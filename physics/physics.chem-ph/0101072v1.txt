Abstract

The performance of two recent ab initio computational thermochemistry

schemes, W1 and W2 theory [J.M.L. Martin and G. de Oliveira, J. Chem.

Phys. 111, 1843 (1999)], is assessed for an enlarged sample of thermochemical

data consisting of the ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities in the G2-1

and G2-2 sets, as well as the heats of formation in the G2-1 and a subset of the

G2-2 set. We ﬁnd W1 theory to be several times more accurate for ionization

potentials and electron aﬃnities than commonly used (and less expensive)

computational thermochemistry schemes such as G2, G3, and CBS-QB3: W2

theory represents a slight improvement for electron aﬃnities but no signiﬁ-

cant one for ionization potentials. The use of a two-point A + B/L5 rather

than a three-point A + B/C L extrapolation for the SCF component greatly

enhances the numerical stability of the W1 method for systems with slow

basis set convergence. Inclusion of ﬁrst-order spin-orbit coupling is essential

for accurate ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities involving degenerate

electronic states: inner-shell correlation is somewhat more important for ion-

ization potentials than for electron aﬃnities, while scalar relativistic eﬀects are

required for the highest accuracy. The mean deviation from experiment for

1

the G2-1 heats of formation is within the average experimental uncertainty.

W1 theory appears to be a valuable tool for obtaining benchmark quality

proton aﬃnities.

I. INTRODUCTION

Development of models based on molecular orbital theory for theoretical thermochemistry

involves ﬁve key steps [1]: deﬁning a target accuracy, formulation of theory, implementation

through programs, validating the models against reliable experimental values and predic-

tion on any molecular system by the end user. At present, only ab initio methods can

claim ”chemical accuracy” (commonly deﬁned as 1 kcal/mol) for small and medium sized

molecules. The most popular such methods are the Gaussian-n (Gn) theories [2–4] of Pople

and coworkers (which are based on a combination of additivity approximations and empirical

corrections applied to relatively low-level calculations), followed by the CBS approaches [5–7]

of Petersson and coworkers which are intricate combinations of extrapolation and empirical

correction schemes.

Very recently, Martin and de Oliveira presented two theoretical thermochemistry schemes

known as W1 and W2 (Weizmann-1 and Weizmann-2) theory [8], which aim at ‘benchmark

accuracy’, deﬁned by these authors as 1 kJ/mol (0.24 kcal/mol). For a set of 28 experimen-

tally very precisely known molecular total atomization energies, the more cost-eﬀective of

the two schemes, W1 theory, achieved a mean absolute error of 0.37 kcal/mol, while the more

rigorous of the two schemes, W2 theory, achieved a mean absolute error of 0.23 kcal/mol. (It

should be pointed out that these methods are free of parameters derived from experiment:

W1 theory does contain one parameter — the exponent for the valence correlation extrap-

olation — that is derived from W2 calculations, not experiment.) Martin later proposed

a minor modiﬁcation of W1 theory, denoted W1′ theory [9], which appeared to yield con-

siderably improved results for second-row compounds at no additional cost. (For ﬁrst-row

compounds, it is identical to W1 theory.)

In recent years, density functional theory (DFT) methods have also reached a level of

sophistication where they can provide thermochemical data to within a few kcal/mol, notably

the hybrid B3LYP (Becke 3-parameter exchange with Lee-Yang-Parr correlation [10,11])

and B97 (Becke 1997 [12]) exchange-correlation functionals, but also the ‘pure DFT’ HCTH

3

(Hamprecht-Cohen-Tozer-Handy [13]) exchange-correlation functional. A recent collection

of reviews on computational thermochemistry methods may be found in an ACS Symposia

volume edited by Irikura and Frurip. [14]

The most fundamental thermochemical property of a compound, from an experimental

point of view, is its heat of formation (∆H ◦

f ) in the gas phase. From a computational chem-

istry point of view, the total atomization energy (TAE, ΣD0) [15] is the most fundamental

such quantity. Using the experimental heats of formation of the atoms in the gas phase,

TAEs can be directly related to the gas-phase heats of formation.

Prior to proper application of any new model by the end user, it should be tested against

known high quality experimental results. For this purpose, Pople and coworkers proposed

two standard test sets of thermochemical data: the G2-1 test set [3] being the smaller and

containing small molecules, and the G2-2 test set [16,17] containing larger systems. These

sets of thermochemical data, covering 148 neutral and 146 ionic species, have been used

fairly extensively (e.g. [18]) to test the performance of various computational thermochem-

istry methods, notably the Gn theories and their variants [16,17,19–22], density functional

methods [16,17,23,24], and the CBS family of methods [5–7,25].

The main problem with the G2-1 and G2-2 test sets for heats of formation is the limited

accuracy of the experimental data themselves. These were critically reviewed by Liebman

and Johnson [26], who concluded that less than half of the data even met the less rigorous 1

kcal/mol accuracy criterion. For methods of the W1/W1′/W2 type, this is clearly a major

impediment to their validation for a larger experimental data set, and alternatives need to

be sought.

Pople and coworkers also deﬁned G2-1 [3] and G2-2 [17] data sets for ionization potentials

and electron aﬃnities. The accuracy of these experimental data is much more satisfactory,

and it could be argued that they are in fact more suitable test sets for the validation of

theoretical thermochemistry methods. While ionization potentials are comparatively easy to

reproduce well, electron aﬃnities are a very taxing test for any electronic structure method.

This is true both in terms of the basis set (addition of the electron entails a profound change

4

in the spatial extent of the wave function) and in terms of the electron correlation method

(eﬀectively, the number of interacting electrons in the system changes).

The purpose of the present paper is to assess the performance of W1 and W2 theory for

an extended data set of thermochemical data. Speciﬁcally, for W1 theory we shall consider

the G2-1 and G2-2 datasets for ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities, as well as the

G2-1 and a subset of the G2-2 data set for heats of formation. W2 theory will be considered

for the G2-1 data set for IPs, EAs, and heats of formation. Finally we shall turn to W1 and

W2 theory for proton aﬃnities.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

Geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations using the B3LYP (Becke

3-parameter-Lee-Yang-Parr [10,11]) density functional method have been carried out using

Gaussian 98 revision A7 [27]. (Following the recommendations in Ref. [28] larger grids than

the default were used in the DFT calculations if necessary, speciﬁcally a pruned (99,590)

grid for integration and gradients, and a pruned (50,194) grid for the solution of the coupled

perturbed Kohn-Sham equations.) All other calculations were carried out using MOLPRO

98.1 [29] and a driver for the W1/W2 calculations [30] written in MOLPRO’s scripting

language. The lion’s share of the calculations was carried out on a Compaq ES40 with four

667 MHz Alpha EV67 CPUs, and a scratch volume consisting of six 18GB SCSI 2 ultrawide

disks striped in software. Remaining calculations were carried out on the SGI Origin 2000

of the Faculty of Chemistry.

The SCF and valence correlation basis sets are Dunning’s augmented correlation consis-

tent n-tuple zeta [31–33] (aug-cc-pVnZ) basis sets; for second-row atoms, high-exponent d

and f functions were added (denoted ’+2d’ or ’+2d1f’) as was found repeatedly [34,35] to be

necessary for accommodating inner-shell correlation eﬀects. (Unless indicated otherwise, reg-

ular ‘un-augmented’ cc-pVnZ basis sets are used for H, Li, and Be, as well as cc-pVnZ+2d1f

for Na and Mg.) For all remaining steps (inner-shell correlation, scalar relativistic eﬀects,

and spin-orbit coupling), the MTsmall (Martin-Taylor small [8]) core correlation basis set

5

was used. Restricted open-shell wave functions were used throughout for open-shell species.

The W1/W2 energy consists of seven components, each of which we shall detail in turn

for reasons of clarity and self-containedness.

(0) Reference geometries are obtained at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 level in the case of W1

theory, and at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ+1 level in the case of W2 theory.

In both cases,

the ‘+1’ signiﬁes the addition [36] of a high-exponent d function to second-row elements,

the exponent having been set equal to the highest d exponent in the corresponding cc-pV5Z

(1) In the original W1 and W2 papers, the SCF limit was obtained by geometric extrapo-

basis set.

lation [37]

T AESCF(n) = T AESCF,∞ + A.Bn

(1)

of the molecular total atomization energy TAE computed using cc-pVnZ+2d1f basis sets,

where for W2 theory n = {T, Q, 5} (with l={3,4,5}), and for W1 theory n = {D, T, Q}

(with l={2,3,4}). (In practice, this means that T AESCF,∞ = T AESCF,n − (T AESCF,n −

T AESCF,n−1)2/(T AESCF,n − 2T AESCF,n−1 + T AESCF,n−2). The exponential convergence

behavior of the SCF energy has repeatedly been demonstrated empirically (e.g. by Jensen

[38] and by Martin and Taylor [39]) in comparisons with numerical Hartree-Fock energies

for small molecules.

The geometric formula, for this particular application, has the minor disadvantage that

its extrapolated limit depends on whether the extrapolation is carried out on TAE, or on the

constituent energies. (In practice the diﬀerences are quite minor.) Based on the asymptotic

convergence behavior [40–42] of the pair energy in an electron pair that does not have an

interelectronic cusp, Petersson and coworkers [43] previously considered (within the context
6.

of their CBS family of methods) an alternative formula ESCF(n) = ESCF,∞ + P

∞
l=n+1

A
l+1/2

(Using Euler-Maclaurin summation, we ﬁnd this to be equivalent to the simple two-point

formula ESCF(n) = ESCF,∞ + A/n5 + O(n−7).) Martin and Taylor [44] previously considered

the diﬀerence between the three-point geometric formula (with n={T,Q,5}) and the two-

point formula (with n={Q,5}) for a small set of molecules and found the diﬀerences to be

6

negligible. We also ﬁnd this to be the case for the much larger sample of molecules surveyed

here.

However, when considering three-point geometric n={D,T,Q} versus two-point n={T,Q}

in the present work, we found that, while the diﬀerences are quite small for almost all ﬁrst-

row and most second-row systems, signiﬁcant diﬀerences (in excess of 1 kcal/mol) exist for

a few ﬁrst-row systems (e.g. LiF) and a rather larger number of second-row systems (e.g.

many silicon compounds). Some conspicuous examples can be found in Table I. Upon

closer inspection, this was revealed to be caused by the three points lying nearly on a

straight line, causing the geometric extrapolation to yield erratic results. The two-point

extrapolation is invariably closer to the extrapolated limit obtained from the larger basis sets:

in unproblematic cases, it yields essentially the same results as the three-point extrapolation.

As a result, we are recommending that the two-point A + B/l5 extrapolation be used in W1

and W2 theory from now on: one beneﬁcial side eﬀect is that the extrapolated limit for this

two-point formula is easily seen to be independent of whether the extrapolation is carried

out on the molecule or the constituent atoms. Since the SCF component was the only

component for which such an ambiguity existed in the original W1 and W2 theory, this

permits the quoting of ”total W1 and W2 energies” for arbitrary systems.

It is also seen in Table I that the main argument in favor of W1′ theory (in which the

AVTZ+2d1f basis set is replaced by an AVTZ+2d basis set, for balance reasons [9]) over

standard W1 theory, namely an SCF limit in better agreement with that obtained from

larger basis sets, appears to be obviated by the new extrapolation. We shall not consider

W1′ theory further in the course of this paper.

(2) In the W2 case, the CCSD (coupled cluster with all singles and doubles [45]) va-

lence correlation contribution to TAE is obtained using the aug-cc-pVQZ+2d1f and aug-

cc-pV5Z+2d1f basis sets, then extrapolated to the inﬁnite basis limit using the expression

[46] E(l) = E∞ + A/L3. (In practice, this means E∞ = El + (El − El−1)/(( l

l−1)3 − 1).)

The arguments in favor of this expression (derived from the known asymptotic conver-

gence behavior of the interelectronic cusp [40–42]) have been detailed at length elsewhere

7

[8,46,47] and will not be repeated here. In the W1 case, the unmodiﬁed expression leads

to systematically overestimated correlation contributions to TAE [8]: here we employ

E∞ = El + (El − El−1)/(( l

l−1)α − 1), where α = 3.22 was determined [8] to yield the

best agreement with the extrapolated W2 CCSD energies. Both for W1 and W2 theory, the

largest basis set CCSD calculation is carried out (except for very small systems) using the

direct CCSD algorithm of Sch¨utz, Lindh, and Werner [48] as implemented in MOLPRO98.1.

(3) The contribution of connected triple excitations is obtained at the CCSD(T) level (CCSD

with a quasiperturbative a posteriori correction for connected triple excitations [49]). As the

T3 contribution is known [50] to converge more rapidly than the contribution of exp(T1 + T2),

hence this contribution is obtained from CCSD(T) calculations with the smaller two basis

sets and extrapolated to the inﬁnite-basis limit using E∞ = El + (El − El−1)/(( l

l−1)α − 1),

where, as for the CCSD energy, α=3 exactly for W2 theory and α=3.22 for W1 theory. (For

open-shell systems, the deﬁnitions of the restricted CCSD and CCSD(T) energy as given in

Ref. [51] has been used.)

(4) The inner-shell correlation contribution is computed as the diﬀerence between

CCSD(T)/MTsmall [8] values with and without constraining the inner-shell orbitals to be

doubly occupied.

(In the case of the second-row elements, the very deep-lying (1s)-like

orbitals are constrained to be doubly occupied throughout.)

(5) The scalar relativistic contribution is computed as expectation values of the one-electron

Darwin and mass-velocity (DMV) operators [52,53] for the ACPF/MTsmall (averaged cou-

pled pair functional [54]) wave function, with all inner-shell electrons correlated except the

(1s)-like orbitals of second-row elements. Bauschlicher [55] demonstrated that, for ﬁrst-

and second-row systems, this approach yields essentially identical results to more rigorous

relativistic calculations.

(6) For closed-shell systems, or open-shell systems in nondegenerate electronic states, there

is no molecular ﬁrst-order spin-orbit contribution, and the contribution to TAE is merely

the sum of the atomic spin-orbit corrections. For open-shell systems in degenerate states,

we have calculated spin-orbit corrections at the CISD level with the MTsmall basis set, and

again correlating all electrons except for the (1s) on second-row elements.

(7) The molecular zero-point energy and thermal corrections were obtained at the

B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 level. The zero-point energies within the harmonic approximation are

scaled by 0.985, primarily to correct for anharmonicity. The scale factor was obtained [8] by

comparison with experimental (or high-level theoretical) anharmonic zero-point energies for

EA0 = T AE0(anion) − T AE0(neutral)

Likewise, the (adiabatic) ionization potentials (IPs) are calculated as the diﬀerence in total

atomization energies at 0 K of the cation and the corresponding neutral, at their respective

optimized geometries:

IP0 = T AE0(neutral) − T AE0(cation)

Theoretical heats of formation at 0 K were calculated by subtracting the Wn calculated

TAE0 (ΣD0) value from experimental enthalpies of formation of the isolated atoms. For any

molecule, such as AxByHz, the heat of formation at 0 K is given by

∆H 0

f (AxByHz, 0K) = x∆H 0

f (A, 0K) + y∆H 0

f (B, 0K) + z∆H 0

f (H, 0K) − ΣD0.

(4)

The CODATA [56] values of the atomic ∆H 0

f are used with the exception of boron and

silicon, for which we have used revised values recommended by Bauschlicher, Martin, and

Taylor [57,58] for boron and by Martin and Taylor [59] for silicon. Theoretical heats of

formation at 298 K (∆H ◦

f ) are calculated by correction to ∆H 0

f as follows:

∆H 0

f (AxByHz, 298K) = ∆H 0

f (AxByHz, 0K)

+ [H o(AxByHz, 298K) − H o(AxByHz, 0K)]

While the enthalpy functions hcfT ≡ HT −H0 for the molecule are obtained using the RRHO

(rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator) approximation from the unscaled B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1 vi-

brational frequencies, the enthalpy functions for the standard states of the elements are taken

directly from CODATA.

Proton aﬃnities (PA) are obtained from the total atomization energies at 0 K as follows:

P A0(B) = T AE0(BH+) − T AE0(B)

Finally, PAs at 298 K are calculated by correction to PA0 as follows:

P A298(B) = P A0(B) + hcf 298(BH +) − hcf 298(B) −

III. TEST SETS USED

The original G2-1 ion test set consists of 25 EAs and 38 IPs while the G2-2 test set

included 33 EAs and 50 IPs. In the G3 paper, Curtiss et al. [4] applied G3 theory to the

G2-1 and G2-2 test sets, minus three ionization potentials (due to the size of the molecules

concerned). In this study we exclude ﬁve additional ionization potentials and one electron

aﬃnity from the G2-2 test set, for the same reason. Both W1 and W2 theories were evaluated

for the G2-1 test set, while only W1 theory was considered for the G2-2 test set. For the

purpose of evaluation of ∆H ◦

f , the original G2-1 neutral test set consists of 55 molecules

while the G2-2 test set includes 93 molecules. Again, we have considered both W1 and W2

theories for the G2-1 neutral test set of molecules and compared the results with G2, G3 and

CBS-Q values. (For the W2 calculations, three species were omitted because of their size.)

It should be noted that the G2-2 test set contains several fairly large molecules and some

of the experimental ∆H ◦

f for the species in G2-2 test set possess large uncertainties as well

as several experimental values spanning a wide range. Therefore, we have selected a subset

of 27 out of the 93 G2-2 neutral molecules, which are tractably small and for which the

experimental enthalpies are reasonably accurate. To these molecules we applied W1 theory,

and to a subset of them W2 theory.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Electron Aﬃnities

We shall ﬁrst consider the G2-1 test set. A comparison between various levels of theory

(including W1, W2, G2, G3, and CBS-Q) and experiment is given in Table III, while a

breakdown of the diﬀerent components of the W1 values is given in Table II.

We note ﬁrst that a substantial number of species have negative electron aﬃnities at

the SCF level: the binding of the electron results from the additional correlation energy in

those cases.

Inclusion of connected triple excitations is essential.

In contrast, inner-shell

correlation does not appear to be very important for the G2-1 EAs. Scalar relativistic eﬀects

are somewhat more important: with the exception of CH2, CH3, and SiH3 they uniformly

decrease the electron aﬃnity. As expected, the scalar relativistic eﬀect is somewhat more

important in second-row than in ﬁrst-row systems. The change in the zero-point energies

can be fairly substantial, particularly for hydrides.

For heats of formation of closed-shell systems (and open-shell systems with nondegenerate

ground states), the molecular ﬁrst-order spin-orbit splitting vanishes, reducing the spin-orbit

correction to the sum of the corrections for the constituent atoms. Since a fair number of the

species in the G2-1 set have a degenerate state for either the neutral or the anionic system (or

in fact for both), some account for molecular spin-orbit coupling cannot be avoided. We have

considered a number of (relatively) inexpensive approximations within the MTsmall basis

set used for the core correlation and scalar relativistic steps, including SCF, CISD, and CISD

with inner-shell electrons correlated. The computed corrections at these levels of theory for

a number of (neutral, cationic, and anionic) species have been compared in Table IV with

values obtained from experimental ﬁne structures. For most ﬁrst-row species, satisfactory

results are already obtained at the SCF and deﬁnitely at the CISD level; for the second-

row species, correlation from the (2s2p) inner-shell orbitals appears to be essential, as was

previously found by de Oliveira et al. [60] for the 2nd-row atoms and by Nicklass et al. [61]

in a convergence study for the halogen atoms. (The rather weak basis set dependence found

11

by these latter authors [61] is consistent with our own ﬁndings.) Only for the ClO molecule

we ﬁnd a substantial error: inspection of the spectroscopic constants [62] for the few lowest

states reveals that the X 2Π ground state in fact has a anomalously small splitting compared

to the A 2Π state; since this latter state mixes in quite prominently into the X 2Π wave

function, the splitting is severely underestimated unless the A 2Π state is admitted to the

zero-order wave function. Using a CASSCF reference space consisting of the valence orbitals

except for the Cl(3s) and O(2s) like orbitals, and supplemented with the ﬁrst Rydberg π

orbitals, yields a spin-orbit correction in excellent agreement with experiment.

As can be seen from Table II, these spin-orbit corrections are in fact essential for good

agreement with experiment for several of the systems. At the W1 level, we ﬁnd a mean abso-

lute discrepancy (MAD) from experiment of 0.016 eV (Table III), which is a quite substantial

improvement over the G2 (0.057 eV), G3 (0.049 eV), and CBS-QB3 (0.054 eV) values. Per-

haps even more importantly, the maximum error is likewise much smaller, 0.051 eV for CH3,

followed by 0.043 eV for SiH2.

In the case of CH3, not only is the electron aﬃnity very

small (G3 and CBS-QB3 in fact predict the wrong sign), but the harmonic approximation

for the zero-point energy is of dubious reliability (see Schwenke [63]). W2 represents a minor

improvement over W1, at vastly greater computational expense: MAD=0.012 eV. Using

even larger basis sets, de Oliveira et al. [60] found the mean absolute error for the atoms H,

B–F, and Al–Cl to be 0.009 eV at the CCSD(T) level; by employing CCSDT and full CI

corrections, this error could be reduced by an order of magnitude. (The importance of these

corrections was about evenly split between higher-order T3 eﬀects and eﬀects of connected

quadruple excitations, T4.) We conclude that the accuracy of W2 theory (and, to a lesser

extent, W1 theory) is mostly determined by the imperfections in the CCSD(T) method.

We shall now consider the G2-2 set of electron aﬃnities, for which only W1 (not W2)

calculations were carried out. A breakdown of contributions is given in Table V, while a

comparison with other theoretical thermochemistries and with experiment is given in Table

VI.

The trends seen for the G2-1 set largely continue for the G2-2 set. However, inner-shell

12

correlation is somewhat more important for some species (e.g. Al, because of the small

subvalence/valence gap, C2, and S2O). One exception to the general trends is that electron

correlation in fact decreases EA(C2): this is an artifact of the multireference character of

the X 1Σ+

g state. At ﬁrst sight, scalar relativistic eﬀects seem less important, but this is an

artifact of the relative preponderance of ﬁrst-row species compared to the G2-2 set.

Standard W1 results for Li and Na would not involve diﬀuse functions on these low-

electronegativity atoms. Not surprisingly, very poor electron aﬃnities are thus obtained.

We have optimized diﬀuse functions (available in the supplementary material) for Li, Be,

Na, and Mg to accompany the standard cc-pVnZ basis set: the exponents were optimized

individually for each angular momentum at the CISD level for the atomic anion. The W1aug

results obtained with these basis sets are in near-perfect agreement with experiment. (This

can reasonably be expected since the electron correlation methods used are exact within the

ﬁnite basis set for the valence correlation contributions.)

As for the G2-1 set, we ﬁnd W1 theory to be quite substantially more reliable than G2

and G3 theory. Substantial discrepancies between W1 theory and experiment are found for

ozone, CH2NC, and FO: the ﬁrst two species (and, to a lesser extent, FO) exhibit strong

nondynamical correlation eﬀects, and hence methods that do not include corrections for cor-

relation eﬀects beyond CCSD(T) are expected to yield poor results. G3 theory fortuitously

agrees better with experiment than W1 theory for these species.

B. Ionization Potentials

We shall again ﬁrst consider the G2-1 set. A breakdown of components in the W1

computed values can be found in Table VII, while a comparison with experiment and less

expensive theoretical thermochemistry methods can be found in Table VIII. The relative

importance of correlation is smaller than for the electron aﬃnities: yet in absolute terms its

contribution is almost as signiﬁcant as in the EA case. While connected triple excitations

appear to be somewhat less important than for EAs, they can certainly not be neglected

with impunity. Inner-shell correlation contributions, on the other hand, are more important

13

than in the EA case because the valence excitation creates a “hole” into which core electrons

can be excited. The large contributions for Na (4 kcal/mol) and Mg (2 kcal/mol) come as

no surprise given the small core-valence gap in these atoms. Scalar relativistic contributions

are important for accurate work: with the exception of Li–C and Na–Mg, they consistently

lower the IP. Like for the EAs, we see substantial zero-point eﬀects for the hydrides: in the

case of CH4, this contribution is especially large because of the known ﬂuxional nature [64] of

the CH+

4 cation. And again, spin-orbit splitting is a factor to be reckoned with, particularly

for such second-row species as exhibit ﬁrst-order spin-orbit splitting.

Agreement with experiment is highly satisfactory at the W1 level, except for CH4 where

an atypically large discrepancy is seen. Upon inspection, it is revealed that the B3LYP/cc-

pVTZ geometry for CH+

4 is qualitatively incorrect, exhibiting D2 rather than C2v symmetry.

This reﬂects itself both in an error in the total energy for the cation and in an error in the

zero-point contribution. Using a CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ reference geometry, excellent agreement

with experiment is in fact obtained.

In an attempt to ascertain whether this issue is speciﬁc to the B3LYP exchange-

correlation functional, we carried out geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency

calculations for CH+

4 using the cc-pVTZ basis set and a variety of exchange-correlation

functionals, including B3P86 (Becke 3-parameter exchange with Perdew-1986 correlation

[65]), B3PW91 (Becke 3-parameter exchange with Perdew-Wang-1991 correlation [66]),

mPW1PW91 (modiﬁed Perdew-Wang [67]), mPW1K (Truhlar’s empirical modiﬁcation of

the latter [68]), BHLYP (Becke half-and-half exchange [69] with LYP correlation), BHPW91

(ditto with PW91 correlation), and BLYP (Becke 1988 exchange [70] with LYP correlation).

Results are summarized in Table IX. Only the functionals with 50% Hartree-Fock exchange

(BHLYP, BHPW91) or nearly so (mPW1K) ﬁnd this structure to be a local minimum, while

all other functionals ﬁnd an imaginary frequency of a2 symmetry. Following the latter down-

hill leads to the D2d structure. Given that this behavior persists with a fairly wide variety

of correlation functionals, the problem appears to reside in the exchange functional. (Note

that since W1 theory does not contain any parameters that depend on the level of theory

14

for the reference geometry, it can quite well be carried out from, say, a mPW1K/cc-pVTZ

reference geometry for systems which exhibit this type of problem.)

Mean absolute deviation for W1 is a factor of 3–4 smaller than for the inexpensive

methods.

In this case, only marginal improvement is seen upon going to the much more

expensive W2 method, which is easily understood in terms of the faster basis set convergence

for the cation compared to the anion. Again, we have reason to believe that the principal

factor limiting the accuracy of our calculations are small deﬁciencies in the CCSD(T) electron

correlation method.

Let us now consider the G2-2 ionization potentials (Tables X and XI). Most systems in

that set do not exhibit ﬁrst-order spin-orbit splitting, the main exceptions being Ne, Ar, OCS,

and CS2. Most trends from the G2-1 set are continued: one clear exception to the general rule

is CN, for which electron correlation reduces the IP. At ﬁrst sight, this system also exhibits a

large discrepancy of 0.27 eV between theory and experiment, and discrepancies for the more

approximate G2 and G3 methods are similarly high. An explanation in terms of the extreme

multireference character of the CN+ cation would be tempting: however, we repeated the W2

calculation using full valence CAS-ACPF instead of CCSD(T) at every step, and found an

increase by 0.04 eV in our computed value (to 13.93 eV). Upon closer inspection, it appears

that the ‘experimental’ IP(CN)=13.6 eV is in fact a propagated transcription error from Ref.

[71]. The only experimental value without a large error bar, 14.03±0.02 eV, was obtained

by Berkowitz et al. [72] from photoionization data for HCN→H++CN+e− (19.00±0.01 eV)

and HCN→H+CN++e− (19.43±0.01 eV), as well as the well-established IP(H). The error

bars on the extrapolated ionization limits may be somewhat optimistic: in addition, it is well

known from benchmark calculations (e.g. [73]: see also [74]) that CN− has a very low-lying

a 3Π state (Te=880±100 cm−1 [73], or 0.11 eV). It is not inconceivable that the Berkowitz

et al. value in fact corresponds to generation of the 3Π state (especially since the ground

state of HCN+ is X 2Π): our W1 and W2 computed IPs in that case are both 14.07 eV, in

excellent agreement with the Berkowitz value. This problem merits further investigation.

For the purpose of assessment of the error statistics of the various methods, however,

15

we have removed IP(CN) from the sample. Signiﬁcant discrepancies — out of character

with the other results — are then still seen for B2H4, sec-C3H7, Si2H6, and CH3OF. None of

these species exhibits severe nondynamical correlation, and we note that there are signiﬁcant

discrepancies between G3 and experiment for all these species except Si2H6. We suggest that

these experimental values may need to be reconsidered. In the case of B2H4, it has previously

been suggested [75] that the surface between the D2d structure and the doubly bridged C2v

isomer is ﬂat enough that rigid molecule treatments may not be appropriate. The remaining

three cases contain internal rotations, likewise casting doubt on the applicability of the

RRHO approximation for the zero-point energy. (For both B2H4 and Si2H6, W2 calculations

were feasible, and were found to yield essentially the same result as the W1 calculation.)

Neither neutral nor cationic systems exhibit appreciable multireference character which could

negatively aﬀect the quality of the W1 and W2 results. Upon eliminating the four doubtful

species, we ﬁnd a MAD for the G2-2 test set that is only slightly higher than for the G2-1

set. Regardless of whether these four species are eliminated, it is clear that W1 represents a

signiﬁcant improvement over G2 and G3 theory.

C. Heats of Formation

We shall ﬁnally turn to heats of formation for a larger set of molecules than was considered

in the original W1/W2 paper. A breakdown by components of the atomization energies of

the G2-1 set of neutral molecules is given in Table XII, while a comparison with experiment

and more approximate methods can be found in Table XIII.

First of all, we note that the mean uncertainty for the experimental values is itself 0.6

kcal/mol. In fact, the MAD values for W1 and W2 theory stand at 0.6 and 0.5 kcal/mol,

respectively, suggesting that these theoretical values are in the same reliability range as the

experimental data. The MAD for W2 theory is more than twice as large as in the original

W1/W2 paper: however, comparisons there were made against a smaller set of molecules for

which the experimental uncertainties were all 0.25 kcal/mol or less, mostly 0.1 kcal/mol or

less.

16

For ten species do discrepancies between W1 theory and experiment reach or exceed 1

kcal/mol. Out of these, four experimental values carry uncertainties of 1 kcal/mol or more,

and can be ignored. Of the remaining six, the experimental heat of formation of SiH4 contains

an ambiguity [76], P2 is a notoriously diﬃcult molecule [77] and carries an uncertainty of

0.5 kcal/mol, and ClO is strongly multireference and carries an uncertainty of 0.5 kcal/mol.

(For this latter molecule, however, ‘upgrading’ the calculation to W2 theory reduces the

discrepancy with experiment to 0.5 kcal/mol, suggesting that slow basis set convergence

may be at stake here.) As for Si2H6, W1, W2, G2, and CBS-Q theories exhibit similar

discrepancies from experiment (G3 a somewhat smaller one), strongly suggesting that the

experimental value may be in error.

We note that W1/W2 and the less expensive methods “err” in the same direction for P2

and ClO as well, suggesting that some revision of the experimental data may be in order there

as well. Revisions for BeH and NH2 were suggested previously [78]: all methods unanimously

suggest the PH2 value to be in error.

As pointed out repeatedly [79], the JANAF heat of formation for SiH4 is in fact the

older Gunn and Green value [80] increased by a somewhat arbitrary term of 1 kcal/mol for

a Si(amorphous)→Si(cr) phase change. The W1 and W2 results, like a previous benchmark

study [81], favor the older Gunn-Green value.

Finally, we selected 26 species with relatively small error bars out of the 93 molecules

in the G2-2 test set for heats of formation. A summary of our computed TAEs and their

diﬀerent components for the 27 G2-2 neutral test molecules set calculated at the W1 level is

presented in Table XIV, while the experimental ∆H ◦

f along with deviation of W1, G2, and

G3 values from experiment are presented in Table XV.

The average discrepancy between the W1 values and experiment for this subset is 0.7

kcal/mol, compared to an average experimental uncertainty of 0.4 kcal/mol.

In order to

establish the reason for some of the discrepancies, we have carried out W2 calculations on

selected systems.

In the case of BF3 and CF4, the culprit appears to be slow basis set convergence in

17

these highly ionic systems. We were unable to complete the CCSD/aug-cc-pV5Z calculation

for CF4: but applying the W1 and W2 extrapolations to the published CCSD(T)/aug-cc-

pVnZ (n=3,4 and 4,5, respectively) total energies for CF4 of Dixon et al. [82], we found the

estimated W2 TAE to be 1.5 kcal/mol lower than the estimated W1 TAE. This accounts

for essentially all the discrepancy between experiment and W1 theory for CF4. (A similar

phenomenon was previously noted for BF3 [58].) The NO2 molecule exhibits strong nondy-

namical correlation eﬀects, and the W2 result is actually further removed from experiment

than the W1 result. ClNO likewise exhibits substantial nondynamical correlation, and here

the W2 result is basically identical to its W1 counterpart. Improving agreement with experi-

ment for these two molecules will certainly require accounting for correlation eﬀects neglected

at the CCSD(T) level. While this may be true to a lesser extent of the N2O molecule, an

error in the experimental value cannot completely be ruled out there.

For F2O, the discrepancies of -0.8 (W1) and -1.0 (W2) kcal/mol with experiment, as well

as the absence of signiﬁcant nondynamical correlation, suggest that the experimental value

may need to be reinvestigated.

At least for some of the larger systems (as well as those which have internal rotations),

neglect of anharmonicity in the zero-point energy may account for part of the discrepancy

with experiment.

D. Proton aﬃnities

Curtiss et al. [4], in the original G3 paper, considered proton aﬃnities of eight molecules

as well. We have calculated W1 and W2 proton aﬃnities for the same systems. However,

rather than the somewhat older experimental data used by these authors, we have taken the

data from the very recent compilation by Hunter and Lias [83]. A breakdown of the diﬀerent

components at the W1 level is given in Table XVI, while various methods are compared with

experiment in Table XVII.

Since protonation/deprotonation is an isogyric reaction, the proton aﬃnity converges

considerably more rapidly with the level of theory than, say, the heat of formation. (This

18

is expressed, for instance, in the comparatively small contribution of valence correlation,

and the quite small contributions of inner-shell correlation and scalar relativistic eﬀects.)

Indeed, we note that only minute diﬀerences exist between the W1 and W2 proton aﬃnities:

W1 theory can basically be considered converged for this purpose. Mean absolute deviation

from experiment is 0.43 kcal/mol (compared to 1.2 kcal/mol for the inexpensive G3 theory).

While only a few of the values in Hunter and Lias carry explicit error bars (e.g. water, ±0.7

kcal/mol, H2S, ±1.3 kcal/mol), it is clear that the uncertainty on the computed W1 values

is considerably lower than that of the experimental values themselves (with the exception of

H2, for which the Hunter and Lias value is a theoretical one). As such, W1 theory should be

a powerful tool for obtaining benchmark-quality proton aﬃnities: for application to larger

systems, the inner-shell correlation and scalar relativistic steps can fairly safely be skipped

for this application.

The somewhat surprising diﬀerence of 0.4 kcal/mol for PA(H2) (after all, both unpro-

tonated and protonated systems should be treatable essentially exactly at this level) is in

part due to the harmonic approximation for the zero-point energy. We have calculated

CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ quartic force ﬁelds for H2 and H+

3 , and found that the anharmonic zero-

point energies thus obtained lead to PA(H2)=101.10 kcal/mol, or only 0.2 kcal/mol higher

than the evaluated Hunter and Lias value.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have assessed the performance of two recently developed methods for benchmark-

quality computational thermochemistry, W1 and W2 theory, for a fairly large set of heats

of formation, as well as for the G2-1 and G2-2 sets of ionization potentials and electron

aﬃnities, and a number of proton aﬃnities.

For molecules which exhibit slow basis set convergence, the numerical stability of the W1

method is considerably enhanced by substituting the three-point geometric extrapolation of

the SCF component, ESCF (L) = ESCF,∞ + A/BL, by a two-point extrapolation ESCF (L) =

ESCF,∞ + A/L5 which does not involve results with the smallest of the three valence basis

19

sets.

W1 theory performs excellently for ionization potentials, achieving a mean absolute de-

viation (MAD) of 0.013 eV for the G2-1 set and 0.018 eV for the G2-2 set (minus CN, B2H4,

sec-C3H7, Si2H6, and CH3OF). Both mean and maximum errors are several times smaller

than those of other, less expensive, theoretical thermochemistry methods. The vastly more

expensive W2 method (which uses the same correlation methods but larger basis sets) yields

only a marginal improvement over the W1 method: it appears that the main impediments

to greater accuracy for these properties are the residual imperfections (higher-order T3, T4)

in the CCSD(T) method.

The performance of W1 theory for electron aﬃnities is similar, with a MAD of 0.016

eV for the G2-1 and 0.019 eV for the G2-2 set. The latter value is reduced to 0.016 eV if

two strongly multireference systems (O3 and CH2NC) are eliminated. For the G2-1 set, W2

theory (MAD=0.012 eV) does represent a minor improvement over W1 theory, reﬂecting the

stronger basis set sensitivity of electron aﬃnities.

Inner-shell correlation is somewhat more important for ionization potentials than for

electron aﬃnities: scalar relativistic eﬀects cannot be neglected for either property if results

of the highest accuracy are desired. For IPs or EAs involving systems in degenerate states,

spin-orbit splitting corrections are essential. With the exception of ClO (where a fairly large

active space is required for good results), suﬃciently accurate spin-orbit splittings can be

computed at the CISD/MTsmall level provided the (2s2p) orbitals on second-row atoms are

included in the correlation.

Comparison with experiment for the heats of formation in the G2-1 and (part of) the

G2-2 set is complicated somewhat by the uncertainties in the experimental values: the

MADs of both W1 and W2 theory are lower than the average experimental uncertainty. For

parametrizing more approximate methods, W1 and especially W2 level heats of formation

may well be more suitable than the experimental data.

Computed proton aﬃnities at the W1 level appear to be converged with the level of

theory, and agree excellently with experiment.

20

As a ﬁnal conclusion, we have established that the previously proposed W1 and W2

theories are in fact valuable and powerful tools for accurate ab initio thermochemistry, with

mean and maximum absolute errors that are several times smaller than those of more popular

(and less expensive) schemes such as G2, G3, and CBS-Q/CBS-QB3.

Abstract

Motivated by solid-state studies on the cleavage force in Si, and the consequent
stretching of chemical bonds, we here study bond stretching in the, as yet unsynthe-
sized, free space molecule Si6H6. We address the question as to whether substantial
bond stretching (but constrained to uniform scaling on all bonds) can result in a
transition from ring current behaviour, characteristic say of benzene at its equi-
librium geometry, to localized π-electrons on Si atoms. Some calculations are also
recorded on dissociation into 6 SiH radicals. While the main studies have been
carried out by unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, the inﬂuence of electron cor-
relation has been examined using two forms of density functional theory. Planar
Si6H6 treated by HF is bound to be unstable, not all vibrational frequencies being
real. Some buckling is then allowed, which results in real frequencies and stability.
Evidence is then provided that the non-planar structure, as the Si–Si distance is
increased, exhibits π-electron localization in the range 1.2–1.5 times the equilibrium
distance.

Key words: bond stretching, Si6H6, C6H6 (benzene), metal-insulator transition.

1 Introduction

In a fairly recent study, Matthai and March [1] have used a coordination-dependent force
ﬁeld constructed by Tersoﬀ [2] for crystalline Si, to calculate the cleavage force for two
diﬀerent cleavage planes. This led them to propose that Si-Si bonds in the diamond lattice
structure have comparable elasticity to the bond in the free space H2 molecule. Coulson
and Fischer [3] made a variational calculation on H2, using asymmetric orbitals centred
on the two protons at separation R, which showed that conventional LCAO-MO was a
viable approach until R reached 1.6R0, with R0 the equilibrium bond length in free space
H2. The cleavage force calculations of Matthai and March [1] led to a slightly larger value
than 1.6, characterizing the elasticity of the Si-Si bond in crystalline Si.

This has motivated us to study the stretching of Si-Si bonds in a diﬀerent chem-
ical environment, namely Si6H6 in free space. Of course, in this, as yet unsynthesized,
molecule, the natural ‘zero-order’ hybrids are quasi-sp2 in character, in contrast to sp3
in the diamond lattice structure of Si. Therefore, the new feature in the bond stretch-
ing study undertaken here is the behaviour of the π-electrons, the MOs of which would
conventionally be built, again in zero-order approximation, from linear combinations of
3pz Si orbitals, the z axis being perpendicular to the (assumed) planar molecule, with
appropriate phase factors (see, e.g., Ref. [4]).

It is important to say that strain energies of silicon rings and clusters have been
studied earlier by Zhao and Gimarc [5]. The work on bucky-tori by Babic et al. [6] is also
noteworthy in the same context. Finally, the relatively weak π-bonding ability of silicon
versus carbon is emphasized in the study by Baldridge et al. [7].

The outline of the paper is then as follows. In Sec. 2 immediately below, we record
the results of a spin-compensated Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation of Si6H6. This predicts
a stable molecule which is already ‘bound’ at the HF level, with a substantial binding en-
ergy, even though no successful synthesis has been achieved as yet, as already mentioned.
The spin-compensated HF treatment is then extended to the study of uniformly
scaled Si6H6, in which Si-Si and Si-H bonds are stretched in ‘benzene-like’ geometry
by a common scaling factor λ. This spin-compensated HF treatment is then compared
and contrasted with a less restricted HF study in which, though a single determinantal
wave function is still employed, diﬀerent space orbitals are permitted for diﬀerent spin
directions. Though constraints are still applied (e.g., the multiplicity is inserted), such
spin density states eventually prove to be lower than the spin-compensated HF energy as
the scale factor is increased suﬃciently. Some details of the spin density are also referred to
in Sec. 4 and in the Appendix for the case of benzene. Then, in Sec. 5, we have assessed
the likely changes in the HF results due to electron correlation by employing density
functional theory. The major conclusions of the HF studies remain intact, the binding
of the molecule with respect to SiH radicals being stabilized somewhat by correlation
inclusion.

2 Equilibrium geometry and uniform stretching of Si-Si and Si-H bonds by

a scaling factor

2.1 Equilibrium properties from spin-compensated Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations

In this section we shall ﬁrst record the results of a spin-compensated (restricted) Hartree-
Fock (RHF) calculation on the equilibrium geometry of Si6H6. We also anticipate results
of analogous kind for C6H6, to be referred to in the Appendix. All calculations were
performed with the Gaussian98 program [8] with both a 6-31G∗ and a cc-pVTZ basis set
(for H and C atoms [9], and for Si atoms [10]). The total ground state energy EHF of the
single atoms and radicals (in unrestricted Hartree-Fock, UHF, approximation), and of the
Si6H6 and C6H6 molecules (RHF) are recorded in Table 1, together with the equilibrium
bond lengths. The binding energy relative to 6 Si and 6 H isolated atoms, as well as that
relative to 6 C and 6 H isolated atoms, is also recorded.

2.2 Uniform stretching of all bonds by a common scale factor

With this as background, we turn to consider the stretching of chemical bonds in the Si6H6
molecule. The stretching of Si-Si bonds was referred to already in connection with the
cleavage force in crystalline Si in its diamond structure. Of course, we are now considering
such stretching in (a) a free space environment, and (b) in a situation in which sp2
hybridization is replacing the basic sp3 hybrids of the solid state (see also Stenhouse et
al. [11] for amorphous Si and its electron density distribution). In this section, we shall
conﬁne ourselves to uniform stretching of all Si-Si and Si-H bonds in Si6H6 by a common
scale factor λ.

Fig. 1 shows the ground-state energy E of Si6H6 in hartrees as a function of the
uniform scaling factor λ over a wide range of λ, covering both bond stretching (λ > 1),
and shortening (λ < 1). Equilibrium is achieved for λ = 1 (no stretching), corresponding
to a ‘benzene-like’ (planar) geometry, for which energies and bond lengths are given in
Tab. 1. The dashed line in Fig. 1 refers to the sum of atomic energies: i.e., that of 6 Si and
6 H isolated atoms. Points marked by ﬁlled squares refer to a RHF calculation, whereas
points marked by ﬁlled circles refer to an unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) calculation,
characterized by a state with a non-zero spin density, built still on a single determinantal
wave function, but now allowing diﬀerent space orbitals for diﬀerent spin directions.
All UHF curves here are with spin multiplicity M = 1. It is evident that the UHF
result is always lower in energy than the RHF result, with the former tending to the
correct dissociation limit (dashed line) as λ increases. It is found that the (putative) Si6H6
molecule binds for λ ≃ 0.7 ÷ 1.3, with a binding energy slightly lower than 1 hartree,
measured relative to the dissociation limit.

Concerning the RHF curves, it turns out that as λ increases, the symmetry properties
of the solution change from those near equilibrium, which is the reason of the crossing of
the RHF curves near λ ∼ 1.3 in Fig. 1. Speciﬁcally, while the symmetry of the HF state
is a1g on both branches, the symmetry of the one-electron orbitals in the HF determinant
is diﬀerent. Around equilibrium (λ ≃ 1) we have [a2u,e1g] for the three highest occupied
orbitals, which changes to [b1u,e2g] when bonds are further stretched (λ > 1.3).

We shall return to the discussion of Fig. 1, when we deal with spin density in Sec. 4

15

below. However, we have also performed a variety of HF calculations in which only Si-Si
bonds are uniformly stretched by λ, whereas Si-H bonds are ﬁxed at their equilibrium
bond lengths. The next section is devoted to comparing and contrasting the ground-state
energies with those reported in the present section.

3 Uniform scaling of Si-Si bonds only, with ﬁxed Si-H bond lengths: Disso-

ciation into 6 Si-H radicals

In Fig. 2 we show the RHF and UHF solutions, along with the dissociation limit (dashed
line, corresponding to E = −1736.6298 hartree), in the case where the ring geometry
of the ‘benzene-like’ structure of Si6H6 is uniformly stretched by a factor λ, while the
Si-H bond lengths are kept ﬁxed at their equilibrium value. Naturally, as λ increases,
the present case is energetically favoured with respect to the case of uniform stretching,
because of the gain in chemical binding energy due to the short Si-H bonds.

First, we focus again on the HF singlet case (RHF in Fig. 2). For λ ≃ 1 (Fig. 2),
the ground-state energy is approximately −1737.05 hartree. The RHF solution deviates
from the UHF one more markedly than in the uniformly stretched case, and crosses over
a diﬀerent symmetry branch well above the dissociation limit. Following now the UHF
curve, one observes that in this (albeit somewhat artiﬁcial) geometry, the system stays
bounded only up to λ ≃ 1.3, namely for a smaller stretching than in the uniformly
stretched case, whereas its energy exceeds the dissociation limit at about λ ∼ 1.5, where
it displays a weakly pronounced maximum (in the shape of an energy barrier), before
decaying to the correct dissociation limit, as λ is further increased.

4 Itinerant vs localized π-electrons

Since there is a sense in which UHF calculations reﬂect electron ‘correlation’ by allowing
diﬀerent space orbitals for ↑ and ↓ spins, it is relevant to enquire whether we can draw any
conclusions about itinerant versus localized behaviour of the π-electrons in Si6H6. A form
for comparison is of course the ‘sister’ molecule C6H6. In this latter case, the diamagnetic
susceptibility and properties relating to ring currents testify, from experiment, to the
delocalization of the π-electrons.

In Figs. 3 and 4 we show the spin population magnitudes on the Si and H atoms of
the Si6H6 ring, respectively, as a function of uniform stretching λ. Due to the threefold
rotational symmetry of the lowest energy solution, spin populations had alternating signs
on neighbouring radicals.

Within this approximation, π-electrons have their densities dominantly around the

Si nuclei, with a tendency towards delocalization (ring currents) for low values of λ.

So far we have considered the structure of Si6H6 to be planar. However, a study of
the normal modes of vibration reveals that not all the vibrational frequencies are real.
This has led us to an investigation of the eﬀect of buckling of the planar structure on
these frequencies.

The minimum energy structure has been obtained by means of an optimization proce-
dure at the UHF-Singlet level using a 6-31G∗ basis set. The resulting molecular geometry
is highly symmetric (D3d point group), similar to the cycloesane (C6H12) geometry in

16

the chair conformation. In particular, the Si–Si and Si–H bond lengths are 2.218 ˚A and
1.47 ˚A, respectively, while the valence angles are 119.28◦ for Si–Si–Si and 119.31◦ for Si–
Si–H. In contrast to planar 6-membered rings, in this structure only four atoms belong
to a plane, say Si1–Si2–Si4–Si5, while the other two atoms, say Si3 and Si6, are one below
and one above this plane (Fig. 5). Correspondingly, the angle between the four atoms
plane with the Si2–Si3–Si4 plane is 14.57◦, while the angle between the four atoms plane
and the Si1–Si6–Si5 plane is −14.57◦.

The vibrational analysis conﬁrmed that this structure corresponds to a local mini-
mum, with all the 30 normal modes being real. However, because of the symmetry, 10
frequencies are doubly degenerate, with a total of 20 single levels. The infrared spec-
trum should be quite simple, with only 3 active modes, namely, the doubly degenerate
level at 2407.9 cm−1, corresponding to the asymmetric stretching of the Si–H bond, the
800.5 cm−1 level, corresponding to the asymmetric bending of the Si–Si–H valence an-
gle, and the 489.9 cm−1 level, corresponding to a composite motion of an out of plane
vibration of the H atoms and of an asymmetric stretching of the Si–Si bonds.

Calculations of electronic energies have then been performed which lead to Fig. 6.
This will now be discussed in some detail. The 6-31G∗ basis set was employed within the
UHF framework.

Starting from the fully optimized structure for the UHF-singlet (a structure very
similar to that of the cyclo-hexane, with a “chair”-like shape), the uniform scaling factor
R/R0 was increased from 0.8 to 1.7. At each step, only the Si–Si distance and one internal
torsional angle were kept constant. This was required in order to allow a closed ring
structure. All the other degrees of freedom (including those of the hydrogen atoms) were
optimized by the calculation. The fully optimized UHF-singlet strcture has been used
also for the UHF-7 calculations, for which the same procedure was employed: ﬁxed Si–Si
distance plus one internal angle, all the rest was left free to be optimized, including the
hydrogen variables. As can be seen from Fig. 6, up to R/R0 = 1.15, the UHF-1 is more
stable than the UHF-7. Such a situation corresponds to having the electrons localized on
each Si p-orbital. From R/R0 = 1.15 on, the UHF-7 structures are more stable than the
corresponding UHF-1, and the energy (correctly) tends to that of 6 SiH radicals, each in
a doublet conﬁguration.

The conclusion is that, in this basis, the π system localizes at a distance equal to
1.2–1.5 times the equilibrium distance. As far as the spin population is concerned, in all
the UHF-1 calculations, the Gaussian program assigns the value 0 to every atom in the
molecule. On the other hand, positive values, with moduli about unity, are found at the
end of each calculation for the UHF-7 conﬁgurations.

5 Summary and future directions

We have here presented a variety of HF calculations for stretched chemical bonds in the,
as yet unsynthesized, molecule Si6H6. The UHF state is lower in energy than the HF
singlet state with uniform scaling of all bonds by a factor λ, throughout the range of λ
investigated in the present work (λ ≃ 0.8 to 2.6), and a non zero spin density is predicted
on Si (and H) nuclei, with alternating sign on neighbouring radicals.

In Sec. 4 above, we have shown that, in contrast of course to benzene, the stable form

17

predicted for Si6H6 at the present level of approximation is a non-planar structure. The
motivation for this was that the planar structure we initially investigated was ‘unstable’
in the sense that not all the vibrational frequencies were real. The ‘buckled’ structure
reported in Sec. 4 has all its vibrational frequencies real.

Also, based on Fig. 6, we have presented evidence that for such a non-planar structure
the π-electron assembly exhibits a tendency to pass from delocalized character at the
equilibrium Si–Si length to localized behaviour when the bonds are stretched, the eﬀect
securing at a distance equal to 1.2 to 1.5 times the equilibrium distance.

Of course, for the future, it remains of considerable interest to see whether Si6H6 can
be successfully synthesized. From solid-state facts, however, Si seems not to ‘like’ sp2 hy-
bridization, there being only diamond structure in the crystalline state, with no analogue
of sp2 bonded graphite layers with C-bonding. Nevertheless, the binding energy we have
predicted relative to 6 SiH radicals is substantial (∼ 1
2 hartree) and we could anticipate,
from our earlier arguments [12] relating electron correlation in bonds to bond order, that
electron correlation would increase this binding energy. This has been supported by the
density functional results of Sec. 5.

Appendix A: Comparison with benzene with stretched bonds

To compare and contrast with the calculations reported in the main text, we summarize
here results on benzene (C6H6) with stretched bonds. Fig. A.1 shows the ground state
energy as a function of uniform scale factor λ. Clearly, the spin density HF solution
rapidly becomes lower in energy than the RHF curve.

The evaluated spin densities on a C atom and on an H atom are shown in Fig. A.2.
One presumes that, quite rapidly, there will be a transition in benzene from ring currents
in the π-system to localized π electrons. Fig. A.3 shows the variation of the average value
of the spin operator S2 with stretching parameter λ.

Some calculations have also been performed with dissociation into 6 independent
CH radicals. The results resemble those reported in Section 3 of the main text for Si6H6.
However, the UHF curve on Fig. A.4 is always below the dissociation limit (compare
with Fig. 2), and the spin population on a CH independent radical is 3 parallel spins (see
Fig. A.5), whereas for a SiH radical one net spin is found to be more stable.

Appendix B: Approximate inclusion of electron correlation: density functional
results

Having established the predictions of the unrestricted Hartree-Fock theory, among
which the most signiﬁcant for comparison with density functional predictions reported
below are (i) a Si–Si bond length in Si6H6 at equilibrium of 2.214 ˚A and (ii) a binding
energy of 0.40 a.u. with respect to SiH radicals, we turn to density functional results as
a means to make an approximate assessment of the eﬀect of electron-electron Coulombic
correlations.

The BLYP (Becke [13], Lee-Yang-Parr [14]) and the B3LYP (Becke [15], Lee-Yang-
Parr [14]) density functional calculations are reported in Table B.1. In contrast to the
Hartree-Fock calculations, where the optimized SiH bond length for the ring was used

18

throughout, the Si–H distance has now been optimized separately for radicals as well as
for the ring. The Si–Si bond length was optimized for the ring while it was constrained
to a planar hexagon geometry.

For B3LYP, the Si–Si equilibrium bond length was found to be very close to the HF
value of 2.214 ˚A, namely 2.215 ˚A. For the BLYP functional, the bond was somewhat
longer (by 0.02 ˚A). The shorter bond length given by the B3LYP functional led to a
somewhat greater binding energy ∆E with respect to the SiH radicals (bound with respect
to atomization). However, both functionals are embraced by ∆E = 0.547 ± 0.005 a.u.,
which exceeds the HF prediction by approximately 4 eV. Correlation inclusion therefore
does not change the essence of the HF results for the molecule Si6H6.

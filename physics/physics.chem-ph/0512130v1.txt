We develop a linear response theory of solvation of ionic and dipolar solutes in anisotropic, axially
symmetric polar solvents. The theory is applied to solvation in polar nematic liquid crystals. The
formal theory constructs the solvation response function from projections of the solvent dipolar sus-
ceptibility on rotational invariants. These projections are obtained from Monte Carlo simulations
of a ﬂuid of dipolar spherocylinders which can exist both in the isotropic and nematic phase. Based
on the properties of the solvent susceptibility from simulations and the formal solution, we have
obtained a formula for the solvation free energy which incorporates experimentally available proper-
ties of nematics and the length of correlation between the dipoles in the liquid crystal. The theory
provides a quantitative framework for analyzing the steady-state and time-resolved optical spectra
and makes several experimentally testable predictions. The equilibrium free energy of solvation is
anisotropic in the nematic phase and is given by a quadratic function of cosine of the angle between
the solute dipole and the solvent nematic director. The sign of solvation anisotropy is determined
by the sign of dielectric anisotropy of the solvent: solvation anisotropy is negative in solvents with
positive dielectric anisotropy and vice versa. The solvation free energy is discontinuous at the point
of isotropic-nematic phase transition. The amplitude of this discontinuity is strongly aﬀected by
the size of the solute becoming less pronounced for larger solutes. The discontinuity itself and the
magnitude of the splitting of the solvation free energy in the nematic phase are mostly aﬀected by
microscopic dipolar correlations in the nematic solvent. Illustrative calculations are presented for
the Stokes shift and Stokes shift correlation function of coumarin-153 in 4-n-pentyl-4’-cyanobiphenyl
(5CB) and 4,4-n-heptyl-cyanopiphenyl (7CB) solvents as a function of temperature in both the ne-
matic and isotropic phase.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of polar solvation is one of the oldest problems of Physical Chemistry which yet is still a ﬁeld of active
theoretical and experimental research. The calculation of solvation free energy is particularly complex, since it is
aﬀected by a variety of contributions including the short-range cavity formation energy, medium-range dispersion and
induction forces (non-polar solvation), and long-range electrostatic interactions (polar solvation). These components
often compensate and complement each other when solvents of diﬀerent polarity are considered. As a result, calcula-
tions of the overall free energy of solvation are challenging and often require phenomenological parametrization. Many
phenomena encountered in chemistry (spectroscopy, redox reactions, etc.) are, however, less aﬀected by the cavitation
free energy than by non-polar and polar solvation, while the latter often dominates in polar solvents. Therefore, much
eﬀort over the last 80 years, following the work of Born,1 Onsager,2 and Kirkwood3 has focused on the understanding
and modeling of electrostatic, polar solvation.

The original Born-Onsager idea of calculating the electrostatic solvation free energy as the continuum dielectric
response to charges of the solute has found broad applications, in particularly to solvation of large molecules often
encountered in bio-medical research.4,5 For smaller solutes, formal liquid-state theories, most notably integral equa-
tion theories, have found broad application. These theories are normally formulated either in terms of site-site6 or
multipolar interaction7 potentials. The proliferation of computer simulation techniques has helped to clarify many
microscopic features of solvation as well as to test and reﬁne the formal models.

Most of the eﬀort in the ﬁeld of solvation thermodynamics has been focused on the understanding of solvation in
isotropic solvents. Anisotropic solvation, important for chemical reactivity in biological membranes, surfaces, and
liquid crystalline solvents, has attracted relatively little attention. Also, from the side of experiment, almost nothing
is known about thermodynamics of solvation in liquid crystals. There is a very limited evidence on the solvatochromic
shift from spectroscopy8 and a few solvation dynamics studies9,10,11 have been reported. Computer experiment on
solvation in liquid crystals virtually does not exist. Continuum models, representing the eﬀect of solvent anisotropy by
a tensorial dielectric constant, have been proposed.12,13 These approaches provide a very useful continuum limit since,

for instance, the Onsager problem of solvation of a spherical dipole2 has an exact analytical solution for continuum
nematics.14,15

Despite the progress in using dielectric continuum models, a few fundamental problems still need to be resolved.
First, limits of the applicability of the continuum approximation to solvation in polar nematics have not been estab-
lished. Liquid crystals are mostly made of bulky elongated molecules, and it is a priori unclear if continuum models
can be applied to solvation of solutes of size often comparable to the size of the solvent molecules. Second, it is not
clear if dielectric response of a liquid crystal to the solute electric ﬁeld can in principle be represented by a single
quantity, the dielectric constant, in particular close to the isotropic-nematic phase transition.

The approach we propose in this paper is based on the recently obtained microscopic solution for dipole solvation.16
The model is based on the assumption that the solute-solvent interaction potential is given by the interaction of
the solute charges with the solvent dipolar polarization. The solvation free energy is then expressed through the
polarization autocorrelation function of the pure solvent without any particular assumptions regarding the solvent
structure. The theory is thus applicable to an arbitrary isotropic dielectric. The goal of this paper is to generalize
this approach to the case of a solvent with axial symmetry. For solvation in isotropic liquids, two projections of
the polarization autocorrelation function, longitudinal and transverse, are suﬃcient to describe the dipolar response.
Lowering the symmetry of the solvent requires a larger set of projections. We derive a formally exact expression for
the free energy of ionic and dipolar solvation in Sec. II [Eq. (46)].

The full formulation of the theory requires projections of the polarization correlation function on rotational invari-
ants. These are obtained here from computer simulations of a ﬂuid of dipolar hard spherocylinders. The application
of the theory to experiment requires, however, a solution based on the input parameters available from experiment.
This formulation is given in Sec. III [Eq. (58)] in form of a linear combination of solutions obtained in the limit of
zero wavenumber (continuum) and inﬁnite wavenumber. The relative contribution of each component depends on the
correlation length of dipolar ﬂuctuations in the liquid (distinct from the correlation length of the order parameter
ﬂuctuations in Landau-de Gennes theory of liquid crystals17). One of the principle results of this study is a very slow
approach of the solvation free energy to its continuum limit, thus invalidating continuum approaches to solvation of
small and medium-size solutes. We study the dependence of the free energy of solvation on the angle between the
solute dipole and nematic director as well as on temperature when crossing the point of isotropic-nematic transition in
Sec. IV. The solvation free energy is shown to pass through a discontinuity at the transition temperature and becomes
anisotropic in the nematic phase. Also, the Stokes shift correlation function changes from a single-exponential decay
in the isotropic phase to bi-exponential decay in the nematic phase. Our results are summarized in Sec. V.

II. THEORY

The linear response approximation (LRA) provides a solution for the solvation free energy (strictly speaking, the
chemical potential) µ in terms of the response function χ(r1, r2) which gives the dipolar polarization in the point of
space r1 produced by the external electric ﬁeld E0(r2) at the point of space r2:

The solute space is made by the van der Waals repulsive cores of its atoms. The radii of the solute atoms exposed to
the solvent are augmented by the shortest distance to the solvent dipole, which, for cylindrically symmetric molecules,

where δ ˜P(

˜k) is the Fourier transform of the ﬂuctuation of the solvent dipolar polarization.

The LRA solution is independent of the electrostatic ﬁeld of the solute and the subscript “0” in the angular brackets
denotes the statistical average taken at the presence of a ﬁctitious solute with the repulsive core of the real solute but
the electrostatic solute-solvent coupling turned oﬀ.16,18 In a hypothetical case of an inﬁnitely small solute, ˜χ˜χ˜χ is equal
to the dipolar susceptibility of pure solvent ˜χ˜χ˜χs which depends on only one wavevector:

˜χ˜χ˜χ(k1, k2) = δk1,k2 ˜χ˜χ˜χs(k1),

where subscript “s” denotes the solvent.

In the general case, ˜χ˜χ˜χ(k1, k2) is aﬀected by the presence of the solute and depends on two k-vectors. The eﬀect
of the solute on solvent response can generally be separated into two major contribution. The repulsive core of the
solute distorts the local density of the solvent around it. The spherically-symmetric solute-solvent pair correlation
function h0s(r) is then diﬀerent from the solvent-solvent pair correlation function hss(r). This density disturbance
aﬀects the dipolar polarization and, consequently, the response function. Another, by far more signiﬁcant, eﬀect of
the solute on the solvent response function is related to the expulsion of the dipolar polarization from the solute
volume. In continuum models, this eﬀect is responsible for the surface charge at the dielectric cavity and, when the
cavity does not coincide with the equipotential surface, results in a transverse component in the dielectric response.
The Maxwell’s dielectric displacement19 D(r) then diﬀers from the external electric ﬁeld E0(r).

The exclusion of the dipolar polarization from the solute volume is accounted for in Chandler’s Gaussian

approximation18,20 resulting in the following equation for the k-space response function16

Here, δk1,k2 = (2π)3δ(k1 −

The substitution of Eq. (7) into Eq. (3) results in the chemical potential of solvation given by the sum of two

µ = µh + µcorr.

The ﬁrst term, µh, corresponds to the homogeneous response approximation (subscript “h”) which assumes that
correlations of dipolar polarization are not modiﬁed by the solute and χχχ(k1, k2) can be approximated by dipolar
susceptibility of the pure solvent according to Eq. (6). The only modiﬁcation introduced by the solute is the cutoﬀ of
the electric ﬁeld inside the solute [Eq. (4)]:

s and transverse ˜χT

In isotropic solvents, the tensor ˜χ˜χ˜χs is diagonal in a coordinate system with one axis taken along k. Its eigenvalues,
the longitudinal ˜χL
s projections, are quite diﬀerent in the range σk < 2π due to the long-range
nature of the dipole-dipole interaction potential (σ is the diameter of the solvent molecules).21 In particular, χT
s (0)
grows as the dielectric constant ǫ in strongly polar solvents, while χL
s (0) tends to a constant value. Because of the
mutual orthogonality of the longitudinal and transverse projections, the homogeneous solvation free energy µh splits
into the longitudinal (L) and transverse (T) parts, each given by a 3D integral in k:

Once the transverse component of the ﬁeld ˜ET
0 (k) is non-zero, which happens when either the solute shape or the
solute electric ﬁeld deviates from spherical symmetry, µT
h grows linearly with the dielectric constant resulting in the
“transverse catastrophe”. Therefore, the homogeneous approximation gives reasonable results only for spherical ions
when the transverse component of dipolar response is eliminated by the symmetry. It is the second term, generally
represented by a 6D integral over the two k-vectors, that corrects (subscript “corr”) for the unphysical behavior of
the transverse response.

The correction component µcorr can be evaluated exactly using analytical properties of the response function when
the electric ﬁeld is known in the analytical form. In case of a dipole solute, the ﬁnal solution is conveniently formulated
in terms of µL,T

(Ref. 16):

h

Unfortunately, this scheme is hard to implement for liquid crystals. Since a liquid crystal has its own symmetry axis
(Fig. 1), ˜χ˜χ˜χs needs to be diagonalized for each value of k making the problem rather complex. Expansion of the solvent
response function in spherical harmonics22,23 appears to be a more straightforward way to the solution. Our solution
below is given for the case of spherical ion (“i”) and spherical dipole (“d”). These two solutes are characterized by
the following expressions for the ﬁeld Fourier transform in Eq. (4)

A. Continuum limit

We use the laboratory Cartesian system of coordinates with z-axis parallel to the nematic director ˆn (Fig. 1).
The continuum limit for solvent response function can be obtained from Maxwell’s material equations with axially
symmetric dielectric constant characterized by longitudinal (ǫk = ǫz) and transverse (ǫ⊥ = ǫx = ǫy) components:24

The ﬁeld F0 deﬁned by Eq. (19) is a generalization of the reaction ﬁeld, introduced by Onsager for a point dipole,2
to an arbitrary conﬁguration of solute charges in a solute of arbitrary shape. We have shown here that this ﬁeld
reduces to expected limits in the case of spherical ionic and dipolar solutes. In the former case, the reaction potential
created by the polar liquid within the cavity is constant, and the reaction ﬁeld is zero. In the latter case, the ﬁeld
is constant and our expression in Eqs. (30)–(32) coincides with the reaction ﬁeld in an axially anisotropic dielectric
previously derived for a spherical dipole by solving the Poisson equation.15

The zero reaction ﬁeld in the case of a spherical ion eliminates the correction term in Eq. (10). This means that
the solvent response is longitudinal and the dielectric displacement D is equal to the external ﬁeld E0. The free
energy of solvation is then fully determined by the homogeneous solvation term [Eq. (11)]. In case of a dipole, the
solvent response includes a transverse component, the dielectric displacement is not equal to the external ﬁeld, and
the correction term is necessary:

III. RESULTS

The theory developed in the previous section requires static dielectric constants and dipolar susceptibility of the
nematic solvent as input. Here we obtain these data from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of hard spherocylinders
with embedded point dipoles.26 This ﬂuid transforms from isotropic to nematic phase with decreasing density.27 NVT
MC simulations of N = 800 hard spherocylinders were carried out in our previous study.26 The dipole moment m is
parallel to the cylinder axis and the aspect ratio of the length L of the cylindrical part of the molecule to its diameter
σ is equal to 5. The thermodynamic state of this ﬂuid is fully deﬁned by two parameters: the reduced dipole moment
(m∗)2 = m2/(kBT σ3) and the packing fraction η = (π/6)ρσ3(1 + 3L/2σ), where ρ = N/V is the solvent number
density. Details of the simulation protocol are given in Ref. 26.

Simulations of nematics with high magnitudes of the dipole moment m∗ are hindered by the tendency of neighboring
dipoles to orient in a locally antiferroelectric order. Combined with the elongated shape of the spherocylinders,
local antiparallel alignment of dipoles creates bottlenecks in the system phase space, which are hard to explore by

9

(49)

(50)

(m∗)2

standard simulation techniques.27 In addition, the ﬂuid of dipolar spherocylinders becomes smectic at (m∗)2 > 6.0
and η = 0.47. Because of the relatively high aspect ratio of the solvent molecules, the dipole moment in the range
0
6.0 gives a relatively small overall density of dipoles and, therefore, a low dielectric constant. As a result,
the capabilities of simple hard-core models are rather limited in exploring high-polarity nematics. The structure of real
polar nematic liquids, which can demonstrate rather high dielectric constants,28 is mostly determined by dispersion
site-site interactions between elongated molecules.

cylinders: l = 0 (solid line), l = 2 (dashed line) and l = 4 (dotted line). The dash-dotted lines refer to the Pad´e approximation
[Eq. (58)] with Λ = 0.4σ. The structure factors are obtained from NVT MC simulations26 of 800 solvent molecules with the
packing density η = 0.47 and the dipole moment m2/(kBT σ3) = 1.0. The ﬂuid is in the nematic phase with the nematic order
parameter S2 = 0.85.

For weakly polar nematics, the tensor of the dipolar susceptibility ˜χ˜χ˜χs is nearly diagonal in the Cartesian coordinate
system speciﬁed in Fig. 1, with almost equal xx and yy projections. Therefore, the formally exact formulas in Eq. (42)
can be replaced by the approximate relation in Eq. (46). The solvation free energy then depends on six one-dimensional
projection χs,ααl(k) [Eq. (48)]. The corresponding structure factors of dipolar polarization

have been obtained here from equilibrium MC conﬁgurations of the ﬂuid of dipolar spherocylinders (Fig. 2).26 In Eq.
(49),

Sαα,l(k) = (4π/3y)χs,αβl(k)

y = 4πm2ρ/(9kBT )

is the standard dipole density parameter of dielectric theories.19 The reduced dipole moment and the packing fraction
of the system have values (m∗)2 = 1 and η = 0.47 (the isotropic-nematic phase transition occurs at ηIN ≈
0.407). In
this thermodynamic state, the nematic order parameter S2 is equals to 0.85, and the longitudinal (ǫk, parallel to the
director) and transverse (ǫ⊥, perpendicular to the director) dielectric constants are 1.89 and 1.06, respectively.

The noise in the structure factors obtained from simulations (Fig. 2) arises from the ﬂuctuations of the nematic
director in the laboratory system of coordinates attached to the simulation box. This setup is necessary to insure that
the wavevectors used to calculate Sαα,l(k) are eigenvectors of the periodic replicas of the cubic simulation cell. The
calculations show that the longitudinal structure factors (Szz,l) are signiﬁcantly larger than the transverse structure
factors (Sxx,l), as expected for nematics with longitudinal dipolar moment. In addition, the magnitudes of projections
decrease rapidly with increasing index l.

Exact analytical expressions are available for the polarization structure factors in k

limits. The
continuum limit relates Szz,l(0) and Sxx,l(0) to the anisotropic static dielectric constants through Eqs. (22), (48), and
limit, we note that the Cartesian components of the dipolar structure factors are given

The continuum [k = 0, Eqs. (35) and (36)] and short wave-length [k

asymptotes for the solvation free energy obtained by setting, respectively, the constant χχχs(0) and χχχs(
) values for
the solvent susceptibility in the k-integrals in Eqs. (11) and (33). The advantage of these limiting expressions is their
simplicity and direct connection to experimentally available properties of liquid crystalline solvents. These limits can
be used to derive a practically useful analytical formula for µ. The largest contribution to µ comes from the region
of k where the squared spherical Bessel functions jl(kR1) in Eq. (46) has a maximum. This is the region around
2/R1 for the dipolar solute. We need, therefore, a continuous approximation for

This formula introduces a new theory parameter, the polarization correlation length Λl. The correlation length can
be extracted from structure factors obtained from computer simulations by ﬁtting the slope of Sαβ,l(k) vs k2 to the
k
2/σ). Values of Λl for the ﬂuid of dipolar hard spherocylinders depending
on packing fraction η and dipolar density y are shown in Fig. 3 (closed points). Λl was found to be rather weakly
dependent on η, even through the isotropic-nematic phase transition (Fig. 3, upper panel). The dependence on y was
obtained at ﬁxed packing fraction η = 0.432 and (m∗)2 changing from 1.0 to 6.0.

We compare these results to the correlation lengths extracted from slopes of the longitudinal structure factor SL(k)
vs k2 and the inverse structure factor 1/ST (k) vs k2. The latter deﬁnition corresponds to the Ornstein-Zernike-Debye
plot used for the scattering function of liquids close to the critical temperature when the structure factor is a decaying
function of k.29 On the contrary, the longitudinal structure factor is a rising function of k requiring the direct expansion
of SL(k) in k2. The correlation lengths for longitudinal and transverse dipolar ﬂuctuations in isotropic liquids are
substantially diﬀerent. This is because these two projections mix together harmonics of the pair distribution function

In contrast to longitudinal and transverse projections of isotropic ﬂuids, the projections Sαβ,l(k) correspond to
the same index l. The anisotropy of the nematic phase relative to the director is then taken out to the Legendre
polynomial Pl(cos θk) [Eq. (48)]. In addition, we found that Λl calculated from diﬀerent harmonics with the same l
are approximately equal to each other, at least for weak polar solvents. This is why Λl in Eq. (56) does not include
Cartesian projections α, β. The results for l = 0 are presented in Fig. 5, while data for l > 0 do not converge well
because of large statistical errors.

Non-locality functions f (i)(R1/Λ) and f (d)(R1/Λ) decay monotonically from one to zero with increasing the solute
size R1 (Fig. 4). The ionic non-locality function decays faster than the dipolar function indicating that ionic solvation
is better described by continuum approximation than is dipolar solvation. Notice that formula (58) applies to solvation
in strongly polar nematics, because it has been derived without assuming weak polarity of the solvent (the cross-terms
omitted in Eq. (46) are included in µc). Figure 5 demonstrates a satisfactory agreement between the approximate
solution given by Eq. (58) and the exact microscopic theory [Eqs. (46)–(48)]. The increase of the solvent dipole
moment leads to an oscillatory character of the response function, but even in this case, the Pad´e approximation [Eq.
(56)] gives reasonably accurate estimates for the solvation free energy in isotropic polar solvents.30

Equation (58), combining the limiting continuum and high wavevector values for ionic [Eqs. (35) and (54)] and
dipolar [Eqs. (36) and (55)] solutes, is the central results of this study. The solvation free energy requires the following
solvent parameters: dielectric constants ǫk and ǫ⊥, the order parameter S2, the polarization correlation length Λ. In
addition, the ionic charge or dipole moment, along with the radius R1 = R0 + σ/2, should be supplied. The dielectric
constants and the order parameter come from experiment. The correlation length Λ is not experimentally available
and, for the sake of interpreting the experiment, is, at the moment, a theory parameter requiring ﬁtting to some
experimental observable. Simulations of the model ﬂuid of hard spherocylinders suggest magnitudes of Λ of the order

IV. THEORY PREDICTIONS

The present theory allows us to make some speciﬁc predictions regarding equilibrium solvation and solvation dy-
namics. The electrostatic component of solvation free energy can be measured from the steady-state Stokes shift of
optical lines, whereas solvation dynamics is probed by the Stokes shift correlation function. Our discussion below will
therefore target these two properties.

A. Equilibrium solvation

Our present development highlights several issues important for the understanding of equilibrium solvation in
axially-symmetric solvents: (1) Solvation anisotropy, i.e. the dependence of the free energy of solvation on the orien-
tation of the solute dipole relative to nematic director. (2) The eﬀect of crossing the phase transition temperature on
the solvation thermodynamics. (3) The eﬀect of dipolar correlations on solvation and the applicability of continuum
models of solvation.

From Eqs. (36), (55), and (58), the solvation free energy of a dipole, µ(d), is a quadratic function of cos θ0, where
θ0 is the angle between the solute dipole and nematic director (Fig. 1). Figure 6 shows that the solvation anisotropy

is negative in nematics with positive dielectric anisotropy (∆ǫ = ǫk −
0) and µ(d)
∆ǫ:

k = µ(d)(θ0 =
⊥ = µ(d)(θ0 = π/2)). This can readily be veriﬁed by expanding Eq. (36) in powers of the small parameter

The signiﬁcant eﬀect of dipolar correlations on the solvation thermodynamics is seen from comparison of lower
and upper panels in Fig. 7 which shows steady-state Stokes shift of coumarin-153 dissolved in 4-n-pentyl-4′-
cyanobiphenyl (5CB) nematogen. This chromophore is widely used as a spectroscopic probe of solvation dynamics
and thermodynamics.32,33 Stokes shift dynamics of coumarin-153 in the isotropic phase of a liquid crystalline solvent11
and of coumarin-5039,10 in both isotropic and nematic phases have been reported. The continuum limit in the lower
panel reveals a much weaker anisotropy in the nematic phase than the full microscopic calculation in the upper panel.
The continuum calculations are also much lower in the absolute magnitude, which is normally oﬀ-set by choosing the
radius R0 instead of the closest approach distance R1 (Fig. 7, dash-dotted line). However, for the present calculation,
re-scaling the cavity radius does not fully recover the solvation energy. This result suggests that polar nematics might
produce stronger solvation than isotropic solvents with a comparable dielectric constant.

The electrostatic ﬁeld of coumarin-153 is similar to that of a point dipole,34 which makes it a convenient system to
test our theory. Since the Stokes shift experiments measure only nuclear solvation, the Stokes shift hc∆¯νst (¯ν is the
wavenumber, cm−1) was calculated according to the following expression

hc∆¯νst =

2µ(d)

n (m0 = ∆m0).

Here, the diﬀerence in the dipole moments in the excited and ground states of the chromophore ∆m0 is substituted
for the solute dipole moment. The nuclear component of solvation is calculated in the additive approximation35 in
which the overall solvation free energy in a polar/polarizable liquid is assumed to be the sum of the nuclear and
electronic solvation components. The overall solvation free energy µ(ǫk, ǫ⊥, yeﬀ) is calculated from the anisotropic
dielectric constant in the component µc(ǫk, ǫ⊥) and the eﬀective dipolar density yeﬀ in µ∞(yeﬀ). The eﬀective dipolar
density is deﬁned as36

where α is the dipolar polarizability and m′ is the average dipole moment of the solvent in the liquid. The nuclear
free energy of solvation is then given by

5CB was chosen as a typical nematogen with its physical properties well documented in the literature: the isotropic-
nematic transition temperature, TIN = 308.2 K38, dipole moment, m = 4.75 D,39 and the azimuthal angle between the
dipole moment and the long axis, β = 21.60.40 The temperature dependences of the static dielectric constants,39,40
refraction indexes,39,41 the order parameter,41 and density39 have also been reported. For the solvent diameter the
value for benzene, σ = 5.27 ˚A,37 was adopted, and the polarization correlation length was calculated from Fig. 3 as
3.6. The dipole moment m′ was calculated using the Onsager approximation
Λ = 0.35σ corresponding to (m∗)2 = 3.3

where ǫs is given by Eq. (62) and n2 = (n2

k + 2n2

⊥)/3.

Note that this approximation is made in the Maier-Meier theory [Eq. (63)] which, nevertheless, describes dielectric
properties of polar nematics reasonably well.42,43 All results in Fig. 7 have been obtained at experimentally documented
parameters of 5CB, the gap between the Stokes shift curves around the isotropic-nematic transition temperature
reﬂects the absence of experimental data in this temperature range.

The dynamics of solvation following the photoinduced change in the solute charge distribution is recorded by

measuring the Stokes shift correlation function44

within the linear response theory. Several formulations of the theory are available in the literature,45,46,47 and we
adopt here the formulation due to Wolynes45 which represents the Laplace transform E(s) of the time-dependent
function E(t) as the equilibrium solvation energy characterized by the dielectric constant ǫ(s)

The dependence of Λ on the dielectric constant of a nematic solvent is generally unknown. We will therefore assume
this parameter independent of the Laplace variable s. Within this approximation, the Stokes shift function is fully
determined by the continuum expression for the solvation energy [Eq. (36)]. The results for S(t) presented here are
therefore based on the continuum solution for the dipolar solvation energy in an anisotropic dielectric with axial
symmetry.

rotation around a long molecular axis (relaxation time τ2) and low-frequency rotation around a short molecular axis
(relaxation time τ1).38 In isotropic phase, τ2iso is about ten times smaller that τ1iso, and the contribution from high-
frequency rotation to dielectric loss is usually small and is rarely resolved in the dielectric experiments.28,38 With
only one relaxation time τ1iso, Eq. (72) reduces to the Debye dispersion resulting in a single-exponential Stokes shift
correlation function with the relaxation time τS = [(2ǫ∞ + 1)/(2ǫ0 + 1)]τ1iso (Ref. 47).

The liquid crystalline order of the nematic phase hinders rotations around a short molecular axis when it is per-
pendicular to the nematic director. The corresponding relaxation time τ1k is about ten times larger than τ1iso. In
contrary, τ1⊥ is much smaller than τ1iso, and can be comparable to τ2a (a =

Two predictions follow from our calculations in the nematic phase. First, S(t) is bi-exponential. The slow component
with τS1 ≈
2 ns and
1.2 is related to the relaxation of ǫ⊥. Second, S(t) is eﬀected by the angle θ0 between the solute dipole and the
γ2 ≈
nematic director. For nematics with positive dielectric anisotropy (e.g., 7CB) S(t) decays faster for θ0 = 900 than
for θ0 = 00. Note that the slow component has not been detected in experimental studies of transient Stokes shift in
nematics,9,10,11 probably because of the limited experimental time resolution (a few ns). All Stokes shift relaxation
times monotonically increase with lowering temperature in both the nematic and isotropic phase (Fig. 9).

V. CONCLUSIONS

This article presents a microscopic theory of solvation in solvents with axial symmetry. Although applications of
the theory considered here are limited to nematic liquid crystals, i.e. liquids with inversion symmetry of the polar axis,
the formalism is also applicable to ferroelectric solvents with a preferential polar direction. This conclusion follows
from the fact that the linear response approximation leads to a quadratic dependence on the solute dipole moment
invariant to the dipole ﬂip. For ferroelectrics, however, the solvation energy gains an additional contribution, linear
in the solute dipole, from the macroscopic polarization of the solvent.

The full microscopic formulation requires k-dependent dipolar susceptibility of the nematic solvent which needs
to be obtained from computer experiment. From the analysis of the results of MC simulations and the microscopic
formalism, we have derived a formula for the solvation chemical potential which is based on experimentally measurable
input parameters and a theory parameter, the length of dipolar correlations in the solvent. This correlation length was
obtained from MC simulations in the range of parameters attainable for the model ﬂuid of dipolar spherocylinders.
The understanding of the properties of the correlation length in a broader range of parameters, in particular for higher
dielectric constants, will require simulations of nematogenes with more realistic intermolecular potentials.

The theory provides a quantitative framework for interpreting the spectroscopic steady-state and time-resolved
experiments and makes several experimnetally testable predictions. We show that the equilibrium free energy in the
nematic phase is a quadratic function of cosine of the angle between the solute dipole and the solvent nematic director.
The sign of solvation anisotropy is determined by the sign of dielectric anisotropy of the solvent: solvation anisotropy
is negative in solvents with positive dielectric anisotropy and vice versa. The solvation free energy is discontinuous
at the point of isotropic-nematic transition. The amplitude of this discontinuity is strongly aﬀected by the size of
the solute becoming less pronounced for larger solutes. The discontinuity itself and the magnitude of the splitting of
the solvation chemical potential in the nematic phase are mostly aﬀected by microscopic dipolar correlations in the
nematic solvent.

The Stokes shift correlation function in the isotropic phase is one-exponential when dielectric relaxation is given by
the Debye form. The corresponding relaxation time is a smooth function of temperature through isotropic-nematic
transition. In the nematic phase, the Stokes shift relaxation becomes bi-exponential with a much slower relaxation
component related to rotations of polar molecules around their short axes in the nematic potential strongly hindering
such motions.

with asymptotes 1/r3. Assuming that only the 1/r3 asymptotes contribute to ˜χ′(k = 0), we arrive in Eq. (A5) from
Eq. (A4) and orthogonality of spherical harmonics.

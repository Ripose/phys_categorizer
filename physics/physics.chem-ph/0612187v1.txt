Abstract

The four center integrals needed in the Hartree Fock approximation and in TDDFT linear response are known to be
diﬃcult to calculate for orbitals of the Slater type or of ﬁnite range. We show that the interaction of pairs of products
that do not mutually intersect may be replaced by the interaction of their moments, of which there are O(N). Only
quadruplets of orbitals ’close’ to one another need an explicit calculation and the total calculational eﬀort therefore
scales as O(N). We provide a new and concise proof of this ”interaction by moments” property.

Motivation

This note is motivated by the occurrence of four center integrals in the TDDFT linear response equation [1], [2]

A technique for calculating these quantities in terms of two center integrals was developed in [3]. In an alternative
”resolution of identity” method, products of orbitals are replaced by auxiliary functions, see [4], [5].

For orbitals of ﬁnite range, there are, for N atoms, O(N 2) pairs (12), (34) of individually intersecting orbitals
suggesting the need of O(N 2) distinct calculations. Here we show that only the subset of < 12
34 > where a pair
|
(1, 2) intersects with a pair (3, 4) must be calculated explicitly, while the remaining ones can be taken into account
by their multipolar interactions. Since there are only O(N ) such quadruplets of orbitals and because the eﬀort of
calculating the moments scales like N , the cost of calculating four center integrals then scales as O(N ).

The present note arose in an ongoing eﬀort to implement linear response for extended molecular systems, an
eﬀort prompted by recent work [7]. We prove and exploit an observation of Greengard on the exact character of the
”interaction by moments”. This observation was rederived previously in the literature [6] and its consequence has
recently been absorbed in a corresponding computer code [8], but our concise and simple deduction of this important
property may still be of interest.

Reduction from four centers to two centers

We ﬁrst need a reduction of products of orbitals to a set of single center functions. Following the discussion of [3] we
obtain an expansion in spherical harmonics of a translated function f (−→r

where Gl1m1,l2m2l3m3 are Gaunt coeﬃcients for the overlap of three spherical harmonics. To bring this approach into
perspective, it is interesting to consider an orbital with a cusp singularity such as e−r and to study the convergence of
the translated orbital towards a translated cusp with increasing angular momentum cutoﬀ jmax, see the ﬁgure. The
ﬁgure shows that a fairly large number of angular harmonics is required for the representation of orbitals having such
a cusp.

By applying translations to two overlapping orbitals we may obtain an expansion of their product about a common

Using such expressions we can compute the Coulomb interaction of two pairs of mutually overlapping orbitals from
the point of view of their associated eﬀective centers.

Exact interaction by moments of non intersecting centers

We have seen that pairs of orbitals may be replaced by eﬀective centers. Now we wish to show that the interaction
between eﬀective centers may be simpliﬁed when their spheres of support no longer intersect. We begin by quoting
formulas for the computation of two center integrals in Fourier space, see [3], [10]

The Coulomb interaction coeﬃcients Cl1,l2,l would reduce to Il1,l2,l (r1, r2, R) if the original orbitals functions were
concentrated at, respectively, radii r1 and r2. This integral therefore represents the Coulomb interaction of two
charged hollow shells of radii r1, r2 at a distance of R, and with the charge densities having the appropriate multipolar
angular dependences. For R > r1 + r2 where these shells no longer intersect, we expect their interaction to simplify.
Because of the Gaunt coeﬃcients in eq(9) we only need this interaction for even values of l1 + l2 + l and where a
triangle inequality
l1 + l2 holds. In this case the integrand associated with the dp integration in eq(10)
is symmetric as a function of p and we may therefore extend the domain of integration to the entire p axis:

It is convenient to use jl(z) = Re hl(z) and to consider a corresponding complex integral I c
that involves the Hankel function hl(z) :

Clearly, the exponential factor eiRpfrom jl(Rp) dominates, for R > r1 + r2, the factors e±ipr1 e±ipr2 that arise in the
integrand in eq(12) from the product jn1 (r1p)jn2 (r2p). Since the integrand in I c
l1,l2,l is analytic, except for possible
singularities at p = 0 and since the contour of integration can be closed in the upper half plane, a non zero contribution
to I c

l1,l2,l can only be due to a residue at p = 0. From eq(13) the most singular term in hl(Rp) at p = 0 is

l attains the maximal value permitted by the triangle inequality, l = l1 + l2. When setting l = l1 + l2 and closing the

Conclusion

We conclude that only the subset of four center integrals < 12
34 > of ”close” pairs where (1, 2) intersects (3, 4) must
|
be calculated explicitly. Because there are only O(N ) such pairs of orbitals for a system of N atoms and because the
multipoles are associated with only O(N ) products, the calculational eﬀort scales as O(N ).

The conclusion that Coulomb integrals should be divided into far and near ﬁeld ones has already been incorporated
in a quantum chemistry code [8]. But our derivation of the ”interaction by moments property” of four center integrals
from a plain integral of a product of three spherical Bessel functions is the simplest and most concise proof of this
property that is available.

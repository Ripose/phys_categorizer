Abstract

A new model for the intermediate compound of the hydrogen evo-
lution reaction (HER) is proposed, for the electrochemical reduction
of hydrogen in the presence of bisulfate on platinum(111). The forma-
tion of this compound, a regular 2 dimensional honeycomb ice lattice,
occurs by a ﬁrst order phase transitions that involves the reorienta-
tion of water molecules. The model is analyzed using new and simple
eﬀective cluster approach which highlights the relevant transitions in
system. This method is based on the cluster variation method used
successfully in our previous work on the UPD of Cu onto Au(111), and
permits us to explore a large region of parameter space, an essential
feature to study this complex system. The theory makes full use of
the properties of the diﬀuse layer: The water molecule is reoriented
as the potential is changed. For positive potentials it forms linear
√7 structure of the sul-
chains which are responsible for the √3
fate observed by STM. At negative potentials water turns so that its
dipole points towards the Pt. Then it will form a regular honeycomb
network of hydrogen bonded molecules, with the sulfate at the center
of the hexagons. Then the bisulfate is desorbed, leaving the honey-
comb HER structure behind. Our model thus provides an explanation
of the well known fact that only 2/3 of the Pt atoms participate in
the electroreduction of the hydrogen. The theory implies geometrical
constraints to the water potential: It should

×

be of tetrahedral coordination.

•

•

be analytical to be able to include the double layer eﬀects, the

ions and external ﬁelds, in the calculations.

•

The angular part of the potential must be relatively soft, since
the angle O-H-O of the hydrogen bond will be bent to keep the water
near the metal surface.
The analytical tetrahedral Yukagua model of water satisﬁes all of these
requirements.

Introduction

The underpotential deposition of hydrogen on platinum(111) in aqueous sul-
furic acid was studied by Clavilier et al. using his pioneering techniques of
preparing monocrystalline electrode surfaces[1, 2].

In Fig.1 1 we show a recent voltammogram for this system obtained by
V. Climent [3] on a rather perfect single crystal. For our discussion we will
divide this voltammogram in three regions:

1. The H-UPD region: A new structure of the HER intermediate is pro-
posed, which explains the observed 2/3 of a monolayer yield for this
surface.

2. the CP butterﬂy region: Here there are two distinct features, a sharp
√3 lattice of

spike, which we identify with the formation of a √3
water-like molecules, with its dipole pointing up.

×

3. the positive region: In this region the √3

√7 structure is formed by

’polywater’ chains of water molecules with its dipole pointing down

×

We note that these steps are similar to the ones proposed by us for the

UPD of Cu/Au(111)[4, 5, 6]: In reverse order:

•

•

•

Region 3: The formation of stacked, elongated hexagonal structures
corresponding [7, 8, 9] to water-bisulfate coadsorption is explained by
the formation of a hydrogen bonded water chain[10, 11]. There is no
phase transition in this case.

Region 2: The spike here is due to the co-adsorption of bisulfate and wa-
ter, forming in fact the same honeycomb structure as in the Cu/Au(111)
case. Now the sulfate simply leaves an empty site, while in the copper
case it was replaced by a copper via a phase transition.

Region 1: In this region the transition is diﬀerent because as the sulfate
is desorbed, its site was ﬁlled by another atom of copper. In our present
case, the hydrogen bond of the hexagons are saturated, and the sulfate
is simply desorbed.

In section 2 we outline the basic formalism and our method of computing
the fugacities of our active compounds. In section 3 we discuss the positive

2

3

Region 3 of the voltammogram. In section 4 we present our model for the
CP butterﬂy region, and ﬁnally in section 5 we discuss our model HER in-
termediate. In the ﬁnal section we compare our resulting voltammogram to
experiment.

2 BASIC FORMALISM

We use a microsopic model, based on the sticky site model (SSM) [12, 13, 14],
in which the exact hamiltonian of the entire interface is projected onto an
equivalent ’electrode’ surface lattice: This means that all solvation and dou-
ble layer eﬀects are included. For example, for dilute solutions such as the
one of our present example the Gouy-Chapman approximation is quite ac-
curate, as has been shown in previous work [6].

One of the problems in surface electrochemistry is the complexity of even
seemingly simple systems, like the one of this paper. Even with modern day
resources it is very diﬃcult, if not outright impossible, to explore the pa-
rameter space of this problem by computer simulation. For this reason we
have used the ’Cluster Variation Method (CVM)[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] to
calculate the adsorption isotherms and generated a voltammogram for the
deposition of H on Pt(111) in the presence of 0.1 M aqueous sulfuric acid.
In our our previous work on the UPD of Cu on Au(111)[6, 4, 5, 20] we used
the ”cluster approximation”[20]. This method successfully predicted the lo-
cal structure and transformations of the voltage dependent phases that were
later observed. For the UPD of hydrogen and the bisulfate anion we use ﬁrst
a simpliﬁed version of this method, the PCVM ( PADE-CVM) approxima-
tion which further simpliﬁes the calculations. This work will be described in
a separate paper [21] In our present work we will use a still simpler theory
that we call the assymptotic cluster model (ACM), where the behavior of the
model is described by a few assymptotically large diagrams which determine
its transitions. The interaction parameters are obtained from theory or sim-
ulation.

The adsorption of species i on the platinum surface primarily depend on
the activities of these adsorbates and the lateral interactions existing between
them[12, 13, 14]. The activity of a species i is given by the product between a

4

sticky parameter λi(ψ) and the species contact density at the surface ρ◦
as

i (0, ψ),

zi = λi(ψ)ρ◦

(1)
The sticky parameter λi(ψ) is a phenomenological parameter characterizing
the quantum mechanical interaction between the adsorbate and surface, and
will in general, be potential dependent. We write [20]

i (0, ψ) .

λi(ψ) = e−βκiζie(ψ−ψref ) ,
(2)
where e is the elementary charge, ζi is the partial charge of the adsorbate
at the surface, and κi is a binding constant characterizing the overlap of
electron orbitals between the adsorbate and surface atoms. The potential
dependence of the contact density is given to a very good approximation by
the Gouy-Chapman expression

i (0, ψ) = ρ◦
ρ◦

i (0, 0)e−νieβ(ψ−ψpzc) ,
i (0, ψpzc) is the density at a smooth (i.e. without sticky sites) surface[14]

where ρ◦
with a potential of zero charge, and νi is the ionic charge of the adsorbate.
It has been veriﬁed in previous work [6] that for our relatively dilute concen-
trations of sulfate ions this is a quite good approximation.

(3)

The potential dependence of the activity zi is then found to be

zi = λi(0)ρ◦
where γi = νi + κiζi is an eﬀective electrovalence of species i.

i (0, 0)e−βγie(ψ−ψ0) ,

(4)

We obtain analytical expressions representing clusters of interacting ad-
sorbates which are used to calculate the coverages of hydrogen and the bisul-
fate anion as a function of potential. The crucial parameters in our present
theory are the water orientation and the bisulfate adsorption.

2.1 THE ADSORPTION AND ORIENTATION OF

WATER AND (BI)SULFATE

We discuss ﬁrst the potential dependent adsorption fugacities of bisulfate
and water. In our model water is adsorbed on the atop position when its
dipole is pointing down and in the hollow site when the dipole is up.

S is the electrosorption reference potential,
that depends on the nature of the substrate. The sticking coeﬃcient can be
interpreted as λS(ψ) = exp [βµS], with µS as the free energy change that
occurs when a bisulfate ion binds to the metal surface. ρ0
S(0, ψ) is the inner
layer local density of bisulfate for a local potential ψ, which is estimated from
the Gouy-Chapman formula.

2.1.2 WATER

For positive electrodes only the oxygen of the water molecule binds to the
electrode metal atoms, since the strong electric ﬁeld E will orient the large
dipole µW of the water molecule. The preferred position at positive potential
bias is that of an inverted tripod, with two of the hydrogens pointing upwards.
The adsorption fugacity of the ’oriented’ water can be written as

shown in Fig.3(2.1.2).

This procedure will be extended to include the full Yukagua model [25]
in the future. We do not expect however large diﬀerences since the main
term in the re-orientation hamiltonian is the dipolar one, and the predicted
capacitance for region 3, obtained from this model agrees reasonably well
with experiment. The chain structure is shown in Fig.4(2.1.2).

3 REGION 3: THE WATER CHAIN RE-

GION

×

The STM structures seen in these systems in the positive end of the voltam-
mogram by various authors [26, 27, 28], consists of elongated √3
√7
hexagons rather than regular hexagons. The elongated structures correspond
to water coadsorption as was shown by Ito. More recent high resolution
STM experiments [8, 9] have been interpreted as being the result of hydro-
gen bonded water chains. However, the structures that are proposed are
unstable in the presence of the high ﬁeld gradients [29] of the electric double
layer, since the dipoles are alternated in order to keep the hydrogen bond
straight. A diﬀerent model is proposed in this paper in which all dipoles
are polarized the same way. However this requires bending of the hydrogen
bond. Our point here is that this is actually the case, even in normal ice
Ih [30], and very clearly in liquid water [25]. This model also explains why
when the polarity is changed, those chains no longer exist and the regular
√3
√3 hexagons are observed [4, 6]. The details of this model, as well as
its consequences will be discussed in a separate paper [10, 11]

×

The formation of water hydrogen bonded chains occurs because the prop-
erly oriented water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the lone pair and
one of the two hydrogens of the ’upper’ plane. In principle any of the two
can form the next bond, and therefore the ’water chain’ chain will consist
of units forming an angle of 142o to 152o instead of the straight 180o, and
the ’free’ hydrogen will be pointing to either side of the chain. If consecutive
free hydrogens point to opposite sides of the chain, then the space between
next nearest neighbors can be occupied by a (bi)sulfate ion. If the nearest
neighbors free hydrogens point to the same side, then the chain will bend,
and there will be a steric hindrance for the (bi)sulfate ion in the neighboring

10

11

site. The model can be mapped into an equivalent one dimensional polymer
with internal degrees of freedom. As such no ﬁrst order transition occurs in
the formation of these chains of elongatged hexagons. A detailed discussion
of this model is left for a future publication[11].

3.1 Contribution to the voltammogram

The main contributor to the current is the capacitive current due to the
ﬂipping of the water molecules, which is computed from the orientational
fugacity Eqs.(1,16)using a Langmiur type equation

where α is a constant that determines the position of the maximum of the
voltammogram in region 3, and has been adjusted for the time being. The
change in the orientation of the water molecules will produce a change in the
capacitive current.

4 REGION 2: THE CP BUTTERFLY

The classic shape of the cyclic voltammogram of the hydrogen UPD on a
platinum single crystal with (111) orientation has been likened to the silhou-
ette of a butterﬂy, hence this particular CV proﬁle is known as Clavilier’s
papillon(CP)[1]. This system has been studied experimentally by a large
number of authors[2, 33, 34, 26, 27, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]

The main point of our theory is the formation of an hexagonal two di-
mensional honeycomb two dimensional ’ice’ structure ( the HER( Hydrogen
Evolution Intermediate) structure shown in Fig.5(4) that remains in place

12

after the desorption of the bisulfate ion. The spike of the Clavilier papillon
(CP, region 2)corresponds to the formation of an ordered, √3

mensurate phase

This is shown in Fig.5 The ’wing’ of the CP [42, 43, 44]is associated with the
desorption of (bi)sulfate, and corresponds also in our theory to the desorption
of the bisulfate. However in our case the HER intermediate, the water-
hydronium honeycomb (WHH)lattice stays intact, and is well represented
by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm. This desorption mechanism is diﬀerent
from the hard hexagon order-disorder transition, recently proposed by Koper
et al. [45], since in their case the desorption produces necessarily a disordered
lattice.

The CO displacement experiments of Feliu and co-workers [46, 47] show
very clearly that the 1/3 corresponding to the ’wing’ of the butterﬂy is capac-
itive and is due to the desorption of the bisulfate, which is what we propose
in our theory.
The detailed PCVM treatment will be published elsewhere [21]. Some high-
lights are:

•

Input parameters are the fugacity of ’up’ water (W), the fugacity of
’up’ hydronium (H) and of the sulfate (S). However the formation of
the honeycomb structure requires an equimolecular mixture of W and
H, so that for the cluster theory we only need an eﬀective adsorbate,
which is one half of the W-H compound, the semi-hydronium (SH). In
our model the assymptotic occupancy is 1/3 of W, 1/3 of H, or 2/3 for
the SH complex, but the eﬀective charge of the SH complex is only 1/2

•

the relevant parameters are the S-S interactions, the SH-SH=W-H in-
teractions and the SH-S interactions.

The result of the CVM are a series of sharp and soft transitions[20]. In our
case there is only one sharp transition, which corresponds the co-adsorption
of bisulfate and hydronium and presumably, also the reorientation of water.
The adsorption isotherms are represented by smoothened step functions:

The positions and widths of the transitions are treated as adjustable pa-
rameters, which however correspond the well deﬁned physical parameters:
∆SH = 40 is the semihydronium transition width;
ψSH = 0.5041 is the position of the semihydronium transition, which occurs
when there is simulataneous co-adsorption of bisulfate and semihydronium.
∆S = 12 is the sulfate;
ψS = 0.44 is the position of the sulfate transition, which is determined by
the bisulfate-bisulfate repulsive interaction.
The bisulfate goes from a coverage of 1/5 to 1/3 , and the semihydronium
from 0 to 2/3. The exact values for the bisulfate coverages will depend on
the other interaction parameters, and will be discussed in a more detailed
PCVM analysis. The coverages for the semihydronium are ﬁxed by the ex-
perimental hydrogen yield. The results of the treatment for the adsorption
isotherms are shown in Figs. 6(4) and 7(4). The agreement with the recent
work of Kolics and Wieckowski[44] is qualitative: First the systems are not
exactly the same, and in our case we predict a small glitch when the sul-
fate is re-adsorbed. We remark also that it is very likely that bisulfate and
perchlorate co-adsorb 1 , since they are isostructural and isoelectronic. This
point will be discussed in the future.

5 THE UPD REGION 1: THE MODEL FOR

THE HER INTERMEDIATE

Region 1, which is called the H-UPD region [48]has been explored experimen-
tally [49, 35], and several proposals have been made for the HER intermediate
[50], based on interpretations of the IR spectra. Our model is based on the
stochiometry and the analysis of the phases of the voltammogram, the STM
1 Pechlorate is tetrahedral, the bond length is 1.325 ˚A in the crystal. Bisulfate cannot
be measured experimentally.The in vacuum structure has been calculated using state of
the art DFT by S. Gaurei, is a slightly distorted tetrahedron with a S-O distance of 1.43
˚A. The major diﬀerence appears to be the dipole moment, which is zero for perchlorate
and 3.80 D for bisulfate

17

experiments and the recent radiotracer adsorption experiments, and is con-
sistent with the experiment described by Peremans et al [35] Our HER model
is a hydrogen bonded network of hexagonal rings, wwhich is a form of two
dimensional ice. The chemical formula for a species is

[(H5O2)+]3

(22)

(23)

which forms a network of hexagonal rings. The explicit reaction taking place
at the (111) face of the electrode is

[(H5O2)+]3 + 6e− = 3H2 + 3H2O + 3HO−

where the 6 hydrogen ions that are neutralized are those ’trapped’ in the hol-
low sites of the Pt(111) surface. This means that the spectra observed in the
H3/2
SFG experiments of Tadjeddine are likey to correspond to P t3 −
(semi-hydronium) complexes. The ’upd’ hydrogen is really a ’semihydro-
nium’ ion, with the hydrogen stuck in the hollow site of the platinum lattice,
and the dipole of the water molecule properly oriented. Recent quantum
mechanical DFT calculations support this model [51].

We assume that a ’surface state’ is formed by the HER inermediate that

Diﬀusion Coeﬃcients for Lysozyme

Na2SO4

Abstract

This paper presents a diﬀusion experimental study for ternary lysozyme-
Na2SO4-water system, from moderate precipitant concentrations into
the supersaturated region and provides a complete set of four diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients. These data are important in order to provide accu-
rate models of protein diﬀusion with applications in growth of protein
crystals for X-ray diﬀraction studies. All three-component mutual-
diﬀusion experiments reported here were performed by Rayleigh in-
terferometry at pH= 4.5, T= 25o C and at a mean lysozyme con-
centration (average of top and bottom solution concentrations) of 0.6
mM (8.6 mg/mL). Four experiments, with diﬀerent combinations of
protein and Na2SO4 concentration diﬀerences, were performed at each
of ﬁve mean Na2SO4 concentrations (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.65 and 0.8 M),
for a total of 20 experiments. In addition, we have measured dynamic
light-scattering diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the ternary system lysozyme
chloride-Na2SO4-water.

Motivation

The diﬀusion of protein is one of the fundamental processes occurring in
biological systems, and it is also an important step in the crystallization
mechanism. Obtaining protein crystal of good structural quality is often
the main issue for three dimensional atomic resolution structure studies of
biomacromolecules. Crystallization is an intrinsically non-equilibrium pro-
cess, and concentration gradients will occur around the crystal. The protein
crystallizes, reducing its concentration at the moving face of the growing
crystal and creating a protein gradient between the bulk solution and the
crystal. This gradient in turn causes multicomponent diﬀusive transport of
protein and precipitant. Diﬀusion in protein crystal growth inevitably occurs
under conditions for which no species has an uniform concentration raising
the issue of multicomponent diﬀusion.
Crystallization experiments conducted under microgravity conditions have
yielded protein crystals that provided diﬀraction data of signiﬁcantly higher
resolution than the best crystal of these proteins grown under normal con-
ditions [1]. The diﬀerence between microgravity and normal gravity is the
magnitude of the buoyancy forces. Commonly, this diﬀerence is assigned to
some consequences of the reduction of buoyancy driven convection in the
micrigravity conditions. With convection, the lysozyme concentration in the
bulk solution is more uniform [2] and the probability for nucleation of para-
sitic crystals is strongly reduced.
The complete description of an n-solute system requires an n × n matrix of
diﬀusion coeﬃcients relating the ﬂux of each solute component to the gradi-
ents of all solute components [3]. The importance of other species on protein
diﬀusion follows from the one-dimensional ﬂux relations [3]:

− J =

(Dij)v∂Cj/∂x

i = 1, ...., n

(1)

n

X
j=1

in which the cross-term diﬀusion coeﬃcients (oﬀ-diagonal elements (Dij)v i 6=
j) can be positive or negative. In ternary systems (n = 2), our case, the one-
dimensional ﬂux relations could be written as:

− J1 = (D11)v

+ (D12)v

−J2 = (D21)v

+ (D22)v

∂C2
∂x
∂C2
∂x

∂C1
∂x
∂C1
∂x

(3)

where J1 and J2 - the protein ﬂux and respectively salt ﬂux, (D11)v and (D22)v
- the main-term diﬀusion coeﬃcients relating to the ﬂux of component to its
own concentration gradient, and (D12)v and (D21)v - the cross-term diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients relating the ﬂux of each component to the gradient of the
other. For some systems [4, 5], a cross-terms (Dij)v can have considerably
larger magnitude than the main-terms (Dii)v, as our measurements show
for the Lys-Na2SO4-Water system described here and in agreement with the
results about Lys-NaCl-Water system [6]. The index v from the diﬀusion
coeﬃcients shows that the experiment were done under the assumption the
volume change on mixing and changes in concentrations across the diﬀu-
sion boundary were small. Consequently, with a good approximation, the
measured diﬀusion coeﬃcients may be considered to be for the volume-ﬁxed
reference frame [7] deﬁned by:

n

X
i=0

Ji ¯Vi = 0

(4)

where ¯Vi is the partial molar volume of the ith species, and the subscript 0
denotes the solvent.
The importance of multicomponent diﬀusion has been recognized in the crys-
tal growth community [8, 9] and a crystal growth model has properly ac-
counted for multicomponent diﬀusive transport in lysozyme chloride-NaCl-
water system [6, 10]. The experimental multicomponent diﬀusion coeﬃcients
are essential for accurate modeling of protein transport, especially in view
of the very large cross-term coeﬃcient (D21)v reported here. Moreover, the
concentration of supporting electrolyte dependence of all the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cients should be important for supersaturation region and also for its directly
contribution to the protein ﬂux.

Experimental section

All the experimental work was performed al Texas Christian University, in
the Chemistry Department.

Materials. All the materials, solution preparation procedures, apparatus
and density measurement procedures are described in the work [6]. We used
a hen egg-white lysozyme, recrystallized six times purchased from Seikagaku

3

America.
The molecular mass of the lysozyme solute, M1, was taken as 14307 g/mol,
and this value [11] was used to calculate all concentrations after correction
for the moisture and chloride content. Buoyancy corrections were made with
the commonly used lysozyme crystal density [12, 13, 14] of 1.305 g/cm3.
The molecular mass of water, Mo, was taken as 18.015 g/cm3 and the molec-
ular mass of Na2SO4, M2, was taken as 142.037 g/mol.
Mallinckrodt reagent HCl (∼ 12 M) was diluted by half with pure water
and distilled at the constant boiling composition. This resulting HCl solu-
tion (∼ 6 M) was then diluted (pH 1.2) and used to adjust the pH of solution.

Preparation of Solutions. All solutions were prepared by mass with ap-
propriate buoyancy corrections. All weighings were performed with a Met-
tler Toledo AT400 electrobalance. Since the as-received lysozyme powder
was very hygroscopic, all manipulations in which water absorption might be
critical were performed in a dry glove box. Stock solutions of lysozyme were
made by adding as-received protein to a pre-weighted bottle that had con-
tained dry box air, capping the bottle, and reweighing to get the weight and
thus mass of lysozyme. Water was added to dissolve the lysozyme, and the
solution was weighed. An accurate density measurement was made and used
to obtain the molarity of the stock solution.
For ternary experiments, precise masses of Na2SO4 were added to ﬂasks con-
taining previously weighed quantities of lysozyme stock solutions. These
solutions were mixed and diluted to within 10 cm3 of the ﬁnal volume. The
pH was adjusted, and the solutions were diluted to their ﬁnal mass.

Measurements of pH. The pH measurements were made using a Corn-
ing model 130 pH meter with an Orion model 8102 combination ROSS pH
electrode. The meter was calibrated with standard pH 7 and pH 4 buﬀers
and checked against a pH 5 standard buﬀer.

Density Measurements. All density measurements were made with a
Mettler-Paar DMA40 density meter, with an RS-232 output to a Apple Π+.
By time averaging the output, a precision of 0.00001 g/cm3 or better could
be achieved. The temperature of the vibrating tube in the density meter was
controlled with water from a large well-regulated water bath whose temper-
ature was 25.00± 0.01 o C.

Free-Diﬀusion Measurements. For binary Na2SO4-water and ternary
Lys-Na2SO4-Water we performed measurements for free-diﬀusion using the
high-precision Gosting diﬀusiometer [15, 16, 17] operated in its Rayleigh in-
terferometric optical mode. The procedure for measuring binary (D2)v and
ternary diﬀusion coeﬃcients (Dij)v were described in detail in the work [6].
In order to measure the four diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the system, the exper-
iments must be performed with at least two diﬀerent concentration diﬀer-
ences at each combination of mean concentration [15, 18, 19]. For ternary
experiments, for each pair of mean concentrations, two measurements were
performed with α1 = 0 and the two with α1 = 0.8 (αi - the refractive index
fraction due to the ith solute [6]).
In order to make the data analysis of the free-diﬀusion experiments we used
the Fick’s second law:

∂Ci
∂t

2

Dij

=

X
j=1

∂2Cj
∂x2

i = 1, 2

(5)

for two solutes. We made the assumption that the concentration diﬀerences
of the solutes across the initial boundary are small enough and the diﬀusion
coeﬃcients are constant [20]. Also the volume changes on mixing were neg-
ligible, thus all the measured diﬀusion coeﬃcients are given relative to the
volume-ﬁxed frame of reference deﬁned by equation (4).

Dynamic Light-Scattering Diﬀusion Coeﬃcients. We measured the
dynamic light-scattering diﬀusion coeﬃcients DDLS for samples from all ter-
nary experiments and for 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.65 and 0.8 M mean concentrations
of Na2SO4.
Measurements were made using a Protein Solution DynaPro-801 TC molec-
ular sizing instrument with a ﬁxed scattering angle of 90o and the procedure
was described in the work [6]. This apparatus allowed us to calculate also
the eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 of the matrix of diﬀusion coeﬃcients, the DDLS
predicted by Leaist’s theory [21] and to compare with ours and also with
interferometric value (D11)v.
The viscosity for ternary lys-Na2SO4-water system was also measured us-
ing an Ostwald viscosimeter.

Results

Ternary diﬀusion experiments were performed on the lysozyme chloride-
Na2SO4-water system at pH= 4.5 and T=250 C. To obtain the four ternary
diﬀusion coeﬃcients we performed four experiments at the same mean con-
centrations but with diﬀerent values of ∆Ci for the solutes. There were two
experiments with ∆C1 = 0 and ∆C2 6= 0 and two with ∆C1 6= 0 and ∆C2 = 0
at each mean Na2SO4 concentration of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.65 and 0.8 M. The
interferometric data for the diﬀusion coeﬃcients (D11)v, (D22)v, (D12)v and
(D21)v are reported in the Tables 1,2,3.
Partial molar volumes values, ¯V1, ¯V2 and ¯Vo, were calculated for each
component using eqs A-7 (q = 2) and 5 in [22] and reported in the Tables
1,2,3.
Values of mean density ¯d and Hi = (∂d/∂Ci)T,p,Cj,j6=i in the Table 1 were
calculated using densities of all eight solutions from each experiment set.
Densities were assumed to be linear in solute concentrations respecting the
equation [6]:

d = ¯d + H1(C1 − ¯¯C1) + H2(C2 − ¯¯C2)

(6)

where ¯¯C1 and ¯¯C2 are the averages of the mean concentrations for all four
experiments in a series.
Dynamic light-scattering experiments provided the diﬀusion coeﬃcients
DDLS for each Na2SO4 mean concentrations and also the eigenvalues λi (i =
1, 2). We could make an direct comparison to the interferometric values
(D11)v, the smallest eigenvalues of the matrix of diﬀusion coeﬃcients λ1 which
are reported in the Table 1,2,3 and the DDLS data. The values for DDLS are
approximately 4% higher than (D11)v, and approximately 5% higher than
the smallest eigenvalue λ1 of the matrix of diﬀusion coeﬃcients.
The viscosity values for ternary solution are reported also in the Tables
1,2,3 at each mean value of salt concentrations.
The diﬀusion coeﬃcients dependence on C2 mean values are shown in
the Fig.1.
From Fig. 1 we could see also the coeﬃcient (D11)v, due to the gradient of
lysozyme, corrected from viscosity. The values for main-term (D11)v are 13%
smaller than the values for the same coeﬃcient but using the lys-NaCl-water
system, at the same concentration [6]. The cross-term (D21)v for the ﬂux of
Na2SO4 caused by the gradient of lysozyme chloride increases as the Na2SO4

concentration increases. The values for (D21)v are 25% smaller than the val-
ues for the same coeﬃcient using the NaCl as salt [6]. At 0.8 M Na2SO4, this
term becomes 14 times larger than the Na2SO4 main-term diﬀusion coeﬃcient
(D22)v. The cross-term (D12)v for the ﬂux of lysozyme caused by the gradient
of Na2SO4 is small in comparison with all the other diﬀusion coeﬃcients as
it was expected, and 35% smaller than (D12)v in the case of lys-NaCl-water
[6]. Fig. 1 shows us also that the ternary main-term (D22)v, for the ﬂux of
Na2SO4 caused by the own gradient of concentration, is smaller with 1.5%
than the binary coeﬃcient (D2)v, over the entire composition range, and 40%
smaller than the (D22)v for ternary lys-NaCl-water [6], for the same range of
concentration.

Conclusions We reported the complete set of multicomponent diﬀusion co-
eﬃcients for ternary lys-Na2SO4-water system at concentrations high enough
to be relevant to crystallization studies. We also made a comparison with
the reported diﬀusion data about lys-NaCl-water [6] in order to understand
the inﬂuences of the type of salt in the diﬀusion process and, implicitly in
the crystallization process.

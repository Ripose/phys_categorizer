Both the stretch and bend vibrational spectrum and the intensity of infrared tran-

sitions in a tetrahedral molecule are studied in a U(2) algebraic model, where the

spurious states in the model Hamiltonian and the wavefunctions are exactly removed.

As an example, we apply the model to silicon tetraﬂuoride SiF4.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, algebraic methods [1,2] have been developed to be an eﬀective theory for descriptions

of vibrations, rotations, and rotation-vibration interactions in polyatomic molecules [3,4]. U(4) and

U(2) algebraic model have mostly been used so far in the analysis of experimental data. U(4) model

[5,6] takes the rotation and the vibration into account simultaneously but becomes quite complex

when the number of atoms in the molecules becomes larger than 4, while U(2) model is particularly

well suited for dealing with the stretching vibrations of polyatomic molecules such as the octahedral

and benzene-like systems [7,8]. Those two models are still extensively used for small molecules [9,10].

Recently, an active step in the development of algebraic models has been taken by Iachello and Oss

to incorporate the bending modes into the models for benzene [11] and acetylene [12]. Extending

U(2) algebraic model [3] to describe both the stretching and the bending vibrations in X3 [13] and X4

molecules [14], Frank and his co-workers have introduced a symmetry-adapted algebraic model, and

established an explicit connection between algebraic and conﬁguration space calculations. Developing

the local mode model [15], we have recently proposed an algebraic model of boson realization [16-

18] for the complete vibrations by taking full advantages of the discrete symmetries of molecular

systems. It is worth mentioning that U(k-1) and U(n) algebraic approach have been introduced for

the k=3m-3 rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of m-atomic molecules [19], and for n-1

stretching vibrational degrees of freedom of polyatomic molecules [20], respectively. However, those

two approaches are less feasible than U(4) and U(2) model in application.

In order to study vibrational modes of medium-size molecules, one usually chooses a tetrahedral

molecule as one of good samples. Its excited stretching vibrational states were explained in the local

mode model [21]. In our previous papers, the vibrational spectrum of methane was analyzed in terms

of bosonic operators [16] and q-deformed harmonic oscillators [23], however its infrared intensity was

not taken into account. Recently new algebraic SU(2) model [24] has been proposed for tetrahedral

molecules. This model needs at least eight parameters for the calculation of transition intensities. The

1

lack of experimental data did not allow such a ﬁt for the methane molecule, and interactions between

the stretch and the bend were neglected in the calculation of energy levels. Leroy et al. have up to date

presented an algebraic model [22] only for highly excited stretching modes and infrared intensities in

this system. Although a precise infrared transition model has been constructed in algebraic scheme,

it will be complex when the bending vibrations are considered.

In this letter, both stretching and bending vibrations and intensities of infrared transition of all

active modes in a tetrahedral molecule are studied in a U(2) algebraic model based on our new method

for eliminating the spurious states and spurious components in Hamiltonian. Our model transition

operator contains only ﬁve parameters. One of its applications is presented to silicon tetraﬂuoride

SiF4. Calculated results demonstrate that our method for dealing with spurious states are also eﬀective

for U(2) algebraic model, which open the possibility to use this model for analyzing the complete

vibrations in large molecules where spurious states exist. In Sec. II, considering the symmetry of a

tetrahedral molecule, we set up the model Hamiltonian, in which the interactions related to spurious

states are exactly removed. Its infrared intensity is studied in Sec. III. Application to SiF4 is given

in Sec. IV, where symmetrized bases are used to simplify calculations. Concluding remarks are made

in Sec. V.

II. HAMILTONIAN

For a tetrahedral molecule XY4, we introduce ten U(2) algebras to describe ten interactions between

atoms: Uj (2) (1 ≤ j ≤ 4) for X-Y and Uµ(2) (5 ≤ µ ≤ 10) for Y-Y interactions. The assignments of

the Cartesian coordinate system are the same as in Ref. [16]. Each Uα(2) (1 ≤ α ≤ 10) is generated
by the operators { ˆNα, ˆJ+,α ˆJ−,α, ˆJ0,α}, satisfying the following commutation relations:

[ ˆJ0,α, ˆJ±,β] = ±δαβ ˆJ±,α,
[ ˆNα, ˆJ0,β] = 0,

[ ˆJ+,α, ˆJ−,β] = 2δαβ ˆJ0,α,
[ ˆNα, ˆJ±,β] = 0.

where ˆNα is related with the Casimir operator of U(2):

2 ˆJ 2

0,α + ˆJ+,α ˆJ−,α + ˆJ−,α ˆJ+,α = ˆNα( ˆNα/2 + 1).

Denote by vα the number of quanta in the αth bond. The local basis states for each bond are labeled
by the eigenvalue Nα of ˆNα and vα, and written as |Nα, vαi. Their products provide the local bases:

|N1, v1i|N2, v2i · · · |N10, v10i ≡ |Nα, vαi.

Those Nj of equivalent bonds are equal to each other: Nj = Ns, and Nµ = Nb, where and hereafter,

the indexes j, µ, and α run from 1 to 4, 5 to 10, and 1 to 10, respectively, and footnotes s and b refer

to the X-Y couplings and the Y-Y couplings, respectively.

There are three kinds of O(2) invariant combinations of those generators:

α = ( ˆJ+,α ˆJ−,α + ˆJ−,α, ˆJ+,α)/2 − ˆNα/2,

ˆH M
ˆHα,β = 2 ˆJ0,α ˆJ0,β − ˆNα ˆNβ/2, α 6= β,
ˆVα,β = ˆJ+,α ˆJ−,β + ˆJ−,α ˆJ+,β, α 6= β.

(2.1)

2

Their matrix elements in the local bases are given in Ref. [13]. The operators ˆH M
α correspond to the
energy of the αth Morse oscillator. The operators ˆHα,β describe anharmonic terms of the type vαvβ,
while the operators ˆVα,β describe interbond couplings which, in conﬁguration space, are of the type
rαrβ, where rα and rβ are the displacement vectors of bonds α and β from their equilibrium positions.

III. INTENSITIES OF INFRARED TRANSITION

The infrared active mode is F2. The absolute absorption intensities from state v′ to v are given by

Ivv′ = νvv′ Pvv′ ,
Pvv′ = |hv| ˆTx|v′i|2 + |hv| ˆTy|v′i|2 + |hv| ˆTz|v′i|2,

where νvv′ is the frequency of the observed transition, ˆTx, ˆTy, and ˆTz correspond to the three com-
ponents of the infrared transition operator ˆT , and the state |vi denotes |Nα, vαi for short. All other
constants are absorbed in the normalization of the operator ˆT . The three components of ˆT are

ˆTx = ζs (ˆt1 − ˆt2 + ˆt3 − ˆt4) + ζb (ˆt6 − ˆt9) + ζsb (ˆt1 + ˆt2 + ˆt3 + ˆt4)(ˆt6 − ˆt9),
ˆTy = ζs (ˆt1 − ˆt2 − ˆt3 + ˆt4) + ζb (ˆt7 − ˆt10) + ζsb (ˆt1 + ˆt2 + ˆt3 + ˆt4)(ˆt7 − ˆt10),
ˆTz = ζs (ˆt1 + ˆt2 − ˆt3 − ˆt4) + ζb (ˆt5 − ˆt8) + ζsb (ˆt1 + ˆt2 + ˆt3 + ˆt4)(ˆt5 − ˆt8),

where ζs, ζb, and ζsb are parameters, and ˆtα is the local operator for the αth bond. The term with
ζsb is one of the higher order contributions of ˆT , which is necessary for describing both the stretching
and the bending active modes. The matrix elements of ˆtα are taken to be [11]

h ˆNα, vα|ˆtα| ˆNα, v′

αi = exp(−ηα|vα − v′

α|).

(3.3)

Those ηj for equivalent bonds are equal to each other: ηj ≡ ηs, and ηµ ≡ ηb.

The ﬁve parameters in the transition operator of Eqs. (3.2)-(3.3) will be determined by ﬁtting

observed data. The calculated intensity can be used to check assignments and in the study of in-

tramolecular energy relaxation in tetrahedral molecules.

IV. APPLICATION

We now apply this model to study the complete vibrational spectrum and the infrared intensity

of SiF4. To our knowledge, there are sixteen observed vibrational energy levels and thirteen infrared

intensity data for SiF4 [25].

At ﬁrst, we calculate the Hamiltonian matrix. The calculation for energy levels will be greatly

simpliﬁed if the symmetrized bases are used. For the stretch and bend states of tetrahedral molecules,

the symmetrized bases were given in Ref. [16], where the spurious states in the bases were eliminated.

For stretching overtones of large molecules, the symmetrized bases have been recently presented by
Chen et al. [26,27]. In those symmetrized bases the Hamiltonian matrix is a block one. According to

Morse potentials for the stretch and the bend vibrations in the boson-realization model [28] for this

molecule, we take two boson numbers Ns and Nb to be 100 and 15, respectively. The parameters in
Hamiltonian are determined by ﬁtting the observed data, and given in cm−1 as follows:

λs1 = −3.311,

λs2 = −4.331,

λs3 = −0.573,

λb1 = 97.982,

λb2 = −1.197,

λb3 = 74.438,

λb4 = −4.173,

λsb1 = −0.145,

λsb2 = 0.199.

The experimental data and the calculated values are listed in Table I. The standard deviation in this ﬁt
is 1.188 cm−1. From those parameters we can calculate the other values. It is worth mentioning that
McDowell et al. [25] described the same energy levels by Dunham expansion with more parameters.

This method does not provide explicitly wave functions so that some physical properties such as

transition intensities are hard to be calculated.

Then, we compute the infrared intensity. Due to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it is suﬃcient to
calculate only the z component of the transition operator, ˆTz, in the symmetrized bases. Fitting

the thirteen observed infrared intensities, we determine the parameters in the transition operator as

follows:

ηs = 40.158,

ηb = 22.853,

ζs = 3.614,

ζb = 3.286,

ζsb = 64.959.

In Table I we only list those calculated intensities to compare with known observed data. The other

calculated intensities and energy levels can be obtained from us upon request.

One may observe in Table I that most of the calculated intensities are in good agreement with the

experimental values, but a few are not. Those diﬀerences may come from that the observed intensities

Table I

4

were only approximately accurate [25], and that the other higher order contributions to the operator
ˆT were neglected.

It is worth pointing out that there are also diﬀerences in magnitude between

the calculated and the observed intensities for the stretching vibrations of octahedral molecules in

U(2) model [29] because the same simple matrix elements Eqs.(3.3) were used. The more accurate

experimental data are needed to improve the model.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have used a U(2) algebraic model for studying the stretching and bending vibrations and infrared

intensity of a tetrahedral molecule. The model Hamiltonian with nine parameters and the model

transition operator with ﬁve parameters provide quite good ﬁts to the published experimental data
of silicon tetraﬂuoride with standard deviations 1.188 cm−1 and 1.775, respectively. This is based on

our new methods for constructing symmetrized bases [16] and for removing both the spurious states

in the wavefunction space and the spurious components in the Hamiltonian [23]. For comparison, we

also studied this molecule in the boson-realization model, and obtained the corresponding standard
deviations 1.985 cm−1 and 1.745 [28]. Through this example of applications of the model, we believe

that our method for treating spurious states is useful for the model for other polyatomic molecules.

It is shown that anharmonic resonances, such as Darling-Dennison and Fermi resonances, are very

important in descriptions of highly excited vibrational states in molecules. Darling-Dennison reso-

nances can be included in the model by adding higher-order terms of the operators of Eq.(2.1). Fermi

resonances can be taken into account using perturbation theory. It should be pointed out that Fermi

resonances can be easily included in the extended local mode model [30,31] and the boson-realization

model [17], while they are described by the nondiagonal matrix elements of Majorana operators in

U(4) algebraic model. The coupling parameters in Hamiltonian we have obtained can be related to

force ﬁeld constants to be used in conjunction with a kinetic energy operator in a Schr¨odinger equation

[32]. We will consider the physical meaning of the parameters in future investigations.

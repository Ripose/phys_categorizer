Exciton Transfer Integrals Between Polymer Chains

William Barford∗
Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford,
South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QZ, United Kingdom

The line-dipole approximation for the evaluation of the exciton transfer integral, J, between
conjugated polymer chains is rigorously justiﬁed. Using this approximation, as well as the plane-
wave approximation for the exciton center-of-mass wavefunction, it is shown analytically that J ∼ L
when the chain lengths are smaller than the separation between them, or J ∼ L−1 when the chain
lengths are larger than their separation, where L is the polymer length. Scaling relations are also
obtained numerically for the more realistic standing-wave approximation for the exciton center-of-
mass wavefunction, where it is found that for chain lengths larger than their separation J ∼ L−1.8
or J ∼ L−2, for parallel or collinear chains, respectively. These results have important implications
for the photo-physics of conjugated polymers and self-assembled molecular systems, as the Davydov
splitting in aggregates and the F¨orster transfer rate for exciton migration decreases with chain
lengths larger than their separation. This latter result has obvious deleterious consequences for the
performance of polymer photovoltaic devices.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The transport of excitons - and hence energy - through molecular materials is determined by the exciton transfer
integral between neighboring conjugated chromophores. Typically, the length of these chromophores are larger than
the distances between them, and thus the usual expression for the transfer integrals, derived by invoking the dipole
Indeed, the use of the dipole approximation implies that the exciton transfer integral
approximation, is invalid.
between equivalent neighboring chromophores scales linearly as the chromophore length. This prediction contradicts
the computations of the transfer integrals using various computational techniques, which predict that the transfer
integrals vanish in the asymptotic limit1,2,3,4,5 - a result in agreement with the decreasing Davydov splitting as a
function of chromophore length observed in self-assembled molecular aggregates6.

In practice, the exact computation of exciton transfer integrals using transition densities is computationally expen-
sive. A convenient approximation is the so-called line-dipole approximation8,9, which provides a physically intuitive,
yet accurate description for exciton transfer when the chromophore separation is large enough (typically, three or four
times the monomer length).

In this paper we use the exciton model to explicitly derive the line-dipole approximation. Next, using the line-
dipole approximation, analytical expressions for the exciton transfer integral between parallel and collinear conjugated
polymers are derived, and the scaling with polymer length is determined. We conclude by discussing the implications
of these results for exciton transfer via the F¨orster mechanism.

Before deriving the line-dipole approximation, however, we review the point-dipole approximation for the evaluation

II. THE LINE DIPOLE APPROXIMATION

In this section the line-dipole approximation will be justiﬁed for a simpliﬁed model of polymers, namely a chain of
dimers (or double bonds) connected by single bonds, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This model is of course applicable to
polyacetylene. However, more generally it is also applicable if the dimer represents a monomer.

To derive the line-dipole approximation it is also necessary to introduce a model for excitons in conjugated polymers.
In the weak-coupling limit, deﬁned by the electronic band width being greater than the Coulomb interaction, the
excited states of conjugated polymers are Mott-Wannier excitons7,10, deﬁned by

transfer integral varies with the polymer length, as will be described in the next section. However, an alternative
representation of Eq. (19) will now be derived which makes a more direct comparison to the point-dipole approximation
and introduces the line-dipole approximation.

This expression for the transfer integral between conjugated polymers justiﬁes the line-dipole approximation as may
be seen as follows. Using Eq. (21), the transition dipole moment for a polymer of N monomer units may be written
as a sum of the transition dipole moments for each monomer, namely

Eq. (22) is thus derived by inserting Eq. (24) into Eq. (25).

Before discussing the evaluation of Eq. (19) and its validity, we describe the standing-wave and plane-wave approx-

imations for the center-of-mass wavefunction, Ψ(Rℓ).

For linear polymers with N equivalent monomers and open boundary conditions the exciton center-of-mass wave-

function satisﬁes,

The validity of the line-dipole approximation has already been discussed elsewhere (see ref.8 and references therein).
When R = d there is a signiﬁcant error in the line-dipole approximation result. However, for R & 2d the line-dipole
approximation result is in good agreement with the exact result for short chains, becoming essentially exact for all
chain lengths when R & 3d.

III. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper the line-dipole approximation for the evaluation of the exciton transfer integral, J, between conjugated
polymer chains has been rigorously justiﬁed for a chain of dimers. Quite generally, it is physically reasonable to apply
this approximation to a conjugated polymer or linear chromophore with general monomeric units.

Then, using the line-dipole approximation, as well as the plane-wave approximation for the exciton center-of-mass
wavefunction, it has been shown analytically that J
L when the chain lengths are smaller than the separation
between them, where L is the polymer length. However, when the chain lengths are larger than their separation,
J is a decreasing function of chain length, scaling as L−1 for the plane-wave approximation. Scaling relations have
also been obtained numerically for the more realistic standing-wave approximation for the exciton center-of-mass
L−2, for parallel
wavefunction, where it is found that for chain lengths larger than their separation J
or collinear chains, respectively.

The scaling of J

L for short chain lengths is a reﬂection of the fact that at these lengths scales the point-dipole
L. Similarly, the scaling of
approximation may be applied to the entire chain, implying that J
L−1 for collinear chains in the plane-wave approximation is easy to understand for chain lengths large compared
J
to their separation. In this case the exciton dipoles are uniformally distributed along both chains of length L. The
double line integral of r−3 trivially gives the L−1 scaling.

The scaling of J with L for long parallel chains is rather counter-intuitive, however, as it implies (as discussed
below) that the probability of exciton transfer between neighboring parallel chains is a decreasing function of length.
The physical origin of this behavior can be understood in two ways. First, consider the exciton transfer integral
In this limit J is a periodic
for parallel chains when their separation is of the order of the monomer length (d).
function of the relative shift variable D1. Fig. 7 shows J for D = 0 (the in-phase conﬁguration), D = a (the out of
phase conﬁguration), and D = a/2 (the phase-cancelation conﬁguration), illustrating this periodic variation. As the
separation between parallel chains increases this periodic variation vanishes because of interference eﬀects from longer

distance transition densities. It is these interference eﬀects that mean ultimately the exciton transfer integral must
vanish in the asymptotic limit for chain separations greater than a few monomer lengths.

A second way to motivate this scaling behavior is to consider the sign of J as two ﬁnite-length dipoles are moved
longitudinally relative to another. As they slide passed each other the sign of J will change once the magic angle
(θ = cos−1(1/√3)) is reached. Evidently, in the limit of inﬁnitely long chains this thought-experiment is nonsensical,
implying that J = 0.

The results for the exciton transfer integral have been derived using the assumption that the exciton center-of-mass
wavefunction, Ψ, is described either by a standing wave or a plane wave. The standing wave approximation is more
relevant than the plane wave approximation in linear conjugated polymers or chromophores, although the plane wave
approximation enables analytical results to be derived. In reality, however, disorder or self-trapping will modify the
exciton center-of-mass wavefunction from both of these idealized functional forms, and under these circumstances it
is necessary to evaluate Eq. (19) with the explicit form of Ψ. Such a calculation is beyond the scope of the present
paper.

The results presented in this paper have important implications for the photo-physics of conjugated polymers and
self-assembled molecular systems. First, as already reported1,2,3,4,5, the Davydov splitting in aggregates is a decreasing
function of chain length for chain lengths larger than their separation. Second, the F¨orster transfer rate, k, is reduced
by a factor of f 2( ˜L), where f ( ˜L) is the correction to the point-dipole approximation for the entire chain, shown in
Fig. 4. This conclusion may be understood by noting that in the point-dipole approximation,

where ID(ω), the donor emission spectrum, and αA(ω), the acceptor absorption spectrum, are both proportional
to the square of the transition dipole moments.
In the line-dipole approximation, therefore, there is a correction
of f ( ˜L) for each of these squared transition dipole moments. This latter result has obvious important deleterious
consequences for the performance of polymer photovoltaic devices where exciton migration occurs via F¨orster transfer
between neighboring conjugated polymers or chromophores.

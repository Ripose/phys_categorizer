Transverse wavevector dependent and frequency dependent

dielectric function, magnetic permittivity and generalized

conductivity of interaction site ﬂuids. MD calculations

Abstract

It is shown that the dielectric properties of interaction site models of po-

lar ﬂuids can be investigated in computer experiment using not only the

charge ﬂuctuations but also correlations corresponding to a current of mov-

ing charges. This current can be associated with a generalized dynami-

cal polarization or separated into electric and magnetic components. The

ﬁrst approach deals with the dielectric permittivity related to a generalized

conductivity, whereas the second one leads to the functions describing po-

larization and magnetization ﬂuctuations separately. The last way is only

the source to calculate the magnetic susceptibility for a system of interac-

tion sites. The transverse wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric

functions and magnetic susceptibility are evaluated for the TIP4P water

model in a very wide scale of wavelengths and frequencies using molecular

dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the transverse part of the di-

electric functions may diﬀer drastically from their longitudinal component.

A relationship between the two approaches is discussed and the limiting

transition to the static dielectric constant in the inﬁnite-wavelength regime

is analyzed. The propagation of transverse electromagnetic waves in the

TIP4P water is also considered.

I. MOTIVATION

In a recent paper [1], a computer adapted ﬂuctuation formula suitable for self-

consistent calculations of the longitudinal wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric

function εL(k, ω) for interaction site models (ISMs) of polar systems has been proposed.
As a result, a detailed analysis of this function in the entire wavelength and time scales

was carried out for the TIP4P water model using molecular dynamics (MD). It was shown
that the choice of microscopic variables for the operator ˆP of polarization density plays an

important role in a correct reproduction of dielectric properties, and only true microscopic

variables, which explicitly take into account the charge distribution within molecules, can

be used to determine the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity of ISMs at

arbitrary wavenumbers.

It is a common practice to investigate the dielectric properties of ISMs on the basis of

charge ﬂuctuations [1–3]. In the inﬁnite-wavelength limit k

0, these ﬂuctuations reduce

→

to the well-known longitudinal dipole moment correlations, which are usually considered

in computer experiment to obtain εL(k, ω) at zero and small wavevector values [4–12]. The
transverse dipole moment ﬂuctuations are used sometimes [5, 9, 10–12] for treating the

transverse component εT(k, ω) of the dielectric permittivity. However, such an approach,
being exact for point dipole systems [13, 14], cannot be applied to calculations of the

genuine transverse dielectric function of ISMs at nonzero wavenumbers.

The problem of computations of εT(k, ω) for ISM ﬂuids is due to diﬃculties [15, 16]
when constructing the transverse part of ˆP . While the longitudinal part ˆP L can easily
be expressed in terms of the operator of charge density, to deﬁne the transverse compo-
nent ˆP T involving additional dynamical variables is necessary. There are two approaches
for describing the electromagnetic phenomena in ISMs. They diﬀer between themselves

in the way of how to treat the current of moving charges. In the abbreviated approach

[17], electric and magnetic parts of the total current are undistinguishable from one an-

other in the presence of spatially inhomogeneous ﬁelds, i.e, when k

phenomena in the system are determined by a transverse dielectric permittivity εT(k, ω)
which is directly connected with the generalized conductivity σT(k, ω) = iω
1).
The second approach [18] is based on a separation of the microscopic current into elec-

4π (εT(k, ω)

−

tric and magnetic parts at arbitrary wavenumbers. This leads to the introduction of

two functions, ǫT(k, ω)

= εT(k, ω) and µ(k, ω), describing the transverse ﬂuctuations

of polarization and magnetization densities separately. The last function is associated

with a generalized magnetic permittivity of ISM systems.

In this approach the trans-

verse dielectric permittivity εT(k, ω) can easily be reproduced using functions ǫT(k, ω)
and µ(k, ω).

Until recently, quite a few papers [19, 20] dealt with the investigation of correlations

related to the current of charges in ISMs. In these articles, spectra of the longitudinal

and transverse components of the hydrogen current, on the time scale peculiar to the

librational dynamics of water, were calculated for the TIP4P potential at small wavenum-

bers. The ﬁrst calculation of the transverse dielectric function ǫT(k) = limω
0 ǫT(k, ω)
has been performed by Raineri and Friedman [16], but in the static regime only and for

→

the simplest ξDS model. At the same time, there were no attempts to investigate the

entire wavevector and frequency dependence of the transverse dielectric function and the

magnetic susceptibility for ISM ﬂuids.

In the present paper the dielectric properties of ISMs are investigated on the basis

of current correlations, including their separation into electric and magnetic parts. This

allows us to determine both the longitudinal and transverse components of the dielectric

permittivity ε(k, ω) as well as the dielectric ǫT(k, ω) and magnetic µ(k, ω) functions.
Actual MD simulations are performed for the TIP4P model of water using the interaction

site reaction ﬁeld (ISRF) geometry [3] and the Ewald method. The results obtained for

ǫT(k, ω) and µ(k, ω) are presented in a wide region of wavevectors and frequencies.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC FLUCTUATION FORMULAS FOR ISM FLUIDS

of M interaction sites and enclosed in a volume V . The microscopic density of charges for

As we can see, using the microscopic operator ˆQ(k, t) of charge density allows one to
determine uniquely only the longitudinal part of polarization vector ˆP (k, t). To construct

the transverse part, it is necessary to involve additional dynamical variables. We shall

show now how to derive ﬂuctuation formulas which give the possibility to computer both

the longitudinal as well as the transverse component of the dielectric constant of ISMs.

The processes of dynamical polarization in dielectrics cause a current of charges. This

In the case of dynamical polarization, when I(k, ω) =

= 0 at ω

= 0 (note

that static macroscopic currents of coupled charges are equal to zero), the Maxwell equa-

tions can be written in a form as for conductors, namely, in terms of the generalized

polarization conductivity σ(k, ω). The longitudinal and transverse components σL,T(k, ω)
of this wavevector- and frequency-dependent conductivity are deﬁned via the material
relations I L,T(k, ω) = σL,T(k, ω)EL,T(k, ω).

The ﬂuctuation formulas (5) and (6) can be used in simulations to evaluate the lon-

gitudinal and transverse components of the dielectric constant on the basis of equilib-

rium current-current correlations (7).

In the case of longitudinal ﬂuctuations, the for-

mula (5) is mathematically equivalent to the usual relation (2). Indeed, in view of the
equality ˆI L(k, t) = d

ˆP L(k, t), it can be shown easily that CL(k, t) =

¨GL(k, t). Then applying the Laplace transform we obtain Liω(CL(k, t)) = ˙GL(k, 0) +

˙GL(k, t)), where ˙GL(k, 0) = 0 because the Kirkwood factor GL(k, t) is an even

function on time, and we immediately recover the ﬂuctuation formula (2) from (5).
Furthermore, taking into account that Liω(

GL(k, 0) is connected with the dynamical Kirkwood factor of second order

Finally, we would like to discuss about a relationship of the two approaches presented

in more detail. In the abbreviated approach the electric and magnetic parts in the total

current are not distinguished from one another. In such a situation the magnetic part is
included into the generalized ˆP -vector (3) and the transverse electromagnetic ﬂuctuations

are described by one function only, namely, by the generalized dielectric constant εT(k, ω).
This including indeed can be realized because at k, ω
= 0 magnetic ﬁelds are expressed

in terms of electric ﬁelds E using the Maxwell equation c rotE =
representation, i.e., ck×E(k, ω) =

ωBT(k, ω), where BT(k, ω) = µ(k, ω)HT(k, ω). At
the same time, the extended approach involves two quantities, ǫT(k, ω) and µ(k, ω), for
the description. As far as these two approaches deal with the same microscopic current,

∂B/∂t in (k, ω)-

the quantities εT(k, ω), ǫT(k, ω) and µ(k, ω) are not independent. The corresponding
relation can be found comparing the right-hand sides of equations (3) and (11) between

themselves and using material equations. Then one obtains

and, therefore, the wavevector- and frequency-dependent magnetic permittivity is caused

by the diﬀerence between functions εT(k, ω) and ǫT(k, ω).

The simplest way to obtain the explicit ﬂuctuation formula for the magnetic permit-

tivity is based on relation (15) and ﬂuctuation formulas (6) and (14) for εT(k, ω) and
ǫT(k, ω). In view of equation (11), the transverse current autocorrelation function cT(k, t)
(7), appearing in ﬂuctuation formula (6) for εT(k, ω), can be expressed in terms of the
2Nd2 cor-
polarization gT(k, t) and magnetization sT(k, t) =
∂2gT(k, t)/∂t2. It is necessary to point out
relation functions as cT(k, t) = c2k2sT(k, t)

From the afore said, it is obvious that the two approaches are completely equivalent for

the evaluations of the generalized dielectric permittivity εT(k, ω) and they can be applied
with equal successes to theoretical applications. However, the extended description is

III. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS FOR THE TIP4P MODEL

Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the TIP4P potential [21] at a

density of 1 g/cm3 and at a temperature of T = 293 K. We performed two runs cor-

responding to the ISRF [3] and Ewald [22] geometries. The equations of motion were

integrated on the basis of a matrix method [23] with a time step of 2 fs. The observation

times over the equilibrium state were 500 000 and 1 000 000 time steps for the Ewald and

ISRF geometry, respectively. The time correlation functions were calculated in an interval
of 2 ps for the wavenumbers k = [0, 1, . . . , 300]kmin, where kmin = 2π/L = 0.319˚A−
L is the length of the simulation box edge. The parameters η = 5.76/L and kmax = 5kmin

and

have been used in the Ewald summation of the Coulomb forces. Other details of the

simulations are similar to those reported earlier [1].

The longitudinal component GL(k) of the static wavevector-dependent Kirkwood fac-

tor, calculated in the simulations within the Ewald and ISRF geometries,

is shown

ometry the function D(k) = 3j1(kR)/(kR) diﬀers from zero considerably, especially
at small wavenumbers, to evaluate the inﬁnite-system Kirkwood factor gL(k) the per-
formance of self-consistent transformations (9) is necessary. This result is plotted

by the solid curve. Within the Ewald geometry [22] the function D(k) is equal to

factor is equivalent to that, obtained in the simulations (excepting the case k = 0). As

we can see from the ﬁgure, the both Ewald and ISRF methods lead to identical results

for gL(k). The static Kirkwood factor of second order, CL,T(k) (equation (7)), is pre-
sented in ﬁg. 1b. As was pointed out earlier, this function is free of boundary conditions

and the inﬁnite-system dependence cL,T(k) can be reproduced directly in the simulations.
This is conﬁrmed by our calculations performed in the diﬀerent geometries. The obtained

values for CL,T(k) are practically indistinguishable from those evaluated from analytical
expressions (A5) for cL,T(k). They diﬀer from one another within statistical noise only.

Samples of the normalized, dynamical Kirkwood factor of second order, ΨL,T(k, t) =

CL,T(k, t)/CL,T(k), are plotted in ﬁg. 2. The longitudinal
cL(k, t)/cL(k) within the ISRF geometry at arbitrary wavenumbers and for the Ewald
geometry at k = 0 have been determined applying the inverse Laplace transform to

inﬁnite-system functions

relations (9), whereas cT(k, t) = CT(k, t) for the transverse functions. We note that
CL(k, t) = CT(k, t) at k = 0. At k
= 0 the Ewald method reproduces directly the
inﬁnite-system behaviour. The agreement between the two sets of data for cL,T(k, t), cor-
responding to the ISRF and Ewald geometries, is quite good. It is worth to remark also

that the zeroth time moment

As was shown in the preceding section, the longitudinal static Kirkwood factor GL(k)

of order zero can be determined through the ﬁrst time moment on the dynamical Kirkwood

factor CL(k, t) of second order (see equation (8)). The calculated in such a way function
GL(k) within the ISRF geometry and the function gL(k) (via cL(k, t)) using the Ewald
method are presented in ﬁg. 1a by rotated and direct crosses, respectively. As we see from

the calculations, these functions diﬀer considerably from those obtained in the usual way.
This diﬀerence occurs because the calculation of the expression Liω(CL(k, t))/iω at small

12

frequencies is very sensitive to the precision of the evaluation of Liω(CL(k, t)) (dividing two
small quantities between themselves). The problem is complicated additionally because

this evaluation requires a numerical integration of time correlation functions which are de-

ﬁned in simulations approximately within a statistical noise. Therefore, this method is not

recommended for the investigation of the longitudinal dielectric constant at low frequency

values. However, in the opposite inﬁnite-frequency limit, the calculation via equation (5)

can be more convenient than using the usual way (2). For example, in this limit, where

→

εL(k, ω)
0. The
−
exact computation of iωLiω(gL(k, t)) at large frequencies may lead to a problem (mul-
tiplying of quantities with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent orders). This situation is absent in the

case when ﬂuctuation formula (5) is applied to calculations.

And now we are in a position to discuss a behaviour of the generalized dielectric

permittivity in the low frequency regime ω

0. As was established previously [1], the

real part of the longitudinal dielectric permittivity εL(k, ω) at ω

of two singularities, where εL(k) =

of cT(k, t), especially at small wavevectors and in the case of the Ewald method, where the
length of the simulation was twice smaller than for the ISRF geometry. For the last rea-

son, all other results will be presented in the ISRF geometry only. The computations show

that a much more reliable evaluation can be performed when the generalized permittivity

εT(k, ω) is found via relation (15), i.e., in terms of the transverse dielectric ǫT(k, ω) and
magnetic µ(k, ω) functions which correspond to polarization gT(k, t) and magnetization

It is necessary to stress that the transverse dielectric permittivity εT(k, ω) has a singu-

plotted in ﬁgs. 4 and 5, respectively. The librational oscillations superimposed on the

exponential, found previously [1, 6] for longitudinal polarization ﬂuctuations, are iden-

tiﬁed for transverse functions ΦT(k, t) as well. But the oscillations damp more quickly

and their amplitudes are much smaller in this case. The oscillations vanish completely

at larger wavevectors, namely at k > 20kmin. The magnetization correlation functions

ΥT(k, t) also exhibit oscillatory features, which are more visible at small wavenumbers.

These functions, however, can accept as positive as well as negative values, contrary to

the polarization correlations ΦT(k, t) which remain positive anywhere in time space. It

is worth remarking that after a suﬃciently long period, the polarization functions decay

purely exponentially in time. This fact has been taken into account by us to calculate

great frequencies the transverse component tends to the longitudinal dielectric constant,

so that, for example, at small wavenumbers k

indistinguishable from one another at ω > 10 THz (see ﬁg. 6). For larger wavevectors the

transverse function (ﬁg. 7) diﬀers from the longitudinal one (ﬁgs. 6, 7 of [1]) considerably.

ment of own magnetic dipole moments along the ﬁeld H 0, leading to a paramagnetic-like

behaviour with χ′(k, ω) > 0. The second one is caused by the magnetizability of molecules

owing to the changes of angular velocities in magnetic ﬁelds. Then the corresponding ad-

ditional magnetic moment of the system will be directed oppositely to H 0-vector that

may lead to a diamagnetic-like behaviour with χ′(k, ω) < 0. As we can see from ﬁg. 8, at

relatively small frequencies, the TIP4P water exhibits paramagnetic features. Beginning

from frequencies of order 100-300 THz (in dependence on wavevector) and higher the dia-

magnetic contributions into the magnetization become to dominate and the system under

consideration behaves like a diamagnetics. It is interesting to remark that the frequencies

C. Propagation of electromagnetic waves

and ǫT(k, ω) diﬀer from one another by order of χ(k, ω). As was shown in the preceding
subsection, the magnetic susceptibility of ISM systems is suﬃciently small at arbitrary

We shall consider a case when plane waves are damped in direction of their propagation,
i.e., when k′·k′′ = k′k′′.

Numerical results for the dispersion ω(k′) and damping k′′(ω), coeﬃcients in the in-

frared region of spectrum are shown in ﬁgs. 10a and 10b, respectively. We note that

calculation of the damping coeﬃcient at great frequencies is very sensitive to the preci-

sion of evaluation of the dielectric constant. A more accurate estimation can be achieved

when the dielectric constant is determined in terms of current ﬂuctuations via ﬂuctuation

formula (5) (the solid curve in ﬁg. 10b), instead of the usual formula (2) (the open circles).

when amplitudes of ﬁelds either increase or decrease in time and space. Since arbitrary

we consider the case of purely imaginary frequencies, ω

The function ε(ω∗) is plotted in ﬁg. 11a.

It describes the response of the system on

external electric ﬁelds which increase in time exponentially. As was expected, this function

at ω∗

tends to unity owing the inertness of polar molecules.

The case ω∗ > 0 will correspond to decaying in time of electric ﬁelds. This decaying

can be caused either by decreasing of external ﬁelds or by switching oﬀ of sources which

support these ﬁelds. As an example, consider the spatial and time decay of electromagnetic

ﬁelds in the system after the passage of transverse electromagnetic waves. In this situation,

frequency and wavevector are purely imaginary quantities, i.e., ω

ε(ω) in equation (20) and obtain ω∗ = ck′′/

εT(k, ω)
real values at purely imaginary frequencies. We note that an independent parameter in
ω∗t of

this equality is k′′, so that the function ω∗(k′′) will describe the time decay

ε(ω∗), where ε(ω∗) accepts purely

the transverse electric ﬁeld with a spatial inhomogeneity of k′′ which has been created

by the passed electromagnetic wave (see ﬁg. 10b). The function ω∗(k′′) is shown in

ﬁg. 11b. As can be seen, weak spatial inhomogeneities correspond to long life times

1/ω∗(k′′), whereas strong inhomogeneous ﬁelds damp in time faster.

It is worth to

remark also that in the asymptotic limit t

, the time correlation function Φ(t) decays
t/τrel, where τrel = 6.7ps is the relaxation time. Therefore,

→ ∞

e−

the dielectric constant ε(ω) at imaginary frequencies can be deﬁned only in the region

ω < 1/τrel = 0.149 THz, because otherwise the integral in (21) is divergent. This merely

ℑ
means that transverse electromagnetic excitations cannot damp in time faster than with

the characteristic interval τrel. The limiting region of imaginary frequencies is shown in

ﬁg. 11b by the horizontal dashed line.

Finally, as far as real ε′

The relations (23) are similar to the well-known Kramers-Kronig expressions for the di-

electric constant of conductors [17]. They can be applied to the transverse frequency-

dependent dielectric constant of ISMs at arbitrary values of wavevector.

We have established that the calculation of the dielectric quantities for interaction

site models of polar ﬂuids can be performed in computer experiment by two alternative

ways, namely, using either charge or current ﬂuctuations. The ﬁrst way is more eﬃcient

to evaluate the longitudinal component εL(k, ω) of the dielectric permittivity, whereas

IV. CONCLUSION

23

the second method is suitable to obtain its transverse part εT(k, ω). Separating the
total current of moving charges into electrical and magnetic components, the transverse
generalized dielectric permittivity εT(k, ω) = ǫT(k, ω) + c2k2
χ(k,ω)
1+χ(k,ω) has been expressed in
ω2
terms of the transverse dielectric ǫT(k, ω) and magnetic χ(k, ω) functions. These functions
have been evaluated for the TIP4P model of water by molecular dynamics simulations

in the whole region of wavevectors and frequencies for the ﬁrst time on the basis of the

proposed ﬂuctuation formulas.

It has been shown that the transverse ǫT(k, ω) and longitudinal ǫL(k, ω)

εL(k, ω)
components of the dielectric tensor ǫ(k, ω) diﬀer between themselves in a characteristic

≡

way and coincide with one another in opposite limits of either very small wavenumbers or

very large wavevector and frequency values. Moreover, contrary to the case of longitudinal

ﬂuctuations, the generalized dielectric permittivity εT(k, ω) exhibits a speciﬁc behaviour
when both wavenumber and frequency tend to zero. We has identiﬁed also that at great

frequencies the TIP4P water can be considered as a weak diamagnetics. However, values

of the magnetic susceptibility χ(k, ω) are much smaller in amplitude than those for real

water, because the electronic magnetization is not included in this model. It is worth to

stress that in the present investigation the polarization and magnetization microscopic

densities have been constructed taking into account explicitly the atomic structure of

ISMs. As a result, it has been demonstrated, in particular, that at nonzero wavevectors the

genuine transverse dielectric function ǫT(k, ω) has nothing to do with that obtained in the
point dipole approximation. The last function behaves like the dielectric permittivity of a

Stockmayer system [12–14] and can be used at small wavenumbers only as an estimation

of the frequency-dependent dielectric constant in the inﬁnite-wavelength limit.

The longitudinal and transverse components of the wavevector- and frequency-depen-

dent dielectric permittivity describe all electromagnetic phenomena in the system. The

knowledge of these quantities may present an interest in both theory and pure experiment.

The performed calculations can be extended, in principle, to more realistic models of polar

ﬂuids. This will be the subject of a separate consideration.

Fig. 1. The wavevector-dependent longitudinal Kirkwood factor gL(k) (a) and the
longitudinal and transverse components cL,T(k) (b) of the current autocorrelation func-
tion for the TIP4P water. The dashed and solid curves in (a) correspond to the ﬁnite

and inﬁnite systems in the ISRF geometry. The results of the Ewald geometry for the

longitudinal and transverse components are presented by the full squares and circles, re-

spectively, whereas the corresponding data in (b) obtained within the ISRF geometry

are displayed as open squares and circles. The analytical evaluation of cL,T(k) (equation
(A5)) is plotted in (b) by the solid curves. The calculations of gL(k), performed through
the dynamical current correlations (see equation (8)), are shown by the direct and rotated

crosses for the Ewald and ISRF geometries, respectively.

Fig. 2. The normalized dynamical total current correlation functions of the TIP4P

water. The result of the Ewald geometry for the longitudinal and transverse components

is presented as open and full circles, respectively. The data, obtained within the ISRF

geometry for the inﬁnite system, are plotted by the corresponding solid curves. The

longitudinal component of the ﬁnite system within the ISRF geometry is shown as the

dashed curve.

Fig. 3. The wavevector-dependent transverse dielectric function ǫT(k) (a) and gener-
alized conductivity σT(k) (b) in the low frequency limit (the solid curves). The dielectric
function corresponding to the PD approximation and the conductivity, calculated in terms

of total current (instead of magnetization) correlations are shown in subsets (a) and (b)

as the dashed curve and open circles, respectively.

Fig. 4. The normalized, time autocorrelation functions of the transverse polarization

ﬂuctuations in the TIP4P water. The results of the PD approximation are shown as

dashed curves. Note that in the inﬁnite-wavelength limit k

0 (see subset (a)), the PD

→

functions are identical to genuine ones.

Fig. 5. The normalized, time autocorrelation functions of the transverse magnetiza-

tion ﬂuctuations in the TIP4P water. Notations as for ﬁg. 4.

Fig. 6. The transverse component of the wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielec-

tric function ǫT(k, ω) of the TIP4P water at small wavenumbers. The real and imaginary
parts are plotted by the bold solid and dashed curves, respectively. For comparison the

longitudinal component is shown by the corresponding thin solid and dashed curves.

Fig. 7. The transverse component of the wavevector- and frequency-dependent di-

electric function of the TIP4P water at great wavenumbers. The real and imaginary parts

are plotted by the solid and dashed curves, respectively.

Fig. 8. The wavevector- and frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility of the

TIP4P water. The real and imaginary parts are plotted by the solid and dashed curves,

respectively. Note that the results are shown in a negative representation.

Fig. 9. The wavevector-dependent magnetic susceptibility in the inﬁnite-frequency

regime (full circles connected by the solid curve). Note that the result in the PD ap-

proximation is independent on wavenumbers (horizontal dashed curve). The PD function

calculated in the MD simulations is shown as open circles.

Fig. 10. The dispersion (a) and spatial damping (b) of transverse electromagnetic

waves in the TIP4P water.

Fig. 11. (a) The dielectric constant of the TIP4P water in the inﬁnite-wavelength

limit as a function of purely imaginary frequencies. (b) The time decay of electromagnetic

ﬁelds in the system after the passage of transverse electromagnetic waves.

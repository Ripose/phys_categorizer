Abstract

We discuss a symmetry-adapted algebraic (or vibron) model for molecular spectroscopy. The

model is formulated in terms of tensor operators under the molecular point group. In this way, we

have identiﬁed interactions that are absent in previous versions of the vibron model, in which the

Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of Casimir operators and their products. The inclusion of these

new interactions leads to reliable spectroscopic predictions. As an example we study the vibrational

excitations of the methane molecule, and compare our results with those obtained in other algebraic

models.

Introduction

The development and reﬁnement of experimental techniques in high resolution spectroscopy has generated

a wealth of new data on rovibrational spectra of polyatomic molecules. Highly symmetric molecules, such

as tetrahedral XY4 systems, form an ideal testing ground. On the one hand, the high degree of symmetry

tends to reduce the complexity of the spectrum and on the other hand, the use of symmetry concepts

and group theoretical techniques may help to interpret the data and eventually suggest new experiments

[1, 2]. A good example is provided by the methane molecule, for which there exists a large amount of

information on vibrational energies.

Ab initio calculations for rovibrational spectra of molecular systems attempt exact solutions of the

Schr¨odinger equation. These calculations involve several conﬁgurations associated with the molecular

electronic states and yield the force ﬁeld constants [3, 4] from which the spectrum can be generated [5].

For small molecules this procedure is still feasible, but this is in general not the case for polyatomic

molecules, due to the large size of the conﬁguration space. Despite the progress made in ab initio

calculations, a direct comparison with experimental vibrational energies of methane still shows large

deviations, especially for vibrational states with a higher number of quanta.

An alternative method is provided by algebraic (or vibron) models (for a review see [6, 7]). The

general method consists of two ingredients: (i) the introduction of U (k + 1) as the spectrum generating

algebra for k degrees of freedom, and (ii) for a system of bosonic degrees of freedom the states are assigned

to the symmetric representation [N ] of U (k + 1).

In its original formulation [8, 9], rotations and vibrations were treated simultaneously in terms of

coupled U (4) algebras:

= U1(4)

U2(4)

. . . , by introducing a U (4) algebra for each bond (k = 3).

The electronic degrees of freedom can be included by introducing a unitary group for the electrons [10].

For polyatomic molecules it was found to be more convenient to ﬁrst separate the rotations and vibrations

and subsequently to treat the vibrations in terms of coupled U (2) algebras [11, 12]:

= U1(2)

introducing a U (2) algebra for each interatomic potential (k = 1). In this version of the vibron model

the calculation of matrix elements is greatly simpliﬁed. An additional advantage is that it is well-suited

to incorporate the underlying discrete symmetries.

In a diﬀerent approach, it has been suggested to use a U (k + 1) model for the k = 3n

3 rotational

−

and vibrational degrees of freedom of a n-atomic molecule [13]. This model has the advantage that

it incorporates all rotations and vibrations and takes into account the relevant point group symmetry.

However, for larger molecules the number of possible interactions and the size of the Hamiltonian matrices

increase rapidly. A similar approach can be used for the vibrations only [14].

In this contribution, we discuss a symmetry-adapted version of the vibron model [15, 16, 17, 18] which

is very well suited to describe the vibrations of polyatomic molecules, especially those with a high degree

2

of symmetry. The method is based on a set of coupled U (2) algebras, whose generators are projected on

tensor operators under the molecular point group. In order to illustrate these ideas we ﬁrst review the

main ingredients of the U (2) vibron model, its connection with the Morse oscillator and the harmonic

limit. Next we develop the formalism in more detail and take as an example the methane molecule which

has tetrahedral symmetry. Wherever possible, we make a comparison between the present formulation

and other algebraic models.

3 Symmetry-adapted algebraic model

The U (2) model described above was introduced to treat the stretching vibrations of diatomic molecules

[11]. For polyatomic molecules it was suggested to treat the vibrational excitations in terms of coupled

U (2) algebras. This formulation was found to be very well suited to incorporate the underlying discrete

symmetries [12]. In particular, invariant interactions under the point group were constructed by applying

proyection techniques on an expansion of the Hamiltonian in terms of Casimir invariants. In this section,

we apply this process of symmetry adaptation to the generators of the U (2) algebras themselves, rather

than to the Casimir operators. This procedure leads to new interaction terms.

We illustrate the method by an application to the stretching and bending vibrations of methane. In

the present approach, we associate a U (2) algebra with each relevant interatomic interaction. For the CH4

molecule we have four U (2) algebras corresponding to the C-H interactions and six more representing

the H-H couplings. The molecular dynamical group is then given by the product
ˆNi, ˆJ+,i, ˆJ−,i, ˆJ0,i}

the H-H couplings, which correspond to the stretching and bending modes, respectively.

The tetrahedral symmetry of methane is taken into account by projecting the local operators

which act on bond i, on the irreducible representations Γ of the tetrahedral group

expansion coeﬃcients are the same as those given in [20] for the one-phonon wave functions. The algebraic

Hamiltonian is now constructed by repeated couplings of these tensors to a total symmetry A1.

The methane molecule has nine vibrational degrees of freedom. Four of them correspond to the

fundamental stretching modes (A1
[21]. A convenient labeling for the vibrational levels of CH4 is provided by (ν1, νl2

F2) and the other ﬁve to the fundamental bending modes (E

been excluded in order to remove the spurious contributions from the Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltion of Eq. (13) is equivalent to an expansion in terms of Casimir operators. It has the

advantage, though, that the spurious contributions have been eliminated from the outset. A comparison

with the Hamiltonian of [20] yields three conditions on their parameters

A5 + 2B5,10 + 8B5,6 = 0 ,

B1,5 + B1,8 = 0 ,

λ1,5 + λ1,8 = 0 .

The ﬁrst condition eliminates the spurious interaction from the bending Hamiltonian of [20], whereas the

latter two eliminate the spurious contributions from the stretching-bending interactions. We note that the

condition on the Hamiltonian that was used in [20] to exclude the spurious terms, does not automatically

hold for states with higher number of quanta, nor does it remove all spurious contributions.

3.2 Harmonic limit

In the harmonic limit the interaction terms of Eq. (13) have a particularly simple form, which can be

directly related to conﬁguration space interactions

We note, that the recently introduced boson-realization model [23] corresponds to the harmonic limit

operators, aΓx, †

γ . The diﬀerence between the two lies in the anharmonic contributions which are

and aΓx

implicit in the U (2) approach, but which vanish in the harmonic limit [22].

3.3 Higher order interactions

The zeroth order Hamiltonian of Eq. (13) is not suﬃcient to obtain a high-quality ﬁt of the vibrations

of methane. For example, the results presented in [20] were obtained by ﬁtting 19 vibrational energies
with a r.m.s. deviation of 12.16 cm−1. The boson-realization model of [23] which, as was shown above,

corresponds to the harmonic limit of the present approach was applied to the same 19 vibrations with a
r.m.s. deviation of 11.61 cm−1. We note, however, that the latter calculation includes some higher order

interactions, without signiﬁcantly improving the results.

Several physically meaningful interaction terms that are essential for an improved ﬁt are not present

in Eq. (13). They arise in the present model as higher order interactions. Products of ˆ

The interpretation of the ωi and α3 terms follows from Eq. (17). The Xij terms are quadratic in the
operators ˆ

Γx and hence represent anharmonic vibrational interactions. The gij terms are related to

the vibrational angular momenta associated with the degenerate vibrations. As mentioned above, these

interactions, which are fundamental to describe molecular systems with a high degree of symmetry, are

absent in previous versions of the vibron model in which the interaction terms are expressed in terms

of Casimir operators and products thereof. In the harmonic limit, the expectation value of the diagonal

terms in Eq. (22) leads to the familiar Dunham expansion [21]

4 Results

The Hamiltonian of Eq. (22) involves 23 interaction strengths and the two boson numbers, Ns and

Nb. The vibron number associated with the stretching vibrations is determined from the spectroscopic

constants ωe and xeωe for the CH molecule to be Ns = 43 [20]. The vibron number for the bending

vibrations, which are far more harmonic than the stretching vibrations, is taken to be Nb = 150. We

have carried out a least-square ﬁt to the vibrational spectrum of methane including 44 energies. We ﬁnd

an overall ﬁt to the observed levels with a r.m.s. deviation which is an order of magnitude better than in
previous studies. While the r.m.s. deviations of [20] and [23] are 12.16 and 11.61 cm−1 for 19 energies,
we ﬁnd a r.m.s. of 1.16 cm−1 for 44 energies. The values of the ﬁtted parameters as well as all predicted

levels up to V = 3 can be found in [18, 24].

The α3 term plays an important role in the calculation. It is completely anharmonic in origin and its

contribution to the excitation energies vanishes in the harmonic limit. In order to address the importance

of this term in Eq. (22) we have carried out another calculation without this term. With one less
interaction term the r.m.s. deviation increases from 1.16 to 4.48 cm−1. This shows the importance of

the term proportional to α3 to obtain an accurate description of the anharmonicities that are present in

the data. The absence of the α3 term in the second calculation can only partially be compensated by the

anharmonicity constants Xij.

5 Summary and conclusions

In summary, we have discussed a symmetry-adapted algebraic model for molecular vibrations, in which

the symmetry adaptation is applied at the level of the generators. This procedure has several interesting

aspects:

•

•

•

it provides a systematic procedure to construct all interaction terms up to a certain order,

the harmonic limit gives a relation with conﬁguration space interactions and Dunham expansions,

the spurious states can be removed exactly.

The application to the 44 observed vibrational excitations of methane gives a good overall ﬁt with a
r.m.s. deviation of 1.16 cm−1 corresponding to an accuracy of

0.10 %, which can be considered

of spectroscopic quality.

It was pointed out that the

VF2,s term in combination with the anharmonic eﬀects in the other
interaction terms plays a crucial role in obtaining a ﬁt of this quality. Purely anharmonic terms of

this sort arise naturally in the symmetry-adapted algebraic model, but vanish in the harmonic limit.

9

Physically, these contributions arise from the anharmonic character of the interatomic interactions, and

seem to play an important role when dealing with molecular anharmonicities.

We have established an explicit relation with the algebraic model of [20], in which the Hamiltonian is

expressed in terms of Casimir operators. A comparison between the two methods yields three constraints

on the parameters, which remove the spurious components from the Hamiltonian of [20]. A comparison

with the boson-realization model of [23] shows that this model corresponds to the harmonic limit of the

present approach.

The predictability has been tested by systematically adding levels with higher number of quanta in

the ﬁtting procedure. The slow variation in the parameters shows that the model has a high degree

of predictability. The application to methane [18] and to other molecules [15, 16, 17] suggest that the

present model provides a numerically eﬃcient tool to study molecular vibrations with high precision

(r.m.s. deviations of

1 cm−1).

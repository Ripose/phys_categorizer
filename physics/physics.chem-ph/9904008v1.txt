Abstract

A ρn

The long-time behavior of a reaction-diﬀusion front between one static (e.g. porous solid)
reactant A and one initially separated diﬀusing reactant B is analyzed for the mean-ﬁeld reaction-
rate density R(ρA, ρB) = kρm
B. A uniformly-valid asymptotic approximation is constructed
tβ enters
from matched self-similar solutions in a “reaction front” (of width w
t1/2 where R is negligible). The
the dominant balance) and a “diﬀusion layer” (of width W
limiting solution exists if and only if m, n
1, in which case the scaling exponents are uniquely
1)/2(m + 1) and β = m/(m + 1). In the diﬀusion layer, the common ad hoc
given by α = (m
approximation of neglecting reactions is given mathematical justiﬁcation, and the exact transient
decay of the reaction rate is derived. The physical eﬀects of higher-order kinetics (m, n > 1), such
as the broadening of the reaction front and the slowing of transients, are also discussed.

Introduction

In the decade that has passed since the pioneering analytical study of G´alﬁ and R´acz [1], there has
emerged a substantial body of research devoted to experimental [2], computational [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
and analytical [11, 12] studies of reaction-diﬀusion systems with two initially separated, diﬀusing
species A and B reacting to produce an inert product C according to the chemical formula

m′A + n′B

where m′ and n′, the stoichiometric coeﬃcients, are positive integers. Theoretical studies have
focused almost exclusively on the “one-dimensional” case of an inﬁnite, ﬂat reaction front between
two regions of homogeneous composition of either A or B (see Fig. 1). This idealized situation is
believed to capture much of the essential physics of reaction fronts commonly observed in various
chemical [14, 15] and biological [16, 17] systems.

The standard continuum model for such a one-dimensional reaction front involves a pair of

nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations [1, 5, 12]

and B, respectively, ρo
B > 0 are constants, H(X) is the Heaviside unit step function
and R(ρA, ρB) is the reaction rate density for production of species C. The reactants are completely
separated at ﬁrst according to Eq. (4), but for T > 0 they diﬀuse together and react, which decreases
the concentrations wherever ρA(X, T )ρB(X, T ) > 0. Diﬀusion acts to replenish any depleted regions.
As a result the system develops a localized, moving region, the “reaction front,” where the reaction
rate R(ρA, ρB) is greatest and which is fed by diﬀusion from the distant particle reservoirs described
by the boundary conditions. The dynamics of this reaction front are described by the long-time
asymptotics of the nonlinear initial-boundary-value problem, Eqs. (2)–(4).

The nonlinear reaction term R(ρA, ρB) is usually assumed to have the form of a power-law

monomial,

where k is a rate constant, and m and n are respectively the “kinetic orders” of A and B in the
reaction [15]. For a one-step reaction with suﬃcient mixing (see below) m = m′ and n = n′, but for
more complex, multi-step reactions m and n are determined by the stoichiometric coeﬃcients of the
(often unknown) rate-limiting step [15]. Although m and n are usually taken to be positive integers,
non-integer values of m and n can arise in certain situations [15]. We will see that a well-deﬁned
reaction front exists for any real numbers m, n

1, but not for m < 1 or n < 1.

Technically, by assuming in (2) that the reaction rate R depends only on the average local
concentrations (and not on any ﬂuctuations or many-body eﬀects) we have made the “mean-ﬁeld
approximation” [18]. In low-dimensional systems, such as ion channels (d = 1) or catalytic surfaces
(d = 2), the mean-ﬁeld approximation can break down because the reacting particles cannot mix
eﬃciently enough, but as the dimension of the system is increased above a certain “upper critical
dimension” dc, such statistical anomalies disappear. For two diﬀusing reactants with a simple one-
step reaction it is known [5, 8, 18] that dc = 2/(m + n
1 the mean-ﬁeld
approximation should be perfectly valid in the usual case d = 3, which is consistent with experimental
ﬁndings [2].

In contrast to the case of two diﬀusing reactants described above, relatively little is known [4, 8, 13]
about the case of one diﬀusing reactant (DA > 0) and one static reactant (DB = 0). This situation,
depicted schematically in Fig. 1, describes the corrosion of a porous solid B saturated with a ﬂuid
solvent and exposed to an initially separated colloidal reactant A, as shown in recent electrochemical
experiments (described below)
[3]. Jiang and Ebner [4] ﬁrst pointed out (for m = n = 1) that
setting DB = 0 in (2) is a non-trivial, i.e. singular, limit leading to diﬀerent long-time behavior
than in the case of ﬁnite DB > 0 (no matter how small), which they explained with simple scaling
arguments supported by Monte Carlo computer simulations. For an analytical description of such
one-dimensional diﬀusion with one static reactant, we adopt the power-law form of the reaction term
and study the coupled equations

In the simplest case m = n = 1, the initial-boundary-value problem (3)–(6) has been solved numeri-
cally by Havlin et al. [8] and analyzed in the limit T
by Koza [13], but the eﬀect of varying the
reaction orders has not been studied to our knowledge. Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of
the solutions not been established, and the previous analysis relies on various ad hoc approximations.
The relevance of (6) for a given porous-solid corrosion system rests on several key assumptions
that are less obviously satisﬁed a priori than in the case of two diﬀusing reactants. First, the solid
matrix containing the static reactant B must be suﬃciently porous that the moving reactant A can
diﬀuse freely to the exposed surfaces with an eﬀective diﬀusion constant (averaged over many pores)
comparable to that in the bulk solvent. The concentration of A must also be dilute enough that
DA is constant. Another reason that the concentrations of A and B must be dilute is that the inert
product C must be created in small enough quantities that its presence does not aﬀect the reaction
dynamics (e.g. by inhibiting diﬀusion or initiating convection). Finally, one might worry about the
breakdown of the mean-ﬁeld approximation since the (possibly fractal) pore structure may inﬂuence
statistical averaging. For example, it is known that ﬂuctuations alter the reaction-front dynamics
when the diﬀusion is conﬁned to a percolating cluster in two dimensions [8]. In spite of these concerns,
however, the one-dimensional mean-ﬁeld model (6) can in fact describe certain corrosion systems.

An important motivation for the present analytical study is aﬀorded by the recent experiments of
L´eger et al. [3], which are the ﬁrst to examine the case of one static and one diﬀusing reactant. These
experiments involve the corrosion of ramiﬁed copper electrodeposits exposed to a cupric chloride
electrolyte to produce cuprous chloride crystallites via the reaction

immediately following electrodeposition. It is found that the long-time behavior of (6) with m =
1 matches the experimentally observed front speed and concentration proﬁle of diﬀusing reactant
(CuCl2) rather well, in spite of the complex fractal geometry of the electrodeposits and the presence
of the inert product (CuCl) [3]. Since the reaction rate and the concentration of the static species
(Cu) are not directly measured, however, the interpretation of these kinds of corrosion experiments
can be aided by the analysis presented here of the mean-ﬁeld model with m, n

but much less rigorous analysis has been reported for coupled equations like (2) owing to their
greater complexity. In the case of two diﬀusing reactants, G´alﬁ and R´acz [1] pointed out that if the
ρB obeys a
diﬀusion constants are the same, DA = DB, then the diﬀerence in concentrations ρA −

a single equation with the form of (8). Another simpliﬁcation occurs if also ρo
B in which case
the reaction front is perfectly symmetric and does not move. In this simpliﬁed case with m = n = 1,
Schenkel et al. [11] were able to prove that the similarity solution of G´alﬁ and R´acz [1] is approached
starting from the initial conditions of (4), and they also reported rigorous
uniformly as T
bounds on the transient decay to the asymptotic solution.

The analysis of Schenkel et al. [11] represents a major contribution because, at least in the
case DA = DB, ρo
B and m = n = 1, it provides a rigorous mathematical justiﬁcation for
various ad hoc assumptions introduced by G´alﬁ and R´acz [1, 12] which have otherwise been validated
only by numerical simulations. Unfortunately, however, since their analysis relies on a comparison
principle [19] for single parabolic equations of the form of Eq. (8), it does not appear to be applicable
= DB. Schenkel et al. also remark that it would be diﬃcult to extend their analysis to
when DA 6

higher-order reactions (m, n > 1) due to the broadening of the reaction front. These diﬃculties are
reﬂected in Koza’s recent studies of the general cases DA > DB > 0 [12] and DB = 0 [13], in which
several ad hoc (but reasonable) approximations are made and transients are ignored.

In the present article, the long-time asymptotics of the initial-boundary-value problem (3)–(6)
are studied. This special case of (2) is more tractable analytically than the general case because
(6b) can be integrated exactly in time, thereby reducing the coupled system to a single integro-
partial-diﬀerential equation. This useful simpliﬁcation is presented in section 2 where the problem is
recast in a dimensionless form. It is also noted that similarity solutions are expected to exist because
there is no natural length or time scale in the problem [20, 21, 22]. Although it may be possible to
prove that the system actually approaches such a self-similar solution starting from the prescribed
initial conditions, we instead pursue the more modest goal of proving that if an asymptotic similarity
solution exists, it must have a certain unique form, i.e. we explore the consequences of the “quasi-
stationary approximation” [5, 12, 13]. In section 3, the similarity solution is systematically derived,
and it is shown that a “diﬀusion layer” (where the reaction term is dominated by the diﬀusion
term) with diﬀerent scaling properties than the “reaction-front” (where the reaction and diﬀusion
terms balance) must exist to satisfy the boundary conditions. In section 4, the transient decay of
the reaction rate in the diﬀusion layer is analyzed, thereby proving a posteriori that the reaction
term can indeed be neglected in the dominant balance. In section 5, a uniformly-valid, asymptotic
approximation is constructed by matching the self-similar forms in the two diﬀerent regions. Finally,
in section 6 some general physical conclusions suggested by the analysis are discussed. (Note that
section 4 is more technical and may be skipped in a ﬁrst reading.)

Note that (10b) and (10d) imply that b(x, t) = 0 for x > 0 at all times t

that species B cannot diﬀuse out of its initial region. For x < 0, we integrate (10b) using the initial

2.3 A Reaction Front Does Not Exist if n < 1

Consider any point xo < 0. Since species A diﬀuses to xo from a reservoir of constant concentration
(a(
, t) = 1) while species B is removed by reactions without ever being replenished (∂b(xo, t)/∂t < 0
for all t > 0), it is clear that after long times a(xo, t) must eventually diﬀer from zero. Therefore, there
exists some ao(xo) > 0 and to > 0 such that a(xo, t) > ao(xo) for all t > to. From (13), this implies
φm(xo, t) > am
to) since xo < 0 and q > 0. Examining (12), the fact that φm(xo, t) eventually
0, but a singularity arises if n < 1: The
increases (at least linearly) in time implies that b(xo, t)
concentration of static reactant b(x0, t) vanishes at some ﬁnite time t1 given by q(1
n)φm(xo, t1) = 1
(which exists because φ(xo, t) is continuous, φm(xo, 0) = 0 and φm(xo,
). For t > t1, Eq. (12)
predicts imaginary, negative, or diverging (and possibly negative) solutions for n < 1, none of which
are physically meaningful. Therefore, when n < 1, the solutions to the model equations break down
physically (if not also mathematically) in ﬁnite time, and in that sense there does not exist a stable,
moving reaction front.

3 Derivation of the Asymptotic Similarity Solution

3.1 Scaling of the Reaction Front

The initial-boundary-value problem (10) possesses no natural length or time scale, i.e. it is invariant
under power-law “stretching transformations” [22], and consequently in the limit t
the system
is expected to approach an asymptotic similarity solution in which distance and time are coupled
by power-law scalings [20, 21]. Since reactant A diﬀuses while reactant B does not, the (presumably

→ ∞

unique) point of maximal reaction rate r(a, b) = ambn moves in the
x direction toward the reservoir
of reactant B. Therefore, an asymptotic similarity solution, if one exists, must involve a moving frame
of reference centered on some point xf (t) identifying the position of the reaction front at or near the
2νtσ, where ν(q) > 0 is a constant
point of maximal reaction rate (with dxf /dt < 0). Let xf (t) =
(akin to the “speed” of the front) to be determined self-consistently during the analysis, and consider
an arbitrary coordinate stretching transformation in the moving reference frame,

where w(t) = tα is the width of the reaction front indicated in Fig. 1. (The factor of two is included
only for algebraic convenience.)

In the neighborhood of xf (t), we also allow the magnitude of a(x, t) to vary with a power-law

scaling,

If γ
= 0, then another similarity solution far away from the reaction front (in the “diﬀusion layer”
, t) = 1.
shown in Fig. 1 and deﬁned below) will be needed to satisfy the boundary condition a(
This possibility that two regions with diﬀerent asymptotically self-similar dynamics for a(x, t) could
arise is suggested by the fact that there are two driving terms, representing diﬀusion and reaction, on
the right-hand side of (10a) with diﬀerent behaviors under stretching transformations. On the other
hand, there is only the reaction term on the right-hand side of Eq. (10b), so b(x, t) can exhibit only
one type of asymptotic scale invariance. This is the main mathematical consequence of the physical
fact that reactant B does not diﬀuse. Since b(

In the ﬁrst case, we have σ

front xf ∼
the scaling behavior. The same conclusion is also true of the reaction order m of the diﬀusing species

In this way, we are forced to consider at least two regions with diﬀerent scale invariance if there
is to be any hope of an asymptotic similarity solution. Since the second type of scale invariance
is associated with the dominance of the diﬀusion term versus the reaction term in (10a), it must
occur only on the back (+x) side of the reaction front due to the reservoir of reactant A at inﬁnity,
a(
, t) = 1 (see Fig. 1). To describe the scale invariance of the diﬀusion layer, we postulate another
power law W (t) = tδ for the asymptotic width of the diﬀusion layer.

3.2 Scaling of the Diﬀusion Layer

Since δ

= α, there are two possibilities, each involving a singular perturbation w/W = tα−δ:

Inﬁnitely Thin Reaction Front Case: δ > α, w = o(W )

Inﬁnitely Thin Diﬀusion Layer Case: δ < α, W = o(w).

Since chemical reactions are typically much faster than diﬀusion, the former case seems more rea-
sonable on physical grounds, but we do not rule out the latter case a priori. In the Inﬁnitely Thin
xf = O(w) and the diﬀusion layer by
Reaction Front Case, the reaction front is deﬁned by x
xf ), x > xf , whereas in the Inﬁnitely Thin Diﬀusion Layer Case, the reaction front is
W = O(x
xf = O(W ). In both cases, we view
deﬁned by w = O(x

3.3 Asymptotic Matching of the Reaction Front and Diﬀusion Layer

One more condition is needed to uniquely determine the scaling exponents, and it comes from
asymptotic matching: The “outer limit” η
of the inner approximation must match with the
0+ of the outer approximation (because both are asymptotic representations
“inner limit” ζ
of the same function). Unlike the more familiar case of boundary layers of ordinary diﬀerential
equations [23, 24], however, our system of partial diﬀerential equations will require extra care for
matching because the limit t
(with either ζ or η ﬁxed) must be taken before the inner and
outer limits.

Since B(ζ) = 0 for all ζ > 0, the only matching condition for b(x, t) is trivial,

) = 0, but
the matching conditions for a(x, t) are more subtle. Since γ > 0, the concentration of species A
approaches 0 in the reaction front: a(x, t) = O(t−γ) as t
ﬁxed. Therefore, a
boundary condition on the outer problem is A(ζ) = 0, but unfortunately this does not provide a
boundary condition on the inner problem. Instead, we must consider matching at the next (linear)
order of Taylor expansion in the intermediate region:

Therefore, after long times the reaction front itself “diﬀuses” according to xf (t) =
ν(q)2 is now interpreted as an eﬀective diﬀusion constant for the front. Although for m = 1 the
reaction zone settles down to a constant width (α = 0), for m > 1 the front width grows in time
(α > 0). In all cases the reaction front is “inﬁnitely thin” compared to the diﬀusion layer (α < δ).
Note that as m increases, γ tends to zero, meaning that the concentration in the reaction front does
not decrease as quickly for higher-order reactions as it does for ﬁrst-order reactions. The exponents
α = 0 and γ = 1/2 for the case m = 1 were ﬁrst predicted by Jiang and Ebner [4] based on physical
arguments supported by Monte Carlo simulations and later discussed in an analytical context by

Koza [13], but to our knowledge prior to this work neither have the general expressions for m
been given nor have the scaling exponents been proven to be unique. With the scaling exponents and
matching boundary conditions now determined, we proceed to solve the inner and outer boundary-
value problems in the following sections.

By comparing (19) and (42), some physical insight into the dynamics of the reaction front is
gained. The concentration of diﬀusing reactant A is determined by a local balance of reactions and
“steady state” diﬀusion and the concentration of static reactant B by a local balance of reactions
and ﬁctitious advection due to the translating reference frame. The latter balance reﬂects the special
character of DB = 0: Since reactant B cannot diﬀuse to the front, instead the front must diﬀuse
to it. This is no longer true if DB > 0 (no matter how small), which explains why diﬀerent scaling
exponents arise in that case [1, 4]. These physical properties are manifested in the mathematical
model by the fact that since it multiplies the highest derivative in the equations DB > 0 is a singular
perturbation.

Let us brieﬂy consider trajectories in the lower half-plane (v < 0) in the neighborhood of the ﬁxed
point (u
1). Of course, such trajectories are not physically allowed, but it is satisfying to prove
that the model equations exclude such possibilities. If m is either irrational or a rational number
of the irreducible form k1/k2 where k2 is even, then such trajectories do not exist because in that
case vm (and hence u′) would not be a real number. If m = k1/k2 where k1 is even and k2 is odd,
then the direction ﬁeld (u′, v′) is an even function of v, which in light of (53) implies that there are
no other separatrices in the lower half-plane and that trajectories merely circle the ﬁxed point, as
shown in Fig. 4(b). Finally, if m = k1/k2 where both k1 and k2 are odd, then u′ is an odd function
of v (while v′ is even), and (1, 0) is a saddle point. In this case, Eq. (53) also describes separatrices
in the lower half-plane with the lower sign corresponding to the stable manifold and the upper to
the unstable manifold, as shown in Fig. 4(c). As it leaves the ﬁxed point, this branch of the unstable
manifold enters the region (u > 1, v < 0), throughout which u′ > 0 and v′ < 0, and thus it heads
oﬀ to u = v =
and cannot satisfy the other boundary condition, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (c).
Therefore, any solutions must lie entirely in the ﬁrst quadrant of the phase plane (u > 0, v > 0).

−∞

In this way we are left with only one possible solution, which leaves the ﬁxed point along the
unstable manifold of Eq. (53) and enters the region deﬁned by 0 < u < 1 and v > 0, throughout
which u′ < 0 and v′ > 0. Since the v-axis (u = 0) is itself a trajectory, which cannot be crossed, this

Assumption (i) states that two spatial regions with disparate length scales, the reaction front and
the diﬀusion layer, arise where the reaction term on the right-hand side of the governing partial
integro-diﬀerential equation (14) or (15) is, respectively, either comparable to or dominated by the
diﬀusion term. Assumption (ii) states that, when viewed on scales appropriate for each region, the
solution to the initial-boundary-value problem (10) approaches an asymptotically self-similar form,
which is suggested by the fact that there is no natural length scale in the problem.

These ubiquitous assumptions [1, 12, 13] have been rigorously justiﬁed by Schenkel et al. [11]
only in the special case of a perfectly symmetric (DA = DB, ρo
B), and thus stationary (ν = 0),
reaction front involving two diﬀusing reactants with ﬁrst-order kinetics (m = n = 1). To our
knowledge, a similar mathematical validation of these assumptions has not been given for the general
situation of a moving reaction front with higher-order kinetics for either one or two diﬀusing reactants.
In the present case (DB = 0), we will show that quasi-stationarity implies scale separation,
i.e.
(It suﬃces to show (65b) since (65) follows from the deﬁnition of η in
section 3.1.) The same analysis will also reveal the transient decay to the asymptotic similarity
solution in the diﬀusion layer. These results provide a mathematical justiﬁcation for the assumption
of scale separation in a fairly general and nontrivial situation (DB = 0, ν > 0, m, n

(66) implies (65).

A = ρo

We begin by precisely stating our assumptions related to (66). From (66a) and its consequence
(62a), we conclude that the diﬀusing reactant concentration vanishes on the scale W (t) = √t ahead
of the front (where there is no diﬀusion layer) since ˜A(ζ, t)
with
ζ < 0 ﬁxed. This result can be combined with (27a) to obtain a statement of quasi-stationarity on
the scale W (t):

equation. Throughout section 4 our only assumptions about A(ζ) are A(0) = 0 and A′(0) > 0.

already established (71) for ζ > ν since ˜B(ζ, t) vanishes there identically for all times. Therefore, it

reactant concentration in the diﬀusion layer, the reaction order n could in principle be inferred from
experimental data (although such measurements are diﬃcult in practice [3]).

4.5 The Decay Time When n = 1

Since the reaction term vanishes suﬃciently fast in the diﬀusion layer to justify a posteriori the
analysis in section 3, the exact expression for A(ζ) from (36) may be substituted into (77) to evaluate

n = 1, however, then fm(ζ) sets the characteristic time τm(ζ)−1

which is easier to measure experimentally. Therefore, we now derive an exact expression for the
decay time τ1(ζ) (0 < ζ

5 Uniformly-Valid Asymptotic Approximations

In the previous two sections we have argued for the existence of a unique asymptotic similarity
solution (up to an unknown constant ηo) contingent upon certain “quasi-stationarity” conditions,
which are likely to be satisﬁed for the speciﬁed initial conditions (see below). This solution, valid after

18

long times, consists of two diﬀerent asymptotic approximations for a(x, t), the concentration of the
diﬀusing reactant A, which reﬂect the diﬀerent couplings of length and time in the reaction front and
the diﬀusion layer. A single asymptotic approximation for a(x, t) that is uniformly valid across all
space is obtained by adding the two contributions from the reaction front (the inner region) and the
diﬀusion layer (the outer region) and subtracting the overlap (from the intermediate region) [23, 24]:

Also, ν(q)2 is the diﬀusion constant of the reaction front (see (45) and Fig. 3);
A1 = ν(q)/q is a
constant proportional to the diﬀusive ﬂux entering the front;
(η) is the reaction-front similarity
function (see (59a) and Fig. 5); A(ζ) is the diﬀusion-layer similarity function (see (36) and Fig. 2); and
ηo is an undetermined constant depending upon the initial conditions as well as the precise deﬁnition
of the reaction-front location. The uniform approximation has been determined analytically up to
the solution of two algebraic equations (59) and one quadrature (60).

A

A subtle point in the construction of this uniformly-valid approximation is that shifting the
ηo does not aﬀect matching with the diﬀusion layer because in
position of the front by η
ηt−1/(m+1)/2 = ζ. In other words, because the reaction-front
that case ζ
is “inﬁnitely thin” compared to the diﬀusion layer, translating its similarity variable by a constant
ηo, or any other function of time that is o(t1/2), does not require that the diﬀusion-layer similarity
variable ζ be shifted as well.

The situation for b(x, t), the concentration of the static reactant B, is much simpler. By comparing
the asymptotic bound on b(x, t) in the diﬀusion layer given by Eq. (79) with the tail of the reaction-
front approximation given by Eq. (63a) with η = 2ζt1/(m+1), we see that that the asymptotic behavior
of b(x, t) is identical in the two regions. Therefore,

all initial conditions for which r(x, 0) has compact support, e.g. r(x, 0) = 0 for x

or exponential decay, e.g. r(x, 0) < M e−|x|/xo for some M, xo > 0, but perhaps not slower power-law
decay.

6 Discussion

In this article we have studied the long-time asymptotics of solutions to the initial-boundary-value
problem of (3)–(6), which is a generic mean-ﬁeld model for the corrosion of a porous solid by a

diﬀusing chemical. We have derived a uniformly valid asymptotic approximation (82)–(84) consisting
of matched similarity solutions in two distinct regions, the reaction front and diﬀusion layer, each
possessing diﬀerent power-law scaling behavior. The existence and uniqueness of the similarity
functions and the scaling exponents have been established if and only if m, n
1, and through
an analysis of transients in the diﬀusion layer the asymptotic scale separation has been shown to
follow from the assumption of quasi-stationarity. Since quasi-stationarity has been observed in recent
experiments on the corrosion of ramiﬁed electrodeposits [3], the present analysis therefore suﬃces to
establish the theoretical predictions of the mean-ﬁeld equations for at least one particular corrosion

system. Although the case considered here (m, n

the case DA = DB 6
mathematical justiﬁcation for the scale separation between the diﬀusion layer and reaction front.

≥

In this work we have paid special attention to the eﬀect of higher-order reactions (m, n > 1).
First of all, the scaling exponents vary with the reaction order m of the diﬀusing reactant in precisely
the same way as they do on the sum m + n in the case of two diﬀusing reactants [5], as shown in
Table 1. Moreover, the spatial localization of the reaction rate r(a, b) on each side of the front
depends primarily on the reaction order of the depleted reactant: As the appropriate reaction order
is increased from unity, the spatial dependence of the reaction rate away from the front changes
from an exponential decay to a progressively broader power-law decay. Similarly, the temporal
decay of the depleted (static) reactant concentration in the diﬀusion layer depends sensitively on
its reaction order, undergoing a another transition from exponential to power-law decay (in time)
as n is increased from unity. These properties may have general relevance for more complicated
multi-component reaction-diﬀusion systems.

Other qualitiative features of our analysis that might have more general applicability are the
dominant balances in the reaction front. There, the concentration of a diﬀusing reactant is determined
by a balance between reactions and “steady state” diﬀusion, i.e. a mobile species diﬀuses slowly to
the front where it immediately reacts. On the other hand, the concentration of a static reactant is
determined by a balance between reactions and ﬁctitous advection due to the moving reference frame,
i.e. since the static species cannot diﬀuse to the front, the front must diﬀuse to it. These guiding
principles might help simplify more complicated reaction-diﬀusion equations for which asymptotically
self-similar solutions do not exist.

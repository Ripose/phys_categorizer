Abstract

Partitioning and transport of water and small solutes into and through nanopores is important to a variety

of chemical and biological processes and applications. Here we study water structure in negatively charged

model cylindrical [carbon nanotube (CNT)-like] nanopores as well as the partitioning of positive ions of

increasing size (N a+, K +, and Cs+) into the pore interior using extensive molecular dynamics simula-

tions. Despite the simplicity of the simulation system – containing a short CNT-like nanopore in water

carrying a uniformly distributed charge of qpore = −ne surrounded by n (= 0, . . . , 8) cations, making the

overall system charge-neutral – the results provide new and useful insights on both the pore hydration and

ion partitioning. For n = 0, that is, for a neutral nanopore, water molecules partition into the pore and form

single-ﬁle hydrogen-bonded wire spanning the pore length. With increasing n, water molecules enter the

pore from both ends with preferred orientations, resulting in a mutual repulsion between oriented waters at

the pore center, and creating a cavity-like low density region at the center. For low negative charge densities

on the pore, the driving force for partitioning of positive ions into the pore is weak, and no partitioning is

observed. Increasing the pore charge gradually leads to partitioning of positive ions into the pore. Inter-

estingly, over a range of intermediate negative charge densities, nanopores display both thermodynamic as

well as kinetic selectivity toward partitioning of the larger K + and Cs+ ions into their interior over the

smaller N a+ ions. Speciﬁcally, the driving force is in the order K + > Cs+ > N a+, and K + and Cs+

ions enter the pore much more rapidly than N a+ ions. At higher charge densities, the driving force for

partitioning increases for all cations – it is highest for K + ions, and becomes similar for N a+ and Cs+

ions. The variation of thermodynamic driving force and the average partitioning time with the pore charge

density together suggest the presence of free energy barriers in the partitioning process. We discuss the

role of ion hydration in the bulk and in the pore interior as well as of the pore hydration in determining the

barrier heights for ion partitioning and the observed thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding thermodynamics and kinetics of partitioning of small molecules into nanoscopic

pores or conﬁned spaces of molecular dimensions is important to a wide range of chemical and

biological processes and applications [1, 2, 3, 4]. The pores of interest can be smooth cylindrical

(carbon nanotube-like) [5] or slit-pores (between ﬂat surfaces) [6], or may have complex geome-

tries as observed in biological pores [7, 8], in activated carbon, and in other nanoporous materials

[9]. When exposed to solution, such materials can selectively extract and/or allow transport of spe-

ciﬁc solute molecules into and through their pores, depending on the pore-solvent, pore-solute, and

solute-solvent interactions. Successful bottom-up design of such selective systems can be aided

by fundamental understanding of the interplay of these interactions in idealized model systems.

Molecular dynamics simulations are an excellent tool to build and simulate such model systems

aimed at fumdamental understanding.

Here we are interested in partitioning of simple spherically symmetric ionic solutes into interior

of charged hollow cylindrical pores of well deﬁned dimensions in the nanometer range. Such a

model system is relevant not only to electrostatically driven molecular separations or nanoﬂuidic

applications, but also to development of energy storage devices, such as carbon supercapacitors,

that use ion adsorption on the surface of highly porous materials to store charge. A recent exper-

imental study by Chmiola et al. [10] shows that carbide-derived carbon materials with pore sizes

from 0.6 to 2.25 nm when used as a negative electrode, can partition tetraethylammonium cations

(∼0.68 nm in diameter) into the pore. The closer approach of partially dehydrated cations to the

nanoporous electrode surface leads to signiﬁcantly enhanced capacitance of these materials.

Our simulation system contains a nanopore (modeled by a carbon nanotube-like cylindri-

cal pore) in water carrying a uniformly distributed charge of qpore = −ne surrounded by n
(= 0, . . . , 8) cations (either Na+, K +, or Cs+), making the overall system charge-neutral. We

perform extensive nonequilibrium simulations focused on the kinetics of partitioning, which show
that negatively charged nanopores can be selective toward partitioning of the larger K + and Cs+
ions and can exclude the smaller Na+ ions over a range of nanopore charge densities. We com-

plement those simulations with equilibrium free energy calculations of ion hydration in bulk water

and in the hydrated nanopore interior. These calculations along with analysis of ion hydration

shell ﬂuctuations highlight the role of free energy barriers as well as equilibrium free energy of

partitioning which together are expected to govern the rate of ion transport through selective pores.

II. SIMULATION DETAILS

Simulations of ion partitioning into nanopores: We used a piece of (5,5) armchair carbon nan-

otube (CNT)-like pore comprising 100 carbons [with the pore diameter (i.e., C-C distance) of 6.7
˚A and length 11 ˚A] as a model cylindrical pore. A total charge of qpore = −ne (where e is the

magnitude of electronic charge) was distributed uniformly on the pore atoms, such that each atom

carries a charge of -ne/100. The nanopore was placed in a solution containing 500 explicit water

molecules and n cations, thus, making the overall system electrically neutral. Note that our goal

is not to model speciﬁcally a CNT, but use its cylindrical geometry as a model for a cylindrical

pore. A realistic model of CNT would need to consider the chemistry of rim atoms, non-uniform

distribution of charges (in case of charged nanotubes) [11], etc.

The present systems contain n cations, but no explicit anions (the pore with its −ne charge

acts as a large anion). In realistic systems, anions (e.g., chloride ions) will be present in the salt

solution. For n = 5, we simulated the present system with excess salt (i.e., with additional few

pairs of NaCl, KCl, or CsCl) ions. The results on partitioning of cations in this system were

similar to the ones reported here, suggesting that the trends on partitioning reported here will be

unaffected.

Simulations were performed using AMBER6.0 [12], using TIP3P [13] model of water, and

Lennard Jonesium (LJ) description of carbon (atom type CA) [12, 14]. Ions were represented as
LJ spheres with ion charge placed at the center [15]: σN a = 2.530 ˚A, ǫN a = 0.06184 kJ/mol,
σK = 5.874 ˚A, ǫK = 0.0000568 kJ/mol, and σCs = 6.0492 ˚A, ǫCs = 0.0003372 kJ/mol. Ion-

water and ion-carbon LJ interactions were calculated using Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules [16].

Periodic boundary conditions were applied and the particle mesh Ewald method [17] was used to

calculate the electrostatic interactions with a grid spacing of 1 ˚A. Temperature and pressure were

maintained at 300 K and 1 atm, respectively, using the Berendsen method [18]. A time step of 1

fs was used in all the simulations.

Selective partitioning of cations into nanopores: A given system contains a carbon nanotube-

like pore carrying a total charge of qpore = −ne, water, and n cations. We monitored the number of

cations partitioned into the nanopore as a function of time for different values of n (see Figure 1).

Separate simulations were performed for qpore = −1e through −8e in steps of 1e, for each cation.
At the beginning of each production run (marked t = 0), each cation in the system was at least 9 ˚A

away from the atoms of the model nanopore. To obtain an estimate of the partitioning time (or the

4

ﬁrst passage time for partitioning), each simulation was run for a sufﬁciently long time. For lower

charge densities on the nanopore, the electrostatic driving force is low, and extended simulations

of neutral and near neutral (qpore = −1e) nanopores show that ions are excluded from the pore

interior, consistent with previous studies [19, 20, 21]. For higher charge densities on the pore, not

only is the electrostatic driving force higher, but the ion concentration outside the tube is slightly

higher as well (by the way the system is constructed), which likely further increases the driving

force. Thus, with increasing n we expect ions to partition into the pore, with the time required for

partitioning decreasing with the pore charge density. Correspondingly, for |qpore| ≥ 2e simulations

were performed for 24/n nanoseconds each.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Kinetics of ion partitioning: Figure 1 shows the number of cations partitioned into the pore

for various charge states of the pore observed in different nonequilibrium simulation runs. For

qpore = −2e, the charge density on the nanopore is sufﬁciently small and none of the ions partitions

into the pore over the timescale of 12 ns. It is only for qpore = −5e we observe partitioning of one
Na+ ion into the pore in the speciﬁc set of runs shown in Figure 1. In contrast, Cs+ and K + ions

partition into the pore for |qpore| ≥ 3e. At higher values of |qpore|, we observe partitioning of the
second and third (in case of K +) cation into the charged nanopore. To obtain more quantitative

estimates of the kinetics of partitioning, we performed 10 independent nonequilibrium simulations

for each ion type starting with different initial conﬁguration for qpore = −4e, −5e, and − 6e.

Each of these simulations were run until the ﬁrst cation partitions well into the pore, which for
qpore = −4e was longer than 25-30 ns each for several runs with Na+ ions. We deﬁne τ1 as

the waiting time for the ﬁrst cation to partition into the nanopore. Table I lists average, hτ1i, and

standard deviation, στ1, of the waiting time distribution obtained from 10 simulations. Although

a larger number of simulations may be needed to obtain more accurate estimates of waiting time

distributions, trends in our data are already clear and interesting. For example, for qpore = −4e,
Na+ ion takes ∼25 times longer to partition into the pore (∼18 ns) compared to that for K + and
Cs+ ions (∼0.7-0.8 ns). As the charge on the nanopore is increased, partitioning of Na+ occurs
over shorter timescales, and correspondingly, the τ1 values for both K + and Cs+ ions are small

and decrease somewhat further. Thus, from kinetic perspective, over a range of charge densities,
the nanopore is selective toward partitioning of the larger ions K + and Cs+ over the smaller ion

5

Na+, and increasing the driving force signiﬁcantly (i.e., increasing |qpore|) appears to decrease

that selectivity somewhat. To understand the ion partitioning at a more fundamental level, we

investigate below the structural and thermodynamic aspects of the partitioning process.

Water structure in neutral and charged pores: Filling and emptying transitions of water into

neutral nanotubes have been studied previously [2, 22]. For the carbon-water LJ parameters used

here, water molecules partition into the tube and form a single-ﬁle hydrogen bonded wire, in which

each water molecule donates and accepts one hydrogen bond to and from its neighbors on the left

and right (Figure 2a). The length of the tube is such that only four water molecules completely ﬁt

inside the tube. However, the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the boundary water molecules with

those inside the tube are sufﬁciently strong. As a result, one water molecule on each side of the

tube also maintains its position and orientation consistent with those in the tube. Correspondingly,

the water density proﬁle along the tube axis shows six clearly deﬁned peaks (Figure 2b).

Water molecules in the hydrogen-bonded wire have one of their OH bond vectors aligned ap-

proximately with the pore axis and pointing in the positive Z direction. Properties of such hydro-

gen bonded wires have been studied especially for their ability to transport protons at fast rates

[23]. The dipole vector OM of each water molecule makes an angle of ∼35 degrees with the pore

axis [hcosθi ≈ 0.82] (Figure 2c). We note that the mirror image of the chain with all OH vectors

pointing in the negative Z direction is equally likely due to two-fold symmetry [22].

The effects of charging the nanopore on the structure of water inside the pore are interesting.

For qpore = −2e, that is, when the charge on each carbon is −0.02e, water molecules enter the

pore with both of their hydrogen atoms pointing inward and the HOH planes roughly parallel to the

pore axis (Figure 2a) [22]. As the chains from the two ends meet at the center, there is signiﬁcant

electrostatic repulsion between them. As a result, water density is depressed at the center of the

pore as indicated by the signiﬁcant reduction in the heights of the two central peaks (Figure 2b).

Water is effectively expelled from that region, creating a molecular scale void or a cavity. This

expulsion in similar to that observed recently in simulations of charged plates in water [24]. The

other peaks are also less well deﬁned. As the charge on the nanopore is increased, the stronger

water-nanopore interactions lead to a partial ﬁlling of the internal cavity. In the interior of these

charged nanopores, water molecules ﬂip the orientation as we traverse the pore from left to right

as indicated by the hcosθi proﬁle (Figure 2c). A similar change in orientation of water molecules

is observed in the aquaporin protein channel, which has positively charged regions at the opening

and the exit to block transport of protons [7, 25].

6

The low density region at the center of a charged pore is only a few angstroms wide and presents

an ideal location for cations partitioned into the pore. The lower water density in the cation sized

region ensures lower repulsive interactions without the loss of attractive interactions with vicinal

waters. Indeed, analysis of density distribution of cations conﬁrms that the most favorable po-

sition for the partitioned cations is at the pore center. The cation-water electrostatic interactions

are strong and affect orientations of the vicinal waters. Figure 3 shows the effects of competi-

tive water-water, water-nanopore, and water-cation interactions on water orientations. When the
charge on the cation at the pore center is turned off, e.g., for K 0Pore−2e case, water orientations

are dictated solely by the water-nanopore electrostatic interactions. However, when the charge
on the potassium ion is turned on, i.e., for the K +1Pore−2e case, the water-potassium interactions

dominate and ﬂip the orientations of two vicinal water molecules such that their oxygens point to-
ward the K + ion. Interestingly, the repulsion between these two water molecules in ion’s shell and

others located at the pore ends leads to a low density area at the pore entry (see Figure 3c). When

the nanopore charge is increased to −5e, the water-nanopore interactions become comparable to
water-potassium interactions, and only the two water molecules vicinal to the K + ion point their

oxygens toward the ion, and the pore entry region gets ﬁlled again (Figure 3d).

Thermodynamics of ion partitioning: The free energy of ion transfer from bulk water to

nanopore interior quantiﬁes the thermodynamic driving force for ion partitioning. The excess
hyd, can be divided into two parts: µex

free energy of hydration, µex

ele, where µex

hyd = µex

LJ + µex

LJ is

the excess chemical potential of hydration of electrically neutral LJ solutes, and µex

ele is the free

energy of charging that solute to its ﬁnal charge state (+1e here). We used test particle insertions

[26, 27] of neutral LJ solutes in bulk water and at the center of a charged hydrated nanopore to

obtain the µex

LJ contribution. As described previously in detail [28, 29], calculation of the µex

ele was

done using the cumulant expansion method which requires two simulations, one in the uncharged

and another in the fully charged state of the solute in bulk water as well as in the nanopore in-

terior. Such calculations were performed for all three cations for nanopore charge of −2e, −5e,

and −8e. For reference, we also calculated µex

LJ and µex

ele contributions in a system containing a

charged nanopore in vacuum, in the absence of water molecules. Comparison of these values to

those in the hydrated nanopore systems provides insights into the role of water in ion solvation,

especially in the conﬁning pore interior region.

Table II lists values µex

with the ion size. This is expected because the µex

LJ is smallest (i.e., most favorable) for Na+ ion, and increases
LJ is dominated by repulsive interactions (or

the cavity formation process). Compared to that in bulk water, µex
LJ value in the interior of the
hydrated nanopore with −2e charge is smaller for Na+ ion (expected), somewhat higher for K +
ion, and almost doubles of the Cs+ ion (unexpected). This is surprising because we expect that

the presence of a low density region in the hydrated nanopore will reduce, and not increase the
LJ value for all ions. The trends become clear, however, when we consider µex
µex
ions in a nanopore in vacuum. They indicate that the interior pore of the (5,5) nanopore used here
is small; it is large enough to accommodate Na+ ion comfortably, but overlaps slightly with the
K + ion, and signiﬁcantly with the Cs+ ion.

LJ calculated for

The advantage arising from the presence of a cavity at the center of the hydrated nanopores

becomes clear when we compare the sum of µex

LJ in bulk water and in bare nanopore to that in
hydrated nanopore. For all ions, that value in hydrated nanopores is smaller than the sum of

bulk water and bare nanopore values. Only for the highest charge density on the nanopore, the

two approach each other as the central cavity gets gradually ﬁlled with water. Thus, based on

differences between µex
LJ in bulk water and in the hydrated nanopore, we would expect the hydrated
nanopore interior to be most favorable for the smallest Na+ ion and least favorable for the largest
Cs+ ion. This is contrary to the kinetic behavior observed in Figure 1. To understand the role of

electrostatic interactions and of hydration, below we focus on differences in µex

ele contribution for

the three ions.

Table II shows that in bulk water phase, µex

ele is large and negative (i.e., favorable) for all ions.
It is most favorable for Na+ ion, equal to -420 kJ/mol, and decreases in magnitude as the ion

size increases, consistent with previous calculations [30]. In vacuum, the electrostatic interaction

between cations and the negatively charged nanopore is highly favorable and is almost identical

for all ions. Minor differences in the energy values in vacuum arise due to slight differences in the

location of ions. Ions are placed at their most probable locations obtained from ion partitioning

data in the hydrated charged nanopores. The charging free energy of ions in the hydrated charged

nanopores is also large and negative. However, its magnitude is smaller than that in vacuum

calculations. In the charged and hydrated nanopore, water molecules from either side point their

hydrogen atoms toward the center. Charging of a neutral LJ solute located at the center to +1e

charge partially reorients those water molecules to more favorable ion-water conﬁgurations. This

effect can be viewed as “competitive solvation”, where the cation and the pore both compete for

8

the same water molecules for their solvation. As a result, although the net value of µex

ele for ion

solvation is negative, it is smaller in magnitude compared to that inside the nanopore in vacuum.

Sodium ion, with its small size, and higher charge density is able to ﬁt in, as well as orient vicinal

water molecules in the pore such that the overall reduction (compared to that in vacuum) is smaller

compared to that for potassium and cesium ions.

The sum, µex

ele, determines the overall driving force for ion partitioning into the
pore. The difference of ion hydration free energy in the hydrated nanopore interior and in bulk

hyd = µex

LJ + µex

water is the water-to-nanopore transfer free energy, and is listed in Table III as well as shown in

Figure 4 for different charge states of the nanopore. For qpore = −2e, the transfer free energy for

all ions is positive (unfavorable) consistent with the observation from Figure 1 that none of the ions
partitions into the pore over 12 ns timescale. For Na+ and K + ions, the electrostatic contribution

is unfavorable; that is, the overall ion-water-nanopore interactions do not compensate for the loss
of ion-water interactions in the bulk water. In contrast, for Cs+ ion, it is the ∆µex

LJ contribution

that is unfavorable as expected from the somewhat larger size of that ion relative to the nanopore

internal diameter.

Increasing the charge density on the nanopore increases the strength of cation-nanopore inter-

actions, making the pore interior increasingly favorable for all three cations. At a sufﬁciently high

value of nanopore charge (e.g., qpore = −5e), the ion-nanopore electrostatic interactions are large

and negative for all ions indicating that it is thermodynamically favorable for all three types of

ions to partition into the pore. The free energy varies approximately linearly with the nanopore

charge, and the threshold value of charge at which the transfer free energy changes from positive
to negative can be estimated from Figure 4. That threshold charge value is near −2e for K + and
Cs+ ions, and somewhat larger (∼ −3e) for the Na+ ion. That is for nanopore charge of slightly
larger than −2e, partitioning of K + and Cs+ ions will be quite favorable, whereas that of Na+

ion unfavorable, providing a signiﬁcant thermodynamic selectivity for partitioning of those larger
ions over the smaller Na+ ion. At high nanopore charge densities, although partitioning of all ions
into the nanopore is favorable, the K + ions appears to beneﬁt from its optimal size (compared to

the nanopore diameter) and corresponding hydration free energy in water. The balance of LJ and
electrostatic interactions for K + ion in bulk water and in the nanopore interior are such that its

partitioning is most favored at higher nanopore charge densities.

Based on the large thermodynamic driving force at charge densities greater than qpore = −3e,

we would expect partitioning of all three ions into the charged nanopores. Corresponding average

9

partitioning times are listed in Table I. It is clear that the timescale for partitioning of Na+ ions
for qpore = −4e is signiﬁcantly larger than that for K + and Cs+ ions, which partition over sub-

nanosecond timescales. The expected partitioning of Na+ in pores with total charge of −3e would

take even longer time, well beyond the scope of present simulations. Thus, the thermodynamic

and kinetic data suggest the existence of a free energy barrier for the ion partitioning process, the

height of which is different for different ions. Below we discuss possible physical origins of that

barrier.

Possible origins of the free energy barrier based on the dehydration of ions: The diameter of

the nanopore is small, just sufﬁcient to accommodate the cations. As seen in Figure 3, only two

water molecules are available for direct hydration of ions partitioned into the pore. In contrast, the

number of water molecules in the hydration shell of cations in bulk water is larger, approximately
5.3, 7, and 8, for Na+, K +, and Cs+ ions, respectively, consistent with previous simulation and

experimental studies [31, 32, 33, 34]. Ions thus undergo signiﬁcant dehydration as they partition

into the nanopore. As the ion approaches the end of the nanopore from outside, the ion-nanopore

interactions partially compensate for the loss of ion-water interactions. One would require nu-

merous simulations of the partitioning process or apply a combination of methods such as the

transition path sampling [35] and umbrella sampling [36, 37] to obtain detailed structural insights

into the transition state, the appropriate reaction path, and the free energy along that path. We have

not performed that analysis here. However, monitoring ﬂuctuations of the number of hydration

shell water molecules for cations in bulk water provides qualitative insights into the origin of the

free energy barrier.

Figure 5 shows the potential of mean force, -ln[p(Nhyd)], obtained from probability, p(Nhyd),

of observing Nhyd, number of water molecules in the hydration shell of three different cations.
Nhyd ﬂuctuates between 4 and 7 for Na+ ion, with an average value of 5.3. The hydration shells
of K + and Cs+ display higher ﬂuctuations, with Nhyd ranging between 4 to 10 for K + and 4
to 12 for Cs+, respectively. The trends in these ﬂuctuations are consistent with ion-water radial
distribution functions shown in Figure 5, which show tighter binding of water molecules to Na+
compared to that for the larger K + or Cs+ ions. The hydration number of 2 as required in the

nanopore interior is never observed spontaneously in simulations in bulk water, as the free energy

of such dehydration is rather high. However, the estimated value of free energy for Nhyd = 2 in
bulk water, approximately equal to 10kT for Cs+, 11kT for K +, and over 25kT for Na+ ion
is consistent with the signiﬁcantly slower partitioning of Na+ compared to K + and Cs+ ions.

10

Despite this consistency, it is important to note that the dehydration free energies do not equal the

free energy barrier for partitioning of these ions. The favorable ion-nanopore interactions assist

the dehydration of cations, therefore reducing the barrier height. This is supported by the fact

that the kinetic selectivity decreases with the increasing of the nanopore charge density. It will be

interesting to investigate the exact nature of the barrier and especially the role of water structure at

the pore opening in future simulation studies.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Nanoporous materials with well deﬁned pore sizes can provide excellent means to extract or

separate small solutes based on steric or shape effect alone [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. However, solvent

can play an important role through differential solvation of solutes in the bulk and in the pore

interior thereby providing selective partitioning of speciﬁc solutes of interest from a mixture of
similarly-sized solutes. We studied the partitioning of cations Na+, K + and Cs+ ions from bulk

water into negatively charged model cylindrical pores with increasing pore charge density using

MD simulations. Neutral and near neutral nanopores exclude ions from their interior. However,

over a certain range of negative charge density on the pore, the nanopores display selectivity toward
partitioning of the larger cations K + and Cs+ over that for the smaller Na+ ion. Nonequilibrium
kinetic simulations show that the partitioning is signiﬁcantly slower for Na+ compared to that
for K + and Cs+ ions, especially for lower charge densities on the pore. Thermodynamic and

kinetic observations collectively suggest the presence of a barrier for partitioning of cations into

the nanopore interior. Such a barrier is expected to slow down the ﬂow rates of ions through

nanopores. We found that trends in free energy of dehydration of ions in bulk water are consistent

with the partitioning kinetics.

Although our studies here are focused on a CNT-like model pore, the results are relevant to stud-

ies of carbon nanotubes focused on solute partitioning and transport [1, 2, 19, 22, 43, 44, 45, 46]

and to complementary theoretical analyzes [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. Previous studies of neutral

hydrated carbon nanotubes show that water ﬂows through their greasy interior in a frictionless

manner and the ﬂow rate is limited by the entry and exit barriers [19]. The low density region

at the center of charged nanopores observed here would present an internal barrier for water

transport. It will be interesting to explore to what extent such internal barriers will affect the ﬂow

rates of water through nanopores. More broadly, manipulating the balance of various interactions

11

through design of nanosystems and functionalization [54, 55, 56] provides a mechanism for

selective partitioning, separation, or transport of solutes of interest from a mixture of molecules

of similar size and shape. Lastly, the partitioning of cations into negatively charged pores of

subnanometer dimensions is qualitatively consistent with the picture emerging from experimental

studies of carbon supercapacitors [10]. Simulation studies of more realistic systems along these

lines may aid better design of high energy storage devices.

FIG. 1: Kinetics of ion partitioning from nonequilirbium MD simulations. Number of cations partitioned

into the negatively charged nanopore in water as a function of time in selected simulation runs. Nanopore

carries a charge of −ne, n = 2, . . . 8 from bottom to top. τi is the incremental time for the i-th cation to

partition into the pore. Data for N a+ (left), K + (middle), and Cs+ (right column) are shown.

FIG. 2: Water structure in neutral and charged nanopores.

(a) Snapshots of water molecules, (b) local

densities, and (c) orientations of water molecules in the interior of neutral and charged nanopores carrying

a total charge of −2e and −5e, respectively. θ is the angle between dipole vector and the Z axis as shown

schematically in panel (c).

FIG. 3: Average orientational preferences of water molecules in the nanopore interior in the presence of a

neutral LJ solute (K 0) or a cation (K +) for different charge states of the nanopore. Panels (b), (c), and (d)

show snapshots from simulations.

FIG. 4: Free energy, ∆µex

hyd, of water-to-hydrated-nanopore transfer of cations. LJ and electrostatic con-

tributions to the free energy are also listed. The threshold charge density at which the transfer free energy

becomes favorable is indicated by arrows.

FIG. 5: Cation-water oxygen radial distribution functions obtained from MD simulations of cations in bulk

water. The height of the ﬁrst peak decreases signiﬁcantly, indicating weaker binding of water to the ion

with increasing cation size. Inset: Potential of mean force, or the free energy of spontaneous ﬂuctuations

of hydration shell waters in kT units, F (Nhyd)/kT = −ln[p(Nhyd)], where p(Nhyd) is the probability

distribution of number of hydration shell water molecules.

Gibbs Hypothesis
and Symmetry Postulate

Abstract: The question of the origin of the Gibbs-factorials is recon-
sidered. It is argued, using the example of the Brownian-motion, that their
appearance in classical statistical calculations cannot in general be traced
back to the symmetry postulate of quantum mechanics as often assumed.

In this note I propose to consider a problem of interpretation with no im-
mediate practical consequence. It seems, nevertheless, worth of clariﬁcation.
In classical mechanics of pointlike particles dynamical states are associ-
ated with points of the phase-space. Though in general diﬀerent points in
phase-space correspond to diﬀerent dynamical states of the system, Gibbs
proposed 1 to make an important exception to this rule: phase points which
diﬀer only by permutations of identical particles are to be taken to represent
the same dynamical state and, therefore, must be counted only once in prob-
ability distributions over phase-space. At the same time Gibbs suggests that
since integrals over these distributions are much easier to handle without the
above restriction, an equivalent but simpler procedure would consist in di-
viding the unconstrained integrals by the number of equivalent phase-space
points. This last quantity is easy to compute: it is given by a simple product
each term of which is equal to the factorial of the number of particles of a
given type. The factorials in this product are the Gibbs-factorials and the
whole procedure will be called below Gibbs hypothesis.

The necessity of this strange statistics was recognized by Gibbs in connec-
tion with the mixing of gases and liquids. It follows from thermodynamics
that mixing of diﬀerent substances is accompanied by an entropy increase
related to the work extractable from the mixing process. However, the sta-
tistical description of the process reproduces this increase of the entropy

only if Gibbs-factorials are properly taken into account; otherwise the theory
would make no distinction between mixing of diﬀerent or identical gases and
would give no entropy change in either case. This argument of Gibbs may
also be expressed in a somewhat more general form by saying that methods
of statistical thermodynamics lead to an additive (extensive) entropy only if
Gibbs-factorials are introduced 2.

Though the necessity of using Gibbs-factorials in calculations had been
quickly accepted, sharp controversy as to the deeper sense of this procedure
arose in the ﬁrst quarter of the century3. However, with the birth of modern
quantum mechanics this debate came to a sudden end, since the symmetry
postulate of quantum theory seemed to settle the problem once for all. This
fundamental principle requires that under permutation of identical particles
the state vector changes at most by a phase factor which leads to no change
at all in the physical state of the system. Therefore, whenever symmetry
postulate is applicable it provides ﬁrm and transparent basis for Gibbs’ pro-
cedure indeed. This conclusion is corroborated by the theories of ideal Bose
and Fermi gases which in high temperature limit go over to the classical
statistical description of ideal gases with the Gibbs-factorial automatically
included 4.

According to the general opinion, the symmetry postulate of quantum me-
chanics fully elucidates the origin of Gibbs hypothesis and, therefore, serves
as the general explanation of it. In order to illustrate this point of view I
quote two examples. The ﬁrst one is from the Part 6.6 of 5: ”It is not pos-
(E) by N! to obtain
sible to understand classically why we must divide
the correct counting of states. The reason is inherently quantum mechani-
cal...” The second is from the Chapter 16 of the standard text by T.L.Terrel
referred to above: ”The new factor 1/N! · · · has arisen from our considera-
tion of the symmetry of wave functions. In turn, the quantum mechanical
postulate on symmetry of wave functions has its origin in the experimental
indistinguishability of identical particles. Gibbs had the intuitive forsight,
before the advent of quantum mechanics, to insert this factor 1/N!.”

P

A closer reﬂection, however, reveals that derivability of the Gibbs-fac-
torials from the symmetry postulate is in itself insuﬃcient to provide an
explanation of Gibbs hypothesis in the general case.
It certainly ensures
that quantum mechanics of identical particles automatically obey this hy-
pothesis but tells nothing of systems, consisting of similar (i.e. practically
indistinguishable but not truly identical) particles as e.g. colloid particles

2

in a suspension. Systems, consisting of such constituents, fall outside the
scope of the symmetry postulate but, nevertheless, require Gibbs-factorials
for their correct description in the framework of statistical thermodynamics.
Gibbs-factorials enter into the working formulae of colloid physics some-
what implicitely. They are hidden within the relations taken over from the
theory of dilute molecular solution whose properties are closely related to
those of dilute suspensions. In order to expound the signiﬁcance of Gibbs-
factorials for colloids as systems, consisting of similar but certainly not iden-
tical particles, let us consider the widely known example of the equilibrium
of Brownian-particles in the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth which was the
object of J.Perrin’s famous experiments. The treatment of this phenomenon
in colloid physics 6 is based on the formula

in which a′, v′ and ρ′ are the activity, molar volume and weight-volume
density of the dissolved substance, ρ is the density of the solvent and h is the
height above some reference plane. For ideal solutions of constant density
this equation may be integrated to obtain the barometric formula for the
particle density C ′

which was used by Perrin to calculate the Avogadro’s number.

Where does formula (1) come from? It comes from the formula for the
chemical potential of the solute in a molecular solution applied to colloid par-
ticles in a suspension. Such a borrowing conforms with the basic hypothesis
of Einstein’s famous 1905 paper 7 to the eﬀect that Brownian-particles are
nothing but molecules of visible size.

The second term in (1) is the change in the gravitational potential energy
of the dissolved matter corrected for the hydrostatic lifting force. What
concerns the logarithmic term, in textbooks on physical chemistry 8 it is
related through equilibrium condition µ′(l) = µ′(g) to the logarithmic term
in the chemical potential of an ideal gas.

Though these considerations constitute a true explanation of (1), an al-
ternative approach9 reveals that the logarithmic term bears in fact its origin
from the Gibbs-factorial n′! of the solute particles. The starting point of this

3

latter approach is the general expression of the free enthalpy G of a dilute so-
lution (in the limit n′ −→ 0) which obeys all the basic physical requirements
known to be satisﬁed by free enthalpy.

If at n′ = 0 G were a smooth function of n′ it could be expanded in powers

of n′ and to lowest nontrivial order the simple expression

G = G∗ + n′ · α

(3)

would be obtained in which G∗ is the free enthalpy of the pure solvent and α
is independent of n′. But G is in fact a singular function of n′ at n′ = 0 and
cannot be expanded in a Taylor-series around this point. The origin of the
singularity is the Gibbs-factorial n′! in the denominator of the statistical sum
Z. Since G = −kT ln Z the free enthalpy does contain a term +kT · ln n′!
which can be written also in the form kT · n′(ln n′ − 1). It is this term which
cannot be expanded around n′ = 0 and so must be explicitely included into
(3). Hence, we have at n′ −→ 0 the expression

G = G∗ + n′ · α + kT · n′(ln n′ − 1).

(4)

However, this formula is still in ﬂaw. G must be a ﬁrst order homogeneous
function of n and n′, the number of molecules in the solvent and the solute
respectively. Since the term ln n′ spoils homogeneity, G necessarily contains
another logarithmic term too wich combine with ln n′ into ln(n′/n). The
general lowest order form of the free enthalpy is, therefore,

G = G

(12)

which when solved leads again to the barometric formula (2).

In the second approach which has been now completed it is formula (12)
which corresponds to (1). Since in the limit n′ −→ 0 this last formula
becomes identical to (12) it is plainly obvious that the logarithmic terms
correspond to each other and both originate from the last term of (4) which
in turn stems from the Gibbs-factorial n′!. If, therefore, one admits that the
application of formulae of molecular physics to suspensions — the common
practice in colloid physics — is justiﬁed, then one thereby accepts also that
Gibbs-factorials must be applied to systems of both identical and similar
particles. Since the latters are outside the domain of the symmetry postulate,
quantum mechanics can not be claimed to provide the general basis for the
explanation of Gibbs hypothesis in spite of the common belief.

The notion of similar particles involves obviously an element of subjec-
tivity not shared by the concept of identity of particles. However, Gibbs-
factorials appear always as ingredients of the entropy (or related thermo-
dynamic functions), and the ambiguity in the distinction between similar
particles and distinguishable ones leads to the same kind of uncertainty in
it that has already been thoroughly discussed earlier in connection with the
anthropomorphic notion of the entropy 10.

This latter concept is based on the information theoretic interpretation
which identiﬁes entropy with the measure of the lack of information about the
system11. But information can be quantiﬁed only with respect to some set of a
priori expectations and it is these expectations through which an unavoidable
anthropomorphic element comes into play. A good example is provided by
the existence of isotopes 12. So far as the diﬀerences in their properties are
beyond the capacity of experiments (as is the case in classical chemistry)
no inconsistency is introduced by calculating the entropy of elements as if
isotopes were indistinguishable, though from the point of view of the theory
of isotope separation this would be a crude error.

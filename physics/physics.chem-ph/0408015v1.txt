We numerically implement the reactive ﬂux formalism on the basis of a recently proposed c-
number Langevin equation [Barik et al, J. Chem. Phys. 119, 680 (2003); Banerjee et al, Phys.
Rev. E 65, 021109 (2002)] to calculate transmission coeﬃcient. The Kramers’ turnover, the T 2
enhancement of the rate at low temperatures and other related features of temporal behaviour of
the transmission coeﬃcient over a range of temperature down to absolute zero, noise correlation
and friction are examined for a double well potential and compared with other known results. This
simple method is based on canonical quantization and Wigner quasiclassical phase space function
and takes care of quantum eﬀects due to the system order by order.

INTRODUCTION

The classic work of Kramers1 on the diﬀusion model of classical reaction laid the foundation of the modern dynamical
theory of activated processes. Since then the ﬁeld of chemical dynamics has grown in various directions to extend the
Kramers’ result to non-Markovian friction2,3, to generalize to higher dimensions4,5 and to semiclassical and quantum
rate theories6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 to apply extensively to biological processes20 and to several related issues.
An important endeavor in this direction is the formulation of reactive ﬂux theory9,19,21,26 which has been worked
out in detail over the last two decades by several groups. The method is essentially based on the realization of rate
constant of a chemical reaction as a Green-Kubo correlation function calculated at the transition state which acts
as a dividing surface between the reactant and the product states. In the spirit of classical theory of Kohen and
Tannor25 we have recently formulated a quantum phase space function approach to reactive ﬂux theory to derive a
transmission coeﬃcient in the intermediate to strong damping regime19. The object of the present paper is threefold:
(i) to extend the treatment to numerical simulation for calculation of time-dependent transmission coeﬃcient (ii) to
analyze the Kramers’ turnover, the T 2 enhancement of the rate at low temperature and some related features of
temporal behaviour of the time-dependent transmission coeﬃcient over a wide range of friction, noise correlation and
temperature down to vacuum limit and (iii) to conﬁrm the validity of our analytical result19 in the spatial diﬀusion
limited regime.

The present scheme of simulation is based on our recently proposed c-number Langevin equation15,16,17,18,19 coupled
to a set of quantum dispersion equations which take care of quantum corrections order by order. In what follows
we make use of these equations to follow the evolution of an ensemble of c-number trajectories starting at the top
of the barrier and sampling only the activated events and recrossing according to classical numerical reactive ﬂux
formulation of Straub and Berne27,28,29.

The outlay of the paper is as follows: we ﬁrst give an outline of c-number Langevin equation in Sec.II followed by
a discussion on the method of numerical simulation for calculation of transmission coeﬃcient using c-number reactive
ﬂux formalism in Sec.III. The numerical results are compared with those of others and discussed in Sec.IV. The paper
is concluded in Sec.V.

II. A BRIEF OUTLINE OF C-NUMBER LANGEVIN EQUATION AND THE COUPLED QUANTUM
DISPERSION EQUATIONS.

To start with we consider a particle coupled to a medium consisting of a set of harmonic oscillators with frequency

Here the masses of the particle and the reservoir oscillators have been taken to be unity. ˆq and ˆp are the coordinate
and momentum operators of the particle, respectively and the set
is the set of co-ordinate and momentum
operators for the reservoir oscillators linearly coupled to the system through coupling constant κj. V (ˆq) denotes the
external potential ﬁeld which, in general, is nonlinear. The coordinate and momentum operators follow the usual
commutation relations [ˆq, ˆp] = i¯h and [ˆqi, ˆpj] = i¯hδij.

Eq.(2) is an exact operator Langevin equation for which the noise properties of ˆF (t) can be deﬁned using a suitable
canonical initial distribution of bath co-ordinates and momenta. In what follows we proceed from this equation to
derive a Langevin equation in c-numbers. The ﬁrst step towards this goal is to carry out the quantum mechanical
average of Eq.(2).

Eq.(12) which is based on the ansatz Eq.(8), is governed by a c-number noise f (t) due to the heat bath, characterized
by Eq.(10), Eq.(11) and a quantum correction term Q(t) characteristic of the nonlinearity of the potential. The
canonical thermal Wigner distribution - the ansatz Eq.(8) is always positive deﬁnite. It goes over to a pure state
distribution for the ground state of shifted harmonic oscillator in the vacuum limit, i.e.
, at T = 0 which is again
a well-behaved37 distribution. The quantum nature of the dynamics thus arises from two sources. The ﬁrst one is
due to the quantum heat bath. The second one is because of nonlinearity of the system potential as embedded in
Q(t) of Eq.(15). To make the description complete for practical calculation one has to have a recipe for calculation
of Q(t)15,16,17,18,19,30,31. For the present purpose we summarize it as follows:

While the above set of equations provide analytic solutions containing lowest order quantum corrections, the
successive improvement of Q(t) can be achieved by incorporating higher order contribution due to the potential V (q)
and the dissipation eﬀects on the quantum correction terms. In Appendix A we have derived the equations for quantum
corrections upto fourth order30 as employed in the present numerical scheme. Under very special circumstances, it has
been possible to include quantum eﬀects to all orders18,31. The appearance of Q(t) as a quantum correction term due
to nonlinearity of the system potential and dependence of friction on frequency make the c-number Langevin equation
(Eq.(12)) distinct from the earlier equations of Schmid and Eckern et al 39,40. The approach has been recently utilized
by us to derive the quantum analogues15,16,17,18 of classical Kramers, Smoluchowski and diﬀusion equations with
probability distribution functions of c-number variables. An important success of the scheme is that these equations
of motion for probability distribution functions do not contain derivatives of the distribution functions higher than
second for nonlinear potentials ensuring positive deﬁniteness of the distribution functions. This is in contrast to usual
situations38 where one encounters higher derivatives of Wigner, Glauber-Sudarshan distribution functions for nonlinear
potential and the positive deﬁniteness is never guaranteed. More recently the classical Kohen-Tannor formalism of
reactive ﬂux has been extended to quantum domain19. In what follows we present a numerical simulation of reactive
ﬂux using c-number Langevin dynamics.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATION

The numerical solution of Eq.(12), along with Eqs.(A1) to Eq.(A3) is performed according to the following main

steps.

We ﬁrst brieﬂy outline the method of generation of c-number noise. Eq.(11) is the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation
f (t)f (t′)
and is the key element for generation of c-number noise.
is is correlation function which is classical in form
h
but quantum mechanical in content. We now show that c-number noise f (t) is generated as a superposition of several
Ornstein-Ulhenbeck noise processes. It may be noted that in the continuum limit c(t

In determining the evolution of stochastic dynamics governed by Eq.(12) it is essential to know a priori the form of

ρ(ω)κ(ω). We assume a Lorentzian distribution of modes so that

(cid:18)
where Γ and τc are the dissipation in the Markovian limit and correlation time, respectively. Eq.(20) when used in
Eq.(4) in the continuum limit yields an exponential memory kernel γ(t) = (Γ/τc)e−t/τc. For a given set of parameters

Γ and τc along with temperature T , we ﬁrst numerically evaluate the integral (19) as a function of time. In the next
step we numerically ﬁt the correlation function with a superposition of several exponentials,

The set Di and τi the constant parameters are thus known. In Fig.1 we compare the correlation c(t) determined
from the relation (19) with the superposition (21) for three diﬀerent temperatures at kT = 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 for Γ = 1.0
and τc = 3.0. The numerical agreement between the two sets of curves based on Eq.(19) and Eq.(21) suggests that
one may generate a set of exponentially correlated color noise variables ηi according to

Having obtained the scheme for generation of c-number noise f (t) we now proceed to solve the stochastic diﬀerential

The integration of the above set of equations26,29 is carried out using the second order Heun’s algorithm. A very

small time step size, 0.001, has been used.

The above set of equations diﬀer from the corresponding classical equations in two ways. First, the noise correlation
of c-number heat bath variables f (t) are quantum mechanical in character which is reﬂected in Di and τi. Second,
the knowledge of Q(t) requires the quantum correction equations given in the Appendix A which provides quantum
dispersion about the quantum mechanical mean values q and p of the system. It is thus essential to take care of
these contributions. A simple way to achieve this is to solve the equations Eq.(A1) to Eq.(A3) in the Appendix A
by starting with N-particles (say, around 5000) all of them above the barrier top at q = 0, half with a

replaced by ω0 corresponding to the reactant harmonic well which is in equilibrium with the bath. We take the time
averaged contribution of the quantum corrections upto 1/Γ time for each trajectory to solve the Langevin equation
Eq.(26) for N-particles. The time dependent transmission coeﬃcient is calculated from these sets of simulated data
by calculating

κ(t) =

N+(t)
N+(0) −

N−(t)
N−(0)

where N+(t) and N−(t) are the particles that started with positive velocities and negative velocities, respectively

and at time t are in or over the right hand well (i.e. the particles for which the quantum mean value q(t) > 0).

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

−

We now consider the potential of the form V (q) = a q4

b q2, where a and b are the two parameters. The other
three input parameters for our calculations are temperature T , strength of noise correlation Γ and correlation time
τc. For the present purpose we ﬁx a = 0.001 and b = 0.5 for the entire calculation except those for Fig.3 and Fig.8.
In order to ensure the stability of the algorithm we have kept ∆t/τc << 1 where ∆t is the integration time step size.
Fig.2 exhibits the temporal variation of classical transmission coeﬃcient (dotted line) and transmission coeﬃcient
calculated by present method (solid line) for two typical diﬀerent parameter regimes (a) Γ = 3.0 and (b) Γ = 5.0 for
kT = 0.5, τc = 3.0 to illustrate the diﬀerential behaviour of the classical26 and quantum eﬀects. In the both cases one
observes signiﬁcant increase in transmission coeﬃcient due to quantum contribution over and above the magnitude of
classical transmission coeﬃcient. In order to extract out the contribution of quantum correction due to nonlinearity
of the system potential Q(t) we exhibit in Fig.3 the time dependent transmission coeﬃcient for the parameter set
a = 0.005, b = 0.5, kT = 0.025, Γ = 1.0 and τc = 1.0 with (dotted line) and without (solid line) second order quantum
corrections. It is observed that the quantum corrections due to nonlinearity aﬀects the stationary values more than
the transient ones.

In order to check the workability of the method we now compare in Fig.4 the temporal variation of numerical
(dotted line) and analytical19 (solid line) transmission coeﬃcient at kT = 1.0 for two diﬀerent parameter regimes
characteristic of adiabatic regime (a) Γ = 2.0, τc = 5.0 (b) Γ = 4.0, τc = 8.0 and caging regime (c) Γ = 90.0, τc = 10.0,
the two regimes being diﬀerentiated according to ωb, Γ and τc; adiabatic (ω2
Γ/τc < 0),
ωb refers to the barrier frequency). We observe that while in the adiabatic regime the agreement is excellent the
numerical transmission coeﬃcients tend to settle down around zero relatively earlier compared to analytical one in
the caging regime; the numerically calculated phase of oscillation, however, corresponds correctly to its analytical
counterpart. Keeping in view of the fact that the analytical results are based on a phase space function approach
which is independent of the method of numerical simulation, we believe that the agreement is quite satisfactory in
both adiabatic and caging regimes which ensures the validity of the numerical procedure as followed in the present
treatment.

In Fig.5 we show the typical simulation results over a range of dissipation parameters Γ from 0.01 to 8.0 for τc = 1.0
and kT = 1.0. For a low value of Γ, e.g., 0.01 simulation result remains at a high value for some period to drop rather
suddenly and to settle ﬁnally in an oscillatory way to a low asymptotic value. The behaviour is almost qualitatively
same as its classical counterpart as shown by Sancho, Romero and Lindenberg26. The long temporal oscillation of
transmission coeﬃcient calculated by the c-number method is typical for very low dissipation regime. As dissipation
increases to 0.5 the temporal variation of κ(t) becomes monotonic and κ(t) settles down much earlier at a much higher
asymptotic value. For Γ = 1.0 to 8.0 the transmission coeﬃcient decreases rather signiﬁcantly. The oscillations at
short times for Γ = 5.0 and 8.0 are due to usual transient recrossings.

The variation of asymptotic transmission coeﬃcient with dissipation parameter Γ in Fig.5 illustrates the well known
turnover phenomenon. In Figs.6-8 we analyze this aspect in greater detail. To this end we show in Fig.6 how the
asymptotic transmission coeﬃcient as a function of dissipation constant Γ calculated (classical) earlier by Lindenberg
et al 26 follows closely to that of ours at relatively high temperature kT = 3.0 for τc = 3.0. The agreement between the
two allows us to have a numerical check on the method and to ensure the validity of the result in the classical limit.
The turnover problem was investigated earlier by Melnikov et al 34 and Pollak et al 35 to obtain correct analytical
solution bridging the spatial diﬀusion and the energy diﬀusion regimes and that goes over to the limiting behaviour
at high and low dissipation. To explore the quantum eﬀects we study the turnover behaviour at various temperatures
down to absolute zero as shown in Fig.7 for τc = 3.0. As the temperature is lowered the maximum at which the
turnover occurs shifts to the left and the damping regime that corresponds to classical energy diﬀusion, i.e., in the
low damping regime becomes exponentially small as one approaches to absolute zero. It is fully consistent with the
earlier observation9 made on this issue.

7

To check the validity of the numerical results on quantum turnover in a more quantitative way we have further
compared in Fig.8 our results (solid lines) with full quantum results (dotted lines) of Topaler and Makri13 (Fig.
9a-b of Ref.12) for two diﬀerent scaled temperatures kT = 1.744(200K) and kT = 2.617(300K) for a double well
potential with a = 0.0024 and b = 0.5 in the Ohmic regime.
It is immediately apparent from Fig.8 that the
transmission coeﬃcients calculated by simulation of the c-number Langevin equation with fourth order quantum
corrections compared satisfactorily with the full quantum results based on path integral Monte Carlo method of
Topaler and Makri13.

In Fig.9 we plot the temporal behaviour of transmission coeﬃcient κ(t) for diﬀerent temperatures for Γ = 1.0
and τc = 1.0. It is observed that κ(t) quickly settles after a fast fall and the asymptotic values of the transmission
coeﬃcient converge to a temperature independent value as the temperature is increased from kT = 0.0 to kT = 5.0.
Fig.10 exhibits this variation of asymptotic value of transmission coeﬃcient (dotted line) explicitly as a function of
temperature and a comparison with analytical19 results (solid line) for Γ = 2.0 and τc = 5.0. The agreement is found
to be excellent. In order to analyze the temperature dependence of the transmission coeﬃcient at low temperature
and compare with earlier results36, the numerical result (solid line) is ﬁtted against a function of the form (dotted
line) A exp(B/T 2), in the inset of Fig.10, where A and B are ﬁtting constants. The well known T 2 enhancement of the

quantum rate is observed upto a low temperature beyond which the ﬁtting curve tends to diverge rapidly as kT
This divergence of the rate at very low temperature had been noted earlier in the analytical result of Grabert et at 36.
In the present calculation, however the transmission coeﬃcient reaches its maximum ﬁnite value within unity and its
validity is retained even in the vacuum limit. Thus in contrast to classical transmission coeﬃcient the temperature
dependence remains a hallmark of quantum signature of the transmission coeﬃcient. In Fig.11 we show the temporal
behaviour of the transmission coeﬃcient for several values of the noise correlation time τc for kT = 1.0 Γ = 1.0. The
asymptotic transmission coeﬃcient increases as expected from theoretical point of view.

V. CONCLUSION

The primary aim of this paper is to extend our recent treatment of c-number Langevin equation to calculate
numerically the time dependent transmission coeﬃcient within the framework of reactive ﬂux formalism. Since the
quantum dynamics is amenable to a theoretical description in terms of ordinary coupled equations which are classical
looking in form it is possible to employ the numerical simulation scheme of Straub and Berne in a quite straight forward
way for calculation of transmission coeﬃcient. There are two special advantages in the procedure. First, since we
are concerned with the dynamics of quantum mechanical mean values coupled to quantum correction equations, we
etc in any stage of calculations. This makes the calculation simpler.
need not calculate higher moments
Secondly, the treatment can be readily used to calculate the dynamics even in the vacuum limit, i.e., kT
0, where
it is expected that because of the oscillating nature of the real time propagator in path integral method Monte Carlo
schemes pose very serious problems from applicational point of view. We have extended the classical simulation
procedure to a quantum domain taking into consideration of the quantum eﬀects in two diﬀerent ways. The quantum
eﬀects enter through the correlation function of the c-number noise variables of the heat bath and furthermore, through
nonlinearity of the system potential which is entangled with quantum dispersion around the quantum mechanical mean
values of the system operators. We summarize the main results as follows:

(i) The present method is a direct extension of classical simulation method of Straub and Berne to quantum domain
for calculation of transmission coeﬃcient within a c-number version of reactive ﬂux formalism. Although the quantum
eﬀects due to heat bath can be taken into account in terms of noise correlation expressed in quantum ﬂuctuation-
dissipation relation, the quantum dispersion around the quantum mean values of the system operators are to be
calculated order by order. Notwithstanding the latter consideration the method is eﬃcient when compared to full
quantum mechanical calculation as demonstrated in the present simulation.

(ii) We have calculated the time dependent transmission coeﬃcient for a double well potential over a wide range of
friction and temperature and shown that our numerical simulation results on turnover phenomena, low temperature
enhancement of quantum rate and other features agree satisfactorily with those calculated analytically/otherwise using
phase space function and other approaches. The diﬀerential behaviour of the classical and transmission coeﬃcients
calculated by the classical and present c-number method has been analyzed in detail. The procedure is equipped to
deal with arbitrary noise correlation, strength of dissipation and temperature down to vacuum limit, i.e., kT

0.

(iii) The present approach is independent of path integral approaches and is based on canonical quantization and
Wigner quasiclassical phase space function and takes into account of the quantum eﬀects upto a signiﬁcant degree of
accuracy. This procedure simply depends on the solutions of coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations rather than the
multi-dimensional path integral Monte Carlo techniques and is therefore complementary to these approaches, much
simple to handle and corresponds more closely to classical procedure.

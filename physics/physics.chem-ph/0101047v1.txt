GRECP/RCC-SD calculation of HgH

1. Introduction

The HgH molecule was studied in the last few decades with the help of both experimental
(e.g., see [1, 2, 3, 4]) and theoretical (e.g., see [5, 6, 7]) methods. The main purpose of
the theoretical investigations was to study accuracy and reliability of developed methods
for calculations of molecules containing heavy elements and to explain and systematize
some available experimental data.

In papers [8, 9], the 20 electron generalized relativistic eﬀective core potential (20e-
GRECP) was generated for mercury and was tested in numerical two-component SCF
(Hartree-Fock or HF) calculations by comparison with all-electron Dirac-Fock (DF)
and other RECP calculations. The suitability of the GRECP for describing correlation
eﬀects was examined in atomic calculations [10]. Signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy
of reproducing the all-electron Dirac-Coulomb data for the GRECP as compared with
RECPs of other groups [6, 11] was demonstrated in these calculations. The same number
of electrons, 20, is explicitly treated in the considered RECP versions. Here we present
results of calculations of spectroscopic constants for the HgH molecule and its ions.

2. The GRECP method

The GRECP method was described in detail in papers [8, 9, 12]. In this method, the
radial oscillations of the valence and outer core spinors are smoothed in the inner core
region of an atom to reduce the number of primitive Gaussian basis functions required
for the appropriate description of these spinors in subsequent molecular calculations.
Moreover, the smoothing allows one to exclude the small components of the four-
component Dirac spinors from the GRECP calculations, while relativistic eﬀects are
taken into account with the help of j-dependent eﬀective potentials. The Unlj potentials
are derived by inversion of the nonrelativistic-type HF equations in the jj-coupling
scheme for the “pseudoatom” with the removed inner core electrons:

conventional RECPs, the potentials are constructed only for the nodeless pseudospinors,
because division by zero appears in equation (1) for pseudospinors with nodes. This
problem is overcome in the GRECP method by interpolating the potential in the vicinity
of the pseudospinor node [13]. This allows one to generate diﬀerent potentials, Uclj and
Uvlj, for outer core and valence pseudospinors, unlike the conventional RECP approach.

The two main features of the GRECP method are the generation of eﬀective
potential components for pseudospinors which may have nodes and adding non-local
terms with projectors on the outer core pseudospinors (the second line in equation (2))
to the standard semi-local terms (the ﬁrst line in equation (2)) of the eﬀective potential
operator. Description of some other distinctive features of the GRECP generation as
compared to previous RECP schemes [11, 14] is given in [15]. As it was pointed out
earlier [9, 12], form (2) of the GRECP operator is optimal for calculation of states in
which occupation numbers of the outer core shells diﬀer from that in the state used for
the GRECP generation by the value much less than 1.

3. The RCC method

The Fock-space relativistic coupled cluster (RCC) method has been described in previous
papers (see, e.g., [16]) and reviews [17], and only a brief summary is given here. Starting
from the nonrelativistic-type Hamiltonian, H, containing the AREP part of the GRECP
operator, UAREP , the one-electron HF orbitals are obtained in an SCF procedure.
Matrix elements of the ESOP part, UESOP , of the GRECP operator as well as other one-
and two-electron integrals are calculated in the basis set of the obtained spin-orbitals.
The spin-orbit interaction (described by the UESOP operator) and correlations are then
included by the two-component Fock-space coupled-cluster (CC) method, with the help
of the exponential universal wave operator Ω = exp(T). The CC expansion is currently
truncated at the Singles and Doubles (CC-SD) level. In the Fock-space method, one
starts from a reference state (closed-shell in our implementation), correlates it, then
adds (or removes) one electron, recorrelating the new N + 1 (or N − 1) electron system,
and so on, until all the states of interest are attained. The electrons can be added to (or
removed from) a number of valence spin-orbitals, resulting in a multireference approach
characterized by a model space P of some selected states. The cluster amplitudes are
determined at that stage of the calculation, where they ﬁrst have a nonzero eﬀect on
the model space states for the considered number of electrons, and they are unchanged
on the following stages, thus constituting the universal wave operator. The eﬀective
Hamiltonian

where P is the projector onto the model space P , is diagonalized to give simultaneously
the energies of all the states in the ΩP -space relative to the initial reference state, with
all states correlated at the CC-SD level.

In the ﬁrst series of the RCC-SD calculation (RCC-1), the ground state of the HgH+

ion is the reference state, and the Fock-space scheme is

Heﬀ = PHΩP,

HgH+ → HgH

with electrons added in the lowest unoccupied σ and π one-electron states in HgH+.

In the second series of the RCC-SD calculation (RCC-2), the ground state of the

HgH− ion is the reference state, and the Fock-space scheme is

HgH− → HgH → HgH+

with electrons removed from the highest occupied σ state in HgH−.

For the molecular GRECP/SCF calculations, we have employed the MOLGEP [18]
The RCC-SD program package was interfaced with
and MOLCAS [19] codes.
the MOLGEP/MOLCAS codes to make it possible two-component GRECP/RCC-
SD calculations in the intermediate coupling scheme. Nonrelativistic kinetic energy
operators and relativistic eﬀective j-dependent potentials are employed in the latter
calculations.

4. Basis set

The basis set for mercury was optimized in atomic RCC-SD calculations with the help
of the procedure proposed in [10]. The basis functions were generated in HF calculations
of numerical orbitals for some neutral atomic or positively charged ionic states. The
HFJ code [8] was employed for the HF calculations with the GRECP.

We start with HF calculation of the 6s2 state of Hg with the spin-dependent GRECP
operator, to obtain numerical 5s1/2, 5p1/2, 5p3/2, 5d3/2, 5d5/2, 6s1/2 pseudospinors. The
6p1/2 and 6p3/2 pseudospinors are then derived from numerical calculations for the LS
averages of the [6s1]6p1 conﬁguration. In the conﬁguration notation given above, the
5s, 5p, 5d shells are understood to be in the square brackets and are dropped for brevity;
shells in the square brackets are frozen after the initial 6s2 state calculation.

The ˜ϕ5s, ˜ϕ5p, ˜ϕ5d, ˜ϕ6s, ˜ϕ6p and ∆ ˜ϕ5p, ∆ ˜ϕ5d, ∆ ˜ϕ6p numerical radial orbitals are

derived as

˜ϕns(r) = ˜ϕns+(r)
˜ϕnl(r) = N[ ˜ϕnl+(r) + ˜ϕnl−(r)]
∆ ˜ϕnl(r) = N ′[ ˜ϕnl+(r) − ˜ϕnl−(r)]

for l = 0,

for l = 1, 2,

for l = 1, 2,

(8)

(9)

(10)

where N and N ′ are the normalization factors. The reference basis set is constructed
from the 5s, 5p, 5d, 6s, 6p orbitals. An RCC-SD calculation with the spin-dependent
GRECP operator is carried out in this basis with the 18 external electrons of Hg
correlated. The Hg+ and Hg2+ have, obviously, one or two correlated electrons less.
The Fock-space scheme for this calculation is
Hg2+ → Hg+ → Hg

(11)

and electrons are added in the 6s, 6p one-electron states.

The next stage involves a series of the HF calculations of the 7p orbitals with the
AREP part of the GRECP operator for conﬁgurations corresponding to the neutral
Hg and Hgn+ ions, namely [5d106s1]7p1, [5d10−(n−1)]7p1 (n = 1, 2, . . . 10), [5p6−(n−11)]7p1
(n = 11, 12, . . . 16), etc. The frozen 5p and 5d orbitals in these calculations are taken
in the form of equation (9). The 7p orbitals localized in diﬀerent space regions are
derived from these calculations. A series of Schmidt-orthogonalized basis sets is formed
by addition of each of these 7p orbitals to the reference basis. Moreover, the basis
sets obtained by the addition of the ∆ ˜ϕ5p and ∆ ˜ϕ6p orbitals are also included in this
series. For each of the basis sets, an RCC calculation of nine low-lying states (the
ground 6s2 1S0 and excited 6s16p1 3P0,1,2 and 1P1 states of the neutral atom, 6s1 2S1/2
and 6p1 2P1/2,3/2 of Hg+, and 1S0 of Hg2+) with the spin-dependent GRECP operator
is performed. Similar series of calculations are carried out for the 7s orbitals instead
of the 7p, and also for the 6d, 5f, 5g orbitals. The principal quantum number of these
virtual orbitals is taken one higher than the maximum principal quantum number of
the corresponding orbitals in the reference basis set in order to avoid large overlap of
new and existing orbitals. For each basis set, the largest change among all possible
transition energies with excitation or ionization of a single electron between the nine

GRECP/RCC-SD calculation of HgH

states listed above is calculated relative to the results of the reference basis set. This
change is then multiplied by the 1/(2l + 1) factor where l is the orbital quantum number
of the added orbital. An orbital giving the largest change in comparison with the other
orbitals in the series is then added to the reference basis set. This way of generating
the basis is designed to describe primarily correlation and spin-orbit eﬀects which are
diﬀerent for the states under consideration. The procedure is repeated for the next
series of virtual orbitals, resulting in a step by step expansion of the reference basis and
diminution of changes in the transition energies. The procedure is terminated when the
transition energy change after adding the orbital goes down to about 15 cm−1. Then the
numerical radial orbitals are approximated by the Gaussian functions, thus producing
the (14, 12, 9, 3, 2)/[7, 7, 4, 2, 1] basis set.

For hydrogen, we employ the (8, 4, 3)/[4, 2, 1] basis set from the ANO-L library [19].

5. Results and discussion

As demonstrated in paper [10], the energetic contributions from correlations with the 5s
and 4f shells of Hg mainly cancel each other. Therefore, these electrons can be treated
as frozen in correlation calculations with accuracy about 200 cm−1 for transition energies
with excitation or ionization of a single electron. The molecular RCC-SD calculations
in the present paper are carried out for the 19 correlated electrons of the HgH molecule.
The molecular orbital originating from the 5s orbital of Hg is frozen after the HF
calculation of the HgH+ ion. The 4f, 4d, 4p, 4s and more inner core electrons of Hg are
excluded from the explicit consideration with the help of the 20e-GRECP.

The computational eﬀorts in the present RCC-SD calculations increase rapidly
with the size of the basis set and, therefore, the largest orbital angular momentum in

above mentioned transition energies, whereas the inherent 20e-GRECP errors are up to
100 cm−1 [10]. The errors caused by the use of the intermediate coupling scheme instead
of the jj-coupling scheme are up to 100 cm−1 as one can see from table 1. The total
errors of the 20e-GRECP/RCC calculation for the 18 correlated electrons of the Hg
atom with the (14, 12, 9, 3, 2)/[7, 7, 4, 2, 1] basis set in the intermediate coupling scheme
with respect to the experimental data are up to 1300 cm−1. The employed Fock-space
scheme for the atomic RCC-SD calculations in table 1 is

Hg2+ ← Hg+ ← Hg → Hg−

(12)

with the electrons added in the 6p, 7s, 7p one-electron states and removed from the 6s
state.

The molecular GRECP/RCC-SD calculations are carried out for 13 internuclear
distances from 2.637 a.u. to 3.837 a.u. with an interval of 0.1 a.u. The calculation of
the molecular spectroscopic constants begins with the ﬁtting of the GRECP/RCC-
SD potential curves by polynomials which are employed to construct appropriate

Schr¨odinger equations in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation solved by the Dunham
method with the help of the DUNHAM-SPECTR code of Mitin [20].

As one can see from tables 2 and 3 for the HgH and HgH+ ground states, the
noticeable diﬀerences between experimental data and calculated values as well as
between the results of two Fock-space schemes of the RCC-SD calculation are observed.
Taking into account our previous experience with the atomic Hg RCC calculations [10],
we suppose that the neglect of the triple cluster amplitudes is responsible for these errors.
We estimate the contribution from the these amplitudes by addition of diﬀerences in the
total energies from the corresponding nonrelativistic CC-SDT and CC-SD calculations
for the case of 3 correlated electrons of the HgH molecule. Our corrected results are in
better agreement with the experimental data.

The results for the excited 2Π1/2 and 2Π3/2 states of the HgH molecule having
the leading σ2π1 conﬁguration are presented in table 2. An comment similar to that
presented in the preceding paragraph can be given here.

Surprisingly good agreement of the spectroscopic constants for the ground states
of the HgH molecule and the HgH+ ion with experimental data was obtained in
calculations [6] employing the 20 electron energy-adjusted PseudoPotential (20e-PP) and
the ACPF method (see tables 2 and 3). It may be explained by fortuitous cancellation
of several contributions: the inherent PP errors (see [9, 10]), the errors of the method
employed for the correlation structure calculations, the basis set incompleteness, etc.
The agreement with the experimental data is substantially worse for the other employed
methods for the correlation structure calculations (see the corresponding results in [6]).
One should also remember that these results were obtained with help of the 20e-PP
which was generated by H¨aussermann et al. [6] using the results of the quasirelativistic
Wood-Boring [21] SCF all-electron calculations as the reference data for ﬁtting the spin-
orbit-averaged PP parameters and using the small number of adjustable parameters [22].
As one can see from table 4, large Basis Set Superposition Errors (BSSEs) (up
to 1800 cm−1 for dissociation energies) are observed (see [23] for details of the BSSE
calculation). They are mainly due to both a consideration of correlations in the core
region of Hg and the features of the employed basis set generation procedure (that is
described in section 4). This procedure optimizes the basis functions to describe ﬁrst
the transition energies but does not well optimize the basis set to describe “equal energy
lowerings” in the total energies which are mainly due to the core-core correlations having
similar properties for all the considered states. Since the transitions with the change
of the occupation numbers only for the valence shells are considered in the basis set
generation procedure, the generated basis set is close to a complete one in the valence
region but is unsaturated in the core region. Therefore, the BSSE only slightly depends
on a conﬁguration state in the valence region that allows one to exclude very accurately
the BSSE eﬀect with the help of the CounterPoise Correction (CPC). One can see from
table 4 that the results corrected for the BSSE are insensitive to the state employed
for the CPC calculation because these states have diﬀerent conﬁgurations only in the
valence region. The CPC calculated for the ground state of the H atom is about 1 cm−1

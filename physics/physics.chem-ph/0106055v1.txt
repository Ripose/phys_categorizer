Abstract
In this work we put forward a theoretical explanation of a peculiar eﬀect found very
recently by A. Gonz´alez Ure˜na et al. [3]. They have observed the deﬂection of a beam
of molecules posessing a permanet electric dipole moment by a homogeneous electric
ﬁeld when a resonant oscillating ﬁeld is superposed transverse to the static one.

INTRODUCTION

The molecular beam technique has signiﬁcantly contributed to the development
of the Atomic and Molecular Physics. Well known examples of this intellec-
tual and scientiﬁc development are the molecular beam magnetic or electric
resonance spectroscopy. There are excellent reviews [1, 2] on the subject em-
phasizing either spectroscopic or scattering applications. The basic principle
exploited in these techniques is the magnetic or electric focussing and/or deple-
tion due to the interaction between the permanent magnetic or electric moment
of a molecule and a non-homogeneous magnetic or electric ﬁeld, respectively.

The aim of the present work is to put forward an explanation to the eﬀect

reported in ref. [3]

In that experiment a N2O supersonic beam that interacts with both a DC
Stark ﬁeld and a resonant radiofrequency radiation. During the ﬂight of the
molecular beam pulse from the source to the detector, the molecules pass
through a homogeneous static electric ﬁeld. Changes in the beam intensity
were observed when a resonant oscillating electric ﬁeld is superposed transverse
to the static ﬁeld. Thus, a new phenomenon was observed which consists of N2O
beam depletion upon its interaction with both a homogeneous electric ﬁeld and
a resonant radiofrequency, see ref. [3] for details.

THEORETICAL DISCUSSION

When a neutral particle with an electric dipolar moment, µ, goes through an
electric ﬁeld, E, upon the particle is acting a force

F = ∇(µ · E)

(1)

Hence, if the electric ﬁeld is homogeneous the corresponding force vanishes

and the particle’s trajectory will not be aﬀected by the electric ﬁeld.

For understanding the experimental results[3] two types of interaction are
of relevance. Namely, the interaction of the permanent dipole moment with the
homogeneous electric ﬁeld (Stark interaction) and the new interaction between

the particle and both the static and the resonant oscillating ﬁeld (depletion
interaction). Let us consider them brieﬂy:

(a) Stark interaction

The quantum levels of a molecule that enters a homogeneous electric ﬁeld
are split by the Stark eﬀect. Then, a direction ‘that of the ﬁeld’ is singled out.
The rotational energy levels of a molecule (rigid rotor) are perturbed and

given by[4]:

WJM = hB

J(J + 1) +

(cid:16)

J(J + 1) − 3M 2
2J(J + 1)(2J − 1)(2J + 3)

E2

(cid:21)

(2)

Where J is the rotational quantum number, E is the electric ﬁeld, M is the
component of the angular momentum along the quantization axis, < µ > the
permanent electric dipole moment of the molecule, and B its rotational constant.
This equation is obtained by the second-order perturbation theory[4]. (The odd
terms in the series are identically zero and the fourth term is neglected because
it is quite small at the conditions of the present experiment[5]). As mentioned
earlier the transition considered in the experiment is the (1,±1) → (1,0). For
this transition equation (2) yields an energy splitting, ∆W :

∆W = W (1, 0) − W (1, ±1) =

hBλ2, with λ =

hB

The oscillator frequency ω for the transition is obtained applying the usual

Bohr relation

(4)
For example, for the N2O molecule, with < µ > = 0.161 D and I=6.68 10−46
Kg m2 [6-8], the frequency of the transition (1,±1) → (1,0)is equal to 286.9 kHz
when the static ﬁeld has an intensity of 191.3 kVm−1.

ω = ∆W/η

(b) Depletion interaction

In a previous study on the dynamics of a moving system, which also has
an internal angular momentum[9], the main conclusion of that work was that
the trajectory of a moving particle, possessing internal angular momentum, can
be modiﬁed when a torque is applied with a perpendicular component to the
rotational angular momentum vector. Speciﬁcally the following behaviour was
predicted[5] for a ‘particle’ with angular momentum J and velocity v to which
a torque Γ is applied the system would behave as if a central force given by
equation (5) applied. See Appendix for the main points of the derivation and
ref. [9] for details.

F = mv × Ω

(5)

where Ω = Γ

<J> and where Ω direction, is that of external ﬁeld.

To test this force, an experiment for a microscopic system was suggested[9],
based on the interaction of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld and electromagnetic
radiation with a particle that has spin and magnetic moment.
It was then
predicted that the deviation from the original trajectory should take place when
the radiation is resonant with a quantum transition between the energy levels
of the particle. Notice that according to the current wisdom (i.e.
standard
mechanics and electromagnetic ) no deviation of the particle should occur as it
is moving in a homogenous magnetic ﬁeld.

The present work deals with an experiment carried out with a N2O super-
sonic beam that interacts with both a DC Stark ﬁeld and a resonant radiofre-
quency radiation. From a physical point of view the (present) electric resonant

beam experiment is equivalent to the one suggested in Ref [9]. Indeed, a Stark
ﬁeld replaces the Zeeman ﬁeld and the particle magnetic moment is replaced by
the permanent dipole moment of the linear N2O molecule, which for the present
investigation is considered as a rigid rotor. Again according to standard me-
chanics and electromagnetism the trajectory of a molecule in the beam should
be not aﬀected by the electric ﬁeld since this is homogeneous. So that, any even-
tual beam depletion would in principle indicate the presence of the new force
mentioned above (unless some other ‘conventional’ interpretation, of which we
are not aware, could be found).

As said above, we deal with the rotational quantum states J = 1 MJ = 0, ±
1. The Stark interaction ensures molecular polarization and therefore quantized
orientations of the J vector with respect to E while the molecule keeps rotating
at each of these polarized (MJ ) states.

We will deal with the motion of the molecular beam under the applied ﬁelds,
E, homogeneous and constant, and E1, which is an oscillating ﬁeld. To do it,
we are going to use a semiclassical approach wherein it is assumed that such
motion can be reasonably well described by studying how the mean values (for
the relevant quantum states) of the dipole moment operator evolve in presence
of the external ﬁelds and then applying Eq. (5) with the torque computed by
using those mean values of the dipole operator.

Now when no external ﬁeld is present the mean value of the dipole opera-
tor, ˆµ , is zero for any rotational state, that is < ψJM |ˆµ|ψJM >= 0 , simply
due to symmetry (parity) reasons. But if the molecule is interacting with a
homogeneous electric ﬁeld, E=(0,0,E), there is a interaction hamiltonian

ˆHint = −ˆµ · E = − < µ > E cos θ

(6)

where θ is the polar angle, and then J is no longer a ‘good’ quantum number
since [ ˆHint, ˆJ] 6= 0.

Restricting our discussion to the relevant, J=1, non perturbed states, and
in ﬁrst order perturbation theory, the corresponding quantum states with E
present are

|Ψ1M > = |ψ1M > +

< ψ00|Hint|ψ1M >
ε1 − ε0

|ψ00 > δM0

+

< ψ2M |Hint|ψ1M >
ε1 − ε2

|ψ2M > (M = 0, ±1)

(7)

Where |ψJM > are the ‘non perturbed’ (rotational) states and εJ = hBJ(J +
1) are the unperturbed (no ﬁeld) energies. (Note that, in spite of the notation,
|Ψ1M > is not an eigenstate of ˆJ 2; yet it is of ˆJZ , with eigenvalue M .)

Now the mean value of ˆµ in a state |Ψ1M > is no longer zero. In fact, one

has

but

< Ψ1M |ˆµX |Ψ1M >=< Ψ1M |ˆµY |Ψ1M >= 0

< Ψ1M |ˆµZ |Ψ1M >= −

W1M − ε1
E

6= 0

(8)

(9)

where W1M is the energy corresponding to the state |Ψ1M > (Eq. (2))

Therefore, we see that, in presence of the constant ﬁeld E, the mean value
of the dipole operator in any quantum state (that is, for all values of M=0,±1)
is a vector directed along the ﬁeld (Z) direction.

In this situation, the new eﬀect does not operate because the corresponding
torque (computed as stated before) is zero, and, consequently, no depletion of
the molecular beam takes place.

However, the presence of an oscillating electric ﬁeld, E1 = (E1 cos ωt, E1 sin ωt, 0),

perpendicular to E, as shown in Figure 1, where this situation is been displayed
just before the interaction takes place, gives rise to a torque, Γ1 =< µ > ×E1
(where < µ > is the mean value of < ˆµ > in the corresponding quantum state),
that makes the molecules dipole (its mean value, of course) to deviate from its
previous direction (parallel to E) due to the nutation performed by the molecules
angular momentum, the nutation velocity being (recall eq. (5))

Ω1 =

Γ1
< J >

Ω2 =

Γ2
< J >

where Ω1 direction, is that of E1.

Then, there is a torque induced by E, Γ2 =< µ > ×E (because E and < µ >
are no longer parallel ) and, besides the said nutation, the angular momentum,
< J >, starts precessing about E with a velocity

where Ω2 direction, is that of E.

If the frequency of the precession induced by the homogeneous electric ﬁeld is
resonant with the frequency of the oscillating ﬁeld, then the interaction keeps up
coherence, that is, the plane deﬁned by the homogeneous ﬁeld E and the dipole
moment < µ > (to be called α hereafter) precesses about E as depicted in Figure
2. In this Figure, the system evolution is shown after a time t, together with the
trajectory S followed by the molecule under resonant conditions. Notice how
the oscillating ﬁeld, E1 (which is emulated experimentally by an electromagnetic
radiation), remains perpendicular to α during the interaction time. Indeed, the
particle deﬂection from the original X direction is clearly noticed. On the other
hand, if there is no resonance, the α plane precession velocity, Ω2, and that of
the oscillating ﬁeld, ω, are diﬀerent, and then the interaction is not coherent
and the eﬀect (averaged in time) turns out to be null. (Notice that, from (10),
one has Ω1 = <µ>E1 cos(Ω2−ω)t

).

Then (see Appendix and for a complete classical treatment, ref.

[5]) there
will be two forces (of analogous type) acting at the CM of the molecule that
will modify its trajectory (recall eq. (5))

<J>

(10)

(11)

(12)

F1 = mv × Ω1

F2 = mv × Ω2

where v is the velocity of the centre of mass of the molecule. When the inter-
action begins, and because of the oscilating ﬁeld, molecules in resonance start
to follow a circular trajectory in plane α , of radius R1 = v

Simultaneously, F2, causes the precession of plane α, that contains the cir-
cular trajectory about E. This interaction can be visualized by regarding the
said molecules as describing a circle in α while this plane is precessing about
E with velocity Ω2. This eﬀect remains as long as such molecules are acted by
both ﬁelds, and, consequently, they will not reach the detector.

Ω1 .

To summarize: If the oscillating electric ﬁeld E1 is not resonating, that is
its frequency is not that corresponding to the transition between the MJ =
0 and MJ = ± 1 levels, then the new eﬀect is absent and, consequently, no
depletion of the molecular beam takes place . However, things are diﬀerent
when the oscillating ﬁeld has a frequency which corresponds to the transition
between the mentioned levels, for, in such a case, and as predicted in [9] an eﬀect
appears which deﬂects the trajectory of molecules in the J=1 state, as observed

in the present experiment. The depletion depends on both the intensity of the
homogeneous electric ﬁeld and the resonant ﬁeld. Nevertheless, the important
point is that the oscillation between the two levels is the necessary ingredient
for the new interaction totake place, not the transition between levels itself.

CONCLUSION

[3] can be understood by a semiclassical model,
The eﬀect reported in ref.
presented here, based upon the work presented in ref. [9], which concerns only
the classical domain. Up to our knowledge, there is no conventional explanation
for this eﬀect.

Figures

Figure 1: The frames X, Y, Z (laboratory), and X’Y’Z’ (attached to the
molecule) are shown. O is the origin of the laboratory system; O’, that of sys-
tem axis linked to the particle and also the location of the centre of mass of the
particle. The mean dipole moment < µ > and angular momentum < J > are
parallel to E (Z-axis). The situation is represented when, due to the interaction
with E1 the depletion of the molecule starts.

Figure 2: Detailed view of the particle’s trajectory from t = 0 until t = t
when the resonant conditions are fulﬁlled. The molecule moves from O along the
spherical surface with radius r centred at C. S, the particle’s trajectory results
from the combinations of (a) a circular path, Sα, with radius r and centred at C
along the Y’Z’ plane, called α hereafter, wich contains E, < µ >, < J > and v,
and (b) the rotation of α around the OC axis with (angular) velocity Ω2. The
XYZ frame has been displaced to O’ for a better illustration of the rotational
movements. The X’Y’Z’ plane is tangent to the sphere at O’; consequently the
Z’ axis is perpendicular to the surface of the sphere at O’ and contains C. As
indicated, the particle’s trajectory is always located on the sphere surface. Since
the position of O’ is deﬁned by θ and r, ˙θ deﬁnes the O’ angular velocity with
respect to the laboratory axis. In addition Ω1 is the X’Y’ (nutation) velocity
with respect to the laboratory axis. Notice how ˙θ and Ω1, always coincide as
described in equation (A11). See text and appendix for further details.

APPENDIX

In this Appendix we present a brief treatment of the classical motion of a rigid
body- with internal angular momentum – that is moving with respect to a given
(inertial) frame and is subjected to the action of a torque which is perpendicular
to the angular momentum vector. This situation is clearly related to the classical
motion of molecules as described in the text.

The corresponding equations of motion will be obtained by the Hamiltonian
formulation. It should be noted that the Hamiltonian formulation is developed
for holonomous systems and the forces derived from a potential that depends on
the position or from generalized potentials. A torque is applied to the present
system. The result of the forces is zero on the center of mass and, therefore, it
is meaningless to refer to potential energy.

The Hamiltonian describing the centre of mass motion of the ‘body’ is, there-
fore, that of a free particle but for the fact that the motion is constrained by
the presence of the torque. Such constrain is expressed by the equation

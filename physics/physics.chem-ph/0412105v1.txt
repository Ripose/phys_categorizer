Abstract

Quantum mechanical calculations are reported for the Li + HF(v = 0, 1, j = 0) → H + LiF(v′, j′)

bimolecular scattering process at low and ultralow temperatures. Calculations have been performed

for zero total angular momentum using a recent high accuracy potential energy surface for the X 2A′

electronic ground state. For Li + HF(v = 0, j = 0), the reaction is dominated by resonances due

to the decay of metastable states of the Li · · · F − H van der Waals complex. Assignment of these

resonances has been carried out by calculating the eigenenergies of the quasibound states. We also

ﬁnd that while chemical reactivity is greatly enhanced by vibrational excitation the resonances get

mostly washed out in the reaction of vibrationally excited HF with Li atoms. In addition, we ﬁnd

that at low energies, the reaction is signiﬁcantly suppressed due to the formation of rather deeply

bound van der Waals complexes and the less eﬃcient tunneling of the relatively heavy ﬂuorine

atom.

INTRODUCTION

The past few years have witnessed an extremely proliﬁc research eﬀort in the experimental

and theoretical investigation of ultracold molecules. The rapid development of techniques

for cooling, trapping, and manipulating molecules at ultracold temperatures [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] led

recently to the creation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of diatomic molecules [2, 3, 4].

This major achievement opens new perspectives in the exploration of the crossover regime

between BEC and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS) superﬂuidity [6, 7, 8, 9], as well as

in the conception of qubits in quantum computers using electric dipole moment couplings

between ultracold polar molecules [10, 11, 12, 13].

Among the wealth of techniques developed for producing ultracold molecules, photoas-

sociation of ultracold atoms [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] has proven its success in creating ultracold

(T ≃ 100 µK) polar neutral molecules. Indeed, using that technique, magneto-optical trap-

ping of ultracold polar neutral ground state KRb [19] and NaCs [20] molecules, as well as
formation of RbCs∗ molecules from a laser-cooled mixture of 85Rb and 133Cs atoms [21, 22]

were recently reported. Exothermic chemical reactions and vibrational relaxation triggered

by collisions are important factors limiting the lifetime of molecules created by photoasso-

ciation in highly excited vibrational levels [23, 24]. Although collisional studies of ultracold

molecules have been a matter of active research in recent years [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], rel-

atively few progress has been reported on chemical reactivity of polar molecules at ultralow

temperatures [32, 33].

In this work, we report quantum scattering calculations for the Li+HF → H+LiF reaction

at cold and ultracold translational energies. Since methods for cooling and trapping alkali

metal atoms have reached high degree of sophistication and creation of BEC of alkali metal

atoms has become rather widespread, collisions of ultracold alkali metal atoms with polar

molecules are being explored as a possible method for creating ultracold polar molecules.

Thus, cross sections for elastic and ro-vibrationally inelastic collisions of Li + HF system

are of signiﬁcant interest. Moreover, from a chemical dynamics point of view the Li + HF

collision is especially interesting due to the unusually deep van der Waals minimum of about
0.24 eV (1936 cm−1) in the entrance channel of the collision. Since Li + HF → LiF + H

involves the transfer of the relatively heavy F atom (the LiH + F channel is highly endoergic

and is not open at low energies), it will be particularly interesting to see whether the reaction

2

will occur with signiﬁcant rate coeﬃcient at ultralow energies.

The Li+HF reaction has been the topic of a large number of experimental and theoretical

studies. After the pioneering crossed beam work of Taylor and Datz [34], the Li + HF

reaction became a prototype system for experimental studies of the “harpoon” mechanism

in reactions between alkali or alkaline earth metal atoms and hydrogen halide molecules [35].

Thus, a large amount of experimental information has been reported for key observables such

as integral and diﬀerential reactive cross sections [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]. On the

theoretical front, numerous quantum mechanical [38, 39, 40, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52,

53] as well as classical trajectory [40, 54] scattering calculations have been performed on the

ground state potential energy surface (PES). The relative simplicity of the LiHF system, with

only 13 electrons, makes it very suitable for accurate ab initio calculations. Consequently, a
rich variety of analytic global ﬁts to the X 2A′ symmetry electronic ground state PES have

been proposed [52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70]. As

mentioned above, one of the unique aspects of the LiHF system is the rather deep van der

Waals well in both the Li + HF and H + LiF channels. Unlike the well studied F + H2 and
Cl + H2 systems where the van der Waals well depth is about 100 − 200 cm−1, the van der

Waals well in the Li + HF is an order of magnitude deeper, giving rise to long-lived collision

complexes and narrow scattering resonances in the energy dependent reaction probabilities.
The presence of the deep van der Waals well in the Li(2S) + HF(X 1Σ+) entrance valley was

conﬁrmed by backward glory scattering experiment of Loesch and Stienkemeier [37] and by

spectroscopic measurements of Hudson et al. [71].

The X 2A′ LiHF PESs used in previous scattering studies were based on a relatively

restricted sets of ab initio data, thus limiting the accuracy of the calculations. Furthermore,

the energy range investigated did not cover the translationally cold and ultracold regimes.
Here, we report quantum scattering calculations for Li(2S) + HF(X 1Σ+; v = 0, 1, j = 0) →
H + LiF(X 1Σ+; v′, j′) collisions, for a total molecular angular momentum J = 0, using the

recent high accuracy global PES of the LiHF ground state calculated by Aguado et al. [70].

A brief review of the basic characteristics of the PES is given in Sec. II, together with a

summary of the quantum scattering approach with illustrative convergence tests assessing

the validity of our calculations.

In Sec.

III, we present state-to-state and initial-state-

selected probabilities, cross sections, and rate coeﬃcients for both reactive and non-reactive

open channels of the collision. We discuss the eﬀect of vibrational excitation on chemical

3

reactivity at low temperatures and provide a summary of our ﬁndings in Sec. IV.

II. CALCULATIONS

A. X 2A′ state potential energy surface

Calculations reported in the present study have been carried out using the recent LiHF

ground state PES of Aguado et al. [70]. This chemically accurate PES was computed

for about 6000 nuclear geometries using internally contracted multireference conﬁguration

interaction (MRCI) wave functions including all single and double excitations and Davidson

size consistency correction (+Q). A large atomic basis set was used to adequately describe
the Li+ + HF− and Li+ + H−F ionic conﬁgurations responsible for the curve crossing leading

to the LiF products in the adiabatic representation of the electronic ground state. A saddle
point results from the crossing between the Li++HF− ionic state and a covalent conﬁguration
correlating to Li(2S)+HF(X 1Σ+). On the basis of these MRCI+Q results, an analytic global

PES was constructed using the modiﬁed many-body expansion of Aguado and Paniagua [72].

Major features of this PES are as follows: a −0.241 eV deep van der Waals well corresponding

to the Li· · · FH complex in the entrance channel due to strong dipole electric ﬁelds of the

reagents followed by a saddle point at +0.251 eV. The formation of the LiF· · · H complex

takes place in a late shallow van der Waals well with a minimum at +0.118 eV in the
product valley, connecting with the H(2S) + LiF(X 1Σ+) products asymptote at +0.186 eV.
All energies are relative to the Li(2S) + HF asymptote with energy E = 0 corresponding

to the bottom of the HF potential. Thus, the Li + HF → H + LiF reaction is endoergic

with exclusion of the zero-point energy of the reactants and products. The reaction becomes

exoergic with ground state reagents if the zero-point energy of the reactants and products is
included. The exoergicity is 0.01122 eV with ground state reagents. The LiH(X 1Σ+)+F(2P )

products lie at 3.57 eV and this reaction channel is closed for the energy range covered in

this study.

B. Quantum scattering calculations

Quantum reactive scattering calculations have been performed using the ABC program

developed by Skouteris, Castillo and Manolopoulos [73]. This implementation of the coupled-

4

channel hyperspherical coordinate method solves the Schr¨odinger equation in Delves hyper-

spherical coordinates for the motion of the three nuclei on the parametric representation of a

single Born-Oppenheimer PES with reactive scattering boundary conditions applied exactly.

Parity-adapted S−matrix elements, SJ,P

v′j′k′,vjk, are computed for all the arrangements of
the collision products for each given (J, P, p) triple, where J is the total angular momentum

quantum number and P and p are the triatomic and diatomic parity eigenvalues, respec-

tively; v and j are the usual diatomic vibrational and rotational quantum numbers and k

is the helicity quantum number for the reactants, their primed counterparts referring to the

products. After transformation of the parity-adapted S−matrix elements into their stan-

dard helicity representation, SJ

v′j′k′,vjk, initial state selected cross sections are calculated as

a function of the kinetic energy, Ekin, according to

σvj(Ekin) =

where kvj is the incident channel wave vector and the helicity quantum numbers k and k′
are restricted to the ranges 0 6 k 6 min(J, j) and 0 6 k′ 6 min(J, j′). Let us note that for

zero total molecular angular momentum and s−wave scattering in the incident channel, Eq.

(1) merely reduces to a summation over the quantum number v′ and j′.

C. Convergence tests

At very low temperatures, quantum tunneling becomes the dominant mechanism of chem-

ical reaction when energy barriers are present. As a consequence, the reaction probabilities

are usually very small and particular care must be paid to the convergence of scattering

calculations. We have performed extensive convergence tests of the initial-state-selected

and state-to-state reaction probabilities with respect to the maximum rotational quantum

number, jmax, and cut-oﬀ energy, Emax, that control the basis set size, the maximum value

of the hyperradius, ρmax, and the size of the log derivative propagation sectors, ∆ρ.

The energy dependence of the Li+HF(v = 0, j = 0) → H+LiF(v′, j′) reaction probability

is shown in Fig. 1 for diﬀerent values of ρmax and ∆ρ. Convergence with an accuracy better
than 10−10 was achieved over the range 10−5 − 10−3 eV using the values ρmax = 50.0 a.u.

and ∆ρ = 0.005 a.u. A more stringent convergence test consisted in the analysis of the

product rotational distribution represented in Fig. 2. The same values of ρmax and ∆ρ as

5

above were used to calculate the state-to-state reaction probabilities for Li + HF(v = 0, j =
0) → H + LiF(v′ = 0, j′) at a ﬁxed incident kinetic energy of 10−5 eV. Using the results

obtained with jmax = 25 and Emax = 3.2 eV as a reference, similar accuracy was found

using jmax = 20 and a cut-oﬀ internal energy Emax = 2.9 eV in any channel. The basis

set corresponding to these values was composed of 771 local basis functions. As Fig. 2

illustrates, the state-to-state reactive probability is particularly sensitive to the size of the

basis set at low translational energies. On the basis of these convergence tests, values of

ρmax = 50.0 a.u., ∆ρ = 0.005 a.u., jmax = 20 and Emax = 2.9 eV were adopted for the

calculations reported hereafter.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The initial state-selected reaction probability for LiF formation in Li + HF(v = 0, j = 0)

collisions is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the total energy. Our results are presented

along with the recent time-independent quantum coupled channel hyperspherical calcula-

tions of Lagan`a, Crocchianti, and Piermarini [51] obtained with a scaled PES of Parker et

al. [45]. Both sets of results are consistent with respect to the magnitude of the predicted

probability, i.e., both exhibit small values for the reaction probability. This merely reﬂects

the fact that for collisions with HF molecules initially in their ground vibrational state the

reaction proceeds mainly by quantum tunneling through the barrier. The unusually large

well depth of the van der Waals potential in the entrance valley eﬀectively raises the reac-

tion barrier, thus leading to small values of the reaction probability. Our results conﬁrm

that there is indeed a dense resonance structure at low energies associated with quasibound

states of the Li · · · F−H van der Waals complex [50, 51]. However, the positions of the peaks

predicted by our calculations are noticeably diﬀerent from the quantum scattering results of

Lagan`a et al. As discussed by Aguado et al. [53], the PES of Parker et al. used in most of the

LiFH dynamical calculations performed until 1997, is based on a limited set of ab initio data

and ad hoc modiﬁcations introduced to reproduce experimental properties resulted in arti-

ﬁcial features in the PES. In addition, the total energy threshold for the time-independent

calculations of Lagan`a et al. [51] is higher than our value of 0.2535 eV corresponding to the

energy of the HF(v = 0, j = 0) state. However, their time-dependent calculation carried

out using wavepacket methods is in line with our prediction of the threshold position [see

6

51, Fig. 3]. Comparison of our results presented in Fig. 3 with the recent quantum me-

chanical scattering calculations of Wei, Jasper, and Truhlar [50] is also very revealing of the

quantitative discrepancies introduced by the PES in dynamical studies at low temperatures.

Their time-independent quantum calculations using the variational method employed the

global ab initio PES of Jasper et al. [67]. Brieﬂy, this ground-state PES is characterized by
a reactant van der Waals well at −0.21 eV relative to the Li(2S) + HF asymptote, followed

by a saddle point at +0.35 eV, a product van der Waals well at +0.167 eV and ﬁnally a

product asymptote at +0.21 eV. This potential also exhibits a second saddle point in the

product valley at +0.224 eV. Compared to our results, the reaction probability obtained by

Wei et al. for LiF formation is smaller by more than an order of magnitude. This reﬂects

the eﬀect of a 0.1 eV higher barrier in the reactant channel as well as the presence of a

second saddle point in the product valley of the PES of Jasper et al.

Fig. 4 shows the state-to-state reaction probabilities for LiF(v′, j′) formation as a function

of the product rotational quantum number, j′, in Li + HF(v = 1, j = 0) collisions. For a
ﬁxed incident kinetic energy of 10−5 eV, 5 vibrational levels are energetically accessible in

the diatomic products of the reactions, each of these levels supporting 20 rotational states

as restricted by our cut-oﬀ value for jmax. The probability for LiF formation is larger for

intermediate-j′ product channels of the v′ = 0 and v′ = 1 vibrational levels. A broad

peak centered at j′ = 10 appears in the population distribution of these vibrational states,
corresponding to an exoergicity of 4.85 × 10−1 eV = 11.183 kcal/mol and 3.74 × 10−1 eV =

8.629 kcal/mol for the reaction to v′ = 0 and v′ = 1, respectively. Vibrational excitation

of the reactants signiﬁcantly increases the reaction probability, as can be seen from the

comparison of Fig. 2 and Fig. 4.

Initial-state-selected cross sections for LiF formation and for nonreactive scattering in

Li + HF(v = 0, 1, j = 0) collisions are displayed in Fig. 5 for incident translational ener-
gies covering the range 10−7 − 10−1 eV. The reaction cross section is rather small for HF

molecules initially in their ground vibrational state since quantum tunneling of the relatively
heavy ﬂuorine atom is the dominant reaction mechanism. For energies below 10−5 eV, the

reaction cross section reaches the Wigner regime [74] where it varies inversely as the velocity.
However, a strong peak centered at 5 × 10−4 eV is observed where the cross section increases

by about six orders of magnitude. This feature suggests that reactivity may be more im-

portant at low temperatures than generally recognized. For translational energies beyond

7

10−3 eV, the reaction cross section is characterized by resonant spikes due to metastable

states of the Li · · · F − H van der Waals complex in the initial channel. Nonreactive channels

of the Li + HF(v = 0, j = 0) collisions are open only for translational energies larger than
5.06 × 10−3 eV, thereby explaining the sharp rise in the nonreactive cross section at this

value corresponding to the energy for rotational excitation to the ﬁrst excited state of the

product, HF(v = 0, j = 1). Beyond this energy threshold, nonreactive scattering becomes

more favorable than LiF formation, as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 5. On the contrary,

in Li + HF(v = 1, j = 0) collisions the reactive channel dominates the nonreactive processes,

with a LiF/HF product branching ratio reaching 20 at low and ultralow temperatures. This

is especially interesting as the reaction involves quantum tunneling of the relatively heavy

ﬂuorine atom. Moreover, chemical reactivity is greatly enhanced by vibrational excitation.

In the Wigner regime, where cross section ratios become constant, the reaction cross section

involving excited HF(v = 1, j = 0) reactants are 635 times larger than for collisions with

HF reactants in their rovibrational ground state.

Further characterization of the peaks represented in the lower panel of Fig. 5 has been

carried out by calculating the bound- and quasi-bound states of the Li · · · F − H van der

Waals potential that correlate with the HF(v = 0) manifold. The adiabatic potentials

are obtained by constructing the matrix elements of the interaction potential in a basis

set of the rovibrational levels of the HF molecule and diagonalizing the resulting diabatic

potentials as a function of the atom-molecule separation, R. The resonance energies and

the corresponding wave functions are computed using the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method

[75, 76]. For constructing the adiabatic potentials, we used a 20-term Legendre expansion of

the interaction potential, 25 angular orientations to project out the expansion coeﬃcients, 17

Gauss-Hermite quadrature points for the vibrational wave functions and a grid of 1000 points

for the atom-molecule separation. As reported in Table I and Fig. 6, the excellent agreement

found between the energy eigenvalues and the peak positions from our scattering calculations

suggests that peaks A to H in Fig. 6 are resonances due to the decay of metastable states of

the Li · · · HF van der Waals complex. The resonances correspond to quasibound states of the

adiabatic potentials correlating with j = 1 − 4 of the Li · · · HF(v = 0) molecule. Each of the

adiabatic potential supports a number of quasibound complexes due to the relatively deep

van der Waals interaction in the entrance channel. Only high-lying stretching vibrational

states of the van der Waals complex generate resonances for j = 1 (t = 10, 11) and j = 2

8

(t = 5, 6, 8), while low−t channels give rise to resonances for j = 3, 4. However, we have not
been able to assign the strong peak centered at E = 2.539 × 10−1 eV to a reactant van der

Waals complex. Nevertheless, time-delay calculations show that it is a reactive scattering

resonance.

according to

Elastic cross sections for s−wave scattering in Li + HF(v = 0, 1, j = 0) collisions are

presented in Fig. 7 as a function of the incident translational energy. For translational
energies below 10−3 eV elastic cross sections for v = 0 and 1 are nearly identical. Above

this energy value, the results for v = 1 are less oscillatory compared to those of v = 0. The

real part of the scattering length has been calculated for v = 0 and 1 in the ultracold limit

α = − lim
k→0

Im(Sel)
2k

,

(2)

where Sel is the elastic component of the scattering matrix and k is the wavevector corre-
sponding to the initial kinetic energy. We found αv=0 = +11.551 ˚A and αv=1 = +11.535 ˚A

for the real part of the scattering length for v = 0 and 1, respectively.

Fig. 8 shows the J = 0 contribution to the reaction rate coeﬃcients for LiF(v′, j′)

formation in Li + HF(v = 0, 1, j = 0) collisions, evaluated as the product of the cross section

and the relative velocity, as a function of the translational temperature, T = Ekin/kB, where

kB is the Boltzmann constant. The unusually large well depth of the van der Waals potential
in the entrance channel (−0.2407 eV, relative to the Li(2S) + HF asymptote of the PES)

eﬀectively raises the reacton barrier and lead to small values of the reaction rate coeﬃcients

at low energies. For HF(v = 0, j = 0) reactants, the rate coeﬃcient reaches the Wigner
regime for temperatures below 0.03 K, with a constant value of 4.5 × 10−20 cm3 s−1 in

the zero-temperature limit. Vibrational excitation to the v = 1 state enhances reactivity

by 3 orders of magnitude in the ultracold limit, as depicted in the upper panel of Fig. 8,
where a constant value of 2.8 × 10−17 cm3 s−1 is attained for the reaction rate coeﬃcient for

temperatures below 0.005 K. For both v = 0 and 1, the reactivity rapidly increases beyond

1 K. However, accurate prediction of rate coeﬃcients for higher temperatures requires

calculations for J > 0 which is beyond the scope of this work.

IV. CONCLUSION

Quantum reactive scattering calculations have been performed for the Li + HF(v =

0, 1, j = 0) → H + LiF(v′, j′) bimolecular scattering process for zero total angular mo-

mentum, at low and ultralow temperatures. The energy dependence of state-to-state and

initial-state-selected probabilities and cross sections, as well as limiting values of the rate co-

eﬃcients have been evaluated using the coupled-channel hyperspherical coordinate method.

For Li + HF(v = 0, j = 0) collisions, our calculations, using the most recent PES for the

LiHF electronic ground state, clearly illustrate the dominance of the resonance tunneling

mechanism due to the decay of metastable states of the Li· · · HF van der Waals complex in

the entrance valley into the LiF(v′ = 0) product manifold. Comparison of our calculations

with previous quantum scattering results emphasizes the extreme sensitivity of scattering

matrix elements to the details of the PES and therefore the desirability for high accuracy

analytic ﬁts to correctly describe the collision dynamics and the interplay among the various

energy modes in the cold and ultracold regimes. We also ﬁnd that chemical reactivity is

dramatically enhanced by vibrational excitation for cold and ultracold translational energies,

with a 3-order of magnitude increase between the v = 0 and v = 1 rate coeﬃcients in the

zero-temperature limit, consistent with our ﬁndings for the H + HCl and H + DCl reactions

[32]. Moreover, our results show that the LiF formation dominates the nonreactive processes

in Li + HF(v = 1, j = 0) collisions, with a LiF/HF product branching ratio reaching 20 at

low and ultralow temperatures.

The rich resonance features characterizing the energy dependence of the Li + HF cross

sections make the LiHF system particularly attractive for the study of coherent control of

resonance-mediated reactions. In fact, recent advances in the control of bimolecular processes

have shown that cross sections resulting from scattering that proceeds via an intermediate

resonance are exceptionally controllable [77]. This oﬀers new possibility for tuning chemical

reactivity at the single quantum state level of resolution. The present study shows that

vibrational excitation may be used to circumvent reaction barriers at cold and ultracold

temperatures even when the reaction involves tunneling of a heavy atom such as ﬂuorine.

FIG. 1: Translational energy dependence of the reaction probability for LiF(v′, j′) formation in

Li + HF(v = 0, j = 0) collisions for diﬀerent values of ρmax and ∆ρ.

FIG. 2:

State-to-state reaction probability for LiF(v′ = 0, j′) formation as a function of the

product rotational quantum number, j′, in Li + HF(v = 0, j = 0) collisions. Results are presented

for various values of Emax and jmax, at a ﬁxed incident kinetic energy of 10−5 eV, ρmax = 50.0 a.u.,

and ∆ρ = 0.005 a.u.

FIG. 3:

Initial state-selected reaction probability for LiF formation in Li + HF(v = 0, j = 0)

collisions as a function of the total energy. Solid curve: present calculations; dotted curve: quantum

scattering calculation of Lagan`a et al. [51] (extracted graphically from Fig. 3 of ref. [51]).

FIG. 4: State-to-state reaction probabilities for LiF(v′, j′) formation in Li + HF(v = 1, j = 0)

collisions as a function of the product rotational number j′ for a ﬁxed incident kinetic energy of

10−5 eV.

FIG. 5: Cross sections for LiF formation and nonreactive scattering in Li + HF(v, j = 0) collisions,

for v = 0 (lower panel) and v = 1 (upper panel), as a function of the incident kinetic energy.

Dashed curve: nonreactive scattering; solid curve: LiF product channel.

FIG. 6: Adiabatic potential energy curves and corresponding quasibound levels of the Li · · · HF(v =

0, j) van der Waals complex (left panel); cross section for LiF formation in Li + HF(v = 0, j = 0)

collisions as a function of the total energy (right panel). The resonances A to H in the cross section

appear as a result of the decay of quasibound states of the Li· · · HF van der Waals complex.

FIG. 7: Elastic cross sections for s−wave scattering in Li + HF(v = 0, 1, j = 0) collisions as a

function of the incident kinetic energy. Solid curve: v = 0; dashed curve: v = 1.

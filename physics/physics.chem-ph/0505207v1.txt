The Generalized Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (GRECP) method is described which allows
one to simulate Breit interaction and ﬁnite nuclear models by an economic way and with high accu-
racy. The corresponding GRECPs for the uranium, plutonium, eka-mercury (E112), eka-thallium
(E113) and eka-lead (E114) atoms are generated. The accuracy of these GRECPs and of the RECPs
of other groups is estimated in atomic numerical SCF calculations with Coulomb two-electron inter-
actions and point nucleus as compared to the corresponding all-electron Hartree-Fock-Dirac-Breit
calculations with the Fermi nuclear charge distribution. Diﬀerent nuclear models and contributions
of the Breit interaction between diﬀerent shells are studied employing all-electron four-component
methods.

Introduction

Investigation of physical and chemical properties of recently synthesized relatively long-living isotopes of superheavy
elements (SHEs) with the nuclear charges Z=105 to 116 [1, 2, 3, 4] and their compounds is of fundamental importance
for science. Their experimental lifetimes reach several hours now and the nuclei near the top of the “island of stability”
are predicted to exist for many years. The experimental study of SHE properties is very diﬃcult because of their
extremely small quantities, only single atoms are available for research. Accurate calculations for SHEs and their
compounds are needed in order to better understand their physical and chemical properties that often diﬀer from
those of the lighter homologs in the chemical groups due to very strong relativistic eﬀects on their electronic shells.
Besides, for elements decaying by spontaneous ﬁssion, the chemical identiﬁcation is the only way to prove their Z
number.

Experimental investigations of spectroscopic and other physical-chemical properties of actinides are severely ham-
pered by their radioactive decay and radiation which lead to chemical modiﬁcations of the systems under study. The
diversity of properties of lanthanide and actinide compounds is unique due to the multitude of their valency forms
(which can vary over a wide range) and because of particular importance of relativistic eﬀects. They are, therefore,
of great interest both for fundamental research and for development of new technologies and materials. The most
important practical problems involve storage and processing of radioactive waste and nuclear fuel, as well as pollution
of the environment by radioactive waste, where most of the decayed elements are actinides.

From the formal point of view, four-component correlation calculations [5, 6] based on Dirac-Coulomb-Breit (DCB)
Hamiltonian (see [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and references) can provide a very high accuracy of physical and chemical properties
for molecules containing heavy atoms. However, such calculations were not widely used for such systems during last
decade because of the following theoretical and technical complications [12]:

- too many electrons are treated explicitly in heavy-atom systems and too large number of Gaussians is required

for accurate description of the large number of oscillations, which valence spinors have in heavy atoms;

- the necessity to work with four-component Dirac spinors leads to serious complication of calculations as compared

to the nonrelativistic case:

(a) the number of kinetically-balanced two-component (“2c”) uncontracted Gaussian basis spinors for the
Small components, N 2c
L is the number of basis spinors for Large
components; so the total number of uncontracted Gaussian basis spinors in the relativistic four-component
(“4c”) calculations N 4c

S , can be estimated as 2N 2c

L and the number of two-electron integrals as [12]

L , where N 2c

bas ∼ 3N 2c

N 4c

2eInt ≡ 25·N 2c

Note, however, that the situation is seriously improved here during last years, see [5, 6, 13, 14].

(b) the number of basis 2c-spinors, N 2c

(“1c”) orbitals, N 1c

bas, is twice more than the number of nonrelativistic basis one-component

N 2c

The minimal number of two-electron integrals in the spin-orbit basis set, which are required to be saved
coincides, obviously, with N 1c

2eInt.

The Relativistic Eﬀective Core Potential (RECP) method is most widely used in calculations on molecules containing
heavy atoms [15, 16] because it reduces drastically the computational cost at the integral generation, SCF and integral

operator (used by many groups up to now but suggested and ﬁrst applied about 40 years ago [20, 21, 22]) was shown
to be limited by accuracy and some nonlocal corrections to the RECP operator were suggested [17, 19, 23, 24], which
have already allowed us to improve signiﬁcantly the RECP accuracy [18, 19, 25, 26].

It is known that the Breit interaction can give contributions in excess of one thousand wave numbers even to
energies of transitions between lowest-lying states of very heavy elements (see, e.g., tables IV and V). It is also clear
that the point nuclear model becomes less appropriate when the nuclear charge is increased. Therefore, the RECPs
designed for accurate calculations of actinide and SHE compounds should allow one to take into account the Breit
interaction and the ﬁnite size of nuclei. The most economic way is to incorporate the corresponding contributions
into the RECP operator.

I. GENERALIZED RECP METHOD

In a series of papers (see [17, 18, 19, 24, 27] and references), we introduced and developed the Generalized RECP

(GRECP) method. Its main features are:

• The inner core (IC), outer core (OC) and valence (V) electrons are ﬁrst treated employing diﬀerent approxima-
tions for each (including relaxation of the IC shells which are explicitly excluded from GRECP calculations).

• GRECP involves both radially-local, separable and Huzinaga-type potentials as its components and particular

cases.

and actinides (see sections I A–I B).

the GRECP components [28].

• The GRECP operator includes terms of other types for economical treatment of transition metals, lanthanides

• The outer core pseudospinors (nodeless) together with valence pseudospinors (nodal) are used for constructing

• Quantum electrodynamics eﬀects (see [29] and section I C), arbitrary nuclear models, and correlation with IC

shells [30] can be eﬃciently treated within GRECPs.

The GRECP method is described in detail in the above papers and we only add here that it allows one to avoid
the complications of the four-component calculations described in the introduction (see also [30]) and to attain very
high accuracy, limited in practice by possibilities of the correlation methods, while requiring moderate computational
eﬀorts when the IC, OC and V subspaces are appropriately chosen.

The contributions of diﬀerent nuclear models which are described by local potentials can be easily taken into account
in the framework of the (G)RECP method. The situation is more complicated in the case of the Breit interaction
because it is represented by a two-electron operator. General justiﬁcation of the possibility to simulate the Breit eﬀects
by means of an one-electron (G)RECP operator with good accuracy and the scheme of such GRECP generation are
presented in [29] (see also section I C). This scheme is applied in the present work to generate GRECPs for the
uranium, plutonium, eka-mercury (E112), eka-thallium (E113) and eka-lead (E114) atoms. The 32, 34, 20, 21 and
22 electrons are explicitly treated in calculations with these GRECPs, correspondingly. Moreover, the 52 electron
GRECP (52e-GRECP) version for E112 was also generated. The conventional Coulomb operator for two-electron
interactions and the point nuclear model should be used in these GRECP calculations. However, they will account
for the Fermi nuclear charge model that is close to the experimental distribution. Moreover, the Breit interactions of
the electrons from the state used for the GRECP generation with the electrons explicitly treated in the subsequent
calculations are simulated by the GRECP (in some sense, the Breit interaction is “frozen” here).

A. Self-consistent GRECP version for d- and f -elements

The Self-Consistent (SfC) (G)RECP version [19, 23, 24, 27] allows one to minimize errors for energies of transitions
with the change of the occupation numbers for the OuterMost Core (OMC) shells without extension of space of
explicitly treated electrons.
It allows one to take account of relaxation of those core shells, which are explicitly
excluded from the GRECP calculations, thus going beyond the frozen core approximation. This method is most
optimal for studying compounds of transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides. Features of constructing the self-
consistent GRECP are:

1. The all-electron HFDB calculations of two generator states with diﬀerent occupation numbers N1 and N2 of the

OMC d or f shell are carried out for an d- or f -element.

2. The GRECP versions with separable correction UN1 and UN2 are constructed for these generator states em-
ploying the standard scheme [17, 18, 19, 24]. The GRECP operator with the separable correction has the

B. Term-splitting correction for d, f -elements

3/27s2

5/26d1

The self-consistent (G)RECP correction gives no improvement in description of splittings to terms, e.g., of the
conﬁguration 5f 3
1/2 of uranium as compared to the parent (G)RECPs [19, 24]. Analysis of the corresponding
errors shows that the main contribution (about 90 %) is due to smoothing the original OMC spinors in the core
region. The simplest way to minimize these errors is to use such (G)RECPs, in which the 5f shell is described by
nodal pseudospinors, whereas the 4f pseudospinors are nodeless. To reduce computational eﬀorts, the 4f shell can
be treated as “frozen” using the level-shift technique [19, 31].

If the small magnitude of the OMC shell (5f here) relaxation is taken into account, there is another way out that
can be optimal for the low-lying states. It was suggested in [19] to add the Term-Splitting (TS) correction (see also
[24]) to the (G)RECP operator

where λx1x2,x3x4 is the diﬀerence between the two-electron integrals calculated with original spinors and pseudospinors
for the generator state, the indices w ≡ (noccloccjoccmocc) correspond to the occupied spinors for the calculated state,
the indices x ≡ (nomclomcjm) run over all possible j = |lomc ± 1/2| and m = −j, −j + 1, . . . j for the given OMC
shell. These terms correct the one- and two-electron integrals containing only the 5f pseudospinors of uranium in the
considered case.

C. Accounting for the Breit interaction between diﬀerent shells

Let us analyze contributions of the Breit interaction between electrons from diﬀerent shells to the energy of a heavy

atom [27]. We will use the estimate (e.g., see [32])

Let us consider approximations in accounting for the Breit interaction, that we made when outer core and valence
electrons are included in GRECP calculations with Coulomb two-electron interactions, but inner core electrons are
absorbed into the GRECP. When both electrons belong to the inner core shells, the Breit eﬀect is of the same order
as the Coulomb interaction between them. Though Bf f ′ does not contribute to “diﬀerential” (valence) properties
directly, it can lead to essential relaxation of both core and valence shells. This relaxation is taken into account when
the Breit interaction is treated by self-consistent way in the framework of the HFDB method [33, 34].

The inner core electrons occupy closed shells. The only exchange part of the two-electron Breit interaction between
the valence, outer core and inner core electrons, Bf v and Bf c, gives non-zero contribution. The contributions from
Bf v and Bf c, are quite essential for calculation at the level of “chemical accuracy” (about 1 kcal/mol or 350 cm−1 for
transition energies). This accuracy level is, in general, determined by the possibilities of modern correlation methods
and computers already for compounds of light elements. Note, that the contribution from the exchange interaction
is not smaller than that from the Coulomb part [29]. The inner core electrons can be considered as “frozen” in most
physical-chemical processes of interest. Therefore, the eﬀective operators for Bf v and Bf c acting on the valence and
outercore shells, BEf
f c , are of the same kind as the exchange f −v and f −c contributions of the SCF ﬁeld in
the Huzinaga-type potential, i.e. these terms can be well approximated by the spin-dependent potential of the form:

which has basically the same spin-angular structure as the GRECP has. Thus, it can be taken into account directly
when the HFDB (not HFD) calculation [8] is performed to generate outer core and valence bispinors but in the
inversion procedure of the HF equations for generating the components of GRECP, the conventional interelectronic
Coulomb interaction should be used instead of the Coulomb-Breit one. Then, in the GRECP calculations one should
consider only the Coulomb interaction between the explicitly treated electrons.

c , Z ∗

Due to small relaxation of outer core shells in most processes of interest, these shells can be also considered as
“frozen” when analyzing the Breit contributions and the Bcc′ and Bcv terms can be taken into account similarly to
the Bf c and Bf v ones. The error of this approximation will be additionally suppressed by relative weakness of the
Breit interaction with the outer core electrons as compared to the inner core ones. We note here, that the estimates
for Z ∗
v and, therefore, for Bcc′, Bcv and Bvv′ given above are rather the upper limits. For heavy atoms these
Breit contributions are smaller approximately by one–two orders of magnitude. This decrease is due to enlarged radii
of the valence and outer core shells and other eﬀects in heavy atoms [29]. For example, for uranium (Z = 92) one has
Z ∗
1s grows faster than Z due to relativistic eﬀects,
nl is essentially smaller than the corresponding eﬀective charge Z Ef
whereas Z ∗
6p∼0.7,
Z ∗
6d∼0.4, Z ∗
7s∼0.3. Thus, Bcc′, Bcv, and Bvv′ contributions are negligible for the “chemical accuracy” of calculation.
Therefore, the above made estimates provide us a good background for approximating the Breit interaction by a
one-electron GRECP operator that should work well both for actinides and for superheavy elements. The numerical
tests of the GRECPs accounting for the Breit eﬀects are discussed in the next section.

II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

6

For all-electron calculations, we used the atomic HFDB code [35, 36] which allows one to account for the Breit
interactions both in the framework of the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory (PT-1) and by the self-consistent way as well
as to account for diﬀerent models of nuclear charge distribution. For test calculations with (G)RECPs, the atomic
Hartree-Fock code in the jj-coupling scheme (hfj) [17] was used (that was quite suﬃcient for studying errors of the
one-electron (G)RECP operators). Both the codes are numerical that allows us to exclude the errors due to the
incompleteness of basis sets when estimating accuracy of diﬀerent RECPs and GRECPs.

The transition energies between states averaged over the low-lying conﬁgurations of SHEs 112, 113, 114 and actinides
U, Pu are presented in tables I, II, III and IV, V, respectively. One can see that the errors due to the point nuclear
model reach a few thousand wave numbers for the SHEs and several hundred wave numbers for the actinides. The
considered small variations in the nuclear charge distribution (including the nuclear size) in the framework of ﬁnite-size
nuclei lead to change of the transition energies for the studied SHEs less than on 60 cm−1. The diﬀerences between
the results with the PT-1 and self-consistent ways of accounting for the Breit interaction are within 7 cm−1 for SHEs
and actinides whereas neglecting the Breit eﬀects leads to the errors up to a few thousand wave numbers for the
studied actinides and several hundred wave numbers for the SHEs.

The GRECP errors in reproducing the results of the all-electron HFDB calculations with the Fermi nuclear model
are collected into two groups. First, the GRECP errors for transitions without change in the occupation number of
the 6d shell for the SHEs (tables I, II and III) and the 5f shell for the actinides (tables IV and V) are relatively small
whereas the corresponding errors of the other tested RECPs for the SHEs are signiﬁcantly higher. The same number
of electrons is explicitly treated in calculations with diﬀerent (G)RECP versions for a given atom. Here and further,
we do not discuss the particular case of the 52e-GRECP for E112 if the opposite is not explicitly stated. The RECPs
of other groups for uranium were tested in paper [19]. It should be noted that they do not take into account the
large contribution from the Breit interaction. The Breit eﬀects were also not considered at the generation stage of the
RECP of Nash et al. [37]. However, it can not explain the large errors for this RECP in tables I, II and III. It is not
clear from paper [37] which nuclear model was used there. The Breit interaction was taken into account only in the
PT-1 approximation at the generation stage of the PseudoPotential (PP) of Seth et al. However, the corresponding
changes in the transition energies are negligible in comparison with the PP errors.

Second, the GRECP errors for transitions with excitation of one 6d electron for the SHEs or one 5f electron for the
actinides are about 400 cm−1. These errors have a systematic nature (unlike the corresponding errors for the tested
RECPs of other groups) and are connected with the fact that the OMC 6d shell for the SHEs and the OMC 5f shell
for the actinides in the present GRECP versions are described with the help of nodeless pseudospinors. Obviously,
these errors can be reduced signiﬁcantly if one includes the 5d, 5f electrons for the SHEs and the 4f electrons for the
actinides explicitly in the GRECP calculations (see the 52e-GRECP results for E112 in table I). The corresponding
pseudospinors can be then “frozen” in these GRECP calculations with the help of the level-shift technique [19, 31] to
reduce the computational eﬀorts. Alternatively, the self-consistent GRECP method described in section I A can be
used.

The energies of splittings between terms are considered in table VI for E112 and table VII for U. The errors of the
RECP and GRECP approximations and the errors caused by neglecting the Breit eﬀects are within 200 cm−1 for E112
(except for the RECP of Nash et al.). The Breit contributions to the term-splitting energies for U are within 100 cm−1
whereas the GRECP errors are up to 750 cm−1. The latter can be reduced drastically by applying the term-splitting
correction (see section I B and table VII). The results show that addition of the term-splitting correction allows
one to reduce the most serious errors up to 10 times for the splittings into terms, thus reducing the errors for the
energies of transition between terms to the same order of magnitude as the errors for transitions between the states
averaged over the conﬁgurations (when only the self-consistent GRECP is applied). Obviously, any transition between
two diﬀerent terms having diﬀerent occupation numbers of the OMC shell, N1
omc, can be presented as a
combination of three consequent transitions: transiton from the ﬁrst term to the average over the conﬁguration with
the same N1
omc and transition from the latter
to the second term with N2
omc. Therefore, applying of both the self-consistent and term-spitting GRECP corrections
to treatment of transitions between any terms allows one to reduce dramatically the (G)RECP approximation errors
without increasing the number of explicitly treated core electrons of a considered d, f -element.

ϕnv lj(r)] | dr
(where fnv lj is the large component of the Dirac spinor,
ϕnv lj is the radial part of the corresponding pseudospinor
and Rn is the radius of the last spinor node) are considered for the cases of spinors from diﬀerent conﬁgurations of
e
E112. The errors in these matrix elements and integrals characterize the quality of reproducing the electronic density
in outer core and valence regions of the atom. One can see that the GRECP allows one to reproduce the electronic
density in the valence region (the 7s1/2 and 7p1/2 spinors) with very high accuracy. The one-electron energies for
spinors from diﬀerent conﬁgurations of E112 are presented in table X. Similar conclusion can be made in the latter

Conclusions

Diﬀerent nuclear models and contributions of the Breit interaction between valence, inner and outer core shells of
uranium, plutonium and superheavy elements E112, E113, and E114 are considered in the framework of all-electron
four-component and (G)RECP methods. It is concluded on the basis of the performed calculations and theoretical
analysis that the Breit contributions with inner core shells must be taken into account in calculations of actinide and
SHE compounds with “chemical accuracy” whereas those between valence and outer core shells can be omitted.

The diﬀerences in the atomic energies between the cases of the PT-1 and self-consistent ways of treating the Breit
interaction as well as small variations in the nuclear charge distribution in the framework of ﬁnite-size nuclei are not
essential for the considered accuracy of calculations. However, the diﬀerence between the point and ﬁnite nuclear
models is important for the valence (transition) energies. The eﬀects of accounting for the Breit interaction and
ﬁnite nuclear model can be simulated by GRECPs with very good accuracy when only Coulomb interaction between
the explicitly treated electrons is taken into account. Thus, the GRECP method allows one to carry out reliable
calculations of actinides, SHEs and their compounds at the level of “chemical accuracy”.

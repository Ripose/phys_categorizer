We consider the calculation of quantum mechanical rate constants for chemical reactions via
algorithms that utilize short time values of the symmetrized ﬂux-ﬂux correlation function. We
argue that the dividing surface that makes optimal use of the short time quantum information is
the surface that minimizes the value at the origin of the symmetrized ﬂux-ﬂux correlation function.
We also demonstrate that, in the classical limit, this quantum variational criterion produces the same
dividing surface as Wigner’s variational principle. Finally, we argue that the quantum variational
criterion behaves in a nearly optimal fashion with respect to the minimization of the extent of
re-crossing ﬂux.

INTRODUCTION

It is well recognized that the rate constant for a chem-
ical reaction can be written as the time integral of a ﬂux
autocorrelation function,1,2,3,4

where we write the correlation function ﬁrst in a slightly
more general form than usual,

(2)

with the value of λ being restricted to the interval [0, β].
Qr(T ) is the reactant partition function, per unit volume
for a bimolecular reaction. We assume that the Hamilto-
nian of the system is Cartesian and, for simplicity, that
the coordinates are scaled so that the mass is the same
for each degree of freedom [i.e., ˆH = ˆp2/2m0 + V (ˆx)].
The ﬂux operator ˆF is then given by

operator and s(x) is a function of coordinates that is
negative (positive) on the reactant (product) side. This
function deﬁnes the dividing surface (DS) via the equa-
tion

s(x) = 0.

By its very construction, the ﬂux operator is Hermitian,
i.e., ˆF † = ˆF .

It was pointed out by Miller, Schwartz, and Tromp
(MST)3 that the rate constant given by Eq. (1) is inde-
pendent of the choice of λ in the correlation function of
Eq. (2), though the correlation function itself is not. The
early work of Yamamoto1 used the Kubo form of the cor-
relation function, which corresponds to averaging Eq. (2)

over λ from 0 to β. MST used a correlation function that
corresponds to the choice λ = β/2. The Kubo form of
Yamamoto is sometimes more useful,5,6 and other times
that of MST. The “nice” features of the latter are that
the Boltzmann operators are combined with the time evo-
lution operators in a symmetric fashion

which has facilitated approximations based on analytic
continuation7,8,9,10 or inverse moment11 approaches. For
purposes in this paper, it is of central importance that the
MST correlation function is ﬁnite at t = 0, whereas the
Kubo one diverges there.3,4 In the limit ~
0, the value
of the MST correlation function at t = 0 diverges (as it
should) at a rate that is proportional to the classical tran-
sition state theory (TST) reaction rate, kcl,T ST (T )Qr(T ),
as described by the equation

CF (0) =

kcl,T ST (T )Qr(T ) [1 + O(~)] .

This connection with classical transition state theory is
proved in Section IV and constitutes one of the argu-
ments demonstrating the suitability of the MST correla-
tion function for the computation of quantum reaction
rates.

Another general feature of Eqs. (1) and (2) is that the
rate constant is independent of the location of the divid-
ing surface, although the correlation function itself is not.
This is true, of course, only if the quantum dynamics (i.e.,
the time evolution operators) is generated to times long
enough for the integral of CF (t) to converge. Because
of this, some dividing surfaces are better than others,
for practical purposes. Curve (a) in Fig. 1, for example,
shows the sketch of the ﬂux-ﬂux correlation function (of
the MST type) for a “direct” reaction, where the DS has
been chosen in a location so that there is no “re-crossing
ﬂux,” i.e., so that it is positive for all t
0. Curve (b)
in Fig. 1, on the other hand, shows the correlation func-
tion with the DS located in a region for which there is

re-crossing ﬂux (corresponding classically to trajectories
that begin on the DS at t = 0 and re-cross it at some later
time). As noted, the integrals of the two correlation func-
tions in Fig. 1 are the same, but the practical advantages
of choosing the DS as in case (a) are clear, particularly if
CF (t) is calculated by some procedure that has a signif-
icant numerical error associated with it (as will almost
always be the case). In case (b) of Fig. 1, the integral of
CF (t), i.e., the rate constant, is given by the diﬀerence
of two usually very large numbers, the integral of the
positive part minus that of the negative part, whereas in
case (a), there is no such cancellation. In this respect,
notice that the magnitude of the correlation function in
case (b) is at least 20 times larger than the magnitude of
the correlation function in case (a), although the divid-
ing surface is only slightly displaced from the top of the
barrier (about half the thickness of the barrier).

The beneﬁt of choosing the DS to eliminate (or at
least minimize) the re-crossing ﬂux is even more criti-
cal if one uses an approximate rate theory that is based
on a short-time approximation to CF (t) that assumes
there is no re-crossing ﬂux, i.e., some kind of transition
state-like theory, such as the recent “quantum instanton”
approximation12 and its extensions.13 It is clear that a
TST-type approximation would be totally inappropriate
for case (b) of Fig. 1, while quite appropriate for the situ-
ation in case (a). In classical mechanics, these considera-
tions lead to the well-known Wigner variational criterion
for choosing the “best” dividing surface, namely the one
which makes the TST rate constant a minimum.14,15,16,17
The object of this paper is to obtain a criterion for
choosing the “best” DS for the quantum mechanical case,
under the assumption that only short-time information

2

will be available for CF (t). Such a criterion corresponds
most closely to Wigner’s classical variational principle
and, in fact, we shall see that Wigner’s principle is re-
covered in the classical limit. In order to apply to most
approaches that avoid the evaluation of the long-time dy-
namics, the quantum variational criterion is developed
starting solely from the assumption that the exact eval-
uation of the rate of reaction is desired, but only short-
time information is available. The rationale behind the
quantum criterion is to maximize the contribution of the
short-time correlation function to the value of the quan-
tum reaction rate. However, because of this, we expect
the variational criterion to produce surfaces of minimal
re-crossing ﬂux, for which the long-time dynamics re-
sults in nearly negligible values of the ﬂux autocorrela-
tion function at long times. Therefore, such a variational
criterion is expected to be useful whether one is actually
computing CF (t) for some ﬁnite time, or using an approx-
imate rate theory based on a short-time approximation
that neglects the possibility of re-crossing eﬀects.

To preview our basic result somewhat, we refer again
to the sketch in Fig. 1. The correlation function with the
larger value of CF (0) has a larger area under its posi-
tive region, and so, it must have a larger area under its
negative region since the time integrals of the two corre-
lation functions are the same. It is then intuitively clear
that the dividing surface with no (or, at least, minimal)
re-crossing ﬂux will be the one for which CF (0) is a mini-
mum, and this is precisely the criterion we propose. The
reader may have anticipated our proposal from Eq. (6)
and from the aforementioned requirement that the varia-
tional criterion must transform into Wigner’s variational
principle in the limit ~
0. From the very beginning,
we observe that the proposed quantum criterion is quite
practical to implement since it involves no real-time dy-
namics. The goal of the remainder of the paper is to
develop this idea as generally and as rigorously as possi-
ble.

II. MOTIVATING THE NEED FOR AN
“OPTIMAL” DIVIDING SURFACE

As mentioned in the Introduction, the reaction rate
is invariant to the particular choice of dividing surface,
so long as the surface separates reactants from products.
The calculation of reaction rates can be greatly simpli-
ﬁed, however, if an “optimal” choice for the dividing sur-
face is made. Strictly speaking, the optimal dividing sur-
face is the one that minimizes the computational cost
for a particular algorithm that is utilized to evaluate the
integral

k(T )Qr(T ) =

CF (t)dt.

(7)

∞

Z
0

Such an optimal dividing surface is useful in practice,
of course, only if the computational time necessary to
ﬁnd the surface is not greater than the time necessary to

evaluate the right-hand side of Eq. (7). It appears that
there is no universal deﬁnition for the dividing surface,
since this surface is algorithm dependent.

t1 < t2 <

Even so, as we shall see, certain features common to all
known algorithms lead to very general criteria for identi-
fying nearly optimal dividing surfaces. Because the diﬃ-
cult part in evaluating the integral appearing in Eq. (7) is
the calculation of the correlation function CF (t) at cer-
tain quadrature points 0
,
∞
≤
the optimal dividing surface depends on the algorithms
utilized to compute the ﬂux autocorrelation function.
However, all known algorithms that attempt to evalu-
ate the ﬂux autocorrelation function for arbitrarily long
times suﬀer from the so-called “dynamical sign prob-
lem.” Thus, the computational time necessary to eval-
uate CF (t) with a prescribed absolute error increases at
least exponentially with the inverse error as well as with
certain physical parameters, such as the time t
0 and
the dimensionality of the system.18

< tn <

· · ·

≥

Actually, the ﬂux autocorrelation function can be
evaluated in a stable way by means of Monte Carlo
imaginary-time path-integral simulations, but only for
times shorter than β~/2.11 As can be demonstrated by
analytical continuation19 or probabilistic arguments,11
the values for longer times and, therefore, the reaction
rate are uniquely determined by the values of the ﬂux-ﬂux
correlation function on the interval [0, β~/2). However,
the errors for the long-time quantities increase exponen-
tially with the errors in the values of the short-time cor-
relation function for all known reconstruction techniques
(such reconstruction techniques involve unstable inverse
problems, such as inverse real Laplace transforms9,10 or
inverse moment problems11).

Given this state of aﬀairs, it becomes apparent that
algorithms and dividing surfaces that make best use of
the available short-time information have certain numer-
ical advantages. At this stage, the sentence “that makes
best use of the short-time information” is quite ambigu-
ous, but we shall make deﬁnite sense of it in the following
section. However, the sentence underlies one of the main
assumptions of the present paper: that algorithms rely-
~β/2) quantum
ing on the calculation of long-time (t
dynamics are less eﬃcient in comparison with those only
requiring short-time (t < ~β/2) information.

Parenthetically, we observe that if long-time dynamics
were an option, then the obvious choice for a nearly op-
timal solution would be the surface that minimizes the

ror only, one must minimize the sum of the two positive

ference. In this way, the relative error of the diﬀerence is
also minimized.

The general rule of numerical analysis utilized above is
that we must avoid the calculation of various quantities
as diﬀerences of two positive large numbers, to prevent
loss of precision. In this respect, it is worth noting that

may increase rapidly to very large values upon the vari-
ation of the parameters controlling the position and the
shape of the dividing surface (parameters denoted col-
lectively by a), especially at low temperature. The situ-
ation is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we have plotted the
logarithm of the ratio pF (a) as a function of the displace-
ment a, for a low temperature one dimensional asymmet-
ric Eckart barrier.

From the discussion in the preceding paragraphs, it is
clear that ﬁnding the optimal dividing surface is a cru-
cial step in the calculation of any rate of reaction. We
have also argued that the minimization of the quantity
given by Eq. (8) leads to a nearly optimal dividing sur-
face. Even so, there is one important objection that must
be raised against the use of Eq. (8): one is required to
perform a long-time dynamical simulation anyway, in or-
der to compute the very functional that is minimized.
Although the necessary precision is relative to the value

and not to the value of the ﬁnal reaction rate, the cal-
culation is still not feasible because of the notorious sign
problem.

But even for classical systems, there is a zero-time cri-
terion that is a better computational choice than the
time-integral of the absolute value of the ﬂux autocorre-
lation function. This criterion is provided by Wigner’s
variational principle,14,15,16,17 the computation useful-
ness of which has long been established by numerous
applications.20 Wigner’s variational principle asserts that
the instantaneous ﬂux of particles through any surface
separating products from reactants is an upper bound of
the true reaction rate. The principle is applied by cal-
culating the TST reaction rate with the dividing surface
at diﬀerent locations. The lowest rate calculated is the
best estimate of the true reaction rate, although the lat-
ter quantity is not always attained. In the present paper,
we suggest that the surface that minimizes the TST rate
of reaction is also a nearly optimal dividing surface for
the problem of minimizing the cost of computing the in-
tegral appearing in Eq. (7). That Wigner’s variational
principle leads to computationally nearly optimal divid-
ing surfaces can be inferred from the fact that, for those
surfaces for which no or minimal re-crossings occur, the
most important contribution to the ﬂux-ﬂux correlation
function comes from a delta function positioned at t = 0.
In these conditions,

to a good degree. Therefore, Wigner’s variational princi-
ple and the variational criterion based on the minimiza-
tion of the time integral of the absolute value of the ﬂux-
ﬂux correlation function should lead to nearly identical
optimal dividing surfaces. In fact, these optimal dividing
surfaces are strictly the same for those systems for which
the TST theory becomes an exact theory.

But how about quantum systems? As mentioned in the
Introduction, we propose the minimization of the MST
correlation function at t = 0, CF (0), as a criterion likely
to produce a nearly optimal dividing surface. To sup-
port our proposal through a numerical experiment, let
us deﬁne the ratio

in analogy to Eq. (10). As it can be seen from Fig. 2,
the common logarithm of qF (a) mimics very closely the
behavior of the same quantity for pF (a).
In fact, the
two minimization criteria produce almost the same lo-
cation of the dividing point, namely a0 ≈ −
0.44. At
least in the limit ~
0, the excellent behavior of the
→
optimality criterion based on CF (0) can be understood

via Wigner’s variational principle, in which it transforms
(as demonstrated in Section IV). The argument for the
general quantum case is given in the next section.

III. THE RATIONALE FOR THE CF (0)
QUANTUM VARIATIONAL CRITERION

In this section, we present the rationale for the quan-
tum variational criterion based on the minimization of
the value of the ﬂux autocorrelation function at the ori-
gin. We commence with a short summary of the main
line of thought. We point out that short-time informa-
tion is extremely redundant, although it completely de-
termines the values of the ﬂux autocorrelation function
at all later times. A more suitable set of short-time data
is the sequence of even derivatives at the origin of the
correlation function. These derivatives are positive and
represent the moments of the spectral function associated
with the ﬂux autocorrelation function. We shall assume
that we are able to compute these moments with any de-
sired relative accuracy, although this assumption is still
not suﬃcient for a reliable determination of the rate of
reaction. The reason for the insuﬃciency is that the rate
of reaction is obtained as the result of an inverse moment
problem. The solution of such a problem is known to be
unstable with respect to small relative errors in the input
data. As such, any algorithm designed to approximate
the solution of the inﬁnite moment problem by matching
a ﬁnite number of moments becomes less and less sta-
ble in the limit of large number of matched moments. To
compensate for this instability, one is required to increase
the accuracy in the determination of the moments, a re-
quirement that underlies the redundancy of the moment
information.

For the problem of computing reaction rates, where
only the value of the ﬂux-ﬂux spectral function near the
origin is important, the redundancy in the moment infor-
mation and, therefore the instability of the inverse mo-
ment problem, are caused by the fact that the high-order
moment information comes from frequency regions that
are far away from the origin. This state of aﬀairs, which
is illustrated in Fig. 3 for the case of a free particle, is in-
dependent of the nature of the algorithm utilized for the
resolution of the ﬁnite moment problem. It follows that
the deﬁnite way of stabilizing the results for all inversion
algorithms is by working with the dividing surface for
which the main information contained in the moments
comes from frequency regions that are as close as pos-
In this section, we argue that the

surface that minimizes the value of the ﬂux-ﬂux correla-
tion function at the origin is optimal in this respect.

It can be shown by analytical continuation19 or by
probabilistic arguments11 that any short-time informa-
tion of the autocorrelation function [that is, knowledge
of the ﬂux autocorrelation function CF (t) for all times
0
ǫ up to an arbitrary ǫ > 0] uniquely determines
the autocorrelation function. Therefore, at least in prin-

ciple, the absolute rate of reaction can be recovered from
0
such short-time information. Because in the limit ǫ
all values of CF (t) tend to CF (0) by the continuity of
the autocorrelation function at the origin, it is easy to
see that the short-time information is highly redundant,
that it must be computed with very high accuracy, and
that all useful knowledge is actually contained in the way
the values of CF (t) for various times t
[0, ǫ] relate one to
each other. After straightforward algebraic transforma-
tions via certain ﬁnite-diﬀerence schemes, the short-time
information can be more suitably used in the form of
the sequence of derivatives at the origin of the ﬂux auto-
correlation function. In this respect, we mention that it
can be proved under quite general assumptions that the
ﬂux autocorrelation function is analytical at the origin,
with a radius of convergence of β~/2.11 Therefore, with-
out loss of generality, by “short-time information,” we
shall understand the sequence of derivatives at the origin
of the ﬂux autocorrelation function or, equivalently (see
Eq. 15), the sequence of moments of the ﬂux-ﬂux spec-
tral density. This deﬁnition has the additional advantage
that it no longer requires the utilization of the arbitrary
ǫ > 0 parameter introduced above.

The spectral density of the ﬂux autocorrelation func-

tion is given by the Fourier transform

The problem that we are given to solve is a very dif-
ﬁcult inverse moment problem: recover the value of the
spectral density at the origin ¯CF (0) (the spectral function
is assumed continuous near the origin) given the moments
of the spectral density. It is no news that such a prob-
lem is ill-posed both because the ﬁnite moment problem
is not uniquely determined, but also because the inﬁ-
nite moment problem is not stable with respect to small
relative errors in the moment data. The ﬁnite moment
problem can be regularized by choosing that solution that
is physically more relevant or for which the stability of
the resulting inverse problem is the largest. However, in
the limit that the number of matched moments goes to
inﬁnity, all ﬁnite inverse problems become unstable, no
matter how good the regularization algorithm is. This
is so because the inﬁnite moment problem is not stable.
The cause of this instability is the redundancy of the
moment information.

The redundancy of the moment information with re-
spect to the values of the ﬂux-ﬂux spectral density near
the origin can be understood by looking at the values of
the normalized positive functions

¯CF (ω)ω2k/D2k,

for increasing k’s. As illustrated in Fig. 3 for the case of a
quantum free particle, the main contribution of the values
of ¯CF (ω) to the high order moments comes from regions
that are further and further away from the origin, as the
order of the moments increases. This behavior can be ex-
plained by observing that the polynomial ω2k increases
ever more rapidly with ω, as the value of k increases. As
illustrated in Fig. 4, by varying the location of the di-
viding surface, the frequency regions that contribute the
most to the moment values can be made closer or fur-
ther from the origin. By making these regions as close as
possible to the origin, we can diminish the redundancy of
the moment information with respect to the calculation
of the ﬂux-ﬂux spectral density near the origin. In or-
der to move the important regions closer to the origin for
moments of all orders, we must increase the importance
of ¯CF (ω) near the origin, as measured relatively to the
importance of ¯CF (ω) away from the origin.

The spectral density is symmetric in the variable ω.
Therefore, its odd moments are zero. Its even moments

In other words, by varying the dividing surface asso-
ciated with the ﬂux operator ˆF , we must maximize the

the result of the maximization against ˆF is not aﬀected
by a multiplication with ǫ−1, we may equivalently maxi-

imum, the degeneracy can be resolved by analyzing the

completely resolved, one must look to the correction term
of order ǫ2, and so on. In this paper, we shall assume that
such a degeneracy does not appear. If it does appear in
practical applications, we choose one of the maxima ran-
domly.

At this point, it is useful to remember that the spec-
tral density ¯CF (ω) is continuous at the origin and that its
value at the origin is independent of the dividing surface.
This state of aﬀairs is depicted in Fig. 5, where we have
plotted the spectral densities for two diﬀerent dividing
surfaces for a low-temperature asymmetric Eckart bar-
rier. As a consequence of these properties and of Eq. (16),
we have

Eq. (17) represents the main result of the section.
It
shows that the surface that minimizes the redundancy
of the moment information with respect to the evalua-
tion of the quantum rate of reaction is the surface that
minimizes the value of the ﬂux autocorrelation function
at the origin. This conclusion is independent of the na-
ture of the algorithms utilized for the regularization and
inversion of the ﬁnite moment problem.

Fig. 5 also explains the observation made in the second
part of Section II that the quantum variational criterion
may prove useful for all quantum algorithms, including
those that explicitly evaluate the correlation function for
times longer than β~/2. The frequencies of the main re-
crossing events are given by the non-zero maxima of the
ﬂux-ﬂux spectral density. By diminishing the weight of
the high frequency part of the ﬂux-ﬂux spectral density,
the amplitude of the re-crossing ﬂux is also diminished.
Therefore, we expect that the value of the pF (a) ratio
deﬁned by Eq. (10), and which is a direct measure of

7

the extent of re-crossings, is also diminished, for most
surfaces.

IV. THE CLASSICAL LIMIT OF CF (0).

In this section, we demonstrate that,

in the classi-
cal limit, Wigner’s variational principle and the quan-
tum variational criterion based on the minimization of
CF (0) produce the same optimal surfaces. We interpret
the agreement between the two variational approaches
as additional evidence in favor of the quantum varia-
tional criterion. After all, the computational usefulness
of Wigner’s variational principle has been well estab-
lished in practice in countless numerical applications.

For deﬁniteness, we again assume that the physical
coordinates have been rescaled such that all masses are
equal to the common value m0. The value at the origin
of the ﬂux autocorrelation function reads

where the dependence with ~ of CF (0) and Qr(T ) is im-
plicitly understood.

Eq. (30) proves our claim that both the quantum vari-
ational criterion based on the minimization of CF (0) and
Wigner’s variational principle lead to the same dividing
surface in the classical limit. As observed in Section III
for a similar situation, if there are degeneracies of the
optimal dividing surface at the level of the Wigner’s vari-
ational principle, then these degeneracies might be lifted
at the level of the quantum theory. One just needs to
take into account the correction terms of order ~0Qr(T ),
~1Qr(T ), etc., in Eq. (30) until the degeneracies are com-
pletely lifted or until the list of correction terms is ex-
hausted. However, such an analysis is of little interest
and will not be considered. As apparent from Eq. (30),
the dominant term in the expression of CF (0)/Qr(T ) is
of order ~−1 and diverges in the limit ~
0. This ﬁnd-
ing is in agreement with the well-known properties of the
classical ﬂux-ﬂux correlation functions of behaving like
2kcl,T ST (T )Qr(T )δ(t) near the origin and, thus, being
inﬁnite at t = 0.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The reader should understand that we have not at-
tempted to develop a quantum transition state theory.
Rather, our purpose has been to ﬁnd the dividing sur-
face that makes best use of short-time information, with
the understanding that suitable approximations or exact
rates, but not necessarily upper bounds are sought. On
one hand, we have argued that algorithms based on the

evaluation of long-time dynamics are inherently unfeasi-
ble. On the other hand, we have pointed out that the
short time information is highly redundant and leads to
numerically unstable algorithms. We have then asked the
question of what is the dividing surface that makes best
use of the available short time information, in the sense
of alleviating the numerical instability.

We have concluded that, independent of the nature of
the inversion algorithms, the surface that minimizes the
value of the MST ﬂux-ﬂux correlation function at t = 0 is
nearly optimal and ensures low redundancy in the input
data. To further support the optimality of our dividing
surface, we have demonstrated that the quantum vari-
ational criterion introduced in the present paper trans-
forms into Wigner’s variational principle in the classical
limit. This ﬁnding is relevant, because Wigner’s varia-
tional principle is generally considered as making best
use of short time information, for classical systems.

We have explained that the variational criterion is ex-
pected to be useful for all algorithms, including those
that explicitly evaluate the correlation function for times
longer than β~/2. This has been demonstrated in the sec-
ond part of Section II, for an asymmetric Eckart barrier.
The usefulness claimed above can be understood in the
classical limit via Wigner’s variational principle: surfaces
that minimize the TST rate of reaction are, to a large ex-

9

tent, also surfaces of minimal re-crossings [as measured
by the ratio pF (a) introduced in Section II]. The quantum
argument is as follows: because the quantum variational
criterion decreases the weight of the high frequency part
of the ﬂux-ﬂux spectral density (the non-zero maxima
of which are associated with the main re-crossing fre-
quencies), the amplitude of the re-crossing ﬂux is also
diminished.

The arguments presented in the paper allow us to con-
clude with reasonable certainty that the dividing surface
produced by our criterion [i.e., minimization of CF (0)] is
nearly optimal for any quantum TST-like theory. One
can thus focus future theoretical eﬀort on the develop-
ment of such theories.

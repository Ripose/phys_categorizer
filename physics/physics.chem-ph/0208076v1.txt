Electronic correlation in cyclic polyenes. Behavior of approximate coupled-pair
theories for large rings

We investigate the cyclic polyenes (annulenes) CM HM , described by the Pariser–Parr–Pople
(PPP) model, by means of the approximate coupled-pair theories (ACP, ACPQ). For the systems
with the spectroscopic value of the PPP resonance integral β = 2.5 eV, the ACP method breaks
down for M ≥ 446 and the ACPQ method—for M > 194. In the ACPQ method, for M > 170, two
close lying solutions have been observed that become quasi-degenerate for M ≥ 198. The results
indicate that the ACP and ACPQ methods cannot be applied to the one-dimensional metallic case.

INTRODUCTION

for large annulenes.

The problem of electronic correlation in the π-electron
systems corresponding to small cyclic polyenes (annu-
lenes) has been studied extensively within the Pariser–
Parr-Pople (PPP) model by Paldus et al. [1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. They have found that
the coupled-cluster doubles method (CCD) [in annu-
lenes equivalent to the coupled-cluster singles and dou-
bles (CCSD) one] breaks down when the correlation ef-
fects become suﬃciently strong. They devised the ap-
proximate coupled-pair method corrected for connected
quadruple excited clusters (ACPQ) [1, 2]. The ACPQ
method, together with the similar ACP-D45 method (or
ACP, in short) [13], was shown to perform very well for
the small annulenes, being convergent and giving corre-
lation energies close to the full conﬁguration interaction
(FCI) results.

Recently, small annulenes have been studied with the
inclusion of the doubles (D), triples (T), and quadru-
ples (Q) in the cluster operator [14]. It turned out that
although the inclusion of quadruple excitations consider-
ably improves the results in the weakly and moderately
correlated regime (which correspond to large and mod-
erate absolute values of the PPP resonance integral β,
respectively), the CCDT, CCDQ, and CCDTQ methods
break down in the strongly correlated regime. It was also
found that in the strongly correlated regime the t2 ampli-
tudes of the ACP and ACPQ methods diﬀer considerably
from the FCI t2 amplitudes.

Even though the ACP and ACPQ methods are satis-
factory for small annulenes, it has been unknown how the
methods perform for large annulenes, where the quasi-
degeneracy problems may be too strong. The strength of
the correlation (and the level of quasi-degeneracy) can be
adjusted by decreasing the absolute value of β for small
annulenes, but it has been unknown whether this proce-
dure is equivalent to the increasing of the size of the ring
and keeping the resonance integral constant. The behav-
ior of the methods for large systems is important if one
wants to extrapolate the results and study the limit of
the one-dimensional metal. That motivated us to inves-
tigate the performance of the ACP and ACPQ methods

THEORY

In this Letter, we provide only a brief description of
the PPP model of annulenes; more details may be found
in Ref. 14.

We shall consider annulenes of formula CM HM , where
M = 4m0 + 2, m0 = 1, 2, . . . , and the number of elec-
trons N = M . The C atoms form a regular polygon,
and the C–C bonds are assumed to be of the length
R0 = 1.4 ˚A. The Fock-space Hamiltonian ˆH, built ac-
cording to the prescriptions of the PPP model, is given
in Eq. (2) of Ref. 14. The following semiempirical pa-
rameters are used: the Coulomb integral α = 0, the res-
onance integral β = −2.5 eV (the so-called spectroscopic
value), and the two-center two-electron integrals γmn are
parametrized with the Mataga–Nishimoto formula [15],
γ(R) = e2[R+e2(γ0)−1]−1 , where e is the electron charge
and γ0 = γ(0) = 10.84 eV. Within the PPP computer
code, the atomic units are used: 1 bohr = 0.529177 ˚A,
1 hartree = 27.2116 eV (the conversion factors are the
same as employed in Refs. 16 and 14).

The ACP and ACPQ methods are approximations to
the CCD method.
In this method we use exponential
Ansatz and expand the ground-state wave function Ψ by
using the cluster operator ˆT = ˆT2,

Ψ = exp( ˆT2)Φ,

(1)

where Φ is a single-determinantal reference conﬁguration,
usually the RHF wave function. The ˆT2 operator depends
linearly on some parameters, the so-called t2 amplitudes,
that can be obtained by solving the set of nonlinear CCD
equations given by

∗

hΦ

| exp(− ˆT2) ˆH exp( ˆT2)Φi = 0,

(2)

where Φ∗ represent all the doubly excited conﬁgurations.
The correlation energy for the ground state is completely
determined by the t2 amplitudes and can be calculated
as

Ecorr = hΦ| ˆH ˆT2Φi − EHF.

terms in the ACP method.

The cyclic symmetry of our PPP model imposes some
extra conditions on the CC model. The t1 amplitudes
(singles) must vanish, and therefore Φ is also the Brueck-
ner determinantal function [17, 18]. Thus, the CCD
method becomes equivalent to the CCSD one.
In the
presence of the cyclic symmetry, the amplitudes depend
on 3 indices (instead of 4), and the number of amplitudes
scales as M 3 (instead of M 4). Moreover, the computa-
tional cost for the CCD iteration scales as M 4 instead
of M 6. This makes enormous savings in the CPU time
for large annulenes and makes them computationally ac-
cessible. The ACP and ACPQ methods violate the al-
ternancy symmetry [19], and therefore we have not used
this symmetry in the present calculations. The details of
the implementation of the cyclic symmetry are given in
Ref. 14.

The explicit form of the CCD equations is most con-
veniently presented in the form of diagrams (see, e.g.,
Ref. 20). The left hand side of Eq. (2) is then a sum

method, some of the quadratic terms of the CCD equa-
tions are omitted (these are the diagrams that do not
factorize with respect to the hole lines). It was shown [2]
that these terms are approximately canceled by the terms
corresponding to the connected quadruple excitations.
Thus, the omission of these terms may improve the re-
sults and was shown to be very eﬀective for the annulenes
in the strongly correlated regime [2]. The only quadratic
terms that are present in the ACP method correspond to
the diagrams in Fig. 1 (the labels below are the same as
in Ref. 1, where the complete set of the diagrams may be
found).

For closed-shell calculations, the CC equations may be
put in a spin-adapted form. We use the nonorthogonally
spin-adapted formalism [21], which for the CCD method
and its variants is equivalent to the orthogonally spin-
adapted formalism used by Paldus et al. [2]. With the lat-
ter formalism they devised an improvement to the ACP
method called ACPQ. In this method the diagram (5) of
Fig. 1 is multiplied by 9 in the triplet coupled equations

quadruples and was shown to provide the exact solution
in the limit of β → 0 [2].

The ACPQ method can also be translated to the

RESULTS

We performed the ACP and ACPQ calculations for the
annulenes, CM HM , for M up to 442. In Fig. 2, the ACP
and ACPQ results for small annulenes are compared with
the results of ACPQ+T(ACPQ) [11], FCI results [22],
and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
calculations [23]. These are the methods that were shown
to provide converged results for the small annulenes. It
can be seen that the correlation energy corrected for the
triples in the ACPQ+T(ACPQ) method is much better
than in the ACPQ method. The method depends, how-
ever, on the t2 amplitudes from the ACPQ method, and
will work only if the latter method converges. For small
annulenes the DMRG results are the most accurate and
the deviation from the FCI is so small that it cannot be
seen on the ﬁgure.

Since the ACP and ACPQ correlation energies do not
change much with the increasing size of the ring around
M = 50, it may suggest that the results are close to the
saturation. However, it is not true for the larger annu-
lenes, as shown in Fig. 3. Some numerical values are also
shown in Table I. Surprisingly, the correlation energy is
not monotonic with the increasing size of the ring and
reaches a minimum. It means that the extrapolation of
the results for smaller rings would lead to a completely
wrong result.

We found that the ACP method is convergent up to
M = 442. For M > 270, the use of the direct inversion
in the iterative subspace method (DIIS) [24, 25] was nec-
essary to provide converged results. The DIIS method
was also very useful in accelerating the convergence for
the smaller annulenes.

The results of the ACPQ method are even more com-
plicated. For M < 174 there was one solution found, but
between 174 and 194 we found two solutions. One set of
solutions, later referred to as ACPQ1, is a continuation of
the results for M < 174. It was found by using the ACP
result for a given M as a starting point for the iterative
process with the DIIS method. The other set of solutions,
of lower energy, was found by applying the DIIS iterative
scheme to the MP2 starting point. For M < 174, both
starting points resulted in the same solution (ACPQ1).
None of the ACPQ1 and ACPQ2 converged for M ≥
198. In Fig. 4, the results of the ACPQ method for M
from 150 to 198 are shown. It can be seen that the corre-
lation energies of the two solutions approach each other
and the states become quasi-degenerate for M → 198.
It is interesting to check whether the amplitudes of the

states also approach each other. To test the similarity of
the t2 amplitudes of the two solutions, we calculated the
parameters θ and η deﬁned in Eq. (22) of Ref. 14. Here θ
measures the angle between the vectors formed of the t2
amplitudes, and η—the ratio of the vector lengths. For
M = 174, we found θ = 2.69◦ and η = 0.9989, while for
M = 194, θ = 0.74◦ and η = 0.9999. This shows that the
t2 amplitudes of the ACPQ1 and the ACPQ2 solutions
are quite similar for M = 174, and are almost identical
for M = 194.

The existence of multiple solutions of the CC equations
has been observed previously for the H4 model [26, 27],
and the complete set of solutions has been obtained with
the homotopy method [28]. In those studies, one of the
solutions was easily identiﬁed as the ground-state solu-
tion. In contrast, for the ACPQ method of our annulene,
such identiﬁcation is ambiguous. The ACPQ1 solution,
which exists for small annulenes, and which may be con-
sidered as the standard solution, has the energy higher
than the ACPQ2 solution. Some exotic solutions that
have the energy lower than the ground state have been
observed for the PPP model of benzene [29]. Our prelim-
inary results for C10H10 also show the existence of such
solutions [30].

CONCLUSIONS

The ACP an ACPQ methods, while performing satis-
factorily for small annulenes, have convergence problems
for large annulenes. The ACP and ACPQ correlation en-
ergies are not monotonic with the increasing size of the

ring. It shows that an extreme caution must be taken if
one tries to extrapolate the results of the small annulenes
to the inﬁnite limit. In the case of the ACPQ method,
two solutions are found for 174 ≤ M ≤ 194, behaving as
if they coalesce into a single solution between M = 194
and M = 198. However, no converged real solution of
the ACPQ equations has been found beyond M = 194,
which may indicate that the solutions become complex
for M ≥ 198. The above observations indicate that the
ACP and ACPQ methods cannot be applied to the one-
dimensional metallic case.

Among all the methods used in the calculations of
the PPP annulenes, the DMRG method seems the most
promising. However, it should be noted that the method
was not tested in a broader range of the resonance in-
tegral β, especially in the strongly correlated regime of
β ≈ 0, where the various CC methods break down. It is
also unclear whether the method can be applied to the
large or inﬁnite annulenes, since the method may not be
size-extensive for the metallic case [31].

is still an open problem.

The existence of a method that can describe the large
annulenes and the one-dimensional metal in the PPP
model
It is unlikely that
the method that cannot describe the strongly correlated
regime of a small annulene would be able to describe the
inﬁnite case. It seems, however, that the proper behav-
ior of a method in the strongly correlated regime of small
annulenes still does not guarantee the correct description
of the larger systems.

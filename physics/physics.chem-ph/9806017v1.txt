ABSTRACT

We have performed multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations of C-peptide of ribonucle-
ase A. It is known by CD and NMR experiments that this peptide has high α-helix content
in aqueous solution and that the side-chain charges of residues Glu-2− and His-12+ play
an important role in the stability of the α-helix. In order to conﬁrm these experimental
implications, we have used two analogues of the peptide with charged and neutral side
chains of Glu-2 and His-12. Two dielectric functions, distance-dependent and constant, are
considered to study the eﬀects of solvent contributions. All the simulations were started
from random initial conformations. Various thermodynamic quantities such as average
helicity as a function of residue number and average distance between two side chains as
a function of temperature are calculated. The results are found to be in accord with the
implications of CD and NMR experiments. The lowest-energy conformation obtained has
an α-helix from Ala-4 to Gln-11 in complete agreement with the corresponding structure
deduced from an X-ray crystallography experiment of ribonuclease A. It is shown that
the salt bridge between the side chains of Glu-2− and Arg-10+, which is known to exist
from both NMR and X-ray experiments, is formed only when the side chains are prop-
erly charged. Its formation is greatly enhanced when the distance-dependent dielectric
function is used.

The C-peptide, residues 1–13 of ribonuclease A, is known by CD and NMR experiments

to have signiﬁcant α-helix formation in aqueous solution at temperature near 0 ◦C [1,

2].

In this article, we employ a multicanonical Monte Carlo simulation [3] to study

the α-helix stability of C-peptide due to the side-chain electrostatic interactions. The

results are found to be in accord with various implications of the above experiments.

The lowest-energy conformation obtained by the simulation has an α-helix from Ala-4

to Gln-11 in complete agreement with the corresponding structure deduced from an X-

ray crystallographic experiment of the whole ribonuclease A [4].

It is shown that the

characteristic salt bridge between Glu-2− and Arg-10+, which is known to exist both

in the NMR experiment [2] and in the X-ray experiment [4], is formed with signiﬁcant

probability only when the side chains are properly charged and some solvation eﬀects are

included.

The CD experiment of C-peptide showed that the side-chain charges of residues Glu-

2− and His-12+ play an important role in the stability of the α-helix, while the rest of

the charges of other side chains do not [1]. A previous simulation work [5] by Monte

Carlo simulated annealing [6] conﬁrmed the α-helix formation and the importance of the

electrostatic interactions of the above two side chains for the stability of the helix. The

simulation was performed in gas phase, however, and it failed in obtaining the character-

istic salt bridge between Glu-2− and Arg-10+.

In this work, we used two analogues of C-peptide in order to study the importance for

α-helix stability due to the electrostatic interactions of the side-chain charges of residues

Glu-2 and His-12. The amino-acid sequences of these analogues are K+E−TAAAK+FER+QH+M

and K+ETAAAK+FE−R+QHM. We refer to the former as Peptide I and the latter Pep-

tide II hereafter. The main diﬀerence between the two peptides is the charges of residues

Glu-2 and His-12 (both are charged for Peptide I and neutral for Peptide II, respectively).

The potential energy function that we used is given by the sum of the electrostatic term,

12-6 Lennard-Jones term, and hydrogen-bond term for all pairs of atoms in the peptide

together with the torsion term for all torsion angles. The energy parameters were adopted

from ECEPP/2 [7]. A distance-dependent dielectric function [8] was used to mimic the

presence of water. A constant dielectric function (ǫ = 2) was also used for a comparison

2

with gas-phase simulations. The computer code KONF90 [5] was used.

The Monte Carlo method that we used is multicanonical algorithm [3], which belongs

to a class of generalized-ensemble algorithms (for a discussion and comparison of these

algorithms, see, for instance, Ref. [9]). This method was introduced to the protein folding

problem a few years ago [10], and the eﬀectiveness of the method has been established

for oligopeptide systems [11, 12]. The method allows one to sample a wide range of

conﬁguration space and overcome the multiple-minima problem that is responsible for

the very long equilibrization time required by conventional methods. ¿From a single

simulation run, it thus enables one to obtain not only the lowest-energy conformation

but also any thermodynamic quantity over a wide range of temperatures [3, 10]. In the

present work, we performed four multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations of 1,000,000

Monte Carlo sweeps each, where one Monte Carlo sweep updates all the torsion angles in

the peptide once. The four runs are: one with distance-dependent dielectric function for

Peptide I, one with constant dielectric function for Peptide I, and two corresponding runs

for Peptide II. The simulations were started from completely random initial conformations.

We ﬁrst examine how much α-helix formation we obtain by the simulations. We found

that on the average 65.2 (1.0) % of the residues are in α-helix state at temperature T = 273

K for Peptide I with distance-dependent dielectric function, while the value was 52.3 (3.5)

% for Peptide II with the same dielectric function (the numbers in parentheses are errors).

Here, a residue is deﬁned to be in α-helix state if the backbone dihedral angles (φ, ψ) fall

in the range (−70 ± 30◦, −37 ± 30◦). The average length of α-helix at this temperature

are, likewise, 7.7 (2.2) residues long and 4.8 (0.5) residues long for Peptide I and Peptide

II, respectively. Furthermore, at this temperature the average energy diﬀerences between
helical conformations and non-helical conformations, ∆E (≡< EH > − < EC >), are
−20.5 (3.5) and −3.1 (4.7) for Peptide I and Peptide II, respectively. Here, < EH >

and < EC > stand for the average total potential energies of helical conformations and

non-helical conformations, respectively (and a helical conformation is deﬁned to be a

conformation that has at least 3 successive residues in the α-helix state). The large

diﬀerence in ∆E implies that a helical conformation is energetically favored. All these

results support the experimental fact that the side-chain charges of the residues Glu-2

3

and His-12 enhance the α-helix stability of C-peptide [1].

In Figure 1 we compare the average % helicity of the two peptides at T = 273 K as a

function of residue number obtained by simulations with the distance-dependent dielectric

function. The overall helicity is larger in Peptide I than in Peptide II as just discussed

above. The helicity is very high from residue 4 to residue 11 and it is very low from

residue 1 to residue 3 (and residues 12 and 13) for Peptide I. This is in accord with the

implications of the NMR experiment of C-peptide, where they found lowered population

of helices for residues 1–3 and high helix content for residues 5–12 [2]. The results for

Peptide II, on the other hand, is inconsistent with the NMR data in that they predict

high helicity for residue 2 and very low helicity for residue 7. These ﬁndings again support

the fact that the charges of the residues Glu-2 and His-12 are important for the α-helix

stability of C-peptide.

The lowest-energy conformations of the two peptides obtained by the simulations

with the distance-dependent dielectric function are now compared.

In Table I we give

the backbone dihedral angles of these conformations together with those of a structure

deduced by the X-ray experiment [4]. The conformation of Peptide I has an α-helix in

residues 4–11 in complete agreement with the X-ray data, while that of Peptide II has

an extended α-helix only for residues 8–12. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations of

these conformations from the X-ray structure are also presented in the Table. One ﬁnds

that the backbone structure for Peptide I is very similar to that of the X-ray data (r.m.s.

distance of 1.4 ˚A).

The lowest-energy conformation of Peptide I is shown in Figure 2A. ¿From the Figure

we see that the characteristic salt bridge between Glu 2− and Arg 10+, which exists both

in the NMR data [2] and in the X-ray data [4], is indeed formed.

In Figure 2B this

structure and the X-ray structure are displayed together in a superposition. One can see

that the two tertiary structures are quite similar to each other (r.m.s. distance is 2.7

˚A from Table I).

The formation of the salt bridge can be studied by calculating the average distance

between the side chains of Glu-2 and Arg-10 as a function of temperature. Here, the

distance between these side chains is deﬁned to be the smallest of the distance between

4

Oǫ of Glu-2 and Hη of Arg-10. The results for all four runs are given in Figure 3. From the

Figure one ﬁnds that the results for Peptide I with distance-dependent dielectric function

give the shortest average distance between the two side chains at low temperatures. This

implies that the salt bridge between Glu-2 and Arg-10 is favored most when the side

chains of residues Glu-2 and His-12 are charged (Peptide I rather than Peptide II) and

some solvation eﬀects are included (distance-dependent dielectric function rather than

constant one).

In this article, we have presented the results of multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations

applied to the tertiary-structure prediction of C-peptide of ribonuclease A. The results

were in good agreement with various implications of CD, NMR, and X-ray experiments. It

should be emphasized that the simulations were performed from completely random initial

conformations and that no structural information from experiments was used as input.

Furthermore, it is a great advantage of multicanonical algorithm over other methods that

one needs only a single simulation run to obtain any thermodynamic quantity for a wide

range of temperatures.

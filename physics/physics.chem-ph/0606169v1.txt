Abstract

This paper investigates the impact of control ﬁeld noise on the optimal manipulation of quantum

dynamics. Simulations are performed on several multilevel quantum systems with the goal of

population transfer in the presence of signiﬁcant control noise. The noise enters as run-to-run

variations in the control amplitude and phase with the observation being an ensemble average over

many runs as is commonly done in the laboratory. A genetic algorithm with an improved elitism

operator is used to ﬁnd the optimal ﬁeld that either ﬁghts against or cooperates with control ﬁeld

noise. When seeking a high control yield it is possible to ﬁnd ﬁelds that successfully ﬁght with the

noise while attaining good quality stable results. When seeking modest control yields, ﬁelds can

be found which are optimally shaped to cooperate with the noise and thereby drive the dynamics

more eﬃciently. In general, noise reduces the coherence of the dynamics, but the results indicate

that population transfer objectives can be met by appropriately either ﬁghting or cooperating with

noise, even when it is intense.

INTRODUCTION

Control of quantum processes is actively being pursued theoretically [1, 2] and

experimentally[3, 4]. In practice control ﬁeld noise and environmental interactions inevitably

will be present, and the general expectation is that their involvement will be deleterious to-

wards achieving control[5]. The present paper only considers the inﬂuence of ﬁeld noise

upon the controlled dynamics with the noise described by shot-to-shot pulse variations, as

in the signal average experiments. A separate work will explore analogous issue for environ-

mental interactions. Recent studies have considered several aspects of the inﬂuence of laser

noise[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], and this work aims to further explore the issue. Operating under

closed loop[12] in the laboratory will naturally deal with the noise as best as possible. Using

simple models and simulations, this paper will explore the nature of robustness to noise

and the possibility of cooperating with the noise rather than ﬁghting against it, especially

in the strong noise limit. Such a prospect has foundation in analogous classical stochastic

resonance phenomena[13].

The presence of ﬁeld noise in quantum control

is generally viewed as problematic,

but recent successful experiments at least support the point that some noise can be

tolerated[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and that it may have a constructive eﬀect in quantum

dynamics[20, 21, 22, 23]. A recent theoretical analysis[7] on the impact of ﬁeld noise upon

optimal control indicated that an inherent degree of robustness can be anticipated by virtue

of controlled observable expectation values being bilinear in the evolution operator and its

adjoint. Some simulations of closed loop experiments also show that robust control is pos-

sible, and that properly designed control ﬁelds can ﬁght against noise[6, 24, 25]. In some

special circumstances, ﬁeld noise even may be helpful[26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. The pres-

ence of ﬁeld noise may also improve the convergence rate of the laboratory learning control

processes[24, 25].

In this paper, we will investigate four model illustrations of optimal control in the presence

of ﬁeld noise, especially for cases of strong noise. It is naturally found that ﬁeld noise is

deleterious to achieving control if a high yield is desired, however we also ﬁnd robust high

yield solutions that are extremely stable with respect to noise. If a low yield is acceptable,

then it is shown that ﬁeld noise may even be helpful and the control ﬁeld can cooperate

with it. The present work primarily aims to demonstrate these ﬁndings in several model

2

illustrations. A follow on paper will analyze the mathematical and physical origin of the

observed behavior[32].

Section II will present the model and control formulation used in these studies. Section

III describes the genetic algorithm employed to search for an optimal control ﬁeld in the

presence of noise, and some special algorithmic modiﬁcations are made for this purpose.

Section IV presents a set of control simulations under various system and noise conditions.

Some brief concluding remarks are given in section V.

II. THE MODEL SYSTEM

The eﬀect of ﬁeld noise on controlled quantum dynamics will be explored in the context

of population transfer in multilevel systems characterized by the Hamiltonian H,

where |υi is an eigenstate of H0 and ευ is the associated ﬁeld-free eigen-energy. The noise-free

control ﬁeld E(t) is taken to have the form

H = H0 − uE(t)

with the cost function:

In each simulation, a reference noise-free optimal control calculation is ﬁrst performed

where OT is the target value (expressed as a percent yield in the applications later) and

O [E0(t)] is the outcome produced by the ﬁeld E0(t), and F0 is the ﬂuence of the control ﬁeld

whose contribution is weighted by the constant, α > 0. In the present work, O = |Ψf i hΨf |

is a projection operator for the population of the target state |Ψf i.

Noise in the laboratory could take on various forms and arise from a number of sources[9].

In keeping with laboratory practice, the achieved control will be measured as an ensemble

average over the outcome of many control ﬁelds. Here the noise is modeled as run-to-run

uncertainties in the amplitudes and phases in Eq.(2a)[6]. This work will take an extreme

conservative view to explore the nature of achievable control when such noise is large and

independent of each other in the diﬀerent runs. The noise is simulated by introducing the

parameters γAl and γθl which are chosen randomly over the range [−ΓA, ΓA] and [−Γθ, Γθ],

respectively,

A(i)

l = A0

What is referred to as ”amplitude noise” alone actually allows for phase changes over the

range [−ΓA, ΓA]. By exploring the case of Γθ 6= 0, ΓA = 0, the phase contribution will

become clear. Diﬀerent random values are selected for the amplitudes and phases over their

respective ranges in replicate simulations i = 1, 2, · · · , M corresponding to an ensemble of

M control experiments. The i-th experiment is driven by ﬁeld

III. A GENETIC ALGORITHM WITH AN IMPROVED ELITISM OPERATOR

IN THE PRESENCE OF CONTROL NOISE

Current quantum control experiments[12] employ genetic (GA)[33] or evolutionary

algorithms[14] to identify optimal control ﬁelds. Simulations have shown [24, 25] that GAs

can tolerate a high level of noise because they don’t make sharp decisions, allowing for de-

cision errors to be averaged out over the generations of the learning process. GAs can be

very eﬀective, but they also can be expensive to employ, especially when optimizing a shot-

to-shot stochastic process because a large number of experiments are needed to perform the

ensemble average. Many of the simulations in this work include signiﬁcant ﬁeld noise, and

it was found that at least M = 104 runs are needed to get accurate ensemble averages. In

order to speed up the simulations, many strategies have been proposed[34, 35, 36]. Here we

used a simple approach: only perform full statistical averaging with the most eﬀective ﬁeld

at each generation, while for intermediate assessments of all other individuals use a small

number of ensemble average runs. The detailed procedure to select an optimal ﬁeld consists

of the following steps:

1.

Initialize the GA. We assume there are two special individuals, one is denoted as

”best”, which is the best member of population; another is denoted as ”elitist”, which will

be updated in each generation. elitist is the same as best when the GA starts.

2. Perform the standard operations of reproduction, crossover and mutation to generate

a new population for the next generation. Evaluate the ﬁtness of each individual in the

population with a small size ensemble (M ≤ 103 in this work).

3. Compare the objective values arising from elitist and best (the best member of the

new generation):

(M ≥ 104 in this work);

if J(elitist) ≤ J(best) then re-evaluate the cost function of elitist with a large ensemble

5

if J(elitist) > J(best) then re-evaluate the cost function of best with a large ensemble

(M ≥ 104 in this work);

4. Compare the updated cost function value of elitist and best from the last step;

if J(elitist) ≤ J(best) then replace the worst member of population with elitist

if J(elitist) > J(best) then set elitist = best;

5. Go to step 2, and repeat the GA operations until convergence is fulﬁlled.

Although there is always a chance that a good ﬁeld is overlooked by this procedure, it

proved to be eﬀective in ﬁnding robust ﬁelds. The procedure is very eﬃcient as it only

performs extensive statistical averaging on the likely most eﬀective ﬁelds.

IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

To demonstrate how quantum optimal control can either ﬁght or cooperate with ﬁeld

noise, we performed four simulations with simple model systems. The ﬁrst three simulations

use the single path system in Figure 1(a) while the last simulation uses the double-path

system in Figure 1(b). Equation (8) is the cost function used to the guide GA choice of

the control ﬁeld. The average yields shown in all the tables typically involve an ensemble

of M = 104 samples. The simulations used the Toolkit technique[37] to eﬃciently solve the

Schr¨odinger equation.

A. Model 1

This model used the single path 5-level system in Figure 1(a) with eigenstates |ii, i =

0, · · · , 4 of the ﬁeld free Hamiltonian H0, having only nearest neighbor transitions with the
frequencies ω01 = 1.511, ω12 = 1.181, ω23 = 0.761, ω34 = 0.553 in rad·fs−1, and associated

transition dipole moments µ01 = 0.5855, µ12 = 0.7079, µ23 = 0.8352, µ34 = 0.9281 in
1.0 × 10−30 C·m. The target time is T = 200 fs, and the pulse width in Eq.(5) is s = 30 fs.

The control objective is to transfer the population from the initially prepared ground state

|0i to the ﬁnal state |4i, such that O = |4i h4|. As a reference control case, the algorithm

is run ﬁrst without any ﬁeld noise using the cost function in Eq.(3a). Figure 2 shows the

optimal ﬁeld for the two separate goals OT = 100% and 2.25%. These two extreme cases of

high and low target yield are chosen to illustrate their distinct control behavior in the present

6

of noise. The choice of the low yield target of 2.25% is arbitrary with similar behavior found

for yields up to ∼ 10%. In some applications even making a modest yield of a particular

product or state for study would be signiﬁcant. The physical criteria in the low yield limit

is that suﬃcient noise be present to produce at least a small population in the target state.

At the target time, the noise free ﬁelds in Figures 2(a1) and 2(b1) drive 98.7% and 2.2% of

the population to target state, respectively.

In order to calibrate the strength of the noise, Table I shows the state population distri-

butions when the system is only driven by noise of various amplitudes. When ΓA > 0.07,

the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld noise is very large as it drives more than 40% population out of the

ground state. To examine the inﬂuence of noise when seeking an optimal control ﬁeld, ﬁrst

consider the case of aiming for a high yield (i.e., perfect control with the target yield set at

OT = 100% in Eq.(7)). Table II shows how the optimal control ﬁelds ﬁght with diﬀerent

types of noise in this case. In order to reveal the separate contributions of noise upon the
optimally controlled dynamics, Table II shows the yield from noise alone DO hE(i)
n (t)iEN
without the control ﬁeld being present. Here E(i)
n (t) is the i-th member of a pure ﬁeld noise

The control ﬁeld is determined optimally in the presence of noise; as a reference, the yield

O [E0(t)] of each optimal ﬁeld without noise is presented. The second and third rows of Table

II show that the optimal control can ﬁght against amplitude noise by increasing the ﬂuence

F0, although the eﬀect of noise is always deleterious. The variance σN naturally increases as

the amplitude ΓA rises. The last three rows of Table II reveal that optimal control ﬁelds can

be found that are fully robust to strong phase noise with small yield variance. This result

may appear to be surprising, as proper adjustment of control ﬁeld phase is often viewed as

necessary for attaining a good quality control yield[32]. Table III further examines this issue

where it is found that robustness at any level of noise assures robustness at other levels.

However, this result alone does not reveal the degree of average coherence maintained in the

dynamics. The shot-to-shot signal averaged density matrix of the quantum system can be

deﬁned as:

Figure 3 plots these measures of the density matrix and the state populations of the system

driven by the ﬁeld in the last row of Table II with strong phase noise Γθ = π. Figure

3(a1) shows that the high level of phase noise totally destroys the coherence of the system

(Rc(t) ≃ 0) while Figure 3(b1) shows that large coherence is built up by the same control if no

noise is present. The state populations are also shown in Figures 3(a2) and 3(b2) indicating

in both cases that the target goal is reached via a simple four-step ladder climbing pathway

which is evidently not sensitive to phase. The result in Figure 3 needs to be understood

in the context that ρ(i)(t), for the arbitrary i − th member of the ensemble, will generally

have a signiﬁcant degree of coherence along its evolution. The details of the shot-to-shot

coherence changes rather randomly such that Rc(t) ≃ 0, but the noise average hTrρ2i could

contain a coherent contribution. Further insight into this situation will be analyzed upon

examination of model 2 in Section 4.2.

If we accept a low control yield outcome, very diﬀerent control behavior is found in the

presence of noise. The results from optimizing Eq.(8) are shown in Table IV with various

levels of amplitude and phase noise. In all cases the target yield is OT = 2.25%. Table IV

shows that low ﬁeld amplitude noise (ΓA ≤ 0.01) has little impact on the control outcome.

Additional amplitude noise becomes more helpful indicated by the reduced control ﬁeld

ﬂuence. In the domain 0.06 ≤ ΓA ≤ 0.08, the control outcome is much larger than the sum

of the yield from the control ﬁeld and noise alone. For example at ΓA = 0.07 the noise and

8

optimal ﬁeld alone, respectively, produce yields of 0.26% and 0.16%. But, the same ﬁeld

operating in the presence of the noise produces a yield 2.11%. This behavior indicates that

the ﬁeld is cooperating with the presence of noise to more eﬀectively achieve the posed goal.
The left and right variance, σ−

N , respectively, indicate a very asymmetric distribution

N and σ+

having a long tail on the high population side. Again, we also ﬁnd several solutions that are

very stable to phase noise. The collective results for amplitude noise are plotted in Figure

4.

Figure 5 shows the evolution of the density matrix measures Rc, Rd and R in Eq.(12) at

diﬀerent ﬁeld noise amplitude ΓA levels. With strong noise there is little surviving coherence

indicated by Rc, except in the time around t∼ 100 fs. In order to further explore the robust

nature of the controlled dynamics in this low yield regime, Table V presents the outcome

of applying noise at the amplitude Γ′
ΓA. The yield for Eop

ΓA with Γ′

A to a ﬁeld optimally determined at noise amplitude

A = ΓA is the outcome for the ﬁeld optimally determined with

the noise at ΓA. It is evident that once a ﬁeld cooperates with noise at level ΓA, then it

cooperates with noise at any other level. We may conclude that at low yield, cooperation

can be arranged, but at the expense of coherence.

B. Model 2

Model 2 extends the Hamiltonian of model 1 in Figure 1(a) to allow for two quanta

transitions: ω02 = 2.692, ω13 = 1.942, ω24 = 1.314 in rad·fs−1, with transition dipole
elements: µ02 = −0.1079, µ13 = −0.1823, µ24 = −0.2786, in 1.0 × 10−30 C·m. Table VI

shows that for a high target yield of OT = 100%, the control ﬁeld can again eﬀectively ﬁght

against amplitude noise by increasing the ﬂuence F0. But, as with the results in Table II,

increasing the amplitude of the noise makes this battle harder with the ﬁnal average yield

decreasing and the variance increasing. The case of pure phase noise at Γθ = 1.0 shows

sensitivity to its presence with the yield falling to 68%. The last row of Table VI also shows

a solution that is extremely robust to phase noise with reduced variance at a surprisingly

small ﬂuence(i.e., the ﬂuence is even smaller than for the case ΓA = 0.0.) This latter behavior

is likely the result of there being many solutions to the optimal control search process with

the algorithm ﬁnding alternative solutions under diﬀerent circumstances.

Table VII further analyzes the robustness of the last two phase noise contaminated ﬁelds

9

in Table VI. When the ﬁeld Eop

0.0 (i.e., determined with no noise) is applied with a high

level of phase noise, at Γθ = 2.0, there is poor robustness with the ﬁnal yield dropping to

24.2%. However, for the yield optimally determined at the high noise level Γ′

θ = 2.0, there is

robustness to lower levels of noise. The power spectra for the ﬁeld optimized at Γθ = 0.0 and
2.0 are shown in Figure 6. Comparing the two plots we see that Eop
along a path of single quantum transitions while Eop

0.0(t) drives the system as well with the

2.0(t) drives the system

additional two quanta transition 2 → 4. The presence of the extra two quantum transition

can set up a delicate situation which is sensitive to phase noise, as Table VII indicates. The

robustness of the single quantum path for Γθ = 2.0 is analogous to what was found in model

Two tables similar as Table IV and V but for model 2 can be constructed to show strong

cooperation between optimal control ﬁeld and noise when target yield is low (OT = 3.65%),

and the data can be plotted to form a ﬁgure analogous to that of Figure 4.

1.

C. Model 3

This model is same as model 1, but amplitude noise is only present in the 0 ↔ 1 transition.

Thus, noise alone cannot drive any population into the target state. There is also no phase

noise in any of the transitions. Table VIII shows the results from diﬀerent levels of 0 ↔ 1

amplitude noise for a low yield target of OT = 10%. There is little evidence of cooperation

with the noise, except in the last row with ΓA = 0.2. In this case, the ﬁeld ﬂuence is low and

the yield from the ﬁeld alone is almost zero. But, the desired target is achieved when the

ﬁeld cooperates with the noise. Figure 7 shows the power spectrum of the optimal ﬁeld for

this case and it is evident that the 0 ↔ 1 transition is absent. The mechanism of cooperation

is clear: noise drives the system from level 0 to level 1, then the control ﬁeld drives it to

level 4. The remaining cases in Table VIII do not exclude the possibility that ﬁelds could

be found that also cooperate with other levels of noise. The result at ΓA = 0.20 shows that

such noise cooperative solutions exist.

10

D. Model 4

The fourth model is the more complex two-path system in Figure 1(b). In this model,

population can be transferred to the target state |4i along two separate pathways. The

transition frequencies and dipoles of the left path are same as that of model 1; the right

path has the distinct transition frequencies: ω0′1′ = 2.153, ω1′2′ = 1.346, ω2′3′ = 0.345,
ω3′4′ = 0.162 in rad·fs−1 and dipole elements: µ0′1′ = 0.6526, µ1′2′ = 0.7848, µ2′3′ = 0.9023,
µ3′4′ = 1.0322 in 1.0 × 10−30 C·m. For simplicity, along both paths only single quanta

transitions are allowed.

The results in Table IX show cooperation between the ﬁeld and the noise in model 4 for

a low target yield of OT = 2.25%. Figure 8 shows the power spectra of the three optimal

ﬁelds in Table IX. Panel (a) indicates that in the case of no noise the ﬁeld primarily drives

system along the right path. When noise is present in the left path (panel (b)), the optimal

ﬁeld drives the system along the left path in order to cooperate with the noise. Similarly,

when the noise is in the right path (panel (c)), the optimal ﬁeld drives the system along

the right path. An interesting feature of case (c) is the lack of intensity for the last step

|3′i → |4′i along the path. Evidently the optimal ﬁeld fully draws on the noise for this step

as a special case of cooperation. The presence of the ﬂuence term in the cost function favors

such behavior provided that the target goal can be met.

These results clearly show that eﬃciently achieving the yield is the guiding principal

dictating the nature of the control ﬁeld and mechanism in this case. This behavior reﬂects

the nature of the cost function in Eq.(7), which places no demand on the coherence of the

dynamics, but only asks that the control be eﬃciently achieved with α > 0. If coherence

maintenance was also included in the cost function the ﬁeld would be guided accordingly, in

keeping with the ability to meet the newly posed objective.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The impact of amplitude and phase noise upon quantum control is explored in this

paper with particular emphasis on these being strong. Numerical simulations from several

cases suggest that control ﬁelds can be found that either cooperate with or ﬁght against

noise, depending on the circumstances. In the case of low target yields, the control ﬁeld

11

can eﬀectively cooperate with amplitude noise to drive the dynamics while minimizing the

control ﬂuence. In this regime pure phase noise has little impact, if the pathway to the target

involved single quanta transitions. But, phase noise was found to be disruptive if there are

multiple interfering pathways. Optimal solutions were also found that exhibited stability

with respect to phase noise while maintaining high yields.

In general, when successfully

either ﬁghting or cooperating with signiﬁcant noise, the expense paid is a measured loss of

dynamical coherence. In some applications a lack of full coherence can be tolerated.

The interaction between the noise and ﬁeld driven dynamics is generally a highly non-

linear process. The noise can be constructive[23] or destructive[9] in the manipulation of

quantum dynamics, improve[24, 25] or reduce[38] the convergence rate of searching pro-

cesses, and this disparate behavior makes it diﬃcult to precisely identify the impact of noise

under various circumstances. This work explored several special cases to reveal what may

happen when searching for optimal controls in the presence of ﬁeld noise; a mathematical

analysis of the observed behavior may also be carried out[32]. The ability to ﬁnd robust,

and even cooperative solutions, is most encouraging. These results are consistent with a

recent analysis [7] arguing that optimally controlled quantum dynamics has a special inher-

ent degree of robustness. Although, each case will likely have its own unique characteristic

behavior, the ﬁndings are encouraging for the ability to manipulate quantum dynamics even

with severe noise being present. It would also be interesting to explore these issues in the

laboratory by selectively introducing measured levels of noise into the control ﬁeld.

FIG. 5: Evolution of the density matrix measures in Eq.(12) with diﬀerent levels of ﬁeld amplitude

noise for the low target yield case of Figure 4. The coherence is successively destroyed by stronger

noise, but it still survives around t∼ 100 fs.

FIG. 6: Power spectra of the control ﬁelds for model 2 aiming at a high yield with OT = 100%.
Plot(a) is for the ﬁeld Eop

2.0 robust to phase noise; plot(b) is for the ﬁeld Eop

0.0 which is not robust

to noise. The robust control ﬁeld in (a) avoids the extra interference arising from the two quanta

transition 2 ↔ 4.

FIG. 7: The optimal ﬁeld power spectra of model 3. Here noise is only in the amplitude of the

0 ↔ 1 transition with ΓA = 0.20. The optimal ﬁeld cooperates with the noise by eliminating the

ω01 frequency and exclusively relying on the noise to drive that step. The arrow indicates where

that frequency lies.

FIG. 8: Power spectra of the control ﬁelds for model 4 (see panel (b) of Figure 1). The frequencies

along the right path in Figure 1 are denoted with a prime to distinguish them from the left path.

(a) No noise, (b) noise in the left path, (c) noise in the right path. In these low target yield cases

the optimal ﬁeld cooperates with the noise and follows the associated path.

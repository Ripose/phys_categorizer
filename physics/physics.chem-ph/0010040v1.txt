Hydration of Methanol in Water

A DFT-based Molecular Dynamics Study

We studied the hydration of a single methanol molecule
in aqueous solution by ﬁrst-principle DFT-based molecular
dynamics simulation. The calculations show that the local
structural and short-time dynamical properties of the wa-
ter molecules remain almost unchanged by the presence of
the methanol, conﬁrming the observation from recent exper-
imental structural data for dilute solutions. We also see, in
accordance with this experimental work, a distinct shell of
water molecules that consists of about 15 molecules. We
found no evidence for a strong tangential ordering of the water
molecules in the ﬁrst hydration shell.

INTRODUCTION

The solvation of alcohols in water has been studied
extensively. [1] It is of fundamental interest in physics,
chemistry and biology, but also of importance in technical
applications. The characteristic hydroxyl group allows
alcohols to form hydrogen bonds and is responsible for
the good solubility of the smaller alcohols. In contrast,
the alkyl group is hydrophobic and does not participate
in the hydrogen bonding network of water. The presence
of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups make the
microscopic picture of solvation of alcohol in water a non-
trivial and therefore interesting matter.

Understanding the solvation of methanol in water is
a prerequisite for the study of chemistry of alcohols in
aqueous solution. Important examples of such reactions
are the conversion of ethanol into acetaldehyde in biolog-
ical systems or the industrial ethanol production by acid-
catalysed hydration of ethylene. An accurate microscopic
understanding of the mechanism and kinetics of such re-
actions is of fundamental interest. However, presently,
this picture is still far from complete. Density Functional
Theory (DFT) based Molecular Dynamics simulation has
proved to be a promising tool provide such an insight. An
accurate calculation of the chemical bonding is incorpo-
rated via a DFT-based electronic structure calculations.
The eﬀect of temperature and solvent on the reactive
events is implicitly accounted for via the Molecular Dy-
namics technique. The implementation of DFT-based
MD as proposed by Car and Parrinello [2] has proven to
be extremely eﬃcient. It has successfully been applied
to study of a large variety of condensed-phase systems
at ﬁnite temperature. Applications to chemical reactions
include the cat-ionic polymerization of 1,2,5-trioxane [3],
or the acid-catalysed hydration of formaldehyde [4].

As a ﬁrst step towards the study of chemical reac-
tions involving alcohols we present in this paper a Car-
Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD) study of the hy-
dration of the simplest alcohol (methanol) in aqueous

solution. Recent experimental work [5] has provided de-
tailed structural information on the solvation shell. Var-
ious molecular simulation studies (e.g. Ref. [6–10] have
addressed structure and dynamics of both the solute and
the solvent. This experimental and numerical work has
revealed that there is a distinct solvation shell around
the methanol, and that the water structure is little af-
fected by the presence of a methanol molecule. In this
paper we will address these structural properties and in
addition consider the dynamics of the methanol and the
water molecules in the solvation shell.

This paper is organized as follows. First we outline
the computational approach and its validation. Then we
present the results for the structure and dynamics of a
single solvated methanol in water. We conclude the paper
with a summary and discussion.

METHODS AND VALIDATION

Electronic structure calculations are performed using
the Kohn-Sham formulation [11] of DFT. [12] We em-
ployed the BLYP functional, that combines a gradient-
corrected term for the correlation energy as proposed by
Lee, Yang and Parr [14] with the gradient correction for
the exchange energy due to Becke [13]. Among the avail-
able functionals, the BLYP functional has proven to give
the best description of the structure and dynamics of wa-
ter. [15,16] All calculations [17] were performed using the
CPMD package. [18]

The pseudopotential method is used to restrict the
number of electronic states to those of the valence elec-
trons. The interaction with the core electrons is taken
into account using semi-local norm-conserving Martins-
Troullier pseudopotentials. [19] The pseudopotential cut-
oﬀ radius for the H was chosen 0.50 au. For O and C
the radii are taken 1.11 and 1.23 a.u.
for both the l=s
and l=p term. The Kohn-Sham states are expanded in a
plane-wave basis set matching the periodicity of the peri-
odic box with waves up to a kinetic energy of 70 Ry. Test
calculations showed that for this structural and energetic
properties were converged within 0.01 ˚A and 1 kJ/mol,
respectively. Frequencies are converged within 1 %, ex-
pect for CO and OH stretch modes that are underesti-
mated by 3 % and 5 % compared to basis-set limit values.
To validate the computational methods outlined above
we performed a series of reference calculations of rel-
evant gas-phase compounds with the CPMD package.
Energetics and geometry were calculated for methanol,
water, two mono-hydrate conﬁgurations, and the di-

1

hydrate conﬁguration shown in Fig. 1. These calcula-
tions were performed using a a large periodic box of
size 10x10x10 ˚A3. The interactions among the periodic
images were eliminated by a screening technique sim-
ilar to that of Ref. [20].
In addition we determined
for the methanol molecule both the harmonic vibra-
tional frequencies and the frequencies at ﬁnite temper-
ature (T= 200 K). The latter includes the anharmonic
contributions, and were obtained from the spectrum of
the velocity auto correlation function (VACF) of a 3 ps
CPMD calculation at E= 200 K. The calculated peak po-
sitions can be compared with experimental spectra. Re-
sults of the gas-phase calculations were compared with
results obtained with a state-of-the-art atomic-orbital
based DFT package (ADF [21]), and with results from
MP2 calculations of Ref. [22]. In the comparison of the
energies zero-point energies were not taken into account.

two water/methanol dimers and a trimer. Distances (˚A) and
angles (degrees) are shown for three computational methods:
CPMD-BLYP (top, present work), ADF-BLYP [21] (middle,
present work) and MP2 [22] (bottom).

Complexation energies and geometries of the methanol
hydrates are given in Tab. I and Fig. 1. Deviations among
CPMD and ADF are within 1 kcal/mole for the energies,
smaller than 0.005 ˚A for the inter-molecular bonds and
within 0.03 ˚A for the weaker intra-molecular bonds. This
indicates a state-of-the art accuracy for electronic struc-
ture methods employed in CPMD. Diﬀerences among
BLYP and MP2 are within acceptable limits, with BLYP
complexation energies smaller by 4 kJ/mole (dimer) and
10 kJ/mole (trimer). These deviations are similar to the
comparison of BLYP and MP2 for the water dimer bind-
ing energy, [15,23] where BLYP is 4 kJ/mole smaller,
with the MP2 energy only 1 kJ/mol below the experi-
mental value. Assuming similar diﬀerences for the com-

2

plexation energies bonds in the methanol hydrates would
suggest that BLYP underestimates the methanol-water
binding energy by approximately 5 kJ/mol. Inter- and
intra-molecular BLYP bond lengths are up to 0.02 and
0.06 ˚A longer compared to the MP2 results, respectively.

Vibrational frequencies are listed in Tab. II. Again
comparison of CPMD and ADF is excellent, consis-
tent with the results for the energetics and geometries.
Comparing the calculated ﬁnite-temperature frequencies
against the experimental values shows that BLYP tends
to underestimate the frequencies of almost all modes by
≈ 10 %. This trend is a known feature of BLYP. For
example similar deviations are observed for BLYP calcu-
lation of water. [15]

Overall we conclude that the reference calculations of
gas-phase provides conﬁdence that DFT-BLYP performs
with a suﬃcient accuracy for a quantitative study of
methanol hydration.

SOLVATION

We performed Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics
simulations of
the solvation of a single methanol
molecule. We considered two systems: one with 31 water
molecules and the other with 63 water molecules, yield-
ing methanol-water solutions with mole ratios of 1:31
and 1:63.
In the following they are referred to as the
small and large system, respectively. For reference we
also performed a simulation of a pure water sample of
32 molecules. The molecules are placed in a periodic cu-
bic box with edges of 9.98 ˚A (small solvated methanol
system), 12.50 ˚A (large solvated methanol system), and
9.86 ˚A (pure water) corresponding to the experimental
densities at ambient conditions. The temperature of the
ions is ﬁxed at 300 K using a Nos´e-Hoover thermostat
[24–26]. The ﬁctitious mass associated with the plane-
wave coeﬃcients is chosen at 900 a.u., which allowed for
a time step in the numerical integration of the equations-
of-motion of 0.145 fs. The two systems were equilibrated
for 1 ps from an initial conﬁguration obtained by a force-
ﬁeld simulation. Subsequently we gathered statistical av-
erages from a 10 ps trajectory of the 31+1 molecule sys-
tem, from a 7 ps trajectory of the 63+1 molecule system,
and from a 10 ps trajectory of the pure water system.

Structure

In Fig. 2 we have plotted the radial distribution func-
tions (RDF) of the water oxygen atoms. The minor vari-
ations among the RDF’s of the small methanol system,
the large methanol system, and the pure water system
is an indication that the local water structure, as mea-
sured by this RDF, is at only marginally changed by the
solvation of a methanol molecule. Note, in this respect,
that for the 32 molecule the ﬁrst solvation shell consti-
tutes a signiﬁcant fraction of the total number of water
molecules (see below).

shell of water molecules at a distance of ≈3.7 ˚A. Com-
paring the RDF’s of the small and large system shows
a noticeable diﬀerence. This should be attributed to
the limited size of the small system.
It suggests that
a proper description of the solvation structure of a single
methanol in a cubic periodic simulation box requires at
least 50 water molecules.
Integrating the RDF for the
large system up to the minimum at r = 5.0 ˚A yields 16
water molecules in the ﬁrst solvation shell. The deﬁnite
solvation shell observed in our simulations is consistent
with the neutron diﬀraction data of Soper and Finney [5]
who studied a 1:9 molar methanol-water system. Diﬀer-
ences in molarity limits a quantitative comparison of the
carbon-oxygen RDF, but a qualitative comparison learns
that peak positions match with the peak values slightly
more pronounced in the simulation results.

To analyze the orientational ordering of the water
molecules around the methanol we computed the distri-
bution function of the angle between the C-OH2O bond
vector and the normal to the plane of the water molecules
in the ﬁrst solvation shell. The results show that angle
distribution is relatively uniform with a small tendency
towards the tangential orientation, a feature occurs for all
solvation shell radii in the range of 3.7-5.0 ˚A. Over the
range of 0o-90o the distribution gradually decays, with
the value at the tangential orientation (0o) about a factor
of 2 larger than at the perpendicular orientation (90o).
Qualitatively, this seems consistent with data for the ori-
entational distribution obtained from neutron-diﬀraction
data [5]. However from this experimental data it is con-
cluded that the water molecules prefer to lie tangential
and form a cage around the methanol. Our data do not
give clear evidence for a cage-like structure. However,
this might be a diﬀerent interpretation from similar data.
Note, in this respect, also that the experimental data can-
not be quantitatively compared to our data, as diﬀerent
orientational distribution functions are employed.

To analyze the hydrogen bonding we adopted the def-
inition of Ref. [7]: two molecules are hydrogen bonded
if simultaneously the inter-oxygen distance is less than
3.5 ˚Aand the OHO angle is smaller than 30o. From
the simulation of the large system we found that the
methanol hydroxyl group donates and accepts on average
0.9 and 1.5 hydrogen bonds, respectively. For a water
molecule these numbers are equal and measured to be
1.7 in the simulation of the pure water sample. These
results indicate that the methanol hydroxyl group par-
ticipates strongly in the hydrogen bonding network with
the a donating behavior similar to water hydrogen and a
accepting character somewhat smaller than a water oxy-
gen.

Dynamics

Fig. 2 also shows the RDF of the methanol carbon and
water oxygens for the small and large methanol system.
A pronounced ﬁrst peak clearly indicates the existence of

The time scale (7-10 ps) of the present simulations al-
lows for a reliable analysis of dynamical properties oc-
curring on the picosecond time scale.

The velocity auto correlation function (VACF) of the
hydrogen atoms provides an important measure of hy-
drogen bonding. Fig. 3 shows the Fourier spectrum
of the calculated VACF of hydrogen atoms of the wa-
ter molecules in the small and large methanol sample.
The three distinct peaks correspond to the vibrational
(3100 cm−1), bending (1600 cm−1), and librational-
translational (500 cm−1) modes of the water molecules.
The most important observation is that mutual compar-
ison of the two methanol samples and the comparison of
these with the spectrum of the pure water sample (also
plotted) shows no signiﬁcant diﬀerence, not even for the
small methanol sample where the solvation shell consti-
tutes half of the water molecules in the system. This
demonstrates that also the short-time dynamics of the
water molecules is hardly aﬀected by the solvation of a
methanol molecule.

An indication for the average residence time of a water
molecule in the ﬁrst solvation shell is obtained by moni-
toring the trajectories of the individual water molecules.
We found that in the large methanol system over 7 ps
10 water molecules left the region within 5 ˚A from the
methanol carbon. From this we estimate the average res-
idence time to be of the order of a few picoseconds.

Fig. 3 shows the Fourier spectrum of the VACF of the
hydroxyl H of methanol obtained from the trajectory of
the large system. The spectrum is of limited accuracy
due to the relatively short trajectories (7 ps). For com-
parison, the calculated spectrum for a single methanol
molecule at T = 200 K is also plotted. In solution the
OH stretch (νOH) peak, with a calculated gas-phase po-
sition of about 3300 cm−1, has shifted by ≈ 200 cm−1 to
lower frequencies and has a relatively large width. The
shift and width are both typical characteristics of a hy-
drogen bond and are also observed in the water spec-

4

trum (Fig. 3). In contrast to the OH stretch mode, we
see that the OH-bending mode (δOH at 1300 cm−1) is
blue-shifted by an amount of 50-100−1. A comparison
with experimental frequency shifts in infrared spectra is
limited as, to our knowledge, no experimental data for
dilute methanol-water solutions are reported. However,
a comparison with measured shifts in liquid methanol
[27] shows similar trends for the shift of infrared stretch
(-354 cm−1) and bend (+78 cm−1) peaks. The torsional
mode (τOH), expected to be shifted upward to around
600 cm−1, is not visible in our calculated spectra due to
the large statistical errors.

DISCUSSION

We have studied the solvation of a single methanol
molecule in water using DFT-based Car-Parrinello
molecular dynamics simulation. Validation of the ap-
proach showed that energetics, structural, and dynam-
ical properties of reference gas-phase compounds were
suﬃcient to expect a quantitative accuracy of calculated
properties.

The calculated solvation structure supports the exper-
imental observation [5] that a shell of about 15 water
molecules is formed around the methanol. Structural
analysis also learns that the hydrogen bonded network
of water is only minimally distorted by the presence of
the methanol molecule. This conﬁrms the proposition
of Soper et al. [5] that speculations that the normal wa-
ter structure is signiﬁcantly enhanced by the hydropho-
bic alkyl group is groundless. The calculations showed
that methanol OH group is strongly involved in hydro-
gen bonding, both as acceptor and as donor. Analysis
of the dynamics learns that the average residence time
of a water molecule in the ﬁrst solvation shell is of the
order of a few picoseconds. The vibrational spectrum of
the water molecules is hardly changed by the presence
of the methanol, indicating that the short-time dynam-
ics is hardly aﬀected by the presence of the methanol
molecule. Vibrational analysis shows that methanol OH-
stretch peak is a broad feature that is signiﬁcantly red-
shifted upon solvation, conﬁrming its hydrogen-bonding
character.

In conclusion, from comparison with available exper-
imental data we have shown that ﬁrst-principle DFT-
based molecular dynamics simulation provides a reason-
able accurate description of the structure and dynamics
of a dilute aqueous methanol solution. This opens the
way towards the study of chemistry involving methanol
and larger alcohols in water.

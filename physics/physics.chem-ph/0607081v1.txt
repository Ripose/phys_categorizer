Abstract

Herein, we present analytical solutions for the electronic energy eigenvalues of the hydrogen molecular
ion H+
2 , namely the one-electron two-ﬁxed-center problem. These are given for the homonuclear case
for the countable inﬁnity of discrete states when the magnetic quantum number m is zero i.e. for 2Σ+
states. In this case, these solutions are the roots of a set of two coupled three-term recurrence relations.
The eigensolutions are obtained from an application of experimental mathematics using Computer
Algebra as its principal tool and are vindicated by numerical and algebraic demonstrations. Finally,
the mathematical nature of the eigenenergies is identiﬁed.

1 Introduction

Although, there are well established software packages in the area of quantum chemistry such as GAUS-
SIAN [1], MOLPRO [2] and GAMESS [3] which allow to obtain approximate numerical solutions to a
number of fair sized molecules, the simplest molecule namely the hydrogen molecular ion, a quantum
mechanical three-body problem, still remains mathematically intractable.

In the ﬁxed nuclei approximation, it is well known that the Schr¨odinger wave equation - a second order
partial differential equation (PDE) - of the problem of one electron moving in the ﬁeld of two ﬁxed nuclei
can be separated in prolate-spheroidal coordinates [4]. These coordinates allow a separation of variables
that results in two non-trivial ordinary differential equations (ODE), and hence two eigenparameters: the
energy parameter p2, and a separation constant A related to the total orbital angular momentum and the
Runge-Lenz vector.

We note that asymptotic expansions for small or large internuclear distances R have been obtained. A
very comprehensive presentation of the energy eigenvalues for the ground state and a number of exited
states is shown in the work of ˇC´ıˇzek et al. [9]. These could almost constitute analytical solutions but
the resulting series are divergent though asymptotic [10] and therefore useful only at large internuclear
distances. Another complication is that for the homonuclear case, every gerade energy Eg (wave function
symmetric under exchange of nuclei) has a counterpart ungerade solution (wave function antisymmetric
under exchange of nuclei) whose energy Eu has exactly the same 1/R expansion. This makes the calcu-
Eg very elusive to calculate at large R, although there
lation of exchange energy splittings ∆E = Eu −
are specialized methods for recovering these splittings (e.g. see [11]).

Even recently, there has been examination of series in small R limited to the ground state short-range in-
teraction energy [12] but we still have no further insight into the actual mathematical nature governing the
energy eigenvalues. We also cite the work of Demkov et al. [13] but their analytical solutions correspond
to a peculiar charge ratio depending on the internuclear distance and therefore not physically useful.

Thus, complete analytical solutions of the eigenstates of H+
the region near the equilibrium internuclear distance (bond length) of the ground state remain elusive.

2 , in areas of molecular interest, such as e.g.

A wide variety of numerical methods have been used to solve the H+
2 problem in this case. For example,
Bates, Ledsham and Stewart [5] used recursion and continued fractions. Hunter and Pritchard [6] used
matrix methods and Rayleigh quotient iteration. Madsen and Peek [7] used power series and associated
Legendre expansions to set up two equations whose simultaneous solution then gave the two eigenpa-
rameters. An accurate way to obtain energies and wavefunctions for the one-electron two-center problem
is provided by the program ODKIL conceived by Aubert-Fr´econ et al. [14, 15] based on a method by
Killingbeck. As of the 1980s, it was possible to calculate the eigenenergies and the eigenfunctions of
the discrete states of H+
2 with a rapid FORTRAN program. Yet, complete analytical solutions have so
far remained elusive: the classical N -body problem cannot be solved in closed form for N
3 and the
quantum counterpart is even worse by virtue of being an eigenvalue problem.

≥

The approach used here is called “experimental mathematics”, an unorthodox approach involving multi-
disciplinary activities by which to ﬁnd new mathematical patterns and conjectures. The goal in this context
is to search and ﬁnd mathematical structures and patterns to be re-examined with more “rigor” at a later
stage. The level of rigor is of course relative: in dealing with a difﬁcult problem in applied Mathematics,
we cannot approach the level of rigor demanded in number theory. Nonetheless, we desire demonstrations
sufﬁciently convincing to the molecular physicist.

The present work will involve a combination of methods, results and procedures from different areas.
We ﬁrst start with results from what is called: dimensional scaling. It has been known for some time
that the Schr¨odinger wave equation can be generalized to an arbitrary number of dimensions D which
1+, the hydrogen
can be subsequently treated as continuous variable [17, 18].
molecular ion becomes the double well Dirac Delta function model which can be solved exactly [25] in
terms of the Lambert W function [19, 20]. Dimensional scaling applied to H+
2 has been studied at length
by Hershbach’s group [21–24], in particular, by Frantz [21], Loeser and Lopez-Cabrera [22,23]. The latter
work provides even more insight into the mathematical relationship between the real H+
2 at D = 3 and its
one-dimensional limit.

In the limit as D

→

Next, armed with the information provided by dimensional scaling, we will return to the real three-
dimensional formulation of Aubert et al. [15]. This formulation is re-examined using a Computer Algebra
System (CAS) within the approach of experimental mathematics: patterns and results are obtained. The
CAS used is Maple because it is readily available to us but the results could also be implemented on other
systems. The resulting series expansions are veriﬁed numerically and algebraically. In particular, we will
demonstrate that our results are independent of choice of basis and basis size and consequently completely
general. The end-result will be then analytically compared with the one-dimensional result and put on a

near equal footing allowing us to ﬁnd the mathematical category to which belong the eigenvalues of H+
2 .
In view of the type of solution obtained, a tentative “physical” picture is associated with the analytical
solutions. A summary with concluding remarks is made at the end.

where
represent respectively the symmetric or gerade solution and the anti-symmetric or ungerade solu-
tion and W is the Lambert W function satisfying W (t)eW (t) = t [19,20]. This function ﬁrst introduced by
Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728-1777), a contemporary of Euler, has been “invented” and “re-invented”
at various periods in history but its ubiquitous nature was not fully realized within the last decade or so.

For example, the W function appears in Wien’s Displacement Law of Blackbody radiation. In general, it
has appeared in electrostatics, statistical mechanics, general relativity, radiative transfer, quantum chromo-
dynamics, combinatorial number theory, fuel consumption and population growth etc. . . (e.g. see ref. [27]
and references herein).

More recently, the Lambert W function has also appeared in “linear” gravity two-body problem [28] as
a solution to the Einstein Field equations with one spatial dimension and one time dimension (1 + 1).
The present work also includes a generalization of the W function. Recent work [30] shows that the W
function can be further generalized to express solutions to transcendental algebraic equations of the form:

exp(

c x) =

±

PN (x)
QM (x)

where PN (x) and QM (x) are polynomials in x of respectively degrees N and M and c is a constant. The
standard W function applies for cases when N = 1 and M = 0 and expresses solutions for the case of
equal charges for eq. (1) or equivalently the case of equal masses for the two-body 1 + 1 linear gravity
problem. The case of unequal charges or unequal masses corresponds to cases of higher N and M values.
This form also expresses a subset of the solutions to the three-body linear gravity problem [29, 30] where
one deals with transcendental equations of the form (6) where M, N

This formula agrees with the numerically accurate eigenenergy (as given by program ODKIL or the work
of D. Frantz) to within about 2 or 3 digits for the range of R near the bond length. The result at D
→ ∞
involves the extrema of a Hamiltonian expression [23, eq.(58)]. We re-examined this result. One has to
consider a region of R divided by Rc = 9
√3. For R < Rc, the root is determined by the root of a
8
quartic polynomial [23] and the result for R > Rc is determined by a sixth degree polynomial. Thus, the
1+ is in terms of an implicit special
result at D
function, which is the Lambert W function. Given how well this interpolation formulation works, this
already suggests what is the mathematical nature of the eigenenergies of the true hydrogen molecular ion

We can state this in view of the work of Frantz et al. [21] who showed that the D-dimensional problem
could be decoupled into two coupled ODEs for 2
and how a particular energy eigenvalue for a

through a precise re-scaling.

Although the set of quantum numbers (n, ℓ, m) - the united atom quantum numbers - can be used to
identify the eigenstates, as is the case for e.g. program ODKIL, it must be emphasized that only the
magnetic quantum number m is a good quantum number (resulting from the azimuthal symmetry of H+

Of course, we realize that this choice of basis is only one of several possible choices. The results obtained
are valid provided the results are independent of the size of the basis and the choice of basis.

3.2 Recurrence Relations

The following relations apply to the homonuclear case and when m = 0 in which case, the band matrices
are purely tridiagonal matrices. These are governed by recurrence relations namely (A.1) and (A.2) of
reference [15]:

det[M0] = 1
det[M1] = m1,1

Note that the radial equations for the hydrogen atom are governed by two-term recurrence relations. Thus,
it sufﬁces to ﬁnd an eigenenergy such that the coefﬁcient ak+1 of the basis of Laguerre functions is zero.

i.e. a Laurent polynomial in p with coefﬁcients in R only. When the size of the i

of the resulting expression increases dramatically (expression swell). However, from a numerical point of
view, the most useful outcome comes from numerically solving the simultaneous expressions for det(
Y i)
and det(
F i) since i must be sufﬁciently large to give a sufﬁciently good result near the bond length. In
Maple, this can be done using the fsolve procedure. To ﬁnd the minimum energy for the ground state,
it is a matter of getting derivatives of these determinants with respect to R. Combining the latter with the

Note that the electronic energy, evaluated at R = 2.0 a.u. for comparison, is as expected exactly the
reference tabulated value of Madsen and Peek [7] i.e.
0.6026342144949. An indirect way of ascertain-
ing the accuracy of electronic energies is to use these values in an adiabatic standard scheme to obtain
vibrational energies which are directly comparable to highly accurate values provided by approaches that
do not involve the separability of the electronic and nuclear motions (e.g. [31–33] and [34, 35]). This has
been done [36] and comparisons with values from the literature are displayed in table 3.2.

In fact, given how heavy the nuclear centers are with respect to the electron, clamping the nuclear centers
is a very good approximation for the quantum three-body problem represented by H+
2 with the following
caveat: the approximation that the nuclei are clamped ﬁxed in space creates a symmetry under exchange
of nuclei in the homonuclear case. A different picture arises when the movement of nuclei is considered.
The mere movement of the nuclei breaks the symmetry under exchange of nuclei and thereby leads to a
localization of the states. In this case, the work of Esry and Sadeghpour is instructive [37].

However, if one stopped here, there is no pattern from an analytical point of view. E.g. setting x = p2

If we look at A = 0 and grab the leading coefﬁcient p2, we have the sequence
2162160 . . .. Not only are the coefﬁcients increasing dramatically in size, they also alter-

nate in sign. Although the roots A, p of these determinants det(

i, the actual coefﬁcients of these determinants and especially those of the resultant increase in size becom-
ing more and more cumbersome although a CAS can handle them (up to a point).

Moreover, we have made a particular choice of basis and the combined set of polynomial-like expressions
for the determinants though numerically useful could be viewed more as a computational “model” rather
than anything truly representative of the wave function. If we stop here, we see no pattern. Insight comes
from inverting the problem.

3.3 Roots of Determinants

Y i) or det(
F k−1) has a coefﬁcient in p4 whereas the term in det(

F i) cannot be solved in closed form. We start with
The three-term recurrence relations for det(
F i) because it is easier and has no explicit dependence on R. Upon careful scrutiny of eqs. (19) and
det(
F k) has terms at order p2. Let
(20), the term in det(
us assume that p is small, which is indeed the case for small R. We can therefore neglect the last term in
F k−1) and the resulting two-term recurrence relation becomes trivial to solve. It is merely a matter
det(
of compounding the multiplicative terms of the recursion:

The reverted series of x in terms of λ can be obtained in a number of ways including Lagrange’s method [4]

the inﬁnite series in λ is a complete solution. The issue of getting numbers for e.g. λ = 1 is a matter of a

and our computer algebra programs allow us to generate many more such coefﬁcients. The ﬁrst three non-
vanishing terms of the Taylor series for A(p2) have already been published for cases of small p consistent
with small internuclear distances R [38–40]. We now claim that the present algorithm provides a means
of generating the Taylor series of A in small x where x = p2, the result being valid as i
and thus
independent of the size of the truncated basis. Later, we will demonstrate it to be independent of the actual
choice of basis. However, the ﬁrst test concerns numerical vindication.

→ ∞

3.4 Numerical vindication of the Series for A(p2)

To vindicate the series, we obtain data entries of R, p and A from program ODKIL and inject the data
entries of p into the series solutions for A. We then compare the latter with the value of A obtained
from ODKIL for a given state. This is done for the ground state and a few excited states as shown in the
following tables. The results for the ground state i.e. 1s σg (n = 1, ℓ = 0, m = 0) are shown in table 2 and
those of state 2s σg (n = 2, ℓ = 0, m = 0) are shown in table 3 demonstrating that the same series of A
for a given ℓ works for more than one state. The results for the excited state 2p σu (n = 2, ℓ = 1, m = 0)
vindicate the series solution for ℓ = 1. The results for state 3d σg (n = 3, ℓ = 2, m = 0) vindicate the
series solution for A for ℓ = 2.

In all cases, we can see that the series obtained for A(p2) works indeed like a Taylor series, working
very well for small p. Beyond a certain value of R, the series solution rapidly degenerates. Nonetheless,
e.g. for the ground state, the series solution works well near the bond length (around R = 2 which is
underlined) and beyond. Degradation of the series becomes apparent at R = 5.

The question arises as to whether or not the series coefﬁcients of A(p2) follow a pattern. We have found
is not one of alternating series and thus this function
none so far. The pattern of the changing signs +,
is unlike all the special functions known in the literature (such as e.g. [41]).

−

Nonetheless, there is something of a pattern for a given series when modifying the quantum number ℓ,
term by term. The ﬁrst two terms a0 and a1 follow a pattern in ℓ according to e.g. (23) for even ℓ. No
such simple pattern exists for the next term a2. However, if one solves for a2 in terms of a0 and a1 for
a high value of ℓ, say ℓ = ℓmax, one obtains a polynomial formula for a2. If one then substitutes the
general formulae in ℓ for a0 and a1 into this polynomial expression for a2: it will correctly generate the
coefﬁcients a2 not only for ℓmax but for all ℓ = 0, 1, 2 . . . ℓmax. At some point, the resulting formula
will break down for a value of ℓ > ℓmax. This “triangular” relationship, - useful because one often does
calculations within for a limited range of ℓ - indicates that:

a2 ≈

Next, the sum can be calculated using non-linear transformations known as the Levin or Sidi transfor-
mations. The latter involves a series transformation by which one can accelerate the convergence of
a series and even sum divergent series (e.g.
see the work of [43, 44]). We take the point of view
that a Taylor or asymptotic series has all the desired “information”, getting numbers from the series
is a matter of a summation technique. These transformations are available in the Maple system as
NonlinearTransformations.

The best results for the ground state are obtained by applying a Sidi d transformation in x compounded
with y as shown in table 6. Even when the modiﬁed series behaves badly, the result from the Sidi d
transformation provides reliable numbers. The results hold up remarkably well all the way up to R = 10
and beyond. Beyond R = 10, the asymptotic series expansions as e.g. listed by ˇC´ıˇzek et al. [9] are more
useful. What is important in our case, is that our series solution works so well around the bond length and
the intermediate regime.

the radius r can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. Matching the asymptotic solution at
0 necessitates the elimination of the irregular solution by forcing

3.6 Other Bases - Algebraic Vindication

Although our previous results are apparently independent of the size of the chosen basis, we must con-
sider other bases. For the η coordinate, we consider the Baber-Hass´e and the Wilson bases [14] which are
described as follows.

Baber-Hass´e:

Both of these bases have been implemented into the Maple system. If we consider ℓ = 0, the coefﬁcient
aN of Baber-Hass´e basis is of order O(1/pN ) and the coefﬁcient cN of Wilson basis is of order O(p0).
However, if we inject our series solution for A(p2) into the series coefﬁcients of both bases, we ﬁnd that
both aN and cN are formally zero to within order O(pN ). This can be seen through a number of computer
algebra demonstrations. Thus our series solution for A(p2) also formally satisﬁes the recurrence relations
of these other bases, order by order in p.

For the ξ coordinate, apart from the used Hylleraas basis, there is also the Jaff´e basis.

Similarly, it can be algebraically demonstrated that e.g. for  = n

of A(R, p) formally satisﬁes the coefﬁcients of the Jaff´e basis for negative powers of p just as they satisfy
the Hylleraas basis. This demonstration allows us to consider another basis of importance for the η coor-
dinate, namely the Power basis:

Granted, we have not proven this for all bases. Nonetheless, we emphasize that e.g.
is very different from the Baber-Hass´e basis or the Power Basis and the basis of spherical harmonics we
used as a starting point for this analysis. Moreover, the Hylleraas basis is also very different from the Jaff´e
basis. These demonstrations strongly suggest basis independent results for A(p2) and A(R, p).

This analysis herein exploits the fundamental theorem of algebra i.e.
that if one knows all the N roots
of a given polynomial say PN (x), the latter is completely deﬁned within a scaling factor namely the
coefﬁcient of its highest power in x. The three-term recurrence relations of eqs. (19), (20) and (18) have
a linear dependence on A for the term in dk but no dependence of A for the third term in dk−1. Thus,

So far, we have identiﬁed the functions implied by the determinants det(

and recent work on the D

of H+

When the second order polynomial P2(d) factors into a product of ﬁrst order polynomials, both
sides of eq. (47) factors and the solution for d is a (standard) Lambert W function [19, 20]. When it
does not factor, the solution is a generalization of the W function reported in the work of [28]. When
the right side is a polynomial, the solution is a generalized Lambert W function [30]. The subscript
PN (d) reminds us that our generalization for the W function can accommodate a polynomial with
rational coefﬁcients of arbitrary degree on the right side of eq. (47).

The exponential term on the left side is a reﬂection of the fact that outside the Dirac delta function
wells, the basis of the particle is a combination of free particle solutions which required matching
at the Dirac delta function peaks.

The subscript PN (p) reminds us that we have a Taylor series for A(p2) with rational coefﬁcients

Mathematically, in both cases, the right side of the governing equation is expressed in terms of only one of

We therefore come to the conclusion that the eigenparameter p, like its D
1 counterpart d, is also deter-
mined by a special function which is an implicit function, an even greater generalization of the Lambert W
function. So far, the functions A(R, p) and A(p2) do not appear in the literature. However, we can obtain
series representations of both to the extent of getting reliable numbers, as demonstrated by our tables of
values.

→

On the subject of implicit functions or implicit equations, these are seen in a number of speciﬁc contexts:

Retardation Effects: Equations of form e−c λ = P2(λ) and more generally e−cλ = P2(λ)/Q1(λ) ex-

press the solutions of a huge class of delayed differential equations [46, eq.(3)].

Bondi’s K-calculus: It is well known in the area of special relativity that the Lorentz transformation can
be derived from the theory of implicit functions with minimal assumptions of continuity [47]. Here
one seeks the function f (t) satisfying f (f (t)) = k2t and the requirements that it be monotone
increasing and continuous. The unique solution is:

f (f (t)) = k2t where

v/c = k2

1/k2

f (t) = k t

−

→

GRT/QFT: As we mentioned before, the Lambert W function and its generalization appear in General
Relativity as solutions to respectively the two-body and three-body linear (1 + 1) gravity problems
via dilaton theory [28, 29].

Implicit functions often appear in problems with retardation effects, relativistic or otherwise. Thus, with
some reservations, we associate with this mathematical category a tentative “physical picture”:

Although the hydrogen molecular ion H+
2 in the context of the Schr¨odinger wave equation is not a rela-
tivistic formulation, the eigensolutions we obtain nonetheless suggests something akin to a retardation or
delay effect. This is not the case for a one center problem like the hydrogen atom but this characteristic
appears for a two-center problem. However, this statement must be tempered with the fact that e.g.
the
Lambert W function also appears in many other types of problems with no relationship to retardation
effects.

4 Summary/Conclusions

Through experimental Mathematics using computer algebra as a tool, we have identiﬁed the mathemati-
cal structures governing the energy spectrum of the hydrogen molecular ion H+
2 for the two-center one-
electron problem.

In the present work, we started with a particular choice of basis and expressed the determinantal conditions
by which the eigenparameters p and A are obtained. From one of the two determinants, we inverted the

6
problem to obtain a series representation of the separation constant A(p2) associated with the united atom
quantum number ℓ. We applied a similar approach to obtain A(R, p) from the remaining determinant and
associated with the separated atom quantum number  = n
1. where n is a united quantum number.
We then demonstrated that the results were independent of the size and even the choice of basis.

recent generalizations [30]. This allowed us to mathematically categorize the eigenvalues (or rather make
us realize what they are not) and even to associate a tentative “physical picture” to the solutions. While
we made no pretense at rigor, the solutions were nonetheless vindicated numerically and by algebraic
demonstrations with computer algebra.

The results express analytical solutions for the ground state and the countable inﬁnity of discrete states of
H+

eq. (48), we anticipate that the eigensolutions for m

A(R, p) in 1/p.

overdue because of our present capacity to ﬁnd solutions to fair-sized molecules using computational
chemistry. On the other hand, it is premature. The functions we found A(p2) and A(R, p) do not seem
to resemble anything we have seen in the literature. The apparent singularities or “resonances” at 2p2 =
3 (4 j + 3)(4 j + 7) for A(p2) and R = (j + 2) p + 2 p2 for A(R, p) for j = 0, 1, 2, . . . do not constitute
a problem since the eigenparameters p and A for a given R are never found on these resonances. Once
a value of R is injected into A(p2) = A(R, p), solving for p numerically did not create any problems
in the test cases examined so far. At any rate, the tables shown herein merely illustrate the convergence
properties of the functions A(p2) and A(R, p) we have identiﬁed: solving the coupled set of polynomials
Y i) for p and A at a given distance R involves no resonances and is still the most useful
det(
method from a computational point of view. In principle, the latter can go further than any FORTRAN
program.

F i) and det(

We have ordered series representations to relatively high order of both of these functions A(p2) and
A(R, p) and we can generate reliable numbers for a number of discrete quantum states. We have also
demonstrated that we could use these series beyond their radius of convergence using techniques for han-
dling divergent series.

From here, one could explore and seek alternate representations of these functions with better convergence
properties especially at low R for A(R, p) and large R for A(p2) but the results from the Sidi transfor-
mations are already very promising. At any rate, the hydrogen molecular ion for clamped nuclei can be
entirely contained within simple computer algebra sessions, not much more complicated than those of the
hydrogen atom1.

The exploratory and roundabout way by which we found our solutions, suggests there is something miss-

ing in the mathematical physics or the methods for obtaining the eigenvalues of the Schr¨odinger wave
equation. There is hardly any existing “technology” for solving quantum chemistry problems involving
implicit functions. Our use of a basis is certainly valid to demonstrate or prove a result. Furthermore,
the convergence of the bases used here has been conﬁrmed by determining the asymptotic behavior of
the expansion coefﬁcients of the wavefunctions for the various basis sets considered [40]. Nonetheless, a
more direct way of generating the functions of A(p2) and A(R, p) would be instructive.

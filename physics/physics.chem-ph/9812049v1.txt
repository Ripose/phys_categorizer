ABSTRACT
A program for molecular calculations with B functions is reported and its performance is
analyzed. All the one- and two-center integrals, and the three-center nuclear attraction
integrals are computed by direct procedures, using previously developed algorithms. The
three- and four-center electron repulsion integrals are computed by means of Gaussian
expansions of the B functions. A new procedure for obtaining these expansions is also
reported. Some results on full molecular calculations are included to show the capabilities
of the program and the quality of the B functions to represent the electronic functions in
molecules.

Introduction

Although there is a general agreement in the best quality of exponential type orbitals
(ETO) for describing the electronic function in atoms and molecules [1], the diﬃculties
in solving some molecular integrals (in particular the three- and four-center two-electron
repulsion integrals) have strongly restricted their use in molecular calculations, in beneﬁt
of the more easy to handle Gaussian type orbitals (GTO).
In a previous article [2], a program for molecular calculations with Slater type orbitals
(STO) has been reported.
In that program, some of the molecular integrals (all the
one- and two-center and the three-center nuclear attraction) were computed by direct
algorithms, and the remaining ones by means of Gaussian expansions of the STO. The
aim of that program was to provide a bridge and a reference for further works in this
ﬁeld, mainly to those dealing with the direct calculation of all the integrals. The present
work has been developed in the same spirit, using in this case a diﬀerent type of ETO,
the reduced Bessel functions (B functions) that have been already proposed by Steinborn
et al. [3, 4] for molecular calculations.
In the real case, the B functions are deﬁned as:

being the corresponding Legendre functions [6], and the functions Φ are deﬁned as:

Φm(φ) =

(

The simplicity of the Fourier transform of the B functions has been proposed as an advan-
tage to be exploited in the development of algorithms for molecular integrals calculations
with this kind of ETO [3, 4].
In the next sections, the algorithms used in the program will be summarized and some
results will be reported to show the quality of the B functions for molecular calculations
and to compare with both the commonly used Gaussian functions and with the STO.

2 Algorithms

The present program for molecular integrals with B functions closely follows the scheme
of that previously reported for the STO [2]. The one- and two-center and the three-
center nuclear attraction integrals are computed by direct procedures previously developed
[3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10] and the remaining ones are computed by means of Gaussian expansions
of the B functions.
The integrals computed with direct procedures are obtained with an average cost about
0.1 milliseconds per integral actually computed measured on a Digital AlphaServer 8400,
for an accuracy of at least twelve decimal places.
The remaining integrals have been computed by using Gaussian expansions, as mentioned
above. The expansions have been obtained by a procedure diﬀerent than the usual least-
squares method. This procedure, that is summarized in the appendix, is much easier to
apply than the least-squares, and yields expansions that tend to better approximate the
tails of the functions.
The integrals between the Gaussian primitives are evaluated with the algorithm proposed
by Saunders [11, 12] slightly modiﬁed, and a test for avoiding calculation of negligible
Gaussian contributions to a given set of integrals is also included.
The program for the calculation of the integrals has been implemented in a modular way,
so that the subroutines corresponding to each type of integrals can be easily replaced by
others when required. The main structure can therefore be kept unaltered when trying
new algorithms for a given type of integrals.
The package includes routines for the direct minimization of the energy in RHF and
ORHF calculations [13] but, since the integrals are stored in external ﬁles in a very easy-
to-handle way, the interface with other standard programs for minimizing the energy
(both in Hartree-Fock and post-Hartree-Fock calculations) is straightforward.

3 Results

We have ﬁrst analyzed the quality of the Gaussian expansions for representing the B
functions.
In Table 1 we collect the least-squares error of the expansions for diﬀerent
principal quantum numbers in the functions. We want to recall here that the least-squares
error has not been used as criterion for attaining the present expansions.
As it can be seen in the table, the quality of the expansions improves as the n quantum
number increases. This is so because the Gaussian expansions obtained with the current
procedure tend to better reproduce the tail of the functions, but present some problems
to reproduce the peak in the origin for the functions with n = 1. This causes a loss of
accuracy in the integrals involving these latter functions. In consequence, the program
uses expansions optimized by minimizing the least-squares error for ˆk1/2 (which are the
same as those of the STO 1s [14]), and expansions obtained with the current procedure
for the rest.
Then, we have carried out full RHF calculations on several systems to test the performance
of the program and to analyze the qualities of the B functions for molecular calculations.
The corresponding exponents of the single-zeta and double-zeta basis sets used in the
calculations are collected in Tables 2 and 3. These basis sets are optimized for atoms and
have been taken from references [15, 16]. The geometries are summarized in Table 4.
In Tables 5 and 6, the energy values and the computational cost are analyzed for ex-
pansions of diﬀerent lenght with both types of basis sets. The computational cost of the
integrals calculated by direct procedures is included in the second column of each table,
and columns 3 to 8 collect both the value of the electronic energy and the time required
for the integrals computed with the Gaussian expansions for the B-10G, B-15G and B-
20G expansions. As it can be seen in these tables, the direct procedures enable us to
obtain highly accurate integrals in a very fast way. This should spur for a further search
on direct procedures for all the integrals.
Nevertheless, an accuracy suﬃcient for testing purposes can be attained with a moderate
cost by using not very long expansions (such as the B-10G) of the B functions. In fact,
the results obtained with these expansions are also suﬃciently accurate to give an idea
about the quality of the B functions in molecular calculations. In Table 7 a comparison
between the results obtained with B and STO basis sets of same length is made. The
table clearly illustrates that, despite that the energy values with STO are slightly lower
in the single zeta basis sets, the double zeta of both types yield results of similar quality,
thus conﬁrming the capabilities of the B functions for high-quality molecular calculations.

4 Conclusions

A program for computing molecular integrals with B functions has been implemented
and tested. The program combines techniques of direct computation for the one- and
two-center integrals and the three-center nuclear attraction integrals with others based
on Gaussian expansions for the remaining ones. Direct procedures yield highly accurate
results at low computational cost. The Gaussian expansions lead to a lower ratio accu-
racy/cost, but still acceptable for calculations in medium size systems. The expansions
obtained by the moments procedure reported herein are good enough for all cases except
the ˆk1/2 function because of the peak in the origin in this latter. An expansion based in

3

the least-squares procedure is preferable in this case, and has been used in the program.
Finally, basis sets of B functions have a good quality for reproducing the electronic wave
function in molecules, comparable with that of STO.

5 Appendix: Gaussian expansions of B functions

The procedure used to obtain Gaussian expansions of the B functions is based on the
ﬁtting of the value of the functions at the origin and the moments of the unnormalized
spherical part of the B-function, i.e., an expansion:

ˆkn

functions are reproduced:

To attain directly the general solution of this latter equation can be rather diﬃcult.
However, one can start by the ﬁrst cases (N = 1, 2, ...) and proceed by induction. In this
way, it can be found that the set {ri}N

Finally, once the ri are obtained by solving Eq. (18), the ci can be readily attained by
Eq. (16) and the values of αi follow from (10).
Gaussian expansions of the sigma part of the B functions ranging from a single Gaussian
to 20 Gaussians have been obtained. The standard limits for the three- and four-center
integrals are N − L < 9.

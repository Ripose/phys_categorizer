We report on a series of chromophores that have been synthesized with a modulated conjugation
path between donor and acceptor. Hyper-Rayleigh scattering measurements of the best molecule
shows an enhanced hyperpolarizability that breaches the apparent limit.

Over the last 3 decades, many novel molecules have
been designed and synthesized to improve the nonlin-
ear response for a variety of applications. Quantum cal-
culations using sum rules have been used to place an
upper-bound on the molecular susceptibilities; [1, 2, 3, 4]
but, the largest nonlinear susceptibilities of the best
molecules fall short of the fundamental limit by a factor
of 103/2.[4, 5] A thorough analysis shows that there is
no reason why the molecular hyperpolarizability can not
exceed this apparent limit.[6] In this letter, we report on
a novel set of molecules where the one with modulated
conjugation[7] is found to have a hyperpolarizability that
breaches the apparent limit.

Past work has shown that the polarizability is largest
when the potential energy function oscillates in a way
that localizes the eigenfunctions on diﬀerent parts of the
molecule.[7] This type of oscillation can be designed into
bridge that separates the donor and acceptor ends of a
chromophore by varying the degree of conjugation. Our
approach is based on the well-known diﬀerence in aro-
matic stabilization energy between benzene and heter-
pentacyclics, such as thiophene rings.[12]

Figure 1 shows the series of molecules under study.
The synthesis and the details of the linear and nonlinear
optical characterization of this series of compounds will
be published elsewhere.[13]

The hyperpolarizability, β, was determined at 800 nm
using Hyper-Rayleigh scattering. The zero-frequency hy-
perpolarizability, β0 was determined using the two-level
model. Table I shows the measured molecular proper-
ties and Figure 2 shows a plot of β0, normalized to the
fundamental limit of the hyperpolarizability, where the

The horizontal line represents the apparent limit, which
is a factor of 103/2 below the fundamental limit.

No single molecule has ever been reported to breach the
apparent limit, though some have come close. For exam-
ple, May and coworkers have shown the the second hy-
perpolarizability gets within a factor of 2 of the apparent
limit.[8] Wang and coworkers, on the other hand, have re-
ported breaking through the apparent limit.[9] However,
a close analysis is that their system was highly inter-
acting so the chromophores where strongly interacting,
leading to an under-counting of the number of electrons.
So, we believe our reported values to be the ﬁrst example
of single chromophores that breach the limit.

Our molecular design focuses on modulating the
amount of aromatic stabilization energy along the con-
jugated bridge between the donor and the acceptor. To
induce the desired modulation, aromatic moieties with
a diﬀerent degree of aromaticity make up the asymmet-
rically substituted π-bridge. As an example, molecules
4 and 7 are both azo dyes, but while molecule 4 has 2
benzene moieties with identical (36 kcal/mol, or 1.57 eV)
aromatic stabilization energy, molecule 7 has a benzene
and a thiphene moiety. The later is well known to have

a reduced aromatic stabilization energy (29 kcal/mol, or
1.25 eV). This results in a signiﬁcant variation of the
degree of aromaticity for molecule 7, or in a modula-
tion of the conjugation between the donor and acceptor.
This degree of conjugation modulation yields an enhance-
ment in the hyperpolarizability that breaches the appar-
ent well outside the range of experimental uncertainty of

2

10%. Furthermore, the demodulation technique was used
to insure that there is no background contribution from
ﬂuorescence.[10, 11, 14]

Molecules 2 and 5 are homologues of 4 and 7; and show
a similar enhancement. However, the larger and more ge-
ometrically linear molecules show a more dramatic eﬀect,
which is predicted by the theory.[7] In particular, the best
molecules are ones that are long with many undulations
in the potential energy, which allows for the electron den-
sities of the eigenstates to be well separated. So, future
design strategies should focus on longer molecules with
stronger modulation of the conjugation.

While our best measured values of the hyperpolariz-
ability are still more than an order of magnitude from
the fundamental limit, this design strategy appears to be
a promising new paradigm for making better molecules.
In addition to increased length, future eﬀorts must also
focus on keeping the chain linear.

Special attention should be devoted to mimic the opti-
mal undulation[7] by making use of not only benzene and
thiphene, but also of other aromatic moieties that exhibit
an even wider range of stabilization energies (like pyrrole
and furan with aromatic stabilization energy values of 22
and 16 kcal/mol, or 0.98 and 0.69 eV, respectively).

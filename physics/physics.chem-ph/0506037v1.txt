Abstract

A generalization of the Kohn–Sham approach is derived where the correlation-energy functional

depend on the one-particle density matrix of noninteracting states and on the external potential

from the interacting target-state. The one-particle equations contain the exact exchange potential,

a nonlocal correlation potential, and an additional operator involving the correlation density. The

electronic-energy functional has multiple solutions: Any one-particle density matrix delivering the

target-state density yields a solution. In order to obtain the Kohn–Sham solution, the nonlocal

operators are converted into local ones using an approach developed by Sala and G¨orling. Since the

exact exchange-potential is used, and the N –representability problem does not arise—in contrast

to the Kohn–Sham approach—errors from Coulomb self-interactions do not occur, nor the need to

introduce functionals deﬁned by a constraint search. Furthermore, the approach does not use the

Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. A density functional formalism is also derived that assumes that the

one-particle density matrices of intererest have v-representable (non-interacting) densities and that

these density matrices can be written as an explicit functional of the electron density. For simplicity,

we only consider noninteracting closed-shell states and target states that are nondegenerate, singlet

ground-states.

INTRODUCTION

The Kohn-Sham version of density functional theory plays a major role in both quantum

chemistry and condensed matter physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The local density approximation

[8] has been widely used for the solid state. While for molecules, by far, the most successful

functional, a hybrid one [9, 10, 11, 12], is known as B3LYP [9, 13].

The Kohn–Sham approach, however, does have well known shortcomings. For example, a

constraint search deﬁnition [14, 15, 16, 17] is required to treat the v–representability problem

that arises in the original Kohn–Sham method [8]. Unfortunately, this formal deﬁnition is

diﬃcult to consider when deriving approximate functionals. Furthermore, in contrast to

wave function based methods, the exchange-correlation functional is an unknown, implicit

functional, and there is no systematic method to improve approximations.

In addition,

there are well known errors arising from Coulomb self-interactions that appears when using

approximate functionals [1, 2, 18]. Also, the most widely used approximate functionals

for molecular systems, the B3LYP functional, includes a component of the exact exchange-

potential, even though the Kohn–Sham approach requires the noninteracting state to come

from a local potential. The optimized potential method [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] is an

approach to convert a nonlocal operator into a local potential. Unfortunately, this method

leads to potentials that are not invariant to a unitary transformation of orbitals and depend

explicitly on the individual orbitals and orbital energies.

The formalism presented below uses an electronic energy functional containing a correla-

tion energy functional Eco that depends on the external potential v and on the one-particle

density matrix ρ1 of determinantal states. Since the v–representability problem does not

appear, a constrain search deﬁnition is not needed. Also, since the approach uses the ex-

act exchange-potential, errors from Coulomb self-interactions do not occur. The energy

functionals, however, contains multiple solutions, since any one-particle density matrix ρ1

delivering the density from the interacting state yields a solution.

In order obtain the

Kohn–Sham solution, the nonlocal operators are converted into local ones using an ap-

proach developed by Sala and G¨orling [26]. In contrast to the optimized potential method

[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], the energy functionals and local potentials are invariant to a

unitary transformation of orbitals and do not depend on the individual orbital or the orbital

energies. A density functional formalism is also derived that assumes that the one-particle

2

density matrices of interest have v-representable (non-interacting) densities and that the

one-particle density matrix can be written as an explicit functional of the electron density.

Previously we have shown that the correlation energy from many body perturbation

theory [27, 28, 29] can be written as an explicit functional of v and ρ1 [30]. In a similar

manner, but using less restrictive energy denominators, the correlation energy functionals

presented below can be shown to be an explicit functional of v and ρ1 [31]. Hence, in contrast

to the Kohn–Sham method, it maybe possible to derive approximate functionals that can

be improved in a systematic manner. For simplicity, we only consider noninteracting closed-

shell states and target states that are nondegenerate, singlet ground-states.

II. THE ENERGY FUNCTIONALS

Our interest is in ﬁnding the ground-state eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian operator,

where

ˆHN v = ˆT + ˆVee + ˆVv,

ˆVv =

and v is the external potential; N is the number of electrons. Since the Hamiltonian ˆHN v

is determined by N and v, so are the ground state wave functions |ΨN vi that satisfy the

Schr¨odinger equation:

ˆHN v|ΨN vi = EN v|ΨN vi,

where, for simplicity, we only consider wave functions that are nondegenerate, singlet ground-

states.

and it can be expressed by

Using a second quantization approach, our spin-free Hamiltonian does not depend on N,

ˆHv =

ψjσ(x) = χj(r)σ(ω); σ = α, β,

and the one- and two electrons integrals are spin-free integrals written in chemist’s notation

using a spatial orbital set, say {χ}; this set has the following form:

where the spatial and spin coordinates, r and ω, are denoted collectively by x.

Wave function-based methods including perturbation theory, conﬁguration interaction,

and coupled cluster theory, use one or more reference states to express Ψ and E. For closed-

shell ground-state wave functions, a single determinant can be used, where closed-shell

determinantal, or noninteracting, states can be constructed from a set of doubly occupied

spatial-orbitals, where these spatial orbitals also determine the spin-less one-particle density-

matrix of the noninteracting state, given by [2, 32]

ρ1(r1, r2) = 2

χw(r1)χ∗

w(r2),

Xw∈{χo}
and the sum is over the occupied orbitals; this set of orbitals is denoted by {χo}. For later

use, we also mention that for a complete basis set we have

2δ(r1, r2) = ρ1(r1, r2) + κρ1(r1, r2),

where κρ1 is determined by the excited orbitals,

κρ1(r1, r2) = 2

χr(r1)χ∗

r(r2),

Xr∈{χu}
and {χu} denotes the set of orbitals orthogonal to the occupied set {χo}. The operator form

of Eq. (11) is

where ˆI is the identity operator; so, the kernels of the three operators within Eq. (13) are

given by the corresponding terms within Eq. (11).

2 ˆI = ˆρ1 + ˆκρ1,

It is well known that there is a one-to-one mapping between determinantal states and

their one-particle density matrices [2, 33], say γ, where for a closed-shell state described by

the orbitals given by Eq. (9), we have [34, 35, 36, 37]

γ(x1, x2) =

χw(r1)χ∗

w(r2)σ(ω1)σ∗(ω2),

σ
Xw∈{χo} X

and by using Eq. (10), we obtain

γ(x1, x2) =

ρ1(r1, r2)δω1ω2.

2

Since our closed-shell determinantal states are determined by ρ1, we denote these kets by |ρ1i.

According to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [1, 2, 38], the external potential v is deter-

mined by the density, and the density also determines N. So, in principle, we can replace the

variables N and v by the electronic density n and, at least for nondegenerate ground-states,

write

ˆHv|Ψni = En|Ψni; n −→ N, v,

(16)

where these functions serve as density-dependent trial-wave functions for the Kohn-Sham
approach. Notice we have omitted the N subscript on the Hamiltonian operator, since ˆHv

is independent of N when this operator is expressed in second quantization.

As an alternative to a density-dependent wave function, we consider trial wave functions,
say | ˜Ψvρ1i, that are determined by the one-body external potential v and, in addition, by

the spin-less one-particle density-matrix ρ1 of a noninteracting state, and, as mentioned

previously, these noninteracting states are denoted by |ρ1i.

By deﬁnition, our trial wave function | ˜Ψvρ1i yields the exact ground-state wave function

|Ψni when the noninteracting density ρs, i.e., the density of |ρ1i, equals the exact density n

of the interacting state |Ψni, where n also determines the v and N. This state of aﬀairs can

be represented by the following:

| ˜Ψvρ1i = |Ψni; ρ1 −→ ρs = n, n −→ N, v.

In other words, ρ1 determines ρs, and when ρs = n, | ˜Ψvρ1i yields |Ψni. Letting ̺1 denote

the one-particle density matrix of interest, we can write

(14)

(15)

(17)

(18)

| ˜Ψv̺1i = |Ψni; ̺1 −→ n, n −→ N, v.

5

For later use, we also mention that the density n of an interacting state can be partitioned

as

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

where the correlation density is given by

and ˆΓ is the density operator, given by Eq. (A7).

Using our trial wave function, we introduce a variational energy functional:

n = ρs + ρc,

ρc(r) =

hΨn|ˆΓ(r)|Ψni
hΨn|Ψni

− ρs(r),

Ev[ρ1] =

h ˜Ψvρ1| ˆHv| ˜Ψvρ1i
h ˜Ψvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i

.

Our trial wave functions | ˜Ψvρ1i and energy functionals Ev[ρ1] are assumed to be explicit

functionals of ρ1 and v. However, two diﬀerent one-particle density matrices, say ρ1 and
′ −→ ρs, yield the same | ˜Ψvρ1i

′, that yield the same density ρs, i.e., ρ1 −→ ρs and ρ1

ρ1

and Ev[ρ1], so these functions are implicit functionals of ρs, and, therefore, we can write
| ˜Ψvρsi and Ev[ρs]. However, we will continue to consider them as functionals of their explicit

Using Eqs. (16) and (18), we observe that our energy functional Ev, given by Eq. (21),

delivers the exact energy En when the one-particle density matrix determines the exact

variable ρ1.

density n:

Ev[̺1] = En, ̺1 −→ n, n −→ N, v,

and for an arbitrary density we get

Ev[ρ1] ≥ En, ρ1 −→ ρs −→ N,

where the density ρs from the noninteracting state |ρ1i is not necessarily v-representable.

III. TRIAL WAVE FUNCTIONS AND HAMILTONIANS

Our trial wave function is a ground-state eigenfunction of a Hamiltonian operator that

depend explicitly on the one-particle density of a noninteracting state:

ˆHvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i = ˜Evρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i.

(24)

6

As in our trial wave functions | ˜Ψvρ1i and energy functionals Ev[ρ1], the trial Hamiltonians
ˆHvρ1 are explicit functionals of ρ1, but implicit functionals of ρs. So two trial Hamiltonians,
say ˆHvρ1 and ˆHvρ1

′ yield the same density, i.e., ρ1, ρ1

′, are equal if both ρ1 and ρ1

′ → ρs.

Our trial Hamiltonians must be chosen so that Eq. (18) is satisﬁed, indicating the follow-

ing identity:

ˆHv̺1 = ˆHv ̺1 −→ n, n −→ N, v.

(25)

There are many ways to obtain a trial wave function that satisﬁes Eq. (25). Consider the

following trial Hamiltonian obtained by adding a term to the Hamiltonian:

ˆHvρ1 = ˆHv + λ

ˆΓ(r) − ρs(r)
(cid:16)
where ˆΓ(r) is the density operator, given by Eq. (A7); (ˆΓ(r) − ρs(r)) is the one-body portion
of ˆΓ(r) when this operator is written in normal-ordered form [27, 39, 40, 41], given by

, ρ1 −→ ρs,

dr gρc(r)

(cid:17)

Z

Eq. (A6). Furthermore, λ is an arbitrary constant, and the functional g is also arbitrary,

except that it vanishes when the correlation density ρc vanishes

lim
ρc→0

gρc(r) = 0,

where ρc is deﬁned by Eqs. (19) and (20).

Since (ˆΓ(r) − ρs(r)) is normal-ordered, we have

Therefore, the added term appearing in Eq. (26) can be considered a sort of correlation

term, since it does not contribute in ﬁrst order. Hence, we have

One possible choice for gρc, and presented in Appendix A, is given by

IV. A GENERALIZATION OF THE KOHN-SHAM FORMALISM

We now obtain a generalization of the Kohn-Sham formalism. Substituting Eq. (1) into

Eq. (21) gives

Ev[ρ1] =

where ˜ρc is the correlation density of the trial wave function, i.e, as in Eq. (20), we have

(32)

˜ρc(r) =

h ˜Ψvρ1|ˆΓ(r)| ˜Ψvρ1i
h ˜Ψvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i

and ˜n is the density of ˜Ψvρ1.

where previously we have shown that Eco can be written as an explicit functional of v and

ρ1 [30]. In a similar manner, but using less restrictive energy denominators, our correlation

energy functional Eco, given by Eq. (38), can be shown to be an explicit functional of v and

ρ1 [31]. Therefore, by requiring the last term within Eq. (39) to be an explicit functional of

v and ρ1, Ev can also be written as an explicit functional of v and ρ1 [31].

We now focus on minimizing our energy functional Ev subject to the constraint that

the spin-less one-particle density-matrix ρ1 comes from a closed-shell single-determinantal

state. For the more general case of a determinantal state, say |γi, with the (spin-dependent)

one-particle density matrix γ, as in Eq. (14), the two necessary conditions for γ to satisfy

are given by the following [2, 33]:

(42)

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

where the ﬁrst relation indicates that the electron density yields the number of electrons N;

the second relation indicates that γ is indempotent. For our special closed-shell case, we

substitute Eq. (15) into the above constrains, yielding the following conditions:

γ(x3, x4)δ(x3 − x4) dx3dx4 = N,

γ(x3, x5)γ(x5, x4) dx5 = γ(x3, x4),

ρ1(r3, r4)δ(r3 − r4) dr3dr4 = N,

It is well know that the functional derivative of E1 with respect to the γ yields the kernel

δρ1(r2, r1)

Minimizing the functional Ev, given by Eq. (39), subject to the constraints given by

Eqs. (44) and (45), is very similar to the corresponding Hartree–Fock derivation [2] and the

derivation for reference-state one-particle density matrix theory [30, 42]. The only diﬀerence

being that the spin variable has been eliminated, and we have a factor of two appearing in

Eq. (45). Therefore, we only state the main results, i.e., this minimization yields the exact

electronic energy En for the interacting state, as given by Eq. (22), where the one-particle

density-matrix ̺1 satisﬁes the following conditions:

ˆκ̺1 ˆF̺1 ˆ̺1 = 0,

ˆ̺1 ˆF̺1 ˆκ̺1 = 0,

and the kernels of the operators ˆρ1 and ˆκρ1 are given by the terms on the right side of

Eq. (11); also, as mentioned previously, ̺1 yields the exact density n of the interacting
state Ψn. Using Eqs. (52) and (53), it is readily shown that ˆF̺1 and ˆ̺1 commute:

and the occupied orbitals satisfy a generalized Hartree–Fock equation:

x∈̺1
X
where the notation x ∈ ̺1 indicates a summation over the occupied orbitals from the deter-

minantal state |̺1i; χw is also an occupied orbital from |̺1i. Furthermore, we can choose

orbitals that diagonalize the matrix εxw, yielding exact, canonical Hartree–Fock equations:

V. CONVERSION OF THE NONLOCAL POTENTIAL INTO A LOCAL ONE

As mentioned previously, our energy functionals Ev are implicit functionals of the non-

interacting density ρs. Hence, any one-particle density-matrix that yields the interacting

density minimizes our energy functional, i.e., we have

En = Ev[̺1] = Ev[̺′

1] = Ev[̺′′

1] · · · ,

where

n(r) = ̺1(r, r) = ̺′

1(r, r) = ̺′′

1(r, r) · · · ,

and there are other solutions besides Eq. (56), e.g,

ˆF̺′

(cid:1)

Assuming n is a noninteracting v-representable density, there exist a noninteracting state,

say |ϕ1i, that has n as its density:

and vs is a local potential. Therefore, the canonical occupied orbitals from |ϕ1i satisfy the

following one-particle Schr¨odinger equation:

ˆf φw =

J + vxc

φw = ǫwφw, φw ∈ ϕ1,

where with no loss of generality, we have required vs to be deﬁned by

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

By deﬁnition, or using Eqs. (60), (61), and (64), ϕ1 is a one-particle density matrix that

minimizes our energy functional:

vs = v + ˆvn

J + vxc.

En = Ev[ϕ1],

and, therefore, ϕ1 also satisﬁes Eq. (59):

Hence, it follows from Eqs. (65) and (70) that |ϕ1i is an eigenstate of two diﬀerent nonin-

teracting Hamiltonians. By comparing Eq. (62) and (67) with ̺′
1 = ϕ1, we see that the two
operators, ˆFϕ1 and ˆf , are identical, except that ˆFϕ1 contains the nonlocal operator ˆwϕ1 and
ˆf contains the local potential vxc. Furthermore, the occupied orbitals from Eq. (62) and (67)

with ̺′

1 = ϕ1 may diﬀer by a unitary transformation, but they yield the same one-particle

density matrix:

ϕ1(r1, r2) = 2

χw(r1)χ∗

w(r2) = 2

φw(r1)φ∗

w(r2).

Using the approach by Sala and G¨orling [26], and Eqs. (65), (70), (62) and (67), but

permitting the orbitals to be complex, it is readily demonstrated that vxc is given by

vxc(r) =

dr1 [2w(r1, r)ϕ1(r, r1) − ϕ1(r, r1)

By substituting vxc repeatedly on the right side we can obtain an expansion for vxc:

vxc(r) =

[2w(r1, r)ϕ1(r, r1) − ϕ1(r, r1)ϕ1(r2, r)w(r1, r2)

where the leading term is the Slater potential [43, 44, 45], which also appears as the leading

term from the Krieger–Li–Iafrate (KLI) approximation of the OPM [19, 22, 45, 46].

The orbitals φw satisfying Eq. (67) are the Kohn–Sham orbitals [8]; |ϕ1i is the Kohn–Sham
noninteracting state. However, ˆf diﬀers from the Kohn–Sham operator, since, in addition
to depending explicitly ϕ1, instead of n, ˆf depends explicitly on the external potential v
from the interacting Hamiltonian ˆHv. Furthermore, the external-correlation operator ˆvρ1
ec

does not appear in Kohn–Sham formalism. In addition, unlike the Kohn–Sham approach,

the N-representability problem does not arise, nor the need to introduce a constraint-search

deﬁnition [14, 15, 16, 17] to avoid this problem.

VI. A STATE SPECIFIC DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY

For noninteracting determinantal states, the wave function is determined by the one-

particle density matrix. For closed shell determinantal states, we have ρ1[ρs], where this

functional includes all densities that are noninteracting v-representable, but it is also deﬁned

for all N-representable densities. So, using the constraint search approach [14, 15, 16, 17],

for a given density, say ρ′, the functional ρ1[ρ′] yields the one-particle density matrix that

minimizes the expectation value of the kinetic energy:

ρ1 → ρ′ hρ1| ˆT |ρ1i = hρ1[ρ′]| ˆT |ρ1[ρ′]i,
Min

(74)

where the search is over all determinantal states that have a density of ρ′.

Substituting ρ1[ρs] into Eco of Eq. (37) gives

Ev[ρ1] =

dr1

r2=r1 +

(cid:3)

+ EJ [ρs] + Ex[ρ] + Eco[ρ, v] +

dr v(r)˜ρc(r), (75)

where the last term is also a functional of v and ρs. This equation diﬀers from the Kohn–Shan

density functional, since the correlation-energy functional depends on the external potential

Z

13

v, and the last term does not appear in the Kohn–Sham approach. However, mathematically

speaking, the minimization of Eq. (75) follows the same procedure as in the Kohn–Sham

method, yielding

ˆf φw =

2 ∇2 + v + ˆvn

(cid:1)

Assuming the density n from the interacting state is noninteracting v-representable, we

have

Ev[n] = En, n is noninteracting v-representable.

(80)

Note that Eq. (75) is a valid energy functional only when the one-particle density matrix

that enters the ﬁrst term is the same one generated by the functional ρ1[ρs]; this is the case

when ρs is non-interacting v-representable.

APPENDIX A: A POSSIBLE CHOICE FOR gρC

The electron-electron repulsion operator is spin-free and can be written as

where the two-electron integral is written in chemist’s notation and the two-electron spin-

adapted excitation-operator is given by Eq. (8). This operator can also be written as

ˆVee =

ˆVee =

where the pair-function operator is given by

(77)

(78)

(79)

(A1)

(A2)

(A3)

and this operator yields the diagonal elements of the spinless two-particle density matrix.

Writing this operator in normal-ordered form [27, 39, 40, 41] with respect to the vacuum

state |ρ1i, we have

ˆVee =

where, examining each term in turn, from the ﬁrst term we have

ρ2(r2, r1)ρ1 =

ρs(r2)ρs(r1) −

ρ1(r2, r1)ρ1(r1, r2),

(A5)

Z Z

and this function is the diagonal element of the spinless second-order density matrix of the

determinantal state |ρ1i. From the second term, we have

ˆΓ(r)ρs =

χj(r)χ∗

i (r){ ˆEij}ρ1, ρ1 −→ ρs,

and this operator is the one-body portion of the density operator, where the density matrix

operator is given by

ij
X

ˆΓ(r)ρs = ˆΓ(r) − ρs(r),

(A6)

(A7)

(A8)

indicating that ˆΓ(r)ρs is determined by ρs and not by ρ1; two diﬀerent one-particle density
matrices that yield the same density have the same ˆΓ(r)ρs.

Returning to Eq. (A4), from the third term we have

ˆΓ(r1, r2)ρ1 =

χj(r1)χ∗

i (r2){ ˆEij}ρ1,

(A9)

ij
X

and this operator is the one-body portion of the one-particle density-matrix operator, given

by

ˆΓ(r1, r2) =

χj(r1)χ∗

i (r2) ˆEij = ρ1(r1, r2) + ˆΓ(r1, r2)ρ1.

(A10)

And from the last term, we have

ˆΓ2(r2, r1)ρ1 =

χj(r1)χ∗

i (r1)χl(r2)χ∗

k(r2){ ˆEijkl}ρ1,

(A11)

and this operator is the two-body portion of the pair-function operator, Eq. (A3).

To obtain a slight modiﬁcation of ˆVee, we replace the determinantal state density ρs, that

appears in Eq. (A4), with the exact density n, giving

ˆV ρ1

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

,

Replacing ˆVee by ˆV ρ1

ee within the Hamiltonian operator, we have obtain a trial Hamiltonian:

where λ is unity, but it can be permitted to be any constant value. Comparing this equation

with Eq. (26) yields Eq. (30).

APPENDIX B: ENERGY FUNCTIONAL USING INTERMEDIATE NORMAL-

IZATION

Using Eq. (26), our energy functional Ev, Eq. (21), can be also be written as

Ev[ρ1] =

h ˜Ψvρ1| ˆHvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i
h ˜Ψvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i

− λ

dr gρc(r)

Z

ˆΓ(r) − ρs(r)
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

.

By requiring our trial wave functions to satisfy intermediate normalization,

hρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i = 1,

we have

Ev[ρ1] = hρ1| ˆHvρ1| ˜Ψvρ1i − λ

dr gρc(r)

and this form suggest the following partitioning:

ˆΓ(r) − ρs(r)
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

,

ˆΓ(r) − ρs(r)
(cid:16)

,

Ev[ρ1] = E1[ρ1, v] + ˜Eco[ρ1, v] − λ

dr gρc(r)

(cid:17)
where ˜Eco is the correlation-energy (functional) of the trial wave function:

Z

˜Eco[ρ1, v] = hρ1| ˆHvρ1| ˜ΨQ

vρ1i,

Z

where the correlation function ˜ΨQ

vρ1 is deﬁned by

| ˜Ψvρ1i = |ρ1i + | ˜ΨQ

vρ1i.

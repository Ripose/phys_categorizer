ABSTRACT

For cutoﬀ potentials, a condition which is not a limitation for the calculation of physical
systems, the S-matrix is meromorphic. We can express it in terms of its poles, and
then calculate the quantum mechanical second virial coeﬃcient of a neutral gas.

Here, we take another look at this approach, and discuss the feasibility, attraction
and problems of the method. Among concerns are the rate of convergence of the ‘pole’
expansion and the physical signiﬁcance of the ‘higher’ poles.

Introduction

This work has had a long gestation. Our earliest notes date from July 1976! At that
time, two of us (M. Berrondo and S.Y. Larsen) obtained what we thought was an
attractive formula for the q.m.
second virial coeﬃcient in terms of the location of
its poles, as an alternative to its well known[1] and customary formulation in terms
of phase shifts and bound state energies. Soon after doing this work, and obtaining
some results, we were made aware that H. Nussenzveig had already published[2] an
attractive article on the same subject and we stopped our eﬀorts.

Recently, however, there has been interest in some other quarters[3], related to the
pole expansion of the S-matrix, and we thought that useful details of such expansions
might be properly be brought to light within the context of the statistical mechanics of
the virial. Together with other colleagues, we look at the rate of convergence for phase
shifts and for the virial. We look at asymptotic expansions for the poles. We try to
see whether we can use tricks to either accelerate the convergence or sum background
poles. We look at diﬀerent model potentials. In the case of hard spheres, we obtain an
expansion for the virial valid at low temperature.

2 The second virial in terms of the poles

For potentials decreasing faster than exponentials, like gaussian or cutoﬀ potentials
the Jost function is an entire function and, accordingly, the
matrix is meromorphic.
We can express it as a exponential together with a product of poles :

where a denotes the range of the potential and the kn,ℓ’s are the poles labelled in order
of increasing modulus. It should be noted that this expression, apart from the factor

In later calculations and formulations[6], a partial integration has often been per-
formed to yield the virial in terms of the phase shifts, themselves, and the bound state
energies. Also for convenience, we have divided the virial into two parts, a Boltzmann
plus an exchange part. We focus on the Boltzmann part, but can at any moment obtain
the exchange part by minor internal changes of sign and the inclusion of a perfect gas
term.

Since the

matrix, here, has a compact expression in terms of its poles the previous
equation also has such an expression. Indeed the derivative dδℓ/dk is nothing else than

3 The phase shifts in terms of poles

Clearly our procedure becomes more attractive if few poles are required to reproduce
the second virial to good accuracy. In this section, we examine how the expansion,
Eq.(4), reproduces the phase-shifts.

For a pure hard sphere potential, the answer is very pleasing: the number of poles

for the ℓthpartial wave equals ℓ.

−

−

For ℓ = 0, the phase shift of a hard sphere of radius σ is just

kσ and the poles
do not contribute. For the higher ℓ’s, we ﬁnd that our formula for the S-matrix works
1)ℓ is not needed. We note that asymptotically the
perfectly, but that the factor (
phases tend to

ℓπ/2.

kσ

−

Unfortunately, for the more common cutoﬀ potentials, the number of poles appear-
ing in the expansion is inﬁnite and, practically, to obtain the phase shift to, say 5
digits accuracy, the number of poles required is impressively large. We note, though,
that except for poles found on the imaginary axis, they occur in pairs, in the third
and fourth quadrant, and thus for these pairs, it is suﬃcient to determine the poles in
the last quadrant. For a potential made up of a (repulsive) hard core plus an attached
attractive square well, we ﬁnd the results presented in table 1.

This is for ℓ = 0, kσ = q = 0.1, the de Boer parameter Λ∗ = (h2/mV0σ2)1/2 equal
to 10, the hard core radius σ and ﬁnally a, the outer limit of the attractive potential,
equal to 2.85σ.

The expansion converges but so slowly that we are faced with the necessity of
increasing the rate of convergence of the series. We note that at the origin (k = 0),
the phase shift behaves like k2ℓ+1. Thus, for a given ℓ, derivatives up to 2ℓ are equal
to zero. We obtain:

For ℓ = 1, q = 0.1 and 23 pairs of poles, we obtain 1.478248 10−3 compared to the
exact result of 1.47826613 10−3 and, similarly, for ℓ = 2, 4.04298921 10−6 instead of
4.042988889 10−6 . The method, however, deteriorates as the energy increases.

To remedy the slow convergence for ℓ = 0, we introduce the derivative of the phase

shift (non zero) at k = 0 , i.e.

We then easily calculate the new term using trigonometric functions.

To prevent the deterioration as k increases, we limit the number of subtractions to
2. The results are then presented in table 2. Clearly, the number of poles required,
ℓ being ﬁxed, rises as the energy increases. On the other hand, at ﬁxed energy, the
number of poles needed is least when ℓ is largest.

4 Asymptotic formulas

The simplest way to remedy a lack (or a limited number) of poles is to determine an
asymptotic formula. Nussenzveig, in his book[4], derived such an asymptotic expres-
sion, which we extended to ‘handle ’ hard cores, but we need to increase its accuracy.
We begin by looking for an asymptotic formula for the s-wave, and then generalize
to higher angular momenta. The zeros of the Jost function F (k) are the poles of the
S-matrix F (

k)/F (k). They are given (see Appendix B) by solving the equation

We thus obtain some corrections to Nussenzveig’s leading term, which were calculated
from the equation:

To get the correct value we ﬁrst solve equation (16) by setting

we deﬁne A = 2π(a
in table 3. We see that we are able to reproduce the exact results, for the higher poles,
to 5 digits.

For waves with higher values of ℓ, we show, in Appendix C, that we can generalize the
approach of Appendix B, for example by setting the free Jost solution equal to

and proceeding in a manner similar to that used for ℓ = 0.

In table 4, we examine the quality of our approximations for values of ℓ not equal to
zero. Our results for ℓ = 1, 2 are of comparable quality to those that we found for the
l = 0. The key parameter is the ratio ℓ/k(a
σ). So long as it is small the asymptotic
results will be good. We see that for large ℓ’s, we have to proceed to a larger value of
n, before the behaviour of the poles becomes asymptotic.

Table 5. The hard sphere virial, from Eq.(29)

In Appendix D, we outline how we recover terms in a low temperature expansion

(σ/λT small), a number of which are found in BLK.

5.2 Hard sphere + square well

For Λ∗ = 4, the 2 particles have a bound state for ℓ = 0 and one for ℓ = 1. These
bound states then dominate the very low temperature behaviour of these partial virials
(i.e.
for these angular momenta), and therefore for these virials. This is due to the
large exponential terms that arise for large λT /σ. This already becomes evident for
λT /σ = 2, and becomes more important for λT /σ = 5, 10, 20, 30

Still, for λT /σ = 2, it is useful to see the virial calculated and displayed as function

Here it is well to comment on our reference BLK. The authors BLK published
results on hard spheres[6], many years ago, but not partial results for distinct values
of ℓ, nor results for a hard sphere + a square well. Here, by BLK, we mean that one
of the previous authors (SYL) is using some of the old programs and the old methods
to obtain results which can be used to benchmark the use of the poles. These results,
however, have not been obtained with the same need and desire for accuracy that the
old work required. The programs have now been used with machines with smaller word
lengths, the calculations done with larger meshes, etc. The values of the bound states
have also been obtained from our work with the poles.

for which there are no bound states. In table 7 we show, for ℓ = 0, the convergence of

5.3 Further comments on the poles

As we saw, if the discontinuity in the potential at the cut-oﬀ a is not zero, and also not
inﬁnite, then our asymptotic expansions, for the location of the poles which appear in
the expression of the S-matrix, show that the number of these poles is inﬁnite.

Alternatively, we can use an elegant argument, of Newton[7] and Nussenzveig[4],
which argues that the function G(k) = F (k)F (
k), involving the Jost function F (k), is
an entire function of the variable k2, of order 1/2, and therefore has an inﬁnite number
of zeroes, which then again leads to the conclusion that the S-matrix has an inﬁnite
number of poles. The basic element in both approaches is an analysis of the behaviour
of the function G(k) for large values of
.

−

k

As we can see directly, from our asymptotic expressions, the zeroes of F (k), for
, depend on the value of the potential at a, rather than on the
these large values of
values for r from 0 to a. Thus, as already noted by Nussenzveig, the resulting poles do
not have much physical signiﬁcance. He shows that a Yukawa-type potential yields a
branch cut, which if the potential is cut oﬀ, is replaced by an inﬁnite set of poles.

k

|

|

One further point. We can readily understand that some of the poles represent
bound states and resonances. In general, it is subtle to understand the physical sig-
niﬁcance of the poles. Nussenzveig dedicates a chapter in his book (Causality and
Dispersion Relations) to this purpose. We commend it to our readers.

|

6 Conclusion

We think that the development of a formalism for the second virial coeﬃcient, in terms
of the poles of the S-matrix, is an attractive one. It is a formalism equally as powerful

11

as the more conventional one, based on phase shifts and bound states, but, for example,
treats the phase shifts and bound state contributions in a uniﬁed way.

For hard spheres, the number of poles for each ℓ is ﬁnite and we see that, with a

handful of these poles, we can reproduce results obtained by previous methods.

For other more realistic potentials, and our hard sphere + square well, the number
of poles is inﬁnite and the phase shifts and the virial converge slowly in terms of the
poles. We have, however, been able to devise tricks to accelerate this convergence. We
have also perfected and extended the use of asymptotic expressions for the location of
the poles. The result is that we can still obtain (and have obtained) results with a
modest (non forbidding) number of poles.

These days, with the abundance of numerical power available, and the new methods
that have been developed to locate poles[3] for realistic potentials, we are freer to choose
the methods that we might use for virial calculations.

Appendix B

Here, we derive an asymptotic expression for the location of the poles of the
matrix,or,
equivalently of the zeros of the Jost function (the zeros of the Jost function F (k) are
k)/F (k)). We solve a Volterra equation, which generates
the poles of the S-matrix F (
the Jost solution fℓ(k, r) and, then, the Jost function. The latter Fℓ(k) = fℓ(k, σ)
for a potential which includes a hard core and Fℓ(k) = limr→0(

If one approximates the function g(k, r) by the sum s(k, r) = g0 + g1 + g2 + g3, the
Jost function is approximated by s(k, 0), for a potential which is ﬁnite at the origin,

Abstract

At room temperature and under ambient conditions, due to the adsorption, a water ﬁlm is

always present on silica surfaces. If the surface is investigated with a scanning probe method in

Contact mode, this causes the formation of a meniscus between the tip and the surface. This liquid

neck generates additional capillary forces between the nano-tip and the surface. In dynamic mode,

due to the action of the oscillating tip on the surface, the mechanical response of the adsorbed

water layers can induce additional dissipation that is probed through the phase variations of the

oscillator. In the present work, we analyze by dynamic force microscopy the growth of a water ﬁlm
on a silica surface as a function of time. The silica sample is ﬁrst cleaned and heated at 420◦C, then

is exposed to dry conditions. The inﬂuence of the water ﬁlm is checked with the dynamic mode by

using intermittent contact and noncontact situations. To describe the experimental observations,

additional dissipation is taken into account when the tip approaches the surface. The results of the

ﬁts allow the evaluation of the dissipation induced by the attractive interaction between the tip

and the silica surface related to the adsorption of water molecules on surface as a function of time.

Results are compared to previous tribological studies performed in Contact mode and infra-red

spectroscopy measurements on the silica for which the key parameter was the surface temperature

instead of time. The two experimental results are in good agreement.

INTRODUCTION

During the last decade, Dynamic Force Microscopy (DFM) used in the Tapping mode has

been found as a suitable tool to investigate surfaces morphology and mechanical properties of

soft materials. The technics has been widely used to investigate a wide range of samples in-

cluding polymers1,2, biological materials3,4 or organic layers5,6. Taking advantage of the sen-

sitivity of the oscillating tip-cantilever system (OTCL) at the proximity of the surface, vari-

ous physical properties can be investigated including mechanical properties7,8,9,10, adhesion11,

forces mapping12,13,14 and dissipation processes15,16,17,18,19,20. As a complementary approach,

experiments performed in Contact mode were widely used to probe chemical treatments of

surfaces and evolution of surface properties. Therefore, numerous works were dedicated to

investigate adhesion and friction variations as a function of changes of the surface properties

under various conditions : humidity rate, vacuum or controlled atmosphere21,22,23.

Because DFM is a very sensitive tool probing forces is noncontact and intermittent contact

situations, it is a suitable approach to investigate local properties without inducing severe

damage on the surface. In particular, liquid layers and the inﬂuence of capillary forces have

been extensively investigated24,25. The presence of a liquid layer from molecular thickness up

to a few nanometers can signiﬁcantly modify the behavior of the OTCL. In ref.25, M.Luna

et al. discuss the inﬂuence of the conservative and non conservative forces due to the water

adsorption onto various surfaces on the variation of the resonance frequency and quality

factor of the OTCL.

In the present work, we use DFM to investigate the growth of a water ﬁlm on a silica

surface at room temperature as a function of the exposure time. To do so, we use recent

theoretical developments describing the inﬂuence of the noncontact dissipation (NC dissipa-

tion) on the observed phase delay during a Tapping experiment20,26,27,28,29. The silica surface
is ﬁrst cleaned and heated under oxygen ﬂow at 420 ◦C during 90 minutes. Then, it is put

into a glove box under controlled atmosphere assuming that the water covering goes along.

Evolution of the surface is measured by recording approach-retract curves versus time that

give the variations of the oscillation amplitude and phase as a function of the tip-surface

distance.

In the ﬁrst part of the paper, we brieﬂy recall the model used to take into account

the surface modiﬁcations and NC dissipation processes. The second part is devoted to

2

experimental results obtained with the cleaned and heated silica surface and a comparison

with the theoretical developments. The experimental results are compared to those obtained

with a previous tribological study performed in Contact mode as a function of the sample

temperature. The last part of the paper is a discussion of the results obtained.

II. MODELING THE OTCL’S BEHAVIOR

The present section gives a synthesis of the theoretical developments allowing analyti-

cal expressions of the nonlinear equations of motion of the OTCL –amplitude and phase

variations as a function of the distance between the tip and the surface– to be obtained in

order to ﬁt the experimental data. The aim of these equations is to reproduce the observed

approach-retract curves and more particularly the increase of the phase delay due to the

attractive interaction between the tip and the surface. By using a sphere-plane geometry

with an attractive Van der Waals interaction30 describing the interaction between the tip

and the surface :

the OTCL far from the surface, respectively. Q is the quality factor of the OTCL given by
Q = ω0/β0. β0 is the OTCL damping coeﬃcient in air. κa = HR/ (kcA3

0) is a dimensionless

parameter which is characteristic of the nonlinear coupling with kc, the cantilever’ stiﬀness.
Thus, varying κa with A0 is equivalent to vary the strength of the attractive interaction13.

In order to ﬁt the experimental data, e.g. amplitude and phase variations as a function

of the distance between the tip and the surface, it was shown that the introduction of an

additional dissipation when the tip does not touch the surface was a necessary requirement

that explained the increase of the phase delay20,27. The additional dissipation is modeled

as being the consequence of the OTCL energy loss due to the mechanical response of the

substrate induced by the attractive interaction with the tip20,26,27,28,29. The substrate is

modeled as a viscoelastic, thus described by its local stiﬀness ks and damping coeﬃcient γs

with a relaxation time τs = γs/ks. These works give a detailed explanation of the origin

of an additional damping coeﬃcient βint. Depending on the value of τs with regard to the

characteristic times of the OTCL –its oscillation period T and the residence time of the tip at

the proximity of the surface, τres– two asymptotic regimes of dissipation can be deduced. τres

is the residence time of the tip in the vicinity of the surface, e.g. when the coupling between
the OTCL and the surface is large and is given by τres ≃
Depending on the values of τs (see ﬁg.1), two asymptotic behaviors are calculated. Results

with K = HR/6. Thus the NC dissipation processes are controlled by the strength of the
attractive interaction through a square dependence with the term (HR)2. The limit of short
relaxation times is τs →
local deformation of the surface follows the action of the oscillating tip without any phase

0 for which the sample behavior is elastic-like. In that case, the

delay (see ﬁg.1). As a consequence, the dissipated energy goes to zero. For long relaxation

times, the mechanical susceptibility of the sample scales as 1/γs, then also the additional

dissipated energy.

The total damping coeﬃcient of the OTCL can be written as an equivalent damping

Equ.7 is the one that is used to ﬁt the experimental phase variations.

The variation of the amplitude without including an additional dissipation is straight-

forwardly obtained from equ.3. In accordance with the known result that the dissipation

reduces the nonlinear eﬀects31,32, a ﬁrst consequence is a drastic reduction of the size of

the hysteresis loop20. When the OTCL approaches the surface, the amplitude variations

are similar. The main diﬀerence appears at the bifurcation spot where the magnitude of

the amplitude jump is slightly frustrated. We have shown that equ.3 was of some help to

estimate the value of the HR product20.

III. RESULTS

A. Experimental conditions

Dynamical mode : The silica substrate is cleaned as detailed elsewhere33 and heated
under oxygen ﬂow at 420 ◦C during 90 minutes in order to remove the water layers and

contaminants. Then the sample is put into a glove box under nitrogen controlled atmosphere

with one ppm (part per million) of water and oxygen and at room temperature. Experiments

of approach-retract curves were performed with a Nanoscope III34 operating in Tapping mode

into the glove box. In such conditions, the cantilever behavior is very stable. A commercial

silicon tip-cantilever TESP-NCL-W from Nanosensors35 is used, with an announced stiﬀness
of about 40 N.m−1, a measured resonance frequency of 185130 Hz and a quality factor of

500. Particular attention was focussed on the quality of the OTCL whose behavior has to be

harmonic for quantitative measurements. Technical remarks concerning the determination

of the cantilever parameters and data treatments are detailed in ref.13. The experiments
45◦ and an oscillation
were performed at 184944 Hz, corresponding to a phase ϕf ree ≃ −

5

amplitude Af ree = A0/√2

0.707A0 for large tip-surface distances. The subscript “free”

≃

means that the oscillation conditions are measured at a tip-surface distance for which the

tip does not interact with the surface, typically distances of ten nanometers or more.

To investigate the inﬂuence of water layers, all the experiments presented in this paper

were performed with the same cantilever over three days. Over those three days, no no-

ticeable variation of the OTCL parameters (resonance frequency and quality factor) was

observed.

Contact mode : Nanotribological measurements are detailed in a previous paper36.

Here, we brieﬂy recall the experimental conditions and present a synthetic result which will

then be compared to DFM results (see discussion). The silica substrate is also cleaned
and heated at 420 ◦C under oxygen ﬂow, then exposed to dry conditions. All experiments

were performed in a glove box under dry conditions with nitrogen ﬂow. This condition is

necessary since experiments performed in air (under uncontrolled humidity rate) were not

as much reproducible to extract a signiﬁcant variation of the adhesion and friction as a

function of the temperature. Force curves and friction loops were recorded at temperature
varying between 25 ◦C and 170 ◦C36.

B. Results obtained in Tapping mode

1. Noncontact situations : evaluation of the HR product

When the sample is taken out of the furnace, corresponding to the reference time –

set time zero–, approach-retract curves are recorded every two or three hours, three days

long. During the approach-retract curve, when the bistable behavior occurs, the tip is at

a vertical location far enough from the surface, in the range of one nanometer or more, to

reduce the contribution of the NC dissipation. As a consequence, one can estimate that the

bifurcation is only controlled by HR/kc and A0 through the κa dependence. Nevertheless,
1/A9 (see also the A dependence

note that the strength of the attractive force scaling as

in τres), a too low value of the amplitude can not be used to perform the ﬁts. Therefore,

p

the curves for which the noncontact (NC) situations occur allow to get an evaluation of the

HR/kc product from equ.3. For this set of experiments, the amplitude at which the ﬁrst

NC situation happens is Af ree = 19 nm (A0 = 27 nm). To simplify the analysis and use the

6

ﬁt of the experimental NC curves, a typical value of the amplitude used is Af ree = 12.5 nm

(A0 = 18 nm). The experimental measurements are then compared at diﬀerent times.

In ﬁg.2 are reported comparisons between experimental and theoretical curves for dif-

ferent amplitudes and diﬀerent times. The equ.3 used to ﬁt the experimental data gives a

reasonable agreement. The average value of the coeﬃcient HR/kc extracted from the ﬁts
18.10−27 J.m. Taking
is 0.46.10−27 m3. Thus, by taking kc ≃
into account the fact that the very ﬁrst NC situation is obtained for Af ree = 19 nm, it’s

40 N.m−1, we get HR

≃

expected that the radius of the tip is not very small since we usually observe NC situations
on the silica for Af ree ≃
a consequence, we get for the silica H

20 nm. As
10−19 J. This evaluation is in agreement with a

10 nm, or less13. Thus in that case, let’s consider R

≃

previous result (see below).

≃

The ﬁts do not provide an accurate quantitative value of HR but allow to evaluate the

variation of the strength of the attractive interaction between the tip and the surface as a

function of time. The result of the ﬁts obtained at diﬀerent times for Af ree = 12.5 nm are

given in ﬁg.3. Any variation of the value of HR/kc is noticed three days long. Since the

radius of the tip and the cantilever stiﬀness are constant parameters, a constant value of

HR/kc means that the Hamaker constant remains nearly the same. Therefore, whatever

the evolution of the silica surface during those three days, this evolution does not lead to a

noticeable variation of the attractive interaction between the tip and the surface.

The same method was used to compare the attractive interaction between a tip and a

silica surface and the same tip and a grafted silica surface. From the ﬁts, it was deduced that
11.5.10−27 J.m20. While it is diﬃcult to
(HR)silica ≃
evaluate the error on the H values, the use of equ.3 appears quite helpful either to compare

5.10−27 J.m and (HR)graf ted silica ≃

two diﬀerent surfaces or to evaluate the relative evolution of the surface properties for a

given tip.

2.

Intermittent contact situations : evolution of the phase delay

As detailed in refs.20,29, in Tapping mode it is more convenient to use intermittent con-

tact (IC) situations to evaluate the contribution of the NC dissipation on the phase delay.

The main reason is that one needs to use an average distance between the tip and the

surface,∆ , that gives an order of magnitude of the strength of the attractive interaction

7

HR/ (6∆2). To simplify our evaluation, we consider a ﬁxed value of
HR/
∆, typically ∆ = ¯∆ = 0.5 nm. These assumptions are easily achieved with a large oscillation

amplitude. Note that for IC situations, ∆ = D
and therefore ¯∆

−

≪

A. Thus, while for pure NC situations one has two varying parameters,

A is less than the percent of the amplitude

the closest distance ∆ and the oscillation amplitude A, for IC situations a ﬁxed value of
the closest distance ¯∆ appears as a reasonable working assumption to evaluate the average

contribution of the attractive interaction.

Experimental phase variations at diﬀerent times and the theoretical curves obtained from
A−5/2, equ.5) are shown in ﬁg.4. The phase jump

equ.7 with the large values of τs (βint ∝
increases as a function of time. This is predicted to be the consequence of an increase of

the NC dissipation20 (see also discussion). The phase variations are ﬁtted as a function of

the observed variations of the oscillation amplitude. There is only one varying parameter
which is 1/γs, the others parameters being evaluated (HR), or estimated (kc, ¯∆). All the
theoretical curves are obtained with the power law A−5/2. Fits performed with the other
asymptotic regime, short relaxation times, with a power law A−3/2 (equ.4) can be separated

unambiguously, as shown with ﬁg.5.

IV. DISCUSSION

The mechanical susceptibility 1/γs extracted from the ﬁts exhibits a marked evolution

versus time (ﬁg.6). Since the ﬁts of the HR product lead to a constant value (ﬁg.3), this

result indicates a decrease of the surface damping coeﬃcient. It is noteworthy recalling that

the amount of NC dissipated energy corresponds to the ability of the surface to exhibit

a viscoelastic displacement induced by the attractive interaction. Therefore for surface

relaxation times larger than that of the oscillation period, when γs decreases, a surface

displacement proportional to 1/γs leads to an increase of the NC dissipated energy. This is

what is straightforwardly observed with the increase of the phase jumps of the curves with

time (ﬁg.4).

Such a variation of γs indicates an evolution of the surface structure and properties as

a function of time. Just after the heating process, only a few water molecules, if any,

cover the surface and are tightly bounded to the silica. In that case, the water layer might

be considered as an amorphous layer with long relaxation times corresponding to a high

8

damping coeﬃcient. The mechanical susceptibility of these molecules is weak so that the

surface is weakly perturbed by the tip-surface attractive interaction. When the sample is

exposed, even in a dry atmosphere, water molecules are more and more adsorbed on the

surface, leading to a more ﬂuid-like behavior of the surface with a higher molecular mobility

and, in turn, a shorter relaxation time. Nevertheless, as shown with ﬁg.5, the use of the

short relaxation times model doesn’t provide a good agreement with the observed phase

variations. Even 90 hours after the beginning of the experiments, it’s still possible to ﬁt

the experimental data with the long time model (ﬁg.4, diamonds symbols). In ref.20, the

experimental phase variations on the silica could not be ﬁtted with the long times model,

but only with the short times one. But in that case, no thermal treatment of the silica

had been used and the surface was placed into the glove box for many days. From these

results, one can deduce that the quantity of water layers on this latter surface should be

larger than the one on the thermally treated surface, even 90 hours after the beginning of

the experiments.

While equs.4 or 5 aim at describing pure NC situations, questions rise about the origin

of the information which is measured within Tapping experiments. As explained above, in

Tapping mode, one has two varying parameters to ﬁt the experimental variations : A and

∆. A varying during the approach-retract curves, ∆ too. This leads to complex situations if

one wants to extract NC dissipation parameters from the pure NC situations. This is mainly
the reason why, IC situations are used, ∆ being ﬁxed to an average value, ¯∆, of about a
few angstroms. But as a consequence, ¯∆ might be as well ﬁxed to the so-called contact
distance30, dc ≃
0.165 nm, thus changing the magnitude of γs. For instance, by choosing
¯∆ = 0.25 nm instead of ¯∆ = 0.5 nm, the value of γs obtained would be 11 times larger
because of the ¯∆−7/2 dependence in equ.5. This makes absolute quantitative measurements

diﬃcult to achieve. As a consequence, the magnitude of γs reported in ﬁg.6 is only indicative

since it could has been one order of magnitude larger.

The DFM results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from Contact mode and

FTIR spectroscopy36. In these experiments, we had focused on the inﬂuence of capillary

eﬀects due to the presence of water layers on the nanotribological properties as a function of

the sample temperature. The variations of the pull oﬀ force and of the frictions forces were

reasonably well explained by assuming the creation of a water meniscus between the tip

9

and the surface. When the tip is pulled oﬀ the surface (adhesion force) or moved laterally

(tangential force or friction), a gap is created between the tip and the silica surface and is

ﬁlled with a liquid phase. The AFM measurements show a net decrease of the measured

forces as the temperature increases. As an example, the decrease of the pull oﬀ force as a
function of the temperature is shown in ﬁg.7. The abrupt decrease observed around 100◦C

suggests that capillary forces provide a major contribution to the pull oﬀ and tangential

forces at room temperature.

The nature of the water layer on silica versus temperature was also analyzed by FTIR

spectroscopy and correlated to the water layers morphology. A qualitative analysis of the

spectrums obtained gives two kinds of water layers : liquid layers, which are removed above
100◦C and strongly adsorbed water molecules with a solid-like behavior that still remain at
150◦C and under vacuum. In this latter case, the water layers become more structured due to

the proximity of the substrate. For the liquid structure, we assume a molecular mobility that

is weakly dependent on the thickness of the water ﬁlm. When the temperature increases,

the decrease of these forces is related to a structural modiﬁcation of the water layers.

The comparison between the evolution of the damping coeﬃcient as a function of time

deduced from the Tapping experiments (ﬁg.6) and the one of the normalized pull oﬀ force

(ﬁg.7) as a function of the temperature, suggests that the ﬁrst Tapping measurement per-
formed at time zero corresponds to the data measured at 120◦C with the Contact mode

(arrow 1 on both ﬁgures). Thus we can deduce an equivalence between time exposure of the

sample to dry conditions and temperature of the sample. The covering of the silica going on

with time, e.g. the quantity of the water molecules adsorbed on the surface increasing, the

damping coeﬃcient decrease can be interpreted as a decrease of the equivalent temperature

of the sample (from arrow 1 to 2 on ﬁg.6 and from 2 to 1 on ﬁg.7).

V. CONCLUSION

Dynamic Force Microscopy experiments were performed to investigate the growth of wa-

ter layers on a silica surface exposed to a rather dry atmosphere as a function of time.

10

Noncontact dissipation due to the attractive interaction between the tip and the surface

is included in the theoretical developments. This allows to describe the evolution of the

OTCL phase as a function of time that corresponds to changes of the water layers structure.

The equations obtained from the model are able to reproduce with a good agreement the

experimental observations. These variations can only be reproduced from the model taking

into account rather long relaxation times. The damping coeﬃcient deduced shows a marked

decrease as a function of time. As a consequence, the evolution of the mechanical suscepti-

bility of the silica surface indicates the contamination of the surface with water molecules

as a function of time.

These DFM observations are in good agreement with previous tribological and infra-red

measurements for which the contamination of a silica surface with water molecules was

investigated as a function of the sample temperature.

FIG. 1: Sketch of the action of the oscillating tip on the sample. The viscoelastic behavior of the

surface (γs, ks) implying that it can be deformed under the action of the tip-surface attractive

force. Depending on the value of its relaxation time τs = γs/ks with regard to the period T and

the residence time τres (long, τs ≫

FIG. 2: Experimental noncontact amplitude variations (open black symbols) versus tip-surface

distance for Af ree = 12.5 nm (A0 = 18 nm) as a function of time and their comparisons with

theoretical curves deduced from equ.3 (continuous grey lines). The theoretical curves are calculated

in order to ﬁt the location of the bifurcation, thus giving an evaluation of HR/kc. The general

experimental parameters are given in the text. Circles, time = 0.7 hours; squares, time = 7 hours;

diamonds, time = 30 hours; triangles, time = 76 hours. The horizontal locations of the curves

have been arbitrarily shifted in order to show all the variations.

FIG. 3: Values of HR/kc deduced from the ﬁts of the experimental amplitudes variations as a

function of time. The ﬁts were performed on the curves obtained for Af ree = 12.5 nm (see ﬁg.2).
HR/kc doesn’t evolve with time and the average value is 0.46.10−27 m3. Since R and kc are

constant parameters, a constant value of HR/kc means that the Hamaker constant remains nearly

the same, H

10−19 J (see text).

FIG. 4: Experimental intermittent contact phase variations (open black symbols) versus tip-surface

distance as a function of time and their comparisons with theoretical curves (continuous grey lines)

deduced from equ.7. The curves were obtained with Af ree = 36 nm (A0 = 51 nm). The other

parameters are : circles, time = 7 hours; triangles, time = 21 hours; diamonds, time = 90 hours.

The increase of the phase jump as a function of time is characteristic of an increase of the dissipated

energy.

FIG. 5: Experimental phase variation (open black circles) versus tip-surface distance and its com-
parison with theoretical curves deduced from the long relaxation times model, A−5/2 equ.5 (con-
tinous grey line) and the short relaxation times model, A−3/2 equ.4 (continuous black line). The

experimental parameters are Af ree = 36 nm (A0 = 51 nm) and time = 7 hours.

FIG. 6: Evolution of the γs parameter with time deduced from the ﬁts of the experimental phase

variations with the long relaxation times model. The values of γs depend on the evaluation of HR

and ¯∆ (see text). The net decrease observed, corresponding to an increase of the NC dissipation,

is the consequence of the increase of the quantity of water molecules adsorbed on the silica surface

with time. The arrows 1 and 2 indicate the time-temperature equivalence that can be extracted

by comparing the Tapping mode and Contact mode experiments (see text). For instance, arrow
1 indicates a structure of the water layer corresponding to a temperature above 100◦C, whereas

arrow 2 corresponds to a structure of the water layers observed at room temperature (see ﬁg.7).

FIG. 7: Evolution of the normalized pull oﬀ force as a function of the silica sample temperature

deduced from Contact mode experiments36. The normalization pull oﬀ force is 82 nN. The black

line is a guide line for eyes. The arrows 1 and 2 indicate the time-temperature equivalence that

can be extracted by comparing the Tapping mode and Contact mode experiments (see text and

ﬁg.6).

Considerable insights can be obtained regarding the nature of highly excited states by computing
the eigenbasis expectation values of the resonance operators associated with an eﬀective spectro-
scopic Hamiltonian. The expectation values are related to the parametric derivative of the eigenval-
ues with respect to speciﬁc resonance strengths i.e., level velocities. Sensitivity of the level velocities
to the existence of closed orbits in the underlying classical phase space provides for a dimensionality
independent route to a dynamical assignment of the states. In this letter, taking CHBrClF (polyad
P = 5) and the [16, 0]g+ bend polyad of C2H2 as examples, we show that the level velocities can
signal the birth of new modes and highlight sequences of localized eigenstates.

INTRODUCTION

Dynamical assignment of the highly excited eigenstates
of a polyatomic molecule is a topic of signiﬁcant interest
to the chemical physics community[1, 2, 3, 4]. Insights
into the nature of the excited states provides for a bet-
ter understanding of the phenomenon of intramolecular
vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) occuring in the
molecule[1, 3, 4]. Assignment of the low energy vibra-
tional states in terms of the usual normal mode quantum
numbers is relatively straightforward. However with in-
creasing energies the normal mode quantum numbers are
no longer conserved due to perturbations that strongly
mix the zeroth order modes and the molecular vibrational
Hamiltonian[4] takes the form:

The above Hamiltonian is usually generated from a ﬁt to

initio potential energy surface. Even in the case when an
accurate potential energy surface is at hand it is possible,
and useful, to generate a Hamiltonian of the above form
using the canonical Van-Vleck perturbation theory[5, 6].
The advantages of using Hamiltonians of the above form
stems from the fact that the classical limit Hamiltonian

bility or locking between the unperturbed frequencies
∂H0(I)/∂I. Such resonances are responsible for
Ω(I)
energy ﬂow through the molecule and lead to breakdown
of the zeroth order, low energy quantum numbers. Clas-
sical dynamics of resonant Hamiltonians is historically
very rich and have been studied in great detail[7].
In
particular a detailed understanding of the classical dy-
namics of H(I, θ) is essential for any dynamical assign-
ment of the quantum eigenstates of
H. Furthermore the
eﬀective Hamiltonian approach utilizes the state space
perspective which oﬀers considerable advantages towards
understanding IVR[4].

Clearly any assignment of the eigenstates of

H for-
mally requires the existence of a suﬃciently large set of
good quantum numbers. Such a set does not exist in
general and hence assignment implies the existence of at
least approximate or quasi quantum numbers. By neces-
sity such approximate quantum numbers are conserved
for a certain time period dictated by the dynamics of the
system. Support for the notion of quasi quantum num-
bers partially comes from the experimental observation[4]
of hierarchical IVR in molecules and the fact that most
molecules are not ergodic even at fairly high energies[8].
In this sense deciphering the quantum numbers, exact
or approximate, invariably implies the knowledge of the
underlying dynamics. Consequently one speaks of a dy-
namical assignment of the eigenstates wherein some or
all of the quantum numbers arise by focusing on impor-
tant quantum and or classical dynamical structures. A
consistent picture that is emerging from many studies
is that the complicated spectral splittings and patterns
at high energies can be ‘unzipped’ to some extent using
the underlying classical dynamics. More speciﬁcally, the
spectra are unzipped by recognizing eigenstates showing
similar localization characteristics about important clas-
sical invariant structures in the underlying phase space.
Studies based on classical-quantum correspondence
have been successfully applied to systems with two cou-
pled modes[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] but are yet to be
extended to systems with three or more coupled modes

i.e., multimode systems[17]. The technical and concep-
tual diﬃculties associated with a straightforward general-
ization of the two mode techniques to multimode systems
are well understood[15]. Circumventing the technical dif-
ﬁculty, in our opinion, requires utilizing quantum objects
which are sensitive to the underlying classical mechanics
but do not rely on visualizing the phase space and eigen-
states. Considerable work has been done in this direc-
tion and a common theme underlying such approaches is
the analysis of the eigenvalues and their variation with
Hamiltonian parameters[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. For in-
stance the nature of an eigenstate
H has been
studied using the methods of diabatic correlations[19, 20]
revealing the existence of formal quantum numbers. The
basic quantity in these studies is the variation of the
eigenvalue Eα with a speciﬁc coupling strength i.e.,
∂Eα/∂τk. Remarkable correlation of the level variations
to the phase space nature of the eigenstates had been
noted by Weissman and Jortner in the context of the
Henon-Heiles system[24]. Support for the correlation was
provided recently[25] from a semiclassical viewpoint and
it was suggested that the parametric variations were sen-
sitive to the various bifurcations occuring in the classical
phase space. However strong support for the observed
correlations have existed[26] in the literature in terms of
the classical-quantum correspondence of quantum expec-
tation values i.e., diagonal matrix elements.

ρk has a smooth and oscillating part with the smooth
part being independent of the nature of the classical dy-
namics. The oscillating part is sensitive to the nature
of the dynamics and can be written down in terms of
a sum over the closed orbits in the phase space. If the
phase space is chaotic then the closed orbits are the vari-
ous periodic orbits whereas for a regular phase space the
closed orbits are the rational tori. In either case it can be
shown[26] that the oscillating part depends inversely on
the determinant of the stability matrix M of the closed
orbit and directly on the quantity

We emphasise the dependence of ρk on the quantities

scores the important role played by the classical analog
Vk. Further, performing a standard canonical trans-

Recent work from our group has demonstrated the
usefulness of the above method for understanding the
highly excited states of a model system[25] and the DCO
radical[16]. In this letter two molecules, CHBrClF and
C2H2, are chosen as further examples to illustrate the
method. Speciﬁcally, the N = 5 polyad of CHBrClF and
the [16, 0]g+ bending polyad of C2H2 are investigated.
In section II the highly excited states of CHBrClF are
analyzed and compared to a recent work[13]. We ﬁnd
some discrepancy in the dynamical assignments provided
earlier and by the level velocity method. In section III
the pure bending states of C2H2 are investigated and it
is shown that the level velocity approach is capable of
identifying the new class of local bending and counter-
rotation states. Comparing to a recent work[29] we show
that the level velocity approach is successful in identify-
ing important eigenstate sequences at such high levels of
excitation. Section IV concludes.

II. DYNAMICAL NATURE OF CHBRCLF
EIGENSTATES IN POLYAD N = 5

An eﬀective Hamiltonian for CHBrClF was proposed
by Beil et al. on the basis of their detailed study of
the rovibrational spectra[28]. The CH overtone spectrum
implicated multiple Fermi resonances involving the pure
CH stretch (s) and the two (a, b) CH bending vibrations.
The spectroscopic Hamiltonian has the form:

with the νj and xjk being the harmonic frequencies and
anharmonicities of the three modes respectively. The
perturbations
V are oﬀ-diagonal in the (vs, va, vb) ba-
sis and represent resonant coupling of the modes. The
ﬁrst three perturbation terms in the Hamiltonian are
Fermi resonances between the CH stretch and the various
bend modes whereas the last perturbation is a Darling-
Dennison resonance between the two bend modes. The
structure of the eﬀective Hamiltonian implies the exis-
tence of a constant of the motion N = vs + (va + vb)/2
called as the polyad number. For the various param-
eter values and form of the resonant operators we re-
fer the reader to the earlier works[13, 28]. However, we
note that the bending mode anharmonicities xaa, xbb, xab
are small and the resonant coupling strengths are rather
6 cm−1 and the stretching
large. For instance, xaa ∼ −
65 cm−1 whereas ksbb ∼

energy state it is clear that the sbb-Fermi resonance plays
an important role. This is evident from the IPR infor-
mation as well since the sbb single resonance basis values
are fairly high for the range of N shown. On the other
hand the highest energy states show the importance of

states to be regular and highly localized.

are shown for the eigenstates
in N = 5. Note that a large
implies a localized
state in the corresponding state space resonance zone and
also in the phase space about a closed orbit. The nature
of the closed orbit i.e., stable or unstable is inferred from
the sign of V αα
. A look at the partial expectation val-
ues V αα
(Pk) will reveal a single dominant contribution
leading to the assignment (N, Pk, ν) with ν denoting an
excitation index for states with the same Pk. We will
not give a list of assignments for the states in N = 5 but
rather focus on certain eigenstate sequences in order to
compare to a recent work[12]. At ﬁrst glance it is appar-
ent that the sbb resonance is inﬂuencing the lower end of
the polyad whereas the saa resonance is important for the
higher energy states. Note, however, that with increasing
energy the saa rapidly gains signiﬁcance with concomi-
tant decrease in the sbb inﬂuence. From Fig. 2 it is seen
that around 12020 cm−1
and the sequence
Vsaai ≈ h
h
splits into two branches. This indicates a change in the
underlying phase space and thus localization nature of
the eigenstates on the two branches should be diﬀerent.
This is supported by examining the phase space and the
alternating assignments provided in a recent work[13].
At the same time towards the middle of the polyad the
Darling-Dennison resonance is playing a key role in orga-
versus the energy
nizing the eigenstates. We plot the
eigenvalues Eα since this immediately reveals the states
that are possibly involved in avoided crossings. In Fig. 2
certain sequences have been shown and labeled according
to a classiﬁcation done recently. In this classiﬁcation[13]
B represent nonresonant states, and C represent states
inﬂuenced by the Darling-Dennison resonance. From the
expectation values, however, it is not apparent that the
ﬁrst few states are nonresonant. Indeed our analysis sug-
gests some of these states, for instance the ﬁrst three
states, are inﬂuenced by the sbb Fermi resonance. That
this is indeed the case has been conﬁrmed by the method
of local frequency analysis which shows extensive sbb
locking. In addition the corresponding IPRs in the sin-
gle sbb resonance basis are very high suggesting strong
inﬂuence by the resonance. Thus state number one is
2vs + vb = 10, va = 0) rather
assigned as (N = 5, Psbb ≡
than the earlier assignment of (N = 5, va = 0, vb = 10).
The earlier assignment[13] of Darling-Dennison states
essentially agrees with our results. Certain strongly lo-
calized sequence of C states is immediately revealed by
the expectation values as evident from Fig. 2.
It is
expected that such states are localized about the sta-
ble periodic orbit associated with the
Vaabb which has
been conﬁrmed by computing the Husimi distribuion
functions. Our assignment for the state denoted C50 is

The so called transverse quantum number nt is associ-
ated with the degree of excitation ν for a given Paabb.
In the nt = 0 sequence it is clear from the ﬁgure that
with increasing energy other resonances are coming into
eﬀect. The state labeled C20, in particular, is strongly
inﬂuenced by both the saa and the sbb Fermi resonances
and hence it is inappropriate to classify them as Darling-
Dennison states. The sequence corresponding to nt = 1
is strongly perturbed by the saa Fermi resonance.

Finally state number 16 and 30 have been classiﬁed in
the previous work as “chaotic” states (class D) exhibiting
a mixture of class B and class C states. The present anal-
ysis supports the above classiﬁcation for state 16, which
incidentally has the lowest IPR among all the states, but
clearly Fig. 2 suggests state 30 to be diﬀerent. The large
expectation values of saa with smaller sbb expectation

values indicates this state to be inﬂuenced by the saa and
sbb resonances. This state can be nominally assigned as
2vs + va = 8, vb = 2). Similarly state
(N = 5, Psaa ≡
number 33 was classiﬁed as E(D) suggesting dominant
saa character. However state space, expectation values
(cf. Fig. 2) and the various IPRs (integrable single sbb
resonance basis IPR is about 0.7) point to a state with
sbb character.

III. NATURE OF THE HIGHLY EXCITED
BEND STATES IN C2H2

The pure bending dynamics of acetylene at about
10000 cm−1 above ground state is known to be quite
complicated due to the strong interaction between the
trans and the cis bending normal modes[11]. However
recent work by Jung, Taylor and Jacobson revealed that
the highly excited bending eigenstates were assignable
despite strong chaos in the system[29]. The key to their
dynamical assignments was the fact that a few periodic
orbits were organizing the dynamics at such high energies
and hence inﬂuencing the structure of the eigenstates.
Many sequences of eigenstates exhibiting similar local-
ization patterns about the periodic orbits were identi-
ﬁed leading to the unzipping of the spectrum. The pur-
pose of this section is to show that parametric variations
can immediately reveal the existence of such progressions
without the need for the visualization of the phase space
and/or the eigenstates.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian appropriate for the study
of the bend only dynamics up to 15000 cm−1 with an
H anh +
accuracy of 1.5 cm−1 has the form[30]
H lin = ω4ˆv4 + ω5ˆv5 and the

VDDI is a Darling-Dennison resonance leading to ex-
change of quanta between the two modes at constant l4

to exchange of vibrational angular momentum only be-
tween the two modes.
VDDII results in both exchange
of quanta and vibrational angular momentum between
the two modes. For the ﬁtted parameter values and form
of the perturbation operators we refer the reader to the
previous works[29, 30]. Due to the nature of the resonant
couplings there are two conserved quantum numbers or
polyads denoted by Nb = v4 + v5 and l = l4 + l5. In ad-
dition eigenstates respect certain symmetries and hence

ous section, the possibility of various bifurcations occur-
ing in C2H2 with varying polyad Nb. Earlier studies[11]
have revealed that the lowest (trans bend) and highest
(cis bend) energy eigenstates in a given polyad undergo
a sharp change in character with increasing Nb. More
precisely, around Nb = 12 the lowest state is not the
usual trans bend and becomes a local bend whilst around
Nb = 14 the highest state changes character from a cis
bend to the so called counter-rotator mode. Such changes
are characterisitc of bifurcations which lead to new types
of modes (dynamics) and we expect the expectation val-
ues to be sensitive indicators of these changes. In order to

show this in Fig. 3a,b we show the
for the lowest and
the highest energy states as a function of Nb. As expected
very clearly indicate the sharp nature of the bi-
the
furcations in agreement with the previous observations.
In Fig. 3c,d we have also shown the IPRs of the states
in various basis for comparison. Note that the IPRs also
indicate the transition. However, the various IPRs in
the post transition regime take on very small values and
by deﬁnition this indicates that many zeroth order nor-
mal modes are contributing to the eigenstates and thus
suggesting highly mixed states. Contrast this with the
fact that all of the expectations are very large suggesting
highly localized states. The resolution to these appar-
ently conﬂicting observations lies in realizing that new
types of dynamics i.e., periodic orbits created due to the
bifurcations are inﬂuencing the eigenstates and the ze-
roth order normal modes are a poor basis to understand
the new modes. It is important to note that IPR in any
single resonance (dressed) basis is also an insuﬃcient in-
dicator of the new modes. The expectation values on the
other hand are quite sensitive and the nature of the new
modes can be deciphered with further analysis[12].

We now turn to an analysis of the states in [16, 0]g+. In
Fig. 4 the expectation values are shown for all the states.

Based on previous observations it is easy to identify the
local bend and the counter rotating states at the ener-
getic minimum and maximum of the polyad. The appear-
ance of rather complicated behaviour in the middle of the
polyad is related to the occurence of bifurcations with
varying energy[29]. Further understanding can be gained
by analyzing the reduced classical Hamiltonian[29]:

H(J, ψ ; K) = H0(J; K) + 2s45fa(J; K) cos ψa

+ 2r45fb(J; K) cos ψb

The angles ψa and ψb correspond to the DDI and the

Jung et. al. have used the semiclassical representation
of the eigenstates[31] in the (ψa, ψb) space to provide a
sequence of similarly localized states[29]. Two main fam-
ilies, I and II, were identiﬁed based on the excitation
along speciﬁc periodic orbits. In Fig. 4 we show two such
sequences, one from each family, as seen from the per-
spective of the expectation values.
It is apparent that
the family I is more robust than the family II sequence.
This is directly related to the fact that the periodic orbit
underlying family I undergoes far fewer bifurcations as

II. However even in the family I sequence two states

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this letter we have demonstrated the utility of eigen-
state expectation values of resonant perturbations in
understanding the nature of highly excited vibrational
states. A particularly large expectation value implies
that the associated eigenstate is localized and inﬂuenced
by a closed orbit in the classical phase space. Existence of
localized states and their sequences can be ascertained by
inspecting the expectation values (magnitude and sign)
and the IPRs irrespective of wether the classical phase
space is (near)-integrable, mixed or chaotic. In case of
complete chaos, from random matrix theory arguments,
a typical expectation value is expected[32] to be 1/√Ns.
The examples studied here are quite far from such a
limit. Combined with the relative signs of the expec-
tation values it is possible to identify speciﬁc eigenstate
sequences. Sensitivity of the expectation values to the bi-
furcations provides information on the birth of new types
of modes and the resulting perturbations on the eigen-
state sequences. Currently it is not possible to identify
the type of bifurcation that occurs and this aspect needs
further study.
It is important to note that we are not
advocating the use of periodic orbits to compute the ex-
pectation values which is a diﬃcult task. Instead we are
emphasizing the manifestation and utility of such classi-
cal structures in a fundamental quantum object i.e., an

7

expectation value. Similar philosophy has been adopted
in the ’vibrogram’ or (E, τ ) approaches to study reso-
nant systems[33, 34] This classical-quantum correspon-
dence aspect of the expectation values can be easily ap-
plied to multidimensional coupled systems without the
need for determining/visualization of phase space, peri-
odic orbits or eigenstates. Indeed preliminary work on a
coupled 4-mode eﬀective Hamiltonian suggests that such
an approach is useful.

Finally we note that Jacobson and Field have
recently[35] studied expectation values of resonance op-
erators for a nonstationary state. Choosing the non-
v
stationary state to be a zeroth order bright state

it was shown that the time-dependent expectations

Thus the time-dependent expectations are, in the inﬁnite
time limit, nothing but intensity weighted eigenstate ex-
pectation values. Such an object, the intensity-velocity
correlator, has been recently introduced and studied in
great detail[36].

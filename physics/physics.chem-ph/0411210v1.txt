Three Diﬀerent Sizes Obtained Using Light
Scattering Techniques

Yong Sun

February 20, 2014

Abstract

The average scattered intensity is determined by the optical charac-
teristics of particles in dispersion. The normalized time auto-correlation
function of the scattered light intensity g(2) (τ ) includes both the optical
and hydrodynamic information of particles. From the diﬀerent character-
istics of particles, the particle sizes can be obtained. In this paper, three
sizes: the static radius Rs, the hydrodynamic radius Rh and the apparent
hydrodynamic radius Rh,app are discussed using dilute water dispersions
of homogenous spherical particles poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) microgels,
with a simple assumption that the hydrodynamic radius is in proportion
to the static radius, when Rayleigh-Gans-Debye approximation is valid.
Our results show that the diﬀerence between the mean static radii and the
apparent hydrodynamic radii is large and the diﬀerence between the mean
hydrodynamic radii and the apparent hydrodynamic radii is inﬂuenced by
the particle size distribution.

1 Introduction

A great deal of information about particles in dispersion can be obtained using
light scattering techniques. One of the main applications of the light scattering
techniques is that measure the particle sizes. The static light scattering tech-
nique (SLS) obtains the size information from the optical characteristics and
the dynamic light scattering technique (DLS) obtains the size information from
both the optical and hydrodynamic features of particles.

During the last few decades, the standard method of cumulant is used to
obtain the apparent hydrodynamic radius Rn,app and its distribution G (Rh,app)
for particles from the normalized time auto-correlation function of the scattered
light intensity g(2) (τ ) with the assistance of the Einstein-Stokes relation, where
τ is a delay time. The treatment of SLS is simpliﬁed to the Zimm plot, Berry
to obtain the root mean-square radius of gyration
plot or Guinier plot etc.

and the molar mass of particles provided that the particle sizes are

[3]] think that the measurements of the
SLS and DLS techniques. People [[1]

/Rh,app can provide a relatively

unambiguous test for the particle shape. In this judgement, there have an as-
sumption that the sizes obtained from SLS and DLS are the same. However,
the sizes obtained from SLS and DLS are diﬀerent physical quantities[[4], [5]].
Exactly using the light scattering techniques, three diﬀerent sizes can be ob-
tained for homogenous spherical particles: one is static radii Rs obtained from
the optical characteristics; the second is hydrodynamic radii Rh obtained from
the hydrodynamic features and the third is apparent hydrodynamic radii Rh,app
determined by the both optical and hydrodynamic characteristics of particles.
In this article, the three diﬀerent sizes will be discussed using PNIPAM
microgel samples with a simple assumption that hydrodynamic radius Rh is
in proportion to the static radius Rs. With this simple assumption, the re-
lationship between the SLS and DLS can be built for homogenous spherical
particles. Our results show that the expected values of the normalized time
auto-correlation function of the scattered light intensity are consistent with the
experimental data very well and the diﬀerence between the static radius and
the apparent hydrodynamic radius is large and the diﬀerence between the hy-
drodynamic radius and the apparent hydrodynamic radius is inﬂuenced by the
particle size distribution.

2 Theory

For homogeneous spherical particles where the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD)
approximation is valid, the normalized time auto-correlation function of the
electric ﬁeld of the scattered light g(1) (τ ) is given by

The SLS and DLS spectroscopies were measured using the instrument built by
ALV-Laser Vertriebsgesellschaft m.b.H (Langen, Germany). It utilizes an ALV-
5000 Multiple Tau Digital Correlator and a JDS Uniphase 1145P He-Ne laser
to provide a 23 mW vertically polarized laser at wavelength of 632.8 nm.

In this experiment, N -isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM, monomer) from Acros
Organics was recrystallized from hexane/acetone solution. Potassium persul-
fate (KPS, initiator) and N, N ′-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS, cross-linker) from
Aldrich were used as received. Fresh de-ionized water from a Milli-Q Plus water
puriﬁcation system (Millipore, Bedford, with a 0.2 µm ﬁlter) was used through-
out the whole experiment. The synthesis of gel particles was described elsewhere
[[7], [8]] and the recipes of the batches used in this work are listed in Table 1.

5 Results and Discussion

From the above analysis, three diﬀerent sizes can be obtained using the light
scattering techniques.
In general, the values of constant a vary little during
the small scattering angle range and the values of the apparent hydrodynamic
radius Rh,app are a function of the scattering angle. In order to compare the
three diﬀerent sizes conveniently, all the mean hydrodynamic and the apparent
hydrodynamic radii were obtained at a scattering angle of 30o. All three sizes
obtained at diﬀerent temperatures for P N IP AM
1 are shown in Fig. 5.1. The
picture shows that the diﬀerence between the mean static radii and the apparent
hydrodynamic radii is large and the diﬀerence between the mean hydrodynamic
radii and the apparent hydrodynamic radii is inﬂuenced by the particle size
distribution.

The three diﬀerent sizes represent the diﬀerent characteristics of particles.
When temperature change from 25oC to 40oC, the characteristics of PNIPAM
microgel samples change from being hydrophilic to hydrophobic. It is possible
that this change will has the diﬀerent eﬀects on the optical and hydrodynamic
characteristics of particles. In order to show the results of this eﬀects, the ratios

From the ﬁt results for the four PNIPAM microgel sample, the particle size
distributions are narrow both below and above the phase transition and are wide
at the phase transition. Figure 5.2 shows clearly that the diﬀerence between the
apparent hydrodynamic radii and the mean hydrodynamic radii is inﬂuenced
by the distribution widths. For small poly-dispersities, the value of apparent
hydrodynamic radius is almost the same as that of the mean hydrodynamic
radius. For wide distributions, the part of apparent hydrodynamic radius rep-

mono-disperse particle systems, since the eﬀects of scattered intensity are can-

From the chemical knowledge, the materials of PNIPAM possess the temper-

sensitivity of PNIPAM microgels will be inﬂuenced by the content of the N, N ′-
methylenebisacrylamide which does not possess the temperature sensitivity. If
the content of the N, N ′-methylenebisacrylamide continues to increase, the tem-
perature sensitivity of PNIPAM microgels is becoming weak. Figure 5.3 clearly
shows the feature. The phase transition of PNIPAM microgels, indicated as the

6 Conclusion

The average scattered intensity is determined by the optical characteristics of
particles in dispersion. The normalized time auto-correlation function of the
scattered light intensity g(2) (τ ) includes both the optical and hydrodynamic
information of particles. Using the light scattering techniques, three diﬀerent
particle sizes can be measured. The static radius represents the optical char-
acteristics, the hydrodynamic radius shows the hydrodynamic features and the
apparent hydrodynamic radius represents both the optical and hydrodynamic
characteristics of particles. For narrow distributions, the value of the appar-
ent hydrodynamic radius is a good approximation of the mean hydrodynamic
radius. In general, the sizes obtained from SLS and DLS are diﬀerent. If the
relationship between the optical and hydrodynamic features of particles can be
understood, the accurate relationship between the SLS and DLS can be built.
Then the static sizes also can be obtained from the DLS data. The accurate
relationship between the optical and hydrodynamic features of particles can be
further explored.

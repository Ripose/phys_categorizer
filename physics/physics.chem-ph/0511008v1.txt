INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

The last ﬁfteen years witnessed the development of a number of
”black-box” computational thermochemistry methods. Among them,
the G1/G2/G3 theories and their variants, and the CBS-Q family of
methods by Petersson and coworkers are worth mentioning in particu-
lar. In addition to these wavefunction-based approaches, density func-
tional methods – aside from their great popularity as a general tool
for practical computational chemistry – have gained some currency for
computational thermochemistry in the medium accuracy range, as have
group equivalent-based models. For very large systems, semiempirical
methods remain popular.

At the other extreme in terms of system size and accuracy stand
brute-force approaches such as those based on wavefunctions with ex-
plicit interelectronic distances.

Methods such as G3 and CBS-QB3 do reach the goal of ”chemical
accuracy” (generally deﬁned as ±1 kcal/mol) on average, but worst-case
errors for problematic molecules may exceed this criterion by almost an
order of magnitude. In addition, almost all of these approaches involve
some level of parameterization and/or empirical correction against ex-
perimental data. While this is by and large possible (albeit not without
pitfalls) in the kcal/mol accuracy range for ﬁrst-and second-row com-
pounds, experimental data of sub-kcal/mol accuracy are thin on the

31

32

Chapter 2

ground, and the available data for transition metal compounds are sim-
ply too scarce for this to be a useful approach.

There would thus appear to be room for a more or less ”black box”
computational thermochemistry method that has the following proper-
ties:

1. it on average achieves ”benchmark accuracy”, which we shall ar-
bitrarily deﬁne as one unit of the most common tabulation unit in
thermochemical reference tables, i.e. 1 kJ/mol (0.24 kcal/mol);

2. the worst-case error should not exceed 1 kcal/mol (”chemical ac-

curacy”) except perhaps in intrinsically pathological cases;

3. it is still eﬃcient enough for applications to systems with up to six

heavy atoms on modern workstations;

4. it is entirely devoid of parameters derived from experiment (and
hence from bias towards the systems used for parameterization).

These have been the design goals in our development of the W1 and W2
(Weizmann-1 and Weizmann-2) theories [1].

The usual design philosophy for this type of methods is bottom-up:
one starts with an approximate model, compares results with experi-
ments, analyzes the deviations, and uses them to determine empirical
corrections and/or additional terms to be added to the model, after
which the cycle is repeated if desired.

Our philosophy was instead ”top-down”. We decomposed the molec-
ular TAE (total atomization energy: TAEe at the bottom of the well,
TAE0 at absolute zero) into all components that can reasonably aﬀect it
at the kJ/mol level. Then we carried out exhaustive benchmark calcu-
lations on each component separately for a representative ”training set”
of molecules. Finally, for each component separately, we progressively
introduced approximations up to the point where reproduction of that
particular component started deteriorating to an unacceptable extent.
Thus, experimental data entered the picture only at the validation stage,
not at the design stage.

Another philosophical issue centers on whether a method should be
a ”protocol” speciﬁed down to the last detail (i.e. be truly ”black-box”),
or whether it should merely outline a general approach with minor de-
tails to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Obviously a method where
empirical parameterization is kept to the absolute minimum or is ab-
sent altogether will oﬀer more ‘degrees of freedom’ in this regard than
the one where a minor change in the protocol would, for consistency,
require reparameterization against a large experimental data set. Yet

W1 and W2 theories

33

our general guideline was that, while such choices should be possible for
an experienced computational chemist, they should not be an essential
part of the process itself.

2.

STEPS IN THE W1 AND W2 THEORIES,
AND THEIR JUSTIFICATION

The more cost-eﬀective W1 theory and the more rigorous W2 the-
ory have a lot of points in common. Aside from issues relating to the
reference geometry and the zero-point energy, the main diﬀerence con-
cerns the basis sets used in the extrapolation steps for the SCF and the
valence correlation contribution.

These basis sets belong to the ”correlation consistent” family of
Dunning and coworkers [2, 3]. The correlation consistent (cc) basis sets,
besides being arguably the most compact ones in their accuracy range [4],
have the important property that, by design, they treat radial and an-
gular correlation in a balanced way. In addition to the regular cc-pVnZ
(correlation consistent polarized valence n-tuple zeta, or VnZ for short)
basis sets, several variants have been published. In particular we note
the aug-cc-pVnZ or AVnZ basis sets [5] for anions (with the combina-
tion of regular cc-pVnZ on hydrogen and aug-cc-pVnZ on other elements
generally being denoted aug′-cc-pVnZ [6], or A′VnZ for short), the MT
(Martin-Taylor [7, 8]) and cc-pCVnZ [9] basis sets for inner-shell corre-
lation, and the cc-pVnZ+1 [10], cc-pVnZ+2d1f [11], and (most recently)
cc-pV(n+d)Z[12] basis sets for second-row atoms exhibiting ‘inner po-
larization’ [11] (vide infra).

We consider here the following sequence of correlation consistent
basis sets: A′VDZ+2d, A′VTZ+2d1f, A′VQZ+2d1f, and A′V5Z+2d1f,
which we shall denote ”small”, ”medium”, ”large”, and ”extra large”
(for ﬁrst-and second-row compounds, these basis sets are of spd, spdf ,
spdf g, and spdf gh quality, respectively). W1 theory, then, carries out all
extrapolations using ”small”, ”medium”, and ”large”, while W2 theory
employs ”medium”, ”large”, and ”extra-large” basis sets.

The W1 and W2 protocols for obtaining the total atomization en-

ergy (TAE) of a given molecule involve the following steps:

1. Geometry optimization at the B3LYP/VTZ+1 level for W1, and

at the CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 level for W2.

2. Extrapolation of the SCF component of TAE from the ”small”,
”medium”, and ”large” basis sets (W1) or ”medium”, ”large”, and
”extra-large” basis sets (W2), by means of either the geometric

34

Chapter 2

extrapolation formula E(n) = E∞ + A/Bn (old-style) or the two-
point formula E(n) = E∞ + A/n5 (new-style).

3. Extrapolation of the CCSD valence correlation component of TAE
from the ”medium” and ”large” basis sets (W1) or from the ”large”
and ”extra-large” basis sets (W2) employing the two-point formula
E(n) = E∞ + A/Bα, where α = 3.22 (W1) or 3 exactly (W2).

4. Extrapolation of the contribution to TAE of the connected triple
excitations, (T), from the valence orbitals using the same formulae
as for CCSD, but employing instead the ”small” and ”medium”
basis sets (W1) or the ”medium” and ”large” basis sets (W2).

5. The contribution of inner-shell correlation is taken as the diﬀerence
between the CCSD(T)/MTsmall TAE with and without constrain-
ing the inner-shell orbitals to be doubly occupied.

6. The scalar relativistic contribution is computed as the ﬁrst-order
Darwin and mass-velocity corrections from the ACPF/MTsmall
wave function, including inner-shell correlation.

7. The contribution to TAE of spin-orbit splitting in the constituent
atoms is trivially obtained from a tabulation, while for molecules
in degenerate ground states, CISD/MTsmall spin-orbit splittings
are computed (allowing correlation from the 2s and 2p orbitals in
second-row atoms).

8. The zero-point vibrational energy (EZPV) is obtained from har-
monic B3LYP/VTZ+1 frequencies scaled by 0.985 in the case of
W1 theory. For W2 theory, anharmonic values of EZPV from quar-
tic force ﬁelds at the CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 (or comparable) level are
preferred; where this is not feasible, the same procedure as for W1
theory is followed as a ”fallback solution”.

We shall now proceed to explain in detail these steps and the rationale
behind them.

2.1.

Reference Geometry

Near the equilibrium geometry, dependence of the energy on ge-
ometric displacements is approximately quadratic. As a result, small
errors in the reference geometry will insigniﬁcantly aﬀect computed en-
ergies, but more substantial errors (say, several hundredths of an ˚A in
covalent bond lengths) will compromise the reliability of a thermochem-
ical calculation.

W1 and W2 theories

35

For W1 theory, we chose B3LYP [13, 14] density functional theory
with the VTZ+1 basis set as the level of theory for the reference geom-
etry, where the +1 suﬃx denotes the addition to second-row atoms of
the highest-exponent d function from the V5Z basis set [10]. For ﬁrst-
row molecules, B3LYP/VTZ bond lengths are generally within 0.003 ˚A
from experiment [15]; for second-row molecules, signiﬁcant errors can be
seen [10, 16] unless a tight d function is added to the basis set to account
for inner polarization (see below).

For W2 theory, we opted for CCSD(T)/VQZ+1 as the level of the-
ory for reference geometries. For geometries, the VQZ basis set is known
to be close to the one-particle basis set limit [17, 18], while the addition
of the inner polarization functions again takes care of inner polarization
eﬀects.

2.2.

The SCF Component of TAE

For systems devoid of nondynamical correlation eﬀects, this is the
largest individual contribution to the molecular binding energy. Its ba-
sis set convergence is relatively rapid, yet our discussion will be dispro-
portionately long because a number of the ”dramatis personae” that
reappear in the remainder of the story need to be introduced here.

For the SCF energy, we can – at least for small systems – obtain
an exact answer by means of numerical SCF calculations. There is sub-
stantial empirical evidence that its convergence behavior is exponential.
Jensen studied the SCF convergence behavior of the SCF energy in H2
[19] and H+
3 and N2 [20] and found clear evidence of geometric con-
vergence behavior in terms of both the maximum angular momentum
in the basis set and the number of primitives within a given angular
momentum.

Martin and Taylor [21] compared numerical SCF energies with ex-
trapolations from calculated SCF/A′VQZ, SCF/A′V5Z, and SCF/A′V6Z
energies using the formula

E(L) = E∞ + A/BL

(2.1)

(which is equivalent to E(L) = E∞ + A exp(−BL) originally proposed by
Feller [22]) and, for a number of number of molecules, found discrepan-
cies of 10 µEh or less between the numerical and extrapolated values.

Petersson et al. had earlier proposed [23] an alternative expression
∞
l=n+1 A/(l + 1/2)6 in the context of the CBS methods
E(n) = E∞ +
developed in his group. The summation is carried out numerically in
that paper, but in fact an elegant analytical approximation exists for

P

summations of this type:

Hence

(n − 1)!(L + 1)n−1 + O(L−(n+1))

A
(n − 1)(L + 1)n−1 .

(2.4)

This suggests the simple extrapolation formula E(n) = E∞ + A/n5, i.e.
E∞ = E(n) + E(n)−E(n−1)
(n/n−1)5−1 , where n is identiﬁed with the “n-tuple ze-
taness” of the Dunning correlation consistent VnZ basis sets. (For hy-
drogen and helium, n equals the maximum angular momentum plus one;
for the main group elements it is equal to the maximum angular momen-
tum). While an argumentation in favor of the Petersson-type formula
can be built on the convergence behavior of triplet-coupled pairs, neither
this formula nor the geometric one have a solid formal basis.

Fortunately, convergence on the SCF component of atomization en-
ergies is even more rapid than for the total energies; Martin and Taylor
found for 14 ﬁrst-row molecules [25] that diﬀerences between unextrapo-
lated SCF/A′V5Z, geometrical extrapolations from SCF/A′V{T,Q,5}Z,
and A + B/L5 extrapolations from SCF/A′V{Q,5}Z results are on the
order of 0.01 kcal/mol. For the method that we designated W2, which
uses this basis set sequence, the choice of SCF extrapolation method is
largely a non-issue. For the method that we designated W1, however,
the geometric formula entails the use of results from the comparatively
small A′VDZ basis set, which compromises the reliability of extrapolated
SCF limits in systems with slow basis set convergence. In some cases
(see Table 1 in Ref. 26), these can lead to errors of several kcal/mol.
In addition, the two-point A + B/L5 formula has the elegant property

W1 and W2 theories

37

that it becomes immaterial whether the extrapolation is carried out on
a reaction energy or on the individual absolute energies.

In the original W1/W2 paper [1], we opted for the geometric for-
mula in view of the observed geometric convergence behavior.
In a
subsequent validation study [26] on a much wider variety of systems, we
however found the two-point formula to be much more reliable, and we
have adopted it henceforth.

Finally, an issue that arises with second-row systems should be ad-
dressed. It was ﬁrst noted by Bauschlicher and Partridge [27] that the
atomization energy of SO2 is exceedingly sensitive to the presence of
high-exponent d and f functions in the basis set. This phenomenon was
ascribed to hypervalence; Martin and Uzan [10], however, found that the
same phenomenon exists in systems that cannot be considered hyperva-
lent by the wildest stretch of the imagination, like AlF. In addition, it
was found [11, 16] that properties other than the energy are aﬀected as
in SO2 [11] and SO3 [16]) errors of up to 50 cm−1 in
well, with (e.g.
harmonic frequencies and hundredths of ˚A in bond lengths unless high-
exponent d and f functions (termed ”inner polarization functions” in
Ref. 11 are added to the basis set.

We should note that inner polarization is strictly an SCF-level ef-
fect: while, for instance, switching from an A′VDZ to an A′VDZ+2d
basis set aﬀects the computed atomization energy of SO3 by as much as
40 kcal/mol (!), almost all of this eﬀect is seen in the SCF component of
the TAE [28]. In fact, we have recently found [29] that the eﬀect persists
if the (1s, 2s, 2p) orbitals on the second-row atom are all replaced by a
pseudopotential. What is really getting ”polarized” here is the inner
part of the valence orbitals, which requires polarizations functions that
are much ”tighter” (higher-exponent) than those required for the outer
part of the valence orbital. The fact that these inner polarization func-
tions are in the same exponent range as the d and f functions required
for correlation out of the (2s, 2p) orbitals is merely coincidental; the ”in-
ner polarization” eﬀect has nothing to do with correlation, let alone with
inner-shell correlation.

After extensive numerical experimentation, we have decided [1] on
the sequence of basis sets noted above: ”small” A′VDZ+2d, ”medium”
A′VTZ+2d1f, ”large” A′VQZ+2d1f, and ”extra large” A′V5Z+2d1f.

As the present review was being ﬁnalized for publication, we re-
ceived a preprint by Dunning et al. [12] where new cc-pV(n+d)Z basis
sets are proposed for the second-row atoms. These basis sets do have just
an added tight d function (hence the acronym) and no tight f functions,
but the remaining d functions in the underlying cc-pVnZ basis set are in

38

Chapter 2

addition reoptimized. We are currently investigating their performance
in W1 and W2-type schemes.

2.3.

The CCSD Valence Correlation Component of TAE

The valence correlation component of TAE is the only one that
can rival the SCF component in importance. As is well known by now
(and is a logical consequence of the structure of the exact nonrelativistic
Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian on one hand, and the use of a Hartree-
Fock reference wavefunction on the other hand), molecular correlation
energies tend to be dominated by double excitations and disconnected
products thereof. Single excitation energies become important only in
systems with appreciable nondynamical correlation. Nonetheless, since
the number of single-excitation amplitudes is so small compared to the
double-excitation amplitudes, there is no point in treating them sepa-
rately.

For all intents and purposes then, we are concerned here with the
CCSD (coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions [30])
correlation energy. Its convergence is excruciatingly slow: Schwartz [31]
showed as early as 1963 that the increments of successive angular mo-
menta l to the second-order correlation energy of helium-like atoms con-
verge as

∆E(l) = A/(l + 1/2)4 + B/(l + 1/2)6 + . . . .

(2.5)

His conclusions were generalized to other methods and general pair cor-
relation energies by Hill [32] and by Kutzelnigg and Morgan [33].

This clearly spells a rather bleak picture of basis set convergence.
Indeed, Martin [17] showed in 1994 that while convergence of σ bond
energies appeared in sight at the CCSD(T)/spdf g level, this did not
yet appear to be the case for π bond energies. This earlier study was
extended in 1996 [34] to basis sets of spdf gh quality: somewhat depress-
ingly, residual errors in the binding energies as high as 2 kcal/mol were
still found for small systems.

However, rather than ”knuckling under” to Eq.(2.5) at this stage,
we might instead exploit it for an extrapolation formula. Martin [34]
suggested a three-point extrapolation of the form A + B/(n + 1/2)C
(where n is identiﬁed with the cardinal number of the cc-pVnZ basis
set), and obtained dramatically improved computed total atomization
energies. A slight further improvement was achieved if the SCF and
valence correlation energies – which have fundamentally diﬀerent con-
vergence behaviors – are extrapolated separately using the respective
appropriate formulae [25].

W1 and W2 theories

39

The denominator shift of 1/2 was chosen as a compromise between
the situation for hydrogen and helium (where n = l + 1 for the cc-pVnZ
basis set) and main-group elements (where n = l). As is immediately
obvious upon series expansion, there is considerable coupling between
the denominator shift and the exponent. As a result, the three-point
extrapolation generally leads to exponents well in excess of three [34].

Halkier et al. [35] found that the simple expression E(L) = E∞ +
A/L3 [i.e. E∞ = E(L) + E(L)−E(L−1)
In
view of its simplicity and the fact that no results with the questionable
A′VDZ basis set are required, we have adopted this simple formula for
extrapolation of the CCSD valence correlation energy in W1 and W2
theories.

(L/L−1)3−1 ] works at least equally well.

For the smaller basis sets used in W1 theory, the regime where the
leading E∞ + A/L3 term dominates convergence behavior has not yet
been reached, and using the formula in its unmodiﬁed form leads to
overestimated (in absolute value) CCSD limits. One unelegant solution
would be the use of three-term extrapolations like E∞ + A/L3 + B/L4,
but in light of the poor quality of the VDZ basis set this is a most
unsatisfactory alternative. Another alternative is the use of a two-point
extrapolation E∞ + A/Lα, in which α is a ﬁxed empirical parameter.
By minimizing the deviation from the W2 CCSD limit for the so-called
W2-1 set of 28 molecules (vide infra), we determined α = 3.22, which is
the value used in W1 theory and its variants.

2.4.

Connected Triple Excitations: the (T) Valence
Correlation Component of TAE

It has been well known for some time (e.g. [36]) that the next com-
ponent in importance is that of connected triple excitations. By far
the most cost-eﬀective way of estimating them has been the quasiper-
turbative approach known as CCSD(T) introduced by Raghavachari et
al. [37], in which the fourth-order and ﬁfth-order perturbation theory
expressions for the most important terms are used with the converged
CCSD amplitudes for the ﬁrst-order wavefunction. This account for
substantial fractions of the higher-order contributions; a very recent de-
tailed analysis by Cremer and He [38] suggests that 87, 80, and 72 %,
respectively, of the sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-order terms appearing in
the much more expensive CCSDT-1a method are included implicitly in
CCSD(T).

Nevertheless, the formidable n3N4 (with n the number of electrons
and N the number of basis functions) cost scaling of the CCSD(T)

40

Chapter 2

method creates a substantial barrier to applications of methods that
require A′V5Z+2d1f basis sets. However, two things should be kept in
mind. First of all, the (T) component of TAE is a small fraction of
the CCSD component, and hence a larger relative error can be toler-
ated. Secondly, evidence exists [39] that basis set convergence of the (T)
contribution is substantially more rapid than that of the CCSD energy.
As a result, one may justiﬁably extrapolate the (T) contribution
from smaller basis sets than its CCSD counterpart:
in W1 theory, we
extrapolate from the ”small” and ”medium” basis sets, and in W2 theory
from the ”medium” and ”large” basis sets. This means that the most
extensive basis sets in the calculations, namely ”large” in W1 theory
and ”extra large” in W2 theory only require CCSD calculations, which
are both much less expensive than CCSD(T) and much more amenable
to direct algorithms such as those described in Refs. 40-41.

2.5.

The Inner-Shell Correlation Component of TAE

Inner-shell correlation is a substantial part of the absolute corre-
lation energy even for late ﬁrst-row systems; for second-row systems,
it in fact rivals the absolute valence correlation energy in importance.
However,
its relative contribution to molecular TAEs is fairly small:
in benzene, for instance, it amounts to less than 0.7 % of the TAE.
Even so, at 7 kcal/mol, its contribution is important by any reasonable
thermochemical standard. By the same token, a 1 % relative error in a
7 kcal/mol contribution is tolerable even by benchmark thermochemistry
standards, while the same relative error in a 300 kcal/mol contribution
would be unacceptable even by the ”chemical accuracy” standards.

In addition, for thermochemical purposes we are primarily inter-
ested in the core-valence correlation, since we can reasonably expect the
core-core contributions to largely cancel between the molecule and its
constituent atoms.
(The partitioning between core-core correlation –
involving excitations only from inner-shell orbitals – and core-valence
correlation – involving simultaneous excitations from valence and inner-
shell orbitals – was ﬁrst proposed by Bauschlicher, Langhoﬀ, and Taylor
[42]).

For these reasons, we feel justiﬁed in treating the inner-shell cor-
relation contribution to TAE as a separate contribution, rather than
together with the valence correlation. There are substantial cost advan-
tages to this: rather than having to carry out very elaborate all-electrons-
correlated CCSD(T) calculations in basis sets near saturation for both
valence and inner-shell correlation, we can limit these costly calculations
to a basis set that is primarily saturated for inner-shell correlation.

W1 and W2 theories

41

Inner-shell correlation contributions for the W2-1 set were studied
in some detail in the original W1/W2 paper, while subsequently, Martin,
Sundermann, Fast, and Truhlar (MSFT) [43] studied inner-shell correla-
tion contributions to TAE for 125 molecules spanning the ﬁrst two rows
of the periodic table. The following conclusions can be drawn from these
two studies: (a) the use of the CCSD(T) electron correlation method is
absolutely required for reliable contributions: the use of MP2 or CCSD
can lead to underestimates in the order of 50 %; (b) the smallest basis set
which gives acceptable agreement with near-basis set limit contributions
is the MTsmall basis set, which is a completely decontracted cc-pVTZ
basis set with (2d1f ) additional high-exponent correlation functions; (c)
the eﬀect of including even higher excitations in the correlation treat-
ment is insigniﬁcant.

A tentative explanation for the importance of connected triple exci-
tations for the inner-shell contribution to TAE can be found in the need
to account for simultaneously correlating a valence orbital and relax-
ing an inner-shell orbital, or conversely, requiring a double and a single
excitation simultaneously.

In principle, one could contract at least the few innermost s primitives
and reduce the basis set further. By leaving the basis set completely un-
contracted, however, we can recycle the integrals and SCF wavefunction
for the next step of the calculation.

Finally, it is generally advised not to correlate the very deep-lying
(1s) orbitals on second-row elements, as the MTsmall basis set does
not have angular correlation functions in the required exponent range,
and in addition the orbitals concerned are in the same energy range as
the (2s, 2p) orbitals in third-row main group elements, for which being
able to take a [Ne] core out of the correlation problem does result in
appreciable CPU time savings.

2.6.

Scalar Relativistic Correction

The importance of scalar relativistic eﬀects for compounds of tran-
sition metals and/or heavy main group elements is well established by
now [44]. Somewhat surprisingly (at ﬁrst sight), they may have non-
trivial contributions to the TAE of ﬁrst-row and second-row systems as
well, in particular if several polar bonds to a group VI or VII element are
involved. For instance, in BF3, SO3, and SiF4, scalar relativistic eﬀects
reduce TAE by 0.7, 1.2, and 1.9 kcal/mol, respectively – quantities which
clearly matter even if only ”chemical accuracy” is sought. Likewise, in
a benchmark study on the electron aﬃnities of the ﬁrst-and second-row
atoms [45] – where we were able to reproduce the experimental values to

42

Chapter 2

within 0.001 eV on average – we saw that neglect of the scalar relativistic
contributions increased mean deviation from experiment by more than
an order of magnitude.

Perhaps the simplest and most cost-eﬀective way of treating rela-
tivistic contributions in an all-electron framework is the ﬁrst-order per-
turbation theory of the one-electron Darwin and mass-velocity opera-
tors [46, 47]. For variational wavefunctions, these contributions can be
evaluated very eﬃciently as expectation values of one-electron operators.
It has been found repeatedly [1, 43, 45] that scalar relativistic con-
tributions are overestimated by about 20–25 % in absolute value at the
SCF level. Hence inclusion of electron correlation is essential: we found
the ACPF method (which is both variational and approximately size
extensive) to be an excellent compromise between quality and cost. It
is reasonable to suppose that for a property that becomes more impor-
tant as one approaches the nucleus, one wants maximum ﬂexibility of
the wavefunction near the nucleus as well as correlation of all electrons;
thus we ﬁnally opted for ACPF/MTsmall as our approach of choice.
Typically the cost of the scalar relativistic step is a fairly small fraction
of that of the core correlation step, since only n2N4 scaling is involved
in the ACPF calculations.

Bauschlicher [48] compared a number of approximate approaches
for scalar relativistic eﬀects to Douglas-Kroll quasirelativistic CCSD(T)
calculations. He found that the ACPF/MTsmall level of theory faith-
fully reproduces his more rigorous calculations, while the use of non-size
extensive approaches like CISD leads to serious errors. For third-row
main group systems, studies by the same author [49] indicate that more
rigorous approaches may be in order.

2.7.

Spin-Orbit Coupling

The other relativistic eﬀect entirely neglected so far is the spin-orbit
coupling. For systems in nondegenerate states, the only ﬁrst-order con-
tribution to TAE comes from the ﬁne structures in the corresponding
atoms. Their eﬀects can trivially be obtained from the observed elec-
tronic spectra, and hence the computational cost of this correction is
fundamentally zero.

For systems in degenerate states, ﬁrst-order corrections may need
to be computed. In our work [26] we found that this signiﬁcantly re-
duced the mean absolute error for the G2-1 and G2-2 test sets for ion-
ization potentials and electron aﬃnities, in no small part due to the
preponderance of atoms and linear molecules in these sets. We found
that CISD/MTsmall generally yields quite satisfactory spin-orbit correc-

tions, but that it is advisable to correlate the (2s, 2p)-like electrons in the
second-row elements. For the halogen atoms, convergence of these con-
tributions with the level of theory was studied in some detail by Nicklass
et al. [50]. These authors came to fundamentally the same conclusions.

2.8.

The Zero-Point Vibrational Energy

P

It has been noted repeatedly (e.g. [51, 52, 53]) that one-half the
sum of the harmonic frequencies, 1
i ωi di (with di representing the
2
degeneracy of mode i) generally leads to an overestimate of the EZPV,
and that one-half the sum of the fundamentals, 1
i νi di, generally leads
2
to an underestimate. In fact, it is easily shown that the average of these
two estimates is a fairly good approximation to the anharmonic EZPV.
For the sake of convenience, we shall restrict ourselves to the case
of symmetric tops, asymmetric tops being a special case thereof with no
degenerate modes. Including only up to ﬁrst-order anharmonicities Xij,
and excluding the small constant E0, the vibrational energy is given as

monicity constants can be estimated from anharmonicities in diatomic
molecules.

The common practice of scaling computed vibrational frequencies
for comparison with experimental fundamentals attempts at approxi-
mately addressing two issues: (a) the imperfections of the theoretical
model for the harmonic frequency (which for CCSD(T), or even B3LYP,
in suﬃciently large basis sets is basically unnecessary); and (b) the an-
harmonic contribution to the fundamental. The above analysis suggests
that a scaling factor that is intermediate between those used for re-
producing harmonics and fundamentals would be the most appropriate
for anharmonicities.
In the original W1 paper [1], we considered the
essentially exact anharmonic values of EZPV of the 28 W2-1 molecules
(determined from experiment or large basis set CCSD(T) quartic force
ﬁeld calculations, e.g. [54] and the references therein) and found the ap-
propriate scaling factor for B3LYP/VTZ+1 harmonic frequencies to be
0.985. The largest individual deviation between the scaled harmonic and
exact anharmonic values of EZPV was only 0.3 kcal/mol (for PH3).

Some of the above remarks are probably best illustrated by an ex-
ample. For benzene, a B3LYP/TZ2P quartic force ﬁeld was computed by
Handy and coworkers [55]. From the published anharmonicity constants
(speciﬁcally, the set deperturbed for Fermi resonances closer than 100
cm−1), we obtain an anharmonic EZPV of 62.04 kcal/mol. For compari-
son, one-half the sum of the harmonics comes out 0.9 kcal/mol too high
at 62.96 kcal/mol, and one-half the sum of the fundamentals comes out
1 kcal/mol too low at 60.98 kcal/mol. The average of both values, 61.97
kcal/mol, is in excellent agreement with the anharmonic value, while
the W1 estimate accidentally agrees to within two decimal places with
the B3LYP/TZ2P anharmonic value. From the best available computed
harmonic frequencies [56] and the best available experimental fundamen-
tals [55], we obtain EZPV = 62.01 kcal/mol or, after correction for the
diﬀerence between this estimate and the true anharmonic EZPV at the
B3LYP/TZ2P level, 0.07 kcal/mol, we ﬁnd EZPV = 62.08 kcal/mol as
possibly the best estimate. (Note that HF/6-31G* harmonic frequen-
cies scaled by 0.8929, as used in G2 and G3 theories, yields only 60.33
kcal/mol. In this accuracy range, one certainly cannot indulge in a 1.7
kcal/mol underestimate in the zero-point energy!)

In a recent benchmark study [57] on the CH2=NH molecule, we ex-
plicitly computed a CCSD(T)/VTZ quartic force ﬁeld at great expense
(the low symmetry necessitated the computation of 2241 energy points
in Cs symmetry and 460 additional points in C1 symmetry). The result-
ing anharmonic EZPV, 24.69 kcal/mol, is only 0.10 kcal/mol above the
scaled B3LYP/VTZ estimate, 24.59 kcal/mol. At least for fairly rigid

46

Chapter 2

molecules, it appears hard to justify the additional expense and eﬀort
for the anharmonic force ﬁeld unless it were required anyway for other
purposes.

If we use B3LYP/VTZ+1 harmonics scaled by 0.985 for the EZPV
rather than the actual anharmonic values, mean absolute error at the
W1 level deteriorates from 0.37 to 0.40 kcal/mol, which most users would
regard as insigniﬁcant. At the W2 level, however, we see a somewhat
more noticeable degradation from 0.23 to 0.30 kcal/mol — if kJ/mol
accuracy is required, literally ”every little bit counts”. If one is primar-
ily concerned with keeping the maximum absolute error down, rather
than getting sub-kJ/mol accuracy for individual molecules, the use of
B3LYP/VTZ+1 harmonic values of EZPV scaled by 0.985 is an accept-
able ”fallback solution”. The same would appear to be true for thermo-
chemical properties to which the EZPV contribution is smaller than for
the TAE (e.g. ionization potentials, electron aﬃnities, proton aﬃnities,
and the like).

3.

PERFORMANCE OF W1 AND W2 THEORIES

A reliable assessment of the performance of a method in the kJ/mol
accuracy range is, by its very nature, only possible where experimental
data are themselves known to this accuracy.

3.1.

Atomization Energies (the W2-1 Set)

In the original W1/W2 paper [1], we selected a set of 28 ﬁrst-and
second-row molecules (which we shall call the W2-1 set) containing at
most three nonhydrogen atoms for which (a) the experimental total at-
omization energies
D0 are available to the highest possible accuracy
(preferably 0.1 kcal/mol); (b) no strong nondynamical correlation eﬀects
exist that would hinder the applicability of single-reference electron cor-
relation methods; (c) near-exact anharmonic values of EZPV are available
from either experimental anharmonicity constants or highly accurate ab
initio anharmonic force ﬁelds.

P

Results using W1 and W2 theories are shown in Table 2.1. For W2
theory we ﬁnd a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.23 kcal/mol, which
further drops to 0.18 kcal/mol when the NO, O2, and F2 molecules are
deleted (all of which have mild nondynamical correlation in common).
Our largest deviation is 0.70 kcal/mol. We can hence state that W2
meets our design goals.

Chapter 2

For W1 theory, MAD is increased to 0.37 kcal/mol (old SCF extrap-
olation) or 0.40 kcal/mol (new SCF extrapolation), with the maximum
error being 0.78 kcal/mol. This should be compared with a MAD of 1.25
kcal/mol for G2 theory, 0.89 kcal/mol for G3 theory, 0.88 kcal/mol for
CBS-Q, and 0.61 kcal/mol for CBS-QB3, and the much higher maximum
errors of these methods of 4.90 kcal/mol (SO2), 3.80 kcal/mol (SO2),
3.10 kcal/mol (OCS), and 1.90 kcal/mol (OCS), respectively. While we
would prefer to use W2 theory for no-nonsense benchmarking if at all
possible, W1 theory still seems to oﬀer great advantages over the other
techniques.

3.2.

Electron Aﬃnities (the G2/97 Set)

Some representative results can be found in Table 2.2. For the
G2-1 set of electron aﬃnities, W1 theory has a mean absolute error of
0.016 eV [26]. Not unexpectedly – given the slow basis set convergence
of electron aﬃnities – the extra eﬀort invested in W2 theory pays oﬀ
with a further reduction of the mean absolute error to 0.012 eV. Accu-
racy appears to be limited principally by imperfections in the CCSD(T)
method: for the atoms B–F and Al–Cl, using even larger basis sets we
achieve 0.009 eV at the CCSD(T) level, which decreases to 0.001 eV if
approximate full CI energies are used.

Normally W1 theory does not involve diﬀuse functions on H, Li, Na,
Be, and Mg; not surprisingly, this leads to very poor electron aﬃnities
for Li and Na. Upon switching to W1aug (i.e. using augmented basis
sets on all elements), perfect agreement with experiment is obtained.
Within the G2-2 set, substantial discrepancies between W1 theory and
experiment are found for O3 and CH2NC, both of which are systems
with pronounced multireference character. (The same remark applies
to a lesser extent to FO.) Scalar relativistic eﬀects almost invariably
decrease the electron aﬃnity. Neglect of spin-orbit splitting leads to
signiﬁcant deterioration in MAD.

3.3.

Ionization Potentials (the G2/97 Set)

Some representative results can again be found in Table 2.2. At the
W1 level, the G2-1 ionization potentials are reproduced with a MAD of
only 0.013 eV [26]. No further improvement is seen at the W2 level
for this property. Note that if the B3LYP/VTZ geometry for CH+
4 is
employed, a serious error is seen for IP(CH4) which disappears when a
CCSD(T)/VTZ reference geometry is used instead. (Only BH & HLYP

into which inner-shell electrons can be excited. Again, inclusion of spin-
orbit splitting is worthwhile.

3.4.

Heats of Formation (the G2/97 Set)

A detailed discussion and a table can be found in Ref. 26. First
of all, we note that the mean uncertainty for the experimental values
in the G2-1 set is itself 0.6 kcal/mol. MAD values for W1 and W2
theory stand at 0.6 and 0.5 kcal/mol, respectively, suggesting that these
theoretical methods have a reliability comparable to the experimental
data themselves.

For a subset of 27 G2-2 molecules with fairly small experimental
uncertainties, W1 theory had MAD of 0.7 kcal/mol, compared to the
average experimental uncertainty of 0.4 kcal/mol. Some systems exhibit
deviations from experiment in excess of 1 kcal/mol: in the cases of BF3
and CF4, very slow basis set convergence is responsible, and W2 calcula-
tions in fact remove nearly all remaining disagreement with experiment
for the latter system. (The best available value for BF3 is itself a the-
oretical one, so a comparison would involve circular reasoning.) Other
molecules (NO2 and ClNO) suﬀer from severe multireference eﬀects.

3.5.

Proton Aﬃnities

For proton aﬃnities, W1 theory can basically be considered con-
verged [26]. The W2 computed values are barely diﬀerent from their
W1 counterparts, and the latter’s MAD of 0.43 kcal/mol is well below
the about 1 kcal/mol uncertainty in the experimental values. W1 theory
would appear to be the tool of choice for the generation of benchmark
proton aﬃnity data for calibration of more approximate approaches.

4.

VARIANTS AND SIMPLIFICATIONS

4.1.

W1′ Theory

It was noted that the original W1 theory (old-style SCF extrapola-
tion) performed considerably more poorly for second-row than for ﬁrst-
row species. This was ascribed to the lack of balance in the basis sets for
second-row atoms used in the SCF and valence correlation steps of W1;
in particular, the A′VTZ+2d1f basis set contains as many ”tight” d and
f functions as regular ones, which would appear to be a bit top-heavy.

W1 and W2 theories

51

It was proposed to replace the A′VTZ+2d1f basis set by A′VTZ+2d, a
conclusion borne out by calculations on the SO3 molecule [28], which
suﬀers from extreme inner polarization eﬀects and as such provides a
good ”proving ground”.

Compared to its prototype, the modiﬁcation (the so-called W1′
theory) did appear to yield improved results for second-row molecules.
However, in the W1/W2 validation study [26] we found this to be an
artifact of the exaggerated sensitivity of the (old-style) 3-point geometric
SCF extrapolation. Use of the new-style E∞+A/L5 extrapolation largely
eliminates both the problem and the diﬀerence between W1 and W1′
theory.

4.2.

W1h and W2h Theories

While the need for diﬀuse-function augmented basis sets for highly
electronegative elements is well established (e.g. [34]), it could be ar-
gued that they are not really required on group III and IV elements.
For organic-type molecules in particular, this would result in signiﬁcant
savings.

We deﬁne here W1h and W2h theories, respectively, as the modiﬁ-
cations of W1 theory for which AVnZ basis sets are only used on elements
of groups V, VI, VII, and VIII, but regular VnZ basis sets on groups
I, II, III, and IV. (The ”h” stands for ”heteroatom”, as we originally
investigated this for organic molecules.) For the purpose of the present
paper, we have repeated the validation calculations described in the pre-
vious section for W1h and W2h theories. (For about half of the systems,
W1 and W1h are trivially equivalent.) Some representative results can
be found in Table 2.1 for atomization energies/heats of formation, and
in Table 2.2 for ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities.

For the heats of formation in the G2-1 set, the largest diﬀerence
between W1 and W1h theory is 0.3 kcal/mol for Si2; the average diﬀer-
ence is less than 0.1 kcal/mol. For some of the systems in the G2-2 set,
however, diﬀerences are more pronounced, e.g. 0.6 kcal/mol for CF4 and
0.8 kcal/mol for benzene. (Note that the benzene calculation reported as
an example application in the original W1 paper [1] is in fact a W1h cal-
culation: the remaining small diﬀerence between that reference and the
present work is due to the diﬀerent SCF extrapolations used.) For the
G2-1 heats of formation, W2h and W2 are essentially indistinguishable
in quality, as could reasonably be expected.

For the G2-1 ionization potentials, the largest diﬀerences are 0.005
and 0.006 eV, respectively, for ethylene and acetylene. Diﬀerences in
the G2-2 set are likewise small, although Si2H2 (0.009 eV) and CH3OF

52

Chapter 2

(0.024 eV) stand out. Clearly W1h is of a quality comparable to W1 for
ionization potentials, and we recommend it as a moderately inexpensive
high-accuracy method for this property. (As noted before, W2 does not
represent an improvement over W1 for ionization potentials, and the
same goes for W2h theory.)

For electron aﬃnities, the diﬀerences between W1h and W1 are very
pronounced, and become (as expected) particularly large (e.g. 0.284 eV
in CH3) for species where none of the atoms carry diﬀuse functions in
W1h theory. The diﬀerences between W2 and W2h theory are still quite
sizable, and in fact agreement with experiment for W2h is inferior to that
for the less expensive W1 method. In summary, we do not recommend
W1h or W2h for electron aﬃnities.

4.3.

A Bond-Equivalent Model for Inner-Shell Correlation

In a pilot W1h calculation on benzene [1], it was found that 85 % of
the CPU time was spent on the inner-shell correlation step. Given that
this contribution is about 0.5 % of the TAE of benzene, the CPU time
proportion appears to be lopsided to say the least. On the other hand, a
contribution of 7 kcal/mol clearly cannot be neglected by any reasonable
standard. However, inner-shell correlation is by its very nature a much
more local phenomenon than valence correlation, and a relative error
of a few percent in such a small contribution is more tolerable than a
corresponding error in the major contributions, Martin, Sundermann,
Fast and Truhlar (MSFT) [43] investigated the applicability of a bond
equivalent model.

We started by generating a data base of inner-shell correlation con-
tributions for some 130 molecules that cover the ﬁrst two rows of the pe-
riodic table. In order to reduce the number of parameters in the model to
be ﬁtted, we introduced a Mulliken-type approximation for the parame-
ters DAB ≈ (DA+DB)/2. Furthermore we did retain diﬀerent parameters
for single and multiple bonds, but assumed DA≡B ≈ (3/2)DA=B.

The model (which requires essentially no CPU time) was found
to work very satisfactorily;
its performance for the W2-1 set can be
seen in Table 2.3. Somewhat to our surprise, we found that the same
model performs reasonably well when applied to the scalar relativistic
contributions, albeit with larger individual deviations.

It was recently suggested by Nicklass and Peterson [60] that the
use of core polarization potentials (CPPs) [61] could be an inexpensive
and eﬀective way to account for the eﬀects of inner shell correlation.
The great potential advantage of this indeed rather inexpensive method
over the MSFT bond-equivalent model is that it does not depend on

any explicit connectivity information. The diﬀerent approximate treat-
ments of inner-shell correlation are compared with large-scale CCSD(T)
results for the W2-1 set in Table 2.3. As seen there, while the CPP ap-
proach is indeed quite promising (clearly superior to MP2 calculations,
for instance), it clearly requires further reﬁnement. The MSFT bond-
equivalent model in fact outperforms all other approximate methods,
with a computational cost that is essentially nil.

4.4.

Reduced-Cost Approaches to the Scalar Relativistic
Correction

The fact that the additivity model for the scalar relativistic correc-
tion worked at all is a pleasant surprise: yet alternatives clearly merit
exploration. As noted above, the SCF-level scalar relativistic contri-
butions of Kedziora et al. [62] are systematically overestimated. One
possibility which suggests itself then would be applying a scaling factor
to the SCF values: we have considered this approach for the set of 120
molecules for which ACPF/MTsmall data were generated by MSFT for
the purposes of parameterizing their empirical model. However, rather
than following the more elaborate approach of Kedziora et al., we sim-
ply evaluated the ﬁrst-order Darwin and mass velocity corrections by
perturbation theory. We considered variation of the basis set, and found
not surprisingly that typical contracted VnZ basis sets are insuﬃciently
ﬂexible in the core region. We found VTZuc+1 (where VTZuc stands for
an uncontracted cc-pVTZ basis set) to be the best compromise between
cost and quality.

The best scale factor in the least-squares sense is 0.788; while the
mean absolute error of 0.04 kcal/mol is more than acceptable, the max-
imum absolute error of 0.20 kcal/mol (for SO2) is somewhat disappoint-
ing. Representative results (for the W2-1 set) can be found in Table
2.4.

This error can be considerably reduced, at very little cost, by em-
ploying B3LYP density functional theory instead of SCF. The scale fac-
tor, 0.896, is much closer to unity, and both mean and maximum abso-
lute errors are cut in half compared to the scaled SCF level corrections.
(The largest errors in the 120-molecule data set are 0.10 kcal/mol for P2
and 0.09 kcal/mol for BeO.) It could in fact be argued that the remain-
ing discrepancy between the scaled B3LYP/cc-pVTZuc+1 values is on
the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty in the ACPF/MTsmall
values themselves.

W1c Theory

Chapter 2

Here we propose a new reduced-cost variant of W1 theory which we
shall denote W1c (for ”cheap”), with W1ch theory being derived anal-
ogously from W1h theory. Speciﬁcally, the core correlation and scalar
relativistic steps are replaced by the approximations outlined in the pre-
vious two sections, i.e. the MSFT bond additivity model for inner-shell
correlation and scaled B3LYP/cc-pVTZuc+1 Darwin and mass-velocity
corrections. Representative results (for the W2-1 set) can be seen in
Table 2.1; complete data for the molecules in the G2-1 and G2-2 sets are
available through the World Wide Web as supplementary material [63]
to the present paper.

As seen in Table 2.1, W1c is an acceptable ”fallback solution” for
systems for which W1 calculations are not feasible because of the number
of inner-shell orbitals; for heats of formation and certainly for ionization
potentials, W1ch oﬀers a signiﬁcant further cost reduction over W1h at
a negligible loss in accuracy.

4.6.

Detecting Problems

While CCSD and especially CCSD(T) are known [36] to be less
sensitive to nondynamical correlation eﬀects than low-order perturba-
tion theoretical methods, some sensitivity remains, and deterioration of
W1 and W2 results is to be expected for systems that exhibit severe
nondynamical correlation character. A number of indicators exist for
this, such as the T1 diagnostic of Lee and Taylor [64], the size of the
largest amplitudes in the converged CCSD wavefunction, and natural
orbital occupations of the frontier orbitals.

One pragmatic criterion which we have found to be very useful is
the percentage of the TAE that gets recovered at the SCF level. For
systems that are wholly dominated by dynamical correlation, like CH4
and H2, this proportion exceeds 80 %, while it drops to 50 % for the
N2 molecule, O2 is only barely bound at the SCF level, and F2 is even
metastable. In the W1/W2 validation paper [26], we invariably found
that large deviations from what appeared to be reliable experimental
data tend to be associated with strong nondynamical correlation, and a
small SCF component of TAE (e.g. 27 % for NO2, 32 % for F2O, and
15 % for ClO).

Would the use of full CCSDT [65] energies, instead of their quasi-
perturbative-triples CCSD(T) counterparts, solve the problem? Our
experience has taught us that this generally leads to a deterioration of
the results; it has been shown (e.g. [66]) that the excellent performance

W1 and W2 theories

57

of CCSD(T) for binding energies is at least in part due to error compen-
sation between partial neglect of higher-order T3 eﬀects and complete
neglect of T4 eﬀects. Unfortunately, explicit treatment of T4 (connected
quadruple excitations) is at present not feasible for practical-sized sys-
tems.

For some very small systems (e.g. Be2 [67] and OH/OH− [68]), we
have considered what one might term W1CAS and W2CAS, in which
the CCSD(T) calculations were replaced by full valence (or larger) CAS-
ACPF calculations. The SCF extrapolation was then applied to the
CASSCF (i.e. Hartree-Fock plus static correlation) energy, and the
CCSD/CCSD(T) extrapolation to the dynamical correlation energy only.
Aside from limited applicability due to the explosive increase in the num-
ber of reference conﬁgurations with the number of atoms, the formal
objection of course applies that any separation between ”internal” and
”external” orbital spaces is to a large extent arbitrary.

Common sense also suggests that the larger the ”gap” being bridged
by the extrapolation from the actual computed number with the largest
basis set to the hypothetical basis set limit, the larger the uncertainty
in the latter will be. (See the example of benzene in section 5.3.)

Finally, the GIGO (”garbage in, garbage out”) theorem applies here
as well as in any other matter. For instance, if a B3LYP/cc-pVTZ+1
reference geometry is used for a system where the B3LYP geometry
is known to be qualitatively wrong (such as CH+
4 ), the computed W1
energetics will not be very reliable either.

EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS

5.1.

Heats of Vaporization of Boron and Silicon

First-principle computation of gas-phase molecular heats of forma-
tion by deﬁnition requires the gas-phase heats of formation of the ele-
ments:

∆H◦

f,T(XkYl · · ·) − k ∆H◦

f,T(X) − l ∆H◦
= ET(XkYl · · ·) + RT (1 − k − l − · · ·) − k ET(X) − l ET(Y) − · · · .
(5.1)

f,T(Y) − · · ·

Somewhat disappointingly, the values of ∆H◦

f [A(g)] of some ﬁrst-
and second-row elements A (notably boron and silicon) are not precisely
known because of a variety of experimental diﬃculties. However, well-
established precise heats of formation of BF3(g) [69] and SiF4 [70] are

58

Chapter 2

available that do not involve the heats of vaporization of boron and sili-
con in their determination. Thus, if accurate computed TAE0 values of
BF3 and SiF4 were available, then, in combination with the established
value [71] of D0(F2), the quantities sought for could be derived from a
thermochemical cycle. These were obtained by means of W2 theory for
BF3 [72] and for SiF4 [73]. The ﬁnal recommended values are ∆H◦
f,0[B(g)]
= 135.1±0.75 kcal/mol and ∆H◦
f,0[Si(g)] = 107.15±0.38 kcal/mol. The
boron value is about 2 kcal/mol higher than the CODATA recommended
value and in between a recent evaluation by Hildenbrand [74] and a 1977
measurement by Storms and Mueller [75]. The silicon value is slightly
higher than the CODATA recommended value, and with a much smaller
uncertainty. We note in passing that one of the ﬁrst arguments for revi-
sion of ∆H◦
f,0[Si(g)] was given in [76] on computational
(CBS-Q) grounds.

f,0[B(g)] and ∆H◦

5.2.

Validating DFT Methods for Transition States:
the Walden Inversion

It is well known (e.g. [77, 78]) that the prediction of reaction barrier
heights is one of the main ”Achilles’ heels” of density functional theory.
For instance [79], for the prototype SN 2 reaction,
X− + CH3Y → CH3X + Y− ,

(5.2)

B3LYP predicts a negative overall barrier if X = Y = Cl (i.e. a barrier
between the entry and exit ion-molecule complexes that lies below the
entrance channel). Adamo and Barone [79] demonstrated that their
new mPW1PW91 (modiﬁed Perdew-Wang) functional at least yields
the correct sign for this problem.

In Ref. 80 we carried out a W1 and W2 investigation for all six cases
with X,Y∈{F, Cl, Br}, in order to assess the performance of a number
of DFT exchange-correlation functionals. W2 is in excellent agreement
with experiment where reliable experimental data are available; in some
other cases, the W1 calculations either suggest revisions or provide the
only reliable data available (see Ref. 80 for details).

Of the diﬀerent exchange-correlation functionals considered, the
new mPW1K [59] functional of Truhlar and coworkers appears to yield
the best performance among ”hybrid” functionals (i.e. those including
a fraction of exact exchange), followed by BH&HLYP (a half-and-half
mixture [58] of Hartree-Fock and Becke 1988 exchange [81] with Lee-
Yang-Parr correlation). Among ”pure DFT” functionals, the best per-
formance is delivered by HCTH-120 [82] (the 120-molecule reparameter-
ization of the Hamprecht-Cohen-Tozer-Handy functional). (We note in

W1 and W2 theories

59

passing that this latter functional was parameterized entirely against ab
initio data.) The G2 data of Pross et al. [83], despite some quantitative
discrepancies, is qualitatively in perfect agreement with W1 theory.

We also note that in one case (F, Br) it was impossible to obtain
all required stationary points at the B3LYP level, since the F· · ·CH3Br
minimum does not show up at all at this level. Only mPW1K and
BH&HLYP ﬁnd this stationary point, as does CCSD(T).

5.3.

Benzene as a ”Stress Test” of the Method

As an illustrative example of ”stress-testing” W1 and W2 theory, we
shall consider the benzene molecule[86]. The most accurate calculation
we were able to carry out is at the W2h level: the rate-determining step
was the direct CCSD/cc-pV5Z calculation (30 electrons correlated, 876
basis functions, carried out in the D2h subgroup of D6h) which took
nearly two weeks on an Alpha EV67/667 MHz CPU. Relevant results
are collected in Table 2.5.

At ﬁrst sight, the disagreement between the computed W2h value of
∆H◦
f,0K = 23.0 kcal/mol and the experimental value of 24.0±0.2 kcal/mol
seems disheartening. (Note that it ”errs” on the other side as the most
recent previous benchmark calculation [53], 24.7±0.3 kcal/mol, using
similar-sized basis sets as W1 theory.) However, the comparison with
experiment is not entirely ”fair” since it neglects the experimental un-
certainties in the atomic heats of formation required to convert an at-
omization energy into a heat of formation (or vice versa). Combining
these with the experimental ∆H◦
f,0K leads to an experimentally derived
TAE0 = 1305.7 ± 0.7 kcal/mol, where the uncertainty is dominated by
six times that in the heat of vaporization of graphite. In other words,
our calculated TAE0 = 1306.7 kcal/mol is only 0.3 kcal/mol removed
from the upper end of the experimental uncertainty interval. (After all,
an error of 0.02 % seems to be a bit much to ask for.)

Secondly, let us consider the ”gaps” bridged by the extrapolations.
For the SCF component, that gap is a very reasonable 0.3 kcal/mol
(0.03 %), but for the CCSD valence correlation component this rises to
5 kcal/mol (1.7 %) while for the connected triple excitations contribution
it amounts to 1 kcal/mol (3.7 % — note however that a smaller basis
set is being used than for CCSD). It is clear that the extrapolations are
indispensable to obtain even a useful result, let alone an accurate one,
even with such large basis sets.

Inner-shell correlation, at 7 kcal/mol, is of quite nontrivial impor-
tance, but even scalar relativistic eﬀects (at 1 kcal/mol) cannot be ig-

vibrational energy would be unacceptable.

Let us now consider the more approximate results. While W1h
coincidentally agrees to better than 0.2 kcal/mol with the W2h result,
W1 deviates from the latter by 0.6 kcal/mol. Note, however, that in
W1h theory, the extrapolations bridge gaps of 0.8 (SCF), 10.1 (CCSD),
and 2.1 (T) kcal/mol, the corresponding amounts for W1 theory being
0.7, 9.1, and 1.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Common sense suggests that
if extrapolations account for 13.0 (W1h) and 11.7 (W1) kcal/mol, then
a discrepancy of 1 kcal/mol should not come as a surprise — in fact,
the relatively good agreement between the two sets of numbers and the
more rigorous W2h result (total extrapolation: 6.3 kcal/mol) testiﬁes, if
anything, to the robustness of the method.

W1 and W2 theories

61

As for the diﬀerence of about 0.4 kcal/mol between the old-style
and new-style SCF extrapolations in W1h and W1 theories, comparison
with the W2h SCF limits clearly suggests the new-style extrapolation
to be the more reliable one. (The two extrapolations yield basically the
same result in W2h.) This should not be seen as an indication that the
E∞ + A/L5 formula is somehow better founded theoretically, but rather
as an example of why reliance on (aug-)cc-pVDZ data should be avoided
if at all possible. Users who prefer the geometric extrapolation for the
SCF component could consider carrying out a direct SCF calculation
in the ”extra large” (i.e. V5Z) basis set and applying the E∞ + A/BL
extrapolation to the ”medium”, ”large”, and ”extra large” SCF data.

CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS

W1/W2 theory and their variants would appear to represent a valu-
able addition to the computational chemist’s toolbox, both for applica-
tions that require high-accuracy energetics for small molecules and as a
potential source of parameterization data for more approximate meth-
ods. The extra cost of W2 theory (compared to W1 theory) does appear
to translate into better results for heats of formation and electron aﬃni-
ties, but does not appear to be justiﬁed for ionization potentials and
proton aﬃnities, for which the W1 approach yields basically converged
results. Explicit calculation of anharmonic zero-point energies (as op-
posed to scaling of harmonic ones) does lead to a further improvement in
the quality of W2 heats of formation; at the W1 level, the improvement
is not suﬃciently noticeable to justify the extra expense and diﬃculty.
Of the various reduced-cost variants introduced in this paper, W2h
performs basically as accurately as to W2 for heats of formation. Like-
wise, W1h is essentially as good as W1 theory for ionization potentials,
and almost as good for heats of formation. Neither method is recom-
mended for electron aﬃnities.

In systems where a large number of inner-shell electrons makes the
inner-shell correlation (and, to a lesser extent, scalar relativistic) steps
in W1 and W2 theory unfeasible, the use of a bond equivalent model
for the inner-shell correlation and scaled B3LYP/cc-pVTZuc+1 scalar
relativistic corrections oﬀers an alternative under the name of W1c and
W1ch theories.

One plan for the future is the extension to heavier element systems;
the ﬁrst step in this direction has been made recently with the devel-
opment of the SDB-cc-pVnZ valence basis sets [84] (for use with the

62

Chapter 2

Stuttgart-Dresden-Bonn relativistic ECPs [85]) for third- and fourth-
row main group elements.

Further improvement of accuracy, as well as applicability to sys-
tems exhibiting nondynamical correlation, will almost certainly require
some level of treatment of connected quadruple excitations.

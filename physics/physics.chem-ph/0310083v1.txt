To examine the validity of the reaction-diﬀusion equation at a low density of molecules, we have
investigated eﬀects of the spatial discreteness of molecules in reaction-diﬀusion systems, adopting
stochastic particle simulations.
It is found that the discreteness within the so called Kuramoto
length may cause localization of molecules, resulting in novel steady states that do not exist in
reaction-diﬀusion equations. Relevance of this discreteness-induced state to biological intracellular
processes is also discussed.

There is a variety of systems that can be studied as
chemical reaction and diﬀusion processes. In particular,
biological systems consist of reactions of a huge number
of chemicals and the diﬀusion of such molecules.

To study reaction-diﬀusion processes numerically,
(partial) diﬀerential equations (reaction-diﬀusion equa-
tions) are often employed.
In such equations, it is as-
sumed that the amount of each chemical is suﬃciently
large. In biochemical processes with a large number of
chemical species, however, it is unlikely that the amount
of each chemical is always large [1, 2]. Some chemicals
may be rare in the system. In such a situation, the ﬂuc-
tuations in the concentrations of chemicals cannot be ig-
nored. Actually, some eﬀects of ﬂuctuations on pattern
formation are found in reaction-diﬀusion systems (see
e.g., [3, 4]). Stochastic diﬀerential equations are often
used to study possible eﬀect of such ﬁnite-size ﬂuctua-
tions.

Of course, the chemicals are composed of molecules,
and the reactions occur between the molecules. The
numbers of molecules or reaction events must be inte-
ger, which change only discretely.
In stochastic diﬀer-
ential equations, the ﬂuctuations are regarded as con-
tinuous changes, despite the fact that the ﬂuctuations
are based on the stochastic changes between the discrete
states. When some chemicals are very rare, though, the
discreteness of molecules itself cannot be ignored. The
continuous approximation of the states in stochastic dif-
ferential equations may no longer be appropriate.

Concerning the discreteness, we previously studied its
eﬀect in simple autocatalytic reaction network systems,
to report discreteness-induced transitions, as well as dras-
tic change of concentrations with the decrease of the
number of existing molecules [5, 6].
In these studies,
we assume reactions in a well-stirred medium, where the
discreteness in molecule numbers concerns with that in a
given system or ﬂow into it.

Contrastingly, in a system with diﬀusion in space, the
total number of molecules over the whole space should be
large as the system size is large. By assuming that the

reaction is fast and the diﬀusion is slow, however, local
discreteness of molecules may be important, even if the
total number of molecules is large. The discreteness in
concern should be related with the number only within
some scale of the system. We need to deﬁne such a scale,
so that the discreteness in the molecule number within
the size of the scale is crucial to establish the continuum
limit.

To consider this problem, the ratio between the reac-
tion and diﬀusion rates is important. As a candidate for
the scale, we recall that the typical distance over which
a molecule diﬀuses during its lifetime, i.e., before it un-
dergoes reaction, is deﬁned by Kuramoto [7, 8]. For ref-
erence, let us brieﬂy review the work.

Consider the reaction [10]

If the concentration of chemical A is set to be constant,
the chemical X is produced at the constant rate k, while
B at the rate k′. The
it decays with the reaction 2X
average concentration of X at the steady state is
=
pkA/2k′, where A is the concentration of the chemical
A. Thus the average lifetime of X at the steady state is

typical length over which an X molecule diﬀuses in its
lifetime is estimated to be

l = √2Dτ ,

which is called Kuramoto length, according to van Kam-
pen [9].

The Kuramoto length l represents the relation between
the rate of reaction and that of diﬀusion. When the sys-
tem size (length) is smaller than l, its behavior is domi-
nated by the diﬀusion. Local ﬂuctuations rapidly spread
over the system. Contrastingly, if the system size is much
larger than l, the ﬂuctuation is localized only in a small
part of the system, and distant regions ﬂuctuate inde-
pendently.

dard deviation between the trials). The dotted lines corre-
spond to 0.1 molecule per the Kuramoto length l1 = pD/50r
for each r.

In these works, it is assumed that the average dis-
tance between molecules is much smaller than l. Thus
the actual discreteness of molecules is ignored, and the
concentration of the chemical X can be regarded as a
continuous variable. However, if the average distance be-
tween molecules is comparable to or larger than l, local
discreteness of molecules may not be negligible. Suppose
a chemical A, with very low concentration, produces an-
other chemical B. The average lifetime of B is short,
such that the Kuramoto length of B is shorter than the
average distance between A molecules. With this set-
ting, chemical B may be localized around A molecules.
Especially, in reactions with 2nd or higher order of B,
localization of chemical B may drastically alter the total
rate of the reactions, and the eﬀect of local discreteness
of molecules may be important.

Now we will demonstrate the eﬀect of the local
discreteness of molecules, by taking a simple one-
dimensional reaction-diﬀusion system with 3 chemicals

measure the actual acceleration factor from our simulation
with diﬀerent reaction constants (dotted line), which almost
meets the above expected value (r = 0.1, D = 100, N = 1000,

where Di is the diﬀusion constant of Xi. The system is
closed and thus the total concentration c is conserved.
For simplicity, we assume Di = D for all i.

The reaction-diﬀusion equation has ﬁxed points at
(c1, c2, c3) = (0, 0, c), (2c/3, c/3, 0) for all x. By perform-
ing a straightforward linear stability analysis, it is shown
that only the former is stable. Indeed, by starting from
the initial condition with ci > 0, this reaction-diﬀusion
equation always converges to the ﬁxed point (0, 0, c).

Now we consider seriously the eﬀect of the discrete-
ness of molecules, for which we carry out direct particle
simulations. Each molecule diﬀuses randomly (showing
Brownian motion) in a one-dimensional space with pe-
riodic boundary (length Lx). When two molecules are
within the distance dr, it is judged whether they react
each other or not. Here, the total number of molecules
(N ) is conserved.

We ﬁrst investigate the change of Ni, the total num-
ber of Xi. Time series of Ni is shown in Fig. 1. N1
and N2 converge not to 0 but relatively large numbers.
The remaining N2 changes with r and D, as shown in
Fig. 2. Approximately, it is proportional to pr/D when

To elucidate the origin of this proportionality, we adopt
the Kuramoto length, which, of course, depends on the
molecule species. We focus on the Kuramoto length for
X1 molecules, which is given by l1 = pD/50rc3, consid-
ering that the average lifetime of X1 is 1/100rc3. Here

Using this length l1, the density of the remaining X2
molecules is found to be about 0.1 molecule per l1, in-
dependent of the parameters, as shown in Fig. 2. After
relaxation, this density does not depend on the initial
condition, as long as Ni
1 is satisﬁed initially. Further-
more, the density is independent of the system size Lx, if

is simply proportional to Lx. Accordingly, the obtained
density, which is independent of initial condition and the
system size, diﬀers from the continuum limit.

Consider the case that N2 is large, i.e., λ2 is small, so
that α is smaller than 4. Then, the ampliﬁcation factor
is smaller than unity, and accordingly N2 decreases. On
the other hand, as N2 is small to make α larger than 4,
N2 increases. Following eq. (2), the two reaction rates
are balanced if N2 takes a value such that α = 4 is sat-
isﬁed. Hence, N2 is attracted to such a value that α = 4
is satisﬁed, and is kept around it. The steady state with
this nonzero average concentration c2 satisfying the re-
lationship α = 4 is distinct from the ﬁxed point of the
reaction-diﬀusion equation, (0, 0, c).
From the estimation above (eq.

ﬁxed point of the reaction-diﬀusion equation, (2c/3, c/3,

The localization of X1 cannot be maintained without
the spatial discreteness of X2 molecules.
In reaction-
diﬀusion equations, any patterns disappear with tem-
poral evolution, unless suitably sustained through reac-
tions. Even if the initial distribution of X2 is discrete,
it is rapidly homogenized. In reality, a single molecule
itself can no longer be broadened by diﬀusion, and thus
the spatial discreteness of X2 molecules is maintained. In
other words, a molecule is a diﬀusion-resistant pattern.
The alteration of the steady state by the localization is
not limited to this kind of the present reaction network.
Provided that the conditions

(i) Chemical A generates another chemical B.

(ii) The lifetime of B is short or the diﬀusion of B is
slow so that the Kuramoto length of B is much
smaller than the distance between A molecules.

(iii) The localization of the molecule B accelerates some

reactions.

are satisﬁed, the present discreteness eﬀect is expected.
The last condition is easily satisﬁed if second or higher
order reaction is involved in the species B, while there
can be several other possibilities for it.

In so far as these conditions are met, our result does
not depend on the details of the reactions, and may be
general for reaction-diﬀusion systems.
If the reactions
are appropriately designed, the result may be veriﬁed
experimentally. Microreactors or vesicles may be good
candidates for such experiments.

In biological cells, lots of chemicals are at low con-
centration, at the order of 1 nM or less. The diﬀusion
is sometimes restricted by surrounding macro-molecules,
and may be slow. In such an environment, it is proba-
ble that the average distance between the molecules of a
given chemical species is much larger than the Kuramoto
lengths of some other chemical species. Biochemical sys-
tems contain various higher order reactions (for example,
catalyzed by enzyme complexes) and positive feedback
mechanisms, that might naturally support the condition
(iii) above.

In membranes, the diﬀusion is limited within a two-
dimension space. Moreover, the structure of biological
membranes has multiple scales, and the eﬀective diﬀusion
constant of embedded molecules may depend on the scale
of observation. With such structures, it is important
whether the size of the structure is larger or smaller than
the actual Kuramoto length of the embedded molecules.
Also, the diﬀusion constant of the molecules depends
on the scale of observation, so that the relation may be
quite complicated. It is then possible that some chem-
ical species restricted in a speciﬁc structure eﬀectively

react together. Summing up, it is expected that the spa-
tial discreteness of molecules is important in intracellular
processes.

In our preliminary simulations of similar reaction-
diﬀusion systems, we have observed pattern formation
induced by the discreteness of molecules, that is not re-
produced by reaction-diﬀusion equations with or without
noise. This mechanism of pattern formation is expected
to be quite diﬀerent from that of Turing patterns.

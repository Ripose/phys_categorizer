We present results of theoretical study and numerical calculation of the dynamics of molecular
liquids based on combination of the memory equation formalism and the reference interaction site
model – RISM. Memory equations for the site-site intermediate scattering functions are studied in
the mode-coupling approximation for the ﬁrst order memory kernels, while equilibrium properties
such as site-site static structure factors are deduced from RISM. The results include the temperatu-
re-density(pressure) dependence of translational diﬀusion coeﬃcients D and orientational relaxation
times τ for acetonitrile in water, methanol in water and methanol in acetonitrile, all in the limit of
inﬁnite dilution. Calculations are performed over the range of temperatures and densities employing
the SPC/E model for water and optimized site-site potentials for acetonitrile and methanol. The
theory is able to reproduce qualitatively all main features of temperature and density dependences
of D and τ observed in real and computer experiments. In particular, anomalous behavior, i.e. the
increase in mobility with density, is observed for D and τ of methanol in water, while acetonitrile
in water and methanol in acetonitrile do not show deviations from the ordinary behavior. The
variety exhibited by the diﬀerent solute-solvent systems in the density dependence of the mobility
is interpreted in terms of the two competing origins of friction, which interplay with each other as
density increases: the collisional and dielectric frictions which, respectively, increase and decrease
with increasing density.

INTRODUCTION

The mobility of either polar molecules or small po-
lyatomic ions in dense dipolar liquids exhibits some
anomalies that have attracted considerable interest of
scientists1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.
In this paper we
pay attention to the study of the so-called “anomalous
pressure behavior” of polar binary molecular liquids by
considering such popular models as methanol in water,
acetonitrile in water and methanol in acetonitrile.
In
particular, we are interested in the density(pressure) de-
pendence of translational diﬀusion coeﬃcients and reori-
entation relaxation times of solutes. To begin with, we
would like to say ﬁrst few words about anomalies as they
are.

The very primitive (classical, not quantum) picture of
a molecular liquid could be the set of ﬁnite size struc-
tural particles – molecules – consisting of interacting
sites, which are connected by chemical bonds. Positions
of molecules as well as their orientations are not ﬁxed in
general and may vary randomly in time. The change may
be achieved either by translational or rotational motion.

Intuitively, it is then clear to understand that applying
the external pressure for such system results in making
the intermolecular distances shorter, which as the con-
sequence will limit the molecular mobility. In this case
one may expect a monotonous decrease with pressure for
such quantities as translational or rotational diﬀusion co-
eﬃcients. Limitation of the molecular mobility can also
be discussed in terms of some other dynamical charac-
teristics such as viscosity, dielectric relaxation, etc. This
point of view has been conﬁrmed experimentally for nu-
merous liquids and solutions16. At the same time, some
molecular liquids do not obey strictly this abstraction
and exhibit behavior which is diﬀerent from the intuitive
picture. Typical representatives of such molecular liquids
are water and some aqueous solutions17,18,19 whose mo-
bility with pressure can be enhanced. The enhancement
of the molecular (or ionic) mobility under pressure then
has been identiﬁed as the anomalous one.

Historically, ﬁrst attempts to explain dynamics of
molecules in solutions were based on the use of the so-
called continuum model for solvents20,21,22,23,24,25.
In
this model the surrounding medium is regarded as a di-

2

electric continuum extending up to the surface of the par-
ticle. The particle itself is treated as a rigid sphere of
ﬁnite size with some charge for ions or dipole moment
for molecules. Dynamic behavior of the media are de-
scribed by the Debye equation in terms of the frequency
dependent dielectric susceptibility, and hydrodynamic ef-
fects are entirely neglected. The most important contri-
bution of the theory was that it succeeded in extending
the phenomenological approaches to consider the friction
on a rotating dipole. When a dipole is surrounded by
a dielectric continuum, it polarizes the medium. If the
dipole rotates, the polarization should relax so that it
adjusts itself to the electric ﬁeld produced by the new
orientation of the dipole. The relaxation process is asso-
ciated with the energy dissipation which is identiﬁed as
the dielectric friction. Later the theory was improved by
obtaining velocity of ﬂuid from linearized Navier-Stokes
equation for a viscous incompressible ﬂuid with bound-
ary conditions of either perfect sticking or slipping at the
surface of the particle26,27,28. Subsequently, there were
many another suggestions on improvements of the theory,
the enhanced “continuum mechanical framework”
e.g.
description has been given in series of works29,30,31, where
dissipation function is constructed by adding the electri-
cal dissipation to the ordinary hydrodynamic one, etc.
However, contrary to what was expected, the contin-
uum model turned out to be unable to explain properly
numerous contradictions of phenomenological laws with
experimental data. One example is the failure of the
Stokes-Einstein relation in explaining the dependence of
In or-
mobility of ions in polar liquids on their size.
der to compromise the trouble it has been suggested to
use the so-called “eﬀective” radii of particles, or rewrite
the relation so that it appears in the fractional exponent
form32. Such kind of revisions had some eﬀects, but there
were also other diﬃculties which could not be resolved
in principle. For instance, dielectric continuum theories
cannot explain observed diﬀerence in mobility of anions
and cations because the interaction between an ion and
dielectric media does not depend on the sign of the ion
charge. That is enough to realize that the insolvency of
a conventional continuum model description can be over-
come only by a microscopic formulation of the problem.

The microscopic, or statistical-mechanical, theory of
molecular liquids is now on its rise, and the consider-
able progress has been achieved during last years both
in the description of equilibrium and non-equilibrium
properties33.
It became possible due to the aptly
used reference interaction site model – RISM34,35,36
and its modiﬁcations, or in the case of dynamics –
due to appropriate uniﬁcation of RISM and general-
ized Langevin equation (GLE) which is obtained in the
Mori formalism37,38. The choice in favor of generalized
Langevin equation is not accidental. For example, an al-
ternative way of describing non-equilibrium processes can
be based on the use of various types of kinetic equations
which are derived from the BBGKY hierarchy39. How-
ever, when it is applied to systems with high density,

there is an ambiguity in the construction of the collision
integral. Also the linearization procedure for the colli-
sion integral cannot be justiﬁed by the same arguments
which are used in the case of systems with low density40.
In Mori formalism such questions do not appear. GLE
describes the time evolution of several dynamic variables
in concern as a function of the representative point in
the phase space. All other variables which are not un-
der explicit concern are projected onto the dynamic vari-
ables of interest with the help of a projection operator.
The projection leads to an equation which looks similar
to the phenomenological Langevin equation containing
the frictional force proportional to the rate of change
of the dynamic variables, and the random force, which
are related to each other by the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem.
If one chooses as the dynamic variables the
density and the conjugated current of sites or atoms of
molecules in liquid, the theory gives a memory equa-
tion for the dynamic structure factor of atoms, which
describes the time evolution of the site-site density pair
correlation functions41. Initial values, i.e. site-site static
structure factors and direct correlation function which
are necessary to solve this integro-diﬀerential equation,
are obtained from the RISM or one of its generalizations.
A crucial development of the theory is rather conceptual,
not mathematical, in the sense that it has provided a new
concept to view dynamics of a molecule in solution, which
is quite diﬀerent from the model traditionally exploited
in the ﬁeld. The new model regards the molecular motion
in liquid as a correlated translational motion of atoms:
if two atoms in a diatomic molecule are moving in the
same direction, then the molecule as a whole is making
translational motion, while the molecule should be rotat-
ing if its atoms are moving in opposite directions. This
view diﬀers from the traditionally developed rotational-
translational model which is based on the use of angu-
lar coordinates42,43,44,45,46. Another important issue of
RISM-based theories, which should be mentioned here,
is that they pioneered in explaining the observed diﬀer-
ence in the behavior of anions and cations in solution.
Both equilibrium47 and non-equilibrium48 systems were
studied, and now we know that these diﬀerences should
be attributed to dissimilarities of the microscopic struc-
ture of solvent surrounding the ion.

The new theory of dynamic processes in molecular liq-
uids has been under development in last decade in works
by Hirata and Chong49,50 and get its extension in studies
by Hirata, Yamaguchi and others51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60.
Particularly, theoretical description of pressure depen-
dence of the molecular motion of liquid water and trans-
port properties of ionic liquids were subjects for inves-
tigation in recent papers by Yamaguchi et al.55,56.
In
present manuscript we continue this line and report our
latest study which is the pressure and temperature de-
pendence of dynamics of polar molecules in solution. The
In subsection II A
manuscript is organized as follows.
we write down equations of motion, which are memory
equations, for site-site intermediate scattering functions,

and give relations for translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient
and reorientation correlation time in terms of these func-
tions. In subsection II B we deal with equilibrium prop-
erties of the system which we obtain using DRISM with
hypernetted chain (HNC) type of the closure. In order
to solve a memory equation one needs to set the model
for memory kernels. This question is discussed in some
detail in subsection II C. More attention is paid to the
so-called mode-coupling approximation, which is used to
study dynamical behavior of the system in the long-time
scale. We apply our formalism to investigate some realis-
tic systems such as acetonitrile in water, methanol in wa-
ter and methanol in acetonitrile. Set up for these models
and details of numerical procedures in the computational
part of this work are brieﬂy explained in section III. Ob-
tained results and remedies are discussed in section IV,
and conclusions are given in section V.

II. THEORY

A. Memory equations for site-site intermediate scattering
functions

Time-correlation functions are convenient tools for de-
scribing properties of many-body systems and can direct-
ly be associated with experimental observables. A gene-
ral theoretical scheme for calculation of time-correlation
functions is provided by the Mori approach37,38, where
they are phrased in terms of memory function equations.
Hereafter we will follow the formalism by Hirata and
Chong50, which is the judicious uniﬁcation of the the-
ory of dynamical processes in simple liquids based on the
Mori approach37,38, and reference interaction site model
for molecular liquids34,35,36.
In this formalism “slow”
variables of the system are partial number densities and
longitudinal current densities. Then, of practical inter-
est are elements of the matrix of the site-site intermediate
scattering functions F(k; t) and the matrix of their self-
parts Fs(k; t) deﬁned by

concentration vanishes. One has two types of memory

Expressions for static site-site structure factors and
memory kernels are discussed separately in sections III
and IV, respectively. Here we show how quantities of our
interest in this paper, which are solute’s translational dif-
fusion coeﬃcient D and rank-1 reorientation correlation
u
s (k; t). The diﬀusion coef-
time τR1, are related with F
ﬁcient can be expressed in terms of the site-site veloc-
ity autocorrelation function, while the relaxation time is
integrated rank-1 reorientation autocorrelation function.
Both of them are described in terms of the F

B. Equilibrium properties of molecular liquids via
RISM/DRISM

Initial values of intermediate scattering functions, that
we need to solve memory equations (2.2), can be ob-
tained using the RISM theory33,34,35,36. It predicts static
structure of molecular ﬂuids via the calculation of site-
site pair correlation functions. This method has been
extensively used and proved to be the powerful tool in
the microscopic description of equilibrium quantities of
the system33.
In the present article, we employ the
DRISM version of the theory64,65 instead of the standard
RISM/HNC theory. The DRISM theory incorporates a
bridge function which is determined to reproduce the di-
electric constant of solvent in phenomenological fashion.
The use of the DRISM theory is known to improve the di-
electric loss spectrum of solvent quantitatively, although
it does not change the essential conclusion of the study
with respect to the pressure dependence of the dynamics
of solute in solvent57.

C. Mode-Coupling approximation for memory kernels

It makes sense to talk about translational diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient and reorientation relaxation time only when dy-
namics of the system is considered in the long-time limit,
i.e. when the time scale is large enough for fast relax-
ation processes to be completed. Memory kernel of the
memory equation in that case is usually constructed by
the so-called mode-coupling approximation63. In works
by Chong et al.66,67 the conventional mode-coupling the-
ory has been extended to the case of molecular liqu-
ids based on the interaction-site model.
In particular,
mode-coupling expressions for memory function matri-
ces, which we will denote as Kmc(k, t) and Ks,mc(k, t),
were obtained as bilinear combinations of site-site inter-
mediate scattering functions or their self parts as

here for simplicity the wave-vector k has been taken to be parallel to z-axis.
It has been shown, however, that
the proposed expressions for memory functions underestimate friction in orientational motions54. According to the
recipe by Yamaguchi and Hirata54, memory functions for the self-part should be given by the linear combination of

III. SETUP OF MODELS AND NUMERICAL
PROCEDURES

We performed explicit calculations for several popu-
lar systems, namely, acetonitrile (CH3CN) in water,
methanol (CH3OH) in water and methanol in acetoni-
trile, all
in the case of inﬁnite dilution. As for the
structure and the intermolecular potential of water we
employed a model of the extended simple point charge
(SPC/E)68. We also put the Lennard-Jones (LJ) core on
the hydrogen atoms in order to avoid the undesired diver-
gence of the solution of the RISM integral equation. The
LJ parameters of the hydrogen atom, the depth of the
well and the diameter, were chosen to be 0.046 kcal/mol
and 0.7 ˚A, respectively.

In acetonitrile and methanol the methyl group was con-

sidered to be a single interaction site (Me) located on the
methyl carbon atom. Consequently, all chemical com-
pounds consist of three sites which interact through the
pair potential69,70

From the memory equation / mode-coupling theory
and the DRISM/HNC integral equation theory, the diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients and the reorientation relaxation times of
solute molecules in solution can be obtained based solely
on the information about molecular shapes, inertia pa-
rameters, intermolecular interaction potentials, temper-
ature and density. First, we calculate the site-site static
structure factor by solving the DRISM equation using
the intermolecular interaction, molecular shape, tempe-
rature and density. In order to improve the convergence
of the DRISM calculation, we use the method of the
modiﬁed direct inversion in an iterative space (MDIIS)
proposed by Kovalenko et al.78 From the static site-site
structure factor, we calculate the site-site intermediate
scattering function using the site-site memory equation
with the mode-coupling approximation for the memory
kernels. The memory equation is time-integrated nume-
rically. Time-development of correlation functions in the
0 limit is treated separately by the analytical limi-
k
ting procedure of theoretical expressions. In the numeri-
cal procedure, the reciprocal space is linearly discretized
as k = (n + 1
1.
Values of ∆k and Nk are 0.061 ˚A−1 and 29 = 512, respec-
tively. The choice for Nk as the power of two is coming
as the requirement of the subroutine for the fast Fourier
transform, which is used in DRISM / MDIIS. The diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient D is calculated from the asymptotic slope
of the time dependence of the mean square displacement,
and the orientational relaxation time τ is deduced from
the rotational autocorrelation function.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Equilibrium properties: static structure

Since the discovery of anomalous behavior of the mo-
lecular mobility with pressure it has been attributed to
the hydrogen bonding properties of the system. The idea
is that the hydrogen bonds or hydrogen bonding net-
work are distorted upon compression, so that the dis-
solved molecule is actually having fewer hydrogen bonds
at higher pressure, thus making it easier to move and ro-
tate. The extensive test of this idea has been the objec-
tive of many researches. In particular, the time evolution
of the formation and rupture of hydrogen bonds turns

out to be a popular quantity to be examined in studies
based on the computer simulation (see, e.g., Ref. 79 and
references therein). In order to circumvent the problem,
a number of alternative deﬁnitions of hydrogen bonds
was suggested on top of the traditional one based either
on geometric80 and/or energetic81 criteria, though none
of them is conclusive. The deﬁnition of hydrogen bond
in the theoretical study based on the integral equation
is somewhat ambiguous as well. However, it is a quite
general observation for such liquids like water and alco-
hol that a pair of atoms having small size and/or large
charges with opposite sign makes a well-deﬁned ﬁrst peak
in the pair correlation function: for example, hydrogen
and oxygen in water and alcohol. Especially, in order
for making a hydrogen bond, one of the pair of atoms
should be as small as a hydrogen atom. Since those li-
quids are known to make a hydrogen bond between the
pair of atoms, the well-deﬁned peak has been assigned to
a “hydrogen bond”. The hydrogen bond between a pair
of atoms induces a “liquid structure” which is speciﬁc
to molecules consisting the ﬂuid, which in turn produces
peculiar peaks in the pair correlation function at parti-
cular distances. For example, in the case of water, the
1.8 ˚A in the O-H cor-
hydrogen bond peak appears at
relation function, which induces a new peak in the O-O
4.5 ˚A. The O-O distance is

Alcohol also makes a hydrogen bond between a pair of

network, which is distinct from water. Instead, it makes
zigzag chains of hydrogen bonds. It is because one of the
four hydrogen-bonding sites is replaced by an alkyl group
which is too large to form the bond. In the case of neat
acetonitrile, there is no indication for making hydrogen

function is determined essentially by the repulsive inter-
actions and the molecular geometry.

will make repulsive interactions more dominant, which
will weaken the hydrogen bond by distorting the favo-
rable arrangement between the two molecules. The pair
correlation functions on pressure or density should re-
ﬂect the interplay mentioned above. Increasing pressure
or density will result in reduction in all the indications of
hydrogen bonding and of the consequential liquid struc-
ture, and will make the steric or packing eﬀect more do-
minant.

Fig. 1 shows the site-site radial distribution functions
1.8 ˚A in
(RDF’s) for neat water. The sharp peak at
the O-H RDF, Fig. 1b), is that of the hydrogen bond
without any question. A weak but conspicuous second
4.5 ˚A in the O-O RDF, Fig. 1a), is indica-
peak at
tive of the tetrahedral conﬁguration characteristic in the

∼

∼

hydrogen-bond network in water. All the changes in the
RDF caused by increasing density coincide with the intu-
itive picture emerged from the disruption or distortion of
the hydrogen bond and its network: the reduction of the
hydrogen bond peak in the O-H RDF, the reduction of
the second peak in the O-O RDF. The increasing height
in the ﬁrst and third peaks in the O-O RDF implies the
enhanced tendency of the steric and packing eﬀect due
to the increased density.

Fig. 2 shows the site-site RDF for methanol in water.
There are two possible hydrogen bond sites in methanol,
O and H, which make hydrogen bonds, respectively with
H and O of water molecules. The O(water)-H(methanol)
RDF, Fig.
2b), has the hydrogen bond peak at the
position where that in neat water appears. The peak
height and resolution are less compared to the case in
neat water, implying the hydrogen bond is somewhat
weaker. The density dependence of the peak shows si-
milar behavior with that in neat water, indicating that
the hydrogen bond is weakened due to the steric dis-
tortion caused by pressure. The O(methanol)-H(water)
RDF, Fig. 2c), has the hydrogen bond peak at
1.5
˚A, which is much shorter than that in the O(water)-
H(methanol) RDF. The peak is even more sharply de-
ﬁned than that in neat water, implying that the hydro-

∼

gen bond is stronger. The density dependence of the
peak shows similar tendency with that in neat water,
but decreases more sharply with increasing density. The
O(water)-O(methanol) RDF, Fig. 1a), maintains the es-
sential structure which is seen in that of neat water. The
4.5 ˚A has
important point is that the second peak at
not disappeared, but is even enhanced, which indicates
the tetrahedral coordination peculiar to the hydrogen
bond network in water keeps its integrity. Indeed, in our
earlier work concerning the structure of the tert-butyl
alcohol-water mixture, we have clariﬁed that a butanol
molecule is incorporated in the hydrogen-bond network of
water in its inﬁnite dilution by forming hydrogen bonds
with surrounding solvent molecules82.

∼

The site-site RDF of the acetonitrile in water is shown
in Fig. 3 along with its density dependence. According to
the criteria for hydrogen bonding ability of atoms stated
above, the acetonitrile molecule has one possible hydro-
gen bond site, nitrogen N, which can act only as a pro-
ton acceptor. As is anticipated from the argument, the
N(acetonitrile)-H(water) RDF has a conspicuous hydro-
1.8 ˚A, which again decreases
gen bond peak at about
with increasing density, Fig. 3b). On the other hand,
the N(acetonitrile)-O(water) RDF shows less conspicu-
ous second peak at 4.5 ˚A, which implies that the hydro-
gen bond network of water is somewhat disturbed around
the solute compared to the neat solvent, Fig. 3a).

∼

In Fig. 4, shown is the site-site RDF for methanol in
acetonitrile at inﬁnite dilution.
In this case, a solvent
(acetonitrile) molecule can make a hydrogen bond with
the solute molecule only at the N-site by accepting the
proton from methanol. The ﬁrst peak in Fig. 4b) is
indicative of the hydrogen bond. The solvent molecules
do not make any hydrogen bond among themselves. The
N-site never forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen site
of methanol. It is not only because the both sites have
negative charges, but also because the neither of them
is as small as hydrogen. Therefore, the N(acetonitrile)-
O(methanol) RDF is largely determined by the repulsive
core and geometric constraints. The system is a good
example of the case in which constituent molecules can
make only one hydrogen bond, only between solute and
solvent.

B. Dynamical properties: diﬀusion coeﬃcient and
reorientation relaxation time

Fig. 5 shows the density(pressure) dependence of the
normalized translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient D/D0 for
investigated solutes at various temperatures. Here D0 is
the translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the solute at the
ambient density for the solvent, which is ρ = 0.997047
g/cm3 for water in cases a), b), and ρ = 0.782 g/cm3
for acetonitrile in the case c), respectively. Fig. 5a)
shows that for suﬃciently low temperature the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient of methanol in water ﬁrst increases with den-
sity(pressure), and then begins to decrease. A relatively

9

ﬂat maximum is observed for the density slightly smaller
than that at the ambient condition. The increase in the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient with increasing density (or pressure)
can not be explained by the phenomenological theory
In that reason, such
such as the Stokes-Einstein law.
behavior is often stated “anomalous”. This is the ﬁrst to
realize such anomalous pressure dependence of the diﬀu-
sion constant of a solute in water by means of the sta-
tistical mechanics theory. As can be seen in the ﬁgure,
the anomalous density dependence is suppressed as tem-
perature increases and turns into normal behavior, i.e.,
the diﬀusion constant decreases monotonously with den-
sity. At the ambient condition, the diﬀusion constant
does not show any anomaly and is consistent with the
one obtained from the molecular dynamics simulation15,
which is plotted in the ﬁgure with the ﬁlled triangles.
Using the multi-parametric empirical equation of state
for water71 we converted original data15 from “diﬀusion
versus pressure” into “diﬀusion versus density”.

Similar features can be observed in the behavior of the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient of acetonitrile in water, Fig. 5b).
In this case, the increase of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient at
the lowest temperature is discernible, but very small as
can be barely observed with the guide of the cubic spline
curve. Behavior of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient at higher tem-
peratures, as in the case of methanol in water, does not
show any anomaly. The behavior is in harmony with the
results of the molecular dynamics simulation at the am-
bient condition15, which is plotted in the ﬁgure with the
ﬁlled squares. The experimental measurements of diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients for acetonitrile in water and acetonitrile-
D3 (CD3CN) in water, both at T = 303 K, reported
by Nakahara et al.3 testify the same tendency in their
density(pressure) dependence as those obtained from the
theory.

The diﬀusion coeﬃcient of methanol in acetonitrile are
plotted in Fig. 5c) as the function of density. The results
show monotonous decrease of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in
the entire range of densities and at all investigated tem-
peratures.

Fig. 6 shows the density(pressure) dependence of the
normalized reorientation relaxation time τ /τ0 for inves-
tigated systems at the same temperatures as for normal-
ized translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient D/D0. τ0 is the
reorientation relaxation time of the solute at the ambi-
ent density for the solvent. Fig. 6a) is a typical ex-

ﬁrst decreases with density(pressure) and then starts to
increase. The anomalous behavior becomes weaker as
temperature increases, and disappears at some point.
Apparently, the anomaly persists through higher tem-
perature than what is observed in the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient. The theoretical result is consistent again with that
from the molecular dynamics simulation at the ambient
condition15 in the sense that the both plots show a mini-
mum, although the positions of the minimum are slightly
diﬀerent from each other.

In the case of acetonitrile in water, Fig. 6b), the nor-
mal behavior of the reorientation relaxation time is ob-
served almost entirely except for the lowest temperature,
where a shallow minimum is discernible. The relaxation
time at the ambient temperature exhibits monotonous in-
crease. The behavior is in qualitative accord with the re-
sults from molecular dynamics simulation15 as indicated
with the ﬁlled squares in the ﬁgure.

Fig. 6c) exhibits monotonous increase of the reorien-
tation relaxation time of methanol in acetonitrile in the
entire range of densities and at all investigated tempera-
tures. It can be regarded as a typical example of normal

density(pressure) dependence of τ .

Fig. 7 has the purpose to demonstrate the anomalous
density(pressure) behavior of the reorientation relaxation
time in terms of the reorientation time-correlation func-
tion Cµ(t). It has been found that at T = 298.15 K the
curves for acetonitrile in water and methanol in acetoni-
trile move to the right as density increases, namely the re-
laxation time becomes longer when pressure is increased.
On the other hand, for methanol in water it shifts ﬁrst to
the left, and then for higher densities(pressures) it starts
to shift to the right. At the highest temperature Cµ(t)
for methanol in water moves only to the right, but the

displacement is very small. Considering that the time-
correlation function is related to the reorientation time
by an integral, the behaviors in the time-correlation func-
tions are consistent with those of the reorientation time
as has been described above.

In our previous studies concerning the neat water, we
have clariﬁed the cause of anomalous dependence of the
molecular dynamics on pressure, or the appearance of ex-
trema in the pressure dependence55,58. The anomalous
behavior is caused by an interplay of two competing ten-
dencies: the increasing mobility at the lower pressure and
the suppression of the motion in the higher pressure. The
suppression of the motion with increasing pressure is a
normal behavior caused by increased molecular collisions,
and the increase in the mobility is caused by the decrease
in the dielectric relaxation time. The appearance of the
extrema is attributed to the increasing dielectric motion
at the lower pressure. The origin of the decrease in the
dielectric relaxation time at the lower pressure is in the
reduction of the electrostatic friction on the dielectric
mode. Although the detailed analysis is presented in our
previous paper, let us summarize it below. The dielec-
tric mode describes the collective alignment of the polar
molecules. When the inhomogeneity of the number den-
sity is present as is described in Fig. 8a), the alignment of
the collective dipole moment induces the inhomogeneity
of the charge density, which leads to the electrostatic fric-
tion on the dielectric mode. Increasing density or pres-
sure will suppress the number density ﬂuctuation, which
in turn causes the reduction of the charge density ﬂuc-
tuation as is illustrated in Fig. 8b). The reduced charge
density ﬂuctuation in turn causes decrease in the elec-
trostatic friction on the dielectric mode, or increase in
the collective rotational motion. This is the rough pic-
ture with respect to the anomalous pressure dependence

12

Now we turn to the single-particle motion in water. In
the case of neat water, the translational and the rota-
tional diﬀusion of a molecule respond to pressure diﬀer-
ently, as is observed experimentally. The translational
motion of a molecule couples with the high wave vector
collective translational mode, which have inherent ten-
dency to become slower as pressure increases. On the
other hand, the coupling between the rotational motion
of a molecule and high wave vector collective transla-
tional modes is weak, and the friction on the rotation
of a molecule mainly comes from the coupling with the
low wave vector charge density mode, which is usually
referred to as the dielectric friction. The rotational mo-
tion of a molecule will induce a relaxation process of sur-
rounding molecules in order to make themselves aligned
to the electric ﬁeld produced by the new orientation of
the molecule in concern. The energy dissipation asso-
ciated with the relaxation process is an origin of the
friction on the rotational motion, or the dielectric fric-
tion. Slower the dielectric relaxation, greater the dielec-
tric friction. The anomalous pressure dependence ob-
served in the translational dynamics or the diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient turns out to be the secondary eﬀect induced by
the anomaly in the rotational motion. The anomaly in
the translational diﬀusion is therefore weaker than that
in the rotational relaxation.

The solute-solvent systems considered in the present
paper can be understood in a similar way as follows.
Whether the anomalous behavior actually shows up or
not also depends on the role of repulsive core in the ro-
tational motion of solute, which gives rise to the col-
lisional friction: a spherical molecule like water will be
free from the collisional friction, while a rod-like molecule
such as acetonitrile should have signiﬁcant collision with
solvent molecules upon rotation. The behavior exhib-
ited in Fig. 7 is consistent with the physical picture
drawn above. Figs. 7a) and 7b), which concern water as
solvent, show anomalous density dependence of the ro-
tational relaxation time, which disappears with increas-
ing temperature. The methanol-in-water system exhibits
more signiﬁcant anomaly compared to the acetonitrile-in-
water system. The anomalous behavior is attributed to
the strong electrostatic interaction, so called “hydrogen
bond”, among the solvent molecules and those between
solute and solvent. The former causes the decrease in the
dielectric relaxation time with pressure, and the latter
brings about the coupling between the dielectric mode of
the solvent and the rotation of the solute. The anomaly
is largely suppressed for the acetonitrile-in-water system
due to the enhanced signiﬁcance of the repulsive core in
the molecule. The methanol-in-acetonitrile system does
not show any indication of the anomalous density depen-
dence, although there is a hydrogen bond between solute
and solvent as is indicated in Fig. 4b). The reason is
because there is strong collisional friction on the collec-
tive reorientation of the solvent in this case, so that the
dielectric relaxation becomes slower with pressure. The
enhanced density or pressure just ampliﬁes the signiﬁ-
cance of the repulsive core upon rotation and thereby of
the collisional friction.

V. SUMMARY

In present paper we have calculated the density(pres-
sure) dependence at various temperatures for the trans-
lational diﬀusion coeﬃcients D and rank-1 reorientation
relaxation times τ for three solute-solvent systems at in-
ﬁnite dilution: acetonitrile and methanol in water, and
methanol in acetonitrile. Calculations have been perfor-
med using the site-site memory equation with the mo-
de-coupling approximation for memory kernels, and the
DRISM theory for static properties.

The theory was able to reproduce qualitatively all main
features of temperature and density dependences of D
and τ observed in real and computer experiments.
In
particular, anomalous behavior, i.e. the increase in mo-
bility with density, is observed for D and τ of methanol
in water at the ambient condition, while acetonitrile in
water and methanol in acetonitrile show the ordinary be-
havior, i.e.
the monotonous decrease in mobility with
increasing density. The variety exhibited by the diﬀer-
ent solute-solvent systems in the density dependence of
the mobility was interpreted in terms of the two compe-
ting origins of friction, which interplay with each other as
density increases: the collisional and dielectric frictions
which, respectively, increase and decrease with increasing
density. The cause of the dielectric friction is the inhomo-
geneity in the charge density of solvent, induced by the
number density ﬂuctuation due to the hydrogen bond.
The suppression of the number density ﬂuctuation and
the consequential decrease in the charge density ﬂuctua-
tion are the physical origins of the anomalous density de-
pendence of the molecular mobility in hydrogen-bonding
systems.

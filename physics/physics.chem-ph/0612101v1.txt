Investigating Diﬀusion Coeﬃcient Using Dynamic Light

Scattering Technique

Yong Sun∗

February 2, 2008

Abstract

In this work, the Z-average, eﬀective, apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcients and their
poly-dispersity indexes were investigated for dilute poly-disperse homogeneous spher-
ical particles in dispersion where the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye approximation is valid.
The results reveal that the values of the apparent and eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcients
at a scattering angle investigated are consistent and the diﬀerence between the ef-
fective and Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcients is a function of the mean particle size,
size distribution and scattering angle. For the small particles with narrow size dis-
tributions, the Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient can be got directly at any scattering
angle. For the small particles with wide size distributions, the Z-average diﬀusion
coeﬃcient should be measured at a small scattering angle. For large particles, in or-
der to obtain a good approximate value of Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient, the wider
the particle size distribution, the smaller the scattering angle that the DLS data are
measured. The poly-dispersity index of the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient at a scat-
tering angle investigated is consistent with that of the Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient
and without considering the inﬂuences of noises, the diﬀerence between the poly-
dispersity indexes of the Z-average and apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcients is determined
by the mean particle size, size distribution and scattering angle together.

INTRODUCTION

For colloidal dispersion systems, light scattering is a widely used technique to mea-
sure the characteristics of particles. One of the main applications of the dynamic light
scattering (DLS) technique is to obtain the Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient and its poly-
dispersity index for particles in liquid suspension. The DLS technique is to measure
the particle properties from the normalized time auto-correlation function of the scat-
tered light g(2) (τ ), here τ is the correlation delay time. The moments (or Cumulants)
method [1–4] has been used as a standard method to measure the Z-average diﬀusion
coeﬃcient and its poly-dispersity index from the DLS data. In general, when the DLS
data are analyzed, the mean diﬀusion coeﬃcient and its poly-dispersity index obtained

About the relationship between the Z-average and apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcients has
been investigated by a few authors [3]. Under appropriate conditions, they measured
the Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient by ﬁtting ln

tation coeﬃcient, the weight-average molar mass can be yielded. For large particles, the
authors suggest the Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient should be measured at a small enough
scattering angle. In order to obtain the accurate value of the weight-average molar mass,
it is important to measure the value of Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient accurately.

In this work, the Z-average, eﬀective, apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcients and their poly-
dispersity indexes were investigated for dilute poly-disperse homogeneous spherical par-
ticles in dispersion where the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD) approximation is valid. The
results reveal that the values of the apparent and eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcients at a
scattering angle investigated are consistent and the diﬀerence between the eﬀective and
Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcients is a function of the mean particle size, size distribution
and scattering angle. For the small particles with narrow size distributions, the Z-average
diﬀusion coeﬃcient can be got directly at any scattering angle. For the small particles
with wide size distributions, the Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient should be measured at a
small scattering angle. For large particles, in order to obtain a good approximate value
of Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient, the wider the particle size distribution, the smaller
the scattering angle that the DLS data are measured. The poly-dispersity index of the
eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient at a scattering angle investigated is consistent with that of
the Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient and without considering the inﬂuences of noises, the
diﬀerence between the poly-dispersity indexes of the Z-average and apparent diﬀusion
coeﬃcients is determined by the mean particle size, size distribution and scattering angle
together. For narrow particle size distributions, they are consistent. For wide particle
size distributions, the poly-dispersity index of apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient should be
measured at a τ range where τ max changes to a small value in order to obtain a good
approximate result of the poly-dispersity index of Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the previous work [5, 6], it was shown that the expected values of the DLS data
calculated based on the commercial and static particle size information are consistent
with the experimental data. In order to investigate the quantities of Dz, Def f , Dapp
and their ploy-dispersity indexes accurately, the values of g(2) (τ ) were produced as
described in the previous work [5] and thus Dz, Def f and their ploy-dispersity indexes
are calculated using Eqs.1, 2, 4, 5 and Dapp and its poly-dispersity index are obtained
using the ﬁrst two moments method, respectively.

When the ﬁrst two moments method were used to ﬁt the simulated data, the values
of Γapp and µ2app were chosen when they stabilize. The results for the simulated data
produced based on the mean static radius 50 nm and standard deviations 5, 25 nm at
scattering angles 30o and 90o were shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The results
show that all the ﬁt values obtained using the ﬁrst two moments method are consistent
with the simulated data very well, respectively.

The values of Dz and Def f at scattering angles 30o and 90o for diﬀerent standard
deviations 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 nm were calculated using Eqs. 1 and 4 and the results
of Dapp are obtained using the ﬁrst two moments method to ﬁt the diﬀerent simulated
data, respectively. All results of Dz, Def f and Dapp for standard deviations 3, 15 and

mean static radius 50 nm and standard deviations 3, 15 and 25 nm at scattering angles
30o and 90o, respectively.

Table 1 shows that the value of Def f is consistent with that of Dapp at any scattering
angle investigated and the diﬀerence between the values of Dz and Def f is inﬂuenced
by the scattering angle and particle size distribution. For narrow particle size distribu-
tions, the value of Dz is consistent with that of Def f obtained at any scattering angle
investigated. For wide particle size distributions, the diﬀerence between them is a func-
tion of the scattering angle. At a small scattering angle, the result of Def f is a good
approximate value of Dz.

Next, the simulated data produced based on the mean static radius 120 nm and
standard deviations 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 nm at scattering angles 30o and 90o were ex-
plored. The ﬁt results for the simulated data produced based on the standard deviations
12 nm, 60 nm at scattering angles 30o and 90o are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.
The ﬁgures show that all the ﬁt values obtained using the ﬁrst two moments method

In order to obtain the results of Def f at scattering angles 30o and 90o, and Dz, the
mean static radius 120 nm and standard deviations 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 nm were input

Finally, the situations for much larger particles were investigated. The simulated
data produced based on the mean static radius 260 nm and standard deviations 16, 26,
52, 78, 104, 130 nm at a scattering angle of 30o were explored. The ﬁt results for the
simulated data produced based on the standard deviations 26 nm, 130 nm at scattering
angles 30o were shown in Fig. 5a and 5b, respectively. Figure 5 shows that all the ﬁt
values obtained using the ﬁrst two moments method are consistent with the simulated

As above, using Eqs. 1 and 4, the values of Dz and Def f at a scattering angle of 30o
for diﬀerent standard deviations 16, 26, 52, 78, 104, 130 nm were obtained and using

In order to explore the inﬂuences of a wide particle size distribution on Def f for
small particles in details, the values of Def f were calculated using Eq. 1 for
30
nm and σ 15 nm at diﬀerent scattering angles. All results are shown in Fig. 6. Figure
6 reveals clearly that the DLS data should be measured at a small scattering angle in
order to obtain a good approximate value of Dz.

4 CONCLUSION

The values of the apparent and eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcients at a scattering angle inves-
tigated are consistent and the diﬀerence between the eﬀective and Z-average diﬀusion
coeﬃcients is a function of the mean particle size, size distribution and scattering angle.

7

For the small particles with narrow size distributions, the Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient
can be got directly at any scattering angle. For the small particles with wide size dis-
tributions, the Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient should be measured at a small scattering
angle. For large particles, in order to obtain a good approximate value of Z-average
diﬀusion coeﬃcient, the wider the particle size distribution, the smaller the scattering
angle that the DLS data are measured. The poly-dispersity index of the eﬀective diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient at a scattering angle investigated is consistent with that of the Z-average
diﬀusion coeﬃcient and without considering the inﬂuences of noises, the diﬀerence be-
tween the poly-dispersity indexes of the Z-average and apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcients is
determined by the mean particle size, size distribution and scattering angle together.
For narrow particle size distributions, they are consistent. For wide particle size distri-
butions, the poly-dispersity index of apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient should be measured
at a τ range where τ max changes to a small value in order to obtain a good approximate
result of the poly-dispersity index of Z-average diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

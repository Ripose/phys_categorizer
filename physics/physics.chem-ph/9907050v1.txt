We derive a rigorous optical potential for electron-molecule scattering including the eﬀects of
nuclear dynamics by extending the common many-body Green’s function approach to optical po-
tentials beyond the ﬁxed-nuclei limit for molecular targets. Our formalism treats the projectile
electron and the nuclear motion of the target molecule on the same footing whereby the dynamical
optical potential rigorously accounts for the complex many-body nature of the scattering target.
One central result of the present work is that the common ﬁxed-nuclei optical potential is a valid
adiabatic approximation to the dynamical optical potential even when projectile and nuclear motion
are (nonadiabatically) coupled as long as the scattering energy is well below the electronic excitation
thresholds of the target. For extremely low projectile velocities, however, when the cross sections
are most sensitive to the scattering potential, we expect the inﬂuences of the nuclear dynamics on
the optical potential to become relevant. For these cases, a systematic way to improve the adiabatic
approximation to the dynamical optical potential is presented that yields non-local operators with
respect to the nuclear coordinates.

I. INTRODUCTION

The concept of an optical potential as a physical entity that governs the scattering of a single particle by a composite
target is an intuitively appealing phenomenological concept that goes back to the early days of nuclear physics. In
principle, the scattering of a nonrelativistic, quantum-mechanical particle oﬀ an N -particle target is a many-body
problem and governed by the (N + 1)-particle Schr¨odinger equation. In the so-called optical model [1], the elastic
scattering problem is alternatively described by an eﬀective single-particle Schr¨odinger (or Lippmann-Schwinger)
equation. All eﬀects of the interaction of the projectile particle with the target are contained in the so-called optical
potential. In general, this optical potential has to be a very complicated object: It becomes a nonlocal operator
because exchange and rearrangement of target particles have to be considered. An energy dependence has to
account for possible excitations of the target and if inelastic scattering is energetically possible, the optical potential
is nonhermitian in order to describe the loss of scattering amplitude into the inelastic channels. One major technical
advantage of using optical potentials in numerical calculations is that the scattering problem can be separated from
the many-body problem and the latter can be treated using bound-state techniques.

The ability of many-body theory to derive exact, though not unique, optical potentials was a great success in the
1950’s [2–4]. The optical potential of Feshbach [1–3] follows from the most straightforward derivation by projection
from the (N + 1)-particle Schr¨odinger equation. An important alternative can be found in the self energy of the
single-particle Green’s function of traditional many-body theory [4–6].

In contrast to the Green’s function approach, the Feshbach optical potential is not easily amenable to perturbation
theoretical approximations. Achieving a balanced and consistent treatment of ground- and excited-state correlation
is thus diﬃcult to achieve. Moreover, Mahaux and Sartor [7] have found in applications to nuclear matter that the
nonlocality in the Feshbach optical potential is more complicated than in the Green’s function optical potential. The
numerical applications of Feshbach’s theory on electron-molecule scattering reported so far, have been realised by
projection of conﬁguration interaction (CI) matrices [8,9] but have rarely gone beyond the uncorrelated Hartree-Fock
level for the description of the target’s ground state. The inclusion of correlated, i. e., multi-conﬁgurational target
wavefunctions in this context presents a delicate problem [10,11].

On the other hand, the Green’s function optical potential [4] deﬁned by the Dyson equation [12] has turned out to
be well-behaved and well-suited for numerical calculations. The Green’s function approach to the optical potential has
the advantage, that the self energy of the single-particle Green’s function is easily accessible through the Feynman-
Dyson perturbation expansion [12]. Thus a balanced treatment of ground-state and excited-state correlation is
automatically achieved. Various approximation schemes for the self energies of molecules have been developed [13–15]
and applications to electron-molecule scattering have been reported in Refs. [16–20].

1

All the previous calculations employing optical potentials have been done in the ﬁxed-nuclei limit where the eﬀects
of nuclear motion are neglected altogether. A great variety of methods and numerical procedures can be used for
solving the single-particle scattering equations in the ﬁxed-nuclei limit like, e. g., the R-matrix [21–23], the Schwinger-
variational [24], the complex-Kohn [25,26] and the close-coupling [27,28] approaches. An often-used approximate
treatment of the nuclear motion derives from the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In this so-called adiabatic-nuclei
approximation [29,30,27], ﬁxed-nuclei S-matrix elements for each conﬁguration R of the atomic nuclei are averaged,
weighted by the nuclear wavefunctions of the isolated target molecule. This approximation, however, breaks down
for low projectile energies and, in particular, for resonant vibrational excitation (see e. g. [31]). Finally, in situations
where the electronic projectiles move with velocities that are comparable to the typical velocities of nuclear motion,
it becomes indispensable to treat the coupled motion correctly.

The most straightforward way of accounting for the full, nonadiabatic coupling of the nuclear motion to the
motion of the projectile electron is realised in the close-coupling formalism [27,28]. In this formalism, the scattering
wavefunction of the full problem (i. e. the degrees of freedom of N + 1 electrons and the nuclear degrees of freedom
appear as variables) is expanded in a ﬁnite set of basis functions that are chosen according to appropriate exact
or approximate constants of motion. Usually it is not feasible to include excited electronic states of the target in
the close-coupling expansion. These states, however, are necessary to describe polarisation eﬀects correctly. In the
literature, so far model potentials void of rigorous justiﬁcation have been used to account for this defect [27,32–34].
The close-coupling formalism further has the problem that the numerical calculations are diﬃcult to converge for very
low projectile energies [35].

An alternative to the one-step close-coupling expansion for treating the nuclear dynamics in electron-molecule
scattering is a two-step procedure employing the so-called projection-operator (PO) formalism [36–38]. Based on
the assumption of a resonance in ﬁxed-nuclei electron scattering, the PO approach can be used to treat the nuclear
dynamics going beyond the adiabatic-nuclei picture. In the PO formalism the electronic scattering problem is separated
from the nuclear dynamics by Feshbach projection such that only some resonance parameters, which can be taken
from ﬁxed-nuclei scattering calculations, determine the equations for the nuclear dynamics that have to be solved.
The coupling to the continuum of electronic scattering wavefunctions enters the nuclear dynamics via a complex,
nonlocal potential. Diﬀerent levels of approximation for the nonadiabatic coupling of electronic and nuclear motion
are reached by local and nonlocal models for the complex potential [36]. The PO method has been very successful
in explaining many features of resonant electron-molecule scattering and it gives a very intuitive picture for the
mechanism of many physical processes like, e. g., resonant vibrational excitation [37]. On the other hand it is per se
not an exact approach because only resonant contributions to the cross sections can be treated. There are always
non-resonant contributions (also called background contributions) that cannot be evaluated in the PO formalism but
may actually dominate the spectra in oﬀ-resonance scattering. Sometimes no dominating resonance is present at
all, and sometimes numerous resonances contribute which are diﬃcult to identify individually. For these cases the
separation of nuclear and electronic motion ultimately fails. Also the nonlocality of the complex potential usually
becomes very complicated and diﬃcult to model for very slow scattering electrons: Details of the electron-molecule
interaction and the dynamical coupling of electronic, vibrational, and rotational degrees of freedom become important
when the time scales of projectile and nuclear motion in the target are comparable. As an example we may mention
the scattering by a polar molecule with a supercritical or near-to-critical dipole moment. As it is well-known, a
supercritical, nonrotating dipole (D > 1.625 Debye) can bind an excess electron but this bound state is weakened or
even disappears if the dipole is allowed to rotate [39]. It is, however, very diﬃcult to include the correct coupling
of rotational degrees of freedom in the nonlocal complex potential model [40] and thus a full dynamical calculation
including all relevant degrees of freedom may become necessary in order to describe the physics of very-low energy
scattering by polar molecules correctly.

To our knowledge, no one has so far given a rigorous derivation of an optical potential for the scattering electron
that takes full account of the nuclear motion. To close this gap is the main objective of the present communication. In
this paper we will present an optical potential that is based on the usual Green’s function optical potential but allows
to treat projectile and nuclear motion on the same footing. This so-called dynamical optical potential is given by
the self energy of the dynamical Green’s function, an extension of the usual single-particle Green’s function including
the nuclear kinetic-energy operator. The dynamical optical potential is an optical potential for electron-molecule
scattering that is elastic with respect to electronic excitations of the target but inelastic with respect to the vibrations
or rotations of the target. The only assumption that is used throughout this paper is that the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation is valid for the target’s ground state. Otherwise the dynamical optical potential is exact. It takes
full account of the many-body eﬀects of electron scattering including exchange and polarisation as well as the full
nonadiabatic coupling of the projectile motion to the nuclear motion of the target. The expressions we derive for the
exact optical potential may provide guidance for the choice of model potentials on the one hand, and on the other
hand are amenable to ab-initio approximations and can be calculated with standard quantum-chemical methods.

This paper is organised as follows: In the next chapter we will start with reviewing the deﬁnition of the traditional

2

single-particle Green’s function of many-body theory. Applied only to the electronic degrees of freedom of a molecule
at ﬁxed nuclear conﬁguration we also call this propagator the electronic Green’s function. In the subsequent Sec. II B
we then deﬁne the dynamical Green’s function, which allows for the treatment of the full molecular dynamics including
the nuclear degrees of freedom as dynamical variables. We also deﬁne the closely related (nuclear) inelastic Green’s
function that shows the close relation to the recently developed theory of electronically inelastic Green’s functions.
Sec. II is closed by showing how the electronic propagator can be obtained in a suitable limit from the dynamical
Green’s function. In the third chapter an algebraic derivation of Dyson’s equation for the electronic Green’s function
is reviewed before the dynamic Green’s function is shown to fulﬁl a Dyson equation and the dynamical self energy
is deﬁned. Chapter IV treats the relation to electron-molecule scattering. The dynamical self energy is shown to be
closely related to the optical potential for the coupled motion of the projectile electron and the atomic nuclei of the
target molecule in electronically elastic scattering. Expressions for the scattering S and T matrices are shown for
inelastic processes with respect to the nuclear coordinates including vibrational or rotational excitation, associative
detachment, and dissociative attachment. In Sec. IV B an eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation using the dynamical optical
potential is discussed. A direct derivation for the eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation based on projection operators is
given in Sec. IV C, which yields additional insight into the relation of our Green’s function approach to Feshbach’s
theory. The well-known static-exchange and the ﬁxed-nuclei scattering equations are identiﬁed as approximations to
our exact equations in Secs. IV D 1 and IV D 2. The rest of Sec. IV D is devoted to the discussion of diﬀerent possible
approximations to the dynamical optical potential, in particular concerning the treatment of the nuclear dynamics
in virtual electronic excitations of the target. We also discuss how to compute the dynamical optical potential using
standard ab initio quantum chemistry methods.

II. THE DYNAMICAL SINGLE-PARTICLE GREEN’S FUNCTION

Traditional many-body theory [12] deals with systems of indistinguishable particles. Applications to molecules
usually treat only the electronic degrees of freedom in the many-body formalism and freeze the nuclear conﬁguration.
After brieﬂy reviewing the deﬁnition of this purely electronic single-particle Green’s function we will deﬁne the
dynamical Green’s function, which allows us to treat the nuclear degrees of freedom as dynamical variables.

The usual single-particle Green’s function G(rt, r′t′) of non-relativistic many-body theory is deﬁned by [12]

|ΨN

†

0 i denotes the exact (correlated) ground state of the N -particle system,
Here, θ(t) is Heavyside’s step function,
(r, t) is the Heisenberg ﬁeld operator, which creates a particle at position r and time t. Although we consider
and ψ
fermionic particles, electrons in particular, we suppress the notation of spin indices for simplicity (r may be considered
as spin-space variable). In applications of many-body theory to molecular physics one usually assumes an adiabatic
decoupling of electronic and nuclear motion and thus only treats the electronic degrees of freedom explicitly. G(rt, r′t′)
is then the Green’s function in a system of electrons moving in the static potential of the nuclei, ﬁxed at the coordinates
R. In the following, we will call G(rt, r′t′) the (purely) electronic Green’s function in contrast to the later deﬁned
dynamical Green’s function, which will allow to treat non-adiabatic coupling of electronic and nuclear motion.

The Green’s function decomposes into two parts, the so-called particle propagator G+ and hole propagator G−:

G(rt, r′t′) = G+(rt, r′t′) + G−(rt, r′t′).

Noting that the (purely electronic) Heisenberg operator ψ

(r, t) evolves in time with the electronic Hamiltonian He

we can rewrite the particle and the hole propagator in the following way:

Here, we made use of the fact that the electronic ground state |ΨN
He with the energy of the electronic ground state V0(R):

0 i is an eigenstate of the electronic Hamiltonian

He |ΨN

0 i = V0(R) |ΨN

0 i.

We explicitly indicate here the dependence of V0 on the nuclear coordinates R for later use. Of course, He and |ΨN
0 i
depend parametrically on R as well.

For convenience, we will later discuss the Green’s functions mainly in the frequency instead of the time domain and
using an orbital instead of a position space representation. The corresponding expression for the electronic Green’s
function Gpq(ω), which is equivalent to the deﬁnition (1), reads

Gpq(ω) = hΨN

)F (t − t′).
Here, the Fourier transformation into the frequency domain is deﬁned by F (ω) =
The positive inﬁnitesimal η remains from a convergence factor that has to be introduced to assure the convergence
of the Fourier transformation. The sign of the term iη determines the time ordering by theta functions in Eqs. (4)
and (5) [12]. The transformation into the orbital representation is deﬁned by the transformation of the creation and
destruction operators of second quantisation. For convenience we assume that {ϕp(r)}p is a discrete but complete set
of square-integrable and normalised basis functions for the single-particle Hilbert space. The creation operator for an
electron in the orbital ϕp(r) is deﬁned by

−∞ d(t − t′) eiω(t−t′

R

a†
p =

dr ϕp(r)ψ†(r).

Z

Like usual, the orthonormality of the orbitals implies the canonical anti-commutation relations {a†

p , aq} = δpq, etc.

The orbital set has been chosen discrete just for conceptual clearness and simple notation. The generalisation to
continuous sets does not pose principal problems. Convenient realisations of orbitals may be found, e. g., in the
Hartree-Fock orbitals of the target (together with a convenient discretisation of the continuum) or in the momentum
space representation (discretised by placing the system in a ﬁnite box and employing periodic boundary conditions).

If we now want to couple the electronic motion dynamically to the nuclear motion we have to replace the electronic

Hamiltonian He by the full molecular Hamiltonian

B. The dynamical Green’s function

H = Tn + He.

It is given by the sum of the nuclear kinetic energy operator Tn and the electronic Hamiltonian He. By convention,
He contains the internuclear repulsion in addition to the electronic kinetic energy as well as the electron-nucleus
Coulomb attraction and the electron-electron repulsion. The nuclear kinetic energy operator Tn generally includes
all vibrational, rotational and translational degrees of freedom for the target molecule. For convenience we assume
that the translational motion has been separated oﬀ.
In this case rotation, vibration, and dissociation are the
remaining degrees of freedom for the nuclear motion. In any case, Tn is a diﬀerential operator that acts on the nuclear
coordinate R. Thus Tn does not commute with He or V0(R). However, we want to assume in the following that
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is valid for the electronic ground state of the molecular target, which implies
that the commutator of Tn with the electronic ground state [Tn , |ΨN
0 i] is negligible. Physically, this means that the
electronic conﬁguration in |ΨN

0 i depends only weakly on the nuclear coordinates.

Let us introduce the nuclear Hamiltonian

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

and let φk(R) be an eigenfunction with eigenvalue E0k:

Hn = Tn + V0(R)

Hnφk(R) = E0kφk(R).

4

In the following we will also use the abstract Dirac notation |φki from time to time for the nuclear eigenstates. The
wavefunction φk(R) then emerges as the coordinate representation of the state |φki by φk(R) = hR|φki.

Under the assumption that Tn commutes with |ΨN

0 i, it is easily seen that the product wavefunction |ΨN

0 iφk(R)

becomes a molecular eigenstate with energy E0k:

H |ΨN

0 iφk(R) = E0k |ΨN

0 iφk(R).

This Born-Oppenheimer picture is usually an adequate description for closed-shell molecules in the electronic ground
state. The negligibility of the commutator [Tn , |ΨN
0 i] is the only fundamental assumption of the theory we will
develop in the following. At the end of Sec. IV C we will return to discuss the validity of this approximation and show
how the theory can be generalised. At this point we want to stress that we only assume the Born-Oppenheimer picture
to be valid for the nuclear dynamics in the electronic ground state of the molecule. We neither assume adiabaticity
for the scattering electron nor for the electronically excited target states!

We now deﬁne the dynamical Green’s function G(rt, r′t′) as the sum of the two components for particle and

hole propagation:

The particle part G+ is deﬁned by

G(rt, r′t′) = G+(rt, r′t′) + G−(rt, r′t′).

iG+(rt, r′t′) = hΨN

0 | ψ(r)e−i(H−E00)(t−t′

)ψ†(r′) |ΨN

0 i θ(t − t′).

This propagator resembles the standard particle propagator (4) where the electronic Hamiltonian He appears instead
of the total Hamiltonian H and the electronic ground state energy V0(R) replaces the molecular ground state energy
E00. Note that H now includes the nuclear kinetic energy Tn, which is a diﬀerential operator on the nuclear coordinates
R. Thus, also G is an operator on R. As will be shown explicitly in Sec. IV D 4, the dynamical Green’s function G
may also be understood as a nonlocal integral operator in the nuclear coordinates:

hR| G(rt, r′t′) |φi =

dR′G(rRt, r′R′t′) φ(R′).

Z

For the sake of simple notation, however, we will not indicate the R-dependence of G explicitly.

The hole part G− is deﬁned with a modiﬁed Hamiltonian because this will be helpful later for the formulation of

the Dyson equation:

iG−(rt, r′t′) = hΨN

0 | ψ†(r′)ei[H−E00−2(Hn−E00)](t−t′

)ψ(r) |ΨN

0 i θ(t′ − t).

As long as we describe scattering or attachment processes, only G+ has physical signiﬁcance and the propagation
with the “wrong” Hamiltonian H − E00 − 2(Hn − E00) does not enter the physics. If, however, we want to study
ionisation where the hole part carries physical signiﬁcance, we have to modify the deﬁnition of the dynamical Green’s
function G and allow G− to propagate with the correct Hamiltonian H − E00. In this case we may modify G+ in order
to obtain a well-behaved Dyson equation. In the following we will keep to the choice (14) and (16) because we are
mainly interested in the scattering problem in this communication.

Note that the particle part G+ can still be expressed by an expectation value of a product of Heisenberg ﬁeld

operators:

iG+(rt, r′t′) = e−i(Hn−E00)thΨN

0 | ψ(rt)ψ†(rt′) |ΨN

0 iei(Hn−E00)t′

θ(t − t′).

(17)

In contrast to the deﬁnition of the purely electronic single-particle Green’s function (1), the ﬁeld operators ψ(rt) and
ψ†(rt′) now evolve in time with the full molecular Hamiltonian H = Tn + He and thus feel the eﬀect of nuclear motion
in the target. The hole part G− cannot be expressed in such a simple way as G+.

We conclude this subsection with the expression the dynamical Green’s function in the frequency domain and orbital

representation:

(12)

(13)

(14)

This expression is equivalent to the deﬁnition of the dynamical Green’s function in the time domain, (13) to (16).

C. The inelastic Green’s function

The dynamical Green’s function G presents, like the purely electronic propagator G, a matrix (or kernel of an
integral operator) in time and in the coordinates of a single electron. Moreover, G is an operator in the nuclear
coordinates R. For later use and for comparison with the (electronically) inelastic theory of reference [41], we deﬁne
the inelastic Green’s function G[m,n] as the matrix element of G with respect to the nuclear wavefunctions φn(R):

G[m,n](rt, r′t′) = hφm| G(rt, r′t′) |φni.

(19)

This inelastic Green’s function relates directly to the S-matrix of rotationally or vibrationally inelastic scattering like
we will see later.

The relation to the inelastic Green’s function studied by Cederbaum [41] becomes apparent when we evaluate the
0 iφk(R) of Eq. (12),
particle part of G[m,n]. We introduce the symbolic notation |0kii for the molecular state |ΨN
which describes a (ro-)vibrational excitation with quantum number k in the electronic ground state. From Eqs. (11)
and (17) it follows that we can write the particle part of the inelastic Green’s function as

iG[m,n]+(rt, r′t′) = hh0m| ψ(rt)ψ†(rt′) |0niie−i[(E0m−E00)t−(E0n−E00)t′

]θ(t − t′),

(20)

where the double bracket notation hh·|·ii indicates integration over both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom.
Expression (20) is completely analogous to the deﬁnition of Ref. [41]. While in this Reference inelastic scattering
between diﬀerent electronic excitations of the target is considered and the nuclear degrees of freedom are neglected,
the present study focuses on inelastic processes with respect to the vibrations and rotations in the same adiabatic
electronic conﬁguration. In contrast to Ref. [41] where the projectile particle, for instance a positron, is distinguishable
from the target electrons, our projectile is an electron and we fully account for the indistinguishable nature of the
projectile and target electrons in the present approach. For this reason we need the hole part G−, which, admittedly,
takes on a less intuitive form than the particle part G+ but will prove very useful later for the formulation of the
Dyson equation.

We now want to show that the dynamical Green’s function G boils down to the usual electronic Green’s function G
when the nuclear dynamics becomes unimportant. Formally the transition from G to G is achieved by assuming that
the Hamiltonian of nuclear motion Hn = Tn + V0(R) can be replaced by its lowest eigenvalue E00. When we express
the nuclear kinetic energy Tn in the molecular Hamiltonian H = Tn + He by Hn − V0(R) and replace Hn by E00, the
parts of the dynamical Green’s function G+ and G− in Eqs. (14) and (16) reduce to the conventional expressions (4)
and (5) for the electronic Green’s function G+ and G−. Also in the inelastic formalism the transition to the purely
electronic Green’s function can be achieved. The elastic channel component G[0,0] can be expressed through the purely
electronic Green’s function under the assumption that the nuclear kinetic energy Tn commutes with the electronic
Hamiltonian He:

G[0,0](rt, r′t′)

[Tn , He]→0

0(R) G(rt, r′t′) φ0(R).

For the inelastic components we ﬁnd an expression that reminds us of the adiabatic-nuclei approximation:

The phase factors account for the diﬀerent reference energies of the channel states.

III. DYSON EQUATION AND DYNAMICAL SELF ENERGY

In this section we will derive Dyson’s equation for the dynamical Green’s function and we will show that the
dynamical self energy can easily be expressed as a generalisation of the purely electronic self energy. Before turning
to the dynamical Green’s function, however, we will brieﬂy review the algebraic derivation of Dyson’s equation for the
traditional single-particle Green’s function. The Dyson equation for the dynamical Green’s function will then follow
easily as a generalisation of this procedure.

A. The Dyson equation for the electronic Green’s function

The following derivation of the Dyson equation is close in spirit to Refs. [42] and [43]. In the present form it has
already been given in Ref. [44]. For convenience we use the representation of the Green’s functions in the frequency
domain and orbital representation in this Chapter as deﬁned by Eqs. (7) and (18).

The deﬁnition (7) of the electronic Green’s function may be written in a more compact form, combining the particle

and the hole propagator. To this end we introduce the following composite vectors

and the matrix

|Ypi =

(cid:19)

Gpq(ω) = hYp|

|Yqi.

1
ω − ˘H

We can rewrite Eq. (7) by formally expressing the single-particle Green’s function as a matrix element of the

resolvent of ˘H with respect to the states |Ypi:

Here, we omitted the iη terms to avoid clumsy notation. The time-ordering controlled by these terms is usually not
important but may become relevant in time-dependent formulations of scattering theory (see Sec. IV A).

The scalar product of the composite vectors |Ypi now includes the matrix-vector product where bras always move to
the left and kets move to the right. With respect to this canonical scalar product, the vectors |Ypi fulﬁl the following
orthonormality relation:

hYp|Yqi = hΨN

0 | apa†

q |ΨN

0 i + hΨN

0 | a†

qap |ΨN

0 i = δpq.

When the N -electron wavefunction |ΨN

0 i is approximated by a Slater determinant, the vector |Ypi contains either
a single-hole state, if p refers to an unoccupied orbital, or a single-particle state, if not. In the more general case of
a correlated wavefunction |ΨN
0 i, the vectors |Ypi mix N − 1 and N + 1-electron states. Note that in either case and
for arbitrary single-particle indices p, the vectors |Ypi may be seen as orthogonal states that span a linear space with
the same dimension as (or isomorphous to) the single-particle Hilbert space. We will call the space spanned by the
vectors {|Ypi}p the primary space. Since the primary states |Ypi and their linear combinations are not, in general,
exact eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian He, they couple to the higher excitations like two-particle–one-hole
excitations, one-particle–two-hole excitations, etc. The space of higher excitations will be called the secondary space
[45]. The concept of single-hole, two-particle–one-hole excitations, etc. is, of course, only adequate when the target
state |ΨN
0 i will be represented by a correlated wavefunction
and thus the primary and the secondary space cannot be easily expressed by single-conﬁguration basis states. For
an explicit construction of a basis for the secondary space that allows for convenient approximations to the Green’s
function or the self energy in the framework of the so-called intermediate state representations see Refs. [42,46]. In
the following we assume that we have a basis of the composite space { |QJi}J that consists of the primary states
{|Ypi}p augmented by any suitable basis for the secondary space. The particular choice of the basis for the secondary
space does not matter.

0 i is dominated by a single conﬁguration. In general, |ΨN

We may now proceed to derive the Dyson equation and deﬁne the self energy setting out from Eq. (25). The basis

{ |QJi}J of the composite space deﬁnes a basis set representation ˘H of the matrix Hamiltonian ˘H:

By virtue of the subdivision of the basis set into two parts, the matrix ˘H is structured into blocks:

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

The block index a refers to primary states {|Ypi}p and b to the rest of the basis { |QJi}J . The upper left block of
this matrix is readily evaluated using Eqs. (23) and (24):

[ ˘H]IJ = hQI | ˘H |QJ i.

It is easily seen, now, that the electronic Green’s function of Eq. (25) can be understood as the upper left block of

an inverse matrix:

The proof follows by using the completeness of the basis { |QJ i}J and the orthonormality of the primary states
{|Ypi}p. By simple matrix partitioning, the inverse matrix of the Green’s function G(ω), can be expressed by

G(ω) =

In order to deﬁne the self energy and to make contact to the usual form of Dyson’s equation, we introduce a
perturbation theoretic separation of the electronic Hamiltonian He into a zeroth order, an interaction part, and the
internuclear repulsion term UN(R), which does not act as an operator on the electronic coordinates:

The zeroth order part He,0 is a one-particle operator of the form

He = He,0 + He,1 + UN(R).

He,0 =

εij a†

i aj.

ij
X

A convenient choice may be realized by the electronic kinetic energy or the Hartree-Fock operator. We do not demand
the operator He,0 to be diagonal in the given orbital basis but a diagonalising choice of the single-particle basis is
always possible. E. g. if He,0 is chosen to represent the kinetic energy, the matrix ε with the matrix elements
= εij
becomes diagonal in the momentum representation. In atomic units, the diagonal element is then simply given by
εp = p2/2. In practical applications, He,0 is often chosen the Hartree-Fock operator.

On the assumption that the electronic ground-state wavefunction |ΨN

0 i and energy V0(R) both possess well-behaved
perturbation expansions, the zeroth order of the matrix ˘H aa can be easily evaluated from Eq. (28) to give the matrix
of the zeroth-order orbital energies:

B. The Dyson equation for the dynamical Green’s function

We will show in the following that a Dyson equation for the dynamical Green’s function G can be derived in an
analogous manner, using the concepts of the previous section. We will discuss in particular the dependence on the
nuclear coordinates, which becomes important because of the introduction of the nuclear kinetic energy operator.

Just like the electronic Green’s function, the dynamical Green’s function G of Eq. (18) can be written in a compact
form combining the ionisation and attachment parts. Using the composite states |Ypi of (23) and the electronic matrix
Hamiltonian ˘H of (24), we can rewrite the expression (18) for the dynamical Green’s function to give

Gpq(ω) = hYp|

1
ω − ˘H − Hn + E00

|Yqi.

(38)

We again dropped the iη terms here for brevity. Also the 2 × 2 unit matrix that allows ω, Hn, and E00 to be applied
to the two-component vector |Ypi is omitted. The particularly simple and compact form of this expression can be
seen as a preliminary justiﬁcation for the particular choice of G− in the deﬁnition (16). Dyson’s equation can now
easily be derived in an analogous way to the last section.

Comparing with the expression (25) for the electronic Green’s function, we see that only the term −Hn + E00 is
additionally present in the dynamical Green’s function of Eq. (38). The molecular ground state energy E00 is just
a constant and deﬁnes the zero point of the ω scale. The “nuclear” Hamiltonian Hn = Tn + V0(R) introduces the
nuclear kinetic energy operator Tn, which is a diﬀerential operator on the nuclear coordinates R. It is therefore useful
to consider the R-dependence of the quantities used in the derivation of the Dyson equation.

The matrix operator ˘H contains the electronic Hamiltonian He and the ground state energy V0(R). Both quantities
depend on the nuclear coordinates R and thus care has to be taken because ˘H and Hn do not commute. For the
moment we want to assume that the electronic orbital basis that deﬁnes the electronic creation operators a†
p is
independent of the nuclear coordinates R. This is the case, e. g. for the momentum or position space representation.
This restriction is just convenient for the derivation of the Dyson equation but not essential and we will see later
(Sec. IV C) that it can be lifted as long as the chosen single-particle basis for the electrons is complete. The R
dependence of the composite states |Ypi of Eq. (23) now derives entirely from the electronic ground state |ΨN
0 i. Like
we already mentioned in Sec. II B, we assume that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is valid for the electronic
ground state and thus the nuclear kinetic energy Tn commutes with |ΨN
0 i. Consequently we may assume that the
nuclear Hamiltonian Hn commutes with the composite states |Ypi. We also assume that the basis states |QJ i of the
secondary space are conveniently chosen, such that the commutator with Tn or Hn can be neglected. An appropriate
choice is always possible [47]. The nuclear Hamiltonian Hn can consequently be pulled out of any matrix element
involving the basis states of the composite electronic space and thus the matrix representation of Hn in this basis is
proportional to the unit matrix:

In analogy to Eq. (29) we can understand the dynamical Green’s function G as the upper left block of an inverse
matrix:

hQI | Hn |QJ i = δIJ Hn.

G(ω) =

 

(ω − Hn + E00)1 − ˘H !aa

.

1

G(0)(ω) =

1
(ω − Hn + E00)1 − ε

,

The elements of this matrix are now operators acting on the nuclear coordinates. Matrix partitioning can be applied
and is completely analogous to the case of the electronic Green’s function.

Owing to the partitioning (31) of the electronic Hamiltonian He into a zeroth order and interaction part, we ﬁnd

for the zeroth order dynamical Green’s function

where ε is again the matrix of zeroth-order single-electron energies. In the simple case where the electronic kinetic
energy is chosen as the zeroth-order electronic Hamiltonian He,0, the matrix ε is diagonal in the momentum repre-
sentation and independent of the nuclear coordinates R as mentioned in the Sec. III A. The zeroth order dynamical
Green’s function G(0) now is also diagonal and describes the simultaneous motion of a free electron and the vibrations
(or rotations) of the isolated target molecule.

In the more general case where the matrix ε depends on R (if, e. g. He,0 is chosen the R-dependent Hartree-Fock
operator), the zeroth-order propagator G(0) may be understood to describe the coupled motion of a vibrating (or

9

(39)

(40)

(41)

rotating) molecule in the electronic ground state and a single electron that moves under the inﬂuence of R-dependent
mean ﬁelds. Since the zeroth-order electronic Hamiltonian He,0 is a one-particle operator, the motion of the scattering
electron is decoupled from the target electrons. The eﬀective Hamiltonian for the coupled projectile and nuclear motion
is thus independent of the scattering energy and simply given by Hn + He,0 − E00. The zeroth-order Green’s function
G(0) is the resolvent of this eﬀective Hamiltonian.
For the full dynamical Green’s function we ﬁnd

where the dynamical self energy A is deﬁned by

G(ω) =

In comparison to the zeroth order case, the dynamical self energy A(ω) now accounts for the many-body nature of the
molecular target. We will demonstrate in the next section that A(ω) indeed is an optical potential for (electronically
elastic) electron-molecule scattering. It is remarkable that the nuclear Hamiltonian Hn appears in the self energy
A(ω) together with the ω dependence and thus introduces derivatives with respect to the nuclear coordinates. Like
we shall see in detail later, the dynamical self energy thus becomes a non-local operator not only in the electronic but
also in the nuclear coordinates. In Sec. IV D we will discuss the meaning of the nuclear Hamiltonian appearing in the
dynamical self energy and possible approximations.

In a very formal manner, A(ω) can be expressed by the usual electronic self energy Σ(ω):

A(ω) = Σ(ω − Hn + E00).

(44)

Before we turn to the discussion of the scattering S-matrix and the optical potential in the next section, we would
like to present the Dyson equation in terms of the inelastic Green’s function G[m,n] of Eq. (19). Carrying on the
analogy to the inelastic formalism of Ref. [41] will help us in the next section to identify the dynamical self energy
with the optical potential. The inelastic formalism also yields a slightly diﬀerent view of the Dyson equation as
the introduction of nuclear eigenfunctions φn(R) formally leads to an equal treatment of the electronic and nuclear
degrees of freedom, at the cost of having to introduce another sort of matrix indices.

Instead of using the purely electronic basis { |QJ i}J , we introduce the product basis { |QJ i ⊗ |φni}J,n, where |φni
is the abstract notation for the nuclear wavefunction φn(R). The expression (19) for the inelastic Green’s function in
the frequency domain and orbital representation then reads

G[m,n](ω) = hφm| hYp|

1
ω − ˘H − Hn + E00

|Yqi |φni.

The bracket of the nuclear states hφm| . . . |φni implies integration over the nuclear coordinates. The derivation of the
Dyson equation can now be redone using the matrix representation deﬁned by the product basis. In the following we
denote matrices in the labels of the nuclear states n, m by boldface letters and matrices in the electronic state labels
I, J, p, q with double underbars. The zeroth order inelastic Green’s function becomes

The matrix of the nuclear Hamiltonian Hn is diagonal due to the particular choice of the nuclear wavefunction basis:

G(0)(ω) =

1
(ω + E00)1 − H n1 − ε .

[H n][m,n] = δmnE0n.

G(ω) =

1
(ω + E00)1 − H n1 − ε − A(ω)

,

The full inelastic Green’s function reads

IV. APPLICATION TO ELECTRON-MOLECULE SCATTERING

In this chapter we discuss the relation of the dynamical Green’s function to the process of electron-molecule
scattering. We introduce the S- and T -matrices of electronically elastic but vibrationally or rotationally inelastic
scattering and show how they can be calculated using the dynamical Green’s function formalism developed in the last
sections. We present an eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation and discuss the role of the dynamical self energy as an optical
potential for the scattering process. An direct derivation of the eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation is given and possible
approximations to the exact equations are discussed.

A. The S- and T -matrices of inelastic scattering

The relation of the dynamical Green’s function to the S- and T -matrices of scattering theory is very similar to
elastic electronic scattering oﬀ atoms or rigid molecules [5,6] and completely analogous to the electronically inelastic
case [41]. We therefore sketch the derivation only very brieﬂy.

The S-matrix for the processes we consider reads

where the stationary scattering states |Ψm±
by

p

ii with incoming (−) or outgoing (+) boundary conditions are deﬁned

S(p′m ← pn) = hhΨm−

p′

|Ψn+

p ii,

|Ψn±

p ii = lim
t→∓∞

e−i(εp+E0n−H)ta†

p |ΨN

0 i |φni,

and the double bracket notation again implies integration over electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. The
asymptotic states thus feature a free electron with momentum p and energy εp = p2/2 (in atomic units) and an
N -electron molecular state |ΨN
0 i |φni with the nth excited vibration or rotation in the electronic ground state with
energy E0n. For deﬁniteness we choose the electronic kinetic energy as the zeroth-order electronic Hamiltonian He,0
in this section, describing the motion of free electrons. Note that the scalar product of Eq. (52) implies integration
over all coordinates of the N + 1 electrons in addition to the integration over the nuclear coordinates R.

The S-matrix can be expressed by the particle part of the inelastic Green’s function of Eq. (19) in the momentum

representation as follows from the deﬁnition (14) and Eqs. (52) and (53):

S(p′m ← pn) = lim
t→+∞
t′→−∞

ei(εp′ +E0m−E00)t G[m,n]+

p′p

(t, t′) e−i(εp+E0n−E00)t′

.

(54)

The particle part G[m,n]+ may be replaced here by the full Green’s function G[m,n] for two reasons:

• The hole part G[m,n]− does not contribute because the S-matrix only contains information about the asymptotic
region of scattering where G[m,n]− vanishes because ap |ΨN
0 i vanishes. For the eﬀective single-particle scattering
equations we are going to derive in the following, this means that ensuring the correct outgoing boundary
condition avoids contamination of the wavefunction by unphysical contributions.

• The hole part G[m,n]− does not contribute in the considered time limit because of the theta functions that appear
explicitly in Eqs. (14) and (16). Therefore the particle part may be replaced by the full Green’s function when
the time ordering is treated properly.

11

We now introduce the inelastic improper self energy T (ω) in analogy to the common improper or reducible self
energy [12,6] by rewriting Eq. (50) as usual by

G(ω) = G(0)(ω) + G(0)(ω) T (ω) G(0)(ω),

T (ω) = A(ω) + A(ω) G(0)(ω) T (ω).

Following the derivations of Refs. [6,41] we can express the scattering S-matrix by the improper self energy:

S(p′m ← pn) = δnmδpp′ − 2πi T [m,n]

p′p

(εp + E0n) δ(εp′ + E0m − εp − E0n).

The inelastic improper self energy T [m,n] at the scattering energy εp + E0n can thus be identiﬁed with the on-shell
T -matrix of scattering theory. Following standard scattering theory, we see from Eq. (56) that the inelastic self energy
A[m,n](ω) (or equivalently the dynamical self energy A(ω)) presents the (optical) potential for the scattering process.
A[m,n] is the optical potential for multichannel scattering where the channels are deﬁned by the eigenstates |φni of
the nuclear motion.

The relation of the inelastic improper self energy T to the improper self energy T of the usual (electronic) single-
particle Green’s function ( [12,6], see also [48] for explicit expressions that can be useful in the present context) can
be described, in analogy to Eq. (44), by

T [m,n](ω) = hφm| T (ω − Hn + E00) |φni.

Note that this formal expression in fact expresses a rather complicated relation of the purely electronic improper self
energy T (ω) and the inelastic scattering T -matrix because the nuclear kinetic energy in Hn formally appears as an
energy variable of T (ω), which has itself a complicated dependence on the nuclear coordinates R. If, however, Tn is
omitted in this expression replacing Hn by V0(R), we can recover the well-known adiabatic-nuclei approximation (an)
of electron-molecule scattering:

T [m,n](an)
p′p

(ω) = hφm| Tp′p(ω − V0(R) + E00) |φni.

B. An eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation

In the preceding section we identiﬁed the inelastic self energy A[m,n] with the optical potential for multi-channel
scattering. Consequently, eﬀective one-particle equations of the Lippmann-Schwinger or Schr¨odinger type can be
derived. In the multichannel picture one obtains sets of coupled equations, one for each combination of initial and
Instead of rederiving these equations, which can be found in Ref. [41] for the analogous case of
ﬁnal channel.
electronically inelastic scattering, we will discuss directly the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation in the position-
space representation.

Any eﬀective one-particle equation must involve explicitly the coordinates of the scattering electron and the labels

of the nuclear states or, equivalently, the nuclear coordinates R. Instead of the full scattering wavefunction

which is the nuclear-coordinate representation of the scattering wavefunction of Eq. (53) and presents a wavefunction

wavefunction f (r, R) by

as follows by analogy from Refs. [41,5,6]. A self-contained derivation of this equation using projection operators will
also be given in Sec. IV C. In the eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation (64), E denotes the total energy with respect to
the zero point deﬁned at the molecular ground-state energy E00. This zero point is related to a situation where the
scattering electron is so far away that it does not feel any forces exerted by the target, which is in its ground state,
and the particle as well as the projectile are at rest. The zeroth-order electronic Hamiltonian He,0 is an operator
acting only on the coordinates r of the scattering electron. According to the choice of Sec. IV A, it consists of the
electronic kinetic energy and describes the motion of a free electron. Eq. (64), however, is also valid if the Hartree-Fock
operator is chosen as the zeroth order. In this case, He,0 contains also the static-exchange potential of the target
molecule. The nuclear Hamiltonian Hn acts only on the nuclear coordinates R and describes the nuclear motion
of the target molecule in its electronic-ground-state potential V0(R). The dynamical self energy A(E) of Eqs. (43)
and (44) appears here in the coordinate-space representation and takes account of the complex many-body nature of
the molecular target. It acts as a nonlocal (integral) operator in the electron coordinates r and also in the nuclear
coordinates R:

A(E) f (r, R) =

dR′

dr′ A(r, R, r′, R′, E) f (r′, R′).

Z

Z

Introducing the operator

L(E) = He,0 + Hn + A(E) − E00,

which can be seen as an analogue of the Layzer operator [49] of the usual single-particle Green’s function, the eﬀective
Schr¨odinger equation (64) can be written as

L(E)f (r, R) = E f (r, R).

This is formally a pseudo-eigenvalue equation because the eigenvalue E also determines the operator L(E). In the
scattering regime (E > 0) there is, of course, a solution for every E and the problem of solving Eq. (67) is to ﬁnd
a wavefunction f (r, R) with the correct boundary conditions such that the equation is fulﬁlled at a given scattering
energy E. We usually identify the dynamical self energy A(E) with the dynamical optical potential although A(E)
is not the only non-kinetic-energy component of L(E).

As it stands, the eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation (64) or (67) is an exact equation but, of course, approximations have
to be introduced in most cases to determine the integro-diﬀerential operator L(E). We will discuss some possibilities
in Sec. IV D. The best strategy to solve Eq. (64) then certainly depends on the level of approximation introduced
in the determination of L(E) and on the nature of the problem to be solved. A variety of methods is available.
E. g. close-coupling [27,28] or the other methods mentioned in Sec. I can be used to solve Eq. (64) directly for the
scattering wavefunctions. Resonances may also be calculated using bound-state techniques by employing the complex-
rotation method [50,51], complex absorbing potentials [52–54], or the stabilisation method [55], etc. If necessary, the
eigenvalues E may be found by iteration. Any other standard method for solving scattering problems will also do,
since the corresponding Lippmann-Schwinger or eﬀective time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation may also be used as
starting points.

C. A direct derivation of the scattering equations

We will now show how to derive the eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation (64) directly from the Schr¨odinger equation for
the full scattering problem, which comprises the motion of N + 1 electrons and the nuclear motion. This derivation
is fully equivalent to the derivation sketched in Sec. IV A. Although the dynamical Green’s function and its Dyson
equation do not appear explicitly, the direct derivation, which uses projection operators in a composite Hilbert space
with particle and hole states, is ﬁrmly based on Green’s function theory and has to be seen as the result of recent
developments in this area [42,43]. While traditional many-body Green’s function theory supplies powerful methods
to compute the dynamical optical potential approximatively (see Sec. IV D), the projection operator formulation of
Dyson’s equation [43] yields a complementary way of reﬂecting on the Green’s function approach and its relation to

13

Feshbach projection. Reconsidering in this section the algebra of Sec. III will help us to further clarify the role of an
R-dependence in the electronic single-particle basis and in the electronic ground-state |ΨN
0 i. We will also have an
opportunity to discuss the role of unphysical contaminations of the optical wavefunction.

We start from the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation for the full scattering problem of N + 1 electrons and

the atomic nuclei:

(H − E00) |Ψtot(R)i = E |Ψtot(R)i.

The total wavefunction |Ψtot(R)i is an arbitrary solution of the Schr¨odinger equation like, e. g., the scattering
p (R)i of Eq. (60). The eigenvalue E measures the energy of the scattering system relative to the
wavefunction |Ψn+
molecular ground state energy E00. Following Eq. (9), we split the total Hamiltonian H into the electronic part He
and the nuclear kinetic energy Tn. Adding and subtracting the ground-state potential V0(R) and introducing the
nuclear Hamiltonian Hn = Tn + V0(R) of Eq. (10), we may write

[He − V0(R) + Hn − E00] |Ψtot(R)i = E |Ψtot(R)i.

By introducing the 2 × 2 matrix operator ˘H of Eq. (24) we may rewrite Eq. (69) into the two-component equation

completely equivalent to the initial Schr¨odinger equation (68). However, the vector ( |Ψtot(R)i, 0)t may also be seen
as an element of the composite Y-space of Note [45]. We now introduce the projection operator

projecting onto the primary space, which is spanned by the vectors {|Ypi} of Eq. (23). By deﬁnition, the projector P
primarily acts on the electronic degrees of freedom. However, we also have to consider the dependence on the nuclear
coordinates R because the nuclear kinetic energy Tn contained in the nuclear Hamiltonian Hn introduces derivatives
with respect to R into Eq. (70). The nuclear-coordinate dependence of P derives directly from the electronic ground
state |ΨN
0 i, as can be seen from the deﬁnition (23) of |Ypi when we assume that the basis of single-particle orbitals
ϕp(r) is independent of R. Since the primary space and consequently the projector P are invariant under a change of
the single-particle basis, this also holds true when R-dependent orbitals like, e. g., Hartree-Fock orbitals are chosen, as
long as they from a complete basis of the single-particle space. Consequently a formulation employing the projection
operators P and Q = 1 − P remains independent of the choice of the single-particle basis and thus an R-dependence
of the orbitals does not matter.

We already discussed in Sec. III B that we want to adopt the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the electronic
0 i. In particular we assume the R-dependence of the electronic ground state |ΨN
ground state |ΨN
0 i to be weak. As
a consequence, the projection operator P commutes with the nuclear kinetic energy Tn and therefore also with Hn:

[P , Tn] = [P , Hn] = 0.

(72)

We want to stress once more that we assume the Born-Oppenheimer approximation only for the nuclear motion in
the electronic ground state of the N -electron molecule, which is physically reasonable for many molecules. However,
this neither implies adiabaticity for the scattering electron nor for excited states of the scattering complex. By way
of contrast, the nonadiabatic coupling of the projectile motion to the nuclear motion, which can be very important
for slow projectiles, is explicitly accounted for in our formalism.

Deﬁning the operator Q = 1 − P as a projector onto the secondary space (1 is here the identity operator in Y-space

This is the resulting form of the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation projected to the primary space. The projected
component fulﬁls a pseudo-eigenvalue equation with an energy-dependent operator on the left-hand side. This operator
acts on the nuclear coordinates R and on the electronic coordinates, but only within the primary space, which is
isomorphous to the one-particle space (as was discussed in Sec. III A).

In the following we will make contact to our previous formulation and identify the self energy of the dynamical

The eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation in the form of Eq. (64) is obtained when using the coordinate representation instead
of the orbital representation for the scattering electron and realising that the matrix ε is the orbital representation
of the operator He,0 of Eq. (32) in the one-electron space. As discussed earlier in this subsection, the projection
operators P and Q are completely independent of the choice of the single-particle basis and thus Eq. (79) holds in the
momentum, in the coordinate-space, and in arbitrary orbital representations. We are also not restricted to a particular
choice of the zeroth-order electronic Hamiltonian He,0, represented by the matrix ε in Eq. (79). Any single-particle
operator, which may or may not depend on R, is possible. A convenient choice for the electron-molecule scattering
problem is certainly to choose the Hartree-Fock operator for He,0 because this simpliﬁes the calculation of the self
energy A(ω). In this case, He,0 contains the electronic kinetic energy as well as the static exchange potential.

So far, we have proven that the projection f (r, R) of Eq. (61) of the physical scattering wavefunction fulﬁls the
eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation (64). There are also unphysical solutions of this equation due to the introduction of
the second component in Eq. (70). The unphysical component lives in the Hilbert space of N − 1 electrons, coupled
to the same nuclear degrees of freedom as the physical component. Since the Hamiltonian for the second component
from Eq. (70) is given by

V0(R) − He + Hn − E00 = −[He − Tn − 2V0(R) + E00],

(80)

the nuclear dynamics is not treated in the correct way to describe an ionised molecule because He and Tn have
opposite sign.
If we want to apply the formalism of the dynamical optical potential to describe the dynamics of
ionised molecules, the deﬁnition of the Hamiltonian has to be changed accordingly.

15

Coming back to the description of the electron-scattering problem we want to consider the question of how to
identify unphysical solutions and whether the unphysical component can interfere with the physical solutions. The
answer to these questions is easily given when the scattering boundary conditions are obeyed correctly: Since the
electronic ground state of the scattering target |ΨN
0 i is a square-
integrable function of r vanishing asymptotically for |r| → ∞. Consequently, the same holds true for the eﬀective
wavefunction f unphys(r, R) belonging to an unphysical solution of Eq. (70)

0 i represents a bound state, any overlap hΨ| ψ(r) |ΨN

as a function of r. As long as one solves the eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation (64) or the corresponding Lippmann-
Schwinger equation imposing scattering boundary conditions on the eﬀective wavefunction f (r, R), one obtains a
physical solution. Even a contamination of the physical solution with a short-range unphysical solution will do no
harm because for the calculation of the S-matrix elements only the asymptotic behaviour of the eﬀective wavefunction
enters.

Let us brieﬂy examine the only approximation made in the derivation of Eq. (75). Without the approximation (72),
which allowed the commutation of the nuclear kinetic energy Tn with the projection operators P and Q, additional
terms proportional to P HnQ and QHnP appear in the projected Schr¨odinger equation. These terms describe virtual
excitations from the primary to the secondary space, which mean an electronic excitation in the target molecule,
mediated by the nuclear kinetic energy operator. These terms compete with excitations by the electronic Hamiltonian
P HeQ and QHeP against which they can usually be neglected. The only exemption may be given in cases where
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the electronic ground state fails and the potential surfaces of the electronic
ground and excited states of the target molecule come close to each other. In these rare cases, the vibronic interactions
have to be accounted for and a diabatic representation for the ground state may be adequate. The dynamical optical
potential then has to be augmented by terms that describe the corresponding vibronic transitions.

D. Approximative scattering equations

In this subsection we want to discuss diﬀerent approximations to the exact scattering equations and the physical
models these approximations imply. In the ﬁrst two points we will consider possibilities to regain well-known approx-
imate descriptions of electron-molecule scattering by either neglecting the energy-dependent optical potential or by
freezing the nuclear degrees of freedom in the exact equation (67). In the last two points we will concentrate on the
dynamical optical potential itself. Apart from discussing the role of the nuclear dynamics within the optical potential
we will show how to compute ab initio dynamical optical potentials.

1. Static approximations to the optical potential

First of all we want to consider the simplest of all approximations to the optical potential, which results by neglecting
the optical potential A(ω) altogether. Formally this approximation is equivalent to neglecting the interaction part
He,1 in the electronic Hamiltonian He of Eq. (31). This equivalence follows easily from Eq. (44) which connects the
dynamical self energy A(ω) to the usual self energy Σ(ω), which is by deﬁnition at least of ﬁrst order in He,1 [12].
In other words we can say that, neglecting the dynamical self energy A(ω), the eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation (64) is
still exact for physical systems where the scattering electron is not correlated with other electrons in the system and
thus is well described by He,0. The one-particle operator He,0 may still contain mean ﬁelds or forces exerted by the
atomic nuclei or external ﬁelds, of course.

The level of approximation gained with the resulting static (i. e. energy-independent) Layzer operator Lst =

He,0 + Hn − E00 depends on the choice of the zeroth-order electronic Hamiltonian He,0:

• Choosing He,0 to describe the electronic kinetic energy yields a Layzer operator Lst that describes the separable

motion of a free electron and a vibrating or rotating target molecule in its electronic ground state.

• Choosing instead He,0 to describe the R-dependent Hartree-Fock operator yields a static Layzer operator that
describes the motion of the scattering electron under the inﬂuence of the static and the exchange interactions
with the Hartree-Fock charge cloud of the target molecule coupled to the nuclear motion in the usual electronic-
ground-state potential V0(R) augmented by the Coulomb attraction between the nuclei and the electronic
projectile. This approximation gives a consistent treatment of the electron-molecule scattering problem in the

16

strict single-particle picture. Projectile and nuclear motion are fully coupled but the very nature of this static
approximation excludes polarisation eﬀects as well as the possibility of electronic excitation of the target caused
by the impact of the scattering projectile. Another defect of this Hartree-Fock based static-exchange approxi-
mation is that the static charge cloud of the target molecule is only described in an approximate (uncorrelated)
manner through the Hartree-Fock wavefunction.

Another straightforward possibility for an energy-independent approximation to the dynamical optical potential
is to include the high-energy limit of the self energy A(∞), which is also called the static self energy. The static
part of the dynamical self energy A(∞) is identical to the purely-electronic static self energy Σ(∞), as can be seen
from Eqs. (35) and (43) [see also Eq. (44)]. As shown in Ref. [56], this nonlocal operator can be interpreted to
improve the static-exchange interaction beyond the Hartree-Fock description of the target wavefunction including
target correlation. The present approximation to the Layzer operator Lcse = He,0 + Hn + A(∞) − E00 is independent
of the choice of the zeroth-order electronic Hamiltonian He,0 in Eq. (31) because the static self energy takes account
of the interaction term He,1. The Layzer operator Lcse corresponds to a scattering potential that originates from a
correlated but static charge distribution of the target molecule, which is also known as the correlated static exchange
(cse) potential.

Approximations to the energy-dependent part of the dynamical optical potential in the context of the fully coupled
In the following paragraph we will consider the

scattering problem will be discussed in Secs. IV D 3 and IV D 4.
simpliﬁed case where the nuclear dynamics is neglected altogether.

2. Fixed-nuclei scattering

Let us recall that the full Layzer operator L may be expressed with the help of Eq. (44) by

L(E) = He,0 + Tn + V0(R) + Σ(E − Tn − V0(R) + E00) − E00.

In the limit of inﬁnitely heavy nuclei, the nuclear kinetic energy Tn can be neglected. We call this limit the ﬁxed-nuclei
(fn) limit because the Layzer operator

Lfn(E) = He,0 + Σ(E − V0(R) + E00) + V0(R) − E00

and the corresponding scattering wavefunction f (r, R) of Eq. (64) now depend only parametrically on the nuclear
coordinates R. The operator Lfn(E) is exactly the Layzer operator used in the literature for electron scattering from
atoms or rigid molecules [4,49,5] apart from the R-dependent energy shift V0(R) − E00. This energy shift resets the
zero point of the energy scale from E00 to V0(R).

In the present case of ﬁxed-nuclei scattering, the optical potential is given by the purely electronic self energy Σ(ω).
As mentioned earlier, the static part Σ(∞) improves the static-exchange potential with respect to the correlation of
the targets electronic ground state wavefunction. The energy-dependent part M (ω) = Σ(ω) − Σ(∞) is, according to
Eq. (35), given by

(82)

(83)

(84)

M (ω) = ˘H ab

1
ω1 − ˘H bb

˘H ba.

For convenience, we again resort to the matrix notation for electronic coordinates used already in the preceding
chapters. Of course, the matrices can also be expressed in the coordinate representation. M (ω) accounts for the
so-called dynamic correlation including the polarisation of the target by the incident projectile electron [57]. The
energy dependence of M (ω) has been studied in the literature [58] and the consequences of the energy dependence of
optical potentials for scattering systems have been discussed [2]. Here, we brieﬂy want to remark the following:

bb

M (ω) introduces poles and branch cuts in the optical potential, which can be found by diagonalising the denominator
of Eq. (84). The matrix ˘H
in the denominator is already diagonal in zeroth order, e. g. in the Hartree-Fock
approximation. The diagonal elements correspond to electronic excitations of the (N + 1)- and (N − 1)-electron
systems and can be classiﬁed by conﬁgurations of 2p − h, 3p − 2h, etc. character as well as conﬁgurations of p − 2h,
2p − 3h type, and so on. Explicit matrix representations for ˘H ab, ˘H ba, and ˘H bb can be found in Ref. [42].

For the calculation of Σ(ω), standard approximation schemes are available. The so-called algebraic diagrammatic
construction (ADC) scheme [14], for example, yields a perturbation-theory-based hierarchy of approximations for
Σ(ω) that preserve the analytic structure of this function of ω, in contrast to ordinary perturbation theory, which
does not. The ADC approximation to Σ(ω) has the structure of Eq. (35) but the matrices ˘H ij are constructed in

17

the nth order ADC scheme such that the perturbation expansion of the approximate ΣADC(ω) with respect to the
electronic interaction He,1 of Eq. (31) coincides up to nth order with the usual Feynman-Dyson perturbation series
of Σ(ω).

Since the poles and cuts relating to the ionised molecule (N − 1 electrons) appear at negative energies, they only
have a weak inﬂuence on the energy-dependence of the optical potential at the relevant scattering energies. The poles
and cuts at positive energies, however, can be associated with excited states of the (N + 1)-electron scattering system.
Signatures of Feshbach resonances therefore can be found in the dynamic part of the optical potential although the
exact resonance position and width, of course, have to be calculated from the full eﬀective Hamiltonian. A branch
cut will appear in the analytic structure of Σ(ω) above the ﬁrst excitation energy of the target molecule because with
suﬃcient energy for an electronic excitation, a new channel opens and inelastic scattering becomes possible. The
branch cut of Σ(ω) has the consequence that the optical potential acquires an imaginary component and becomes
non-hermitian, thereby accounting for the loss of amplitude in the channel of electronically elastic scattering.

3. Nuclear dynamics in the optical potential: Expansion with respect to Tn

We are now going to discuss the inﬂuences of the nuclear motion on the dynamical optical potential A(E). The
dynamical self energy A(E) as given by Eq. (43) consists of an energy-independent (static) part A(∞) and an energy-
dependent part M(E) = A(E) − A(∞), which vanishes for large energies E. The energy-dependent part M(E)
includes all eﬀects of dynamic correlation including polarisation but is now modiﬁed with respect to the ﬁxed-nuclei
case considered in Sec. IV D 2. As follows from Eq. (43), the energy-dependent part reads in matrix notation:

M(E) = ˘H ab

1
[E − Tn − V0(R) + E00]1 − ˘H

˘H ba.

bb

(85)

Like before, Tn denotes the nuclear kinetic energy, V0(R) the (electronic) ground-state potential, E is the scattering
energy, and E00 the molecular ground-state energy. The matrices ˘H ij are the partial matrix representations of the
two-component electronic excitation-energy operator ˘H, like introduced in Sec. III A, and depend on the nuclear
coordinates R. In order to diagonalise the denominator to ﬁnd the pole structure of M(E), not only eigenvectors of
˘H bb corresponding to electronic eigenstates in the secondary space are necessary but instead one also has to consider
the additional degrees of freedom of nuclear motion. Since the energies usually associated to the nuclear dynamics are
much smaller than typical energies of electronic excitations, we may assume that the coarse structure of the energy
dependence does not diﬀer much from the ﬁxed-nuclei case discussed in Sec. IV D 2. However, the nuclear dynamics
will introduce a ﬁne structure and may become very important, either at energies where electronic excitation is
possible or nearly possible, or in situation that are very sensitive to disturbance of the scattering potential, e. g. close
to vibrationally inelastic thresholds.

As long as the scattering energies are safely away from Feshbach resonances or inelastic thresholds, the inﬂuences of
nuclear dynamics on the optical potential itself may either be neglected or accounted for approximately by expansions
of the denominator in Eq. (85). We will now proceed to discuss two convenient expansions for M(E).

Closest in spirit to the before-discussed ﬁxed-nuclei approximation is the assumption that Tn represents a small

perturbation, suggesting the following type of expansion:

= Σ(E − V0(R) + E00).

(87)

Formally, the adiabatic optical potential Aaop(E) coincides with the optical potential used in ﬁxed-nuclei scattering
in Sec. IV D 2. The diﬀerence is that the nuclear coordinates R are now dynamical variables. The adiabatic optical
potential Aaop(E) is a local operator on the nuclear coordinates R because V0 and the matrices ˘H ij depend on R
but there are no derivatives with respect to R in Aaop(E). Since Aaop(E) can be calculated, for each R, from the
purely electronic self energy Σ(E), standard techniques for calculating the electronic self energy like the ADC method
mentioned in Sec. IV D 2 can be applied.

18

The Layzer operator corresponding to the presently discussed approximative treatment of the dynamical optical

potential Aaop(E) is given by

Laop(E) = He,0 + Hn + Aaop(E) − E00.

(88)

Although the dynamical optical potential is treated here in an adiabatic approximation, the Layzer operator Laop(E)
describes the fully and non-adiabatically coupled motion of the projectile electron and the atomic nuclei with a
simpliﬁed optical potential. In this approximation, the nuclear dynamics in the electronically excited states of the
target is treated adiabatically. Even though this approximation may not be justiﬁed when describing experiments
probing in detail the electronic excitation structure of the target, the situation is diﬀerent for scattering at low but not
too low energies. When electronic excitations are forbidden by energy conservation because the electron-impact energy
is too low, the adiabatic approximation Aaop(E) may be very good. At low impact energies, electronic excitation then
is still possible as a virtual process leading to polarisation of the molecule but obeying the energy-time uncertainty
relation. When the typical times for these virtual excitations are much smaller than the time scales of nuclear
vibrations, which will usually be the case, then the ﬁxed-nuclei approximation for the dynamical optical potential
Aaop(E) is adequate.

For very slow scattering electrons, on the other hand, it may also be necessary to improve the approximation
Aaop(E), when the cross sections probe the details of the optical potential very sensitively. In the adiabatic optical
potential Aaop(E), the dynamical relaxation of the nuclear structure during the polarisation of the electronic charge
cloud induced by the incoming projectile is not treated properly. At very low projectile velocities where the trajectories
are most sensitive on the coupling to the nuclear motion this may become an important defect of the theory. In this
case the expansion of the dynamical optical potential discussed in the next subsection, which allows for an approximate
treatment of the neglected eﬀects, becomes most valuable.

4. Expansion of the dynamical optical potential with respect to Hn − E00

The nuclear kinetic energy operator Tn introduces derivatives with respect to the nuclear coordinates R in the terms
of the expansion (86) for ν ≥ 1. In general, these terms will be diﬃcult to evaluate because the approximate and
also the exact matrices ˘H ij may depend strongly on the nuclear coordinates R due to the electron-nucleon Coulomb
repulsion contained in ˘H. Another expansion that is better suited for higher-order approximations is obtained when
taking Tn +V0(R)−E00 = Hn −E00 as the “small” perturbation. The assumption that Hn −E00 may be regarded small
in the denominator of Eq. (85) is justiﬁed when the energies associated to nuclear excitations appearing during the
scattering process and possibly during (virtual) electronic excitations are small compared to the electronic excitation
energies of the target. The corresponding expansion of the energy-dependent part of the dynamical self energy reads

The ﬁrst term M0(E) of this expansion (ν = 0) can be identiﬁed as the energy-dependent (dynamic) part of the
purely electronic self energy (84) and will be called the zero-point optical potential because it reﬂects the optical
potential of ground-state nuclear motion:

form the ground-state potential V0(R) and approximate matrices ˘H ij are available, e. g., by the ADC approximation
as described above in Sec. IV D 2.

Eq. (90) is remarkable because it allows us to estimate the importance of the higher-order terms in the expansion
(89). If the nuclear dynamics of the target molecule, in spite of virtual excitations by the scattering electron, can
be approximated well by the zero-point vibration of the isolated molecule (in its electronic ground state) then all
terms with k 6= 0 in Eq. (90) can be neglected. Since, however, the energy diﬀerence [E0k − E00] vanishes for k = 0,
In this approximation only the zeroth term M0(E)

contributes in the expansion of the dynamical optical potential.
In other words M(E) is a local operator in the
nuclear coordinates if the nuclear-coordinate dependence of the eﬀective scattering wavefunction f (r, R) is given by
the nuclear eigenfunction φ0(R) and the R dependence of the matrices ˘H bb and ˘H ba can be neglected. This will not
always be the case. However, it can also be tested during a calculation for which values of k the integral

gives the largest contribution. The approximation M0(E) can then be improved by expanding around Hn − ˜E, where
˜E is a suitably chosen mean vibrational (rotational) energy, instead of Hn − E00, yielding the zeroth approximation

and the corresponding higher approximations like in Eq. (89).

The diﬀerence between the adiabatic optical potential Aaop(E) and the zero-point optical potential A0(E) or
the improved approximation A˜0(E) lies in the energy reference of the denominator of the optical potential. We
expect A0(E) or A˜0(E) to be suitable approximations for A(E) when the nuclear motion is more or less conﬁned
to the immediate surroundings of the equilibrium conﬁguration Req of the molecule.
In particular for processes
that travel between diﬀerent levels on the potential energy surface V0(R) corresponding to a considerable transfer
of energy between the projectile and target like it happens in associative detachment or dissociative attachment,
we expect the adiabatic approximation Aaop(E) to be the better-suited approximation. However, we want to stress
once again that the treatment of the nuclear dynamics within the optical potential is certainly less essential than
the direct coupling between projectile and nuclear motion in the eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation (64), as long as the
scattering energy remains well below the threshold for electronic excitation of the molecular target. The expansion
(89) presents a systematic possibility to improve upon the adiabatic or the zero-point approximation that is applicable
if the scattering process has too little energy to access the electronically excited states of the target. The ﬁrst-order
term M1 of Eq. (90) and the corresponding higher approximations provide access to a systematic improvement of
the discussed approximations for ab initio methods of quantum chemistry that may prove necessary to describe the
dynamical couplings correctly for very-low-energy scattering processes that are particularly sensitive to the correct
description of the optical potential. If the scattering energy is above or close to the threshold for electronic excitation
of the target molecule, the eﬀective Schr¨odinger equation (64) still remains valid but other approximations to the
dynamical optical potential have to be used.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have derived a rigorous optical potential for the coupled motion of the projectile electron and
the atomic nuclei in electron-molecule scattering. The dynamical optical potential should be particularly valuable for
studying the non-adiabatic coupling of projectile and nuclear motion close to inelastic thresholds where the projectile
velocity is comparable to the typical velocities of nuclear motion. Our work extends the well-known many-body
formalism of optical potentials beyond the ﬁxed-nuclei approximation. On the other hand the rigorous derivation
and the explicit expressions given for the dynamical optical potential provide a justiﬁcation and prospective for
enhancement of model polarisation potentials used commonly in close-coupling and R-matrix calculations.

The dynamical optical potential can describe all kinds of electronically elastic scattering processes such as elastic
scattering, vibrational or rotational excitation (de-excitation), dissociative attachment, and associative detachment.
Also when electronic excitations are energetically accessible, the dynamical optical potential may be used to calculate
the (electronically) elastic partial cross sections as well as resonance positions and widths.

One central result of the present work is that for scattering energies far enough away from electronic excitations of
the target, the dynamical optical potential is given in a ﬁrst approximation by the static-exchange potential augmented
by the ﬁxed-nuclei self energy Σ(ω) of the purely electronic Green’s function. This approximation, which yields a

20

local operator with respect to the nuclear coordinates R, can be improved by a hierarchy of non-local terms. Due to
the close relation to the usual self energy Σ(ω), all terms can be calculated with standard ab-initio methods using
well-deﬁned approximation schemes.

The dynamical optical potential provides a ﬁrm basis for theoretical studies of coupled projectile and nuclear motion
in ultra-low-energy electron-molecule scattering, which is becoming a vivid ﬁeld of interest due to recent experimental
advances (see e. g. [59]). The eﬀective scattering equations presented in this paper can be solved, e. g. by using
close-coupling expansions or other time-independent techniques. We expect that particularly valuable insight into the
mechanisms of the scattering process, however, can be gained by time-dependent wave-packet calculations. Solving
these scattering equations certainly remains a numerically demanding task but becomes more and more feasible now
with state of the art computing facilities and the advancement of numerical methods [60].

[40] So far authors have only treated the J = 0 case, ignoring the problems of higher angular momenta. In principle, they can
be treated in the PO formalism but parameters for the angular momentum couplings are diﬃcult to calculate directly and
diﬃcult to model as well. See, e. g. W. Domcke and C. M¨undel, J. Phys. B 18, 4491 (1985), J. Hor´aˇcek, M. ˇC´ıˇzek, and
W. Domcke, Theor. Chem. Acc., in press.

[45] The vectors |Ypi may be understood as elements of a composite Hilbert space Y that is a direct sum of the N + 1 particle
space and the dual space of the N − 1 particle space Y = H(N+1) ⊕ H(N−1)∗
where N is the number of electrons of the
target molecule. The primary space, which is spanned by the composite states |Ypi, is only a (small) subspace of Y. The
secondary space is deﬁned by the orthogonal complement of the primary space in Y.

[47] The present derivation of Dyson’s equation can also be formulated without reference to a particular basis of the primary
or secondary space with the help of projection operators analogous to the derivation of the optical potential in Sec. IV C
(see Ref. [43]). The R dependence of the projection operators is well-deﬁned and derives only from the electronic ground
state |ΨN

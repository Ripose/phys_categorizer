The statistical properties of the dissipation process constrain the analysis of large scale numerical
simulations of three dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, such
as those of Biskamp and M¨uller [Phys. Plasmas 7, 4889 (2000)]. The structure functions of the
turbulent ﬂow are expected to display statistical self-similarity, but the relatively low Reynolds
numbers attainable by direct numerical simulation, combined with the ﬁnite size of the system, make
this diﬃcult to measure directly. However, it is known that extended self-similarity, which constrains
the ratio of scaling exponents of structure functions of diﬀerent orders, is well satisﬁed. This implies
the extension of physical scaling arguments beyond the inertial range into the dissipation range.
The present work focuses on the scaling properties of the dissipation process itself. This provides
an important consistency check in that we ﬁnd that the ratio of dissipation structure function
exponents is that predicted by the She and Leveque [Phys. Rev. Lett 72, 336 (1994)] theory
proposed by Biskamp and M¨uller. This supplies further evidence that the cascade mechanism
in three dimensional MHD turbulence is non-linear random eddy scrambling, with the level of
intermittency determined by dissipation through the formation of current sheets.

INTRODUCTION

This paper investigates the previously under explored topic of scaling in the local rate of dissipation in magne-
tohydrodynamic (MHD) ﬂows. Turbulent ﬂuids and plasmas display three properties that motivate development
of statistical theories [1]: (i) disorganisation, in the sense that structures arise on all scales; (ii) unpredictability of
detailed behaviour, in the sense of inability to predict a signal’s future behaviour from knowledge of its past, implying
links with deterministic chaos; and (iii) reproducibility of statistical measures, combined with the presence of statisti-
cal self-similarity. Much progress has been made by the heuristic treatment of scaling laws derived from energy cascade
arguments, following Kolmogorov and Richardson, see for example Ref.[1]. The basic idea is that energy-carrying
structures (eddies) are injected on large scales, non-linear eddy interaction causes energy to cascade to smaller scales
in a self-similar manner, and energy is ﬁnally dissipated by viscosity on small scales. A quasi-stationary state evolves
where the rate of viscous dissipation matches the rate of energy injection. Scaling exponents ζp characterise the
resulting statistical self-similarity found in structure functions Sp
l :

l = h(v(x + l, t).l/l − v(x, t).l/l)pi ∼ lζp
Sp
Here v is the ﬂuid velocity, x is a position vector, l is a diﬀerencing vector, and the average is an ensemble average.
The statistical self-similarity represented by the power-law in l is only valid within the inertial range ld ≪ l ≪ l0;
here l0 is the characteristic macroscale, and ld is the dissipation scale at which the cascade terminates. The set
of scaling exponents ζp in Eq.(1) is expected to be universal since it characterises the generic cascade process. It

is worth noting here that universality can only be expected in the isotropic case. When anisotropies are present,
deviation from the isotropic case can be expected, and this will relate to the strength of the anisotropy. In MHD
turbulence, anisotropy can be introduced in the form of an imposed magnetic ﬁeld. The eﬀect of this on the scaling
exponents is investigated in Ref.[2]. This reference also investigates anisotropy in terms of that introduced by the
local magnetic ﬁeld even when an applied ﬁeld in absent. This stems from the Goldreich and Sridhar objection to the
assumption of local isotropy in the MHD case [3]. In Ref.[2] structure functions are calculated with the diﬀerencing
length perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld. The perpendicular structure functions were found to
exhibit stronger intermittency than the parallel structure functions. Exponents calculated from the perpendicular
structure functions were found to coincide with those calculated from the isotropic structure functions. Essentially
dimensional arguments, in which the relevant physical parameters are identiﬁed heuristically, have been formulated
to provide basic ﬂuid scaling information. These arguments linearly relate ζp to p, for example the Kolmogorov 1941
phenomenology [4, 5] predicts ζp = p/3. As such, basic ﬂuid scaling can be characterised by one number a such that

To exploit these concepts, let us write the equations of incompressible MHD in Els¨asser symmetric form [6]:

Here the Els¨asser ﬁeld variables are z± = v ± B (µ0ρ)− 1
2 , where p is the scalar pressure, ν is kinematic viscosity,
η is magnetic diﬀusivity and ρ is ﬂuid density. The symmetry of Eq.(3) suggests that statistical treatment of z±
may be more fundamental than separate treatments of v and B. In light of this, longitudinal structure functions are
constructed in terms of Els¨asser ﬁeld variables hereafter:

As mentioned above, heuristic arguments that make predictions about basic ﬂuid scaling only linearly relate ζp to p.
In reality ζp depends nonlinearly on p due to the intermittent spatial distribution of eddy activity. Basic ﬂuid scaling
can be modiﬁed to take this into account by the application of an intermittency correction. A commonly applied class
of intermittency correction describes statistical self-similarity in the local rate of dissipation ǫl by means of scaling
exponents τp:

For a review of the fractal nature of the local rate of dissipation for hydrodynamics, see for example Ref.[7].

As we shall see, the intermittent nature of the system is captured by the nonlinear dependence of τp on p in
Eq.(6). This nonlinearity can conveniently be expressed multiplicatively in relation to the basic linear ﬂuid scaling
of Eq.(2). Speciﬁcally we may write

l ∼ hǫgp
Sp

l ilap

Where g is a constant whose value is inferred from model assumptions such as those of Kolmogorov (K41) and
Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK) [8, 9]. This is Kolmogorov’s reﬁned similarity hypothesis [5]. The scaling exponents ζp
in Eq.(5) are inferred by Eq.(7) to be ζp = τpg + pa. That is, the intermittency in the velocity ﬁeld structure
functions is achieved via reasoning concerning local rate of dissipation. One model that uses this hypothesis, and has
proven successful in predicting the scaling exponents for hydrodynamic turbulence, is that from the 1994 paper of
She and Leveque (SL) [10]. Here physical assumptions are made regarding the scaling of the local rate of dissipation.
Speciﬁcally: the hierarchical nature of Eq.(6) above, as expressed in Eq.(6) of Ref.[10]; the rate of dissipation by
the most intensely dissipating structures is related only to the eddy turnover time as determined by the basic ﬂuid
scaling, as in Eq.(5) of Ref.[10]; and the space ﬁlling nature of the most intensely dissipating structures can be
described by one parameter (their Hausdorﬀ dimension). These three assumptions can be combined to formulate a
second order diﬀerence equation for the scaling exponents τp that has one non-trivial solution, as in Eq.(9) of Ref.[10].
This solution can be formulated in terms of the two parameters: the co-dimension of the most intensely dissipating

structures, C = D − dH , where D is the embedding dimension and dH is the Hausdorﬀ dimension; and the basic ﬂuid
scaling number expressed by a in Eq.(2) above. Following Ref.[10], we may write

τp = −(1 − a)p + C − C(1 − (1 − a)/C)p

This two parameter formulation follows that previously noted by Dubrulle [11], whose parameters ∆ and β correspond
to our (1 − a) and 1 − ∆/C respectively. The reﬁned similarity hypothesis, as expressed in Eq.(7), is then invoked to
obtain the following expression for the structure function scaling exponents ζp:

ζp = pa − (1 − a)pg + C − C(1 − (1 − a)/C)pg

Previously Els¨asser ﬁeld structure functions have been identiﬁed with an SL model of the type Eq.(9), see for example
Refs.[12, 13, 14]. In the present paper the reﬁned similarity hypothesis for MHD is tested by applying a modiﬁed form
of Eq.(7), see Eq.(12), to the simulation data of Biskamp and M¨uller. This provides an important consistency check for
previous studies. Equation (8), which probes the multifractal properties of the local rate of dissipation, but does not
rely on the reﬁned similarity hypothesis, can also be tested directly against the simulation results, as we discuss below.

Direct numerical simulations must resolve the dissipation scale ld so that energy does not accumulate at large
wavenumbers, artiﬁcially stunting the cascade. Most of the numerical resolution is therefore used on the dissipation
range, whereas it is only on scales much larger than ld that dissipative eﬀects are negligible, and scaling laws of
the type discussed arise. Thus high Reynolds number simulations with an extensive inertial range are currently
unavailable. However, the principle of extended self-similarity (ESS) [15] can be used to extend the inertial range
scaling laws into the range of length scales that is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by dissipation but still larger than ld. Instead
of considering the scaling of individual structure functions, the principle of ESS involves investigating the scaling of
one order structure function against another, on the assumption that

Here it can be seen that any set of structure functions will satisfy this relation providing

where G(l) can be any function of l which is independent of p. Here we use the notation of S. C. Emily et al. that
these authors used to describe the general properties of generalised extended self-similarity, as expressed in Eq.(8)
of Ref.[16] – though generalised ESS is not discussed in the present paper. When the objective of ESS is to extend
scaling into the dissipation range, G(l) can be rewritten as lG′(l), where G′(l) is introduced to accommodate the non
constant ﬂux of energy through length scales in the dissipation range. As such, G′(l) asymptotically approaches one
as the length scale increases from the dissipative to the inertial range.

The She-Leveque model as it has appeared so far, is only valid in the inertial range. Let us now discuss how
this model can be interpreted in the framework of ESS. This problem has been tackled for hydrodynamic turbulence
by Dubrulle [11] for example. In that paper the explicit inclusion of l in the reﬁned similarity hypothesis [Eq.(7)
with g = ∆ = 1/3 for hydrodynamic turbulence] is replaced by a generalised length scale, which is cast in terms of
the third order structure function as expressed in Eq.(12) of Ref.[11]. This problem was addressed similarly by Benzi
et al. where the scaling relation

l i(τp/τq)

is explicitly formulated in Ref.[17]. The appropriate relation between ζp and τp is now ζp = τpg + paζ1/a. Using this
relation combined with Eq.(11) and Eq.(12) it can be seen that hǫp
l i ∼ G(l)τp. This
implies ESS exists also in the local rate of dissipation, such that

l i must also have the form hǫp

It can then be seen that if a She-Leveque model of the general type Eq.(9) is used to explain scaling exponents
obtained via ESS, as expressed in Eq.(10), then two consistency checks are appropriate. First Kolmogorov’s reﬁned
similarity hypothesis should be satisﬁed in the form Eq.(12), and second ESS should exist in the local rate of
dissipation as in Eq.(13).

The present paper performs these checks for consistency for the simulation of Biskamp and M¨uller [13]. Here
the scaling exponents ζ(±) [see Eq.(5)] were investigated via direct numerical simulation of the three dimensional (3D)
incompressible MHD equations, with a spatial grid of 5123 points [13, 18]. The simulation is of decaying turbulence
with initially equal magnetic and kinetic energy densities and ν = η. A fuller discussion of the numerical procedure
is present in the next section. Since the turbulence decays with time, structure functions are normalised by the
total energy in the simulation (kinetic plus magnetic) before time averaging takes place. Biskamp and M¨uller [13]
extracted the ratios of scaling exponents ζp/ζ3 by ESS and directly determined ζp ∼ 1. These exponents were found
to match a variant of the She-Leveque 1994 model Eq.(9) inserting Kolmogorov basic ﬂuid scaling (g = a = 1/3)
with the most intensely dissipating structures being sheet-like.(C = 1). Early investigations of this type assumed
Iroshnikov-Kraichnan ﬂuid scaling where the most intensely dissipating structures are sheet-like (see Refs.[12, 19]),
making g = a = 1/4 and C = 1. Sheet-like intensely dissipating structures are thought to exist in MHD turbulence
because of the propensity of current sheets to form. We refer to Fig.5 of Ref.[13] for isosurfaces of current density
squared, and to Fig.2 for isosurfaces constructed from the shear in the z(+) ﬁeld
. Both ﬁgures show
the existence of two dimensional coherent structures; Fig.2 is more directly related to the analyses presented in
the present paper. Basic Kolmogorov ﬂuid scaling for Alfv´enic ﬂuctuations has been veriﬁed for low Mach number
(≃ 0.1) compressible [14, 20] and incompressible [13, 18] 3D MHD turbulence by power spectrum analysis, and by
checking for scaling in the third order structure function such that ζ3 = 1. Extended self-similarity has also been
utilised to extract ratios of scaling exponents related to an inverse cascade in laboratory plasmas [21].
In other
work, a generalised version of this SL model has been applied to compressible ﬂows where C is allowed to vary as a
ﬁtting parameter [14, 22], and in the case of Ref.[22] this dimension is interpreted as a function of the sonic Mach
number. Figure 1 shows an example of the normalisation and ESS procedure for z(+) structure functions from the
data analysed here.

The philosophy behind our investigation can now be summarised as follows. Given a simulation, the set of
structure functions Sp
l can be calculated. These are expected to display statistical self-similarity as expressed in
Eq.(5), where the scaling exponents ζp give insight into the physics of the cascade process. The relatively low
Reynolds numbers attainable by direct numerical simulation, combined with the ﬁnite size of the system, make this
statistical self-similarity diﬃcult to measure directly. However, it is found that extended self-similarity of the type
expressed in Eq.(10) is well satisﬁed, allowing the ratio of scaling exponents ζp/ζ3 to be directly measured. There
is a range of a priori views concerning these ratios, reﬂecting physical model assumptions. The ratios of scaling
exponents recovered from ESS analysis of the 3D MHD simulation data are compared with these models, and the
best ﬁt is identiﬁed. Our investigation thus assists in validating the physical assumptions made in formulating the
currently favoured model, namely Eq.(9 with g = a = 1/3 and C = 1 giving ζp = p/9 + 1 − (1/3)p/3. In particular,
we conﬁrm the existence of a speciﬁc type of extended self-similarity in the local rate of dissipation, with exponents
given by Eq.(8) with a = 1/3 and C = 1 giving τp = −2p/3 + 1 − (1/3)p. We also show that Kolmogorov’s reﬁned
similarity hypothesis, in the form Eq.(12), is satisﬁed.

II. NUMERICAL PROCEDURES

The data analysed here stems from a direct numerical simulation of decaying isotropic turbulence (see Ref.[13]
for additional details). The equations of incompressible MHD are written in terms of the vorticity, ω = ∇ × v,
in order to eliminate the pressure variable. These are solved by a pseudospectral scheme (see,
for example,
Ref.[23]). Time integration is carried out by applying the trapezoidal leapfrog method [24]. The aliasing error
associated with this approach [25] is reduced to discretisation error level by spherical truncation of the Fourier grid [26].

The run was performed over ten eddy turnover times, deﬁned as the time required to reach maximum dissi-

time intervals of 0.5 between t = 3.5 and t = 9.5, during which the turbulence undergoes self-similar decay.

III. RESULTS

In the present paper, the gradient squared measure (∂iz(±)

)2 is used as a proxy [5] for the local rate of dissipation
i
(∂iBj − ∂jBi)2 η/2+(∂ivj + ∂jvi)2 ν/2. This proxy has recently been employed to study turbulence in the thermal ion
velocity of the solar wind as measured by the ACE spacecraft [27], giving results consistent with those presented below.
This is particularly interesting insofar as the solar wind remains one of the few accessible system of quasistationary
fully developed MHD turbulence [6] although we note that MHD intermittency studies have also been performed
on the reversed ﬁeld pinch experiment RFX [28]. Figure 2 shows isosurface plots of the gradient squared measure
for the simulation of Biskamp and M¨uller. Two dimensional coherent structures dominate the image, suggesting the
dimension parameter entering an SL model should equal two, as in the model employed by Biskamp and M¨uller.
Following Eq.(6), statistical self-similarity in the dissipation measure is expressed as

This proxy, which involves a one dimensional integration rather than the full 3D integration of Eq.(6), facilitates
comparison with related experimental MHD [21, 27] and hydrodynamic [7, 17, 29] studies, and also oﬀers beneﬁts in
computation time.

The SL model adopted by Biskamp and M¨uller predicts

p = −2p/3 + 1 − (1/3)p
τ (±)

l

This is simply Eq.(8) with a = 1/3 and C = 1. Gradients are calculated from the data of Biskamp and M¨uller [13]
using a high order ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme, and the integral is performed by the trapezium method. Normalisation
by the spatial average of viscous plus Ohmic rates of dissipation allows time averaging to be performed. Figure 3
shows an example of the ESS and normalisation procedure for χp(+)
order p = 5 against order p = 3. Statistical
self-similarity is recovered with roll-oﬀ from power law scaling as l aproaches the system size. This roll-oﬀ behaviour
at large l may be due to the ﬁnite size of the system, since a more extensive part of the simulation domain is
encompassed by the spatial average (the integral over dl′) as l increases in Eq.(14). In Fig.3 points identiﬁed with
this roll-oﬀ are removed, and ratio of scaling exponents (τp/τ3) is calculated from the remaining points by linear
regression. These ratios are shown in Fig.4. No signiﬁcent diﬀerence between the scaling recovered from z(+) and
z(−) can be seen. This should be expected since no theoretical distinction needs to be drawn between z(+) and z(−)
for the vanishing values of cross helicity present in this simulation. The solid line in Fig.4 shows the ratio predicted
by Eq.(15), in contrast to the dashed line which shows the ratio predicted by the SL theory for hydrodynamic
turbulence [10]. Caution must be taken when calculating high order moments, since these are strongly inﬂuenced by
the tails of their associated distributions. This can easily lead to bad counting statistics. The order p is only taken
up to p = 6.5 for the dissipation measure (instead of p = 8 as for the Els¨asser ﬁeld structure functions [13]) because
of the extremely intermittent nature of the signal; large values aﬀect the average [the angular brackets in Eq.(14)]
more as the order p increases. This eﬀect is evaluated using a similar methodology to that in Ref.[30]. If a worst
case scenario is imagined, where the average is strongly aﬀected by one point in the signal, one would expect l/δl
members of the spatial average in Eq.(14) to be directly aﬀected by this point, where δl is the grid spacing. We can
then deﬁne an event as incorporating l/δl members of the spatial average. It is found that ≃ 5 percent of the average
is deﬁned by only ≃ 10 events for order p = 6.5. This situation is of course worse for higher values of p.

Plots were constructed in order to test Eq.(12). This involves taking the product of structure functions of
the ﬁeld variables and the dissipative quantities, in contrast to Figs.1 and 3. Figures 5 and 6 show these plots for
n = 1.5 and n = 2 respectively. The low order measure in Fig.5 shows a relation that is nearly linear, with a gradient
close to the ideal value of one, see Eq.(12). This is encouraging considering the deviation expected at the smallest
and largest scales due to ﬁnite size eﬀects. However, unlike the case in Fig.3, there may be some curvature across the
range of the plot. The higher order measure in Fig.6 deviates from a linear scaling relation. We note that taking this
test to high order involves the product of two quantities that have challenging counting statistics, plotted against a
high order structure function. The deviation of the gradient seen in Fig.6 from the ideal value of one is perhaps not
surprising, because the constraints described above become stronger at high order.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

6

Extended self-similarity is recovered in the gradient squared proxy for the local rate of dissipation of the Els¨asser
ﬁeld variables z(±) computed by Biskamp and M¨uller. We believe this is the ﬁrst time this has been shown for MHD
ﬂows. This result supports the application to Els¨asser ﬁeld scaling exponents ζ(±)
of turbulence theories that require
statistical self-similarity in the local rate of dissipation, even when ζ(±)
are extracted from relatively low Reynolds
number ﬂows via ESS. Furthermore the ratio of exponents recovered is that predicted by the SL theory proposed
by Biskamp and M¨uller [13]. This supplies further evidence that the cascade mechanism in three dimensional MHD
turbulence is non-linear random eddy scrambling, with the level of intermittency determined by dissipation through
the formation of two dimensional coherent structures. However, Kolmogorov’s ESS modiﬁed reﬁned similarity
hypothesis remains to be veriﬁed at high order.

sheet-like most intensely dissipating structures, Eq.(15). The dashed line shows ratios predicted by hydrodynamic
She-Leveque [10].

FIG. 5: Plot to test Kolmogorov’s reﬁned similarity hypothesis as applied to extended self-similarity, Eq.(12).
This involves taking the product of the ﬁeld variable and dissipative structure functions, in contrast to Figs.1 and
3. Agreement with the hypothesis would give a straight line with unit gradient. Normalisation was performed as in
Figs.1 and 3 to allow time averaging despite the decay process.

FIG. 6: High order test of Kolmogorov’s reﬁned similarity hypothesis as applied to extended self-similarity,
Eq.(12). Normalisation is performed as in Fig.5.

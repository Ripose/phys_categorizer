Abstract. Recently, an increasing interest in astrophysical as well as laboratory plasmas has been manifested in reference to
the existence of relativistic ﬂows, related in turn to the production of intense electric ﬁelds in magnetized systems [1]. Such
phenomena require their description in the framework of a consistent relativistic kinetic theory, rather than on relativistic
MHD equations, subject to speciﬁc closure conditions. The purpose of this work is to apply the relativistic single-particle
guiding-center theory developed by Beklemishev and Tessarotto [2], including the nonlinear treatment of small-wavelength
EM perturbations which may naturally arise in such systems [3]. As a result, a closed set of relativistic gyrokinetic equations,
consisting of the collisionless relativistic kinetic equation, expressed in hybrid gyrokinetic variables, and the averaged
Maxwell’s equations, is derived for an arbitrary four-dimensional coordinate system.

INTRODUCTION

A basic prerequisite for the formulation of a consistent relativistic kinetic for strongly magnetized plasmas in as-
trophysical problems, is the formulation of single-particle dynamics in the context of a relativistic, fully covariant,
formulation of gyrokinetic theory [2, 3, 4]. As is well known, this regards the so-called “gyrokinetic problem”, i.e., the
description of the dynamics of a charged particle in the presence of suitably “intense” electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds re-
alized by means of appropriate perturbative expansions for its equations of motion. The expansions, usually performed
with respect to the ratio e = rL/L << 1, where L and rL are respectively a characteristic scale length of the EM ﬁelds
and the velocity-dependent particle Larmor radius rL = w
mc the Larmor frequency and w the orthogonal
s
component of a suitable particle velocity. The goal of gyrokinetic theory is to construct with prescribed accuracy in
e
the so called “gyrokinetic” or “guiding center variables”, by means of an appropriate “gyrokinetic” transformation,
such that the equations of motion result independent of the gyrophase f , f being the angle of fast gyration, which
characterizes the motion of a charged particle subject to the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld. In non-relativistic
theory the gyrokinetic transformation can be constructed by means of a perturbative expansion of the form:

In the past several methods have been devised to construct hybrid gyrokinetic variables. These include perturbative
theories based, respectively, on non-canonical methods (see for example [5]), canonical perturbation theory [6, 7],
canonical and non-canonical Lie-transform approaches [8, 9], as well as Lagrangian non-canonical formulations which
make use of the so-called hybrid Hamilton variational principle [10, 4, 2].

RELATIVISTIC GYROKINETIC THEORY: MOTIVATIONS

For a certain class of problems in plasma-physics and astrophysics, existing limitations of the standard gyrokinetic
theory [16, 17, 18, 19] make its use difﬁcult or impossible. In particular, this involves the description of experiments
in which the electric ﬁeld may become comparable in strength to the magnetic ﬁeld (so that the drift velocity becomes
relativistic), and the study of relativistic plasma ﬂows in gravitational ﬁelds, which are observed or assumed to
exist in accretion disks and related plasma jets around neutron stars, black holes, and active galactic nuclei. The
ﬁnite Larmor radius effects and the inﬂuence of short wavelength electromagnetic perturbations are also expected
to play a fundamental role in particle dynamics. In many respects, previous relativistic theory results inadeguate for
such a task. In fact, some of mearlier treatments consider the particle velocity as relativistic while its drift velocity
is not [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. This deﬁciency has been pointed out by Pozzo and Tessarotto [4], who developed a
special-relativistic theory which includes the effect of relativistic drifts. However, the self-consistent inclusion of
the gravitational ﬁelds, a prerequisite to make the theory suitable for astrophysical applications, as well the treatment
of nonlinear EM perturbations of relativistic plasmas, requires a relativistic covariant formulation. This has been
investigated by Beklemishev and Tessarotto [2, 3]. In this theory the appropriate relativistic gyrokinetic theory has
been carried out through second order in the expansion parameter, including wave ﬁelds, based on a Lagrangian
approach making use of the hybrid Hamilton variational principle. In such a case the variational functional for a
charged point particle with the rest-mass ma and charge qa in prescribed ﬁelds can be written:

S=

Qm dxm

=

(qAm (xn

) + um )dxm

,

Z

(7)

where q = qa/mac2, and variations of um occur on the seven-dimensional hypersurface um um = 1, being um
the four-
velocity um = dxm
denotes the metric tensor components,
characterizing the coordinate system (and the underlying space-time structure) which provides the connection between

ds and the relevant tensor notations are standard. Thus, gmn

the co- and countervariant components of four-vectors (henceforth referred to as 4-vectors) Am = gmn An , while the
invariant interval ds is deﬁned as

ds2 = gmn dxm dxn
where the Greek indices are assumed to go through m , n = 0, ..., 3.

THE RELATIVISTIC GYROKINETIC TRANSFORMATION

The object of gyrokinetics is to introduce a new set of phase-space variables (called the “gyrokinetic variables”)
such that the variable describing the rotation angle along the Larmor orbit (i.e. the gyrophase f ) becomes ignorable.
This happens, by deﬁnition, when the Lagrangian (or, more generally, the functional) is independent of f . Once an
ignorable variable is found, the number of corresponding Euler equations is reduced by one, and the new variables
allow simpliﬁed numerical calculations, as the motion is effectively integrated over the fast Larmor rotation. The one-
to-one transformation from the original set of phase-space variables (xm , un ) to the gyrokinetic variables is called the
“gyrokinetic transformation”. In what follows, we use the Lagrangian perturbative approach to ﬁnd those variables,
which is equivalent (in broad terms), to the Lie-transform method, though more direct.

First, we assume that the curvature radius of the space-time and the gradient lengths of the background electromag-
netic ﬁelds are much larger than the Larmor radius characterizing the particle path. However, we allow for existence of
wave-ﬁelds with sharp gradients [kr L
O(1)],
k
while such ﬁelds are assumed suitably smaller in strength than the background ﬁeld. (We stress that, unlike in conven-
tional formulations of gyrokinetic theory, this type of ordering is required in a covariant theory due to the reference-
frame dependence of the ordering assumptions involving space and time scale lengths of the perturbations.) For this
purpose we introduce the ordering scheme following the notation of [16]:

This search consists in applying the expansion (10) to the fundamental 1-form (9) and imposing the requirement
that it is independent of f

along the directions of a suitable fundamental tetrad (t , l, l′, l′′): i.e., an orthogonal basis of unit 4-vectors so that the
last three are space-like, and

(12)
which can be also regarded as the deﬁnition for the gyrophase f : it is deﬁned as an angle in the velocity-subspace,
where we introduce the cylindrical coordinate system. This deﬁnition is covariant with respect to transformations of the
space-time coordinate system, which may change the vector components, but not the vectors themselves. Furthermore,
we assume that w and ¯um are independent of f . Validity of this assumption is justiﬁed by existence of the solution (at
least for a non-degenerate Faraday tensor).

deﬁning displacements rs. This task can, in principle, be carried out systematically at any order in the relevant
expansion parameters (in particular in e ). Thus, to leading order in e

THE RELATIVISTIC GYROKINETIC VLASOV KINETIC EQUATION

F (xm , un ),
m , n = 0, ..., 3, or in the seven-dimensional phase space f (xm , un ), where only 3 components of the 4-
velocity un are independent, so that

THE MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS

Finally we point out another important feature of the present formulation of the gyrokinetic theory. Namely, the
Jacobian of the transformation is simple enough to allow explicit integration in the gyrophase, needed for evaluation of
the charge and current densities. The general form of the Maxwell’s equations in presence of an arbitrary gravitational
ﬁeld is well known[20]. The ﬁrst pair of equations can be written as

CONCLUSION

A closed set of relativistic gyrokinetic equations, consisting of the collisionless gyrokinetic equation and the averaged
Maxwell’s equations, is derived for an arbitrary four-dimensional coordinate system.
In several respects the theory here developed represents a signiﬁcant improvement with respect to kinetic equations
derived by other authors. The present covariant kinetic theory adopts a set of hybrid gyrokinetic variables, two of which
include the Lorentz-invariant magnetic moment and gyrophase angle. The theory, allows E/B
O(1) and therefore
c) an moreover takes into account nonlinear effects of the EM wave-ﬁelds. Moreover,
permits relativistic drifts (Vd
since the gyrokinetic transformation is obtained to the second order in terms of the ratio of the Larmor radius to
the inhomogeneity scale, the theory can be applied also to the investigation of ﬁnite-Larmor radius effects. Another
interesting aspect is that in the present theory the wave ﬁeld is no longer limited in frequency and the wavelength, i.e.,
w /W
O(1), so that the class of admissible waves is broader than the usual “drift-Alfven perturbations”
and can include the magneto-sonic waves, for example.

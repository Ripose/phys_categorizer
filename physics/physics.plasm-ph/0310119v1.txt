Abstract

Two-surface wave decay (TSWD), i.e. the parametric excitation of electron surface waves, was

recently proposed as an absorption mechanism in the interaction of ultrashort, intense laser pulses

with solid targets. We present an extension of the ﬂuid theory of TSWD to a warm plasma which

treats boundary eﬀects consistently. We also present test-particle simulations showing localized

enhancement of electron acceleration by TSWD ﬁelds; this eﬀect leads to a modulation of the

current density entering into the target and may seed current ﬁlamentation instabilities.

INTRODUCTION

The excitation of electron surface waves (ESWs) is a possible route to collisionless energy

absorption in plasmas produced by the interaction of sub-picosecond, high intensity (typi-
1016 W/cm2) laser pulses with solid targets. This regime is relevant for applications

cally

such as generation of ultrashort X-ray pulses, either as uncoherent thermal emission ([1] and

references therein) or high laser harmonics [2], or production of energetic electrons and ions

≥

[1, 3, 4, 5].

Linear mode conversion of the laser wave into an ESW is not possible at a planar plasma-

vacuum interface, because the dispersion relation of ESWs does not allow phase matching

between the ESW and the incident wave; this process can take place for specially tailored

density proﬁles (e.g. grating or double-step targets). If the target density proﬁle is modu-

lated at the surface with a wavevector kp, the condition for the excitation of a ESW with

wavevector ks (parallel to the plasma surface) and the same frequency ωL of the laser pulse

is

kL sin θ = ks + kp,

(1)

where kL = ωL/c, θ is the angle of incidence of the laser pulse, and ks = ks(ωL) is given

by the ESW dispersion relation. Experimental investigations of laser absorption and X-ray

emission in grating targets are described, e.g., in Refs.[6, 7].

Nonlinear mode conversion, i.e. parametric excitation of two ESWs is possible also in

a simple “step” proﬁle. We name this process “two–surface wave decay” (TSWD) [8].

Examples of similar TSWD processes were previously considered in regimes other than

intense laser–plasma interactions and in the electrostatic limit only [9, 10]. The general

phase matching conditions for such three–wave process are given by

k0 = k+ + k− , ω0 = ω+ + ω−,

(2)

where k0, ω0 and k±, ω± are the wavevector and frequency of the “pump” wave and the two

ESWs, respectively. If the electric ﬁeld of the laser pulse acts as a “pump” for TSWD, then

ω0 = ωL, k0 = kL sin θ, and equation (2) implies that two sub–harmonic ESW are generated

with frequency around ω/2 (“ω

ω/2 + ω/2” TSWD). However, also the v

B term of

the Lorentz force may excite TSWD. This was observed in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations

[11] for normal laser incidence; in this case, the v

B force drives 1D oscillations at the

×

2

plasma surface with frequency 2ωL; after a few laser cycles the overlap of a standing wave

with frequency ωL was observed. This is a clear signature of a “2ω

ω + ω” process leading

→

to two counterpropagating ESWs both having the frequency of the laser pulse.

According to the theoretical model [8, 12], the maximum growth rate of the 2ω

ω + ω

case is found for normal incidence. As said above, TSWD does not need a structured

target; however, it is worth noticing that in a grating target the wavevector kp of the surface

modulation [eq.(1)] equals the wavevector of the two ESWs excited by the 2ω

process at θ = 0. Hence, the process is enhanced in such a grating target.

→

ω + ω

→
It is then

interesting to notice that PIC simulations reported in Ref.[7], showing the generation of two
countepropagating ESWs in grating targets at 1016 W/cm2, can now be interpreted as an

evidence of TSWD seeded by the surface grating.

At very high intensities (

1018 W/cm2), simulations [11] show that TSWD enters a

≥

strongly nonlinear regime leading to strong rippling of the plasma surface. This might be

relevant to the surface instabilities which have been observed in experiments [13] and play a

detrimental role in high harmonic generation from solid targets [14, 15, 16]; such instabilities

appear to grow even for pulses of few tens of fs [16] and thus must be of electronic nature,

since ions do not move on such a fast scale. Simulations also show that nonlinear TSWD

aﬀects fast electron generation. This eﬀect is investigated in section III by means of test-

particle simulations. Before that, in section II we present an improvement of the model of

Ref.[8] where temperature eﬀects have been included. In both cases, we restrict ourselves to

the case of the 2ω

ω + ω TSWD at normal laser incidence.

II. TEMPERATURE AND BOUNDARY EFFECTS ON TSWD

In Ref.[8] the TSWD growth rate was calculated for a step-like density proﬁle [ni =

n0Θ(x), being Θ(x) the Heaviside step function] using an Eulerian, ﬂuid model with immobile

ions and using the cold plasma approximation. We adopted the following expansion for all

ﬁelds

f (x, y, t) = fi(x, t

y sin θ/c) + ǫf0(x)eiω0(t−y sin θ/c) +

−

ǫ2[f+(x)eik+y−iω+t + f−(x)eik−y−iω−t],

(3)

where ǫ is a small expansion parameter, and f stands for either the electron density or

velocity or for the EM ﬁelds in the (x, y) plane. The ﬁrst term (fi) of eq.(3) includes zero-

order, unperturbed ﬁelds or oscillating ﬁelds that are non-resonant with the excited modes;

the term f0 represents the “pump” ﬁeld at the frequency ω0; the last term is the sum of

two counterpropagating surface modes. For the 2ω

ω + ω process at θ = 0, ω0 = 2ωL

and k+ =

k−, and the zero– and ﬁrst–order ﬁelds do not depend on y (i.e. they are “1D”

ﬁelds). The coupling between the pump and the surface modes (of order ǫ3) originates from

the nonlinear terms in the Euler equation (

The calculation for a warm, isothermal plasma proceeds very similarly [17] and thus

only the diﬀerences from the “cold” case and their consequences are discussed below, while

details of the calculation will be published elsewhere. The only diﬀerence in the starting

Maxwell-Euler systems of equations comes from the pressure term in the Euler equation for

e(ni −
At Te = 0 this corresponds to a surface charge layer [i.e. ρ

δ(x), where δ(x) is the Dirac

∼

delta function], while the longitudinal velocity (vx) is discontinous at the surface. This is

relevant because in the Te = 0 case nonlinear coupling terms involving the product of ﬁelds

that are singular at x = 0 occur. The pressure term removes such singularities and enables

to evaluate all such terms correctly. Therefore, calculating the TSWD growth rate and later

taking the limit of zero temperature results in an improvement of the result obtained in the

cold plasma case.

The ﬁnal result of the calculation is the 2ω

ω + ω growth rate shown in Fig.1 (the

→

complete analytical expression is very lengthy [17] and is not reported here). With respect

to the Te = 0 case, the two resonances at ω = ωp/√2 and ω = ωp/2 (the latter due to the

well-known resonant behavior of the v

B “pump” oscillation) are quenched for growing

temperatures. This eﬀect is particularly strong for the ω

ωp/√2 resonance since in this

→

limit the ESWs have shorter wavelengths, and are thus more aﬀected by the thermal pressure

that inhibits the formation of small-scale structures.

III. ELECTRON ACCELERATION

At high intensity of the laser pulse, it is well known that most of the absorbed energy goes

into “fast” electrons injected into the overdense plasma region. At normal incidence, due

to the leading action of the v

B force, fast electron bunches are produced twice per laser

×

cycle. The PIC simulations of Ref.[11] showed that after the growth of nonlinear TSWD

the generation of fast electrons was enhanced near spatial maxima of the standing surface

oscillation (Fig.2, top). Thus, this eﬀect may give an “imprint” for the formation of electron

ﬁlaments, whose size and spacing would be close to (and scaling with) the laser wavelength

as observed in other simulations [18, 19], and aﬀect energy transport by fast electrons into

the plasma.

To investigate this eﬀect further, we performed “test particle” simulations of electron

motion in the overlapping “pump” and TSWD ﬁelds. In other words, we solve the equation

of motion for electrons into a force ﬁeld of the form given by eq.(3), i.e. the sum of an

one-dimensional (1D) force of frequency 2ω (whose analytical expression is obtained from

the theoretical model) and the force ﬁeld from a standing 2D surface wave of frequency

ω. A similar study, focused on the acceleration of electrons by a single ESW, was recently

reported [20].

The 1D and 2D ﬁelds vary in time as cos 2ωt and sin ωt, so that the temporal maxima

and minima of the ESW ﬁeld are always coincident in time with maxima of the 1D ﬁeld,

as it was found in theory and simulation [8, 11]. In what follows, x is the direction normal

to the plasma surface located at x = 0 (the plasma occupies the x > 0 region) and y is the

direction of propagation of ESW. The ﬁeld amplitudes are chosen so that the system remains

far from relativistic conditions and the ESW ﬁeld can be considered as a perturbation. The

ratio between the amplitudes of standing SW and the 2ω pump was varied as a parameter.

For the simulations reported in this paper, in terms of normalized amplitudes, a = eE/mecω

where E is the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld, the values are aL = 0.2 for the laser ﬁeld and

aESW = 0.019 for the ESW ﬁeld. The wavevectors of the laser wave and of the ESW are
p/ω2 = 5. To
given by the known expressions for a cold plasma with density ne/nc = ω2
initialize the simulations, we gave the particles an initial position x(0) > 0 such that the

evanescent ﬁelds are negligible at that point, and an initial velocity vx(0) < 0 (on average

vx =

−

0.1c) so that the particles move towards the surface region, where the ESW ﬁelds are

5

localized. The particles are distributed in y uniformly over a region of width λs, where λs

is the ESW wavelength.

The (y, px) projection of the test particle phase space (Fig.2, bottom) looks similar to

the one from the fully self-consistent PIC simulation (Fig.2, top), showing that electron

acceleration is indeed enhanced near spatial maxima of the standing wave. The overlap of

the SW ﬁelds with the v

B-driven ﬁelds (homogeneous along the y-direction) thus leads

×
to a modulation along y of the longitudinal momenta.

The enhancement (or quenching) of the accelerating ﬁeld occurs once per laser cycle

(because the ESW frequency equals the laser frequency), but with opposite phase between

contiguous maxima of the standing ESW. This is shown by Fig.3 where the complete (x, px)

phase space projection, showing electron bunches generated at 2ω rate, is compared with the

same plot but including now only the electrons whose starting position lies within an interval

of λ/4 width around the y = λ/4 spatial maximum of the ESW. It is thus evident how the

most energetic electrons in the bunches penetrating in the x > 0 region are generated near

the ESW maximum and at ω rate, i.e. with the ESW frequency. Taking only the electrons

around the y = 3λ/4 spatial maximum gives an almost identical picture, except that the

most energetic bunches are now out of phase by an angle of 2π/ω with respect to those

coming from y = λ/4.

Although the amplitude of ESW ﬁelds is 0.1 times the pump ﬁeld amplitude, the relative

modulation of the longitudinal momentum px is about 30%. This can be qualitatively

explained at follows. The electrons acquire energy from an evanescent, oscillating ﬁeld if

their transit time across the region where the ﬁeld has non-vanishing amplitude is shorter

than an oscillation period; this is the condition for non-adiabaticity of electron motion

with respect to the ﬁeld. The ratio between the transit time and the oscillation period is

approximately given by the parameter η = L/v0T where L is the evanescence length, v0 is

and lESW = (c/ω)√α

the average velocity of the electron and T is the oscillation period. For the ESW, T = 2π/ω

that the electron motion (for a given v0) is more non-adiabatic with respect to the ESW

ﬁeld rather than to the 2ω oscillation. Thus, the contribution of the ESW in accelerating

(or decelerating) electrons is enhanced by the relatively low frequency and short evanescence

length.

The “imprint” eﬀect of the standing ESW is also noticeable in the contourplot of the ﬂuid

velocity of electrons, shown in Fig.4. The velocity ﬁeld has been computed by averaging the

velocity over a spatial grid, as in PIC codes, and over time. As a consequence the electric

current in the overdense plasma region has a spatial transverse modulation with the same

wavelength of ESWs. The simulations of Ref.[7] for “grating” targets also show a modulation

of the fast electron current correlated with same period of the grating, that may be due to

the local enhancement of the longitudinal ﬁeld by TSWD or to the geometrical “funnel”

eﬀect of the surface deformation [21].

From ﬁgures 2 and 3 it is also found that only near ESW spatial maxima a few electrons

are ejected into vacuum, i.e. in the x < 0 region (in Fig.3, for these electrons the oscillation

of px vs. x is due to the eﬀect of the v

B force in vacuum). Their origin is likely to

×

be due to the longitudinal ﬁeld component directed into vacuum that is associated to the

ESWs. In Ref.[20], the features of electrons accelerated in vacuum by the ﬁeld of a single

ESW are investigated. Note, however, that electrostatic back-holding ﬁelds are not self-

consistently included in test particle simulations and thus the number of electrons escaping

in vacuum is likely to be overestimated. Nevertheless, it is interesting to notice that in the

PIC simulations at very high intensities [11, 12] “plumes” of electrons extending into the

vacuum region are generated near the maxima of the standing ESW. A “plume” structure

in the vacuum region is also evident in the velocity ﬁeld shown in Fig.4.

Mode Number in Low Magnetic Fields

Abstract. Radio-frequency discharges are performed in low magnetic ﬁelds (0-10
mT) using three types of helicon-wave exciting antennas with the azimuthal mode
number of |m| = 1. The most pronounced peak of plasma density is generated in
the case of phased helical antenna at only a few mT, where the helicon wave with
|m| = 1 is purely excited and propagates. An analysis based on the dispersion relation
well explains the density-peak phenomenon in terms of the correspondence between
the antenna one-wavelength and the helicon wavelength. The m = +1 helicon wave
propagates even in high magnetic ﬁelds where the density peaks are not observed, but
the m = −1 helicon wave disappers. It is expected theoretically that the m = −1
helicon wave shows cutoﬀ behavior in a low density region, and the cutoﬀ of m = −1
helicon wave experimentally observed coincides with the calculated one.

1. Introduction

The helicon-wave discharge has been extensively investigated because a high electron
density (1012 − 1013 cm−3) is obtained with comparatively ease under a low gas pressure
of a few hundreds mPa [1,2], being used as plasma source for applications to material
processings [3,4], such as etching, plasma chemical vapor deposition, etc. Conventional
helicon-wave discharges need strong magnetic ﬁelds (B0 ≫ 10 mT) generated by elec-
tromagnets with a measurable amount of power, which has commercially a disadvantage
for operating helicon-wave plasma sources with the lower running cost. For the purpose
of expanding application ﬁelds of the helicon-wave source, it is signiﬁcant to make the
best of an eﬃcient plasma production in a very low magnetic ﬁeld. In several previ-
ous works concerning the mechanism of the plasma production with anomalously high
density [5-7], on the other hand, a density increment enhanced by the helicon waves
is observed under a weak magnetic ﬁeld much smaller than the magnetic ﬁelds that a
mode transition from an inductive-coupled discharge to the helicon-wave discharge ap-
pears. However, the reason why the helicon waves can be excited within narrow range
of low magnetic ﬁelds has not been exhibited at all. Chen [8] has recently suggested
using a numerical code that the density peak observed in low magnetic ﬁelds is caused
by an increase in the plasma loading, which is due to the reﬂection of electromagnetic

waves at an endplate near the antenna. This eﬀect is noticeable only in the case of a
loop antenna with the azimuthal mode number m = 0, while the density peak is also
observed in other experiments using the |m| = 1 antennas. Therefore it is required to
systematically investigate the density peak mechanism, which leads to the development
of the eﬃcient plasma source in low magnetic ﬁelds.

On the basis of the background mentioned above, we investigate the m = +1 and
m = −1 helicon wave discharges with low density and low magnetic ﬁelds by using
three types of |m| = 1 rf antennas, a phased multiple helical-antenna (PMH), a half-
wavelength helical antenna (HH) [9], and a double half-turn antenna (DHT) [5]. Since
PMH is possible to excite spatiotemporally-rotating electromagnetic ﬁelds with ﬁxing
the wave numbers parallel and perpendicular to magnetic ﬁeld lines in a plasma, the
helicon-wave behavior can be clariﬁed even in the magnetic ﬁeld lower than the thresh-
old ﬁeld, above which the conventional helicon wave is excited.

2. Experimental Setup

The experiment apparatus is shown in Fig. 1, which consists of an antenna section of
a Pyrex tube (10 cm in diameter and 40 cm in length) and a measurement section of a
stainless chamber (26 cm in diameter and 89 cm in length). An endplate is set at z = 59
cm from the entrance of the measurement section. In order to excite selectively m = +1
and m = −1 helicon waves, the phased multiple helical antenna (PMH) is used in this
experiment. PMH consists of four elements, each of which is twisted into helix in the
left-hand direction along the +z axis with the antenna length of lz = 20 cm. An rf signal
from a signal generator is divided into two, the phase diﬀerence of them is ﬁxed at 90◦ by
a phase shifter. The rf signals driven with 90◦ phase diﬀerence are ampliﬁed and supplied
to two pairs of the antenna elements through the impedance matching circuits, each of
which is divided into two branches and transmitted to the opposite terminals of the two
elements spaced azimuthally 180◦. Accordingly, the spatiotemporally-rotating (circular-
polarized) rf ﬁelds with |m| = 1 are generated by PMH. The temporal rotation is ﬁxed
in the right-hand direction with respect to the +z direction. The uniform magnetic
ﬁeld less than 11 mT is produced along the z axis by solenoidal coils. The temporal
rotation is ﬁxed in the right-hand direction with respect to the +z direction, and the
change from m = +1 to m = −1 is attained by reversing the magnetic ﬁeld direction
from B0 > 0 to B0 < 0. In addition to PMH, HH (lz = 20 cm) and DHT are also used
as the conventional helicon-wave antennas with |m| = 1, each of which is supplied with
the rf power using only one transmission line. Typical operating parameters include the
rf frequency of ω/2π = 13.56 MHz, the rf power of Prf = 1000 W, and ﬁlling argon
pressure of 5 × 10−2 Pa. Plasma parameters and magnetic ﬂuctuations are measured by
an axially movable (z-axis) Langmuir-probe and a magnetic probe, respectively.

3. Results

Figures 2(a), (b), and (c) give the electron densities depending on the magnetic ﬁeld for
the several rf powers using PMH, HH, and DHT, respectively. In the case of PMH, the
electron density increases with increasing in B0 for m = +1, and the density has a peak
at B0 ∼ +5 mT for 2000 W, where the density attains up to one order of magnitude
larger than that at B0 = 0 mT, i.e., ICP mode. The peak density becomes higher with
increasing in Prf , and B0 yielding the density peak is diﬀerent between each rf power.
On the other hand, the density scarcely increases for m = −1, and the peak density is
almost one-ﬁfth the magnitude of that for m = +1. The density diﬀerence for between
m = +1 and m = −1 becomes small in the case of HH (Fig. 2(b)), and is not observed in
the case of DHT as shown in Fig. 2(c). The reason for the density increment for B0 < 0
is that DHT concurrently excites m = ±1 ﬁelds, and m = +1 ﬁeld excited regardless of
magnetic-ﬁeld direction gives rise to the density increment. Since HH includes double
half-turn parts at the both ends and excites m = ±1 ﬁelds, the density increment is
caused in B0 < 0 (Fig. 2(b)), which is larger than that in the case of PMH.

When the z component of the magnetic ﬂuctuation Bz is measured in z > 0 cm,
waves with large amplitude are observed to propagate toward the downstream. The
radial amplitude proﬁles of them for B0 = +3, −3, +10, and −10 mT are plotted in
Figs. 3(a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. The solid lines of each ﬁgure show the ﬁtted
curves expressed by composite function of the zeroth and ﬁrst order Bessel functions
(J0 and J1). In the case of |B0| = 3 mT, Bz is formed with J1 approximately for both of
m = +1 and m = −1 modes and the radial position where the amplitude goes to zero is
r = 5.5 cm obtained from ﬁtted curves, which agrees with the plasma radius determined
by the Pyrex tube size. The diﬀerence in magnitude between the right and left peaks
shows that the wave includes J0 component about 10 %, the boundary of which exists
at r = 13 cm, namely, the stailess chamber wall. The generation mechanism of J0
component is not cleared for the moment. The amplitude for B0 = +10 mT (Fig. 3(b))
is also ﬁtted to J1 Bessel function approximately. The Bz radial proﬁle doesn’t depend
on B0 for m = +1, but it is found that the amplitude for B0 = −10 mT is not ﬁtted
to J1 but J0 in spite of m = −1 excitation, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The radial position
where the amplitude goes to zero is r = 13 cm as well as J0 components included slightly
in |m| = 1 helicon waves. But the amplitude of the m = 0 wave for B0 = −10 mT is
greater than that of J0 components for other cases of Figs. 3(a), (b), and (c).

The theoretical dispersion relation of the waves is expressed for a cold uniform

plasma:

P n4

z + (n2

⊥(S + P ) − 2P S)n2

z + (Sn2

⊥ − RL)(n2

⊥ − P ) = 0,

(1)

where P , S, R, and L are followed by Stix notation [10]. nz and n⊥ are the refraction
indexes parallel and perpendicular to B0, respectively. The perpendicular wave number
k⊥ is 58 m−1 calculated from Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). Figure 4 shows the dispersion relations
of the m = +1 helicon wave (kz vs B0), where closed circles are measured by a b-dot
probe and solid line is calculated from ne depending on B0 for PMH at Prf = 1000 W

(Fig. 2(a)). The measured dispersion relation is consistent with the theoretical curve of
the helicon wave in the range of B0 > 2 mT, while that diﬀers B0 < 2 mT. Open circles
indicate the maximum amplitude of Bz depending on B0, which is extremely small in
B0 < 2 mT. Hence, the discrepancy of the dispersion relation in B0 < 2 mT is caused by
the inﬂuence of antenna near-ﬁelds rather than the helicon wave with strong damping.
When the electron density and the magnetic ﬁeld are given, the wavelength allowed
to exist in the plasma can be calculated from the dispersion relation. Thus, the
relationships between the electron density ne and the axial wavelength λz for PRF = 1000
W are presented in Fig. 5, where λz is calculated from Fig. 2 and Eq. (1) with λ⊥
ﬁxed by the radial boundary as mentioned above. The electron density becomes high
at a speciﬁc wavelength, i.e., λz = 20 cm (40 cm) for PMH (HH). Those wavelengths
correspond with one axial wavelengths of PMH (lz) and HH (2lz), respctively. Therefore
the helicon wave is excited strongly in the plasma with the wavelength λz determined
by the electron density and the magnetic ﬁeld, which becomes comparable to the one
wavelength of the antenna. As shown in Fig. 5, on the other hand, we can recognize no
clear-cut relationship between λz and ne for the DHT case, since the electromagnetic
ﬁeld with the ﬁxed wave number of the z component is hardly excited by DHT. Instead
the density is observed to slightly increase around λz = 59 cm corresponding with the
axial boundary length, which is considered due to exciting the standing-wave [11].

In the previous works, the characteristics of

|m| = 1 helicon wave in an
inhomogeneous plasma have been investigated theoretically and experimentally [12,13].
Kr¨amer suggested that the m = −1 helicon wave in an inhomogeneous plasma is damped
more strongly than that in a homogeneous plasma, and which has a cutoﬀ in a low
0 exp(−(r/d)2), the
density region [13]. Considering Gaussian density proﬁles ne = nd

where d is the proﬁle width yeilding the density of 1/e and kz is the wave number parallel
to B0, and α = k2
pe/ωωce with k0 = ω/c. g(r) > 0 is required in the case where the
helicon wave exists in an inhomogeneous plasma. For the m = +1 and m = 0 modes,
g(r) is always positive and the wave can propagate in nonuniform plasmas. However,
the m = −1 helicon wave can only propagate in the higher density region above a crit-
ical density. The critical density curve is theoretically described on the B0 − ne plane
using Eq.(2), as shown in Fig. 6, where d is obtained from the radial density proﬁle
measured by the Langmuir probe. kz is calculated by using Eq.(1) and the perpendic-
ular wavenumber is k⊥ = 69 m−1 obtained from Fig. 3(c). g(r) is constantly positive
(negative) in the gray (white) zone, which is called propagation (cutoﬀ) region. Dots in
Fig. 6 indicate the electron densities measured, which belong to the propagation region
only when 1 ≤ B0 ≤ 5 mT. It can be said that the m = 0 helicon wave exists when the
background plasma density gets into the cutoﬀ region of B0 > 5 mT.

4. Conclucion

In summary, we have clariﬁed a new class of practical aspect of the helicon-wave dis-
charge employing various |m| = 1 antennas in magnetic ﬁelds much lower than the
ordinary magnetic ﬁeld where the density jump occurs. It is found that the eﬀective
excitation of the helicon wave and the eﬃcient plasma production causally take place
even in the very weak magnetic ﬁeld when the axial wavelength of the phased helical
antenna launching spatiotemporally-rotating electromagnetic ﬁelds is matched to that
of the helicon wave determined by the plasma dispersion relation. The m = +1 helicon
wave propagates in the plasma independent of the magnetic ﬁeld strength. On the other
hand, the m = −1 helicon wave propagates only in very low magnetic ﬁelds where den-
sity peaks are observed. The cutoﬀ of m = −1 helicon wave is theoretically concluded
to exist in the region of B0 > 5 mT, where the helicon wave propagates with m = 0.

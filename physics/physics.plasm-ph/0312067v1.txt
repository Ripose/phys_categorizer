CHARGE FLUCTUATION OF DUST GRAINS AND ITS IMPACT ON
DUSTY WAVE.PROPAGATION

In this paper we consider the inﬂuence of dust charge ﬂuctuations on damping of
the dust-ion-acoustic waves. Fluid approximation of longitudinal electrostatic waves
in unmagnetized plasmas is considered. We show that for a weak acoustic wave the
attenuation depends on a phenomenological charging coeﬃcient.

Introduction

Plasmas with dust grains are of interest both for the cosmic space as well as
for the laboratory plasmas. Examples include cometary environments, planetary
rings, the interstellar medium, the Earth’s and other planets magnetospheres [1].
Dust has been found to be a determinant component of rareﬁed plasmas used
in the microelectronic processing industry [2], and it may also be present in the
limiter regions of fusion plasmas due to sputtering of the carbon by energetic
It is interesting to note the recent ﬂurry of activity in the dusty
particles.
plasma research. It has been driven largely by discoveries of the role of dust in
quite diﬀerent settings: the ring of Saturn [1] and the plasma processing device
[2]. Dusty plasmas contain, beside positive ions and electrons, large particles
usually negatively charged. They are conglomerations of the ions, electrons
and neutral particles. These large particles, to be called grains, have atomic
numbers Zd in the range of 104 − 106 and their mass md can be equal to 106 of
the proton mass or even much more. In the considered dusty plasmas, the size
of grains is small compared with average distance between the grains.The ratio
of charge to mass for a given component of plasma determines its dynamics.
We note that for dusty plasmas, ratio of electrical charges of grains to their
masses is usually much smaller than in the case of multispecies plasmas with
negative ions and hence, here comes the ﬁrst of the crucial diﬀerences between
multispecies plasmas with negative ions and dusty plasmas. Because dynamics
of the dusty plasma components, electrons, positive ions and dust grains is quite
diﬀerent in the time and length scales considered here, then the equations for
these components of the dusty plasma may be diﬀerent. If it is assumed that
all grains have equal masses and charges steady in time, therefore the dust-ion-
acoustic and dust-acoustic dispersion relations are obtained on the basis of ﬂuid
[3], [4] or kinetic [5] models. In this case we have assumed, for simplicity, that
all grains have equal masses and charges, but charges are not constant in time
- they may ﬂuctuate in time. The dust charges are not really independent of
the variations in the plasma potentials. Here, even in the ﬂuid theory, appear
the crucial diﬀerences between the ordinary multispecies plasmas and the dusty
plasmas. All modes will inﬂuence the charging mechanism, and feedback will
lead to several new interesting and unexpected phenomena. The charging of
the grains depends on local plasma characteristics. If the waves disturb these
characteristic, then charging of the grains is aﬀected and the grain charge is
modiﬁed, with a resulting feedback on the wave mode.

The simplest cases to deal with are the parallel electrostatic modes in an
unmagnetized plasma. Then the electric ﬁeld E is one-dimensional and may be
represented by the electric potential φ: E = −∂φ/∂x. We consider a problem
when the temperature of electrons Te is much greater than the temperature
of ions Ti: Te ≫ Ti. In such simpliﬁed situations, ﬂuctuations in time of the
number density of electrons δne can occur due to the grains of the dust loosing
or picking up some electrons. Dust charge ﬂuctuations in time give rise to
purely damped acoustic modes when the streams of particles are absent. Here
we solve the continuity equations in approximation for the source term vanishing
at equilibrium.

1 Fluctuation of dust grains in dusty plasmas

As a result of ﬂuctuating dust charges in dusty plasmas, many new prob-
lems can appear which are in partly treatment by Verheest [6]. We consider
a speciﬁc problem when the temperature of electrons is much greater than the
temperature of ions and we also assume that the mass of grains with ﬂuctuating
charges may be approximated by constant values. In this case the continuity
equations for specimens of dusty plasmas can be written in the form:

∂nd/∂t + ∂(ndud)/∂x = 0,

∂ni/∂t + ∂(niui)/∂x = 0,

∂ne/∂t + ∂(neue)/∂x = Se.

(2.1)

(2.3)

Due to the possible ﬂuctuations of the dust charges we can express the

conservation of charge in the dusty plasma by:

∂
∂t

∂
∂x

(−nee + ndqd + nie) +

(−neeue + ndqdud + nieui) = 0,

(2.2)

where qd is the charge of grain of dust. This can be rewritten with the help of
the continuity equation (2.1 - 2.3) as:

nd

+ ud

qd = e Se.

On the other hand, the charge of grain of dust ﬂuctuation is given by:

dqd

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

+ ud

qd = Ii (ni,qd) + Ie (ne, qd) ,

(2.4)

where Ii (ni, qd) and Ie (ne, qd) are the ionic and electronic charging current,
respectively. When we combine (2. 3) and (2.4), we get

eSe = ndIe (ne, qd) + ndIi (ni,qd) .

(2.5)

In equilibrium dusty plasma, the total charging current vanishes:

Ii0 + Ie0 = 0,

(2.6)

where Ii0 and Ie0 denotes the equilibrium charging current for ions and electrons,
respectively. Therefore we can expand (2.5) as a function of ne, qd and nd using
(2.6) and hence in linear approximation for Se vanishing at equilibrium, it is
given by:

Se = −νeδne − µeδqd,
where νe, µe denotes charging ﬂuctuation coeﬃcients while δne and δqd denotes
ﬂuctuation electron number density and ﬂuctuation charges of grains from their
equilibrium values respectively.

3 Conclusions

The paper deals with a small dust charge ﬂuctuations. In the case considered
here , when the temperature of electrons is much greater than the temperature
of the ions: Te >> Ti and Te is not great enough for further ionization of
the ions, we show that attenuation of the acoustic wave depends only on one
phenomenological coeﬃcient νe. The value of this coeﬃcient depends mainly on
the temperature of electrons.

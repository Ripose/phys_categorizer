Abstract

Theoretical electron density-sensitive line ratios R1 − R6 of Ar XIV soft X-ray

emission lines are presented. We found that these line ratios are sensitive to electron

density ne, and the ratio R1 is insensitive to electron temperature Te. Recent work

has shown that accurate atomic data, such as electron impact excitation rates, is

very important for reliable determination of the electron density of laboratory and

astrophysical plasmas. Present work indicates that the maximum discrepancy of

line ratios introduced from diﬀerent atomic data calculated with distorted wave

and R-matrix approximations, is up to 18% in the range of ne = 109−13cm−3. By

comparison of these line ratios with experiment results carried out in electron beam

ion trap (EBIT-II), electron density of the laboratory plasma is diagnosed, and a

consistent result is obtained from R1, R2 and R3. Our result is in agreement with

that diagnosed by Chen et al.using triplet of N VI. A relative higher diagnosed

electron density from R2 is due to its weak sensitivity to electron temperature. A

better consistency at lower Te indicates that temperature of the laboratory plasma is

lower than logTe(K)=6.5. Comparison between the measured and theoretical ratios

1 Introduction

Spectroscopy has exhibited its great importance for diagnostic of laboratory

and astrophysical plasmas. Emission lines arising from n = 2 → n = 2 transi-

tions of B-, C- and N-like ions have been frequently observed in solar extreme-

ultraviolet spectra [1]. They have been extensively used to determine electron

temperature and/or density of stellar coronae through line intensity ratios.

Keenan et al.[2-4] presented electron density-sensitive ratios for B-like ions

including Si X, Ar XIV and Ca XVI etc. For C-like ions including S XI, Ca

XV, Fe XXI and Ar XIII, the electron density-sensitive ratios were also given

by Keenan et al.[5-8]. For N-like ions, to our best knowledge, the electron

density-sensitive ratios were presented only for S X [9]. Using the ratios from

these ions’ lines, accurate electron densities have been obtained, which are

consistent with those from iron ions with same temperatures of maximum frac-

tional abundance in ionization equilibrium [10]. Another beneﬁt using these

line ratios is that the uncertainty due to ionization equilibrium and element

abundance has been eliminated.

With the launch of a new generation of X-ray satellites, including Chandra and

XMM, a large amount of high quality spectra with high spectral resolution

and high eﬀective area have been obtained for nearly all classes of astrophys-

ical X-ray sources [11-17]. This will allow us to estimate physical parameters

such as the electron temperature and density of the stellar X-ray corona. The

temperature has long been available before the launch of the two satellites,

while the density determination of X-ray emitting layer becomes possible until

the launch of satellites with the high-spectral resolution. Spatial information

of stars could be assessed indirectly from relationship between electron density

and emission measure (EM = n2

eV ). For reliable determination of the electron

density and temperature, accurate atomic data is very important, especially

electron impact excitation rates and oscillator strengths [8].

Currently, the electron density is mainly determined using triplet line ratios

(resonance, inter-combination and forbidden lines) of He-like ions for line for-

mation regions. Ness et al.[18] and Testa et al.[19] present an extensive investi-

gation using those He-like ions for stars with diﬀerent activity levels, and dis-

close that the electron density of stellar coronae does not exceed 5 ×1012cm−3.

One reason of the extensive application of He-like ions is that a larger amount

of reliable atomic data is available, because the atomic data calculation of

K-shell ions is relatively simple. And some laboratory experiments conducted

in Tokamak, electron beam ion traps (EBIT) and intense laser-matter inter-

action have been carried to benchmark the theoretical calculation for K-shell

ions [20,21]. Many L-shell emission lines of iron ions have been detected for

star coronae. The temperature structure of the X-ray emitting layers have

been obtained using these iron lines. However, further investigation is still

necessary to depict out the structure of the stellar coronae and to explain

heating mechanism.

In X-ray spectra of stars with various activity, the L-shell emission lines of non-

3

iron elements including Si, S, Ar and Ca have also been detected. But recent

studies revealed that there are large uncertainties for the atomic data of these

ions. Fortunately, a large project—Emission Line Project supported by the

Chandra X-ray Observatory, has been opened to complete a comprehensive

catalog of astrophysically relevant emission lines in support of new-generation

X-ray observatories. Lepson et al. [22] recently made an experiment for highly

charged Ar ions in EBIT-II to benchmark theoretical calculation. The intensity

ratios of the L-shell emission lines of these non-iron ions might be used for

direct density estimations of stellar coronae and fusion plasma. Therefore the

exploration and calibration of the line intensity ratios of the L-shell emission

lines of the non-iron elements, such as Si, S, Ar and Ca, are necessary in the

next few years.

Argon is an abundant element, and has been detected in solar and solar-

like stars, such as Capella [13], Algol [23] and AU Mic [24]. For example, the

emission lines arising from n = 3−2 transitions of Ar XVI have been identiﬁed

by Audard et al. [13], and 3d − 2p transition lines located near 27.043 ˚A

of Ar XV have also been identiﬁed in our previous work [25]. In ionization

equilibrium condition [10], the temperature of maximum Ar XIV fractional

abundance has a same value with that of He-like Ne. However the triplets of

He-like Ne are strongly blended by forest-like features of highly charged Fe

ions [26]. So the features of Ar XIV may give the density information in Ne

IX ion formation region. At present, APEC database is the most complete

and has been extensively used in X-ray spectral analyses for stars. In fact

APEC extends Chianti database by including some experimental values of

highly charged iron ions. In Chianti database, emission lines of Ar XIV are also

included. However all the collision rates are results withs distorted wave (DW)

4

approximation and using less conﬁgurations. Therefore the exploration of the

density-sensitive line ratios of highly charged Ar XIV using more accurate

atomic data will be meaningful.

In this paper we present calculations of electron density-sensitive line inten-

sity ratios of Ar XIV in X-ray line formation region. Present calculation of

atomic structure includes more conﬁgurations than previous work, and some

excitation rates are replaced by data from R-matrix method. By comparing

these ratios with experimental ones conducted by Lepson et al. [22] in the

Lawrence Livermore electron beam ion traps EBIT-II, the electron density of

the laboratory plasma is determined.

2 Theoretical line ratios

The model ion for Ar XIV consists of 152 ﬁne-structure energy levels belong-

ing to the conﬁgurations 2s22p, 2s2p2, 2p3, 2s23l, 2s2p3l, 2p23l(l = s, p, d),

2s2nl (n = 4, 5, 6 andl = n − 1).

Electron impact excitation rates are obtained by performing numerical in-

tegration of collision strengths over a Maxwellian distribution. The collision

strengths among the lowest 152 energy levels, along with the spontaneous ra-

diative decay rates and energy levels were calculated using the Flexible Atomic

Code (FAC) developed by Gu [27,28]. The atomic structure calculation in

FAC is based on the fully relativistic conﬁguration interaction approximation,

while the electron impact collision strengths are calculated in the relativis-

tic DW approximation. These data are available electronically from the au-

thors (gyliang@bao.ac.cn) on request. For the electron impact excitation rates

5

among the lowest 15 levels, we adopted recent results of Keenan et al. [8], in

which a more accurate method— R-matrix (Burke and Roob [29]) is adopted.

As noted by, for example, Seaton [30], excitation by protons will be important

for the lowest levels. This will aﬀect the X-ray emission lines indirectly. In the

present analysis we have employed the rates of Foster, Keenan & Reid [31],

which were calculated using a close-coupled impact-parameter method.

Using the atomic data discussed above in conjunction with rate equations,

relative Ar XIV level populations were derived for a range of electron temper-

atures and densities. The rate equations are given as [25,32,33]

where the superscript e and d refer to electron excitation and deexcitation,

Nj is the number density of level j, and ne is the electron density. In the

calculations, following assumptions were made: (i) photon-excitation and de-

excitation rates are negligible in comparison with the corresponding collision

rates; (ii) ionization to and recombination from other ionic levels are slow

compared with bound-bound rates; (iii) the plasma is optically thin. Generally,

the line intensity for a given transition line λji is given by

Iji = NjAji.

In order to correctly understand the astrophysical spectra, Lepson et al. [22]

carried out an experiment in Lawrence Livermore electron beam ion traps

EBIT-II for Ar at three diﬀerent energies of 600, 650 and 1000 eV. This is

part of a large project to complete a comprehensive catalog of astrophysically

relevant emission lines in support of new-generation X-ray observatories. In

this experiment, several emission lines of Ar XIV were detected, as shown in

R5 = I(27.631 ˚A)/I(31.360 ˚A),
R6 = I(27.631 ˚A)/I(32.014 ˚A).

Therefore they may be useful for the electron density diagnostics for all kinds

of hot plasma with suﬃcient signal-to-noise ratio. Figures 1—4 show the theo-

retical line intensity ratios as a function of the electron density at temperature

(logTe(K)=6.5) of maximum Ar XIV fractional abundance in ionization equi-

librium [10]. Predictions of ratios R3 and R5 are much larger than one, so

the determination of electron density will be very diﬃcult due to extremely

faint lines involved.

FAC prediction in density-sensitive region as shown in Fig. 1. For clarity, Chi-

anti prediction is shown only for ratio R1. APEC shows similar result with

Chianti prediction due to same data adopted for Ar XIV. An inspection of the

ﬁgures also tells us that the ratios are sensitive to the electron density. For

example R1 and R2, vary by factors of 4.4 and 4.3 respectively, at ne = 109

and 1012 cm−3. Moreover the ratio R1 is insensitive to electron temperature.

For example, a change in Te of 0.2 dex (i.e. 58%) leads to a less than 1%

variation at ne = 109 cm−3, up to 3% at ne = 1011 cm−3, as show in Fig.

5. The sensitivity of the line intensity ratio R1 to electron density, combined

with its insensitivity to Te, makes it very useful for the density diagnostics for

laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.

electron density (ne in cm−3) at temperature logTe(K)=6.3 (dotted line), 6.5 (solid

line) and 6.7 (dashed line)

experiment, energy of electron beam is ﬁxed at 1.0 KeV. However, the energy

will become lower than 1.0 KeV when the electrons interact with cold Ar gas

in trap region. The temperature of produced Ar plasma is not given by Lepson

et al.[22]. For detailed information of the experiment, you can refer the paper

written by Lepson et al. [22]. Recently, Chen et al. [34] measured the electron

density (6.0 × 1010cm−3) of the laboratory plasma using triplet line intensity

ratio of He-like N ion.

In Table 1, we present the measured intensities relative to that of the line at

27.469 ˚A , along with the theoretical results including the HULLAC [22] and

FAC calculations by us. In the theoretical calculation, the electron tempera-

ture adopted here is logTe(K)=6.5 which corresponds to maximum Ar XIV

fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium [10], while the electron density

is ne = 5.6 × 1010cm−3. In the ionization equilibrium condition, the fraction of

Ar XIV as a function of temperature has a steep peak at logTe(K)=6.5. Since

emissivity almost comes from plasma with this temperature, we assume the

produced plasma is isothermal plasma with temperature logTe(K)=6.5. Table

11

1 shows that our results are in agreement with experimental measurements

and are better than the HULLAC calculation in wavelength. For the relative

intensities, our calculation also agree with experimental measurement except

for the line at 30.344 ˚A .

Above section has shown that the ratio R1 is sensitive to the electron den-

sity ne, while it is insensitive to the electron temperature Te. Obviously this

ratio is a good diagnostic tool for the electron density ne. Moreover, the lab-

oratory measurement and theoretical calculation indicate that emission lines

relevant to the ratio R1 are the strongest lines of Ar XIV and not contami-

nated by other Ar lines. So we can use R1 to diagnose the electron density

of the laboratory plasma. By comparison between the measured value and

theoretical calculation as shown by the ﬁlled diamond in Fig. 1, the electron

density ne = 5.6 × 1010cm−3 is derived. This result is consistent with value

6.0×1010cm−3 recently diagnosed by Chen et al. [34] using triplet line intensity

ratio of He-like N ion.

Table 2 shows the diagnosed electron densities of the EBIT-II plasma from dif-

ferent line ratios. They are obtained by comparing the theoretical line ratios

with the experimental measurements which are indicated by the ﬁlled dia-

monds in Fig. 1—3. Given the uncertainties in the theoretical and measured

line ratios, the derived values of log ne would be expected to be accurate within

±0.3 dex. The results corresponding to logTe(K)=6.5 shown in Table 2, indi-

cate that the discrepancies of diagnosed electron density from R1, R2 and R3

do not exceed ±0.25 dex. The consistency of the diagnosed electron density

from R1, R2 and R3 further conﬁrms that our results are reliable. R2 predicts a

relative higher electron density compared to R1 and R3 at logTe(K)=6.5. Part

of the reason may be due to the temperature sensitivity of R2 as shown in Fig.

12

electron density (ne in cm−3) at temperature logTe(K)=6.3 (dotted line), 6.5 (solid

line) and 6.7 (dashed line)
6. A change in Te of 0.2 dex leads to 10% variation in R2 at ne = 1011cm−3,

which can explain the relative higher diagnosed electron density from it. The

measured value of R4 (6.33) exceeds the high density-sensitive limit, so no

electron density can be derived as shown by Fig. 2. The line at 31.360 ˚A is

strongly shadowed by Ar XII line at 31.374 ˚A [22], therefore no reliable mea-

sured line intensity is available, which results in large uncertainty in R5. The

13

line at 32.014 ˚A blends with weak lines of Ar XIII at this wavelength, so a

higher electron density is derived from R6.

Fig. 6 shows that the ratio R2 is slightly sensitive to the electron temperature.

At a lower electron temperature logTe(K)=6.3, the derived electron density

from R2 can be consistent with that from R1 and R3 within a much smaller

uncertainty range (25%). Decreasing temperature from logTe(K)=6.5 to 6.3,

the uncertainty range decreases from 78% to 25% as shown in Table 2. Which

indicates that the electron temperature of the laboratory plasma is lower than

that of maximum Ar XIV fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium.

Table 3 lists the experimental and theoretical intensity ratios at logTe(K)=6.5

and ne = 5.6 × 1010cm−3. For ratios R2 and R6, poor consistencies between

the measurements and theoretical calculations can be found in Table 3. The

temperature-sensitivity can explain the discrepancy for R2, while the contri-

bution from those weakly Ar XIII lines around 32.014 ˚A line can explain the

deviation for R6. The large discrepancy for R4 may be due to that the 30.344 ˚A

line is strongly contaminated by Ar XIII lines located at this wavelength re-

gion [22].

4 Conclusion

We found that intensity ratios R1—R6 of emission lines arising from n = 3 − 2

transitions of Ar XIV are sensitive to electron density. And the ratio R1 is

insensitive to electron temperature. For example, a change in ne of 1 dex leads

to variation with factor ∼4.4 in R1, while a change in Te of 0.2 dex (i.e. 58%)

leads to a less than 1% variation at ne = 109 cm−3, up to 3% at ne = 1011

cm−3. Therefore R1 is very useful for the electron density diagnostics of labo-

ratory and astrophysical plasmas. The two lines of Ar XIV relevant to R1 are

the strongest, and no blended Ar lines have been detected in the experiment

conducted by Lepson et al. [22] in EBIT-II. By comparison between the ex-

perimental value and theoretical line intensity ratio R1, an electron density of

ne = 5.6 × 1010cm−3 of the laboratory plasma is derived, which is consistent

with value 6.0 × 1010cm−3 recently diagnosed by Chen et al. [34] using triplet

line of N VI. The derived electron densities from R2 and R3, are also consis-

tent with that within uncertainty, which further conﬁrms that our results are

reliable. In addition, the electron density derived from these ratios eliminates

the uncertainty from ionization balance and electron abundance determina-

tion. At a lower logarithmic electron temperature (logTe(K)=6.3), the derived

electron density from R2 can be consistent with that from R1 and R3 within

15

a much smaller uncertainty range (25%). Which indicates the temperature of

the laboratory plasma is lower than logTe(K)=6.5.

In this paper, the nonlinear theory of plasma waves is extended to the plasmas that their
equilibrium state are speciﬁed by the non-Maxwellian (here kappa) distribution. We believe
that the extension is very important since most of the space and some of laboratory plasmas are
not in the Maxwellian equilibrium. Although the linear theory of this issue has been known for
the decades but, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt in opening the gate to the nonlinear
world of plasma waves with the non-Maxwellian equilibrium. As an example the ion-acoustic
solitons are studied in this framework taking into account the electron trapping in the trough
of longitudinal ﬁeld. It is shown, as the most important result regarding to the non-Maxwillian
equilibrium, that there is the possibility for the ion-acoustic solitons to move subsonically. The
solitons velocity and their width are monotonically increasing functions of spectral index (κ)
and approach to the their Maxwellian values as κ → ∞.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the natural space environment, e.g., planetary magnetospheres, astrophysical plasmas, and the solar wind,
plasmas are generally observed to possess a non-Maxwellian high energy tail [1–5]. A useful distribution function
to model such plasmas is the generalized Lorentzian (kappa) distribution. Important features of κ distribution
are that, ﬁrst, at high velocities the distribution obeys an inverse power law, and that, second, for all velocities,
in the limit as the spectral index approaches to large values the distribution tends to the Maxwellian distri-
bution.
In this sense, the kappa distribution is a generalization of the Maxwellian distribution. Vasyliunas
appears to have been the ﬁrst to employ the general form of the kappa distribution and to note its relation to
the Maxwellian [1]. Kappa distribution have been used to analyze and interpret spacecraft data on the earth’s
magnetospheric plasma sheet [2], the solar wind [3], Jupiter [4], and Saturn [5]. In practice it is found that many
space plasmas can be modeled more eﬀectively by a superposition of kappa distribution than by Maxwellians.
In the context of both space and laboratory plasmas Hasegawa et.al. [6] showed that the equilibrium state of
the distribution function for a plasma immersed in superthermal radiation resembles a Lorentzian-type distri-
bution.The Maxwellian and kappa distributions diﬀer substantially in the high energy tail, but the diﬀerences
become less signiﬁcant as κ increases.

Although the kappa distribution has been known for several decades, it has been mostly used for the study
of linear waves. Under linear approximation, kappa distribution employed to study the dispersive properties
as well as the rate of Landau damping for a number of wave modes in space plasmas such as the electron
plasma waves, ion acoustic waves, and electromagnetic R-mode and L-mode waves and noted that the presence
of a high energy tail leads to a signiﬁcant change in the damping rate of the interested wave compared to
that of Maxwellian plasma [6,7]. However, the linear approximation can break down because of various well-
known instability mechanisms leading to the nonlinear regime. Thus, it provides a motivation for studying
the nonlinear eﬀect in a plasma medium that its equilibrium state is non-Maxwellian. Note that the plasma
equilibrium always has essential inﬂuence on the nonlinear dynamics. Nonlinear eﬀects either directly depends
on the velocity distribution, such as particle trapping or is aﬀected through the average of the distribution
function.

In this paper, the kappa distribution function is used in the study of the ion-acoustic soliton. The ion-acoustic
solitons in a plasma with cold ions were initially investigated by Sagdeev [8]. He assumed that the distribution of
the electrons in the ﬁeld of the wave has the equilibrium (Boltzmann) form. However, in the cases that particles
trapping by the potential ﬁeld of the wave is possible, the arrangement of particles in the phase space drastically
changes and the closed trajectories are obtained. These particles cause a large deviation of distribution function

in comparison to the case when the trapped particles are not considered. Here, we follow the well-established
kinetic model of trapping in an adiabatically varying ﬁeld [9,10].

The present paper is devoted to a detailed calculations of the electron density from the kappa distribution
function, including the eﬀects of electron trapping. Since the density can not be expressed in terms of simple
functions, therefore assuming a small potential energy (in comparison to the thermal energy), a Taylor expansion
of the electron density is obtained. The electron density together with the ﬂuid equations for the ions and the
Poisson’s equation form a complete set of equations that are used to study the ion-acoustic solitons. It is shown,
as the most important result, that the deviation from Maxwellian distribution makes it possible to construct
the localized structures which move subsonically. To our knowledge this result is quite new. Moreover, the
soliton velocity and width decrease according to the measure of deviation.

The lay out of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we give the basic mathematical calculation of the electron
density. In Sec. III the complete formalism and the results are presented. Section IV is devoted to the summery
and conclusions.

Let us begin with the one dimensional kappa distribution function, fκ (Fig. 1), for a free system as follows:

As it was mentioned earlier, in a collisionless plasma the distribution of the trapped electrons may diﬀer
signiﬁcantly from the equilibrium distribution, which inﬂuences the properties of the wave. The particles

FIG. 3. The error versus the normalized potential energy.

It is clear that by increasing the κ the error decreases. Therefore, in order to keep the error of the order of

one percent, the U 2 term has to be kept in the density and the upper limit of the normalized potential energy
should be restricted to 0.1.

FIG. 5. The ion-acoustic soliton velocity versus κ.

It is very important to note that, the deviation form Maxwellian distribution (ﬁnite κ) makes it possible
to construct ion-acoustic solitons in the subsonic regime (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). As it was mentioned earlier,
the velocity of ion-acoustic solitons is a monotonically increasing function of its maximum amplitude. In the
amplitude interval over which the above theory is based (0
0.1), as it is seen from Figs. 4 and 5,
that solitons, resulting from small κ (κ < 6) are subsonic. Solitons associated with the larger κ, according to
their maximum amplitude move sub or supersonically. Figure 6 shows the boundary of subsonic and supersonic
regimes (M = 1).

For larger κ the amplitude interval over which the solitons are subsonic gets narrower. However, the existence
of subsonic soliton is particular result of non-Maxwellian plasmas. Solitons move supersonically all over the
amplitude interval just when κ approaches to inﬁnity, or in the other words, when the plasma electrons become

Maxwellian.

We now discuss the width of the soliton. The width of the soliton is deﬁned as

Figures 7 and 8 exhibit the dependence of the width ∆ on the maximum amplitude φm and κ. Apparently, for
any φm the width of the solitons resulting from non-Maxwellian deviation is narrower according to the measure
of its deviation from Maxwellian equilibrium.

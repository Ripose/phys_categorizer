Abstract

This report is a self-contained and comprehensive review of the physics of
propagating pulses of high-intensity high-energy particle beams in pre-existing
or self-generated plasmas. The ﬁrst part is a systematic overview of the theory
pertaining to propagation, plasma self-generation, energy/current-losses, and sta-
bility of such pulses. The second part reviews the major full-scale propagation
experiments which have been carried out, in atmospheric and outer-space plas-
mas, to assess the validity of theoretical models. It is found that the data available
on these experiments demonstrate that range and stability are in agreement with
theory. In particular, stable self-pinched propagation of high-current beams in the
atmosphere is possible over distances on the order of several Nordsieck lengths.

Introduction

This report deals in a comprehensive manner with theoretical and experimental
plasma-physics and accelerator-physics research which have been actively fol-
lowed or done by the author over the past twenty-ﬁve years, that is starting from
approximately the time of the beginning of the construction of the “Advanced Test
Accelerator” (ATA) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and of the
creation of the “Accelerator Technology” division (AT) at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory.

In order to understand the relevance of the key experiments, which started to
give signiﬁcant data in the mid-1980s, it is important to understand the theory
underlying the numerous plasma-physics effects at work when a high-intensity
beam-pulse of particles propagates in a background gas or through the atmosphere.
Since there is no published text book or monograph covering this subject in a
systematic manner, Chapters 2 to 7 attempt to make a synthesis of numerous
published articles and many informal reports which deal with one or another
aspect of this theory. As shown by the bibliography, this meant studying many
papers published over the past ﬁfty years, often dealing only indirectly with the
subject, in order to extract the pertinent information necessary to make a consistent
theoretical model.

In the second part of the report, Chapters 8 to 10, the focus is on the acceler-
ator facilities and the beam propagation experiments which are signiﬁcant for the
purpose of establishing the feasibility of generating suitable high-intensity high-
energy particle beams, and of propagating them in outer-space plasmas or through
the atmosphere. The difﬁculty, here, is that the openly available data is more of
a qualitative than quantitative nature, which is precisely why a thorough under-
standing of the plasma-physics pertinent to these experiments is so important. In

5

these chapters, which deal with technologies at the frontier of the state-of-the-art,
an effort is made to refer to the implications of the most advanced theoretical
ideas and technologies, in order to show how much the possible future engineering
development of high-power particle beam generation/propagation technology still
depends on ongoing research.

While we said that there appears to be no published text book or monograph
covering the subject of this report in a systematic manner,1 there is a growing
number of excellent books available on the physics of charged particle beams and
their applications. The books by J.D. Lawson [1], R.B. Miller [2], S. Humphries
Jr. [3, 4], and M. Reiser [5], are possibly the most useful in the context of the
present report.

As the information and research summarized in this report extend over so many
years, there are many people to thank for their direct and indirect contributions
to it. While I cannot mention all of them, I wish in particular to thank my
former colleagues at CERN (where this work started): Claude Bovey, Steve Geer,
Peter Jenni, Pierre Lef`evre, Claude Metzger, Dieter Moehl, Emilio Picasso, Peter
Sonderegger, Daniel Treille, and Horst Wachsmuth; as well as Frank Barnaby and
Bhupendra Jasani at SIPRI (where part of this report was written); and last but not
least, Jean-Pierre Hurni at ISRI.

1One exception appears to be the lecture notes prepared by Prof. K.E. Woehler, Department of
Physics, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, for his course PH 4959 — Physics of directed
energy weapons: Part I, Particle beam weapons (March 1981) 120 pp; Part II, Particle accelerators
(March 1981) 60 pp. However, the level and scope of these lectures are more elementary and less
comprehensive than those of the present report.

Some preliminary deﬁnitions

A particle beam pulse may be thought of as an ensemble of moving particles whose
trajectories constitute a “bundle.” The diameter of this bundle is small compared
with its length, and the trajectories generally make a small angle with the “axis.”
The complete description of the evolution of such a system of interacting particles,
especially if they propagate through a gas or plasma, is in general very complicated.
However, in many cases, the beam pulse can be characterized statistically by the
RMS (i.e., “root mean squared”) values of its radius, length, angular spread,
energy spread, etc. A good description is then provided by the so-called envelope
equations giving the RMS radius (or length) of the pulse as a function of time or
propagation distance.

A most important concept speciﬁcally related to particle beams is that of
emittance, which can be considered as a measure of the disorder in the motion of
the particles relative to the average motion of the beam [6]. In the general case
it is necessary to distinguish between the transverse and longitudinal emittances,
i.e., ǫ⊥⊥⊥ and ǫkkk, which will be deﬁned in the ﬁrst section of the next chapter. Since
an emittance is basically the product of the extent of a spatial distribution along a
given direction by an angular spread, i.e., a length times an angle, it is generally
measured in units of “m

rad.”

·

A concept that is related to beam emittance is that of beam brightness, i.e.,
current divided by angular beam spread, which means that low-emittance implies
high-brightness, and vice versa. Both concepts are often used interchangeably to
qualify a high-power directed beam, but we will use only the concept of emittance
in the theoretical sections of this report.

In order to simplify the calculations, the usual treatment generally assumes
that ˜v⊥⊥⊥ and ˜vkkk, the RMS values of the random components of the transverse (or

7

perpendicular) and longitudinal (or parallel) velocities, are small compared with
the mean longitudinal drift velocity v = βc :

˜v2
⊥⊥⊥ ≪

β2c2 , ˜v2

β2c2 .

kkk ≪

(2.1)

This is the paraxial approximation and the particle trajectories deviate only slightly
from parallel straight lines.
In such a model, the beam particle momentum p,
total energy W , and kinetic energy K are slowly changing parameters with the
longitudinal distance. With γ = 1/

p = γβmc , W = γmc2 , K = (γ

In the case of charged particle beams, we will see that the paraxial approxima-
tion is equivalent to the statement that the effective beam current IE generating the
electromagnetic self-ﬁelds is small compared with the Alfv´en current IA deﬁned

In the discussion of problems like beam-plasma interaction and stability, the
most convenient radial scale is not the RMS radius ˜a = √r2, but the scale radius
a deﬁned such that

JB(0) =

πa2

(2.4)

where JB(r) is the current density and IB the total beam current.

We will use a cylindrical coordinate system with radial distance r =

x2 + y2,
azimuthal angle θ and longitudinal distance z. In the beam frame, we will replace
the longitudinal variable z by a time coordinate τ which is zero at the beam head
and equal to ∆τ , the pulse duration, at the tail-end.

In the following sections we will ﬁrst review the envelope equations for neutral
and charged particle beams. We will assume homogeneous and constant back-
ground conditions, and neglect transient effects and instabilities. Second, we will
examine the transient effects at the head of a charged beam when it is ﬁred into
a initially neutral gas such as the atmosphere which is turned into a plasma by
the beam. Finally, we will examine the main possible instabilities affecting the
propagation of such a beam.

Particle beam propagation in a
vacuum or a tenuous plasma

3.1 Neutral beam in a vacuum

In the absence of collisions between the particles, the individual trajectories of
neutral particles propagating in a vacuum are all straight lines. The envelope
equations can then directly be derived from kinematics [8]. For a beam pulse with
axial symmetry, the RMS radius ˜a, and the RMS half-length ˜ℓ, are given by:

˜a′′ =

ǫ2
˜a3 , ˜ℓ′′ =
⊥⊥⊥

ǫ2
kkk
˜ℓ3

.

In these envelope equations, the primes denote derivation with respect to
the longitudinal coordinate z. The constant ǫ⊥⊥⊥ and ǫkkk are the transverse and
longitudinal emittances which characterize the random distribution of the particles
in the beam. Speciﬁcally

⊥⊥⊥ = ˜a2 (˜v⊥⊥⊥)2
ǫ2

(˜a′)2

kkk = ˜ℓ2 (˜vkkk)2

As ǫ⊥⊥⊥ and ǫkkk are constant of motion, they can be measured most conveniently at
the point where the beam envelope forms a waist. At such a point ˜a′ = 0 or ˜ℓ = 0,
and

ǫ⊥⊥⊥ = ˜a˜α , ǫkkk =

˜ℓ

.

where, in the paraxial limit, ˜α is the RMS angular spread and ∆W/W the RMS
energy spread of the beam. The emittances ǫ⊥⊥⊥ and ǫkkk are thus characteristic of the

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

beam quality: a small transverse emittance corresponds to a well collimated small
angular divergence beam, and a small longitudinal emittance to a short pulse with
a small energy spread.

For possible applications for space-based beam weapon systems, the solutions
of (3.1) have one essential feature: for a given emittance, and at a ﬁxed distance z
from the accelerator generating the beam, the minimum beam spot size is inversely
proportional to its initial radius ˜a0:

˜amin = z

ǫ⊥⊥⊥
˜a0

(3.4)

This minimum is achieved for ˜a′
0 = ˜a0/z and shows that the critical parameter
in focusing the beam is its emittance and not just its angular spread or radius.
Similarly, the longitudinal emittance determines the minimum duration of beam
pulse, and is thus an essential parameter for compressing the beam into short pulses
at the target. According to (3.4), in order to focus a neutral beam into 1 m radius
at 1000 km, one would, for example, need a beam with an initial radius of 20 cm
rad. An accelerator with such an emittance, and
and an emittance of 2
a focusing system for such a beam, are currently under development at the Los
Alamos Scientiﬁc Laboratory in the USA [9].

3.2 Charged beam in a vacuum

When a charged particle beam is launched into a vacuum, the beam will tend
to spread apart because of its emittance and the effect of the Coulomb repulsion
between like charges, which is particularly strong if the beam energy is low.
However, for relativistic beams, this is not the main problem with propagation
in a complete vacuum: when an unneutralized beam leaves the accelerator, the
accelerator becomes charged with the opposite sign, pulling the beam particles
back and causing them to decelerate. Let us examine the importance of these
effects.

In the paraxial limit the radial electrostatic force on a particle within a beam

at a distance r from the axis is

Fe = 1
2

W
r

IB(r)
IA

(3.5)

where IB(r) is the total current ﬂowing within the radius r. The outward-directed
force is partially compensated for by the inward-directed pinch force due to the

10

azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld generated by the beam current this radius:

As β2 < 1, the net force Fe + Fm is outward-directed, and causes the beam to
spread apart.

The radial envelope equation combining the effect of the emittance and those

of the electro-magnetic self-ﬁeld is [10]:

In order to estimate the effect of the electromagnetic spreading term, one can ﬁrst
neglect the emittance in (3.7). The distance over which a beam has to propagate
in order for it radius to double is the approximately given by [11]:

With an initial radius of a = 20 cm, a kinetic energy of 500 MeV and a current of
100 mA, this distance would be about 5000 km for electrons, but only 5 km for a
proton beam with the same characteristics. But this is estimated from radial beam
divergence alone. In fact, as there is no return current the particle will also be
slowed down under the action of the longitudinal restoring force due to charging
up of the spacecraft launching the beam. This effect puts a limit to the range of
charged particles in a vacuum. At relativistic energies [12],

and both proton and electron beams of the above example would have a range of
less than 1 km. This calculation alone would tend to rule out the use of charged
particle streams as possible beam weapons in a vacuum. However, as will be
examined now, if such beams were injected into outer space, which is in fact a
dilute plasma and not a vacuum, the situation can be very different.

Chapter 4

Particle beam propagation in a
dense gas or plasma

4.1 Charged beam in a plasma : the Bennett pinch

Charged particle beams for use as directed energy weapons are in general injected
either into the atmosphere for ground- and aircraft-based systems, or into a plasma
for space-based systems. In the case of atmospheric systems, the beam will enter an
initially neutral atmosphere and, by ionizing the air, turn it into a plasma along the
beam path. In the case of outer-space systems, the plasma will be the ionosphere
for near earth orbiting systems, or the interstellar environment. In both cases, the
transient phenomena occurring at the head of a beam pulse are complicated. We
will thus concentrate ﬁrst on inﬁnitely long beams in the paraxial approximation.
Similarly, we will assume that the plasma can be sufﬁciently well described for
our purpose by a scalar conductivity σ given by

where ν is the collision frequency, me the rest mass and ne the number density of
the conductivity electrons.

In order to appreciate the relative importance of the plasma background for
beam propagation, it is sufﬁcient to compare the plasma density ne to the beam
particle density nb. On the beam axis, according to (3.1),

For example, in the case of a relativistic beam with IB = 100 mA and a = 20
104 cm−3. In comparison, in the ionosphere between an altitude
cm, nb = 1.6
of 100 to 2000 km, the electron number density ne is on the same order or larger.
Therefore, plasma effects cannot be ignored.

×

The ﬁrst effect of a plasma background is that, because of quasi-neutrality,
the excess charge locally introduced by the passage of the beam will tend to be
neutralized on a time scale τe set by the plasma conductivity:

As a result, the space charged force (3.5) will be reduced to a value

τe =

ǫ0
σ

Fe = 1

2(1

−

r

IB(r)

where fe is the space charge neutralization fraction.

The actual physical processes involved at the microscopic level are different
depending upon the sign of the electric charge of the beam particles. For an
electron beam, the electric ﬁeld will quickly expel the plasma electrons and the
neutralization will be provided by the positive ions left within the beam. Assuming
the ions not to be able to move signiﬁcantly during the passage of the beam pulse,
the maximum charge neutralization fraction will be fe =
in cases where
ni < nb. In the case of a proton beam, electrons from the plasma surrounding
the beam will be attracted into the beam region. The neutralizing fraction can be
1 even when ne < nb. The fact that the charge neutralizing particles have very
different masses means that the transient phenomena and stability conditions can
ni > nb,
be different in the two beams. However, in dense plasma, i.e., when ne ≈
most properties will be similar. In particular, fe will essentially be one for beam
pulses of duration longer than τe and radius smaller than c/τe.

The second main effect of a plasma background is that return current can be
established. This current is driven by Ez, the longitudinal electric ﬁeld induced
by the beam. From Faraday’s law of induction

dimensionless inductance. For axially symmetric beams

where b is the maximum radius out to which the plasma background is signiﬁcantly
affected by the beam. For instance, in beam-generated plasmas, b is normally
determined by the extent of induced breakdown around the beam head. Typically,
1. At the boundary of this region the conductivity becomes too
b/a
small to insure quasineutrality. The charge imbalance from the beam is conducted
to this surface, which is thus the path along which the beam current not neutralized
by the plasma current is returned to the accelerator. For Ohm’s law, J = σE, the
longitudinal component of the plasma current is then

L ≈

is by deﬁnition the magnetic diffusion time of the plasma. From (4.5) it turns out
that the plasma current will in effect decrease the beam current and thus reduce
the magnetic pinch force. This is usually written as

function of the beam current and shape variations, the plasma current, and thus
fm, will be largest at the beam head. Within the pulse, fm will decrease to zero on
a time scale set by the magnetic diffusion time.

Assuming f e and f m to be independent of r, the envelope equation including

the plasma effect is then [10]

The effective current contains charge imbalance as well as true beam and plasma
currents. It can have both signs, and the forces can either tend to separate or, on
the contrary, to pinch the beam. When IE is positive, a stationary solution with
˜a′′ = ˜a′ = 0 is possible. This is the Bennett pinch solution, and in that case (4.10)

Figure 4.1: The pinch effect. The photograph, taken in the early 1950s at the
Argonne cyclotron (near Chicago), shows the glow produced when sending the
full deuteron beam into the atmosphere. Because of ionization the air near the
beam is turned into a plasma which keeps the beam from expanding radially
under the effect of Coulomb repulsion between like-charged particles: This is the
“Bennett pinch effect,” ﬁrst described by Willard H. Bennet in 1934 to explain
focusing effects and breakdown in the residual gas of high-voltage electronic
tubes, and later applied to the propagation of interstellar and interplanetary self-
focussed beams of particles, such as proton streams traveling from the sun towards
the earth. As the beam loses energy and intensity because of interactions with
atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen nuclei, plasma generation becomes less efﬁcient
and the beam progressively expands: This is the “Nordsieck effect,” after the
name of Arnold Nordsieck who is generally credited for having ﬁrst explained
this expansion. Ultimately, when the plasma effects become to weak to pinch the
beam, it breaks-up. This happens at a propagation distance on the order of the
so-called “Nordsieck length.”

From (4.11) we see that the Bennett pinch radius (4.12) is minimum for fe = 1
and fm = 0. In that case IE = IB, the pinch force is maximum and the beam
is fully pinched. The Bennett pinch solution exists, however, only in the paraxial
limit. This can be seen from (4.12) and (3.2) which imply

In a Bennett pinch, the beam particles perform harmonic motion around the

which is also independent of the beam proﬁle. In the special case of a beam with
a constant current density out to a radius a, the betatron frequency is constant and
equal to (4.15).

For propagating self-pinched beams, the most natural equilibrium density
proﬁles are those corresponding to a Maxwellian (i.e., Gaussian) transverse energy
distribution [14].

Possible equilibria include ﬁlamentary current ﬂows along the axis, but the

In a beam with the Bennett proﬁle (4.16), the betatron frequency ω2

uniformly distributed between zero and the maximum given by (4.15).

The signiﬁcance of the Bennett pinch is that when a beam is injected in a gas
or plasma, sufﬁciently dense to suppress the effect of the space charge repulsion,
the beam may pinch down to a minimum constant radius and propagate over large
distances.
In particular, because the plasma background provides a means for
carrying the return current, the range is no more strictly limited as ii the case of
charged beams in vacuum. The limit to the propagation distance will now be set
by scattering, energy loss, instabilities, etc.

The fact that the net charge transported by a beam pulse traveling through a
plasma is equal to the charge of the beam itself, even when the beam is launched
from a ground plane, is not an obvious result. It is, however, correct, even when
the plasma is generated within the pulser by beam-gas interaction [17].

16

The Bennett pinch is important in many area of science and technology. In
particular, it is important for understanding interplanetary particle streams [13]
and studying the ionosphere with beams launched from rockets [18] or the space
shuttle [19]. It has many applications in thermonuclear fusion research and has
been envisaged as a means for accumulating high energy electrons in large rings
in outer space. Such rings could be used to store energy and subsequently gen-
erate synchrotron radiation or free electron laser optical beams [20]. Finally, for
endo-atmospheric beam weapon, the pinch effect provides the means for radially
conﬁning charged particle beams.

The Bennett pinch condition IE > 0 requires fe > 1/γ2 when fm = 0. For
103, this condition is easily satisﬁed, even in very
high energy beams, i.e., γ = 10
low density plasmas. This allows the transport of beams with current densities
higher than the plasma density by a factor γ2.

−

The practicality of this method for stable propagation of beams over large
distances in a low pressure atmosphere was demonstrated for electrons in 1972
[21]. For beams such as those considered at the end of the previous paragraph,
the pinch effect would provide an ultimate theoretical range of many thousands of
kilometers. However, the practical use of such beams in outer space will, in fact,
be limited by the effect on them of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. On the other hand, in
a full density atmosphere, the possibility of using the pinch effect to propagate
a charged-particle beam has still to be experimentally demonstrated. This is the
goal of various large scale experiments currently underway in several laboratories
[22, 23].

4.2 Effect of magnetic ﬁelds : neutral plasma beams

The region above the atmosphere in which an orbiting charged particle beam
weapon might be deployed contains plasma and magnetic ﬁelds of both solar and
terrestrial origin. The plasma may enable electron or proton beams to pinch and
propagate over large distances, but the magnetic ﬁeld would strongly affect the
beam trajectory in most cases.

In a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B the radius of curvature of a particle of

charge q is

an endo-atmospheric system with a range of a few kilometers. However, for an
outer-space system with a required range of several thousands of kilometers, the
beam would spiral much as it did in the low energy beam experiment performed
on the space shuttle [19].

For beam without current neutralization (i.e., fm = 0), the effect of an external
magnetic ﬁeld is essentially the same as that on the beam particles taken individ-
ually. In that case, (4.17) applies directly to the beam as a whole, which has been

veriﬁed experimentally [24]. On the other hand, if fm 6
an external magnetic ﬁeld on a beam would be smaller, and would vanish in the
extreme case of a beam with fully neutralized current.

This phenomenon is most easily understood in the ideal case of a neutral
plasma beam consisting of co-moving electrons and ions: electrons and ions are
deﬂected in opposite directions and create a polarization electric ﬁeld. This ﬁeld
exactly cancels the force of the external magnetic ﬁeld and the beam continues
undeﬂected, loosing, however, particles from the polarization layers [25]. This
effect has been recently investigated experimentally for a charge-neutral beam
consisting of electrons and protons [26]. For such a beam, the effective current
(4.11) is obviously zero. The envelope equation (4.10) reduces then to that of
neutral beam and, in the absence of pinch effect, the neutral plasma beam would
expand through the effect of its emittance [27].

A neutral plasma beam, also called plasmo¨id beam, would thus be an alternative
to a neutral particle beam for outer space systems. The main problem is to generate
such a plasmo¨id beam with a sufﬁciently small emittance for the range to be useful,
and to overcome the problem of the beam losses at the boundary layers.

In an atmosphere with a pressure of about 1 Torr, stable propagation conditions
with fe = fm = 1 were discovered in early electron beam experiments, ﬁrst in the
United States [28, 29], and later in the Soviet Union [12]. In these experiments, the
current neutralization was provided by slowly counterstreaming plasma electrons.
The fact that such a conﬁguration is stable and unaffected by an external magnetic
ﬁeld would make it attractive, in principle, for propagating a beam in a reduced
density channel. However, the beam is not pinched, and would thus quickly spread
apart because of collisions with the gas molecules.

18

4.3 Charged beam in a dense gas or plasma : Nord-

sieck equation

When a beam propagates in a dense gas or plasma, the collisions with the electrons
and nuclei result in a loss of energy by the beam current when particles can
effectively be removed from the beam by interactions with nuclei. Furthermore,
by increasing the angular and energy spread of the beam, the collisions lead to a
continuous increase in both transverse and longitudinal emittance. In the paraxial
approximation the full radial envelope equation taking energy loss and scattering
into account is as follows [10, 15]:

This result is obtained from kinetic theory which shows [15] that a self-pinched

Coulomb multiple scattering in the background gas. In agreement with Liouville’s
theorem [1], the emittance enters this formula through the product pe which is

varying function of energy and S equal 2 to 3 keV/cm in air at STP for 1 GeV
single-charged particles. The second term is present only for electron beams and
corresponds to bremsstrahlung radiation losses [30]. (Bremsstrahlung emission is
negligible for particles of mass heavier than electrons). The third term corresponds
to the ohmic losses in the induced longitudinal electric ﬁeld. These losses which
are associated with the charge and current neutralization process are concentrated
in the head of the beam where they contribute to heating the plasma electrons.

The beam current decreases because of collisions with nuclei. In the case of
proton beams, both inelastic and elastic nuclear collisions will effectively remove
particles from the beam. Therefore, in that case, the effective beam current (4.11)
will vary with z as

IE(z) = IE(0) exp(

z/Xn)

−

(4.21)

where Xn is the nuclear collision length, about 500 m in air at STP for high
energy proton beams. In the case of electron beams, the pronounced statistical
character of bremsstrahlung radiation losses will result in a wide energy spread for
propagations over distances of the order of one radiation length. The implication
of such a large increase in longitudinal emittance is that particles with energies
less than half the mean beam energy will in fact “evaporate” from the beam, thus
leaving behind a reduced current beam [32]. A calculation based on Bethe and
Heitler’s theory of straggling in bremsstrahlung emission [30] indicates that this
effect would account for a 30% loss in beam current for a high energy electron
beam propagating over one radiation length.

The solution of (4.18) has generally to be found numerically. However, con-
siderable insight can be gained in the quasistatic limit which is taken from the

The Nordsieck equation can be solved explicitly for several cases of inter-

For example, the maximum power of the 10 kA, 50 MeV, ATA beam is P0 =

300 m in air at STP, the typical propagation length of a single ATA beam

pulse should be on the order of zN ≈

20 m.

≈

In order to check the validity of these conclusions, we have solved (4.18) for
10 GeV, 10 kA beams of electrons, protons and muons in air at STP, modeling
all physical effects such as multiple scattering and energy losses as precisely as
possible. (See Figure 2.) This corresponds to an initial beam power P0 = 6.6PN .
The range of the proton beam is about 1 km, as expected. But the range of the
electron beam is only 400 m. This discrepancy is the result of the approximation
made in deriving the Nordsieck equation (4.22) and of neglecting straggling. The
muon beam, which would be much more difﬁcult to produce in practice than an
electron or proton beam, is included for comparison. As bremsstrahlungs and
nuclear interactions are negligible for these particles, the muon beam range is of
course much larger. (See Figures 2 and 3.) The range of proton beams in air is

23

thus strictly limited by the nuclear interaction length, and electron beams by the
radiation length. However, as these lengths depend directly upon the atmospheric
density, the corresponding ranges will increase in proportion to the decrease in
atmospheric density.

Finally, in order to compare the beam expansion theory given in this section to
the data, and therefore to validate the extrapolations given in Figures 2 and 3, we
have simulated and found good agreement with the beam expansion measurements
given in reference [16]. In these measurements, the ASTRON induction linear
accelerator of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was used to propagate
a 250 ns, 0.85 kA, 5 MeV electron beam pulse over a distance up to 16 meters in
reduced density nitrogen. This agreement can be also be used to predict with some
conﬁdence the propagation characteristics of the 10 kA, 50 MeV, ATA beam. It is
then found that one e-folding beam-radius increase corresponds to a propagation
distance of about 20 m in a sea-level air, in excellent agreement with the analytical
estimate given by equation (4.25), and that the beam radius increases to about 10
times its initial value after propagating a distance of about 35 m.

Injection of a high-power beam into
the atmosphere

5.1 Plasma generation by a particle beam

−

In a endo-atmospheric system, except when the beam is launched into the iono-
sphere or a pre-formed plasma channel, the beam will, in general, be injected into
initially un-ionized air. At the very head of a beam pulse, there is thus no back-
ground plasma and therefore, both fe and fm are zero. The beam head, therefore,
expands at a rate governed by the net radial electromagnetic force, emittance and
scattering. However, as the beam ionizes the air, a plasma of increasing density
builds up and, as plasma currents start ﬂowing, the space charge gets progressively
neutralized. When γ2(fmβ2
fe) = 1, IE = 0, the net electromagnetic force
changes sign, and the beam stops expanding and starts pinching down. During the
self-pinching of the beam, both the radius a and the effective beam current IE are
rapidly varying, and this happens while the beam current IB, which in practice
has a ﬁnite rise-time, increases. As a result, a strong electric ﬁeld is induced.
This ﬁeld, given by (4.5), accelerates the plasma electrons, which, as they gain
sufﬁcient energy, start ionizing the gas as well. The rate of neutralization of the
beam thus increases, until it levels off as the decreasing beam radius approaches an
1. At this point, the induced electric
equilibrium radius given by (4.12) with fe ≈
ﬁeld becomes very small and, the plasma current IP , after having gone through
a maximum, starts decreasing according to (4.7). Finally, for a sufﬁciently long
pulse, after the plasma current has completely decayed, the beam becomes fully
pinched.

As a result of this process, the beam pulse takes on a characteristic “trumpet”

forces. Finally, in the low-conductivity free expansion region where the plasma
effects are not sufﬁcient to pinch the beam, the particles move away from each
other because of Coulomb repulsion.

neck region in which Ez and fm are maximum, the body in which fe ≈
Nordsieck’s equation becomes a good approximation of (4.18), and ﬁnally the tail
where fe = 1 and fm ≈

0. (See Figure 4.)

The description of this process requires an equation for the plasma electron
density ne and temperature Te so that the conductivity s, and thus τe and τm can
be calculated. Furthermore, in order that all quantities can be expressed self-
consistently an equation relating the various ﬁelds and current is needed. This last
equation is called the circuit equation. These equations, which describe quantities
directly related to the penetration distance of the beam into the gas, are best written
down as a function of the following variable:

τ = t

z/βc

(5.1)

−
τ has the dimension of the time and is a ﬁxed label for a given particle within
the pulse, provided this particle does not move relative to the beam head. For the
beam head τ = 0, and for the tail-end, τ is simply the beam pulse duration. (See
Figure 5.)

The circuit equation has to be derived from the full set of Maxwell’s equations.
However, provided that a similarity assumption is made on the radial proﬁle of the
various charge and current distributions, the circuit equation takes a remarkably
simple form. First, it has to be noticed that because the plasma electrons are mostly
generated directly by the beam, ne, and thus σ, will have radial distribution close
to that of IB. Second, as a consequence, the plasma current IP will also have a
distribution similar to IB [33] and fm, just like fe, will be independent of r. The
natural radial distribution function to take (for all quantities) is that of a Bennett

27

The second term on the right is the current associated with the charge neutralization
process and is thus important only at the beam head and neck. The third term is
the plasma return current IP . The last term is the displacement current which can
be generally neglected, except at the very head of the beam. In this equation, τe
and τm are calculated from the on-axis values of σ.

The exact form of the equation giving the plasma conductivity depends con-
siderably upon the chemical composition and the pressure of the gas. The general

The ﬁrst term is the direct beam ionization rate where S(β) is the Bethe’s stopping
power, and w = 33.7 eV for air, the energy required to create one electron-ion
pair. The second source term corresponds to ionization avalanche in the induced
electrical ﬁeld at the beam head. The third corresponds to conductivity electron
loss by attachement to various molecules, and the last one to losses by molecular
dissociative recombination. The rates νi, νa, and the coefﬁcient α, depend in
general on the gas pressure, the electric ﬁeld and the plasma temperature. In fact,
for a real gas like air, a complete description would require a set of rate equations
coupling the various populations of molecular and atomic nitrogen, oxygen, water,
etc., in various states of ionization to the beam source terms. This leads to the
development of complicated phenomenological models [36].

In order to calculate the conductivity σ, the collision frequency ν of the con-
ductivity electrons with the plasma is also needed. This is the sum of two terms:

ν = νe(Te, ng) + νi(Te, ng)

(5.4)

The ﬁrst term is the electron-neutral momentum transfer collision frequency, and
the second one the electron-electron collision frequency [35]. For dilute plasmas,
in which ne is less than a few per cent of ng, the molecular gas density, the second
term can generally be neglected.

Finally, a last equation giving the plasma temperature Te is also required.
This is generally done by phenomenologically relating Te to Ez [36, 37], or by
constructing an equation relating the conductivity σ to Joule heating, thermal
cooling by conduction and energy loss as free energy [38].

28

In conclusion, the plasma chemistry involved in the calculation of the conduc-
tivity is generally rather complicated. However, for short pulses in dense gases
such as air in the pressure range of 0.1 to 1 atmosphere, a good ﬁrst approximation

The four equations (4.18), (4.20), (5.2) and (5.3) constitute a full set of equa-
tions providing a complete 1-dimensional description of the propagation of a beam
pulse in a gas or plasma. The main assumptions leading to these equations are the
paraxial approximation, the description of the plasma by a scalar conductivity and
the similarity of all radial distributions. Whereas these coupled equations cannot
be solved in general without a computer, their main features and implications for
endo-atmospheric beam weapons can be derived by making some approximations.

When a high current beam pulse is injected into air at full atmospheric pressure,
the avalanche ionization term can be neglected and (5.3) can be solved explicitly to
give ne as a function of τ . With the further approximations (5.5), one can calculate

approximately to the the situation in which a beam head leaves the exit window of
an accelerator to penetrate into the atmosphere. Finally, we will assume a beam
current IB with an inﬁnitely short rise-time. Under these conditions, neglecting
the displacement current, the circuit equation (5.2) can be solved. With (5.9), the

current IP which turns out to be maximum at t = τp. The region where IP is
maximum can be deﬁned as the beam neck. However, as τp is calculated for a
beam with inﬁnitely short rise-time, it does not give the absolute position of the
beam neck. Nevertheless, τp can be used to calculate relative quantities, and in
particular the neutralization fractions at the point where the beam is pinching.
This is because in the beam head the plasma phenomena are dominant an to ﬁrst
the conductivity becomes smaller
approximation independent of the rise-time:
as the rise-time is reduced, but the inductive electric ﬁelds becomes greater, thus
resulting in the same plasma current when IB reaches its maximum [39].

For τ = τp, the charge neutralization is

10 kA, this is a rather strong limitation on the beam current. Indeed, for
As IG ≈
particle beam weapons, current in excess of IG are required for endo-atmospheric
systems, and this creates some problems.

These analytical results are in good agreement with detailed computer calcu-
lations which do not assume a constant beam radius [40]. In these calculations the
radius of the beam at the neck is well approximated by

which shows that for IB < IG, the neck radius is proportional to the beam current.

(cid:1)

The pinch condition is not the only one leading towards the requirement of
small current neutralization fractions. We will see, for instance, that a beam is
also more likely to be unstable when fm > 0.5. Therefore, it turns out that IG
corresponds to a critical beam current setting an upper limit to the current of a
beam pulse sent into the atmosphere.

It is interesting to notice that the maximum current neutralization fraction cal-
culated with (5.14) is in reasonable agreement with the result of detailed computer
calculations [37, 40]. For example, in the case of 10 kA, 50 MeV beam pulse
such as will be produced by the ATA accelerator which is under construction at
the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, we ﬁnd fmp = 0.50, whereas the computer
calculation [37] predicts fmp = 0.4. In that case a = 0.5 cm and b
10 cm;
therefore

= 1.5 and λ = 4.2.

≈

L

The maximum current neutralization fraction (5.14) is independent of pressure.
But, as pressure is reduced, the ionization by avalanche can no longer be neglected.
The result (5.14) is then a lower bound to the maximum current neutralization
fraction. For example, for the above mentioned ATA accelerator beam injected
into air at 0.1 atmospheric pressure, the computer calculation [37] give fmp = 0.8.

The maximum value of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld which appears during
the self-pinching of the beam can be calculated from the circuit equation. In ﬁrst
approximation one ﬁnds:

In the head region where Ez is maximum, a is of the order of b. Thus:

Ez,max = 2500

IB
b

For beam currents of 10 to 100 kA and head radii of 3 to 30 cm, we ﬁnd ﬁelds
of the order of 10 MV/m. This maximum electric ﬁeld is quite large and is
approximately independent of the beam current. This is because the beam head
radius becomes proportional to the beam current when IB > IG, as it is shown by
computer calculations [40].

In the body of a beam pulse long enough for τm to reach its asymptotic value
(5.7), the circuit equation becomes a linear equation with constant coefﬁcients. It
can then be solved easily. In particular, when neglecting te, the plasma current is

IP =

IB exp(

)fmp .

L

(5.19)

For the previous examples, the plasma current decay time
τm would be of 10 ns
and 35 ns at the respective pressures of 1 and 0.1 atmosphere. Thus, if fm is large
at the pinch point, the current neutralization fraction will remain almost constant
throughout the pulse, provided its length is less than

L

τm.

L

A last case of importance is that of a beam pulse injected into a plasma of such
a density that its conductivity remains constant. (This is in particular the case when
νe > νm in (5.4) so that σ becomes the Spitzer conducivity [41].) In that situation,
because the plasma density is high, plasma currents can start ﬂowing right from
the very beginning of the pulse. The current neutralization is therefore almost
complete at the beam head, and (5.19) with fmp = 1 will give the plasma current
throughout the pulse. Because of this large current neutralization, the beam head
will not be pinched even though charge neutralization is complete. Therefore, a
pulse injected into a plasma or preionized background will also have an expanded
head, and beam pinching then occurs as the longitudinal plasma current decays.

5.3 Beam head erosion and ohmic losses

In all situations, whether the beam is injected into a neutral gas or plasma, the
head of a pulse is not pinched and is followed by a neck in which there is a deep
spike in the longitudinal electric ﬁeld. The beam particles at the front of the pulse
will thus spread out radially and get lost, and those in the neck will lose energy
because of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld. As their energy decreases, the particles
in the neck will also experience more scattering, and both effects will combine

32

Figure 5.3: Beam neck proﬁle. The variations of the effective beam current IE,
plasma return current IP , kinetic energy K, longitudinal electric ﬁeld Ez, and
beam radius a, are shown in the neck region which separates the well-pinched
body from the freely-expanding head of the beam pulse.

to increase the pinch radius. Consequently, the beam head expends continuously,
and the neck region recesses progressively into the body of the pulse. (See Figure
6.)

This beam head erosion process has been studied both theoretically and ex-
perimentally [34, 40]. These studies show that after an initial transient period, the
erosion process results in an almost constant rate of decrease in the length of the
pulse as a function of the propagation distance.

The erosion rate can be estimated in a simple way by assuming that the particles
in the neck will get lost when their kinetic energy has dropped from its initial value
K down to some critical value K ∗ because of the ohmic losses in the longitudinal
electric ﬁeld. From (4.5) and (4.20), the erosion rate is thus

For a beam with K = 500 MeV, IE = 10 kA, and
= 1 at the neck, a beam pulse
length loss of δt = 10 ns corresponds to a range of 600 m. Beam head erosion is
thus a severe limitation to the propagation of short pulses.

L

Moreover, the estimate (5.20) has been obtained under the assumption that the
particles in the beam neck do not move axially relative to the particles in the body
of the pulse. This is a good approximation for electrons because in their case

The ohmic losses are maximum in the head. However, for short pulses, the
ohmic losses in the remainder of the pulse may also be important. From (4.7)

losses:

The maximum range is of course obtained for particles in the tail for the pulse
where τm is maximum and fm minimum.

The energy given up by ohmic losses primarily heats the plasma electrons.
After the passage of the beam pulse, this energy contributes in forming a channel
of hot air along the beam path. On the other hand, the energy lost in the form
of radiations or particles scattered out of the beam do not contribute substantially
into heating the air. The total energy deposited per unit length along the beam
trajectory can be calculated by integrating the collision and ohmic terms in (4.20)

high current beam, the energy depositions by ohmic losses can be larger than the
energy deposition by collisions. This happens when the gas pressure is low enough
for collisions to be negligible, or when the pulse is short. Energy deposition can
thus be enhanced by chopping a given pulse into a series of smaller pulses. If the
individual pulses of the pulse train propagate independently from another, they
will of course all be subject to erosion. The most efﬁcient conﬁguration for energy
deposition will thus be a compromise.

Stability of propagating high-power
beams

6.1 General considerations on beam stability

A crucial question concerning beam propagation is that of stability. Because of
the substantial source of free energy represented by the kinetic energy of the beam,
a variety of instabilities could be excited and ampliﬁed during propagation. For
the purpose of using high energy particle beams as weapons, the problem is to
ﬁnd a set of beam parameters (energy, current, radius, pulse length, emittance, and
energy spread) such that the beam can reach the target without being destroyed by
the possible instabilities. This is rather difﬁcult, especially because the existing
theoretical models predict stable beam propagation in such a narrow range of
conﬂicting parameters that only the actual testing of a beam will conﬁrm whether
these predictions were correct or not.

The stability of beam-plasma systems is investigated by the standard perturba-
tion method. If the initial perturbation of a stationary state of the system increases
with time, the state is unstable under a perturbation of this type. Usually one seeks
a solution of the system in the form

f (~r, t) = f (~r) exp i(ωt

~k

~r)

−

·

where f is the deviation of any physical quantity from its stationary value. The
relation between the complex frequency ω and the complex wave number ~k is by
deﬁnition the dispersion relation

(6.1)

(6.2)

D(ω, ~k) = 0 .

35

A wave is said to be unstable, if for some real wave number k, a complex ω with
a negative imaginary part is obtained from the dispersion relations, signifying
growth in time of a spatially periodic disturbance:

Im(k) = 0
Im(ω) < 0

Instabilities in a beam-plasma system are primarily the result of the interaction
between the beam and the plasma. The main parameters characterizing the plasma
are its so-called plasma frequency (or Langmuir frequency) ωp and ν the collision
frequency of the plasma electrons. The plasma frequency is

where ne is the electron number density and me the electron mass. The plasma
dielectric constant is then

Similarly, as a plasma on its own, the beam is also characterized by its beam

where nb is the beam particle number density, m the beam particles rest mass and
γ their Lorentz factor. The on-axis beam-plasma frequency is related to the beam
scale radius by (4.2), and therefore

(6.10)

There are numerous kinds of instabilities and many methods of classifying
them. A rough phenomenological way is to divide them into two categories:
macroscopic and microscopic. The next step is then to distinguish between var-
ious characteristics, such as the fate of the perturbation (absolute or convective),
the driving forces (electrostatic, electromagnetic, etc.), the relative importance
of collisions (collisional/non-collisional, resistive/ non-resistive), the relative im-
portance of spread in the velocity distributions or temperatures (hydrodynamic,
kinetic), etc. There is no sharp distinction between different possible categories.
In this paragraph we will simply introduce the main concepts involved.

Macroscopic instabilities inﬂuence the spatial distribution of the beam. They
are usually classiﬁed according to the geometry of the distorsion. For beams there
are four main categories: (i) the sausage mode in which the beam contracts ar
regular intervals; (ii) the hose or kink mode in which the beam oscillate sideways;
(iii) the ﬁlamentation mode in which the beam breaks up into several ﬁlaments;
and (iv) the ripple mode in which the beam is distorted by small-scale ripples on
the surface. Macroinstabilities concern also other macroscopic degrees of freedom
such as densities, hydrodynamic velocities, etc. They are connected with the ﬂow-
out of a plasma as a whole from one region into another. Macroscopic instabilities
are also called magnetohydrodynamic, hydrodynamic, or simply low frequency
instabilities.

Microscopic instabilities do not necessarily induce a macroscopic motion of
the plasma as a whole, but they can excite local ﬂuctuations of density and electro-
magnetic ﬁelds in the plasma. These velocity-space modes which do not appear to
have direct effect on the beam will principally appear as an extra form of energy
loss by which the energy of the beam can be transformed into powerful electro-
magnetic radiations. The most important kind of microinstability is the so-called
two-stream instability. This mode is found when one is studying the propagation
of electromagnetic waves in a system consisting of two interpenetrating streams
of particles.

Some kinds of microinstabilities are directly connected to macroinstabilities.
This is the case, for example, of ﬁlamentation which can be the macroscopic
stage of a purely growing transverse electrostatic microinstability (the Weibel
instability). In general, the growth of microinstabilities may lead to the onset of
macroinstabilities, which may eventually destroy the beam.

In a given reference frame, two types of instabilities can be distinguished

37

physically: convective instabilities, and absolute or non-convective instabilities
[42]. Brieﬂy stated, the essential point is the distinction as to whether an initially
localized disturbance (on an inﬁnite system) grows exponentially with time lo-
cally (absolute instability) or ultimately decays because of the propagation of the
growing disturbance away from the point of origin (convective instability). For a
beam propagating along the z axis, the group velocity of an unstable perturbation
with longitudinal wave number kz is given by

vg =

Re(ω) .

∂
∂kz

(6.11)

If vg = v the beam velocity, the perturbation is absolute in the beam frame; if
vg = 0, the perturbation is absolute in the plasma; and if vg < v, the perturbation is
convective. Clearly, for beam propagation, the worse instabilities are the absolute
ones in the beam frame. Therefore, if an instability cannot be avoided, it should
at least be convective in order not to completely hinder propagation.

The effect on stability of beam particle collisions with the plasma can in general
be neglected except when, as with bremsstrahlung losses of high energy electron
beams, they contribute in broadening the beam velocity distribution.

→

The collisions of the plasma electrons with the plasma molecules and ions often
have an important effect on stability, and they can either increase or decrease the
growth rates. When collisions are negligible, the instabilities are in the collisionless
regime (ν
0). In the collisional regime several distinctions can be made, in
particular depending upon the relative values of the magnetic diffusion time τm
and the collision frequency ν [43]. For high-current beams propagating in air,
one has τmν < 1 for pressures below a few Torr, and the instabilities are called
non-resistive. For pressure above a few Torr τmν > 1, and the instabilities are of
the resistive kind. In the former case, the key parameter is the dielectric constant
(6.6) and various time scale are possible for the growth rate, in the resistive case the
time-scale is τm. When τe > τm, the acting forces are predominantly electrostatic,
whereas, in the resistive domain where τm > τe, they are primarily magnetic.

In describing the electromagnetic oscillations associated with instabilities,
especially in the case of microinstabilities, one often uses the standard conventions
used for electromagnetic wave propagation in wave guides or plasmas. If ~E0 and
~B0 are the unperturbed ﬁelds, and ~E1 and ~B1, their respective perturbations, one
uses the following terminology:

The hydrodynamic description of a beam-plasma system is strictly valid only
in the limit of a monoenergetic beam penetrating a cold plasma. The velocity
distribution of the beam (also called the beam temperature), and/or the velocity
distributions of the plasma (the plasma ion and electron temperatures) can be taken
into account by kinetic plasma theory. Neglecting the plasma temperature effects,
the hydrodynamic regime of instability, as opposed to the kinetic regime, is deﬁned
by the following condition

The combination of the effects of collisions with those of velocity spreads
can considerably diminish the growth rate of instabilities. However, the most
serious instabilities cannot completely be suppressed. Their effect will thus have
to be minimized by the proper choice of beam parameters like current, shape,
pulse length, deliberate velocity spreads, etc. In the following sections the major
instabilities will be discussed together with possibles remedies.

39

6.2 Microinstabilities

When a beam passes at high velocity through a plasma, its coupling to the electrons
or ions can excite unstable electromagnetic oscillations. For high energy beams
propagating in ionized air, the coupling to the ions is in general negligible relative
to to the coupling to the electrons. The resulting microinstabilities are of several
different kinds depending upon the type of electromagnetic wave excited. The
two most important ones are the so-called two-stream instability, which refers
to transverse or longitudinal electrostatic waves, and the Weibel instability (or
ﬁlamentation) which is a transverse electromagnetic mode.

The complete analysis of the various types of streaming instabilities is rather
complicated because the beam velocity distributions, the plasma temperatures,
the beam’s own magnetic ﬁeld, etc, all have an effect on them. The theoretical
analysis by analytical models is thus restricted to the most simple cases for which
a linear perturbation approach is possible. The full analysis, including non-linear
effects, requires computer simulations and experiments will be needed to check
the validity of the codes [22, 23]. The following discussion will present the main
known results for the above-mentioned instabilities in the case of high energy
beams launched into the air in the pressure range of interest for particle beam
weapons.

6.2.1 Two-stream instability

The dispersion relation of the two-stream instability of a monoenergetic beam
interacting with a cool plasma, neglecting he beam’s own magnetic ﬁeld, is [45]

The unstable waves which are solutions to this dispersion relation are obtained by
resolving it for ω and ﬁnding he roots which have a negative imaginary part. The
peak growth occurs at kkkkv = ωp and for ν > ωp it is given by

δ = Im(ω) =

(γ2 sin2 φ + cos2 φ) .

(6.19)

At relativistic energies, the fastest growing oscillations are those propagating

almost perpendicular to the beam (sin φ

due to the fact that when γ

to transverse waves for which

ia a major obstacle to the propagation of monoenergetic beams over signiﬁcant
distances. However, taking the self-ﬁelds of the beam into account, the two-stream
instability can be totally suppressed, provided the parameters fall into the kinetic
regime. The kinetic theory dispersion relation replacing (6.17) in the case of
transverse waves takes the form [42]

The integral over the beam velocity distribution f(v) has a singularity for ω = kv,

waves in warm plasmas (Landau damping effect). In the case of the two-stream
instability, a similar effect is associated with the beam velocity distribution and re-
sults in the suppression of the instability [45]. This suppression becomes effective
in the kinetic domain, which for two-stream instabilities sets in when

The simple stability criterion predicts that the two-stream instability will be
suppressed for high-current high energy beams propagating in air at pressures
above a few Torr. This has been veriﬁed experimentally [47, 48] and has been
conﬁrmed by extensive computer calculations for beam energies up to 1 GeV and
currents of the order of 10–100 kA [49].

Below the critical pressure related to the collision frequency bound (6.25),
the two-stream instability is not suppressed, but its growth rate is considerably
reduced by kinetic effects. The growth rates of the longitudinal and transverse
electrostatic waves, respectively, are then [44, 50]

6.2.2 Weibel (or micro-ﬁlamentation) instability

The electromagnetic modes with ~k normal to ~v, ~E nearly parallel to ~v, and ~B
normal to both ~v and ~E is a variety of the Weibel instability. This instability grows
fastest in the absence of external or self-generated magnetic ﬁelds and is thus
1. It is an absolute instability which grows at perturbation
maximum for fm ≈
centers of enhanced beam density which magnetically attract nearby beam particles
and repel plasma electrons. Thus, the beam ultimately splits into ﬁlaments, each
of which self-pinches. The computer simulations of this process [51] show that
the ﬁlamentation stage in which the effect of this microinstability reaches the
macroscopic level, eventually ends up with the beam breaking up into separate
ﬁlaments, which may recombine into a single dense beam, from which the return
current is expelled.

For a charge- and current-neutralized beam, in which the self-ﬁelds are nearly
suppressed, the dispersion relation of the Weibel instability for low frequencies
(ω < ωp ) is [51]

the growth of this instability is reduced, but kinetic effects alone are not sufﬁcient

is no such effect as Landau damping in that case. The kinetic regime boundary

From (6.8) and (6.15) the maximum e-fold time in the kinetic regime is ﬁnally

(When fm = 1 the kinetic effects are absent and (6.29) applies.) The e-fold time

published analysis on the full effect of the self-ﬁelds. However, the criterion
(6.32) is likely to still be applicable. This is, as is conﬁrmed by recent theoretical
work [54], because this mode is always stable when the magnetic ﬁeld B gives
a beam particle cyclotron frequency Ωc = qB/γm larger than βωb, and that the
self-magnetic ﬁeld is equivalent to Ωc = √2βωb [53].

6.2.3 Discussion of microinstabilities

Concerning the stability of a beam with respect to microinstabilies, the situation
can now be summarized as follows:

At very low gas pressure, the plasma generated by the beam can be so
week that the beam is only partially charge neutralized (fe < 1), and the
In that case, when 1 > fe > 1/γ2,
conductivity so low that fm ≈
the beam is pinched but the plasma electron density may be insufﬁcient
for microinstabilities to develop. With electron beams, the two-stream
instability is avoided as long as the product of gas pressure and pulse length
is low enough to keep secondary electrons from accumulating inside the
beam [55]. This is sometimes referred to as the low pressure propagation
window. For air, it corresponds to about 10−6 Torr for a 10 kA beam [21, 55].
For such a beam, with an energy of 500 MeV, the range would be of the
order of 200 km [55].

At intermediate pressures, the two-stream mode sets in, and the beam be-
comes unstable. The range of the beams is then determined by the maximum
growth rate given by (6.26) or (6.27).

At pressures above a few Torr for beam currents in the 10–100 kA range,
the two-stream instability is suppressed. This has been observed in many
experiments — for a review see [12] and for recent experiments [22, 47].
However, above the critical pressure, the rise in plasma conductivity enables
1.
a return current to ﬂow and ﬁlamentation becomes possible as fm →
Moreover, because of this increase in conductivity, other new instabilities,
including macroinstabilities, also become possible. Therefore, the narrow
stability window observed in air near 1 Torr is due to the suppression of
microinstabilities by collisions and kinetic effects, and to the temporary
absence of resistive macroinstabilities which set in at higher pressures.

6.3 Macroinstabilities

The small amplitude distorsion of the shape of a cylindrical beam can be described
by giving the perturbed form of the beam surface:

r = a + ∆r(z, r, θ, t) .

(6.33)

The standard method is to make a multipole expansion of the perturbation in a thin
annulus as a function of the azimuthal angle θ

∆r =

∆rm(z, r, t) cos mθ .

(6.34)

superposition of modes such that [56]

(6.35)

m

The mode m = 0 displays harmonic variations of beam radius with distance along
the beam axis: this is sausage instability. The mode m = 1 represents transverse
displacements of the beam cross-section without change in the form or in a beam
characteristics other than the position of its center of mass: this is called sinuous,
kink or hose instability. Higher values of m represent changes of cross-section
from circular form: m = 2 gives an elliptic cross-section, m = 3 a pyriform cross-
section, etc. Modes with m > 1 are referred to as ﬁlamentation modes, because
their growth leads towards the break-up of the beam into separate ﬁlaments.

For a given azimuthal wave number m, various radial modes are possible. They
are usually classiﬁed according to the degree 2n of polynomial eigenfunctions of
the dispersion equation. For example, when m = 0, n = 0 corresponds to axial
hollowing, n = 1 to standard sausaging, n = 2 to axial bunching, etc [57]. A
systematic classiﬁcation of the modes excited by resistive macroinstabilities in a
simpliﬁed helical orbit beam model has been given by Weinberg [58].

The primary concern with macroinstabilities is to determine their growth rate
and the conditions for which they are sufﬁciently convective to insure that the
growth will be of limited consequence for a sufﬁciently short beam pulse. The
analysis is then simpler in the Doppler shifted frequency representation of the
oscillations:

exp i(kz

ωt) := exp i(Ωz/v

ωτ )

(6.36)

−

−

In this representation, τ gives the position of a section of the beam pulse measured
from the head of the beam (5.1), and Ω is the Doppler-shifted frequency (6.13).

When Ω is real, and ω complex, the dispersion relation D(Ω, ω) = 0 yields
solutions giving the free growth of instabilities corresponding to initial value
problems in the beam frame. These are potential instabilities developing during
the ﬂight of the beam towards its target. It is thus crucial that these instabilities
are convective, i.e., Re ω(Ω)

= 0.

When ω is real, and Ω complex, the same dispersion relation yields solutions
to initial value problems in the accelerator frame. The convective nature of
the instabilities or the limited duration for the acceleration period for absolute
instabilities, will ensure that their effect will disappear after the pulse has left
the accelerator. For practical reasons one usually studys macroinstabilities in
laboratory experiments by deliberately introducing perturbations at the end of

45

6
the acceleration process [59]. In the following discussion, we will assume that
the accelerator can be built in such a way that the pulse is not disturbed during
acceleration. We will thus concentrate on instabilities affecting the ﬂight of the
beam towards its target.

6.3.1 Electrostatic kink instability

The analysis of the major macroinstabilities for propagation in air at pressure
between 0.01 and 1 atmosphere, will show that only short pulses may propagate
over sizable distances. Furthermore, because of the considerable difference in
relativistic mass between transverse and longitudinal motions of the beam, insta-
bilities involving transverse displacement wil grow fastest. As a result, the ﬁrst
order description of a beam pulse during the early stages of the growth of an
instability, will not be that of a thin and ﬂexible thread but of an axially rigid rod,
the cross-section of which is undergoing distorsion. This is the so-called rigid
beam approach.

However, in the case of a beam propagating in a vacuum or a low density
plasma, the thin thread approximation can be satisfactory. Let us consider, for
example, the stability of a charged beam in a vacuum, and then the effects of
In that case, the most serious instability is the m = 1

electromagnetic kink mode in which the beam is distorted as a ﬂat snake or a
screw. The growth rate can be determined by analysing the lateral motion of a
ﬂexible cylinder of charged particles in a vacuum. The calculation is easiest in the
beam frame, and after Lorentz transformation into the accelerator frame the result
is

(6.37)

Because of the ﬁnite radius of the beam, the growth rate δ =
Im(Ω)
for k = kkkk real, has a maximum at ka = 0.6γ , and a cut-off at ka = γ. In the
rest frame of the beam, the effect of a plasma environment is to reduce the electric
ﬁeld by a factor equal to the dielectric constant (6.6) : hence to reduce the growth
rate by 1/√ǫp . When ν > kv, (6.37) then becomes

This is the dispersion relation of the electrostatic kink instability in the hydrody-

in air at pressures below 1 Torr. The maximum growth rate is at ka = 0.72γ :

Let us consider now the stability problem of a rigid beam subject to transverse
displacements. This is the m = 1 mode and it is easiest to start by considering ﬁrst
a beam with a constant density proﬁle and a sharp boundary, even though we will
have to examine later the more realistic case of a beam with the Bennett proﬁle.
We further assume that the beam is fully charge neutralized by a collisional plasma
of constant density with radius larger than the beams radius.

If a beam is slightly displaced in the transverse direction, a surface charge
density distribution with a cos θ azimuthal dependence will appear. Such a charge
distribution produces an homogeneous dipolar electric ﬁeld which results in an
electrostatic restoring force directly proportional to the displacement. For a beam
with a ﬂat density proﬁle, the equation of motion is simply [61]

6.3.2 Electromagnetic kink (or “hose”) instability

2ω2

In a low conductivity plasma, τe is very large and (6.43) reduces to stable os-
cillations at frequency Ω2 = 1
b . Physically, thy, this corresponds toa beam
neutralized by inﬁnitely heavy ions, so that the beam’s motion is simple harmonic
oscillations about a cylinder of neutralizing charges which cannot move. This is
obvious from (6.42) which shows that when τe =
, yp is constant. At the other
limit of high conductivity τe becomes very small. In that case (6.42) indicates
that yb = yp, and this corresponds to the fact that when conductivity is very high,
the plasma neutralizing the beam can follow it exactly, and there are no electro-
static beam oscillations or instabilities. However, when the conductivity is high,
magnetic forces have to be taken into account:

When a beam is displaced transversely to its direction of propagation, the mo-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the beam current JB induces a longitudinal

and ~Bθ the azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld, the Lorentz transformation of this magnetic
~Bθ in the limit of small ~vy. This electric ﬁeld generates a
ﬁeld gives ~Ez = ~vy ×
longitudinal plasma current ~Jz = σ ~Ez, which, if the plasma conductivity is high
enough, generates an azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld of sufﬁcient strength to interfere
with the beam current generated azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld. (This plasma current
should not be confused with the plasma return current, which we assume to be
negligible for the moment, fm = 0.) As the displacement of the plasma does not
coincide with that of the beam when the conductivity is ﬁnite, the total magnetic
ﬁeld resulting from JB and Jz will have an axis ym different from the beam axis
yb or the plasma current axis yp. This displacement of this magnetic ﬁeld axis is
directly related to the magnetic diffusion time. Thus

(6.46)

When the conductivity is low (i.e., τm small) the plasma induced by the lateral
displacement is negligible and ym = yb, the magnetic axis always corresponds

48

to the beam axis. On the contrary, when the conductivity is high (i.e., τm large),
or the plasma inﬁnite in extent (i.e.,
), ym is constant and the magnetic
ﬁeld is “frozen.” When the magnetic ﬁeld axis does not correspond with the beam
axis, the particles in the beam are subjected to a restoring magnetic force which
is equivalent to the force needed to drive the plasma current Jz. This force can
be determined from the effect on the beam of the dipolar magnetic ﬁeld resulting
from the differences in position between the beam and the magnetic ﬁeld axis.
This gives

The dispersion relation (6.48) is similar to its electrostatic counter part (6.43),
but corresponds to a different driving mechanism. In fact, for τm < τe, the kink
instability is of the electric kind and the dispersion relation is (6.43). On the other
hand, in high conductivity plasmas τm > τe and the instability is of the magnetic
kind and the dispersion relation is (6.48). In the limit of τm ≈

6.3.3 Macrostability of a beam penetrating a neutral gas

In the case of a beam penetrating a neutral gas and generating it own plasma, the
electric and magnetic kink modes are encountered successively as the conductivity
rises from zero to a maximum. A model valid for arbitrary conductivity and
combining the two instabilities is thus important. Such a model is obtained by
combining (6.41), (6.42), (6.46), and (6.47):

As the m = 1 oscillations are stable in the limits σ = 0 and σ =

growth rate has a maximum at some ﬁnite value of the conductivity. The dispersion

By comparison with (5.9) and (5.12), one sees that this happens at a point very
early in the beam pulse, and that m = 1 instabilities will have maximum growth
in the neck region.

In the head region of the beam, τe and τm are direct functions of the beam
current (5.9). Therefore, in order to minimize the length of the neck region over
which the growth is largest, the conductivity generation by the beam should be as
large as possible, requiring

IB > IG .

(6.54)

However, this condition implies high plasma return currents: the hose instability
should therefore be examined in the fm 6

= 0 case as well.

A non-zero plasma return current has essentially no effect on the electrostatic
forces, and thus on the electric kink instability. On the other hand, the magnetic
forces are directly affected, and the ﬁrst effect of a return current is to diminish the
magnetic force in (6.47) by the factor (1
fm) which is equivalent to replacing
the current IB used to calculate ω2
b with (6.8) by IE. But there is also an additional
effect: as anti-parallel currents tend to repel each other, when the beam is displaced
relative to the plasma channel in which the return current ﬂows, the interaction
between the beam current and the return current tends to increase the displacement.
This is the so-called self-hose effect which results in a supplementary force on the
beam proportional to IBIP = fmI 2
B. Including those two effects, the equation of
motion (6.47) becomes

With the effect of the self-hose included, the growth rate of the magnetic hose
instability is clearly worse.
In particular contrary to (6.48), the growth rate at
= 0, even a very slow
Ω = 0 is now non-zero. This implies that when fm 6
transverse displacement may result in the disruption of the beam. Furthermore, as
fm tends towards one, the growth rate increases and the position of the pole moves
towards smaller frequencies.

The electric and magnetic hose modes for rigid oscillations of ﬂat proﬁle
cylindrical beams show very bad stability properties. The consequences of various
damping effects on these instabilities will be discussed below. Before that, we
will examine the m
= 1 modes with the same ﬂat proﬁle rigid beam model, but
only for resistive modes in the limit of τm > τe.

For m = 0, the sausage mode dispersion relation is as follows [57, 70]

The main difference between this dispersion relation and the hose dispersion
relation (6.56) is that the sausage mode is unstable in a limited frequency range
0, between ωb and 2ωb. This will enable the kinetic effects to
only: for fm ≈
stabilize this instability provided that, as can be seen from (6.57),

For m > 1, there are numerous unstable modes possible. However, in the limit

of small fm, the main modes obey the approximate dispertion relation [58]

In the case m = 1 one recognizes the hose mode, and for m > 1, similarly to the
sausage mode, instabilities exist only in a limited frequency range, which becomes
narrower in proportion when m2 increases.

The essential difference between the hose mode and the m

= 1 modes is
that when m = 1 a low frequency disturbance can be produced without internal
compression or distorsion: only a simple transverse displacement is required

fm < 1

[58, 64]. Because there is no change in internal pressure to produce a restoring
force, hose instability appears at an arbitrary low (Doppler shifted) frequency.
Furthermore, the stabilizing effects of possible spreads in the beam velocities
= 1 modes, instability potentially appears at ﬁnite
vanish in that limit. For the m
frequency, but is strongly suppressed by kinetic effects. We will thus concentrate
on these effects on the hose mode only, assuming that coping with this worst case
mode will be sufﬁcient.

6.3.4 Macrostability of beams with rounded radial proﬁles

In examining now the stability of more realistic beam plasma models we will see
that the instabilities are somehow not so bad as for idealized models such as the
sharp boundary, ﬂat proﬁle, cylindrical beam studied so far. We will ﬁrst look at
the effect of rounded beam proﬁles — speciﬁcally of the Bennett proﬁle (4.16) —
and then at the effect of spreads in velocity distribution, mainly arising from the
particle’s oscillations in the pinch ﬁeld.

Let us rewrite the hose dispersion relation for fm = 0 in the following form

In comparison with (6.60), this dispersion relation shows much less serious insta-

(6.69)

•

The instability, from absolute in the beam frame, becomes convective.
Therefore, as a perturbation of the beam grows, it will at the same time
move backwards into the pulse. For a perturbation of amplitude y(0) gen-
erated at the head of the beam, a saddle point analysis of the dispersion

53

relation [64] shows that the growth of the hose is such that at the tail of the
beam pulse its amplitude will be

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

The existence of a maximum and of a cut-off in (6.68) have been veriﬁed
experimentally [59]. Similarly, other experiments [47] have also demonstrated the
convective nature of the hose instability. In these experiments, the hose instability
leads to an erosion of the beam tail. This is because, for a beam of ﬁnite duration,
the disturbance is maximum at the end of the pulse.

The signiﬁcance of (6.70) is that for a pulse of ﬁnite duration, a disturbance
ultimately disappears. Thus, if a beam pulse has a duration of the order of τd, it
will be able to propagate over large distances. In practice, the problem is that τd
is only of a few nanoseconds for a high current beam injected into the atmosphere
at normal pressures. Therefore, stable beam propagation is restricted to very short
pulses.

A further difﬁculty with the hose instability is that its maximum growth and
its convective nature depend on the extend of current neutralization of the beam.
It is found, for instance, that even a small amount of current neutralization (i.e.,
0.1) is strongly destabilizing, particularly at low frequences, and leads to
fm ≈
absolute instability as seen by the beam [65]. The hose instability in the presence
of current neutralization has been studied in the frame work of he Vlasov theory
[68]. The results show that for a current neutralization fraction larger than 0.5 the
return current driven self-hose becomes the dominant destabilizing mechanism.

The general properties of the hose instability can be transposed to the case of
= 1 macroinstabilities and this has been veriﬁed in a number of cases. For

the m
example, it has been found that the sausage mode is stable provided that [68]

Similarly, general considerations show that ﬁlamentation can be avoided if [71]

cases, these requirements may be somewhat less stringent. For instance, the
effect of various damping factors (such as variations of beam current during the
pulse, energy spreads, smooth radial and longitudinal beam proﬁles, ﬁnite pulse
length, etc [21]) cannot be calculated easily. Experiments such as those that
will be possible with the high-current high-energy accelerators which are under
construction in Los Alamos [22], Livermore [23] and in the Soviet Union [72] are
thus crucial.

Finally, because of the need for short pulses, actual beam weapon systems
will have to use trains of small pulses in order to send sufﬁcient energy towards
the target. This creates various problems, because pulses within a train will have
to propagate in the plasma background generated by the previous pulses. The
analysis of these problems, together with that of the boring of reduced density
plasma channels, will be part of the conceptual design of practical particle beam
weapons.

Discussion of theoretical prospect

We have examined the main physical problems involved in the propagation of
particle beams for possible exo-atmospheric or endo-atmospheric beam weapon
systems.

There is no problem of principle with the propagation of neutral particle
beam in outer space. Systems with adequate characteristics are currently in the
development stage [9]. For short range exo-atmospheric systems, i.e., of the
order of a few hundreds of kilometers, charged beams or plasmo¨id beams might
eventually be used.

For land-based systems, the main problem arises because of the conﬂicting

nature of the following set of conditions:

1. The beam power has to be larger than the Nordsieck power (4.22) in order

for the beam to propagate over sizable distances;

2. the beam current should be less than the critical current (5.8), and the current
neutralization fraction as small as possible (5.15), so that the beam is well
pinched;

3. the beam pulses have to be long enough so that they will not be completely
eroded before reaching their target (5.22). Furthermore, the beam should
be relativistic enough (γ > 10) for the steady state erosion hypothesis to be
valid;

4. the pulse duration has to be of the order of the dipole magnetic diffusion

time so that propagation is not disrupted by macroinstabilities (6.70);

56

5. in order to keep the growth of instabilities at a minimum, the current neu-
tralization should be minimized (6.32), (6.56), (6.58), (6.71), and (6.72) and
the conductivity should rise fast enough to avoid excessive growth in the
head (6.54);

6. the beam radius, emittance, energy and current should match the Bennett
pinch radius (4.12) and should be compatible with the requirements of beam
stability and hole boring.

These conditions cannot easily be simultaneously satisﬁed. This is primarily
because the pulse length is set by magnetic diffusion time. For a given beam
radius, this time can only be increased by increasing the beam current, and thus
producing an undesirable large current-neutralization fraction.

However, within rather tight limits, a set of acceptable beam parameters seems
to exist. In order to ﬁnd out if these conditions are really satisfactory for beam
weapon applications, careful experiments are needed. This concluding sentence
was written in November 1982, together with the addition al remark: These
crucial experiments will be done with accelerators currently under construction
in the United States [22, 23] and probably in the USSR [72]. Within a couple
of years, at most, the ﬁnal answer should be known. What can we add to this
conclusion, more then twenty years after it was written?

•

First: That the laws of physics have not changed, and that the theoretical
analysis done in previous chapters remains valid. In fact, having followed
the literature over the past twenty years, it appears that nothing really new
and important has been found and published. In particular, the most difﬁcult
theoretical problems addressed in this report — the questions related to of
the stability of propagating a charged-particle beam through a pre-existing
or beam-generated plasma — are still discussed in recent papers by referring
to the seminal work done during the 1960s to the 1980s.1 This is not to
say that no progress has been made, but that the basic physical processes at
work in high-intensity high-energy beam propagation in plasmas appear to
have been properly recognized and analysed during these decades.

•

Second: That a major step in the theoretical understanding of beam-propagation
stability was made between the early analyses, such a those of Steven Wein-
berg [58], and those of Edward P. Lee [64], which showed that oversimpliﬁed
models were likely to predict far too pessimistic behaviors in comparison

1See, for example, references number 20 to 25 cited in a recent paper where the resistive hose

instability is reinvestigated for low-collisional plasmas [73].

57

to more realistic ones. This means that an essential step after accelerating
a beam pulse is that of “conditioning,” that is of shaping and smoothing its
spatial an possibly temporal extent in such a way to avoid the onset and
growth of instabilities during propagation.2

•

Third: That technological advances are constantly changing the context in
which speciﬁc systems have to be assessed, both from a theoretical then
from an experimental point of view [74]. For example, the possibility of the
use of antihydrogen beams in exoatmospheric systems came to the author’s
mind in 1983 when a former CERN colleague told him about Los Alamos
management’s interest to hire him for antimatter work at their laboratory
[75]. This lead him to realize that antimatter was the sole portable source of
muons, which are the main byproducts of the annihilation of antiprotons with
matter [76]. This means that if muons from such a source could be “cooled”3
and accelerated, the possibility of exploiting the high-range of muons beams
(see Figures 4.2 and 4.3) would become theoretically possible. In fact, as
will be seen in Section 10.5, the problem of generating and cooling intense
beams of muons is the subject of vigorous research since a few years. While
this effort may not succeed in producing muon-beams sufﬁciently intense to
propagate in self-pinched mode over signiﬁcant distances, the development
of muon technology for fundamental research will help assessing whether
muon beams, and beams of their related neutrino decay products, may have
other practical applications [77, 78].

2This is the plasma-physical counterpart of the hydrodynamical need to smooth boundaries
and remove all unwanted discontinuities in order to avoid drag, turbulence, and instabilities in the
motion of ships, aircrafts, or missiles.

3“Cooling” means decreasing the kinetic energy dispersion of a bunch of particles.

Chapter 8

Discussion of beam propagation
experiments

The discussion of the experimental prospect of particle beam technology for exoat-
mospheric applications is quite different from that of endoatmospheric applica-
tions.1 Indeed:

•

Exoatmospheric beam technology is very similar to the relatively low-
intensity (mA), relatively high-energy (GeV), beam technology used in
numerous, ofﬁcially non-military, national and international nuclear and
elementary-particle research laboratories. Moreover, the typical accelerator
and beam steering technologies required for outer-space beam weapons is
very similar to those of emerging applications of accelerators such as cancer
therapy, breeding of ﬁssile and fusion materials, transmutation of nuclear
waste, breeding of antimatter [80], or proton-radiography of the detona-
tion of conventional explosives and nuclear weapon’s primaries, [81] and
[82, p.84–89], as well as to that of next-generation research accelerators
such as the Large hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and the future linear-
collider to be built (most probably in the US) as a fully international effort
[83]. This means that most components of space-based beam weapons can
be developed and tested in civilian laboratories (Section 9.1), and that the
role of military laboratories is to develop and test systems which integrate
these components, and merge them together with the application speciﬁc
technologies related to their use in an outer-space battle-ﬁeld environment,

1A summary of the early efforts on particle beam weapons research, from World War II to
1980, as well as some comments on Soviet particle beam research, are given in a comprehensive
fact-sheet published by the U.S. Department of Defense [79].

59

rather than as research tools in a laboratory (Section 9.2). Finally, most
experiments on exoatmospheric systems can be done on the ground, e.g.,
using evacuated pipes for propagating the beam, and without requiring safety
precautions which are dramatically more stringent than those required by
the operation of typical accelerators used for scientiﬁc research.

•

Endoatmospheric beam technology is very similar to the relatively high-
intensity (kA), relatively low-energy (MeV), beam technology used in mil-
itary laboratories for the ﬂash x-ray radiography of the detonation of con-
ventional explosives and nuclear weapon’s primaries [82, p.81–84], the
generation of high-power radio-frequency or free-electron-laser beams, and
the simulation of nuclear weapons effects [29], with only few civilian appli-
cations (such as industrial radiography, electron-beam welding, and possibly
future inertial conﬁnement fusion drivers and very high-energy particle ac-
celerators [129]). Therefore, the development and demonstration of this
technology is mostly done in military and national laboratories, as will be
seen in sections 10.1 to 10.4, — even though there is signiﬁcant overlap
between these developments and those of conventional research accelera-
tors, as is shown by the fact that both type of technologies are generally
discussed at the same national and international scientiﬁc conferences, and
published in the same technical journals. Finally, an additional reason for
locating these experiments in military laboratories is that even relatively
modest endoatmospheric systems create special hazards because the total
energy in typical beam pulses can easily be equivalent to the energy content
of gram- to kilogram-amounts of high-explosives.

The purpose of this report is to review the physics of high-intensity high-
energy particle beam propagation. The discussion of exoatmospheric systems
could therefore be very brief since (as noticed in section 3.1) there is in principle
no scientiﬁc obstacle to propagating a neutral beam over long distances in the
near-vacuum of outer-space. We will nevertheless address some of the critical
issues related to these systems, even though they are more of a technological
than physical nature. This is because the development of exoatmospheric beam
weapons is in many ways linked to those of endoatmospheric ones, and because
their development illustrates the very strong interdependence which characterizes
civilian and military particle accelerator research, as well as the importance of
informal international collaborations and scientiﬁc exchanges (including between
“enemies”) in relation to the development of advanced weapons systems.

9.1 Neutral particle beam technology development

·

×

10−7 m

According to section 3.1, what is required to focus a beam on a 1 m target at a
distance of 1000 km is a beam with an initial radius of 20 cm and an emittance
rad.1 As a charged particle is needed in order to be accelerated by
of 2
electromagnetic means, the general technique is to start from a negative-ion source
producing a low-energy, low-emittance beam of H− or D− atoms which is then
injected into an accelerator whose main quality is to increase the energy of the
ions to about 100 MeV without unduly increasing the emittance of the beam. At
the exit of the accelerator this high-brightness beam is very precisely focused on a
target by a magnetic beam-steering optics, and then passed through a neutralizing
cell in order to remove the extra electron (without increasing the beam emittance)
so that the ﬁnal beam is neutral.

Most of the basic technologies necessary for building such a system have been
invented, built, and tested between the late 1970s and the early 1990s. This is
what will be summarized in the next subsections:

1Chapter VII and VIII of the Los Alamos Accelerator Technology Division 1978 progress
report is describing a number of features associated with a system based on a 20–100 mA, 50–500
MeV beam with such an emittance [92, p.24-77].

61

9.1.1 The ion source.

The ﬁrst advance which made the concept of a neutral particle beam weapon
scientiﬁcally feasible was the invention of a sufﬁcient low-emittance negative
ion source by the group of V.G. Dudnikov in the USSR [84, 85]. This pulsed
surface-plasma ion source was quickly adopted world-wide, and Los Alamos
soon demonstrated its superior performances relative to conventional sources [86,
p.117], [87].

9.1.2 The injector.

The second major advance which made the concept of a neutral particle beam
weapon scientiﬁcally feasible was again a Soviet invention. It solved the problem
of injecting into a linear accelerator a low-energy low-emittance beam while main-
taining its brightness. It is so-called “radiofrequency quadrupole” (RFQ), which,
in combination with the Dudnikov high-brightness H− source, led to speculations
in the years 1978-1980 that the USSR might have had a considerable advance in
particle beam weapons technology. However, while development of RFQ tech-
nology started in Russia in 1970 already, it only reached maturity around 1977,
about the time when Los Alamos started its own RFQ programme [88].

In fact, it is in 1978 that a new Accelerator Technology Division (AT), headed
by Edward A. Knapp, was formed at Los Alamos. The ﬁrst step in the development
of a neutral particle beam system for possible deployment in space, code-named
“White Horse,” was to build a 5 MeV accelerator test stand, which could be
scaled up to about 50 MeV for outer-space re-entry-vehicle/decoy discrimination,
and later to about 500 MeV for boost-phase or mid-course intercept of ballistic
missiles. This accelerator test stand (ATS) was to integrate in a test-bed a Dudnikov
H− source, a RFQ to reach an energy of about 2 MeV, a drift-tube linear accelerator
section to increase the beam energy to 5 MeV, and beam diagnostic equipments.
This relatively small and low-cost system was to be supplemented by several
collaborative undertaking on related military or civilian projects. This is why
Los Alamos was glad to accept a proposal form CERN, reported in the 1980 AT
division progress report [86, p.36]:

“(CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland, has asked the AT division to coop-
erate in the design and construction of an RFQ linac. This linac would
replace the [...] injector [...] used with the “old” linac for the CERN
proton synchrotron.
[...] The plan is to carry out the mechanical
design and assemblies at CERN, and then send them to Los Alamos

62

for machining of the pole tips.”

The reason why CERN needed Los Alamos for building an RFQ is that the
precise machining of its pole tips required a computer-controlled milling-machine
of a type that was only available in a nuclear-weapons laboratory such as Los
Alamos. Reciprocally, Los Alamos needed CERN as it provided a test-bed for
coupling an advanced RFQ injector to a high-energy linac, which, moreover,
happened to be the most recent and advanced in the world at the time.

Therefore, while the ﬁrst successful high-power operation of a prototype RFQ
with beam was obtained in February 1980, the ﬁrst operational RFQ built at Los
Alamos was shipped to CERN and installed on its new linac, while the second to
become operational was installed on the Los Alamos ATS on November 16, 1982,
[89, p.53].

9.1.3 The accelerator.

A major achievement of the Los Alamos accelerator technology division has
been to reach, in 1979, a quantitative understanding of emittance growth in linear
accelerators [90], showing that there is a lower limit to the emittance of such accel-
erators [91]. This understanding had been made possible by numerous exchanges
between Los Alamos and many other institutions, including the CERN laboratory
in Geneva. As an example, we cite a few sentences of the section on emittance
growth of the 1978 Los Alamos accelerator technology division progress report
[92, p.63,64,71]:2

“The new 50-MeV injector linac of CERN is the latest of this type
proton linear accelerator to be commissioned in the world. [...] Pre-
liminary results from CERN during the early summer 1978, using
the ﬁrst tank at 10 MeV, indicated larger than anticipated emittance
growth. Knowing our urgent need for veriﬁcation of the design ap-
proach for the FMIT project, the CERN Linac Group graciously in-
vited our participation in the commissioning of the full machine. An
on-site collaboration afforded us the opportunity to reach a level of
understanding impossible to achieve at conferences or by letter. [...]
We very much appreciate the complete openness, candor, and hospi-
tality of the whole CERN linac group. Their willingness to let us use

of the design of an accelerator and a beam-steering system to be used in a particle beam weapon.

63

their raw data, before they had time to publish their results, was the
key that enabled us to answer our basic questions in the urgent time
scale imposed by current projects.”

9.1.4 The beam focusing and steering optics.

A major issue in a space-based neutral beam system is the ability to focus the beam
into an acceptably small spot at some distance, and to provide a steering capability
for aiming the beam. Using the ray-tracing computer programme TURTLE (a
typical particle beam optics development tool devised by a collaboration of ac-
celerator physicists from FNAL, SLAC, and CERN), the Los Alamos accelerator
group was able to show in 1978 that a 50-meter long system of bending magnets
and solenoids was able to focus 91% of the beam within the desired radius, starting
with an initial radius of 0.2 m and an emittance of 2
rad [92, p.52–62].
An optical system with similar characteristics was ultimately built and successfully
tested in 1990 at the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago.

9.1.5 The neutralizing cell.

The ﬁnal part of a neutral particle beam accelerator system, the neutralizing cell
in which the extra electron is detached from the accelerated ion to form a beam
of neutral atoms, is possibly the most controversial component of the whole
system. This is because simple techniques (such as passing the beam through
a foil or a gas to strip-off the extra electron) are likely to signiﬁcantly increase
the emittance of the beam and therefore to unduly decrease its brightness, at
least for the most demanding applications of outer-space weapon systems. The
most promising technique is therefore that of laser photodetachment, which is
potentially 100% efﬁcient rather than limited to about 55% as with collisional
processes. High efﬁciency in outer-space is very important since any degree
of incomplete neutralization of the beam could result in charging the orbiting
accelerator, ultimately causing arcs that could lead to self-destruction. Moreover,
it could be that by means of a multiphoton detachment process the excess electron
could be removed without increasing beam emittance [93]. However, the kind of
laser required for this purpose would add a considerable level of complexity to
a space-based particle beam device, so that the whole subject of neutralization is
still an open issue, despite constant progress [94, 95].

64

9.1.6 Summary

The developments presented in this section clearly show that some kind of neutral
particle beam weapons can be built. Therefore, they established the scientiﬁc and
technical feasibility of such systems. However, they does not prove their practical
engineering feasibility, namely they do not demonstrate that a complete system
(including power supplies, cooling, and many ancillary systems) can be put in orbit
and operated in outer-space. This is where the speciﬁc developments described in
the next two sections come in.

9.2 BEAR and GTA at Los Alamos National Labo-

ratory

Until 1983 the development of neutral particle beam weapon’s technology and
systems was made in the form of small, relatively low-cost, and mostly “paper”
research programs. This was because (as shown in the previous section) the much
more costly civilian research programs related to fundamental research could be
used to develop and build all the key components of such systems, and that even
international laboratories such as CERN, located in a neutral non-nuclear-weapon
state, could be used for testing key component in full-scale accelerators.3

For this reason, the accelerator test stand (ATS), extensively referred to in the
previous section, was sufﬁcient to provide ﬁrst hand experience on the most crucial
components of a neutral particle beam system, and was even able to demonstrate
reliable operation at 170 mA and 5 MeV, making it the brightest high-current H−
beam in the world [98, p.3].

Nevertheless, with the advent of President Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initia-
tive, neutral particle beam weapons were to be evaluate in competition with other
directed-energy systems such as high-energy lasers and nuclear-pumped x-ray
lasers. This lead to the deﬁnition of a comprehensive, national neutral particle
beam research and development program lead by the Los Alamos laboratory, de-
scribed in a September-1986 brochure [98], and related technical reports [99].
The objectives of this program were: (i) to provide the necessary basis for a de-
cision by 1992 to build a space-based neutral particle beam system to be used as
a decoy/warhead discriminator (near term goal); (ii) to develop the technology

3The same will happened in the mid-1980s, and still continue today, with the development
of antimatter technology where U.S. scientists from weapons-laboratories have essentially free,
unlimited access to all of CERN’s antimatter facilities [80, 96, 97].

65

in stages to ultimately build a neutral particle beam weapon capable to provide a
rapid hard kill of enemy warheads (far term goal). To meet these objectives and
more directly the ﬁrst objective the essential elements of the program were:

1. The Integrated Space Experiment 1 (ISE-1) and
the Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket (BEAR);

2. The Ground Test Accelerator (GTA) and

the Technology Program.

The near-term goal was therefore to use the space shuttle to launch, in 1991, a
50-MeV-accelerator-based system into space (ISE-1), a quite ambitious objective.
This was to be preceded by the suborbital launch, in 1987, of a 1-MeV accelerator
by a single-stage Aries rocket. In this context, the GTA was to be representative of
what was actually to be placed into orbit in ISE-1, while the BEAR payload was
basically to be a ruggedized and less powerful version of the ATS, packed into a
cylindrical volume of 1 m diameter and 7 meter length, together with diagnostic
instrumentation.

However, as a consequence of the January 28, 1986 Challenger space shuttle
disaster and funding constraints, the Integrated Space Experiment (ISE-1) was
cancelled, and Los Alamos was asked in December 1987 to complete BEAR on
an accelerated schedule with limited funding [100, p.25]. The BEAR payload was
launched 200 km into space on July 13, 1989, and several accounts, e.g., reference
[100], as well as the ﬁnal report, i.e., reference [101], described the experiment as
a success:

“The US Department of Defense’s Strategic Defense Initiative Orga-
nization is sponsoring the development of neutral particle beam (NPB)
technology for strategic defense applications. The ﬁrst step in demon-
strating the functioning of an NPB in space was the development and
launch of the Beam Experiments Aboard a Rocket (BEAR) in New
Mexico in July 1989. A government, laboratory, and industrial team,
under the technical coordination of Los Alamos National Laboratory,
designed, developed, and tested the BEAR payload. The primary
objective of BEAR was the operation of an NPB accelerator in space.
The payload was also designed to study (1) the effects on the space ve-
hicle of emitting an NPB and associated charged beams into the space
environment; (2) the propagation and attenuation characteristics of
an NPB in space; (3) the dynamics of the charged particle compo-
nents of the beam in the geomagnetic ﬁeld; (4) the effects of neutral

66

efﬂuents from the vehicle; and (5) any anomalous or unanticipated
phenomena associated with operating an NPB in the space environ-
ment. The BEAR experiment successfully demonstrated operation of
an NPB accelerator and propagation of the neutral beam as predicted
in space, obtained ﬁrst-of-a-kind NPB physics data, and demonstrated
the ability of the BEAR accelerator to survive recovery and to continue
operating normally. No unanticipated phenomena were encountered
that would signiﬁcantly delay further development of NPB technology
for defensive, space-based weapon systems.” [101]

On the ground, despite the cancellation of the ﬁrst (and thus subsequent)
integrated space experiment(s), construction of the GTA proceeded more or less
on schedule, and the accelerator was commissioned in 1992, producing a 24-MeV,
50mA beam with a 2% duty factor [102]. Consistent with the design report, [99],
and other reports, e.g., [98, 103], work on GTA and related equipments, such
as the magnetic optics, proceeded in collaboration with numerous laboratories
and universities (e.g., the Oak Ridge, Lawrence Berkeley, and Argonne national
laboratories, the Northeastern University and the University of Texas) as well as
with the industrial contractors associated to the project. In particular, a state-of-
the-art RFQ was built at Los Alamos and delivered to serve as a proton source in
the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) expected to be built in Texas [103, 104].
Similarly, development and testing of the magnetic optics components were done
at the Argonne and Lawrence Berkeley laboratories.

However, although all its components had been built, and many of them suc-
cessfully tested, the GTA was never fully assembled, and its construction aban-
doned at the end of 1993 [104]. The ﬂoor space was later used for assembling and
testing the Low Energy Demonstration Accelerator (LEDA) of the Accelerator
Production of Tritium (APT) project [105], various equipments and spare parts
were reused in other projects, and ﬁnally the GTA accelerator itself was donated
in 2004 to the University of Indiana for its Low Energy Neutron Source (LENS)
facility, to be used as a training ground for scientists who will later work at the
$1.5 billion neutron source to be completed in 2006 at Oak Ridge [106]...

9.3 Emerging neutral beam technologies

As recalled in the previous section, the years immediately following the collapse of
the Soviet Union coincided with the abandonment of the most visible components
of the U.S. national neutral particle beam research and development program,

67

the ISE experiment and the GTA accelerator. Nevertheless, this did not mean
that interest in neutral particle beam was lost, neither that development stopped
there.
In particular, the numerous told and untold reasons for terminating an
attempt to demonstrate the viability of a neutral particle beam system in outer-
space were much more of a technical and political nature than of a fundamental
one. With a successful proof of principle experiment such as BEAR, there was no
really compelling scientiﬁc reason to make another space-based experiment which
would not have added very much to the understanding of the underlying physical
issues.
In fact, problems such as developing an appropriate kW to MW class
energy source for the whole system, a suitable cooling system for the accelerator,
or a highly efﬁcient beam neutralizer, would not have much beneﬁted from a
crash-program to put GTA into outer-space.

The points to be stressed are therefore:

1. That the accelerators and associated technologies for neutral beam weapon
systems are so closely related to those of accelerators and detectors used for
fundamental nuclear and elementary particle research that their development
does not need to be done in military laboratories. And:

2. That the speciﬁc characteristics of neutral particle beams for military appli-
cations such as ballistic missile defense should be discussed in relation to the
full range of technologies available for accomplishing similar decoy/weapon
discrimination and/or target destruction objectives [74].

Indeed, the most important and almost unique advantages of high-energy par-
ticles are their ability to penetrate deeply into any target and to interact strongly
(that is by inducing nuclear reactions) with any substance. This implies that the
potential damage can be considerable, and that even for very low-intensity beams
the secondary particles emitted in the nuclear interactions with the materials in the
targets provide a signal giving a lot of information on their composition. This is
illustrated by the current method which uses background cosmic-ray particles as
a natural beam for the remote analysis of the elemental composition of artiﬁcial
satellites [107]. While this method requires times on the order of months or years
to integrate sufﬁcient data to achieve useful data, directing a modest beam of ac-
celerated particles at a given spacecraft would achieve the same result in a fraction
of a second.4

4This requires, of course, the use of very sensitive and clever techniques for detecting the
secondary particles emitted by the target, and for discriminating them against the cosmic-ray
background, something that can only be compared to the skill required to design the detectors
and analyse the results of sophisticated high-sensitivity nuclear or elementary-particle physics
experiments.

68

Considering that it is most probably easier and less expensive to destroy a
ballistic missile or a spacecraft by means of some kind of a kinetic interceptor than
by either a high-energy laser or particle beam, the most potent application of a
space-based particle beam is quite certainly that of warhead/decoy discrimination.
This is possibly why this application had been assigned in priority to space-based
particle beam systems starting 1986 in the United States (see, e.g., references
[98] and [99], where it was suggested that a discriminator/weapon decision was
to be made by 1992). The remaining question to answer before designing and
possibly deploying such discriminators is therefore whether there could be any
strong competitor on the design horizon, of which two can easily be identiﬁed:

1. Antimatter beams. While a neutral hydrogen beam containing 5-10 MeV
protons would be sufﬁciently energetic to strongly react with the surface
of a target, a beam with an energy of at least 50–100 MeV is necessary to
penetrate inside, or to generate sufﬁciently many neutrons on the surface,
in order to determine whether there could be a nuclear warhead within. If
instead the beam would consists of low-energy antihydrogen atoms, the an-
tiprotons would spontaneously annihilate on the surface, generating several
high-energy pions for every antiproton hits, which would deeply penetrate
into the target and strongly interact with the materials. An antihydrogen
beam would therefore enormously simplify the design of the accelerator,
which could operate at a much lower beam energy and current than for
conventional hydrogen beam. Therefore, the technological burden would be
transferred to the antimatter technology, which, however, is under intensive
development since more that ten years [76].

2. Superlaser beams. Comparisons of the relative ability of neutral particle
beam and laser systems for discriminating between reentry vehicle and de-
coys show that particle beams can typically discriminate about hundred times
as many objects as can lasers, and do so with signiﬁcantly greater certainty
[108]. This applies, however, to lasers with relatively low peak power. The
recent invention of “chirped pulse ampliﬁcation,” which provided a factor of
one million increase in the instantaneous power of lasers, enabled tabletop
lasers to produce nuclear reactions directly [109]. Therefore, superlaser
beams combine the ease in steering and focusing of optical laser beams with
the capacity of particle beams to generate high-energy secondary particles
in distant targets, which gives them the ability to “x-ray” remote objects and
discriminate whether they are warheads or decoys [74].

One can therefore conclude that neutral particle beams provide a credible
option for discrimination, but that this option should be constantly compared to

69

emerging alternatives which arise as technology advances. In particular, it may
happen that the laser system required to neutralize a negative hydrogen beam
could in fact be of a complexity comparable to that of a superlaser able to do
the same discrimination task on its own... But it would then be necessary to
assess that further advances in antimatter technology would not require a complete
reevaluation of the possible military uses of antimatter, both in offensive and in
defensive weapons (see, [80, 96, 97, 76] and references therein).

Conversely, if some major scientiﬁc or technical advance is made in accelerator
technology, such as very-high-efﬁciency superconductive acceleration and radio-
frequency generation, very-high-brightness laser-acceleration of neutral-particles,
etc., neutral particle beams may ﬁnd again their leading position as a potential
rapid hard-kill system, simply because of the intrinsic strongly-interacting nature
of high-energy particles.5

5The abstract of a typical comparative study (possibly biased in favor of particle beams)
summarized this fact as follows: “This report explores the role of directed energy weapons
(DEWs) in theater defenses. For ranges shorter than 200–300 km they are much cheaper than
space-based interceptors (SBIs); they are competitive with ground-based interceptors (GBIs). For
1000 km, lasers are competitive with the SBIs, but NPBs are signiﬁcantly
inter-theater ranges of
cheaper than either. For nominal laser and space-based interceptor (SBI) costs, lasers are strongly
preferred for ranges under 300–500 km. For ranges 700 km, SBIs have a slight advantage. Neutral
particle beams (NPBs) appear dominant for ranges over 400–1000 km” [110].

Charged particle beam propagation
experiments

10.1 ATA at Lawrence Livermore National Labora-

tory

The purpose of the construction and operation of the Advanced Test Accelerator
facility (the ATA) at the LLNL, as well as its basic characteristics, have been
described in a number of informal, e.g., [111, 23, 112, 113], and more technical,
e.g., [114, 115, 116], papers and reports. Summarizing from these publications:

The main uncertainty in the concept of charge-particle beam weapons
is whether it is feasible to propagate an intense self-focused electron
beam through the atmosphere. That is, an electron beam held in tight
focus by its own magnetic ﬁeld. To conduct a comprehensive program
of electron-beam propagation experiments, LLNL has constructed
between 1978 and 1982 a 50 MeV, 10 kA, linear accelerator (the ATA)
at its high-explosive test location, Site 300, which is well equipped for
managing experiments with unusual hazards.

Together with its associated program of beam propagation physics,
the ATA represents the largest single component of the Defense Ad-
vanced Research Agency (DARPA) particle-beam technology pro-
gram, whose aim is to establish the feasibility of particle beam
weapons. The prime goal of the Department of Defense particle-
beam technology program is to resolve what is and is not possible in
beam propagation. Accordingly, the goal of the ATA is to develop an

71

experimental capability that can resolve critical questions about beam
propagation physics in a timely and cost-effective fashion.

A ﬁrst generation of particle-beam weapons will emphasize short-
range applications. Potentially ﬁrst applications of particle-beam
weapons may be for the defense of large ships against cruise mis-
siles. Another early use may be for terminal ballistic missile defense
of hardened sites such as missile silos or national command authority
centers. The short range, which reduces the sensor burden on search
and ﬁre-control radars, demands the high lethality that particle-beams
possess. Boring its way out to targets at a rate of a kilometer per
millisecond, the beam can deposit megajoule of energy almost instan-
taneously. Consistent with ﬁre-control system considerations, beam
weapons can have the capability of engaging tens of targets per second.
With such characteristics, charged-particle beams are particularly well
suited to counter small, very fast, highly maneuverable threats.

Photographs of the completed 200-meter-long ATA facility, as well
as drawings of the 80-meter-long underground experimental tank are
shown in reference [112]. Also visible is the 4-meter-thick shielded
door which can be moved aside for beam experiments in open air. For
such open air experiments the beam is directed towards a staging area
where it may interact with various targets after propagating in free air
over distances which are only limited by the topography of the ATA
site, located in a shallow valley at Site 300.

The main characteristics of the ATA in relation to his primary purpose, the
study of endoatmospheric beam propagation and interaction with military targets,
are as follows:

Beam energy : 50 MeV

•

An energy of 50 MeV means that that electron beam is fully relativistic but
still substantially below the 1’000 to 10’000 MeV required for propagating a
distance of one Nordsieck length in open air. This means that the experiments
at ATA will be done under rather difﬁcult conditions, which has the advantage
that the results will easily extrapolate to higher energies. In this respect, it
is important to recall the the main difﬁculties with particle acceleration is in
the low energy section: as soon as an electron beam has reached an energy
of 10-100 MeV it is easy to inject it into a betatron and further accelerate it
to higher energies. An example of such a betatron, designed to accelerate
the 10-kA ATA beam from 50 to 250 MeV, is given in reference [117].

Beam current : 10 kA

A current of 10 kA is on the order of the critical current given by equation
(x), which corresponds to the maximum current for self-pinched propagation
through the atmosphere a sea-level pressure.

Pulse length : 70 ns

A pulse length of 70 ns is adequate for studying nose erosion and tail losses
during propagation, as well as the convective nature of major instabilities
such the hose instability.

Burst rate : 1 kHz — Average rate : 5 Hz

A maximum repetition rate of 1’000 Herz, and an average rate of 5 Herz,
imply that every second ﬁve successive pulses separated by a time-delay
between 1 and 200 milliseconds can be sent into the experimental tank or
into the atmosphere. This enables to study hole boring and stability of
subsequent pulses through the low-density plasma generate by preceding
pulses in reduced-density or ground-level air.

Lethality : 35 kJ/pulse

The is only 3.5 percent of the 1 MJ energy which would be delivered by a
100 ns, 10 kA, 1 GeV beam pulse, i.e., the energy equivalent of about 0.25
kg of TNT, which is considered to be on the order necessary to destroy a
typical target. Nevertheless, this is sufﬁcient to test the lethality of the beam
on numerous targets without completely destroying them and the sensors
used in the measurements.

The accelerating principle used in the ATA is magnetic induction, a technology
traditionally used in circular accelerators such as the betatron, which was pioneered
and developed for use in linear accelerators at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory by N.C. Christoﬁlos [118].

The construction of the ATA started in 1980. The ﬁrst tests of the electron
gun (injector) began in November of 1982, and its full 10 kA, 2.5 MeV, beam was
delivered to the ATA main accelerator in January 1983.

The ATA started operating at its full design speciﬁcations of 10 kA and 50
MeV in July 1984. However, the beam current was was found to be strictly limited
by instabilities within the accelerator so that only very uniform beam pulses could
be accelerated to full energy when injected into the 85-m-long main accelerator
structure.

73

The most serious such instability, termed beam break-up (BBU), is a very
rapid growth of any beam’s transverse displacement to a disruptive amplitude. A
radical cure to this problem was found and tested in the early 1985 using another
lower-energy induction accelerator, the Experimental Test Accelerator (ETA),
[119, 120]. The idea was to ﬁll the accelerator with benzene gas at a pressure
of 10−2 Pa, corresponding to an altitude of 80 to 120 kilometer above the Earth,
and to created a plasma channel by sending a low-energy laser pulse through it.
This proved to be very successful, the channel providing an electrostatic guide for
the beam all the way through the accelerator [121]. Moreover, this breakthrough
provided a way to greatly simplify the construction, and to reduce the weight, of
future linear induction accelerator. Indeed, quoting from an October 1985 review
of the ATA progress:

“Clearly, the laser guiding technology gives a tremendous improve-
ment in accelerator performances as well as simpliﬁes accelerator
operator and future construction (i.e., no longer needed are transport
solenoid or steering magnets)” [122, p.3145].

The ﬁnal conﬁrmation of the full and reliable operation of ATA by the use of the
laser guiding transport technique was given on September 1986, [123, 124]. From
then on the ATA could be used for what he had been built for: To investigate the
feasibility of an intense charge-particle beam as an endoatmospheric point-defense
weapon. It turned out that the answer to one basic question of principle, namely
that the propagation of the beam over long distances in open air is possible, came
very soon.

Indeed, in his State of the Laboratory statement of 1987, the director of LLNL

was able able to highlight:

“A major accomplishment in the laboratory’s beam research program
was the ﬁrst demonstration of open-air propagation of an electron-
beam. Using the Advanced Test Accelerator (ATA), researchers were
able to tailor the electron beam to permit stable propagation in the
open air” [125, p.3].

In the Beam Research section of the same annual report, the following details

were given:

“Recently we successfully transported a high-intensity, 50-MeV elec-
tron beam from our Advanced Test Accelerator (ATA) into condition-
ing and diagnostic cells and then into free air. This test of stable beam

74

propagation in free air is the ﬁrst of its kind at this energy, level of
beam current (5 to 10 kA), and pulse rate (1 Hz). We have studied
carefully the effects of beam parameters upon stability in air and have
begun measurements of ancillary phenomena that will be important
in assessing the practicality of using high-intensity electron beams as
tactical weapons” [126, p.54].

However, none of the experimental details concerning these propagation ex-
periments appear to have been published. Neither will there be any more detailed
publications on the ATA and its uses over the following years until today. In partic-
ular, there is no information whether the ATA beam has been used as an input into
another, most probably circular, accelerator to increase its beam energy from 50
MeV to 500 MeV or more [117, 127, 128]. The only subsequent open publications
related to the ATA are those concerned with its use as a driver for a free-electron
laser, e.g., [129], or publications related to technological developments which may
be used to upgrade the ATA or to build highly reliable and efﬁcient components
for a new generation of high-current high-energy accelerators, e.g., [130].

In conclusion, if take the above statements for granted, we have to assume
that the ATA project has succeeded in meeting its stated goals. This means, in
particular, that single pulses must have propagated in a stable manner in free air
over a distance of at least one Nordsieck length, equation (4.25), i.e., about 20
meters according to the calculations made at the end of Section 4.3. Since ATA is
able to ﬁre ﬁve closely spaced pulses in a single burst, operation in this burst-mode
must have allowed to verify that the stable propagation of a tightly focused beam
is possible up to a distance of about 100 m. According to the available drawings
of the ATA facility, e.g., the cover page of the brochure [111], this range is about
the distance between the exit port of the ATA and the focal point of the out-doors
staging area.

10.2 RADLAC at Sandia National Laboratory

The main advantages of linear induction accelerators such as the ATA used for
beam research, or such as the FXR, DARHT, or AIRIX used for ﬂash x-ray
radiography, are their intrinsic simplicity and capability to produce high quality
beam pulses under reliable conditions. However, while such accelerators are well
suited for research applications, they are very heavy and bulky, and therefore not
suitable for applications in which relatively compact and light-weight accelerators
are required.

75

One alternative technology has been successfully developed by A.I. Pavlovskii
in the Soviet Union, with possible applications to linear induction accelerator
without iron [131, 72], and pulsed air-cored betatrons [132]. This technology,
which does not use ferrite- or iron-loaded cavities, was subsequently developed
in the United States, and the ﬁrst device based on this principle was built and
successfully operated at the Sandia National Laboratory [133]. The current and
energy achieved in this accelerator, called RADLAC-I, were of 25 kA and 9 MeV
with an average accelerating gradient of 3 MV/m. This accelerating gradient is
substantially larger than that of the ATA (about 0.5 MV/m) which implies that
the RADLAC is a promising candidate for a compact high-power accelerator.
Moreover, the RADLAC can operate at high repetition rates since it is not affected
by the classical beam breakup (BBU) instability, so that laser guiding of the beam
in a laser-generated channel within the accelerator is not necessary [133, p.1185].1

The RADLAC technology was substantially improved during the 1980s and the
construction of RADLAC-II initiated. This accelerator consists of two successives
accelerating modules called RIIM. Using such modules in succession a beam can
be accelerated to higher and higher energies. In 1985 RIIM was capable of reliable
operation at output levels of 40 kA and 9 MeV, [135].

With the RIIM operating, RADLAC-II could be assembled and beam propa-
gation experiments using its 40 kA, 18 MeV beam were soon successful [136]. In
early 1986 the beam was extracted, without signiﬁcant losses, and propagated into
a magnetic-ﬁeld-free, air-ﬁlled experimental tank. At a pressure of 1 atm the beam
propagated straight without oscillations, and the radius was measured to be about
0.75 cm, somewhat smaller than the 0.9 cm beam radius within the accelerator.
The RADLAC-II beam was then conditioned in a 16-m-long, ion-focused region,
and was allowed to propagate outside the accelerator building in open air where it
propagated in a stable manner for quite a distance. As a matter of fact, ﬁgure 9 of
reference [136] is an open-shutter photograph of the RADLAC-II beam propagat-
ing outdoors at night. The Manzano mountains of New Mexico are visible in the
background.

Subsequent publications gave no further details on out-doors propagation ex-
periments. Nevertheless, research and development did not stop there, as is
indicated by the summary presented at the subsequent DARPA conference [137] :

“RADLAC program activities are reviewed. The work is broadly
categorized under lead pulse stability (LPS), channel tracking, and
Recirculating Linear Accelerator (RLA) activities. In LPS activities,

accelerators in the United States and in Russia, see the review [134].

stable, open-air propagation of the RADLAC-II beam was demon-
strated over ranges longer than a Nordsieck length. These shots were
coordinated with the activities of other experimenters measuring beam
induced emissions, and demonstrated that RADLAC-II could be ﬁred
on a predetermined schedule to allow numerous, coordinated, and
geographically widespread measurements to be made. Since those
experiments, improvements in the RADLAC-II accelerator, ion focus
regime (IFR) beam conditioning cells, and matching of the accelerator
beam to those cells have produced a beam which should allow greater
than 20 betatron wavelengths in a Nordsieck length and saturation of
hose growth to be observed. Channel tracking activities have included
continued hardware development on the RADLAC-II Module (RIIM)
for pulse-to-pulse channel tracking, the design of a laser for conduc-
tivity channel tracking, and demonstration of a crude beam director for
a high current beam. Codes which allow channel tracking simulations
to be done have also been developed. Pulsed power and beam trans-
port experiments on the Recirculating Linac have led to hardware and
techniques which will allow demonstration of beam recirculation of a
high current beam this year and a recirculating linear accelerator next
year. These transport schemes and pulsed power developments can be
extended to higher energies and a conceptual RLA for Navy charged
particle beam weapon (CPBW) applications has been developed.”

As well as at the 1987 SDIO/DARPA Services Annual Propagation Review

[138] :

“The RADLAC program encompasses high power electron beam
propagation experiments and accelerator development, both for ad-
vanced propagation experiments and to develop compact accelerator
options for future charged particle beam weapons (CPBW). Propa-
gation experiments include conditioning cell and lead pulse stability
(LPS) experiments on RADLAC-II, and channel-tracking experiments
on IBEX. The RIIM accelerator was used for two-pulse accelerator ex-
periments to explore two-pulse conﬁgurations for RADLAC-II. The
ion focused regime (IFR) transported, recirculating linear accelera-
tor (RLA) experiment is aimed at future CPBW compact accelerator
development. This paper brieﬂy outlines recent work in these areas.”

Concerning the stable open-air propagation of the RADLAC-II beam, it is
remarquable that it is was demonstrated in 1986 already, [136], that is possibly

77

one year earlier than the same experiment with the ATA beam, [125, p.3] and [126,
p.54]. This illustrates both the maturity of the RADLAC technology, and the level
of the inter-US competition between national laboratories.

≈

As for the signiﬁcance of the RADLAC-II open-air experiments in comparison
to the corresponding ATA experiments, it should be remembered that what matters
most in ﬁrst order is beam power, as is shown by the elementary solution (4.24)
to the Nordsieck equation (4.22). For ATA the initial beam power is P0
≈
0.5 TW, and for RADLAC-II P0
0.72 TW. Therefore, according to Nordsieck’s
approximation, (4.25), RADLAC-II should have a single-pulse range on the order
of about 30 m, instead of about 20 m for ATA. However, if the calculations are
made by computer-integrating the complete beam envelope equation (4.18) using
Moli`ere’s theory of multiple scattering [31] and detailed energy-loss models, it
turns out that both RADLAC-II and ATA have about the same e-fold range of
In other words, while Nordsieck’s equation provides a
approximately 22 m.
good ﬁrst approximation (especially for beams of high-energy particles), computer
simulations are indispensable in the relatively low-energy domain in which both
ATA and RADLAC-II are operating.

A ﬁnal important conclusion deriving from the RADLAC-II stable propagation
experiments is that the plasma generation current (5.8), which should tend to limit
stable propagation to currents less then about 10 kA, does not appear to be so
critical, since the RADLAC-II beam intensity is of 40 kA.

10.3 LIA-10 and LIA-30 at Arzamas-16

As it originally started in the Soviet Union, e.g., [131, 132, 72], it is obvious that
the development, and most certainly the use for beam propagation experiments,
of iron-free linear induction accelerators continued in Russia. Indeed, the LIA-10
accelerator of the 1970-1980s was upgraded to yield 50 kA for a 25 MeV pulse
of 20 ns duration in 1993, and the construction of a new accelerator, LIA-30,
producing a beam of 100 kA at 40 MeV, initiated [139].

However, there are no published results on long-range beam propagation ex-
periments using these facilities. Moreover, while there is substancial published
work on Russian beam propagation experiments through low-pressure air or even
laser formed channels, e.g., [140, 141], there appears to be no open publications
available on experiments similar to those made with ATA and RADLAC.2

2The Rand Corporation report [141] mentions that: “A follow-on report will discuss Soviet
research on the propagation of intense relativistic electron beams through higher-pressure air and

10.4 PHERMEX at Los Alamos National Labora-

tory

A third technology suitable for making compact high-power accelerators is the
more conventional standing-wave radio-frequency linac technology used in most
high-energy linear accelerators built for fundamental nuclear and elementary-
particles research. Using this technology, it is theoretically possible to accelerate
a 10 kA beam pulse from 10 to 1000 MeV in a 30-meter-long linear accelerator
[142].

This technology was in fact used in the ﬁrst high-power ﬂash x-ray facility,
the PHERMEX accelerator complete in 1963, built at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory to study the implosion of nuclear weapon’s primaries [143]. As this
facility was expected to be superseeded by more powerful induction linacs (such
as the DARHT, which is now operating) it was suggested in the early 1980s that
PHERMEX could possibly be upgraded and used to study the endoatmospheric
propagation of electron beams [22].

While the RF-linac technology has a few disadvantages compared to the
induction-linac technology (e.g., a relatively short pulse length), it has an in-
trinsic high repetition rate and multi-pulse capability. Besides, PHERMEX is
located “in a blast-proof building at a remote, controlled access site [where] a
clear line of site of approximately 2000 meters exists” [22, p.2].

In fact, some preliminary propagation experiments were performed using the
available beam [144], and PHERMEX was subsequently upgraded to operate in
the, up to 3 kA intensity, 20–60 MeV energy range which was anticipated to be
theoretically possible [22, 145].

Emittance measurements for typical 300–500 A, 26 MeV, 3.3 ns micropulses
were published [146], as well as several papers indicating that there are plans to
inject the PHERMEX beam into a circular accelerator [147, 148, 128]. Besides
increasing the beam energy, such an accelerator would have the advantage of
providing a means to accumulate and condition the beam pulses before sending
them into the atmosphere with a suitably larger energy, current, and duration.

In
There are, however, no subsequent publications on these developments.

a higher-energy circular (or even possibly linear, see [142, p.2]) accelerator, and

gases (P > 10−2 Torr).”

79

10.5 Proton and muon beams

So far we have only considered experiments in which high-intensity electron beams
are generated, accelerated, and injected into the atmosphere. The main reason for
this was that electron-beam machines with currents in the kiloampere range still
appear to be the only available ones to study endoatmospheric beam propagation
over distances on the order of one or more Nordsieck lengths. Nevertheless, in
view of the potentially larger range of proton versus electron beams, see Figures
4.2 and 4.3, and other interests such as ion-driven thermonuclear fusion, research
on high-current proton beam sources suitable for injecting a multi-kiloampere
pulse into an accelerator is under way since quite some times. This is illustrated,
for example, by the 6.0-kA, 1.1-MV proton beam obtained at Cornell University
Laboratory of Plasma Studies [149].

Similarly, considerable research is underway for producing high-intensity low-
emittance muon beams for fundamental research [150]. If the techniques used for
producing these beams could be extrapolated to yield sufﬁciently powerful pulses
of muons, a single such pulse could in principle propagate (according to Figure
4.2 and 4.3) to ranges of up to several km in open air. The main problem with
muons, however, is that they are short-lived particles, with a life-time τµ of only 2.2
microseconds at rest. Nevertheless, if the muons are accelerated, say to 1000 MeV
(which since the mass of the muon is mµ = 105 MeV/c2 corresponds to a Lorentz
factor of γ
6.6 km
before decaying. Therefore, in theory, a series of high-energy muon beam pulses
could be used either to strike a target at a distance of tens of kilometers, or else
to bore a channel in the atmosphere to guide a more powerful electron or proton
beam to a distant target [76].

10) they would be able to propagate to a distance of γcτµ ≈

≈

While such a concept may look very futuristic at present, it should nevertheless
be seriously assessed in view of several synergistic factors which relate muon beam
technology to other advanced beam technologies of importance to the subject of
this report. For example, there is strong similarity between the techniques used
to produce muons (see, e.g., chapters 2 to 4 in reference [150]) and those used to
produce antiprotons (see, e.g., [80]) : In both cases the simplest method consists
of striking a production-target with a sufﬁciently high-energy proton beam to
generate copious amounts of either muons or antiprotons during the collisions, to
collect as many as possible of these particles with a magnetic lens, and to decrease
their kinetic energy dispersion (i.e, to “cool” them) in order to form a sufﬁciently
low-emittance beam, which can then be stored or directly used for some purpose.3

3Another link between muon and antimatter technology, which was already mentioned in
Chapter 8, is that antimatter is the sole portable source of muons, in the sense that upon annihilation

80

Moreover, if instead of producing the muons with a high-energy proton beam,
a high-intensity electron beam is used instead, one is led to a system involving
a multi-megawatt muon production-target driven by a multi-kiloampere electron
beam, which requires the kind of technologies and experience associated with
accelerators such as the ATA [151].4

In practice, the kind of muon production and cooling systems envisaged or un-
der construction at present, e.g., [150, 153], are not expected to be fully operational
before 2006–2010. Also, their muon yield will be orders of magnitudes below
what would be needed to envisage concentrating a bunch of them into a pulse
suitable for propagation in self-pinched mode over a signiﬁcant distance in open
air. Nevertheless, this situation is quite similar to that of antiproton “factories,”
which have increased (and still increase) their output by many orders of magnitude
over the years.

every antiproton yields on average between 2 and 3 muons, which could be fed to a collecting and
cooling system without needing a high-energy beam to produce the muons in the ﬁrst place [76].
4The ﬁrst author of this paper headed the ATA project for a number of years, see [23, 112].
It should be remarked that in an electron-beam based system, the same high-power electron
accelerator could be used as a driver for either a free-electron-laser or a muon-factory, which
would both provide a means to guide the more powerful electron-beam towards a distant target.
For more examples of such synergies, see, e.g., [152].

Conclusion

In this report we have reviewed the theory and the proof-of-principle experiments
which have been carried out to demonstrate that high-intensity high-energy particle
beam propagation in full or reduced-density atmosphere was possible, and that the
range and stability of the beam pulses were in agreement with theory.

We have, however, not analysed the practical consequencies of these conclu-
sions, which determine with certainty the range of physical parameters compatible
with realistic high-power directed-energy particle beam systems; neither have we
investigated the R&D related to the possible construction and deployment of such
systems. These are the subjects of a companion report,1 of which only a small
part, concerned with the radiological effects of directed high-intensity high-energy
electron beams, has so far been published [154].

Nevertheless, by going through the theory and the details of several important
experiments, we have followed several complete “research cycles,” that is several
paths going from some initial ideas to their veriﬁcation by means of a suitable
experimental program. In the present case the outcomes of these research cycles
can be qualiﬁed as “scientiﬁcally successful,” meaning that the technical feasibility
of some concepts have been established. While this is important, it does not mean
that the associated technologies should necessarily be developed and applied,
which is precisely the motivation for writing this report.2

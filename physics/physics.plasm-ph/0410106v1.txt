Abstract. Doppler reﬂectometry is considered in slab plasma model
in the
frameworks of analytical theory. The diagnostics locality is analyzed for both regimes:
linear and nonlinear in turbulence amplitude. The toroidal antenna focusing of probing
beam to the cut-oﬀ is proposed and discussed as a method to increase diagnostics
spatial resolution. It is shown that even in the case of nonlinear regime of multiple
scattering, the diagnostics can be used for an estimation (with certain accuracy) of
plasma poloidal rotation proﬁle.

1. Introduction

One of widespread methods used nowadays for plasma rotation velocity measurements
is Doppler reﬂectometry [1, 2, 3]. This technique provides measuring ﬂuctuations
propagation poloidal velocity which is often shown to be dominated by plasma poloidal
rotation velocity [3]. The method is based on plasma probing with a microwave beam
which is tilted in respect to plasma density gradient (see ﬁgure 1). A back-scattered
signal with frequency diﬀering from the probing one is registered by a nearby standing
or the same antenna. The information on plasma poloidal rotation is obtained in
this technique from the frequency shift of the backscattering (BS) spectrum which is
supposed to originate from the Doppler eﬀect due to the ﬂuctuation rotation.

Analytical theory of Doppler reﬂectometry was developed in recent papers [4, 5, 6],
using analytical approach in slab plasma model, which is reliable for elongated plasma
of large tokamaks. The linear case of probing wave single-scattering is considered there
as well as the nonlinear process of the signal formation due to multi-scattering eﬀect,
which is essential for long probing ray trajectory, typical for large fusion devices. The
diagnostics spatial and wavenumber resolution is determined and means to increase the
method locality are discussed.

The present paper is devoted mainly to two following topics. First of all, we modify
the linear theory of Doppler reﬂectometry taking into account possible antenna focusing
in toroidal direction, which allows the diagnostics spatial resolution to be enhanced

without deteriorating the poloidal wavenumber selectivity, which takes place in case
of poloidal focusing, discussed in [4]. Secondly, we compare the diagnostics locality
in linear and non-linear regime and dwell upon experimental evidences, allowing us to
distinguish these two cases.

2. Toroidal focusing in linear theory of Doppler reﬂectometry

In our consideration we follow our paper [4], taking into account possible antenna
focusing in toroidal direction, which was not considered there. The study is made in the
frameworks of geometrical optics (or WKB) approach, and the reader is referred to [4]
for more accurate procedure, applied to the cut-oﬀ vicinity, where WKB approximation
is not valid.

We consider normalized antenna electric ﬁeld in the following form

where y, z axes denote poloidal and toroidal directions. Factor f (ky, kz) takes into
account the antenna pattern describing antenna radiation in vacuum

Considering toroidal focusing inﬂuence on the FS eﬃciency, it should be noted that
the focusing increases the amplitude of FS signal (6), but does not improve its locality.
The inﬂuence of the factors discussed on the spectrum of the registered signal
is illustrated in the modelling, described in [4], and the results can be found below
in section 4 (see ﬁgure 3 and ﬁgure 4) in comparison with spectra, modelled in nonlinear
diagnostics regime. Now let us dwell upon the spectrum modelling, illustrating the
antenna toroidal focusing inﬂuence. We consider the density proﬁle of DIII-D tokamak
plasma with internal transport barrier (ﬁgure 2(a)) [10]. The probing is performed
at diﬀerent frequencies and therefore with diﬀerent cut-oﬀ positions. Here we take

Despite the fact that density proﬁle in the barrier region is favorable for the
diagnostics [4], antenna focusing makes the spectrum shift more adequate to the behavior

3. Noninear theory of Doppler reﬂectometry

In the section we review brieﬂy the nonlinear analytical theory of Doppler reﬂectometry,
which is considered in details in [5, 6]. In case of long enough trajectory length and
suﬃcient turbulence amplitude, when the following criterion [11]

turbulence radial correlation length, we can neglect the BS during the wave propagation
and consider multiple FS of the probing wave only. The density ﬂuctuations in this case
can be taken into account as a phase modulation during the probing wave propagation

(ii) We consider the same antenna for the probing and reception. The probing is
performed at diﬀerent frequencies and therefore with diﬀerent cut-oﬀ positions.

(iii) For the sake of simplicity we suppose the turbulence level to be uniform (˜n = 0.03)
and its wavenumber spectra to be gaussian. The ﬂuctuations are believed to be low-
frequency to neglect the spectrum width in case of homogeneous poloidal velocity
proﬁle.

First of all we consider plasma density proﬁle (ﬁgure 3(a)) similar to observed in
Tore Supra [12] and step-like plasma poloidal velocity distribution (ﬁgure 3(b)). The
registered signal
frequency shift (ﬁgure 3(c)) is calculated using (13), but, as it
is usually done in experiment results interpretation, the measured poloidal velocity
proﬁle (ﬁgure 3(b)) is deduced from frequency spectrum shift using equation (12) for
traditional (linear) Doppler eﬀect in assumption that the registered signal spectrum
shift corresponds to velocity in the cut-oﬀ.

It can be seen that the value of poloidal velocity measured in such a way coincides
with assumed one in case of homogeneous poloidal velocity distribution and diﬀers
from it when the cut-oﬀ is situated in the region of variable velocity. In this case large
contribution to the ˆ
q2v value is made by far from the cut-oﬀ regions due to unfavorable
L
bent-down density proﬁle, leading to the obscuration of the velocity in the cut-oﬀ. Thus
such an interpretation of the diagnostics results gives the value of the poloidal velocity
averaged in a speciﬁc way over plasma volume.

The frequency spectrum shift is compared in ﬁgure 3(c) with spectrum width,
It can be seen that spectrum width can be larger then

frequency spectrum shift, which is typical for Doppler reﬂectometry experimental
results. Besides, ﬁgure 3(c) demonstrates the spectrum width behavior which was
described above: the spectrum is not broadened when probing wave propagates only in
the region with homogeneous poloidal velocity (here we neglected the broadening, which
arises due to intrinsic frequency spectrum of the turbulence) and broadens, when the
cut-oﬀ, which is the bound of propagation region, crosses the point, where the velocity
changes.

In addition, in ﬁgure 3(b) we compare the diagnostics results in linear and nonlinear
regimes. In the both cases the plasma density proﬁle is unfavorable for the diagnostics
spatial resolution, but one can see that nonlinear regime is more problematic from the
results interpretation point of view.

The second example is to emphasize the importance of plasma density proﬁle for
frequency spectrum formation. We consider plasma density proﬁle (ﬁgure 4(a)) bent
down in plasma periphery and bent up in the core. The poloidal velocity proﬁle has high
gradient in the ‘barrier’ region (ﬁgure 4(b)). It is easy to see that bent-up density proﬁle
underlines the cut-oﬀ contribution and improves the locality of the method. Also this
eﬀect is essential for linear Doppler reﬂectometry [4]. It leads to the fact that in case of
favorable density proﬁle the poloidal velocity proﬁle measured by Doppler reﬂectometry
corresponds to the certain extent to the real one.

Let us discuss the situation when the nonlinear theory developed should be applied.
The nonlinear regime of Doppler reﬂectometry diagnostics is considered in the present
paper, when multiple FS inﬂuence is essential for registered signal spectrum formation.

For this situation to take place, two important criteria should be satisﬁed. At ﬁrst, the
turbulence amplitude is to be large enough to provide essential turbulent phase shift
during the wave propagation, which is described by criterion (7).

The second condition leading to the necessity of nonlinear theory application to
the diagnostics results is that small-angle scattering contribution is substantial in the
received signal. This means that small-angle scattering signal amplitude should be
comparable or larger than BS signal, formed by linear mechanism. Multiple small-angle

Another way to recognize the scattering regime is to compare BS signal spectrum
width with one, provided by the antenna pattern due to the Doppler eﬀect. In case of
more broadened spectrum we deal with nonlinear regime of scattering.

The criteria of nonlinear theory applicability discussed can be usually satisﬁed in
large toroidal devices. But we should note that the nonlinear regime can be realized in
small tokamak due to possible reﬂection of the probing signal oﬀ the chamber wall (this
eﬀect for FT-2 tokamak was investigated experimentally in [13]). It leads to the eﬀective
increase of the ray trajectory, which can provide the satisfaction of the criterion (7).
The signal spectrum of the signal can be estimated in this case using the results of our
consideration (10), but the operator ˆ
(11) should be multiplied by the quantity of the
L
reﬂections oﬀ the plasma and wall.

5. Conclusion

In the present paper the Doppler reﬂectometry is considered in slab plasma model in
the frameworks of analytical theory. The diagnostics locality is analyzed for linear and
nonlinear regime. The toroidal beam focusing to the cut-oﬀ is proposed and discussed
as a method to increase diagnostics spatial resolution.

In nonlinear diagnostics regime frequency spectrum shift and width of registered
backscattered signal is analyzed in dependence on plasma density proﬁle, turbulence
spatial distribution and spectrum and plasma poloidal velocity proﬁle.
It is
demonstrated that the frequency shift is not inﬂuenced by turbulence absolute amplitude
and gives an information on poloidal velocity averaged over the vicinity of the cut-oﬀ,
the size of which depends on the density proﬁle and turbulence distribution.

Thus, even in the complicated situation of multi-scattering dominance Doppler
reﬂectometry technique is proved to be able to give realistic information on plasma
rotation. The spatial resolution of the diagnostics, however, suﬀers from transition
to this nonlinear regime of scattering. The consideration presented allows the spatial
resolution of the method to be analyzed for real experimental conditions, and thus the
diagnostics results to be adequately interpreted.

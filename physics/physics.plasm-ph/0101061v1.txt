An exact analytical method for determining the Lagrangian velocity correlation and the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient for particles moving in a stochastic velocity ﬁeld is derived. It applies to divergence-
free 2-dimensional Gaussian stochastic ﬁelds which are stationary, homogeneous and have factorized
Eulerian correlations.

Test particle motion in stochastic velocity ﬁelds is a generic problem in various topics of ﬂuid and plasma turbu-
lence or solid state physics [1]. The main diﬃculty in determining the resulting time dependent (running) diﬀusion
coeﬃcients and mean square displacements consists in calculating the Lagrangian velocity correlation function (LVC).
This is a very complex quantity which requires the knowledge of the statistical properties of the stochastic trajectories
determined by the random velocity ﬁeld. The vast majority of existing works employ under various guises the Corrsin
approximation [2]. The physical parameter which characterizes such process of diﬀusion by continuous movements
is the Kubo number K (deﬁned below) which measures particle’s capacity of exploring the space structure of the
stochastic velocity ﬁeld before the latter changes. In the weak turbulence case K
1, particle motion is of Brownian
type and the results are well established. In the strong turbulence case (K > 1), this structure of the velocity ﬁeld has
an important inﬂuence on the LVC and on the scaling of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in K. This inﬂuence is most eﬀective
in the special case of 2-dimensional divergence-free stochastic velocity ﬁelds and consists in a dynamical trapping of
the trajectories in the structure of the ﬁeld. The existing analytical methods completely fail in describing this process
[3] and the studies usually rely on direct numerical simulations of particle trajectories [4], on asymptotic methods
such as the renormalization group techniques [1] or on qualitative estimates [5]. In recent works [6] a rather diﬀerent
statistical approach (the decorrelation trajectory method) was proposed for determining the LVC for given Eulerian
correlation of the velocity ﬁeld. The case of collisional particles was treated in [7]. We prove here that, in the special
case of 2-dimensional divergence-free velocity ﬁelds, under the assumptions mentioned below, this method yields the
exact analytical expression of the Lagrangian velocity correlation valid for arbitrary value of the Kubo number. The
assumptions concern the statistical properties of the stochastic velocity ﬁeld and are rather natural for a large class
of physical processes. It is considered to be a stationary and homogeneous Gaussian (normal) stochastic ﬁeld, either
static or time dependent with statistically independent space and time variations such that the Eulerian correlation
function has a factorized structure as in Eq.(4) below.

Particle motion in a 2-dimensional stochastic velocity ﬁeld is described by the nonlinear Langevin equation:

dx(t)

= v(x(t), t),

x(0) = 0

where x(t) represents the trajectory in Cartesian coordinates x
divergence-free:
the stream function (or potential) φ(x, t), as:

(x1, x2). The stochastic velocity ﬁeld v(x, t) is
v(x, t) = 0 and thus its two components v1 an v2 can be determined from a stochastic scalar ﬁeld,

homogeneous as well. We assume that they have zero averages:

For small Kubo numbers (quasilinear regime), the results are well established:

the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is
DQL = (λ2/τc)K 2. At large K the time variation of the stochastic potential is slow and the trajectories can fol-
low approximately the contour lines of φ(x, t). This produces a trapping eﬀect : the trajectories are conﬁned for long
periods in small regions. A typical trajectory shows an alternation of large displacements and trapping events. The
latter appear when the particles are close to the maxima or minima of the stream function and consists of trajectory
winding on almost closed small size paths. The large displacements are produced when the trajectories are at small
absolute values of the stream function.

The main idea in our method is to study the Langevin equation (1) in subensembles (S) of the realizations of the
stochastic ﬁeld which are determined by given values of the stream function and of the velocity in the starting point
of the trajectories:

The LVC for the whole set of realizations can is obtained by summing up the contributions of all subensembles (9):

function and respectively for the initial velocity. As shown below, there are two important advantages determined by
this procedure: (i) the LVC can be determined from one-point subensemble averages and (ii) the invariance of the
stream function along the trajectory can be used for obtaining the average of the Lagrangian velocity and the LVC
in (S).

The stream function and the velocity reduced in the subensemble (S) are still Gaussian stochastic ﬁelds but non-

stationary and non-homogeneous and with space-time dependent average values:

which shows that the average velocity in the subensemble (S) is divergence-free:
identiﬁed in the zero-average stochastic velocity ﬁeld a set of average velocities (labeled by φ0, v0) which contain
the statistical characteristics of the velocity ﬁeld (the correlation and the constraint imposed in the problem, i.e. the
zero divergence condition). The LVC in (S) is:

at any time. A deterministic trajectory X(t; S) can be deﬁned in each subensemble (S) such that the average of
the Eulerian stream function in (S) (Eq.(11)) calculated along this trajectory equals the average Lagrangian stream
function (15):

φ(x(t))

(15)

Since the Eulerian average potential (11) has the value φ0 in x = 0, the trajectory X(t; S) can be determined from
the following Hamiltonian system of equations with ΦS(X) as Hamiltonian function:

and with the initial condition X(0; S) = 0. The trajectory in each realization in (S) can be referred to this deterministic
(realization-independent) trajectory, x(t) = X(t; S) + δx(t). Using the deﬁnition of the velocity (2) and expressing the
space derivatives as derivatives with respect to the deterministic part of the trajectory in each realization and then
averaging in the subensemble (S), the average Lagrangian velocity in (S) is obtained as:

iS = VS (X(t; S))
where Eq.(13) was used. Thus, the average Lagrangian velocity in the subensemble (S) is just the corresponding
Eulerian quantity calculated along the deterministic trajectory X(t; S). Since the latter is determined by solving
Eq.(17), where the r.h.s. is the average Lagrangian velocity, it follows that X(t; S) is precisely the average trajectory
in (S) :

Similar results are obtained in the time-dependent case φ(x, t) (ﬁnite τc and K) if the space and time dependences
are statistically independent in the sense that the EC of φ(x, t) is given by Eq.(4). The stream function is not a true
φ(x(t), t) at any moment and only the explicit
invariant of the motion. However the velocity is still perpendicular to

ΦS(x, t) = ΦS(x) h(t),

VS(x, t) = VS(x) h(t)

X(t; S) = X(θ(t); S)

Due to the factorized EC (4) considered here, the average Eulerian stream function and velocity (11), (12) can be
written as:

where ΦS(x) and VS(x) are the corresponding quantities in the static case. We deﬁne in (S) a deterministic trajectory
X(t; S) as the solution of the time dependent Hamiltonian system with ΦS(X, t) as Hamiltonian function. Performing
t
0 dτ h(τ ), the time dependent Hamiltonian system reduces to Eq.(17) and thus the
the change of variable t
trajectory X(t; S) can be written as:
R

θ(t) =

where X(θ; S) is the deterministic trajectory obtained in the static case. On the other hand, the average Lagrangian
potential corresponding to Eq.(21) can be written as
iS = G(t) h(t) where the factor h(t) ”propagates”
unchanged from the Eulerian average to the Lagrangian one, and G(t) is the contribution of the space dependence.
Taking the time derivative of this equation one obtains using Eq.(20):

φ(x(t), t)

It follows that d
is:

φ(x(t), t)
h

iS /dt = G(t)dh/dt and thus G(t) = φ0 and the average Lagrangian stream function in (S)

Using Eq.(24) and (21) and the deﬁnition of X(t; S), one ﬁnds that the average Eulerian stream function calculated
along the deterministic trajectory X(t; S) equals, as in the static case, the average Lagrangian stream function:

Following the same arguments as in the static case, the average Lagrangian velocity in (S) is determined as:

φ(x(t), t)

iS = φ0 h(t).

and the deterministic trajectory X(t; S) is the average trajectory in (S):

We have thus obtained the subensemble averages of the Lagrangian stream function and velocity. These averages
of random functions of random arguments appear to be equal to the average functions evaluated at the average
argument. We note that this surprisingly simple result which is usually wrong for stochastic functions is exact for the
special case studied here. This property is essentially due to the very strong constraint imposed by the invariance of
the stream function along the trajectories.

The LVC (6) and the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient (8), are determined using Eqs. (10) and (14) as:

We note that Eqs.(28)-(31) represent the exact solution for the diﬀusion problem studied here (both for static
and time-dependent case). Two functions are involved in the expressions for the LVC and D(t). One is the time
dependence h(t) of the EC of the stream function. This accounts for the explicit time decorrelation and remains
unchanged when passing from Eulerian to Lagrangian quantities. The other is the function F (τ ) which results from
the space dependence of the EC of the stream function (i.e. from the Lagrangian nonlinearity). It is obtained as an
integral over the subensembles (S) of the average displacements along the initial velocity v0.

The trajectories obtained from Eq.(17) lie on closed paths (except for φ0 = 0 which correspond to a straight
φ0
line along v0). The size of these paths is large for small
φ0
increases. At small time τ,
X(τ ; u, p) ∼= uτ and F (τ ) ∼= τ. At large time τ, the trajectory X(τ ; u, p) turns periodically along the corresponding
(cid:12)

dynamical trapping of the trajectories. The characteristic features of this self-consistent trapping process observed in
the numerical simulations are recovered in the structure of this function. It shows that only a part of the trajectories

In a static stream function (K, τc

the process is subdiﬀusive. This can easily be recovered in the general result (28)-(31). The average trajectories in
the subensembles (S) are periodic functions of time and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient (29) is D(t) = β F (V t/λ) . It goes to

In the time dependent case, the time variation of the stream function determines a decorrelation eﬀect which leads
to a diﬀusive process. This is reﬂected in the average trajectories in the subensembles (S) (determined by Eqs.(27),
(23)) which are not anymore periodic functions of time but all of them saturate as t
(possibly after performing
many rotations around the corresponding paths). Consequently, the decay of the function F saturates at F (K θ∞)

In conclusion, we have presented here an exact solution for the turbulent diﬀusion problem for a class of velocity
ﬁelds. We have obtained analytical expressions for the LVC and D(t) which are valid for arbitrary values of the Kubo
number and describes the complicated process of dynamic trajectory trapping in the structure of the stochastic ﬁeld.
The basic idea of the method consists of determining the LVC by means of a set of average Lagrangian velocities
estimated in subensembles of realizations of the stochastic ﬁeld which are deﬁned taking into account the invariants
of the motion. It can be extended, at least as a new type of approximation, to other types of stochastic velocity ﬁelds.

A stochastic representation for the
Poisson-Vlasov equation

R. Vilela Mendes∗†and Fernanda Cipriano‡

Abstract

A stochastic representation for the solutions of the Poisson-Vlasov
equation is obtained. The representation involves both an exponential
and a branching process. The stochastic representation, besides pro-
viding an alternative existence proof and an intuitive characterization
of the solutions, may also be used to obtain an intrinsic deﬁnition of
the ﬂuctuations.

1 Introduction

The solutions of linear elliptic and parabolic equations, both with Cauchy
and Dirichlet boundary conditions, have a probabilistic interpretation, which
not only provides intuition on the nature of the problems described by these
equations, but is also quite useful in the proof of general theorems. This
is a very classical ﬁeld which may be traced back to the work of Courant,
Friedrichs and Lewy [1] in the 20’s. In spite of the pioneering work of McKean
[2], the question of whether useful probabilistic representations could also be
found for a large class of nonlinear equations remained an essentially open
problem for many years.

It was only in the 90’s that, with the work of Dynkin[3] [4], such a theory
started to take shape. For nonlinear diﬀusion processes, the branching exit

Markov systems, that is, processes that involve diﬀusion and branching, seem
to play the same role as Brownian motion in the linear equations. However
the theory is still limited to some classes of nonlinearities and there is much
room for further mathematical improvement.

Another ﬁeld, where considerable recent advances were achieved, was the
probabilistic representation of the Fourier transformed Navier-Stokes equa-
tion, ﬁrst with the work of LeJan and Sznitman[5], later followed by extensive
developments of the Oregon school[6] [7] [8]. In all cases the stochastic rep-
resentation deﬁnes a process for which the mean values of some functionals
coincide with the solution of the deterministic equation.

Stochastic representations, in addition to its intrinsic mathematical rele-

vance, have several practical implications:

(i) They provide an intuitive characterization of the equation solutions;
(ii) They provide a calculation tool which may replace, for example, the

need for very ﬁne integration grids at high Reynolds numbers;

(iii) By associating a stochastic process to the solutions of the equation,
they provide an intrinsic characterization of the nature of the ﬂuctuations
In some cases the stochastic process is
associated to the physical system.
essentially unique, in others there is a class of processes with means leading to
the same solution. The physical signiﬁcance of this feature is worth exploring.
A ﬁeld where stochastic representations have not yet been developed (and
where for the practical applications cited above they might be useful) is the
ﬁeld of kinetic equations for charged ﬂuids. As a ﬁrst step towards this
goal, a stochastic representation is here constructed for the solutions of the
Poisson-Vlasov equation.

The comments in the ﬁnal section point towards future work, in partic-
ular on how a stochastic representation may be used for a characterization
of ﬂuctuations, alternative to existing methods. This is what we call the
stochastic principle.

Once h (ξ1) consistent with (C) is found, conditions (A) and (B) only put
restrictions on the initial conditions and the background charge. Now one
constructs the stochastic process X (ξ1, ξ2, τ ).

Because e−λτ is the survival probability during time τ of an exponential
process with parameter λ and λe−λsds the decay probability in the interval
(s, s + ds), χ (ξ1, ξ2, τ ) in Eq.(9) is obtained as the expectation value of a
multiplicative functional for the following backward-in-time process:

Starting at (ξ1, ξ2, τ ), a particle lives for an exponentially distributed
time s up to time τ − s. At its death a coin ls (probabilities 1
2) is tossed.
If ls = 0 two new particles are born at time τ − s with Fourier modes

ues its backward-in-time evolution, following the same death and birth laws.

condition. The multiplicative functional of the process is the product of the

the absolute value of all coupling constants is bounded by one. The branch-
ing process, being identical to a Galton-Watson process, terminates with
probability one and the number of inputs to the functional is ﬁnite (with
probability one). With the bounds on the coupling constants, the multi-
plicative functional is bounded by one in absolute value almost surely.

Once a stochastic representation is obtained for χ (ξ1, ξ2, τ ), one also has,
by (8), a stochastic representation for the solution of the Fourier-transformed
Poisson-Vlasov equation. The results are summarized in the following :

Theorem 2.1 - There is a stochastic representation for the Fourier-
transformed solution of the Poisson-Vlasov equation F (ξ1, ξ2, t) for any ar-
bitrary ﬁnite value of the arguments, provided the initial conditions at time
zero and the background charge satisfy the boundedness conditions (A) and
(B).

7

As a corollary one also infers an existence result for (arbitrarily large)
ﬁnite time. Notice that existence by the stochastic representation method re-
quires only boundedness conditions on the initial conditions and background
charge and not any strict smoothness properties.

3 Fluctuations and the stochastic principle.

A comment

In the past, the ﬂuctuation spectrum of charged ﬂuids was studied either by
the BBGKY hierarchy derived from the Liouville or Klimontovich equations,
with some sort of closure approximation, or by direct approximations to the
N-body partition function or by models of dressed test particles, etc. (see
reviews in [9] [10]). Alternatively, by linearizing the Vlasov equation about
a stable solution and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, a canonical partition
function may be used to compute correlation functions [11].

However, one should remember that, as a model for charged ﬂuids, the
Vlasov equation is just a mean-ﬁeld collisionless theory. Therefore, it is
unlikely that, by itself, it will contain full information on the ﬂuctuation
spectrum. Kinetic and ﬂuid equations are obtained from the full particle
dynamics in the 6N-dimensional phase-space by a chain of reductions. Along
the way, information on the actual nature of ﬂuctuations and turbulence
may have been lost. An accurate model of turbulence may exist at some
intermediate (mesoscopic) level, but not necessarily in the ﬁnal mean-ﬁeld
equation.

When a stochastic representation is constructed, one obtains a process
for which the mean value is the solution of the mean-ﬁeld equation. The
process itself contains more information. This does not mean, of course, that
the process is an accurate mesoscopic model of Nature, because we might be
climbing up a path diﬀerent from the one that led us down from the particle
dynamics.

Nevertheless, insofar as the stochastic representation is qualitatively unique
and related to some reasonable iterative process1, it provides a surrogate
mesoscopic model from which ﬂuctuations are easily computed. This is what
we refer to as the stochastic principle. At the minimum, one might say that

1Representations as those constructed for the Navier-Stokes equation and the one in

this paper may be looked at as a stochastic version of Picard iteration

8

the stochastic principle provides another closure procedure.

A SHARP STABILITY CRITERION FOR THE
VLASOV-MAXWELL SYSTEM

ZHIWU LIN AND WALTER A. STRAUSS

Abstract. We consider the linear stability problem for a 3D cylindrically
symmetric equilibrium of the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system that describes
a collisionless plasma. For an equilibrium whose distribution function decreases
monotonically with the particle energy, we obtained a linear stability criterion
in our previous paper [23]. Here we prove that this criterion is sharp; that is,
there would otherwise be an exponentially growing solution to the linearized
1
system. We also treat the considerably simpler periodic 1
2 D case. The new
formulation introduced here is applicable as well to the nonrelativistic case, to
other symmetries, and to general equilibria.

1. Introduction

We consider a plasma at such high temperature or low density that collisions can
be ignored compared with the electromagnetic forces. Such a collisionless plasma is
modeled by the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell (RVM) system. We assume all physical
constants like the speed of light c and the mass of particles m to be 1, for the
sole purpose of simplifying our notation. All the results we obtain below can be
modiﬁed straightforwardly to apply to the true physical situations with general
masses, charges, etc. In the physical literature, the nonrelativistic version of the
Vlasov-Maxwell system is more commonly considered but our results easily extend
to that case. Our notation is as follows. Let f ± (t, x, v) be the ion and electron
distribution functions, E(t, x) and B(t, x) be the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and
Eext, Bext be the external ﬁelds. Then the RVM system is

One of the central problems in the theory of plasmas is to understand plasma
stability and instability ([25], [29]). For example, to control the plasma instability in
a fusion device is a key issue for the nuclear fusion program. Many other examples
occur in astrophysical contexts. So far, most studies on plasma stability are based
on macroscopic MHD models. For such ﬂuid models, the famous energy principle
was discovered by Bernstein, Frieman, Kruskal and Kulsrud ([1]) in the 1950s, ﬁrst

for static equilibria and later for symmetry-preserving perturbations of symmetric
equilibria ([26]). These energy principles allow one to reduce the study of linear
stability to checking the positivity of a certain relatively simple quadratic energy
form W (ξ, ξ). They have been widely used in the plasma physics community ([4],
[7]) to study many types of important plasma instabilities. However, the collision-
dominant assumption required in deriving these MHD models from kinetic models
is seriously violated in many almost collisionless situations in nuclear fusion ([4])
and space plasmas ([27]). This puts into question the applicability of such energy
principles in physical situations where collisions are infrequent. While energy prin-
ciples have been derived for some simple approximate models, such as collisionless
MHD and guiding center models ([18] [19] [8]), there have been very few such studies
on the more accurate but more complicated microscopic Vlasov-Maxwell models.
A good understanding of stability for Vlasov systems could provide a theoretical
basis to compare and check the validity of stability results for various approximate
plasma models like MHD. Moreover, many plasma instability phenomena have an
essentially microscopic nature, for which kinetic models like Vlasov-Maxwell are
required ([27]).

Combining the results of this paper with [23], we have established an energy prin-
ciple for a large class of symmetric equilibria of various Vlasov-Maxwell systems.
More precisely, for a large class of equilibria that enjoy certain kinds of symme-
try, the study of linear stability of symmetry-preserving perturbations is reduced

Now we state our main result for the cylindrically symmetric 3D case. As re-
marked in ([23]), the existence of a plasma equilibrium of the 3D RVM model in
the whole space requires an external ﬁeld. To simplify notation we consider a 3D
nonneutral electron plasma with an external ﬁeld. This scenario does indeed does
occur in many physical situations ([2]). So f + = 0, and instead of f − we use
the notation f for the electrons. Our equilibrium is cylindrically symmetric with
electron distribution f 0 = µ (e, p) , where

We assume that the equilibrium is conﬁned, namely that f 0 has compact support
S in phase space. Having compact support is a realistic assumption for a conﬁned
plasma. We make the further assumption that f 0 and E0, B0 are continuous ev-
erywhere, including on the boundary of the support. In [23], with properly chosen
external ﬁelds, an example of a continuous nonneutral plasma equilibrium with
support in a torus was constructed. We also assume that ∂µ/∂e = µe < 0 inside S.
This condition is widely believed to make the equilibrium more likely to be stable
([2], [8], [28]). We study the stability of such an equilibrium under perturbations
that preserve cylindrical symmetry.

was obtained in [10] by the energy-Casimir method. Extending the calculations in

We consider solutions that are periodic in x and we may assume that there is no

instability for Vlasov systems. One of the main diﬃculties in studying Vlasov in-
stability is its collective and thus highly nonlocal nature. In the physics literature,
most classical studies ([25], [29]) treat homogeneous equilibria with vanishing elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds, in which case an explicit algebraic dispersion relation is
usually available. However, any nontrivial electromagnetic ﬁeld will make the dis-
persion relations much more diﬃcult to analyze because they depend upon some
complicated trajectory integrals. In [12] and later publications [13], [14], [15], Guo
and Strauss developed a perturbation approach to prove the instability of weakly
inhomogeneous equilibria of Vlasov-Poisson systems. They proved the instability of
various electrostatic structures that are close to an unstable homogeneous equilib-
rium. In [21] Lin developed a new non-perturbative approach to ﬁnd purely growing
modes for highly inhomogeneous equilibria of 1D Vlasov-Poisson. This approach
has recently been used ([11]) as well for galaxy models satisfying 3D Vlasov-Poisson.
There are two elements in this approach. One is to formulate a family of dispersion
operators Aλ for the electric potential, depending on a positive parameter λ. The
other is to prove the existence of a purely growing mode by ﬁnding a parameter
λ0 such that the Aλ0 has a kernel. The key observation is that these dispersion
operators are self-adjoint due to the reversibility of the particle trajectories. A con-
tinuation argument is applied to ﬁnd the parameter λ0 corresponding to a growing
mode, by comparing the spectra of Aλ for very small and large values of λ.

∂xφ, B = ∂xψ, E2 =

Let us explain the diﬃculties in extending this approach to the electromagnetic
case. We ﬁrst recall the method in [23] in the periodic 1 1
2 D case. Assuming that
the growing mode has periodic electromagnetic potentials (φ, ψ) such that E1 =
∂tψ, we express f in term of them by integrating along the
−
trajectories. Plugging f into the Maxwell system and using the condition µe < 0 to
eliminate φ, we get a self-adjoint dispersion operator for ψ alone. Then we apply
the continuation argument as in [21]. The diﬃculty with this approach is that the
equation

−

(9)

(the ﬁrst current equation of Maxwell) does not follow from the dispersion operator.
Under additional evenness assumptions in the variable x, we proved in [23] by means
of a parity argument that j1 has zero mean. Then (9) does follow from the Poisson
equation

∂tE1 =

j1

−

∂xE1 = ρ

6

and we get a growing mode.

In order to make this construction without any evenness assumption, we need
a new formulation. To do this, we express E1 =
λb where the scalar b is
introduced to account for the possible nonzero spatial average of E1 and λ is the
exponential growth rate. Once again we express f in terms of (φ, ψ, b) by integration
over the trajectories and plug it into the Maxwell system. The equation (9) can
now be handled by means of this additional number b. Again we eliminate φ using
the the condition µe < 0 and the resulting equations for ψ and b can be written in
a self-adjoint matrix operator form. We then apply the continuation argument to
this new dispersion matrix by keeping track of its negative spectrum.

The proof of Theorem 1.2 in the 3D case is much more subtle. We start with
the electric potential φ and the magnetic potential A = (Ar, Aθ, Az). Of course we
deﬁne E =
A. Our strategy is to represent f in terms
of (φ, A) and plug it into the Maxwell system to get a self-adjoint formulation for
the electromagnetic potentials. To achieve this goal as well as to satisfy the current
A = 0
equation, our key observation is to impose the Coulomb gauge condition
and use the cylindrical symmetry to deﬁne a “super-potential” π (r, z) such that
(πeθ) = (Ar, 0, Az). We then express f in terms of (φ, Aθ, π) by integrating
∇ ×
along the trajectories of the equilibrium and the external ﬁeld and then plugging
it into the Maxwell system to derive a system of equations for the three unknowns
φ, Aθ and π. The introduction of this “super-potential” π allows us to separate
the θ and (r, z) components of the current equation (40). The resulting system
for (φ, Aθ, π) indeed turns out to be self-adjoint. We then eliminate φ using the
λ for (Aθ, π),
the condition µe < 0 to get a 2
depending on a positive parameter λ.

However, this matrix operator is bounded neither from below nor from above so
the continuation argument cannot be applied directly. To handle this new diﬃculty,
we perform an n-dimensional truncation in the function space for π. The truncated
λ
matrix operator
n has entries that are high-order integro-diﬀerential operators.
It is bounded from below (by a bound depending on n), which allows us to apply
the continuation argument to get an approximate growing mode. We then let n
go to inﬁnity. The limit of this approximate growing mode is shown to satisfy the
original linearized Vlasov-Maxwell system weakly.

M

However, it is still very subtle to show that this limit indeed gives us a true
growing mode. There are two issues to clarify. The ﬁrst is to show that the limit
does not vanish, for which we need a uniform bound of the approximate growing
modes. The second issue is to show that the growth rate does not tend to zero as n
λ
go to inﬁnity. For this, we need to get uniform control of the spectrum of
n for
small λ and large n. This turns out to be quite delicate since the operators involved
merely converge to their limits weakly as λ
0. In our proof the compactness of
the support of the conﬁned plasma equilibria plays a crucial role, allowing us to get
some compactness of the operators.

M

ց

As for Theorem 1.2 (ii), the lower bound on the number of growing modes
is a corollary of the continuation argument. To get the upper bound, the key
observation is that any two growing modes are orthogonal in some sense due to a
certain invariance property proven in [23]. We note that such counting formulae
are unknown for the standard energy principles ([1], [19]) for approximate plasma

L

The new formulation and techniques developed in this paper can also be used to
detect linear instability of general Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria without the monotone
assumption µe < 0. The idea is to formulate the growing mode problem as a 3

indeﬁnite matrix dispersion operator including φ and then to use the truncation
and continuation arguments to study it. In this way we ﬁnd a suﬃcient instability
criterion by utilizing the diﬀerence of the signatures of the matrix operators at small
and large parameters. We illustrate this idea in Section 9 by getting a instability
criterion in 1 1
2 D purely magnetic case that generalizes the sharp criterion in the
monotone case.

compact support inside Sx. Let Mχ be the operator of multiplication by χ. Then

This completes the proof of Theorem 1.2 (i). To prove Theorem 1.2 (ii) on the
number of growing modes, we ﬁrst note that for each n

follows from the continuation argument that the number of approximate growing

we have the uniform control of the converging process as n
for the number of exact growing modes follows. The proof of the upper bound is

Remark 3. In this 3D case we do not have much regularity of f and the growing
mode is only shown to satisfy the linearized equation weakly. This is mainly due to
the complicated behavior of the 3D particle trajectories. To see this diﬃculty more
clearly, we formally diﬀerentiate f given by (61) and look at a typical term

If the stretching factor ∂X(s;x,v)

some regularity of f by estimating an averaged Liapunov exponent for the quantity

In case µe changes sign, it does not seem possible to extend the methods of
[23] to get linear stability. However, we can still get suﬃcient conditions for linear
instability by extending the matrix formulation of this paper. If µe changes sign,

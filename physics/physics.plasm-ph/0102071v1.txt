Abstract

We report measurements of excess electron mobility in dense Argon gas at the
two temperatures T = 152.15 and 162.30 K, fairly close to the critical one (Tc =
nm−3 (Nc = 8.08
150.7 K), as a function of the gas density N up to 14 atoms
·
nm−3). For the ﬁrst time a maximum of the zero-ﬁeld density-normalized
atoms
·
mobility µ0N has been observed at the same density where it was detected in
liquid Argon under saturated vapor pressure conditions. The existence of the µ0N
maximum in the liquid is commonly attributed to electrons scattering oﬀ long–
wavelength collective modes of the ﬂuid, while for the low–density gas a density–
modiﬁed kinetic model is valid. The presence of the µ0N maximum also in the gas
phase raises therefore the question whether the single scattering picture valid in the
gas is valid even at liquid densities.

Key words: electron mobility, kinetic theory, dense gases, multiple scattering
eﬀects, disordered systems.

1 Introduction

The study of the transport properties of excess electrons in dense non
polar gases gives important pieces of information on the nature, dynamics,
and energetics of the states of excess electrons in disordered systems.

In the neighborhood of the critical point of the liquid–vapor transition
the density can be varied in a large interval with a reasonably small change of

pressure and therefore it is relatively easy to investigate how the nature of the
electronic states evolve starting from the dilute gas regime, where the kinetic
theory is appropriate, towards the liquid regime.

The central quantity of interest is the electron mobility µ. It is deﬁned
as the ratio of the mean velocity vD, acquired by an electron drifting in the
medium under the action of an externally applied and uniform electric ﬁeld,
µ, is
and the strength of the ﬁeld E : µ = vD/E. Its zero–ﬁeld limit, µ0 = lim
E→0
related to the fundamental properties of the e
atom interaction. In the low
density regime, the kinetic theory relates µ0 to the electron–atom momentum
transfer scattering cross section σmt according to the following equation [1]

where N is the number density of the gas. e and m are the electron charge
and mass, respectively. T is the gas temperature and ǫ the electron energy.
µ0N is the zero–ﬁeld density–normalized mobility.

For a given electron–atom cross section, Eq. (1) predicts that µ0N depends
only on the gas temperature and is independent of the gas density. In contrast
with the prediction of the classical kinetic theory [1], the electron mobility
shows a strong dependence on the density of the medium [2]. It is therefore
important to study the eﬀect of the environment on the electron–atom scat-
tering mechanisms in a relatively dense phase.

Large deviations from the classical prediction, called anomalous density
eﬀects, have been observed even in the simplest systems represented by the
noble gases [2]. In gases, such as He [3] and Ne [4,5], where the short–range
repulsive exchange forces dominate the electron–atom interaction, there is a
negative density eﬀect, namely, µ0N decreases with increasing N and even-
tually drops rapidly to very low values because of the formation of localized
electron states at high enough densities and in the liquid [6,7].

−

The situation in Ar is diﬀerent. Here, the e

atom scattering at low en-
ergies is essentially determined by the long–range attractive polarization in-
teraction because the atomic polarizability of Ar is quite large. Owing to this
feature, µ0N shows a positive density eﬀect, i.e., it increases with increasing N
[8]. A further relevant feature of Ar and of the heavier noble gases is that in the
liquid the electron mobility has a value comparable to that in the crystalline
state [9]. It is commonly believed that this characteristics of the mobility is
due to the existence, also in the liquid, of a conduction band. Therefore, it
is interesting to investigate, as a function of the density of the medium, the
transition from the classical single scattering situation in the dilute gas to the

2

multiple scattering scenario at higher densities and the eventual formation of
extended (or localized) electron states in the liquid.

The explanation of the diﬀerent density eﬀects in the mobility is commonly
based on the realization that the average interatomic distance at high densities
becomes comparable to the electron de Broglie wavelength λ. In this situation,
the conditions for single scattering break down and quantum eﬀects become
important. Moreover, also the mean free path ℓ becomes comparable to λ and
multiple scattering eﬀects come into play, too [2].

Recent and accurate measurements of mobility in Ne [4,5] and Ar [10,11]
have put into evidence that the diﬀerent behavior of the mobility in diﬀerent
gases can be rationalized into an uniﬁed picture, where all the multiple scat-
tering eﬀects are taken into account in a heuristic way. A model (henceforth
known as the BSL model) has been developed that incorporates all features
of the several models proposed to interpret the diﬀerent density eﬀects and
merges the several multiple scattering eﬀects into the single scattering picture
of kinetic theory [10].

Three main multiple scattering eﬀects have been identiﬁed and all of them
stem from the fact that the electron mean free path becomes comparable to
its wavelength and that the latter may also become larger than the average
interatomic distance if the density is large enough. The ﬁrst eﬀect is a density–
dependent quantum shift V0(N) of the ground state energy of an excess elec-
tron immersed in the medium. According to the SJC model [12] V0(N), can
be written as

V0(N) = UP (N) + Ek(N)

(2)

UP is a potential energy contribution arising from the screened polarization
interaction of the electron with the surrounding atoms. Ek(N) is a kinetic
energy term, essentially due to excluded volume eﬀects because the volume
accessible to electrons shrinks as the density is increased. Owing to its nature,
Ek is positive and increases with increasing N. An expression for it is obtained
by imposing on the electron ground–state wave function the conditions of
average traslational simmetry about the equivalent Wigner–Seitz (WS) cell
centered about each atom of the gas. V0 may be either > 0 (this is the case
of He [13] and Ne [14]) or < 0 (as for Ar [15,16]), depending on the relative
sizes of UP and Ek. However, the experimental mobility results indicate that
only the kinetic energy term Ek has to be added to the true electron kinetic
energy when the scattering properties (namely, the cross sections) have to be
calculated. Diﬀerently stated, the bottom of the electron energy distribution
function is shifted by the amount Ek [5].

The second multiple scattering eﬀect is an enhancement of electron backscat-

3

tering due to quantum self–interference of the electron wave function scattered
oﬀ atoms located along paths which are connected by time–reversal simmetry
[17]. This phenomenon is closely related to the weak localization regime of the
electronic conduction in disordered solids and to the Anderson localization
transition [18]. It depends on the ratio of the electron wavelength to its mean
free path λ/ℓ = Nσmtλ. For Ar, at the density of the experiments, Nσmtλ < 1.
Therefore, a linearized treatment of this eﬀect due to Atrazhev et al. can be
adopted [19]. The net result is that the scattering cross section is enhanced
by the factor (1 + Nσmtλ/π).

Finally, the third multiple scattering eﬀect is due to correlations among
scatterers. The electron wave packet encompasses a region containing several
atoms, especially at low temperature and high density, and is scattered oﬀ all of
them simultaneously. The total scattered wave packet is obtained by summing
up coherently all partial scattering amplitudes contributed by each atoms. The
net result is that the cross section is weighted by the static structure factor of
the ﬂuid which is related to the gas isothermal compressibility [20].

In the density–modiﬁed kinetic model (BSL model) [10], the density–nor-
malized mobility is calculated according to the classical kinetic theory equa-
tions [1] with the modiﬁcations necessary to take into account the mentioned
multiple scattering eﬀects

The BSL model has been successfully used to analyze the experimental
nm−3 [11] by assuming that for
data in Ar at T = 152.5 K up to N
10 atoms
the highest densities the WS model for the calculation of Ek is inappropriate
and Ek must be deduced from the experiment.

≈

·

It is natural to ask if the reason of the deviation of the experimentally de-
termined Ek values from the WS model is that the BSL model has been used
beyond its limits of applicability, or if diﬀerent mechanisms become active for
momentum transfer processes at high N. It is known, in fact, that in liquid Ar
the mobility of thermal electrons shows a maximum not very distant from the
highest density investigated in previous experiments [11]. The mobility maxi-
mum occurs practically at the same density where V0(N) has a minimum [15].
The existence of this maximum, that indicates a situation of minimum scat-
tering, has been interpreted within the deformation–potential theory [25,26].

Intrinsic density ﬂuctuations of the ﬂuid modulate the energy V0 at the bottom
of the conduction band. The spatial disuniformity of the ground–state energy
of electrons is the source of scattering. This is an intrinsic multiple–scattering
theory because electrons are scattered oﬀ long–wavelength collective modes
of the ﬂuid. These sorts of phononic models [25–27] do correctly predict the
nm−3,
existence of the mobility maximum at the right value N
but they fail to predict the density- and electric ﬁeld dependence of the µN
data as the BSL model does.

·

Owing to these reasons, we have investigated an extended density range
nm−3, well
in Ar at T = 152.15 K up to a maximum density N = 14 atoms
above the density of the mobility maximum in liquid, in order to see if the
mobility maximum is a feature typical of the liquid only or if it appears also
in the gas. In the latter case, there would be sound motivations to extend the
density-modiﬁed kinetic approach even to the liquid [28–30].

2 Experimental Details

The electron mobility measurements have been carried out by using the
well–known pulsed photoemission technique [5,31]. A swarm of electrons drifts
in the gas under the action of an externally applied uniform electric ﬁeld. The
time τe spent by the particles crossing the drift distance d is measured and the
drift velocity is calculated as vD = d/τe. The mobility is simply obtained as µ =
vD/E, where E is the strength of the electric ﬁeld. A simpliﬁed schematics of
the experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A high–pressure cell is mounted
on the cold head of a cryocooler inside a triple–shield thermostat. The cell
can be operated in the range 25 < T < 330 K and its temperature can be
0.01 K. The cell can withstand pressures up to 10 MPa and
stabilized within
the pressure P is measured with an accuracy of
1 kPa. The gas density N
is calculated from T and P by means of an accurate equation of state [32].

A parallel–plate capacitor is contained in the cell and is powered by a D.C.
high–voltage generator [33]. A gold–coated fused silica window is placed in the
4 µs)
center of one of the plates and can be irradiated with a short pulse (
of VUV light produced by a Xe ﬂashlamp. Thus, a bunch of electrons, whose
number ranges between 4 and 400 fC depending on the gas pressure and on
the applied electric ﬁeld strength, is photoinjected into the drift space. During
the drift motion of the charges towards the anode a current is induced in the
external circuit. In order to improve the signal–to–noise ratio the current is
integrated by a passive RC network. The resulting voltage signal is ampliﬁed
and recorded by a digital oscilloscope. The drift time is obtained by analyzing
the signal waveform with a personal computer. Typical signal waveforms are
shown in Fig. 2. The estimated error on the mobility is less than 5 %.

3 Experimental Results and Discussion

We have carried out measurements at two diﬀerent temperatures in the
neighborhood of the critical temperature, namely, at T = 162.30 K and T =
152.15 K (Tc = 150.7 K). We have investigated the dependence of the density–
normalized mobility µN as a function of the density–reduced electric ﬁeld
strength E/N and of the density N. The density range explored encompasses
nm−3. In Fig. 3 we show sample µN

T = 162.7 K [10]. The data for T = 152.15 K are qualitatively similar to those
shown in Fig. 3.

The behavior of the reduced mobility µN of excess electrons in Ar as a
function of the reduced electric ﬁeld is quite complicated, although it is now
nm−3) [10]. At
well understood for not too high densities (N < 7.0 atoms
low ﬁeld strength µN is a constant independent of E/N. This constant value
is the zero–ﬁeld density–normalized mobility µ0N and pertains to thermal
electrons. In fact, at such low ﬁelds, the energy gained by electrons from
the ﬁeld is negligible in comparison with their thermal energy. According to
the prediction of the classical kinetic theory [1], µ0N should be constant and
independent of N, while, experimentally, a completely diﬀerent behavior of
µ0N is observed, as it is easily realized by observing Fig. 3.

E/N

At small and medium N, µN displays a maximum as a function of E/N
10−24 V m2, whose position depends on the
in the range (2
density. Since the maximum is observed from the dilute gas up to the present
densities, it is obvious that it has to be attributed to the Ramsauer–Townsend
minimum of the e
Ar atomic momentum–transfer scattering cross section,
230 meV [35,36]. When E/N
which is located at an electron energy ǫRT ≈
has the value (E/N)max corresponding to the mobility maximum, the average
= ǫRT .
electron energy is equal to the energy of the Ramsauer minimum
For larger N, the mobility maximum at (E/N)max gradually disappears.

Finally, for even larger E/N

10−24 V m2, the µN curves for all
4
densities merge into a single curve that is well described by the classical kinetic
equations with the given cross section. For large E/N, the behavior of µN
becomes therefore independent of density and is easily explained in terms
of the BSL model. At low E/N, i.e., at small electron energies ǫ, the de
Broglie wavelength of the electron, λ = h/√2mǫ, is pretty large and the
electron wavepacket is so much extended as to encompass many atoms at
once. In this situation, multiple scattering eﬀects are very important. As the
is increased by increasing E/N, the extension of the
mean electron energy
electron wave function, as measured by λ, decreases and the importance of
multiple scattering is reduced. Therefore, the experimental points converge to
the prediction of the classical kinetic theory. This behavior is present also in
the liquid [11] and has been observed also in Neon gas [5], where the energy
dependence of the cross section is completely diﬀerent from that of Ar and
where the temperature of the experiment (T
45 K) was much lower than in
the present case.

As already observed for several temperatures [10,11], the mobility max-
imum related to the Ramsauer minimum of the cross section shifts to lower
E/N values as the density is increased, as shown in Fig. 4, where the re-
duced ﬁeld of the mobility maximum, (E/N)max, is plotted as a function of
N for T = 152.15 K. This behavior is also consistent with previous measure-
nm−3
ments in gaseous Ar at room temperature for densities up to 2 atoms

disappears, as can be seen in Fig. 3.

where f (E/N) is a monotonically increasing function of the reduced electric
ﬁeld [22]. Since the density–dependent electron kinetic energy shift Ek(N)
increases with increasing N, (E/N)max must decrease in order to fulﬁll the
= ǫRT with increasing N at constant temperature. [We will
condition
furthermore show that the change of slope of (E/N)max as a function of N for
nm−3 is related to the change of slope of Ek(N) at the same
N > 6.0 atoms
density.] Eventually, for N > Nc, the electron energy distribution function is
so largely shifted by Ek as to sample the scattering cross section well beyond
the Ramsauer–Townsend minimum. This is the reason of the disappearing of
the mobility maximum.

·

A cornerstone for the understanding of the electron scattering in dense
gases is represented by the analysis of behavior of the zero–ﬁeld density–
normalized mobility µ0N as a function of the density, because, as already
pointed out, the classical kinetic theory predicts that µ0N is independent of
N, while the experiment gives a strongly density–dependent µ0N for every
explored temperature. In Fig. 5 we therefore show the zero–ﬁeld density–
normalized mobility µ0N as a function of N for the two investigated temper-
atures T = 162.30 K and T = 152.15 K. Previous data taken at T = 162.7 K
with a diﬀerent apparatus [10] are reported in order to show the consistency
of the present data. Moreover, also data obtained in liquid Ar [11] are shown
for comparison, although it must be remembered that the measurements in
the liquid are taken along the liquid-vapor coexistence line and are therefore
not isothermal.

sive increase of µ0N with increasing N for both temperatures up to N

tering theories. The BSL model explains quantitatively this feature of µ0N for
N

the host gas and do not gain energy from the ﬁeld. Therefore, their average

owing to the shape of σmt(ǫ), µ0N can increase with increasing N only if

clusion that the average electron kinetic energy includes a density–dependent
contribution that is positive and increases with increasing N, as expressed
by Eq. 9. This conclusion immediately rationalizes the observations described
by Christophorou et al. [34]. In fact, they note that the minimum of the in-
verse density–normalized mobility at zero–ﬁeld, i.e. a quantity proportional
to the cross section, shifts to lower energies as the density is increased. They
calculate the average electron energy at zero ﬁeld according to the Nernst–

where DL is the longitudinal diﬀusion coeﬃcient. By so doing, they neglect
the density–dependent zero–point electron energy Ek(N), and therefore the
Ramsauer–Townsend minimum seemingly appears at lower energies, as can be
seen by inspecting Eq. 9 with E/N = 0, i.e.(f (E/N) = 0), and by neglecting

The second most relevant feature is the presence of a sharp maximum of
nm−3 at T = 152.15 K. [Probably, such max-
µ0N for N
Nm ≈
imum would exist also at the higher temperature, but the limited pressure
range of the experimental cell (P
10.0 MPa) did not allow the investiga-
tion of larger densities at higher temperatures.] The µ0N maximum occurs
at nearly the same density where it was observed in liquid Ar [11], as also
shown in Fig. 5. A similar behavior has been previously observed in liquid
and gaseous CH4 [37].

≤

It is well–known [25,27] that the maximum of µ0N in liquid has been
attributed to scattering of electrons oﬀ long-wavelength collective modes of
the ﬂuid. The intrinsic density ﬂuctuations of the liquid modulate the elec-
tron energy at the bottom of the conduction band of the liquid, V0(N), and
the spatial ﬂuctuations of V0(N) act as the potential for the scattering, just
as lattice deformation–potentials from acoustic phonons scatter carriers in
semiconductors. Within the deformation potential theory, the potential for
scattering is linear in the density deviations about the average value. Since it
happens that V0(N) has a minimum at nearly the same density, Nm, where
µ0N is maximum [15], the scattering potential vanishes to ﬁrst order at Nm.
Therefore, at this density the scattering of electrons is very much reduced and
the electron mobility turns out to be maximal. For any other N
= Nm, the
slope of V0(N) as a function of N is nonzero and deformation potential is large

12

enough to eﬃciently scatter electrons, thus reducing their mobility.

However, a gas does not support phonons as a liquid does. Therefore, the
presence of the µ0N maximum in dense Ar gas at the same density Nm as
in the liquid raises the question if, beyond a given density threshold, there
is a change in the physical mechanisms which determine the mobility in the
gas, or, rather, if the single scattering picture of the density–modiﬁed kinetic
theory can be extended to the liquid.

On one hand, one could argue that, at low and medium densities, the single
scatterer approximation is valid and electrons can be described as scattering
oﬀ individual atoms, though the scattering properties have to be density–
modiﬁed in order to account for multiple scattering eﬀects. On increasing the
density, a conduction band might develop and electrons might be scattered oﬀ
long–wavelength collective modes of the dense gas, though they might not be
true phonons.

On the other hand, there are several reasons to extend the single scattering
picture to the liquid. First of all, the phononic theories are developed for
thermal electrons only, i.e., they make predictions only on µ0N and completely
disregard the electric ﬁeld dependence of the experimental µN data. This
dependence is very important because it is intimately related to the shape
of the atomic cross section. There have indeed been more or less successful
attempts to use the classical kinetic theory even in the liquid [28–30], though
the cross section has been taken as an adjustable parameter. Moreover, the
phononic models do not even predict accurately µ0N, unless higher–order
scattering processes are taken into account [26,27].

It is therefore challenging to investigate the possibility that the density–
modiﬁed kinetic model can account for the µ0N maximum and that a single–
scattering picture can be retained even in the liquid, owing to its conceptual
simplicity. The BSL model has been thus used for the analysis of the experi-
mental data at high density.

First of all, we do not make any assumptions on the value of the kinetic
energy shift Ek(N). We treat it as an adjustable parameter to be determined
by ﬁtting the equations of the model Eqns. 3–5 in the limit E/N
0 to
the experimental data. Literature data for the cross section have been used
[35]. Once Ek(N) has been determined by this ﬁtting procedure, the average
electron energy (Eq. 9) could be evaluated, if necessary, as

Previous determinations of Ek for T = 162.7 K [10] are also shown for compar-
ison to assess the consistency of these new sets of measurements with previous
ones.

The data at T = 162.30 K agree very well with the data taken at T = 162.7
K. There are small diﬀerences between the results for T = 152.15 K and
T = 162.30 K, which might be attributed to the larger gas compressibility for
the temperature close to Tc and to the uncertainty with which the short–range
correlation length l is known [23]. Nonetheless, the experimentally determined
Ek values agree pretty well with the prediction of the WS model (shown as
nm−3. For larger N,

starting at practically the same density where (E/N)max changes slope (see
nm−3, the values of Ek that reproduce the
Fig. 4), up to N
experimental values of µ0N increase faster with N than the prediction of the
WS model. This is not a failure of the BSL model. It is just related to the
˜a. Unfortunately, up to now
fact that the WS model is only valid when rs ≫
there are no theoretical calculations of Ek with which the present results can
be compared.

are compared with the prediction of the BSL model (dotted lines). The dot-
ted curves are obtained by using the Ek(N) values determined by ﬁtting the
model to the zero–ﬁeld data. It can be realized that, at small and medium
N, the features of the mobility are all reproduced well. Namely, the position
and strength of the mobility maximum as well as its behavior as a function of
the density are described accurately. The behavior at small– and high–ﬁelds
of µN is correctly reproduced, with the curves for diﬀerent densities merging
into a single one at large E/N. All these observations are consistent with the
hypothesis that the kinetic–energy shift Ek(N) increases with increasing N,
and that it can grow so large as to shift the average electron energy beyond
ǫRT .

However, it is also evident that, for even larger N (

nm−3), the
BSL model as such does neither reproduce the µ0N maximum for N = Nm,
nor the decrease of µ0N with increasing N for N > Nm. On one hand, it is
clear, of course, that the overall behavior of µ0N as a function of N must be
related to the shape of the atomic cross section and to the density–dependent
quantum shift of the electron energy distribution function. Unfortunately, the
scattering cross sections are known with limited accuracy as far as strength

and position of the Ramsauer minimum are concerned. Diﬀerent choices of σmt
give diﬀerent strength and position of the µ0N maximum [11] or they may not
even give a maximum at all.

On the other hand, the use of an eﬀective density–modiﬁed scattering
cross section σ⋆
mt has proven so powerful giving a nice agreement between
model and data up to fairly large densities that it is interesting to extend this
paradigm to higher densities. According to a suggestion proposed in literature
[11,28], at high N a good agreement between data and model can be obtained
by scaling σ⋆
mt by a factor c0(N). The adjustable parameter c0 depends only
on N, but it is independent of E/N and of the electron energy. Therefore, it
has no inﬂuence on the dependence of µN on E/N at constant density. While
c0 is introduced as an adjustable parameter, the energy shift Ek is no longer
determined from the experimental data. Instead of Ek it is rather used the
value EW S given by the WS model and calculated according to Eq. 8 (solid

4 Conclusions

In this paper measurements of the excess electron mobility in dense Ar gas
in the neighborhood of the liquid–vapor critical point are presented. The most
important result of the present experiment is the observation of a sharp max-
imum of the zero–ﬁeld density–normalized mobility µ0N at the same density
where it occurs in the liquid.

The interpretation of these measurements is challenging because two op-
posite points of views must be reconciled. In fact, in the low–density gas it is
customary to adopt a single scattering picture, while in the dense liquid the
electron transport properties are described in terms of scattering of electrons
oﬀ collective excitations of the medium. The interesting point is to under-
stand if the physical mechanisms underlying the scattering processes gradu-
ally change at some density between the dilute gas and the dense liquid or
if the kinetic picture valid at low density can be still retained, with obvious
modiﬁcations so as to include multiple scattering, also in the liquid phase.

To this goal, the present data have been analyzed by extending the heuris-
tic model proposed by Borghesani et al. to explain the mobility measurements
in moderately dense Ar gas [10]. The model is a density–modiﬁed kinetic model
based on the classical kinetic theory [1], where density–dependent multiple–
scattering eﬀects are included in a heuristic way. The model is based on the
quantum density-dependent shift of the ground state energy of the electrons
in a dense and disordered medium, on the accounting for correlations among
scatterers described by the static structure factor of the medium, and on the
quantum self–interference of the electron wavepacket scattered oﬀ randomly
located scattering centers along paths connected by time–reversal. The kinetic
term of the ground state energy shift must be added to the usual kinetic en-
ergy of the electrons when the cross section and other dynamic properties of

17

scattering have to be evaluated. All these eﬀects concur to dress the atomic
cross section resulting in an eﬀective density–dependent momentum transfer
cross section, that nonetheless is intimately related to the atomic one.

Although the data for quite high densities ﬁt well in this model, the
description of the newly discovered feature, namely the mobility maximum,
requires the introduction of a density–dependent adjustable parameter that
scales the cross section. In any case, however, the kinetic picture is preserved
and the resulting eﬀective cross section turns out to be very similar to the
atomic one. In particular, it shows a Ramsauer–type minimum.

The overall success of this kinetic description is striking, even more if one
takes into account the limited accuracy with which the atomic cross section
is known, especially in the region of the Ramsauer minimum, and the uncer-
(ǫ) is known,
tainty with which the energy–dependent structure function
particularly in the neighborhood of the critical point. It also appears that
more reﬁned theoretical calculations of the kinetic energy shift at high density
are needed, as well as a treatment of the eﬀect of the density ﬂuctuations on
the electron energy distribution function.

F

Moreover, these data still raise the question of how to treat theoretically
the scattering processes for momentum transfer at very large densities, possi-
bly including contributions from mechanisms diﬀerent from density–modiﬁed
kinetic processes.

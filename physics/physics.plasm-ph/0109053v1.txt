The variational formulation for Lie-transform Hamiltonian perturbation theory is pre-
sented in terms of an action functional deﬁned on a two-dimensional parameter space.
A fundamental equation in Hamiltonian perturbation theory is shown to result from the
freedom of choice of the integration path for the action functional.

The paradigm of canonical Hamiltonian perturbation theory [1, 2] involves the transfor-
mation of an exact Hamiltonian Hǫ, which depends continuously on a perturbation param-
eter ǫ, into a reference Hamiltonian H0 for which the Hamilton equations ∂tz = {z, H0}
have a known solution (unless otherwise noted z denotes canonical phase-space coordinates
and { , } denotes the canonical Poisson bracket). According to the Lie-transform approach
to Hamiltonian perturbation theory [1], the transformation Hǫ → H0 is induced by a re-
versible (time-dependent) phase-space transformation from the old phase-space coordinates
z to the new phase-space coordinates Zǫ = Tǫ z, where Tǫ is an operator deﬁned in terms
of a generating scalar ﬁeld Sǫ as

Tǫ ≡ exp

{Sσ, } dσ

.

(cid:18)Z

For a time-dependent phase-space transformation z → Zǫ generated by the scalar ﬁeld
Sǫ(z, t), the transformation from the old Hamiltonian Hǫ to the new Hamiltonian H0 is
expressed as [2, 3]

H0(Zǫ, t) ≡ Hǫ(z, t) −

ǫ

0
Z

∂Sσ(z, t)

dσ.

The transformations z → Zǫ and Hǫ → H0 are therefore completely determined by the
perturbed Hamiltonian Hǫ(z, t) and the phase-space generating function Sǫ(z, t). Since
H0 is independent of ǫ by construction (i.e., ∂ǫH0 ≡ 0), the ǫ-derivative of both sides
in (1) yields a dynamical evolution (henceforth known as the Lie-transform perturbation
equation)

∂tS + {S, H} = ∂ǫH,

where the parametric ǫ-dependence is included with the time dependence. The ǫ-perturbed
Hamilton equations, on the other hand, are now expressed as

and

∂zα(t, ǫ)
∂t

∂zα(t, ǫ)
∂ǫ

≡ {zα, H(z; t, ǫ)} ,

≡ {zα, S(z; t, ǫ)} .

Hence, whereas the Hamiltonian H is the generating function for the inﬁnitesimal canonical
transformations associated with the dynamical evolution (3) of the Hamiltonian system
(henceforth referred to as the t-dynamics), the generating function S is the Hamiltonian
for the perturbation evolution (4) of the Hamiltonian system (henceforth referred to as
the ǫ-dynamics). We note that the order with which the Hamiltonian system is evolved
and perturbed should be immaterial, i.e., the same dynamical state z(t, ǫ) ≡ zǫ(t) can
be reached by either evolving the unperturbed system ﬁrst [z0(t = 0) → z0(t)] and then
perturbing it [z0(t) → zǫ(t)] or perturbing the system ﬁrst [z0(t = 0) → zǫ(t = 0)] and
then evolving it [zǫ(t = 0) → zǫ(t)].

The purpose of this Letter is to the variational formulation for the Lie-transform per-
turbation equation (2) and the multi-Hamilton equations (3) and (4). In particular, we
show that the Lie-transform perturbation equation (2) is a direct consequence of path in-
dependence in our variational formulation. First, we introduce an extended phase-space
Lagrangian Γ on the (t, ǫ)-plane deﬁned as

Γ(Z(t, ǫ); t, ǫ) ≡ P(t, ǫ) · dQ(t, ǫ) − H(Z(t, ǫ); t, ǫ) dt − S(Z(t, ǫ); t, ǫ) dǫ,

(5)

where

Z α :

(t, ǫ) 7→ Z α(t, ǫ) ≡ (Q(t, ǫ), P(t, ǫ))

(6)

is a mapping from the (t, ǫ)-plane to the 2N-dimensional phase space, with

dZ α(t, ǫ) ≡

∂Z α(t, ǫ)
∂t

dt +

∂Z α(t, ǫ)
∂ǫ

dǫ.

The one-form (5) is said to be extended in the sense that the ǫ-dynamics Hamiltonian term
− S dǫ has been added to the standard phase-space Lagrangian P · dQ − H dt. Next, we
deﬁne the action integral

AC[Z] ≡

Γ(Z(t, ǫ); t, ǫ),

ZC

(7)

where C denotes an arbitrary path between two (distinct) points on the two-dimensional
(t, ǫ)-plane. For a ﬁxed path C, the action integral AC[Z] is a functional of the mapping
(6). Holding C ﬁxed, we ﬁrst consider the variational principle δAC[z] = 0 corresponding
to an arbitrary variation δZ ≡ Z − z (which is assumed to vanish at the end points of C).
Using Eqs. (5) and (7), we thus ﬁnd

δAC[z] =

ωαβ dzβ −

(8)

where the second path integral vanishes since we assumed that δZ vanishes at the end
points of C; here, ωαβ denotes the components of the canonical Lagrange tensor (i.e.,
dpi ∧ dqi = 1
2 ωαβ dzα ∧ dzβ). The multi-Hamilton equations (3) and (4) are automatically
recovered in Euler-Lagrange form as ωαβ dzβ = ∂αH dt + ∂αS dǫ from the variational
principle δAC[z] = 0 for arbitrary variations δZ and an arbitrary path C.

In the standard variational principle for single-particle Hamiltonian dynamics [3], the
action functional involves a time integration of the phase-space Lagrangian P · dQ − H dt
from an initial time t1 to a ﬁnal time t2; the initial and ﬁnal times play no role and the
variational principle yields the standard Hamilton equations. The variational principle
based on the action functional (7) presents us with a new problem: determining how the
freedom of choice in selecting the path C on the (t, ǫ)-plane is expressed mathematically.
To resolve this problem, we ﬁrst consider two diﬀerent paths C and C ′, both having the
same end points, and we choose the mapping (6) to be a multi-Hamiltonian orbit z(t, ǫ),

i.e., a solution of Eqs. (3) and (4). Next, according to Stokes’ theorem [4], the diﬀerence
between AC[z] and AC′[z] is evaluated as

AC[z] − AC′[z] =

Γ ≡

dΓ,

IC−C′

where D denotes the area in the (t, ǫ)-plane enclosed by the two paths C and C ′ (i.e.,
C − C ′ ≡ ∂D denotes the contour of D). Using Eqs. (3)-(5), the two-form dΓ appearing in
Eq. (9) is

dΓ(t, ǫ; z(t, ǫ)) ≡ dǫ ∧ dt

From Eq. (9), we see that, for a ﬁxed Hamiltonian orbit z(t, ǫ), the condition for the path-
independence of the action integral AC[z] (i.e., AC[z] = AC′[z]) is dΓ = 0. From Eq. (10),
we see that this condition holds provided H and S satisfy the following constraint equation:

which is exactly the Lie-transform perturbation equation (2) appearing in Lie-transform
Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We can also verify by using the operators deﬁned in (11)
and the Jacobi identity for the Poisson bracket that the constraint (12) ensures that the
ﬂows associated with t-dynamics and ǫ-dynamics commute:

for all g(z; t, ǫ). As expected the interpretation of the commutation relation (13) is that
the order with which the Hamiltonian system is evolved (under the t-dynamics) and is
perturbed (under the ǫ-dynamics) is indeed immaterial.

So far we have presented the variational formulation of Lie-transform canonical Hamil-
tonian perturbation theory. Most recent applications of Hamiltonian perturbation theory
in plasma physics are carried out using non-canonical phase-space coordinates [5, 6]. Non-
canonical Lie-transform Hamiltonian perturbation theory possesses a variational formula-
tion expressed in terms of the extended non-canonical phase-space Lagrangian

This non-canonical Hamiltonian perturbation equation plays a prominent role in the deriva-
tion of the reduced nonlinear gyrokinetic equations describing the perturbed Hamiltonian
dynamics of charged particles under the inﬂuence of low-frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctu-
ations in a magnetized plasma [6].

Finally, we note that the variational formulation for Lie-transform Hamiltonian pertur-
bation theory can be generalized to include several perturbation parameters. Consider the
(k + 1)-component perturbation vector ǫ ≡ (ǫ0, ǫ1, ..., ǫk), where each perturbation parame-
ter ǫa is paired with a Hamiltonian Sa (with ǫ0 ≡ t and S0 ≡ H). Hence, the multi-Hamilton
equations (3) and (4) are now replaced by the set of multi-Hamilton equations:

∂zα(ǫ)
∂ǫa = {zα, Sa(z; ǫ)} ,

where a = 0, 1, ..., k. We now deﬁne the action functional AC[Z] ≡
of a path C in the (k + 1)-dimensional ǫ-space and the one-form:

C Γ(Z(ǫ); ǫ) in terms
R

Γ(Z(ǫ); ǫ) ≡ P(ǫ) · dQ(ǫ) − Sa(Z(ǫ); ǫ) dǫa.

For a ﬁxed (but arbitrary) path C, we recover the multi-Hamilton equations (17) from the
variational principle δ AC[z] = 0. In addition, for a ﬁxed multi-Hamiltonian orbit z(ǫ), the
(k + 1) equations corresponding to the condition for the path-independence of AC[z] (i.e.,
dΓ = 0) are

∂aSb − ∂bSa = {Sa, Sb}.

Note that this set of equations is invariant under the gauge transformation:

p → p +

and Sa → Sa −

∂χ
∂q

∂χ
∂ǫa ,

where χ(q; ǫ) is an arbitrary scalar ﬁeld. Under the gauge transformation, the one-form
(18) transforms as Γ → Γ + dχ. The gauge properties of the generating function S are
further elucidated in Ref. [7].

The work presented here introduced a variational formulation for Lie-transform Hamil-
tonian perturbation theory. This work follows recent developments in the variational for-
mulation of exact and reduced Vlasov-Maxwell equations [7, 8, 9] as well as other important
dynamical ﬁeld equations in plasma physics (e.g., kinetic-MHD equations [7] and drift-wave
equations [10]).

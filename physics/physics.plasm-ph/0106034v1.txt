1 Introduction

The stopping power (SP), which is a measure of energy loss of energetic charged
particles in a target medium, is of continuing theoretical and experimental interest
in diverse areas such as interaction of charged particles with solids (see [1-4]
for reviews) and beam-heating of fusion plasma [5]. For high-velocity projectile
particles or clusters, the energy loss may be mainly due to collective and single-
particle excitations in the target medium.
It is of fundamental and practical
interest to study the extent to which the collective and single-particle excitations
each contribute to SP. This is the objective of our work reported here.

The energy loss of a high velocity projectile is formulated, originally due
to Lindhard [6], on the justiﬁable assumption of a weak coupling between the
particle and a target medium which is modelled by a degenerate electron gas
(DEG), through the linear response function of the DEG. The corresponding di-
electric function ǫ(k, ω) contains contributions from both collective excitations
(plasmons) and single-particle excitations. For a single point-ion projectile Lind-
hard and Winther (LW) [7] investigated the respective contributions of these two
excitations and found a sum rule which states that both these excitations con-
tribute equally to SP. To our knowledge this type of sum rule has not yet been
studied for an extended-charge projectile or a cluster. In this paper we formulate
a generalized stopping power sum rule, again in the linear response approach,
and present mostly analytical results for a He+ ion and for a diproton cluster as
projectiles. We compare and contrast our results with those of LW.

In linear response theory, the stopping power (SP) which is the energy loss per
unit length for an external projectile with a spatial charge distribution ρext(r, t) =
Qext(r − Vt) moving with velocity V in a homogeneous isotropic medium char-
acterized by the dielectric function ε(k, ω), is given by (see, e.g., [3])

S =

where G(k) is the Fourier transform of the stationary charge Qext(r).

Eq.

(1) is applicable to any external charge distribution.

II we
discuss a dicluster of two identical He+ ions separated by a variable distance R.
The spatial distribution of bound electrons in the ions, ρ(r), is assumed to be
spherically symmetric. We use a 1s-type wave function of the form ψ1s(r) =
0)1/2 e−Zr/a0, to describe the bound electron on each He+ ion, with a0 =
(Z 3/πa3
0.529 ˚A as the Bohr radius. Ze is the charge on each of the point-like nuclei
(Z = 2). It may be remarked that we are considering an unscreened 1s electron.
For the projectile systems under study we may write G(k) as

In Sec.

G(k) = e [Z − ρ(k)] [1 + exp (−ik · R)] ,
(2)
where ρ(k) is the Fourier transform of ρ(r) = |ψ1s(r)|2. G(k) contains R as a

parameter.

For a dicluster of He+ ions the SP of a dicluster can be written as [3]

where A = (2u/λ) kF R, and B = 2kF R
stand for individual and correlated SP, respectively. J0(x) is the Bessel function
of ﬁrst kind and zero order and ϑ is the angle between the interionic separation
vector R and the velocity vector V; λ = V /vF , χ2 = 1/πkF a0 = (4/9π4)1/3 rs,
0)1/3. n0 is the electron gas density, vF and kF are the Fermi

velocity and wave number of the target electrons respectively. In our calculations
χ (or rs) serves as a measure of electron density. Here, as in Refs.
[2-4,6,7],
we have introduced the following notations z = k/2kF , u = ω/kvF .
In these
variables Z(z) = Z − ρ(z) and the Fourier transform of the spatial distribution
ρ(r) is expressed as

(3)

(4)

ρ(z) =

α4
(z2 + α2)2 ,

where α = πχ2Z.

In Eq. (3) the term for correlated stopping power Scorr vanishes for large R
(R → ∞) and SP is the sum of individual stopping powers for the separate ions.
For R → 0 the two ions coalesce into a single entity. Then Scorr = Sind and SP is
that for a total charge 2e(Z − 1).

We will consider the interaction process of a dicluster in a fully degenerate
(T = 0) electron gas. For this purpose we use the exact random-phase approxi-
mation (RPA) dielectric response function due to Lindhard [6],

.

Here, kn is the wave vector of the electron in the nth state. The distribution
function f (kn) is an even function of kn, and normalized so that N =
n f (kn)
is the total number of electrons. In the case of a fully degenerate free electron
gas with Fermi energy EF = ~2k2
F /2m the distribution function is f (kn) = 1 for
kn < kF , and f (kn) = 0 for kn > kF .

P

The summation in Eq.

(5) can be analytically performed, leading to the
characteristic logarithmic expression in ε(z, u) ﬁrst obtained by Lindhard [6].

However, in our further consideration it is convenient to use the form (5) for the
dielectric function. This allows a wider investigation of the analytical properties
of ε(z, u) in the complex z plane with applications toward deriving some useful
sum rules.

2 Equipartition sum rule

In this section we shall discuss some important properties of the SP integrals,
which we call stopping power summation rules (SPSR). In the literature two
such sum rules have been widely considered−the familiar Bethe sum rule and
the Lindhard-Winther (LW) equipartition rule (see [7]). While the Bethe sum
rule concerns the integral of 1/ε(z, u) over ω (or u) for ﬁxed k (or z), the LW
equipartition rule concerns the integral of 1/ε(z, u) over z for ﬁxed u. The latter
summation rule states that an integral of the form

(6)

receives equal contributions, ℑp(u) and ℑsp(u), respectively, from the plasma
resonance (plasmons), 0 < z < u − 1, and from the region of close collisions
(single-particle excitations), u − 1 < z < u + 1.

The LW equipartition rule was originally formulated for a single point-like
charged projectile. Here we shall examine and generalize this equipartition rule
for extended projectiles and their diclusters. As an example we shall consider a
dicluster of two He+ ions separated by a variable distance R. In order to deal
with extended projectiles, as a generalization of Eq. (6), we need to consider an
integral proportional to that in Eq. (3),

(7)

which we decompose as ℑp(α, u) + ℑsp(α, u), where ℑp(α, u) and ℑsp(α, u) are
the contributions for plasmon and single-particle excitations.

In Eq.(7) the respective contributions for plasmon and single-particle excita-
tions can be written as the sum of individual (ﬁrst term) and correlated (second
term) stopping terms

ℑp(α, u) = ℑind

Our objective is to show that the LW equipartition rule, ℑp = ℑsp, is not
necessarily satisﬁed for extended projectiles and their clusters. We may therefore
introduce the function

4

∆(α, u) = ℑsp(α, u) − ℑp(α, u),

(9)

which represents the diﬀerence between single-particle and plasmon contributions
to the integral given by Eq. (7). In order to calculate the function ∆(α, u), it is
imperative to consider the integral in the complex z plane and to ﬁnd the poles
of 1/ε(z, u), i.e. the zeros of ε(z, u), for ﬁxed u. It is seen from Eq. (5) that
there must be 4N + 2 zeros of ε(z, u) for ﬁxed u. For a large real value of u,
above the value u0 which corresponds to the minimum in the plasma resonance,
all 4N + 2 zeros lie on the real z axis. Two zeros occur at z = ±zr(u), and are
determined by the intersection with the plasma resonance curve. 2N zeros are
grouped together in the intervals u − 1 < |z| < u + 1, and are responsible for the
single-particle contribution, ℑsp, to the integral in Eq. (7). The remaining 2N
zeros are also grouped together near the point z = 0, but they lie outside of the
interval u − 1 < |z| < u + 1 which is responsible for single-particle excitations.
It can be seen directly from Eq. (5) that at z → 0 ε(z, u) → ∞. Therefore the
contribution of these latter 2N zeros of ε(z, u) to the integral in Eq. (7) vanishes.
It should be noted that in the RPA dielectric function (5), the variable u has
an inﬁnitesimal positive imaginary part which is introduced for causality. It is
seen from Eq. (5) that a small positive imaginary part i0+ being added to u,
is equivalent to a displacement of the zeros of ε(z, u) in the complex z plane in
such a way that the zeros z = ±zr(u) at plasma resonance lie below the real z
axis while the zeros in the region u − 1 < |z| < u + 1, lie above this axis. From
Eq. (5) it also follows that the slope ∂ε(z, u)/∂z is positive at the plasmon curve,
z = zr(u) but negative at the other zero curves, z = zj(u) in the z plane.

With these observations we shall now establish a generalized SP equipartition
sum rule for a He+ ion dicluster projectile, and shall present results for two values
of the orientation angle ϑ made by the projectile velocity vector with the inter-
He+ ion separation vector. The result for a single He+ ion will subsequently be
obtained from the dicluster sum rule.

2.1 He+ ion cluster with ϑ = 0

To derive an expression for a non-zero ∆(α, u) and to generalize the LW summa-
tion rule we consider the following contour integral

Q±(α, u) =

Z 2(z)

1 −

(cid:20)

1
ε(z, u) (cid:21)

ZC1, D1

[1 + exp (±iAz)] zdz,

(10)

where the contours C1 (for Q+(α, u)) and D1 (for Q−(α, u)) are shown in Fig. 1.
These two contours contain the real z axis (0, +∞), upper (for C1) or lower (for
D1) quarter circles, the imaginary z axis (±i∞, 0) and inﬁnitesimal semicircles
C2 or D2. The full structure of the integral in Eq. (10), for the cases of He+ ion
and a dicluster, is more involved than for the case of a point-like ion, and it also

5

contains an exponential function. An analytical evaluation of this integral thus
leads us to consider a contour diﬀerent from the one used in the LW paper (see
[7], for details).

For large values of |z|, the dielectric function must behave as

ε(z, u) → 1 +

χ2
3z4 ,

(11)

according to Eq. (5). Therefore both integrals Q±(α, u) vanish within the upper
and lower quadrants, respectively and from Eq. (10) we ﬁnd

(12)
On the other hand both the integrands in Q±(α, u) are analytical functions in-
side contours C1 and D1 containing single-particle N poles zj +i0+, j = 1, 2, ..., N,
(contour C1) or single plasmon pole, zr(u) − i0+, (contour D1). According to the
theorem of residues, for these functions we have

e.g., [8])

where zj are the zeros of ε(z, u). Since all N single-particle poles lie in the interval
u − 1 < z < u + 1, the integration in Eq. (17) over z results in the summation
form for ℑsp(α, u). However, for plasmon contribution the plasmon pole zr(u)
lies in the interval 0 < z < u − 1, only for suﬃciently high u, u > u0(χ) [7].
The threshold value u0(χ) depends on the electron gas density. For instance, for
metallic densities rs ∼ 2 (χ ∼ 0.5) for threshold value of u we have u0 ∼ 1.4.
When u < u0(χ) the plasmon contribution term vanishes, ℑp = 0.

Next, we note that the imaginary part of the second terms in Eq. (12) has

been omitted, because the function

Note that in Eq. (25) at z = zr(u), where 0 < zr(u) < u − 1, both the real and
imaginary parts of the dielectric function vanish i.e. ε(zr, u) = 0. Therefore one
needs to consider the Cauchy principal value (denoted by P) of the integral.

Eq. (25) is the generalized SPSR for a He+ ion cluster with ϑ = 0. From the
general expression (25) we shall derive below some particular SPSR for individual
He+ ion and diproton cluster with ϑ = 0.

2.1.1

Individual He+ ion

We can derive the SPSR for an individual He+ ion directly from Eq.
(25) if
we consider the limit of A → ∞. In this limit the exponential function in Eq.
(23) eventually vanishes and the function P+(α, u) is deﬁned by the ﬁrst term
in Eq. (23). The second term in Eq. (25) in the limit of A → ∞ must behave
as cos [a (u) A] as can be seen from Eqs.
(17) and (18), where a(u) is some
unspeciﬁed function of u. Therefore the second term in Eq. (25) oscillates with
an increasing A or interionic distance R; the full integral of this term over u is
damped although not necessarily vanishing as A → ∞. However, when we include
a small damping in the electron gas, which is expected for any real medium, the
second term in Eq. (25) vanishes as A → ∞. Thus for an individual He+ ion we
ﬁnd:

∆(h)(α, u) = P∞(α, u),

where P∞(α, u) is the function P+(α, u) at A → ∞.

For individual protons (α → ∞) the right-hand side of Eq. (26) behaves as

(26)

(27)

P∞(α, u) ≃

2πχ2
3α2 (Z − 1) → 0.

8

Consequently, in this limit we recover the known Lindhard-Winther equipartition
rule (ER), ℑsp = ℑp.

2.1.2 Diproton cluster with ϑ = 0

For a diproton cluster (α → ∞) the function P+(α, u) vanishes as in Eq. (27).
Therefore for a cluster of point-like particles we ﬁnd

∞

1 −

(28)

For individual protons (R → ∞ or A → ∞) the RHS of Eq. (28) vanishes
due to a small damping in the electron gas and again we recover the Lindhard-
Winther ER.

2.2 He+ ion cluster with ϑ = π/2
In order to derive an analytical expression for ∆(α, u) for a He+ ion dicluster
with ϑ = π/2, we use the same integration contours C1 and D1 of Fig. 1, and
consider the following integrals

Q±(α, u) =

where H (1)
(z) are the Hankel cylindrical functions of the ﬁrst and
0
second kind, respectively and of zero order. We may recall that the Hankel
functions are analytic inside and on the contours C1 (for Q+(α, u)) and D1 (for
Q−(α, u)) except at the point z = 0 where they have a logarithmic singularity.
Moreover, the functions H (1)
(z) vanish on the upper and lower
0
quadrants, respectively.

(z) and H (2)
0

Using the theorem of residues, the functions Q±(α, u) are evaluated as

Then for ϑ = π/2, we obtain from Eqs.(29)-(31)

ϑ = 0 (see Eq. (28)), for ϑ = π/2 there is no need to introduce an inﬁnitesimal
damping for plasmons and single-particle excitations to get the correct limit at
B → ∞. This is because a fast ion moving in an electron gas excites the wake
ﬁeld which has diﬀerent structures along and across of the direction of motion
[9]. These waves are damped strongly across the direction of motion [9].

2.3 Some simple SPSR

In this subsection we will consider some useful summation rules. To derive the
ﬁrst of them we consider the following contour integral

where the contour C1 is shown in Fig. 1.

Now, in contrast to the previous sections we take the real part of both sides

of Eq. (37). Then using similar calculational techniques as in Sec. 2.1 we ﬁnd

The singularities in the RHS of Eqs. (38) and (39) can be understood in a similar
manner as in Eqs. (34) and (35).

In order to illustrate our analytical results, Eqs.(25)-(28) and (34)-(36), in Fig.
2 we present ∆(α, u) as a function of the parameter u = ω/kvF (u0 6 u 6 λ,
where u0 is the threshold value for plasmon excitation) for an individual He+ ion
(solid line). The lines with and without circles correspond to He+ ion (R = 3 ˚A)
and diproton (R = 1 ˚A) clusters, respectively. ϑ = 0 (dashed lines) and ϑ = π/2
(dotted lines). The numerical results are for fast projectiles λ = V /vF = 8 and for
density parameter rs = 2.07 appropriate to the valence electrons in Al. ∆(α, u)
as a function of u has interesting features. ∆(α, u) remains positive (ℑsp > ℑp)
for He+ ion and for He+ ion cluster with ϑ = 0 (at u > 2) and ϑ = π/2 and
remains negative (ℑsp < ℑp) for diproton cluster with ϑ = 0 and ϑ = π/2. The
curve for He+ ion cluster with ϑ = 0 crosses the zero-axis for u ≃ 2. From Fig.
2 the oscillatory nature of the function ∆(α, u) can be seen for both diproton
and He+ ion clusters with ϑ = 0. Note that for a diproton cluster with ϑ = π/2
at u = λ, when the excited wave moves with the phase velocity ω/k = V , the

11

parameter B vanishes, B = 0. Therefore, from Eqs. (36), (40) and (41) at B → 0
follows ∆ = 0, i.e. the LW equipartition strongly holds. While for He+ ion cluster
with ϑ = π/2 from Eqs. (34), (38) and (39) we ﬁnd that the function ∆ at u = λ
is two times greater than for an individual He+ ion projectile.
In general for
the high velocity domain ω/k ≫ vF (or u ≫ 1) all the curves decrease and an
approximate LW equipartition rule, ℑsp ≃ ℑp holds asymptotically. But it is also
clear that in this high velocity limit the energy losses due to single-particle (ℑsp)
and plasmon (ℑp) excitations decrease as well.

We may conclude with the remark that our analytical expressions are well

supported by numerical results.

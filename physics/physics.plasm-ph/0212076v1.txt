Abstract

Fokker-Planck equation with the velocity-dependent coeﬃcients is consid-
ered for various isotropic systems on the basis of probability transition (PT)
approach. This method provides the self-consistent and universal descrip-
tion of friction and diﬀusion for Brownian particles. Renormalization of the
friction coeﬃcient is shown to occur for two dimensional (2-D) and three di-
mensional (3-D) cases, due to the tensorial character of diﬀusion. The speciﬁc
forms of PT are calculated for the Boltzmann-type of collisions and for the
absorption-type of collisions (the later are typical for dusty plasmas and some
other systems).

Validity of the Einstein’s relation for the Boltzmann-type collisions is
proved for the velocity-dependent friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients. For non-
Boltzmann collisions, such as, e.g., absorption collisions, the Einstein relation
is violated, although some other relations (determined by the structure of PT)
can exist.

The collecting part of the ion drag force in a dusty plasma, arising due to
the ion absorption, is calculated in the framework of the PT approach. This
part is shown to be diﬀerent from the usually considered form. Collecting
”negative drag” is predicted for some plasma parameters.

The concept of probability transition is used to describe motion of active
particles in an ambient medium. On basis of the physical arguments the PT
for a simple model of the active particle is constructed and the coeﬃcients
of the relevant Fokker-Planck equation are found. The stationary solution of
this equation is typical for the simplest self-organized molecular machines.

Brownian dynamics nowadays is in the focus of interest due to the wide new ﬁelds
of applications: physical-chemical systems, so-called active walkers, e.g., cells and other
objects in biological systems, dusty plasmas with natural and artiﬁcial grains and many

other systems. The characteristic property of such systems is the velocity dependent friction
and diﬀusion coeﬃcients. Existence of the Einstein relation and even the correct speciﬁc
forms of the Fokker-Planck equation for such systems are not still completely clariﬁed. In
particular, the attempts to use the Langevin equation as a stochastic basis for derivation
of the Fokker-Planck equation lead to non-sign-valued result. The diﬀerent forms of the
Fokker-Planck equation, such as so-called Ito and Stratonovich [1-4] ones, appear. For the
systems close to equilibrium Brownian particles keep stationary random motion under the
action of stochastic forces, which are compensated by the particle friction and thus, the
work produced by the Langevin sources is equal to the energy dissipated in course of the
Brownian particle motion. This energy balance is described by the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem in the form of the Einstein law. Obviously, the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem
and the Einstein relation can be violated in the case of non-equilibrium systems (even in
the stationary case), in particular in the open systems. Starting from the classical Lord
Rayleigh work [5] many studies of the non-equilibrium motion of Brownian particles with
an additional (inner, or external) energy supply have been performed. In particular, such
studies are of great importance for physical-chemical [6,7] and biological [8] systems, in
which non-equilibrium Brownian particle motion is referred as the motion of active Brownian
particles. The dynamical and energetic aspects of motion for the active Brownian particles
have been described recently on the basis of the Langevin equation and the appropriate
Fokker-Planck equation [9,10]. Possibility of negative friction (negative values of the friction
coeﬃcient) for Brownian particles was regarded, as a result of energy pumping. For some
phenomenological dependence of the friction coeﬃcient as a function of the grain’s velocity
the one-particle stationary non-Maxwellian distribution function was found.

The traditional formulations of the non-equilibrium Brownian motion are based on some
In particular, it
phenomenological expressions for the friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients.
means that deviations from the Einstein relation, as well as the velocity dependence of
these coeﬃcients are postulated and high level of uncertainty for the application of such
models to the real systems takes place. Recently we considered another situation, when
the kinetic coeﬃcients can be calculated explicitly on the basis of microscopically derived
Fokker-Planck equation for dusty plasmas [11,12]. It was recently shown [13] that in the
case of strong Coulomb interaction of highly charged grains in dusty plasmas, due to ion
absorption by grains, the friction coeﬃcient can become negative. The necessary criterion
1 (here Zg, Zi
for negative friction due to ion absorption is found as Γ
are the charge numbers for the grains and ions respectively, a is the grain radius, Ti is the
ion temperature). The appropriate threshold value of the grain charge was determined.
The stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with the velocity-dependable kinetic
coeﬃcients was obtained and the considerable deviation of such solution from the Maxwellian
distribution was demonstrated. The physical reason for manifestation of negative friction in
that case is clear: the cross-section for ion absorption by grain increases, when the relative
velocity between the ion and grain decreases, due to the charge-dependent part of the cross-
section. Therefore, for a moving highly-charged grain (Γ
1) the momentum transfer
from ions to the grain in the direction of grain velocity can be higher than in the opposite
direction.

In this paper we develop more general approach, based on probability transition, to
simplify the Fokker-Planck equation and to calculate the velocity dependent friction and

diﬀusion coeﬃcients for the diﬀerent systems. On that way we ﬁnd the various forms of
probability transition for the Boltzmann-type and for absorption collision integrals. The
crucial peculiarity of the exact expressions for the mentioned coeﬃcients follows from the
exact representation of these coeﬃcients through the function of probability transition:
-it is impossible to deﬁne the coeﬃcients independently not only for the processes, which
lead to the thermodynamic equilibrium, when the Einstein relation is valid, but also for the
systems in which there is stationary, but non-equilibrium state, or for the systems far from
equilibrium;
-any rigorous approximate model of the Fokker-Planck equation have to be based on self-
consistent expressions for the friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients, based on the PT.

As an example we consider a wide class of open or far from equilibrium systems, where
the Einstein relation is not applicable. For active particles the suggested consideration
can be easily applied by construction of the probability transition on basis of the physical
arguments.

II. PROBABILITY TRANSITION AND VELOCITY-DEPENDABLE FRICTION
AND DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS

The appropriate kinetic equation describing motion of Brownian particles in some

medium with the momentum exchange may be written as

dfg(P, t)
dt

= Ig(P, t) =

dq

w(P + q, q)fg(P + q, t)
{

Z

w(P, q)fg(P, t)

,

}

−

where fg(P) is the distribution function of Brownian particles (grains) of the mass M. The
elementary process is change of momentum of the grain P to (P
q). The probability
transition w(P, q) in Eq. (1) describes the probability for grain with linear momentum P
to lose the momentum q. The Eq. (1) has a form of master equation.
In general the
probability transition is the function of time itself. To simplify Eq. (1) for the processes
with the momentum transfer q
P we have expand the right side of Eq. (1) by q. The
≪
result of the expansion is the Fokker-Planck equation for grains:

−

The coeﬃcients Ai(P) and Bij(P), as easy to see by expansion of the Eq. (1), are
expressed explicitly through the probability transition w(P, q) by the relations (e.g. [3,14]):

(1)

(2)

(4)

Let us suggest that probability transition w(P, q) is a function of only two vectors P
and q. It means, for example, there is no, let say, drift velocity of the media, surrounded the

grain, as well as some inner vector inside the grain, which can inﬂuence on the probability
transition. For that case the general structure of the coeﬃcients Ai and Bij is evident:

−

(δij −

Ai(P) = Piβ(P ), Bij(P) =

PiPj
P 2 ) B⊥(P ),

PiPj
P 2 Bk(P )
where β(P ), Bk(P ) and B⊥(P ) are the functions of modulus P . Let us consider at ﬁrst the
stationary case to understand the form of the Fokker-Planck equation and solution, when
the friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients are the functions of grain’s velocity. On this basis,
in particular, the well known problem related to the Ito [1] and Stratonovich [2] forms of
Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations[3,4] can be solved and applicability of the Einstein
relation for the various kinds of functions of probability transitions can be established. The
results can be used also for unstationary case, if the coeﬃcients save their form in that case
(what is not always valid, naturally). Than, taking into account isotropy of the distribution
function fg(P), the Fokker-Planck equation is given by

grains V instead momentum P and the diﬀusion tensor Dij(V) = M 2Bij(V). We also use
these notations below. The functions β∗(V ) and Dk(V ) are determined via the transition

We see that, in general, for the isotropic case the three scalar functions of P , determined
by the diﬀerent moments of probability transition, permit to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients in the
Fokker-Planck equation. The stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with the
kinetic coeﬃcients from Eq. (8, 10) for the grain distribution function fg(V ) is

where C is a constant, providing normalization. As easy to see from the Eq. (6) for isotropic
case the stationary (as well as non-stationary) Fokker-Planck equation with the velocity-
dependent coeﬃcients has well deﬁned form and the question of ”renormalized” friction
coeﬃcient is solved completely by the Eq. (8). The uncertainty in choice of the Fokker-
Planck equation in the forms suggested, e.g., in [1,2] and [4], created by attempts to connect
the Langevin and the respective Fokker-Planck equations by one-to-one correspondence,
starting from the Langevin equation. The real structure of this renormalization, due to
tensorial character of the diﬀusion Dij(V) as follows from the Eq. (8), permits to reformulate
the problem: what must be the structure of Langevin equation for s-dimensional case to
be relevant to the single-valued Fokker-Planck equation, based on the speciﬁc probability
transition. Because we use, as the basis, transition probability we can establish validity
or violation of the Einstein relation between the friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients directly,
without usual suggestion of Maxwellian form of the static distribution function, which is valid
for the equilibrium state (when the Einstein relation is fulﬁlled). In particular, existence
of the Einstein (or some diﬀerent) relation between the momentum-dependable coeﬃcients
can be investigated. Correspondence between the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations
for s-dimensional case on the basis of PT approach will be considered in details in a separate
publication. Below we ﬁnd the probability transition and investigate the various cases for
PT and Fokker-Planck equations.

III. THE BOLTZMANN-TYPE COLLISIONS

Let us consider the Boltzmann collision integral for two species of particles-light com-
ponent (called below atoms) with the mass m
M and grains, which interact one with
another (generalizations can be easily done). To ﬁnd the function w(P, q) it is enough,
for example, to trasform the part of the Boltzmann collision integral, describing the lose
of grains in the phase volume d P near the point P, to the variables P and q, where q is
the momentum, trasferred during the elementary act of collision between atom and grain.
Than, compairing the result of transformation with the Eq. (1), for 3D case we ﬁnd

be established for the considered Boltzmann-type collisions. Than with accuracy to small

IV. ABSORPTION COLLISIONS

Now turn to the other type of collisions, namely to absorption collisions, which are typi-
cal, for example, for dusty plasmas and some other open systems. As well known the process
of grain charging by absorption of the electrons and ions by grains leads to the stationary
(but non-equilibrium) state in plasma discharges. In so called OML (orbital motion limited)
approximation the electrons and ions approaching to the grain on the distance less than
the grain radius a are assumed to be absorbed.
It is clear that the absorption collisions
cannot be described by Boltzmann-type collision integral. The appropriate correct form of
the absorption collision integral have been postulated and applied in [14,15]. The rigorous
kinetic theory of the electron and ion absorption in dusty plasmas, which exist in parallel
with the usual processes of electron and ion scattering by grains, have been developed in
[11,12], where also the Fokker-Planck equation for the charged grains was justiﬁed. Below
we use the simplest form of Fokker-Planck equation for grains with a ﬁxed charge (distri-
bution by charge assumed narrow, what is often in reality). Our aim here is to ﬁnd the
probability function for the absorption and to demonstrate the eﬃcacy of such approach.
More complicated cases can be considered similarly. We also ignore the increase of the grain
mass [16, 17], assuming that neutral atoms generated in the course of the surface electron-
ion recombination escape from the grain surface into a plasma. Naturally this process also
changes the momentum balance for the particles, but we will not consider this process in
our present model. Than the kinetic equation for grains can be written as:

where fs(p) is the distribution functions for the electrons (s = e) and ions (s = i) and

Below on basis of the Eqs. (23)-(25) the two diﬀerent, but connected problems are solved.
At ﬁrst, to consider the problem of absorption in simplest form, we accept the next simpliﬁ-
cation in spirit of [16,17], namely we will consider absorption of neutral atoms of a one sort.
It means we put Q = 0 and instead summation by s save only notation with the index n
(for the neutral atoms) in the Eqs. (23)-(25). Generalization of this simplest model to the
case of charge absorption with a ﬁxed charge is quite simple.

The second problem in focus of our interest is connected with a real dusty plasma,
when there is ion stream and so called drag force applied to the grains and created by ion
absorption and ion scattering.

7

Let us start with a system of neutral particles, absorbing by grains. The momentum
transferred to the grain due to absorption, is equal to the momentum of the atom p colliding
with the grain. Therefore the probability transition w(P, q) for the considered case can be
immediately found by comparison of the Eqs. (1), (23)

(cid:12)
case, that absorption is purely geometrical σabs = πa2 (the particular case of the Eq. (25) for
Q = 0), we easily obtain with accuracy
β(V ). A simple calculation
leads to the relation between β(V ) and Dk(V ):

This relation is diﬀerent from the Einstein one and coincides with the result obtained in
[12,17], as the limiting case (Q = 0) of the Fokker-Planck equation for dusty plasma in the
case of the dominant absorption collisions with the coeﬃcients β∗(V )
β(0) and

This consideration shows that the structure of the Fokker-Planck equation for the pro-
cesses, based on the Boltzmann-type collision integrals, is very diﬀerent from the processes of
other type, when Boltzmann-type collisions are not relevant. For the ﬁrst type of processes
the Einstein relation is valid, even for the case of velocity dependent the friction and dif-
fusion coeﬃcients. For the non-Boltzmann type of momentum transferring the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem is not exist, through some relation between the friction and diﬀusion
coeﬃcients can take place (speciﬁc for the each type of PT). These results have deep conse-
quences for many physical systems, as well as for the systems of biological nature, e.g. cells
motion in solutions and other, so called active walkers.

V. COLLECTING DRAG FORCE

In this section as an application of the developed theory we consider the problem of
momentum transfer from the ion stream to grains in dusty plasmas. Due to ion absorption
and scattering by grains the drag force, acting on grains, appears. This force plays a crucial
role in many experimental observations and, probably, is important for the voids formation
in dusty plasmas for both ”earthly” [18-20] and microgravity [21] conditions; the theory
essentially based on the drag force was given in [22,23]. The ion drag force FI consists of

8

In the paper of Barnes et al.[24] the
two parts, so called collection and scattering ones.
analytical expression for the drag collection and scattering force was done. Later on the
theory of drag force was actively developed analytically and numerically [23-28] to improve
It was achieved for the scattering part FIs , but as we show below the
the description.
collecting part FIc, starting from [24], was considered incorrect. Here we are focusing mainly
on the part FIc. Let us calculate the general expression for the friction force Ff on basis
of the Fokker-Planck equation for the charged grains ((Eqs. (3),(23)). We calculate here Ff
only for ions, because we are interested the ion part of friction. Generalization for many
species of the light components (electrons, atoms) is trivial. By integration of Eq. (2) on
momentum we ﬁnd for the time evolution of the average momentum Pg:

d P ˜Ai(P, y) fg(P, t),

The function ˜Ai(P, y) is a generalization of Ai(P) of the Eq. (5) for the case of existence
of some additional vector in the probability transition. In the case under consideration this
vector y is the momentum, determined by the velocity of the ion stream y = Mu:

˜Ai(P, y) =

dq qi w(P, y, q),

For the case of ion ﬂow it is quite natural to use shifted Maxwellian distribution function

This picture can be easily generalized for a few species of the light particles. These results
have an interesting consequence for dusty plasmas. Let us apply these results for the case

Here we use the limits for the angles of integration, taking into account to provide conver-
gence for the Coulomb cross-section in the case of the ion-grain scattering. Eq. (37) coincides
with the well known general formulae for the transferring of momentum from light to heavy
particle, which can be justiﬁed from the simple physical arguments, as it was done in e.g. in
[29].

The formula of the similar structure, but with the collecting cross-section, instead trans-
port scattering cross-section, was applied also for the collecting force in [21,23,27] and other
papers. As follows from our consideration it is not correct, due to non-Boltzmann struc-
ture of the absorption integral. As consequence, we have other structure for the transition
probability w(P, q) determined by Eq. (26) instead Eq. (14). The speciﬁc form of β which
determines the collecting form can be calculated on basis of the Eqs. (24)-(26). We will not
discuss here in details the diﬀerence between these two results. It is enough to mention,
that the collecting force calculated on basis of the formula similar to the Eq. (24) with the
collecting cross-section is always positive. It means ion wind accelerates grains. Another
situation exists for the absorption part of ion drag on basis of consequent calculation of
the friction coeﬃcient β(V ). Recently in [13] the coeﬃcient β(V ) was calculated explicitely
and it was found, that it can change sign (”negative friction”) from positive to negative
e2ZgZi/aTi > 1. Already this fact shows the principal diﬀerence of
for the parameter Γ
the approaches and importance of rigorous consideration. It does not mean that negative
friction can be easily found in experiment, as motion of grain with non-Maxwellian distri-
bution function with a maximum around some non-zero velocity, because other scattering
mechanisms (with positive friction) can be more important. This problem was discussed in
[13] separately. According to Eq. (36) and calculations in [13] the collecting part of ion drag
force (per one grain, y = Mu) can be written as:

We will not present here the results of the concrete analytical calculation for β(y) and
the collecting part of the drag force. As it was stressed, the analysis of negative friction
was done in details in [13] on basis of analytical calculations of the integral in Eq. (40).
Because, as we showed analytically, the collecting part of the ion drag force is the same as
the friction of moving particle, due to ion collection, but has the opposite sign (really for
the case of the mono-energetic particles it is the consequence of relativity of motion) we can
use the same expression, as in [13]. The opportunity to observe the ”negative drag” (we use
this term to determine the eﬀect of motion for a grain in the direction opposite to the ion
stream direction) in dusty plasma is more easy, than to observe the ”negative friction”. For

10

”negative friction” the process of normal atom’s scattering, additional to the light charges
scattering, can easily suppresses the eﬀect. In the case of ”negative drag”, when a grain is
immobile, the suppressing mechanisms are less: only the electron and ion scattering.

VI. ACTIVE PARTICLES

During the last decade investigation of motion of the self-organized objects, as, e.g.,
cells, is in a focus of interest, due to numerous measurements and observations of their
dynamical behavior [8,30]. Our goal in this work to show, that construction of the relevant
probability transition on basis of the simple physical requirements permits to justify the
relevant description of such systems. In particular, we show, that for the simplest structure
of PT for motion of an active particle, the known (and experimentally veriﬁed) structure of
the velocity distribution of grains (cells)[30], which are able to the directed motion near a
ﬁxed non-zero velocity, can be justiﬁed. The coeﬃcients of this distribution are calculated.
Let us formulate some general conditions to ﬁnd the structure of the PT for active
particles. We suppose that the linear momentum, transferring from a grain to surrounding
medium, is created due to loss of the inner energy of this grain. Below we ignore the processes
of energy supply, which can be included separately in more complicated schemes.

q

≪

At ﬁrst we assume that the transferred to medium momentum q

P is distributed
near some ﬁxed value q0. The frequency of generation of the transferring momentum q will
be denoted as µ(q). It can be approximated, for example, by the product of the functions,
= q and on the space angles θ, ϕ between the vec-
describing distributions on modulus
tors q and P, if there are no others, besides P, characteristic vectors for the system. In
this simplest case we can put µ(q) = ν0 µ1(q)µ2(θ, ϕ), where ν0 is the q-independent fre-
quency of momentum generation by a grain (cell). Below we suggest that the ϕ-dependence
of µ2 is absent. The distribution µ1(q) can be gaussian or, for the limit case of very nar-
row distribution of the transferring momentum, can be approximated by the delta-function
q0). For the function µ2(θ) we suppose, that the angle θ between the direction
µ1(q) = δ(q
of the transferred momentum and the momentum of the active grain is enclosed between
the values π
θ0 < θ < π, where θ0 is some acute angle. Due to this ampliﬁcation of the
grains takes place. Consideration for the 2D and 1D cases is evident.

The ”weight function” ∆(θ) for the angle θ can be included to describe the axis-
symmetrical non-homogeneity of ampliﬁcation for the diﬀerent angles θ. We can also include
two additional weight ”functions”: Σ(P ) and Υ(ε
ε0). The ﬁrst one describes dependence
PT from the modulus P of the momentum P, the second one provides that momentum trans-
ferring is possible only if the inner energy of a grain ε is bigger than some ﬁxed minimal
value of inner energy ε0, let say Υ(ε

ε0), where ϑ is the step-like function.

Under these assumptions the PT for the momentum transferring wε, due to loss of inner

To ﬁnd the total expressions for β(P ) and D(p) we have add to the values (42),(43) of βε(P )
and Dε(P ) the parts of the friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients aroused due to collisions between
the grain, moving with momentum P, and the surrounding particles (atoms). For the case
of 3D elastic collisions and the hard sphere interaction these parts were calculated on basis
of the Eqs.
(15)-(18). For the velocities of grains essentially less, than the characteristic
velocity of atoms we can ignore the velocity-dependent multipliers and consider the parts of
the coeﬃcients βel(V ) = β0 and Del(V ) = D0, connected with the elastic collisions, as the
constants. These constants, as well as the initial velocity-dependent functions (see Eq.(21))
are connected by the Einstein relation Del(V ) = MT βel(V )

MT β0.

If we make the probable assumption, that Σ(P ) is a constant, what means that the PT
wε is not dependable from the grain velocity (as the process, which is determined by the
inner state of the grains), we ﬁnd from the Eq. (42), that βε(P )
1/P . Due to this speciﬁc
dependence the Fokker-Planck equation for the grains can be written as

where Kε > 0 is a constant, determined by the equality βε ≡ −

(18). Finally, the result is β0 = mnaS/(12M√2πmT ), where S = πa2 is the area of the grain
and na is the density of the atoms. The stationary solution of the Eq.(44) is the Gaussian
distribution:

The velocity dependence of the distribution function fg(V ) (45) coincides with one found
in [30] on basis of the phenomenological assumption, concerning the structure of the friction
coeﬃcient in Langevin equation. This type of the velocity distribution function in our
consideration is the consequence of physically clear choice of the perturbation transition.
It can be generalized for more complicated and practically important cases, when there
are one or more (additional to P) vectors, which determine the direction of q. It can be
some inner vector- ”driver”, which can be orientated on the external gradients of density,
or temperature, or concentration of some ingredient in the system. In that case naturally
the equilibrium state is not eﬀectively one-dimensional. Active particle (e.g., cell) can turn
during motion. These problems will be considered separately.

Here we use the simple and eﬀective way for concretization of the Fokker-Planck equa-
tion on basis of self-consistent determination of the friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients. Both

are determined as the functionals of probability transition. This function possesses a very
diﬀerent structure for the Boltzmann-type collisions and the other ones. We found PT for
the Boltzmann-type collisions and proved that velocity dependent friction and diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcients are connected by the Einstein relation. The velocity dependence of these coeﬃcients
and renormalization of the friction coeﬃcient in 2D and 3D cases, as a consequence of the
tensorial structure of diﬀusion is found. Because the Fokker-Planck equation is single-valued
also for the velocity-dependent coeﬃcients the problem of connection between Langevin and
Fokker-Planck equation has to be reformulated as a problem of the relevant (to the Fokker-
Planck equation) Langevin equation.

For the non-Boltzmann collisions, e.g. for the absorption collisions, the structure of PT
follows from the structure of the collision integral, obtained earlier [11,14,15] and leads,
in particular, to the diﬀerent from the Einstein’s relations between the coeﬃcients in the
respective Fokker-Planck equation.

As the example of application of the PT method to the various systems we considered
the drag force in dusty plasma, due to the ion ”wind”. The collecting part of this force is
determined by a friction coeﬃcient, as function of ion stream velocity. The remarkable fact
is that the sign of this coeﬃcient can be negative for some plasma parameters, as it was
recently shown[13]. In application to ion drag, due to the straight connection between the
collecting ion drag force and the friction coeﬃcient, proved above, it means that this force
can move the grain in the direction opposite to the velocity of the ion stream.

We also constructed the PT for the active particles (e.g., grains or cells) in an ambient
medium for some simple situation. On basis of physically clear assumptions we found that
the part of the PT, responsible for self-motion can possess the peculiarity 1
P , where P is
the momentum of a grain. In presence also of the usual friction mechanism the stationary
solution of the relevant Fokker-Planck equation is gaussian with a pick around some non-
zero velocity. Some generalizations of the obtained results for more complicated cases are
suggested.

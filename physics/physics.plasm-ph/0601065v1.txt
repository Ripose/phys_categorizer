Abstract

The properties of amplitude modulated broadband Alfv´en waves is investigated. In particular,

the dynamics of circularly polarized dispersive Alfv´en waves, governed by a derivative nonlinear

Schr¨odinger equation, is analyzed using the Wigner formalism. The modulational instability of

random phase dispersive pump Alfv´en waves is investigated, and it is shown that the spectral

broadening gives rise to a new mode structure.

INTRODUCTION

About thirty years ago, Rogister [1] introduced an elegant perturbation technique of

the Vlasov–Maxwell system of equations in order to investigate amplitude modulation of

magnetic ﬁeld-aligned circularly polarized dispersive Alfv´en waves in an electron–ion plasma.

He derived a derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger (DNLS) equation, which is exactly integrable

by the inverse scattering transform method [2]. The DNLS equation for nonlinear dispersive

Alfv´en waves have also been derived by means of the two-ﬂuid – Maxwell system of equations

[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and the modulational instability of a constant a amplitude Alfv´en pump

wave has been investigated . Also reported is the algebraic envelope Alfv´en soliton [3, 9].

The DNLS equation has been extended to include the eﬀects of collisions and wave-

particle interactions [10, 11]. The resulting modiﬁed DNLS equation has been used to

investigate damping of the envelope Alfv´enic soliton.

In this paper, we report on the nonlinear stability of broadband dispersive Alfv´en waves in

plasmas. We introduce a Wigner–Moyal formalism [12, 13] for the modiﬁed DNLS equation

and derive a kinetic equation for Alfv´enic quasiparticles. While the DNLS equation is

appropriate for studies of modulational instability of a coherent Alfv´en pump wave, the

kinetic equation can be adopted to investigate the eﬀects of partial coherence and random

phases associated with broadband dispersive Alfv´en wave packets.

II. GOVERNING EQUATIONS

Let us consider the nonlinear propagation of circularly polarized dispersive Alfv´en waves

along the external magnetic ﬁeld B0ˆz, where B0 is the magnetic ﬁeld strength and ˆz is the

unit vector along the z-axis. The dynamics of modulated Alfv´en wave envelopes is governed

by the modiﬁed DNLS equation [10, 11]

where the subscripts t and z denotes the corresponding derivatives. Equation (1) governs

the amplitude modulation of circularly polarized Alfv´en waves. Here u = (Bx + iBy)/(2|1 −

With (2) and (3), Eq. (1) is a special case of the equation

i∂tu + g ∂2

z u + F (|u|2; t, z)u + i∂z[G(|u|2; t, z)u] = 0,

where g is a complex valued constant and F and G are complex valued functions. This

equation can be found in a wide variety of applications, such as Bose-Einstein condensation

and nonlinear optics, apart from in plasma physics. Next we proceed to analyze Eq. (5) for

broad band waves.

Wigner function is given by the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation function, and

as a generalized distribution function for quasi-particles it can be used to describe a broad

band spectrum of the ﬁeld represented by u, e.g. Alfv´en waves. We note that from (6) the

III. ANALYSIS OF THE COHERENT CASE

We note that Eq. (1) has solutions of the modiﬁed plane wave form u(t, z) =

¯u(t) exp[ik0z − iω0(t)t].

In the collisional case (2) the time-dependent frequency is given

by

while the amplitude is exponentially damped according to

¯u(t) = u0 exp(−Dk2

0t).

Here u0 is the constant amplitude of the solution, and we note that as D → 0 we obtain the
time-independent dispersion relation ω0 = k2

0. In the collisionless case (3) however,

the character of the function p[u, u∗] together with the above plane wave ansatz makes the

amplitude time-independent, and subsequently the frequency becomes

ω0 = k2

0 + sk0u2
0,

(14)

where ¯u = u0 denotes the constant amplitude. Thus, with the plane wave ansatz, the eﬀects

due to the thermal correction (3) vanish.

Coherent modulational

instabilities can be analyzed by letting u = (¯u(t) +

u1(t, z)) exp[ik0z − iω0(t)t] + c.c., where |u1| ≪ ¯u, the time variation of ¯u is assumed slow

compared to the time scale of the perturbation, and c.c. denotes the complex conjugate.

Linearizing Eq. (1) with respect to u1, dividing u1 into its real and imaginary part, and as-

suming the wavenumber and frequency K and Ω of the perturbation we ﬁnd the dispersion

the case. Letting γ = Im(Ω) where γ is the growth rate, we ﬁnd from (15a)

γ = −DK 2 +

IV. EFFECTS OF PARTIAL COHERENCE

Returning to Eq. (11), we ﬁrst look for solutions of the form ρ = ¯ρ(t, k). In the collisional

case (12a) Eq. (11) takes the form ∂t ¯ρ + 2Dk2 ¯ρ = 0. This is integrated to yield

¯ρ = ρ0(k) exp(−2Dk2t).

(18)

Equation (18) is in agreement with the monochromatic result (13b) based on Eq. (1), if

we let ρ0(k) = I0δ(k − k0).
where ¯I(t) =

agreement with the monochromatic result.

R

In the collisionless case (3), the ansatz for ρ gives H = 0,

dk ¯ρ(t, k). Thus, the expression (12b) gives ¯ρ = ρ0(k) through Eq. (11), in

Next we look at perturbation around the background solutions. Thus, we let ρ = ¯ρ(t, k)+

ρ1(k) exp(iKz − iΩt) + c.c., where |ρ1| ≪ ρ0 and |∂t ¯ρ| ≪ Ω¯ρ, and linearize with respect
to ρ1. With I = ¯I(t) + I1 exp(iKz − iΩt) + c.c. it follows that H ≈ ¯H + H1 = H1 =

the collisional case (2), and L(k) = 0 and a = C/4 in the collisionless case (3).

In the

monochromatic case, we have ρ0(k) = I0δ(k −k0). The dispersion relation (20) then becomes

dispersion relations (15) when neglecting the slow background time variations.

However, if the Alfv´en waves suﬀer random perturbations in e.g. the phase, the correlation

between the waves may be nontrivial [14]. The partial coherence introduced by a random

phase may be modeled by the Lorentzian distribution [15]

where ∆ denotes the width of the distribution around k0. Due to the ﬁnite width of the

Lorentz distribution the dispersion integral (20) will have poles. In the collisional case (2)

we obtain a rather lengthy analytical expression, where a complicated interplay between the

spectral broadening, represented by ∆, and the collision parameter D takes place. Thus, we

do not explicitly state this particular result here, but instead give the numerical solution of

(20) in conjunction with the Lorentzian distribution (22) in the collisional case (2) (see Fig.

1). However, in the collisionless case (3), the result is somewhat more compact and takes

(cid:27)

(23)

where ¯Ω = Ω − 2k0K − sKI0.

Letting ¯Ω = Re( ¯Ω) + iΓ, where Re denotes the real part, we can solve the nonlinear

dispersion relations numerically for the growth rate Γ as a function of the wavenumber K.

The results are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, where we have used I0 = 0.5 and k0 = 1. We see that

the parameter region with s = 1 exhibits new properties as compared to the coherent case.

A new type of instability occurs due to the spectral broadening of the dispersive Alfv´en

pump wave.

V. SUMMARY

We have investigated the nonlinear stability of broadband dispersive Alfv´en waves in

magnetoplasmas, using a Wigner–Moyal formalism. A new mode structure with new insta-

bilities, due to the ﬁnite spectral width of the dispersive Alfv´en pump wave, is found. The

spectral broadening in conjunction with the kinetic modiﬁcation of the DNLS equation can

thus give rise to growing modes not present in the coherent case.

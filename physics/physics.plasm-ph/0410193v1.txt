Abstract

Diﬀusion of particles in velocity space undergoing turbulent ﬁeld was extensively stud-
ied in the problem of warm beam relaxation. Under low ﬁeld intensities the diﬀusion is
described by the Fokker-Planck equation with the diﬀusion coeﬃcient given by quasilin-
ear theory. This diﬀusion coeﬃcient is calculated on the free particle propagator and for
weak ﬁelds its renormalization due to orbit diﬀusion is not necessary. To study eﬀects
which should be taken into account when the intensity of the turbulent ﬁeld is increased a
numerical simulation of particle motion in the external ﬁeld of Langmuir waves with given
k-spectrum and random phases is done. For strong ﬁelds meansquare velocity evolution
shows that ballistic regime in the very beginning is changed for oscillatory one in the
intermediate stage and later for diﬀusion. Asymptotically it behaves like fractional power
of elapsed time with the exponent dependent on the particular ﬁeld spectrum. Such evolu-
tion in the whole temporal interval of simulation is recovered from the numerical solution
of generalized Fokker-Planck equation with time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient obtained
from the microscopic approach. The analytical approximation for this solution is also
given.

1 Introduction

Diﬀusion of particles in random external ﬁelds could be considered in relation to a general prob-
lem of transport in plasmas. The test particle approach, which is simpler and more controllable
than selfconsistent one, helps to analyze some particular aspects of turbulent transport.

One of not clariﬁed issues reported in papers [1,2] concerns the enhancement of a diﬀusion
coeﬃcient in velocity space as compared to its quasilinear value. It was supposed [1] that the
enhancement was caused by peaks in spectrum being formed in a course of evolution. The
tendency of formation of nonuniform structures in plasma-beam system was pointed out in
the works [3]. Here we are interested in what eﬀects are to be taken into account when the
spectrum of external ﬁeld become stronger and narrower, i.e. more peaked.

We have made a direct simulation of test particle motion in prescribed random ﬁelds for
a variety of spectra, and found from obtained data the evolution of average velocity and dis-
persion. Then the generalization of the Fokker-Planck equation were considered in order the
solutions would be consistent with simulation in wide range of variation of external ﬁeld spectra.
As it was expected for low intensity and broad spectrum (small Kubo number) solutions of
Fokker-Planck equation with quasilinear diﬀusion coeﬃcient agree with the results of simula-
tion. When the form of spectrum is taken peaked (Kubo number becomes larger than the unit)
the velocity dispersion grows very fast at a time less than the ﬁeld correlation time, and such
jump of dispersion on the very early (prekinetic) stage could give a substantial contribution to
overall dispersion. In this case the distribution function is governed by a Fokker-Planck equa-
tion with time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation with
quasilinear and time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcients were found numerically, and an analytical
approximation for them was proposed as well.

The numerical experiment gives the power law behavior of the dispersion at simulation
times, and solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation shows it for extended interval. However the

1

exponent is not unique for all spectra of the same type, as this follows from scaling consideration
[4], but depends on the particular spectrum.

We consider the motion of noninteracting particles in an external random electric ﬁeld. The
potential of the ﬁeld is taken as a superposition of M waves [5]

3 Equation for distribution function and approximate

analytical solution

Introduce here the particle distribution function f (v, t) as microscopic distribution function
averaged over random phase ensemble and integrated over the spatial variable x. As far as the
averaging over the ensemble of random phase does not imply the averaging over any small but
ﬁnite time scale, the distribution function is deﬁned at all time scales, as well for t < τcor, i.e.
in prekinetic stage. Generalized Fokker-Planck equation for f (v, t) in external ﬁelds could be
obtained from Ref. 6 in the form

It will be shown that for moderate Kubo number the agreement with simulation is recovered
by more accurate treatment of distribution function evolution on early stage t < τcor. Here the

4 Comparison of simulation with numerical and analyt-

ical solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation

In this section results of simulations are compared with numerical and analytical solutions of
the Fokker-Planck equation. For small Kubo numbers the solutions of Fokker-Planck equation
with asymptotic quasilinear diﬀusion coeﬃcient give the similar evolution of velocity dispersion
and average velocity as the solutions with time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient. In addition, for
very small Kubo numbers at the beginning of evolution the velocity dispersion grows almost
linearly. Whether Kubo number increase the deviation from the linear law due to dependence of
diﬀusion coeﬃcient on velocity becomes evident, however the solutions with Dql(v) and D(v, t)
are still rather close. For a moderate Kubo numbers of the order of the unit, the diﬀerence
between solutions with time dependent and asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient becomes noticeable.
In Fig. 2 the curves obtained in simulation for a wide spectrum and moderate ﬁeld are com-
pared with the numerical solution of Fokker-Planck equation and the WKB solution (17), (18).

The above examples were given for particles which initial velocity are not so far from the
phase velocity of the central harmonic. Such particles in each instant are in resonance with
some harmonic of considerable intensity and diﬀusion prevail over oscillations. For particles
which initial velocities are far from resonance with intensive harmonics the diﬀusivity is small
and oscillations become more distinct. In Fig. 4 dispersion are given for nonresonant particle.
The curves obtained in simulation, as numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with

Simulation shows the velocity dispersion obeys a power law dependence on time. Numerical
solutions of Fokker-Planck equation give the same power law, as simulation, and it easily could
be calculated for much longer time. Such power law is also recovered from WKB approximation,
and in this case it could be related to power law dependence of normalizing constants C(t).

The velocity dispersion shows power law time dependence, with exponent dependent on partic-
ular spectrum. In terms of WKB solution it is related to power law dependence of normalizing
constant C(t).

Conclusions

For small ﬁeld intensity and wide spectrum (Kubo number less than the unit) the solution of the
Fokker-Planck equation with quasilinear diﬀusion coeﬃcient gives good agreement with results
of numerical experiment. To have a consistency for high intensity and/or narrow spectrum
(Kubo number of the order or larger than the unit) the generalization of the Fokker-Planck
equation is to be done by introducing a time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient. An analytical
approximation for such solutions is proposed. Velocity dispersion manifests power law time
dependence and the exponent is dependent on the spectrum.

Nonlinear oscillations within a plasma slab are analyzed. Two types of solutions are

found, depending on the initial value of the electron density. The ﬁrst represents regular

oscillations within the plasma slab, while the second gives rise to explosive growth at the

slab centre or at the edges. The results are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

A few plasma physics problems can be solved exactly (e.g. Akhiezer and Lyubarskii, 1951;

Dawson, 1959; Davidson, 1972; Shivamoggi, 1988; Stenﬂo and Yu, 1997). The plasma distur-

bances have in those cases been allowed to be so large that no expansion techniques are applicable.

The new exact solutions can be useful in interpreting observed large amplitude wave phenomena

in detail, as well as for verifying new approximation schemes and numerical methods in the study

of nonlinear effects. We shall in the present paper reconsider one of the simplest possible situa-
tions, namely that of one-dimensional (¶ y = ¶ z = 0) oscillations in a cold plasma slab (−d ≤ x ≤ d)
where the electrons are mobile, whereas the ions are immobile and form a ﬁxed background with

the constant density n0. The special case where the electron density n is only a function of time

and where the cold electron ﬂuid velocity v(x,t) satisﬁes the boundary conditions v(±d,t) = 0

has been solved previously (Aliev and Stenﬂo, 1994; Stenﬂo, 1996). Here we shall use the same

boundary condition but consider a more general and useful class of solutions for n(x,t).

Our governing equations are

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

¶ tn + ¶ x(nv) = 0,

¶ tv + v¶ xv = −(e/m)E,

¶ xE = (e/e 0)(n0 − n),

where E is the electric ﬁeld, e is the magnitude of the electron charge, m is the electron mass, and
e 0 is the vacuum dielectric constant. By eliminating the electric ﬁeld in (2) and (3) we immediately
ﬁnd the equation

¶ x(¶ tv + v¶ xv) = −w 2

p(1 − n/n0),

where w 2

p = n0e2/e 0m.

We shall below study a particular solution where n(x,t) and v(x,t) satisfy the system of two

coupled equations (1) and (4), and where v(±d,t) = 0. Our boundary condition means that the

electrons are always contained within the slab, and that R

d
−d n(x,t) dx accordingly is a constant
(= 2d n0). By means of straightforward calculations it is then easy to verify that a solution of (1)

and (4) is

and

where y(x,t) is given by the implicit relation

n(x,t) =

1 + k

′(y) cos(w pt)

,

n0

v(x,t) = −d w pk (y) sin(w pt),

x = d [y + k (y) cos(w pt)],

and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to y. Here k (y) is an arbitrary function satisfying
k (±1) = 0. We shall in the present paper choose the simple function k (y) = a y(1 − y2), where a
is a dimensionless constant. With this choice of k we note that (7) is a third order polynomial in

y, and that an analytical expression y(x,t) thus can be presented by solving

x = d [y + a y(1 − y2) cos(w pt)].

However, here we do not give the explicit expression for y(x,t). Other choices of k

lead to more

elaborate expressions for y(x,t) and will therefore not be considered. Corresponding to (8), (5)

FIG. 1: Nonlinear periodic and symmetric density oscillations. To the left the normalized density n is plotted

and to the right the normalized velocity v is plotted, both as functions of the normalized length x for different

normalized times t, with a = −0.4. At t = 0 the maximum density can be seen at x = 0. When a > 0 we

have the same dynamics shifted by a quarter of a period.

and (6) now reduce to

and

n(x,t) =

n0
1 + a (1 − 3y2) cos(w pt)

,

v(x,t) = −d w pa y(1 − y2) sin(w pt).

We note that n(±d, 0) = n0/(1 − 2a ). With the normalization n → n/n0, v → v/d w p, x → x/d,
t → w pt, and d → 1 we plot the density and velocity proﬁles for different times. One can then verify
that the total number of electrons is conserved during the oscillations. First, when 0 < a < 1/2 we
show (in the left panel of Fig. 1) n(x,t) for different normalized times t, using a = −0.4. We note

the symmetric and oscillating character of n. The corresponding velocity proﬁle v(x,t) can be seen
in the right panel of Fig. 1. For these regular oscillations, the sign of a characterizes the initial
value of the electron density n(x, 0): when a > 0 we start with higher edge density at x = ±d,
while for a < 0 the density has an initial spatial maximum at x = 0.

The denominator in (9) can approach zero at a ﬁnite time t0, resulting in explosive growth. Due

to the symmetric character of the density distribution the explosion for t = t0 will either be at (a)

the edges of the slab (x = ±d, i.e. y = ±1) or (b) at the centre of the slab (x = 0, i.e. y = 0). In
the case (a), the explosion time t0 is given by cos(w pt0) = 1/2a and |a | > 1/2, while in case (b)
the explosion time is found from cos(w pt0) = −1/a and |a | > 1. Thus, in case (b) we can have

FIG. 2: Explosive instability and wave breaking. To the left the normalized density n is plotted and to

the right the normalized velocity v is plotted, both as functions of the normalized length x for different

normalized times t, with a = −0.8. At t = 0 the density is focused but ﬁnite at x = 0. As the system evolves

we can see wave breaking and density spikes developing at the edges of the slab. Here the case a > 0 is no

longer associated with a simple phase shift, since wave breaking then occurs at t = 0.

explosive growth both at the edges and at the centre, depending on the initial conditions, while this

it not necessarily true for case (a). The explosive instability occurs in the wave-breaking regime,
and our cold plasma model thus breaks down at this stage (see Fig. 2). A change of sign of a shifts
the density distribution by half a period. Note however that a > 0 gives rise to unphysical initial

conditions, i.e. n(±d, 0) < 0.

III. CONCLUSION

In the present paper we have generalized the work of Aliev and Stenﬂo (1994) to allow for

a class of solutions where the electron density n(x,t) is an explicit, and comparatively simple,

function of x. We have presented ﬁgures which show the behavior of the solutions for different

initial values n(x, 0). From those solutions we can very clearly see that n(x,t) has an oscillating
behavior when 0 < |a | < 1/2, while if |a | > 1/2 we have explosive growth, i.e. n grows like
1/(t − t0)2 where the explosion time t0 is of the order 1/aw
can be generalized to cold many-component plasmas (Amiranashvili et al., 2002), to plasmas

p. We think that the present solution

where n0 is a function of x (Stenﬂo and Gradov, 1990; Karimov, 2002), to cylindrical plasmas

5

(Stenﬂo and Yu, 1997; Karimov, 2005), to Pierce beam plasma systems (Matsumoto, Yokohama,

and Summers, 1996), as well as to other kind of plasmas (Vladimirov, Yu, and Tsytovich, 1994).

Alternative solutions are of course also possible (Polyakov, 1995).

Our governing equations are easily generalized to the relativistic case by replacing Eq. (2) by
¶ t p + v¶ x p = −eE, where p = mv/p1 − v2/c2, c is the velocity of light, and m is the electron rest

mass. At present we have however not been able to generalize (5) and (6) to the relativistic case,
and we have therefore limited our presentation to the regime dw p ∼ v ≪ c. The opposite limit is
of course also of much interest, but it has to be delegated to future numerical work.

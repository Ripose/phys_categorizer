Plasmon mechanism of light transmission through a metal ﬁlm or a plasma layer

Yu.P. Bliokh
Department of Physics, Technion, 32000 Haifa, Israel

It is shown that a smooth metal ﬁlm (or a plasma layer) can be made transparent for an elec-
tromagnetic wave when two identical subwavelength diﬀraction gratings are placed on both sides of
the ﬁlm. The electromagnetic wave transmission through the metal ﬁlm is caused by excitation of
evanescent surface waves (plasmons) and their transformation into propagating waves at the grat-
ings. A model which is developed analytically shows that the problem of the wave transmission
is physically equivalent to the problem of excitation of two coupled resonators of evanescent waves
which are formed at the two ﬁlm surfaces.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The anomalous transmission of light through period-
ically perforated metal ﬁlms has recently attracted en-
hanced attention due to the fundamental signiﬁcance of
this eﬀect and to its numerous possible applications, e. g.
in optoelectronics, subwavelength lithography etc. It has
been shown for the ﬁrst time in Ref. 1 that a periodic
set of subwavelength holes enhances at some frequencies
the transparency of an optically thick ﬁlm by several or-
ders of magnitude. It was pointed out in this paper that
this phenomenon can be related to resonance excitation
of surface waves – plasmons – at the metal surface.

Plasmons can be excited at a smooth dielectric-metal
boundary by an incident electromagnetic wave when the
wave is totally internally reﬂected at a near-boundary in-
homogeneity of the dielectric permittivity2,3,4,5. An ar-
tiﬁcial periodical (e. g. corrugated or perforated) or nat-
ural accidental inhomogeneity of a metal boundary also
allows the excitation of plasmons by an incident elec-
tromagnetic wave. Wood’s paper6 of 1902 can be con-
sidered as the starting moment for investigations in this
direction.
In spite of such a long history this problem
continues to attract attention (see, e. g.,7,8,9,10,11).

There have been many theoretical works which sug-
gest models that try to clarify the physical mechanism
that is responsible for the anomalous light transmission
through the perforated metal ﬁlm. Considerable part
of these works is based on results of numerical simu-
lations (see, e. g.,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21) and only
some of them propose analytical investigations8,23,24,25.
Most of the authors share the opinion that the enhanced
transparency of the perforated metal ﬁlm is accompa-
nied by excitation of plasmons. However, various au-
thors consider diﬀerent mechanisms of coupling between
the plasmons on both surfaces of the ﬁlm, which is the
key element for the electromagnetic wave transmission.
In Ref.15, for example, the holes are considered as sub-
wavelength cavities for evanescent waves coupling the
plasmons on either side of the ﬁlm. The theory devel-
oped in Ref.14 considers coupling of the plasmons through
the evanescent electromagnetic modes in the holes which
are treated as subwavelength waveguides. In Ref.17 the
enhanced transparency is explained by interference of
diﬀracted evanescent waves.

Other authors consider the holes in the ﬁlm as
a periodical inhomogeneity of the metal surface9,18,19
or as a periodical modulation of the metal dielectric
permittivity8,23,24.
In these models plasmons on both
sides of the ﬁlm are coupled due to the overlapping of
their ﬁelds in the metal body and periodical modula-
tion of the surfaces or of the dielectric permittivity is
necessary for coupling between incident and transmitted
electromagnetic waves and plasmons.

It is appropriate to mention here that there are also
diametrically opposite points of view on the role of plas-
mons in the electromagnetic wave transmittance through
the perforated (or corrugated) metal ﬁlm. On the one
hand, it is asserted in Ref.20 that the excitation of plas-
mons decreases the transparency of the ﬁlm. On the
other hand, it is shown in Ref.16 that excitation of sur-
face waves, whatever its nature (spoof plasmons22 or
Brewster-Zennek modes21, for example), and not only
plasmons, leads to the increase of the ﬁlm transparency.

We do not set ourselves to clarify the contribution of
one or another physical mechanism in the transparency
enhancement as an object of this work. In this paper we
do present a simple model which allows us to investigate
analytically the plasmon mechanism of light transmission
through an optically thick metal ﬁlm. In order to exclude
any other possible mechanism we consider a construction
which is noticeably simple for analytical description and
in which only the plasmon mechanism is possible.
In-
stead of a perforated ﬁlm, a smooth metal ﬁlm with two
diﬀraction grids placed on both sides of the ﬁlm are con-
sidered. Besides the considerable simpliﬁcation of the
analytical description and the clear physical treatment of
the electrodynamical properties of this “sandwich”, such
a construction may possess some technological merits.

The metal ﬁlm is an open (not bounded by walls) res-
onator of surface waves. In the absence of dissipation,
the resonator Q-factor is inﬁnitely large. The resonator
excitation by an external source results in a signiﬁcant
growth of an eigenmode amplitude. Since the eigenmode
ﬁelds are concentrated near both sides of the ﬁlm, the
eigenmode amplitude growth leads to an increase of the
ﬁelds at the opposite side of the ﬁlm with respect to
the source position that can be regarded as an anoma-
lous ﬁlm transparency. The aim of this work is to show
that such interpretation of the anomalous transparency

is not only a convenient model, but also reﬂects ade-
quately the physics of the process. The resonator proper-
ties – eigenfrequencies and geometry of eigenmodes ﬁelds
– completely, qualitatively and quantitatively, determine
the dependence of the ﬁlm transparency on the system
parameters.

II. HOW A METAL FILM CAN BE MADE
TRANSPARENT FOR LIGHT?

Let us start from the simplest problem considering a
plane monochromatic electromagnetic wave incidence at
a vacuum-metal interface. The electromagnetic proper-
ties of the metal will be described by its dielectric per-
p/ω2, where ωp and ω
mittivity (Drude model) εp = 1 − ω2
are the metal electron plasma frequency and the incident
wave frequency, respectively. In this approximation there
is no diﬀerence between a metal ﬁlm and a plasma layer
and we will use both these terms as synonyms. Let us
assume that the z-axis is directed along the interface nor-
mal, the x-axis lies in the plane of incidence and the metal
occupies a right-hand half-space. The incident wave ﬁelds
are proportional to exp(ikxx + ikzz − iωt), where ~k is
the wave vector. The reﬂected and the refracted wave
ﬁelds are proportional to exp(ikxx − ikzz − iωt) and
exp(ikxx + ikpzz − iωt) correspondingly. Here kpz =
x is the z-component of the wave vector in the
metal and k0 = ω/c. Dissipation processes in the metal
p
will be neglected.

k2
0εp − k2

When the wave frequency ω is smaller than the plasma
frequency ω < ωp, then the z-component of the wave
vector in the plasma, kpz, is imaginary for an arbitrary
value of kx, i. e.
the refracted wave decays exponen-
tially deep into the plasma and its amplitude decreases as
exp(−|kpz|z). If the plasma occupies a whole half-space
z > 0, then the incident wave energy is completely trans-
mitted to the refracted wave energy. If the plasma layer
thickness hp, is a ﬁnite quantity, then the wave passes
partially through the plasma but the transmitted wave
amplitude is exponentially small, ∼ exp(−|kpz|hp).

The plasma permittivity is negative, εp < 0, when ω <
ωp. As is well known, along the interface between two
media in which the dielectric permittivities have opposite
signs, a surface electromagnetic wave can propagate. The
surface wave ﬁelds decay exponentially on either side of
the interface. The magnetic ﬁeld of this wave is parallel
to the interface plane. Let the y-axis be directed along
the magnetic ﬁeld of the wave. The dispersion relation for
the surface wave propagating along the vacuum-plasma
boundary can be written in the form:

= 1.

It is not diﬃcult to show that Eq. (1) possesses a real
solution kx(ω) if ω2 < ω2
p/2. This solution corresponds
to an undamped wave – surface plasmon – propagating
along the interface.

(1)

The surface wave phase velocity ω/kx is directed along
the interface and is less than the speed of light c. As a
result, this wave cannot be excited by an incident propa-
gating electromagnetic wave. The surface wave can be ex-
cited by an “incident” nonpropagating (evanescent) wave
for which k2
In this case the term “incident”
means the wave whose amplitude decays exponentially as
0z) on approaching the interface from a
∼ exp(−
source placed in the half-space z < 0.

Let us assume that the magnetic ﬁeld of the evanescent
incident wave is directed along the y-axis and is equal to
H1 exp(−kz), and the magnetic ﬁelds of the surface wave
on either side of the interface, in the z < 0 and z > 0
half-spaces, are equal to H2 exp(+kz) and H3 exp(−kpz),
x − k2
k2
respectively. Here k =
0 and
a common factor exp(ikxx − iωt) is omitted. Using the
standard boundary conditions it is easy to express the
amplitudes H2 and H3 in terms of H1:

1 − kp/(k|εp|)

.

(2)

Equations (2) contain a resonance denominator whose
zero coincides with a root of the dispersion equation (1).
The physical meaning of these formulae is very simple:
the interface forms an original resonator whose eigen-
mode is the surface wave. In the model under consider-
ation (dissipationless and unbounded in the x and y di-
rections) the resonator energy loss is equal to zero. The
incident wave H1 plays the role of an external force (a
pump mode), therefore the amplitude of oscillations in
the resonator increases without limit when the incident
wave frequency approaches the resonator eigenfrequency.
When plasma occupies the space between two planes
z = 0 and z = hp, then the second surface forms the same
resonator. The resonators on either sides of the plasma
layer are connected by ﬁelds which decay exponentially
inward the plasma body. Therefore the resonators cou-
pling coeﬃcient is small (it is assumed that kphp ≫ 1).
A coupling of two identical resonators leads to eigenfre-
quency splitting into two frequencies which are shifted
proportionally to the coupling coeﬃcient. These eigen-
frequencies correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric
eigenmodes relative to the layer center.

Such a binary resonator can be excited in the same
way as the single one, by an external nonpropagating
electromagnetic wave. Solving the propblem of such a
wave passing through the plasma layer, one can obtain
the expression for the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude Htr of
the transmitted wave on the other side of the layer, in
the region z > hp:

Htr =

The equation D0 = 0 is the dispersion equation whose
roots determine the eigenfrequencies of the coupled res-
onators. Thus, in this case too the wave ﬁeld ampli-
tude approaches inﬁnity when the pump wave frequency
reaches one of the two eigenfrequencies of the binary res-
onator.

If it were not a conditional application of “incident
wave” and “transmitted wave” conceptions to the evanes-
cent waves, it would be possible to interpret expression
(3) not only as wave transmission through the plasma
layer, but also as wave “ampliﬁcation” by the layer. The
“perfect lens” eﬀect26 is accounted for exactly by such
“ampliﬁcation” of evanescent waves by a left-handed ma-
terial slab27,28,29,30,31.

In order to obtain real transmission of a propagating
wave through the plasma layer it is necessary to trans-
form (partially or completely) this wave into an evanes-
cent one and to make an inverse transformation behind
the layer. Since, as it follows from Eq. (3), the evanescent
wave amplitude can be very large, essential enhancement
of the wave transmission is expected even if the transfor-
mation coeﬃcient is small.

A one- or two-dimensional diﬀraction grating is a sim-
ple “transformer” of propagating and evanescent waves
one into another. A wave incident at the grating gives
rise to a set of reﬂected and refracted waves whose wave
vectors projections ~k⊥n,m at the grating plane diﬀer
from the projection ~k⊥ of the wave vector of the inci-
dent wave by an integer number of grating vectors ~kg1,2 :
~k⊥n,m = ~k⊥ + n~kg1 + m~kg2 , n, m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . ..

Secondary waves for which k⊥n,m < k0, are propagat-
ing waves, and waves for which k⊥n,m > k0 are evanes-
cent waves. The last ones are localized near the grating
plane and decay exponentially, moving away from the
grating.
Independently of the incident wave polariza-
tion there are, in the general case, such evanescent waves
whose magnetic ﬁeld have non-zero projection onto the
grating plane. These waves can excite the surface wave
resonator.

Thus it is expected that the plasma layer transparency
for an electromagnetic wave, whose frequency is smaller
than the plasma frequency, can be enhanced essentially
when on each side of the layer two diﬀraction gratings
are placed. It will be shown below that the transparency
of such a “sandwich” reaches 100%.

III. THE DIFFRACTION GRATING MODEL

In the general case only one of the evanescent waves
scattered on the grating can be used for the resonator
excitation. The contribution of all other non-resonant
waves in the interaction of the incident wave with the
system under consideration is small and will be neglected
below. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may con-
sider the grating to be one-dimensional and regard the
magnetic ﬁelds of the incident and scattered waves as ly-

3

ing in the grating plane and being perpendicular to the
grating inverse wave vector.

The following dimensionless variables will be used be-
low: ξ = xωp/c, ζ = zωp/c, Ω = ω/ωp. The wave num-
bers (real or imaginary) of wave spatial harmonics will
be normalized to ωp/c and designated in the vacuum and
in the plasma as q and κ, respectively.

Suppose that on each side of a plasma layer, which is
situated between the planes ζ = dg and ζ = dg + dp, two
diﬀraction gratings are placed in the planes ζ = 0 and
ζ = 2dg + dp (see Fig. 1). In order to avoid cumbersome
expressions we will assume that the gratings are identical
and placed at the same distances dg from the plasma
boundaries, and the grating wave vector ~qg is directed
along the ξ axis.

Let us consider a plane electromagnetic wave passing
through the grating-plasma-grating (GPG) system. It is
assumed that the wave falls from left to right on the GPG
system, the wave vector of the incident wave lies in the
ξ, ζ plane and the wave magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the
gratings planes.

FIG. 1: Plasma layer between two diﬀraction gratings.

The problem of a transmission coeﬃcient calculation
for a system with one or another shape of grating lies out
of the framework of this paper. Therefore we will use the
following simple model of wave scattering at a diﬀraction
grating. Let us consider a modiﬁed wave equation for the
wave magnetic ﬁeld:

∂2H
∂ζ2 +

∂2H
∂ξ2 + Ω2H + δ(ζ) (ε0 + 2ε1 cos kgξ) H = 0. (5)

Eq. (5) describes the wave passing through a δ-shaped
layer situated in the ζ = 0 plane. The layer permit-
tivity is varied harmonically in the ξ-direction. Such a
layer posesses all the properties of a diﬀraction grating
and therefore will be used for the description of waves
scattering at the grating. The harmonic rule of the per-
mittivity variation does not restrict the model general-
ity, because, as it was mentioned above, the anomalous
transparency of the plasma layer is connected with the
excitation of a surface wave which is resonant with one

of the spatial harmonics of the wave passing through the
grating. Therefore, only one harmonic of the permittiv-
ity variation plays a key role. The contribution of all the
other harmonics is negligibly small and will be neglected
further.

The parameters ε0 and ε1 describe diﬀerent proper-
ties of the grating. The parameter ε0 determines the
mean transparency of the grating. The parameter ε1
determines the coeﬃcient referred above of the mutual
transformation of the propagating and evanescent spatial
harmonics of the waves. Since the last parameter plays
In
the key role, we can suppose at ﬁrst that ε0 = 0.
accordance with Flouqet theorem let us look for Eq. (5)
solution in the form:

IV. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE
TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE GPG
SYSTEM: A WAVE THEORY

Ω2 − q2

Let the incident wave frequency be Ω. The wave
magnetic ﬁeld has the form H1,0eiqξξ+iq0ζ, where q0 =
ξ . For the sake of simplicity let us assume that
q
the grating period is less than the wavelength, i. e. all
the spatial harmonics with n 6= 0 in Eq. (6) are evanes-
cent. Only two harmonics are of interest for the problem:
the zero harmonic because the total energy ﬂux behind
the second grating is concentrated only in it, and one

4

from the evanescent harmonics with n 6= 0 (let it will be
n = +1 for deﬁniteness) which can play the pump mode
role for the surface waves resonator. The contribution of
all the other harmonics will be neglected below.

The system of waves and their harmonics which have
to be taken into account for the transmission coeﬃcient
calculation, is shown in Fig. 2. The harmonic amplitudes
will be marked by two indices. The ﬁrst one corresponds
to the wave number and the second one corresponds to
the harmonic number. The propagation direction of the
corresponding wave is marked by an arrow. As the “prop-
agation direction” for the evanescent wave, the direction
of its amplitude decrease is chosen. The propagating
waves are represented by horisontal lines and the evanes-
cent waves are represented by conventional curves which
fall along the direction of the wave amplitude decrease.

FIG. 2: System of waves and their harmonics.

Using standard boundary conditions at the vacuum-
plasma interface and the condition (7) at the gratings,
let us exclude all internal waves and leave only equations
which allow connecting the amplitudes of the reﬂected
(H2,0 and H2,1) and transmitted (H9,0 and H9,1) wave
harmonics with the incident wave amplitude H1,0. These
equations are the following:

The function D0 is determined by Eq. (4). The coeﬃ-

ter ε1 are placed diagonally, and two anti-diagonal blocks
which are proportional to ε1. Therefore for ε1 = 0 the
system (8) is split into two independent systems for prop-
agating (with index 0) and evanescent (with index 1) har-
monics. For ε1 = 0 a non-trivial solution for the prop-
agated harmonics is possible only in the presence of the
external wave H0,1 (coeﬃcient α22 6= 0 always). However
a non-trivial solution for the evanescent waves exists even
when the external wave is absent. This solution exists if
the determinant of the lower 2 × 2 block is equal to zero,
or:

is the case of the most interest. The coeﬃcient A deter-
mines the amplutude of the wave transmitted through
the plasma when the gratings are absent. This coef-
ﬁcient is exponentially small, A ∼ e−κ0dp ≪ 1. Here

For small but ﬁnite ε1 ≪ 1 the system (8) determi-

It means that at a

frequency which is close to one of the surface waves res-
onator eigenfrequencies, the transmission coeﬃcient de-
ﬁned as |H9,0/H1,0| can be anomalously large.

Considering µ1 and µ2 as small, one can easily derive
from Eq. (8) the following expression for the amplitude

For ε1 ≪ 1 the amplitude H9,0 is maximal when the
wave frequency is close to one of the resonator eigenfre-

tion roots, D0(Ωres) = 0. The condition exp(−κ0dp) ≪ 1
means that also exp(−κ1dp) ≪ 1 and that the disper-
sion equation roots are exponentially close to the roots
of the equation B−(Ω) = 0. Therefore, one may put
q1|εp|/κ1 ≃ 1 everywhere, except for B−, and write the
expression for the amplitude H9,0 in the form:

It is easy to see that the module of expression (13) is
maximal at the frequency which is determined by the con-
= 0 and reaches
dition Re
unity. In other words the transmission coeﬃcient of an
electromagnetic wave through the GPG system reaches
100% at frequencies which are close to the surface waves
resonator eigenfrequencies, and it does not depend on the
value of the coeﬃcient ε1. This coeﬃcient determines
only the bandwidth of the resonant transparency.

i

(cid:1)

The independence of the upper limit of the transmis-
sion coeﬃcient from the value of the coeﬃcient ε1, if it
is small enough, conﬁrms the statement that a concrete
shape of a grating does not play an essential part. Vari-
ous gratings, one- or two-dimensional, diﬀer one from an-
other by the value of the coeﬃcient ε1, which describes a
transformation of the incident propagating wave into the
evanescent mode that excites the resonator.

These results of the approximate expression (13) anal-
ysis are conﬁrmed by a numerical solution of the sys-
tem (8). The dependencies of the transmission coeﬃ-
cient K = |H9,0/H1,0| on the dimensionless frequency Ω
for various values of the parameter ε1 are presented in
Fig. 3. For convenience, the dependencies K(Ω − Ω(0)
res)
are shown. Here Ω(0)
res are the roots of the dispersion
equation (1) for the isolated resonator. As it follows from

6

For small ε1 the dependence K(Ω) has the form of
two reﬂection-symmetric Fano resonance proﬁles32, that
is caused by interference between the two terms in the
right-hand side of Eq. 10. The ﬁrst term describes a non-
resonant transmission of the wave through the plasma
layer, the second one describes resonance transmission
caused by the plasmons excitation33. When ε1 increases,
the Q-factor of the surface waves resonator decreases (see
next section), which in turn leads to broadening of the
resonance frequency bands. The overlapping of band-
widths of two resonances makes the role of non-rasonance
transmission negligibly small and the dependence K(Ω)
acquires the typical form of two coupled resonators.

VI. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE
TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE GPG SYSTEM
AS A RESONATOR EXCITATION

The fact that the peak value of the transmission coef-
ﬁcient for small ε1 ≪ 1 does not depend on the value of
this parameter, has a simple explanation. The Q-factor
of the resonator of the surface waves is determined by
the energy ﬂux out of the resonator. This ﬂux is com-
pletely concentrated in the propagating waves. These
waves arise at the diﬀraction gratings due to transfor-
mation of the evanescent waves, which are the eigen-
modes of the resonator, into the propagating waves. The
transformation coeﬃcient is proportional to ε1. The res-
onator ﬁeld amplitude at the grating is proportional to
∼ e−q1dg . Thus, the energy ﬂux out of the resonator is

proportional to ∼ ε2
is inversely proportional to this value, Q−1
1e−2q1dg .
Further, the resonator pumping is carried out by the non-
propagating harmonic, which appears due to the external
wave incidence at the ﬁrst grating. This harmonic am-
plitude is proportional to ∼ ε1H1,0. The eﬃciency of an
arbitrary resonator excitation by an external ﬁeld Ψext(ζ)
is deﬁned by the projection hΨextΨ∗
resi of this ﬁeld onto
the resonator eigenmode ﬁeld Ψres(ζ). In the case under
consideration Ψext ∼ ε1H1,0e−q1ζ, Ψres(ζ) ∼ eq1(ζ−dg ),

the dependencies presented in Fig. 3, the plasmons exci-
tation can lead not only to the transmission coeﬃcient
enhancement but to its suppression too. For small ε1
(thick curve ε1 = 0.02 in Fig. 3) the transmission coeﬃ-
cient in the close vicinity of the resonance frequencies can
be much smaller than the transmission coeﬃcient of the
isolated plasma layer. In the model being used the plas-
mons excitation is the only mechanism which is respon-
sible for the layer transparency enhancement. Therefore
the ﬁlm transparency suppression in some frequency re-
gions cannot be used as an argument against the plasmon
mechanism of the transparency enhancement (see17,20).

The steady-state amplitude A0 of the oscillations in
a resonator with a ﬁnite Q-factor is determined by the
expression:

(14)

Eq. (14) has just the same structure as Eq. (13). The
peak value of the transmission coeﬃcient, as it follows
from Eq. (14), is about unity and does not depend on
the parameter ε1. Note, that in the estimations pre-
sented above of the resonator Q-factor and the resonator
pumping eﬃciency the plasma thickness does not appear.
It means that nominally an arbitrary thick metal ﬁlm
(plasma layer) can be made transparent using the con-
struction under consideration.

The surface wave resonator properties are changed
when diﬀraction gratings are placed near the plasma
layer. Not only a ﬁnite Q-factor appears, as it was shown
above, but the resonator eigenfrequencies are shifted as
well. The frequency shift can be determined in the fol-
lowing way.

The dispersion equation Eq. (4) follows from standard
boundary conditions at a vacuum-plasma interface. At
the same time, from two possible solutions of the Maxwell
equations in vacuum, only such a solution is chosen that
decreases exponentially upon leaving the plasma bound-
ary. This condition can be written as a Sommerfeld’s
condition analogue for evanescent waves:

dH/dζ|dg−0 − q1 H|dg−0 = 0,
dH/dζ|dg+dp+0 + q1 H|dg+dp+0 = 0.

(15)

In the presence of the gratings the conditions (15) are
no longer satisﬁed. The “medium” at the left and at
the right from the plasma boundaries can now be char-
acterized by the surface impedance Z and the boundary
conditions analogous to Eq. (15) take the form:

dH/dζ|dg−0 + iΩZ H|dg −0 = 0,
dH/dζ|dg +dp+0 − iΩZ H|dg+dp+0 = 0.

Let us calculate the impedance considering, for exam-
ple, the left plasma boundary. As it is represented in
Fig. (4), the wave (4, 1) which “leaks” from the plasma is
scattered at the grating and additional waves appear. Ne-
glecting the wave (3, 0) transmission through the plasma
layer, it is possible to consider that this wave is almost
reﬂected from the boundary and is transformed into the
wave (4, 0). Using Eq. (7), one can connect the ampli-
tudes of the waves (4, 1) and (3, 1) at the plasma bound-
ary:

FIG. 4: Resonator boundary impedance calculation.

where α is the phase shift under the wave (3, 0) reﬂection.

At the plasma boundary the total magnetic ﬁeld H1 of
a spatial harmonic, which is proportional to ∼ exp[i(qξ +
qg)ξ], is equal to H3,1 + H4,1. The tangential compo-
nent of the electric ﬁeld of this harmonic, Eξ1, is equal
to −(i/Ω)q1(H4,1 − H3,1). Thus, as it follows from the
impedance deﬁnition Z = −Eξ1/H1 (the surface normal
is directed oppositely to the ξ-axis) and from Eq. (17):

The impedance (18) is a complex quantity. The
imaginary part of the impedance is responsible for the
eigenfrequency shift and the real part describes the res-
onator loss. Since the impedance imaginary parts of the
“medium” with and without grating diﬀer from one an-
other by the value

the resonator eigenfrequency shift is proportional to ∼ ε2

for small ε1.

If the impedance of the “medium” surrounding the
plasma layer is known, the resonator properties can be
deﬁned more precisely than it was done before.

Using the boundary conditions at the vacuum-plasma
interface and the conditions (16), which can be rewritten
in the form:

dH/dζ|dg −0 + q∗ H|dg−0 = 0,
dH/dζ|dg +dp+0 − q∗ H|dg +dp+0 = 0,

The expression in the square brackets coinsides exactly

The dependence of the resonator eigenfrequencies on
the grating transparency, which is characterized by the

putting ε1 = 0. Replacing the second equation in (7) by
the boundary condition

When the plasma layer is rather thick, exp(κ1dp) ≫ 1,
then the roots of the dispersion equation (23) are close to
the roots of the ﬁrst preexponential factor and Eq. (23)

Let us restrict ourselves to the case when the grat-
ings are situated close to the plasma surfaces34, when
exp(q1dg) ≃ 1. Using the deﬁnitions of the functions

It is easy to see that the roots Ωres of the dispersion
equation (25) decrease with the growth of ε0 and reach
zero for ε0 = qξ + qg. For ε0 > qξ + qg Eq. (25) has
no real roots. This dependence Ωres(ε0), which has been

obtained numerically from Eq. (23), is presented in Fig. 5.

The resonator considered above is a resonator of
evanescent waves, therefore for ε1 = 0 its Q-factor is
inﬁnitely large. For ε1 6= 0 the transformation of the
evanescent waves into the propagating ones makes the
resonator Q-factor ﬁnite and allows the excitation of the
resonator by an external propagating wave. As in the
case for ε0 = 0, the GPG system transparency can reach
100% when the incident wave frequency is close to one
of the resonator eigenfrequencies Ωres. The dependence
Ωres(ε0) described above is fully conﬁrmed by the nu-
merical solution of the system (8). For example the de-
pendencies K(Ω) for several values of ε0 marked by the
vertical lines in Fig. 5, are presented in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6 also demonstrates that the eigenfrequencies of
the plasma layers which are either isolated (ε0 = 0) or
surrounded by gratings can diﬀer greatly and this diﬀer-
ence cannot be treated as an argument against the plas-
mon mechanism of the transparency enhancement, as it
was done, for example, in Ref.15.

VII. CONCLUSION

The merit of the suggested model is that all other pos-
sible mechanisms (waveguide connection between the ﬁlm
surfaces through small holes, action of holes as subwave-
length cavities for the evanescent waves, interference of
diﬀracted evanescent waves, etc.) of the electromagnetic
wave transmission through a perforated or corrugated

9

dence angle for which the ﬁlm transparency is maximal.
The resonator mechanism can be considered as one
of possible competitive mechanisms of light transmission
through a perforated metal ﬁlm. A periodically inhomo-
geneous ﬁlm surface can be considered as a diﬀraction
grating situated directly at the ﬁlm surface, and holes
can be considered as an additional channel of connec-
tion between the resonators at the two opposite ﬁlm sur-
faces. The analysis of the dependence of the resonator
eigenfrequencies on the system parameters shows that the
eigenfrequencies of a smooth ﬁlm and the grating-plasma-
grating system can be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Therefore
even a strong deviation of the frequency, which corre-
sponds to the transparency peak, from the plasma layer
(metal ﬁlm) eigenfrequency, cannot be unambiguously
treated as a sign of another, diﬀerent from the resonator,
mechanism of electromagnetic wave transmission through
the metal ﬁlm.

wave frequency for several values of ε0: (a) ε0 = 0.1, (b)

metal ﬁlm are absent a priori. Excitation of the sur-
face waves resonator is the only mechanism in this model
which is responsible for the electromagnetic wave trans-
mission through a metal ﬁlm. The knowledge of the res-
onator properties is suﬃcient for determining how the
GPG system parameters aﬀect the frequency and inci-

34 When the gratings are situated rather far from the plasma
surfaces so that q1dg ≥ 1, then an extra pair of roots ap-
pears. These additional roots do not disappear for ε0 → ∞
and in some range of ε0 variation, four roots can exist si-
multaneously. The transmission coeﬃcient K is extremal
in the roots locations. In the considered frequency range

and for q1dg ≥ 1 one more mechanism exists, which is not
connected with the surface waves resonator and also leads
to the plasma layer transparency. The overall picture of
the wave transmission is more complex in this case and
will not be considered here.

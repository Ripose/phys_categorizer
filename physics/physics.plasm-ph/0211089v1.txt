Abstract.

the
We brieﬂy examine the properties of dense plasmas characteristic of
atmospheres of neutron stars and of the interior of massive white dwarfs. These
astrophysical bodies are natural laboratories to study respectively the problem of
pressure ionization of hydrogen in a strong magnetic ﬁeld and the crystallization of
the quantum one-component-plasma at ﬁnite temperature.

1. Introduction

The quest for an accurate description of the thermodynamics properties of dense plasmas
has represented a thriving domain of research since the seminal review by Baus and
Hansen (1980). The interiors of many astrophysical bodies are characterized by strongly
correlated ionic and electronic plasmas, with respective classical and quantum coupling
parameters Γi = β(Zie)2/ai and rs = ai/(a0Z
) varying over several decades. Here,
a0 = ¯h2/(mee2) denotes the electronic Bohr radius, ai = (3Ni/4πV )1/3 is the mean
inter-ionic distance, and β
1/(kBT ). The correct description of the thermodynamic
properties of these astrophysical bodies, which determine their mechanical and thermal
properties, thus requires the knowledge of the equation of state (EOS) of such plasmas.
In this short review, we focus on the case of neutron stars (NS) and massive white dwarfs
(WD), which exhibit two particularly interesting problems in the statistical physics of
dense matter.

the relationship between the photospheric and the interior temperature proﬁles. The
emitted spectra of these stars can be strongly aﬀected by the presence of bound species in
the photosphere. Since the atmosphere can be composed essentially of hydrogen accreted
from either the interstellar medium, the supernova remnant or a close companion,
the determination of the temperature proﬁles and spectra thus requires an accurate
description of hydrogen ionization in a strong magnetic ﬁeld.

The quantum-mechanical properties of protons, free electrons and bound species
(hydrogen atoms and molecules) are strongly modiﬁed by the ﬁeld, which thereby aﬀects
the thermodynamic properties of the plasma. The properties of matter in a magnetic
ﬁeld under NS conditions have been reviewed recently by Ventura and Potekhin (2001)
and Lai (2001). We refer the reader to these reviews for the detailed descriptions of
these properties, and only the most recent results will be outlined in the present paper.

is the quantum magnetic length, which becomes the natural length unit in the plasma
instead of a0.

The thermal motion of atoms causes the Stark eﬀect due to the electric ﬁeld
induced in the comoving frame of reference. At γ
1, this eﬀect strongly modiﬁes the
atomic properties: the atom becomes asymmetric, and its binding energy and oscillator
strengths depend on the velocity (Potekhin 1994). Two classes of the atomic states
arise: so-called centered and decentered states; for the latter ones the electron-proton
separation is large and the binding energy relatively small (Vincke et al 1992; Potekhin
1994).

The formation of molecules is also strongly modiﬁed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld.
Because of the alignment of the electron spins antiparallel to the ﬁeld, two atoms in their
ground state (m = 0) do not bind together, because of the Pauli exclusion principle.
One of the two H atoms has to be excited in the m =
1 state to form the ground state
of the H2 molecule, which then forms by covalent bonding (e.g., Lai, 2001).

the electron cyclotron energy ¯hωc exceeds both the thermal energy kBT and the electron
Fermi energy kBTF, so that the electrons are mostly in the Landau ground state, – i.e.,
the ﬁeld is strongly quantizing. In this case, typical for the NS photospheres, the electron
spins are aligned antiparallel to the ﬁeld.

Quantum-mechanical calculations of the binding energies and wave functions of
hydrogen atoms in any states of motion in the strong magnetic ﬁelds have been carried
out only recently (Vincke et al 1992; Potekhin, 1994). Using these results, Potekhin,
Chabrier and Shibanov (1999) derived a model which describes the thermodynamics of
an interacting (H2, H, H+, e−) plasma in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. This model is based
on the framework of the free energy model developed by Saumon and Chabrier (1991,
1992) for pressure ionization of hydrogen at B = 0, but generalizes it to the strong-B
case, taking into account the quantum-mechanical eﬀects caused by the thermal motion
of atoms across the magnetic ﬁeld.

Figure 2. EOS of partially ionized atomic hydrogen in the strong magnetic ﬁeld (solid
lines) compared with the EOS of a fully ionized ideal electron-proton plasma (dotted
lines) and the EOS of a partially ionized hydrogen at B = 0 (dashed lines). Left panel:
B = 1012 G, log T [K] = 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5. Right panel:
log T [K] = 6.5, B = 1012 G
and 1014 G. The vertical lines correspond to the density above which excited Landau
levels become populated

Figure 1 displays the logarithm of the fraction of H and H2 for a magnetic ﬁeld
B = 1014 G, for two isotherms. The solid line represents the total fraction of atoms
fH = nH/n0 (n0 = nH + np + 2nH2) in all quantum states, whereas the dashed line
shows the fraction of atoms in the ground state. The dotted line displays the zero-ﬁeld
result. As seen in this ﬁgure, the strong magnetic ﬁeld favours atomic and molecular
recombination. Since the binding energies of atoms and molecules increase and TF
decreases in the strongly quantizing magnetic ﬁeld, pressure ionization occurs at much
larger densities than for the ﬁeld-free case.

Figure 2 displays the resulting EOS. The left panel displays three isotherms at
B = 1012 G, typical of ordinary NS. On the right panel, we compare the isotherm
T = 106.5 K for B = 1012 G and for the superstrong ﬁeld B = 1014 G. As expected from
the previous discussion, the EOS in a strong magnetic ﬁeld diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the
ﬁeld-free case in the region of partial ionization. At very high-density, excited Landau
levels become populated, due to the increase of the Fermi energy, and the zero-ﬁeld case
is recovered.

A simpliﬁed determination of this curve is based on the Lindeman critical
parameter interpolation between the zero-temperature and the classical melting values
(Mochkovitch and Hansen 1979; Chabrier 1993). These calculations, however, are based
on a harmonic description of the phonon mode spectrum and thus do not include non-
harmonic eﬀects. More recently, Jones and Ceperley (1996) performed Path Integral
Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to try to determine the phase diagram more correctly.
They found a maximum melting temperature almost a factor of 2 larger than the one
determined by Chabrier (1993).

In this paper, we present preliminary results based on similar PIMC calculations
at ﬁnite temperature. The system under consideration consists of N identical, but
distinguishable particles (Boltzmannions) with a mass M and charge Ze in a volume V
at temperature T .

for a given RS, the energy tends towards the zero-temperature limit (Chabrier, 1993).
The dash-line displays an analytical ﬁt of the PIMC energy at large Γ (Douchin and
Chabrier, 2002).

Our preliminary results yield melting temperatures lower than the ones obtained by
Jones and Ceperley (1996), about a factor of 2 for the maximum melting temperature.
This diﬀerence stems from a better correction of ﬁnite-size eﬀects, which are known to
stabilize the solid. First of all, we explored more in detail the N-dependence of our
PIMC simulations by conducting calculations with a larger number of particles (up to
N=256). Second of all, we found out that the dependence on Γ and RS of the ﬁnite-
size eﬀects for the liquid phase is more complex than the simple one used by Jones

Dense astrophysical plasmas

and Ceperley (1996). This is particularly important for the extrapolated values of the
energy around the turning point. The obtained maximum melting temperature and
corresponding density are (Douchin and Chabrier, 2002)

Tmax = 8810 A Z 4 K;

ρm = 1280 A4 Z 6 g cm−3,

i.e., RS ≈

235 .

(9)

These calculations show that, although anharmonic eﬀects are non-negligible both
in the solid and in the liquid phase, they are comparable in both phases and almost
cancel out, so that the melting curve lies close to the one estimated from the harmonic
spectrum.

4. Conclusion

In this short review, we have considered two diﬀerent problems related to dense plasma
physics as encountered under speciﬁc astrophysical conditions. Because of the presence
of a strong magnetic ﬁeld, the quantum internal levels of atoms and molecules are
quantized in Landau orbits, and the ﬁeld raises the binding energy of these species,
favoring recombination over dissociation and ionization compared with the ﬁeld-free
case. This modiﬁes the ionization equilibrium and EOS of the dense plasma.

We also considered the crystallization of a quantum ﬂuid of Boltzmannions at ﬁnite
temperature with PIMC simulations, taking into account the correction due to ﬁnite-
size eﬀects. We found that the crystallization diagram lies close to the one based on an
interpolation of the Lindeman criterium between the classical and the zero-temperature
limits. These preliminary results need to be conﬁrmed by further calculations. Such
work is under progress.

These two examples, and many other not mentioned in the present review, stress
the need for detailed calculations of the properties of dense plasmas under extreme
conditions for astrophysical applications.

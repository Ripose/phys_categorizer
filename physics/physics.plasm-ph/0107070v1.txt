Abstract

The formation of relativistic electron mirror produced via ioniza-
tion of thin solid target by ultraintense femtosecond laser pulse is
considered with the help of computer simulations. It is shown that
the reﬂection of weak counter-propagating wave from such a mirror
can produce the coherent radiation in x-ray and gamma-ray bands.
The spectrum of up-conversed radiation is investigated.

1 Introduction

Production of coherent short wavelength electromagnetic radiation in X-ray
and gamma-ray bands attracts great attention during last decades [1,2]. Dif-
ferent physical mechanisms have been considered as candidates for practical
implementation of this process: generation in free-electron lasers [3-5], X-ray
and γ-ray lasing [1,2,6-8], high optical harmonics generation in gases [9,10]
and solids [11-13], and others. Most of the schemes imply the use of the pow-
erful lasers as part of the system so the investigations received large impetus
last years due to experimental realization of ultraintense femtosecond laser
pulses [14]. In this paper we consider the Dopler up-conversion of laser light
into the X-ray or γ-ray bands with the help of relativistic electron mirror
produced during interaction of high intensity ultrashort optical pulse with
thin solid target in vacuum.

The idea for generation of high frequency coherent electromagnetic radi-
ation by Dopler transformation of the incident wave was proposed by Lan-
decker [15]. Actually when the light reﬂects from relativistic mirror its fre-
quency and amplitude increase by the factor (1 + v/c)/(1 − v/c), where v
is the velocity of the mirror and c is the light velocity. So for v/c ≈ 1 the

1

frequency increase can be very large. Additional beneﬁt of such scheme is its
tunability because the frequency of resulting radiation depends on the veloc-
ity of the mirror which can be simply adjusted. The only problem is how to
produce such a relativistic mirror. Obviously it have to be pure electronic
because ordinary neutral matter cannot be accelerated to ultrarelativistic ve-
locities in laboratory. The breakthrough in this problem became possible due
to experimental realization of femtosecond laser pulses of very high intensity.
During interaction of this pulse with thin foil the electrons of the latter can
be accelerated to ultrarelativistic velocities keeping the initial geometrical
form of the foil and constituting the required relativistic mirror.

Acceleration of electron bunch produced by ionization of thin solid target
with femtosecond laser pulse was considered in details in [16]. Here in section
1 we reproduce only the results which are important for the problem of light
up-conversion, in section 2 the process of light reﬂection from relativistic
electron mirror will be considered.

2 Formation of relativistic electron mirror

Let the medium is uniform in directions perpendicular to Oz axis. Then it can
be modeled by a set of parallel planes (electron sheets) with constant surface
density of electrons. Each plane is supposed to have inﬁnite dimensions in
x and y directions. If the movement of each plane is without rotations and
deformations then all variables depend only on coordinate z and time t and
the 1D3V model can be used for the system: the movement of the planes can
be described by three components of velocity βx = Vx/c, βy = Vy/c, βz = Vz/c
and one coordinate Z [17]. In present paper the analytical - numerical variant
of 1D3V model is used which reduces to the system of ordinary diﬀerential
equations with delay.

Charge density and current are described by the following formulas for

the electron sheet (σ is a surface charge density)

ρ(z, t) = σδ(z − Z(t))

j(z, t) = σv(t)δ(z − Z(t))

(1)

where Z(t) is z coordinate of a sheet. Then the solutions of Maxwell equa-
tions for the radiation ﬁelds of the medium at coordinate z and time t can
be obtained with the help of Green function and have the form [18]

2

Ez(z, t) = 2πσsign(z − Z(t′))

E⊥(z, t) = −2πσ

β⊥(t′)
1 − βz(t′)sign(z − Z(t′))

H(z, t) = 2πσsign(z − Z(t′))

[β⊥(t′), ez]
1 − βz(t′)sign(z − Z(t′))

(2)

where E⊥e = Exeex + Eyeey, v⊥ = vxex + vyey, β = v/c and t′ - is a retarded
time: c(t − t′) = |z − Z(t′)|. The resulting radiation ﬁeld Es, Hs for the
thin charged layer is the sum of radiation ﬁelds of all electron sheets (note
that the retarded time t′ is diﬀerent for diﬀerent sheets). Interaction of each
electron sheet with the radiation ﬁeld of the layer results in appearance of
self-action viscous force Fs = eEs + e [β, Hs], which modiﬁes the dynamics
of the sheet. This force is analogous to the Dirac force acting on the moving
electron.

The equations of motion for the electrons in the sheets have now the

following form

dp
dt

= eE + e [β, H] + Fs,

(3)

where e is the charge of the electron, p is relativistic momentum of electrons,
E and H are the external ﬁelds (it is supposed that these ﬁelds support the
geometry of electron medium).
It is worth to mention that the radiation
reaction force Fs have not only the transverse component but the longitu-
dinal component as well the last having essentially nonlinear character. For
inﬁnitely thin electron sheet the self action force is

Fs⊥ = −2πσeβ⊥,

Fsz = −2πσeβ2

⊥βz/(1 − β2

z ),

(4)

Let now consider the ultraintense plane electromagnetic wave with fre-
quency ω falling normally at the layer (wave vector k is parallel to the Oz
axis) so that an acceleration parameter of the wave α0 = eE0/(mωc) >> 1,
where m is the mass of an electron, E0 is the amplitude of the wave ﬁeld.
Then the electrons of the layer will accelerate in the z direction to ultrarel-
ativistic velocities just by the ﬁrst half wave keeping initial geometry of the
bunch [16].

Account for the layer radiation friction force give some interesting features
to the motion of the electrons inside the layer. First of all an additional

3

accelerating force emerges which constitutes the mean value of the Lorentz
force. Actually in this situation the mean Lorentz force is nonzero due to
the extra phase shift between the electromagnetic wave and the electrons’
velocities arising from the action of radiation friction force (scattering of
incident wave). At ﬁg. 1 the light pressure force acting on the electron layer is
presented for the motion in the given ﬁeld (ﬁg. 1a, α = 0) and with account of
the radiation losses (ﬁg. 1b, α = 0.1), where the parameter α = 2πσe/(mωc)
characterizes the electron density of the bunch. The amplitude of the external
wave is not large α0 = 2 besides the coulomb interaction of the electrons is
omitted. Fig. 1 demonstrates that the mean Lorents force is not equal to
zero: the deviation of the line to the up is larger than to the down. Besides
the increasing period of the force corresponds to the increasing longitudinal
velocity of the electron layer so that the eﬀective interaction time of the
layer with each half wave is also increasing. For the motion in the given ﬁeld
the frequency of Lorentz force and the mean velocity of electron layer are
constants.

Another peculiarity due to account of the radiation friction force is the
emergence of the bunching forces which compress the layer in the z direction
and support its initial geometry [16]. These forces slow down the electron
sheets with velocities larger than the mean velocity of the layer and accelerate
the delaying sheets (ﬁg. 2). At ﬁg. 2a the bunching eﬀect of the radiation
friction force is not taken into account and the coulomb forces tear the layer
during very short time. At ﬁg. 2b the coulomb forces and the bunching forces
are taken into account simultaneously so the layer is stable for considerably
longer time. The stability of the layer geometry depends on the value of
accelerating parameter α0, initial thickness of the layer and a value of electron
density inside the bunch. Such bunching forces can compensate partially the
coulomb spread of the layer along the z direction (increase of the bunch
thickness) and appear to be in a sense analogous to the magnetic attraction
forces between two parallel currents formed by the moving charges.

One has to account for an action of an ion background of the target
for proper simulation of the process of interaction between electromagnetic
wave and dense plasma layer in the 1D3V model [16]. Actually this model
is adequate in case when the distance between the electron and ion layers
is considerably smaller than the transverse dimensions of the layers. In our
simulations below the ion background is supposed to be motionless producing
only the Coulomb force acting on the electron layer.

The initial thickness of the target used in simulations is l = 10−2µ and

4

considerably smaller than the wavelength of the incident radiation which is
λ = 1µ. The targets with such thickness can be easily obtained experimen-
tally [20] besides the front of ultraintense laser pulse squeezes the electron
layer in the z direction making it thickness considerably smaller than initial
thickness of the target [16,21].

At ﬁg. 3 the results of computer simulations for the process of electron
layer acceleration are presented (the parameter α = 1 in the ﬁg. 3a and
α = 0.001 in the ﬁg. 3b). At the upper plots the dependence of transverse
momenta py for some electron sheets of the bunch on dimensionless laboratory
time ωt are presented and at the lower plots the longitudinal momenta pz
are shown. The acceleration parameter α0 = 100. So all electron sheets
of the layer can in principle move synchronously during acceleration by the
ﬁrst half cycle of electromagnetic wave constituting the relativistic electron
mirror. For other half cycles of the incident laser pulse the bunch can be
destroyed for large parameter α by the coulomb forces however for small α
values the bunch can be stable during several half cycles that in laboratory
frame can correspond to the time of several hundreds of femtosecond. So in
the process of interaction of ultraintense femtosecond laser pulse with thin
solid target the relativistic electron mirror can be formed allowing to realize
the up-conversion of light into X-ray and gamma-ray bands.

3 Up-conversion of counter propagating wave

Let now consider the simulation of the wave transformation for weak counter-
propagating wave with an amplitude E1 (α1 = eE1/(mωc)) and frequency ω0
(for simplicity we suppose that the frequencies of accelerating and counter-
propagating waves are equal). At ﬁg. 4a the frequency transformation factor
fv = (1 + βz)/(1 − βz) is presented. The plot of py in the presence of counter
propagating wave is shown at ﬁg. 4b. The parameter α1 = 1, the front of
this pulse have a delay with respect to accelerating pulse for the electrons
can achieve high energy and become ultra relativistic. The zoom of electron
oscillations at the top of ﬁg. 4b is presented at ﬁg. 4c.
It is worth to
mention that all electron sheets move practically along one trajectory so the
dependencies of py on time for diﬀerent sheets are coincide.

At ﬁg. 5a the reﬂected radiation of the counter-propagating wave is pre-
sented for α = 0.1, α0 = 100 and α1 = 1. Due to the time dependence of
transformation factor fv the frequency of reﬂected wave have to be altering

5

being small at the beginning of the acceleration process then largest at the
top of the ﬁrst half wave and small again at the end of the ﬁrst half wave.

At ﬁg. 5b the zoom of the reﬂected ﬁeld is shown (sample 2). The devi-
ation of the radiation ﬁeld from sinusoidal form results from high harmonics
generating during the reﬂection of the counter-propagating wave from rela-
tivistic electron bunch and partially from the simulation numerical errors.

At ﬁg. 5c the spectra of the samples of equal length at the slope (1)
and at the top (2) of the ﬁrst half wave of accelerating pulse are presented
(the amplitude and the frequency of the reﬂected wave are normalized to the
amplitude and the frequency of the incident accelerating wave). The carrying
frequencies in two cases are diﬀerent due to the diﬀerent transformation factor
fv (cf. ﬁg. 4a), besides the spectral bandwidth for sample 1 is larger than
for sample 2 because of the faster change of frequency at the slope.

The amplitude of the reﬂected wave depends on the values of parameters α
and α0. For smaller value of parameter α the amplitude of the reﬂected wave
is smaller because of the lower electron density in the bunch and correspond-
ingly low value of reﬂection coeﬃcient. On the other hand the frequency
transformation coeﬃcient is larger for small α value the parameter α0 being
constant because of smaller radiation friction (cf. ﬁg. 3).

For α0 = 30 that can be realized in modern experiments the maximum
frequency transformation factor fv can be about 4α2
0 ≈ 2000 so the reﬂection
of incident wave with wavelength λ = 200nm can give the coherent radiation
from the X-ray band. For petawatt lasers the acceleration parameter α0 can
be about 100 ÷ 200 so the reﬂected coherent radiation can be already in the
γ-ray band.

Abstract. During major magnetic storms enhanced ﬂuxes of relativistic electrons

in the inner magnetosphere have been observed to correlate with ULF waves. The

enhancements can take place over a period of several hours. In order to account for such

a rapid generation of relativistic electrons, we examine the mechanism of transit-time

acceleration of electrons by low-frequency fast-mode MHD waves, here the assumed

form of ULF waves. Transit-time damping refers to the resonant interaction of electrons

with the compressive magnetic ﬁeld component of the fast-mode waves via the zero

cyclotron harmonic. In terms of quasi-linear theory, a kinetic equation for the electron

distribution function is formulated incorporating a momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient

representing transit-time resonant interaction between electrons and a continuous broad

band spectrum of oblique fast-mode waves. Pitch angle scattering is assumed to be

suﬃciently rapid to maintain an isotropic electron distribution function. It is further

assumed that there is a substorm-produced population of electrons with energies of

the order of 100 keV. Calculations of the acceleration timescales in the model show

that fast-mode waves in the Pc4 to Pc5 frequency range, with typically observed wave

amplitudes (∆B = 10–20 nT), can accelerate the seed electrons to energies of order

MeV in a period of a few hours. It is therefore concluded that the mechanism examined

in this paper, namely, transit-time acceleration of electrons by fast-mode MHD waves,

may account for the rapid enhancements in relativistic electron ﬂuxes in the inner

magnetosphere that are associated with major storms.

1. Introduction

There is much current interest in the rapid enhancements of relativistic (>MeV)

electrons in the Earth’s inner magnetosphere (3 ≤ L ≤ 6) taking place over tens of

minutes or a few hours during major magnetic storms [e.g., Baker et al., 1998a; Rostoker

et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1999; Hudson et al., 1999,2000]. Part of this interest is due to the

fact that relativistic electrons appearing near geostationary orbit (L = 6.6) constitute

a potential hazard to operational spacecraft [e.g., Baker et al., 1997]. These relativistic

electrons are sometimes colloquially referred to as “killer electrons.” Rapid energetic

electron enhancements have been observed to correlate closely with ULF waves in

the Pc4 (7–22 mHz) or Pc5 (2–7 mHz) frequency ranges. It is therefore reasonable

to examine the possible role that ULF waves may have in generating the relativistic

electron ﬂux enhancements. Liu et al. [1999] have formulated an acceleration mechanism

comprising magnetic pumping by ULF waves, while Hudson et al. [1999,2000] have

proposed a drift-resonant acceleration mechanism involving enhanced ULF waves,

modeled by a three dimensional global MHD simulation of the January 10-11, 1997,

conoral-mass-ejection-driven magnetic cloud event. Notwithstanding these studies, the

acceleration mechanism of relativistic electrons in the inner magnetosphere is not yet

fully understood. It is the purpose of the present paper to examine the role of ULF

waves in accelerating electrons in the magnetosphere from a new standpoint. Here

we examine the “transit-time acceleration” of electrons by low-frequency, oblique,

fast-mode (magnetosonic) MHD waves. Transit-time acceleration in association with

4

“transit-time damping” has been studied, for instance, by Stix [1962], Fisk [1976], and

Achterberg [1981]. The basic physical mechanism of transit-time damping, which is a

resonant form of Fermi acceleration and can be regarded as the magnetic analogue of

Landau damping, is discussed in detail by Miller [1997]; the name transit-time damping

arises because the gyroresonance condition deﬁning the process can be expressed as

λk/vk ≈ T , where vk is the parallel component of particle velocity, λk is the parallel

wavelength, and T is the wave period. Thus the wave-particle interaction is strongest

when the particle transit-time across the wave compression is approximately equal to

the period. It is the compressive magnetic ﬁeld component of the fast-mode wave that

allows for the eﬀect of transit-time damping [Fisk, 1976; Achterberg, 1981; Miller et al.,

1996]. While transit-time damping has been utilized as a mechanism for accelerating

energetic particles in the interplanetary medium [Fisk, 1976], for accelerating electrons

in solar ﬂares [Miller et al., 1996; Miller, 1997], and for accelerating cosmic ray particles

[Schlickeiser and Miller, 1998], it has not been examined as a possible acceleration

mechanism of electrons in the magnetosphere. It will be shown in this paper, in fact,

that transit-time damping of fast-mode MHD waves (here the assumed form of ULF

waves) is a viable mechanism for generating the aforementioned rapid enhancements of

relativistic electrons in the inner magnetosphere. It will be assumed that electrons of

energies ∼100 keV that are injected near geosynchronous orbit as a result of substorm

activity [e.g., Baker et al., 1989, 1998b] form the source population for the relativistic

(>MeV) electrons that are subsequently observed.

The structure of ULF waves in the Earth’s magnetosphere is complex. Broadly,

5

MHD waves in the dipole magnetosphere are characterized by “toroidal” and “poloidal”

modes, and, in general, these modes are coupled. Toroidal modes relate to transverse

ULF waves propagating along ﬁeld lines, while poloidal modes relate to global

compressional waves associated with radial oscillations of the ﬁeld lines. Field line

resonance (FLR) theory describes the toroidal pulsations as transverse Alfv´en waves

standing on dipole ﬂux tubes with ﬁxed ends in the ionosphere. Extensive theory

has accumulated pertaining to ﬁeld line resonances, global compressional modes,

and associated wave excitation mechanisms [e.g., see Kivelson and Southwood, 1986,

Krauss-Varban and Patel, 1988, Lee and Lysak, 1989, and references therein]. Anderson

et al. [1990] give a historical review of observations of ULF waves in the magnetosphere

and also present results of a statistical study of Pc3–5 pulsations during the period

from August 24, 1984, to December 7, 1985. It should be emphasized here that unlike

ULF waves observed during relatively quiet magnetic conditions, storm-associated ULF

waves characteristically have large compressional components. It is these components

that engender the transit-time acceleration mechanism presented in this paper.

With respect to the typical motion of energetic electrons in the inner magnetosphere,

these electrons gyrate around their magnetic ﬁeld line and bounce back and forth along

their ﬁeld line between mirror points, while executing an eastward drift about the

Earth. Consequently, since in the interests of rendering the theory presented herein

tractable we shall assume a constant background magnetic ﬁeld, our formulation applies

to compressional MHD waves interacting with electrons that mirror relatively close to

the equator.

6

We are concerned with the fast-mode MHD branch in plasma wave theory [e.g.,

Swanson, 1989] and, in particular, with fast-mode waves on the ω ≪ Ωi section of the

branch, where Ωi is the proton gyrofrequency. Such waves have the dispersion relation,

ω = kvA,

(1)

where ω, k, and vA are the wave frequency, the wave number, and the Alfv´en speed,

respectively. In general, the condition for gyroresonant interaction between electrons

and a wave of frequency ω is

ω − kkvk = n|Ωe|/γ,

(2)

where vk is the electron parallel velocity component , kk = k cos θ is the parallel

wave number, θ is the wave propagation angle, |Ωe| is the electron gyrofrequency, γ

is the Lorentz factor, and n (= 0, ±1, ±2, · · ·) denotes the cyclotron harmonic. The

compressive component of the wave magnetic ﬁeld can interact with electrons through

the n = 0 resonance [e.g., Miller et al., 1996], in which case (2) reduces to

ω = kkvk.

(3)

Equation (3) is the gyroresonance condition that deﬁnes transit-time damping [Stix,

1962; Fisk, 1976; Achterberg, 1981]. From (1) and (3) it follows that

vk = vA/ cos θ,

from which follows the important necessary threshold condition for resonance,

v > vA,

(4)

(5)

7

where v is the particle speed. Condition (5) states that for electrons with any pitch-

angle interacting with fast-mode MHD waves propagating at any angle θ, resonance

is only possible for electrons with speeds exceeding the Alfv´en speed. The equivalent

minimum-energy condition can be conveniently written,

E > Emin ,

Emin = (1 − β 2

A)−1/2 − 1 ≈ β 2

A/2 ,

(6)

where E is the electron kinetic energy in units of rest-mass energy and βA is the Alfv´en

speed in units of the speed of light. Values for the parameter βA and the minimum

energy Emin that are representative of the inner magnetosphere are given in Table 1. In Table 1

Table 1, we set N0 = 10 cm−3 as the particle number density in the inner magnetosphere

outside the plasmasphere, and we use the equatorial (dipole) magnetic ﬁeld value

B0 = 3.12 × 10−5/L3 T. With regard to the background electron population, in order

for the fast-mode waves to accelerate a small fraction of the electrons in the tail of the

distribution rather than to produce a bulk heating of the population, it is required that

vA > vth, where vth is a characteristic thermal speed. Taking the background electron

temperature in the magnetosphere to be Tee<1 eV, we ﬁnd from Table 1 that the required

condition vA > vth is satisﬁed. In addition, since we are assuming a substorm-produced

source of electrons with energies ∼100 keV, Table 1 shows that the minimum-energy

condition (6) is well satisﬁed; that is, the condition v ≫ vA holds.

The analysis of transit-time damping of fast-mode waves that is carried out in this

paper and presented in the following section is based on quasi-linear theory; this is

8

an approximation that requires justiﬁcation. In numerical simulations, Miller [1997]

has found that quasi-linear theory provides an accurate description of transit-time

acceleration even when the energy density of the fast-mode wave turbulence is

almost equal to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld energy density ((∆B/B0)2e<1). Thus,

although the analysis presented here is based formally on “small-amplitude” turbulence

((∆B/B0)2 ≪ 1), the results are applicable to the large-amplitude ULF waves typically

observed during magnetic storms.

2. Electron Momentum Diﬀusion Equation

Consider energetic charged particles in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld with superimposed

small-amplitude plasma turbulence. By using the quasi-linear approximation [Kennel

and Engelmann, 1966; Lerche, 1968], the pitch angle averaged particle distribution

function F (p, t) can be shown to satisfy the kinetic (Fokker-Planck) equation

p2

where

D(p) =

Dppdµ.

(7)

(8)

In (7) and (8), p is the relativistic momentum of the particle in units of rest-mass

momentum given by p = γv/c, where v is the particle speed and γ = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2 =

(1 + p2)1/2 is the Lorentz factor, with c being the speed of light; t is time; µ is the cosine

of the pitch angle; and Dpp is the momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which depends on the

properties of the wave turbulence. In the derivation of (7), it has been assumed that

9

the rate of pitch angle scattering is large enough to isotropize the distribution function,

and the pitch angle has been eliminated from the equation by averaging with respect to

µ. The distribution function F is normalized so that 4πp2F (p, t)dp is the number of the

particles per unit volume in the momentum interval dp. It has also been assumed in

deriving (7) that there are no energy losses, that no particles escape from the system,

and that there are no additional particle sources or sinks.

Associated with the (averaged) momentum diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(p) in (7) and (8)

is the acceleration timescale,

TA = p2/D(p).

(9)

In this paper we consider two forms for the transit-time damping diﬀusion coeﬃcient,

given by Miller et al. [1996] and Schlickeiser and Miller [1998], respectively. Assuming

a continuous spectrum of oblique, low-frequency (ω ≪ Ωi), fast-mode waves and

assuming isotropic turbulence and integrating over wave propagation angle, Miller et al.

[1996] obtain a diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dpp for transit-time damping of fast-mode waves by

electrons that can be expressed in the form

Dpp =

where Ωi = eB0/(mic) is the proton gyrofrequency, with B0 being the ambient

magnetic ﬁeld strength, mi being the proton rest mass, and e being the electronic

charge; R = (∆B/B0)2 is the ratio of the turbulent wave energy to magnetic ﬁeld

energy, with ∆B being the average fast-mode wave amplitude; chki/Ωi is the mean

dimensionless wave number of the wave spectrum; β = v/c; and βA = vA/c where

vA = B0/(4πN0mi)1/2 is the Alfv´en speed, with N0 being the particle number density.

Substituting (10) into (8) and setting

yields the result

for x < 1. The function g(x) can be regarded as an eﬃciency factor [Miller et al.,

1996], which relates to the velocity-dependent fraction of electrons that can resonate

with fast-mode waves having the assumed spectrum; g(x) = 0 for x ≥ 1, and in the

limit as β → 1, g(x) → loge(1/βA) − 5/4, approximately, since βA ≪ 1. Therefore, for

values of βA appropriate to the Earth’s magnetosphere (see Table 1) for 3 ≤ L ≤ 6.6,

with N0 = 10 cm−3, the function g(x) approaches values in the range from 2.4 to 4.7 for

highly relativistic electrons.

Setting hki = hωi/vA in (12), where hωi is the mean angular frequency (rad/s),

from (9) and (12) we ﬁnd that the acceleration timescale TA can be written as

TA =

(14)

where hfwi = hωi/2π is the mean wave frequency (in millihertz). Later in this section

and in the numerical results presented below, we shall ﬁnd it convenient to use the

previously introduced dimensionless kinetic energy E = Ek/(mec2) = γ − 1, where Ek

11

is the electron kinetic energy and me is the electron rest mass; we shall require the

relation,

β = [E(E + 2)]1/2 /(E + 1).

(15)

Schlickeiser and Miller [1998] assume that the fast-mode wave turbulence is

isotropic and Kolmogorov-like, with a power law spectral energy density distribution in

wave number k. Speciﬁcally, the spectral energy density W is assumed to take the form

W (k) ∝ k−q, k > kmin,

(16)

where q(> 1) is the spectral index and kmin is some minimum wave number.

Corresponding to the Kolmogorov-like spectrum (16), the momentum diﬀusion

coeﬃcient Dpp, as given by Schlickeiser and Miller [1998], can be written

Dpp =

In (20) we set the minimum dimensionless wave number kmin = 2πfmin/vA, where

It should be noted that while the transit-time damping diﬀusion coeﬃcients (12)

and (20) may appear diﬀerent, they are, in fact, approximately equivalent. Since the

coeﬃcient (12) employs an average wave frequency, while coeﬃcient (20) employs a

minimum frequency and a Kolmogorov spectral index, it is convenient to utilize both

coeﬃcients in order to retain some ﬂexibility in constructing the acceleration timescale

proﬁles and comparing the results with observations.

Finally, it is useful to relate the mean energy change of a particle h ˙Ei to the

acceleration timescale TA. Associated with the momentum diﬀusion process given by

(7) – (8), the mean energy change [Tsytovich, 1977; Achterberg, 1981] is given by

h ˙Ei =

and, hence, by (9) we derive the result,

h ˙Ei ≈

(E + 1)TA

,

(24)

(25)

where σ is a factor such that σ = 4 corresponding to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient (12), and

σ = 2 + q corresponding to (20). The approximation in the second line of (24) follows

from the fact that, for the electron energies considered in this paper, the functions g

and I vary only slightly with x.

3. Numerical results

The acceleration timescale TA depends on a number of parameters. Both results

(14) and (23) depend on the average wave amplitude ∆B, the electron kinetic energy

E, the background plasma number density N0, and the location L. In addition, (14)

depends on the mean wave frequency hfwi, while (23) depends on the the minimum

wave frequency fmin and the turbulence spectral index q. With regard to typical wave

amplitudes of Pc-5 pulsations during major magnetic storms, Barﬁeld and McPherron

[1978] and Engebretson and Cahill [1981] report ∆B ≈ 10 nT, while Higuchi et al. [1986]

report typical values ∆B ≈ 70 – 90 nT corresponding to the maximum power spectral

14

densities in the frequency range 5 – 12 mHz. Baker et al. [1998a] report ULF waves in

the frequency range 2 –20 mHz having amplitudes ∆B ≈ 50 nT, rising to ∆B ≈ 200 nT

at times.

We assume a substorm-produced seed electron population with energies in the

range 100 – 300 keV, which corresponds to the dimensionless kinetic energy E in

the approximate range 0.2 < E < 0.6. From result (25), it follows that electrons

with energies in such a range accelerate to energies in the range from 1 MeV to 2

MeV, approximately, over the timescale TA(E) where 0.2 < E < 0.6. In Figure 1,

N0 = 10 cm−3, and for the speciﬁed mean wave frequency hfwi = 10 mHz, curves are

plotted showing TA, given by (14), as a function of energy E (eV), at the locations

L = 3, 4, 5, 6.6, for each of the wave amplitudes ∆B = 10, 20, 50 nT; for reference, a

(dashed) line is shown corresponding to a time of one day. In general, for a ﬁxed energy

E, the timescale TA is seen to increase as the value of L decreases, and, as expected,

TA decreases as the wave amplitude ∆B increases. Figure 1 indicates, in particular,

that at L = 6.6, for the parameter values N0 = 10 cm−3 and hfW i = 10 mHz, the

timescales for accelerating seed electrons of energies ∼ 100 keV to energies ∼ 1 MeV

are approximately 6 days, 1.5 days, and 5.8 hours corresponding to the respective

wave amplitudes ∆B = 10, 20, 50 nT. The aforementioned respective times assume the

approximate values 2 days, 12 hours, and 2 hours if the value of N0 = 1 cm−3 is speciﬁed

for the background plasma number density (N.B. It could be argued that N0 = 10 cm−3

is too high a generic value for the background plasma number density, and that N0 = 1

cm−3 is a more representative value).

15

In Figure 2, we show the variation of TA, as given by (14), as a function of the

wave amplitude ∆B (nT), for a ﬁxed value of particle energy, E = 1/4 (or β = 0.6).

The upper, middle, and lower panels of Figure 2 correspond respectively to the mean

wave frequencies hfwi = 2, 10, and 22 mHz. The decrease in acceleration timescale

with increase in mean frequency hfwi, as indicated by formula (14), is clearly shown

in Figure 2. Figure 2 can be used as an illustration of the wave amplitudes ∆B,

at a given location L, and for a given mean wave frequency hfwi, that correspond to

a particular timescale TA for the generation of electrons of energies ∼> 1 MeV from

seed electrons of energies ∼> 100 keV. In Table 1 , corresponding to (14), the required

wave amplitudes ∆B are given that correspond to a timescale T0 = 10 hours for this

generation process, corresponding to the mean wave frequencies hfwi = 2, 10, and 22

mHz at the speciﬁed locations, and with N0 = 10 cm−3. In particular, we note that at

L = 6.6, corresponding to the respective mean wave frequencies hfwi = 10, 22 mHz, the

required wave amplitudes are ∆B = 39, 26 nT; corresponding to N0 = 1 cm−3, these

respective wave amplitudes are ∆B = 22, 15 nT.

In Figure 3, for N0 = 10 cm−3, the acceleration timescale TA (sec) given by

(23) is plotted as a function of particle energy E, for the minimum wave frequencies

fmin = 2, 10 mHz, for the spectral indices q = 3/2, 5/3, 5/2, 4, at each of the locations

L = 3, 6.6, and for the mean wave amplitude ∆B = 20 nT. As can be observed from

Figure 3, the timescale TA decreases as both fmin and L increase; lower values of

TA are also generally favoured by lower q-values. The curves in Figure 3 show that,

corresponding to ∆B = 20 nT, the timescale TA at L = 6.6 is of the order of a few hours,

16

for values of q in the range 3/2 < q < 5/3. In Table 2 , values of the wave amplitudes

∆B (nT) are given that correspond to the value of the acceleration timescale TA given

by (23) equal to 10 hours, for the speciﬁed values of fmin, q, and L, with E = 1/4 (or

β = 0.6), and N0 = 10 cm−3. Thus, Table 2 , which corresponds to (23), eﬀectively

gives the required wave amplitudes ∆B to generate relativistic (∼> 1 MeV) electrons

from seed (∼> 100 keV) electrons in a timescale of 10 hours, for the speciﬁed values of

the remaining parameters. For instance, at L = 6.6, for a minimum wave frequency

fmin = 10 mHz, and with q in the range 3/2 < q < 5/3, the required wave amplitudes

are in the range 5.4 nT < ∆B < 7.1 nT.

4. Discussion

The present paper is a new examination of ULF waves as a possible rapid

acceleration mechanism of electrons in the inner magnetosphere during storms.

Speciﬁcally, we take the assumed form of ULF waves to be fast-mode (magnetosonic)

MHD waves, and analyze the mechanism of transit-time acceleration of electrons

under magnetic storm conditions. We assume that the seed electrons in the process

have energies in the range 100 – 300 keV, and are produced by substorm activity. In

accordance with quasi-linear theory and a test particle approach, a simple model kinetic

equation (7) is formulated in which momentum diﬀusion is due to the gyroresonant

transit-time interaction between electrons and fast-mode MHD turbulence. A continuous

broad-band spectrum of oblique fast-mode waves is assumed, and it is further supposed

that pitch-angle scattering is suﬃciently rapid to maintain an isotropic particle

17

distribution function. The model calculations applied to the inner magnetosphere show

that the mechanism under consideration, namely transit-time damping of fast-mode

MHD waves, can accelerate source electrons with energies 100 – 300 keV to relativistic

electrons with energies exceeding 1 MeV, in a timescale of a few hours if the wave

amplitudes are of the order of ∆B = 10 – 20 nT. Since observed amplitudes of ULF

waves during storm-time are in this range, it is concluded that transit-time damping of

fast-mode MHD waves, as the agent of ULF wave activity, could play an important role

in generating the observed increases of relativistic electrons during major storms.

We note that the models formulated by Liu et al. [1999] and Hudson et al. [1999a,

b] also show that ULF waves could be instrumental in energizing relativistic electrons

under storm conditions, though their approaches are quite diﬀerent from that adopted

here. Liu et al.

[1999] formulate an acceleration mechanism comprising magnetic

pumping with global ULF waves as the energy source and pitch-angle scattering as

the catalyst, while Hudson et al. [1999a, b] propose a mechanism, further investigated

by Elkington et al. [1999], in which electrons are adiabatically accelerated through a

drift-resonance via interaction with toroidal-mode ULF waves.

We caution that the calculations in the present paper are based on an approximate,

timescale analysis. A more complete investigation of electron acceleration by transit-time

damping of fast-mode waves entails the full solution of a kinetic equation of the form

(7), appropriately modiﬁed by the inclusion of terms representing particle and energy

losses under storm conditions.

Aside from the aforementioned ULF wave mechanisms, other energization

18

mechanisms have been previously proposed to account for relativistic electron

enhancements during storms, e.g., see Li et al. [1997] and Summers and Ma [1999] for

brief summaries. Moreover, various types of storm-related energetic electron events

have been observed [e.g., Baker et al., 1997; 1998b; Reeves, 1998; Reeves et al., 1998].

The rapid acceleration mechanism presented in this paper appears well suited to major

storms that produce coherent global oscillations in the magnetosphere in the Pc-4 to

Pc-5 frequency range. In contrast, the gradual acceleration process occurring over a few

days involving gyroresonant electron-whistler-mode chorus interaction [ Summers et al.,

1998, 1999; Summers and Ma, 1999; see also Ma and Summers, 1998] is expected to

apply to moderate storms having long-lasting recovery phases.

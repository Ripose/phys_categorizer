Petvishvili equation. We examine the stability of this solution and
compare the late stages of the ﬂow with the ensemble of vortices.

1 Introduction

The aim of these notes is to contribute to the clariﬁcation of the dynamical
processes leading to the formation, conﬁnement charactersitics and intermit-
tent behavior of Internal Transport Barriers (ITB). We focus here on the
role of the stationary periodic structure of the ﬂow appearing in the inter-
mediate spatial range between the highly radially elongated eddies of the Ion
Temperature Gradient (ITG) instability and the Larmor - radius scale vor-
tices described by the Hasegawa-Mima equation. In this “mesoscopic” range

2

the structures are described by the ion dynamics equation where the scalar
nonlinearity (in contrast to the polarisation drift nonlinearity) is dominating.
The current physical understanding of the formation of the transport
barriers is based on the eﬀect of the sheared poloidal plasma rotation on
the ITG potential structures. The ITG potential structures are in general of
large radial extension. They may persist even in the turbulent regime and
are a major agent of transport since the plasma convection inside the eddies
is an eﬃcient support for temperature advection between high (small r) and
low (high r) temperature regions. It is well known that this geometry of the
ﬂow generates velocity stress and that the divergence of this tensor induces a
substantial contribution in the momentum balance equation for ions. When
this momentum drive is suﬃciently high, the plasma begins to rotate, and
a space distribution of the poloidal velocity is established. The shear of the
poloidal velocity has a strong eﬀect on the turbulent structures with com-
parable space extension and the radial correlation length is reduced. This
correspondingly reduces the transport leading to the formation of a transport
barrier. A theory that explains this in quantitative terms has been proposed
by Diamond and coworkers, as a “predator-pray” model, in general formal-
ized with Fischer-type equations. It consists of the description, in terms of
the density of the energy quanta, of the balance in phase space of two distinct
populations, associated with the turbulent waves and respectively with the
zonal ﬂows. The model naturally leads to the self-organised state consisting
of mutual control of these two physical entities, found in a permanent rela-
tive adjustement. This model is essentially a thermodynamical model, which
probably remains true for a wide variety of dynamical details.

A picture of the dynamics is allways useful, even if the scaling laws (of
threshold and transport rate) are in general based on thermodynamical bal-
ance and conservation properties. The later is a more general (and safer)
level of description, leading to a picture where the invariance properties of
the dynamical equations govern the scaling. The dynamical evolution of the
system is a detailed description and its validity is strongly dependent on
a clear separation of space-time scales and a correct choice of initial and
boundary conditions. However, the physical content can only revealed by
the detailed description.

In this work we develop a possible phenomenological model of generation
of the Internal Transport Barriers in tokamak. This model relies on the role
of the stationary periodic exact solution of the Flierl-Petviashvili equation as
an attracting state for the ion turbulence, when the regularity of the eddies is
still pronounced. We also analyse analytically and numerically the stability
of this solution. Some properties are shown to be connected with the fact
that this equation is closely related with other, exactly integrable models.

2 Possible phenomenology of the ITB forma-

tion

Numerical simulations show that the structure of the potential perturbation
in the ion temperature gradient (ITG) instability are elongated and rather
thin on the direction that is transversal to their longest dimension. The
Reynolds stress arising from the broken symmetry conﬁguration induces the
rotation of the plasma. It may be useful here to recall the similar situation
arising in the thermal convection associated with the Rayleigh-Benard (RB)
instability. Experiments carried out by Howard and Krishnamurti in typical
RB geometry at increasing Rayleigh number have revealed that the classical
conduction-convection bifurcation is only the ﬁrst of a series of transitions
generating new system ’s behaviors. The RB geometry of convective rolls is
sensitive to perturbations and this leads to a symmetry breaking consisting
of deformations of the rolls in direction parallel with the two plates, in one
direction for the low (high temperature) plate and opposite direction for
the upper (low temperature) plate. This is accompanied by a nonvanishing
statistical average of the velocity stress tensor, whose nonzero divergence
(Reynolds stress) is equivalent to a momentum drive. The lower part of
the convective ﬂuid is entrained in a ﬂow in one direction (parallel to the
plates) while the upper part of the convective ﬁeld aquires a ﬂow motion
in the opposite direction. These ﬂows are called “winds” and they are seen,
together with the strong deformation of the rolls, on the experimental picture
of the ﬂuid section. In addition, intermittent processes consisting of rising of
ﬁnite volumes of cold ﬂuid (from the bottom region) toward the top plate and
fall of warm ﬂuid from the top region into the cold region have been observed.
These events are called “plumes”. One may consider from this picture only
the part relating to the eﬀect of the Reynolds stress as particularly relevant
for the plasma convection in the eddies of the ITG instability.

The result of the strong Reynolds stress arising in the ITG instability is
the deformation (“tilting”) of the convection eddies and the generation of
the corresponding winds. The convective structures are strongly elongated
and tend to align with the poloidal direction, as imposed by the momentum
from the Reynolds stress. At a certain moment the deformed ITG pattern
of ﬂow evolves to the solution consisting simply of parallel layers of ﬂow, a
structure which is essentially poloidally oriented and periodic along the radial
direction. We have proved that this is an exact and robust solution of the ion
dynamics on mesoscopic space scales, (approx. ρs/ε) where it is dominated
by the scalar nonlinearity. Attaining this state, the plasma has practically
vanishing transport in the radial direction. We have to note that it is not

4

necessary to invoke the tearing appart of the ITG eddies and the destruction
of the radial correlation via sheared ﬂow. The solution intrinsically has a
radial scale and no transport because there is no phase mismatch between
particles and potential.

The ﬂow represented by this solution may last indeﬁnitely except for the
collisional decay which however may be considered low in high temperature
regimes. Furthermore, in the ideal stationary case, the Reynolds stress van-
ishes due to the poloidal symmetry. However there is a limitation of the
persistance of this periodically layered ﬂow and this arises from the stabil-
ity against perturbations. We can suppose that this may take place in two
diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst of them is essentially a reversed process as that
which led to the periodic layers, and consists of closing the ﬂow lines at ﬁnite
poloidal wavelength, with suppression of the zonal ﬂow and reformation of
the tilted ITG pattern. The ﬁnite radial projection leads to a sudden increase
of transport. The other way is a strong qualitative change of the ﬂow.

We have found that the stability of the periodic ﬂow pattern is deter-
mined both by the amplitude and by the geometry of the initial perturbation.
Some perturbations (like, for example, the monopolar vortices embedded in-
side a layer) have a very long stability time since they accomodate with the
background ﬂow by reshaping the distribution of local velocities. However,
perturbations that have a high amplitude relative to the background ﬂow
and/or do not conform to the ﬂow geometry lead to the destabilisation and
eventually destruction of the ﬂow pattern. It is important however to note
that the numerical simulations (presently with limitted precision) and ana-
lytical considerations suggest that the destruction of the ﬂow pattern does
not immediately lead to an arbitrary random ﬁeld: a fundamental process is
ρs) space scale vortices. We can show that the
the generation of small (
regular ﬂow structure is replaced by a lattice of vortices which is reminescent
of the exact solution of a closely related nonlinear equation. This solution
evolves, due to the weak interaction between the vortices, to an ensemble of
quasi-independent vortices that collide inelastically and become of various
amplitudes plus a surrounding drift wave radiation. From this random ﬁeld
the ITG instability may regenerate the structure of eddies and reinstate the
transport. The time scale for doing this is γIT G, followed by saturation, as
shown by many simulations.

∼

The successive steps of this qualitative scenario can repeate themselves
over and over but the senstivity to perturbation of the time scales involved
may lead to an intermittent (bursty) behavior rather than to a limit cicle.
From purely theoretical point of view it is hard to expect that this evolution
can be lumped into a single equation whose phase space could provide the
successive transitions.

5

We note that the transport is low in the phase where the ﬂow is described
by the stationary periodic solution of the Flierl-Petviashvili equation and in
the state where the ensemble of vortices has replaced it (since the elementary
space scale is very small, of the order of few Larmor radius, as we will show
below. The large eddies have a substantial transport.

Introducing this velocity into the continuity equation, one obtains an equa-
tion for the electrostatic potential φ.

In the Appendix it is presented a derivation of three versions of the
nonlinear diﬀerential equations that may govern, in certain conditions, the
two-dimensional ion dynamics at intermediate scales.

3.2 The stationary equation at intermediate space scales

(Flierl-Petviashvili equation)

The ion drift wave equation has a distinct dynamical behavior according
to the space-time scales involved. The Hasegawa-Mima-Charney (HMC)
equation is obtained for small scales and the stationary states exhibit dipolar
structures of the order of the Larmor radius. On larger scales (intermediate
between the HMC dipole and the large ITG eddies) the scalar (or KdV-type)
nonlinearity is prevailing and the only known structures are monopolar [4].
Both are not solitonic but very robust and long lived. In the latter case a one-
dimensional version of the equation has been derived by Petviashvili [5] who
also used it in the study of the Jupiter’s Red Spot. The equation has been
rederived along with a careful analysis of the scales involved [6], [8], resolving
a controversy on the role of the temperature gradient [9], [7]. In the study of
ocean ﬂows, Flierl [10] has independently formulated an equation with the
same structure. The one dimensional equation has been solved on an inﬁnite
domain [11], [9], obtaining as solution the KdV soliton. The two dimensional
equation has vortical monopolar solutions, well studied numerically [16], [17].
Other applications include long waves on thin liquid ﬁlms and Rossby waves
in rotating atmosphere.

This is only an approximate solution and the reason to look for such form
resides in the previous indication that the one dimensional version of this
equation, with generalized nonlinearity, presents exact solutions as powers of
the sech function.

3.3 The monopolar vortex and the similarity with in-

tegrable equations

It is well known that the Flierl-Petviashvili equation has long been stud-
ied in relation with the possibility that it has as solution an isolated vortex
with nontrivial stability properties. This vortex has never been determined
analytically and the explanation seems to be that the equation is not inte-
grable. However, analytical approximations exists Eq.(2) and also a very well
documented study of numerically-calculated vortex solution is available [17],
[16].

The monopolar vortex has been considered in relation with the Great Red
Spot, a vortical structure with a long time life (more than three hundread
years), which is observed to be embedded in the zonal ﬂow of the atmosphere
of Jupiter. The condition imposed to the Flierl-Petviashvili equation is to
provide an isolated, ﬁnitely extended vortical solution, obeying boundary
conditions at inﬁnity (on the 2D) of smooth decaying.

We consider that the insuccess in determining the analytical vortex solu-

tion has a fundamental motivation.

First of all the equation does not pass the Painlev´e test, so it is very
likely that it is not integrable. This, in the deﬁnition that is suggested by
the Inverse Scattering Transform method, means that there is no Lax pair of
operators for this equation. In other words, one cannot ﬁnd a system of two
linear diﬀerential equations, whose condition of compatibility to be expressed
as the nonlinear FP equation.

This equation has close ressemblance with some approximative form of

other nonlinear equations. For example, consider the equation

∆φ = exp (

φ)

−

In particular
This is the Liouville equation, with numerous applications.
it has been invoked in the description of the distribution of current in the
magnetic conﬁnement systems (tokamak). This equation is integrable and
exact solutions are known.
In addition, exact analytical solutions can be
constructed on periodic domains. The expansion of the right hand side of
this equation takes a form close to the FP equation.

Even more close is the diﬀerential equation

−

sometimes known as Abelian-Higgs equation (AH), governing the vortices of
the superconducting media. This equation has also been derived by Jacobs-
Rebbi. It is clear that an expansion of the right hand side leads to something
close to the FP equation, especially because the FP equation has actually
been derived under the neglect of the third order powers of φ.

Or, this equation is exactly integrable on periodic domains. We have proved
[18] that it possesses a Lax pair of operators and we have constructed exact,
analytical solutions, expressed as ratios of Riemann Θ functions.

The solutions of the AH equation, as shown in the Fig.1 have the conﬁg-
uration of a lattice of vortices. This solution can be regarded in two diﬀerent

ways: as a function with a periodic set of maxima and minima; or, in a more
physical way, as an ensemble of vortices in plane that interact weakly. Then
one can easily assume that under the inﬂuence of perturbations, the precise
periodic geometry can be lost and the vortices begin to move rather freely in
plane and the interactions take the form of inelastic collisions.

The transformation of ridges having as section the sechyperbolic function,
into an array of vortices has been known previously and is well documented
numerically [17], [16]. We claim that the actual reason for this evolution, in
the numerical simulation of the FP equation, is not the attracting nature of
the monopolar vortex (which actually it is not even an exact solution) but
the fact that the initial function evolves to the nearest soliton-like solution of
the closely related equation, the AH equation. Or, this solution is a lattice
of monopolar vortices.

We can also explain why the monopolar vortex of the FP equation, ob-
tained only numerically and studied under a certain numerical imprecision,
has an amazing stability: it actually represents one only exemplar of vortex
from the lattice, isolated and extended to 2D inﬁnity by simply ignoring its
appartenence to the full, periodic solution. This is only numerically accept-
able, as an approximation, if the distance between neighboring vortices is
large enough.

We note, in addition, that the FP equation has also ressemblance with

the nonlinear diﬀerential equation

(∆ + λ) φ = sinh φ

which describes the stationary states of the Hasegawa-Mima equation. This
equation, again, is exactly integrable on periodic domains, and its solution
can be analytically expressed as ratios of Riemann Θ function. A comparison
between diﬀerent functions and the exact solution, represented by ℘ is shown
in Fig.2.

4 Coherent structures and drift wave radia-

tion

In previous studies [24], [25] we have developed a theoretical approach to
describe a coherent structure (the monopolar vortex of the FP equation)
immersed in a turbulent environment [40], [42], [43]. The theoretical in-
struments are inspired by the quantum theory of ﬁelds, in particular the
calculation of ﬁeld correlations from the eﬀective action [50], [47]. We have
deﬁned the action functional according to the Martin-Siggia-Rose description

of the perturbed ﬂow, where the potential consists of both coherent vortices
and drift wave radiation.

5 The analytical solution of the FP eq.

In a previous work [23] we have determined an exact solution of the FP
equation. The method consisted in looking to the trajectories of the one-
dimensional solution singularities, in the complex plane of the spatial vari-
able. The form of the solution has been assumed as

Our numerical simulations only allow to identify the process of generation
of a chain of vortices, but we cannot pursue too far the simulations due to
accumulation of numerical errors.
It apparently supports a dimension of
about 6.

The stability depends also on the type of perturbation, not only simply of
the amplitude. A monopolar solution is very stable. The HM term renders
the equation fragile to decay into lattice of vortices.

Initial monopolar perturbation

We start by initializing the potential with a monopolar vortex localised in
one of the layers of periodicity. The amplitude of the potential at this run
10−3 (normalised

We note a very stable evolution of the total ﬂow, consisting of a slow
(v∗/u . 1) displacement of the monopole along the layer. In the ﬁrst part
of the evolution, the proﬁle of the monopolar vortex is adapted to the local
speed of the ﬂow, but afterwards the evolution is amazingly stable. The
103Ωi the limit where
duration of this period of stability is greater than 12
the run was stopped.

This conclusion must be useful in relation with the long stability of the
Red Spot of the Jupiter atmosphere. There, the conﬁguration is precisely
the same as in this run: a localised vortex in a structure of zonal ﬂow, as
shown by the observations of Voyager 1 and 2 (see Busse [26]).

Figure 9: The initial perturbation is monopolar and located symmetrically
in a ﬂow layer. The initial (t = 0) and ﬁnal (t = 29µs) potentials are shown.

9.1.3

Initial dipolar perturbation

The initial ﬁeld is φs perturbed by a dipolar vortex placed with maxima
approximately on a line of maximum. The amplitude of φs is 0.03 and that
10−3. The evolution in this case is very stable for all the
of the dipole is 3
103Ωi). We notice the weak
interval of the run (29 µs, corresponding to 12

change of the shape of the dipole due to the interaction with the background
ﬂow, in the ﬁrst part of the run.

Figure 10: A dipolar perturbation is initialised. The initial (t = 0) and ﬁnal
(t = 29µs) potentials are shown.

In another run, the initial ﬁeld φs of amplitude 0.03 has been perturbed
by a dipolar vortex with the same localisation as before but with amplitude
comparable to the background ﬁeld, 0.03. The run evolves without destruc-
tion of the conﬁguration.

Figure 11: An initial stationary ﬂow of higher amplitude is perturbed with
a dipolar vortex of comparable amplitude. Only the scalar nonlinearity is
retained.

From the numerical experiments with the dipolar perturbations it seems
that low amplitude potential φs has weak interaction with the perturbation
and major changes of the ﬂow may probably arise later than several thousends
Ωi.

9.2 Equation with scalar and polarisation drift nonlin-
earities (time dependent Flierl-Petviashvili equa-
tion with Hasegawa-Mima term)

9.2.1

Initial monopolar perturbation

In a series of run we take a higher initial background ﬂow φs, with amplitude
of 0.06 and perturb it with a monopolar structure strongly elongated in
the radial direction. The amplitude of the parturbation is very high, 0.12.
We note that the evolution leads ﬁrst to strong changes of the perturbation
structure which is rotated and deformed. But in the same time the ﬂow
itself tends to be broken into isolated vortices. These runs require higher
numerical precision so that only short period of time can be aﬀorded at this
momant. The evolution was stopped at 6 µs.

Figure 12: A run with both scalar and polarisation nonlinearities retained.
The ﬂow is initialised with a monopolar form perturbing the staionary peri-
odic solution.

The late stages of these runs are useful for the ilustration of the breaking

of the background ﬂow into a lattice of vortices.

A particular importance takes the examination of the evolution of the
ﬂow when the initial perturbation is monopolar and placed approximately in
a layer of periodicity. This should be directly compared with the previous
runs with the pure scalar nonlinearity.

We notice that the stability is much stranger for this type of geometrically
“compatible” perturbation. Neither the background ﬂow nor the vortex is
disturbed for more than 25 µs. The monopole is only advected by the ﬂow.
At late stage, the monopole is deformed and destroyed, while the ﬂow does
not show the previously observed tendency to break into a lattice of vortices.

29

Figure 13: The late stage of a run with monopolar pertubation.The breaking
of the ﬂow into vortices is apparent.

However, the region of the very high amplitude where the monopole existed
tends to break into vortices.

Figure 14: The late stage of a run with monopolar pertubation of high am-
plitude.The breaking into vortices aﬀects ﬁrst the strongest perturbation.

This shows that the Hasegawa-Mima nonlinearity has the property of
inducing a tandency of the ﬂow to break up, under strong perturbation, into
a lattice of monopolar vortices.

9.2.2

Initial dipolar perturbation

A dipolar perturbation shows essentially the same evolution as for monopolar
case. The proﬁle is not changed for rather long period, 20µs but the later
stages consist of a clear decay into a set of distinct formations with monopolar
structure. We cannot follow too far the simulation due to accumulation

30

of errors, but it is clear that space scale of the new vortical structures is
close to those found in preceeding cases. This strengthens the idea that the
polarisation drift nonlinearity is the cause of this evolution toward lattices
of vortices.

Figure 15: Initial dipolar perturbation

9.2.3

Initial oscillatory perturbation

In order to examine the processes of destruction of the ﬂow and decay into
isolated vortices, we initialize with an oscillatory perturbation with a period
much larger than that which seems to be chosen by the system as extension
of the ﬁnal monopolar vortices. The ﬂow clearly evolves to the lattice of
vortices.

Figure 16: Perturbation initialised as a spacial oscillation of large wavelength.

For a higher amplitude of the initial perturbation the evolution is quali-

tatively similar.

31

Figure 17: Initial oscillatory perturbation at higher amplitude.

In a series of runs, we initialise with a perturbation consisting of oscilla-
tions with higher spatial wavenumber, i.e. slightly closer to the ﬁnal vortices.
The result shows clearly that the initial conditions do not inﬂuence signiﬁ-
cantly the space extension of the ﬁnal monopolar vortices, which means that
the system chooses this dimension according to a dispersion relation which
has the character of an space-eigenvale problem. This is also suggested by
the fact thet the ﬁnal stages appears to be similar for rather diﬀerent time
duration which is needed by the system to reach the stage of breaking into
vortices.

wavelength.

9.3 Conclusions from the numerical studies

Extensive numerical simulations (which however must be considered prelim-
inary) have been done for studying the stability of φs. In a series of runs
the time dependent equations with pure scalar nonlinearity has been used
with φs perturbed by φp, taken ﬁrst as a monopolar vortex . For small am-
0.005) the total ﬂow is stable for more
plitudes (e.g. φs ∼
103Ωi. The monopole is reshaped at early stages for equality of
than 12
×
the tangential ﬂows and then is stably advected (v∗/u . 1). This result may
be relevant for the stability of the Red Spot, the long-lived vortex embedded
in the zonal ﬂows of the atmosphere of Jupiter, a geometry very similar to
ours. A small amplitude dipolar initial perturbation is also stable for similar
durations.

0.03 and φp ∼

The structural stability of φs is investigated using the time dependent
equation with both scalar and polarisation drift nonlinearities retaind. The
ﬂow is stable on only shorter duration and a new eﬀect arises: at late stages,
the ﬂow tends to break up into a set of monopolar vortices. Taking φp of
0.12) monopolar and strongly elongated on
high amplitude (φs ∼
r there is a clear tendency to rotate it such as to align with the background
ﬂow. At 6 µs the process of generation of vortices is pronounced. Similar
conclusions can be drawn from runs with φp taken as dipolar and as spatial
periodic structures. Examination of many runs leads to the conclusion that
the spatial extension of the generated vortices depends only weakly on the
initial conditions and of the time duration of quasi-stability and is λ
6ρs .
Higher numerical precision is required to study their evolution.

10 Appendix

10.1 Derivation of the equation with time dependence

The aim of this Appendix is to review the derivation of the various forms of
the equations used in this work. It will be reviewed the stationary and the
time dependent equations, with scalar and polarisation drift nonlinearities,
etc. The main practical purpose is to compare the units used and to facilitate
the present numerical computation and the future possible changes. For this
reason some calculations are trivially simple and may be skiped.

Consider the equations for the ITG model in two-dimensions with adia-

batic electrons:

The diamagnetic velocity will be neglected. Introducing this velocity into the
continuity equation, one obtains an equation for the electrostatic potential
φ.

Before writting this equation we introduce new dimensional units for the

variables.

The new variables (t, x, y) and the function φ are non-dimensional. In the
following the primes are not written. With these variables the equation

NOTE
Before continuing we compare this equation with the equation of paper
[29], Eq.(16). Here taking still the units to be physical, the form of the latter
equation is (Eq.(12) from that paper)

The term containing the gradient of the equilibrium density comes from the
continuity equation, as convection of the equilibrium density by the ﬂuctu-
ating E
B velocity. The term containing the gradient of the equilibrium
temperature comes from the continuity equation by the divergence of the
ﬂuctuating ﬂow of particles, where the adiabaticity has been assumed,

The equation of [29] remains expressed in these terms. However, this is
strange in relation with the derivation made by Lakhin et al, where the
temperature term is canceled. See below a discussion of the Eq.(8) from
Laedke and Spatschek 1986.

of the non-dimensional variables) then in order to recuperate the physical

10.6 The equation derived from Ertel ’s theorem

The derivation of the equation is done on the same basis as the derivation of
Laedke and Spatschek 1988. However, in a series of papers, Su and Horton
[8], [4], develop a more physical justiﬁcation of the scalar nonlinearity model,
although their primary aim was to investigate the stability of the dipolar
(Larichev-Reznik) solution of the Hasegawa-Mima equation.

the line of Lagrangean evolution with the velocity E

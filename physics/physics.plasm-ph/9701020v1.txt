Abstract

In the positive column of a neon glow discharge, two diﬀerent types of ionization
waves occur simultaneously. The low–dimensional chaos arising from the nonlinear
interaction between the two waves is controlled by a continuous feedback technique.
The control strategy is derived from the time–delayed autosynchronization method.
Two spatially displaced points of observation are used to obtain the control infor-
mation, using the propagation characteristics of the chaotic wave.

Due to their inherent nonlinearity, instabilities in plasmas often develop to-
wards chaotic dynamics and turbulence [1]. In many practical cases this is
considered as an undesired situation and there is a particular interest to in-
ﬂuence the plasma system in order to achieve a stationary state (ﬁxed point
in the phase space) or a state of regular motion (limit cycle in the phase
space). The most straightforward approach would be to change the set of dis-
charge parameters to establish a new non–chaotic state. This, of course, may
be cumbersome or even impossible. Recent results [2] have demonstrated the
eﬃciency of chaos control in laboratory plasmas. Moreover, recent computa-
tional studies of chaos control strategies [3] oﬀer the possibility of applications
in fusion plasmas. In the present communication we present a simple contin-
uous feedback technique to control chaotic states in plasmas arising from the
nonlinear interaction of waves. The eﬃciency of the control scheme is demon-
strated experimentally for ionization wave chaos in the positive column of a
glow discharge.

Typically, an inﬁnite number of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) is embed-
ded within a chaotic phase space attractor [4]. This observation motivates the
idea to achieve the stabilization of selected UPOs by means of small time de-
pendent perturbations of an accessible control parameter. Ott, Grebogi, and
Yorke (further referred to as OGY) have proposed an elegant control strategy
based on the stabilization of ﬁxed points in the Poincar´e section [5] that has
achieved a broad ﬁeld of practical applications [6]. The main obstacle for a
universal use of OGY to control chaotic states is the necessity for the online de-
termination of the Poincar´e mapping. Therefore, in non–driven (autonomous)
chaotic systems the OGY scheme is limited by computational speed. In such
situations a control strategy based on information obtained in the time do-
main becomes advantageous. A particular method that uses the information
of previously recorded dynamics to determine the required control information
was proposed by Pyragas [7,8]. It is referred to as time–delay autosynchroniza-
tion (TDAS) method. If, for simplicity, a two-dimensional dynamical system
is considered, TDAS is described by the autonomous system [7]

˙Y = P (X, Y ) + Fτ (Y )
˙X = Q(X, Y ) ,

(1)

where {X(t), Y (t)} represents the state of the system. The unperturbed phase
space ﬂow is given by the functions P and Q. The control signal Fτ (Y ) is ob-
tained by the linear control law Fτ (Y ) = K · [Y (t − τ ) − Y (t)] where τ denotes
an appropriate time delay. It is chosen equal to the fundamental period of the
oscillation signal that corresponds to a particular UPO. The constant factor K
determines the feedback strength and Fτ vanishes if control of the desired peri-
odic orbit is achieved. The TDAS control method has been applied succesfully
to experimental chaotic systems, for instance lasers [9], electronic circuits [8,10]
and plasma discharges [2]. It was extended later for better performance [11,12]
and its mechanism can be understood to some extent now [13]. TDAS and its
variants meet technical limitations, too. The time–delayed signal Y (t − τ ) is
obtained either by delay lines [8–10] (fast systems) or digitally stored data
[2] (slow systems). The subsequently discussed control scheme may overcome
such technical problems.

Starting with a chaotic state, the wave character of dynamics allows us to
stabilize unstable periodic orbits. Considering the fact that temporally peri-
odic states are related to a wavenumber by the dispersion relation, the time
delay τ may be replaced by a spatial displacement such that the condition
ω/k = vϕ = ζ/τ holds,where τ is ﬁxed by the period of the orbit to be sta-
bilized. Here the delay is chosen as τ = ∆z/vϕ with ∆z = nλ. The resulting
control law now reads Fζ(Y ) = K · [Y (z − ζ, t) − Y (z, t)]. It is easily realized
by using a diﬀerential ampliﬁer and two spatially displaced detectors. K is
a constant gain factor that may be determined experimentally. The control

2

signal Fζ(Y ) is applied to an accesible dynamical quantity.

For an experimental demonstration we have chosen the chaotic dynamics of
ionization waves propagating in the positive column of an ordinary glow dis-
charge tube. This system is a representative example for spatially extended
dynamics that contain a wavetrain with a large number of wavelengths. In
certain parameter regions of the pressure p and the discharge current Id, the
positive column is either homogenous or diﬀerent types of ionization waves
occur [14,15]. The nonlinear dynamics of ionization waves in glow discharges
has already been investigated in great detail. Low–dimensional chaos was ﬁrst
observed in autonomous systems with the discharge current as control pa-
rameter [16,17]. In the non–autonomous case, where the discharge current
is modulated by an external periodic driver signal, low–dimensional chaotic
phase space attractors were studied in detail [18–21]. In the latter case, a sim-
pliﬁed variant of the OGY scheme has already been successfully implemented
and UPOs up to periodicity 32 could be stabilized [22]. Note, that the success
of this approach relies on constructing the Poincar´e section by making use
of the periodic external driver signal. In the case of an autonomous chaotic
system it was recently demonstrated in a discharge similar to the one under
investigation that control could be achieved by a slightly modiﬁed variant of
the TDAS scheme [2].

The experimental investigations are performed in a conventional cold-cathode
glow discharge tube. The discharge length is l = 600 mm and the tube has
a radius of r = 15 mm. The ionization waves are observed by picking up the
light emission ﬂux Φ(z, t) with two movable optical ﬁbres connected to fast
photodiodes. The spatial resolution is estimated to be ∆z ≤ 1 cm, which is well
below the typical wavelength of ionization waves. The discharge is operated at
a pressure of p = 1.8 mbar with neon as ﬁlling gas. The discharge current can
be varied between Id = 1 . . . 50 mA. In this pressure range a positive column
forms that extends over 80% of the discharge length. For the present discharge
conditions two diﬀerent types of ionization waves are observed simultaneously
[23,24]: (I) p–waves (due to atomic ions) with a frequency of fp ≈ 3 kHz and a
phase velocity vϕ,p = 247 m/s directed towards the cathode, and (II) s′–waves
(due to metastables) with a frequency of fs′ ≈ 5.6 kHz and a phase velocity
vϕ,s′ = 509 m/s directed towards the anode. Fig. 1 shows time series of the
waves in a mode–locked state. Near the anode the p–wave dominates, whereas
at the cathode a pure s′–wave appears. The frequency matching condition
fs′ = 2fp is met in the midsection of the discharge tube. Since both wave
types propagate simultaneously in the positive column, they show pronounced
nonlinear interaction. Consequently a broad variety of dynamical phenomena
and low–dimensional chaos is observed as mentioned above.

For the practical realization of the control scheme only few conditions have to
be satisﬁed. Due to dispersion and the spatial ampliﬁcation property of the

p–wave (top) and the s–wave (bottom). The time series are recorded at zp = 50 mm
(close to anode) and zs = 580 mm (close to cathode). The waves are mode–locked
where the frequency matching condition fs = 2fp is met in the midsection of the
discharge tube (center).

positive column, the amplitudes of the measured light ﬂuctuations have to be
equalized, so that the control signal depends only on the phase information.
The spacing between the two optical ﬁbres has to be exactly one wavelength
or integer multiples thereof for an optimal control. This ﬁnding supports the
interpretation that the two–point observation acts as a spatial ﬁlter. The axial
position of both ﬁbres, i.e. the distance from the anode is used to adjust the
phase of the control signal.

Fig. 2. Time series of the integral light emission ﬂuctuations (Y (z, t)) and the control
signal. The control is applied at t0 = 58 ms and the stabilization is achieved within
150 ms. The modulation degree of the discharge current Imod/Idc does not exceed
5%. Smaller K-values as well as larger ones lead to a loss of control.

The stabilization of an UPO of a chaotic state arising from the interaction of
two diﬀerent ionization waves is demonstrated in Fig. 2. The control signal
is applied at t0 = 58 ms. After approximately 150 ms a periodic orbit of pe-

Both frequencies (fp and fs) according to the speciﬁc ionization waves are observ-
able. In (b) the reconstructed phase space of the corresponding time series is shown.
The chaotic attractor (D2 = 3.5) is embedded into a smaller space of three dimen-
sions. The cube axes correspond to a time lag of τ = 4 between successive data
points. The number of data points for the reconstruction of the phase space vectors
is N = 10000.

Fig. 4. In (a) the power spectrum of the time series is shown in the controlled state.
Only fs is remaining due to the stabilization of both waves. In (b) the reconstructed
phase space of the corresponding time series is shown. Due to the reduction of
attractor dimensionality (D2 = 1) the embedding into the three–dimensional space
is suﬃcient. The cube axes correspond to a time lag of τ = 4 between successive
data points. The number of data points for the reconstruction of the phase space
vectors is N = 10000.

riodicity P = 1 is fully stabilized as long as the control signal is present. It
was not possible to stabilize UPOs of higher periodicity. This is, however, an
often recognized limitation of continuous feedback techniques [8]. The remain-
ing modulation of the control signal in Fig. 2 is caused by small diﬀerences
in the shape of the ﬂuctuation signals due to the diﬀerent observation points.
The control method is nevertheless quite eﬃcient since the open loop control
would require a much higher amplitude for the suppression of chaos [25]. The
application of control leads to a dramatic decrease (≈70dB) of broad–band
components in the power spectrum [see Figs. 3a and 4a]. In the chaotic state,
the two ionization waves occur as small maxima in a broad spectrum, whereas

5

in the controlled state only one frequency is established. The inspection of
the reconstructed phase space diagrams [see Figs. 3b and 4b] illustrates the
reduction of the attractor’s dimensionality. The correlation dimension [26] of
the chaotic state has been estimated to be D2 = 3.5 ± 0.3. The estimation of

the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and the corresponding Kaplan-Yorke di-
mension [27] (Table 1) was done with the computation program of Kruel and
Eiswirth [28] based on the algorithm of Sano and Sawada [29]. It shows that
two positive Lyapunov exponents are dominating the dynamics (D2 ≃ DKY ).
The uncertainty is estimated by comparing the results of several calculations.
After the stabilization, the dimensionality is reduced to D2 = 1.0 ± 0.2 (limit
cycle).

To summarize, the control of ionization wave chaos in a neon glow discharge
by a continuous control technique where the feedback signal is derived from
spatial displacement of detectors has been demonstrated experimentally. The
control information is easy to determine, the feedback scheme is quite simple
and even fast dynamical systems can be controlled in which digital electronic
fails. In contrast to the TDAS–approach, no time–delay lines and phase shift-
ing circuits are required. The optimum control signal depends sensitively on
the precise distance between the optical ﬁbres and the absolute z-position due
to transit time eﬀects and diﬀering shapes of the wave in the positive column.

This control strategy is expected to be more eﬃcient than earlier attempts
to suppress chaos by a simple open loop control [25] and could be of major
interest in the various chaotic situations frequently observed in plasmas.

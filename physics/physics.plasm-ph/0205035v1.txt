Abstract

Using previously developed method [1, 2] of two-dimensional Laplace transform we
obtain the characteristic equations k(ω) for electromagnetic waves in low-collision fully
ionized plasma of a plane geometry. We apply here a new, diﬀerent from the one used
in [1, 2], iteration procedure of taking into account the Coulomb collisions. The waves are
collisionally damping in the same extent as electromagnetic waves. Despite the diﬀerent
from [2] appearance of the dispersion (poles) equation, the obtained decrements for fast
and slow wave modes coincide with results obtained in [2], if one neglects the terms
of higher orders in v2
x/c2, (vx and c are electron and light velocities). We point out
how one can determine mutually dependent boundary conditions allowing to eliminate
simultaneously both the backward and kinematical waves for transversal as well as for
longitudinal oscillations.

1 Introduction

Propagation of electromagnetic waves in low-collision fully ionized plasma is described by
asymptotic solution of the coupled kinetic and Maxwell equations. The trivial fact is known:
an exponential solution exp(ikx
iωt), proposed by L. Landau in 1946 (in the simplest case
of a plane geometry) with complex ω, is not a solution of either the Vlasov equations (for
longitudinal plasma waves), nor the equations for transversal waves. Nevertheless in the
available literature one is usually admits that namely Landau solution is true but the above
mentioned equations must be correspondingly corrected by additional terms according to
Landau rules of passing around poles in calculation of logarithmically divergent integrals
appearing at substitution of the solution into the primary equations.

The proposed by us method of two-dimensional Laplace transformation combined with
Vlasov prescription of calculating divergent integrals in the sense of principal value allows one
to obtain very simply asymptotical solutions of namely the original primary equations.

In this work we brieﬂy describe both the techniques and the results of the proposed in [2]
new iteration procedure. Following to this method one replaces Laplace image Qp1p2(~ve) of
the Coulomb collision term Q(~ve, x, t) by the term

before, the boundary conditions are not independent and the given boundary electrical ﬁeld
E(0, t) deﬁnes the boundary function f (e)

can be determined through the natural condition of absence of kinematical waves. In the case

These equations deﬁne uniquely the dependence a(~v) = a∗(~v) on ~v. But determined in this
way f (e)
p1 (~v) can not be used to eliminate unphysical backward ﬁeld waves in E(x, t), as was
supposed in [2]. To this end one must use the boundary condition for Fp1 (that is Laplace

Analogous considerations in the case of longitudinal waves lead to the determination of f (e)

but there are no other free boundary conditions to eliminate the backward waves in E(x, t).
This fact leads to the inevitable conclusion that the normal boundary component of electrical
ﬁeld E(0, t) = E0 cos(ωt) is broken at the plasma boundary due to the surface charge. This

3 Conclusions

Coincidence of collisional damping decrements for the two variants of iteration process is an
evidence of the proposed calculation method correctness. The approximation (1) is more
preferable than one used in [1, 2] since it has more evident physical sense. The diﬀerence of
both iteration procedures appears at large values of v2
0x/c2, however in this case there is also
growing contribution of relativistic corrections to the original equations.

The requirements of absence of both unphysical backward (divergent at x

) ﬁeld
waves and kinematical waves smearing electron distribution function f (e)
1 (~v, x, t) in vx lead at
the given boundary ﬁeld E(0, t) to the determination of the boundary distribution function
f (e)
1 (~v, 0, t) and the solution f (e)

1 (~v, x, t) with single-valued dependence on ~v, x, and t.

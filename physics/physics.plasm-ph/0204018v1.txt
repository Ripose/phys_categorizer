Abstract

Dynamics of a charged relativistic particle in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld and an obliquely propa-

gating electrostatic shock wave is considered. The system is reduced to a two degrees of freedom

Hamiltonian system with slow and fast variables. In this system, the phenomenon of capture into

resonance can take place. Under certain condition, a captured phase point stays captured forever.

This corresponds to unlimited surﬁng acceleration of the particle. The preprint is a more detailed

version of a comment on the paper by D.Ucer and V.D.Shapiro [1], intended for the Comments

section of Physical Reviews Letters.

In Letter [1], unlimited surﬁng acceleration of relativistic particles by a shock wave normal

to a uniform magnetic ﬁeld was considered. The mechanisms of surﬁng acceleration were

studied in many papers, mainly in the case of acceleration by a harmonic wave. The aim

of this comment is to point out that the methods developed in [2] allow for more detailed

study and further progress in the topic of shock wave acceleration. In particular, the case of

an oblique shock wave can be considered. Also, it can be shown that particles with initial

velocities far from the shock wave velocity can also be captured in the mode of unlimited

acceleration.

Like in [1], consider a charged relativistic particle of charge e and rest mass m in a uniform

magnetic ﬁeld B and an electrostatic shock wave of potential Φ =

Φ0 tanh(kq

ωt), where

Choose an orthogonal coordinate system (q1, q2, q3) such that B = B0e3 is along the q3-axis

and k lies in the (q1, q3)-plane, k = (k1, 0, k3). The Hamiltonian function of the particle is

in variable I is a value of order ε, and hence the trajectory of the particle in the (p, q, I)-

space lies in a vicinity of the intersection of a second order surface

I =const. This intersection is an ellipse corresponding to the Larmor motion. However,
along a trajectory that crosses the resonance ˙φ = ∂

The resonant condition ∂

0/∂I = 0 deﬁnes a surface I = Ires(p, q) in the (p, q, I)-space,

called the resonant surface. The condition implies that projection of the particle’s velocity

onto the direction of vector k equals the phase velocity of the wave.

Intersection of the

resonant surface and the surface

0 =const is a second order curve whose kind depends

H

on the parameter values (see [2]). This curve is called the resonant curve. The motion

in a neighborhood (of the width of order √ε) of the resonant surface possesses certain

universal properties ([2], [3]). In particular, the Hamiltonian F =

/ε of the particle in this

H

neighborhood can be written in the form:

F = ε−1Λ(p, q) + F0(P, φ, p, q) + O(√ε),

In the system deﬁned by F , variables (p, q) are slow and variables (P, φ) are fast. Slow

evolution of (p, q) is determined by a system with Hamiltonian √εΛ. This system deﬁnes

a ﬂow on the resonant surface, called resonant ﬂow. The (P, φ) variables evolve according

to the subsystem with Hamiltonian F0. If 0 < b < 1, there is a separatrix surrounding the

oscillation region on the phase portrait of this subsystem (see Figure 1). If b < 0 or b > 1,

there is no oscillation region.

The area of the oscillation region S is a function of the slow variables: S = S(p, q).

If S(p, q) enlarges along the resonant ﬂow, additional area appears inside the oscillation

3

region. Hence, phase points cross the separatrix and enter the oscillation region. This is

a capture into resonance. A captured phase point leaves a vicinity of the curve I =const,

0 =const and continues its motion following approximately the resonant curve. Note, that

H
phase points with arbitrarily large initial values of P can be captured provided they are

close enough to the incoming invariant manifold of the saddle point of the “pendulum-like”

system. This corresponds to the fact that a particle can be trapped in the mode of surﬁng

acceleration even in the case that initially it is far from the resonance.

The area bounded by the trajectory of a captured phase point in the (P, φ)-plane is an

adiabatic invariant of the “pendulum-like” system. Hence, if S(p, q) contracts along the

resonant ﬂow, some phase points leave the oscillation region and leave the resonant zone.

This is an escape from the resonance. If S monotonically grows along the resonant curve,

none of phase points leave the oscillation region. In this case, captured phase points stay

captured forever.

If the resonant curve is a hyperbola (k3 < ω, [2]) or a parabola (k3 = ω,

0 < 0, [2]),

H

a captured phase point may go to inﬁnity.

In this motion the energy of the particle H

(see (1)) tends to inﬁnity. Therefore, this motion produces unlimited surﬁng acceleration

of particles. This acceleration is possible, if S(p, q) grows as p, q

along the resonant

curve. Calculations (see [2]) give the following necessary condition of possibility of unlimited

acceleration:

This condition was ﬁrst obtained in [4] for acceleration by a harmonic wave. In the case of

perpendicular propagation, it is equivalent to the condition of Katsouleas and Dawson [5],

also mentioned in [1].

Consider a hyperbolic resonant curve under assumption that (5) is valid. At q < 0,

b(p, q) < 0 (see (4)) and S(p, q) = 0. At q = 0, function S(p, q) has a singularity and at

small positive q it is very large. As q grows along the resonant curve, S(p, q) ﬁrst decreases

and then, as q

, S(p, q)

. Hence, at a certain q = qm, function S(p, q) has minimum

→ ∞

→ ∞

S = Sm along the resonant curve. Consider a phase point that is initially captured into the

resonance at small positive value of q. Let the area bounded by its trajectory be S0 and

S0 > Sm. Then in the course of motion along the resonant curve this phase point escapes

from the resonance.

If S0 < Sm, the phase point stays captured forever and undergoes

4

unlimited acceleration. This explains Fig. 5 in [1]. The number of bounces in this ﬁgure

corresponds to the number of oscillations of the phase point inside the oscillatory region of

the “pendulum-like” system, performed before the phase point escapes from the resonance.

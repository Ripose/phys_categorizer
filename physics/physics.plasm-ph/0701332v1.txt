Abstract

The dynamics of transient electric ﬁelds generated by the interaction of high intensity laser pulses

with underdense plasmas has been studied experimentally with the proton projection imaging

technique. The formation of a charged channel, the propagation of its front edge and the late electric

ﬁeld evolution have been characterised with high temporal and spatial resolution. Particle-in-cell

simulations and an electrostatic, ponderomotive model reproduce the experimental features and

trace them back to the ponderomotive expulsion of electrons and the subsequent ion acceleration.

The study of the propagation of intense laser pulses in underdense plasmas is relevant to

several highly advanced applications, including electron [1] and ion acceleration [2], develop-

ment of X- and γ-ray sources [3], and fusion neutron production [4]. It is also of fundamental

interest, due to the variety of relativistic and nonlinear phenomena which arise in the laser-

plasma interaction [5]. Among these, self-focusing and self-channeling of the laser pulse

arise in this regime from the intensity dependence of the relativistic index of refraction and

the ponderomotive expulsion of plasma from the propagation axis [6, 7]. For intense pulses,

charge separation eﬀects become important and the pulse can propagate self-guided in a

charged channel [8]. Several experiments have investigated this regime, mostly providing

indirect evidence of self-channeling via optical diagnostics [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. A related

phenomenon is the acceleration of ions in the space-charge ﬁeld of the channel [4, 12, 13].

The development of the proton projection imaging technique [16] has provided a very

powerful tool to explore the fast dynamics of plasma phenomena via the detection of the as-

sociated transient electric ﬁeld structures [17, 18]. In this Letter, we report on an experiment

using the proton imaging technique to study of the formation and subsequent evolution of a

charge-displacement channel in an underdense plasma. These investigations have led to the

ﬁrst direct experimental detection of the transient electric ﬁelds in the channel, providing an

insight of the fundamental physical processes involved. The comparison of the experimental

data with two-dimensional (2D) electromagnetic(EM) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and

a simple one-dimensional (1D) electrostatic (ES) PIC model allows to characterize in detail

the electric ﬁeld dynamics at diﬀerent stages of its evolution.

The experiment was carried out at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, employing the

VULCAN Nd-Glass laser system [14], providing two Chirped Pulse Ampliﬁed (CPA) pulses,

with 1.054 µm wavelength, synchronized with picosecond precision. Each of the beams

delivered approximately 30 J on target in 1.3 ps (FWHM) duration. By using f /6 oﬀ-axis

parabolas, the beams were focused to spots of 10 µm (FWHM) achieving peak intensities
1019 W cm−2. The short pulses were preceded by an Ampliﬁed Spontaneous
106 [15]. One of the

beams (CPA1) was directed to propagate through He gas from a supersonic nozzle, having

a 2 mm aperture, driven at 50 bar pressure. The interaction was transversely probed by

the proton beam produced from the interaction of the second CPA beam (CPA2) with a ﬂat

foil (a 10 µm thick Au foil was typically used), under the point projection imaging scheme

2

[16]. The schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Fig.1(a). Due to the Bragg peak

energy deposition properties of the protons, the use of multilayered stacks of Radiochromic

ﬁlm (RCF) detector permits energy-resolved monitoring of the proton probe proﬁle, as each

layer will primarily detect protons within a given energy range. This allows to obtain single-

shot, multi-frame temporal scans of the interaction in a time-of-ﬂight arrangement [16]. The

spatial and temporal resolution of each frame were of the order of a few ps, and of a few

microns, respectively, while the magniﬁcation was 11.

The interaction region was also diagnosed by Nomarsky interferometry, employing a fre-

quency doubled CPA pulse of low energy. The reconstructed electron density proﬁle along

the propagation axis before the high-intensity interaction [see Fig. 1(b)], broadly consistent

with the neutral density proﬁle of the gas jet [19] suggests complete ionisation of the gas by

the ASE prepulse.

Fig. 2 shows time-resolved proton-projection images where the coordinates x and y refer to

the object (interaction) plane, which intersects the probe axis at (x, y) = (0, 0). Each frame

detects protons of a given energy E and is labelled according to the arrival time t0(E) at the

object plane of the protons travelling along the probe axis, relative to a reference time t = 0

that corresponds to the estimated arrival of the peak of the CPA1 at its focal plane x = 0.

Due to the divergence of the probe beam, the probing time (proton crossing time of the object

plane) varies along the CPA1 propagation axis as τ (x, E)

Fig. 2(a), (b) and (c) show diﬀerent frames from the same shot (obtained at an intensity

In the trail of the channel the proton ﬂux distribution around the axis changes qualita-

tively [see Fig. 2(c)], showing a dark line along the axis, which is observed up to tens of

ps after the transit of the peak of the pulse. Fig. 2(d) shows a proton image obtained in a
1019 W cm−2), where the features observed in Fig. 2(c) are

shot at higher intensity (1.5

×

even more pronounced. A faint, wide feature, vaguely identiﬁable in the right end side of

Figs. 2(a) and (b) and visible also in images corresponding to earlier times, can be associated

to the pre-formed plasma created by the ASE pedestal, seen in Fig. 1(b).

The ’white’ channel indicates the presence of a positively charged region around the

laser axis, where the electric ﬁeld points outwards, along the radial direction. This can

be interpreted as the result of the expulsion of electrons from the central region due to

the radial ponderomotive force (PF). The central dark line observed at later times in the

channel suggests that at this stage the radial electric ﬁeld must change its sign at some

radial position (in other words, the radial ﬁeld points inwards in the vicinity of the axis

and outwards at larger distances from it), focusing the probe protons towards the axis. As

discussed below, this dynamics is related to the radial acceleration of ions by the charge

separation ﬁeld.

The main features of the channel observed in the experimental data are qualitatively

reproduced in 2D EM PIC simulations in planar geometry, for a range of parameters close

to the experiment.

In the simulation of Fig. 3, the laser pulse has a Gaussian intensity

proﬁle both in space and time, with peak dimensionless amplitude a0 = 2, radius r0 = 4λ

and duration τ0 = 300λ/c where λ is the laser wavelength. For λ = 1 µm the pulse duration
1018 W cm−2, respectively. The charge-to-mass

and intensity correspond to 1 ps and 5.5

×

ratio of ions is Z/A = 1/2. The electron density grows linearly along the x-axis from zero to
the peak value n0 = 0.1nc (where nc is the critical density and nc = 1021 cm−3 for λ = 1 µm)

over a length of 400λ, and then remains uniform for 200λ. A 6500

1200 numerical grid,

×

a spatial resolution ∆x = ∆y = λ/10 and 16 particles per cell for both electrons and ions

were used.

Fig. 3 shows the ion density (ni) and the components Ey and Ez of the electric ﬁeld at

the time t = 600λ/c

2.0 ps.

In this simulation the laser pulse is s-polarized, i.e. the

≃

polarization is along the z axis, perpendicular to the simulation plane. Thus, in Fig. 3 Ez is

representative of the amplitude of the propagating EM pulse, while Ey is generated by the

space-charge displacement. Simulations performed for the case of p-polarization showed no

4

substantial diﬀerences in the electrostatic ﬁeld pattern. The simulation clearly shows the

formation of an electron-depleted channel, resulting in an outwardly directed radial space-

charge electric ﬁeld whose peak value is 6.7

1010 V/m (see the lineout at x = 410λ in

×
Fig.3). In the region behind the peak of the pulse, two narrow ambipolar fronts (one on

either side of the propagation axis) are observed. The ambipolar ﬁelds have peak values of

6

1010 V/m (see the lineout at x = 325λ in Fig.3). As shown below, such a radial electric

≃
ﬁeld proﬁle produces a pattern in the proton images similar to that observed in region (III)

×

of Fig. 2.

In order to unfold the physical mechanisms associated with the dynamics of the charged

channel, a 1D ES PIC model in cylindrical geometry was employed, in which the laser

action is modeled solely via the PF of a non-evolving laser pulse. A similar approach has

been previously used by other authors [11, 13]. The code solves the equation of motion

for plasma particles along the radial direction, taking into account the ES ﬁeld obtained
mec2∂r[1 + a2(r, t)/2]1/2,

from Poisson’s equation and the PF acting on the electrons Fr =
where a(r, t) = a0e−r2/2r2
0 f (t) and f (t) deﬁnes the temporal envelope of the laser pulse. For
the latter, a ’sin2’ proﬁle was used (the use of a Gaussian proﬁle did not yield signiﬁcant

−

diﬀerences).

Fig. 4 shows the electric ﬁeld Er(r, t) and the ion density ni(r, t) obtained from a simu-

lation with r0 = 7.5λ, a0 = 2.7 and initial density 0.01nc. The initial depletion of electrons

and the later formation of an ambipolar electric ﬁeld front are clearly evident. In order to

achieve a direct comparison with the experimental data, a 3D particle tracing simulation,

employing the PTRACE code [18], was carried out to obtain the proton images for an elec-

tric ﬁeld given by E(x, r, t) = ˆrEr(r, t

x/c). The experimental proton source characteristics

−

(e.g. spectrum and divergence), the detector conﬁguration and dose response were taken

into account. A simulated proton image, reproducing well the main features observed in the

experiment, is shown in Fig. 4(c). The ’bullet’ tip is located 0.75 ps ahead of the pulse peak,

in fair agreement with the previous estimate based on the data.

A detailed theoretical description of the dynamics observed in the 1D simulations is

reported in Ref.[20]). An essential description can be given as follows. In the ﬁrst stage, Fr

pushes part of the electrons outwards, quickly creating a positively charged channel along

the axis and a radial ES ﬁeld which holds the electrons back, balancing almost exactly the
PF, i.e. eEr ≃

Fr; thus, the electrons are in a quasi–equilibrium state, and no signiﬁcant

local charge neutrality. However, the ions retain the velocity acquired during the acceleration

stage. For r > rmax, where rmax is the position of the PF maximum, the force on the ions, and

thus the ion ﬁnal velocity, decrease with r; as a consequence, the ions starting at a position

ri(0) > rmax are ballistically focused towards a narrow region at the edge of the intensity

proﬁle, and reach approximately the same position (r

15 µm) at the same time (t

3 ps,

≃

i.e. 2 ps after the peak of the laser pulse); here they pile up producing a very sharp peak of ni.

Correspondingly, the ion phase space shows that the fastest ions (with energies

400 keV,

≃

≃

of the order of the time-averaged ponderomotive potential) overturn the slowest ones and

hydrodynamical breaking of the ion ﬂuid occurs. Using a simple model [20], the “breaking”
tp + (π/2√2)e3/4p(A/Z)(mp/me)(r0/a0c)
time and position can be estimated to be τb ≃
(3/2)3/2r0,
(where tp = 1 ps is the time at which the pulse has maximum amplitude) and rb ≃

In conclusion, we have reported the ﬁrst direct experimental study of the electric ﬁeld

dynamics in a charge-displacement channel produced by the interaction of a high intensity

laser pulse with an underdense plasma. The ﬁeld proﬁles observed clearly identify diﬀerent

stages of the channel evolution: the electron depletion near the axis due to the ponderomo-

tive force, and the following ion acceleration causing a ﬁeld inversion along the radius. The

features observed are reproduced and interpreted by means of 1D electrostatic and 2D elec-

Abstract

It is proposed that shock wave dynamics within the gas of a small bubble explain

sonoluminescence, the emission of visible radiation. As the bubble radius oscillates, shock

waves develop from spherical sound waves created inside the gas bubble. As any such

shock propagates toward the center, it strengthens and, upon convergence and subsequent

reﬂection, temperature of gas inside bubble increases dramatically in such a way that it

can produce plasma. Since main radiation product in exploding epoch, nonadiabatic

condition for imploding shock wave cool plasma and cause exploding shock wave can not

suﬃciently rise temperature to produce radiation. In this work we compare cooling time

for plasma by bermsstrahlung radiation with collapsing time for the imploding shock

wave . We ﬁnd a constraint on radius of bubble with respect to temperature of water.

This constraint condition explains experimental results as to, why the cold water is ﬁne

for SL.

Introduction

Sonoluminescence, the phenomenon of emission of light from small bubble occurring during

ultrasonic excitation, has been known for more than half a century.

In this phenomenon

an intense standing wave increases the pulsation of a bubble of gas trapped at a velocity

node to attain suﬃcient amplitude so as to emit picosecond ﬂash of light. The analysis of

the dynamics of a small bubble or cavity in a ﬂuid dates back to the work of Lord Rayleigh

[1] at the beginning of this century. A large number of publications followed in subsequent

decades, including the studies of oscillating bubbles by Plesset [2], Eller & Crum , Flynn[3],

Lauterborn[4], Prosperetti[5], and many others. Experiments indicate that the collapse is

remarkably spherical, and that water is the best ﬂuid for SL. Some noble gas is essential

for stable SL, and that the light intensity increases as ambient temperature is lowered. The

theory of light emitting mechanism is still open, but the traditional scenario is supersonic

bubble collapse launching an imploding shock wave which ionizes the bubble contains so as

cause it to emit. Bremsstrahlung radiation is the best theory for SL phenomenon. In the

theory of radiation by Bremsstrahlung as the bubble collapses, produced shock wave ionized

the gas and cause it to radiate. The imploding shock wave concentrated at the center of

bubble, through this concentration, shock wave warmed the gas until will receive to the

center of bubble and explode, through this explosion gas which was compressed just behind

the imploding shock front now ﬁnds itself in front of the shock front again. As the shock

passes through these particles a second time, there is another burst of heating and maximum

temperature reached by the exploding shock wave [6]. The mean idea of our work is that, if in

the imploding regime the plasma cools by radiation then in the exploding epoch, shock front

can not warm particles again to produce intensive radiation. Thus by comparing cooling time

with dynamical time for collapsing, we can say that if cooling time is less than collapsing

time then plasma inside bubble will cool and the exploding shock wave can not warm this

gas again. This constraint gives us some useful parameter for SL, therefore, we can explain

results of some experiments such as why the light intensity increases as ambient temperature

is lowered[7].

2 Collapse Mechanism and radiation

Explanation of the light-emitting mechanism of SL naturally seeks to interpret the featureless

spectrum in terms of emission from a hot spot, for example black body radiation, if the

radiation and matter are near to equilibrium, or Bremsstrahlung from accelerating unbound

electrons if the light-emitting region is hot enough to be ionized yet suﬃciently rareﬁed so as

to be transparent to radiation[8]. The shock wave model [9,10,6,11] provides an extra stage

of energy focusing by assuming that supersonic inward collapse of the bubble wall launches

a shock wave into the bubble’s interior. This shock can run through the already compressed

gas inside the bubble, increasing its amplitude and speed as it focuses towards the origin.

There is now a surface of radius Rs (the radius of the shock front), within the bubble of

radius R. The similarity solution is obtained by assuming that the shock radius takes this

form :

Rs = A(−t)α,

(Guderley 1942) [12] where time is measured from the time of the convergence of the shock,

and A is the ”launch” condition of the shock, which couples the shock to the bubble motion.

The similarity solution yields an exponent α of 0.72 in air and 0.69 for noble gases. Since

the exponent is less that unity, the Mach number of shock as goes to the origin approaches

inﬁnity. The bubble wall is collapsing at the speed of sound when it is passing through its

ambient radius. In this case (Barber et al)[6] showed that:

where

In terms of Mach number

one can deﬁne dynamical time or collapsing time according to:

where tdy is the time scale for the shock to have a radius smaller than Rs. As the shock

wave approaches the center the temperature immediately behind the imploding shock front

increases by this factor T
T0

= M 2. When the shock wave converges to the origin it explodes

from the origin with the same similarity solution. Thus the gas which was compressed just

behind imploding shock front now ﬁnds itself in the front of the shock front again. As the

shock passes through these particles a second time, there is another burst of heating and the

maximum temperatures reached by the exploding shock wave now increases by the factor

T
T0

= M 4[7].

3 Cooling Condition for Radiation

The temperature increase inside the bubble by shock wave ionizes the region. The free

electrons released by the heating will accelerate and radiate light as they collide with the

ions. The Bremsstrahlung radiation generated per second per volume is equal to :

where e and m are the electron charge and mass, n the density of free electrons and ions, c

the speed of light, and gB the Gount factor. In the temperature of T, the energy density of

this plasma is equal to:

As the bubble collapses the value of n changes with the radius, by using the dynamical

equation of shock wave we can interpret the above density in terms of initial density and

radius of gas in the bubble as:

(

then for the imploding shock wave, as the shock wave implodes toward the origin, plasma

cannot cool thus adiabatic condition holds. So in the explosion epoch temperature can rise

suﬃciently to produce an extensive radiation. Now if tcool < tdy, then as the imploding

shock wave implodes towards the center of bubble by the radiation mechanism, plasma cools

and temperature can not rise in such a way that exploding shock can produce an intensive

radiation. As mentioned before, temperature behind the shock wave rises by a factor of T
TR

=

M 2, where T (R) is the temperature of the bubble when its radius is R. For the constraint

tcool > tdyn, temperature of gas inside the bubble rises with an adiabatic compressing:

where T0 is the ambient temperature of bubble and R0 is the size of the bubble when it is in

a static mechanical equilibrium. By using shock wave dynamics, the above equation can be

obtained in terms of Mach number, so we have:

T (R) = T0(

In the

Bremsstrahlung radiation we considered all of our gases to be ionized. Veriﬁcation of that

statement can be obtained by Saha’s equation

(18)

where q = ne

n is the degree of ionization, χ is the ionization potential, and the pre factor T
is given in Kelvin. If we put the given parameters for SL in Saha’s equation for air, we ﬁnd

that ne = ni = n. This is the reason for considering completely ionized gas Bremsstrahlung

formula. The inequality curve of Eq.(17) gives us a constraint for producing radiation in

SL (Fig). On the other hand Bradley et al (1994) show the extreme sensitivity of SL to

external parameters such as the water temperature. They show that as the water temperature
decreases from 40◦ to 1◦, the intensity of light emission increases by a factor of over 200 . At
about 0◦ the purple light emitted by the bubble is so bright that one can see it by an unaided
eye, but at 40◦ the SL is barely visible even in a darkened room. According to Bradley et

al (1994) by light scattering technique initial radius of bubble obtained respect to ambient

temperature. Comparing constraint curve for SL with the experimental relation between
ambient radius of bubble and temperature (Fig), we see that above about 25◦ constraint for

SL breaks down and conﬁrms the experiment results of Bradley et al (1994).

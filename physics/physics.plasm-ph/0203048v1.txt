It is a topological

An expression for a third-order link integral of three magnetic ﬁelds is
invariant and therefore an invariant of ideal
presented.
magnetohydrodynamics. The integral generalizes existing expressions for third-
order invariants which are obtained from the Massey triple product, where the
three ﬁelds are restricted to isolated ﬂux tubes. The derivation and interpretation
of the invariant shows a close relationship with the well-known magnetic helicity,
which is a second-order topological invariant. Using gauge ﬁelds with an SU (2)
symmetry, helicity and the new third-order invariant originate from the same
identity, an identity which relates the second Chern class and the Chern-Simons
three-form. We present an explicit example of three magnetic ﬁelds with non-
disjunct support. These ﬁelds, derived from a vacuum Yang-Mills ﬁeld with
a non-vanishing winding number, possess a third-order linkage detected by our
invariant.

1. Introduction

The topological structure of magnetic ﬁelds is an important subject in plasma physics.
There, among other issues, it is related to the problem of stability of a plasma and to its
energy content. Fields with an enormous wealth of entangled, braided or knotted ﬁeld
lines exist for example in the solar atmosphere. Note that the topological complexity
of these solar magnetic ﬁelds is only revealed, if ﬁrst, one takes into account that
the observed loops anchored in the photosphere are closed by subphotospheric ﬁelds,
and second, that already simple toroidal equilibria contain many diﬀerent knotted
and linked ﬁeld lines. The simplest examples are the so called torus knots, which are
formed by ﬁeld lines where the quotient of the number of windings around the core
and the torus axis is rational.

In general, magnetic ﬁelds in plasmas are not static, but evolve due to the
motion of the plasma. The evolution of solar as well as most astrophysical
magnetic ﬁelds is given in good approximation by the induction equation of ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (IMHD)

which shows that the ﬁeld can be considered as frozen-in with respect to the plasma
velocity v. The approximation of IMHD which leads to this law is valid as long as the
evolution does not lead to small scale structures, e.g. thin current sheets.

The ideal induction equation guarantees the conservation of the topology of ﬁeld
lines under the ﬂow of v, i.e. every linkage or knottedness of magnetic ﬂux is preserved.
Mathematically speaking, the ﬂow of v is a diﬀerentiable isotopy of the space under
consideration. It maps the ﬁeld lines of B at time t0 to a topologically equivalent set of
ﬁeld lines for any later time t > t0. Let us note that, following the usual terminology
in plasma physics, the term ‘topological equivalent’ is used here in the sense of a
diﬀeomorphic isotopy.

In order to describe the structure of magnetic ﬁelds,

it is desirable to have
measures of complexity. These measures should be topological, i.e. they should be
invariant under an arbitrary isotopy of the magnetic ﬁeld, and therefore invariant
under the ideal induction equation. An example of a topological measure for magnetic
ﬁelds is the magnetic helicity, a quantity which has attracted a great deal of attention
in recent years (see e.g. Brown et al 1999). Magnetic helicity, which measures the
linkage of magnetic ﬂux, is only a lowest order topological measure. It fails for instance
to detect the interlocking of magnetic ﬂux tubes in form of the Borromean rings or
the Whitehead link (see Figure 1). The total magnetic helicity of these conﬁgurations
vanishes just as it does for three or two unlinked ﬂux tubes. Both conﬁgurations must
possess a higher order linkage or knottedness of magnetic ﬂux which is not detected
by magnetic helicity. This naturally raises the question whether corresponding higher
order measures similar to magnetic helicity exist which are sensitive to these linkages.
Here we would like to remark that the conﬁgurations shown in Figure 1 are highly
idealized. In any real plasma we would not ﬁnd this pure linkage but a mixture of
diﬀerent types of linkages, each of which is to be measured by a diﬀerent integral.
the
In knot theory diﬀerent invariants are known which distinguish e.g.
Borromean rings or the Whitehead link from unlinked rings. The problem is that
invariants used in physical applications, e.g.
in magnetohydrodynamics, should be
expressed in terms of observable quantities, in our setting in terms of the magnetic
ﬁeld B. Up to now only the helicity, which is related to the Gauß linking number,
has been formulated as an invariant for magnetic ﬁelds in a satisfactory manner.
As was recognized ﬁrst by Monastyrsky and Sasorov (1987) and independently by
Berger (1990) and Evans and Berger (1992), the link invariants based on so-called
higher Massey products (see Massey 1958, 1969, Kraines 1966, Fenn 1983) can be
written as invariants applicable to magnetic ﬂux tubes. Similar to helicity, they only
involve the magnetic ﬁelds and can be expressed as volume integrals over the space in
consideration. Their disadvantage is that their usage is restricted to magnetic ﬁelds
conﬁned to isolated ﬂux tubes. In addition, these ﬂux tubes must not possess a linkage

Third-order topological invariant

lower than the linkage which is measured.

In this paper we present a generalized third-order invariant for three magnetic
ﬁelds not conﬁned to isolated ﬂux tubes. In the case of isolated ﬂux tubes this invariant
coincides with the invariant known from the Massey triple product. Using gauge
ﬁelds in the context of an SU (2) symmetry, the generalized invariant can be shown to
originate from the same equation as helicity. Therefore, we will ﬁrst recapitulate some
basic facts about magnetic helicity before we turn to our main subject, the third-order
link invariant.

2. Magnetic helicity

Magnetic helicity of a ﬁeld B with arbitrary vector potential A is deﬁned as

H(B) =

A

B d3x ,

·

ZV

B

n
|∂V = 0,

·

which can readily be shown to be gauge invariant if no magnetic ﬂux crosses the
boundary of the volume. Since it is quadratic in magnetic ﬂux it is often referred to
as a second-order topological invariant. Magnetic helicity measures the total mutual
linkage of magnetic ﬂux. This interpretation can be motivated if we envisage a
simple system of two isolated and closed ﬂux tubes U1 and U2 with vanishingly small
cross-section. The latter condition ensures that the (self-)helicities of the ﬂux tubes
vanish. Moﬀatt (1969) has shown that for this conﬁguration the helicity integral yields
H(B) = 2 φ1φ2 lk(U1, U2), where lk(U1, U2) is the Gauß linking number (Gauß 1867)
of the two tubes and where φi is the magnetic ﬂux in the tube Ui. Introducing an
asymptotic linking number, Arnol’d (1974) was able to extend this interpretation to
the generic case where ﬁeld lines are not necessarily closed (see also Arnol’d & Khesin
1998, Part III,

4).

Similar to helicity we can introduce the more general cross-helicity of two
magnetic ﬁelds B1 and B2. For a simply connected volume V and provided that

H(B1, B2) measures purely the cross linkage of ﬂux among the two ﬁelds. Applied
to our system of two isolated closed ﬂux tubes with ﬁelds B1 + B2 = B in the
corresponding tubes this invariant yields

H(B1, B2) = 2 φ1φ2 lk(U1, U2),

which is now valid without the assumption of vanishingly small tube cross-sections.

3. A third-order invariant from the Chern-Simons three-form

In this section we construct a third-order invariant which, under conditions speciﬁed
below, yields an invariant for three magnetic ﬁelds. The derivation is based on some
basic knowledge in diﬀerential geometry found e.g. in Frankel (1997).

We have noted before that equation (5) can be derived purely from the

homogeneous Maxwell equations. Written in diﬀerential forms it reads

d(A

dA) = F

F ,

∧

∧

where A is the one-form potential of the ﬁeld F . The right-hand side of this equation
is one of two (pseudo-) scalar Lorentz invariants that can be constructed from the
ﬁeld tensor. We can interpret this equation as a special case of a general result in the
theory of Chern forms, namely the exactness of the second Chern form

Working with an SU (2) structure group it is appropriate to choose the Pauli
matrices σi, i=1, 2, 3, as a basis for the Lie Algebra su(2). All results, however, are
independent of this choice. The gauge potential A and ﬁeld strength F now have three
components

A = σiAi,

F = σiF i,
where the summation convention over repeated indices is assumed. Let us note that
in the following we will refer to these ﬁelds as Yang-Mills ﬁelds, although they do not
necessarily satisfy the Yang-Mills equation. Using the identities for Pauli matrices

If we now interpret the three components of the Yang-Mills potential A as three

states the helicity conservation (in IMHD) for the sum of the self-helicities of the three
individual ﬁelds F i

Integrating over the volume V yields the total time derivative of H (3) on the left-
hand side, while the right-hand side can be converted into a surface integral, analogous
to equation (8) in the case of helicity. The surface integral vanishes since condition
(ii) of the theorem implies Gi
B = 0 on the boundary of the volume V . This, together
with the gauge invariance of H (3) shown in Appendix B, completes the proof.

4. Interpretation of the invariant

It is interesting to note that the new third-order invariant comes on an equal footing as
the conservation of helicity, since both invariants where derived from the same identity
(10). However, contrary to the conservation of helicity, the third-order integral cannot
be applied to a single magnetic ﬁeld, but requires a triplet of ﬁelds. Thus we have to
interpret this integral in the sense of the cross-helicity rather than the total helicity.
A forthcoming paper will deal with the question of how a single magnetic ﬁeld might
Gi = 0, thereby linking
be split into a triplet of ﬁelds with the required properties
the given cross third-order invariant and a total third-order invariant.

There is another way of looking at the new third-order invariant. By writing

H (3)(B1, B2, B3) =

A1

G1

B d3x = H(B1, G1

the integral is to be interpreted as the cross-helicity of the two divergence-free ﬁelds B1

and G1
n = 0
and G1
n = 0, are fulﬁlled due to condition (ii) of the theorem. From this new

interpretation the condition
B = 0 is an obvious requirement analogous to

which reveals the additional conditions
B = 0. Let us note that
this interpretation does not simplify the direct calculation of the third-order invariant.
It is still necessary to determine the ﬁelds Gi

Third-order linking integrals for magnetic ﬁelds have been constructed from the
Massey triple product already by Monastyrsky and Sasorov (1987), Berger (1990) and
also Ruzmaikin and Akhmetiev (1994). However, these constructions are limited to
cases where the three ﬁelds are conﬁned to three isolated and mutually unlinked ﬂux

tubes with disjunct support. It is in fact easy to see that for this special case their
invariants coincide with the integral (19) given above. An explicit proof is given in
Appendix C. In particular, it is worth noting that for ﬁelds with mutually disjunct
B = 0 implies that the cross-helicity of all pairs of ﬁelds
support the condition
vanishes, i.e. their ﬂux tubes have to be mutually unlinked.

For a set of three arbitrary magnetic ﬁelds

B = 0 cannot always be satisﬁed.
To show that there are examples for which this can be satisﬁed, beyond the cases of
three ﬁelds with mutually disjunct support, we give an explicit example in the next
section.

5. Example of three magnetic ﬁelds with a third-order linkage

In this section we want to give an example of three magnetic ﬁelds not conﬁned to
ﬂux tubes, which ﬁrstly allow for one-form potentials that obey d(Ai
Aj) = 0 and
where secondly the integral invariant (19) yields a non-trivial result. The existence of
such an example proves that the new invariant is indeed a generalization of the third-
order invariant derived from a Massey triple product which was applicable merely to
unlinked ﬂux tubes. The ﬁelds we construct show an extraordinary high symmetry.
For this reason they are interesting in their own right.

Aj) = 0 comes

we immediately observe that dF = 0 is a suﬃcient condition for all d(Ai
Aj) to
vanish. In the special case of a vacuum Yang-Mills ﬁeld, i.e. F = 0, the requirement
dF = 0 is trivially fulﬁlled. If we now reinterpret the three components of the Yang-
Mills potential as potentials of three independent magnetic ﬁelds, we have constructed
an example ﬁeld conﬁguration to which the invariant (19) can be applied.

seen in equations (32) and (33) below.

As mentioned above we now interpret the three components of the non-Abelian
pure gauge Yang-Mills potential A as potentials of three independent, non-vanishing
magnetic ﬁelds. It is suﬃcient to consider only one of the three potentials Ai, since
due to ˆni = xi/
and the cyclic symmetry of equation (30) in the indices i, j, k
all three ﬁelds can be obtained from just one ﬁeld by rotations that map the xi-axes
on one another. From equation (30) we calculate the vector potential A3 in spherical
coordinates x = r sin ϑ cos ϕ, y = r sin ϑ sin ϕ, and z = r cos ϑ. Using unit basis vectors

Let us note that the ﬁelds Bi are highly symmetric and similar. Looking at the
vector potential A3 we observe that it is independent of the variable ϕ, therefore B3
is invariant under rotations leaving the x3-axis ﬁxed. Since the potentials (30) are
cyclic in i, j, k it follows that each Bi ﬁeld is invariant under rotations about the xi
axis. We have pointed out before that a rotation that maps the Euclidian basis vector
ﬁeld e1 to e2 also maps B1 to B2 etc. Furthermore, B3 is similar to the total ﬁeld
B = B1 + B2 + B3 in the following sense: Let R be a rotation that maps the Euclidian
basis vector e3 to the vector √3 R(e3) = e1 + e2 + e3, then B = √3 R(B3).

The magnetic ﬁelds Bi are only of interest for us if their third-order invariant does
not vanish. Explicitly calculating Ai for i = 1, 2, 3 we ﬁnd, using the main Theorem,

The fact that this integral is non-vanishing proves, that the constructed invariant
cannot only be applied to all cases for which we where able to calculate the already

existing invariant, i.e. to three mutually unlinked ﬂux tubes, but also to examples of
triples of ﬁelds not having disjunct support. It is thus a true generalization of the
existing invariant known from the Massey triple product.

As we have pointed out before, H (3) is related to the vacuum winding number

In the general case the cross-helicities of three magnetic ﬁelds, for which we are

Therefore the self-helicities are equal to the value of the third-order invariant. This is
a peculiarity of all magnetic ﬁeld triples derived from an SU (2) Yang-Mills vacuum.
In our analysis of the three example magnetic ﬁelds we now turn our attention to
the topological structure of the ﬁelds and the linkage of individual ﬁeld lines. Figure 4
and 5 show numerically integrated ﬁeld lines, where the starting points for integration
are indicated by the foot points of the arrows that give the ﬁeld line direction. We
observe that all ﬁeld lines are closed and have an elliptical shape. Figures 2 and 3
visualize the toroidal structure of the individual ﬁelds at the example of B3. Using
A3 = A3

∂ϕ A3 = 0 it follows that B3 can be written

Therefore, the ﬁeld lines of B3 lie on ϕ-invariant toroidal surfaces described by
r sin ϑA3
ϕ = const. Figure 2 shows the poloidal B3-ﬁeld and contour lines for three
diﬀerent values of r sin ϑA3

lines on it is drawn in Figure 3. The central ﬁeld line, sitting within all tori is
characterized by B3
In view of the last equation, this is equivalent to
1/3 and ϑ = π/2. We observe that all ﬁeld
∇
lines wind around the central ﬁeld line exactly once. From this and the toroidal
structure of B3 we can conclude that any two arbitrary ﬁeld lines l and l′ of B3 have
a Gauß linkage lk(l, l′) = 1.

Finally let us discuss the linking properties among ﬁeld lines of diﬀerent ﬁelds.
To give an example, one ﬁeld line of each ﬁeld is plotted in Figure 4. The symmetric

appearance is due to the choice of symmetric starting points for the ﬁeld line
integration. As was stressed above, the magnetic ﬁelds Bi can be obtained from
one another by cyclic permutations of the Cartesian coordinates xi. In the same way
the integration starting points for the ﬁeld lines γ1, γ2 and γ3 where chosen to be the
cyclic permuted coordinate triples (0, 0.8, 0), (0, 0, 0.8) and (0.8, 0, 0). It is interesting
that the total linkage of the set of ﬁeld lines is lk(γ1, γ2) + lk(γ2, γ3) + lk(γ3, γ1) =
3.
Even though we have seen that the mutual cross-helicities of all three ﬁelds vanish,

Figure 2.
The vector plot shows the
projection of the B3-ﬁeld onto the x1-
x3-plane. The arrow lengths are not to

Figure 3. The drawn torus is the
surface at which r sin ϑA3
ϕ = −1.8. All
ﬁeld lines of B3 lie on toroidal surfaces

ﬁeld lines lying on this torus are drawn.

Figure 4. The three ﬁeld lines γi
belong to the respective ﬁelds Bi. Their
total linkage is lk(γ1, γ2) + lk(γ2, γ3) +
lk(γ3, γ1) = −3.

Figure 5. For each ﬁeld line γ1 and
γ3 there exists a ﬁeld line ˜γ1 such that
lk(γ1, γ3) + lk(˜γ1, γ3) vanishes.

their individual ﬁeld lines, in general, are linked pairwise. To be more precise: If
we e.g. ﬁx one ﬁeld line γ3 of B3, then all ﬁeld lines of B1 and B2 are either linked
with γ3 exactly once or they intersect γ3 twice. For reasons of symmetry, there exists
for each ﬁeld line γ1 of B1 a ﬁeld line ˜γ1 of B1, such that we ﬁnd the total linkage
lk(γ1, γ3) + lk(˜γ1, γ3) = 0. Hence, the cross-helicity H(B1, γ3) vanishes, which in
turn implies H(B1, B3) = 0. Figure 5 shows such ﬁeld lines γ1, ˜γ1 and γ3 with
0.8, 0) and (0.8, 0, 0) as their respective starting points for the ﬁeld
(0, 0.8, 0), (0,

can obtain ﬁeld lines ˜γ2 and ˜γ3, here with integration starting points (0,
0.8, 0),
(0, 0,
0.8, 0, 0). Together, these three ﬁeld lines yield a conﬁguration
complementary to the one shown in Figure 4, which now has a total linkage of +3.

6. Conclusions

∇ ·

An integral expression has been presented which generalizes the third-order invariant
known from the Massey triple product, to an invariant not limited to mutually unlinked
ﬂux tubes, if the involved ﬁelds allow for potentials that obey
= 0
= j. An example shows that the new invariant H (3) is a true generalization.
for i
In our derivation helicity and H (3) emerge from the same general identity, which
involves the Chern-Simons three-form in the context of an SU (2) gauge symmetry.
Whether this identity leads to further results for other gauge groups has not yet been
investigated, but it is clear that only expressions quadratic and cubic in magnetic ﬂux
can be obtained. The constructed invariant is to be seen as a “cross-linkage” of three
ﬁelds. It still remains to clarify whether or how a total third-order invariant can be
constructed and whether this is possible with the help of a cross third-order linkage
such as in the case of helicity. There might e.g. exist a subdivision of a single ﬁeld
into three components such that the total third-order linkage is determined by the
cross-linkage alone. Unfortunately, the antisymmetry of H (3)(B1, B2, B3) seems to be
one of the key problems for a further generalization analogous to helicity.

Appendix C. Equivalence of the link integrals for disjunct ﬂux tubes

The equivalence of the third-order link integrals as given by Monastyrsky and Sasorov
(1987), Berger (1990) and Ruzmaikin and Akhmetiev (1994) for three disjunct
and mutually unlinked ﬂux tubes Ui with the integral (19) is shown as follows.
Monastyrsky and Sasorov gave an integral which corresponds to the Massey triple
product and reads in vector notation:

The integration is taken over the surface of tube U1. Cyclic permutations of indices
in (C.1) yield equivalent expressions. Note that the Gi in this representation are
Gi = 0 for any gauge. To convert this
evaluated only outside the tubes Ui where
integral into a volume integral over the whole space, one has to evaluate Gi and Fi

on Ui and therefore encounters the problem of
gauge. To overcome this problem Berger deﬁned Gi within the ﬂux tubes as

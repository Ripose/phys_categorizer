Abstract

The existence of the dust acoustic wave (DAW) in a strongly magnetized electron-positron (pair)-

dust plasma is demonstrated. In the DAW, the restoring force comes from the pressure of inertialess

electrons and positrons, and the dust mass provides the inertia. The waves could be of interest

in astrophysical settings such as the supernovae and pulsars, as well as in cluster explosions by

intense laser beams in laboratory plasmas.

INTRODUCTION

The dust acoustic wave (DAW) in an unmagnetized dusty plasma was theoretically pre-

dicted by Rao, Shukla and Yu [1], which revolutionized the ﬁeld of dusty plasma physics.

The phase speed of the DAW is much smaller (larger) than the electron and ion (dust)

thermal speed. The DAW is observed in several laboratory experiments [2, 3, 4, 5]. The

properties of the DAW in a magnetized electron-ion-dust plasma has been discussed in a

textbook [6].

In this paper, we consider the dispersive property of the DAW in a strongly magnetized

pair-dust plasma in which electrons and positrons have equal masses. Such a pair-dust

plasma can occur in supernovae and pulsar environments, as well as in cluster explosions

by intense laser beams in laboratory experiments. In supernovae and around pulsars, the

production of electron–positron pairs is considerable, and the magnetic ﬁeld strengths can
also become appreciable, especially close to the surface of neutron stars (Bsurf ∼ 1010 − 1013

G). These extreme environments are well-known to host large quantities of electron–positron

plasmas, as well as dust particles [7]. Clusters, on the other hand, are laboratory produced

bonded atomic structures, which when irradiated by intense laser ﬁelds form plasmas on a

nano-scale. These plasmas have a life span of the order of femto seconds, after which they

erupt in a release of highly energetic electrons and dust particles [8, 9]. It is expected that

in the next generation of lasers [10] and the free electron lasers which are under develop-

ment (see e.g. [11]) will make it possible to produce electron, positrons and dust particles

due to cluster explosions. Moreover, as the intense laser pulses interact with the plasma,

strong magnetic ﬁelds will be generated, thus creating an environment similar to the one

investigated in this paper.

The frequency (phase speed) of the DAW in our pair-dust plasma is much smaller than

the electron/positron gyrofrequency (electron and positron thermal speeds).

In the dust

acoustic wave potential, both electrons and positrons rapidly thermalize along the magnetic

ﬁeld direction and establish Boltzmann distributions. Thus, pressures of inertialess electrons

and positrons provide the restoring force, whereas the dust mass provides the inertia in order

for the DAW to exist in a magnetized pair-dust plasma. The frequency of the DAW in a pair-

dust magnetoplasma is found to be larger than that in an unmagnetized electron-ion-dust

plasma.

II. FORMULATION

Let consider an electron-positron-dust plasma in an external magnetic ﬁeld B0ˆz, where

B0 is the magnitude of the external magnetic ﬁeld and ˆz is the unit vector along the z

axis. At equilibrium, we have ene0 − qdnd0 = enp0, where e is magnitude of the electron

charge, nj0 is the unperturbed particle number density of the particle species j (j equals e for

electrons, p for positrons, and d for dust grains which have the charge qd; where qd = −eZd

for negatively charged dust grains, qd = eZd for positively charged dust grains, and Zd is the

number of charges on the dust grain surface). The perpendicular (to ˆz) component of the

electron and positron ﬂuid velocities in the presence of low-frequency (in comparison with

ωc = eB0/mc, where m is the electron/positron mass and c is the speed of light in vacuum)

electrostatic ﬁeld E = −∇φ, where φ is the scalar potential, are

which indicate that both electrons and positrons will thermalize rapidly along the magnetic

of the DAW in an electron-positron-dust with that DAW in an unmagnetized electron-ion-

dust plasma. In the latter with Te ≫ Ti and ni0 > ne0, we have λD = λDi ≪ λDe, where
λDi = (Ti/4πni0e2)1/2 is the ion Debye radius. On the other hand, in an electron-positron-ion

plasma, we typically have λD = λDe/(1+σ)1/2, where σ = Tenp0/Tpne0. Thus, the dispersion

properties of the DAW in a magnetized pair-dust plasma are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those

in an unmagnetized electron-ion-dust plasma.

III. SUMMARY

In summary, we have examined the linear property of intermediate frequency, viz. ωcd =

|qd|B0/mdc ≪ ω ≪ ωc, DAW in a strongly magnetized pair-dust plasma. The DAWs are

supported by the pressure of the inertialess electrons and positrons, whereas the mass of the

dust grains provide the inertia.

The results presented in this paper should be of importance in the application of the

next generation lasers to cluster irradiation, and the ensuing cluster explosion. These events

are likely to produce an environment in which pair plasmas, strong magnetic ﬁelds, and

dust particles coexist. Similarly, in supernovae, the pair plasma will inevitably contain dust

particles, and will be interpenetrated by magnetic ﬁelds, thus creating physical conditions

at which the DAW derived in this paper will occur.

On a correspondence between classical and quantum particle systems

Klaus Morawetz
Max-Planck-Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Noethnitzer Str. 38, 01187 Dresden, Germany

An exact correspondence is established between a N -body classical interacting system and a N − 1-
body quantum system with respect to the partition function. The resulting quantum-potential is a
N − 1-body one. Inversely the Kelbg potential is reproduced which describes quantum systems at a
quasi-classical level. The found correspondence between classical and quantum systems allows also
to approximate dense classical many body systems by lower order quantum perturbation theory
replacing Planck’s constant properly by temperature and density dependent expressions. As an
example the dynamical behaviour of an one - component plasma is well reproduced concerning the
formation of correlation energy after a disturbance utilising solely the analytical quantum - Born
result for dense degenerated Fermi systems. As a practical guide the quantum - Bruckner parameter
rs has been replaced by the classical plasma parameter Γ as rs ≈ 0.3Γ3/2.

Several hints in recent literature conjecture that there
seem to exist a correspondence between quantum systems
and higher dimensional classical systems. The authors of
[1] argue that a higher dimensional classical non-Abelian
gauge theory leads to a lower dimensional quantum ﬁeld
theory in the sense of chaotic quantisation. The corre-
spondence has been achieved by equating the tempera-
ture characterising chaotization of the higher dimensional
system with ¯h of the lower dimensional system by

¯h = aT.

(1)

Recalling imaginary time evolution as a method to cal-
culate correlated systems in equilibrium such correspon-
dence seems suggestible. We will ﬁnd a similar relation
(20) but only as a best ﬁt of quantum - Born calculations
to dense interacting classical systems.

In condensed matter physics it is a commonly used
trick to map a two - dimensional classical spin system
onto a one - dimensional quantum system [2]. This sug-
gests that there might exist a general relation between
classical and higher dimensional quantum systems. We
will show that a classical many body system can be
equally described by a quantum system with one particle
less in the system but with the price of complicated non-
local potential. This can be considered analogously to the
Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics [3] where the
Schroedinger equation is rewritten in a Hamilton-Jacobi
equation but with a nonlocal quantum potential.

Another hint towards a correspondence between classi-
cal and quantum systems was found recently in [4] where
it was achieved to deﬁne a Lyapunov exponent in quan-
tum mechanics by employing the marginal distribution
which is a representation of Wigner function in a higher
dimensional space. Since the Lyapunov exponent is es-
sentially a concept borrowed from classical physics this
ﬁnding points also in the direction that there exists a
correspondence between quantum systems and higher di-
mensional classical systems.

On the opposite side there are systematic derivations
of constructing eﬀective classical potentials such that the
many body quantum system is described by the classical
system. An example is the Kelbg potential for Coulomb
systems [5–8]

with l2 = ¯h2/µT and 1/µ = 1/m1 + 1/m2 describing the
two-particle quantum Slater sum correctly by a classical
system. Improvements and systematic applications can
be found in [9–11].

−

Here in this paper it should be shown that a classical
N -particle system can be mapped exactly on a quantum
1-particle system with respect to the partition func-
N
tion. Though the resulting eﬀective N
1 body quantum
potential is highly complex it can lead to practical ap-
plications for approximating strongly correlated classical
systems. In the thermodynamical limit it means that the
dense classical system can be described alternatively by
a quantum system with properly chosen potential.

−

This ﬁnding suggests that the quantum calculation in
lowest order perturbation might be suitable to derive
good approximations for the dense classical system. This
is also motivated by an intuitive picture. Assume we
have a dense interacting classical plasma system. Then
the correlations will restrict the possible phase space for
travelling of one particle considerably like in dense Fermi
systems at low temperatures where the Pauli exclusion
principle restrict the phase space for scattering. There-
fore we might be able to describe a dense interacting
classical system by a perturbative quantum calculation
when properly replacing ¯h by density and temperature
expressions. Indeed we will demonstrate in a one - com-
ponent plasma system that even the time evolution and
dynamics of a very strongly correlated classical system
can be properly approximated by quantum - Born cal-
culations replacing the quantum parameters by proper

sical and quantum systems by rewriting the classical N-

where we rewrote Meyer’s cluster graphs in terms of the
classical potential u. The resulting equivalent quantum
1-body nonlocal potential with
potential (9) is a N
respect to the coordinates but depends on N strength
function parameter (e.g. charges). Therefore we have
casted a classical N -body problem into a nonlocal quan-
1 body problem. One could easily give also a
tum N
symmetrised or anti-symmetrised form of the potential
using symmetries of the wave function and permuting
coordinates of (9) respectively. We do not need it here
since we will restrict to applications neglecting exchange
correlations further on.

−

While the above correspondence holds for any particle
number and might be useful to ﬁnd solvable models for
classical three - body problems, we will consider in the
following many - body systems. First let us invert the
problem and search for an eﬀective classical potential ap-
proximating quantum systems. This should us lead to the
known Kelbg-potential (2). For this purpose we assume
a quantum system described in lowest approximation by
a Slater determinant or a complete factorisation of the
many - body wave function into single wave function
Ψi1...iN (x1...xN ) = φi1 ...φiN . We neglect for simplicity
exchange correlations in the following. The correspond-
ing eigenvalue equation for φ itself one can obtain from
(6) or (8) by multiplying with Ψ∗
i2..iN −1(x2...xN −1) and
integrate over x2...xN −1. To see the generic structure
more clearly we better calculate the correlation energy
by multiplying (6) or (8) by Ψ∗
i2..iN −1i1 (x2...xN ) and in-
tegrating over x2...xN . This provides also the eigenvalue
ǫ{i} and leads easily to approximations for the partition
function (3). To demonstrate this we choose the lowest
order approximation taking identical plane waves for φ.
Than the pressure can be obtained from the partition
function QN via (7)

where V is the volume of the system. We recognise
the standard second virial coeﬃcient for small potentials
while for higher order potential the factor 1/2 appears in
the exponent instead as a pre-factor indicating a diﬀerent
partial summation of diagrams due to the schema behind
(7) and (8).

To go beyond the plane wave approximation we multi-
ply (6) by Ψ∗
i2..iN −1i1 (x2...xN ) and the kinetic part of the
statistical operator before integrating over x2...xN . This
means we create an integral over the N

sity operator and the potential (9) which together repre-
sents the correlation energy. This expression is a succes-

With the schema (13) one can easily integrate higher or-
der approximations as successive convolutions. Also in
principle the degenerate case could be calculated using
Fermi-Dirac distributions in (14). But one should then
consider also the neglected exchange correlations during
factorisation of Ψ as well. Let us summarise that the
known eﬀective classical potential describing a quantum
system in binary approximation has been recovered by
identifying the eﬀective two-particle interaction within
the correlation energy.

We want now to proceed to a phenomenological level
in that the above correspondence between quantum and
classical systems motivates to ﬁnd good approximations
for the dynamics of classical many - body systems by
employing quantum - Born approximations and replacing
¯h properly.

Let us consider an one-component plasma system
which is characterised by two values. The classical cou-
pling is described by the plasma parameter Γ = e
dT as a
ratio of the length where Coulomb energy becomes larger
than kinetic energy, e
T , to the interparticle distance or
Wigner size radius d = ( 3
4πn )1/3. Ideal plasmas are found
for Γ << 1 while around Γ = 1 non-ideal eﬀects become
important. A second parameter which controls the quan-
tum features is the Bruckner parameter as the ratio of
the Wigner size radius to the Bohr radius aB = ¯h2/me2.

Quantum eﬀects will play a role if rs ≤
sider the situation that the interaction of such system
is switched on at initial time. Then the correlations are
formed by the system which is seen in an increase of
temperature accompanied by the build up of negative
correlation energy. This theoretical experiment has been
investigated numerically by [12] for classical plasmas with
diﬀerent plasma parameter Γ. In [13,14] we have calcu-
lated the formation of such correlations by using quan-
tum kinetic equations in Born approximation. The time
dependence of kinetic energy was found at short times to

low temperature limit. For both cases dynamical as well
as statical screening it was possible to integrate analyt-
ically the time dependent correlation energy (16). This
has allowed to describe the time dependence of simula-
tions in the weak coupling limit Γ < 1 appropriately [13].

Now we will employ the ideas developed above and will
use the quantum Born approximations in the strongly
degenerated case to describe the classical strongly corre-
lated system. For strongly degenerated plasmas the time
dependence of correlation energy was possible to inte-
grate as well with the result [14] expressed here in terms
of plasma parameter Γ and quantum Bruckner parameter

FIG. 1. The time evolution of a classical one-component
plasma after sudden switching of interaction [12] compared
to the quantum Born result when the Bruckner parameter is
replaced according to (18). The long time equilibrium value is
remarkably well reproduced by the quantum - Born result(17).

Let us try to understand what this phenomenological
ﬁnding means. Deﬁning the thermal De Broglie wave
length as λ2 = ¯h2/4mT we can rewrite (18) as

which shows remarkably the structure of the result (1)
in literature. But here it is only a best ﬁt to reproduce
dense classical results by simpler quantum Born approx-
imations and bears no fundamental importance.

We summarise that it is indeed possible to ﬁnd a good
approximation of classical dense interacting systems by
quantum Born calculations replacing the quantum pa-
rameter properly by classical ones. For equilibrium we
have shown that there exist an exact relation between a
1-body quantum sys-
N -body classical system and a N
tem. This has allowed to recover the quantum Kelbg po-
tential easily. We conjecture that a similar relation like
in equilibrium between classical N -body and quantum
1 body system might exist also for nonequilibrium.

As practical consequence we suggest to describe dense
interacting classical many body systems by the simpler
perturbative quantum calculation in degenerate limit re-
placing properly ¯h by typical classical parameters of the
system.

ABSTRACT

Is it possible to create a small volume of equilibrium pair plasma in the laboratory with an
intense laser pulse? No. The required power would exceed 1018 W. The number of seed particles
required to absorb the laser energy would approach the number of pairs in the desired plasma,
and their radiation in a visible laser ﬁeld would occur at excessively high frequencies.

Introduction

Space in thermal equilibrium at suﬃciently high temperature is ﬁlled with an electron-positron pair
plasma. If there are no baryons present the equilibrium densities of electrons and positrons are equal and
are given by

where m is the electron’s mass and other symbols have their usual meanings (Landau & Lifschitz 1958). If

A pair plasma with this density is in complete thermodynamic equilibrium with the photon gas into which
it annihilates and from which it is formed by pair production, and each species has zero chemical potential.
The radiation ﬁeld has a Planckian spectrum at temperature T .

It is necessary to distinguish this pair plasma in equilibrium with a black body radiation ﬁeld from

the much lower density pair plasmas frequently considered in astrophysics. These low density pair plasmas
may have equilibrium relativistic Maxwellian particle distribution functions, but their densities are lower,
usually by many orders of magnitude, than would be given by Eq. 1. Their chemical potentials are negative
and many times mc2 in magnitude. They are not in equilibrium with a Planckian radiation ﬁeld. Their
optical depth is generally very low, and the radiation energy density is much less than that of the pairs.
Such low density pair plasmas have been considered by many authors in many astrophysical contexts, but
will not be discussed further here.

Completely equilibrium pair plasmas occur (with the addition of baryons and a consequent shift in

chemical potential and inequality between n− and n+) in the interior of very evolved stars, where they are
hidden from view. Equilibrium pair plasmas have also been considered (Thompson & Duncan 1995, Katz
1996) as sources of emission from soft gamma repeaters (SGR), if trapped within the strong magnetic ﬁeld
of a neutron star. The minimum required magnetic ﬁeld is only ∼ 1011 gauss, although much stronger ﬁelds

have been considered. Directly observed pair plasma would be expected to produce an approximately black
body radiation spectrum, whose temperature is only weakly dependent on the many unknown astrophysical
parameters. This is in at least qualitative agreement with observations of SGR, whose spectra appear to be
strongly self-absorbed at low frequencies, to be characterized by temperatures roughly comparable to those
predicted by pair plasma models, and which are nearly uniform from burst to burst and within bursts. In
addition, an equilibrium pair plasma is such a simple state of matter, which occurs whenever the energy
density is suﬃcient and the optical depth large, that it may be found in unanticipated places in the universe
and is likely to repay study.

2. Equilibrium Pair Plasmas in the Laboratory?

2.1. Energetics

The advent of high power lasers, now including the Petawatt (1015 W) laser, raises the question of
whether it might be possible to create a small volume of equilibrium pair plasma in the laboratory. The
ﬁrst criterion which must be satisﬁed is energetic: Can a laser supply the power lost from the surface of the
plasma?

There are two mechanisms of energy loss. The surface will radiate approximately as a black body at its
temperature, and the pairs themselves will expand freely (in contrast to the situation near a neutron star,
the magnetic ﬁeld required to conﬁne the pairs is unachievable in the laboratory). It is easy to see that
the second process is less important than the ﬁrst, partly because the pairs escape at a slower speed than
photons, and partly because the equilibrium pair energy density is always less than 7/4 that of photons
at the same temperature, and is less by an exponentially large factor if kBT ≪ mc2, the case of interest,
because of the exponential in Eq. 2. We will therefore only consider energy loss by radiation.

The minimum temperature required to obtain an equilibrium pair plasma may be estimated by
requiring that the Thomson scattering optical depth be at least 3, in order that photon-pair equilibrium be
achieved. Assume a spherical plasma of radius r = 0.6 µ, which has a volume of nearly a cubic micron. This
size is chosen because it is approximately the size of a diﬀraction-limited focal spot of a visible laser. Then
the required pair density, allowing for the presence of both species, is

n± =

3
2σesr

≈ 4 × 1028 cm−3.

This is probably an underestimate of the actual required density because of the decrease of cross-section
with increasing energy and the incomplete equilibration achieved in Compton scattering in contrast to
absorption.

The required temperature may be found from Eqs. 3 and 4, with the result T = 2.3 × 109 ◦K and the

parameter

This power need be radiated only for a time O(r/c) ∼ 2 × 10−15 s, so the required energy is only ∼ 15 kJ.
However, such brief illumination would require a laser of a bandwidth far broader than any known today.

These numbers are intimidating. The power exceeds that of the Petawatt laser by nearly four orders of
magnitude. While this would not violate any fundamental physical bound, it is certainly beyond anything
achievable within forseeable budgets and with forseeable technology.

Larger volumes of pair plasma would require even more power. First suppose n± ∝ T 3, as is the
case for kBT ≫ mc2. Then the temperature required (by the condition that the optical depth equal 3)
1/3
± ∝ r−1/3. The radiated power P ∝ T 4r2 ∝ r2/3 increases as r increases. In fact, in the applicable
T ∝ n
regime kBT ≪ mc2 the decrease of T with decreasing n± and increasing r is slower (the sensitivity of n±
to T is greater, because of the exponential in Eq. 2), and the dependence of P on r approaches the second
power. It is clear that increasing r only increases the required power.

Values of r signiﬁcantly less than 0.6 µ are excluded, so long as power is provided by a laser of
near-visible wavelength, by the diﬀraction limit on focal spot size. However, even if much smaller r could be
obtained the required power would not be much less. The reason for this is that values of r less than a few
tenths of a micron imply kBT > mc2, and the Thomson cross-section must be replaced by the Klein-Nishina
cross-section, which decreases approximately ∝ T −1. Taking n± ∝ T 3 yields r ∝ T −2 and P ∝ T 4r2,
independent of T and r.

2.2. Kinetics

Suppose that, somehow, visible lasers of the required power were available. The implied electric and

magnetic ﬁelds would be impressive, with amplitudes

These should be compared to the characteristic quantum ﬁelds at which Landau levels are spaced by mc2

where α ≡ e2/¯hc is the usual ﬁne-structure constant.

We now ignore the possibility of spontaneous pair production, and consider only the eﬀects of such

large ﬁelds on an injected electron or a small number of pairs. Will their motion lead to rapid radiation of
the soft gamma-rays which can create the desired equilibrium pair plasma? We consider only the radiation
by individual particles in intense ﬁelds, and also ignore such processes as inverse bremsstrahlung, which are
generally slow at high energies and low densities.

The theory of the motion of a charged particle in a strong electromagnetic wave was recently reviewed
by Meyerhofer 1997, and many useful results are presented by Gunn & Ostriker 1971. I will apply results
which assume a plane space-ﬁlling electromagnetic wave. In fact, these results overestimate by a very large
factor the energy absorbed in a small laser focal spot by charged particles which soon leave the region of
high intensity.

The radiation parameter is much larger than that found for pulsar ﬁelds, for which ǫ ≪ 1, but is small
enough that the results of Gunn & Ostriker 1971 are still approximately valid. The mean power radiated
per electron (or positron) in the laser ﬁeld is given by Gunn & Ostriker 1971, in a process which they name
nonlinear inverse Compton scattering,

Approximately 6 × 1016 electrons and positrons must be present to absorb the power required (Eq. 6). This
is approximately equal to the 8 × 1016 particles present in a cubic micron of equilibrium pair plasma (Eq.
3). In other words, the laser could sustain the plasma once it was created, but could not produce it from a
much smaller number of seed particles by nonlinear inverse Compton scattering.

Gunn & Ostriker 1971 also estimate the critical frequency νcrit of nonlinear inverse Compton scattering
for a very energetic particle (Lorentz factor ≫ ηmc2) entering the laser ﬁeld. Their argument may also be
applied to particles accelerated by the laser ﬁeld itself, with similar results:

where the parameter w ≡ ¯hω/mc2.

These are photons of ∼ 1011 eV energy. Their cross-section for photon-photon pair production is very
small, and they are produced (because of their high energy) in very small numbers even if suﬃcient charged
particles were present to absorb the required power. If produced they will escape, rather than producing an
equilibrium pair plasma.

3. Discussion

It is apparent that near-visible lasers cannot be used to produce an equilibrium pair plasma, even if

suﬃcient power were available. This goal requires not only extremely high power (Eq. 6) but also that this
power be delivered in photons of energy approaching mc2 (Eq. 12). Until gamma-ray lasers are developed,
this is likely to remain unachievable.

Introduction

Magnetic ﬁelds B ∼ 1012−1013 G typical of isolated neutron stars qualitatively modify many
physical properties of matter [1, 2]. It was suggested that the outer layers of the neutron
stars may be composed of hydrogen at temperatures T ∼ 105.5 − 106.5 K [3]. Thus the study
of hydrogen plasmas at such B and T is of great practical importance for astrophysics. For
studying the magnetized matter, Thomas-Fermi-like methods were used starting from 1970
[4] (see ref. [5] for recent results and references). It is well known, however, that they are
not well suited for light elements. Here we employ the free-energy minimization method.

The motion of charged particles in a magnetic ﬁeld is quantized into Landau orbitals.
The magnetic ﬁeld is called strongly quantizing if the free electrons populate mostly the
ground Landau level [2]. This occurs when the electron cyclotron energy ~ωc = ~eB/(mec)
(where ~, e, me and c are the Planck constant, electron charge, electron mass and speed of
light, respectively) exceeds both the thermal energy kBT and the electron Fermi energy ǫF
— that is for temperatures T ≪ TB and densities ρ < ρB, where

TB = 3.16 × 105 γ K,

ρB = 0.809 γ3/2 g cm−3,

The atom in a strong magnetic ﬁeld γ ≫ 1 is compressed in the transverse directions to
the size of the “magnetic length”: am = (~c/eB)1/2 = a0 γ−1/2, where a0 = ~2/(mee2)
is the Bohr radius. The ground-state binding energy grows logarithmically with B and
exceeds the ground-state energy of the ﬁeld-free atom by order of magnitude at B ∼ 1012 G
[1].
Ionization equilibrium of atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds has been ﬁrst discussed in
ref. [6]. However, that pioneering work neglected modiﬁcations of the atomic properties
caused by the thermal motion of the atoms across the ﬁeld. These motional modiﬁcations
arise from the coupling between the centre-of-mass motion across the ﬁeld and the relative
electron-proton motion. These eﬀects were appreciated by Ventura et al. [7], but quantum-
mechanical calculations of binding energies and wave functions of hydrogen atoms in any
states of motion in the strong magnetic ﬁelds have been carried out only recently [8].

Lai and Salpeter [9] (see references therein for earlier work) considered the ionization
equilibrium of strongly magnetized hydrogen using a crude approximation for binding ener-
gies of moving atoms which missed the so-called decentred states with a large electron-proton
separation [8]. The same approximation was used in ref. [10], devoted to the low-density
equation of state. Here we employ new ﬁtting formulae to atomic energies and sizes [11]
based on the previous study [8], valid for any state of atomic motion. We construct an
analytic model of the plasma free energy and derive and solve a generalized Saha equation.

2 Free Energy Model and Generalized Saha Equation

We consider a plasma consisting of Ne electrons, Np = Ne protons, and NH hydrogen
atoms in a volume V , and write the Helmholtz free energy as F = Fid + Fex, where Fid =
id + F (p)
F (e)
is the sum of the ideal-gas free energies of the electrons, protons, and
neutral species, respectively, and Fex is the excess free energy.

In the strongly quantizing regime, the Fermi energy is ǫF = 2π4~2 (a2

diﬀers from the non-magnetic case by a factor (4/3)2/3(ρ/ρB)4/3. Thus the degeneracy is
strongly reduced at ρ ≪ ρB. Furthermore, in the non-degenerate regime (kBT ≫ ǫF ), we

The contribution of atoms in the nonideal part Fex of the free energy is calculated in
the hard-sphere approximation using the van der Waals one-ﬂuid model by analogy with
ref. [14].
Its straightforward generalization to the magnetic case involves the composite
quantum number κ = (sνK⊥), so that Σκ includes now integration over K⊥. The hard-
sphere diameters are set equal to the eﬀective atomic sizes lκ given in [11]. The occupation
probabilities are then given by formulae derived in ref. [14], extended to the magnetic case.
Our model is valid as long as the formation of molecules may be neglected. In order to
quantify the range of validity, we estimate the abundance of H2 molecules following ref. [9],
but with inclusion of the non-ideal eﬀects.

3 Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows selected results obtained for B = 1012 G. The left panel shows the neutral
fraction of atoms fH = NH /N0 and molecules fH2 = 2NH2/N0 at T = 106 K. For com-
parison, we plot the fraction of atoms in the centred states, fH according to ref. [9] and
fH in the non-magnetic case. Long dashes display the fraction of atoms that satisfy the
Inglis–Teller (IT) criterion and thus can be identiﬁed in optical spectra of the plasma. The
κ ∼ nκ exp[−np(4lκ)3] (cf. Eq. (31) of
IT fraction is estimated according to the formula nIT
ref. [14]). We can see that (a) the strong magnetic ﬁeld increases the non-ionized fraction
and shifts the region of pressure ionization to much higher ρ (compare the solid line and
triangles in the left panel of Fig. 1), (b) the approximation of ref. [9] reproduces only the
abundance of the centred atoms at low density and fails at high density where the pressure-
ionization eﬀects are important, and (c) at the low density, the decentred atomic states are
signiﬁcantly populated.

The right panel demonstrates the equation of state, which is seen to be much softer than
(a) in the non-magnetic case (mainly because of the electron degeneracy “taken away” by
the strongly quantizing ﬁeld, but also due to the increased neutral fraction) and (b) in the
magnetic but ideal proton-electron plasma (because the Coulomb interactions yield negative
contribution to the pressure).

The obtained results are used for modelling neutron-star atmospheres.

In particular,
the IT fraction of atoms, multiplied by the absorption cross sections calculated in ref. [15],
determines an atomic contribution to atmospheric opacities. Preliminary calculations of
the opacities, carried out with a simpliﬁed Fex, were presented in ref. [16]. The more
elaborated model of the plasma described here conﬁrms qualitative results of that work. An
important conclusion is that the bound species contribute signiﬁcantly to the absorption at
B = 1012 − 1013 G, even at relatively high T ∼ 106 K.

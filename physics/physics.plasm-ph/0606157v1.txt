Abstract

The appearance of the chaotic synchronization regimes has been discovered for the

coupled spatially extended beam-plasma Pierce systems. The coupling was intro-

duced only on the right bound of each subsystem. It has been shown that with

coupling increase the spatially extended beam-plasma systems show the transition

from asynchronous behavior to the phase synchronization and then to the com-

plete synchronization regime. For the consideration of the chaotic synchronization

we used the concept of time scale synchronization described in work [Chaos, 14,

3 (2004) 603–610] and based on the introduction of the continuous set of phases

of chaotic signal. In case of unidirectional coupling the generalized synchronization

regime has been observed in the spatially extended beam-plasma systems. The gen-

eralized synchronization appearance mechanism has been analyzed by means of the

oﬀered modiﬁed system approach [Phys. Rev. E, 71, 6 (2005) 067201].

Introduction

The analysis of the chaotic synchronization phenomenon in various nature sys-

tems becomes an area of active research of nonlinear science [1–4]. The chaotic

synchronization regime has been observed in a whole series of coupled physi-

cal, biological, physiological, chemical and other systems [1, 4–7]. At present,

several diﬀerent types of chaotic synchronization are known such as general-

ized synchronization [8], phase synchronization [4,9], lag synchronization [10],

intermittent lag [11] and intermittent generalized [12] synchronization be-

haviour, noise-induced synchronization [13], complete synchronization [14] and

time scale synchronization [15,16], which generalizes the above-listed types of

chaotic synchronization [15,17,18]. The various methods of analysis should be

used to detect the diﬀerent synchronization regimes [9, 10, 15, 16, 19–21].

The presence of the generalized synchronization [8] means that there is a func-

tional relation x2(t) = F[x1(t)] between the response x2(t) and drive x1(t)

chaotic systems states after the transient is ﬁnished. The phase synchroniza-

tion [4, 9, 21] means that phase locking of chaotic signals occurs, while this

signal amplitudes may remain uncoupled and look chaotic. The regime of cou-

pled oscillations called the lag-synchronization regime, if the dynamics of each

subsystem occurs with some shift in time τ : x1(t)

x2(t). In our works [15, 17] it was shown that generalized, phase,

≈

lag- and complete synchronization are closely related with each other and

may be considered as the particular cases of the same type of synchronized

oscillations which was called time scale synchronization. The character of the

synchronized regime (phase, generalized, lag- or complete synchronization) is

determined by the quantity of synchronized time scales, which are introduced

by the continuous wavelet transform [22–24]. Since the time scale s is bound

up with frequency, synchronization of chaotic oscillations is connected with

appearance of the phase coupling between spectral components ω of Fourier–

spectra S(ω) [16].

Most research dealing with chaotic synchronization were realized for the sys-

tems with low number of degrees of freedom [2–4, 14] and for the sample

models of spatially extended systems (chains and networks of coupled non-

linear chaotic oscillators [3, 25–27], coupled Ginsburg-Landau [3, 28, 29] and

Kuramoto-Sivashinsky [30] equations and others). The study of chaotic syn-

chronization in the spatially extended systems was experimentally an theoret-

ically carried out for the nonlinear optical [31–33] and chemical [34] systems

and for the low-frequency oscillations in plasma discharge tubes [35,36]. It was

shown that while introducing the unidirectional or symmetric coupling in the

distributed systems they demonstrate the various types of chaotic synchro-

nization, namely the complete, lag and generalized synchronization. However,

the chaotic synchronization in the locally coupled microwave beam-plasma

systems is not examined in detail by now. Besides, the transition between

various synchronization types are not well investigated and obvious analogies

between chaotic synchronization in the spatially extended and low-dimensional

systems are not formulated. At the same time research of chaotic synchroniza-

3

tion regimes in spatially extended beam-plasma microwave systems seems to

be important because of its applications dealing with data transmission [37–40]

and control of chaotic oscillations in microwave electronics systems (see, for

example, [41]).

The present paper deals with research of chaotic synchronization in coupled

beam-plasma microwave systems with overcritical current — Pierce diode ﬂuid

models [42–44], which seems to be interesting as an important model of beam-

plasma systems showing various types of chaotic behavior [43–48].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 the ﬂuid model of Pierce diode

is brieﬂy discussed. In Section 2 the complete synchronization and time scale

synchronization of mutual coupled beam-plasma systems are described. In

Section 3 we discuss the generalized synchronization regime in unidirectionally

coupled spatially extended beam-plasma systems and describe the method

of modiﬁed system [49] applied to the discussed model. In conclusion, we

summarise the main results discussed in our paper.

1 General formalism

Pierce diode [42–44] is one of the simple spatially extended beam-plasma sys-

tems demonstrating chaotic dynamics [43–46,48,50]. It consists of two inﬁnite

parallel plains pierced by a mono-energetic electron beam (Fig. 1). Grids are

grounded and the distance between them is L. Charge density ρ0 and electron

velocity v0 are maintained constant at the system input. The region between

two plains is evenly ﬁlled by neutralizing stationary ions, whose density

ρi

is

|

|

equal to the non-perturbed beam electron density

ρ0

.

|

|

4

The only one dimensionless control parameter of this system is Pierce param-

eter

α = ωpL/v0

, where ωp is the electron beam plasma frequency, v0 is the non-perturbed

electron velocity, L is the distance between diode plains. This distributed

model, though rather simple, demonstrates many features of the electron beam

dynamics in diﬀerent real electron devices such as virtual cathode oscillators

(vircators) [51, 52]. With α > π, the so-called Pierce instability develops in

the system and the virtual cathode is formed in the electron beam [42,44]. At

the same time in a narrow range of Pierce parameter values near α

3π the

∼

increase of the instability is suppressed by the non-linearity and in the electron

beam the regime without reﬂection takes place [44,52]. In this case the system

may be described by ﬂuid equations [43,44,52]. It is known [43–46,48] that in

this regime various types of beam-plasma chaotic oscillations occur.

Dynamics of two coupled Pierce diodes in ﬂuid electronic approximation is

described by the self-congruent system of dimensionless Poisson, continuity

and motion equations:

In the present paper we study both mutual and unidirectional coupling be-

tween Pierce diodes. Mutual coupling between systems is realized by the mod-

ulation of dimensionless potential value on the right bounds of both systems:

ary conditions, which describe mutual (6) and unidirectional (7) coupling, and

values ρ1,2(x = 1.0, t) present oscillations of non-dimensional density of spa-

tial charge, which are registered at the output of the both systems. It may be

carried out experimentally by putting a cutoﬀ of a spiral slow wave system

at the output of diode space [53], which register oscillations of electron beam

charge density.

System of partial diﬀerential equations (1)—(3) has been integrated numeri-

cally using ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation. Numerical solutions for continuity

(2) and motion (3) equations have been found by means of explicit scheme

with diﬀerences against ﬂow, and Poisson equation (1) has been integrated

using error vector propagation method [54]. The time and space integration

steps have been selected as ∆x = 0.005 and ∆t = 0.003.

It is well known [43–46, 48], that in the autonomous ﬂuid model the transi-

tion to chaotic spatiotemporal dynamics of spatial charge is observed via cas-

cade of period doubling bifurcations with α parameter decrease in the range

α

(2.85π, 2.87π). This is shown in Fig. 2. where space charge density oscil-

from Fig. 2 that with Pierce parameter α decrease the oscillation complexity

increases on average.

2 Complete and time scale synchronization in mutual coupled dis-

tributed chaotic systems

Let us consider the dynamics of the coupled Pierce diode model (1)—(3) with

mutual coupling (6) for the ﬁxed Pierce parameter value of the ﬁrst system

α1 = 2.861π and changing the control parameter α2 of the second system in

8

of parameters.

(2.85π, 2.87π). The chaotic dynamics is observed in this range

Numerical simulation showed that time scale synchronization may be observed

for the small detuning between spatially extended chaotic systems ∆α = α1

−
α2. The appearance of the time scale synchronization regime is determined

by the analysis of phase diﬀerence dynamics on the various time scales s.

A continuous set of phases φs(t) of chaotic time series was introduced with

the help of the continuous wavelet transform [16–18]. Chaotic oscillations of

spatial charge density ρ1,2(t) at the point x = 0.2 of interaction space were

examined as an analyzed time series.

The main idea of the time scale synchronization [15–18] is in the following.

Let us consider a continuous wavelet transform of time series ξ(t)

(8)

W (s, t0) =

ξ(t)ψ∗

s,t0(t) dt,

+∞

Z−∞

where

ψs,t0(t) =

√s

ψ0

t

−
s (cid:19)

(cid:18)

is the wavelet-function related to the mother-wavelet ψ0(t). The time scale

s corresponds to the width of the wavelet function ψs,t0(t), t0 is the shift of

wavelet along the time axis (“
∗

” denotes complex conjugation) [22, 24]. It

should be noted that the time scale is usually used instead of the frequency

of the Fourier transform and can be considered as the quantity inversed to it.

The Morlet wavelet [55]

ψ0(η) = (1/ 4√π) exp(jω0η) exp

η2/2

(cid:17)

−
(cid:16)

has been used as a mother-wavelet function. The choice of parameter value

9

ω0 = 2π provides the relation s = 1/f between the time scale s of wavelet

transform and frequency f of Fourier transform.

The wavelet surface

W (s, t0) =

W (s, t0)

exp[jφs(t0)]

|

|

describes the system dynamics on every time scale s at the moment of time t0.

The value of

W (s, t0)

indicates the presence and intensity of the time scale

|

|

s at the moment of time t0. It is also possible to consider the quantity

E(s)

|

which is the distribution of integral energy over time scales. At the same time,

the phase φs(t) = arg W (s, t) is naturally introduced for every time scale s.

In other words, it is possible to describe the behavior of each time scale s by

means of its own phase φs(t).

If there is a range of time scales [sm; sb], for which the phase locking condition

is satisﬁed and the part of the wavelet spectrum energy (10) in this range

then we assert that time scale synchronization between oscillators takes place

[15, 17]. In the condition (11) φs1,2(t) are continuous phases of the ﬁrst and

the second systems which correspond to the synchronized time scales s.

Introducing a continuous set of time scales s and the instantaneous phases

associated with them, as well as separation of the range of synchronous time

scales ∆s = s2

s1 allows us to inject the quantitative performance of a

−

measure of chaotic synchronization of coupled systems. This measure γ can

be deﬁned as a part of wavelet spectrum energy falling on the synchronized

time scales:

is the distribution of integral energy over time scales, which is de-

termined by relation (10). This measure γ is equal to zero for non-synchronized

oscillations, γ

= 0 means that in the coupled systems the conditions of time-

scale synchronization (11) and (12) are implemented. The value γ

1 shows,

≈

that oscillations in each of subsystems are identical or close to each other.

Such regime is called the complete synchronization regime. Growth of γ value

from 0 up to 1 testiﬁes the increase of a part of the wavelet spectrum energy,

falling on the synchronous time scales s.

Let us revert to examination of mutual oscillations in the system of Pierce

diode ﬂuid models.

The behavior of coupled beam-plasma systems is illustrated by Fig. 3a, plotted

for α1 = 2.861π and α2 = 2.860π, on which the change of the synchronous time

scales range sm and sb is shown during an increase of the coupling parameter

ε. From Fig. 3a one can see, that for ε > 0.0007 the synchronous time scales

exist. This regime, as it was discussed above, corresponds to the time-scale

synchronization. The range of synchronous scales increases while increasing

coupling parameter ε. For ε

system tends to demonstrate the complete chaotic synchronization regime,

which is characterized by close to identical dynamics of each of the coupled

systems (τ

When greater detuning of coupled beam-plasma system parameters ∆α oc-

curs, the spectral distribution of oscillations in electron beam becomes essen-

tially more complicated and the appearance of time scale synchronization is

observed for the larger values of coupling strength. In Fig. 3a for the case

of α1 = 2.860π and α2 = 2.858π the corresponding boundaries [sm, sb] of

the synchronous time scales area are shown. Similar to the described above,

with ε parameter increase the range of synchronous time scales appears and

the system tends to show the complete synchronization regime. However, it

occurs under essentially greater values of coupling parameters rather than it

was observed in case of small detuning. To analyze the degree of vicinity the

The results are shown in Fig. 3b (curves 1,2), from which one can see that

function ∆(ε) decreases quickly tending to zero with the coupling parameter

increase. From Fig. 3b (

) one can see that the value ∆, for the large parameter

detuning remains unequal to zero (although it becomes suﬃciently small for

ε > 0.17) apart from the case of small detuning (Fig. 3b ((cid:4))). Oscillation

synchronization regime.

As it was noted above, the synchronization measure γ (13) is an important

energetic characteristic of the synchronous behavior of coupled spatially ex-

ary of the complete synchronization regime is shown

tended chaotic systems. In Fig. 3b (curves 3,4) the dependencies γ(ε) are shown

for the sets of control parameters α1,2 mentioned above. It is easy to see that

the increment of a part of chaotic spatiotemporal oscillation energy falling on

the synchronous time scales takes place with the coupling parameter increase.

It corresponds to the convergence of oscillations in each of spatially extended

systems and, as a result, to the appearance (for the greater values of coupling

parameter) of the complete synchronization regime.

In Fig. 4 the boundary of complete synchronization area plotted for ﬁxed value

of Pierce parameter α1 = 2.861π is shown on the control parameter plane

(α2, ε). From the ﬁgure one can see that the complete synchronization regime

takes place with the coupling parameter increase for all detunings of control

parameters α1,2 of either Pierce diode. It is fair both for the weak chaotic

oscillations and small parameter detuning and for developed chaos even for

14

great detuning between control parameters of each subsystem. The minimal

values of coupling parameter ε, for which the complete synchronization in

spatially extended beam-plasma systems is observed, have been detected for

the small detuning of coupled subsystems.

3 Generalized synchronization in unidirectionaly coupled Pierce

diodes

Let us examine the generalized synchronization phenomenon in the consid-

ered coupled spatially extended systems. The generalized synchronization has

been introduced only for the unidirectionaly coupled systems, therefore let

us consider the unidirectional coupling (7) between spatially extended Pierce

beam-plasma systems being in the chaotic oscillations regime.

We used auxiliary system approach [20] and the highest conditional Lyapunov

exponent calculating [19, 56] for the generalized synchronization regime diag-

nostic . The main idea of the auxiliary system approach is that along with the

response system xr(t) another (auxiliary) system being identical to it, xa(t),

is examined. Initial conditions for the auxiliary system xa(t0) have to be cho-

sen diﬀerent from the response system initial state xr(t0) but they should

belong to the same chaotic attractor. In the case of lack of the generalized

synchronization regime between interacting systems the state vectors of re-

sponse xr(t) and auxiliary xa(t) systems are diﬀerent. And in the case of the

generalized synchronization regime presence, the states of the response and

auxiliary systems must be identical xr(t)

xa(t) after the transient in order

to fulﬁll relations: xr(t) = F[xd(t)] and, correspondingly, xa(t) = F[xd(t)].

Thus, the equivalence of the response and auxiliary systems states after the

≡

|

(values

of spatial charge density) between the response and drive systems. (a) ε = 0.05, the

lack of the generalized synchronization regime, (b) ε = 0.2, the chaotic generalized

synchronization regime: after transient is ﬁnished in the response and drive systems

the same spatiotemporal states appear

transient (which may be suﬃciently long [12]) is a criterion of the generalized

synchronization regime presence between the drive and response oscillators.

Analysis of the generalized synchronization regime also may be realized by

means of the conditional Lyapunov exponent calculating [57]. In this case

Lyapunov exponents are calculated for the non-autonomous response system,

and since the behavior of this system depends on the drive system behavior

these Lyapunov exponents are called conditional. Negativity of the largest con-

ditional Lyapunov exponent λ is a criterion of the generalized synchronization

presence in unidirectionally coupled dynamical systems [19, 56].

While using auxiliary system approach the system of equations (1)—(3) has

been solved for the auxiliary system Pierce parameter value being equal to

16

Fig. 6. Dependence of the highest conditional Lyapunov exponent on the coupling

parameter ε for the values of Pierce parameter of the drive and response systems:

α1 = 2.858π and α2 = 2.862π. The value of the coupling parameter for which the

generalized synchronization regime appears in the system (the largest conditional

Lyapunov exponent becomes negative) is marked by an arrow

the response system control parameter, but with diﬀerent initial conditions.

It is useful for the generalized synchronization regime diagnostics to plot the

oscillation diﬀerence

ρa(x, t)

between the response (ρ2(x, t)) and

|
auxiliary (ρa(x, t)) system over all interaction space. Results are presented

−

|

in Fig. 5, from which one can see that the charge density oscillations in the

response and auxiliary systems remain diﬀerent over all interaction space for

smaller values of coupling parameter (Fig. 5a), and for the suﬃciently large

values of ε oscillations in the response and auxiliary systems become identical

(Fig. 5b), i.e. the generalized synchronization regime appears in the coupled

system.

Results obtained by using auxiliary system approach has been conﬁrmed by

means of the highest conditional Lyapunov exponent λ calculating. Numerical

17

Fig. 7. Dependence of generalized synchronization threshold εGS on the control

parameter of the drive α2 (ﬁg. a) and response α1 (ﬁg. b) distributed systems

calculation of the highest conditional Lyapunov exponent, as above, has been

realized by Benetdin’s algorithm adapted for distributed system analysis. In

Fig. 6 a typical dependence of the highest conditional Lyapunov exponent on

the value of the coupling parameter is shown for the values of parameters

α1 = 2.858π and α2 = 2.862π. One can see that for certain value of the cou-

pling parameter ε = εGS (marked by an arrow in Fig. 6) the generalized syn-

chronization regime appears in the spatially extended beam-plasma systems.

Thus, with the coupling parameter increase the appearance of the generalized

synchronization is observed in the spatially extended beam plasma system.

When ﬁxing the ﬁrst system control parameter and changing parameter of the

18

second system one can plot the dependence of the generalized synchronization

appearance threshold εGS on the detuning between systems. In Fig. 7a such

dependence is plotted for the ﬁxed value of drive system control parameter;

one can see that with response system control parameter increase (in other

words with transition to the area of simpler oscillations Fig. 2) the threshold

of the generalized synchronization arising decreases. In Fig. 7b the value of the

threshold of the generalized synchronization regime εGS has been plotted for

the ﬁxed value of the response system control parameter α2 when changing

parameter α1 of the drive system. One can see that for the small detuning

between the systems the value of the generalized synchronization threshold

depends weakly on the drive system parameter.

In our works [29, 49] the various ways of the generalized synchronization aris-

ing in the coupled less-dimensional systems and coupled spatially extended

Ginzburg-Landau equations were discussed using the modiﬁed system ap-

proach. The main idea of this method is the substitution of two unidirec-

tional coupled oscillator systems by the modiﬁed response system being under

external inﬂuence of the drive system signal. This method was very help-

ful and eﬀective for the analysis of the generalized synchronization arising

mechanisms connected with presence of additional dissipation in the non-

autonomous chaotic system in the generalized synchronization regime [49].

Let us apply this method to the analysis of the generalized synchronization

arising mechanism in the coupled spatially extended beam-plasma systems. It

is necessary to examine the dynamics of the autonomous modiﬁed response

system taking into account the introducing of the additional dissipative term

in the same way as it has been done in [49]. In our case an autonomous

modiﬁed distributed system is described by the system of equations (1)—(3)

19

with the following boundary conditions for the potential

ϕ2m(0, t) = 0

ϕ2m(1, t) =

ερ2m(1, t)).

In this form the modiﬁed distributed system (1)—(3) may be considered as a

Pierce diode ﬂuid model with a connected feedback loop. Similar system has

been suﬃciently investigated in our work [48, 58, 59], here Pierce diode ﬂuid

model with external feedback has been examined. It has been shown for this

model, that with the feedback coeﬃcient (in the investigated case ε parame-

ter) increase the transition from chaotic dynamic to periodical oscillations is

observed through the cascade of the period doubling bifurcations.

As it has been shown in work [49], the existence of the regular oscillations or

steady states in the modiﬁed system is an essential condition for the general-

ized synchronization regime arising. Therefore, taking into account the results

of work [48], we can assert that, the mechanism of generalized synchronization

regime arising [49] is realized, but in the investigated case it is determined by

a reconstruction of oscillation regimes in modiﬁed system by means of con-

nection of the feedback of some sort rather than introducing of additional

dissipation.

It is illustrated by Fig. 8a, on which the bifurcation diagram of Pierce diode

with feedback is plotted while changing the control parameter ε. From the

ﬁgure one can see that, oscillations in the modiﬁed system become periodical

with coupling parameter increase and after that the arising of the steady state

is observed. However, the value of the coupling parameter, for which the arising

of the periodical oscillations in system is observed, is appreciably smaller than

20

Fig. 8. Bifurcation diagrams of the spatial charge density oscillations in the modiﬁed

system in case of autonomous dynamics (a) and under the external harmonic signal

(b). Pierce parameter of modiﬁed system is α2 = 2.862π

liminal value of εGS, for which the generalized synchronization regime arises.

As it was discussed in work [49] it is necessary to consider the modiﬁed system

under the external inﬂuence to ﬁnd the generalized synchronization threshold.

In this case, the external inﬂuence results in an increase of the parameter ε

value, for which the periodical oscillations is observed. Such behavior may

be illustrated by the examination of the modiﬁed system dynamics under

the external periodical inﬂuence. In the simplest case, this inﬂuence may be

assigned harmonic, whose frequency and amplitude must correspond to the

21

main base frequency of the power spectrum of the drive chaotic system.

In this case we change the boundary conditions (15) for modiﬁed system (1)—

(3) adding a harmonic signal:

ϕm(0, t) = 0






ϕm(1, t) =

ερr(1, t)) + εA cos(2πf0t),

−

(16)

where A = 0.78 and f0 = 1 have been chosen to simulate the main peak in

the power spectrum of the drive system.

In Fig. 8b Pierce diode oscillation bifurcation diagram is shown for the case of

external inﬂuence. One can see that, the bifurcation points of the modiﬁed sys-

tem under the external inﬂuence are shifted towards lager values of ε in com-

parison with the autonomous case (Fig. 8a). At the same time, two-frequency

oscillations with incommensurable time scales (quasi-periodical regular oscil-

lations) are observed in the system with the large values of feedback coeﬃcient

ε. This may be easily seen from the bifurcation diagram. Therefore, the value

of parameter for which the generalized synchronization appears accepts lager

values that in autonomous case.

Conclusions

Thus, the possibility of arising of the various types of chaotic synchroniza-

tion (complete synchronization and time-scale synchronization) in mutually

coupled beam-plasma systems with overcritical current (coupled Pierce diode

ﬂuid models) has been reported for the ﬁrst time in the paper. It is impor-

22

tant to note that the coupling was introduced only in one point of interaction

space. A new approach to chaotic synchronization — time-scale synchroniza-

tion [15, 17] has been used for the analysis of chaotic synchronization. It is

signiﬁcant that the possibility of the complete synchronization regime appear-

ance of the chaotic spatiotemporal beam-plasma oscillation makes possible the

application of such self-oscillating media for the data transmission systems of

the microwave range.

In case of unidirectional coupling the transition from asynchronous behavior

to the generalized synchronization regime has been observed with the coupling

parameter increase. For the ﬁxed control parameter (Pierce parameter) of the

drive system the generalized synchronization threshold decreases with the re-

sponse system Pierce parameter increase. For the ﬁxed value of the response

system Pierce parameter the value of coupling parameter corresponding to the

generalized synchronization regime arising depends weakly on the changing

of the drive system Pierce parameter. Such behavior of the generalized syn-

chronization appearance threshold was explained using the modiﬁed system

method proposed in work [49] for the analysis of the generalized synchroniza-

tion in the less-dimensional systems.

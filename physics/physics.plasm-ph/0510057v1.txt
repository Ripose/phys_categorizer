MHD dynamo generation via
Riemannian soliton theory

L.C. Garcia de Andrade 1

Abstract

Heisenberg spin equation equivalence to nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion recently demonstrated by Rogers and Schief , is applied to the
investigation of vortex ﬁlaments in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
dynamos. The use of Gauss-Mainard-Codazzi equations allows us to
investigate in detail the inﬂuence of curvature and torsion of vortex
ﬁlaments in the MHD dynamos. This application follows closely pre-
vious applications to Heisenberg spin equation to the investigations in
magnetohydrostatics given by Schief (Plasma Physics J.-2003).

1 Introduction

Recently Schief [1] have shown that the classical magnetohydrostatic equa-
tions of inﬁnitely conducting ﬂuids may be reduced to the integral potential
Heisenberg equation constraint to a Jacobian condition as long as the mag-
netic ﬁeld is constant along individual magnetic lines. Palumbo’s [2] toroidal
isodynamic equilibrium has been given as an example. Earlier Schief has also
[3] had provided another very interesting application of how the use of curva-
ture and torsion of lines aﬀects the plasma physical phenomena, by showing
that the equilibrium equations of MHD reduce to integral Pohlmeyer-Lund-
Regge [4] model subject to a volume preserving constraint if Maxwellian

surfaces are assumed to coincide with total pressure constant surfaces. In
that paper he provided nested toroidal ﬂux surfaces in magnetohydrostatics.
In this paper we provide two new applications of the use of the Heisenberg
spin equations to plasma physics. Namely , we apply the Gauss-Mainardi-
Coddazzi equations (GMC) [5] to MHD dynamos [6] to compute curvature
and torsion eﬀects on vortex ﬁlaments of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. Torsion
eﬀects on vortex ﬁlaments with and without magnetic ﬁelds have been pre-
viously investigated by Ricca [7]. More recently Garcia de Andrade [8] have
investigated the equilibrium of the magnetic stars more well-known as mag-
netars. Another interesting example to plasma physics is provided by the
Beltrami magnetic ﬂows [9]. These are very important problems in plasma
physics and therefore new mathematical methods to address the problem
may shed light on their solutions and their applications. This paper seems to
be useful to mathematical and plasma physicists. The paper is organised as
follows: Section 2 we review the mathematics apparatus of the Serret-Frenet
equations and the Heisenberg spin equations.
In section 3 we investigate
the application of this mathematical framework in explicitely plasma physics
problems as the Beltrami magnetic dynamos and the eﬀects of curvature and
torsion on vortex ﬁlaments.

2 Geometrical Heisenberg spin equation

In this section we reproduce for the beneﬁt of the reader some of the formu-
las derived by Rogers and Schief [10] on the Heisenberg spin equation and
geometry of curvature and torsion of lines. We begin by deﬁning a Serret-
Frenet frame composed of the vectors triad X = (~t, ~n,~b). The extended
Serret-Frenet formulas can be written in matrix form are given by

To simplify the magnetic ﬁeld computations in the next section we shall

consider here the particular case of Ωn = 0 which as has been shown by

Rogers and Schief implies the complex lamelar motions and the constancy

of magnitude along the streamlines. This geometrical condition implies that

the existence of two scalar functions Φ and ψ which satisfy the relation

Since tangent planes to the surfaces Φ = constant are generated by the unit
tangent ~t and the binormal ~b, or

~n = ψ∇Φ

~t.∇Φ = 0

~b.∇Φ = 0

Since ~n is parallel to the normal to surfaces Φ = const, the vector lines ~t are

geodesics on the surfaces which implies taht the b − lines are parallels on the

surface Φ = const. The s-lines and b-lines being the parametric curves on

the Φ = const surface then a surface metric can be written as

I = ds2 + g(s, b)db2

3 MHD dynamos and the Heisenberg equa-

In this section we shall make use of the Salingaros [9] formula for the self-

exciting MHD dynamos phenomenologically based, which is expressed as

∇× ~B = k~v× ~B

(32)

where the magnetic ﬁeld ~B = B(s, b, n)~t. In principle we have consider the

depence of the magnetic ﬁeld on the Serret-Frenet complete triad lines to later

on simplify this dependence from the ﬁeld equations of the MHD dynamo.

Substitution of this expression for ~B into the MHD dynamo equation (32)

we obtain

It is easy to note from this equation that Ωs = 0 also obtained by Rogers

and Schief [12]. This equation of the MHD dynamo should be supplemented

by the vanishing monopole condition

∇. ~B = 0

(34)

which imply together the following set of PDE dynamo MHD equations

In accordance with the Gauss-Weingarten equations for Φ = const we have

the same Serret-Frenet matriz above and

The Gauss-Mainardi-Codazzi equations and Ωs = 0 yields

since the ﬁrst term on the LHS of this equation vanishes due to the orthonor-

mality of the Serret-Frenet triad, yields

this implies that the curvature depends only on the s-line or κ = κ(s). Along

where τ (s, b) is the Riemannian torsion which according to Ricca [7] has only

something to do with the Cartan torsion tensor when the Serret-Frenet equa-

tion are extended to higher dimensions in string theory. Another possibility

is that one may ﬁnd analogies between the Cartan non-Riemannian torsion

and the Riemannian one , in Hasimoto soliton like transformation in the

Gross-Piraeviskii equation which are the relativistic counterpart of the non-

linear Sch¨odinger equation [11]. By considering the Φ = constant surfaces

we obtain the following general solution to the MHD dynamo system

The mathematical detailed application to dynamos considered here may help

to classify the dynamos in general coordinates as has been previously done

in part by Salingaros. Although Beltrami spatially periodic ﬁelds given by

are not self excited ﬁelds with ~B generated ﬁeld by Beltrami ﬂows, for com-

pletitude in the next section we apply the formalism developed by Rogers

and Schief to Beltrami ﬁelds.

4 Beltrami ﬁelds and ﬂows

Beltrami magnetic ﬂows are given by

∇×~v = k~v

(47)

Let us consider that the ﬂow velocity is along the s-line direction or ~v = vt~t.

One may note that the LHS of equation (47) represents the vorticity ~ω which

from Rogers and Schief work [10] yields

~ω = vtΩs~t + (

vt)~n + (vtκ −

∂
∂b

∂
∂n

vt)~b

(48)

Substitution of (48) into the Beltrami ﬂow equation yields

vtΩs~t +

vt~n + (vtκ −

vt)~b = m(vt~t)

(49)

∂
∂b

∂
∂n

Note that the this vectorial equation yields three equations

Ωs = m = constant

∂
∂b

vt = 0

10

(50)

(51)

Note that the equation (48) is diﬀernt from the equation in the case of MHD

dynamo phenomenology proposed by Salingaros, since the abnormality Ωs

does not vanish othewise the Beltrami ﬂow would be irrotational or ω = 0.

Applying the divergence operator to the Beltrami ﬂow equation yields

Since the LHS of the equation (53) vanishes the RHS yields

implies

which along with condition (51) shows that vt only depends on the n-line

direction. Thus integration of the remaining equation (52) yields

Let us now compute the Beltrami magnetic ﬁeld vortex line. By analogous

computations we did in the case of Beltrami ﬂows yields

∂
∂n

vt = κvt

∇.∇×~v = ∇.~v

∇.~v = 0

along with the equation of no magnetic monopole

∂

B + κB = 0

∇. ~B = 0

∂

B(n) = e[

Therefore the magnetic ﬁeld in the MHD Beltrami ﬂow is given in the form

~B(n) which from equation (58) yields the solution

which is a very distinct solution of the Salingaros dynamo MHD ﬁeld.

5 Conclusions

In conclusion, the eﬀects of curvature and torsion are displayed in MHD

dynamos by making use of solitons via teh Heisenberg spin-like equation

which is equivalent to Sch¨odinger nonlinear equation where the Hasimoto

soliton [12] transformation is performed and using also the mathematical

powerful tool of the Serret-Frenet generalised calculus. The comprehension

12

of the geometry and dynamics of vortex ﬁlaments in MHD dynamos maybe

certainly useful in applications to plasma and solar physics [13].

We have studied the nonlinear dynamics of whistler waves in magnetized plasmas. Since plas-
mas and beam-plasma systems considered here are assumed to be weakly collisional, the point of
reference for the analysis performed in the present paper is the system of hydrodynamic and ﬁeld
equations. We have applied the renormalization group method to obtain dynamical equations for
the slowly varying amplitudes of whistler waves. Further, it has been shown that the amplitudes
of eigenmodes satisfy an inﬁnite system of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations. In this sense,
the whistler eigenmodes form a sort of a gas of interacting quasiparticles, while the slowly varying
amplitudes can be considered as dynamical variables heralding the relevant information about the
system. An important feature of our description is that whistler waves do not perturb the initial
uniform density of plasma electrons. The plasma response to the induced whistler waves consists in
velocity redistribution which follows exactly the behaviour of the whistlers. In addition, selection
rules governing the nonlinear mode coupling have been derived, which represent another interesting
peculiarity of our description.

INTRODUCTION

Over four decades passed since it was ﬁrst shown that
plasmas and beam-plasma systems immersed in an ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld can support travelling electromag-
netic waves with speciﬁc features. These waves propa-
gate parallel to the applied magnetic ﬁeld being circu-
larly polarized in a plane transverse to the direction of
propagation. It has become conventional in the physics
of magnetized plasmas to call such structures waves in
the whistler mode.

Although the linear stability properties of the electro-
magnetic waves in the whistler mode are relatively well
studied [1, 2, 3, 4], there is a serious gap in the un-
derstanding of their nonlinear behaviour. Chen et al.
[5] have shown that electromagnetic whistler waves can
be considered as complementary to the nonlinear travel-
ling electrostatic waves, known as the Bernstein-Greene-
Kruskal (BGK) modes [6]. While the BGK modes are
longitudinal, the whistler modes are transverse, in other
words, the components of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld
of the whistler wave parallel to the external magnetic ﬁeld
are both zero. The study of the nonlinear behaviour of
whistler waves has been initiated by Taniuti and Washimi
[7], who obtained a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation for
the slowly varying amplitude (see also Reference [8]).

The present paper is aimed at ﬁlling the gap in the un-
derstanding of the nonlinear evolution of whistler waves.
The method adopted here is the renormalization group
(RG) method [9, 10]. The basic feature of this approach
is that it provides a convenient and straightforward tool
to obtain an adequate description of the physically es-
sential properties of self-organization and formation of
patterns in complex systems. Coherent structures which
result from the nonlinear interaction between plane waves
evolve on time and/or spatial scales comparatively large
compared to those the fast oscillations occur. The RG
method can be considered as a powerful systematic pro-
cedure to separate the relatively slow dynamics from the
fast one, which is of no considerable physical relevance.
In a context similar to that of the present paper, it has
been successfully applied by one of the authors [10, 11] to
study collective eﬀects in intense charged-particle beams.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section,
we state the basic equations which will be the subject of
the renormalization group reduction in section III. Start-
ing from a single equation [see equation (III.6)] for the
electromagnetic vector potential, we obtain a formal per-
turbation expansion of its solution to second order. As
expected, it contains secular terms proportional to pow-
ers of the time variable which is the only renormaliza-
tion parameter adopted in our approach. In section IV,
the arbitrary constant amplitudes of the perturbation ex-
pansion are renormalized such as to eliminate the secular
terms. As a result, a set of equations for the renormal-
ized slowly varying amplitudes is obtained, known as the
renormalization group equations (RGEs). These equa-
tions comprise an inﬁnite system of coupled nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations. In section V, the latter are ana-
lyzed in the simplest case. Finally, section VI is dedicated
to discussion and conclusions.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM AND
BASIC EQUATIONS

Plasmas and beam-plasma systems considered in the
present paper are assumed to be weakly collisional.
Therefore, the dynamics of plasma species is well de-
scribed by the hydrodynamic equations coupled with the
equations for the electromagnetic self-ﬁelds. We start
with the equations for plasma in an external constant
magnetic ﬁeld B0, which can be written as follows

∂na
∂t

+ ∇ · (naVa) = 0,

(II.1)

DaVa
Dt

= −

kBTa
mana

eqa
ma

∇na +

[E + Va × (B0 + B)],

(II.2)
where na and Va are the density and the current veloc-
ity of the species a. Furthermore, ma, qa and Ta are the
mass, the relative charge and the temperature, respec-
tively, while kB is the Boltzmann constant. The substan-
tional derivative on the left-hand-side of equation (II.2)
is deﬁned as

Da
Dt

=

∂
∂t

+ Va · ∇.

(II.3)

The electromagnetic self-ﬁelds E and B can be obtained
in terms of the electromagnetic vector A and scalar ϕ
potentials according to the well-known relations

E = −∇ϕ −

B = ∇ × A.

(II.4)

The latter satisfy the wave equations

In what follows, we consider the case of a quasineutral
plasma

(II.7)

in a constant external magnetic ﬁeld along the x-axis
B0 = (B0, 0, 0). Then, equations (II.1)–(II.6) possess a
stationary solution

na = na0 = const, Va = 0, A = 0, ϕ = 0.

(II.8)

The frequency of the wave will be taken as much higher
than the ion-cyclotron frequency. Therefore, we can fur-
ther neglect the ion motion and scale the hydrodynamic
and ﬁeld variables as

ne = n0 + ǫN, Ve = ǫV, A −→ ǫA, ϕ −→ ǫϕ,

2

where ǫ is a formal small parameter introduced for con-
venience, which will be set equal to one at the end of the
calculations. Thus, the basic equations to be used for the
subsequent analysis can be written in the form

+ n0∇ · V + ǫ∇ · (N V) = 0,

Before we continue with the renormalization group re-
duction of the system of equations (II.10)–(II.12) in the
next section, let us assume that the actual dependence
of the quantities N , V, A and ϕ on the spatial variables
is represented by the expression

Ψ =

Ψ(x, X; t),

Ψ = (N, V, A, ϕ),

(II.13)

where X = ǫx is a slow spatial variable. Thus, the only

renormalization parameter left at our disposal is the time
t which will prove extremely convenient and simplify te-
dious algebra in the sequel.

tively expressed according to the expression

vT = ωprD,

D =

(III.8)

where rD is the electron Debye radius. Equation (III.6)
represents the starting point for the renormalization
group reduction, the ﬁnal goal of which is to obtain a
description of the relatively slow dynamics leading to for-
mation of patterns and coherent structures.

Let us proceed order by order. We assume that the
dependence on the fast spatial variables x = (x, y, z) is
through the longitudinal (parallel to the external mag-
netic ﬁeld B0) x-coordinate only. The solution to the
zero-order perturbation equations (III.6) can be written
as

A0 =

A(0)

k Akeiψk ,

(III.9)

k
X

where

ψk(x; t) = kx − ωkt,

(III.10)

and Ak is an inﬁnite set of constant complex amplitudes,
which will be the subject of the renormalization proce-
dure in the sequel. Here ”constant” means that the am-
plitudes Ak do not depend on the fast spatial variable x

3

and on the time t, however, it can depend on the slow spa-
tial variables X. The summation sign in equation (III.9)
and throughout the paper implies summation over the
wave number k in the case where it takes discrete values,
or integration in the continuous case. From the disper-
sion equation

it follows that the wave frequency ωk can be expressed
in terms of the wave number k, where the Fourier-image
(cid:3)k of the d’Alembert operator can be written according
to

(cid:3)k =

ω2
k
c2 − k2.

(III.12)

Moreover, it can be veriﬁed in a straightforward manner
that the constant vector A(0)
k

can be expressed as

A(0)

k = (0, 1, −isgn(k)),

(III.13)

where sgn(k) is the well-known sign-function. Details
concerning the derivation of the dispersion law (III.11)
and equation (III.13) can be found in the Appendix. Note
that equation (III.13) is an alternative representation of
the solvability condition (A.3).
It is important to em-
phasize that

ω−k = −ωk,

A−k = A∗
k,

(III.14)

where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. The lat-
ter assures that the vector potential as deﬁned by equa-
tion (III.9) is a real quantity. The zero-order current ve-
locity V0 obtained directly from the ﬁrst equation (III.4)
can be written as

V0 =

V(0)

k Akeiψk ,

V(0)

k =

A(0)

(cid:3)k

In addition, the zero-order density, scalar potential and
magnetic ﬁeld are represented by the expressions

N0 ≡ 0,

ϕ0 ≡ 0,

expressed via quantities already known from zero order.

Equation (III.6) has now two types of solutions. The
ﬁrst is a secular solution linearly dependent on the time
variable in the ﬁrst-order approximation. As a rule, the
highest power in the renormalization parameter of the
secular terms contained in the standard perturbation ex-
pansion is equal to the corresponding order in the small
perturbation parameter. The second solution of equa-
tion (III.6) arising from the nonlinear interaction between
waves in the ﬁrst order, is regular. Omitting tedious but

A couple of interesting features of the zero and ﬁrst-
b
order perturbation solution are noteworthy to be com-
mented at this point. First of all, the zero-order density
N0 vanishes which means that no density waves are in-
duced by the whistler eigenmodes. The second terms in
the expressions for the ﬁrst-order density N1 and current
velocity V1 [see equations (III.33) and (III.37)] imply
contribution from nonlinear interaction between waves
according to the nonlinear Lorentz force. It will be shown
in the remainder that these terms give rise to nonlinear
terms in the renormalization group equation and describe
solitary wave behaviour of the whistler mode.

IV. THE RENORMALIZATION GROUP
EQUATION

Passing over to the ﬁnal stage of our renormalization
group procedure, we note that in second order the quanti-
ties U2 and W2 entering the right-hand-side of equation
(III.6) can be written as

U2 = −2∇ ·

Since we are interested only in the secular terms in sec-
ond order, appearing in the expressions for the y and z
components of the electromagnetic vector potential A2,
contributions in the source vectors U2 and W2 leading
to such terms are suﬃcient for completing the renormal-
ization group procedure. Thus, we can write

V. SYSTEM OF COUPLED NONLINEAR
SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATIONS

The simplest case of the validity of the solvability con-
dition (IV.4) consists in the assumption that the slow
wave amplitudes Ak do not depend on the transverse co-
ordinates. Setting ǫ = 1 in equation (IV.11), we obtain
the following system of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equations

(V.6)

This means that a generic mode with a wave number
k cannot couple with itself, neither can it couple with
another mode with a wave number of the same sign. Note
that this feature is a consequence of the vector character
of the nonlinear coupling between modes and is due to
the nonlinear Lorentz force. Therefore, for a given mode
k the simplest nontrivial reduction of the inﬁnite system
of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations consists of
minimum two coupled equations.

Without loss of generality, we can assume in what fol-
lows that the sign of an arbitrary mode k under consid-
eration is positive (k > 0). Suppose that for a particular
whistler mode with a positive wave number k there exist

(V.10)

The system of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations
(V.7) and (V.8) is non integrable in general [12]. It rep-
resents an important starting point for further investiga-
tions on the nonlinear dynamics and evolution of whistler
waves in magnetized plasmas.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We studied the nonlinear dynamics of whistler waves
in magnetized plasmas. Since plasmas and beam-plasma
systems considered here are assumed to be weakly colli-
sional, the point of reference for the analysis performed in
the present paper is the system of hydrodynamic and ﬁeld
equations. We apply the renormalization group method
to obtain dynamical equations for the slowly varying am-
plitudes of whistler waves. As a result of the investiga-
tion performed, it has been shown that the amplitudes
of eigenmodes satisfy an inﬁnite system of coupled non-
linear Schr¨odinger equations. In this sense, the whistler
eigenmodes form a sort of a gas of interacting quasiparti-
cles, while the slowly varying amplitudes can be consid-
ered as dynamical variables heralding the relevant infor-
mation about the system.

An important feature of our description is that whistler
waves do not perturb the initial uniform density of
plasma electrons. The plasma response to the induced
whistler waves consists in velocity redistribution which
follows exactly the behaviour of the whistlers. Another
interesting peculiarity are the selection rules governing
the nonlinear mode coupling. According to these rules
modes with the same sign do not couple, which is a direct
consequence of the vector character of the interaction.

Careful inspection shows that the initial source of the
nonlinear interaction between waves in the whistler mode
is the zero-order Lorentz force [see equation (III.21)].
Since the quantity W1 is proportional to A(0)
k × A(0)
,
the above mentioned selection rules follow directly, pro-
vided the only case in which the cross product does not
vanish is the case, where modes k and l have diﬀerent
sign.

l

We believe that the results obtained in the present
paper might have a wide class of possible applications
ranging from laboratory experiments to observations of
a variety of eﬀects relevant to space plasmas.

APPENDIX A: DETAILS CONCERNING THE
DERIVATION OF THE PERTURBATION
EXPANSION

Under the assumption that whistler waves propagate
parallel to the external magnetic ﬁeld B0 (dependence on
the longitudinal x-coordinate and the time t only), the
equation (III.6) for the longitudinal component Anx de-
couple from the equations for the other two components.
In zero order it has an obvious solution A0x = 0. The
perturbation equations for the transverse components of
the electromagnetic vector potential can be written as

of equation (III.6). These yield a secular solution to the
perturbation equations linear (in ﬁrst order) with respect
to the time t. Taking into account the resonant terms

alone, it can be veriﬁed that the operators

The solvability condition (A.3) which also holds in ﬁrst
order yields immediately equations (III.24) and (III.26).
Non resonant terms can be handled in a straightforward
manner, yielding the second term on the right-hand-side
of equation (III.23).

b

In second order the right-hand-side of equation (III.6)
contains resonant terms proportional to eiψk , as well as
terms proportional to teiψk . Contributions to the second-
order solution of the ﬁrst type can be handled in a way
similar to that already discussed in ﬁrst order. To deal
with the second type of resonant contributions, we write
the second-order perturbation equations as

(A.8)

To solve the above system of equations, we use the ansatz
(III.9). Then, the dispersion equation (III.11) can be
obtained in a straightforward manner as a condition for
vanishing of the determinant of the linear system consist-
ky and A(0)
ing of the components A(0)
kz . Moreover, from the
dispersion equation it follows that A(0)
kz is proportional to
A(0)

ky , that is

A(0)

kz = −isgn(k)A(0)
ky .

(A.3)

Equation (A.3) should be regarded as a solvability con-
dition and must be satisﬁed order by order.

The ﬁrst order is characterized by the presence of reso-
nant terms (proportional to eiψk ) on the right-hand-side

Cky = −

(A.10)

Lkz = −iLkysgn(k).

(A.11)

Substituting the appropriate form of Hk and collecting
similar terms proportional to t and t2, we readily obtain
equations (IV.5)–(IV.7).

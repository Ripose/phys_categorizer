Parametric instabilities in magnetized multicomponent plasmas

This paper investigates the excitation of various natural modes in a magnetized bi-ion or dusty
plasma. The excitation is provided by parametrically pumping the magnetic ﬁeld. Here two ion-like
species are allowed to be fully mobile. This generalizes our previous work where the second heavy
species was taken to be stationary. Their collection of charge from the background neutral plasma
modiﬁes the dispersion properties of the pump and excited waves. The introduction of an extra
mobile species adds extra modes to both these types of waves. We ﬁrstly investigate the pump
wave in detail, in the case where the background magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the direction
of propagation of the pump wave. Then we derive the dispersion equation relating the pump to
the excited wave for modes propagating parallel to the background magnetic ﬁeld. It is found that
there are a total of twelve resonant interactions allowed, whose various growth rates are calculated
and discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The basic natural modes of magnetized plasmas such
as those that occur in molecular clouds, cometary plas-
mas and stellar atmospheres are of great interest. When
the frequencies are low then a class of linear waves, re-
ferred to collectively as Alfv´en waves, are known to exist
and are of importance to the understanding of many ba-
sic plasma phenomena [1, 2]. The linear approximation
to these waves breaks down at large amplitudes where
nonlinear eﬀects become important in their propagation.
One such large amplitude wave is a magnetoacoustic
wave, which modiﬁes the background magnetic ﬁeld in an
oscillatory fashion, and so can be considered as a pump
wave that drives other waves nonlinearly. Such large-
amplitude pump waves may occur in conditions such as
seen in solar and space plasmas. For example, solar shock
waves can set up large amplitude standing magnetoacous-
tic waves in coronal loops or magnetic ﬂux tubes [3, 4, 5].
By considering perturbations of this large amplitude
pump, we can investigate the possibility of exciting nat-
ural modes of the system, such as Alfv´en waves, due to
a resonant interaction between the pump wave and the
natural waves. In the single ion species case this basic
phenomenon was predicted by [6, 7], and subsequently
pursued by several authors [8, 9, 10]. For a pump mag-
netic ﬁeld parallel to the background magnetic ﬁeld in a
single ion species plasma, the excited waves are Alfv´en
waves travelling in opposite directions along the magnetic
ﬁeld [6, 7]. If ion-cyclotron eﬀects are included, the ex-
cited waves are the fast and slow (ion–cyclotron) Alfv´en
waves travelling in opposite directions [8]. More general
behavior is allowed in the case where the excited waves
are permitted to travel obliquely to the magnetic ﬁeld
[11].

The parametric excitation of waves in a dusty magne-
tized plasma has been investigated in Ref. [12], but in the
approximation where the dust is taken to be immobile.
In that case the oppositely travelling pair of waves are
modiﬁed, with the presence of a cutoﬀ frequency in the
fast Alfv´en wave. Furthermore, an interaction between
a pair of fast waves or a pair of slow waves was found
to exist. The corresponding growth rates of the slow-fast
and fast-fast pairs were maximized as a function of the
dust concentration.

Many space and laboratory plasmas are multicompo-
nent, i.e., contain multiple ion species.
It is therefore
of great interest to investigate the eﬀects of the addi-
tional species on the linear and nonlinear properties of
the waves in the plasma. For instance, it is often the
case that in the presence of an additional ion compo-
nent an extra mode is excited, or forbidden regions of
frequency are introduced. One area of study of multi-
ion plasmas is the bi-ion plasma. The inclusion of one
extra ion species often captures the basic information of
several extra species. The bi-ion plasma has particular
importance in plasma fusion, laboratory plasmas and in
astrophysical environments, with the secondary ion usu-
ally positively charged.

A dusty plasma adds another level of interest to the
topic of multicomponent plasmas, due to the dust prop-
erties. Dust is an additional impurity of large mass and
often of negative charge. Under the simplest approxima-
tion, all the dust grains may be considered to have the
same mass and equilibrium charge, and so are equivalent
to a second ion species. This is the case considered in this
paper. It is known that the inclusion of dust in a plasma
may introduce cutoﬀ frequencies into the basic Alfv´en
waves, and introduce a low frequency mode, whose na-
ture is diﬀerent from that in a bi-ion plasma due to the
dust grain’s extremely high mass [13, 14]. Qualitative
diﬀerences to the bi-ion case arise when charge perturba-
tions of the grains are included, leading to an additional
damping mechanism [15], or when a spectrum of dust
grain sizes and charges is allowed for [16]. Dust is found,

in varying amounts, in many astrophysical and space en-
vironments such as molecular clouds and the rings of Sat-
urn. Dusty plasmas have also been studied closely ex-
perimentally, since the heavy grain mass introduces low
frequency eﬀects that may be studied in real time.

An immediate consequence of the presence of an ad-
ditional ion species is its modiﬁcation of the background
free-electron number density. This inﬂuences the propa-
gation of plasma and electromagnetic waves [15, 17, 18].
If in the case of a dusty plasma we ﬁx the grain charge,
then the grain becomes entirely deﬁned in terms of its
mass and charge, and as such acts just like another ion
in the plasma (albeit of negative charge). The state of
charge neutrality may be written as:

ene + eZ1n1 + eZ2n2 = 0.

−

102

Here ne,1,2 is the number density of plasma electrons
(with the charge
e), and the two ion species (of signed
charge Z1 and Z2), respectively. For laboratory dusty
plasmas, the grain charge is negative (i.e., Z2 < 0) and
103), so that an appreciable propor-
large (
Z2| ∼
|
tion of the negative charge in the plasma may reside on
the dust particles. For astrophysical dusty plasmas,
Z2|
|
may only be of the order of unity, which is often the case
for a canonical bi-ion plasma. In environments such as
the interstellar medium, where the dust grain is in an
electron-proton plasma with little ultra-violet radiation
present, the dust grains acquire a negative charge. On
the other hand, exposure to ultraviolet light from nearby
stars can cause ionization of the grains, leaving a residual
positive charge.

In this paper, we investigate the propagation of plane
hydromagnetic waves (Alfv´en waves and magnetoacous-
tic waves modiﬁed by the presence of a secondary ion
or dust species in a bi-ion plasma), propagating paral-
lel to the pumped magnetic ﬁeld of a large amplitude
magnetoacoustic wave. We generalize Ref. [12] where the
second heavy space was assumed immobile, to the case
where both ions are fully mobile. A further generaliza-
tion is the inclusion of pressure. The background mag-
netic ﬁeld and plasma density are taken to be uniform, at
frequencies well below the electron plasma and cyclotron
frequencies. First, we ﬁnd the dispersion equation of the
pump wave, and then concentrate on pump waves of large
wavelength. We then obtain a coupled pair of equations
of motion governing the perturbed plasma. Resonant
interactions are sought, and growth rates of the waves
parametrically excited by the pump are calculated and
discussed.

II. MULTIFLUID MODEL

The most general set of equations used to describe
two mobile ion-like species, plus electrons, is a three-ﬂuid
model. In this picture we employ three momentum equa-
tions for the electrons and the two ion species, where we
include both the ions’ inertia terms, while ignoring the

2

(4)

(5)

(6)

electron inertia. This is valid if the frequencies of interest
are well below the electron cyclotron frequency. In addi-
tion we use Maxwell’s equations and two mass continuity
equations for each of the ion species, ignoring Maxwell’s
displacement current.

The primary species (assumed positively charged) shall
be denoted with a “1” subscript, and the secondary
species (either positively or negatively charged) shall be
denoted with a “2” subscript. In this notation we may
write the current density as

J = Z1en1v1 + Z2en2v2 −

eneve,

(2)

where the two ion species and electrons have velocities
denoted by v1, v2, and ve, respectively. We employ the
parameters δ1 = ne/Z1n1 and δ2 = ne/Z2n2, which mea-
sure the distribution of charge in the plasma amongst
the ions. Employing the total charge neutrality condi-
tion, given in Eq. (1), we may write this as

Ignoring collisions, but including the eﬀects of pres-
sure, the starting equations for the velocities, electric
and magnetic ﬁelds and each number density are the mo-
mentum equations, the two ion continuity equations, and

isothermal changes, which permits us to write down Uα in
terms of the plasma temperatures, i.e., U 2
α = kBTα/mα
is the square of each thermal speed, where Tα is each
temperature and kB is Boltzmann’s constant.

At this point we choose to eliminate the electron vari-
ables from Eqs. (4)–(9), and use Faraday’s law to elimi-
nate the electric ﬁeld E. There are then two choices for

the way to proceed. We can add and subtract the mo-
mentum equations and deal with a total ﬂuid velocity
and the current density J. Instead we shall employ the
most direct method, which is to deal with the ion veloci-
ties v1 and v2 separately, since our equations will exhibit
the most symmetry this way. By employing the charge
neutrality condition to all orders, the following system of

In Eqs. (11)–(15) ρ1,2 = m1,2n1,2 are the densities of

sociated with the electron pressure (if Z2 < 0 we allow α2

both equations of motion, is a consequence of the elimi-
nation of the electron variables from the equations. To be
more explicit, the electron density ﬂuctuations generate
ﬂuctuations in both the ion densities through the charge
neutrality condition, which produces this coupling in the
momentum equations. The second term on the right
hand side of Eq. (13) is the Hall term; it is important
when the wave frequency is comparable to either of the
cyclotron frequencies. Also, we see that the two species
are strongly coupled through the momentum equations,
via the third term on the right hand side in each. This is
an additional Hall-type term associated with the relative
motion of the two species. Note Eqs. (11)–(14) reduce, in
,
δ2| → ∞
the case of a single species plasma (δ1 →

assuming local charge neutrality is maintained), to the
equations used in Ref. [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] where non-
linear Alfv´en waves were investigated. They are then
known as the (collisionless) Hall-MHD (magnetohydro-
dynamics) equations.

III. MAGNETOACOUSTIC PUMP WAVE

Suppose there is a constant background magnetic ﬁeld
in the z-direction, given by B0ˆz. We now periodically
pump the ﬁeld, with a periodic modulation:

B0[1 + ¯εb cos(ω0t)]ˆz,

(18)

where ω0 is the pump frequency. Here ¯ε is a constant
dimensionless quantity which determines the amplitude
of the pump. More precisely, ¯ε is an expansion param-
eter, which permits us to keep track of our terms, by
matching powers of ¯ε. The parameter b on the other
hand is a dimensionless quantity that we include to cap-
ture any necessary frequency information, i.e., b = b(ω0),
such that the average of b over ω0 is O(1). By speci-
fying a particular choice of normalization condition, we
may solve for b. We later in fact impose the condition
that the energy density in the pump system is a constant
over ω0, and calculate the resulting b. Since we are in-
terested in a large amplitude pump wave, ¯ε will typically
be O(10−2

10−1).

However, since this ﬁeld has no spatial dependence, it
does not satisfy our wave equations. Hence this is an
approximation to a wave with a large wavelength. We
must therefore modify the pump with an envelope of
some wavelength. Since the pump wave magnetic ﬁeld
points in the z-direction, the wavevector should point
B = 0. For a planar
perpendicular to this to satisfy
geometry plasma, we choose the axes such that the wave
varies in the x-direction, with wavenumber k0. By denot-
ing the pump magnetic ﬁeld (and all subsequent pump
ﬁelds) with a “0” superscript, we have

∇ ·

−

B(0) = B0[1 + ¯εb cos(k0x) cos(ω0t)]ˆz.

(19)

In a cylindrical plasma, with r denoting the radial dis-
tance from the cylindrical axis, we have

B(0) = B0[1 + ¯εbJ0(k0r) cos(ω0t)]ˆz,

(20)

where J0 is the 0th order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind.
Note that b = b(k0, ω0) in Eqs. (19) and (20).

In the absence of a wave, we shall suppose that the
plasma is stationary, with ion densities ρ01,2 and charge
ratios of δ01,2. The eﬀect of pumping will be to modify

These quantities deﬁne the pump wave, and we now pro-
ceed to solve the equations (11)–(15) to order ¯ε (i.e., the
linear solution).

By inspecting the form of the magnetic ﬁeld in Eq. (19)
[or (20)], and Eqs. (14) and (15), we note that the velocity
cannot have a z-component. Hence, the velocities of the
ion species must be of the form

¯v1 = (¯vx1, ¯vy1, 0) ,

¯v2 = (¯vx2, ¯vy2, 0)

(24)

for planar waves. From the resulting pair of equations
we ascertain the form of each velocity component and
density:

¯vx1,2 = Ax1,2 sin(k0x) sin(ω0t),
¯vy1,2 = Ay1,2 sin(k0x) cos(ω0t),
¯ρ1,2 = R1,2 cos(k0x) cos(ω0t),

(25)
(26)
(27)

where Ax1,2, Ay1,2 and R1,2 are amplitudes independent
of space and time, to be determined. Then, from the
continuity equations, we have

R1 = ρ01

The behavior of

choice of branch from the dispersion relation; see Fig. 2,
where for brevity we plot Ax1,y1 only. We see that as
, the x-component approaches a ﬁnite positive
k0 → ∞
value while the y-component approaches zero for the
upper branch of the dispersion relation. On the other
hand the x-component approaches large values and the
y-component passes through zero for the lower branch of
the dispersion relation.

Note that the two branches stemming from the up-
per branch of the dispersion relation become singular as
0. This motivates the need for a normalization
k0 →
condition relating the pump ﬁeld amplitudes of the ve-

plasma and on the perturbations to the equilibrium. This
is justiﬁed since we are interested only with frequencies
that are much less than that of the electron plasma fre-
quency. This means the electrons have suﬃcient time to
respond to the perturbations from the equilibrium and
neutralize the plasma at each point in space. Thus, on
the perturbed plasma we impose the condition,

Using the derived set of quantities characterizing the
pump wave we may, in principle, investigate the possibil-
ity of excited modes propagating at arbitrary angles with
respect to the z-axis, as in Ref. [11]. However, by remov-
ing the x-dependence in the pump waves our calculations
become much more tractable, with the requirement that
our excited waves are restricted to parallel propagation
along the z-axis, see Ref. [8].

ever, this would clearly be inconsistent with wavenum-
ber matching of a propagating pump with ﬁnite perpen-
dicular wavenumber. We therefore envisage this anal-
ysis to apply to a standing wave (in the transverse di-
rection) pump in a ﬁnite geometry system, such as a
cylindrical or toroidal laboratory plasma, or an astro-
physical magnetic ﬂux tube; by seeking localized solu-
tions for distances transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld such
that k0x = O(¯ε) in a planar plasma, or k0r = O(¯ε) in a
cylindrical plasma, we can recover the initially proposed
form for the magnetic ﬁeld Eq. (18). In other words, we
are taking x small rather than k0 small, to ensure that
the ﬁelds will look approximately uniform in the perpen-
dicular direction, i.e. that the wavelength is eﬀectively
very long on the length scale of interest. In the parallel
direction, however, the pump ﬁelds are uniform, we place
no such restriction on distances and excited wavelengths,
and we can apply wavenumber matching of the excited
wave ﬁelds in that direction, as discussed in Section VI.

For an inﬁnitely extended medium, the perpendicular
wavenumber of the excited waves is then zero. How-

Next we wish to test the stability of the self consistent
linear solution given in Eqs. (43)–(50), now regarded as

a ﬁnite-amplitude pump wave, to the excitation of waves
propagating along the magnetic ﬁeld direction. We must
however be careful since this is only a linearized pump
solution. To proceed we will adopt the basic methodology
of Refs. [7, 8], but shall attempt to reﬁne the argument.
The basic technique is to perturb each quantity, i.e.,
B(0), v(0), ρ(0), δ(0), by an arbitrarily small amount as
measured by an expansion parameter ε′. For example,
take an arbitrary ﬁeld, say X, with a known linear rep-
resentation of the pump ﬁeld: X (0) = X0 + ¯ε ¯X. Then
Refs. [7, 8] proceed by perturbing this quantity in the
following way:

X = X (0) + ε

′

′

.

X

(51)

However, since X (0) has neglected terms of O(¯ε2), the
term of O(ε′) is even more so negligible in this expansion
(recall that ε′ is arbitrarily small). The problem lies in
the fact that we are ultimately interested in the stability
of the exact pump solution, say Y (0) = X0 + ¯ε ¯Y , with
¯Y = ¯X + O(¯ε).

(52)

Thus, we shall perform the following expansion instead:
X = Y (0) + ε′X ′.

(53)

Upon substitution into our set of nonlinear diﬀerential
equations (11)–(15), we obtain a set of equations of the
following structure (no approximations):

¯εA( ¯Y ) + ¯ε2B( ¯Y ) + ε

′

′

C(X
) + ε
= ¯εε′E( ¯Y , X ′),

′2D(X

′

)

(54)

where A, B, C, D, E are diﬀerential operators acting on
their respective arguments which we may treat as func-
tions (for brevity we have suppressed their dependence
on ﬁelds other than X). Now ¯εA( ¯Y ) + ¯ε2B( ¯Y ) = 0 by
deﬁnition of an exact pump solution. Also, the term of
O(ε′2) can certainly be neglected. Next, we Taylor ex-
pand E( ¯Y , X ′) and write

E( ¯Y , X ′) = E( ¯X, X ′) + O(¯ε).

(55)

We are then permitted to neglect this term of O(¯ε) when
inserted back into Eq. (54). This gives us a set of equa-
tions for the perturbation X ′, in terms of the ¯X, to suf-
ﬁcient accuracy, i.e.,

C(X ′) = ¯εE( ¯X, X ′).

(56)

Note that ¯X has served two purposes. First, it gives us
an approximate description of the corresponding exact
solution Y (0) = X0 + ¯ε ¯Y , and second, it allows us to
investigate its stability without ever having to ﬁnd ¯Y .

V. EQUATIONS OF MOTION AND NATURAL
MODES

Our task then is to ascertain the primed variables
which are the excited ﬁelds. As stated previously, we

7

are interested only in plane waves that travel parallel to
the z-axis. In this case, any longitudinal components will
decouple completely and merely describe a linear acous-
tic wave, so we may set the z-component of the primed
velocity to zero. Hence, both primed velocities have the
following form:

y1,2(z, t), 0).

Here the terms of O(¯ε), which occur on the right hand
side, should be thought of as driving terms from the
pump wave. Note that there exist two further equations
of motion under the index interchange 1
2. Note also
that there are no acoustic terms on the left hand sides of
these equations because of the decoupling of the longitu-
dinal motions: however there are still acoustic inﬂuences
in the pump ﬁelds on the right hand sides of the equa-
tions.

Now in order to treat the x and y components of the
B and v vectors on an equal footing we form a complex
vector out of each component of these partial diﬀerential
equations, utilizing the variables v± = vx
ivy. The spa-
tial variation is assumed to be periodic in the z-direction
with wavenumber k, as follows: exp(ikz). Given this, the

In an analogous way to the classic driven pendulum
problem [25], we have found that the velocities of the
two species satisfy a pair of generalized Mathieu equa-
tions. Furthermore, the two species and magnetic ﬁeld
are strongly coupled. To proceed, we move from the time
domain to the frequency domain, under the Fourier trans-
form:

and ω± := ω
ω0. Eq. (64) is obviously not an algebraic
expression from which we can uniquely obtain the dis-
persion equation between ω and k. Instead it provides us
with a functional relationship between the Fourier trans-
forms with arguments ω, ω

−
Nevertheless, we may proceed by noting that the right
hand is O(¯ε), which is small. For the left hand side to be
small we must ensure that the frequency is near a root
of the polynomial on this side with a correction of O(¯ε),
i.e.,

ω0 and ω + ω0.

ω = χ + O(¯ε),

(69)

where χ is deﬁned to satisfy,

F±(χ) = 0.

(70)

These deﬁne the naturally occurring modes in the ab-
sence of pumping, (i.e., if ¯ε = 0 then ω = χ). The solu-
tions of these algebraic expressions give the dispersion re-
lations characterizing plane transverse waves propagating
parallel to the background magnetic ﬁeld in a two species
plasma. The last term of F± is only present when a sec-
ondary moving ion-like species resides in the plasma. It
is an additional Hall-type term, associated with the rela-
tive motion of the two charged species. In the one species

and we are left with the familiar fast and slow (ion-

= 0,

(71)

∓

The important feature of the two-species result in
Eq. (70) is that it is a cubic in χ and hence another
mode of excitation has been added. Moreover, since we
may choose F+ or F− it follows that there are a total of
six solutions; three are left hand circularly polarized and
three are right hand circularly polarized. However, only
three of these are physically diﬀerent. This is because
if χ satisﬁes F+(χ) = 0, then
χ) = 0,
and vice versa. We may then concentrate on the positive
frequency solutions.

χ satisﬁes F−(

−

If the secondary species is positively charged then there
are two left hand modes of excitation [14]. These we de-
note by ωLs and ωLf , where the “s” denotes slow, and the
“f” denotes fast. There is also a single right hand mode,
denoted by ωR. The corresponding dispersion relations
are plotted in Fig. 4(a). Note that the right hand mode
intersects with the fast left hand mode. Also, the two
.
left hand modes both experience a resonance as k
→ ∞
For ωLf it is given by Ω1, and for ωLs it is given by Ω2
(where we have assumed Ω1 > Ω2).

For a negatively charged secondary species there are
also three modes of excitation, however the combination
of polarizations has changed. In this case there are two
right hand modes ωRf and ωRs, and a single left hand
mode ωL; see Fig. 4(b). Here ωRs has a resonance at
Ω2, and ωL has a resonance at Ω1. In the dusty plasma
−
case, further properties of these modes were investigated
in Refs. [13, 26, 27].

Note that the upper curves (fast modes), regardless of
the sign of the species, experience a nonzero cutoﬀ fre-
quency which coincides with that of the pump frequency,
see Eq. (30).

VI. GROWTH RATES OF PARAMETRIC
INTERACTION

From the above analysis we see that χ may be any
one of ωLs, ωLf , ωR for a positively charged secondary
species, or ωRs, ωRf , ωL for a negatively charged sec-
ondary species. Since the frequency describing the ex-
cited wave is a perturbation of a natural mode frequency,
we denote the change by φ which is allowed to be com-
plex, where

ω = χ + ¯εφ.

(72)

Now by returning to the Fourier transform relationship
in Eq. (64) we can see what eﬀect φ (i.e., pumping) will
have on V±. Without any pumping (i.e., ¯ε = 0) the spa-
tial solutions would be a linear superposition of three
pure monochromatic exponentials. Hence the Fourier

Fig. 5(a) for a representation. The eﬀect of pumping is to
modify this and provide frequency shifts. The modiﬁed
solution will have some broadened frequency spectrum,
since it is the case that Dirac-δ functions do not solve
the Fourier transformed equations in the presence of a
pump. These types of modiﬁcations will occur near each
natural frequency; see Fig. 5(b) for a simpliﬁed represen-
tation of this eﬀect. In fact an exact solution would be
more complicated with the identiﬁcation of harmonics
etc, but this ﬁgure should illuminate the key feature of
the interaction.

This is described as a parametric interaction between
the excited ﬁelds due to the pump ﬁelds.

greatest, as in Refs. [7, 8]. It is clear that this eﬀect will
be greatest when the right hand side of Eq. (64) is large,
which is the resonance condition. This occurs when one
of the Fourier transforms on the right hand side is reso-
nant, in other words when their arguments are near one
of the χ’s, as conveyed in Fig. 5. Since the right hand
side of Eq. (64) involves terms of the form: V(ω+) and
V(ω−), it follows that there will be a large parametric
interaction when ω + ω0 or ω
ω0 satisﬁes this. Now, as
mentioned earlier we are restricting our attention to pos-
itive ω (without loss of generality). Under this condition,
ω0 can satisfy this. Moreover,
it is found that only ω
there are three choices for this interaction: a left hand

Let us now address the issue of the treatment of the
wavenumber k in our pair of interacting waves. First,
note that in the z-direction the pump wavenumber k0 is
zero. For the natural modes we have that a wave given
by (k,
χ) is physically equivalent to a wave given by
k, χ). Thus our two interacting waves will be given by
(
−
k, χ2), where χ1, χ2 are any combination
(k, χ1) and (
of ωL, ωLs, ωLf , ωR, ωRs, ωRf . Hence the wavenumbers
associated with each interacting wave are equal and op-
posite, i.e.,

−

−

k1 + k2 = 0,

(74)

which is a statement of conservation of momentum in the
z-direction. The fact that the right hand side is zero re-
ﬂects the spatial uniformity of the pump wave. This tells
us that if the approximately spatially uniform standing
pump wave decays, then it does so into two daughter
waves of equal wavelength travelling in opposite direc-
tions. Since the wavenumber magnitudes are equal we
may just consider the wavenumber k without referring
to the sense of polarization. This is a direct generaliza-
tion of the previous investigations in [7, 8, 14].

With the above framework we now proceed to solve for
φ from the Fourier transform relationship. We discuss
the method involved in obtaining φ in the case where
a left handed wave interacts with a right handed wave,
denoted φLR. Here we may assume, without loss of gen-
erality, that χ = χL in Eq. (72), where χL is any one of
ω0
ωL, ωLs, ωLf . This will interact with
may be any one of

ωRf ,
Following the methodology of Ref. [28] we form another
equation corresponding to (64) under the transformation
ω0. In the resulting two equations, we neglect
ω
the obviously nonresonant terms V(ω+) and V(ω
2ω0).
Additionally, due to our particular choice of interaction,
i.e., left-right, we neglect V+(ω−) and V−(ω), and retain
only V+(ω) and V+(ω−). We ﬁnd the following:

In the one ion species analysis, it is at this point that
the conservation of energy and momentum rules are used
to explicitly obtain χL, χR, k. The procedure is to use F±
to solve for χL,R in terms of k. These solutions are then
added together and equated to ω0. The resultant expres-
sion is then solved for k and subsequently substituted into
the expressions for χL,R. This process explicitly shows
that the resonance condition, for a given value of pump
frequency ω0, uniquely determines the frequencies and
wavenumbers of the excited waves. Now, this is all pos-
sible since the solution of F± in the one species limit is
merely a quadratic, see Eq. (71). However, in our case
we must solve a cubic. As such, the resulting expressions
for χL, χR, k are too complicated to be reproduced here.
Let us just note that it is still true that ω0 determines
them uniquely.

In order to solve for φLR in Eq. (75) we Taylor expand
F+(χL + ¯εφLR) around χL to order ¯ε, then use the fact
that F+(χL) = 0, to obtain

F+(χL + ¯εφLR) = ¯εφLRH(χL),

Although this was derived assuming we were near a
natural frequency of a left hand mode, we obtain the
same expression for φ2 for the right hand case (viz. φ2
RL)
with the modiﬁcation that φRL is of the opposite sign.

This technique may also be applied to both the left-
left interactions and the right-right interactions. This
includes the possibility of a slow wave interacting with
a fast wave (e.g., ωLs and ωLf ), and waves of equal fre-
quency interacting. These sorts of interactions occur only
because of the velocity derivative terms in (48) & (49). In
obtaining φ we must retain and neglect the appropriate
selection of Fourier transforms according to the choice

made. Here we introduce χL1 and χL2 as two (possible
equal) left hand modes, and χR1 and χR2 as two (possible
equal) right hand modes. The corresponding frequency
changes are obtained from

It is worth noting that in other types of parametric
problems, such as modulational and beam instabilities,
a graphical approach is useful in classifying the instabil-
ities; they occur where two normal mode lines cross and
reconnect [29, 30]. In those cases the number of interact-
ing modes is ﬁnite, and the nonlinear dispersion relation
can be obtained in closed form. In our case, however, we
cannot obtain the nonlinear dispersion relation in closed
form, due to the inﬁnite number of interacting modes;
the decay interaction of the two excited modes with the
pump is postulated in the ﬁrst approximation, and the
classiﬁcation of the instability is relatively straightfor-
ward.

VII. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

LL, φ2

LR, φ2

From the expressions for φ2

RR it is easy to
see that these quantities are real valued when we are in
a frequency-wavenumber regime such that a pump wave
can propagate. Hence φ is either purely real or purely
imaginary.
If φ is real then what we have found is a
correction to the natural mode frequency which adds an
extra Fourier component to the ﬁeld expansions. If φ is
imaginary then the daughter waves will either undergo
exponential growth or decay. Moreover, since there will
exist both a positive and a negative imaginary frequency
solution and since the frequency is conserved, this implies
that one of the daughter waves will grow and the other
will decay. In such cases the presence of one exponentially
growing daughter wave implies that anywhere in which
φ2 < 0 is a region of instability.
In this case φ is the
growth rate.

In Fig. 6 we plot the full complement of (normalized)
squared frequency changes. That is, we plot (φLR/Ω1)2
versus pump frequency ω0/Ω1 for the upper “U ” and
lower “L” branches of the pump dispersion relation for
each mode of interaction. This ﬁgure is for a warm
plasma in which the second heavy species is positively
charged. The same basic features are present in the neg-
atively charged case. All curves labelled “s”, i.e., “U s”
and “Ls”, correspond to the combination between ωR
and ωLs, that is the slow interaction. The curves labelled
“f ”, i.e., “U f ” and “Lf ”, are for the fast interaction be-
tween ωR and ωLf .

In both plots the second species is positive, with

δ01 = 1.002 in (b). Also, “U s, U f , Ls, Lf ” denotes the upper-
slow, lower-slow, upper-fast and lower-fast combinations, re-
spectively. Here “N ” denotes the single species result.

In Fig. 6(a), where δ01 = 1.02, the full spectrum of per-
turbations to the natural modes is seen. The U f interac-
tion is unstable and monotonically decreases, approach-
ing the single species result N for large ω0. Hence this is
indeed consistent with the single ion analysis, given by

The Lf interaction is also unstable, however it experi-
ences a minimum (corresponding to a maximum growth
rate), about which it turns over and approaches zero. For
our choice of parameters, in this ﬁgure, this occurs near
0.2 Ω1. Moreover the intersection with N occurs at
ω0 ∼

0.45 Ω1. Next, we see that the U s interaction, is
ω0 ∼
small and positive, and hence it is weakly stable. Note,
however, that if higher order terms are included in the
ﬁeld expansions then this may in fact prove to be weakly
unstable. Finally, we see that the Ls interaction, which
is only present in a warm plasma, is strongly unstable,
with a growth rate that approaches inﬁnity at a rate con-
siderably faster than N or U f .

As we decrease the number density of the second
species in Fig. 6(b) to δ01 = 1.002 some interesting fea-
tures appear. The U f curve shows a sharply varying
growth rate at just above the cutoﬀ frequency. The Lf
minimum shifts to a lower value (lying beyond the range
of the plot). The U s interaction has actually become
unstable in the frequency region just above the cutoﬀ
frequency. Also, the manner in which our bi-ion result
approaches the single species result as δ01 →

esting: the envelope of the three modes Ls, U s, and U f

In Fig. 7 we plot the range of left-left interactions for
the positively charged secondary species case. As can be
seen in Fig. 4(a) this case has two left handed branches
(slow and fast). Hence we may form the slow-slow, fast-
fast and slow-fast combinations. This combined with the
lower and upper branches of the pump dispersion relation
gives a total of six interactions. Of these six we ﬁnd that
all are unstable, except the “Lsf ” combination which
experiences a point of maximum stability at just below
2ωc. Note that the “Lss” interaction decreases without

Although it lies below the range of the plot the “Lf f ”

note the curious feature wherein the “U sf ” interaction

Finally, in Fig. 8 we plot the range of right-right in-
teractions for the negatively charged secondary species
case. Again by inspection of Fig. 4(b) it makes sense
that there are six values of φ2
RR. This plot shares many
features in common with the previous plot. However, an
important change is that the Lss interactions has a min-
imum and approaches zero as k
. Also, the U sf
maximal growth rate has shifted to much higher values
of pump frequency. The Lsf interaction has stability as
ω0 increases.

Hence, we have seen that the introduction of a second
species adds a range of extra behaviors, even with a small
number density. Note that in the special case where the
frequencies of diﬀerent modes coincide, the selection of
resonant Fourier transforms to generate these plots is ac-
tually invalid. In particular, this occurs at the point seen
in Fig. 4(b) where ωR = ωLf . At that point there are
actually more terms resonant than have been accounted
for. However, since this occurs on a set of measure zero,
it has been ignored.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

13

This paper has outlined an investigation into a cer-
tain class of instabilities in a bi-ion or dusty plasma, al-
lowing full mobility of all species and the inclusion of
pressure. The results should be applicable to a wide
range of laboratory and space plasmas where secondary
ion species or charged dust grains occur. The immediate
consequence of the presence of an extra heavy species is
its increase or reduction of the number of free electrons
in the plasma through the charge neutrality condition.
We obtained a pump wave with spatial variation trans-
verse to the background magnetic ﬁeld, which contained
an upper and lower branch, and made the approxima-
tion of spatial uniformity of this pump. The stability of
this structure was investigated by perturbing the pump
wave, as we looked for parametric instabilities wherein
the pump wave generates excited waves. Three natural
transverse modes were found to be excited propagating
parallel to the background magnetic ﬁeld; two left handed
when the second species is positive and two right handed
when the second species is negative. Two out of each of
these three are the modiﬁed fast and slow (ion-cyclotron)
modes. There were three basic types of interactions al-
lowed; left-right, left-left and right-right, each of which
has several combinations dependent on both the choice
of branch from the pump wave (upper and lower) and
the choice of natural mode (slow and fast), giving rise to
twelve interactions in total for any particular plasma.

We derived the frequency changes to the natural
modes, corresponding to growth rates when the perturba-
tion to the frequency was imaginary. We can summarize
the main features of the instabilities for the left–right
interactions (opposite sense circular polarization) as fol-
lows:

(i) Of the four combinations allowed, three are unstable
when the number density of the second massive species
is substantial, and all four are unstable when the number
density of the second massive species is low.

(iii) In contrast to the left–right interactions, the upper
pump mode can give the strongest instabilities. The U sf
interaction has a large growth rate between ωc and 2ωc
in the positive second species case, and at higher values
of pump frequency in the negative second species case.

In several of the above interactions the growth rate
starts at a nonzero value. This occurs in the cases where
the starting value of ω0 have a corresponding nonzero
value for k0, so the velocity derivative terms are nonzero.

A possibility for further work would be to allow the ex-
cited waves to be fully oblique, rather than simply par-
allel to the background magnetic ﬁeld. In doing so we
would be able to remove the long pump wavelength as-
sumption, which may lead to interesting features. In the
single ion case this was treated in Ref. [11], albeit with-
out pressure. It is anticipated that implementation of the
accompanying additional wavenumber matching rules, in
both the z and x directions, would be algebraically com-
plicated.

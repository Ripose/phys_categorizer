The interaction of intense fs laser pulses with thin foils that have an imposed deformation is
compared with thick targets that develop bow shocks. Both target types yield good absorption.
Up to 80% absorption is obtained for a 0.2µm thick, 15 times over-dense foil at 4 · 1018W/cm2.
A value of 50% is obtained for a 4µm thick, 2 times over-dense thick target at 1018W/cm2. For
comparable extension and curvature of the laser-plasma interfaces absorption levels in both targets
become similar. In both absorption scales weakly with intensity and density. Energy transport in
thin foils and thick targets, however, is diﬀerent.

Absorption of super-intense laser pulses in solids is based on collective mechanisms like the Brunel eﬀect [1,2],
anomalous skin eﬀect [3,4], or j × B-heating [5] with continuous transitions from one to the other and wide overlaps
among them. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) and Vlasov simulations in one dimension (1D) have shown that absorption varies
between 5 − 15% at normal incidence to at most 60% at about 75◦ incidence for irradiances not exceeding several
1017Wcm−2µm2 [6]. Beyond this intensity emission of harmonics and eﬀects of self-generated dc magnetic ﬁelds
lead to a reduction of this maximum, as well as its shift towards smaller angles of incidence and , eventually, to the
formation of secondary relative maxima in the angular absorption behaviour [7]. The signature of collective absorption
is the generation of jets of fast electrons in the relativistic domain. Owing to E−3/2 energy scaling of the collision
frequency, collisional absorption becomes ineﬃcient at irradiances Iλ2 ≥ 1017Wcm−2µm2 [8,9].

All beam photon conversion into fast electrons occurs over skin lengths ls ≈ c/ωp much less than a vacuum
wavelength λ, simply because the free electron current induced by the laser ﬁeld always tends to cancel the incident
ﬁeld [10]. If so, absorption is bounded to the thin critical layer. However, the question arises whether the geometry
of the interaction region is a sensitive parameter for the degree of absorption. So far this problem has never been
investigated systematically. The question to which degree absorption can increase in deformed targets and whether
thin plasma layers already lead to good absorption is an interesting problem in itself, e.g. for better understanding
the relevant interaction physics, as well as it is essential for applications. Three substantial applications in which good
absorption is highly desirable are (i) the generation of collimated intense jets of energetic electrons, (ii) broad-band
intense X-ray sources in thin foils (for instance for back-lighting), and (iii) the fast igniter scheme for ICF [11].

The problems addressed can be reduced to the following three questions: (i) How does absorption change when
target deformation is naturally present due to bow shocks and hole boring or when it is imposed as for corrugated
targets? (ii) What is the energy current dynamics (eﬃciency into forward and lateral directions) in such targets? (iii)
Is there a diﬀerence between thin and thick targets? To answer these questions we make use of 2D2P (two spatial
and two momentum components) Vlasov simulations for reasons of low noise and high resolution. We will show laser
light absorption enhancement up to 80% and high levels of transparency in thin deformed foils, lateral deﬂection of
main electron jet streams, and the formation of a well collimated axial jet in thick targets. Finally, the occurrence
and relevance of Weibel type instabilities and self-generated current ﬁlaments will be presented and discussed.

In our simulations all physical variables depend on the spatial variables x and y.

In addition, the distribution
functions for the ions and electrons depend on two momentum coordinates px and py. A 350 × 128 × 51 × 51 grid
for the electrons and a 350 × 128 × 41 × 41 grid for the ions is used. Use is made of a charge conservative numerical
scheme.

In order to better show how energy absorption and transport are related to the target deformation, ﬁrst we consider
a preformed plasma layer with an imposed Gaussian deformation in lateral direction. The deformation is given by

x(y) = δ exp (cid:0)−(y − y0)2/γ2(cid:1) where x(y) denotes the longitudinal position of the peak density, δ the deformation
depth as indicated in plot (a) of Fig. 1, and γ the deformation width. We take for the radial beam diameter 5µm
at full-width-half-maximum and for γ = 3.8 µm. For δ we use 0, 1, 2 µm in our simulations. For the thickness of the
plasma layer we take d = 0.2µm. After a ﬁnite rise time the laser beam intensity is kept constant. The transverse
locations y0 for the peak of the pulse and the center of the deformation coincide.

Fractional absorption of the laser energy as a function of time is presented in plot (b) of Fig. 1. Both, deformed
and planar target data are plotted. Absorption starts to rise at t ≈ 20fs, and tends to saturate at t ≈ 80fs. The
saturation values are between 40% and 80%. Absorption in the deformed thin foils investigated in our simulations are
well above those predicted for planar plasma ﬁlms or thick targets [12] for comparable parameters. Simulations for
ne/nc = 8 and lower intensities but equal deformations yield minor discrepancies for the absorption values. Hence,
we ﬁnd that absorption depends only weakly on density and intensity.

To address electron transport we look at the mass and energy currents in the thin deformed plasma layers. Plots (a)
- (d) of Fig. 2 show iso-contours of the electron energy currents ǫx and ǫy, and the electron distribution projections
fe(y, px) and fe(y, py) where we have integrated over variables not indicated in the arguments. The distribution
functions are obtained from a diﬀerent simulation with ne/nc = 20. Counter-propagating lateral energy currents are
found in front of the foil. As time proceeds the lateral part streaming out of the center grows. This is observed from
the distribution function fe(y, py) which has slow and fast electrons ﬂowing in diﬀerent lateral directions. Here, the
energy current out of the center already dominates. We ﬁnd that the function fe(y, py) does not become quasi-steady.
In opposition, fe(y, px) acquires a quasi-steady state. In that sense absorption in thin plasma layers is due to lateral
energy ﬂow.

Plots (a), (b), and (c) of Fig. 3 show the quasi-steady electron mass currents and magnetic ﬁeld. The mass current
ﬂows into the center and is balanced by a lateral return current (see plot (b)). Small scale ﬁlaments are present in
the center of the foil. The magnetic ﬁeld ﬁlaments saturate at 16MG. Combining plots (a) and (b) we observe that
the gyro-radius of the electron current after saturation is close to the local classical skin length ls = c/ωp ≈ 0.08µm.
The structure and scale-lengths of the magnetic ﬁeld and current patterns are consistent with those generated by a
nonlinear Weibel instability [13] driven by the magnetic repulsion of counter-propagating charged electron beams. As
is seen from plot (a) of Fig. 2 the fast electron population does not contribute to the growth of the ﬁlamentations
since the longitudinal energy current is always positive (hence no mutual repulsion but collimation of fast electrons).
We now look at simulations for thick, weakly over-dense plasma foils for which we let the deformation be generated
by the radiation pressure of the short pulse itself. We take 5µm at full-width-half-maximum for the radial beam
diameter. For the thickness of the plasma layer we take d = 4µm while the density is ne/nc = 2. After a ﬁnite rise
time the laser beam intensity is kept constant. Plots (a) - (c) of Fig. 4 show results from a simulation of a thick
foil of hydrogen ions. A collisionless quasi-steady bow shock is generated [14] with a shock speed of approximately
107m/s. The high shock speed generates a quasi-steady magnetic wake behind the shock-vacuum interface. The ion
shock yields a deformed laser-plasma interface with δ ≈ 0.5µm. Fractional absorption is about 50% which agrees
with the values obtained from the foil simulations with comparable deformation. We note that the density at the
shock front is now much lower (≈ 3nc). At the shock interface fast electrons in longitudinal and lateral directions
are generated as in plots (a) and (b) of Fig. 2 and schematically indicated in Fig. 5. The energy currents ǫx and
ǫy are of similar magnitude. In opposition to the thin foil case, however, fast lateral electrons are now captured by
the magnetic ﬁeld and penetrate deeply into the plasma in front of the shock. There, they generate a magnetic ﬁeld
[14] which further collimates electrons (see Fig.4(b)). Looking at the energy currents in the plasma we observe that
almost the total deposited laser ﬂux is converted into fast longitudinal electrons that propagate in the channel. For
reasons of quasi-neutrality a return mass current is drawn (see Fig. 4(c)).

Instabilities may prevent the evolution of a symmetric magnetic channel along pulse propagation direction due to
vacuum-plasma interface distortion and bending of the magnetic channel. However, high shock speeds and small laser
diameters help to avoid the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities due to fast mass replacement by fast lateral
ablation (ablative stabilisation). Filamentation instabilities are expected to be more relevant (see plots (a) and (b) of
Fig. 3 for the case of thin foils). For counter-propagating, overlapping currents of similar magnitude they grow close
to ωp [13]. However, the energy current in the channel is unidirectional since it is not balanced by an energy return
current (the fast electron population is not balanced). Hence, it has a collimating eﬀect on the mass current. This
eﬀect can be veriﬁed by imposing mirror reﬂecting boundary conditions. Now the energy current is balanced and we
do not obtain a magnetic channel but magnetic bubbles (ﬁlamentation) in the plasma [15].

To summarize our numerical results, we have related laser deposition and target geometry. Thin and thick foils
both yield a substantial increase of short pulse absorption for moderate target deformation. For comparable lateral
extension and curvature of the laser-plasma interfaces we have obtained similar levels of laser deposition (≈ 50%),
no matter whether the deformation has been natural or imposed. We have found that absorption depends weakly on

2

density and intensity but strongly on the shape of the interface. In both, thin and thick deformed targets fast electrons
propagating into the center of the curved laser-plasma interface are generated. However, in thin plasma layers fast
electrons cannot escape from the foil and thus heat the plasma in lateral direction. For thick foils with comparable
lateral extension and curvature of the laser-plasma interface the fast electrons are captured and collimated by a
magnetic ﬁeld that extends deep into the plasma and enhances the penetration depth of the electrons. The plasma
is now heated in pulse propagation direction. A high fraction of the total deposited laser ﬂux is converted into
longitudinal electron energy current.

We note that there are experimental indications for both transport mechanisms. In the experiment of Feurer et al.
[16] evidence for signiﬁcant laser-induced surface modiﬁcation is given; at the same time, absorption is high (≈ 45%).
Measurements also suggest the existence of two electron populations, one with an energy of ≈ 400keV and another
with a few tens of keV, but velocity mostly parallel to the target surface. This is similar to what is found in our
simulations (see plot (c) and (d) in Fig.2). Comparison of our simulations with the experimental results suggest that
both, high absorption and transversely ﬂowing electrons are related to the surface deformation.

Tatarakis et al. [17] observe a collimated plasma jet emitted from the rear of a thick solid density target. Their
interferometric measurements show that the laser interacts with an expanding plasma with a longitudinal extension
of some µm. Therefore the interaction conditions are similar to our thick target simulations. These latter support
the conclusion by Tatarakis et al. that the fast electrons are collimated by magnetic ﬁelds.

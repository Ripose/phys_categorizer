Diodes used in most high power devices are inherently open. We show that under such circum-
stances, there is a loss of electromagnetic radiation leading to a lower critical current as compared
to closed diodes. We argue that the power loss can be incorporated in the standard Child-Langmuir
framework by introducing an eﬀective potential. The modiﬁed Child-Langmuir law can be used
to predict the maximum power loss for a given plate separation and potential diﬀerence as well
as the maximum transmitted current for this power loss. The eﬀectiveness of the theory is tested
numerically.

The motion of charged particles accelerated across a
gap is of considerable interest in ﬁelds such as high power
diodes and vacuum microelectronics. There are two pos-
sible mechanisms that lead to a saturation in the trans-
mitted current. One, in which the voltage diﬀerence is
increased till all the charges that are produced at the
cathode, are transmitted. The other, where the voltage
is held ﬁxed and the charges produced at the cathode are
made to increase (e.g. by increasing the temperature in
a thermionic diode or by increasing the power of a laser
in case of a photocathode).
Interestingly, a saturation
is observed even in the second case and the current is
said to be space charge limited. A useful approximation
for the amount of current ﬂowing in such cases is the
Child-Langmuir expression for transmitted current be-
tween two inﬁnite parallel plates. For electrodes having
a potential diﬀerence V and separated by a distance D,
the Child-Langmuir current density is expressed as [1–3]

JCL(1) =

V 3/2

where e is the magnitude of the charge and m0 the rest
mass of an electron. In 1-dimensional situations (plate
dimension much larger than their separation), this is also
the current density at which some electrons, instead of
moving towards the anode, return to the cathode due to
mutual repulsion (space charge eﬀect). This is referred
to as critical current density.

In 2-dimensions, analytical and numerical studies [4–6]
indicate that the critical current is somewhat higher than
the Child-Langmuir expression and is given by [4,6]

for inﬁnite plates with a ﬁnite emission area. Here W is
the width of the emission strip, D is the anode-cathode

The picture presented above is considerably simpliﬁed
as it is based on electrostatic analysis. Nonetheless, it
suﬃces when the diode is closed. In reality, as the current
starts ﬂowing, electromagnetic radiation is emitted. In
a closed cavity, the emitted radiation opposes the ﬂow
of electrons in the region near the cathode while in the
region towards the anode, it enhances the acceleration
due to the applied ﬁeld [7]. Thus, electrons regain the
emitted energy from the electromagnetic ﬁeld so that the
net ﬁeld energy attains equilibrium.

Most often however, diodes are “open” due to the pres-
ence of either a mesh anode (such as in a vircator) or
insulating dielectrics in the pulse forming line of the cav-
ity diode or a dielectric window as in a photocathode.
This results in a loss of electromagnetic radiation. The
electrons are thus unable to reabsorb all the emitted ra-
diation and hence acquire a lower energy on reaching
the anode as compared to the case of a closed diode.
This also leads to a drop in transmitted current due to
the enhanced repulsion between the slowly moving elec-
trons. Thus, diodes open to electromagnetic radiation
cannot be governed by any of the above Child-Langmuir
laws. Interestingly, there are several instances where de-
viations from the Child-Langmuir law have been observed
[8–10]. In cases where the current measured is consid-
erably higher, modiﬁcations to the Child-Langmuir law
take into account the expansion of the plasma formed
at the cathode. This leads to a decrease in the anode-
cathode separation [8,9] with time, t. The separation
D in eq. (1) is thus replaced by D − vt where v is the
plasma expansion rate [9]. Transmitted currents lower
than the Child-Langmuir law have also been observed.
On completion of this work, we were made aware of such
a case in experiments using photocathode. An explana-
tion put forward for this observation takes into account
the impedance of the plasma formed at the cathode so

that the voltage V in eq. (1) is replaced by V − ZI where
I is the current (JA where A is the emitter area) and Z
is the plasma impedance [10,9]. However, comparisons
with actual measurements of impedance were not made
and the problem may thus be considered open. The form
of this modiﬁed law (replacing V by V − ZI) is however
general enough to account for any loss mechanism and
the one that we propose here due to leakage of electro-
magnetic radiation can also be expressed in such a form.
While we are not aware of direct measurements of power
loss in a diode, it is our hope nonetheless that the modi-
ﬁcation that we propose serves to explain some of the de-
viations from the standard Child-Langmuir law observed
in experimental situations.

We shall ﬁrst demonstrate numerically that there is
indeed a leakage of electromagnetic radiation and a drop
in transmitted current in open diodes. We shall there-
after show how the Child-Langmuir can be modiﬁed to
account for the loss of energy due to the leakage of elec-
tromagnetic radiation.

FIG. 1. A schematic of the diode. The dark patch on the
cathode plate is the emission area. The ﬁgure at the bottom
shows the diode in z-r plane as modelled in XOOPIC.

Consider a cavity diode as shown in ﬁg. 1. It consists of
a cathode plate with emission from a part of the cathode
plate (the dark region in ﬁg. 1), an anode plate and an
outer cavity wall. The gap between the cathode plate
and the cavity wall is the “open window” through which
radiation leaks out. We shall consider here a cathode-
anode separation, D = 8 mm, the radius of the cavity
wall RW = 12.5 cm, the radius of the circular emission
strip R = 3.5 cm and the applied voltage on the cathode-
plate V = −250 kV (the other parts of the diode are
grounded). The radius of cathode plate, RCP varies from
4 cm to 12.5 cm, the last corresponding to a closed diode.
For the closed geometry, eq. (1) predicts JCL(1) ≃ 4.57
MA/m2 while eq. (3) gives JCL(2) ≃ 4.83 MA/m2. For
a beam radius of 3.5 cm, the corresponding currents are
17.58 KA and 18.58 KA respectively.

Our numerical studies have been carried out us-
ing the fully electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code
XOOPIC version 2.51 b(c) [12,13] and veriﬁed using a
suitably modiﬁed form of the electromagnetic PIC code
SPIFFE 2.3 [14]. The modiﬁcation in SPIFFE takes into

account open boundaries by applying ﬁrst order Mur type
boundary conditions [15].

The results we present here have been obtained using
XOOPIC. In the input ﬁle, the cavity wall and anode
plate are considered as “conductors” while the cathode
plate at the “beam emitter (VarWeightBeamEmitter or
FieldEmitter)” is an “equipotential”. At the open win-
dow, an “exitport” is used to evaluate the power emitted
through it. The number of mesh points in azimuthal and
radial directions are typically 100 and 250 while the time
step ∆t = 2 × 10−13s. The number of particles emitted
per time step varies between 200 and 700 depending on
the current.

For each opening, we increase the injected current till
the transmitted current attains (quasi) saturation [16,11].
We then record the transmitted current and the power
emitted through the open window.

FIG. 2. The transmitted current IT R (KA) is plotted
against the opening RW −RCP (cm). The transmitted current
decreases monotonically as the opening is increased.

Fig. 2 shows a plot of the transmitted current density
as a function of the opening RW − RCP . There is a
monotonic decrease as the window opening increases. In
ﬁgure 3, we plot the power emitted through the window
as a function of the opening RW −RCP . The power peaks
at RW − RCP = 2.5 cm or RCP = 10 cm.

To understand the relation between the area of the
open window and the emitted power, it should ﬁrst be
noted that the emitted power is zero for a closed diode
(RW − RCP = 0) even though the electromagnetic ﬁeld
energy inside the diode is high. As the opening increases,
some of this ﬁeld energy leaks out. Thus the emitted
power increases, the current drops and the ﬁeld energy
inside reduces as the opening is increased. However, at
very large openings, most of the emitted radiation leaks
out. Consequently, the transmitted current and hence
the ﬁeld energy inside the diode must be small. Thus,
even though the window area is large, the power emitted
must be small. It follows that at a critical value of the
opening, the ﬁeld energy inside, transmitted current and
window area are such that the power emitted is at a
maximum as observed in ﬁg. 3.

2

We thus ﬁnd that the transmitted current decreases
with an increase in window area while the emitted power
peaks as the window area is increased from zero and then
decreases for larger openings [17]. An exact theory pre-
dicting such a behaviour is rather formidable and shall
not be attempted here. However, in the following, we
shall argue how the power loss can be incorporated within
the Child-Langmuir framework.

In a closed geometry, the average power transferred
to the electrons is IT RV where IT R is the average trans-
mitted current. The leakage of electromagnetic radiation
through the open window eﬀectively results in a power
loss. If Prad is the radiative power loss through the win-
dow, the eﬀective average power transferred to the elec-
trons is IT RV − Prad. Alternately, one may imagine that
the diode is closed but the eﬀective applied voltage is
Vef f = V − Prad/IT R.

(4)

In writing eq. (4), it is assumed that the rate of change
in ﬁeld energy inside the diode is negligible compared to
the power leaking out. This is borne out numerically by
the saturation in ﬁeld energy inside the diode.

Note that eq. (6) does not allow us to read oﬀ the
transmitted current given the potential diﬀerence, plate
separation and area of the open window. Rather, it de-
pends on the power of the radiation emitted through the
open window, a quantity that is unknown a priori. How-
ever, eq. (6) does contain relevant information in the form
of the maximum power emitted through the window and
the transmitted current at this power (or opening) as we
show below.

For the geometry under consideration, eq. (6) takes

the form

I 5
T R = 1.9799 × 104 α2

g (V IT R − Prad)3

(7)

where Prad is measured in gigawatts, V in megavolts and
IT R in kiloamperes. The number of allowed solutions of
eq. (7) depends on the power emitted. In ﬁg. 4, we plot

f (I) = I 5 − 1.9799 × 104 α2

g (V I − P )3

(8)

with αg = 1.057 and V = 0.25 MV for three distinct
values of the power P . For P less than the critical power
Pc = 0.864 GW, there are two positive roots. These
roots merge at P = Pc while for P > Pc, there is no
positive root. Thus, there is a limit on the maximum
power that can be emitted through the window and the
corresponding transmitted current can be obtained.

FIG. 4. The function f (I) in eq. (8) plotted as a function of
the transmitted current I for three diﬀerent values of the emit-
ted power P . For P = 0.75, there are 2 positive roots while
at P = 0.864 the two positive roots merge. For P > 0.864
there are no positive roots. The inset shows a blow up of the
portion where the three curves appear to meet. None of the
curves however crosses the x-axis.

In ﬁgure 5, we plot the power emitted as a function
of the transmitted current as obtained numerically us-
ing XOOPIC. These are denoted by solid squares. The
dashed curve is a plot of the same using the modiﬁed
Child-Langmuir law of eq. (7). The agreement between
the two is good. Note that the emitted power is zero ei-
ther when the diode is closed and the current is maximum
or when the current is zero.

[16] For open diodes studied here, the transmitted current
attains quasi-saturation with increase in injected cur-
rent. The minor deviations observed may be ascribed to
convergence errors. For closed cavity diode, it has been
demonstrated that the transmitted current saturates only
asymptotically with injected current [11].

[17] A similar behaviour of “power loss” is observed in case
a resistive load, applied across an inﬁnite parallel plate
drift space, is varied. See for instance ﬁg. 3.12b of [3] or
R. R. Puri, R. Kumar and D. Biswas, Theory of Vircator
I - One Dimensional Models, BARC/2002/I/022 (2002).

Finally, we have used diﬀerent D/R ratios and also
diﬀerent voltages to study the Child-Langmuir law mod-
iﬁed due to leakage of electromagnetic radiation. The
agreement with eq. 6 is good in general. We have also
used a dielectric window (with low ǫ such as in materials
like Perspex) followed by an exit port. This results in a
marginal drop in power emitted and the modiﬁed Child-
Langmuir agrees with our simulations. Details of these
studies will be reported elsewhere.

FIG. 5. A plot of the power (GW) leaking through the win-
dow as a function of the transmitted current (KA) calculated
using XOOPIC (solid squares) and the Child-Langmuir law
modiﬁed by the eﬀective voltage and the geometric factor.

We have thus shown that an opening in a diode (such
as due to the presence of dielectrics) acts as an exit port
for the emitted radiation and results in a drop in the
transmitted current. The power loss can be accomodated
within the Child-Langmuir framework by introducing an
eﬀective voltage and the resulting modiﬁed law is in ex-
cellent agreement with PIC simulations using the code
XOOPIC. It is our hope that in experimental situations
where leakage of radiation can occur, an analysis in this
new light helps to explain deviations from the standard
Child-Langmuir law.

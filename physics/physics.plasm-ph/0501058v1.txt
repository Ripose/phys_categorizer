Abstract

The Rosenbluth form for the collision operator for a weakly relativistic plasma is derived. The for-
malism adopted by Antonsen and Chu can then be used to calculate the efﬁciency of current drive by
fast waves in a relativistic plasma. Accurate numerical results and analytic asymptotic limits for the
efﬁciencies are given.

INTRODUCTION

Currents may be efﬁciently generated in a plasma by the injection of rf waves whose phase velocities
are several times the electron thermal speed.1 The efﬁciency, deﬁned as the ratio of current generated to
power dissipated, is achieved in this instance because the rf-generated plateau decays at a rate given by
the collision frequency for the fast electrons, which is relatively low. In the quest for higher efﬁciencies,
current drive by waves which interact with relativistic electrons has also been considered.2 Relativistic
effects modify the scaling of the efﬁciency, placing an upper bound on the efﬁciency achievable by current
drive by fast waves. In this paper, we do several things: we give a more complete analysis of this problem
based on a formalism adopted by Antonsen and Chu.3 Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the effect of ﬁnite
electron temperature leads to an enhancement of the efﬁciency. In order to calculate this effect, we ﬁrst
give expressions for the most important terms in the electron-electron collision integral in the relativistic
limit. These expressions are put in Rosenbluth form so as to be amenable to easy implementation on a
computer. We imagine that the relativistic Rosenbluth potentials that we identify may be useful in other
problems arising in very hot plamas.

In order to put the present work in perspective, let us brieﬂy review the chief tools used in the study
of current drive. The early work used fairly crude analytical models.1,4 These models were sufﬁcient
to obtain the scaling laws for the efﬁciency of current drive, but were unable to provide the coefﬁcients
with any accuracy. Therefore, the analytical treatment was supplemented by numerical solutions to the
two-dimensional (in momentum space) Fokker–Planck equation,5–8 from which accurate estimates of the
efﬁciency could be found. The ﬁrst accurate analytical treatment of current drive was based on a Langevin
formulation of the electron motion.2,9 This involved taking the electron temperature to be small, allowing
energy scattering to be ignored. The moment hierarchy for the Langevin equations can then be closed,
which allows an analytical solution to be obtained. This was followed by a more complete numerical
study of the Fokker–Planck equation for current drive in which the problem was reduced to the numerical
solution of a one-dimensional integro-differential equation with a source due to the rf.10 In this work
toroidal effects were also included. The results agreed with the Langevin analysis9 in the limit of large
phase velocities (as they should) and gave more accurate numerical data for phase velocities comparable
to or smaller than the thermal velocity. More recently, Antonsen and Chu3 and, independently, Taguchi,11
using methods ﬁrst used in the study of beam-driven currents,12,13 recognized that it is not necessary to
solve the rf-driven Fokker–Planck equation in order to ﬁnd the rf-induced current. Instead, they showed
that the Green’s function for the current is the Spitzer–H¨arm function14 describing the perturbed electron
distribution in the presence of an electric ﬁeld. This reduces the problem to the determination of a single
two-dimensional function, from which the current generated by any form of rf drive can be calculated by
a simple integration.

≫

Up until now, the only reliable analytical results for current drive in a relativistic plasma are those
mec2
obtained using the Langevin methods by Ref. 2. As we will show, these are only exact for Te ≪
and p2
meTe (where p is the momentum of the resonant electrons). A more complete analytical or
numerical treatment along the lines of that achieved in the nonrelativistic case was hampered by the lack
of a convenient form for the relativistic collision operator. This is remedied to some extent by the results
of this paper where we calculate the collision integrals for the ﬁrst Legendre harmonic of the perturbed
electron distribution neglecting electromagnetic effects on the binary interaction (in this approximation
the collision integral reduces to the Landau form). Having done this, we are able to generalize the
treatment of Antonsen and Chu3 to the relativistic case. A number of useful results ﬂow from this: we
can numerically calculate to high precision the current-drive efﬁciencies in the relativistic regime. We
can perform an asymptotic analysis of the Spitzer–H¨arm problem to obtain analytic approximations to
the efﬁciencies. In addition, we give higher-order asymptotic corrections to the current-drive efﬁciencies
in the nonrelativistic limit. Throughout this paper, toroidal effects are entirely ignored. Although these
effects are important in the study of current drive by low-phase-velocity waves, they play little role in

2

current drive by fast waves. Incorporation of these effects, however, proceeds in exact analogy with the
treatment for the nonrelativistic case.3

Relativistic effects on rf current drive have also been considered by Hizanidis and Bers.15 They take
moments of the kinetic equation. In order to close the resulting system of equations, they approximate the
steady-state electron distribution by a delta function. This approximation is unjustiﬁed and, consequently,
their results for the current-drive efﬁciency are incorrect.

The plan of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II we show how the relativistic collision operator may be
reduced to the Landau form. In this form, the collision operator is costly to evaluate numerically. So, in
Sec. III we convert the collision integrals to a Rosenbluth form, which may be evaluated very efﬁciently.
The formulation of Antonsen and Chu is generalized to the relativistic case in Sec. IV. The numerical
results for the efﬁciencies are given in Sec. V and the asymptotic results in Sec. VI. Finally, in Sec. VII,
we examine the asymptotic form of the efﬁciencies using the full relativistic collision operator.

Since the original form for U was symmetric in the primed and unprimed variables, we could equally

well have obtained Eq. (1c) under the assumption that βa ≪
and (2) is O(β′
b). However, the error in the collision operator C(fa, fb) is smaller than this. This point
is examined in more detail in Sec. VII. Equations (1) are precisely the collision operator given by Lan-
dau.17 Indeed an examination of his derivation shows that the mechanics of the collisions are treated
relativistically; the interaction, however, is calculated nonrelativistically assuming a Coulomb potential.
Use of Landau collision operator implies a neglect of the relativistic (i.e., electromagnetic) effects on the
binary interaction. What we have shown here is that such an approximation is valid provided at least one
of the colliding particles is nonrelativistic.

III. GENERALIZATION OF THE ROSENBLUTH POTENTIALS

For computational purposes, the Landau operator is not the most convenient form for the collision
operator. If the plasma is azimuthally symmetric, a two-dimensional integration must be performed at

This requirement is dramatically reduced in the nonrelativistic case by expressing the collision operator
in terms of Rosenbluth potentials.18 Unfortunately, although the Landau operator can be used without
change to describe the collisions in a relativistic Coulomb plasma, the Rosenbluth form no longer applies.

However, because the kernel of the collision integral Eq. (1c) has the same form as in the nonrela-
tivistic case, it is possible to borrow some of the techniques of Ref. 18. We convert the p′ integration in
Eq. (1b) to v′ space, substitute a particular Legendre component for f (p′), and manipulate the resulting

which may be evaluated in the same way as Rosenbluth potentials18 (Pk is a Legendre polynomial).

Here we give the resulting expressions for collisions off a stationary Maxwellian background, i.e.,
C(f, fm), and for collisions of a Maxwellian off the ﬁrst Legendre component of a background, i.e.,
C(fm, µf1).
In both cases only electron-electron collisions are considered. These terms are all that
are required for the solution of the Spitzer–H¨arm problem (giving the Green’s function for the rf current
drive) and they sufﬁce for an accurate numerical solution of the two-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation
as described in Sec. V.

Beginning with the case of collisions off a Maxwellian, let us start by assuming merely that the
background is isotropic f (p) = f0(p). The three-dimensional integrals in Eq. (1b) then reduce to one-

These frequencies differ by a factor of two from those used in earlier publications.1,2,5,6,8,9 Speciﬁcally,
we have νt = ν0/2 and νc = ν/2. This means that all our normalized efﬁciencies are a factor of
two smaller than in these earlier papers. (We made this change because the normalized Fokker–Planck
equation in the high-energy limit now has a simpler form. This convention is also used by other workers
in this ﬁeld.)

angle scattering is negligible compared with frictional slowing down. This is to be contrasted with the
nonrelativistic case where the pitch-angle scattering frequency and the frictional slowing-down rate decay
as 1/p2 and the two processes are of comparable importance.

The implication for current drive is that the efﬁciency of parallel wave-induced ﬂuxes, say by lower-
hybrid waves, approaches a constant. This can be seen as follows: Nonrelativistically, the efﬁciency
increases as p2. Relativistic electrons, however, slow down faster because they are heavier, and they
also do not carry more current when pushed in the parallel direction. Each of these effects reduces the
efﬁciency by γ

p; hence the approach to a constant.

The other term we shall need is C(fm, µf1). This term is rather harder to compute. We deﬁne
f1(p) = fm(p)χ1(p) and write C(fm, µfmχ1) = µfmI(χ1). Again, we reduce (this time after much
algebra) the integrals in Eq. (1b) to one-dimensional ones to give

The term in square brackets in the last integral matches that in the ﬁrst integral except for the interchange
of the primed and unprimed variables. The simpliﬁcation of Eq. (7) was achieved, in part, with the help
of the symbolic manipulation program, MACSYMA.22

Equations (4) and (7) are now in a computationally convenient form. Their evaluation involves the
determination of a number of indeﬁnite integrals (the unprimed variables should be factored out of the
integrals for this step), and the multiplication of these integrals by various functions of p. If the distribu-
tion functions are known on a grid of N points, then the computational cost is just O(N ). Furthermore,
the calculation can be arranged so that nearly all the computations vectorize.23 The general solution of
the linearized electron-electron collision operator C(f, fm) + C(fm, f ) = 0 is

IV. FORMULATION

We now turn to the calculation of the rf efﬁciency. There are three steps involved: the speciﬁcation of
the rf current-drive problem, the identiﬁcation of the Spitzer–H¨arm function as the Green’s function for
the rf-driven current; and the solution of the Spitzer–H¨arm problem.

We begin with the speciﬁcation of the problem. This is just a standard application of the Chapman–
Enskog procedure.24 The most important assumption is that the collisional time scale is much shorter
than the transport time scale (the time scale for heating the plasma by the rf). This places some restrictions
on the rf drive. However, these are usually not severe ones in the case of fast-wave current drive because,
even if the rf is strong, there are few resonant particles and, consequently, the heating rate is small.

The effect of the rf is to induce an electron ﬂux

·

in momentum space, where D is the quasilinear diffusion tensor.25 In the Chapman–Enskog ordering
this is taken to be of ﬁrst order. The zeroth-order electron distribution is given by setting the collision
term C(f, f ) + C(f, fi) equal to zero. The general solution is a Maxwellian Eq. (5) with n and T
arbitrary functions of time and position. For simplicity we ignore the spatial variations. Since the rf
drive is particle conserving, we may take n to be a constant. A drifting Maxwellian does not solve the
zeroth-order system since the ions are taken to be stationary.

The ﬁrst-order equation is given by substituting f = fm(1 + ψ) with ψ ordered small to give

The last term in Eq. (9) represents the heating of the Maxwellian. The equation for the time evolution of

In the nonrelativistic limit, Eq. (9) is the equation solved numerically by Cordey et al.10 However,

since we are usually interested primarily in the current density generated by the rf

and the efﬁciency of current generation deﬁned by the ratio J/P , we usually do not need to know the full
solution for ψ.

The method for determining the current without solving for ψ was given by Hirshman12 and by
Taguchi13 for neutral-beam-driven currents and was introduced into the study of rf-driven currents by
Antonsen and Chu3 and Taguchi.11 The key is to deﬁne an “adjoint” problem

Again fmχ is required to have zero density and energy. This is the Spitzer–H¨arm problem for the per-
turbed electron distribution function due to an electric ﬁeld E = T ˆpk. Using the self-adjoint property of
the linearized collision operator

χC(fmψ) d3p, it is readily found that

ψC(fmχ) d3p =

In this equation χ plays the role of a Green’s function for the rf-driven current. The ratio of Eqs. (14) and

The power of these results is that the calculation of J/P does not require a solution of Eq. (9) for the rf
distribution ψ. On the other hand, Eq. (13) must be solved for the Spitzer–H¨arm function χ. This reduces
to the solution of a one-dimensional integro-differential equation, which may be accurately computed.
Furthermore, in the nonrelativistic limit, it has been tabulated.14 This method also substantially reduces
the parameter space to be investigated numerically. The solution of Eq. (13) depends on two parameters
only, Z and Θ. In contrast, the solution of Eq. (9) depends on various parameters specifying the nature
of the rf excitation (for instance, the direction of S, the minimum and maximum phase velocities, etc.) as
well as Z and Θ.

In order to determine the rf current-drive efﬁciency using Eqs. (15) or (16), we must solve the Spitzer–
H¨arm problem, Eq. (13). The solution χ consists of only the ﬁrst Legendre harmonic, so we substitute
χ(p) = µχ1(p) into Eq. (13) giving

where A(p) and B(p) are given by Eq. (4), the electron-ion term is given by Eq. (3), and I(χ1) is given
by Eq. (7). The fact that the solution of Eq. (13) consists of only a single Legendre component constitutes
an additional advantage to this method of determining current-drive efﬁciencies. The solution of the full
rf problem given in Eq. (9) consists, in general, of many Legendre components. Often some truncation is
performed in computing these numerically.

Equation (17) may be solved by approximate analytic methods either by expressing χ as a sum of
Sonine polynomials24,26 or by formulating the equation as a variational problem.12 These methods have
the disadvantage that they generally fail to reproduce the correct asymptotic (large p) form for χ. This
failing does not affect the calculation of the electrical conductivity signiﬁcantly since in that case χ is
integrated with a weighting factor proportional to fm. However, it rules out such methods for the study
of rf current drive, since the efﬁciency may depend on the local value of χ.

This leaves us either with asymptotic methods, which we apply in Sec. VI, or with numerical methods.
Numerical solutions to Eq. (17) have been given in the nonrelativistic case in Refs. 14 and 27. Here we
use a simpler method that avoids most of the problems with the application of boundary conditions. We
cast Eq. (17) as a one-dimensional diffusion equation by setting the left-hand side to ∂χ1/∂t and solve
this diffusion equation until a steady state is reached. (The initial conditions may be chosen arbitrarily.)
The integration is carried out in the domain 0 < p < pmax and the boundary conditions χ(0) = 0 and
χ′′(pmax) = 0 are imposed. The diffusion equation describes the physical problem of the evolution of
the perturbed electron distribution in the presence of an electric ﬁeld and is therefore guaranteed to give
the correct solution of Eq. (13) without having to worry about spurious solutions that diverge at p = 0 or
. Since this is a one-dimensional diffusion equation, it may be solved by treating the differential

operator fully implicitly (the time step may be taken to be large). The integral operator I(χ1) is treated
explicitly and is recomputed after every time step. In the calculations shown here, the momentum step
size was taken to be pt/50, the time step was taken to be 1000/νt, and the process converged (i.e., the
relative change in χ1 per step was less than 1 part in 1010) after about 50 steps.

In the following sections we will also need the function G(p) = χ1(p)/p so that χ(p) = pkG(p). In

terms of G, the gradient of χ is

χ(p) = G(p)ˆpk + pkGp(p)ˆp,

where Gp(p) = dG(p)/dp.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The solution for χ is given as a contour plot in Fig. 1 for Z = 1 and Θ = 0 and 0.01. From these and
a knowledge of S, the direction of the rf-induced current can be determined. In the nonrelativistic case,
Fig. 1(a), χ rises ever more steeply as p is increased, giving the favorable p2 scaling for the current-drive
efﬁciency.9 On the other hand, in a hot plasma, Fig. 1(b), the slope reaches a constant (the contour levels
are equally spaced), leading to a limit in the efﬁciency of the current drive.2

Figure 1 also shows that the contours become vertical for pk small. This indicates that pushing
electrons with small pk in the perpendicular direction (as with cyclotron-damped waves) is not effective
in generating current. Pushing electrons in the parallel direction is effective, especially for small pk, since
the denominator in Eq. (16) can be small. In general, when the contours of constant energy (p = constant)
cross contours of constant χ, the efﬁciency can be very large.

Turning now to the numerical results for the efﬁciency, we begin with the case of a localized spectrum,
Eq. (16). Although this situation may not be realized in practice, it is important because it can help us to
determine the best current-drive schemes by showing where in velocity space to induce the ﬂux. There
are two major classes of fast waves that have been considered for current drive, namely Landau-damped

waves (e.g., lower-hybrid waves) for which ˆS = ˆpk and cyclotron-damped waves for which ˆS = ˆp⊥.

A similar analysis can be performed for a narrow spectrum of cyclotron-damped waves. The situ-
ation is more complicated here because the electron cyclotron frequency depends relativistically on the
momentum28 and because relativistic effects distort the diffusion paths.8 In addition, the variation of the
diffusion coefﬁcient with p⊥ depends on the harmonic number. This means that the efﬁciency depends on
three wave parameters ω/kk, Ω/kk (Ω is the rest-mass cyclotron frequency), and the harmonic number.
We therefore will only treat this case in the nonrelativistic limit.

In the nonrelativistic limit (Θ

0), the efﬁciencies for both kinds of waves have been
calculated by Cordey et al.10 and Taguchi.11 They considered a narrow spectrum of Landau-damped
waves for which the efﬁciency is given by the nonrelativistic limit of Eq. (19) and a narrow spectrum of
cyclotron-damped waves for which the diffusion coefﬁcient is

where the coefﬁcients C are given in Table I. The coefﬁcients for Z = 1 should be compared with the
(less exact) results of Ref. 6 obtained by a numerical solution of the two-dimensional Fokker–Planck



The dependence on Z indicates that the current is unaffected by electron-electron collisions. This result
may be derived by taking the momentum moment of Eq. (13). The electron-electron collision term then
drops out (from momentum conservation) and the electron-ion term is proportional to the numerator in
Eq. (21).

The last numerical example is one in which we relax the condition that f = fm in Eq. (8). This
allows us to ﬁnd the ﬂux S that develops in the presence of high rf power. In order to determine S, we

until a steady state is reached. The numerical collision operator is deﬁned as

Cnum(f ) = C(f, fm) + C(fm, µf1) + C(f, fi),

where µf1 is the ﬁrst Legendre harmonic of f . The electron-ion term C(f, fi) is calculated using Eq. (3).
In order to justify our handling of the electron-electron collisions, let us consider the linearized
electron-electron operator C(f, fm) + C(fm, f ). The ﬁrst term describes the relaxation of the tail par-
ticles on the bulk and the second describes the concomitant heating of the bulk. The linearization is
justiﬁed even with strong rf, as long as f (p)
T . The linearized electron-electron
operator conserves energy, and if this were used in Eq. (22), there would be nothing to balance the power
), and so a steady-state
input by the rf (there is no transfer of energy to the ions in the limit mi → ∞
solution to Eq. (22) would not be possible. In Eq. (9), this is handled by allowing the temperature of the

fm(p) for

Maxwellian to increase slowly with time. In the numerical code, we adopt a different approach, namely
to modify the collision operator so that energy is lost in an innocuous way. The term responsible for the
bulk heating is the second term C(fm, f ). Let us write f in this term as a Legendre harmonic expansion

f (p) =

Pk(µ)fk(p).

∞

Xk=0

Of the terms in this series, only one, the k = 0 term, contributes to the bulk heating.
(The energy
moments of the other terms vanish.) Thus in order to lose energy we drop the term C(fm, f0). Of
the remaining terms in the series, only the ﬁrst, the m = 1 term, is of importance—it is responsible
for ensuring conservation of momentum. Thus we retain only this term and approximate C(fm, f ) by
C(fm, µf1) to give the collision operator Cnum.

The collision operator Cnum has the following properties: energy is not conserved (thus allowing a
steady state to be reached); momentum is conserved; and quantities such as the Spitzer-H¨arm conductiv-
ity, which are given solely in terms of the ﬁrst Legendre harmonic, are correctly given. To justify the way
in which energy conservation is handled, we may check that the results are insensitive to the details of
how this is done. One such check is given below where we compare the efﬁciency given by the numerical
solution of Eq. (22), in which energy is lost, and that given by Eq. (15), where energy is conserved.

We assume that the rf diffusion term in Eq. (22) is caused by high-power lower-hybrid waves whose

phase velocities lie between v1 and v2. Thus we take

This is to be compared with the result given by Eq. (14) with the numerically determined ﬂux S(p),
10−4qnc and J/P = 0.296 q/mcνc. (The ﬁgure for P remains unchanged since this
namely J = 3.77
depends on S alone.) These two sets of ﬁgures are within 1% of each other. The excellent agreement
illustrates two points: the approximations made in the numerical collision operator, namely, the neglect of
the heating term C(fm, f0), has little effect on the results for the current-drive efﬁciencies (discretization
effects are probably a greater source of error in these results); and the analytic result Eq. (15) can be used
to obtain reliable ﬁgures for the efﬁciency for cases of strong rf. What is needed in the latter instance is
an estimate for the rf ﬂux S. This may be found from a numerical solution of a two-dimensional Fokker–
Planck equation (as here) or from an approximate analytical solution. Some saving may be possible using
this method in conjunction with a numerical code: since S reaches a steady state sooner than f , it may not
be necessary to run the code so long in order to obtain a reasonably accurate estimate for the efﬁciency.

VI. ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS

We have seen that the efﬁciency of current drive may be expressed in terms of the solution of the
Spitzer–H¨arm problem, Eq. (17). This equation may be approximately solved in the limit p
pt. We
will begin with the relativistic case and later treat the nonrelativistic limit. We start by writing down the
normalized form of Eq. (17) in the limit p
pt. We chose normalizations based upon q, m, c, and
νc. Thus momenta are normalized to mc, χ1 to qc/νc, J/P to q/mcνc, etc. We use the same symbols
to represent the normalized and unnormalized quantities. The coefﬁcients A(p) and B(p) are given by

VII. HIGH ENERGY LIMIT OF COLLISION OPERATOR

In the previous section, we derived ﬁnite temperature corrections to the efﬁciency limit found in
Ref. 2. However, the collision operator in the Landau form Eqs. (1) was derived by assuming that the
background electrons are only weakly relativistic or that Θ
1. We must check, therefore, that the ﬁnite
Θ corrections to the Landau operator do not affect the formula for the efﬁciency limit Eq. (28).

≪

The linearized collision operator Eq. (10) consists of three collision terms. Since in all practical cases
the ions are nonrelativistic, the ion term C(f, fi) needs no correction. The term C(fm, f ) contributes to
the integral term I(χ1) in Eq. (17). However, this resulted in a O(Θ3/2) contribution to efﬁciency limit
Eq. (28), so that corrections to this term will be of still higher order.

Therefore, we need only consider collisions off a Maxwellian electron background C(f, fm). Fur-
thermore, if Θ is small and if p

approximate U by its Taylor expansion about v′ = 0. By retaining terms up to second order in v′, we

(This calculation was carried out using MACSYMA.22) If we compare these with the equivalent expres-
sions using U from Eq. (1c), we ﬁnd that only the term proportional to β4 is new. The high energy form
of C(f, fm) is given by Eq. (4a) with A(p) given by Eq. (6a), F (p) = (v/T )A(p), and

In other words, in the high-energy limit the electromagnetic correction only changes the pitch-angle
scattering term. The new term has no effect on the asymptotic form for the efﬁciencies Eqs. (27) because
it is smaller by β4 than another term in B, which had no effect.

Connor and Hastie21 also give an expression for collisions of high-energy particles off a ﬁxed back-
ground. The corrections to Eq. (6) that they obtain differ from ours. This is possibly because the back-
ground distribution that they treat is only approximately Maxwellian.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have considered the problem of current drive by fast waves in a relativistic plasma. Let us brieﬂy
review the approximations made. The major one is the reduction of the full collision operator to Landau

15

mc2. The
form. We show in Sec. II that this holds if the background temperature is small, T
corrections to the Landau operator in the high energy limit are derived in Sec. VII and are shown to
be small. The second important approximation is the linearization of the electron-electron collision
operator. This is accurate provided the rf strongly affects only electrons on the tail of the distribution.
The subsequent analysis leading to the formula for the current-drive efﬁciency Eq. (15) is exact. In order
to apply this formula, it is necessary to determine the rf-induced ﬂux S from Eq. (8) and the Spitzer–H¨arm
function χ from Eq. (13).

≪

We considered two methods for computing S: either to assume that f = fm in Eq. (8) (corresponding
to linear damping) or to solve the two-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation, Eq. (22), numerically. The
latter method may be necessary in the case of high rf powers and wide spectra. Note that the efﬁciency
can be accurately calculated even if the S is known only approximately since Eq. (15), being an integral
operator on S, is insensitive to small errors in S. Often, useful information can be extracted from Eq. (15)
even with very limited information about S. If the rf spectrum is known, we can make some estimates
(based on either numerical or approximate analytical solutions to the Fokker–Planck equation) of where
in momentum space the ﬂux is largest. We can then use Eq. (16) to give the efﬁciency.

The Spitzer–H¨arm function χ can be determined by solving Eq. (17) numerically as in Sec. V. Since
this equation is just a one-dimensional equation, there is little difﬁculty in obtaining arbitrarily accurate
results in this way. This method can be regarded as exact. Alternatively, we found asymptotic forms for χ
in Sec. VI. From this we can write down analytical expressions for the current-drive efﬁciency in various
cases as given in Eqs. (27), (28), (30), (31), and (32).

The primary application of this work is, of course, to maintain a steady-state toroidal current in a
tokamak reactor. The viability of this scheme depends upon the amount of circulating power that is
required. Thus, an accurate calculation of the current-drive efﬁciency, as well as an assessment of the
best possible efﬁciency, are of crucial importance.

When applying these results to the study of steady-state current drive in a tokamak, it is useful to
convert the efﬁciency J/P to I/W where I = AJ is the total current, W = 2πRAP is the total rf
power, A is effective poloidal cross-sectional area, and R is the tokamak major radius. This gives

The last two equalities give the conversion from the normalized efﬁciencies given in the ﬁgures and in
Sec. VI to practical units. Figures 2, 3, and 4 contain scales in these units.

The present work calculates the efﬁciency that can be expected from an arbitrary wave-induced ﬂux.
It is possible, therefore, to come to some very general conclusions about the best possible efﬁciency that
can be obtained by driving currents with different waves. In particular, there is a limit, given by Eq. (28),
to the efﬁciency of current drive with fast waves, such as lower-hybrid waves, that interact through a
Landau resonance with relativistic electrons. These waves are, perhaps, the most likely candidate for
current drive in a reactor.

The present calculations also apply to other types of current drive, for example, relativistic electron
beams.29 Here, the efﬁciencies will be similar to those of Landau-damped waves. Care must be taken,
however, in interpreting experiments on relativistic electron beams because the assumption of a steady
state is generally inapplicable.

The equations developed here apply to other forms of rf current drive. Some of these may be very
efﬁcient, more so than lower-hybrid wave-induced ﬂuxes. For example, if low-phase-velocity waves

16

interact through a cyclotron resonance with fast electrons, the rf ﬂux may be nearly parallel to the constant
energy contours, at the same time that the collisionality of the resonant electrons is small. This gives very
high efﬁciency, but, in practice, these waves are much more difﬁcult to generate than are lower-hybrid
waves.

Settling the question of the highest attainable current-drive efﬁciency with fast waves should enable,
we hope, tokamak reactor designers to assess the practicality of using waves to drive steady-state currents.
There may, of course, be other effects that present difﬁculties, such as the accessibility of the waves or
nonlinear effects. On the other hand, there may be effects, such as the bootstrap current, which could be
helpful.

Finally, we hope that the form that we derived here for the relativistic collision operator, which
enabled us to solve for the relativistic Spitzer–H¨arm function, will be of use in other numerical problems
dealing with collisions in hot plasmas.

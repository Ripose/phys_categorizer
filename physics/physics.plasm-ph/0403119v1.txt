Abstract

A model for the condensation of a dusty plasma is constructed by considering the spherical

shielding layers surrounding a dust grain test particle. The collisionless region less than a collision

mean free path from the test particle is shown to separate into three concentric layers, each having

distinct physics. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is invoked at the interfaces between

these layers and provides equations which determine the radii of the interfaces. Despite being much

smaller than the Wigner-Seitz radius, the dust Debye length is found to be physically signiﬁcant

because it gives the scale length of a precipitous cut-oﬀ of the shielded electrostatic potential at

the interface between the second and third layers. Condensation is predicted to occur when the

ratio of this cut-oﬀ radius to the Wigner-Seitz radius exceeds unity and this prediction is shown

to be in good agreement with experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Condensation of a dusty plasma [1] into a crystalline state was proposed by Ikezi in 1986

[2] and demonstrated experimentally eight years later by a number of research groups [3–6].

The subject has been reviewed by Morﬁll et al. [7] and most recently an experiment to test

dusty plasma physics has been set up on the International Space Station [8].

The original model [2] for this process was motivated by Monte-Carlo calculations [9]

which predicted that a Coulomb crystal would form when the Coulomb interaction energy

between two adjacent charged particles in a one-component-plasma exceeded their thermal

energy by some factor. The Coulomb interaction energy for charged particles with density

n is the electrostatic energy of one particle in the potential of an adjacent particle located

at the Wigner-Seitz interparticle separation distance [10]

According to the Monte-Carlo calculations, condensation of charged particles into a crystal

should occur when

where Z is the charge on each particle and T is the temperature of the particles. As noted

by Ikezi [2], Eq.(2) could be a very poor estimate for dusty plasmas (which are a three-

component-plasma), but lacking a better model, Eq.(2) has often been used as a benchmark

for dusty plasma crystallization experiments. The experiments show [6] that the actual

value of Γ required for condensation is two to three orders of magnitude larger than that

predicted by Eq.(2). Thus, while Ikezi’s original postulate that dusty plasmas can condense

into crystals has been experimentally validated, there has not been a quantitative model

predicting the value of Γ necessary for condensation to occur.

Interactions between adjacent particles in a plasma are intimately related to the concept

of Debye shielding. According to this concept, any plasma particle can be considered to be a

test particle surrounded by a screening cloud of adjacent particles. The screening completely

cancels the test particle ﬁeld at distances much greater than the Debye length. Screening

may be accomplished by adjacent particles of either the same polarity as the test charge or

opposite polarity, but is subject to the constraint that the test particle cannot be moving

faster than the thermal velocity of the shielding particles [11]. For example, if the test

2

particle is an electron, it is shielded by the repulsion of other electrons in the presence of a

uniform neutralizing ion background, but it is not shielded by ions because it is moving too

fast for ions to respond. On the other hand, ions are shielded by both electrons and ions.

In a dusty plasma one might thus reasonably expect dust grains to be shielded by electrons,

ions, and other dust grains.

The standard model of Debye shielding is based on the Boltzmann relation, an equilibrium

solution to the ﬂuid equation of motion for each species σ such that the force due to the

electric ﬁeld balances the force due to the gradient of an isotropic scalar pressure, i.e.,

0 =

nσqσ∇

Pσ.

Three critical assumptions are intrinsic to the standard model of Debye shielding, namely:

(i) it is assumed that the plasma is suﬃciently collisional that the concept of an isotropic

scalar pressure Pσ = nσκTσ is valid, (ii) it is assumed that a Boltzmann dependence nσ =

nσ0 exp(

qσφ/κTσ) exists relating the local density nσ to the system-averaged density nσ0,

−

and (iii) it is assumed that

linearized giving nσ/nσ0 = 1

particle with charge qT results when the linearized Boltzmann relationships of the various

species are substituted into Poisson’s equation giving the Yukawa-type solution φ(r) =

standard model of Debye shielding has been noted previously, e.g., see Lampe, Joyce and

Ganguli [12] for criticism regarding assumptions (i)-(iii). In addition, Hansen and Fajans

[13] have shown that trapping can aﬀect Debye shielding in a pure electron plasma while

Goree [14], Zobnin et al. [15], and Lampe et al. [16] have shown that trapping of ions can

aﬀect shielding of a dust grain.

is essentially the same as Γ. Consensus

Furthermore, the form of Eq.(4) is such that the sum on the right hand side is dominated

by the term having the smallest λ2

Dσ and, since dust particles are both cold and highly
charged, the dust Debye length is typically much smaller than both the electron and ion

Debye lengths. One might expect that the system Debye length λD should be very nearly

the dust Debye length λDd, but this point of view has usually been rejected. The dust Debye

length λDd is typically so small that it is less than a, and questions have been raised as to

whether such a short shielding length has physical signiﬁcance since the standard Debye

argument is based on the implicit assumption that there is a statistically large number of

particles in a sphere having the Debye radius. This is clearly not true for dust particles

in a sphere with radius λDd if λDd is less than a. Nevertheless, Wang and Bhattarcharjee

[17] and also Otani and Bhattarcharjee [18] argued that some sort of shielding does occur

at the scale of λDd but the only support for this point of view was demonstration [18] of

some time-averaged correlation eﬀects at the scale of λDd in a one-dimensional numerical

simulation that would only crystallize if artiﬁcially annealed. Most other authors ignore

dust self-shielding on the presumption that the Debye shielding concept does not make

sense when a Debye length is smaller than a.

We present here a model for a dusty plasma on the verge of condensation. This model

takes into account both collisional and collisionless behavior in three dimensional geometry,

avoids inappropriate use of ﬂuid theory, shows that the dust Debye length has important

physical signiﬁcance even though it is much smaller than a, and predicts a condensation

threshold in good agreement with experimental measurements. The derivation identiﬁes four

physically distinct concentric regions surrounding a test charge. The ions are collisionless

in the innermost three regions but collisional in the outer, fourth region (the collisionless

nature of ions in the inner three regions is consistent with the assumptions inherent in dust

grain charging theory). The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to locate

the two interfaces between the ﬁrst three regions and knowledge of these interface locations

is then used to give the criterion for condensation. The Te >> Ti, Td temperature regime

of typical dusty plasma condensation experiments is assumed

and ions are assumed to

be singly charged (the theory could be extended to arbitrary temperatures without great

4

diﬃculty, but this would unnecessarily complicate the model).

The paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews relevant aspects of dust charging

theory and sets up a dimensionless parameter space suitable for comparing the model to

experiments. Section III uses collisionless Vlasov theory to calculate the ion, electron, and

dust grain densities and shows that when

> 1, the ion density diﬀers from the

eφ/κTi|
|

Boltzmann model; this diﬀerence demonstrates the inappropriateness of ﬂuid models in

this regime and resolves the paradox associated with divergence of the Yukawa solution

at small r. Section IV shows that the vicinity of a test particle can be divided into three

concentric spherical regions each having distinct physics determined by the magnitude of
eφ/κTi|
|
three regions and Section VI derives matching conditions across the two interfaces between

. Section V derives approximate solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system for these

the three regions. Section VII uses the matching conditions to deduce a condition for dust

condensation and compares the model predictions with experiments. Section VIII provides

a summary and discussion.

II. DUST CHARGING AND DUSTY PLASMA PARAMETER SPACE

Two independent parameters characterize the dust grains in a dusty plasma: the grain

radius rd and the Wigner-Seitz radius a. In order to develop a model based on dimensionless

parameters, the ion Debye length

λDi =

ε0κTi
ni0e2

will be used as the ‘yardstick’ by which all lengths are measured. A bar will be used to

denote lengths normalized to the ion Debye length so that the normalized Wigner-Seitz

radius, for example, is

¯a =

The two quantities ¯a and ¯rd constitute the coordinates for a dimensionless dusty plasma

and ψd will denote the potential on the surface of a dust grain. Thus, positive ψ attracts

ions but repels both electrons and dust grains.

When dust grains are placed in an electron-ion plasma, some fraction of the electrons

attach to the dust grain surface, causing the dust grains to become negatively charged and

reducing the density of free electrons. The quantitative theory of dust charging, summarized

in Ref. [1], combines collisionless Vlasov theory with an analysis of trajectories of individual

particles as they approach a ﬁnite radius charged sphere. The particle trajectories are

assumed to be governed by orbital-motion-limited (OML) theory [19–21] wherein particle

trajectories are assumed to be collisionless and completely determined by considerations

of conservation of angular momentum and conservation of energy. There has been some

question [6] about the extent to which the standard dust charging model applies to dust

grains in an electrode sheath, the typical situation for terrestrial dusty plasma condensation

experiments, but not for the zero-gravity dusty plasma condensation experiment on the

International Space Station. We assume in this paper that the standard dust charging

model is applicable so that the eﬀect, if any, of electrode sheaths on dust charging is small.

The standard dust charging model shows that dust grain charging is governed by the

dimensionless parameter

P = 4πnd0λ2

Global quasineutrality gives

where Zd is the number of electrons captured by a dust grain. We deﬁne the electron capture

factor

so that α = 1 corresponds to having all the electrons attached to the dust grains while

α = 0 corresponds to having no electrons attached to the dust grains. The quasineutrality

condition, Eq. (11), can thus be expressed as

and dust charging theory [22] shows that

Since ψd and α are functions of P, they have functional dependence α = α(¯a, ¯rd) and

ψd = ψd(¯a, ¯rd).

Combining Eqs. (9), (12) and (14) shows that

α = P ψd.

so that Zd becomes large if ψd is ﬁnite, ¯rd is not inﬁnitesimal, and 4πni0λ3

(15) is just the normalized version of the potential φd =

Zde. This result is actually slightly incorrect for a shielded dust

rd with surface charge

grain, because, as shown in the next paragraph, the shielding cloud surrounding a dust grain

Di is large. Equation
Zde/4πε0rd of a sphere of radius

depresses the potential at the grain surface to a value below the value given by Eq.(15).

To understand this potential depression eﬀect due to shielding, consider the potential φ

on the surface of a sphere with charge Q and radius rsphere surrounded by a shell of shielding

charge

III. VLASOV MODEL OF CHARGED PARTICLE DENSITY IN THE PRESENCE

OF A POTENTIAL

A typical dust grain will be considered as a test particle inserted in a plasma consisting

of electrons, ions, and other dust grains. The origin of a spherical coordinate system will be

deﬁned to be at the center of this test particle. Typical dust condensation experiments have

1 mm which is at least an order of magnitude larger than shielding

scale lengths. The last collision experienced by an ion in the vicinity of the test particle
will have occurred outside a sphere having a normalized diameter of the order of ¯lmf p; such

a sphere is shown schematically in Fig. 2 and lies at the interface between regions 3 and

4. Thus ions can be considered collisionless inside regions 1 to 3 and collisional in region 4;

the details of regions 1 to 3 will be discussed later. This separation of space into collisional

and collisionless regions is similar to the arguments used in dust grain charging theory (the

OML assumption underlying dust grain charging theory is based on angular momentum

conservation which can only be true if a particle has no collisions).

Electrostatic potential is undeﬁned with respect to a constant; following convention,

we choose this constant such that φ = 0 at inﬁnity. Collisions make the distribution

function Maxwellian in region 4 and this provides a boundary condition for the collisionless

distribution function in regions 1 to 3. The distribution function in regions 1 to 3 must

satisfy the collisionless Vlasov equation and so must be must be a function of constants

of the motion [23, 24]. The relevant constant of the motion here is the particle energy
W = mσv2/2 + qσφ, and so the distribution function in regions 1 to 3 is

(17)

This is the right choice because fσ(r, v) is not only a function of a constant of the motion

W but also joins smoothly to the region 4 Maxwellian solution where φ = 0 and the plasma

is collisional.

Electrons and dust grains experience a repulsive force upon approaching the negatively

charged dust grain test particle and so are slowed down with some particles being slowed

down to zero velocity and reﬂecting. Thus, electrons or dust grains near the dust grain

Ion behavior is fundamentally diﬀerent because ions, being positive, are accelerated as

they approach the negatively charged dust grain test particle; this means that there are no

zero velocity ions near a dust grain. The slowest ion is one that has fallen into the negative

φ well with zero initial velocity at the edge of the well and the velocity of such an ion will

satisfy

Using Eq.(8) it is seen that this minimum possible ion velocity can be expressed as

miv2/2 + eφ = 0.

vmin =

Evaluation of the ion density in the vicinity of the dust grain test particle therefore

(30)

this is much smaller than the ﬂuid theory Boltzmann relation prediction that ni/ni0 =

exp(ψ). Equation (30) thus demonstrates a failure of ﬂuid theory and its associated Boltz-

mann relationship when ψ >> 1. This failure occurs because the concept of ion pressure

no longer makes sense when ψ >> 1. The pressure concept is based on the assumption

that particles have an isotropic Gaussian distribution of random velocities about some mean

velocity whereas when ψ >> 1, ions in reality are falling into a deep potential well and

do not have a random distribution of velocities about some mean velocity. Equation (25)

and the distinction between its small and large ψ limits have been previously discussed by

Laframboise and Parker [25] in the context of electrostatic probes and by Lampe, Joyce and

Ganguli [12] in the context of dusty plasmas.

The lower limit of the integral in Eq.(24) causes the ion distribution to have an r

v

−

phase-space ‘hole’ in the vicinity of the dust grain since f (r, v) = 0 for velocities below

vmin. It has been argued by Bernstein and Rabinowitz [26], Laframboise and Parker [25],

and Lampe [27] that for a certain class of radial potential proﬁles, another sort of phase-

space hole can also exist. This additional hole results from a rather subtle barrier that

can occur because for a certain range of the angular momentum J the eﬀective potential
Uef f (r) = qφ(r) + J 2/2mr2 can have a small local maximum. This barrier prevents access

to small r by particles having a certain range of W and J. If such a barrier exists, the radial

ion density proﬁle will diﬀer somewhat from the predictions of OML theory, because the

ions that cannot pass by this barrier will have a radial turning point at a larger radius than

predicted by OML. However, since Poisson’s equation shows that ψ is essentially a double

integral of the net charge density up to a radius r, changes in the turning point of small

classes of ions should not have a major eﬀect on the ψ proﬁle, i.e., small corrections to the

OML model should not result in a signiﬁcant collective eﬀect. Lampe [27] has shown that

the error introduced by omission of consideration of these centrifugal force barriers is very

small for dusty plasmas and so we will ignore this correction to OML theory.

12

Another correction to OML theory results from consideration of ion capture by the dust

grain which also causes a hole in phase-space [20, 26]. As shown in Ref.[26] capture of ions

by the dust grain reduces the number of ions moving radially outward from the dust grain in

comparison to the limiting situation where the dust grain does not capture any ions so that

all ions are perfectly reﬂected from the dust grain. Taking into account the reduction in the

number of outward moving ions compared to inward moving ions would require replacing

the distribution function prescribed by Eq.(17) by a distribution function of the form [26]

f = f+ + f

where f+(W ) is the phase space density of ions moving radially outwards from

−

−

the dust grain and f

(W ) is the phase space density of ions moving radially inwards. If ions

are perfectly reﬂected at the dust grain then f+ = f

−
but if ions are captured by the dust grain then f+ < f

in which case Eq.(17) is appropriate,

and a more complicated prescription

−

than Eq.(17) would have to be used. We will assume that the fraction of ions incident at

¯ro which are captured by the dust grain is so small that Eq.(17) is a reasonably accurate

prescription for the ion phase space density. We are thus assuming that the r projection

of ion motion has a reﬂecting trajectory so that there are equal numbers of ions moving

radially inwards and outwards in the dust grain shielding cloud. This assumption will be

validated later.

Finally, we will also ignore ion trapping [14–16], but will later make some brief comments

about the extent to which trapping might be important.

is consistent with the collisionless Vlasov equation. Since the densities were obtained using

the collisionless Vlasov equation, this system will be called the Vlasov/Poisson system to

distinguish it from the ﬂuid/Poisson system.

We now argue that three distinct regions exist for ψ such that in each region the

Vlasov/Poisson system has a diﬀerent form. The location of these regions is sketched in

Fig.2 and, going outwards from the surface of the dust grain test particle, these regions and

their interfaces are deﬁned by:

Region 1 is where ψd > ψ > 1 and exists because the grain potential ψd is large compared

to unity [see Fig.1(a)]. Region 1 is a sheath-like inner region where the ion density has the

non-Boltzmann behavior given by Eq.(30).

Region 2 is where 1 > ψ > 1/Zd and is depleted of dust grains. Shielding in this region

is provided mainly by ions.

Region 3 is where 1/Zd > ψ and this region extends to region 4 where collisions set in

and where the potential goes to zero. Shielding in region 3 is done mainly by dust grains

and this shielding takes place over a very short characteristic length, causing an extremely

sharp cut-oﬀ of the potential.

The radii of the respective interfaces between regions 1 and 2 and between regions 2 and

3 will be called ¯ri and ¯ro as indicated in Fig.2 (the subscripts i and o stand for inner and

outer interfaces). The values of ¯ri and ¯ro will be unknowns to be solved for; determining

these radii is the crux of the problem.

V. APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS TO THE VLASOV/POISSON SYSTEM FOR

THE THREE COLLISIONLESS REGIONS

The three collisionless regions will now be discussed going from the outermost (region 3)

to the innermost (region 1).

The coeﬃcient in Eq.(35) has been chosen so that ψ3 = 1/ ¯Z at ¯r = ¯ro. The eﬀective

shielding length in region 3 is the dust Debye length

which is much smaller than the ion Debye length since α is of order unity [see Fig.1(b)] and
¯Z = ZdTi/Td >> 1.

B. Region 2 solution: 1 > ψ > 1/ ¯Z

The exp

term is dropped from Eq.(33) in region 2 because ¯Zψ is large. Taking

VI. MATCHING THE SOLUTIONS

A. Matching principle

this satisﬁes Gauss’s law at the dust grain surface and also gives ψ = 1 at ¯r = ¯ri. The

potential on the grain surface is

Matching consists of arranging for equality of ψ and ψ′ at the two interfaces between the

three collisionless regions; the necessity for continuity of ψ and ψ′ across an interface is

established by integrating Eq.(33) twice across the interface. Solutions on the left and right

hand sides of a matching radius ¯rm are of the general form ψlef t = L(¯r)/¯r and ψright = R(¯r)/¯r

and so matching requires

L(¯rm)/¯rm = ψm = R(¯rm)/¯rm

L′(¯rm) = R′(¯rm)

where ψm = 1/ ¯Z when ¯rm = ¯ro and ψm = 1 when ¯rm = ¯ri. Here L and R are the left

and right hand numerators: L is the numerator of ψ1 and R is the numerator of ψ2 when

¯rm = ¯ri; L is the numerator of ψ2 and R is the numerator of ψ3 when ¯rm = ¯ro.

B. Matching of ψ2 and ψ3 at ¯ro

The ψ2 and ψ3 solutions have already been arranged to satisfy Eq.(54) (i.e., ψ2 = ψ3 =

1/ ¯Z at ¯ro). The derivative matching condition, Eq.(55), is satisﬁed if

(60)

(61)

For given ¯a and α these nonlinear equations can be solved numerically for ¯ri and ¯ro. Since

α = α(¯a, ¯rd), this means that for any point in ¯a, ¯rd parameter space, one can calculate α

and then calculate ¯ri and ¯ro. Thus, we can consider ¯ri = ¯ri(¯a, ¯rd) and ¯ro = ¯ro(¯a, ¯rd).

Once ¯ri and ¯ro are known, the solutions ψ1, ψ2, and ψ3 are all determined and match

smoothly across the interfaces. The Vlasov/Poisson equation is thus solved all the way from

the grain surface to inﬁnity. The potential falls oﬀ abruptly at ¯r > ¯ro with a scale length

given by the dust Debye length. The dust Debye length is thus of physical importance

even though it is much smaller than the inter-particle spacing. No paradoxes occur due to

this situation because the solution for ψ is multi-scale and more complicated than a simple

Yukawa type potential. In particular, the dust shielding does not take place in a sphere

having a radius equal to the dust Debye length, but instead takes place over the surface of a

sphere having a much larger radius (a few times the ion Debye length). The extremely sharp

cut-oﬀ of ψ beyond ¯ro completely decouples dust grains from each other if their interparticle

separation distance exceeds ¯ro.

VII. CRYSTALLIZATION

When ¯a > ¯ro each dust grain is decoupled from neighboring dust grains and so the dust

grains behave as a gas of non-interacting particles. However, if ¯a < ¯ro, then each dust grain

is within the shielding cloud of its neighbor and subject to the unshielded repulsive force of
its neighbor. Because the repulsive force scales as ¯Zψ, this repulsion becomes enormous as

soon as a dust grain tries to move any signiﬁcant distance inside of the ¯r = ¯ro layer (i.e.,
inside of the ψ = 1/ ¯Z layer). When experienced by other dust grains, a test particle dust

grain thus acts like a hard sphere with radius ¯ro. Thus, dust grains cannot move signiﬁcantly

or are above it. The grain radius for the Hayashi/Tachibana experiment was multiplied by six (see

discussion in text).

inside ¯ro and so the condition for strong coupling and crystallization is that ¯a becomes less

than ¯ro. The condensation curve is found by making the following sequence of calculations

at each point ¯a, ¯rd in dusty plasma parameter space (i) calculate α(¯a, ¯rd), (ii) calculate ¯ri

and ¯ro by solving the nonlinear coupled Eqs.(60) and (61), (iii) plot the locus of the curve

¯ro = ¯a and establish which side of this curve corresponds to ¯a < ¯ro. The uppermost plot in

Fig. 3 shows contours of constant ¯ro/¯a calculated for Ref.[3] and marks the contour where

¯ro/¯a = 1 as the ‘condensation curve’; above the condensation curve (and with ¯rd << 1 as

discussed earlier) the dusty plasma should be crystallized. It is seen that portions of the

experiment line lie above the condensation curve which means that the model predicts that

20

the dusty plasma of Ref.

[3]

should be crystallized. Thus, there is excellent agreement

between the model and the experimental parameters of Ref. [3].

The other plots in Fig.3 are similar, but use data from the experimental results reported

by Thomas et al.

[4], Melzer et al.

[6], Hayashi and Tachibana [5], and Takahashi et al.

[28]. There is excellent agreement between the model and all these experiments with the

exception of the Hayashi/Tachibana experiment where agreement has only been achieved

by using a dust grain diameter six times larger than the reported 1.3 µm diameter. The

upper part of Table 1 lists the parameters of these experiments while the lower part gives the

results of dust charging theory and then the results of this model using a best-ﬁt density that

is within experimental error (as mentioned above, the value of ¯rd for the Hayashi/Tachibana

experiment has been increased by a factor of six to obtain a better ﬁt). The main result is the

values of ¯ri and ¯ro. The ¯ri values in Table I greatly exceed ¯rd showing that the depression of

the grain surface potential due to shielding is only a slight eﬀect. Table 1 shows that when

the published parameters of the experiments are used, a value of ¯ro is calculated which is

slightly larger than ¯a; the calculated ratio ¯ro/¯a is given in the bottom line of Table 1. The

fact that ¯ro/¯a is greater than unity indicates that the experiment is above the condensation

curve and so should be crystallized — this is our main result. For reference, Table 1 also

lists the value of Γ associated with these experiments, and it is interesting to note that

according to our model Γ has no physical signiﬁcance regarding condensation and so it is

not surprising that Γ has a range of quite diﬀerent values for the diﬀerent experiments.

It has not been possible to compare the model to the experiment underway [8] on board

the International Space Station, because plasma densities and temperatures have not yet

been provided for that experiment.

Figure 4 shows plots of

logψ, ψ, ψ on an expanded scale (to show the behavior when
1/ ¯Z), ne/ne0, ni/ni0, and nd/nd0 for the Chu and I experiment [3] using the values of

ψ

¯ri and ¯ro listed in Table 1. The ψ(¯r) plotted in Fig. 4 is calculated using Eq.(52) in region

1, Eq.(57) in region 2, and Eq.(35) in region 3; the electron, ion and dust densities in Fig. 4

are calculated using Eqs.(20), (25), and (21) respectively. The dust temperature Td has been
assumed to equal Ti so that ¯Z = Zd; diﬀerent values of Td would only change the decay rate

of ψ outside of ¯ro , but would not change the values of ¯ri and ¯ro since these are insensitive to
the value of ¯Z as long as it is large compared to unity. It is seen that there is a sharp cut-oﬀ

of the potential at ¯ro and that, beyond this radius, the potential decays precipitously with

21

a characteristic scale length given by the dust Debye length. The potential curve is smooth

all the way from the dust grain surface to inﬁnity; this smoothness results from choosing ¯ri

and ¯ro to match ψ and its derivatives at the interfaces between collisionless regions.

the sharp cut-oﬀ of the dust density at ¯r = ¯ro; the scale length of this cutoﬀ is the dust Debye

length λDd.

22

A question arises regarding why the grain diameter in the Hayashi/Tachibana experiment

[5] must be multiplied by six in order to achieve agreement with our model. The grain di-

ameter reported in the Hayashi/Tachibana experiment was much smaller than all the other

experiments (1.3 µm instead of 5-10 µm) and this diameter was measured using Mie scat-

tering, a very diﬀerent method from the visual means used in all the other experiments.

The discrepancy suggests that there might be a calibration error in the Mie scattering mea-

surement, a possibility that seems plausible because of the complicated multi-step analysis

required to implement the Mie scattering method. It is also possible that the assumptions

of Mie scattering theory do not apply to a charged dust grain since Mie scattering assumes

that the scatterer is a neutral dielectric whereas in actuality the scatterer is a dust grain
104 loosely bound electrons that might also scatter light. It

with a surface coating of

∼

should also be noted that the Takahashi et al. experiment [28] took place four years later

on the same apparatus as the Hayashi/Tachibana experiment [5] and had a reported grain

diameter at crystallization of 5.4 µm rather than 1.3 µm.

Another question to be addressed is the possible importance of (i) barriers due to lo-

cal maxima in the eﬀective potential [12, 26] and (ii) ion trapping/detrapping due to

collisions[14–16]. The model presented here argues that the amount of net charge in re-

gion 1 is so small that the potential in region 1 is nearly the same as the vacuum potential

that would be produced by a bare, unshielded dust grain [see Eq.(45)]. Changing the amount

of charge in region 1 by factors as large as order unity would not aﬀect this argument. Thus

any reduction in the amount of charge in region 1 because of eﬀective potential barriers will

make no diﬀerence to the region 1 solution, because it is already assumed that there is no

charge in region 1. So long as the number of trapped ions in region 1 is small compared to

Zd, the potential in region 1 is mainly due to the dust charge and again it is reasonable to use

the vacuum potential in region 1. As for region 2, the ion density predicted by collisionless

theory in region 2 is identical to the linearized Boltzmann relation obtained from collisional

theory [see Eq.(37)]. Since trapping and detrapping result from collisions, trapping and

detrapping should tend to make the system more Boltzmann-like, but since the system is

already Boltzmann-like in region 2, trapping and detrapping should not cause signiﬁcant

changes to the region 2 ion density proﬁle and thus should not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the ψ

proﬁle in region 2. Eﬀective potential barriers in region 2 may rearrange the radial charge

distribution in region 2 slightly, but this should cause only a small eﬀect on ψ because ψ

23

is a double integral with respect to radius of the net charge distribution [see Eq.(32)]. As

for region 3, the normalized potential ψ is so small in region 3 that ions are unaﬀected

by any spatial dependence of the potential; any corrections to the region 3 potential proﬁle

should therefore have negligible eﬀect on ion trajectories. Thus, while eﬀective potential

barriers and trapping/detrapping may modify the net charge radial proﬁle somewhat, these

should have a much reduced eﬀect on the ψ proﬁle and so should not cause any substantial

changes in the values of ¯ri or ¯ro. Small changes in the ψ proﬁle should not aﬀect the basic

premise that there exist three concentric collisionless regions each with distinct physics nor

the conclusion that dust grains condense when the radius ¯ro of the interface between regions

2 and 3 exceeds ¯a, the nominal intergrain spacing distance.

At this point in the discussion it is possible to revisit the assumption made at the end

of Section III that ion capture by dust grains may be ignored when characterizing the

collisionless ion velocity distribution function in regions 1-3. Ignoring ion capture by the

dust grain is tantamount to saying that all ions entering the collisionless region are reﬂected

radially so that there are equal numbers of ions moving radially inward and outwards; if some

ions were captured by the dust grain, there would be fewer ions moving radially outwards

than inwards. The number of captured ions can be estimated using OML theory [29] which

shows that the eﬀective cross-section for ions entering from a radius where the potential
is zero and then being captured by a dust grain is σcapture ∼

of this ratio using the Chu and I parameters in Table I (ψd = 46, ¯rd = 0.12, ¯r0 = 2.63) gives

VIII. SUMMARY

The standard linear ﬂuid analysis of Debye shielding fails when

qφ/κT

exceeds unity

because the linear Debye shielding model is based on the assumption that

is small

compared to unity. This issue is important for condensation of dusty plasmas, because

|

|
qφ/κT
|

|

condensation requires having

Zdeφ/κTd|
|

exceed unity.

Dusty plasmas can be characterized by an ¯a, ¯rd parameter space where ¯a and ¯rd are the

inter-grain spacing distance and grain radius normalized to the ion Debye length. An exper-

iment corresponds to a point in this parameter space and if the density of the experiment

is not known precisely, then the range of densities within experimental error corresponds to

a slanted line segment in this parameter space.

Because shielding distances are much smaller than an ion collision mean free path, ions

can be considered as collisionless in the shielding sphere surrounding a dust grain. A colli-

sionless Vlasov model is used to calculate particle densities in the electrostatic potential of

a dust grain test charge. This collisionless theory gives the same results as does Boltzmann

theory for electrons and for dust grains because they are negatively charged but gives results

diﬀerent from Boltzmann theory for ions in the vicinity of the dust grain. Ions near a highly

charged dust grain test particle fall into a deep potential well and are accelerated to high

velocities. This means that no ions have zero velocity near the dust grain test particle and

so integrals over the velocity distribution have a lower velocity limit corresponding to the

minimum velocity of an ion falling into the deep potential well. This invalidates the ﬂuid

theory concept of pressure because pressure is based on the assumption of the existence of

eφ/κTi|
random velocities about some mean. For
|
>> 1 the ion density is much less than that
eφ/κTi|

<< 1, the ion density corresponds to

the Boltzmann prediction, but for

|
predicted by the Boltzmann relation.

The potential in the vicinity of a dust grain test particle has three distinct types of

behavior. These behaviors occur in concentric spherical regions consisting of (1) an inner

region where the potential is vacuum-like, (2) a middle region where the potential includes

both growing and decaying Yukawa-like terms with characteristic scale lengths of the order of

the ion Debye length, and (3) an outer region with a rapidly decaying Yukawa-type solution

having a scale length of the order of the dust Debye length. Region 1 physics diﬀers from

ﬂuid theory, is consistent with dust charging physics, and avoids the paradoxes intrinsic to

25

ﬂuid theory at large

eφ/κT

|

.
|

For any point ¯a, ¯rd in dusty plasma parameter space, the requirement for smooth matching

of the solutions at the interfaces between the three inner regions determines the locations

¯ri and ¯ro of these interfaces. Condensation occurs when ¯a < ¯ro and occurs on the line

¯a = ¯ro (¯a, ¯rd) which gives a ‘condensation curve’ in dusty plasma parameter space; ¯a is less

than ¯ro above this curve and in this region the dusty plasma is crystallized. The model

predicts condensation parameters in good agreement with published experiments.

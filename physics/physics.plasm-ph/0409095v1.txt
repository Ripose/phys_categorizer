An analysis of the structural properties of three-dimensional Coulomb clusters conﬁned in a
spherical parabolic trap is presented. Based on extensive high accuracy computer simulations the
shell conﬁgurations and energies for particle numbers in the range 60 ≤ N ≤ 160 are reported.
Further, the intrashell symmetry and the lowest metastable conﬁgurations are analyzed for small
clusters and a novel type of excited state which does not involve a change of shell conﬁguration is
identiﬁed.

Spatially conﬁned mesoscopic charged particle systems have a number of unique properties not observed in con-
ventional quasineutral macroscopic plasmas of electrons and ions in discharges or solids, electrons and holes in highly
excited semiconductors and so on. With the help of conﬁnement potentials it has now become routine to trap, for
long periods of time, plasmas of a single charge (nonneutral plasmas), e.g. electrons and ions and even positrons in
Paul and Penning traps [1, 2], for an overview see [3], or colloidal (dusty) plasmas in discharge chambers, e.g. [4]. By
varying the conﬁnement strength researchers have achieved liquid behavior and even Coulomb crystallization of ions
[5] and dust particles [6, 7]. These strong correlation phenomena are of exceptional current interest in a large variety
of ﬁelds ranging from astrophysics (interior of Giant planets), high-power laser compressed laboratory plasmas, to
condensed matter and quantum dots [8] etc. Coulomb (Wigner) crystals are expected to exist in many White Dwarf
stars.

A particular property of trapped mesoscopic (N <

∼ 1, 000) clusters in spherical traps is the occurence of concentric
shells with characteristic occupation numbers, shell closures and unusual stable “magic” conﬁgurations. Due to their
close similarity to nuclei, metal clusters or atoms, these mesoscopic systems have been called “artiﬁcial atoms”. A
number of papers has been devoted to the exploration of the energetically lowest shell conﬁguration (ground state)
and metastable (“excited”) states of two-dimensional (2D) artiﬁcial atoms, e.g. [9, 10, 11] and references therein.

Recently, Arp et al. succeeded in the ﬁrst experimental creation of spherically symmetric 3D clusters, so-called
“dust Coulomb balls” [12] and presented an almost perfect crystal of N = 190 dust particles. This raises the question
about theoretical conﬁgurations of mesoscopic 3D Coulomb balls which is the subject of this paper. It is natural
to start with an analysis of the ground state and lowest metatstable states, referring ﬁnite temperature and melting
properties, e.g. [13], to a subsequent study.

The theoretical analysis of 3D artiﬁcial atoms is much more involved than in 2D and has so far mostly been
restricted to small cluster sizes with often conﬂicting results, e.g. [14, 15, 16] and references therein. Rafac et al. [15],
correcting earlier results, identiﬁed the ﬁrst shell closure at N = 12 (the 13th particle is the ﬁrst to occupy a second
shell) and presented detailed data, including ground state energies for N ≤ 27, but they missed the onset of the third
[14]. Tsuruta et al. extended the table to N = 59 [16]. The most extensive data, for up
shell, as did Hasse et al.
[14] and is a valuable reference for theoretical and
to a few thousand particles, has been presented by Hasse et al.
experimental groups. However, their tables report excited states rather than the ground states for N = 28 − 31, 44, 54
and practically for all N > 63 (except for N = 66). The reason for the computational diﬃculties is the existence of
a large number of excited (metastable) states which are energetically close to the ground state; with increasing N
this number grows exponentially whereas the energy diﬀerence rapidly vanishes. This has to be accounted for by the
computational strategy and choice of accuracy, see below.

Model: We consider N classicle particles with equal charge q and mass m interacting via the Coulomb force and

being conﬁned in a 3D isotropic harmonic trap with frequency ω with the hamiltonian

Despite its simplicity, model (1) captures the basic properties of a multitude of classical systems, in particular of dust
Coulomb balls and ions in spherical traps. Below we will use dimensionless lengths and energies by introducing the
units r0 = (q2/2πεmω2)1/3 and E0 = (mω2q4/32π2ε2)1/3, respectively.

To ﬁnd the ground and metastable states, we used classical molecular dynamics (MD) together with a suitable
“simulated annealing” method. Starting with a random initial conﬁguration of N particles, the system is cooled

continuously until all momenta are zero and the particles settle in minima of the potential energy surface. Depending
on the particle number, the cooling down process was repeated between a several hundred and a several thousand
times until every of the computed low energy states was found more than a given number of times (typically 10 . . . 100)
assuring a high probability (though no general proof) that also the ground state has been found. Crucial for a high
search eﬃciency is the use of an optimized MD time step (it has to be chosen not too small to avoid trapping in local
potential minima). The results are shown in tables I and II.

Consider ﬁrst the ground state shell conﬁgurations beyond the previously reported results [15, 16], see Tab. II.
Closure of the second shell is observed twice: for N = 57 [16] and N = 60. Further, we have found the closure of
the third shell to occur at N = 154, all larger clusters have at least four shells (in the ground state). The “nobel
gas like” closed shell clusters are particularly stable, but a few others also have a comparatively high binding energy
(addition energy change) ∆2(N ) = E(N + 1) + E(N − 1) − 2E(N ). Tsuruta et al.
[16] found the stable clusters
N = 4, 6, 10, 12, 19, 32, 38, 56. For larger clusters the binding energy decreases, and the relative diﬀerences rapidly
decrease. We found the next particularly stable ones to be N = 81, 94, 103, 116. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The
relative stability of these clusters is linked to a particularly symmetric particle arrangement within the shells which
will be analyzed below.

The existence of the shell structure is a marked diﬀerence from macroscopic Coulomb systems (N → ∞) and is,
of course, caused by the spherical conﬁnement potential. With increasing N the structure of a macroscopic system
emerges gradually, see also Ref. [13]. This can be seen from the relative widths ¯σm ≡ σm/rm of the m−th shell
(σm denotes the variance of the shell radius rm). For example, for N = 149, (starting from the outermost shell)
¯σ1 = 0.0089, ¯σ2 = 0.035 and ¯σ3 = 0.032, whereas for N = 160 we obtain ¯σ1 = 0.0091, ¯σ2 = 0.033 and ¯σ3 = 0.0038. In

both cases the outermost shell is signiﬁcantly narrower than the second one and this trend becomes more pronounced
as N increases. This is easy to understand because the eﬀect of the conﬁnement is strongest at the cluster boundary,
i.e. in the outer shell, whereas the inner shells are partially shielded from the trap potential by the surrounding particle
shells. In contrast, the behavior of the inner shells is not that systematic: in one case (N = 149) the third shell is of
similar (relative) width as the second, in the other case (N = 160) the inner shell is much narrower. The reason are
symmetry eﬀects which particularly strongly inﬂuence the width of the innermost shell (the cluster N = 160 has a
closed inner shell with 12 particles which is very narrow).

In Tab. I we also provide the ﬁrst excited states which correspond to metastable shell conﬁgurations which are
diﬀerent from the ground state. While the overall trend is a rapid decrease of the excitation energy (energy gap to the
ground state) with increasing N , some additional systematics is observed. Clusters which open a new shell typically
possess a close metastable state. For example, for N = 13 the relative stability of the conﬁgurations {N, 0} and
{N − 1, 1} changes, the latter becomes the ground state and the former the ﬁrst excited state, cf. Tab.I. A similar
trend is observed not only when a new shell is opened but also when an additional particle moves onto the inner shell

between the states {N1 − 1, N2} and {N1, N2 − 1}. Away from these transition points the energy diﬀerenc increases
and eventually another conﬁguration becomes the ﬁrst excited state.

An interesting observation is that frequently simulations yielding the same shell conﬁguration resulted in diﬀerent
total energies, see e.g. N = 16, 17, 22 in Tab. I. The diﬀerences are much larger than the simulation error, moreover,
the energies are reproducible. The obvious explanation is that the state of a cluster is not completely determined by
its shell conﬁguration (as it is the case in 2D). In addition, there exist further excited states, i.e. a “ﬁne structure”,
which are due to a diﬀerent particle arrangement and symmetry within one shell. To understand the diﬀerences in the
structure of these states with same shell conﬁguration we analyzed the intrashell symmetry by performing a Voronoi
analysis, i.e. by constructing polygons around a given particle formed by the lines equally bisecting nearest-neighbor
pairs on the shell, cf. the example of N = 17 shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, both states do not diﬀer with respect to the
number of polygons of each kind on the outer shell: there are N (5) = 12 pentagons and N (6) = 4 hexagons. However,
what is diﬀerent is the arrangement of the polygons: in one case, the four hexagons form a perfect tetrahedron ABCD
and are separated from each other by pentagons, cf. Fig. 2.a, in the other two pairs of hexagons touch, see Fig. 2.b,
and the tetrahedron is distorted, as shown in Fig. 2.c. Two edges remain practically constant (AB ≈ CD ≈ 1.63), but
the edge AB rotates with respect to the ﬁrst case by an angle of 34 degrees resulting in a reduction of edges BC and
AD to about 1.24 while AC and BD increase to 1.94. From this we conclude that of two states the one with the more
symmetric arrangement of the Voronoi polygons, i.e. (Fig. 2.a), has the lower energy. To quantify this topological
criterion, we introduce the Voronoi symmetry parameter

where NM denotes the number of all particles j in the shell, each of which is surrounded by a Voronoi polygon of order
M , (M nearest neighbors) and θjk is the angle between the jth particle and its kth nearest neighbor. A value G5 = 1
(G6 = 1) means that all pentagons (hexagons) are perfect, the magnitude of the reduction of GM below 1 measures
their distortion. Inspection of the values of GM for the two {16, 1} conﬁgurations for N = 17 (Tab. I) reveals that
the state with lower energy has higher values for both G5 and G6 than the second, conﬁrming our observation above.
This result is veriﬁed for all other N (of course it applies only to states with the same shell conﬁguration).

Having obtained with GM a suitable symmetry measure which is sensitive to the relative stability of ground and
metastable states, we now return to the issue of the overall cluster stability. To this end we compute the mean Voronoi
symmetry parameter (MVSP) by averaging over all GM of a given shell weighted with the respective particle numbers
N (M ). The results for the two outer shells for N ≤ 160 are included in Fig. 1. We clearly see that magic clusters
have not only a high binding energy but also a prominent symmetry [16], see in particular N = 12, N = 38, N = 103
and N = 116.

In summary, in this paper we have presented extensive simulation results for spherical Coulomb clusters with
N ≤ 160. The observed lowest energy states for N ≥ 60 are, in most cases, lower than those previously reported
and should be valuable reference for experiments with classical Coulomb balls in dusty plasmas or ultracold ions.
Moreover, the ground state results (shell conﬁgurations) are expected to be important also for quantum Coulomb

clusters (e.g. in quantum dots) in the strong coupling limit, as for 2D systems it was found that, in most cases, they
have the same shell conﬁguration as their classical counterpart [8, 11]. Further, we have presented an analysis of the
lowest excited states of small clusters. Besides metastable states with a shell structure diﬀerent from the ground state
we identiﬁed “ﬁne structure” states which are characterized by diﬀerent particle arrangement within the shells. These
states have a lower symmetry which is linked to higher values of the total energy. Despite the decreasing values of the
excitation energy with increasing N , knowledge of the lowest metastable states is important for understanding the
dynamic properties of mesoscopic clusters. We expect that the collective excitations of the clusters, i.e. the normal
modes which are excited in the system if kinetic energy is supplied will be strongly inﬂuenced by the metastable
states. Further, these states sthould be of importance for the melting behavior of mesoscopic Coulomb balls.

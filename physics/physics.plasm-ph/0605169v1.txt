Nonlinear interaction between three inertial Alfv´en waves.

Department of Physics, Ume˚a University, SE-901 87 Ume˚a, Sweden

The resonant coupling between Alfv´en waves is reconsidered. New results are found for cold

plasmas there temperature eﬀects are negligible.

The nonlinear interaction between Alfv´en waves (Sagdeev and Galeev, 1969; Hasegawa and Uberoi, 1982; Petviashvili
and Pokhotelov, 1992) is a key subject within modern plasma science (Shukla, 2004) that is still a matter of subtle
analysis (e.g. Fedun et al. 2004; Voitenko and Goossens, 2005; Shukla and Stenﬂo, 2005). In order to put the theory
on a ﬁrm theoretical basis, we shall in the present paper consider the resonant interaction between three inertial
Alfv´en waves in a uniform cold magnetized plasma, starting our analysis from the exact expressions for the coupling
coeﬃcients in such a plasma. Considering the appropriate frequency limits we shall then derive results which have not
been presented previously.

Let us thus investigate the resonant interaction between three waves with frequencies ωj (j = 1, 2, 3) and wave

vectors kj, and assume that the matching conditions

are satisﬁed. The development of, for example, the z-components (Ejz) of the wave electric ﬁeld amplitudes is then
governed by the three coupled bilinear equations (e.g. Stenﬂo, 1994)

z), the star denotes complex conjugate, αj are the coupling
where the z-axis is along the external magnetic ﬁeld (B0
coeﬃcients, d/dt = ∂/∂t+ vgj ·∇+ νj where vgj is the group velocity of wave j, and νj accounts for the linear damping
b
rate. As shown by Stenﬂo and Brodin (2005) the coeﬃcients αj for a cold plasma are

Equations (3)-(8) can be used to study the high-frequency coherent generation (Christiansen et al., 1981) or the
energy transfer from a large amplitude electromagnetic wave into an electrostatic electron wave and a lower hybrid
wave (e.g. Larsson et al., 1976; Stenﬂo, 1994; Kuo 2003; Stenﬂo, 2004). In the present paper we shall, however,
only adopt the above results to investigate wave couplings in the MHD regime.
In a previous work (Brodin and
Stenﬂo, 1988) we noted that in the ideal MHD regime, there is no coupling between three shear Alfv´en waves. We
will therefore show below that the more accurate two ﬂuid model gives predictions signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from ideal
MHD. To demonstrate this fact, we will consider low-frequency waves where the parameters have the standard MHD
ordering ω ∼ kzVA ≪ ωci and ωci ≪ ωpi, where VA is the Alfv´en velocity. However, in contrast to ideal MHD, we
shall here also allow for large perpendicular wave numbers, reaching up to k⊥ ∼ ωpe/c. Applying this scaling to Eq.
(7), we ﬁnd that the usual shear Alfv´en waves are modiﬁed to inertial Alfv´en waves, with frequencies

where λe = c/ωpe. Next we assume that all the three interacting modes are described by (9). In order to keep contact
with the ideal MHD regime where ω ≃ kzVA, we will allow for k2
e ∼ 1. Applying the above
assumptions to (6), we thus make the approximations

e ≪ 1 as well as for k2

For easy comparison with the MHD-results, it is convenient to eliminate Ez, and to work with the magnetic ﬁeld

Chosing wave 3 as a pump wave, the maximum growth rate γmax deduced from (18) is thus of the order

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

where the fastest growth occurs for decay products that are inertial Alfv´en waves with wavenumbers k1,2⊥ of the order
of λ−1
e . We note that for decay into standard ideal Alfv´en waves with k1,2⊥ ∼ k1,2z = ω1,2/VA, the growth rate thus
is reduced by a factor ∼ ω2
cimi. As a special limit of (20) we consider a pump wave which is a standard ideal
Alfv´en wave with k3⊥ ∼ k3z = ω3/VA. This gives

3me/ω2

As another example, we let the pump wave be an inertial Alfven pump wave with perpendicular wavenumber k3⊥ ∼

To summarize, we have considered the interaction of Alfv´en waves using results from the exact two-ﬂuid equations for
a cold magnetized plasma. We note that for an Alfv´en pump wave in the inertial regime (k3⊥ ∼ λ−1
e ), the maximum
growth rate for decay into inertial Alfv´en waves is larger than the usual MHD growth rates (including interaction
between all sorts of ideal MHD waves) by a factor of the order of (mi/me)1/2. Furthermore, for an ordinary Alfv´en
pump wave (k3⊥ ≪ λ−1
e ), we point out that the cold ideal MHD theory does not allow for resonant decay processes at
all (Brodin and Stenﬂo, 1988), since the Manley-Rowe relations prevent decay into modes of higher frequencies, and
the coupling coeﬃcients for interaction with two other Alfven waves are zero in the framework of ideal MHD. Thus

the growth rate found in (21) is the fastest decay possible in a cold plasma for an Alfv´en pump wave in the ideal
MHD regime (k3⊥ ≪ λ−1
e ). Furthermore, since the decay products have short scale lengths, we note that the ideal
MHD equations are unable to describe the nonlinear evolution, even if the initial conditions lie well inside the usual
validity conditions of those equations. We point out that resisitivity eventually leads to dissipation of the shorter scale
waves. Thus we conclude that the parametric processes considered in this paper can be important for understanding
the heating of low-beta plasmas. Finally we stress that high-beta plasmas require a separate analysis (Brodin and
Stenﬂo, 1990) and that extensions to three-wave interactions in a turbulent plasma (Vladimirov and Yu, 2004) are
comparatively straightforward.

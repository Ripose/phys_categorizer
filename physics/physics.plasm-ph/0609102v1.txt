The nonlinear evolution of resistive double tearing modes (DTMs) with safety factor values q = 1
and q = 3 is studied in a reduced cylindrical model of a tokamak plasma. We focus on cases where
the resonant surfaces are a small distance apart. Recent numerical studies have shown that in such
conﬁgurations high-m modes are strongly unstable. In this paper, it is ﬁrst demonstrated that linear
DTM theory predicts the dominance of high-m DTMs. A semi-empirical formula for estimating the
poloidal mode number of the fastest growing mode, mpeak, is obtained from the existing linear theory.
Second, using nonlinear simulations, it is shown that the presence of fast growing high-m modes
leads to a rapid turbulent collapse in an annular region, whereby small magnetic island structures
form. Furthermore, consideration is given to the evolution of low-m modes, in particular the global
m = 1 internal kink, which can undergo nonlinear driving through coupling to fast growing linear
high-m DTMs. Factors inﬂuencing the details of the dynamics are discussed. These results may
be relevant for the understanding of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) activity near the minimum
of q and may thus be of interest to studies concerned with stability and conﬁnement in advanced
tokamaks.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The advanced tokamak (AT) scenario, where the max-
imum current density is located oﬀ the magnetic axis, is
of considerable interest for achieving thermonuclear fu-
sion conditions and a quasi-steady-state operation in fu-
ture tokamak devices (e.g., Refs. [1, 2]). The associated
non-monotonic q proﬁles have pairs of resonant surfaces
with the same rational value qs = m/n and may give rise
to double tearing modes (DTMs) [3]. Several detailed
studies of DTMs were motivated by their possible role
in rapid current penetration, compound sawtooth oscil-
lations, oﬀ-axis sawtooth crashes and disruptions (e.g.,
Ref. [4] and references therein). It is important to un-
derstand the behavior of these instabilities in order to
ensure eﬃcient proﬁle control and safe operation of toka-
mak devices.

In this paper we consider cases with qs = 1 and qs > 1
DTMs, both of which have attracted much attention in
experiments. For instance, scenarios with two qs = 1 res-
onances and associated compound sawtooth oscillations
were observed in TEXTOR [5]. Oﬀ-axis sawteeth were
observed on TFTR when qmin is near or below 2 [6]. Re-
sistive and neoclassical qs = 2 DTMs were investigated
in ASDEX-Upgrade, one motivation being the possible
interaction of these modes with internal transport barri-
ers (ITBs) [7, 8]. qs = 3 DTMs are believed to play a
role in disruptions in JT-60 [9, 10].

In contrast to previous numerical works, which focused
mostly on cases where two resonant surfaces are located a
relatively large distance apart (e.g., Ref. [11]) and the lin-
early most unstable mode has the lowest possible poloidal
mode number [e.g., (m, n) = (3, 1) for qs = 3], our inter-
est lies in the regime where the distance between neigh-
boring resonant surfaces is still small. For this case, it
was found that DTMs (and multiple tearing modes in
general) with high poloidal and toroidal mode numbers m
and n are strongly unstable [12]. The linear instability of
DTMs for equilibria with small inter-resonance distances
was studied numerically in Ref. [4]. The purpose of the
present paper is (i) to shown that the ﬁndings of Ref. [4]
agree with linear DTM theory, and (ii) to present ﬁrst
nonlinear simulation results involving high-m DTMs for
cases with qs = 1 and qs > 1. For simplicity, a reduced
magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) model is employed.

Careful inspection of existing linear theory for DTMs
[13] shows that in the strongly coupled limit (small
mode numbers, small inter-resonance distance) the linear
growth rate is predicted to increase with the mode num-
m2/3. This scaling shown to agrees with nu-
ber as γlin ∝
merical results. A semi-empirical analytical formula for
estimating the mode number of the fastest growing mode
mpeak is presented, based on the transition criterion be-
tween the strongly and weakly coupled limits derived in
Ref. [13].

The magnetic island dynamics during the nonlinear
evolution of qs = 3 and qs = 1 DTMs is described. In
the qs = 1 case, the m = 1 internal kink mode is unsta-
ble and eventually dominates the dynamics. However,
full reconnection is not possible for small inter-resonance
distances, so the core merely undergoes oscillatory mo-
tion. Full reconnection is only possible when the inter-
resonance distance has already increased beyond the limit
where modes with m > 1 become sub-dominant or negli-

gible compared to the m = 1 mode. This is demonstrated
using an intermediate case where the m = 2 mode has a
slightly higher growth rate than the m = 1 mode.

Finally, the early evolution of the m = 1 mode is inves-
tigated in detail. Of particular interest is the nonlinear
driving due to fast growing high-m DTMs. It is shown
how the eﬃciency of this driving depends on the initial
conditions of the simulation and that the driving, despite
its radial localization, is capable of triggering the global
resistive m = 1 internal kink mode, similarly to the case
of qs = 1 triple tearing modes (TTMs) studied recently
[14].

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II the
physical model is introduced. In Section III we describe
the equilibrium conﬁgurations used and their linear dis-
persion relation. Section IV is dedicated to the linear
theory of resistive DTMs, and in Section V nonlinear
simulation results are presented. In Section VI we draw
conclusions, discuss possible applications and motivate
further research in this direction.

II. MODEL

We use the reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD)
equations in cylindrical geometry and in the limit of zero
beta [15, 16]. This model has proven to be useful in stud-
ies of MHD instabilities, when the focus is on a qualita-
tive description of fundamental aspects of the magnetized
plasma system, as is the case here. The RMHD model
governs the evolution of the magnetic ﬂux function ψ and
the electrostatic potential φ, as described previously in
Ref. [4]. The normalized RMHD equations are

∂tψ = [ψ, φ]

∂tu = [u, φ] + [j, ψ] + ∂ζj + Re−1

τHp = √µ0ρma/B0 and the radial coordinate is normal-

density and B0 the strong axial magnetic ﬁeld. The cur-
rent density j and the vorticity u are related to ψ and φ
through j =

Resistive diﬀusion is measured by the magnetic
Reynolds number SHp = τη/τHp in Eq. (1), with τη =
a2µ0/η0 being the resistive diﬀusion time and η0 = η(r =
0) the electrical resistivity at r = 0. We use SHp = 106,
which is numerically eﬃcient and physically reasonable
in the framework of the model used. Viscous dissi-
pation is measured by the kinematic Reynolds number
ReHp = a2/ντHp in Eq. (2), where ν is the kinematic ion
viscosity. We choose regimes where the Prandtl number

aﬀect the instability of the dominant modes.

scale of interest, i.e., here the inter-resonance distance
(normalized by a). E0 is taken to be constant, so the re-
sistivity proﬁle is given in terms of the equilibrium cur-
rent density distribution as ˆη(r) = j(r = 0)/j(r). For
simplicity, the temporal variation of the resistivity pro-
ﬁle ˆη is neglected.

As in Ref. [4], each ﬁeld variable f is decomposed into

an equilibrium part f and a perturbation

f as

f (r, ϑ, ζ, t) = f (r) +

f (r, ϑ, ζ, t).

with m being the poloidal mode number and n the
toroidal mode number. In the following, the (m, n) sub-
scripts will often be omitted for convenience. We consider
only the nonlinear couplings between modes of a single
helicity h = m/n, so the problem is reduced to two di-
mensions. Results for the linearized system are obtained
using initial-value and eigenvalue solvers as described in
Ref. [4]. The nonlinear RMHD equations are solved nu-
merically using the simulation code described in Ref. [14].

III. EQUILIBRIUM AND LINEAR
INSTABILITY

The equilibrium state is taken to be axisymmetric
(only m = n = 0 components) and free of ﬂows, i.e.,
φ = u = 0. The equilibrium magnetic conﬁguration is
uniquely deﬁned in terms of the safety factor q(r), and
the magnetic ﬂux function and current density proﬁles
are obtained though the relations

modes having m greater than the lowest poloidal mode
number that is consistent with a given ﬁeld line pitch
qs = m/n. The dispersion relations (spectra of linear
growth rates) γlin(m) are plotted in Fig. 2. In Cases (D-
1) and (D-2), pairs of resonant surfaces with qs = 3 and
1, respectively, are located a small distance D12 = 0.06
apart, so that the fastest growing mode has mpeak = 8.
In addition, we consider Case (D-3) with qRes = 1, which
has a larger inter-resonance distance, D12 = 0.21. Here,
the dominant mode is mpeak = 2. The characteristics
of all cases are summarized in Table II. Linear eigen-
mode structures of DTMs with various mode numbers m
were presented in Ref. [4]. Note that there can be up to
two unstable eigenmodes for a given (m, n). Eigenmodes
peaking in the region 0 < r < rs1 (for qs = 1) or near rs1
(for qs > 1) are denoted by M (1), while those extending
to the outer resonant surface are labeled M (2). When
D12 is small, the M (2)-type eigenmodes are usually dom-
inant for m > 2 and only their growth rates are plotted
in Fig. 2.

Finally, a comment is in place with regard to the re-
gion that can undergo magnetic reconnection in the cases
studied here. The proﬁles of the equilibrium helical ﬂux
functions ψ∗ = ψ + r2/(2qs) in Fig. 3 show that the re-
connectable regions do not include the magnetic axis at
r = 0. Since all cases satisfy ψ∗(r = 0) < ψ∗(rs2), the
reconnection can only be partial [17, 18].

growth rates of both m = 1 eigenmodes, M (1) (single kink)
and M (2) (double kink), are shown: γ(1)(m = 1) = 4.0 × 10−3
and γ(2)(m = 1) = 2.5 × 10−3. All other growth rates belong
to M (2)-type eigenmodes, as deﬁned in the text.

[ReHp = 107 in Case (D-3)].

IV. LINEAR THEORY FOR RESISTIVE DTMS

Pritchett, Lee and Drake (PLD) [13] developed a lin-
ear theory for resistive DTMs by applying the techniques
and results from the theory for the resistive m = 1 inter-
nal kink mode by Coppi et al. [19]. When discussing the
resulting dispersion relation, PLD focused on the resis-
S−1/3
tivity dependence of the linear growth rate: γlin ∝
Hp
S−3/5
in the
in the strongly coupled limit, and γlin ∝

weakly coupled limit. Here, strongly coupled means that
the product of the poloidal wave number kϑ = m/r0 [r0 =
(rs1 +rs2)/2] and xs = D12/2 satisﬁes kϑxs < (kϑxs)trans,
whereas in the case of weak coupling kϑxs > (kϑxs)trans.

nor strongly stable (tearing limit) in ideal MHD [13]. In

Note that the parabolic approximation aﬀects only the

that in the weakly coupled limit the growth rate of DTMs
decreases with increasing m (as it does for ordinary single
tearing modes).

The growth rate spectra in Fig. 2 show an increase of
γlin with m for m < mpeak and a decrease for m > mpeak.
The former corresponds to the behavior expected for the
strongly coupled limit, kϑxs < (kϑxs)trans, and the latter
is similar to the weakly coupled limit, kϑxs > (kϑxs)trans.
Hence, it is reasonable to look for an estimate for mpeak in

Equation (13) is useful for small D12 = 2xs, where
mpeak > 1. Note that a small inter-resonance distance
also implies that the diﬀerence between the shears s1 and
s2 is small. Hence, due to the weak shear dependence it
is not so important whether mpeak is evaluated using s1
or s2.

The poloidal mode number of the fastest growing lin-
ear mode, mpeak, is useful for the interpretation of the
nonlinear dynamics, since it determines the size of the
magnetic island structures. Numerically computed val-
ues for the proﬁles used in this study are given in Table II.
Before proceeding, it is necessary to discuss the shape
of the growth rate spectrum in the weakly coupled regime
(m > mpeak). While the numerically calculated spec-
tra in Figs. 2 and 4 are convex (d2γlin/dm2 < 0) for
m−6/5 derived above
m > mpeak, the power law γlin ∝
suggests a concave shape. Numerical results obtained for
109 indicate that a concave shape
higher values of SHp ∼
for m > mpeak appears as SHp is increased (cf. Fig. 10
in Ref. [4]). Thus, the origin of the discrepancy between
the m−6/5 power law and Figs. 2 and 4 lies in the rela-
tively small value of SHp = 106 used here. The growth
rates and mpeak increase with decreasing SHp, while the
number of unstable modes tends to be rather insensi-
tive to SHp (cf. Fig. 10 in Ref. [4]). This may explain
the convex shape observed here. Note that SHp aﬀects
high-m modes more strongly than low-m modes, so that
the m2/3 power law is still a good representation for the
low-m part of the spectrum.

We begin with a description of the magnetic reconnec-
tion dynamics in Sec. V A where the system as a whole is
considered. In Sec. V B the evolution of individual modes
is analyzed in detail.

A. Magnetic reconnection dynamics

First, consider Case (D-1) where two qs = 3 resonances
are located a small distance D12 = 0.06 apart. A non-

linear simulation was carried out using Ψ0,m>0 = 10−7,
SHp = 106 and ReHp = 108, and including 32 modes
(m = 0, 3, ..., 93). Snapshots showing contour plots of

in Fig. 5. We observe that, in response to the random
broad-band perturbation applied, magnetic reconnection
occurs simultaneously at many locations, giving rise to a
multitude of small magnetic islands. In Figs. 5(A) and
(B) it can be seen that the dominant island sizes cor-
respond to the mode numbers m = 6 and 9 (dispersion

relation: mpeak = 9). The onset of the reconnection is
determined by the growth rate of the (9, 3) mode, which
is about 1.6 times that of the (3, 1) mode (cf. Fig. 2).
The reconnection leaves behind an annularly ﬂattened q
proﬁle, as can be seen in Fig. 5(C).

∼

Next, let us investigate the response of qs = 1 DTMs
in Case (D-2). The calculation was performed with
Ψ0,m>0 = 10−7, SHp = 106 and ReHp = 108, and 128
modes (m = 0, 1, ..., 127) were included. As can be seen
in Fig. 6(A), the reconnection dynamics begin with an
annular collapse with more or less turbulent patterns
dominated by mode numbers around m
7–9, in ac-
cordance with the peak of the linear dispersion relation
(mpeak = 8). Note in Fig. 6(A) that the q proﬁle has
been ﬂattened in the inter-resonance region and that the
resistive m = 1 internal kink mode is not yet involved in
the dynamics. The kink appears at a later time, leading
to a growing core displacement inside the turbulent re-
gion, as can be seen in Fig. 6(B). After all reconnectable
ﬂux surfaces have been reconnected a rebound occurs and
the core displacement decays as indicated by the arrows
in Fig. 6(C). The further evolution was not investigated,
but continuing oscillation of the core is to be expected.
in Fig. 7 simulation results are presented
for Case (D-3). The calculation was performed with
Ψ0,m>0 = 10−7, SHp = 106 and ReHp = 107, including
128 modes (m = 0, 1, ..., 127). Case (D-3) is a realization
of the intermediate regime where two qs = 1 resonances
are located so far apart that the fastest growing mode is
m = 2, closely followed by m = 1. It can be seen that
magnetic islands with dominant mode numbers m = 2
and m = 1 largely determine the structure of the mag-
netic surfaces [Fig. 7(A) and (B)]. In the present case, the
m = 1 mode tends to dominate on the outer resonance
and m = 2 on the inner one, which leads to a strong
deformation of the inter-resonance region into a D-shape
[Fig. 7(C)]. This calculation had to be terminated soon
after snapshot (C) due to a continuing increase in the
energies of high-m modes. An island separatrix is ap-
proaching the coordinate origin, r = 0, and our numer-
ical code is not suitable for further following dynamics
with such a kind of asymmetry.

Finally,

Equilibria with larger inter-resonance distance D12
than in Case (D-3) have a dominant m = 1 mode and
the dynamics proceed as described in earlier studies (e.g.,
Refs. [9, 17]).

B. Detailed evolution of individual modes

For the discussion of the evolution of individual Fourier
modes we focus on Case (D-2), where two qs = 1 reso-
nant surfaces are located a small distance apart. The
results are similar in other cases with diﬀerent qs, pro-
vided that mpeak is several times larger than the lowest
possible mode number m. The evolution of the individ-
ual Fourier modes is described in terms of their kinetic

In Fig. 8 the evolution of (a) the energies and (b)
growth rates of the m = 1 and m = 0 modes in Case
(D-2) is shown. During phase (i) the linear mode struc-
ture of the m = 1 mode is gradually established. In the
present case, this process is not fully completed by the
time the nonlinear drive (ii) sets in, as can be inferred
1,1 and γmag
from the fact that γkin
1,1 are not equal and still
vary in time.

The nonlinear driving phase (ii) begins when the
fastest growing modes (not shown) reach suﬃciently large
amplitudes so that they start to drive slower modes

m = 1 and m = 0 modes in Case (D-2). As in Fig. 8(b), but
with diﬀerent initial conditions: (a) The perturbation ampli-
tude is Ψ0 = 10−12 for all modes, and the initial phases for
the ﬁve dominant modes m = 6–10 are ϑ0m = {0, 0, π, π, 0}.
(b) The perturbation amplitude is Ψ0 = 10−12 for all modes,
and the initial phases for the dominant modes m = 6–10 are
ϑ0m = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}. These results were obtained with a re-
duced number of modes, m = 0–31, and are not valid far
beyond t ∼ 1700 τHp. SHp = 106, ReHp = 108.

In Fig. 8 the m = 1 mode switches between (al-
most) linear and nonlinearly driven exponential growth
around t
300. Here, the driving is primarily due to
the coupling between the modes m = 8 and m = 7.
Consequently, according to Eq. (17), the expected en-
hanced growth rate is γdrive(m = 1)
γdrive(m = 0) =
≈
10−3. The level of nonlinear driv-
2γlin(m = 8) = 17.5
ing can conveniently be inferred from the growth rate of
the m = 0 mode (only magnetic energy). The m = 0
mode is not an unstable eigenmode and its evolution is
entirely a result of nonlinear driving by higher-m modes.
The annular collapse, labeled by (iii) in Fig. 8, begins
already during the driving phase and continues beyond
it. The dynamics during this stage were described above
in Section V A.

FIG. 10: (Color online). Eﬀect of the nonlinear driving on
the m = 1 mode structure in Case (P-2) [cf. Fig. 9(b)]. The
two fastest growing modes are m = 8 and m = 7 [cf. Fig. 2].
In (a) the linear eigenmode structure ψ(1)
1,1 is shown. In (b)
and (c) the typical structure of the driving terms can be seen.
Here, the terms (∂rψ8,8)(7/r)φ7,7 and (8/r)ψ8,8(∂rφ7,7) are
shown, representatively for the convective nonlinearity [ψ, φ]
in Eq. (1). In (d) the mode structure during the nonlinear
driving phase is plotted.

reason for this lies in the initial perturbation. We have
determined two factors that need to be considered: (A)
the perturbation amplitude, and (B) the phase relations
between the driving modes.

The eﬀect of (A) can be seen by comparing Fig. 8(b)
with Fig. 9(a). Figure 9 shows results for Case (D-2)
that were obtained with a lower perturbation amplitude
Ψ0 = 10−12 [in Fig. 8: Ψ0 = 10−7]. Now, there is more
time for all modes to establish the linear mode structures.
Clearly, the nonlinear driving in Fig. 9(a) reaches a higher
level than in Fig. 8(b).

Factor (B) implies that the growth rate γdrive may also
stay below 2γpeak when there are several higher-m modes
with growth rates approximately equal to γpeak and when
the phase relations between these modes are “unfavor-
able.” Thus, γdrive can be increased by “aligning” the
phases of the fastest growing modes in the spectrum. The
result of aligning the ﬁve modes m = 6–10 is shown in
Fig. 9(b). Clearly, the driving of the m = 1 mode is now
much more eﬀective.

Strictly speaking, the eﬀect of aligning the relative
phases is merely to reduce the time needed to establish
the nonlinear driving.
Its eﬀect on the growth rate is
only temporary. Note that the growth of the m = 0
mode is not aﬀected by phase relations between the driv-
ing modes, as is to be expected.

The eﬀect of the nonlinear driving on the m = 1 mode
structures can be observed in Fig. 10. Note in partic-
ular that despite the radial localization of the driving
terms [Fig. 10(b) and (c)], the m = 1 mode [Fig. 10(a)]
as a whole grows at an enhanced rate. Once the driving
is established the mode structure varies only minutely

[Fig. 10(d)]. Thus, a new nonlinear mode structure is
formed. One consequence of this global eﬀect of the lo-
calized driving is that in cases where the driving term
happens to have the opposite sign, it induces a switching
of the sign of the global m = 1 mode structure at the
onset of the nonlinear driving phase. Such an event can
be observed in Fig. 9(b), where Emag
2,1 performs an under-
and overshoot as a result of sign reversal.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented new results on linear
instability and nonlinear dynamics of resistive DTMs for
small inter-resonance distance D12. These may be sum-
marized as follows:

1. The linear growth rates γlin(m) of low-m modes
m2/3 pre-
increase with m. The power law γlin ∝
dicted by the linear theory developed in Ref. [13]
agrees with numerical results. For high-m modes
γlin(m) decreases with m. A semi-empirical for-
mula for the mode number of the fastest growing
mode mpeak was proposed [Eq. (13)] using results
of Ref. [13].

2. The dominance of several high-m DTMs in conﬁgu-
rations with small D12 leads to an annular collapse
with small island structures.

3. Before entering the fully nonlinear regime, the
fastest growing modes drive slower modes. For
qs = 1, this includes the global m = 1 resistive in-
ternal kink mode, despite the fact that the driving
is radially localized between the resonant surfaces.

The estimate for mpeak (point 1.) is valid only for re-
sistive DTMs [24]. Also, Eq. (13) does not apply to cases
with more than two resonant surfaces. For instance, for
triple tearing modes (TTMs) both mpeak and the num-
ber of unstable modes are larger than for DTMs under
comparable conditions, indicating that a TTM tends to
be an even stronger instability [20].

The turbulent annular collapse (point 2.) shows that
the nonlinear DTM dynamics in cases with small inter-
resonance distances (dominant high-m modes) are dif-
ferent from those studied previously by other authors
using large inter-resonance distances (dominant lowest-
m mode). Our results may be of interest for scenarios,
where qmin is gradually lowered by increasing the oﬀ-
axis current. Experimentally, an apparently quiescent
passage through low-order resonant surfaces and thus
access to regimes with larger inter-resonance distance,
was found to be possible by applying additional external
drive (e.g., Ref. [8]). MHD activity was reported after the
inter-resonance distance had grown substantially and the
dynamics seem to be dominated by low-m modes. It is
possible that earlier high-m activity predicted by our sim-
ulations is either prevented by the external drive (not in-
cluded in our model) or has escaped detection. Through

9

recent progress in plasma diagnostics, which allows to de-
tect high-m magnetic islands on low-order resonant sur-
faces [21], experimental checks of our simulation results
may be feasible in the near future.

The nonlinear driving (point 3.) experienced by slower
modes is of particular interest for the m = 1 inter-
nal kink mode. The nonlinear driving implies that the
m = 1 mode appears signiﬁcantly earlier than would be
expected from its linear growth rate. Hence, the fast
growing high-m DTMs eﬀectively provide a trigger mech-
anism for the m = 1 mode, similarly to the TTM case
described in detail in Ref. [14]. Note that, by the time the
m = 1 mode becomes observable, the inter-resonance re-
gion has already undergone reconnection (point 2.). The
lack of magnetic shear allows the m = 1 mode to grow
as an ideal internal kink instability. In contrast to the
TTM case, there is no sawtooth crash associated with
the activity of the m = 1 mode when the inter-resonance
distance is small. However, the rapid excitation of m = 1
oscillations observed in our simulations may be useful in
experiments to determine the instant in time when qmin
passes through the qs = 1 resonant surface.

It is important to note that the instability of a broad
implies that the details
spectrum of modes (point 1.)
of the nonlinear dynamics (points 2. and 3.) depend
on the initial conditions used in the simulation. For
instance, the eﬃciency of the nonlinear driving (point
3.) was shown to depend on the phase relations between
the fastest growing modes (cf. Fig. 9). Furthermore, the
phase relations determine where the ﬁrst magnetic is-
lands form.
In principle, it is possible to produce the
ﬁrst magnetic islands in a poloidally localized region. Al-
though, this discussion of initial perturbations may seem
rather academic, we believe that it may bear practical
importance. For instance, pellet or neutral beam injec-
tion may provide a localized magnetic perturbation and
possibly form robust helical structures such as “snakes”
[22]. Furthermore, if the DTMs are excited by micro-
turbulence, modes with m > mpeak may dominate the
annular collapse, in contrast to the present study, where
all modes were perturbed with similar amplitude so that
mpeak became dominant.

In conclusion, the results presented in this paper may
be relevant for the understanding of the MHD activity
near qmin and may thus be of interest to studies concerned
with stability and conﬁnement in advanced tokamaks.
The results motivate further research in this direction
using more realistic models.

[23] As mentioned earlier, during the transition from strongly
to weakly coupled DTMs the exponent for xs depends
increasingly on the shape of the q proﬁle in the inter-
resonance region. The approximation referred to here lies
in the assumption that γh ≈ B′
s . Indeed, there is not
much freedom for varying the shape of the q proﬁle in
the inter-resonance region when the distance between the
resonances must be small, so for realistic q proﬁles the
parabolic approximation may be expected to be rather
accurate.

[24] Nevertheless, the broad spectrum and high mpeak are also
found when reconnection is mediated by other mecha-
nisms, such as electron inertia as will be shown in a sep-
arate paper.

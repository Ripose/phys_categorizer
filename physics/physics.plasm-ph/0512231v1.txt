The kinetic theory of collisionless electrostatic shocks resulting from the collision of plasma slabs
with diﬀerent temperatures and densities is presented. The theoretical results are conﬁrmed by self-
consistent particle-in-cell simulations, revealing the formation and stable propagation of electrostatic
shocks with very high Mach numbers (M ≫ 10), well above the predictions of the classical theories
for electrostatic shocks.

The collision of clouds of plasma with diﬀerent prop-
erties (temperature, density, composition etc.) is a sce-
nario quite common in nature. For instance, during su-
pernovae explosions, large quantities (10 solar masses) of
8 K) are ejected into
high temperature plasma ( T
4 K) [1, 2],
the interstellar medium (n

and plasma cloud collisions are at the core of the ﬁreball
model for gamma ray bursters [3]. Plasma cloud colli-
sions also occur when the solar wind interacts with the
Earth Magnetosphere, or when it encounters the inter-
stellar medium in the heliosphere region [4]. In the lab-
oratory, such scenarios appear during the laser induced
compression of plasma foils in solid targets [5].

The collision of plasma shells leads to the onset of
plasma instabilities and to the development of nonlinear
structures, such as solitons, shocks and double layers [6].
In the absence of an ambient magnetic ﬁeld, the shock
waves are electrostatic [7, 8], and the dissipation is pro-
vided by the population of electrons trapped beyond the
shock front [6, 9] and, for stronger shocks, by the ion re-
ﬂection from the shock front [10]. Whilst the properties
of shocks induced by collision of identical plasma shells,
or by compression of plasma clouds, have been exten-
sively studied in the past [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
the properties of the electrostatic shock waves formed
during the collision of diverse plasma slabs of arbitrary
temperature and density are rather unexplored [15]. The
theory for electrostatic shocks induced by impact of iden-
tical plasma shells predicts an absolute maximum Mach
3 (or, when ion reﬂection and thermal
number Mmax ≃
6). However, collisionless
eﬀects are included, M ∗max ≃
shock waves with Mach numbers ranging between 10 and
103 have been observed in many astrophysical scenarios
[1], and very large Mach number cosmic shock waves are
thought to play a crucial role in the evolution of the large
scale structure of the Universe [16, 17].

In this Letter, we present a kinetic theory describing
the properties of the very high Mach number (M
10)
laminar shock waves arising from the collision of slabs

∼

of plasma with diﬀerent properties (temperatures, den-
sities), and in the absence of an ambient magnetic ﬁeld.
We demonstrate that the shock properties are strongly
inﬂuenced by Θ, the ratio of the electron temperatures
in the two slabs, and by Υ, the ratio of the electron den-
sities in the two slabs. The analysis shows that when the
electron temperature Te R of the downstream slab (R) is
higher than the electron temperature Te L of the upstream
slab (L), the shock waves can have very large Mach num-
bers, which are otherwise not supported by isothermal
plasmas [6, 7, 8]. The model predicts that the maxi-
mum allowed Mach number increases with Θ, without
an absolute upper limit. The theoretical results are con-
ﬁrmed by one-dimensional (1D) self-consistent particle-
in-cell simulations, demonstrating the formation and the
stable propagation of electrostatic shock waves with very
large Mach numbers (M

20).
The shock transition region is modeled as a planar one
dimensional double layer, which is stationary in the ref-
erence frame of the shock; the electrostatic potential in-
creases monotonically from φ = 0 at x = xL to φ = φ0
at x = xR, as shown in Figure 1. The one dimensional
treatment should hold for propagation distances smaller
than the transverse dimension of the shock. The struc-
ture of the double layer is maintained by two popula-
tions of free electrons (from the L and R slabs), a pop-
ulation of trapped electrons (from the R slab), and a
population of cold ions. The model considers the con-
tribution of the trapped particles self-consistently, by
treating the electrons in a kinetic fashion [6, 7]. To
maintain a steady state, the number of electrons in unit
time dt, with velocity between [ve, ve + dve] and po-
sition between [x, x + dx], must balance the electrons
injected from the left slab (L), at x = xL, with ve-
locity between [vL, vL + dvL], and the electrons from
the right slab (R), at x = xR, with velocity between
[vR, vR + dvR]. We can express the electron distribution
function fe(x, ve), at any given point x, as a function of
the electrons injected at the left and right boundaries,

which follow known distribution functions. The electron
velocity, which results from conservation of energy, can

be written as ve =

pending if the particles are arriving from the left bound-
ary or from the right boundary; here me is the electron
mass, and e is the elementary charge. Assuming that
only electrons with positive velocity enter from the slab
L, and only electrons with negative velocity enter from
the slab R, we obtain:

tion is composed of a free and a trapped part, fR(vR) =
fRf (vR) + fRt(vR). If their kinetic energy is larger than

This idea of describing an electron gas, composed of free

tion with a ﬂat-top, has been widely used in the past
to model stationary ion acoustic structures [6, 7, 8, 12],
and it is called ‘maximum-density-trapping’ approxima-
tion [6, 9].

The density of electrons along the shock can be cal-
culated by integrating the electron distribution function
fe(x, ve) in velocity space. Following Equation (1), we
can separate the electron density along the shock in the
contributions from the L and R slabs. The density of
the electrons coming from the slab L can be written as
nL(ϕ) = N0L
kB TeL . In our model,
the electrons coming from the region L are continuously
accelerated while moving towards the right boundary,
and are not reﬂected or trapped by the electrostatic po-
tential. The density of electrons from the slab R is ob-
tained using Equation (1), integrating the term contain-

ion acoustic Mach number, Vs =
kBTeL/mi is the ion
sound speed, mi is the ion mass, and N0 is the unper-
turbed ion density in the slab L. The reﬂection of ions
is not included in the present model. Such assumption
is consistent with a double layer solution maintained by
a population of trapped electrons [6, 9]. The aim of the
present Letter is to show that the collision of plasma
slabs, with appropriate temperature and density ratios,
leads to shock waves with very large Mach numbers.
Since the occurrence of ion reﬂection increases even fur-
ther the velocity of the shocks, the conclusions of the
present Letter are to be considered as conservatives.

In the derivation of the ion and electron densities, we
used the quantities N0R, N0L and N0, which can now
be evaluated by applying boundary conditions proper of
double layers [6, 9]. Using charge neutrality at x = xL
and at x = xR, we obtain the conditions N0 = N0L +N0R
and nR(ϕ0) + nL(ϕ0) = ni(ϕ0), thus leading to N0L and
N0R as function of the unperturbed ion density N0, of
the normalized potential ϕ0, and of the Mach number
M . Since it is clear that the electron distribution func-
tions are always positive, we must apply the physical
inequalities N0L, N0R > 0.

By combining the ion and electron densities with Pois-
son’s equation, and since the dynamics of the electro-
static potential is analogous to the motion of a particle
in a potential well Ψ, we ﬁnd that the evolution of the
electrostatic potential is governed by 1

the system supports soliton-like structures. On the other
hand, the conditions of charge neutrality at the bound-
|0,ϕ0 = 0,
aries, equivalent to considering ∂Ψ(ϕ)/∂ϕ
assure that ϕ grows monotonically from 0 to ϕ0 with-
out oscillating back and forth, while the condition
Ψ(ϕ0) = Ψ(0) = 0 assures that ϕ0 remains bounded
without growing indeﬁnitely.

Examining Equation (2), we can thus conclude that
the system supports a monotonic double layer solution,
for a given Mach number, only if the electron pressure
exceeds the ion pressure along the shock, and if both
coincide in value and slope at the boundaries x = xL(ϕ =
0) and x = xL(ϕ = ϕ0). On the other hand, if the
electrostatic potential exceeds the critical value ϕcr =
M 2/2, the ion pressure becomes imaginary, and the wave
‘breaks’ [6]. In order to have a steady state solution, we
must then impose Ψ(ϕcr) > 0 [11]. The inequality can
be written in terms of ion and electron pressures in the
form Pe(M 2/2, Θ, Υ) < PI = M 2, which recovers the
same results obtained by previous authors in the limit of
Θ
1 [6, 7], and that imposes an upper limit
to the Mach number of the shock waves created during
the collision of two plasma slabs with temperature ratio Θ
and density ratio Υ. When M 2

electron pressure Pe(ϕ, Θ, Υ) can be properly expanded
around ϕ = ϕcr, and the expression for the maximum

Equation (3) shows that the collision of two plasma slabs
can give rise to electrostatic collisionless shocks with very
large Mach number, provided that the two slabs have the
appropriate temperature (Θ) and density (Υ) ratios. As
far as we know, no electrostatic shock waves with M > 6
have been predicted before. This diﬀerence arises from
the the fact that the present model includes the variation
of electron pressure not only as a function of the electro-
static potential, but also as function of the temperature
jump, Θ, between the electrons in the downstream and
upstream plasma slabs. When the downstream electrons
have a temperature larger than the upstream electrons,
the electron pressure in the shock is reduced (few elec-
trons are trapped), the maximum electrostatic potential
ϕcr can stabilize to a larger value deﬁned by Θ, and the
maximum Mach number Mmax = √2ϕcr increases ac-
cordingly. Figure 2 shows the theoretical prediction of
the maximum Mach number as a function of Θ, for diﬀer-
ent plasma density ratios Υ. The solid line represents the
collision of two plasma slabs with equal density (Υ = 1),
recovering the classic limit M
3.1 [7, 8] when Θ = 1.
The condition for the minimum Mach number is found
by imposing that the Sagdeev potential is negative at its
minimum. When Θ = 1 and N0L = N0R, the minimum
Mach number is 1, as in the hydrodynamic limit.

predictions, we have performed particle-in-cell simula-
tions using the fully relativistic massively parallel code
OSIRIS 2.0 [19]. The 1D simulations are performed in
the reference frame of the slab L, distance is normal-
ized to c/ωpeL, charge to the electron charge e, mass
to the electron mass me, and time to 1/ωpeL, where
. The box length is 120 c/ωpeL,
ωpeL =
with 32768 cells, 50 particles per cell per species (4

3. The
species), and the time step is ωpeLdt = 3.63
simulations start at ωpeL t = 0, with the slab L occupying
the region x ωpeL/c = [0, 80], and the slab R occupying
the region x ωpeL/c = [80, 120]. In the simulations, the
shock is driven by the slab R, both moving to the left; the
shock and driver velocities are calculated in the frame of
the slab L. The simulations cover a wide range of param-
eters, with the driver velocity varying between Mach 2
and Mach 40. The electrons in the R and L slabs have
temperatures TeR = 1 keV and TeL = 10 eV, respectively,
the temperature ratio is Θ = 100, and the density ratio
is Υ = 3. In such conditions of temperatures and densi-
ties, depending on the velocity of the driver, the theory
predicts the formation of shock waves with Mach number
ranging between 10 and 20 (cf. Figure 2). Figure 3 shows
the comparison between the theoretical and the numer-
ical electrostatic potential ϕ, as a function of the Mach
numbers of the shocks observed in the simulations; such
shocks showed velocities ranging between 10 and 20 times
the ion sound speed, in excellent agreement with the the-
ory. It should be noted that, while no shocks are observed
for drivers (slab R) moving with velocity above Mach 20,
very high Mach number shocks (M
20) are cre-
ated by drivers moving with velocity between Mach 2
and Mach 20. In the simulations, the value of the elec-
trostatic potential has been calculated for well developed
shock structures, i.e. normalized times much larger than
ωpeL t = 1000. Figure 4 shows the typical phase space
p1x1 of the ions from the L slab, at four diﬀerent time
steps. The slab R moves towards the left with M = 15,
and drives an electrostatic shock moving at M = 16.
The electrostatic potential predicted by the theory for
the conditions in our simulation, ϕT = 123, is in very
good agreement with the electrostatic potential obtained
in the simulations, ϕO = 125
5. As the shock struc-
ture propagates, the ions are picked up and accelerated:
a small fraction is reﬂected by the electrostatic potential,
while most of the ions end up with the same speed of the
shock wave. We have also performed simulations of sce-
narios with two identical slabs: in these scenarios, when
colliding at M > 6, no shock formation was observed,
thus conﬁrming that high Mach number shocks are sup-
ported only when the colliding slabs have the appropriate
temperature and density ratios.

with Mach numbers well above previous predictions

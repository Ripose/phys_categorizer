In the long-wavelength limit k = 0, the response function has been investigated with respect to the
external and internal ﬁelds which is expressed by the external and internal conductivity, respectively.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to obtain the current-current correlation func-
tion and the dynamical collision frequency which are compared with analytical expressions. Special
attention is given to the dynamical collision frequency and the description of plasma oscillations
in the case of k = 0. The relation between the external and internal conductivity and to the
current-current correlation function is analyzed.

INTRODUCTION

The treatment of strongly correlated Coulomb systems is a challenge for many-particle theories. It has applications
in diﬀerent ﬁelds such as dense ionic plasmas and the electron-hole plasma in excited semiconductors. Within a
quantum statistical approach, the methods of equilibrium and non-equilibrium Green functions have successfully
been utilized to calculate the properties of dense plasmas, see [1]. However, a problem is the validity of perturbative
approximations when using the Green function approach for strongly correlated systems.

With increasing computer capacities, simulation techniques such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have
been developed to obtain physical quantities from correlation functions, see [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The MD approach
allows the application to large coupling parameters. On the other hand, quantum eﬀects are diﬃcult to include. This
shortcoming is partially cured by considering pseudopotentials which eﬀectively take into account the uncertainty
principle by a short distance modiﬁcation of the Coulomb interaction within the range of the thermal wavelength, see
[1]. More rigorous methods to include quantum eﬀects are wave packet MD simulations [8] or path integral Monte
Carlo calculations [9].

Other points are the ﬁnite particle number and the limited accuracy when solving the equations of motion. The
latter will not be discussed any further. The transition from a ﬁnite system to the thermodynamic limit of an inﬁnite
system can be performed by periodic boundary conditions. The total force on a given particle from all the other
particles in a basic cell, as well as from the inﬁnite array of their periodic images, can be obtained using the standard
Ewald procedure [2, 3].

In the present paper, the long-wavelength limit σ(ω) = limk→0 σ(k, ω) of the dynamical conductivity is considered
for a two-component plasma. According to the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), this transport quantity can
be expressed in terms of equilibrium correlation functions, in particular the auto-correlation function (ACF) of the
electrical current or the ACF of the electrical charge density.
In the literature [10], see also [11], the internal as
well as the external conductivity are introduced, relating the electrical current density to the internal or the external
electrical ﬁeld strength, respectively. We will present the corresponding relations in the following Section II. An
important quantity related to the dynamical conductivity is the dynamical collision frequency ν(ω). Analytical
expressions can be derived in diﬀerent approximations within a perturbative approach, see [12].

Section III deﬁnes the current ACF in the context of MD simulations, and the connection to the collision frequency
is shown. While results from MD simulations and analytical approaches for the structure factor and other frequency
dependent quantities at ﬁnite wavenumber k are in good agreement, see e.g. [2, 7], we will discuss the zero-wavenumber

case of MD simulations which is relevant for the dielectric function ǫ(k = 0, ω) or the dynamical conductivity σ(ω).
Calculations are presented without and including a mean ﬁeld contribution which lead to the external and internal
conductivity, respectively.

Details of the MD simulations are reported in Section IV. Results for the current ACF and the dynamical collision
frequency at parameter values of a strongly coupled plasma are shown and compared with results of the analytical
approach. The inclusion of a mean ﬁeld when performing MD simulations is considered in Section V. The controversy
between the internal and external conductivity in calculating the collision frequency is resolved. Conclusions are
drawn in Section VI.

II. DYNAMICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF THE TWO-COMPONENT PLASMA

We consider a two-component fully ionized neutral plasma, such as a H plasma consisting of electrons and protons,
at temperature T and density n of each component. The interaction is given by the Coulomb potential, and the plasma
is characterised by the nonideality parameter Γ = e2(4πne/3)1/3(4πǫ0kBT )−1 and the degeneracy parameter Θ =
2mekBT ¯h−2(3π2n)−2/3. The linear response to external perturbations in general is presented in various references,
see e.g. [1, 12]. In the following, we will restrict ourselves to relations which are relevant for further discussion.

ﬁeld is given by the response function χ(k, ω). Within linear response theory, χ(k, ω) is related to the equilibrium
correlation function of the longitudinal electrical current density [2, 12]

equation (due to charge conservation), the longitudinal current ACF can also be expressed in terms of the charge
density ACF.

According to the FDT, the response function is related to the dynamical structure factor or the longitudinal part

In Eq. (4), the dynamical collision frequency ν(k, ω) is deﬁned by
a generalized Drude formula where ωpl = (ne2/ǫ0mei)1/2 is the plasma frequency and mei the reduced mass. The
phenomenological Drude model is found from the generalized Drude formula Eq. (4) if the collision frequency is
considered to be a real constant equal to the inverse of the relaxation time τ in momentum phase space.

In contrast to χ(k, ω) and the

The Laplace transform of the current ACF reads

On the basis of this quantity, two diﬀerent results for the conductivity

are derived depending on whether the current densities are considered to be long-wavelength limit of the longitudinal
or transverse case.

Firstly, within the transverse response, the Kubo-Greenwood formula (9) is utilized. The conductivity (15) is then

related to the memory function

Secondly, within longitudinal response, we have to distinguish between the external and the internal conductivity.

If in the long-wavelength limit both ν(ω) and

ν(ω) coincide, the current ACF for the longitudinal and transverse
response cannot be identical. In the following Sections IV,V we will resolve the contradiction between the internal
conductivity as obtained from the current ACF according to (17) and (5) and the transverse conductivity obtained
from the current ACF according to (16) and (9).

IV. SIMULATION TECHNIQUE

In the MD simulation scheme, the Newtonian equations of motion are solved for a system consisting of N singly
charged ions and N electrons exerting Coulomb forces on each other. The ith particle of component c shall be
. This is a classical treatment where the trajectories of each particle are determined. The original
denoted as
Coulomb interaction can be replaced by a pseudopotential, where the short-range part of the interaction is modiﬁed
reﬂecting the quantum character of the interaction. A systematic derivation of a pseudopotential which reproduces
the equilibrium properties has been given by Kelbg, see [1, 15] on the basis of the Slater sum. In particular, we use
the so-called “corrected Kelbg” potential [15]:

For explicit MD simulations, we consider a model plasma consisting of singly charged ions and electrons with
1021 cm−3 at a temperature of T = 33 000 K. This corresponds to recent experiments in dense xenon
density n = 3.8
plasmas [16]. The plasma parameters introduced in Sec. II take the value Γ = 1.28, Θ = 3.2. It is a nondegenerate,
strongly coupled plasma. The computations of the current ACF for the ion-electron mass ratios mi/me = 1836 and
mi/me = 100 show no considerable diﬀerence. Thus the ratio mi/me = 100 is selected for better convergence when
averaging over the conﬁgurations of ions. The total number of particles N = 250 was found to be enough for Γ
1.
Further increase of the number of particles (N = 400) does not aﬀect any simulation results including the mean
interaction energy, equilibrium correlation functions and others. The equilibrium state of the plasma at the given
temperature was obtained using a special procedure described in [5].

The current ACF is calculated directly from the velocities of the particles in subsequent moments of time according
to Eqs. (11) and (12), where Ω0 = L3 with L the length of the basic cell. The averaging of the ACF is performed
105 initial conﬁgurations. These conﬁgurations are obtained from a long MD trajectory at diﬀerent time
over (1
moments. As shown in [6], two conﬁgurations are statistically independent if they are taken at times separated by

Results are shown in Fig. 1 with circles. The relatively small ion-electron mass ratio (mi/me = 100) was chosen
for computational reasons since the calculation with greater mass ratio shows exactly the same results for the current
ACF. The current ACF K(t) decreases monotonously as it was also obtained in previous MD simulations [2, 4, 6]. It
indicates that the conductivity obtained numerically from K(t) according to (15) should be treated as the transverse
conductivity (8). The dimensionless dynamical conductivity σ(ω)/(ǫ0ωpl) is shown in Fig. 2 with circles. As ω
0,
the real part has a ﬁnite value and the imaginary part vanishes, as expected from Eq. (16). According to the latter
expression, we then deduct a memory function or collision frequency

ν(ω) as shown in Fig. 3 with circles.

We will now compare the MD simulations with this analytical treatment of the dynamical collision frequency
within perturbation theory, see Figs. 4. Firstly, we consider a system with statically screened Coulomb interaction
˜V (q) = e2/(Ω0ǫ0q2) according to Eq. (23). The results are presented as dotted line. The Born approximation can be
improved by taking into account the eﬀects of dynamically screening, strong collisions (T matrix) and higher moments
by introducing a renormalization factor [12] in the generalized Drude formula Eq. (4). This approximation is shown
as solid line. Details of the calculation are given in [12]. It can be seen that both real and imaginary part are in good
agreement with the simulation results for ω < ωpl. This means that in this region the quantum mechanical treatment
of the Coulomb potential and the classical simulations based on the corrected Kelbg potential are consistent.

V. LONGITUDINAL CONDUCTIVITY

We now investigate the evaluation of the longitudinal conductivity by MD simulations. The current ACF K trans
discussed in the previous Section cannot be taken since this current ACF yields the correct collision frequency only if
the external conductivity is related to a Drude ansatz. However, this is not consistent. Instead we have to derive the
internal conductivity, from which a collision frequency can be obtained via the Drude formula. Therefore, the current
ACF K long has to be calculated diﬀerently than the ACF K trans. It will be shown how to obtain the longitudinal
current ACF in the long-wavelength limit. However, we note that for ﬁnite wavevector k excellent agreement for
the dynamical structure factor from MD simulation and analytical expressions has been found [7]. The condition
k > 2π/L means that any charge density wave occurs already within the basic simulation cell and the corresponding
mean electric ﬁeld is accurately taken into account. The limit k
0 is not trivial. For any small k, the system
is nearly homogeneous, but charge densities (or surface densities) are present at large distances, which can also be
considered as a mean ﬁeld.

→

(2Nimages + 1)

For this, we follow the procedure to construct an inﬁnite system by periodic images of a basic cell. We consider
this as a limiting case of a ﬁnite number of images. Denoting the images in z-direction by Nimages, then a surface
of our system is obtained at z− =
L/2. When considering the force
calculation procedure, there are contributions to the forces originating from a surface charge density. This occurs if
positive and negative charges are moving at diﬀerent rates across the surface of the basic cell. The introduction of a
ﬁnite number of images compensates this eﬀect at the interfaces, but not at the surface of the whole system including
all the images. A large dipole moment follows connected with a ﬁnite polarization of the system. This surface charge
density will produce an electrical ﬁeld which has to be taken into account even in the limit when the number of images
goes to inﬁnity. If the surface is far away, it produces a homogeneous electrical ﬁeld ~E(t) within the simulation box.
Following this reasoning, it is necessary to include a mean ﬁeld in the long-wavelength limit as shown below. As a
consequence, plasma oscillations are obtained in the current ACF.

The force ~ξ includes only electron-ion interaction forces as all electron-electron interaction forces are compensated
since they do not change the total momentum of the electrons. Although the force ~F short
on each electron is typically
much greater than the force e ~E from the mean electric ﬁeld, the average over all electrons is of the same order of
magnitude as e ~E. If we now diﬀerentiate Eq. (26) and substitute the derivative of the current using (30), we obtain

On an average, ~ξ vanishes, so that plasma oscillations are described. The corresponding oscillations in the current

We now present MD simulations based on the solution of the equations of motion (28) in comparison to the MD

simulations as presented in the previous Sec. IV where the contribution of the mean ﬁeld
account. The energy conservation is demonstrated in Fig. 5 according to Eq. (29). It can also be seen that the ﬁeld

Results for the longitudinal and transverse current ACF are shown in Fig. 1. After including the mean ﬁeld into the
MD simulations, the plasma oscillations in K(t) become well pronounced in contrast to a monotonously decreasing
behaviour. It should be stressed that the amplitude of these oscillations does not depend on N .

The conductivity calculated according to Eq. (15) is shown in Fig. 2. In comparison to the transverse case, the
conductivity shows a qualitatively diﬀerent behaviour. The real part following from the MD simulations including
mean ﬁeld is zero for zero frequency as is expected from the expression for the external conductivity (6). For the
case without mean ﬁeld, Re σ has a ﬁnite value. In the high frequency limit, both curves coincide. The dynamical
ν(ω) calculated from the simulation data for the ACFs are shown
collision frequencies ν(ω) and the memory function

e

in Fig. 3. As pointed out, the results for the Laplace transform of the ACF diﬀer signiﬁcantly (Figs. 2). Nevertheless,
if Eq. (18) is used for the collision frequency ν(ω) and Eq. (16) for the memory function
ν(ω) in order to calculate
the collision frequency, the results for both coincide quite clearly (Fig. 3).

Therefore, our analysis showed that the contradiction between the transverse conductivity which should be identical
with the internal conductivity in the long-wavelength limit and the external conductivity could be resolved if the mean
ﬁeld is taken into account. The diﬀerence between Im ν(ω) and Im
ν(ω) in the low frequency limit is caused by the
numerical error of Im ν(ω) due to substraction of two large terms in Eq. (18).

VI. CONCLUSION

Molecular dynamics simulations of strongly coupled plasmas were performed using the quasiclassical Kelbg inter-
action potential. The current auto-correlation function was computed for a non-degenerate two-component plasma.
Whereas for ﬁnite k the dynamical structure factor and the plasma oscillations are reproduced by MD simulations,
see [2, 4, 7], the original methods do not allow to consider k values with k < 2π/L. On the other hand k = 0 should
be possible to investigate with MD simulations in a ﬁnite volume.

We presented calculations for the transverse current ACF as well as for the longitudinal one. Although in the limit
k
0 the transverse and longitudinal dielectric function and conductivities, respectively, coincide, the current ACF
behave diﬀerently in this limiting case. It was shown that the results of MD simulations without a mean ﬁeld in the
long wavelength limit provide the monotonously decreasing transverse ACF. Its Laplace transform is to be directly
related to the transversal conductivity.

In MD simulations for the longitudinal case, a mean-ﬁeld term has to be included into the equations of motion in
addition to the short range forces inside the Debye sphere. This mean-ﬁeld term originates from surface charges not
taken into account in the usual procedure of force calculation by the nearest image method. Simulations with these
altered equations of motion show well pronounced plasma oscillations in the longitudinal current ACF. The results
for the collision frequency as obtained in both simulation methods using the corresponding relations for the internal
or external conductivities do coincide.

Additionally, the dynamical collision frequency inferred from the simulation data was compared with analytical
results, which were derived using a generalized linear response theory. We found good agreement in the low and high
frequency limits for a moderate nonideality. In particular, for ω < ωpl, classical MD simulations using the corrected
Kelbg potential are able to reproduce the quantum behaviour of Coulomb plasmas.

An analytical model is presented for the description of nonlinear dust-ion-acoustic waves propa-
gating in an unmagnetized, collisionless, three component plasma composed of electrons, ions and
inertial dust grains. The formulation relies on a Lagrangean approach of the plasma ﬂuid model. The
modulational stability of the wave amplitude is investigated. Diﬀerent types of localized envelope
electrostatic excitations are shown to exist.

INTRODUCTION

In the last two decades, dusty plasmas (DP) have at-
tracted a great deal of attention due to a variety of
new phenomena observed in them and the novel physical
mechanisms involved in their description [1, 2]. In addi-
tion to known plasma electrostatic modes [3], new oscil-
latory modes arise in DP [1, 2], among which the dust-ion
acoustic wave (DIAW) and dust acoustic waves (DAW)
are of signiﬁcant interest in laboratory dusty plasma dis-
charges. In the DIAW the restoring force comes from the
pressures of inertialess electrons, whereas the ion mass
provides the inertia, similar to the usual ion-acoustic
waves in an electron- ion plasma. Thus, the DIAW is
characterized by a phase speed much smaller (larger)
than the ion (electron) thermal speed, and a frequency
much higher than the dust plasma frequency ωp,d; there-
fore, on the timescale of our interest, stationary dust
grains do not participate in the wave dynamics; they just
aﬀect the equilibrium quasi-neutrality condition. As a
matter of fact, the DIAW phase velocity is higher than
that of IA waves, due to the electron density depletion in
the background plasma when dust grains are negatively
charged; quite remarkably, this fact results in suppression
of the Landau damping mechanism [1], known to prevail
over the IAW propagation in an electron-ion plasma [3].

The linear properties of the IAWs have been quite ex-
tensively studied and now appear well understood [1].
As far as nonlinear eﬀects are concerned, various stud-
ies have pointed out the possibility of the formation of
DIAW-related localized structures, due to a mutual com-
pensation between nonlinearity and dispersion, including
small-amplitude pulse solitons, shocks and vortices [4].

Furthermore, the propagation of nonlinearly modulated
DIA wave packets was studied in Ref.
[5], in addition
to the formation of localized envelope soliton–modulated
waves due to the modulational instability of the carrier
waves. A very interesting known approach, not yet in-
cluded in our current knowledge with respect to the DIA
plasma waves, is the Lagrangean description of a nonlin-
ear wave proﬁle. In the context of electrostatic plasma
waves, this formalism has been employed in studies of
electron plasma waves [6, 7, 8] and, more recently, ion-
acoustic [9] and dust-acoustic [10] waves. Our aim here
is to extend previous results by applying the Lagrangean
formalism to the description of nonlinear DIAWs propa-
gating in dusty plasmas.

We shall consider the nonlinear propagation of dust-
ion-acoustic waves in a collisionless plasma consisting of
three distinct particle species ‘α’: an inertial species of
ions (denoted by ‘i’; mass mi, charge qi = +Zie; e de-
notes the absolute of the electron charge), surrounded
by an environment of thermalized electrons (mass me,
charge
e), and massive dust grains (mass M , charge
qd = sZde, both assumed constant for simplicity); Zd de-
notes the charge state of dust grains; we leave the choice
of dust grain charge sign s = qd/
1/ + 1 for neg-
qd|
|
ative/positive dust charge) open in the algebra. Charge
neutrality is assumed at equilibrium.

equations which describe the evolution of the ion ‘ﬂuid’
in the plasma. The ion number density ni is governed by
the continuity equation

A. Reduced Eulerian equations

By choosing appropriate physical scales, Eqs. (1)-(3)
can be cast into a reduced (dimensionless) form. Let
us deﬁne the ion-acoustic speed cs = (kBTe/mi)1/2.
An appropriate choice for the space and timescales, L
and T = L/cs, are the eﬀective Debye length λD =
i ni,0e2)1/2
(kBTe/4πZ 2

≡

1/2, respectively. Alter-
i e2/mi)−
p,i = (4πni,0Z 2
riod ω−
natively, one might leave the choice of L (and thus
T = L/cs) arbitrary – following an idea suggested in
Refs.
[9, 10]) – which leads to the appearance of a di-
mensionless dispersion parameter δ = 1/(ωp,iT ) = λD/L
in the formulae. The speciﬁc choice of scale made above
corresponds to δ = 1 (implied everywhere in the follow-
ing, unless otherwise stated); however, we may keep the
parameter δ to ‘label’ the dispersion term in the forth-
coming formulae.

For one-dimensional wave propagation along the x

n and ˆn reduce to unity at equilibrium.

≡

We note that the dependence on the charge sign s is
now incorporated in µ = 1 + sZdnd,0/(Zini,0); retain
that µ < 1 (µ > 1) corresponds to negative (positive)
dust. Remarkably, since the dust-free limit is recovered
for µ = 1, the results to be obtained in the following are
also straightforward valid for ion-acoustic waves propa-
gating in (dust-free) e-i plasma, upon setting µ = 1 in
the formulae.

The well–known DIAW dispersion relation ω2 =

(1) to (5).
D + 1) [5] is obtained from Eqs.
On the other hand, the system (6) yields the reduced re-
lation ω2 = k2/(δ2k2 + 1), which of course immediately
recovers the former dispersion relation upon restoring di-
mensions (regardless, in fact, of one’s choice of space scale
L; cf. deﬁnition of δ). However, some extra qualitative
information is admittedly hidden in the latter (dimen-
sionless) relation. Should one consider a very long space

As a matter of fact, the Lagrangean transformation de-
ﬁned here reduces to a Galilean transformation if one
suppresses the evolution of u, i.e.
for u = const. (or
∂u/∂τ = ∂u/∂ξ = 0, hence α = 1). Furthermore, if

one also suppresses the dependence in time τ , this trans-
formation is reminiscent of the travelling wave ansatz
s), which is widely used in the

Eq.

Note that a factor δ2 should appear in the left-hand side
if one rescaled Eq. (16) as described above; cf. the last
of Eqs.
(6). This will be retained for later reference,
with respect to the treatment suggested in Ref. [9] (see
discussion below).

In principle, our aim is to solve the system of Eqs.
(12) to (15) or, by eliminating φ, Eqs. (12), (13) and
(16) for a given initial condition n(ξ, τ = 0) = n0(ξ),
and then make use of the deﬁnition (9) in order to invert
back to the Eulerian arguments of the state moment vari-
ables (i.e. density, velocity etc.). However, this abstract
scheme is deﬁnitely not a trivial task to accomplish.

ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) – since all variables
depend on both time τ and space ξ – nor a closed evo-
lution equation for the mean velocity u(ξ, τ ): note that
the (normalized) background particle density ˆn depends
on the potential φ and on the plasma parameters; see its
deﬁnition (7). The evolution of the potential φ(ξ, τ ), in
turn, involves u(ξ, τ ) (via the quantity α(ξ, τ )) and the
ion density n(ξ, τ ).

Eq. (18) suggests that the system performs nonlinear
oscillations at a frequency ω = ωp,i ˆn1/2. Near equilib-
rium, the quantity ˆn is approximately equal to unity and
one plainly recovers a linear oscillation at the ion plasma
frequency ωp,i. Quite unfortunately this apparent sim-
plicity, which might in principle enable one to solve for
u(ξ, τ ) and then obtain

versa (cf. Davidson’s treatment for electron plasma os-
cillations in Ref.
[8], setting
γ = 0 therein), is absent in the general (oﬀ-equilibrium)
case where the plasma oscillations described by Eq. (18)
are intrinsically nonlinear.

in terms of

{

{

Since Eq. (18) is in general not a closed equation for
u, unless the background density ˆn is constant (i.e.
in-
dependent of φ, as in Refs. [7, 8]), one can neither apply
standard methods involved in the description of nonlin-
ear oscillators on Eq. (18) (cf. Ref. [8]), nor reduce the
description to a study of Eqs. (18, 17) (cf. Ref.
[6]),
but rather has to retain all (or rather ﬁve) of the evolu-
tion equations derived above, since ﬁve inter-dependent
dynamical state variables (i.e. n, u, E, φ and α) are in-
volved. This procedure will be exposed in the following
Section.

and substituting into the system of evolution equations,
one obtains an inﬁnite series in both (perturbation or-

straightforward; the details of the method are presented
e.g. in Ref. [5], so only the essential stepstones need to

B. Finite amplitude nonlinear excitations

The NLSE (22) is long known to possess distinct types
of localized constant proﬁle (solitary wave) solutions, de-
pending on the sign of the product P Q [5, 15, 16]. Re-
member that this equation here describes the evolution
of the wave’s envelope, so these solutions represent slowly
varying localized envelope structures, conﬁning the (fast)
carrier wave. The analytic form of these excitation can be
found in the literature (see e.g. in [5] for a brief review)
and need not be derived here in detail. Let us however
brieﬂy summarize those results.

Following Ref. [16], we may seek a solution of Eq. (22)
in the form ψ(ζ, τ ) = ρ(Z, T ) ei Θ(ζ,τ )+c.c., where ρ, σ are
real variables which are determined by substituting into
the NLSE and separating real and imaginary parts. The
diﬀerent types of solution thus obtained are summarized
in the following.

For P Q > 0 we ﬁnd the (bright) envelope soliton

which represents a localized pulse travelling at the enve-

The pulse width L depends on the maximum amplitude
square ρ0 as L = (2P /Q)1/2/ρ0. Since the product P Q
is always positive for long wavelengths, as we saw above,
this type of excitation will be rather privileged in dusty
plasmas. The bright-type envelope soliton is depicted in
Fig. 1a, b.

For P Q < 0, we obtain the dark envelope soliton (hole)

An important qualitative result to be retained is that
the envelope soliton width L and maximum amplitude
P/Q (see above), and thus depend on
ρ satisfy Lρ
(the ratio of) the coeﬃcients P and Q; for instance, re-
gions with higher values of P (or lower values of Q) will
support wider (spatially more extended) localized exci-
tations, for a given value of the maximum amplitude.
Contrary to the KdV soliton picture, the width of these
excitations does not depend on their velocity.
It does,
however, depend on the plasma parameters, e.g. here µ.

The localized envelope excitations presented above
represent the slowly varying envelope which conﬁnes the
φ =
(fast) carrier space and time oscillations, viz.
Ψ(X, Z) cos(kξ
ωτ ) for the electric potential φ (and
analogous expressions for the density ni etc.; cf. (21)).
The qualitative characteristics (width, amplitude) of
these excitations, may be investigated by a numerical
η(k; µ): recall that its sign de-
study of the ratio P/Q
termines the type (bright or dark) of the excitation, while
its (absolute) value determines its width for a given am-
plitude (and vice versa). In Fig. 2 we have depicted the
behaviour of η as a function of the wavenumber k and
the parameter µ: higher values of µ correspond to lower
curves. Remember that, for any given wavenumber k,
the dust concentration (expressed via the value of µ) de-
termines the soliton width L (for a given amplitude ρ;
η1/2/ρ. Therefore, we
see discussion above) since L
see that the addition of negative dust generally (µ < 1)
results to higher values of η (i.e. wider or higher soli-
tons), while positive dust (µ > 1) has the opposite eﬀect:
it reduces the value of η (leading to narrower or shorter
solitons). In a rather general manner, bright type soli-
tons (pulses) seem to be rather privileged, since the ratio
η (or the product P Q) of the coeﬃcients P and Q is pos-
itive in most of the k, µ plane of values. One exception
seems to be very the region of very low values of µ (typ-
ically below 0.2), which develops a negative tail of η for
small k (< 0.3 kD): thus, a very high (> 80 per cent) elec-
tron depletion results in pulse destabilization in favour of
dark-type excitations (Fig. 1c, d). Strictly speaking, η
also becomes negative for very high wave number values
(> 2.5 kD); nevertheless, we neglect – for rigor – this re-
gion from the analysis, in this (long wavelength λ) ﬂuid
picture (for a weak dust presence, short λ DIAWs may
be quite strongly damped; however, this result may still
be interesting for a strong presence of dust, when Landau
damping is not a signiﬁcant issue [1]).

Despite its complex form, the nonlinear evolution

ferent special cases, as regards the order of magnitude
of the dispersion–related parameter δ. This treatment,
based on Ref. [9], will only be brieﬂy summarized here,

cedure, which is essentially analogue (yet not identical)
to Davidson’s treatment of electron plasma oscillations.

n(ξ, τ ) = n1(ξ)n2(τ ) [13]. This calculation was put for-
ward in Ref.
[9] (where the study of IAW – in a single
electron temperature plasma – was argued to rely on an
equation quasi-identical to Eq. (27)). However, the so-
lution thus obtained relies on doubtful physical grounds,
since the assumption δ
0, which amounts to remaining
close to equilibrium – cf. the last of Eqs. (6), implies an
inﬁnite space scale L (recall the deﬁnition of δ), contrary
to the very nature of the (localized) nonlinear excitation
itself. Rather not surprisingly, this solution was shown
in Ref.
[9] to decay fast in time, in both Eulerian and
Lagrangean coordinates. Therefore, we shall not pursue
this analysis any further.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the nonlinear propagation of dust ion
acoustic waves propagating in a dusty plasma. By em-
ploying a Lagrangean formalism, we have investigated
the modulational stability of the amplitude of the propa-
gating dust ion acoustic oscillations and have shown that
these electrostatic waves may become unstable, due to
self interaction of the carrier wave. This instability may
either lead to wave collapse or to wave energy localiza-
tion, in the form of propagating localized envelope struc-
tures. We have provided an exact set of analytical ex-
pressions for these localized excitations.

This study complements similar investigations which
relied on an Eulerian formulation of the dusty plasma
ﬂuid model [5].
In fact, the Lagrangean picture pro-
vides a strongly modiﬁed nonlinear stability proﬁle for
the wave amplitude, with respect to the previous (Eule-
rian) description; this was intuitively expected, since the
passing to Lagrangean variables involves an inherently
nonlinear transformation, which inevitably modiﬁes the
nonlinear evolution proﬁle of the system described. How-
ever, the general qualitative result remains in tact: the
dust ion acoustic-type electrostatic plasma waves may
propagate in the form of localized envelope excitations,
which are formed as a result of the mutual balance be-
tween dispersion and nonlinearity in the plasma ﬂuid.
More sophisticated descriptions, incorporating e.g. ther-
mal or collisional eﬀects, may be elaborated in order to
reﬁne the parameter range of the problem, and may be
reported later.

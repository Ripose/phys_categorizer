Abstract

Arcade-type magnetic ﬁeld structures originating from the photosphere are relevant to the un-

derstanding of diﬀerent types of solar prominences, coronal loops and coronal heating. In most of

the existing literature, these loop-like magnetic structures are modeled as force-free ﬁelds (FFF)

without any plasma ﬂow. The system is assumed to be isolated and non-dissipative. In reality

the photospheric plasma hardly qualiﬁes to be isolated in nature and the existence of an external

drive in the form of a dynamo ﬁeld is always possible. Solar prominences are not ideal either since

dissipative eﬀects are believed to play a major role in coronal heating. The above observations

indicate that a force-free model based on a non-dissipative plasma may not be a suitable candidate

to replicate the arcade structures and further investigations are required. In our work, we have

proposed the arcade structures as minimum dissipative relaxed states (including both the viscous

and resistive channels) pertaining to a two-ﬂuid description of the plasma. The obtained relaxed

state is non force-free in nature and appropriate to an open system with external drives. The

Euler-Lagrange equations are solved in Cartesian coordinates subject to the existing photospheric

boundary conditions. The solutions are seen to support ﬂow-containing arcade like magnetic ﬁeld

conﬁgurations with inherent dissipative properties that may play an important role in the coronal

heating. An interesting feature observed is the generation of diﬀerent types of arcades with the

variation of a single parameter characterizing the relaxed state. Also, recent observations with the

LASCO coronagraph on board the SOHO spacecraft suggest that the helmet streamers originating

from the sun may have an internal triple-arcade structure. The two-ﬂuid relaxed state obtained

here is also seen to support such structures.

INTRODUCTION

Arcade type magnetic structures play an essential role in solar physics, particularly re-

garding the coronal loops, coronal heating and coronal mass ejection. A typical coronal loop

consists of a bunch or a single arch-like magnetic ﬁeld line(s) joining two magnetically active

regions of opposite polarity on the photosphere [1, 2]. The active regions themselves are

separated by a neutral line, where the normal component of the magnetic ﬁeld is zero. In

general the coronal loops are observed to be long-lived. By long-lived we mean the life-time

of the structure involved is more than that expected from a conventional magnetohydrody-

namic (MHD) analysis. The coronal loops are seen to have life-times varying from an hour

to more than one day [3] whereas the MHD time scale for a typical loop parameter is of the

order of seconds [4] only.

The global structure of the magnetic arcades are modelled either by assuming a potential

(current-free) ﬁeld [5] or by considering the plasma to be force-free [6, 7, 8, 9] and the

magnetic ﬁeld satisfying the equation

B = λB

∇ ×

(1)

with λ as a spatial function or a constant. The ﬀf model is justiﬁed by an an order of

magnitude analysis that shows the structures to be of low β [10] or on arguments similar

to that of Taylor in the context of laboratory plasmas [11, 12], where it is envisioned as

a relaxed state characterized by the magnetic energy minimum along with an invariant

magnetic helicity [6, 7]. The second scheme appears to be more lucrative, since by deﬁnition

it makes the arcade structures long-lived and at the same time imparts a sense of stability to

them. This stems from the fact that the relaxed state being a spontaneously achieved state,

any deviation from it is expected to generate the same mechanisms that were responsible to

attain the relaxed state at the very ﬁrst place. As a result, the system will once again try

to converge to its earlier state and the perturbations will die out. In other words, there is

always an anticipation that the relaxed states are also inherently stable by nature. But this

is only an expectation and a detail analysis [13, 14] is always required to study the relevant

stability properties.

Although the force-free description is successful in explaining the gross topological fea-

tures of the magnetic arcades but at the same time also suﬀers from major drawbacks. As

2

observed through EUV spectrum [3] the plasma temperature has a monotonically increasing

proﬁle inside the loop being minimum at the axis and maximum at the surface. The density

shows no signiﬁcant variation transverse to the loop axis [4] and even can be considered to

be uniform [15]. These observations imply that the pressure is not an uniform parameter

inside the loop and a force-free description may not be an appropriate candidate to model

the arcade. In a recent work by G. A. Gary [16] it has been recognized that the solar corona

itself has regions of diﬀerent plasma β. It is only the mid-corona sandwiched between the

photosphere at the base of the coronal loop and the upper-corona where the plasma β << 1

and the force-free condition can be assumed to hold good. The other two regions are essen-

tially characterized by β > 1 and hence support non force-free ﬁelds. Based on the SXT

Limb Data [17], Gary has proposed a model that admits a range of β values in the mid

corona. Also in an alternative scenario the solar ﬂares are proposed to be natural conse-

quence of the high β plasma conﬁned in a curved coronal loop [18]. The above-mentioned

works essentially points that a force-free model is not adequate in explaining all the features

of arcade ﬁelds and a non force-free description is highly desirable.

Another feature missing in the force-free description of the arcade ﬁelds is the plasma ﬂow.

In all the force-free models mentioned above, the plasma is assumed to be ideal or nearly

ideal. This essentially decouples the magnetic and ﬂow ﬁelds, making them independent of

each other. In contrast to this ﬁnite plasma ﬂows have been observed in the coronal loops

[19], a typical form being the Evershed ﬂow which is directed out of the sunspots at the

photosphere and into them in the chromosphere [20]. A ﬁnite pressure diﬀerence between

the foot points is believed to be responsible for such ﬂows. Flows are important in context

of the solar winds also where the plasma is seen to ﬂow outwards along the open ﬁeld lines.

The importance of ﬂow has recently been recognized by Mahajan et. al. [21] also. According

to them viscous dissipation does play an important role as long as the ﬂow ﬁeld is treated

as an integral part of the plasma dynamics and accounts for the coronal heating during the

very formation of the loops.

From the above discussions it emerges that although the force-free model is suitable in

explaining the gross topological features of the arcade-type magnetic ﬁelds, further studies

must be made in order to accommodate features such as non-uniform pressure proﬁle and

ﬁnite plasma ﬂow. To include such features, in the following we propose the arcade ﬁelds as

driven relaxed states governed by the principle of minimum dissipation rate (MDR). Before

3

going any further, we want to declare that our goal is rather modest and is conﬁned only

to the feasibility study of the arcade structures as MDR relaxed state. In this paper we

will be more concerned with the general topological features and leave all the quantitative

analysis; like the heating rate or the magnitude of the plasma ﬂow for future works. Also

for analytical progress, essential in understanding the natural coupling of the self-consistent

magnetic ﬁelds and non-zero plasma ﬂows, we will assume the density to be constant. The

situations where such an assumption is valid being already been discussed by Mahajan et.

al [21], no further clariﬁcations are given here.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

To formulate a variational problem for obtaining the relaxed state, we need a minimizer

(minimization of which yields the relaxed state) and invariants or constraints that essen-

tially determines how far the system will be propped away from its trivial outcome. A

crucial point to be noted is, most of the arcade ﬁelds, including the solar corona, are exter-

nally driven magnetoplasma systems. For the solar corona, the external drive is provided

by the convective motions in the bounding photospheric surface penetrated by the coronal

magnetic ﬁeld [22]. With dissipative processes playing a key role [21], such systems are not

in thermodynamic equilibrium and we have to look for suitable minimizers and invariants.

Principle of minimum dissipation rate ﬁrst proposed by Montgomery and Philips in the con-

text of plasma physics [23] is one of the suitable candidates to describe such oﬀ-equilibrium

magnetoplasma systems related to various fusion oriented conﬁgurations [24, 25, 26] (and

the references therein). We must point out that in absence of a rigorous mathematical proof,

principle of MDR still enjoys the status of a conjecture- the validity of which depends on

the agreement of predictions based on it with the experimental observations. The success

of MDR in predicting experimentally realizable relaxed states in laboratory plasmas makes

it a viable candidate for the astrophysical plasmas also.

In the following we describe the plasma by two-ﬂuid equations. This has two basic

advantages over its single-ﬂuid or MHD counterpart. In two-ﬂuid description, at-least in

context of the relaxation physics, plasma ﬂow gets coupled to the magnetic ﬁeld in a natural

way. Also, the two-ﬂuid description being more general than MHD, it is expected to capture

certain results that are otherwise unattainable from a single-ﬂuid description. In two-ﬂuid

4

formalism the magnetic helicity is replaced by the generalized helicities deﬁned as

Pα ·
where Pα and Ωα are the canonical momentum and canonical vorticity for the α species and

are given by

As can easily be acknowledged, the expression for Kα in equation (2) is gauge independent

ˆn = 0 is satisﬁed. Such a boundary condition makes the

inherently driven systems [22], we must modify the above deﬁnition of generalized helicity.

An alternative expression for the generalized helicity can be found by extending the deﬁnition

of Jensen and Chu [27] to the two-ﬂuid case. Let us deﬁne [28]

Kα =

Ωαdτ

where Pα and P′

where the surface integral is to be evaluated over the bounding surface S of the volume V .

In writing the above equation we have used the Gauss’ theorem along with the fact that

aﬀect the other, we have

While deriving the above equation, we have used the boundary condition described by

equation (6).

In the above balance equation the surface integrals represent the helicity

injection terms while the volume integral represents the dissipation rate for Kα. For an
isolated system characterized by Ω′

P = 0 (the last condition is

ˆn = 0 and ˆn

ˆn = 0, uα ·

due to the fact that in isolated systems with conducting material boundary, ˆn

ui = 0 which is the no-slip boundary condition and is applicable to viscous systems), only

×

the dissipation term in the balance equation survives and for a static plasma characterized

by uα = 0 is similar to the dissipation rate of the magnetic helicity.

To proceed further, in the following we consider a two-component hydrogen plasma.

In writing the last expression we have neglected the electron viscosity over the ion viscosity

due to its smallness by the electron to ion mass ratio.

Following Montgomery et al [23], let us assume that K is a bounded function. Then the

time average of K over a reasonably long time will make left side of the above equation a

constant. Prescribing the surface terms [29] then it is possible to form a variational problem

where the relaxed state is obtained by minimizing the total dissipation rates, both ohmic

and viscous, with the helicity dissipation rates as constraints. In other words, in our model

we have assumed the ﬁeld variables to be ﬁxed at the surface. This assumption is more

of a mathematical requirement to keep the subsequent analysis simple and at per with the

variational principle in classical mechanics. The minimization integral is then obtained as,

A few comments are necessary for the above set of equations. For a constant gauge, the

equations reduce to the double-curl Beltrami equations obtained by Mahajan and Yoshida

[30]. Also the equations are in some sense robust to a variation in the Prandtl number. For
both the limits Li →
curl nature. As the ﬁnite Li case also includes the ideal limit (η

and for ﬁnite Li the equations maintain their double-

0 and Li → ∞

0), this shows

that the ﬂow does play an important role in securing a relaxed as well as a steady-state in

the ideal limit, as conjectured by Montgomery and Philips [23].

III. SOLUTION OF THE EL EQUATIONS: ARCADE STRUCTURES

To obtain solutions of the EL equations pertaining to arcade structures let us employ the

cartesian coordinates. We assume that the x

y plane represents the photospheric surface

and arcade structures are extended to the positive half z

plane. So our volume of interest

is the region characterized by the positive values of z coordinate.

A point to be mentioned is, as the boundary conditions (6) or (7) has to be obeyed at all

the points on the x

y plane, we have no other option but to assume that this condition is

satisﬁed automatically. In other words we are assuming the photospheric ﬁelds are to be of

the same form as the above set of equations with z = 0. In the above set for B if we put α =

E = 0, the corresponding magnetic ﬁeld represents the photospheric boundary conditions

used by Finn et. al.

[32]. Here, we are assuming a more general but structurally similar

photospheric boundary condition. Equations (6) or (7) then do not yield any condition

through which diﬀerent parameters can be determined. To establish the possibility that the

MDR relaxed state does support meaningful ﬂow-containing non force-free arcade structures,

in the following we consider the simplest two-dimensional non force-free state described by

the condition,

For such a choice, diﬀerent ﬁeld components can be written as,

As we have pointed out earlier, the resulting magnetic ﬁeld is two-dimensional with By = 0.

This is just a simpliﬁed case and more elaborate three-dimensional magnetic ﬁelds can be

obtained for other choices of the eigenvalues. But, here our objective is rather modest;

to model and look for arcade-type magnetic ﬁelds as possible MDR states. To do that a

two-dimensional magnetic ﬁeld would suﬃce. The third dimension essentially adds twist to

the magnetic ﬁeld lines and is believed to be responsible for S-shaped solar prominences

[9, 31]. We leave this as our future work. The Arcade structures are obtained by solving

the magnetic ﬁeld line equation,

and are depicted in ﬁgures (1)-(5) for diﬀerent γ values. It is interesting to observe that

along with the single-arcade structure, the MDR relaxed state also supports multiple-arcade

solutions. The triple-arcade solutions are particularly interesting as recent observations with

the LASCO coronagraph on board the SOHO spacecraft suggest that the helmet streamers

originating from the sun may have an internal structure similar to that [33, 34]. The observed

triple-arcade structures existed for several days and occasionally went unstable leading to

a new and extraordinarily huge kind of coronal mass ejection (CME). Although a direct

method for predicting CMEs is not included in our model, but following Bellan [31] a

rough qualitative scenario for the same can be visualized. According to Bellan [31] the

loss of equilibrium occurs when the altitudinal decay factor γ in equations (46) satisﬁes the

condition

14

γ

1

≤

(48)

For γ

1 the magnetic ﬁelds no longer decay with increasing height from the solar surface

≤

but are oscillatory in nature. In the footsteps of Bellan, we may also propose the following.

As γ decreases the arcades passes from more stable to unstable states and as the instability

threshold is crossed, loss of equilibrium occurs with erupting prominences. In other words,

this model requires the multiple-arcade structures to be more stable compared to their single-

arcade counterparts and indeed, in a recent work based on resistive MHD, Wiegelmann et

al have shown that triple streamers are usually more stable than a single streamer [35].

Alongside, we want to put a word of caution. The argument presented here is only qualitative

and indicates that the MDR relaxed state has the potential to incorporate the phenomenon

of CME. An actual stability calculation for the states described by equations (46) can decide

the issue.

Although, equation (20) supports ﬁeld-aligned ﬂows as a non-unique solution obtained

with a special gauge, in the following we look for more general solutions. Diﬀerent ﬂow

components can be calculated by realizing,

To obtain β and F we need additional boundary conditions on ﬂow, which are not available

at this time. Actually by demanding uy to be zero at the edge, one of the constants may be

calculated but the other remains still unspeciﬁed. Also, we have to look about the matter

that in our calculations we have obtained By = 0 with a non-zero uy. In solar physics it

is hypothesized that due to the shear ﬂow (the y-component) the footprints of the arcades

move on the x

y plane.

If so, we must generate a 3D magnetic ﬁeld with non-zero y-

component. Then the choice λ1 =

Figure (6) shows the x-variation of uz for single-arcade solution with γ = 1.5. The

direction ﬂips sign at the summit of the arcade and hence resembles an evershed ﬂow. The

corresponding ﬂow lines are depicted in ﬁgure (7).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, in this work we have proposed a formulation suitable to obtain externally

driven relaxed states in two-ﬂuid plasma. The ﬁnal relaxed state is obtained by utilizing the

principle of minimum dissipation rate (MDR), which is appropriate for such systems. One

novel feature of this formalism is the presence of non-trivial ﬂow ﬁeld coupling that is absent

in the corresponding single-ﬂuid MDR states. The Euler-Lagrange equations obtained are

double-curl in nature and represent non force-free conﬁguration. For a constant gauge this

reduces to the double curl Beltrami equation obtained by Mahajan and Yoshida [21, 30].

Since the double-curl Beltrami equation represents one of the steady states of the ideal

plasma, this highlights the possible role of the non-zero plasma ﬂow in securing a steady, as

well as, MDR relaxed state.

To establish the plausibility of MDR principle in predicting arcade structures, an attempt

has been made to solve the Euler-Lagrange equations in terms of Chadrasekhar-Kendall

eigenfunctions subject to the arcade geometry in cartesian coordinates with axisymmetry.

16

A solution is obtained for the two-dimensional case characterized by By = 0. One interesting

feature supported by this new relaxed state is the prediction of continuous transition from

the single arcades to multiple arcade type solutions with increase in the eigenvalue γ. A

particular case of interest is the observation of triple-arcade structures as the MDR relaxed

state. The importance of such structures can be realized from the recent LASCO observa-

tions on SOHO spacecraft that suggest the helmet streamers originating from the sun may

have an internal triple-arcade structure [33, 34]. Also a hypothetical picture of CME can be

postulated where the arcades transit from multiplets to singlets before the instability thresh-

old γ = 1 is achieved. This is consistent with the recent ﬁndings that the triple streamers are

more stable than the single ones [35]. In addition, the relaxed state predicts self-consistent

plasma ﬂow, which for the single-arcade solutions resembles the evershed type.

The above ﬁndings deﬁnitely points out that the MDR relaxed states applied to astro-

physical plasmas is a worthy case for further investigations. Any such investigation should

involve all the three components of the magnetic ﬁeld. Only then it will be possible to study

the eﬀects of twist on the ﬁeld lines. In principle, this should generate knots and further

studies can be made on the predictability of S-shaped solar prominences.

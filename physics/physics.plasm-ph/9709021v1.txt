Dielectric function of a two-component plasma including collisions

(December 19, 2013)

A multiple-moment approach to the dielectric function of a dense non-ideal plasma is treated
beyond RPA including collisions in Born approximation. The results are compared with the pertur-
bation expansion of the Kubo formula. Sum rules as well as Ward identities are considered. The
relations to optical properties as well as to the dc electrical conductivity are pointed out.

I. INTRODUCTION

The dielectric function ǫ(~k, ω) is a physical quantity containing a lot of information about the plasma. In homo-
geneous, isotropic systems it is related to the electrical conductivity σ(k, ω) and the polarisation function Π(k, ω)
according to

ǫ(k, ω) = 1 +

A well established expression is the random phase approximation (RPA) valid for collisionless plasmas. The inclusion
of collisions, however, is connected with diﬃculties. A perturbative treatment of the Kubo formula is not applicable
near ~k = 0, ω = 0 because there is an essential singularity in zeroth order. Partial summations are sometimes
in conﬂict with sum rules. Improvements of the RPA result are discussed in the static limit, where the local ﬁeld
corrections are treated in time-dependent mean-ﬁeld theory [1]. Also approximations based on the sum rules for the
lowest moments have been proposed [2]. However, an unambigous expression for ǫ(~k, ω) in the entire ~k ω space cannot
be given by these approaches.

A particular problem is the appropriate treatment of the long-wavelength limit k

0 at small frequencies where
the dc conductivity should be obtained. In a previous paper [3] an approach has been given where this limiting case
coincides with the Chapman-Enskog approach [4] to the dc conductivity. In particular, the polarization function was
found as

The matrix elements Mmn are equilibrium correlation function which are explicitly given in the following section.
They contain operators Bm and Bn which specify the nonequilibrium state.

For the evaluation of the dielectric function, we have to deal with two problems:
i) the choice of the operators Bn to describe the relevant ﬂuctuations in the linear response regime,
ii) the evaluation of the equilibrium correlation functions.
The equilibrium correlation functions in a nonideal plasma can be evaluated using the method of thermodynamic
Green functions. In lowest order of the perturbation theory to be considered here we have the Born approximation
as described in [3]. Higher order terms can be taken into account in a systematic way, see [5].

With respect to the choice of the operators Bn, only the current density operator J has been considered in [3]. In the
spirit of the Chapman-Enskog approach we will include here higher moments of the single-particle distribution function
to study the convergency behavior. For the dc conductivity the answer is well known see [6]. Note that diﬀerent
approaches based on diﬀerent sets of relevant observables Bn are formally equivalent as long as no approximations in
evaluating the correlation functions are performed. However, within a ﬁnite order perturbation theory, the results for
the conductivity are improved if the set of relevant observables is extended.

Results for the dielectric function within a four-moment approach are shown in Sec. II and compared with the
III. Of particular interest is the

results of a single-moment approach. Some exact relations are discussed in Sec.
relation to the Kubo formula which may be treated in perturbation theory as discussed in Sec. IV.

II. FOUR-MOMENT APPROACH FOR A TWO-COMPONENT PLASMA

are given by

We will consider a two-component plasma consisting of electrons (c = e) and ions (c = i). In particular, results are

Furthermore we used the abbreviation ˆJk = ǫ−1(k, ω) Jk .

To select the relevant operators Bn, we restrict us to the ordinary kinetic approach. The inclusion of higher order

correlations is also possible, see [5].

Within the kinetic approach, the nonequilibrium state of the plasma is described by the mean values of th single-
particle operators (5) corresponding to an induced single-particle distribution function with wave number k. Instead
of treating an inﬁnit number of operators depending on the momentum p, we can restrict us to a ﬁnite number of
moments of the distribution function. This procedure is familiar from the theory of the dc conductivity. Whereas in
that case only moments with respect to p have to be selected, in the general case of arbitrary k to be considered here
moments of p as well as ~p

~k have to be taken into account.

In this paper we investigate how the lowest moment approach in Born approximation is modiﬁed if further moments
are included. From the theory of dc conductivity we know that important modiﬁcations are obtained by including
the energy current density in addition to the particle current density, i. e. if we include also ~p2pz. Then, the electrical
cunductivity is not only described by the electron-ion interaction, but includes also the eﬀects of electron-electron
interaction which are not eﬀective in the lowest moment approximation due to the conservation of total momentum.
The four-moment approach to be considered in this paper is given by the following moments of the electron (c = e)

The evaluation of the corresponding correlation functions in Born approximation is given in the Appendix for the
nondegenerate case. As a trivial result, in the lowest approximation with respect to the interaction the RPA result
is recovered. In general the matrix elements are given in terms of integrals of expressions containing the Dawson
integral.

To give an example, a hydrogen plasma is considered with parameter values T = 98 Ryd and ne = 8.9 a

that the static limit is given by the Debye law.

Results for the inverse dielectric function, which describes the response to the external potential, are shown in

ﬁgures 3 (k = 0.5 a
B ) and compared with the RPA inverse dielectric function. Major deviations
occur only at frequencies close to the plasma frequency. For small momenta, the imaginary part of the dielectric
function including collisions is considerably broader compared with the RPA one. While the imaginary part of the
inverse dielectric function in the RPA approximation becomes delta-like in the long wavelength limit, a broadening of
the plasmon peak appears, as can be seen from ﬁgure 4. Some properties of the dielectric function will be discussed
in the following section.

Furthermore, the Kramers-Kronig relation holds which connects the real and the imaginary part of the dielectric
function:

Here, P denotes the Cauchy principal value integration. The inverse dielectric function obeys a corresponding relation.
Combining the Kramers-Kronig relation with the sum rules results in rigorous statements about the asymptotic
behaviour at high frequencies:

We test the two-moment approach by checking the sum rules as well as the asymptotic behaviour. It is found

As shown in ﬁgure 5, there is no shift of the maximum of the inverse dielectric function, while the plasmon peak is
broadened. Moreover, the long wavelength limit can be described by a Drude-like formula, implying that the width
of the plasmon peak is given by the dc conductivity. The form of the plasmon peak can be compared with computer
simulation studies. In contrast to RPA calculations, width as well as height of the plasmon peak in our calculation
are of comparable size as computer simulations [12].

IV. COMPARISON WITH THE KUBO FORMULA

Depending on the selected set of relevant operators

, diﬀerent expressions for the dielectric function can be

derived within linear response theory. A often used expression is the Kubo formula [13] as given by

Bn}

{

Π(k, ω) =

ik2βΩ0

Jk; ˆJkiω+iη .
h

As shown in [3], this result follows as a special case within the generalized linear response theory. As also shown
there, the diﬀerent expressions identical in the limit η

0 if no further approximations are performed.

The advantage of linear response theory is that the evaluation of the dielectric function is related to the evaluation
of equilibrium correlation functions. In dense, strongly coupled systems, these correlation functions can be calculated
with computer simulations. Another possibility is to use peturbation theory which is most eﬀectively formulated with
the concept of thermodynamic Green functions [14].

In zeroth order with respect to the interaction, from (17) immediately the RPA result is obtained, in coincidence
with all other approaches including J within the set of relevant operators. The ﬁrst order expansion with respect to
the screened interaction reads

what gives the frequency-dependent conductivity.

However, this perturbation expansion does not converge at ω

0, and partial summations have to be performed.
For instance, a simple approximation for the polarization function including interactions with further particles would
be a polarization function given by the product of two full propagators. This way, the polarization function contains
shifts and damping of the single-particle states due to the interaction with the medium. However, this approximation
does not fulﬁll rigorous relations such as sum rules, since important corrections to the RPA of the same order in the
density as the considered ones are missing, e.g. vertex corrections. These corrections are linked to the self-energy by
Ward identities [15]. As a consequence, the vertex has to be improved in accordance with the self-energy. Following
Baym and Kadanoﬀ [16], a consistent vertex can be constructed to a given self-energy. However, the solution of the
vertex equation cannot be given in a simple algebraic form, and usually some approximations are performed, see [17].

V. CONCLUSIONS

An approach to the dielectric function has been investigated which includes the eﬀects of collissions and can be used
in the entire k, ω space. Within a four-moment approach to a two-component plasma, the Born approximation has
been evaluated, and important rigorous results for the dielectric function are checked. Compared with the ordinary
Kubo formula, the approach given here seems to be more appropriate for perturbation expansions.

In particular, comparing with a one-moment approach, the convergency behavior of this method was inspected. As
well known from the theory of dc conductivity, convergence is expected if higher moments are included. In a more
general approch, also two-particle correlations can be included into the set of relevant operators.

Within a quantum statistical approach, the Born approximation can be improved by systematic treatment of Green
functions. This concerns, e.g., the inclusion of strong collision by treating T-matrices, degeneracy eﬀects, and the
treatment of the dynamic screening of the interaction. Here, the comparison with computer simulations is also an
interesting perspective. Work in this direction is in progress.

Abstract
The resonant interaction between kinetic Alfv´en and ion-acoustic waves is considered using the Hall-MHD
theory. The results of previous authors are generalized to cover both ﬁnite Larmor radius as well as the
ideal MHD results. It is found that the three wave coupling is strongest when the wavelength is comparable
to the ion-sound gyroradius. Applications of our work to weak turbulence theories as well as to the heating
of the solar corona are pointed out.

The nonlinear interaction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves has been considered by numer-
ous authors (see for example, Sagdeev and Galeev, 1969; Petviashvili and Pokhotelov, 1992; Shukla
and Stenﬂo, 1999). The applications involve fusion plasmas (Hasegawa and Uberoi, 1982), space
physics (Petviashvili and Pokhotelov, 1992; Shukla and Stenﬂo, 1999; Wu and Chao, 2004) as well as
solar physics (Shukla et al., 1999; Voitenko and Goossens, 2000 and 2002; Shukla and Stenﬂo, 2005;
Chandran 2005) and astrophysics (Ng and Bhattacharjee, 1996; Goldreich and Sridhar, 1997). The
classic work on three wave interaction of ideal MHD waves (Sagdeev and Galeev, 1969) was later
generalized to account for arbitrary (but still ideal) MHD wave modes and directions of propaga-
tions (Brodin and Stenﬂo, 1988). The ideal MHD processes were soon suggested to have applications
for the heating of fusion plasmas (Lashmore-Davies and Ong, 1974). Hasegawa and Chen (1976a)
showed, however, that processes involving kinetic Alfv´en waves were more eﬃcient for that purpose.
The latter waves can be described by the Hall-MHD theory, and general three wave coupling coef-
ﬁcients for the Hall-MHD plasmas were thus deduced by Brodin and Stenﬂo (1990). Applications
for the parametric decay instability of magneto-acoustic waves into two kinetic Alfv´en waves, to the
heating of the solar corona, were considered by Voitenko and Goossens (2002). The Joule electron
heating caused by high-frequency dispersive Alfv´en waves in the solar corona was also analysed by
Shukla et al. (1999).

Much of the previous work describing parametric instabilities involving kinetic Alfv´en waves
(KAWs) has adopted a kinetic theory (Hasegawa and Chen, 1976; Voitenko 1998) or multi-ﬂuid
models (Erokhin, Moiseev and Mukhin, 1978; Voitenko and Goossens, 2002). In the present paper,
we will however demonstrate that the essential characteristics of the three-wave decay interaction in-
volving the KAWs can be more simply described within a uniﬁed formalism of the Hall-MHD theory.
An important result of that formalism is that the decay of kinetic Alfv´en waves is dominated by the
excitation of modes with short perpendicular wavelengths, of the order of the ion-sound gyroradius,
that must be described by the Hall-MHD theory. We shall show that this speciﬁc example has general
signiﬁcance, and that the ideal MHD typically is unable to deal with the nonlinear evolution of the
MHD waves, even if the initial conditions are within the range of the ideal MHD.

Thus, we start with the Hall-MHD equations, that can be written as

and

= ∇ × (v × B − mi
e
where d/dt = ∂/∂t + v · ∇ , e and mi is the ion charge and mass, whereas ρ, v, and B are the
density, velocity and magnetic ﬁeld, respectively, and cs = [(Te + Ti) /mi]1/2 is the ion-sound speed.
Here Te and Ti are the electron and ion temperatures.

Here vgj is the group velocity of wave j, ωci is the ion gyrofrequency, and cA = (B0/µ0ρ0)1/2 is
the Alfv´en speed. The derivation of (6) and (7) is straightforward (Brodin and Stenﬂo, 1990). Our
result has the signiﬁcant advantage that the same coupling coeﬃcient C appears in both (6) and
(7). This means that the Manley-Rowe relations are always satisﬁed. We could alternatively have
used, instead of ρj, longitudinal and/or transverse components of the velocity (using the relation
vj = ρjKjωj/k2
j⊥ρ0), where the transverse velocity component is particularly convenient for Alfv´en
waves with small or vanishing density perturbations.

Next, considering two waves (with index 1 and 3) to be kinetic Alfv´en waves described by (12),

where v1,3 is the magnitude of the velocity of waves 1 and 3, respectively, and θ is the angle between
k1⊥ and k3⊥ (or the angle between v1 and v3 when k1,3⊥ → 0). The ﬁrst two terms in (18) dominate
for k2
ci, and agree with the ideal MHD coupling coeﬃcient of Brodin and Stenﬂo (1988)
in the low-beta limit considered here. The third term, which dominates for large perpendicular
wavenumbers, agrees with the coupling coeﬃcient of Hasegawa and Chen (1976), which was derived
using a kinetic approach. As a speciﬁc example, we let wave 3 be a pump wave. To demonstrate
the importance of the second term in (18), we assume that all waves have large perpendicular
wavenumbers, such that k2
∼ 1. Furthermore, to facilitate an order of magnitude estimate of
(18) we let k1⊥ and k3⊥ be approximately perpendicular to each other. In this case, the magnitude
of the third part of CAmA can be estimated as

which is much larger than the ﬁrst two parts of CAmA accounted for by the ideal MHD, and which
do not exceed unity. As a consequence, the growth rate ΓHM into short perpendicular wavelength
modes (with k2
∼ 1, described by the Hall-MHD theory) is larger than the growth rate ΓIM
due to the ordinary ideal MHD modes by a factor ΓHM/ΓIM ∼ ωci/ω. Thus, the increased coupling
strength into short wavelength modes with perpendicular wavelengths of the order of the ion-sound
gyroradius (cs/ωci) aﬀects the parametric decay processes signiﬁcantly. This is very important as
the wave cascade processes (Goldreich and Sridhar, 1997) of weak turbulence theories are based on

the resonant three-wave coupling mechanism. Moreover, while the general features of such processes
lead to a broadening of the frequency spectrum, and energy transfer towards lower frequencies, we
note that the energy transfer will mainly occur in the direction of higher coupling strength, i.e.
into modes with short perpendicular wavelengths. Thus, even for an initial turbulent spectrum well
within the range of the ideal MHD, wave cascade processes will eventually lead to the excitation of
short perpendicular wavelengths and the necessity to use the Hall-MHD rather than the ideal MHD.
Assuming that wave 3 is a pump wave with magnetic ﬁeld magnitude B3, and using the estimate

It should, however, be pointed out that the present decay channel for a KAW into an ion-acoustic
wave and another KAW is not unique. Other decay channels that have been investigated for KAWs
can compete with it (e.g. Voitenko and Goossens 2000; Onishchenko et. al. 2004). These pro-
cesses can spread out the KAW spectrum and thus prevent the parametric decay into ion-acoustic
waves. To ﬁnd out the relative importance of the decay into ion-acoustic waves as compared to
the above mentioned processes, we should therefore compare our estimate (20) with the growth
rates ΓAA of Voitenko and Goossens (2000), and ΓJGR of Onishchenko et al. (2004). We then use
the estimates ΓAA ∼ 0.2ω3k2
/ωci is the ion Larmor radius, and
ΓJGR ∼ 2ω3Dk2
0, where D is a factor of order unity (Onishchenko et al., 2004). Onishchenko
et al. (2004) showed that ΓJGR is smaller than ΓAA if B3/B0 is smaller than a factor of the order k3zρi.
A comparison between ΓHM of the present paper and ΓAA reveals that ΓHM/ΓAA ∼ 5ωcik3z/ω3k2
3ρi.
Although the estimates above are very crude, they show that the process we consider in the present
paper can be even more important than those of previous papers for a signiﬁcant range of parameters.
To summarize, we have reconsidered the interaction of kinetic Alfv´en and ion-acoustic waves
using the Hall-MHD theory. In particular, the three wave equations involving the nonlinear coupling
between two kinetic Alfv´en waves and one ion-acoustic wave have been explicitly presented. The same
coupling coeﬃcient (18) appears in all these equations, implying that the Manley-Rowe relations are
fulﬁlled. Furthermore, our coupling coeﬃcient (18) includes both the ideal MHD results of Brodin
and Stenﬂo (1988), and the eﬀects due to the kinetic approach of Hasegawa and Chen (1976a), in
a uniﬁed formalism. As can be seen from (18), the wave coupling is strongest for perpendicular
wavelengths of the order of the ion-sound gyroradius. As has been argued above, this has important
consequences for several processes, such as for the parametric decay instabilities and wave cascades
in weak turbulence theories. Moreover, the formalism presented above is relevant for plasma particle
energization in the solar corona by kinetic Alfv´en waves. In the solar corona, a kinetic Alfv´en pump
wave can be excited by a linear transformation of an Alfv´en surface wave in the neighbourhood of the
resonance region (Hasegawa and Chen, 1976b). The mode converted kinetic Alfv´en wave can then
further decay into a daughter kinetic Alfv´en wave and a dispersive ion sound wave, as described here.
The nonlinearly excited kinetic Alfv´en waves can attain large amplitudes and small perpendicular
wavelengths (Hasegawa and Chen, 1976b), and they could therefore be our most eﬃcient agents for
energization of ions and electrons by kinetic Alfv´en wave phase mixing and Joule heating (Ionson,
1978; Hasegawa and Uberoi, 1982; Shukla et al., 1994; Cramer, 2001), as well as for turbulent heating
and particle-KAW interactions.

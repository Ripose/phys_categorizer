Spontaneous branching of discharge channels is frequently observed, but not well understood. We
recently proposed a new branching mechanism based on simulations of a simple continuous discharge
model in high ﬁelds. We here present analytical results for such streamers in the Lozansky-Firsov
limit where they can be modelled as moving equipotential ionization fronts. This model can be
analyzed by conformal mapping techniques which allow the reduction of the dynamical problem to
ﬁnite sets of nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations. The solutions illustrate that branching is
generic for the intricate head dynamics of streamers in the Lozansky-Firsov-limit.

When non-ionized matter is suddenly exposed to
strong ﬁelds, ionized regions can grow in the form of
streamers. These are ionized and electrically screened
channels with rapidly propagating tips. The tip region is
a very active impact ionization region due to the self-
generated local ﬁeld enhancement. Streamers appear
in early stages of atmospheric discharges like sparks or
sprite discharges [1,2], they also play a prominent role in
numerous technical processes. It is commonly observed
that streamers branch spontaneously [3,4]. But how this
branching is precisely determined by the underlying dis-
charge physics, is essentially not known. In recent work
[5,6], we have suggested a branching mechanism from ﬁrst
principles. This work drew some attention [7,8], since
the proposed mechanism yields quantitative predictions
for speciﬁc parameters, and since it is qualitatively dif-
ferent from the older branching concept of the “dielectric
breakdown model” [9–11]. This older concept actually
can be traced back to concepts of rare long-ranged (and
hence stochastic) photo-ionization events probably ﬁrst
suggested in 1939 by Raether [12]. Therefore, it came as
a surprise that we predicted streamer branching in a fully
deterministic model with pure impact ionization. Since
our evidence for the phenomenon was mainly from nu-
merical solutions together with a physical interpretation,
the accuracy of our numerical scheme was challenged
[13,14]. Furthermore, some authors have argued previ-
ously [15,16] that a deterministic discharge model like
ours could never create branching streamers since a con-
vex head shape could not become concave.

Therefore in the present paper, we investigate the is-
sue by analytical means. We show that essential fea-
tures of our numerical solutions are generic for stream-
ers in the Lozansky-Firsov limit [5,6,17]. In particular,
we show that the streamer head can become ﬂatter and
evolve from convex to concave shape. We deﬁne the
Lozansky-Firsov-limit as the stage of evolution where the
streamer head is almost equipotential and surrounded by
a thin electrostatic screening layer. While in the origi-
nal article [17], only simple steady state solutions with
parabolic head shape are discussed, we will show here
that a streamer in the Lozansky-Firsov limit actually can

exhibit a very rich head dynamics that includes sponta-
neous branching. Furthermore, our analytical solutions
disprove the reasoning of [15] by explicit counterexam-
ples. Our analytical methods are adapted from two ﬂuid
ﬂow in Hele-Shaw cells [18–22]. But our explicit solutions
that amount to the evolution of “bubbles” in a dipole
ﬁeld [23], have not been reported in the hydrodynamics
literature either.

The relation between our previous numerical investi-
gations [5,6] and our present analytical model is laid in
two steps. First, numerical solutions show essentially the
same evolution in the purely two-dimensional case as in
the three-dimensional case with assumed cylinder geome-
try [5,6]. Because there is an elegant analytical approach,
we focus on the two-dimensional case. This has the ad-
ditional advantage that such two-dimensional solutions
rather directly apply to, e.g., discharges in Corbino discs
[24]. Second, we use the following simplifying approxi-
mations for a Lozansky-Firsov streamer: (i) the interior
of the streamer is electrically completely screened; hence
the electric potential ϕ is constant; hence the ionization
front coincides with an equipotential line, (ii) the width
of the screening layer around the ionized body is much
smaller than all other relevant length scales and in the
present study it is actually neglected, (iii) the velocity
of the ionization front v is determined by the local elec-
tric ﬁeld; in the simplest case to be investigated here,
it is simply taken to be proportional to the ﬁeld at the
boundary v = c ∇ϕ with some constant c (for the va-
lidity of the approximation, cf. [25,26]). Together with
∇2ϕ = 0 in the non-ionized outer region and with ﬁxed
limiting values of the potential ϕ far from the streamer,
this deﬁnes a moving boundary problem for the interface
between ionized and non-ionized region. We assume the
ﬁeld far from the streamer to be constant as in our sim-
ulations [6]. Such a constant far ﬁeld can be mimicked
by placing the streamer between the two poles of an elec-
tric dipole where the distance between the poles is much
larger than the size of the streamer.

When the electric ﬁeld points into the x direction
and y parametrizes the transversal direction, our two-
dimensional Lozansky-Firsov streamer in free ﬂight in a

where ˆx is the unit vector in the x direction, and we
have chosen the gauge such that the potential inside the

total charge on the streamer vanishes; otherwise a con-
x2 + y2 has to be added on the r.h.s. of
tribution ∝ 1/
Eq. (2).

Essentially the same moving boundary problem arises
in Hele-Shaw ﬂow of two ﬂuids with a large viscosity con-
trast [18,19]: Lozansky-Firsov streamers and viscous ﬁn-
gers on the present level of description can be identiﬁed
immediately by equating the electric potential ϕ with
the ﬂuid pressure p [25,26]. To such problems, power-
ful conformal mapping methods [20–22] can be applied.
Most work with this method is concerned with viscous
ﬁngers in a channel geometry, i.e., with boundary con-
ditions on a lateral external boundary that cannot be
realized in an electric system. A few authors also study
air bubbles within a viscous ﬂuid, or viscous droplets in
air, mostly under the action of ﬂow ﬁelds generated by
one source or one sink of pressure, i.e., by monopoles.
On the other hand, the approximation (1)-(4) describes
streamers in free space between two electrodes as in [6].
With the asymptote (2), it is mathematically equivalent
to air bubbles in a dipole ﬁeld. This case has not been
studied in detail. It is known that any ellipse with the
main axes oriented parallel and perpendicular to the di-
rection of the dipole is a uniformly translating solution of
this problem [27]. The time dependent solutions of [28]
do not apply to streamers since the boundary condition
on the moving interface is diﬀerent. Refs. [23] and [29]
study how and when cusps in the interfaces of droplets
and bubbles emerge when these are driven by multipole
ﬁelds. But for bubbles in a dipole ﬁeld, again only the
steady state ellipse solutions are given [23].

In the present paper, we therefore apply conformal
mapping methods to the evolution of “bubbles” in a
dipole ﬁeld in a Hele-Shaw experiment and proceed be-
yond the steady state ellipse solutions. We identify the
general structure of time dependent solutions of (1)-(4).
The analytically derived solutions reproduce dynamics
observed in previous streamer simulations. Rather than
a pole decomposition [20], we derive a decomposition into
Fourier modes of the circle and calculate an equation for
the non-linear dynamical coupling of their amplitudes.

In detail, this is done in the following steps:

(i) The spatial coordinates are expressed by the complex
coordinate z = x + iy. According to standard complex
analysis, ﬁnding a real harmonic function ϕ(x, y) solving
the Laplace equation (1) in a given region is equivalent

to ﬁnding a complex function Φ(z) that is analytical in
the same region and has real part Re Φ(z) = ϕ(x, y).
(ii) A conformal map from the interior of the unit circle
to the exterior of the streamer or “bubble” is constructed.
Including the point at inﬁnity, the region outside the
streamer is simply connected and Riemann’s mapping
theorem applies; therefore the mapping exists. Since the
boundary moves, the mapping is time dependent; we de-
note it with z = ft(ω) where ω parametrizes the interior
of the unit circle. It can be written in the following form:

x + iy = z = ft(ω) =

ak(t) ωk.

(5)

∞

Xk=−1

Here the center of the unit disc has been mapped to the
point at ∞ by ft(0) = ∞. Taking furthermore a−1(t)
as a real positive number makes the mapping unique,
again according to Riemann’s mapping theorem. The
functional form of the expansion in (5) can be under-
stood by composing the complete map from a conformal
map ζ = ht(ω) that deforms the unit disc continuously,
followed by the inversion z = 1/ζ. Since ht(ω) is confor-
mal, it has a single zero which we choose to be at ω = 0.
For ω ≪ 1, the expansion ht(ω) ∝ ω + O(ω2) follows.
Therefore ft(ω) has a single pole ∝ ω−1 and is otherwise
analytical on the unit disc.
(iii) Now the potential ˆΦ(ω) on the unit disc can be cal-
culated explicitly. Since ft(ω) is a conformal mapping,
the function Φ(z) is analytical if and only if the function
ˆΦ(ω) = Φ(ft(ω)) is analytical. The asymptote of ˆΦ(ω)
for ω → 0 is determined by (2) and (5): for |x|, |z| → ∞,
we have ϕ(x, y) → −E0x, hence Φ(z) → −E0z, and
therefore with (5): ˆΦ(ω) → −E0a−1(t)/ω for ω → 0.
This means that the pole of ˆΦ(ω) at the origin of the
unit disc ω = 0 corresponds to the dipole of Φ(z) at
z → ±∞. This dipole generates the ﬁeld and the inter-
facial motion. In the remainder of the unit disc, there
are no sources or sinks of potential, hence ˆΦ is analytical
there. Furthermore, at the boundary of the streamer, we
have ϕ = 0 from (3) or Re Φ = 0, resp. The boundary of
the streamer maps onto the unit circle, so Re ˆΦ(ω) = 0
for |ω| = 1. Using the asymptotics at ω → 0 and an-
alyticity in the remaining region, the unique and exact
solution for the potential is

ˆΦ(ω) = E0a−1(t)

(iv) Now the velocity (4) determines the motion of the
interface. This interface is the time dependent map ft(ω)
of the unit circle ω = eiα parametrized by the angle
α ∈ [0, 2π). The velocity (4) determines the equation
of motion for the mapping function ft(ω). Following the

The problem (1)-(4) is symmetric under reﬂection on
the x-axis. We limit our investigation to solutions with
the same mirror symmetry under y ↔ −y. This implies
that all ak(t) have to be real. The position (x, y)(α, t) of
the point of the interface labelled by the angle α at time
t can be read directly from (5) by inserting ω = eiα:

Eqs. (10) and (11) identify large classes of analytical
solutions with arbitrary ﬁxed N . These solutions reduce
the dynamical moving boundary problem in two spatial
dimensions of Eqs. (1)–(4) exactly to a ﬁnite set of ordi-
nary diﬀerential equations for the nonlinear coupling of
the amplitudes ak(t) of modes eikα, 0 ≤ α < 2π. These
equations are easy to integrate numerically or for small
N even analytically. We will use this form to discuss now
generic solutions of Eqs. (1)–(4) as the simplest approx-
imation of a streamer in the Lozansky-Firsov limit.

First, it is now easy to reproduce the uniformly pro-
pagating ellipse solutions of [23,27] as the solutions with

N = 1: for |a1| 6= |a−1|, the equations reduce to ∂ta−1 =
0 = ∂ta1 and ∂ta0 = 2E0c a−1/(a1 − a−1). These so-
lutions correspond to ellipses whose principal radii are
oriented along the axes. These radii maintain their val-
ues rx,y = a−1 ± a1 (assuming a−1 > a1 > 0) and move
with constant velocity vellipse = −E0c (rx + ry)/ry. The
Lozansky-Firsov-parabola can be understood as limit
cases of such uniformly propagating ellipses.

In contrast to N ≤ 1, all solutions with N ≥ 2 have
nontrivial dynamics. It can be tracked by integrating the
N +2 ordinary diﬀerential equations (11) numerically and
then plotting the boundaries (10) at consecutive times.
Examples of such dynamics are shown in the ﬁgures.

Fig. 1 shows four cases of the upward motion of a con-
ically shaped streamer in equal time steps. The initial
conditions are almost identical. On the leftmost ﬁgure,
an ellipse is corrected only by a mode e2iα to create the
conical shape. This shape with N = 2 eventually de-
velops a concave tip, but only after much longer times
than shown in the ﬁgure. In the other ﬁgures this coni-
cal shape is perturbed initially by a minor perturbation
with wavenumber 8 or 30, corresponding to N = 8 and
30 in (10) and (11). The amplitude of the perturbation
is chosen such that a cusp develops at time 0.1/(E0c).
Depending on the sign of the amplitude, the cusp devel-
ops on or oﬀ axis. Note that our reduction of the mov-
ing boundary problem to the set of ordinary diﬀerential
equations (11) assures that the evolving shape is a true

solution of the problem (1)–(4). Figs. 1b and 1d demon-
strate that spontaneous branching is a possible solution.

FIG. 2. Evolution of the tip of an elongated “streamer” in
equal time steps up to time t = 0.1/(E0c); initial condition
z(α, 0) = e−iα + 0.9 · eiα − 0.03 · e2iα − 1.2 · 10−5 · e12iα.

In Fig. 2 the ionized body is longer stretched and only
the tip is shown, again at 6 equidistant time steps. The
streamer becomes slower when the head becomes ﬂatter,
since the electric ﬁeld diminishes at the head together
with the local curvature. Eventually, the head becomes
concave and “branches”.

In summary, the solutions of the moving boundary
problem (1)–(4) demonstrate the onset of branching
within a purely deterministic model. They show a high
sensitivity to minor deviations of the initial conditions.
A streamer in the Lozansky-Firsov-limit is therefore also
very sensitive to physical perturbations during the evo-
lution, and simulations in this limit are just as sensi-
tive to small numerical errors. But we have shown that
perturbations during the evolution are not necessary for
branching.

Our analysis applies to streamers in the Lozansky-
Firsov-limit, i.e., to almost equipotential streamers that
are surrounded by a very thin electrical screening layer.
This limit is approached in our previous simulations [5,6].
These results raise the following questions that are
presently under investigation: 1) When does a streamer
reach this Lozansky-Firsov-limit that then generically
leads to branching? 2) The formation of cusps should
be suppressed by some microscopic stabilization mech-

anism.
suﬃcient to supply this mechanism? 3) If this stabiliza-
tion is taken into account, can an interfacial model re-
produce numerical and physical streamer branching be-
yond the ﬁrst splitting that is the subject of the present
paper? 4) How can the motion of the back end of the
streamer be modelled appropriately (rather than assum-
ing the velocity law v ∝ ∇ϕ (4) everywhere)? How can
it be incorporated into the present analysis?

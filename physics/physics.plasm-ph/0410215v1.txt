Abstract. The neoclassical transport theory is applied to calculate electron cyclotron
current drive (ECCD) eﬃciency in an axisymmetric tokamak in the low-collisionality
regime. The tokamak ordering is used to obtain a system of equations that describe the
dynamics of the plasma where the nonlinear ponderomotive (PM) force due to high-
power RF waves is included. The PM force is produced around an electron cyclotron
resonant surface at a speciﬁc poloidal location. The ECCD eﬃciency is analyzed in the
cases of ﬁrst and second harmonics (for diﬀerent impinging angles of the RF waves) and
it is validated using experimental parameter values from TCV and T-10 tokamaks. The
results are in agreement with those obtained by means of Green’s function techniques.

Electron cyclotron current drive eﬃciency

1. Introduction

Electron cyclotron waves can eﬃciently drive a localized non-inductive current in
toroidal devices for a number of applications. The main of these are found in the
neoclassical tearing mode control [1], the fully non-inductive current drive in tokamaks
[2, 3] and the bootstrap current compensation in stellerators [4]. ECCD results from the
sensitive heating of electrons travelling in one direction in order to decrease their collision
frequency, and thus enhance their contribution to the toroidal current, compared to their
unheated counterparts moving in the opposite direction [5]. For an oﬀ-axis current drive,
this current drive mechanism is oﬀset by the mirror trapping of electrons in toroidal
geometries that drives current in the reverse direction [6]. The ECCD eﬃciency is usually
calculated through a bounce-averaged quasilinear Fokker-Planck treatment [7, 8].

Electron cyclotron (EC) waves have recently attracted a great interest. Such
waves exhibit the very important property of being able to be excited at a localized
particular magnetic surface. This mechanism considers the introduction of EC waves
ωBe) /kz
at a minimum of the magnetic ﬁeld, where the resonance condition υzr = (ω
holds. Many tokamak experiments have reported that the ECCD eﬃciency decreases as
the power deposition location is moved away from the plasma center, either by varying
the magnetic ﬁeld strength [9] or by changing the poloidal steering of the ECCD launcher
[10].

−

In the low power limit, the ECCD can be calculated from the relativistic, linearized
Fokker-Planck equation using ray tracing codes [11]. If the eﬀects of the radiofrequency
(RF) quasilinear diﬀusion and the parallel electric ﬁeld are included, the bounce-
averaged, quasilinear Fokker-Planck codes can be used [12]. However, the nonlinearities
associated to high power eﬀects are not considered. In the present paper we analyze the
ECCD eﬃciency in an axisymmetric tokamak, in the low collisionallity regime within
the neoclassical transport theory. The ECCD is calculated including a ponderomotive
. The tokamak ordering is used to obtain a system of equations that describe
force
the dynamics of the plasma where the nonlinear ponderomotive (PM) force due to high-
power RF waves is included. The PM force is produced around an electron cyclotron
resonant surface at a speciﬁc poloidal location. The ECCD eﬃciency is analyzed in
the cases of the ﬁrst and second harmonics (for diﬀerent impinging angles of the RF
waves) and it is validated using experimental parameter values from TCV and T-10
tokamaks. The results obtained are in agreement with those delivered by the linearized
Fokker-Planck equation.

2. Basic equations.

Let us assume a plasma which contains only charged and neutral particles in a toroidal
axysimmetric magnetic ﬁeld. The hydrodynamic description of the plasma is taken in
the neoclassical ﬂuid approximation. In this approach, the continuity equation for the

with respect to time. In this work, we chose the following expression of the time averaged
ponderomotive force [14]

Given the Ohm’s law, we assume the conductivity tensor σjk, which depends on
the assumed characteristic frequency. The ponderomotive force is introduced thanks to
a system of orthogonal coordinates (e1, e2, e3) with the components of the conductivity
tensor in the form

6. Analysis of results.

In order to examine the expression for the current density (31) associated with the
ponderomotive force, we adopt the criteria that the deposited energy by the RF wave
has to be bigger that the internal enegy (E2 > NT ) so to include the nonlinear eﬀects.
This condition is satisﬁed on Tokamaks TCV ad T-10, where an analysis reported in
[15, 16] shows that E2
1013 >
NT = 54500.5 in these tokamaks, respectively. Such results indicate that the eﬀect of
the nonlinear ponderomotive force is highly important in determining the energy density
introduced by the RF wave. We will consider a ﬂux cylinder with a radius equal to the
Larmor radius so to calculate this energy.

The corresponding data for the TCV and T-10 Tokamaks are summarized in Table 1
and Table 2 [15, 16], respectively. In both reports, the ﬁrst and second harmonics of
the EC waves were used provided that the introduction of the RF wave took place at
the high magnetic ﬁeld (HF) side.

The power associated to the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld follows from

It is important to notice that the current density is highly unstable and it depends

the current density stabilizes and, furthermore, its values reproduce those experimental
ones reported in [15, 16], as can be observed in ﬁgure 1 and ﬁgure 3.

From ﬁgure 2 and ﬁgure 4, we observe a process in which the Fish and Ohkawa
mechanisms weaken each other, as reported in [7]. The general behavior is in good
agreement with that described in [8, 18], considering that their calculation was obtained
from the linearized Fokker-Planck equation.

Here, the density proﬁle has been modelled as a parabolic one in order to analyze

the current, ne = n0e

It can be noticed in ﬁgure 5 that, to ﬁrst order terms in the parameter ǫ, the driven

current density increases with the radius.

7. Conclusions.

The development of a driven current density expression that takes into account the
ponderomotive force created by EC waves, has required the use of the neoclassical
transport equations up to ﬁrst order terms with respect to the parameter ε = ρ/L at a
steady state.

The driven current density has been initially obtained in a system of toroidal ﬂux
coordinates. That description of the current density is transformed in terms of the
Hamada coordinates [19] which is necessary for its validation with experimental results.
Thus, the expression for the ponderomotive force reported in [14], is written in a local
system of orthogonal coordinates (e1, e2, e3), where e3 is parallel to the toroidal magnetic
ﬁeld.

The driven current density generated by an extraordinary wave at the cyclotron
resonance of electrons, is analyzed as a function of the Ω2/ω2 ratio. This is accomplished
by using the parameters of the TCV and T-10 Tokamaks at the ﬁrst and second
harmonics, assuming that the introduction of the wave takes place at the HF side.
From this results, we have obtained an interval of frequencies, in agreement with the
experiments, where the current shows a stable behavior.

In the particular case of a parabolic proﬁle, it has been shown that the ECCD
increases with the radius, at ﬁrst approximation. Finally, it is important to notice that,
according to [17], the eﬃciency is higher for the second harmonic as it is shown in
ﬁgure 5.

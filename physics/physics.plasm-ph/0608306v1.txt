Abstract

Parametric instabilities of parallel propagating, circularly polarized Alfv´en waves in a uniform

background plasma is studied, within a framework of one-dimensional Vlasov equation for ions

and massless electron ﬂuid, so that kinetic perturbations in the longitudinal direction (ion Landau

damping) are included. The present formulation also includes the Hall eﬀect. The obtained results

agree well with relevant analysis in the past, suggesting that kinetic eﬀects in the longitudinal

direction play essential roles in the parametric instabilities of Alfv´en waves when the kinetic eﬀects

react “passively”. Furthermore, existence of the kinetic parametric instabilities is conﬁrmed for the

regime with small wave number daughter waves. Growth rates of these instabilities are sensitive

to ion temperature. (submitted to Phys. Plasmas)

Alfv´en waves are ubiquitous in collisionless space plasmas, for example in solar corona,

solar wind, and foreshock region of planetary bowshocks. Dissipation of the Alfv´en waves

is important in heating of background plasma, generating various structures.

It is also

important in loading of momentum, energy, and helicity conveyed by the Alfv´en waves

since it is completed at the moment the waves damp away. Parametric instabilities are

of particular interest for dissipation of quasi-parallel Alfv´en waves in space, since they are

typically robust for linear ion-cyclotron damping (due to small wave frequencies) and for

linear Landau damping (due to small propagation angle relative to the background magnetic

ﬁeld).

Within a framework of the Hall-MHD, a number of research have been carried out on the

parametric instabilities of parallel propagating, circularly polarized Alfv´en waves. Growth

rates of the instabilities depend on the parent wave amplitude, wave number, polarization,

and the ratio of the sound to the Alfv´en velocity (= Cs/CA =

βf ).

Numerical analysis using the hybrid simulation code (super-particle ions + massless elec-

p

tron ﬂuid) was performed by Terasawa et. al.4 and Vasquez5. Mjolhus and Wyller6,7 derived

and discussed in detail a nonlinear evolution equation (kinetically modiﬁed derivative nonlin-

ear Schrodinger equation, ﬁrst derived by Rogister8), which describes the wave modulation

of weakly despersive, nonlinear Alfv´en waves including the ion Landau damping. Fla et.

al.9 and Spangler10,11 discussed the modulational instability of parallel propagating, circu-

larly polarized Alfv´en waves, and pointed out that, while the kinetic eﬀects suppressed the

parametric instabilities present in the ﬂuid model (“conservative modulational instability

(CMI)”), the ion kinetics could evoke a new instability (“resonant particle modulational

instability”)9. Inhester12 ﬁrst showed the kinetic formulation for parametric decay insta-

bilities without dispersion. Gomberoﬀ13 and Araneda14 discussed the ion kinetic eﬀects on

parametric instabilities phenomenologically. Common view among past analytical works on

parametric instabilities is that the ion kinetic eﬀects expand the unstable parameter regime

and reduce the maximum growth rate. Recently, Passot and Sulem15 derived the dispersive

Landau ﬂuid model, and made comparison with some of the other models in the past from

both analytical and numerical standpoints15,16.

To our knowledge, linear kinetic analysis with dispersion has not yet been demonstrated.

Our aim in this study is to derive a kinetic formulation including dispersion, and present

a linear analysis and compare it with other analytical results. Our treatment of the ion

2

kinetic eﬀects is similar to that in Munoz et. al.17, in which relativistic dispersion relation

for parametric instabilities in an electron-positron plasma is derived.

We consider the parametric instabilities of circularly polarized parallel propagating Alfv´en

waves, which are the exact solution within the Hall-MHD equation set. Assuming weak ion

cyclotron damping, we include the kinetic eﬀects only along the longitudinal (x) direction.

Let f (x, t, v) be the ion distribution function, and deﬁne the integrated longitudinal distri-

bution function,

Then the governing set of equations can be written as,

g(x, t, vx) =

f (x, t, v)dvydvz.

velocity vector, ˜b = by + ibz and ˜u = uy + iuz are the complex transverse magnetic ﬁeld and

bulk velocity, respectively, and ex is the longitudinal electric ﬁeld. All the normalizations

have been made using the background constant magnetic ﬁeld, density, Alfv´en velocity, and

the ion gyro-frequency deﬁned at a certain reference point.

The total pressure is given as p = pe + pi, where isothermal electrons are assumed, i.e.,

pe = Teρ. Also it is assumed that the ion and electron pressures are isotropic both at

the zeroth and at the perturbation orders. Usual beta ratio slightly diﬀers from the ratio

between the sound and the Alfv´en wave speed squared, βf = (γeβe + γiβi)/2, where γe = 1

and γi are the ratios of speciﬁc heats for electrons and ions, respectively.

At the zeroth order we consider the parallel propagating Alfv´en wave given as

By taking the cold limit (βi

0, i.e., ξ >> 1), the dispersion relation of the Alfv´en wave

parametric instabilities in the Hall-MHD is obtained4. We note that (17) is an odd function

∼

with respect to both Ω and K.

Now we examine the numerical solutions of (17). First, we refer to the results by

Inhester12, in which the kinetic dispersion relation of parametric decay instability is de-

rived without dispersion, using drift kinetic model. In order to make comparison with their

results, we omit the dispersion terms in (17): the third term in the r.h.s. of (18) and the

second term in the r.h.s. of (19). By further assuming the cold limit, our equation leads

to the MHD dispersion relation obtained by Goldstein18 and Derby19. On the other hand,

numerically obtained dispersion relations based on our model and that of Inhester at least

qualitatively agrees, in the sense that the ion kinetic eﬀects enlarges the unstable parameter

regime and also the maximum growth rates are reduced (Figure 1). These results are also

in qualitative agreement with some of the past works12,16.

We now turn our attention to the parametric instabilities of the dispersive Alfv´en waves.

Figure 2 shows the growth rates computed from (17) for right-hand polarized Alfv´en waves,

for various temperature ratios, Tr(= Ti/Te). The decay-like instabilities have positive growth

rates when K >

= 0.408. The results here qualitatively agrees with numerical results

obtained by Vasquez5 and Bugnon16 (Tabele 1 in both papers), which suggests that the

|

ion kinetic eﬀects in the longitudinal direction play essential roles in kinetic modiﬁcation

of the Alfv´en parametric instabilities, when βi is relatively small, i.e., the kinetic eﬀects

“passively” react to the ﬂuid dynamics. Figure 3 shows the growth rates under the same

parameters as in Figure 2 except that k0 = 0.102 and ω0 = 0.107 (R-mode). Both regimes

are plotted. The former corresponds to the “conservative decay

instability (CDI)”, which has the ﬁnite growth rate at Tr = 0 as we see in Figures 1 and 2.

On the other hand, the latter, the “resonant particle modulational instability (RPMI)”, is

destabilized only for ﬁnite Tr, although the growth rate is typically 1 or 2 orders less than

the CMI. The RPMI is quenched when Tr = 0, suggesting that the instability is a product

of Landau resonant eﬀects (Fla et. al.9, Spangler1011). The RPMI exists regardless of the

inclusion of the Hall-eﬀect.

As shown in Figure 3 (c)-(g), the growth rate of the RPMI is sensitive to βi. In particular,

as βi is increased, the growth rate of the RPMI is enhanced while that of the CDI is reduced.

When βi = 2 and βe = 0.225, the growth rates of both instabilities become comparable. The

CDI growth rate is increased as βf (=βe/2 for the present case) is reduced. The decrease of

the growth rates of the CD(M)I is relaxed at large Tr (c.f., Fig.1, 2 (e), (f)).

Finally, we discuss brieﬂy the instability of left-hand polarized Alfv´en waves (Figure 4).

Under the parameters used, the CMI (the maximum growth rate

0.4), the CDI (

0.6),

and the beat instability (

0.8) are driven unstable at Tr = 0. Figure 4 shows that the growth

rate of the decay-like instability (

0.8) exceeds that of the modulational-like instability at

In the present paper we discussed the kinetically modiﬁed parametric instabilities of cir-

cularly polarized, parallel-propagating Alfv´en waves within a framework of one-dimensional

system, which includes longitudinal kinetic perturbations. The obtained dispersion relation

(17) is numerically evaluated, and compared with relevant works in the literature.

While our analysis includes βi as a free parameter, it should be retained at a modest

value, since at high βi, kinetic response of the transverse distribution function cannot be

neglected, and the kinetic eﬀects must be fully included in the parent wave dispersion relation

(9)5,16,20,21. Comparison of Fig.2 with past studies suggests that our assumption on basic

equations is valid when βi = 0.45, but is not for βi

> 1.55. This remark also applies

∼

to simulation studies using the hybrid code: it is important to use kinetic instead of ﬂuid

dispersion relation to give initial wave when the ion beta is large.

Parametric instabilities are believed to play essential roles in space plasma, for example, in

the solar wind where β typically varies around unity22, or in the earth’s foreshock where the

backstreaming ions from the bowshock23 generate large amplitude Alfv´en waves24 25. Never-

theless, the instabilities have not yet been clearly demonstrated by spacecraft experiments.

We hope the situation to change via knowledge of kinetic modiﬁcation of the instabilities as

well as state-of-the-art data acquisition and analysis techniques.

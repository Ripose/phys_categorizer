Abstract

We study the rotational and translational kinetics of massive particulates (dust grains) ab-

sorbing the ambient gas. Equations for microscopic phase densities are deduced resulting in the

Fokker-Planck equation for the dust component. It is shown that although there is no stationary

distribution, the translational and rotational temperatures of dust tend to certain values, which

diﬀer from the temperature of the ambient gas. The inﬂuence of the inner structure of grains on

rotational kinetics is also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Recently there was growing interest to the investigation of composite media, called dusty

plasmas, consisting of aerosol particles in a gas discharge. Besides numerous industrial

applications dusty plasmas provide ample opportunities to studying in situ phase transitions

in the dust component, intergrain interactions, grain charging etc.

One of the peculiar features of dusty plasmas is that the average kinetic energy of the

dust component, i.e., its translational temperature, may be considerably higher than the

temperature of the ambient plasma. In details the problem was studied in the recent papers

by Quinn and Goree [1, 2], where in parallel with the experiments a model of the Brownian

motion explaining anomalous kinetic temperature was developed.

The kinetic description of dusty plasma was discussed in numerous theoretical studies

[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Generally, there are two ways plasma particles interact with dust grains:

ﬁrst, the scattering of a particle by grain electric ﬁeld and, second, the direct impact of a

particle on a grain surface. The latter process results in grain charging due to the higher

mobility of electrons, it may change grain mass, heat its surface etc. In other words, as it is

well-understood nowadays, the adequate statistical description of the dust component should

take into account inner degrees of freedom, the most important among which is the grain

charge. Kinetic consideration of charging process shows that absorption of small plasma

particles by grains can result in inequality of the grain temperature and the temperatures

of the light components even for the case of equal temperatures of electrons and ions[3, 4].

To avoid confusion it should be noted that since the system is open there is no conﬂict of

the latter result with thermodynamics.

Under the conditions of experiments on ﬁne grain synthesis [10, 11] or etching [12] grain

mass should also be treated as a dynamic variable [13, 14, 15]. Thermophoretic [16] and

radiometric [17] forces provided by inhomogeneous heating of the grain surface may also

play an important role, under microgravity especially [18], that may necessitate inclusion of

the temperature distribution inside grains into the kinetic description. Recent experiments

on rod-like particulates [19] demonstrated complicated rotational motion of dust grains. In

more general context, the rotation is also of importance for Brownian motion of the particles

with energy supply [20]. Although the rotation of spherical grains is hardly observable

experimentally, it is of interest since it may inﬂuence translational motion and heating of

2

the grain surface.

Being not quite complete, the above list of various process indicates that the dimension

of the phase space required for the kinetic description of the dust component may be rather

large: it tends to a rather large value of the order of twenty.

The main purpose of the present paper is to develop the kinetic theory of the aerosol

component taking into account the mass growth and the rotation of grains. Although our

main impetus is dusty plasma, here we ignore the process of grain charging. This may

be justiﬁed assuming the size of grains exceeds the Debye length of the ambient plasma.

In other words, we treat the ion component as a neutral gas and neglect the inﬂuence of

electrons. Another reason for accepting this simpliﬁcation is that we are able to study

the problem both analytically and by molecular dynamics simulation: computations with

charged moving grains are on the brink of or beyond contemporary computer capabilities.

Thus, we adopt here a following toy model of the aerosol component absorbing the am-

bient gas. The dust component consists of spherical rotating grains with variable mass and,

consequently, size and moment of inertia. Every atom hitting the grain surface is absorbed

by it, transferring therefore, its momentum, changing the mass of the grain and its angular

velocity. The process is inelastic since a part of projectile atom energy is spend for heating

the grain surface. It is assumed that the size of grains is small compared to the mean free

path of the ambient gas, however the gas distribution generally depends on the dust com-

ponent. Our main ﬁnding is that although there is no stationary state of this system, the

average kinetic and rotational energies of dust eventually tend to certain ﬁxed values, which

diﬀer from each other and the temperature of the ambient gas.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II A we discuss the process of the elementary

collision. Microscopic phase densities and corresponding equations generalizing Newtonian

dynamics are introduced in Sec. II B, the latter are used in Sec. II C to derive the Fokker-

Planck equation (20) describing the evolution of the dust distribution.

In Sec. II D we

obtain the homogeneous solution of the Fokker-Planck equation and evaluate the eﬀective

temperatures. The numeric algorithms are described in Sec. III A, then we discuss various

laws of collision used for simulations (Sec. III B). The results of simulations, which are in

fairly good agreement with analytical theory, are summarized in Sec. III C.

II. ANALYTIC THEORY

A. Elementary collision

We consider the dust component consisting of a number of spherical grains of variable

masses, M, and of mass dependent radii, a(M). Since we are interested in both translational

and rotational degrees of freedom, the state of a grain is described by the ten-dimensional

vector, Γ = (R, P , G, M), where P is the grain’s linear momentum and G is the angular

momentum relative its center of inertia, R. The angles describing the rotation are irrelevant

due to the sphericity of grains. The only collision process taken into account is the absorption

of an ambient gas by grains, i.e., every atom colliding a grain is assumed to attach to the

grain surface transferring its linear momentum, angular momentum and mass.

We assume that the process of collision elapses in two stages. At the ﬁrst stage the

atom attaches to the grain surface. Let r and p be the projectile atom coordinate and,

respectively, the momentum at the instant of collision; evidently,

= a(M). The net

angular momentum of the projectile atom and the grain prior to the collision is written as
P ′ + G′. Since after the

P + G, while after the collision M = R′

and P ′ = P + p, the conservation of angular momentum requires that

R′ =

mr + MR
M + m

G′ = G +

(r

−

(Mp

M + m

−

.

It should be noted that both G and G′ are independent of the reference frame.

In what follows we combine the above expressions in the convenient short-hand notation

for the process of collision:

(2)

Γ′ = Λ(Γ, r, p) = (

P + p, G +

, M + m).

The leap of the center of inertia (1) results in the non-conservative character of the

mapping (2): one can easily verify that its Jacobian

4

det

∂Λ(Γ)
∂Γ

=

M 3
(M + m)3

(3)

is less than unity.

Strictly speaking, the attachment of the atom to the grain surface makes the new com-

posite grain non-spherical. To avoid complications with non-spherical grains we assume that

at the second stage of the collision some inner forces redistribute the grain mass in such a

way that the grain shapes into a sphere. Evidently, this does not alter the grain phase

variable, Γ. Although this assumption seems a fairly natural simpliﬁcation, it may result in

non-physical behaviour because it leaves out the energy required for the mass redistribution.

Evidently, the process (2) is inelastic, that is, a part of the net mechanical energy is spent

for heating the grain surface, which evidently should be positive. (The grain heating is of

importance if one is going to consider the aerosol processes like thermophoresis.) Abandoning

for a moment the presumption of sphericity, the amount of heat released in the asymmetric

grain is written as

∆E =

absorption.

On the other hand, assuming the grain shapes into a sphere, the tensor of inertia is

isotropic and depends on the grain mass only, Iij = I(M)δij, I ′
ij = I(M + m)δij, and
analyzing Eq. (4) one can ﬁnd that ∆E is always positive if dI(M)/dM > a2(M). However,

it is easy to verify for an arbitrary spherically-symmetric mass distribution that the latter

inequality never holds. This means that some energy is required for the grain to shape

into a sphere and there exist a certain range of impact parameters, such that the available

5

mechanical energy is insuﬃcient for the mass redistribution. It should be noted that similar

phenomena are also known in nuclear physics (e.g., [21]).

Simple estimation shows that the assumption of sphericity results in the violation of the

energy conservation for atoms moving with characteristic velocities of the order of aΩ. In

the following we assume that the energy of rotation is of the order of the gas temperature

and the mass ratio, m/M, is small, i.e.

the discussed eﬀect is relevant for a very small

group of projectile atoms with velocity less than

m/M vT , where vT is the gas thermal

velocity. We ignore the inﬂuence of deviation from sphericity for this reason. Nonetheless,

p

the discussed eﬀect may play an important role for small clusters and, perhaps, it explains

the complex structure of ﬁne grains grown in a gas discharge.

B. Microscopic phase densities

In order to obtain the desired kinetic equation describing the grain motion we generalize

the well-known Klimontovich approach [22]. To describe the whole system the microscopic

phase densities are introduced:

Nd(Γ, t) =

δ(Γ

where the function Λ(Γ, r, p) is given by Eq. (2). The eﬀective cross-section σ(r, v, M)

2(r · v)θ(

r · v)δ(a2(M)

and θ(x) is the Heaviside’s step function.

The collision terms (9,10) are arranged in a following way. Suppose there is a trajectory

described by a time-dependent radius vector r(t). If the trajectory crosses the sphere of

radius a at the instant t0, i.e., r(t0) = a(M), then

σ(r, ˙r, M) = δ(t

t0).

−

The step function in (11) guarantees that the incoming intersection point, such that r(t0)

˙r(t0) < 0, is only taken into account.

Substituting the deﬁnitions of the microscopic phase densities (5,6) to Eqs. (9,10) and

making use of (12) one can verify that the collision terms are proportional to the sum of

δ (t

τiα), where τiα is the instant of collision of the i-th atom with the α-th grain. At the

−

time intervals between the collisions Eqs. (7,8) describe plain Newtonian dynamics. However,

at the instant of collision the microscopic phase densities change abruptly:

The purpose of this section is to expand Eqs. (9,10) in powers of the small mass ratio,

m/M. Averaging over the ensemble and ignoring binary correlations, we may treat Nd(Γ, t)

and Nn(p, r, t) as smooth one-particle distribution functions; in details the procedure was
discussed in [4]. Then we integrate over Γ′ in Eq. (9) and take into account Eq. (3) that

results in

(21)

and v is given by Eq. (16).

The physical meaning of the most of the coeﬃcients (21) and corresponding terms in

Eq. (20) is fairly obvious. J is the mass ﬂow at the grain surface, the last term in Eq. (20)

provides the mass growth of the dust component. The coeﬃcient si is the drag force acting

upon a grain, the quantities κij and ηij characterizes the diﬀusion in the momentum space.

The term proportional to Πij is just the Archimedean force in a non-uniform gas.

Since in the process of collision the angular momentum transferred to the grain is inde-

pendent of its angular velocity, there is no drag torque analogous to the ﬁrst term in Eq. (20).

This is the evident consequence of the adopted model. The drag torque may appear if one

takes into account the non-sphericity of grains or inelastic scattering of atoms by the grain

surface. Within the present model the drag torque is provided by spatial gradients and it

is characterized by the coeﬃcient σi. Since in the low velocity limit, P/M

p/m, σi is

≪

proportional to si, the drag torque may appear if the curl of the drag force is non-zero.

Of interest is the term proportional to γi in Eq. (20). It is non-vanishing if the grain

moves relative to the ambient gas and arises due to the change of the center of inertia in the

process of collision (1) or, in other words, γi describes the migration of the center of inertia

due to the asymmetric bombardment of the grain by gas atoms. Comparing the left-hand

side of (7) with this term we see that γi appears as an addition to the grain velocity, P /M. It

often happens that the ambient medium impose some forces at the particulate, an example

9

is the drag force, si. In this case one may say that the medium modiﬁes the second Newton’s

law. Here we face with the example of the ﬁrst Newton’s law altered by the ambient gas.

By the order of magnitude the drag force, si, is proportional to ǫ1/2, the eﬀective torque,

ǫ3/2, all other coeﬃcients are of the order of ǫ.

σi ∼

In the lowest-order approximation the kinetics of the gas component is reduced to the

absorption. The corresponding kinetic equation is readily obtained from Eq. (10):

derivation. These may be, e.g., interatomic collisions, gas creation by external source etc.

D. Eﬀective temperature

Suppose that the gas distribution, Nn(p), is homogeneous and isotropic. Since we as-

sume that the grain velocity is small compared to the gas thermal velocity, we neglect the

momentum dependence in all kinetic coeﬃcients (21) but the drag force, si, for which the

ﬁrst order term of expansion in powers of P /M should be kept. Therefore, there are only

three non-zero kinetic coeﬃcients (21), which are expressed in terms of mass ﬂow, J, and

Evidently, if all the grains are of the same mass and of the same mass growth rate, we

Explicitly, the asymptotic distribution is given by

It is a matter of direct substitution to verify that the latter distribution satisfy Eq. (25)

subject to relations (30,31).

Now we introduce the translational temperature, Tt(µ) = ∆t(µ)/µ, and the rotational

temperature, Tr(µ) = ∆r(µ)/I(µ), where I(µ) is the moment of inertia of a grain. Hereafter

we will ignore the dependence of the normalized energy, α, on µ: this will be the case

of particular examples discussed below. Then, as it follows from (30) the translational

temperature tends to a ﬁxed value

The asymptotic value of the rotational temperature is determined by the dependence of

its moment of inertia on the mass, i.e., by the inner structure of a grain. Of interest are two

cases. Suppose that the grain radius is independent of its mass: this will be referred to as
a spongy grain. Then, I = 2

5 µa2 and Eq. (31) results in

Another case is a solid or, more general, a fractal grain with µ

aD, where D is its
fractal dimension. Since the mass density is proportional to rD−3, the moment of inertia is

Now we turn to evaluation of the normalized energy, α (24). Although generally the

solution of the kinetic equation (22) is time-dependent and can deviate from the Maxwellian

distribution, there are reasons to ignore this deviation. Suppose as an example, that the

collision term Ia in Eq. (22) is represented by a sum of the Boltzmann integral describing

interatomic collisions and let’s assume some source term balancing the gas loss. Then,

with the dominating role of elastic interatomic collisions, the deviation from Maxwellian

distribution becomes negligible. Assuming that Nn is the Maxwellian distribution with the

temperature T0, we get ε = 2/3T0, i.e.

Of interest is that the kinetic dust temperature obtained under the same approxima-

tions but in neglecting the mass growth [4] is 2 T0. Therefore, the mass growth results in

appreciable cooling of the dust component.

At lower gas pressure the interatomic collisions are negligible and we have to take into

account the deviation of the ambient gas distribution from Maxwellian. Suppose there is

some bulk source of the Maxwellian gas, i.e. Ia in Eq. (22) is given by

The main results of this section may be summarized as follows. The momentum distri-



bution of the dust component absorbing the ambient gas tends to Maxwellian. Although

the average value of momenta are always growing, the corresponding temperatures tend to

certain ﬁxed values, which diﬀer from each other. Moreover, the rotational temperature

depends on the inner structure of dust grains.

In ignoring the mass growth, i.e., the last term in Eq. (25), the dust translational tem-

perature in the Maxwellian gas tends to 2T0 [4]. However, due to the absence of the friction

torque within the adopted model, there is no steady behaviour with respect to the rotational

degrees of freedom.

These conclusions were gathered assuming the mass dispersion is negligible. However,

the same inferences also follow from the general non-stationary solution of Eq. (25), which

may be obtained in a similar way but is too cumbersome to be adduced here.

III. NUMERIC SIMULATIONS

A. An algorithm

The simulations of the Brownian kinetics of a single grain were performed in a following

way. The computational area was a three-dimensional cube of unit length on edge in contact

with unbounded equilibrium gas. This contact was simulated by point atoms of unit mass,

which were randomly injected inside the cube from all of its faces and could freely leave the

computational area. For each atom leaving the cube, another atom with the random velocity

was injected from the random point of the random cube face. The distribution function of

the injected atoms was semi-Maxwellian.

14

It was veriﬁed that in the absence of dust grains the bulk distribution inside the cube was

Maxwellian with the prescribed temperature, T0. The average number of atoms depended

on the thermal velocity; in most runs it ﬂuctuated around 10000. Since there were no forces

acting upon atoms, their trajectories were straight lines.

The grain was represented by a movable sphere of a radius small compared to the cube

edge, typically, the initial size was a0 = 0.01.

If an atom hit the grain surface then it

transferred a part of its momenta to the grain according to some prescribed rules, which are

discussed below. In the case of absorbing grain, no new atom was injected into the cube

after the collision, that resulted in some reduction of density. Since the grain was initially

small, a very little part of atoms could actually experience the collision. The equations of

motion for both translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the grain were solved; the

time step was small compared to the average time between the collisions.

It was observed that some spurious force arose when the grain approached the faces of the

cube. To minimize the inﬂuence of this computational eﬀect the grain was conﬁned near the

center of the cube with the help of the auxiliary spherically-symmetric parabolic potential

well. The parameters of the well were chosen in such a way that even with the kinetic

energy of about 100 T0 the grain could not approach the faces of the cube. Evidently, such

a conﬁnement should result in multiplication of the grain distribution by a Boltzmannian

factor and could not alter the distribution over the kinetic energy. Moreover, in application

to the dusty plasma the conﬁnement appears in a natural way. The imposed auxiliary

potential did not inﬂuence the motion of atoms.

It is worth noting that although the mass of the grain could be as large as several millions

of atom masses, its mobility was crucial for our simulations. It was the temptation to avoid

the solution of the grain equations of motion by simply counting down the energy and

momentum transferred to the immobile grain. However, this way led nowhere: the grain

temperature was permanently increasing without any saturation.

The main goal of our simulations was to accumulate enough data in order to reconstruct

the grain distribution function over its kinetic and rotational energy. The translational or

rotational energy axis, say, 0 < E < 20 T0, was split in a number of sub-bands (usually, 50).

Two methods of averaging were used. First, we could trace the energy variation of a single

grain and evaluate the time it spent in each energy sub-band. Then, these time intervals

were summed up resulting in time-averaged distribution function.

15

Another method of averaging was the simulation of the canonical Gibbs ensemble. Ini-

tially, the grain was situated at the center of the cube, its rotational and kinetic energies

were chosen randomly using the random-number generators of Maxwellian distributions with

corresponding initial kinetic, Tt0, and rotational, Tr0, temperatures. The evolution of the

grain energies was recorded for the time period 0 < t < tmax. The obtained dependence rep-

resented a single sample from the Gibbs ensemble. The whole procedure was repeated many

times with varied random initial energies but the same initial temperatures. By counting

down a number of samples in each energy sub-band for a given time instant we were able to

reconstruct the time evolution of the energy distribution function.

It should be noted that reconstruction of the distribution over both kinetic and rotational

energies, f (Et, Er) requires too many samples or too long integration time. For this reason

we could evaluate only the distribution over kinetic, f (Et), or rotational, f (Er), energy

separately.

kinetic energy are plotted for the cold grain (

((cid:4)) and for absorbing grain (⋆). The distribution over rotational energy is shown for the case of

absorbing grain ((cid:7)). The solid curves correspond to Maxwellian distributions with T /T0 = 2 (1),

T /T0 = 1 (2) and T /T0 = 4/5 (3).

The “cold grain” is also described by Eqs. (2) but its mass remained unchanged; the same

law of collision was used in [4]. Physically, this corresponds to the diﬀuse scattering with

the complete energy accomodation at the cold surface, when the net atom momentum is

transferred to the grain and the inﬂuence of the scattered atom is negligible.

C. Simulation results

The simulations with specular reﬂections (43) were used to check the overall operation

of the code. Both averaging methods described above were used. It was observed that for

the relatively heavy grain (M/m = 100) after some thousands of collisions the distribution

function over the kinetic energy eventually tended to the Maxwellian distribution. The dust

temperature was equal to T0 with the accuracy less than 1%, as expected for the system in

the thermodynamic equilibrium. There was no relaxation in rotational degrees of freedom

because there was no coupling between translational and rotational motions.

The simulations with absorbing grain were performed with the solid grain, i.e. a(M)

∝
M 1/3. Although the computer facilities allowed us to monitor the motion of the grain for a

very long time, up to tens of millions collisions, it was found that no statistically signiﬁcant

result could be obtained with time-averaging method. The reason is fairly evident: with

17

FIG. 2: Temporal dependence of translational (solid line) and rotational (dashed line) tempera-

tures.

growing mass the grain motion slowed down, and it took more and more time for the grain

to migrate from one energy sub-band to another.

The ensemble averaging yielded more meaningful results. Several typical energy dis-

tributions in logarithmic scale are depicted in Fig. 1. The ﬁt curves there correspond to

Maxwellian distributions, i.e., F (E)

√E exp(

E/T ). Fig. 2 shows the temporal evo-

∝

−

lution of translational (solid line) and rotational (dashed line) temperatures. The initial

temperatures are Tt0 = 0.8 T0 and Tr0 = 1.3 T0. The time in Fig. 2 is measured in the units
of characteristic time of the mass growth, τM . According to Eq. (27), τM = M0/(4πa2

0J),

where M0 and a0 are the initial grain mass and radius, respectively. The averaging was

performed over the ensemble consisting of 1000 samples.

There was the sharp drop in translational temperature evolution at the beginning of the

computation. It originated due to the parabolic potential well, in which the grain was kept.

Initially the grain was situated at the bottom of the well, so its potential energy was zero.

Then, according to the virial theorem, half of its kinetic energy transferred to the potential

one. Since the potential well did not inﬂuence the grain rotation, there was no rotational

energy drop.

Eventually the dust translational temperature tends to

0.75 T0, that is, near the value

≈

given by Eqs. (37). The rotational temperature is also close to the value (38). Since there

was only one small grain, the distribution of projectile atoms was essentially Maxwellian

and we were unable to reproduce the solutions (41) and (42).

The simulations with the “cold grain” also conﬁrmed the analytical solution: the trans-

18

lational temperature tends to 2T0 while the rotational temperature is always growing.

IV. CONCLUSION

Although the simple model of the atom-grain inelastic collisions accepted in this paper

ignores some essential processes, it demonstrates many interesting features. We conﬁrmed

that the translational temperature of the dust component diﬀers from the temperature of

the ambient gas. However, we demonstrated that the “equilibrium” temperature is highly

sensitive to the details of the inelastic collision. In particular, taking into account the grain

mass growth results in appreciable reduction of the dust temperature. It should be noted

that the diﬀerence between various collision laws discussed above numerically is very small.

The discrepancies in energy balance of the order of a fraction of a tiny mass ratio are

accumulated and eventually result in considerable eﬀect. It is also worth pointing out that

the rotational temperature is sensitive even to the details of the inner structure of grain.

The important lesson, which may be drawn from the above discussion, is that there is

no thermodynamic equilibrium between dust and ambient gas. The statement itself is fairly

evident since a dusty plasma is an open system. However, this indicates the inapplicability

of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem, which is the basement of the Langevin approach to

the theory of Brownian motion. Therefore, the problem of deducing the Langevin equation

applicable to dusty plasmas arises.

Abstract. The pseudopotentials of particle interaction of a strongly coupled semi-

At the present time the study of strongly coupled plasmas properties is of great inter-

est, it caused by fundamental investigations of astrophysical objects and inertial conﬁne-

ment fusion plasmas [1]-[6]. In such strongly coupled systems the collective (screening)

and quantum-mechanical eﬀects play an important role in studies of thermodynamic and

kinetic properties of strongly coupled plasmas. Furthermore, in kinetic theory which is

based on kinetic equations, there are problems with divergence of collision integrals at

big and small scattering angles. The one way to eliminate them is the using of the bare

Coulomb potential, being cutted at large and short distances. On the other hand, it is

known that the divergence at small angles appears as a result of not taking into account

the plasma’s screening eﬀects on interparticles scattering in the system. The other method

of eliminating divergence at long ranges and correctly describing the properties of strongly

coupled plasmas is to use the eﬀective potentials of interaction of charged particles. These

potentials take into account the inﬂuence of surrounding particles, it leads to the screening

of external potential ϕ(r). Therefore, the strongly screened eﬀective potential that takes

into account three-particle correlations is obtained in [7]. Notice that this potential does

not take into account quantum mechanical eﬀects and describes the interaction between

particles of classical dense plasma only.

In this paper the eﬀective potential for semiclassical plasma is obtained. This potential

contains quantum diﬀraction eﬀects at short distances as well as screening eﬀects for large

distances.

II. The system parameters.

The fully ionized plasma consisting of electrons and ions is considered. Number density

is considered in the range of n = ne + ni = 1020 − 1024cm−3, and the temperature domain

is 105 − 107K. The average distance between particles (or the Wigner-Seitz radius) is :

where ni = Zne are number densities of ions and electrons. Other parameter character-

izing the state of system is coupling parameter:

where T is plasma temperature, kB denotes the Boltzmann constant, Γ is the ratio between

average Coulomb interaction energy and thermal energy. For strongly coupled plasma

a = (

3
4πn

)1/3,

Γ = (Ze)2/(akBT ),

2

Γ > 1.

Density parameter is deﬁned as

rs = a/aB,

where aB = ¯h

/(mee2) is Bohr radius, rs increases with decreasing of density.

The degree of Fermi degeneracy for the electrons is measured by the ratio:

Θ =

= 2(

kBT
EF

9π

)2/3Z 5/3 rs
Γ

,

where EF is the Fermi energy of electrons. The condition Θ ≥ 1 corresponds to the state

of weakly and intermediate degeneracy.

III. Pseudopotentials.

It is well -known that the electrical ﬁeld of particles in plasma induces the density

ﬂuctuations of charges, i.e.

the polarization eﬀect is evolved. As a consequence, the

opposite charged ”cloud” around test charged particle is formed, it leads to screening of

initial potential [8]. The relationship between the total (screened) potential and externally

applied one is as follows:

where Φ(q), ϕ(q) are Fourier transforms of the screened and external potentials, re-

spectively. Fourier transformation is:

ε(q) is the dielectric function of static screening. In the random-phase approach for weakly

degenerate plasma ε(q) can be derived from following relation [9]:

Φ(q) =

ϕ(q)
ε(q)

ϕ(q) =

rϕ(r)sin(qr)dr,

ε(q) = 1 +

In case of the Coulomb potential, we have:

ϕc(q) =

εc(q) =

4πe2
q2
q2 + κ2
q2

,

where κ2 = (4πne2)/(kBT ) ≡ 1/r2

D is the value that is inverse proportional to the square

of Debye radius. Using Eqs. (1),(4),(5), Fourier transform of eﬀective potential Φ(q) can

be obtained. The inverse Fourier transformation

gives well-known Debye-H¨uckel potential:

Φ(r) =

qΦ(q)sin(qr)dq,

e−κr.

Hence the divergence at the large distances is avoided by taking into account screening

eﬀects, but it still remains at short distances. However, it is known that taking into

consideration the quantum-mechanical eﬀects leads to the ﬁnite values of pseudopotential

at short distance. This method is called the method of thermodynamic pseudopotential,

and the eﬀective temperature dependent pseudopotential is obtained as a result of cor-

relation between the classical Boltzmann factor and the quantum-mechanical Slater sum

[10]. In this framework the potential taking into consideration eﬀects of diﬀraction has

been derived for high densities and temperatures [11], [13],[12]

ϕαβ(r) =

(1 − e−r/λαβ )

ZαZβe2
r

where λ = ¯h/

2πµαβkBT is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of α − β pair, µαβ is the

q

reduced mass of α − β pair. Potential (8) is not screened at large distances. It raises the

idea to obtain the eﬀective potential on the basis of the dielectric responce function as a

result of screening the potential (8). Applying Eqs.(2),(3),(1) to (8) we have obtained:
q4 + q2/λ2

αβ + κ2/λ2

ε(q) =

q2(q2 + 1/λ2

The pseudopotential Φαβ(r) can be restored from (6),(10) :

Φαβ(r) =

It is obvious that pseudopotential (11) is valid when 4λ2

αβκ2 < 1 (or λαβ < rD/2), i.e.

in the region of weakly degenerate plasmas.

Since potential (8) behaves as the Coulomb potential at large distances it is natural

to suppose that dielectric function is deﬁned by Coulomb’s relation (5). In this approach,

using expression (5) for ε(q) instead of (9), one can obtain the expression for eﬀective

potential:

Φαβ(r) =

ZαZβe2
1 − λ2

αβκ2 (

e−κr
r

−

e−r/λαβ
r

)

(12)

Let us consider the limiting cases of the expressions (11),(12).

Case 1. κ → 0(rD → ∞). From the physics point of view it means that there are no

screening eﬀects. Then potentials (11) and (12) coincide with (8).

Case 2. In the absence of diﬀraction eﬀects (λαβ → 0), from (11) and (12) we have

the potential (7).

Case 3. When both screening and diﬀraction eﬀects are absent (λαβ → 0, κ → 0),

pseudopotentials (11) and (12) coincide with the Coulomb potential.

Case 4. λαβκ << 1(λαβ << rD). In this case pseudopotential (11) coincides with

5

potential (8) and limiting formula of pseudopotential (12) is as follows:

Φαβ(r) =

(e−κr − e−r/λαβ ).

ZαZβe2
r

(13)

Similar limiting expression have been derived in [14] on the basis of the linear chain of

Bogolyubov’s equations in pair correlations approach by the micropotential taking into

consideration diﬀraction and symmetry eﬀects. It should be noted here that results of

[14] are valid for weak coupled plasmas ( Γ < 1).

The pseudopotentials (11) and (12) as a function of a distance between particles for

the diﬀerent values of parameters rs and Γ are presented on the ﬁgures. It is shown that

both potentials coincide with the Debye-H¨uckel potential at r → ∞ and they have ﬁnite

value at r → 0. Discrepancy between (11) and (12) grows with increasing of coupling

parameter at ﬁxed rs (Figs.1 , 2 and 3 ) and also with increasing of density at ﬁxed Γ

(Figs.3,4). Under the same conditions the discrepancy between limiting expression (13)

and pseudopotentials (11) , (12) grows too (Figs.5,6 and 7).

Consequently, pseudopotentials derived in this work take into account both quantum-

mechanical eﬀects of diﬀraction at short distances and also screening ﬁeld eﬀects at large

distances between particles. Last time some authors have calculated potentials which

take into consideration quantum-mechanical eﬀects and collective events [14],[15],[16] by

diﬀerent methods. However, analytical expression for pseudopotential which is valid in

wide region of rs and Γ has not been yet obtained.

In conclusion it should be noted here that the expressions for pseudopotentials derived

in this work are simple enough and can be easily used in analytical calculations and

computer simulations in investigations of strongly coupled semiclassical plasma properties.

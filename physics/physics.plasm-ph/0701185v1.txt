On the extrapolation to ITER of discharges in pressent tokamaks

An expression for the extrapolated fusion gain G = Pfusion/5Pheat (Pfusion being the total fusion
power and Pheat the total heating power) of ITER in terms of the conﬁnement improvement factor
(H) and the normalised beta (βN ) is derived in this paper. It is shown that an increase in nor-
malised beta can be expected to have a negative or neutral inﬂuence on G depending on the chosen
conﬁnement scaling law. Figures of merit like HβN /q2
95 should be used with care, since large values
of this quantity do not guarantee high values of G, and might not be attainable with the heating
power installed on ITER.

INTRODUCTION

In many tokamak devices discharge scenarios are stud-
ied with the aim of improving the performance of fu-
ture reactor experiments over the current design val-
ues. Essentially two ingredients enter in the optimisation:
the energy conﬁnement time and the Magneto-Hydro-
Dynamic (MHD) stability limit, represented by a critical
pressure. Both energy conﬁnement time and obtainable
pressure are measured in current experiments and then
for scaling purposes expressed in dimensionless parame-
ters. The conﬁnement improvement is given by the so-
called H-factor which measures the energy conﬁnement
time (τE) relative to a scaling law (τE,scaling). The ob-
) is expressed in

tainable volume averaged pressure (

2µ0p/B2 measured in %, a is the minor radius in m,
B is the magnetic ﬁeld in T, and Ip is the plasma current
in MA. For the extrapolation one assumes a constant H-
factor and then uses the conﬁnement scaling to determine
the conﬁnement time in a next step device. Furthermore,
it is assumed that the working point of the reactor is at
the same normalised pressure βN . The H-factors de-
scribe our imperfect knowledge of the scaling of conﬁne-
ment, i.e. the conﬁnement in current day experiments in
some areas of the parameter space scales diﬀerently than
the developed scaling laws suggest. Of course, the use of
a constant H-factor is a daring approach to correct for
this lack of knowledge, but nevertheless can give some
idea of how conﬁnement could be diﬀerent in the next
step experiment.

Diﬀerent scenarios for improved performance have
been proposed (see for an overview [1]). These scenar-
ios include the internal transport barriers (ITB) as well
as the diﬀerent scenarios for the improvement of the H-
mode. The results presented in this paper can in prin-
ciple be applied to all scenarios, but as examples only

the H-mode scenarios will be shown The latter scenarios
are an active area of research with many contributions
from diﬀerent machines, for instance, ASDEX Upgrade
[2], DIII-D [3], JET [4], and JT60-U [5]. (Although the
original reference [2] refers to an internal transport bar-
rier it was shown in a later paper [6] that the ion tem-
perature proﬁles follow the same scaling as those of the
standard H-mode).

An improvement in conﬁnement or MHD stability
would allow to operate the next step tokamak experiment
ITER [7, 8] at a higher energy multiplication factor Q, a
higher fusion power, or a higher bootstrap current frac-
tion. We deﬁne the energy multiplication factor Q and
the fusion gain G as

Q =

Pfusion
Paux

,

G =

Pfusion
5Pheat

where Pfusion is the total fusion power, Paux is the exter-
nally applied heating power, and Pheat is the total heating
power of the plasma, which in steady state is equal to the
loss power Ploss. Since one ﬁfth of the fusion power heats
the plasma, Pheat = Pfusion/5 + Paux and there is a direct
relation between G and Q

(2)

(3)

G =

Q
Q + 5

The currently proposed next-step experiment ITER [8]
is designed to reach Q = 10, and any realistic scenario to
be tested in this experiment should reach a Q value sig-
niﬁcantly larger than one. Scenarios at suﬃciently large
Q might be further optimised to reach a higher fusion
power, or to reach a higher bootstrap current fraction.
The latter optimisation is known as the hybrid scenario.
It aims at the extention of the pulse length at similar
performance as the design value. It is important for the
results presented in this paper to stress that improve-
ments in fusion power or bootstrap fraction can only be
of interest if the the energy multiplication factor is suf-
ﬁciently high. In the opinion of the authors a good rep-
resentation of the extrapolated performance of current

discharges towards ITER can only be obtained if one of
the ﬁgures of merit is directly connected with Q. Other
ﬁgures could be used to measure the bootstrap current
and fusion power. Although Q plays a central role in
the ITER experiment their is no published simple scal-
ing that allows a direct assessment of the extrapolated
value of current discharges. A simple way to obtain a
rough estimate can be extremely useful in assessing the
progress made in this large area of research. Finally, we
would like to stress that our extrapolation formula aims
at judging the performance in ITER and is not necessar-
ily applicable for more general purposes. In particular we
use a ﬁxed size and magnetic ﬁeld. A reactor design can
also be optimised through changes in these parameters.

Here CX is a constant, M is the eﬀective mass in AMU,
and κ is the plasma elongation. The exponents α are the
exponents of the scaling law. For the projection to ITER
the plasma size (a,R,κ) as well as the magnetic ﬁeld B
and the eﬀective mass M are assumed to be given by the
design values. For the density a ﬁxed ratio of the Green-
wald limit (nGr) [9] will be used, i.e. n
In
our ﬁnal result it will not be diﬃcult to obtain the result
at constant density (i.e. the design value of the density

without considering a scaling of this density with plasma
current) since the density dependence that enters can be
easily identiﬁed through the coeﬃcient αn, which can be
set to zero to obtain the result for a given ﬁxed density.
Note that we cannot assume Ploss to be constant, since
discharges at diﬀerent beta will extrapolate to a diﬀer-
ent fusion power and, hence, to diﬀerent plasma heating
powers. Since for ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld and plasma shape

in the ideal condition if it is assumed that there is no
power degradation. We note that one can deﬁne a ﬁg-
ure of merit in diﬀerent ways and that HβN /q2
95 can
be thought of as a combination of good conﬁnement,
and high fusion power [16]. Also for the generic scal-
ing (αP =
0.5) the bootstrap current in a reactor close
to ignition scales as HβN [17]. It is, however, clear that
HβN /q2
95 does not provide a ﬁgure of merrit for G. This
point is important because it shows that one must be
careful in using HβN /q2
95. From the scaling Eq. (19)
it follows that the diﬀerence with the ﬁgure of merit
HβN /q2
(1.8HH/βN )2. The latter quantity is for
discharges with normal conﬁnement HH = 1 but high
normalised pressure βN = 3.6 as small as 0.25. This
makes a large diﬀerence in G. The above example with
HH = 1, βN = 3.6, and q95 = 4.2 reaches a value for the
parameter HH βN /q2
95 that suggest that the ITER tar-
get (Q = 10) could be reached, whereas in reality such
a discharges would extrapolate to Q = 1. Not only is
this value of little interest, it also requires a rather large
heating power, since the fusion power is four times larger
and energy multiplication is much smaller. The other
scaling laws suﬀer from the same problem, although it is
less dramatic due to the diﬀerent exponents of H as well
as βN .

Several papers have pointed out the fact that the absence
of the beta dependence in τE leads at high normalised
pressure to more optimistic projections for ITER com-
pared with IPB98(y,2) scaling [10, 15].

To obtain the scaling expressions for G a standard sce-
nario must be deﬁned. Here q95S = 3 and βN S = 1.8
will be used. The H-factors (HXS) can be calculated by
dividing the target conﬁnement time by the conﬁnement
times of the scaling calculated using Eqs. (12), (13), (14),
and (15). In the latter equations the ITER parameters
(Ip = 15 MA, B = 5.3 T, R = 6.2 m, κ = 1.75, n = 1020
m−3, a = 2 m, M = 2.5, P = 87 MW, τE = 3.68 s) are
used, yielding HHS = 1., HLS = 2.2, HCS = 1.07, and
HEGB,S = 0.8. One then directly ﬁnds

with the values of the constant C and the scaling poten-
tial giving in Table I. From this table it can be seen that
βN has a strongly negative eﬀect in the IPB98(y,2) scal-
ing, and a rather small eﬀect in all the other scalings. It

is clear from Eq. (11) that G
N occurs only for the
generic scaling τE

For the derivation of a ﬁgure of merit one often ap-
proximates the coeﬃcients of the scaling law. For a bet-
ter comparison we can make the similar approximations,
i.e. αI = 1, αn = 0, and αp =
2/3 for the IPB98(y,2)
and αp =

Some confusion can arise when considering the scaling
in terms of the dimensionless parameters β, normalised

even for the electro-static gyro-Bohm scaling. Therefore
we arrive at the conclusion that for a given design reach-
ing the beta limit does not help in increasing G. Of course
the density scaling is more hidden in our approach since
it is considered to be a design value. One can derive that
G increases strongly with density for all scalings.

Finally, it is noted here that for constant heating power

Having derived a simple expression that directly al-
lows to evaluate G, a suggestion is made in this section
for a diagram that should allow for an easy assessment
of the extrapolated performance of any discharge. From
the discussion above it is clear that a better representa-
tion of the data can be obtained by plotting the scaling
for G = Q/(Q + 5). against either the scaling of the fu-
sion power, i.e. β2
95, or the scaling of the bootstrap
current, i.e. q95βN . Since both are of importance it is
useful to mark the diﬀerent q95 values by diﬀerent sym-
bols in whatever plot one chooses. This makes that all
important parameters can be estimated from the same
graph.

[15]. Using the
explicitly added compared with Ref.
β1.25+Y it was concluded [15] that for the
scaling G
IPB98(y,2) scaling (X =
0.9) there is no large bene-
−
ﬁt of going to high β since Q increases only moderately
with β (β0.35), whereas for the energy conﬁnement scal-
ings that have no beta dependence it would be largely
β1.25. This
advantageous to go to the β limit since G
conclusion seems in disagreement with the results derived
in this paper, which rather point at a decreasing G with
βN for the IPB98(y,2) scaling and a G independent of βN
for the other scaling laws. Eq. (22) is the correct dimen-
sionless expression, but it must be noted that the scaling
β1.25+Y holds only at constant normalised
with beta G
Larmor radius (ρ∗) as well as collisionality (ν∗). The dif-
ference with the results in this paper is that the results
are evaluated for a ﬁxed machine size, density, and mag-
netic ﬁeld. With these assumptions it is not possible to
change β independently of ρ∗ and ν∗. At ﬁxed density
the β scaling is essentially a temperature scaling, leading
to changes in the normalised Larmor radius as well as
the collisionality. Using the scalings of ρ∗ and ν∗ one can
derive from Eqs. (16), (17), and (22)

sense that the highest q95βN values no longer reach the
ITER target for Q. These discharges have only moder-
ate conﬁnement improvements and high βN leading to a
relatively small (HH /βN )2. In the diagrams Q can ex-
ceed inﬁnity, which is obviously unphysical. For those
discharges for which Q >
, the temperature will rise

until the fusion cross section no longer scales quadrat-
ically with T , violating the original assumptions in the
derivation, and leading to a smaller increase of the fusion
power with T . This stabilises the solution and leads to

In the diagrams presented so far the external heating
power is still implicit. A better insight of how much ex-

For a ﬁxed auxiliary heating power the relation above de-

grams before, plotting G = Q/(Q + 5) versus the fusion

high pressure discharges at low Q values would require
a large amount of installed heating power to be run. It
is this diagram that carries the largest amount of infor-
mation and we propose it to be used when representing
larger datasets of advanced scenario discharges.

The diagrams presented in this paper are far from per-
fect, with several eﬀects not properly accounted for: Ra-
diated power due to Bremsstrahlung as well as dilution
of the fuel are not properly scaled. The approach with
constant H-factor and βN is always daring for an extrap-
olation. If better MHD stability is, for instance, reached
through current proﬁle shaping, then one should investi-
gate if such a shaping is extrapolatable to reactor param-
eters. Also, although βN is a good scaling quantity for
ideal MHD instabilities, it does not provide a very good
scaling for the NTM, which is often found to limit the

attainable beta. Nevertheless for the representation of

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper a scaling for tokamak discharges is de-
rived that directly measures the fusion gain G = Q/(Q +
5), and which are consistent with the underlying scaling
laws. It is shown that βN does not have a positive in-
ﬂuence on G, although it does of course extrapolate to a
larger fusion power. Care is to be taken with ﬁgures of
merit like HβN /q2
95. Although this ﬁgure of merit does
measure a combination of good conﬁnement and high fu-
sion power, the ITER target value of such a quantity does
not automatically imply a discharge with a suﬃciently
high Q, and might not be attainable with the limited
heating power that will be installed. A proposal is made
for a graphical representation in which both the extrap-
olated Q as well as the fusion power or the bootstrap
fraction can be directly assessed.

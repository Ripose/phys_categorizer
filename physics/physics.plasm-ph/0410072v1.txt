We present a theoretical and numerical study of the self-steepening and shock formation of large-
amplitude dust ion-acoustic waves (DIAWs) in dusty plasmas. We compare the non-dispersive
two ﬂuid model, which predicts the formation of large amplitude compressive and rarefactive dust
ion-acoustic (DIA) shocks, with Vlasov/ﬂuid simulations where ions are treated kinetically while a
Boltzmann distribution is assumed for the electrons.

Shukla and Silin [1] predicted the existence of small
amplitude dust ion-acoustic waves (DIAWs) in an un-
magnetized dusty plasma.
In the DIAWs, the restor-
ing force comes from the pressure of inertialess elec-
trons, while the ion mass provides the inertia to sup-
port the waves. On the timescale of the DIAWs, charged
dust grains remain immobile, and they aﬀect the over-
all quasi-neutrality of the plasma. When the dust grains
are charged negatively, one has the depletion of the elec-
trons in the background plasma. Subsequently, the phase
speed [ω/k = (ni0/ne0 + 3Ti/Te)1/2Cs, where ni0 (ne0) is
the unperturbed ion (electron) number density, Ti (Te)
is the ion (electron) temperature, Cs = (Te/mi)1/2 is the
ion acoustic speed, and mi is the ion mass] of the DI-
AWs becomes larger than the usual ion-acoustic speed in
an electron-ion plasma without negatively charged dust,
since ni0 > ne0. When ni0 ≫ ne0 or Ti ≫ Te, small-
amplitude DIAWs do not suﬀer Landau damping in a
plasma, since the increased phase speed is much larger
than the ion thermal speed (Ti/mi)1/2. Small-amplitude
DIAWs have been observed in laboratory experiments [2],
and the observed phase speed is in an excellent agreement
with the theoretical prediction of Ref. [1].

Recently, laboratory experiments [3, 4, 5, 6] have been
conducted to study the formation of dust ion-acoustic
(DIA) shocks in dusty plasmas. Dust ion acoustic com-
pressional pulses have been observed to steepen as they
travel through a plasma containing negatively charged
dust grains. Theoretical models [7, 8] have been proposed
to explain the formation of small amplitude DIA shocks
in terms of the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, in
which the dissipative terms comes from the dust charge
perturbations [9]. Popel et al. [10] have included sources
and sinks in the ion continuity equation, linear ion pres-
sure gradients in the nonlinear ion momentum equation
with a model collision term, as well as the dust grain
charging equation to study the formation DIA shock-
wave structures.

In this Brief Communication, we present analytical and
numerical studies of large amplitude DIA shock waves
in an unmagnetized dusty plasma [11]. We use fully
nonlinear continuity and momentum equations for the
warm ion ﬂuid, as well as Boltzmann distributed elec-
trons and the quasi-neutrality condition to examine the
spatio-temporal evolution of large amplitude dust ion-
acoustic pulses. We ﬁnd simple-wave solutions of our
fully nonlinear two ﬂuid model, and compare them with
those deduced from the time-dependent Vlasov simula-
tions which uses initial conditions corresponding to the
ones obtained from our theoretical model.

We consider an unmagnetized dusty plasma whose
constituents are singly charged positive ions, electrons
and charged dust grains. Thus, at equilibrium, we have
ni0 = ne0−ǫZdnd0, where ǫ equals −1 (+1) for negatively
(positively) charged dust grains, Zd is the number of el-
ementary charges residing on the dust grain, and nd0 is
the equilibrium dust number density. On the timescale of
our interest, the dust grains are assumed to be immobile.
The dynamics of low phase speed (in comparison with
the electron thermal speed) nonlinear, dust ion-acoustic
waves is governed by a Boltzmann distribution for the
electrons

and the continuity and momentum equations for the ions

In the following, we consider non-dispersive DIAWs,
and use the quasi-neutrality condition ne = ni + ǫZdnd0
instead of Eq. (4), together with the normalized variables

τ = ωpit, where ωpi = (4πni0e2/mi)1/2 is the ion plasma

where α = ne0/ni0 and η = Ti0/Te. In obtaining Eq. (5),

Eq. (1) and the quasineutrality condition.

In order to study the nonlinear evolution of large am-
plitude DIAWs, we seek simple wave solutions [12] of
Eqs. (5) and (6). For this purpose, we rewrite them in
the matrix form as

which, as long as N is continuous, has the general so-
lution N = f0(ξ), where ξ = x − λ+(N )t and f0 is the
initial condition for N . We have plotted λ+ as a func-
tion of N in Fig. 1. Here, we see that λ+ grows with
increasing N in the two cases with α = 0.25. In the case

with λ = 0.05, however, the phase speed ﬁrst decreases
for N ≈ 1 before increasing with increasing N . In the
small-amplitude limit, viz. N = 1+N1, where |N1| << 1,
we have the ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion λ+ = c + γN1,
where c = (1/α + 3η)1/2 is the linear acoustic speed and
γ = (3α+ 12ηα2 − 1)/2α(α+ 3ηα2)1/2 is the coeﬃcient in
front of the nonlinear term. We note that γ is negative
for suﬃciently small α (in agreement with the α = 0.05
case displayed in Fig. 1), and in the cold ion limit (η = 0)
we recover the result that α < 1/3 leads to a negative co-
eﬃcient [8, 13] in front of the nonlinear term. The linear
acoustic speed increases when α decreases. Thus, in the
presence of negatively charged dust, the phase speed of
the waves may becomes much larger than the ion acous-
tic speed, so that the Landau damping of the waves de-
creases [1].

In order to compare the ﬂuid and kinetic theories, we
have solved the coupled Eqs.
(5) and (6) numerically
and compared the results with numerical solutions of the
Vlasov equation. As an initial condition for our ﬂuid
simulations, we take a large-amplitude localized density
pulse, N = 1.5 − 0.5sech[3 sin(2πz/20000) + 1.5], while
the initial condition for the velocity is obtained from the
1 [1/N ′(N ′ + α − 1) +
simple wave solution as u(N ) =
3η]1/2 dN ′. The results are compared with numerical so-

where we are using the same initial condition for the den-
sity N and the velocity u as in the ﬂuid simulations. For
the scaled (by Ti0) ion temperature T , we obtain an ini-
tial condition by combining the ideal gas law P = N T ,
where P = Pi/Pi0 is the normalized ion pressure and
the adiabatic law P = N 3, giving the initial condition
T = N 2.

In Fig. 2, we present a comparison between the density
proﬁles obtained from the ﬂuid and Vlasov simulations,
at diﬀerent times. In the upper panel, the ion-electron
temperature ratio η = 0.1, and the electron-ion density
ratio α = 0.25. We see that both the ﬂuid (left) and
Vlasov (right) solutions exhibit shocks, where the shock
front is distinct in the ﬂuid solution and more diﬀuse in
the Vlasov solution. The corresponding ion distribution
function is displayed in Fig. 3. We observe that the for-
mation of the shock at t = 3400 is located at z ≈ 7000.
It is associated with a “kink” in the distribution func-
tion. A population of ions have also been accelerated by
the shock. The middle panels of Fig 2 are for η = 0.1

and α = 0.25. Here, the ﬂuid solution exhibits clear
shocks, while the Vlasov simulation shows only a phase
of self-steepening at t = 500, followed by an expansion of
the diﬀuse shockfont at t = 1000. The ion distribution
function in Fig. 4 shows that the shockfront is strongly
Landau damped for this case. Finally, the bottom panels
of Fig. 2 show results for α = 0.05 and η = 1. In this

4

rear end of the pulse, the distribution function forms a
“kink,” clearly seen at z ≈ −6000 in the bottom panel.

We have also performed simulations with smaller am-
plitudes of the pulses (not shown here) and they exhibit
essentially the same behavior as in the large-amplitude
case.
It is interesting to note that it is the strongly
heated and shock-accelerated ions in the pulse that leads
to Landau damping by overtaking the pulse. The heat-
ing of the ions is due to adiabatic compression, lead-
ing to a higher thermal speed of the ions inside the
pulse than in the equilibrium plasma. Another eﬀect
is that the ﬂuid (mean) velocity of the ions further ac-
celerates the ions. For Landau damping to be unimpor-
tant, we thus have the condition that the wave speed
must be much larger than the sum of the ion thermal

the inequality λ+ ≫ VT + u, where the scaled ion ther-
mal speed VT = (ηT )1/2 ≈ η1/2N , we obtain the con-
dition N 1/2[1/(N + α − 1) + 3ηN ]1/2 ≫ (ηN 2)1/2, or
(1/[(N +α−1)N η]+3)1/2 ≫ 1. This condition is fulﬁlled
if η ≪ 1 (leading to the sharp shock seen in Fig. 3 and
the upper right panel of Fig 2) or/and if the electrons are
evacuated due to the dust so that α ≪ 1, and at the same
time N ≈ 1. The latter corresponds to the case where
the sign of the coeﬃcient in front of the low-amplitude
nonlinear term becomes negative, so that there will be
a shock in the rear end of the pulse while the front of
the shock expands, in agreement with the observations
in Fig. 5 and lower right panel of Fig 2. The expansion
of the shockfront at high dust densities has also been
observed in the experiment [3].

To summarize, we have presented the dynamics of fully
nonlinear, nondispersive dust ion acoustic waves in an
unmagnetized dusty plasma. By using the Boltzmann
electron distribution as well as the hydrodynamic equa-
tions for the warm ion ﬂuid and quasi-neutrality con-
dition, we have represented the governing equations in
the form of a master equation whose characteristics have
been found analytically. The ﬂuid equations has been
solved to obtain the density and velocity proﬁles of the
DIA shock waves, which exhibit the steepening of the
waveforms both in the front and rear depending upon
the values of α. We have also compared our theoretical
results with those obtained from computer simulations of
the time dependent Vlasov equation. The Vlasov solu-
tion shows a diﬀuse shock in the front end of the pulse,
due to strong Landau damping, while a sharp shock de-
velops in the rear end of the pulse, similar to the results
from the simulation of Eqs. (5) and (6).

case, the ﬂuid solution again shows a shock in the front
end of the pulse, but also the rear end of the shock steep-
ens, which can be seen at z ≈ −6000 for t = 1000. The
steepening of the pulse for low-amplitude density per-
turbations in the rear of the pules can be explained by
that the wave speed decreases for small-amplitude den-
sity perturbations (N < 1.1), as seen in Fig. 1, while
it increases again for large-amplitude density perturba-
tions. The Vlasov solution again shows a diﬀusive shock
in the front, while it reproduces the steepening of the den-
sity in the rear of the pulse. In the middle panel of Fig.
5, the ion distribution function shows the self-steepening
phase of the shockfront, and the lower panel shows the
diﬀusion of the shock by shock-accelerated ions. In the

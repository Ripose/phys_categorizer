About some Information and Logical Properties
of Semiconductor Multistable Plazma

A. Manoogian st.1, Yerevan, Republic of Armenia, 375025

Some information and logical properties of multistable semi-conductor plazma are
discussed and the concept of physical logic system Lp on their basis is entered. Lp
contains exclusively values of some quantitative characteristic physical size of plazma
and transformation of a set of such sizes by means of plazma-ﬁeld interaction.

The opportunity nonmathematical (physical) calculation in Lp is considered and as
an example by symbols Lp are submitted classical arithmetic-logic actions, i.e. their
physical models in system Lp are found.

1. Physics in information science

Quantum physics played rather funny role in informational - computing technologies. It
raised on a qualitatively new level the sphere of implementation of mathematical calculus on
the basis of the Boolean logicians. Achievements in the ﬁeld of technologies, algorithms and
the architectures have provided and continue to provide huge successes. But the quantum
physics itself by its laws braked the powerful triumph of a classic electronics engineering, lim-
iting a capability of mathematical computers and giving rise principled crisis in information
technologies.

The germs of this crisis were pledged also in the fundaments of the physical theories and
have preceded the semiconducting electronics engineering, born by the quantum mechanics.
Thus the basis served not only the boundedness fundamental constant 0 < h1, k, c <
, but
also information and logical bases of the physical theories [1-7]

∞

Germs of crisis of became more subjected by the appearance of integral technology and

microelectronics, also born by the quantum physics [8,9]

The completion of this process became the appearance of nonostructure on the stage.
It became evident that if to keep the operational principles of mathematical calculus on the
basis of the Boolean logician, some broad classes of problems will be unsolved also in this
case [6, 7, 10-13]

As convincingly enough has pointed R. Feynman [6] this crisis, arisen because of physical

limitations, necessarily must be overcome by the physics.

1

From a ﬁniteness of universal constants the sequence of the following simple facts follows:
for implementation of the operation (conversion, carry, processing, storage etc.) above one
bit of the information of a physical system (PS) the ﬁnite time, volume of space, power
consumptions and negentropies are necessary, which are the characteristics of PS. Any classic
association (i.e. with the classiced correlate parallelism) m such PS for n acts can process
the information no more, than nk(m) of bits, thus the characteristic of collective k(m) <
.
It means, that under such prescription only polynomial restricted algorithms are feasible.

∞

Besides on the basis of the classic (determined) machine it is possible to model classic
probabilities, and the quantum probabilities can only be imitated, as legibly enough argued
R. Feynman [6,7] Even for their imitation it is necessary to know beforehand about prop-
erties of quantum probabilities, and for modeling it is necessary, that the machine itself
had properties of quantum probabilities, i.e. logic nonclassical, accepting a superposition of
condition and its interference.

In connection with it, it is possible to distinguish two main reasons, responsible for
the currently arisen crisis in informational computing technologies; at ﬁrst, the information
eﬃciency of the elementary act of calculus is minimum, in second the classic logical basis of
calculus itself is minimum.

Both reasons are partially interdependent, therefore clearly or not clearly, they must
appear simultaneously. It is visually visible on a model example q-bit, which is represented
and their coherent superposition (indeterminated

Because of existing correlation between ? Here α condition is arbitrary therefore possesses a
huge quantity of information, and its indeterminated nature is a lien for applying q-bit PS
in modeling of quantum probabilities.

It is necessary to mark, that thanks to α we manage to receive quantum - PS from

Unlike (1), in (2) ﬁgure (k
1) indeﬁnite elements, therefore the last describes more consistent
logical system. This example demonstrates, that the diﬃculties in information technologies
have arisen not because of the physical laws and PS, but because they are not suﬃciently
used. The informational and logical properties of the nature are much wider, than the cur-
rently used the one-bit information science and Boolean logician.

In order to use PS in computing process more eﬀectively, we shall return to the analysis

of the essence of activity of the mathematical computing (MCM).

2

The input information - datas and algorithms, is represented on the basis of algebraic
pattern. However, MCM executes only logic operations of logical system (Boolean algebra
of logicians), therefore it is necessary at ﬁrst to pass in algebra the logicians (if necessary
can be intermediate transition in a system with binary coding). Later, all the present logic
operations in algorithm are executed, then all reconversions are made in converse order.
The logical reasoning or not obviously are present in any link of calculus processing (for
example, for compiling algorithm, or some rule, or, program of calculus). But all of them
are executed outside of the machine, in which only the logical operations and information
transfer are executed. And the mideast role of physics consists here in implementation of
these latests under the simple scheme; to presence of the information carrier (signal) is
confronted the true expression, to the absence - false, and the logical operations (functions)
became conversion of input signals in output in accordance with functional settings of these
operations. The nature of mathematical calculus is those. But this is not the only way to
realize calculus. It is possible to make calculus of other nature, physical, without logical
or further without arithmetic operations, and to receive the same result but in the other
conception.Two circumstances support this proposal [2,5,14,17]

1. Information quantitative measure of order (on some parameter) PS - is a physical

quantity which is capable:

to be latent in system,

•

•

•

•

•

is entered in a system and is injected from a system,

is transferred in space and time both inside the system and outside of it,

to be converted in a system,

to interact in a system with other informations and physical quantities.

2. In PS (and processes in them) deﬁnite logical resources are hidden (logical expressions,
formulas, operations etc.) correspondent to the physical laws and legitimacies operat-
ing in the system. The information demonstrates a fraction of negentropy which has
been turned into the order on the given set of PS microcondition, and the expression
presents a measure of rejection from chaos at the given microcondition, or, that is
equivalent to a measure of veracity (verity) of transformation of the negentropy in the
internal order PS in the given microcondition. On the other hand, the information
presents a ranked measure of PS and is the quantitative physical characteristic of set
of all microcondition, the logical expression quantitatively describes concrete (discrete)
condition, introducing a measure and regularity of transformation of negentropy into
the information at the presence of the given condition.

Thus, there are at least partial conformity between a physical quantity ξp, describing the
given microcondition, by the expression ξℓ, introduced microcondition, and abstract number
ξh, and correspondently by the physical operations above set
, logic operations above
set ξℓ and algebraic operations on

ξh

ξp

}

{

.

Just the conformity of algebras of quantitative abstract numbers and the logicians have
resulted to MCM. In mechanical machines (for example ”Feliks”, system of interdependent

{

}

3

neuron) the arithmetic operatings are made through algebra of logicians located in our mind,
i.e. ”Feliks” is not the independent machine. The program of calculus is also stored outside
of the machine.

In classic computers the Boolean algebra of logicians is realized, therefore transition to
binary algebra is previously committed. Here outside of the machine is the main part of
logician, the remaining is inside it.

In both cases the conformity with physics is not used, in view of which it is possible to

make calculus, even partially using latent logician of PS.

Moreover, it is possible to take such set of PS, that latent logician has ensured the
existence of the logical system, which was selfcontained and full for the given purpose (let’s
say, for the implementation of arithmetic operations). The physical quantities (quantum
quantity of microcondition) and physical operators should ﬁgure, basically, in this logical
system, therefore we shall call physical and we shall designate through Lp. Lp not necessarily
should be algebra of the logicians, but can contain such (for example, Boolean algebra
logicians). By eligible selection PS it is possible to construct algebraic pattern above Lp
and to write algorithms of calculus and the applicable machine will be physical.

For more visual demonstrating of these ideas and their reality, below is presented one

such example: the simplest physical logical system multivalued and determined.

2. Calculus on the basis of multistable plazma

The intuitive extension of the logical fundamentals of calculus is connected with transition
in the multivalued logician. In order the internal logician is multivalued, it is necessary the
PS to be multistable.

In the nature there are a lot of PS with multirepeatability on any parameter: optical,
electrical, q-bits, neurons, quantum (Josephson eﬀect, quantum Hall eﬀect and i.e.), each of
which can spawn some diﬀerent logical systems. From behind such outrage more eﬀectively
at ﬁrst it is purposeful to select satisfactory logical pattern Lp, which will dictate itself PS
or functional properties.

Let us have diﬀerent ξi of values of convertible value ordered in ascending order and

The abstract number i

set elementary physical transformations of condition Hk (i.e. we shall deﬁne the physical
operators above Hk).

if only we do not want, to construct the logician or algebra of logicians on Lp.

−

In order to demonstrate thessence of information and logical transformations of PS more
visually we shall consider a particular example, perhaps K-polistor on the basis of multistable
semiconducting EHP [8, 16-19] As was already said, by these conditions were conditioned
the latent information and logician polistor. Let the external information be received by the
located in non -equilibrium stationary state polister by a conjunctive set of control signals.
The physical nature of the information (and logicians) means, that, apart from energy,
deﬁnite quantity of a negentropy is received in a system (proportionally to the norm of the
input condition) in the addition of there existing negentropy. Now in polistor joint actions
of both negentropies place joint actions of both negentropies take place which are capable to
induce in the system the new order, if there is such a capability. In EHP the ordering can be
made in relation to the contributions of diﬀerent sorts of electrons and vacant electron sites,
say, by relation of the number of electrons passing through a barrier to number of electrons,
passing above a barrier; relation of electrons and vacant electron sites were used in formation
of diﬀerent conditions. The ordering on such parameter in space is localized on a place of
receipt of the information. At the same time for implementation of transformation of the
information with deﬁnite logic (regularity), it is necessary, that the proceeding information
is spread on all PS. Such information ﬁeld can be created in EHP by eﬀect of plasma-ﬁeld
interplay.

After installation of this ﬁeld, if the norm of the input condition (the entered negen-
tropy) surpasses some threshold (or a little from them), at the expense of an external power
source and entropy in the polistor a new condition is organized and the transformation of
the input condition is realized. It is a kind of physical interplay of the external and internal
orders and logical expressions with participation of external sources. For K polistor in Hk
some physical conditions, due to a permutation symmetry of a conjunctive bracket, are logi-
cally indiscernible (i.e. have the identical norm, therefore, describe the identical expressions)
and make equivalence classes. If make of these classes the factor set Hk/Lp, there will be P
members in it, when in Hk exist Pk conditions. And the property of K polistor is to make
logic operation (physical transformation of the norms of condition), is conditioned by that
lawfulness (is enclosed in it), according to which Hk/Lp is imaged in Shm. k-imagery Hk in

6

Shm, agrees (6), is not one, but those is the k-imagery Hk/Lp in Sh1. The last becomes log-
ically convertible, remaining physically irreversible. Analyzing all characters Lp, we come to
a conclusion, that apart from customary values, the information and logician have physical
nature. In PS, particularly in polistors, there are quantitative conformity between its physi-
cal, information and logical quantitative characteristics and physical operatings above them,
and also Lp is algebraic pattern, (but not by algebra), physical quantities and operators.

How much last is valid for representation on its basis the external information, logical,

mathematical and physical processes and phenomena?

This problem can be reformulated. If an abstract logician is presented (lets say, Boolean),
on the basis of its algebra of logicians are representable mathematical models therefore phys-
ical models are presented. At the same time are used deﬁnite quantity of logical resources.
The problem arises, it is possible to decide a return problem: to present mathematical and
logical models through physical with restricted quantity?

The example Lp is one, but not the only positive answer on these problems.
To be convinced in it, arithmetic and logic operations universally we represent through
physical quantities and their transformations, (i. e., through characters Lp). Their algorithms
in the language Lp look like arithmetic and logic operations. Their algorithms on the language
Lp look like:

If to put η

provide distributivity of the physical logicians on the basis of Lp. It is possible to deﬁne
them in another way and to receive another logician on Lp, including non distributivity. The
formulas (8) and (9) give an example of physical models, arithmetic and logic operations,
and if the algorithms of calculus to translate into the language Lp, so the calculus will be
physical, and the realizing machine will be the physical computer.

The element base for such machines, i.e. all the ﬁve basic polistors is possible to realize
on the basis of electron-hole plasma, the mathematical model, each of which is possible to
present as a systems from P (model) of diﬀerent bistable subsystems [18]

The outcomes, obtained in activities, and theorems allow to establish not only existence
of many solved problems (10) - (11) for all polistors Lp with properties (4) - (7), but also to
select the solution ensuring a processing compatibility of integral fulﬁllment of polistors in
all ﬁve types.

This purpose for electron-hole plasma (EHP) is reached extremely due to operating

EPPB in it.

Conclusion and discussion

Consideration in the previous section of the elementary models PS-multistable EHP, allows
to conclude, that, apart from other physical quantities, the logical expression is also the
quantitative characteristic of a system condition which is capable to participate in diﬀerent
interplays in it and to be converted. Thus in number with energy, entropy etc. deﬁnite
quantities of the internal latent information and logicians capable partially to be used in
information and computation process inherent in physical systems. In certain conditions
resources latent the logicians can be suﬃcient for construction selfcontained and full, for
the given purpose, physical logical system, most elementary of which one is Lp. Determined
Lp can become the basis for realization of physical calculus and physical computers. More
eﬀective example of physical calculus, are the quantum calculus, marked in section, and
computers, in which one will be used latent indeterminated of the logician for organization
of parallel calculus. The essential diﬀerence Lp and quantum computers is, that the physical
calculus without mathematical and logic operations in a nonclassical logical system is in
case of the former made, and in the second case the mathematical calculus in a classic
logical system with usage of quantum algorithms is made, i.e. the logical fundamentals of
organization of calculus is changed.

The logical properties PS allow to combine these two ways. For Lp this purpose is
possible to reach by several images. Most primitive in this schedule, would be usage of
neuronic calculus in the neuronic architecture, since polistor Lp are physical neurons, as
against programmatic or hardware neurons.

Other capabilities are connected either to the extension Lp up to the quantum logicians,

or with quantum - correlated combination of several Lp.

All these cases are grounded on latent logician and on its physical nature.

The importance of accounting for an ambipolar electrostatic potential or a non-uniform density
proﬁle for modelling of inductively coupled discharges is demonstrated. A drastic enhancement is
observed of the power transfer into plasma for low-collisional, low-pressure, non-local discharges
with non-uniform electron density proﬁles under the condition of bounce resonance. This enhanced
plasma heating is attributed to the increase of the number of resonant electrons, for which the
bounce frequency inside the potential well is equal to the rf ﬁeld frequency.

INTRODUCTION

Low pressure radio-frequency (rf) inductive discharges
have been extensively used over the past decade as
sources of inductively coupled plasmas (ICP) in the
plasma aided material processing industry, semiconduc-
tor manufacturing, and lighting [1, 2]. For very low pres-
sures, i.e. in the milliTorr region the ICP discharges ex-
hibit a strong non-local behavior and a number of pe-
culiar physical eﬀects typical for warm plasmas, like an
anomalous skin penetration and a resonant wave-particle
interaction [3, 4]. The study of these eﬀects leads to fur-
ther optimization of the ICP sources and can result in
improvement of the characteristics of plasma-based de-
vices.

An interesting eﬀect that can lead to enhanced heat-
ing for bounded,
low-pressure plasmas is the possible
bounce resonance between the frequency ω of the driv-
ing rf ﬁeld and the frequency of the bounce motion of
the plasma electrons conﬁned in the potential well by an
ambipolar potential φ(x) and the sheath electric ﬁelds
near the discharge walls [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Most
earlier theoretical and numerical studies on this subject
assumed for simplicity a uniform plasma density over the
discharge length, and the absence of an ambipolar poten-
tial, i.e. allowed the electrons to bounce inside a poten-
tial that is ﬂat inside the plasma and inﬁnite at the walls
[8, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Although these suppositions can result
in a fairly good description of the plasma behavior under
non-resonant conditions, the discharge parameters under
resonant conditions can be greatly altered by account-
ing for the presence of the ambipolar potential, which –
it should be stressed – always exists in real discharges.
It is a very well known result of the quasilinear theory,
that for low-collisional discharges the plasma heating es-
sentially depends on the so-called “resonant electrons,”
or electrons with velocities equal to the phase velocities
v
ω/k of the plane waves constituting the rf ﬁeld (Lan-
dau damping) [6, 7]. For bounded plasmas and for an

≃

electron to be resonant, the above condition transforms
into the requirement that the rf ﬁeld frequency must be
equal to, or be an integer multiple of the bounce electron
frequency ω = nΩb. But the electron bounce frequency is
very sensitive to the actual shape of the ambipolar elec-
trostatic potential φ(x), especially for low-energy elec-
trons. Accounting for the electrostatic potential can lead
the plasma electrons into the resonant region even if they
were not there in the absence of the potential. This can
result into a drastic enhancement of the plasma heating
and other related phenomena [14].

In this article we present the results of a full, self-
consistent numerical modelling of low pressure ICP dis-
charges under the bounce resonance condition and show
the pronounced inﬂuence of the presence of the electro-
static ambipolar potential on the plasma parameters un-
der resonant conditions.

BASIC EQUATIONS

−

The model assumes a one-dimensional, slab geome-
try, inductively coupled discharge of a plasma bounded
on both sides by parallel walls with a gap length L.
The walls carry ﬁxed currents ﬂowing in opposite direc-
tions, produced by an external radio frequency source.
The induced solenoidal rf electric ﬁeld Ey is directed
along the walls and the static ambipolar electric ﬁeld
Ex =
dφ/dx of the ambipolar potential φ(x) is directed
towards the discharge walls, keeping electrons conﬁned
and the plasma quasineutral, i.e. ne(x) = ni(x).
In
the present treatment of high density discharge plasmas
1012 cm−3) the sheath width is neglected, be-
(ne ∼
cause it is of the order of a few hundreds of microns, much
less than the discharge dimension L. Furthermore, it is
assumed that the plasma electrons experience specular
reﬂection: a) from the discharge walls when they have
total energy ε = mv2/2
eφ(x) larger than the elec-
tron potential energy
xw, and
b) from the geometrical location of the turning points

eφ(xw) at the walls,

x±(ε), where
eφ(x±) = ε. The above 1-D scheme can
also be a good approximation for a cylindrical ICP dis-
charge, if the rf ﬁeld penetration depth δ into the plasma
is less than the plasma cylinder radius R [16].

In order to describe the discharge self-consistently, one
needs to determine the rf electric ﬁeld proﬁle Ey(x), the
electron energy distribution function (EEDF) f0(ε), and
the ambipolar potential φ(x). The detailed description of
all the needed formalism is given in [15]. A short account
of the formalism is given below.

Eq. (4) can be eﬀectively solved using a Fourier series
expansion. Introducing the variable angle of the bounce
motion [19] which is proportional to the time of ﬂight

where T is half of the bounce period of the electron mo-
tion in the potential well ϕ(x)

Calculation of the EEDF

For low-pressure discharges, where the energy relax-
ation length is large compared with the plasma width
and the energy relaxation time is large compared with
the rf period, the electron velocity distribution func-
tion (EVDF) can be represented as a sum of the main
isotropic part f = f0(ε) (EEDF) that is a function of only
the total energy ε and of a small alternating anisotropic
part f1(x, v, t), f = f0(ε) + f1(x, v, t) [17, 18, 19]. The

The above described self-consistent system of equa-
tions was formulated in [15], and implemented and com-
pared with the experimental data in [22, 23]. Although
the simulation results of the latter articles were proven
to be adequate, the method of the direct computation of
Green functions, used there, seems to be impractical, be-
cause of the excessively long computational time (about
a day). To speed up the calculations (to about an hour),
the Fast Fourier Transform [Eqs.(26)-(30)] was used in
the present simulations.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Collisionless heating is a very important channel of
power transfer for bounded, warm, low-collisional plas-
mas [4]. For a semi-inﬁnite plasma, the collisionless heat-
ing essentially depends on the resonant electrons, i.e.
electrons moving with the velocities equal to phase ve-
locities of the components of the spectrum of the driv-
ing rf ﬁeld. Such electrons can eﬀectively gain energy
from a wave and, henceforth, the plasma can be eﬃ-
ciently heated under resonant conditions. For the case
of bounded plasma, the condition for resonance heating
transforms into the bounce resonance condition, i.e., the
frequency ω of the electromagnetic wave must coincide,
or to be several times larger of the bounce frequency Ωb
of the electron bounce motion in the potential well. If the
electron mean free path is larger than the discharge gap

L, the resonant electrons with Ωb = ω accumulate veloc-
ity changes in successive interactions with the rf electric
ﬁeld, which lead to very eﬀective electron heating [5].

The importance of the resonant electrons for plasma
heating under the bounce resonance condition, can be
readily examined from expression (21) for the electron
energy diﬀusion coeﬃcient, where the term Ωb(εx)n = ω
in the denominator clearly shows the dominant role of the
resonant electrons for collisionless electron heating. The
total power P deposited into plasma, per unit square of
a side surface, is related to the electron energy diﬀusion
coeﬃcient Dε(ε) [15],

The presence of an ambipolar electrostatic potential
can greatly aﬀect the electron heating due to two reasons:
1) the ambipolar potential conﬁnes low energy elec-
trons to the center of the discharge plasma and these
electrons cannot reach the region of the strong ﬁeld near
the walls, and

2) the number of resonant electrons is generally larger
for a nonuniform plasma than for a uniform plasma due
to inﬂuence of the electrostatic ambipolar potential on
the bounce frequency.

If the ambipolar potential is accounted for, then for low
energy electrons, the distance between turning points is
smaller than the distance between walls L. This results
to an increase of their bounce frequencies compared to

the uniform plasma case. Therefore, if electrons with
low energy were far from the bounce resonance in a uni-
form plasma, they can approach the resonance region in
nonuniform plasma. Fig. 1 shows the dependance of the
electron bounce frequency Ωb(εx) on the electron energy
ε for diﬀerent potential wells, consisting of the reﬂect-
ing walls and diﬀerent ambipolar potentials φ(x). Here,
Ωb(εx) = 2π/Tb(εx), where Tb is half of the bounce period
of the electron motion in the potential well ϕ(x) given by
Eq. (6). The width of the resonance is given by Eq.(21)
and is proportional to ν. The population of resonant elec-
trons consists of all electrons corresponding to the inter-
val of bounce frequencies Ωb(εx)n
ν, ω + ν] where
for most practical cases n = 1 – only the ﬁrst resonance is
important. From Fig. 1 it is apparent that the number of
resonance electrons increases if the ambipolar potential
is accounted for. For example, all electrons conﬁned in
the quadratic potential have the same bounce frequency
and are all resonant, if the bounce frequency is equal to
the discharge frequency. The results of the calculations
described below show that increase of the number of the
resonant electrons has a much more profound eﬀect on
the discharge plasma heating than the mere conﬁnement
of them in the region of low rf ﬁeld.

Non-self-consistent simulations with a given
Maxwellian EEDF and given ambipolar potentials

Most of earlier works on low-pressure ICP discharges
where reported assuming a Maxwellian EEDF, uniform
plasma and accounted for the sheath electric ﬁeld by
bouncing electrons oﬀ the discharge walls [8, 10, 11, 12].
In order to explicitly show the importance of account-
ing for ambipolar potential on collisionless electron heat-
ing, we performed numerical simulations using a given
Maxwellian EEDF for uniform and nonuniform plas-
mas (with and without an ambipolar potential). Specif-
ically, we obtained results for the dependence on the
plasma length of the plasma resistivity or the real part

of impedance Z = 4π/c
E(0)/B(0), where E(0) and
B(0) are the electric and magnetic ﬁeld at the wall, re-
spectively [3]. The surface impedance is related to the
power deposition according to:

P =

I 2ReZ,

(37)

where I is the amplitude of the current.

≫

The results are presented in Fig. 2. It is clearly seen
that the presence of the ambipolar potential enhances sig-
niﬁcantly the resistivity of the plasma under the bounce
resonance condition, compared to the case of the ab-
sence of a potential. The most profound change in re-
sistivity is observed for the quadratic potential. In this
latter case all trapped electrons have the same bounce
frequency, and thus all of them can be resonant. The
obtained results explicitly show that neglecting the am-
bipolar potential, as is often done for simplicity, can lead
to large discrepancies (more than 100 percent), espe-
cially for conditions close to the bounce resonance. For
large gaps L
2πδ = 5 cm (where the skin depth is
δ = 0.79 cm for the conditions in Fig. 2), the two skin
layers near both walls are independent of each other, as
the gap width is much larger than the nonlocality length
l = VT /ω = 1.55 cm. As a result, for L > 5 cm the
surface impedance does not depend on the gap width.
In the opposite limit L
2δ, the electric ﬁeld proﬁle
≪
is linear Ey = Ey(0)(1
2x/L) and the plasma resistiv-
ity is mostly determined by the ﬁrst bounce resonance
ω = Ωb. For uniform plasmas, only slow electrons con-
tribute to the collisionless heating, because the resonant
velocity corresponds to vx = ωL/π = VT L/πl << VT . If
2δ the number of resonant electrons and the total
L
number of electrons in plasma are decreasing for smaller
L, which leads to a smaller heating. For nonuniform plas-
mas, the bounce resonance condition ω = Ωb can not be
satisﬁed for any electron energy for small L < 2 cm and
collisionless heating vanishes, see Fig. 2.

The maximum of plasma resistivity occurs at L

2δ.
Similarly to the case of short gaps, the real part of the
surface impedance is mostly due to the ﬁrst bounce reso-
nance ω = Ωb, and only slow electrons contribute to col-

lisionless heating for uniform plasma, as vx ∼
VT 2δ/πl < VT . For nonuniform plasmas, the bounce
frequency is higher than in uniform plasmas and most
of electrons are in resonance. As a result the surface
resonance plotted as a function of the gap width has a
pronounced peak compared to the shallow maximum in
uniform plasmas, see Fig. 2.

To compare the condition of the bounce resonance
ω = Ωb with the corresponding condition of the tran-
sit resonance ω = VT k, additional simulations of the
dependance of the plasma resistivity ReZ on the driv-
ing frequency ω were performed for the ﬁxed length

counting for the electrostatic potential). In Fig. 3(a) the
resistivity is shown as a function of the discharge fre-
quency normalized by the inverse of the “transit” time
of the electron pass through the skin layer VT /δmax,
where δmax is the plasma penetration depth of the rf

At high plasma densities (> 1010cm−3) the ﬁeld pene-
tration depth is much smaller than the discharge gap L
and the eﬀects of the ﬁnite discharge gap are unimpor-
tant: the maximum of the surface impedance and, corre-
spondingly, the most eﬃcient collisionless electron heat-

ties (and frequencies) (ne < 1010 cm−3) the electric ﬁeld
penetration depth is of the order of the discharge dimen-
L, and as a result the maximum of the surface

impedance corresponds to the condition of the bounce
resonance ω

of the power dissipation occurs when both conditions for
the bounce and transit resonances are met, which occurs

the number of resonant electrons is exponentially small
and collisionless heating vanishes. The resulting heating
depends on the collision frequency and nonlocal eﬀects,

Accounting for the ambipolar potential enhances con-
siderably the plasma resistivity for the aforementioned
case. As shown in Fig. 4, the pronounced maxima of
ReZ appear for the frequencies that correspond to inte-
ger multiples of the bounce frequency ω = nΩbT , because
accounting for the electrostatic potential yields a larger
number of the resonant electrons.

Self-consistent calculations

To investigate the behavior of discharge parameters
under the condition of a bounce resonance, the full self-
consistent simulations of the EEDF, rf electric ﬁeld, and
ambipolar potential for ﬁxed surface current have been
performed for 13.56 MHz rf driving frequency. Figure
5 shows the dependence of the resistivity of the dis-
charge plasma on the discharge dimension. The calcula-
tions have been performed for discharge gaps from 3 cm
to 10 cm (the discharge can not be sustained for gaps
smaller then 3 cm at a given pressure of 3 mTorr).
It
can be clearly seen that the resistivity of the plasma
sharply increases for the discharge gap corresponding to
the bounce resonance (about 3 cm). The self-consistent
electrostatic potential and ion-electron density proﬁles
are plotted in Fig. 6(a) for two diﬀerent discharge lengths
- 3 cm, corresponding to the bounce resonance condition,

and 10 cm, corresponding to the non-resonant width.
These graphs show that the electron density at the center
of the discharge is larger for the 3 cm resonant gap than
for the 10 cm non-resonant gap. Note that if the power
transfer eﬃciency, or the surface impedance, were the
same, then the total power transferred into the plasma
would also be the same and the plasma densities would
be equal, due to energy balance. In our case the surface
impedance for 3 cm gap is considerably higher, what cor-
responds to the higher plasma density.

The electron energy distribution function and the dif-
fusion coeﬃcient in energy space are shown in Fig. 6(b).
Figure 6(b) shows that the energy diﬀusion coeﬃcient
is larger for the 3 cm gap than for the 10 cm gap for
electron energy less than 15 eV. This results in more
eﬀective electron heating, leading to the larger plasma
resistivity shown in Fig. 5. The steady-state electron
energy distribution function is governed by the follow-
ing processes: the collisionless electron heating in the rf
electric ﬁeld, inelastic collisions with neutrals, and re-
distribution of energy among plasma electrons due to
electron-electron collisions. We see in Fig. 6(b) that the
EEDF shape is similar to the two-temperature EEDF
[4] with the temperature of the tail of the distribution
being lower than the temperature of the main body of
the EEDF, corresponding to the onset of inelastic col-
lisional losses. For a 3 cm gap, corresponding to the
bounce resonance condition, the electron temperature of
low-energy electrons (less than the excitation potential
11.5 eV) is much higher than for the 10 cm non-resonant
gap. This eﬀect is similar to the plateau formation on
the EEDF governed by collisionless heating in the ﬁnite

range of electron energies [6]. Under the conditions of
Fig. 6 this plateau is not well pronounced, because it is
smeared out by electron-electron collisions. Additional
simulations have been performed also for the discharge
frequency 6.78 MHz, which is half the driving rf ﬁeld
frequency considered above. For the lower driving fre-
quency the ﬁrst bounce resonance shifts in the region of
larger L, as shown in Fig. 7. Figure 7 shows the calcu-
lated resistivity for two diﬀerent surface currents, 1 A/cm
and 5 A/cm. One can see that the positions of the re-
sistivity maxima corresponding to diﬀerent surface cur-
rents are shifted relatively to each other. The larger sur-
face current corresponds to a larger power transfer into
the plasma according to Eq.(37) and results in a higher
1011,
plasma density (n
respectively). The higher discharge plasma density, in
turn, leads to a smaller skin depth. Correspondingly, the
position of resistivity maximum shifts into the region of
smaller discharge gaps of the order of the skin depth. The
electron energy distribution functions for 6.78 MHz are
plotted in Fig. 8 for the surface current 1 A/m and for
two diﬀerent lengths, resonant 9 cm and non-resonant
15 cm. The phenomenon of plateau-formation on the
EEDF is clearly seen for the bounce resonance condition
for L = 9 cm.

The analysis of the properties of

inductively cou-

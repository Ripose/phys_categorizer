A system of N particles ξN = (x1, v1, ..., xN , vN ) interacting self-

consistently with M waves Zn = An exp(iφn) is considered. Given ini-

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent work on the dynamics of wave-particle interaction has led to extensive use of N-

body hamiltonian models in parallel with the more traditional kinetic approach. The present

paper aims at discussing to what extent the two approaches agree in the limit N

→ ∞
where N-body dynamics formally reduces to kinetic theory. This is a classical problem of

,

statistical physics, notoriously unsolved for particles interacting through short-range forces,

where it amounts to deriving the Boltzmann equation from the Liouville equation : sys-

tematic rigorous derivations of the kinetic equation from BBGKY hierarchy are still lacking

– notwithstanding the pioneering work of Lanford and King, limited to short timescales

[19,20], and recent advances [7,25]. However, for long-range forces, and more precisely for

smooth enough mean-ﬁeld interactions, the formal limit N

commutes with the dynam-

→ ∞

ics [22,26]. We show in this paper how the mean-ﬁeld methods apply also to wave-particle

interactions.

A physical motivation for this work is that wave-particle interacting systems are typical

of plasmas and common to many physical phenomena. The paradigm of such interactions is

provided by the self-consistent hamiltonian H N,M

describing the evolution of N particles and

sc

M Langmuir waves [1–3,5,8–10,16,21,23,24,27,28]. In particular this hamiltonian enables a

mechanical approach of classical plasma problems like Landau damping and beam-plasma

instability, by treating Langmuir waves as M harmonic oscillators self-consistently coupled

to N quasiresonant beam particles. For simplicity we present our results in one space

dimension with periodic boundary conditions, which conforms to the physical conditions

considered in models of plasmas [4,12,15].

The basic characteristic of such models is that particles do not interact directly with

each other : they only interact with the modes ; symmetrically, the modes do not interact

directly with each other : they only interact directly with the particles. Inasmuch the modes

are spatial Fourier components of some ﬁelds, these components are not localized spatially :

this invites to describe the many-body limit N

as a mean-ﬁeld limit and enables us

→ ∞

3

to apply the techniques which succeed in the case of particle-particle mean-ﬁeld coupling.

The present work takes advantage of this observation to show that the kinetic limit

N

→ ∞

and the time evolution over any time interval [0, T ] commute. Our result implies

that numerical simulations with increasing number of particles behave ever closer to the

predictions of kinetic theory (if one uses N ‘large enough’...).

A preliminary form of our result was annouced in reference [14]. In Sec. II we describe

the model and its evolution equations. The main results are stated in Sec. III. Sec. IV is

devoted mainly to a ﬁnite N estimate and a technical remark, preparing the proof presented

in Sec. V. The ﬁnal section is devoted to the conclusion.

II. SELF-CONSISTENT HAMILTONIAN AND KINETIC LIMIT

We consider a system of N particles with respectively mass mr, charge qr, position xr

and momentum pr, interacting with M waves with respectively natural frequency ωj0, phase

θj and intensity Ij. The evolution of this system is described by the hamiltonian

where the ﬁrst term corresponds to free particles, the second term to free waves (harmonic

oscillators) and the third term to their coupling. The coupling constants are expressed in

such a way to ease the kinetic limit N

: we shall keep the ‘wave susceptibilities’ βj

→ ∞

constant in this limit. A simple change of variables enables one to ensure that all coeﬃcients

βj > 0, which is assumed in the following. The overall coupling factor ε in the interaction

term of (1) emphasizes our interest in the weak-coupling regime (ε

1) [2,11].

≪

Assuming periodic boundary conditions, the particles move on (IR/L) = SL and the

wavenumbers are quantized (kj = nj2π/L for some integer nj). The phase space of this

system is thus (SL ×

extensive (i.e. O(N)), and the coupling constant scales as ε = O(N −

1/2). The extensivity of

wave intensities can easily be interpreted as, in the physical regime of the model, we expect

particles to be mostly resonant with the waves, each such particle contributing then to wave

intensities by evolving in their potential well. This prompts us to introduce intensive wave

V. PROOF OF THE MAIN RESULT

The proof of theorem 1 uses the fact that the two types of degrees of freedom have no

‘self’-interaction.

Indeed the motion of particle r is completely determined by its initial

position and velocity and by the modes history, i.e. the data of the modes aj(.) over a time

interval [s, t] deﬁnes the vector ﬁeld G so that:

(xr(t), vr(t)) = G[a(t)](xr(t), vr(t))

(38)

This vector ﬁeld is Lipschitz-continuous on Λ according to (35) and subsequent remarks.

Thus Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem ensures the existence and unicity of the ﬂow T :

By duality the measure µs on Λ is transported by the ﬂow to

µt = µs ◦

Ts,t[a(.)]

Similarly, the evolution of mode j is also completely determined by its initial data aj(s) and

by the history of the measure on particle phase space Λ in the right hand side of (17) which

deﬁnes a ﬂow S by

aj(t) = St,s[µ.]aj(s)

(41)

Solving kinetic equations (16)-(17) with initial data (µ0, a(0)) amounts to ﬁnding a ﬁxed

point of the coupled system (40)-(41) in the space (

which is bounded by a function of h0 as discussed in Section IV. This completes the proof

of the theorem.

The corollary follows in a standard way.

Remark : our estimate for the growth rate C in the kinetic case is larger than the ﬁnite-N

estimate for

in phase space. This is due to the fact that the distance dbL makes no

|M|

distinction between x-components and v-components, while estimates of Sec. IV relied on

treating these components of the phase space points separately to obtain (30).

VI. CONCLUSION

This work supports theoretically the use of full N-body dynamical schemes [5,6,11,16–18]

to study the wave-particle interactions, as an alternative to kinetic-theory based models.

However the regularity of the limit N

is tempered by the rapid growth of the right

→ ∞

hand side in the upper bound (23).

It also identiﬁes the fundamental cause of phase space mixing and approach to equi-

librium in this many-body system : particles passing near the instantaneous saddle points

associated with the modes undergo exponential dichotomy, with a divergence rate controlled

14

by amplitudes

. This implies that the phase space regions where discrepancies be-

tween the kinetic description and the ﬁnite-N description show up most rapidly correspond

to the neighbourhood of the ‘separatrices’ associated with the envelopes in the particles’

µ-space Λ, as was observed in numerical simulations for M = 1 by Guyomarc’h [17,18].

Test ion acceleration in the ﬁeld of expanding planar electron cloud

M.M. Basko∗
Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics, Moscow, Russian Federation

New exact results are obtained for relativistic acceleration of test positive ions in the laminar
zone of a planar electron sheath evolving from an initially mono-energetic electron distribution.
The electron dynamics is analyzed against the background of motionless foil ions. The limiting
gamma-factor γp∞ of accelerated ions is shown to be determined primarily by the values of the ion-
electron charge-over-mass ratio µ = meZp/mp and the initial gamma-factor γ0 of the accelerated
electrons. For µ > 1
8 a test ion always overtakes the electron front and attains γp∞ > γ0. For
µ < 1
8 a test ion can catch up with the electron front only when γ0 is above a certain critical
value γcr, which for µ ≪ 1 can most often be evaluated as γcr = 1
. In reality the
protons and heavier test ions, for which γcr > 10398 is enormous, always lag behind the front edge
of the electron sheath and have γp∞ < γ0; for their maximum energy an appropriate intermediate
asymptotic formula is derived. The domain of applicability of the laminar-zone results is analyzed
in detail.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most impressive latest achievements in
laser-plasma interaction has been the observation of well-
collimated high-energy proton and ion beams produced
from thin metallic foils irradiated by ultra-intense sub-
picosecond laser pulses [1, 2, 3, 4]. An exceptional
quality, demonstrated recently for thus produced proton
beams [5], makes them very promising for many potential
applications [6].

In its gross features, the mechanism of ion acceleration
in the cited and other similar experiments is believed to
be reasonably well understood, and has been nicknamed
TNSA (target normal sheath acceleration) [7, 8]. High
directionality and low phase volume of generated protons
[5] indicate that they are accelerated in a highly ordered
electric ﬁeld normal to the virtually unperturbed planar
rear surface of the laser-irradiated foil. The electric ﬁeld
is caused by charge separation in the sheath layer that is
formed by energetic electrons generated by absorption of
the laser pulse.

However, an attempt to provide a more detailed and
comprehensive theoretical description leads to a very
complex system of plasma dynamics equations that can
hardly be ever solved rigorously. To establish practically
useful dependences and relations, one has to introduce
additional simpliﬁcations. As is typical in other areas of
physics, of particular value for gaining a deeper under-
standing of the process of ion acceleration prove to be cer-
tain particular idealized but exactly solvable problems.
Salient and well known examples are (i) a self-similar evo-
lution of the ion distribution function by quasi-neutral
plasma expansion into vacuum [9], and (ii) a virtually
exact two-ﬂuid solution of the isothermal plasma expan-
sion with a full account of charge separation eﬀects [10].

∗Electronic address: basko@itep.ru

In this paper we present a rigorous solution and a full
parametric analysis of another such idealized problem,
namely, the problem of test ion acceleration in a dynamic
sheath of relativistic electrons with the delta-function ini-
tial velocity distribution.

Typically, fast protons in laser irradiated metallic foils
originate from a thin (few nanometers) contaminant layer
of water and hydrocarbons at the foil surface [3, 4, 11].
Then, a natural simpliﬁcation would be to assume that
the heavy bulk ions (like Au for example) of a metal-
lic foil are inﬁnitely heavy and stay at rest, while the
accelerated protons are treated as test positive charges
initially located at the foil surface. Our present solution
is essentially based on this assumption.

Next, one has to choose how to treat the electrons.
A widely used assumption is that the electrons instan-
taneously relax to the equilibrium Boltzmann distri-
bution in the time-dependent electrostatic potential of
the expanding plasma:
it was employed in both solu-
tions [9, 10] cited above. With immobile ions, such
an assumption allows straightforward calculation of the
electrostatic sheath potential φ(x) either in the one-
temperature [12] or multi-temperature [13] cases. An
obvious problem with this approximation is that it leads
to a diverging result for the maximum energy of ac-
celerated test ions because the corresponding potential
1 + x/(√2λD)
φ(x) =
[12] logarithmically
diverges at x
in the planar geometry; here λD

(cid:3)
∞
is the Debye length at the base of the electron sheath
with temperature T , +e is the elementary charge. How-
ever, as was pointed out by Gurevich et al.
[9], this
divergence is not physical because even if one assumes
that the hot electrons have a perfect Maxwellian distri-
bution initially, at t = 0, it still takes an increasingly
long time ∆t
x for the Boltzmann relation
exp(eφ/T ) to establish at an increasingly large dis-
ne ∝
tance x from the initial plasma surface (for more details
see section III B 2 below). As possible remedies, attempts
have been made to use ad hoc quasi-equilibrium electron

distributions truncated either at high velocities [14, 15]
or at large distances [16]. Evidently, neither of these two
approaches is fully self-consistent.

Without the Boltzmann relation, a self-consistent
treatment requires that one starts with a given initial
electron distribution function at t = 0, and then calcu-
lates its evolution for t > 0. For high-energy (multi-MeV)
electrons this can be done in the collisionless approxi-
mation. In this work we solve this problem in the sim-
plest case of initially monoenergetic electrons, i.e. when
at t = 0 all the free electrons of a uniform planar foil have
one and the same initial velocity v0 perpendicular to the
foil. Rigorous results are obtained for test ion accelera-
tion in the outer laminar zone (for strict deﬁnition see
section III A below) of the dynamically evolving electron
sheath. Particular attention is paid to the limiting en-
ergy of accelerated ions at t
, which is always ﬁnite
within the adopted model.

formulated problem:
upon earlier work by Bulanov et al.
[17]. The new
progress made here includes the following key issues.
Temporal behavior of the boundary between the outer
laminar and the inner relaxation zones of the dynami-
cally evolving electron sheath is studied in detail. Con-
sequently, the domain of applicability of the laminar-zone
results for test ions is clearly identiﬁed in the full parame-
ter space of the problem. In contrast to Ref. [17], the elec-
tric ﬁeld in the laminar zone is calculated exactly and not
to the accuracy of the linear in x term. It is proven that
the answer to the intriguing question of whether a test
ion can overtake the electron front (and, consequently,
surpass the initial electron velocity v0) is determined by
a critical relationship between the initial gamma-factor
γ0 of accelerated electrons and the ion-electron charge-
over-mass ratio µ [deﬁned in Eq. (1) below]. A fully rel-
ativistic intermediate asymptotic formula (58) is derived
which may be used in realistic situations to evaluate the
maximum energy of accelerated protons and heavier ions.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

Consider a uniform electrically neutral plasma foil of
thickness l0 with an initial density of free electrons n0.
At time t = 0 all the free electrons are set in motion with
the same initial velocity v0 perpendicular to the foil (see
Fig. 1); v0 can be arbitrarily close to the speed of light
c. At later times t > 0 the motion of electrons, treated
as a collisionless charged ﬂuid, is governed by the electric
ﬁeld E(t, x), which arises due to charge separation in the
evolving plasma cloud. The origin of the x-axis, directed
along the initial electron velocity ~v0, is chosen at the
forward foil surface, so that initially the foil occupies the
0. The bulk foil ions are assumed to
region
be inﬁnitely heavy and staying at rest. Our goal is to
calculate the motion of a test ion of charge +eZp and
mass mp placed initially at the foil surface x = 0, which

l0 ≤

is accelerated by the electric ﬁeld E(t, x) in the positive
direction of the x axis. Note that here and below mp is
not necessarily the proton mass.

For a non-thermal electron cloud considered here the

Then, the parameter Λ is the initial foil thickness in units

eﬀects of charge separation are the strongest in this limit

III. MOTION OF ELECTRONS

A. General notation and relationships

Motion of electrons is described by a function xe(t, l)
[or by a function xe(t, ξ)], where l (or ξ) is a Lagrangian
coordinate in the electron ﬂuid: xe(t, l) is the position
at time t of an electron whose original position at t =
l (the broken line in Fig. 1). The

(4)

Then, the front edge of the electron cloud is at ξ = 0, its
rear edge is at ξ = 1.

At any ﬁxed time t one can invert xe(t, ξ) with respect
to ξ to obtain the inverse function ξ = ξ(t, x) deﬁned
inside the expanding electron cloud. Without electron-
electron collisions the function ξ(t, x) ceases to be single-
valued with respect to x after some time — even if it
were so initially. In this paper we use the term “laminar
zone” for that region of the electron cloud where ξ(t, x)
is single-valued (see Figs. 2 and 3 below).
In the re-
maining “relaxation zone”, where ξ(t, x) is multi-valued,
electrons gradually relax to the equilibrium Boltzmann
distribution.

The function xe(t, ξ) is found by solving the following

Calculation of σe(t, x) depends on whether x happens to
be in the laminar or relaxation zone of the electron cloud.
In the laminar zone one simply has σe(t, x) = ξ(t, x), and
equations of motion (5) can be solved analytically.

In the relaxation zone, where the function ξ(t, x) be-
comes multi-valued with respect to x, one has to use a
more general expression

σe(t, x) =

∆ξ,

(10)

Xxe(t,ξ)>x

where summation is done over all the segments ∆ξ which
at time t are located inside the interval (x, +
). Clearly,
if Eqs. (5) are to be solved with a full account of the re-
laxation zone, it can only be done numerically. To this
end, a numerical code TIAC (test ion acceleration) has
been written, which calculates the electron motion and
the ensuing electric ﬁeld E(t, x) with a full account of
possible mutual interpenetration of diﬀerent elements of
the electron ﬂuid. Because of rapid randomization (for
details see subsection III B 2) of the electron motion at
the core of the relaxation zone, such straightforward cal-
culations can only be realized within a limited time span
of the order of 100 periods of electron oscillations near
the foil surface.

B. Solution for Λ = 0

Here we consider the limit l0 →

0 of a geometrically
very thin foil with a ﬁnite value of electron number per
unit area Σ = n0l0, where both the initial electron den-
sity n0 and the plasma frequency ω0 become formally
inﬁnite.
In this case it is convenient to introduce the
following units of time and length

[t] = tΣ ≡

mev0
4πe2Σ

γ0,

[x] = lΣ ≡

v0tΣ,

(11)

which replace the usual time and length scales √γ0/ω0,
v0√γ0/ω0 in a ﬁnite-density plasma. Evidently, the
length unit lΣ plays a role of the Debye length in our dy-
namic electron sheath. Below, the quantities measured in
units (11) are marked with a bar. The electron trajecto-
ries are represented by a two-parameter family of curves
¯xe(¯t, ξ, β0).

particular, for any 0 < β0 < 1 the rear edge of the elec-
tron cloud ξ = 1 turns around (i.e. has Πe = 0) at ¯t = 1,
and later crosses the foil at ¯t = 2 with Πe =

grangian coordinate ξ in the relaxation zone (shaded area).
The number of local minima and maxima along ξ rapidly (ex-
ponentially) increases with time.

Numerical solution of Eqs. (5) enables one to trace the
onset and subsequent expansion of the relaxation zone,
shown in Figs. 2 and 3 as shaded areas. In this zone os-
cillations of electrons around the positively charged foil,
occurring on a time scale tΣ, rapidly become stochas-
tic and ultimately lead to establishment of the Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution with a certain temperature that
can be found from the energy integral (6). The starting
point of the relaxation zone can be calculated analytically
by applying the conditions ∂ ¯xe/∂ξ = 0, ∂2 ¯xe/∂ξ2 = 0 to
Eq. (13b); in the non-relativistic limit it has the coordi-

universal function of two variables ¯t and ξ. It is plotted

cal behavior. Once the electron trajectories in the central
region begin to intersect one another in the process of os-
cillations across the ion layer (see Fig. 2), their further
motion becomes increasingly stochastic. As a result, an
isothermal quasi-equilibrium core gradually develops in-
side the relaxation zone, where the electron density obeys
the Boltzmann relation ne(x)
exp (eφ/T ); here φ(x) is
the equilibrium electrostatic potential, and T is the tem-
perature of the quasi-equilibrium core. This qualitative
picture is fully conﬁrmed by the results of direct simula-
tions with the TIAC code presented in Fig. 4.

To assess practical applicability of our results for test
ion acceleration in the laminar zone, obtained below, one
needs to know how the boundary xr(t) between the relax-
ation and the laminar zones evolves in time. We analyze
this evolution by combining an analytical estimate in the
limit of t
with the TIAC simulations for times
¯t <

∼
Since randomization of the electron motion in the re-
laxation zone leads to establishment of the Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution, we can invoke the following ar-
gument to evaluate the width ¯xr of this zone at times
¯t
1: by a time ¯t the relaxation zone spreads to a
distance ¯xr such that ¯t = Nr ¯teq(¯xr), where Nr is a nu-
merical factor of the order unity, and ¯teq(¯xr) is the travel
time between ¯x = 0 and ¯x = ¯xr in the equilibrium po-
tential (17) of an electron whose kinetic energy vanishes
at ¯x = ¯xr. In a sense, teq(xr) is a timescale on which
the information about maxwellization of the velocity dis-
tribution up to a certain limiting value vr is transferred
from x = 0 to the corresponding limiting distance xr in
the inﬁnite potential well (17). This argument sounds
perfectly reasonable for the quasi-equilibrium core, and
may be surmised to apply to the entire relaxation zone
as well.

The fraction of the electron cloud occupied by the up-
per laminar zone is given by the diﬀerence 1
χr/η0 [in
the ultra-relativistic case the separation along the hy-
perbolic variable χ = arctanh(x/ct) is physically more
representative than the separation along x], where η0 =
arccosh γ0 = arcsinh Π0. If χr(¯t) should reach the value
η0, it would mean that the relaxation zone has reached
the electron front ¯x = ¯t and the laminar zone has van-
ished. One clearly sees that typically the electron cloud
is not dominated by the relaxation zone, whose frac-
tion asymptotically approaches some constant value, and
which has a tendency to shrink with the increasing γ0.
For γ0 = 1 this fraction is αr = 0.25
0.02. Therefore,
it can be expected that there exists a sizable window
in the parameter space where the test ion acceleration
takes place either entirely or predominantly in the lami-
nar zone.

1. Electron trajectories

For subsequent analysis of the test ion motion we need

However, because for Λ > 0 each such trajectory ˜xe(˜t, ˜l)
starts inside the foil at

one needs the function ˜l(˜t, ˜x, β0), which is the inverse of
˜xe(˜t, ˜l, β0) with respect to ˜l. When calculating the results
discussed in section IV B, such inversion of Eqs. (30)-(35)
was performed numerically.

Since the Lagrangian coordinate ˜l belongs to the in-
terval 0
Λ, a vacuum gap is formed between the
ejected electrons and the ion layer in the case of Λ < h0
for a limited time after the rear electron edge ˜l = Λ
reaches the foil surface at x = 0 — similar to the case of
Λ = 0 (see Fig. 2) where such a gap exists at 0 < ¯t < 2.
Throughout the gap, the electric ﬁeld E is constant and
˜l = Λ. To avoid unnecessary technical complications, we
exclude the interval 0 < Λ < h0 < √2 from our consid-
eration, i.e. we perform all the calculations either for the
limiting case of Λ = 0, or for Λ > h0 when no gap ap-
pears between the ejected electrons and the foil ions. The
reward is that we get rid of the dependence of ˜l on the
parameter Λ, i.e. ˜l(˜t, ˜x, β0) is a smooth function of ˜t and
˜x for all ˜t
˜t, and this function does not
depend on Λ. In particular, this leads us to an important
conclusion that the behavior of the electron trajectories
(hence, the distribution of any other physical quantity)
in the laminar zone of the electron cloud at ˜x > 0 does
not depend on the parameter Λ for Λ > h0.

an upper bound (37) valid at all times t <

only been able to verify it numerically with the TIAC
code within a limited range of Λ <

In the previous subsection it was established that the
electron trajectories in the laminar zone do not depend
on Λ for Λ > h0. This, however, does not mean that
the same should apply to the boundary between the
relaxation and the laminar zones because this bound-
ary is determined by electrons traversing the relaxation
zone. Nevertheless, one might expect that the curve χr(˜t)

the initial values xp(tp0) = Πp(tp0) = 0. Then, because
the electric ﬁeld E(t, x) is non-negative for all x
0, we
are guaranteed that xp(t) > 0 for all t > 0. Equations
(38) bring in a dimensionless parameter µ = meZp/mp,
which contains all the necessary information about the
test ion.

≥

A. Solution for Λ = 0

Here, as in section III B, we use the units (11) and
mark thus normalized quantities with a bar. The accel-
erating electric ﬁeld E(¯t, ¯x) in the laminar zone is given
by Eq. (14).

1. Vacuum phase

When Λ = 0, a test ion begins its motion by pass-
ing through a vacuum gap, where it is accelerated by a
constant ﬁeld E = 4πeΣ, until its trajectory

¯x = ¯xp1 = ¯xp,vac(¯tp1)

(40)

with a momentum Πp1 = µΠ0¯tp1. The latter values
should be used as the initial conditions for further ac-
celeration inside the electron cloud.

2. Non-relativistic solution

In the non-relativistic limit a general analytical solu-
tion is easily found to Eqs. (38). The type of this solution
depends on whether the roots λ and 1
λ of the charac-
teristic equation

λ2

are real or complex. In this way a critical value µ∗ = 1
8
of the parameter µ is established, which separates the
two solution types. For µ > 1
8 , when λ is complex, a
test ion always catches up with the electron front ¯x = ¯t
and acquires the ﬁnal velocity vp∞ in excess of the initial
electron velocity v0.

In the physically more interesting case of µ < 1

ciently heavy test ion) the sought for solution of Eqs. (38)
is given by

Solution (42) reveals the following general features
of ion acceleration in the laminar zone. The distance
¯xp(¯t) between the electron front and the acceler-

ion with µ < 1

the relaxation zone. Ions with µ
ated deep in the relaxation zone, where one can use the
Boltzmann relation and the quasi-static potential (17);
one readily veriﬁes that the potential (17) leads to much
higher (by roughly a factor µ−1) ﬁnal ion energies than
those obtained from Eq. (45). From this we conclude that
the acceleration in the near-front laminar zone of a non-
relativistic electron cloud is never important for protons
and heavier test ions.
In section IV B we demonstrate
that this conclusion, proved here for Λ = 0, is valid for
Λ > 1 as well.

lyzed by inspecting the integral curves of the ﬁrst-order
phase equation

in the (χ, η) plane. Of principal importance here is the
singular point (χ, η) = (η0, η0).

≥

First of all note that physically meaningful in our con-
text are the integral curves of Eq. (48) that lie in the
half-plane η > χ: this follows from inequality xp(t) < vpt
valid for any motion with xp(0)
0 and a monotonically
increasing velocity vp(t). The electron front x = v0t is
represented by the vertical line χ = η0. A test ion can
cross the electron front either in a regular way at η > η0,
or by passing through the singular point (η0, η0) along
one of the two characteristic directions deﬁned by the
characteristic equation (41) (see Fig. 7). A remarkable
fact is that the roots of Eq. (41) do not depend on η0,
i.e. are the same for the relativistic and non-relativistic
motions. As a consequence, we obtain a universal critical
value µ∗ = 1
8 which separates two topologically diﬀerent
patterns of the ion trajectories near the singular point
(η0, η0).

For light ions with µ > 1

8 , when the singular point
(η0, η0) is a focus (see Fig. 7a), the qualitative picture
is the same as in the non-relativistic case: a test ion
always reaches the electron front χ = η0 within a ﬁnite
time interval and crosses it at η > η0, i.e. with a velocity
vp = vp∞ > v0.

line η = χ at a certain value η
ηcr00
(see Fig. 8), where ηcr00 = ηcr00(µ) is a function of µ.
As a consequence, for a given µ and η0 > ηcr00(µ) the
phase trajectory of a test ion may pass above the sep-
aratrix and fall into the second class. In such a case a
test ion overtakes the electron front within a ﬁnite time
interval. To reach more deﬁnite conclusions, we have to
take a closer look at the initial conditions.

If a test ion begins to move simultaneously with elec-

section with the separatrix S deﬁnes the primary critical
value ηcr0 = ηcr0(µ) for this parameter. Its meaning is as
follows: for any η0 > ηcr0(µ) a test ion with the charge-
over-mass ratio µ ﬁnally catches up with the electron
front and overtakes it.

The fact that the vacuum segments of the phase trajec-
tories in Fig. 8 rise less steeply than the initial portions
of the relativistic integral curves of Eq. (48) implies that
a delayed (at tp0 > 0) start of a test ion may result in
its more eﬃcient acceleration. In reality such a delayed
start may occur when a test positive particle is created
on the spot some time after the laser pulse. If we con-
sider a delayed start at ¯tp0 ≥
2, when the vacuum gap
is already closed (the opposite extreme to the previously
considered case of simultaneous start at tp0 = 0), the
locus of the initial points (χ, η) = (0, 0) for the integral
curves of Eq. (48) in the (χ

B. Solution for Λ > h0

From practical point of view the case of Λ >

1 is gener-
ally more important than the limit Λ = 0 considered so
far. As a typical example, it may be noted that a 1 µm
foil of solid gold ionized to z = 50 with γ0 = 100 would
correspond to Λ
10. Here we prove that practically all
the qualitative and many of the quantitative results ob-
tained for Λ = 0 extend to the case of Λ > 0 as well. To
avoid unnecessary mathematical complications, we ex-
clude from our consideration the intermediate range of
0 < Λ < h0 and assume that Λ > h0 = [2γ0/(1 + γ0)]1/2.

In the case of a simultaneous ion start at tp0 = 0 we have

concerning test ion acceleration in the laminar zone are
independent of Λ for Λ > h0.

The next important point is that in the limit of ˜t

equations (60) become exactly equivalent to the corre-
sponding equations of motion for ¯xp(¯t), Πp(¯t) in the case
of Λ = 0. To verify this, we note that Eqs. (30)-(35)

in section IV A, which are then reduced to the same phase
equation (48) with the same topology of integral curves
in the vicinity of the singular point (χ, η) = (η0, η0). As
a consequence, we arrive at conclusions that are fully
analogous to those made for the case of Λ = 0:

(i) test ions with µ > µ∗ = 1

8 always catch up and over-
take the electron front, being ﬁnally accelerated to
Πp∞ > Π0;

(ii) for any µ < 1

8 there exists a critical value ηcrΛ(µ)
of parameter η0 [or, equivalently, a critical value
γcrΛ(µ) of parameter γ0] such that only for η0 >
ηcrΛ(µ) [i.e. for γ0 > γcrΛ(µ)] can a test ion with the
charge-over-mass ratio µ overtake the electron front
and be accelerated to Πp∞ > Π0; for η0 < ηcrΛ(µ)
a test ion lags behind the electron front while its
dimensionless momentum Πp(˜t) asymptotically ap-
proaches Π0 on a timescale ˜tac ≃

2 µ−1

exp

.
(cid:1)

(cid:0)

These conclusions are fully conﬁrmed by numerical in-
tegration of Eqs. (60) with ˜l(˜t, ˜x, β0) calculated from
Eqs. (30)-(35).

A remarkable fact is that we have two universal func-
tions, namely, ηcr0(µ) for Λ = 0, and ηcrΛ(µ) for Λ > h0,
which cover the entire range of Λ variation. Since at
intermediate times ˜t
1 the two cases of Λ = 0 and
Λ > h0 are mathematically not equivalent, the functions
ηcr0(µ) and ηcrΛ(µ) numerically diﬀer from one another,
except for the initial point ηcr0(µ∗) = ηcrΛ(µ∗) = 0. This
diﬀerence, however, is practically not signiﬁcant, as one
veriﬁes by comparing the numerically calculated values
1
of ηcr0(µ) and ηcrΛ(µ) in Table I. In the limit of µ
one derives an asymptotic expression

≪

≃

12

which is exactly one half of the corresponding limit (53)
for γcr0. One can safely conjecture that for intermediate
values 0 < Λ < h0 the corresponding critical values of
γ0 lie between γcr0(µ) and γcrΛ(µ). For γ0 > γcrΛ(µ),
when a test ion does overtake the electron front, its ﬁnal
energy in the limit of µ

FIG. 9: Comparison of the intermediate asymptotics (58)
with the results of numerical integration of the ion equations

plotted is the ratio of the ion momentum Πpap(t), obtained
from Eqs. (58) and (66), to the numerically calculated value
Πp(t) versus time t in units (25).

Under the approximation (63) one derives the same
intermediate asymptotics (58) for the test ion momentum
Πp(t) as in the case of Λ = 0. The only diﬀerence between
the two cases is in the initial values of tp1 and Πp1 =
Πp(tp1) to be used in Eq. (58). Unlike in the Λ = 0
case, no appropriate analytical solution to Eqs. (60) was

the critical value of the η0 parameter for ˜tp0 ≫
1 should
be given by the function ηcr00(µ). This conclusion is also
fully conﬁrmed by numerical integration of Eqs. (60). For
µ
1 the dependence of the critical η0 on the ion start
delay ˜tp0 is as follows: as ˜tp0 increases from ˜tp0 = 0 to
˜tp0 = √2, the critical value of η0 decreases from ηcrΛ(µ)
to ηcr00(µ), and for ˜tp0 > √2 it remains equal to ηcr00(µ).

C. Domain of applicability of the laminar-zone
solution

The foregoing analysis of test ion acceleration has been
based on the assumption that the ion trajectories lie en-
tirely inside the laminar zone of the electron sheath. As
already mentioned in section III, this is true only within a
certain domain of our three-dimensional parameter space
(µ, γ0, Λ). Because of a weak dependence on Λ, the lim-
its of this domain can be conveniently analyzed in the
two-dimensional (µ−1, η0) plane.

Let ηlam(µ) be the threshold value of η0 = arccosh γ0
at which the trajectory of an ion with a given charge-
over-mass ratio µ just touches the outer boundary of the
relaxation zone (see Figs. 5 and 6), i.e. for η0 > ηlam(µ)
the ion trajectory lies entirely in the laminar zone, and
for η0 < ηlam(µ) it penetrates (at least partially) into the
relaxation zone. Typically this touching occurs near the
ﬁrst local maximum of the corresponding χr(t) curve at
¯t, ˜t
15–20 and lies within the reach of the TIAC code.
Because this early part of the boundary between the two
zones ceases to depend on Λ for Λ >
2.5, the same applies
∼
to the function ηlam(µ).

≃

Figure 10 shows two curves ηlam(µ), calculated for
Λ = 0 and 10, which actually span the entire dependence
of ηlam on the Λ parameter. The domain of applicability
of the laminar-zone results lies outside the grey shaded
area bounded by the ηlam(µ) curves. For protons with
µ = 1/1836 it corresponds to γ0 > 348 at Λ = 0, and to
γ0 > 537 at Λ >
2.5. The fact that the two critical val-
∼
ues ηcr0(µ) and ηcr00(µ) turn out to be deeply inside this
domain (at least for µ < 0.1) justiﬁes all the conclusions
made in sections IV A and IV B about the possibility for
a test ion to catch up with the electron front. Note that
the two curves ηcr0(µ) and ηcrΛ(µ), which span the de-
pendence of the critical value ηcr on the Λ parameter,
are virtually indistinguishable in Fig. 10.
For protons and heavier ions with µ

1/1836 the fol-
lowing conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 10. The posi-
tion of the ηlam(µ) curves indicates that ion acceleration

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper rigorous results are presented for a partic-
ular case of the TNSA mechanism of ion acceleration in
a planar electron sheath evolving from an initially mono-
energetic cloud of hot electrons. Self-consistent treat-
ment of the collisionless electron dynamics fully captures
the eﬀects of departure from the Maxwell-Boltzmann dis-
tribution. These eﬀects come to a foreground in the outer
laminar zone of the expanding electron cloud, where the
ion acceleration can be analyzed by analytical means. In
) gamma-
particular, the limiting (in the limit of t
factor γp∞ of an accelerated test ion can be calculated ex-
actly. Note that the assumption of an isothermal Boltz-
mann distribution for hot electrons leads to an inﬁnite
value of γp∞.

→ ∞

It is shown that the limiting value γp∞ is determined
primarily by the values of the two (out of the total three)
principal dimensionless parameters of the problem, the
ion-electron charge-over-mass ratio µ = meZp/mp, and

h
h
m
h
the initial gamma-factor γ0 of the accelerated electrons.
For µ > µ∗ = 1
8 a test positive particle (for example a
positron) always overtakes the electron front and reaches
γp∞ > γ0.
In the physically more interesting case of
µ < µ∗ the limiting ion energy depends on whether γ0
is above or below a certain critical value γcr = γcr(µ),
namely, we have γp∞ = γ0 for γ0 < γcr, and γp∞ > γ0
[as given by Eqs. (55) and (65)] for γ0 > γcr. Practically
insigniﬁcant dependence of γcr on the dimensionless foil
thickness Λ is limited to a variation within a factor 2 and
spanned by the functions γcr0(µ) and γcrΛ(µ) calculated
in Table I and Eqs. (53) and (64).

≤

For protons and heavier ions with µ

1/1836 we al-
ways have γ0 < γcr because the corresponding values of
exp(µ−1) are enormous and beyond practical reach.
γcr ∼
Therefore, in reality these ions can never catch up with
the electron front. Although formally the ion gamma-
factor γp(t) in this case still tends to γ0 as t
, this
fact is also practically irrelevant because γp(t) approaches
γ0 on an enormous timescale tac ≃

Our results for ion motion have been obtained un-
der the condition that the ion trajectory lies entirely in
the laminar zone of the electron sheath. Numerical in-
vestigation of the evolution of the laminar zone bound-
aries reveals that this condition imposes a lower bound
γ0 > γlam(µ) on the initial gamma-factor of hot electrons
(see Fig. 10). The latter inequality reﬂects a more gen-
eral fact that the role of the non-Boltzmann eﬀects in ion
acceleration increases with γ0, i.e. with the energy of hot
electrons. In particular, acceleration of protons by a non-
relativistic electron sheath occurs practically entirely in
the quasi-Boltzmann core of the electron cloud, where the
details of the initial electron energy distribution are “for-
gotten”. However, in the ultra-relativistic case of mono-
energetic electrons with γ0 >
300–500, acceleration of pro-
∼
tons takes place entirely in the non-Boltzmann laminar
zone of the electron sheath, where full memory of the
initial electron energy distribution has been preserved.

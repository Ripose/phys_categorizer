A method to generate ultrahigh intense electromagnetic ﬁelds is suggested, based on the laser pulse
compression, carrier frequency upshift and focusing by a counter-propagating breaking plasma wave,
relativistic ﬂying parabolic mirror. This method allows us to achieve the quantum electrodynamics
critical ﬁeld (Schwinger limit) with present day laser systems.

The invention of chirped pulse ampliﬁcation (CPA) method and recent development of laser technology led to a
stunning increase of the light intensity in a laser focal spot, [1]. Electrons in laser electromagnetic ﬁeld become
relativistic at intensities I ∼ 1018W/cm2. The ion motion strongly aﬀects the relativistic plasma dynamics starting
from I >∼ (mi/me) × 1018W/cm2 (see Ref.
[2] and references therein). Nowadays lasers produce pulses whose
intensity is approaching to 1022W/cm2 [1]. With further increase of intensity we shall meet novel physical processes
such as the radiation reaction dominated regimes, which come into play at I = 1023 − 1024W/cm2 [3], and then the
regime beyond I = 1025W/cm2 where the quantum electrodynamics (QED) description is needed as the recoil of
emitted photon momentum becomes comparable with the electron momentum [4]. Near the intensity of 1029W/cm2,
corresponding to the QED critical electric ﬁeld, light can generate electron-positron pairs from vacuum [5, 6]. Even
before that limit, vacuum begins to act nonlinearly such as vacuum polarization. These nonlinear eﬀect have attracted
a great deal of attention since [5]: they lie outside the scope of perturbation theory and shed light on the nonlinear
quantum electrodynamics properties of the vacuum. There are several ways to achieve such an intensity. One way was
demonstrated in the experiments [7], where high-energy bunch of electrons interacts with counterpropagating intense
laser pulse. In the reference frame of electrons the electric ﬁeld magnitude of the incident radiation was approximately
25% of the QED critical ﬁeld.

A technically feasible way is to increase the power of the contemporary laser system by some 7 orders of magnitude
through megajoule lasers [8], albeit quite expensive. Another way is to increase the frequency of the laser radiation and
then focus it onto a tiny region. In this method X-ray lasers can be used [9]. To achieve more “moderate” intensities,
1024 − 1025W/cm2, another scheme was suggested in Ref. [10], where a quasi-soliton wave between two foils is pumped
by the external laser ﬁeld up to an ultrahigh magnitude. Another method is based on the simultaneous laser frequency
upshifting and the pulse compression. These two phenomena were demonstrated in a broad variety of conﬁgurations,
where they were caused, in general, by diﬀerent mechanisms. In particular, the wave ampliﬁcation reﬂected at the
moving relativistic electron slab was discussed in Refs. [11] (based on the frequency up-shift of radiation reﬂected at
[12]); the backward Thompson scattering at relativistic
the relativistic mirror, as predicted by A. Einstein in Ref.
electron bunch was considered in Refs. [13]; the reﬂection at the moving ionization fronts has been studied in Refs.
[14]; “photon acceleration”schemes with co-propagating laser pulses in underdense plasma were examined in Refs.
[15]; various schemes of the counter-propagating laser pulses and the use of parametric ampliﬁcation process were
discussed in Refs. [16].

In the present paper we consider a plasma wakeﬁeld in the wave-breaking regime as a tool for generating a coherent
radiation of ultra-high intensity. Compared to the previously discussed schemes this regime demonstrates both the
robustness and coherence of the transformed laser light.

We examine the following scenario. A short intense laser pulse (the“driver pulse”) induces wakeﬁeld in a plasma.
As it is well known [17], the wakeﬁeld phase velocity vph = βphc equals the laser pulse group velocity, which is close to
the speed of light in a vacuum when the laser pulse propagates in the underdense plasma. The corresponding Lorentz
factor is γph = (1 − β2
ph)−1/2 ≈ ωd/ωpe, where ωd is the driver pulse frequency, ωpe is the Langmuir frequency. The
nonlinearity of strong wakeﬁeld causes a nonlinear wave proﬁle, including a steepening of the wave and formation
of localized maximums in the electron density – the spikes [18]. This amounts to wavebreaking regime (see Ref.
[2] and references therein). Theoretically the electron density in the spike tends to inﬁnity, but remains integrable
[2]. Suﬃciently weak counter-propagating laser pulse (the “source pulse”) will be partially reﬂected from the density

maximum. The reﬂection coeﬃcient scales as γph and the reﬂected wave vector-potential scales as γ−3
ph , as it is shown
below. As we see, the electron density maximum acts as a mirror ﬂying with the relativistic velocity vph ≈ c. The
frequency of the reﬂected radiation is up-shifted by factor (1 + βph)/(1 − βph) ≈ 4γ2
ph, in accordance with the Einstein
formula [12]. It is important that the relativistic dependence of the Langmuir frequency on the driver pulse amplitude
causes parabolic bending of constant phase surface of the plasma wave, since the driver pulse has a ﬁnite transverse
size [19]. As a result, the surface where the electron density is maximal has a shape close to a paraboloid. Because
we have a curved mirror, the frequency ˜ωs of the reﬂected radiation depends on the angle:

˜ωs =

1 + βph
1 − βph cos θ

ωs ,

where ωs is the source pulse frequency, and θ is the angle between the reﬂected wave vector and the direction of the
driver pulse propagation in the laboratory frame. The curved mirror focuses the reﬂected light. The focal spot size is
s = λs((1−βph)/(1+βph))1/2 ≈
of the order of the diﬀraction limited size. In the reference frame of the wakeﬁeld it is λ′
λs/2γph, where λs is the wavelength of the source pulse. In the laboratory frame the focal spot size is approximately
λs/4γ2
ph along the paraboloid axis, and ≈ λs/2γph in the transverse direction. In the focal spot the resulting intensity
gain factor scales with γph as γ−3
ph, where Ds is the diameter of the eﬃciently
reﬂected portion of the source pulse beam. This value can be great enough to substantially increase the intensity of
the reﬂected light in the focus, even up to the QED critical electric ﬁeld.

ph × (˜ωs/ωs)2 × (Ds/λ′

s)2 = 64(Ds/λs)2γ3

In order to calculate the reﬂection coeﬃcient, we consider the interaction of an electromagnetic wave with a
maximum of the electron density formed in a breaking Langmuir wave. In the laboratory frame, this interaction can
be described by the wave equation

∂ttAz − c2∆Az +

4πe2n (x − vpht)
meγe

Az = 0 ,

where Az is the z-component of the vector potential, γe is the electron Lorentz factor, and γe ≈ γph near the maximum
of the density in the wakewave wavebreaking regime.

According to the continuity equation ∂tne + div(neve) = 0, the electron density in the stationary Langmuir wave
is given by n = n0vph/(vph − ve), where the electron velocity ve varies from −vph to vph (see Ref.
[18]), and the
electron density varies from the minimal value = n0/2 to inﬁnity (integrable). For the breaking plasma wakewave,
in every wave period approximately a half of electrons are located in the spike of the electron density. Therefore we
can approximate the electron density by n (x − vpht) = (1 + λpδ(x − vpht))n0/2, where λp is the wakeﬁeld wavelength
and δ(x) is the Dirac delta function. This approximation is valid when the density maximum thickness is suﬃciently
less than the collisionless skin depth c/ωpe and source pulse wavelength in the wakeﬁeld rest frame, i. e. when the
wakeﬁeld is close to the wave-breaking regime.

In the reference frame comoving with the plasma wakewave, Eq. (2) has the same form. The Lorentz transformation

to this frame is given by t′ = (t − vphx/c2)γph, x′ = (x − vpht)γph, y′ = y, z′ = z.

We seek for solution to Eq.

vphkx)γph, k′
Using this ansatz, from Eq. (2) in the moving frame we obtain

x = (kx + vphω/c2)γph, k′

where q2 = ω′

at the delta potential. The solution is A(x′) = exp(iqx′) + ρ(q) exp(−iqx′) for x′ ≥ 0 (incident and reﬂected wave),
and A(x′) = τ (q) exp(iqx′) for x′ < 0 (transmitted wave), where ρ(q) = −χ/(χ + 2iq) and τ (q) = iq/(χ + 2iq). In a
nonlinear Langmuir wave, its wavelength depends on the wave amplitude [18], and for the breaking wakewave we have
λp ≈ 4(2γph)1/2c/ωpe. In this case χ = 4(2γph)1/2ωpe/c. Taking ω′
s into account, we ﬁnd that the reﬂection
s
coeﬃcient, deﬁned as a ratio of the reﬂected to the incident energy ﬂux, in the co-moving frame is ≈ (ωd/ωs)2 /2γ3

FIG. 1: The electron density in the wake of the driver laser pulse at t = 14 × 2π/ωd. The (x, y = −6λ, z)-plane: density proﬁle
along the symmetry axis. Blue curves for density values n = 0.12, 0.24, 0.36ncr on the corresponding perpendicular planes of
symmetry. Isosurfaces for value n = 0.15ncr, “blue gas” for lower values.

Theoretically, the actual gain can be even greater, because a) the estimation (4) corresponds to one-dimensinal case,
whereas the density modulation in the 3D breaking wakewave is stronger, b) the reﬂectance (4) of the 3D paraboloidal
mirror is greater at the periphery.

We consider the following example. A one-micron laser pulse (driver) generates wakeﬁeld in a plasma with density
ne = 1017cm−3. The corresponding plasma wavelength is λp ≈ 100µm. The Lorentz factor, associated with the phase
velocity of the wakeﬁeld, is estimated as γph ≈ ωd/ωpe ≈ 100. The counter-propagating one-micron laser pulse with
intensity Is = 1017W/cm2 (source) is partially reﬂected and focused by the wakeﬁeld cusp. If the eﬃciently reﬂected
beam diameter is Ds = 200µm, then, according to Eq. (5), the ﬁnal intensity in the focal spot is ˜Isf ≈ 1.5×1029W/cm2.
The driver pulse intensity should be suﬃciently high and its beam diameter should be enough to give such a wide
mirror, assume Id = 1018W/cm2 and Dd = 800µm. Thus, if both the driver and source are one-wavelength pulses,
they carry 17J and 0.1J, respectively. We see that in an optimistic scenario the QED critical electric ﬁeld may be
achieved with the present-day laser technology!

To demonstrate the feasibility of the eﬀect of the light reﬂection and focusing by the breaking wakewave, we
performed three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations using the code REMP (Relativistic Electro-Magnetic
Particle-mesh code) based on scheme [20]. In the simulations the driver pulse propagates in the direction of the x-axis.
Its dimensionless amplitude is ad = 1.7 which corresponds to peak intensity 4 × 1018W/cm2 × (1µm/λd)2, where λd is
the driver wavelength. The driver is linearly polarized along the z-axis, it has the gaussian shape, its FWHM size is
3λd × 6λd × 6λd. The source pulse propagates in the opposite direction. Its wavelength is two times greater than the
driver wavelength, λs = 2λd. The source pulse amplitude is chosen to be small, as = 0.05, to reduce the distortion of
the wakewave. The pulse shape is rectangular in the x-direction and Gaussian in the transverse direction, its size is
6λd × 6λd × 6λd. To distinguish the electromagnetic radiation of the driver from the source pulses, we set the source
pulse to be linearly polarized in the direction perpendicular to the driver polarization, i. e. along the y-axis. The
laser pulses propagate in the underdense plasma slab with the electron density ne = 0.09ncr, which corresponds to
the Langmuir frequency ωpe = 0.3ωd. The plasma slab is localized at 2λd < x < 13λd in the simulation box with size
22λd × 19.5λd × 19.2λd. The simulations were carried out on 720 processors of the supercomputer HP Alpha Server
SC ES40 at JAERI Kansai. The mesh size is dx = λd/100, total number of quasiparticles is 1010 (ten billion). The
boundary conditions are absorbing on the x-axis and periodic in the transverse directon, both for the electromagnetic
ﬁelds and quasi-particles. We emphasize that the simulation grid must be and in fact was chosen to be ﬁne enough
to resolve the huge frequency up-shift given by Eq.(1), exhausting all the supercomputer resources.

The simulation results are presented in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 shows the plasma wakewave induced by the driver
laser pulse as modulations in the electron density. We see the electron density cusps in the form of paraboloids. They
move with velocity vph ≈ 0.87c, the corresponding gamma-factor is γph ≈ 2. Their transverse size is much larger
than the wavelength of the counterpropagating source pulse in the reference frame of the wakeﬁeld. As seen from the
electron density proﬁle along the axis of the driver pulse propagation, the wakewave dynamics is close to wave-beaking
regime. Each electron density maximum forms a semi-transparent parabolic mirror, which reﬂects a part of the source
pulse radiation.

In Fig. 2 we present the electric ﬁeld components. The driver pulse is seen in the cross-section of the z-component

of the electric ﬁeld in the (x, y, z = 0)-plane. The source pulse and its reﬂection is seen in the cross-section of the
y-component of the electric ﬁeld in the (x, y = 0, z)-plane. The part of the source pulse radiation is reﬂected from
the ﬂying paraboloidal mirrors, then it focuses yielding the peak intensity in the focal spot, and ﬁnally it defocuses
and propagates as a spherical short wave train, whose frequency depend on the wave vector direction, in agreement
with Eq.(1). This process is clearly seen in the animations produced from the data (see authors’ website). The main
part of the reﬂected light power is concentrated whithin the angle ∼ 1/γph, hence this coherent high-frequency beam
resembles a searchlight. The reﬂected part has the same number of cycles as the source pulse, as expected, since
it is Lorentz invriant. The wavelength and duration of the reﬂected pulse are approximately 14 times less than the
wavelength and duration of the source pulse, in agreement with Eq.(1) since (1 + βph)/(1 − βph) ≈ 14.4. The focal
spot size of the reﬂected radiation is much smaller than the wavelength of the source pulse. The electric ﬁeld in the
focal spot is approximately 16 times higher than in the source pulse. Therefore, the intensity increases 256 times in
agreement with estimation (5).

We emphasize that the eﬃcient reﬂection is achievable only when the wakeﬁeld is close to the wave-breaking regime
and the cusps in the electron density are formed. As we see in the simulations, the reﬂection and focusing is robust
and even distorted (to some extent) wakewave can eﬃciently reﬂect and focus the source pulse radiation. We also
observe that despite the moderate reﬂection coeﬃcient, the colossal frequency up-shift and focusing by a suﬃciently
wide (transversely) wakewave give us a huge increase of the light intensity.

Similar processes may occur in laser-plasma interation spontaneously, e.g. when a short laser pulse exciting plasma
wakewave is a subject of the stimulated backward Raman scattering or a portion of the pulse is reﬂected back from
the plasma inhomogeneity. Then the backward scattered electromagnetic wave interacts with plasma density modu-
lations in the wakewave moving with relativistic velocity. According to scenario described above, the electromagnetic
radiation, reﬂected by the wakewave, propagates in the forward direction as a high-frequency strongly collimated
(within the angle ∼ 1/γph) electromagnetic beam.

We have proposed the scheme of the relativistic plasma wake caustic light intensiﬁcation, which can be achieved

due to the reﬂection and focusing of light from the maximum of the electron density in the plasma wakewave at
close to the wave-breaking regime. The presented results of 3D PIC simulations provide us a proof of principle of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld intensiﬁcation during reﬂection of the laser radiation at the ﬂying paraboloidal relativistic mirrors
in the plasma wakewave. With the ideal realization of the described scheme we can achieve extremely high electric
ﬁelds (in the laboratory reference frame) aproaching the QED critical ﬁeld with the present-day laser technology. We
envision the present example is just one manifestation of what we foresee as the emergence of relativistic engineering.

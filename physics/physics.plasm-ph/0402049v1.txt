(Dated: December 22, 2013)

Theoretical and numerical studies are presented of the nonlinear amplitude modulation of dust-
acoustic (DA) waves propagating in an unmagnetized three component, weakly-coupled, fully ionized
plasma consisting of electrons, positive ions and charged dust particles, considering perturbations
oblique to the carrier wave propagation direction. The stability analysis, based on a nonlinear
Schr¨odinger-type equation (NLSE), shows that the wave may become unstable; the stability criteria
depend on the angle θ between the modulation and propagation directions. Explicit expressions for
the instability rate and threshold have been obtained in terms of the dispersion laws of the system.
The possibility and conditions for the existence of diﬀerent types of localized excitations have also
been discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the dynamics of dust contaminated plasmas (DP) has recently received considerable interest due to
their occurrence in real charged particle systems, e.g. in space and laboratory plasmas and the novel physics involved
in their description [1]. An issue of particular interest is the existence of special acoustic-like oscillatory modes, e.g.
the dust-acoustic waves (DAW) and dust-ion-acoustic waves (DIAW), which were theoretically predicted about a
decade ago [2, 3] and later experimentally conﬁrmed [4, 5]. The DAW, which we consider herein, relies on a new
physical mechanism in which inertial dust grains oscillate against a thermalized background of electrons and ions
which provide the necessary restoring force. The phase speed of the DAW is much smaller than the electron and ion
thermal speeds, and the DAW frequency is below the dust plasma frequency.

A long-known generic characteristic of nonlinear wave propagation is amplitude modulation due to the nonlinear self-
interaction of the carrier wave, which generates higher harmonics. The standard method for studying this mechanism
is a multiple space and time scale technique [6, 7], which leads to a nonlinear Schr¨odinger-type equation (NLSE)
describing the evolution of the wave envelope. It has been shown that, under certain conditions, waves may develop a
Benjamin-Feir-type (modulational) instability (MI), i.e. their modulated envelope may collapse under the inﬂuence of
external perturbations. Furthermore, the NLSE-based analysis, already present in a wide variety of contexts [8, 9, 10],
reveals the possibility of the existence of localized excitations (solitary wave structures) whose form and behaviour
depends on criteria similar to the ones necessary for the MI to occur.

Not surprisingly, plasma wave theory has provided an excellent test bed for this approach since a long time ago
[7, 11 - 19] and dusty plasma waves were no exception [20 – 22]. Among other noteworthy results, electron plasma
modes have been shown to be stable against parallel modulation [11]; so do the ion plasma modes, yet only for
perturbations below a speciﬁc wavenumber threshold [12]. Electron and ion acoustic modes, even though stable to
parallel modulation [11, 13, 14, 23], are found to be unstable if one takes into account ﬁnite temperature eﬀects
[12, 15, 16] or, most interesting to us, when subject to an oblique modulation of the wave amplitude [17 – 19]. These
results, based on Poisson - moment plasma equations, have been conﬁrmed by similar studies from a kinetic point
of view [24], for the ion - acoustic wave in an electron - ion plasma. In dusty plasma, the amplitude modulation of
[20 – 22]; similar studies have been carried out for oscillations
the DAW and DIAW has been investigated in Ref.
in (strongly-coupled) dusty plasma quasi-crystals [25 - 26]. Finally, let us mention that attempts have been made to
reﬁne the description of the DIAW modulation by including non-planar geometry eﬀects [27], following an idea applied
earlier in the KdV (Korteweg-de Vries) description of a dusty plasma [28], and dust-charge ﬂuctuation eﬀects [21], an
[29, 30]; also [1]). These eﬀects, omitted in
issue of particular importance in the present-time DP surveys (see e.g.
the present investigation, will be considered in a forthcoming work.

In this paper, we study the modulational instability of dust-acoustic plasma waves propagating in an unmagnetized
plasma contaminated by a population of charged dust grains, whose dimensions and charge are assumed constant,
for simplicity. Amplitude modulation is allowed to take place in an oblique direction, at an angle θ with respect to
the carrier wave propagation direction. Once an explicit criterion for the occurrence of instability is established, our
aim is to trace the inﬂuence of θ on the conditions for the MI onset, and determine the magnitude of the associated
instability growth rate. Finally, we shall also examine the possibility of the formation of localized excitations and
discuss their characteristics. Exact new expressions are derived for all quantities of interest, in terms of the system’s
dispersion laws. Among other physical parameters discussed, our formulation leaves open the choice of sign of dust
charge (sign qd =
1) (most often taken to be negative since this is the most frequently occurring case [1]) and the
dust pressure (‘temperature’) scaling. Our aim in doing so is to address, among others, the question of the inﬂuence
of the dust charge sign on the amplitude modulation mechanism. We may also attempt to clarify the eﬀect of taking
(or not) into account the dust pressure evolution equation (omitted e.g. in [20]) in the analysis.

The manuscript is organized as follows. In the next Section, the analytical model is introduced. In Section III,
we carry out a perturbative analysis by introducing appropriate slow space and time evolution scales, and derive a
NLS-type equation which governs the (slow) amplitude evolution in time and space. The exact form of dispersion and
nonlinearity coeﬃcients in the NLS-type equation is presented and discussed. In Section IV, we carry out a stability
analysis of the NLSE allowing for a thorough study of the DAW stability in various regions of the physical parameters
involved. The analysis is pursued in Section V, where we discuss the possibility of the existence of localized solutions
of the NLSE, and identify their forms in diﬀerent parameter regions. Finally, we brieﬂy summarize our results in the
concluding Section.

We consider a three component collisionless unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of electrons (mass m, charge e),
ions (mass mi, charge qi = +Zie) and heavy dust particulates (mass md, charge qd = s Zde), henceforth denoted by
e, i, d respectively. Dust mass and charge will be taken to be constant, for simplicity. Note that both negative and
positive dust charge cases are considered, distinguished by the charge sign s = sgn qd =

1 in the formulae below.

The basis of our study includes the moment - Poisson system of equations for the dust particles and Boltzmann

distributed electrons and ions. The dust (number) density nd is governed by the (continuity) equation

to a previous work [20] where Eq. (3) has been omitted. As a matter of fact, expressions (9) - (11) therein are readily

model expressions [20, 32]; this is why we chose not to analyse the DIAW case any further, in the same text.

A. Outline of the method

Let S be the state (column) vector (n, u, p, φ)T , describing the system’s state at a given position r and instant t.

We shall consider small deviations from the equilibrium state S(0) = (1, 0, 1, 0)T by taking

S = S(0) + ǫ S(1) + ǫ2 S(2) + ... = S(0) +

take into account the inﬂuence of an oblique amplitude modulation on the DA wave, we will assume that all perturbed
states depend on the fast scales via the phase θ1 = k

becomes decoupled from the rest, that is, for σ = 0), should one correctly consider the limit σ = 0 in Eqs. (8), one
should discard all three of the last lines in (11). For convenience, one may consider instead of the vectorial relation
(11) the one obtained by taking its scalar product with the wavenumber k. Finally, we see that Eqs. (32) - (34) of

Notice that these expressions are isotropic i.e. independent of the value of θ.

The nonlinear self-interaction of the carrier wave also results in the creation of a zeroth harmonic, in this order; its
strength is analytically determined by taking into account the l = 0 component of the three ﬁrst third-order reduced
equations (i.e. (10) - (12) for n = 3, l = 0) together with the corresponding fourth 2nd-order equation (i.e. (13) for
n = 2, l = 0). The result is conveniently expressed in terms of the square modulus of the (n = 1, l = 1) quantities,

It seems appropriate, here, to point out the qualitative diﬀerence between P given in (29) as compared to relevant
previous expressions: the existence of σ may aﬀect the sign of the P coeﬃcient. For instance, taking σ = 0 (i.e.
= 0 this is
ν1 = ν2 = 1), P is readily seen to be negative for parallel modulation, i.e. setting θ = 0; however, for σ
no longer the case, since P changes sign at some critical value of k (to see this, study the sign of ν2 versus k [33]).
Furthermore, a similar remark holds for the eﬀect of an oblique modulation on the sign of P ; we will come back to
this subtle point in the next subsection.
The nonlinearity coeﬃcient Q =

A3/A1 is due to the carrier wave self-interaction. Distinguishing diﬀerent

contributions, Q can be split into ﬁve distinct parts, viz.

best of our knowledge. Their importance will be discussed in the following. Note that Q1, Q2 do not depend on the

F. Behaviour of coeﬃcients for small k

A preliminary result regarding the behaviour (and the sign) of the NLSE coeﬃcients P and Q, at least for long

wavelengths, may be obtained by considering the limit of small k

1 in the above formulae.

The parallel (θ = 0) and oblique (θ

= 0) modulation cases have to be distinguished straightaway. For small values

≪

of k (k

1), P is negative and varies as

≪

in the parallel modulation case (i.e. θ = 0), thus tending to zero for vanishing k, while for θ
goes to inﬁnity as

for vanishing k. Therefore, the slightest deviation by θ of the amplitude variation direction with respect to the
wave propagation direction results in a change in sign of the dispersion coeﬃcient P . Given the importance of the
coeﬃcient product P Q (to be discussed in the next Section), one may wonder whether this is suﬃcient for the stability
characteristics of the DA wave to change. Let us see what happens with the Q in the limit of small k.

For all cases, Q varies as

1/k for small k

1 [34]; the exact expression in fact depends on the angle θ. In the

general case (θ

= 0), the result reads

A careful study shows that Q is negative, in fact, for all possible values of the physical parameters of interest (i.e. α,
β, γ, σ - all positive - and s
1). For vanishing θ, however, the approximate expression for Q, yet apparently quite
similar, is now positive, i.e.

±

[β (2sαβ + 3) + 2γσ] [β (2sαβ + 3) + γ (γ + 1) σ]

(46)

In conclusion, both coeﬃcients P and Q change sign when ‘switching on’ theta. Indeed, obliqueness in modulation
is expected to inﬂuence the stability proﬁle of the system; this point seems to conﬁrm (and complete) the general
[17] for the ion acoustic wave in an electron ion plasma without dust.
qualitative arguments put forward in Ref.
Nevertheless, at all cases, the product of P and Q is negative for small k, ensuring, as we shall see in the following
section, stability for long perturbation wavelengths. As a by-product of this analysis, we see that taking into account
Q1, Q3 and Q4 does not seem to inﬂuence the dynamics in the low wavenumber k parameter range.

The standard stability analysis [8, 34] consists in linearizing around the monochromatic (Stokes’s wave) solution of

the NLSE (28)

(notice the amplitude dependence of the frequency) by setting

and taking the perturbation ˆψ1 to be of the form: ˆψ1 = ˆψ1,0 ei(ˆkζ
ˆωτ ) + c.c., (the perturbation wavenumber ˆk and
the frequency ˆω should be distinguished from their carrier wave homologue quantities, denoted by k and ω). Now,
substituting into (28), one readily obtains the nonlinear dispersion relation

One immediately sees that the wave will be stable for all values of ˆk if the product P Q is negative. However, for
positive P Q > 0, instability sets in for wavenumbers below a critical value ˆkcr =

In the contour plots presented below (see ﬁgures 1, 2, 5), we have depicted the P Q = 0 boundary curve against the
normalized wavenumber k/kD (in abscissa) and angle θ (between 0 and π); the area in black (white) represents the
region in the (k
θ) plane where the product is negative (positive); instability therefore occurs for values inside the
white area. We have considered values of the wavenumber k between zero and upto 4 times the Debye wavenumber
kD (yet mostly focusing our attention on the low k region). Pitch angle θ is allowed to vary between zero and π/2;
as a matter of fact, all plots are π

For negative dust (s =

1; see ﬁg. 1) the product possesses positive values for angle values between zero and
51◦; we see that instability sets in above a wavenumber threshold which is clearly seen to decrease as the
θ
modulation pitch angle θ increases from zero to approximately 17 degrees, and then increases again up to θ
51◦.
Nevertheless, beyond that value (and up to π/2) the wave remains stable; this is even true for the wavenumber regions
[1.0, 3.6]
where the wave would be unstable to a parallel modulation: see e.g. the interval where θ = 0 and k/kD ∈
approximately, in ﬁgure 1. The inverse eﬀect is also present: even though certain k values correspond to stability for
θ = 0, the same modes may become unstable when subject to an oblique modulation (θ
= 0); this is mostly true for
long wavelengths (small k). Notice the periodicity with respect to θ.

≈

A similar behaviour is witnessed in the case of positive dust (s = +1; see ﬁg. 2), yet the instability threshold kcr

for a given value of θ is quite higher: positive dust rather appears to favour stability.

In all cases, the wave appears to be globally stable for large angle θ modulation (between 0.9 and π/2 radians,
i.e. 51◦ to 90◦) and unstable for smaller values of θ. For parallel modulation (θ = 0), the sign of the product P Q is
basically opposite to that of Q, since P < 0 for all values of k; the wave is then stable for large wavelengths λ
λD
1), and potentially unstable for higher values of k (a similar qualitative behaviour has been reported
(i.e. for k/kD ≪
for the ion-acoustic wave case (i.e. without dust) [11 - 15].

≫

A ﬁnal word is in row, concerning the eﬀect of taking into account the pressure evolution equation (3), often omitted
for simplicity. Given the above results, this amounts to wondering what the diﬀerence would be, should we simply set
σ = 0 in expression (29) for P and thus plainly omit Q3 and Q4, deﬁned above. A qualitative answer is attempted
in ﬁgure 5, where we have depicted the P Q product in this case. The qualitative results obtained so far do not seem
to be strongly modiﬁed, at least not for low values of k (say, below k
2kD) and deﬁnitely not as far as the angle
dependence of stability is concerned. The diﬀerence in stability regions obtained for higher k is rather negligible for
long wavelengths (say, below k
1.5kD). Nevertheless, including the pressure equation in the description seems to
describe the problem in a more precise manner, and also somewhat restricts the instability region, since stability is
now predicted for short wavelengths (above, say, k

3.6kD) and low θ; compare ﬁgs. 1a, 2a to 5a, 6a, respectively.

V. NONLINEAR EXCITATIONS

Let us discuss the possibility of the existence of localized excitations in our system. The NLSE (28) is known to
possess distinct types of localized constant proﬁle (solitary wave) solutions, depending on the sign of the product P Q.
We shall now brieﬂy outline the method employed to derive their form and discuss their relevance to our problem.

Following Ref. [36], we may seek a solution of Eq. (28) in the form

where ρ, σ are real variables which are determined by substituting into the NLSE and separating real and imaginary
parts. The diﬀerent types of solution thus obtained are clearly summarized in the following paragraphs.

Summarizing, we see that the regions depicted in ﬁgs. 1, 2, 5, 6 actually distinguish the regions where diﬀerent
types of localized solutions may exist: bright (dark or grey) solitons will occur in white (black) regions (the diﬀerent
types of NLS excitations are exhaustively reviewed in [36]). Furthermore, soliton characteristics will depend on the
dispersion laws via the P and Q coeﬃcients; for instance, regions with higher values of P (or lower values of Q) - see
ﬁgs. 3, 4 - will support wider (spatially more extended) localized excitations.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

13

This work has been devoted to the study of the conditions for occurrence of the modulational instability of the
dust-acoustic waves propagating in an unmagnetized dusty plasma. Considering the Poisson-moment equations for
the dust and allowing for modulation to occur in an oblique manner, we have shown that the DA wave modulational
instability depends strongly on the angle between the propagation and modulation directions. As a matter of fact,
the region of parameter values where instability occurs is rather extended for angle θ values up to a certain threshold,
and, on the contrary, smeared out for higher θ values (and up to 90 degrees, then going on in a π
2 - periodic fashion).
Furthermore, we have studied the possibility of the formation of localized structures (solitary waves) in the system.
Distinct types of localized excitations (envelope solitons) have been shown to exist. Their type and propagation
characteristics depend on the carrier wave wavenumber k and the modulation angle θ.

Summarizing our results, we have seen that

(i) obliqueness in the amplitude modulation direction has a strong inﬂuence on the conditions for the modulational
instability to occur: regions which are stable to a parallel modulation may become unstable when subject to an
oblique modulation, and vice versa;
(ii) large-angle modulation seems to have a stabilizing eﬀect; on the contrary, small-to-medium angle (say below 50
degrees) modulation enhances instability;
(iii) DAW-related localized excitations may appear and propagate in a dusty plasma; modulationally stable (unstable)
(k, θ) regions support envelope solitary waves of the bright (dark) type;
(iv) the type and characteristics of the latter (localized modes) depend on the value of θ: for given low k, dark solitons
(or holes) are wider as θ becomes higher (see ﬁg. 4); for higher k, bright (dark) solitons become narrower (wider) as
θ increases; ﬁnally, for given θ values below (above) a threshold of, say, 51 degrees, bright (dark) excitations will be
narrower (wider) for higher k (see ﬁg. 4);
1) dust cases, we have shown that positive dust enhances
(v) comparing the positive (s = +1) to negative (s =
stability and rather favours dark-type excitations (hole solitons); furthermore, low k dark envelope solitons appear to
be narrower with positive dust; for higher k there is practically no qualitative diﬀerence between the two dust charge
sign cases;
(vi) As a ﬁnal comment, let us point out that taking the dust pressure equation (3) into account, we have obtained a
wider stability region for small θ values, yet only for high wavenumbers. The existence of dark-type localized envelopes
of high k modes subject to slightly oblique (low θ) modulation is thus predicted; cf. ﬁgs. 1a, 2a to 5a, 6a, respectively.
However, for wavenumbers below, say, k = kD, there is no qualitative diﬀerence due to the consideration of (3).

−

Our aim has been to put forward a model study of the DAW modulation which is generic, i.e.

incorporating
several previous descriptions, which may be recovered for diﬀerent choices of the physical parameters involved in
the formulation. Dust charge was assumed to be constant and the plasma geometry was taken to be Cartesian and
inﬁnite, for simplicity. Thus, our work complements the investigation by Tang and Xue [38] who examined only the
modulational instability of DAWs against oblique modulations, including an ad hoc charging equation and a speciﬁc
form of the adiabatic law for warm charged dust grains which are negatively charged. The present paper, on the
other hand, discusses the multi- dimensional modulational instabilities of dust acoustic waves in plasmas containing
both negatively and positively charged dust grains, as well as provides a detailed discussion of various types of dust
acoustic envelope solitons and their respective parameter regions of existence, leaving the choice of the value of the
parameter γ = cp/cV free in the algebra.

[23] Strictly speaking, this result is only true for long wavelengths λ, compared to the Debye length λD (i.e. small wavenumber
k ≪ kD), as can be readily seen by a numerical analysis of Eq. (39) in Ref. [13]; this is conﬁrmed by Refs. [11] and [14].
It has been argued that, in principle, the wavenumber threshold kcr for the MI is very high, since ion acoustic modes are
physically valid for small k, given that Landau damping prevails above a certain value of k [24] (note that this remark does
not concern dusty plasma waves); nevertheless, kcr lowers down once the description is reﬁned - cf. discussion in ref. [18].

Also note, for reference, that upon setting: α = −1/2, α′ = 1/6, β = 1 and s = 1 in (8), one readily recovers the model
equation system for the ion-acoustic waves, e.g. exactly (1) in Ref. [16] (also Ref. [13] for σ = 0).

This does not contradict the remark made in Ref. [16] that P > 0 for k < 1 (for θ = 0 only).

[34] This remark is in agreement with the ion-acoustic wave case: see Eq. (41) in Ref. [13]); as a matter of fact, the factor 1/3

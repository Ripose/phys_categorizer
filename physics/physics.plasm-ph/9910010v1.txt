Abstract

Fermionic path integral Monte Carlo simulations have been applied to study the equilibrium properties of the
hydrogen and deuterium in the density and temperature range of 1.6 < rs < 14.0 and 5000K < T < 167000K.
We use this technique to determine the phase diagram by identifying the plasma, the molecular, atomic and
metallic regime. We explain how one can identify the phases in the path integral formalism and discuss the
state of hydrogen for 5 points in the temperature-density plane. Further we will provide arguments for the
nature of the transitions between the regimes.

Introduction

The phase diagram of hydrogen has been studied intensively with diﬀerent theoretical ap-
proaches [1],[2], simulation techniques [3],[4] and experiments [5],[6]. From theory, the prin-
cipal eﬀects at low densities are well-known. On the other hand, the properties at inter-
mediate density are not yet well understood, and the phase diagram is not yet accurately
determined. In particular, the nature of the transition to a metallic state is still an open
question.

In this article, we would like to show how these questions can be addressed by path
integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. Using this approach, we derived the phase dia-
gram in Fig.1 where we distinguish between molecular, atomic, metallic and plasma regimes.
We will demonstrate how these diﬀerent states can be identiﬁed from PIMC simulations.
The imaginary-time path integral formalism [7] is based on the position-space density ma-
trix ρ(R, R′, β), which can be used to determine the equilibrium expectation value of any
operator ˆO,

where R represents the coordinates of all particles. The low temperature density matrix
ρ(R, R′, β) = hR|e−βH|R′i can be expressed as product of high temperature density matrices
ρ(R, R, τ ) with the time step τ = β/M . In position space, this is a convolution,

ρ(R0, RM ; β) =

dR1 dR2 · · · dRM −1 ρ(R0, R1; τ ) ρ(R1, R2; τ ) · · · ρ(RM −1, RM ; τ ).

This high dimensional integral can be integrated using Monte Carlo methods. Each particle
is represented by a closed path in imaginary time. Fermi statistics is taken into account by
considering the fermion density matrix, which can be expressed by considering all permu-

where A is the antisymmetrization projection operator. Cancellation of positive and neg-
ative contributions leads to the fermion sign problem, which is solved approximately by
restricting the paths within a nodal surface derived from the free-particle density matrix
[8].

2 Phase diagram of hydrogen and deuterium

We used PIMC simulation with 32 protons and 32 electrons and a time step τ = 1/106 K
to generate the phase diagram shown in Fig. 1. In the low density and low temperature
regime, we ﬁnd a molecular ﬂuid. In the proton-proton correlation function shown in Fig. 2,
one ﬁnds a clear peak at the bond length of 0.75 ˚A. We determine the number of molecules
as well as other compound particles by a cluster analysis based on the distances. Using
this approach we can estimate the number of bound states (see [10]). We can also estimate

Figure 2: Distribution functions for a selection of 5 simulation of hydrogen at diﬀerent tem-
peratures and densities, one in each column: 1) a plasma, 2) a atomic ﬂuid, 3) a molecular
ﬂuid, 4) a molecular ﬂuid with metallic properties, and 5) a metallic ﬂuid. The rows show
the following: (1) proton-proton correlation function gpp(r) multiplied by the density, which
means the area under the peak at the bond length of r = 0.75˚A indicates the number of
molecules, (2) [gpe(r) − 1]r2, where the ﬁrst peak hints to the existence of bound electrons in
the ground state, (3) pair correlation function for electrons with parallel spins demonstrat-
ing the Pauli exclusion principle, (4) pair correlation function for electrons with anti-parallel
spins, where the peak is caused by a localization of wave function along the molecular bond,
and (5) distribution of the fraction ν of electrons involved in a permutation. A peak near
ν = 0 represent a small degree of degeneracy of the electrons, while one near ν = 1 implies
a highly degenerate electron gas.

the fraction of molecules and atoms to determine the regime boundaries. However at high
density, a clear deﬁnition of those species is diﬃcult to give.

Starting in the molecular regime, one ﬁnds that increasing temperature at constant
density leads to gradual dissociation of molecules followed by a regime, with a majority of
atoms. The atoms are then gradually ionized at even higher temperatures. Lowering the
density at constant temperature leads to a decrease in the number of molecules, or atoms
respectively, due to entropy eﬀects.

If the density is increased at constant temperature, pressure dissociation diminishes
the molecular fraction. This transition was described by Magro et. al.
Its precise
nature is still a topic of our current research. Using PIMC simulations, one ﬁnds it occurs
within a small density interval and we predict that it is connected with both the molecular-
atomic and insulator-metal transition. We determine the fraction of electrons involved in a
permutation as an indication of electronic delocalization. Permuting electron are required
to form a Fermi surface, which means that a high number of permutations indicate a high
degree of degeneracy of the electrons. Permuting electrons form long chains of paths and
therefore occupy delocalized states. This delocalization destabilizes the hydrogen molecules.
Before all bonds are broken, one ﬁnds a molecular ﬂuid with some permuting electrons, which
could indicate the existence of a molecular ﬂuid with metallic properties.

[9].

The boundaries of the metallic regime are determined by two eﬀects. With increasing
temperature, the degree of degeneracy of the electrons is simply reduced. If the temperature
is lowered, the attraction to the protons becomes more relevant, which localizes the electron
wave function and decreases the degree of degeneracy also (see Fig. 1).

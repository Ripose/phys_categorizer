NONLINEAR TWO-DIMENSIONAL POTENTIAL PLASMA WAKE WAVES

Abstract

The condition for potential description of the wake waves, generated by ﬂat or cylin-

drical driving electron bunch in cold plasma is derived.

The two-dimensional nonlinear equation for potential valid for small values of that

is obtained and solved by the separation of variables. Solutions in the form of cnoidal

waves,existing behind the moving bunch at small values of vertical coordinate,are ob-

tained.In particular,at some boundary conditions,corresponding to blow-out regime in

the underdense plasma,the solution represents by a solitary nonlinear wave.

Approximate solution is also obtained using the method of multiple scales.

The indications are obtained that the dependense of the amplitudes on longitudi-

nal coordinate determines essentially,even in the ﬁrst approximation,by driving bunch

charge distribution. The wake wave amplitude can increase at some conditions along the

longitudinal distanse from the rear part of the bunch.

1 INTRODUCTION

Analysis of the one dimensional longitudinal,transverse and coupled transverse lon-

gitudinal plain nonlinear waves in cold relativistic plasma are given in the review [1]

(see therein the references on original works).One dimensional nonlinear longitudinal

1

waves,generated by the driving bunches with the inﬁnite transverse dimensions,were con-

sidered in [2]-[8].

In the present work the two-dimensional nonlinear wake waves,generated by the ﬂat

or cylindrical electron bunch,are discussed.

The corresponding linear problem was considered in [9],[10] and was found,in cor-

respondance with previous result [11],that the magnetic ﬁeld in wake wave in linear

approximation is equal zero.This result connected with the absence of the energy ﬂow

in the wake wave and the absence of the vortexes in plasma electron motion in linear

approximation.

displasments.

In the one dimensional nonlinear treatment [2]-[8] the magnetic ﬁeld in the wake wave

is also zero (by construction),due to the symmetry of the problem relative to transverse

In two-dimensional wake wave the magnetic ﬁeld is zero only when vortexes connected

with the plasma electron motion are zero,which in this case is an additional requirement

on the type of the motion of the plasma electrons.The wake waves in this case are po-

tential,i.e. electric ﬁeld components Ez, Ey can be expressed as a gradient of one scalar

function ϕ(y, z),and components of the plasma electrons current also can be expressed

through one scalar function ψ(y, z)

The approximate nonlinear equation for potential ϕ can be obtained,using Maxwell

equations and approximate equations of the motion. Equation for potential has an exact

solutions with the separated variables for small values of the transverse coordinate.

Among the solutions,which are ﬁnite,nonlinear waves by cnoidal nature, at some

boundary conditions,associated with the blow-out regime, there exists the solution (on

separatirix) in form of the solitary wave.

For arbitrary values of the transverse coordinate the approximate solution for poten-

tial ,using multiple scales perturbative method is found.

2 VORTEX-FREE WAKE WAVE

Consider the wake wave generated in the cold neutral plasma,with the immobile

ions,by the ﬂat electron bunch, which has horisontal dimensions 2a much larger than

vertical dimension 2b,longitudinal dimension is 2d.The charge density in the bunch is

nb,electron plasma density is n0,and we consider both overdense and underdense regimes.

Bunch is moving along z-axis with the constant velocity v0 < c in lab system.All the

physical quantities in the question are considered as a function of vertical coordinate y

Nonlinear term in eq. (15) is proportional to ∂2ϕ

∂y2 and can be large.In the linear approx-
imation solution of eq. (15) lost the y-dependence and describes the harmonic oscilation

with the plasma frequency on z;y-dependence of the solution comes from boundary con-

dition at z =

d and coincides with it for all z <

d.This is always the case,when wake

waves are described as the product of the two functions from separate arguments y and

z.Such a situation takes place in linear approximation [3],[11],[15].

The eq. (15) permits to search the solution with the separable variables

where k is a separation constant.The equations for ϕ1 and ϕ2 are:

ϕ(y, z) = ϕ1(y)ϕ2(z)

ϕ1′′ = k

Due to the symmetry of the problem the solution of equation (18) must be symmetric

on y; ϕ1′(y = 0) = 0 due to Ey = 0 at y = 0.The solution of the linear problem [9],[10] is

concentrated in the region of the ”trace”,falling outside it exponentially. Adopting the

same picture of the potential ﬂow for considering case too,the solution of eq. (18) is

which is valid for small values of y.It means that,the solution of eq. (15) in separable

arguments exists only for small values of y < b;

force proportional to ϕ2

The z2-dependense of the function a(y, z2) (and subsequently the z2-dependense of

The eq. (54) determines the dependense of a(y, z2) from z2.Eq. (54) is complicated

enough,it is a system of the ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations for Rea(y, z2) and Ima(y, z2).

The y-dependense of a(y, z2 = 0) is given by boundary conditions.

The eq. (54) simpliﬁes under the assumption that a(y, z2) is

a(y, z2) = Y (y)Z(z2)

(55)

where Z(z2 = 0) = 1,and Y (y) is known from the boundary conditions (48).Under (55)

The function ψ(y) is slowly varied on y,when

is reasonable to average the eq. (56) on y. Strikly speaking the need of such kind of

procedure indicates that assumption (55) is not in full appropriate,but practically can

work for slowly varying ψ(y).

An outlined approximate procedure,based on multiple scales method for solving basic

May be it is an indication of some new quality of the considered nonlinear poten-

In any case the

dependense on the longitudinal coordinate z,even in the ﬁrst approximation.

It seems,that subsequent experimental investigation of the dependense of the wake

wave amplitude on the driving bunch transverse and longitudinal charge distributions

could be useful.

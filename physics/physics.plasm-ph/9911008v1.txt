Within the kinetic approach velocity and charge distributions of grains in stationary dusty plasmas
are calculated and the relations between the eﬀective temperatures of such distributions and plasma
parameters are established. It is found that the eﬀective temperature which determines the velocity
grain distribution could be anomalously large due to the action of accelerating ionic bombarding force.
The possibility to apply the results obtained to the explanation of the increasing grain temperature
in the course of the Coulomb-crystal melting by reduction of the gas pressure is discussed.

Recently much attention has been payed to theoretical studies of various problems of dusty
plasma physics associated with grain dynamics and grain charging (formation and melting of
dusty crystals, inﬂuence of charging on eﬀective grain interaction, dust-acoustic wave excitation,
eﬀect of grain charging on ﬂuctuations and electromagnetic wave scattering in dusty plasmas,
etc.). In such studies it is convenient to treat the grain charge as a new variable (as was done
for the ﬁrst time in Ref. [1]). This makes it possible to statistically describe the grain charge
distribution on equal footing with the spatial and velocity grain distributions. Obviously, it
is very important to know what are the stationary (quasiequilibrium) grain distributions and
In spite of the fact that
what is the relation of these distributions to plasma parameters.
statistical descriptions of dusty plasmas have been already used in many papers, as far as
the authors of this letter know neither grain charge, nor velocity distributions for grains were
studied within a consistent kinetic approach. Usually, the problem is avoided by neglecting
the thermal dispersion of grain velocity and charge. In many cases this is a rather reasonable
approximation, but it could not be valid when the properties of the grain subsystem and its
dynamics are concerned.

The purpose of the present paper is to describe stationary velocity and charge distributions
of grains in dusty plasmas in the case of grain charging by plasma currents and to determine
the dependences of eﬀective temperatures on plasma parameters. We study dusty plasma
consisting of electrons, ions, neutral molecules and monodispersed dust particles (grains) as-
suming that every grain absorbs all encountered electrons and ions. Such collisions we deﬁne
as charging collisions. Collisions in which plasma particles do not touch the grain surface we
call Coulomb elastic collisions. Notice that the cross-sections of charging collisions are also
determined by the Coulomb forces along with the geometrical size of grains.

Using the microscopic equations for dusty plasmas and the relevant BBGKY-hierarchy [2]
it is possible to show that in the case of dominant inﬂuence of charging collisions the kinetic

physical arguments as was done in Refs. [3,4]. In fact, the right-hand part of Eq. (1) describes
the balance between the grains outcoming from the phase volume element and those incoming
to the same element due to charging collisions.

Charging collisions are inelastic and a part of the kinetic energy of the ions is transformed
into additional kinetic energy of the grains. This is the diﬀerence between the case under
consideration and conventional Brownian motion where the velocity distribution is described by
the temperature of the bombarding light particles. Eq. (14) shows that the eﬀective temperature
of thermal grain motion could be anomalously high at z
t. Physically it can be explained
by the decrease of the friction coeﬃcient with increase of grain charge

The reason is that the diﬀerence between the ﬂuxes of ions bombarding the grain surface
antiparallel to the grain motion and parallel decreases with the charge increase due to the

in parallel direction). The condition z = t

corresponds to the zero value of the friction force.

Eq. (3) and its solutions (5), (9), (15) were obtained under the assumption that the Coulomb
elastic collisions could be neglected. In order to take elastic collisions into consideration Eqs. (1),
(3) should be supplemented by the appropriate collision terms, for example, by the Landau, or
Balescu-Lenard collision integrals. We use the Balescu-Lenard collision integral in the Fokker-
Planck form which in the case under consideration (isotropic spatially homogeneous stationary
distribution) can be written as

where DkC(q, v) and βC(q, v) are the Fokker-Planck coeﬃcients related to Coulomb elastic
collisions (see, for example, [5], Chapter 8). With the accuracy up to the dominant logarithmic
terms (in this approximation Eq. (16) is reduced to the Landau collision term) such coeﬃcients

In Eqs. (16), (17) we again neglect the contribution of the transverse part of the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient which gives a correction to βC(q, v) of higher order in (mσ/mg) and we disregard the grain-
grain Coulomb collisions, assuming the grain density to be small (ng < ni(Zi/Zg)2(Sg/Si)1/2(Tg/Ti)).
We introduced also the Coulomb logarithms ln Λσ for each particle species. Usually these quan-
tities are estimated as ln Λσ = ln(kmax/kD), where kD = r−1

the inverse distance of closest approach between colliding particles,

(rLσ is Landau length). However,
in the case of plasma particle collisions with ﬁnite-size
grains this estimate could be invalid, since at rLσ < a the Coulomb logarithm will include the
contribution of collisions with particles reaching the grain surface, i.e. charging collisions.

An approximate modiﬁcation of Λσ is achieved by treating ln Λσ as a logarithmic factor
appearing in the momentum transfer cross-section for Coulomb collisions. In the case of ﬁnite
size grains one obtains the following logarithmic factor

where χmaxσ and χminσ are the scattering angles related to the minimal and maximal impact

from the condition that the distance of closest approach is equal to a implying

Rigorously speaking Eq. (16) and thus Eq. (22) are deﬁnitely valid in the case of weak

coupling plasmas (rLi ≪
(or, Landau) collision term. However, it is possible to expect that actually the domain of
validity of Eqs. (16), (22) is not too strongly restricted by such condition. This assumption is
in agreement with the direct calculations of the friction coeﬃcient (Coulomb collision frequency)
in terms of the binary collision cross-sections. Beside that, as it was shown in Ref. [6], in the
case of strong grain-plasma coupling the inﬂuence of the Coulomb collision is also small and the
kinetic equation is reduced again to Vlasov equation. This means that ﬂuctuation evolution
equations, which solutions determine the explicit form of the Balescu-Lenard collision term, are
the same as in the case of weakly coupled plasmas and thus Eq. (16) continues to be valid.

i.e. elastic collisions can produce a saturation of the grain temperature. However, in the case
of dominant inﬂuence of charging collision Teﬀ can be still anomalously large. This fact can be
used for a qualitative explanation of the experimentally observed grain temperatures which are
0.1 eV,
usually much higher than the ion temperature, Tg ≫
Tg ∼
40 eV). Finally, we point out that the obtained results can be modiﬁed also for the case
of a plasma with a neutral component. It is possible to introduce an additional collision term
along with the term (16). Since the collision integral describing elastic collisions of neutrals
with grains also can be represented in the Fokker-Planck form (it follows from the Boltzmann
collision integral) the presence of neutrals results in new additions to

According to Eq. (25) the eﬀective temperature increases with decreasing neutral density. The
inﬂuence of neutral density changes on the eﬀective temperature would be especially important

at 1
anomalous growth of Teﬀ. That is in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation
of melting of dusty crystals by reduction of the gas pressure [7,8].

The obtained results show that stationary velocity and charge grain distributions are de-
scribed by eﬀective temperatures diﬀerent from those of the plasma subsystem. These eﬀective
temperatures are determined by the competitive mechanics of collisions: grain-neutral colli-
sions and elastic Coulomb collisions result in the equalization of the eﬀective temperature to
the temperature of neutrals, or ions, respectively, while charging collisions can produce anoma-
lous temperature growth. That could be one of the main mechanisms of grain heating.

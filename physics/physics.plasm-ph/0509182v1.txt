Shaping of magnetic ﬂux surfaces is found to have a strong impact on turbulence and transport in
tokamak edge plasmas. A series of axisymmetric equilibria with varying elongation and triangularity,
and a divertor conﬁguration are implemented into a computational gyroﬂuid turbulence model. The
mechanisms of shaping eﬀects on turbulence and ﬂows are identiﬁed. Transport is mainly reduced
by local magnetic shearing and an enhancement of zonal shear ﬂows induced by elongation and
X-point shaping.

INTRODUCTION

It can be regarded as one of the most intriguing re-
sults of half a century in physics of hot magnetized plas-
mas, that in macroscopically stable equilibria the con-
ﬁnement is nevertheless determined by micro-scale insta-
bilities and ﬂuctuations, with transport of energy and
particles across magnetic ﬂux surfaces being dominated
by ubiquitous turbulence on small (gyro radius) scales
and low (drift) frequencies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This tur-
bulence is regulated by the formation of mesoscopic zonal
structures out of the turbulent ﬂows [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

.

Criteria for design of new magnetized plasma experi-
ments for fusion research like ITER are primarily based
on empirical scaling laws for the energy conﬁnement time
[14]. First-principle based transport models still require
reference to experimental scalings, and are validated
mainly only for core plasmas excepting the pedestal re-
gion [5]. An improved understanding of the underlying
turbulent dynamics and of its relation to design param-
eters, like the shape of the conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld, will
facilitate the development of advanced magnetic conﬁne-
ment experiments.

The plasma shape of a tokamak enters into conﬁne-
ment and transport modelling through parameters spec-
1 and an outboard side
ifying a vertical elongation κ
triangularity δ
0 that describe the deviation from a
simple circular torus. The design criteria of the ITER
plasma shape with κ = 1.7 and δ = 0.33 (at 95% ﬂux
surface) are based on a conservative regime that is well
established in present experiments [14]. More extreme
variations of ﬂux surface shaping were investigated with
the experiment TCV (Tokamak `a Conﬁguration Vari-
able) which is able to achieve conﬁgurations up to κ = 3
0.5 [15]. Experimental evidence suggests that
and δ =
large elongation is always beneﬁcial for local and global
energy conﬁnement, whereas the role of triangularity de-
pends also on the value of the plasma pressure gradient.

tion of the ﬂux tube for drift wave turbulence computations
winding around the torus along ﬁeld lines is here locally in-
tersecting the outer midplane of the plasma edge.

An important task for computational plasma physics
is to determine the eﬀects of ﬂux surface shaping on tur-
bulence and transport by ﬁrst-principle direct numerical
simulation. Shaping eﬀects are complicated even for ap-
parently simple circular equilibria [16], and eﬀorts to per-
form modelling for edge plasmas most often incorporate
technically complicated prescriptions in an inﬂexible way
[17]. An advantageous way to explore shaping is through
the use of a covariant metric in a model with Cartesian
topology [18, 19], but even then it was found that the use
of experimental geometry, while most realistic for mod-
elling purposes, may not be helpful to theoretical under-
standing, and hence standard “kappa-delta” models were
used [20]. In attempt to understand the eﬀects of stel-
larator geometry, a set of analytical forms were used for
the metric, varying each in turn to provide a small set of
steps from tokamak to stellarator geometry [21]. Forms

like this were also used to characterise the X-point eﬀects,
again making simple control tests tractable [22].

In the following, we report on the results of a more sys-
tematic series of “kappa-delta” tokamak conﬁgurations
with varying elongation and triangularity, and an ac-
tual ASDEX Upgrade [23] divertor conﬁguration with
the equilibrium code HELENA [24]. These are imple-
mented into the gyroﬂuid code GEM ([25], which is up-
dated from Ref. [20]) for computations of edge turbulence
and ﬂows. Speciﬁc eﬀects of ﬂux surface shaping on drift-
Alfv´en (DALF) and ion temperature gradient (ITG) tur-
bulence in the tokamak edge plasma are analysed and
compared, and the mechanisms of the coupling between
geometry and turbulence are identiﬁed. The emphasis is
on physical mechanism, which is complimentary to and
should also be helpful to the understanding of the more
experimentally oriented modelling eﬀorts.

It is found that turbulent transport ﬂuxes are reduced
by increasing ﬂux surface elongation κ. The inﬂuence
of triangularity δ is much weaker and generally also de-
pends on elongation and on a pressure shift. The geodesic
acoustic oscillation modes (GAM) and the overall turbu-
lence frequency spectra depend on ﬂux surface geometry.
An enhancement of zonal ﬂow amplitude in the spectra
by elongation and X-point shaping is found to be weak
in the DALF case and more pronounced in the ITG case.
The reduction of transport observed in our simulations
in shaped tokamak geometry is mainly a result of local
and global magnetic shear.

We begin in Section II with a brief review and discus-
sion of the role of sheared ﬂows in tokamak turbulence in
context of the toroidal ﬂux surface geometry. In section
III the gyroﬂuid electromagnetic model GEM for edge
turbulence computations is presented, and the ﬂux tube
representation of tokamak geometry within a GEM tur-
bulence code is discussed in Section IV. Transport scal-
ings by elongation and triangularity, that are obtained
with this model, are presented in Section V. Resulting
frequency and wave number spectra in tokamak divertor
geometry are discussed in Section VI. Conclusions and
implications of the results are presented in Section VII.

II. THE ROLE OF SHEARED FLOWS IN
TOKAMAK TURBULENCE

One of the main requirements for successful perfor-
mance of fusion experiments is the prospect of operation
in a high conﬁnement H-mode [26, 27, 28]. The forma-
tion of a characteristical transport barrier in magnetically
conﬁned toroidal H-mode plasmas is closely related to
the presence of a radially varying electric ﬁeld near the
last closed ﬂux surface [27, 29]. A radial electric ﬁeld,
Er, gives rise to a perpendicular E-cross-B (ExB) ﬂow
B. If Er varies with
through the relation vE = (c/B2)E
r, then this ﬂow is sheared, and this ﬂow shear is what
is invoked to explain the transport barrier [27, 29, 30].
The ﬂow shear (vorticity) is expected to suppress tur-

×

bulent transport either by shearing the eddies apart [31]
or by simply tilting them so that their Reynolds-stress
interaction with the vorticity layer tends towards energy
transfer out of the eddies and into the ﬂow [32]. Neo-
classical equilibrium eﬀects can also produce these shear
layers [33, 34]. As opposed to these mean ExB ﬂows, the
ﬂuctuating zonal ﬂows in direct interaction with the tur-
bulence have also been observed in tokamak edge regions
[35].

The transition between states of low (L) plasma con-
ﬁnement to the high (H) conﬁnement regime featuring
such an edge transport barrier is up to now not satis-
factorily described by any of the existing ﬁrst-principle
theories [36]. The notion that generation of zonal ﬂows
by direct drive of the turbulence can act to self-regulate
by suppressing the driving turbulent vortices has lead to
the development of predator-prey type bifurcation mod-
els that are able to describe speciﬁc characteristics of the
L-H transition (see e.g. [37]). Early computations based
on the resistive-g [38] and collisional drift wave [39] mod-
els found self-generated sheared ﬂows which could be ar-
gued as an L-H transition trigger. However, more recent
models in more comprehensive treatment of the toroidal
geometry and also the full range of scales of motion do
not ﬁnd this [20]. The phenomenology of these self con-
sistent zonal ﬂows receives wide interest [11, 12, 13], but
they serve as a moderator of the turbulence rather than
a suppression mechanism, as the energetic interactions
with not only the pressure but also magnetic parts of the
equilibrium tend to place each part of the overall dynami-
cal system, which naturally includes the ﬂows themselves
[40].

After the initial discovery of the H-mode in the divertor
experiment ASDEX [26] it has been found in numerous
large tokamaks around the world that the presence of
a divertor (originally designed to improve the impurity
exhaust) signiﬁcantly enhances the prospect of reaching
this state [41]. However, up to now both the transition
models as well as the numerical simulations have relied
mainly on simpliﬁed representations of the plasma ge-
ometry. In our present work we investigate the eﬀects of
realistic ﬂux surface shaping on tokamak edge turbulence
using a gyroﬂuid model recently corrected for energy con-
servation properties [6, 25], thereby updating previous
gyroﬂuid results [20]. This provides a counterweight to
existing eﬀorts based on collisional ﬂuid equations and
associated numerical schemes which cannot treat the ion
gyroradius scales and therefore overestimate linear phe-
nomena based in the larger scales [17, 42]. The ion gy-
roradius necessarily enters because the dynamics is sen-
sitive to phenomena in the range of the spectrum with
perpendicular wavenumbers only slightly less than the
inverse of the drift scale (ρs, also called “ion sound gy-
roradius”), and with comparable ion and electron tem-
peratures ρs is commensurate with the ion gyroradius ρi
[6]. A schematic view of a shaped plasma cross section
including a ﬂux-tube section from turbulence computa-
tions is shown in Fig. 1.

Transport in a fusion edge plasma is dominated by
turbulent low-frequency drift wave motion that causes a
ﬂuid-like convection through ExB vortices in a plane per-
pendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld direction, acting in con-
cert with parallel coupling dynamics tending towards dis-
sipation [43, 44, 45]. In general this is both nonlinear and
electromagnetic [6, 7]. Toroidal compressibility of zonal
(ﬂux surface averaged) ExB ﬂows opens channels in the
nonlinear dynamics of the vortex-ﬂow interaction that
strongly aﬀect the ﬂow energetics [46, 47]. The origin of
the compression is the geodesic curvature of the magnetic
ﬁeld lines. The ﬂow is thereby coupled with poloidally
asymmetric pressure sidebands which are consumed by
the turbulence and global Alfv´en or parallel ﬂow dynam-
ics. This energetics was given in Ref. [47] and the various
coupling eﬀects throughout the ﬂow/equilibrium system
were analysed in Refs. [40, 48], and the sensitivity of
the turbulence to the geodesic energy transfer eﬀect was
explored using an additional scaling parameter for the
strength of its coupling [49].

This geodesic transfer mechanism represents a restor-
ing loss channel for the zonal ﬂows, ultimately placing
them in statistical equilibrium with the turbulence, with
the Reynolds stress (spin-up) mechanism continuing to
operate. Since the latter acts on all frequencies, the
geodesic acoustic oscillation (GAM) [50] itself need not
be present for the geodesic transfer mechanism to oper-
ate. The net result of this is that turbulent transport
in 3D toroidal edge computations is found to be reduced
but not completely suppressed by the self-generated zonal
ﬂows. This geodesic transfer eﬀect was ﬁrst studied
for the case of a simple circular toroidal magnetic ﬁeld
[40, 47, 48], In the following we give both numerical evi-
dence and a physical picture of how plasma shaping and
the presence of a divertor via its modiﬁcation of plasma
geometry can inﬂuence the outcome of the gyroﬂuid tur-
bulence/ﬂow interaction.

III. THE GYROFLUID ELECTROMAGNETIC
MODEL GEM

The dynamical character of cross-ﬁeld ExB drift wave
turbulence in the edge region of a tokamak plasma is gov-
erned by electromagnetic and dissipative eﬀects in the
parallel response. The most basic drift-Alfv´en (DALF)
model to capture the drift wave dynamics includes non-
linear evolution equations of three ﬂuctuating ﬁelds: the
electrostatic potential ˜φ, electromagnetic potential ˜A||,
and density ˜n. The tokamak edge usually features a
more or less pronounced density pedestal, and the dom-
inant contribution to the free energy drive to the turbu-
lence by the inhomogeneous pressure background is thus
due to the density gradient. On the other hand, a steep
enough ion temperature gradient (ITG) in the edge does
not only change the turbulent transport quantitatively,
but adds new interchange physics into the dynamics. In
addition, more ﬁeld quantities have to be treated: par-

3

allel and perpendicular temperatures ˜Tk and ˜T⊥ and the
associated parallel heat ﬂuxes, for a total of six moment
variables for each species. Finite Larmor radius eﬀects
introduced by warm ions require a gyroﬂuid description
of the turbulence equations. Both the resistive DALF
and the ITG models can be covered by using the six-
moment electromagnetic gyroﬂuid model GEM [25], but
we will refer for the DALF model to its more economical
two-moment version [6].

The gyroﬂuid model is based upon a moment approxi-
mation of the underlying gyrokinetic equation. The ﬁrst
complete six-moment formulation was given for slab ge-
ometry [51], and later extended to incorporate toroidal
eﬀects [52] using a ballooning-based form of ﬂux surface
geometry [53]. Electromagnetic induction and electron
collisionality were then included to form a more general
gyroﬂuid for edge turbulence [20], with the geometry cor-
respondingly replaced by the version from the edge tur-
bulence work, which does not make ballooning assump-
tions and in particular represents slab and toroidal eigen-
mode types equally well and does not require radial pe-
riodicity [19]. Energy conservation considerations were
solidiﬁed ﬁrst for the two-moment version [6], and most
recently for the six-moment version [25]. This latter ref-
erence currently deﬁnes the GEM model, energetics, and
also the numerical techniques. The present paper uses
the six-moment equation set for each species (Eqs. 99-
104), induction and polarisation equations (Eqs. 89,92),
the zero gyroradius limit for electrons, the local model
with separate linear drive terms and Dirichlet bound-
ary conditions (Sec. IV A), Pad´e forms for gyroaveraging
operators (Sec. IV B), and the dissipation model and
numerical scheme (Secs. IV C-E), all with equation and
Section numbers from Ref. [25]. This is the standard
local form for the GEM code.

The ﬂux surface geometry of a tokamak enters into
the gyroﬂuid equations via the curvilinear generalisation
of diﬀerentiation operators and via inhomogeneity of the
magnetic ﬁeld strength B. The diﬀerent scales of equilib-
rium and ﬂuctuations parallel and perpendicular to the
magnetic ﬁeld motivate the use of ﬁeld aligned ﬂux co-
ordinates. The diﬀerential operators in the ﬁeld aligned
frame are the parallel gradient

The dynamical character of the system is further de-
termined by a set of parameters characterising the rel-
ative role of dissipative, inertial and electromagnetic ef-
fects in addition to the driving by gradients of density

and temperature.
In particular, we specify collision-
ality C = 0.51ˆǫ(νecs/L⊥)(me/Mi), magnetic induction
ˆβ = ˆǫ(4πpe/B2), electron inertia ˆµ = ˆǫ(me/Mi) and ion
inertia ˆǫ = (qR/L⊥)2, where L⊥ is the background gra-
dient scale length, and cs = pTe/Mi is the sound speed.
We use a standard set of edge parameters given as C = 5,
ˆβ = 1, ˆµ = 5 and ˆǫ = 18350.

The perpendicular scale length for the DALF model is
set as L⊥ = Ln to the density gradient length, and for
the ITG model as L⊥ = LT i = 0.5Ln = 0.5LT e to the ion
temperature gradient length, so that ηi = Ln/LT i = 2.
The ITG model has otherwise identical parameters. Ac-
curate experimental measurement of ion temperature
proﬁles in the tokamak pedestal region are only recently
being advanced and have previously been plagued by
large uncertainties. The present experimental knowledge
of edge parameters can thus be seen commensurate with
both the DALF and ITG model cases used here.

The computational domain is set to 64

256 nodes in
units of the drift scale ρs = (c/eB)√TeMi for (x, y) and
16 nodes in one ﬁeld line connection length (2πqR) in

The dimensions are chosen to appropriately account
for statistical isotropy in small scales in both perpendic-
ular directions with satisfactory spectral overlap, and for
an extended box size in the electron drift direction y to
achieve convergence. A box resolution down to ρs guar-
antees inclusion of all scales necessary for the nonlinear
dynamics that are esssential for the drift wave turbulence
characteristics.

IV. FLUX TUBE REPRESENTATION OF
TOKAMAK GEOMETRY

Tokamak equilibria are computed by solving the Grad-
Shafranov / L¨ust-Schl¨uter equation with the code HE-
LENA [24], implemented as described in Ref. [20]. A set
of nested ﬂux surfaces in straight ﬁeld line Hamada coor-
dinates (V, θ, ζ) is obtained by speciﬁcation of given ra-
dial proﬁles of pressure and rotational transform, and of
the shape of the bounding last closed ﬂux surface. These
Hamada coordinates are then transformed into a ﬁeld
aligned system and re-scaled into local ﬂux tube coor-
dinates (x, y, z) [18]. Global consistency in the parallel
boundary condition for one connection length is main-
tained [54]. A transformation of the coordinate y, which
signiﬁes the electron diamagnetic drift direction perpen-
dicular to the magnetic ﬁeld within ﬂux surfaces, is ap-
plied in order to avoid grid deformation by local magnetic
shear [19]. Otherwise, grid cells are sheared strongly in y
direction particularly near the X-point region, with ma-
lign consequences on nonlinear dynamics, especially in
the vorticity, that lead to a violation of the basic drift
wave character and overestimate linear MHD-like dynam-
ics. The diﬀerential operators are then expressed in terms
of the ﬂux tube coordinates: The curvature operator be-

Local and global magnetic shear are in general known
to have a damping inﬂuence on tokamak edge turbu-
x
lence [22], whereas geodesic curvature acting through
upon the axisymmetric component (ky = 0 components,
or “modes”) maintains the coupling for a loss channel
from zonal ﬂow energy eventually to turbulent vortices
[47]. Both mechanisms help to reduce turbulent trans-

A series of tokamak equilibria is constructed for elonga-
tion 1
0.4 with equal
proﬁles of pressure and rotational transform. The ﬂux
tube is chosen at a radial position r = pV /V0 = 0.95,
where V0 is the volume enclosed by the last closed ﬂux
surface. The background density proﬁle and rotational
transform for the GEM turbulence computations are lin-
earised within the bounds of the radial computational do-
main. We restrict our simulations for now to the closed
ﬁeld line region lying a few tens of ion gyroradii inside
from the separatrix, thus avoiding complications that oc-
cur by a divergent metric and associated grid deforma-
tion when the last closed ﬂux surface is approached in the
vicinity of an X-point. Ultimately, the goal of edge tur-
bulence simulations will be to combine suﬃciently well
resolved nonlocal drift wave computations with a repre-
sentation of the realistic ﬁeld line geometry crossing the
separatrix to the bounded scrape-oﬀ layer region.

When the plasma shape is thus varied, we have a par-
ticular interest in the eﬀects on ﬂuctuation time and spa-
tial scales, on the radial variation of ﬂux surface aver-
aged (zonal) ﬂows, and on turbulent transport. We ﬁrst
apply the ensemble of shaped tokamak equilibria to the
DALF model. The cross-ﬁeld turbulent electron trans-
port is determined by the ﬂux surface average of the
B convection of the ﬂuctuating density by
radial E
Fe =
yz, given in standard gyro-Bohm normalisa-
i
tion to necs(ρs/L⊥)2. The transport ﬂux Fe(t) is ﬂuc-
tuating in time, and for specifying a quantitative value
to it the time average over a suﬃciently long window,
that covers all relevant frequency scales, is taken during
the ﬁnal phase of simulations after all initial linear tran-
sients and spin-up of ﬂows and oscillations have reached
saturation.

As shown in Fig. 3, we ﬁnd that Fe is reduced to around
a third when elongation is increased from a circular cross
section to κ = 2. Scaling Fe against triangularity δ,
we ﬁnd in Fig. 4 that for κ = 1 the transport ﬂux is
independent from δ within the error bars given by the
deviation of the ﬂuctuating data from its time average.
For higher elongation κ = 2 the transport Fe is increased
from the normalised value of 0.20 to 0.28 by increasing
δ from 0 to 0.4. A good ﬁt to the transport data in the
DALF model within ﬂuctuation error bars is obtained by

where F1,0 = F (κ = 1, δ = 0). This reduction of transport
by elongation can be related to three diﬀerent causes:

(1) Increase of local and global magnetic shear (mag-
netic shear damping), (2) reduction of curvature drive
(interchange coupling), and (3) an enhancement of
sheared zonal ﬂows (geodesic transfer).

In Section VI we will present results showing that the
eﬀect of ﬂow shear enhancement by a weakening of the
geodesic transfer mechanism is insigniﬁcant for DALF
parameters. Also for these resistive electromagnetic edge
parameters, the interchange dynamics in the normal cur-
vature forcing is acting more as a catalyst than as a drive
mechanism for the turbulence, with only weak balloon-
ing of the ﬂuctuating quantities observed. On the other
hand, it has been established that local magnetic shear
by ﬂux surface deformation has a strong damping inﬂu-
ence on tokamak edge turbulence: comparing the case of
a simple circular torus (with global shear only) to a case
where the local magetic shear structure is typical of a
shaped tokamak (but the curvature properties are those
of a circular torus), a reduction of transport to around a
half was found [22]. Moreover, the eﬀective topological
global shear (deﬁned, e.g., in Eq. 29 of Ref. [54]) is also
increased by ﬁnite aspect ratio and elongation, but is not
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by moderate triangularity (δ < 0.6
or so). It can thus be argued, that the major mechanism

We now include ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven

κ−2.6 and Fn

When displaying heat and particle transport in relation
to elongation and triangularity now for the ITG model,
κ−2.3.
we ﬁnd in Fig. 5 a scaling of Qi
The reduction by elongation is thus stronger than for
the DALF model. One evident mechanism for this in-
creased reduction in the ITG case is the weakening of
the interchange drive of the ITG instability acting via
y, which is slightly reduced by
the normal curvature
elongation in the ballooning region of the ﬂux tube (com-
pare Fig. 2). In contrast to DALF dyanmics, the ITG
turbulence is strongly driven by “unfavourable” normal
curvature, leading to a pronounced ballooning character
of the ﬂuctuations, as shown in Fig. 7.

K

We ﬁnd as an additional mechanism in the ITG case
a signiﬁcant weakening of the geodesic transfer mecha-
x, which is discussed in the following
nism mediated by
section.

K

Similar as in the DALF case, both heat and particle
transport are slightly increasing with higher triangularity
for an elliptical cross section (κ = 2) in Fig. 6, while for
small κ no inﬂuence from triangularity is observed within
the ﬂuctuation error bars.

Summarising the results of this section on the inﬂu-
ence of ﬂux surface shaping on turbulent transport for
diﬀerent edge parameters, we ﬁnd that the main contri-
bution to transport reduction in both the DALF and ITG
regimes is magnetic shear damping by elongation.

Shear ﬂow enhancement by the reduced geodesic trans-
fer mechanisms is found to be relatively weak in the
DALF case, but is becoming relevant in the ITG model,
as can bee seen from analysing the wave number and
frequency spectra discussed in the next section.

For ﬁxed gradients, the local diﬀusivity is proportional
to the transport and thus to the roughly inverse quadratic
scaling with κ given above. Global transport across an
entire magnetic ﬂux surface can in principle be obtained
by integration of the local transport coeﬃcients, that
takes the variation of surface area with elongation into
account.

curvature term does also accordingly scale the geodesic
acoustic frequency: stronger elongation shifts the GAM
resonance frequency in the spectrum closer to the zero-
frequency zonal ﬂow. The same argument, now applied
y, also accounts for a κ−1
to the normal curvature term
scaling of the (interchange) drift wave frequency.

For DALF parameters used in our computations, the
GAM peak does not protrude very distinctly but can still
be identiﬁed on the ﬂat top of the spectra. In Fig. 8 the
discrete Fourier transform spectrum ˜φ(ω) for a measure-
ment of ˜φ at a local point in the centre of the xyz-domain
is shown: the spectrum below the GAM resonance is
mostly ﬂat except for the distinct zonal ﬂow peak at
ω = 0. The higher frequency part shows a typical ω−α
cascade structure, where the exponent α changes around
the drift frequency ˆω
1, which for our choice of edge
parameters coincides also with the Alfv´en frequency.

in edge turbulence computations in Ref. [18], where the
dependence of transport on ˆβ was established:
it was
found that the onset of MHD ballooning mode turbu-
lence is prevented for typical tokamak edge parameters
due to the shaping eﬀects in realistic geometry, and the
nature of transport is still basically of the drift-Alfv´en
wave character.

The AUG model has, for the present ﬂux tube position,
properties relevant to the turbulence dynamics that are
in some aspects in between those of up-down symmetric
conﬁgurations with κ = 1.6 and 2.0. Transport in the
AUG model is for DALF parameters found to be reduced
to Fe = 0.5 compared to Fe = 0.9 for the circular torus.

A reduction of geodesic curvature by elongation and
X-point shaping might be expected to lead to a weak-
ening of the geodesic transfer coupling mechanism for
energy from zonal ﬂows to GAMs [49]. This can be anal-
ysed by comparing the ﬂux surface averaged vorticity
for the conﬁgurations of the cir-

thus represents the radial shearing of zonal ﬂows, which is

In the DALF case, the cumulative amplitude of the
components in the radial spectrum of ﬂow shear
/ΓN
i
is the same within ﬂuctuation error bars for AUG geome-
try as for the circular torus. The lowest kx component in
these spectra, which is found to be stronger in the AUG
case, makes up for only approximately 8% of the total
vorticity. The spectra are shown in Fig. 10. Flow shear
in the DALF case thus is not signiﬁcantly enhanced by
ﬂux surface shaping. Also the amplitude of zonal ﬂows
in the DALF frequency spectra in Fig. 8 is found to be
comparable for circular and shaped conﬁgurations. The
reduction of turbulent edge transport is in this case there-
fore mainly a result of the local magnetic shear eﬀect [22].
In the ITG case, the ﬂow shear rate deduced from the
kx spectra of zonal vorticity is cleary higher in all compo-
nents for the AUG tokamak than for the circular torus,
as can be seen in Fig. 11. The cumulative amplitude in
the spectra is by 70% higher in AUG geometry than in
simple torus geometry. Flux surface shaping introduced
by elongation and X-point shaping clearly enhances ﬂow
shear signiﬁcantly for ITG edge parameters. The zonal
ﬂow amplitude in Fig. 9 is also by a factor of three larger
in the elongated conﬁguration.

This shear ﬂow enhancement contributes to the over-
all turbulent transport reduction by elongation, as has
been discussed in section V, in addition to the eﬀects of
magnetic shear damping and the reduction of interchange
drive. The detailed relative importance of these three
mechanisms may however change with varying plasma
parameters.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have discussed the eﬀects of ﬂux surface shaping on
tokamak edge turbulence and ﬂows. Elongation strongly
reduces the turbulent transport, whereas triangularity
was found to have only weak (transport enhancing) in-
ﬂuence. Two regimes of edge plasma parameters were
studied: an electromagnetic resistive drift wave (DALF)
case, and the (ITG) case with an additional ion temper-
ature gradient of ηi = 2.

The scaling of local transport is roughly with the in-
verse square of elongation, showing a stronger reduction
for ITG parameters than for DALF parameters. The ITG
result is consistent with earlier ﬁndings with the previous
version of the GEM model [20].

The mechanisms of ﬂux surface shaping eﬀects on tur-
bulence have been discussed. The major cause for trans-

port reduction by elongation is damping of turbulence
by stronger local magnetic shear at the upper and lower
parts of the torus on top of increased global magnetic
shear. The supervening reduction of the interchange
drive by a lower normal curvature has an additional tur-
bulence reduction eﬀect in particular for ITG parameters,
where the interchange drive is slightly weakend. In the
ITG case a signiﬁcant enhancement of zonal ﬂow shear
by elongation and X-point shaping further contributes to
transport reduction. The shear ﬂow eﬀect is on the other
hand found to be negligible for DALF parameters.

Both the DALF and ITG parameter regimes used in
our computations seem consistent with the presently still
poor experimental knowledge on edge ion temperature
proﬁles, though this situation is rapidly improving [55].
It can be assumed that additional core plasma heating,
e.g. by neutral beam injection (NBI) used in particu-
lar for obtaining the transition to an H-mode, is both
increasing the ion temperature at the pedestal top and
the ion temperature gradient in the overall edge pedestal
region. Based on our results, the shaping of tokamak
ﬂux surfaces by elongation and by the additional pres-
ence of an X-point like in AUG is expected to facilitate
an enhancement of zonal ﬂows when the role of the ion
temperature gradient dynamics is pronounced by addi-
tional heating.

It can be expected that this enhancement of zonal ﬂows
found for ITG parameters is even more pronounced for

9

more strongly shaped ﬂux surfaces nearer to the separa-
trix. Preliminary results suggest that such initial radially
local ﬂows have the ability to spread over wider regions of
the pedestal in simulations with global proﬁle evolution.
Some L-H transition theories include zonal ﬂows as a
trigger mechanism to induce the transition to a sustained
mean shear ﬂow. The enhancement of zonal ﬂows by
ﬂux surface and X-point shaping in the presence of ion
temperature gradient steepening may oﬀer an additional
explanation for the observation that H-mode access in
tokamak experiments is facilitated by the presence of a
divertor.

The possibility to obtain a conﬁnement transition
within ﬁrst principle computations of edge turbulence
will thus have to be studied with a code that includes
full temperature dynamics, realistic ﬂux surface geome-
try, global proﬁle evolution, and a coupling of edge and
SOL regions including realistic sheath boundary condi-
tions, while in addition it maintains suﬃcient grid reso-
lution, grid deformation mitigation, and energy plus en-
strophy conservation in the vortex/ﬂow system.

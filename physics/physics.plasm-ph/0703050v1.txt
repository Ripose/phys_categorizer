Abstract

The generation of large-scale zonal ﬂows by small-scale electrostatic

drift waves in electron temperature gradient(ETG) driven turbulence model
is considered. The generation mechanism is based on the modulational
instability of a ﬁnite amplitude monochromatic drift wave. The threshold
and growth rate of the instability as well as the optimal spatial scale of
zonal ﬂow are obtained.

1 Introduction

It is now an established fact that zonal ﬂows (ZFs) (i.e., azimuthally symmet-
ric modes that depend only on the radial coordinate) play a crucial role in
regulating the nonlinear evolution of drift-wave instabilities in tokamaks, and
consequently, the level of turbulent transport [1, 2]. In particular, it is known
that triggering of the L-H transition in tokamaks is related to the emergence
of ZFs in the poloidal direction which suppresses the ﬂuctuations and build up
a barrier to the turbulent transport. It is widely thought that zonal ﬂows are
generated by the modulational instability of the turbulent spectrum of electro-
static drift-wave perturbations [3, 4]. Under this, two possible regimes can be
indicated: (a) when the spectrum is broad, integration over all wavenumbers
yields a resonant instability; (b) when the drift wave spectrum is narrow, one
can consider the instability of a monochromatic drift wave and the instability is
of the modulational type. In the latter case, standard schemes of the four-wave
interaction can be applied [5–7].

Ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes and trapped electron modes are gen-
erally regarded as the main candidates to explain the anomalous transport, but,

1

recently, there has been the growth of interest in electron temperature gradi-
ent driven turbulence, produced by the electron temperature gradient driven
modes [8–11]. This is related to the fact that the study of interaction of ETG
modes with large-scale motions like ZFs or streamers (radially elongated vortex-
type structures) is important for understanding the electron thermal transport
within an internal transport barriers, when ITG turbulence is suppressed by
E
B shear ﬂow [12]. Note, that there is an important diﬀerence between
the ITG and ETG models: in the ETG model we have the Boltzmann ion re-
sponse for both waves and zonal ﬂows, while the electron response to zonal ﬂow
perturbations is hydrodynamic in the ITG model [1, 13].

×

In the present paper we consider the excitation of ZFs by a ﬁnite amplitude
monochromatic drift wave in the framework of ETG turbulence model. The
corresponding ETG mode is assumed to be stable, i. e. we consider the region
below the marginal stability boundary. We derive a set of coupled equations
describing the nonlinear interaction of drift ETG modes and ZFs and show that
ZFs can be readily excited by the modulational instability.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. 2 a set of normalized ﬂuid
equations describing ETG drift modes – ZF interaction is introduced. In Sec.
3, the nonlinear dispersion relation is obtained and the modulational instability
growth rate behavior is analyzed. Sec. 4 contains summary and conclusions.

2 Model equations

Assuming a slab two-dimensional geometry, charge quasineutrality and the adi-
abatic ion responce, we consider the following simpliﬁed model describing cur-
vature driven ETG turbulence in the inviscid limit (see, e.g. [9]):

3 Modulational instability of ETG drift waves

and zonal ﬂow generation

Assuming that the zonal ﬂow varies on much larger timescale than ETG drift
waves do, the standard decomposition into fast (
..., ETG drift wave related)
and slow (
..., zonal ﬂow related) motions can be performed. The perturbations
of electrostatic potential ϕ and plasma pressure P are presented as a sum of
fast and slow parts

When obtaining the system (4) - (7), we have assumed that the mean ﬁeld is
described by the same model equations as the ﬂuctuations, but is driven by the
Reynolds stress. This follows from the assumption of adiabatic ion response
for the ﬂow as well as ﬂuctuations, which is valid for the ETG modes. We
describe the interaction between drft ETG modes and ZF in terms of a four-
wave coupling scheme, i.e., each ﬂuctuation is taken to be coherent. Then, the
ETG drift waves are considered as a superposition of the pump wave (~k, ωk)
and two sidebands (~k±, ω±), i.e.,

Generally, ZF dispersion which follows from the equation (25) is a fourth-order
in Ω, which, in principle, allow one to treat it analytically. We present below
an analysis of nonlinear dispersion relation for the case when the ETG drift
mode does not have the k-component in the direction of inhomogeneity, i.e. for
= 0 and found that inclusion of nonzero kx
kx = 0. We also treated the case kx
does not introduce any qualitative change to the growth rate behavior except
for the decrease of it’s magnitude. Besides that, it turns out that in all studied
cases the pump wave with kx = 0 ensures the largest growth rate in the explored
region of linear stability.

For the case kx = 0, the nonlinear dispersion relation is reduced to the

The analysis of the growth rate (27) shows that the modulational instability
can be excited (γ > 0) only above some threshold in the input power ϕ2

threshold is a function of the scales k and q of ETG drift wave and zonal ﬂow.

wavenumber q approaches k, the instability threshold goes to inﬁnity, as it is
illustrated in Figure 1.

Present analysis is restricted to the case when the pump ETG drift wave, as
well as both sidebands are linearly stable, i.e. for each value of r parameter, all
considered scales k and q are conﬁned in the (k, q) - plane inside the circle

Thus, the modulational instability parameter range under consideration is lim-
ited. Instability domain in (k, q)-plane is outlined in Figure 2. It is clear that
circle shrinks to the origin when r approaches 1/4.

In the Figure 3, modulational instability growth rates are plotted as a func-
tions of k and q scales of ETG drift wave and zonal ﬂow respectively for diﬀerent
values of the parameter r and pump wave amplitude ϕ2
0. Dashed lines in the
contour planes conﬁne the considered instability domain (schematically outlined
in Figure 2). Outside the circle given by the equation (29), the growth rate was
artiﬁcially forced to zero due to linear stability requirements. It is seen that as
the parameter r grows, the region of instability contracts and the growth rate
magnitude goes down. In all studied cases, the maximum growth rate always
corresponded to the (k, q) - pair from the circle (29) so that for the ﬁxed k there
is an optimal (i.e. corresponding to the maximum growth rate) scale q of the
generated ZFs. With the increase of a pump wave amplitude, the growth rate
as well as the instability domain increases, however in the region of physically
appropriate values of ϕ2
0, no qualitative changes to the growth rate behavior
were found.

4 Summary and conclusions

In the present paper, we have considered the nonlinear interaction between drift
waves and ZFs in subcritical ETG turbulence. We have derived a set of equa-
tions describing the dynamics of nonlinearly coupled ETG modes and ZFs. As-
suming that the spectrum of ﬂuctuations is suﬃciently narrow, we analyzed the
obtained set of equations in terms of a four-wave coupling scheme and obtained
the nonlinear dispersion relation. We have shown that this dispersion relation
predicts the modulational instability of a ﬁnite amplitude monochromatic drift
wave. Thus, ETG drift ﬂuctuations can be destabilized by the four-wave in-

teraction mechanism with simultaneous generation of ZFs. We have found the
threshold of the modulational instability and the dependence of the instabil-
ity growth rate on spatial scales of ETG drift waves and excited ZFs. For the
ﬁxed wavenumber of the ETG mode k, the growth rate always has a maximum
which is achieved for some intermediate value of ZF wavenumber q. When the
amplitude of the ETG pump wave increases (as well as when the parameter r
decreases), the region of modulational instability widens towards small k-scales.
The present results thus demonstrate that ZFs in subcritical ETG turbulence
can be excited by the modulational instability.

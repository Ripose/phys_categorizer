Recent tokamak experiments employing oﬀ-axis, non-inductive current drive have found that a
large central current hole can be produced. The current density is measured to be approximately
zero in this region, though in principle there was suﬃcient current drive power for the central current
density to have gone signiﬁcantly negative. Recent papers have used a large aspect-ratio expansion
to show that normal MHD equilibria (with axisymmetric nested ﬂux surfaces, non-singular ﬁelds,
and monotonic peaked pressure proﬁles) can not exist with negative central current. We extend
that proof here to arbitrary aspect ratio, using a variant of the virial theorem to derive a relatively
simple integral constraint on the equilibrium. However, this constraint does not, by itself, exclude
equilibria with non-nested ﬂux surfaces, or equilibria with singular ﬁelds and/or hollow pressure
proﬁles that may be spontaneously generated.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Tokamaks with reversed central magnetic shear (and
thus low core current density) are of interest for at least
two reasons: 1) internal transport barriers associated
with reduced turbulence are often observed in them, lead-
ing to improved energy and particle conﬁnement; and
2) they are the natural result of high beta operation
and high bootstrap current fraction used to reduce non-
inductive current drive requirements for steady state op-
eration. Both of these features could make reversed mag-
netic shear operation attractive for a tokamak reactor.

Recent experiments on JET1,2,3,4 and JT-60U5,6 have
pushed the core current density to very low values us-
ing oﬀ-axis, non-inductive current drive. Large central
current holes (regions of nearly zero current density) are
produced because oﬀ-axis, non-inductive current drive in
the same direction as the Ohmic current induces a back
electromotive force inside the non-inductive current drive
radius that decreases the core current density.

An interesting feature of current hole discharges is that
the core current density is approximately zero (within
Motional Stark Eﬀect diagnostic measurement errors),
even though there is often suﬃcient current drive power
that the core current could in principal go signiﬁcantly
negative2,3 (negative relative to the direction of the to-
tal plasma current). Recent non-linear toroidal resistive
MHD simulations2,7 predict that current hole discharges
undergo rapid n = 0 reconnection events (axisymmetric
sawteeth) that clamp the core current near zero. More
generally, this reconnection occurs whenever the current
density proﬁle is such that the rotational transform, ι,
goes to zero on any surface in the plasma (this includes
the case where the current density on-axis is positive, but
the current proﬁle goes suﬃciently negative somewhere
oﬀ-axis that the total current enclosed by some ﬂux sur-

face vanishes). Reduced MHD simulations in cylindrical
geometry have also shown that n = 0 resistive kink insta-
bilities can clamp the core current density at zero when
it attempts to go negative.8 Breslau et al.7 and Stratton
et al.2 stated that a second-order, large aspect ratio ex-
pansion of the MHD equations indicates that a normal
toroidal equilibrium is not possible if ι crosses through 0
at some radius. (They also stated that a more general
proof is needed, which we provide here.) A recent paper
by Chu and Parks9 used a second order aspect ratio ex-
pansion to prove that a normal equilibrium with a peaked
pressure proﬁle is not possible with negative core current.
They extended the analysis to provide matching condi-
tions at the boundary of a central region with no current
and no pressure gradient, showing explicitly that current
hole equilibria are theoretically possible (with zero, but
not negative, current).

This paper extends some of these results to arbitrary
aspect ratio, employing a relatively simple constraint
based on a version of the virial theorem to show that
a “normal” toroidal MHD equilibrium (with axisymmet-
ric nested ﬂux surfaces around a single magnetic axis,
non-singular continuous ﬁelds, and a monotonic peaked
pressure proﬁle) is not possible with negative core cur-
rent. Or more generally, a normal equilibrium is not
possible if the toroidal current enclosed by any ﬂux sur-
face goes negative relative to the direction of the total
plasma current, so that there is an ι = 0 surface some-
where in the plasma where the poloidal ﬁeld vanishes (the
null surface). Though the starting point of this analysis
is based on well-known equations, they are often special-
ized to large aspect ratio or simpliﬁed geometry, while
the present analysis is more general.

However, the virial constraint does not necessarily
eliminate the possibility of more exotic equilibria, such
as with non-nested ﬂux surfaces with islands, or with sin-
gular ﬁelds and/or oﬀ-axis peaks in the pressure proﬁles
that may be spontaneously generated by the plasma near
the null surface. Some examples are considered here. In
this paper we investigate the consequences of only one in-

tegral constraint on equilibria, while there can be other
constraints that further limit the types of theoretically
possible or experimentally realizable equilibria9.

The non-existence of normal equilibria with negative
core current, and/or the rapid axisymmetric sawteeth
that are predicted to occur if the enclosed current goes
negative, may also explain the results of other experi-
ments, such as the low eﬃciency seen in some electron
cyclotron counter current drive experiments6,10.

One common use of the virial theorem is to take the inner
product of this equation with the position vector x and
integrate over all space to show that an isolated MHD
equilibrium can not exist by itself (unless there are phys-
ical coils or gravity to provide overall force balance).11,12
Here we use a version of the virial theorem that can be
used to derive the Shafranov shift13, by focusing on radial
force balance of axisymmetric equilibria in cylindrical co-
ordinates (R, Z, φ). Taking the inner product of Eq. (1)
with R = R ˆR, the radial vector in cylindrical geometry,

there can be two surfaces with the same value of ψ in

to choose another ﬂux surface label ρ, such as based on
the enclosed volume or toroidal ﬂux, to maintain mono-
tonic labeling.]
If the toroidal current near the mag-
netic axis is in the opposite direction as the total plasma
current, then the poloidal ﬁeld must reverse direction
somewhere and there must be a null surface on which
the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld is everywhere zero, as shown
in Fig. 1. Another way to see this is to note that the
poloidal ﬁeld is related to the enclosed toroidal current
Bpol = (∂ψ/∂ρ)

∂ψ/∂ρ = 0 on any ﬂux surface that encloses zero

with ﬁnite energy. [All of these sketches are intended only to

Since the last two terms are positive deﬁnite, the only
way this equation can possibly be satisﬁed is if the pres-
sure at this ﬂux surface, p, is larger than the volume-
averaged pressure inside that ﬂux surface,
. I.e., the
i
pressure proﬁle must be hollow, and can’t monotonically
decrease with increasing ρ as usual pressure proﬁles do.
This is in agreement with the result of Chu and Parks9,
who also found that a normal equilibrium with a nega-
tive central current is not possible if the pressure proﬁle
is monotonically decreasing. These earlier results used a
second-order large aspect ratio ordering while our deriva-
tion is valid for arbitrary aspect ratio.
In other ways,
their calculation goes beyond ours, as they have inves-
tigated additional constraints that can further limit the
class of accessible equilibria.

III. POSSIBLE ALTERNATE SOLUTIONS

Here we consider several possible alternate solutions
for satisfying force balance in equilibria. Each diﬀers
from “normal” equilibria in a diﬀerent way.

The argument in the previous section applies rigor-
ously only for nested ﬂux-surfaces where the ﬁelds are
continuous and ﬁnite. Within the framework of ideal
MHD, in principle there could be a singular poloidal
Bpol = 0 so
ﬁeld on a ﬂux surface such that
that this surface includes zero toroidal current, but
pol/(8π) is still ﬁnite and can contribute to
Eq. (4) so that integrated force balance can be satisﬁed.

giving a ﬁnite contribution to the second term of Eq. (4).
Although Bpol is becoming inﬁnite at some point on the
ﬂux surface, it is an integrable singularity containing a
ﬁnite amount of energy, and so could formally be con-
sidered as an admissible solution of ideal MHD. Since
the spacing between two nearby ﬂux surfaces labeled by
poloidal ﬂux ψ1 and ψ2 is given by ∆
ψ
|
(except where second derivatives have to be considered),
there will be ﬂux surfaces with ﬁnite separation at some
places which will approach one another at the singular
point where
. The topology of this conﬁgura-
tion is illustrated in Fig. 2. [This sketch is intended only
to illustrate the topology of a possible solution which sat-
isﬁes the integral force balance constraint, Eq. (4). An
actual detailed solution that would satisfy force balance
locally at all points is left for future work.] Note that not
only is the poloidal ﬁeld inﬁnite at the singular point, it
must also ﬂip signs from +
in the limit as the
∞
singular point is approached radially from opposite direc-
tions. Of course this conﬁguration is strongly suscepti-
ble to magnetic reconnection when resistivity is included,
consistent with the interpretation of rapid reconnection
observed in simulations2,7. If ﬁnite resistivity is included,
then the singularity in the ﬁeld is smoothed out and loss
of equilibrium can help drive reconnecting ﬂows.

Another possible way of satisfying integrated force bal-
ance with negative central current, while keeping the ﬁeld
ﬁnite and continuous,
is if the ﬂux surfaces are non-
nested. An example is shown in Fig. 3, which is sim-
ilar to the intermediate conﬁgurations observed during
some toroidal simulations of axisymmetric reconnection
in negative central current plasmas (for example, Fig. 11
of Ref. 2, though in other cases they see islands with

higher poloidal mode numbers). This case has two ax-
isymmetric islands and the poloidal ﬁeld is ﬁnite almost
everywhere (except at the two magnetic axes and at the
X-point) and so in principle can be arranged to give a
negative contribution to the second term of Eq. (4) to
satisfy integrated force balance. This is related to the
role in a normal equilibrium of the Shafranov shift, which
provides a larger value of R2B2
pol on the outer part of a
ﬂux surface than on the inner part, so that the second
term in Eq. (4) is negative. The X-point of a non-nested
equilibrium might not be on the low-ﬁeld side, and an-
other possible equilibrium might be obtained by rotating
Fig. 3 by 180◦ and shifting the spacing between ﬂux sur-
faces so that the integral of R2B2
pol on the outer part of
the ﬂux surface is again larger than on the inner part.
One or the other of these conﬁgurations may be an un-
stable equilibrium and prefer to ﬂip to the other orienta-
tion. [Takizuka14 earlier proposed another possible non-
nested equilibria with negative central current, involving
(m = 2, n = 0) islands, while the example we discussed
here has an (m = 1, n = 0) island.]

· ∇

Another way of thinking about ideal MHD equilibria
is to modify the time-dependent ideal MHD equations to
include viscosity and parallel thermal conduction while
retaining the ideal Ohm’s law12. Since viscosity should
eventually damp the velocity u to zero, and parallel ther-
mal conduction will lead to B
p = 0, the dissipative
terms vanish in a stationary steady state and the solu-
tion is also an ideal MHD equilibrium. One can then start
with any arbitrary initial conﬁguration of the magnetic
ﬁeld (which can be assumed to be nested ﬂux surfaces)
with arbitrary initial proﬁles, as functions of toroidal ﬂux
Φ, for the rotational transform ι(Φ) and the adiabatic pa-
rameter µ(Φ) = p/nΓ (where p(Φ) is the pressure proﬁle,
n(Φ) is the density proﬁle, and Γ is the ratio of spe-
ciﬁc heats). Since this initial condition is not necessar-
ily an equilibrium, ﬂows will be driven and the plasma
will move about, perhaps oscillating for a while. But it
seems reasonable to assume that the viscosity will eventu-
ally damp out the oscillations and the plasma will settle
into an equilibrium conﬁguration while conserving ι(Φ)
and µ(Φ). (The motions are assumed to be constrained
to be axisymmetric to ﬁnd such an equilibria. This ap-
proach to equilibria of course does not address the issue
of stability, and these equilibria might then be unstable
to symmetry-breaking perturbations.)

This was the logic that motivated the ﬂux-conserving
tokamak equilibria concepts12 that showed that there is
formally no equilibrium limit on the pressure in a toka-
mak, since as the pressure increases, the Shafranov shift
and the current can also increase to provide suﬃcient
poloidal magnetic ﬁeld on the outboard side to provide
force balance.

Presumably this procedure would also ﬁnd an equi-
librium even if the rotational transform changed sign so
that there was a null ﬂux surface where ι = 0. In some
cases with certain initial conditions, it might be possible
for the plasma to spontaneously adjust ﬂux surfaces near

4

the null ι surface to produce a local peak in the pressure
proﬁle that can satisfy Eq. (5). [We have focussed on the
consequences of only one integral constraint that rules
out “normal” equilibria with negative central current,
and there can be other constraints that would further
limit the practical accessibility of such hollow pressure
equilibria9.] The more typical case is probably that the
equilibrium that is approached will have a singular struc-
ture, such as in Fig. 2, in order to satisfy Eq. (4). [This
is similar to studies showing that the nonlinear satura-
tion of an internal kink mode approaches a neighbouring
equilibrium state with singular currents15,16.] These sin-
gular or near-singular states will be subject to strong re-
connection if a small amount of resistivity is introduced,
and the change in topology may dominate what happens.
Realistic evaluations of what happens may depend on
fully including various dissipation mechanisms (thermal,
momentum, and particle anisotropic transport driven by
small scale turbulence and collisional eﬀects, as well as
resistivity, current drive, heating and loss mechanisms).
We leave detailed investigation of these issues to other
work.

V. SUMMARY

We have presented a relatively simple integral con-
straint on toroidally axisymmetric MHD equilibrium that
shows that a normal equilibrium (with nested magnetic
ﬂux surfaces, non-singular ﬁelds, and a peaked pressure
proﬁle that falls monotonically with radius) can not exist
if the toroidal current inside any ﬂux surface is negative
relative to the total plasma current. This generalizes pre-
vious results2,7,9 to arbitrary aspect ratio.

However, the integral constraint does not necessar-
ily prevent negative central current equilibria with non-
nested or singular magnetic ﬂux surfaces. Possible exam-
ples of this are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. A plasma with
nested ﬂux surfaces and negative central current that is
initially out of equilibrium could presumably move to-
wards an equilibrium, though it seems most likely that
this new equilibrium would have singular or near-singular

5

ﬁelds and thus would be subject to strong reconnection2,7
if ﬁnite resistivity is introduced, changing the topology.
There can also be other constraints that limit the acces-
sible class of alternate equilibria9. One might be able to
understand the structure of some of these possible solu-
tions in the vicinity of the null surface as a boundary layer
analysis of a shock-like solution. But a realistic evalua-
tion of such scenarios would require including ﬁnite cross-
ﬁeld transport, viscosity, resistivity, and FLR eﬀects. We
leave these issues to future work. Other interesting ques-
tions to consider are whether such “non-normal” MHD
equilibria are stable to ideal and/or resistive MHD modes
and/or are experimentally accessible.

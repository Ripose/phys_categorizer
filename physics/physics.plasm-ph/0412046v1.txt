In magnetic conﬁgurations with two or three q = 1 (with q being the safety factor) resonant
surfaces in a tokamak plasma, resistive magnetohydrodynamic modes with poloidal mode numbers
m much larger than 1 are found to be linearly unstable. It is found that these high-m double or
triple tearing modes signiﬁcantly enhance through nonlinear interactions, the growth of the m = 1
mode. This may account for the sudden onset of the internal resistive kink, i.e., the fast sawtooth
trigger. Based on the subsequent reconnection dynamics that can proceed without formation of
the m = 1 islands, it is proposed that high-m triple tearing modes are a possible mechanism for
precursor-free partial collapses during sawtooth oscillations.

The proﬁle of the safety factor q(r) (which measures
the magnetic ﬁeld line pitch) contains information about
the instability characteristics of magnetically conﬁned
plasmas in toroidal or helical systems with respect to
current-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabili-
ties. In particular, in the presence of magnetic surfaces
where q = 1, a mixing of the plasma inside these surfaces
was observed. This instability is thought to be closely
related to internal disruptions, generally known as saw-
tooth oscillations, which strongly aﬀect the quality of en-
ergy and particle conﬁnement. In view of the desired ap-
plication to thermonuclear fusion reactors such as ITER,
a detailed understanding of these internal large-scale in-
stabilities is necessary.

A heuristic model proposed by Kadomtsev [1] success-
fully explains overall phenomena associated with a full
sawtooth crash. In this model, a perturbation with helic-
ity h = m/n = 1 (m being the poloidal and n the toroidal
Fourier mode number), which is in resonance with the
closed ﬁeld lines on the q = 1 surface, quenches the hot
core region inside the q = 1 surface through magnetic
reconnection. This kind of relaxation, generally known
as the m = 1 internal resistive kink instability (in short,
the m = 1 mode) has been observed to exhibit an abrupt
onset, which is called a “fast trigger.” However, a satis-
factory explanation of this fast trigger is not yet known.
Another unresolved problem is the possibility of a par-
tial sawtooth collapse, where the m = 1 mode saturates
before the reconnection of the core is completed, so only
an annular (oﬀ-axis) region undergoes mixing [2].

During the evolution of a tokamak plasma subject to
sawtooth relaxation oscillations, multiple q = 1 resonant
surfaces may arise temporarily [3]. When this occurs
in conﬁgurations with a hollow current proﬁle (q0 > 1

with q0 being the q at the magnetic axis) q = 1 double
tearing modes (DTMs) can become unstable whereas, for
a centrally peaked current proﬁle (q0 < 1), q = 1 triple
tearing modes (TTMs) may arise [4, 5].

In this letter,

it is demonstrated that some of the
phenomena associated with the sawtooth oscillations in
tokamaks can be explained by the nonlinear evolution of
DTMs or TTMs. Using nonlinear numerical simulations,
it is shown that, in the presence of multiple q = 1 res-
onant surfaces, rapidly growing high-m DTMs or TTMs
can enhance the growth of the m = 1 mode and later
generate electromagnetic turbulence in the annular re-
gion surrounded by the q = 1 resonant surfaces. Based
on these observations, it is shown that the fast trigger of a
sawtooth crash as well as precursor-free partial collapses
during sawtooth relaxation oscillations can be accounted
for by the nonlinear evolution of TTMs.

The set of equations we use is the reduced magnetohy-
drodynamic (RMHD) equation in the zero-beta limit in
a cylindrical geometry. In normalized form the RMHD
model can be written as

∂tψ = [ψ, φ] − ∂ζφ − S−1
∂tu = [u, φ] + [j, ψ] + ∂ζ j + ν∇2

where ψ is the magnetic ﬂux function, φ the stream
function (electrostatic potential), j = −∇2
⊥ψ the ax-
ial current density and u = ∇2
⊥φ the vorticity, essen-
tially following the standard notation (cf., e.g., Ref. [6]).
The time t is normalized by the poloidal Alfv´en time
τHp (time scale for dynamics in an ideal magnetized
plasma) and the radial coordinate by the minor radius a
of the plasma column. The resistivity proﬁle is given by
ˆη(r) = j(r = 0, t = 0)/j(r, t = 0). As to the Lundquist
number SHp = τR/τHp (where τR = µ0/(η0a2) is the re-
sistive time scale and η0 the resistivity at r = 0) and
viscosity ν (normalized by a2/τHp), SHp = ν−1 = 106 is
used, unless stated otherwise. The constant source term
E0 compensates the resistive dissipation of the equilib-
rium current. Using a quasi-spectral code with a ﬁnite-

FIG. 2: Linear growth rate spectra of TTMs for the q proﬁle
given in Fig. 1 for the Lundquist numbers SHp = 106, 107 and
109 and constant Prandtl number P r = (SHpν)−1 = 1.

diﬀerence radial mesh, single helicity (h = m/n = 1,
0 ≤ m ≤ 127) nonlinear simulations of Eq. (1) and (2)
were performed with an initial condition corresponding
to a ﬂow-less equilibrium with perturbed ﬂux function
(ψm>0(t = 0) = 10−11, m = n). An ideally conduct-
ing wall was taken as the boundary condition. Although
the RMHD model encompasses only part of the phys-
ical eﬀects involved in sawtooth oscillations (cf., e.g.,
Refs. [2, 7, 8]), it suﬃces for the present purpose of fol-
lowing the fundamental dynamics of DTMs and TTMs.
The important new feature of linear instability that
is addressed here is the fact that conﬁgurations with
multiple q = 1 resonant surfaces in general possess a
broad spectrum of linearly unstable modes. Moreover,
the fastest growing mode often has a poloidal mode num-
ber m ∼ O(10). To show this, the q proﬁle shown in
Fig. 1 is employed, where three q = 1 resonant sur-

faces are present, at the radii rs1 < rs2 < rs3. By
evolving the linearized RMHD equations in time, spectra
of linear growth rates (i.e., dispersion relations) γlin(m)
were obtained as functions of m, as plotted in Fig. 2 for
Lundquist numbers SHp = 106, 107 and 109. Hereby the
Prandtl number P r = (SHpν)−1 has been kept equal to
unity. Clearly, a variation of SHp (while P r = 1) retains
the broadness of the spectrum and γmax = Max{γlin(m)}
is located at m > 1 in all cases.

The dependence of the spectrum γlin(m) on the dis-
tance between the q = 1 surfaces is most easily inves-
tigated by considering DTM conﬁgurations where two
q = 1 resonant surfaces are present, located at radii rs1
and rs2, a distance D12 = rs2 − rs1 apart. In Fig. 3 the
DTM growth rate spectra for proﬁles with D12 = 0.05,
0.1 and 0.2 are shown. While varying D12, the local
magnetic shears at the resonant radii, s1 = s(rs1) and
s2 = s(rs2), were not changed. It can be seen that the
narrower the inter-resonance region becomes, the more
the poloidal mode number of the fastest growing mode
shifts to larger values of m, and γmax increases. On the
other hand, the growth rate of the m = 1 mode hardly de-
pends on D12 and it becomes the fastest growing mode
for suﬃciently large values of D12. Similar results are
found for TTMs, whereby it is noted that TTMs tend to
peak at higher m with higher growth rates than DTMs
with similar Dij. The spectra shown in Figs. 2 and 3 con-
trast with that for the single tearing modes (STM), for
which the m = 1 mode is dominant and the modes with
higher m are usually linearly stable. Note that the broad
spectra of tokamak TTMs that were obtained here are
similar to those of tearing modes obtained by Dahlburg
and Karpen [9] for triple current sheets (TCS) in slab
geometry as a model for adjoining helmet streamers in
the solar corona.

It must be emphasized that the dispersion curves in
Fig. 2 show only the growth rate of the most unstable

mode for each m. However in general, for a given m there
are up to three unstable TTM eigenmodes, each of which
being associated with a resonant surface. To illustrate
this, the radial structure of the eigenmodes for m = 1
and m = 13 are shown in Fig. 4, which were obtained by
solving the eigenvalue problem for the linearized Eqs. (1)
and (2). Here M1(m) denotes the eigenmode with the
poloidal mode number m that extends only to the inner-
most resonant surface rs1. Note that M1(1) has the same
mode structure as an STM. Similarly, M2(m) and M3(m)
denote the eigenmodes that extend to rs2 and rs3, respec-
tively. It is also noted that, for m = 13, M1 (not shown)
is stable, as can be expected from the linear stability of
STMs with higher m. Similar eigenmode structures are
found for DTMs, and indeed similar instability charac-
teristics are also expected for q proﬁles with more than
three q = 1 resonant surfaces.

After perturbing a large number of unstable modes
at random poloidal angles, the m = 1 mode evolves as
shown in Fig. 5. The most remarkable feature here is the
presence of a phase of nonlinearly driven growth. There,
the energy of the m = 1 perturbed mode grows exponen-
tially as exp(γdrivet). In this example, γdrive ≈ 0.16, i.e.,
the m = 1 mode grows at a rate one of magnitude larger
than its linear growth rate γlin(m = 1) = 16 × 10−3.
The nonlinear growth rate γdrive approximately equals
twice the maximum growth rate in the spectrum (Fig. 2),
γmax = 0.08, because it results from the nonlinear cou-
pling of m and m + 1 mode pairs.

The growth rates shown in Fig. 2 belong exclusively
to M3(m) modes, i.e., the modes extending to the out-
ermost resonant surface at r = rs3, since it was assumed
here that s1 < s3 (s1 = 0.35, s2 = −0.56, s3 = 1.20).
On the other hand, for a q proﬁle with s1 > s3, the
eigenmode M1(m = 1) has a higher growth rate than

FIG. 5: Evolution of the m = 1 TTM for the q proﬁle given in
Fig. 1. The perturbed kinetic and magnetic energies, denoted
by Ek and Em are plotted in (a). The growth rates γk and
γm given in (b) are estimated from Ek and Em, and γmax ≡
Max{γlin(m)} is the maximum growth rate in the spectrum in
Fig. 2 for SHp = 106. The system reaches the fully nonlinear
saturation in the phase denoted as “annular collapse,” i.e.,
t > 200.

M3(m = 1). However, also in this case, the highest
growth rate among all m modes, γmax, is typically several
times larger than γlin(m = 1) and therefore the nonlin-
early driven growth of the m = 1 mode still exceeds its
linear growth. It is concluded that the rapid nonlinear
growth of TTMs occurs in a wide range of TTM q pro-
ﬁles. Since the sawtooth crash is generally considered
to be triggered by the onset of an m = 1 mode [8], the
results presented here suggest that the nonlinear growth
of TTMs (or DTMs for a hollow current proﬁle) is one
of the possible mechanisms for experimentally observed
abrupt sawtooth crashes, i.e., the fast trigger.

Finally, the fully nonlinear regime given in Fig. 5 is
discussed. At about t = 200 electromagnetic turbu-
lence starts to develop in the whole inter-resonance region
rs1 < r < rs3, as can be seen in Fig. 6 (a). The ﬂuctua-
tions ﬂatten the q proﬁle through simultaneous magnetic
reconnection in the whole inter-resonance region. This
partial collapse (i.e., not involving the core) is essentially
completed around t = 220 ∼ 230. A contour plot showing
the situation after the q proﬁle was annularly ﬂattened is
given in Fig. 6 (b). An important property of an annular
collapse as the one shown in Fig. 6 is that no m = 1
islands needs to form and therefore the displacement of
the core plasma can be rather small.

This phenomenon is similar to the experimentally ob-
served oﬀ-axis temperature collapses without precursor
oscillations. For example, Edwards et al.
[10] reported
JET experiments where rapid sawtooth crashes without
evident precursor oscillations, but preceded by a partial
crash in an oﬀ-axis region, were observed.

A possible explanation for such phenomena was pro-
posed by Buratti et al. in terms of a “purely growing pre-

cursor” [11]. However, the results in Fig. (6) show that, if
a q proﬁle with relatively small inter-resonance distances
D12 and D23 is formed even temporarily, rapidly grow-
ing nonlinear TTMs can also cause such partial crashes
without precursors.

Precursor-free partial collapses during the ramp phase
of compound sawteeth oscillations were also observed in
tokamak discharges with hollow q proﬁles [12, 13, 14, 15],
where q = 1 DTMs can be expected. In analogy with the
TTM case discussed above, our results indicate that non-
linear growth of q = 1 DTMs can lead to such a partial
collapse. In cases where the growth rate spectrum peaks
at lower m (e.g., due to larger Dij or higher SHp), we
have also observed partial collapses (i.e., collapses in the
inter-resonance region) after which the core displacement
continues to grow, which is similar to experimental obser-
vations made in JET, given in Fig. 4 (A)-(C) in Ref. [10].

In summary, our numerical simulations have shown
that the simultaneous excitation of unstable q = 1 TTMs
with high m and their subsequent nonlinear interactions
lead to a rapid onset of the m = 1 triple tearing mode,
which qualitatively depicts the fast triggering of sawtooth
crashes observed in tokamak experiments. Similar behav-
ior has also been found in simulations of q = 1 DTMs. If
more than three q = 1 resonant surfaces are formed in a
tokamak discharge, we also expect similar multiple tear-
ing modes that grow rapidly with high poloidal mode
numbers. We have also presented a scenario, where a
nonlinear evolution of many unstable TTMs leads to a
partial collapse of a sawtooth without being preceded by
an m = 1 precursor. Similar phenomena were observed
during compound sawtooth oscillations in several exper-
iments [10, 12, 13, 14, 15].

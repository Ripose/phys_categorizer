Abstract

An analysis of experimental data from the RFX (Reversed Field eXperiment)

reversed ﬁeld pinch machine [L. Fellin, P. Kusstatscher and G. Rostagni, Fu-

sion Eng. Des. 25, 315 (1995)] is carried out to investigate the possible

existence of deterministic chaos in the edge plasma region. The mathematical

tools used include Lyapunov exponents, Kaplan–Yorke dimension, minimum

embedding dimension estimates and nonlinear forecasting. The whole analysis

agrees in ruling out the possibility of low–dimensional chaos: The dimension

of the underlying dynamical system is estimated to be > 10. From a critical

re–reading of the literature it emerges that the ﬁndings of this work are likely

to be common to all reversed ﬁeld pinches.

I. INTRODUCTION

Fusion machines are complex systems possessing a huge number of de-

grees of freedom where phenomena involve many scales of length and time.

Such devices are therefore natural candidates for checking of nonlinear theo-

ries. In the past years, as soon as the experimental instrumentation made it

possible, some eﬀort has been exerted to determine if the temporal behaviour

of measured quantities in fusion plasmas, displaying a ﬂuctuating behaviour,

could be modelled using some low–dimensional deterministic theory or were

the manifestation of truly random processes [1–8]. The results of this search

for deterministic chaos are contrasted: while the results of numerical simu-

lations [1] show the existence of low–dimensional chaos, experimental works

ﬁnd positive [2–5] as well as negative results [7,8].

In this paper we present a study on this subject done on experimental

data taken from the RFX experiment: a large (R = 2m, a = 0.457m) toroidal

device for the magnetic conﬁnement of plasmas in reversed ﬁeld pinch (RFP)

conﬁguration [9] built in Padova (Italy) and designed to reach a plasma cur-

rent of 2 MA. The data refer to measurements made in the outer region of the

plasma, inside the last closed magnetic surface. A number of mathematical

tools has been applied to these data to detect traces of deterministic chaos.

Furthermore, a critical discussion of the existing literature on the subject

is done, in the light of the results found, and some general conclusions are

drawn.

In the next section we illustrate the mathematical apparatus used, then a

brief description of the diagnostics used to collect the data is given. Section

IV presents the results of the analysis and ﬁnally some comments are given.

II. NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES

Several analysis techniques have been developed to identify the presence

of a low dimensional attractor in a dynamical system from its time series. In

this section we describe the mathematical tools used in this work. Some of

them are very recent and only recently have been applied to real experimental

data. Therefore there is a further interest in verifying how they perform in

this situation. All the techniques presented herein apply to a scalar time

series of recorded data S = (x1, x2, . . . , xN ). From the scalar series S one

may construct q–dimensional vectors in delay–coordinates,

The q–dimensional space of delay vectors plays a central role in this kind of

analysis. The integer τ is known as the time lag. It can be larger than 1, i.e.

data may be sampled at a frequency lower than the experimental one. This

is done since choosing τ smaller than the autocorrelation time tc of the data

would introduce spurious correlations. On the other hand τ should neither be

too large. The standard choice is to put τ ≈ 2 ÷ 3 tc. In our units, depending

upon the data, tc = 1 ÷ 2. To test the reliability of our results, τ was varied

in the test from 1 to 7 times tc. Conclusions were unaﬀected by the choice.

A. Estimate of the minimum embedding dimension

In experiments, the true dimension of the phase space of the system under

study (the embedding dimension m) is usually unknown. A reasonable guess

for it is however essential for any analysis. It has been proven by Takens [10]

that for a chaotic dynamical system the time recording of a single variable is

suﬃcient to reconstruct the relevant dynamics–and in particular the dimen-

sion d of the attractor–provided that m > 2d + 1 (in actual cases it is known

3

||Y − Z|| = max |Yi − Zi| , i = 1, . . . , m .

(4)

that this condition may be slightly relaxed).

In this work we have implemented the method proposed by Cao [11] to

estimate the minimum embedding dimension from a scalar time series.

This method uses the time–delay vectors (with τ set to one for simplicity)

yi(m) = [xi, xi+1, xi+2, . . . , xi+(m−1)] ,

i = 1, 2, . . . , N − (m − 1)

(where m is the guessed embedding dimension) to build the function

a(i, m) =

||yi(m + 1) − yn(i,m)(m + 1)||
||yi(m) − yn(i,m)(m)||

, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − m ,

where || · || is a norm and n(i, m) is an integer such that yn(i,m)(m) is the

nearest neighbour of yi(m) in the m–dimensional space, according to the || · ||

norm. The actual functional form of ||·|| does not appear to be of importance.

We have used the maximum norm:

If m is the true embedding dimension, any two points which are close together

in the m–dimensional reconstructed space, will stay close also in the m + 1

space. Points which satisfy this condition are called true neighbours, otherwise

false neighbours [12]. Starting from a low value for m and approaching the

correct value (hereafter referred to as ν) the number of false neighbours should

decrease to zero, or equivalently a(i, m) should reach a constant value. Cao

[11] suggests to use averages of this quantity:

and

E(m) =

a(i, m)

1
N − m

N −m

X
i=1

E1(m) = E(m + 1)/E(m)

,

which allow to obtain results independent upon the sample data chosen.

E1(m) should stop changing when m becomes greater than some value ν,

4

(2)

(3)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

if the time series has a ﬁnite dimensional attractor. In the case of random

data E1 will never saturate but when dealing with real data it is diﬃcult to

distinguish if it has attained a constant value or is slowly increasing, therefore

in Ref. [11] it is recommended to also compute the function

E2(m) = E∗(m + 1)/E∗(m)

,

E∗(m) =

1
N − m

N −m

X
i=1

|xi+m − xn(i,m)+m|

,

where the meaning of n(i, m) is the same as above. For random data E2 will

stay close to 1: the x’s are now independent random variables, and therefore

their average distance will be the same regardless of the space dimension

m. For deterministic data, there will be a certain correlation between them

which makes E2 a function of m. As an illustration of the method, we plot

E1, E2 in Figure 1 for two sets of data: one time series is computed using the

Mackey–Glass equation

dx(t)
dt

= −0.1x(t) +

0.2x(t − ∆)
1 + x(t − ∆)10

with ∆ = 30, which is known to describe the dynamics of a chaotic system

with an attractor dimension of about 3.6 [13]. The other time series is gen-

erated using a random number generator. In the random data series E2 is

always very close to one and E1 slowly converges to the same value. The plot

of the deterministic map shows instead that both E1 and E2 reach the same

value at D ≈ 6; furthermore the behavior of E1 is not that of an asymptotic

convergence to 1, but is more akin to the reaching of a threshold value.

B. Lyapunov exponents

The Lyapunov exponents, measuring the average divergence or conver-

gence of orbits in phase space, are among the most frequently used quantities

5

to ascertain the presence of chaos. Given a map x(t) = fx0(t), f : Rm → Rm,

the Lyapunov exponents are deﬁned as

λ(k) = lim
t→∞

1
t

ln |

∂fx0 (t)
∂x(k) | = lim

t→∞

1
t

||J (k)
t

|| , k = 1, . . . , m ,

(10)

where ||J (k)

t

|| is the kth eigenvalue of the m–dimensional Jacobian. A nec-

essary condition for a system to be chaotic is to have at least one positive

exponent.

Several well established techniques exist to compute the Lyapunov expo-

nents for a system whose dynamical evolution is analytically known. Extract-

ing them from an experimentally determined data set is much more diﬃcult

due to the limited length of the sample and to the presence of noise. Ex-

isting algorithms usually ﬁt the experimental points to an analytical map

g : Rm → R such that

(11)

(12)

g([xi, . . . , xi+m−1]) = xi+m

or, which is the same, to the map

˜g([xi, . . . , xi+m−1]) = [xi+1, . . . , xi+m]

,

˜g : Rm → Rm .

Under quite general conditions, the largest ν Lyapunov exponents of f and

˜g are the same [14,15]. Therefore one estimates the λ’s using standard tech-

niques on g, ˜g. In this work we have used two codes for estimating Lyapunov

exponents. The former is the code developed by Watts [6,7], based upon the

method by Briggs [14,16], and already used on data from a magnetically con-

ﬁned plasma. In this method the time series is embedded in a delay space of

given dimension, a number of nearest neighbours is found, and their trajec-

tory is ﬁt to an analytical function (usually a polynomial: in our runs we have

used a polynomial of order 2). Then the Jacobian (10) may be obtained by

analytical diﬀerentiation. The second code has been developed by one of us

6

[17] based upon a method by Gencay and Davis Dechert [15]. Here, a single

global ﬁt is done by using logistic maps, i.e.

g(Xi) =

vl =

L

X
l

L

X
l

βl
1 + exp(−bl − wl · Xi)

,

(13)

where L is the number of functions v and each w is an m–dimensional array.

The bl’s, βl’s and wl’s are ﬁtting parameters. Logistic maps have some inter-

esting features: they may ﬁt arbitrarily well any analytical function as well as

its derivative. In Ref. [15] it is stated that this choice of functions has some

advantages over the local polynomial approach in terms of stability of results

in presence of noise and of fewer needed data points. On the other hand it

requires a nonlinear ﬁtting which is computationally more demanding.

C. The correlation and Kaplan–Yorke dimensions

The correlation dimension Dc gives another estimate of the embedding

dimension of the system. Dc is deﬁned as

Cd(r) = lim
N→∞

1
N 2

N

X
i6=j=1

H(r − |Xi − Xj|)

,

(14)

where H is the Heaviside function and the X’s are deﬁned in Eq.(1). For

m > ν, limr→0 C(r) ≈ rν.

The correlation dimension has been and currently is a favourite tool to diag-

nose the presence of chaos in fusion plasmas [4,8].

Instead of Dc we have computed, using Watts’s code [7], the Kaplan–Yorke

(or Lyapunov) dimension

DKY = j + P

j
i=1 λi
−λj+1

(15)

where j is the largest integer such that P

j
i=1 λi > 0, with the λ’s ordered

as λ1 > λ2 > . . .. There exist some conjectures [18] according to which the

uguagliance DKY ≈ Dc holds

7

DKY is much easier to compute than Dc, since it is only necessary to know the

Lyapunov exponents, previously computed. This strength is at the same time

a weakness when there may exist uncertainties about the correct value of the

exponents. This is our case, however our analysis does not rely just on this

single parameter and as we shall see, all results corroborate the indications

from DKY .

D. Nonlinear forecasting

Given a time series of ﬁnite length representative of a chaotic dynamical

system governed by the map f : Rm → Rm, an inverse problem consists in

ﬁnding a smooth map ˜g : Rm → Rm, or its projection g : Rm → R such

that ˜g be an accurate approximation of f . In the case ˜g is obtained, it may

be used to predict accurately further data points. Otherwise, if the system

is not governed by a ﬁnite dimensional map, or if the guessed m is too low,

the forecasting will be unreliable after few predictions. A review about the

subject may be found in Ref. [13].

We have used as ﬁtting function the logistic maps (Eq. 13): the original

time series S of length N has been divided into two parts of lengths N1 and

N2 = N − N1. The ﬁrst N1 data have been used to ﬁt Eq. (13) and the

predictive power has been tested on the remaining N2 points. The measure

of goodness is the predictive error:

σ2 =

1
N2

N

X
n=N1+1

(xn − g(Xn−m))2
σ2
x

(16)

where σ2

x is the variance of the time series (in this work all data have been

normalized so to have σ2

x = 1). The increase of the trial embedding dimension–

provided that enough ﬁtting parameters are allowed–will give a slight decrease

of σ2 until m ≈ ν, when a sudden decrease to much smaller values is expected.

8

To provide the reader with an example, in Figure 2 we have plotted σ2 versus

m for the Mackey–Glass map where is clearly visible the decrease of more

than two orders of magnitude of σ when the dimension is > 4. For comparison

we have estimated the predictive power of the method against a time series

generated from a normal distribution. As expected the possibility of any

forecast is null, with σ2 always greater than the variance of the original data.

It is worth mentioning that estimating the Lyapunov exponents and corre-

lation dimensions has been attempted in all of this kind of studies concerning

fusion plasmas. The forecasting of the data, however, has been applied, to

our knowledge, only to data from the Madison Simmetric Torus (MST) [19]

reversed ﬁeld pinch device [7]. The estimate from the time series itself of the

embedding dimension, ﬁnally, is applied in this work for the ﬁrst time.

Some words must be spent about the conﬁdence which may be assigned to

the algorithms. Two crucial topics aﬀecting their performances are: the num-

ber of data available and their quality, i.e. how much they are polluted with

noise. As far as the ﬁrst point is concerned, usually the more data one can

elaborate the larger may be the dimension of the system which may be cor-

rectly estimated. We had available records of some thousands values, about

as many as used by MST group. The authors of all algorithms used here claim

them to be able to reconstruct the correct dynamics of a low–dimensional sys-

tem (ı.e. four or ﬁve–dimensional) using few hundreds data, with the possible

exception of the Watts’ code (see [6,7]). In conclusion, and by comparison

with the MST group’s estimates, we may assert that dimensions up to or just

below 10 may be correctly detected by our techniques.

III. RFX EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Signals coming from three diﬀerent diagnostic techniques have been anal-

ysed in search of low dimensional chaos features:

(a) Floating potential (Vf ): This is the potential of an electrically insu-

lated conducting probe immersed in the edge plasma. It is known to be related

to the local plasma potential Vp and to the local electron temperature Te (in

eV) through the relationship Vf = Vp − αTe where α is a constant which

for the RFX edge plasma is approximately equal to 2.5. The probe was a

graphite pin housed in a boron nitride structure which protected it from the

unidirectional superthermal electron ﬂow commonly observed in RFP edge

plasmas. Data were sampled at 1 MHz. The measurements were collected

during the experimental campaign described in [20].

(b) Time derivative of the radial magnetic ﬁeld (dBr/dt): It was measured

with a pick-up coil housed in the same boron nitride structure as the Vf

measuring pin. This is a local measurement, like the previous one. Data were

sampled at 1 MHz.

(c) Density ﬂuctuations at the edge: Collected by a reﬂectometer. The

RFX reﬂectometer has been especially designed to deal with high–frequency

ﬂuctuations. It is an homodyne reﬂectometer [21] operating at a maximum

sweep rate of 4 GHz/µs in the range 34-38 GHz. The collected signal is of

the form

s(t) = A(t) cos(∆φ(t))

(17)

with A amplitude and ∆φ phase diﬀerence of the reﬂected radiation at a ﬁxed

microwave frequency. In this work we have analyzed the temporal behaviour

of the amplitude.

Figure 3 displays the plasma current waveform and typical waveforms for

10

the three signals considered. The data were collected in discharges having a

plasma current ranging between 350 and 600 kA.

IV. RESULTS

Figure 4 displays the quantities E1, E2 (Eqns. 6, 7) for the three analyzed

signals. The data are taken for three diﬀerent shots (shot 8422 for magnetic

ﬂuctuations, shot 7999 for potential measures, and shot 7852 for reﬂectometer

data). A number of data points ranging up to about 10000 has been used. The

resemblance with random data (Fig. 1) is impressive, which clearly suggests

the existence of a very high dimensional phase space.

A further conﬁrmation is obtained by plotting the Kaplan–Yorke dimen-

sion (Fig. 5): no sign of saturation is obtained and over the whole explored

range DKY (m) ≈ m.

In Figure 6 we plot the predictive error (Eq. 16). The value of σ is always

close to one, meaning that no real accurate prediction may be done. Some

very small diﬀerences may be seen among the three signals, even if they may

well be just subjective impressions: the magnetic ﬂuctuations data show the

worst predictive power, suggesting perhaps that some diﬀerent mechanism

from the other two diagnostics is at work. This could be the case if mag-

netic ﬂuctuations are mostly due to magnetohydrodynamics tearing modes

whereas potential and density ﬂuctuations are mainly caused by some elec-

trostatic instabilities localized in the edge region. For the numerical aspect,

the calculation of this quantity turned out to be rather reliable, with limited

variations between runs.

Finally, in Figure 7 we plot the largest Lyapunov exponents. Since the

system does not appear to be dominated by low–dimensional chaos, the use-

fulness of these coeﬃcients is rather limited, however it may be interesting

11

to compare the two approaches. The estimation of the λ’s from real data is

known to be a diﬃcult task; we did not obtain stable results varying the pa-

rameters: indeterminacies of 50% are quite likely, so the values shown are to

be considered as representative of the general trend. We found that Watts’s

code is rather sensitive to the choice of the input parameters such as the order

of the polynomial and the number of neighbours to be used in the ﬁtting. Our

code is more stable from this point of view since it needs very few input data

(essentially, the embedding dimension m and the number of logistic map L).

However, it is diﬃcult to perform the ﬁt over a large number of data points

(600 is the maximum used), so the results suﬀer of the scarce statistics.

In Watts’s work it is emphasized that, in order for the previous analysis

to hold, the physical system must be in a stationary state. The breaking

down of this assumption may translate to an overestimate of the attractor

dimension or even make it non measurable. Watts quotes two possible causes

for the lack of non–stationarity: (a) The plasma may not reach a state of

equilibrium; (b) Even if equilibrium is reached, random perturbations (Watts

cites as an example the inﬂux of impurity ions from the walls) may destroy

it. In RFX discharges true ﬂat–top periods lasting some tens of milliseconds

are reached. In our study we have considered both discharges where this ﬂat–

top period was reached, and others where instead plasma parameters were

slowly changing. Conclusions are unaﬀected by the discharge chosen. We

are therefore conﬁdent that any lack of stationarity due to this causes may

just very slightly modify the results. Point (b) is by nature uncontrollable:

however, since the same results are obtained from diﬀerent discharges it may

be hoped that these random events have not aﬀected the ﬁnal results.

All our results agree in clearly pointing out that no low–dimensional chaos

appears at the RFX edge. This is well consistent with ﬁndings of Watts et

al. [6,7] for MST. When limiting to RFP’s the only other research within this

12

ﬁeld is that done in HBTX1A [22] by Gee and Taylor [2], where traces of

low–dimensional chaos were found in magnetic–ﬁeld oscillations. This sharp

discrepancy puzzled us, therefore we resorted to check conclusions of Gee and

Taylor against their own data. In Ref. [2] the attractor dimension is estimated

using the correlation dimension technique (Eq. 14); their ﬁgure 1 shows the

behaviour of log C(r) versus log r. Gee and Taylor claim that the slope of these

lines saturate in correspondence of a dimension ≈ 7. We could not check this

since in their ﬁgure 1 only dimensions from 1 to 6 are plotted. However, from

the data available, we could not ﬁnd any clue of such a saturation: the slope

of the straight line for m = 6, as estimated by visual inspection of the plot,

appears close to 8. Even allowing for the large error induced by our gross

way of estimating, the true result cannot be much smaller than 6, which is a

necessary condition to speak about a saturation of the slope [23].

Up to this point, our work has focussed almost entirely on RFP plasmas.

Some interesting considerations may be drawn by comparison with those toka-

mak plasmas where the ﬁngerprints of deterministic chaos have been found.

We refer to the works [3,4]. From Ref. [3], using data of TOSCA [24] and the

Joint European Torus (JET) [25] tokamaks, it appears that a small value of

the dimension of the dynamical system is more likely to be found if the level

of turbulence (measured for example by δB/B) is small, which is not what

happens in RFP’s. Barkley’s data [4] are a bit diﬃcult to interpret since their

analysis are done on ﬁltered data, i.e. by selecting the wave number com-

ponents k. Their ﬁnding is that the dimension increases with k. However,

Barkley’s data are chord averaged, so the central plasma plays a dominant

role. In our work, and in the others studied, only edge quantities have been

considered. It is quite possible that diﬀerent mechanisms be at work in the

two zones.

13

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work four statistical tools have been applied to the signals of some

plasma turbulence measurements (magnetic ﬁeld–, electrostatic potential–,

and density ﬂuctuations) of the RFX experiment, addressing the question of

the existence of low dimensional deterministic chaos in them. The methods

of analysis are well established (correlation dimension) as well as more recent

(predicting errors and minimum embedding dimension estimates).

All the conclusions are strikingly in accordance in ruling out that the dy-

namics of the edge plasma in RFP’s may be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by any

low–dimensional process [26]. An estimate of a lower bound for the dimen-

sion of the system may be given by Figure 6, which shows that this value

must be greater than 10. This conclusion is further strenghtened by a critical

re–examination of previous results [2] conﬂicting with ours, which has shed

some doubt about their validity.

the signals may be composed by a contribution coming from these processes together with

16

another due to turbulence. What we can say is that the latter is overwhelming.

FIG. 3. Examples of the signals used. Smooth curves are the plasma current (Ip), the wildly

ﬂuctuating ones are the signals. Note that we are referring to three diﬀerent discharges.

FIG. 4. E1, E2 (see section II A) for the three signals. Here and in all the following plots V

stands for potential ﬂuctuations; B, magnetic ﬁeld; ne, density ﬂuctuations. Diamonds, E1; Stars,

E2.

FIG. 5. Kaplan–Yorke dimension for the three signals.

FIG. 6. The largest Lyapunov exponent versus embedding dimension. Stars are results from

Watts’ code, diamonds from our code.

FIG. 7. Predictive error versus embedding dimension.

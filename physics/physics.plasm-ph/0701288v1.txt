The longitudinal dynamics of a resonantly driven Langmuir wave are analyzed in the limit that the
growth of the electrostatic wave is slow compared to the bounce frequency. Using simple physical ar-
guments, the nonlinear distribution function is shown to be nearly gaussian in the canonical particle
action, with a slowly evolving mean and ﬁxed variance. Self-consistency with the electrostatic po-
tential provide the basic properties of the nonlinear distribution function including a frequency shift
that agrees well with driven, electrostatic particle simulations. This extends earlier work on nonlin-
ear Langmuir waves by Morales and O’Neil [G.J. Morales and T.M. O’Neil, Phys. Rev. Lett. 28, 417
(1972)], and could form the basis of a reduced kinetic treatment of Raman backscatter in a plasma.

INTRODUCTION

Much of the progress in understanding Langmuir waves
has been from the linear viewpoint, obtained by as-
suming that the perturbation of the plasma from its
(Maxwellian) equilibrium is “suﬃciently small” such that
second order terms in the perturbation may be neglected.
Under these conditions, one can derive the normal modes
of the distribution function (the singular Case-Van Kam-
pen modes [1, 2]) or, alternatively, the Landau damped
“modes” of the electric ﬁeld [3, 4]. A basic result of these
linear analyses is that smooth, electrostatic perturbations
tend to zero through the process of Landau damping.

That such damping is not universal was ﬁrst pointed
out by Bernstein, Green, and Kruskal (BGK) [5], who in-
cluded the particles trapped in the electrostatic wave to
formulate nonlinear distribution functions that give rise
to time-independent electrostatic disturbances. Explicit
constructions of sinusoidal, small-amplitude BGK waves
were later derived by Holloway and Dorning [6], in which
they showed that even arbitrarily small amplitude waves
can exist without being Landau damped. BGK distribu-
tions are generally functions of the conserved particle en-
ergy H = 1
eΦ(z) whose charge perturbation self-
consistently generates the electrostatic potential Φ(z) via
Poisson’s equation. Thus, BGK distributions are static
solutions to the 1D Vlasov-Poisson system

where f is the electron distribution function and we con-

In this paper, we introduce and characterize nonlin-
ear Langmuir wave solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson sys-
tem (1) that are naturally occurring BGK-like waves.

∗Electronic address: rlindberg@berkeley.edu

These waves (and the distribution functions that gen-
erate them) have particular relevance to laser-plasma
physics, in that they dynamically arise as kinetic, non-
linear Langmuir waves in systems that are weakly driven
on or near resonance. To obtain these solutions, we use
the canonical action-angle coordinates, ﬁnding that the
plasma is well-described by a simpliﬁed distribution func-
tion that is gaussian in the canonical action. In this way,
we obtain near-equilibrium solutions that approximate
the fully time-dependent distribution function when the
resonant forcing is small. While these notions may be
reminiscent of adiabatic theory, we do not invoke adi-
abatic invariance, since we imagine that the plasma is
resonantly driven. Our calculation is more in the spirit
of an averaged theory, in that the dynamical dependence
on the canonical angle is ignored on the grounds of rapid
phase-mixing in the Langmuir wave, while the particle
action evolves self-consistently.

Because these nonlinear, kinetic Langmuir waves arise
naturally in slowly driven systems, their bulk properties
can be used to illuminate basic plasma processes and ob-
tain reduced descriptions of complex phenomena. For
example, the nonlinear frequency shift of the thermal
Langmuir resonance is an important quantity in any re-
duced model of Raman scattering in plasma [7, 8, 9, 10],
and our results extend those of Morales and O’Neil [11]
to colder plasmas and larger electrostatic potentials Φ(z).
We leave such an implementation in a Langmuir envelope
code to future work.

In Sec. II we ﬁrst present the single particle equations
of motion and then show that for a weakly driven sys-
tem, the particles move in an essentially sinusoidal po-
tential. We proceed by reviewing the relevant pendulum
dynamics and action-angle coordinates. In Sec. III we in-
troduce the plasma distribution function, and use a few
simple, physically motivated assumptions to show that
a slowly excited plasma is well-represented by a distri-
bution function that is gaussian in the canonical action
with a ﬁxed variance. Next, in Sec. IV, we use Coulomb’s
law and the demands of self-consistency to derive the
functional relationship between the mean action and the

amplitude of the potential. This fully speciﬁes the distri-
bution function, from which we then extract the natural
frequency of the BGK-type wave. We compare the mean
action and frequency of these nonlinear Langmuir waves
to those obtained from self-consistent particle simulations
in Sec. V for thermal plasmas with 0.4

II. SINGLE PARTICLE EQUATIONS OF
MOTION: THE DRIVEN PENDULUM

In this section we present the single particle equations
and derive the canonical action-angle variables relevant
to a weakly-driven plasma wave. These familiar results
are subsequently used in Sec. III to motivate our simpli-
ﬁed, ﬂuid-like characterization of the electron distribu-
tion function for a slowly growing Langmuir wave.

In what follows we ignore transverse variation, as-
suming that the dominant dynamics are along the lon-
gitudinal axis z. We ignore the motion of the back-
ground ions, and furthermore assume that the longitu-
dinal force on the electrons can be divided into two com-
ponents: the ﬁrst is given by an external driving po-
tential V (z, t) sin(ωt + kz), which could be, for example,
a ponderomotive force; the second arises from the self-
consistent electrostatic potential Φ(z, t) of the plasma
electrons. Thus, Newton’s equation of motion for the
longitudinal electron coordinate z(t) is given by

FIG. 1: Phase space schematic for a monochromatic wave
overlaid on the results of a self-consistent particle simulation.
Region I (above the separatrices) consists of the plasma bulk
making up the wave; region II contains the trapped particles
between the separatrices; region III contains those particles
moving too fast to be trapped in the wave.

Furthermore, since Φ(z, t) is excited by the slowly vary-
ing potential V (z, t), the Eikonal conditions (3) imply
that the amplitudes φn(z, t) and phase shifts ξn(z, t) are
similarly slowly varying. We assume that the plasma is
not highly nonlinear, so that the potential is adequately
described by its ﬁrst (n = 1) harmonic. We have found
that this assumption is not overly restrictive: for φ1 as

large as one-half simulations indicate that φ2 ∼

Finally, we assume that the space-charge force from the
plasma bulk is dominant, i.e.,

Here, we include a few important results regarding the
pendulum Hamiltonian (8). The frozen orbits are de-
(p, θ; τ ) = H at a ﬁxed time
ﬁned as the level sets
τ , for which the parameters φ1 and δω are constant and
the motion is periodic. A representative phase portrait of
the frozen orbits is in Fig. 1, superposed on a phase-space

Generically, we see that phase space is divided into three
distinct regions, separated by the trajectories joining the
hyperbolic ﬁxed points at θ =
δω, for which
H = 2φ1. These separatrices separate the rotation mo-
tion of regions I and III, for which H > 2φ1, from the
libration about the stable ﬁxed point at θ = 0 in region
II, where H < 2φ1. Associated with these frozen orbits,
there exists a canonical transformation to action-angle
coordinates
(J, Ψ; τ ), with the action pro-
portional to the phase-space area of the frozen orbit:

As is well-known, the integral in (9) can be evaluated in
terms of complete elliptic integrals. Furthermore, since
the orbits change their topology at the separatrix, the
action coordinate is discontinuous there. While no ac-
tual particle orbits are singular, this discontinuity does
complicate notation; for this reason, we ﬁnd it convenient
to introduce the “frequency-shifted action”
(κ) that is
aﬃnely related to J, and deﬁned according to the phase
space region in which the trajectory lives. Taking the

Although the transformation (p, θ)

III. THE NONLINEAR DISTRIBUTION
FUNCTION ACTION ANSATZ

In this section, we introduce our BGK-type distri-
bution function ansatz that naturally arises in weakly
driven plasmas. This results in a dramatic reduction in
the number of degrees of freedom from the Vlasov equa-
tion (1a), and therefore can be used as the foundation of
a simpliﬁed, ﬂuid-like model.

We ﬁrst motivate our assumed functional form for f ,
showing how simple physical arguments based on parti-
cle phase mixing in the slowly changing electrostatic ﬁeld

governed by Vlasov evolution lead to a very simple dis-
tribution: gaussian in the canonical action J with slowly
evolving mean and ﬁxed variance. We include an exam-
ple from a slowly driven, self-consistent particle simula-
tion that naturally evolves in this way, and compare it
to the more familiar velocity-space distributions. Finally,
we give the distribution function in an explicit form from
which phase-space averages can be computed.

A. Phase-mixing in the slowly-growing wave

The central assumption for our distribution function
action ansatz is that the Langmuir wave amplitude and
frequency are slowly evolving, meaning that the parame-
ters φ1(τ ) and δω(τ ) of the pendulum Hamiltonian (8) do
not vary appreciably over the period
. For the nearly all
electrons, i.e., all except the exponentially few in a nar-
row range about the separatrix, the condition of “slow-
ness” can be written as

As previously noted, while these conditions are rem-
iniscent of adiabatic motion, we do not explicitly in-
voke adiabaticity; rather, we use the slowness condition
(17) to justify our assumption that the distribution func-
tion remains essentially uniform in the canonical angle
Ψ throughout its evolution. Far from the separatrices, it
is clear that the slowness conditions (17) imply that the
electrons make many oscillations before the parameters
of the wave signiﬁcantly change, so that a set of these
particles that is initially uniform in canonical angle re-
mains so under evolution by (8). As particles approach
the separatrix where κ
1 and the nonlinear period
diverges
, such a simple argument breaks
ln
down. In this case, we invoke the results of phase evolu-
tion by Cary and Skodje [12, 13] and Elskens and Escande
[14], obtained by analyzing the near-separatrix motion in
slowly evolving systems.

For most of the particles, the canonical angle is
mapped smoothly through the separatrix. In a naive pic-
ture, the strip of particles in region I with the same action
Ψ < 2π is mapped across the sep-
J and spread over 0
aratrix to the strip from 0
Ψ < π that then rotates
≤
in region II. As shown in [12, 13, 14], this picture is es-
sentially correct to O(ǫ), excluding the exponentially few
O
particles that pass very close to the hyper-
bolic ﬁxed point. Since these particles can spend an ar-
bitrarily long time tracing the stable manifold, they lead
to long, diﬀuse phase-space tendrils. Neglecting these
particles, to each action is associated a strip of parti-
cles that is mapped to one-half the canonical angle upon
crossing the separatrix. This proceeds with each succes-
sive action strip, with each one displaced from the next
by a relative phase in the canonical angle. The relative
phase between increasing action strips increases up to
2π, for which the action has increased by O(ǫ) (see [14]

(cid:1)

4

for a detailed discussion).
In this way, we argue that
the distribution remains phase mixed to O(ǫ) even when
crossing the separatrix, provided only that the slowness
conditions (17) are met.

Assuming that the electrostatic wave amplitude and
phase velocity are slowly varying, the previous arguments
indicate that the distribution function remains uniform
in the canonical angle throughout the range 0
Ψ < 2π,
resulting in the following simpliﬁcation:

≤

(18)

f (J, Ψ; τ )

1
2π f (J; τ ).

∝

→
To make further progress, we also assume that the dis-
tribution f (J; τ ) is well-represented by its ﬁrst two mo-
ments in canonical action. This is trivially true if φ1 = 0,
J and a Maxwellian plasma is gaussian in
for which v
action. In the general case, this assumption is similar in
spirit to a warm-ﬂuid theory (see, e.g., [15, 16]), for which
asymptotic solutions are obtained by systematically ne-
glecting the (presumably small) third- and higher-order
moments in v. By using moments in J, however, our
model will self-consistently include the eﬀects of trapped
particles on the Langmuir wave, as do the models of Hol-
loway, Dorning and Buchanan [6, 17]; on the other hand,
unlike the theories of [15, 16], ours is non-relativistic.
Retaining only the ﬁrst two moments in the canonical
action is equivalent to prescribing f to be gaussian in J:

f (J; τ ) =

We can simplify (19) in the following manner. The
Vlasov equation (1a) permits an inﬁnite number of con-
servation laws (Casimirs), of which the entropy is one of
particular physical signiﬁcance:

d
dτ Z

dJdΨ f (J, Ψ; τ ) ln f (J, Ψ; τ ) = 0.

(20)

Using the gaussian-in-action distribution (19), the con-
servation of entropy (20) implies that

d
dτ

ln σ(τ ) = 0,

(21)

i.e., that the gaussian width is ﬁxed throughout the evo-
lution. Some care must be taken to apply this result
across the separatrix where the action J is not contin-
uous; note that this is an issue of coordinates, not dy-
namics. Since the coordinate J doubles across the sepa-
ratrix, the width in J similarly doubles. To be more pre-
cise, the phase space region
just
above (or below) the separatrix corresponds to the equal
area region between the separatrices over the intervals
. Thus, in terms of the scaled
[2J1, 2(J1 + δJ)], [0, π)

actions
(κ) deﬁned in (11), the width σ is the same in
all regions. Using the results (19) and (21), we arrive at
the following form for the distribution function

B. Phase space averages

Here, we combine the distribution function (22) with
our assumptions on the slowly-varying nature of ¯

rive at a convenient expression of phase space averages
in terms of the variables κ and τ . First, we note that for
ﬁxed parameters φ1, δω, there exists a canonical trans-
formation of
(H, τ ) for which the evolution
parameter is the coordinate θ. Since the transformation
is canonical, the Jacobian is unity and we have the fol-
lowing relation between the integration measures:

Assuming that the average action does not change signiﬁ-

through the integral over τ . Hence, in subsequent calcu-
lations we suppress the dependence of f on τ . To further
simplify notation and integration limits, we assign the
following expressions for the distribution in κ appropri-

FIG. 2: Wavelength averaged distribution functions for three
values of the electrostatic potential φ1 using k2λD = 0.3.
In velocity-space, (a) shows the ﬂattening of f (v) about the
phase velocity kv/ωp ≈ 1.16. Meanwhile, (b) demonstrates
that the distribution in canonical action remains nearly gaus-
sian throughout the excitation of the plasma wave.

Note that as deﬁned the initial width is a measure of the
temperature such that σ = kλD.

To illustrate the distributions associated with (22), we
have performed a number of single-wavelength particle
simulations, described in greater detail in Sec. V, that
solve the periodic Vlasov-Poisson system. We include
representative results in Fig. 2, obtained with a drive po-
tential V = 0.01 and initial σ = 0.3. In Fig. 2(a) we see
the characteristic ﬂattening of f (v) near the phase veloc-
ity that is associated with particle trapping. For the same
values of φ1, Fig. 2(b) demonstrates that the distribution
in J (integrated over Ψ) remains nearly gaussian in the
canonical action. Furthermore, except for the slight os-
cillations near the resonance region, f (J) has a constant
variance σ2 and a slightly increasing mean (from ωL).
Note that Fig. 2 uses the numerically calculated J from
the exact simulation potential, which we ﬁnd only diﬀers
from the pendulum results very near the separatrix.

IV. NONLINEAR SELF-CONSISTENCY:
PARAMETERIZING THE DISTRIBUTION

the nonlinear dielectric is given by

Now that we have presented the distribution function
ansatz and developed the necessary pendulum machin-
ery, we turn to calculating expressions for the mean ac-
tion ¯
and the frequency shift δω. We do this by impos-
I
ing the constraints of self-consistency: the assumed dis-
tribution function must also satisfy Maxwell’s equations.
After obtaining ¯
and δω in terms of integrals over the
I
modulus of the elliptic functions, we will derive small-
amplitude, analytic expressions suitable to comparisons
with previous published results. In the next section we
compare these theoretical results to numerical examples
from a self-consistent particle code.

A. Self-consistency and Maxwell’s equations

First, our nonlinear distribution function must give rise
to a charge separation commensurate with the electro-
static potential φ(z, t). This is summarized by the Pois-
son equation:

Equation (31) determines the mean frequency-shifted ac-

previous works (e.g., [8, 11]), expressions similar to (31)
were interpreted as the frequency shift of the wave. We
will see that in the small φ1 limit, the change in ¯
equals
I
the change in the frequency. This is because the parti-
cle action J is essentially constant in this case, so that
is due to a decrease
I ∝
in the phase velocity of the wave at ﬁxed k [i.e., given
by δω(τ )]. As the wave amplitude becomes appreciable,
however, the plasma bulk becomes excited and the in-
crease in canonical action J can no longer be neglected,
so that δω(τ ) < ¯
ωL and (31) is numerically larger

than the (generically negative) frequency shift.

To complete the characterization of the action distri-

To determine δω, we use the fact that the plasma tends
to set up a return current to erase any long-range elec-
tric ﬁelds. This is related to the fact that in 1-D with
immobile ions, the electrons gain no net momentum. To
make this more explicit, we consider the 1-D Coulomb

For clarity, we reserve the cumbersome calculations used
to evaluate (36) for the Appendix. In the Appendix, we
show that our assumed distribution gives a concrete pre-
scription for the usual pole occurring when the particle
velocity matches that of the wave phase velocity. Denot-
ing the principal value by P, from (A.3) we have

Setting the linear dielectric (37) to zero yields the plasma
dispersion relation as found by Vlasov [20], resulting in a
purely real natural frequency. Physically, this lack of lin-
ear Landau damping arises because we have assumed that
the distribution is completely phase mixed. As shown
by O’Neil [21], such phase mixing causes linear Landau
damping to be a transient eﬀect that itself damps away
1/(ωp√φ1). Although the
on the bounce time scale
0, we maintain that our
bounce time diverges as φ1 →
analysis and the dispersion relation (37) applies to ﬁ-
nite amplitude waves after several bounce periods have
passed. In this case, the distribution is nearly uniform in
canonical angle and Landau damping has been “washed
out”. The nonlinear fate of such Langmuir waves is gen-
erally considered to be a BGK wave; as discussed in [6]
and [17], the dispersion relation of small amplitude, si-
nusoidal BGK waves is that of Vlasov, and is identical to
(37) derived here.

A similar expression for the small amplitude dielectric
has been derived by a number of authors, although there
is some variation in the O(1) coeﬃcient replacing our
1.089.
Interestingly, our coeﬃcient is precisely that of
Dewar [22], who calculated the frequency shift assuming
a small but ﬁnite sinusoidal wave that is adiabatically
excited; other calculations in a similar regime have ob-
tained values of 1.41 (Manheimer and Flynn [23]), 1.76
(Rose and Russell [8]) and 1.60 (Barnes [24]). It should
be noted that these diﬀer slightly from the coeﬃcient of
1.63 calculated by Morales and O’Neil [11] and separately
by Dewar [22] for an instantaneously excited wave (i.e.,
the initial value problem). The majority of these authors
then use this to determine the nonlinear frequency shift
using an expression similar to (31); we will see that this
yields reasonable results provided that φ1 . σ2.

To complete the small amplitude analysis of the change
in the average action (31), we diﬀerentiate the linear dis-
persion relation (37), obtaining ∂
ε(ωL, φ1) in the small

amplitude limit. Using (31) and (38), we ﬁnd that the
change in the mean action is expressed for small values

of δω from the action distribution (solid line) agrees quite well with the simulation results, which are only closely represented
by the Dewar/O’Neil theory (39) for small values of φ1. To calculate our theoretical frequency shift, we evaluate the numerical
integral (35) with the mean ¯I evaluated numerically using the approximate expression (31).

V. COMPARISON TO SELF-CONSISTENT
PARTICLE SIMULATIONS

In this section, we compare our theoretical results for
the properties of the slowly-driven nonlinear Langmuir
waves with those obtained from particle simulations. Be-
fore discussing these examples, we make a few comments
on the numerical methods.
In these single-wavelength
simulations, we numerically solve the equations of motion
for the electrons and the electric ﬁeld, driven by an exter-
nal force. For a wavelength with N electrons, the electron
k2zj experiences the combined self-
with coordinate ζj ≡
consistent electrostatic force and prescribed drive, giving
rise to the following equation of motion:

a given drive potential V (τ ) using a symplectic operator-
splitting scheme that is second-order accurate.

To compare the simulation results to our theory, we
slowly turn on the ponderomotive drive, ramping the
electrostatic ﬁeld to a chosen amplitude, at which time we
slowly turn the drive oﬀ. By taking the Hilbert transform
of the potential we obtain the total frequency (ωL + δω),
from which we extract the frequency shift for a given am-
plitude φ1. These results are shown in Fig. 3, where we
compare the frequency shift extracted from simulation
to the well-known result of Morales and O’Neil [11] and
√φ1f ′′(¯
Dewar [22], δω
), and to our theory for three

For the Dewar/O’Neil theory, we use equation (39) which
is of the form ﬁrst derived by Morales and O’Neil [11],
but with the O(1) pre-factor of Dewar [22]. We evaluate
the action ansatz value of δω by numerically integrating
(35), with the average action ¯
given by the relations
I
(29) and (31).

∼

As we can see in Fig. 3, the Dewar/O’Neil theory
agrees with our results for small values of φ1, but de-
viate at larger values of the potential. Furthermore,
our nonlinear theory captures both the qualitative and
quantitative features of δω seen in the particle simula-
tions over the entire range φ1. The discrepancy between
theories becomes particularly clear for colder plasmas;
for kλD = 0.2, (c) shows that the Dewar/O’Neil the-
ory is only applicable when there is negligible frequency
shift, while the action ansatz yields reasonable qualita-
tive agreement for all amplitudes. We do note, however,
that the quantitative agreement is worse than that ob-
served for warmer plasmas; we speculate that this is due
to the signiﬁcant harmonic content of these highly non-
linear Langmuir waves.

The range of φ1 over which δω was measured in Fig. 3
includes all electrostatic amplitudes that were attained
via resonant excitation with the drive amplitude V =
0.01 and frequency equal to ωL. Further driving of the
plasma results in a ringing of φ1 that we interpret as
resulting from the de-tuning of the nonlinear Langmuir
wave from the external drive.

VI. CONCLUSION

9

We have presented a nonlinear electron distribution
function that naturally arises for slowly driven Lang-
muir waves, and is parameterized by the amplitude of the
electrostatic potential. The distribution function is de-
scribed by a gaussian in the canonical action whose mean
varies self-consistently according to the slowly evolving
potential, and whose variance remains ﬁxed at the initial
plasma temperature. We then determined the nonlinear
frequency shift of the Langmuir wave (35), which agrees
well with full particle simulations. This frequency shift
could be used in a reduced, ﬂuid-like model for driven
plasmas, while the asymptotic distribution function (22)
hints at a simpliﬁed model of nonlinear Landau damping
via the dynamical process of phase-mixing. Present re-
search aims to use these results as the kinetic foundation
of an extended three-wave model of Raman backscatter
in a thermal plasma.

FIG. 4: Change in the canonical action ¯J for three diﬀerent
temperatures: kλD = 0.4, kλD = 0.3, and kλD = 0.2. The
points are obtained from the simulation while the curves are
numerical evaluations of ¯J using ¯J ≡ ¯I − δω. As in Fig. 3, the
range of φ1 includes all amplitudes attained with a V = 0.01
resonant drive; we interpret the saturation of φ1 to be caused
by de-tuning from the drive.

Finally, we conclude this section with simulation re-
sults regarding the measured change in the mean canon-
ical action ¯J. To measure this, we use the extracted
frequency shift δω to determine the energy of each par-
ticle using the total potential (including harmonics):
Hj = 1
φ(ζj). Solving this for the momentum,
we numerically integrate the exact frequency-shifted ac-
tion for each particle, and obtain the average ¯J via

In the usual adiabatic approximations, the particle action
is conserved so that (42) is constant. However, our theory
predicts ¯J to increase as the potential grows. We inter-
pret this as resulting from the manner in which we excite
the plasma: since the plasma is resonantly driven, the
time-scale separation between the drive and the plasma
response can be vanishingly small even for slowly chang-
ing amplitudes. Thus, the particle action need not be an
adiabatic invariant.

To further validate this claim, we present the simula-
tion results for the change in the average canonical action
¯J in Fig. 4, and compare this to our theory for the tem-
peratures of Fig. 3. We see remarkable agreement for
temperatures such that k2λD = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2. First, this
indicates that the canonical action of the particles is not
conserved in these slowly-driven problems. Rather, we
ﬁnd a well-described relation between the electrostatic
potential and the change in the average action. In the
small amplitude limit, the change in ¯J scales as φ3/2
as
shown in the Appendix (A.8), while numerical evidence
indicates that it scales roughly as φ2

Adding these contributions, we ﬁnd that the small am-
plitude behavior of the nonlinear dielectric is

Finally, we calculate the diﬀerence between the fre-
quency shifted average action and the frequency, namely,
the average action ¯J. Using the deﬁnition ¯

the expression for the frequency shift (35), we ﬁnd that

By appropriate choice of signs for κ, we can express (A.5)

It can be shown that both integrals vanish in the limit

Thus, we see that the average action ¯J grows as φ3/2
for
φ1 small. For Langmuir wave amplitudes such that these
terms can be neglected, the frequency shift is equal to the
change in the frequency shifted action, and the canonical
action is approximately conserved.

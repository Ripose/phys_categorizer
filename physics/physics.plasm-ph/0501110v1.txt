The saturation mechanism of the Weibel instability is investigated theoretically by considering the
evolution of the currents, which are carried by numerous cylindrical beams, or ‘ﬁlaments’, generated
at the early stage of the instability. The saturation process is described by a physical model of the
beams. It is found that the magnetic ﬁeld strength reaches the maximum value when the currents in
the beams evolve to the Alfv´en current, and there are two regimes of the saturation. The analytical
results of the model are in good agreement with the results from kinetic particle-in-cell simulations,
for both electron-positron and electron-proton plasmas.

The Weibel instability [1, 2] is driven in anisotropic
collisionless plasmas and generates magnetic ﬁelds. Re-
cently, this instability has attracted great interest in
astrophysical plasmas as well as laboratory plasmas.
For example, it is considered that this instability can
be driven in strong collisionless shock waves associated
with various astrophysical phenomena; e.g., pulsar winds
[3, 4], gamma-ray bursts and/or their afterglows [5], or
gravitational collapse of the large-scale structure of the
universe [6]. The magnetic ﬁeld generated by the insta-
bility will be responsible for synchrotron and/or ‘jitter’
radiation from high-energy particles existing there [7].
Furthermore, such magnetic ﬁelds can provide an eﬀec-
tive scattering mechanism for charged particles; it would
aﬀect, for example, the dissipation process of collisionless
shock waves, the eﬃciency of the Fermi acceleration, or
heat conductivity by charged particles. This instability
can also be driven if temperature gradients are present in
plasmas [8]. For all cases, the amplitude of the magnetic
ﬁeld is of primary importance.

The magnetic ﬁeld strength reaches the maximum
value when the instability saturates. Several conditions
for the saturation have been proposed [5, 9]. However,
these conditions would not yet be satisfactory; in partic-
ular, the role of the currents in the saturation process is
not clear. Because the currents are responsible for the
magnetic ﬁeld in this instability, they must play an es-
sential role in the process. As is shown by two- or three-
dimensional simulations (e.g., [10, 11]), the currents are
carried by numerous particle beams. Therefore, the sat-
uration mechanism should be strongly related with the
evolution of the beams.

In this letter, the saturation mechanism of the Weibel
instability is investigated by considering the evolution of
the beams. The method is based on a physical model of
the beams, which is applicable to electron-proton plas-
mas as well as electron-positron plasmas. However, for
electron-proton plasmas, only the saturation due to the
electron currents is considered and the protons are as-
sumed not to contribute to the currents; the second sat-

Theoretical model of saturation — In this section,
the saturation mechanism of the Weibel instability is
modeled. Here, Gaussian units and the following no-
tations are used: the speed of light c; the velocity of
a particle normalized by the speed of light, β, and the
β2)−1/2; the elec-
Lorentz factor of the particle γ

The initial condition is given as follows. The plasma is
initially uniform, unmagnetized, and anisotropic. (The
condition to ignore background magnetic ﬁelds is dis-
cussed later.) The initial velocity distributions of par-
ticles are axisymmetric and the velocity dispersion along
the z-axis is larger than those of the other axes. For
electron-positron plasmas, the distribution functions are
the same for both species. For electron-proton plasmas,
only that of the electrons is relevant, as mentioned above.
Such a distribution function would be plausible for two-
stream like conditions [2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12]. The opposite
anisotropy cases [1, 3, 9, 13] are deferred to future work.
A basic physical picture of the instability is given as fol-
lows. At the initial stage of the instability, charged par-
ticles in the plasma are deﬂected by small magnetic ﬂuc-
tuations existing there. In the present condition, most
particles have larger velocity along the z-axis. Since par-
ticles carrying the current toward the +z direction and
those toward the
z direction are deﬂected oppositely,
they are separated into diﬀerent regions [5]. As a result,
in two- or three-dimension, a lot of (approximately) cylin-
drical beams, or ‘ﬁlaments’, are formed in the plasma
[11]. Each beam carries a net current in either +z or
z
direction and generates a magnetic ﬁeld around itself.
The more the magnetic ﬁelds are ampliﬁed, the more the
two populations of particles are separated and the cur-
rents are ampliﬁed, and vice versa. Thus, this process
acts as an instability; both currents and magnetic ﬁelds
grow exponentially until the saturation occurs.

Based on this picture, we start the following analy-
sis from the ‘initial condition’ where the plasma consists

are almost uniform in size and in magnitude of the cur-
rent because the initial radii of them are related to the
wavelength of the most unstable mode in the linear the-
ory, which is constant in a uniform plasma. Since two
beams with currents in the same direction attract each
other and tend to coalesce into a larger beam, the beams
grow with time [10]. Nevertheless, they are still regarded
as uniform at any point of time because they essentially
evolve equally. Thus, the evolution of the instability can
be understood through examining the evolution of one
of the beams. Assuming a uniform current density J, a
cylindrical beam can be characterized by two quantities:
its radius r and current I, where I = πr2J. According to
the Amp`ere’s law, the root-mean-square of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength within the beam is calculated as

B =

√2πr

I.

(1)

Although this is an idealization and the magnetic ﬁeld
it
can be aﬀected by neighboring beams in reality,
will give the correct order of the typical magnetic ﬁeld
strength and we use it in the following consideration.

Based on this model, let us consider the evolution of
a typical beam.
In the early stage of the instability,
both current and magnetic ﬁeld in the beam grow ex-
ponentially, as already mentioned. The radius of the
beam also increases through the coalescing process much
slower than them. The exponential growth ceases when
the magnitude of the current reaches the smaller of the
following two upper-limits. One is the Alfv´en current
[14], which is due to the self-generated magnetic ﬁeld
and given in Gaussian units by

IA = I0

mec3/e (

17000[A]), βk is the magnitude of
where I0
≈
the z-component of β, and the angle brackets
denotes
taking the average over the beam volume. While this
limit was originally derived for a monoenergetic, single-
directed particle beam, if there is a typical value of γβk,
it is applicable to the cases where the separation process
is going on and a fraction of particles carry the current
backwardly, because the self-generated magnetic ﬁeld is
relevant to the net current I and it always acts so that I
does not exceed IA. The other is the maximum current
that all the particles within the beam can carry, IP :

IP = πr2JP , where JP ≡

eµneh

c.
βki

(3)

Here, µ = 1 for electron-proton plasmas, and µ = 2 for
electron-positron plasmas. This limit is reached when
the separation of the current density is completed before
I reaches IA. Note that IP depends on r and µ, while
IA does not. Since the distribution of the particles in

the beam approaches an isotropic distribution according
as the instability evolves, we must take account of this
eﬀect; here, it is expressed by a factor χ as follows:

γβki

(4)

where the subscript ‘0’ denotes the initial value. Clearly,
χ must satisfy the condition 1/3 < χ < 1.

After the exponential growth ceases, the beam evolves
through the coalescing process. The evolution depends
on the current limitation types.
In the former case
(IA < IP ), which is called the Alfv´en-limit here, once
the current reaches the Alfv´en current IA, it no longer
increases and it retains the value of IA, while the radius
continues growing. Therefore, from Eq. (1), the magnetic
ﬁeld decreases monotonically after this time. In the lat-
ter case (IA > IP ), which is called the particle-limit here,
the current continues growing gradually until it reaches
the Alfv´en current; during this period, the current in-
creases with the radius keeping the condition I = πr2JP ,
and the magnetic ﬁeld also increases. After the current
reaches the Alfv´en current, the magnetic ﬁeld decreases
monotonically, as in the Alfv´en-limit.

Therefore, for both limitation types, the magnetic ﬁeld
reaches the maximum value when the current evolves to
the Alfv´en current. From Eq. (1), the maximum value
Bmax is written as

In the Alfv´en-limit, the radius at the saturation, ˜rA, is
related to the initial radius r0 or the wavelength of the
most unstable mode in the linear theory, λ0. Here, it is
simply expressed using two factors α and ζ as

˜rA = αr0 = αζλ0.

As already stated, the values of Bmax in Eqs. (8) and
(10) can be regarded as a typical magnetic ﬁeld of the
whole plasma at saturation in the respective cases. These
expressions have two parameters, cA and χP , which are
expected to be of the order of unity. The ratio of the

Comparison with numerical simulations — Here, the
results of the analytical model developed above are com-
pared with those from numerical simulations for electron-
positron plasmas and electron-proton plasmas (mp/me =
1836). The simulation code used is a relativistic, electro-
magnetic, particle-in-cell code with two spatial and three
velocity dimensions (see, e.g., [15]). The simulation plane
is taken on the x-y plane perpendicular to the z-axis. The
initial particle distribution was given in terms of the nor-
malized momentum u
γβ and common for all species.
Each component of u obeys a Gaussian distribution with
a standard deviation of σk for the z-component, or σ⊥
for the other components. Simulations were performed
for several values of σk with ﬁxed σ⊥ = 0.1.
In each
simulation, the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld strength
averaged over the simulation box was monitored and its
maximum value was obtained. Figure 1 shows the ob-
tained maximum values by dots as a function of the ini-

curves are in good agreement with the simulation re-
sults in their respective regions, especially in the particle-
limit regime. It is evident that there are two saturation
regimes. We also see that the assumption of the con-
stancy of cA and χP is good over wide range of anisotropy
in both ﬁgures, although the theoretical curves slightly
deviate from the simulation results in weak anisotropic
side. Note that, since the expression for the Alfv´en-limit
in Eq. (12) is obtained using the non-relativistic linear
theory, the relativistic dispersion relation must be em-
ployed for σ⊥ > 1 or σk > 1.

and ˜rP [Eq. (9)]). Figure 2(b) shows the current per
beam at saturation normalized by the Alfv´en current es-
timated using the radius of Eq. (13). We can see that the
theoretical model is basically consistent with the simula-
tions. Figure 3 shows the current density at saturation
obtained from the simulations for three cases: (a) Alfv´en-
limit regime, (b) Particle-limit regime, and (c) the tran-
sition point. It is evident that the saturation occurred

axis, the condition is given by that the time to the satu-
ration, tsat, is shorter than the deﬂection time by the
ω−1
ce , where ωce =
background magnetic ﬁeld, tB0 ≈
eB0/(γmec). For the Alfv´en-limit, we can approximate
Γ−1 ln(Bmax/Bseed), where Bseed is seed ﬂuctua-
tsat
tion and Γ is the largest linear growth rate. Thus, the
condition is written as Γ/ωce > ln(Bmax/Bseed)
a few.
For the particle-limit, the simulation results show tsat
is not so large compared with the time when the ex-
ponential growth ceases (about double for the largest
anisotropy), so it also gives a rough condition for this

≈

4

case. The above should be regarded as the most conser-
vative condition and it would be relaxed when the back-
ground ﬁeld is oriented nearly parallel to the z-axis.

It can be shown that the model presented here is
consistent with several conditions obtained previously.
Medvedev and Loeb [5] proposed that the saturation oc-
curs when the eﬀective Larmor radius rL(B) becomes
comparable to the most unstable wavelength in the linear
theory, λ0. If λ0 is replaced by the typical beam radius at
saturation, ˜r, we obtain the condition of rL(Bmax)
˜r,
which is qualitatively equivalent to the condition (5).
Califano et al. [12] also found that the saturation occurs
when the eﬀective Larmor radius becomes comparable to
the skin depth l0. This is in agreement with the result of
the particle-limit in Eq. (9).

≈

In electron-proton plasmas, if protons have the same
initial velocity distribution as electrons, the upper-limits
for the proton currents will be given by I ′
A = (mp/me)IA
and I ′
P = IP with µ = 1. Thus, for the particle-limit,
mp/me times larger than
both ˜rP and Bmax would be
those for the electron currents. The Alfv´en-limit cannot
be discussed here because how ˜rA is determined has not
yet been elucidated for proton currents.

p

In conclusion, the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the
Weibel instability saturates when the currents in the
beams evolve to the Alfv´en current, and there are two sat-
uration regimes: the Alfv´en-limit and the particle-limit.

Diﬀerential geometric and topological methods with
MHD and plasma physics constraints

L.C. Garcia de Andrade1

Abstract

Non-solitonic examples of the application of geometrical and topological
methods in plasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are given.
The ﬁrst example considers the generalization of magnetic helicity to grav-
itational torsion loop. The second example considers also the application
of this same torsion loop metric to some problems of helical ﬁelds in MHD
dynamo theory. In the last example a Riemannian magnetic metric is given
where the magnetic ﬁeld itself is present in the diagonal time-independent
metric. In this example the MHD equations are shown to be compatible to
the geometrical Bianchi identity by making use of Cartan’s diﬀerential cal-
culus formalism. The Riemann curvature of the helical ﬂow is also obtained.

1 Introduction

In recent years several examples [1, 2, 3, 4] of the use of diﬀerential geomet-
rical and topological methods have been presented in the literature, ranging
from the Schief’s generation of toroidal ﬂux surfaces in MHD via soliton
theory [1] and the hidden integrability in ideal MHD using the Pohlmeyer-
Lund-Regge to the solar physics magnetic topology applications considered
by Moﬀatt and Ricca [3] and Field and Berger [4]. In all these example the
diﬀerential geometry of curves and surfaces [5] were used. Earlier Sivaram
and Garcia de Andrade [6] have used non-Riemannian geometry with torsion
to investigate the Debye problem in plasma physics. Those previous work
using soliton theory in MHD of course made use of the Riemannian geometry
of surfaces where the only torsion that appears was the Serret-Frenet scalar
torsion and not the higher-dimensional [7] lie Cartan [9] torsion with the ex-
ception of reference [6]. In this paper we strike back to the non-Riemannian
geometry endowed with Cartan vectorial torsion to investigate torsion loops
, previously investigated by Letelier [9] in the context of gravitational physics
such as Einstein-Cartan gravity, now also in the context of MHD, by substi-
tuting the vector ﬁeld in this metric by the magnetic ﬁeld itself. We also show
that it is possible to generalised the magnetic-helicity topological aspects of
plasma physics can be carried over to gravitational physics. Another inter-
esting example is the diagonal Riemannian magnetic metric. This spacetime
metric instead of satisfying the Einstein equations ,or either Einstein-Cartan
equations in the case of non-Riemannian loops, it fulﬁlls the MHD equations,
that is the reason why be called magnetic metric. The magnetic metric also
constrain the Bianchi identity via MHD dynamo equation [10, 11]. The ideas
applied here in the context of MHD and plasma physics keep resemblance
with the analog gravity models which compare ﬂuid mechanics and condensed
matter systems such as BEC to the Riemannian [12] and non-Riemannian
[13] acoustic metrics. The basic diﬀerence is that here we use a magnetic
eﬀective metric instead an acoustic one. Eﬀective metrics in MHD maybe
constructed, in near future by making use of the Navier-Stokes equation of
viscous ﬂows with nonlinear magnetic ﬁelds term. More recently we have
shown that the non-Riemannian structure called acoustic torsion may also
exist in this same case. The paper is organised as follows : In the section 2 we
present the magnetic topology generalisation to gravitational torsion loops.
In this section we also deal with the non-Riemannian loop magnetic metric

constrained by the MHD equations of dynamo theory. Section 3 shows that
the more simple Riemannian geometry can take care of the MHD equations
by making use of a time-independent diagonal metric. In section 4 discussions
and conclusions are presented.

2 Magnetic-like topology of torsion loops

The Letelier teleparallel torsion loop metric is given by equation

ds2 = (dt + ~B.d~x)2 − d~x2

(1)

when this metric is used on the Cartan’s structure equation of the diﬀerential
forms a vector relationship similar to the magnetic ﬁeld derivative appears
as

~J = ∇× ~B
(2)
where ~J is the gravitational analog to the magnetic ﬁeld while ~B is the
gravitational analog of the vector potential.
It is clear that in analogy of
magnetism we here also possess a vector gauge ﬁeld where ~B → ~B + ∇ǫ.
From expression (2) we note that the torsion curve is really closed since the
torsion vector ﬁeld is divergence-free : ∇. ~J = 0. Of course now one can
easily show that by deﬁning the gravitational helicity by

Hg =

Z

~B. ~J d3x

(3)

(4)

By analogy with the Berger and Field work [1] one has for the change in H
according to the gauge freedom transformation that

∆Hg =

Z

∇ǫ. ~J d3x =

∇.(ǫ ~J )d3x =

ǫ ~J .~ndS

Z

Z

Where the integration of the ﬁrst two integrals is on total volume of space
V otherwise the ﬁeld lines would close outside V. The Stokes theorem has
also been used to obtain the last integral. Note, however, that only when
the torsion vector is orthogonal to the vector ~n the helicity is conserved. To
try to remedy this situation in the next section we drop the teleparallelism
condition Rµ
αβγ = 0 (here α, β represents the four-dimensional spacetime co-
ordinates) and consider the computation of other torsion components where

3

the helicity of the metric appears explicitly. Although the spacetime metric
(1) is invariant with respect to a general coordinate transformation as should
be the line elements in Riemannian geometry, it is not invariant with respect
to above gauge transformations, and the torsion loop metric becomes

g00 = 1

g0i = Bi + ∂iǫ
gij = −δij + BiBj

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

where here ν, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 and latin indices takes values from one to three.
It is clear that this metric exhibit explicitely the gauge freedom scalar. From
the metric components is easy to compute the following components of the
Cartan torsion tensor

Ti0j =

[∂ig0j − ∂jg0i] =

[∂iBj − ∂jBi]

This expression can be recast in a more ellegant form by writing it in vector
form as

where the Einstein summation convention was used in this last expression.
Finally the last component of Cartan torsion is

[∇× ~B]l

Ti0i = 0

ǫlkjTkij =

[∂iǫ(∇× ~B)l]

where ǫkli is the Levi-Civita symbol. From this last expresion we not that
by contracting the indices l = i we note that a new generalised deﬁnition of
gravitational helicity can be obtained since

ǫikjTkijd3x =

∇ǫ.∇× ~Bd3x = Hg

Z

2 Z

which shows that this new deﬁnition coincides with the old with the advan-
tage that now the full torsion tensor is consider and not only the torsion
vector part. Since the component Ti0j can also be expressed in terms of the

4

Z

ǫlijBlTi0jd3x =

vector ~J one may express the gravitational helicity by yet another integral
as

[ ~B.∇× ~B]d3x = Hg

2 Z
In the next section we propose a solution for the problem of helicity in
Riemann-Cartan spacetime.
In this section we show that it is possible to
show that gravitational helicity is conserved as long as we extend the space-
time to a more general Riemann-Cartan one instead of the teleparallel space-
time. It is easy to show that by considering the torsion loop metric (1) in
diﬀerential forms notation

(13)

ds2 = (ω0)2 − (ω1)2 − (ω2)2 − (ω3)2

where the basis one-forms are

ω0 = (dt + ~B.d~x)

and ω1 = dx, ω2 = dy and ω3 = dz. Now a small perturbation of connection
one-forms in the teleparallel case according to the formula

ǫin

lp[ ~J0]mωn

~J0 = ~J − ∇× ~B

where the new torsion vector ﬁeld now in RC spacetime ~J0 is given in terms
of the old teleparallel vector ﬁeld by

Note from this expression that the vector torsion ﬁeld ~J0 represents also a
loop since

∇. ~J0 = ∇. ~J = 0
(18)
where we have used the fact that ∇.[∇× ~B] = 0. Note also that now the new
deﬁnition of helicity similar to the previous one is

H RC

g =

Z

~B. ~J0d3x

From this deﬁnition of helicity , where ~J was simply replaced by ~J0, one is
able to obtain the new expression for the variation of the helicity by

∆H RC

g = Z

∇ǫ. ~J0d3x = Z

∇.(ǫ ~J0)d3x = Z

ǫ ~J0.~ndS

(20)

(14)

(15)

(17)

(19)

Note that from expressions (20) and (19) it is possible to obtain

~n. ~J0 = ~n. ~J − ~n.[∇× ~B] = 0

This expression and (20) together lead to the conservation of the helicity in
Riemann-Cartan spacetime given by

∆H RC

g = 0

One must notice that the condition that leads to this conservation does not
imply that the torsion vector ~J is now orthogonal to the static torsion loop
plane, which solves the contradiction this would imply in teleparallel space-
time.
In the spirit of this sectiona non-Riemannian loop magnetic metric
can be obtained from the Letelier metric (1), the only diﬀerence, however, is
that now the vector ~B in the metric coeﬁcient is a true magnetic ﬁeld. This
choice is very convenient since by makind use of Cartan’s calculus of diﬀeren-
tial forms Letelier relation (2) is identical to the magnetic equation where the
torsion vector ﬁeld ~J is now equivalent to a electric current. Therefore in this
case our system is equivalent to a circular current carrying loop generating
magnetic ﬁelds. In the next section makes use of another magnetic metric
where now the metric is Riemannian and the MHD equations is consider to
constrain the Cartan’s equations. The advantage of considering ~B as a real
magnetic ﬁeld is that relation (2) then implies a dynamo generating magnetic
ﬁleld from Cartan torsion. This idea has been fully sustained by De Sabbata
and Gasperini [14]and more recently by Opher and Wichoski [15].

3 Riemannian magnetic metrics in MHD

In this section we shall consider the diagonal magnetic metric given by the
following line element in cylindrical coordinates adequate to treat the geom-
etry of tubes in plasma physics

ds2 = dt2 − Br

2dr2 − Bθ

2r2dθ2 − Bz

2dz2

where the basis one-forms are given by

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

ω0 = dt

By making use of the ﬁrst Cartan’s structure equation

T α = dωα + ωα

β∧ωβ

where the symbol ∧ means the exterior product and ωβ
γ represents the con-
nection one-form and T β represents the Cartan torsion two-form. All com-
ponents of the magnetic ﬁeld depends only upon the radial coordinate r.
Since the metric is Riemannian the torsion forms vanish and this can be
used together with the MHD equations for helical ﬁelds to constrain the ge-
ometry and to ﬁnd out the Riemann curvature of the magnetic metrics. To
able to accomplish this task we consider the following MHD equations in the
steady-state case leading to the phenomelogical Maxwell equation

where k is a constant. By considering the helical ﬂow [11]

where ω and v are constants. These vectors used in equation (29) yields the
following conditions

Here the upper prime represents derivation with respect to the radial coor-
dinate r. By making use of the solenoid condition ∇. ~B = 0 one obtains the
following solution of the helical MHD ﬂow

ω1 = Brdr
ω2 = Bθrdθ
ω3 = Bzdz

k~v× ~B = ∇× ~B

~B = (Br, Bθ, Bz)

To apply this MHD solution to constrain our Riemannian magnetic geometry
one needs before to substitute the basis one forms into the Cartan equation
(28) which yields

r∧ωr + ωt

T t = ωt
T θ = dωθ + ωθ
T z = ωz
T r = ωr

r∧ωr + ωz

where the only nonvanishing exterior derivative of the basis one-form is

Substitution of (42) into (39) yields the only nonvanishing component of the
connection one-form

where ci with (i = 1, 2, 3) are the integration constants. Substitution of
Maxwell equation (34) into expression (43) yields the following constraint of
MHD equations to the Riemannian geometry of magnetic metric

which from the second Cartan’s structure equation

yields

which along with the deﬁnition of the curvature two-form

yields the following component for the Riemann tensor of the magnetic man-
ifold

which is equivalent to the expression for the Riemann curvature of the mag-
netic manifold

rθz = −2kv(r)

(49)

This is the Riemannian curvature of the helical MHD ﬂow. A similar relation
between the curvature of intratube and the velocity of the ﬂow has been
obtained previously by Pelz [16] in the context of vortex ﬁlament models. A
particular case of the above Riemannian MHD metric maybe consider as

ds2 = dt2 − dx2 − By

2dy2 − dz2

(50)

where we have consider now the Cartesian retangular coordinates (x, y, z)
for the spatial part of the magnetic metric. Here the only nonvanishing
component of the magnetic ﬁeld is given by By(x, y). By again making use
of Cartan’s calculus of diﬀerential forms yields the following equations

ω3

2 = [∇× ~B]zdx

which in turn yields the following Bianchi identity

dR3

2 = dω3

2 = ∂y∂z[∇× ~B]zdy∧dx∧dz

By considering equation (29) one obtains the equation

dR3

2 = dω3

2 = ∂y∂z[k~v× ~B]zdy∧dx∧dz = 0

(51)

(52)

(53)

which is consistent with the Bianchi identity dRα
β = 0 where d is the exterior
derivative. In all the above example we found out an interesting interplay
between the equations of plasma physics and the geometrical equations of
the Cartan’s calculus of diﬀerential forms.

4 conclusions

A natural extension of the magnetic topology of torsion loops to investigate
knots in MHD can be undertaken by generalising the static Letelier’s tor-
sion loops to time-dependent torsion loops. This extension unfortunately
has been proved very diﬃcult [17] even by modern computation techniques
using the OrtoCartan program. Non-Riemannian geometry and topology

9

of torsion curves is discussed. A new deﬁnition of the magnetic-like grav-
itational helicity is proposed. We show that the extension of teleparallel
spacetime to Riemann-Cartan spacetime allows us to possible applications
of the mathematics discussed here in astrophysical models may be proposed
in near future. Solitonic equations in non-Riemannian background may also
be considered in near future.

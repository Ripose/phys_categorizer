Abstract

We develop a covariant density matrix approach to kinetic theory of QED plasmas
subjected into a strong external electromagnetic ﬁeld. A canonical quantization of
the system on space-like hyperplanes in Minkowski space and a covariant general-
ization of the Coulomb gauge is used. The condensate mode associated with the
mean electromagnetic ﬁeld is separated from the photon degrees of freedom by a
time-dependent unitary transformation of both, the dynamical variables and the
nonequilibrium statistical operator. Therefore even in the case of strong external
ﬁelds a perturbative expansion in orders of the ﬁne structure constant for the cor-
relation functions as well as the statistical operator is applicable. A general scheme
for deriving kinetic equations in the hyperplane formalism is presented.

1 Introduction

In recent years the theoretical study of dense relativistic plasmas is of in-
creasing interest. Such plasmas are not only limited to astrophysics, but can
nowadays be produced by high-intense short-pulse lasers [1,2]. In view of the

inertial conﬁnement fusion, one has to consider a plasma under extreme con-
ditions which is created by a strong external ﬁeld. This new experimental
progress needs a systematic approach based on quantum electrodynamics and
methods of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.

Considerable attention has been focussed on a mean-ﬁeld (Vlasov-type) kinetic
equation for the fermionic Wigner function, which is an essential step towards
transport theory of laser-induced QED plasmas. Using the Wigner operator
deﬁned in four-dimensional momentum space [3–5], a manifestly covariant
mean-ﬁeld kinetic equation can be derived from the Heisenberg equations of
motion for the ﬁeld operators. In this approach, however, it is diﬃcult to
formulate an initial value problem for the kinetic equation since the four-
dimensional Fourier transformation in the covariant Wigner function includes
integration of two-point correlation functions over time. This diﬃculty does
not appear in the scheme based on the one-time fermionic Wigner function
where the ﬁeld operators are taken at the same time and only the spatial
Fourier transformation is performed. In the context of QED, the one-time
formulation was proposed by Bialynicki-Birula et al. [6] (referred to in the
following as BGR) and used successfully in their study of the electron-positron
vacuum. Within this approach one can explore a number of attractive features.
The one-time Wigner function has a direct physical interpretation and allows
to calculate local observables, such as the charge density and the current
density. The description in terms of one-time quantities is quite natural in
kinetic theory based on the von Neumann equation for the statistical operator
and provides a consistent account of causality in collision integrals.

It should be noted, however, that the one-time Wigner function does not con-
tain a complete information about one-particle dynamics; the spectral prop-
erties of correlation functions can be described only in terms of two-point
Green’s functions which are closely related to the covariant Wigner function.
Recently this aspect of relativistic kinetic theory was studied within the mean-
ﬁeld approximation [7,8]. The aforementioned incompleteness of the one-time
description is well known in non-relativistic kinetic theory, where two-time
correlation functions can, in principle, be reconstructed from the one-time
Wigner function by solving integral equations which follow from the Dyson
equation for nonequilibrium Green’s functions [9]. The reconstruction problem
in relativistic kinetic theory remains to be explored. The solution of this prob-
lem requires a further development of the relativistic density matrix method
as well as the relativistic Green’s function technique.

In this and subsequent papers we develop a density matrix approach to kinetic
theory of QED plasma subjected into a strong electromagnetic ﬁeld. From the
conceptual point of view, our aim is to generalize the BGR scheme [6] in two
aspects. First, we wish to present the one-time formalism in covariant form.
This removes a drawback of the BGR theory which is not manifestly covariant.

2

Second, we will develop a scheme which allows to go beyond the mean-ﬁeld
approximation, including dissipative processes in QED plasma and the inter-
play between collisions and the mean-ﬁeld eﬀects. Whereas subsequent papers
will concern with explicit kinetic equations, the present ﬁrst part considers
some general problems of the one-time covariant approach to relativistic ki-
netic theory. In comparison to QED where the main object is the S-matrix
constructed from vacuum averages of the ﬁeld operators, kinetic theory of
QED deals with averages over a nonequilibrium ensemble describing a many-
body system. Therefore we use the Hamiltonian formalism which is typical for
the density matrix method. In this case, however, one meets with some funda-
mental problems which are considered in this paper. In order that the theory
be manifestly covariant, canonical quantization of the system will be carried
out in a covariant fashion. Another point is that, in the presence of a strong
electromagnetic ﬁeld, perturbation expansions in the ﬁne structure constant
are not suitable. To overcome this diﬃculty, we will present a procedure which
allows to separate the classical part of the electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld and the
photon degrees of freedom at any time.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we brieﬂy sketch a scheme
of relativistic statistical mechanics in the form adapted to kinetic theory. In
our approach we use a manifestly covariant Schr¨odinger picture on space-
like hyperplanes in Minkowski space. Analogous formulations of relativistic
quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory can be found in literature for
various applications (see, e.g., [10–14]). In this way, “equal-time” correlation
functions are deﬁned with respect to the “ invariant time” variable on a hyper-
plane. In Section 3 we perform canonical quantization of QED on space-like
hyperplanes and derive the covariant quantum Hamiltonian. Section 4 deals
with the condensate mode which corresponds to the electromagnetic ﬁeld in-
duced by the polarization in the system. The condensate mode is eliminated
by a time-dependent unitary transformation of the statistical operator and
dynamical variables. As a result, we obtain the eﬀective Hamiltonian, where
the interaction of fermions with the mean electromagnetic ﬁeld is incorpo-
rated non-perturbatively at any time, while the interaction between fermions
and photons is described by a term which can be taken into account within
perturbation theory. It is shown how Maxwell equations for the mean electro-
magnetic ﬁeld are recovered in our scheme. In Section 5 the covariant one-time
Wigner function and the photon density matrix are introduced and a method
for deriving kinetic equations in the hyperplane formalism is outlined. We
conclude the paper with a few remarks concerning our results and further
applications.

We use the system of units with c = ¯h = 1. The signature of the metric tensor
is (+, −, −, −).

2 Nonequilibrium statistical operator in the hyperplane formalism

2.1 The relativistic von Neumann equation

It is well known that in the special theory of relativity a quantum state of a
system is deﬁned by a complete set of commuting observables which can be
associated with a three-parameter space-like surface σ in Minkowski space.
Among these surfaces three-dimensional hyperplanes are especially easy to
deal with [10–13]. Since the use of arbitrary space-like surfaces does not lead
to new physics, in what follows we restrict our consideration to hyperplanes.
A space-like hyperplane σ ≡ σn,τ is characterized by a unit time-like normal
vector nµ and a scalar parameter τ which may be interpreted as an “ invariant
time”. The equation of the hyperplane σn,τ reads

x · n = τ,

n2 = nµnµ = 1.

(2.1)

In the special Lorentz frame where nµ = (1, 0, 0, 0), Eq. (2.1) reads x0 = τ ; in
this frame the parameter τ coincides with the time variable t = x0. By treat-
ing a state vector |Ψ[σn,τ ]i as a functional of σn,τ , the covariant Schr¨odinger
equation can be derived from the relation between the state vector on the hy-
perplane σ and the state vector on the hyperplane σ′ = Lσ which is obtained
by an inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation L = {a, Λ}:

σ → σ′ = Lσ :

x → x′ = Λx + a.

The relation between the state vectors is [15]

U(L) |Ψ[Lσ]i = |Ψ[σ]i ,

where U(L) = U(a, Λ) is a unitary representation of the inhomogeneous
Lorentz group. The generators of this representation, ˆP µ and ˆM µν , are the
energy-momentum vector and the angular momentum tensor, respectively. For
our purposes, the only transformations of relevance are pure time-like trans-
lations which change the value of τ . Recalling the form of U(a, Λ) for pure
translations

(2.4)

and introducing the notation
for an inﬁnitesimal time-like translation aµ = nµ δτ as

|Ψ(n, τ + δτ )i + iδτ

ˆH(n) = ˆPµnµ.

In the presence of a prescribed external ﬁeld, the energy-momentum vector
and, consequently, the Hamiltonian ˆH τ (n) can depend explicitly on τ . Com-
bining Eq. (2.6) with the adjoint equation for the bra-vector, one ﬁnds that the
statistical operator ̺(n, τ ) for a mixed quantum ensemble obeys the equation

∂̺(n, τ )

which is analogous to the non-relativistic von Neumann equation.

2.2 Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures on hyperplanes

The evolution of a mixed ensemble on space-like hyperplanes can be repre-
sented in diﬀerent pictures. The statistical operator in the Heisenberg picture
does not depend on the parameter τ and is associated with some ﬁxed hy-
perplane σn,τ0. Dynamical variables are represented by operators ˆOH([σn,τ ])
which are functionals of the hyperplanes. Of particular interest in quantum
ﬁeld theory are local operators ˆOH(x) which depend on the space-time point
x. In what follows it will be convenient to treat such operators as functions
of the parameter τ . To deﬁne this dependence, we introduce the transverse
projector with respect to the normal vector nµ,

∆µ

ν = δµ

ν − nµnν,

(2.9)

and notice that a space-time four-vector xµ can be represented in the form

xµ = nµτ + xµ
⊥,

τ = n · x,

(2.10)

where

⊥ = ∆µ
xµ

ν xν

5

(2.11)

is the transverse (space-like) component of x. Geometrically, Eq. (2.10) means
that the space-like vector xµ
⊥ lies on the hyperplane σn,τ passing through the
space-time point x. Using the decomposition (2.10), a local Heisenberg oper-
ator ˆOH(x) can be written as

ˆOH(x) = ˆOH(nτ + x⊥) ≡ ˆOH(τ, x⊥).

(2.12)

Let us assume that ˆP µ does not depend explicitly on τ . Then, recalling the
well-known equation of motion for Heisenberg operators

∂µ

ˆOH(x) = −i[ ˆOH(x), ˆPµ] ,

(2.13)

one readily ﬁnds that the time-like evolution of such operators is described by
the equation

ˆOH(τ, x⊥) = ei(τ −τ0) ˆH(n) ˆOH(τ0, x⊥) e−i(τ −τ0) ˆH(n)

(2.14)

with the Hamiltonian (2.7). The generalization of Eq. (2.14) to situations in
which the Hamiltonian ˆH τ depends explicitly on τ is obvious. Deﬁning the
evolution operator U(τ, τ ′; n) as the ordered exponent

U(τ, τ ′; n) = Tτ exp

−i

ˆH ¯τ (n) d¯τ

(2.15)



we have

ˆOH(τ, x⊥) = U †(τ, τ0; n) ˆOH(τ0, x⊥) U (τ, τ0; n).

(2.16)

In the Schr¨odinger picture, the statistical operator ̺(n, τ ) is τ -dependent and
its time-like evolution is governed by Eq. (2.8), whereas operators ˆOS are
deﬁned on a ﬁxed hyperplane. Assuming the Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger pic-
tures to coincide on the hyperplane σn,τ0, Eq. (2.16) implies that the transition
from the Schr¨odinger picture to the Heisenberg picture is given by

ˆOH(τ, x⊥) = U †(τ, τ0; n) ˆOS(x⊥) U (τ, τ0; n).

(2.17)

The mean values O(x) of local dynamical variables can be calculated in both
pictures. Using a formal solution of Eq. (2.8)

̺(n, τ ) = U(τ, τ0; n) ̺(n, τ0) U †(τ, τ0; n),

(2.18)

6

we ﬁnd that

O(x) = h ˆOH(τ, x⊥)iτ0 = h ˆOS(x⊥)iτ .

(2.19)

Here and in what follows the symbol h· · ·iτ stands for averages calculated with
the statistical operator ̺(n, τ ). In many problems one is dealing with partial
derivatives ∂µO(x) which enter the equations of motion for local observables.
In the hyperplane formalism, it is convenient to express the partial derivatives
in terms of the derivatives with respect to τ and x⊥. Recalling Eqs. (2.10)
and (2.11), we write

∂µ = nµ

+ ∇µ,

∇µ = ∆ ν

µ ∂ν = ∆ ν

(2.20)

(2.22)

In the Schr¨odinger picture, the τ -dependence of the mean values appears
through the statistical operator which obeys the von Neumann equation (2.8).
Nevertheless, in this picture from Eq. (2.19) we obtain a similar equation of
motion

∂µO(x) =

2.3 “Equal-time” correlation functions

Describing the evolution of the system in terms of hyperplanes, we can in-
troduce “equal-time” correlation functions of local dynamical variables with
respect to the invariant time τ . Let ˆO1H(x), ˆO2H(x), . . . , ˆOkH(x) be some local

7

Heisenberg operators. Then the “equal-time” correlation function for these
operators can be deﬁned as

F1···k(x1⊥, . . . , xk⊥; n, τ ) = h ˆO1H(x1) · · · ˆOkH(xk)iτ0,

(2.25)

where n · x1 = n · x2 = . . . = n · xk = τ . In the Schr¨odinger picture this
correlation function takes the form

F1···k(x1⊥, . . . , xk⊥; n, τ ) = h ˆO1S(x1⊥) · · · ˆOkS(xk⊥)iτ .

(2.26)

The covariant von Neumann equation (2.8) yields the equations

∂
∂τ

F1···k(x1⊥, . . . , xk⊥; n, τ ) = −ih[ ˆO1S(x1⊥) · · · ˆOkS(xk⊥), ˆH τ (n)]iτ

(2.27)

which can serve as a starting point for constructing the quantum hierarchy
for the “equal-time” correlation functions.

3 Hamiltonian of QED on hyperplanes

We will now apply the foregoing scheme to a relativistic system of charged
fermions interacting through the EM ﬁeld. For deﬁniteness, we take these
fermions to be electrons and positrons, so that protons will be treated as a
positively charged background which ensures electric neutrality of the system.
There is no diﬃculty in describing protons by an additional Dirac ﬁeld. Having
in mind applications to relativistic plasmas produced by high-intense shot-
pulse lasers, we assume the system to be subjected into a prescribed external
EM ﬁeld which is not necessarily weak.

3.1 The Lagrangian density

The ﬁrst step in formulating the kinetic theory of QED plasma is to construct
the Hamiltonian ˆH(n). We start with the classical Lagrange density

L(x) = LD(x) + LEM (x) + Lint(x) + Lext(x),

(3.1)

where LD(x) and LEM (x) are the Lagrangian densities of free Dirac and EM
ﬁelds respectively, Lint(x) is the interaction Lagrangian density, and the term
Lext(x) describes the interaction of fermions with the external electromagnetic
ﬁeld. In standard notation (see, e.g., [16]), we have

where
taken in the form Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ. The current density four-vector will
be expressed as jµ = e ¯ψγµψ with e < 0. We wish to remark that in our
approach the four-potential of the EM ﬁeld is decomposed into two terms. The
variables Aµ(x) correspond to the EM ﬁeld caused by charges and currents in
the system, while Aµ
ext(x) is a prescribed external ﬁeld. In what follows, only
the dynamical ﬁeld Aµ(x) will be quantized.

3.2 Canonical quantization on hyperplanes

A canonical quantization implies that some gauge ﬁxing condition is im-
posed on Aµ. For many-particle systems studied in statistical mechanics, the
Coulomb gauge seems to be the most natural. However, the disadvantage of
this gauge is that it is not manifestly covariant. Therefore we will use a general-
ization of the Coulomb gauge condition which is consistent with the covariant
description of evolution in terms of space-like hyperplanes. To formulate this
condition, we introduce for any four-vector V µ the decomposition into the
transverse and longitudinal parts by

V µ = nµVk + V µ
⊥ ,

Vk = nνV ν,

⊥ = ∆µ
V µ

νV ν,

(3.6)

where ∆µ
gauge condition reads

ν is the projector (2.9). Then a natural generalization of the Coulomb

∇µAµ

⊥ = 0.

(3.7)

In the special frame where nµ = (1, 0, 0, 0) and Aµ = (A0, A), Eq. (3.7) reduces
to ∇ · A = 0, which is the usual Coulomb gauge condition.

To deﬁne canonical variables for the electromagnetic ﬁeld on a hyperplane
σn,τ , we ﬁrst perform the decomposition (3.6) of the ﬁeld variables Aµ and the
decomposition (2.20) of the derivatives in the Euler-Lagrange equations

∂L

where we use the notation ˙f ≡ ∂f /∂τ for derivatives with respect to τ . Equa-
tion (3.9) allows to eliminate the variable Ak in the Lagrangian. First we
rewrite expressions (3.3) and (3.4) in terms of Ak and Aµ
⊥ using the decom-
position procedure for the derivatives and the ﬁeld Aµ. As a result we obtain
the Lagrangian density in the form

Note that the last two terms in Eq. (3.11) do not contain Ak and Aµ
⊥. Now
using the expression (3.11) to calculate derivatives in Eq. (3.9) and taking into
account that, according to the gauge condition (3.7), ∇µ

⊥ = 0, we get

˙Aµ

∇µ∇µAk = jk.

In the frame where nµ = (1, 0, 0, 0), this reduces to the Poisson equation for
A0. The solution of Eq. (3.13) is

The variable Ak can now be eliminated in the Lagrangian density (3.11) with
the aid of Eq. (3.14). Terms like ∇ν(· · ·) can be dropped since they do not con-

We will treat the ﬁelds Aµ
⊥ as dynamical variables for EM ﬁeld and follow the
Dirac version of canonical quantization of theories with constraints [17,18].
The gauge condition (3.7) is one of the constraint equation in this scheme.
Another constraint equation follows directly from the deﬁnition of transverse
four-vectors, Eq. (3.6), and reads

We now deﬁne canonical conjugates for the ﬁeld variables Aµ

γk = γ0 and δ3(x⊥ − x′

known anticommutation relation for the quantized Dirac ﬁeld.

Separating the longitudinal and transverse components with respect to the
normal vector nµ and then eliminating the τ -derivatives of the ﬁelds with the
aid of Eqs. (3.20) and (3.29), the classical Hamiltonian on the hyperplane is
obtained from Eq. (3.30). It can be veriﬁed that in both cases we have the
same expression for H τ (n). The ﬁnal step is to replace the canonical variables
⊥, ψ, ¯ψ by the corresponding quantum operators. As a result, we ﬁnd the

The longitudinal part ˆAk has been eliminated in the interaction Hamilto-
nian (3.35) by the equation

∇µ∇µ ˆAk = ˆj k

(3.39)

which is analogous to Eq. (3.13). As usual, in Eqs. (3.33) – (3.36) normal or-
dering in operators is implied. The self-energy contribution to the last term
in Eq. (3.35) is omitted, so that the product : ˆjk(x⊥) : : ˆjk(x′
⊥) : is under-
stood. For simplicity, we have written the Hamiltonian for the case that the
fermionic subsystem is described by one Dirac ﬁeld. The generalization to a
many-component case is obvious.

4 The condensate mode of EM ﬁeld

⊥ = h ˆΠµ

An essential feature of the dynamical evolution of QED plasma in a strong
⊥ = h ˆAµ
external ﬁeld is that the mean values of the canonical operators 4 , Aµ
⊥i
and Πµ
⊥i, just as the mean values of creation and annihilation bosonic
operators ˆa and ˆa† related to the canonical operators by plane-wave expan-
sions, are not zero. Furthermore, they are macroscopic quantities associated
with the mean EM ﬁeld induced by the polarization in the system. In the
language of statistical mechanics, the variables Aµ
⊥(x) describe a
macroscopic condensate mode of the EM ﬁeld. This fact does not allow to
apply perturbation theory directly to the Hamiltonian (3.32) because the in-
teraction of fermions with the condensate mode or, what is the same, with the
mean EM ﬁeld is not weak. So, we have to separate the condensate mode from
the photon degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian and the statistical operator.

4.1 The time-dependent unitary transformation

The condensate mode is most easily isolated by introducing the τ -dependent
unitary transformation

̺C(n, τ ) = ei ˆC(n,τ ) ̺(n, τ ) e−i ˆC(n,τ ),

(4.1)

where the operator ˆC(n, τ ) is given by

ˆC(n, τ ) =

⊥ and ˆΠµ

Thus, in the state described by the transformed statistical operator (4.1), the
canonical dynamical variables ˆAµ
⊥ have zero mean values and, hence,
they are not related to the condensate mode. In other words, after the unitary
transformation the EM ﬁeld operators correspond to the photon degrees of
freedom. Based on the above arguments, it is convenient to use ̺C(n, τ ) as the
statistical operator of the system. It should be noted, however, that ̺C(n, τ )
does not satisfy the von Neumann equation (2.8) since the operator ˆC depends
on τ . In order to derive the equation of motion for ̺C(n, τ ), we diﬀerentiate
Eq. (4.1) with respect to τ . After some algebra which we omit, we ﬁnd that the
transformed statistical operator satisﬁes the modiﬁed von Neumann equation

The transformation of ˆH(n) in the ﬁrst term is trivial due to Eqs. (4.3) and
the fact that the transformation does not aﬀect fermionic operators. It is

is that now the interaction term (4.14) does not contain a contribution from
the condensate mode and, consequently, one can use perturbation expansions
in the ﬁne structure constant.

4.2 Maxwell equations

To complete our discussion of the condensate mode, we will show how the
Maxwell equations for the total mean EM are derived in our approach. Ac-
cording to Eq. (4.12), the total ﬁeld tensor can be written as

F µν(x) = ∂µAν(x) − ∂νAµ(x) = F µν

ext(x) + F µν(x).

(4.16)

The external ﬁeld tensor F µν

ext is assumed to satisfy the Maxwell equations

∂µF µν

ext(x) = jν

ext(x)

(4.17)

with some prescribed external current jµ
ﬁeld tensor F µν(x) is the mean value of the operator

the equations of motion for the ﬁeld operators lead to the Maxwell equations
for the polarization ﬁeld tensor

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

∂µF µν(x) = jν(x).

(4.19)

17

Now Eqs. (4.17) and (4.19) can be combined into the Maxwell equations for
the total ﬁeld tensor

∂µF µν(x) = jν(x) + jν

ext(x).

(4.20)

A solution of these equations gives the total mean ﬁeld Aµ in terms of the
total mean current.

5 Kinetic description of QED plasma

5.1 The “one-time” Wigner function

Within the hyperplane formalism a natural way of describing kinetic processes
in the fermion subsystem is by the “one-time” Wigner function which depends
on the variable τ . Since there is the gauge freedom for the mean ﬁeld Aµ, it is
convenient to employ the gauge-invariant Wigner function on the hyperplane
σn,τ deﬁned as

aa′(x⊥, x′

⊥) + Kaa′(x⊥, x′

⊥),

where the last c-number term represents the vacuum expectation value of ˆf
since the vacuum expectation value of ˆf ′ is zero. It can be shown, however,
that the vacuum term in Eq. (5.6) does not contribute to local observables
like the mean current jµ(x). The advantage of the deﬁnition (5.5) is that the
mean values of one-particle dynamical variables (summation over repeated
spinor indices)

Unfortunately, the equation of motion for the density operator (5.5) with the
Hamiltonian (4.10) contains vacuum (divergent) terms. On the other hand,
such terms do not appear in the equation of motion for the operator (5.4).
For this reason, we shall take the operator (5.4) as the one-particle density
operator in Eq. (5.3). An analogous deﬁnition was used previously for the
phase-space description of the QED vacuum in a strong ﬁeld [6].

The Wigner function (5.1) is deﬁned on a given family of hyperplanes σn,τ and,
hence, depends parametrically on the normal four-vector n. It should be noted,
however, that local observables calculated from the Wigner function do not
depend on the choice of n. As an important example, the mean polarization
current (4.9) can be written in the form

jµ(x) = eh : ˆ¯ψ(x⊥)γµ ˆψ(x⊥) : iτ
d4p
(2π)3 δ(p · n) tr {γµW (x⊥, p⊥; τ = x · n)} ,

= e

Z

(5.9)

where the symbol “tr” stands for the trace over spinor indices. Geometrically,
the above relation means that, in calculating the current, the invariant time

19

τ has a value such that the space-time point x lies on the hyperplane σn,τ .

5.2 The photon density matrix

To deﬁne the photon density matrix, we start from the plane wave expansion
of the vector potential operator ˆA⊥ in terms of creation and annihilation op-
erators. By analogy with the well-known representation for the free photon
ﬁeld in the special Lorentz frame where nµ = (1, 0, 0, 0), we write

ˆAµ

the commutation relation (3.21) for the ﬁeld operators is recovered. Note that
Eqs. (5.10) and (5.13) give the ﬁeld operators in the interaction picture. The
corresponding expansions for the ﬁeld operators in the Schr¨odinger picture are
obtained by setting τ = 0. In this case the delta-function δ(qk − ωn(q⊥)) may
be replaced by δ(qk).

There are two ways to express the right-hand sides of these equations in terms
of the fermionic and photon density matrices using perturbation expansions
in the ﬁne structure constant. One method is by considering the hierarchy
for correlation functions which appear through the commutators with the
interaction Hamiltonian ˆHτ
int(n) and then employing some truncation proce-
dure. Another method is to construct an approximate solution of Eq. (4.6)
in terms of the density matrices f and N. In both cases one has to impose
some boundary conditions of the retarded type on the correlation functions
or the statistical operator. The standard boundary condition in kinetic theory
is Bogoliubov’s boundary condition of weakening of initial correlations which
implies the uncoupling of all correlation functions to one-particle density ma-
trices in the distant past, i.e., for τ → −∞. In the scheme developed by
Zubarev (see, e.g., [20]), such boundary conditions can be included by using
instead of Eq. (4.6) the equation with an inﬁnitesimally small source term

nonequilibrium state variables. In QED kinetics these variables are the Wigner

standard procedure [20], we obtain the relevant statistical operator in the form

are the “equal-time” correlation functions in which the condensate mode of
the EM ﬁeld is eliminated. Since the relevant statistical operator (5.24) ad-
mits Wick’s decomposition, the last term in Eq. (5.26) ensures the boundary
condition of complete weakening of initial correlations. Note that the explicit
knowledge of the statistical operator ̺C(n, τ ) is not needed when considering
the hierarchy for the correlation functions. Use of some truncation procedure
is a standard practice in this case. The hierarchy for correlation functions will
be discussed in subsequent papers in the context of the derivation of collision
integrals.

Another method of handling Eq. (5.23) is by considering its formal solution

The representation (5.30) for the statistical operator allows to separate the

In the presence of a strong EM ﬁeld, the evolution of the fermion subsystem
is governed predominantly by its interaction with the mean EM ﬁeld. Thus,
the covariant mean-ﬁeld kinetic equation for the Wigner function (5.1) can
be derived from Eq. (5.32) neglecting the collision integral. This kinetic equa-
tion as well as the collision integrals (5.34) and (5.35) will be considered in
subsequent papers.

6 Concluding remarks

We have shown that the hyperplane formalism can serve as the basis for ki-
netic theory of QED plasma in the presence of a strong external ﬁeld. The
formalism has the advantage that it is manifestly covariant and therefore al-
lows to introduce diﬀerent approximations in covariant form. The formalism
makes only minor changes in the non-relativistic density matrix method, so
that many well-developed approaches can be directly applied to QED plasma.
For instance, the explicit construction of the statistical operator allows to
incorporate many-particle correlations through the extension of the set of ba-
sic state parameters (see, e.g.,[20,21]). Note also that, using the Heisenberg
picture on hyperplanes, nonequilibrium Green’s functions can be introduced
with respect to the invariant time parameter τ . In such a way, the spectral
properties of microscopic dynamics can be incorporated.

Finally, we would like to emphasize once again two key problems in a covariant
density matrix approach to relativistic kinetic theory in the presence of a
strong mean ﬁeld. First, it is necessary to perform canonical quantization of
the system on a hyperplane in Minkowski space. Second, the condensate mode
must be separated from the quantum degrees of freedom at any time. We have
shown how these problems can be solved in the context of QED plasmas. As a
result, a general form of kinetic equations for fermions and photons was given.

The scheme outlined in this paper is also applicable to some quantum ﬁeld
models used in QCD transport theory. In this case the non-Abelian algebra
must be worked out to describe the quark-gluon plasma.

Commutation relations for electromagnetic ﬁeld on hyperplanes

Let us write the constraint equations for the canonical variables Aµ

with the three-dimensional delta function (3.16). All other Poisson brackets
for the canonical variables are equal to zero. In the Dirac terminology, func-
tions (A.1) correspond to second class constraints since the matrix

CN N ′(x⊥, x′

⊥) = [χN (x⊥), χN ′(x′

⊥)]P

(A.4)

is non-singular. A straightforward calculation of the Poisson brackets shows
that the non-zero elements of C are

According to the general quantization scheme [17,18], commutation relations
for canonical operators are deﬁned by the Dirac brackets for classical canonical
variables. In our case the Dirac brackets are written as

Since the matrix elements (A.5) of C depend on the diﬀerence x⊥ − x′
⊥,
Eq. (A.7) can be solved for C −1 using a Fourier transform on σn,τ , which

26

is deﬁned for any function f (x) as

˜f(τ, p⊥) =

d4x eip·x δ(x · n − τ ) f (x).

The inverse transform is

f (x) ≡ f (τ, x⊥) =

If we perform the Fourier transformation in Eq. (A.7), we ﬁnd by insert-
ing (A.5) that the non-zero elements of C −1 are

Now the Dirac brackets (A.6) for the canonical variables are easily calculated
and we obtain

(A.11)

(A.12)

where the functions cµν(x⊥ − x′
⊥) are given by Eq. (3.23). According to the
general quantization rules, the commutation relations for canonical operators
correspond to i[. . .]D. Thus, in the hyperplane formalism, the commutation
relations for the operators of EM ﬁeld are given by (3.21) and (3.22). Obviously
these relations are valid in the Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures.

Anticommutation relations for the Dirac ﬁeld on hyperplanes

To ﬁnd the anticommutation relations for the fermion operators on the hyper-
plane σn,τ , it is suﬃcient to consider a free Dirac ﬁeld. Our starting point
is the standard quantization scheme in the frame where xµ = (t, r) and
nµ = (1, 0, 0, 0) (see, e.g., [16]). In that case the ﬁeld operators ˆψa and ˆ¯ψa

27

can be written in terms of creation and annihilation operators according to

The anticommutation relation on the hyperplane σn,τ is now obtained by set-

to use a decomposition pµ = nµpk + pµ

Finally, changing the variable p⊥ → −p⊥ in the second integral in Eq. (B.5),
we obtain the anticommutation relation (3.24). The relations (3.25) can be
derived by the same procedure.

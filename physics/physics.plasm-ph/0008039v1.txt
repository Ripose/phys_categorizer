Abstract

The electric and magnetic self-ﬁelds can exist in the rotating plasma.
The self-sustained rotation can be established in the plasma. The disturbed
distribution function of rotating plasma is derived from the Vlasov equation.
The propagation of waves in rotating plasma diﬀers from that in the usual
plasma. New terms of the Landau damping appear. The local rotational
behaviour may become prevailing.

INTRODUCTION

Phenomena dealt with are not too rare. However, the causes of the phenomena
(forces, ﬁelds) are rather weak and can often be supposed to be negligible.

It is well known that many astronomical and laboratory objects represent
rotating plasma. Therefore, the study of rotating plasma is of great theoretical
and practical interest.

It is assumed that plasma is neutral on the average. However, electric and
magnetic ﬁelds can exist in plasma, because there are forces which oppose the
electric one1,2.

It is well known that in a wide variety of plasma devices plasma travels
across the magnetic ﬁeld at rates much higher than those explained by collisional
processes. It has been assumed that the electron transport across the magnetic
ﬁeld arises from the ~E × ~B drift ( ~E × ~B instability3).
terms4.

The radial electric ﬁeld exists to balance out the ~v × ~B and centrifugal force
The plane sheet stability of a surface charge has been considered for externally
applied and mutually perpendicular ﬁelds ( ~E ⊥ ~B) which produce an equilibrium
particle ﬂow in the sheet5. The calculation was extended to a cylindrical shell in
the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld6 (the size of a shell is identical to the particle
gyro-orbit).

The equilibrium properties induce a self-electric ﬁeld for a charge slab or a

cylinder (the ﬂuid approximation7,8).

The eﬀect of equilibrium radial electric ﬁeld on the trapped - particle stability
has been investigated 9. The stabilization can result from the conﬁguration

1

in which the radial potential assumes a hollow proﬁle (the equilibrium radial
electric ﬁeld points inward). The theory also predicts the possibility of additional
instability, when the ~E × ~B rotation is present (the rotationally driven trapped
- particle mode).
The development of a radial electric ﬁeld Eρ due to toroidal rotation has
been studied for the toroidal geometry 10. The ion distribution function becomes
Maxwellian with temperature uniform on the magnetic surface. The poloidal ﬂow
decays. The density is distributed over magnetic ﬂux surfaces by the Boltzmann
factor with the eﬀective potential energy that is the sum of a centrifugal potential
and an electrostatic potential required for charge neutrality. The usual small
gyroradius expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation was carried out, and it was
shown, that the eﬀects of centrifugal and Coriolis forces on the particle motion
aﬀect the transport.

The rotational equilibrium in cylindrical, non-neutral plasma with an axial

magnetic ﬁeld has been analysed in detail 11.

The poloidal rotation of plasma due to the ~E × ~B drift has been studied in
tokamaks (the so-called H − mode of improved conﬁnement) with a radial elec-
tric ﬁeld and strong axial magnetic ﬁeld. The ~E × ~B drift rotates the plasma
poloidally (when the radial electric ﬁeld exists).
In non-H-mode plasmas the
poloidal rotation frequency is typically much less than the toroidal rotation fre-
quency in tokamaks. The toroidal geometry of tokamaks becomes important in
some theories of poloidal spin-up12. The poloidal rotation instability (resulting
from the poloidally asymmetric diﬀusion) leads to poloidal velocity shears which
may quell the microturbulence. The nonlinear interplay between the poloidal
spin-up and turbulence-driven anomalous transport leads to bifurcated equilib-
ria (the L to H transition mode in tokamaks). The tokamaks can spontaneously
develop a poloidal velocity shear (the ”P-S” ﬂows). The spin-up persists even
under conditions where the growth rate is sonic 13.

The rotation is well known to induce new poles in the perturbed distribution
function. The so-called resonant diochotron instability 14,15 involves the Landau
damping at the resonant frequency ω = IΩ (I is an integer, Ω is the rotation
frequency). The role of Landau damping in cross-ﬁeld electron beams and in an
inviscid shear ﬂow has been considered for the cylindrical geometry (perturba-
tions with kz = 0) with unperturbed angular velocity ω0(r) = 1
2 n0, 0 ≤ r < b
and ω0(r) = 1
2 n0(b/r)2, b < r ≤ a (n0 is a constant). A formal analysis of the
resonance has been given in the Laplace transforms context 14. The case of a
perfectly conducting wall (at the impedance Z(ω) = 0) was studied, and a slight
shift in the eigenfrequencies from their locations for an induced Z(ω) 6= 0 was
found. The Landau damping can overcome the resistive destabilization (if there
exist gradients in the electron density) for a strictly decreasing electron density
in a cylindrical system, so that only one resistively unstable normal mode can
exist - the fundamental one.

The diochotron instability of a thin ( r2−r1

r1 ≪ 1), tenuous (ωp ≪ ωBe), cylin-

2

drical layer (a single-component plasma) has been investigated in a strong uni-
form constant magnetic ﬁeld using the Vlasov equation 15. The particle gyro-
radius was of the order of the mean radius of a layer. The theoretical model does
resemble the geometry of some experiments which rely on the high energy parti-
cles injection. Two distribution functions were considered, which give the same
density (ρ(r) ∼ [Θ(~r − ~r1) − Θ(~r − ~r2)], where Θ is the Heaviside step function),
but are diﬀerent in the velocity space (the velocity spread is zero, or the parti-
cles oscillate around the mean radius). The self-electric ﬁeld of the equilibrium
density (which is strictly radial) was included in the treatment (but not the self-
magnetic ﬁeld). The stability against electrostatic perturbations with frequency
(where l is the asimuthal wave number of perturbations) and
around −lωBe
the inﬁnite wavelength in the z-direction has been investigated. The perturbed
distribution function was found, and the macroscopic sheared ﬂow was shown to
be not a relevant criterion for instability by itself.

The gyrokinetic integral equations, used for studying the ion temperature
gradient (ITG)- driven mode in a toroidal geometry at low plasma pressure,
have been extended to include the equilibrium ion sheared ﬂows 16. The parallel
and perpendicular sheared ﬂows are destabilizing and stabilizing mechanisms,
respectively. The gyrokinetic integral code was used to explore the sheared ﬂows’
eﬀects on the ITG mode in a sheared slab geometry 17. The mode structure and
eigenfrequencies predicted by the integral code diﬀer from the results derived by
the diﬀerential approach (for higher radial eigenmodes).

The further development of the above mentioned works and some new ideas

are presented in this work. The purposes of the paper are:
1) to show the separation of charges and to obtain rigorous expressions for electric
and magnetic self-ﬁelds in rotating plasma;
2) to demonstrate the self-sustained rotation origin;
3) to derive the perturbed distribution function and to ﬁnd the location of poles
(the terms in the Landau damping);
4) to propose the local-rotational description of plasma.

The consideration is self-consistent in its character (from the ﬁrst principles)
and leans upon the microscopic properties of a matter, rather than upon the con-
tinuous medium (ﬂuid) models. The description can be applied to free rotating
plasma objects (astronomical, for example) with some arbitrary shape and com-
position, to plasma devices with cylindrical symmetry in particular (the arbitrary
geometry is included as the limits of integration only).

The peculiarities, which diﬀerentiate this work from the cited papers, are as

follows:
- Not only the radial electric self-ﬁeld Eρ(ρ, z), but the magnetic self-ﬁeld Bz(ρ, z)
and smaller self-ﬁelds Ez(ρ, z) and Bρ(ρ, z) are taken into consideration (note that
all these components are functions not only of ρ but of z as well). This consid-
eration is necessary, since the behaviour of particles changes qualitatively: the
solution depends not only on the small ratio v
c , but on arbitrary ratio of character-

3

istic velocities as well. All quantities (density, charge density, local composition,
etc.) are not externally given but can be evaluated in a self-consistent manner.
- The possibility of a steady-state rotation of plasma is shown. The self-sustained
rotation of initially neutral plasma origins in the external magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 as a
consequence of the ~E × ~B drift ( ~E is the self-ﬁeld).
- The perturbed distribution function is found (rigorously) proceeding from the
Vlasov equation. The approach diﬀers in carrying through the extra terms due
to kz, a self-consistent radial centrifugal force, the self-ﬁelds and in allowing the
wave amplitudes to be space-dependent.
- The new poles are shown to exist, and the location of these poles is found (the
new terms in the Landau damping appear). Since the wave propagation in ro-
tating plasma (an accelerated medium) diﬀers from that in ordinary plasma, the
local-rotational description of plasma is supposed to be possible (in the strong
turbulence case, for example).

2 THE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS IN

ROTATING PLASMA

Rotating plasma possesses some peculiarities as compared to rotating objects
which consist of neutral particles. We start with the rigid rotation for a simple
explanation only (the substitutions for an arbitrary rotation are given below).
The existence of the centrifugal force

~F = mΩ2~ρ,

(1)

(where ~Ω is the angular frequency of the system, m is the particle mass, ~ρ is
its distance from the axis of rotation) causes diﬀerent eﬀects on particles of
diﬀerent masses. As a result of these diﬀerent eﬀects, the ρ-dependence of particle
concentration is bound to be diﬀerent for particles of diﬀerent masses.

According to the Boltzmann distribution,

kT !,
nα = n0α exp −Uα

(2)

where T is the system temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, n0α is the
particle concentration on the axis of rotation, Uα is the potential energy of α-
sort particles. In the case of neutral particles

Uα = −

mαΩ2ρ2

The nα(ρ) dependences for hydrogen plasma are shown schematically in Fig.1.
Here R0 is the size of a system (the distance from the axis of rotation); symbol
α is either H (hydrogen) or e (electron).

However, plasma consists of charged particles. Since the particles of diﬀer-
ent masses in plasma have diﬀerent charges, this partial separation of particles
produces a partial separation of charges. The negatively charged region is bound
to lie near the axis of rotation, whereas the positively charged region lies near
the system boundary (R0). The electric ﬁeld ~E0(ρ, z) (in the polar coordinate
system: the ~Ω direction is the z direction) exists as a result of charge separation.
This ﬁeld opposes the considerable separation of charges.

As illustrated in Fig.1, there is some distance from the axis of rotation R′

1(z),
1(z) the plasma is negatively

where the local charge equals zero. For 0 ≤ ρ < R′
charged on the average; for R′

1(z) < ρ ≤ R0 the plasma is positively charged.

The partial separation of charges gives rise to the ρ-dependence of charge
density; that is, the plasma possessing the given charge density moves round a
circle of deﬁnite radius. Therefore, circulating currents are inside the rotating
plasma despite the fact, that all particles revolve with ~Ω on the average (~Ω has a
distinct direction). For 0 < ρ < R′
1 the current is opposite to the plasma rotation
direction (since the charge is negative), whereas for R′
1 < ρ ≤ R0 the current
ﬂows in the direction of rotation (since the charge is positive). In the general case
the magnetic actions of currents are not compensated, and the magnetic ﬁeld ~B
exists. This is the magnetic ﬁeld of a solenoid, whose axis coincides with the axis
of system rotation.

For rotating, fully ionized plasma (near macroscopic equilibrium), which con-
sists of elements with atomic number Ni, it follows in polar coordinates ρ, ϕ, z (z

3 SOME APPROXIMATION OF THE DIELEC-

TRIC CONSTANT TENSOR

Now we obtain information about the electron part of the dielectric constant
tensor εαβ (the ion part can be found in a similar manner). The polarization
vector ~P is deﬁned as

∂ ~P
∂t

= ~j ,

~P = ~P0 + ~P ′ exp [i(~k~r − ωt)].

It follows that

P ′

α =

εαβ − δαβ

4π

E,

β ,

(12)

where −iω ~P ′ = −eKe~v, δαβ is the Kroneker symbol. The expression for εαβ in
a rotating system can be derived directly from the equations of electron motion
(the ﬁeld ~E contains the wave ﬁeld ~E ′ ∼ e−iωt) with the force (exact)

We suppose that the constant ﬁeld ~B contains all components (B0ρ, B0ϕ, B0z)
and ~v ∼ e−iωt, i.e. space variations of ~E ′ are neglected. Resolving the equation

7

~v = i ~Fe/(mω) in terms of vρ, vϕ, vz and extracting the ~E ′-dependence only (the
constant polarization ~P0 and the constant part ε(0)

αβ exist), one obtains

εαα = 1 −

approach requires the following conditions:
Be ≪ 1 , (the smallness of space ~E ′-variations in
vT | kα | /ω ≪ 1 ,
the localization region of an electron), i.e. ω must be large enough; and, besides,
ω must not be near the frequency ω1. It follows from the expressions (14), (15),
that the dissipation equals zero:

(the tensor εαβ is Hermitian). The εαβ values determine the wave polarization
(which is elliptic in the general case) for large ω. The gyration vector ~G can
be found from the equation Dα = εαβEβ + i[ ~E × ~G]α , here i = √−1. In this

approximation the components Gα are:

Gα =

,

here α = ρ, ϕ, z.

We note in the general case, that the space dependences of ﬁelds ~E, ~B and
the wave amplitude need to be taken into consideration, in principle (to obtain
rigorous expressions for εαβ or damping of waves, for example). One may sup-
pose, that, as a consequence of space nonhomogeneity of all characteristics, the
rotating plasma system as a whole can be more stable with respect to exter-
nal disturbances (the system goes from resonance inﬂuences). To impart some
energy, the spectrum needs to be rather wide-range.

4 THE LOCATION OF POLES

Since the rotating plasma is a nonhomogeneous accelerated medium, the wave
propagation has some peculiarities (damping, non-rectilinearness).
In the
general case the resonance conditions possess a relatively complex structure

8

ψ(ρ, ϕ, z, ~B, ~E, ~v) = 0. The derivation of the resonance conditions will be demon-
strated below in the context of the linear kinetic description for some special
cases. Note, that the elementary approach to the problem can be developed
from the analysis of the exact force (13):
it is necessary to ﬁnd such particles

(~v(ρ, ϕ, z, t)), for which the work of the wave ﬁeld A = R ~F~vdt is positive for

some speciﬁc wave (in type, direction, polarization). The value A is

A = Z {−e( ~E~v) + mΩ2ρvρ +

e
c

Ωρ(Bρvz − Bzvρ)}dt.

If the mean work is positive, the Landau damping mechanism takes place. In the
kinetic description we start from the system of self-consistent ﬁeld equations:

∂fα
∂t

q = eZ (Nifi − fe)d3p , ~j = eZ (Nifi − fe)~vd3p,

and separate the disturbed terms (caused by the wave propagation):

fα = f0α + δfα ,

~B = ~B0 + ~B ′ , ~E = ~E0 + ~E ′ ,

where α means either e or i. It is believed that

δfα, ~E ′, ~B ′ ∼ A(ρ, z) exp i(~k~r − ωt).

(16)

+ Ue,

(19)

(20)

where Ke is the total number of electrons in the volume V , D is the normalization
constant, Ue is taken from (4). The expression (19) is a solution of the kinetic
equation (16) with the force (13). Ue is the potential part of electron energy
(related with the force ~F ). Note that the nonconservative force e~v × ~B is not
appeared in the potential at all. All terms with ~B include the factor Ω and exist
as a result of the system rotation only. We use the substitutions

~E0 = E0ρ(ρ, z)~eρ + E0z(ρ, z)~ez,

9

and

~k′ = ~k + S(~r)~r, where

S(~r) = −

i

r2 ~r

(21)

Now we make some remarks.

1) The accounting of the amplitude space-dependence is equivalent to including
some imaginary part in ω: ω → ω + iω′. For, the value ω′ is greater than zero
in the case of wave damping, and it follows from (18), (21), that the appropriate
wave amplitude A(ρ, z) is decreasing; the unstable case ω′ < 0 is analogous to
wave amplitude increasing (see (18),(21)). The collisional damping can also be
included in the term (21). The reverse problem can be formulated: with the
A(ρ, z) dependence known (using a probe wave), one should obtain information
about collisional processes (the integral of collisions). However, it is not our
intention to follow this way.
2) In the general case of unsteady rotation and gravitational force existence the
following substitutions need to be done:

The derivation of the disturbed distribution function is demonstrated in Ap-
pendix.

Of main interest here are the poles of δfe (they contribute to the Landau
damping). As a consequence of diﬀerent regimes of particles behaviour (see
Appendix), the resonance conditions diﬀer depending on the particles velocity.
For a < 1 the term Q(ϕ − τ ) does not have any pole in an explicit form (see
(A8) in Appendix). The imaginary part of the dielectric constant tensor arises
from the imaginary part of δfM and from the integration of the exponent 18. We
consider the case | a |≪ 1, i.e. v⊥ is large enough:
ω(ρ)

ω(z)
Be

Ω2
1ρ
ω(z)
Be

v⊥ ≫

v⊥ ≫

,

.

All terms (see (A8) in Appendix) can be expanded as a power series in a. Inte-
grating over the region τ → 0 (which is most considerable for small | a |), one

10

obtains

δfe = Q(ϕ)R ∞

0 exp{−iτ Y1}dτ , where
A1

Y1 =

1 + sin ϕ + cos ϕ

+ A1a cos(ϕ + ϕ0) + d1 + 2D − (d1 + D)a sin(ϕ + ϕ0) ,
i.e. δfe = −iQ(ϕ)/Y1 . To ﬁnd the location of poles, it is assumed, that S = 0;
as a result, we have the resonance conditions:

kzvz − ω − v⊥k⊥ sin(ϕ + ϕ0 + ϕ3 + α)

ω(z)
Be

=

k⊥v2

⊥{sin(ϕ3 + α) − 2 cos(ϕ3 + α)[1 + cos ϕ + sin ϕ]}

.

(22)

(1 + cos ϕ + sin ϕ)qΩ4

1ρ2 + v2

z (ω(ρ)

Be )2

Thus, the space-dependence of physical quantities leads to considerable change
in the resonance conditions, except k⊥ = 0 (for which the well known result
follows: kzvz − ω = 0). Note, that the resonance conditions depend on the space
variable ρ and angle α. Besides, the conditions (22) are nonlinear with respect
to v⊥, ϕ, vz, i.e.
in the general case two of these variables cannot be chosen
arbitrarily. Therefore, the resonance region decreases.

In spite of the existence of poles in explicit form for | a |= 1 and b2 = 1, the
latter conditions are additional; therefore, the resonances don’t contribute to the
Landau damping after integration in (A9) (see Appendix).

Now we consider the case | a |> 1. One can easily see from the structure of

term Q(ϕ − τ ), that there are the poles of the integrand at a > 1 for

ϕ − τ + ϕ0 = arcsin(−

1
a

).

(23)

However, for the additional Landau damping the oscillations of the exponent in
(A8) (see Appendix) near these poles should be studied. For a > 1 the oscillations
do not increase for ϕ + ϕ0 = − arcsin(1/a) and τ = 2nπ, n = 0, 1, 2, .... However,
expanding Y (ϕ, τ ) in τ near τ = 2nπ for n = 1, 2, ..., one can see that the
integration in the limits from −∞ to +∞ in (A8) gives zero. It follows for n = 0,
that δfe = Q(ϕ)R ∞

1 + sin ϕ + cos ϕ

√a2 − 1(sin(ϕ + ϕ0) + sin ϕ1)
Therefore, δfe = −iQ(ϕ)/Y2. The third term in Y2 is negligible near ϕ + ϕ0 =
− arcsin(1/a); the ﬁrst term is also negligible, except ϕ = π, 3π/2. We suppose
S = 0 and, using the deﬁnition of ϕ1, obtain the resonance conditions:

+ D−

(d1 + D) cos ϕ1

0 exp{−iτ Y2}dτ , where
A1a cos(ϕ + ϕ0)
1 + a sin(ϕ + ϕ0)

+

Y2 =

A1

.

kzvz + k⊥v⊥ sin(ϕ3 + α + ϕ1) − ω = 0.

Since ϕ is ﬁxed, the resonance doesn’t contribute to the Landau damping. The
expression for Y2 can be used for ﬁnding approximate location of poles in the

11

case of | a |≫ 1. The latter resonance gives the Landau damping. The resonance
conditions are:

k⊥v⊥ sin(α + ϕ3) sin(ϕ + ϕ0)

. (24)

1 + cos ϕ + sin ϕ

kzvz + k⊥v⊥ sin(ϕ3 + α − ϕ − ϕ0) − ω = −
We can see the transformation of the resonance conditions, which is a consequence
of plasma motion and inhomogeneity. Note, that (24) gives rise to the well known
condition kzvz−ω = 0 for k⊥ = 0. Thus, in the general case there exist resonance
particles (poles in δfe), which contribute to the Landau damping.
We make some remarks on the local-rotational description of plasma. One
can imagine that in a variety of cases the same system is composed of diﬀerent
subsystems. The question of the scale of averaging is not trivial. Since plasma
characteristics depend on the regime in it, it is clear that the averaging over
diﬀerent local subsystems can lead to diﬀerent results. Here the question arises,
what particular averaging is correct? It is possible that this case just represents
the local-rotational regime (since there is additional damping as waves propa-
gate in an accelerated medium). The basic ideas of the description consist in
the following. Instead of using averaged plasma characteristics for ﬁnding some
physical quantity, we shall seek the quantity in a small rotating subsystem with
deﬁnite parameters (any plasma particles are involved in the local rotational
movements). The net result (the speciﬁc physical quantity under investigation
in a plasma system as a whole) can be obtained by averaging the quantity over
all possible directions of subsystem rotation. Actually, we can imagine that the
plasma (even though it is collisionless) consists of rotating parts with radius
r ∼ rD and linear velocity v ∼ vm, where rD is the Debye radius

rD

= s 4πe2

T Xα

KαN 2

α ,

vm is the most probable velocity

vm = s 2T

m

.

Therefore, the characteristic frequency of the local rotation is

(25)

(26)

Ωl ∼

vm
rD
(collisions produce local rotations with r ≤ l0
2 , where l0 is the free path length).
In the general case the solution (but not equations) for a physical quantity
under study (transport coeﬃcients, for example) should be averaged over the
sequence of local rotating ”cells”. For a ”cell” the kinetic equation takes the
form (for electrons):

(27)

(28)

This way of inclusion of local regimes (with subsequent averaging over all

directions of ~Ωl) can be adaptable to the strong turbulence.

5 THE SELF-SUSTAINED ROTATION

First of all, we note that any rotation induces some additional electric ﬁeld ~E0,
which is directed towards the axis of rotation (z-axis). Assume that the initially
non-rotating plasma system resides in the external magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 = ~ezB0.
1) If the electron surplus exists (∆ > 0), then the radial ﬁeld ~E0ρ is directed to
the z-axis. The ~Eoρ × ~B drift of charged particles results in the movement round
a circle. The originated centrifugal force causes partial separation of charges.
Therefore, the ﬁeld | ~E0ρ | will increase resulting in sustaining of rotation. Thus,
a collective rotation with ~Ω directed as ~B (parallel) arises spontaneously in a
plasma system with an electron surplus.
2) If the ion surplus exists (i.e. ∆ < 0), then the radial ﬁeld ~E0ρ is directed
from the z axis. The ~E0ρ × ~B drift initiates rotation with ~Ω being antiparallel to
~B. However, the partial separation of charges, which is caused by a centrifugal
force, results in decreasing | E0ρ |. This eﬀect counteracts the rotation. Since
there exists the rotation with ~Ω antiparallel to ~B in a positive (only) particle
system (it is some limit), there exists some critical value of the ion surplus ∆c
(∆ = ∆c < 0), starting from which the spontaneous rotation of plasma (~Ω an-
tiparallel to ~B) is possible.
We shall show that the spontaneous rotation with ~Ω parallel to ~B can arise in
an initially neutral plasma system (∆ = 0). The condition, under which the self-
rotation arises, is ΩR0 < vd; here vd is the drift velocity, i.e. B0ΩR0/c < −E0ρ.
The equality in the condition is possible for Ω = 0 and Ω = Ωself . Which equi-
librium is stable? We note, that the equiprobable rotational small disturbances
(~Ω → 0; or, factually, the ratio of the rotational energy to kT is small) with
~Ω parallel and antiparallel to ~B are not equivalent for the plasma system as a
whole. As a result, plasma will rotate on the average in some deﬁnite direction:
any rotational disturbance produces the radial ﬁeld ~E0ρ directed toward the axis
of rotation, but the appeared ~Eoρ× ~B drift promotes rotational disturbances with
~Ω parallel to ~B only. We have for the other limit (the case of externally initiated
large ~Ω, i.e. MiΩ2ρ2/(2kT ) ≫ 1) the inequality Ωρ0 > vd, since the limitations
on E0ρ always exist for any plasma system: −∞ < Emin
0ρ < ∞.
Therefore, the drift opposes the rotation. Thus, the rotation tends to some equi-
librium Ωself 6= 0 for ∆ = 0.
In the general case, when the rotation (~Ω is parallel to ~B0) arises by any
reason, the separation of charges and electric ﬁeld arise. As a result, the ~E × ~B
drift of charged particles (the movement round a circle) arises. This movement

0ρ ≤ E0ρ ≤ Emax

13

will either add to the initial rotation or subtract from it. Eventually, the stable
rotation is established. From the equation

where the drift velocity is

vd = Ω(ρ, z)ρ,

~vd = −

cE0ρ(ρ, z)~eϕ

B0

it follows, that the stable rotation frequency is

Ωself (ρ, z) = −

cE0ρ(ρ, z)

ρB0

,

(29)

with E0ρ(ρ, z) taken from (6) and | Bz |≪| B0 |.
Under an assumption, that the originated magnetic ﬁeld ~Bz is comparable to
~B0, the following substitution needs to be done in equation (25): B0 → B0 + Bz
with Bz taken from (10). In this case the self-sustained rotation of plasma takes
place.

We make some remarks.

1) Indeed, to evaluate the rotational state stability one can involve the energy
balance. In this case the energy surplus characterizes qualitatively the rate (or
time) of transition. However, a rather complex integral system of equations for
Ωself can be solved numerically (or by a perturbative method) for all speciﬁc
values of plasma system parameters only.
2) Ωself tends to zero for the temperature high enough.
3) If the external magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 is zero, then the self-sustained rotation is
impossible (the velocity ρΩself must be greater than the speed of light).
4) If several quasistable ﬁeld distributions (distinguished by a potential barrier)
can exist, then the existence of several quasistable rotating regimes (with Ωj
self )
is possible.

6 CONCLUSIONS

The generation of electric and magnetic nonhomogeneous self-ﬁelds in rotating
plasma can be explained by various actions of the centrifugal force on dissimilar
particles. There are diﬀerent ρ-distributions of these particles and the partial sep-
aration of charges. Therefore, the electric ﬁeld arises (see (6),(8)). The magnetic
ﬁeld (see (9),(10)) exists as a result of rotation of charged regions (the mag-
netic actions are not compensated). As for relation to the physics topics from
Sec.I, there are new peculiarities regarding the self-consistent description. All
self-ﬁelds Eρ(ρ, z), Ez (ρ, z), Bρ(ρ, z), Bz(ρ, z) are taken into consideration. The
self-sustained rotation (which origins from initially neutral state) exists as a re-
sult of the particles drifts in the electric self-ﬁeld and external magnetic ﬁeld (see

14

(29)). This is a new result. The dielectric constant tensor in rotating plasma
diﬀers from that in non-rotating plasma. As the result of plasma inhomogeneity
and accelerated motion, the resonance conditions change (see (22),(24)). There
are new poles in a disturbed distribution function and, therefore, new terms in
the Landau damping. The local-rotational description (over rotating ”cells”) of
plasma can be useful.

APPENDIX: Derivation of the disturbed

distribution function

The problem is to obtain the disturbed electron distribution function. We
substitute (17-21) and the force (13) into the kinetic equation (16), correct to
the second order (δf, ~E ′, ~B ′ are small). Then it turns out that

Here fM is the Maxwell velocity distribution function. Note from (A8), that
there exist diﬀerent regimes of particle behaviour (they depend on the velocity
of particles). The dielectric constant tensor can be found from

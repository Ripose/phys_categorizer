Two-dimensional PIC-MCC simulations of capacitively
coupled radio-frequency discharge in methane

Abstract

Two–dimensional capacitively coupled radio frequency discharge
in methane is simulated by PIC-MCC method. The results were ob-
tained in pressure range 50-300 mTorr and voltage range 40-180 V for
discharge frequency 13.56 MHz. The electron energy and electron–
methane reaction rates spatial distributions show existence of two
regimes of discharge glow: a) with active sheaths, when electrons
are hot in electrode sheaths and cold in the middle of discharge so
the electron–neutral reactions strongly dominate in sheaths regions;
b) with volume domination, when the electron energy is more uni-
form and the reactions take place in all discharge volume. The second
regime is usually observed for low discharge voltages, and turns to
the ﬁrst one with voltage increasing. Besides, simulation of chemical
reactions in methane plasma was also fulﬁlled to ﬁnd the gas mixture
composition in discharge volume. The results are in agreement with
the known experimental data.

1 Introduction

The radio-frequency (rf) methane plasma, used for producing carbon ﬁlms
in plasma-enhanced chemical deposition (PECVD) reactors, is an object of
interest for investigations. The numerical modelling of capacitively coupled
radio-frequency (ccrf) plasma reactors has a great importance for under-
standing the processes in methane plasma and their inﬂuence on carbon ﬁlm
deposition, which helps for reactor design and improvement of plasma tech-
nologies.

Basic experimental information about CH4 ccrf discharge plasma com-
position was obtained by group of Sugai [1, 2]. The numerical models of
methane plasma have been intensively developed during the recent decade.
The most widely used approach is the ﬂuid plasma model ([3]–[12]). A com-
prehensive overview of their results can be found in [4] and [6]. In most of

these works, the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) is found using
various approaches and then the rate constants of electron-neutral reactions
are evaluated by integration of EEDF with the known energy-dependent cross
section of each reaction.

Another technique, more accurate but demanding much more computa-
tion eﬀorts, is direct particle simulation [13], called particles-in-cells Monte-
Carlo collision method (PIC-MCC). This approach allows to obtain EEDF
and the rates of electron-neutral reaction by direct Monte-Carlo simulations
of particles trajectories. For methane discharge, such simulations in one-
dimensional case were performed in [14] and [15]. In work [14], each type of
chemical species present in plasma was treated by particle simulation method,
but to make calculations eﬃcient, a limited number of species (electrons, ions
and 5 neutrals) was chosen, and the scheme of chemical reactions was simpli-
ﬁed. Besides, the electron-impact vibrational excitation reactions, which af-
fect the electron energy distribution, were not considered. Another approach
is presented in work [15], where the PIC-MCC simulations were proceeded
only for electrons with accounting of 18 electron–neutral reactions, thus pro-
viding the reaction rates, while the kinetics of ions and neutral species (with
total number of 20) was treated using diﬀusion–drift approximation and mass
balance.

Since pioneering work of Levitskii [16] the diﬀerent modes of ccrf dis-
charge operation were studied intensively in the experiments ([17]–[20]) and
numerically ([21]–[23]). Godyak [17] have studied experimentally the transi-
tion between the low voltage and high voltage modes in argon and helium. In
kinetic simulations [21] and applying a two–electron–group ﬂuid model [22]
the α − γ transition in a rf discharge was studied in helium. Another type of
heating–mode transition was found in the experiment in a low pressure argon
discharge [18]. An increase of the electron temperature in the midplane with
pressure growth was associated in [18] with a change of mechanism of elec-
tron heating, involving the Ramsauer eﬀect. In the ccrf discharge in silane
the transition between diﬀerent modes was studied experimentally [19, 20]
and numerically [23]. The rise of the α − Si : H deposition rate in the
volume dominated mode was detected in the experiment [19, 20]. In work
[24] the transition between diﬀerent modes of ccrf discharge in methane was
studied in one–dimensional simulations with using the combined PIC–MCC
algorithm. The phase diagram of mode location was constructed for wide
range of gas pressures and discharge currents. The hysteresis was found in
the ccrf discharge behavior with current variation.

In this work, we present a two-dimensional (2D) PIC-MCC simulation of
ccrf methane discharge in an axisymmetrical reactor, performing the PIC-
MCC approach for both electron and ion kinetics. One of the points of
interest was the existence of diﬀerent regimes in 2D simulations. Besides, the
gas phase chemistry in discharge plasma was also simulated and compared
with experiment.

Simulation algorithm

The developed PIC-MCC approach is two-dimensional in space and three-
dimensional for particles motion (2D3V). In Monte-Carlo collisions simula-
tions of electron kinetics, besides the elastic scattering, six electron-methane
reactions were considered (listed in table 1), with the same cross sections
as in [11] and [15]. Electron–electron Coulomb scattering, secondary elec-
tron emission and wall reﬂection were neglected so all particles reaching the
chamber walls were eliminated.

In ion kinetics, for simplicity, only one type of ion CH+

5 was considered,

3

4 , CH+

5 , CH+

which is dominant in methane plasma [1] and other main types of ions present
in methane (C2H+
3 ) have a similar form of density proﬁles (shown,
for example, by simulations in [11]), so it is possible to represent the total
amount of ions by one type only. Methane discharge plasma can be treated as
electropositive [9], so negative ions were not taken into account. For positive
ion, the transport cross sections were taken to match the experimental results
of ion mobility in methane [25, 26]. Ion–ion and ion–electron collisions were
not considered.

The time of free ﬂight in MCC simulations is treated by null collisions
method. The equations of motion were solved by explicit scheme, the time
step was chosen 10−11 s for electrons and 40 times larger for ions. The number
of simulated particles usually was 100000 for both electrons and ions. The
space charge density, used for solving Poisson equation, is approximated using
particles–in–cells technique.

The self-bias voltage was adjusted to keep time-averaged current equal
to zero and its value was imposed on the grounded electrode. Potential on
powered electrode was set equal to applied rf voltage. The Poisson equa-
tion was solved on two-dimensional cylindrical grid with 150-200 nodes in
discharge axis direction and 50-80 nodes in radial direction, condensing near
outer electrode edge.

The main assumption of discharge model is that the kinetics of charged
particles was simulated in pure methane. As the characteristic time of re-
laxation of gas mixture composition is of 105-107 rf cycles, for the complete
PIC-MCC discharge simulation including plasma chemistry dynamics a spe-
cial algorithms devoted to this problem should be developed, which is the
subject of further work. The calculations of plasma chemical composition
using electron-methane reaction rates obtained in discharge simulations are
presented in Section IV. It was shown, for methane pumping through the
reactor chamber at such rates that time of gas residence in discharge volume
τ is of 0.1 sec by order of magnitude, the most abundant chemical species
usually have densities 103 times less than methane (see below), so we expect
the kinetics should not change critically. Also the abundance of excited state
of methane is neglected, which is a common assumption [14, 15].

The axisymmetrical physical domain for plasma simulation is shown in
ﬁgure 1. The chosen dimensions of reactor refer to the experimental setup
[1]. The gas-phase chemistry simulation domain is also shown.

simulation.

To accelerate the convergence of PIC-MCC simulation, the algorithm
described in [27] was applied. The advantage of this method is illustrated in
ﬁgure 2, where total number of ions in discharge volume during simulation
is plotted versus number of simulated rf periods for two diﬀerent values of
acceleration factor KA (explained in [27]). The simulations were proceded
for geometry shown in ﬁgure 1, pressure 50 mTorr and Urf =80 V. It can be
seen, that the convergence of simulation results is by nearly KA times faster,

5

thus saving the computational amount by the same factor. In practice, KA
factor is limited (usually to 5-7) because it strongly increases the statistical
noise and oscillations of solution. Convergence usually required 500-3000 rf
cycles, the larger value belongs to higher voltages and pressures. Simulation
of 1000 rf cycles took about 40-60 hours on Pentium III 800 MHz.

3 Results of discharge simulations

Simulations were performed for discharge frequency 13.56 MHz in a cylindri-
cal reactor with 14 cm diameter and 6 cm interelectrode spacing (ﬁgure 1)
in pressure P range from 50 to 300 mTorr and rf voltage Urf from 40 to 180
V.

The main information obtained was 2D distribution of plasma density
and potential, mean electron energy and electron - methane reactions rates.
Previous 1D simulations of rf methane plasma [15, 24] show that for some dis-
charge parameters in the center of discharge gap, where electrons are trapped
by the ambipolar electric ﬁeld, accumulation of relatively cold electrons oc-
curs. Hence the average electron energy in this region is much smaller than
in electrode sheaths. In noble gases, this eﬀect was also observed [28, 29].
In 1D simulations, electron energy in the sheaths may be several eV, and
in center of discharge it may be one order of magnitude less. Hence, the
electron - methane reactions strongly dominate in the sheaths region. We
call this ”active-sheaths” (AS) discharge regime, in contrast to the another
observed ”volume-dominated” (VD) regime, when electron energy has more
uniform proﬁle and electron - neutral reactions proceed in all reactor volume
[24].

We observed the existence of these regimes also in 2D simulations and
studied the transition between them for diﬀerent discharge parameters. As
an example, results of simulation for P=123 mTorr and Urf = 120 V are
presented in ﬁgure 3. The electron density, averaged over period (ﬁgure
3(a,d)), is asymmetrical with maximum shifted to powered electrode due to
self–bias voltage (this was also observed in experiment [1] and predicted by
1D PIC-MCC simulation with artiﬁcial bias imposing in [14]). It is seen that
electrons in the center of discharge gap are relatively cold (average energy
is 0.75 eV while in sheaths it exceeds 2 eV), see ﬁgure 3(b) and also solid
line in ﬁgure 3(e). This explains the behaviour of electrons reaction rates,
which has steep maxima in regions with hot electrons. In ﬁgure 3(c) the 2D

6

distributon of dissociation reaction rate CH4 +e → CH3+H+e is shown. It is
chosen for illustration as the main methane dissociation channel; the proﬁles
of other dissociation and ionization rates have a similar form. It is seen, that
the reaction proceeds in sheath regions and also at the outer reactor edge,
and is suppressed (the rate falls by 2 orders of magnitude) in the most of
discharge volume (see ﬁgure 3(c)). On the axial proﬁle (solid curve in ﬁgure
3(f)), the absolute maximum of rate is located where maximum of electron
energy coincides with large electron density; a second small maximum of rate
corresponds to second maximum of energy but with lower plasma density.
For 2D case, the diﬀerence of electron energy in center and in sheaths is not
so large as in 1D simulations [15, 24], where it reaches one order of magni-
tude. This may be explained by inﬂuence of reactor edge region, where cold
electrons are not trapped by electric ﬁeld so strongly as in the 1D discharge
geometry, and hence they may diﬀuse in radial direction, which leads to more
ﬂat spatial proﬁle of electron energy.

The described above case is an example of AS regime. Another discharge
regime is shown in ﬁgure 4, obtained by simulation at P=50 mTorr and
Urf =60 V. Here we see a smooth proﬁle of electron energy (ﬁgures 4(b) and
4(e)) and the reaction rate follows the electron density (see ﬁgure 4(c),4(f)).
This corresponds to VD regime of discharge.

In general, for 2D simulations the discharge properties are radially uni-
form in the inner reactor area only (up to half of reactor radius).
In AS
regime, near reactor edge the vertical electron energy proﬁle tends to be
more uniform (dashed curve in ﬁgure 3(e)) and the reaction rate is not such
strongly suppressed in gap center (dashed curve in ﬁgure 3(f)). Note that
the average electron energy near edge is higher than in inner region, and al-
though the plasma density gradually decreases towards the edge, the reaction
rate even increases.

To investigate the transition between two regimes, we performed calcula-
tions with diﬀerent rf voltages Urf for pressures 50, 123 and 300 mTorr. The
results are presented in 1D graphics, showing the period-averaged plasma
parameters plotted along the reactor axis (for r=0).

For the ﬁrst case, P=50 mTorr, the obtained plasma potential, electron
density, mean electron energy and CH4 → CH3+H dissociation rate proﬁles
are shown in ﬁgure 5(a-d) for several applied Urf . It is seen in ﬁgure 5(a) that
the potential drop in electrode sheaths is increasing with Urf , and near the
powered electrode (with zero time-averaged potential) it is few times larger
than near the other one (its potential is equal to bias). The transition from

VD to AS regime is noticeable in electron energy proﬁles. With increasing
voltage, the energy decreases and for Urf over 100 V an area with relatively
cold electrons appears, making a valley on electron energy proﬁle (ﬁgure
5(c)). A relatively large energy maximum appears in the sheath of powered
electrode and a small one in the grounded sheath.
It is interesting, that
increasing of Urf from 120 to 180 V change the energy proﬁle very weak, while
electron density still increase (ﬁgure 5(b)). The form of all density proﬁles is
almost identical, with various scaling only. The maximun is slightly shifted
to powered electrode due to self–bias voltage. The electron reactions rate
proﬁle is wide for low voltages, and narrows with voltage increasing (ﬁgure
5(d)), indicating that the electron reactions tend to localize in the sheath
region. The statistical noise is clearly seen on the rate proﬁles, despite they
are averaged over 100 recent rf cycles. To make picture readable, in ﬁgure
5(d) not all rate proﬁles are shown and the curves are plotted normalized to
maximum value of each.

The results for P=123 mTorr are shown in ﬁgure 6. The transition from
VD to AS regime is clearly seen here. For Urf =40 V the central minimum
of electron energy is hardly seen (curve 1 in ﬁgure 6(c)), but the regime
is already transitional to AS, as can be seen from the reaction rate (40 V
curve in ﬁgure 6(d)) - in the sheath near powered electrode it is 2-3 times
larger than in the volume. With Urf increasing, energy minimum becomes
wider and deeper, making narrow maxima in both sheaths. Again the larger
maximum is observed in powered electrode sheath. The second maximum
near grounded electrode is better seen than for 50 mTorr, possibly due to
larger potential drop in this sheath at higher pressure (compare ﬁgures 5(a)
and 6(a)). The form of electron energy proﬁle also tends to saturate for Urf
larger than 150 V, while the form of larger maximum becomes established
near Urf =100 V. Electron density increases with Urf , as shown in ﬁgure 6(b).
For 150 and 180 V it is not shown, but has the identical form as for 120 V,
scaled to maximum 3.7×109 cm−3 and 5.7×109 cm−3 correspondingly. The
position of density maximum shifts to the powered electrode (as observed
in [1], shown by points in ﬁgure 6(b)) and for Urf larger than 80 V does
not move. The dissociation rate (ﬁgure 6(d)) exhibits two maxima near
both sheath regions, with strong rate suppression in central region with Urf
increasing, thus indicating transition to the AS regime. Larger maximum
corresponds to both energy and density maxima near powered electrode, with
Urf increase it strongly enlarges without broadening; the second maximum,
near grounded electrode, is smaller and diminishes with Urf increasing due

to more cool electrons in this sheath. The points in ﬁgures 6(b,c) are taken
from measurements made for P=123 mTorr in [1]. The best ﬁtting with our
simulations is obtained for Urf =80 V, which is in agreement with discharge
power 10 W in experiment [1].

Comparison with simulations of the same discharge parameters using ﬂuid
model [5] show good agreement in plasma potential proﬁle (within a few V)
and electron density (within 20%) but diﬀerent electron energies, which were
in [5] 3-4 eV in plasma bulk and near grounded electrode but increased to
11-13 eV in powered electrode sheath.

The last set of simulations was proceeded for P=300 mTorr (ﬁgure 7).
For Urf =60 V the regime is VD, with symmetrical plasma density proﬁle
and hardly noticeable minimum in energy proﬁle (curve 1 at ﬁgures 7(b) and

12

7(c)) but enhanced reaction rates in sheaths (60 V curve in ﬁgure 7(d)). For
Urf =80 V, the regime is closer to AS (seen from the reaction rate proﬁle, 80
V curve in ﬁgure 7(d)), the plasma density is one order of magnitude larger
than for 60 V and asymmetrical (curve 2 in ﬁgure 7(b)), although the electron
energy proﬁle (curve 2 in ﬁgure 7(c)) does not exhibit a deep minimum.

With further increasing of Urf , narrow energy maxima again appear
in both sheaths, but unlike for the previous pressures, the maximum in
grounded electrode sheath is larger than the other one. Such diﬀerence in
energy proﬁle evolution may possibly be explained by comparing plasma po-
tential behavior (compare ﬁgures 6(a) and 7(a)). For 300 mTorr the potential
drop in powered electrode sheath is by 16-18 V smaller than for 123 mTorr,
while near the grounded one it is larger: for Urf from 80 to 180 V the drop
varies from 30 to 40 V instead of 23 to 28 V for 123 mTorr. Sheath thickness
is nearly the same for both pressures (near 0.9 cm in AS-regime). Like for
previous pressures, the energy proﬁles tends to saturate with voltage over
150 V.

The behaviour of electron density is shown in ﬁgure 7(b). As it varies for
more than two orders of magnitude, the proﬁles are also plotted normalized
to maximal value of each. However, it can be seen from this graphics that
VD-AS transition leads to accumulation of cold electrons in ampibolar ﬁeld
region, where plasma potential has a plateau.

4 Gas phase chemistry simulation

For simulation of gas phase chemistry, the balance equations for neutral
species density ni(r, z) were solved, where r is the distance from the reactor
axis (radial direction), z is the distance from the powered electrode (axial
direction). The physical domain for chemistry simulation is reduced to in-
terelectrode space, as shown in ﬁgure 1. The convection is also taken into
account:

Ri is the sum of generation and loss for i-th species due to chemical
reactions, ~Ji is the ﬂux, where Di is diﬀusivity, ~V is the gas velocity in the

dni
dt

= Ri + div ~Ji,

~Ji = Di ~∇ni + ni ~V ;

Figure 8: Calculated 2D density proﬁles for radicals CH3 (a) and CH2 (b)
obtained for P=123 mTorr, Urf = 80 V, τ =150 ms.

The set of gas phase chemical reactions was taken as in [6] with reactions
responsible for C2H5 radical balance added from [11] (see table 2). The vol-
ume rates of electron - methane reactions are obtained in discharge simulation
as two-dimensional proﬁles and used as production terms for corresponding
species. The account of ion - methane reactions 5 and 6 requires the infor-
mation about ion mixture composition, which is not considered in PIC-MCC
simulations. However, preliminary calculations show that a simpliﬁcation
can be made to exclude the ion reactions from the chemical model. Since the
rate constant of reactions 5 and 6 are high enough, estimation shows that
CH+
3 ions exist for a few free paths only before conversion to CH+
5
and C2H+
5 , which do not take part in gas phase chemistry. As each type of
ion has the only one way of chemical conversion, the volume rate of reaction
5 can be assumed equal to those of 3. The same applies to reactions 6 and
4. So the reactions 3,5 and 4,6 may be combined and replaced by:

4 and CH+

2CH4 + e = CH+
2CH4 + e = C2H+

3,5:
4,6:
with the rates equal for those of reactions 3 and 4, respectively. Thus the
eﬀect of ion - methane reactions is accounted through their production rates

and only neutral species remain in the chemical reactions system.

The rate constant of reaction 10, found in literature, ranged from k10=
10−20 [1] to 10−18 [6, 9] and 1.7×10−17 m3s−1 [3]. This rate constant strongly
aﬀects the solution for CH2 radical, because CH4 has the largest density and
reaction 10 is the main loss term for CH2. For the other species its inﬂuence
is weak. We used it as a ﬁtting parameter, and found that the best agreement
with experiment [2] is achieved for k10= 1.5×10−18 m3s−1, which is close to
used in [6] or [9].

To take into account the eﬀect of convection, we considered reactor with
gas inlet through the centre of reactor and outpumping at the outer boundary.
For these model calculations the ﬁeld of gas velocity ~V (r, z) was simpliﬁed:

Vz(r, z) = 0

Vr(r, z) = V0r0/r, r > r0 ; V0r/r0, r < r0

where r0 is the gas inlet radius (taken as 0.5 cm). Density of CH4 was
held constant at r < r0 in order to make a feed term in convection. The value
of V0 was deﬁned to give a chosen time τ of gas residence in reactor, which
was varied in calculations from τ = 15 ms to 300 ms. Although assuming
Vz to zero may be a rough approximation, especially for the central region,
calculations show that the density proﬁles are not very sensitive to details of
~V ﬁeld in central region, but depend mostly on τ .

The balance equations are approximated using ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme in
cylindrical physical domain (see ﬁgure 1) and integrated on time by Runge-
Kutta method until the solution converged to steady state. The densities
of radicals converge fast, while solution for stables requires physical time of
about 2τ .

A typical result of two-dimensional gas phase chemistry simulation is
presented in ﬁgures 8 and 9. The electron - methane reaction rates were
taken for discharge at P=123 mTorr, Urf = 80 V, τ was chosen as 150 ms.

Figure 8 show two-dimensional density proﬁles of the main radicals CH3
and CH2. As the discharge regime is close to AS, the density has maxima
near electrode sheaths, where electron-methane reactions are localized (see
ﬁgure 6(d)). Proﬁle of CH3 is more ﬂat due to its larger time of chemical
decay.

Figure 9(a) show the proﬁles ni(r) in radial direction, plotted by solid
lines for radicals, which proﬁles are shown at z=1.2 cm, where radical density
is maximal, and by dotted lines for stable species (their proﬁles are almost

ﬂat in axial direction). Figure 9(b) shows proﬁles ni(z) of same species in
axial direction at the outer edge of electrodes (r=7 cm), where all densities
are maximal. The proﬁles of CH, which has in our calculations density less
than 107 cm−3, are enlarged by factor of 1000. For τ =150 ms, the most
abundant stable C2H6 has maximal density 103 times less than methane (4.3
× 1015 cm−3), so the neglecting of chemistry inﬂuence on discharge physics
is possible.

Calculations with various τ show, that the density proﬁles of stable
species, which main loss term is convection, are approximately proportional
to τ . For radicals, the proﬁles are determined also by diﬀusion and chemical
decay, so for low gas velocities the inﬂuence of convection is weak. The eﬀect
of τ variation on CH3 density proﬁle is shown in ﬁgure 10. The upper curve
was obtained with zero convection term, when the steady state solution is
achieved only for radicals. Of course our discharge simulation remains valid
only for small enough τ (of 100 ms order of magnitude), while we can still
neglect the change of gas composition, so this curve shows only the possible
limit of convection inﬂuence.

It is seen, that the density saturates with increasing of τ , at ﬁrst in
the outer region, where gas velocity is smaller. For τ >100 ms it becomes

19

saturated for the most part of reactor, so we usually made calculations with
τ =150 ms (for our reactor geometry and P=123 mTorr this corresponds to
gas feed rate of 55 sccm, which is close to used in experiments [1, 2]. The
behaviour of H and C2H5 proﬁles is similar. For CH2 and CH, the proﬁle is
much less sensitive to τ , because the main loss term for them is the chemical
decay.

5 Comparison with experiment

Calculations with various pressure were made to compare the proﬁles of CH3
and CH2 radicals with the observed in [2]. The simulated pressures were
300, 140, and 57 mTorr, the other conditions were the same as for ﬁgure
8. The results are presented in ﬁgure 11(a,b) for CH3 and ﬁgure 11(c,d) for
CH2. Figure 11(a) shows CH3 proﬁles, plotted at r= 4.5 cm, where they
were measured in experiment [2], for pressures 140 and 300 mTorr. The
agreement with experiment for P=140 mTorr is ﬁne. Note that the only
ﬁtting parameter was the rate constant k10. For P=300 mTorr the proﬁle
exhibits two maxima, similar to experiment, but the calculated density is
some larger, especially near the grounded electrode. Figure 11(c) shows the
same for CH2. The agreement for 140 mTorr is good again, but proﬁles are
more steep than in experiment, especially for 300 mTorr, where calculated
density is very small in the centre of discharge gap. This may be caused
by underestimation of the electron–methane reaction rates in the discharge
center for high pressures. This shows that for pressures of 300 mTorr and
higher the developed kinetic model is not very accurate.
In ﬁgures 11(b)
and 11(d) the both radical proﬁles are shown for 57 mTorr. Although the
calculated proﬁles are more steep than the observed, the agreement can be
considered as satisfactory.

We can say the calculated proﬁles exhibit the similar behaviour as the
observed in experiment. The shape of described in [2] density humps and
transition to ﬂat proﬁles with pressure decreasing are simulated well. We
suppose that the appearance of density humps indicate the transition from
VD to AS regimes, which is consistent with our simulations. The quantitative
agreement is good in pressure range from 50 to 150 mTorr for both radicals,
especially for CH3. Also for CH3 it is within 30% in range 50÷300 mTorr.
As for CH2, the calculated densities in plasma bulk are underestimated for
pressures larger than 150 mTorr.

6 Summary

Accelerated PIC-MCC method was applied to two-dimensional simulation
of capacitively coupled radio frequency discharge in methane. The obtained
spatial distributions of mean electron energy and electron–methane reaction
rates show existence of two regimes of discharge glow. The ﬁrst, with active
sheaths, is characterized by hot electrons localized in electrode sheaths and
relatively cold electrons in other discharge volume, hence the reactions pro-
ceed in electrode sheaths regions and are suppressed in the plasma bulk. For
the case of the second one, with volume domination, the electron energy is
more uniform and the reactions take place in all discharge volume.

The transition between discharge regimes for one–dimensional geometry
was previously studied in [24] using combined PIC–MCC model. Unlike
the 1D results, where the transition occurs abruptly at some critical cur-
rent density, in 2D case transition is gradual, with continuous evolution of
mean electron energy and reaction rates proﬁles. For the considered reactor
geometry it was found, that the VD regime is observed for low rf voltages
(40-60 V), and turns to AS with voltage increasing. The transition proceeds
in Urf range from 60 to 120 V and is noticed ﬁrstly at the spatial proﬁle of
electron–methane reaction rates. For Urf over 120 V the regime is deﬁnitely
AS. It was also noted, that the mean electron energy proﬁle tends to saturate
for Urf over 150 V, and changes very little with further voltage increasing.
For another reactor geometry the quantitative results may diﬀer.

To ﬁnd the gas mixture composition in discharge volume, simulations of
chemical reactions in methane plasma were also performed, with the diﬀusion
and convection ﬂux of species included. The results show good agreement
with the known experimental data, especially for pressure range from 50 to
150 mTorr. For more wide range to 300 mTorr, a qualitative agreement,
namely the behaviour of radical density proﬁles shape, is obtained too.

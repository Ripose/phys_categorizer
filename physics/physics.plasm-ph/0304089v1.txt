Long-range attraction between particles in dusty plasma
and partial surface tension of dusty phase boundary

(Dated: January 11, 2014)

Eﬀective potential of a charged dusty particle moving in homogeneous plasma has a negative part
that provides attraction between similarly charged dusty particles. A depth of this potential well
is great enough to ensure both stability of crystal structure of dusty plasma and sizable value of
surface tension of a boundary surface of dusty region. The latter depends on the orientation of the
surface relative to the counter-ion ﬂow, namely, it is maximal and positive for the surface normal
to the ﬂow and minimal and negative for the surface along the ﬂow. For the most cases of dusty
plasma in a gas discharge, a value of the ﬁrst of them is more than suﬃcient to ensure stability of
lenticular dusty phase void oriented across the counter-ion ﬂow.

INTRODUCTION

A gas–solid phase transition observed in diﬀerent dusty
laboratory plasmas [1–8]. It counts in favor of presence
of strong long-range attraction between similarly charged
dusty particles. By now some physical mechanisms are
proposed to explain formation of a regular arrangement
of micron-sized particles embedded in a gas discharged
plasma. A part of them is based on the account for elec-
trostatic ﬁelds of strata and walls of discharge tubes[9].
In doing, so a generality of solution of the problem of
the eﬀective attractive potential is lost and, in particu-
lar, the situation of dusty plasma crystal in a thermal
dusty plasma of gas burner [5] where there are no walls
and external ﬁelds drops out of such interpretations.

The most promising approach holds that the ion
streaming motion causes an attractive wake potential
behind the dust particles. Originally it was developed
[10, 11] for particular case of supersonic ﬂows which is re-
alized in the sheath of radiofrequency discharges. Later,
it was extended with participation of one of the authors
of Ref.
[10] to the case of subsonic ion ﬂows [12], but
physics of shielding of dust charged particles was sup-
posed to be strongly modiﬁed with mandatory regard to
anisotropy and asymmetry of the ion temperature in the
sheath.

Below is shown that the attraction between simi-
larly charged particles can be resulted from a dynami-
cal screening of the Coulomb potential remaining in the
frame of a single physical mechanism for both supersonic
and subsonic regimes. The distinction of the dynami-
cal screening from the static Debye screening is due to a
motion of particles relative to screening charges (counter-
ions or electrons). From the physical point of view, this
eﬀect can be interpreted as a consequence of loss of spher-
ical symmetry of the Debye screening cloud around the
moving charged particle resulted in a space charge with

∗Electronic address: abas@idg.chph.ras.ru

the opposite sign forming in its wake. Not only do this
space charge compensates the particle’s potential but
may also give rise to a local wake potential of the op-
posite sign. In the supersonic regime the wake potential
oscillates inasmach of Cherenkov wave generation.

This eﬀect is well known in the usual electron-ion
plasma [13–15]. When the charge is moving, the static
Debye screening modiﬁes so that the potential in the
oncoming ﬂow of electrons grows approaching to the
Coulomb potential with an increasing of velocity while
the potential in the outward ﬂow decreases up to alter-
nating of its sign.

Similar eﬀect was found [15, 16] in a system of grav-
itating masses where the static screening is absent and
accounting for the dynamical screening gives rise to an
alternating potential of gravitational interaction.

The aim of the present paper is to propose the most
general model of dynamical screening of ﬁeld of dusty
particle charge to explain the observable interparticle at-
traction. It may be supposed that the distance from the
particle to the attractive minimum of the wake poten-
tial determines a period of the resulted lattice of dusty
particles.

Besides, the interparticle attraction is to give rise to
a surface tension of a dusty phase interface. Really, this
explains a sharp non-diﬀusion character of a particle den-
sity variation observed at the interfaces in the experi-
ments on dusty plasma crystals. The most characteristic
phenomenon of such kind are voids in a homogeneous
dusty plasma. The characteristic lenticular form of the
voids may be explained by strong peculiar dependence of
the surface tension on the surface orientation relative to
the ion ﬂow.

The notion of the surface tension of a dusty phase was
mentioned brieﬂy by Tsitovich [17] but his estimation of
its value was erroneous. Conceivably that might be the
reason why the surface tension was not mentioned in the
subsequent papers by Tsitovich (as a co-author) on the
theory [18, 19] of spherical voids.

The outline of the paper is the following. In Sec. II, the
model for eﬀective non-potential attractive forces of in-

teractions between dust particles will be developed. This
model can explain an appearance of the lattice structure
both in gas discharge dusty plasma and in thermal dusty
plasma of gas burner. In Sec. III, a surface tension of
a boundary of dusty phase is estimated and conditions
of stability of a lenticular void in the dusty plasma are
examined.

The system under consideration consists of negatively
charged dusty particles of the charge Q =
Zpe and
concentration np, and positively charged counter-ions
of the charge e (for deﬁniteness sake we will consider
singly charged ions) and mass m. For simplicity, neutral
molecules of a buﬀer gas are neglected here and dusty
particles are considered as point charges.

−

While forming of the negative charges of dusty parti-
cles the electrons are condensed on particles’ surfaces and
their concentration in plasma decreases suﬃciently. As
a result, in the case of great Zpnp their density becomes
so little that the electron Debye radius of screening of
the ion charge appears to be much greater the ion Debye
radius of screening. Thus, we can restrict our considera-
tion to the simpliﬁed model of one-component ion plasma
in which the negatively charged dusty particles are im-
mersed.

If the negative test point charge Q is moving in the
system of ions and dusty particles with the velocity u it
gives rise to some perturbations of the system state. Due
to great diﬀerence in masses and concentrations of ions
and dusty particles we can restrict our consideration to
a perturbation of the ion component only (just as a per-
turbation of an electron component is taken into account
only, as a rule, in the problem of screening of an ion
charge in the electron-ion plasma). Such perturbation
of ionic subsystem is described by the set of the Vlasov
equation for a distribution function over coordinates and
velocities of ions and Poisson equation for an eﬀective
potential induced by the perturbation of ion density and
moving test charge. Interactions between ions and neu-
tral molecules of the buﬀer gas are neglected here [20].

Such simpliﬁed model

is well studied in the test-
particle approach to the electron-ion plasma theory [13–

It is not diﬃcult to calculate numerically the value of
this integral in an arbitrary range of the parameter M
variations at any point X, Z.

Corresponding results of numerical calculations for
M = 3 are illustrated in Fig.1. It is seen here that there is
well deﬁned negative minimum of the potential along the
axis Z at a distance of order of ﬁve Debye radius, which
has been formed as a result of deformation of screening
Debye cloud in the vicinity of the moving particle.

In gas discharges, where forming of crystal structure
of dusty particles was observed, a diﬀusion ion velocity

strength. To deﬁne the mobility, we are to take into

and recharge eﬀect also. According to [22], the diﬀu-
sion velocity of the complex N e+

in a characteristic for glow-discharge ﬁeld E/p =
1 V cm−1torr−1 and the heat velocity ˜v = 400 m c−1 (at
T = 300 K). Then M = 0.125. For the ion N e+, the dif-
fusion velocity decreases near-threefold as a consequence
0.05. In the case of

to the heat velocity but surpass it [22]. Because of this,

Observed quasi-crystal structure in a thermal plasma,
that is, in the dusty ﬂame of gas burner [5, 8, 23], can
be treated also as a consequence of movement of charged
particles relative to ions of the ﬂame. To obtain quan-
titative estimations of the eﬀect, the additional data on
a gap of velocities of particle and ion ﬂows are neces-
sary. This gap is determined by conditions of injection
of the dusty particles into the ﬂame, and in the steady
state limit it is likely to go to a sedimentation velocity of
charged particles in the rising ﬂow.

The graphs of ϕ(X = 0, Z < 0; M ) for diﬀerent M
in the wake of charged particle are illustrated in Figs.

The values M > 1 correspond to a supersonic move-
ment when Cherenkov radiation of ion-acoustic waves
takes a place that explains an appearance of space os-
cillations of the wake potential. It should be noted that
in the range of values of M from 1 to
3.3 an increasing
of the depth of the ﬁrst minimum takes a place but at fur-
ther gain of M the depth of the ﬁrst minimum decreases
(see Fig.4).

In the incoming ﬂow (Z > 0) the eﬀective potential
varies continuously with a gain of M from the Debye
potential
1/z. This
indicates that the forward part of the Debye screening
cloud is not pressed by the incoming ﬂow to the particle
but blew away from it.

The negative minimum of the wake potential points to
presence of a space charge of the opposite sign. Thus,
the large charged particles moving relative ion subsys-
tem together attendant space charges constitute a sys-
tem of dipoles oriented along the direction of the relative
motion. This gives rise to formation of hierarchies of
particles-dipoles along lines of the ion ﬂow.

Moreover, this interaction between dust particles is

asymmetric in such a way that attractive force is commu-
nicated only downstream the ion ﬂow. This situation was
clearly demonstrated in the experiments [24, 25] where
upper or lower particle was pushed by the laser beam
and it was just lower dust particle that ﬁtted its position
when the upper particle was shifted and not vice versa.
So heavily non-conservative character of the interparti-
cle interactions excludes any possibility to introduce an
eﬀective potential of the interaction.

Besides, as it is seen in Fig.1, the resulted negative po-
tential is long-range in the transverse direction X, also,
that provides an attraction between particles from neigh-
bor hierarchies and, in its turn, causes the particles from
neighbor hierarchies to shift relative one another along
the ion ﬂow for a distance of order of a half dipole length.
Because of this interaction is much weaker then along the
ﬂow, the situations can take place when the lengthwise
attraction appears quite strong for the hierarchies forma-
tion but too weak for transverse ordering [8].

Thus, the movement of the charged particle relative
ion ﬂow gives rise to anisotropic potential ﬁeld in which
an energy of another similar particle of the charge Q is
U (r) = QΦ(r) = Q2κϕ(r). Then, the eﬀective force of

condition is fulﬁlled when M > 0.01.

The long-range attraction between likely charged dusty
particles resting in an equilibrium plasma (M = 0) was
found in [28]. It is possible that this kind of attraction
can give rise to forming of crystal structure but it is ir-
relevant to the observed [1–4] dependence of the lattice
period on the ion ﬂow velocity and forming (at small M )
of hierarchies along the ﬂow non-interacting with which
other.

III. SURFACE TENSION OF DUSTY PHASE

One of characteristic feature of a dispersed phase in
dusty plasma is presence of sharp (non-diﬀusion) bound-
ary surface of a dusty cloud (”dusty drop”). Consider-
able recent attention has been focused on the problem
of formation of voids (”dusty bubbles”) of the dispersed

phase. It is reasonable to suppose that both phenomena
are of the same nature related with presence of a surface
tension resulted from the attractive interaction between
charged particles.

In general, the surface tension coeﬃcient of an inter-
phase boundary is deﬁned as the integral of a diﬀerence
between transverse p⊥ and longwise pk pressures over an
interphase layer of thickness l

where the axis z1 directed along the normal to the layer.
On the molecular level, a pressure can be written in
the form of a virial equation of state and expressed via
a number density n(z1), virial of a force of intermolecu-
lar interaction F(r) and radial correlation function g(r),
where r = r2
r1 is the distance between particles. For
a bulk equilibrium ﬂuid the function g(r) is calculated
as a rule with the use of the Born–Green equation. At
an interphase surface the situation is much more com-
plex; this being so, notably rough approximations are
used here. One of them is Fowler’s step approximation,
when the number density n(z1) is regarded as constant n0
within the liquid phase and zero outside the liquid, and
radial function g(r) within the surface layer is assumed
to be the same as in the bulk liquid. Then the surface
tension coeﬃcient is determined by the Fowler formula

It is implied here that the z-component of the vector r is
normal to the surface. Kirkwood and Buﬀ [31] estimated
the surface tension of liquid argon on the base of this
formula and obtained quite satisfactory value (error
25%).

∼

It is supposed in the Fowler’ formula that the inter-
molecular interaction is spherically symmetric that does
not allow to apply this formula as such to the boundary
of dusty phase.

When applying to the boundary of dusty phase, the
pressures p⊥ and pk are to be considered as partial pres-
sures of dusty component. Then, the surface tension of
dusty phase should be interpreted as partial property too.
To estimate its value some simpliﬁcation will be intro-
duced. Firstly, the radial distribution will be used in the
form of the Boltzmann factor

that is typical for dilute systems. Secondly, when esti-
mating the surface tension, the interactions within hi-
erarchies will be regarded only as it is much stronger
interactions between particles from diﬀerent hierarchies.

The axis z in both equations directed along the normal
to the surface and the forces Fz(r) in the equation for
γ⊥ and Fx(r) in the equation for γk are determined by
interactions along hierarchies.

A numerical estimation of these expressions for np ∼

104 din cm−1. Both of these coeﬃcients
and γk ∼ −
in absolute magnitude surpass suﬃciently the typical
surface tension coeﬃcient of a liquid at normal con-
102 din cm−1 (as an example, for water
ditions γliq ≃

to variations of γ relative to γ⊥ as a consequence of in-

Stability of the lenticular void ensures possibility of its
existence. The problem of its appearance remains to be
solved. It may be suggested that a phase transition of the
ﬁrst kind takes a place in a homogeneous dusty plasma,
and strong anisotropic surface tension can give rise to a
peculiar nucleation process.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

Attractive interactions between likely charged colloidal
or dust particles in plasma have been discussed in this ef-
fort in a view to explain the observed crystal structure
formed from these particles. The crucial point of the
model under discussion is the presence of the counter-
ion ﬂow. Its velocity u relative the dust particles is not
necessary to exceed the heat velocity ˜v of counter-ions
(or ion–acoustic velocity) as it was supposed in ref. [10].
10−2, the eﬀective attrac-
Even at small u when u/˜v

tive interaction appears to be suﬃciently strong to ensure
stability of regular hierarchies of particles oriented along

6

the ion ﬂow.

Another consequence of strong attractive interparticle
interactions is the partial surface tension γ of the dusty
phase boundary.

This concept was brieﬂy discussed by Tsytovich [17]
who estimated γ as a work necessary for construction
of a bulk liquid of the unit surface and height h. As
a result, he obtained γ = Umnph, then he took
=
100 eV that correspond to our result at M = 1 and found
10−2din cm−1 neglecting the negative sign of Um. If
γ
he accounted for Um < 0 he would get γ < 0, that is
natural as the work for construction of the coupled state
is to be negative.

Here, the surface tension is estimated on the base of
a generalization of the Fowler’s formulae taking into ac-
count the anisotropy of interparticle interactions. As a
result, the strong dependence of γ on orientation of the
10−2
dusty interface is found. In particular, when u/˜v
104 din cm−1 for
105 din cm−1 and γk ≃ −
we get γ⊥ ≃
surfaces oriented across and along the ion ﬂow, corre-
spondingly. So great positive and negative value results
in the characteristic lenticular form of the voids in dusty
plasma having no surfaces along the ion ﬂow. Such a
form was observed both under micro-gravity condition
(see Fig. 6) and in terrestrial experiments by Samsonov
and Goree (see Fig. 5d in Ref.[32]). They observed also
an appearance of a void mode as a penetration of a ﬁnger-
shaped (in a vertical section) dusty free region through
the side boundary of the gas discharge (see Fig. 5c in
Ref.[32]). A sharp end of the ﬁnger and its fast travel
across the gas discharge volume count in favor of nega-
tive surface tension of the interface at its end. It means
that an account for non-spherical form of the void is nec-
essary for any theoretical model of the void.

[20] There is no problems to account them by the way of
adding a ion-neutral collision integral to the right-hand-
side of the Vlasov equation as it was done, for example,
in [15, 21] where conditions of forming of quasi-crystal
structure in charged colloid solute were found.

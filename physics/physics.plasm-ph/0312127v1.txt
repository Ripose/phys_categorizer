We review the analytical methods of solving the stochastic equa-
tions for barrier-type dynamical behavior in plasma systems. The

A large number of physical systems, in particular in plasma physics, are
described in terms of a variable evolving in a deterministic velocity ﬁeld
under the eﬀect of a random perturbation. This is described by a stochastic
diﬀerential equation of the form

where V (x) is the velocity ﬁeld and the perturbation is the white noise

This general form has been invoked in several applications. More recently,
in a series of works devoted to the explanation of the intermittent behavior
of the statistical characteristics of the turbulence in magnetically conﬁned
plasma it has been developed a formalism based on barrier crossing. Previous
works that have discussed subcritical excitation of plasma instabilities are
Refs. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].

We oﬀer a comparative presentation of two functional integral approaches
to the determination of the statistical properties of the system’s variable x (t)
for the case where the space dependence of V (x) is characterized by the
presence of three equilibrium points, V (x) = 0. We will take

V (x) = ax

2 The functional approach

2.1 Overview of the functional methods

In studying the stochastic processes the functional methods can be very useful
and obtain systematic results otherwise less accessible to alternative methods.
The method has been developed initially in quantum theory and it is now
a basic instrument in condensed matter, ﬁeld theory, statistical physics, etc.
In general it is based on the formulation of the problem in terms of an action
functional. There are two distinct advantages from this formulation: (1) the
system’s behavior appears to be determined by all classes of trajectories that
extremize the action and their contributions are summed after appropriate
weights are applied; (2) the method naturally includes the contributions from
states close to the extrema, so that ﬂuctuations can be accounted for.

There are technical limitations to the applicability of this method. In the
statistical problems (including barrier-type problems) it is simpler to treat
cases with white noise, while colored noise can be treated perturbatively. In
the latter case, the procedure is however useful since the diagrammatic series
can be formulated systematically.

The colored noise can be treated by extending the space of variables: the
stochastic variable with ﬁnite correlation is generated by integration of a
new, white noise variable.

The one dimensional version can be developed up to ﬁnal explicit re-
sult. Since however the barrier type problem is frequently formulated in
two-dimensions, one has to look for extrema of the action and ennumerate
all possible trajectories. It is however known that, in these cases, the behav-
ior of the system is dominated by a particular path, “the optimum escape
path”, and a reasonnable approximation is to reduce the problem to a one-
dimensional one along this system’s trajectory.

2.2 The path integral with the MSR action

We will brieﬂy mention the steps of constructiong the MSR action functional,
in the Jensen path integral reformulation. We begin by choosing a particular
realisation of the noise ξ (t). All the functions and derivatives can be discre-
T, T ] (actually one can take
tised on a lattice of points in the time interval [
−
the limits to be
). The solution of the equation (1) is a “conﬁguration”
of the ﬁeld x (t) which can be seen as a point in a space of functions. We
extend the space of conﬁgurations x (t) to this space of functions, including
all possible forms of x (t), not necessarly solutions. In this space the solution

(cid:17)

Any functional of the system’s real conﬁguration (i.e. solutions of the equa-
tions) can be formally expressed by taking as argument an arbitrary func-
tional variable, multiplying by this δ functional and integrating over the space
of all functions.

We will skip the discretization and the Fourier representation of the δ
functions, followed by reverting to the continuous functions. The result is
the following functional

in view of future use to the determination of correlations. This functional
integral must be determined explicitely. The standard way to proceed to the
calculation of ZJ is to ﬁnd the saddle point in the function space and then
expand the action around this point to include the ﬂuctuating trajectories.
This requires ﬁrst to solve the Euler-Lagrange equations

which is the diﬀusion. The same mechanism will be used in the following,
with the diﬀerence that the equations cannot be solved in explicit form due
to the nonlinearity.

In general the nonlinearity can be treated by perturbation expansion, if
the amplitude can be considered small. This is an analoguous procedure as
that used in the ﬁeld theory and leads to a series of terms represented by
Feynman diagrams. We can separate in the Lagrangian the part that can

form of the deterministic velocity, V (x). Obviously, this term is k (t) x (t)3

The occurence of the ﬁrst term in the exponent is the price to pay for not
making the expansion around x0. However, such an expansion would have
3bx0) ε2k
produced two non-quadratic terms in the Lagrangian density: (
b) ε3k. This would render the perturbative expansion extremly com-
and (
plicated since we would have to introduce two vertices : one, of order four, is
that shown in Eq.(7) and another, of order three, related to the ﬁrst of the
nonlinearities mentioned above.

−

Even in the present case, the calculation appears very tedious. We have
to expand the vertex part of ZJ as an exponential, in series of powers of
the vertex operator. In the same time we have to expand the exponential in
Eq.(11) as a formal series. Then we have to apply term by term the ﬁrst series
on the second series. The individual terms can be represented by diagrams.
In this particular case we have a ﬁnite contribution even at the zero-loop
order (the “tree” graph). It is however much more diﬃcult to extract the
statistics since we will need at least the diagrams leaving two free ends with
currents J1.

In the case we examine here, the perturbative treatment is not partic-
ularly useful since the form of the potential (from which the velocity ﬁeld
is obtained) supports topologically distinct classes of saddle point solutions
and this cannot be represented by a series expansion.

2.3 The Onsager-Machlup functional

To make comparison with other approaches, we take J1,2 = 0 and integrate
over the functional variable k.

In this reference it is called the Onsager-Machlup action functional and the
analysis is based on this formula.

However, we can go further and we will ﬁnd inconsistencies. We now take

2.4 Connection between the MSR formalism and Onsager-

Machlup

In our approach the most natural way of proceeding with a stochastic diﬀeren-
tial equation is to use the MSR type reasonning in the Jensen reformulation.
The equation is discretized in space and time and selectd with δ functions
in an ensemble of functions (actually in sets of arbitrary numbers at every
point of discretization). The result is a functional integral. There is however
a particular aspect that needs careful analysis, as mentioned in the previous
Subsection. It is the problem of the Jacobian associated with the δ functions.
This problem is discussed in Ref.[41].

The equation they analyse is presented in most general form as

∂φj (t)

(Γ0)jk

This will be the starting point of our analysis.

In conclusion we have compared the two starting points in a functional
approach: The one that uses dual functions x (t) and k (t), closer in spirit to
MSR; And the approach based on Onsager-Machlup functional, traditionally
employed for the determination of the probabilities [31], [32]. Either we keep
k (t) and ignore the Jacobian (the ﬁrst approach) or integrate over k (t) and
include the Jacobian. The approaches are equivalent and, as we will show
below, lead to the same results.

A ﬁnal observation concerning the choice of one or another method:
in
the MSR method, the trajectories include the diﬀusion from the direct so-
In the Onsager-Machlup method
lution of the Euler-Lagrange equations.
the paths extremizing the action are deterministic and the diﬀusion is intro-
duced by integrating on a neighborhood in the space of function, around the
deterministic motion.

3 The transition solutions (instantons)

3.1 Numerical trajectories

The equations for the saddle point trajectory are in complex so we extend
also the variable in complex space

The obtain a system of four nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations which
can be integrated numerically.

A typical form of the solution x (t) is similar to the kink instanton (i.e. the
tanh function). The function x (t) spends very much time in the region close
to the equilibrium point; then it performs a fast transition to the neighbour
equilibrium point, where it remains for the rest of the time interval.

3.3 Typical instanton solutions

There are several well known examples of instantons. They appear in physical
systems whose lowest energy state is degenerate and the minima of the action
functional (or the energy, for stationary solutions) are separated by energy
barriers. Instantons connect these minima by performing transitions which
are only possible in imaginary time (the theory is expressed in Euclidean
space, with uniform positive metric). It is only by including these instantons
that the action functional is correctly calculated and real physical quantities
can be determined.

From this calculation we can obtain the explicit trajectories that extrem-
ize the action functional and in the same time reproduce the jump of the
system between the two distant equilibrium positions. These trajectories
will be necessary in the calculation of the functional integral. However, since
we have eliminated the external currents and integrated over the dual func-
tional variable k (t) we cannot derive the statistical properties of x (t) from
a generating functional.

3.4 Approximations of the instanton form

In the approach based on the Onsager-Machlup action the instanton is not
used in its explicit form (elliptic functions) in the calculation of the action.
The reason is that the result can be proved to depend essentially on local
properties of the potential V (x). This will be shown later.

In the approach with dual functions, one can reduce the instanton to
its simplest form, an instantaneous transition between two states, a jump

15

appearing at an arbitrary moment of time. Using this form as a ﬁrst approx-
imation we will calculate the solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations and
then the action.

stanton) solution

In a semiclassical treatment (similar to the quantum problem, where ~ is
the small diﬀusion coeﬃcient D of the present problem), the most important
contribution comes from the neighborhood of the classical trajectories, xc (τ )
that extremalizes the action S.

departure of such a solution from the classical one (the instanton) cannot be
considered small.

In general, for a function U (x) that has two minima separated by a barrier
(a maximum) the potential W (x) calculated form the action will have three

which is appears in the equation of motion, will have three maxima in general
W (x) at these maxima
nondegenerate and the diﬀerences in the values of

that D is small, the non-degeneracy is also small. The previous discussion
in which the notion of instanton was introduced and K was calculated, take
into consideration the degenerate maxima and the instanton transition at
equal initial and ﬁnal W .

W (x) to order one in D
that has degenerate maxima. This potential will be called W (0) (x) and it
will be considered in the calculation of the contribution of the instantons and
antiinstantons.

If we want to calculate the integral of the kinetic energy along the trajec-
tory, we have to consider separately the intervals where the kinetic energy
is strongly determined by the velocity, i.e. the region where the instanton
transition occurs, from the rest of the trajectory where, the velocity being
practically zero, the potential is a better description and can be easily ap-
proximated. The approximation will relay on the fact that the particle is
practically imobile in b or in 0, after the transition has been made. So we
will use both expressions for the kinetic energy

NOTE Since the trajectory xIA (τ ; t0, t1) is not an exact solution of the
equation of motion in the potential W , the expansion of the action S will
not be limitted to the zeroth and the second order terms. It will also contain
a ﬁrts order term, (δS/δx)
|x=xc(τ ) . It can be shown that this contribution is
negligible in the order O (D).

The calculation of the contribution to the functional integral from the sec-
ond order expansion around xIA is done as usual by ﬁnding the eigenvalues of
the determinant of the corresponding operator. As before, the product of the
eigenvalues should not include the ﬁrst eigenvalue since this is connected with
the translational symmetry of the instanton solution. This time there will
be two eigenvalues, one for t0 (the transition performed by the b
0 instan-
ton) and the second for t1 (the transition prtformed by the antiinstanton, or
b). Another way of expressing this invariance to the two
the transition 0
time translations is to say that the pair of instantons has not a determined
central moment and, in addition, there is an internal degree of freedom of
the breathing solution, which actually is this pair instanton-antiinstanton.

→

→

To take into account these modes, whose eigenvalues are zero, we need to

integrate in the functional integral, over the two times, t0 and t1.

The measure of integration for the two translational symmetries t0 and

t1 is

Sb0
2πD
This quantity is the Jacobian of the change of variables in the functional
integration over the ﬂuctuations around the instanton solution. The ﬂuctua-
tion that corresponds to the lowest (almost zero) eigenvalue is replaced in the
measure of integration with the diﬀerential of the time variable representing
the moment of transition. Then it results this Jacobian.

It can be shown that in the approximation given by exponentially small
terms, the contribution to the path integral of the small ﬂuctuations around
the classical instanton-antiinstanton xIA solution is the product of the ﬂuc-
tuation terms around the instanton and antiinstanton separately.

4.3.2 The formulation using dual functions

We will use the functional approach in the setting that has been developed
by us to the calculation of the probability of transition from one minimum
to the same minimum with an intermediate stay at the unstable maximum
point (symmetric potential).
The initial equation is

The action functional with external current added is

J1

We have to solve these equations, and replace the solutions x (t) and k (t) in
the action functional. Then the functional derivatives to the external current
J1 (t) will give us the correlations for the stochastic variable x (t). We can
also calculate the probability that the particle, starting from one point at a
certain time will be found at another point at other time. This will be done
below.

The ﬁrst step is to obtain an analytical solution to the Euler-Lagrange
equation. The method to solve these equation is essentially a successive
approximation, as we have done above, for the diﬀusive motion around a
stable position in the potential (harmonic region). We know that the classical
trajectory must be of the type of a transition between the initial point, taken
here as the left minimum of the potential and the ﬁnal point, the unstable
maximum of the potential. From there, the particle will return to the left
minimum by an inverse transition. We have to calculate simultaneously x (t)
and k (t), but we have suﬃcient information to ﬁnd an approximation for
x (t), by neglecting the eﬀect of diﬀusion (the last term in the diﬀerential
equation for x (t)).

This solution is a transition between either of the minima
It shows the same characteristics as found numerically or by integrating the
elliptic form of the equation, in the case of Onasger-Machlup action. The
particle spends long time in the initial and ﬁnal points and makes a fast
transition between them at an arbitrary time t0. The width of transition is
small compared to the rest of quasi-imobile stays in the two points, especially
if a is large. Then we will make an approximation, taking the solution as

t.
In the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Jensen approach it is derived the generating
functional as a functional integration over this statistical ensemble of a weight
measure expressed as the exponential of the classical action. Now we restrict
the statistical ensemble by imposing that the particle is found at time t = tc
in the point x = xc. By integration this will give us precisely the probability

The only problem is the need to consider the reverse of sign due to the

In the tratment of Caroli, it is

4.4 The trajectory reﬂection and the integration along

the contour in the complex time plane

The problem arises at the examination of the Eq.(32) where it is noticed that
the constant C multiplying the exponential term in the exponential in the
integrations over t0 and t1 is positive (see Eq.(33)). Then the dependence of
t0 makes that the most important contribution to the

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
This would imply, in physical terms, that the most important conﬁgurations
contributing to the path integral would be pairs of instanton anti-instanton
very closely separated, i.e. transitions with very short time of stay in the
point 0. This is not correct since we expect that in large time regime the
trajectories assembled from instantons and anti-instantons with arbitrary
large separations (duration of residence in 0 before returning to b) should
contribute to K.

This problem can be solved by extending the integration over the variable

representing the time separation between the transitions

in complex.

NOTE. The quantity

z = t1 −

t0

(2W ′′

0 )1/2 = ω0

is the frequency of the harmonic oscillations in the parabolic approximation
of the potential.

The contour C is deﬁned as

The form of the trajectory xIA connecting the point b to itself, b, assembled
from one instanton xI and one anti-instanton xA can now be described as
follows.

The trajectory starts in the point b and follows the usual form of the

instanton solution, which means that for times

t

−

< τ . t0

−

it practically conicides with the ﬁxed position b. At t0 it makes the transition
to the point 0, the duration of the transition (width of the instanton) being
∆t. Then it remains almost ﬁxed at the point 0. The problem is that there
is no turning point at x = 0 since there the potential
W (x) is smaller than
at x = b. Then we do not have the classical instanton which takes an inﬁnite
time to reach exactly x = 0, etc. Also there is no exact instanton solution
which starts from x = 0 to go back to x = b.
In the assambled solution
xI + xA, there is a discontinuity at x = 0 in the derivative, the velocity
simply is forced (assumed) to change from almost zero positive (directed
toward x = 0) to almost zero negative (directed toward x = b). What we
do is to introduce a turning point, which limits eﬀectively the transition
solution, but for this we have to go to complex time, to compensate for the
negative value of the potential. Making time imaginary changes the sign of
the velocity squared (kinetic energy) and correspondingly can be seen as a
change of sign of the potential which now becomes positive and presents a
wall from where the solution can reﬂect. This is actually a local Euclidean-
ization of the theory, around the point x = 0.

At time (t0 + t1) /2 the trajectory starts moving along the imaginary z
and returns to the point

axis. It reaches an imaginary turning point at

Re z = xIA

t0+t1

, Im z = 0.

This trajectory can be considered the limiting form of the trajectory of
a ﬁctitious particle that traverses a part of potential (forbidden classically)
when this part goes to zero.

Again we have to introduce a new potential replacing W . The real potential

These trajectories are rather artiﬁcially, being assambled form pieces of true
solutions. They have singularities: in the middel, at (t1 + t2) /2 the function
is continuous but the derivative is discontinuous; in the points where one
instanton arrives and another must continue (i.e. (t0 + t1) /2 and (t2 + t3) /2,
both the function and the derivatives are discontinuous.

The z2 integral; The z2 integral involves only the exponential of G (z2)
and the latter function does not contain a term proportional with Re z2
(comapre with (43)), but only the exponential term. The function G (z2)
is very close to 1 as soon as

Finally we note that only the constant C0 relative to the intermediate
point 0 appears, and the one for the farthest point of the trajectory, a, is
absent.

There will be then a time integration over the moment of the ﬁrst transi-
tion, t0, of an integrand that contains the time t arising from the integration
on the contour C2, in the complex plane of the variable z2 = t2 −
t1. This

45

variable represents the duration between the last transition to a and the ﬁrst
transition from a, i.e. is the duration of stay in a. This time integration will
produce a term with t2.

Replacing in the expressions resulting from the integrations on z1 and z3

the constant C0 from (45) the factors xm and xp disappear.

Since the points of start and/or arrival x0, x are diﬀerent of b, a, there is
ﬁnite (i.e. non exponentially small) slope of the solution, and there is nomore
degeneracy with respect to the translation of the center of the instantons.
then there will be not a proportionality with time in the one-instanton term.

6 Results

In the following we reproduce the graphs of the time-dependent probability
distribution of a system governed by the basic Langevin equation. Various
initialisations are considered, showing rapid redistribution of the density of
presence of the system. The speed of redistribuition is, naturally, connected
to the asymmetry of the potential. Each ﬁgure consists of a set of graphs:

•

•

•

the potential functions V (x), U(x) and W (x)

four probabilities of passage from and between the two equilibrium
points a and b;

the average value of the position of the system, as function of time, for
the two most characteristic initializations

The two parameters a and D take diﬀerent values, for illustration.

Appendix A : Time variation for general form
of the potential

The stochastic motion is described in terms of the conditional probability
P (x, t; xi, 0) that the particle initially (t = 0) at xi to be at the point x at
time t. We will use the notation that suppress the 0 as the initial time,
P (x, t; xi). The conditional probability obeys the following Fokker-Planck
equation

where the velocity function is here derived from the potential U

[U ′ (x) P ] + D

since there is no drive. The initial condition for the probability function is

In order to calculate explicitely the functional integral we look ﬁrst for
the paths x (t) that extremize the action. They are provided by the Euler-
Lagrange equations, which reads

xc (t) = x

The ﬁrst thing to do after ﬁnding the extremizing paths is to calculate
the action functional along them, Sc. After obtaining these extremum paths
we have to consider the contribution to the functional integral of the paths
situated in the neighborhood and this is done by expanding the action to
second order. The argument of the expansion is the diﬀerence between a path
from this neigborhood and the extremum path. The functional integration
over these diﬀerences can be done since it is Gaussian and the result is
expressed in terms of the determinant of the operator resulting from the
second order expansion of S. Then the expression (A.1) becomes

There is a fundamental problem concerning the use of the equation (A.2).
It depends on the possibility that all the eigenvalues from the Eq.(A.4) are
determined. However, a path connecting a point in the neigborhood of the
maximum of U (x),

is a kinklike solution. This solution (which will be replaced in the expression
of the operator in Eq.(A.4) contains a parameter, the “center” of the kink,
t0. This is an arbitrary parameter since the moment of traversation is ar-
bitrary. The equation for the eigenvalues has therefore a symmetry at time
translations of t0 and has as a consequence the appearence of a zero eigen-
value. Then the expression of the determinant would be inﬁnite and the rate
of transfer would vanish. Actually, the time translation invariance is treated
by considering the arbitrary moment t0 as a new variable and performing a
change of variable, from the set of functions φn to the set
. The
trajectory that extremizes the action is a kinklike solution x (τ , t0) (is not
exactly a kink since the shape of the potential is not that which produces
the tanh solution) connecting the points :

t0, φn,n6=0

(cid:1)

This treatment then consists of considering t0 as a collective coordinate (see

Eq.(A.2) is

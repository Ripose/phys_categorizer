Abstract

We investigate the acceleration of electrons via their interaction with electro-
static waves, driven by the relativistic Buneman instability, in a system dominated
by counter-propagating proton beams. We observe the growth of these waves and
their subsequent saturation via electron trapping for a range of proton beam ve-
locities, from 0.15c to 0.9c. We can report a reduced stability of the electrostatic
wave (ESW) with increasing non-relativistic beam velocities and an improved wave
stability for increasing relativistic beam velocities, both in accordance with previous
ﬁndings. At the highest beam speeds, we ﬁnd the system to be stable again for a
period of
160 plasma periods. Furthermore we observe a, to our knowledge, pre-
viously unreported secondary electron acceleration mechanism at low beam speeds.
We believe that it is the result of parametric couplings to produce high phase ve-
locity ESW’s which then trap electrons, accelerating them to higher energies. This
allows electrons in our simulation study to achieve the injection energy required for
Fermi acceleration, for beam speeds as low as 0.15c in unmagnetised plasma.

Introduction

Supernova remnant (SNR) shocks, created by the interaction between an expanding
supernova blast shell and the ambient medium, are believed to be a signiﬁcant source
[2004]), with energies up to 1014
of cosmic rays (Reynolds [2001]; Lazendic et al.
eV, the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum (Nagano & Watson [2000]; Aharonian et
al. [2004]; V¨olk et al. [1988]).

First order Fermi acceleration has been proposed as a mechanism for the accel-
eration of electrons to ultra-relativistic velocities in SNR shocks (Bell [1978a]; Bell
[1978b]; Blandford & Ostriker [1978]). Electrons gain energy by repeated crossings
of the shock front, and by their scattering oﬀ MHD waves on either side of the shock.
The orientation of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld ~B relative to the shock normal has
implications for the eﬃciency of electron acceleration (Galeev [1984]). We consider
the case where the ambient ﬁeld is orthogonal to the shock normal, this geometry
provides an eﬃcient electron acceleration mechanism for high Mach number shocks
(Treumann & Terasawa [2001]). First order Fermi acceleration at such shocks re-
quires a seed population of electrons that have Larmor radii comparable to the shock
thickness. Since the shock thickness is, for perpendicular shocks, of the order of the
ion Larmor radius, the electrons of this seed population must have mildly relativistic
initial speeds. A kinetic energy comparable to 100 keV is believed to be suﬃcient
(Treumann & Terasawa [2001]). Such electrons are unlikely to be present, neither
in the interstellar medium (ISM) nor in the stellar wind of the progenitor star of the
supernova, but may be created by a pre-acceleration mechanism at the SNR shock
front. This pre-acceleration, commonly referred to as the injection problem, is not
well understood.

As the shock front of a supernova remnant (SNR) expands into the ISM, it
reﬂects a substantial fraction of the ISM ions as observed in simulations (Shimada
& Hoshino [2000]; Schmitz et al.
[2002]) and in-situ at the Earth’s bow shock
(Eastwood et al. [2005]). If the shock normal is quasi-perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld in a high Mach number shock, as many as 20% of the ions can be reﬂected
(Sckopke et al.
[1983]; Galeev [1984]; Lembege & Savoini [1992]; Lembege et al.
[2004]). The reﬂected ions form a beam that can reach a peak speed comparable
to twice the shock speed in the ISM frame of reference as, for example, discussed
by McClements et al. ([1997]). The shock-reﬂected plasma particles are a source of
free energy, similar to the shock-generated cosmic rays (Zank et al.
[1990]) which
are also thought to heat the inﬂowing plasma. However, the shock reﬂected ion
beam is considerably more dense than the cosmic rays and each particle carries
less energy. The developing plasma thermalisation mechanisms are thus likely to
be diﬀerent. Since binary collisions between charged particles in the dilute ISM
plasma are negligible, these ion beams relax by their interaction with electrostatic
waves and electromagnetic waves. In what follows, we focus on the interaction of
electrons with high-frequency electrostatic waves (ESWs) that are driven by two-
stream instabilities.

Recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation studies (Shimada & Hoshino [2003]; Shi-
[2004a]; Mc-
mada & Hoshino [2004]; Dieckmann et al.
Clements et al.
[2001]) have examined these mechanisms with a particular focus
on how and up to what energies the ESWs driven by non-relativistic or mildly
relativistic ion beams can accelerate the electrons in the foreshock region.

[2000]; Dieckmann et al.

The maximum energy the electrons can reach by such wave-particle interactions,
depends on the life-time of the saturated ESW and on the strength and the orien-

move back into the upstream region and form beam 1. The upstream ~B rotates beam

and one dimensional.

tation of ~B. Initially a stable non-linear wave known as BGK mode (Bernstein et
al. [1957]; Manfredi [1997]; Brunetti et al. [2000]) develops if the plasma is unmag-
netised or if the magnetic ﬁeld is weak (McClements et al.
[2001]; Dieckmann et
al. [2002]; Eliasson, Dieckmann & Shukla [2005]). Such modes are associated with
phase space holes - islands of trapped electrons. These BGK modes are destabilised
by the sideband instability, a resonance between the electrons that oscillate in the
ESW potential and secondary ESWs (Kruer et al.
[1969]; Tsunoda & Malmberg
[1989]; Krasovsky [1994]). This resonance transfers energy from the trapped elec-
trons to the secondary ESWs. The initial BGK mode collapses, once these secondary
ESWs grow to an amplitude that is comparable to that of the initial wave.

Many previous simulations of two-stream instabilities in the context of electron
injection and of shocks have employed PIC simulation codes, which suﬀer from
high noise levels (Dieckmann et al.
[2004c]) and from a dynamical range for the
plasma phase space distribution that is limited by the number of computational
It is thus possible that certain instabilities can not develop, due to a
particles.
lack of computational particles in the relevant phase space interval, or that the
phase space structures (e.g. BGK modes) are destabilised by the noise (Schamel &
Korn [1996]) and may beneﬁt from a plasma model based on the direct solution of
the Vlasov equation. Such eﬀects have been demonstrated in the non-relativistic
limit, for example by Eliasson, Dieckmann & Shukla ([2005]) and Dieckmann et
al. ([2004b]), in which the results computed by PIC codes have been compared to
those of Vlasov codes. The particle species in a Vlasov code are represented by a
continuous distribution function, conventionally evolved on a ﬁxed Eulerian grid,
rather than by simulation macro-particles. The comparison of results from these
two methodologies has shown signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the life-time of the BGK
modes both for unmagnetized and magnetized plasma.

SNR shocks typically expand into the ISM at speeds ranging between a few and
[1998]). The shock-reﬂected ions can thus

twenty percent of c (Kulkarni et al.

0.4c if the reﬂection is specular (McClements et al.

[1997])
reach a speed of vb ≈
or even higher speeds if we take into account shock surﬁng acceleration (Ucer &
Shapiro [2001]; Shapiro & Ucer [2003]). The proton-beam driven ESWs have a
phase speed similar to vb (Buneman [1958]; Thode & Sudan [1973]). Since the
ISM electrons can be accelerated to a maximum speed well in excess of the phase
speed of the ESW (Rosenzweig [1988]), we must consider relativistic modiﬁcations
It has been found
of the life-time of the BGK modes in SNR foreshock plasma.
by Dieckmann et al. ([2004a]) that the BGK mode is stabilised if the phase speed
of the ESW is relativistic in the ISM frame of reference. The likely reason is that
the change in the relativistic electron mass introduces a strong dependence of the
electron bouncing frequency on the electron speed in the ESW frame of reference.
This decreases the coherency with which the electrons interact with the secondary
ESWs and thus the eﬃciency of the sideband instability. The stabilization is clearly
visible in PIC simulations for ESWs moving with a phase speed of 0.9c (Dieckmann
et al. [2004a]). For speeds vb < 0.7c the relativistic modiﬁcations of the BGK mode
stability have been small in the PIC simulations (Dieckmann et al.
[2004a]). The
better representation of the phase space density aﬀorded by a Vlasov simulation
may, however, yield a diﬀerent result and it requires a further examination.

We thus focus in this work on the modelling of electrostatic instabilities by means
of relativistic Vlasov simulations and we assess the impact of these instabilities as a
potential pre-acceleration mechanism. To this end, we neglect magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects
and consider only the one-dimensional electrostatic system, which is equivalent to
the approach taken by Dieckmann et al. ([2004a]) but at a much larger dynamical
range for the plasma phase space distribution. This description serves as simple
model for the stability of ESWs by which we identify similarities and diﬀerences
between the results provided by PIC and Vlasov simulations. Future work will
expand the simulations to include magnetic ﬁelds, which introduces electron surﬁng
acceleration (ESA) (Katsouleas & Dawson [1983]; McClements et al.
[2001]) and
stochastic particle orbits (Mohanty & Naik [1998]), and multiple dimensions.

More speciﬁcally, we examine by relativistic electrostatic Vlasov simulations
(Arber & Vann [2002]; Sircombe et al. [2005]) how the BGK mode life-time and its
collapse in an unmagnetised plasma depend on vb and thus on the phase speed of the
ESW. The purpose is twofold. First, we extend the comparison of results provided
by PIC and by Vlasov codes beyond the nonrelativistic regime in Dieckmann et al.
([2004b]). We perform Vlasov simulations for initial conditions that are identical to
those in Dieckmann et al. ([2004a]) where a PIC simulation code (Eastwood [1991])
has been used. We ﬁnd a good agreement of the results of the relativistic Vlasov
code and the PIC code for relativistic vb and with the corresponding result provided
by the nonrelativistic Vlasov code (Eliasson [2002]; Dieckmann et al. [2004b]). We
thus bring forward further evidence for both, an increasing destabilisation of BGK
modes for increasing nonrelativistic phase speeds of the wave and a stabilisation
for increasing relativistic phase speeds. Secondly we want to exploit the much
higher dynamical range of Vlasov simulations to examine the wave spectrum and the
particle energy spectrum that we obtain by the considered nonlinear interactions.
We ﬁnd that the collapse of the BGK modes couples energy to three families of
waves. Firstly a continuum of electrostatic waves that move with approximately
the beam speed. These waves are connected to the turbulent electron phase space
ﬂow. Secondly we ﬁnd for high beam speeds the growth of quasi-monochromatic
modes with frequency comparable to the Doppler-shifted bouncing frequency of the
trapped electrons in the wave potential. These waves would be sideband modes

(Kruer et al.
[1969]). Thirdly we ﬁnd waves that do not have a clear connection
to any characteristic particle speed. We believe that these modes are produced
by parametric instabilities. These modes can reach phase speeds well above the
maximum speed the initial trapped electron population reaches, and they grow to
amplitudes at which they can trap electrons, i.e. a BGK mode cascade to high
speeds develops. By this trapping cascade, the electrons can reach momenta well
[2000]; Dieckmann et
in excess of those reported previously (Dieckmann et al.
al.
[2004a]). This result would imply that the ion beams, that are reﬂected by
shocks that expand at speeds comparable to SNR shocks, can accelerate electrons
to energies in excess of 100 keV, at which they can undergo Fermi acceleration to
higher energies.

2 The physical model, the linear instability and the

simulation setup

2.1 Physical model

We consider a small interval of the ISM plasma just ahead of the SNR shock (see
Fig. 1) and we treat the ISM plasma as an electron proton plasma with a spatially
homogeneous Maxwellian velocity distribution. We place our simulation box close
to the SNR shock, so that the shock-reﬂected ISM protons can cross it. The protons,
that have just been reﬂected, constitute beam 1, beam 2 represents the protons that
return to the shock after they have been rotated by the global foreshock magnetic
ﬁeld. Our model is in line with that discussed, for example, by McClements et al.
([1997]) and solved numerically, e.g. for unmagnetized plasma by Dieckmann et al.
([2000, 2004a, 2004b]) and for magnetized plasma by McClements et al. ([2001])
and by Shimada & Hoshino ([2004]).

We set ~B = 0, and thus, exclude electromagnetic instabilities, e.g. Whistler
waves (Kuramitsu & Krasnoselskikh [2005]), MHD waves, and electrostatic waves
in magnetised plasma, e.g. electron cyclotron waves. However, by this choice we
decouple the development of competing instabilities and we can consider them sep-
arately. In this work we focus on ESWs and the nonlinear BGK modes, which are
important phase space structures in the foreshocks of Solar system plasma shocks
(Treumann & Terasawa [2001]).

The system is, with the choice ~B = 0, suitable for modelling with an electro-
static and relativistic Vlasov-Poisson solver. The size of the simulation box is small
compared to the distance across which the beam parameters change. Thus we can
take periodic boundary conditions for the simulation and spatially homogeneous
Maxwellian distributions for both beams. Both beams have the same mean speed
, but move into opposite directions which gives a zero net current in
modulus,
the simulation box. We take a higher temperature for beam 2 than for beam 1 to
reﬂect the scattering of the beam protons as they move through the foreshock. We
show the velocity distributions in Fig. 2

vb|
|

The choice of ~B = 0 is a critical limitation of the model. The initial conditions
described above could not fully describe a perpendicular shock and with ~B = 0
one could not account for the presence of a returning proton beam. We assume
that, while the ﬁeld is neglected over the simulation box, the ﬁeld outside the box
is suﬃcient to produce the proton beam structure described. Therefore, the results
presented here are not directly applicable to the foreshock dynamics of high Mach
number shocks. However, they provide an overview of processes that require a large

Fig. 2: The initial velocity distribution showing the ISM electrons and protons, proton
beam 1 and proton beam 2. The expanding SNR shock reﬂects a fraction of the ISM
protons which form beam 1. The upstream ~B rotates beam 1 to create beam 2. Since the
beam has been scattered by ESWs on its path through the foreshock, its thermal spread
has increased. Both beams can grow ESWs with a speed similar to vb which saturate by
their interaction with the ISM electrons. By assuming that the plasma parameters do
not change over the small box size we consider, we can represent this plasma by the 4
spatially homogeneous species shown.

dynamical range for the plasma phase space distribution and which may, therefore,
not have been observed in previous PIC simulations. Our system is applicable
to parts of the foreshock of perpendicular shocks, where magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
(Jun & Jones [1999]) cause the magnetic ﬁeld to vanish or to be beam aligned. It may
also apply to the ﬁeld aligned ion beams that are observed in the foreshock region
of the Earth’s bow shock (Eastwood et al. [2005]) and which may be present also at
SNR shocks. Here, the second proton beam in our initial conditions takes the role
of the return current in the plasma which is typically provided by all plasma species
(Lovelace & Sudan [1971]). Interactions between two BGK modes in unmagnetized
plasma aﬀect primarily the velocity interval that is conﬁned by the phase speeds of
the two waves (Escande [1982]). Our results, which focus on the developing high
energy tails of the plasma distribution, may thus not depend on the exact setting
of the initial return current and may be more universally applicable.

2.2 Linear instability

We introduce the plasma frequency of each species i as ωp,i = (e2ni/miǫ0)
where
e, ni, mi and ǫ0 are the magnitude of the elementary charge, the number density
of species i in the rest frame of the species, the particle mass of species i and the
dielectric constant. In what follows we deﬁne all ωp,i in the box frame of reference.

Species 1 and 2 are the ISM electrons and protons. The species 3 is beam 1 and
species 4 is beam 2. The large inertia of species 2 compared to species 1 implies,
that its contribution to the linear dispersion relation can be neglected. The linear
dispersion relation then becomes in the cold plasma limit

During the linear growth phase, each proton beam will grow an ESW by its stream-
ing relative to the electrons. Both waves are well separated in their phase speed
and the linear dispersion relation can be solved separately for each ESW by neglect-
ing either the term with ωp,3 or ωp,4 in Eq. 1 (Buneman [1958]; Thode & Sudan

(Galeev [1984]). This density ratio gives ωp,1/ωp,3
and a growth rate

. The growth rate is reduced by increasing temperatures of the
plasma. The wave length of the most unstable ESW is λu = 2π/ku. The sideband
instability couples energy to modes with k
ku, for non-relativistic phase speeds
of the wave (Krasovsky [1994]). We thus set the simulation box length to L = 2λu
to resolve more than one unstable sideband mode, which leads to a wave collapse
(Dieckmann et al. [2000]).

This L is short compared to the typical size of the foreshock which justiﬁes our
spatially homogeneous initial conditions and periodic boundary conditions. We use
the amplitudes of the initial ESW and that of the sideband modes as indicators
for the wave collapse. We deﬁne l as the index of the simulation cell, xl = l∆x,
kj = 2πj/Nx∆x and Nx, as the number of simulation cells in x. The index m refers
to the data time step m∆t, where ∆t is the time interval between outputs rather
than the simulation time step. We Fourier Transform the spatio-temporal ESW

The amplitude of the ESW with k = ku at the simulation time tm is then given by
E(k2, tm).

To analyse the nonlinear and time dependent processes developing after the
saturation of the ESW, we introduce a Window Fourier Transform. We deﬁne the
window size, in time steps, as Nt and we introduce ωn = n∆ω = n(2π/Nt∆t) as

The Vlasov-Poisson system is solved using a parallelised version of the code detailed
in Arber & Vann ([2002]) and Sircombe et al. ([2005]). This uses a split Eulerian
scheme in which the distribution functions (fe, fp) are calculated on a ﬁxed Eulerian
grid. The solver is split into separate spatial and momentum space updates (Cheng
& Knorr [1976]). These updates are one dimensional, constant velocity advections
carried out using the piecewise parabolic method (Colella & Woodward [1984]).

Throughout our simulations we adopt a realistic mass ratio, mp/me = Mr, of
Mr = 1836 and resolve L by 512 cells in the x
direction, each with length ∆x =
πvb/128ωp,1. To accurately resolve the ﬁlamented phase space distributions of the
particles that result from the sideband instability (McClements et al.
[2001]), we
use a momentum-space grid with between 4096 and 16384 grid points (Np). This
ensures that the momentum grid spacing for each species, ∆px,i, is small. Speciﬁ-
cally, ∆px,i < 0.1mivth,i where v2

where κ and Ti are the Boltzmann constant and the temperature of species i.

We set the temperatures of the four species to T1 = 5.4

In order to excite the linear instability, we add to the proton distribution (species

density. The minimum beam speed of vb = 0.15c we examine here corresponds to

spacial units are identical for all beam speeds.

3.1 Growth and non-linear Saturation of the Bune-

man instability

Figure 3 shows the initial growth stage of the most unstable mode, E(k = ku),
for a range of initial beam velocities. From these we estimate the growth rate of
the instability (Ω), in normalised units, to be 0.0256, 0.0264, 0.0270, 0.0246, 0.0201
and 0.0137 for beam speeds of vb = 0.15c, 0.2c, 0.4c, 0.6c, 0.8c and 0.9c, respectively.
These compare favourably with the linear theory. Writing α(vb) as the ratio between
0.81,
0.79, α(0.2c)
observed and theoretical growth rates we ﬁnd; α(0.15c)
α(0.4c)
0.72. As explained in

≈
Dieckmann et al. ([2004a]), where a similar systematic reduction has been observed
in PIC simulations (in this case by 15-20%), this might be connected with the
fast growth rate of the instability itself since it results in a considerable spread in
frequency for the unstable wave. This makes the treatment of the instability in
terms of single frequencies (ωu) inaccurate.
In truth, the growth rate should be
lower since the energy of the unstable wave is spread over damped frequencies.

The ESWs saturate by the trapping of electrons and the formation of BGK
modes. This is shown in Fig. 4, for the case of vb = 0.2c, and Fig. 5 for vb =

velocity of vb = 0.2c. The exponential growth of the ESW is in the process of saturating
via the trapping of electrons, forming a BGK mode at p
+0.2.. The thermal spread
of beam 2 inhibits its growth slightly, allowing the system to become dominated by one

0.9c. Here we see the appearance of phase-space holes characteristic of particle
trapping. While the saturation mechanism is the same in both cases, for the high
velocity beam we observe the development of two counter-propagating BGK modes.
This is because at lower beam speeds the ESW instability driven by the cooler
beam (at +vb) dominates whereas for higher, relativistic, beam speeds forwards and
backwards propagating ESWs grow in unison. At lower beam speeds the increased
temperature of beam 2 (species 4) is more signiﬁcant, since the thermal velocity of
the beam is a larger proportion of the beam speed than is the case at vb = 0.9c.
Thus, the growth rate for the hot beam is suﬃciently reduced for the system to
be dominated by the growth of the cooler proton beam (species 3). We do observe
the growth of a counter propagating ESW which begins to trap electrons after t =
150. However, the ﬁnal momentum distribution is clearly dominated by electrons
accelerated by the ESW with positive phase velocity. At vb = 0.9c, the thermal
spread of both proton beams is negligible in comparison to the beam velocities and
we observe the growth and saturation of ESWs associated with both beams.

3.2 Wave collapse and secondary electron trapping

Trapping of electrons in electrostatic waves produces BGK modes which eventually
collapse via the sideband instability. The sideband instability is due to the nonlinear
oscillations of the electrons in the potential of the ESW. For electrons close to the
bottom of the wave potential, their oscillation is that of a harmonic oscillator. The
monochromatic bouncing frequency is Doppler shifted, due to the phase speed of the
ESW. These sidebands can couple the electron energy to secondary high-frequency

Fig. 5: Contour plot of log(fe > 10−6) at time t = 200 for a system with a relativistic
initial beam velocity of vb = 0.9c. The exponential growth of the ESW is in the process
of saturating via the trapping of electrons, forming a pair of BGK modes at p
3.
The reduced signiﬁcance of the higher temperature of species 4, with respect to species
3, at high beam speeds allows the growth of forwards and backwards propagating ESWs
simultaneously. Here x is given in units of 2π/ku.

ESWs, which must have a wave number k
ku (Krasovsky [1994]). The sideband
instability is a limiting factor for the lifetime of the ESW which has implications in
the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld in particular. To demonstrate this we show
in Fig. 6 the amplitude of the ESW driven by beam 1 at k = ku for beam speeds
ranging from 0.15c to 0.9c. We ﬁnd that the ESWs moving at nonrelativistic phase
speeds saturate smoothly, which is in line with the wave saturation of the ESW in the
Vlasov simulation in Dieckmann et al. ([2004b]). Their lifetime is signiﬁcant and,
in the presence of a weak external magnetic ﬁeld ~B orthogonal to the wave vector
~k, the trapped electrons would undergo substantial ESA (Eliasson, Dieckmann &
~B
and the comparatively low vph
Shukla [2005]). The ESA is proportional to vph|
would limit the maximum energy the electrons can reach.

The ESW driven by the beam with vb = 0.6c grows to a larger amplitude and
then collapses abruptly, which conﬁrms the ﬁnding in Dieckmann et al. ([2004b])
that the BGK modes become more unstable the larger the ratio between beam speed
~k
~B
to electron thermal speed becomes. The Lorentz force evph|
⊥
would be signiﬁcantly higher than for the case vb = 0.15, however the short lifetime
of the wave would here prevent electrons from reaching highly relativistic speeds.
By increasing the beam speed to vb = 0.9c we obtain a stabilisation of the ESW, in
line with the results in Dieckmann et al. ([2004a]). Here the Lorentz force is strong
and the lifetime of the saturated ESW is long constituting a formidable electron
accelerator, provided the ﬁeld evolution is not strongly inﬂuenced by ~B.

We now summarise the principal results from each beam speed. Note that in
particular the ESWs driven by the mildly relativistic proton beams show oscillations
after their initial saturation. To identify the origin of these ﬂuctuations we apply a

speeds saturate smoothly and stabilise brieﬂy. At vb = 0.6 the ESW collapses abruptly
and at relativistic beam speeds, vb = 0.9c we observe a stabilisation of the ESW for a
period of almost 1000ω−1

3.3 Beam speed, vb = 0.15c.

In Fig. 7 we ﬁnd a strongly asymmetric ESW growth for vb = 0.15c. Here the ther-
mal spread of the individual plasma species is not small compared to vb. Therefore
the ESW driven by the cooler beam 1 grows and saturates ﬁrst. It rapidly collapses
and this collapse inhibits a further growth of the ESW driven by beam 2. The
initial monochromatic ESW collapses into a broad wave continuum centred around
ω = ωp,1. We ﬁnd the equivalent broad wave continuum for k = ku/2 centred at
ω = ωp,1/2. These waves propagate at phase speeds comparable to vb and represent
the structures remaining of the initial BGK mode. The ESW spectrum at k = ku/2
further shows two wave bands that are separated by a frequency of ωp,1 from the
main peak. These two wave bands could be pumped by a beat between the turbu-
lent structure centred at ω = ωp,1/2, k = ku/2, the turbulent structure centred at
ω = ωp,1 and k = ku and the Langmuir wave with k = ku/2. Evidence for this is

The large amplitudes of both bands suggests that they might also be trapping

we see from Fig. 11. The peak energy of the two counter-propagating ESWs is
now comparable. Since we keep the thermal spread of the beams constant while
increasing vb, the thermal eﬀects are reduced and the growth rate of both waves
approaches the peak growth rate for the cold beam instability. We ﬁnd the growth
of ESWs at k = ku with
2ωp,1. Since these ESWs have the same wave
number as the initial wave they can not be produced by self-interaction of the
initial ESW since this would also double the wave number. Instead we believe that
these high frequency waves correspond to the Doppler shifted bouncing frequency of
the trapped electrons in the potential of the strong ESW. The fastest electrons reach
approximately twice the phase speed vph of the ESW as can be seen, for example,
at the lower beam speed of vb = 0.2c in Fig. 4. These electrons are thus, due to
the ﬁxed wave number ku of the BGK modes, interacting with secondary ESWs

The ESW wave spectrum for vb = 0.6c is similar to that for vb = 0.4c. Again we
ﬁnd that both beams grow strong ESWs close to

stronger ESW driven by beam 1 that stabilises while that driven by beam 2 collapses
into a broadband spectrum. This is also reﬂected by the ESW spectrum at ku/2

The phase speeds of these ESWs is higher than the peak speed the electrons reach
in the inital BGK mode as shown in Fig. 13. We can thus not explain its growth
by a streaming instability between the trapped electrons and, for example, the
untrapped electrons. We can obtain phase speeds of the ESW bands that are higher
than the speed of the trapped electron beam, however, by applying the relativistic

These sideband modes driven by the beams of trapped electrons have a phase
speed that is just below c and a large amplitude. Since their phase speed is compara-
ble to the fastest speed the electrons reach in the initial BGK mode, they should be
capable of trapping some of these electrons. This is conﬁrmed by Fig. 14 where we
ﬁnd BGK modes centred at the momentum p/mec
3.4 which accelerate electrons
up to the peak momentum p/mec

3.7 Beam speed, vb = 0.8c and vb = 0.9c.

As we increase the beam speed to vb = 0.8c the qualitative evolution of the ESWs
changes. At this high beam speed the thermal spread of the plasma species is
negligible. The growth rates of the waves for both beams is approximately that of
the cold beam instability and the ESWs grow symmetrically. Both saturated ESWs
are stable. After the saturation each ESW shows a sideband, similar to that in Fig.
13 at a frequency modulus ω
1.3ωp. The phase speeds of these sideband modes
are presumably just above c. We ﬁnd a growing second mode at k = ku/2 at the
frequency modulus ω

0.8ωp,1 which moves at a superluminal phase speed.

≈

We observe the same growth of sideband modes for the fastest beam speed of
vb = 0.9c in Fig. 16. The sideband modes at k = ku have a frequency modulus
ω
1.2ωp,1 and phase speeds just above c. As for vb = 0.8c the sideband mode at
k = ku/2 has a frequency of ω

0.8ωp,1 and thus a superluminal phase speed.

≈

For both beam speeds vb = 0.8c and vb = 0.9c the sideband modes appear to
have a superluminal phase speed and they can therefore not trap electrons. No
secondary BGK modes should develop for these beam speeds. This is conﬁrmed by
Fig. 17 where we show the phase space distribution of the electrons for vb = 0.9c
at the simulation’s end. The phase space distribution at high momenta shows no
evidence of a BGK mode despite the strong sideband modes in Fig. 16.

≈

≈

In contrast to the PIC simulations in Dieckmann et al. ([2004a]) the Vlasov
simulation code shows the growth of sideband modes and what appears to be waves
resulting from a parametric instability. These secondary waves grow to a large am-
plitude at which they can nonlinearly interact with the electrons. For the beam
speeds up to vb = 0.4c the waves generated by the parametric interaction have
been strongest. Here the turbulent wave ﬁelds interact with the waves with ωp,1
to produce a wave with a higher frequency. In contrast to plasma beat wave ac-
celerators, which have recently been reviewed by Bingham, Mendonca & Shukla

power spectrum of kc = ku and (b) shows the frequency power spectrum of kc = ku/2 as

Fig. 17: Contour plot of log(fe > 10−6) for vb = 0.9c at the time t = 4000: No well-deﬁned
BGK mode is visible in the electron distribution since the sideband unstable modes have
a superluminal phase speed.

([2004]), for which two high-frequency electromagnetic waves beat to yield a low
frequency ESW that can accelerate the electrons, our parametric coupling couples
low frequency ESWs to an ESW with a higher frequency. Its larger phase speed
can accelerate the trapped electrons to higher peak speeds. We may thus call it the
“inverse plasma beat wave accelerator”. For a beam speed of vb = 0.6c the turbulent
wave ﬁelds do not noticably interact with ωp,1. Instead a sideband unstable mode
with k = ku develops, i.e. at the largest allowed wave number for nonrelativistic
0.6c a phase speed below
BGK modes (Krasovsky [1994]). This mode has for vb ≤
c and the electron phase space distribution shows a fast BGK mode driven by it.
For even higher vb the probably superluminal phase speed of the sideband modes
suppresses their interaction with the electrons.

The complex spectrum of secondary waves and their nonlinear interactions with
the electrons, which has not been observed clearly by Dieckmann et al. ([2004a]),
suggests a stronger dependence of the electron heating on vb than for the simulations
by Dieckmann et al. ([2004a]). There the momentum distributions could be matched
if one were to scale the momentum axis to vbγ(vb). We thus do the same here and
we integrate the electron phase space distribution over x. The result is shown in
Fig. 18.

We ﬁnd that the ﬁnal momentum distributions in the chosen normalization of
the p-axis agree well up to vb = 0.6c and for densities larger than 10−2. Here the
Vlasov code results are similar to the equivalent PIC simulations in Dieckmann et
al. ([2004a]). We ﬁnd, however, signiﬁcant diﬀerences at lower densities, which are
not well-represented by the PIC code, and at the corresponding higher momenta.
The parametric instabilites and the sideband instabilities have further accelerated
electrons beyond the peak momenta measured in Dieckmann et al. ([2004a]). This
is particularly pronounced for the beam speed vb = 0.6 in which we ﬁnd an electron
density plateau extending to a value of +10 for the normalised momentum, i. e.

Fig. 18: The electron momentum distributions at the simulation’s end times:

twice as high as the corresponding value at negative momenta. For these beam
speeds the secondary waves have been most eﬃcient as electron accelerators. A
further increase of vb beyond 0.6c yields broadening momentum distributions. The
peak momentum in units of mec is, for positive momenta comparable for vb = 0.6c
and for vb = 0.8c. The peak momentum for vb = 0.9c is about twice as high as for
vb = 0.6c.

4 Discussion

The observation of the emission of highly energetic cosmic ray particles by SNRs
suggests the acceleration of particles from the thermal pool of the ISM plasma
to highly relativistic energies by such objects. The acceleration site is apparently
linked to the shock that develops as the supernova blast shell encounters the ambient
plasma (Lazendic [2004]). Such shocks are believed to accelerate electrons and ions
to highly relativistic energies by means of Fermi acceleration (Fermi [1949]; Fermi
[1954]). The Fermi acceleration of electrons is most eﬃcient if the shock is quasi-
perpendicular (Galeev [1984]). For such shocks, however, Fermi acceleration works
only if we ﬁnd a relativistically hot electron population prior to the shock encounter,
since slow electrons could not repeatedly cross the shock and pick up energy. Since
the plasma, into which the SNR shock expands, has a thermal speed comparable
to that of the ISM or the stellar wind of the progenitor star with temperatures
of up to a few eV, if we take the solar wind as reference, no mildly relativistic
electrons may exist. A mechanism is thus required that accelerates electrons up to

speeds at which their Larmor radius exceeds the shock thickness. As Galeev ([1984])
proposed, electrons could be pre-accelerated from the initial thermal pool to mildly
relativistic energies by their interaction with strong ESWs in the foreshock region
which, in turn, are driven by shock-reﬂected beams of ions.

We have examined in this work the growth, saturation and collapse of ESWs
in a system dominated by the presence of two counter-propagating proton beams.
The currents of both beams cancel, allowing the introduction of periodic boundary
conditions. These initial conditions can be motivated as follows: The upstream
protons, that have initially been reﬂected by the shock, are rotated by the global
magnetic ﬁeld oriented perpendicularly to the shock normal and return as a second
counter propagating proton beam, with a slightly increased temperature. The sys-
tem modelled in this work represents a small region ahead of a SNR shock. Here
the magnetic ﬁeld has been neglected in order to focus on the ESWs and nonlin-
ear BGK modes. While this does not describe a complete model for the foreshock
dynamics of high Mach number shocks, it is applicable to parts of the foreshock
of perpendicular shocks where local variations magnetic ﬁeld cause it to vanish, or
become beam-aligned. These variations may, for example, be due to the presence
of turbulent magnetic ﬁeld structures in the foreshock of SNR shocks (Jun & Jones
[1999]; Lazendic et al. [2004]).

The system is unstable to the relativistic Buneman instability (Thode & Sudan
[1973]) which saturates via the trapping of electrons to form BGK modes (Rosen-
zweig [1988]). These trapped particle distributions are themselves unstable to the
sideband instability and collapse after a period of stability.

Since our model assumes that the particle trajectories are not aﬀected by the
local magnetic ﬁeld and because we do not consider here electromagnetic waves or
waves in magnetised plasma, we are able to utilise a relativistic, electrostatic Vlasov
code. Previous work, for example (Thode & Sudan [1973]; Dieckmann et al. [2000];
Dieckmann et al. [2004b]; Shimada & Hoshino [2004]) has made extensive use of PIC
codes for this problem and in particular Dieckmann et al. ([2004b]) have compared
Vlasov and PIC codes in certain conditions. We beneﬁt from the Eulerian Vlasov
code’s ability to resolve electron and ion phase space accurately, irrespective of the
local particle density. This allows us to identify a secondary acceleration mechanism
which may not be immediately apparent otherwise. Overall the results of this work
are in agreement with previous studies (Dieckmann et al. [2000]; Dieckmann et al.
[2004b]) showing the lifetimes of the BGK modes to be dependent on the initial beam
velocity. As vb is increased, we observe a reduced ESW stability up to vb = 0.8c but
with a signiﬁcantly increased stability at the highest beam speed.

At low beam velocities (vb = 0.15c, 0.2c, 0.4c, 0.6c) we observe long wavelength,
high phase-velocity modes. These are able to trap electrons, producing a population
with kinetic energies above the injection energy for Fermi acceleration, even at non-
relativistic beam, and thus shock, velocities. We believe these secondary (that is to
say, not associated with the initial ESW saturation) trapped distributions to be the
result of trapping in ESWs produced by parametric coupling between low frequency
oscillations and plasma waves at ωp,1. Above vb = 0.6c the ESWs produced by
this coupling have super-luminal phase velocities and are unable to trap electrons.
Hence we do not observe such BGK modes in the case of vb = 0.8c, or 0.9c. Our
simulation box, at 4π/ku in length, can only accommodate one wavemode with
wavenumber below that of the most unstable mode and this may have an inﬂuence
on the appearance of this secondary acceleration.

Future work has to examine how these parametric instabilities depend on a

×

magnetic ﬁeld and on the introduction of a second spatial dimension. We will need
to consider signiﬁcantly larger simulation boxes, capable of resolving a broader
spectrum below ku. It may be the case that the availability of modes with k < ku
will result in the partition of ESW energy across a greater region of the spectrum,
perhaps inhibiting the trapping of electrons at high velocity. However, it may be the
case that our observed coupling and resultant electron trapping is the ﬁrst step of a
cascade, capable of accelerating electrons to high energies for relatively modest shock
velocities. This is since, even for vb as low as 0.15c or corresponding shock speeds of
10−2c which can be reached by the fastest SNR main shocks (Kulkarni et al.
7.5
[1998]), electrons can reach energies of 105 eV. According to Treumann & Terasawa
([2001]), this may increase the electron gyroradius beyond the shock thickness by
which they can repeatedly cross the shock front. These repeated shock crossings
allow the electrons to undergo Fermi acceleration to highly relativistic speeds. Even
higher energies could be achieved if we were to get shock precursors that outran the
main shock as has been observed for the supernova SN1998bw (Kulkarni et al.
[1998]). The numerical simulations in this work thus present strong evidence for
the ability of ESWs and processes driven by electrostatic turbulence to accelerate
electrons beyond the threshold energy at which they can undergo Fermi acceleration
as it has previously been proposed, for example by Galeev ([1984]).

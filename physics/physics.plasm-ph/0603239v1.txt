An exact analytic solution is obtained for a uniformly expanding, neutral, inﬁnitely con-

ducting plasma sphere in an external dipole magnetic ﬁeld. The electrodynamical aspects

related to the radiation and transformation of energy were considered as well. The results

obtained can be used in analyzing the recent experimental and simulation data.

INTRODUCTION

Many processes in physics involve boundary surfaces which requires the solution of boundary

and initial value problems. The introduction of a moving boundary into the physics usually pre-

cludes the achievement of an exact analytic solution of the problem and recourse to approximation

methods is required [1, 2] (see also [3] and references therein). In the case of a moving plane bound-

ary a time-dependent translation of the embedding space immobilizes the boundary at the expense

of the increased complexity of the diﬀerential equation. It is the aim of this work to present an

example of a soluble moving boundary and initial value problem in spherical geometry.

The problems with moving boundary arise in many area of physics. One important example

is sudden expansion of hot plasma with a sharp boundary in an external magnetic ﬁeld which

is particularly of interest for many astrophysical and laboratory applications (see, e.g., [4] and

references therein). Such kind of processes arise during the dynamics of solar ﬂares and ﬂow of the

solar wind around the earth’s magnetosphere, in active experiments with plasma clouds in space,

and in the course of interpreting a number of astrophysical observations [3-9]. Researches on this

problem are of considerable interest in connection with experiments on controlled thermonuclear

fusion [11] (a recent review [4] summarizes research in this area over the past four decades).

To study the radial dynamics and evolution of the initially spherical plasma cloud both analytical

and numerical approaches were developed (see, e.g., [3-9] and references therein). The plasma

cloud is shielded from the penetration of the external magnetic ﬁeld by means of surface currents

circulating inside the thin layer on the plasma boundary. Ponderomotive forces resulting from

interaction of these currents with the magnetic ﬁeld would act on the plasma surface as if there

were magnetic pressure applied from outside. After some period of accelerated motion, plasma

gets decelerated as a result of this external magnetic pressure acting inward. The plasma has

been considered as a highly conducting matter with zero magnetic ﬁeld inside. From the point of

view of electrodynamics it is similar to the expansion of a superconducting sphere in a magnetic

ﬁeld. An exact analytic solution for a uniformly expanding, superconducting plasma sphere in an

external uniform and constant magnetic ﬁeld has been obtained in [12]. The nonrelativistic limit

of this theory has been used by Raizer [13] to analyze the energy balance (energy radiation and

transformation) during the plasma expansion. The similar problem has been considered in [8] for a

plasma layer. In the present paper we study the uniform expansion of the superconducting plasma

sphere in the presence of a dipole magnetic ﬁeld. For this geometry we found an exact analytical

solution which can be used in analyzing the recent experimental and simulation data (see [10] and

references therein).

II. MAGNETOSTATIC TREATMENT

In this section we ﬁrst consider the simpler example of a non-relativistic expansion of the plasma

sphere (v ≪ c, where v is the radial velocity of the sphere) in the presence of a dipole magnetic

ﬁeld. Consider the magnetic dipole p and a superconducting sphere with radius R located at the

origin of the coordinate system. The dipole is placed in the position r0 from the center of sphere

(R < r0). The orientation of the dipole is given by the angle θp between the vectors p and r0.

Here it is convenient to introduce the scalar magnetic potential ψ0 (r) of the dipole magnetic ﬁeld

which is given by

The dipole magnetic ﬁeld is then calculated as H0 (r) = −∇ψ0 (r),

ψ0 (r) =

p · (r − r0)
|r − r0|3 .

(cid:21)

When the superconducting sphere is introduced into a background magnetic ﬁeld the plasma

expands and excludes the background magnetic ﬁeld to form a magnetic cavity. The magnetic

We turn now to solve the boundary problem and calculate the induced magnetic ﬁeld which

arises near surface of the sphere due to the dipole magnetic ﬁeld. Since the sphere is superconduct-

ing the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes inside the sphere. In addition the normal component of the ﬁeld Hr

vanishes on the surface of the sphere. To solve the boundary problem we introduce the spherical

coordinate system with the z-axis along the vector r0 and the azimuthal angle φ is counted from

the plane (xz-plane) containing the vectors r0 and p. Hence, using the expressions (A2)-(A4) the

scalar potential (1) at r < r0 can alternatively be represented by the sum of Legendre polynomials

(see the Appendix A for details)

The total magnetic ﬁeld which is a sum of H0 (r) and the induced magnetic ﬁeld is obtained from

equation ∇ · H = 0. Introducing the scalar potential, H (r) = −∇ψ (r), the last equation becomes

∇2ψ (r) = 0, i.e., ψ (r) satisﬁes the Laplace equation. We must solve this equation with H = 0 at

r < R and boundary condition

r > R can be written as

The term ψQD (r) in equation (10) can be interpreted as a magnetic ﬁeld of point-like quadrupole

with the ”quadrupole moment” Dαβ (r) and located in the xz-plane inside the sphere at the distance
r∗ (r∗ = ξR < R) from the centre. At large distances this term behaves as ψQD (r) ≃ xzDxz/r5
with the quadrupole moment Dxz = r0

radial velocity is small, v/c ≪ 1, the amplitude of electric ﬁeld is small as well (of the order of

dipole orientation in the space.

(i) The case θp = 0; π. In this case the magnetic dipole is parallel or antiparallel to the vector

r0. Obviously due to the symmetry reason the magnetic ﬁeld does not depend on φ and Hφ = 0.

The magnetic ﬁeld component Hθ = − (1/r) (∂ψ/∂θ) induces the surface current on the sphere.

The ponderomotive forces resulting from interaction of this current with the magnetic ﬁeld acts on

the sphere surface with a magnetic pressure which can be calculated as an energy density of the

magnetic ﬁeld

The value of θmax tends to zero when the dipole comes close to the sphere and shifts toward the

larger values, θmax ≃ π/2, when the dipole goes to the inﬁnity. Therefore the layer near θ ≃ θmax

of the expanding sphere will be mainly deformed by the external magnetic pressure. This behavior

is clearly seen in the particle-in-cell simulation [14].

This force behaves as Fk ∼ l−s with s = 6 and s = 4 at large and small distances between the

dipole and the surface of sphere, respectively.

(ii) The case θp = π/2. In this case there are two components of the surface currents which are

proportional to Hθ and Hφ at r = R. The magnetic pressure is then given by

At large distances, ξ ≪ 1, the magnetic pressure is maximum at φ ≃ π

(in equatorial

plane), and θ = 0, π. At small distances, 1 − ξ ≪ 1, only the region of sphere with θ ∼ 1 − ξ ∼ 0

will be strongly deformed.

Again as for θp = 0, π the force F⊥ behaves as F⊥ ∼ l−s with s = 6 and s = 4 at large and small

distances, respectively. However, comparing equations (15) and (19) we conclude that the total

magnetic force at θp = π/2 is smaller than for parallel or antiparallel orientation of the dipole. For

instance, from equations (15) and (19) we obtain Fk ≃ 4F⊥ and Fk ≃ 2F⊥ at ξ ≪ 1 and ξ ∼ 1,

respectively.

III. ELECTRODYNAMIC TREATMENT

In this section we consider the moving boundary problem of the plasma sphere expansion in

the vacuum. In this sense unlike the magnetostatic problem considered above it is convenient here

to introduce the vector potential of the induced and dipole magnetic ﬁelds. Consider a spherical

region of space containing a neutral inﬁnitely conducting plasma which has expanded at t = 0 to

its present state from a point source located at the point r = 0. The external space at the point r0

contains a magnetic dipole p. The magnetic ﬁeld of this dipole is given by H0 = ∇ × A0, where

the vector potential A0 is

A0 =

p × (r − r0)
|r − r0|3

.

(20)

As the spherical plasma cloud expands it both perturbs the external magnetic ﬁeld and generates

an electric ﬁeld. Within the spherical plasma region there is neither an electric ﬁeld nor a magnetic

ﬁeld. We shall obtain an analytic solution of the electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration.

We consider practically interesting case when the vectors p and r0 are parallel (or antiparallel).

The general solution for the arbitrary orientation of p will be considered in a separate paper.

Within this geometry the problem is symmetric with respect to the axis r0 which is chosen as the

axial axis of the spherical coordinate system. Then there is only one nonvanishing component of

A0, A0r = A0θ = 0, and

Since the external region is devoid of free charge density, a suitable gauge allows the electric and

magnetic ﬁelds to be derived from the vector potential A. Having in mind the symmetry of the

original dipole magnetic ﬁeld it is suﬃcient to choose the vector potential in the form Ar = Aθ = 0,

The ﬁrst initial condition states that the initial value of Aϕ is that of a dipole magnetic ﬁeld. The

second initial condition states that there is no initial electric ﬁeld. Boundary conditions should be

imposed at the spherical surface r = R (t) and at inﬁnity. Because of the ﬁnite propagation velocity

of the perturbed electromagnetic ﬁeld the magnetic ﬁeld at inﬁnity will remain undisturbed for

all ﬁnite times. Further, no incoming wave-type solutions are permitted. Thus, for all ﬁnite times

Al (r, t) → 0 at r → ∞. The boundary condition at the expanding spherical surface is Hr = 0

which can be replaced by Aϕ (R (t) , θ, t) = 0 or, alternatively,

Since the sphere moves with a radial velocity v less than the velocity of light c, we have R < ct

or t − R (t) /c > 0. Thus, the contour in the integral of equation (32) should be closed by an inﬁnite

semicircle in the lower half plane and the integral evaluated by the method of residues.

Explicit evaluation of this integral equation (32), may be accomplished in the special case of a

uniform expansion. Choosing the simple model of constant radial velocity R (t) = vt and assuming

that R (t) < r0 equation (32) yields (see Appendix B for details)

written in the form at vt < r < ct

The electromagnetic ﬁeld components can be evaluated according to equation (23). From equa-

tions (23) and (34) it can be easily checked that the boundary condition on the moving surface,

E (R) = − 1

c [v × H (R)] (or Eϕ (R) = −βHθ (R)), is satisﬁed automatically. It may also be noted
that this special case of the uniform expansion falls within the conical ﬂow techniques, as indicated

in [12] for the case of uniform magnetic ﬁeld. From symmetry considerations one seeks a solution of

the form Al (r, t) = rνΦ (r/ct). Substitution into the diﬀerential equation (24) yields an explicitly

solvable ordinary diﬀerential equation whose solution, upon application of the boundary conditions

(Φ (1) = 0, Φ (β) = −p/rl+2

0

), is given by equation (34).

It should be noted that all above results are valid only for R(t) < r0 or t < r0/v. At the

time t = r0/v the dipole will enter into the plasma sphere and hence will be completely shielded

by the latter. Therefore at t ≥ r0/v the total electromagnetic ﬁeld vanishes and the radiation is

interrupted.

IV. ENERGY BALANCE

Previously signiﬁcant attention has been paid [8, 13] to the question of what fraction of energy

is emitted and lost in the form of electromagnetic pulse propagating outward of the expanding

plasma. In this section we consider the energy balance during the plasma sphere expansion in the

presence of the magnetic dipole. When the plasma sphere of the zero initial radius is created at

t = 0 and starts expanding, external magnetic ﬁeld H0 is perturbed by the electromagnetic pulse,

H′ (r, t) = H (r, t) − H0 (r), E (r, t), propagating outward with the speed of light. The tail of this

pulse coincides with the moving plasma boundary r = R (t) while the leading edge is at r = ct.

Ahead of the leading edge, the magnetic ﬁeld is not perturbed and equals H0 (r) while the electric

ﬁeld is zero.

Our starting point is the energy balance equation (Poynting equation)

∇ · S = −j · E −

(36)

where S = c

4π [E × H] is the Poynting vector and j = jϕeϕ (with |eϕ| = 1) is the azimuthal surface
current density. The energy radiated to inﬁnity is measured as a Poynting vector integrated over

time and over the surface Sc of the sphere with radius rc < r0 (control sphere) and the volume Ωc

enclosing the plasma sphere (rc > R or 0 6 t < rc/v). Integrating over time and over the volume

Ωc equation (36) can be represented as

WEM (0)−WEM (t) are the total electromagnetic energy and its change (with minus sign) in a volume

Ωc, respectively. WJ (t) is the energy transferred from plasma sphere to electromagnetic ﬁeld and

is the mechanical work with minus sign performed by the plasma on the external electromagnetic

pressure. At t = 0 the electromagnetic ﬁelds are given by H (r, t) = H0 (r) and E (r, t) = 0. Hence

WEM (0) is the energy of the dipole magnetic ﬁeld in a volume Ωc and can be calculated from

equation (3) by replacing R by rc and setting sin θp = 0,

In equation (40) Ω′

c is the volume of the control sphere excluding the volume of the plasma sphere

(we take into account that H (r, t) = E (r, t) = 0 in a plasma sphere). Hence the total energy ﬂux,

WS (t) given by equation (38) is calculated as a sum of the energy loss by plasma due to the external

electromagnetic pressure and the decrease of the electromagnetic energy in a control volume Ωc.

For non-relativistic (β ≪ 1) expansion of a one-dimensional plasma slab and for uniform external

magnetic ﬁeld (H0 = const) WS ≃ 2WJ ≃ 2∆WEM, i.e., approximately the half of the outgoing

energy is gained from the plasma, while the other half is gained from the magnetic energy [8]. In the

case of non-relativistic expansion of highly-conducting spherical plasma in the uniform magnetic

ﬁeld the outgoing energy WS is distributed between WJ and ∆WEM according to WJ = 1.5Q0 and
0 R3/6 is the magnetic energy escaped from the
∆WEM = 0.5Q0 with WS = 2Q0, where Q0 = H 2
plasma volume [13]. Therefore in this case the released electromagnetic energy is mainly gained

from the plasma.

Consider now each energy component WS (t), WJ (t) and ∆WEM (t) separately. WS (t) is calcu-

lated from equation (38). In the ﬁrst expression of equation (38) the t′-integral must be performed

with κ = R2/r0rc. In equation (42) Q (κ) represents the magnetic energy of the dipole ﬁeld in a
sphere having the radius R∗ = R2/rc < R and enclosed in the plasma sphere.

Next, we calculate the energy loss WJ (t) by the plasma which is determined by the surface

current density, j. From the symmetry reason it is clear that this current has only azimuthal

component and is localized within thin spherical skin layer, R − δ < r < R + δ with δ → 0,

near plasma boundary. Therefore in equation (38) the volume Ωc can be replaced by the volume
Ωδ ∼ R2δ which includes the space between the spheres with r = R − δ and r = R + δ. The surface

current density is calculated from the Maxwell’s equation, j = (1/4π)

where γ−2 = 1 − β2 and SR are the relativistic factor and the surface of the expanding plasma,

respectively. Note that the moving boundary modiﬁes the surface current which is now proportional
to γ−2 [3]. In equation (43) the term with ∂E2(r,t)

has been transformed to the surface integral using

∂t

the fact that the boundary of the volume Ωδ moves with a constant velocity v and the electrical ﬁeld

has a jump across the plasma surface. Equation (43) shows that the energy loss by the plasma per

unit time is equal to the work performed by the plasma on the external electromagnetic pressure.

This external pressure is formed by the diﬀerence between magnetic and electric pressures, i.e.,

Comparing equations (41), (44) and (46) we conclude that ∆WEM (t)+WJ (t) = WS (t) as predicted

by the energy balance equation (37). The non-relativistic limit of equation (46) can be evaluated

from equations (42) and (45) using the relation ∆WEM (t) = WS (t) − WJ (t). As an example

in ﬁgure 1 we show the results of model calculations for the ratios ΓS (t) = WS (t) /Q0 (t) and

ΓJ (t) = WJ (t) /Q0 (t) as a function of time (rc/c 6 t < rc/v). Here Q0 (t) = Q (ξ) is the dipole

magnetic energy escaped from the plasma sphere. For the relativistic factor β we have chosen a

wide range of values. We recall that at 0 6 t 6 rc/c, i.e. the electromagnetic pulse does not yet

reach to the surface of the control sphere, WS (t) = 0. Unlike the case with uniform magnetic ﬁeld

discussed above (see also [8, 13]) there are no simple relations between the energy components

WS (t), WJ (t) and Q0 (t). However, at the initial stage (t ≪ rc/v) of non-relativistic expansion

the dipole ﬁeld at large distances can be treated as uniform and the energies WS (t) and WJ (t) are

close to the values 2Q0 (t) and 1.5Q0 (t) (see ﬁgure 1), respectively. For any β the ratio ΓJ (t) is

almost constant and may be approximated as ΓJ (t) ≃ ΓJ (0) or alternatively WJ (t) ≃ 1.5CQ0 (t),
where C = γ−6 (1 − β)−4 (1 + 2β)−2 is some kinematic factor. For β ∼ 1 this factor is very
large and behaves as C ≃ (8/9) (1 − β)−1 ≫ 1. As expected the total energy ﬂux, WS (t), increases

monotonically with t. At the ﬁnal stage (t = rc/v) of relativistic expansion (with β ∼ 1) WS ≃ WJ .

Hence in this case the radiated energy WS is mainly gained from the plasma sphere.

V. CONCLUSION

An exact solution of the uniform radial expansion of a neutral, inﬁnitely conducting plasma

sphere in the presence of a dipole magnetic ﬁeld has been obtained. The electromagnetic ﬁelds are

derived by using the appropriate boundary and initial conditions, equations (25) and (26). It is

shown that the electromagnetic ﬁelds are perturbed only within the domain extending from the

surface of the expanding plasma sphere r = R = vt to the surface of the expanding information

sphere r = ct. External to the sphere r = ct the magnetic ﬁeld is not perturbed and is given by

the dipole magnetic ﬁeld. In the course of this study we have also considered the energy balance

during the plasma sphere expansion. The model calculations show that the radiated energy is

mainly gained from the plasma sphere. For relativistic expansion the ratio WS/WJ is close to

unity and the radiated energy is practically gained only from plasma sphere.

We expect our theoretical ﬁndings to be useful in experimental investigations as well as in

numerical simulations of the plasma expansion into ambient nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld. One of the

improvements of our model will be to include the eﬀect of the deceleration of the plasma sphere as

well as the derivation of the dynamical equation for the surface deformation. A study of this and

other aspects will be reported elsewhere.

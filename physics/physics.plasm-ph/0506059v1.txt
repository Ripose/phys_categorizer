Energy-conserving Finite-β Electromagnetic Drift-ﬂuid Equations

Nonlinear energy-conserving drift-ﬂuid equations that are suitable to describe self-

consistent ﬁnite-β low-frequency electromagnetic (drift-Alfv´en) turbulent ﬂuctua-

tions in a nonuniform, anisotropic, magnetized plasma are derived from a variational

principle. The variational principle is based on a drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian that contains

linear and nonlinear E × B velocities derived directly from the corresponding single-

particle ﬁnite-β gyrocenter Hamiltonian (in the zero-Larmor-radius limit). Covariant

electromagnetic eﬀects introduce a magnetic generalization to the standard ion po-

larization density as well as introduce a new ion magnetization current, which are

both missing from existing gyroﬂuid and drift-ﬂuid Poisson-Amp`ere equations. An

exact energy conservation law is also derived directly from the drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian

by application of the Noether method.

INTRODUCTION

The derivation of dissipationless nonlinear reduced-ﬂuid equations that explicitly conserve

energy represents an important goal of the numerical simulation communities in fusion [1]-[8]

and space [9]-[10] plasma physics. The existence of an exact energy conservation law plays

an important role in benchmarking numerical investigations of energy-transfer processes in

a nonlinear plasma turbulent state between the ﬂuid kinetic energy, its internal energy, and

the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy. Hence, if and when dissipative eﬀects and/or advanced

ﬂuid-closure schemes are introduced in a nonlinear dissipationless reduced-ﬂuid model, one

can develop a deeper understanding of the roles played by dissipationless and dissipative

2

(3)

eﬀects on the long-time evolution of the turbulent plasma state.

The variational formulation of dissipationless ﬂuid dynamics ensures that the nonlinear

ﬂuid equations satisfy an exact energy conservation law derived by application of the Noether

method [11]-[13]. Previous variational formulations of reduced ﬂuid models include the drift-

ﬂuid work of Pﬁrsch and Correa-Restrepo [14, 15] and the recent gyroﬂuid works of Strintzi

and Scott [16] and Strintzi, Scott, and Brizard [17]. In contrast to Refs. [16, 17], however, we

ignore ﬁnite-Larmor-radius (FLR) eﬀects to focus our attention on the drift-ﬂuid polarization

and magnetization eﬀects introduced by the low-frequency magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations.

In the energy-conserving drift-Alfv´en model presented here, the perturbed electric and

magnetic ﬁelds

E ≡ − ∇φ −

and B⊥ ≡ ∇Ak ×

are expressed in terms of the ﬂuctuation scalar potentials φ and Ak, and the time-

where uE denotes the linear perturbed E ×B velocity and Vk denotes the parallel component

of the nonlinear perturbed E × B velocity. Lastly, according to the ﬁnite-β ordering [18]-

[20] (me/mi < β ≪ 1), we neglect the perpendicular component of the ﬂuctuating vector

potential (A⊥ ≡ 0), so that the parallel component of the ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld is

assumed to vanish in what follows.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the heuristic

derivation of the nonlinear drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian density to be used, in Sec. III, in the

variational derivation of our self-consistent, energy-conserving drift-Alfv´en equations.

In

Sec. IV, we use the Noether method to derive the local form of the energy conservation law

for our drift-Alfv´en model. Next, we integrate the local form of the energy conservation

law to obtain its global form, in which the energy-transfer processes between the parallel

kinetic energy, internal energy, and electromagnetic ﬁeld energy are manifestly expressed.

In Sec. V, we summarize our variational derivation of the energy-conserving drift-Alfv´en

model. Lastly, in Appendix A, we present a procedure developed for including heat ﬂuxes

3

within a ﬂuid Lagrangian variational principle, while in Appendix B, we brieﬂy outline the

diamagnetic-cancellation procedure involving the addition of energy-conserving gyroviscous

terms in the drift-ﬂuid equations for (uk, p⊥, pk).

II. DRIFT-FLUID LAGRANGIAN DENSITY

The four-moment drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian for the present anisotropic-temperature ﬁnite-β

electromagnetic model is based on the previous electrostatic gyroﬂuid work of Strintzi, Scott,

and Brizard [17]. Here, the drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian density (for a ﬂuid species of mass m and

charge e) is deﬁned as

and all terms (except the last one) are standard ﬂuid Lagrangian terms. The last term rep-

resents the zero-Larmor-radius (ZLR) limit of the electromagnetic nonlinearities contained

in the second-order ﬁnite-β gyrocenter Hamiltonian [21]:

where vk denotes the parallel gyrocenter particle velocity, the E × B velocities uE and Vk are

deﬁned in Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively, and the background magnetic-ﬁeld nonuniformity

was neglected. By heuristically transforming this second-order gyrocenter Hamiltonian to its

drift-ﬂuid version, following a procedure outlined in Refs. [14, 15], the drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian

density (5) for each ﬂuid species becomes

We point out that, while uk denotes the parallel drift-ﬂuid velocity along the unperturbed

(background) magnetic ﬁeld B0, Uk denotes the parallel drift-ﬂuid velocity along the total
magnetic ﬁeld B0 + B⊥. Moreover, although the term b2 − 1 is considered small, it is kept in

the drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian (5) to allow a covariant treatment of drift-ﬂuid polarization and

magnetization eﬀects in our model [see Eqs. (10)-(11) below].

We note that the ﬂuid velocity u appearing in the drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian density (5)

is deﬁned as the particle-ﬂuid velocity expressed in terms of moments of the gyroangle-

independent gyrocenter distribution function F (R, vk, µ, t) deﬁned in Ref. [22]:

ﬂuctuations) are omitted for simplicity. Furthermore, because of the presence of δ3(R+ρ−r)

in Eq. (8), the gyroﬂuid moment of the perpendicular particle velocity v⊥ does not vanish

but, instead, yields the divergenceless term

Because of the mass dependence in the drift-ﬂuid polarization and magnetization vectors

(10)-(11), the drift-ﬂuid polarization and magnetization eﬀects are especially important for

ion ﬂuid species (in a quasineutral plasma).

The total Lagrangian density for our four-moment electromagnetic drift-ﬂuid model is,

therefore, deﬁned as the sum of the Lagrangian density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the

drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian density (5) for each ﬂuid species (summation over species is implied):

energy (i.e., |E|2 → |E⊥|2), which removes the parallel displacement current (∂tEk) in the

parallel drift-ﬂuid Amp`ere equation [see Eq. (36)]. The variational ﬁelds are the four drift-

ﬂuid moments (n, u, p⊥, pk) for each ﬂuid species and the electromagnetic potentials (φ, Ak).

Here, we note that only the ﬁrst four drift-ﬂuid moments (n, u, p⊥, pk) appear in the drift-

ﬂuid Lagrangian density (5) and higher-order drift-ﬂuid moments (e.g., heat ﬂuxes) are

omitted as variational dynamical ﬁelds; future work will consider the introduction of higher-

order drift-ﬂuid moments in a Lagrangian variational setting [25] (see Appendix A for further

comments). Lastly, we note that, because the background magnetic ﬁeld B0 is independent
of the variational ﬁelds, the magnetic-energy term − |B0|2/8π has been removed from the

Lagrangian density (12).

where the additional x-dependence in  L(· · · ; x) arises from the nonuniform background

magnetic ﬁeld B0. Here, the Eulerian variations for the drift-ﬂuid moments (δn, δu, δp⊥, δpk)

are not independent of each other but are instead expressed in terms of a virtual ﬂuid

displacement ξ (for each ﬂuid species).

The derivation of the Eulerian variations (δn, δp⊥, δpk) are based on dynamical constraints
for the drift-ﬂuid moments ηa = (n, p⊥, pk). The ﬁrst dynamical constraint is associated with

mass conservation, expressed in terms of the continuity equation

dn

+ n ∇ · u = 0,

where d/dt = ∂/∂t + u · ∇ denotes the total time derivative. The next two dynamical

constraints are associated with the conservation of the ﬁrst two single-particle adiabatic

invariants, expressed in terms of the Chew-Goldberger-Low equations for the perpendicular

and parallel pressures [24]:

where the higher-order heat-ﬂux moments q(k)

⊥ and q(⊥)

later in Appendix B.

We begin our derivation of expressions for the Eulerian variations to be used in Eq. (14)

by transforming the dynamical constraints (15) and (16)-(17) into Lagrangian variations

where ξ denotes the virtual ﬂuid-displacement (for each ﬂuid species), with the Lagrangian

variation of the ﬂuid velocity is deﬁned as ∆u ≡ dξ/dt. Hence, using the procedure (18) on

7

the constraint equations (15)-(17), we ﬁnd the Lagrangian variations

The Euler-Poincar´e equation (25) can be divided into two equations: one equation that

The second equation to be extracted from the Euler-Poincar´e equation (25), which de-

scribes the time evolution equation for parallel drift-ﬂuid velocity uk, can be obtained by

which contains both the parallel inductive electric ﬁeld and the partial time derivative of the

parallel component of the nonlinear E × B velocity (3); note that the parallel component
b0 · ∂tuE ≡ 0). Note
of the partial time derivative of the linear E × B velocity vanishes (
also that, although the convective derivative u · ∇(muk b2) along the drift-ﬂuid velocity u
appears to be absent in Eq. (33), it is actually hidden in the last term − mn Uk b∗ · ∇Uk;

b

this term may appear explictly in Eq. (25) by redeﬁning the divergenceless vector (26) into

a non-divergenceless vector as was done in Ref. [17].

The set of drift-ﬂuid equations of motion for the four drift-ﬂuid moments (n, uk, p⊥, pk)

are, thus, given by Eqs. (15),(33), and (16)-(17), respectively, while the drift-ﬂuid velocity u

is deﬁned by Eq. (29). Note that each of the drift-ﬂuid equations for (uk, p⊥, pk) involves the
diamagnetic advection operator uD · ∇, which must be cancelled by the addition of so-called

gyroviscous cancellations (see Appendix B for further details). Furthermore, the drift-ﬂuid

moment equations now need to be complemented by suitable evolution equations for the

electromagnetic scalar potentials (φ, Ak) through the low-frequency version of Maxwell’s

equations, in which the net charge and current densities are expressed in terms of drift-ﬂuid

charge and current densities as well as polarization and magnetization terms.

C. Poisson and parallel Amp`ere equations

We now derive the drift-ﬂuid Poisson and parallel Amp`ere equations from the variational

drift-ﬂuid polarization current Jpol ≡ ∂P⊥/∂t has no parallel component (

thus, it does not appear in the parallel drift-ﬂuid Amp`ere equation (36).

b

Lastly, we note that the covariant electromagnetic polarization and magnetization eﬀects

in the drift-ﬂuid Poisson-Amp`ere equations are due to (a) the φ−Ak symmetry of the nonlin-

ear Lagrangian term mnuk Vk in the drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian (5), and (b) the nonlinear kinetic

eﬀects appear naturally in nonlinear ﬁnite-β gyrokinetic theory [21], they have not appeared

explicitly in previous derivations of gyroﬂuid equations (e.g., Ref. [23]).

D. Quasineutral drift-ﬂuid dynamics

A fundamental aspect of drift-ﬂuid dynamics in a strongly magnetized plasma involves

the fact that the time evolution of the turbulent plasma state maintains a condition of
quasineutrality [29], where ρ = ∇ · E⊥/4π ≡ 0 and, thus, according to the drift-ﬂuid Poisson

equation (35), the net drift-ﬂuid charge density [14]

en ≡ ∇ · P⊥

X

is expressed in terms of the drift-ﬂuid polarization vector (10). This drift-ﬂuid quasineutral-

ity condition, therefore, can be used with Eq. (35) to obtain the drift-ﬂuid charge conserva-

Lastly, we note that, while the standard polarization drift velocity (32) is absent from

the drift-ﬂuid velocity (29), the associated drift-ﬂuid polarization current density ∂tP⊥ is

introduced naturally into our formalism through the drift-ﬂuid quasineutrality condition

(37) and the drift-ﬂuid charge conservation law (38). Furthermore, we note that the drift-

ﬂuid polarization vector (10) can be expressed as P⊥ ≡

IV. LOCAL AND GLOBAL DRIFT-FLUID ENERGY CONSERVATION LAWS

In this Section, we present the local and global forms of the energy conservation law, as

they arise from an application of the Noether method [11]-[13]. For this purpose, we point

out that, as a result of the variational principle

δ L d3x dt = 0, the only remaining terms in

the Eulerian variation of the Lagrangian density (20) yield the Noether equation

R

δ L =

+ ∇ · Γ,

∂Λ
∂t

(42)

where the Noether ﬁelds Λ and Γ are deﬁned in Eqs. (22)-(23). The energy and momentum

conservation laws are derived from the Noether equation (42) by considering inﬁnitesimal

time and space translations [14], respectively. In the present work, we focus our attention

on the local and global energy conservation laws associated with our drift-Alfv´en model.

A. Local energy conservation law

We derive the local form of the energy conservation law from the Noether equation (42)

by considering inﬁnitesimal time translations t → t + δt, from which we obtain the following

expressions for the virtual ﬂuid displacement ξ and the Eulerian variations δφ and δ L:

ξ = − u δt and (δφ, δAk, δ L) = − δt

where D is an arbitrary vector ﬁeld.

In order to arrive at the ﬁnal form of the local energy conservation law, we need to

rearrange some terms in Eq. (47). First, by substituting the drift-ﬂuid Poisson equation

(35), we ﬁnd

in which diamagnetic-cancellation terms result in a heat-modiﬁed energy density ﬂux S∗ [see

We now present the time evolution of each energy component (in the absence of diamag-

netic cancellations and heat ﬂuxes) in order to identify the energy-exchange processes that

allow the transfer of energy between the three types of drift-ﬂuid (parallel kinetic, internal,

electromagnetic ﬁeld) energies.

the parallel kinetic energy Eu, internal energy Ep, and electromagnetic ﬁeld energy Eψ involve

the following pathways:

(p⊥, pk) ↔ (n, uk) ↔ (φ, Ak),

(73)

where Eqs. (64) and (66), for example, show that internal energy Ep is transferred to and

from parallel kinetic energy Eu.

V. SUMMARY

The nonlinear drift-Alfv´en equations (15), (33), and (16)-(17) for the anisotropic drift-

ﬂuid moments (n, uk, p⊥, pk), respectively, and the drift-ﬂuid Poisson-Amp`ere equations (35)

and (36) were derived in this paper from a Lagrangian variational principle based on the drift-

ﬂuid Lagrangian density (12). The local and global forms of the exact energy conservation

law for these drift-Alfv´en equations, given by Eqs. (53) and (58), respectively, were derived

by the Noether method as a natural consequence of the variational formulation presented

here.

The inclusion of the linear and nonlinear E × B velocities (2)-(3) as well as the parallel

ﬂow along the total magnetic ﬁeld lines into the drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian density (12) enabled a

derivation of generalized (electromagnetic) drift-ﬂuid polarization and magnetization eﬀects.

Under the drift-ﬂuid quasineutrality condition, the drift-ﬂuid Poisson-Amp`ere equations (35)

and (36) were transformed into the drift-ﬂuid charge conservation law (38), with the net

current density J deﬁned by Eq. (41), which represents a generalized (electromagnetic) form

of the so-called vorticity equation.

Although higher-order drift-ﬂuid moments have been omitted from the present variational

formulation of our four-moment nonlinear anisotropic drift-Alfv´en model, Appendix A shows

how higher-order heat ﬂuxes might be introduced into a variational formulation, while Ap-

pendix B shows how diamagnetic cancellations in the drift-ﬂuid equations for (uk, p⊥, pk)

19

can be incorporated without aﬀected the global energy conservation law. Future work will

investigate the extension of variational principles by including higher-order heat ﬂuxes as

dynamical variational ﬁelds as well as the extension of Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM)

methods [30] to plasma ﬂuid models.

APPENDIX A: NOTES ON MACROSCOPIC PLASMA LAGRANGIANS

In this Appendix, we present an adapted version of Y.-K. M. Peng’s Ph. D. dissertation

[31] (with selected parts also published in Ref. [32]). The macroscopic Lagrangian presented

by Peng is based on constrained variations of the ﬂuid density, velocity, and pressure tensor,

and includes the eﬀects of ﬁnite heat ﬂuxes self-consistently.

1. Lagrangian Density in Eulerian Coordinates

Following Peng’s work, we begin by combining the pressure constraint equations (16)-(17)

to form the scalar pressure equation for P ≡ p⊥ + pk/2:

dP
dt

+ P ∇ · u + P : ∇u = − ∇ · q,

(A1)

where the heat ﬂux q now appears on the right side of Eq. (A1). Next, the heat ﬂux vector

q is represented as

∂Q
∂t
where Q denotes the total density of heat energy transported across the boundary of the

+ u · ∇Q,

dQ
dt

q ≡

(A2)

=

macroscopic (coarse-graining) cell as it moves along its Lagrangian trajectory [31, 32]. Hence,

the right side of Eq. (A1) can be written as
− ∇ · q ≡ − ∇ · dQ
dt

= −

− ∇u : ∇Q,

d∇ · Q
dt

so that Eq. (A1) may be rewritten as

d
dt

(P + ∇ · Q) = − P ∇ · u − (P + ∇Q) : ∇u.

(A3)

By using the Lagrangian-variation limitting procedure (18), we, thus, obtain the Lagrangian

variation

∆ (P + ∇ · Q) = − P ∇ · ξ − (P + ∇Q) : ∇ξ,

from which we obtain the Eulerian variation

δ (P + ∇ · Q) = − ∇ · (P ξ + ξ · ∇Q) − P : ∇ξ.

Lastly, the heat ﬂux q is introduced in the Lagrangian density  L, deﬁned by Eq. (12), by
adding the divergence term − ∇ · Q:

 L′ ≡  L − ∇ · Q ≡  Lcold − (P + ∇ · Q) ,

where  Lcold denotes the cold-ﬂuid part of the drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian density (12).

20

(A4)

(A5)

(A6)

2. Eulerian Variational Principle

We now write the expression for the Eulerian variation of the heat-modiﬁed Lagrangian

density (A6):

δ L′ = δ Lcold + ∇ · (P ξ + ξ · ∇Q) + P : ∇ξ ≡ δ L + ∇ · (ξ · ∇Q) ,

(A7)

where the Eulerian variation δ L is given by the Noether equation (42). We note that the

quantity Q does not play a dynamic role since it appears inside a spatial divergence. We

shall see, however, that it plays an important role in terms of the energy conservation law

derived from the heat-modiﬁed Noether equation

δ L′ =

+ ∇ · (Γ + ξ · ∇Q) .

(A8)

∂Λ
∂t

3. Energy Conservation Law by Noether Method

The invariance of the Lagrangian density (A6) under time translations t → t+δt yields an

energy equation derived from the Noether equation (A8). By applying the Noether method

(as outlined in Sec. IV), we obtain the heat-modiﬁed energy equation:

0 =

(ε + ∇ · Q) + ∇ · (S + u · ∇Q) ≡

+ ∇ ·

S +

(A9)

∂ε
∂t

dQ
dt !

,

 

∂
∂t

where the energy density ε and energy-density ﬂux S are deﬁned in Eqs. (52) and (55),

respectively. Lastly, using the deﬁnition (A2) for the heat ﬂux q, we obtain the energy

equation

∂ε
∂t

+ ∇ · S = − ∇ · q.

Although the heat ﬂux q appears self-consistently within Peng’s variational principle, we

note that the evolution equation for q is outside of its scope. It is a topic of future research

to determine whether the evolution equation for the heat ﬂux can be derived within a

variational formulation.

APPENDIX B: DIAMAGNETIC CANCELATIONS AND ENERGY

CONSERVATION

The drift-ﬂuid equations (33) and (16)-(17) contain diamagnetic advective derivatives
uD · ∇ηa of the drift-ﬂuid moments ηa = (uk, p⊥, pk) that must be cancelled by the addition

of so-called higher-order gyroviscous cancellations. Since these higher-order moments cannot

be derived from the drift-ﬂuid Lagrangian, the diamagnetic cancelations must be inserted

in drift-ﬂuid equations in the post-variational phase. However, there exists a constraint in

the addition of higher-order moment terms, namely, that the global energy conservation law

should not be altered.

1. Parallel drift-ﬂuid dynamics

The diamagnetic cancelation needed for the parallel momentum equation (33) involves

the addition of the term − ∇ · Π∗

k on the right side of Eq. (33), associated with the non-

diagonal part of the pressure tensor. From Vlasov theory, the diamagnetic-cancelation term

is found to be [33, 34, 35]:

To consider the diamagnetic cancellations in the anisotropic pressure equations (16)-(17),

we write the modiﬁed CGL pressure equations [27]:

Inserting these diamagnetic heat ﬂuxes into Eqs. (B4)-(B5), the time evolution of the internal

energy can, therefore, be expressed as

= − ∇ · (P u + P · u + q) + u · (∇ · P) ,

(B7)

where the net heat ﬂux is q ≡ q(k)

⊥ . Hence, we see that the insertion of diamagnetic
cancellations into our ﬁnite-β electromagnetic drift-ﬂuid model does not jeopardize the local

⊥ + q(⊥)

and global energy conservation laws, where the energy density ﬂux (55) is now replaced by

the ﬂux

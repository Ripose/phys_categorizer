Abstract — The paper consider a complex dynam-
ics of electron beam with virtual cathode and local
neutralization of the beam charge density near an-
ode. Diﬀerent types of nonlinear behaviour, includ-
ing deterministic chaos, were treated. It is shown
that chaotic dynamics arises as results of spatiotem-
poral structures interaction.

Introduction and model

In the present paper we consider a electrostatic short-
circuited diode model. The immobile ion background
with concentration np locates near left boundary (an-
ode plasma). The electron beam with overcritical cur-
rent injected into diode with nonpurtubated velocity
v0 and charge density ρ0. In this case virtual cathode
(VC) forms in the beam as a result of the electrostatic
instability [1], and some beam part is reﬂected from
VC to injected boundary. VC oscillates in the diode
region. The electron beam with VC demonstrates wide
diversity of nonlinear phenomenons, including chaotic
behaviour [2], synchronization [3] and other. Investi-
gation of complex dynamics attracts many researchers,
that is, such behaviour is the characteristic property of
the beam with VC. That counts is study the structure
formation, since it is well known, that chaotic dynam-
ics in distributed systems is connected with pattern
formation (see [4] and references therein).

The such simplest model of device with VC as a pla-
nar diode with overcritical current describes a diﬀerent
nonlinear phenomenons in the real vircator systems.
Our model with local neutralisation is a simple model
of vircator with injected plasma [2].

The behaviour of system is determined by the di-

mensionless parameter related current

where ωp is the beam plasma frequency, L is the dis-
tance between diode planes and neutralisation param-
eter

α = ωpL/v0,

n = np/n0.

Hence n0 = ρ0/e and value of plasma region length xp
is constant (xp = 0.25L).

The eﬀect of neutralisation degree of anode plasma
on VC dynamics was investigated with the aid of
particle–in–cell simulation. The macroparticles in the
simulation obey the non-relativistic equations of mo-
tion

dx/dt = v,
dv/dt = −(q/m)∂φ/∂x,

where x is the position of particles, v is the velocity of
of the particles, q is the charge and m is the mass of
the macroparticles. The code integrates the equation of
motion forward in time using a leapfrog scheme. The
potential φ is computed by the Poisson’s equation in
one dimension
∂2φ(x)
∂x

= −α2(ρ(x) − ρp(x)).

Hence ρ(x) is the spatial distribution of beam charge
density and ρp(x) is the distribution of immobile ion
background. In our case

ρp(x) =

n · e, x ≤ xp,
x > xp.

System dynamics

The tentative analysis of nonlinear dynamics were eﬀec-
tuated from observation of time series of electric ﬁeld
oscillation in the injection plane. Power spectra and
projections of attractors were reconstructed from time
series. Based on this analysis, domains for distinct be-
haviour were isolated in parameter plane (α, n) (see
Fig. 1).

The VC oscillation (VCO) for small value of neutral-
isation is regular (domain marked A in the parameter
plane; Fig. 2(a)). Analysis of physical processes shows
that only one electron bunch (VC) is arisen in the sys-
tem. This bunch is marked on the spatiotemporal di-
agram (Fig.3(a)). Besides, metastable particles, which

librium

exist in the interaction space during of more than one
period of VCO, is observed in the beam. However,
charge density of the metastable bunch is small, and
it is little aﬀected by VCO. The weakly chaotic VCO
arises as neutralisation and current increase (domain B
for n < 2.0; Fig. 2(b)). In this case metastable bunch
density grows. The further increasing of n leads to
formation of profound metastable bunch in the beam
(Fig. 3(b)). A buildup of space charge density in VC
region entails the regime with large base frequency in
the VCO spectrum (compare Fig. 2(a,b) and Fig. 2(d),
that obtain for the same value of α = 2.125π). This
behaviour of system take place for n > 2.25 ÷ 2.5 (B;
Fig. 2(d)). A change-over from the weak chaos for
small values of n to the weak chaos for large n de-
rives through two domains of strongly chaotic VCO. In
the ﬁrst regime (domain C in Fig. 1) phase portrait is
homogeneous, there are not sharp peaks in the power
spectrum. The second regime (D) may be treated as
intermittence (Fig. 2(c)).

For large values of n (domain E) system demon-
strates highly non-regular oscillation with noise-like
spectrum and homogeneous attractors (Fig. 2(e)). In
this case VC is formed out of anode plasma region. VC
exists constantly and chaotic dynamics is determined
by the reﬂection of the particles from VC. Note, VC is
not moved in the space, but depth of potential barrier
is oscillated in time.

Dimensions of the reconstructed attractors was esti-
mated for diﬀerent types of chaotic behaviour. Fig. 4
presents correlation dimension of attractors D versus
value of embedded dimension m for strong chaos. Di-
mension is saturated for small values of m. Small values
of embedded dimensions justify appearance of chaotic
behaviour in the beam in the result of interaction be-
tween small numbers of structures.

Pattern formation

The spatiotemporal data of charge density ρ(x, t) were
analyzed by the Karhunen–Loeve orthogonal decom-
position [5]. This method decomposes a data set into
spatial orthogonal modes {ψ(x)}i. This modes is the
solution of the integral equation

R(x, x

)ψ(x

′
)dx

= Λψ(x),

Z

where R(x, x′) = hρ(x, t)ρ(x′, t)it is the mutual corre-
lation function. The value of eigenvalue Λi is propor-
tional to the energy of i-th mode. Karhunen–Loeve
method is optimal in the sense that one is optimized
(from the viewpoint of energy of modes) eigensets {Λ}i
and {ψ}i. The measure of energy of modes is

Wi =

.

The energy of several ﬁrst modes for diﬀerent values
of n is presented in Table for α = 1.35π. The typi-
cal spatial distributions of modes are shown in Fig. 5.
In the all regimes of VCO behaviour of beams is de-
termined by the small number of structures, because
more then 90% energy is contained in the 3 ÷ 4 higher
modes.

For small neutralisation ﬁrst modes demonstrates
strong nonuniform charge density distribution with one
peak (Fig. 5(a)), that corresponds of typical distribu-
tion of density in VC. Second mode describes are pro-
cesses of destruction of VC and disposal of particles
from VC to anode. Third and other modes correspond

leads to growth of second modes at the expense of
higher mode.

Metastable bunch is formed for values of n ∼ 2 ÷ 3.
In this case ﬁrst and second modes together describes

(a) n = 0.25

(b) n = 2.5

(c) n = 3.25

dynamics of VC and metastable bunch, besides cross-
correlation between dynamics modes A1(t) and A2(t)
is large. Hence temporal dynamics of modes is

Ai(t) =

ρ(x, t)ψi(x)dx.

Z

Spatial distribution of modes is strongly localizing
in the interaction space for regime E (Fig. 5(c)). Only
one structure — weakly oscillating in the space virtual
cathode — exists in the beam, and more than 80%
energy accumulated in the ﬁrst mode. Chaotic VCO is
determined by the reﬂection of the larger part of beam
from VC.

Conclusions

In the electron beam with VC and local neutralisation
diﬀerent types of nonlinear oscillation are recognized.
Inﬂuence of density of anode plasma on the chaotic
dynamics of VC are considered. Large neutralisation
degree leads to strong chaos in the VCO. Strange at-
tractor is most homogeneous in this case. Relationship
between diﬀerent type of chaotic behaviour and struc-
ture formation are shown with the help of analysis of
physical processes in the diode. The typical patterns
(VC and diﬀerent additional structures) were recog-
nized for regimes with small and large neutralisation.
It is shown that appearance of chaotic behaviour con-
nects with growth of charge density in the additional

structures.
Investigation of chaotic behaviour in our
model may be helpful for design of vircators with an-
ode plasma grid, because changing of density of anode
plasma lead to changing of radiation characteristics in
these devices.

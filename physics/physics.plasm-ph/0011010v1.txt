Abstract

We investigate solutions to the equation ∂tE − D∆E = λS2E, where S(x, t)
is a Gaussian stochastic ﬁeld with covariance C(x − x′, t, t′), and x ∈ Rd.
It is shown that the coupling λcN (t) at which the N -th moment hE N (x, t)i
diverges at time t, is always less or equal for D > 0 than for D = 0. Equality
holds under some reasonable assumptions on C and, in this case, λcN (t) =

N λc(t) where λc(t) is the value of λ at which hexp[λR t
0 S2(0, s)ds]i diverges.
The D = 0 case is solved for a class of S. The dependence of λcN (t) on d
is analyzed. Similar behavior is conjectured when diﬀusion is replaced by

diﬀraction, D → iD, the case of interest for backscattering instabilities in
laser-plasma interaction.

I. INTRODUCTION

We investigate the development of a linear ampliﬁcation in a system driven by the square

of a Gaussian noise. This problem arose and continues to be of interest in modeling the

backscattering of an incoherent high intensity laser light by a plasma. There is a large

litterature on this topic, and we refer the interested reader to Ref. [1] for background.

Our starting point here is the work by Rose and Dubois [2] who investigated the following

equation for the complex amplitude E(x, z) of the scattered electric ﬁeld

∂zE(x, z) − iD∆E(x, z) = λ|S(x, z)|2E(x, z),
z ∈ [0, L], x ∈ Λ ⊂ R2, and E(x, 0) = E0(x).

(1)




In Eq. (1), z and x correspond to the axial and transverse directions in a plasma of length

L and cross-sectional domain Λ. The input at z = 0, E0(x), is a given function of x and Λ
in numerical solutions of Eq. (1) using spectral
will be generally taken to be a torus (e.g.

methods). The coupling constant λ > 0 is proportional to the average laser intensity and

D is a constant parameter introduced for convenience. The complex amplitude of the laser
electric ﬁeld S(x, z) is a homogeneous Gaussian stochastic ﬁeld deﬁned by

hS(x, z)i = hS(x, z)S(x′, z′)i = 0,
hS(x, z)S(x′, z′)∗i = C(x − x′, z − z′),

where the correlation function C(x, z) is the solution to

∂zC(x, z) + i

2∆C(x, z) = 0,

z ∈ [0, L], x ∈ Λ, and C(x, 0) = C(x),

(2)




with C(x) a given function of x [3], normalized so that C(0) ≡ h|S(x, z)|2i = 1.

Using heuristic arguments and numerical simulations, Rose and DuBois found that the
expected value of the energy density of the scattered ﬁeld h|E(x, L)|2i diverged for every
L > 0 as λ increased to some critical value λc(L). The average h|E|2i is over the realizations
of the Gaussian ﬁeld S. This divergence indicates a breakdown in the assumptions made in

2

deriving Eq. (1), which neglects both nonlinear saturation and transient time evolution [2,4].

Physically, it can be interpreted as indicating a change in the nature of the ampliﬁcation

caused by the plasma.

To see the origin of this divergence in its simplest form, consider the case where D is set
equal to zero in Eq. (1), and neglect all dependence of S on x and z. We are then led to the

equation

which yields

dE(z)
dz

= λS2E(z),

E(z) = E(0)eλS 2z,

z > 0.

(3)

1 + S2

Here S2 = S2

2 and S1, S2 are two independent real Gaussian random variables with zero
mean and unit variance. It is easily seen that the probability distribution of E(z), setting
E(0) = 1, has the density

W (E, z) = (2λz)−1E −[1+(2λz)−1]

for E ≥ 1,

z > 0.

(4)

If we now take moments of E at some value L of z, we ﬁnd that hE N (L)i will diverge
whenever 2NλL ≥ 1. At the critical coupling λcN (L) = (2NL)−1, there is a qualitative
transition of the ampliﬁcation of hE N (L)i from a regime where it is dominated by the bulk
of the order-one-ﬂuctuations of S to a regime where it is dominated by the large ﬂuctuations

of S. This toy model can be thought of as an idealization in which the size of the plasma

is very small compared to the correlation length of the laser ﬁeld. This is certainly not a

reasonable physical approximation and we shall later consider situations in which S in Eq.

(3) is z-dependent with a covariance C(z, z′). The equation is then still solvable more or less

explicitly, depending on the form of C, at least as far as the dependence of the divergence

of the moments of E on λ and L is concerned. The main diﬀerence from Eq. (4) is that for
small enough values of λ, the ﬁrst few moments need not diverge for any L.

In this paper, we extend these results to the x-dependent case where iD in Eq. (1) is
replaced by D, i.e. we consider a diﬀusive process in x rather than a diﬀractive one. Some-
what surprisingly the diﬀusion does not suppress the onset of divergences in moments of the

3

ﬁeld. This suggests a similar behavior for the diﬀractive case – in accord with the numerical

results of [2] – but we are unable to prove this at the present time.

Before going on to the formulation and presentation of results for the diﬀusive case, we

make some remarks about the relation between expectations over diﬀerent realizations of
the Gaussian driving term |S|2 and the outcome of a given experiment. Accepting the
idealizations inherent in assuming Gaussian statistics and neglect of nonlinear terms, the

physically relevant question relating to the solution of the stochastic PDE (1) appears to be

the following: What is the probability that for given Λ and L there will be small regions in

Λ through which a signiﬁcant fraction of the total incoming power is backscattered, (here

”total” means through the whole domain Λ). Put more physically, imagine Λ to be divided

up into M ≫ 1 cells of equal area |Λ|/M and let R ≫ 1/M be a speciﬁed number. We want
to compute the probability P that in at least one of the cells the integral of |E|2 over that
cell exceeds R|Λ|. In the case where D is set equal to zero, this can be answered by taking
for the cell size the transverse correlation length of |S|2 and assuming the ﬁeld inside each
cell to be transversally constant and evolving along z under Eq. (3) with a z-dependent S.

One ﬁnds that P greatly increases as λ passes its critical value for the divergence of the

second moment, from P ≪ 1 for λ < λc2(L) to P ≃ 1 for λ > λc2(L). We expect that this
probability will behave similarly in real systems.

The outline of the rest of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II we introduce our diﬀusion-

ampliﬁcation model. In Sec. III we prove that the value of the critical coupling obtained

without the diﬀusion term cannot be less than the one obtained with the diﬀusion term. In

Sec. IV we prove that for a large class of Gaussian ﬁelds S the values of the critical coupling

obtained with or without the diﬀusion term are the same. Section V is devoted to the

explicit solution of the diﬀusion-free problem in the particular case where the on-axis ﬁeld

S(0, z) is a linear functional of a Gauss-Markov process. Finally, in Sec. VI we study the

dependence of the critical coupling on the space dimensionality in the case of a factorable

correlation function C.

II. MODEL AND DEFINITIONS

As explained in the introduction, we consider a modiﬁed version of the linear convective

ampliﬁer model obtained by replacing iD by D on the left-hand side of Eq. (1). Taking
D = 1/2 without loss of generality, one is thus led to the problem
∂tE(x, t) − 1
2∆E(x, t) = λS(x, t)2E(x, t),
t ∈ [0, T ], x ∈ Rd, and E(x, 0) = E0(x),

(5)




where, following the usual notation used in diﬀusion problems, the time variable t (resp. T )

plays the role of the axial space variable z (resp. L). In Eq. (5), we restrict ourselves to the

cases where S(x, t) is a real homogeneous Gaussian ﬁeld deﬁned by

hS(x, t)i = 0,
hS(x, t)S(x′, t′)i = C(x − x′, t, t′),

with the normalization C(0, 0, 0) ≡ hS(x, 0)2i = 1, and we will take E0(x) ≡ 1 as an initial
condition. Note that S(x, t) is not assumed to be stationary in t, and that the rest of our

analysis is essentially unaﬀected if we replace Rd by a d-dimensional torus.

The critical coupling λcN (T ) and its diﬀusion-free counterpart λcN (T ) are deﬁned by

λcN (T ) = inf{λ > 0 : hE(0, T )Ni = +∞},
λcN (T ) = inf{λ > 0 : heN λR T

S(0,t)2dti = +∞},

(6b)

where h.i denotes the average over the realizations of S. For a given T > 0, Eqs. (6) gives
the value of λ at which hE(x, T )Ni blows up with and without diﬀusion respectively.

Finally, in order not to make the calculations too cumbersome, we will use in the following

the compact notation

with s, t ∈ [0, T ], n, m ∈ N (1 ≤ n, m ≤ N), and where the xn(·) are given continuous

III. COMPARISON OF λCN (T ) AND λCN (T )

In this section we prove that λcN (T ) ≤ λcN (T ). We begin with two technical lemmas

that will be useful in the following.

Lemma 1: Suppose the covariance function C(x, t, t′) is continuous. Let µx(t)

2 ≥
... ≥ 0 be the eigenvalues of the covariance operator ˆTC. Here, the superscript x(t) denotes
the N continuous paths xn(t), 1 ≤ n ≤ N. Then hexp λR S(t)2dti < +∞ if and only if

1 ≥ µx(t)

To show (7), consider the Hilbert space of the L2(dt) functions ϕ(n, t) ≡ ϕ(t) with
the scalar product (ϕ, ψ). Since C(s, t) is continuous in (s, t), and therefore bounded in

compact sets, we have that R R C(s, t)2dsdt < +∞. By [5], Theorem VI.23, it follows

that the covariance operator is compact (and self-adjoint) in L2(dt). Therefore there is
an orthonormal basis {ϕj}j≥1 such that ˆTCϕj = µx(t)

< ε

for every xn(·) ∈ Bδ,T , 1 ≤ n ≤ N, where Bδ,T is the set of continuous paths x(·) such that
|x(t)| < δ for every t ∈ [0, T ].

The proof of this lemma is straightforward: from the uniform convergence condition on

C(x, s, t) it follows that ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that |C(s, t) − C0(s, t)| < ε for every xn(·) ∈
Bδ,T , 1 ≤ n ≤ N. Thus, ∀ε′ > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(ϕ, ˆTCϕ) − (ϕ, ˆTC0ϕ)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ (|ϕ|, ˆT|C−C0||ϕ|)

≤ ε′NT,

for every xn(·) ∈ Bδ,T , 1 ≤ n ≤ N. It remains to take ε′ = ε/(NT ), which proves Lemma 2.
We can now state the main result of this section. Namely, that one of the diﬀusion eﬀects

on the divergence of the moments of E(x, T ) is a lowering (or, more exactly, a non-increasing)
of the critical coupling. The rigorous formulation of this result can be stated as the following

proposition.

7

Proposition 1: For every T > 0, if limx→0 sups,t∈[0,T ] |C(x, s, t) − C(0, s, t)| = 0, then

λcN (T ) ≤ λcN (T ).

In order to prove this proposition, one writes the moments of E in terms of the Feynman-

Kac formula

hE(0, T )Ni = (cid:28)(cid:28)exp(cid:20)λZ S(t)2 dt(cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:29)x(t)

,

(8)

where h·ix(t) denotes a N-fold Wiener integral over N Brownian paths xn(t), 1 ≤ n ≤ N,
each arriving at x = 0. Let λ > λcN (T ), i.e. µ1 > (2Nλ)−1, where µ1 is the largest eigenvalue

of the covariance operator ˆtC0. Let φ1(t) be the normalized eigenfunction associated with
µ1, and φ(t) ≡ φ(n, t) = N −1/2φ1(t) for every 1 ≤ n ≤ N. [N.B. : the factor N −1/2 ensures
the normalization (φ, φ) = 1]. By deﬁnition of µx(t)

, one has

1

µx(t)
1 ≥ (φ, ˆTCφ).

By Lemma 2, ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that

(φ, ˆTCφ) ≥ (φ, ˆTC0φ) − ε = Nµ1 − ε

(9)

(10)

for every xn(·) ∈ Bδ,T , 1 ≤ n ≤ N. If one now takes ε < Nµ1 − 1
and (10) that µx(t)

1 > 1/2λ and so, by Lemma 1,

2λ, it follows from Eqs. (9)

(cid:28)exp(cid:20)λZ S(t)2 dt(cid:21)(cid:29) = +∞

for every xn(·) ∈ Bδ,T , 1 ≤ n ≤ N. Finally, since the set of the Brownian paths xn(t) that are
in Bδ,T has a strictly positive Wiener measure, one ﬁnds from Eq. (8) that hE(0, T )Ni = +∞,
so λ ≥ λcN (T ) which proves the proposition 1.

Note that imposing the uniform convergence of C(x, s, t) to C(0, s, t) is not a very restric-

tive condition. As far as we know, it seems to be fulﬁlled by any nonpathological stochastic

ﬁeld S of physical interest.

8

IV. EQUALITY OF λCN (T ) AND λCN (T ) FOR A CLASS OF S

For a large class of Gaussian ﬁelds S it is possible to prove that diﬀusion has no eﬀect

on the onset of the divergence of hE(x, T )Ni, i.e. λCN (T ) = λcN (T ).

Proposition 2: Assume that for every T > 0 one has limx→0 sups,t∈[0,T ] |C(x, s, t) −
C(0, s, t)| = 0, and that |C(x, s, t)| ≤ C(0, s, t) for every x ∈ Rd and s, t ∈ [0, T ]. Then
λcN (T ) = λcN (T ).

The proof of this proposition is as follows: By the uniform convergence condition on

C(x, s, t) and Proposition 1 one already has λcN (T ) ≤ λcN (T ).
It remains to show that
λcN (T ) ≤ λcN (T ). Let µ1 be the largest eigenvalue of the covariance operator ˆtC0. Let φ1(t)
be a principal (normalized) eigenvector for the covariance operator ˆTC. One has

µx(t)
1 = (φ1, ˆTCφ1) ≤ (|φ1|,| ˆTCφ1|) ≤ (|φ1|, ˆTC0|φ1|) ≤ Nµ1,

where the second inequality follows from the condition |C(x, s, t)| ≤ C(0, s, t). Suppose now
λ < λcN (T ), i.e. λ < (2Nµ1)−1. Then λ < (2µx(t)

)−1 and by Lemma 1

1

(cid:28)exp(cid:20)λZ S(t)2dt(cid:21)(cid:29) ≤ exp"NλR T

1 − 2λµx(t)

1

# ≤ exp  NλR T

! .

Since this inequality is uniform over all Brownian paths, we ﬁnally have

hE(0, T )Ni ≤ exp NλR T

0 C(0, t, t) dt
1 − 2Nλµ1

! < +∞,

and therefore λ < λcN (T ), which proves the proposition 2.

This result shows that for Gaussian ﬁelds S fulﬁlling the not so restrictive conditions of

Proposition 2, it is suﬃcient to solve the diﬀusion-free problem to determine the onset of the
divergence of hE(x, T )Ni. It is therefore interesting to show how such ﬁelds can be actually
obtained. To this end, the remaining of this section will be devoted to explicitely construct

two typical examples of stochastic ﬁelds S which fulﬁll the conditions of Proposition 2.

9

A. an example of nonstationary S

The ﬁrst example is the diﬀusive counterpart of the Gaussian ﬁeld deﬁned by Eq. (2).

Let S(x, t) be the solution to

2 ∆S(x, t) = 0,

∂tS(x, t) − 1
t ∈ [0, T ], x ∈ Rd, and S(x, 0) = S(x),




where S(x) is a real homogeneous Gaussian ﬁeld deﬁned by

hS(x)i = 0,
hS(x)S(x′)i = C(x − x′),

with C(x) a given [3] function of x normalized such that C(0) ≡ hS(x, 0)2i = 1. One has

S(x, t) = Z S(k)eikx− 1

2 k2tddk,

(13)

where S(k) is the Fourier transform of S(x), and from Eqs. (12) and (13) it follows that
S(x, t) is a real homogeneous nonstationary Gaussian ﬁeld with

(11)

(12)

(14)

hS(x, t)i = 0,
hS(x, t)S(x′, t′)i = R C(k)eik(x−x′)− 1

2 k2(t+t′)ddk,

where C(k) is the Fourier transform of C(x). Since C(k) is real and positive [3], one has

|C(x, s, t)| ≡ |hS(x, s)S(0, t)i|

Z C(k)eikx− 1

= (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
≤ Z C(k)e− 1

2 k2(s+t)ddk(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2 k2(s+t)ddk = C(0, s, t),

for every x ∈ Rd and s, t ∈ [0, T ], so S(x, t) fulﬁlls the conditions of Proposition 2.

B. an example of stationary S

The second example is provided by a modiﬁed version of Eq. (11) obtained by adding a

source term `a la Langevin on its right-hand side. Namely, let S(x, t) be the solution to




2∆S(x, t) = L(x, t),

∂tS(x, t) − 1
t ∈] − ∞, T ], x ∈ Rd, and S(x,−∞) = 0,

10

(15)

where the Langevin source term L(x, t) is a homogeneous Gaussian white noise deﬁned by

hL(x, t)i = 0,
hL(x, t)L(x′, t′)i = −δ(t − t′)∆xC(x − x′),

(16)

with C(x) a given [3] function of x normalized such that C(0) = 1. The solution to Eq. (15)
reads

S(x, t) = Z ddk(cid:20)eikxZ t

−∞

2 k2(t−s)L(k, s) ds(cid:21) ,
e− 1

(17)

where L(k, t) is the Fourier transform of L(x, t). From Eqs. (16) and (17) it can be shown

that S(x, t) is a real homogeneous stationary Gaussian ﬁeld with

hS(x, t)i = 0,
hS(x, t)S(x′, t′)i = R C(k)eik(x−x′)− 1

2 k2|t−t′|ddk,

(18)

where C(k) is the Fourier transform of C(x). As previously, since C(k) is real and positive
[3], one has

|C(x, s, t)| ≡ |hS(x, s)S(0, t)i|

Z C(k)eikx− 1

= (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
≤ Z C(k)e− 1

2 k2|s−t|ddk(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2 k2|s−t|ddk = C(0, s, t),

for every x ∈ Rd and s, t ∈ [0, T ], and so S(x, t) fulﬁlls the conditions of Proposition 2.

More generally, it can be checked that any real homogeneous Gaussian ﬁeld S(x, t) deﬁned

by

hS(x, t)i = 0,
hS(x, t)S(x′, t′)i = R C(k, t, t′)eik(x−x′)ddk,

where C(k, t, t′) is real and positive, fulﬁlls the conditions of Proposition 2.

V. EXPLICIT SOLUTION OF THE DIFFUSION-FREE PROBLEM FOR A

CLASS OF S

In this section we show that an explicit computation of the diﬀusion-free ampliﬁcation
0 S(0, t)2dt)i can be achieved if S(0, t) is a linear functional of a Gauss-

factor hexp(NλR T

11

Markov process. Note that determining λcN (T ) amounts to ﬁnding the largest eigenvalue of

the covariance operator ˆtC0, which in principle can always be achieved, at least numerically.

As shown above, λcN (T ) ≥ λcN (T ) with equality holding when Proposition 2 is applicable.
Since λcN (T ) = N −1λc1(T ) in the diﬀusion free case, we will take N = 1 in the remaining

of this section without loss of generality.

A. Solution of the diﬀusion-free problem using the Feynman-Kac formula

We consider the case where the Gaussian process S(0, t) can be written as

S(0, t) = hc, Y (t)i,

(19)

where hx, yi ≡ x†y = Pi xiyi, c is a given n-dimensional vector, and Y (t) is a n-dimensional

Gauss-Markov process deﬁned as the solution to the linear stochastic diﬀerential equation

dY (t) + AY (t)dt = GdB(t),

Y (0) Gaussian with hY (0)i = 0.

(20)




Here, A and G are constant n × n matrices, and B(t) is a n-dimensional Brownian motion.
From Eqs. (19) and (20), it follows that one can write the diﬀusion-free ampliﬁcation factor

The solution to Eq. (24) is known to explode in ﬁnite time for large enough λ. For n = 1,

in which case S(0, t) is itself Markovian, Eq. (24) is solved straightforwardly (see Sec. V B).

For n ≥ 2, the solution to Eq. (24) can be obtained by the so-called Hamiltonian method:

The solution K(t) to the Riccati equation (24) is easily checked to be given by

K(t) = P (t)Q(t)−1,

(27)

which explodes if and only if Q(t) becomes singular [6]. Since Eq. (26) is a linear equation,

it can in principle be solved by a symbolic computation program.

B. Application to the n = 1 case

As an example, let us consider the simplest case n = 1 with C(0, t, t′) = e−|t−t′|. In this

C(0, t, t′) = e−|t−t′|.

VI. DEPENDENCE OF THE CRITICAL COUPLING ON SPACE

DIMENSIONALITY

In this section we study the dependence of λcN (T ) on the space dimensionality D. We

will restrict ourselves to the cases where the correlation function C can be written out as

CD(x, t, t′) = Cd(x||, t, t′)CD−d(x⊥, t, t′),

(35)

14

with CD, Cd and CD−d continuous, symmetric, and positive deﬁnite, and where x|| is the

projection of x onto a d-dimensional subspace (d < D) and x⊥ = x− x||. In the following, a
correlation function of this type will be called a factorable correlation function. It is worth

noting that such a correlation function can be very easily obtained, e.g. when the Gaussian

ﬁeld S is deﬁned by either Eq. (14) or Eq. (18) in the cases where C(k) is factorable as
C(k) = Cd(k||)CD−d(k⊥).

We prove that as λ increases, the divergence of hE(x, T )Ni obtained in the original D-
dimensional problem cannot occur before the one obtained in the projected d-dimensional

problem whenever 0 ≤ CD−d(0, t, t) ≤ 1. Since many stochastic ﬁelds S of physical interest,
in optics, do have a factorable correlation function, we expect this result to be useful
e.g.

for the comparison of two-dimensional numerical simulations with experiments and three-

dimensional numerical simulations. Before expressing this result in a more rigorous way, we

begin with two technical lemmas that will be needed in the following.

Lemma 3: Consider a D-dimensional problem and let µx(t)

1

be the largest eigenvalue

of the covariance operator ˆTCD and N given continuous paths x(t). Then λcN (T, D) =
[2 supx(t) µx(t)

]−1.

1

This lemma can be proven straightforwardly by successively considering the inequalities

λ > [2 supx(t) µx(t)

1

]−1 and λ < [2 supx(t) µx(t)

1

]−1, and by following the same lines of reasoning

as for the proofs of Propositions 1 and 2 respectively, where one replaces the N paths x(t) = 0

corresponding to λcN (T ) = [2µx(t)=0

1

]−1 by N paths maximizing µx(t)

1

[7].

Lemma 4: Let K0(s, t), K1(s, t), and K2(s, t) be three symmetric kernels such that:

(i) K0(s, t) = K1(s, t)K2(s, t); (ii) K2 is a positive deﬁnite continuous symmetric kernel;

(iii) 0 ≤ K2(t, t) < 1 and the largest eigenvalue of K1 is positive, or K2(t, t) = 1 and no
condition on the sign of the largest eigenvalue of K1. Then µ1(K0) ≤ µ1(K1), where µ1(Kα)
denotes the largest eigenvalue of Kα.

15

The proof of this lemma is as follows: since K2 is a positive deﬁnite continuous symmetric

kernel, Mercer’s theorem holds [8] and this kernel admits the expansion

K2(s, t) = Xi

aifi(s)fi(t),

(36)

where ai ≥ 0 and fi(t) respectively denote the ith eigenvalue of the operator ˆTK2 and the
associated normalized eigenfunction. Let φ1(t) be a principal (normalized) eigenfunction of

the operator ˆTK0 and µ1(K0) the corresponding largest eigenvalue. From the condition (i)

and Eq. (36), one has

µ1(K0) = (φ1, ˆTK0φ1) = Xi

ai(fiφ1, ˆTK1fiφ1) = Xi

aiMi(ηi, ˆTK1ηi),

(37)

where Mi and ηi(t) are given by

and

Mi = (fiφ1, fiφ1),

ηi(t) = M −1/2

i

fi(t)φ1(t),

such that (ηi, ηi) = 1. By the deﬁnition of µ1(K1) and from K2(t, t) ≤ 1, condition (iii), one
has respectively

and

µ1(K1) ≥ (ηi, ˆTK1ηi),

aifi(t)2# φ1(t)2dt

aiMi = Z "Xi
Xi
= Z K2(t, t)φ1(t)2dt ≤ Z φ1(t)2dt = 1.

(38)

(39)

So, from Eqs. (37), (38), (39) and the condition (iii), it follows that µ1(K0) ≤ µ1(K1), which
proves Lemma 4.

We can now proceed to rigorously express and prove the result stated at the beginning

of this section. Let λcN (T, D) be the critical coupling associated with a D-dimensional

problem in which the correlation function of the Gaussian ﬁeld S is given by CD. One has

the following proposition:

16

Proposition 3: for every T > 0, if CD(x, t, t′) is a factorable correlation function such

that 0 ≤ CD−d(0, t, t) ≤ 1 for 0 ≤ t ≤ T , then λcN (T, D) ≥ λcN (T, d).

The proof of this proposition is straightforward. By the deﬁnition of a factorable corre-

lation function one has CD(s, t) = Cd(s, t)CD−d(s, t), where both Cd(s, t) and CD−d(s, t)

are continuous, symmetric, and positive deﬁnite. Since CD−d(t, t) ≡ CD−d(0, t, t) and
0 ≤ CD−d(0, t, t) ≤ 1 by assumption, one can apply the lemma 4 with K0 = CD, K1 = Cd,
and K2 = CD−d. It follows immediately that µx(t)
denotes the largest

, where ˜µ

eigenvalue of the operator ˆTCd. Let xmax(t) be N paths maximizing µx(t)
supx(t) µx(t)
, from which it follows that supx(t) µx(t)
and, by Lemma 3, λcN (T, D) ≥ λcN (T, d), which proves the proposition 3.

1 = µxmax(t)

VII. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES

In this paper, we have studied the eﬀects of diﬀusion on the divergence of the moments

of the solution to a linear ampliﬁer driven by the square of a Gaussian ﬁeld. We ﬁrst proved

that the divergence yielded by a diﬀusion-free calculation cannot occur at a smaller coupling

constant than the one obtained from the full calculation (i.e. with diﬀusion). Then we have

shown that, in the case where the absolute value of the (uniformly continuous) pump ﬁeld

correlation function is bounded from above by its one-point value, there is no diﬀusion eﬀect

on the onset of the divergence which is therefore given by a diﬀusion-free calculation. In

this context, we have solved the diﬀusion-free problem explicitly when the pump ﬁeld is

a linear functional of a Gauss-Markov process. Finally, we have studied the dependence

of the critical coupling on the space dimensionality in the case of a factorable correlation

function. In particular, we have proved that the divergence obtained in a D-dimensional

problem cannot occur at a smaller coupling constant than the one obtained in the projected

d-dimensional problem (d < D).

As mentioned in the introduction, we would like to extend our results for the diﬀusion-

ampliﬁcation model (5) to the more diﬃcult diﬀraction-ampliﬁcation problem (1). According

17

to Eq. (5), the results obtained in this paper also apply, beside some minor technical modiﬁ-

cations, if the pump ﬁeld is a complex Gaussian ﬁeld as in Eq. (1). The remaining diﬃculty

in extending our results to Eq. (1) lies in controlling the complex Feynman path-integral,

compared to that of the Feynman-Kac formula for the diﬀusive case. Expressing E(x, t) as a
Feynman path-integral and averaging over the realizations of S, one cannot a priori exclude

the possibility that destructive interference eﬀects between diﬀerent path contributions make

the sum of the divergent contributions ﬁnite. Thus one cannot deduce the divergence of the

moments of E(x, L) from that of the ampliﬁcation along paths arriving at the point (x, L).
It is however not unreasonable to expect that Propositions 1, 2, and 3 also apply to the

diﬀraction-ampliﬁcation problem (1). Proving this conjecture is another matter and is the

subject of a future work. Note that in the case of Proposition 2, the on-axis correlation

function of the pump ﬁeld must be real and positive, which is quite restrictive if the pump

ﬁeld is complex. From a practical point of view (e.g. in optics), it would therefore be very

interesting to ﬁnd out whether there exists an enlarged version of this proposition applying

to complex on-axis correlation functions as well.

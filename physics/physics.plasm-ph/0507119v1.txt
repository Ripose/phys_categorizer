Abstract

A kinetic theory for quantum Langmuir waves interacting nonlinearly with quantum ion-acoustic

waves is derived. The formulation allows for a statistical analysis of the quantum correction to the

Zakharov system. The inﬂuence of a background random phase on the modulational instability

is given. In the coherent case, the eﬀect of the quantum correction is to reduce the growth rate.

Moreover, in the classical limit, a bifurcation develops in the dispersion curves due to the presence

of partial coherence. However, the combined eﬀect of partial coherence and a quantum correction

may give rise to an increased modulational instability growth rate, as compared to the classical

case. The results may be of signiﬁcance in dense astrophysical plasmas and laboratory laser–plasma

systems.

INTRODUCTION

The eﬀects from the quantum domain have intriguing consequences for the way we view

the world and the way we interpret physical models, and these eﬀects can be seen in single

particle phenomena. Plasma physics, on the other hand, deals with the collective interaction

of charged particles, and processes related to such. However, there are physical parameter

domains where quantum mechanics and plasma physics need to be taken into account simul-

taneously, e.g. dense and/or hot astrophysical plasmas. Indeed, the creation of pair plasmas

surrounding neutron stars can be viewed as a collective quantum plasma eﬀect. Thus, there

is interest and application for a model taking both collective charged particle eﬀects and

quantum phenomena into account (see, e.g. Refs. 1 and 2).

One of the most prominent models in plasma physics is described by the Zakharov

equations3, in which high frequency Langmuir waves are coupled nonlinearly to low fre-

quency ion-acoustic waves. The statistical properties of this system has been analyzed in

Ref. 4, where a Landau-like damping was found. Recently, a generalization of the Zakharov

system was derived, taking quantum eﬀects into account5. The eﬀect of the quantum cor-

rection was to introduce higher order dispersion into the system of equations, thus altering

the behavior of wave evolution. It was argued in Ref. 5 that these contributions could be

important in astrophysical plasmas, as the plasma densities may become signiﬁcant.

In this paper, we will introduce a kinetic description of the quantum Zakharov equation,

by applying the Wigner transform to the Langmuir propagation equation. The resulting

system of equations may be useful for understanding the properties of partially coherent

Langmuir waves interacting with quantum ion-acoustic waves. We derive the general dis-

persion relation, and analyze the stability of the system. A comparison between monoener-

getic Langmuir waves and random-phase Langmuir waves is given, and it is found that the

interplay between quantum corrections and spectral broadening may alter the instability

properties in novel ways. In particular, it is found that the growth rate for a short wave-

length partially coherent quantum Langmuir wave is larger than the corresponding growth

rate for the classical Langmuir wave. Thus, the interplay between incoherence and quan-

tum eﬀects gives rise to modiﬁed modulational instability growth rates, a result that may

be relevant to astrophysical and intense laboratory laser-plasmas, for which the quantum

parameter may take on signiﬁcant values.

parameter is to introduce higher order dispersion.

The dispersion relation (6) generalizes the results in Refs. 4 and 5, and is valid for partially

coherent quantum Langmuir waves interacting nonlinearly with quantum ion-acoustic waves.

A. Monoenergetic Langmuir waves

In the case of a monoenergetic Langmuir wave, we have ρ0(p) = I0δ(p),, where I0 =

is the background intensity. Then the dispersion relation (6) becomes

Starting from H = 0, successively higher values of H tend to suppress the instability, giving

lower growth rates with a cut-oﬀ at a lower wavenumber, see Fig. 1.

B. Partial coherence

The coherent monoenergetic background distribution gives important information on

wave instabilities. However, in many applications the background ﬁeld is not fully coherent,

but rather displays partial decoherence due to, e.g. noise. The noise, either classical or quan-

tum, may stem from diﬀerent sources, such as thermal eﬀects, weak turbulence, or quantum

ﬂuctuations. Such sources of noise may lead to a background ﬁeld E0 with a random phase

where pW is the width of the distribution. The integrand of (6) has three poles, one real

and two complex, where the real pole is given by

Here A(ω, k) = 3[9ab2 + √3(4b3 + 27a2b4)1/2]/2, a(ω, k) = ω/k(2 + H 2k2), and b(k) =

4H 2/(2 + H 2k2). As the quantum parameter H approaches zero, the complex poles ap-

proaches complex inﬁnity. Thus, in the integration of Eq. (6) we will neglect these poles,

only taking the real pole p0 into account, since the modes corresponding to the complex

poles are quickly damped. Thus, we have

the quantum Zakharov system (1). The damping character due to the ﬁnite width of the

background distribution can clearly be seen, as well as the Landau damping due to the real
pole. We note that as pW →

0, we regain the monoenergetic dispersion relation (7).

C. The classical limit

If H

0, we obtain the classical limit of the dispersion relation (13), when we use a

→

kinetic photon description for the Langmuir waves. The eﬀects of statistical broadening

on the Zakharov system was also analyzed in Ref. 4. We note that the two complex poles

approaches inﬁnity, and only the real pole remains with the value p0 = ω/2k, as it should.

The dispersion relation then reads4

and although the quantum eﬀects have been neglected, the behavior of the function ω(k; pW )

is still rather complicated. The dispersion relation (6) with H = 0 was analyzed analytically

in the long wavelength limit, i.e. ω/k

1, in Ref. 4, and the growth rate was found for a

≫

Gaussian background spectrum. Here we will solve the equation (14) for all wave lengths.

Letting ω = Re ω+iγ, we may solve Eq. (13) numerically for the growth rate γ, using diﬀerent

values of the widths pW . In the Figs. 2 and 3 we have plotted the solutions for H = 0 and a

number of values of pW . The results show on a more complicated dispersion structure than

in the coherent case. The asymptotic behavior of the growth rate for short wavelengths has

been depicted in Fig. 4, using a number of diﬀerent values on the decoherence width pW .

For large k, the growth rate has a linear dependence on the wavenumber, the slope being

determined by the values of the width pW .

D. Quantum eﬀects on the instability growth rate

When H is nonzero, the combined eﬀects of quantum correction and decoherence make

themselves apparent in the dispersion relation (13) through new and novel wave modes. In

Fig. (5) we display the growth rate γ as a function of the wave number k. As compared to

6

the classical case, the combined eﬀect of partial coherence and quantum eﬀects, i.e. ﬁnite

pW and H respectively, is to make the modulational instability growth rate smaller for long

wavelength perturbations. However, the interesting eﬀect is for short wavelengths, where

the modes introduced due the ﬁnite spectral width is ampliﬁed by the quantum corrections.

Thus, we may expect much stronger growth rates for short wavelength perturbations, making

these dominant in quantum plasmas. In Fig. 5 the dispersion curves for a value H = 0.25

of the quantum parameter has been plotted. The strong growth rate for short wavelengths

can clearly be seen.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The eﬀects of partial coherence in quantum plasmas, such as in the form of a ran-

dom phase, is of interest in certain plasmas, such as astrophysical plasmas5,6, and the

next generation laser plasma systems11,12. Moreover,

in such system, the density may

even reach values of5,6 1023
H = ¯hωpi/kBTe ∼
ues, such that the higher order dispersive terms in Eqs. (1) become important. Even in

1. Thus, the quantum parameter H may attain appreciable val-

107 K, giving

the cases of small a quantum correction, this eﬀect combined with Langmuir wave decoher-

ence will yield a strongly growing mode for short wavelengths, and could lead to signiﬁcant

changes in extreme astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Thus, the combination of inco-

herence and quantum eﬀects may yield rich and interesting dynamics of Langmuir wave

propagation in such plasmas. However, a detailed analysis of possible applications is left for

future research.

Here we have analyzed the statistical properties of the quantum Zakharov system, giving

the dynamics of high frequency Langmuir waves in terms of a kinetic equation. This enabled

the investigation into the eﬀects of partial coherence of the quantum Langmuir wave, in

particular the implications due to a random phase, and it was found that such a system

exhibits an interesting dispersion structure. In particular, the combined eﬀect of decoherence

and quantum corrections gives rise to new dispersion curves as well as increased modulational

instability growth rates, as compared to the case of a classical coherent and partial coherent

Langmuir wave.

growth rate for short wavelengths, while the long wavelength modes are damped by the

quantum corrections (see Fig. 1).

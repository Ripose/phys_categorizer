Restricted path integral Monte Carlo simulations are used to calculate the equilibrium properties
of hydrogen in the density and temperature range of 9.83 × 10−4 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.153 gcm−3 and 5000 ≤
T ≤ 250 000 K. We test the accuracy of the pair density matrix and analyze the dependence on the
system size, on the time step of the path integral and on the type of nodal surface. We calculate
the equation of state and compare with other models for hydrogen valid in this regime. Further,
we characterize the state of hydrogen and describe the changes from a plasma to an atomic and
molecular liquid by analyzing the pair correlation functions and estimating the number of atoms
and molecules present.

In spite of the simple composition, hydrogen exhibits a
surprisingly complex phase diagram, which is the subject
of numerous experimental and theoretical approaches.
In this work, we study the high temperature regime of
5000 ≤ T ≤ 250 000 K where hydrogen undergoes a
smooth transition with increasing temperature from a
molecular ﬂuid through an atomic regime and ﬁnally to
a two component plasma of electrons and protons (see
Fig. 1). The properties of hydrogen in this regime are
crucial for the evolution of stars and the characteristics
of the Jovian planets.

A variety of simulation techniques and analytical mod-
els have been developed to describe hydrogen at low den-
sity. This regime has been studied with chemical models
[1, 2, 3] that describe hydrogen as a mixture of inter-
acting molecules, atoms, free protons and electrons. The
chemical composition is determined by minimizing an ap-
proximate free energy function constructed from known
theoretical limits.
In this paper, we focus on low and
intermediate densities 9.83 × 10−4 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.153 gcm−3
corresponding to 14 ≥ rs ≥ 2.6, where one expects the
chemical models to work well although the properties
of hydrogen are determined by the complex interplay of
long-range Coulomb forces leading to strong coupling and
bound states as well as degeneracy eﬀects.

All these eﬀects can also be described from ﬁrst prin-
ciples simulation. There are ab initio methods such as
restricted path integral Monte Carlo simulations (PIMC)
[4, 5, 6] and density functional theory molecular dynam-
ics (DFT-MD) [7, 8]. The focus of the work is to test the
equation of state (EOS) derived from chemical models
and the actual density-temperature limits of the validity
of the chemical picture. Additionally, we provide data

to determine the parameters of the free energy models.
Chemical models are expected to become inaccurate in
regions of high density where the lifetime of molecules
reduces to a few molecular vibrations [8].

We present results from new, more accurate, PIMC
simulations. First, we analyze the accuracy of the pair
density matrix and the error of the “time” discretization.
Then we analyze the ﬁnite size dependence of the derived
EOS and discuss the ﬁxed node errors by comparing re-
sults from simulations using free particle (FP) nodes and
variational nodes. Furthermore, we calculate pair corre-
lation functions which we use in conjunction with a clus-

ter analysis to characterize the state of hydrogen at dif-
ferent temperatures and densities. We use atomic units
(lengths in Bohr radii and energies in Hartrees) through-
out this work except where indicated otherwise.

II. PATH INTEGRAL MONTE CARLO
METHOD

A. Restricted Path Integral

The density matrix (DM) of a fermion system at tem-
perature kBT = 1/β can be written as an integral over
all paths Rt,

ρ(R0, Rβ; β) =

(−1)P

dRt e−S[Rt].

Rt stands for the entire paths of N particles in 3 di-
mensional space Rt = (r1t, . . . , rN t) beginning at R0 and
ending at PRβ. P labels the permutation of the particles
and (−1)P to its signature. For non-relativistic particles
interacting with a potential V (R), the action of the path
S[Rt] is given by,

In practice one discretizes [9] the path into a ﬁnite num-
ber of imaginary time slices M corresponding to a time
step τ = β/M .

For fermionic systems the integration is complicated
due to the cancellation of positive and negative contribu-
tions to the integral, (the fermion sign problem). It has
been shown [10, 11] that one can evaluate the path inte-
gral by restricting the path to only speciﬁc positive con-
tributions. One introduces a reference point R∗ on the
path that speciﬁes the nodes of the DM, ρ(R, R∗, t) = 0.
A node-avoiding path for 0 < t ≤ β neither touches nor
crosses a node: ρ(R(t), R∗, t) 6= 0. By restricting the
integral to node-avoiding paths,

ρF (Rβ, R∗; β) =

(Υ(R∗) denotes the restriction) the contributions are
positive and therefore PIMC represents, in principle, a
solution to the sign problem. The method is exact if
the exact fermionic DM is used for the restriction. How-
ever, the exact DM is only known in a few cases. Most
applications have approximated the fermionic DM by a
determinant of single particle DMs,

This approach has been extensively applied using the
free particle (FP) nodes derived from the single-particle
density matrix [11]:

ρ1(r, r′, β) = (4πλβ)−3/2 exp

−(r − r′)2/4λβ

(5)

(cid:8)

with λ = ¯h2/2m, including applications to dense hydro-
gen [4, 5, 6]. It can be shown that for temperatures larger
than the Fermi energy, the interacting nodal surface ap-
proaches the FP nodal surface. In addition, in the limit
of low density, exchange eﬀects are negligible: the nodal
constraint has a small eﬀect on the path and therefore
its precise shape is not important. The FP nodes also
become exact in the limit of high density when kinetic
eﬀects dominate over the interaction potential. However,
for the densities and temperatures under consideration,
interactions could have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the nodal
surfaces.

To gain some quantitative estimate of the possible ef-
fect of the nodal restriction on the thermodynamic prop-
erties, it is necessary to try an alternative. In addition
to FP nodes, we used nodal surface of a variational den-
sity matrix (VDM) [12] derived from a variational princi-
ple that includes interactions and atomic and molecular
bound states. We assume a trial DM with parameters qi
that depend on imaginary time β and R′,

ρ(R, R′; β) = ρ(R, q1, . . . , qm) .

to regain the correct FP limit.
It follows from Eq. 7
that at low temperature, the VDM goes to the lowest en-
ergy wave function within the variational basis. For an
isolated atom or molecule this will be a bound state, in
contrast to the delocalized state of the FP DM. A further
discussion of the VDM properties is given in [12]. Note
that these nodes are only used to determine the nodal
restriction in Eq. (II.3). The complete potential is taken
into account in the path integral action as discussed in
detail in [9].

B. Accuracy of the Method

The numerical implementation of the PIMC method
requires one to make several approximations. Inaccura-
cies can be caused by statistical errors from the MC inte-
gration, inaccuracies in the numerically determined pair
density matrices, a dependence on the time step of the
path integral because of N -body (N ≥ 3) correlations,
ﬁnite size eﬀects, and nodal errors from approximations
in the trial density matrix. Their eﬀects on the accuracy
of the computed thermodynamic averages are quantita-
tively estimated in this section.

Statistical errors in the estimators for the thermody-
namic quantities are calculated from the block averages
generated by the MC simulations. The correlations be-
tween blocks are taken into account by performing a
blocking analysis [13]. The resulting error bars (one stan-
dard deviation) are given for all observables throughout
this paper as a number in parenthesis referring to the
least signiﬁcant digit.

In the following discussion, we compare the internal
energy and the pressure calculated using the virial theo-
rem:

3P v = 2K + V

(11)

where v is the volume of the simulation cell, K the kinetic
energy and V the potential energy. Accurate estimation
of the pressure requires a high accuracy in the kinetic
and the potential energies because they tend to cancel
out. In the molecular regime at low density, both terms,
dominated by intra-molecular contributions, cancel to a
large extent leaving behind the molecular gas pressure,
which is much less than the inter-molecular forces. As
a result, the pressure is, in general, signiﬁcantly more
sensitive to approximations than other quantities such
as the internal energy.

1. Pair Density Matrix

If one only used the bare potential as in Eq. 2 (the
primitive approximation for the action), the convergence
would be very slow [14] and would result in an extremely
ineﬃcient many-particle simulations.
Instead, we nu-
merically solve the two-particle problem with the matrix

squaring technique [15]. Numerical representations of the
exact pair density matrices are stored in tables used by
the PIMC simulation program by expanding in the small
variables s and z:

and r and r′ denote the separation of the two particles
at adjacent time slices. The accuracy of these tables is
crucial for all computed results. Using the precomputed
pair density matrices allows one to employ a much larger
time step because one starts with a solution of the two-
particle problem. Fig. 2 shows how accurate this method
is. The internal energy of an isolated hydrogen atom at
suﬃciently low temperature (T = 10 000 K) in a large box
(L = 26) is compared with the exact ground state energy
of −13.6 eV. The temperature was chosen low enough so
that excited states can be neglected; the contribution to
the energy from the occupation of the ﬁrst excited state
is 7 ·10−5 eV at this temperature. Also shown is how well
the kinetic energy K and the potential energy V satisfy
the virial theorem 2K + V = 0, thus determining the ac-
curacy with which the pressure can be determined. For
a time step of τ −1 = 106K, the analysis shows a quick
convergence with the order of terms considered in the ac-
tion expansion Eq. (12). Using terms up nA = 3 reduces

the error to 0.033 (3) eV in energy and to 0.039 (8) eV
for 2K + V . This corresponds to an inaccuracy in the
pressure equivalent to a non-interacting molecular gas at
T = 260 (30) K.

3. Finite Size Dependence

The estimation of the ﬁnite size errors is more diﬃ-
cult to assess because the needed PIMC simulations are
computationally much more demanding. The required
computer time increases rapidly with the number of par-
ticles making it challenging to obtain converged results
for paths corresponding to large systems.

Most results from many-body simulations reported in
this work were calculated with N = 32 pairs of elec-
trons and protons in a periodically repeated simulation
cell. To study the eﬀect on N , we performed simulations
for N = 16 and 64 pairs of protons and electrons for a
density of rs = 2.6 and T ≥ 10 000 K. We chose the
highest density under consideration because one expects
the ﬁnite size dependence to be largest there due to the
stronger interaction between the atoms.

FIG. 3: The error in the virial as a function of the number of
time slices for an isolated hydrogen molecule. The classical
nuclei are ﬁxed at the equilibrium bond length, thus the exact
value for 2K + V is zero at a suﬃciently low temperature.

Employing the pair approximation of the density ma-
trix does not include correlation eﬀects for three or more
particles (for example between one electron and two pro-
tons). We now estimate how small the time step must
be to obtain a given accuracy for an isolated molecule.
Fig. 3 shows results for diﬀerent time steps and tem-
peratures with the nuclei kept ﬁxed at the equilibrium
position of R = 1.4008. From the virial theorem, it fol-
lows that 2K + V = 0 at a suﬃciently low temperature.
The exact energy per atom is −15.973 eV [16]. The T
dependence is small suggesting that the electrons are in
the ground state. However, one ﬁnds a signiﬁcant depen-
dence on the time step. Using τ −1 = 2 × 106K reduces
the error in the energy per atom to 0.036(3) eV and in
2K + V to 0.090 (16) eV. The time step error is larger
than the errors of the inaccuracies in the pair density
matrices discussed above. The error in 2K + V corre-
sponds to a pressure of an non-interacting molecular gas
at T = 700 (100) K, which provides us with an approxi-
mate limit of accuracy in the equation of state calculated
from many-particle simulations with τ −1 = 2 × 106K.

FIG. 4: Finite size error of the pressure as a function of tem-

The ﬁnite size dependence of the pressure, shown in
Fig. 4, is small at high temperatures but grows to ap-
proximately 4 (2) % near T = 30 000 K. In this regime,
the hydrogen undergoes structural changes involving the
formation of atoms, which aﬀect the pressure. This study
provides us only with an estimate of the ﬁnite size de-
pendence. An extrapolation to N → ∞ would require
signiﬁcantly larger systems, not currently feasible at low
temperatures.

Fig. 5 shows the ﬁnite size error of the internal en-
ergy. The smaller systems are more strongly bound by
approximately 0.2 eV per atom, probably because of the
interaction of a charge with its own image. For lower
densities, we expect this value to be smaller.

4. Nodal Approximation

In the above, we have studied controlled approxima-
tions. The only uncontrolled approximation in the re-
stricted PIMC method is the use of trial density matrix
to constrain the paths. The nodal surfaces are impor-
tant only if the electrons are degenerate: at low temper-
atures or at high densities. Recall that in this work we
focus on hydrogen only at low density, where the elec-
trons are bound in atoms and molecules and have a low
or moderate degeneracy. Even at low density, one still
needs a nodal surface in order to prevent the formation
of unphysical clusters like H3 and H4 or even the col-
lapse of the entire system, but the precise shape of the
nodes is not important at low density as shown in Fig. 6.
Comparing FP and VDM nodes for rs = 2.6, one only
ﬁnds diﬀerences in the pressure for T ≤ 15 625 K, which is
approximately where, at this density, the system shows
a signiﬁcant molecular signature (see section III B and
Fig. 16). In this regime, FP nodes systematically lead to
a too high pressure, while simulations with VDM nodes
stay closer to the prediction of a semi-empirical chemical
model [1]. At a lower density, rs = 4, results from FP
and VDM nodes agree within the error bars. The dif-
ferences in the internal energy, as shown in Fig. 7, using
FP and VDM nodes are signiﬁcantly smaller than the
pressure deviations. One either ﬁnds agreement within
the error bars or that VDM nodes predict lower inter-
nal energies, which was used in [17] to show that VDM
nodes are the more accurate nodal surface. The observed
energy diﬀerences did not exceed 0.1 eV per atom.

For even lower density, the nodes are less relevant be-
cause they become only important in a collision of two
molecules, which occur less frequently at lower density.
This trend can also be understood in terms of the degen-

eracy of the electrons. The degree of degeneracy mani-
fests itself in the path integral formalism by the probabil-
ity for the electrons to be involved in a permutation. At
high temperature, the paths are very short and permu-
tations are rare. At low temperature and high density,
the paths are long and can form long permutation cy-
cles. However in hydrogen at low density, the paths are
localized due to the attraction in atoms and molecules
and permutations are rare. Fig. 1 shows that the per-
mutation probability never reaches 1% for rs = 4 (see
Tab. I). For higher densities, the permutation probabil-
ity is increased as indicated by the contour lines. This
is consistent with the temperature and density depen-

Tab. I gives the complete set of energies and pressures
at 6 densities and 8 temperatures. We now compare these
results with several models for hydrogen. We begin our
discussion by studying the internal energy per atom as
a function of temperature shown in Figs. 8 - 11 for two

selected densities corresponding to rs = 10.0 and 2.6.
Generally, we ﬁnd a fairly good overall agreement with
the EOS by SC [1] over the entire temperature and den-
sity range discussed in this work. The agreement is par-
ticularly good in the molecular and atomic regime for
rs = 10.0, as shown in Fig. 9. There the SC energies are
within the error bars of the PIMC results. At higher tem-
perature shown in Fig. 8, we ﬁnd systematic deviations
of up to 5 eV per atom at T = 250 000 K. They indicate
that the SC energies are too low at high temperatures
and too high at intermediate temperatures (see Fig. 8).
One possible explanation for the deviations at high tem-
perature is that the SC model underestimates the degree
of ionization (see discussion in [20]).

We also studied these deviations as a function of den-

EOS underestimates the energy, increases with density.
At rs = 10.0, the cross-over is near 70 000 K compared to
130 000 K (Fig. 10) at rs = 2.6. At temperatures below
20 000 K for rs = 2.6, one also ﬁnds some small deviations
up to 0.5 eV per atom (Fig. 11).

tEx) [18] (not shown for 5000 K since nearly identical to SC)
and PIMC calculations .

Fig. 12 shows a comparison of energy vs. density for
several temperatures.
It shows that the SC-EOS over-
estimates the energy for T = 5000 K and 31 250 K and
underestimates it for 125 000 K for densities higher than
those corresponding to rs = 2.6.

Now let us compare the pressure from the SC-EOS
with that from the PIMC simulation using Eq. 11 in
Tab. I. We ﬁnd remarkably good agreement of the entire
range of temperature and density under consideration.
For a low density such as rs = 10.0, this is shown in
Fig. 13. As expected, one ﬁnds that both methods in-
terpolate between the limit of an ideal Fermi gas at high
temperatures and non-interacting molecular gas at low
temperatures. Fig. 14 conﬁrms the good agreement at a
higher density of rs = 2.6. As a result of the strong inter-
actions at this density, one ﬁnds that the pressure at low
temperatures is signiﬁcantly above the non-interacting
molecular gas limit.

We ﬁnd that the SC-EOS underestimates the pressure
by about 3% for T > 62 500 K. This diﬀerence is outside
the error bar from the approximations in PIMC discussed
in section II B and could be interpreted as a further in-
dication, in addition to the observed energy deviations,
that the SC model underestimates the degree of ioniza-
tion at high temperatures. For intermediate tempera-

increased statistical errors in the PIMC pressure are of
the same size as the observed deviations.

In our comparison, we also included results from the
activity expansion by Rogers [18], which shows very good
agreement in pressure and internal energy (see Figs. 9,

In the molecular and atomic regime, one also
ﬁnds good agreement with the ﬂuid variational theory
(FVT) by Juranek and Redmer [19] as shown in Figs. 9,
11, 13, and 14. For higher temperatures, the FVT model
is not applicable since it does not include ionization of
atoms.

B. Pair Correlation Functions

There are four diﬀerent pair correlation functions
which can be directly obtained from many-body simu-
lations and provide direct information about the state of
the system. Shown in the following ﬁgures is an extensive
set of pair correlations which allow one to estimate the
microscopic structure of the system and allow a direct
comparison with other simulations. The proton-proton
pair correlation functions from PIMC simulations with
free particle nodes are shown in Fig. 16. For T <∼ 20 000 K
a peak at the bond length of 1.4 emerges, which clearly
demonstrates the formation of molecules. We found it
useful to multiply the pair correlation function by an ex-
tra density factor n = N/v so that the area under the
peak is proportional to the molecular fraction. The peak
height gets smaller with decreasing density as a result of
entropic dissociation of the molecules, driven by the num-
ber of unbound states at low density. Thermal dissocia-
tion also reduces the number of molecules with increasing
<∼ 2, we expect that pressure dissoci-
temperature. For rs
ation diminishes the number of molecules with increasing
density [14] but this density range is beyond the scope of
this paper.

The proton-electron pair correlation function multi-
plied by the density is shown in Fig. 17. The peak
near the origin shows the increased probability of ﬁnding
an electron near a proton due to the Coulomb attrac-
tion. The peak height decreases with temperature and

entropy ionization respectively. At low temperature, the
peak can be interpreted as occupation of bound states al-
though (unbound) scattering states can also contribute.
From proton-electron pair correlation alone, one cannot
distinguish between an atomic and a molecular state.

C. State of Hydrogen

In this section, we discuss the phase diagram of hy-
drogen as shown in Fig. 1. The diagram shows the ap-
proximate location of the molecular, the atomic and the
plasma regimes. The PIMC simulations, since they are
based on the basic description in terms of electrons and
protons, do not directly lend themselves to determining
the number of compound particles such as molecules and
atoms. (Methods for determining this from PIMC sim-
ulations will be discussed in a future publication.)
In
order to obtain an estimate of the atomic and molecu-
lar fraction, we employed a cluster analysis of the PIMC
path conﬁgurations. As described in [21], we consider
two protons as belonging to one cluster if they are less
than 1.9 aB apart. An electron belongs to one particular
cluster if it is less than 1.4 aB away from any proton in
the cluster. The two cut-oﬀ radii were chosen from the
molecular and atomic ground state distribution. This
analysis gives reasonable estimates for the molecular and
atomic fractions at low temperatures. At high tempera-
ture, it overestimates the number of bound states because
even in an (unbound) collision, two particles are counted
falsely as being part of the cluster. We corrected for this
by applying an additional criterion: a particle can only
be considered as bound if the diﬀerence in action to re-
move it from the cluster is positive. This method leads
to the expected corrections at high temperature. (The
regime boundaries in Fig. 1 discussed below are hardly
aﬀected by the additional correction.)

The lower dashed line represents the region where 60%

peak at small separations comes from the formation of
the molecular bond. For pairs of electrons with parallel
spin, one always ﬁnds a strong repulsion due to the Pauli
exclusion principle and to a lesser extent to the Coulomb
repulsion. This is shown in Fig. 19.

of the protons are bound in molecules. When the number
of protons bound in atoms ( i.e. with an electron) drop
below 40% we labeled this state as plasma as shown in the
upper dashed-dotted line. It should be emphasized that
the location of these lines depends on the choice of these
limits as well as on the cut-oﬀ radii used to determine
the clusters in this place. Fig. 1 also shows the location
of isobars, which appear as almost straight lines in this
double logarithmic graph. The slope is diﬀerent from the
ideal gas because the pressure depends on ionization and
dissociation.

Tab. I shows the fraction of the three most frequently
found species: molecules, atoms and free protons where
x is deﬁned as the probability of ﬁnding a proton in a
certain compound particle. It should be noted that the
sum: xH+ +xH+xH2 is less than 1 since other clusters
have a non-zero probability. The largest contributions
besides those listed are H+
2 with a maximum of 0.06 for
rs = 2.6 and T = 15 625 K followed by H3 with x ≤ 0.03
and H− with x ≤ 0.02. Even larger clusters occur very
infrequently. The cluster analysis also gives an estimate
for the fraction of free electrons, which agrees well with
the number of ionized protons: xH+ .

Fig. 20 shows a comparison of the fraction of molecules
and ionized atoms for rs = 10. One ﬁnds that the molec-
ular fractions decays rapidly with temperature. The re-
sulting atoms are then ionized at even higher temper-
atures leading to the observed increase in the number
of free protons. The PIMC predictions for the molecu-

lar fraction agree very well with the SC model as well
as with the FVT. On the other hand, the PIMC results
shows a signiﬁcantly higher degree of ionization than SC.
The same comparison for a higher density of rs = 2.6 in
Fig. 21 shows that the cluster analysis leads to smaller
number of molecules than predicted by the SC model.

Summarizing one can say that the cluster analysis pro-
vides us with reasonable estimates for the number of
atoms and molecules in the considered density range. We
caution the reader that other deﬁnitions of atoms and
molecules, possible in a many-body hydrogen, while giv-
ing qualitatively similar results, may diﬀer quantitatively.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Acknowledgments

In this work, we studied the high-temperature equation
of state of hydrogen at low and intermediate densities
and ﬁnd a remarkably good agreement with the SC-EOS.
Generally, one ﬁnds that the deviations in the energy are
more pronounced than the diﬀerences in the pressure.
We ﬁnd signiﬁcant deviations in the EOS of temperatures
≈ 100000K, most likely caused by an underestimate of
the degree of ionization at those temperatures. In future
work, we will extend this comparison to higher densities.
There one expects to ﬁnd substantial diﬀerences between

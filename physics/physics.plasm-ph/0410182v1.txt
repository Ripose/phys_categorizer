A 1D2V open boundary Vlasov-Ampere code has been implemented with the aim of making a
detailed investigation of the propagation of ﬁnite amplitude electromagnetic disturbances in an
inhomogeneous magnetized plasma. The code is being applied to study the propagation of an exter-
nally driven electromagnetic signal, localized at one boundary of the integration interval, through a
given equilibrium plasma conﬁguration with inhomogeneous plasma density and magnetic ﬁeld.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Self-consistent electromagnetic electromagnetic ﬁelds in spatially non-uniform plasmas represent one of the funda-
mental aspects of plasma physics with several implications both in microwave and laser based experiments. Since the
‘70es extensive theoretical [1, 2, 3, 4] and experimental [5, 6, 7] investigations have been devoted to ponderomotive
eﬀects, particle acceleration, wavebreaking, resonant absorption in plasmas with density gradients. The problem is
relevant for magnetized plasmas, as well, when Bernstein waves are excited as a consequence of mode conversion close
to the hybrid plasma resonances. Recently, a renewed interest for electron Bernstein wave physics has apperaed due
to the possibility of implementing an attractive radiation emission diagnostic in fusion plasmas [8, 9, 10]. Then it is
interesting to investigate the kinetic aspects of the propagation of electromagnetic as well as electrostatic ﬁelds in a
non uniform plasma with arbitrary density and magnetic ﬁeld scales, and electric ﬁeld amplitudes.

A 1D2V open boundary Vlasov-Ampere code has been implemented with the aim of achieving a more realistic
investigation of the propagation of a ﬁnite amplitude signal in an inhomogeneous plasma, and it has been applied to
study the propagation of an externally driven, localized charge density ﬂuctuation in an unmagnetized plasma with
an equilibrium spatially nonuniform density [11]. Previous analyses of magnetized plasmas [12, 13], carried out in
a slab geometry with periodic boundary conditions, have shown that strongly anisotropic distribution functions are
produced both in the electron [12] and in the ion [13] populations during the interaction of plasma with an externally
applied propagating electrostatic wave. In those cases the background plasma inhomogeneities could be modelled by
varying the ratio of the pump frequency to the electron plasma frequency [14].

Here, the propagation of the spatially localized ﬁnite amplitude electromagnetic perturbation in a homogeneous
magnetized collisionless plasma is preliminarly investigated, the ﬁnal aim being the study of electromagnetic ﬁelds
propagating in a given equilibrium plasma conﬁguration where both plasma density and magnetic ﬁeld are inhomo-
geneous. The solution of the Vlasov equation, coupled with the Ampere equation, provides the electron distribution
function and the electrostatic ﬁeld in the whole spatial range 0 < x < L, at any time. Results are presented relevant
to moderate amplitude electromagnetic ﬁeld perturbations.

II. THE PHYSICAL MODEL

Let us consider a one dimensional magnetized plasma, localized in the region 0 > x > L, homogeneous in the plane
(y, z), with unperturbed density n0 = ne0 = Zni0, and magnetic ﬁeld B0 = B0ˆez. The relevant dimensionless non
relativistic Vlasov equations take the form

normalized length scale is the electron skin depth de = 1, while the (dimensionless) electrostatic length scale, the
Debye length, is equal to the normalized thermal velocity, λD = vth,e/c. In Eq.(1) the components of the electric ﬁeld
are the sum of two parts Etot
x,y(x, t), the consistent ﬁeld, satisfying the Maxwell equations, and the
externally applied driving ﬁeld, respectively. Moreover, the magnetic ﬁeld is also the sum of the constant background
ﬁeld and of the self-consistent ﬁeld, Btot
z (x, t). The self-consistent ﬁelds satisfy the Maxwell

[0, L] is the position where the driving ﬁeld acts (usually, x0 = 0), ω is the

allows one to perturb the system at one boundary of the range [0, L] either by an electromagnetic (ǫ1 = 0, ǫ2
= 0) or
by an electrostatic (ǫ1
= 0, ǫ2 = 0) disturbance. The consistent polarization and wave vector are then deﬁned by the
kinetic plasma response, which comprises the nonlinear coupling between particle motion and ﬁelds contained in the
Vlasov Eq.(1).

III. THE RESULTS OF NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

Tests aimed at reproducing the wave-plasma interaction in the low-amplitude (linear) regime have been performed
by injecting a ”pure” electromagnetic wave (i.e. Edr
x = 0) at the left boundary, x = 0, with ǫ2 = 0.005, or by exciting
y = Bdr
an electrostatic perturbation (i.e. Edr

dimensionless units the magnetic ﬁeld is equal to the electron cyclotron frequency and the value B = Ωce = 2 has been
chosen in all simulations. Two values of the pump frequency have been considered: ω = 0.95 (a) and ω = 2.1 (b).
Note that the upper hybrid frequency ωuh = √1 + B2 = 2.24 and the upper cutoﬀ ωco = B/2 + p1 + B2/4 = 2.41.
According to the linear theory of cyclotron waves [15] the cold branches of the dispersion relation of an extraordinary
mode propagating perpendicularly to the magnetic ﬁeld have a dimensionless wave vector k
0.94 for
two chosen frequencies, 2.1 and 0.95, respectively. As it is seen in Fig. 1 the k-spectra of the electric ﬁeld manifest
a sharp maximum around the corresponding wave vectors, together with other features at higher k’s, independently

of the method of excitation (electrostatic or electromagnetic). Moreover, since we are dealing with a hot plasma,
we should expect also a component at higher k, due to the conversion of the incoming electromagnetic energy into
electrostatic electron Bernstein waves. In this respect the most interesting spectrum is that of case (b), since the
Ωce < ω < ωuh, where modes with k
10.8 should be excited. However, in this preliminary work where we deal
with ”small” amplitude external pumps and relatively short time of propagation, this eﬀect is not seen. In Fig. 2
we plot the longitudinal and transversal components of the electric ﬁeld, ﬁrst and second frame, respectively, in the
case of an electromagnetic external driver of amplitude ǫ2 = 0.005 and frequency ω = 2.1. We see that near the left
boundary the energy is transferred to the electrostatic counterpart and then, after propagating to the right a few de
at x
ωpe where
the electromagnetic (applied) ﬁeld should dominate. We think that this is due to the warm plasma response. In Fig.
3 we draw the isolines of the electron distribution function at t = 100 in the (x, vx) phase space at ﬁxed vy velocity,
namely vy =
0.19, second frame (B). This ﬁgure shows the rotation of the particles
around the magnetic ﬁeld corresponding vortex like structures of typical size of the order of the selected vy value.

In the present analysis the value vth,e/c = 0.14 has been chosen, which corresponds to an electron temperature
10keV . It is well known that in order to describe correctly the collisionless cyclotron waves propagating
of Te ≈
perpendicularly to the magnetic ﬁeld, the velocity dependence of the electron mass should be considered. The
propagation of cyclotron waves is however well described already by the non relativistic theory. Moreover, for the
frequency values which have been considered, that is ω = 0.95 and 2.1 even in the relativistic case, no appreciable
collisionless damping is expected.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work the Vlasov equation for electrons, coupled with the Maxwell equations, has been numerically solved in
an open plasma slab, where the source of the electromagnetic ﬁelds is localized at one of the two spatial boundaries.
The magnetized plasma responses to both purely electromagnetic or electrostatic excitations, at small amplitudes,
have been studied. The ﬁeld disturbance is applied in the form of a purely transverse propagating EM wave or,
alternatively, as a purely ES ﬁeld. Then, the injected EM energy goes into the longitudinal and transverse components
of the ﬁeld, almost independently on the excitation details, and the wavevectors are generated consistently during the
wave propagation. It is seen that, even in the case of a purely EM excitation, a large fraction of the injected energy
can go into the ES ﬁeld.

The code is particularly suitable for exploring the non linear stage of the wave-plasma interaction. The application

of the code to large amplitude driving ﬁelds is under way.

We have performed HNC calculations for dense beryllium plasma as studied experimentally using x-ray Thom-
son scattering, recently. We treated non-equilibrium situations with different electron and ion temperatures
which are relevant in pump-probe experiments on ultra-short time scales. To consider quantum effects ade-
quately, we used effective pair potentials to describe the interactions. Results are compared with classical as
well as quantum corrected Debye model calculations.

1 Introduction

The dynamic structure factor S (k, ω) is the spectral function of the density ﬂuctuations. It determines funda-
mental properties of the plasma such as pair distribution functions, equation of state data, and transport coefﬁ-
cients [1]. Simultaneously, it gives direct access to the frequency spectrum of amplitude-modulated electromag-
netic waves scattered off the plasma and, therefore, is a key quantity for plasma diagnostics. We are especially
interested in strongly coupled plasmas with densities typical of solid state and temperatures of several eV which
are also known as warm dense matter (WDM). Intense x-ray radiation sources are needed to perform scattering
experiments in WDM targets. Free electron laser facilities like FLASH at DESY in Hamburg [2] will be available
to deliver such radiation. Alternatively, pump-probe experiments are also planned at GSI Darmstadt using the
future FAIR facility [3].

Pioneering pump-probe experiments on warm dense beryllium have been performed at the Laboratory for
Laser Energetics with the Omega laser in Rochester. They were successful in spectrally resolving the non-
collective (particle) scattering characteristics of beryllium [4] and carbon [5]. Recently, it has been shown [6]
that important plasma parameters such as electron density and temperature can be inferred from the collective
scattering feature (plasmons) of the measured dynamic structure factor.

Therefore, a detailed analysis of the dynamic structure factor S (k, ω) in WDM states is needed in order to
account for strong correlations and scattering processes between the particles which determine the damping of
excitations processes [7, 8]. Time resolved measurements on ultra-short time scales would offer the possibility to
study non-equilibrium states, e.g. different electron and ion temperature and the relaxation into thermodynamic
equilibrium, see [9, 10, 11, 12].

We present an approach describing a plasma consisting of electrons and ions having different temperatures.
In order to calculate the static structure factor S (k) for dense beryllium plasma we solve an Ornstein-Zernike-
like equation using a hypernetted chain (HNC) closure relation. Effective pair potentials are used to account for
quantum effects. Results are compared with classical as well as quantum corrected Debye model calculations of
Gregori et al. [9]. Especially, non-equilibrium situations with different electron and ion temperatures which are
relevant on short time scales are studied motivated by the recent experiment [6].

2 Theory

The rigorous way to describe a multi-temperature plasma is to start from the BBGKY hierarchy [13, 14, 15, 16].
We are interested in the two-particle distribution function which allows, in principle, to calculate most of the
physical quantities, e.g. pressure or internal energy. Here, we are especially interested in the structure factor, in
order to interprete the scattering results.

We consider a homogenous and isotropic system where binary interactions Vab and the two-particle distribu-
r2 of the two particles only. In absence of external forces

tion function Fab depend on the distance r12 = r1
the equation of motion for the two-particle distribution function Fab reads

where indices a, b, and c denote the plasma species. The quantities nc are the particle densities, and Fabc
is the three-particle distribution function, which itself couples to higher-order functions. One has to ﬁnd an
approximation to truncate equation (1).

As mentioned before we are interested in a model of the plasma, where each species c is described within a lo-
cal equilibrium with temperature Tc. This is possible if the momentum relaxation for particles of the same species
is faster than for particles of different species. This fact is, for example, fulﬁlled having mass ratios far away from
one between different species. Then the momentum distribution separates into a product of independent Maxwell
distributions with temperature Tc. For the two-particle distribution function Fab one gets

Fab (r12, p1, p2) = gab (r12) Fa (p1) Fb (p2)

with Fa (p1) = exp
the inverse temperature. Higher-order distribution functions are deﬁned likewise. Using this ansatz in equation (1)
yields

equation (3), to integrate over the momenta. Therefore equation (3) is multiplied by p1/ma and by p2/mb,
respectively, yielding two equations. Performing the integration over the momenta for each equation results in

In order to solve equation (9) a closure relation is needed, connecting the direct correlation function cab to the

to a multi-temperature plasma by the same way described above, i.e. introducing the mass-weighted temperature

3 Results and Discussion

We have considered a two-component beryllium plasma consisting of electrons and ions with an effective charge
state Z. For the description of the interactions Vab there exist numerous effective pair potentials, e.g. see [24, 25,
26, 27]. For all these potentials, the main goal is to incorporate short-range interactions to avoid divergencies
which result from the behaviour of the Coulomb potential Vab (r12) = (qaqb) / (4πε0r12) at zero distance. In
classical schemes, this problem may be solved by hard-sphere-like potentials. An improvement is given by using
pseudopotential theory as known from solid state physics. In a ﬁrst simple step we apply quantum mechanics by
evaluating the two-particle Slater sum Sab. One gets an effective potential Vab, see Morita [28], via

Sab (r12) = exp (

βabVab (r12)).

For the electron-ion interaction one has to exclude the effect of bound states. We applied in the subsequent

calculations a potential derived by Klimontovich and Kraeft [29] (a simpliﬁed version of their equation (42))

where ξei = (qeqiβei) / (4πε0λei). In this potential, only the ground state of a bound electron is excluded.
Both the Kelbg potential (14) and the Klimontovich-Kraeft potential (15) are ﬁnite at zero distance. The equa-
tions (12), (13), (14), and (15), derived for thermal equilibrium, are generalised to a two-temperature situation by
replacing the temperature T with the mass-weighted temperature Tab as explained in section 2. The interaction
potentials Vab are displayed in ﬁgure 1.

We calculated the ionic structure factor Sii within the formalism derived in section 2. For the description of the
electron-electron and ion-ion interaction we used the Kelbg potential (14). Because we found the Kelbg potential
not applicable for the electron-ion interaction in that low temperature region, we applied the Klimontovich-Kraeft
potential (15). Results for the ionic structur factor Sii are shown in ﬁgure 2 versus the wave number k for a
1023 cm−3, and ﬁxed electron temperature
beryllium plasma with charge state Z = 2.5, ion density ni = 1.21
Te = 12 eV. We compare calculations for different ratios of electron Te and ion Ti temperature. Also shown are
results by Gregori et al. [9] and for the Debye approximation for a pure ionic system, Sii (k) = k2/

In contrast to the present paper, Gregori et al. [9] did not use the HNC equations, but generalised the screened

to the Debye result. Our calculations show a small but nevertheless non zero value at k = 0. With increasing

indicating long range polarisation effects. With increasing k the function increases slower showing no peak and
turning into a Debye-like behaviour.

Concerning the temperature dependence there is a common trend in the results of the present work and those
of Gregori et al. [9]. With decreasing ion temperature Ti, the value of the ionic structure factor Sii for small k is
lowered. This can be attributed to a weakening of the correlations between the electrons and ions. The system is
approaching towards a one-component plasma (OCP) with static ions in a screening background. Within the HNC
calculations this leads to a sharper and stronger peak. The occurrence of such structures in our calculations is a
progress in the description of multi-temperature plasma resulting from the inclusion of higher-order correlations,
see for comparison [23].

Debye result are shown with dashed and dotted lines, respectively.

For the speciﬁc experiment [6], the ionic structure factor at k = 0.54 a

−1
B is of interest. For Thomson scattering
at a wavelength of λ = 0.42 nm, the k value corresponds to a scattering angle of θ = 40o, i.e. forward scattering.
For this k value the ionic structure factor Sii is considered as function of the ion temperature Ti and of the charge
state Z in ﬁgures 3 and 4, respectively. Figure 3 shows, for this small k value, a systematic decrease of the
structure factor for decreasing ion temperature. The absolute values however are model dependent.

The dependence on the charge state is plotted in ﬁgure 4 for Te = Ti = 12 eV. The curves look similar to
ﬁgure 3. This can be understood easily keeping in mind that a lower ion temperature as well as an increased
charge number Z are connected with a stronger coupling of the ions in the system.

4 Conclusions

We have calculated the static structure factor S (k) for solid-density beryllium consisting of electrons and ions.
Effective pair potentials were used to include quantum mechanical corrections. We studied non-equilibrium
situations for a two-temperature plasma. In this case a mass weighted temperature occurs. We ﬁnd a strong
inﬂuence of correlations on the static structure factor compared with simpler approaches such as the Debye
model with quantum mechanical corrections of Gregori et al. [9] and the classical Debye model. Therefore, the
correct treatment of all correlations in a two-component plasma is crucial for the description of non-equilibrium
states and their relaxation into equilibrium. A consistent derivation especially of the effective electron-ion and
ion-ion potentials, is, of course, needed and remains the subject of further work, e.g. accounting for ﬁnite size
corrections.

Abstract

Electron motion in an oblique shock wave is studied by means of a one-

dimensional, relativistic, electromagnetic, particle simulation code with full

ion and electron dynamics.

It is found that an oblique shock can produce

electrons with ultra-relativistic energies; Lorentz factors with γ >∼ 100 have

been observed in our simulations. The physical mechanisms for the reﬂection

and acceleration are discussed, and the maximum energy is estimated.

If

the electron reﬂection occurs near the end of a large-amplitude pulse, those

particles will then be trapped in the pulse and gain a great deal of energy.

The theory predicts that the electron energies can become especially high at

certain propagation angles. This is veriﬁed by the simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Electron acceleration has been an important issue in plasma physics and astrophysics. In

solar physics, for instance, the acceleration of electrons as well as of ions has received a great

deal of attention; in solar ﬂares, gamma rays with energies of several tens of MeV, which are

emitted by the bremsstrahlung from the high-energy electrons, are often observed [1], [2]. In

astrophysics, much more energetic electrons have been discussed. From the observations of

X-rays and gamma rays, it is now believed that electrons with energies up to ∼100 TeV are

produced by a shell-type supernova remnant SN 1006 [3], [4]. It is also believed that in the

Crab Nebula high-energy electrons accelerated up to ∼100 TeV are produced by the pulsar

wind [5]. Theories based on the Fermi acceleration model have been proposed to account for

these high-energy phenomena [6], [7]. As for laboratory plasmas, in an attempt to realize

plasma-based accelerators, the electron acceleration in a relativistic space charge wave has

been intensively studied by simulations and experiments [8].

Ion acceleration in a magnetosonic wave has been studied by many authors [9]- [22].

In a single-ion-species plasma, the large positive potential formed in the shock region can

reﬂect some ions and give great energies to them [9]- [18]. In a multi-ion-species plasma

such as space plasmas, some of the majority ions (hydrogen) can also gain energies by

the same mechanism. Furthermore, the transverse electric ﬁeld in the shock wave can

accelerate all particles of all kinds of (minority) heavy ions to nearly the same speed [19],

[20]. In addition, in a turbulent plasma where particles can interact with many diﬀerent

large-amplitude magnetosonic pulses, some energetic ions can be further accelerated by

a diﬀerent mechanism [21]. These processes have been extensively studied by theory and

particle simulation by many authors and have been applied to the production of high-energy

particles in solar ﬂares and interplanetary shocks [9]- [20].

Strong electron acceleration in shock waves, however, has not been shown by particle

simulations. In this paper we will theoretically and numerically study electron motion in

a magnetosonic shock wave propagating obliquely to a magnetic ﬁeld. We will show that

2

an oblique shock can produce ultra-relativistic electrons. The preliminary result has been

reported in Ref. [23].

In Sec. II, we outline some basic properties of oblique shocks. In Sec. III, we theoretically

discuss the possibility of electron reﬂection. If electrons are reﬂected near the end of the

main pulse, then after the reﬂection they can have great energies in the main pulse.

Several authors discussed stationary pulse solutions for the nonlinear magnetosonic waves

[24]- [27]. However, if the magnetic ﬁeld is rather strong so that ωce/ωpe

>∼ 1, where ωce

is the electron cyclotron frequency and ωpe is the plasma frequency, or if the amplitude is

quite large, then the pulse propagation is not perfectly stationary [13], [14]; small-amplitude

ﬂuctuations are generated in and around the main pulse. Even though the potential is

positive in the main pulse in a shock wave, the electron reﬂection studied in this paper can

occur in such a non-stationary pulse.

In Sec. IV, we estimate the maximum energy of a reﬂected electron and discuss its

dependence on plasma parameters. In Sec. V, we further study the electron acceleration by

using a one-dimensional (one space coordinate and three velocity components), relativistic,

electromagnetic, particle simulation code with full ion and electron dynamics.

It will be

shown that some electrons can be reﬂected near the end of the main pulse and are trapped

in the shock region. In the simulations, an appreciable number of electrons have energies

γ > 100, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Further, we will examine the dependence of γ on the

propagation angle and shock speed. It is veriﬁed that, as the theory predicts, there are special

angles and shock speeds at which the electron acceleration is especially strong. Our work is

summarized in Sec. VI. In Appendix A, we describe relations among physical quantities in a

magnetosonic wave. In Appendix B, we give a rough estimate for the magnitude of parallel

electric ﬁeld Ek on the basis of a simple physical picture.

II. VELOCITIES AND FIELDS IN AN OBLIQUE WAVE

We consider a magnetosonic wave propagating in the x direction with a speed vsh in

an external magnetic ﬁeld in the (x, z) plane. We assume that the ﬁeld quantities depend

on x only; ∂/∂y = ∂/∂z = 0. Then, from the equation ∇ · B = 0, it follows that the

x component of the magnetic ﬁeld is constant, Bx = Bx0. The other components By and

Bz are functions of x, and in the pulse region By as well as Bz can have ﬁnite values. In

the wave frame where the time derivatives are zero (∂/∂t = 0), the electric ﬁeld in the y

direction is constant, Ey = Ey0, and Ez is zero. Hence we have B = (Bx0, By, Bz) and

E = (Ex, Ey0, 0). In Sections II-IV, theoretical analyses will be made mainly in the wave

frame.

The velocity of the guiding-center position of an electron, vg, may be written as

vg = (B/B)vk + vd,

with vd being the drift velocity

vd = cE × B/B2 − (cµ/e)(B × ∇B)/B2.

Here c is the speed of light, −e is the electron charge (e > 0), vk is the velocity parallel to

the magnetic ﬁeld, and µ is the magnetic moment

with me the electron mass and v⊥ the gyration speed perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld.

In the far upstream region, we have no ∇B-drift. Also, the z component of the velocity

averaged over all the electrons in a small volume element must be zero, hvgz0i = 0; the

subscript 0 refers to the quantities in the far upstream region. Accordingly, from the z

component of Eq. (1) we have the average parallel velocity

in the wave frame (see Fig. 1). Also, because hvgx0i = −vsh, the x component of Eq. (1)

gives

Thus Ey0 is related to the shock speed vsh through

vsh = −

hvk0i −

Ey0 = −vshBz0/c.

(5)

(6)

For the deﬁniteness, we assume that Bx0, Bz0 and vsh are all positive; and thus Ey0 < 0.

The nonlinear wave theory tells us the wave structure. A shock wave will have a positive

electric potential ϕ(x). The quantities ϕ, Bz, ni, and ne have similar proﬁles [28]- [29] (see

Appendix A); here ni, and ne are the ion and electron densities, respectively. On the other

hand, Ex and By are proportional to the x derivatives of these quantities; for instance,

Ex = −∂ϕ/∂x. These relations among the quantities are obtained for small-amplitude

waves. In the following theoretical analysis, we assume that the relations are also valid for

large-amplitude waves. As we will see later in Fig. 7, simulation results also support this

assumption.

We denote by xm the x position at which the potential takes its maximum value; hence,

Ex(xm) ≃ 0 and By(xm) ≃ 0. For later use, we also note that the quantity Bz/B takes its

maximum value at x = xm; that is, if Bz(x) is smaller than Bz(xm), then

Bz(xm)2
x0 + Bz(xm)2 >
B2

Bz(x)2
x0 + By(x)2 + Bz(x)2 .
B2

(7)

This can be proved by the following equation

Bz(xm)2
x0 + Bz(xm)2 −
B2

Bz(x)2

x0 + By(x)2 + Bz(x)2 =
B2

[Bz(xm)2 − Bz(x)2]B2
x0 + Bz(xm)2][B2
[B2

x0 + Bz(xm)2By(x)2
x0 + By(x)2 + Bz(x)2]

. (8)

Because Bz(xm) is the maximum value of Bz(x), the term [Bz(xm)2 − Bz(x)2]B2

x0 is positive.

Hence the right-hand side of the above equation is positive.

We know the stationary, ﬁnite-amplitude solutions for perpendicular waves [24]- [27]. The

stationary solitary wave solution is valid when the magnetic ﬁeld is weak, ωce/ωpe << 1, and

5

when the wave amplitude is not large, 1 < M < 2, where M is the Alfv´en Mach number;

M = vsh/vA with vA the Alfv´en speed, v2

A = B2

0/(4πnimi). Simulations and experiments

show that large-amplitude pulses can propagate nearly steadily, even when the amplitudes

are large or the magnetic ﬁelds are strong. Oblique pulses can also propagate nearly steadily.

As the magnetic ﬁeld becomes stronger or the wave amplitude is increased, non-stationary

eﬀects will become important [13], [14].

III. ELECTRON REFLECTION

Because the potential is usually positive in the shock region, some of the ions can be

reﬂected when they go up the potential. As we will see later, electrons can also be reﬂected;

its mechanism is, however, diﬀerent from that of ion reﬂection. We give a physical picture

Here we have used the relation Ez = 0. The velocity v includes gyro, parallel, and drift

of the electron reﬂection.

From the nonrelativistic equation of motion for an electron

motions.

We deﬁne length s as

where vgx is the x component of the electron velocity

(see Fig. 2). Thus ds/dt is given by

ds = (B/Bx0)vgxdt,

vgx = (Bx0/B)vk + vdx,

(13)

We can interpret ds as an inﬁnitesimal length along the ﬁeld line corresponding to the length

dx = vgxdt; ds = (B/Bx0)dx . In general the guiding-center velocity vg is not parallel to

the magnetic ﬁeld B. Hence the guiding center does not move along the ﬁeld line. For a

stationary, one-dimensional problem (∂/∂t = 0 and ∂/∂y = ∂/∂z = 0), all quantities depend

only on x. As a result, for any stationary function f (x) we have

f (x)(B/Bx0)dx =

(14)

where s1 and s2 are the positions along the same ﬁeld line; their x positions are x1 and x2,

respectively.

If we deﬁne quantity F as

then with the aid of (11) and the relation Ek = E · B/B, we have

which can be written as

Using the electric potential ϕ and the vector potential A (B = ∇ × A), we ﬁnd

The quantities ϕ and Bz have similar proﬁles, while By is proportional to ∂Bz/∂x [28], [29].

Hence Az and F have proﬁles similar to ϕ.

Fl = −

then for a stationary, one-dimensional problem, that is, for a case where wave proﬁles can

One can readily show that it is related to F in the wave frame as

where γsh is deﬁned as

F = γshFl,

γsh = (1 − v2

sh/c2)−1/2.

In Appendix B, we give a rough estimate of the maximum value of F , Eq. (B9), found from

qualitative physical considerations.

Combining Eqs. (10) and (18), we eliminate ϕ

mev2/2 − mev2

0/2 = e(F − F0) − (eEy0/Bx0)(Az − Az0 +

vyBx0dt).

(24)

Z

By virtue of the deﬁnition of Az, (19), and the relation dx = vxdt, this equation can be

written as

mev2/2 − mev2

0/2 = e(F − F0) + e(Ey0/Bx0)

(vxBy − vyBx0)dt.

(25)

Z

Then, using the z component of the equation of motion, we ﬁnd

mev2/2 − mev2

0/2 = e(F − F0) − mec(Ey0/Bx0)(vz − vz0).

In the drift approximation, the kinetic energy can be expressed as

mev2/2 = me(v2

k + v2

d)/2 + µB.

(20)

(21)

= (me/2)(v2

d0) + µB0 + mec(Ey0/Bx0)vz0 − eF0.

(28)

With the aid of the z component of Eq. (1), we can eliminate vgz and obtain the following

equation

(me/2)(vk − vrv)2 + K = e(F − F0) − µ(B − B0)

+ (me/2)(v2

k0 + v2

d0) − mec(Ey0/Bx0)(vdz − vz0) − (me/2)v2
d,

where vrv and K are deﬁned as

If we eliminate Ey0 by substituting Eq. (6) in Eq. (30), vrv can be expressed as

vrv = −cEy0Bz/(Bx0B)

(> 0),

K = −mev2

rv/2

(< 0).

vrv = vshBz0Bz/(Bx0B).

We will see below that the velocity vgx is reversed when vk = vrv. In the pulse region, the

quantity e(F − F0) can be much larger in magnitude than the other terms on the right-hand

side of Eq. (29) (see Appendix B). We denote the left-hand side of Eq. (29) by Ee, i.e.,

Ee = (me/2)(vk − vrv)2 + K. As shown in Fig. 3, at a ﬁxed point x, Ee has its minimum

value K when vk = vrv. It is negative in the region

0 < vk < 2vrv.

(33)

Because vdx = cEy0Bz/B2, it follows from Eq. (12) that vgx = 0 if vk = vrv. As can be

seen from Eq. (4), most of the electrons have negative parallel velocities in the far upstream

region. Accordingly, we suppose that the initial parallel velocity is negative, vk < 0.

If

vk gradually increases and exceeds vrv at a certain position, then the x component of the

guiding center velocity, vgx, changes from negative to positive values there, i.e., it is reversed.

9

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

As an electron moves, i.e., as x changes, the quantities K, F , B, etc. also vary. At any

point x, K is the minimum value of the left-hand side of Eq. (29). If there is a region where

the values of the right-hand side of Eq. (29) become smaller than K, then the electron

cannot enter there; it will be reﬂected. We recall that ϕ, F , and Bz have similar proﬁles

and that at x = xm the quantity (Bz/B) has a maximum value [see Eq. (7)]. Because K is

proportional to (Bz/B)2, it will be quite small (|K| is large) around the point x = xm, and

F is large. In front of or behind the main pulse, F is relatively small and K is relatively

large; e(F − F0) could be smaller than K. Thus, if the electron reﬂection occurs, it will be

in such regions.

In quasi-perpendicular shocks, where (Bz0/Bx0) >> 1, vrv is large. Hence K has large

negative values. Thus the electron reﬂection in this mechanism will be diﬃcult.

Figure 4 shows a schematic diagram of the trajectory of guiding center. Here it is assumed

that the reﬂection takes place at point D; the dotted line shows the orbit of a passing electron.

As an electron moves from point A to C, it moves to the negative y direction because of the

Ex × Bz drift. It gains kinetic energy ∆E1 from the electric potential

At the same time, it loses energy ∆E2 because of the electric ﬁeld Ey0

∆E1 = eϕ(xC) − eϕ(xA)

(> 0).

∆E2 = −eEy0(yC − yA)

(< 0).

The net change in the energy is therefore

∆E = ∆E1 + ∆E2.

(34)

(35)

(36)

Even though the magnitudes of ∆E1 and ∆E2 are quite large, they almost cancel when an

electron moves with drift approximation; in particular, in a perpendicular pulse they have

exactly the same magnitude and ∆E = 0 [30]. However, if an electron is reﬂected and moves

from D to E, then it would gain energies from both Ex and Ey0. As a result, the increase in

energy is

10

∆E = ∆E1 + ∆E3,

where ∆E3 is deﬁned as

∆E3 = −eEy0(yE − yA)

(> 0).

IV. ESTIMATE OF ENERGY INCREASE

Next, we will obtain the maximum energy of a reﬂected electron. Because it can have

quite high energy, we will use the relativistic equation of motion

me

d(γv)
dt

= −e

E +

 

v × B

,

c !

where γ is the Lorentz factor. For the stationary, one-dimensional system being considered,

this can be integrated to give the energy conservation equation

meγc2 − meγ0c2 = e(ϕ − ϕ0) − eEy0

vydt.

Z

This is a relativistic form of Eq. (10). Again, using the quantities F , Az, and the equation

of motion, we can rewrite Eq. (40) as

meγc2 − meγ0c2 = e(F − F0) − mec(Ey0/Bx0)(γvz − γ0vz0).

If we deﬁne quantity h as

then from Eq. (41) we have

h = mec2 − mevshBz0vz/Bx0,

γ = [e(F − F0) + h0γ0]/h.

Equation (42) indicates that h is positive if Bz0/Bx0 is of order unity. If Bz0/Bx0 is much

greater than unity, then h can be negative. In addition, Eq. (43) shows that, if the initial

value of h is positive, h0 > 0, then h is always positive in the region where (F − F0) is

positive.

11

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

We show in Fig. 5 schematic diagram of the function [e(F − F0) + h0γ0]. We suppose

that F has a maximum value at x = xm and has a minimum value right behind the main

pulse. If the reﬂection occurs, it would be in this dip, as suggested in the previous section.

The reﬂection point will be denoted by xr. In the top panel this function e(F − F0) + h0γ0 is

always positive. In the second one it becomes negative right behind the main pulse; however

its maximum value is positive (h0 can be either positive or negative). In the bottom one

it is always negative. For the present acceleration mechanism, the top panel is the most

important; the strong acceleration takes place in this case.

Such dips would not be present in the perfectly stationary solutions [24]- [29]. In large-

amplitude magnetosonic waves, however, non-stationary dips can be generated [13], [14].

We here just assume that there is a dip behind the main pulse and discuss its eﬀects on

particle orbits.

First we consider the top panel in Fig. 5: An electron with positive h0 is reﬂected at a

certain point near the end of the main pulse. We will show that, after the reﬂection, h has

its minimum (positive) value at x = xm; hence γ has its maximum value there.

As mentioned earlier, the parallel velocity vk is already positive when an electron is

reﬂected, i.e., when vgx is reversed, even if its initial value is negative. After the reﬂection,

vk will be increased by the (positive) parallel electric force. Because Ek changes its sign at

x = xm, vk will have a maximum value at x = xm (unless vx changes to negative values again

before reaching the point xm ). The parallel velocity will become the dominant component in

the electron velocity, v ∼ vkB/B. The quantity Bz/B as well as ϕ and Bz has a maximum

value at this point. Thus vz, which can be approximated as vz ∼ vkBz/B, will also have the

maximum value there. Because h0 and (Fm − F0) are both positive, h is positive at x = xm.

In addition, Eq. (42) indicates that h decreases (draws closer to zero) as vz increases. Hence,

h of a reﬂected electron will have a minimum positive value at x = xm. Its energy γ will

therefore have a maximum value there. If h can be close to zero, then γ would become quite

large.

If Bx0 is small and vz0 has a large positive value, then h0 becomes small (can be even

12

negative). We now consider such particles; the second panel in Fig. 5. Also in this case,

vz will have larger values after the reﬂection; thus h will decrease. At the reﬂection point

in the dip, the quantity [e(F − F0) + h0γ0] is negative. Consequently, h(xr) < 0. If the

reﬂection occurs, the electron would move in the positive x direction. Because vz increases,

h will further decrease. Hence, the particle would never be able to penetrate the region

again where hγ > 0. The strong acceleration in this mechanism, therefore, will not take

place.

Next, we consider a case where the quantity [e(F − F0) + h0γ0] is always negative (the

bottom panel in Fig. 5). Then, h is always negative. If the reﬂection occurs at x = xr,

then |h| would increase while |e(F − F0) + h0γ0| would decrease. Hence, even if the particle

reaches the point xm, γ would not have an extremely large value. Therefore, the strong

acceleration is not expected.

We can estimate the maximum value γm in the wave frame by substituting the maximum

value of F , Eq. (B12), in Eq. (43). The maximum γ in the laboratory frame can be obtained

by the Lorentz transformation as

γlm = γsh(1 + vxvsh/c2)γm ≃ γshγm.

Now let us consider a case where h becomes quite small, h ≃ 0, at x = xm. There the

electron speed would be close to the speed of light c. Hence, roughly, we have vz ∼ cBz/B.

The quantity h can then be expressed as

h = mec2

1 − γsh

c

Bz
B

tan θ

,

(cid:19)

where tan θ = Blz0/Blx0. Here we have used the relations Bz0 = γshBlz0 and Bx0 = Blx0.

Because Bz becomes quite large in the shock region, we may put as Bz/B ∼ 1. Equation

(45) then suggests that the electron energy can become extremely large when

or, equivalently

γsh(vsh/c) tan θ = 1,

c cos θ = vsh.

V. SIMULATION STUDIES

A. Simulation Method

We further study the electron acceleration by using a one-dimensional (one space co-

ordinate and three velocity components), relativistic, electromagnetic, particle simulation

code with full ion and electron dynamics [31]. The total system length is Lx = 4096∆g

for most of the simulation runs, where ∆g is the grid spacing. All lengths and velocities in

the simulations were normalized to ∆g and ωpe∆g, respectively, where ωpe is the spatially

averaged plasma frequency.

We use a bounded plasma model. The plasma is limited to the region 400 < x < 3696.

The particles are specularly reﬂected at x = 400 and at x = 3696. The radiation leaving the

plasma region is absorbed in the vacuum regions, 0 < x < 400 and 3696 < x < 4096. Thus

the electromagnetic interactions between the two plasma boundaries through the vacuum

regions are made negligibly small [12].

In most of the plasma region, i.e., in 500 < x < 3696, each particle species initially has

a uniform density and has a Maxwellian velocity distribution function. In the small region,

400 < x < 480, the plasma density is four times as high as that in the main region. That

is, the initial plasma density can be written as

ne = 4n0

for 400 < x < x1,

ne = 4n0 exp[−(x − x1)2/(2d2)]

for x1 < x < 500,

ne = n0

for 500 < x < 3696.

Here x1 = 480 and d = 12.

In the high-density region, 400 < x < 480, particles have

shifted Maxwellian velocity distribution functions with average velocity vps; fj ∼ exp[−(v −
vps)2/(2v2

T j)], where the subscript j refers to particle species. These particles act as a

piston. They push the neighboring particles and excite a shock wave. We can change the

shock strength by changing the magnitude of vps; the velocity vps is perpendicular to the

14

external magnetic ﬁeld so that no particles have extremely large parallel speeds initially.

More detailed description about the simulation code can be found in Ref. [12].

The simulation parameters are as follows. The number of simulation particles is Ni =

Ne = 262, 144. The ion-to-electron mass ratio is mi/me = 100. The ratio ωce/ωpe is

ωce/ωpe = 3.0 in the far upstream region. The electron and ion thermal velocities are

vT e/c = 0.38 and vT i/c = 0.01, respectively. The Alfv´en speed is vA/c = 0.3. The electron

skin depth is c/ωpe = 4∆g. The time step is suﬃciently small, ωpe∆t = 0.02, so that ∆t is

much smaller than the plasma and cyclotron periods even in the shock region. As in the

theoretical model, the external magnetic ﬁeld is in the (x, z) plane, and waves propagate

in the x direction.

B. Simulation Results

First, we study a shock with the propagation angle θ = 45◦; i.e., Bx0 = Bz0. Figure 6

shows proﬁles of Bz in the shock wave at various times. Here, the magnetic ﬁeld is normalized

to Bz0. The Mach number is observed to be M = 2.3, i.e., the shock speed is vsh = 2.3vA.

The maximum value of Bz is 4∼5 times as large as Bz0. The main pulse propagates nearly

steadily. However, the proﬁle is not perfectly stationary.

Figure 7 displays ﬁeld proﬁles at ωpet = 680; here the magnetic and electric ﬁelds are

both normalized to B0. As the theory predicts [28], [29], Ey and Bz have similar proﬁles,

while Ex, Ez, and By are quite small in magnitude at the point where Bz has its maximum

value. Figure 8 shows phase space plots of electrons at ωpet = 680. In the shock region,

ultra-relativistic electrons are produced. The maximum value of Lorentz factors is γ ≃ 130.

We also see that px and pz have greater values than py, which is consistent with the picture

that the parallel velocity is dominant in the motion of high-energy electrons. From Figs. 7

and 8, we see that some electrons are reﬂected near the end of the main pulse and that the

high-energy electrons are present in the shock region.

Figure 9 shows proﬁles of Ek, F , and the electric potential ϕ at ωpet = 650 and at

15

ωpet = 680. The quantities ˜F and ˜ϕ denote eF/(mec2) and eϕ/(mec2), respectively. The

quantities F and ϕ were obtained in the simulation by the following equations

As mentioned earlier, roughly speaking, the parallel electric ﬁeld Ek is positive in the region

where ∂Bz/∂x and ∂F/∂x are negative. It is negative in the region where they are positive.

Comparing the plots at diﬀerent times, we see that the wave proﬁles are not perfectly

stationary. They vary with time with small-amplitudes. In particular, as shown in the plot

at ωpet = 680, F sometimes becomes negative near the end of the main pulse, where the

electron reﬂection can take place.

Next, we will study trajectories of electrons; we will ﬁnd that it is the reﬂected electrons

that gain great energies. Figure 10 displays time variations of (x − vsht), y, z, and γ of

electrons in a shock with vsh = 1.75vA; (x − vsht) is the x position in the wave frame. The

lengths are normalized to the electron skin depth c/ωpe. (Here the system size is a half of

that in the previous run; the other parameters such as Ne/Lx are the same.) Two typical

examples are presented here. The thick lines show an electron that was accelerated, and

the thin lines represent an electron that was not accelerated; even the low-energy electron

here has energy γ ≃ 10 in the shock region and γ ≃ 5 behind the shock. In all of the four

panels, the low- and high-energy electrons both have small-amplitude, cyclotron oscillations

with short periods, ωpet <∼ 20; note that the cyclotron period depends on γ as well as the

ﬁeld strength B. At the same time, the accelerated electron has a large-amplitude, long-

period oscillation with period ωpet ≃ 170; it begins when the particle enters the shock,

ωpet = 180, and continues until the end of this simulation run.

(Simulations show that

this period increases with γ. To observe this oscillation as many times as possible, we have

chosen here the case where γ is not so large.) For comparison with Fig. 4, we show the

times corresponding to points B, C, D, and E. From the long-period oscillation of (x − vsht)

16

in the top panel, we see that the electron that will become high energy is reﬂected and then

trapped by the shock wave. On the other hand, the quantity (x − vsht) of the low-energy

electron keeps decreasing, which means that this particle passes through the shock region

without strong interactions. The second panel shows that the y position of the accelerated

electron also oscillates, while the third one shows that z increases rapidly after the reﬂection.

The average value of velocity vz over the period from ωpet = 220 to 400 is vz/c ≃ 0.6, and

the value of vz at maximum γ is vz/c ≃ 0.8. The maximum γ in the bottom panel is γ ≃ 40.

By the Lorentz transformation of these data, we can ﬁnd v and B in the wave frame.

At the time and position of maximum γ, they are v = c(0.27, 0.13, 0.95) and B =

B0(0.70, 0.16, 2.56). This conﬁrms our statement in the previous section that vk is the

dominant component in v there; i.e., vz ≃ vkBz/B.

According to the theory, (47), electron energies can be extremely high at some angles

and shock speeds. To examine this prediction, we have carried out several simulations with

diﬀerent values of the propagation angle θ, keeping other parameters unchanged; Lx =

4096∆g, ωce/ωpe = 3.0, and vsh ≃ 2.1vA. Figure 11 shows the maximum value of γ as a

function of the propagation angle θ. Here the electron energy takes the highest value at the

angle θ ≃ 52◦. For these simulation parameters, Eq. (47) predicts that γ takes a peak value

at θ ≃ 53◦. Thus the theory and simulation are in good agreement. Further, we carried out

simulations with diﬀerent values of the shock speed vsh; the propagation angle is ﬁxed to be

θ = 45◦. Figure 12 shows the maximum value of γ as a function of the shock speed vsh. The

observed values have a peak at vsh/c ≃ 0.7. For these parameters, Eq. (47) predicts that γ

takes large values for vsh/c ≃ 0.71. Again, the theory and simulation are in good agreement.

We have studied electron motion in a shock wave propagating obliquely to a magnetic

ﬁeld. First, we analytically discussed electron motion in an oblique shock wave.

It is

17

pointed out that, if an electron is reﬂected near the end of a large-amplitude pulse, it would

gain a great deal of energy from the electric ﬁeld formed in the wave. The condition for

the reﬂection is then examined. Further, the maximum energy of a reﬂected electron is

estimated, and its dependence on plasma parameters is discussed. Next, we investigated the

shock evolution and associated electron acceleration by using a one-dimensional, relativistic,

electromagnetic, particle simulation code with full ion and electron dynamics. It was shown

that an oblique shock can produce ultra-relativistic electrons; Lorentz factors with γ >∼ 100

have been observed. As the theory predicts, at certain propagation angles electron energies

become extremely high. The electron reﬂection and resultant acceleration takes place when

the wave amplitude is large and the magnetic ﬁeld is rather strong, ωce

>∼ ωpe.

In the present paper, strong electron acceleration has been demonstrated. As future

work, it would be desirable to develop further the quantitative theory for large-amplitude

oblique waves. The evaluation of the electric ﬁeld strength along the magnetic ﬁeld will be

especially important, which will enable us to estimate the maximum energy more accurately.

From the view point of nonlinear wave propagation, motion of trapped electrons and their

eﬀects on the wave evolution are also quite interesting.

APPENDIX A: RELATIONS AMONG QUANTITIES

We here describe relations among the physical variables, using the approximation appro-

priate for low-frequency magnetosonic waves with small amplitudes (for the details of the

calculations, see Ref. [29]). We assume quasi neutrality, n ≃ ni ≃ ne and use the following

stretched variables

expansion

The relations (A6) and (A7) are valid, even when the wave proﬁle is not soliton-like.

APPENDIX B: MAGNITUDES OF Ek AND F

For a nonrelativistic, small-amplitude oblique magnetosonic wave, the electric ﬁeld par-

allel to the magnetic ﬁeld, Ek, has been analytically obtained [32]. However, for a large-

amplitude wave, it will be quite diﬃcult to obtain Ek in a rigorous manner. Here, on the

basis of a simple physical picture, we will give a rough estimate of the parallel electric ﬁeld

Ek in a relativistic, large-amplitude, oblique shock wave. Further, by using it, we will obtain

the maximum value of the quantity F .

We consider in the wave frame.

In the ﬂuid model, the equation of motion may be

written as

mj

d(γjvj)
dt

= qjE + qj

vj × B
c

.

19

(B1)

Here the pressure term is neglected. The subscript j refers to ions j = i or electrons j = e.

The time derivative d/dt is deﬁned as

d
dt

=

∂
∂t

+ vj · ∇ .

We denote by b the unit vector along the magnetic ﬁeld. Then multiplying Eq. (B1) by b,

we have

mj

d(γjb · vj)
dt

− mjγjvj ·

= qjEk.

db
dt

Let t1 be the time when a ﬂuid element is at the leading edge of the shock (the location

where the shock proﬁle begins to sharply rise) and t2 be the time when it is at the point

xm; xm is the location where the electric potential and magnetic ﬁeld take their maximum

values. Then, integrating from t1 to t2, we ﬁnd for the ions

mi(γi2b2 · vi2 − γi1b1 · vi1) − mihγivii · (b2 − b1) ≃ eEk

(B4)

∆
|hvixi|

.

Here the bracket indicates the mean value over the time period (t2 − t1), and ∆ is the

shock width. We have a relation (t2 − t1) ≃ ∆/|hvixi|. For oblique shocks, ∆ will be of

the order of the ion inertial length, ∆ ≃ c/ωpi. The velocity at time t1 is vi1 = −vshex,

where ex is the unit vector in the x direction. The velocity vix will be slowed down by

the longitudinal electric ﬁeld. Thus vix2 will be smaller in magnitude than vix1. Because

Bz is large at the point xm and By(xm) ∼ 0, the unit vector b2 is nearly parallel to the z

direction. Consequently, the inner product (b2 · vi2) will be quite small; here we neglect the

z component of vi2. Since the x component of b1 is given by Bx0/B0, we have

mi(γi1vsh + hγivixi)Bx0/B0 ≃ eEk∆/|hvixi|.

This gives the strength of the parallel electric ﬁeld as

eEk ≃

miv2
sh

|hvixi|

.

Because |vix| is smaller than vsh, the range of |hvixi| is expected to be 1/2 <∼ |hvixi|/vsh <

1, except maybe for extremely strong shock waves.

In fact, if we assume a simple time

(B2)

(B6)

dependence of vix

20

vix = −vsh[1 − a1(t − t1)/(t2 − t1)]

for

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2,

(B7)

with a1 a constant (0 ≤ a1 ≤ 1), then, after integrating over time, we have hvixi = −vsh(1 −

a1/2).

The Lorentz factor for the ﬂuid ion will be close to unity. Accordingly, for instance, if

the ion ﬂuid velocity vix is decreased to a value ∼ −vsh/2, then the value of the content in

the parentheses would be about 1/4.

The electron speed will be ∼ vsh when the electrons encounter the shock and will be close

to the speed of light when they are at the point xm. If we assume that the electron velocity

is nearly parallel to the ﬁeld line in the shock region, then (v · db/dt) can be neglected.

Hence we have

me(−γe2c + γe1vshBx0/B0) ≃ −eEk(t2 − t1).

(B8)

The second term on the left-hand side, γe1vshBx0/B0, can be neglected compared with the

ﬁrst term γe2c. The ions and electrons will have nearly the same time period (t2 − t1) to

keep charge neutrality. Substituting Eq. (B6) in (B8) yields

γe2 ≃

mivsh

.

At x = xm, vz can be estimated as vz ≃ −cBz/B (for reﬂected electrons the sign is reversed).

For a large-amplitude shock, the ratio Bz/B is an order-unity quantity there. The quantity

h deﬁned by Eq. (42) is obtained as

If we average Eq. (43) over electrons in a small volume element, we have

Here we used the relation hvz0i = 0. If electrons have the velocity vz ≃ −cBz/B at x = xm,

then we ﬁnd the maximum value of F from Eq. (43) as

h2 ≃ mec2[1 + vshBz0/(cBx0)].

hhγi = e(F − F0) + mec2hγ0i.

e(Fm − F0) ≃ h2γe2 − mec2hγ0i.

21

(B9)

(B10)

(B11)

(B12)

In many practical cases, we can take hγ0i to be order unity.

Roughly speaking, the quantity e(Fm − F0) is of the order of micvsh. It is, therefore,
T e (∼ µB) and drift kinetic energy mev2

much greater than electron thermal energy mev2

(∼ mev2

Abstract

We report experimental results of proton– and electron–beam–induced near–infra-
red (NIR) ﬂuorescence in high–pressure Xe gas at room temperature. The inves-
tigated wavelength band spans the range 0.7 ≤ λ ≤ 1.8 µm. In the previously
unexplored range for λ > 1.05 µm we have detected a broad continuum NIR ﬂuores-
cence at λ ≈ 1.3 µm that shifts towards longer wavelengths as pressure is increased
up to 1.5 MPa. We believe that this continuum is produced in a way similar to the
VUV continua of noble gas excimers and that the pressure–dependent shift can be
explained by the interaction of the outer electron of the excimer with the gas.

Key words: Xe, excimers, infrared ﬂuorescence.

1 Introduction

Excited states of rare gas atoms are produced easily by means of several
techniques, including electric discharges, irradiation with ionizing particles, or
resonance lines [1,2]. Experimental studies of deexcitation processes allowed
to shed light on the potentiality of rare gases as sensitive media in ionizing
particle detection [3] and as media for high energy electronic transition lasers
[4]. The ability to eﬃciently convert electron kinetic energy to electronic exci-
tations and to rapidly convey the excitation energy to lower–lying atomic and
excimer levels leads excited dense rare gases to emit a considerable fraction of
the released energy in a narrow band in the vacuum–ultraviolet (VUV) range
[5].

Beside the emission stemming from atomic transitions, a great deal of
work has been devoted to the VUV continuum radiation related to transitions
between excited states and the repulsive ground state of neutral diatomic rare–
gas molecules. Several studies of either particle–beam– or laser–induced VUV
ﬂuorescence, including time–resolved spectroscopy, have contributed to clarify
the kinetics of collisional deactivation of excited atomic levels leading to the
formation of rare–gas excimers and to the population inversion required for
VUV lasing [6–19].

VUV ﬂuorescence in particle–excited emission spectra of dense noble gases
is also exploited for direct and proportional scintillation for high–energy par-
ticle detection [3]. The emission in the VUV range is produced by several
reactions between ionized, excited, and neutral gas atoms and free electrons
leading to excimers which decay radiating the VUV continua. At moderately
high pressures (P > 100 Pa) this kind of emission is believed to dominate over
all other types of radiative decay including atomic emission [14].

Much less attention has been devoted to possible infrared (IR) or near-
infrared (NIR) emission, which might be related to transitions between excited
states of the rare–gas dimers, because eﬃcient lasers in these wavelength bands
can be accomplished by much easier means. However, the current improve-
ments in photomultiplier and semiconductor detector technology and the fact
that the NIR emission can be treated with standard optical components make
the NIR emission worth to be accurately investigated as a further promis-
ing tool to complement the VUV scintillation for the detection of ionizing
radiation and to possibly enhance the energy resolution of detectors [20,21].

Among rare gases, Xe is one of the most used species in detectors, both
in the gaseous and in the liquid state. In spite of this, little spectroscopic
information is available for NIR emission involving either higher excited ex-
cimer levels or excited atomic levels, and only VUV light is used for detection

2

purposes.

Two issues have been mainly investigated in Xe. On one hand, there are
studies on the pressure dependence (up to ≈ 1 MPa) of atomic transition lines
in the 828 − 1084 nm band [22,12,13]. This band has been investigated in
order to study the deactivations reactions of the state–selectivelly photoexcited
5p5 [2P3/2] 6p levels of Xe, which involve radiation and collisions with ground
state Xe atoms. These states are of particular importance for understanding
the dominant energy pathways in excimer lasers. In fact, they are the primary
products of dissociative recombination of molecular ions and decay towards
states belonging the 6s manifold [11]. Further collisions of excited atoms in
the 6s manifold with ground state (1S0) Xe atoms lead to the formation of the
u ) (in the scheme of Hund’s coupling case c) excimer states (or 1,3Σu
0+
u , (1u, 0−
in the notation where spin–orbit coupling is neglected) [23]. The decay of these
states towards the repulsive molecular ground state 0+
g ) gives origin to
the ﬁrst and second VUV continua.

g (1Σ+

On the other hand, intense transient absorption bands induced in Xe by
short electron beam pulses have been detected in the region 1.0 − 1.1 µm
[2]. These bands are broader than atomic absorption lines appearing in the
same region and have been thus attributed to bound–bound transitions be-
tween diﬀerent excimer levels. Namely, one of the observed bands (called ﬁrst
absorption) is believed to correspond to the vibrational structure related to
u (3Σu) of the A6s conﬁgura-
the transitions between the excimer states 1u, 0−
tion (related to the excited 5p56s atomic state) and the 2g, 1g, 0+
g (3Πg) of the
A6pπ conﬁguration (related to the atomic 5p56p state) [24]. This suggests that
radiative decay takes place prior to the vibrational relaxation of the excited
molecule.

In contrast to the other noble gases, Xe does not show, in the explored
range [2], a second absorption band at longer wavelengths. This may be asso-
ciated with both a bound-free transition between the bound 0+
u ) excimer
state of the A6s conﬁguration and the (possibly) dissociative 0+
g ) state
of the A7pσ conﬁguration, and with a bound–bound transition between the
0+
u (1Σ+
u ) and the 1g (1Πg) excimer states. This last absorption band should
also show vibrational structure [2].

g (1Σ+

u (1Σ+

It is therefore worth investigating the possibility of NIR emission from
particle–excited Xe gas at high pressure in order to ascertain the feasibility
of new scintillation detectors based on a simpler optics than VUV detectors.
But it is also interesting to investigate possible alternative routes of the neu-
tralization of the rare–gas dimer ions rapidly formed in three-body collisions
to excimer levels diﬀerent from the lowest ones in a situation where the large
collisional frequencies will establish thermal equilibrium among the rotational
and vibrational degrees of freedom on a time scale much shorter than the

3

relaxation of the electronic states [25].

We have thus carried out measurements of NIR ﬂuorescence in Xe gas
at room temperature in the spectral region 700 − 1800 nm at pressures up to
≈ 1.5 MPa, corresponding to a gas density N ≈ 5×1026 m−3. The ﬂuorescence
has been induced by irradiating the gas sample with pulsed beams of either
≈ 5 MeV protons or ≈ 70 keV electrons. We have detected an intense and
broad band centered about 1300 nm, which shows unexpected properties as a
function of the gas density. Here we report the ﬁrst results obtained.

2 Experimental Details

The experimental technique is based on the analysis of the NIR spectrum
emitted by a gas sample irradiated with an ionizing particle beam. In our ex-
periment, we have measured the response of a gaseous Xe sample excited by
either an electron– or proton beam. In the ﬁrst case, electrons are produced
by a home-made ≈ 70 keV electron gun described elsewhere [27]. The elec-
tron bunches have a duration of ≃ 35 ns and contains approximately 0.1 − 1
nC charge. In the proton case, a 5 MeV, 1 nA continuous beam is extracted
by a van de Graaf accelerator (at INFN-LNL laboratories) and chopped into
bunches 50 through 400 µs long. The chopper frequency is ≈ 100 Hz. A sim-
pliﬁed schematics of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The Xe sample

is kept at room temperature inside a cylindrical stainless-steel chamber. The
chamber is previously evacuated down to about 10−5 mbar and then ﬁlled with

4

gas. The nominal impurity content (mainly O2) is ≈ 1 part per million. The
ﬁlling pressure is measured by a pressure transducer (SuperTJE, Sensotec).
The density is calculated by means of a standard equation of state [28].

The particle beam enters the chamber through a suitable window (20 µm
thick Fe window for protons, 8 µm thick Kapton window for electrons). The
emitted light exits the cell through an opposite quartz or sapphire window.

The emitted light spectrum is recorded and analyzed by a Fourier trans-
form infrared spectrometer (Equinox55, Bruker Optics). The light exiting the
interferometer is detected by a InGaAs photodiode with a sensitive area of 75
mm2 (C30723G, EG&G) and quantum eﬃciency > 60 % in the 950 − 1600
nm range. The scheme of the electronic read-out of the photodiode is reported
in Fig. 1. A similar but smaller InGaAs photodiode (GAP3000, Germanium
Power Device) collects a fraction of the NIR light at the entrance of the spec-
trometer, just in front of the interferometer, for normalization purposes. Both
photodiodes are kept at room temperature.

The electronic board controlling the movable mirror of the interferome-
ter (TC20, Bruker Optics) and the read-out circuits of both photodiodes are
connected to a personal computer equipped with an high-speed 16 bit A/D
converter (PAD82, Bruker Optics). Since the particle bunches are too fast to
take a complete interferogram in one single shot, we use the so-called step-scan
technique. The mirror is moved, step by step, in the interval between two con-
secutive bunches. The signals of the two InGaAs detectors are digitized and
stored by the computer. The ﬁnal interferogram is obtained by sorting the
large area photodiode data as a function of the mirror position. The signal of
the smaller photodiode is used to weight the interferogram with the integrated
light intensity in order to get rid of ﬂuctuations of the particle beam intensity
during the experimental run. Moreover, several acquisitions are stored for each
mirror position in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

The acquisition range is usually set between 5000 and 15000 cm−1. The
resolution ranges between 50 and 100 cm−1. The interferogram-to-spectrum
conversion is performed by the OPUS 3.03 system software (Bruker Optics).
The spectrum is then weighted by the quantum eﬃciency of the detector.

The acquisition system has been calibrated by means of an infrared laser-
diode (PGAS1S03/S, EG&G). An Al2O3(Ti) sample has been irradiated in
this experimental setup and its well-known laser emission spectrum has been
obtained [29].

We have to ﬁnally note that the signal–to–noise ratio is not very high for
several reasons, mainly because not many photons are emitted for each particle
bunch and the statistics is therefore quite small. Moreover, the background
noise level of the InGaAs detectors is pretty large since they cannot be cooled

3 Experimental Results

Time–integrated emission spectra were obtained from 0.1 up to ≈ 1.5 MPa
at room temperature. The corresponding gas density range is approximately
(0.3 < N < 5) × 1026 m−3. In ﬁgure 2 we show a typical NIR emission spec-
trum from high–pressure proton–beam excited Xe gas at P = 0.35 MPa. The
spectra obtained with an electron–beam are similar. The most important fea-

ture of this spectrum is the central, largely unstructured, continuum centered
about λ ≈ 1300 nm, which was not revealed before. In the ﬁgure we have
framed in boxes the regions where atomic 6p − 6s decay lines [13] and the
(possible) excimer 3Σu →3 Πg absorption bands [2] were previously observed.
It cannot be ruled out the possibility that some lines might be obscured under
such a broad continuum.

A wavelength λ = 1300 nm corresponds to an energy diﬀerence ≈ 0.95 eV,
i.e., of the right order of magnitude for electronic transitions in diatomic rare–
gas molecules [23]. This fact and that the emission spectrum in this range

is a continuum suggest that the broad NIR peak might be associated with
a transition from a bound excimer level (possibly endowed with vibrational
structure) to a dissociative state of lower energy diﬀerent from the repulsive
Xe2 ground state. This hypothesis would agree also with the observation that
there is no emission at wavelengths shorter that the ﬁrst and second VUV
continua [1]. Moreover, a semiquantitative analysis of the potential energy
curves of Xe suggests that such processes could result in emission in the 2000−
3000 nm region [24].

Upon increasing the gas pressure, the NIR continuum shifts to longer
wavelengths. In ﬁgure 3 the spectra recorded at four diﬀerent pressures are
shown as a function of the inverse wavelength λ−1.

In order to give an estimate of the density–dependent red–shift of the

by ﬁtting a Lorentzian curve to the the observed spectra. The error bars in the
ﬁgure are the statistical uncertainties of the ﬁt. The position of the maximum
shifts linearly with density towards the red wing. In any case, the maximum
shift observed amounts to ≈ 10 %, well in excess of the experimental accuracy.

A similar shift has been observed in the same density range for the second
VUV continuum in Xe [1]. However, in that case the maximum relative shift of
the emission peak amounts to ≈ 1% and is comparable with the experimental

gases (for instance Kr and Xe in the wavelength range 118 − 150 nm) exhibit
a weak density dependent red shift, of the order of 0.1 % in a density range
much larger than the present one, which is interpreted in terms of density
dependent local ﬁeld corrections in the classical dispersion theory [26] .

It can be clearly noted from ﬁgure 3 that also the peak width is aﬀected
by pressure. Namely, the NIR continuum broadens as P increases. In ﬁgure 5

corresponds to an energy spread of ≈ 0.1 eV and increases up to ≈ 0.3 eV at the
high density boundary of this experiment. This amount is too large to be due
to thermal ﬂuctuations only (≈ 0.025 eV at room temperature). Moreover, the
increase of ∆ is not linear with N. Therefore, a simple assumption of collisional
broadening might be not completely adequate. Under this respect the observed
behavior is opposite to that of the second VUV continuum. In fact, in the latter
case the FWHM decreases almost linearly by ≈ 15 % in the same pressure
range of the present experiment. The narrowing of the VUV continua with
increasing pressure has been explained in terms of a hypothetic absorption in
a ground state population that increases with increasing pressure. This fact
would also be responsible for the red shift of the wavelength of the emission
maximum [1].

4 Discussion

Owing to the similarities and diﬀerences of the NIR emission continuum
with the observed VUV continua we would like to suggest a possible model
for understanding the present experimental results.

The wavelength band of the NIR emission is centered about 1300 nm. This
value roughly corresponds to the energy diﬀerence between the stable excimer
u , 1u, 2u of the A7dπ conﬁguration, correlated with the Xe (1S0) +
levels 0±
Xe∗(5p5[2P3/2]6p) dissociation limit, and the energy level of the Xe (1S0) +
Xe∗(5p5[2P3/2]6s) system. According to Mulliken [24], the latter system may
give origin, among others, to short–distance excimer potential energy curves,
which are mainly dissociative in nature. Namely, there are the mainly repulsive
energy curves of the states 0+
g ) of the A7pσ excimer conﬁguration and
the repulsive energy curves of the excimer states 1g, 2g belonging to the B6s
conﬁguration. The latter ones intersect the potential energy curves of the
stable A7dπ excimers.

g , (1g, 0−

We therefore assume that excited Xe atoms belonging to the 6p manifold
can be deactivated to lower–lying excited Xe atoms in the 6s manifold not
only through direct atomic transitions but also via the formation of highly
excited excimers Xe∗∗
2 . These, in turn, decay radiatively to the dissociative
states (1g, 2g), or to the mainly dissociative states 0+
g ), leading to
dissociation into a ground–state Xe atom and one excited Xe atom in the 6s
manifold. Finally, excited Xe atoms in the 6s manifold give origin to the lower
lying excimer levels responsible for the production of the well–known VUV
continua. The NIR emission may originate from high vibrationally excited
levels directly populated, or from relaxed vibrational levels populated through
collisional processes [30].

g , (1g, 0−

The nature of the bound excimer levels of the A7dπ conﬁguration is pre-
dissociative owing to the intersection of their potential curves with those of the
dissociative states [23]. This should produce a further increase of the width of
the NIR band in addition to the usual collisional broadening. Moreover, at the
temperature of the experiment several rotational degrees of freedom should be
excited, too [25].

The most important feature of the observed NIR continuum is its large
density–dependent red shift. It is well known [30] that the electronic structure
of homonuclear excimers can be described quite accurately by an ionic molec-
ular core and an electron in a diﬀuse Rydberg orbital much larger in diameter
than the internuclear distance [2]. Such a state can exist even in a high pres-
sure environment provided that the Rydberg electron is weakly scattered by
the gas atoms, or, in other words, if the electron mean free path is much larger
of the radius of the orbit of the Rydberg state. In a pretty dilute gas, like in
the present experiment, this condition is fulﬁlled because the electron mean
free path is several nanometers long [31].

In order to simplify the discussion, let us therefore treat the excimer levels
with the aid of the Bohr model of a hydrogen–like atom in the same way as
Wannier–Mott excitons are dealt with in liquids or solids [32]. The excimers
can be considered as impurities in the gas and their highest excited states are
given by the equation [32]

En = −

13.6
n2K 2

(1)

where n is the principal quantum number and K is the dielectric constant
of the gas. The energy is expressed in eV. Eq. (1) is valid provided that the
electron orbit is suﬃciently large as to encompass several atoms of the gas.

However, if the radius of the orbit of the Rydberg electron is pretty large,
the interaction of the outer electron with the atoms of the host gas gives origin
to a density–dependent shift of the electron energy. This phenomenon aﬀects
the absorption lines of alkali vapors immersed in a buﬀer gas [33]. The energy
shift depends on the ordinal number of the spectral lines of the series and
converges to a limit, V0(N) proportional to the density of the buﬀer gas. This
limit has been calculated by Fermi [33] as

V0(N) =

2π2

m

Na

(2)

where m is the electron mass and a is the scattering length for the interaction of
the slow, Rydberg electron with an atom gas. The energy levels of the highest

10

excited states must be then corrected for this contribution yielding [32]

En = −

13.6
n2K 2 +

2π2

m

Na

(3)

For attractive electron–atom interaction potential a < 0 and V0(N) gives
origin to a density–dependent red shift of the spectral lines [33].

Let us furthermore assume that the excimer decays to a lower–lying, ex-
cited atomic level of Xe, whose energy levels can be approximated by the same
Bohr equation Eq.(1). The Bohr formula does indeed give an ionization energy
of 13.6 eV to be compared with the actual value of 12.1 eV for atomic Xe.

The correction V0 has been included only in the energy levels of the excimer
because it is assumed that the orbit of the electron in the less excited atom
is smaller. On the contrary, the correction due to the gas polarizability is
accounted for in the same way. Obviously, the validity of these approximations
will depend on the agreement with the experimental data.

The energy released in the transition from the excimer level to the atomic

one corresponds to a wavelength λ given by

where nf and ni are the principal quantum numbers of the ﬁnal and ini-

constant of Xe can be obtained by the usual Lorentz–Lorenz formula but,
in the density region of interest, it can be approximated, within 0.02 %, by
K = 1 + Nα/ǫ0 where α = 4.45 × 10−40 F · m2 is the atomic polarizability of
Xe [34].

Actually, the value of the quantum numbers ni and nf are not known,
the 6s electron in the Xe atom gives origin to four non–degenerate states
1P1, 3P0,1,2, and there are also vibrationally excited states of the excimer.

where we have exploited the fact that the electron–Xe atom scattering length
is negative, a ≈ −0.309 nm [35].

Eq. (6) predicts a linear decrease of the inverse wavelength with increasing
density. Moreover, it contains only one ﬁtting parameter, A, which is obtained
only as the intercept of the straight line at zero density. Once A has been
determined by the ﬁtting procedure, the slope is no longer adjustable because
it only contains additional contributions given by universal constants.

The straight line in ﬁgure 4 has been drawn with slope given by

− (2A(α/ǫ0) + (/mc)|a|) = −1.98 × 10−22 m2

with A ≈ 7800 cm−1, as determined from the zero–density extrapolation of
the data. If a straight line is ﬁtted to the data a slope of value −(2.05±0.09)×
10−22 m2 is obtained. The agreement with the experimental slope is excellent.
We stress once more the fact that as soon as the zero–density value of λ−1 has
been determined, there are no more free parameters left. By neglecting either
the screening of the Coulomb interaction due to polarization or the density–
dependent shift of the energy levels of the Rydberg electron in a large–radius
orbit, the slope of the straight line would become nearly 50 % smaller than
actually measured.

Obviously, the nature of the excimers in the A7dπ conﬁguration is predis-
sociative because their potential energy curves intersect the repulsive potential
energy curves of (1g, 2g) states leading to dissociation in a (1S0) Xe atom plus
an excited one in the 6s manifold. Also the (0±
g , 1g) excimer states of the
A7pσ conﬁguration are mainly repulsive, though their potential energy curves
do not intersect those of the A7dπ excimer states. Therefore, there is a contin-
uum of kinetic energy available to the dissociation products and a continuum
NIR emission band is produced. Nonetheless, the continuum of kinetic energy
is probably distributed around the ﬁnal states in such a way that an average
value for it can be well approximated by Eq. (1). Moreover, the predissociative
nature of the excimer states might be responsible for the non linear increase
of the NIR continuum width. This might also be the reason for the very dif-
ferent behavior of the width of the VUV continuum [1], that decreases with
increasing density. In fact, for the (0+
g transitions there are no
intersections between potential energy curves and the higher excimer states are
not predissociative. However, a quantitative description would require much
more accurate potential energy curves than those actually available.

The assumptions leading to the previously described model could raise se-
vere criticisms. In particular, the radius of the Rydberg electron in the excimer
might not be large enough to guarantee that the energy levels are aﬀected ei-
ther by the dielectric constants or by the Fermi shift V0(N), or both. However,
we believe that the striking agreement of the model with the experimental data
gives some credit to the model itself. Further measurements at higher densities
in Xe are needed (and are in progress) to conﬁrm the ﬁrst data reported here.
Moreover, the investigation of mixtures of Xe with other noble gases with
diﬀerent polarizabilities and diﬀerent V0(N) should help testing the model.

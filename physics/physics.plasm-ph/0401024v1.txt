We demonstrate that 15 µm methanol microdroplets eﬃciently absorb intense femtosecond laser
pulses, resulting in the production of very hot electrons even at moderate intensities. We observe a
hot electron temperature of 36 keV in the droplet at 1014 W cm−2 whereas in solid plasmas three
times higher intensity is needed to produce similar hot electron temperature. Hard X-ray yield from
liquid droplet plasmas is about 250 times more than that obtained from solid plasmas, under similar
conditions. Mie scattering calculations of the intensity distribution inside the droplet, show more
than an order of magnitude enhancement in the incident intensity inside the microdroplet. The
higher yields and temperatures in microdroplets are explained in terms of the geometrical focusing
eﬀects.

The physics of laser plasma interaction has undergone
quite a revolution in recent times. The technological ad-
vances in lasers have opened the possibility of delivering
joules of energy in femtosecond time scales to achieve in-
tensities as large as 1021 W cm−2 [1]. Non-perturbative
physics of laser-matter interaction at these extreme in-
tensities has brought in many new concepts and appli-
cations [2]. Novel schemes of pulsed neutron generation
[3] and nuclear reactions [4], have been demonstrated.
Table top accelerators [5] and synchrotrons [6] are no
longer considered as mere predictions. Hot,dense laser
produced plasmas are a promising source of radiation
both in EUV and x-ray regimes and developing eﬃcient
sources of such radiation is one of the key problems. One
of the main aims of laser plasma interaction studies is
to ﬁnd strategies to eﬃciently couple laser energy into
matter to enhance high energy ion, electron and pho-
ton emission. To this end, introduction of novel target
materials as the recipient of the laser energy has been
very fruitful.Metallic nano particle coated solids [8] and
’velvet’ targets [10] have yeilded enhanced x-ray in the
moderate to very hard x-ray regime. Another example
are clusters which are nanoparticles with solid-like local
density, have been shown to absorb 90% of the incident
laser energy. Particle acceleration upto an MeV has been
achieved in such systems at intensities of 1016 W cm−2.
Eﬃcient nuclear fusion has been demonstrated with the
use of D2 clusters [7].

There are, however some disadvantages in the use of
gaseous cluster systems, one of which is that the kind
of atomic or molecular species that can be used for the
production of large clusters is very limited. As an al-
ternative the use of droplets of liquid as a target has
come under investigation recently. Droplet targets cou-
ple the advantage of size conﬁnement, along with the
ease with which a droplet could be used to introduce

any atomic/ molecular system of interest. The use nano
particle or velvet solid target results in a higher level of
debris which is a problem from application point of view.
Droplet targets have found application in EUV Lithog-
raphy and X-ray microscopy [11] as a debris less source.
EUV radiation source based on droplets are already being
commercially used in Phillips laboratories [12] for Lithog-
raphy. The emphasis on droplet plasma studies has so far
been mostly towards measuring and optimizing the EUV
radiation at 13nm which is the chosen radiation for litho-
graphic purposes. There have been some initial studies
towards measuring hard x-ray radiation [13]. The study
of hard X-ray emission from droplets is even more inter-
esting, given the fact that there is very little hard X-ray
emission from clusters of energy above 5 keV [14].

In this paper, we present experimental measurements
of hard x-ray emission in the range 50-200 keV from 15µm
methanol droplets irradiated with 100 fs laser pulses with
intensities up to 3×1015 W cm−2. We also measure hard
X-ray emission from solid plastic target under similar
conditions for comparison. Even at these moderate in-
tensities, hot electron temperature as large as 40 keV has
been obtained in the case of droplet target. Experiments
with solid plastic target, indicates similar temperatures
at three times higher intensities. The X-ray yield from
the droplet plasma is at least two orders of magnitude
larger compared to that obtained from solids at similar
intensities. At intensities less than 3 × 1015 W cm−2 we
do not observe any measurable hard x-ray emission in
the range of 50-200keV from solid targets. The eﬃcient
hard X-ray emission in droplets as compared to solid has
been explained using Mie scattering calculations.

The microdroplet targets are generated by forcing
methanol through a 10 µm capillary, which is modulated
at 1 MHz frequency using a piezo-crystal. The uniformly
sized droplets were characterized by direct imaging of the
droplet and also by observing morphological dependent
resonances (MDR)[15]. In direct imaging, we illuminate
the drops with a picosecond strobe light and capture an
image using a CCD camera ﬁtted with a 20X microscopic

objective. The inset in ﬁgure 1(a) shows the image of
the droplet along with the image of 25 µm precision slit
used for calibration. In MDR measurements, the droplet
is doped with a dye and the ﬂuorescence spectra is mea-
sured in the direction perpendicular to the incident light.
The light inside the microcavity undergoes total internal
reﬂection and allows only certain modes to propagate
in the cavity depending on the morphology of the cav-
ity. The mode separation in the ﬂuorescence spectra is
shown [15] to give the size of the droplet. The experimen-
tal setup consists of a droplet jet that is injected into a
vacuum chamber, pumped by a 2000 l/s turbo molecular
pump. Cryopumping from a liquid nitrogen cooled coils
is used to augment the pumping to maintain the base
pressures as low as 10−5 Torr. The unused droplets are
pumped out diﬀerentially out of the main chamber. We
focus the laser pulses using a 30 cm planoconvex lens and
achieve intensities of 1015 W cm−2. The laser is triggered
at 10 Hz from a synchronous signal derived from 1 MHz
source. The 1 MHz source also drives the piezo crystal
oscillator, so that droplets stream is temporally synchro-
nized with the laser pulses. Experiments on solid targets
are carried out, using an optically ﬂat plastic target by
focusing the laser pulses with a 20 cm lens to intensities
in the range of 1015 W cm−2. We used the plastic tar-
get since the atomic composition is not too diﬀerent from
that in the methanol droplets. The target is scanned such

that the each laser pulse is incident at a fresh portion of
the target [16]. We used p-polarized light incident at 45◦
to the normal of the target for our experiments with solid
target. The x-ray detection in both the experiments were
carried out with a NaI(Tl) detector appropriately time
gated with the laser pulse and calibrated using standard
radioactive sources.

The x-ray emission spectrum obtained from 15µm
methanol droplets when irradiated with 100 fs laser
pulses to intensity of about 8×1014 W cm−2 is shown
ﬁgure 1 (a). The solid line shows a exponential ﬁt to the
data assuming a Maxwellian distribution for the elec-
trons in the plasma. In this ﬁtting we only considered
data larger that 50 keV so that the corrections due to
the transmission through the glass or aluminum hous-
ing of the NaI detector are negligible. To avoid pile up
in the NaI(Tl) detector, the count rate is kept less than
one per pulse, by restricting the solid angle of detection.
The X-ray emission spectrum for solid target is shown in
ﬁgure 1(b) at three times larger intensity, than that for
liquid droplets. The intensity used in solid target is 3
times more because there is no measurable X-ray emis-
sion below 2×1015 W cm−2. Exponential ﬁt to the data
shows that the hot electron temperature is about 31 keV
which is smaller than 36 keV observed in the case of liq-
uid droplets.

A comparison between the relative integrated X-ray
yields from both droplet plasma and plastic target are
shown in ﬁgure 2. Though the intensity ranges used
in the microdroplet experiments are diﬀerent from those
used with the solid target we can make a comparision of
the yields at an intensity of 2.8×1015 W cm−2 and we
ﬁnd that at this intensity the yeild is larger with liquid

droplet plasma by more than 250 times. Experiments
with higher intensities was not possible in the case of
droplet target since we are limited to use a spot size of
30 µm or more to ensure that the droplet is close to the
centre of the focus, despite the spatial jitter of a few mi-
crons in the jet. From the measured size of the focal spot
and the droplets we ﬁnd that the droplets are exposed to
only (11%) of the incident power. In view of this, the
yield should be compared not as a function of incident
intensity but as a function of the input power being cou-
pled into the system. Figure 3 shows the x-ray yield as
a function of the incident energy in the liquid droplet
plasmas and the solid target. It is very clear that x-ray
emission from liquid droplet is very eﬃcient compared to
the solid target, even at a fraction of the incident laser
power.

Resonance absorption (RA) is one of the important
mechanisms for the production of hot electrons in the
case of solids [17] in our intensity regime. In solids, we
observe that at 3×1015 W cm−2 we get hot electron tem-
perature of about 31 keV. These measurements are con-
sistent with temperatures reported in literature [18]. We
ﬁnd that invoking resonance absorption as a mechanism
for production of hot electrons mearly from the surface of
the liquid droplet, is insuﬃcient to explain the enhanced
yield and temperature. On the droplet surface the angle
of incidence would vary from 0 to 90◦ and accordingly the
polarization would change from s to p, as we go from the
centre to the poles of the drop. If we integrate over the
incident angle we ﬁnd that the fractional absorption due
to resonance absorption is a factor of 3 less than that for
a solid target incident with p-polarization at 45◦. Calcu-
lations show that only 9% of the fraction of the incident

3

intensity would be absorbed by resonance absorption [19]
in the case of droplets. The collisional absorption is also
less than 5% in the case of droplets. Hence it is clear that
at intensities of 8×1014 W cm−2 resonance absorption at
the surface of the droplet target is unable to account for
the enhancement in the X-ray yields and temperature.
So, to explain the higher X-ray yields in the case of mi-
crodroplets we need to invoke other possible mechanisms.
The explanation for the enhancement of X-ray yields
could be due to the enhanced intensities inside the micro-
droplet because of the focusing eﬀect of the droplet [20].
It is expected that incident intensity is enhanced by two
orders of magnitude inside the droplet, when femtosecond
light is used. We numerically calculated the Lorentz-Mie
solution for a plane wave incident on a spherical droplet
to obtain the ﬁeld distribution inside the droplet [21, 22].
Figure 4 shows the calculated relative enhancement in
the intensity distribution inside the liquid droplet with
respect to the incident intensity. The ﬁgure shows bright
focused spots along both the forward and the backward
direction. The focusing of the light into small regions in
the droplet results from constructive interference of the
ﬁeld propagating in the cavity. Focusing of light to nan-
odimensions inside the cavity depends on the size of the
cavity and wavelength of the incident light. The calcu-
lation show an increase in intensity by about 60 times
inside the droplet. These calculations correlate well with
recent experiments which show that even with incident
intensities of 1012 W cm−2, focusing of the light in the
cavity leads to critical density plasma that is hot enough
to emit white light from focused regions [20]. Calcula-
tions in ref.[20] show that at incident intensity of 1014 W
cm−2, plasma with critical density is formed in the early
stages of the pulse and the pulse energy that follows heats
the electrons in the plasma and leads to eﬀective absorp-
tion. The focusing eﬀect leads to energy densities as large
as 3×103J cm−3 and with negligible scattering of the
light, upto 95% of the incident energy is absorbed in eﬃ-
ciently coupling the energy into the plasma. We believe
that this focusing eﬀect of the light is mainly responsi-
ble for the enhanced coupling of the laser energy into the
droplet plasma and eﬃcient emission of hard x-rays in
methanol droplets used in our experiments. Thus the 60
times enhancement in the intensity inside the droplet can
explain the higher yields in the case of droplet plasma
compared to solid targets.
Invoking resonance absorp-
tion with the enhanced intensity and calculation of the
hot electron temperature using scaling laws would mean
that the expected enhancement in temperature is about
a factor of four. It is anticipated that the formation of
critical density plasma at the surface will not allow the
major fraction of the incident energy to enter into the
droplet and the enhancement is therefore less than the
factor of 4.

In these simple calculations, we do not take into ac-
count the changes in refractive index when the plasma

in generated and corresponding changes in propagation
of the light. The analysis requires that for low intensi-
ties used in these experiments, substantial pulse energy
enters into the cavity before a critical density layer is
formed on the droplet surface, and this assumption seems
reasonable in view of the recent experiments and calcu-
lations [20]. The hot regions inside the droplet can form
a high density plasma and couple the laser energy eﬃ-
ciently by resonance absorption, producing hot electrons.
It is however not feasible to compute the contribution of
resonance absorption from these plasma regions as the
polarization is arbitrary and the incident angle is diﬃ-
cult to determine owing to multiple reﬂections from the
droplet surface.

In summary, we have studied x-ray emission from the
hot dense plasma generated by intense laser irradiation of
15 µm methanol droplets in comparison with that from
the solids. Our results show that the yields are larger by
more than two orders of magnitude with droplet plasmas.
Even with 11% of energy incident on the droplet, eﬃcient
x-ray generation is produced from hotter plasma even at

4

intensities <2×10 15 W cm−2. The enhanced eﬃciency is
understood to be due to Mie scattering of the laser light
in the cavity. The droplet acts like a lens and focuses
the light in the initial stage of the pulse to create critical
density plasma of nanodimensions, the pulse energy that
follows couples the laser light into the plasma and heats
the electrons. This eﬃcient coupling of the laser energy
is believed to be responsible for the hotter plasma be-
ing generated with very enhanced x-ray emission yields.
These observation have the potential to improvise and
devise new strategies for eﬃcient production of table-top
pulsed X-ray sources.

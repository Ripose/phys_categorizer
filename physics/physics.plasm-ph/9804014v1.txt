Abstract

The nonlinear evolution of a unstable electrostatic wave is considered for a
multi-species Vlasov plasma. From the singularity structure of the associated
amplitude expansions, the asymptotic features of the electric ﬁeld and distri-
0+
bution functions are determined in the limit of weak instability, i.e. γ
where γ is the linear growth rate. The asymptotic electric ﬁeld is monochro-
matic at the wavelength of the linear mode with a nonlinear time dependence.
The structure of the distibutions outside the resonant region is given by the
linear eigenfunction but in the resonant region the distribution is nonlinear.
The details depend on whether the ions are ﬁxed or mobile; in either case the
physical picture corresponds to the single wave model originally proposed by
O”Neil, Winfrey, and Malmberg for the interaction of a cold weak beam with
a plasma of ﬁxed ions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, we have studied the collisionless nonlinear evolution of an unstable mode; ﬁrst
in a single component Vlasov plasma with ﬁxed ions and then more generally in a multi-
species Vlasov plasma. [1]- [3] The asymptotic features of the problem in the limit of weak
0+ where γ is the linear growth rate, were our principal focus. The
instability, i.e. γ
main tool has been expansions for the amplitude equation and the distribution functions;
in particular the asymptotic structure of these expansions. Coeﬃcients of both expansions
0+ and these singularities reveal the asymptotic features of the
develop singularities as γ
amplitude equation, distribution functions and electric ﬁeld.

The amplitude equation describes the evolution on the unstable manifold of the equi-
librium and a key conclusion of our previous paper established the scaling behavior of this
system. [3] By setting A(t) = γβr(γt) exp(
γt)

0+, provided the exponent β was suitably
and θ(t) were free of singular behavior as γ

chosen. The correct choice turned out to depend on the model under consideration: if ion
masses were ﬁnite, then typically β = 5/2 unless the ion distributions happened to be ﬂat
at the phase velocity of the linear wave. In the limit of ﬁxed ions (mi → ∞
) or when the
ion distributions are ﬂat at the resonant velocity, the exponent drops to β = 1/2.

≡

In this paper we apply these results for β to control and interpret the singularities that
arise in the expansions of the distribution functions. This study illuminates in detail the
asymptotic structure of both the distributions and the electric ﬁeld. In particular, we ﬁnd
that the electric ﬁeld is essentially monochromatic at the wavelength of the linear mode with
a nonlinear time dependence. Outside the resonant region, the distributions are described
by the linear eigenfunction and in the resonant region they have a nonlinear structure. The
details depend on whether the ions are ﬁxed or mobile, but in either case this physical picture
is well known from the “single wave model” proposed by O’Neil, Winfrey and Malmberg for
the interaction of cold weak beam with a neutral plasma of mobile electrons and inﬁnitely
massive ions.. [4] Their work supplied a model of the self-consistent Vlasov problem that
has proven useful to many researchers in the subsequent years. [5]- [12] Our conclusions
generalize this useful simpliﬁed picture to a general electrostatic instability arising in an
unmagnetized multi-species Vlasov plasma. As this paper was being completed, we learned
of the interesting recent work by del-Castillo-Negrete who has given an diﬀerent derivation
of the single wave picture using matched asymptotic methods to treat the resonant and
non-resonant particles. [13] As in the original work of O’Neil et al., del-Castillo-Negrete
allows only mobile electrons and moreover restricts attention to instabilities associated with
so-called “inﬂection point modes”. [14,15]

In the remainder of this introduction we review our notation and in section II we sum-
marize the needed conclusions of Ref [3] regarding the singularities of the expansions. The
third section applies these conclusions to the distributions and electric ﬁeld, and section IV
contains a ﬁnal discussion.

Our notation follows Ref [3]; we consider a one-dimensional, multi-species Vlasov plasma

If the contour in (11) is replaced by the Landau contour for Im(z) < 0 then we have the

II. PREVIOUS RESULTS

The equilibrium F0(v) is assumed to support a “single” unstable mode in the sense
that Eu, the unstable subspace for
, is two-dimensional. With translation symmetry and
periodic boundary conditions, this is the simplest instability problem that can be posed.
Henceforth, let k denote the wavenumber of this unstable mode that is associated with
the root Λk(z0) = 0 which we assume to be simple, i.e. Λ′
= 0. The corresponding
eigenvector is

not required for the present discussion.

The key point is that for both the amplitude equation and the distribution function the

although their character remains the same. The higher coeﬃcients hm,j exhibit more and
0+ and these poles generate
more poles which approach the linear phase velocity as γ

asymptotic behavior for non-resonant and resonant velocities.
In the former regime we
assume the distance from the linear phase velocity satisﬁes v
(1), and the resonant
regime corresponds to velocities within a neighborhood of vp that scales with the growth
(γ). For resonant velocities, the singularities in ψ(v) and hm(v, γ2βr2)

For v

(γ), the functions ψ(v) and hm(v, σ) typically develop singularities as
0+ and these divergences compete with the explicit factors of γ in (34) to determine
γ
the asymptotic form of the distribution. The analysis is simpliﬁed by the fact that all relevant
singularities are poles of the form described in (29), and these may be rewritten as a singular
factor multiplying a nonsingular function of the rescaled velocity variable u

region.

The puzzle is to deduce the correct overall factor of 1/γn for each function. For hm(v, σ)

The generic resonant correction to F0, expressed in the velocity coordinate u, scales overall as
γ3/2; the leading term in this correction has the wavelength of the linear wave but the velocity
dependence, ˆψ(u, γ) + r(τ )2 ˆh1(u, r2, γ), is not simply given by the linear eigenfunction. The
time dependence is determined by the mode amplitude r(τ ) exp(
iθ(t)) but the dependence
on r is rather complicated.

2. Special cases: c1(0) = 0

For the special cases, deﬁned by ﬁxed ions or ﬂat ion distributions, we apply (47) and

(43)-(44) to (34) and obtain

F0(vp + γu)]/γ2 =

This is a qualitatively diﬀerent structure in contrast to (48); now the resonant correction
(γ2) and all wavelengths are present at leading order. Thus the spatial dependence is

very rich and bears no special relation to the linear instability; a similar observation holds
for the dependence on velocity.

Bounds on the asymptotic form of the integrals can be inferred from the expansion hm =

The overall scaling is now the well known γ2 or “trapping scaling” and the leading term has
a much simpler structure. Again we ﬁnd the wavenumber k of the linear instability; however
now the time dependence is simply given by the mode amplitude r(τ ) exp(

iθ(t)).

IV. DISCUSSION

The single wave model, derived originally by O’Neil, Winfrey and Malmberg, described
the interaction of a cold electron beam interacting with a plasma of mobile electrons and ﬁxed
ions. In their problem, the inﬁnite extent of the plasma allowed for continuous wavenumbers
and the dispersion relation for a cold beam was required to select a single wavenumber
corresponding to the maximum growth rate. This wavenumber characterizes the electric
ﬁeld whose nonlinear time development results from the coupling to resonant particles. The
nonresonant plasma simply provides a linear dielectric which supports the wave.

By contrast, we pose a more general problem, allowing for multiple mobile species and not
restricting the type of electrostatic instability, but for a ﬁnite plasma with periodic boundary
conditions. Within this setting, we consider equilibria supporting a single unstable mode
and derive the resulting equations for the electric ﬁeld and distributions in the limit of
weak instability. In this asymptotic limit, the physical picture of the original single wave
model emerges quite generally. The monochromatic electric ﬁeld is coupled to the resonant
particles and evolves nonlinearly while the nonresonant particles show only a linear response
to the electric ﬁeld.

The amplitude expansions, whose singularity structure form the basis of our analysis,
do not provide a practical tool for solving the single wave model. For this purpose, it is
more convenient to assume the simpliﬁcations of the single wave picture and derive model
equations directly from the original Vlasov theory. This development will be presented in a
forthcoming paper. [16]

Abstract. Relativistic quantum plasma dispersion functions are deﬁned and the
longitudinal and transverse response functions for an electron (plus positron) gas are
written in terms of them. The dispersion is separated into Landau-damping, pair-
creation and dissipationless regimes. Explicit forms are given for the RQPDFs in the
cases of a completely degenerate distribution and a nondegenerate thermal (J¨uttner)
distribution. Particular emphasis is placed on the relation between dissipation and
dispersion, with the dissipation treated in terms of the imaginary parts of RQPDFs.
Comparing the dissipation calculated in this way with the existing treatments leads to
the identiﬁcation of errors in the literature, which we correct. We also comment on a
controversy as to whether the dispersion curves in a superdense plasma pass through
the region where pair creation is allowed.

1. Introduction

There is a relatively sparse but diverse body of literature on relativistic quantum
plasma dispersion functions (RQPDFs). Tsytovich (1961) calculated the response of
a relativistic quantum (RQ) electron gas and derived expressions for the real and
imaginary parts of the longitudinal and transverse response functions for arbitrary
isotropic distributions, and for a J¨uttner distribution.
Jancovici (1962) derived
expressions for the real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and transverse
response functions for a completely degenerate electrons gas, providing a relativistic
generalization of the well-known result of Lindhard (1954) for a nonrelativistic
degenerate electron gas. These results were rederived and extended in various ways,
by Hakim and Heyvaerts (1978, 1980) and Sivak (1985), using a Wigner function
approach (Hakim 1978), by Delsante and Frankel (1980) and Kowalenko et al (1985),
who concentrated on the longitudinal response, and by Hayes and Melrose (1984),
who derived general results and Melrose and Hayes (1984), who extended Jancovici’s
(1962) results to the nearly degenerate limit and Tsytovich’s (1961) results to a mildly
degenerate plasma. The response functions were discussed further by Itoh et al (1992)
and Braaten and Segel (1993) in connection with neutrino losses from stellar interiors.
This area is of ongoing interest (Ratkovi´c, Dutta and Prakash 2003; Dutta, Ratkovi´c
and Prakash 2004; Koers and Wijers 2005; Jaikumar, Gale and Page 2005). One of the
neutrino emission processes, the so-called plasma process, is dependent on dispersion and
dissipation in the plasma, and the results of Braaten and Segel (1993) are used. Although
these authors included RQ eﬀects in their formal development, they approximated the
general result, eﬀectively by neglecting RQ eﬀects in the resonant denominator, and
it is their approximate form that is used. We argue that this leads to a misleading
conclusion concerning one-photon pair creation (PC) in a superdense plasma, which
we deﬁne here as plasmas with cutoﬀ frequency (called the plasma frequency by some
authors) exceeding the threshold, 2m, for PC. (We use natural units with ¯h = c = 1.)

Our main purpose in this paper is to discuss the properties of RQPDFs in an
isotropic, thermal RQ electron gas emphasizing the relation between dispersion and
dissipation and the role of PC. One general feature of existing treatments is that the
dispersion and dissipation are treated in diﬀerent ways, with the dispersion described
by appropriate RQPDFs, and with the dissipation calculated directly from the resonant
part of the response function.
In principle, the RQPDFs have imaginary parts that
describe the dissipation, with the relation between the real and imaginary parts
determined by the causal condition (e.g., the Landau criterion). Calculation of the
dissipative part in this way provides a useful consistency check on the expression for the
real part of the response function. Our consistency check fails in two published cases,
and we identify and correct the relevant errors.

There are relatively few applications where the combination of

intrinsically
relativistic and quantum eﬀects is important in a plasma. The extreme conditions
required apply in, for example, the early Universe, quark-gluon plasma and the interiors

of compact stars. In section 6 we discuss possible applications, emphasizing a speciﬁc
point relevant to the plasma process for neutrino emission: whether or not one-photon
PC is possible is a superdense plasma. Earlier authors (Tsytovich 1961, Hayes and
Melrose 1984, Kowalenko et al 1985) assumed that the dispersion curve does pass
through the PC region, so that PC is allowed, and Itoh et al (1992) and Braaten
and Segel (1993) gave arguments against this. Here we show that PC is possible in
a superdense plasma and we determine the conditions under which it can occur.

In section 2 we present general formulae for the response functions and deﬁne
general forms of RQPDFs for isotropic distributions. In section 3 we discuss dissipation,
giving particular emphasis to the boundaries of the regions when Landau damping (LD)
and PC are allowed for a given particle. In sections 4 and 5 we discuss the responses
of a completely degenerate distribution and a nondegenerate thermal distribution,
respectively. We discuss applications in section 6 and summarize our conclusions in
section 7.

2. RQPDFs for isotropic distributions

An isotropic distribution is isotropic in one inertial frame, which is the rest frame of the
medium. The linear response tensor for an isotropic medium may be described in terms
of the longitudinal and transverse response functions. In this section, we start with a
general form for the response tensor, then write down explicit forms for the longitudinal
and transverse response functions, and identify relevant RQPDFs.

2.1. General form for the response tensor

The general expression for the response tensor has been written down in a variety
of diﬀerent forms. We start with a covariant form that is derived by analogy with
the (unregularized) vacuum polarization tensor (e.g., Berestetskii et al 1971), P µν(k),
which relates the Fourier transform in space and time of the linear induced 4-current,
J µ(k), to the 4-potential, Aµ(k), where k denotes the wave 4-vector, [ω, k], constructed
from the frequency, ω, and the wave 3-vector, k. The response 4-tensor satisﬁes the
charge-continuity and gauge-invariance relations, kµP µν(k) = 0, kνP µν(k) = 0. This
form is

P µν(k) = −e2

where nζ(p) is the occupation number, with ζ, ζ ′ = ±1 labeling electron and positron
states, and with

F µν(P, P ′) = P µP ′ν + P ′µP ν + gµν(m2 − P P ′).

The energies are ε = ε(p) = (m2 + |p|2)1/2, ε′ = ε(p′), and ˜p denotes the 4-momentum
with components [ε, p]. The (unregularized) vacuum polarization tensor itself follows
from (1) by neglecting the contribution of the particles (nζ(p) → 0).

2.2. Longitudinal and transverse response functions

Isotropy implies that the response tensor is of the form

P µν(k) = P L(k) Lµν(k, ˜u) + P T (k) T µν(k, ˜u),

(3)

where Lµν(k, ˜u) and T µν(k, ˜u) are longitudinal and transverse projection operators that
depend on the 4-velocity ˜uµ of the rest frame of the plasma. After projecting (1) to
identify P L(k) and P T (k), one may perform the p′ integral over the δ-function, choose
the rest frame and rewrite the p-integral in terms of integrals over ε, ε′:

where the limiting values are

The response functions are unchanged by interchanging electrons and positrons. One
may evaluate the response functions for electrons, and then replace the occupation
number by

Explicit forms for the response functions (neglecting the vacuum contribution) are

˜n(ε) = n+(ε) + n−(ε),

to include the contribution of the positrons.

3. Dissipation

As already noted, in the existing literature it has been conventional to treat dissipation
separately from dispersion, rather than treating it in terms of the imaginary parts of
RQPDFs. Dissipation is possible only when εk, as given by (8), is real: LD applies for
ω2 − |k|2 < 0 and PC for ω2 − |k|2 > 4m2. Before discussing the conventional procedure,
it is useful to identify the energy, momentum and speed of a resonant particle at the
boundary of the allowed regions for LD or PC.

3.1. Limiting values of the resonance condition

In dispersion theory it is conventional to refer to a zero of the denominator (as a function
of ω for ﬁxed k) as a resonance, and to the algebraic condition for such a zero as a
resonance condition. The Landau prescription speciﬁes how one is to integrate around
the associated pole in the integrand in accord with the causal condition, such that each
pole contributes an imaginary part equal to its semi-residue. Dissipation is described by
the contributions from these semi-residues, and diﬀerent poles are interpreted in terms
of diﬀerent dissipation processes. There are two dissipation processes in a collisionless,
unmagnetized plasma, LD and PC.

For given ω, |k|, the limiting values of the resonance condition determine discrete
values of ε, |p|, |v|. These values are found by setting ω − ζε + ζ ′ε′ = 0, squaring twice
to remove the square roots, and setting (p · k)2 = |p|2|k|2. Writing |p| = m sinh χ,
ε = m cosh χ, |v| = tanh χ, t = tanh( 1

2χ), the limiting values must satsify

There is considerable freedom in choosing the four solutions. An obvious choice is
t = ±t+, t = ±t−. Noting that t and −1/t correspond to the same values of ε, |p|, |v|,

one may also choose from t = ±1/t+, t = ±1/t−. With t = t±, the solutions for the

related to the ±-solutions by

with εk given by (8). The solutions (16) are the natural solutions for PC, and they
correspond to the choice t = t±. For LD, the natural solutions are ε = εk ± 1
2 ω,
|p| = ωεk/|k| ± 1
2|k|, and these correspond to t = t− and t = 1/t+, respectively. At a
boundary of the LD or PC region, ε must correspond to either ε±, with ε′
max,min then
corresponding to ε∓, but some care is required in making the speciﬁc identiﬁcations.

3.2. Dissipation due to LD and PC

The resonant terms in (1) correspond to replacing the denominator by −iπδ(ω−ζε+ζ ′ε′),
where the Landau prescription is used. We discuss LD and PC separately.

The terms with ζ = ζ ′ = ±1 describe LD, and these correspond to resonances
at ω = ±(ε − ε′), respectively. On repeating the derivation of the longitudinal and
transverse parts, the double integral over ε, ε′ is reduced to a single integral by this
δ-function, and the limit of integration can be expressed in terms of εk. In this way
Tsytovich (1961) derived imaginary parts that correspond to

Im P L

LD(k) =

dε′′ (4ε′′2 − |k|2)[˜n(ε′′ − 1

2ω) − ˜n(ε′′ + 1

2 ω)],

(17)

LD(k) =

dε′′ (2ε′′2 − 2ε2

k + |k|2)[˜n(ε′′ − 1

2 ω) − ˜n(ε′′ + 1

2ω)],

(18)

in the notation used in this paper.

The resonant part of (1) describes PC for ζζ ′ = −1, but only ζ = 1 = −ζ ′
contributes for ω > 0. The vacuum contributes in this case, and Tsytovich (1961)
retained both the contribution of the vacuum and of the electron gas, but his ﬁnal
expression for the vacuum contribution diﬀers from the well-known result by a factor
of two. We note that the response is invariant under the interchange of positrons and
electrons, which allows one to rewrite 1 − n+(ε) − n−(ε′) in (1) for ζ = 1 = −ζ ′ as
1 − 1

2 ˜n(ε′). Then, repeating the derivation, we ﬁnd

for the imaginary parts due to PC of the longitudinal and transverse responses,
respectively. The unit term inside the square brackets diﬀers by the relevant factor
of two from Tsytovich’s expression.

3.3. Dissipation due to the vacuum polarization tensor

The vacuum polarization tensor is of the form P µν
0 (k) = P0(k)(gµν − kµkν/k2),
where P0(k) is an invariant. The longitudinal and transverse parts are P L
0 (k) =
ω2P0(k)/(ω2 − |k|2) and P T
0 (k) = P0(k), respectively. The real part is negligible for
most purposes involving wave dispersion, but the imaginary part cannot be neglected
when considering dissipation due to PC. An important point is that dissipation due to
PC occurs in the vacuum, and the presence of an electron gas tends to suppress it due
to the Pauli exclusion principle. The imaginary part of the vacuum polarization tensor
is well-known, e.g., Berestetskii et al (1971), and corresponds to

Im P0(k) =

[m2 + 1

2(ω2 − |k|2)]

(21)

for ω2 − |k|2 > 4m2, with Im P0(k) = 0 for ω2 − |k|2 < 4m2. A derivation of (21) using
the approach adopted here leads to (19) and (20) with only the unit terms retained.
The integrals are then elementary and (19) and (20) reproduces the longitudinal and
transverse parts of (21), respectivley.

3.4. Imaginary parts of logarithmic PDFs

Logarithmic functions appear naturally in (9), and more speciﬁcally as RQPDFs for
It is desirable to have a
a completely degenerate electron gas, as discussed below.
prescription that allows one to write down the imaginary part of a logarithmic PDF
directly. Superﬁcially, this seems trivial: when x passes from positive to negative, ln x
may be replaced by ln |x| ± iπ. However, determining the relevant sign is not trivial.

The imaginary part of any PDF may be determined by imposing the Landau

prescription. For a logarithmic PDF, this leads to the generic prescription

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
Hence, to impose the causal condition, one writes a logarithmic function as a sum (or
(cid:12)
diﬀerence) of terms of the form (22) and gives each term an imaginary part, iπ, when
the frequency is in the range ωmin < ω < ωmax.

4. Completely degenerate Fermi gas

The response of a completely degenerate Fermi gas was calculated by Jancovici (1962),
cf. also Hayes and Melrose (1984), Sivak (1985), Kowalenko et al (1985). Jancovici’s
expression for the transverse part of the response tensor contains a spurious factor

ω2/(ω2 − |k|2), which leads to a nonphysical resonance in the dispersion relation for
transverse waves. It also implies incorrectly that the contribution of the electron gas
to dissipation due to LD and PC has the same sign for the transverse response. Here
we start with forms that are valid in the DL region, where the response functions are
necessarily real, and then discuss the extensions into the LD and PC regions.

4.1. Thermal distributions

Before considering the completely degenerate limit, it is appropriate to comment on the
general case of a thermal distribution of electrons, which is the Fermi-Dirac distribution,

˜n(ε) =

1
exp[(ε − µ)/T ] + 1

+

1
exp[(ε + µ)/T ] + 1

,

where the chemical potential, µ, includes the rest energy, m, and where the temperature
is T , with Boltzmann’s constant set to unity. (The form (23) applies for each spin state,
and a factor of two arises when one sums over the two spin states for unpolarized
electrons and positrons.) No general results are known for the RQPDFs for this case.
The completely degenerate limit corresponds to T → 0, µ → εF, when one has

˜n(ε) =

Note that the sign ω/|ω| is needed in the terms involving Λ3F to ensure that the real
parts of the response functions are even functions of ω.

The DL regime corresponds to |k|2 < ω2 < 4m2 + |k|2. In this regime, Λ1F and
Λ2F are positive (they are always real) so their logarithms are real. Due to εk being
imaginary, Λ3F is the ratio of a complex number and its complex conjugate, and hence
its logarithm is imaginary, so that εk ln Λ3F is real. One may write

Although earlier authors, e.g., Kowalenko et al (1985), Sivak (1985), noted that ln Λ3F is
replaced by an arctangent, there are many choices as to how this arctangent is written.
With the choice made in (28) the arctangents χ± remain between 0 and π/2 throughout
the DL range. The choice (29) avoids complications with other choices in numerical
calculations.

4.3. Imaginary parts of ln ΛiF

In order to use the prescription (22), the logarithmic functions must be written in an
appropriate form. Relevant forms for Λ1, Λ2 follow by writing (10) in terms of the
limiting values (4). This gives
(ω − ε + ε′
(ω − ε + ε′

Although Λ3 cannot be rewritten in terms of the factors that appear in (30) and (31),
it can be written in a form similar to (31), with ω replaced by 2εk:

min) or with (ω±ε+ε′

The logarithms of Λ1, Λ2 may be written as a sum of terms of the form (22) by identifying
(ω−ωmax)/(ω−ωmin) with (ω±ε−ε′
max).
Although ln Λ3 cannot be rewritten in terms of these factors, in the neighborhood of
the zeros of any of the factors in (32), the vanishing factor does become of this form.
As only the sign of the imaginary part on crossing the zero is required, this suﬃces to
determine the sign. For example, consider the factor (2εk − ε − ε′
max): this factor is
zero at the boundary of the LD region with ε = εk − 1
2ω, and in the
neighborhood of this boundary the factor may be approximated by (ω − ε − ε′
max), and
treated in the same manner as the corresponding factor in Λ1 or Λ2.

Figure 1. Regions of ω–|k| space (ω > 0) are separated by curves corresponding
to the boundaries of the regions where LD is allowed, ω < |k|, and PC is allowed,
ω > (4m2 + |k|2)1/2. These are further separated into regions (a)–(h) deﬁned for a
completely degenerate electron gas with pF/m = 1.5. For the completely degenerate
gas, LD is allowed only in regions (b) and (c), and there is no dissipation in (a)
and (d), the electron gas completely suppresses PC in (e) and partly suppresses
PC in (f); PC has its vacuum value in (g) and (h). From lower right to upper

ln[(ω ± εF − ε′

factors giving an imaginary part of iπ in the region where the argument of the logarithm

Fmin. In this case, the zero
of ω − εF + ε′
Fmin occurs within the LD region, separating regions (b) and (c) in ﬁgure 1,
and the zero of ω − εF − ε′
Fmin occurs within the PC region, separating regions (e) and
(f) in ﬁgure 1. It is then straightforward to determine the signs of the imaginary parts
in the various regions, and these are listed in table 1.

The imaginary parts of P L(k) and P T (k) may be written down by inspection using
(25) and (26), respectively, and noting the imaginary parts in table 1. These imaginary
parts may also be derived from (17) and (18) by setting the occupation number equal
to unity for ε < εF and zero for ε > εF, and performing the integrals, which are then
elementary. The imaginary part was written down for the longitudinal response by
Jancovici (1962) and Kowalenko et al (1985) and these results are reproduced using
(25) and table 1.

4.4. Alternative forms for Λi

For completeness we note that the logarithmic functions may be written in terms of the
± solutions (14) and (15);

Λ1 =

(t − t+)(t − t−)(t + 1/t+)(t + 1/t−)

.

The boundaries in ﬁgure 1 are identiﬁed as follows: the upper boundary to the PC
region corresponds to tF = −t− (pF = −p−, vF = −v−), the lower boundary of region
(f) corresponds to tF = t− (pF = p−, vF = v−) for |k| > 2pF and to tF = t+ (pF = p+,
vF = v+) for |k| < 2pF; the upper boundary of region (b) corresponds to tF = 1/t+
(pF = −p+, vF = v+), the lower boundary corresponds to tF = −1/t+ (pF = p+,
vF = −v+) for |k| > 2pF and to tF = t− (pF = p−, vF = v−) for |k| < 2pF. Although
useful for some other purposes, these forms are not convenient for determining the
imaginary parts because the frequency-dependence is implicit rather than explicit, and
the prescription (22) cannot be used directly.

5. Nondegenerate thermal distribution

The nondegenerate limit of the Fermi-Dirac distribution (23) applies when µ/T is large
and negative, and then it becomes the J¨uttner distribution,

˜n(ε) = Ae−ε/T ,

A = 2 cosh(µ/T ) =

(34)

π2˜ne
2m2T K2(m/T )

,

where K2 is a modiﬁed Bessel function, and ˜ne is the number density of electrons plus
positrons. (The normalization coeﬃcient, A, is evaluated by setting the integral of ˜n(ε)
over 2d3p/(2π)3 equal to ˜ne, where the factor 2 arises from the sum over the two spin
states.)

According to Melrose and Hayes (1984), in this case the three plasma dispersion
functions S(n)(k) can be evaluated in terms of the RPDF introduced by Godfrey et al
(1975), which they wrote in the form

T (z, ρ) =

is the phase speed, γ = (1 − v2)−1/2, and ρ = m/T is an

inverse temperature in units of the rest energy of the electron (ρ = 1 corresponds
to T = 0.5 × 1010 K). Dissipation is described by the imaginary part of this RPDF:

with T ′(v±, ρ) = ∂T (v±, ρ)/∂v±, γ± = (1 − v2

sign σ± = ε±/|ε±| is needed in the LD region to take account of the fact that ε± can
be negative while γ± = |ε±|/m are positive by deﬁnition. The sign σ± is replaced by
unity in the DL and PC regions. The RQPDFs (37) characterize the response of a
nondegenerate thermal electron gas when RQ eﬀects are included.

The interpretation of v± and γ± is diﬀerent in the LD and PC regimes. In the LD

region one has

v± =

εk ± |k|2/2ω
εk ± ω/2

γ± = (εk ± 1

(38)

with εk deﬁned by (8). In the nonquantum limit, one has εk ≫ ω/2, |k|2/2ω, implying
v± → ω/|k| = z. Then (37) reproduces the known non-quantum limit (Melrose and
Hayes 1984):

S(0)(k) =

[zT (z, ρ) + 2K0(ρ)],

S(1)(k) =

[ − zT (z, ρ) + (1 − z2) T ′(z, ρ) + 2ρK1(ρ)],

(39)

In comparing (37) with (39), it is apparent that the phase speed, z = ω/|k|, in the
nonquantum case is replaced by two functions v± that include the eﬀect of the quantum
recoil, which has opposite signs for emission and absorption. Thus, in the LD region, v±
are interpreted as resonant phase speeds for stimulated emission and true absorption,
which diﬀer due to the quantum recoil, and mγ± are interpreted as the energies of the
electron before and after emission of a wave quantum, respectively. In the PC regime,
mγ± = εk ± 1

2ω are interpreted as the energies of the created electron and positron.

In the DL regime the RQPDFs must be real.

In this case, the v± are complex
conjugates of each other. With σ± = 1 and T (v∗, ρ) = T ∗(v, ρ), the sum over ± in (37)
leads to a real expression, as required.

Comparison of the imaginary parts for the response functions obtained from the
imaginary parts of the RQPDFs with those obtained by imposing the causal condition
directly provides a check on both results. Here the imaginary parts that are to be
compared are those obtained by inserting the imaginary parts of the S(n)(k) into the
expressions (6) and (7) for the longitudinal and transverse response, and those obtained
by evaluating the integrals in (17), (18) and (19), (20) for the nondegenerate distribution
(34). The results agree. In particular, Tystovich (1961) wrote down explict expressions
for dissipation due to LD and PC in a nondegenerate electron gas, which our derivation
reproduces: the spurious factor of two is present only in Tsytovich’s calculation of the
vacuum contribution.

6. Applications

RQ eﬀects become important for dissipation and dispersion in plasmas only under
extreme conditions, such as the early Universe, quark-gluon plasmas and the interiors
of compact stars. The degeneracy condition (temperature less than chemical potential)
is relevant to only the last of these, and we concentrate on this case, emphasizing the
role of PC. First we comment on LD.

LD in the non-quantum limit is possible only for subluminal waves, ω < |k|, and
this is also the case when RQ eﬀects are included. This precludes LD of transverse waves,
which are superluminal. Dissipation and dispersion associated with LD may be treated
nonrelativistic provided not only that the particles are nonrelativistic, but also that the
waves are subluminal. The RQ recoil term changes the classical resonance condition to
ω−k·v±(ω2−|k|2)/2mγ, for emission and absorption, whereas in nonrelativistic theory,
the recoil term is ∓|k|2/2m. The diﬀerence is unimportant for nonrelativistic particles
and subluminal waves, but is important for superluminal waves and for waves with near
vacuum dispersion, ω ≈ |k|. An implication is that the widely used response functions
of Lindhard (1954), which were derived using nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, may
∼ |k|. We are currently investigating this
lead to unreliable results for waves with ω >
point.

The contribution of the plasma process to neutrino emission from the cores of
compact stars depends on the dispersive properties of the degenerate gas, and Braaten
(1991) pointed out that earlier authors, following Baudet, Petrosian and Salpeter (1967),
had used inaccurate forms for the dispersion relations. A controversial point was raised
by Braaten (1991), who criticized the claim by Baudet, Petrosian and Salpeter (1967),
and subsequent authors, that PC needs to be taken into account in suﬃciently hot and
dense plasmas:
if PC is allowed then photons decay into pairs much faster than they
would decay into neutrinos. This point was discussed further by Itoh et al (1992) and
Braaten and Segel (1993), who also concluded that PC is forbidden in a completely
degenerate electron gas. In more recent discussions (Ratkovi´c, Dutta and Prakash 2003;
Dutta, Ratkovi´c and Prakash 2004; Koers and Wijers 2005; Jaikumar, Gale and Page
2005), the approximations of Braaten and Segel (1993) to the dispersion functions have
been used. Our results show that PC is allowed in a completely degenerate electron
gas, and the reason that our results diﬀer from those of these earlier authors can be
understood as follows.

Itoh et al (1992) considered wave quanta at the cutoﬀ frequency, ωc, and argued
that although one can have ωc > 2m in a superdense plasma, the actual threshold for
PC is 2εF, and one cannot have ωc > 2εF. The higher threshold is because all electron
states below the Fermi energy are occupied, and for |k| = 0 the electron and positron
energies are equal. This argument is consistent with our results, but it applies only
at |k| = 0. PC is forbidden in region (e) in ﬁgure 1, and this region shrinks as |k|
increases. A dispersion curve for transverse waves that starts at ωc > 2m for |k| = 0
is necessarily in region (e) for suﬃciently small |k|, but then necessarily enters region

Relativistic quantum plasma dispersion functions

c γ2(1 − ω2

(f), where PC is allowed, before approaching the light line asymptotically. Braaten and
Segel (1993) made approximations to the wave dispersion by neglecting the quantum
recoil: speciﬁcally, if one combines the denominators in (1), the common factor may be
written as (ku)2 − (k2/2m)2, and Braaten and Segel (1993) argued that for practical
purposes one can neglect the (k2/2m)2 term. However, near the cutoﬀ |k| → 0, one has
c /4m2γ2), and their approximation requires ωc ≪ 2mγ,
(ku)2 − (k2/2m)2 → ω2
which is not satisﬁed for all 1 < γ < εF/m in a superdense plasma. This approximation
eﬀectively excludes dispersion due to PC, and it is inconsistent to use it to argue that
PC cannot occur. Our results show that PC does occur over a limited range of |k| in
a completely degenerate electron gas, but not in region (e) in ﬁgure 1, due to exact
cancellation of the vacuum contribution to PC by the electron gas. For a partially
degenerate electron gas, even in region (e) the cancellation is not exact, and PC occurs.
The original argument of Braaten (1991) against PC was based on mass
renormalization of the electron, arguing that this suppresses the cutoﬀ frequency,
keeping it below the PC threshold. We do not comment speciﬁcally on this argument
here. Our conclusion is that the arguments by Itoh et al (1992) and Braaten and
Segel (1993) that neglected mass renormalization do not negate the original argument
of Baudet, Petrosian and Salpeter (1967) that PC needs to be taken into account when
considering the plasma process for neutrino emission in a superdense plasma.

7. Conclusions

In this paper we discuss the properties of RQPDFs for an isotropic, unmagnetized
plasma. The dispersion is related to the dissipation, which includes the familiar Landau
damping (LD), modiﬁed by the quantum recoil, and one-photon pair creation (PC).
It is necessary to treat the dissipation in the LD and PC regimes diﬀerently, and to
interpret them diﬀerently. LD has the same interpretation as in a non-quantum plasma,
except that the resonance at the phase speed, z = ω/|k|, is replaced by resonances at
two speeds, v±, and corresponding energies, ε±, given by (38) and interpreted as the
resonant values for induced emission and true absorption when the quantum recoil is
included. Dissipation due to PC in the electron gas has the opposite sign to LD and
a diﬀerent interpretation: PC exists in the vacuum, due to the imaginary part of the
vacuum polarization tensor (21), and the presence of an electron gas partly suppresses
PC due to the Pauli exclusion principle.

An objective in this paper is to relate dissipation and dispersion by deriving the
dissipation from the imaginary parts of the RQPDFs, which requires that the imaginary
parts be determined explicitly.
In particular, the logarithmic RQPDFs that appear
for a completely degenerate electron gas acquire an imaginary part of ±iπ when their
arguments becomes negative, and a prescription is needed to determine the sign of
this imaginary part uniquely. We start from the DL region, where the imaginary part is
necessarily zero, and analytically continue into the regions where LD and PC are allowed.
We show that the Landau prescription leads to a relatively simple prescription for

Relativistic quantum plasma dispersion functions

identifying the sign of the imaginary part acquired when the argument of the logarithm
changes sign. We compare our results with existing expressions for the imaginary
parts derived in other ways, and ﬁnd agreement provided that some minor errors are
corrected. Speciﬁc errors identiﬁed are a spurious multiplicative factor in Jancovici’s
(1962) transverse response function and a factor of two in the expression derived by
Tsytovich (1961) for the vacuum contribution to dissipation due to PC.

In the absence of any plasma, dissipation due to PC is determined by the imaginary
part of the vacuum polarization tensor for ω > (m2 + |k|2)1/2, and is zero otherwise.
The presence of an electron gas tends to suppress PC, and the presence of a completely
degenerate electron gas can completely suppress PC. Complete suppression at a given
ω, |k| occurs if all potential states for the created electron are below the Fermi level.
Although it was argued by Itoh et al (1992) and Braaten and Segel (1993) that PC cannot
occur in a superdense plasma, where the cutoﬀ frequency exceeds the PC threshold 2m,
we show this is not the case for at least a range of |k| 6= 0. The earlier arguments of
Baudet, Petrosian and Salpeter (1967) on the implications of PC remain valid and need
to be taken into account in detailed analyses (e.g., Jaikumar, Gale and Page 2005).

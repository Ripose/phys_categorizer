Abstract

Experimental results [1] for the reﬂection coeﬃcient of shock-compressed dense Xenon plas-
mas at pressures of 1.6 – 17 GPa and temperatures around 30 000 K using a laser beam
with λ = 1.06 µm are compared with calculations based on diﬀerent theoretical approaches
to the dynamical collision frequency. It is found that a reasonable description can be given
assuming a spatial electron density proﬁle corresponding to a ﬁnite width of the shock wave
front of about 2

10−6 m.

1 Reﬂectivity measurements

Experiments with an explosively driven generator of shock waves to produce dense
nonideal Xenon plasmas were reported in [1]. The reﬂectivity was measured using a
laser system with the wave length λl = 1.06 µm. The results of the experiments are
shown in Tab. 1. The thermodynamic parameters of the plasma were determined from
the measured shock wave velocity. The plasma composition was calculated within a
chemical picture [2]. Working with a grand canonical ensemble [3] virial corrections
have been taken into account due to charge-charge interactions (Debye approxima-
tion). Short range repulsion of atoms and ions (including multiply charged positive
ions) was considered via second and third virial coeﬃcients within a virial expansions.
In the parameter range of the shock wave experiments, derivations of up to 20 % for
the composition have been obtained depending on the approximations for the equation
of state. This is within the accuracy of the experimental values of the reﬂectivity.

It was suggested that the measurement of reﬂectivity allows to determine the con-
centration of free electrons in the plasma. However, investigating these data [1], it was
not possible to ﬁnd a direct relationship between the values of free electron density
ne and the reﬂectivity R. The reﬂection coeﬃcient increases smoothly with the free
electron density. It approaches only slowly values characteristic for metals, although
1021cm−3, where the plasma fre-

quency, ωpl =
ωl of the probing laser pulse, is exceeded even at the lowest density. However, this
critical density is taken from the RPA approximation for the dielectric function in the
long–wavelength limit ǫ = 1
l where total reﬂection occurs due to a vanishing
dielectric function. Taking collisions into account this will be smoothed out. On the
other hand, a sharp boundary between plasma and undisturbed gas in front of shock
wave is assumed.

In [1], the spatial structure of the ionizing shock wave was discussed, showing three
characteristic zones, which may inﬂuence the electromagnetic wave propagation. In a
precursor zone, the gas is heated, but the inﬂuence on the wave propagation is small.
In the region of the shock wave front a steep increase of the free electron density is
expected. The width of the wave front is determined by relaxation processes in the
10−7 m [1], which is one order of
plasma. It was estimated to be of the order d
magnitude less than the laser wave length. Under this condition d/λ
1, the laser
beam reﬂection was assumed to be determined by the electron properties of the plasma
behind the shock wave front. An expression derived from the Fresnel formula in the

In the present work,
improvements in the calculation of the dielectric function as well as considerations
concerning the shape of the wave front will be discussed to ﬁnd a consistent theoretical
approach to the measured reﬂectivities.

2 Reﬂection by a step-like plasma front

In this section, we investigate the reﬂection coeﬃcient at a shock wave front where its

at a step-like plasma front [4]

This is a more general expression than (1) for the reﬂectivity. Assuming that the
transverse dielectric function ǫt(k, ω) is independent of the wave vector k, the integral
(5) can be evaluated leading to the expression (1) given above.

In general, the dielectric function is related to a dynamical, nonlocal collision fre-

which is deﬁned by extending the above deﬁnition (2) to ﬁnite values of the wave
vector k. In recent papers [5, 6], an approach to the dielectric function within a linear
response theory was developed. Diﬀerent approximations have been investigated with
respect to their consistency. Having this in mind, we are able to give a more precise
description of the dielectric function at the plasma parameters considered here.

2.1 Born approximation

Before considering the nonlocal dielectric function below, we discuss the long–wavelength
0, replacing ǫt(k, ω) by ǫt(0, ω) in Eq. (5). In this case, the transverse and
limit k
longitudinal dielectric function are identical. The dynamical collision frequency can
be evaluated in Born approximation with respect to the statically screened potential
(Debye potential), see [5], as (the non-degenerate case is considered)

In the following Tab. 2, the resulting values RBorn
for the reﬂectivity calculated from
the Drude formula (3) with the static collision frequency (8) are compared with the
reﬂectivities RBorn resulting from the dynamical collision frequency in Born approxi-
mation (7) taken at the laser frequency ωl.

dc

Compared with the observed reﬂectivities, the results obtained in Born approxima-
tion are too small. Similar values were also reported in [1]. As well known, the Born
approximation (Faber-Ziman result) underestimates the value of the dc conductivity.
The correct low-density value of σdc is given by the Spitzer formula and can be ob-
tained using a renormalization factor as discussed in [5], see also discussion in Sec. 2.3
below. The use of the dynamical conductivity increases the reﬂectivity by about 15
%, but it also fails to produce the steep dependence of the reﬂectivity on the electron
density as observed in the experiment, see Tab. 1.

2.2 Nonlocal conductivity

The general expression (4), (5) for the reﬂection coeﬃcient contains an integral over the
k dependent transverse dielectric function. We will discuss the eﬀect of the nonlocal
conductivity using the Mermin approximation as given in [6, 8]. The RPA solution is
extended by introducing a complex frequency argument which contains the collision
frequency. The Mermin expression for the dielectric function obeys particle number
conservation. For the transverse dielectric function we obtain [8]

Using the static collision frequency (8), the nonlocal dielectric function was calcu-
lated. The results RMermin,Born
are also given in Tab. 2. There is no essential modiﬁ-
cation if the k-dependence of the dielectric function is taken into account. This can
be explained by the fact that, at the conditions given, the main contributions to the
integral over k come from the region of k
B . A comparison of the mean free
≈
path and the much larger skin depth also shows, that nonlocal eﬀects are not relevant
here. We conclude that neither the account of the dynamical properties of the collision
frequency nor the account of the k dependence in the dielectric function will essen-
tially modify the calculated reﬂectivity.
In particular, the discrepancy between the
calculated and measured reﬂectivity as a function of the electron density, see Tab. 1,
cannot be cured.

2.3 Strong collisions and renormalization

The Born approximation can and should be improved considering strong collisions and
renormalization as described, e.g., in [5]. Restricting ourselves to the static case, we
discuss diﬀerent approximations for σdc. We introduce dimensionless parameters Γ, Θ
characterizing the non–ideality and degeneracy, respectively, of the plasma:

conductivity the intermediate parameter region.

Using the Drude formula (3) with the conductivities σERR

dc we obtain the reﬂectiv-
ities RERR
, see Tab. 3. For comparison, experimental values for the dc conductivity
[10] are given. The ﬁt formula seems to overestimate the conductivity. The results for
the reﬂectivities RRR
dc are rather high, even exceeding the measured values. Obviously,
the size of the calculated reﬂectivities can be shifted considerably according to the
approximations made for the dc conductivity. But the strong increase of the measured
values can not be explained yet.

It is possible to extend the approach given here for the dc conductivity to the
dynamic conductivity, as shown in [5] using the Gould-DeWitt approach. However,
as already shown for the Born approximation, which is part of the Gould-DeWitt
approach, we do not expect a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the density dependence of
the reﬂection coeﬃcient on the electron density. We also do not expect a signiﬁcant
modiﬁcation if the nonlocal, k dependent dielectric function is considered, because
only the long-wavelength limit contributes in calculating the impedance. Furthermore,
within a more accurate treatment the contribution of the interaction with neutral
atoms should be included as well. However, at the temperatures considered here the
inﬂuence of neutrals on the conductivity is small.

In conclusion of this Section, we could show that improvements in the theory of
the dielectric function lead to substantial modiﬁcations in the reﬂectivity. For the
parameter values considered here, the theory predicts a high value of the reﬂectivity
close to the values obtained from the interpolation formula (15). However, we are still
not able to describe the strong variation of the measured reﬂectivity with the electron
density.

3 Smooth density proﬁle

Obviously, it is not possible to interpret the measured values of the reﬂection coeﬃ-
cient of dense Xenon plasmas within the assumption of a step-like density proﬁle, i.e.
d
0 for width of the shock wave front. In particular, the steep increase of the re-
ﬂectivity only at densities above the critical one can not be explained despite a highly
sophisticated approach to the calculation of the dielectric function.

≈

Using the interpolation formula for the dc–conductivity (15) and the Drude formula
(3), eﬀective densities necessary to reproduce the measured values for the reﬂection
coeﬃcient can be deduced. They have been found to lie between 0.75 and 1.6 of the
1021 cm−3 where the plasma frequency coincides with the
critical density ncr = 1.02
×
frequency of the probe laser.

These eﬀective densities can be considered as an argument that the reﬂection of
electromagnetic radiation occurs already in the outer region where the density is low.
Within a simpliﬁed picture, considering a proﬁle with increasing electron density, the
radiation penetrates the low-density region of the plasma up to the region where the
density approaches the critical value. Here the wave will be reﬂected.

To perform an exploratory calculation, a density proﬁle was assumed where the
electron density increases linearly with distance z from zero up to the saturation value
ne at the distance d. We assume the following linear dependence of the dielectric
function on the distance of the shock wave front z

L is the depth where the critical density ncr is reached and the radiation is assumed
to be reﬂected. The total width of the shock wave front is than determined by

Taking the experimental values R for the reﬂectivity, the width dcr of the shock wave
front according to (18) is given in Tab. 4.

3c (cid:19)

Compared with the value given in [1], see also Sec. 1 above, our estimation of the
width of the shock wave front is larger by about one order of magnitude and almost
independent of the thermodynamic parameters. Only the value at the lowest density
value comes out to be smaller.

A more rigorous treatment of the propagation of laser radiation through a shock
wave front should take into account the dependence of the collision frequency on the
local electron density. An arbitrary density proﬁle ne(z) can be approximated by a
suﬃciently large number of thin layers with constant electron density, and solving the
boundary conditions when going from one slab to the next one. In such a way, any
arbitrary density proﬁle ne(z) can be calculated.

We have considered a linear dependence of the electron density on the distance z
within the shock wave front of width d, ne(z) = ne z/d, with ne being the electron den-
sity behind the shock front. The subdivision of the width d into equidistant slabs has
been increased until convergence was reached. For given density ne, the interpolation
formula for the dc conductivity σERR
has been used to ﬁnd the dielectric function of
the corresponding slab according to the Drude formula (3). Results dlin reproducing
the experimental reﬂectivity values R are shown in Tab. 4. Convergence was reached
by dividing dlin into 16 equidistant slabs.

4 Conclusion

In order to infer plasma parameters from optical reﬂection coeﬃcient measurements
10−6
of dense Xenon plasmas, we propose a width of the shock wave front of about 2
m. Only at the lowest density measured, the value for d may be smaller. The linear
density proﬁle should be considered as a model only to estimate the width of the
shock wave front. Our method to approximate a given density proﬁle by a suﬃciently
large number of thin layers with constant electron density can be applied to any ne(z)
which, in general, could be obtained by determining the distribution function for the
non-equilibrium process of the shock wave propagation.

collision frequency was investigated in [5], and minor modiﬁcations (about one half of
that given above) are expected. The eﬀects of non-locality can be neglected in the
region of plasma parameters considered, as shown above for the Born approximation.
Xenon under the conditions considered is a partially ionized plasma. The com-
position is shown in Tab. 1. The conductivity as well as the related quantities are
inﬂuenced by the neutral component, which leads to a modiﬁcation of the reﬂection
coeﬃcient. However, at the temperatures of about 30 000 K the contribution of the
neutral component to the conductivity is small and will not be considered here. Simi-
larly, the role of non–equilibrium eﬀects such as relaxation of the composition will also
not be considered here.

Shock wave front investigations may be the subject of forthcoming experimental
work. An interesting point would be the simultaneous determination of reﬂectivities
at diﬀerent frequencies. It is expected that in this way more information about the
density proﬁle of the shock wave front can be obtained.

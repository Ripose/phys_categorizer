I. INTRODUCTION

The languages of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics permeate much of ﬂuid and
plasma physics. On the one hand, Hamiltonian methods provide powerful analytical and
numerical tools for the investigation of the motion of charged particles in complex electro-
magnetic ﬁelds and the linear and nonlinear stability of plasma and ﬂuid equilibria. On the
other hand, Lagrangian (or variational) formulations of ﬂuid and plasma physics provide
clear guiding principles for the systematic dynamical reduction of ﬂuid and plasma dynam-
ics through the asymptotic elimination of fast degrees of freedom and the construction of
adiabatic invariants either by Lagrangian averaging or by Lie-transform methods. More-
over, variational formulations facilitate the derivation of important conservation laws (e.g.,
energy-momentum, angular momentum, and wave action) through the Noether method.

The present paper summarizes the oral talks presented at the Mini-Conference on Hamil-
tonian and Lagrangian methods in ﬂuid and plasma physics held at the 2002 annual meeting
of the Division of Plasma Physics of the American Physical Society. The paper is organized
by topic and not the chronological order in which the talks were given. The organization
is, therefore, as follows: Hamiltonian methods (Sec. II), Lie-transform methods (Sec. III),
Lagrangian methods (Sec. IV), Lagrangian chaos (sec. V), and a Summary of the Mini-
Conference (Sec. VI). Because this is a summary of a topical mini-conference, and not a
review paper, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive list of references. In-
stead, references to the relevant review papers have been provided, and citations to original
sources can be found there.

II. HAMILTONIAN METHODS

Applications of Hamiltonian methods relie on the existence of a Hamiltonian function
(or functional) H(ζ, t), which depends on a set of coordinates (or ﬁelds) ζ k (k = 1, ..., N),
and a Poisson bracket structure { , } such that Hamilton’s equations are expressed as
dζ k/dt = {ζ k, H(ζ, t)}. Here, the Poisson bracket must satisfy (i) the antisymmetry prop-
erty {f, g} = − {g, f }, (ii) the Leibnitz property {(f g), h} = f {g, h} + {f, h} g, and
(iii) the Jacobi condition {f, {g, h}} = − {g, {h, f }} − {h, {f, g}}, where (f, g, h)
are arbitrary functions (or functionals). Whether the coordinates ζ are canonical or not
determines additional features of the Hamiltonian dynamics. Although the Poisson bracket
structure of a canonical Hamiltonian formulation has a simple form, canonical coordinates
suﬀer from the problem of being unphysical in most cases (e.g., they are gauge dependent).
The exploitation of noncanonical Hamiltonian formulations was pioneered by the work of
Littlejohn on the Hamiltonian theory of guiding-center motion [1]. The physical trans-
parency of noncanonical coordinates comes at the cost of the complexity of the Poisson
bracket structure, although its derivation is solidly grounded mathematically. An impor-
tant consequence of the noncanonical Poisson bracket structure is the existence of Casimir

2

invariants C(ζ), for which {C(ζ), F (ζ)} = 0 for any function F (ζ). For example, the non-
canonical Lie-Poisson bracket structure { , }f for the Vlasov equation is an antisymmetric
bilinear operator on the space of Vlasov distributions f (z) in six-dimensional phase space
deﬁned as [2]

{F, G}f =

f (z)

Z

δF
δf (z)

,

(

δG
δf (z) )

d6z,

where F [f ] and G[f ] are two arbitrary functionals and { , } is the Poisson bracket structure
on six-dimensional phase space. Casimir invariants for the Vlasov equation are of the form
χ(f (z)) d6z, where χ(f ) is an arbitrary function of f and {C[f ], F [f ]}f = 0 for all
C[f ] =
functionals F . Casimir invariants [3] play an important role in deﬁning relative Hamiltonian
equilibria and in investigating linear and nonlinear stability. The present Section focuses
on some applications of Hamiltonian methods in ﬂuid and plasma physics.

R

Phil Morrison, the Mini-Conference keynote speaker, addressed the important question
associated with the signiﬁcance of the existence of a Hamiltonian structure or a variational
(Lagrangian) structure for any dissipationless dynamical system [4]. First, the existence of
a variational structure serves as a guiding principle for deriving exact and reduced dynami-
cal equations [4] and their associated conservation laws. Several variational formulations for
ﬂuids and plasmas exist; the variational formulations for the Vlasov equation are reviewed
by Ye and Morrison [5] while the variational formulations for ideal ﬂuids are reviewed by
Holm, Marsden, and Ratiu [6]. Next, from a practical point of view, the existence of a non-
canonical Hamiltonian structure reveals the existence of Casimir invariants for a continuous
Hamiltonian system and, thus, allow the investigation of the stability of relative Hamilto-
nian equilibria [4]. Through the use of Hamiltonian methods, the stability properties of
numerous dissipationless kinetic, hydrodynamic, and magnetohydrodynamic systems have
been investigated through the Lyapunov [7], Energy-Casimir [8], and Dynamical Accessi-
bility [9] methods. Another signiﬁcant application of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian methods
in fusion plasma physics lies with the Hamiltonian dynamics of magnetic ﬁeld lines and the
existence of closed magnetic surfaces [10].

Next, Morrison reviewed the variational structure of the exact Vlasov equation, begin-
ning with the pioneering work of Low [11] and culminating with recent works by Cendra
et al. [12] and Brizard [13], and the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of several
exact and reduced ﬂuid models (e.g., ideal MHD with ﬂows [14] and reduced MHD [15]).
Morrison concluded his presentation with a functional-integral derivation of the ﬂuctuation
spectrum of a Vlasov-Poisson plasma, again highlighting the usefulness of the Hamiltonian
formalism.

Allan Kaufman reviewed Boghosian’s work [16] on the covariant Lagrangian formula-
tions of guiding-center and oscillation-center plasmas. A covariant variational principle is
formulated for Vlasov-Maxwell plasma dynamics in terms of electromagnetic ﬁelds/potentials
in four-dimensional space-time (with coordinates rµ) and particle orbits in eight-dimensional
phase space (with coordinates zα = (rµ, pµ)). The advantages of a covariant formulation
include a frame-independent representation in which polarization and magnetization eﬀects

3

are treated in a uniﬁed manner. The covariant Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations
of charged-particle dynamics proceed as follows. First, the covariant Hamiltonian struc-
ture of charged particle motion in electromagnetic ﬁelds is given in terms of the covariant
Hamiltonian H(z) = pµpµ/2m ≡ − mc2/2 and the covariant Poisson bracket

{f (z), g(z)} =

(1)

where f (z) and g(z) are arbitrary extended-phase-space functions, and Fµν(r) = ∂µAν(r) −
∂νAµ(r) denotes the electromagnetic ﬁeld. We note here that the electromagnetic ﬁeld
appears only in the Poisson bracket (1), which is derived from the covariant phase-space
Lagrangian Γ = (pµ + e Aµ/c) drµ, and that the covariant Hamiltonian is actually a Lorentz
invariant [17].

The covariant perturbation analysis now proceeds as follows. First, for slowly-varying
ﬁelds F(0)µν (with E(0) · B(0) = 0), Lie-transform methods lead to a covariant guiding-center
(gc) description (Γ → Γgc and H → Hgc). Next, a small-amplitude eikonal wave

is introduced, where ǫ ≪ 1 is the eikonal small parameter while the eikonal amplitude
Aµ,
the eikonal phase θ, and the wave four-vector kµ = ǫ−1∂µθ are slowly-varying functions of
the space-time guiding-center coordinates, so that the covariant guiding-center phase-space
Lagrangian becomes Γgc → Γgc + ǫ Γw. The wave fast time scale is asymptotically elimi-
nated through a near-identity phase-space transformation from guiding-center coordinates
to oscillation-center (oc) coordinates, expressed as asymptotic series expansions in powers
of ǫ and denoted Z(z, ǫ). The phase-space transformation also induces a transformation
on the Hamiltonian (Hgc → Koc = T −1
ǫ Hgc = K0 + ǫ2 K2), where the covariant quadratic
ponderomotive Hamiltonian for oscillation-centers is

which relates the oscillation-center ponderomotive Hamiltonian to the linear susceptibility.
Lastly, Kaufman emphasized the role played by the Noether method in deriving conserva-
tion laws relating the self-consistent evolution of wave, background plasma, and background
ﬁeld [16, 19, 20].

Diego del-Castillo-Negrete presented work on the role of self-consistent chaos in mean-
ﬁeld Hamiltonian models of ﬂuids and plasmas. Mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian theories are inter-
mediate between test-particle Hamiltonian theories, in which particles interact with wave
structures but not with each other, and exact Hamiltonian theories, in which self-consistent
ﬁelds produced by particles are taken into account in wave-particle interactions. Mean-ﬁeld
Hamiltonian models can be used to describe the collective dynamics of marginally stable
ﬂuids (e.g., the dynamics of localized vortices with negative and positive circulation in
shear ﬂows) and plasmas (e.g., the self-consistent evolution of localized electron holes and
clumps in phase space [21, 22]). During his talk, del-Castillo-Negrete presented the Hamil-
tonian formulation of the single-wave model (SWM) equations describing the interaction
of N particles with phase-space coordinates {(xj, uj); j = 1, ..., N} with a single wave
(characterized by a time-dependent complex-valued amplitude a). Here, the Hamiltonian
for the particles is

H =

so that Hamilton’s equations dxj/dt = ∂H/∂uj and duj/dt = − ∂H/∂xj describe the
particle dynamics, while the wave dynamics is represented by the equation

− i U a =

Γk exp(−i xk),

where (σ, U, Γk) are model parameters (e.g., clumps and holes are labeled by Γk > 0 and
Γk < 0, respectively). The SWM equations (3)-(4) have their origin in the study of the
beam-plasma instability [23]. More recently, the system has been systematically derived
under more general conditions as a basic model describing the weakly nonlinear dynamics
of marginally-stable Vlasov-Poisson plasmas and localized vorticity perturbations in shear
ﬂows [21]. Also, the SWM bears interesting similarities with Hamiltonian models used in
the study of long-range interacting systems in statistical mechanics [24].

Numerical simulations based on the single-wave model equations (3), with ﬁnite and
inﬁnite N, show the existence of coherent, rotating dipole states. The coherence of the
dipole is explained in terms of a parametric resonance betwen the rotation frequency of the
macroparticles and the oscillation frequency of the self-consistent mean ﬁeld [25]. The role
of self-consistent chaos in the formation and destruction of phase-space coherent structures
was emphasized by del-Castillo-Negrete. Lastly, for some initial conditions, del-Castillo-
Negrete showed that the mean-ﬁeld exhibits a self-consistent elliptic-hyperbolic bifurcation
that leads to the destruction of the dipole and violent mixing of the phase space (see
Ref. [24] and Section V on Lagrangian Chaos).

III. LIE-TRANSFORM METHODS

The Lie-transform methods traditionally used in Hamiltonian perturbation theory in-

5

volve near-identity (or inﬁnitesimal) canonical transformations. Practical applications of
such perturbative Lie-transform methods normally involve truncation of asymptotic expan-
sions in powers of a small dimensionless parameter ǫ at ﬁnite order and, consequently,
involve moderate algebraic complexity. Non-perturbative Lie-transform methods, which
involve ﬁnite canonical transformations, are used in Hamiltonian orbit theory (associated
with accelerator design, for example) and are, therefore, typically associated with tremen-
dous algebraic complexity (to the point of requiring the use of symbolic manipulation
algorithms). The present Section focuses on Alex Dragt’s presentation on applications of
non-perturbative Lie-transform methods to the technological challenges associated with the
construction of powerful particle accelerators [26, 27], high-resolution electron microscopes
[28], and light optical devices [29, 30].

The Lie-algebraic tools used in accelerator physics and geometric optics include sym-
plectic matrices, symplectic maps, and Lie transformations. A matrix M is symplectic if it
satisﬁes the condition MT · J · M = J, where J represents the canonical symplectic matrix; a
map M is symplectic if its Jacobian matrix is symplectic; and a (ﬁnite) Lie transformation
is deﬁned as

(exp :f:) g = g + {f, g} +

{f, {f, g} } + · · · ,

(5)

1
2

for any phase-space functions f and g (using Dragt’s notation :f:g = {f, g} for Lie opera-
tors).

With these Lie-algebraic tools in hand, we now contemplate their applications. First,

any symplectic map Mf can be factorized as

Mf = (exp :f2:) (exp :f3:) (exp :f4:) · · · ,

where fn is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n in the phase-space coordinates, while its
inverse map is deﬁned as M−1
f = · · · (exp −:f4:) (exp −:f3:) (exp −:f2:). Here, factorization
is facilitated by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ (BCH) theorem

(exp :f:) (exp :g:) = (exp :h:),

(6)

which states that a new Lie operator :h: can constructed from the Lie operators :f: and :g:
through the BCH formula

h = f + g +

{f, g} +

{f, {f, g}} + {g, {g, f }}

+ · · ·

(cid:19)

12 (cid:18)

Proof of the BCH theorem (6) relies on the deﬁnition (5) of the Lie transform and the fact
that the Poisson bracket { , } satisﬁes the antisymmetry property and the Jacobi identity.

Next, the Hamiltonian orbits of charged particles moving in an electromagnetic ﬁeld
(or light rays) propagating through an assembly of beam-line elements (or lenses) are
generated by symplectic maps (i.e., ﬁnite canonical transformations). Since the guiding
action of electromagnetic ﬁelds has strong similarities with the guiding action of lenses, the

6

Lie-algebraic tools deﬁned above can thus ﬁnd applications both in accelerator physics and
in geometric optics. First, a series of elements (electromagnetic multipoles or lenses) can be
represented by the map product M = Mf Mg · · ·, where each element is represented by
a symplectic map Mf , with (exp :f2:) describing paraxial behavior, (exp :f3:) and (exp :f4:)
describing second- and third-order aberrations, etc. Lastly, the product of maps for two
successive elements can be factorized using the BCH theorem (6). Consequently, a map
action M : zin → zout can be explicitly constructed (by drawing tremendous advantage
from symbolic manipulation algorithms).

Applications of Lie-transform methods to the development of electron microscopes
and linear colliders, for example, can lead to the cancellation of spherical aberration (al-
ways present in axially symmetric electromagnetic systems) by the introduction of a sex-
tupole beam-line correcting element. This cancellation can be explicitly calculated by
Lie-transform methods and a consequent spot-size reduction by at least one order of mag-
nitude can be observed (e.g., Dragt presented a case where the spot-size was reduced from
about 3 ˚A to less than 0.1 ˚A). Similar applications in accelerator physics, for example, pro-
vide accelerator designers with the capability of following charged particles through more
than one millions of turns around a storage ring.

IV. LAGRANGIAN METHODS

Lagrangian (or variational) formulations of ﬂuid and plasma physics provide powerful
guiding principles for the derivation of exact and reduced dynamical equations and the
construction of their associated invariants and conservation laws. The present Section
summarizes the talks presented on applications of Lagrangian methods in ﬂuid and plasma
physics.

Before proceeding with our summary, we point out that near-identity transformations
also exist in ﬂuid dynamics (e.g., ideal magnetohydrodynamics). Here, near-identity trans-
formations are expressed in terms of the Lie operator Tǫ deﬁned as

Tǫ χ(x, t) = exp(ǫ ξ · ∇) χ(x, t) = χ(x + ǫ ξ),

(7)

where χ(x, t) is an arbitrary ﬂuid scalar ﬁeld and the vector ﬁeld ξ represents the ideal
ﬂuid displacement from a reference (or unperturbed) position x to the exact (or perturbed)
position x + ǫ ξ(x, t) of a ﬂuid element. Since near-identity transformations are invertible,
we ﬁnd the inverse operator T −1
ǫ = exp(− ǫ ξ · ∇). For Hamiltonian ﬂuid dynamics (with
unperturbed ﬂuid velocity u0), the unperturbed evolution operator is d0/dt = ∂/∂t+ u0 · ∇
while the perturbed evolution operator is dǫ/dt = ∂/∂t + uǫ · ∇, where the perturbed ﬂuid
velocity can be written as

The expressions (9)-(11) can also be derived from the Lie derivative Lξ of appropriate
diﬀerential forms, e.g., ρǫ d3x = exp(−ǫ Lξ)[ρ0 d3x]. Note that the constrained variations of
the ﬂuid and electromagnetic ﬁelds δψa = (δρ, δu, δs, δA) used in the standard variational
formulation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics [6, 31] are deﬁned from ψa
ǫ = (ρǫ, uǫ, sǫ, Aǫ),
as given in Eqs. (8)-(11), as δψa(ξ) ≡ (dψa
ǫ /dǫ)|ǫ=0. For example, (duǫ/dǫ)ǫ=0 = (∂t +
u0 · ∇)ξ − ξ · ∇u0 = δu yields the well-known expression for the constrained (Eulerian)
variation of the ﬂuid velocity u [31].

Darryl Holm presented a variational principle for Euler-Poincar´e equations of geophys-
ical ﬂuid dynamics amenable to asymptotic analysis based on the procedure of Lagrangian
averaging [32]. Holm pointed out that the challenge of geophysical ﬂuid modeling is to
model large-scale (or slow) dynamics while retaining the eﬀects of small-scale (or fast)
dynamics, as represented by ﬂuid turbulence. This situation is reminiscent of the single-
particle case where fast time scales (e.g., orbital time scales associated with gyromotion
or bounce motion of a charged particle in a strong magnetic ﬁeld) are asymptotically
eliminated by Lie-transform methods [1]. In the present case, two averaging procedures
(Eulerian and Lagrangian) oﬀer opposing characteristics. Here, the Lagrangian average of
a ﬂuid quantity χ(x, t), denoted as χ(x, t) and taken at constant Lagrangian coordinate x0,
is deﬁned as χ(x, t) = hχ(x + ǫ ξ, t)i, where h i denotes an Eulerian average (performed
at a ﬁxed spatial location x) and x + ǫ ξ(x, t) represents the exact position of a ﬂuid ele-
ment whose mean position is x (we note that our notation is slightly diﬀerent than that of
Ref. [32]). Hence, Eulerian averaging (taken at a ﬁxed spatial location) commutes with the
spatial gradient and partial time derivative and, consequently, the momentum-conservation
form of hydrodynamical equations is invariant under Eulerian averaging. Lagrangian aver-
aging (or path-averaging taken by following a ﬂuid element) commutes with the advective
time derivative moving with the ﬂuid and, consequently, Lagrangian averaging preserves im-
portant conservation laws (e.g., Kelvin circulation and potential vorticity). Unfortunately,
Eulerian averaging does not preserve these conservation laws while Lagrangian averaging
does not commute with spatial gradients and is (by deﬁnition) history dependent. Never-
theless, a generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) theory for Euler-Poincar´e equations can be
developed within the context of constrained variational principles [32].

8

The description of large-scale (slow) dynamics while retaining the eﬀects of the small-
scale (fast) dynamics is provided by a wave, mean ﬂow interaction (WMFI) model, con-
structed by asymptotic analysis based on two dimensionless parameters (α, ǫ) associated
with wave amplitude (α) and eikonal representation (ǫ) of the wave ﬁelds. For this pur-
ξ(ǫx, ǫt) exp[iǫ−1θ(ǫx, ǫt)] + c.c. so that
pose, we replace ǫξ(x, t) in Eqs. (7)-(10) with α
the perturbed ﬂuid ﬁelds ρǫ, uǫ, and sǫ are replaced with ρ(α,ǫ), u(α,ǫ), and s(α,ǫ), respec-
tively. These expressions are then inserted into the variational principle for geophysical
ﬂuid dynamics and expanded in powers of α and ǫ. The mean-ﬂow Lagrangian is obtained
at zeroth order in α and ǫ, while at order α2, terms representing ray-optics, self-modulation
(dispersion); WKB stability can be collected at zeroth order, ﬁrst order, and second order
in ǫ, respectively. Some approximations of the WMFI variational principle include [32]: (i)
the derivation of the mean-ﬂow dynamics by setting α = 0 and varying with respect to
the mean ﬁelds; (ii) variation with respect to the wave ﬁelds only yields equations suitable
for linearized spectral analysis (with unperturbed mean-ﬂow dynamics included); and (iii)
variation with respect to mean ﬁelds and wave ﬁelds, after phase averaging is performed,
yields the WMFI dynamics.

Lazar Friedland presented his work on an averaged variational principle for multi-phase
nonlinear waves excited and controlled by synchronized nonlinear mode conversion by slow
(adiabatic) passage through resonance [33]. The analysis focused on small periodic pertur-
bations of periodic solutions of the Sine-Gordon (SG) equation [34] utt(x, t) − uxx(x, t) +
sin u(x, t) = ǫ f (x, t). By using an eikonal representation for the perturbation, Friedland
showed that, when the amplitude of the driving perturbation is above a certain threshold,
one can excite a single phase nonlinear waveform synchronized with the drive. Furthermore,
as the driving parameters vary in time and/or space, the emerging phase-locked waveform
slowly evolves near the solution space of the unperturbed problem and, if desired, becomes
highly nonlinear. The oscillatory solutions of the nonlinear SG equation are the plasma and
breather oscillations and Friedland showed how each nontrivial nonlinear solution of the SG
equation created from zero and controlled by a small forcing. Lastly, Friedland presented
an outline of the theory and numerical simulation results of this excitation process based
on multi-phase Whitham’s averaged variational principle.

Eliezer Hameiri presented a review of the variational formulation of the Energy-Casimir
stability analysis of plasma equilibria with general ﬂows [35]. Beginning with a single-
ﬂuid model (Hall-MHD), Hameiri identiﬁed two stream functions ψ and ϕ associated with
axisymmetric plasma equilibrium. The ﬁrst stream function ψ is the familiar magnetic
ﬂux function deﬁned from the magnetic equation B · ∇ψ = 0 while the second stream
function ϕ deﬁnes ﬂow surfaces through the relation u · ∇ϕ = 0. We note that a general
plasma equilibrium with ﬂows requires that its entropy s satisfy u · ∇s = 0, i.e., the
entropy s(ϕ) is a function of the ﬂow stream function ϕ. Moreover, Hameiri showed that
constant-entropy surfaces are also deﬁned from an application of a modiﬁed version of
Ertel’s theorem, which leads to the condition B∗ · ∇s = 0, where B∗ = B + a−1 ∇ × u is
related to the curl of the canonical momentum of the single-ﬂuid (with a = ei/mi). Hence,

9

in an axisymmetric plasma equilibrium with ﬂows, we may write B = ∇ζ × ∇ψ + I ∇ζ
and B∗ = ∇ζ × ∇ϕ + I ∗ ∇ζ, where I and I ∗ are functions of ψ and ϕ (our notation).
After identifying all the constants of the motion for a given plasma equilibrium with ﬂows,
a variational principle is developed [36], which yields a description of plasma equilibrium
with ﬂows in terms of two coupled Grad-Shafranov equations for ψ and ϕ. Hameiri also
discussed extensions of this variational formulation of equilibria with ﬂows to the multi-
species magnetoﬂuid case and the classical ﬂuid case.

Jean-Luc Thiﬀeault presented work on a uniﬁed variational formulation of the nonlin-
ear stability analysis of static [37] and stationary [38] plasma equilibria.
In particular,
the methods of Eulerianized Lagrangian Displacements (ELD) [31] [see Eqs. (8)-(11)], Dy-
namical Accessibility (DA) [9], and Energy-Casimir (EC) [8] are shown to be equivalent
in assessing the stability of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria. Thiﬀeault showed
how suﬃcient conditions for the stability of MHD equilibria can be obtained by using the
Dynamical Accessibility method [4]. The use of dynamical accessibility ensures that the
physical perturbations preserve the natural constraints of the system imposed by the Hamil-
tonian structure. Here, the ﬁrst and second variations of the ﬂuid ﬁelds ζ α are expressed
as δζ α = {G, ζ α} and δ2ζ α = 1
ζ α χα d3x is a generat-
ing functional and { , } is an appropriate Poisson bracket structure. From the ansatz
˙ξ = ρ ∇χ1 − χ2 ∇s + B × ∇ × χ3, Thiﬀeault showed that the ELD and DA methods are
˙ξ (and vice versa). Lastly,
equivalent if the functions χ1, χ2, and χ3 span the space of
Thiﬀeault commented on the fact that this procedure is a generalization of the work of
Newcomb [31] and Arnold [39], among others, who make use of Lagrangian displacements.

V. LAGRANGIAN CHAOS

z and the vorticity scalar ﬁeld ω =

Even in the presence of dissipation, a knowledge of Hamiltonian dynamics improves our
understanding of the role played by dissipative dynamics. John Finn presented numerical
results of work on self-consistent Lagrangian chaos (i.e., chaotic advection) in locking bi-
furcations in two-dimensional shear ﬂows. Here, two-dimensional shear ﬂows are modeled
by the velocity ﬁeld v = ∇φ ×
z · ∇ × v = − ∇2φ in
terms of the scalar ﬁeld φ(x, y, t). Two-dimensional ﬂuid motion ˙x = v is thus described as
a Hamiltonian system ˙x = ∂φ/∂y and ˙y = − ∂φ/∂x, with φ acting as the Hamiltonian. As
is well known, the ﬂuid motion is integrable if the Hamiltonian is time independent, or can
be made time independent by a change of variable, e.g. a change of frame; if the Hamilto-
nian is time dependent, Lagrangian chaos is possible. Lagrangian chaos is deﬁned by the
property of ﬂuid elements following chaotic trajectories while Eulerian chaos is deﬁned in
terms of turbulence at a ﬁxed location; as a result of Lagrangian chaos, if a passive scalar
ﬁeld is injected into a chaotic ﬂow, the passive scalar ﬁeld is advected, stretched, and folded
by the chaotic nature of the ﬂow [40]. Finn pointed out that Lagrangian chaos does not
imply Eulerian chaos (although it enhances transport) and that even laminar periodic ﬂows
can lead to complex Lagrangian trajectories with statistical properties similar to turbulent

Next, Finn investigated the self-consistent Lagrangian chaos in a ﬂuid system consisting
of a nonlinear wave due to a shear-ﬂow (Kelvin-Helmholtz) instability and an externally
imposed sinusoidal perturbation; the ﬂuid was taken to be two-dimensional and incom-
pressible. Self-consistent Lagrangian chaos was observed in the sense that the vorticity
was actively advected with the ﬂow [41]. The Navier-Stokes system describing the ﬂuid
was studied by direct numerical simulation (involving symplectic integration techniques).
In the region of parameter space studied (moderately large Reynolds number), Lagrangian
chaos in the presence of smooth ﬂows is relevant, and in this range the bifurcations which
occur are low dimensional. The main features observed during direct numerical simulations
are locking and unlocking bifurcations, the latter related to the self-consistent Lagrangian
chaos [42]. Lastly, Finn discussed the relation with self-consistent Lagrangian chaos in
shear ﬂows supporting two Kelvin-Helmholtz modes of very diﬀerent phase velocities [43]
(where locking is impossible).

VI. SUMMARY

The Mini-Conference was successful in bringing together experts from a variety of ﬁelds
in physics who actively apply Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods in their research. In his
talk, Morrison highlighted the surprisingly prevalent lexicon of ﬁnite-dimensional Hamilto-
nian systems (that include such terms as integrability, Poincar´e sections, KAM invariant
Indeed, such concepts are
tori, intrinsic stochasticity, and Chirikov’s overlap criterion).
now part of our language, independently of whether we use Lagrangian or Hamiltonian
methods in our research. Kaufman also reminded us of the story of the discovery of the
third (drift) adiabatic invariant by Northrop. According to Kaufman, Edward Teller called
in the Sherwood theory group, and posed the problem of how only 2 (known) invariants
were insuﬃcient to explain the conﬁnement of individual particles in the recently discovered
van Allen belt. As Kaufman recalled, Ted Northrop on his own deduced the drift invariant,
and then co-authored a paper with Teller [44].

The Mini-Conference also included a poster session during which many presentations
were made on applications of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian methods in ﬂuid and plasma
physics. Presenters from France, Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, and
the United States provided ample evidence of the vitality of this ﬁeld of research in ﬂuid
dynamics, laser-plasma interactions, space plasma physics, and theoretical ﬂuid and plasma
physics.

Abstract

This work is devoted to the thermodynamics of high-temperature dense hy-
1 and 102 Mbar. In par-
drogen plasmas in the pressure region between 10−
ticular we present for this region results of extensive calculations based on
a recently developed path integral Monte Carlo scheme (direct PIMC). This
method allows for a correct treatment of the thermodynamic properties of
hot dense Coulomb systems. Calculations were performed in a broad region
of the nonideality parameter Γ . 3 and degeneracy parameter neΛ3 . 10.
We give a comparison with a few available results from other path integral
calculations (restricted PIMC) and with analytical calculations based on Pad´e
approximations for strongly ionized plasmas. Good agreement between the
results obtained from the three independent methods is found.

I. INTRODUCTION

The thermodynamics of strongly correlated Fermi systems at high pressures are of grow-
ing importance in many ﬁelds, including shock and laser plasmas, astrophysics, solids and
nuclear matter, see Refs. [1–4] for an overview. In particular the thermodynamical properties
of hot dense plasmas under high pressure are of importace for the description of plasmas
relevant for laser fusion [5]. Further among the phenomena of current interest are Fermi
liquids, metallic hydrogen [6], plasma phase transition, e.g. [7] and references therein, bound
states etc., which occur in situations where both Coulomb and quantum eﬀects are relevant.
There has been signiﬁcant progress in recent years to study these systems analytically and
numerically, see e.g. [7–10,13–15]. Due to the enormeous diﬃculties to develop analytical
descriptions for hydrogen plasmas with strong coupling, e.g. [1–3], there is still an urgent
need to test the analytical theory by an independent numerical approach.

An approach which is particularly well suited to describe thermodynamic properties
in the region of high pressure, characterized by strong coupling and strong degeneracy,
is the path integral quantum Monte Carlo (PIMC) method. There has been remarkable
recent progress in applying these techniques to Fermi systems, for an overview see e.g.
Refs. [1,2,16–18]. However, these simulations are essentially hampered by the fermion sign
problem. To overcome this diﬃculty, several strategies have been developed to simulate
macroscopic Coulomb systems [8,19,20]: the ﬁrst is the restricted PIMC concept where
additional assumptions on the density operator ˆρ are introduced which reduce the sum
over permutations to even (positive) contributions only. This requires knowledge of the
nodes of the density matrix which is available only in a few special cases, e.g. [19,20].
However, for interacting macroscopic systems, these nodes are known only approximately,
e.g. [21], and the accuracy of the results is diﬃcult to assess from within this scheme. An
alternative are direct fermionic PIMC simulations which have occasionally been attempted
by various groups [22] but which were not suﬃciently precise and eﬃcient for practical
purposes. Recently, three of us have proposed a new path integral representation for the N-
particle density operator [23,24] which allows for direct fermionic path integral Monte Carlo
simulations of dense plasmas in a broad range of densities and temperatures. Using this
concept we computed the pressure and energy of a degenerate strongly coupled hydrogen
plasma [24,26] and the pair distribution functions in the region of partial ionization and
dissociation [26,27]. This scheme is rather eﬃcient when the number of time slices (beads)
in the path integral is less or equal 50 and was found to work well for temperatures kBT &
0.1Ry. In this paper we derive further improved formulas for the pressure and energy and
give, for the ﬁrst time, a detailed derivation of all main results and rigorously justify the
use of the eﬀective quantum pair potential (Kelbg potential) in direct PIMC simulations.
Further, in the present work this method will be applied to high-pressure plasmas (p ≃
1 − 102Mbar) in such temperature regions were considerable deviations from the ideal
10−
behavior are observed.

One diﬃculty of PIMC simulations is that reliable error estimates are often not available,
in particular for strongly coupled degenerate systems. Moreover, in this region no reliable
data from other theories such as density functional theory or quantum statistics, e.g. [3,15],
are available which would allow for an unambiguous test. Furthermore, results from classi-
cal molecular dynamics simulations exist, but they apply only to fully ionized and weakly

2

degenerate plasmas, e.g. [28–30], which is outside the range of interest for this work. Also,
new quantum molecular dynamics approaches are being developed, e.g. [10–12], but they
are only beginning to produce accurate results.

Therefore, it is of high interest to perform quantitative comparisons of independent sim-
ulations, such as restricted and direct fermionic PIMC, and to develop improved analytical
approximations, which is the aim of this paper. We compare recent results of Militzer et al.
[32] for pressure and energy isochors (n ∼ 2.5·1023cm−
3) of dense hydrogen to our own direct
PIMC results. This is a non-trivial comparison since the two approaches employ indepen-
dent sets of approximations. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd very good agreement for temperatures
ranging from 106K to as low as 50, 000K. This is remarkable since there the coupling and
degeneracy parameters reach rather large values, Γ ≈ 3 and neΛ3 ≈ 10, and the plasma
contains a substantial fraction of bound states.

Further, we use the new data to make a comparison with analytical estimates which
are based on Pad´e approximations for strongly ionized plasmas. These formulae were con-
structed on the basis of the known analytical results for the limiting cases of low density
[3,33] and high density [3]. These Pad´e approximations are exact up to quadratic terms in
the density and interpolate between the virial expansions and the high-density asymptotics
[34–36]. We ﬁnd that the results for the internal energy and for the pressure agree well
with the PIMC results in the region of the density temperature plane, where Γ . 1.6 and
nΛ3 . 5.

II. PATH INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION OF THERMODYNAMIC
QUANTITIES

We now our direct PIMC scheme. All thermodynamic properties of a two-component
plasma are deﬁned by the partition function Z which, for the case of Ne electrons and Np
protons, is given by

Z(Ne, Np, V, β) =

Q(Ne, Np, β)
Ne!Np!

,

with

Q(Ne, Np, β) =

dq dr ρ(q, r, σ; β),

(1)

where β = 1/kBT . The exact density matrix is, for a quantum system, in general, not known
but can be constructed using a path integral representation [37],

(ep)]. Further, R(i) = (q(i), r(i)) ≡ (R(i)
e ),
and R(n+1) ≡ R(0) and σ′ = σ. This means, the particles are represented by fermionic
loops with the coordinates (beads) [R] ≡ [R(0); R(1); . . . ; R(n); R(n+1)], where q and r denote
the electron and proton coordinates, respectively. The spin gives rise to the spin part
of the density matrix S, whereas exchange eﬀects are accounted for by the permutation
operator ˆP , which acts on the electron coordinates and spin projections, and the sum over
the permutations with parity κP .
In the fermionic case (minus sign), the sum contains
Ne!/2 positive and negative terms leading to the notorious sign problem. Due to the large
mass diﬀerence of electrons and ions, the exchange of the latter is not included. The matrix
elements ρ(i) can be rewritten identically as

To compute thermodynamic functions, the logarithm of the partition function has to be
diﬀerentiated with respect to thermodynamic variables. In particular, for the equation of
state p and internal energy E follows,

βp = ∂lnQ/∂V = [α/3V ∂lnQ/∂α]α=1,
βE = −β∂lnQ/∂β,

(4)
(5)

where α is a length scaling parameter α = L/L0. This means, in the path integral repre-
sentation (2), each high-temperature density matrix has to be diﬀerentiated in turn. For
example, the result for the energy will have the form

and, analogously for other thermodynamic functions.

There are two diﬀerent approaches to evaluate this expression. One is to ﬁrst choose
an approximation for the high-temperature density matrices ρ(i) and then to perform the
diﬀerentiation. The other way is to ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the operator expression for ρ(k) and
use an approximation for the matrix elements only in the ﬁnal result. As we checked, the
second method is more accurate and will be used in the following.

To evaluate the derivatives in Eq. (6), it is convenient to indroduce dimensionless in-
tegration variables η(k) = (η(k)
) for k = 1, . . . , n and

a = p, e, and κ2

ferentiation of the density matrix aﬀects only the interaction terms. Indeed, one can show

III. HIGH-TEMPERATURE ASYMPTOTICS OF THE DENSITY MATRIX IN
THE PATH INTEGRAL APPROACH. KELBG POTENTIAL

In this section we derive an approximation for the high-tempature density matrix which
is suitable for direct PIMC simulations. Further, we demonstrate that the proper choice
of the eﬀective quantum pair potential is given by the Kelbg potential. Following Refs.
[16,38,39], we derive a modiﬁed representation for the density matrix. The mains steps are:

1. The N-particle density matrix is expanded in terms of 2-particle, 3-particle etc. con-

tributions from which only the ﬁrst, ρab, is retained [16,38,39];

2. In the high-temperature limit, ρab factorizes into a kinetic (ρ0) and an interaction term

(ρab

U ), ρab ≈ ρ0ρab

U , because it can be shown that [40,41]

where ˆI is the unity operator. In this way we get the following representation for the

where Φab(ra, r′a, rb, r′b) is the oﬀ-diagonal two-particle eﬀective potential.

3. In the following, the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements of the eﬀective binary potentials
will be approximated by the diagonal ones by taking the Kelbg potential at the center
coordinate, Φab(r, r′; ∆β) ≈ Φab( r+r′

2 ; ∆β).;

4. For the plasma parameter region of interest, the protons can be treated classically, and

Φii may be approximated by the Coulomb potential.

We will now comment on these steps in some more detail. We calculated the eﬀective
potential by solving a Bloch equation by ﬁrst order perturbation theory. The method has
been described in detail in [41]. This procedure deﬁnes an eﬀective oﬀ-diagonal quantum
pair potential for Coulomb systems, which depends on the inter-particle distances rab, r′ab.
As a result of ﬁrst-order perturbation theory we get explicitely

. It is interesting to note, that a simple approximation of
ab =
the complicated integral over α by the length of the interval multiplied with the integrand in
the center (Mittelwertsatz) leads us to the so-called KTR-potential due to Klakow, Toepﬀer
and Reinhard which (in the diagonal approximation) is often used in quasi-classical MD
simulations [10,13]

In our direct PIMC calculations we used the full expression for the interaction potential,
keeping the α-integration but, in order to save computer time, we approximated the two-
particle interaction potential by its diagonal elements. The diagonal element (r′ab = rab)
of Φab is just the familiar Kelbg potential, given by (we will use the same notation for the
potential)

where xab = |rab|/λab, and we underline that the Kelbg potential is ﬁnite at zero distance.
The error of the above approximations, for each of the high-temperature factors on the r.h.s.
of Eq. (2), is of the order 1/(n + 1)2.

With these approximations, we obtain the result ρ(k) = ρ(k)

U ep(X (k)
e ). Notice that special care has to be taken in performing the derivatives
with respect to β of the Coulomb potentials which appear in Eq. (10). Indeed, products
ρ(1) . . . ρ(n) ˆP ρ(n+1)β ∂∆β
have a singularity at zero interparticle distance which is
integrable but leads to diﬃculties in the simulations. Due to the Kelbg potential, for the e-e
and p-p interaction, this singularity is weakenend, but it is enhanced for the e-p interaction.
In order to assure eﬃcient simulations we, therefore, further transform the e-p contribution

better suited for MC simulations.

The structure of Eqs. (17, 20) is obvious: we have separated the classical ideal gas part
(ﬁrst term). The ideal quantum part in excess of the classical one and the correlation
contributions are contained in the integral term, where the second line results from the ionic
correlations (ﬁrst term) and the e-e and e-i interaction at the ﬁrst vertex (second and third
terms respectively). The third and fourth lines are due to the further electronic vertices and
the explicit temperature dependence [in Eq. (17) and volume dependence in Eq. (20)] of the
exchange matrix, respectively. The main advantage of Eqs. (17, 20) is that the explicit sum
over permutations has been converted into the spin determinant which can be computed
very eﬃciently using standard linear algebra methods. Furthermore, each of the sums in
curly brackets in Eqs. (17, 20) is bounded as the number of vertices increases, n → ∞, and is
thus well suited for eﬃcient Monte Carlo simulations. Notice also that Eqs. (17, 20) contain
the important limit of an ideal quantum plasma in a natural way [42].

IV. COMPARISON OF DIRECT AND RESTRICTED PIMC SIMULATIONS

Expressions (17, 20) are well suited for numerical evaluation using Monte Carlo tech-
niques, e.g. [16,17]. In our Monte Carlo scheme we used three types of steps, where either
electron or proton coordinates, ri or qi or inidividual electronic beads ξ(k)
i were moved un-
til convergence of the calculated values was reached. Our procedure has been extensively
tested. In particular, we found from comparison with the known analytical expressions for

8

pressure and energy of an ideal Fermi gas that the Fermi statistics is very well reproduced
[26]. Further, we performed extensive tests for few–electron systems in a harmonic trap
where, again, the analytically known limiting behavior (e.g. energies) is well reproduced
[43,44]. For the present simulations of dense hydrogen, we varied both the particle number
and the number of time slices (beads). As a result of these tests, we found that to obtain
convergent results for the thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen, particle numbers
Ne = Np = 50 and beads numbers in the range of n = 6 . . . 20 are adequate [24,26].

We will now compare our results with some available results obtained by the Monte
Carlo technique developed by the Urbana group [19,32]. We may ﬁrst state that both
Monte Carlo techniques diﬀer in several fundamental points, so that they are essentially
independent approaches. Let us brieﬂy outline the main diﬀerences between the technique
developed in Urbana, known as the restricted PIMC scheme [32] and references therein, and
the approach described here. These authors performed simulations with 32 electrons and
protons; their restricted PIMC scheme required to use a rather small time step assuring
1/∆β ∼ 2 ∗ 106K. Also, the treatment of the interactions diﬀers from our scheme: the
authors of Ref. [32] perform a numerical solution of the Bloch equation for the two-particle
density matrix whereas we use an analytical approximation for the eﬀective pair interaction
(based on the Kelbg potential, see above). Finally, Ref. [32] approximately computes the
nodal surface of the density matrix using a variational ansatz which is then used to restrict
the integrations to the region of positive density matrix. For more details regarding the
restricted PIMC simulations, see Refs. [19,32].

FIG. 2. Comparison of direct and restricted PIMC results and analytical results (PADE)
for the pressure and total energy of dense hydrogen as a function of temperature for rs = 1.86,
3. For illustration, also the coupling and degeneracy parameters
corresponding to n = 2.5 · 1023cm−
Γ and neΛ3 are shown in the upper ﬁgure.

Let us now turn to a comparison of the numerical results. The restricted PIMC simulation
data for dense hydrogen are taken from Ref. [32]. A comparison of results for the pressure
and the internal energy for a ﬁxed value of the density (rs = 1.86) is shown in Fig. 1 and
TABLE I. At high temperatures, above 50,000 K, where only a small fraction of atoms is
expected, the agreement is rather good. This is remarkable since the nonideality and the
degeneracy reach values of 3 and 10, respectively. This result demonstrates that, at least for
rs ≃ 1 and for T ≥ 50, 000K both methods yield results which are more or less equivalent. At
T < 50, 000K, where partial ionization is expected, we still observe a reasonable agreement
of both approaches, however, we see also that the diﬀerences start to grow. The reasons for
that are manyfold. From our results we conclude that the main problem is not the bound
state formation - atoms and molecules are well described by the two PIMC simulations
which use a physical picture which does not involve any artiﬁcial distinction between free
and bound electrons, e.g. [26]. On the other hand, with growing degeneracy nΛ3, both
PIMC methods become less reliable, and a detailed analysis, although being very desirable,
will have to be based on more extensive calculations in the future.

11

Further we present in TAB. I also Pad´e results for the weakly nonideal region. We ﬁnd
good agreement with the PIMC results for T > 105 K. Details on the method of these
analytical calculations will be discussed in the next section.

V. COMPARISON WITH ANALYTICAL APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE
THERMODYNAMIC FUNCTIONS OF STRONGLY IONIZED DENSE PLASMAS

In this section we give a comparison of the available data points from direct PIMC
calculations with analytical estimates based on Pad´e approximations for strongly ionized
plasmas [3,34–36]. The comparison concentrates on H-plasmas in a region in the density-
temperature plane with the following borders

0.2 ≤ Γ ≤ 1.6,
0.2 ≤ neΛ3

e ≤ 5,

(21)

which will be called “rhomb of moderate nonideality and moderate degeneracy“ (see bold
rhomb in Fig. 1). With respect to analytical treatment, this rhombic region is of particular
diﬃculty since none of the known analytic limiting expressions is valid. Further we calculated
several points for rs = 1.86 and Γ . 2 which correspond to the PIMC data discussed in
the previous section and also an isotherm at T = 50, 000K including some data at higher
density, outside the rhomb, cf. Fig. 1 for an overviev.

We demonstrate below that the Pad´e approximations which interpolate between the
limits where theoretical results are available are a useful tool for the description of the
available data points, at least for the case of moderate nonideality Γ . 1.6 and moderate
degeneracy neΛ3 . 5. The Pad´e approximations which we use here were constructed in
earlier work, [34–36], from the known analytical results for limiting cases of low density
[3,33] and high density [3]. The structure of the Pad´e approximations was devised in such
a way that they are analytically exact up to quadratic terms in the density (up to the
second virial coeﬃcient) and interpolate between the virial expansions and the high-density
asymptotic expressions [34–36]. The formation of bound states was taken into account by
using a chemical picture. This means the plasma is considered as a mixture of free electrons,
free ions, atoms and molecules which are in chemical equilibrium, being described by mass
action laws or minimization of the free energy [36].

We follow in large here this cited work, only the contribution of the ion-ion interaction
which is, in most cases, the largest one, was substantially improved following recent work of
Kahlbaum, who succeeded in describing the available classical Monte Carlo data for the ions
by accurate Pad´e approximations [46]. By using Kahlbaum’s formulas we achieve a rather
accurate description of the thermodynamics in the region where the plasma behaves like a
classical one-component ion plasma imbedded into a sea of nearly ideal electrons. This is
the region where the electrons are strongly degenerate

and the ions are still classical but nonideal

neΛ3

e ≫ 1

and rs ≪ 1,

Γ ≫ 1

and niΛ3

i ≪ 1.

12

(22)

(23)

This region lies in the upper left corner of Fig. 1.

With respect to the chemical picture we restrict ourselves to the region of strong ioniza-
tion where the number of atoms is still relatively low and where the fraction of molecules
is small as well, see below. We will discuss here only the general structure of the Pad´e
formulae. For example, the internal energy density of the plasma is given by

u = uid + uint.

(24)

(25)

Here uid is the internal energy of an ideal plasma consisting of Fermi electrons, classical
protons and classical atoms, and uint is the interaction energy

uint = uii + uee + uie + uvdW.

The interaction contribution to the internal energy consists of four terms:

• Ion-ion interaction contribution: this term which, in general, yields the largest con-
tribution is generated by the OCP subsystem of the protons. For the OCP energy of
protons many expressions are available, e.g. [45]. We have used here the most precise
formula due to Kahlbaum [46] which interpolates between the Debye region, uii ∼ Γ3/2,
and the high density ﬂuid, uii ∼ Γ.

• Electron-electron interaction: This term corresponds to the OCP energy of the electron

subsystem. We used the rather simple expressions used in earlier work [34,35].

• Electron-proton interaction: This term corresponds to the interaction between the two
OCP subsystems which is mostly due to polarization eﬀects. Again, we used the rather
simple expressions proposed in earlier work [34,35].

• Van der Waals contribution: In the region of densities and temperatures deﬁned above
this contribution gives only a small correction. Therefore, this term was approximated
here in the simplest way by a second virial contribution. The neutral particles were
treated as hard spheres.

In the region of densities which are studied here, molecules do not play a role, therefore,
the formation of molecules was taken into account only in a very rough approximation
according to Ref. [34]. The number density of the neutrals was calculated on the basis of a
nonideal Saha equation. We restricted this comparison to a region where the number density
of neutrals is relatively small, the degree of ionization being larger than 75%.

The contributions to the pressure were calculated, in part, from scaling relations e.g. we
used pii = uii/3, and, for the other (smaller) contributions, by numerical diﬀerentiation of
the free energy given earlier [34,35]. In a similar way, the chemical potential which appears
in the nonideal Saha equation was obtained. For the partition function in the Saha equation
we used the Brillouin-Planck-Larkin expression [3,36]. The solution of the nonideal Saha
equation which determines the degree of ionization (the density of the atoms) was solved by
up to 100 iterations starting from the ideal Saha equation.

Since all the expression described so far are given in analytic form, the calculation of
about 1000 data points for energy and pressure takes less than a minute on a PC. The result
of our calculations for density-temperature points in the “rhomb of moderate nonideality
and moderate degeneracy” are given in Figs. 2,3. Further, we give in TAB. I several data
points obtained from the Pad´e formulas. Since the Pad´e formulas used here do not apply to
low temperatures, we included in TAB. I only Pad´e data for T > 105K.

Summarizing the results for the internal energy and for the pressure we ﬁnd that the Pad´e
results, with a few exceptions, agree well with the PIMC data in the region of the density
temperature plane, where Γ ≤ 1.6 and nΛ3 ≤ 5. The agreement is particularly good for the
energies. [The larger deviations for the pressure may be due to the numerical diﬀerentiation.]
In fact, the Pad´e formulas used here in combination with the chemical picture works only
in the case that the plasma is strongly ionized, i.e. the degree of ionization is larger than
75%. The description of the region where a higher percentage of atoms and, due to this,
also molecules is present needs a more reﬁned chemical picture [7,47,48].

FIG. 5. Comparison of Pad´e calculations (lines without symbols) of the pressure (in units of the

T = 50, 000K.

Finally, we compare the Pad´e and PIMC data along the isotherm T = 50, 000K which
is given in Fig. 5. This ﬁgure shows the transition from a classical ideal gas (low density)
3 .
to a nearly ideal quantum gas (limit of high density). In the central part, n . 1019cm−
1025cm−
3, Coulomb interaction leads to strong deviations from the behavior of an ideal
plasma. The strong increase of the energy at high density is due to the Mott eﬀect and to
the increase of the ideal quantum contribution to the electron energy. Comparing the Pad´e
and PIMC results, we ﬁnd good agreement up to electron densities n = 1022cm3. For higher
densities, the deviations are growing. For intermediate densities, n . 1022cm−
3
3 . 1024cm−
the PIMC data are more reliable. On the other hand, in the limit of very high density, rs ≪ 1,

16

the Pad´e results are known to correctly approach the ideal quantum plasma limit whereas the
PIMC data should be regarded as preliminary due to the extremely high electron degeneracy.
Interestingly, we ﬁnd that at high density the Pad´e data approaches the ideal curves earlier
than the PIMC data which is important for further improvement of the presented Monte
Carlo approach.

VI. DISCUSSION

This work is devoted to the investigation of the thermodynamic properties of hot dense
partially ionized plasmas in the pressure range between 0.1 and 100 Mbar. Most of the new
results are based on a Quantum Monte Carlo study of a correlated proton-electron system
with degenerate electrons and classical protons. In this paper, we gave a detailed derivation
of improved estimators for the internal energy and the equation of state for use in direct
fermionic path integral simulations. Also, we gave a rigorous justiﬁcation for the use of an
eﬀective quantum pair potential (Kelbg potential) in PIMC simulations.

Further, we compared our direct PIMC results with independent restricted PIMC data
of Militzer and Ceperley for one isochor corresponding to rs = 1.86, Fig. 2. We found very
good quantitative agreement between the two PIMC methods for temperatures in the range
of 50, 000K ≤ T ≤ 106K, where Γ . 3 and neΛ3
e . 10. This region is particularly com-
plicated as here pressure and temperature ionization occur and, therefore, an accurate and
consistent treatment of scattering and bound states is crucial. This agreement is remarkable
because the two simulation methods are completely independent and use essentially diﬀerent
approximations. We, therefore, expect that the results for the thermodynamic properties
of high pressure hydrogen plasmas in this temperature-density range are reliable within the
limits of the simulation accuracy. This is the main result of the present paper.

In future work, it will be important to extend the range of agreement. To analyze
the deviations between the simulation methods, we also included some data for rs = 1.86
and lower temperatures, 10, 000K ≤ T ≤ 50, 000K, Fig. 2. At this point, no conclusive
answer about the reasons of the deviations can be given. For these parameters, the electron
degeneracy is growing rapidly and, therefore, each of the simulation methods is becoming
less reliable. So these data should be regarded as preliminary results which will be useful
for future improvements of the simulations.

Furthermore, the Monte Carlo results allowed us to develop and test analytical approxi-
mations of Pad´e-type which are improvements of earlier approximations [3,34–36] in a region
in the density-temperature plane bounded by Γ ≤ 1.6 and neΛ3
e ≤ 5. This is a region of
moderate nonideality and degeneracy and high degree of ionization. We have shown that for
these parameters, the Pad´e approximations which interpolate between the limits where the-
oretical results are available agree well with the Monte Carlo data, cf. Figs. 2-4 and Table I.
Thus, these approximations provide a useful tool for the description of these plasmas which
include hydrogen at a pressur between 0.1 and 100 Mbar. At lower temperature, deviations
from the Monte Carlo data are growing, cf. Fig. 2. This is mostly due to the growing
role of bound states. Whether the Pad´e approximations, in combination with an improved
chemical picture (mass action law), continue to work at lower temperatures, has still to be
explored, ﬁrst steps are under way [48].

17

Also, we showed some data for T = 50, 000K and higher pressure, up to p ∼ 106 Mbar,
Fig. 5. Here the Monte Carlo simulations are particularly diﬃcult due to the high electron
degeneracy, and they can beneﬁt from the Pade simulations, as the latter correctly reproduce
the high-density limit, rs ≪ 1.

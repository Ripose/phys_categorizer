1. Introduction. The standard theory of the tearing-mode evolution identiﬁes three stages.
The ﬁrst is the linear stage described by the Furth–Killeen–Rosenbluth (FKR) theory [1].
During this stage, the island width W grows exponentially in time until it reaches the width
η2/5∆′1/5, where η is the resistivity and ∆′ is the
of the resistive dissipation layer, ℓη ∝
ℓη, nonlinear terms are suﬃciently large to
instability parameter [see Eq. (3)]. Once W
∼
replace inertia as the force opposing the inﬂow pattern. A slow down of the growth ensues,
η∆′. This is the second stage of the tearing-
from exponential to linear in time: dW/dt
mode evolution, known as the Rutherford regime [2]. Finally, the third, saturated, stage is
reached when the island width becomes comparable to the equilibrium shear length [3].

∼

In this paper, we ﬁnd the tearing-mode evolution to be, in fact, a four-stage process:
the FKR regime, the Rutherford regime, a regime of fast nonlinear island growth that we
identify as Sweet–Parker (SP) reconnection, and saturation. We carry out a set of numer-
ical simulations that demonstrate two main points. First, we show that, given suﬃciently
small η, the Rutherford regime always exists; larger values of ∆′ require smaller values of η.
Rutherford’s negligible-inertia assumption is validated and the asymptotically linear depen-
dence of dW/dt on η and ∆′ is conﬁrmed. Second, we ﬁnd that, at large ∆′, the Rutherford
regime is followed by a nonlinear stage of fast growth linked to X-point collapse and forma-
tion of a current sheet. This causes the reconnection to become SP-like. The signature η1/2
scaling of the eﬀective island growth rate is, indeed, found in this nonlinear stage. The SP
stage culminates in the saturation of the mode, which can, thus, be achieved much faster
than via Rutherford regime.

2. The Model. We use the conventional Reduced MHD set of equations [4] in 2D for a
plasma in the presence of a strong externally imposed magnetic ﬁeld Bz:

choose ψ0 = 1.3 so that the maximum value of the unperturbed in-plane magnetic ﬁeld

perturbed with ψ(1) = ψ1(x) cos(ky), where k = mLx/Ly. In our simulations, the initial

3. The Rutherford Regime. Rutherford’s analysis depends on the assumption of negligi-
ble inertia, which reduces the vorticity equation to B⊥ ·
∇jk=0. This implies that jk = jk(ψ)
everywhere except at the separatrix (the in-plane magnetic ﬁeld vanishes at the X-point).
Fig. 1 proves the validity of this assumption. At the separatrix, ψ
1.17. Larger values of
ψ correspond to the interior the island. The variation of ψ in that region is relatively small,
supporting the “constant-ψ approximation” used by Rutherford.

Fig. 2 shows the time evolution of the island width W at constant ∆′ = 8.15 and varying
resistivity. After the exponential growth stage, a distinct period of linear in time growth is
manifest in all curves. Figs. 3 and 4 show the dependence of dW/dt during the linear in time
period on ∆′ and η, respectively, demonstrating in both cases the linear relation predicted
by Rutherford. At ﬁxed ﬁnite η, the Rutherford scaling breaks down at large ∆′. However,
for a given ∆′, it is recovered asymptotically at suﬃciently small η.

Although Rutherford-like island growth has been observed in earlier numerical work, no
parameter scan showing the linear scaling of dW/dt with η and ∆′ has previously been per-
formed. White et al. [6] veriﬁed the linear in time growth of the island in their numerical
simulations of the m = 2 mode performed in tokamak geometry, a result later conﬁrmed by
Park et al. [7]. Biskamp [8] demonstrated the Rutherford behaviour in a numerical experi-
ment done in slab geometry and with a current-dependent resistivity. Biskamp’s simulations
had a relatively small value ∆′ = 3. Recently, Jemella et al. [9] carried out a ∆′ parameter
scan with ∆′
[0.92, 20.93] (and constant η). Their results cast doubt upon the validity
of Rutherford’s analysis by failing to produce the linear in time behaviour: except for the
smallest values of ∆′, the island growth was exponential at all times. They argued that,
instead of Rutherford’s X-point conﬁguration, a Sweet–Parker (SP) current sheet is formed
and, consequently, SP reconnection replaces the Rutherford regime.

We think that the absence of the Rutherford regime in Jemella et al. simulations is, in
fact, due to the particular equilibrium conﬁguration that they used: B(0)
y = cos(x). We
have also performed simulations with such a conﬁguration and found the Rutherford stage
absent, validating their results. The reason for this apparent sensitivity to the equilibrium
proﬁle is that a cosine conﬁguration gives rise to two islands in the simulation box. In the
nonlinear stage, circulating ﬂows between the two X-points are established, which impedes
the formation of well-separated nonlinear slow-down ﬂows derived by Rutherford. We believe
that, in order for the Rutherford regime to be recovered in the cosine conﬁguration, even
smaller values of η than used by Jemella et al. (or by us) are necessary. Biskamp [8], who used
B(0)
y = tanh(x), did not have this problem and, accordingly, was able to see the Rutherford
regime.

4. The Fast Nonlinear Stage. In simulations with large ∆′, we ﬁnd that the X-point
conﬁguration maintained during the Rutherford regime eventually collapses and a current
sheet is formed (Fig. 5). A dramatic speed up of the island growth ensues (Fig. 6). Fig. 7
1/t during this fast nonlinear
shows that the peak eﬀective growth rate γ = d ln W/dt
stage scales as η1/2, thus supporting the expectation that the reconnection in this regime
is of the SP kind. This behaviour can be qualitatively understood by recalling that the
X-point conﬁguration assumed in Rutherford’s analysis is, in fact, unstable [10]. As time
goes on, the eﬀective island growth rate in the Rutherford regime decreases (γ
1/t) and
eventually becomes so low that the X-point conﬁguration can no longer be sustained over

Note that, for large ∆′, if η is not suﬃciently small for the Rutherford stage to occur,
the SP stage nearly immediately follows the FKR stage, as is the case in Jemella et al.
simulations. In the opposite case of small ∆′ and small η, the saturation can be reached
directly from the Rutherford stage, with the SP stage never having time to materialise.

We leave a more detailed theoretical description of the nonlinear speed-up eﬀect to a

forthcoming paper.

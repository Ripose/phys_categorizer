Darwin (1920) noted that when radiation can be neglected it should be possible to eliminate
the radiation degrees-of-freedom from the action of classical electrodynamics and keep the discrete
particle degrees-of-freedom only. Darwin derived his well known Lagrangian by series expansion in
v/c keeping terms up to order (v/c)
. Since radiation is due to acceleration the assumption of low
speed should not be necessary. A Lagrangian is suggested that neglects radiation without assuming
low speed. It cures deﬁciencies of the Darwin Lagrangian in the ultra-relativistic regime.

give the correct Lagrangian to this order. More recent
derivations can be found in a few textbooks [2–4]. In par-
ticular Jackson [4] notes that using the Coulomb gauge
A = 0) makes the electrostatic Coulomb potential
(
∇ ·
φ exact and moves all approximation to the vector po-
tential A which obeys the inhomogeneous wave equation
with the transverse (divergence free) current as source.
The Darwin Lagrangian results when the term c−2∂2/∂t2
in the d’Alembert operator is neglected so that the equa-
tion becomes a Poisson equation.

The Darwin Lagrangian has been shown to be a
unique approximately relativistic Lagrangian (Woodcock
It can be derived from
and Havas [5], Kennedy [6]).
the Fokker-Wheeler-Feynman action-at-a-distance the-
ory (Anderson and Schiminovich [7]), and it is useful in
various fundamental studies of electrodynamics [8–11].
The magnetic interaction described by the Darwin La-
grangian is essential in relativistic many-electron calcu-
lations as noted by Breit and others [12–15]. It has found
applications in nuclear physics [16, 17], and especially in
plasma physics, for numerical simulation [18–22], ther-
modynamics and kinetics [23–27], as well fundamental
theory [28–30].

Corrections to the Darwin Lagrangian have been dis-
cussed. Since a system of particles with identical charge

to mass ratio does not dipole radiate a higher order ex-
pansion should be meaningful for such systems [31–33].
To that order, however, acceleration inevitably enters
and must be handled in some way. Others have argued
that since radiation is due to acceleration, v/c expansion
is irrelevant, and further that radiation can be negligible
even if the particle speeds are considerable (Trubnikov
and Kosachev [34], Frejlak [35]). We will pursue that
lead here.

A natural idea that does not work is to assume constant
velocities and use the known exact Li´enard-Wiechert po-
tentials for that case in (1). Darwin’s original derivation
shows that this does not give the electric interaction to
suﬃciently accuracy. It is important to note that gauge
invariance (for a review, see Jackson and Okun [36]),
which is valid for the exact theory, does not necessar-
ily hold for approximations. One can therefore impose
the Coulomb gauge (for a recent discussion see Heras
[37]) and then solve the inhomogeneous wave equation for
A assuming constant velocities in the transverse current
In this way one treats the electric interaction
density.
exactly, neglects acceleration in the solution for A, but
do not assume low speeds.

The constant velocity exact Coulomb gauge vector po-
tential does not seem to be well known. A special case
was solved by Labarthe [38]. The explicit general solu-
tion has recently been published by Hnizdo [39] who used
a gauge transformation function given by Jackson [40] to
ﬁnd it, starting from the corresponding Li´enard-Wiechert
potentials. Hnizdo’s solution assumes that the velocity
is along the x-axis, but when it is written in coordinate
independent form, it is,

Note that g(1) = 1 but that h diverges for x = 1. From
these expansions it is clear that the leading terms give
the vector potentials (3) of the Darwin Lagrangian.

The vector potential of the original Darwin Lagrangian
is thus recovered from (4) when η = 0. One notes that
in the derivation of (3) there was no need to assume that
the velocity is constant since the solution to the Poisson
equation does not require retardation. The fact that re-
tardation still is accounted for to order (v/c)2 is due to
the use of the Coulomb gauge.

We now consider two special cases. If the velocity of a
particle is parallel to the inter-particle vector to another
particle, η = 0, so the Darwin interaction needs no cor-
rection in these cases. Assuming that two particles have
equal velocities v1 = v2 = v parallel to ˆr21 we ﬁnd the
the interaction term in (1) gives,

In conclusion, the Lagrangian obtained by using the
exact constant velocity Coulomb gauge vector potential
(4), instead of the A used in (3), has been derived with-
out assuming that v/c is small, only that accelerations
are not needed in estimating the Coulomb gauge vector
potential.
In this way all velocity dependent retarda-
tion is accounted for. We have also shown that using
this Lagrangian we account correctly for the pinching of
an ultra-relativistic beam, something the original Darwin
Lagrangian does not do.

Here the second term is from the Coulomb interaction.
One sees that this goes to zero in the ultra-relativistic
c. Now consider instead the interaction of two

particles that move with equal velocities, v1 = v2 = v,
but side by side, so that, ˆr21 ⊥

of the Lagrangian (1) is then,

One sees that even in the limit v
c the Coulomb in-
teraction dominates; the magnetic interaction can only
compensate for half of it. This is clearly wrong, however.
It is well known that in an ultra-relativistic beam the
transverse Lorentz force cancels the transverse Coulomb
repulsion (see e.g. [41]).

Let us instead use the vector potential (4). We ﬁrst
note that in this, side by side, case η2 = v2/c2 and thus
η2 = 1 in the limit v
c. In this limit g(1) = 1 and h
diverges. The two scalar products in the second term of
the numerator will, however, be zero and a simple inves-
tigation shows that this compensates for the divergence
of h, so that term does not contribute. Finally thus,

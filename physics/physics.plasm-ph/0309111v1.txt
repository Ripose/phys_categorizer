Abstract

The nonlinear dynamics of a bundle of magnetic ﬂux ropes driven by sta-

tionary ﬂuid motions at their endpoints is studied, by performing numerical

simulations of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. The develop-

ment of MHD turbulence is shown, where the system reaches a state that is

characterized by the ratio between the Alfv´en time (the time for incompress-

ible MHD waves to travel along the ﬁeld lines) and the convective time scale

of the driving motions. This ratio of time scales determines the energy spectra

and the relaxation toward diﬀerent regimes ranging from weak to strong tur-

bulence. A connection is made with phenomenological theories for the energy

spectra in MHD turbulence.

I. INTRODUCTION

The search for universal scaling properties in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, of the

type developed by Kolmogorov [1] for hydrodynamic turbulence, has been the subject

of many theoretical and numerical studies, since the pioneering phenomenological argu-

ments put forward independently by Iroshnikov and Kraichnan [2,3] (hereafter IK). The

phenomenological arguments of Kolomogorov, which give rise to the famous power law

k−5/3 for the omnidirectional energy spectrum Ek in terms of the wavenumber k, were

Ek ∼
modiﬁed by IK to include magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects, deriving an energy spectrum power law

k−3/2. An alternative point of view, however, was proposed [4] indicating that

like Ek ∼
the original Kolmogorov scenario is still applicable in certain cases to MHD as well as to

hydrodynamics. Along similar lines, a phenomenological theory was proposed in Ref. [5] for

a steady inertial range spectral law that reduces to the IK and Kolmogorov laws in appropri-

ate limits. To distinguish between the two power laws is a diﬃcult task both observationally

and numerically [6], partly because the power law indexes are too close, but also because

assumptions on the theories, such as homogeneity, isotropy and time stationarity are often

lost.

For instance, when a strong, externally supported, magnetic ﬁeld is present, the key

assumption of isotropy breaks down. It has been shown [7–10] that the cascade renders itself

anisotropic, and that the spectrum in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld becomes strongly

suppressed. This situation also holds for compressible MHD, where a variance anisotropy

is also found [11], i.e., components of the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds in the strong magnetic ﬁeld

direction are small compared to the transverse components. On theoretical grounds, this

conﬁguration has been found [12] to be appropriately described, in the low-frequency limit,

by the so called Reduced MHD [13,14] approximation (RMHD).

Phenomenological theories alternative to the IK scenario [2,3] when a strong magnetic

ﬁeld is present have been also presented to describe the perpendicular spectrum in anisotropic

conditions [15,9]. Recently, a formal closure model has been introduced, which obtains a

2

kinetic equation for the anisotropic energy spectrum in the limit known as weak MHD

turbulence [16].

Besides the anisotropy introduced by a strong magnetic ﬁeld, another eﬀect that may

modify the cascade situation is the presence of driving boundaries. We intend to address

the eﬀect of both a strong external magnetic ﬁeld and the driving boundaries on MHD

turbulence, by considering the particular case of a plasma under a strong uniform ﬁeld in

the z-direction, limited within the transverse planes z = 0 and z = Lz where an imposed

velocity ﬁeld is applied. This case is inspired in the theoretical model of a coronal magnetic

loop, which is forced through convective motions at its footpoints. Such a model loop,

proposed in Ref. [17], has been widely studied in many diﬀerent contexts, although not

necessarily in a turbulent scenario. Most studies address the issue of current sheet formation

[18–20], non-steady reconnection [21,22] and coronal heating [23,24,21,25,26]. However, this

paper is not aimed at studying the dynamics of coronal magnetic loops. Instead, we focus

our analysis on the (steady) perpendicular energy spectrum of boundary driven RMHD

and make a connection with the phenomenological theories of MHD turbulence. We pay

particular attention to the issues of numerical resolution required to yield well resolved

turbulent spectra from direct numerical simulations.

The organization of the paper is as follows: in section II we present our model and the

RMHD equations. Section III contains a description of the boundary conditions and the

numerical code. Section IV describes the statistically steady regime and the dissipation rate

scaling law. In Section V we show the numerically obtained energy spectra and discuss the

connection with phenomenological theories of turbulence. Issues of numerical resolution are

also addressed. Section VI discusses the typical dissipative structures. Section VII contains

the conclusions.

II. MODEL AND EQUATIONS

Let us assume a low-β magnetoﬂuid (β is the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure)

permeated by an initially uniform magnetic ﬁeld B = B0ˆz, which is elongated along the

ˆz-direction (i.e. Lz ≫
reduced magnetohydrodynamic equations (RMHD) are applicable [13,14,12] to describe the

L⊥), as shown in Figure 1. Under these conditions, the so-called

dominant low-frequency non-linear motions. Within this approximation, the magnetic and

velocity ﬁelds are both divergence-free and can be expressed as

where a(x, y, z, t) is the magnetic ﬂux function and ψ(x, y, z, t) is the stream function. The

RMHD equations in terms of these scalar potentials are:

current density. The coeﬃcient vA = B0/√4πρ is the Alfv´en speed, ν is the kinematic

viscosity and η is the magnetic diﬀusivity. The non-linear terms in these equations are

expressed in terms of standard Poisson brackets, i.e. [u, v] = (∂xu)(∂yv)

(∂yu)(∂xv).

−

This particular theoretical setup is relevant to several plasma applications, ranging from

tokamaks to magnetic loops in the solar corona. The RMHD framework has been used to

study the dynamics of coronal loops in solar active regions [23,19,21,25]. The axial (and

approximately constant) magnetic ﬁeld in these loops has both ends or footpoints anchored

in the solar photosphere. The photosphere is a high-β plasma, which is also convectively

turbulent. These convective motions at the photosphere, in turn move the magnetic ﬁeldlines

around, and drive the coronal part of the loops into a rather complex dynamical scenario.

We specify the velocity ﬁelds at the boundaries as

ψ(z = 0) = 0,

ψ(z = Lz) = Ψ(x, y)

(5)

where Ψ(x, y) is the stream function which describes stationary and incompressible footpoint

motions. The strength of this external velocity ﬁeld is proportional to a typical velocity Up.

To transform equations (3)-(4) into their dimensionless form, we choose lp = L⊥/(2π)

and Lz as the units for transverse and longitudinal distances. Since the dimensions of all

physical quantities involved in these equations can be expressed as combinations of length

Lz/vA as the time unit. The dimensionless RMHD equations

and time, let us choose tA ≡

are the (dimensionless) magnetic and kinetic dissipation

coeﬃcients. Hereafter, we will consider the case S = R, and thus the (common) dissipation

coeﬃcient will be the only dimensionless parameter explicitly present in equations (6)-(7) .

III. DESCRIPTION OF THE CODE AND BOUNDARY DRIVING

We numerically integrated equations (6)-(7). To this end, ψ and a are expanded in

Fourier modes in each (x, y) plane (0

x, y

2π and 0

1). The corresponding

≤

≤

z

≤

≤

Fourier coeﬃcients ψk(z, t) and ak(z, t) are evolved in time using a semi-implicit scheme:

linear terms are treated in a fully implicit fashion, while nonlinear terms are evolved using

a second order Runge-Kutta scheme. Also, nonlinear terms are evaluated following a 2/3

fully dealiased (see Ref. [27]) pseudo-spectral technique.

To compute z-derivatives we use a standard method of ﬁnite diﬀerences in a staggered

regular grid (see for instance Refs. [13,19]) of Nz +1 points. The stream function is computed

5

on points zi = i/Nz (i = 0, . . . , Nz), while the magnetic ﬂux function is computed on

zi+1/2 = (i + 1/2)/Nz (i = 0, . . . , Nz −
are given at the plates z = 0 and z = 1. Therefore, equation (7) is not integrated on these

1). Boundary conditions for the stream function ψ

planes, but it is evolved in time in all the internal gridpoints zi = i/Nz (i = 1, . . . , Nz −

1).

We specify the stream function in equation (5) as

Ψk = Ψ0 = tA/tp,

if 3 < k lp < 4

(8)

Ψk = 0

elsewhere

This expression imitates a stationary pattern of eddy motions of diameters between

L⊥/4 and L⊥/3, rotation speeds Up and typical turnover times tp = lp/Up. Our choice of

this narrowband and non-random forcing ensures that the broadband energy spectra that

we obtain are exclusively determined by the nonlinear nature of the MHD equations.

The strength of the external driver is quantiﬁed by the dimensionless factor Ψ0 = tA/tp in

equation (9), which is given by the ratio of the Alfven time of the system (i.e. the response

time to an impulse applied at the boundary) to the timescale of the driver itself (i.e. the

eddy turnover time). Note that the velocity ﬁelds that we are imposing at the boundaries

are stationary. For non-stationary footpoint motions, which might for instance represent

wave activity or time-correlated random ﬂows, other timescales should be considered in

connection with the driver.

IV. STATIONARY REGIMES AND SCALING LAW

As mentioned in Section 2 , the dissipation coeﬃcient S (with S = R) is the only

dimensionless parameter present in equations (6)-(7). Just as important is the dimensionless

factor tA/tp introduced by the external force applied at the boundary. Therefore, we are left

with these two dimensionless numbers to characterize the solutions of the RMHD equations

[i.e. equations (6)-(7) with the boundary condition given by equation (5) and equation (9)].

From purely dimensional considerations, we know that for any physical quantity, its

6

dimensionless version Q should be an arbitrary function of the only two dimensionless pa-

rameters of the problem, i.e.

Q =

(Q1, Q2), Q1 =

(10)

A sequence of numerical simulations for diﬀerent values of the dissipation coeﬃcient

performed in Ref. [25] (see also Ref. [28]), indicated that the dependence of the dissipation

rate with S is rather mild. This relative insensitivity of the dissipation rate with the dis-

sipation coeﬃcient is consistent with similar results obtained from experiments in purely

hydrodynamic turbulence [29–31]. It is also consistent with one of Kolmogorov’s hypothesis

for statistically steady turbulent regimes at very large Reynolds numbers, which assumes

that the dissipation rate remains ﬁnite in the limit of vanishing viscosity [31]. Therefore,

if we assume that the dissipation rate in statistically steady turbulent regimes in RMHD

is approximately independent of the dissipation coeﬃcient S, we readily obtain that the

dissipation rate will only depend on the time ratio tA/tp. A second series of simulations

[25], in this case for diﬀerent values of the ratio tA/tp, led to the following expression for the

In the present paper, we performed numerical simulations of equations (6)-(7) with S =

2000 and diﬀerent values of the ratio tA/tp in the range [0.1, 1]. Note that tA/tp can also

be written as tA/tp = (Lz/lp)/(vA/Up). For consistency with the RMHD approximation,

both Lz/lp and vA/Up should remain much larger than unity. However, as mentioned above,

the only relevant parameter in this problem is tA/tp, which is free to take any value. An

additional simulation with tA/tp = 2 and S = 800 is also performed. Numerical resolution

ranges from 256

to perform those runs, and a parallel RMHD code has been designed. Since ﬁnite-diﬀerences

are used in the z-direction, while a pseudospectral method is employed for the transverse

directions, a very eﬃcient parallelization is achieved by performing the transverse gradients

locally in each machine, while employing communication between machines only to perform

the z-derivatives. The typical behavior of the magnetic and kinetic energy as a function of

time is shown in the top panel of Figure 2, while the bottom panel shows the dissipation

rate for the particular case of tA/tp = 0.5 with 256

256

64 resolution. After an initial

×

×

transient, the dissipation rate is seen to approach a statistically steady level.

V. ENERGY SPECTRA

Energy spectra of turbulent ﬂuctuations are essential both for phenomenological and

statistical theories of MHD turbulence. We compute the perpendicular spectra at each

plane and integrate in z to obtain a perpendicular spectrum,

where the total energy can be obtained as E =

Ek⊥dk⊥.

R
As we have pointed out in the previous section, the system reaches an approximately

steady state where the forcing is compensated by dissipation (Figure 2 bottom). The ﬁrst

stage of the system evolution is followed using a low resolution simulation. Once the steady

state is achieved, a higher resolution simulation is started, by taking the Fourier coeﬃcients

from the previous run and padding the additional high k coeﬃcients to zero. After a short

transient, those additional coeﬃcients are populated by the nonlinear cascade in a few

eddy turnover times. In this way, a high resolution steady state spectrum is obtained in a

relatively shorter computer time. The high resolution runs (2048

2048

64) are however

×

×

computationally demanding, even for runs of a few eddy turnover times.

In Figure 3 we show the magnetic and kinetic energy perpendicular spectra for diﬀerent

values of the quantity tA/tp. The right panel plots show the compensated spectra (magnetic

plus kinetic), which allow determination of the power law index α observed in the inertial

range where Ek⊥ ∼
index depends on the value of tA/tp. For low values of tA/tp a rather steep spectra (α > 2)

k−α
⊥ . A ﬁrst clear result observed in these plots is that the power law

is observed. At intermediate values of tA/tp the power law index is approximately equal to

α = 2. For larger values of tA/tp the spectral law becomes ﬂatter (α < 2). As shown in

Figure 4, when tA/tp = 2 a value close to α = 5/3 is obtained. For this last simulation a

lower value of S = 800 has to be employed, in order to have a well resolved spectrum (see

discussion below).

Phenomenological theories [15,32] and a more formal theory based on closures [16] have

been proposed to explain a k−2 spectra in a regime known as the weak turbulence limit. An

alternative phenomenological derivation of this power law can be done using the general

approach proposed in Ref. [5] in terms of the triple correlation time. The energy supply ǫ

is assumed to be equal to the k-independent spectral transfer rate. As stated in Ref. [5], if

τ3(k) is the time scale for decay of triple correlations, which induce the spectral transfer to

wavenumbers higher than k, then [3,5]

conditions. It is also interesting that an essentially similar argument [33] has been applied

to the case of purely hydrodynamic turbulence in the presence of strong rotation, where

the triple correlation time is set equal to a ﬁxed external timescale τ3

tΩ = 1/Ω. This

are ﬁxed, except for Up, we can interpret these runs as diﬀerent evolutions of the system

when varying the intensity Up of the boundary driving. The result is that as the driving

intensity is enhanced (i.e. larger tA/tp), the spectrum becomes ﬂatter and the regime goes

through weak turbulence to a strong Kolmogorov-like state. As shown by Figure 3 (left

panels), the kinetic energy spectrum is always smaller than the magnetic energy spectrum

and the ratio Eu

k is smaller (especially at the low k structures) when the forcing is weaker.

The phenomenological argument expressed by equation (13) can be modiﬁed to address

The results for the cases tA/tp = 0.1, 0.5, 1 are shown in Figure 5. The compensated spectra

[16] predicts an index α = 4, which for this particular problem corresponds again approxi-

mately to the case tA/tp = 1/2. A higher power index α

4.9 is instead obtained for the

∼

very weak forcing case tA/tp = 0.1.

A rather technical but important issue when determining spectra is whether the dissi-

pation range is well resolved. We have considered here an exact laplacian dissipation term

in the dynamical equations (i.e. no hyperviscosity is used) which makes harder to achieve

higher spatial resolutions. An example from a simulation with tA/tp = 1 is shown in Fig-

ure 6. A k-dependent Reynolds number is computed as Rk = uk/(k ν) =

(Eu

k /k)/ν. The

q

dissipative region in k-space is characterized by Rk ∼
tonically and falls below unity at the largest values of k, is compelling evidence that the

1. The fact that Rk reduces mono-

dissipation range is well resolved in our simulations. Similar results are obtained for the

diﬀerent values of tA/tp, although higher perpendicular resolution is required as this value is

increased. For tA/tp = 2 the excessive computational requirement has forced us to consider

a lower value of S = 800 to resolve the dissipation range. Another direct resolution study is

shown in Figure 7 where diﬀerent perpendicular spatial resolutions have been adopted for a

simulation with tA/tp = 0.1. What this ﬁgure shows is that the spectrum is better resolved

11

and extends to higher wavenumbers as the resolution is increased. However, a very good

picture of the lower k part of the spectra can still be obtained with the low resolution runs.

VI. SPATIAL STRUCTURES

Figure 8 is a cross section of the simulation box (perpendicular to the strong external

magnetic ﬁeld) showing the spatial distribution of electric current density (z-component) at

t = 120tA for the cases tA/tp = 0.1 (Figure 8a) and tA/tp = 0.5 (Figure 8b). Intense positive

z currents correspond to white regions, while intense negative z current concentrations are

indicated in black. The current density structures extend in the z-direction (not shown)

with almost no variation (as consistent with the RMHD approximation) in a current sheet-

like form. These structures are highly dynamic in the x, y plane and evolve in time. They

indicate the presence of multiple reconnection events (where the reconnecting magnetic ﬁeld

lies in the plane perpendicular to the external ﬁeld) occurring within the turbulent non-linear

dynamics.

The minimum thickness that current sheets can reach is determined by the magnetic

diﬀusivity. In numerical simulations of turbulent regimes, the magnetic diﬀusivity is usually

made as small as possible, in such a way that the sheet thickness (which is about the smallest

spatial feature expected in these simulations) is just marginally resolved. The two cases

presented in Figure 8 share the same value of magnetic diﬀusivity (S = 2000), and in fact

it is possible to ﬁnd very narrow current sheets in both cases, close to the resolution limit.

Both cases correspond to statistically steady regimes. Nonetheless, the case corresponding

to the less intense forcing (tA/tp = 0.1 in Figure 8a), shows a comparatively fewer number

of current sheets. Therefore, the number of current sheets seems to be controlled by the

intensity of the forcing. The widths of these current sheets on the other hand, are mostly

determined by the dynamics. As a result, in both cases a wide range of current sheet widths

can be observed.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We presented results of the turbulent dynamics of a bundle of magnetic ﬂux ropes driven

at their endpoints with steady convective motions. Two dimensionless parameters control-

ling the response of the system are identiﬁed: the dissipation coeﬃcient and the ratio between

the Alfven wave box crossing time to the forcing timescale, tA/tp. As we showed in a previous

work [25], the dissipation rate strongly depends on the value of this timescale ratio, and is

only weakly dependent on the dissipation coeﬃcient. It is found that the external driving

generates a broadband perpendicular energy spectrum with a slope which is determined by

the timescale ratio tA/tp. For small values of this ratio, a spectrum with slope α

2.4 is

≈ −

obtained. For tA/tp ∼
regime known as weak turbulence. For higher values of tA/tp the spectrum approaches the

k−2
⊥ , which would indicate a realization of the

0.5 the spectrum is

∼

Kolmogorov form k

. Both the weak turbulent and the Kolmogorov spectra can be ob-

−5/3
⊥

tained from a common phenomenological framework based on the assumed value of the time

for decay of triple correlations. The regime corresponding to spectral power laws with slope

-2.4 and lower for low values of tA/tp should be attributed to the relatively small amplitude

ﬂow at the boundaries. The phenomenological framework can be modiﬁed to consider this

weak velocity ﬁeld case and a steep magnetic spectrum

k−3
⊥ is obtained. We also show the

∼

development of small scale spatial structures, in the form of current sheets oriented along

the mean ﬁeld. The number of current sheets seems to be controlled by the timescale ratio

tA/tp, while the widths of these current sheets on the other hand, are mostly determined by

the dynamics. A wide range of current sheet widths can be observed. The system presented

here should be consider as an example of the eﬀect of the boundaries on MHD turbulence.

To our knowledge, there is a lack of such studies in the literature and further investigation

along these lines should be extended to other MHD systems (3D MHD, compressible) as

well.

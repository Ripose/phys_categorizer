Abstract
In two previous publications[1],[2], we have demonstrated that stationary rotation of magnetized
plasma about a compact central object permits an enormous number of diﬀerent MHD instabilities,
with the well-known magneto-rotational instability[3],[4],[5] as just one of them. We here concentrate
on the new instabilities found that are driven by transonic transitions of the poloidal ﬂow. A
particularly promising class of instabilities, from the point of view of MHD turbulence in accretion
disks, is the class of trans-slow Alfv´en continuum modes, that occur when the poloidal ﬂow exceeds
a critical value of the slow magnetosonic speed. When this happens, virtually every magnetic/ﬂow
surface of the disk becomes unstable with respect to highly localized modes of the continuous
spectrum. The mode structures rotate, in turn, about the rotating disk. These structures lock
and become explosively unstable when the mass of the central object is increased beyond a certain
critical value. Their growth rates then become huge, of the order of the Alfv´en transit time. These
instabilities appear to have all requisite properties to facilitate accretion ﬂows across magnetic
surfaces and jet formation.

INTRODUCTION

In Fig. 1, a Magnetized Accretion-Ejection Structure is shown which illustrates the prob-
lem we wish to address in this paper, viz.: How does an accretion ﬂow about a compact
object ﬁrst crosses the magnetic conﬁguration and then turns the corner with respect to
the accretion disk to produce jets? In ideal MHD, plasma and magnetic ﬁeld stay together
(frozen in ﬁeld), so that a sizeable resistivity is needed for the ﬂow to detach from the mag-
netic ﬁeld. This involves anomalous dissipation. Hence, the basic problem is to ﬁnd relevant
local instabilities producing the necessary MHD turbulence.

FIG. 1: (a) Stationary end state from simulation with VAC[6] (Versatile Advection Code): disk
density surfaces (brown), jet magnetic surface (grey), helical ﬁeld lines (yellow), accretion-ejection
particle trajectory (red); (b) Accretion ﬂow detaching from the disk. [ From computations by Casse
and Keppens[7],[8] ].

Our model is shown in Fig. 2: An axisymmetric conﬁguration of nested magnetic / ﬂow
surfaces with magnetic ﬁeld indicated by the vectorial Alfv´en speed b and velocity v, having
both toroidal and poloidal components, surrounds a compact object of mass M
in the origin.
∗
Note that the usual tokamak conﬁguration is obtained for M
= 0, whereas accretion disk
∗
geometries may have ﬂat (thin disk) as well as round (thick disk) poloidal cross-sections.[9]
This model considers laboratory and astrophysical toroidal plasmas on an equal footing by
exploiting the scale independence[10] of the MHD equations.

In order to obtain a stationary equilibrium situation, we assume that the accretion ﬂow
speed is much smaller than both rotation speeds of the disk. We then need to determine the
stationary equilibrium ﬂows (Sec. 2) and, next, the local instabilities driven by the transonic
ﬂow (Sec.3). We analyze this problem from two angles:
(a) Asymptotic analysis for small inverse aspect ratio (ǫ
(b) Large-scale exact numerical computations of the equilibria and instabilities.
These will be discussed in reverse order since the numerical results suggest the relevant
approximations that may be made.

A diﬃculty encountered is that transonic transitions upset the standard equilibrium–

stability split. We will discuss this in Sec. 2 under the heading of transonic enigma.

II. TRANSONIC EQUILIBRIUM FLOWS

We exploit a variational principle for the stationary axisymmetric equilibria

determining the poloidal ﬂux ψ and the poloidal Alfv´en Mach number squared M 2

which have to be ﬁxed by whatever observational evidence is available. Note that the
ﬂux function (6) has been renamed K (instead of the usual L) to eliminate the confusion
derived from the frequent occurrence of the misnomer ‘speciﬁc angular momentum’ in the
astrophysics literature (see references in Ref. [2]). This is important since one of the essential
problems in accretion disk dynamics is precisely the transport of angular momentum.

The transonic enigma mentioned above is due to the fact that the ﬂows suddenly
change character from elliptic to hyperbolic at the transonic transitions. As a result, standard
(tokamak) equilibrium solvers diverge in the hyperbolic regimes! We circumvent this problem
by calculating in elliptic regimes beyond the ﬁrst hyperbolic one. Obviously, the payoﬀ is
that we cannot approach the transonic transitions but have to infer what has happened
there from the changes in the dynamics found in the ‘transonic’ elliptic regimes.

The pleasing side of the transonic enigma is that the time-dependence of the linear waves
and the spatial dependence of the nonlinear stationary states are intimately related. This is
seen by comparing the wave spectra, which cluster at the slow, Alfv´en, and fast continuum
for highly localized modes (Fig. 3), and the corresponding
frequencies

By means of the transonic equilibrium solver FINESSE (described in Ref. [12]) typical
equilibria in the ﬁrst trans-slow elliptic regime have been computed for tokamak and
accretion disk (Figs. 5, and 6) for a representative choice of the ﬂux function parameters:

FIG. 5: Equilibrium for tokamak (Γ = 0).

Note that the accretion disk equilibrium, in contrast to the tokamak, has the density
peaking on the outside to produce overall equilibrium on the ﬂux / ﬂow surfaces with respect
to the gravitational pull of the compact object in the center. For the sake of the spectral
calculations (Sec. 3), the two equilibria have been chosen such that the safety factor q(ψ) is
a monotonically increasing function.

III. LOCAL TRANSONIC INSTABILITIES

With equilibrium ﬂows, the overall spectral structure of MHD waves and instabilities
is determined by the split in forward and backward waves so that the local waves cluster at
the Doppler shifted continuous spectra:

These are embedded in a monotonic spectral structure for 1D equilibria, as shown in Fig. 7.
A long-standing puzzle about the nature of the singular frequencies Ω0 (
v) has been
clariﬁed in Ref. [13]: In the Eulerian description, these frequencies give rise to the Eulerian
entropy continua (ΩE), not perturbing the pressure, velocity, and magnetic ﬁeld, and, hence,
absent in the Lagrangian description.

enough time to saturate during a ﬁnite number of revolutions of the plasma.

Since these modes are localized both radially (because of the continuous spectrum) and in
the angle ϑ (and ϕ) they are perfectly suitable to produce the turbulence that is needed along
the accretion ﬂow at the inner edge of the accretion disk with respect to the central object to
detach the ﬂow from the magnetic ﬁeld.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

(1) In the presence of poloidal rotation, the singular structure of the MHD continua transfers
to the equilibrium, so that linear waves and non-linear stationary equilibrium ﬂows are no
longer separate issues.

cretion disks with transonic ﬂows exploiting our new computational tools FINESSE (for
equilibria) and PHOENIX (for stability).

(3) We have found a large class of instabilities of the continuous spectra of transonic ax-
isymmetric equilibria for M 2 > M 2
c .

(4) These instabilities may cause strong MHD turbulence and associated anomalous dissi-
pation, breaking the co-moving constraint of plasma and magnetic ﬁeld and facilitating both
accretion and ejection of jets from accretion disks.

Abstract. Using techniques of eﬀective ﬁeld theory, we consider the thermodynam-
ical properties of a dilute two-dimensional plasma interacting via a 1/r potential. The
ﬁrst one-loop correction to the partition function is already logarithmically divergent
in the eﬀective theory. The ﬁnite part of the one-loop induced couplings is then explic-
itly evaluated by matching the density-density correlator in the eﬀective theory and in
the full quantum theory. This task is performed from the formulation of the Coulomb
problem in momentum space by projecting the two-dimensional momentum space onto
the surface of a three-dimensional sphere. We also report some higher order results
that, in the case of the one-component plasma immersed in a uniform neutralizing
background, are resummed to obtain the complete leading-log partition function.

1. Introduction

An application of eﬀective ﬁeld theory methods, which have become commonplace in
high-energy physics and nuclear physics, has been achieved very recently by Brown
and Yaﬀe [1] to analyze some general equilibrium properties of non-relativistic classical
In an exhaustive work, these authors have systematically derived a couple
plasmas.
of higher-order results concerning with the thermodynamics and have computed some
correlation functions of the three-dimensional classical plasma. Although of some of
those results were known, the computation is streamlined by the organization inherent
in the technique of eﬀective interactions.

The two-dimensional electron gas with 1/r interactions is both a fundamental model
in many-body physics and a system of current experimental interest. Electrons trapped
on the liquid-helium surface or electrons conﬁned in the vicinity of a junction between a
semiconductor and insulators or between layers of diﬀerent semiconductors are examples
of two-dimensional electron systems [2]. At ﬁnite temperature, the parameter nλ2
measures the dilution of the system and the dimensionless coupling parameter deﬁned
by g = 2πnβ2e4 characterizes the strength of Coulomb interactions, where λ denotes
the thermal wavelength and e is the eﬀective electronic charge in unrationalized units.
For electrons on a helium ﬁlm the electron density can be varied in the range from 105
cm−2 to 109 cm−2. For these low densities, it appears that the electrons form classical
two-dimensional systems even at temperatures of a few millidegrees Kelvin. For T
1
K and 105 < n < 106 cm−2, the range of the plasma parameter is 1.7 < g < 17, not
very far from the domain of weak coupling.

∼

In this paper, we largely pursue the methods advocated by Brown and Yaﬀe,
and consider a classical two-dimensional multi-component plasma interacting via the
Coulomb potential. From the appropriate scalar ﬁeld theory, we compute the partition
function and the correlation functions to ﬁrst nontrivial order requiring renormalization.
The analytical results that we have derived are valid in the low density and weak
coupling domain where nλ2
1. The essential ingredients in the calculation
are the matching coeﬃcients or induced couplings, whose ﬁnite parts are determined
from a comparison of the short-distance behaviours in the eﬀective theory and in the
full quantum theory. The main result of this paper is precisely the computation of
the matching coeﬃcients, exploiting some properties in the momentum space of the
Coulomb Green’s function for the quantum problem.

There are old analytical and numerical results on the two-dimensional one-

These expressions agree precisely with our results (38) and (40) for the pressure and
the internal energy when the ratio of the Coulomb energy of a pair of charged particles
separated by a thermal length to the thermal energy is very large, η = βe2/λ
1.
However, as we will show below, our one-loop results do not imply restriction to this
ratio. They are valid to order g for arbitrary η. The terms of order g2 retained by
Chalupa and Totsuji are not reliable because they must be computed by matching with
unknown results of a three-body calculation in the quantum theory. However, we have
been able to compute all the gn(ln g)n leading logarithmic terms of the partition function
in (57).

The plan of this paper is arranged as follows. In section 2 we brieﬂy review the
structure of the eﬀective theory, the partition function to one-loop order and write

the number density correlators. The section 4 is devoted to report some higher order
results concerning the leading logarithmic contribution to the partition function. A
short conclusion is presented in section 5. Details of the derivation of the basic formulae
for the matching procedure are given in the appendix.

2. One-loop divergences in the eﬀective theory

We consider a plasma of diﬀerent species of charged particles interacting through the
Coulomb interaction. The charge, mass,. . . of the species a are denoted by ea, ma,. . . .
These are the conventions of [1] which we shall closely follow. In the classical limit, the
a (p) = eβµae−βp2/2ma,
free-particle distribution function reduces to a gaussian function f 0
and the free-particle density in two dimensions is n0

which gives rise to the interaction potential in ν spatial dimensions

As usual, in the absence of any scale, the analytically continued coincidence limit Vν(0)

turned via a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation into the functional integral

This eﬀective ﬁeld theory can be systematically obtained from the quantum
statistical mechanics of the plasma by integration of the quantum ﬁelds with momentum
scales of order λ−1 or larger [1].
In addition to the terms already present in (7),
there are sub-leading contributions in a derivative expansion in powers of (λ∂φ). The
ﬁrst of these comes from the static non-interacting two-point charge density-charge
density correlation at non-vanishing k and zero frequency, evaluated within the Maxwell-
Boltzmann statistics. This reads

where the piece independent upon k produces the Debye screening included in (7) and
the next term yields an action contribution linear in the particle densities,

where we have used the form of the Debye wave number.

In the following, we safely use the eﬀective theory of equation (7) to describe
distance scales of order λ and larger. Although this classical regime is independent
of the quantum statistics, the logarithmic ultraviolet divergences in the eﬀective theory
are related to quantum properties of the full theory. These divergences of the form
ln(κ0/µ), where µ is a momentum scale introduced by dimensional regularization, must
match onto counterterms proportional to ln(µλ) arising from the action with the induced
couplings required to cancel the µ dependence. The precise value of the ﬁnite part of
the induced couplings is determined by comparison with the result of the computation
of some quantity in the full quantum theory. The main result of this work is justly the
explicit evaluation of the one-loop induced couplings.

The dimensionless loop expansion parameter is the ratio of the Coulomb energy
for two particles separated by a Debye length to their average kinetic energy in the
plasma. This plasma parameter is g = βe2κ0. Apart from the Debye length, there is
another relevant length scale, not directly entering into the eﬀective theory, but playing
an important role in the matching procedure. This is the Bohr radius (e2mab)−1 or,
equivalently, the binding energy e4mab/2 of two particles in the plasma with reduced
mass mab and equal and opposite charge.

The Green’s function Gν(r

In the case of a plasma consisting of a single species immersed in a uniform
neutralizing background, the terms of order ǫ2 and ǫ2 ln ǫ which appear in the equation
of state reported by Chalupa [4] agree precisely with our result (38) when the strong
repulsion result (A.39) is inserted

5. Conclusion

With Brown and Yaﬀe as a guide, we have shown how the technique of eﬀective ﬁeld
theory can be used in order to compute the partition function of the classical two-
dimensional plasma interacting via a 1/r potential. Renormalization in the eﬀective
theory is essential already to one-loop level, and two-body induced couplings are required
to order e4. We have performed in detail the computation of the ﬁnite part of these
couplings by exploiting the properties of the Coulomb Green’s function in momentum
space. We have derived explicit expressions for the one-loop equilibrium properties,
without restriction on the quantum parameter ηab = βeaeb/λab. The higher order
induced couplings satisfy renormalization group equations which can be solved in the
leading logarithmic approximation. In the case of one-component plasma, we have been
able to derive the asymptotic series of leading logs for the partition function in terms
of the incomplete Gamma function.

where the contour C encircles clockwise the cut along the positive real E axis and all
the bound-state poles when e2 < 0 in the case of an attractive potential. To exploit the
rotational symmetry of the problem and the properties on momentum space, it proves
convenient to average over the angle of k and compute the spatial integral making use

of the two-dimensional
Coulomb problem. This form has been given in [8] following the clever treatment of
Schwinger [7]. Let us summarize the main results concerning this Green’s function. The

Now, consider the asymptotic behavior when

the leading contribution comes from the lowest bound state, as it is easily noted from
the dependence on e−βH. Hence, all we need is the residue
of the integrand

To obtain the leading asymptotic behavior in the case of strong repulsion,
proves convenient to study separately the contribution counterclockwise around the
ramiﬁcation point t = 0, and the contribution from the discontinuity of G+(k, E) at the
cut along the positive real axis. As we shall see, the discontinuity yields exponentially
small corrections. Using the identity

The last term in the second line produces an integral well deﬁned for y > 0, which can
be studied by inserting the representation of tanh z as a series of exponentials. The

where B2n are the Bernoulli numbers. The angular integral of e−tG+(k, E) produces

(A.17), the sum over m in (A.12) gives a factor Pl(cos 2θ). Now, the integration over p

Abstract

I theoretically found eigenmodes and growth rates of relativistic current ﬁlamentation instability

in collisional regimes, deriving a generalized dispersion relation from self-consistent beam-Maxwell

equations. For symmetrically counterstreaming, fully relativistic electron currents, the collisional

coupling between electrons and ions creates the unstable modes of growing oscillation and wave,

which stand out for long-wavelength perturbations. In the stronger collisional regime, the growing

oscillatory mode tends to be dominant for all wavelengths. In the collisionless limit, those modes

vanish, while maintaining another purely growing mode that exactly coincides with a standard

relativistic Weibel mode. It is also shown that the eﬀects of electron-electron collisions and thermal

spread lower the growth rate of the relativistic Weibel instability. The present mechanisms of

ﬁlamentation dynamics are essential for transport of homogeneous electron beam produced by the

interaction of high power laser pulses with plasma.

INTRODUCTION

Relativistic laser-plasma interactions have been a topical issue for the past decade [1], in

the context of ignitor physics of inertial conﬁnement fusion, aiming at additional fast heating

and subsequent ignition of highly compressed targets by means of an external intense laser

pulse [2]. The laser pulse drives relativistic currents, compensating return currents, and

creates a pattern of counterpropagating currents which are subject to current ﬁlamentation

instabilities (CFI) including the Weibel mode [3]. In the theoretical arena, numerous ver-

sions of analytical and numerical methods have been developed in the past, to explore this

type of instabilities [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. In general, the physical

mechanism of the electromagnetic CFI is explained as follows: When the compensation of

the counterpropagating electron currents is disturbed in the transverse direction, magnetic

repulsion between the two currents reinforces the initial disturbance. As a consequence, a

larger and larger magnetic ﬁeld is produced as time increases, degrading the transport prop-

erties. Many eﬀorts have been devoted to this crucial problem, both related to laboratory

electron beams [18, 19, 20] as well as to astrophysics [21, 22, 23]. Concerning laser interac-

tion with plasmas, for the low (nonrelativistic) intensity regimes the inverse bremsstrahlung

absorption is known to predominate around the cutoﬀ region, where the Weibel-type in-

stability associated with temperature anisotropy can take place [24, 25].

In the ablative

plasmas, the collisional and related nonlocal eﬀects were investigated [26].

The original motivation for this work was triggered by more recent publications that have

been quantitatively treated with the counterstreaming relativistic CFI in the collisionless

limit [27, 28, 29]. A series of works could be linked with the ignitor physics by irradiating a

relativistic laser pulse: Fast ignition of the compressed fuel requires at least 10

100 kJ of

−

external energy to be deposited within

10 ps into the precompressed core [30]. If carried

by 1

10 MeV electrons, it implies a current of 0.1

−

of about 100 kA [31], by more than a factor

1 GA which exceeds the transport limit
103. The essential feature is the breakup of the

−

relativistic electron beam into many ﬁlaments when propagating in dense plasma [32, 33].

The physics underlying this phenomenon is just the CFI as mentioned above. This type of

instability leads to nonlinear ﬁlamentation and coalescence of the relativistic electron beam

[7, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38] and the formation of strong magnetic ﬁelds [35, 36, 37, 39, 40]. In the

astronomical point of view, one often encounters such morphology in a variety of celestial

∼

∼

2

objects, particularly, in the astrophysical jets [41]. State-of-the-art observations by utilizing

very long baseline interferometry have revealed the ﬁlamentary structure of the jets [42],

involving transverse magnetic ﬁelds [43]. More recently, large-scale toroidal magnetic ﬁelds

have been discovered in the Galactic Center [44], accompanied with splendid ﬁlamentary

radio arcs [45, 46].

Regarding the ignitor physics of laboratory plasmas, the eﬀects of collisions and beam

thermal spread play a signiﬁcant role in the CFI caused by the ultrahigh relativistic currents
1021 cm−3 (cutoﬀ
through ablative coronal plasma [37], whose density rises from nc ≈
102 µm
density) to

1026 cm−3 (a thousand times solid density), over a radial distance of

∼

∼

[47]. The role of collisions in a laser-produced plasma has been discussed in the early

literature by Motz [48], though the description was restricted to the nonrelativistic fashion.

It is important to note that the collision frequency invokes additional parameter disturbing
the universal density scaling, in terms of the time scale of a plasma oscillation period ω−1
pe

and the spatioscale of a skin depth c/ωpe, which is valid only for collisionless regimes. In

fully relativistic regimes, the collision cross section should be evaluated by using the Mott

scattering formula [49]. Presuming a small angle scattering and averaging over the angle yield
the electron-ion collision frequency that can be deﬁned as νei = (niYei/c3)(Γ/µ3), where ni is
the number density of ions, Yei = 4π( ¯Ze2/m0)2lnΛ, Γ = (1 + µ2)1/2, µ = pe/m0c, and pe, m0,
¯Z, and lnΛ are the electron momentum, the electron rest mass, the averaged charge number,

and the Coulomb logarithm, respectively [50], and the electron-electron collision frequency
is given as νee = (2/ ¯Z)νei. Introducing the current neutral condition of nb/np ≃ |
where nb, np, and vp are the beam electron density, the plasma electron density, and its
(m0c2)−3/2(ni/nb)3lnΛ
velocity, respectively, we ﬁnd the ratio of νei/ωpe ≃
1021 cm−3 to be almost constant,
for the plasma return current. When assuming nb ∼

lative corona are expected to be thermalized via the collisional and collisionless dissipative

processes [36]. The thermal eﬀects involved with the ratio of the transverse temperature to

∼

less than unity [37], which also disturbs the aforementioned scaling.

In this paper, I present fundamental eigenmode properties and growth rates in the linear

stage of the CFI including the eﬀects that violate the universal density scaling. The theory

is expanded in fully relativistic regime on the basis of the self-consistent beam-Maxwell

equations. To the best of my knowledge, a comprehensive treatment of electron-electron

and electron-ion collisional eﬀects on relativistic counterstreaming electron currents with

thermal spread has not been carried out, so far. For the symmetrically counterstreaming

currents, I found that collisional and thermal eﬀects are likely to lower the growth rate of

the relativistic Weibel instability. The most signiﬁcant result is that the ﬁnite collisional

coupling between electron and ion creates the growing oscillatory and the growing wave

modes, which stand out for long-wavelength perturbations, and in the moderate to strong

collisional regime, even for short-wavelength perturbations, the growth rate of the oscillatory

mode exceeds that of the suppressed Weibel instability. In this aspect, the present work goes

beyond the framework of the well-established theory of electromagnetic instabilities. The

asymmetric conﬁguration eﬀects of the counterstreaming currents are also investigated by

using a slow return current approximation. Furthermore, I argue that the collisional coupling

between electron and electron creates a growing wave mode, but its growth rate is lower than

that of the suppressed Weibel instability. It is also shown that thermal eﬀects participate

in lowering the growth rate of the Weibel instability. Although, in the case that includes

thermal corrections, the present calculation is valid for the smaller wave number k as shown

later, the most interesting range k

ωpe/c can be fairly covered.

∼

In order to spell out these subjects, the present paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II,

the linear theoretical analysis of the relativistic CFI is expanded systematically. The basic

equations introduced in Sec. II A are linearized so as to obtain a dispersion relation of the

CFI along the manner outlined in the Appendix. The generic dispersion relation is pre-

sented in Sec. II B, and its approximate expressions are derived in Sec. II C. In Sec. III, for

an application, the newly derived equations are solved for typical parameters of counter-

streaming relativistic currents, and the properties of complex eigenmodes are investigated

for the cases including the eﬀects of electron-electron collision (Sec. III A), electron-ion colli-

sion (Sec. III B), thermal corrections (Sec. III C), and for the special case without collisional

and thermal eﬀects (Sec. III D), as well as, for the case with an asymmetrical conﬁguration

4

of counterstreaming currents (Sec. III E), closely relevant to ignitor physics. As a matter of

convenience, formulas of the growth rates are explicitly written down for some interesting

cases. Finally, Sec. IV is devoted to concluding remarks.

II. GENERALIZED DISPERSION RELATION OF THE RELATIVISTIC

CURRENT FILAMENTATION INSTABILITY

A. Basic equations and assumptions

Begin with the nonlinear beam-Maxwell equations that include both friction and pres-

sure terms. Assuming the ions to be at rest and to provide a uniform charge-neutralizing

background, we study the relativistic dynamics of two uniform, counterstreaming electron

currents by employing the following set of equations in the dimensionless form,

ponents and ¯a labels the countercomponent of a, viz., ¯a = 2, 1 for a = 1, 2, respectively. In

p

particular, νei and νee describe the electron-ion and electron-electron momentum exchanges,

and the other notations are standard. For normalization, I have used the initially uniform

density n0, the speed of light c, and the electron plasma frequency ωpe =

4πn0e2/m0.

Note that the Poisson Eq. (6) is equivalent to a combination of the continuity Eq. (2) and

p

the Ampere-Maxwell Eq. (5).

According to a procedure similar to that developed by Califano et al. [27], I investigate

the behavior of small amplitude perturbations by linearizing Eqs. (2)

(5). I impose current

−

neutrality of

a n0,av0,a = 0, where v0,a = v0,aˆx are the initial velocities in x direction.
Under the current neutrality, there exists no magnetic ﬁeld initially. The CFI is studied

P

in the x-y plane.

In order to derive the dispersion relation, all perturbed quantities are

assumed to be in the form of

(y, t) =

exp[i(kyy

ωt)]. As a result, a magnetic ﬁeld

F

−

B = (0, 0, Bz) and a corresponding electric ﬁeld E = (Ex, Ey, 0) are generated. The purely

transverse mode is investigated in detail throughout this paper, i.e., kx = 0 and ky = k
whereas the longitudinal mode such as two-stream instability with kx 6
taken into account at the moment. The pressure of each electron components is connected

= 0 and ky = 0 is not

= 0,

with its density by a polytropic relation, which depends on the characteristic frequency ω

and wave number k of the mode being considered. As it is well known, in the case that

the ratio of ω/k is much larger than the electron thermal speed, the adiabatic exponent of
γe = 3 is adequate for the polytrope [48, 51]. Henceforth, I assumed Pa/n3
Pa = 3T0,a∇
∇
ions are supposed to be ﬁxed on the short time scale of

na. Then, we get a closed form of the linearized Eqs. (2)

ω−1
pe . Along these assumptions,

(5). The background

a = const, so that

−

∼

in the nonrelativistic limit Eqs. (2)

(6) involve the resistive transverse wave modes and

−

longitudinal wave mode with thermal correction which were discussed in Ref. [48].

B. The dispersion relation including collisional eﬀects and thermal corrections

The extended dispersion relation of the relativistic CFI including collisional and thermal

eﬀects is then found self-consistently. In collisionless cases the dispersion relation that can
be expressed as functions of ω2 and (k/ω)2 does not include the imaginary unit i = √

1
−
explicitly and contains the purely real and purely imaginary solutions of ω(k) [27]. The

purely real solutions consist of the pairs of the positive and negative solutions, correspond-

ing to purely oscillatory and/or purely oscillatory wave modes, while the purely imaginary

solutions are concomitant with the complex conjugate solutions, to yield purely growing and

purely decaying (damped) modes.

In the collisional case considered here, the dispersion relation includes the imaginary unit

explicitly. Hence, the solutions of ω(k) may depart from the real and imaginary axis in the

complex plane. In this sense, hereafter we refer to such solutions, i.e., complex eigenmodes

6

6
with real and imaginary part, as dephasing modes. Below, I explicitly write down the

generalized dispersion relation containing the dephasing modes. After some manipulations

outlined in the Appendix, the dispersion relation can be obtained in the complex form of

III. EIGENMODE PROPERTIES AND GROWTH RATES OF THE

RELATIVISTIC CURRENT FILAMENTATION INSTABILITY IN A

COLLISIONAL PLASMA

In the following, we ﬁnd the solutions contained in the approximate dispersion Eqs. (15),

(21), (26), and (28). The complex eigenmodes are explicitly written down, and surveyed for

wide parameter ranges of counterstreaming relativistic currents.

A. Eigenmodes including electron-electron collisional eﬀects

At ﬁrst, I seek the solutions of Eq. (15) in terms of ω. Let us consider the symmetrical

conﬁguration of counterstreaming currents such as n0,1 = n0,2 = 0.5 [33], having v0,1 =

v0,2.

The choice of the parameters may be instructive for making a direct comparison between

the present results and the previous ones [27]. Equation (15) can be then cast to

The ﬁrst factor of (left-hand side) (lhs) of Eq. (29) yields a simple electrostatic mode,

corresponding to the relativistic plasma oscillation: ω =

ωr and ωi = 0, where

Below, we refer to this eigenmode as oscillatory mode (o mode). It turns out that momentum

exchange between electrons and electrons does not disturb the plasma oscillation.

The second factor of lhs of Eq. (29) contains four solutions. The values of ω′2 are connected
with ω2 through the complex operator in Eq. (30). Therefore, in contrast to collisionless
cases, ω2 values are of complex, to give

collision parameter ˜νee. The trajectories of ω can be compared to those of the arrowhead of
vectors. In the collisionless limit of ˜νee →

and purely decaying (θ0n −

π/2) mode. The unstable mode just represents the

π =

−

later.

As shown in Fig. 1(a) for k = 3

10−3, for the small but ﬁnite value of ˜νee the vectors of
the n mode depart clockwise from the imaginary axis. As ˜νee increases, the real components

×

of the vectors increase, while the imaginary components decrease. In this aspect, such a

growing wave mode is considered to be the dephasing Weibel mode with reduced growth

rate. In the strong collisional regime, the polar angles of the vectors of the growing and
decaying mode approach θ0n = π/4 and θ0n −
shrink, reducing both their real and imaginary components. The vectors of the p mode do

3π/4, respectively, and the vectors

π =

−

not largely depart from the real axis for the small value of k.

As seen in Fig. 1(b), for the moderate value of k = 3

10−1, the trajectories of the n mode

×

are similar to those for the smaller k value. As for the vectors of the p mode, I now ﬁnd the

clockwise deviation from the real axis. This represents the decaying (θ0p < 0) and growing

(θ0p + π < π) electromagnetic mode. In the moderate collisional regime, the magnitude of

the deviation angles tends to be large, though the maximum value is found to be small,

compared with that for the n mode. In the strong collisional regime, the vectors of the p

mode are likely to return to the real axis, reducing their magnitude. For comparison, the

ﬁxed vectors of the o mode are also plotted in the Fig. 1 (a,b). In these cases, the magnitude

of the vectors is larger than that of the p and n mode.

For the p and n mode, the angular frequency of the oscillations can be deﬁned by ωr(µ =

µ+) = ω0pcosθ0p > 0 and ωr(µ = µ−) = ω0ncosθ0n ≥
ω0psinθ0p ≥
rate can be deﬁned by γ(µ = µ+) =

respectively. They are summarized as follows:

0, respectively; and the linear growth

+ sgn(µ)α(k2, ˜νee, Γ0)

.

(36b)

Here, note the relation of ωr(µ+) > γ(µ+) and ωr(µ−) < γ(µ−).

In Fig. 2 for v0 = 0.9, I show the growth rate γ of Eq. (36b) as a function of the wave

number k for given collision parameters ˜νee = 0.1, 1, and 10. For the n mode, it is found

that the collisional eﬀects lower the growth rate for all k, maintaining the dependence of

γ

k for small value of k, as well as, the saturation property for large value of k. Such

∝

asymptotic properties of the growth rate can be also seen in the purely growing Weibel

mode in a collisionless plasma [27, 28]. In addition, the collisional eﬀects create the p mode

k2 and γ

due to the dephasing mechanism mentioned above. The growth rate has the dependence of
k−1 in the small- and large-k region, respectively, taking a peak around the

γ
∝
moderate value of k. Such a peak tends to be prominent for ˜νee ∼
as ˜νee further increases, as consistent with Fig. 1(b). As a result, the growth rate cannot

O(1), and then decreases

∝

exceed that of the n mode corresponding to the dephasing Weibel mode with reduced growth

rate. Within the present framework, it seems that both modes do not deﬁnitely cut oﬀ the

growth of short wavelength perturbations.

In Fig. 3, for v0 = 0.9 and ˜νee = 1, I show the growth rate γ as a function of the angular

frequency ωr of Eq. (36a), varying the wave number k as a parameter. The growth rate of

the n mode turns out to be larger than that of the p mode for all k, which is in contrast with

the case including only electron-ion collisional eﬀects, as shown in Fig. 8 later. Moreover, I

−3/2
found that the angular frequencies of the p and n mode are separated at ωr = Γ
0

0.29,

≃

and the oscillation frequency of the p mode is always higher than that of the n mode. The

separation frequency, where ∂ωr/∂k

+0, is lower than the frequency of Eq. (31) for the

→

o mode, i.e. the plasma cutoﬀ frequency. The relation of ∂ωr/∂k > 0 for both the p and

n mode ensures that the direction of the group velocities coincides with that of the phase

velocities of carrier wave. For large value of k, the oscillation frequency of the p mode

goes far beyond the relativistic plasma frequency, while the growth rate decreases. These

properties again appear in the case including electron-ion collisional eﬀects (see also Fig. 8).

In Fig. 4 for v0 = 0.9, I show the growth rate γ as a function of the collision parameter

˜νee for given values of k = 0.01 and 1. It is found that for moderate value of ˜νee, the growth

rate of the p mode takes the peak value, which tends to be well pronounced especially for
10−2 at

In Fig. 5 for ˜νee = 1, I show the growth rate γ as a function of k for given values of

v0 = 0.5, 0.9, and 0.99, corresponding to Γ0 = 1.15 (79.0 keV), 2.29 (611 keV), and 7.09

(3.11 MeV), respectively. For small value of k, both the p and n mode seem to increase their

growth rates as Γ0 increases. For large value of k, however, such properties appear merely in

weak to mild relativistic regime. Namely, in strong relativistic regime, the growth for large

k tends to be suppressed, for example, as for the n mode, the saturation level of the growth

rate decreases as Γ0 increases. The peak of the growth rate of the p mode is likely to shift

to the smaller-k region, reducing its value. Although, the energy dependence of the n mode

appears again in the case including electron-ion collisional eﬀects, the p mode signiﬁcantly

changes its property, as shown below.

B. Eigenmodes including electron-ion collisional eﬀects

I seek the solutions of Eq. (21) in terms of ω. In the case of the symmetrically counter-

streaming currents with n0,1 = n0,2 = 0.5 and v0,1 =

v0,2, Eq. (21) can be cast to

mation Eq. (19), to provide the eigenmodes signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those derived from

Eq. (29). The ﬁrst factor of lhs of Eq. (37) contains a modiﬁed electrostatic mode of the rel-

ativistic plasma oscillation. The eigenmode may be written in the form of ω =

It is found that the dissipative eﬀects owing to the electron-ion collisions create the growing

and decaying oscillatory mode, which seemingly carries its phase toward

y and y direc-

−

tion, respectively. As far as ignoring thermal and asymmetrical eﬀects of counterstreaming

currents is concerned, this mode is independent of wave number, so that the group velocity
is null. Note that in the collisionless limit of ˜νei →

0, Eq. (38) reduces to Eq. (31) which

19

denotes the relativistic plasma oscillation. In this sense, we refer to the eigenmode identiﬁed

by Eq. (38), for convenience, as o mode.

The second factor of lhs of Eq. (37) contains four complex solutions. Along the

manner explained in Sec. III A, I express the solutions in the polar coordinate form of

decrease, while the imaginary components increase. The magnitude of the deviation angles

is larger than that in the case including only electron-electron collisional eﬀects [compare

Fig. 1(a)].

In the strong collisional regime, the vectors shrink, reducing both their real

and imaginary components. This is the decaying and growing electromagnetic mode, which

possesses the allowed range of polar angle of

respectively. For the parameter range of ˜νei being considered, the vectors of the n mode

do not largely depart from the imaginary axis, that is, the purely growing Weibel mode is
not so dephased. The most remarkable property can be seen in the o mode. For ˜νei 6
the vectors leave the real axis, and as ˜νei increases the magnitude of the deviation angles

= 0,

increases. As consistent with Eq. (38), at ˜νei = 1 the vectors of the growing and decaying

oscillatory mode have the angles of 3π/4 and

π/4, respectively; and in the strong collisional

limit, asymptotically approach π/2 and

π/2, respectively.

In Fig. 6(b), for the moderate value of k = 3

10−1, I now clearly ﬁnd, for ˜νei 6

×

= 0, the

clockwise deviation of vector pairs of p, n, and o modes. This essentially means that all

modes are in phase lag, because of the frictional nature of collisions. The vectors of the p

and n mode exhibit the behavior similar to that displayed in Fig. 1(b). In contrast with the

case for small k, the polar angles of the vectors of the p mode cannot reach to 3π/4 and

−

−

21

π/4, and in the strong collisional regime the vectors are likely to return to the real axis,

−
reducing their magnitude. On the other hand, the vectors of the n mode largely deviate

from the imaginary axis until the angles reach to π/4 and

3π/4. In the weak collisional

−

regime, the vectors increase the real components and decrease the imaginary components,

whereas in the strong collisional regime, there is decrease both in the real and imaginary

components. As a result, the electron-ion collisional eﬀects lower the growth rate of the

n mode, namely, the dephasing Weibel mode. Note that the trajectories of the vectors of

the o mode are the same as those displayed in Fig. 6(a). For the moderate value of k, the

magnitude of the vectors of the n mode is found to be comparable to that of the o mode.

For the p and n mode, the angular frequency of the oscillations can be deﬁned by ωr(µ =

In Fig. 7 for v0 = 0.9, I show the growth rate γ of Eqs. (38) and (42b) as a function of

the wave number k for given collision parameters ˜νei = 0.1, 1, and 10. For the n mode, the

collisional eﬀects lower the growth rate, especially in the large-k region where the growth

rate tends to saturate. In contrast to the case including only electron-electron collisions,

the growth rate for small k, which has the dependence of γ

k, is found to be not so

∝

depressed due to the electron-ion collisional eﬀects (compare Fig. 2). The p and o mode,
which appear owing to the collisional eﬀects, are prominent for the parameter of ˜νei ∼
and suﬃciently surpass the n mode in growing long-wavelength (small-k) perturbations.

This feature is in major contrast to the case including only electron-electron collisional

In Fig. 8, for v0 = 0.9 and ˜νei = 1, I show γ of Eq. (42b) as a function of the angular

of k, the growth rate of the n mode is larger than that of the o mode, which is always

larger than that of the p mode. Note that, for the p and n mode, ∂ωr/∂k > 0, and the
angular frequencies of both modes are clearly separated at the frequency of ωr ≃
∂ωr/∂k

+0. As a result, the oscillation frequency of the p mode is always higher than

0.2, where

→

that of the n mode. These features could be also seen in Fig. 3 for the case including

electron-electron collisional eﬀects.

In Fig. 9, for v0 = 0.9, I show the growth rate γ of Eq. (38), and (42b) as a function of

the collision parameter ˜νei for given values of k = 0.01 and 1. In the weak collisional regime,

the growth rates of the o and p mode are both proportional to ˜νei, while the growth rate

of the n mode is almost constant. For smaller k, the growth rates of the o and p mode can

more readily exceed the growth rate of the n mode, and for the moderate value of ˜νei, they

take the peak values. The growth rate of the o mode can, even for large k, exceed that of
0.41 at ˜νei ≃

1.4. The growth rate decreases as ˜νei

the n mode, and takes the peak of γ

further increases, showing the dependence of γ

collisional regime, the growth rates of the p and n mode have the dependencies of γ

, respectively. As would be expected, anyhow, all modes are suppressed in the

and γ

strong collisional regime.

In Fig. 10 for ˜νei = 1, I show the growth rate γ of Eqs. (38) and (42b) as a function

of k for given values of v0 = 0.5 (Γ0 = 1.15), 0.9 (Γ0 = 2.29), and 0.99 (Γ0 = 7.09). It

should be remarked that for the lower current speed, the o mode becomes most dominant.

In contrast to the case including only electron-electron collisional eﬀects, the o and p mode

monotonically reduce their growth rates as Γ0 increases, and soon the o mode is overcome

by the n mode from large-k region. The energy dependence of the n mode is similar to

23

that shown in Fig. 5, namely, in weak to mild relativistic regime, the saturation level of the

growth rate increases as Γ0 increases, while in strong relativistic regime, it tends to decrease.

In small-k region, the growth rate seems to increase as Γ0 increases, since its curve, roughly

proportional to k, shifts to the smaller-k region. Such an apparent redshift can be also seen

in the large-k region for the p mode.

In contrast to Eqs. (31) and (38), we ﬁnd the thermal dispersion

terms characterized by
electrons [51]. In the limit of T0k2

Moreover, the second factor of lhs of Eq. (43) contains six solutions. Numerical calculation

indicates that these consist of four purely real solutions and a purely imaginary solution

concomitant with its complex conjugate: ω =

iωi. For the purely growing mode that is

show γ as a function of the wave number k for v0 = 0.9 and ˜T0 = 0.1, as an example. It is

found that the thermal eﬀects simply lower the growth rate of the purely growing Weibel

instability, at least, in the range of k

O(1). Note that in contrast to collisional cases,

∼

the thermal eﬀects do not take part in dephasing the purely oscillatory and purely growing

mode, but merely give rise to the mode-dispersion which can reduce the growth rate.

D. Eigenmodes of collisionless case without thermal corrections

In the collisionless limits without thermal corrections, the dephasing operators in Eqs. (19)

For another comparison, we are concerned with an asymmetrical conﬁguration of coun-

the ablative corona surrounding a highly compressed ignitor plasma.

˜νei,2 = 1, as an example. It is found that as a whole the wave number dependence itself

is similar to that for the symmetrically counterstreaming cases (compare Figs. 7 and 10).

The purely growing mode (˜νei,2 = 0: crosses) is disturbed due to the collisional eﬀects on

the slow return current to yield the n mode, namely, the dephasing Weibel mode. However,

the dephasing eﬀects result in only a slight increase of the growth rate. As shown in Fig. 12

(solid curve) for ˜νei,2 = 1 the increasing rate is about 14% at most around k

0.5. I mention

≃

that for the larger collision parameter, the growth rate of the n mode is depressed below that

for the collisionless (˜νei,2 = 0) case. In addition, the dephasing eﬀects create the unstable

modes analogous to the o and p mode that were introduced in Sec. III B. The growth rate

of the corresponding o mode now quite weakly depends on the wave number. Both the

modes are found to surpass the n mode in growing long-wavelength perturbations, as shown

in the ﬁgure. In particular, for the parameter region of ˜νei,2

O(1), the growth rate of the

∼

o mode exceeds, even in the short-wavelength region, that of the n mode, that is, along the

27

6
mechanism elucidated in Sec. III B, the electron-ion collision aﬀects the slow return current,

even if the forward beam current is in the collisionless regime. This consequence is consistent

with the previous results obtained by carrying out the fully relativistic and electromagnetic

particle simulation for asymmetrically counterstreaming electron currents in plasma [37].

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In conclusion, I have systematically investigated the details of collisional and thermal

eﬀects on the relativistic current ﬁlamentation instability, generalizing dispersion relation

of the beam-Maxwell system. For speciﬁc cases, the approximate dispersions have been

derived and applied to the instability analysis of typical counterstreaming relativistic

electron currents, relevant to ignitor physics. For the symmetrically counterstreaming cases,

the particular results are summarized as follows:

(i) Eﬀects of electron-electron collision suppress the relativistic Weibel instability for all

wavelengths. The eﬀects newly create a growing wave mode, but its growth rate is always

lower than that of the suppressed Weibel instability.

(ii) Eﬀects of electron-ion collision suppress the relativistic Weibel instability, especially for

short-wavelength perturbations. The eﬀects create growing oscillatory and wave mode. For

long-wavelength perturbations, the growth rates of both modes tend to exceed the growth

rate of the suppressed Weibel instability. For the stronger collisional coupling, and lower

current speed as well, the growth rate of the oscillatory mode can, for all wavelengths, exceed

that of the suppressed Weibel instability.

in a moderate wavelength range.

(iii) Eﬀects of thermal spread simply suppress the relativistic Weibel instability, at least,

For the asymmetrically counterstreaming case, the relativistic Weibel instability for the

symmetrical case is strongly suppressed, though the electron-ion collision still aﬀects the

slow return current, creating the unstable modes, as mentioned above in result (ii).

The important point is that, in general, the growing oscillatory mode is created by de-

phasing a purely oscillatory mode, and the growing wave mode is created by dephasing either

a purely oscillatory wave mode or a purely growing mode. While the collisional eﬀects invoke

28

phase lag, reﬂecting the inverse transformation of Eqs. (14) and (19) for electron-electron and

electron-ion collision, respectively, the thermal eﬀects do not dephase the purely oscillatory,

oscillatory wave, and growing mode, but involve mode dispersion. Hopefully, intense laser-

plasma interaction experiment will be able to reproduce these fundamental consequences,

though they were derived by leaving out longitudinal modes, complexities of mode-coupling,

and so forth.

APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF THE GENERALIZED DISPERSION RELA-

TION INCLUDING COLLISIONAL EFFECTS AND THERMAL CORRECTIONS

In this appendix, I brieﬂy explain the derivation of Eq. (7). By linearizing the

continuity Eq. (2), the density perturbation of electron component a is described as
n1,a = n0,aΩ−1
k = k/ω, and p1,a,i stand for the ﬁrst order quan-
tities of i-directional momentum of the component a. Making use of the relations of

k (p1,a,y/Γ0,a), where Ω−1

p1,a,x = E1,x/(iω

νei), which are obtained by linearizing x component of the vector Eq. (3),

−

the ﬁrst order momenta p1,a,y can be expressed as functions of the ﬁrst order electric ﬁelds

E1,i. Substituting these expressions into the linearized continuity equation mentioned above,

I obtain the ﬁrst order equations for density perturbation in the form of

As it is well known, if the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues ω is much smaller

than the real part, one can calculate them by the Taylor expansion method [51]. However,

this is not the case being considered, as seen in Figs. 1, 3, 6, and 8. That is why, I have

attempted to directly solve the complex Eq. (7) to extract the eigenvalues.

the deﬁnitions of ω0p, ω0n, θ0p, and θ0n are the same as those in Fig. 1 caption. The horizontal

and vertical line correspond to the real and imaginary axis, respectively. The plots of ω can be

compared to the trajectories of arrowhead of the vectors, whose magnitude is scaled by the left

axis. Here, I have chosen the parameter of v0 = 0.9, setting ˜νee = 0 and ˜T0,a = 0. Note that for

FIG. 7: The linear growth rate γ of Eq. (42b) including the eﬀects of electron-ion collision, as

a function of the wave number k, for ˜νei = 0.1 (solid curves), 1 (dot-dashed curves), and 10

respectively. Hair lines for each ˜νei show the linear growth rate γ of Eq. (38) for the o mode. Here,
I have chosen the parameters of v0 = 0.9, setting ˜νee = 0 and ˜T0,a = 0.

FIG. 12: The linear growth rate γ as a function of the wave number k for asymmetrically coun-

terstreaming currents of v0,1 = 0.9 and v0,2 =

0.1 with ˜νei,2 = 0 (crosses) and ˜νei,2 = 1. For

−
the latter case (˜νei,2 = 1), solid, dashed, and dot-dashed curves show γ of the n, o, and p modes,

respectively. Here, I have set ˜νei,1 = 0 for both the cases. For comparison, I also plot γ for a

symmetrical case of v0 = 0.9 without collisions (hair dotted curve), which is the same as the dotted

curve shown in Fig. 11.

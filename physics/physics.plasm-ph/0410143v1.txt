Abstract.
It is shown in an electron-beam-plasma system that phase-space holes
evolve dynamically in electron time scales from appearance to collapse. The holes are
synchronized with a wave packet dominated by a beam mode, and their velocity radii
depend on the packet crest amplitudes. This suggests that the holes are induced by a
self-trapping phenomenon. It seems from the observed images that the trapped-beam
is hard to be detrapped while the packet grows linearly, but easy to be done after that.

1. Introduction

2

In a cold electron-beam-plasma system, it is well-known that a wave packet develops
linearly in the ﬁrst regime, obeying electron-beam mode properties described by a linear
equation [1]. But the packet can not continue to grow inﬁnitely, so that saturation
and damping occur in the next regime. For the reason, it is thought that such a wave
packet is easy to be accompanied with nonlinear phenomena [2, 3], such as modulational
instability [4], electron-beam trapping [5, 6] and so on. Yamagiwa et al [7] experimentally
observed that a wave packet in saturation process evolves into a wave packet train as
continuously emitting some wave packets. They argued with the nonlinear theory of
Yajima et al [8], but could not make the evolution mechanisms clear. Meanwhile, from
viewpoints of computer simulation results [9, 10], it has been interesting that electron-
beam holes are present in phase-space as resulting from particle trapping due to a wave
packet. In previous work [11], we attributed an abnormal spread below a phase velocity
to electron-beam trapping as approach to the above mechanisms, though we could not
observe any holes.

Since the holes evolve in electron time scales as well as the packet, it had been very
hard for those evolutions to be explored in laboratory experiments. We use an energy
analyzer [12], and separate the analyzer signal into low and high frequency bands, and
can capture phase-space holes consisting of beam-electrons in a cold plasma. In this
paper, we clarify the dynamical evolutions of the holes, and discuss their behaviors
correlated with the packet.

2. Experimental System

A cylinder chamber made of stainless steel, whose sizes are 0.26 m in diameter and 1.2
m in length, is ﬁlled with argon gas of low pressure 2.8 × 10−5 Torr. A cold plasma is
produced by DC-discharging in the gas between four heated ﬁlaments and the chamber
wall. Then the plasma is conﬁned by full-line cusps [13] produced by twelve line-magnets
mounted on the external surface of the chamber. An electron-beam gun at z = 0 is
mounted on an end ﬂange of the chamber, and can emit a pulsed cold electron-beam
with the diameter 50 mm, the duration time 3.5 µs, and the mean energy of φb = 50 eV.
The beam injected into the plasma behaves one-dimensionally along axial DC-magnetic
ﬁeld 0.01 T induced by six external coils. A wave packet excited in this system is
observed as potential perturbations by using a coaxial probe, whose tip is 0.3 mm in
diameter and 2.0 mm in length. An energy analyzer [12], which has the aperture of
diameter 5.5 mm, is adopted so as to observe a phase-space distribution of the beam.
A collector in the analyzer is shielded against electric ﬁelds and can detect the beam
currents discriminated by a biased grid facing the plasma. These probes are illustrated
in Fig 1.

These observations are synchronized with a test wave signal, which consists of the
carrier frequency 90 MHz and the envelop time width 50 ns by the full width at half

maximum (FWHM). The test wave signal is applied to a control grid of the gun at
t = 0 in order to excite a wave packet, and simultaneously triggers two digitizing
oscilloscopes with 1 × 109 samples per second. The packet signal detected by the
coaxial probe is ampliﬁed by a high frequency ampliﬁer (0.1-1300 MHz). The beam
current signal detected by the analyzer is divided into two, and they are in parallel
ampliﬁed by a low frequency (LF) ampliﬁer of DC-8 MHz band and a high frequency
(HF) ampliﬁer of 8-1300 MHz band. These ampliﬁed signals are individually received
with time-averaging on two channels of the oscilloscopes, and those data are stored
in PC. Ends of coaxial cables are all connected to matching resistances 50 Ω. These
detections are carried out at each of 128 axial positions from k0z = 22 to 75 (k0 deﬁned
below). The LF and HF signals of the beam current are synthesized on PC in each
cell of the discriminating energy and the position. Eventually, the ﬁrst derivatives of
the synthesized beam current with respect to the discriminating energy at the positions
give the phase-space distribution of the beam. Table 1 lists typical parameters of the
experiment. Here k0 = ωpe/vb is deﬁned for convenience.

Figure 2 shows a wave packet (upper lefts) and a phase-space distribution fb of the beam
(lower lefts) in time intervals of 3.4/ωpe. Here dark contrast corresponds to the beam

v, z, and t are the velocity, the position, and the time, respectively. The packet exhibits
the temporal evolution from linear growth (ωpet < 103) to saturation (ωpet & 103)
processes. Four electron-beam holes emerge discretely as corresponding to positions
of the packet crest. Since the holes evolve temporally, we assign a number for each
from the downstream side so as to identify them easily. Note that random spontaneous
waves excited by the beam, which are invisible in the averaging observation due to no
synchronization with the test wave, scatter the beam especially in the downstream side,
but the scattered beam can be treated as almost steady-state in this observation.

The typical proﬁle of the packet is as follows: phase velocity is vφ ≃ 0.92vb, wave
number k ≃ 1.05k0, frequency ωr ≃ 0.97ωpe, temporal growth rate ωi ≃ 0.062ωpe, and
group velocity in the linear growth process about 0.90vb. The proﬁle suggests that the
packet in the linear growth process obeys an electron-beam mode in the two-stream
instability [1].

Initially, as the packet is propagated downward, its amplitude grows linearly and
the holes generate around v = vφ. For instance, the second and third hole, which emerge
around ωpet = 83, 93, respectively, are gradually shaping ﬁne circles with the packet
growth, and as seen in the cross-section views at ωpet = 96, 103, their velocity radii
become large with the packet amplitudes. The holes are in phase with the packet crests,
and the radii are strongly correlated with the crest amplitudes. These results obviously
prove that the beam is trapped in the potential wells of the packet, and the trapping
starts from the initial stage of the growth process. The holes can be theoretically
regarded as right-handed vortices [2], though their rotations are invisible. It is seen that
the beam bunching (arrows), which is clear in the cross-section views at ωpet = 100, 106,
arises between the adjacent holes. The bunching formation indicates that parts of the
trapped beam are localized where electric ﬁelds are almost zero. When the packet shifts
to the saturation process, the hole shapes gradually become unclear in the downstream
side and appear to collapse, leaving their traces in the lower velocity side. Since the
packet saturation is attributed to energy supply from the packet to the beam, it is likely
to be detrapped partly in the downstream side and thus the hole collapsing seems to

An electron trapped in a wave potential well bounces with the frequency of ωt =
(ek2φ/m)1/2 and rotates in phase-space with the velocity radius of ∆v = 2ωt/k [2, 10],
which mean that ∆v2 is dependently proportional to φ. Here φ is the amplitude of
the wave potential, e the electron charge, and m the electron mass. Figure 3 shows
the dependences of the hole velocity radii ∆v/vb on the packet crest amplitudes in the
growth (dots) process and the saturation (circles) process, obtained from Fig. 2. Axial
ranges of φ/φb and ωt/ωpe are calculated from ∆v/vb = 0.023 to 0.23. A solid line is
∆v2 ∝ φ. A broken line corresponds to ωi/ωpe in the growth process. We estimate
that the maximum potential amplitude is about 6.0 × 10−3φb, and then ωt is about
5.8 × 10−2ωpe. Plots almost agrees with the solid line, which supports that the hole
formation in Fig. 2 is due to the trapping eﬀect.

On the other hand, electron detrapping is also regarded in that trapped electrons
take away a part of wave energy. In the growth process, all plots of ωt are less than
ωi as seen in Fig. 3, in other words, the bounce times are longer than the growth one.
Therefore this indicates that it is diﬃcult for the beam to be detrapped. However the
beam can be partly detrapped in the saturation process because ωi eventually comes to
be much less than all ωt. This result is consistent with that of Fig. 2. The trapping
suppresses the packet growth, but its eﬀect seems so weak that the packet shape can not
be deformed [11]. Unfortunately, the packet train [7] is not observed in this experiment,
but we assume that if the beam is strongly accelerated in the detrapping process, the
second packet will be excited and then it be formed.

4. Conclusion

It is experimentally observed in an electron-beam-plasma system that phase-space holes
consisting of beam-electrons emerge and develop dynamically. The holes are alive while a
wave packet grows linearly, obeying an electron-beam mode in the two-stream instability.
The development of the holes is correlated with that of a wave packet, and then the
square velocity radii of the holes are almost proportional to the amplitudes of the packet
crests. These prove that the holes are induced by a self-trapping eﬀect. The packet
growth is gradually suppressed by the trapping inﬂuence, so that the packet amplitude
saturates eventually. The magnitude of the bounce frequencies, estimated by the velocity
radii, implies that the beam is diﬃcult to be detrapped in the growth process, but it is
easy to be partly done in the saturation process. The holes appear to ﬁnish their lives
as collapsing by the beam detrapping.

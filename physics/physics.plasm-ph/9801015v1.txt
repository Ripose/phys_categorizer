Abstract

A thin and dense plasma layer is created when an intense laser pulse impinges

on a solid target. The nonlinearity introduced by the time-dependent electron

density leads to the generation of harmonics. The pulse duration of the har-

monic radiation is related to the risetime of the electron density and thus can

be aﬀected by the shape of the incident pulse and its peak ﬁeld strength. Re-

sults are presented from numerical particle-in-cell-simulations of an intense

laser pulse interacting with a thin foil target. An analytical model which

shows how the harmonics are created is introduced. The proposed scheme

might be a promising way towards the generation of attosecond pulses.

In recent years several mechanisms generating harmonics of electromagnetic radiation

have been discovered. Among these high-order harmonics from gases [1] and harmonics

production from the plasma-vacuum boundary when a laser pulse impinges on a solid target

[2] are the most prominent ones. Especially the high-order gas-harmonics, exhibiting a

“plateau” instead of a rapid decrease with the harmonic order, seem to be a promising

source for xuv “water-window”-radiation. Apart from the eﬀort to make progress towards

shorter wavelengths, another goal is to achieve shorter pulse durations because the temporal

resolution in pump-probe experiments clearly depends on the pulse length. One scheme

proposed to generate attosecond pulses is based on phase-matching pulse trains which are

produced by a laser pulse focused into a jet of rare gases [3]. Another method makes use of

the fact that the eﬃciency of gas-harmonics generation is sensitive to the ellipticity of the

incident laser light [4].

The method to generate an ultra-short low order harmonic laser pulse as proposed in this

Letter is based on a completely diﬀerent mechanism. We would like to stress in advance that

the method is not appropriate for generating particularly high order harmonics eﬃciently.

We assume a linearly polarized laser pulse impinging perpendicularly on a thin foil tar-

get. In the following analytical and numerical calculations the whole setup is treated one

dimensionally in space, i.e., the laser pulse propagates along x and the electric ﬁeld is in y-

direction. The foil will be ionized by the pulse. To calculate the pulse propagation through a

medium with varying free electron density one has to solve the inhomogeneous wave equation

∂x2 E(x, t) −

j(x, t).

The Green’s function of this equation is G(x, x′, t, t′) = −cΘ[c(t − t′) − |x − x′|]/2 where

Θ(y) is the step-function, i.e., Θ(y) = 1 for y > 0 and 0 otherwise. The solution of (1) can

be written as the sum of the incident ﬁeld E0(x, t) and the radiation ﬁeld produced by the

current j(x, t), i.e., E(x, t) = E0(x, t) + Er(x, t), with

In order to model thin foils we now assume a delta-like current in space [5]. If the thin

foil is located at x = 0 the current is j(x, t) = [−ene(x, t)ve(x, t) + Zeni(x, t)vi(x, t)]ℓδ(x),

with ne,i and ve,i the electron and ion density, and velocity, respectively, and Z the ion’s

charge state. Integrating j(x, t) over x one ﬁnds that the current per unit area equals that

of a “real” physical thin foil of thickness ℓ (as long as there is no strong electron density

gradient across the foil). Inserting the current j(x, t) into (2) and performing the spatial

integration lead to

Er(x, t) = −

dt′ Θ[c(t − t′) − |x|]

∂

∂t′ jh(0, t′)

where jh(x, t) = −ene(x, t)ve(x, t) + Zeni(x, t)vi(x, t). If we assume that the pulse hits the

target at t = 0 we ﬁnally get

E(x, t) = E0(x, t) −

for the electric ﬁeld (tret = t − |x|/c is the retarded time). The current jh(0, tret) itself

where n = ne.

Here it has been assumed that all newly created electrons are born with the appropriate

ﬂuid element velocity and that collisional as well as relativistic eﬀects are negligible. Besides,

we neglect in our analytical treatment energy subtraction from the pulse due to the ﬁnite

ionization energy of the target material. How this energy loss as well as momentum transfer

due to the velocity distribution of the ionization produced electrons can be incorporated in

a ﬂuid description is studied in [6]. All pulse intensities considered in this Letter do not

cause relativistic electron motion.

Supposing an ionization rate Γ applicable for pulse intensities under considera-

tion has been chosen,

ωp is the plasma frequency of the fully ionized target, ω2

p = e2n0/ε0m, and ω1 and λ1 are

the incident EM wave’s frequency and length, respectively. The dimensionless parameter

ξ/ω1 determines how strong the propagation of the incident pulse is aﬀected by the foil. For

ξ/ω1 ≪ 1 the foil is optically “thin”.

If the foil is not pre-ionized or ionization is not completed already during the very early

part of the pulse, (6) remains nonlinear due to the electron-density shape-factor which

depends on the electric ﬁeld through the rate Γ[E]. Therefore one expects harmonics in the

transmitted and reﬂected light.

In what follows we will restrict ourselves to study (6) in ﬁrst order in ξ/ω1 (i.e., we

assume a “thin” foil and iterate (6) once). At the position of the foil then

holds. Here, the diﬃculty is to calculate exp(−

0 dt′ Γ[E0(0, t′)]). The ionization rate Γ

depends on the absolute value of the electric ﬁeld, i.e., the rate has two maxima per fun-

R

damental laser cycle. Supposed that the pulse envelope ˆE0 is suﬃciently adiabatic the rate

may be expanded in a Fourier-series with even multiples of the fundamental frequency only,

and a slowly time-dependent envelope ˆΓ,

Since the rate Γ is a complicated functional of the ﬁeld, in general all terms in the ex-

pansion (9) are present. However, if we assume the incident pulse (divided by its amplitude)

to be an even function in time, E0(t) ∼ cos ω1t, all coeﬃcients b2n in (9) vanish. This ﬁnally

leads to

Here, α0 = ˆΓa0/2, αn = ˆΓa2n/2nω1, and Im is the modiﬁed Bessel-function. Note that

α0, αn are slowly time-dependent due to their dependence on ˆΓ.

From (10) we can deduce that by ionization in ﬁrst order of ξ/ω1 only odd harmonics

will be produced: In (10) the term in curly brackets is composed of even harmonics, but

multiplied with sin ω1t odd harmonics are created.

Harmonics production is enhanced when ξ/ω1 is increased. Therefore increasing the

density or the thickness of the foil acts in favor of the creation of harmonics. However,

one has to bear in mind that a perturbative treatment with respect to ξ/ω1 preceded here.

Furthermore, increasing density n0 or thickness ℓ simply makes the foil less transparent.

In order to get rid of the product of sums of Bessel-functions in (10) we now assume

that the n = 1-contribution in the Fourier-decomposition of the rate strongly dominates,

i.e., α2, α3, . . . ≈ 0. Eq. (10) then simpliﬁes to

E(t) = ˆE0 cos ω1t

The argument of the Bessel functions, α1 = ˆΓa2/2ω1 is basically the ratio of ionization

rate to fundamental frequency. Supposing that α1 ≪ 1 which is the case if ionization

lasts for several laser cycles, we can use the asymptotic expression In(z) ≈ [(z/2)n]/n! for

the modiﬁed Bessel-function. In this approximation the relative peak height of subsequent

harmonic orders is proportional to α2

1, i.e., increasing the ﬁeld strength (which leads to an

increased ionization rate) should result in less rapidly dropping harmonics in the spectrum.

However, the eﬃciency of harmonics generation decreases with increasing ﬁeld strength

simply due to the fact that the nonlinearity in Eq. (10) switches oﬀ as soon as the foil

5

is fully ionized. Therefore there seems to be no way to achieve very high harmonics by

ionization eﬀects.

A 1D particle-in-cell (PIC) code was used to simulate laser pulse-thin foil interaction. In

order to incorporate ionization the rate equations governing the ionization state of the target

were solved during each “PIC-cycle” [7]. For simplicity only one ionization state with the

ionization energy of hydrogen (13.6 eV) was assumed. Landau’s tunneling-rate [8] was used

which is a reasonable choice for the ﬁeld strengths and frequencies under consideration. The

short risetime of the electron density forces a tiny time step. Usually one fundamental laser

cycle (wavelength) was sampled by 1000 temporal (spatial) gridpoints. About 104 computer

particles, sampling the physical charge densities of the thin foil were found to be suﬃcient.

The ions were mobile (although this is unimportant for the eﬀect under consideration) and

1836 times heavier than the electrons (hydrogen).

In Fig. 1 numerically computed spectra of the transmitted light are shown for 5 diﬀerent

peak ﬁeld strengths ˆE0, corresponding to intensities I = 4.0, 4.8, 6.5 × 1014 and 1.1, 1.6 ×

1015 W/cm2. All other parameters were held constant: wavelength λ1 = 815 nm, foil

thickness ℓ = λ1/10, incident sin2-shaped laser pulse of duration T = 30 fs, and the density

was the critical one with respect to the fundamental frequency, i.e., n0 = nc = 1.68 ×

1021 cm−3.

The higher the ﬁeld strength, the broader are the harmonics peaks in the spectrum.

The pulse length of the harmonics radiation is closely related to the risetime of the electron

density in the foil since as soon as the density remains constant harmonics production will

stop. In Fig. 2 the normalized electron density is plotted vs. time for the 5 ﬁeld strengths of

Fig. 1. A risetime covering 3 fundamental periods for the weakest pulse and only one cycle

for the strongest pulse can be infered from the plot (each stair in the density corresponds

to one half cycle). The density risetime is very sensitive to ﬁeld strength and pulse shape.

Increasing the ﬁeld strength leads to a decreasing density risetime and hence to a shorter

harmonics pulse length. However, we already mentioned above that the conversion eﬃciency

decreases when the ﬁeld strength of the incident pulse is increased since the nonlinearity

6

switches oﬀ too soon. Furthermore the “harmonics” peaks are shifted and asymmetrically

broadened if complete ionization occurs within only one fundamental cycle (or even less). In

the limit of a step-like behavior of the electron density the spectrum resembles the Fourier-

transform of the Θ-function with no ω1-harmonics structure at all.

In Fig. 1 the pulse length of the harmonic radiation can be estimated by ﬁtting the

peaks in the spectrum to a Fourier transformed “test envelope” ∼ sin2 πt/Tn. Tn is the

pulse duration of the nth harmonic. For the 5 cases of Fig. 1 one ﬁnds for the pulse length

of the 3rd harmonic T3 = 3.3, 3.0, 2.3, 2.0, 1.9 times the fundamental period τ = 2π/ω1. A

lower limit for T3 certainly is τ itself because a shorter risetime of the electron density leads

to a vanishing ω1-structure in the spectrum. The power in the 3rd harmonic is about 10−6

of the fundamental.

One may object that the incident pulse intensity was already small (at least for “up-

to-date” short pulse laser systems) so that the 3rd-harmonic pulse with only a millionth

of its intensity is not very useful. However, the incident pulse might be a stronger but

defocused pulse so that the 3rd harmonic output, when focused, becomes considerable.

Besides, using a shorter fundamental wavelength (and correspondingly a thinner and/or

denser foil) would require a higher ﬁeld strength to fully ionize the target within the same

number of cycles. By examining the dimensionless parameters ξ/ω1 and ˆΓ/ω1 one can

estimate the “experimental parameters” ℓ, n0 and ˆE in order to meet the desired harmonic

pulse duration T3. The practical limit for T3 found in the numerical simulations is about 2τ .

If the incident light has already a rather short wavelength (e.g., if light, produced by one of

the high-harmonics mechanisms described above are used) then the 2τ -limit can be shifted

towards the attosecond-domain. However, in that case it would be certainly a challenging

task to ﬁnd the optimal parameters ℓ and n0 for a manufacturable thin foil.

One may argue that during the plasma formation process in the thin foil electron-

ion-collisions might be important, especially for the relatively low ﬁeld strengths about

≈ 1015 W/cm2. Since it is during the plasma formation where the harmonics are produced

there might be serious distortions in the spectrum of the transmitted light.

In order to

7

take electron-ion-collisions into account we introduced a collision frequency νei into our 1D

PIC-code. This leads to dissipation of energy due to friction of the oscillating charge-sheets

(note that in a 1D PIC-code each “computer-particle” represents an actual charge sheet [7]).

The dissipated energy is used to determine a “sheet-temperature” which, in turn, enters into

νei. We found collisions causing mainly distortions at high frequencies but the 3rd and 5th

harmonic-peaks were almost unaltered. For stronger incident pulses the eﬀect of collisions

is even less.

With our PIC-code we also examined the eﬀects of energy subtraction due to the ion-

ization energy of the target material (according to the model in [6]). The most prominent

eﬀect, as far as harmonics generation is concerned, is that ionization gets slowed down

slightly (which can be compensated by choosing a higher incident pulse intensity).

It is worth mentioning that the observed eﬀect of harmonics production due to the rise of

the electron density in the foil may be used to measure the ionization time of the foil instead

of presupposing an ionization rate. This oﬀers an opportunity for checking the validity of

ionization models experimentally.

In summary, we have studied the spectrum of a perpendicularly incident laser pulse when

transmitted through a rapidly ionizing thin foil, numerically as well as analytically. Low

order odd harmonics were observed. The pulse duration of the harmonic radiation is only

a few cycles with respect to the frequency of the incident laser light. The pulse length is

governed by the risetime of the electron density in the foil and therefore it can be easily

tuned through adjusting the peak ﬁeld strength of the incident pulse. This might be a

promising way towards the generation of attosecond pulses.

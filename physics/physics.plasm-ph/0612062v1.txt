The fully nonlinear governing equations for spin 1

2 quantum plasmas are presented. Starting from
the Pauli equation, the relevant plasma equations are derived, and it is shown that nontrivial quan-
tum spin couplings arise, enabling studies of the combined collective and spin dynamics. The linear
response of the quantum plasma in an electron–ion system is obtained and analyzed. Applications
of the theory to solid state and astrophysical systems as well as dusty plasmas are pointed out.

There is currently a great deal of interest in investi-
gating collective plasma modes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] in
quantum plasmas, as such plasmas could be of relevance
in nano-scale electro-mechanical systems [9, 10, 11], in
microplasmas and dense laser-plasmas [12], and laser in-
teractions with atomic systems [13, 14]. For example,
Refs. [1] and [3, 4, 5] used quantum transport models
in order to derive modiﬁed dispersion relations for Lang-
muir and ion-acoustic waves, while Shukla & Stenﬂo [15]
ionvestigated drift modes in nonuniform quantum mag-
netoplasmas. Moreover, it is known that cold quantum
plasmas can support new dust modes [16, 17]. In Ref.
[8] it was shown that electron quantum plasmas could
support highly stable dark solitons and vortices. Fur-
ther examples of quantum plasmas and the range of va-
lidity of their descriptions has been discussed recently
in Ref. [18]. The above studies of quantum plasmas
have used models based on the Schr¨odinger description

important eﬀects could appear as further quantum ef-
fects are incorporated in models describing the quantum
plasma particles. The coupling of spin to classical mo-
tion has attracted interest in the literature (see, e.g.,
[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]). Much
work has been done concerning single particle spin eﬀects
in external ﬁeld conﬁgurations, such as intense laser ﬁelds
[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], and the possible experimental sig-
natures thereof. However, there have also been interest
in excitations of collective modes in spin systems, such as
spin waves, in a wide scientiﬁc community. For example,
in Refs. [19, 20, 21] hydrodynamical models including
spin was presented, and further theory concerning spin,
angular momentum, and the forces related to spin was
discussed in Refs. [29] and [30]. Moreover, spin waves
in spinor Bose condensates has recently been discussed
in, e.g., Ref. [31]. The treatment of charged particles
and plasmas using quantum theory has received atten-
tion in astrophysical settings, especially in strongly mag-

netized environments [32, 33]. For example, eﬀects of
quantum ﬁeld theory on the linear response of an elec-
tron gas has been analyzed [34], results concerning the
spin-dependence of cyclotron decay on strong magnetic
ﬁelds has been presented [35], and the propagation of
quantum electrodynamical waves in strongly magnetized
plasmas has been considered [36].

In this Letter we present for the ﬁrst time the fully non-
linear governing equations for spin 1
2 quantum electron
plasmas. Starting from the Pauli equation describing
the nonrelativistic electron, we show that the electron–
ion plasma equations are subject to spin related terms.
These terms give rise to a multitude of collective eﬀects
of which some are investigated in detail. Applications of
the governing equations are discussed, and it is shown
that under certain circumstances the collective spin ef-
fects can dominate the plasma dynamics.

We will assume that the electron wave function can
be written in the product form Ψ = Ψ(1)Ψ(2) . . . Ψ(N ),
where N is the number of particle states. Thus we will
here neglect the eﬀects of entanglement and focus on the
collective properties of the the quantum electron plasma.
Then the non-relativistic evolution of spin 1
2 particles, as
described by the two-component spinor Ψ(α), is given by

By introducing the decomposition of the spinors ac-

in classical ﬂuid theory) it is necessary to impose fur-
ther statistical relations in order to close the system [38].
The preceding analysis applies equally well to electrons
as holes or similar condensations. We will now include
the ion species, which, due to the smaller charge-to-mass
ratio, are described by the classical equations of motion.
The coupling between the quantum plasma species is
mediated by the electromagnetic ﬁeld. By deﬁnition we

current jsp =
(2nµBS/¯h) [39]. We obtain consistency
with the momentum conservation equation (4) by adding
a term proportional to V ×Bsp to the Lorentz force, and
subtracting it from the quantum force. The above alter-
ations are only reshuﬄing of terms. However, a diﬀerence
do appear when closing the system using Faraday’s law.

we indeed obtain a diﬀerence compared to the classical
Maxwell’s equations. It is the full electromagnetic ﬁelds,
including spin sources, that should be used in Faraday’s
law. Thus, Faraday’s law as presented here is therefore
the correct one to use. This form also gives a Hermitian
susceptibility tensor (see below), something which is not
obtained otherwise.

To demonstrate the usefulness of the spin ﬂuid equa-
tions, we investigate linear wave propagation in a mag-
netized plasma. For comparison we ﬁrst neglect all
quantum eﬀects. Linearizing and Fourier analyzing the
equations of motion, and substituting the velocities into
Maxwells equations, we obtain ε

low-frequency wave motion in a highly magnetized (or

plasma eﬀects can be important even in a high tempera-
ture plasma.The spin eﬀect on the fast and slow mode is
illustrated in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we point out that for
modes with even lower phase velocities (which exist in for
example dusty plasmas [16]), the relative importance of
the spin susceptibility term is enhanced, and spin eﬀects
can be signiﬁcant also under laboratory conditions.

In conclusion, we have derived the multi-ﬂuid equa-
tions for spin 1
2 quantum plasmas, starting from the
Pauli equation. In order to demonstrate the usefulness
of our equations, we have analyzed the linear modes,
and demonstrated that the low-frequency modes are sig-
niﬁcantly altered by the spin eﬀects provided the con-

eﬀects can be neglected due to the random orienta-
tions of the spin vector. We stress here, however, that
our results show that the spin multi-ﬂuid equations can
have important applications to such diﬀerent mediums
as low-temperature solid state plasmas, as well as to
the accretion discs surrounding pulsars and magnetars.
Furthermore, we emphasize that the spin-contributions
are typically more important than the usual quantum
plasma corrections [18], speciﬁcally when the inequality

The linearized results presented in this Letter will most
likely ﬁnd its experimental application in dusty plasmas,
where the low phase velocity will make the relative im-
portance of the spin contribution (13) particularly signif-
icant, enabling probing of the collective spin dynamics.
Finally, we suggest that the full nonlinear system (3)–
(7) will show interesting behavior close to the electrons
cyclotron frequency, when the spin vector evolution be-
comes resonant. Moreover, the importance of the pres-
sure like spin terms for, e.g., astrophysical plasmas is a

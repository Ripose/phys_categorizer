Abstract

It was recently demonstrated that static, resistive, magnetohydrodynamic

equilibria, in the presence of spatially-uniform electrical conductivity, do not

exist in a torus under a standard set of assumed symmetries and boundary

conditions. The diﬃculty, which goes away in the “periodic straight cylinder

approximation,” is associated with the necessarily non-vanishing character of

the curl of the Lorentz force, j×B. Here, we ask if there exists a spatial proﬁle

of electrical conductivity that permits the existence of zero-ﬂow, axisymmetric

resistive equilibria in a torus, and answer the question in the aﬃrmative.

However, the physical properties of the conductivity proﬁle are unusual (the

conductivity cannot be constant on a magnetic surface, for example) and

whether such equilibria are to be considered physically possible remains an

open question.

I. INTRODUCTION

Discussions of the magnetic conﬁnement of plasmas and their stability usually begin

with the subject of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria.1,2 In the present generation of

devices, dominated by the tokamak concept, the magnetoﬂuids usually carry currents and

contain strong dc magnetic ﬁelds whose sources are in external coils.

Since the earliest days of fusion research, the various MHD equilibria have been treated

as ideal. They are assumed to have inﬁnite electrical conductivity and no ﬂow, so that

Ohm’s law,

E + v×B = j/σ,

(1)

is satisﬁed by taking all three terms equal to zero. Here, E is the electric ﬁeld, v is the ﬂuid

velocity, j is the electrical current density, and σ is the electrical conductivity, allowed to

become inﬁnite. In familiar “Alfvenic” dimensionless units, the curl of the magnetic ﬁeld

B is just j, and of course, the divergences of B and j are zero.

In the limit of inﬁnite

conductivity, the sharp connection that must exist between E and j for large but ﬁnite

conductivity is, of course, destroyed. There have been attempts to reintroduce the eﬀects of

ﬁnite conductivity (e.g., see Grad and Hogan3), but these attempts are in our opinion not a

satisfactory resolution; too many possibilities are raised to be able to deal with any one of

them conclusively.

With the inﬁnite conductivity assumption, the only remaining MHD requirement for

equilibrium is one of mechanical force balance, with the local Lorentz force j×B taken

equal to

p, the mechanical pressure gradient. Such ideal equilibria are plentiful1,2 and are

∇

not constrained by the Ohm’s law. The Grad-Shafranov formulation1,2,4,5 then provides a

framework in which axisymmetric, toroidal ideal equilibria can be calculated.

Investigating the stability of such ideal equilibria can be a lengthy undertaking. This is

particularly true when the program includes investigating the various “resistive instabilities”

that the ideal equilibria may be thought heir to. Aside from the questions of consistency

2

raised by ignoring resistive terms when constructing the equilibria, but then including them

in the linear stability analysis, the possibilities for uncovering new variants of non-ideal,

normal modes growing about ideal steady states can seem almost limitless.

The purpose of this paper is to re-open the subject of zero-ﬂow MHD steady states by

considering the implications of retaining Eq. (1) with ﬁnite σ. Attention will be conﬁned

to axisymmetric steady states with zero ﬂow (v = 0) in the simplest toroidal geometry.

A previous note by Montgomery and Shan6 reported a proof of a somewhat unanticipated

result: no such equilibria exist for the case of spatially uniform σ. Here, we inquire into

what kinds of spatial dependences of the conductivity σ will permit axisymmetric, toroidal

steady states without ﬂow. We do not answer the question of how such conductivity proﬁles

might occur, or indeed whether they are to be expected on physical grounds.

The hydrodynamic precedent suggests the need for such inquiries, as illustrated by plane

shear ﬂows such as pipe ﬂow, plane Poiseuille ﬂow, or ﬂow around obstacles (e.g., see

Acheson7).

In the case of pipe ﬂow, for example, a uniform pressure gradient balances

the axial viscous body force in the steady state. In the “ideal” limit, both may be allowed

to go to zero proportionately, but the connection between them must not be lost, or what was

a well-determined (parabolic) velocity proﬁle may become anything at all; any axial velocity

dependence upon radius is an acceptable steady state, clearly a nonsensical conclusion. Yet

the stability of each one of these possible proﬁles could be investigated ad inﬁnitum.

It is perhaps worth remarking that in the absence of ﬂow velocity, the situation de-

scribed here is one of classical resistive magnetostatics, and may be treated by standard

methods borrowed from electricity and magnetism textbooks. One can say that until a

magnetoﬂuid begins to ﬂow, it does not know whether it is a solid piece of metal with a

particular spatially-dependent electrical conductivity or a plasma. Once the requirement of

balancing the Lorentz force against a scalar pressure gradient is met, none of the additional

approximations or assumptions of magnetohydrodynamics per se need to be used for this

problem.

We also mention that recently, Bates and Lewis8 have developed mathematical machinery

3

for treating toroidal equilibrium proﬁles in true toroidal coordinates. They were able to

substantiate the result of Montgomery and Shan6 in considerably more detail.

It is important that the point of view adopted here be stated clearly. We believe the

full set of time-independent MHD equations, including resistivity, velocity ﬁelds, tensor

transport coeﬃcients, and realistic boundary conditions, are far too diﬃcult to solve at

this moment. This is the reason that nearly all MHD equilibrium theory has been ideal,

and has omitted these eﬀects, even when it has been asserted that ”resistive instabilities”

were being calculated. We are interested in moving as far as we can to remove the above

restrictions, but we are also interested in doing so only by exhibiting explicit solutions to

whatever problem is undertaken. We are fully aware of the desirability of including all of

the complications. Here, only one is included: ﬁnite resistivity. It is a new result that there

exist ﬁnite-resistivity toroidal MHD equilibria without ﬂow, which, in many ways, do not

look vastly diﬀerent from ideal equilibria. How these states that are exhibited here relate to

more general toroidal solutions with ﬂow and the other possible complications is a separate,

and much harder, question.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we ask and answer the question of what

kinds of spatial proﬁles of scalar conductivity will permit axisymmetric toroidal equilibria in

the presence of a stationary, toroidal inductive electric ﬁeld. A partial diﬀerential equation

is developed which can be thought of as replacing the Grad-Shafranov equation. In Sec. III,

particular cases are worked out in detail. Implications are discussed in Sec. IV, along with

questions about possible developments and extensions of the theory.

II. THE FINITE-CONDUCTIVITY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION

In toroidal geometry (in contrast to the “straight cylinder” approximation9,10,11,12), the

steady-state Maxwell equation,

×E = 0, has non-trivial implications for the zero-ﬂow

∇

Ohm’s law. We use cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, z) whose associated unit basis vectors are

(ˆer, ˆeϕ, ˆez). The z axis is the axis of symmetry of the torus, and z = 0 is the midplane. Ax-

4

isymmetry implies that the components of each vector ﬁeld are independent of the azimuthal

coordinate ϕ. The center line of the torus will be taken to be the circle r = r0, z = 0. The

toroidal cross section will be speciﬁed by giving some bounding curve in the r, z plane that

encloses this center line. We will choose a speciﬁc shape when illustrating the results of the

formalism. The wall of the container will be idealized as a rigid conductor coated with a

thin layer of insulating dielectric. We do not consider the slits and slots that are necessary

in any conducting boundary to permit the driving (toroidal) electric ﬁeld to penetrate and

drive the toroidal current.

The electric ﬁeld E = Eϕˆeϕ will be assumed to result from a time-proportional magnetic

ﬂux (z direction) which is conﬁned to an axisymmetric iron core whose axis coincides with the

z-axis and which lies entirely inside the “hole in the doughnut” of the torus. The iron core is

assumed to be very long, so the inductive electric ﬁeld it produces in response to a magnetic

ﬂux that increases linearly with time is independent of the z-coordinate. Faraday’s law then

implies that Eϕ(r) = E0r0/r only, where E0 is the value of the electric ﬁeld at r = r0. This

is a highly simpliﬁed cartoon of a tokamak geometry, and it is not diﬃcult to think of ways

in which it could be made more realistic. For example, in a more reﬁned model E might

contain the gradient of a function of both r and z that obeys Laplace’s equation. We do

not consider here the possibility of a poloidal current density that could result from a tensor

conductivity.

The fact that E has this form, which is dictated by Maxwell’s equations, has implications

for j = σE: for a scalar conductivity σ, j must also point in the ϕ direction. We shall assume

that σ is a function, as yet unspeciﬁed, of both r and z.

The magnetic ﬁeld consists of a toroidal part (B0r0/r)ˆeϕ, and a poloidal part Bp(r, z)

whose curl must be j:

B =

ˆeϕ + Bp(r, z).

B0r0
r

(2)

B0 is the strength of the toroidal ﬁeld at r = r0; it is supported by external poloidal windings

around the torus. The source for Bp is j, so that

5

The boundary condition on the magnetic ﬁeld is B

ˆn = 0, where ˆn is the unit normal to

the surface of the torus. Thus the magnetic ﬁeld lines will be assumed to be conﬁned to the

torus, and we do not inquire into the necessary external “vertical ﬁeld,” or other current

distribution required to satisfy boundary conditions on B outside the torus.

In addition to solving Eq. (3) subject to the boundary condition, the remaining part of

the problem is guaranteeing the force balance,

p = j×B. This can be done by taking

the divergence of this relation and solving the resulting Poisson equation for p. In order for

·

there to exist such a solution, it is necessary that

× (j×B) =

× (jϕˆeϕ×Bp) = 0.

∇

∇

For uniform σ, it is not possible6 to satisfy Eq. (4). In the present circumstance, the question

is asked: “What proﬁles of σ(r, z) make it possible to satisfy Eq. (4) and then ultimately,

Eq. (3)?” Note that we are not necessarily assuming either incompressibility or uniform

mass density.

If we derive Bp from a vector potential, Bp =

×Aϕ(r, z)ˆeϕ, and compute

×(j×B),

The general solution of Eq. (5) is jϕ/r = f (rAϕ), where f is any diﬀerentiable function

Eq. (6) is structurally similar to the Grad-Shafranov equation; any choice of f will lead

to a partial diﬀerential equation for Aϕ(r, z) which must be solved subject to boundary

conditions. However, a new restriction on the spatial conductivity is implied. Namely, the

toroidal current density rf (rAϕ) must determine σ by

(7)

The right hand side of Eq. (7) must always be positive, but seems otherwise unrestricted.

In terms of the conventional poloidal ﬂux function ψ = rAϕ, the conductivity σ is seen not

to be a “ﬂux function.” That is, it is not constant on a surface of constant ψ, since it is the

square of r times a function of ψ. It is often thought that σ should be constant on surfaces

of constant ψ, since it depends strongly on temperature and ﬂux surfaces are often imagined

to be surfaces of constant temperature.

For a speciﬁc form of the function f , the problem of ﬁnding the solution to Eq. (6) is

straightforward; justifying the spatial dependence of the conductivity implied by Eq. (7),

We pass now to the consideration of some special choices of the function f and their

consequences.

III. TWO EXAMPLES

We do not presently inquire into the physical basis of any possible choice of f (rAϕ), such as,

say, a maximum-entropy or minimum-energy choice. Rather, we select two examples largely

on the basis of algebraic simplicity, and also choose a toroidal cross section for which the

equation becomes separable and the boundary conditions tractable. Even then, both cases

exhibit some complexity.

A. The choice f = constant

The simplest choice is to set f equal to a positive constant λ > 0, making the toroidal

current density jϕ proportional to r and independent of z.

It should be noted that this

r-proportionality (for vorticity) was found useful by Norbury13 in a study of vortex rings.

These were ideal vortex rings, however, and required no external agency to maintain them

7

against dissipation. This makes the conductivity σ vary as the square of r, increasing toward

the “outboard” side of the torus.

Eq. (6), with f = λ, may be solved by ﬁrst noting that it has become a linear, inhomoge-

neous, partial diﬀerential equation, the general solution to which is any particular solution

plus the most general solution of the associated homogeneous equation. A particular solu-

tion is Aϕ =

λr3/8. The remaining homogeneous equation is the equation for a vacuum

−

poloidal axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld. An easy way to ﬁnd this vacuum ﬁeld is to rewrite it

in terms of a magnetic scalar potential Φ that obeys Laplace’s equation:

(8)

Satisfying this boundary condition over a curved surface is a diﬃcult task;6 see, however,

Bates and Lewis.8 For illustrative purposes, we consider a torus with a rectangular cross

section. We assume the toroidal boundaries to lie at z =

L, and at r = r− and r = r+,

±

where r− < r < r+. The vanishing of the normal component of Bϕ at these boundaries

amounts to demanding that

The general solution of

2Φ = 0 for Φ can be written as

(10)

where J0 and Y0 are the usual Bessel and Weber functions, respectively, and C0, Ck, Dk,

and αk are arbitrary constants. The values of k remain to be determined.

Eq. (9a) is satisﬁed by requiring that

can be computed for speciﬁed values of r− and r+, and in this way the discrete spectrum of

the permitted k values determined. For each k, we may calculate Ck/Dk. The results for the

k values, the Ck/Dk ratios, and the ǫk normalization constants can be stored numerically,

and the expansion coeﬃcients ˜Ck determined from Eqs. (16) and (17). We may then plot

magnetic surface contours, or surfaces of constant ψ = rAϕ. The surfaces of constant

pressure (since the current is purely toroidal) are guaranteed to coincide with the ψ-surfaces.

To see that contours of constant pressure coincide with constant ψ-surfaces, it is useful

to express the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld Bp in terms of ψ:

Bp =

∇

(19)

Then, the equation for scalar-pressure equilibrium,

p = j×B, with j = λr ˆeϕ, can be

∇

integrated to give p = λψ + const. In Fig. 1, we illustrate surfaces of constant ψ, for

r−/r0 = 0.6, r+/r0 = 1.4 and L/r0 = 0.3. The current contours, in this case, will be rather

strange, since the current is simply constant on lines of constant r, inside the torus, right

up to the boundary.

B. The case of linear variation

The other case we wish to consider is that of a linear variation of f , or j proportional to the

square of r times Aϕ. The resulting linear diﬀerential equation is now homogeneous, which

results in an interesting, but imperfectly understood “quantum” phenomenon: a preference

for certain ratios of width to height for the rectangular cross section, in the steady states.

It is convenient for this case to re-cast the diﬀerential equation in terms of the magnetic

ﬂux function ψ = rAϕ:

We assume that the magnetoﬂuid ﬁlls a torus with a rectangular cross section bounded by

Eq. (20) into

For each integer n, this equation holds only for a limited combination of λ, r0, δ, and L. That

is, for a particular value of the current density, only certain aspect ratios of the rectangular

toroidal wall are allowed if steady state solutions are to exist.

There is an additional physical constraint to be considered here which limits the values

that the parameters n, λ, r0, δ, and L can assume: the current density jϕ must not change

sign. Consequently, it seems that the only permissible value for n is n = 0. Note that

the homogeneity of Eq. (20) has eliminated the need for an eigenfunction expansion and

satisfaction of boundary conditions, as in Eqs. (16) and (17). We have not experimented

with the possibilities of linear combinations of the two types of f used in this section, but

the range of possibilities is clearly wide.

In the case that f varies linearly with its argument, the pressure is given by p = λ ψ2/2 +

const., which is easily obtained from integrating

p = j×B, with j = λr ψ ˆeϕ and Bp written

∇

in the form of Eq. (19). Thus, once again, the pressure does not vary on surfaces of constant

ψ (magnetic surfaces).

For n = 0, one set of parameters that satisﬁes Eq. (27) is λ r4

0 = 29.375, δ/r0 = 0.4, and

L/r0 = 0.4. Contour plots of ψ, jϕ, and σ using these values appear in Fig. 2. One can

see, from Fig. 2, that no radical qualitative departures from the magnetic surfaces expected

12

from a Grad-Shafranov treatment have been found; the “Shafranov shift” of the magnetic

axis to the outboard side of the torus is clearly evident. The principal diﬀerence is the

non-coincidence of the surfaces of constant conductivity and the magnetic surfaces.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have provided a framework in which toroidal axisymmetric, resistive

steady states can been constructed for the MHD equations with scalar conductivity. Our

approach is to search for a conductivity proﬁle that permits such steady states to exist.

Admittedly, the result is artiﬁcial since no discussion has been given of how such a proﬁle

might arise, or be consistent with an energy equation. If ideal MHD had not dominated

the subject of magnetic conﬁnement theory for forty years, the exercise might be considered

unmotivated. However, since the proof of the nonexistence of toroidal resistive steady states

with uniform conductivity,6,8 the question has arisen whether any current proﬁle will support

a static MHD state; here, we have answered this question aﬃrmatively. We consider the

formalism for constructing static toroidal resistive states, incomplete as it is, to be physically

less objectionable than an ideal treatment, which in fact still underlies the vast majority of

instability calculations.

What actually seems more likely, based on earlier dynamical computations10,12,15 using

the full three-dimensional MHD equations, is that velocity ﬁelds permit Ohm’s law to be

satisﬁed in resistive steady states of conﬁned magnetoﬂuids. Even if this conjecture is

correct, though, the eﬀects of ﬁnite ﬂow will be bound up with that of the conductivity,

which is virtually guaranteed to be spatially non-uniform. The satisfaction of the poloidal

and toroidal components of both Ohm’s law and the equation of motion, simultaneously, is

an arduous task when velocity ﬁelds are included; at present, no one seems close to solving

this problem. The situation becomes even more diﬃcult if one demands that the pressure

be derived from a local equation of state. In this case, complete consistency demands the

simultaneous satisfaction of an energy equation as well – a formidably diﬃcult undertaking

13

(e.g., see Goodman16).

We should remark that the equilibria exhibited here could have been obtained formally

as Grad-Shafranov equilibria with a constant poloidal current function, and with a proper

choice of the pressure function. A demand for consistency with Ohm’s law leads again to a

determination of the conductivity through Eq. (7), with rAφ replaced by ψ, and f replaced

by the derivative of the pressure function with respect to its argument (ψ).

We should remark on a perception of several decades ago, due to Pﬁrsch and Schl¨uter,17

that diﬃculties associated with retaining Ohm’s law and ﬁnite resistivity led to diﬃculties

for ideal MHD equilibrium theory. Their resolution, though never absorbed to any signiﬁcant

degree in working models for tokamak equilibria, was to attempt to satisfy the Ohm’s law in

perturbation theory by using it to calculate iteratively the two perpendicular components of

a ﬂuid velocity to be associated with any given ideal equilibrium. A velocity ﬁeld was thus

taken into account in the Ohm’s law, but not in the equation of motion. A perturbation

expansion in inverse aspect ratio was also featured. The conclusion was reached that a

universal plasma outﬂow existed (sometimes loosely called a “diﬀusion velocity”) that had

to be compensated by “sources” of new plasma within the plasma interior (never identiﬁed

quantitatively). We cannot accept this conclusion. The explicit examples shown here,

which do not rely on any perturbation expansions or other approximations, demonstrate

the existence of zero-ﬂow non-ideal solutions without plasma losses, and as such explicitly

contradict the Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter expressions for positive-deﬁnite outward ﬂux. We do believe,

however, that Pﬁrsch and Schl¨uter were correct in their assumption that real-life toroidal

MHD steady states will involve mass ﬂows in a fundamental way. It is in a sense remarkable

that there has been so little attention to this as yet unresolved problem.

The main point seems to us to be the need for developing a renewed respect for the

problem of determining allowed steady states of a plasma. Neither present diagnostics nor

present theoretical machinery permit it. The phasing out of the vocabulary that has arisen

in connection with ideal steady states will require the passage of some time.

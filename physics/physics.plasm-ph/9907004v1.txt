with helical symmetry and incompressible
ﬂows

Abstract

A recent study on axisymmetric ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibria with
incompressible ﬂows [H. Tasso and G. N. Throumoulopoulos, Phys. Plasmas
5, 2378 (1998)] is extended to the generic case of helically symmetric equi-
libria with incompressible ﬂows. It is shown that the equilibrium states of
the system under consideration are governed by an elliptic partial diﬀerential
equation for the helical magnetic ﬂux function ψ containing ﬁve surface quan-
tities along with a relation for the pressure. The above mentioned equation
can be transformed to one possessing diﬀerential part identical in form to
the corresponding static equilibrium equation, which is amenable to several
classes of analytic solutions. In particular, equilibria with electric ﬁelds per-
pendicular to the magnetic surfaces and non-constant-Mach-number ﬂows are
constructed. Unlike the case in axisymmetric equilibria with isothermal mag-
netic surfaces, helically symmetric T = T (ψ) equilibria are over-determined,
i.e., in this case the equilibrium equations reduce to a set of eight ordinary
diﬀerential equations with seven surface quantities. In addition, it is proved
the non-existence of incompressible helically symmetric equilibria with (a)
purely helical ﬂows (b) non-parallel ﬂows with isothermal magnetic surfaces
and the magnetic ﬁeld modulus being a surface quantity (omnigenous equi-
libria).

I. Introduction

Understanding the equilibrium properties of magnetically conﬁned plasmas
is one of the basic objectives of fusion research (see citations of Ref. [1]). In
particular, in the last ﬁfteen years, equilibria with ﬂows which are induced
when either neutral beams or/and electromagnetic power are employed to
heat the plasma of magnetic conﬁnement systems, has become an issue of
increasing interest. These ﬂows are usually associated with radial electric
ﬁelds which play a role in the transitions to the improved conﬁnement regimes
[2, 3, 4, 5].

In a series of papers [1, 6, 7, 8] we investigated the magnetohydrody-
namic (MHD) equilibrium of ideal plasmas with incompressible ﬂows and
translational as well as axial symmetry. The main conclusions of the above
mentioned studies are the following: (a) If the equilibrium ﬂows of cylindri-
cal plasmas with arbitrary cross-sectional shapes are purely poloidal, they
(b) Exact equilibria were constructed for con-
should be incompressible.
stant poloidal ﬂow Mach numbers M 2 (see deﬁnition (24) in Sec.
II) for
both cylindrical and axisymmetric conﬁgurations. (c) For the physically ap-
pealing class of cylindrical equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces their
cross-sections must be circular at large, while no restriction is imposed on
the magnetic surfaces of axisymmetric T = T (ψ) equilibria, apart from the
vicinity of the magnetic axis where they should be circular.

The aim of the present report is to extend our previous studies to the
generic case of helically symmetric ideal MHD equilibria with incompressible
ﬂows which describe the steady states of the plasmas of straight stellarators.
It is shown that the equilibrium states satisfy an elliptic partial diﬀeren-
tial equation for the helical magnetic ﬂux function ψ containing ﬁve surface
quantities along with a relation for the pressure. This is the object of Sec.
II. In Sec. III the above mentioned diﬀerential equation is transformed to
one possessing diﬀerential part identical in form to the corresponding static
equilibrium equation, which permits the derivation of several classes of ana-
lytic solutions with non-constant M 2 and diﬀerentially varying electric ﬁelds
perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces. We obtain exact solutions with ﬂows
in the symmetry direction, parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld and in arbitrary di-
rection. Equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces are then examined in
Sec. IV. Sec. V summarizes our conclusions.

The system under consideration is a helically symmetric magnetically con-
ﬁned plasma with ﬂow. To describe this conﬁguration we introduce cylin-
drical coordinates R, z, φ with z along the rotation axis; helical symmetry
implies that any physical quantity depends only on R and u = lφ + kz.
Though a helix is characterized by just one parameter, for instance a = k/l,
it is convenient to keep both l and k in order to discuss the two limiting cases
l = 0 corresponding to axisymmetry and k = 0 corresponding to translational
symmetry. Also, the vector

From Eq. (14) it follows that, unlike the case in static equilibria, I is not

Consequently, from Eqs. (13) and (14) it follows that, similar to axisymmet-
ric incompressible equilibria with purely poloidal ﬂows [1], helically symmet-
ric plasmas with purely helical ﬂows (Θ = 0) can not exist; the only possible
equilibria of this kind are cylindrical conﬁgurations with arbitrary cross sec-
tional shapes [8]. With the aid of Eq. (21), Eq. (18) can be integrated to

Ps(ψ) is the static part of the pressure which does not vanish when v = 0.

This is the equilibrium equation for a helically symmetric plasma with in-
compressible ﬂows. Eq. (25) contains the arbitrary surface quantities F (ψ),
Φ(ψ), X(ψ), ρ(ψ) and Ps(ψ) which must be found from other physical con-
siderations. Inspection of Eqs. (25), (10) and (15) shows that the singularity
M 2 = 1 is the limit at which the conﬁnement can be assured by the toroidal

It should be noted here that the equilibrium of helically symmetric equi-
libria with incompressible ﬂows was investigated in Refs. [9, 10, 11] and [12],
where a set of an elliptic diﬀerential equation and a nonlinear algebraic equa-
tion was obtained (e. g. Eqs. (38) and (40) of Ref. [12]). Those equations,
however, are coupled (and consequently one has to solve the one equation
and then examine a posteriori whether the solutions are compatible with the
other), a property which makes the derivation of analytic solutions tedious.
On the other side, as concerns the present study, one has to solve a single
diﬀerential equation [Eq. (25)] which is decoupled from Eq. (22). Once the
solutions of Eq.
(22) determines only the pressure.
Moreover, as shown in section III, Eq. (25) can be transformed to one which

(25) are known, Eq.

Since, according to experimental evidence in stellarators [3, 4, 5], the (max-
imum) value of the ion poloidal velocity (corresponding to vh) in the edge
region during the L-H transition is of the order of 1 Km/sec and the ion
vs is satisﬁed in this
temperature is of the order of 100 eV, the scaling vh ≪
region. Therefore, the restriction M 2 < 1 is of non-operational relevance.
Also, solving Eq. (27) only is suﬃcient to determine the equilibrium because
it is not ψ(U) itself but
U which is needed to
obtain any equilibrium quantity.

(c) Non-parallel ﬂows

Equilibria of this kind are of particular interest because non-parallel ﬂows
with non-vanishing poloidal (helical) components are associated with radial
electric ﬁelds which play a role in the transitions to improved conﬁnement
regimes in tokamaks [2] and stellarators [4]. Analytic, smooth equilibrium
(27) can be derived for (i) ρ(dΦ/dU)2 = constant and
solutions of Eq.
(ii) ρ(dΦ/dU)2 = c2U, c2 = constant. Because of the departure of the
isobaric surfaces and current density surfaces from the magnetic surfaces,
however, in case (i) it is not possible to obtain physically plausible equilibria,
viz. equilibria with singly peaked density and pressure proﬁles (e. g. on
the plane u = 0) vanishing on the plasma surface, a current density proﬁle

of which is a function of the parameters Rc and λ. This proﬁle is consistent
with those observed during the L-H transition in stellarators [3, 4, 5].

III. Equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces

For fusion plasmas the thermal conduction along B is fast compared to the
heat transport perpendicular to a magnetic surface and therefore equilibria
with isothermal magnetic surfaces are of particular interest. It is recalled that
for cylindrical plasmas the relation T = T (ψ) restricts the cross sections of
the magnetic surfaces to be circular at large, while for axisymmetric plasmas
no restriction is imposed on the shape of the magnetic surfaces apart from
the vicinity of the magnetic axis where their cross sections should be circular.
Under the assumption that the plasma obeys the ideal gas low P = ˆRρT ,
Eqs. (22), (13) and (17) lead to the following expression for the magnetic
ﬁeld modulus:

2 = Ξ(ψ) +

H(ψ)

(ρΦ′/F ′)2. Consequently, apart
where Ξ(ψ)
from the case of ﬁeld aligned ﬂows (H = 0), omnigenous equilibria, viz.
equilibria with

this property also holds for axisymmetric equilibria [1].

variables, the equations aj = 0 (j = 0, . . . , 7) should be satisﬁed for all j.
Consequently, the equilibrium problem is reduced to a set of eight ordinary
non-linear diﬀerential equations for ψ containing the surface functions P (ψ),
Ps(ψ), F (ψ), Φ(ψ), X(ψ), ρ(ψ) and τ (ψ). It is therefore over-determined.
Furthermore, to completely solve the equilibrium problem, one should have
to obtain the function u(x, ψ) which by Eq. (43) satisﬁes the relation

by Eq.
equilibria with incompressible ﬂows, remains an open question. It may be
noted that from the present and our previous studies [1, 7] it turns out
that, as concerns the mathematical structure and the physical properties of
T = T (ψ) equilibria with incompressible ﬂows, there are similarities with
static omnigenous equilibria. The non-existence of three dimensional static
omnigenous equilibria has been proved in an elegant manner by Palumbo and
Balzano [20, 21]. In the presence of ﬂow, however, there are diﬃculties in
applying their method because of the departure of the isobaric and current
density surfaces from the magnetic surfaces.

IV. Conclusions

The equilibrium of helically symmetric plasmas with incompressible ﬂows
has been investigated within the framework of ideal magnetohydrodynamic
theory. For the system under consideration the equilibrium equations reduce
to a second-order elliptic partial diﬀerential equation for the helical mag-
netic ﬂux function ψ [Eq. (25)] containing the density ρ(ψ), the electrostatic
potential Φ(ψ), the static equilibrium pressure Ps(ψ), the function F (ψ) as-
sociated with the helical ﬂow and the function X(ψ) related to the magnetic
ﬁeld component along the symmetry direction in conjunction with a relation
for the pressure [Eq.
(22)]. This equation has been transformed to one,
possessing diﬀerential part identical to the corresponding static equilibrium

11

equation [Eq. (27)], which permits the construction of several classes of non-
constant Mach-number analytic solutions. We have obtained exact solutions
with ﬂows in the direction of symmetry, parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld and in
arbitrary direction with diﬀerentially varying electric ﬁelds perpendicular to
the magnetic surfaces.

For the physically appealing case of equilibria with isothermal magnetic
surfaces it has been shown that the equilibrium equations become over-
determined, viz. the equilibrium problem reduces to a set of eight ordinary
diﬀerential equations for ψ with seven surface quantities. This result is dif-
ferent from the corresponding ones of cylindrical and axisymmetric equilibria
for which the condition T (ψ) imposes only restrictions to the shapes of the
magnetic surfaces. Thus, the existence of helically symmetric equilibria with
isothermal magnetic surfaces as well as of generic three dimensional equilibria
of this kind remain open questions.

Abstract

Variational principles for magnetohydrodynamics were introduced
by previous authors both in Lagrangian and Eulerian form.
In this
paper we introduce simpler Eulerian variational principles from which
all the relevant equations of magnetohydrodynamics can be derived.
The variational principle is given in terms of six independent functions
for non-stationary ﬂows and three independent functions for stationary
ﬂows. This is less then the seven variables which appear in the standard
equations of magnetohydrodynamics which are the magnetic ﬁeld ~B
the velocity ﬁeld ~v and the density ρ.

Keywords: Magnetohydrodynamics, Variational principles

Introduction

Variational principles for magnetohydrodynamics were introduced by pre-
vious authors both in Lagrangian and Eulerian form. Sturrock [1] has dis-
cussed in his book a Lagrangian variational formalism for magnetohydro-
dynamics. Vladimirov and Moﬀatt [2] in a series of papers have discussed
an Eulerian variational principle for incompressible magnetohydrodynam-
ics. However, their variational principle contained three more functions in

addition to the seven variables which appear in the standard equations of
magnetohydrodynamics which are the magnetic ﬁeld ~B the velocity ﬁeld ~v
and the density ρ. Kats [3] has generalized Moﬀatt’s work for compressible
ﬂows but without reducing the number of functions and the computational
load. Sakurai [4] has introduced a two function Eulerian variational principle
for force-free magnetohydrodynamics and used it as a basis of a numerical
scheme, his method is discussed in a book by Sturrock [1]. A method of solv-
ing the equations for those two variables was introduced by Yang, Sturrock
& Antiochos [5]. In this work we will combine the Lagrangian of Sturrock
[1] with the Lagrangian of Sakurai [4] to obtain an Eulerian Lagrangian
principle which will depend on only six functions. The variational derivative
of this Lagrangian will give us all the equations needed to describe magne-
tohydrodynamics without any additional constraints. Furthermore, we will
show that for stationary ﬂows three functions will suﬃce in order to describe
a Lagrangian principle for magnetohydrodynamics.

We anticipate applications of this study both to stability analysis of
known magnetohydrodynamic conﬁgurations and for designing eﬃcient nu-
merical schemes for integrating the equations of ﬂuid dynamics and magne-
tohydrodynamics [6, 7, 8, 9].

The plan of this paper is as follows: ﬁrst we introduce the standard
notations and equations of magnetohydrodynamics. Next we review the La-
grangian variational principle of magnetohydrodynamics. This is followed
by a review of the Eulerian variational principles of force-free magnetohydro-
dynamics. After those introductory sections we will present the six function
Eulerian variational principles for non-stationary magnetohydrodynamics.
This will be followed by the derivation of a variational principle for station-
ary magnetohydrodynamics.

2.1 Basic equations

The standard set of equations solved for magnetohydrodynamics are given
below:

∂ ~B

~∇ · ~B = 0

(4)

∂
∂t

The following notations are utilized:
is
the temporal material derivative and ~∇ has its standard meaning in vector
calculus. ~B is the magnetic ﬁeld vector, ~v is the velocity ﬁeld vector and ρ
is the ﬂuid density. Finally p(ρ) is the pressure which we assume depends
on the density alone (barotropic case). The justiﬁcation for those equations
and the conditions under which they apply can be found in standard books
on magnetohydrodynamics (see for example [1]). Equation (1) describes the
fact that the magnetic ﬁeld lines are moving with the ﬂuid elements (”frozen”
magnetic ﬁeld lines), equation (2) describes the fact that the magnetic ﬁeld
is solenoidal, equation (3) describes the conservation of mass and equation
(4) is the Euler equation for a ﬂuid in which both pressure and Lorentz
magnetic forces apply. The term:

~J =

~∇ × ~B
4π

is the electric current density which is not connected to any mass ﬂow.
The number of independent variables for which one needs to solve is seven
(~v, ~B, ρ) and the number of equations (1,3,4) is also seven. Notice that
equation (2) is a condition on the initial ~B ﬁeld and is satisﬁed automatically
for any other time due to equation (1). Also notice that p(ρ) is not a variable
rather it is a given function of ρ.

2.2 Lagrangian variational principle of magnetohydrodynam-

ics

A Lagrangian variational principle of magnetohydrodynamics was discussed
by a number of authors (see for example [1]) and an outline of this approach
is given below. Consider the action:

in which ε(ρ) is the speciﬁc internal energy. A variation in any quantity F
for a ﬁxed position ~r is denoted as δF hence:

A ≡

L ≡ ρ(

~v2 − ε(ρ)) −

in which w = ∂(ερ)

is the speciﬁc enthalpy.

A change in a position of a ﬂuid element located at a position ~r at time
t is given by ~ξ(~r, t). A mass conserving variation of ρ takes the form (for a
proof see for example [12]):

and a magnetic ﬂux conserving variation takes the form:

A change involving both a local variation coupled with a change of element
position of the quantity F is given by:

δρ = −~∇ · (ρ~ξ)

δ ~B = ~∇ × (~ξ × ~B)

∆F = δF + (~ξ · ~∇)F

∆~v = δ~v + (~ξ · ~∇)~v.

∆~v = ∆

hence

However, since:

We obtain:

δ~v =

− (~ξ · ~∇)~v =

+ (~v · ~∇)~ξ − (~ξ · ~∇)~v

d~ξ

∂~ξ
∂t

Introducing the result of equations (8,9,13) into equation (7) and integrating
by parts we arrive at the result:

δA =

in which a summation convention is assumed. Taking into account the
continuity equation (3) we obtain:

δA =

hence we see that if δA = 0 for a ~ξ vanishing at the initial and ﬁnal times and
on the surface of the domain but otherwise arbitrary then Euler’s equation
~∇p
(4) is satisﬁed (taking into account that in the barotropic case ~∇w =
ρ ).
Although the variational principle does give us the correct dynamical

equation for an arbitrary ~ξ, it has the following deﬁciencies:

1. Although ~ξ is quite arbitrary the variations of δρ and δ ~B are not. They
are deﬁned by the conditions given in equation (8) and equation (9).
This property is not useful for numerical schemes since ~ξ must be a
small quantity.

2. Only equation (4) is derived from the variational principle the other
equations that are needed: equation (1), equation (2) and equation (3)
are separate assumptions. Moreover equation (3) is needed in order
to derive Euler’s equation (4) from the variational principle. All this
makes the variational principle less useful.

What is desired is a variational principle from which all equations of
motion can be derived and for which no assumptions on the variations are
needed this will be discussed in the following sections.

3 Sakurai’s variational principle of force-free mag-

netohydrodynamics

Force-free magnetohydrodynamics is concerned with the case that both the
pressure and inertial terms in Euler equations (4) are physically insigniﬁcant.
Hence the Euler equations can be written in the form:

In order to describe force-free ﬁelds Sakurai [4] has proposed to represent
the magnetic ﬁeld in the following form:

Hence ~B is orthogonal both to ~∇χ and ~∇η. A similar representation was
suggested by Dungey [10, p. 31] but not in the context of variational anal-
ysis. Both χ and η are Clebsch type comoving scalar ﬁeld satisfying the
equations:

(~∇ × ~B) × ~B
4π

= ~J × ~B = 0

~B = ~∇χ × ~∇η

dχ
dt

= 0,

dη
dt

= 0

5

(16)

(17)

(18)

It can be easily shown that provided that ~B is in the form given in equation
(17) and equation (18) is satisﬁed then both equation (1) and equation (2)
are satisﬁed. Since according to equation (16) both ~∇× ~B and ~B are parallel
it follows that equation (16) can be written as:

~J · ~∇χ = 0,

~J · ~∇η = 0

(19)

Sakurai [4] has introduced an action principle from which equation (19) can
be derived:

AS ≡

LSd3xdt

Z
~B2
8π

=

(~∇χ × ~∇η)2
8π

LS ≡

(20)

Taking the variation of equation (20) we obtain:

δAS =

δLS d3xdt

Z
~B
4π

I

Z

δLS =

· (~∇δχ × ~∇η + ~∇χ × ~∇δη)

(21)

Integrating by parts and using the theorem of Gauss one obtains the result:

δAS =

d~S · [(δχ~∇η − δη ~∇χ) ×

~B
4π

]

+

d3x[δχ(~∇η · ~J) − δη(~∇χ · ~J )]

(22)

Hence if δAS = 0 for arbitrary variation δχ, δη that vanish on the boundary
of the domain one recovers the force-free Euler equations (19).

Although this approach is better than the one described in equation (6)
in the previous section in the sense that the form of the variations δχ, δη is
not constrained, it has some limitations as follows:

1. Sakurai’s approach by design is only meant to deal with force-free
magnetohydrodynamics for more general magnetohydrodynamics sce-
narios it is not adequate.

2. Sakurai’s action given equation (20) contains all the relevant physical
equations only if the conﬁguration is static (~v = 0). If the conﬁguration
is not static one needs to supply an additional two equations (18) to
the variational principle.

4 Simpliﬁed variational principle of non-stationary

magnetohydrodynamics

In the following section we will combine the approaches described in the
previous sections in order to obtain a variational principle of non-stationary
magnetohydrodynamics such that all the relevant magnetohydrodynamic
equations can be derived from for unconstrained variations. The approach
is based on a method ﬁrst introduced by Seliger & Whitham [11]. Consider
the action:

Ld3xdt

L ≡ L1 + L2

L1 ≡ ρ(

~v2 − ε(ρ)) +

Obviously ν, α, β are Lagrange multipliers which were inserted in such a way
that the variational principle will yield the following equations:

+ ~∇ · (ρ~v) = 0

ρ

~B =

ˆ~B ≡ ~∇χ × ~∇η

(24)

(25)

Provided ρ is not null those are just the continuity equation (3) and the
conditions that Sakurai’s functions are comoving as in equation (18). Taking
the variational derivative with respect to ~B we see that

Hence ~B is in Sakurai’s form and satisﬁes equation (2). By virtue of equa-
tions (24) we see that ~B must also satisfy equation (1). For the time being
we have showed that all the equations of magnetohydrodynamics can be
obtained from the above variational principle except Euler’s equations. We
will now show that Euler’s equations can be derived from the above vari-
ational principle as well. Let us take an arbitrary variational derivative of
the above action with respect to ~v, this will result in:

δ~vA =

Z

d3xdtρδ~v · [~v − ~∇ν − α~∇χ − β ~∇η] +

d~S · δ~vρν

d~S · δ~vρν vanishes as in the case of astrophysical ﬂows for
Provided that
which ρ = 0 on the ﬂow boundary, or the case in which the ﬂuid is contained
in a vessel which induces a no ﬂux boundary condition δ~v · ˆn = 0 (ˆn is a
unit vector normal to the boundary), we see that ~v must have the following
form:

~v = ˆ~v ≡ ~∇ν + α~∇χ + β ~∇η

(27)

Let us now take the variational derivative with respect to the density ρ we
obtain:

δρA =

Hence provided that δρ vanishes on the boundary of the domain and in
initial and ﬁnal times the following equation must be satisﬁed:

=

~v2 − w

Finally we have to calculate the variation with respect to both χ and η this
will lead us to the following results:

δχA =

Provided that the correct temporal and boundary conditions are met with
respect to the variations δχ and δη we obtain the following set of equations:

4.1 Euler’s equations

We shall now show that a velocity ﬁeld given by equation (27), such that
the equations for α, β, χ, η, ν satisfy the corresponding equations (24,29,32)
must satisfy Euler’s equations. Let us calculate the material derivative of ~v:

In which we have used both equation (27) and equation (25) in the above
derivation. This of course proves that the Euler equations can be derived
from the action given in equation (23) and hence all the equations of magne-
tohydrodynamics can be derived from the above action without restricting
the variations in any way.

4.2 Simpliﬁed action

The reader of this paper might argue here that the paper is misleading.
The authors have declared that they are going to present a simpliﬁed ac-
tion for magnetohydrodynamics instead they have added ﬁve more functions

9

α, β, χ, η, ν to the standard set ~B, ~v, ρ. In the following we will show that
this is not so and the action given in equation (23) in a form suitable for a
pedagogic presentation can indeed be simpliﬁed. It is easy to show that the
Lagrangian density appearing in equation (23) can be written in the form:

L = −ρ[

(36)

In which ˆ~v is a shorthand notation for ~∇ν + α~∇χ + β ~∇η (see equation (27))
ˆ~B is a shorthand notation for ~∇χ × ~∇η (see equation (25)). Thus L has
and
four contributions:

Lboundary ≡

+ ~∇ · (νρ~v)

(37)

The only term containing ~v is L~v, it can easily be seen that this term will
lead, after we nullify the variational derivative with respect to ~v, to equation
(27) but will otherwise have no contribution to other variational derivatives.
Similarly the only term containing ~B is L ~B and it can easily be seen that this
term will lead, after we nullify the variational derivative, to equation (25)
but will have no contribution to other variational derivatives. Also notice
that the term Lboundary contains only complete partial derivatives and thus
can not contribute to the equations although it can change the boundary
conditions. Hence we see that equations (24), equation (29) and equations
(32) can be derived using the Lagrangian density ˆL in which ˆ~v replaces ~v
ˆ~B replaces ~B in the relevant equations. Furthermore, after integrating
and
the six equations (24,29,32) we can insert the potentials α, β, χ, η, ν into
equations (27) and (25) to obtain the physical quantities ~v and ~B. Hence,
the general magnetohydrodynamic problem is reduced from seven equations
(1,3,4) and the additional constraint (2) to a problem of six ﬁrst order (in

Figure 1: A thin tube surrounding a magnetic ﬁeld line

the temporal derivative) unconstrained equations. Moreover, the entire set
of equations can be derived from the Lagrangian density ˆL which is what
we were aiming to prove.

4.3 The inverse problem

In the previous subsection we have shown that given a set of functions
α, β, χ, η, ν satisfying the set of equations described in the previous subsec-
tions, one can insert those functions into equation (27) and equation (25) to
obtain the physical velocity ~v and magnetic ﬁeld ~B. In this subsection we
will address the inverse problem that is, suppose we are given the quantities
~v, ~B and ρ how can one calculate the potentials α, β, χ, η, ν? The treatment
in this section will follow closely an analogue treatment for non-magnetic
ﬂuid dynamics given by Lynden-Bell & Katz [13].

Consider a thin tube surrounding a magnetic ﬁeld line as described in

ﬁgure 1, the magnetic ﬂux contained within the tube is:

∆Φ =

Z

~B · d~S

(38)

11

and the mass contained with the tube is:

∆M =

ρd~l · d~S

Z

in which dl is a length element along the tube. Since the magnetic ﬁeld lines
move with the ﬂow by virtue of equation (1) both the quantities ∆Φ and
∆M are conserved and since the tube is thin we may deﬁne the conserved
magnetic load:

λ =

∆M
∆Φ

=

I

ρ
B

dl

in which the above integral is performed along the ﬁeld line. Obviously the
parts of the line which go out of the ﬂow to regions in which ρ = 0 has a null
contribution to the integral. Since λ is conserved it satisﬁes the equation:

By construction surfaces of constant magnetic load move with the ﬂow and
contain magnetic ﬁeld lines. Hence the gradient to such surfaces must be
orthogonal to the ﬁeld line:

Now consider an arbitrary comoving point on the magnetic ﬁeld line and
denote it by i, and consider an additional comoving point on the magnetic
ﬁeld line and denote it by r. The integral:

µ(r) =

dl + µ(i)

r

ρ
B

Z
i

is also a conserved quantity which we may denote following Lynden-Bell &
Katz [13] as the magnetic metage. µ(i) is an arbitrary number which can
be chosen diﬀerently for each magnetic line. By construction:

Also it is easy to see that by diﬀerentiating along the magnetic ﬁeld line we
obtain:

At this point we have two comoving coordinates of ﬂow, namely λ, µ obvi-
ously in a three dimensional ﬂow we also have a third coordinate. However,
before deﬁning the third coordinate we will ﬁnd it useful to work not directly
with λ but with a function of λ. Now consider the ﬂux within a surface of

dλ

= 0.

~∇λ · ~B = 0

dµ

= 0.

~∇µ · ~B = ρ

Figure 2: Surfaces of constant load

constant load Φ(λ) as described in ﬁgure 2 (the ﬁgure was given by Lynden-
Bell & Katz [13]). The ﬂux is a conserved quantity and depends only on the
load λ of the surrounding surface. Now we deﬁne the quantity:

Obviously χ satisﬁes the equations:

χ =

Φ(λ)
2π

dχ
dt

= 0,

~B · ~∇χ = 0

we will immediately show that this function is identical to Sakurai’s func-
tion deﬁned in equation (17). Let us now deﬁne an additional comoving
coordinate η∗ since ~∇µ is not orthogonal to the ~B lines we can choose ~∇η∗
to be orthogonal to the ~B lines and not be in the direction of the ~∇χ lines,
that is we choose η∗ not to depend only on χ. Since both ~∇η∗ and ~∇χ are
orthogonal to ~B, ~B must take the form:

~B = A~∇χ × ~∇η∗

However, using equation (2) we have:

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

~∇ · ~B = ~∇A · (~∇χ × ~∇η∗) = 0

13

Which implies that A is a function of χ, η∗. Now we can deﬁne a new
comoving function η such that:

η∗

η =

Z
0

A(χ, η

′∗,

dη

= 0

(50)

In terms of this function we recover the Sakurai presentation deﬁned in
equation (17):

~B = ~∇χ × ~∇η
(51)
Hence we have shown how χ, η can be constructed for a known ~B, ρ. Notice
however, that η is deﬁned in a non unique way since one can redeﬁne η for
example by performing the following transformation: η → η + f (χ) in which
f (χ) is an arbitrary function. The comoving coordinates χ, η serve as labels
of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. Moreover the magnetic ﬂux can be calculated as:

Φ =

Z

~B · d~S =

dχdη

Z

We will now show how the potentials α, β, ν can be derived.

Let us calculate the vorticity ~ω of the ﬂow. By taking the curl of equation

(27) we obtain:

~ω ≡ ~∇ × ~v = ~∇α × ~∇χ + ~∇β × ~∇η

The following identities are derived:

~ω · ~∇χ = (~∇β × ~∇η) · ~∇χ = −~∇β · ~B

~ω · ~∇η = (~∇α × ~∇χ) · ~∇η = ~∇α · ~B
(55)
Now let us perform integrations along ~B lines starting from an arbitrary
point denoted as i to another arbitrary point denoted as r.

ﬁeld line. Hence we have derived (in a non-unique way) the values of the
α, β functions. Finally we can use equation (27) to derive the function ν for
any point s within the ﬂow:

ν(s) =

(~v − α~∇χ − β ~∇η) · d~r + ν(i)

(58)

s

(53)

(54)

(56)

(57)

in which i is any arbitrary point within the ﬂow, the result will not depend
on the trajectory taken in the case that ν is single valued. If ν is not single
valued on should introduce a cut which the integration trajectory should
not cross.

4.4 Stationary magnetohydrodynamics

Stationary ﬂows are a unique phenomena of Eulerian ﬂuid dynamics which
has no counter part in Lagrangian ﬂuid dynamics. The stationary ﬂow is
deﬁned by the fact that the physical ﬁelds ~v, ~B, ρ do not depend on the
temporal coordinate. This however does not imply that the corresponding
potentials α, β, χ, η, ν are all functions of spatial coordinates alone. More-
over, it can be shown that choosing the potentials in such a way will lead to
erroneous results in the sense that the stationary equations of motion can
not be derived from the Lagrangian density ˆL given in equation (37). How-
ever, this problem can be amended easily as follows. Let us choose α, β, χ, ν
to depend on the spatial coordinates alone. Let us choose η such that:

η = ¯η − t

(59)

in which ¯η is a function of the spatial coordinates. The Lagrangian density
ˆL given in equation (37) will take the form:

ˆL = ρ(β − ε(ρ)) −

ρ(~∇ν + α~∇χ + β ~∇¯η)2 −

(~∇χ × ~∇¯η)2

(60)

The above functional can be compared with Vladimirov and Moﬀatt [2]
equation 6.12 for incompressible ﬂows in which their I is analogue to our β.
Notice however, that while β is not a conserved quantity I is.

Varying the Lagrangian ˆL =

ˆLd3x with respect to ν, α, β, χ, η, ρ leads

to the following equations:

5 Simpliﬁed variational principle of stationary mag-

netohydrodynamics

In the previous section we have shown that magnetohydrodynamics can be
described in terms of six ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations or of an action
principle from which those equations can be derived. This formalism was
shown to apply to both stationary and non-stationary magnetohydrodynam-
ics. Although for non-stationary magnetohydrodynamics we do not know at
present how the number of functions can be further reduced, for stationary
magnetohydrodynamics the situation is quite diﬀerent. In fact we will show
that for stationary magnetohydrodynamics three functions will suﬃce.
Consider equation (47), for a stationary ﬂow it takes the form:

Hence ~v can take the form:

~v · ~∇χ = 0

~v =

~∇χ × ~K
ρ

~v =

~∇χ × ~∇N
ρ

However, since the velocity ﬁeld must satisfy the stationary mass conserva-
tion equation equation (3):

~∇ · (ρ~v) = 0
(66)
We see that ~K must have the form ~K = ~∇N , where N is an arbitrary
function. Thus, ~v takes the form:

Let us now calculate ~v × ~B in which ~B is given by Sakurai’s presentation
equation (25):

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

(67)

(68)

~v × ~B = (

) × (~∇χ × ~∇η)

~∇χ × ~∇N
ρ

=

~∇χ(~∇χ × ~∇N ) · ~∇η

1
ρ

16

Since the ﬂow is stationary N can be at most a function of the three comov-
ing coordinates χ, µ, ¯η deﬁned in subsections 4.3 and 4.4, hence:

~∇N =

~∇χ +

~∇µ +

∂N
∂χ

∂N
∂µ

∂N
∂ ¯η

~∇¯η

Inserting equation (69) into equation (68) will yield:

~v × ~B =

~∇χ

(~∇χ × ~∇µ) · ~∇¯η

1
ρ

∂N
∂µ

Rearranging terms and using Sakurai’s presentation equation (25) we can
simplify the above equation and obtain:

~v × ~B = −

~∇χ

(~∇µ · ~B)

1
ρ

∂N
∂µ

However, using equation (44) this will simplify to the form:

Now let us consider equation (1); for stationary ﬂows this will take the form:

Inserting equation (71) into equation (62) will lead to the equation:

However, since N is at most a function of χ, µ, ¯η it follows that ∂N
function of χ:

∂µ is some

~v × ~B = −~∇χ

∂N
∂µ

~∇ × (~v × ~B) = 0

~∇(

∂N
∂µ

) × ~∇χ = 0

∂N
∂µ

= −F (χ)

This can be easily integrated to yield:

N = −µF (χ) + G(χ, ¯η)

Inserting this back into equation (67) will yield:

(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

Let us now replace the set of variables χ, ¯η with a new set χ′, ¯η′ such that:

χ′ =

Z

F (χ)dχ,

¯η′ =

¯η
F (χ)

This will not have any eﬀect on the Sakurai representation given in equation
(25) since:

~B = ~∇χ × ~∇η = ~∇χ × ~∇¯η = ~∇χ′

× ~∇¯η′

However, the velocity will have a simpler representation and will take the
form:

~v =

~∇χ′ × ~∇(−µ + G′(χ′, ¯η′))
ρ

in which G′ = G
F . At this point one should remember that µ was deﬁned in
equation (43) up to an arbitrary constant which can vary between magnetic
ﬁeld lines. Since the lines are labelled by their χ′, ¯η′ values it follows that we
can add an arbitrary function of χ′, ¯η′ to µ without eﬀecting its properties.
Hence we can deﬁne a new µ′ such that:

Notice that µ′ can be multi-valued; this will be discussed in somewhat more
detail in subsection 5.3. Inserting equation (81)
into equation (80) will
lead to a simpliﬁed equation for ~v:

µ′

= µ − G′

(χ′, ¯η′

)

~v =

~∇µ′ × ~∇χ′
ρ

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

In the following the primes on χ, µ, ¯η will be ignored. The above equation is
analogues to Vladimirov and Moﬀatt’s [2] equation 7.11 for incompressible
ﬂows, in which our µ and χ play the part of their A and Ψ. It is obvious
that ~v satisﬁes the following set of equations:

~v · ~∇µ = 0,

~v · ~∇χ = 0,

~v · ~∇¯η = 1

(83)

to derive the right hand equation we have used both equation (44) and
equation (25). Hence µ, χ are both comoving and stationary. As for ¯η it
satisﬁes the same equation as ¯η deﬁned in equation (59) as can be seen from
equation (61). It can be easily seen that if:

basis = (~∇χ, ~∇¯η, ~∇µ)

(84)

18

is a local vector basis at any point in space than their exists a dual basis:

dual basis =

(~∇¯η × ~∇µ, ~∇µ × ~∇χ, ~∇χ × ~∇¯η) = (

1
ρ

~∇¯η × ~∇µ
ρ

~B

, ~v,

)

(85)

Such that:

basisi · dual basisj = δij,

i, j ∈ [1, 2, 3]

(86)

in which δij is Kronecker’s delta. Hence while the surfaces χ, µ, ¯η generate
a local vector basis for space, the physical ﬁelds of interest ~v, ~B are part of
the dual basis. By vector multiplying ~v and ~B and using equations (82,25)
we obtain:

~v × ~B = ~∇χ
(87)
this means that both ~v and ~B lie on χ surfaces and provide a vector basis
for this two dimensional surface. The above equation can be compared with
Vladimirov and Moﬀatt [2] equation 5.6 for incompressible ﬂows in which
their J is analogue to our χ.

5.1 The action principle

In the previous subsection we have shown that if the velocity ﬁeld ~v is given
by equation (82) and the magnetic ﬁeld ~B is given by the Sakurai repre-
sentation equation (25) than equations (1,2,3) are satisﬁed automatically
for stationary ﬂows. To complete the set of equations we will show how
the Euler equations (4) can be derived from the action given in equation
(6) in which both ~v and ~B are given by equation (82) and equation (25)
respectively and the density ρ is given by equation (44):

In this case the Lagrangian density of equation (6) will take the form:

ρ = ~∇µ · ~B = ~∇µ · (~∇χ × ~∇η) =

∂(χ, η, µ)
∂(x, y, z)

L = ρ(

(

1
2

~∇µ × ~∇χ
ρ

)2 − ε(ρ)) −

(~∇χ × ~∇η)2
8π

and can be seen explicitly to depend on only three functions. Let us make
arbitrary small variations δαi = (δχ, δη, δµ) of the functions αi = (χ, η, µ).
Let us deﬁne the vector:

(88)

(89)

(90)

~ξ ≡ −

∂~r
∂αi

δαi

19

This will lead to the equation:

δαi = −~∇αi · ~ξ

(91)

And by virtue of equation (10) we have:

∆αi = δαi + (~ξ · ~∇)αi = 0
as one should expect since αi are comoving with the ﬂow. Making a varia-
tion of ρ given in equation (88) with respect to αi will yield equation (8).
Furthermore, taking the variation of ~B given by Sakurai’s representation
(25) with respect to αi will yield equation (9). It remains to calculate δ~v by
varying equation (82) this will yield:

(92)

δ~v = −

~v +

~∇ × (ρ~ξ × ~v)

δρ

(93)

Inserting equations (8,9,93) into equation (7) will yield:

δL = ~v · ~∇ × (ρ~ξ × ~v) −

~B · ~∇ × (~ξ × ~B)

= ~v · ~∇ × (ρ~ξ × ~v) −

Using the well known vector identity:

~A · ~∇ × ( ~C × ~A) = ~∇ · (( ~C × ~A) × ~A) + ( ~C × ~A) · ~∇ × ~A

(95)

and the theorem of Gauss we can write now equation (7) in the form:

d~S · [ρ(~ξ × ~v) × ~v −

~v2 + w)ρ~ξ]

δA =

The time integration is of course redundant in the above expression. Also
notice that we have used the current deﬁnition equation (5) and the vorticity
deﬁnition equation (53). Suppose now that δA = 0 for a ~ξ such that the
boundary term in the above equation is null but that ~ξ is otherwise arbitrary,
then it entails the equation:

Using the well known vector identity:

ρ~v × ~ω + ~J × ~B − ρ~∇(

~∇(~v2) = (~v · ~∇)~v + ~v × (~∇ × ~v)

and rearranging terms we recover the stationary Euler equation:

5.2 The case of an axial symmetric magnetic ﬁeld

Consider an axial symmetric magnetic ﬁeld such that the magnetic ﬁeld is
dependent only on the coordinate R which is the distance from the axis
of symmetry and the coordinate z which is the distance along the axis of
symmetry from an arbitrary origin on the axis. Thus:

~B = ~B(R, z)

(100)

(101)

Any axi-symmetric magnetic ﬁeld satisfying equation (2) can be represented
in the form:

~B = ~∇P × ~∇(

) + 2πRBφ ~∇(

φ
2π

φ
2π

)

In which φ is the azimuthal angle deﬁned in the conventional way and Bφ
is the component of ~B in the φ direction. The function P = P (R, z) is the
ﬂux through a circle of radius R in the z plane:

P (R, z) =

Z(R,z)

~B · d~S = 2π

Bz(R′, z)R′dR′

(102)

R

Z
0

For ﬁnite ﬁeld conﬁgurations P will have a maximum Pm = P (Rm, zm) at
some Rm, zm. This circle R = Rm will form a line toroid with the other
constant P surfaces nearby forming a nested set. There can be several such
local maxima with local nested toroids in a general conﬁguration but the
simpler case has just one.

Let us study the relations between the functions P, Bφ and the functions
χ, η given in equation (17). Assuming that the density ρ is axial symmetric
one can see the magnetic load deﬁned in equation (40) is also axial symmetric
and that the surfaces of constant load are surfaces of revolution around
the axis of symmetry. From equation (46) we deduce that χ = χ(R, z).
Expressing equation (17) in terms of the coordinates R, φ, z results in:

~B = (−

∂zχ∂φη) ˆR + (∂zχ∂Rη − ∂Rχ∂zη) ˆφ + (

∂Rχ∂φη)ˆz

(103)

1
R

1
R

In which ∂y is a short hand notation for ∂
∂y and ˆy is a unit vector perpen-
dicular to the constant y surface. Comparing equation (103) with equation
(101) we arrive with the set of equations:

∂zP = ∂zχ∂φ(2πη),

∂RP = ∂Rχ∂φ(2πη)

(104)

From which we derive the equation:

∂zP ∂Rχ − ∂RP ∂zχ = 0 ⇒ ~∇P × ~∇χ = 0

(105)

21

Hence:

P = F (χ)

(106)

where F is an arbitrary function. We deduce that P is just another type of
labelling of the load surfaces. Thus equation (104) will lead to:

∂φ(2πη) =

⇒ η =

+ ˜η(R, z)

(107)

dP
dχ

φ
2π

dP
dχ

This should be compared with the result of Young et al. [5, equation 5.1].
Substituting the above result in equation (103) will lead to the equation:

Bφ ˆφ = (∂zχ∂R ˜η − ∂Rχ∂z ˜η) ˆφ = ~∇χ × ~∇˜η

This can also be written as:

Bφ = ˆφ · (~∇χ × ~∇˜η) = ( ˆφ × ~∇χ) · ~∇˜η

Hence Bφ is proportional to the gradient of ˜η along the ˆφ × ~∇χ direction.
Since ˆφ × ~∇χ is known we can integrate along this vector to obtain a non-
unique solution for ˜η:

˜η =

Z

Bφ
| ˆφ × ~∇χ|

dl

in which dl is a line element along the ˆφ × ~∇χ line.

5.3 The case of a magnetic ﬁeld on a toroid

Our previous deﬁnitions of the surfaces of constant load given in equation
(40) is ambiguous when the ﬁeld lines are ”surface ﬁlling” eg on a toroid and
give no result when the ﬁeld lines are ”volume ﬁlling”. At equilibrium ~B
and ~v lie in surfaces (there is an exception when ~B and ~v are parallel and ﬁll
volumes). Our former considerations apply unchanged if these surfaces have
the topology of cylinders but they need generalization when the surfaces have
the topology of toroids nested on a line. We consider a surface Σ spanning
that line toroid. Each toroid T will meet Σ in a loop. Consider the magnetic
ﬂux Φ(T ) through that part of Σ within the loop and the mass enclosed by
the toroid m(T ). The the mass outside the toroid is ˜m(T ) = M − m(T ).
Now express ˜m as a function ˜m(Φ) of the magnetic ﬂux Φ, then a deﬁnition
of magnetic load analogous to that for ”cylinders” parallel to the axis is:

(108)

(109)

(110)

(111)

λ =

d ˜m
dΦ

22

However, there are now two loads corresponding to the two ﬂuxes associated
with a given toroid. The other load is obtained by taking a cut across the
”short” circle section of the torus say of constant φ. The magnetic ﬂux Φ∗
through such a cross section may be expressed as a function of the total
mass m(T ) within the toroid and

is a second diﬀerent load. Of course it is also permissible to reexpress the
ﬂux Φ∗ as a function of the ﬂux Φ then we ﬁnd:

λ∗

=

dm
dΦ∗

λ∗ =

dm
dΦ∗ =

dm
dΦ
dΦ∗
dΦ

= −

λ
dΦ∗
dΦ

(112)

(113)

The surfaces of constant λ are of course the toroids T which also have λ∗
constant.

A similar problem may arise with the deﬁnition of the magnetic metage
deﬁned in equation (43). We may wish to deﬁne this quantity using the
magnetic ﬁeld ~B and velocity ﬁeld ~v. Since those vectors provide a vector
basis on the load surface, they can be combined in such a way say: ~B +γ(χ)~v
to create a vector which is directed along the large loop of the toroid. (A
diﬀerent γ will leave only twists around the short way.) This combination
represents an unwinding of the ﬁeld lines so that they no longer twist around
the short (long) way. Those loops can be thought as composing the surface
Σ. Another surface Σ′ also composed of such untwisted loops can be so
chosen that the mass between Σ and Σ′ and between loads λ and λ + dλ is
dλ dλ. Such Σ′ form suitable constant metage surfaces
some ﬁxed fraction of dm
µ corresponding to partial loads λ. Notice that 2πµ then describes the angle
from Σ turned around the toroid by the short way to reach any chosen point.
Similar use of the other load λ∗ allows us to deﬁne another generalized angle
µ∗ measured around the long way. A somewhat less physical approach is
given below.

Let us consider a toroid of constant magnetic load. Dungey [10, p. 31]
has considered the case in which magnetic ﬁeld lines lie on a torus. He has
shown that one of the functions (ie η) involved in the representation (17)
should be non-single valued and therefore a cut should be introduced.

In order to obtain a simple looking cuts we will replace the previous set

of functions µ, η with a new set φ∗, η∗, which will be deﬁned as follows:

φ∗

≡

µ + G(χ)η
Ω(χ)

23

Figure 3: A torus of magnetic ﬁeld lines

η∗ ≡

η − φ∗
f (χ)

(114)

G, Ω, f are arbitrary functions of χ. Therefore µ and η can be given in terms
of φ∗, η∗ as:

+ f (χ)η∗

η = φ∗
µ = −G(χ)η + Ω(χ)φ∗
(115)
η∗ can be considered as an angle varying over the small circle of the torus,
while φ∗ can be considered as an angle varying over the large circle of the
torus as in ﬁgure (3). On the torus of constant magnetic load the φ∗, η∗
functions have a simple ”cut” structure. The above equation can also serve
as a ”deﬁnition” of µ.
Inserting equations (115) into equation (17) and
equation (82) will result in the following set of equations:

~B = ~∇χ × ~∇φ∗ + f (χ)~∇χ × ~∇η∗

~v = G(χ)

+ Ω(χ)

~B
ρ

~∇φ∗ × ~∇χ
ρ

(116)

Hence ~B is partitioned into two vectors circulating along the small and
large circles of the torus. While ~v has two vector components one along the
magnetic ﬁeld ~B and another along the small circle.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we have reviewed variational principles for magnetohydrody-
namics given by previous authors both in Lagrangian and Eulerian form.
Furthermore, we introduced our own Eulerian variational principles from
which all the relevant equations of magnetohydrodynamics can be derived
and which are in some sense simpler than those considered earlier. The
variational principle was given in terms of six independent functions for
non-stationary ﬂows and three independent functions for stationary ﬂows.
This is less then the seven variables which appear in the standard equations
of magnetohydrodynamics which are the magnetic ﬁeld ~B the velocity ﬁeld
~v and the density ρ.

The problem of stability analysis and the description of numerical schemes
using the described variational principles exceed the scope of this paper. We
suspect that for achieving this we will need to add additional constants of
motion constraints to the action as was done by [14, 15] see also [16], hope-
fully this will be discussed in a future paper.

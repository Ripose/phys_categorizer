Abstract. Relativistic solitons are self-trapped, ﬁnite size, electromagnetic
waves of relativistic intensity that propagate without diﬀraction spreading. They
have been predicted theoretically within the relativistic ﬂuid approximation, and
have been observed in multi–dimensional particle in cell simulations of laser pulse
interaction with the plasma. Solitons were observed in the laser irradiated plasmas
with the proton imaging technique as well. This paper reviews many theoretical
results on relativistic solitons in electron–ion plasmas.

1. Introduction

Relativistic solitons are self–trapped, ﬁnite size, electromagnetic waves of relativistic
intensity (eE/mωc
1) that propagate without diﬀraction spreading. Many diﬀerent
physical eﬀects play a role in the formation of relativistic solitons: dispersion eﬀects
due to the ﬁnite particle inertia, nonlinearities due to relativistic mass increase, as
well as ponderomotive eﬀects which force the plasma density redistribution.

≥

The theoretical investigation of relativistic solitons in electron–ion plasmas is a
relatively old problem in plasma physics, which has been treated by many authors
in the past, and has recently gained new attention in the literature [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The analyses have been performed mainly in the
framework of the 1D relativistic ﬂuid approximation, in which solitons are described
by the solutions of a set of coupled nonlinear diﬀerential equations for the electrostatic
and electromagnetic potentials with suitable boundary conditions.

Relativistic solitons have been seen in multi-dimensional particle in cell (PIC)
as well as in ﬂuid simulations of laser pulse interaction with the plasma [17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. These solitons consist of electron density depressions and intense
electromagnetic ﬁeld concentrations with a larger amplitude and a lower frequency
than those of the laser pulse. Since a signiﬁcant portion of the overall electromagnetic
energy is trapped in the form of solitons, solitary waves can play an important role in
the laser–plasma interaction.

2. 1D relativistic solitons

Here, the theory of 1D circularly polarized solitons is presented within the relativistic
hydrodynamic approximation used to describe both the electron and ion components

[5, 10, 11]. The plasma is assumed to be cold with zero ion and electron temperature.
Length, time, velocity, momentum, vector and scalar potential, and density are
normalized over c/ωpe, ωpe, c, mαc, mec2/e, and n0, respectively, being ωpe =
(4πn0e2/me)1/2 the electron plasma frequency, mα the rest mass with α = e, i, and
n0 the unperturbed electron (and ion) density. In the Coulomb gauge, the Maxwell’s
equations for the vector and scalar potentials, A and φ, and the hydrodynamic
equations (continuity, and momentum balance) for the densities nα and the canonical
momentum Pα of electrons and ions can be written as

shock waves (occurring in the cold plasma limit) are collisionless, and similar to

2.2. Bright solitons in e–i plasma

In the case of large amplitude bright solitons, a wide class of solutions can be found.
Here, the analysis is restricted to the class of solutions with single humped φ proﬁles,
and a proﬁles characterized by the number of nodes p. For ﬁxed V , the eigenspectrum
of the bright solitons can been determined solving numerically Eqs. (6-7) with suitable
boundary conditions [5, 10].

The eigenspectrum relevant for low p values is shown in ﬁgure 1, both for the case
in which the ions are ﬁxed, i.e., at ρ = 0, and for the case in which the ion dynamics
is taken into account.

ion dynamics), respectively. Both the regions corresponding to the continuos
spectrum of single–peaked solitons and the discrete spectrum for p = 0, . . . , 4 are
shown. The dashed curve in frame (b) delimits a region of no solutions.

When the ion dynamics is neglected (i.e., ρ = 0), the bright soliton eigenspectrum
has the following features. Single-peaked solitons (p = 0) admit a continuous spectrum
for any velocity value [13]. In particular, standing stable solitons (V = 0) are found

analytically in [9]. Multi–peaked solitons (p
1) have a discrete spectrum for
velocities larger than a small critical value, and at ﬁxed V , the frequency ω decreases
with increasing p. The peak value of the potentials a and φ is found at the minimum
velocity, and increases with p [11].

≥

Quite diﬀerent results are found when the ion dynamics is taken into account
(i.e., ρ
= 0), even at a ﬁnite propagation speed. Note that at high frequencies (and
velocities), the ion dynamics does not play any role. Single–humped solutions are
found for velocities larger than Vs ≈
√ρ [5], with both a continuous spectrum [13]
and a discrete spectrum [10]. For p
1, only a discrete spectrum is found [10]. At
≥
low p values, the frequency is non monotonous as a function of V , and at V = Vbr the
branch ends since the soliton breaks. The structure of the solution for p = 0, 1, 2 and
a velocity value close to breaking is shown in ﬁgure 2, where the potential waveforms
are plotted. It is found that the ions pile at the soliton center, while the electrons
at its edges, giving rise to very peaked density distributions, and breaking occurs
because the ion density diverges in the center. At the same time, the ion and electron
velocities tend to Vbr at the center of the soliton and at its edges, respectively, so
that in these regions the particles move with almost the group velocity of the soliton.
The ion velocity proﬁle shows a cusp in the center, which is the signature of the
nonlinear wavebreaking. The soliton breaking provides a novel mechanism for the ion
acceleration in the high intensity laser pulse interaction with plasmas [10].

Solitons at large p number have been investigated numerically and analytically in

diﬀerent approximations [6, 7, 8, 13].

2.3. Dark solitons in e-i plasma

As already pointed out, dark solitons are found only when the ion dynamics is taken
into account and at very low velocities (V . √ρ). The solutions of the full nonlinear
= 0 are obtained numerically, as in the case of bright solitons [12]. The
system for a0
obtained spectrum and the corresponding a0 value are shown in ﬁgure 3 as a function
of the velocity. At ﬁxed V , the spectrum is continuous at low a0, and it becomes
discrete above a threshold value, which increases with V . The discrete spectrum
is made up by a large number of separate branches, each of them characterized by
diﬀerent densities and velocities proﬁles. The ion density proﬁle show always a dip,
while at large a0 the electron density tends to peak in the region inside the soliton. At
a critical amplitude value (dependent on V ) breaking of the solutions occurs, due to
0.051, and
the peaking of the electron density. Solitary solutions are found up to V

potentials for dark solitons (black and gray) and the shock wave.

2.4. Warm plasma eﬀects

The results described in the previous section have been derived in the cold plasma
approximation. However, it can be easily argued that solitons moving at “low” velocity
can be aﬀected by pressure terms. The theoretical investigation of temperature eﬀects
has been performed within the quasineutral approximation for standing solitons in
a fully relativistic treatment [14], and for the case of moving solitons in the weakly
relativistic approximation [15]. The results are summarized in table 2 [15], which refer
to small ﬁnite amplitude solitons and non relativistic temperatures.

As expected, temperature eﬀects play a crucial role in the range 0

the process of soliton formation in a warm plasma. In particular, the formation of
single-peaked solitons is observed at zero and very low propagation speed, lower than
the ion acoustic speed. The relevant electron and ion density proﬁles show a dip in
the center of the soliton. In the low temperature limit, density depletion in the center
of standing solitons may become almost total [14].

3. Solitons in laser plasma simulations

Relativistic solitons has been investigated with the help of ﬂuid simulations and 2D, 3D
PIC simulations for laser–plasma interaction [17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23]. The mechanism of
soliton generation by a high intensity laser pulse propagating in a underdense plasma
can be descibed as follows. The laser pulse interacting with the plasma loses its
energy, as it generates wake ﬁelds behind itself. Since the process is adiabatic the ratio
between the e. m. energy density and the frequency is conserved, so that frequency
downshift occurs for the wake ﬁeld. Moreover, since the group velocity of the laser
pulse decreases with the frequency, the low frequency part of the e. m. radiation of
the pulse propagates with very low velocity. When the frequency becomes lower than
the Langmuir frequency, the e. m. energy becomes trapped inside the related density
cavity, thus forming a slowly moving solitary structure. Note that in 2D and 3D it is
found that solitary waves can merge, thus they are not strictly speaking solitons. It
has been observed that a large part of the laser pulse energy can be transformed into
solitons [19]. It can then be argued that solitary waves may play an important role in
the laser–plasma interaction.

When PIC simulations are performed in inhomogeneous plasmas [20], it is found
that low frequency solitary waves generated by superintense laser pulses are accelerated
along the density gradient towards the lowest density values (e.g., the plasma–vacuum
interface) where they radiate their energy in the form of low frequency electromagnetic
bursts. This process can be a signature of soliton formation.

PIC simulations show that the time of the soliton formation is much shorter than
the ion response time, so that ions can be assumed at rest during this process. For
approximately (mi/me)1/2 oscillation periods of the e. m. ﬁeld inside the soliton
(which is of the order of 2π/ωpe), the ions can be assumed as ﬁxed. For longer times,
the ponderomotive force starts to dig a hole in the ion density, and the parameters of
the solitons change. What was a soliton on the electron timescale is no more a soliton
on the ion timescale. Nevertheless, a low frequency e. m. wave packet remains well
conﬁned inside a slowly expanding plasma cavity. This e. m. entity has been called a
postsoliton [21].

Dynamics of Relativistic Solitons

for
In addition, 1D ﬂuid simulations in “slightly” overdense plasmas (i.e.,
plasma densities . 1.5 times the critical density) have shown that penetration of
relativistically intense laser radiation occurs by soliton–like structures moving into
the plasma [24].

4. Final remarks

Many theoretical problems are still open even for 1D solitons, as, e.g., the temperature
eﬀects at any propagation speed and arbitrary wave amplitude, the soliton dynamics
in the presence of plasma inhomogeneity, the properties of linearly polarized solitons,
and last but not least the stability of such structures (e. g., see discussions in Ref.
[16]).

In conclusion, we point out that the ﬁrst macroscopic evidence of soliton formation
in the interaction of an intense (1019 W/cm2) laser pulse with an underdense plasma
has been reported in [28]. Long-lived, macroscopic bubble–like structures have been
detected through the deﬂection that the associated electric charge separation causes
in a proton probe beam [29]. These structures are interpreted as the remnants of a
cloud of relativistic solitons generated in the plasma by the ultraintense laser pulse.

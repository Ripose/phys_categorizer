A new nonlinear electromagnetic wave mode in a plasma is reported. Its existence depends on the
interaction of an intense circularly polarized electromagnetic wave with a plasma, where quantum
electrodynamical photon–photon scattering is taken into account. As an illustration, we consider
a pair plasma and show that the new mode can be signiﬁcant in astrophysical settings and in the
next generation laser-plasma systems.

The concept of photon–photon scattering, an eﬀect
stemming from the interaction of photons with vir-
tual electron–positron pairs in quantum electrodynam-
ics (QED), has attracted attention in a number of recent
publications (see, e.g. Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4] and references
therein). Although a weak eﬀect, it is believed to be an
active ingredient of highly magnetized neutron stars [5],
giving rise to frequency down-shifting [6] and lensing [7].
Moreover, it has been suggested that the next genera-
tion laser-plasma systems would be able to produce ﬁeld
strengths close to the Schwinger ﬁeld ∼ 1018 V/m [8], at
which the vacuum becomes fully nonlinear, and photon–
photon scattering needs to be taken into account for a
full understanding of the laser-plasma dynamics.

Lasers are currently reaching powers of 1021 − 1022
W/cm2 [9, 10], and an electron in such ﬁelds can at-
tain a highly relativistic quiver velocity. Moreover, a
plasma under the inﬂuence of such intense lasers will
be highly nonlinear and the relativistic dynamics of the
laser-plasma system will thus be complicated, giving rise
to, e.g. soliton formation and pulse collapse [11]. It has
been noted that the latter of these eﬀects could be of
interest for generating electromagnetic ﬁeld intensities
above the Schwinger limit [8, 12, 13, 14]. Furthermore,
laser pulse collapse and the subsequent electron expul-
sion due to the immense ponderomotive force is able to
create plasma channels in which ultra-high intensity ﬁeld
strengths are reached [15], such that the nonlinear vac-
uum eﬀect of elastic photon–photon scattering could be-
come important [2].

In pulsar surroundings, pair production and pair plas-
mas play an important role in the dynamics of these en-
vironments (see, e.g. Refs. [16, 17, 18]). Charged par-
ticles will attain relativistic energies close to the pulsar
magnetic poles and radiate γ-ray photons. This, together
with the super-strong magnetic ﬁeld present around these
objects [16], is believed to produce a pair plasma [19].
Thus, nonlinear QED eﬀects are already known to be an
important ingredient for pulsar physics. Since the pair
plasma gives rise to radio wave emissions, and because of
the large energy scales involved, pulsar atmospheres are
likely to host other QED eﬀects as well, such as vacuum
nonlinearities in the form of photon–photon scattering.

An eﬀective theory of photon–photon scattering can be
formulated in terms of the Heisenberg–Euler Lagrangian
[20, 21]. In case a dilute plasma is present, the nonlinear-
ities associated with QED are normally many orders of
magnitude smaller than those due to the classical plasma
medium. However, here we will show that the QED pro-
cesses may, for certain conﬁgurations, give a signiﬁcant
contribution even in the presence of a plasma. In par-
ticular, we will investigate the propagation of circularly
polarized electromagnetic waves in a multi-component
low-
plasma. The QED eﬀects give rise to a novel
frequency mode, which is described by a nonlinear dis-
persion relation. The signiﬁcance of those results are
discussed together with various applications.

According to QED, the non-classical phenomenon of
photon–photon scattering can take place due to the ex-
change of virtual electron–positron pairs. This gives
rise to vacuum polarization and magnetization currents.
In terms of the Heisenberg–Euler Lagrangian density
[20, 21] we have

cE · B, α = e2/4πǫ0~c is the ﬁne structure constant,
ǫ0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the electron charge,
c the speed of light, 2π~ the Planck constant and me
the electron mass. The last terms in (1) represent
the eﬀects of vacuum polarization and magnetization,
and is the result of a perturbative expansion of the
full Heisenberg–Euler Lagrangian. The ﬁelds are there-
fore formally constrained by ω ≪ ωe and |E| ≪ Ecrit,
where ωe = c/λe = mec2/~ ≃ 8 × 1020 rad/s and
Ecrit = m2
ec3/e~ ∼ 1018 V/m, λe ≃ 4 × 1013 m being
the Compton wavelength and Ecrit the Schwinger ﬁeld
strength. However, it can be shown that the Lagrangian
(1) is valid upto ﬁeld strengths surpassing the Schwinger
ﬁeld, as long as c|B| ≥ |E| is order to avoid pair cre-
ation [22, 23]. The QED corrected Maxwell’s vacuum
equations take the classical form using D = ǫ0E + P and
H = (B/µ0) − M , where P and M are of third order
in the ﬁeld amplitudes E and B, as shown below in Eqs.
(3a) and (3b) respectively, and µ0 = 1/c2ε0.

where we have assumed that the EM-ﬁelds vary as
exp(ikz − iωt). Due to the high symmetry of the cir-
cularly polarized EM waves, most plasma nonlineari-
ties cancel, and the above substitution therefore holds
for arbitrary wave amplitudes, provided that the plasma
frequency depends on the electromagnetic amplitude

Next, we investigate the regime ω2 ≪ k2c2. From
Faraday’s law and the above inequality we note that the
dominating QED contribution to Eq. (2b) comes from
the term proportional to B2B. Combining Eqs.
(2b)
0 /ω2 is constant
and (3b), noting that B2 = B2
for circularly polarized EM waves, and using ω2 ≪ k2c2,
i.e. M ≃ 4c4ξB2B and |M| ≫ ω|P|/k, we thus obtain
from (2b) the nonlinear dispersion relation

This low-frequency mode makes the particle motion

We note that the ratio ωe/ωp0 is much larger than unity
for virtually all plasmas, i.e.
for electron densities up
to ∼ 1038 m−3. In some applications, such as in pulsar
astrophysics, it is convenient to re-express the dispersion
relation in terms of the relativistic gamma factor using
E0/Ecrit ≃ (ω/ωe)γ. Thus, we obtain

Astrophysical environments may exhibit extreme
ﬁelds.
Neutron stars have surface magnetic ﬁeld
strengths of the order of 1010 − 1013 G, while magne-
tars can reach 1014 − 1015 G [5], coming close to en-
ergy densities corresponding the Schwinger limit; here,
the quantum vacuum becomes fully nonlinear. Single-
particle QED eﬀects, such as photon splitting can play
a signiﬁcant role in the understanding and interpreta-
tion of observations from these extreme systems [6, 27].
In fact, the pair plasma creation in pulsar environments
itself rests on nonlinear QED vacuum eﬀects. The emis-
sion of short wavelength photons due to the accelera-
tion of plasma particles close to the polar caps results in
a production of electrons and positrons as the photons
propagate through the pulsar intense magnetic ﬁeld [16].
The precise density of the pair plasma created in this
fashion is diﬃcult the estimate, and the answer is model
dependent. However, given the Goldreich–Julian density
nGJ = 7 × 1015(0.1 s/P )(B/108 T) m−3, where P is the
pulsar period and B the pulsar magnetic ﬁeld, the pair
plasma density is expected to satisfy n0 = M nGJ, M
being the multiplicity [16, 28]. The multiplicity is deter-
mined by the model through which the pair plasma is as-
sumed to be created, but a moderate estimate is M = 10
[28]. Thus, with these pre-requisites, the density in a hot
dense pair plasma is of the order 1018 m−3, and the pair
plasma experiences a relativistic factor ∼ 102 − 103 [18].
Using these estimates in (7), we obtain λ ∼ 10−12−10−11
m [35]. On the other hand, the primary beam will have
n0 ∼ nGJ and γ ∼ 106 − 107 [18], at which (7) yields
λ ∼ 10−8 − 10−7 m.

At the laboratory level, current high laser powers are
able to accelerate particles to highly relativistic speeds.
Furthermore, pulse self-compression in laser-plasma sys-
tems may play an important role in attaining power lev-
els well above current laser limits (see, e.g. Refs. [8, 29]).

As the intensities approach the Schwinger limit in future
laser-plasma setups, eﬀects of pair-creation and photon–
photon scattering have to be taken into account [8, 30].
Laser-plasma systems can have electron densities of the
order 1026 m−3, and laser intensities can be close to
1023 − 1025 W/cm2 [9, 13]. Moreover, as stated in Ref.
[8], laser self-focusing in plasmas could reach Ecrit, at
which pair creation is likely to follow.
In fact, it has
been estimated that the National Ignition Facility would
be able to produce pairs by direct irradiation of a deu-
terium pellet [31]. On the other hand, the creation of
laboratory electron–positron plasmas is already a feasi-
ble task [32, 33], as is the usage of these plasmas for
making pair plasma experiments [34]. Thus, the possi-
bility to study laser-plasma interactions in pair plasmas
could be a reality in the nearby future. The currently
available positron densities in the laboratories are well
below those of regular laser plasma systems, but accord-
ing to Ref. [31] there is a possibility of reaching densities
of order 1027 m−3. Thus, using n0 ∼ 1026 m−3, and the
ﬁeld intensity 1016 V/m (due to laser self-compression
[8]) at the wavelength 0.3 × 10−6 m, we ﬁnd from Eq. (6)
that ω ≃ 7.8 × 105 rad/s, i.e. the frequency is in the LF
band.

To summarize, we have presented a new low-frequency
circularly polarized electromagnetic wave in an electron-
positron plasma, taking into account the combined ac-
tion of relativistic charged particle mass variation and
the QED eﬀect involving photon–photon scattering. The
wave frequency strongly depends on the wave amplitude.
The present mode is shown to play an important role in
astrophysical settings as well as in the next generation
laser-plasma systems.

Relativistic eﬀects on dispersion in a degenerate electron gas are discussed by comparing known
response functions derived relativistically (by Jancovici) and nonrelativistically (by Lindhard). The
main distinguishing feature is one-photon pair creation, which leads to logarithmic singularities in the
response functions. Dispersion curves for longitudinal waves have a similar tongue-like appearance in
the relativistic and nonrelativistic case, with the main relativistic eﬀects being on the Fermi speed
and the cutoﬀ frequency. For transverse waves the nonrelativistic treatment has a nonphysical
feature near the cutoﬀ frequency for large Fermi momenta, and this is attributed to an incorrect
treatment of the electron spin. We ﬁnd (with two important provisos) that one-photon pair creation
is allowed in superdense plasmas, implying relatively strong coupling between transverse waves and
pair creation.

INTRODUCTION

Dispersion in a completely degenerate electron gas was ﬁrst studied in connection with plasmons in the context
of solid state systems [1, 2]. Both the longitudinal and transverse response functions for a completely degenerate,
nonrelativistic electron gas were calculated by Lindhard [3], and Lindhard’s longitudinal response function continues
to be used widely. The implied dispersion relation for plasmons is sound-like with the sound speed replaced by the
Fermi speed, vF, up to a maximum frequency where it turns over and joins onto the dispersion curve for zero sound [4],
giving a tongue-like appearance on a frequency-wavenumber, ω-|k|, plot. The properties of transverse waves implied
by Lindhard’s transverse response function seem to have been given relatively little attention. The generalization of
the response functions to a completely degenerate, relativistic electron gas was carried out by Jancovici [5], and used
to discuss relativistic eﬀects in connection with the longitudinal response [6], the cutoﬀ frequencies for longitudinal
and transverse waves [7], the corrections for a nonzero temperature [8], and ﬂuctuations [9]. The properties of
longitudinal and transverse waves in the interiors of compact stars (white dwarf stars, neutron stars and strange
stars) are of relevance to neutrino emission from such dense plasmas; one of the mechanisms for neutrino production,
called the plasma process, involves the decay of a wave quantum into a neutrino/anti-neutrino pair [10].
In this
context, in Ref. [11] the dispersion relations for these waves were plotted over a restricted range using the Jancovici
response functions, and most subsequent authors used the ‘semi-classical’ approximation to the response functions
[12, 13, 14, 15, 16], in which the quantum recoil is neglected.

In this paper we discuss relativistic quantum eﬀects on dispersion in a completely degenerate electron gas. We
concentrate on four speciﬁc aspects: (a) the generalization of the properties of longitudinal waves in a nonrelativistic
degenerate electrons gas, as described in Ref. [4], to the relativistic case; (b) the diﬀerences between the results derived
using the nonrelativistic (Lindhard) and relativistic (Jancovici) forms, particularly for transverse waves; and (c) the
validity of the semi-classical approximation, particularly in a superdense plasma, in which the plasma frequency is of
order the electron mass (we use natural units, ¯h = c = 1); and (d) the possible existence of pair modes.

The response functions can be expressed as integrals over the distribution of particles in momentum space, with
the dispersion and dissipation determined primarily by a resonant denominator. The integrals can be expressed
such that the denominator is (ω − k · v)2 in the nonrelativistic, nonquantum case, (ω − k · v)2 − |k|4/4m2 in the
nonrelativistic quantum case, and (ku)2 − (k2/2m)2 in the relativistic quantum case, with ku = γ(ω − k · v) and
k2 = ω2 − |k|2. A characteristic feature of a relativistic quantum treatment is the existence of an additional source
of dissipation and dispersion compared with a nonrelativistic treatment; besides Landau damping (LD), modiﬁed by
the quantum recoil, one-photon pair creation (PC) is possible. LD is possible only for ω < |k| and PC is possible only
for ω > (4m2 + |k|2)1/2, with the intermediate region dissipation free (DF) [17]. A notable diﬀerence between LD
and PC is that the contributions from the electron gas to the dissipation have opposite signs: PC occurs in vacuo,
and PC due to the electron gas partially (or totally) suppresses the PC (due to the vacuum) that would otherwise
occur. Dispersion is related to dissipation, through causality, and the existence of PC implies the existence of an
additional source of dispersion in a relativistic quantum gas. Unlike dissipation, the dispersive eﬀect is not restricted
to a particular region of ω-|k| space.

In section 2 we write down the plasma response functions for a degenerate electron gas used in our calculations: the
Jancovici, Lindhard and semi-classical forms. In section 3 we plot the response functions, as functions of ω for ﬁxed

|k|, and in section 4 we plot the dispersion relations for longitudinal and transverse waves. We discuss the results in
section 5, and our conclusions are summarized in section 6.

2. RESPONSE FUNCTIONS

We deﬁne the response tensor, P µν(k), such that the induced 4-current, J µ(k), in the medium is related to the
4-potential, Aµ(k), by J µ(k) = P µ
ν(k)Aν (k). In an isotropic plasma, the response may be described in terms of the
longitudinal part, P L(k), and transverse part, P T (k), of the response tensor. In this section we write down these
response functions for a completely degenerate, electron gas in the relativistic [5], nonrelativistic [3], and semi-classical
cases.

with ωc the cutoﬀ frequency (referred to as the plasma frequency by some authors), and vF = pF/εF the Fermi
speed. Approximate forms similar to (7) and (8) were given by Lindhard (1954) and Jancovici (1962). In Ref. [12]
the additional approximation vF → 1 is made in (7) and (8), corresponding to a highly relativistic electron gas.

2.4. Response functions for the vacuum

The vacuum polarization tensor is of the form P µν(k) = P0(k)[gµν − kµkν/k2], and the form of P0(k) is well
0 (k) = ω2P0(k)/(ω2 − |k|2)
known [20]. The longitudinal and transverse parts of the vacuum response tensor are P L
and P T
0 (k) = P0(k), respectively, which are to be added to the contributions from the electron gas. The real part
is unimportant for present purposes, but it is essential to include the imaginary part of vacuum polarization when
discussing dissipation due to PC. It has the speciﬁc form [20]

for ω2 − |k|2 > 4m2, with Im P0(k) = 0 for ω2 − |k|2 < 4m2.

2.5. Allowed regions for dissipation

The allowed regions for LD and PC are illustrated in Figure 1 for pF/m = 0.5. Of particular relevance to the
2
discussion below is the region where PC is allowed. PC is allowed in principle only for ω > (4m2 + |k|
)1/2. The
completely degenerate electron gas suppresses PC completely in a small contiguous region at higher ω and small |k|,
2
)1/2 < ω < εF + εpF−|k|, where εpF±|k| = [m2 + (pF ± |k|)2]1/2 are threshold energies. For
corresponding to (4m2 + |k|
2
|k| = 0 this precludes PC for ω < 2εF, as pointed out in Ref. [11]. However, the region at ω > (4m2 + |k|
)1/2 where
PC is completely suppressed by the degenerate electron gas is restricted to |k| < 2pF. A closely analogous situation
applies to PC in a magnetized electron gas, and plot similar to Figure 1 was used in Ref. [21] to illustrate this case.

3. PLOTS OF THE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS

Figure 2 shows plots for |k| = 0.1m. The upper and lower panels show the response function on two diﬀerent scales,
with the upper panel emphasizing the region where LD is allowed and the dispersion is dominated by that associated
(by the Kramer-Kronig relations) with LD, and with the lower panel emphasizing the region where PC is allowed and
where dispersion associated with PC is important. The regions where LD and PC are allowed are shown shaded in
the two panels, respectively. The short-dashed and long-dashed vertical lines correspond to ω = |εF − εpF−|k|| and
ω = εpF−|k| − εF, respectively, in the upper panel, and to ω = εF + εpF−|k| and ω = εF + εpF+|k|, respectively, in the
lower panel. These values of ω deﬁne the boundaries between the diﬀerently shaded regions within the LD and PC
regimes in Figure 1. In general, for |k| < 2pF, LD is possible for ω < εpF+|k| − εF, and it changes its analytic form at

4

ω = εF − εpF−|k|. PC due to the electron gas is possible only for εF + εpF−|k| < ω < εF + εpF+|k|, where it partially
or totally suppressed PC due to the vacuum.

Figure 3 shows plots of Re µ0P L/m2 as a function of ω for |k| = 2m. In Figure 2(a), LD is only allowed between
)1/2. The vacuum PC is partially suppressed by

the vertical lines. In Figure 2(b), PC is allowed for ω > (4m2 + |k|
the contribution of the electrons between the short and long dashed lines.

2

The response function varies greatly in magnitude over the entire frequency range, and in Figure 4 we plot
log |Re µ0P L(k)/m2| to show the changes on the larger scale. Figure 4(a), (b) and (c), show the logarithm over
the entire frequency range and over ranges similar to those in Figures 2(a), (b), respectively. The logarithm intro-
duces singularities at points where Re µ0P L(k) passes through zero, as is evident by noting that the downward-pointing
cusp-like feature in Figure 4(b) corresponds to the point where the response function changes sign in Figure 2(a).

3.1. Transverse response function

The transverse response function exhibits features similar to the longitudinal response function.

In Figure 5
log |Re µ0P T (k)/m2| is plotted in the format used in Figure 4. The downward pointing cusp-like feature in Fig-
ure 5(b) corresponds to a change in sign of the response function, from positive at low frequency to negative at high
frequency. The vertical lines correspond to the boundaries of the allowed dissipation regions, and are the same as in
Figure 4.

3.2. Comparison of Jancovici, Lindhard and semi-classical forms

In Figure 6 we compare the longitudinal and transverse response functions for the three diﬀerent forms written
down in section 2: the Jancovici form, (1) and (2), the Lindhard form, (5) and (6), and the semi-classical form, (7)
and (8). The values chosen are ω/m = 0.01 and pF/m = 0.1, and the response functions are plotted as a function of
|k|/m. For |k| < ω all three forms give similar results. The Lindhard form deviates substantially from the Jancovici
form for |k| >

∼ 5ω, and the Lindhard form becomes an increasingly poor approximation as |k|/ω increases further.

The important requirements for the semi-classical approximation to be accurate are ω/εF ≪ 1 and |k| ≪ 2pF. For
the longitudinal response, the semi-classical result is a poor approximation for large |k| ≪ 2pF but the Lindhard form
is accurate for arbitrarily large |k|/2pF, provided one has ω ≪ m, pF ≪ m. For the transverse response, both the
semi-classical and the Lindhard forms are poor approximations for suﬃciently large |k|/2pF.

4. WAVE DISPERSION

The dispersion equations for longitudinal and transverse modes in the rest frame of the plasma are

ω2 + µ0P L(k) = 0,

ω2 − |k|2 + µ0P T (k) = 0,

(10)

respectively. In this section we give numerical and analytic results for the longitudinal and transverse modes in a
completely degenerate electron gas.

4.1. Longitudinal modes

The longitudinal mode of a thermal electron gas is usually called the Langmuir mode. For longitudinal waves in a
nonrelativistic degenerate electron gas, there is a highest frequency [18], where there is a turnover of the dispersion
relation [4]. In the discussion here we concentrate on the relativistic generalization of this known nonrelativistic result.
Speciﬁcally, we compare the dispersion relation for Langmuir waves calculated using Lindhard’s response function,
with that calculated using Jancovici’s response function.

Numerical results are shown in Figure 7 for pF/m = 0.05, 0.5, 5. The wave modes are double valued, giving a tongue-
like appearance of the dispersion curve, with the maximum frequency near the tip of the tongue, in agreement with [4].
The dispersion curves calculated using the Lindhard and Jancovici response functions have negligible diﬀerences in
the nonrelativistic regime, as shown for pF/m = 0.05. There are two obvious diﬀerences for larger pF. One diﬀerence
is that the tongue-like feature has a steeper slope with Lindhard’s form than with Jancovici’s form. This may be
attributed to the tongue-like feature being aligned approximately along ω = |k|vF, with the Fermi speed given by
vF = pF/m in Lindhard’s form and by the relativistically correct value vF = pF/εF in Jancovici’s form. The other

5

(11)

obvious diﬀerence is in the cutoﬀ frequency. For Lindhard’s form, the cutoﬀ frequency is the plasma frequency, ωp,
given by ω2

F/3π2. With Jancovici’s form, the cutoﬀ frequency, ωc, is determined by [7]

p = e2ne/ε0m, with ne = p3

The cutoﬀ frequency (11) reduces to the nonrelativistic plasma frequency in the nonrelativistic limit but, as in any
relativistic electron gas, is lowered by relativistic eﬀects in a relativistic plasma. Note that some authors refer to the
cutoﬀ frequency as the ‘plasma frequency’, but we adopt the more conventional deﬁnition in plasma physics, in which
a distinction is made between the plasma frequency, ωp as deﬁned above, the proper plasma frequency, ωp0, deﬁned
in terms of the proper number density, ne0 = [εFpF/m2 − ln(εF/m + pF/m)]/2π2 here, and the cutoﬀ frequency,
determined by (11). The term −ω2
c in the denominator on the right hand side of (11) is due to the relativistic
quantum recoil; this term is neglected in all discussions of which we are aware. However, this neglect is well justiﬁed
only for ωc ≪ m.

4.2. Transverse modes

The dispersion relations for transverse modes are found by inserting the transverse response function into (10), with
the Jancovici and Lindhard forms given by (2) and (6), respectively. The numerical results are shown in Figure 8 for
pF/m = 0.05, 0.5, 5. In ﬁgures 8(a), for pF/m = 0.05 the Jancovici and Lindhard forms are indistinguishable, and in
(b) for pF/m = 0.5, relativistic eﬀects cause a shift to lower frequencies compared with the nonrelativistic form. In
ﬁgure 8(c) for pF/m = 5, a peculiar feature is apparent in the Lindhard form at small |k|; the Lindhard form is close
to the Jancovici form at higher frequencies but jumps rather abruptly to a cutoﬀ at the plasma frequency due to this
peculiar feature. The dispersion curve, ω2 = ω2

, for a cold plasma is included for comparison.

p + |k|

Our numerical results extend the known dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in a degenerate electron gas into
the relativistic regime, and allow us to compare exact and approximate expressions for the dispersion relation for
transverse waves in a completely degenerate relativistic electron gas. We comment here on the signiﬁcance of these
results.

5. DISCUSSION

5.1. Dispersion curves

The dispersion curve for longitudinal waves is known to have a tongue-like feature oriented along ω ≈ |k|vF [4],
where the Fermi speed, vF, is related to the Fermi momentum by vF = pF/m in the nonrelativistic case. We plot
the generalization to the relativistic case, which also gives a tongue-like feature oriented along ω ≈ |k|vF, but with
vF = pF/εF, with εF = (m2 + p2
F)1/2 the Fermi energy. The main changes from the nonrelativistic case are (a) this
relativistically correct interpretation of vF, (b) the decrease of the cutoﬀ frequency, and (c) a sharpening of the peak
in the dispersion curve where it turns over. These features are illustrated in Figure 7 where exact dispersion curves
are compared with their nonrelativistic counterparts.

The form of the dispersion curve for transverse waves in any isotropic plasma is severely constrained by the
requirements that the frequency be equal to the cutoﬀ frequency for |k| = 0 and asymptote to the light line, ω = |k|,
for |k| → ∞. We compare the dispersion relations for transverse waves derived using Jancovici’s and Lindhard’s
transverse response functions, and ﬁnd there to be an apparently spurious feature in the latter. A test on the
validity of the transverse response function is that it gives the correct result for the magnetic susceptibility of an
electron gas, which is known to have the same ratio of contributions from Pauli spin paramagnetism and Landau
orbital diamagnetism in the relativistic case as in the familiar nonrelativistic case [19]. Jancovici’s transverse response
function reproduces this results but Lindhard’s does not. This failure may be attributed to the somewhat artiﬁcial
procedure for including the spin of the electron in Lindhard’s calculation; this was recognized by Lindhard himself in
that his transverse response function fails to reproduce the correct value for the magnetic susceptibility of an electron
gas. This peculiar feature in the dispersion curve for the Lindhard form is non-physical, and is due to an incorrect
treatment of the electron spin.

5.2. PC for transverse waves in superdense plasmas

The properties of waves, especially transverse waves, in a superdense plasma has led to some controversy. Our

results help clarify one aspect of this controversy, but there are two other aspects of it that we have not resolved.

A controversial point is whether PC is possible for waves in a superdense plasma. Early authors [7, 17] assumed that
the cutoﬀ frequency could exceed the threshold for PC, ωc > 2m, and that there is then a portion of the dispersion
curve just above the cutoﬀ frequency in the region where PC is allowed. These discussions were for an arbitrary
electrons gas, and were not restricted to the completely degenerate case. In Ref. [10] it was pointed out that PC has
important implications for the plasma process for neutrino emission from dense plasmas. However, the claim that
PC is allowed was declared to be untrue in Ref. [23]. In Ref. [11] it was pointed out that for a completely degenerate
electron gas, the PC threshold is εF + m, rather than 2m, because the only available electron states are above εF. It
was further argued that the cutoﬀ frequency (which was approximated by the proper plasma frequency in Ref. [11])
can never exceed the threshold frequency for PC. Our results imply existence of a DF region in Figure 1 in the range
2m < ω < m + εF, which conﬁrms the point made in Ref. [11], but only for |k| = 0. As is evident from Figure 1,
and as we point out elsewhere [24], this region shrinks with increasing |k| and is absent for |k| > 2pF. We conclude
that in superdense plasmas, deﬁned to satisfy ωc > 2m, although the dispersion curve has its cutoﬀ in the DF region
2m < ω < m + εF, the dispersion curve enters the region where PC is allowed at a higher |k|. Hence, at suﬃciently
high ω, a photon (in a completely degenerate electron gas) can decay into a pair and a pair can annihilate into a
single photon. In Figure 9 we plot the diﬀerence between the dispersion curve and the boundary of the DF region to
illustrate this eﬀect for a particular value of pF.

Our results lead us to conclude that PC is possible in a superdense plasma, but this conclusion is subject to two
important provisos. The ﬁrst proviso is that we neglect mass renormalization. The modiﬁcation of the mass of the
electron was central to the original argument in Ref. [23], but has been ignored in most subsequent discussions. More-
over, the form of the mass renormalization needs further investigation: in existing treatments the photon propagator
is taken to be that in vacuo, whereas the photon propagator in the plasma should be used. The other proviso concerns
the evaluation of the cutoﬀ frequency. The cutoﬀ frequency is determined by (11) and in all existing discussions, the
term ω2
c ≪ m2, and this is not necessarily
satisﬁed in a superdense plasma. For example, in Ref. [12] the semi-classical forms (7) and (8) were used to treat the
dispersion, and while this is valid for transverse waves well above the cutoﬀ frequency, it is not valid in a superdense
plasma near the cutoﬀ frequency, because the −ω2
c on the right hand side of (11) is due to the quantum recoil term
that is neglected in the semi-classical approximation.

c in the denominator of the integrand is neglected. This is only justiﬁed for ω2

In a more general discussion of wave dispersion in a superdense plasma one needs to include both the mass renor-
malization and the (relativistically correct) quantum recoil in a self-consistent manner. This involves a major gen-
eralization of existing theory that we do not attempt here. The question as to whether or not PC is allowed in a
superdense plasma should remain open until such a general treatment is available.

5.3. Pair modes

Inclusion of an additional source of dispersion in a plasma usually leads to the appearance of intrinsically new
wave modes associated with that dispersion, and pair modes are associated with dispersion due to PC. Pair modes are
known to exist in degenerate Bose gases [6, 22], and in a magnetized completely degenerate electron gas [21]. Although
we searched for pair mode solutions we found none in an isotropic degenerate electron gas. In a degenerate Bose gas,
the Bose condensate contributes a pole in the dispersion function, and the existence of pair modes results directly
from the presence of the pole. In a magnetized completely degenerate electron gas, there is a logarithmic singularity
in the response functions associated with the threshold for PC, and the existence of pair modes is attributed to this
feature [21]. Our plots of the response functions for an unmagnetized completely degenerate electron gas show no
singular feature associated with the threshold for PC, cf. Figures 4 and 5. Our failure to ﬁnd solutions corresponding
to pair modes is consistent with the suggestion in Ref. [21] that they are associated with singularities in (the real
parts of) the response functions at the threshold for PC.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We compare the response functions for a completely degenerate electron gas in three forms: the fully relativistic
form due to Jancovici [5], the nonrelativistic form due to Lindhard [3], and the semi-classical approximation in which
the quantum recoil is neglected. An important physical diﬀerence between the Jancovici and Lindhard (and semi-
classical) forms is the existence in the relativistic case of one-photon pair creation (PC) as a dissipation mechanism,

7

in addition to Landau damping (LD). This leads to a PC-associated dispersion that is intrinsic to the relativistic
quantum case. We plot the response functions and ﬁnd that they vary smoothly as the thresholds for LD and PC
are crossed. The semi-classical approximation, cf. (7) and (8), is found to be accurate for |k| ≪ 2pF, but not for
|k| ≫ 2pF (except for ω/|k| → 1).

We plot dispersion curves for longitudinal and transverse waves. The relativistic treatment leads to a natural
generalization of a known result in the nonrelativistic case [4]: the dispersion curve for longitudinal waves has a
tongue-like appearance, with the Langmuir-like branch roughly along ω = |k|vF, turning over at a maximum frequency
and joining onto the zero-sound branch. The main relativistic eﬀects are that the Fermi speed is replaced by its
relativistically correct value, vF = pF/εF, and the cutoﬀ frequency by its relativistically correct value (11). Both the
longitudinal and transverse modes cutoﬀ at the same frequency, which is close to but not equal to the proper plasma
frequency, with the proviso that this is well below the threshold for PC. For transverse waves, comparison of the
Jancovici and Lindhard forms shows that they are similar except for a nonphysical feature in the Lindhard case near
the cutoﬀ frequency for high pF, where the dispersion curve jumps from near the relativistically correct cutoﬀ to the
nonrelativistic cutoﬀ. This feature appears to be associated with an intrinsic weakness in the Lindhard form, which
does not treat the spin correctly and does not reproduce the well-known form for the magnetic susceptibility.

We comment on a controversy concerning whether or not PC is possible in a superdense plasma, where the plasma
frequency exceeds the threshold for PC. Contrary to earlier claims [7, 10, 17] that PC is possible, it was argued in
Refs [11, 12, 23] that it is not possible. Our results show that the dispersion curves do enter the region where PC is
allowed, and we point out deﬁciencies in the arguments to the contrary. However, the conclusion that PC is possible in
a superdense plasma is subject to two important provisos: mass renormalization is neglected, and the cutoﬀ frequency
is approximated by neglecting the term ωc2 in the denominator on the right hand side of (11). In any more detailed
investigation of dispersion in a superdense plasma, both these eﬀects should be taken into account simultaneously.

We searched for pair modes, known to exist in degenerate Bose gases [6, 22] and a degenerate magnetized electron
gas [21]. We found no evidence for pair modes in an isotropic degenerate electron gas. Pair modes in a degenerate
Bose gas are associated with the contribution to the response from the Bose condensate, which gives a pole in the
response functions; pair modes in a magnetized degenerate electron gas are associated with a logarithmic singularity
at the threshold for PC [21]. There is no such singularity in the response functions for an isotropic electron gas.

FIG. 1: The regions where dissipation is allowed in a degenerate electron gas with pF/m = 0.5 are shown shaded. The unshaded
areas represent the DF regions. LD is allowed only to the right of the light line (small dashed) and is further restricted to the
shaded area by the Pauli exclusion principle. PC is allowed only to the left of the curve ω = (4m2 + |k|
)1/2, where dissipation
in the vacuum is allowed (darkest shading) and this is completely suppressed by the electron gas in the unshaded area indicated.
The vertical lines indicate the two values of |k|/m = 0.1, 2 chosen to plot the response function.

FIG. 2: Re µ0P L(k) is shown as a function of ω for |k| = 0.1m, separated into two parts: (a) the LD regime (ω < |k|) where
dissipation occurs in the shaded regions and is due to the degenerate electron gas, and (b) the PC regime (ω > (4m2 + |k|2)1/2)
where PC due to the degenerate gas completely suppresses the vacuum PC below the short dashed line, partially suppresses
the vacuum PC between the two dashed lines, and makes no contribution to the vacuum PC above the long dashed line.

10

FIG. 3: Re µ0P L(k) is shown as a function of ω for |k| = 2m, separated into two parts: (a) the regime ω < |k|, with LD is
nonzero only between the two dashed lines, and (b) the regime ω > (4m2 + |k|2)1/2, with PC due to the degenerate gas nonzero
only between the two dashed lines.

FIG. 4: A plot of log |Re µ0P L(k)/m2| for pF/m = 0.5 and |k|/m = 0.1. (a) The overall form of the response function; the
cusps correspond to points where Re µ0P L(k) passes through zero. (b) The LD region in more detail. (c) The PC region in
more detail. The vertical lines deﬁne the diﬀerent regions in the LD and PC regimes (see text).

FIG. 7: The longitudinal dispersion relation for the Jancovici (solid) form and Lindhard (small dashed) form for increasing
values of pF/m. (a) For pF/m = 0.05, the Jancovici and Lindhard forms are indistinguishable. (b) For pF/m = 0.5, the
Jancovici and Lindhard forms are aligned along ω = |k|vF with vF = pF/εF (solid straight line) and vF = pF/m (long dashed
line), respectively. (c) For pF/m = 5, the cutoﬀ frequency for the Jancovici form (solid curve) is obviously much lower than for
the Lindhard form (long dashed curve); these are given by ωc, cf. (11), and ωp, respectively.

FIG. 8: The dispersion relations for the transverse mode for the Jancovici (solid) and Lindhard (small dashed) forms for
increasing values of pF/m. (a) For pF/m = 0.05: the Jancovici and Lindhard are indistinguishable. (b) For pF/m = 0.5,
relativistic lowering of the dispersion curve is apparent, but the shape is essentially unchanged. (c) For pF/m = 5, with the
cold plasma dispersion curve (long dashed) included for comparison: the Lindhard form jumps from the cold-plasma form to
close to the Jancovici form for small |k|. In all cases, the dispersion curve asymptotes to the light line at large |k|.

FIG. 9: A plot showing the diﬀerence, εF − εpF−|k| − ωT (k), between the boundary curve of the region where PC is allowed
and the dispersion curve for the Jancovici transverse mode for pF/m = 40. The cutoﬀ frequency is above the threshold, 2m, for
PC in vacuo, but in a region where PC in the vacuum is completely suppressed by the electron. At |k|/m = 47.7 the diﬀerence
becomes negative and the dispersion curve mode is in a region where PC is possible. At |k|/m = 247.9 the dispersion curve
enters a region where PC has its full vacuum value.

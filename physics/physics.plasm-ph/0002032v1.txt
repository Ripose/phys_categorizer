Abstract

An analysis of single-electron orbits in combined coaxial wiggler and axial

guide magnetic ﬁelds is presented. Solutions of the equations of motion are

developed in a form convenient for computing orbital velocity components and

trajectories in the radially dependent wiggler. Simple analytical solutions are

obtained in the radially-uniform-wiggler approximation and a formula for the

derivative of the axial velocity vk with respect to Lorentz factor γ is derived.

Results of numerical computations are presented and the characteristics of the

equilibrium orbits are discussed. The third spatial harmonic of the coaxial

wiggler ﬁeld gives rise to group III orbits which are characterized by a strong

negative mass regime.

I. INTRODUCTION

Most free-electron lasers employ a wiggler with either a helically symmetric magnetic

ﬁeld generated by biﬁlar current windings or a linearly symmetric magnetic ﬁeld generated

by alternating stacks of permanent magnets. A uniform static guide magnetic ﬁeld is also

frequently employed. Single-particle orbits in these helical and planar ﬁelds combined with

an axial guide ﬁeld have been analyzed in detail and have played a role in the development of

free-electron lasers [1]. Harmonics of gyroresonance for oﬀ-axis electrons caused by the radial

variation of the magnetic ﬁeld of a helical wiggler is found by Chu and Lin [2]. Recently the

feasibility of using a coaxial wiggler in a free-electron laser has been investigated. Freund

et al. [3,4] studied the performance of a coaxial hybrid iron wiggler consisting of a central

rod and a coaxial ring of alternating ferrite and dielectric spacers inserted in a uniform static

axial magnetic ﬁeld. McDermott et al. [5] proposed the use of a wiggler consisting of a coaxial

periodic permanent magnet and transmission line. Coaxial devices oﬀer the possibility of

generating higher power than conventional free-electron lasers and with a reduction in the

beam energy required to generate radiation of a given wavelength.

In the present paper, single-particle orbits in a coaxial wiggler are studied. The wiggler

magnetic ﬁeld is radially dependent with the fundamental plus the third spatial harmonic

component and a uniform static axial magnetic ﬁeld present. In Sec. II the scalar equations

of motion are introduced and reduced to a form which is correct to ﬁrst order in the wiggler

ﬁeld. In Sec. III solutions of the equations of motion are developed in a form suitable for

computing the electron orbital velocity and trajectory in the radially dependent magnetic

ﬁeld of a coaxial wiggler. The special case of a radially independent wiggler is also analyzed.

In Sec. IV the results of numerical computations of the wiggler ﬁeld components, velocity

components, radial excursions, and the Φ function for locating negative mass regimes are

presented and discussed. In Sec. V some conclusions are presented.

III. ORBITAL ANALYSIS

A. Radially dependent wiggler

The scalar equations of motion may be solved to determine the electron orbital velocity

and trajectory in a coaxial wiggler. Equation (13) yields

vz = vk

(19)

where the constant vk is the root-mean-square axial velocity component. With the initial

axial position taken to be z0 = 0,

z = vkt.

(20)

Equations (11), (12), (14), and (20) may be combined to obtain

d2vr

0vr = f (t)

where

f (t) = Ω0Ωwvk[Fr1sin(kwvkt) + Fr3sin(3kwvkt)].

(21)

(22)

By the method of variation of parameters, a solution of Eq. (21) may be obtained in the

form

vr = [−vθ0 + Ω−1

+[vr0 − Ω−1

0 Z t

f (τ )sin(Ω0τ ) dτ ]cos(Ω0t)

(23)

where vr0 and vθ0 are initial radial and azimuthal velocity components. Then Eq. (11) yields

(24)

The orbital velocity is given to ﬁrst order in Bw by Eqs. (23), (24), and (19). The trajectory

may then be computed using

r = r0 + Z t
θ = θ0 + Z t

and Eq. (20).

B. Radially uniform wiggler

By neglecting the radial variation of Fr1 and Fr3, a solution of Eq. (21) may be obtained

in the form

where

vr = α1sin(kwvkt) + α3sin(3kwvkt),

(27)

5

αn =

(n = 1, 3).

Equation (11) then yields

vθ = −Ω−1

0 kwvkα1cos(kwvkt) − Ω−1

The corresponding initial conditions are

vr0 = 0,

(28)

(30)

(31)

Root-mean-square values of the velocity components may be determined by use of Eqs.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A numerical computation is conducted to investigate the properties of the equilibrium

orbits of electrons inside a coaxial wiggler. Wiggler wavelength 2π/kw and lab-frame electron

density n0 were taken to be 3 cm and 1012 cm−3, respectively. The wiggler magnetic ﬁeld Bw

was taken to be 3745 G which corresponds to the relativistic wiggler frequency Ωw/ckw =

6

0.442. Electron-beam energy (γ−1)m0c2 was taken to be 700 keV, corresponding to a Lorentz

factor γ = 2.37. The axial magnetic ﬁeld B0 was varied from 0 to 25.3 kG, corresponding to

a variation from 0 to 3 in the normalized relativistic cyclotron frequency Ω0/ckw associated

with B0. The inner and outer radii of the coaxial wiggler were assumed to be Rin = 1.5 cm

and Rout = 3 cm, respectively.

Figure 1 shows the variation of the axial velocity of the quasi-steady-state orbits with

the axial guide magnetic ﬁeld for three classes of solutions. Group I orbits for which 0 <

Ω0 < kwvk, group II orbits with kwvk < Ω0 < 3kwvk, and group III orbits with Ω0 >

3kwvk. Existence of group III orbits is due to the presence of the third spatial harmonic of

the wiggler ﬁeld, which also produces the second magnetoresonance at Ω0 ≈ 3kwvk. The

narrow width of the second resonance at Ω0/ckw ≈ 2.7 compared to the width of the ﬁrst

magnetoresonance at Ω0 ≈ kwvk is illustrated in Fig. 1B. This is due to the relatively weak

third harmonic compared to the fundamental component of the wiggler ﬁeld. It should be

noted that although the exact resonances Ω0 = kwvk and Ω0 = 3kwvk occur at the origin

where vk/c = Ω0/ckw = 0, the ﬁrst ”magnetoresonance” in the literature refers to the group

II orbits with the cyclotron frequencies around Ω0/ckw ≈ 1 in Fig. 1. Similarly we refer

to the group III orbits with the cyclotron frequency around Ω0/ckw ≈ 2.7 as the second

magnetoresonance.

The rate of change of the electron axial velocity with electron energy is proportional to Φ

and is equal to unity in the absence of the wiggler ﬁeld. Figure 2 illustrates the dependence

of Φ on the radial wiggler magnetic ﬁeld and the axial guide magnetic ﬁeld B0. The curves

corresponding to the group I and II orbits are almost unaﬀected by the third harmonic and

are almost the same as in Ref. [6] where the third harmonic is neglected. A negative mass

regime (i.e., negative Φ for which a decrease in the axial velocity results in an increase in

the electron energy) is found for group III orbits which is stronger than that of the group II

orbits.

Equations (15)-(18) are used to calculate the radial components of the wiggler ﬁeld Fr1

and Fr3. For the axial component the following expressions are used [4]

7

Fz = Fz1 cos(kwz) + Fz3 cos(3kwz),

Fzn = G−1

n [SnI0(nkwr) − TnK0(nkwr)].

(35)

(36)

Figure 3 shows the variation of the amplitudes of the wiggler magnetic ﬁeld (divided by

Bw = 3745 G) with radius, for the ﬁrst and third spatial harmonics. For the ﬁrst harmonic

the radial component, Fr1, has a minimum at r ≈ 2.28 cm and the axial component, Fz1,

changes sign around this point. Mc Dermott et al . [5] have demonstrated the stability of

a thin annular electron beam when Fr1 is minimum at the beam radius. The radial and

axial components of the third harmonic of the wiggler Fr3 and Fz3 are also shown in Fig. 3.

Magnitudes of Fr3 and Fz3 both are minimum at r ≈ 2.28 cm where Fr1 is minimum. This

is actually an inﬂection point for Fz3.

Variations of the radial components of the ﬁrst and third spatial harmonics of the nor-

malized wiggler magnetic ﬁeld Fr1 and Fr3 with the wiggler wave number kw are shown in

Fig. 4. Figure 4 also shows the dimensionless transverse velocity coeﬃcients ¯α1 = α1/c and

¯α3 = α3/c for the initial orbit radius r0 ≈ 2.28 cm where Fr1 is minimum. The cyclotron

frequency Ω0/ckw ≈ 2.7 is taken at the second magnetoresonance, and our choice of 3 cm

for the wiggler wavelength corresponds to kw ≈ 2.1 cm−1. It can be observed that at this

wave number although the radial component of the wiggler ﬁeld at the ﬁrst harmonic Fr1

is much larger than the third harmonic Fr3, the transverse velocity coeﬃcients of the third

harmonic ¯α3 are larger than ¯α1. This shows that the third harmonic may have considerable

eﬀects around the second magnetoresonance at Ω0 ≈ 3kwvk. Away from this resonance Eq.

(28) shows that α3 will be of the order of Fr3.

In order to study the transverse motion of electrons in the radially dependent wiggler

ﬁeld Eqs. (11), (12), (25), and (26) are solved numerically with the initial conditions chosen

so that, in the limit of zero wiggler ﬁeld, there is axial motion at constant velocity vk but

no Larmor motion. Figure 5 shows the variation of the radial and azimuthal components of

electron velocity with z (= vkt). The normalized cyclotron frequency Ω0/ckw is chosen to be

0.5, 1.2, and 3 for group I, II, and III orbits, respectively, which are somewhat away from the

8

magnetoresonances. Solid curves correspond to the initial orbit radius r0 = 2.28 cm, which

is at the point where Fr1 is minimum. Broken curves correspond to r0 = 1.8 cm, which is

away from the Fr1 minimum. It can be observed that the spatial periodicity of vr and vθ for

the ﬁrst two groups is equal to one wiggler wavelength, which is the same as that of the ﬁrst

harmonic. Although group III orbits have a clear sinusoidal shape at r0 = 2.28 cm (solid

curves), the slight deviations from sinusoidal shape are obvious at r0 = 1.8 cm (broken

curves). This is because that at r0 = 2.28 cm where Fr1 is minimum Fr3 is very small.

Therefore away from the resonance the third harmonic plays almost no role, at r0 = 2.28

cm. Moving away from Fr1 minimum to r0 = 1.8 cm, however, increases the magnitude of

Fr3 slightly making the eﬀect of the third harmonic noticeable on group III orbits, which

are away from the second magnetoresonance, in Fig. 5.

Figure 6 shows the variations of vr/c and vθ/c with z (= vkt) for group III orbits when the

cyclotron frequency is adjusted at the second magnetoresonance at Ω0/ckw ≈ 2.7. At r0 =

2.28 cm the periodicity is approximately equal to λw/3, which is the same as that of the third

harmonic, and shows the strong inﬂuence of the third harmonic on the transverse velocity

components. Going away from the Fr1 minimum to r0 = 1.8 cm makes the amplitudes of

oscillations of vr and vθ larger. Broken curves correspond to the solutions of Eqs. (27) and

(29) when the radial variation of the wiggler ﬁeld is neglected. These solutions do not diﬀer

appreciably from the r-dependent solutions for r0 = 2.28 cm because at Fr1 minimum the

radial excursions are small for group III orbits. Away from the Fr1 minimum at r0 = 1.8

cm, however, deviations are noticeable due to the larger radial excursions.

Figure 7 shows vr/c versus z for group II orbits for r-dependent wiggler (broken curves)

and r-independent wiggler (solid curves). The initial orbit radius is taken at r0 = 2.28 cm

and the cyclotron frequency is chosen around the ﬁrst magnetoresonance at Ω0/ckw = 0.9.

Large radial excursions of electrons for group II orbits make the transverse velocity strongly

aﬀected by the radial dependency of the wiggler ﬁeld. The amplitude is also modulated in

space with the wavelength of around 16λw = 48 cm.

The radial excursion r shown in Fig. 8 corresponds to the cyclotron frequencies away

9

from the magnetoresonances at Ω0/ckw equal to 0.5, 1.2, and 3 for the group I, II, and III

orbits, respectively. Solid curves correspond to the r0 = 2.28 cm and the broken curves

correspond to r0 = 1.8 cm. It can be noticed that when the electrons are injected into the

wiggler at r0 = 2.28 cm, where Fr1 is minimum, electron orbits remain well away from the

waveguide walls at Rin = 1.5 cm and Rout = 3 cm.

Figure 9 compares the radial excursions of group III orbits at the second magnetores-

onance at Ω0/ckw = 2.7, (solid curve) with those slightly away from the resonance at

Ω0/ckw = 3, (broken curve). Inﬂuence of the third harmonic can be clearly seen through

the modulation of the third harmonic by the ﬁrst harmonic when the cyclotron frequency is

adjusted at the second magnetoresonance.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The third spatial harmonic of the coaxial wiggler ﬁeld gives rise to the group III orbits

with Ω0 > 3kwvk. This relatively weak third harmonic makes the width of the second

magnetoresonance narrow compared to the ﬁrst magnetoresonance. A strong negative mass

regime is found for the group III orbits. By adjusting the cyclotron frequency at the second

magnetoresonance the wiggler induced velocity of the group III orbits was found to increase

considerably. When the electrons are injected into the wiggler where its magnetic ﬁeld is

minimum the electron orbits remain well away from the waveguide boundaries.

Harmonic gyroresonance of electrons in the combined helical wiggler and axial guide

magnetic ﬁeld is reported by Chu and Lin [2]. In their analysis the relativistic single particle

equation of motion is used with the axial velocity as well as the axial magnetic ﬁeld of

the wiggler averaged along the axial direction. By assuming near steady-state orbits for

oﬀ-axis electrons they found that the radial variation of the wiggler magnetic ﬁeld produces

a harmonic structure in the transverse force. This force, in turn, comprises oscillations at

all harmonics of kwz. It should be noted that there is no harmonic structure in the helical

wiggler itself and the higher velocity harmonics vanish for the exact steady-state orbits of

10

the on-axis electrons. Moreover, higher harmonics do not appear in the one dimensional

helical wiggler where the radial variation is neglected.

In the present analysis of coaxial wiggler, on the other hand, equation of motion is

written to ﬁrst order in the wiggler amplitude. With this approximation axial component of

the wiggler ﬁeld has no contribution to the problem leaving the axial velocity as a constant.

Magnetic ﬁeld of a coaxial wiggler is composed of a fundamental plus a large number of odd

spatial harmonics, which directly appear in the magnetic force represented by f (t) in Eq.

(22). Third harmonic in f (t) appears in the transverse velocity components as a part of

the integrands in Eqs. (23) and (24) and is also demonstrated numerically for the radially

dependent coaxial wiggler, but for the radially uniform wiggler the third harmonic is explicit

in the solutions Eqs. (27)-(29).

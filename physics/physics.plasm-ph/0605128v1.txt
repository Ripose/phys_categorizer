(Received 16 March 2005)

We investigate the nonlinear interaction between two laser beams in a plasma in the

weakly nonlinear and relativistic regime. The evolution of the laser beams is governed by

two nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations that are coupled with the slow plasma density response.

We study the growth rates of the Raman forward and backward scattering instabilities as

well of the Brillouin and self-focusing/modulational instabilities. The nonlinear evolution of

the instabilities is investigated by means of direct simulations of the time-dependent system

of nonlinear equations.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction between intense laser beams and plasmas leads to a variety of diﬀerent insta-

bilities, including Brillouin and Raman forward and backward [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] scattering and

modulational instabilities. In multiple dimensions we also have ﬁlamentation and side-scattering

instabilities. Relativistic eﬀects can then play an important role [1, 6, 7]. When two laser beams

interact in the plasma, we have a new set of phenomena. An interesting application is the beat-

wave accelerator, in which two crossing beams with somewhat diﬀerent frequencies can accelerate

electrons to ultra-relativistic speeds via the ponderomotive force acting on the electrons. The

modulational and ﬁlamentation instabilities of multiple co-propagating electromagnetic waves can

be described by a system of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations from which the nonlinear

wave coupling and the interaction between localized light wave packets can be easily studied [8, 9].

Two co-propagating narrow laser beams may attract each other and spiral around each other [10]

or merge [11]. Counter-propagating laser beams detuned by twice the plasma frequency can, at

relativistic intensities, give rise to fast plasma waves via higher-order nonlinearities [12, 13, 14]. At

relativistic amplitudes, plasma waves can also be excited via beat wave excitation at frequencies

diﬀerent from the electron plasma frequency, with applications to eﬃcient wake-ﬁeld accelerators

[15]. The relativistic wakeﬁeld behind intense laser pulses is periodic in one-dimension [16] and

shows a quasi-periodic behavior in multi-dimensional simulations [17]. Particle-in-cell simulations

have demonstrated the generation of large-amplitude plasma wake-ﬁelds by colliding laser pulses

[18] or by two co-propagating pulses where a long trailing pulse is modulated eﬃciently by the

periodic plasma wake behind the ﬁrst short pulse [19].

In the present paper, we consider the nonlinear interaction between two weakly relativistic

crossing laser beams in plasmas. We derive a set of nonlinear mode coupled equations and nonlinear

dispersion relations, which we analyze for Raman backward and forward scattering instabilities as

well as for Brillouin and modulation/self-focusing instabilities.

II. NONLINEAR MODEL EQUATIONS

We consider the propagation of intense laser light in an electron–ion plasma. The slowly varying

electron density perturbation is denoted by nes1. Thus, our starting point is the Maxwell equation

The laser ﬁeld is given in the radiation gauge, ~B = ∇ × ~A and ~E = −(1/c)∂ ~A/∂t. Since ∂~pe/∂t =
−e ~E, we thus have ~pe = e ~A/c. Moreover, ~pe = meγ~ve, where me is the electron rest mass and
γ = (1 − v2

e /c2)−1/2 is the relativistic gamma factor, so that

In order to close (6), we next consider the slow plasma response. Here we may follow two

routes. First, if we assume immobile ions, the slowly varying electron number density and velocity

perturbations satisfy the equations

with (15) (Case II: Brillouin scattering).

The expressions (16) and (17) derived above provide the slow plasma response for any given
pair of ﬁelds { ~Aj } (j = 1, 2). The latter now obey a set of coupled equations, which are obtained

by substituting (16) into (6),

the expressions (20a) and (20b) may be either positive or negative, depending on the frequency Ω,

prescribing either the modulational instability or the Raman and Brillouin scattering instabilities

The two nonlinear wave equations are identical upon an index (1, 2) interchange, and coincide

for equal frequencies ω1 = ω2.

B. Nonlinear dispersion relation

We now investigate the parametric instabilities of the system of equations (19a) and (19b).
Fourier decomposing the system by the ansatz ~Aj = [ ~Aj0 + ~Aj+ exp(i ~K · ~r − iΩt) + ~Aj− exp(−i ~K ·
~r + iΩt))] exp(−iΩ0t), where | ~Aj0| ≫ | ~Aj±|, and sorting for diﬀerent powers of exp(i ~K · ~r − iΩt),

we ﬁnd the nonlinear frequency shift

where QK=0 denotes the expression for Q with K = 0. For the nonlinear wave couplings, we have

from (19) the system of equations

D1+X1+ + Q|A10|2(X1+ + X1+ + X2+ + X2−) = 0,

D1−X1− + Q|A10|2(X1+ + X1+ + X2+ + X2−) = 0,

D2+X2+ + Q|A20|2(X1+ + X1+ + X2+ + X2−) = 0,

D1−X1− + Q|A20|2(X1+ + X1+ + X2+ + X2−) = 0,

where the unknowns are X1+ = ~A∗

10 · ~A1+, X1− = ~A10 · ~A∗

1−, X2+ = ~A∗

20 · ~A2+, and X2− = ~A20 · ~A∗

2−.

The sidebands are characterized by

Dj± = ±2[ωjΩ − c2~kj · ~K] − c2K 2,

where we have used ~vgj = c~kj/ωj. The solution of the system of equations (22) yields the nonlinear

which relates the complex-valued frequency Ω to the wavenumber ~K. Equation (24) covers Raman

forward and backscattering instabilities, as well as the Brillouin backscattering instability or the

modulational/self-focusing instability, depending on the two expressions for the coupling constant
Q. If either | ~A10| or | ~A20| is zero, then we recover the usual expressions for a single laser beam in

a laboratory plasma, or for a high-frequency radio beam in the ionosphere [21].

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We have solved the nonlinear dispersion relation (24) and presented the numerical results in Figs.

1–5. In all cases, we have used the normalized weakly relativistic pump wave amplitudes Aj0 = 0.1

with diﬀerent sets of wavenumbers for the two beams. The nonlinear couplings between the laser

beams and the Langmuir waves, giving rise to the Raman scattering instabilities (Case I), are

considered in Figs. 1 and 2. The instability essentially obeys the matching conditions ωj = ωs + Ω
and ~kj = ~ks + ~K, where ωj and ~kj are the frequency and wavenumbers of the pump wave, ωs and ~ks

are the frequency and wavenumbers for the scattered and frequency downshifted electromagnetic

daughter wave, Ω and K are the frequencies of the Langmuir waves, and where the light waves

approximately obey the linear dispersion relation, ωj = (ω2

have the matching condition (ω2

T e)1/2, which
in two-dimensions relates the components Ky and Kz of the Langmuir waves to each other, and

p0 + (~kj − ~K)2c2]1/2 + (ω2

j c2)1/2 = [ω2

p0 + 3K 2v2

p0 + k2

which gives rise to almost circular regions of instability, as seen in Figs. 1 and 2. In the upper left

and right panels of Fig. 1, we have assumed that the single beams A1 and A2 propagate in the

y and z direction, respectively, having the wavenumber (k1y, k1z) = (6, 0) and (k2y, k2z) = (0, 4),

respectively. We can clearly see a backward Raman instability, which for the beams A1 and A2

have maximum growth rates at (Ky, Kz) = (2k1y, 0) = (12, 0) ωp0/c and (Ky, Kz) = (0, 2k2z) =

(0, 8) ωp0/c, respectively. The backward Raman instability is connected via the obliquely growing

wave modes to the forward Raman scattering instability that has a maximum growth rate (much

smaller than that of the backward Raman scattering instability) at the wave number K ≈ ωpe/c in

the same directions as the laser beams. In the lower panels, we consider the two beams propagating

simultaneously in the plasma, at a right angle to each other (lower left panel) and in opposite

directions (lower right panel). We see that the dispersion relation predicts a rather weak interaction

between the two laser beams, where the lower left panel shows more or less a superposition of the

growth rates in the two upper panels. The case of two counter-propagating laser beams (lower right

panel) also shows a weak interaction between the two beams. For the case of equal wavelengths of

the two pump waves, as shown in Fig. 2, we have a similar scenario as in Fig. 1. The lower left

panel of Fig. 2 shows that the growth rate of two interacting laser beams propagating at a right

angle to each other is almost a superposition of the growth rates of the single laser beams displayed

in the upper panels of Fig. 2. Only for the counter-propagating laser beams in the lower right

panel we see that the instability regions have split into broader and narrower bands of instability,

while the magnitude of the instability is the same as for the single beam cases.

We next turn to the Brillouin scattering scenario (Case II), in which the laser wave is scattered

against ion acoustic waves, displayed in Figs. 3 and 4. In the weakly nonlinear case, we have three-

wave couplings in the same manner as for the interaction with Langmuir waves, and we see in both

Figs. 3 and 4 that the instability has a maximum growth rate in a narrow, almost circular band

in the (Ky, Kz) plane. In the upper two panels, we also see the backscattered Brillouin instability

with a maximum growth rate at approximately twice the pump wavenumbers, but we do not have

the forward scattered instability. Instead, we see a broadband weak instability in all directions and

also perpendicular to the pump wavenumbers. A careful study shows that the perpendicular waves

are purely growing, i.e. there may be density channels created along the propagation direction of

the laser beam. In the lower panels of Figs. 3 and 4, we display the cases with interacting laser

beams. Also in the case of Brillouin scattering, the nonlinear dispersion relation predicts a rather

8

weak interaction between the two beams, where the instability regions of the two beams are more

or less superimposed without dramatic diﬀerences in the growth rates.

In order to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the interacting laser beams in plasmas, we have

carried out numerical simulations of the reduced system of equations (6) in two spatial dimensions,

and have presented the results in Figs. 5–8.

In these simulations, we have used as an initial

condition that either A1 has a constant amplitude of 0.1 and A2 has a zero amplitude, or that both

beams have a constant amplitude of 0.1 and that they initially have group velocities at a right angle
to each other. Due to symmetry reasons, it is suﬃcient to simulate one vector component of ~Aj,

which we will denote Aj (j = 1, 2). The background plasma density is slightly perturbed with a low-

level noise (random numbers). We ﬁrst consider stimulated Raman scattering, displayed in Figs.

5 and 6. The single beam case in Fig. 5 shows a growth of density waves mainly in the direction of

the beam, while a standing wave pattern is created in the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave

envelope, where maxima in the laser beam amplitude is (roughly) correlated with minima in the

electron density. This is in line with the standard Raman backscattering instability. The simulation

is ended when the plasma density ﬂuctuations are large and self-nonlinearities and kinetic eﬀects

are likely to become important. In Fig. 6, we show the case with the two beams crossing each

other at a right angle.

In this case, the wave pattern becomes slightly more complicated with

local maxima of the laser beam envelope amplitude correlated with local minima of the electron

density. However, this pattern is very regular and there is no clear sign of nonlinear structures

in the numerical solution. We next turn to the case of stimulated Brillouin scattering, presented

in Figs. 7 and 8. In this case, the waves grow not only in the direction of the laser beam but

also, with almost the same growth rate, obliquely to the propagation direction of the laser beam.

We see in the single beam case, presented in Fig. 7, that the envelope of the ion beam becomes

modulated in localized areas both in y and z directions, and in the nonlinear phase at the end

of the simulation, the laser beam envelope has local maxima correlated with local minima of the

ion density. For the case of two crossed laser beams, displayed in Fig. 8, we see a more irregular

structure of the instability and that at the ﬁnal stage, local “hot spots” are created in which large

amplitude laser beam envelopes are correlated with local depletions of the ion density.

V. SUMMARY

In summary, we have investigated the instability and dynamics of two nonlinearly interact-

ing intense laser beams in an unmagnetized plasma. Our analytical and numerical results reveal

9

that stimulated Raman forward and backward scattering instabilities are the dominating nonlinear

processes that determine the stability of intense laser beams in plasmas, where relativistic mass

increases and the radiation pressure eﬀects play a dominant role. Our nonlinear dispersion relation

for two interacting laser beams with diﬀerent wavenumbers predicts a superposition of the instabil-

ities for the single beams. The numerical simulation of the coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations

for the laser beams and the governing equations for the slow plasma density perturbations in the

presence of the radiation pressures, reveal that in the case of stimulated Raman scattering, the

nonlinear interaction between the two beams is weaker than for the case of stimulated Brillouin

scattering. The latter case lead to local density cavities correlated with maxima in the electro-

magnetic wave envelope. The present results should be useful for understanding the nonlinear

propagation of two nonlinearly interacting laser beams in plasmas, as well as for the acceleration of

electrons by high gradient electrostatic ﬁelds that are created due to stimulated Raman scattering

instabilities in laser-plasma interactions.

is (ky, kz) = (0, 4) ωp0/c. In the lower left panel, two beams are launched at a perpendicular angle

to each other, and in the lower right panel, the two beams are counter-propagating. We used the
normalized amplitudes | ~A10| = | ~A20| = 0.1, the ion to electron mass ratio mi/me = 73440 (Argon),
and the ion sound speed cs = 3.4 × 10−5 c.

FIG. 4: The normalized (by ωp0) growth rates due to stimulated Brillouin scattering (Case II)

for single laser beams (upper panels) and for two laser beams (lower panel), as a function of the
wave numbers Ky and Kz. The upper left and right panels show the growth rate for beam ~A1
and ~A2, respectively, where the wavenumber for ~A1 is (ky, kz) = (5, 0) ωp0/c and the one for ~A2 is

(ky, kz) = (0, 5) ωp0/c. In the lower left panel, two beams are launched at a perpendicular angle

to each other, and in the lower right panel, the two beams are counter-propagating. We used the

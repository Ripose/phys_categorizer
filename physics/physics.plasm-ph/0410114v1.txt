Abstract

The possibility to observe vacuum electron-positron pair creation due to a powerful optical laser
pulse is discussed. We employ a quantum kinetic formulation of the problem with a source term
describing the vacuum pair production in a homogeneous electric ﬁeld with arbitrary time dependence
(dynamical Schwinger mechanism). For a periodic ﬁeld weak in comparison with the critical value
Ecr = m2/|e| , the electron-positron plasma density changes approximately periodically with twice
the ﬁeld frequency. Under these conditions, the mean value < n > for the density per period in the
volume λ3 is a more appropriate characteristic quantity than the residual density nr which is taken
over an integer number of ﬁeld periods and calculated using the imaginary time method. The value
< n > is proportional to the squared ﬁeld intensity and does not depend on the frequency. We show
that in terms of the parameter < n > an optical laser can be more eﬀective than a X-ray one. We
expect that it is possible to observe the vacuum creation eﬀect not only by means of the planned
X-ray free electron lasers but already at present-day optical lasers.

INTRODUCTION

QED is considered as the most advanced physical theory, many of its predictions have been proven
experimentally with highest available precision. Nevertheless, some questions are discussed till now, e.g.,
the vacuum pair creation eﬀect by a classical electric ﬁeld [1]. A complete theoretical description of this
eﬀect has been obtained [2, 3, 4, 5], but there is still no experimental proof. The main problem is the
high value of the critical electric ﬁeld strength, necessary to be reached for the pair creation, namely
Ecr = 1.3 × 1016V /cm for electron-positron pairs. According to the Schwinger formula, the pair creation
rate in a constant electric ﬁeld is

and therefore exponentially suppressed when E ≪ Ecr . Fortunately, the situation changes qualitatively
if the ﬁeld acts a ﬁnite time only [2, 6, 7, 8]. In this case, the Schwinger formula as well as its analog for
a monochromatic ﬁeld (Brezin-Itzykson formula [9]) become inapplicable.

There are a few examples for physical situations where the Schwinger eﬀect can be observed, e.g.
relativistic heavy ion collisions [10], neutron stars [11, 12] and focussed laser pulses [13]. The structure
of a real laser ﬁeld is too complicated for the analysis, because the Schwinger eﬀect is non-perturbative
and it requires the exact solution of the dynamical equations. That is why the approximation of the
homogeneous electric ﬁeld is used in most cases. According to diﬀerent estimates [8, 9, 14, 15] the eﬀect
of vacuum creation can not be observed with the presently achieved level of laser power, see also [16].

The recent development of laser technology, in particular the invention of the chirped pulse ampliﬁca-
tion method, has resulted in a huge increase of the light intensity in a laser focal spot [17, 18]. The most
advanced lasers produce pulses with intensities reaching 1022 W/cm 2 and the pulse duration decreasing
down to few oscillation periods. As the construction of X-ray free electron lasers XFELs [19] is now
planned, the possibility of the experimental proof of the Schwinger eﬀect attracts attention again. The
non-stationary eﬀects become important under conditions of short pulses. We use in our work the kinetic
equation approach, which allows us to consider the dynamics of the creation process taking into account
the initial conditions [6]. Compared to the other treatments, the approach within the framework of a
transport equation contains some new dynamical aspects, such as longitudinal momentum dependence of

1

the distribution functions and non-markovian character of the time evolution. It takes into account the
eﬀects of the ﬁeld switching and statistics, as well [20]. This approach has been applied already to the
periodical ﬁeld case [7] with near-critical values of the ﬁeld strength and X-ray frequencies. In particular,
it was shown that there is an ”accumulation” eﬀect when the intensity of the ﬁeld is about half critical:
the average density of pairs grows steadily with the increase of the ﬁeld period numbers.

In the present work, we consider the other region of ﬁeld parameters really achievable nowadays in
the optical lasers: E ≪ Ecr and ν ≪ m , where ν is the laser ﬁeld frequency. We suggest to use in the
criterion for the creation eﬃciency the mean value < n > for the density per period in the volume λ3
is a more appropriate characteristic quantity than the residual density nr . The latter is taken over an
integer number of ﬁeld periods and calculated using the imaginary time method. The main result is that
optical lasers can generate a greater density < n > than X-ray ones.

The work is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the statement of the problem and the necessary
information about the kinetic equation which is used for the description of vacuum pair creation. We
solve this equation numerically for the conditions of the SLAC experiment [21] and study some features of
pair production dynamics. We compare here our results obtained on the non-perturbative basis with the
predictions of another approach [8] and show that optical lasers can be eﬀective generators of electron-
positron pairs during the action of a laser pulse. In Section 3, the low density approximation is considered.
It allows to get some analytical results and to make simple estimates. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss
some possibilities of direct experimental veriﬁcation of pair production by high power optical lasers.

2 THE KINETIC EQUATION APPROACH

In the kinetic approach [6], the basic quantity is the distribution function of electrons in the momentum
representation f (p, t) . The kinetic equation for this function is derived from the Dirac equation in an
external time-dependent ﬁeld by the canonical Bogoliubov transformation method [2], or by the help of the
oscillator representation [22]. This procedure is exact but valid only for the simplest ﬁeld conﬁgurations,
e.g., the homogeneous time dependent electric ﬁeld with the ﬁxed direction

E(t) = (0, 0, E(t)),

E(t) = − ˙A(t) ,

where the vector potential is given in the Hamiltonian gauge Aµ = (0, 0, 0, A(t)) and the overdot denotes
the time derivative. Such a ﬁeld is not appropriate for a quantitative description of the laser pulse, but
can probably be used as qualitative model to estimate results. The corresponding kinetic equation in the
collisionless limit has the form [6]

where v1, v2 are real auxiliary functions. The system (7) is integrated via the Runge-Kutta method with
the initial conditions f (p, t0) = v1(p, t0) = v2(p, t0) = 0 . The momentum dependence of the distribution
function is deﬁned by means of a discretization of the momentum space in a 2-dimensional grid, where
the system (7) is solved in each of its nodes. The concrete grid parameters depend on the ﬁeld strength,
where typical values are ∆p ≈ 0.05 m (grid step) and pmax ≈ (5 − 10) m (grid boundary). The particle
number density can be found after that as a moment of the distribution function

The time dependence of density for the ﬁeld (9) with the parameters Em/Ecr = 4.6 · 10−6 and ν/m =
4.29 · 10−5 , corresponding to SLAC experiments [21] is shown in Fig. 1 in comparison to the planned
X-ray laser [19] with E/Ecr = 0.24 and ν/m = 0.0226 . The pair density oscillates with twice the
frequency of the laser ﬁeld. The density value nr , which is evaluated in the imaginary time method
[8, 15], corresponds to an integer number of ﬁeld periods, nr = n(t = 2π/ν) , and it is negligible in
comparison with the density value nm corresponding to the electric ﬁeld maximum, nm = n(t = π/2ν) .
The mean density per period < n > is of the same order as nm . For the conditions of the SLAC
experiment the ratio of < n > /nr ≈ 3 · 1011 . As a consequence, in spite of the fact that the residual
density for the X-ray laser exceeds the one for the optical laser by a large factor, the situation is diﬀerent
regarding the mean density: the optical laser can produce more pairs per volume lambda cubed than the
X-ray one.

3 LOW DENSITY APPROXIMATION

The low density approximation f ≪ 1 can be used in the weak ﬁeld limit E ≪ Ecr . In that case it is
possible to obtain analytic estimates for the residual ( nr ) and the maximal ( nm ) densities the Eq. (3).

Let us assume additionally that the condition

γ =

|e|Em

≫ 1,

is satisﬁed, where γ is the adiabaticity parameter [8]. This relation can be treated as the condition
for quasi-classical charge transport in an external ﬁeld on the time scale ∼ 1/ν , if only the pairs are
created with vanishing momenta. The latter condition was often used in relation to the longitudinal
momentum [24] but the real momentum distribution of the electron-positron pairs has a width of the
order of the inverse mass for both transverse and longitudinal momenta, see Fig. 2. The momentum
distribution shape varies essentially at the moments of time corresponding to the ﬁeld minima: a complex
quasi-periodic structure with a mean period of about the inverse laser frequency is formed. The mean
period value of such a structure decreases proportionally to the number of ﬁeld periods.

By means of the inequality (12) Eq. (11) is reduced to

The mean density of electron-positron pairs is deﬁned in this case only by the ﬁeld amplitude and does
not depend on the frequency within a wide range of parameters (12). After the integer period number
(when the electric ﬁeld vanishes) the overwhelming part of pairs is absorbed and the residual density,
which is estimated within the usual approach [15], is negligible in comparison with the mean one used
above. For the Terawatt Nd-glass laser with the wavelength 527 nm and the ﬁeld strength Em = 6 · 1010
V/cm [21] we have m/ν ≈ 2 · 105 , so the mean density exceeds the residual one by more than 10 orders
of magnitude. According to Fig. 1, there are ≈ 105 pairs in a volume of wavelength cubed on the average
for one period of the laser ﬁeld. The same pair density can be achieved under the conditions of an X-ray
laser [7]. Let us notice, that the formula from Ref. [9] for the pair creation probability with the condition

in this case. This is not surprising because the

The simplest laser ﬁeld model (9) predicts the existence of a dense electron-positron plasma during a laser
pulse duration, which is absorbed almost completely after switching oﬀ the ﬁeld. The mean density is
deﬁned by the ﬁeld strength and does not depend on frequency. The plasma density reaches 1018 cm −3
within the range of the really achieved ﬁelds 1010 − 1011 V/cm. The usual recipe for an experimental
proof of the Schwinger eﬀect suggests that an increase of the residual plasma density can be achieved
by an increase of both the frequency and the power of the laser radiation, e.g., via XFEL facilities [19].
It is possible that the simpler way is to try to probe the plasma with some external ﬁeld in addition to
the generating one. SLAC experiments [21] can serve as an example of this type, where a high energy
( 46 GeV) electron beam crosses the focus of the 527 nm Terawatt pulsed Nd-glass laser and 106 ± 14
positrons above background have been observed. The observed positrons are interpreted as arising from
a two-step process: laser photons are backscattered to GeV energies by the electron beam and a collision
between the high-energy photon and several laser photons produces an electron-positron pair.

Abstract

Based on the known implicit solution for nonlinear plasma
waves, an explicit solution was obtained in the form of decomposi-
tion into harmonics. The solution obtained exhibits a mechanism
for steepening of nonlinear plasma wave as a result of increasing
contribution of harmonics and may be used in theoretical studies
of processes involving nonlinear plasma waves.

In the present work an explicit solution for one-dimensional nonlinear
plasma waves was obtained. Below, prior to the discussion of the solution
per se, we shall give a formal mathematical description of the method for
obtaining explicit solutions in case when the implicit solutions are known.

1) In many nonlinear problems of physics the solutions are sought in

expressions of the following form

x = f (y),

(1)

where f (y) is some nonlinear function. The variable x may be e.g., the coor-
dinate or the time, while as y the electric ﬁeld or magnetic ﬁeld strengths, the
velocity of the continuum etc. may serve. The expressions of the type (1) are
usually termed as implicitly given with respect to the quantity y. This equa-
tion may describe, for instance, some nonlinear oscillation phenomena, the
results of experimental observations, the distribution of electromagnetic ﬁeld
in a cavity or the time dependence of electric ﬁeld strength in the receiving
aerial. The implicit solutions of the type (1) are usually highly inconve-
nient and the knowledge of an explicit solution of the type y = y (x) is much
preferable. It is frequently required to have an explicit solution in the form of
decomposition into harmonics or of a spectrum (e.g., as a series or the Fourier
integral), a series expansion in some set of functions etc. The method that
is described below will permit the reconstruction from the relation (1) of
explicit representations for some function g(y) (in particular g = y) in the
form of series expansion or an integral.

Let some function q(x) be given. The transform of this function is called

the quantity (see, e.g., [1])

Q(α) = Lx[K+(α, x)q(x)],

where Lx is an operator that usually stands for the integration over the x
variable, and the function K+(α, x) is termed as the kernel of transformation.
If Q(α) is known, then one can determine the function q(x) by means of an
inverse transformation

(2)

(3)

q(x) = Lα[K−(α, x)Q(α)].

2

In (3) Lα is the operator of inverse transformation implying the summation
or integration over the parameter α, K−(α, x) is the kernel of inverse trans-
formation. The expressions (2) and (3) describe the Fourier, Hankel, Laplace,
Mellin transforms etc. Suppose that (1) is given and it is required to ﬁnd an
explicit expression for some given function g(y), i.e., to ﬁnd g = g(x). We
have from (1):

Lα[K−(α, x)R(α)] = Lα[K−(α, f )R(α)]

(4)

Here R(α) is not known. The right hand side of the expression (4) is a
transform of the type (3) for some function of y. We shall require that this
function be the one of interest to us, g(y). We can then determine the un-
known function R(α). Thus,

g(y) = Lα[K−(α, f )R(α)],

R(α) = Lf [K+(α, f (y))g(y)].

Since the left hand side of (4) is also equal to g(y), then taking into account
(6) we obtain the required explicit representation for g(y) as a function of x:

g(x) = Lα[K−(α, x)Lf [K+(α, f (y))g(y)].

So, if we have the implicit expression of the form (1), we can ﬁnd the explicit
representation g (x) for some function g(y) by means of the formula (7).
Although the method under consideration in this or that form is known in
mathematics, e.g., in the theory of Bessel functions [2], however, it is rarely
applied in physics. The approach similar to the one discussed above may be
of help also at calculations of intricate sums over Bessel functions [3].

2) Now, we shall determine the explicit solution for the nonlinear one-
dimensional plasma waves in cold plasma. These waves are described by a
set of equations consisting of the equation of motion and continuity equation
for plasma electrons as well as of the Poisson equation:

where ve and ne are the velocity and density of electrons, no is the equilibrium
value of density, ϕ - the electric potential that is related with the electric ﬁeld
strength by means of the formula E = −∂ϕ(cid:30)∂Z, e and me being the electron
charge and mass respectively. For steady nonlinear waves propagating with
the phase velocity vph, one can obtain from (8)-(10) the following equation

where τ = ωpe(t − Z(cid:30)vph), ωpe = (4πnoe2(cid:30)me)1/2 is the electron plasma
frequency. Multiplying (11) by dϕ/dτ one can ﬁnd the ﬁrst integral in the
form (dϕ/dτ )2(cid:30)2 + U(ϕ) = const. The integration of the latter expression
gives an implicit solution of the problem [4] (see also [5]):

τ = f (y) = − arccos y − A(1 − y2)1/2.

(1 + A)2, Φ is the dimensionless electric potential , A = vm/vph 6 1, where
vm is the maximum velocity of electrons in the wave. We try to obtain the
explicit expression for the dimensionless potential Φ(τ ) as an series expansion
into harmonics , i.e., in the form of Fourier series (note that the procedure
to be described below may be pursued also for another quantity, e.g., for
Φ1/2). Since according to (12) Φ(τ ) is an even function, we shall seek the
explicit expression in the form of Fourier series that comprises the cosines
only. Then, pursuant to the above method, we have from (12),

as well as the known recurrent expressions for the Bessel and trigonometrical

The nonlinear plasma waves excited by bunches of charged particles were
formerly studied by simulation of the initial equation (8) - (10) [6]. The plots
for the potential and strength of electric ﬁeld in the plasma wave obtained by
(17) and (18), and those obtained by means of computer simulation of nonlin-
ear plasma wave excitation [6] practically coincided in case when the ampli-
tudes of waves were equal . For weak plasma waves, when A = vm/vph ≪ 1,
the series expansions in (17) and (18) are rapidly converging. Hence, in the
linear case we arrive at the well known result: ϕ ≈ ϕmax cos τ ; E ≈ Emax sin τ .
The contribution of the harmonics increases with the amplitude and leads to
characteristic steepening of the wave and eventually to the wavebreaking at
A = 1, Emax = meωpevph/|e|.

Thus, the nonlinear variation of the shape of plasma wave is connected
with the increase in contribution of harmonics. In the theory of processes
involving weakly nonlinear plasma waves one can conﬁne to the consideration
of a few (say, the ﬁrst two or three) terms in the series expansions (17) and
(18).

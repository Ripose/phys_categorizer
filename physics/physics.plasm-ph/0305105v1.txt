Abstract

Analytical solutions for reconnective annihilation in curvilinear geometry are pre-
sented. These solutions are characterized by current density distributions varying
both along the radial and azimuthal coordinates. They represent an extension of
previously proposed models, based on purely radially dependent current densities.
Possible applications of these solutions to the modeling of solar ﬂares are also dis-
cussed.

1 Introduction

Magnetic reconnection is a process in which magnetic energy is converted
into kinetic and thermal energy of a plasma. Its importance lies in the fact
that magnetic reconnection is believed to be one of the underlying mecha-
nisms responsible for many phenomena occurring in astrophysical plasmas,
such as solar ﬂares and geomagnetic substorms [1,2]. After the early works of
Parker [3], Sweet [4] and Petschek [5] considerable eﬀort has been made to
improve the theory of magnetic reconnection with the help of exact analyti-
cal models for reconnective annihilation in Cartesian coordinates [6,7,8]. More
recently exact solutions for magnetic reconnection in curvilinear coordinates
have been presented [9,10,11]. Some features of these solutions make them

particularly interesting for modeling a large class of solar ﬂares. In this paper
we present analytical two-dimensional solutions for reconnective annihilation
in polar coordinates which extend the model derived in [9,10] to the case of
current density distributions depending on both the radial and the azimuthal
variable.

2 Basic equations

We consider the system of magnetohydrodynamics equations in polar coordi-
nates for a two-dimensional steady and incompressible plasma with uniform
density and resistivity discussed in [10]. This system consists of the equation
of motion

to the inverse magnetic Reynolds number. The Poisson brackets are here de-

be mentioned that in absence of an electric ﬁeld the system possesses regular
solutions describing ﬁeld-aligned ﬂows with one or an inﬁnite number of null
λ2. Singularities in the ideal
and stagnation points depending on the sign of
solutions (16) can be resolved by means of a ﬁnite resistivity. Here we derive
solutions for λ
= 0, characterized by current density distributions depending
on both r and θ, unlike the case λ = 0 where the current density is purely
radially dependent.

3 Solutions for A1 and ψ1

For the functions A1 and ψ1 we assume the following boundary conditions:

A1(1) = Bre,

ψ1(1) = vre,

A1(rc) = 0,

ψ1(rc) = 0,

where Bre and vre represent constant values of the radial component of the
magnetic and velocity ﬁeld imposed at the radius r = 1, while rc indicates the
radius at which A±1 and ψ±1 have a zero. The ideal solutions (14) and (15), as
in the case of the logarithmic solution (13), can satisfy all of the four boundary
conditions (17) and (18) taking the form

A fundamental diﬀerence between the cases λ = 0 and λ
= 0 is that for the
former the ideal solutions for A1 and ψ1 provided by (11) and (13) are also
exact solutions of the complete resistive equations (7) and (10). For λ
= 0,
however, this is not the case. In fact, comparing the Taylor expansion about
rc of the exact solutions of (7) and (9) with the one of the ideal solutions it
transpires that a mismatch occurs between A±′′′1
(rc) and the third derivative
of the exact solution for A1 at rc . Due to the high complexity of the nonlinear
equations (7) and (9) we limit ourselves to solve them in an approximated way.
In particular we seek solutions satisfying the imposed boundary conditions and
whose Taylor expansions about rc are compatible with the ones of the exact
solutions at least up to the third derivative, in order to resolve the lowest
order mismatch between ideal and exact solutions. Since the typical value of
the dimensionless resistivity η for many astrophysical and laboratory plasmas
14 we can consider η as a small parameter and use the
is between 10−
method of matched asymptotic expansions. We separate the problem in two
domains, an inner region consisting of a narrow layer containing rc, where the
ideal solution breaks down, and an outer region, complementary to the inner
region, where (19) and (20) are approximate solutions. Asymptotic expansions
for A1 and ψ1 are found in the inner region and then matched with the outer
zeroth order expansion (19), (20) and (21). In order to derive inner solutions of

It should be noted that in the limit rc
the above equations reduce to the
rescaled equations for the problem in Cartesian coordinates considered in [8].
An asymptotic expansion in powers of η is chosen as a form of solutions for (23)
and (24). Also in curvilinear geometry the rescaled equations depend explicitly
on η and in particular the square root of η is present in them. Therefore it is
natural to choose inner solutions of the following form:

→ ∞

(24)

¯A1 = ¯A10(s) + √η ¯A11(s) + η ¯A12(s) +
¯ψ1 = ¯ψ10(s) + √η ¯ψ11(s) + η ¯ψ12(s) +

· · ·
· · ·

(25)

where, unlike to the case of Cartesian geometry, the square root of η appears
in the expansions. The resulting inner solutions are then written in terms
of the original variable, expanded as η
0 for ﬁxed r and matched with
the expansion about rc of the outer solutions (19) and (20). Eventually one

is a positive quantity. The inner solutions (26) possess the required properties,
since they satisfy the boundary conditions (18) and ¯A1±′′′(rc) is consistent with
the value of the third derivative of the exact solution at rc. By combining
(26) with (19), (20) and (21) composite solutions can be found, which are
approximately valid over the whole domain of interest.

4 Solutions for A0′ and ψ0′

As boundary condition for A0′ we impose

A0′(rc) = 0.

(29)

This constraint, together with (18), ﬁxes the position of a magnetic null at
the point (r = rc, θ = 0). On the other hand, as mentioned in Sec. 3 the
ideal solutions (16) become singular at rc which is in striking contrast with
the condition (29). Therefore the ideal solution for A0′ and ψ0′ also breaks
down at r = rc and a boundary layer analysis is required in order to ﬁnd
approximate resistive inner solutions satisfying (29). The inner equations for
A0′ and ψ0′ are derived by rescaling the independent variable in Eqs. (8) and
(10) in the following way:

Then an asymptotic expansion in powers of η is sought in the form

A0′ = A0

0′ + √ηA1
0′,

ψ0′ = ψ0

0 ′ + √ηψ1
0 ′.

(30)

In the equations for the inner solutions A1 and ψ1 are replaced by the leading
terms of the Taylor expansions of (26) about s = 0. The resulting equations
are formally equivalent to the corresponding equations solved in [10]. The
composite solutions obtained after the matching with (16) are given by

The solutions derived in Sec. 3 and 4 describe stationary magnetic and veloc-
ity ﬁelds whose topologies are nontrivial due to the presence of a magnetic
null point at (r = rc, θ = 0) and of a stagnation point at (r = rc, θ =
3σ±](arc + b/rc). Each of these singular points is located
[(
at the intersection of two separatrix lines, one of which, corresponding to the
arc r = rc, is in common to both points. Along this shared separatrice a
curved sheet of enhanced current density is present, allowing for reconnection
of magnetic ﬁeld lines that are advected by the ﬂow from the outer region.
The rate at which reconnection occurs is given by the parameter E that does
not depend on η. Thus these solutions belong to the class of fast reconnection
models. As in the case of many other magnetohydrodynamics models of re-
connective annihilation [7,8,9,12] a limit to the reconnection rate is imposed
by the requirement of incompressibility. Indeed, consider the expression for
the plasma pressure given by

p =

with constant p0. The second term on the right hand side of (31) is negative
and diverges as r
. Therefore, in order for p to be a positive quantity,
the domain of the solutions must be limited to a ﬁnite region of space.
The current density is perpendicular to the r-θ plane and its expression is
given by

from where it is possible to notice the linear dependence of j on θ. With the
help of (12) it is also possible to see that this dependence is absent for λ = 0.

The variation of the current density with θ can clearly be seen in Fig. 1, which
shows that this variation is considerably large in the outer region, while in the

the plane y = 0. The number of sources depends on the value of λ and on how
large the domain of validity of the solution is. The latter cannot be chosen
arbitrarily large because it would then include additional zeros of (14) where
the solutions become singular. However this is not an additional restriction.
Indeed, as already mentioned above, the exact magnetohydrodynamic solu-
tions for incompressible plasma are usually valid only in a ﬁnite size region
anyway because of the lower limitation on the pressure. On the other hand,
λ2 < 0 resemble very
the magnetic and ﬂow conﬁgurations corresponding to
much the ones for λ = 0 solutions, which are regular everywhere and therefore
they are not subject to restrictions due to the presence of singularities. The
current density for this branch of solutions varies also linearly with θ but in
λ2 > 0.

6 Conclusions

Solutions of the steady two dimensional MHD equations for an incompressible
plasma in polar coordinates have been derived using a matched asymptotic
expansion technique where the inverse magnetic Reynolds number has been
assumed to be very small. Two branches of solutions have been obtained de-
pending on the value of one parameter related to the variation of the cur-
rent density with the azimuthal variable. The magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration

8

described by the solutions has a null point at a certain radius. Along this
radius a curved current layer is formed, which causes the reconnection of ﬁeld
lines. In the magnetic conﬁguration three alternating polarities lying on the
plane y = 0 produce the magnetic ﬁeld with the null point in the volume
above. This feature has interesting applications to solar physics because the
presence of three alternating polarities on the photospheric plane is a feature
common to a large class of solar ﬂares [13]. For one branch of solutions, in
general, on the plane y = 0 an odd number of sources is present, three of
which interacting with each other. This number depends on the value of the
parameter λ and on the size of the domain of validity of the solutions. The
reconnection rate does not depend on the resistivity therefore these solutions
belong to the class of models providing fast reconnection regimes.

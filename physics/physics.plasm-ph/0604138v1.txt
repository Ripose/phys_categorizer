Abstract

The collisionless expansion of spherical plasmas composed of cold ions and hot electrons is ana-

lyzed using a novel kinetic model, with special emphasis on the inﬂuence of the electron dynamics.

Simple, general laws are found, relating the relevant expansion features to the initial conditions

of the plasma, determined from a single dimensionless parameter. A transition is identiﬁed in

the behavior of the ion energy spectrum, which is monotonic only for high electron temperatures,

otherwise exhibiting a local peak far from the cutoﬀ energy.

Recent experiments on the interaction of ultraintense laser pulses with atomic and molec-

ular clusters [1, 2] have shown the possibility of accelerating ions to energies of interest for

many applications, such as nuclear fusion and X-ray generation. The interpretation of these

experiments and the need of controlling critical features of the ion acceleration (in particular,

their energy spectrum) require a theoretical insight of the laws governing the collisionless

expansion of a spherical plasma driven by hot electrons. A detailed knowledge of the kinet-

ics of the expansion is also necessary for particular applications, such as the biomolecular

imaging with ultrashort X-ray pulses [3], where sample damage before the imaging time

must be avoided. Moreover, the strong interplay between ions and electrons when using

high-intensity lasers can be used to control the expansion of large clusters, by tailoring the

ion phase space [4]. At present, analytical solutions for a spherical expansion exist only

for ideal cases, such as the Coulomb explosion (CE) [5] of a pure ion plasma, which occurs

when all the electrons are suddenly swept away from the cluster by the laser ﬁeld. In op-

posite conditions, hydrodynamic models have been proposed [6] to estimate basic features

of expansions far from the CE regime, while a kinetic solution for the adiabatic expansion

of plasma bunches into a vacuum has been derived in the quasineutral limit [7]. However,

such extreme situations are hardly met in experiments, in particular for large clusters, as

the laser intensity is insuﬃcient to drive a pure CE but high enough to produce relevant

charge buildups within the clusters: in such cases, the expansion is described correctly only

by kinetic models, based on the Vlasov-Poisson equations.

In this Letter, the long-term

dynamics of the expansion of spherical plasmas is analyzed by using a novel Lagrangian

model, which allows a self-consistent, kinetic description of the radial motion of the ions

and of the three-dimensional motion of nonrelativistic electrons, with high accuracy and low

computational eﬀort. The important case of initially-Maxwellian electrons is investigated in

detail, with special emphasis on the inﬂuence of the initial conditions. Simple relationships

are deduced for the most important physical quantities, valid for a wide range of character-

istic parameters of the expansion. These empirical formulae are surprisingly accurate and

suggest the possibility of a rigorous analytical derivation. Furthermore, the study of the

asymptotic phase of the expansion shows that the behavior of the ion energy spectrum for

realistic conditions diﬀers greatly from that of a pure CE. Finally, the importance of these

results to interpret experimental data is discussed.

For the present analysis, the electrons are assumed to be heated instantaneously, as upon

2

irradiation with an ultrashort laser pulse, and their initial distribution is assumed to be

Maxwellian, with temperature T0. The expansion process is divided in two stages: a rapid

expansion of the electrons, which leads to an equilibrium conﬁguration before the ions move

appreciably, and a subsequent, slower expansion of the plasma bulk. The analysis of the

early expansion (characterized by density oscillations that are damped on a time scale much

faster than the ion motion) is necessary in order to evaluate the equilibrium distribution of

the electrons, which is used as initial condition for the bulk expansion. The dynamics of

the plasma is analyzed self-consistently by following the motion of the ions, along with the

evolution of the electron distribution, which is described as a sequence of ergodic equilibrium

conﬁgurations, so that the only independent variable related to the electrons is their total
energy ǫ = 1

eΦ (the electrostatic potential Φ is set to zero at inﬁnity, so that ǫ < 0

2mev2

−

for trapped electrons). A Lagrangian approach is used for both ions (which move radially,

starting from the initial position r0, with zero velocity) and electrons (whose energy ǫ evolves

in time starting from the initial value ǫ0). The model determines the ion trajectories ri(r0, t),

the electron energies ǫ(ǫ0, t), the ion density ni(r, t), the electron density ne(r, t), and the

potential Φ(r, t), according to the set of equations

where mi is the ion mass, and Z the ion charge state. The expansion dynamics is determined

once the initial ion density ni,0 and the electron energy distribution ρe,0 are given. In Eq.

(1d), the electron density is expressed as the sum of the number of electrons ρe(ǫ)dǫ =

ρe,0(ǫ0)dǫ0 having energy in [ǫ, ǫ + dǫ], multiplied by the probability for an electron with

energy ǫ to be found at the radius r, according to the ergodic distribution. Due to the large

mass disparity between ions and electrons, the ergodic invariant [8] for the electrons [i.e.,
the phase-space volume enclosed by the surface of equation 1

eΦ = ǫ, as deﬁned

2mev2

−

in Eq.

(1e)] is conserved; this determines the electron energy distribution at any time

3

during the expansion of the plasma bulk. Even though Eq.

(1c) is written under the

hypothesis of no ion overtaking (∂ri/∂r0

= 0) [5], the model can be easily generalized to

include many-branched shock shells [4] and diﬀerent ion species. As can be noticed by

writing Eqs. (1) in dimensionless form, the dynamics of the expansion depends on the single
parameter ˆT0 = ZkBT0/ǫCE = 3λ2

0, being λD the Debye length for the electrons, and

D/R2

ǫCE = ZeQ0/R0 the maximum ion energy attainable from the CE of a uniformly-charged

sphere of ions, with radius R0 and total charge Q0.

The study of the bulk expansion does not require the detailed knowledge of the early

expansion transient, but only its ﬁnal equilibrium. Equations (1d) and (1e) are valid only

for suﬃciently-smooth variations of Φ(r, t) in time, a condition which is not met in the early

stage when the electrons are suddenly allowed to expand (as if a rigid wall, initially conﬁning

the hot electrons, were instantaneously brought to inﬁnity). However, these equations can

still be used by introducing a rigid potential barrier and gradually moving it outward,

provided that special care is taken to avoid any energy exchange between the electrons and

the expanding wall [this is done with a suitable adjustment of Eq. (1e)], which would lead

to an overestimate of the electron cooling. The validity of this procedure has been tested

by using reference results from particle-in-cell simulations [9]. In the comparisons, a cluster

of radius R0 = 32 nm was considered, with electron density 2.3

1022 cm−3, for diﬀerent

electron temperatures spanning the range 1-10 keV. In Figure 1, the equilibrium electron

Once the initial equilibrium distribution of electrons is determined, thus setting the initial

conditions of the plasma, the expansion can be analyzed by solving Eqs. (1). The early phase

of the bulk expansion is responsible for the main part of the ion acceleration. In this stage,
the inner ions expand much slower than the outer ions: for ˆT0

0.1, the plasma core stays

≪

initially still, while a rarefaction front propagates inward until it ﬁnally encompasses the
whole ion distribution. On the contrary, for ˆT0 & 0.1, all the ions are promptly involved in

the expansion. The diﬀerent behaviors are depicted in Fig. 3, where the radial trajectories

of isodensity points are plotted, for the same cases of Fig. 1. The case of Fig. 3b represents

a reference situation of practical interest, in which the clusters undergo a rapid expansion

in a hybrid regime, far from both the hydrodynamic limit and the CE regime.

In such

situation, previous models do not provide an accurate description of the expansion, because

a self-consistent study of the electron and ion dynamics is required. As illustrated in Fig.

4 (for the scenario of Fig. 3b), the electrons rapidly cool down and the charge buildup

within the ion front decreases, until a ballistic regime is reached for both species [11]. In

general, the electron dynamics strongly aﬀects the energy spectrum of the ions, by reducing

the repulsive electric ﬁeld. Consequently, the ﬁnal energies of the ions are lower with respect

to the CE case. In fact, the asymptotic energy ǫ∞ of an ion starting at r0 is given by

where q(r, t) is the net charge buildup enveloped by a sphere of radius r at time t. The

integral term (vanishing for a CE) accounts for the energy loss due to the decrease of the

positive charge buildup experienced by each ion along its trajectory. As expected, the shape

of the asymptotic energy spectrum of the ions and its cutoﬀ energy depend strongly on the
initial conditions, as shown in Fig. 5: for ˆT0 = 7.2

10−2, the spectrum exhibits a maximum

×

at 12% of the energy cutoﬀ, 0.27ǫCE. Such distribution is qualitatively and quantitatively
diﬀerent from the asymptotic spectrum of a pure CE, 3
2 (ǫ/ǫCE)1/2, with cutoﬀ energy ǫCE.
As ˆT0 increases, the distribution ﬂattens until the maximum disappears for ˆT0 = 0.5 (a

condition close to the CE regime, with cutoﬀ above 0.7ǫCE), which can hence be taken as a
lower bound for the validity of the CE model. The cutoﬀ ion energy ǫmax as a function of ˆT0

5

is shown in Fig. 6, along with the energy corresponding to the peak in the spectrum, ǫpeak.

The cutoﬀ energy admits a simple ﬁt in the form

(4)

which, for ˆT0
power-law behavior, as ǫpeak = 0.3 ˆT 0.9

1, reduces to ǫmax

≪

≃
0 ǫCE.

In recent experiments [2] on the interaction of intense lasers (1016

1017 W/cm2) with large

hydrogen clusters (up to 2

105 atoms), the measured ion spectra exhibit a local maximum,

−

×

which has been explained, in the framework of a CE model, as an eﬀect of the distribution

of cluster sizes. The present analysis shows that nonmonotonic energy spectra can also

arise from single-cluster eﬀects, indicating that a maximum can appear even for narrow

distributions of cluster radii (for example, with large clusters containing 106

107 atoms).

−

In such cases, the spectrum features (speciﬁcally, the laws for ǫpeak and ǫmax presented here)

also provide an estimate for the initial electron temperature.

In conclusion, the dynamics of the electron-driven expansion of spherical nanoplasmas

has been fully analyzed using a new kinetic model. Simple, accurate laws have been derived

for the general properties of the expansion, which are valid for any value of initial electron

temperature (as long as relativistic eﬀects are negligible). The study also revealed peculiar

features of the ion energy spectrum (namely, the presence of a local maximum and the

transition from nonmonotonic to monotonic behavior) that are not taken into account by

simpliﬁed models and that can be important for the interpretation of experiments, where

single-cluster eﬀects are relevant. Moreover, the strong dependence on the initial conditions

indicates the possibility of tailoring the ion spectrum, thus improving control over the plasma

expansion.

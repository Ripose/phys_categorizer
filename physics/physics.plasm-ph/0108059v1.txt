Transport in a laser irradiated thin foil

(February 2, 2008)

Three dimensional Particle-In-Cell simulations describing the interaction of a short intense laser
pulse with thin foils are presented. It is observed that the laser generated electron current decays
into magnetically isolated ﬁlaments. The ﬁlaments grow in scale and magnitude by magnetic re-
connection. Two diﬀerent laser wavelengths are considered. The spatial separation of the ﬁlaments
varies for the two wavelengths. Many current ﬁlaments carry net electric currents exceeding the
Alfven current considerably.

Key issues of laser-matter interaction at high intensities are the absorption of large fractions of the irradiated
laser energy and the transport of large energy ﬂows through a plasma. A typical application of intense laser-matter
interaction is Fast Ignition (FI) in Inertial Conﬁnement Fusion (ICF) [1–3]. While FI requires large laser facilities
high ﬁeld experiments with thin foils promise to show interesting transport properties in dense plasma with moderate
requirements for pulse energy [4,5]. Laser heated foils have been proposed for x-ray generation and harmonic emission
[6,7], for the production of well-deﬁned dense plasma ﬁlms [8], and as targets for eﬃcient ion acceleration [9]. Hence,
there is both experimental and theoretical interest in a good characterization of laser-irradiated thin foils.

We call foils thin when their thickness is larger than a few skin lengths ls = c/ωp, where ωp is the plasma frequency,
and very much smaller than the mean free path of the electrons. This deﬁnition has some ambiguity since a reasonable
deﬁnition depends on the physics which is investigated. The latter however is not fully known. Two dimensional (2D)
simulations in the plane perpendicular to the laser direction have recently been reported [10]. In these simulations
the laser has been neglected and fast particles have been injected by hand. However, it is an open question to which
extend laser-generated spectra can be modeled.
In addition, 2D geometry severely limits the available degrees of
freedom for current transport and magnetic ﬁeld evolution.

Here we investigate mechanisms of self-organization in laser-generated charge ﬂows in thin foils in full 3D where the
laser produces the hot particle spectra. We show that merging of magnetic ﬁlaments [11] is an important process to
build up larger ﬁlaments. We show that this process proceeds slowly in time as soon as a balance between magnetic
and thermal pressures in the plasma is reached. For a relatively cold plasma into which a well deﬁned beam is
injected it is found that the Alfven current [12,13] cannot be exceeded [10,14]. However, in this paper it is revealed
that laser generated charge ﬂows can exceed a reasonably deﬁned Alfven current limit. To address the problems
discussed we perform two Particle-In-Cell simulations (PIC) with diﬀerent parameters in 3D for a short intense laser
pulse interacting with a sharp edged thin foil of many times over-critical plasma. Collisions will be neglected in both
simulations.

The simulations mentioned diﬀer only in the laser wavelengths. The ﬁrst one has λ = 0.815µm and the second λ =
1.612µm. All ﬁelds depend on x, y, and z. The simulation boxes are 10µm × 10µm × 4µm large and periodic in lateral
directions. The grids have 400×400×400 cells. Electrons and ions are presented by equal quasi-particle numbers. The
total number of quasi-particles in the simulations is 1.28 · 108. The initial electron and ion temperatures are 10.0 keV
and 1.0 keV respectively. The laser pulses propagate in z and are linearly polarized along x. After a rise time of three
optical cycles the laser intensity is kept constant. The incident laser pulses have a Gaussian envelope laterally with
a width of 2.5µm at full-width-half-maximum. The irradiances in both cases are Iλ2 = 6.0 · 1018Wcm−2µm2. The
foils have a marginal initial deformation to enhance absorption to generate large currents [4]. The deformations are
parameterized by z(x, y) = δ ·exp
where δ = 0.4µm, x0 = y0 = 5.0µm, and r = 2.5µm.
The center of the foils are located at z = 2.2µm. The thicknesses are 0.6 µm. The background ions consist of carbon
and are assumed to be singly charged. The plasma density in the simulations is ne = 3.33 · 1022 cm−3. The coordinate
system used in the simulations is right handed. Hence, the positive z-axis points out of the xy-plane shown in the
ﬁgures. In what follows we will always use the positive z-axis for reference.

Plot (a) of Fig. 1 shows the plane y = 5.0 µm of the cycle averaged magnetic ﬁeld |B| deﬁned in the ﬁgure caption.
Plot (b) of the same ﬁgure gives the plane z = 2.6 µm of |B|. Plot (c) shows a magniﬁcation of the central area of
the foil in plot (b) at z = 2.6 µm. The arrows plotted over the pictures indicate the direction of the ﬁeld vector of B.
Plots (a,b,c) are for λ = 0.815µm while plots (d,e,f) show the same for λ = 1.62µm. In the center of the foil magnetic
ﬁlaments are observed. As is seen from plots (c,f) the magnetic ﬁeld in the ﬁlaments rotates counter-clockwise when
viewed along the positive z-axis. The peak magnetic ﬁeld strength which is obtained in the ﬁlaments is about 8700 T

for λ = 0.815µm and 5500 T for λ = 1.63µm. The white arrows in plots (b,e) show that the central magnetic ﬁlaments
are surrounded by a magnetic ﬁelds of larger scale. The topology of this ﬁeld is such that it rotates clockwise in front
of the foil where z < 2.2µm holds and counter-clockwise at the rear of it for z > 2.2 µm. This is a consequence of
electrons escaping into the vacuum both at the front and rear of the foil in opposite directions. The electrons escape
from the center and return along the front and rear foil surfaces. The total electric current obtained by integrating
over the whole lateral foil extension disappears on both the front and rear sides of the foil (see Fig. 5).

Plots (a,b,c) of Fig. 2 show the evolution of the magnetic ﬁlaments for λ = 1.63µm. Plot (a) indicates the early
stage of the ﬁlament evolution. Filaments are very small initially. There have been eﬀorts to describe this early stage
with the help of the Weibel theory [15,16]. Later the small ﬁlaments reconnect [11] to form larger scales as is seen from
plot (b). Plot (c) shows the saturation scale. Reconnection in the present context can be understood qualitatively
with the help of Eq. (2) derived later in the paper which describes the total force on a ﬁnite plasma volume V . In
case V contains a single ﬁlament for which j × B has a large degree of asymmetry a net force is obtained. When
two ﬁlaments approach each other the magnetic ﬁelds of the latter tend to cancel in the overlapping region leading
to further asymmetry in j × B. Hence, the two ﬁlaments reconnect to form a larger one. The magnetic ﬁeld topology
is changing in the course of the process since initially closed ﬁeld lines in diﬀerent ﬁlaments end up as a single new
ﬁlament with again closed ﬁeld lines. The energy required is provided by the laser driver.

Plot (a) of Fig. 3 shows the cycle averaged current ﬁlaments obtained in the foil for λ = 0.815µm. The simulation
reveals roughly twenty of them where only the dark dots visible in the center of plot (a) have been counted for a
ﬁlament. Plot (b) of the same ﬁgure gives a magniﬁed view of the central current ﬁlaments for better illustration.
The peak current density in the ﬁlaments is |jz| = 1.6 · 1017 A/m2. Plots (c,d) show the same for λ = 1.62µm. The
peak current density in the ﬁlaments is now |jz| = 7.6 · 1016 A/m2. It is evident that the ﬁlament separation and scale
are larger for λ = 1.62µm while the current density is approximately half the short wavelength value. Current density
and ﬁlament scale are correlated as is implied by Eq. (1) derived later in this paper.

Plots (a,b,c) of Fig. 4 compare current density, total current, and Alfven current in the central region of the foil
for λ = 1.62µm. The white rectangles indicate the area over which the current density in (a) has been integrated
to obtain the total current given in (b). The size of the rectangle is such that it matches approximately the cross
sectional area of a single ﬁlament. Plot (b) has been obtained moving the rectangle over plot (a) point-wise. The
1 − β2.
Alfven current shown in (c) has been calculated with the help of IA = 17.0 βγ kA, where β = v/c and γ = 1/
The quantity β has been obtained from the averaged velocity obtained from the fastest particles that constitute the
d3p f (x, p, t). Next,
net current in a particular space-time point. This means that cβ(x, t) =
β(x, t)|z=2.6µm is averaged over the cross sectional area indicated by the white rectangle shown in plot (c). It is seen
that the Alfven current limit thus obtained is exceeded substantially by the net current present in the highlighted
current ﬁlament. We note that there are large ambiguities about how to calculate the Alfven current limit in a hot
laser plasma since no unique particle beam can be identiﬁed in the particle spectrum. We note further that in our
simulations fast electrons do not contribute signiﬁcantly to the net charge ﬂow. The latter is predominantly due to
slow electrons. As a consequence the averaged β is small.

Plot (a) of Fig. 5 shows the electric and magnetic ﬁeld energy distributions for both simulations obtained from
the cycle averaged ﬁelds E and B by integrating the ﬁeld energy densities laterally over the whole foil extension.
In the vacuum the electric ﬁeld energy dominates. In the foil the magnetic ﬁeld energy dominates while the cycle
averaged electric ﬁeld disappears. To show that the total current and return current balance while locally they diﬀer
substantially plot (b) of the same ﬁgure shows the current in both foils obtained by integrating jz laterally as in plot
(a). The peak values of the total electric currents are approximately I = 5.0 · 105 A for λ = 0.815µm and I = 2.5 · 105A
for λ = 1.62µm. For comparison, the total currents limited by the Alfven current are 7.6 · 104A for λ = 0.815µm and
4.1 · 104A for λ = 1.63µm.

To derive a relation between the magnetic force acting on a ﬁlament and the thermal pressure inside the foil we
neglect the electric ﬁeld E since it disappears there. In addition, we are only interested in slowly varying time scales.
Under these assumptions we ﬁnd making use of the Vlasov equation

(j × B)i = ∂jPij ,

Pij =

Summation over repeated indices is implied. The quantity Pij denotes the pressure tensor which is obtained directly

from the simulations. The integral form of Eq. (1) is given by

According to Eq. (2) the force on the plasma volume V is obtained by the pressure acting on the surface surrounding
the volume. From the simulations we ﬁnd that |∂jPzj| ≪ |∂jPxj|, |∂jPyj| holds. This is consistent with the observation
that |j × B|x,y ≫ |j × B|z holds inside the foil. Figure 6 shows magnitude and direction of ∂jPij obtained from the
simulations. Multiplying the magnetic ﬁeld obtained from plot (f) of Fig. 1 with the current density jz in plot (d) of
Fig. 3 and comparing with Fig. 6 it is seen that the magnetic force on the current is approximately balanced by the
kinetic pressure of the electrons for the quasi-steady state shown in the present paper.

Fig. 7 shows the electron spectrum obtained for λ = 1.62µm. We ﬁnd that current and return current contain
fast electron populations. The fast electrons in the return current are fast electrons that have been reﬂected at the
back surface due to the electric ﬁeld present there. Comparing plots (a,b) shows that the fast electrons in the return
current try to escape from the ﬁlaments. Peak electron energies obtained for λ = 1.63µm are of the order of 1.0 MeV
as is seen from plots (a,b) while the electron temperature of the hot electrons found within the inner rectangle (see
plot (c) of Fig. 7 and plot (a) of Fig. 4) as well as within the inner and outer rectangles (see plot (d) of Fig. 7 and
plot (a) of Fig. 4) is roughly 300.0 keV. To understand these low values we note that the foil represents a sharp edged
plasma with n/nc = 80.0 for λ = 1.63µm. Hence, the laser radiation decays rapidly over distances of ls ≈ 0.03µm.
As a consequence the eﬀective ﬁelds in the plasma capable of accelerating electrons become very small.

Transport properties in thick foils cannot be directly predicted on the basis of those found in thin foils. The main
reason is that the electron distribution function in thin foils tends to become symmetric in momentum space which is
not so for extended plasma slabs. As is found in this paper, aa approximate force balance between thermal pressure
and magnetic force can be established in thin foils which is capable of slowing down further ﬁlament reconnection. It
needs to be investigated two which degree the latter is true in thick plasma slabs.

In conclusion, we have shown with the help of 3D PIC simulations that large charge ﬂows generated by intense
laser radiation in thin foils decay into current ﬁlaments. The latter originate from the critical surface and extend into
the bulk plasma. Their separation and magnitude is correlated with the laser wavelength. The current ﬁlaments are
surrounded by magnetic ﬁlaments. The evolution of the magnetic ﬁlaments is mainly governed by ﬁlament merging.
In our simulations this process slows down when an approximate balance between thermal pressure and the magnetic
force acting on the ﬁlaments is reached. The net charge ﬂow in a single ﬁlament can exceed a reasonable deﬁnition
of the Alfven current substantially. For the short wavelength case studied in this paper the net current in a single
ﬁlament exceeds the Alfven current up to 8-fold. However, a reasonable Alfven current deﬁnition turns out to be
ambiguous in the context of hot laser plasmas.

Abstract

Experimental studies of the backward wave oscillator with a ”grid” diﬀraction grat-
ing that is formed by a periodic set of metallic threads inside a rectangular waveguide
are proceeded with study of the generation intensity as a function of the grating
length.

Generation of radiation in millimeter and far-infrared range with nonrel-
ativistic and low-relativistic electron beams gives rise diﬃculties. Gyrotrons
and cyclotron resonance facilities are used as sources in millimeter and sub-
millimeter range, but for their operation magnetic ﬁeld about several tens of
kiloGauss (ω ∼ eH
mc γ) is necessary. Slow-wave devices (TWT, BWT, orotrons)in
this range require application of dense and thin (< 0.1 mm) electron beams,
because only electrons passing near the slowing structure at the distance
≤ λβγ/(4π) can interact with electromagnetic wave eﬀectively. It is diﬃcult to
guide thin beams near slowing structure with desired accuracy. And electrical
endurance of resonator limits radiation power and density of acceptable elec-
tron beam. Conventional waveguide systems are essentially restricted by the
requirement for transverse dimensions of resonator, which should not signiﬁ-
cantly exceed radiation wavelength. Otherwise, generation eﬃciency decreases
abruptly due to excitation of plenty of modes. The most of the above problems

can be overpassed in VFEL [1,2,3,4,5]. In VFEL the greater part of electron
beam interacts with the electromagnetic wave due to volume distributed in-
teraction. Transverse dimensions of VFEL resonator could signiﬁcantly exceed
radiation wavelength D ≫ λ. In addition, electron beam and radiation power
are distributed over the whole volume that is beneﬁcial for electrical endurance
of the system.

The electrodynamical properties of volume diﬀraction structures composed
from strained dielectric threads was experimentally studied in [6]. The elec-
trodynamical properties of a ”grid” volume resonator formed by a perodic
structure built from the metallic threads inside a rectangular waveguide was
considered in [8]. First observation of lasing of the backward wave oscillator
with a ”grid” diﬀraction grating and the volume FEL with a ”grid” volume
resonator that is formed by the periodic set of metallic threads inside a rect-
angular waveguide was described in [9].

In the present paper dependence of the generation intensity as a function of
the grating length is studied for the backward wave oscillation regime.

The ”grid” diﬀraction grating is built from tungsten threads with diameter 0.1
mm strained inside the rectangular waveguide with the cross-section 35 mm x
35 mm and length 300 mm (see Fig.1). The distance between the threads along
the axis OZ is dz = 12.5 mm. A circular electron beam with the diameter
32 mm, the energy ∼200 keV and current ∼2kA passes through the above
structure. Period of grating is chosen to provide radiation frequency ∼ 8.4
GHz. The ”grid” structure is made of separate frames each containing the
layer of 1, 3 or 5 parallel threads with the distance between the next threads
dy = 6 mm). Joining frames provides to get the ”grid” structure with layers
distant dz each from other.

The purpose of the experiment is to study dependence of the generated ra-
diation intensity on the ”grid” grating length (i.e. on the number of frames).
Two types of experiments are reported: with one thread in the frame and with
5 threads in the frame.

In the case of one thread in the frame the maximal radiation power is about
1.5 kWatt. The radiation power is measured for 4, 8, 10 and 24 frames each
containing one thread equidistant from waveguide top and bottom walls. The
result of these measurements is presented in Fig.2, where the radiation power
is normalized to the maximal detected power.

In the case of ﬁve threads in the frame the maximal radiation power is about
8 kWatt. The radiation power is measured for 4, 6, 10, 12, 14 and 22 frames
each containing ﬁve threads distant dy = 6 mm each from other (see Fig.1).
The result of these measurements is presented in Fig.3, where the radiation
power is also normalized to the maximal detected power.

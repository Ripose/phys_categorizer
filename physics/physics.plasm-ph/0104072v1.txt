Abstract

It is found that the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of an axisymmet-
ric gravitating magnetically conﬁned plasma with incompressible ﬂows is governed
by a second-order elliptic diﬀerential equation for the poloidal magnetic ﬂux func-
tion containing ﬁve ﬂux functions coupled with a Poisson equation for the gravi-
tation potential, and an algebraic relation for the pressure. This set of equations
is amenable to analytic solutions. As an application, the magnetic-dipole static
axisymmetric equilibria with vanishing poloidal plasma currents derived recently
by Krasheninnikov, Catto, and Hazeltine [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 , 2689 (1999)] are
extended to plasmas with ﬁnite poloidal currents, subject to gravitating forces
from a massive body (a star or black hole) and inertial forces due to incompress-
ible sheared ﬂows. Explicit solutions are obtained in two regimes: (a) in the
low-energy regime β0 ≈ γ0 ≈ δ0 ≈ ǫ0 ≪ 1, where β0, γ0, δ0, and ǫ0 are related
to the thermal, poloidal-current, ﬂow and gravitating energies normalized to the
poloidal-magnetic-ﬁeld energy, respectively, and (b) in the high-energy regime
β0 ≈ γ0 ≈ δ0 ≈ ǫ0 ≫ 1. It turns out that in the high-energy regime all four
forces, pressure-gradient, toroidal-magnetic-ﬁeld, inertial, and gravitating con-
tribute equally to the formation of magnetic surfaces very extended and localized
about the symmetry plane such that the resulting equilibria resemble the accre-
tion disks in astrophysics.

1. Introduction

The diﬃcult problem of equilibrium with ﬂow has been the subject of an in-
creasing number of investigations (e.g., in relation to the present work see Refs.
[1]-[14], [16], [20]) on both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Even for vanish-
ing gravity the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium of a symmetric
(two dimensional) plasma with arbitrary compressible ﬂows associated, e.g. with
isothermal magnetic surfaces, satisﬁes a second-order partial diﬀerential equation
for the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function ψ coupled with an algebraic Bernoulli
equation for the density [1]. Depending on the value of the poloidal Mach num-
ber M 2 (deﬁned in Sec. 2), the above mentioned equation can be either elliptic
or hyperbolic. Experimental evidence [11, 12, 13, 14], however, conﬁrms that (a)
both density and temperature are to a very good approximation ﬂux functions, i.e.
functions constant on magnetic surfaces, and (b) the poloidal ﬂows (e.g. involved
in the transition from the low to the high conﬁnement regime in tokamaks) lie
within the ﬁrst elliptic region. Similar conditions may also prevail in astrophysi-
cal plasmas at least at distances not close to centers of gravity. For magnetically
conﬁned plasmas the equation is expected elliptic because hyperbolicity, associ-
ated with shock waves, would imply open magnetic surfaces and thereby abrupt
conﬁnement degradation.
In this respect, equilibria with incompressible ﬂows
for which the diﬀerential equation becomes always elliptic has been of particular
interest for both laboratory [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and astrophysical [7, 8, 9, 10] plasmas.
In previous studies [5, 6] we considered ideal MHD equilibria with incom-
pressible ﬂows in cylindrical and toroidal geometries. For a toroidal plasma we
found that the diﬀerential equation decouples from the pressure relation, thus
making the problem analytically solvable. Several classes of analytic solutions of
linearized versions of the above mentioned diﬀerential equation associated with
sheared ﬂows were also obtained. For vanishing ﬂows this equation reduces to
the Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation. Analytic solutions of the nonlinear Grad-
Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation for a plasma with vanishing poloidal current at either
low or high pressure conﬁned by a dipolar magnetic ﬁeld were obtained recently
in Ref. [15]. These studies were then extended to equilibria with purely toroidal
ﬂow [16] (being inherently incompressible because of axisymmetry), to gravitat-
ing magnetic dipolar plasmas without ﬂow [17], and to plasmas with anisotropic
pressure [18].

1

The purpose of the present work is twofold: (a) to extend our equilibrium
equations [6] to the case of a gravitating plasma with incompressible ﬂows, and
(b) with employment of the separable eigenvalue technique introduced in Refs
[15]-[18] to derive analytic magnetic dipolar equilibria for a plasma at ﬁnite pres-
sure and poloidal current with incompressible sheared ﬂows having non-vanishing
toroidal and poloidal components, under the exertion of gravitational forces from
a massive body (a star or a black hole).

In Section 2 the equilibrium equations for an axisymmetric gravitating mag-
netically conﬁned plasma with incompressible ﬂows are derived. These equa-
tions are then reduced further for a plasma conﬁned by the magnetic ﬁeld of a
point dipole in Section 3. Analytic magnetic dipolar solutions are constructed
in Sections 4 and 5 in the following regimes:
(a) in the low-energy regime
β0 ≈ γ0 ≈ δ0 ≈ ǫ0 ≪ 1, where β0, γ, δ0, and ǫ0 are related to the thermal, poloidal-
current, ﬂow, and gravitating energies normalized to the poloidal-magnetic-ﬁeld
energy, respectively, and (b) in the high-energy regime β0 ≈ γ0 ≈ δ0 ≈ ǫ0 ≫ 1.
Finally, the conclusions are summarized in Sec. 6.

2. Stationary equilibrium equations for a gravitating
plasma

The ideal MHD equilibrium states of a gravitating plasma with ﬂow are gov-

erned by the following set of equations, written in convenient units:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

ρ(v · ∇)v = j × B − ∇P − ρ∇Ω

∇ · (ρv) = 0

∇2Ω = G0ρt

∇ × E = 0

∇ × B = j

∇ · B = 0

E + v × B = 0.

2

Here, Ω, 4πG0, and ρt are, respectively, the gravitation potential, the constant
of gravity and the total density including contributions from the plasma itself

and from external mass sources. Standard notations are used in the rest of Eqs.
(1)-(7).

For an axially symmetric plasma the divergence-free ﬁelds can be expressed

in terms of the functions I(R, z), F (R, z) and Θ(R, z) as

B = I∇φ + ∇φ × ∇ψ,

j = ∆⋆ψ∇φ − ∇φ × ∇I

ρv = Θ∇φ + ∇φ × ∇F.

and

and

Here, R, φ, z are cylindrical coordinates with z corresponding to the axis of sym-
metry, constant ψ surfaces are the magnetic surfaces, and ∆⋆ ≡ R2∇ · (∇/R2).
Eqs. (1)-(7) can be reduced by means of certain integrals of the system, which
are shown to be ﬂux functions. To identify three of these quantities, the time
independent electric ﬁeld is expressed by E = −∇Φ and the Ohm’s law (7) is
projected along ∇φ, B and ∇ψ, respectively, yielding F = F (ψ), Φ = Φ(ψ), and

1

ρR2 (IF ′ − Θ) = Φ′.

A fourth ﬂux function is derived from the component of the force-balance equation
(2) along ∇φ:

(21) in Sec. 3). Note that the toroidal quantities I(ψ, R) and Θ(ψ, R) are not
ﬂux functions. With the aid of the ﬂux functions identiﬁed the components of
Eq. (2) along B and perpendicular to a magnetic surface are put in the respective
forms

It is pointed out that Eqs. (13) and (14) hold for any equation of state.

We now consider incompressible ﬂows, ∇ · v = 0, which on account of Eq. (1)
implies that the density is a ﬂux function. With the aid of ρ = ρ(ψ), Eq. (13)
can be integrated to yield an expression for the pressure, i.e.

where Ps(ψ) is a ﬂux function which for vanishing ﬂow and gravity (v = Ω = 0)
represents the static pressure. Deﬁning the Alfv´en velocity associated with the
poloidal magnetic ﬁeld, v2
Ap =
(F ′)2/ρ and inserting the expression (15) into Eq. (14), we arrive at the elliptic
diﬀerential equation

(16)

Eq. (16) contains the arbitrary ﬂux functions F (ψ), Φ(ψ), X(ψ), ρ(ψ) and Ps(ψ)
which must be found from other physical considerations. For Ω ≡ 0 Eqs. (15) and
(16) constitute concise forms of the equilibrium equations we derived formerly [6]
[Eqs. (19) and (22) therein]. We note here that the physically plausible class
of equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces, T = T (ψ), was examined in our
previous studies [5, 6] for vanishing gravity. Incompressible ﬂows and T = T (ψ)
imply that the pressure becomes a ﬂux function. For toroidal plasmas it was
shown that equilibria of this kind are possible. In addition, steady states with
incompressible ﬂows and isobaric magnetic surfaces were proposed in Ref. [3] as
approximate equilibria for the Joint-European-Torus tokamak. It is also noted
that for non-ideal plasmas with arbitrary ﬂows, i.e. when a ﬁnite resistivity is
introduced in Eq. (7), some of the integrals found in this section in the form of
ﬂux functions are destroyed and the tractability of an extension of the present
investigation becomes questionable.

Recapitulating, the axisymmetric ideal MHD equilibria of a gravitating plasma
with incompressible ﬂows are governed by the set of Eqs. (3) and (16) for ψ and
Ω, and relation (15) for the pressure.

Eq. (18) is free of the nonlinear term 1/2(M 2)′|∇ψ|2 and, therefore, for M 2 < 1
the equilibrium can be determined from the more tractable set of Eqs. (3), (15)
and (18).

3. Magnetic-dipole equilibrium equations

The equilibrium of a plasma conﬁned by the magnetic ﬁeld of a current ring
lying on the symmetry plane and centered at the origin of the system of co-
ordinates is now considered. Employing spherical coordinates r, θ and φ with
µ = cos θ and R = r sin θ, we seek separable solutions of Eq. (18) of the form

Here, H is an unknown function of µ alone such that H(0) = 1, and U0 and
r0 are normalization constants specifying a reference ﬂux surface location. The
parameter α plays the role of an eigenvalue of equations (3) and (18). It equals
unity or −2 in the vacuum limit to recover the dipolar solutions ψvac ∝ (1 − µ2)/r
and ψvac ∝ (1 −µ2)r2 describing, respectively, the ﬂux surfaces far away from and
close to the origin. We are interested in conﬁgurations symmetric with respect
to the symmetry plane. Accordingly, the boundary conditions

black hole of mass Ms placed at r = 0; the plasma self gravity is neglected.
Consequently, Eq. (3) decouples from (18) and has the solution

where H → 1 − µ2 as β0 ≈ γ0 ≈ δ0 ≈ ǫ0 → 0. With the use of the boundary

To appreciate the impact of ﬁnite pressure, ﬁnite poloidal current, ﬂow, and
gravity on the vacuum equilibrium, the relations H = 1 − µ2 and α → 1 are
employed into Eq. (30) except for the term 1 − α. The departure of α from unity

Therefore, the modiﬁcations of the vacuum equilibrium from the ﬁnite pressure,
poloidal current, ﬂow, and gravity are of the order of magnitude of β0 ≈ γ0 ≈
δ0 ≈ ǫ0. As a result, an analytic solution of Eq. (29) can be derived by using the
vacuum solution H = 1−µ2 in the ﬁve terms in which H appears undiﬀerentiated.
Using the boundary condition (20) at µ = 1 and introducing t = 1 − µ2 = sin2 θ,

to be veriﬁed a posteriori. The term α(1 + α)H/(1 − µ2) in Eq. (27) is small
everywhere, via relations (20) and (35), and can be neglected.

We ﬁrst search for solutions in the region 0 ≤ µ ≤ µc ≡ 1/β0 ≪ 1. In this
region the approximations 1 − µ2 ≈ 1, H ≈ 1 can be made and, therefore, Eq.
(27) can be written in the form

Evaluation of Eq. (37) at µ = µc yields

|α| = O(1 − H(µc)) ≪ 1,

consistent with assumption (35).

We now consider the whole regime of variation of µ. For 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1 the
terms on the RHS of Eq. (27) are large at µ = 0 and rapidly decrease to zero
as H decreases from H(µ = 0) = 1 toward H(µ = 1) = 0 since |α| ≪ 1.
In
particular, the variations of the terms γ0(1 − µ2)−1α(1 + α)H 1+2/α and δ0(1 −
µ2)α(3 + α)H 1+6/α from 1 − µ2 are much weaker than those from H 1+2/α and
H 1+6/α, respectively. Therefore, in the above terms, 1 − µ2 can be approximated
by unity and, consequently, Eq. (27) can be written in the form

but with a large second derivative of the order of (β0 + γ0 + δ0 + ǫ0)1/2 [see Eq.
(39)]. Eq. (42) implies that the distance between adjacent ﬂux surfaces at the
symmetry plane µ = 0 increases as either of β0, γ0, δ0, and ǫ0 increases. Indeed,
as α decreases the spacing must adjust to keep U ≈ (r0/r)α ﬁxed and, therefore,
the magnetic surfaces become more extended and localized about the symmetry
plane. The resulting equilibria resemble the accretion disks in astrophysics. It is
noted that Krasheninnikov and Catto [16, 17] came to the conclusion that in the
strong gravity limit (ǫ0 ≫ 1), gravity and ﬂow aﬀect the ﬂux surfaces but not
the eigenvalue α. This does not contradict our conclusion because it concerns
diﬀerent density, current and ﬂow regimes, i.e. arbitrary density proﬁles, vanish-
ing poloidal currents, and purely toroidal ﬂows were considered in Refs. [16, 17]
while the present study concerns ﬁnite poloidal currents and magnetic surfaces of
constant density associated with incompressible ﬂows with non vanishing toroidal
and poloidal components.

6. Conclusions

It has been shown that the equilibrium of a gravitating axisymmetric mag-
netically conﬁned plasma with incompressible ﬂows is governed by a second-order
elliptic diﬀerential equation for the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function ψ [Eq. (16)]
containing ﬁve ﬂux functions coupled with a Poisson equation for the gravita-
tion potential, and an algebraic relation for the pressure [Eq. (15)]. The above
mentioned elliptic equation can be transformed to one [Eq. (18)] possessing a

10

diﬀerential part identical to that of the Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation, which
permits the derivation of analytic solutions.

Analytic solutions for a plasma conﬁned by a dipolar magnetic ﬁeld and sub-
ject to gravitating forces from a massive body have been obtained in two energy
regimes: (a) in the low-energy regime β0 ≈ γ0 ≈ δ0 ≈ ǫ0 ≪ 1, where β0, γ0,
δ0, and ǫ0 are related to the thermal, poloidal-current, ﬂow and gravitating en-
ergies normalized to the poloidal-magnetic-ﬁeld energy, respectively, and (b) in
the high-energy regime β0 ≈ γ0 ≈ δ0 ≈ ǫ0 ≫ 1. These solutions generalize the
static magnetic-dipole equilibria with vanishing poloidal currents obtained in Ref.
[15]. It turns out that in the high-energy regime all four forces, pressure-gradient,
toroidal-magnetic-ﬁeld, inertial and gravitating, contribute equally to the forma-
tion of magnetic surfaces very extended and localized about the symmetry plane
such that the resulting equilibria resemble the accretion disks in astrophysics.

Finally, it may be noted that, in addition to their astrophysical concern, the
equilibrium investigations of Refs. [15, 16, 17] and of the present work may help
in developing possible novel magnetic conﬁnement devices. In this view further
studies on the impact of compressible ﬂows or/and self gravity on the equilibrium
properties of plasmas conﬁned in dipolar magnetic ﬁelds are of particular interest.

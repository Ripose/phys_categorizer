Abstract

Recently, two novel techniques for the extraction of the phase-shift map (Tomassini
et. al., Applied Optics 40 35 (2001)) and the electronic density map estimation (Tomassini
P. and Giulietti A. , Optics Communication 199, pp 143-148 (2001) ) have been pro-
posed. In this paper we apply both methods to a sample laser-plasma interferogram
obtained with femtoseconds probe pulse, in an experimental setup devoted to laser
particle acceleration studies.

1 Introduction

The phase-shift extraction from interferogram images is generally performed via a straight-
forward method based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) (Takeda, 1982). This method is
fast and generally very eﬀective, but it can fail in producing accurate phase-shift maps in
facing with low quality fringe structures. Unfortunately, the number of physical processes
that can degrade the fringe visibility is very large. Even if the eﬀects of some of these sources
in the case
can be strongly reduced with reﬁnement of the interferometry techniques (e.g.

1

of uncorrelated noise in the image, non uniform illumination...) or a reduction of the probe
duration (in the case of fringe smearing due to the plasma evolution), the eﬀect of the devia-
tion of the probe light due to strong electronic density gradients cannot be eliminated in the
interferometer acquisition step. As a result, standard FFT technique hardly work properly
when applied to interferograms of very steep density gradients. Recently (Tomassini et. al.,
2001) a new method to extract the phase-shift map from interferograms has been proposed.
The new method IACRE (”Interferogram Analysis via Continuous wavelet transform Ridge
Extraction”) takes advantage of the combined spatial and spectral resolution of the Contin-
uous Wavelet Transforms (CWT) (Holschneider, 1995) to identify the fringe structures and
results more ﬂexible, accurate and robust than standard FFT based one.

Once the phase-shift map has been obtained, one has to face with Abel Inversion in order
to retrieve the 2D electronic density map. The Abel Inversion method is based on the strong
assumption that the full 3D electronic density is axisymmetric along an axis parallel to the
interferometry plane. This assumption is often poorly veriﬁed and if we force in using Abel
Inversion we can introduce large errors in the density map, especially near the best estimated
symmetry axis. In a recent procedure (Tomassini and Giulietti, 2001), Abel Inversion has
been generalized and can be applied to density distributions with a moderate asymmetry. As
a corollary, this generalized Abel Inversion provides a ﬁrst step in 3D density map extraction.

In this paper we show the preliminary results of the analysis of interferograms obtained
with femtosecond laser pulses probing plasmas produced by the exploding foils technique.
The set of interferograms has been produced in order to characterize the plasma before,
during and after the passage of a ultrastrong laser pulse, in an experimental setup devoted
to the study of the production of multi-MeV electrons generated by laser-plasma interactions
(Giulietti et. al., 2001).

2 Interferometry setup

The experiment has been performed on the Salle Jaune of the Laboratoire d’Optique Ap-
pliquee with a laser pulse of wavelength 0.82µm delivering 1Joule in 35f s. A portion of the
pulse has been doubled in frequency with a KDP cristal (probe pulse) and the remaining
portion (main pulse) has been focused with an oﬀ-axis parabola on the target, a thin foil of
FORMVAR (see Fig. 1).

The nanosecond Ampliﬁed Spontaneous Emission (ASE) which precedes the main pulse
makes the foil to explode in the focal spot. As a consequence, the main pulse interacts with
a preformed plasma of peak density well below the critical density and of scalelength of few
tens of µm’s.

The interferometry pulse probes the plasma in a direction parallel to the plastic foil, i.e.
perpendicular to the plasma expansion axis which is also roughly the plasma symmetry axis.
A modiﬁed Normarski interferometrt setup (Benattar et al., 1979) is used to generate the

2

interferometry images on a CCD camera (see Figg. 1 and 2).

3 The phase-shift extraction with the IACRE method

A detailed description of the IACRE method and an accurate comparison between IACRE
and the standard FFT-based methods performances has been published elsewere (Tomassini,
Giulietti and Gizzi, 2000; Tomassini et. al., 2001). In this section we will just sketch the
main steps of the novel method.

Consider the interferogram of Fig. 3. It has been produced 10ps after the interaction of
a preformed plasma with a 35f s main pulse focused on it with an intensity of 1020W/cm2.

The laser radiation came from the right hand side and the plasma is approximately
symmetric along the horizontal x coordinate. The two black arrows refer to the positions of
the two images of the target, while the boxes show the two analyzed regions, one on the side
of the incoming laser radiation (the right one) and one on the rear side.

To apply the IACRE method to the each sub-image (left and right boxes), we extract
the phase shift δφ(z, x) as follow. For each z build a sequence sz(x) by taking the line-out
of the sub-image. Next:

compute the Continuous Wavelet Transform coeﬃcients Cs(a, b) of sz(x), being a and
b the ”voice” and ”time” parameters, respectively;

(Cs) of the Cs map, recording the phase φ(x) of the signal re-

R

estimate the wavevector kp of the unperturbed fringes and, ﬁnally, compute the phase-
shift δφ(z, x) as

δφ(z, x) = φ(z, x)

kpx .

−

The analysis of the test interferogram is complicated by the presence of fringe curvature
also in absence of the plasma. This problem has been solved by acquiring a ”Mask” interfer-
ogram (without plasma) before each shot. A phase-shift of the ”Mask” δφM ask is estimated
and the corrected phase-shift due to the electronic plasma density δφP lasma is obtained simply
as

(3.1)

(3.2)

δφP lasma = δφ

δφM ask .

The results for the left and right boxes sub-images are reported in Fig. 4.

The two phase-shift maps of the front (right box) and rear (left box) sides of the plasma
have quite similar structures, with strong evidence of a hole in the electronic density near the
target, where steep density gradients occur. These gradients are responsible of the reduction
of fringe visibility at the edges of the hole.

4 Non axisymmetric Abel Inversion

We now proceed in the estimation of the electronic density map ne. As it is clear in Fig. 4,
the phase-shift maps are not really mirror symmetric so we expect that the computation of ne
via standard Abel Inversion could introduce relevant errors. We then apply the Generalized
Abel Inversion (Tomassini and Giulietti, 2001) to the corrected phase-shift maps (left and
right boxes) in order to minimize inversion errors. As in the standard Abel Inversion, the
position z0 of the best symmetry axis must be determined by maximizing, for example, the
cross-correlation between the two half maps

next two 2D maps n0(r, x) and n1(r, x) are numerically computed with the integrals:

δφ+(ζ, x) = δφP lasma(z
δφ−(ζ, x) = δφP lasma(z0

The 3D electron density map can now be built-up as follow. First, the map is mirror-
z plane. This assumption is necessary because in the process of
symmetric along the x
formation of the interferogram an integration along the y direction is made. Consider then
one half space (let’s say the one with y positive) and, for each x, identity a point in the y
z
plane by using polar coordinates (r, θ). Finally, the three dimensional map

represents the best estimation of the electronic density map obtained with the Generalized
Abel Inversion. In Fig. 5 the projection in the x
z plane of the density map at both sides
of the target is reproduced, while in Fig. 6 a sequence of slices of the 3D density map in the
left box at constant x is shown.

The projection of the density maps onto the x

z plane (see Figg. 5 and 6) conﬁrms the
presence of a dramatic density depression (hole) along the laser propagation path, near the
original target position.

5 Comments

We applied the IACRE and Generalized Abel Inversion to a sample interferogram, obtained
just few ps after the interaction of an ultraintense femtosecond laser pulse with a preformed
plasma from an exploding thin foil. The density map evidences the creation of a sharp
electron density depression near the original target position.

We mention that the methods has been also applied to a series if interferograms taken
before, during and after the propagation of the ultrarelativistic 35f s pulse with the plasma.

The analysis is still in progress and preliminary results conﬁrm (Tomassini et al., 2001)
that the IACRE method is much more robust and sensitive than standard FFT-based
method, which frequently failed in producing reasonably accurate phase-shift maps. We
then expect that IACRE and Generalized Abel Inversion methods will give a strong contri-
bution in the comprehension of such an extreme laser-plasma interaction regime.

Magnetic reconnection is the breaking and rejoining of
magnetic ﬁeld lines in a plasma. Solar ﬂares are believed
to be a manifestation of this phenomenon [1]. Other clas-
sical examples are reconnection between the solar and
the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld in the magnetopause and the
magnetotail [2] and the sawtooth instability in tokamaks
[3].
In some cases, most notably the sawtooth, recon-
nection takes place in a plane perpendicular to a strong
magnetic ﬁeld, in which case it occurs via the tearing-
mode instability. Linear theory [4] shows that an MHD
equilibrium is tearing-mode unstable if the instability pa-
rameter ∆′ > 0. Analytical and numerical studies of the
tearing mode have been mostly restricted to low values of
∆′. However, it has been shown that kinetic eﬀects can

and there is, indeed, experimental evidence for ∆′

the sawtooth [7]. The evolution of large-∆′ (i.e., strongly
driven) tearing modes, even in the simplest physical mod-
els, remains poorly understood. To address this problem,
we investigate the evolution of the tearing mode in the
broadest ranges of ∆′ and the resistivity η achieved to

date. We ﬁnd that, for suﬃciently large ∆′ and suﬃ-
ciently small η, the tearing mode goes through ﬁve stages
(Fig. 1): (I) linear instability [4], (II) algebraic growth
(Rutherford [8] stage), (III) X-point collapse followed by
current-sheet reconnection (Sweet-Parker [9, 10] stage),
(IV) tearing instability of the current sheet resulting in
generation of secondary islands, and (V) saturation. The
traditional theory of the tearing mode, valid for small ∆′,
comprises just Stages I, II and V. The fact that, at large
∆′, Stage II is succeeded by Stages III, IV, and a modiﬁed
Stage V is new in the tearing-mode context.
We solve the Reduced MHD equations [11]

We now describe the evolution of the tearing mode
stage by stage. During Stages I–II, reconnection occurs
via an X-point conﬁguration. In Stage I, it is a linear in-

in time [4]. Once W exceeds the resistive scale, this stage
gives way to the Rutherford [8] stage (Stage II), during

we plot ∆′Wc vs. η for two diﬀerent values of ∆′. The

resolution constraints, we do not yet have a numerical
conﬁrmation of this conjecture [28].

A detailed view of the instability is given in Fig. 7.
As suggested in [20], a secondary island ﬁrst appears
as a long-wavelength linear perturbation to the current
sheet, with two X points forming at the ends of the sheet
[Fig. 7(b)]. The reconnection proceeds in a manner anal-
ogous to Stages I–III discussed above: as the secondary
island grows, the two secondary X points collapse, giving
rise to two current sheets, while the island is circularized
[Fig. 7(c)]. The primary and the secondary islands exert
attracting forces on each other. When the secondary is-
land is suﬃciently large, this attraction causes it to split
into two parts, which then coalesce with the primary is-
land [Fig. 7(d-f)]. Note that the splitting of the secondary
island into two is a result of the exact symmetry of our
conﬁguration about the x axis. Even a slight breaking of
this symmetry would cause the entire secondary island
to move either upwards or downwards to coalesce with
the primary [29].

We note that, given small enough η, the secondary cur-
rent sheets should be unstable to generation of tertiary
islands etc. Also, if the initial ﬂux is not yet exhausted
after the secondary island has coalesced with the primary,
the primary current sheet can be regenerated via a second
collapse (Fig. 1, Stage IVb). Given suﬃciently large ∆′,
the cycle of current-sheet formation — secondary-island
generation — coalescence may be repeated several times
before saturation is reached.

Stage V: Saturation. The saturated island width in
the limit of small ∆′ has recently been calculated by Es-
cande & Ottaviani [21] and Militello & Porcelli [22], a
theory henceforth referred to, using a liberal permutation
of the ﬁrst letters of the authors’ surnames, as POEM.

as the maximum value of By along the x axis. These curves
do not extrapolate to the origin because the full-width-half-
maximum deﬁnition used for LCS correctly reﬂects the growth
of the current-sheet length but not its true length (thus, it
formally gives LCS > 0 for the X-point reconnection).

Indeed, Eq. (6) is

reconnection if LCS ∼
The elongation of the current sheet ceases when LCS
reaches a signiﬁcant fraction of the box size. Reconnec-
tion can still proceed in a SP fashion, but the growth of
the reconnected ﬂux slows down (see Fig. 1). Indeed, in
the right-hand side of Eq. (6), LCS no longer increases
with Ψ and B0(Ψ) starts to decrease as the initial recon-
nectable ﬂux is used up. In Fig. 6, we show the current-
sheet length LCS and width δCS measured using a full-
width-half-maximum estimate at the time when the max-
imum LCS is reached. We see that, for ﬁxed ∆′, LCS is
η1/2, in agreement
roughly independent of η, while δCS ∼
with the SP prediction. On the other hand, for ﬁxed η,
both LCS and δCS grow linearly with ∆′ (cf. [19]), except
for the largest data point, ∆′ = 52.7 [27].

Stage IV: Secondary Island Generation. When the
aspect ratio of the current sheet A = LCS/δCS & 50,
the sheet itself becomes unstable to tearing modes and
generates secondary islands. We expect that this crit-
ical value is independent of either ∆′ or η, but due to

Ψsat instead of Wsat because, for the largest ∆′ values,
the island width exceeds the box size Lx (in which case
the saturation is likely to be strongly dependent on the
equilibrium conﬁguration). For ∆′ . 5, there is excellent
agreement with POEM [Eq. (7)], but not with White
et al. [23]. The occurence of the X-point collapse, i.e.,
whether the saturation is achieved via current-sheet or
X-point reconnection, changes the saturated state: Fig. 8
shows a jump in Ψsat at values of ∆′ and η for which the
X-point collapse took place in Stage III. For suﬃciently
small η, the saturated amplitude does not depend on η
[Fig. 8(b)]. Also, Ψsat appears to reach a plateau for
large ∆′ [Fig. 8(a)], so that Wsat ∼

In this Letter, we have shown that, for a simple resis-
tive model of the tearing mode with large ∆′, X-point
reconnection gives way to much faster current-sheet re-
connection. Furthermore, the current sheet cannot ex-
ceed a certain critical aspect ratio, above which it frag-
ments into secondary islands and current sheets. We
believe the rather complex behavior we have identiﬁed
to be a generic feature of strongly driven reconnection.
However, a caveat is in order. While the large-∆′ con-
ﬁgurations are often encountered in laboratory reconnec-
tion, understanding the physics responsible for setting
up these conﬁgurations remains a theoretical challenge.
This unknown physics, along with a number of kinetic
eﬀects known to be important in various laboratory and
astrophysical contexts [24], must, strictly speaking, be a

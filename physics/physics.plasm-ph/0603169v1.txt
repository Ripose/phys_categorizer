Abstract

The methods developed in the previous Part I are applied to a few impor-
tant reductions of BBGKY hierarchy, namely, various examples of Vlasov-like
systems. It is well known that they are important both for fusion modeling and
for particular physical problems related to plasma/beam physics. As in part I
we concentrate mostly on phenomena of localization and pattern formation.

1 INTRODUCTION: VLASOV-POISSON

SYSTEM

1.1 Description

In this part we present the applications of our approach based on variational
multiresolution technique [1]-[6], considered in Part I [7], to the systems with
collective type behaviour described by some forms of Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell
equations, some important reduction of general BBGKY hierarchy [8]. Such
approach may be useful in all models in which it is possible and reasonable to
reduce all complicated problems related to statistical distributions to the prob-
lems described by the systems of nonlinear ordinary/partial diﬀerential/integral

equations with or without some (functional) constraints. In periodic accelera-
tors and transport systems at the high beam currents and charge densities the
eﬀects of the intense self-ﬁelds, which are produced by the beam space charge
and currents, determinine (possible) equilibrium states, stability and transport
properties according to underlying nonlinear dynamics. The dynamics of such
space-charge dominated high brightness beam systems can provide the under-
standing of the instability phenomena such as emittance growth, mismatch, halo
formation related to the complicated behaviour of underlying hidden nonlinear
modes outside of perturbative tori-like KAM regions [8]. Our analysis based
on the variational-wavelet approach allows to consider polynomial and rational
type of nonlinearities.
In some sense in this particular case this approach is
direct generalization of traditional nonlinear δF approach [8] in which weighted

where s(x − xji) is a shape function of distributing particles on the grids in
conﬁguration space, are replaced by powerful technique from local nonlinear
harmonic analysis, based on underlying symmetries of functional space such as
aﬃne or more general. The solution has the multiscale/multiresolution decom-
position via nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes, which corresponds to the full
multiresolution expansion in all underlying time/phase space scales. Starting
from Vlasov-Poisson equations, we consider the approach based on multiscale
variational-wavelet formulation. We give the explicit representation for all dy-
namical variables in the base of compactly supported wavelets or nonlinear
eigenmodes. Our solutions are parametrized by solutions of a number of re-
duced algebraical problems, one from which is nonlinear with the same degree of
nonlinearity as initial problem and the others are the linear problems which cor-
respond to the particular method of calculations inside concrete wavelet scheme.
Because our approach started from variational formulation we can control evo-
lution of instability on the pure algebraical level of reduced algebraical system
of equations. This helps to control stability/unstability scenario of evolution in
parameter space on pure algebraical level. In all these models numerical mod-
eling demonstrates the appearance of coherent high-localized structures and as
a result the stable patterns formation or unstable chaotic behaviour. Analysis
based on the non-linear Vlasov equations leads to more clear understanding of
collective eﬀects and nonlinear beam dynamics of high intensity beam propaga-
tion in periodic-focusing and uniform-focusing transport systems. We consider

Mj=c

In some sense it is some generalization of the old δF approach [8]. Let L be
an arbitrary (non) linear diﬀerential/integral operator with matrix dimension
d, which acts on some set of functions

Ψ ≡ Ψ(s, x) =

Ψ1(s, x), . . . , Ψd(s, x)

, s, x ∈ Ω ⊂ Rn+1

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

from L2(Ω):

LΨ ≡ L(R(s, x), s, x)Ψ(s, x) = 0,

where x are the generalized space coordinates or phase space coordinates, and
s is ”time” coordinate. After some anzatzes the main reduced problem may be
formulated as the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations

or a set of such systems corresponding to each independent coordinate in phase
space. They have the ﬁxed initial (or boundary) conditions fi(0), where Pi, Qi
are not more than polynomial functions of dynamical variables fj and have
arbitrary dependence on time. As result we have the following reduced algebraic
system of equations on the set of unknown coeﬃcients λk
i of localized eigenmode
expansion:

L(Qij, λ, αI ) = M (Pij , λ, βJ ),

(15)

where operators L and M are algebraization of RHS and LHS of initial problem
and λ are unknowns of reduced system of algebraical equations (RSAE). After
solution of RSAE (15) we determine the coeﬃcients of wavelet expansion and
therefore obtain the solution of our initial problem. It should be noted that if
we consider only truncated expansion with N terms then we have the system of
N × n algebraic equations with degree

ℓ = max{p, q}

(16)

5

and the degree of this algebraic system coincides with degree of initial diﬀerential
system. So, we have the solution of the initial nonlinear (rational) problem in
the form

fi(s) = fi(0) +

λk
i fk(s),

(17)

N

Xk=1

where coeﬃcients λk
i are the roots of the corresponding reduced algebraic (poly-
nomial) problem RSAE. Consequently, we have a parametrization of solution
of initial problem by the solution of reduced algebraic problem. The obtained
solutions are given in this form, where fk(t) are basis functions obtained via mul-
tiresolution expansions and represented by some compactly supported wavelets.
As a result the solution of equations has the following multiscale/multiresolution
decomposition via nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes, which corresponds to
the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying scales starting from coarsest
one. For

x = (x, y, px, py)

we will have

These formulae give us expansion into the slow part Ψslow

N,M and fast oscillat-
ing parts for arbitrary N, M . So, we may move from coarse scales of resolution
to the ﬁnest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynam-
ical process. The ﬁrst terms in the RHS correspond on the global level of
function space decomposition to resolution space and the second ones to de-
tail space. It should be noted that such representations give the best possible
localization properties in the corresponding (phase)space/time coordinates. In
contrast with other approaches this formulae do not use perturbation tech-
nique or linearization procedures. So, by using wavelet bases with their good
(phase) space/time localization properties we can describe high-localized (co-
herent) structures in spatially-extended stochastic systems with collective be-
haviour. Modeling demonstrates the appearance of stable patterns formation
from high- localized coherent structures or chaotic behaviour. On Fig. 1 we
present contribution to the full expansion from coarsest level of decomposition.
Fig. 2 shows the representations for full solutions, constructed from the ﬁrst six
scales (dilations) and demonstrates (meta) stable localized pattern formation
in comparison with chaotic-like behaviour (Fig. 10, Part I) outside of KAM
region. We can control the type of behaviour on the level of reduced algebraic
system (15).

2 RATE/RMS MODELS

2.1 Description

In this part we consider the applications of our technique based on the meth-
ods of local nonlinear harmonic analysis to nonlinear rms/rate equations for
averaged quantities related to some particular case of nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell
equations. Our starting point is a model and approach proposed by R. C.
Davidson e.a.
[8]. We consider electrostatic approximation for a thin beam.
This approximation is a particular important case of the general reduction from
statistical collective description based on Vlasov- Maxwell equations to a ﬁ-
nite number of ordinary diﬀerential equations for the second moments related
quantities (beam radius and emittance).
In our case these reduced rms/rate
equations also contain some distribution averaged quantities besides the second
moments, e.g. self-ﬁeld energy of the beam particles. Such model is very ef-
ﬁcient for analysis of many problems related to periodic focusing accelerators,
e.g. heavy ion fusion and tritium production. So, we are interested in the under-
standing of collective properties, nonlinear dynamics and transport processes of
intense non-neutral beams propagating through a periodic focusing ﬁeld. Our
approach allows to consider rational type of nonlinearities in rms/rate dynami-
cal equations containing statistically averaged quantities also. The solution has
the multiscale/multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high-localized eigen-
modes (waveletons), which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in
all underlying internal hidden scales. We may move from coarse scales of resolu-
tion to the ﬁnest one to obtain more detailed information about our dynamical
process. In this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of
resolution or each time/space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode. Starting
from some electrostatic approximation of Vlasov-Maxwell system and rms/rate
dynamical models we consider the approach based on variational-wavelet for-
mulation. We give explicit representation for all dynamical variables in the
bases of compactly supported wavelets or nonlinear eigenmodes. Our solutions
are parametrized by the solutions of a number of reduced standard algebraic
problems.

2.2 Rate Equations

we have obvious equations for root-mean-square beam radius R(s)

(24)

and unnormalized beam emittance

ε2(s) = 4(< x′2 + y′2 >< x2 + y2 > − < xx′ − yy′ >),

(28)

may be ﬁxed in some interesting cases, but generally we have it only as average

K(1 + ∆)/2 = − < x∂ψ/∂x + y∂ψ/∂y >

w.r.t. distribution F . Anyway, the rate equations represent reasonable reduc-
tions for the second-moments related quantities from the full nonlinear Vlasov-
Poisson system. For trivial distributions Davidson e.a.
[8] found additional
reductions. For KV distribution (step- function density) the second rate equa-
tion is trivial,

ε(s) = const

(29)

and we have only one nontrivial rate equation for rms beam radius. The ﬁxed-
shape density proﬁle ansatz for axisymmetric distributions also leads to similar
situation: emittance conservation and the same envelope equation with two
shifted constants only.

2.3 Multiscale Representation

Accordingly to our approach which allows us to ﬁnd exact solutions as for
Vlasov-like systems as for rms-like systems we need not to ﬁx particular case of
distribution function F (x, y, x′, y′, s). Our consideration is based on the follow-
ing multiscale N -mode anzatz:

F N (x, y, x′, y′, s) =

ai1,...,i5

Aik (x, y, x′, y′, s),

N

Xi1,...,i5=1

N

Xj1,j2,j3=1

5

Ok=1

3

Ok=1

ψN (x, y, s) =

bj1,j2,j3

Bjk (x, y, s).

These formulae provide multiresolution representation for variational solutions
of our system. Each high-localized mode/harmonics Aj (s) corresponds to level
j of resolution from the whole underlying inﬁnite scale of spaces:

. . . V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ . . . ,

(32)

where the closed subspace Vj (j ∈ Z) corresponds to level j of resolution, or
to scale j. The construction of tensor algebra based on the multiscale bases
is considered in part I [7]. We will consider rate equations as the following
operator equation. Let L, P , Q be an arbitrary nonlinear (rational in dynamical
variables) ﬁrst-order matrix diﬀerential operators with matrix dimension (d = 4
in our case) corresponding to the system of equations, which act on some set of
functions

Ψ ≡ Ψ(s) =

Ψ1(s), . . . , Ψd(s)

(cid:17)

,

s ∈ Ω ⊂ R

L2(Ω) : Q(R, s)Ψ(s) = P (R, s)Ψ(s)

from

or

where

Let us consider now the N mode approximation for solution as the following

expansion in some high-localized wavelet-like basis:

LΨ ≡ L(R, s)Ψ(s) = 0

R ≡ R(s, ∂/∂s, Ψ).

ΨN (s) =

aN
r φr(s).

N

Xr=1

We will determine the coeﬃcients of expansion from the following variational
condition:

LN

k ≡

Z

(LΨN )φk(s)ds = 0

We have exactly dN algebraic equations for dN unknowns ar. So, variational
approach reduced the initial problem to the problem of solution of functional

(44)

equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraic problems at the second stage.
As a result we have the following reduced algebraic system of equations (RSAE)
on the set of unknown coeﬃcients aN

i of the expansion:

H(Qij, aN

i , αI ) = M (Pij, aN

i , βJ ),

where operators H and M are algebraization of RHS and LHS of initial problem.
Qij (Pij ) are the coeﬃcients of LHS (RHS) of the initial system of diﬀerential
equations and as consequence are coeﬃcients of RSAE (39).

I = (i1, ..., iq+2),

J = (j1, ..., jp+1)

are multiindices, by which are labelled αI and βI , the other coeﬃcients of RSAE:

βJ = {βj1...jp+1} =

Z Y1≤jk≤p+1

φjk ,

where p is the degree of polynomial operator

αI = {αi1...αiq+2 } =

φi1 ... ˙φis ...φiq+2 ,

(42)

Xi1,...,iq+2

Z

where q is the degree of polynomial operator Q,

iℓ = (1, ..., q + 2),

˙φis = dφis /ds.

We may extend our approach to the case when we have additional constraints
on the set of our dynamical variables

Ψ = {R, ε}

and additional averaged terms also. In this case by using the method of La-
grangian multipliers we again may apply the same approach but for the extended
set of variables. As a result we receive the expanded system of algebraic equa-
tions analogous to our system. Then, after reduction we again can extract from
its solution the coeﬃcients of the expansion. It should be noted that if we con-
sider only truncated expansion with N terms then we have the system of N × d
algebraic equations with the degree

ℓ = max{p, q}

(45)

and the degree of this algebraic system coincides with the degree of the initial
system. So, after all we have the solution of the initial nonlinear (rational)
problem in the form

RN (s) = R(0) +

aN
k φk(s),

εN (s) = ε(0) +

bN
k φk(s),

(46)

N

Xk=1

N

Xk=1

10

where coeﬃcients

aN
k ,

bN
k

αI ,

βJ

are the roots of the corresponding reduced algebraical (polynomial) problem
RSAE. Consequently, we have a parametrization of the solution of the initial
problem by solution of reduced algebraic problem. The problem of computations
of coeﬃcients

of reduced algebraical system may be explicitly solved in wavelet approach.
The obtained solutions are given in the form, where φk(s) are proper wavelet
bases functions (e.g., periodic or boundary). It should be noted that such rep-
resentations give the best possible localization properties in the corresponding
(phase)space/time coordinates. In contrast with diﬀerent approaches these for-
mulae do not use perturbation technique or linearization procedures and repre-
sent dynamics via generalized nonlinear localized eigenmodes expansion. Our
N mode construction gives the following general multiscale representation:

(47)

(48)

R(s) = Rslow

N (s) +

Ri(ωis), ωi ∼ 2i,

(49)

ε(s) = εslow

N (s) +

εj(ωjs), ωj ∼ 2j,

Xi≥N

Xj≥N

where Ri(s), εj(s) are represented by some family of (nonlinear) eigenmodes
and gives the full multiresolution/multiscale representation in the high-localized
wavelet bases. As a result we can construct various unstable (Fig. 10, Part I)
or stable patterns (Fig. 1, 2 , Part II and Fig. 11, Part I) from high-localized
(coherent) fundamental modes (Fig. 1 or 8 or 9 from Part I) in complicated
stochastic systems with complex collective behaviour. Deﬁnitely, partition(s)
as generic dynamical variables cannot be postulated but need to be computed
as solutions of proper stochastic dynamical evolution model. Only after that,
it is possible to calculate other dynamical quantities and physically interesting
averages.

3 CONCLUSIONS: TOWARDS ENERGY

CONFINEMENT

Analysis and modeling considered in these two Parts describes, in principle,
a scenario for the generation of controllable localized (meta) stable fusion-like
state (Fig. 2 and Fig. 6). Deﬁnitely, chaotic-like unstable partitions/states
dominate during non-equilibrium evolution. It means that (possible) localized
(meta) stable partitions have measure equal to zero a.e. on the full space of
hierarchy of partitions deﬁned on a domain of the deﬁnition in the whole phase
space. Nevertheless, our Generalized Dispersion Relations, like (15) or (39),
give some chance to build the controllable localized state (Fig. 6) starting from

11

initial chaotic-like partition (Fig. 3) via process of controllable self-organization.
Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate two subsequent steps towards creation important
fusion or conﬁnement state, Fig. 6, which can be characterized by the presence
of a few important physical modes only in contrast with the opposite, chaotic-
like state, Fig. 3, described by inﬁnite number of important modes. Of course,
such conﬁnement states, characterized by zero measure and minimum entropy,
can be only metastable. But these long-living ﬂuctuations can and must be very
important from the practical point of view, because the averaged time of exis-
tence of such states may be even more than needed for practical realization, e.g.,
in controllable fusion processes. Further details will be considered elsewhere.

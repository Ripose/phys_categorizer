Abstract

The energy of the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld is bounded from below
by a topological quantity expressing the degree of linkage of the ﬁeld
lines. When the bound is saturated one can assume that the storage
of a certain magnetic energy requires a minimal degree of topologi-
cal complexity. It is then possible to infer a connection between the
helicity content and the average curvature of the magnetic ﬁeld lines.
The random curvature induce random drifts leading to an additional
dissipation and modiﬁed resistivity.

1 Introduction

When the Chirikov criterion is veriﬁed for several chains of magnetic is-
lands (developing at closely neighbor resonant magnetic surfaces in a volume
of plasma) the magnetic ﬁeld becomes stochastic. In general the magnetic
stochasticity is taken into account in transport processes due to the high
eﬃciency of energy spreading through the stochastic region. However from
the point of view of the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld it is diﬃcult to say
anything more than we know from Hamiltonian chaotic systems: there is
a stochastic (exponential) instability, local Lyapunov exponents and Kol-
mogorov length and the test particles move diﬀusively or have various sub-
and supra-diﬀusive behaviors.

However in a stochastic region the ﬁeld must still obey some constraints.
These constraints arise from the relation between the energy stored in the

1

magnetic ﬁeld and the topological complexity of the ﬁeld. The constraints
can be brieﬂy expressed in this way: it is not possible to support a certain
energy in a volume spanned by transiently stochastic magnetic ﬁeld lines if
these magnetic ﬁeld lines do not have a certain minimal degree of topological
complexity.

This should be seen in relation with the equation that expresses the topo-
logical link in terms of writhe and twist and in relation with the dynamics of
a twisted ﬂux tube. If an initial amount of link is stored exclusively as twist,
then beyond a certain level of twist the ﬂux tube deforms and acquires writhe,
thus distributing the higher amount of link into the two kinds of topologi-
cal deformations: twist and writhe. In a plasma free from strong magnetic
background (as in astrophysical plasma or solar corona) generation of writhe
means a coiling or super-coiling instability, a large spatial deformation. In a
tokamak the stochastic ﬂux tubes are also subject to the writhing instabil-
ity when a local ﬂuctuation of the parallel electric ﬁeld occurs, but they are
more constraint by the conﬁning B0 and cannot perform large spatial dis-
placements. Instead, as a result of small deformations originating from local
writhing (coiling) instability, they will reconnect such that, from elements
of tubes, eﬀectively new strings are created, with a new eﬀective entangle-
ment.
It is reasonable to assume that these new, episodic, ﬂux tubes, by
their mutual linking, satisfy on the average the energy-topology constraints.
Therefore we will assume that the ﬁeld ﬂux tubes inside the stochastic re-
gion will reconnect to generate transiently conﬁgurations that exhibit a cer-
tain topological entanglement. Together with the dynamical nature of the
stochasticity phenomena, the formation of these entangled structures is tran-
sient and we may suppose that the higher topological content results from
a statistical average. At large time the topological reduction occurs with
suppression of relative linking via tube merging, a process called by Parker
topological dissipation [1].

2 Energy and topology of divergenceless vec-

tor ﬁelds

For two curves γ1 and γ2, the link invariant is given by the formula (Gauss)

Lk (γ1, γ2) =

1
4π Iγ1

dxµ

dyνεµνρ

Iγ2

(x − y)ρ

|x − y|

(1)

This is an integer number and represents the relative entanglement of two
magnetic lines in the stochastic region. If a line closes in itself (as a magnetic

n with

line on a resonant surface in tokamak), the formula can still be applied, giving
n a versor
the self-linking. It is obtained by taking γ1 ≡ γ, γ2 ≡ γ + ε
perpendicular to the tangent of γ, and taking the limit ε → 0 (this operation
is called framing). However for a ﬂux tube a more complex situation arises:
the magnetic ﬁeld in the tube has the lines twisted relative to the axis and
the topological description is given in terms of the twist invariant.
It is
calculated by considering a line on the surface of the tube and the axis of
the tube and deﬁning the vectors: T (s), the tangent to the axis of the tube;
U (s), the versor from the current point on the axis toward the current point
on the line; s is the length along the axis. Then the twist is deﬁned as

The deformation of the ﬂux tube of axis γ relative to the plane is measured

by the topological number writhe, deﬁned as

W r (γ) =

Iγ

(x − y)ρ

|x − y|

While the twist measures the rate at which a line twists around the axis of
the tube, the writhe measures the rate at which the axis of the tube is twisted
in space. The following relation exists between the three basic topological
numbers for a ﬂux tube

Lk = T w + W r

Instead of generalizing Lk to an arbitrary but ﬁnite number of curves
(magnetic lines) in space, it is deﬁned an equivalent topological quantity
(also noted Lk) which refers this time to a vector ﬁeld in the volume. Instead
of the Gauss link (a discrete set of curves) the deﬁnition will now imply a
continuous, ﬁeld-like invariant, the Chern-Simons action, which is the total
helicity. For a divergenceless vector ﬁeld ξ (velocity or magnetic ﬁeld) in R3
the helicity is deﬁned as

H (ξ) =

d3x

ξ, curl−1ξ

ZM

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

which is the same as the integral of v · ω or A · B over volume. Consider two
narrow, linked ﬂux tubes of the vector ﬁeld ξ, γ1 and γ2. Then

H (ξ) = 2Lk (γ1, γ2) · |f lux1| · |f lux2|

which shows that the link of the magnetic ﬂux tubes is a measure of the
magnetic helicity in the volume. The total helicity in the volume is the

integral of the Chern-Simons form and with adequate boundary conditions
this is an integer number, a direct consequence of the topological nature of
the link invariant (invariance refers here to deformations of the ﬁeld ξ (≡ B)
that do not break and reconnect the lines)

Q =

1
32π2 Z

d3xεjklFjkAl

(7)

P

where Al is the magnetic potential and Fjk is the electromagnetic stress ten-
sor. The integrand is the Chern-Simons form, or helicity density, for the
magnetic ﬁeld. The integer Q is called the Hopf invariant. The magnetic
lines of a ﬁeld B or the streamlines of a ﬂow v are obtained form equations
dxi/Bi = 0, generally diﬃcult to solve. Therefore using these solu-
like
tions to construct topological invariants is very diﬃcult and we would need
a diﬀerent representation of the lines for easier handling. This is provided
by the Skyrme-Faddeev model, or the modiﬁed O (3) nonlinear sigma model,
where a line is a topological soliton, clearly exhibiting topological proper-
ties (see Ward [2]). It is very suggestive that this model has recently been
derived precisely starting from the plasma of electrons and ions, coupled to
electromagnetic ﬁeld (Faddeev and Niemi [3]). It is then legitimate to use the
general results derived for the Skyrme-Faddeev model and in particular the
following lower bound for the energy of the magnetic ﬁeld. The inequality is
E ≥ ηQ3/4

(8)

where η is a constant. It means that the energy is bounded from below by
the 3/4-th power of the total helicity content in the volume or by a quantity
that contains the total linking of magnetic lines in the volume, at the power
3/4.

A more practical measure of the topological content is the average crossing
number C, obtained for a pair of lines by summing the signed intersections
in the plane-projection of the spatial curves, averaged over all directions of
projection.
It diﬀers of Eq.(3) by taking the absolute value of the mixed
product. Friedmann and He [4] have extended the concept for a continuous
ﬁeld. We follow the argument of Berger [5] to ﬁnd the energy bound E ≥
const C 2.

Consider magnetic ﬂux tubes whose ends are tied to points situated in
two parallel planes (at distance L) and are linked one with the others. Taking
two points on their axis, we connect them with a line and measure the angle
formed by this line with a ﬁxed direction in one of the plane of projection.
This quantity is θ12. The crossing number can be expressed using this angle

(13)

We now have two inequalities implying the energy of the magnetic ﬁeld
in a region and two measures of the topological content in that volume: one
is the linking of the magnetic lines, or equivalently, the helicity H, and the
other is a more geometrical characterization of the entanglement, the average
crossing number, C.

Taking the inequalities as saturated we can estimate the total average

crossing number for a certain amount of helicity H in the volume

C ∼ H 3/8

(14)

The next step is to connect the crossing number with geometrical proper-
ties of a generic magnetic ﬁeld line. For a magnetic ﬁeld line γ the topological
quantity crossing number C can be estimated from the number Ω (γ) of in-
tersections of the line γ with an arbitrary surface. There is a general theorem
that allows to estimate this number as

2πΩ (γ) ∼ 4K1 + 3K2

(15)

5

where K1,2 are integrals of Frenet curvatures. Taking |K| as the upper esti-
mation of the local value of the curvature along γ, we have

where L is the length of the tube. Then we have

C ∼ Ω (γ) ∼ L |K|

|K| ∼ H 3/8

(16)

(17)

These very qualitative estimations led us to a scaling law connecting the
average of the local curvature of a typical magnetic ﬁeld line with the helicity
inside the ﬁnite volume of the stochastic region. A magnetic line is curved
since it is linked with other lines, and this link is generated for the magnetic
structure to be able to store the energy in a stochastic region. Generation of
linking also occurs when a certain amount of helicity is injected in a plasma
volume. It is reasonable to assume that the curvature is distributed randomly
in the volume.

3 Eﬀects of topology on resistivity and diﬀu-

sion

The curvature of magnetic ﬂux tubes induces drifts of particles. Electrons
and ions ﬂowing along curved magnetic lines will have opposite drifts and
local charge separations produce random transversal electric ﬁelds. For a
ﬁnite collisionality this is a source of additional dissipation. The equation

In general it is assumed that the magnetic reconnection does not aﬀect
the total helicity. However there is a dynamic redistribution of helicity (with

overall conservation) since in the stochastic region there are ﬁlaments of
current and local increase of the parallel electric ﬁeld, from which we have
dh/dt = −2E · B. Then this mechanism is a potential feedback loop: higher
resistivity leads to higher reconnection rate and higher helicity perturbation,
which in turn creates magnetic linking and curvature.

In an alternative approach to the problem of topology of the magnetic
ﬁeld in a stochastic region, we can base our estimations on the much simpler
assumption, that a magnetic line is randomly “scattered” at equal space
(z) intervals and performs a random walk. Actually this is the classical
assumption for the diﬀusion in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds. To characterize
quantitatively the topology of the line we use the analogy with the polymer
entanglement. A functional integral formalism can be developed (Tanaka [6])
taking as action the free random walk, with the constraint that the line has a
ﬁxed, m, winding number around a reference straight line. The mean square
dispersion of the winding number (linking) can then be calculated

(ln N)

(20)

where N is the number of steps. Since kk is low for magnetic turbulence, the
winding number is a small number. But this represents the random winding
naturally occuring in an unconstrained random walk of the magnetic line,
when the magnetic perturbation is a Gaussian noise. Actually, we know that
a given amount of helicity can only be realised by a certain volume-averaged
mutual linking and this is an eﬀective constraint which can only be realised
hm2i than the free random motion. Then
through a much higher density of
the higher winding leads to a sort of trapping for the magnetic lines and the
eﬀective diﬀusion will be smaller that for the brownian case [7].

In general the use of topological quantities can improve the description of
stochastic magnetic ﬁelds, e.g. diﬀusion, Kolmogorov length, etc. These are
usually expressed in terms of mean square amplitude of the perturbation,

Consider the line γ of a perturbed magnetic ﬁeld and the equation Du = 0
where D is the covariant derivative, similar to the velocity, v = p−A which is
applied on a function u along the line γ. The equation says that the covariant
derivative along the line, of the function u is zero. Then
u = 0

leads to u = u0 exp

the two-dimensional concept of point-like vortices and introduce the spinors

we will need the dual (dotted-indices) spinors and we need to represent A in

Wilson loop.

We subject the ﬂuctuations of the potential A to the constraint of min-
imum helicity in the volume, because lower helicity allows lower energy ac-
cording to the bound Eq.(8). The Boltzmann weight in the partition function
is then the exponential of an action representing the total helicity, i.e. the

Calculating Lk=self-linking of the curve γ, the classical relation is obtained
between the link, the twist and the writhe Lk (γ) = T w (γ) + W r (γ).

Therefore if the ﬂuctuation of the poloidal ﬂux function ψ, or the z-
component of the magnetic potential Az are such that higher helicity states
are diﬃcult to access, then the two-point correlations of the perturbed po-
tential along a curve γ can be expressed as the kernel of the Gauss integral
for the self-linking number of γ. The result

possibly sheds a new light on the correlations of ﬂuctuating magnetic quan-
tities, since we now express them also by topological quantities.

4 Discussion

We have examined the topological constraints on the stochastic magnetic
conﬁguration when a transient increase of helicity occurs in a ﬁnite plasma
volume. Via bounds related to the magnetic energy that can be safely stored
in that volume (i.e. a statistical stationarity can be attained) a scaling
can be derived between the helicity and the average curvature of a generic
magnetic line in the volume. The particles’ curvature-drift-induced new dis-
sipation appears to not modify substantially the resistivity. However the
new instruments that imply the topology of magnetic ﬁeld are useful : the
average dispersion of the winding of a line relative to a reference axis serves
to quantify the trapping of a line and the reduction of the classical magnetic
diﬀusion.

We note ﬁnally that using these analytical instruments the topological
dissipation process may be described by the coupling of the magnetic helicity
density (the Chern-Simons Lagrangian density) with a pseudoscalar ﬁeld.
The dynamics of this ﬁeld is that of the kinematic helicity of the plasma and
again a ﬁeld-theoretical description appears to be possible.

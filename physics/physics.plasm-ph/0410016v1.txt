Abstract. While ion heating by elastic electron-ion collisions may be neglected
for a description of the evolution of freely expanding ultracold neutral plasmas, the
situation is diﬀerent in scenarios where the ions are laser-cooled during the system
evolution. We show that electron-ion collisions in laser-cooled plasmas inﬂuence the
ionic temperature, decreasing the degree of correlation obtainable in such systems.
However, taking into account the collisions increases the ion temperature much less
than what would be estimated based on static plasma clouds neglecting the plasma
expansion. The latter leads to both adiabatic cooling of the ions as well as, more
importantly, a rapid decrease of the collisional heating rate.

Recently, the ﬁeld of ultracold (T

1K) neutral plasmas and Rydberg gases has
attracted attention both experimentally [1, 2, 3] and theoretically [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. One of
the motivations of the experiments [1, 10] is the creation of a so-called strongly coupled
plasma, where the Coulomb coupling parameter Γi = e2/(akBTi) is much larger than
unity (where a = (4πρi/3)−1/3 is the Wigner-Seitz radius and Ti is the temperature of
the ions). In such a case, interesting ordering eﬀects such as Coulomb crystallization
into cubic or shell-structure lattices can be observed. In the experiments [1] strongly
coupled ions can not be observed since the temperature of the initially cold ions rises
quickly on the timescale of the inverse ionic plasma frequency ω−1
mi/ (4πe2ρi)
due to disorder-induced heating [4, 6, 7]. Diﬀerent ways to overcome this heating eﬀect
have been proposed [4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In [12, 13], e.g., it has been suggested that
continuous laser cooling during the plasma expansion may considerably increase the
achievable Coulomb coupling parameter of the ions.

Using a hybrid molecular dynamics approach [16], we have predicted that Coulomb
crystallization in an unconﬁned ultracold neutral plasma can indeed be obtained if the
plasma ions are laser-cooled during the evolution of the system [14]. In this theoretical
approach, the electronic component of the plasma is treated as a ﬂuid while ions and
recombined atoms are described on a full molecular dynamics level. More precisely, an
adiabatic approximation is made for the electrons, which are assumed to be distributed
according to the mean-ﬁeld potential generated by ions and electrons, calculated in a
self-consistent way. Their velocity distribution is assumed to be of Michie-King-type
[17] which takes into account deviations of the quasi-equilibrium state from a Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution due to the ﬁnite depth of the potential well generated by the
ions. The latter leads to an evaporation of a fraction of the electrons in the initial stage
immediately after the plasma formation, which is taken into account using the results
of [1]. The ions, on the other hand, are propagated under the inﬂuence of all other ions
and the electronic mean-ﬁeld. Finally, inelastic collisions, i.e. three-body recombination,
electron-impact ionization and electron-impact (de)excitation, are included on the basis
of a Monte Carlo treatment. Elastic electron-ion collisions, however, are neglected in
this approach, as in other approaches for the description of ultracold plasmas [18].

This neglect of elastic electron-ion collisions in the dynamics is well justiﬁed for
the description of freely expanding ultracold plasmas as created in [1] because of a clear
separation of timescales. Due to the large mass ratio between ions and electrons, the time
necessary for equilibration of the electron and ion temperature is typically of the order of
a few milliseconds, while the plasma expansion takes place on a microsecond timescale.
Hence, elastic electron-ion collisions only increase the ion temperature by some milli-
Kelvin during the experimental observation time [1]. This amount of heating is negligible
compared to the initial temperature increase due to disorder-induced heating, which
rises the ion temperature to about one Kelvin. Hence, the time evolution of the ion
temperature which enters Γi and determines the degree of coupling of the ions is mainly
determined by this disorder-induced heating.

However, this situation changes in the scenario of [14], where additional laser cooling

of the ions compensates the disorder-induced heating and keeps the ionic temperature on
a milli-Kelvin level. In this case, the ion temperature is not only increased by electron-
ion collisions, but is also driven to the Doppler temperature, i.e. the limiting temperature
Tc for laser cooling, due to the coupling to the radiation ﬁeld. The ﬁnal ion temperature
is now determined by the balance between the collisional heating rate and the laser-
cooling rate [12, 13]. Since Tc is typically of the order of one milli-Kelvin, i.e. of the
same order of magnitude as the amount of collisional heating, the ion temperature may
considerably increase through electron-ion collisions. Thus, electron-ion collisions could
signiﬁcantly decrease the Coulomb coupling parameter achievable by laser-cooling of
expanding ultracold neutral plasmas. In the following, the inﬂuence of such collisions on
the onset of Coulomb crystallization during the plasma expansion is critically reassessed.
The system under study is the same as that of [14], namely an unconﬁned, ultracold
neutral plasma under the additional inﬂuence of a cooling laser. The plasma is treated
on the basis of the hybrid-MD method outlined above and described in detail in [16].

Laser cooling is modelled by adding a Langevin force, Fcool =
to the ion equation of motion, where vi is the ion velocity, ξ is a stochastic variable with
ξ

temperature Tc are determined by the properties of the cooling laser [19]. The weak
electron coupling, which justiﬁes our hybrid treatment of the plasma dynamics, also
allows us to describe electron-ion collisions with a Boltzmann-type collision operator, as
we shall discuss below. The implementation of electron-ion collisions is very similiar to
the treatment of electron-electron collisions used in [18] and has been introduced before
in [20]. For an ion at position ri with velocity vi, the rate of electron-ion collisions is

Hence, Peic = ∆t Keic is the probability that a collision will occur during a timestep

chosen randomly according to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with temperature Te.

the random direction of the momentum transfer chosen uniformly on the unit sphere.
Finally, energy conservation is restored by adjusting the electronic temperature Te.

As mentioned above, the derivation of equation (2) implies the limit me/mi
0.
In this case, individual collision events satisfy momentum conservation, but energy
conservation is violated and has to be corrected manually by adjusting the electron
temperature. The error introduced by this approximation can be shown to be of the
order of the temperature ratio Ti/Te [23]. Hence, as long as the ionic temperature is small
compared to the electronic temperature, which is the case over the whole time of the
experiments under consideration, the corresponding corrections can be neglected. The
method described above thus allows for an eﬃcient simulation of electron-ion collisions
without the need for time-consuming transformations between laboratory and center-
of-mass coordinate systems.

In order to check the inﬂuence of elastic electron-ion collisions on the plasma
dynamics, we have simulated the expansion of a plasma with an initial electronic
Coulomb coupling parameter of Γe(t = 0) = Γe0 = 0.05, consisting of 20000 Be

in ﬁgure 1,
the inclusion of elastic electron-ion collisions signiﬁcantly reduces the
ionic coupling parameter which can be achieved in this case. However, the value Γi

[24] for crystallization. The good agreement found between the distribution of interionic
distances, calculated as described in [14], and the pair-correlation function of a one-
component plasma at Γi = 400 [25] also conﬁrms that the system evolves well into the
strongly coupled regime (ﬁgure 2). We note here that Debye shielding of the ion-ion
interaction, which is not included in the present considerations, tends to increase the
crystallization limit. However, as shown in [26], even for a comparably large electron
coupling of Γe = 0.2 the crystallization limit is increased to Γi,c
198 only, hence the
inclusion of Debye screening does not signiﬁcantly alter the results obtained with the
present model.

In fact, the simulation results show that the ﬁnal Γi is much larger than what
one would expect from a static estimate by equating the heating γeicTe resulting from
electron-ion collisions to the cooling 2β(Ti

their numerical results are reproduced by equation (6) to within 10%. Moreover,
collective eﬀects, which largely decrease the relaxation rate at strong coupling [29], were
found to be negligible even for arbitrarily strong ion-ion coupling, as long as the electron-
ion coupling is weak and the resonance of the ion excitation spectrum lies far below that
of the electrons [30]. Therefore, under the present conditions, which correspond to the
parameter regime studied in [30], the Monte Carlo treatment described above yields an
adequate description of the electron-ion temperature relaxation process.

In order to trace the origin of this discrepancy, we have performed a second set of
simulations. In one simulation, we have set the Doppler temperature Tc equal to zero
and have turned oﬀ the initial correlation-induced heating of the ions by propagating
them in the framework of a particle-in-cell method [18], i.e. on a mean-ﬁeld level, rather
than by a full MD simulation. By doing this, only the competition between the laser
cooling, the heating by electron-ion collisions, and the adiabatic expansion determines
the evolution of the ion temperature. In the second type of simulation, Tc is also set
to zero and all particle interactions except the binary electron-ion collisions causing the

ion heating are neglected, which results in a basically static ionic density
§

The resulting time evolution of the ionic temperature for a plasma of 100000 ions
107 cm−3, Γe0 = 0.08 and β = 0.15 ωp,i(t = 0) is shown in ﬁgure 3. In the
with ρi0 = 2
static case (dashed line in ﬁgure 3), the temperature shows an initial linear rise with
a slope corresponding to the collisional heating rate γeicTe and then quickly saturates
to a value which is well described by equation (7) (marked by the arrow in the ﬁgure).
However, in the case of an expanding plasma (solid line in ﬁgure 3) the temperature
is drastically reduced. While the initial rise of the ion temperature stays the same,
the temperature starts to drop down already at a relatively early time, which at this
stage is mainly caused by adiabatic cooling of the ions due to the plasma expansion. At
later times, the ion temperature is driven to its steady-state value given by the balance
between the collisional heating and the laser cooling (equation (7)). The long-time
behaviour of the ionic temperature can be estimated from the plasma dynamics discussed
in [14], where it was found that laser cooling strongly alters the expansion behaviour,
t1/4. It was also shown
leading to an increase of the plasma width σ according to σ
there that the adiabatic law for the selfsimilar plasma expansion, σ2Te = const., still
holds, which gives together with equation (7) for Tc

while the ionic Coulomb coupling parameter increases according to Γi
As can be seen in the inset of ﬁgure 3, equation (9) is well reproduced by the numerical
simulation. Hence, it is indeed this adiabatic cooling of the expanding plasma together
with a decreasing collisional heating rate γeicTe which leads to much lower temperatures
and consequently to much larger Coulomb coupling parameters than those predicted by
a static estimate.

The simulations described above demonstrate that electron-ion collisions do not
prohibit achieving ionic Coulomb coupling parameters above the crystallization limit.
However, for a given set of initial-state parameters, Γi can be signiﬁcantly reduced by
collisional heating during the plasma evolution, leading to an additional restriction of
the initial-state parameters for which strongly coupled states can be achieved. Since
it was found that the degree of spatial order in the system sensitively depends on
initial conditions such as number of ions, electron temperature etc., one may wonder
whether the long-range ordering into shell structures described in [14] is still observable
in simulations taking into account the electron-ion collisions. This is demonstrated in
107 cm−3 and Γe0 = 0.08,
ﬁgure 4 for a plasma of 50000 ions with a density of ρi0 = 2
cooled with a damping rate of 0.17ωp,i(t = 0) and a limiting temperature of Tc = 0.8mK.
The ordering into concentric shells is clearly visible in the radial density after a time of
t = 175 µs.

plasmas including elastic electron-ion collisions.
It is found that these collisions can
have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the ﬁnal ionic temperature, and hence the degree of
correlation, achievable under given experimental conditions. Yet, with a proper choice
of initial conditions rather large Coulomb coupling parameters can still be achieved.
As we have shown, this is due to the fact that the expansion of the plasma drastically
reduces the ion temperature, due to adiabatic cooling of the ions as well as a decreasing
heating rate during the course of the plasma evolution. Therefore, the resulting Coulomb
coupling parameters are much larger than one would expect from static estimates as in
[12, 13]. We thus conclude that our predictions made in [14] about the possibility to
observe Coulomb crystallization in such a system remain valid. In particular, we have
shown here that the electron-ion collisions do not preclude the build-up of long-range
order and the formation of the shell structures predicted in [14]. The experimental
realizability of the discussed scheme has been demonstrated recently in [10]. There, the
ion temperature of an ultracold Strontium plasma has been measured by driving the core
transition of the plasma ions during the gas expansion. Since the same transition which
allowed for Doppler imaging can be used to cool the ions, these experiments provide the
ﬁrst step towards a realization of strongly coupled ultracold plasmas in the laboratory.
We would like to thank T.C. Killian and F. Robicheaux for valuable discussions
and for drawing our attention to the importance of electron-ion collisions. Financial

Abstract. The magnetic ﬁeld generation by a relativistic laser light irradiated on a
thin target at the oblique incidence is investigated using a two dimensional particle-
in-cell simulation. The surface magnetic ﬁeld inhibits the electron transport towards
the inside plasma, when an incident angle exceeds the critical angle, which depends on
the laser and plasma parameters.

1. Introduction

Laser plasma interaction in the relativistic regime, where the normalized vector potential
2
µ/1.37 × 1018)1/2 ≥ 1, where IL and λµ are the laser intensity in W/cm
aL ≃ (ILλ2
and the wavelength in µm, respectively, is crucial for inertial fusion energy with the
fast ignitor scheme [1], multi-MeV proton, and electron generation.
In particular,
the generation of magnetic ﬁelds during intense laser solid target interactions have
attracted much interest for the past 30 years [2–4]. The magnetic ﬁelds are generated by
various mechanisms, which are the currents produced from perpendicular density and
temperature gradients in the ablated plasma [2], the radiation pressure associated with
the laser pulse itself [3], the current of fast electrons generated during the interaction,
and the Weibel instability [4]. Recently, self-generated magnetic ﬁelds, whose amplitudes
are of the order of a few hundred mega gauss, have been observed in the overdense region
of an irradiated solid target by a relativistic laser irradiation [5].

The self-generated magnetic ﬁelds can play a signiﬁcant role in laser absorption [7]
and transport of high energy particles in dense plasmas [8]. In addition, at the oblique
incidence, the magnetic ﬁelds is localized on the plasma surface, which depth is less
than a laser wavelength and amplitude is about one third of the laser electromagnetic
ﬁeld [9–12]. The magnetic ﬁeld associated with a intense laser with intensity IL is
]/1019) MG, namely, the amplitudes are greater
extremely large, BL = 290 × (IL[W/cm
than 100 MG. The generation of three kinds of quasistatic magnetic ﬁelds, which are

located at the front surface, inner plasma, and rear surface in the interaction of ultrashort
intense laser pulses with thin solid targets are reported in the previous paper [12]. First
magnetic ﬁeld which is located on a front surface arises very quickly, of which raising time
is almost the same of the laser raising time. Second magnetic ﬁeld is gradually growth
in a inner plasma by the Weibel instability, which occurs between the fast electrons
generated by the vacuum heating and their return currents. Final magnetic ﬁeld that
is located on the rear surface of the thin target arises also very quickly when electrons
pass through the surface and return into the plasma.

In the present paper, the magnetic ﬁeld generation at the oblique incidence is
investigated by a two dimensional particle-in-cell (2D PIC) simulation. We discuss the
generation of the magnetic ﬁeld and the electron transport inhibition due to the surface
magnetic ﬁeld. The surface magnetic ﬁeld inhibits the electron transport towards a
inside plasma, when an incident angle exceeds the critical angle, which depends on the
laser and plasma parameters.

2. 2D PIC simulation

We use the 2D PIC simulation with immobile ions. The schematic is shown in Fig 1.
The plasma density ne = 1.12 × 1022cm−3, which corresponds to ne/nc = 10, where
nc is the critical density for λ = 1µm, and the initial temperature is 5 keV. The laser
intensity rises in 5 fs and remains constant after that. The peak irradiated intensity
I = 1 × 1019W/cm
, which corresponds to a ≃ 2.7. The amplitude of magnetic ﬁeld
associated with a intense laser BL = 290 MG. In order to study the diﬀerence in the
magnetic ﬁelds of the incident angles, we simulate three incident angles θ = 20◦, 60◦
and 75◦, respectively. The number of spatial grids and particles are 2048 × (416 − 1184)
and (4 − 11) × 106, respectively. The simulation sizes depend on the incident angles.
In the simulations, all incident waves are p-polarized. The eﬀects of the polarization
have been studied in the previous paper [12]. The structures of the magnetic ﬁeld of
the s-polarized light are the same as that of the p-polarized light. The amplitude of the
s-polarized light is less than 1/10 of the p-polarized light.

The quasistatic magnetic ﬁelds eBz after 50 fs for incident angles θ = 20◦, 60◦, and
75◦ are shown in Figs. 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c), respectively. The quasistatic magnetic
ﬁeld is obtained by averaging over a laser period and the amplitude is normalized by
that of the laser magnetic ﬁeld. We ﬁnd three kinds of quasistatic magnetic ﬁelds,
which are located at the front and rear surfaces and inside plasma, for θ = 20◦ and
60◦, as discussed in the previous paper. The normalized amplitude inner plasma is
about one third of the laser electromagnetic ﬁeld. This amplitude is well in agreement
with Ref. [6]. The normalized amplitude at the front surface for θ = 60◦ is about half,
namely, eBz ≃ 150MG. For θ = 75◦, three kinds of quasistatic magnetic ﬁelds are also
observed. However, the amplitude of magnetic ﬁeld inside the plasma is about 1/10 of
the others. The reason of this small value is that the surface magnetic ﬁeld inhibits the
electron transport into the plasma and restricts the electron motion of the low energies

3

at the surface. Since the restriction to the high energy electrons by the magnetic ﬁeld is
weak compared with the low energy ones, on the rear surface the magnetic ﬁeld of the
same kind as what was generated at an angle of others is generated by the high energy
electrons.

3. Concluding Remarks

The magnetic ﬁeld generation by the relativistic laser light irradiated on a thin target
at the oblique incidence is investigated using a 2D PIC simulation code. We reconﬁrm
the generation of the three kinds of quasistatic magnetic ﬁelds, which are located at
the front and rear surfaces and inside plasma, for all incident angles of the simulation,
as discussed in the previous paper [12]. However, the amplitudes are strongly depend
on the incident angles. We ﬁnd that the surface magnetic ﬁeld inhibits the electron
transport into the plasma and restricts the electron motion of the low energies at the
surface for θ = 75◦. When the incident angle is larger than a certain critical angle,
a magnetic ﬁeld will restrict a electron motion strongly. The existence of the critical
angle, which restricts the electron transport, is well consistent with the theory [11].

The low-frequency electric microﬁeld distribution in a Coulomb plasma is calculated for various
plasma parameters, from weak to strong Coulomb coupling and from zero to strong electron screen-
ing. Two methods of numerical calculations are employed: the adjustable-parameter exponential
approximation and the Monte Carlo simulation. The results are represented by analytic ﬁtting
formulas suitable for applications.

INTRODUCTION

Because of the Stark eﬀect, stochastic electric mi-
croﬁelds inﬂuence optical and thermodynamic properties
of a plasma. First, they aﬀect the proﬁles of spectral
lines and eﬀectively lower photoionization thresholds of
atoms and ions immersed in a plasma [1, 2]. A compar-
ison of experimental and theoretical widths and shapes
of the Stark-broadened spectral lines is widely used for
plasma diagnostics (e.g., Refs. [3, 4]). Second, in some
theoretical models of the plasma equation of state (e.g.,
Refs. [5, 6]), the microﬁeld distribution is used in order
to calculate occupation numbers of the bound species (al-
though such a calculation is not free from principal dif-
ﬁculties, as discussed in Ref. [7]). It was shown recently
[6] that a more accurate description of the microﬁelds en-
tails a considerable improvement of the equation-of-state
model.

In many cases, the microﬁeld perturbation can be
treated as quasistationary. Then the problem is re-
duced to determination of the probability distribution of
the low-frequency component of perturbing electric ﬁelds
(e.g., Ref. [8]), associated with a stochastic distribution
of perturbing ions, whereas the electrons can be assumed
to adjust instantaneously to a conﬁguration of the ions.
The low-frequency microﬁelds are appropriate to use in
the equation of state models [6] and in calculation of
spectroscopic line proﬁles for those radiative transitions
whose frequency does not exceed the typical frequency of
microﬁelds produced by thermal ﬂuctuations of the elec-
tron density. For example, Stehl´e and Jacquemot [9] used
the model microﬁeld method to analyze the line shapes
and line dissolution in hydrogen plasma spectra.

Holtsmark [10] has derived the microﬁeld distribution
function assuming that the ions are not correlated and
the electron screening is negligible. This assumption is
justiﬁed for very hot or rareﬁed plasmas, for which the

perature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, a = ( 4π

is the ion sphere radius, ni is the ion number density, and
n20 is the electron number density (ne = Zni) in units
of 1020 cm−
3. As we demonstrate below, the Holtsmark
0.1. In mod-
approximation is inaccurate already at Γ
ern plasma experiments, Γ may approach unity, whereas
in stellar matter it can be much larger. In these cases,
correlations of plasma particles should not be neglected.
Various approximations were developed in the past in
order to take the ion correlations into account. If Γ . 1,
one may use the methods of Baranger and Mozer [11] or
Hooper [12, 13] based on a cluster expansion in powers
of density. The electron screening is usually described by
a Debye-like (Yukawa) eﬀective potential, introduced in
the context of microﬁeld distributions by Hoﬀman and
Theimer [14]. In the limit of extremely strong coupling,
Γ
10, and without screening, the harmonic oscillator
model by Mayer [15] is applicable, in which every ion is
assumed to oscillate independently of the others around
its equilibrium position at the ion-sphere center.

≫

The ﬁrst theory capable to provide reliable numerical
results for strongly coupled plasmas with electron screen-
ing proved to be the adjustable-parameter exponential
approximation (APEX), based on a special parametriza-
tion of the electric microﬁeld E produced on a selected
test particle (neutral or charged “radiator” of charge Zr)
which undergoes the inﬂuence of charged plasma parti-
cles (“perturbers” of species σ and of charge Zσ). This
method has been developed for Coulomb systems [16] and
adapted for screened Coulomb systems and ion mixtures

[8, 17].
It involves non-interacting quasiparticle repre-
sentation of the electron-screened ions, designed to yield
the correct second moment of the microﬁeld distribution

The expression on the left-hand side of this equation con-
to be determined, whereas
tains the parameters
the right-hand side can be evaluated using Eq. (2), if
the RDF is known. The RDF thus provides a scheme
for evaluating the APEX microﬁeld distribution and is
a central ingredient whose accuracy determines the one
of the APEX microﬁeld results. In our implementation
of the APEX technique, we have used the hypernetted-
chain RDF calculations [18, 19, 20].

On the other hand, with the advent of powerful com-
puters it is now possible to calculate the microﬁeld dis-
tribution from Monte Carlo (MC) or molecular-dynamics
simulations of plasmas with the minimum of simplify-
ing assumptions (e.g., Refs. [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]). More-
over, the latter methods allow one to study the eﬀects of
microﬁeld nonuniformity [26, 27] and to simulate high-
frequency microﬁeld distributions in electron-ion plasmas
(e.g., Ref. [28]). The MC technique is based on a numeri-
cal simulation of space conﬁgurations of a system of par-
ticles, whereas the molecular-dynamics technique traces
the time evolution of the system. For the low-frequency
microﬁeld, dynamical eﬀects are unimportant, and the
two methods yield the same results, as demonstrated,
e.g., in Ref. [27]. Therefore it is suﬃcient to use the MC
method in this case.

With these powerful tools, the microﬁeld distribution
can be calculated now for any practically important com-
bination of plasma parameters. However, plasma spec-
troscopy and equation-of-state models require knowledge
of this distribution at many diﬀerent points or even in
continuous areas of the plasma parameter space. In this
case, either extensive numerical tables or approximate
analytic expressions are necessary.

We present results of calculations of the low-frequency
microﬁeld distribution function at a neutral and charged
plasma point for various values of Γ ranging from 0 to

2

100 and for various values of an eﬀective electron screen-
ing length. We consider plasmas composed of a single
species of ions; in particular, in the case of a charged
test particle, its charge is assumed to be equal to that
of perturbers. The calculations are performed mainly
by the MC method; for comparison we have done also
APEX calculations. We also present analytic formulas
which reproduce the calculated electric microﬁeld proba-
bility distributions with an accuracy comparable to small
diﬀerences between the MC and APEX results.

In the next section, we describe basic assumptions used
in our calculations and write down some asymptotic re-
sults. In Sec. III, we present results of numerical calcu-
lations and analytic approximations for microﬁeld distri-
butions produced at a neutral or charged point by ions
interacting via unscreened or screened Coulomb poten-
tials. The results are summarized in Sec. IV.

II. METHOD

A. Basic assumptions

We consider a nonrelativistic, isotropic, overall neutral
plasma at the thermodynamic equilibrium. The ions are
assumed to be classical and pointlike. The electric ﬁeld
created at a point r by an ion placed at ri equals ˜E(ri −
r) =
), where V (r) is an eﬀective pair

In the linear approximation, a test charge q embedded
(at r = 0) creates perturbation of electron number den-
sity ˜ne(r) = (∂ne/∂µ)˜µ(r), where ˜µ(r) =
eφ(r) is
the perturbation of the electron chemical potential µ,
and φ(r) is the excess electrostatic potential determined
by the Poisson equation

The solution of Eq. (7) and the right-hand side of Eq. (6)
are given by accurate Pad´e approximations in Ref. [29].
In the limits of weak or strong electron degeneracy, ks
tends to the inverse Debye length for the electrons or to
the Thomas-Fermi wave number, respectively.

We adopt the conventional assumption that the poten-

B. Monte Carlo technique

In the numerical MC calculations, the coordinates of
(N + 1) particles (one test particle and N perturbers)
are chosen in a cubic box of side length L such that
(N + 1)/L3 = ni. In order to include the eﬀect of distant
particles, the box is replicated by its “images” ﬁlling the
space with the step L. The sum of the interaction po-
tentials with all ion images is calculated using the Ewald
technique [30] and, in order to ensure isotropy, the aver-
aging over the complete solid angle is applied. As shown
in Ref. [21], a result of this procedure is equivalent to
the replacement of the potential (5) in the cube by an
eﬀective potential VL,

where C′M is a numerical constant which tends to the

The total potential energy W is obtained by the summa-
tion of VL over all pairs of particles.

(cid:20)

During the MC run, an ion within the box and its
displacement are chosen randomly. If the displacement
brings the ion outside the box, the ion is replaced by
its image. In strongly correlated plasmas, the displace-
ment is limited by a maximum distance smaller than L,
in order to avoid calculation of the energy for highly im-
probable conﬁgurations. First 104 ion conﬁgurations are
discarded in order to erase traces of the starting con-
ﬁguration. The state of equilibrium is searched by the

3

Metropolis algorithm: the energy diﬀerence ∆W is cal-
culated between the consecutive conﬁgurations, and the
new conﬁguration is accepted deﬁnitely if this diﬀerence
∆W/kBT if
is negative and accepted with probability e−
∆W is positive. The latter condition allows the sys-
tem to escape from trapping in a local energy minimum.
When the system approaches equilibrium, W ceases to
change appreciably. Then all equilibrium quantities de-
pending only on particle positions (electric microﬁeld,
pair correlation function, etc.) can be calculated. In all
our simulations, we try to get the maximum precision
by minimizing the statistical errors. So we considered
large boxes of particles (between N = 600 and N = 800)
107 conﬁgurations were
and, for each state (Γ, s), (1–6)
generated after equilibrium. This number of samples is
large enough for the precision needed for all microﬁeld
distribution results discussed in this paper.

C. Asymptotic and approximate expressions

The described MC sampling procedure does not di-
rectly provide the probability density for extremely weak
or strong ﬁelds, which are given by rare conﬁgurations. It
is therefore useful to know asymptotic behavior of P (β)
in the limits β

.
→ ∞
In the ﬁrst case, the methods of Baranger and Mozer
[11] and APEX [8, 16] show a parabolic dependence of
P (β) near the origin. This behavior is also visible on MC
results. Thus we assume that P (β)/β2 is constant near
the origin.

Coeﬃcients of the asymptotic expression have been ﬁtted on

shown by the two other methods (MC: numerical statistical

shown in Refs. [24, 34], for any simulation of practical
interest, it is always possible to ﬁnd appropriate ˜Γ and
˜K to ﬁt the high-ﬁeld tail of the microﬁeld distribution.

First we consider the distribution of electric microﬁelds
applied to a neutral test particle embedded in a plasma.
If the plasma is weakly coupled, P (β) is given by the
Holtsmark formula (11). In theoretical models (e.g., [5,
6]) one is often interested in the cumulative probability
distribution deﬁned as

With increasing Γ, the ﬁeld distribution becomes nar-

corresponds to the maximum of P (β), can be described
by a simple approximate formula

The asymptotic behavior of P (β) remains power-law, as
in the case without Coulomb coupling. This facilitates
construction of self-consistent rational approximations to
Q(β) and P (β). We have calculated P (β) for various Γ
from 0 to 10 by the APEX method and for Γ up to 100
by the MC technique. Our ﬁt to Q(β) reads

in Fig. 3.

For the charged test particle, the asymptotic behavior
of P (β) at large β is qualitatively diﬀerent in the cases
of zero and non-zero Γ. When Γ
= 0, the power-law
decrease of P (β) is replaced by an exponential. At mod-
erate β and large Γ, P (β) is approximately described by
the Mayer distribution (13). The cumulative function of
this distribution is

The microﬁeld probability density at various values of
Γ is shown in Fig. 4. The exponential decrease of P (β)
at large Γ is more easily seen in the logarithmic scale
(Fig. 5). According to Eq. (14), the exponent at large
β is proportional to √β, and not to β2 as in Eqs. (13)
and (18). Nevertheless, it is still possible to construct a
self-consistent analytic approximation to Q(β) and P (β)
analogous to Eq. (17). Since the asymptotes are qualita-
tively diﬀerent in diﬀerent coupling regimes, this approx-
imation is more complicated:

B. Eﬀective screened potential

In this section, we consider microﬁeld distribution in
an electron-screened Coulomb plasma. Assuming that
the ions interact via the eﬀective potential (5), we have
performed MC simulations of P (β) for various values of
the screening parameter from s = 0.05 to s = 3.0 and the
Coulomb coupling parameter from Γ = 0.1 to Γ = 100.
In accord with an intuitive expectation, the MC simula-
tions show that the typical ﬁelds applied to a test par-
ticle are reduced when the electron screening is taken
into account. In this case, the probability density P and
its cumulative function Q depend on three dimensionless
arguments: β, Γ, and s. Naturally, analytic approxi-
mations in this three-dimensional space become complex
and less accurate than at ﬁxed s = 0; nevertheless we
have attempted to construct uniﬁed formulas for evalua-
tion of P (β) with an accuracy which is suﬃcient for most

monotonically decreasing function of s. The dependence
of βm on Γ is less obvious. At small values of s, βm

opposite is observed when s is large:
in this case, βm
increases with growing Γ. This implies that the most
probable ﬁeld strength depends on s stronger at small Γ
and weaker at large Γ.

The modiﬁcation of the probability density proﬁle with
variation of the plasma parameters Γ and s is shown in
Figs. 7–10. In the most important range of the coupling
parameter, Γ . 10, the dependence of P (β) on Γ becomes
slow, as the screening becomes suﬃciently strong. For
example, in Fig. 7 we observe a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of
P (β) at s = 0.05, when Γ increases from 0.1 to 5, whereas
P (β) is only slightly modiﬁed with the same increase of
Γ, if s = 1.5.

On the other hand, the proﬁle of P (β) strongly de-
pends on the value of the screening parameter s (Fig. 8),
especially if s & 1. In this case, the most probable ﬁeld
is reduced drastically; simultaneously, the distribution
acquires a long “tail,” which shows that the values of
β
βm occur more often than in the s = 0 case. Fig-
ure 9, which presents the same dependences on the loga-
rithmic scale, clearly reveals the two limiting power laws,
5/2 at small and large β values, respec-
P
tively, in agreement with Sec. II C. We see that these
limits are approached considerably more slowly in the
case of strong screening.

Consider now the microﬁeld distribution created by
plasma ions at a point where one of these ions is placed,
assuming that the Coulomb interaction is screened ac-
cording to Eq. (5). As well as in the case of a neutral
point, the screening lowers typical microﬁeld values. De-
pendence of the most probable ﬁeld βm on s and Γ can
be approximated by a simple expression

the case of a neutral point considered in the preceding
section, βch

The modiﬁcation of the probability density P (β) with

dence on the coupling parameter Γ remains qualitatively
the same as without screening: with the increase of Γ,
the typical ﬁeld strengths become lower, and the distri-
bution P (β) becomes narrower. The increase of s also

too cumbersome. Therefore we have chosen to construct
an analytic approximation to the function P only. When-
ever necessary, Q can be found by numerical integration
[Eq. (15)].

Our approximate formula is presented in Appendix C.
Its quality is revealed by Figs. 11–14, where the ﬁt is
compared with results of the MC simulations. The typi-
cal accuracy of several percent at s . 1.5 is expected to
be suﬃcient for most applications. At s > 1.5 the accu-
racy deteriorates, and at s > 2 the asymptotic behavior
at large β is not reproduced, as one can see from the log-
arithmic plots (Fig. 13). At such strong screening, the
ﬁt still may be used for evaluation of P (β) not too far

from βm. Indeed, on the linear scale (Figs. 12, 14) the
diﬀerence between the ﬁt and the MC results appears to
be small even at s = 3.

Figure 14 allows one to compare the screening eﬀects
in the two cases of a neutral and charged test particle.
Since Γ is greater than unity, the diﬀerence between P (β)
functions in the two cases is large at s = 0.05 (i.e., for a
nearly Coulomb potential), in agreement with Sec. III A.
With the increase of s, however, the diﬀerence becomes
smaller near the peak of P (β). The positions of the peaks
for a neutral and charged points almost coincide at s >
1, and the diﬀerence in their heights is caused by the
fact that, in the case of a neutral point, P (β) decreases
much more slowly at large β, and therefore the region of
β
βm gives a larger contribution to the normalization
integral, than it does in the case of a charged point.

IV. SUMMARY

interacting via Coulomb potential,

We have calculated microﬁeld distributions at neutral
and charged test particles in a one-component plasma
of ions,
in various
regimes from weak to strong coupling. The MC and
APEX methods of calculation yield similar distributions,
in agreement with previously known results [16]. Self-
consistent elementary-function approximations for the
ﬁeld probability density P (β) and its cumulative distri-
bution Q(β) are constructed in the two cases of a neutral

10

dimensionless screening parameter s [Eq. (8)] varies from
0 to 3. The whole set of numerical results for P (β) at
various values of the coupling and screening parameters
is approximated by analytic expressions.

The obtained results can be used in theoretical mod-
els of optical spectra and equations of state of Coulomb
plasmas.

APPENDIX A: HIGH-FIELD ASYMPTOTIC
EXPRESSION FOR THE MICROFIELD
DISTRIBUTION

In this Appendix, we outline the derivation of the
strong-ﬁeld asymptotic limit of Eq. (9). For brevity, we
adopt the convention that all lengths and radius vectors
are measured in units of the ion-sphere radius a.

We take advantage of the fact that, for Coulomb inter-
actions, high-ﬁeld contributions are produced by nearest
particles. This well-known result has been investigated
in Ref. [13]. We assume (i) that the microﬁeld at r0 = 0
is dominated by the contribution of the nearest neighbor
ion located at r1, and (ii) that only the potential of this
ion contributes to the potential energy. Then Eq. (9) can
be approximated by

point at Γ = 1.5 and for four values of s. Dotted lines show

and charged point, for a Coulomb coupling parameter Γ
varying from 0 to 102.

Furthermore, MC calculations of the microﬁeld distri-
bution have been performed for the screened Coulomb
interaction, using the model of ions interacting via the
Debye-like (Yukawa) eﬀective potential, with an eﬀective
screening length as a second independent parameter. The

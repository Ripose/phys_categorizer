Solar wind turbulence is dominated by Alfv´enic ﬂuctuations but the power spectral exponents
somewhat surprisingly evolve toward the Kolmogorov value of −5/3, that of hydrodynamic turbu-
lence. We show that at 1AU the turbulence decomposes linearly into two coexistent components
perpendicular and parallel to the local average magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁrst of these is consistent with
propagating Alfv´en wavepackets and shows the scaling expected of Alfv´enic turbulence, namely
Irosnikov- Kraichnan. The second shows Kolmogorov scaling which we also ﬁnd in the number and
magnetic energy density, and Poynting ﬂux.

The solar wind provides a unique laboratory for
the study of Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence
with a magnetic Reynolds number estimated to exceed
105 in the solar wind[1].
In-situ satellite observations
of bulk plasma parameters strongly suggest the pres-
ence of turbulence via the statistical properties of their
ﬂuctuations[2, 3]. Quantifying these ﬂuctuations is also
central to understanding both the transport of solar en-
ergetic particles and galactic cosmic rays within the he-
liosphere, and solar wind evolution with implications for
the mechanisms that accelerate the wind at the corona.

The observed ﬂuctuations in the solar wind present a
complex mixture of hydrodynamic and Alfv´enic signa-
tures. Alfv´enic ﬂuctuations dominate the power in these
ﬂuctuations and are observed propagating away from the
sun implying solar origin (e.g.
[4]). However the power
spectra [2, 3, 4, 5] suggest an exponent evolving toward
the Kolmogorov[6] (hereafter K-41) value of ∼ 5/3, that
of hydrodynamic turbulence. This is paradoxical since
for ideal MHD the turbulent cascade is expected to be
mediated via Alfv´en wavepackets suggesting an exponent
of ∼ −2/3, that of Irosnikov and Kraichnan[7] (here-
after IK). Intervals can be found where diﬀerent magnetic
ﬁeld and velocity components simultaneously exhibit K-
41 and IK scaling[8, 9], indeed, these phenomenologies
can be diﬃcult to distinguish in low order moments[10].
The ﬂow is also observed to be intermittent, this has
been suggested to account for the ’anomalous’ −5/3 scal-
ing in the power spectra in terms of incompressible MHD,
rather than hydrodynamic, phenomenology[11]. Alfv´enic
ﬂuctuations, when isolated by the use of Elsasser vari-
ables (see e.g.[4]), and decomposed by considering dif-
ferent average magnetic ﬁeld orientations that occur at
diﬀerent times, are found to be multicomponent[12], and
coupled[13]. This picture, of an essentially incompress-
ible, multicomponent Alfv´enic turbulence[4, 12] suggests
that a signiﬁcant population of Alfv´enic ﬂuctuations
evolve to have wavevectors almost perpendicular to the

background magnetic ﬁeld, leading to a ’ﬂuid- like’ (in the
sense of K-41) phenomenology, and the −5/3 power spec-
tral slope. However, ﬂuctuations in solar wind density
are not simply proportional to that in magnetic ﬁeld[14]
and show nontrivial scaling[2, 15] that suggests that the
turbulence is compressible[16]. The role of compressibil-
ity is thus an open question. An important corollary is
that the full behaviour cannot be captured by models
which describe the observed Alfv´enic properties in terms
of ﬂuctuating coronal ﬁelds that have advected passively
in the expanding solar wind[17].

Here, we will quantify the interplay between K-41 and
IK phenomenologies in the turbulent solar wind. We
can discuss the statistical properties of ﬂuctuations in
some variable of the ﬂow, such as velocity, magnetic
ﬁeld, or density, by considering ensemble averages. Fluc-
tuations in the velocity ﬁeld can be characterized by
the diﬀerence in some component, or in the magnitude,
δv = v(r+L)−v(r) at two points separated by distance L.
The dependence of δv upon L is determined in a statis-
tical sense through the moments < δvp >, where < ... >
denotes an ensemble average over r. Statistical theories
of turbulence then anticipate scaling < δvp

L >∼ Lζ(p).

L >∼ ǫp

Kolmogorov’s 1941 theory for hydrodynamic ﬂows[6]
essentially follows from dimensional analysis. A ﬂuctu-
ation δv arising from a transient structure in the ﬂow
with characteristic lengthscale L, and timescale T , trans-
fers kinetic energy δv2 implying an energy transfer rate
ǫL ∼ δv2/T ∼ δv3/L.
If the statistics of the ﬂuctua-
tions in the energy transfer rate are independent of L,
its p moments < ǫp
0 where the constant ǫ0 is
the average rate of energy transfer. This gives the K-
41 scaling < δvp
L >∼ Lp/3. In practice, hydrodynamic
ﬂows are found to deviate from this simple scaling. This
intermittency[18] is introduced through a lengthscale de-
pendence of the ﬂuctuations in energy transfer rate so
that < ǫp
0(L/L0)µ(p), where L0 is some character-
istic lengthscale and µ(p) is the intermittency correction.
The scaling for the moments then becomes < δvp
L >∼
Lζ(p) with the K-41 exponents ζ(p) = p/3 − µ(p/3). For
incompressible MHD turbulence, Alfv´enic phenomenol-
ogy mediates the cascade, introducing an additional char-

acteristic speed, the Alfv´en speed vA. The above dimen-
sional argument then gives an energy transfer rate ǫL ∼
(δv2/T )(δv/vA) ∼ δv4/L, which is just that proposed by
Iroshnikov and Kraichnan[7], so that < δvp >∼ Lζ(p)
now with ζ(p) = p/4 − µ(p/4).

The experimental study of turbulence then centres
around measurement of the scaling exponents, the ζ(p).
A full description requires the (diﬃcult to determine)
intermittency correction, the µ(p). However, if the sys-
tem is in a homogeneous steady state, the average en-
ergy transfer rate is uniform so that < ǫL >= ǫ0 and
µ(1) = 0 giving, for K-41 ζ(3) = 1, and for IK, ζ(4) = 1,
independent of the intermittency of the ﬂow. A deter-
mination of the lower order moments that is suﬃciently
accurate to distinguish these two cases is possible for in-
situ observations of the solar wind and we present this
here. These observations are typically time series from a
single spacecraft so that the ensemble averages that we
will consider will be over time rather than over space,
the spatial separation L above being replaced by a time
interval τ - the Taylor hypothesis[1]. Consistent with al-
most all experimental studies of turbulence we consider
generalized structure functions of a given parameter x:
Sp(τ ) = h| x(t + τ ) − x(t) |pi. Solar wind monitors such
as the ACE spacecraft spend several-year long periods
in orbit about the Lagrange point sunward of the earth.
We analyse 64s averaged plasma parameters from ACE
for the interval 01/01/1998 - 12/31/2001, this consists of
∼ 1.6 × 106 samples and is dominated by slow solar wind.
Figure 1 shows the procedure for extracting the scaling
exponents from the data. The inset panel shows the
structure functions of ﬂuctuations in the density versus
diﬀerencing interval for p = 1−4. There is a scaling range
for timescales of minutes up to a few hours, the timescale

for large scale coherent structures. This scaling range has
been shown to extend up to almost three orders of magni-
tude via Extended Self Similarity (ESS)[16]. The scaling
exponents, that is, the ζ(p), where Sp(τ ) ∼ τ ζ(p), are the
gradients of these scaling regions, and these are shown
in the main plot. The error bars provide an estimate of
the uncertainty in the gradients of the ﬁtted lines (lin-
ear regression error). Finite, experimental data sets in-
clude a small number of extreme events which have poor
representation statistically and may obscure the scaling
properties of the time series. One method[8, 19] for ex-
cluding these rare events is to ﬁx a (large) upper limit
on the magnitude of ﬂuctuations used in computing the
structure functions. Importantly, this limit is varied with
the temporal scale τ to account for the growth of range
with τ in the time series. The ﬁgure shows the expo-
nents computed for a range of values for this upper limit
[5, 20]σ(τ ), where σ(τ ) = S1/2
. We see that the scaling
2
exponents are insensitive to the value of the upper limit
once a limit is applied and the rare large events are re-
moved. Above 10σ(τ ) this process eliminates less than
1% of the data points.

We now compare the scaling exponents for diﬀerent
scalar quantities in the solar wind ﬂow, for structure
functions up to p = 4. In Figure 2 we show the scaling
exponents for ﬂuctuations in the magnitude of velocity v
and magnetic ﬁeld B (blue symbols), along with those for
the number density ρ, the magnetic energy density B2,
the ﬂux density ρv2 and the Poynting ﬂux in the MHD
limit vB2 (black symbols). The scaling exponents for
these low order structure functions are determined with
suﬃcient precision that we can see that in the case of
the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld magnitudes, the ζ(4) ex-

ponents are clustered about unity, whereas for the other
quantities, the ζ(3) exponents are clustered about unity.
Thus the ﬂuctuations in velocity and magnetic ﬁeld mag-
nitude appear to be dominated by Alfv´enic processes, in
the sense of IK phenomenology, whereas the ﬂuctuations
in the magnetic ﬁeld energy, plasma and ﬂux densities
are hydrodynamic- like, in the sense of K-41.
Intrigu-
ingly, these two phenomenologies are coexistent.

We now introduce an operation that ’ﬁlters out’ one
of the relevant physical processes, namely, Alfv´enic ﬂuc-
tuations. We exploit the property that the full non- lin-
ear MHD equations support large scale Alfv´enic ﬂuctua-

tions which share a basic property of Alfv´en waves- that
the velocity perturbation is perpendicular to the back-
ground magnetic ﬁeld. In the turbulent ﬂow, the mag-
netic ﬁeld also ﬂuctuates, but we can consider a local
background value by constructing a running average of
the vector magnetic ﬁeld over the timescale τ ′. For each
interval over which we obtain a diﬀerence in velocity
δv = v(t + τ ) − v(t) we also obtain a vector average
for the magnetic ﬁeld direction ˆb = ¯B/ | ¯B | from a vec-
tor sum of all the observed vector values between t and
t + τ ′, ¯B(t, τ ′) = B(t) + ... + B(t + τ ′), with τ ′ centred on
τ . We choose the interval τ ′ = 2τ here as the minimum
(Nyquist) necessary to capture wavelike ﬂuctuations. Ve-
locity diﬀerences δv which are Alfv´enic in character will
then have the property that the scalar product δv · ˆb will
vanish. This condition ﬁlters out all those ﬂuctuations
which generate a velocity displacement perpendicular to
the local magnetic ﬁeld, and is thus less restrictive than
the Elsasser[4] variables which select propagating pure
Alfv´en waves. In Figure 3 we plot the structure functions
of the quantity δvk = δv·ˆb, that is, Sp =<| δv· ˆb |p> ver-
sus τ , (inset) and the corresponding scaling exponents,
the ζ(p) for the region where Sp ∼ τ ζ(p) (main plot) gen-
erated in the same way as in Figure 1. In Figure 4 we
compare these exponents with those obtained for the re-
maining signal, that is, δv⊥ = p(δv · δv − (δv · ˆb)2).
Remarkably, both these quantities show a clear scaling
range (which we will verify) with scaling exponents ζ(3)
and ζ(4) close to unity for δvk and δv⊥ respectively.

This result is consistent with the ﬂuctuations in veloc-
ity being a simple linear superposition that are close to
(i) parallel to the local background magnetic ﬁeld and
sharing hydrodynamic- like scaling, that is K-41, with
that of the number, magnetic energy and ﬂux densities,
and (ii) perpendicular to the local background magnetic
ﬁeld with the scaling expected of Alfv´enic turbulence in
the sense of IK. These results provide the ﬁrst unam-

We verify that these quantities indeed show an ex-
tended scaling region by means of ESS[20]. If the scaling
is such that the Sp ∼ Sζ(p)/ζ(q)
then a plot of Sp versus
Sq will reveal the range of the underlying power law de-
pendence with τ . If, as here, one of the ζ(p) are close
to unity, the ESS plot will in addition provide a better
estimate of the ζ(p). Figures 5 and 6 show Sp versus
S3 for δvk and versus S4 for δv⊥ respectively, and we
see that there is scaling over several orders of magnitude.

The slopes of these plots imply exponents that are mul-
tifractal, that is, quadratic in p, and distinct for the two
cases.

The characteristic nature of solar wind turbulence is re-
vealed to be a coexistence of two signatures. The ﬁrst of
these is consistent with Alfv´enic turbulence in the sense
of IK mediated by Alfv´en wavepackets propagating par-
allel to the magnetic ﬁeld. The second, which shows K-41
scaling, has a compressive component and could couple
nonlinearly into strongly oblique, almost non propagat-
ing Alfv´enic ﬂuctuations. This clearly elucidates the pre-
viously proposed multicomponent nature of solar wind
turbulence and suggests one of two scenarios. The ﬁrst
of these is that the turbulent solar wind is comprised of
two weakly interacting components- one from the pro-
cess that generates the solar wind at the corona and the
other that evolves in the high Reynolds number ﬂow.
Given the evidence for outward propagating Alfv´en waves
and evolution toward K-41 scaling, these correspond to
IK, and K-41 phenomenology respectively and our re-
sult yields an important insight into the physics of solar
wind generation. Alternatively, the coexistence of the
two components is characteristic of the anisotropic na-
ture of compressible MHD turbulence in the presence of
a background ﬁeld, in which case this determination of
their scaling properties points to an important modiﬁca-
tion of theories of MHD turbulence.

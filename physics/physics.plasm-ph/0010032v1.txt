Abstract

Conﬁnement phenomenology characteristic of magnetically conﬁned plas-

mas emerges naturally from a simple sandpile algorithm when the parameter

controlling redistribution scalelength is varied. Close analogues are found for

enhanced conﬁnement, edge pedestals, and edge localised modes (ELMs), and

for the qualitative correlations between them. These results suggest that toka-

mak observations of avalanching transport are deeply linked to the existence

The introduction of the sandpile paradigm [1]- [3] into magnetized plasma physics (fusion

[4]- [10], magnetospheric [11]- [13], and accretion disk [14]- [16]: for recent reviews see Ref.

[17,18]) has opened new conceptual avenues. It provides a framework within which observa-

tions of rapid nondiﬀusive nonlocal transport phenomena can be studied; recent examples

include analyses of auroral energy deposition derived from global imaging [13], and of elec-

tron temperature ﬂuctuations in the DIII-D tokamak [10], both of which involve avalanching.

Insofar as such phenomena resemble those in experimental sandpiles or mathematically ide-

alized models thereof, they suggest that the conﬁnement physics of macroscopic systems

(plasma and other) may reﬂect unifying underlying principles.

In this paper we present results suggesting that this unity may extend to some of the most

distinctive features of toroidal magnetic plasma conﬁnement: enhanced conﬁnement regimes

(“H-modes”), edge localised modes (“ELMs”), steep edge gradients (“edge pedestal”), and

their observed phenomenological and statistical correlations – for recent quantitative studies,

see for example Refs. [19–21] and references therein. An important question is whether the

L to H transition necessarily reﬂects a catastrophic bifurcation of conﬁnement properties,

or can be associated with a monotonic change in the character of the turbulence [21]. We

show that key elements of the observed phenomenology emerge naturally from a simple

one-dimensional sandpile model, that of Chapman [22] (hereafter CDH), which incorporates

other established models [1,23] as limiting cases. The centrally fueled (at cell n = 1) CDH

model’s distinctive algorithmic feature relates to the local redistribution of sand at a cell

(say at n = k) where the critical gradient zc is exceeded: the sandpile is ﬂattened behind

the unstable cell over a “ﬂuidization length” Lf , embracing the cells n = k − (Lf − 1), k −

(Lf − 2), ..., k; and this sand is conservatively relocated to the cell at n = k + 1. In Ref. [22]

the CDH sandpile is explored for all regimes 1 < Lf < N for both constant and ﬂuctuating

critical gradient zc. Here we consider the dynamics of the more realistic case with random

ﬂuctuations in zc; the system is robust in that once ﬂuctuations are introduced in the critical

gradient, the behavior is essentially insensitive to both their level and spectral properties

[22], see also Ref. [17]. The limit Lf = 1 is the ﬁxed point corresponding to the centrally

3

fueled algorithm of Ref. [1] in one dimension. In the limit Lf = N (where N is the number of

cells in the sandpile) the sandpile is ﬂattened everywhere behind an unstable cell as in Refs.

[23,17]. A real space renormalization group approach [24] shows that the robust scale free

dynamics for the limiting case Lf = N corresponds to a nontrivial (repulsive) ﬁxed point

(see e.g. Ref. [3]). The essential result of Ref. [22] is that diﬀerent regimes of avalanche

statistics emerge, resembling a transition from regular to intermittent dynamics reminiscent

of deterministic chaos. The control parameter is the normalized redistribution scalelength

Lf /N which speciﬁes whether the system is close to the nontrivial Lf = N ﬁxed point.

Height proﬁles for a CDH sandpile with 512 cells, time averaged over many thousands of

avalanches, are shown in Fig.1 for three diﬀerent values of the ﬂuidization length Lf in the

range 50 < Lf < 250. The sandpile proﬁle shape, stored gravitational potential energy, and

edge structure (smooth decline or pedestal) correlate with each other and with Lf . As Lf

is reduced, the edge pedestal steepens and the time averaged stored energy rises; multiple

“barriers” (regions of steep gradient) are visible in trace (a) and to some extent trace (b)

of Fig.1. Time evolution of the CDH sandpile for Lf = 50, 150, and 250 respectively is

quantiﬁed in Figs.2-4. The top traces show total stored energy; the middle traces show the

position of the edge of the sandpile (the last occupied cell); and the bottom traces show

the magnitude and occurrence times of mass loss events (hereafter MLEs) in which sand

is lost from the system by being transferred beyond the 512th cell. Time is normalized to

the mean inter-avalanche time ∆τ (proportional to the fueling rate). The CDH sandpile

is fueled only at the ﬁrst cell, so that the great majority of avalanches terminate before

reaching the 512th cell (these are classiﬁed as internal). While internal avalanches result in

energy dissipation (recorded in the upper traces of Figs.2-4), and may alter the position of

the edge of the sandpile, they do not result in an MLE; there are corresponding periods of

quiescence in the middle and lower traces of Figs.2-4. Conversely the MLEs are associated

with sudden inward movement of the sandpile edge, and in this important sense appear to

be edge localised. However, MLEs and the associated inward edge movement are in fact the

result of systemwide avalanches triggered at the sandpile center (cell n = 1). The character

4

of the MLEs changes with Lf . In Fig.2, where the mean and peak stored energy are greatest,

the MLEs are similar to each other and occur with some regularity. The regularity of MLE

occurrence in Fig.3 is less marked, the magnitude of the largest MLEs is greater than in

Fig.2, and there is greater spread in MLE size. This trend continues in Fig.4, which also has

the lowest stored energy. These eﬀects correlate with the underlying dynamics of the CDH

sandpile. Figure 5 plots the relation between average stored energy and Lf for the N = 512

system and much larger N = 4096 and 8192 systems (normalized to the system size N).

The curves coincide, demonstrating invariance with respect to system size, with an inverse

power law with slope close to −2 for Lf /N < 1/4, and a break at Lf /N ∼ 1/4. These

two regimes yield the quasi-regular and quasi-intermittent dynamics in Figs.2-4 (see also

the plot of avalanche length distribution against Lf in Fig.8 of Ref. [22]). The parameter

Lf /N is a measure of proximity of this high dimensional system to the Lf = N nontrivial

ﬁxed point. This determines both the apparent complexity of the timeseries in Figs.2-4 and

the underlying statistical simplicity described below, which is also invariant with respect to

system size.

There is systematic correlation between time averaged stored energy < E > and MLE

frequency fM LE, as shown in Fig.6. To obtain these curves, which are again normalized to

system size, we have derived MLE frequencies using a standard algorithm previously used

[20] to assign frequencies to ELMs observed in tokamak plasmas in the Joint European Torus

(JET). Since the CDH sandpile often generates bursts of mass loss with structure down to the

smallest timescales, which might not be resolvable under experimental conditions, we have

followed Ref. [20] in applying a (relatively narrow) measurement window of width 450∆τ to

obtain fM LE. The correlation between < E > and fM LE is a noteworthy emergent property,

furthermore Fig.6’s characteristic curve is very similar to that of Fig.6 of Ref. [19], which

relates measured energy conﬁnement to ELM frequency in JET. Energy conﬁnement time

τc can be deﬁned for the CDH sandpile by dividing the time averaged stored energy < E >

by the time averaged energy dissipation rate < ∆E > (where ∆E is the energy dissipated

in a single avalanche). The embedded plot of Fig. 6 shows τc against MLE frequency fM LE.

5

Finally, we explore the situation where there is a secular change in the redistribution

algorithm:

in Fig.7, Lf decreases slowly, continuously, and linearly with time, from one

constant value to another over a period encompassing many tens of thousands of avalanches.

There is a corresponding time evolution of the energy conﬁnement properties of the sandpile

and of the character of the MLEs. Figure 7(top) shows total stored energy as a function of

time as Lf changes from 250 at t = 4 × 104 to 50 at t = 1.15 × 105, while ∼ 105 avalanches

occur: over a period of time corresponding to a few tens of MLEs, the system smoothly

evolves from low to high conﬁnement. This is accompanied by a gradual change in character

of the time variation in the sandpile edge (position of last occupied cell, Fig.7(middle)) and of

the MLEs (Fig.7(lower)), from large amplitude to small and from irregular to regular. Figure

7 can perhaps be regarded as the CDH sandpile analogue of, for example, Fig.2 of Ref. [20] or

Fig.2 of [21]. The essential point here is that the sandpile apparently freely explores phase

space with changing control parameter Lf /N. Characteristic properties of the dynamics

(whether quasi-regular or quasi-intermittent) and correspondingly, conﬁnement properties

(such as stored energy and MLE characteristics) smoothly follow changes in this parameter

rather than exhibiting a sudden phase transition or catastrophe.

By varying a single control parameter in the CDH sandpile algorithm, we have shown

correlations between: stored energy, conﬁnement times, sandpile proﬁle, sandpile edge struc-

ture, and the amplitude, frequency, and dynamical character of mass loss events. We have

also seen how slow secular change in the control parameter produces a smooth evolution in

conﬁnement properties. If a single control parameter analogous to Lf /N exists for tokamaks,

it can in principle be found from experimental data by examining scaling with respect to

system size as above.

The existence of such extensive tokamak-like phenomenology, emergent from a very sim-

ple system, is a novel discovery. Insofar as the phenomenological resemblance is close, there

is more to be learnt. A minimalist interpretation starts from the premise that the CDH

sandpile algorithm provides a simple one-parameter model for studying generic nonlocal

transport, conditioned by a critical gradient, in a macroscopic conﬁnement system. Chang-

6

ing the value of the single control parameter Lf then corresponds to altering the range in

conﬁguration space over which the transport process operates.

It then follows from the

results in the present paper that this may be the minimum requirement to generate those

aspects of tokamak-like conﬁnement phenomenology described. This is a signiﬁcant conclu-

sion, but one can consider a more far-reaching one. A possible maximalist interpretation

attaches greater weight to recent observations [6,9,10] of avalanching transport in tokamaks

and in largescale numerical simulations [7,8] thereof, and therefore regards the avalanch-

ing transport that is built into sandpile algorithms as an additional point of contact with

magnetically conﬁned plasmas. One would then infer from the present results that toka-

mak observations of avalanching transport are deeply linked to the existence of enhanced

conﬁnement and ELMs.

Abstract

In this paper, two classes of exact analytic time-dependent soultion of magnetic annihi-

lation for incompressible magnetic ﬂuid, have been obtained by solving the magnetohydro-

dynamic (MHD) equations directly. The solutions derived here possess scaling property with

time t as the scale factor. Based on these two solutions, we ﬁnd that, for some given inﬂow

ﬁelds, the evolution of the annihilating magnetic ﬁeld can be described by the solutions of

certain ordinary diﬀerential equations whose variables are dilated simply by time t. The

relevant evolution characteristics in the process of magnetic annihilation are also revealed.

As is well known, magnetic reconnection is a very important physical phenomena in

many astrophysical objects. It is believed that, magnetic reconnection can serve as such a

mechanism to transfer the magnetic energy into heat and kinetic energy of the plasma [1, 2].

Generally, due to the nonlinearity of the MHD equations, it is very diﬃcult to ﬁnd

its analytic solutions. We have to turn to the numerical simulations. But, unfortunately,

numerical simulations are usually limited by artiﬁcial resistivity and the implementation of

sensible boundary conditions [3, 4].

Anyway, the exact analytic solutions are needed and helpful. On one hand, they can

provide the important insights into the problem concerned, and on the other hand, they can

be used to test the relevant numerical methods. Just based on the beautiful exact solutions,

Parker found that, diﬀusion is an essential part of the reconnection of lines of force at a neutral

point [5]. Since then, a lot of excellent analytic solutions have been found and applied to

analyze some concrete models [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Recently, Watson, Craig and Henton etc. have made a great progress in searching for the

exact solutions [11, 12, 13, 14]. They found that, exact families of reconnection solutions can

be constructed in both two and three dimensions, and, these solutions display the essential

characteristics of fast reconnection. Furthermore, they have shown that, the reconnection

solutions can be obtained by superposing the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds of simple magnetic

annihilation model.

So, annihilation model can provide a solid basis for our understanding the reconnection

process. Up to now, there are few works on the time-dependent case [10, 15]. Most of the

previous works in searching for the exact solutions concerntrate on the case of the steady

MHD. But, it is desired to remove the restrictions of stationarity and incompressiblety etc.

for the realistic application.

In this paper, we present two time-dependent analytic solutions of the incompressible

MHD. We begin by introducing the basic equations in section 1. The solutions are obtained

in section 2. And, the relevant physics indicated by the solutions is analysized in section 3.

Finally, the conclusions are summarized in section 4.

The incompressible MHD equations can be written as the following nondimensional form

Now, we need to deal with Eqs.(2, 3, 4, 5). Once we solve them and get ~v and ~B, we can
calculate the pressure P according to Eq.(1).

In order to solve Eqs.(2, 3, 4, 5), suppose that ~B, ~v have the following forms

satisﬁed automatically.

Now, Eqs.(4, 5) and Eq.(2) give

If we further suppose that

from Eq.(8), it is evident that

U (x, t) = U (x)g(t)

V (x, t) = V (x)g(t).

Substitute the above two equations into Eqs.(8, 9), we achieve

with ci (i = 1, 2, 3, ...) being the (integral) constants. Now, we are in position to state how
to solve g(t), U (x) and V (x) from the above equations.

Eq.(11) tells us that

Starting out from Eq.(13, 14), we can obtain two solutions.

A. Take U (x) as the linear function of x, then we have

g(t) =

c1t + c3

U (x) = c4x + c5

V (x) =

V (x) = c7ec6x

U (x) = c5c7ec6x + c4

c6c4 = c1

c5c6 =

−
c2 = 0.

In the next step, inserting these solutions into Eq.(10), we can ﬁnally solve the magnetic

ﬁeld.

To give a feeling on the form of the magnetic ﬁeld ~B, let us consider the asymptotic

solution of Y (x, t). When η

0, Eq.(10) is simpliﬁed as

Y (x, t) +

(U (x, t)Y (x, t)) = 0.

corresponding to A and B. Here, the singularity exists evidently at the neutral interface x = 0

for both A and B. The presence of the singularity is naturally unavoidable when diﬀusion

vanishes, as discussed by Parker [5].

Eq.(10) tells us taht, Y (x, t) can not be simply decomposed as the form of X(x)T (t),
after the similar supposition for U (x, t) is made. To solve the magnetic ﬁeld ~B analytically,
a certain transformation is needed.
For solution A, U (x, t) = c4x+c5

Now, the partial diﬀerential equation Eq.(10) has been transformed into the ordinary

diﬀerential equations, whose solutions can be expressed as special functions. The solutions

respectively. Here, C1, C2 are the integral constants, 1F1 is the Kummer conﬂuent hyperge-

ometric function while Γ the incomplete gamma function.

Up to now, we have obtained two classes of the exact analytic solutions for both velocity

ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld. We would like to give a short comment here. It is deserved to note

that, Eqs.(31, 33) are actually the scale transformation with time t as the scaling factor. So,

our solutions will perform certain scaling characteristic, i.e., when the velocity ﬁelds are taken

as Eqs.(16, 22, 15), the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld with time decribed by the solution of

Eq.(10), can be described by the solution of the ordinary diﬀerential equation Eqs.(32, 34)
dilated simply by time t according to (c1t + c3)α.

departs from the initial magnetic neutral interface with time. So, the dissipation area will

get gradually wide. Following it, the current becomes smaller and smaller. The biggest rate

of the diﬀuse of the magnetic energy due to the Joule heat takes place at the beginning.
The solution B is interesting, its current is evidently a soliton. Hence, when the wave-packet

of the current is located in the domain that we consider, the dissipation power keeps as a

constant. But, once it passes through the domain, the dissipation power will descend with

time.

4. Conclusions and Discussions

In conclusion, we have obtained two classes of full analytic time-dependent solutions for

magnetic annihilation by directly solving the MHD equations.

The solutions which we get here have such a scaling property that the evolution of the

relevant physical observables are described by the solutions of certain ordinary diﬀerential

equations, with the variables being some functions of x dilated by time t. Besides, in the case

of asymmetric inﬂow, a soliton-like current can be formed. Finally, the solutions are used to

reveal the relevant physical characteristics in the process of the magnetic annihilation.

However, the time-dependent solutions obtained here are the relative simple ones. Based

on the method provided by Watson, Craig and Henton etc.

[11, 12, 13, 14], we expect to

6

construct the time-dependent reconnection solutions. The work along this direction is under

way.

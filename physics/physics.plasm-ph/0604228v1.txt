INTRODUCTION

High harmonic generation (HHG) from relativistically
intense laser pulses interacting with solid targets has been
identiﬁed as a promising way to generate bright ultra
short bursts of X-rays [1, 2, 3]. For the ﬁrst time this
spectacular phenomenon was observed with nanosecond
pulses of long wavelength (10.6 µm) CO2 laser light [4].
Short after the experimental observation in 1981,
Bezzerides et al studied the problem of harmonic light
emission theoretically [5]. Their approach based on non-
relativistic equations of motion and hydrodynamic ap-
proximation for the plasma predicted a cutoﬀ of the har-
monic spectrum at the plasma frequency.

10 years later,

in 1993, a new approach to the in-
teraction of an ultra short, relativistically strong laser
pulse with overdense plasma was proposed by Bulanov
et al [6]. They ”interpreted the harmonic generation as
due to the Doppler eﬀect produced by a reﬂecting charge
sheet, formed in a narrow region at the plasma bound-
ary, oscillating under the action of the laser pulse” [6].
The ”oscillating mirror” model predicts a cutoﬀ harmonic
number of 4γ2
max, where γmax is the maximal γ-factor of
the mirror.

At the beginning of 1996 numerical results of particle-
in-cell simulations of the harmonic generation by fem-
tosecond laser-solid interaction were presented by P. Gib-
bon [7]. He demonstrated numerically that the high har-
monic spectrum goes well beyond the cutoﬀ predicted in
[5] and also presented a numerical ﬁt for the spectrum,
which approximated the intensity of the n-th harmonic
n−5. At about the same time the laser-overdense
as In ∝
plasma interaction was also studied by Lichters et al [8].
The same year the analytical work by von der Linde
and Rzazewski [9] appeared. The authors used the ”os-
cillating mirror” model and approximated the oscillatory
motion of the mirror as a sin-function of time without
analysis of the applicability of this approximation. With

the explicit form of the mirror motion an analytical for-
mula for the harmonic spectrum was obtained.

The ﬁrst try to describe analytically the high harmon-
ics generated at the boundary of overdense plasma by a
short ultra intense laser pulse in a universal way that does
not rely on an explicit formula for the exact plasma mir-
ror motion was made in [1]. This work proposed for the
ﬁrst time the idea of universality of the harmonic spec-
trum. In an attempt to advocate the ”oscillating mirror”
model and the role of the relativistic Doppler eﬀect the
authors of [1] made use of the steepest descent method
n−5/2.
and estimated the harmonic spectrum as In ∝
However they did not discuss the area of applicability of
the steepest descent method for the speciﬁc problem. We
are showing in this article that applying the straightfor-
ward steepest descent method is equivalent to applying
the ”oscillating mirror” model that proves to be insuﬃ-
cient for the treatment of laser-overdense plasma inter-
action. In the present work we revise [1] and clarify the
physical picture of HHG.

For the last couple of years the interest in the process
of high harmonic generation from plasmas has enjoyed a
revival thanks to the increasing interest in attoscience.
The recent impressive progress in the physics of attosec-
ond X-ray pulses [10] triggers the fascinating question
whether a range of even shorter ones is achievable with
the contemporary or just coming experimental technol-
ogy.

L. Plaja et al [12] were the ﬁrst to realize that the sim-
ple concept of the ”oscillating mirror” gives an opportu-
nity to produce extremely short pulses and presented a
numerical proof that the radiation generated by oscillat-
ing plasma surfaces comes in the form of subfemtosecond
pulses. For the ﬁrst time the idea to use the plasma har-
monics for the generation of subattosecond pulses (zep-
tosecond range) was announced in [1].

The present article improves the analytical results of [1]
and studies in detail the ultra relativistic plasma surface

factor of the
plasma surface. This new physical phenomenon leads to

Our analysis signiﬁcantly exploits the relativistic
plasma similarity theory [15], which was developed after
the work [1] had been published. The similarity theory
enables us to rectify our previous results and to present
them in a straightforward and clear way.

In this article we ﬁrst discuss the physical picture of
high harmonic generation. The production of high har-
monics is attributed to the new physical eﬀect of the
relativistic spikes. Then, we develop analytical theory
describing the spectrum of the high harmonics and show
that this spectrum is universal with slow power law decay.
Finally, the theory is conﬁrmed by direct particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulation results.

II. PHYSICAL PICTURE OF HHG AT
OVERDENSE PLASMA BOUNDARY

In this Section we state the problem of high harmonic
generation at the boundary of overdense plasma and
qualitatively describe its main features, which will ﬁnd
their analytical and numerical conﬁrmation in what fol-
lows.

Let us consider a short laser pulse of ultra relativistic
intensity, interacting with the sharp surface of an over-
dense plasma slab (see Fig. 1).

We assume that the incident laser pulse is short, so
that we can neglect the slow ion dynamics and consider
the electron motion only. The electrons are driven by the
laser light pressure, a restoring electrostatic force comes
from the ions. As a consequence, the plasma surface os-
cillates and the electrons gain a normal momentum com-
ponent.

FIG. 2: a) Electron momentum component parallel to the
surface as a function of time b) The velocity of the plasma
surface vs is a smooth function of time, unlike the γ-factor of
the surface c)

Since the plasma is overdense, the incident electromag-
netic wave is not able to penetrate it. This means that
there is an electric current along the plasma surface. For
this reason, the momenta of electrons in the skin layer
have, apart from the components normal to the plasma
surface, also tangential components.

According to the relativistic similarity theory [15],
both the normal and tangential components are of the
order of the dimensionless electromagnetic potential a0.
Consequently, the actual electron momenta make a ﬁnite
angle with the plasma surface for most of the times.

Since we consider a laser pulse of ultra relativistic in-
tensity, the motion of the electrons is ultra relativistic. In
other words, their velocities are approximately c. Though
the motion of the plasma surface is qualitatively diﬀer-
ent: its velocity vs is not ultra relativistic for most of the
times but smoothly approaches c only when the tangen-
tial electron momentum vanishes (see Fig. 2b).

The γ-factor of the surface γs also shows speciﬁc be-
havior.
It has sharp peaks at those times for which
the velocity of the surface approaches c (see Fig. 2c).
Thus, while the velocity function vs is characterized by
its smoothness, the distinctive features of γs are its quasi-
singularities.

When vs reaches its maximum and γs has a sharp peak,
high harmonics of the incident wave are generated and
can be seen in the reﬂected radiation. Physically this

means that the high harmonics are due to the collective
motion of bunches of fast electrons moving towards the
laser pulse [13].

depend on a0 and the plasma electron density Ne sep-
arately. Instead they merge in the single dimensionless
similarity parameter S deﬁned by

These harmonics have two very important properties.
First, their spectrum is universal. The exact motion of
the plasma surface can be very complicated, since it is
aﬀected by the shape of the laser pulse and can diﬀer
for diﬀerent plasmas. Yet the qualitative behavior of vs
and γs is universal, and since it governs the HHG, the
spectrum of the high harmonics does not depend on the
particular surface motion.

where Nc = ω2
0m/4πe2 is the critical electron density for
the incident laser pulse with amplitude a0 and carrier

In other words, when the plasma density Ne and
the laser amplitude a0 change simultaneously, so that
S = Ne/a0Nc = const, the laser-plasma dynamics re-
mains similar. In particular, this basic ultra relativistic
similarity means that for diﬀerent interactions with the
same S = const, the plasma electrons move along similar
trajectories while their momenta p scale as

The S

similarity corresponds to a multiplicative
transformation group of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations,
which appears in the ultra relativistic regime. The sim-
ilarity is valid for arbitrary values of S. Physically the
S-parameter separates relativistically overdense plasmas
(S

1) from underdense ones (S

≫
To apply the key result (4) of the similarity theory to
the plasma surface motion, we rewrite (4) for the electron
momentum components that are perpendicular pn and
tangential pτ to the plasma surface:

This result is signiﬁcant. It shows that when we increase
the dimensionless vector potential a0 of the incident wave
while keeping the plasma overdense, so that S = const,
both pn and pτ grow as a0. In other words the velocities

are about the speed of light almost at all times. Yet the
relativistic γ-factor of the plasma surface γs(t′) and its
velocity βs(t′) behave in a quite diﬀerent way. To realize
this key fact let us consider the electrons at the very
boundary of the plasma. The scalings (5) state that the
momenta of these electrons can be represented as

FIG. 3: The universal high harmonic spectrum contains power
law decay and exponential decay (plotted in log-log scale).

We show below that the high harmonic spectrum con-
tains two qualitatively diﬀerent parts: power law decay
and exponential decay (see Fig. 3). In the power law part
the spectrum decays as

max,
where In is the intensity of the nth harmonic (see Sec-
tion V). Here γmax is the maximal γ-factor of the point,
where the component of the electric ﬁeld tangential to
the surface vanishes (see Section IV).

The second important feature of the high harmonics is
that they are phase locked. This observation is of partic-
ular value, since it allows for the generation of attosecond
and even subattosecond pulses [1].

III. ULTRA RELATIVISTIC SIMILARITY AND
THE PLASMA SURFACE MOTION

The analytical theory presented in this work is based
on the similarity theory developed in [15] for collisionless
ultra relativistic laser-plasma regime and is valid both for
under- and overdense plasmas.

The ultra relativistic similarity theory states that when
the dimensionless laser vector potential a0 = eA0/mc2
is large (a2

One sees from (6) that when a0 gets large, the rela-
tivistic γ-factor of the electrons becomes large too and
their velocities approach the velocity of light. However,
the dynamics of the plasma boundary is signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent. For large a0s the plasma boundary motion does
not enter the ultra relativistic regime and its relativis-
tic γ-factor γs(t′) is generally of the order of unity. Yet
there is one exception:

that Pτ (S, t′

For the velocity of the plasma boundary one ﬁnds anal-
ogously that it smoothly approaches the velocity of light

As we will see later, the γs spikes cause the generation
of high harmonics in the form of ultra short laser pulses.

IV. BOUNDARY CONDITION: ENERGY
CONSERVATION AND THE APPARENT
REFLECTION POINT

In this Section we introduce the boundary condition
describing the laser-overdense plasma interaction appeal-
ing to physical arguments, just as it was previously done
in [1, 12]. Mathematically rigorous analysis of the bound-
ary condition is given in [13]. However, for the purposes
of the present work it is suﬃcient to treat this problem
on a more intuitive basis [1].

4

One might expect that the ”oscillating mirror” model
could describe the laser-plasma interaction in our prob-
lem. Therefore we want to explain in detail why it is not
the case and then present the derivation of the correct
boundary condition.

≫

The ”oscillating mirror” model implies that the tan-
gential components of the vector potential are zero at
the mirror surface. As a consequence, if the ideal mir-
ror moves with γ
1 towards the laser pulse with the
electric ﬁeld El and the duration τ0, the reﬂected elec-
γ2El and the pulse duration
tric ﬁeld will be Ereﬂ ∝
τ0/γ2. The energy of the reﬂected pulse
will be τreﬂ ∝
would be then γ2 times higher than that of the incident
one. However, since the plasma surface is driven by the
same laser pulse, this scaling is energetically prohibited
and consequently the plasma cannot be described as an
”ideal mirror”.

To derive the correct boundary condition, let us con-
sider the tangential vector potential components of a
laser pulse normally incident onto a overdense plasma
slab. These components satisfy the equation

Now one has to estimate the parameters characterizing
the skin layer, i.e. the characteristic time τs of skin layer
evolution (in the co-moving reference frame) and the skin
layer thickness δ. Since the plasma is driven by the light
1/ω0. The estimation of δ
pressure, one expects that τs ∝
is more subtle. From the ultra relativistic similarity the-
ory follows that δ
1 for strongly
overdense plasmas and ∆ is an exponent that has to be
found analytically. In this work we do not discuss the
exact value of ∆, but notice that this quantity does not
depend on neither S, nor a0. On the other hand, the

ǫ = (ξ/c)∂tj(t, x′), and substitute this expression into

This condition has a straightforward relation to energy
conservation. Indeed, if we consider the Poynting vector

we notice that the boundary condition (16) represents
balance between the incoming and reﬂected electromag-
netic energy ﬂux at the boundary X(t).

The boundary condition (16) allows for another inter-
pretation. An external observer sees that the electro-
magnetic radiation gets reﬂected at the point xARP(t),
where the normal component of the Poynting vector
Bτ /4π = 0, implied by Eτ (xARP) = 0.
Sn = cEτ ×
We call the point xARP(t) the apparent reﬂection point
(ARP).

The actual location of the ARP can be easily found
from the electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution in front of the
plasma surface. The incident laser ﬁeld in vacuum runs in
direction, Ei(x, t) = Ei(x + ct), while the
the negative x
reﬂected ﬁeld is translated backwards: Er(x, t) = Er(x
−
ct). The tangential components of these ﬁelds interfere
destructively at the ARP position xARP(t), so that the
implicit equation for the apparent reﬂection point xARP(t)
is:

−

Ei

τ (xARP + ct) + Er

τ (xARP

ct) = 0.

−

We want to emphasize that Eq. (18) contains the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds in vacuum. That is why the reﬂection
point xARP is apparent. The real interaction within the
plasma skin layer can be very complex. Yet, the external
observer, who has information about the radiation in vac-
uum only, sees that Eτ = 0 at xARP. The ARP is located
within the skin layer at the electron ﬂuid surface, which
is much shorter than the laser wavelength for overdense
plasmas, for which the similarity parameter is S
1. In
this sense, the ARP is attached to the oscillating plasma
surface.

The ﬁne structure of the spectrum of Er(t) depends
on the particular surface motion X(t), which is deﬁned
by the complex laser- plasma interaction at the plasma
surface. Previous theoretical works on high order har-
monic generation from plasma surfaces [7, 8, 9, 12] tried
to approximate the function X(t) in order to evaluate
the harmonic spectrum. For the ﬁrst time analytical de-
scription of the high harmonic intensity spectrum and the
concept of universality were presented in [1]. This work
proclaims the idea that the most important features of
the high harmonic spectrum do not depend on the de-
tailed structure of X(t). However, the article [1] treats
the universal spectrum without any relation to similarity
theory for ultra relativistic plasmas and, as a result, re-
lies on the saddle-point method without proper analysis
whether or not the areas contributing to the spectrum
overlap [1, 17]. In our analysis we overcome these short-
comings of [1].

To ﬁnd the spectrum, we notice that the investigation
of Er(Ω) (20) is equivalent to the investigation of the

used in [1] ascribes the spectrum 1/n5/2 to the whole area
below the cutoﬀ. This is because the areas around the
saddle points contributing to the spectrum overlap signif-
icantly and the approximation used in [1] is not accurate
enough in this part of the spectrum. However, the diﬀer-
ence between the powers 8/3 and 5/2 is only 1/6 and it is
hardly distinguishable numerically and experimentally.

VI. ULTRA SHORT PULSE DURATION

For ultra short pulse generation not only the ampli-
tudes but also the harmonic phases are of importance.
The calculations presented above show that all harmonics
are phase locked. This means that after proper ﬁltering
they can produce a pulse of duration T , such that

Eq. (45) presents a new result. Notice that the plasma
boundary never moves with a relativistic γ-factor larger
than γmax. Consequently, the frequency of a photon re-
ﬂected from this boundary due to the relativistic Doppler
eﬀect does not exceed 4γ2
maxω0 = ncrω0. How can a pulse
with duration T given by Eq. (45) be produced then?

Mathematically this can be understood looking at the
properties of the Airy function. Ai(x) changes its behav-

point approach due to saddle point overlapping.

VII. RELATIVISTIC SPIKES AND CUT-OFF
OF THE HIGH HARMONIC SPECTRUM

The γ3

scaling of the spectrum cutoﬀ (1) is readily
understood using the relativistic γ-factor spikes of the
plasma surface motion. Indeed, the plasma surface ve-
locity in the vicinity of a maximum can be approximated
as

cutoﬀ (1). This cutoﬀ should be compared with the one
predicted by the ”oscillating mirror” model: 4γ2

diﬀers parametrically from the correct cutoﬀ

which is due to the relativistic γ-factor spikes.

√8αγ3

As it has been shown, the ”oscillating mirror” model
gives the incorrect formula for the spectrum cutoﬀ be-
cause it does not include the relativistic γ-factor spikes.
Mathematically, this failure ”oscillating mirror” model is
related to the saddle point overlapping. Eq. (26) deﬁnes
the saddle points

the vicinity of which determines the value of the integral
describing the amplitude of the n-th harmonic, n

see Fig. 4. Eq. (27) yields that the set of Eqs. (53) has real
(not imaginary) solutions only for n < ncr = 4γ2
max. For
larger n all of the saddle points of (53) have an imaginary
part.

≫

Let us now apply the standard saddle point method
to the problem without investigating whether the condi-
tions for its applicability are met (it is clear that these
conditions are violated at least for n
ncr, for which
two saddle points coincide). This approximation predicts
ncr the spectrum decays as 1/n5/2. For
that for 1
n > ncr this approach restores Eq. (47).

n

As it was mentioned above the spectrum 1/n5/2 occurs
formally in the limit (αn)1/3 < 1. In other words, if α
were small, this spectrum would be observed. However,
since α depends on S rather than a0, this spectrum cor-
responds to harmonics with small numbers only and is
hardly of any practical interest. On the other hand, one
can notice that α describes the plasma surface accelera-
tion at the maximum of the velocity. This means that the
limit of small α (and the spectrum 1/n5/2) describes the
limit of the surface moving without acceleration. How-
ever, this limit is of little interest for large a0.

A pulse of such duration contains frequencies

As we have seen, the relativistic plasma harmonics are
phase locked and can be used to generate ultra short
pulses. However, to extract these ultra short pulses, one
has to remove the lower harmonics. The high energy
cutoﬀ (1) of the power law spectrum deﬁnes the shortest
pulse duration that can be achieved this way.

Let us apply a high-frequency ﬁlter that suppresses all
harmonics with frequencies below Ωf and study how the
relative position of the Ωf and the spectrum cutoﬀ aﬀects
the duration of the resulting (sub)attosecond pulses.

According to Eq. (34), the electric ﬁeld of the pulse

Th amplitude of these pulses decreases fast when Ωf

not depend on Ωf . Since the fundamental frequency
of the pulse grows as Ωf , the pulses obtained with an
above-cutoﬀ ﬁlter are ﬁlled with electric ﬁeld oscillations.
Therefore these pulses are suitable to study the resonance

due to several spikes. These spikes contribute to (28)

leads to modulations in the high harmonic spectrum.
As an example we consider the interference between the
harmonics produced by two diﬀerent spikes in detail.

X. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In order to check our analytical results, we have
performed a number of 1d PIC simulations with the
1d particle-in-cell code VLPL [18].
In all simula-
tions a laser pulse with the Gaussian envelope a =
a0 exp
cos (ω0t), duration ω0τL = 4π and di-
mensionless vector potential a0 = 20 was incident onto a

oscillatory motion of the point xARP(t). The equilibrium
position is displaced from the initial plasma boundary
position xR due to the mean laser light pressure.

Since only the ARP motion towards the laser pulse is
of importance for the high harmonic generation, we cut
out the negative ARP velocities vARP(t) = dxARP(t)/dt
and calculate only the positive ones (Fig. 5b). The corre-
vARP(t)2/c2 is pre-
sponding γ-factor γARP(t) = 1/
sented in Fig. 5c. Notice that the ARP velocity is a
smooth function. At the same time, the γ-factor γARP(t)
contains sharp spikes, which coincide with the velocity
extrema. These numerical results conﬁrm the predictions
of the ultra relativistic similarity theory, which were pre-
sented in Section III.

B. High harmonic spectrum

≈

For the same laser-plasma parameters (a0 = 20, Ne =
90Nc) the spectrum of high harmonic radiation is pre-
sented in Fig. 6. The maximum γ
factor of the ap-
parent reﬂection point in this numerical simulation is
γmax
3.3 (compare with Fig. 5). Consequently the
maximal harmonic number predicted by the ”oscillating
mirror” model lies at 4γ2
40, while the harmonic
max ≈
cutoﬀ predicted by the relativistic spikes is about 100.
Fig. 6 clearly demonstrates that there is no change of the
spectrum behavior at 4γ2
max, while steeper decay takes
place above 100, as predicted by our theory. Also, the
spectral intensity modulations discussed in Section V and
[3, 19] are observed.

A. Apparent Reﬂection Point

First, we study the oscillatory motion of the plasma
and the dynamics of the apparent reﬂection point de-
ﬁned by the boundary condition (16) [20]. The plasma
slab is initially positioned between xR =
1.5λ and
3.9λ, where λ = 2π/ω0 is the laser wavelength.
xL =
The laser pulse has the amplitude a0 = 20. The plasma
density is Ne/Nc = 90 (S = 4.5).

and zeptosecond (1zs = 10−21s) pulses can be generated.
The temporal proﬁle of the reﬂected radiation is shown
in Fig. 8. When no spectral ﬁlter is applied, Fig. 8a, a

pulses. Its full width at half maximum is about 300 zs.
At the same time its intensity normalized to the laser
frequency is huge (eEzs/mcω)2
14. This corresponds
to the intensity Izs ≈

≈
1019 W/cm2.

D. Filter threshold and the attosecond pulse
structure

The dependence of the short pulses on the position
of the ﬁlter also can be studied numerically. We apply
a ﬁlter with the ﬁlter function f (ω) = 1 + tanh((ω
−
Ωf )/∆ω). It passes through frequencies above Ωf and
suppresses lower frequencies. We choose the similation
case of laser vector potential a0 = 20 and plasma density
Ne = 90Nc. The spectrum of high harmonics is given in
Fig. 6.

FIG. 9: Dependence of the pulses ﬁlling on the position of
the sharp ﬁlter boundary for a0 = 20 and Ne = 90Nc and
ﬁlter positions: a) Ωf = 20ω0, ∆ω = 2ω0; b) Ωf = 40ω0,
∆ω = 2ω0; c) Ωf = 100ω0, ∆ω = 2ω0; d) Ωf = 200ω0,
∆ω = 2ω0

We zoom in to one of the pulses in the pulse train ob-
tained and study how the shape of this one pulse changes
with Ωf . Fig. 9 represents the pulse behavior for four dif-
ferent positions of Ωf . We measure the degree of ﬁllness
of the pulse by the number of ﬁeld oscillations within the
FWHM. One clearly sees that for ﬁlter threshold below
the cutoﬀ frequency, Fig. 9 a), b), the pulse is hollow.
Notice that the case of Fig. 9b corresponds to the cutoﬀ
frequency predicted by the ”oscillating mirror” model.
Only for ﬁlter threshold positions above the spectrum
cutoﬀ given by (1) the pulse becomes ﬁlled, Fig. 9c,d.
These results conﬁrm once again the real position of the
harmonic cutoﬀ.

XI. DISCUSSIONS

In this work we have shown analytically and numeri-
cally that the relativistic γ-factor spikes are the physical
cause for high harmonic generation at the boundary of
overdense plasma. It is important that the properties of

w
w
these spikes are universal and follow from the ultra rel-
ativistic similarity theory. The universal physics of the
relativistic γ-spikes inheres in the universality of the high
harmonic spectrum.

The spectrum of the high harmonics contains the
1/n8/3, which goes till the cutoﬀ at
power law part In ∝
√8αγ3
max. Here γmax is the maximal γ-factor and α de-
scribes the acceleration of the plasma boundary. This re-
sult demonstrates that a naive ”oscillating mirror” model
is insuﬃcient for correct treatment of high harmonic gen-
eration at plasma boundaries.

The acceleration of ions in the interaction of high intensity laser pulses with overdense plasmas
is investigated with particle-in-cell simulations. For circular polarization of the laser pulses, high-
density ion bunches moving into the plasma are generated at the laser-plasma interaction surface.
A simple analytical model accounts for the numerical observations and provides scaling laws for the
ion bunch energy and generation time as a function of pulse intensity and plasma density. In two
spatial dimensions, ion bunch formation coexists with hole boring and surface rippling.

The study of the interactions between ultra-intense
laser pulses and plasmas has proved to be a very rich soil
where technological progress and fundamental physics
meet each other. Particularly intriguing is the concept of
laser-plasma based ion acceleration. From astrophysics
[1], to medical hadrontherapy [2], from proton radiog-
raphy [3], to nuclear physics [4], from proton imaging
techniques [5], to nuclear fusion [6], the problem of ac-
celerating and manipulating charged particles with laser-
plasma interactions oﬀers a series of challenges ranging
from fundamental to applied physics, thus a clear un-
derstanding of the basic laser-plasma acceleration mech-
anisms is mandatory. Several recent experiments have
reported the observation of energetic ions from solid tar-
gets [7, 8]. Some possible acceleration mechanisms are
brieﬂy summarized in Ref.[8]. It is still a matter of de-
bate whether the ions are mainly accelerated at the rear
surface of the target (by the ﬁeld generated by fast elec-
trons escaping in vacuum [9]) or at the front surface in-
volving phenomena such as acceleration by a collisionless
electrostatic shock [10, 11, 12], by a solitary wave [13] or
by ion trapping in a propagating double layer [14].

In this work we elucidate an even more basic process of
ion acceleration in cold plasmas, purely related to the for-
mation of an electrostatic ﬁeld due to the action of the
laser ponderomotive force on the electrons and, conse-
quently, on the ions via space charge displacement. This
investigation shows both the necessity of a kinetic de-
scription of this process and the fundamental role played
by the laser light polarization by showing the diﬀerences
between circular and linear one.
It will be shown by
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that circularly polar-
ized light gives rise to a “pulsed”acceleration and pro-
duces ion bunches directed into the target. A simple
analytical model will be presented that explains the ac-
celeration dynamics and also allows for the deduction of
scaling laws that relate the interaction parameters to the
energy acquired by the ions. With respect to other con-
cepts for laser ion acceleration, the present mechanism
with circularly polarized light leads to very high densi-
ties in the bunches, as might be of interest for problems

of compression and acceleration of high–density matter.
We consider the case of laser radiation impinging on
a cold, step–boundary, overdense plasma with n0/nc =
ω2
p/ω2
L > 1, where n0 is the initial electron density,
L/4πe2 is the critical density for a laser with
nc = meω2
carrier frequency ωL, ωp is the plasma frequency and me,
e are the electron mass and charge. The laser ﬁeld ampli-
tude will be given in units of the dimensionless parameter
aL = (eEL/meωLc). In the PIC simulations, the resolu-
tion is high enough to resolve low density regions, sharp
gradients and the dynamics of both electrons and ions by
taking at least 20 particles per cell at ne = nc and a spa-
tial resolution better than 0.1dp where dp = c/ωp. For
reference, in all simulations shown the target boundary
is located at x = 0 and the laser impinges on it at t = 0.
The essential features of the generation of ion bunches
can be seen from a one–dimensional (1D) simulation.
The laser pulse is circularly polarized, incident from the
left side and propagating along the x axis; its amplitude
rises for 6TL (where TL = 2π/ωL is the laser period) up to
the value aL = 2 and then remains constant. The plasma
has a slab proﬁle with n0 = 5nc and thickness ℓ = 2λL.
Electrons and ions are assumed to be cold, Te = Ti = 0,
and ion charge and mass number are Z = 1, A = 1.

Fig. 1 shows the ion density proﬁles and (x, px) phase
space projections at diﬀerent times. At t = 8TL a sharp
peak of the ion density reaching up to seven times the
initial value is shown which moves inwards the plasma
with an average velocity of about 0.013c leaving behind
a low–density shelf with velocity linearly decreasing [15].
At t = 12TL, after the density at the peak has reached
the maximum value of about 7n0 and the velocity has
reached the value of 0.02c, a second density peak has
appeared on the right of the ﬁrst peak and moves into
the plasma at the speed of about 0.04c with the (x, px)
distribution now clearly a two–valued function of x.

A simple model for this ion bunch generation can be in-
ferred. When the laser pulse impinges on the plasma sur-
face, electrons are quickly pushed inward by the steady
ponderomotive force and pile up leaving behind a charge
depletion layer and giving rise to an electrostatic ﬁeld

gion, see Fig.2.
(A somewhat similar model was used
in Ref.[16] to study the relativistic transparency of the
plasma). The parameters E0, np0, d and ls are related
by the equations E0 = 4πen0d (due to Poisson equa-
tion), n0(d + ls) = np0ls (due to the constraint of global
charge conservation), and E0en0ls/2 ≃ 2IL/c (due to
the balance between the total radiation pressure and the
electrostatic force per unit area).

The electrostatic ﬁeld on the ions starting at initial
positions x0 < d is a constant over the trajectories of the
ions, Ex = Ex(x0), and increases with x0. Thus, these
ions will never reach those with x0 > d, the ion density
will decrease and a ion “shelf” will be formed, the ﬁeld
on the leftmost ion layer being zero. As for the ions with
initial position in the compression region d < x0 < d + ls,
assuming that the electrostatic ﬁeld is a function of x0
for these ions too is consistent with the assumption that
the electrons follow a quasi–equilibrium dynamics and
the ponderomotive force equals the electrostatic ﬁeld at
any time, the total pressure being always 2IL/c. Being
the electrostatic ﬁeld a linear function of x0, all ions will
reach the point B at the same time and the ion density
the hydrody-
will assume an inﬁnite value there, i.e.
namic description breaks down. The ion bunch is thus
due to accelerated ions that cross the point B and are
injected into the unperturbed plasma region, where they
can move ballistically provided that the charge unbalance
is neutralized by electrons accompanying the bunch.

e

The point B where the ﬁeld vanishes does not move
during compression according to this model. Actually,
since for the evanescence length ls we expect ls ≃ dp ∼
n−1/2
, during the compression of the ion ﬂuid the ﬁeld
will tend to penetrate deeper into the plasma keeping the
ﬁeld at the surface and the total electrostatic pressure
constant. Thus, ions beyond point A will be accelerated
by a ﬁeld decreasing in time and will get to the breaking
point later. This qualitatively explains the decreasing
ion density after the bunch front formed by the fastest
ions. This eﬀect also leads to the formation of a spatially
localized ion bunch or, in more than one dimension, of a
thin ion front.

Our model thus gives a scenario in qualitative agree-
ment with the numerical observations and also gives
quantitative estimates and scaling laws. Denoting as
x0 = ζ0 +d the initial position of an ion with mass mi and
charge qi in the compression region, (0 < ζ0 < ls), the
force acting on this ion is given by Fi = qiE0(1 − ζ0/ls).
The velocity of an initially immobile ion, after a sim-
ple integration is vi = (qiE0/mi)(1 − ζ0/ls)t and thus
the position is xi = (qiE0/2mi)(1 − ζ0/ls)t2 + x0. The
“breaking” time at which all ions reach point B is τi =
2lsmi/qiE0. The maximum velocity is thus vmax =
2lsqiE0/mi = 2va, being va = ls/τi the average ion
p
velocity. Thus, while the laser front moves inwards with
p
velocity va, the model predicts that the fastest ions will

reach an equilibrium position where Ex balances the
ponderomotive force exactly. Let us take for simplic-
ity a linear proﬁle of Ex both in the depletion layer
(Ex = E0x/d for 0 < x < d) and in the compression
region (Ex = E0[1 − (x − d)/ls] for d < x < d + ls),
which implies a uniform electron density np0 in this re-

single bunch of ions with velocity ≈ 0.017c is produced at
t ≈ 5.5TL and leaves the target from the back side. The
analytical model for these parameters predicts vmax =
0.0165c. The ion bunch charge is completely neutralized
by electrons both inside and outside the target.

The mechanism of ion bunch formation outlined above
works cleanly for circular laser polarization. For lin-
ear polarization the oscillating part of the v × B force
causes strong electron heating (up to MeV energies)
which changes the regime of ion acceleration qualita-
tively. Fig. 4 shows results from a simulation with pa-
rameters identical to Fig. 1 but the laser polarization that
was changed to linear. No clear propagating ion bunch as
that of Fig. 1 is observed. The hot electrons form a De-
bye sheath leading to ion acceleration towards vacuum at
the back surface as soon as they reach it while a few ions
are also accelerated from the front surface towards vac-
uum in a similar way (Fig. 4). Near the laser pulse front,
the phase space structures look similar to those gener-
ated by the shock acceleration investigated in Ref.[11] at
higher intensity. For the present parameters, sheath ac-
celeration dominates at the time shown. In contrast, for
circular polarization, it is found that most of the elec-
trons are heated up to energies of a few keV behind the
ion bunch and at the laser–plasma interaction surface.

Notice that in the case of shock acceleration (see e.g.
Ref.[11]) the laser pulse acting as a piston drives a shock
wave into the plasma which reﬂects the ions thus acceler-
ated up to velocities twice the shock speed. In the present
case the fastest ions have twice the piston velocity, i.e.
the velocity of the laser reﬂection surface at the breaking
time, and they come from behind the shock. It is also
worth to notice that the present mechanism of ion bunch
formation must be described in terms of electrostatic and
kinetic eﬀects while a purely hydrodynamic description
is not adequate.

where Z and A are respectively the ion charge and mass
number, and ls ≃ dp has been assumed. The predicted
velocity scaling has been tested via numerical simula-
tions, yielding a rather good agreement with the model,
see Fig. 2. For instance, for the parameters of Fig.1 the
model predicts va/c = 0.021 and τi ≃ 3.4TL; in the sim-
ulation the breaking of the ion front occurs at t ≈ 10TL
which, taking into account the pulse rise time of 6TL, is
in fair agreement with the model prediction.

At the “breaking” of the ion proﬁle with the formation
of the bunch, the equilibrium between the electrostatic
and the ponderomotive forces on electrons is lost and, if
the laser pulse is not over, electrons rearrange themselves
to provide a new equilibrium. The process of bunch for-
mation might then restart although with diﬀerent initial
conditions, so that the simple model is not adequate any-
more for quantitative predictions. In Fig.1 a second wide
bunch actually appears at t ≃ 15TL and then propagates
into the plasma. At later times, bunches with shorter
duration are generated at a higher rate [15].

For potential applications, it is interesting to study the
possibility to produce a single bunch from a thin solid
target. Results for the case of an n0/nc = 100, Z/A =
1/2 target with a thickness ℓ = 0.1λL irradiated by a
short pulse with intensity aL = 5 are shown in Fig. 3.

in such a case the surface rippling may be driven by
v × B-stimulated instabilities [18] which do not occur
for circular polarization. Our preliminary explanation
is as follows: due to the ﬁnite rise time of the pulse,
electrons oscillate with frequency ωp around their quasi-
equilibrium position (Fig.2). Due to the transverse pro-
ﬁle of the laser intensity, the electron start to oscillate
with diﬀerent phases at diﬀerent values of y, leading to
a modulated oscillation. This modulation produces an
imprint in the ion density at later times. A systematic
study of this eﬀect is left for future studies.

We acknowledge useful discussions with S. Atzeni and
F. Pegoraro. Part of the numerical simulations were
performed on the Linux cluster at the CINECA facility
(Bologna, Italy), with the support of the INFM super-
computing initiative.

FIG. 5: (Color online.) Contours of ion density ni/nc from 2D
simulations at t = 15TL (left) and t = 20TL (right). The laser
pulse impinges from the left and has a transverse FWHM of
4λL. All other simulation parameters are the same of Fig. 1.

We performed 2D simulations to show that the mecha-
nism for bunch formation is also at play in more than one
dimension, and in particular in the case of a laser pulse
with a ﬁnite transverse width that bends the plasma sur-
face (hole boring). Fig. 5 shows results for a case where
the laser pulse has a Gaussian intensity proﬁle in the
transverse (y) direction with halfwidth w = 4λL and a
duration τ = 12TL. All other plasma and laser parame-
ters are the same of Fig. 1.

The formation of the ion density structures can be seen
in Fig.5, where the ion density surfaces, normalized to
the initial unperturbed density, are shown at diﬀerent
times during the interaction. A secondary, sickle-shape
ion front is observed that corresponds to the 1D bunches
of the preceding section, its features still in agreement
with the predictions of the simple 1D model.

An additional feature of the 2D simulations is the mod-
ulation and “rippling” of the ion density front that is
well noticeable in Fig.5. Surface rippling has been ob-
served by many authors and has been often attributed
to Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities (RTI) driven by the
surface acceleration. In our simulation the average accel-
eration of the plasma surface (before ion bunch genera-
tion) is a ≈ 9 × 10−4c/TL and the observed wavevector
is k ≈ 2π/(0.5λL), thus the typical RTI growth time
is (ka)−1/2 ≈ 10TL. Although this seems to be consis-
tent with the numerical observations, we believe that the
RTI model is not adequate in this case where electro-
static and kinetic eﬀects must be taken into account. In
our simulation we actually observe that the surface mod-
ulations appear in the electron density sooner than in
the ions density. A similar behavior has been observed
in simulations for linear polarization [17, 18]. However,

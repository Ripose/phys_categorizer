We investigate the existence of the electric ﬁeld reversal in the negative glow of a dc discharge,
its location, the width of the well trapping the electrons, the slow electrons scattering time, and as
well the trapping time. Based on a stress-energy tensor analysis we show the inherent instability
of the well. We suggest that the Fermi mechanism is a possible process for pumping out electrons
from the through, and linking this phenomena with electrostatic plasma instabilities. A power
law distribution function for trapped electrons is also obtained. Analytical expressions are derived
which can be used to calculate these characteristics from geometrical dimensions and the operational
parameters of the discharge.

INTRODUCTION

The phenomena of ﬁeld reversal of the axial electric
ﬁeld in the negative glow of a dc discharge is of great im-
portance, since the fraction of ions returning to the cath-
ode depends on its existence and location. Technological
application of gas discharges, particularly to plasma dis-
play panels, needs a better knowledge of the processes
involved. The study of nonlocal phenomena in electron
kinetics of collisional gas discharge plasma have shown
that in the presence of ﬁeld reversals the bulk electrons
in the cathode plasma are clearly separated in two groups
of slow electrons: trapped and free electrons[1]. Trapped
electrons give no contribution to the current but repre-
sent the majority of the electron population.

The ﬁrst ﬁeld reversal it was shown qualitatively to
be located near the end of the negative glow (NG) where
the plasma density attains the greatest magnitude. If the
discharge length is enough, it appears a second ﬁeld re-
versal on the boundary between the Faraday dark space
and the positive column. Also, it was shown in the pre-
viously referred theoretical work that ions produced to
the left of this ﬁrst reversal location move to the cathode
by ambipolar diﬀusion and ions generated to the right
of this location drift to the anode. For a review see
also [2]. Those characteristic were experimentally ob-
served by laser optogalvanic spectroscopy [3].

Boeuf et al [4] with a simple ﬂuid model gave an analyt-
ical expression of the ﬁeld reversal location which showed
to depend solely on the cathode sheath length, the gap
length, and the ionization relaxation length. They ob-
tained as well a simple analytical expression giving the
fraction of ions returning to the cathode and the magni-
tude of the plasma maximum density.

In the present Letter we introduce a quite simple
dielectric-like model of a plasma-sheath system. This

approach have been addressed by other authors [5, 6] to
explain how the electrical ﬁeld inversion occurs at the
interface between the plasma sheath and the beginning
of the negative glow. The aim of this Letter is to ob-
tain more information about the fundamental properties
related to ﬁeld inversion phenomena in the frame of a
dielectric model. It is obtained a simple analytical de-
pendence of the axial location where ﬁeld reversal occurs
in terms of macroscopic parameters. In addition, it is ob-
tained the magnitude of the minimum electric ﬁeld inside
the through, the trapped well length, and the trapping
time of the slow electrons into the well. We emphasize in
particular the description of the dielectric behavior and
do not contemplate plasma chemistry and plasma-surface
interactions.

The analytical results hereby obtained could be useful
for hybrid ﬂuid-particle models (e.g., Fiala et al. [7]),
since simple criteria can be applied to accurately remove
electrons from the simulations.

On the ground of the stress-energy tensor considera-
tions it is shown the inherent instability of the ﬁeld in-
version sheath. The slow electrons distribution function
is obtained assuming the Fermi [8] mechanism responsi-
ble for their acceleration from the trapping well.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

Lets consider a plasma formed between two parallel-
plate electrodes due to an applied dc electric ﬁeld. We
assume a planar geometry, but extension to cylindrical
geometry is straightforward. The applied voltage is Va
and we assume the cathode fall length is l and the nega-
tive glow + eventually the positive column extends over
the length l0, such that the total length is L = l + l0. We
have

−Va = lEs + l0Ep,

(1)

where Es and Ep are, resp., the electric ﬁelds in the
sheath and NG (possibly including the positive column).

At the end of the cathode sheath it must be veriﬁed the
following boundary condition by the displacement ﬁeld D

Here, σ is the surface charge density accumulated at the
boundary surface and n is the normal to the surface. In
more explicit form,

n.(Dp − Ds) = σ.

εpEp − εsEs = σ.

Here, εs and εp are, resp., the electrical permittivity of
the sheath and the positive column. We have to solve
the following algebraic system of equations

l0Ep + lEs = −Va,
εpEp − εsEs = σ.

case, εp = 1 −
plasma frequency and νen the electron-neutral collision
frequency. In fact, our assumption εs = ε0 is plainly jus-
tiﬁed, since experiments have shown the occurrence of
a signiﬁcant gas heating and a corresponding gas den-
sity reduction in the cathode fall region, mainly due to
symmetric charge exchanges processes which lead to an
eﬃcient conversion of electrical energy to heavy-particle
kinetic energy and thus to heating [9].

Two extreme cases can be considered:

i) ωp > νen,
implying εp < 0, meaning that τcoll > τplasma, i.e, non-
collisional regime prevails; ii) ωp < νen, εp > 0, and then
τcoll > τplasma, i.e, collisional regime dominates.

From the above Eqs. 5 we estimate the ﬁeld inversion
L = 0, which give

Due to the accumulation of slow electrons after a dis-
tance ξc = L − l0, real charges accumulated on a sur-
face separating the cathode fall region from the negative
glow. Naturally, it appears polarization charges on each
side of this surface and a double layer is created with
a surface charge −σ′
1 < 0 on the cathode side and σ′

on the anode side. But, σ′ = (P · n), P = ε0χeE with
ε = ε0(1 + χe), χe denoting the dimensionless quantity
called electric susceptibility. As the electric displacement
is the same everywhere, we have D0 = D1 = D2. Thus,
the residual (true) surface charge in between is given by

From Eq. 6 we can resume a criteria for ﬁeld reversal: it
only occurs in the non-collisional regime; by the contrary,
in the collisional regime and to the extent of validity of
this simple model, no ﬁeld reversal will occur, since the
slow electrons scattering time inside the well is higher
than the the well lifetime, and collisions (in particular,
coulombian collisions) and trapping become competitive
processes. A similar condition was obtained in [10] when
studying the eﬀect of electron trapping in ion-wave insta-
bility. Likewise, a self-consistent analytic model [1] have
shown that at at suﬃciently high pressure, ﬁeld reversal
is absent.

The magnitude of the minimum electric ﬁeld depends
on the length of the negative glow l0. This also means
that without NG there is no place for ﬁeld reversal, and
also the bigger the length the minor the electric ﬁeld.
The length of the negative glow can be estimated by the
free path length l0 of the fastest electrons possessing an
energy equal to the cathode potential fall value eVa:

It is expected that the potential trough should have a
characteristic width of the order in between the electron

Debye length (λDe =
length. Using Eq. 16, in a He plasma and assuming Va =
1 kV, l0 = 1 m and νen = 1.85 × 109 s−1 (with Te = 0.03
eV) at 1 Torr (n = 3.22 × 1016 cm−3) we estimate ∆ξ ≈
2.6×10−3 cm, while the Debye length is λDe = 2.4×10−3
cm. So, our Eq. 16 gives a good order of magnitude for
the potential width, which is expected to be in fact of
the same order of magnitude than the Debye length.

Table I present the set of parameters used to obtain
our estimations. We give in Table II the estimate of the
minimum electric ﬁeld attained inside the well. The ﬁrst
ﬁeld reversal at ξc ≈ lN G corresponds to the maximum
density new ≫ nep [4, 11]. So, the assumed values for
the ratio of electron temperatures and densities of the
trapped electrons and electrons on the NG are typical
estimates.

It can be shown that there is no ﬁnite conﬁguration
of ﬁelds and plasma that can be in equilibrium without
some external stress [13]. Consequently, this trough is
dim to be unstable and burst electrons periodically (or

the main plasma. This phenomena produces local pertur-
bation in the ionization rate and the electric ﬁeld giving
rise to ionization waves (striations). In the next section,
we will calculate the time of trapping with a simple Brow-
nian model.

From Eq. 6 we calculate the cathode fall length for
some gases. For this purpose we took He and H2 data
as reference for atomic and molecular gases, resp. The
orders of magnitude are the same, with the exception of
Ar. Due to Ramsauer eﬀect direct comparison is diﬃcult.
In Table III it is shown a comparison of the experimen-
tal cathode fall distances to the theoretical prediction, as
given by Eq. 16. Taking into account the limitations of
this model these estimates are well consistent with ex-
perimental data [12].

B. Lifetime of a slow electron in the potential well

The trapped electrons most probably diﬀuse inside
the well with a characteristic time much shorter than
the lifetime of the through. Trapping can be avoided
by Coulomb collisions [10] or by the ion-wave instabil-
ity, both probably one outcome of the stress energy un-
balance as previously mentioned. We consider a simple
Brownian motion model for the slow electrons to obtain
the scattering time τ , and the lifetime T of the well. A
Fermi-like model will allow us to obtain the slow electron
energy distribution function.

Considering the slow electron jiggling within the well,

the estimated scattering time is

Here, De is the electron diﬀusion coeﬃcient at thermal
velocities.

The ﬂuctuations arising in the plasma are due to the
breaking of the well and we can estimate the amplitude

C. Power-law slow electrons distribution function

As slow electrons are trapped by the electric ﬁeld inver-
sion, some process must be at work to pull them out from
the well. We suggest that ﬂuctuations of the electric ﬁeld
in the plasma (with order of magnitude of Ec)act over
electrons giving energy to the slow ones, which collide
with those irregularities as with heavy particles. From
this mechanism it results a gain of energy as well a loss.
This model was ﬁrst advanced by E. Fermi [8] when de-
veloping a theory of the origin of cosmic radiation. We
shall focus here on the rate at which energy is acquired.
The average energy gain per collision by the trapped

electrons (in order of magnitude) is given by

∆w = U w(t),

with εt being their thermal energy, typical of slow elec-
trons. The time between scattering collisions is τ . As-
suming a Poisson distribution P (t) for electrons escaping
from the trapping, then we state

P (t) = exp(−t/τ )dt/T.

(22)

The probability distribution of the energy gained is a
function of one random variable (the energy), such as

fw(w)dw = P {w < ¯w < w + dw}.

(23)

This density fw(w) can be determined in terms of the
density P(t). Denoting by t1 = T the real root of the
equation w = w(t1 = T ), then it can be readily shown
that slow electrons obey in fact to the following power-
law distribution function

fw(w)dw =

.

(24)

Like many man made and naturally occurring phenom-
ena (e.g., earthquakes magnitude, distribution of in-

come), it is expected the trapped electron distribution
function to be a power-law (see Eq. 24), hence 1 + τ
c T =
E 2
n, with n = 2 ÷ 4 as a reasonable guess. Hence, we
estimate the trapping time to be

T ≈

.

(25)

Fig.1 shows the slow electrons distribution function
pumped out from the well for two cases: Ar (solid curve),
and N2 (broken curve). It was chosen a power exponent
n = 2. Those distributions show that the higher conﬁn-
ing time is associated with less slow electrons present in
the well. When the width of the well increases (from solid
to broken curve) the scattering time become longer, and
as well the conﬁning time, due to a decrease of the relative
number of slow electrons per given energy. This mecha-
nism of pumping out of slow (trapped) electrons from the
well can possibly explains the generation of electrostatic
plasma instabilities.

Note that the trapping time is, in fact, proportional to
the length of the NG and inversely proportional to the
electrons diﬀusion coeﬃcient at thermal energies:

T ≈

l2
0
De

.

(26)

The survival frequency of trapped electrons is νt = 1/T .
As the electrons diﬀusion coeﬃcient are typically higher
in atomic gases, it is natural to expect plasma instabil-
ities and waves with higher frequencies in atomic gases.
This result is in agreement with a kinetic analysis of in-
stabilities in microwave discharges [14]. In addition, the

5

length of the NG will inﬂuence the magnitude of the fre-
quencies registered by the instabilities, since wavelengths
have more or less space to build-up. Table IV summarizes
the previous results for some atomic and molecular gases.
The transport parameters used therefor where calculated
by solving the electron Boltzmann equation, under the
two-term approximation, in a steady-state Townsend dis-
charge [15]

III. CONCLUSION

We have shown in the framework of a simple dielectric
model that the magnitude of the minimum electric ﬁeld
(on the edge of the negative glow) depends directly on
the applied voltage and is inversely proportional to the
NG length.

The width of the well trapping the slow electrons is
directly dependent on the applied electric ﬁeld and is in-
versely proportional to the square of the electron-neutral
collision frequency for slow electrons. It is, as well, in-
versely proportional to the NG length, and has typically
the extension of a Debye length. We state that for typical
conditions of a low-pressure glow-discharge, ﬁeld reversal
occurs whenever ωp > νen, due to a lack of collisions nec-
essary to pump out electrons from the well. Furthermore,
the analytical expressions obtained for the scattering and
trapping time of the slow electrons are potentially useful
in hybrid ﬂuid-particle plasma modelling.

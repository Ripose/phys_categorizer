Current-sheet formation in incompressible electron magnetohydrodynamics

V.P. Ruban∗
L.D.Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, 2 Kosygin Street, 117334 Moscow, Russia†
(Dated: February 28, 2013)

It is shown that in the framework of the ideal incompressible electron magnetohydrodynamics,
the motion of suﬃciently large-scale axisymmetric vortex structures with zero azimuthal velocity
can be eﬀectively described by the exactly solvable Hopf equation. Breaking of the magnetic ﬁeld
proﬁle in the solutions corresponds to the beginning of current-sheet formation. Nonlinear dispersive
corrections to this equation are derived.

PACS numbers: 52.30.Cv, 52.30.Ex

It is a well known fact that current sheets play ex-
clusively important role in plasma dynamics (see, for in-
stance, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and references therein). These
singular quasi-two-dimensional structures can arise spon-
taneously in a conductive medium as the result of devel-
opment of instabilities. Near such objects the most in-
tensive plasma heating occurs, i.e., the main dissipation
of the magnetic energy takes place.
In a large degree,
many other statistical properties of the system are deter-
mined by current sheets, for instance, structure functions
of the magnetic ﬁeld and correlation functions between
the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds [6, 7]. Therefore, these
objects have attracted much attention. However, ana-
lytical investigation of the current sheets formation and
their dissipative dynamics is very diﬃcult in the frame-
work of usually used nonlinear (and also nonlocal in the
incompressible limit) three-dimensional equations of mo-
tion of plasma. That concerns the usual magnetohydro-
dynamics (MHD), the electron magnetohydrodynamics
(EMHD), as well as the multi-ﬂuid models of plasma. So,
up today we do not have a mathematically clear answer
on the question whether the current density will become
singular in a ﬁnite time or its growth can be only expo-
nential. Numerical simulations remain to be the main
tool for obtaining quantitative results in these systems
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Therefore, an important role for theoretical
understanding of current sheets dynamics can be played
by local approximations, which sometimes provide exact
solutions describing formation of singularities.

It this work, a naturally obtained, relatively simple,
approximate diﬀerential equation is discussed, that de-
scribes the motion of vortex structures in EMHD on
length scales much larger than the electron skin-depth.
In these conditions, the main part of the energy is con-
centrated in the magnetic ﬁeld, with the kinetic energy
of the electron ﬂuid motion being much smaller. Because
of this reason, the equation of motion becomes eﬀectively
local. It is very important that in the dissipationless limit
it is possible to ﬁnd its general solution for the case of ax-

Laboratory, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark

isymmetric ﬂows with zero azimuthal component of the
velocity. In this geometry, the equation of motion is re-
duced to the well known exactly solvable one-dimensional
Hopf equation, which should be solved for each value of
the radial coordinate. The solutions obtained are inter-
esting both from theoretical and practical points of view,
inasmuch as they describe such experimentally observed
objects as current channels, and also magnetic rings. The
mechanism of the singularity formation in these solutions
is connected simply with breaking in a ﬁnite time of the
proﬁle of a function depending on two spatial variables,
which is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic
ﬁeld itself does not become inﬁnite, but its curl tends to
the inﬁnity at some point of the axial cross-section. In-
clusion of dissipative and nonlinear dispersive terms into
the equation, as it often occurs, stops the breaking, but
instead of multi-valued proﬁle, a shock forms, the length
of which increasing with time. The shock is the cross-
section of a current sheet having in this case the axial
symmetry. Probably, in the absence of this symmetry
the qualitative picture remains the same and the current
sheet formation may be described approximately as the
breaking of some function proﬁle.

In order to understand clearly the conditions for ap-
plicability of the approximate diﬀerential equation sug-
gested later, Eq.(15), it is useful to recall the place of
EMHD among diﬀerent hydrodynamical plasma models.
If there are only two kinds of particles in the plasma —
negatively charged electrons with the mass m and with
the electric charge
e, and positively charged ions with
the mass M and with the charge +e, then the most gen-
eral is the two-ﬂuid model, which contains MHD, EMHD,
and Hall MHD as special cases. Let the equilibrium con-
centration of the particles of each sort is equal to n. If the
B2
temperature of the system is suﬃciently large, nT
(B is the magnetic ﬁeld), then for slow ﬂows one can ne-
glect deviations of the concentrations from n (the quasi-
neutrality condition), and belive the velocity ﬁelds to be
divergence-free: (

v±) = 0.

Temporary, we will not take into account dissipative
processes. Thus, application of the canonical formalism
becomes possible [8, 9, 10]. With appropriate choice for

Here µ = m/M is the ratio of the electron mass to the ion
mass, the only dimensionless parameter remaining in the
system. For the electron-positron plasma µ = 1, for the
hydrogen plasma µ
1. Below we consider
the latter case. The ﬁrst two terms in the expression
(1) give the kinetic energy of the ion and electron ﬂuids,
while the third term is the energy of the magnetic ﬁeld
created by the ﬂows of electrically charged ﬂuids. The
conditions of incompressibility are assumed, (v±
k) = 0.

It is important that the variation of the action func-
Lµdt, which is necessary for constituting
tional S =
the equations of motion, should not be preformed with
respect to the variations δv±(r, t), but with respect to
the variations δx+(a, t) and δx−(c, t), where x+(a, t)
and x−(c, t) are incompressible Lagrangian mappings de-
scribing the motion of points of the ion and electron
ﬂuids, labeled by the labels a and c. The correspond-
ing mathematical technique is explained, for instance, in
Refs.
[11, 12, 13]. The equations of motion of the two-

Depending on the typical spatial scale of the vortices,
several dynamical regimes are possible in this system.
The small and moderate wave number region, k <

the magnetic eﬀects become unsigniﬁcant, and the sys-
tem (11) is broken into two weakly interacting subsys-
tems, each of them being described by the ordinary Eu-
lerian hydrodynamics.

Let us consider the subset of the solutions, for which
the ion vorticity is identically equal to zero, Ω+ = 0, and
the electron vorticity Ω−

20. For EMHD it is the long-scale region, where Ω− is
proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld in the leading order.
It should be emphasized that with Ω+ = 0 the velocity
v+ of the ion component is not exactly zero, however,
it is much smaller than the velocity v− of the electron
component, as it becomes clear from consideration of the
formulae (5) and (6) with p+ = 0. In the main approxi-

structed from the initial function ω

of each level contour ω
0 (q, z) = w along z-axis on the
value 2wt. It is clear that in the typical case a breaking
of the proﬁle of the dependence ω−(q, z, t) takes place
after a ﬁnite time. Additional dissipative and nonlin-
ear dispersive terms in the equation of motion would
result in stopping the breaking process and arising of
a relatively sharp shock in the function ω−(q, z, t).
It
is clear therefore that immediately before the moment
of the singularity formation, the equation (15) becomes
non-applicable. Sometimes it is suﬃcient to add into the
r.h.s. of the equation (15) the only linear dissipative term
(e2n/M σ)∆Ω−, which takes into account a ﬁnite electri-

Let us note in the conclusion that the equation (15) is
interesting also from the more general theoretical view-

point. This is an example of a 3D hydrodynamic type
system, where the singularity formation explicitly takes
place in a ﬁnite time. However, the above described
mechanism for the singularity formation can not be uni-
versal for all the hydrodynamical systems. For example,
it is known that in solutions of the Euler equation no
singularity can form in a ﬁnite time without maximum
of the vorticity growing to the inﬁnity [14]. Simultane-
ously, the ﬁeld of the vorticity direction must loose the
smoothness at the singular point[15, 16]. But in the case
considered here no of these two conditions is satisﬁed,
but nevertheless, the singularity develops in a ﬁnite time.
We may suppose that the type of a possible singularity
in some hydrodynamic system depends on the behavior
of the corresponding Green’s function at large k. In Eu-
lerian hydrodynamics G(k) = 1/k2, while in the model
(15) we have G(k) = 1.

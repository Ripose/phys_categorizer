Bounds on the Mobility of Electrons in Weakly Ionized Plasmas

Abstract

We obtain exact upper and lower bounds on the steady state drift velocity, and
kinetic energy of electrons, driven by an external ﬁeld in a weakly ionized plasma (swarm
approximation). The scattering is assumed to be elastic with simpliﬁed velocity dependence
of the collision cross sections. When the ﬁeld is large the bounds are close to each other and
to the results obtained from the conventional approximation of the Boltzmann equation
in which one keeps only the ﬁrst two terms of a Legendre expansion. The bounds prove
rigorously that it is possible to increase the electron mobility by the addition of suitably
chosen scatterers to the system as predicted by the Druyvesteyn approximation and found
in experiments.

I. Introduction

The behavior of the electron mobility in a gas composed of several species is a subject
of continued experimental and theoretical investigations [1-4]. Of particular interest is
the fact that the addition of certain types of scatterers, i.e. neutral species, to the gas
increases the electron mobility and therefore the electron current in an applied electric
ﬁeld [3,4]. This eﬀect is potentially of practical utility and, as was pointed out by Nagpal
and Garscadden [4], can be used to obtain information about scattering cross sections and
level structure of diﬀerent species.

The fact that the mobility can actually increase with the addition of scatterers is at
ﬁrst surprising: it is contrary to the well known Matthiessen rule in metals which states
that the total resistivity due to diﬀerent types of scatterers is the sum of resistivities due

1

to each of them [5]. A closer inspection shows that Matthiessen’s rule refers to the linear
regime of small electric ﬁelds while the observations and analysis in gases [3,4] are in the
nonlinear high ﬁeld regime.

This still leaves open the question of the validity of approximations commonly made in
calculating the current of weakly ionized plasmas in strong ﬁelds. We therefore investigate
here rigorously the stationary solutions of the kinetic equation for the electron velocity
distribution function in cases where the electron-neutral (e-n) collisions are purely elastic
and their cross section is modeled by a simple power dependence on the electron speed.
In particular we establish two-sided bounds for the electron mean energy and drift in
the presence of an external electric ﬁeld. These bounds show that the results obtained
for the current and energy of the electrons in the usual approximation, which neglects
higher order terms in a Legendre polynomial expansion and gives the Druyvesteyn-like
distribution for large ﬁelds, are qualitatively right and even provide good quantitative
answers. In fact they are suﬃciently precise to conﬁrm an increase in the current for large
(but not for small) ﬁelds upon addition of some gases, provided the mass of the added
species is smaller than that of the dominant one, e.g. adding Helium to an Xenon gas, and
the diﬀerent cross sections satisfy certain conditions. We believe that our analysis can be
extended to include more realistic elastic cross sections and inelastic collisions; these are
most important in practice for enhancement of the electron mobility.

II. Kinetic Equation

Our starting point is the commonly used swarm approximation, applicable to gases
with a very small degree of ionization, [6-10]. In this approximation only e-n collisions
are taken into account in the kinetic equation for the electron distribution function (EDF)
f (r, v, t). The neutrals themselves, which may consist of several species, are assumed
to have a Maxwellian distribution with a speciﬁed common temperature Tn. Further
simpliﬁcation is achieved if the e-n collisions are assumed to be essentially elastic: the
collision integral can then be reduced [1,6] to a diﬀerential operator due to the great
diﬀerence in the masses of the electrons and neutrals. To simplify matters further we
consider the case where the scattering is spherically symmetric. The stationary kinetic
equation for the normalized EDF, in a spatially uniform system with constant density n
subject to an external electric ﬁeld F , can then be written in the form [6]

0 the collisions almost do not change the electron energy
to E. On the other hand if ǫ
so it is diﬃcult for the electrons to get rid of the energy they acquire from the ﬁeld. The
limit ǫ

state for ǫ = 0 about which to expand the solution of (2).

V. Mobility in Binary Mixtures

The increase of electron mobility w/F in a plasma upon the addition of a small
amount of a new gas has been observed in [3]. It was calculated in [4] within the two-term
approximation (8), (9) for binary mixtures of a heavy noble Ramsauer gas and Helium
addition. We shall show here rigorously that this eﬀect exists even with constant collision
cross sections. Using (11) gives

Let us consider now the case of a strong ﬁeld, kT0 << eF λ/√ǫ, for a binary mixture
i = 1, 2 and use the two-term ansatz (8), (9). We then have the Druyvesteyn distribution
(10) with the moments (26). Using (14) and the notation

Both the current and energy of electrons increase, but the mobility w/F decreases, as the
ﬁeld F increases..

Let us now keep the total gas density N1 + N2 constant and vary the relative
concentration of components by changing α. A simple analysis of (31) shows that w
can be non-monotone when both θ and µ are larger than 1. For example, if θ = 5, µ = 20
then considering w as a function of α, w = w(α), we have

Here w(αm) is the maximum value of w obtained for αm ≈
the same in the pure species 1 and 2, but it is noticeably larger in a mixture. The mean
energy of electrons changes more: when the lighter component substitutes for the heavier
one it goes down:

We obtained these results approximately - by truncating the series (5). However
comparing (26) with the bounds (24) we see that the drift velocity and mean energy for
the Druyvesteyn approximation cannot diﬀer from the exact solution by more than about
+12,
17% respectively. Hence the non-monotone dependence of the electron
mobility on the density of the light species holds for the exact solution of the kinetic
1.40w(0) (within the approximation) a possible
equation (2). When we had wmax ≈
exaggeration of wmax by 12% and underestimation of w(0) at most in 6% could reduce
their ratio from 1.40 to 1.16 but the eﬀect is clearly there without approximations.

±

−

The explanation of such unusual behavior of the electron drift in the nonlinear regime
is quite simple. When M2 < M1 the addition of species 2 makes the energy transfer from
the electrons to atoms easier in the elastic collisions. Consequently the mean electron
energy W will drop leading to a net increase of the mean free time τ (v)
λ/v. The
competition of λ and v is shown by formulas (31) and (33) where α, δ represent the
concentration of the lighter species and µ is proportional to its relative eﬀectiveness in
0.05m1
the energy transfer. Adding about 10% of a component with atoms of mass m2 ∼
the mean electron energy decreases by about 1/2 implying the increase of w by about 40%.
This rise of the electron mobility can be stronger [4] in the case when the collision
cross section of the main (heavy) component is energy dependent and decreases with the
electron energy.

Methods similar to those in the Section 2 allow us to derive the pair of equations for

The bounds in (40) for the drift and energy as functions of the parameter p are shown

two-term approximation for our models is quite good.

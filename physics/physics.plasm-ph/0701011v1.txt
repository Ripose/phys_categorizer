Abstract

We construct an inﬁnite family of one-dimensional equilibrium so-
lutions for purely magnetized quantum plasmas described by the quan-
tum hydrodynamic model. The equilibria depends on the solution of
a third-order ordinary diﬀerential equation, which is written in terms
of two free functions. One of these free functions is associated to the
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration, while the other is speciﬁed by an equa-
tion of state. The case of a Harris sheet type magnetic ﬁeld, together
with an isothermal distribution, is treated in detail. In contrast to the
classical Harris sheet solution, the quantum case exhibits an oscilla-
tory pattern for the density.

1 Introduction

Quantum plasmas have attracted renewed attention in the last years, due e.g.
to the relevance of quantum eﬀects in ultra-small semiconductor devices [1],
dense plasmas [2] and very intense laser plasmas [3]. The most recent devel-
opments in collective eﬀects in quantum plasmas comprises wave propagation

in dusty plasmas [4]-[9], soliton and vortex solutions [10, 11], shielding eﬀects
[12, 13], modulational instabilities [14] and spin eﬀects [15]. Most of these
works have been made using the hydrodynamic model for quantum plasmas
[16]-[20], in contrast to more traditional approaches based on kinetic descrip-
tions [21]. Microscopic descriptions like coupled Schr¨odinger equations or
Wigner function approaches are more expensive, both numerically and ana-
lytically, specially if magnetic ﬁelds are allowed. For a general review on the
available quantum plasma models, see [22].

The electrostatic ﬂuid model for quantum plasmas have been recently
extended to incorporate magnetic ﬁelds [23]. The new quantum hydrody-
namic model was derived taking the ﬁrst two moments of the electromag-
netic Wigner equation, which is the quantum counterpart of the correspond-
ing Vlasov equation, and assuming a closure condition p = p(n). In other
words, the procedure is formally the same as for classical plasma ﬂuid de-
scriptions, while now the starting point is the Wigner-Maxwell and not the
Vlasov-Maxwell system. The electromagnetic quantum ﬂuid model has been
already used for the analysis of shear Alfv´en modes in ultra-cold quantum
magnetoplasmas [24], the description of drift modes in nonuniform quantum
magnetoplasmas [25] and of shear electromagnetic waves in electron-positron
plasmas [26]. Instead of the discussion of wave propagation in quantum plas-
mas, the aim of this letter is the analysis of some simple quantum magneto-
static equilibria resembling the well known Harris proﬁle for classical plasma
[27].

All the symbols in eqs. (1-2) have their conventional meaning and the system
is supplemented by Maxwell equations. Only electrons are considered, the

2

ions being described by a convenient immobile background. Notice the extra
2
dispersive term, proportional to ¯h
, at the moment transport equation. This
Bohm potential term has profound consequences on the structure of the
equilibrium solutions, as we shall see in the following.

Speciﬁcally, consider a purely magnetic one-dimensional class of time-

independent solutions characterized by zero electric ﬁeld and

B = By(x)ˆy + Bz(x)ˆz ,
n = n(x) ,
u = uy(x)ˆy + uz(x)ˆz ,
p = p(n) .

The magnetic ﬁeld can be given in terms of a vector potential A = Ay(x)ˆy +
Az(x)ˆz, so that By =
dAz/dx and Bz = dAy/dx. Notice that the ﬂuid
model is suitable for the search for static quantum equilibria since the kinetic
(Wigner) equation is not satisﬁed by arbitrary functions of the invariants of
motion as for Vlasov plasmas. Therefore we are not allowed to use Jeans
theorem for the construction of equilibria.

Neutrality is enforced by an appropriate immobile ionic background de-
scribed by an ionic density ni(x). Therefore, Poisson’s equation can be ig-
nored. Now inserting the form (3) into Amp`ere’s law and the quantum ﬂuid
equations gives

As in the classical situation [28],

it is useful to restrict to the cases
where the magnetic ﬁeld is indirectly deﬁned through a pseudo-potential
V = V (Ay, Az) for which

In this system, x plays the rˆole of time, while the components of the vector
potential play the rˆole of spatial coordinates. After specifying the pseudo-
potential V and solving eqs. (9-10), we regain the magnetic ﬁeld using B =

A. The current then follows from eqs. (7-8).

∇ ×

The choice expressed at eqs. (7-8) imposes a restriction on the classes
of equilibria, since not all density and velocity ﬁelds can be cast in this
potential form. However, introducing the pseudo-potential V has at least two
advantages. First, we can learn from Hamiltonian dynamics how to design
speciﬁc pseudo-potentials V in order to obtain special classes of magnetic
ﬁelds. For instance, periodic magnetic ﬁelds can be easily obtained from well
known potentials associated to periodic solutions. Second, the formalism
becomes more compact in terms of the function V .

In terms of V , the balance eq. (6) reads

It can be shown that, apart from an irrelevant numerical constant, the
2/2,
pseudo-potential V is directly related to magnetic pressure, V =
showing that the left-hand side of eq.
(11) refers to the usual (classical)
pressure balance equation. The right-hand side, however, has a pure quan-
tum nature. Not only there must be a balance between kinetic and magnetic
pressures, since the quantum pressure arising from the Bohm potential term
in
has to be taken into account. This quantum pressure manifests e.g.
the dispersion of wave-packets in standard quantum mechanics. In plasmas,
the quantum pressure is responsible for subtle eﬀects like in the case of the
quantum two-stream instability, where the instability is magniﬁed for small
wave-numbers and suppressed for large wave-numbers [16, 20].

In the quantum case where ¯h

= 0, eq. (11) is a third-order ODE for the
density. It is useful to express this equation in terms of a variable a = √n.

Taking into account the equation of state p = p(n) and deﬁning a new
function ˜V (x) = V (Ay(x), Az(x)), we get

The strategy to derive the solutions is now clear. Choosing a pseudo-potential
V (Ay, Az) and then solving the Hamiltonian system (9-10) for the vector
potential, we determine simultaneously the magnetic ﬁeld and ˜V . Quantum
eﬀects manifests in the equation for the density, eq. (12), which also deserves
the function of state p = p(n).

Another legitimate interpretation of the balance equation (12) is to ﬁrst
specify the particle density n and the magnetic pressure
V /µ0 and then
solving for the kinetic pressure. This would give an equation of state with a
quantum correction. However, in most applications, one supposes a certain
equation of state and then proceeds to the calculation of the density and
velocity ﬁelds. This will be our preferred approach in what follows. In the
next section, we consider in detail the case of Harris sheet magnetic ﬁelds.

3 Quantum Harris sheet

Exactly as for the classical Harris solution, suppose a isothermal plasma,
p = nκBT , and a pseudo-potential function

V =

exp(

B2

B∞L

) ,

where L is a characteristic length and B∞ is a (constant) magnetic ﬁeld
reference value. The Hamiltonian system (9-10) is then

If we further take the boundary conditions Az(x = 0) = (dAz/dx)(x = 0) =
0, we easily solve (16) to get

Ay = Ay0 + B0x , Az =

B∞L ln cosh(x/L) ,

(17)

−

where Ay0 and B0 are integration constants. The magnetic ﬁeld following
from this vector potential characterizes the well-known Harris sheet solution,

By = B∞ tanh(x/L) , Bz = B0 ,

(18)

also allowing for a superimposed homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld.

In addition, the velocity ﬁeld follows from (4-5),

uy = 0 ,

uz =

B∞
eµ0nL

sech2(

x
L

) .

Notice that any departure from the classical density solution would imply
further changes in the velocity ﬁeld.

To derive the density we have to solve the third-order ODE eq. (12),
constructed in terms of the functions f (a) and g(x) at (13-14). Using the
isothermal equation of state, the form (15) for the pseudo-potential V and
the Harris sheet solution, we get

H =

(25)

where Va = B∞/(µ0mn0)1/2 is the Alfv´en velocity.

The parameter H is a measure of the relevance of the quantum eﬀects.
It is essentially the ratio of the scaled Planck constant ¯h to the action of
a particle of mass m travelling with the Alfv´en velocity and conﬁned in a
length L related to the thickness of the sheet. The larger the ambient density
n0 and the smaller the characteristic length L or the characteristic magnetic
ﬁeld B∞, the larger are the quantum eﬀects.

In order to understand the rˆole of the quantum terms, we may investigate

In the ultra-quantum limit H
, the left-hand side of (27) vanishes. In
this situation and using the prescribed boundary conditions, the solution is

α = cos X .

This imply a qualitative change (from localized to oscillatory) on the solution
due to quantum eﬀects. In order to further investigate this tendency, we show
the numerical solution for (27) with the appropriate boundary conditions for
a few values of H. This is shown in the ﬁgs. 1 and 2, where increasingly
oscillatory solutions are shown, according to H = 1 or H = 5 respectively.
On the opposite case, (27) shows that when H
0 we regain the classical
Harris solution, α = sechX.

4 Summary

Equation (12) describes a whole class of quantum equilibria for magnetoplas-
mas. The particle density compatible with a tanh magnetic ﬁeld shows an
increasingly oscillatory pattern, in comparison to the classical system associ-
ated to a localized sech2 solution. Other classes of equilibria can be built for
diﬀerent choices of pseudo-potentials V = V (Ay, Az) and equations of state
p = p(n). The ideas in the present formulation may be a starting point for
magnetic equilibria relevant for dense astrophysical objects like white dwarfs.

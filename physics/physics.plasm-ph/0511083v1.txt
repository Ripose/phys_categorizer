Abstract

The equations governing the interaction between incoherent light and electron-acoustic waves

are presented. The modulational instability properties of the system are studied, and the eﬀect

of partially coherent light is discussed. It is shown that partial coherence of the light suppresses

the modulational instability. However, short wavelength perturbations are less aﬀected, and will

therefore dominate in, e.g. pulse ﬁlamentation. The results may be of importance to space plasmas

and laser-plasma systems.

The investigation of the interaction between light and ion-acoustic waves was pioneered by

Karpman in the early seventies [1, 2]. Since then there have been numerous studies devoted

to the corresponding governing equations, which are known as the Karpman equations. For

example, the latter admit shock-like solutions as well as envelope light solitons [1, 2, 3].

Recently, motivated by observational and experimental studies [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], the governing

equations for light interacting with electron-acoustic waves (EAWs) were derived [9], using

a two-species electron ﬂuid model. Since ions are assumed immobile in Shukla et al.

[9],

the phenomena of light-EAW interactions takes place on a timescale shorter than the ion

plasma period.

In this Brief Communication, we will develop a formalism suited for treating eﬀects of

partial coherence of the light source. The modulational instability properties of the resulting

system of equations are analyzed, and the coherent and incoherent cases are contrasted. It

is shown that partial coherence lead to damping of the modulational instability. However,

in the limit of short wavelengths, the eﬀect of a ﬁnite spectral width is suppressed, and

such short wavelength modes are therefore more likely to yield, e.g. pulse ﬁlamentation.

The results can be of importance in space plasmas and laser-plasma systems involving short

laser pulses.

In Ref. [9], the equations governing the nonlinear interaction between coherent light waves

and electron-acoustic waves were obtained. We consider the propagation of electromagnetic

waves in a two population electron plasma, where one of the electron species is hot, while

the other electron species is cold. The electromagnetic wave is given by the vector potential

A(t, z) = ψ(t, z) exp(ik0z − iω0t). The evolution of the slowly varying light wave envelope

ψ(t, z) is given by the equation

where vg = k0c2/ω0 is the group velocity of the light wave, Nh = nh/nh0, Nc = nc/nc0,

δ = nc0/nh0, nc (nh) is the cold (hot) electron number density perturbation, nc0 (nh0) is
the cold (hot) electron background number density, and ωph = (4πnh0e2/me)1/2 is the hot

electron plasma frequency. Moreover, the hot electron density distribution is given by the

Boltzmann distribution, i.e.

where Ce = VT hδ1/2. Thus, Eqs. (1), (4) and (5) form the desired system of equations for

coherent interaction between light and EAWs. In Ref. [9] it has been shown that (1), (4),

and (5) admits localization and collapse of light pulses.

In order to account for the eﬀects of partial coherence in the light source, we employ the

Wigner formalism. Starting from the two-point correlation function of the ﬁeld of interest

(in our case the light ﬁeld), one performs a Fourier transform of this correlation function and

obtains a generalized distribution function [10]. Thus, we let the generalized distribution

function for the light quanta be [10]

for the light pseudo-particles. Here the arrows denotes the direction of operation, and the

sin-operator is deﬁned in terms of its Taylor expansion. By assuming a light distribution

function with a ﬁnite spectral width, i.e. a ﬁnite spread in the light power spectrum, the

eﬀect of partial coherence can be incorporated into the light propagation through the two-

electron plasma. Thus, Eqs. (5), (7), and (8) describes the interaction between partially

coherent light and EAWs.

Next we analyze the stability properties of the system (5), (7), and (8) by perturbing

these equations around a stationary plasma state (see, e.g.

[11] for a similar treatment of

quantum plasmas). We let ρ(t, z, k) = ρ0(k) + ρ1(k) exp(iKz − iΩt), where |ρ1| ≪ |ρ0|, and

ϕ = ϕ1 exp(iKz − iΩt). Moreover, we have Ψ = Ψ0 + Ψ1 exp(iKz − iΩz), where |Ψ1| ≪ |Ψ0|.

Linearizing the system (5), (7), and (8) with respect to the ﬁrst order quantities, we obtain

Comparing the dispersion relations (11) and (14), it can be seen that the spectral broadening

will reduce the growth rate.

From now on we put the wavenumber shift κ0 to zero, thus centering the Lorentzian

distribution (12) around 0, as well as transforming to a comoving system, such that vg → 0.

Using these dimensionless variables, we have plotted the typical behavior of the growth rate

Γ = i(Re Ω−Ω), as given by the dispersion relations (11) and (14), in Fig. 1. The uppermost

curve corresponds to ∆ = 0, i.e. the dispersion relation as given by (10). The growth rate

asymptotically tends to 1 for the parameter values chosen in Fig. 1, and characteristically

approaches an constant value for large wavenumbers if other parameter values are chosen.

Moreover, the three lower curves has successively higher values of the spectral width ∆. The

damping character of a nonzero spectral width can clearly be seen. Furthermore, it is clear

that for long wavelengths, i.e. small values of K, the damping may completely suppress the

growth rate, although small values may even enhance the growth rate (cf. the solid and

dashed curved for small K). However, for short wavelength modes, i.e. higher values of K,

even the cases with nonzero ∆ asymptotically tends to the same value of the growth rate

as in the monochromatic case. Thus, short wavelength modes seem almost unaﬀected by

the spectral broadening, and such short wavelength perturbations would therefore dominate

in the contribution to the ﬁlamentation, as well as in soliton and shock wave formation [9]

of the incoherent light interacting with EAWs. In principle, these observations could be of

importance in situations where the two-species electron model plays an important role, such

as in space plasmas and laser-plasma systems [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

To summarize, we have derived the governing equations for the interaction between light

(coherent and incoherent) and EAWs. The limit of mono-chromatic light was analyzed, and

compared to the case where spectral broadening was taken into account. It was shown that

5

the eﬀect of a ﬁnite width in the power spectrum of the light in general was to suppress

the modulational instability. However, for short wavelength modes the spectral broadening

was shown only to have a small inﬂuence on the modulational instability growth rate, thus

making these modes more likely to dominate in the ﬁlamentation of pulses and the formation

of shocks and solitons in space and laser plasmas.

κ0 = 0. Here we have used the normalized variables (15). Moreover, we have used the values

normalized values Ce = 0.5, λDh = 0.5, Ψ0 = 0.5. The solid black curve has ∆ = 0, the dashed

eﬀect of a ﬁnite spectral width can clearly be seen, although the short wavelength modes are less

aﬀected. The asymptotic value of the growth rate in this case is 1.

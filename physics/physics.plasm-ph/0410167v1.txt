Abstract. Three kinds of electrostatic modes are experimentally observed to
propagate along magnetic-ﬁeld lines for the ﬁrst time in the pair-ion plasma consisting
of only positive and negative fullerene ions with an equal mass. It is found that phase
lags between the density ﬂuctuations of positive and negative ions vary from 0 to π
depending on the frequency and is ﬁxed at π in the cases of ion acoustic and ion plasma
waves, respectively. In addition, a new mode with the phase lag about π appears in
an intermediate-frequency band between the acoustic and plasma waves.

1. Introduction

Plasmas comprising assemblies of charged particles, which interact with each other
through the Coulomb force, are known to reveal various kinds of unique properties. A
typical plasma consists of electrons and positive ions, and the mass diﬀerence between
negative- and positive-charged particles essentially causes temporal and spatial varieties
of collective plasma phenomena. As one of the phenomena,
linear and nonlinear
properties of electrostatic and electromagnetic waves have been investigated in plasmas
so far. Pair plasmas consisting of only positive- and negative-charged particles with
an equal mass have been investigated experimentally [1–7] and theoretically [8–14],
since the pair plasmas, such as electron-positron plasma, are thought to be generated
naturally under certain astrophysical conditions. Both the relativistic and non-
relativistic pair-plasmas are gradually disclosed to represent a new state of matter
with unique thermodynamic property drastically diﬀerent from ordinary electron-ion
plasmas. A comprehensive analysis of the elementary properties of the pair plasmas,
linear- and nonlinear-collective plasma modes, has theoretically been developed and
the experimental identiﬁcation is at present desired to be performed. However,the
identiﬁcation of the collective modes is very diﬃcult in the electron-positron plasmas
because the annihilation time is short compared with the plasma period. Therefore
our attention is concentrated on the stable generation of a pair-ion plasma consisting
of positive and negative ions with an equal mass and the resultant collective-mode
identiﬁcation.

According to our previous work on the generation of an alkali-fullerene plasma
(K+, e−, C−
60) by introducing fullerenes into a potassium plasma [15–18], fullerenes are
adopted as a candidate for the ion source in order to realize the pair-ion plasma, based
on the fact that the interaction of electrons with the fullerenes leads to the production
of both negative [19, 20] and positive [21–23] ions. We have developed a novel method
for generating the pair-ion plasma which consists of only positive and negative ions with
an equal mass using fullerenes [24], and discussed basic characteristics of the pair-ion
plasma in terms of the diﬀerences from ordinary electron-ion plasmas. Here the pair-ion
plasma source is drastically improved in order to increase the plasma density and excite
eﬀectively the collective modes. We mainly present properties of the electrostatic modes
propagating along magnetic-ﬁeld lines.

2. Pair-Ion Plasma Generation

The improved pair-ion source with ion species of fullerenes is installed in a grounded
vacuum-chamber of 15.7 cm in diameter and 260 cm in length, as shown schematically
in Fig. 1 [24]. A uniform magnetic ﬁeld of B = 0.3 T is applied by solenoid coils and the
10−4 Pa. A grounded copper cylinder (8 cm in diameter
background gas pressure is 2
and 30 cm in length) with a copper annulus (3 cm in inner diameter, 8 cm in outer
diameter, and 0.1 cm in thickness) is ﬁxed inside a cylindrical ceramic furnace and

heated to 500 ◦C. An electron-beam gun is set inside the copper cylinder, which consists
of four tungsten wires connected electrically in parallel. This wire cathode heated over
2000 ◦C by resistive heating is biased at a voltage Vk (< 0 V) with respect to a grounded
grid set at less than 0.5 cm in front of the cathode. A stainless-steel disk of 4 cm in
diameter is concentrically welded onto the gridded anode. Thermionically emitted low-
0.2 eV) are accelerated by an electric ﬁeld between the cathode and
energy electrons (
anode, forming a hollow electron beam. The beam ﬂows along magnetic (B) ﬁeld lines
and is terminated at the grounded annulus. The beam energy Ee can be controlled in
150 eV by changing Vk. The cylinder and the ceramic furnace have a
the range of 0
hole (3 cm in diameter) on the sidewall and an oven for fullerene sublimation is set
there, where a fullerene sample (C60 powder) is heated at a temperature between 400
and 600 ◦C. The fullerene vapor produced as a result of sublimation is eﬀused through
a 0.3-cm-diam hole under molecular ﬂow conditions, ﬁlling the cylinder.

60 and electron ρC+

For analytic convenience, the whole space of this plasma is divided into three regions
(I), (II), and (III), as shown in Fig. 1. The electron-beam region is called Region (I)
as a fullerene-ion production region. Positive ions C+
60 are produced by the electron-
impact ionization and low-energy electrons are simultaneously produced in connection
with this process. Negative ions C−
60 are produced by the attachment of these low-
energy electrons. The attachment occurs over a very wide energy range, extending to
about 12 eV, and which is deserving special mention. The gyroradius ratio between
C+
/ρe− is especially high (
1100), and a preferential ambipolar-
diﬀusion of C+
60 can take place in the radial (r) direction across the B-ﬁeld
lines, i.e., electrons are separated by a magnetic-ﬁltering eﬀect [25]. Only C+
60 and C−
60
are expected to exist in the midmost of the cylinder, Region (II), and the electron-free
pair-ion plasma generation is attained here. C+
60 ﬂow along the B-ﬁeld lines and
pass through the annular hole toward an experimental region, Region (III). The thick
copper annulus (3 cm in inner diameter, 8 cm in outer diameter, and 3 cm in thickness)
is set between Region (II) and (III), and independently biased at a dc voltage Van and
an ac voltage Vexc. The plasma density in Region (III) can be controlled by changing
Van and Vexc. The exit position of the thick annulus is deﬁned as z = 0 cm, and the
pair-ion plasma is terminated at a ﬂoating endplate (z = 90 cm). Plasma parameters in
Region (III) are measured by Langmuir probes, collectors of which are prevented from
being contaminated by C60.

The generation property of the pair-ion plasma depending on the electron-beam
energy Ee is measured at r = 0 cm and z = 5 cm in Region (III) for Van = Vexc = 0 V,
as shown in Fig. 2. I+ and I− are the Langmuir-probe saturation currents of C+
60 and
C−
60, respectively, which are considered to be in proportion to the plasma density. When
Ee increases from 0 eV, the pair-ion plasma begins to be generated. The plasma density
once saturates, a little bit decreases around 9 eV, increases around 15 eV again, and
108 cm−3 at Ee = 100 eV. The temperatures of C+
60, T+ and
ﬁnally attains to 1
T−, are about 0.5 eV. The plasma and ﬂoating potentials are almost 0 V which is equal
to the potential of the grid and the thin annulus. Therefore it can be said that the static

potential-structures including sheaths are not formed in the pair-ion plasma because the
ions have the same mass and temperature. This property of the plasma generation in
the energy range of Ee < 30 eV is quite diﬀerent from the previous result for the case of
the LaB6 cathode [24]. The plasma density in Ee < 30 eV does not clearly depend on the
magnetic ﬁeld B, but strongly depends in Ee > 30 eV. The direct contact of the fullerene
vapor with the thermal cathode is supposed to be involved in the ionization process of
fullerene, although the exact physical mechanism in Ee < 30 eV is not understood. Since
the density in Region (III) drastically decreases for
= 0 V, the density modulation
can be realized without using a grid immersed inside the plasma cross section, which
disturbs the plasma condition. Thus, longitudinal-electrostatic modes are excited in
the pair-ion plasma, when the voltage of the annular exciter is temporally alternated
(Vexc

= 0).

3. Electrostatic Waves in Pair-Ion Plasma

Some theoretical works have already been presented, which concern linear and
nonlinear collective modes in non-relativistic electron-positron plasmas [8–13]. A
comprehensive two-ﬂuid model has been developed for collective-mode analyses, based
on which longitudinal (transverse) electrostatic (electromagnetic) modes have been
studied. The longitudinal collective modes are analogous to those in the ordinary
electron-ion plasmas. On the other hand, the transverse collective modes in the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld are quite diﬀerent from those in the ordinary plasmas, for instance,
the whistler mode does not exist. Here, electrostatic modes are focused in our pair-ion
plasma, because the density and the temperature are relatively low and the induction
current of the ions is very small, and electromagnetic modes relevant to the plasma can
be neglected.

The twoﬂuid equations in the absence of an applied B ﬁeld appropriate to the pair-
ion plasma consist of the usual momentum and continuity equations for each species,
supplemented by Poisson’s equation.

The property of the wave propagation along the B-ﬁeld lines is measured at r
= 0 cm and z = 10
12 cm in Region (III) for Ee = 100 eV by exciting the density
ﬂuctuation with the annular exciter, as mentioned above. The measured (dots) and
the calculated (solid curves) dispersion relations are shown in Fig. 3, where the density
modulation condition is Van = 0 V and Vexc = 0.2 V, and the resultant amplitude of
the density ﬂuctuation n1/n0 is about 0.1. The wave number (wave length) is obtained
from the phase delay of the positive-ion density ﬂuctuation measured at z = 10, 11,
and 12 cm. The theoretical curves are calculated using Eqs. (6) and (7) for γ = 3
107 cm−3. Typical
(one-dimensional compression), T = 0.5 eV (isotropy), and n0 = 1
plasma parameters are as follows: the pair-plasma frequency is (√2ωp)/2π = 35 kHz,
the cyclotron frequency (B = 0.3 T) is ωc/2π = 6.4 kHz, and the acoustic speed is cs =
104 cm/s. There are three branches in the measured dispersion relation, ω/2π < 8
4.5
kHz (the ion acoustic wave, IAW), 8 < ω/2π < 32 kHz, and ω/2π > 32 kHz (the ion
plasma wave, IPW). IPW measured ﬁts to the calculated curve, and IAW measured in
the relatively low-frequency band (ω/2π < 3 kHz) also ﬁts but deviates from it in the
relatively high-frequency band (3 < ω/2π < 8 kHz). It is worth while pointing out that
a new mode is experimentally observed in 8 < ω/2π < 32 kHz for the ﬁrst time, but we
have not succeeded in deriving theoretically the dispersion relation of the new mode yet.
The new mode has the feature that the group velocity is negative but the phase velocity
is positive, i.e., the mode is like a backward wave, and called the intermediate-frequency
wave (IFW) here.

The typical temporal variations of the positive- and negative-ion densities and the

oscillating components of the positive and negative saturation currents (relative to the
positive- and negative-ion densities), and the ﬂoating potential of the probe (the space
potential) measured at z = 10 cm, respectively. The frequency spectrum of the phase
θ( ˜I+) between ˜I+ and ˜I− is measured at r = 0 cm and z = 10 cm as shown
lag θ( ˜I−)
in Fig. 5.
In Fig. 4 (a), the phase lag of the densities for IAW is close to zero and
the amplitude of the potential oscillation is extremely small, which is consistent with
the result derived from the theoretical dispersion relation (6). Although the property
of IAW measured in the very low-frequency range (ω/2π < 1 kHz) is the same as the
theoretical one, the phase lag starts to increase in proportion to ω/2π (1 < ω/2π < 3
kHz) and attains to a constant value of about 1.1π (3 < ω/2π < 8 kHz), which has
not been explained theoretically yet. On the other hand the phase lags for IPW and
IFW are π and 1.03π independently of ω/2π, respectively, and their potential-oscillation
amplitudes are large, as seen in Figs. 4 (c) and (d).

The modes propagating oblique B-ﬁeld lines are observed in vicinity of the annular
exciter. The measured (dots) and the calculated (solid curves) dispersion relations are
4 cm for Ee =
shown in Fig. 6, where the mode is measured at r = 0 cm and z = 2
100 eV, Van = 0 V, and Vexc = 0.2 V. Here, the wave number k|| denotes the parallel
component of k and the propagation angle is 0.48π with respect to B-ﬁeld lines. The
theoretical curves are calculated from Eqs. (8) and (9) for α = 0.48π and the plasma
parameters are same as the case of propagating along B-ﬁeld lines. There are four
branches and the ion cyclotron resonance appears in the measured dispersion relation.
A backward-wave like mode exists around the ion cyclotron frequency ωc/2π (= 6.4 kHz)
but not in the frequency range of between the ion acoustic wave and the ion plasma
wave. The phase lag of the modes propagating oblique B-ﬁeld lines will be measured in
our future works.

Some theoretical ideas for providing an explanation of the modes are recently
proposed, and we introduce them here. Dr. A. Hasegawa and Dr. P. K. Shukla suggest
that the modes could be surface waves and they derive the dispersion relations of them
in a planer model and a cylindrical model. Dr. H. Schamel suggests the interpretation
of the wave characteristics in term of periodic hole equilibria and associated kinetic
modes, where the mode coupling between the ion plasma wave and the ion acoustic
wave is caused by the particles trapped in the wave potential and IFW could appear.
Dr. F. Verheest suggests the oblique propagation of large amplitude electromagnetic
solitons in pair plasmas. Dr. J. Vranjes suggests that only two modes, the electrostatic
Langmuir mode and the electromagnetic transverse plasma mode, could exist in the
pair-ion plasma in the absence of B ﬁeld. We will make it appear experimentally that
these theoretical suggestions are well suited to this pair-ion plasma or not.

4. Summary

60 and C−

In summary, for the purpose of experimentally investigating electrostatic wave
phenomena in a pair-ion plasma, the drastic improvement of the pair-ion plasma source
consisting of only C+
60 with an equal mass is performed eﬀectively using a
magnetized hollow electron beam, and processes of electron-impact ionization, electron
attachment, and magnetically-ﬁltered separation. The active excitation of density
modulation by a thick annulus reveals the existence of three kinds of electrostatic modes
propagating along B-ﬁeld lines, an ion acoustic wave (IAW), an ion plasma wave (IPW),
and an intermediate-frequency wave(IFW). IAW and IPW are predicted in the twoﬂuid
theory for a unbounded plasma, while IFW is not predicted but only experimentally
observed here. The phase lags between the density ﬂuctuations of positive and negative
ions are 0 for IAW in the low-frequency range, about π for IFW, and π for IPW.

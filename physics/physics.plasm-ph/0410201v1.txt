Abstract. The propagation of intense laser pulses and the generation of high energy
electrons from the underdense plasmas are investigated using two dimensional particle-
in-cell simulations. When the ratio of the laser power and a critical power of relativistic
self-focusing is the optimal value, it propagates stably and electrons have maximum
energies.

1. Introduction

The interaction of an intense ultrashort laser pulse with underdense plasmas has
attracted much interest for a compact accelerator. Using intense laser systems, of which
peak powers exceed 10 TW, electrons with energies greater than 100 MeV have been
observed in various low density range, of which electron densities are from 6×1016cm−3 to
2.5 × 1019cm−3 [1,2]. On the other hand, using terawatt class Ti:sapphire laser systems,
electrons with energies greater than several mega-electron-volts have been observed from
moderately underdense plasmas, of which densities are up to near the quarter-critical
density [3, 4]. At the moderately underdense plasmas, the electron energies exceed the
maximum energies determined by dephasing length. It is considered recently that the
acceleration occurs by the direct laser acceleration [5] that includes stochastic or chaotic
processes.

In this paper, we study the propagation of the laser pulses and the generation
of high energy electron in the underdense plasmas using two dimensional particle-
in-cell (2D PIC) simulations. The laser power PL beyond the critical power Pcr is
necessary because self-focusing is important in a long-distance propagation [6]. Here,
Pcr ≃ 17 (nc/ne) GW, ne and nc are the electron density and critical density, respectively.

2

We assume a terawatt class Ti:sapphire laser system as a compact laser system in the
simulations parameter, because the plasma electron densities ne = (1 ∼ 20) × 1019cm−3.

2. 2D PIC Simulation Results

We use the 2D PIC simulation with immobile ions. The peak irradiated intensity, pulse
2
length, and spot size are 5 × 1018 W/cm
, 50 fs, and 3.6 µm, respectively. PL = 2 TW,
namely the energy is 100 mJ, when cylindrical symmetry is assumed, although we use
two dimensional cartesian coordinates. The Rayleigh length LR = 50µm. The plasma
electron densities ne = (1 ∼ 20) × 1019cm−3, which correspond to ne/nc = 0.057 ∼ 0.11,
where nc = 1.7 × 1021cm−3 for the wavelength λ0 = 0.8µm. These parameters of the
simulations are almost the same as the experiments of compact laser system [4]. The
laser power PL = 2 TW exceeds the critical powers Pcr of the relativistic self-focusing
for ne > 1 × 1019cm−3.

Figures 1(a)-(e) show the intensities of laser pulses after propagating 2.5LR for
electron densities ne = 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 × 1019cm−3, respectively. For ne = 1 and
2 × 1019cm−3, namely, PL/Pcr ≃ 1, the pulses stably propagate without modulation.
Electrons with energies greater than 2 MeV are hardly observed. For ne = 5×1019cm−3,
the back of pulse is modulated. Electrons get energies greater than 20 MeV, as shown
later. For ne = 1 × 1020cm−3, a pulse separates into the bunches of which size about
the plasma wavelength. A pulse breaks up and is not propagate stably any longer, for
ne = 2 × 1020cm−3, i.e. PL/Pcr > 10.

The electron energy spectra for electron densities ne = 20, 10, and 5 × 1019cm−3
are shown in Figs. 2(a)-(c), respectively. The maximum energy is greater than 20 MeV
for ne = 5 × 1019cm−3. Before the pulses propagate about one and two Rayleigh length,
the maximum electron energies have been saturated at 20 MeV and 10 MeV for ne = 1
and 2 × 1020cm−3, respectively.

3. Concluding Remarks

We study the propagation of the intense laser pulses and the generation of high energy
electrons from the moderately underdense plasmas using 2D PIC simulations. For
PL/Pcr ≃ 3, the laser pulse of which power and pulse length are 2 TW and 50 fs
stably propagates with modulation. As a result, the high energy electrons with energies
greater than 20 MeV are observed and their energies have not been saturated, namely,
electrons can gain higher energies propagating with the intense laser pulse through long
size plasmas. For PL/Pcr 6 2, although the pulses stably propagate, no high energy
electron is observed. On the other hand, for PL/Pcr > 5, high energy electrons with
energies up to 20 MeV are observed, although pulses does not propagate stably.

The simulation results of the dependence to the plasma density of the maximum
electron energy explain the latest experiment well qualitatively [4]. In the simulations,
the maximum propagation distance is 3LR is limited by the performance of the computer

and simulation code. Since the pulse has propagated suﬃciently stably to 2.5LR for the
plasma densities less than 5 × 1019cm−3, simulations with a longer propagation distance
is required.

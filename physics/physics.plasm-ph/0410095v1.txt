Intrinsic Localized Modes (ILM) (or Discrete Breathers, DB) are localized oscillatory modes
known to occur in atomic or molecular chains characterized by coupling and/or on-site potential
nonlinearity. Quasi-crystals of charged mesoscopic dust grains (dust lattices), which have been
observed since hardly a decade ago, are an exciting paradigm of such a nonlinear chain. In gas-
discharge experiments, these crystals are subject to forces due to an externally imposed electric
and/or magnetic ﬁeld(s), which balance(s) gravity at the levitated equilibrium position, as well
as to electrostatic inter-grain interaction forces. Despite the profound role of nonlinearity, which
may be due to inter-grain coupling, mode-coupling and to the sheath environment, the elucidation
of the nonlinear mechanisms governing dust crystals is still in a preliminary stage. This study is
devoted to an investigation, from very ﬁrst principles, of the existence of discrete localized modes
in dust layers. Relying on a set of evolution equation for transverse charged grain displacements,
we examine the conditions for the existence and sustainance of discrete localized modes and discuss
the dependence of their characteristics on intrinsic plasma parameters. In addition, the possibility
of DB stabilisation via an external force is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

A variety of linear and nonlinear collective eﬀects are known to occur in a dust-contaminated plasma (dusty plasma,
DP) [1] and relative theoretical research has received new impulse, since roughly a decade ago, thanks to laboratory
and space dusty plasma observations. An issue of particular importance in DP research is the formation of strongly
coupled DP crystals by highly charged dust grains, typically in the sheath region above a horizontal negatively biased
electrode in experiments [1, 2]. Low-frequency oscillations are known to occur [2] in these mesoscopic dust grain
quasi-lattices in the longitudinal (∼ ˆx, in-plane, acoustic mode), horizontal transverse (∼ ˆy, in-plane, shear mode)
and vertical transverse (∼ ˆz, oﬀ-plane, optic-like mode) directions.

Various types of localized (nonlinear) excitations are known from solid state physics to exist in periodic chains
(lattices)of interacting particles, in addition to propagating vibrations (phonons), due to a mutual balance between
the intrinsic nonlinearity of the medium and dispersion. Such structures, usually investigated in a continuum approx-
imation (i.e. assuming that the typical spatial variation scale far exceeds the typical lattice scale, e.g. the lattice
constant r0), include non-topological solitons (pulses), kinks (i.e. shocks or dislocations) and localized modulated
envelope structures (envelope solitons), and generic nonlinear theories have been developed in order to investigate
their relevance in diﬀerent physical contexts [3]. In addition to these (continuum) theories, which deliberately sacriﬁce
discreteness in the altar of analytical tractability, attention has been paid since more than a decade ago to highly
localized (either stationary or propagating) vibrating structures [e.g. discrete breathers (DBs), also widely referred
to as intrinsic localized modes (ILMs)], which owe their very existence to the lattice discreteness itself. Thanks to a
few pioneering works [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and a number of studies which followed, many aspects involved in the spontaneous

formation, mobility and interaction of DBs are now elucidated, both theoretically and experimentally; see in Refs.
[9, 10, 11] for a review (also see Refs. [12, 13], with reference to this study).

Despite the fact that nonlinearity is an inherent feature of the dust crystal dynamics (either due to inter-grain
electrostatic interactions, to the sheath environment, which is intrinsically anharmonic, or to coupling between diﬀerent
degrees of freedom), our knowledge of nonlinear mechanisms related to dust lattice modes still appears to be in a
rather preliminary stage today. Small amplitude localized longitudinal excitations (described by a Boussinesq equation
for the longitudinal grain displacement u, or a Korteweg-deVries equation for the density ∂u/∂x) were considered in
Refs. [14] and generalized in Ref. [15]. The nonlinear amplitude modulation of longitudinal and transverse (vertical,
oﬀ-plane) dust lattice waves was recently considered in Refs.
[16, 17] and [18, 19] (also see [20]), respectively. In
fact, all of these studies rely on a continuum description of the dust lattice. On the other hand, the eﬀect of the
high discreteness of dust crystals, clearly suggested by experiments [21, 22, 23, 24], may play an important role in
mechanisms like energy localization, storage and propagation and thus modify the crystal’s dynamical response to
external excitations (in view of DP application design, e.g.). To the very best of our knowledge, no study has been
carried out, from ﬁrst principles, of the relevance of DB excitations with respect to dust lattice waves, apart from
a preliminary investigation (restricted to single-mode transverse dust-breathers), which was recently presented [25].
This text aims in making a ﬁrst analytical step towards ﬁlling this gap, by raising a number of questions which have
not been addressed before. This study is neither exhaustive nor complete; it will be complemented by forthcoming
work.

II. THE MODEL

We shall consider the vertical (oﬀ-plane, ∼ ˆz) grain displacement in a dust crystal (assumed quasi-one-dimensional:
identical grains of charge q and mass M are situated at xn = n r0, where n = ..., −1, 0, 1, 2, ...), by taking into account
the intrinsic nonlinearity of the sheath electric (and/or magnetic) potential. The in-plane (longitudinal, acoustic,
∼ ˆx and shear, optical, ∼ ˆy) degrees of freedom are assumed suppressed; this situation is indeed today realized in
appropriate experiments, where an electric potential (via a thin wire) [21] or a coherent light (laser) impulse [22, 23, 24]
is used to trigger transverse dust grain oscillations, while (a) conﬁnement potential(s) ensure(s) the chain’s in-plane
stability.

The vertical grain displacement obeys an equation in the form [18, 19]

A. Equation of motion

0 ( δzn+1 + δzn−1 − 2 δzn) + ω2

(1)

where δzn(t) = zn(t)−z0 denotes the small displacement of the n−th grain around the (levitated) equilibrium position
z0, in the transverse (z−) direction. The characteristic frequency ω0 =
results from the dust
for a Debye-H¨uckel potential [26]: ΦD(r) = (q/r) e−r/λD , one
grain (electrostatic) interaction potential Φ(r), e.g.
has: ω2
0) (1 + r0/λD) exp(−r0/λD) , where λD denotes the eﬀective DP Debye radius [1]. The damping
coeﬃcient ν accounts for dissipation due to collisions between dust grains and neutral atoms. The gap frequency ωg
and the nonlinearity coeﬃcients α, β are deﬁned via the overall vertical force:

(cid:2)

F (z) = Fe/m − M g ≈ −M [ω2

gδzn + α (δzn)2 + β (δzn)3] + O[(δzn)4] ,

(2)

which has been expanded around z0 by formally taking into account the (anharmonicity of the) local form of the
sheath electric (follow exactly the deﬁnitions in Ref. [18], not reproduced here) and/or magnetic [27] ﬁeld(s), as well
as, possibly, grain charge variation due to charging processes [19]. Recall that the electric/magnetic levitating force(s)
Fe/m balance(s) gravity at z0. Notice the diﬀerence in structure from the usual nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation used
to describe one-dimensional oscillator chains — cf. e.g. Eq. (1) in Ref.
[6]: TDLWs (‘phonons’ ) in this chain are
stable only in the presence of the ﬁeld force Fe/m.

For convenience, we may re-scale the time and vertical displacement variables over appropriate quantities, i.e.
g τ and

and the lattice constant r0, respectively, viz. t = ω−1

the characteristic (single grain) oscillation period ω−1
δzn = r0qn; Eq. (1) is thus expressed as:

n = 0 ,

where the (dimensionless) damping term, now expressed as (ν/ωg)dqn/dτ ≡ ν′ ˙qn, will be henceforth omitted in the
left-hand side. The coupling parameter ǫ = ω2
g measures the strength of the inter-grain interactions (with respect
to the single-grain vertical vibrations); this is typically a small parameter, in real experiments (see below). The
nonlinearity coeﬃcients are now: α′ = αr0/ω2

g and β′ = βr2

Eq. (3) will be the basis of the analysis that will follow. Note that the primes in α′ and β′ will henceforth be

In order to relate our physical problem to existing generic models from solid state physics, it is appropriate to

consider the equation of motion (1) as it may be derived from a Hamiltonian function, which here reads:

Here, pj obviously denotes the (classical) momentum pj = M ˙qj. The substrate potential, related to the sheath plasma
environment, is of the form:

The coupling parameter ǫ takes small numerical values (cf. below), accounting for the high lattice discreteness
anticipated in this study. The minus sign preceding it denotes the inverse dispersive character of (linear excitations
propagating in) the system; see the discussion below. Upon setting ǫ → −ǫ, the ‘traditional’ (discretized) nonlinear
Klein-Gordon model is recovered [28].

It should be noted that both experimental [21] and ab initio (numerical) [29] studies suggest that dust crystals
are embedded in an nonlinear on-site (sheath) potential V , in the vertical direction, which is (possibly strongly)
asymmetric around the origin, i.e. not an even function of qj. This implies a ﬁnite value of the cubic anharmonicity
parameter α, thus invalidating models involving even potential forms – e.g. V (qj) ∼ q2

j /4 – in our case.

Retaining only the linear contribution and considering oscillations of the type, δzn ∼ exp[i (knr0 − ωt)] + c.c.
(complex conjuguate) in Eq. (1), one obtains the well known transverse dust lattice (TDL) wave optical-mode-like
dispersion relation

i.e.

See that the wave frequency ω ≡ ˜ωωg decreases with increasing wavenumber k = 2π/λ ≡ ˜k/r0 (or decreasing
wavelength λ), implying that transverse vibrations propagate as a backward wave: the group velocity vg = ω′(k) and
the phase velocity ωph = ω/k have opposite directions (this behaviour has been observed in recent experiments). The
modulational stability proﬁle of these linear waves (depending on the plasma parameters) was investigated in Refs.
[18, 19]. Notice the natural gap frequency ω(k = 0) = ωg = ωmax, corresponding to an overall motion of the chain’s
0)1/2 ≡ ωg (1 − 4ǫ2)1/2 (obtained at the end of the ﬁrst
center of mass, as well as the cutoﬀ frequency ωmin = (ω2
Brillouin zone k = π/r0) which is absent in the continuum limit, viz. ω2 ≈ ω2
0 ); obviously, the
study of wave propagation in this (k <
∼ π/r0) region invalidates the continuum treatment employed so far in literature.
The essential feature of discrete dynamics, to be retained here, is the (narrow) bounded TDLW (‘phonon’ ) frequency
0)1/2, ωg]; note that one thus naturally obtains the stability constraint:

IV. EXISTENCE OF DISCRETE BREATHERS - ANALYSIS

We are interested in the (possibility for the) existence of multi-mode breathers, i.e. localized (discrete) excitations

in the form:

qn(τ ) =

An(m) exp(imωτ ) ,

(8)

with An(m) = A∗

n(−m) for reality and |An(m)| → 0 as n → ±∞, for localization.

A. The formalism

Inserting Eq. (8) in the equation of motion (3), one obtains a (numerable) set of algebraic equations in the form:

An+1(m) + An−1(m) + CmAn(m) = −

An(m1)An(m2)An(m3)

where the dummy indices mj (j = 1, 2, ..., 5) satisfy m1 + m2 + m3 = m4 + m5 = m; we have deﬁned:

In order to be more precise and gain in analytical tractability (yet somewhat losing in generality), one may assume

that the contribution of higher (for m ≥ 2) frequency harmonics may be neglected. Eq. (8) then reduces to:

Cm = −

Note the zeroth-harmonic (mean displacement) term, for n = 0, which is due to the cubic term (∼ α, above), and
should vanish for α = 0. The system (9) thus becomes (for m = 0, 1):

An+1(1) + An−1(1) + C1An(1) = −2

(12)

i.e., setting An(1) = An(−1) = An and An(0) = Bn, viz. qn(t) = 2An cos ωτ + Bn:

An+1 + An−1 + C1An = −2

We see that the amplitudes An (Bn) of the ﬁrst (zeroth) harmonic terms, corresponding to the n−th site, will be
given by the iterative solution of Eqs. (13) [or, of Eqs. (9), should higher harmonics m be considered]. In speciﬁc,
one may express (13) as:

an+1 = −cn − C1an + 2

dn+1 = bn ,

and then iterate, for a given initial condition (a1, b1, c1, d1) = (A1, B1, A0, B0), the map deﬁned by (14).

At this stage, one needs to determine whether the ﬁxed point of the 4-dimensional map (14) [or of the complete
4N-dimensional map corresponding to (9), in general] is hyperbolic, and examine the dimensionality of its stable and
unstable manifolds. It is known [12, 13] that the existence of discrete breathers is associated with homoclinic orbits,
implying a saddle point at the origin.

Let us now linearize the map (14) near the ﬁxed point (a1, b1, c1, d1) = (0, 0, 0, 0) ≡ 04, by setting e.g.

(an, bn, cn, dn) = (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4)T

n ≡ Ξn ∈ ℜ4, where ξj,n ≪ 1 (j = 1, ..., 4). One thus obtains the matrix relation:

Now, it is a trivial algebraic exercise to show that the characteristic polynomial p(λ) ≡ Det(M − λI) of this matrix
may be factorized as:

p(λ) = (λ2 + C0λ + 1) (λ2 + C1λ + 1) ≡ p0(λ)p1(λ) ,

implying the existence of 4 eigenvalues, say λ1,2,3,4, such that p0(λ1,2) = p0(λ3,4) = 0. One may check that the
condition for all eigenvalues to be real and diﬀerent, hence for 04 to be a saddle point, amounts to the constraint:
|C0,1| > 2, i.e. C0 /∈ [−2, 2] and C1 /∈ [−2, 2]. Recalling that

C1 = (1 − 2ǫ − ω2)/ǫ ,

C0 = (1 − 2ǫ)/ǫ,

(17)

from (10), one ﬁnds the (simultaneous) constraints: 1 − 4ǫ > 0 and (1 − ω2)(1 − ω2 − 4ǫ) > 0. One immediately sees
that the former (i.e. ǫ < 1/4) corresponds to the linear stability condition mentioned above, while the latter amounts
to the requirement that the breather frequency should lie outside the ‘phonon band’, viz. ω2/ω2

g /∈ [1 − 4ǫ, 1].

—
It is straightforward to show that in case one considers the complete multi-mode map, deﬁned by Eq. (9), one
m pm(λ). The

obtains an analogous factorizable characteristic polynomial for the 4N × 4N matrix M, viz. p(λ) =
same analysis then leads to the hyperbolicity criterion:

Q

|Cm| < 2

m = 0, 1, 2, ...

One thus recovers, in addition to the ﬁrst of the above constraint (ǫ < 1/4), the condition: mω/ωg /∈ (1 − 4ǫ, 1)1/2
(∀m = 0, 1, 2, ...), which coincides with the – physically meaningful – non-breather-phonon-resonance condition found
via diﬀerent analytical methods [8, 9, 10]. We see that the breather frequency, as well as all its multiples (harmonics)
should lie outside the allowed linear vibration frequency band, otherwise the breather may enter in resonance with the
linear TDLW (‘phonon’ ) dispersion curve, resulting in its being decomposed into a superposition of linear excitations
(and hence de-localized).

At this stage, one is left with task of ﬁnding the numerical values of An, Bn [cf.

(13)] for a given homoclinic
orbit; these may then be used as an initial condition, in order to solve the equation (13) numerically, by considering

a given number of particles N and harmonic modes mmax (viz. m = 0, 1, 2, ..., mmax). One thus obtains a given
set of numerical values for un (n = 1, 2, ..., N ), which constitute the numerical solution for the anticipated breather
excitation. The stability of the solution thus obtained, say ˆqn, my be checked by directly substituting with qn = ˆqn +ξn
(for n = −N, ..., 0, ..., N ) into the initial equation of motion (3).

This numerical scheme is now being elaborated, and the detailed results will be reported in an extended paper, in

preparation.

V. BREATHER CONTROL.

The stability of a breather excitation may be controlled via external feedback, as known from one-dimensional
discrete solid chains [33]. The method consists in using the knowledge of a reference state (unstable breather), say
δz(0)
n = ˆzn(t), e.g. obtained via an investigation of the homoclinic orbits of the 2d map obeyed by the main Fourier
component [9], and then perturbing the evolution equation (1) by adding a term +K[ˆzn(t) − δzn] in the right-hand
side (rhs), in order to stabilize breathers via tuning of the control parameter K. This method relies on the application
in [13]). Alternatively, as argued in [13], a more
of the continuous feedback control (cfc) formalism (see the Refs.
eﬃcient scheme should instead involve a term +Ld[ˆzn(t) − δzn]/dt in the rhs of Eq. (1) (dissipative cfc), whence the
damping imposed results in a higher convergence to the desired solution ˆzn(t). Preliminary work in this direction is
being carried out and progress will be reported later.

VI. CONCLUSIONS - DISCUSSION

We have investigated, from ﬁrst principles, the possibility of existence of localized discrete breather-type excitations

associated with vertical dust grain motion in a dust mono-layer, which is assumed to be one-dimensional.

It may be noted, in concluding, that the localized structures presented in this Letter, owe their existence to the
intrinsic lattice discreteness in combination with the nonlinearity of the plasma sheath. Both are experimentally
tunable physical mechanisms, so our results may be investigated (and will hopefully be veriﬁed) by appropriately
designed experiments. The experimental conﬁrmation of their existence in dust crystals appears as a promising ﬁeld,
which may open new directions e.g. in the design of applications.

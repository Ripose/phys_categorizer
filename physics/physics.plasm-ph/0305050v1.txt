A closed expression for the momentum evolution of a test particle in weakly-coupled plasma is
derived, starting from quantum many particle theory. The particle scatters from charge ﬂuctuations
in the plasma rather than in a sequence of independent binary collisions. Contrary to general belief,
Bohr’s (rather than Bethe’s) Coulomb logarithm is the relevant one in most plasma applications. A
power-law tail in the distribution function is conﬁrmed by molecular dynamics simulation.

Though Coulomb scattering is a most basic process in
plasma and has been studied for a century [1], doubts
concerning the treatment as a sequence of independent
binary collisions remained [2, 3], and recent analysis
[4] has revealed that this standard assumption is not
justiﬁed in general and requires revision. Here we de-
rive the time-dependent many-particle wavefunction of
a test particle simultaneously interacting with N parti-
cles residing in the Debye sphere. The plasma parame-
ter N = nλ3 > 1 involves the plasma density n and the
screening length λ = max(vT /ωp, v0/ωp), where vT is the
thermal velocity of electrons, v0 the velocity of the test

particle, and ωp =
We emphasize that the collective interaction described
here is diﬀerent and in addition to Debye screening; it is
not included in the usual dielectric approach [5]. The new
results can be viewed as interaction of the test particle
with the charge ﬂuctuations inside the Debye sphere; in
this picture, the test particle of charge Z0e is scattered by
an eﬀective, spatially extended charge e√N rather than
by a sequence of binary collisions.

This has deep consequences for the Coulomb loga-

T ∼ n1/3) and the region of degenerate plasma (borderline:
T ∼ n2/3).

and this leads to a very diﬀerent picture in Fig.1b. Now
Lcl applies to almost the entire high-temperature region,
including e.g. the important domain of magnetic fusion
plasmas, while Lq plays only a marginal role.

Let us ﬁrst discuss this result in qualitative terms. A
particular feature of the Coulomb (1/r) interaction is
of crucial importance in this case, namely that scatter-
ing does not depend on α and ~, as we know from the
Rutherford cross section. The diﬀerence between α < 1
and α > 1 regions arises only when the potential devi-
ates from 1/r, as it is the case in a plasma due to De-
bye screening occurring at long distances λ. This means
the distinction between classical and quantum treatment
reveals itself for small-angle scattering, while close colli-
sions with large-angle scatter are not aﬀected. This point
has been emphasized strongly by Bohr (see p.448 in [1])
and also in Sivukhin’s review [3] (p. 109–113). In accor-
dance with Bohr “any attempt to attribute the diﬀerence

between [the classical α
1 cases]
to the obvious failure of [the classical] pictures in ac-
counting for collisions with an impact parameter smaller
than [the de Broglie wave–length] will be entirely irrel-
evant. In fact, this argument would imply a diﬀerence
between two distribution for the large angle scattering,
while the actual diﬀerences occur only in the limits of
small angles.”

≪

Now let us compare the classical scattering angle δcl =
(Z0e e∗/m0v2
0)/λ at distance λ with that of quantum
diﬀraction δq = (~/m0v0)/λ [7]. The open question here
concerns the eﬀective net charge e∗ which the test particle
experiences when passing the Debye sphere. The value of
e∗ is not evident, because we are dealing with Coulomb
collisions at distances much larger than 1/n1/3. The bi-
nary collision approximation circumvents this predica-
ment by alleging that the total scattering can be treated
as the sum of independent binary interactions happening
at diﬀerent times [3]. One is then led to take e∗ = e for
granted instead of actually calculating e∗. The central
result of this paper will be that the eﬀective charge is
eN 1/2. The matching condition

ory underlying Fig. 1b will now be derived. As a central
result, we also present molecular dynamics simulations
conﬁrming the analytic theory.

The present analysis starts from a full quantum-
mechanical description of the plasma in terms of the
many-particle wave-function ψ = exp(iS/~). The action

Eq. (1) is equivalent to the exact Schr¨odinger equation
and has the form of a Hamilton-Jacoby equation with
additional terms that are proportional to ~ and describe
quantum eﬀects. We examine the solution of Eq. (1) for

we solved the nonlinear equation (1) exactly, we had
obtained a non–singular result with the maximum mo-
mentum transfer of 2δvj,kµj,k, as we know from Ruther-
ford scattering. The way to deal with this problem
is to cut out in the wavefunction those spatial regions
which do not satisfy Eq. (4). The cut-oﬀ (4) warrants
that the maximum momentum transfer 2δvj,kµj,k is pre-
served; this can be veriﬁed by operating with
∇j
on exp(iS/~). It should be understood that this short-
range cut-oﬀ is a technical correction (compare with [1],
p. 448–449:”. . . the central region of the ﬁeld. . . , which,
on classical mechanics, is responsible for all large angle
scattering will, for α
1,. . . gives rise to only a frac-
tion of the order α4 of the Rutherford scattering”). It
has nothing in common with diﬀerences between clas-
sical and quantum scattering. These reveal themselves
only at long ranges [1, 3]. Another detail concerning the
general wavefunction concerns the initial conditions. In
case the initial state of the plasma is deﬁned by the wave-
function φ(t = 0, p1, p2, . . . ) rather than by a ﬁxed set
of momenta, the corresponding general wavefunction is
given by

As it turns out, the explicit form of φ is of no relevance
in the applications discussed below.

We now have at our disposal in analytical form the
time-dependent many-particle wavefunction describing a
dilute high-temperature plasma. This is a remarkable
result. An outstanding feature is that it describes simul-
taneous multiple Coulomb interactions between the par-
ticles and, in this respect, goes beyond the binary colli-
sion approximation. Another essential property is that it

though tedious, and therefore we can give here only the
main results, leaving technical derivations to a separate
publication.

electron–projectile and ion–projectile interaction. In the
following, most of the discussion is restricted to Me.

Let us discuss the structure of Eqs. (6),(7), which are
presented here for the ﬁrst time. The detailed analy-
sis is quite intricate, and here we give only the main
results without derivation. We observe that only small
enough fe can contribute to M and that therefore, ow-
ing to the large multiplier N in Eq. (6), the sin2-term
needs to be small and can be expanded. Then M de-
pends essentially on the parameter combination α2N
only; more rigorous analysis gives γ = α2N ln N . The

We have checked the occurrence of this power-law tail
by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We consider
vth scattered completely classi-
a test particle with v0 ≫
cally in a ﬁnite plasma volume, having dimensions l of the
order of the screening length. The simulation has been
performed for a model case with N = 80 and α = 1.9,
just feasible on a modern PC. Results are plotted in Fig. 2
for time t = 2l/v0 < t1 . The histogram presenting the
MD results is in best agreement with the present the-
ory (solid curve), clearly showing the power-law tail at
high momenta. For comparison, also the purely Gaussian
distribution obtained from the Landau collision integral
is given as dashed line. Details of these simulations are
outlined in the caption. Here we should make it clear
that the power law tail originating from close collisions
is obtained in nearly identical form within the binary
collision approach, as it was shown by Landau [8] and
Vavilov [9]. The present theory diﬀers for small-angle
scattering and therefore in the Gaussian part of M (t, Q).
To show the diﬀerence quantitatively, we have also solved
the kinetic equation used in [8, 9]. The result can be writ-
ten in a form equivalent to Eq. (5) with the function fe
now given approximately by f (b)

cm−3; the cold plasma limit is chosen with thermal velocity
vth ≪ v0. The plasma volume is taken as V = 6l × 2l × 2l
with the test particle (Z0 = 2, m0 = me) moving along
the central axis in x-direction and starting at a distance 2l
from the surface. The trajectory of the test particle,
in-
teracting with all Coulomb centers, is obtained by solving
the classical equation of motion by a second-order scheme
with an adaptive time step. The histogram corresponds to
2.06×105 independent trials. The solid line has been obtained
numerically from Eqs. (6)–(7) with Fi = Fe = exp(−fe).
The screening length is set to λ = l such that the ﬁnite

The eﬀect of the present theory is that the Gaussian part
grows more rapidly. This is consistent with enhanced
small-angle scattering due to simultaneous interaction
with many plasma particles.

may be understood qualitatively looking at second-order
processes. Consider the perturbation of the interaction
of the test particle with a plasma particle j by another
plasma particle k. This eﬀect is small of order α2, but
since for a plasma with long–range Coulomb forces N
particles contribute to this second-order process, it can
be neglected only if α2N < 1.

In conclusion,

it has been shown that the theory
of Coulomb scattering in dilute plasma needs revision.
Bohr’s classical Coulomb logarithm Lcl is found to apply
for α√N > 1 rather than α > 1, and this covers most
of the density-temperature plane, relevant to practical
applications. This result calls for experimental veriﬁca-
tion. We propose to measure energy loss of fully stripped
ions in carefully characterized, fully ionized plasma lay-
ers. The parametrically diﬀerent dependence of Lcl and
Lq on ion charge Z0 and velocity v0 should allow for a
clear distinction.

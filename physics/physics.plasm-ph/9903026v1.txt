We study the eﬀect of neutral atoms on the dynamics of a capillary discharge Z-pinch, in a regime
for which a large soft-x-ray ampliﬁcation has been demonstrated. We extended the commonly used
one-ﬂuid magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) model by separating out the neutral atoms as a second
ﬂuid. Numerical calculations using this extended model yield new predictions for the dynamics of
the pinch collapse, and better agreement with known measured data.

Z-pinch collapse has been extensively studied since the
late 50s, being a simple and eﬀective way of producing
hot and dense plasma. In this process, an electric cur-
rent ﬂowing through a plasma column, interacts with its
self magnetic ﬁeld, and the resulting force contracts the
plasma column in the radial direction. Today Z-pinch
plasma is widely used for various applications such as
high power radiation sources and neutron sources [1,2].
An exciting new application of Z-pinch plasma was re-
cently demonstrated by Rocca et. al. [3–5]. In this work,
large ampliﬁcation of soft-x-ray light was obtained in Ne-
like Ar and S plasma, created by a fast (∼ 40 ns) Z-pinch
discharge inside a capillary. Compared with the alterna-
tive approach of laser driven excitation [6,7], the capil-
lary discharge has the advantage of allowing for compact
(table-top), eﬃcient and simpler soft-x-ray lasers.

In this paper we study the role of neutral atoms in the
dynamics of a capillary discharge Z-pinch, in the regime
for which soft-x-ray ampliﬁcation was demonstrated.
The commonly used one-ﬂuid magneto-hydrodynamics
(MHD) model assumes that all the particles in the plasma
are charged, and drift together. We, however, show that
for the case discussed here, large portions of the plasma
contain an appreciable amount of neutral atoms. Since
these are not aﬀected by the electro-magnetic forces, but
only by the much weaker mechanical forces, they ﬂow
with much smaller velocities than the ions and the elec-
trons. To account for this eﬀect, we extend the one-
ﬂuid MHD model by introducing a separate ﬂuid for the
neutral atoms (in addition to the standard electrons-ions
ﬂuid). Results of calculations using this extended model
give new predictions for the dynamics of the pinch col-
lapse, with some features in better resemblance with the
measured data. This conﬁrms our previously reported
estimates [8].

We start with the standard one-ﬂuid two-temperature
MHD model, commonly used for numerical calculations
of Z-pinch processes [9–13]. It considers hydrodynamic
ﬂow including shock waves, heat conduction, heat ex-
change (between ions and electrons), magnetic ﬁeld dy-
namics, magnetic forces, Ohmic heating, radiative cool-
ing and ionization. We use a simple ionization model,
and assume a quasi steady state, taking into account col-

lisional ionization, and 2-Body and 3-Body recombina-
tion. Since the plasma is assumed to be optically thin,
ionization and excitation by radiation are neglected. The
latter assumption should hold at least to the end of the
collapse. This model is incorporated into our numerical
code, SIMBA, where the equations of motion of the sys-
tem (see [9–14]) are solved in a Lagrangean mesh [15],
assuming one-dimensional axial symmetry.

Shown to be remarkably stable [16], and having a high
length-to-diameter ratio (of 50-500), the capillary dis-
charge Z-pinch experiment is naturally described in the
framework of this 1-D MHD model. Previously reported
works [10], have indicated that taking into account abla-
tion of the plastic capillary wall is necessary for the cor-
rect description of the pinch dynamics. According to this
the calculation should thus be extended to include a nar-
row region of the plastic capillary wall. However, it was
also shown in [10] that even with this eﬀect taken into
account, good agreement with the measured data still
requires some major artiﬁcial adjustments of the plasma
transport coeﬃcients. We have repeated these calcula-
tions using the same one-ﬂuid MHD model, and found
them to agree with the reported results. In particular,
we also ﬁnd that the measured data is reproduced by one-
ﬂuid MHD calculations only when artiﬁcial adjustments
are introduced, as demonstrated in Fig. (1). The ﬁgure
displays the calculated radius of the collapsing Ar plasma
as a function of time in a capillary discharge Z-pinch. The
parameters of the calculations are those used for soft-x-
ray ampliﬁcation experiments [3,4,10]: initial Ar density
of ρ0 = 1.7·10−6g./cm3 or n0 ≈ 2.5·1016atoms/cm3, ini-
tial temperature of T0 ≈ 0.5eV, and a maximum current
of 39kA, with its peak at t=32ns [17]. The ﬁgure also
presents some measured data, of the radius of soft-x-ray
source, as a function of time, taken from [10]. Since the
radii of the soft-x-ray source and that of the collapsing Ar
plasma are related, it is clear that there are disagreements
between the calculated and measured data: For example,
the calculated pinch peak is about 10ns earlier than the
measured one. It is shown in Fig. (1) that multiplying
the classical electrical conductivity [18] by a factor of 15,
results in a good agreement with the measured instant of
the pinch peak, however at the same time it also spoils

the agreement with measured collapse velocity. We no-
tice that both calculations do not properly reproduce the
initial stages of the collapse, which is delayed by about
10-15ns. According to [10], reproducing the whole stages
of the measured collapse requires more artiﬁcial adjust-
ments in the plasma transport parameters, up to 20-40
times their classical values. This need for artiﬁcial adjust-
ments of plasma parameters in one-dimensional one-ﬂuid
MHD calculations cannot be explained by two- or three-
dimensional eﬀects in the modeled experiment: The work
of Bender et. al. [16] has proven a perfect azimuthal
(φ-direction) symmetry in this same capillary discharge
Z-pinch, and the demonstrated ampliﬁcation gain [3–5]
indicates a very good Z-direction symmetry.

In order to better understand the dynamics of the
pinch collapse, we have focused our study on the impor-
tance and the role of neutral atoms in this process. The
one-ﬂuid MHD model assumes that the plasma consists
of two components: electrons and eﬀective single-type
ions, with their charge being the average charge of all
the diﬀerently charged ions in the plasma, including the

assumed to ﬂow together, as a single ﬂuid. This assump-
tions are reasonable for regimes for which at least one of
the two following conditions is fulﬁlled: (i) All the atoms
in the plasma are ionized, or, (ii) The neutral atoms are
strongly coupled to the charged particles, and hence fol-
low them in the same single ﬂuid.

Fig.

(2) presents the percentage of neutral atoms
as a function of electron temperature in Argon plasma,
based on our ionization model. According to this ﬁg-
ure, a plasma of electron temperature lower than 2-3 eV
contains an appreciable amount of neutrals. In Carbon

plasma, which is a typical representative of the ablated
capillary wall, the picture is similar. Our MHD calcula-
tions show that the Ar plasma starts to heat up above
2-3 eV only 5 ns after the beginning of the pinch, and its
central region stays below this temperature for the next
25 ns [8]. Major portions of the plastic wall plasma re-
main below 2-3eV even after the pinch collapses at the
axis. The percentage of neutral atoms in the plasma is
hence far from being negligible. We thus conclude that
condition (i) does not hold. The plasma contains three
diﬀerent components: electrons, ions, and neutral atoms.
We now turn to check whether or not condition (ii) is sat-
isﬁed, by examining the couplings between these diﬀerent
ingredients of the plasma. The electrons and ions, being

charged particles, are coupled through Coulomb forces.
A measure of the strength of this coupling is given by
the plasma frequency, ωP . For the case discussed here,
1/ωP ≈ 10−5 − 10−3ns, which is negligible compared to
the typical pinch collapse times of τpinch ≈ 40ns. This
means that the coupling between the electrons and ions
is very strong, and that they practically drift together, as
a single ﬂuid. The neutral atoms, however, are coupled
to the charged particles only by collisions, and may thus
ﬂow separately, as a second ﬂuid. We therefore assume
two ﬂuids, one of charged-species (electrons and ions) and
the other of neutral-species (atoms), with ﬂow velocities
ui and ua respectively. The collisional momentum trans-
fer between these two ﬂuids is evaluated assuming a hard
spheres approximation: We regard the two ﬂuids as two
clouds of hard spheres, drifting through one another. In
that case, the collision frequency per unit volume equals:

ai = α · r2
νcoll

a · na · ni · |ua − ui|

(1)

and the collisional momentum transfer rate, per unit vol-
ume, is thus

ai = α · r2
F coll

(2)

where α is a coeﬃcient of about 2π. Here r stands for
the particle radius, m for its mass, and n stands for the
number density. The indices a, i denote atoms and ions

Similarly, the one-ﬂuid MHD ion-energy equation [9–13])
is also properly amended, and separate atom-energy
equation for the neutral-species ﬂuid is introduced. Colli-
sions between the two ﬂuids, as well as particles exchange
due to ionization and recombination are considered in
these equations in the same manner as in the mass and
momentum equations. The MHD electron-energy equa-
tion is left unchanged.

The force in Eq. (2), F coll

, depends quadratically on
the velocity diﬀerence between the charged-species and
the neutral-species ﬂuids. This coupling thus restrains
the separation between the two ﬂuids. Taking reasonable
densities of na ≈ 1016, ni ≈ 1015 (10% ionization), and an
appreciable velocity diﬀerence of |ua − ui| ≈ 106cm/s, we
get for Ar plasma a collisional coupling term of the order
of 106dyn/cm3. This is 2-3 orders-of-magnitude less then

We conclude that in the regime discussed here, both
of the above conditions for the validity of the one-ﬂuid
MHD fail to be satisﬁed. The two ﬂuids are indeed ex-
pected to ﬂow separately. However, they exchange mass,
momentum and energy due to exchange of particles (by
ionization and recombination) and due to atoms-ions col-
lisions. By Sa(r, t) we denote the mass sink (per unit
volume, per unit time) in the neutral-species ﬂuid due to
ionization of neutral atoms (Sa ≥ 0). Sa plays a role of
a source in the charged-species ﬂuid. Similarly, Si(r, t)
denotes the mass sink in the charged-species ﬂuid, due to
recombination of ions+1 (Si ≥ 0). The total mass trans-
fer from the neutral-species ﬂuid into the charged-species
ﬂuid due to ionization and recombination is thus Sa − Si.
To account for the exchange of mass, momentum and
energy between the two ﬂuids the standard one-ﬂuid
MHD for the charged-species ﬂuid (see [14] for exam-
ple) are amended, and new, separate equations for the
neutral-species ﬂuid are added. The revised mass equa-
tion for the charged-species ﬂuid is then (we use cylin-

glected (standard one-ﬂuid MHD). Thick line: Neutral atoms

These equations were incorporated into our SIMBA
code. For simplicity, and in order to emphasize the ef-
fect introduced by separating the neutral atoms from the
charged-species ﬂuid, we assume, in the following calcula-
tions, that the capillary wall is also made of Argon. The
other pinch parameters are left unchanged, however we
now use the classical transport coeﬃcients [18], without
any artiﬁcial adjustments. Fig. (3) shows the eﬀect of
the neutral-species ﬂuid on the calculated outer bound-
ary of the collapsing Ar plasma. It is clearly indicated
that the eﬀect of the neutral component in the capillary
discharge Z-pinch is not negligible. When the neutral-
species ﬂuid is included the collapse seems to be delayed,
however after it starts it is more rapid. This trend seems
to better resemble the data presented in Fig. (1), where
it was shown that compared to one-ﬂuid MHD calcula-
tions the measured collapse is delayed, and after it starts
the collapse rate is much higher.

We have also examined the eﬀect of neutral atoms on

is taken into account, the collapsing plasma sheath is
wider and less dense, compared to the predictions of the

model, the atoms and ions are assumed to ﬂow together
with the electrons. The magnetic forces, which are domi-
nant in this case, thus accelerate the whole plasma body.
In reality, however, only the ions ﬂow together with the
electrons, while the neutral atoms ﬂow separately. Since
the plasma is initially mostly neutral, the magnetic forces
act only on a small fraction of the total mass, which is
then rapidly accelerated inwards. Most of the Ar stays
outside, almost at rest. While the process evolves, more
atoms get ionized, and join the charged-species ﬂuid.
This eﬀect is seen in Fig. (3) as a delay in the collapse.
At any given spatial and temporal point, the magnetic
forces act on a “freshly” ionized matter, almost at rest.
The resulting acceleration is thus more gradual, leading
to a wider and less dense plasma sheath, as seen from
Fig. (4).

In conclusion, we have shown that the eﬀect of neu-
tral atoms on the dynamics of the capillary discharge Z-
pinch is not negligible. We have demonstrated that sep-
arating out the neutral atoms as a second ﬂuid produces
a diﬀerent pinch collapse dynamics, with some features
similar to the measured data.
It is expected that the
improved modeling of the pinch collapse dynamics will
yield a better understanding of capillary discharge X-ray
lasers, since the ampliﬁcation gain, as well as the propa-
gation and refraction of radiation in the lasing media are
both dominated by the details of the plasma state.

1-D Eulerian Vlasov-Maxwell simulations are presented which show kinetic enhancement of stim-
ulated Raman backscatter (SRBS) due to electron trapping in regimes of heavy linear Landau
damping. The conventional Raman Langmuir wave is transformed into a set of beam acoustic
modes [L. Yin et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 025401 (2006)]. For the ﬁrst time, a low phase velocity elec-
tron acoustic wave (EAW) is seen developing from the self-consistent Raman physics. Backscatter
of the pump laser oﬀ the EAW ﬂuctuations is reported and referred to as electron acoustic Thomson
scatter. This may account for the reﬂected light between the pump and SRBS wavelengths observed
in single hot spot experiments, and previously interpreted as stimulated electron acoustic scatter
[D. S. Montgomery et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 155001 (2001)]. The EAW is strongest well below
the phase-matched frequency for electron acoustic scatter, and therefore the EAW is not produced
by it. The beating of diﬀerent beam acoustic modes is proposed as the EAW excitation mechanism,
and is called beam acoustic decay. Supporting evidence for this process, including bispectral anal-
ysis, is presented. The linear electrostatic modes, found by projecting the numerical distribution
function onto a Gauss-Hermite basis, include beam acoustic modes (some of which are unstable even
without parametric coupling to light waves) and a strongly-damped EAW similar to the observed
one. This linear EAW results from non-Maxwellian features in the electron distribution, rather than
nonlinearity due to electron trapping.

INTRODUCTION

The role of kinetic eﬀects in stimulated Raman
backscatter (SRBS) is of much current interest. SRBS
is the three-wave parametric coupling of a pump light
wave (the laser, labeled mode 0) to a counter-propagating
daughter light wave (mode 1) and co-propagating elec-
tron plasma wave (EPW, mode 2), and satisﬁes the res-
onance conditions ~k0 = ~k1 + ~k2 and ω0 = ω1 + ω2. It
may remove a substantial amount of energy from a high-
intensity laser propagating through a plasma and create
energetic electrons [1]. SRBS and other laser-plasma in-
teractions must be suﬃciently controlled for laser-driven
inertial fusion to succeed. In the high-temperature plas-
mas expected on ignition experiments such as the Na-
tional Ignition Facility (NIF) [2] and Laser M´egajoule
(LMJ) [3], linear theory of parametric instabilities pre-
dicts SRBS to have a weak spatial gain rate due to the
[ǫ0Te/(n0e2)]1/2 is the electron De-
large k2λD (λD ≡
bye length) and resulting heavy Landau damping. How-
ever, recent experiments [4, 5, 6] and kinetic simulations
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] have shown SRBS reﬂectivities well
above coupled-mode convective gain levels.

This kinetic inﬂation or enhancement of SRBS is
widely attributed to electron trapping in the EPW po-

tential well, which ﬂattens the electron distribution func-
tion near the EPW phase velocity vp2 [7, 13]. As has
long been known, trapping reduces the EPW damping
rate [14] and induces an amplitude-dependent frequency
downshift [15]. SRBS saturation results from the compe-
tition of nonlinear eﬀects including the damping reduc-
tion, frequency shift, pump depletion, and trapped par-
ticle instability [16], and possibly spatio-temporal chaos
after ion modes build up near the laser entrance [17],
among others. A theory for the onset of kinetic inﬂation
and the resulting time-averaged reﬂectivity is not yet in
hand, but would be of great value for designing laser fu-
sion implosions.

This current work is aimed at better understanding ki-
netic eﬀects such as electron trapping in SRBS for time
scales and frequencies such that ion dynamics can be ig-
nored. To this end, we have performed 1-D Eulerian
Vlasov-Maxwell simulations of SRBS using the ELVIS
code [11, 12, 18]. A rapid increase of reﬂectivity above
the convective value is seen as we vary parameters such as
the pump intensity. The system does not reach a tempo-
ral steady state when kinetic enhancement occurs, but in-
stead the reﬂectivity comes in sub-picosecond bursts. Be-
sides enhancing SRBS, trapping also changes the electro-
static modes present. Electrostatic spectra from our sim-
ulations reveal the EPW dispersion curve splits into an
upper branch and several beam acoustic modes (BAMs)
[9, 10], and that SRBS involves one of the latter. The
SRBS daughter BAM activity occurs along the streak

that phase-matches for pump decay, which extends down
in frequency from the linear phase-matching point with
a slope equal to the daughter light wave’s group velocity
c. This behavior has been seen in Thomson scat-
vg1 ≈ −
tering spectra from recent Trident experiments [19] and
PIC simulations [9].

∝

A low-amplitude acoustic wave (meaning that ω

k,
not an ion acoustic wave), which we call the electron
acoustic wave (EAW), also appears once inﬂation devel-
ops in our simulations. Moreover, weak reﬂected light
that phase-matches for scattering oﬀ this mode is also
seen, which we call electron acoustic scatter (EAS). This
is strongly reminiscent of what was called stimulated elec-
tron acoustic scatter (SEAS) and observed in Trident
single hot spot experiments [5, 6]. To our knowledge,
this paper is the ﬁrst to analyze in detail EAWs and
EAS arising from the SRBS dynamics, and not from dis-
torted distributions or other strong seeding. SEAS has
also been reported in PIC simulations of plasmas over-
dense to SRBS and at relativistic pump intensities [20],
and may have been seen in underdense Vlasov simula-
tions [21].

Most of the EAW energy in our simulations is much too
low-frequency to match EAS and must be produced in-
dependently. We propose the three-wave coupling of two
BAMs and an EAW, which can be called beam acous-
tic decay (BAD), as the EAW excitation mechanism.
Smaller-amplitude EAWs at higher frequency are sub-
sequently generated by harmonic coupling. The pump
laser then scatters oﬀ these ﬂuctuations, referred to be-
low as electron acoustic Thomson scatter (EATS). The
phase-matching needed for BAD and EATS is seen both
in electrostatic (k, ω) spectra and bispectral analysis.

We study the electrostatic mode structure by solv-
ing the linear dispersion relation for simulation distribu-
tions projected onto a Gauss-Hermite basis. This yields
the BAMs and EAW seen in our simulation spectra,
and shows a damping reduction and frequency downshift
(compared to the EPW for a Maxwellian) of the BAM
involved in SRBS. The BAMs are linearly unstable - in
the absence of parametric coupling to light waves - for
some wavenumber range. In addition, we ﬁnd an EAW
root with heavy damping. This linear EAW diﬀers from
the nonlinear EAW due to trapping discussed by others
[22, 23, 24, 25, 26], which unlike ours is undamped and
cuts oﬀ at kλD ≈
The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents
the model equations and geometry used in the ELVIS
code. The dependence of SRBS on pump strength for
simulations of Trident single hot spot conditions is dis-
cussed in Sec. III. Kinetically-inﬂated SRBS, and the
related beam acoustic modes and electron acoustic scat-
ter, are carefully studied in Sec. IV for a pump inten-
sity of 2 PW/cm2. Section V demonstrates that simi-
lar physics occurs in higher temperature, higher density
plasmas found in hohlraum ﬁlls. We conclude in Sec. VI,
and derive the Gauss-Hermite mode-ﬁnding method in
the Appendix.

II. MODEL AND NUMERICAL APPROACH

We use the Eulerian Vlasov-Maxwell solver ELVIS
[11, 12, 18], which resembles the code presented in [27].
Our code implements the simplest model which allows
for electron kinetic eﬀects in Raman scattering. The ge-
ometry is one-dimensional, with all spatial variation and
wavevectors in the x direction. We describe the particle
species by the nonrelativistic Vlasov equation in x and
keep the ions ﬁxed in this paper. The light waves are lin-
early polarized in y, and the particles constitute a cold
collisionless ﬂuid in this direction (the light waves are
undamped). The geometry is illustrated in Fig. 1.

The governing equations are:

erated by SRBS and to reduce ﬂuctuations generated as
the electron density adjusts to a sheath-like pattern. A
nonzero central value of νKs can mimic transverse side-
loss from a laser speckle, although νKs = 0 outside the
damping regions in this paper.

The Vlasov equation for the distribution function fs is
solved on a ﬁxed phase-space grid via operator splitting
[28]. The spatial and velocity advections are performed
via a semi-Lagrangian method (shift along characteris-
tics) with cubic spline interpolation. The x shift is peri-

odic with fs(xL) = fs(xR), although the dynamics in the
central region are eﬀectively ﬁnite in x due to the damp-
ing regions and sheaths at the edges (subscripts L and
R denote quantities at the left and right edges, respec-
tively; see Fig. 1). For the vx shift, fs is assumed zero for
> vmax and replenished from the initial Maxwellian
vx|
|
to conserve ns. The transverse light-wave variables E+
and E− advect to the right and left, respectively. We
advance E± without dispersion (in vacuum) by shifts of
one x gridpoint, which locks the x and t spacings by
dx = c dt. The extreme edges of the simulation box,
beyond the periodicity points (xL, xR) of fs, are “moat”
0 for all time, but E± propagate until
regions where fs ≡
leaving the system. We specify E±(t) at the boundary
from which each ﬁeld is advected into the box, and can
thereby inject a (pump, seed) light wave via (E+, E−).
Due to the low numerical noise in our Vlasov code,
SRBS does not develop if only the pump light wave is in-
cident and the damping regions are used (although SRBS
can occur with no damping regions). We therefore in-
clude a low-amplitude SRBS seed with a frequency that
satisﬁes linear phase-matching based on the kinetic EPW
dispersion relation. The physics is similar in runs where
the seed was turned oﬀ after kinetically-enhanced SRBS
develops.

INTENSITY SCALING OF SRBS FOR

TRIDENT CONDITIONS

Simulations with conditions similar to the Trident sin-
gle hot spot experiments [6] reveal a sudden onset of
kinetically-enhanced SRBS as the pump strength in-
creases. We use a pump vacuum wavelength λ0 = 527
nm, background electron density n0 = 0.025nc (ω0/ωp =
6.32) where nc is the pump critical density (n0/nc =
(ωp/ω0)2), and an electron temperature Te = 0.5 keV.
The central ﬂattop (between the Krook damping re-
gions) has length 75.4 µm. We inject an SRBS seed
with λ1s = 653.4 nm (ω1s/ωp = 5.10) and intensity
I1R = 10−5I0L at the right edge, where I0L is the pump
intensity at the left edge (in this paper, a constant I0
independent of x and t is understood to be I0L). The
pump and seed light waves beat to drive an EPW with
k2λD = 0.352. In all runs we set dx = λ2/20 and vx grid
spacing dvx < vtr/4. vtr ≡
2ωB/k2 is the trapping island

half-width in the beat-driven EPW, ωB ≡

EPW density perturbation peak amplitude. The v grid

For weak pumps the simulation gains are small and
in accord with the coupled-mode calculation, but they
suddenly rise well above it for I0 = 0.4 PW/cm2 (ki-
netic inﬂation or enhancement). Rav barely increases
with pump strength and saturates around 1% for I0 >
1
PW/cm2. This is well below the coupled-mode level for
∼
the largest pump strengths and indicaties nonlinearities
besides pump depletion saturate SRBS (kinetic deﬂa-
tion).

We do not expect trapping to be important in SRBS
unless a resonant electron undergoes at least one bounce
cycle before crossing the gain region. This happens for
all the runs in Fig. 2 using the convective steady-state
ﬁelds. The above criterion treats longitudinal endloss
as the only de-trapping mechanism, since we have not
included transverse sideloss (e.g., via the Krook opera-
tor) in our runs. Morales and O’Neil calculate the time-
dependent damping rate and frequency of an undriven
EPW as an initial value problem [14, 15]. After the res-
onant electrons complete about one bounce cycle, Lan-
dau damping is substantially reduced, and the frequency
shift is roughly its late-time asymptotic value. These
results easily translate to a boundary value problem, ap-
propriate to our ﬁnite geometry. However, driven EPW’s
like in SRBS may diﬀer quantitatively from Morales and
O’Neil’s free-wave calculation.

SCATTER

A. Reﬂected Light

We now study in detail the case I0 = 2 PW/cm2 to ex-
pose the physics of kinetic enhancement and EAS. Figure
3 displays the instantaneous reﬂectivity, with time aver-
age Rav = 1.03% that greatly exceeds the coupled-mode
10−4. Moreover, R(t) occurs
level from Eq. (9) of 7.75
in temporal sub-picosecond bursts instead of becoming
steady, as has also been reported in PIC simulations (e.g.,
Ref. [7]).

×

The time-resolved spectrum of reﬂected light is dis-
played in Fig. 4(a). SRBS is the dominant signal. Early
in time it occurs at the seed frequency ω1s but up-
shifts once SRBS becomes strongly enhanced around 3
ps. This results from the trapping-induced EPW fre-
quency downshift [15]. Scattered light between the SRBS
and pump frequencies is observed shortly after the up-
shift. The time-integrated power spectrum, contained in
Fig. 4(b), reveals EAS is much stronger than the “noise
level” in neighboring frequencies (partly due to SRBS
sidelobes resulting from windowing). The EAS reﬂectiv-
10−8, found by time-averaging the re-

ﬂected light ﬁltered to pass the band ω = (5.8
during the time EAS is observed (t > 2 ps). The broad
spectrum of reﬂected light for ω1 < ω1s, larger than the
signal for ω1 > ω1s, is scattering oﬀ electrostatic ﬂuctua-
tions (possibly from BAMs) with ω > ω2 visible in Figs.
6(a) and 11.

All power spectra in this paper were made using
Welch’s method of averaged overlapping modiﬁed peri-
odograms, with Kaiser window functions [30, 31]. Ag-
gressive windowing was needed to reveal weak, time-
dependent signals, such as EAS in the presence of much
larger SRBS. The low noise inherent in Vlasov codes al-
lows such weak processes to be captured.

B. Electrostatic Activity

We now turn to the electrostatic activity. Fig. 5
presents the envelope of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld
Ex(x, t), rms-averaged over one SRBS wavelength and
period. Once SRBS enters the enhanced regime, the
plasma waves propagate away from the laser entrance
along fairly well-deﬁned “rays” with group velocities
vT e. Three broad “bursts,” which are strong near the
≈
laser entrance around 3, 6, and 10 ps, correspond to re-
ﬂectivity bursts in Fig. 3. The initial break-up of the
envelope into rays, near the laser entrance shortly after 1
ps, may be due to the trapped particle instability [16, 32],
and coincides with the ﬁrst, isolated spike in reﬂectiv-
ity at 1.3 ps. In particular, the envelope is modulated
0.05, which is close to kBλD = 0.066 calcu-
at kλD ≈

curve, mostly on a frequency-downshifted streak relative
to the matched EPW. While there is some activity on
the EPW curve for k < 0, the curve splits into upper
and lower branches near kλD = 0.2. The extended activ-
ity lower in frequency than the EPW curve, and which
becomes acoustic (ω
k) with a larger slope for small k,
is analogous to the beam acoustic modes (BAMs) found
by L. Yin et al. [9].

k. The most strongly-excited EAW has a frequency
0.15ωp well above the ion plasma and ion acoustic wave

glected. Spectra over successive time windows reveal the
EAW is ﬁrst excited at, and is always strong for, lower k.
The EAW and EAS both develop after kinetic enhance-
ment of SRBS begins, which suggests they result from
SRBS-induced modiﬁcations of the electron distribution.

FIG. 6: Power spectrum of Ex over the (x, t) domain of Fig. 5 for I0 = 2 PW/cm2 Trident run. The “EPW” curve is the
EPW for the initial Maxwellian, and the “Stokes” curve is deﬁned in the text. The “EAS” point at 0.385ωp is phase-matched
with the EAS asterisk in Fig. 4(b). Panels (b) and (c) are zooms of the SRBS and EAW regions of panel (a).

far from the phase-matched point. Also, the amplitude
is not increased near the phase-matched point, implying
decay of the pump laser does not signiﬁcantly change
the EAW level. The scattering from the EAW appears
to be oﬀ independently-generated ﬂuctuations and can
be viewed as electron acoustic Thomson scatter (EATS)
in analogy with Thomson scattering from conventional
plasma waves.

We propose that a three-wave interaction involving dif-
ferent parts of the extended BAM feature generates the
low-k EAWs, and dub this process beam acoustic decay
(BAD). The rest of the EAW curve is weakly excited
by EAW harmonic coupling (harmonics of an acoustic
mode lie on the same acoustic curve). BAD is likely
a two-pump process (instead of a pure parametric de-
cay), where the BAM curve is energized separately from
BAD, and BAMs with diﬀerent (k, ω) then beat to pro-
duce EAWs. This is supported by the fact that the
low-k BAM tail does not have a noticeable peak cor-
responding to the daughter BAM in BAD. Moreover,
one can estimate the ratio of daughter-wave amplitudes
from coupled-mode theory. For weakly damped BAMs
and a strongly-damped EAW (appropriate for the lin-
ear modes found in Sec. IV C), and neglecting pump de-

pletion, the ratio of daughter BAM to daughter EAW
actions is (νe/γb)2 where νe is the EAW damping rate
and γb is the BAD growth rate. For undamped daugh-
ters the actions are equal (the tradition Manley-Rowe
relation). The Ex power ratio from Fig. 6 is very large:
104. Still, without formulae for the
Ex,bam/Ex,eaw|
|
BAD growth rate and how electric ﬁelds relate to actions,
it is diﬃcult to infer from this that little of the BAM is
produced by BAD. We discuss the generation of BAMs
below.

The EAW and resulting EAS occur for moderate pump
strengths. Neither appear when SRBS is not kinetically
enhanced. They increase with I0 above the enhancement
threshold, until the upshift in ω1 due to the nonlinear
downshift of the SRBS EPW is so large that a distinct
EAS peak is not visible for I0 > 5 PW/cm2. Above
this pump strength, the reﬂected light energy near the
EAS frequency still increases with I0 (due to leakage from
strongly upshifted SRBS), but similar energy levels are
present in neighboring frequency intervals as well. A dis-
tinct EAW is seen for the I0 = 5 PW/cm2 run but blends
into a very board region of BAM activity for I0 = 10
PW/cm2.

We now examine the electron distribution fe and the
linear electrostatic modes it supports. Phase-space vor-
tices develop in the electric ﬁeld of the SRBS plasmon
and ﬂatten the space-averaged fe near vp2. Although
the vortices are regular for early times, once SRBS be-
comes enhanced they smear into each other. This indi-
cates a non-monochromatic spectrum and has been seen
to result, e.g., from the trapped particle instability in
Refs. [16, 32]. Figure 7 displays fe space- and time-
averaged over periods of 6.3/ωp and from (96-102)λ0v
(near the domain center) for the I0 = 2 PW/cm2 Tri-
dent run. The plateau width is somewhat correlated to
the local wave amplitude, but fe remains ﬂattened even
when the ﬁeld is weak. This suggests nonlocality may be
important in kinetically-enhanced SRBS.

The averaged fe at 3.15 ps is plotted in Fig. 7 and
is fairly representative of fe during enhanced SRBS. The
observed ﬂattened plateau half-width of 1.5vT e compares
well with vtr = 1.47vT e from the observed amplitude
Exe/(meωpvT e) = 0.192. Note that fe(ve) in the trap-
ping region is nearly ﬂat (it actually increases by 1.6%
over its minimum for ve >
vp2). This is typical for fully-
∼
enhanced SRBS, although in the ﬁrst Raman burst there
is a clear period when dfe/dve > 0 for ve >
vp2. Such
∼
an upturn appears as the pinched bulge in Fig. 7 near
(t, ve)=(2 ps, 4vT e). Some adiabatic calculations of trap-
ping in EPWs show that fe should be symmetric about
the phase velocity when the wave amplitude decreases
and electrons are detrapped [33].
Figure 8 shows δf = fe −

fM at t = 3.15 ps, where
4, 0]vT e (close
fM is a Maxwellian ﬁt to fe for ve ∈
to the initial Maxwellian). Note δf consists of a broad,
beam-like structure near vp2 due to trapping, as well as
at two lower velocities. Modeling fe as a bulk-and-beam
distribution, such as a bi-Maxwellian, may not be correct,
especially for modes like EAWs with low phase velocities
near the secondary structures.

[

To gain insight into the electrostatic dynamics, we
study the linear modes of the numerically-obtained fe.
Although a large-amplitude electric ﬁeld is present and
may demand a nonlinear calculation, linear theory yields
good agreement with the observed spectrum. We project
δf onto a Gauss-Hermite basis, as described in the Ap-
pendix. This gives an analytic longitudinal susceptibility
χ, valid in the complex plane, as the sum of χ for fM and
the projected δf . Figure 8 displays the full δf and its
projection up to the N = 12 basis function and with the
3)/0.7. The projec-
scaled, shifted velocity u = (v/vT e −
tion only misses ﬁne-scale features which would appear
in higher-order basis functions. These features should
weakly distort the real frequency, which stems from col-
lective oscillations in fe, but may aﬀect the damping rate
more strongly, which depends on the slope of fe at the
phase velocity.

The electrostatic linear modes are obtained by solving

parametric coupling with light waves, which would allow
for SRBS. Fig. 9 presents the zero contours of ǫr and ǫi,
which intersect at the linear modes ǫ = 0, for fe from
Fig. 8. This plot over the same (k, ω) region only using
fM has two zero contours, which intersect at the linear
EPW; there is an inﬁnity of strongly-damped modes for
the Maxwellian, which fall below the chosen plot range.
As N is increased the contours change slightly, and a
single pair of ǫr = 0 and ǫi = 0 contours can split into
two pairs. However, the plot remains qualitatively the
same. This is further discussed in the Appendix.

Figure 10 graphs ﬁve modes calculated for fe from Fig.
8 (t = 3.15 ps) that resemble the observed spectrum. In
Fig. 11, ωr for these modes is superimposed on Ex(k, ω)
computed for t = 2.75
4.25 ps; the agreement is quite
good. The linear modes show the splitting of the EPW
curve into an upper branch and a set of BAMs, as well as
the appearance of an EAW. SRBS occurs along the mode
labeled BAM1, which is frequency-downshifted and less
damped than the Maxwellian EPW. Thus, much of the
nonlinear EPW physics of Morales and O’Neil is recov-
ered by linear theory with the modiﬁed fe, as also seen
in [34].

The upper branch and BAMs are linearly unstable for
some k, in the absence of coupling to light waves. Since
the slope of the modiﬁed fe is small or slightly positive for
some ve, it is reasonable to ﬁnd bump-on-tail or beam-
plasma instabilities. These beam-driven, growing electro-
static modes have been studied previously [35, 36], and
may account for the higher BAM ﬂuctuations compared
to the level of k < 0 conventional EPWs in Fig. 6. The
linear instability of BAMs allows them to be excited sep-
arately from BAD, which based on the discussion at the

end of Sec. IV B seems to have little eﬀect on the BAMs.
The linear modes also contain an EAW with ω/k de-
creasing from 1.05vT e to vT e as k increases. It is always
heavily damped, unlike the undamped nonlinear EAW
due to trapping discussed by other workers (e.g., Refs.
[23, 24]). An EAW also appears in an analogous mode
calculation for a bi-Maxwellian fe presented in Ref. [17],
with a beam whose drift velocity is close to that of the
EAW. It is shown there that stimulated (quasi-mode)
scattering oﬀ the EAW has a small, positive growth
rate. Possible phase-matched BAD triplets are shown in
Fig. 11. Note that the lowest-k daughter BAMs (white
circles) lie above the “knee” in the BAM feature, and
match with daughter EAWs (blue circles) higher in k
than the strongest EAW activity. The break in the BAM
streak may thus explain the cutoﬀ in the EAW spectrum,
although a calculation of the nonlinear coupling mecha-
nism (e.g., coupling coeﬃcients) would shed more light.

D. Bispectral Analysis

To further support the three-wave processes of BAD
and EATS, we turn to bispectral analysis [37, 38]. This
has been used previously to study three-wave interactions
in plasma physics, mostly in magnetized plasmas (Ref.
[39] is an early example). Although we do not pursue
it here, bispectral techniques can give estimates of the
coupling coeﬃcients and mode growth rates [40, 41, 42].

The power spectrum, or the Fourier transform of the
two-point correlation function, can be generalized to cor-
relations among more signals at more times, or higher-
order spectra. Given three real, zero-mean signals x(t),
y(t), and z(t), their correlation function C3 and complex
bispectrum P3 are

The notation x

and Eq. (16) shows why x is treated diﬀerently. We
compute the bispectrum by a generalization of Welch’s
method for power spectra [31]. Namely, we divide time
into N windows, apply a window function to the signals,
ﬁnd their Fourier transforms, and in each window form

EATS and scattering oﬀ BAM noise for ω1 < ω1s are
also present. Figure 13 displays P3 and b3 along the line
ω1 +ω2 = 6.32ωp; EATS is seen in both as a pair of peaks
below 6ωp. Given the incoherent, Thomson-like nature of
EATS, it is not surprising that it is much less bicoherent
than SRBS.

To examine BAD, we consider the bispectrum of
three spatial Fourier amplitudes a(k, t), computed from
Ex(x, t). To distinguish left- from right-moving waves,
we perform a 2D Fourier transform to the (k, ω) domain,
set the result to zero for all ω < 0, and then invert the
temporal transform. This procedure can be considered as
a Fourier transform in x and a Hilbert transform in t. For

P3 and more well-deﬁned peak in b3 than do k0’s closer to
the SRBS peak of 0.362. The strongly localized peak in

bicoherence peak, however, is seen only for certain k’s,
which shows when the EAW is driven by the beating of
the BAMs as opposed to satisfying the sum rule with less
dynamical coupling. The frequencies (ω0, ω1, ω2) where
P3 peaks give (k, ω) pairs that lie, respectively, slightly
below the SRBS peak, near the “knee” in the BAM fea-
ture, and near the maximum EAW amplitude.

V. HOHLRAUM PARAMETERS

To demonstrate that kinetically-enhanced SRBS,
BAMs, EAWs, and EATS are not peculiar to a nar-
row parameter range, we show in this section that they
occur in ignition hohlraum ﬁll plasmas as well as the
single hot spot conditions studied above. We choose a
pump wavelength λ0 = (1054/3) nm, background den-
sity n0 = 0.1nc, electron temperature Te = 3 keV, and
central Krook-free ﬂattop length of 75.2 µm. The SRBS
seed light wave has λ1s = 574.8 nm and I1R = 10−5I0,
which beats with the pump to produce a plasmon with
k2λD = 0.357 (similar to the above Trident value). The
time-averaged reﬂectivity Rav versus I0 is plotted in
Fig. 15 and shows an enhancement threshold of I0 = 0.8
PW/cm2, corresponding to NB = 2.03 bounce orbits in
the convective steady state. Note that here Rav for large
I0 saturates near 17%, which is much larger than the
Trident value of 1%.

We focus on the case I0 = 2 PW/cm2. Figure 16 dis-
plays the time-resolved reﬂected light spectrum. As for
the Trident runs, the SRBS light upshifts in frequency, at
which time EAS develops. The SRBS reﬂectivity is tem-
porally bursty with large pulses separated by about 1.5
ps. The electrostatic envelope (not shown) is similar to
Fig. 5, with four broad pulses propagating away from the

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Kinetic inﬂation of SRBS and related physics has been
studied with Eulerian Vlasov simulations in single hot
spot and hohlraum ﬁll conditions. Inﬂation of the reﬂec-
tivity above the coupled-mode steady state level develops
suddenly as the pump becomes stronger. The trapped
particle instability may modulate and break up the elec-
trostatic ﬁeld envelope early in time but does not dom-
inate the subsequent dynamics. Once trapping ﬂattens
the distribution, enhanced SRBS occurs in picosecond-
scale bursts accompanied by electrostatic pulses propa-
gating away from the laser entrance.

SRBS light upshifts in frequency due to trapping.
This can be viewed as due to a nonlinear downshift of
the daughter plasmon frequency, following Morales and
O’Neil, or as scattering oﬀ a lower-frequency linear mode
supported by the trapping-modiﬁed fe (in the spirit of
quasilinear theory). We adopt the latter approach, and
ﬁnd linear BAMs that agree with the observed electro-
static spectrum and give frequency-downshifted SRBS
plasma waves. Our Gauss-Hermite linear analysis reveals
a set of BAMs, some of which are unstable without light-
wave coupling and thus excitable by purely electrostatic
dynamics.

EAWs and EAS have been observed in our simula-
tions and understood in new ways. The Gauss-Hermite
method reveals the modiﬁed fe supports a heavily-
damped linear EAW, which diﬀers from the nonlinear,
undamped EAW reported by Rose and others. It is pre-
mature to say that EAWs generated by SRBS are a solely
linear phenomenon or that the nonlinear theories are ir-
relevant. Linear explanations nonetheless have a certain
appeal (Occam’s razor). Future work should explore the
impact of de-trapping mechanisms like speckle sideloss,
and broadband seeding in Vlasov simulations, on EAW
physics.

Our picture of EAW excitation is beam acoustic de-
cay (BAD), or the three-wave interaction of two BAMs
and an EAW. Given the very low EAW amplitudes, this
is likely a two-pump process, with the daughter BAM
generated separately. The daughter EAWs can weakly
couple to higher-k harmonics on the EAW curve. More-
over, fe is sometimes distorted (but not fully ﬂattened)
near the EAW phase velocity; this may lower its damp-
ing rate, or facilitate excitation of higher-k EAWs. The
pump laser scatters oﬀ the higher-k EAW ﬂuctuations,
which we think of as electron acoustic Thomson scatter
(EATS). We emphasize that the EAWs are strongest well

below the matching point for EAS, implying EAS excite
them.
In addition, the EAW amplitude shows no in-
crease at the EAS matching point, which again suggests
that EAS is not signiﬁcantly energizing the EAWs.

After several decades of work, there are many unan-
swered questions about SRBS. Simple estimates for the
onset and time-averaged reﬂectivity due to kinetic inﬂa-
tion are being investigated but are not yet established,
and the relative importance of the various saturation
mechanisms is still unclear. Research on EAWs and EAS,
besides its intrinsic physical interest, has value in under-
standing SRBS: light scattered oﬀ EAWs may indicate
when distribution functions are strongly modiﬁed. Al-
though large EAS reﬂectivity has yet to be observed, it
would not be the ﬁrst surprise in the rich physics of laser-
plasma interactions.

APPENDIX A: LINEAR MODES VIA
GAUSS-HERMITE PROJECTION

The Appendix presents how to ﬁnd the susceptibility
and linear modes for an arbitrary distribution by Gauss-
Hermite projection. We specialize to the 1-D electro-
static modes of an electron plasma with ﬁxed ions, and
choose units where ωp=λD=vT e = 1 for a reference n0
and Te. The linear susceptibility χ is

The Gauss-Hermite method has several advantages
over other approaches. Numerically performing the Lan-
dau integral for every vp of interest is time-consuming, re-
quires care in handling the Landau contour, and needs f
to be analytically continued oﬀ the real vp axis. Our tech-
nique only computes several integrals for the Fn’s, auto-
matically handles the Landau contour via the Z func-
tion, and is valid throughout the complex plane. Writ-
ing f as a series of Maxwellians involves some guesswork
since Maxwellians do not form an orthogonal basis. One
can use a diﬀerent scale for Hn and the exponential, for

involve oscillation on smaller velocity scales. When ex-
tended to complex u, these oscillations give rise to expo-
nential growth. The χu,n similarly blow up in the lower
half-plane (as is well-known for the Z function), with
growing with n for ﬁxed u below the real axis.

Very small-scale features in f project onto high-n basis
functions gn, which produce rapidly growing χu,n in the
complex plane and unphysically distort the modes. As
N increases for the parameters of Fig. 9, the roots vary
slightly and a single zero-contour of ǫ can bifurcate into
two. Low-pass ﬁltering before projection could mitigate
this. Although the Gauss-Hermite method gives much
insight into the linear dynamics of an arbitrary f , its use
requires caution and practice.

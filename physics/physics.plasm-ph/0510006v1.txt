Equation of state for partially ionized carbon at temperatures T & 105 K is calculated in a
wide range of densities, using the method of free energy minimization in the framework of the
chemical picture of plasmas. The free energy model includes the internal partition functions of
bound species. The latter are calculated by a self-consistent treatment of each ionization stage in the
plasma environment taking into account pressure ionization. The long-range Coulomb interactions
between ions and screening of the ions by free electrons are included using our previously published
analytical model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The understanding of the physical properties of mat-
ter at high densities and temperatures is important for
the fundamental physics as well as for various physical
and astrophysical applications. Since the 1980s the the-
oretical interest in matter under such unusual conditions
(e.g., Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4]) has been enhanced by labora-
tory developments like high-power short duration lasers,
shock-induced plasmas, inertial conﬁnement implosions,
or exploding metal wires (e.g., Refs. [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]). In the
astrophysical domain the calculation of the equation of
state (EOS) for stellar partial ionization zones is a par-
ticularly challenging problem.
In these zones the elec-
trons and diﬀerent ionic species cannot be regarded as
simple ideal gases: Coulomb interactions, bound-state
level shifts, pressure ionization, and electron degeneracy
should be taken into account. In this paper, we calculate
the EOS for carbon at temperatures 105 K . T . 107 K
in a wide range of densities ρ. Such an EOS is required,
e.g., for modeling inner envelopes of carbon-rich white
dwarfs [10, 11] or outer envelopes of neutron stars.

An EOS calculation in the partial ionization regime is
not possible without approximations. For astrophysical
simulations, these approximations should not violate the
thermodynamic consistency. The free energy minimiza-
tion method [12, 13] allows one to include the complex
physics in the model and ensures the consistency. This
method has the great advantage to identify the various
contributions to the free energy, illustrative of various
physical eﬀects (see, e.g., Ref. [14], for a discussion).

Free-energy models which carefully include the non-
ideal eﬀects have been proposed for ﬂuid hydrogen [15]
and helium [16, 17]; the EOS tables for these elements,

‡Electronic address: chabrier@ens-lyon.fr

which cover a pressure and temperature range appropri-
ate for low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and giant planets
have been calculated in [18]. For heavier elements, a
similarly detailed EOS is lacking. Up to now, the best
available thermodynamically consistent EOS for carbon
covering the stellar pressure ionization zones was the
EOS developed by Fontaine, Graboske, and Van Horn
in the 1970s [14] (FGV) and amended in 1990s [19].
We shall call these two versions FGV77 and FGV99,
respectively. This EOS has been calculated by diﬀer-
T domains. At relatively
ent methods in diﬀerent ρ
−
1) g cm−3 for 105 K
low densities (e.g., ρ < (0.01
< T < 106 K), the ionization equilibrium has been ob-
tained by the free-energy minimization technique. At
densities above several grams per cubic centimeter, the
Thomas-Fermi model has been employed. At interme-
diate densities, in particular in the various regimes of
pressure ionization, the EOS was interpolated between
these two regions. Clearly, the accuracy of the EOS
in the interpolation region can be called into question.
Moreover, the Thomas-Fermi model may be inaccurate
at ρ . 103 g cm−3, where the pressure is not suﬃciently
high to force the complete ionization of carbon, as we
shall see below.

−

Extension of the free energy minimization technique to
ρ & 0.1 g cm−3 is complicated because of the growing im-
portance of nonideal contributions to the free energy and
the onset of pressure ionization. The latter is diﬃcult
to treat in the framework of the “chemical picture” of
plasmas, which assumes that diﬀerent ion species can be
clearly identiﬁed (see, e.g., Refs. [18, 20, 21], for discus-
sion). On the other hand, EOS calculations within the
more rigorous “physical picture,” quite successful at rela-
tively low ρ (e.g., [22]), become prohibitively complicated
at such high densities. First principle approaches based
on path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) [23] or molecular
dynamics (MD) calculations are computationnaly highly
expensive. These methods also suﬀer from some diﬃ-
culties. Indeed, the sign or node problem for the PIMC
method or the use of eﬀective pair potentials for MD

simulations restrict their applicability (see however [2]).
In any case, a comparison with our results will be in-
structive, but, to the best of our knowledge, no PIMC or
MD data for carbon in the temperature-density range of
interest in this paper has been published yet.

In this paper we present an EOS model which relies
on the free energy minimization in the framework of the
chemical picture and extends to arbitrarily high densi-
ties across the pressure ionization region without inter-
polation. This allows us to obtain not only the thermo-
dynamic functions, but also number fractions for every
ionization stage. We treat the long-range interactions
in the system of charged particles (ions and electrons)
using the theory previously developed for fully ionized
plasmas [25, 26]. The contribution of the internal elec-
tronic structure of the ions embedded in the dense plasma
is calculated using a scheme [27] which self-consistently:
(i) builds separate models for diﬀerent ionization stages
in the plasma, taking into account the real structure of
bound states (conﬁgurations, LS terms); (ii) uses Boltz-
mann statistics to sum up the internal partition functions
of these ions; (iii) takes into account spreading of bound
states into energy bands as they are pressure ionized;
and (iv) treats quantum mechanically the free electron
background around each ion thus resolving resonances.
Points (i) and (ii) make our model diﬀerent from average
atom ones. The closest“ion-in-plasma” theoretical model
is that of Pain and Blenski [24], where ions are treated
separately (using superconﬁgurations), but screening is
introduced through a Thomas-Fermi approach for the
free electrons. The applicability of our model is tested
by numerical calculations of thermodynamic functions,
which we compare with the FGV models.

In Sec. II we present the free energy model. The tech-
nique for the calculation of thermodynamic functions at
equilibrium is described in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we discuss
the results of the EOS calculations for carbon plasma,
and in Sec. V we give conclusions.

II. FREE ENERGY MODEL

Consider a plasma consisting of Ne free electrons and
Ni heavy ions with numbers of bound electrons ν from
0 to Znuc (where Znuc is the element charge number)
in a volume V . Let us write the total Helmholtz free
energy as Ftot = Fe + Fi + Fex, where Fi,e denote
the ideal free energy of ions and free electrons, respec-
tively, and Fex is the excess (nonideal) part, which
arises from interactions. Fi
is the free energy of an
ideal Boltzmann gas mixture, which can be written
SmixT, where λi =
as Fi = NikBT
−
(2π~2/mikBT )1/2 is the thermal wavelength of the ions,
ν xν ln xν is the
mi is the ion mass, Smix =
entropy of mixing, and xν = Nν/Ni is the number frac-
P
ν xν = 1). For the
tion of the ions of the ν-th type (
electrons at arbitrary degeneracy, Fe can be expressed
through Fermi-Dirac integrals and approximated by an-

alytical formulae [25]. The main complication is the cal-
culation of the nonideal term, which is quite nontrivial
at high densities. It includes a contribution due to the
building of localized bound states of the ions, and the
long range Coulomb interactions between these ions and
free electrons. We write

Fex = Fee + Fii + Fie + Fint,

(1)

where the ﬁrst three terms represent the contributions of
electron-electron, ion-ion, and ion-electron interactions,
respectively, and Fint is the contribution due to the in-
ternal degrees of freedom of the ions, that involves sums
over bound states. Equation (1) does not imply a strict
separation of the terms on its right-hand side: No strict
deﬁnition of free and bound electrons nor ions exists in a
dense plasma. In general, the terms must be interdepen-
dent and evolve in a correlated way. Our approach to this
diﬃculty consists in calculating self-consistent models for
the ions embedded in the plasma, coupling them with a
model for the long range interaction, and minimizing the
resulting total free energy Ftot.

A. Free energy of a fully ionized plasma

A fully ionized electron-ion plasma which contains only
one ion species is characterized by three parameters: the
ion charge Ze, the electron density parameter rs, and the
ion Coulomb coupling parameter Γ:

rs =

ae
a0

,

Γ =

4π ne

(cid:18)

1/3 Z 5/3e2

(2)

where ne is the electron number density and a0 =
~2/mee2 is the Bohr radius. The Helmholtz free energy of
the fully ionized plasma is described by analytical ﬁtting
formulae [25, 26], which are applicable at high densities
(rs . 1, arbitrary Γ) or high temperatures (small Γ).
When neither rs nor Γ are small, the plasma cannot be
considered as fully ionized.

In a multicomponent fully ionized, dense plasma with
diﬀerent ion charges Zνe, the “linear mixing rule” has
been shown to be very accurate [28, 29, 30]:

ter for a multicomponent plasma is obtained by replacing

B. Bound-state contribution to the free energy

In order to evaluate Fint, we calculate the ionic struc-
ture in the plasma using the scheme described in [27]. It
is based on the ion-sphere approximation, which replaces
the actual plasma environment for every ion by the sta-
tistically averaged boundary conditions for the electron
wave functions within a spherical volume centered at the
ionic nucleus. At present we do not include neutral atoms
(ν = Znuc), which is justiﬁed at the temperatures and
densities where the ionization degree of the plasma is
high. For each ion containing ν bound electrons, a ra-
dius of the ion sphere Rν is determined self-consistently
from the requirement that the sphere is overall electri-
cally neutral. The Hamiltonian for the ion ν is written
as Hν =

i=1 hν(ri) + Wν , where

and (6) allows one to capture the plasma eﬀects in one-
electron energies and wave functions through Eq. (5),
while the ν-electron structure is retained through the
contribution Wν. The boundary condition at Rν for Eq.
(7) does not noticeably aﬀect Eνα except near the den-
sities where the corresponding term α becomes pressure-
ionized. The latter case will be addressed below.

neutralizing free electrons inside them, µe can be related
to the mean free electron density only after the global

populations of the ions.

ties, which are especially sharp at the lower temperature,
are the consequence of pressure ionization of separate lev-
els: when a nl level of ion ν crosses the continuum limit
and appears as a resonance in the neighboring ionization
state ν
1, the latter ion sphere shrinks to compensate
this increase in the free electron density of states.

e), the radius Rν decreases,
the wave functions ψν
nlm(r) become distorted, and the
energies ǫνnl spread into a band. We estimate a band
width by solving Eq. (7) with two alternative boundary
conditions: either ψν
nlm/∂r = 0 at
r = Rν. These two conditions give two energies which
we interpret as the upper (ǫ+) and lower (ǫ−) edges of
the band (Fig. 2). Eventually ǫ+ becomes positive. We
interpret the electrons with 0 < ǫ < ǫ+ as quasifree
and exclude them from the internal partition function
of the ion. We introduce an occupation probability wνnl,
equal to the statistical weight of electrons with ǫ < 0 (the
signiﬁcance and thermodynamic meaning of occupation
probabilities in the chemical picture of plasmas has been
discussed, e.g., in [20, 33, 34]). Assuming for the bands

C. Calculating thermodynamic functions

A. Equilibrium conditions

Thermodynamic equilibrium at constant V and T re-
alizes at the minimum of the Helmholtz free energy Ftot.
Since the total number of the ions in all ionization states
is ﬁxed, this minimum must be found under the con-
ν Nν = Ni. The charge neutrality condition
straint
is satisﬁed automatically, because the total number of
electrons equals Znuc in each ion cell by construction,
however at cost of the a priori unconstrained volume. In
order to maintain V = constant, one should impose the
condition

P

ν Nνvν = V .

These equilibrium conditions can be written as

the constraint GV = 1, we use the Lagrange multiplier

The solution provides the equilibrium values of Ftot, χe,
xν , and ne = ¯Zni.

At each value of λ, we approach min Φ in two stages:
ﬁrst, a rough position of the minimum is found by the
simplex method, and then it is reﬁned by the Powell’s
conjugate-direction procedure [36].
In order to ﬁlter-
out false local minima, the minimization procedure is re-
peated several times with diﬀerent initial sets of param-
eters, and the absolute minimum is selected. A search
for the root of the equation GV (λ) = 1 is performed
by bracketing and bisection, Because of the complicated
dependence of f and GV on the set of xν , and due to
the limited accuracy of minimization, GV (λ) may ex-
hibit a numerical discontinuity, which sometimes disal-
lows the bisection to converge, so we have tried several
initial guesses of λ in such cases.

and densities, all thermodynamic functions can be found
from its derivatives. The ﬁrst derivatives give the pres-

Although such calculation looks simple, it is techni-

by ﬁltering the calculated values. We performed calcula-
tions on a grid of (ρ, T ) points and evaluated the deriva-
tives at each (ρ, T ) point from using the least-squares ﬁt

In this case, the T -derivatives of

noise may preclude their evaluation. Fortunately, in this
regime these derivatives are mainly determined by f ﬁ.
We use the following modiﬁcation of Eq. (12a):

Xν

The values of f ′, xν , and ¯Z, and their ρ- and T -
derivatives are calculated numerically, as described
above, whereas f ﬁ and its derivatives are obtained from
the analytical ﬁts [25, 26].

The calculated functions CV , χT , and χρ still exhibit
a considerable numerical noise. To suppress it, we again
employ the least-squares ﬁltering.
Improved values of
pressure, consistent with the ﬁltered χT , are obtained
by numerical integration of the equation ln P =
χT dt,
starting from the lowest isotherm.

R

The thermodynamic stability (CV > 0, P > 0) and
normality (χT > 0) require that S/NikB monotonically
increases with decreasing ρ or increasing T . To maintain
these properties, we calculate S by integration of the
equations ∂S/∂V
|V = CV /T ,
|T = χT P/T and ∂S/∂T
starting from the highest ρ and lowest T .

Figures 3–5 show the T -dependences of ion number
fractions xν and the mean eﬀective charge ¯Z. At the
lower densities, the electrons are nondegenerate. In this
case, the mean ionization degree and ¯Z depend sensi-
tively on temperature. At the high density (Fig. 5), the
electron degeneracy is signiﬁcant, and the number of free
electrons is mainly controlled by pressure, rather than
temperature, so that ¯Z varies weakly. However, the state
of the bound electrons still depends appreciably on T :
most of them are in the 1s state at the higher T and in
the 1s2 state at the lower T .

The nonideality eﬀects are less important at lower den-
sity. Therefore, the abundance of individual ion species
at low densities can be evaluated from the Saha equation

tion and our calculations give identical results (this is one
of the checks of our calculations), but at ρ & 0.01 g cm−3,
Eq. (16) becomes progressively inaccurate (Fig. 4). The
diﬀerences between Saha and our models in Figs. 3 and
4 are due to the conﬁgurational eﬀects (i.e., the devia-
tions of the neutrality volumes from their ideal values; see
Fig. 1) and the Coulomb plasma nonideality (Sec. II A).
The ρ dependences of the ionization states at T =
106 K are shown in Fig. 6. They exhibit pronounced
maxima and minima due to the pressure ionization of
particular bound states in particular ionization stages.
These features are related to swelling and shrinking
of the individual neutrality volumes relative to their
rigid-background values (Fig. 1) and the corresponding
changes in the internal partition functions.

growing pressure of degenerate electrons. The diﬀerence
between our results and the FGV99 tables is in general
of the same magnitude as the diﬀerence between FGV77
and FGV99. However, our isotherms exhibit more fea-
tures. The slope of each isotherm varies near the den-
sities where the ion composition of the plasma rapidly
changes. These variations could not be revealed by the
Thomas-Fermi model, but are easily grasped within the
free-energy minimization technique. Related variations
are seen in Fig. 8, which shows isotherms of the internal

plasma at temperatures T & 105 K, which is relevant
for inner envelopes of the carbon-rich white dwarfs or
outer accreted envelopes of the neutron stars. For gen-
eral astrophysical applications of various type of stars, it
is desirable to extend the calculated EOS to other chem-
ical elements, ﬁrst of all to oxygen. We are planning to
perform such calculations in near future.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a model for calculation of the EOS
for dense, partially ionized plasmas, based on the free
energy minimization method and suitable for pressure
ionization zones. The free energy model is constructed
in the framework of the chemical picture of plasmas and
includes detailed self-consistent accounting of quantum
states of partially ionized atoms in the plasma environ-
ment. Occupation probability formalism based on the
energy bands is used to treat pressure ionization.

The developed technique is applied to the carbon

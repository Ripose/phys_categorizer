Abstract

We propose fractional Fokker-Planck equation for the kinetic description of
relaxation and superdiﬀusion processes in constant magnetic and random elec-
tric ﬁelds. We assume that the random electric ﬁeld acting on a test charged
particle is isotropic and possesses non-Gaussian Levy stable statistics. These
assumptions provide us with a straightforward possibility to consider formation
of anomalous stationary states and superdiﬀusion processes, both properties are
inherent to strongly non-equilibrium plasmas of solar systems and thermonuclear
devices. We solve fractional kinetic equations, study the properties of the solu-
tion, and compare analytical results with those of numerical simulation based
on the solution of the Langevin equations with the noise source having Levy
stable probability density. We found, in particular, that the stationary states
are essentially non-Maxwellian ones and, at the diﬀusion stage of relaxation, the
characteristic displacement of a particle grows superdiﬀusively with time and is
inversely proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

Anomalous random motions and related transport phenomena are ubiquitous in na-
ture. In these phenomena the laws of normal diﬀusion (ordinary Brownian motion)
are altered, e.g., the mean square no longer increases linearly in time, but instead
grows slower (sub-diﬀusion) or faster (super-diﬀusion) than the linear function. There
are a lot of examples from very diﬀerent ﬁelds of applications, see reviews [1], [2] and
references therein. The anomalous random motions often exhibit long-time and/or
space dependence as well as multi-scaling, or multifractal, behavior [3], [4]. These cir-
cumstances require to go beyond the theory of (relatively simple) random Markovian
processes as well as beyond the theory of (mono)fractal, or self-aﬃne, processes. The
systems, in which anomalous random motions occur are usually essentially non-linear
and, in this sense, the random motions are non-linear ones; this circumstance again
greatly complicates the problem of an adequate statistical description.

The two basic anomalous fractal random motions are of particular importance,
namely, fractional Brownian motion [5], and the Levy motion, whose theory has begun
from the works of P. Levy [6]. The former motion is characterized by long-range time
correlations, whereas the latter one is characterized by non-Gaussian statistics ; in
this case the increments of the process may be independent (Levy stable processes or
ordinary Levy motion [7]) or have an inﬁnite span of interdependence (fractional Levy
motion) [8], [9], [10] .

The theory of Levy stable distributions and stable processes naturally serves as
the basis for probabilistic description of the Levy motion, since stable distributions
obey Generalized Central Limit Theorem, thus generalizing Gaussian distribution [11].
However, the application of the theory of stable processes is limited because of the
inﬁniteness of the mean square and discontinuity of the sample paths. The ﬁnite
sample size and boundary eﬀects play a decisive role, thus modifying stable probability
laws (”truncated Levy distributions”) [12], and violating the property of self-aﬃnity
(”spurious multi-aﬃnity”)[13].

The peculiarity of anomalous random motions is that they cannot be described
by the standard Fokker-Planck equation because the basic assumptions, namely, the
Markov property and the local homogeneity of the space do not hold in these cases.
The use of diﬀerential equations with partial fractional derivatives is a perspective way
for describing such processes. One of the implementations of such an approach is the
use of diﬀerent forms of fractional kinetic Fokker-Planck equation or the corresponding
forms of the Master equation with fractional derivatives. Recently, kinetic equations
with fractional partial derivatives have attracted attention as a possible tool for the
description of diﬀusion and relaxation phenomena, see review [2] and references therein.
However, fractional calculus is far from being a regular tool in physics community,
and the solutions to fractional kinetic equations are known in a very few cases. The
development of the theory requires, from one hand, the development of microscopic
foundations of fractional kinetics and, from the other hand, the development of powerful
regular methods for solutions to fractional equations.

The various processes in space and thermonuclear plasmas could serve as impor-
tant applications of fractional kinetics. Indeed, many of the current challenges in solar
system plasmas as well as in plasmas of thermonuclear devices arise from the funda-
mentally multiscale and nonlinear nature of plasma ﬂuctuation and wave processes.
Anomalous diﬀusion and plasma heating, particle acceleration and macroscopic trans-

fer processes require to go beyond the ”traditional” plasma kinetic theory. Fractional
kinetics can be useful for describing such processes, just as it occurs in other ﬁelds
of applications. Our paper is a step in this direction. We consider the motion of a
charged Levy particle in a constant external magnetic ﬁeld and random electric ﬁeld
obeying non-Gaussian Levy statistics. Our problem is a natural generalization of the
classical example of the motion of a charged Brownian particle [14]. We solve the frac-
tional Fokker-Planck equation with fractional velocity derivative, study the relaxation
processes in phase and real spaces as well, and estimate fractional moments of energy
and coordinate. We also perform numerical modelling based on the numerical solution
to the Langevin equations and demonstrate qualitative agreement between analytical
and numerical results.

2 Fractional Fokker-Planck equation for charged par-

ticle in magnetic ﬁeld

The history of fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE) for the probability density
function (PDF) f (~r, ~v, t) in the phase space goes back to the papers by West and
Seshadri [15], and by Peseckis [16]. Here we recall brieﬂy the arguments used when
deriving FFPE. It is well known that usually the derivation of classical kinetic equations
for the Brownian motion is based on the assumption of the ﬁniteness of the second
moments of the PDF. This way is not useful here, because, as we shall see, the second
moments diverge. Thus, it is expedient to explore the method used by Chandrasekhar
[17] for the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion. His
method does not require the ﬁniteness of the second moments. In fact, for fractional
kinetics, the modiﬁcation of Chandrasekhar’s method was proposed for the ﬁrst time in
Ref. [16]. Here we proceed mainly along the derivation from Ref. [18]. We consider a
test charged particle with the mass m and the charge e, embedded in constant external
magnetic ﬁeld ~B and subjected to stochastic electric ﬁeld ~
(t) .We also assume, as
E
in the classical problem for the charged Brownian particle [14], that the particle is
νm~v, ν is the friction coeﬃcient. For this
inﬂuenced by the linear friction force
particle the Langevin equations of motion are

The statistical properties of the ﬁeld ~

(t)is homogenous and isotropic.

2. ~
(t) is a stationary white Levy noise.
E
The ﬁrst assumption is the usual one when dealing with the motion of charged
particle in a random electric ﬁeld. In subsequent Sections we consider two possibilities:
(t) is a 2-dimensional (d = 2) isotropic ﬁeld in the direction perpendicular to
external magnetic ﬁeld; in this case the motion along the magnetic ﬁeld is neglected,
and

(i) ~
E

(t) is a 3-dimensional (d = 3) ﬁeld.

(ii) ~
E
The second assumption has a profound meaning.
Indeed, if ~
E

(t) is a white Gaussian noise, then we encounter with a classical Brown-
ian problem and, by using Eqs. (2.1), we arrive at the Fokker-Planck equation and get,

as the consequences, Maxwell stationary PDF over the velocity, exponential relaxation
to the Maxwell PDF and the normal diﬀusion law for the particle motion in the real
space, as well. Instead, the non-Gaussian Levy statistics of the random force in the
Langevin equation (2.1) provides us with a simple and straightforward, at least, from
the methodical viewpoint, possibility to consider abnormal diﬀusion and non-Maxwell
stationary states, both properties are inherent to strongly non-equilibrium plasmas of
solar system and thermonuclear devices. Returning to Eq. (2.1), it follows from the
assumption 2 that the process, which is an integral of ~

a characteristic function of the Wiener process, and, after applying Chandrasekhar’s
procedure we arrive at the Fokker-Planck equation. But if α < 2 then, by applying
the procedure described in detail for the one-dimensional case in Ref.
[18], we arrive
at the fractional Fokker-Planck equation for the charged particle in the magnetic ﬁeld
and random electric ﬁeld:

Let us consider the case ~v0 = 0 for the sake of simplicity. The relaxation process,
whose characteristic function is given by Eq. (4.1), is not an α-stable process with
independent increments, since D~v is not a linear function of time, see Eq. (4.2). The
stable process arises asymptotically at small times only,

t << τ v = 1/αν,

(4.4)

when the exponent in Eq.
(4.2) can be expanded into power series. On the other
hand, after exponential relaxation to the stationary state, that is, at t >> τ v the
stochastic process ~v (t) becomes asymptotically stationary process with the stable PDF

We also note that stationary PDF does not depend on the magnetic ﬁeld.

Another interesting point is related to stationary solutions of fractional kinetic
equations. In the theory of Brownian motion equilibrium Maxwell PDF over velocity is
reached at t >> 1/ν. It is characterized by the temperature T of surrounding medium.
The following relation exists between the parameter D and the friction coeﬃcient ν :

where kB is the Boltzmann constant. The temperature T is a measure of a mean kinetic
energy of the Brownian particle:

Equations (4.6) and (4.7) are examples of ﬂuctuation-dissipation relations. For this
case the source in the Langevin equation is called the source of internal ﬂuctuations.
Relations (4.6) and (4.7) may not be fulﬁlled, as it takes place, e.g., in auto-oscillation
systems [20]. In such a case one says that there is the source of external (relatively to
the system considered) ﬂuctuations in Eq. (2.2). However, Maxwell exponential form
of stationary solutions retains. As to the Levy motion, the ﬂuctuation - dissipation
=
relations can not be fulﬁlled, at least, because of the inﬁnity of square velocity:
for 0 < α < 2. Therefore, we can only say about the Langevin source as about

v2

the source of external ﬂuctuations. Moreover, the stationary solutions do not possess
Maxwell form but instead more general form of stable distributions. We also note that
at present there is no theory of equilibrium state basing on stable PDFs.

We further study energy distribution in the stationary state,

We recall, that the two possibilities can be considered, namely, (i) the random
electric ﬁeld is isotropic in the plane perpendicular to the external magnetic ﬁeld, and
(ii) the ﬁeld is isotropic in the three-dimensional space. In the former case ~k and ~v
are two-dimensional vectors in Eq. (4.8), d = 2, whereas in the latter case ~k and ~v are
three-dimensional vectors, d = 3. We consider both cases. After some transforms we

We carry out numerical simulation based on the solution of the Langevin equations
(2.1) with a two-dimensional isotropic white Levy noise ~
(t). The case of a strong
E
magnetic ﬁeld is simulated. In Fig. 1 typical dependencies E (t) (t is a discrete time,
∆t = 10−3 is a time step) are shown on the left for a) α = 1.95 and c) α = 1.1.
With Levy index decreasing the ”jumps” on the trajectories, or ”Levy ﬂights”, become
larger; this eﬀect is due to the power law tails of the PDF of the white Levy noise in
the Langevin equation. In this Figure and below, in Figs. 2 - 4, the parameters used
in simulation are Ω = 2, ν = 0.07, and D = 1. At the right, Figs. b) and d), the ”Levy
ﬂights” are shown on the (vx, vy) plane. Again, large ”jumps” are clearly seen in the
bottom ﬁgure.

In Fig. 2 the stationary PDFs fst (E) are shown for a two-dimensional problem at
the left, Figs. a), c) and for a three-dimensional problem at the right, Figs. b), d),
respectively. At the top, in Fig. a), b), the linear scale is used, whereas in the bottom,
in Figs. c), d), the PDFs are shown in the log-log scale.

The PDFs estimated according to Eqs. (4.9) for the Levy index α = 1.1 are depicted
(4.10) for α = 2.0
by solid lines, whereas the PDFs estimated according to Eqs.
(Brownian motion) are depicted by dotted lines. The bottom ﬁgures clearly show the
power asymptotics of the PDFs. The black points on the left ﬁgures indicate the PDF
obtained in numerical simulation of a two-dimensional problem, the parameters used
in numerical simulation are the same as in Fig. 1. The quantitative agreement between
analytical and numerical results is obvious.

In Fig. 3, as the result of numerical solution of the Langevin equations, the moments
of the energy are shown for the Levy index α = 1.6 and for diﬀerent orders q, see

Eq

i

from the bottom to the top: q = 0.12, which is less than α/2, q = 0.8, which is equal
α/2, and q = 2.0, which is greater than α/2. The stationary level of the q-th moment,
estimated according to Eq. (4.13b) is indicated by dotted line in the bottom ﬁgure. It
is seen that, with q increasing, the moments of the energy strongly ﬂuctuate; this is
the numerical manifestation of the fact that these moments diverge at q

α/2.

5 Non-Homogeneous Relaxation and Superdiﬀusion

We turn to the relaxation in non-homogeneous case. Since general analysis of Eqs.
(3.5)-(3.8) is rather complicated and taking in mind that we already have information
about velocity relaxation, we study evolution of a simpler PDF instead of f (~r, ~v, t),
namely,

One can introduce ”the typical displacement” of a particle deﬁned as

From Eq. (5.15) it follows that at any q (not only at q = 2) we have for the Brownian
particle,

with the prefactor which, of course, depends on q. We recall that usually just t and
(especially in plasma physics) B-dependences serve as indicator of normal or anoma-
lous diﬀusion. Therefore, we can use the typical displacement (5.18) as a measure of
anomalous diﬀusion rate at 0 < α < 2 and any q < α. Indeed, it follows from Eq.
(5.13) that for the anomalous diﬀusion

Expression (5.20) teaches us that in our model diﬀusion is anomalously fast over t ,
since α < 2 ; this diﬀusion is also called superdiﬀusion. At the same time it retains
classical scaling over B ( that is, given by Eqs. (5.17) or (5.19)). We also note that

Basing on the numerical solution to the Langevin equations (2.1) we estimated
numerically the moments Mr (t; q, α) by averaging over 100 realizations, each consisting

displacement ∆r) is shown versus t in a log-log scale for the three values of q, and
for the Levy index equal 1.2, see from bottom to top: q = 0.12, which is less than
α, q = 1.1 which is nearly α, and q = 2.0 (variance), which is greater than α. The
dashed lines have the slope 1/α, which is, in fact, the theoretical value of the diﬀusion
exponent at q < α, see Eq. (5.20). At q < α the numerical curve is well ﬁtted by the

In our numerical simulation the scaling given by Eq. (5.20) was also checked in
more detail. The results are presented in Fig. 5. At the left, in Figure a), we show the
1/B - dependence of the characteristic displacement ∆r. The Levy index α is equal
1.2, and q is equal 0.12. The values of ∆r obtained in numerical simulation are shown
by black points, which are well ﬁtted by straight dotted line. This fact conﬁrms that
∆r is inversely proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld. At the right in Figure b) we show
tµ versus 1/α. The black points indicate the result

6 Conclusion

In this paper we propose fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE) for the description
of the motion of a charged particle in constant magnetic ﬁeld and stochastic electric
ﬁelds. The latter is assumed to be a white Levy noise. We also assume that the particle
is inﬂuenced by a linear friction force. Such formulation is a natural generalization of
the classical problem for the Brownian particle [14].
It allows us to consider in a
simplest way the peculiarities of the motion stipulated by non-Gaussian Levy statistics
of a random electric ﬁeld.

The main results are as follows:
1. The general solution to FFPE for a charged particle in constant magnetic ﬁeld
is obtained. In case of the absence of magnetic ﬁeld this solution lead to the results
obtained previously. However, the general solution also allows us to study the opposite
case of a strong magnetic ﬁeld in detail.

2. The properties of stationary states are studied for two- and three-dimensional
motions. The velocity relaxation is studied in detail, and non-Maxwellian stationary
states are found, for which the velocity PDF is a Levy stable distribution.

The energy PDFs are obtained, which have power law tails. This circumstance
leads to divergence of the energy mean. In the real experiments as well as in numerical
simulation the divergence manifests itself in large ﬂuctuations of the mean value with
time.

3. The superdiﬀusion of a charged particle across magnetic ﬁeld is studied within
the framework of FFPE. The fractional moments of space displacement are estimated,
t1/α,
and anomalous dependence of characteristic displacement ∆r versus time, ∆r
α < 2 , is found. The typical displacement is inversely proportional to the magnetic

∼

ﬁeld. Therefore the diﬀusion described by our FFPE demonstrate anomalous behavior
with time and remains classical with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld dependence.

4. We carry out numerical simulation based on the solution to the Langevin equa-
tions for a charged particle in constant magnetic and random electric ﬁelds. We study
numerically the process of relaxation and stationary energy states for diﬀerent Levy
indexes as well as superdiﬀusion process. The results of numerical simulation are in
qualitative agreement with analytical estimates.

In summary, we believe that fractional kinetics will be a useful complementary tool
for understanding and description of variety of non-equilibrium phenomena in space
and thermonuclear plasmas. More elaborated fractional kinetic equations based on
more sophisticated Langevin equations can be constructed, which, in particular, lead
to a ﬁnite variance of the displacement of a particle and to anomalous B - dependence.
On the other hand, a consistent development of the theory of essentially non-Gaussian
plasma ﬂuctuations is also of interest.

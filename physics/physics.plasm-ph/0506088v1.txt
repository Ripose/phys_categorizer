We present direct numerical simulations and Lagrangian averaged (also known as α-model) simulations of
forced and free decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in two dimensions. The statistics of sign cancel-
lations of the current at small scales is studied using both the cancellation exponent and the fractal dimension
of the structures. The α-model is found to have the same scaling behavior between positive and negative con-
tributions as the direct numerical simulations. The α model is also able to reproduce the time evolution of
these quantities in free decaying turbulence. At large Reynolds numbers, an independence of the cancellation
exponent with the Reynolds numbers is observed.

The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation is of-
ten used to model plasmas or conducting ﬂuids in astrophys-
ical and geophysical environments. However, given the huge
amount of temporal and spatial scales involved in the dynam-
ics of these objects, simulations are always carried out in a
region of parameter space far from the observed values. La-
grangian averaged magnetohydrodynamics (LAMHD), also
called the MHD alpha-model [1, 2, 3, 4] (or the Camassa-
Holm equations in early papers studying the hydrodynamic
case [5]), has been recently introduced as a way to reduce
the number of degrees of freedom of the system, while keep-
ing accurate evolution for the large scales. This approach (as
well as large eddy simulations, or LES, for MHD; see e.g.
[6]) is intended to model astrophysical or geophysical ﬂows
at high Reynolds numbers using available computational re-
sources. Several aspects of the MHD alpha-model have al-
ready been tested in two and three dimensions at moderate
Reynolds numbers, against direct numerical simulations of the
MHD equations [3, 4]. These studies were focused on com-
parisons of the evolution of global quantities and the dynamics
of the large scale components of the energy spectrum [3, 4, 7].
All these models introduce changes in the small scale dy-
namics in order to preserve the evolution of the large scales in
the system. In several cases, it is of interest to know the statis-
tics of the small scales. It is also important to model properly
the small scales because they have an effect on large scales,
as for example in the case of eddy noise: the beating of two
small scales eddies produces energy at the large scale, and this
may affect the global long-time evolution of the ﬂow, an issue
that arises in global climate evolution or in solar-terrestrial in-
teractions. Moreover, plasmas and conducting ﬂuids generate
thin and intense current sheets where magnetic reconnection
takes place. In these regions, the magnetic ﬁeld and the cur-
rent rapidly change sign, and after reconnection the magnetic
energy is turned into mechanical and thermal energy. These
events are known to take place in the magnetopause [8], the
magnetotail [9], the solar atmosphere [10], and the interplan-
etary medium [11].

Current sheets are strongly localized and intermittent. To
preserve reliable statistics of these events in models of MHD
turbulence is of utmost importance to model some of these as-
trophysical and geophysical problems. In this work, we study

whether the MHD alpha-model is able to reproduce the statis-
tics and scaling observed in these phenomena.

In order to measure fast oscillations in sign of a ﬁeld on ar-
bitrary small scales, the cancellation exponent was introduced
[12, 13, 14]. The exponent is a measure of sign-singularity.
We can deﬁne the signed measure for the current jz(x) on a
set Q(L) of size L as

µi(l) =

dx jz(x)

ZQi(l)

(cid:30) ZQ(L)

dx |jz(x)|

(1)

where {Qi(l)} ⊂ Q(L) is a hierarchy of disjoint subsets of
size l covering Q(L). The partition function χ measures the
cancellations at a given lengthscale l,

and we can study the scaling behaviors of the cancellations
deﬁning the cancellation exponent κ, where

χ(l) =

|µi(l)|,

XQi(l)

χ(l) ∼ l

−κ.

(2)

(3)

Note that positive κ indicates fast changes in sign on small
scales (in practice, a cut-off is always present at the dissipation
scale). A totally smooth ﬁeld has κ = 0. This exponent can
also be related with the fractal dimension D of the turbulent
structures [14],

κ = (d − D)/2,

(4)

where d is the number of spatial dimensions of the system. In
some circumstances, we will also be interested on the cancel-
lation exponent for the vorticity ωz. In that case the vorticity
replaces the current in the deﬁnition of the signed measure
µi(l) [Eq. (1)].

Under special assumptions, relations between the cancella-
tion exponent and scaling exponents have also been derived
[13]. Positive cancellation exponent κ has been found in
plasma experiments [12], direct simulations of MHD turbu-
lence [14], in situ solar wind observations [15], and solar pho-
tospheric active regions [16], where changes in the scaling
were identiﬁed as preludes to ﬂares.

In this work we will consider both free decaying and forced
simulations of incompressible MHD and LAMHD turbulence
in two dimensions (2D). The MHD equations in 2D can be
written in terms of the stream function Ψ and the z component
of the vector potential Az,

∂t∇2Ψ = [Ψ, ∇2Ψ] − [Az, ∇2Az] + ν∇4Ψ

∂tAz = [Ψ, Az] + η∇2Az,

(5)
(6)

where the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld are given by v =
∇ × (Ψˆz) and B = ∇ × (Az ˆz) respectively, and [F, G] =
∂xF ∂yG − ∂xG∂yF is the standard Poisson bracket. The
LAMHD equations are obtained by introducing a smooth-
ing length α, and the relation between smoothed (denoted
by a subindex s) and unsmoothed ﬁelds is given by F =
(1 − α2∇2)Fs, for any ﬁeld F. The system of LAMHD equa-
tions in this geometry [3] is

∂t∇2Ψ = [Ψs, ∇2Ψ] − [Asz , ∇2Az] + ν∇4Ψ (7)
∂tAsz = [Ψs, Asz ] + η∇2Az.
(8)

For both systems of equations, the current is given by jz =
−∇2Az, and the vorticity by ωz = −∇2Ψ. Equations (5-8)
are solved in a periodic box using a pseudospectral code as de-
scribed in [3]. The code implements the 2/3-rule for dealias-
ing, and the maximum wavenumber resolved is kmax = N/3,
where N is the linear resolution used in the simulation. All
the ﬁelds are written in dimensionless units.

To characterize the oscillating behavior and sign singular-
ities in the ﬂows obtained from the MHD and LAMHD sim-
ulations, we perform a signed measure analysis and compute
the cancellation exponent κ for the current and for the vor-
(3), its value is obtained by ﬁtting
ticity. Following Eq.
χ(l) = c(l/L)−κ through the inertial range, where L = 2π
is the length of the box, and c is a constant. The lengthscales
in the inertial range used for this ﬁt are obtained studying the
scaling of the third order structure function [17].

We ﬁrst present results for a forced MHD simulation with
10242 grid points, with η = ν = 1.6 × 10−4. Both the mo-
mentum and the vector potential equations were forced. The
external forces had random phases in the Fourier ring between
k = 1 and k = 2, and a correlation time of ∆t = 5 × 10−2.
The system was evolved in time until reaching a turbulent
steady state. The amplitude of the magnetic force averaged
over space was held constant to 0.2, and the amplitude of the
mechanical force to 0.45, in order to have the system close
to equipartition in the saturated state. Two more simulations
using the LAMHD system were carried, with the same pa-
rameters as the MHD run but with resolutions of 5122 grid
points and α ≈ 0.0117, and 2562 grid points and α ≈ 0.0234
respectively. The Kolmogorov’s kinetic and magnetic dissipa-
tion wavenumbers in the MHD run are kν ≈ kη ≈ 332, and
in all the LAMHD simulations these wavenumbers are larger
than the largest resolved wavenumber kmax, by virtue of the
model. Note that although it is common to reduce the spatial
resolution even more in studies of the large scale components
of the energy spectrum in LES of hydrodynamic turbulence,
this cannot be done in this context since larger amounts of

statistics are needed to properly compute the cancellation ex-
ponent (see e.g. [18] for a study of intermittency in LES).

Fig. 1 shows χ(l) for the three simulations, averaged us-
ing 11 snapshots of the current covering a total time span of
20 turnover times in the turbulent steady state. A power law
can be identiﬁed at intermediate scales, scales smaller than
the forcing band but larger than the dissipation scale. Note
that the two LAMHD simulations reproduce the same scaling
as the MHD simulation. As a result, the sign singularity and
fractal structure are both well captured in the inertial range al-
though the alpha-model is known to give thicker structures at
scales smaller than α due to the introduction of the smoothing
length [4, 19]. The best ﬁt for the current jz using a power law
in the inertial range gives κ = 0.51±0.07 for the 10242 MHD
run, κ = 0.60 ± 0.08 for the 5122 LAMHD simulation, and
κ = 0.60 ± 0.10 for the 2562 LAMHD simulation. Note that a
value of κ = 0.51 in the MHD simulation gives a value of the
fractal dimension D = 0.98 ± 0.14, close to the codimension
of 1 corresponding to current sheets in MHD turbulence. For
the vorticity, the cancellation exponent is κ = 0.81 ± 0.15 for
the 10242 MHD run, κ = 0.89 ± 0.11 for the 5122 LAMHD
simulation, and κ = 0.85 ± 0.10 for the 2562 LAMHD sim-
ulation, giving a fractal dimension of D = 0.38 in the MHD
simulation. The values obtained are compatible with the val-
ues of κ = 0.43 ± 0.06 and D = 1.14 ± 0.12 for the current,
and κ = 0.69 ± 0.12 and D = 0.62 ± 0.24 for the vortic-
ity obtained in Ref. [14] for forced direct numerical simula-
tions of 2D MHD turbulence using a 10242 spatial grid and
η = ν = 8 × 10−4. Given the good agreement between MHD
and LAMHD simulations, in the following we will only refer
to the cancellation exponent for the current density.

Fig. 2.a shows the corresponding results for free decay-
ing MHD turbulence. Three simulations are shown, one
MHD run using 20482 grid points, a 10242 LAMHD run with
α ≈ 0.0058, and a 5122 LAMHD run with α ≈ 0.0117. The
three simulations were started with the same initial conditions;

also captures the time evolution of the cancellation exponent
in free decaying turbulence, as well as the fractal structure of
the problem as time evolves.

As previously noted in [3], the alpha-model slightly over-
estimates the magnetic dissipation. Note however that in the
three simulations the peak of magnetic dissipation takes place
close to t ≈ 6, just before the peak of the cancellation expo-
nent κ. From the maximum energy dissipation rate, the Kol-
mogorov’s dissipation wavenumber for the kinetic and mag-
netic energy at t ≈ 6 are estimated as kν ≈ kη ≈ 470, and
this is again larger than the largest wavenumbers resolved in
the two LAMHD simulations.

The observed slow decay of the cancellation exponent
(compared with the square current) is related to the persistence
of strong current sheets in the system for long times, even af-
ter the peak of magnetic dissipation is reached. The system,
instead of evolving fast to a smooth solution at every point in
space, keeps dissipating energy in a few thin localized struc-
tures. The existence of these current sheets at late times can
be more easily veriﬁed in simulations with smaller viscosity
ν and diffusivity η. While in the peak of magnetic dissipation
the system is permeated by a large number of small current
sheets, at late times only a few current sheets are observed
isolated by large regions where the ﬁelds are approximately
smooth.

Given the good agreement between direct numerical simu-
lations (DNS) and LAMHD as seen in the preceding ﬁgure,
we can reliably explore with the model Reynolds numbers
unattainable in a reasonable time with DNS. In this context,
we show that the maximum values of κ obtained in the simu-
lations seem to be insensitive to the Reynolds numbers within
a given method (MHD or LAMHD) once a turbulent state is
reached. As an example, in Fig. 3 we give the time history
of the cancellation exponent and the square current for a free
decaying LAMHD simulation with η = ν = 2 × 10−5 up to
t = 20. The initial conditions are the same as in the previously
discussed simulations, and α ≈ 0.0033. It is worth noting that
the time evolution of the magnetic dissipation in both decay-
ing runs (Figs. 2.b and 3) conﬁrm previous results at lower

tween k = 1 and k = 3 in Fourier space, and unit r.m.s.
values. The kinematic viscosity and magnetic diffusivity used
were ν = η = 10−4. The three simulations were evolved in
time without external forces.

The evolution of the cancellation exponent as a function of
time in the free decaying simulations is shown in Fig. 2.b. For
these simulations, the cancellation exponent is computed be-
tween the lengthscales L/l ≈ 1/24 and L/l ≈ 1/73, where a
power law scaling in χ(l) can be clearly identiﬁed at all times
up to t = 10. At t = 0 the cancellation exponent κ is close
to zero, which corresponds to the smooth initial conditions.
As time evolves, κ grows up to 0.75 at t ≈ 8, as the system
evolves from the initially smooth ﬁelds to a turbulent state
with strong and localized current sheets. After this maximum,
the exponent κ decays slowly in time. The maximum of κ
takes place slightly later than the maximum of magnetic dissi-
pation, as is also shown in Fig. 2.b. Note that the alpha-model

4

lence are related with intermittency and anomalous scaling
of structure functions [13], inherently associated with the dy-
namics of the small scales, and as a result harder to model
in truncations or closures of the MHD equations. For exam-
ple, two-point closures of turbulence behave smoothly (they
also have no information about physical structures since they
deal only with energy spectra). The intermittency of LES is
an open topic, in particular because for neutral ﬂuids the need
to study the three dimensional case implied until recently that
only low-resolution studies could be accomplished for which
intermittent structures were barely resolved (see [22] for a
recent study). From that point of view, the present study
in two dimensions allows for higher Reynolds number stud-
ies. In MHD turbulence, the energy cascade being to small
scales both in two and three space dimensions, it is hoped
that the information gained here will carry on to the three-
dimensional case. The new result stemming from this study
is that the LAMHD alpha-model, although it alters the small
scales through ﬁltering, it nevertheless preserves some statisti-
cal information concerning the small scales. It is able to repro-
duce the scaling observed in forced MHD turbulence, as well
as the time evolution of the cancellation exponent in free de-
caying simulations and as such, it represents a valuable model
for studies of MHD ﬂows for example at low magnetic Prandtl
number ν/η as encountered in the liquid core of the Earth or
in the solar convection zone (see e.g., [7]).

Reynolds numbers [20, 21]: namely that the peak dissipation
(t ∼ 7) is lower for higher Reynolds numbers, while for later
times it is quite independent of the Reynolds values.

Fig. 4 shows χ(l) for early and late times in the same sim-
ulation. At small scales, the slope of χ always goes to zero, as
can be expected since close to the dissipation lengthscale the
ﬁelds are expected to be smooth. However, note that as time
evolves the scaling of χ with l drifts to smaller scales, and at
t = 20 a clear scaling can be observed up to l/L ≈ 0.005,
while at the large scales χ displays fast oscillations with a
mean slope close to zero.

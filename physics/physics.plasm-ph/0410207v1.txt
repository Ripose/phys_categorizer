Potential of a moving test charge in a dusty plasma in the

presence of grain size distribution and grain charging dynamics

Abstract

It is well known that the form of grain size distribution strongly inﬂuences the lin-

ear dielectric response of a dusty plasma. In previous results [IEEE Trans. Plasma

Sci. 29, 182 (2001)], it was shown that for a class of size distributions, there is

an equivalence to a Lorentzian distribution of mono-sized particles. The electro-

static response to a slowly moving test charge, using a second order approximation

can then be found [Phys. Lett. A 305, 79 (2002)].

It is also well known [Phys.

Plasmas 10, 3484 (2003)] that the dynamical charging of grains in a dusty plasma

enhances the shielding of a test charge. It seems natural at this stage to seek the

combined eﬀects of grain size distribution and grain charging dynamics to a test

charge moving through the dusty plasma. Here we consider the eﬀects of both grain

size distribution and dynamical grain charging to a test charge moving slowly in

a dusty plasma by expressing the plasma dielectric response as a function of both

grain size distribution and grain charging dynamics. Both analytical as well as the

numerical results are presented. It is interesting to note that the previous results

can be retrieved by choosing appropriate values for diﬀerent parameters. This kind

of study is relevant for both laboratory and space plasmas.

1 Introduction

There is currently considerable interest in understanding the physics of dusty plasmas

which in addition to the electrons and ions, also contain a dust component. The dust

grains become charged due to the collection of ions and electrons from the plasma and can

typically acquire thousands of electron charges (due to high mobility of electrons, dust

grains usually becomes negatively charged). Moreover, the dust charge does not necessar-

ily remain constant and may continuously ﬂuctuate due to varying plasma currents that

ﬂow onto the dust charge surface. The currents reaching the dust grain surface depend

on the ambient plasma conditions and the ﬂoating potential of the dust particle. In this

way the dust charge becomes a dynamic variable and ﬂuctuates about an equilibrium

charge state. In order to deal with the problem of charging dynamics, many papers have

taken into account this dynamics and presented their results [1, 2, 3], the consequences

of including a dust component have lead to a renewed interest in the problem of the test

charge response. This is important for understanding the inﬂuence of a dust component

on the interaction between charged particles. An important consequence of the potential

excited by a moving charge is the energy loss and braking of the velocity due to the

resultant electric ﬁeld at the moving charge [4, 5].

We have investigated the response of a slowly moving test charge in a dusty plasma

in the presence of charging dynamics [6, 7] and found that the dynamical charging of

dust grains in a dusty plasma enhances the shielding of the test charge. The response

potential up to the second order in test charge velocity was found and expressed analyti-

cally in terms of strength functions. A delayed shielding eﬀect due to dynamical charging

was also reported. The linearised dielectric theory was used and the equilibrium dust

distribution was considered to be Maxwellian. Furthermore, the equilibrium dust parti-

cles were assumed to be similar and all the dust particles were treated as point particles.

But this is not always true and in general, a size distribution of dust grains is to be

expected both in artiﬁcial and natural plasmas [8, 9], for a Maxwellian distribution and

a special class of physically reasonable size distributions, the dielectric response function

was shown to be equivalent to that for monosized particles with a generalised Lorentzian

2

or kappa distribution [10] Recently, we have taken into account the test charge response

of a dusty plasma with a grain size distribution [11, 12] and have shown that the form

of grain size distribution strongly inﬂuences the linear dielectric response of a test charge

in a dusty plasma. The analytical expressions for the response potential, using a second

order approximation were found and the eﬀects of collisions also investigated. More re-

cently, A. M. Mirza et al.

[13] extended this work further and presented analytical as

well as numerical results for the slowing down of a pair of test charge projectiles moving

through a multicomponent dust-contaminated plasma. In their analyses, they found that

the energy loss for the Maxwellian distribution is larger compared to that for generalised

Lorentzian distribution. They also found that for smaller values of the spectral index κ,

the test charge projectile gains instead of losing energy.

In this paper, we have extended our previous work on grain size distribution [12] by

taking into account the eﬀect of charging dynamics and present analytical as well as

numerical results for the response potential for a test charge moving through a multicom-

ponent dusty plasma.

2 Plasma Dielectric for a Dusty Plasma

The linear response of the dusty plasma for an electrostatic disturbance can be determined

through the choice of the plasma dielectric function. Here the dielectric will include a

term for the dynamical charging of the dust grains and the eﬀect of a speciﬁc choice for

the size distribution will be taken into account.

2.1 Grain Size Distribution

Here we choose the size distribution h(a) used previously [10].

h(a)da = h0aβ exp

α3a3

da

−

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(1)

where the constant h0 is deﬁned by setting the integrated density to the dust density
nd (h0 = 3ndαβ+1/Γ((β + 1)/3)). The distribution h(a) has a maximum at a = a0 ≡
(β/3)1/3α−1. If we let α
α3 the distribution h(a) tends to a delta function

with β

→ ∞

∼

3

at a = a0 i.e. a monosized distribution with dust grain radius a0. This limit is useful for

comparing the general results that will be found here with earlier results for monosized

distributions. The distribution h(a) can also be transformed to a distribution over grain

mass m so that,

h(a)da = w(m)dm

w0m(β−2)/3 exp (

µm) dm

≡

−

(2)

For small sizes h(a) has an approximate power law dependence on the size a. A power law

dependence is a simple ﬁrst approximation if the actual size distribution is not known.

For large masses w(m) is dominated by an exponential decrease with mass (for β = 2 the

dependence is purely exponential, as assumed in early work on interstellar dust grains).

These properties motivated this particular choice of size distribution [10]. Without charg-

ing dynamics this choice for h(a) leads to a dielectric response equivalent to a kappa

distribution [10] with κ = (2β + 5)/6.

(For the purely exponential mass dependence,

β = 2, the index κ = 3/2.)

2.2 Charging Dynamics

Here we now include charging dynamics with frequencies ν0 ≡
Ωu0 and Ωv0 (deﬁned by
Melandsø et al [15]) that depend on grain size a. This leads to a response term with an

integration over grain size with a diﬀerential “charging wavenumber” Hdch given by

H 2

dch (a) da

≡

4π

ah (a) da

Ωv0
Ωu0

where Ωu0 and Ωv0 are the frequencies introduced by Melandsø et al [15] in the linearized

equation for the grain charge perturbation qd1 with a plasma potential perturbation φ1,

∂qd1
∂t

=

Ωu0qd1 −
−

4πε0aΩv0φ1

(3)

In this equation Ωu0 ≡
scale for the grain charge to come into equilibrium with the undisturbed plasma. The

ν0(a) is the grain charge relaxation rate i.e. τ0 ≡

1/ν0 is the time

total charging wave number Kdch may then be deﬁned by

K 2

dch ≡

For a monosize distribution h(a) is a delta function and the above expression reduces to

the standard deﬁnition [7]. Integrating for h(a) given by the equation (1) gives for Hdch

Following the analysis of Melandsø et al [15], for a standard model of the dust charging

where, assuming equal ion and electron temperatures, the numerical constants are δv0 =

2.793 and δu0 = 1.795. Here we note that, for grain sizes comparable to the electron

Debye length λDe, these frequencies are of the order of the ion plasma frequency ωpi.

The frequencies Ωv0 and Ωu0 ≡
ratio δ0 ≡
equation (5) can now be written using these expressions and the size distribution h(a)

Ωv0/Ωu0 = δv0/δu0 = 1.556 is independent of the dust size. The last term in

ν0 are simply proportional to the dust size a and the

deﬁned by equation (1). There is no obvious simple analytical expression for the resulting

5

integration, but for a slowly moving test charge the integral can be expanded as a power

series in Vt. The individual terms can then be integrated in terms of the gamma function.

3 Response to a Moving Test Charge

For a test charge response in a plasma, the general expression for the electrostatic potential

is given by [14]

where Vt is the test charge velocity and D(K, ω) is the plasma dispersion function. The

explicit form of D(K, ω) depends on the physics of the dusty plasma. Here D(K, ω) is

chosen to include the eﬀects of a grain size distribution and charging dynamics.

For a slowly moving test charge (Vt < Vtd), we can expand the plasma dispersion

function (equation (6)) up to ﬁrst order and hence rewrite equation (5) for the dielectric

up to second order in test charge velocity as

It is to be noted that φ1 is the same as we found earlier [12] except for the deﬁnition

(cid:16)

of Kef f which now includes the eﬀect from charging dynamics in terms of K1, while φch

is the contribution which comes explicitly from the dust charging dynamics. The reader

is referred to [12] for the results of equation (11) for φ1, while in the following we shall

present the results for φch. The above equation (12) can be written in terms of strength

(from equation (8) where Ωu0 ≡
a dust grain with radius α−1 to reach equilibrium with the ambient plasma, and Vtτ is the

ν0). Therefore τ is the relaxation time for the charge on

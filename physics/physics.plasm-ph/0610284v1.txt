Abstract

Nonlinear interactions involving electrostatic upper-hybrid (UH),

ion-cyclotron (IC),

lower-

hybrid (LH), and Alfv´en waves in quantum magnetoplasmas are considered. For this purpose,

the quantum hydrodynamical equations are used to derive the governing equations for nonlinearly

coupled UH, IC, LH, and Alfv´en waves. The equations are then Fourier analyzed to obtain nonlin-

ear dispersion relations, which admit both decay and modulational instabilities of the UH waves

at quantum scales. The growth rates of the instabilities are presented. They can be useful in

applications of our work to diagnostics in laboratory and astrophysical settings.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum plasma physics is a new and rapidly emerging subﬁeld of plasma physics. It

has received a great deal of attention due to its wide range of applications [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Quantum plasmas can be composed of the electrons, positrons, holes, and ions. They are

characterized by low temperatures and high particle number densities. Quantum plasmas

and collective eﬀects play an important role in microelectronic components [1], dense as-

trophysical systems (in particular white dwarf and neutron star environments) [2], intense

laser-matter experiments [3], and nonlinear quantum optics [4, 5]. It is well known that when

the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the charged particles is equal to or larger than the
average inter-particle distance d = n−1/3, where n is a typical plasma density, the quantum

mechanical eﬀects play a signiﬁcant role in the behaviour of the charged particles. There

are two well-known mathematical formulations, the Wigner-Poisson and the Schr¨odinger-

Poisson approaches, that have been widely used to describe the statistical and hydrodynamic

behavior of the plasma particles at quantum scales in quantum plasmas. These formula-

tions are the quantum analogues of the kinetic and the ﬂuid models in classical plasma

physics. Manfredi [6] has studied these approaches, taking into account the quantum eﬀects

in a collisionless quantum plasma. In particular, the quantum hydrodynamic model (QHD)

has attracted much interest in studies of the negative diﬀerential resistance [7] in the tun-

nelling diode. Several collective processes[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] have been analyzed both

analytically and numerically in plasmas with quantum corrections.

Haas et al. [15] studied a quantum multi-stream model for one- and two-stream plasma

instabilities, presented a new purely quantum branch, and investigated the stationary states

of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger-Poisson system. Anderson et al.[16] used a Wigner-Poisson

formulation showing that Landau-like damping due to phase noise can suppress the insta-

bilities. Furthermore, a detailed study of the linear and nonlinear properties of ion acoustic

waves (IAW) in an unmagnetized quantum plasma has been presented by Haas et al. [17].

For this purpose, they employed the QHD equations containing a non-dimensional quan-

tum parameter H. The latter is the ratio between the plasmon and thermal energies. For

a weakly nonlinear quantum IAW, a modiﬁed Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation was ana-

lyzed for H

2, H < 2 and H > 2, connected with a shock wave, as well as bright and

→

dark solitons, respectively. Finally, they also observed a coherent, periodic pattern for a

2

fully nonlinear IAW in a quantum plasma. Such a pattern cannot exist in classical plasmas.

The formation and dynamics of dark solitons and vortices in quantum electron plasmas has

also been reported by Shukla and Eliasson [18].

Recently, Haas [19] extended the QHD equations for quantum magnetoplasmas and pre-

sented a magnetohydrodynamic model by using the Wigner-Poisson system. He pointed

out the importance of the external magnetic ﬁeld, by establishing the conditions for equi-

librium in ideal quantum magnetohydrodynamics. Garcia et al. [20] derived the quantum

Zakharov equations by considering a one-dimensional quantum system composed of elec-

trons and singly charged ions. They also investigated the decay and four-wave instabilities

for the nonlinear coupling between high-frequency Langmuir waves and low-frequency IAWs.

Marklund [21] considered the statistical aspect and solved the Zakharov system at quantum

scales, and analyzed the modulational instability both analytically and numerically. Re-

cently, Shukla and Stenﬂo [22] investigated parametric and modulational instabilities due

to the interaction of large amplitude electromagnetic waves and low-frequency electron and

ion plasma waves in quantum plasmas. Drift modes in quantum plasmas [23], as well as new

modes in quantum dusty plasmas [24, 25], have also been considered.

In the past, Yu and Shukla [26] studied the nonlinear coupling of UH waves with low-

frequency IC waves and obtained near-sonic UH cusped envelope solitons in a classical mag-

netoplasma. The nonlinear dispersion relations [27] were also derived for three wave decay

interactions and modulational instabilities due to nonlinear interactions of mode-converted

electron Bernstein and low-frequency waves, such as IAWs, electron-acoustic waves (EAWs),

IC waves, quasimodes, magnetosonic waves, and Alfv´en waves. Murtaza and Shukla [28]

illustrated the nonlinear generation of electromagnetic waves by UH waves in a uniform

magnetoplasma. Kaufman and Stenﬂo [29] considered the interaction between UH waves

and magnetosonic modes, and showed that UH solitons could be formed.

In the present paper, we consider the nonlinear interactions between UH waves, IC waves,

LH waves, and Alfv´en waves in a quantum magnetoplasma, by using the one-dimensional

QHD equations. Both decay and modulational instabilities will be analyzed in quantum

settings. The manuscript is organized in the following fashion: In Sec. II, we derive the

governing equations for nonlinearly coupled UH waves, IC waves, LH waves, and Alfv´en

waves in quantum plasmas. The coupled equations are then space-time Fourier transformed

to obtain the dispersion relations. The latter admit a class of parametric instabilities of the

3

UHs. Details of the decay and modulational instabilities in quantum plasmas are presented

in Sec. III. Section IV summarizes our main results.

II. NONLINEAR DISPERSION RELATIONS

In this section, we derive the governing equations and dispersion relations for nonlinearly

coupled UH, IC, LH, and Alfv´en waves in a quantum magnetoplasma by using the one-

dimensional QHD equations [19].

A. UH waves

Let us consider the nonlinear propagation of an electrostatic UH wave in a cold quantum

plasma embedded in an external magnetic ﬁeld B0ˆz, where B0 is the strength of the magnetic

ﬁeld and ˆz is the unit vector along the z-axis in a Cartesian coordinates system. The UH

wave electric ﬁeld is E

In this case, the UH pump wave interacts with the low-frequency electrostatic LH waves

for the growth rates of the three-wave decay and modulational instabilities in quantum

magnetoplasmas when the UH and Alfv´en waves are nonlinearly coupled.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we have considered the nonlinear couplings between UH, IC, LH, and Alfv´en

waves in a quantum magnetoplasma. We have derived the governing nonlinear equations

and the appropriate dispersion relations by employing the one-dimensional quantum mag-

netohydrodynamical equations. It is found that the wave dispersion is due to the quantum

correction arising from the strong electron density correlations at quantum scales. The dis-

persion relations have been analyzed analytically to obtain the growth rates for both the

13

decay and modulational instabilities involving dispersive IC, LH and Alfv´en waves. Since

the frequencies of the latter are signiﬁcantly modiﬁed due to the quantum corrections, the

growth rates are accordingly aﬀected in quantum magnetoplasmas. The present results can

be important for diagnostic purposes in magnetized quantum systems, such as those in dense

astrophysical objects, intense laser-matter experiments, and in dense semiconductor devices

in an external magnetic ﬁeld.

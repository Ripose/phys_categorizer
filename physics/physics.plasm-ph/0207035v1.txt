Abstract

On the basis of a quantum-statistical approach to the electrical conductivity of nonideal
plasmas we derive analytical results in the classical low-density regime, in the degenerate
Born limit, and for the contribution of the Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect. These explicit
results are used to construct an improved interpolation formula of the electrical conductivity
valid in a wide range of temperature and density which allows to compare with available
experimental data of nonideal plasmas.

Introduction

Optical and transport properties of plasmas are governed by the mutual Coulomb
interaction and depend strongly on temperature and the electron and ion density. Ex-
perimental eﬀorts for the measurement of the electrical conductivity up to high den-
sities revealed the importance of collective excitations and many-body eﬀects such as
Pauli blocking, dynamic screening and self-energy, structure factor, the Debye-Onsager
relaxation eﬀect, formation of bound states etc. [1]. Although diﬀerent methods have
been proposed for the evaluation of plasma transport properties [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], it still
remains a theoretical challenge to treat these eﬀects by a uniﬁed quantum-statistical
approach.

On the other hand, in addition to highly sophisticated approaches to the conductiv-
ity accounting for quantum statistical many-particle eﬀects, for practical use interpola-
tion formulas are of interest which are applicable in a large region of plasma parameter
values. Such interpolation formulas were developed by several authors [2, 3, 4, 5] in
order to evaluate complex physical situations, e.g., in hydrodynamical simulations for
the generation and expansion of plasmas produced by high-power lasers, energetic
heavy ion beams or magnetic compression (pinches). Based on rigorous results for
special limiting cases and possibly numerical simulations in the intermediate regions,
Pad´e-type interpolation formulas have been proven to be highly eﬀective to describe
thermodynamic as well as tranport properties.

In this paper we consider a fully ionized plasma consisting of electrons (mass me)
and singly charged ions (mass M), interacting via the Coulomb potential, at density
ne = ni = n and temperature T (hydrogen plasma). The dimensionless parameters

Using these dimensionless plasma parameters, the construction of interpolation
formulas for the dc conductivity has been performed in diﬀerent works.
Ichimaru
and Tanaka [2] considered a two-component plasma at ﬁnite temperatures within a
generalized Ziman formula by taking into account dynamic local ﬁeld eﬀects in the
dielectric function and the dynamic ion-ion structure factor. The collision integrals
were evaluated in Born approximation to study a strongly coupled and degenerate
1. The correct nondegenerate limit was incorporated
plasma with Γ
in a semiempirical way by adopting a prefactor in correspondence to the well-known
Spitzer formula.

Ebeling et al. [3] and Lee and More [4] used the relaxation time approximation for
the evaluation of the collision integrals both in the low-density (nondegenerate) and
high-density (degenerate) regime. Electron-electron interactions are neglected in that
approximation which is only justiﬁed in the degenerate case because of Pauli blocking.
The consideration of electron-electron scattering is, however, decisive to obtain the
right low-density result, the prefactor of the Spitzer formula. This has been modeled
using a semiempirical ansatz. Furthermore, Rinker [5] has derived an interpolation
formula for the electrical conductivity from an improved Ziman formula which are
applicable in the strongly coupled, degenerate domain.

Within a quantum statistical approach, the transport properties within the gener-
alized linear response theory of Zubarev have been evaluated [7] and rigorous analytical
results for the electrical conductivity have been derived which are valid in the low-
density (nondegenerate) and high-density (degenerate) limit [7, 8, 9]. The inﬂuence of
non-equilibrium two-particle correlations in lowest order (Debye-Onsager eﬀect) has
been reconsidered recently [10]. Based on these results and taking into account other
approaches, we will construct an improved interpolation formula for the electrical con-
ductivity to cover a wide range of temperatures and densities.

2 Electrical conductivity

Using the plasma parameters (1), we can express the electrical conductivity as

σ(n, T ) =

(kBT )3/2(4πǫ0)2
1/2
e e2

m

σ∗(Γ, Θ)

with a universal function σ∗(Γ, Θ) depending on the characteristic plasma parameters
exclusively.

Our quantum-statistical approach to the electrical conductivity is based on a gen-
eralized Boltzmann equation which is derived from linear response theory [7]. A ﬁnite-
moment approximation of single and two-particle distribution functions deﬁnes the set
of relevant observables Bn, and the electrical conductivity is obtained from the ratio

The two-particle center of mass momentum is deﬁned via P =

relevant observables Bn and of the equilibrium statistical operator ρ0 is given by the
standard system Hamiltonian of a fully ionized plasma, see Ref. [7]. The correlation
functions D[Bn′; Bn] are related to thermodynamic Green functions. Thus, eﬃcient di-
agram techniques provide a systematic treatment of many-particle eﬀects in a strongly
coupled plasma which has been demonstrated for the single and two-particle level, see
Refs. [7, 10].

including the total electron momentum (P0) and the ideal energy current (P1). A
systematic increase in the number of moments results in a converging expression of
the conductivity as it is known from the Kohler variational principle or the Grad and
Chapman-Enskog method of kinetic theory.

The correlation functions D[Pn, Pm] are given by a sum of ladder diagrams in the
low-density limit. Both the electron-electron and the electron-ion scattering processes
are included, see Ref. [8]. The scattering integrals have been evaluated in various
approximations which are appropriate for a given density and temperature range.

(i) The correlation functions in the classical limit (Γ2Θ

1) are related to Boltz-
mann collision integrals which are given by transport cross sections. These quantities
are treated in the quasi-classical approximation as relevant for low-energy particles.
Additional quantum corrections are found from a WKB expansion of the collison inte-
grals. Using a three-moment approximation for the one-particle distribution function
[11] we ﬁnd for Γ2Θ

leads to a decreased plasma conductivity. Spatial symmetry properties of the two-
particle distribution function in the case of an applied electric ﬁeld restricts the mo-
ments to the electron-ion contribution δnm,m′
(q) [10]. The evaluation of the ﬁrst
moment f 0,0
ei = 1 in the low-density regime gives the original Onsager result of the
Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect [7, 10]. This eﬀect decreases the conductivity due to
an incomplete formation of the screening cloud and was ﬁrst considered in the theory
of electrolytes [14]. An equivalent formulation is the hydrodynamic approximation
in kinetic theory and assumes a local equilibrium for the distribution functions [15].
As this assumption already fails to describe the single-particle properties (Spitzer for-
mula) properly also higher two-particle moments have been considered in Ref. [10].
Corrections to the Onsager result were indeed found for a fully ionized plasma from
the second moments δn2,0

Interpolation formula and results

An interpolation formula can be constructed on the basis of the explicit analytical
results given above so that reliable results for the electrical conductivity are obtained
easily for a wide range of density and temperature without the necessity to evaluate
the underlying complicated many-particle methods in full detail. The original inter-
1) and Born limit
polation formula given in Ref. [9] included the low-density (Γ

(Γ2Θ
1). We improve the validity region and the accuracy of that formula in the
present paper by (i) taking into account the corrections due to the Debye-Onsager
relaxation eﬀect and (ii) by a better analytical structure of the interpolation formula,
avoiding unphysical behavior such as, e.g., poles in the entire (Γ, Θ)-plane. (iii) Fur-
thermore we incorporate the results of Ichimaru and Tanaka in the strongly coupled
and degenerate limit (Θ
1) by analyzing their parameterized numerical re-
sults. Thus the validity range of our interpolation formula is extended to a parameter
range where the inﬂuence of the ion-ion structure factor becomes relevant.
We propose the following interpolation formula [T in K, σ in (Ωm)−1]:

The parameters ai are ﬁxed by the low-density virial expansion.
In particular, the
corrections from the Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect are included in the function D.
The coeﬃcients bi are used to adjust the Ichimaru and Tanaka results in the strong
degenerate limit, and the parameters ci were ﬁtted to numerical data of the correlation
functions. The explicit set of parameters is given by a0 = 0.03064, a1 = 1.1590,
a2 = 0.698, a3 = 0.4876, a4 = 0.1748, a5 = 0.1, a6 = 0.258, b1 = 1.95, b2 = 2.88,
b3 = 3.6, c1 = 1.5, c2 = 6.2, c3 = 0.3, c4 = 0.35, c5 = 0.1.

We compare the results of the new interpolation formula (13) with the former one
given in [9], the Ichimaru-Tanaka ﬁt formula [2], and experimental data for strongly
coupled plasmas [16, 17, 18] in Table 1. Taking into account an experimental error
of about 30% we ﬁnd a good agreement between theory and experiment. However,
complete correspondence with the experiments can not be anticipated because of de-
viations from the Coulomb potential for the electron-ion interaction in rare gases and
the occurrence of neutral particles (partial ionization) not included in the present
theoretical approach, which is focussed to the fully ionized Coulomb system. The
Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect leads to a reduction of the electrical conductivity in
the order of 5% at Γ
1. A direct comparison with simulation results would be
highly desirable. However, the standard approach through the current-current auto-
correlation function is still limited by the small number of simulated particles and the
corresponding statistical uncertainties.

≈

The validity range of the new interpolation formula (13) is restricted to a param-
eter range where the formation of bound states (Θ
1) can be neglected. Partial
ionization plays a crucial role in low-temperature plasmas and can lead to a minimum
in the isotherms of the electrical conductivity, see Ref. [19] for the case of hydrogen.
Bound states (atoms) are also important when evaluating the hopping conductivity

for ﬂuid hydrogen near to the nonmetal-to-metal transition at megabar pressures [20].
At present, the treatment of the dc conductivity for plasmas where bound states may
occur is performed within the model of the partially ionized plasma, where the com-
position is determined within a thermodynamic approach, and the contribution of
the interactions between the diﬀerent components is considered separately. Within
such an approach, the interpolation formula given here may be of use to describe the
contribution of the interaction between electrons and ions to the conductivity.

≥

The generalization of the present approach to plasmas with higher charged ions
Z
1 is also possible but not intended here. Then, comparison with new experimental
data for strongly coupled metal plasmas with Γ
1 [21, 22] can be performed, see
[23]. The inclusion of bound state formation and the extension to higher charged ions
should be considered as possible goals of future work on interpolation formula for the
electrical conductivity of nonideal plasmas.

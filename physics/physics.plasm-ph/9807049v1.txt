Abstract

We derive the force exerted in the background plasma by an arbitrary dis-
tribution of non interacting quasi-particles, corresponding to either collective
excitations of the plasma (plasmons, phonons) or dressed particles (photons,
neutrinos). Our approach is based on the eﬀective Hamiltonian describing
the quasi-classical dynamics of the individual particles in the presence of a
background medium. We recover the usual results for the relativistic pon-
deromotive force of a photon gas, and we derive the force, due to weak inter-
actions, exerted by the electron-neutrinos in a background medium contain-
ing electrons, positrons and neutrons with arbitrary distribution functions.
Generalization to other background species and other neutrino ﬂavors is also
discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The ponderomotive force of electromagnetic waves [1–6] is a key concept in plasma
physics [7,8] and plays a central role in our present understanding of intense laser-plasma
interactions [9]. This force arises whenever a non-uniform oscillating electric ﬁeld is present
in a dielectric, and can be seen as a slow time scale eﬀect, or the average eﬀect, due to some
non-uniformity of the high frequency oscillations of the electric ﬁeld [10].

In general, the derivation of the ponderomotive force is based on the analysis of the
single particle dynamics of charged particles in the presence of the electric ﬁeld [1–6]. By
averaging the motion of the charged particle over the fast time scale, corresponding to
the high frequency oscillations of the ﬁeld, the slow time scale dynamics of the individual
particles can then be calculated, and the net eﬀect of the electromagnetic forces acting on
the particle can be reduced to the ponderomotive force. In this paper, we present a diﬀerent
approach, which allows us not only to rederive the previous results, but also to generalize,
in a straightforward way, the concept of ponderomotive force to other physical conditions
or other quasi-particles besides photons (e.g. dressed neutrinos).

The starting point of our treatment is a semi-classical description of the ﬁelds interacting
with the plasma. In this way, we describe the ﬁelds by their equivalent quasi-particles, or
elementary quanta: photons for the electromagnetic ﬁeld, plasmons for the longitudinal
electrostatic oscillations, phonons for the ion acoustic oscillations, and dressed neutrinos for
the neutrino ﬁeld interacting with the background medium. The interaction of the quasi-
particles with the plasma is described by the dispersion relation, or the eﬀective Hamiltonian,
for each one of the ﬁelds or quasi-particles. The eﬀective Hamiltonian can be derived either
from a classical or a quantum ﬁeld theory. The key point of our formalism is that by knowing
the eﬀective Hamiltonian describing a single quasi-particle dynamics we are then able to
derive the force exerted by a gas of non interacting elementary quanta in the background
plasma: the dispersion relation, or the eﬀective Hamiltonian, generates the equations of
motion of the quasi-particles.

Even if the term ponderomotive force was coined to describe the forces acting on a
dielectric in an arbitrary non uniform electric ﬁeld, in this paper we generalize the concept
to the interaction of any non uniform ﬁeld with a background medium. In fact, the force
exerted in a background medium due to a non uniform ﬁeld can also be seen as the pressure
gradient arising due to some inhomogeneity in the quasi-particle distribution. We emphasize
that a similar picture was proposed by Zeldovich and Novikov [11], where two types of
gravitational pressure were identiﬁed: the usual ﬁeld pressure associated with the mean
energy density of the ﬁeld, and a second type of ”pressure” associated with nonuniformities
or ﬂuctuations of the gravitational ﬁeld.

We aim to achieve two objectives: to derive the ponderomotive force solely based on the
quasi-particle concept, thus providing an easy tool to generalize and unify the concept for
diﬀerent physical scenarios, and to explicitly show the relation between the ponderomotive
force and the wave action density, or the quasi-particle number density.

Our focus will be on the derivation of the force exerted by an arbitrary distribution of
quasi-particles. In Section II, we present our formalism and the approximations involved
in our description. The general expression for the ponderomotive force is then derived and
represented as a function of the eﬀective Hamiltonian or dispersion relation (describing the

3

quasi-classical dynamics of the quasi-particles) and the quasi-particles distribution function.
In Section III, we apply our results to classical ﬁelds arising in a plasma. The ponderomotive
force exerted by a gas of photons in a plasma is rederived in the relativistic regime, thus
showing the equivalence between our new approach and the derivation of the ponderomotive
force found in the literature. We also derive the force due to a gas of plasmons and a gas
of phonons. In Section IV, we consider the interaction of a gas of neutrinos with a dense
plasma, also containing other species of baryonic matter (such as neutrons, protons and
positrons). The ponderomotive force exerted in the background medium is then derived.
In our derivation we assume that each one of the species in the medium has an arbitrary
distribution function, thus generalizing previous results only valid for cold plasmas [12–14].
Finally, in Section V, the results of this paper are summarized.

II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

Consider a gas of non interacting quasi-particles (QPs) in a background medium. By
quasi-particles, we mean not only elementary collective excitations of the background
medium, such as plasmons and phonons, but also dressed photons or dressed neutrinos.
Our formalism is independent of the entities we are considering as QPs, but we assume that
the interaction between them is negligible. This corresponds to either considering collision
frequencies νqq much smaller than the typical time scale of the process in study(dilute gas) or
simply assuming that the interaction between quasi-particles can be discarded. Furthermore,
we consider that the dynamics of a single QP is governed by the eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ,
which is a function not only of the dynamical variables of the single QP (momentum and
position) but is also dependent of the properties of the medium where the QPs propagate.
Using in a direct way the results already known for the ponderomotive force of e.m.waves
in a dielectric, we could immediately propose an expression for the ponderomotive force,
written as a function of the number of photons. This approach would not show, however,
the connection between the eﬀective interaction felt by a single QP and the expression of
the ponderomotive force, thus preventing the generalization to other physical conditions.
Also, the dependence of the ponderomotive force on the wave action density, or QP number
density, would not be clearly stated for non trivial QP distribution functions. Therefore,
a diﬀerent path must be followed. By determining the free energy of the system, we can
relate the changes in the free energy with the work performed by the force exerted by the
distribution of particles, and from that derive the ponderomotive force.

We can write the total free energy as the sum of two contributions: the free energy
of the background medium in the absence of QPs (F0) and the change in the free energy
(for a given temperature and density) resulting from the presence of the ﬁeld elementary
excitations. Therefore, the free energy is written as

F = F0(ρ, T ) + gsq

where ρ is the density of the medium, T is the temperature of the medium, and fq describes
the QP distribution function in phase-space (r, k), r describes the QP position and k is
related to the QP momentum pq by k = pq/¯h. For the sake of completeness we state here
the most important properties of fq:

statistical weight and it accounts for spin degeneracy of the QPs.

We now generalize the procedure described in ref. [10] for electromagnetic waves. Let us
assume that an isothermal deformation u of the background inﬁnite medium occurs. If the
distribution of quasi-particles exerts a force f over the medium, work δW will be done by
that force, such that

δW =

dr f

u .

Z

·

where f has the dimensions of force per unit volume. We consider that this force will act only
on the electrons of the background medium. The ponderomotive force felt by the ions can be
discarded since it is me/mi smaller than the ponderomotive force felt by the electrons (me
is the electron rest mass, and mi is the ion mass). However, inclusion of other background
species is straightforward. δW can be related with the change in the free energy for the
same displacement u, since δW =

F0). Going back to eq.(1), we easily obtain

We will assume a quasi-static distribution of quasi-particles, which means that a displace-
ment of the background medium will not aﬀect the distribution fq. Furthermore, fq is a
function only of the dynamical variables. Hence, the second term in eq.(6) is zero. The
eﬀective energy Heﬀ of each QP will be aﬀected by the isothermal background deformation,
since Heﬀ depends not only on the dynamical variables but also on the properties of the
background medium. The change in Heﬀ has two contributions: (i) δ(1)Heﬀ, due to the fact
that particles from the background medium are pushed from r
u to r, and (ii) δ(2)Heﬀ, due
to the change of the distribution function, or density, of the background medium in position
r. The ﬁrst contribution for δHeﬀ is

For the remaining contribution, we ﬁrst use the fact that the relative change in the volume

density nbg is δnbg =

Therefore, δ(2)Heﬀ can be written either as

It also represents a generalization for arbitrary ﬁelds of the Landau and Lifshitz arguments
[10].

III. PONDEROMOTIVE FORCE OF PHOTONS, PLASMONS AND PHONONS

N

(r, k, t). The number of photons

Having determined the general expression for the ponderomotive force of a gas of non-
interacting QPs, we now proceed by evaluating eq.(12) for diﬀerent classical ﬁelds or classical
QPs. We ﬁrst consider the ponderomotive force due to a distribution of photons charac-
terized by fq ≡ N
, obeying the properties (2-4) can be
obtained from the Wigner function of the electromagnetic ﬁeld [15]. The concept of the num-
ber of photons was introduced in the Plasma Physics literature in the 60’s, associated with
the Random Phase Approximation [16]. We point out, however, that a proper deﬁnition of
the number of photons based on the Wigner function, can describe any e.m.ﬁeld conﬁgura-
,
tion (see Appendix, for a detailed discussion of this problem). For the number of photons
N
the role of the eﬀective Hamiltonian Heﬀ is played by ¯hω(r, k, t)
¯hωk, where the frequency
ωk is obtained from the dispersion relation for the electromagnetic waves propagating in
the plasma. This is equivalent to assuming that each single photon obeys the dispersion
relation for plane electromagnetic waves. Since we are considering an arbitrary distribution
of photons, the relativistic mass correction must also be included in the dispersion relation
for circularly polarized electromagnetic plane waves:

of the electric ﬁeld intensity and the energy distribution function of the electrons in the
background plasma. For the sake of clarity, we will not write down the explicit expression
for γ, since it will not add any additional features to our derivation. We note that in (14),
k, r, and t are independent variables. Furthermore, eq.(14) is valid in the limits of the
geometrical optics approximation [17] i.e.

These limits establish the conditions in which this approach is valid: whenever two very

where A is the high frequency vector potential. It is straightforward to see that ponderomo-

photons distribution function
and/or spatial dependent frequency. Present understand-
ing of ultraintense short laser pulse propagation in plasmas is based on the diﬀerent roles
played by these two contributions [18]. Equation (19) agrees with previous derivations of
the relativistic ponderomotive force for circularly polarized photons [1,2,4–6]. For linearly
polarized plane electromagnetic waves, the dispersion relation (14) is no longer valid; a dif-
ferent expression for the relativistic ponderomotive force appears [3], which under certain
conditions reduces to (19). As far as we know, eq.(18) is the ﬁrst derivation of the relativistic
ponderomotive force, using solely the number of photons concept. Also, eq.(18) is valid for
is deﬁned using the proper deﬁnition of Wigner
any e.m.ﬁeld conﬁguration, as long as
function for an arbitrary e.m.ﬁeld (see Appendix).

For a gas of plasmons (electron plasma oscillations), an expression similar to eq.(18) can

also be derived in a similar manner, but now the dispersion relation is

The ponderomotive force of the gas of plasmons can then describe the coupling of the
electrostatic oscillations with the low frequency, long wavelength ion acoustic oscillations
[16].

We now consider the ponderomotive force due to a gas of elementary collective ion ex-
citations. Due to the limits of our formalism (see eq.(15)), this gas of ion oscillations must
interact with even lower frequency and longer wavelength plasma perturbations. In a un-
magnetized electron-ion plasma, such physical condition cannot be veriﬁed. However, dusty
plasmas support oscillations with characteristic frequencies(wavelengths) much lower(longer)
than those of ion oscillations (ion acoustic waves or ion plasma waves) [19]. The picture of
a gas of ion oscillations in a dust-acoustic oscillation is then reasonable. The general linear
dispersion relation for ion oscillations is [8]

We then see that the ponderomotive force associated with ion collective excitations,
eqns.(25,26), is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that associated with photons, eq.(18), or plas-
mons, eq.(21). This derivation must now be veriﬁed using the standard plasma physics
methods. The coupling between the ion collective motions and the background medium can
play a signiﬁcant role in the (de)stabilization of dust-acoustic oscillations in a dusty plasma.
Both these features will be explored in a future work.

IV. PONDEROMOTIVE FORCE OF NEUTRINOS IN DENSE PLASMAS

We now turn to the central result of this paper: the ponderomotive force of neutrinos
in a plasma. This force can provide the coupling mechanism responsible for the anomalous
scattering of neutrinos and the consequent deposition in the plasma of some part of the
neutrino energy released in a supernovae explosion [12,20]. This energy deposition plays a
key role in the present understanding of supernovae explosions [21]. An intuitive picture
of the ponderomotive force is immediate:
if in a given region the energy density in the
neutrinos is higher than in other regions, a force will be exerted in the background medium
by the neutrinos, towards the regions of lower neutrino energy density. This corresponds to

9

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

the physical picture of the neutrinos trying to push their way into regions of lower energy
density.

In order to derive the ponderomotive force due to the electron-neutrinos (νe) propa-
gating in a background medium we ﬁrst write down the eﬀective Hamiltonian for a single
electron-neutrino in a unmagnetized background of electrons characterized by the electron
distribution function fe(r, pe, t) [22]:

function of the electron momentum pe), and mν is the neutrino mass, which can be set to
zero for massless neutrinos. gse = 2 is the statistical weight for the electrons, corresponding
to spin 1/2, and appears because of spin degeneracy. Also, fe(r, pe, t) veriﬁes

The eﬀective potential (28) has been derived using the methods of Finite Temperature
Quantum Field Theory. Hence, our approach here is clearly a semi-classical one: we assume
that the interaction of the neutrinos with the electrons is governed by quantum processes
(included in Veﬀ), and we take into account the Fermi statistics of the phase space density of
the particle numbers, but the neutrino dynamics is determined by the classical Hamiltonian
obtained using the equivalence principle, and we neglect the spins. This approximation is
valid as long as changes in Veﬀ occur over length scales much longer than the neutrino de
Broglie wavelength λν = 2π/

, and no spin waves are considered.

We ﬁrst analyze the contribution of the term pe ·

ˆkν/Ee to the eﬀective Hamiltonian (27).
If the neutrinos propagate along a precise direction, and assuming an isotropic distribution
for the electrons, the integral

averages to zero. Furthermore, if the neutrino distribution is isotropic, when integrating over
the contribution of all the neutrinos for the ponderomotive force, a zero average is obtained
once again. Therefore, this term only gives a contribution for both anisotropic neutrino and
electron distribution functions. In spite of its negligible contribution we will keep this term
in our derivation.

Since eq.(27) is also a function of the distribution function of the electrons in the back-
ground medium, eq.(9) must now be employed to obtain the expression for the ponderomo-
tive force due to the neutrinos:

Eq.(35) represents the force per unit volume exerted by the neutrinos over the electrons

tions, is diﬀerent from zero only when the electron distribution function and the neutrino
distribution function are anisotropic. This means that even for a beamed neutrino distri-
bution, the second term vanishes for an isotropic plasma. From now on we will consider an
isotropic electron distribution function, and hence we discard the contribution of the second
term in eq.(35). The ﬁrst term in eq.(35) (or eq.(36)) is then responsible for the strong
coupling between the neutrinos and the electrons, as suggested before [20]. From eq.(36),
we can easily derive the force acting on a single electron due to the presence of the neutrino
distribution:

We stress out that Eq.(36) is valid for any neutrino or electron distribution functions.

The generalization of Eq.(35,36,37) in order to derive the force exerted by the neutrinos
and antineutrinos over electrons, positrons or the neutrons is also straightforward. Changing
the eﬀective potential Veﬀ [23] in order to include the weak interaction of the electron-
neutrinos and anti electron-neutrinos with electrons(positrons), we obtain the ponderomotive
force over a single electron(positron)

where the minus(plus) sign refers to electrons(positrons), being n¯νe(r, t) the anti electron-

as

As before, we are assuming a unmagnetized background medium, and we are discarding the
contribution of the anisotropies of the electron/positron/neutron and neutrino/antineutrino
distribution functions. Generalization of the ponderomotive force due to other neutrino
ﬂavors (tau-neutrinos or muon-neutrinos) is straightforward as long as the proper eﬀective
potentials Veﬀ are considered [23].

It is now important to compare our expression of the ponderomotive force with that
ﬁrst introduced by Bingham et al [12] in a phenomenological way, or the one derived by
Hardy and Melrose [24] using the methods of Quantum Plasmadynamics. The expression
derived by Bingham et al is based on the analogy between the ponderomotive force due to
electromagnetic waves (as derived in [10]) and the ponderomotive force due to the neutrinos,
and it is only valid in the limits of validity of the Landau and Lifshitz expression i.e. as long
as the neutrino ﬂux is assumed monochromatic and the energy (or frequency) of the neutrinos
is assumed constant. In this particular physical scenario eq.(11) in ref. [12] is equivalent to
our eq.(36). A comparison with the results derived in ref. [24] shows that their results are
equivalent to those presented here, in the limit of constant background electron/positron
number density. The discrepancy is present whenever gradients of the background number
density are assumed, and it arises from a misinterpretation of the ponderomotive force
concept in reference [24], as already pointed out elsewhere [25].

It must be stressed that a long range interaction force between neutrinos and electrons
was identiﬁed before in the context of a quantum kinetic treatment of neutrinos in a lepton
plasma. An equivalent expression to eq.(36) is evident in eq.(18’) of ref. [26]. Our results
allow us to clearly identify the long range force in [26] as the ponderomotive force due to
the weak interaction of the neutrinos with a plasma.

V. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have presented a general derivation of the ponderomotive force due
to quasi-particles propagating in a background medium. In particular, the results for the
relativistic ponderomotive force of photons and for the ponderomotive force due to plasmons

12

were recovered. The force of a gas of ion collective motions in the background plasma was
also presented. We then applied the same techniques to a gas of neutrinos interacting with
a background medium through the weak interaction force. The ponderomotive force due
to an arbitrary distribution of neutrinos and antineutrinos interacting either with electrons,
positrons or neutrons was derived.

The ponderomotive force derived here is the force on a Lagrangian ﬂuid element or on
a single particle from the background medium. It then provides the proper way to build
a single-particle or a self-consistent kinetic theory for the interaction of QPs (neutrinos,
photons, plasmons, phonons) with a background medium, which can be applied as the
foundation tool for the study of QPs driven instabilities in a plasma.

VI. APPENDIX

In order to clarify the meaning and scope of the number of photons concept, we present a
calculation of the number of photons
for several e.m.ﬁeld conﬁgurations. This will allow
us to connect this concept with previous deﬁnitions found in the literature and to clearly
point out that no Random Phase Approximation is assumed when a proper deﬁnition for
the number of photons is employed.

N

The number of photons

obeys the general properties described by eqns.(3,4) for the
distribution function fq. The class of phase-space distribution functions that verify these
properties for a given wave ﬁeld, are usually denoted as Wigner functions [27]. The most

describing a monochromatic beam of photons, as expected. This is also the usual result
present in the Plasma Physics literature since the 60’s [28]. A deﬁnite test to the ability
in describing the complete structure of the electric ﬁeld arises
of the number of photons
whenever the electric ﬁeld depicts an interference pattern. The most simple case corresponds
to an electric ﬁeld described by the superposition of two plane waves E(r, t) = E0 exp i(k0 ·

The presence of two photon beams, associated with the two plane waves is obvious. Fur-
thermore, a third beam is present which results from the interference between the two plane
waves, showing the characteristic slow modulation of the beat pattern. We point out that
the high frequency components (at ω0 + ω1) have been discarded. Using eq.(3), we can im-
mediately recover the usual energy density for two interfering monochromatic planes waves.
It is then clear, that the number of photons, as described from eq.(A.1), already contains
the information about any interference pattern present in the electric ﬁeld.

To clarify this point, and make the bridge with the usual deﬁnitions, we consider the
superposition of several monochromatic plane waves, also containing an additional random
phase factor ψk. The electric ﬁeld is then written as E(r, t) =
ωk′t+ψk′).

Once again, the beat interference pattern observed in eq.(A.3) is also present for the terms
verifying ∆k′k′′
= 0. Eq.(A.4) is the generalization of eq.(A.3) for the
superposition of an arbitrary number plane waves. We stress that so far, no assumptions
have been made regarding the properties of the phases ψk. When the phases ψk are random,
a phase averaging of eq.(A.4) can be performed. This averaging corresponds to the well
<> deﬁned
known Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [28]. Being the phase averaging
as the average of a statistical ensemble of systems diﬀering from one another only in the
phase ψk or ∆ψ′ψ′′, it is obvious that < exp i∆ψ′ψ′′ >= δ(k′

This is the conventional deﬁnition of the number of photons, only valid under the limits
of the Random Phase Approximation. No interference pattern is present, thus describing
independent and non interfering photon beams.

From this discussion, it becomes evident that a deﬁnition of the number of photons
based on the Wigner function can describe rigorously diﬀerent e.m.ﬁeld conﬁgurations, even
those where interference between diﬀerent ﬁeld components is important. In the limit of
the Random Phase Approximation, the usual deﬁnitions are recovered. It may be argued
that the Wigner function presents some pathologies (it is not a positive-deﬁnite function)
which, at ﬁrst sight, could prevent its use. However, we stress that the quantities with
straightforward physical meaning are the marginals of the Wigner function, eqns.(2,3,4),
and these possess the correct physical properties.

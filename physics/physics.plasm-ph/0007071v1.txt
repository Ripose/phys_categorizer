Longitudinal and transverse behavior of magnetic ﬁeld of relativistic non-
linear three-dimensional plasma wave is investigated. It is shown that the
magnetic ﬁeld of the wave is diﬀerent from zero and performs higher fre-
quency oscillations compared to the plasma electron frequency. An increase
in the nonlinearity leads to strengthening of magnetic ﬁeld. The oscillations
of magnetic ﬁeld in transverse direction arise, that caused by the phase front
curving of nonlinear plasma wave. The numerical results well conform with
predictions of the analytical consideration of weakly-nonlinear case.

PACS number(s): 52.35.Mw, 52.40.Mj, 52.40.Nk

The progress in the technology of ultrahigh intensity lasers and high cur-
rent relativistic charged bunch sources permits the use of laser pulses1 or
charged bunches2 for excitation of strong plasma waves. The excited plasma
waves can be used, for example, for acceleration of charged particles and
focusing of bunches.2 The amplitude of longitudinal electric ﬁeld Emax of rel-
ativistic plasma waves excited in cold plasma is limited by the relativistic
wave-breaking ﬁeld3 Erel = [2(γ − 1)]1/2EW B/β, where γ = (1 − β 2)−1/2 is a
relativistic factor, β = vph/c is a dimensionless phase velocity of the wave,
EW B = meωpevph/e (EW B[V /cm] ≈ 0.96n1/2
[cm−3]) is the conventional non-
relativistic wave-breaking ﬁeld, ωpe = (4πnpe2/me)1/2 is the electron plasma
frequency, np is the equilibrium density of plasma electrons, me and e are
the mass and absolute value of the electron charge.

The linear plasma wave theory is valid when Emax ≪ EW B. It is well
known that a three-dimensional linear plasma wave in a cold plasma and in
the absence of external ﬁelds is potential.4 In this case the magnetic ﬁeld of
plasma wave is zero. The magnetic ﬁeld is absent also in one-dimensional
nonlinear case due to the symmetry of the problem. However, magnetic
ﬁeld of nonlinear three-dimensional plasma wave with the relativistic phase
velocity (β ≈ 1) was not studied up to now and our aim is to investigate this
problem.

We shall study nonlinear plasma waves (wake waves) excited in cold
plasma by relativistic electron bunches or intense laser pulses (drivers) and
suppose the azimuthal symmetry of the problem. In this case for non-zero
components of plasma electrons momentum and electromagnetic ﬁeld of the
wave we have the following set of equations5,6:

are respectively a relativistic factor, dimensionless components of velocity
and dimensionless density of plasma electrons, z = (ωpe/vph)(Z − vpht), α =
nb(z, r)/np, nb is density of bunch electrons, a = eE0(z, r)/mecω0, where E0
and ω0 are the amplitude and frequency of laser pulse, ∇⊥ = ∂/∂r+1/r. Also
the following dimensionless variables have been used: the space variables are
normalized on λp/2π = vph/ωpe, where λp is the linear plasma wavelength,
the momenta and velocities - respectively on mec and the velocity of light
and the strengths of electric and magnetic ﬁelds - on the nonrelativistic wave-
breaking ﬁeld EW B. In the general case the analytical consideration of the
problem seems impossible. First we consider weakly-nonlinear case and then
present numerical results.

In the weakly-nonlinear case we suppose β = 1 and use the generaliza-
tion of the well known expansion7 which was used to study one-dimensional
nonlinear relativistic-plasma-waves8:

u(r, z) = εu1(r, Ψ) + ε2u2(r, Ψ) + ε3u3(r, Ψ) + ...,
∂Ψ/∂z = 1 + εk1(r) + ε2k2(r) + ...,

(8)

where u stands for normalized values Pz,r, Ez,r or Hθ, ε = Emax
z ≪ 1 is the
small parameter, Pz,r, Ez,r, Hθ ≪ 1, Λp is the nonlinear plasma wavelength.
Substituting expansion (8) into equations (1)-(5) we have:

where subscript i denotes the order of approximation and S1−5,i are the non-
linear functions of ui−1, ui−2, ..., and u1. In the linear case (i = 1) S1−5,1 = 0
and one can obtain well known solutions (see, e.g., Ref. 9): Pz1 = −R sin Ψ,
Pr1 = (dR/dr) cos Ψ, Ez1 = −R cos Ψ, Er1 = −(dR/dr) sin Ψ, and Hθ1 = 0,
where R(r) depends on the radial distribution in the exciting source, i. e.,
on α(r) or a2(r). In the second approximation, from the condition of absence
of resonance terms (proportional to sin Ψ or cos Ψ) one can ﬁnd that k1 = 0.
Then

S4,2 = Pz1(∇⊥Er1 + ∂Ez1/∂Ψ),
S5,2 = 0,

and for magnetic ﬁeld strength we obtain the following equation:

[(∂/∂r)∇⊥ − 1]Hθ2 = ∂S4,2/∂r − ∂S3,2/∂Ψ.

Solution of this equation is

Hθ2 = f1(r) + f2(r) cos(2Ψ),

where f1,2(r) satisﬁes to equations

(14)

(15)

(∆⊥ − r−2 − 1)f1 = (1/2)(d/dr)[R(∆⊥ − 1)R],
(∆⊥ − r−2 − 1)f2 = (1/2)[(dR/dr)∆⊥R − R(d/dr)∆⊥R],

here ∆⊥ = ∇⊥(d/dr) is the transverse part of Laplacian.
In the i − th
approximation Hθi ∼ cos(iΨ). The dependence k2(r) can be obtained in
the third approximation. So, the weakly-nonlinear theory predicts that the
magnetic ﬁeld of 3D nonlinear plasma wave is not zero, in opposite to the
3D linear case and to 1D nonlinear one, and oscillates at the harmonics of
the linear plasma frequency; the nonlinear wavelength changes in the radial
direction.

We have solved Eqs. (1) - (6) numerically choosing the Gaussian proﬁle

of the driver both in longitudinal and transverse directions:

A(z, r) = A0 exp[−(z − z0)2/σ2

z] exp(−r2/σ2

r),

(16)

where A(z, r) stands for α or a2. Fig. 1 shows three-dimensional linear
plasma wave excited by relativistic electron bunch. The linear numerical
solution obtained well agreed with predictions of the linear theory.2 As is
seen in Figure 1(b), in the linear case the magnetic ﬁeld excited in plasma
is localized in the range occupied by the bunch and in the wake Emax
z ≫
H max

≈ 0, that correspond to the linear theory.

θ

In the nonlinear regime the behavior of plasma waves is qualitatively
changed. In Fig. 2 one can see a nonlinear plasma wave that is excited by
an intense laser pulse. The main diﬀerence here from the linear case is the
change of shape and length of the wave with the radial coordinate r [see Fig.
2(a)]. The magnetic ﬁeld strength in the nonlinear plasma wave as shown in
Figure 2(b) is diﬀerent from zero and has the magnitude comparable with
that of other components of the ﬁeld. The magnitude of higher frequency

4

oscillations (as compared to the plasma frequency) performed by the mag-
netic ﬁeld along z grows in proportion to the nonlinearity. Such a behavior of
magnetic ﬁeld is a purely nonlinear eﬀect. Indeed, in the linear case Hθ = 0,
i.e., the contribution of momentum components at the plasma frequency in
the expression (7) is compensated. The nonlinearity of the wave implies a
rise of higher harmonics in Pz and Pr. According to (7), the rise of magnetic
ﬁeld is due to these harmonics and this accounts for frequent oscillations seen
in Figure 2(b), that conforms with the weakly-nonlinear analytical considera-
tion presented above. On the other hand, the non-zero magnetic ﬁeld means,
according to (7), that the motion of plasma electrons in the nonlinear wave
is turbulent (rotP 6= 0). The degree of turbulence (the measure of which is
Hθ) grows in proportion to the nonlinearity.

It is easy to see that due to the dependence of the wavelength on r, the
ﬁeld in the radial direction grows more chaotic as the distance from the driver
increases.
In fact, the oscillations of plasma for diﬀerent r are ”started”
behind the driver with nearly equal phases but diﬀerent wavelengths [see
Fig. 2(a)]. As |z| increases, the change of phase in transverse direction (for
ﬁxed z) becomes more and more marked. This leads to a curving of the phase
front and to ”oscillations” in the transverse direction.6,10 The radial behavior
of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld of the nonlinear plasma
wave is presented in Fig. 3. Qualitatively the radial dependence of the ﬁeld
diﬀers from that of the linear case by the change of sign and ”steepening” of
ﬁelds along r and that is connected with the curvature of wave phase front.
So, we have found that the magnetic ﬁeld of nonlinear plasma wave is
diﬀerent from zero and performs higher frequency oscillations as compared
to the plasma frequency. The latter qualitatively diﬀers from the linear
case and one-dimensional nonlinear one. The obtained numerical results well
agreed with the predictions of weakly-nonlinear theory.

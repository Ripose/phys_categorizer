Abstract

The quantum Zakharov system is described in terms of a La-
grangian formalism. A time-dependent Gaussian trial function ap-
proach for the envelope electric ﬁeld and the low-frequency part of
the density ﬂuctuation leads to a coupled, nonlinear system of ordi-
nary diﬀerential equations.
In the semiclassic case, linear stability
analysis of this dynamical system shows a destabilizing rˆole played by
quantum eﬀects. Arbitrary value of the quantum eﬀects are also con-
sidered, yielding the ultimate destruction of the localized, Gaussian
trial solution. Numerical simulations are shown both for the semiclas-
sic and the full quantum cases.

1 Introduction

Quantum plasmas have received much attention in recent times, especially
because of the ongoing miniaturization of ultrasmall electronic devices and
micromechanical systems [1] and to the relevance of quantum eﬀects for in-
tense laser-plasmas [2] and for dense astrophysical objects [3]. Frequently,

the de Broglie wavelength of the charge carriers (electrons, positrons, holes)
of these systems is comparable to the characteristic dimensions of the sys-
tem, making a quantum treatment unavoidable. Advances in the area in-
cludes construction of quantum ion-acoustic waves [4], quantum magnetohy-
drodynamics theories [5], quantum beam instabilities [6]–[8] and shear Alfv´en
modes in ultra-cold quantum magnetoplasmas [9]. New quantum collective
excitations have also been identiﬁed for ultra-cold dusty plasmas [10]–[15],
where quantum eﬀects can be used for plasma diagnostics. Recently, spin
eﬀects have been included for non relativistic quantum plasmas [16, 17].
Possible decisive applications of spin eﬀects in quantum plasmas can appear
in solid state plasmas as well as in pulsars and magnetars, with very intense
magnetic ﬁelds (greater than 108T ). A more detailed review on quantum
plasma models and their range of validity can be found in [18].

The quantum Zakharov equations [19], the subject of the present work,
form a set of coupled, nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations for the envelope
electric ﬁeld and the slow part of the density ﬂuctuation in an electron-ion
electrostatic quantum plasma. It models the interaction between quantum
Langmuir and quantum ion-acoustic waves. Exactly as for the classical Za-
kharov system [20], the derivation of the quantum Zakharov equations comes
from the existence of two time scales, a fast one associated to quantum
Langmuir waves, and a slow one associated to quantum ion-acoustic waves.
Sample applications can be found for quantum decay and four-wave insta-
bilities, with relevant changes of the classical dispersions [19]. The quantum
Zakharov system was also analyzed for the enhancement of modulational in-
stabilities due to combination of partial coherence and quantum corrections
[21]. More recently, the coupling between nonlinear Langmuir waves and
electron holes in Wigner-Poisson quantum plasmas was studied via a two
time scales formalism [22].

The existence of coherent structures, as soliton solutions for instance, is
a relevant issue for any system of evolution equations. As an example from
quantum plasmas, stable vortices and dark solitons have been constructed
for Schr¨odinger-Poisson quantum electron plasmas [23]. At quantum scales,
the transport of information in ultracold micromechanical systems can be
addressed by means of such nonlinear structures. The basic objective of the
present work is the investigation of the quantum eﬀects for the existence of
localized solutions for the quantum Zakharov system. Unlike the approach
of Yang et al., where exact bright solitons, gray solitons, W-solitons and M-
solitons were found for the quantum Zakharov system [24], here approximate

2

solutions are obtained through a variational formulation and a trial function
method. Exact solutions are of course very relevant, but variational solutions
provides more insight on the rˆole of quantum eﬀects. For instance, the clas-
sical Zakharov equations admit the Langmuir soliton solution [25]. Using a
Gaussian ansatz as a trial function extremizing an action functional, one can
get information about the perturbation of the Langmuir soliton by quantum
eﬀects. A priori, one can expect that wave-packet spreading and tunneling
tends to enlarge the width of localized wave solutions. Other possibility is
the appearance of instabilities of pure quantum nature, eventually destroying
any coherent structure. Besides these considerations, the construction of a
variational formulation for the quantum Zakharov equations is important by
itself. Notice that the internal vibrations of solitary waves for the classical
Zakharov system were analyzed by a variational approach using Gaussian
trial functions [26]. The present contribution extends this work to the quan-
tum realm. Similar time-dependent variational methods were also used, for
instance, for the nonlinear pulse propagation in optical ﬁbers [27] and for
Bose-Einstein condensates [28].

Variational methods can indicate a general tendency of s system for which
no general closed form solution is available. For instance, one can study
the changes of localized or solitonic trial functions under the changes of a
control parameter. The quantum Zakharov equations (see Section II) possess
a single dimensionless quantity H measuring the importance of quantum
perturbations. It is one basic task of this work, to analyze the changes in
Gaussian trial function solutions for the quantum Zakharov system induced
by modiﬁcations in H.

This work is organized as follows. In section II, the quantum Zakharov
system is described by a variational formulation. A variational solution in
the form of a Gaussian ansatz is then proposed, in order to reproduce the
main properties of the Langmuir soliton solution admitted in the classical
limit. This time-dependent trial function approach leads to a dynamical sys-
tem which can be analyzed for several parameter regimes. In section III, only
the ﬁrst-order quantum correction is retained, yielding a set of two coupled,
nonlinear second-order ordinary diﬀerential equations for the widths of the
envelope electric ﬁeld and density perturbation. This nonlinear system is an-
alyzed for its linear stability properties as well as for the existence of bounded
solutions. In section IV, arbitrary strength of the quantum eﬀects is allowed,
resulting in a full system of equations. Further, the ultra-quantum case where
quantum eﬀects are the more relevant inﬂuence is analyzed, showing the ulti-

3

mate destruction of the Langmuir soliton due to wave-packet spreading and
tunneling. Section V is reserved to the conclusions.

where E0 is an arbitrary real parameter. Strictly, collisions of Langmuir “soli-
tons” does not simply imply phase shifts between them [25], as expected for
solitonic objects. Nevertheless, it is the interplay between nonlinear and dis-
persive terms in the classical Zakharov system which allows for the existence
of such coherent structures. Physically, the Langmuir soliton represents a
hole in the low frequency part of the electron-ion density maintained self-
consistently by the ponderomotive force. It would be desirable to achieve a
better understanding of the quantum eﬀects for this soliton solution. A priori
one can expect tunneling of electrons trapped in the self-consistent potential,
perturbing the remarkable stability of the Langmuir solitons in the classical
case. Indeed, isolated classical Langmuir solitons do not decay [25].

A variational solution which reproduces the gross features of (9-10) and

is at the same time analytically accessible is the Gaussian ansatz

E = A exp(

where A, B, a, b, φ and κ are functions of time. We assume A and B positive
to maintain resemblance with (9-10). As for any time-dependent variational
method, notice that a main drawback of the Gaussian ansatz is that it does
not allow for changes in the shape of the solution. The classical Zakharov
system can be treated by a variational approach using a combination of
Jacobi elliptic functions [29], but we use Gaussian functions for the sake of
simplicity.

In order to calculate the Lagrangian L =

dx corresponding to (11-

function u. Combining (5) and (12) and introducing M = Bb, it follows that

last two terms at (17) contains the quantum corrections.

Variation in φ gives ˙N = 0, just reproducing the conservation of the high

frequency quanta. Variation in κ, the so-called chirp function, gives

a ˙a = 4κa2 + 12H 2κ(1 + 4κ2a4) .

(18)

In contrast to the classical case where the chirp function is easily derived
from a(t), in the quantum case κ is given in terms of a as the solution of the
third-degree equation (18). Hence, expressing κ in terms of a and ˙a would
give equations too cumbersome to be of any value. A reasonable alternative
in the semiclassic limit is to solve (18) for κ as a power series in H 2. Other
possibility is to regard (18) as a dynamical equation to be numerically solved
for a(t). Both approaches will be considered in what follows.

Equations (18-20) form a complete system for the dynamical variables
a, κ and s and are the basis for the conclusions in the following. The system
(18-20) will be studied in the semiclassic limit, both for linear and nonlinear
oscillations, and for arbitrary values of the quantum parameter H.

3 Semiclassic oscillations

It is of considerable interest to investigate the modiﬁcations in the Langmuir
soliton induced by small quantum eﬀects. When H is a small parameter,

It is relevant to check (20)-(22) for the linear stability of ﬁxed points. For
the Langmuir soliton (9-10) one have equal values for M and N. Since we
are mainly interested in the rˆole of quantum eﬀects for the Langmuir soliton,
in the rest of the section we set M = N. Since quantum eﬀects are small,
one can search for ﬁxed points for the dynamical system as a power series in
H 2. An easy calculation then yields critical points at (a, s) = (a0, s0), with

of the Gaussian for the envelope electric ﬁeld increases less than the width
b associated to the density. Moreover, both characteristic lengths increase,
pointing for a wave-packet spreading eﬀect.

For consistency one could also expand the square root at (26) up to O(H 2)
terms, but this would result in a more cumbersome expression.

Unstable linear oscillations corresponds to solutions with Im(ω) < 0.
A straightforward algebra shows that such instabilities are impossible in the

This instability condition can be satisﬁed for small values of H. For instance,
for M > 0.6, f (M 2) < 1 at (27). Further increasing M allows for smaller
values of H. For M = 5, one has H > 1/10 for instability, an inequality

the Langmuir soliton (9-10), M = 2√2E0, showing that large amplitude
solitons are more inﬂuenced by quantum instabilities. Figure 1 shows the
curve H 2 = f (M 2) separating stable-unstable regions.

The existence of quantum instabilities not present for the classical system
is a remarkable fact. It shows that the classical localized solution eventually
is smeared out, since the width of the Gaussian is continuously increasing in
time. This is a signature of wave-packet spreading and tunneling, because
the classical Langmuir soliton is produced by particle trapping in the self-
consistent electrostatic potential. Notice, however, that nonlinear eﬀects can
suppress the linear quantum instability.

Unlike the classical case [26], the system (20)-(22) seems to be not de-
scribed by a pseudo-potential function. This is due to the velocity depen-
dence on the dynamical equation for a(t). Nevertheless, using the energy
one can get a rough estimate for an escape velocity. In the limit

situation where the particle escapes, one has ˙a = ˙s = 0 when a

Once again, quantum eﬀects act in a tunneling-like manner.
Indeed, (28)
shows that a suﬃciently large value of H can produce escaping of the par-
ticle, no matter the value of the initial velocity ˙s0. The limiting value
H = (4/√7)M −1 for which ˙s0 = 0 can be achieved even for the semiclassic
case for suﬃciently high M. For instance, when M = 10, the particle even-
tually escapes for H > 0.15, a moderate value. A nonzero value of ˙a0 tends
to produce even smaller values of H for escaping.

Figures 2, 3 and 4 shows typical oscillations for the dynamical system
(20)-(22), with M = N = 3, H = 0.3. The initial condition is at the ﬁxed
point and ˙a(0) = 0. Also, ˙s0 = 0.62. For such parameters, simulations shows
unbounded motion for ˙s0 = 0.64, which is much less than the classical escape
velocity, ˙s0 = 0.73, and in good agreement with the critical value 0.59 arising

notice that quantum eﬀects leads to complicated trajectories even for equal
values of the invariants M and N, approaching the critical value of ˙s0 for
unbounded motion (see ﬁgure 4). Several other runs shows that increasing
the value of ˙s0 increases the period and the amplitude of the oscillations.
Direct comparison between the present simulations and those of the original
quantum Zakharov system will be reported in a future work.

4 Non perturbative full system

When H is not a small parameter, one is not allowed to solve (18) retaining
only the ﬁrst-order quantum correction. Therefore, one is left with the full
system (18)-(20), for which some conclusions can be obtained. Even for the
balanced case when M = N, it is not possible to get a closed-form solution
for the ﬁxed points, making diﬃcult to derive general statements about lin-
ear stability. However, simulations can be made for diﬀerent values of H,
starting from a ﬁxed point numerically calculated. For M = N = 1, H = 5,
an equilibrium is found for (κ, a, s) = (0, 9.15, 3.53). Figure 5 shows a typical
trajectory starting at this initial condition, with ˙s0 = 0.2. Under the same

increasing H it becomes more diﬃcult to get regular, quasi-periodic trajec-
tories, pointing for instabilities of quantum nature. In addition, unbounded
motion appears for smaller values of the initial velocity.

Further results on the rˆole of quantum eﬀects can be obtained for the
ultra-quantum case where we can neglect all terms at the right-hand sides of
(18)-(20) not containing H 2. In such case where H 2 is large enough, one get

inspection of (31) shows that the width b = s2 of the density ﬂuctuation
increases without bound, since ¨s =

H 2/2s6 having no bound-states. The results at the end of this section comes
from the rough procedure of disregarding all terms not containing H 2 in
the right-hand sides of (18)-(20). They are consistent with the previous
simulations, showing the destabilizing rˆole of quantum eﬀects.

5 Conclusion

The quantum Zakharov system was analyzed through a time-dependent Gaus-
sian trial function method for an associated Lagrangian formalism. This
extends to the quantum plasmas realm the results obtained for the classi-
cal Zakharov system by a similar approach [26]. In contrast to the classical
case, complicated trajectories and instabilities can be found even for the bal-
anced case of equal values of the invariants M and N, corresponding to the
low-frequency part of the mass and the number of high frequency quanta,
respectively. Quantum eﬀects plays a destabilizing rˆole, yielding the ulti-

14

mate decaying of the Langmuir soliton whose properties are simulated by
the time-dependent Gaussian ansatz. This is a signature of quantum eﬀects
(wave-packet spreading, tunneling), making more diﬃcult the existence of
coherent, localized solutions in quantum plasmas. Direct comparison be-
tween the variational solutions of this work and numerical simulations of the
original Zakharov system remains an open question.

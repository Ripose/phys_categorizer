Abstract

We describe a hybrid molecular dynamics approach for the description of
ultracold neutral plasmas, based on an adiabatic treatment of the electron
gas and a full molecular dynamics simulation of the ions, which allows us to
follow the long-time evolution of the plasma including the eﬀect of the strongly
coupled ion motion. The plasma shows a rather complex relaxation behavior,
connected with temporal as well as spatial oscillations of the ion temperature.
Furthermore, additional laser cooling of the ions during the plasma evolution
drastically modiﬁes the expansion dynamics, so that crystallization of the ion
component can occur in this nonequilibrium system, leading to lattice-like
structures or even long-range order resulting in concentric shells.

Introduction

Experiments in cooling and trapping of neutral gases have paved the way toward
a new parameter regime of ionized gases, namely the regime of ultracold neutral
plasmas (UNPs). Experimentally, UNPs are produced by photoionizing a cloud of
laser-cooled atoms collected in a magneto-optical trap [1], with temperatures down
to 10 µK. By tuning the frequency of the ionizing laser, initial electron kinetic
energies of Ee/kB = 1K − 1000K have been achieved. The time evolution of several
quantities characterizing the state of the plasma, such as the plasma density [1, 2, 3],
the rate of expansion of the plasma cloud into the surrounding vacuum [2], the
energy-resolved population of bound Rydberg states formed through recombination
[4], or electronic [5, 6] as well as ionic [3] temperature have been measured using
various plasma diagnostic methods.

Despite the low typical densities of ≈ 109 cm−3, the very low initial temperatures
suggest that these plasmas have been produced well within the strongly coupled
regime, with Coulomb coupling parameters up to Γe = 10 for the electrons and
even Γi = 30000 for the ions. Thus, UNPs seem to oﬀer a unique opportunity for
a laboratory study of neutral plasmas where, depending on the initial electronic
kinetic energy, either one component (namely the ions) or both components (ions
and electrons) may be strongly coupled. Moreover, the plasma is created in a
completely uncorrelated state, i.e. far away from thermodynamical equilibrium. The
relaxation of a strongly correlated system towards equilibrium is an interesting topic
in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and has been studied for decades. The history
of this problem must be traced back to the important contributions of Klimontovich
[7, 8, 9], who pointed out that kinetic energy conserving collision integrals such as
the Boltzmann, Landau and Lenard-Balescu collision integrals are not appropriate

1

for such a situation, and derived non-Markovian kinetic equations taking correctly
into account total energy conservation of the system. In the following years this
problem has attracted much attention and the relaxation of nonequilibrium strongly
coupled plasmas has been studied by a variety of diﬀerent methods [10, 11, 12,
13]. The very low densities of UNPs make it now possible to directly observe
the dynamical development of spatial correlations, which may serve as the ﬁrst
experimental check of the present understanding of the strongly coupled plasma
dynamics. Moreover, it turns out that the timescale of the plasma expansion,
the correlation time as well as the relaxation time of the ions are almost equal.
Therefore Bogoliubov’s functional hypothesis, usually used in kinetic theory, breaks
down under the present conditions, which may lead to a very interesting relaxation
behavior but also causes some diﬃculties in the theoretical description of these
systems, since the plasma dynamics can not be divided into diﬀerent relaxation
stages.

2 Theoretical approach

A full molecular dynamics simulation of ultracold neutral plasmas over experimen-
tally relevant timescales is infeasible with present-day computer resources due to
the large number of particles (N ≈ 105) and the long observation times (t ≈ 10−4
s) involved. In order to model the evolution of UNPs, we have developed a hybrid
molecular dynamics (HMD) approach which treats electrons and ions on diﬀerent
levels of sophistication, namely in a hydrodynamical approximation on the one hand
(for the electrons) and on a full molecular dynamics level on the other hand (for the
ions) [14]. For the electrons, it has been shown that several heating eﬀects, such
as continuum threshold lowering [15], build-up of correlations [16], and, predomi-
nantly, three-body recombination [17] rapidly increase the electronic temperature.
As a consequence, the electrons are always weakly coupled, Γe < 0.2, over the
whole course of the system evolution. Moreover, due to the small electron-to-ion
mass ratio, the relaxation timescale of the electrons is much smaller than that of
the ions as well as the timescale of the plasma expansion. Hence, an adiabatic ap-
proximation may safely be applied, assuming instant equilibration of the electrons.
This allows for the use of much larger timesteps than in a full MD simulation since
the electronic motion does not need to be resolved. It is this adiabatic approxi-
mation for the electrons which makes a molecular dynamics treatment of the ionic
motion in UNPs computationally feasible. The electronic density is determined self-
consistently from the Poisson equation. The fact that the potential well created by
the ions which is trapping the electrons has a ﬁnite depth is taken into account
by using a King-type distribution [18] known from simulations of globular clusters
rather than a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the electron velocities, with the
electronic temperature Te obtained from energy conservation. The ﬁnite well depth
also leads to evaporation of a fraction of the free electrons in the very early stage of
the plasma evolution, which is accounted for by determining the fraction of trapped
electrons from the results of [1]. The dynamics of the heavy particles is described
in the framework of a chemical picture, where inelastic processes, namely three-
body recombination and electron impact ionization, excitation and deexcitation,
are taken into account on the basis of Boltzmann-type collision integrals [19, 9],
with the transition rates taken from [20]. Numerically, the resulting collision in-
tegrals are evaluated using a Monte Carlo sampling as described in [21, 14, 22].
The ions and recombined atoms are then propagated individually in a molecular
dynamics simulation, taking into account the electronic mean-ﬁeld potential and

the full interaction potential of the remaining ions1. In order to allow for larger
particle numbers, the most time-consuming part of the HMD simulation, namely
the calculation of the interionic forces, is done using a treecode procedure originally
designed for astrophysical problems [23], which scales like Ni ln Ni rather than N 2
i
with the number Ni of ions.

As shown in several publications [14, 24, 25, 22], the HMD approach outlined
above provides a powerful method for the description of UNPs, taking full account
of ionic correlation eﬀects. However, due to the large numerical eﬀort involved, it
is limited to particle numbers of Ni ≈ 105. While this permits a direct simulation
of many, particularly of the early, experiments, an increasing number of experi-
ments is performed with larger particle numbers up to 107. Thus, an alternative
method which is able to treat such larger systems is desirable. Such a method is
indeed available [14], based on a hydrodynamical description of both electrons and
ions similar to that introduced in [17, 21]. Starting from the ﬁrst equation of the
BBGKY hierarchy, one obtains the evolution equations for the one-particle distri-
bution functions f of the electrons and ions. Neglecting again electron-electron as
well as electron-ion correlations, and employing the same adiabatic approximation
for the electrons already used in the HMD approach, a quasineutral approximation
[26] permits expressing the mean-ﬁeld electrostatic potential in terms of the ionic
density, leading to a closed equation for the ion distribution function which contains
the electron temperature as a parameter. A Gaussian ansatz for the ion distribution
function,

which corresponds to the initial state of the plasma cloud, is then inserted into
the evolution equations for the second moments hr2i, hrvi and hv2i of the ion dis-
tribution function. In this way, evolution equations for the width σ of the cloud,
the parameter γ of the hydrodynamical expansion velocity u = γr and the ionic
temperature Ti are obtained. Ionic correlations are taken into account in an approx-
imate way using a local density approximation together with a gradient expansion,
reducing the description of their inﬂuence on the plasma dynamics to the evolution
of a single macroscopic quantity, namely the correlation energy Uii of a homoge-
neous plasma. The relaxation behavior of Uii is modeled using a correlation-time
approximation [27] with a correlation time equal to the inverse of the ionic plasma
frequency, τcorr = ω−1
p,i , together with an analytical expression for the equilibrium
value of Uii [28]. Finally, inelastic processes such as three-body recombination and
electron impact ionization, excitation and deexcitation are incorporated on the ba-
sis of rate equations, and the inﬂuence of the recombined Rydberg atoms on the
expansion dynamics is taken into account assuming equal hydrodynamical velocities
1In order to bring out clearly the role of ionic correlations, it is also possible to neglect them
in the HMD approach by propagating the ions in the mean-ﬁeld potential created by all charges
rather than the full ionic interaction.

The preceeding hydrodynamical method is much more approximate than the
HMD approach, but, on the other hand, it is much simpler and quicker. For parti-
cle numbers of Ni ≈ 105, it requires about two orders of magnitude less CPU time.
Since its computational eﬀort is independent of the number of particles, it allows for
a simulation of larger plasma clouds corresponding to a number of current exper-
iments. Moreover, and maybe equally important, it provides physical insight into
the plasma dynamics since it is based on a few simple evolution equations for the
macroscopic observables characterizing the state of the plasma. As we have inves-
tigated in detail in [14], there is generally surprisingly good agreement between the
hydrodynamical simulation and the more sophisticated HMD calculation as long
as macroscopic, i.e. spatially averaged, quantities such as electronic temperature,
expansion velocity, ionic correlation energy etc. are considered. As an example, we
show in ﬁgure 1 the time evolution of the electronic temperature for a plasma of
40000 Sr ions with an initial average density of 109cm−3 and an initial electron
kinetic energy of 20 K, obtained from the HMD simulation (a) and from eqs. (2)

(b). During the whole system evolution, the agreement between the two simulation
methods is better than about 8%, and it becomes even better at later times. Thus,
we conclude that, for the present type of experimental setups, the hydrodynami-
cal method outlined above, and in particular the approximate treatment of ionic
correlations, is well suited for the description of the behavior of UNPs.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Comparison with experiments

In fact, ﬁg. 1 only shows good agreement between the two theoretical simulation
methods, without comparison with experiment. Such a comparison is now also
possible, since measurements of the electron temperature dynamics have recently
been reported in [5]. Fig. 2 shows the time evolution of the electronic tempera-
ture for a Xenon plasma with Ni(0) = 1.2 · 106, ρi(0) = 1.35 · 109cm−3 and two
diﬀerent initial temperatures of Te(0) = 66.67K and Te(0) = 6.67K. In addition
to the full hydrodynamical simulation according to equations (2), ﬁg. 2 also shows
corresponding calculations where the eﬀect of inelastic electron-ion collisions, eq.
(2e), is neglected (dashed lines). (The plasmas in these experiments are too large
For the high initial temperature,
to be simulated using the HMD approach.)
there is close agreement between the two corresponding simulations, showing that
inelastic processes are almost negligible in this case. Indeed, it is known that the
high-temperature plasma expansion is well described by the collisionless plasma
dynamics, and the hydrodynamical model is expected to accurately reproduce the
plasma dynamics in this regime. Since an overall systematic error of about 70% for
the temperature measurement has been reported in [5], we have exploited this fact
to calibrate the measured temperatures by scaling down both experimental data
sets by 26% in order to match the high-temperature results to our calculations. As
can be seen in the ﬁgure, there is excellent agreement between simulation and ex-

periment also for the lower temperature. (We stress that there is no further scaling
of the low-temperature data in order to achieve quantitative agreement, the same
calibration factor as in the high-temperature case is used.) In this case, inelastic
collisions play a decisive role for the evolution of the system. More speciﬁcally,
as has been found already in [17], three-body recombination heats the plasma and
signiﬁcantly changes its behavior, leading to a weakly coupled electron gas, as dis-
cussed above in connection with the omission of electronic correlation eﬀects in the
numerical treatment. Moreover, there has been some discussion in the literature
whether the collision rates of [20] would still be applicable at these ultralow tem-
peratures, or whether three-body recombination would be signiﬁcantly altered. The
close agreement between the present simulation and the experimental data in ﬁg. 2
suggests that the rates of [20], while ultimately diverging ∝ T −9/2
for Te → 0, still
adequately describe three-body recombination processes in the temperature range
under consideration.

As a second example, ﬁgure 3 shows the time evolution of the electronic density
for a Xenon plasma of 500000 ions with an initial average density of 109cm−3 and two
diﬀerent initial electron temperatures of Te(0) = 210K and Te(0) = 2.6K [2]. Again,
it can be seen that the model equations nicely reproduce the density evolution in
both temperature regimes, in agreement with [17] where it was shown that the low-
temperature enhancement of the expansion velocity [2] is caused by recombination
heating and is not due to strong-coupling eﬀects of the electrons.

3.2 Role of ionic correlations

Having thus established the validity of our numerical methods for the description
of UNPs, we can now turn to a more detailed investigation of the role of ionic cor-
relations in these systems. It is found that, for situations corresponding to the type
of experiments [1, 5, 6], they hardly inﬂuence the macroscopic expansion behavior
of the plasma. This becomes evident, e.g., in ﬁg. 1, where the “full” simulations as
described above (solid lines) are compared to a mean-ﬁeld treatment of the system
completely neglecting correlation eﬀects (dotted lines). The correlation-induced
heating of the ions [29, 30, 31] leads to a slightly faster expansion of the plasma,
which in turn results in a slightly faster adiabatic cooling of the electrons [14].
However, the overall eﬀect is almost negligible.

A closer look, on the other hand, reveals that certain aspects of the expansion
dynamics are indeed signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the strong ion-ion interaction, as can
be seen in ﬁgure 4. There, the spatial density of the ions is shown after t = 3 µs

for the same plasma as in ﬁg. 1. A mean-ﬁeld treatment of the particle interactions
[21] predicts that a shock front should form at the plasma edge, seen as the sharp
spike in ﬁg. 4 (dotted line). Apparently, with ionic correlations included (solid line)
the peak structure is much less pronounced than in mean-ﬁeld approximation. This
is due to dissipation caused by ion-ion collisions which are fully taken into account
in the HMD simulation. As shown in [32], by adding an ion viscosity term to the
hydrodynamic equations of motion, dissipation tends to stabilize the ion density
and prevents the occurrence of wavebreaking which was found to be responsible for
the diverging ion density at the plasma edge in the case of a dissipationless plasma
expansion. Furthermore, the initial correlation heating of the ions largely increases
the thermal ion velocities, leading to a broadening of the peak structure compared
to the zero-temperature case.

Another obvious aspect where ionic correlations play a dominant role is the
behavior of the ionic temperature. Considering the huge ionic coupling constants
suggested by the low initial ion temperatures, this temperature turns out to be
an important quantity since it directly determines the value of Γi. According to a
mean-ﬁeld treatment, the ions would remain the (near) zero temperature ﬂuid they
are initially. However, as has been pointed out before, the ions are created in a com-
pletely uncorrelated non-equilibrium state, and they quickly heat up through the
build-up of correlations as the system relaxes toward thermodynamical equilibrium.
As shown in [14], even at early times the ionic velocity distribution is locally well
described by a Maxwell distribution corresponding to a (spatially) local tempera-
ture, justifying the deﬁnition of a — due to the spherical symmetry of the plasma
— radius-dependent ion temperature Ti(r, t). Moreover, if the spatially averaged
temperature is identiﬁed with the ion temperature determined by the model equa-
tions (2) one can ﬁnd again good agreement between both approaches concerning
the timescale of the initial heating as well as the magnitude of the ion temperature,
even at later times [14]. However, as becomes apparent from ﬁg. 5, the HMD simula-
tions show temporal oscillations of the ionic temperature, which can, of course, not
be described by the linear ansatz of the correlation-time approximation. Such tem-
poral oscillations of the temperature during the initial relaxation stage are known
from molecular dynamics simulations of homogeneous one-component [13] and two-
component [33] plasmas, which are clearly caused by the strongly coupled collective

ion dynamics, since they increase in strength with increasing Γi and disappear for
Γi(0) < 0.5 [13].

Despite the fact that the maximum initial coupling constant used in [13] is
Γi = 5, while a value of Γi(0) ≈ 40000 is considered in the case of ﬁg. 5, the oscilla-
tions observed in [13] are much more pronounced and persist much longer than in
the present case. It becomes apparent that the rapid damping of the temperature
oscillations can be traced to the inhomogeneity of the Gaussian density proﬁle by
looking at the central part of the plasma only, where the ionic density is approxi-
mately constant (ﬁgure 6). The temperature oscillations with an oscillation period
of half of the inverse plasma frequency ν0 = ωp,i(0)/2π deﬁned in the central plasma
region are much more pronounced in this case, showing an exponential decay with a
characteristic damping rate of ν0 (ﬁg. 6(b)). The temporally and spatially resolved
temperature evolution shown in ﬁg. 7 shows that the radially decreasing ion density
leads to local temperature oscillations with radially increasing frequencies, thereby
causing also spatial oscillations of the local ion temperature. Therefore, the seem-
ingly enhanced damping rate, which has also been observed in recent experiments,
is purely an eﬀect of the averaging of these local oscillations over the total plasma

3.3 Coulomb crystallization through laser cooling

The above considerations show that, while not dramatically aﬀecting the overall
expansion behavior of the plasma cloud, strong-coupling eﬀects play an important
role in diﬀerent aspects of the evolution of UNPs. Thus, UNPs provide a prime ex-
ample of laboratory realizations of strongly nonideal plasmas. Moreover, the HMD
approach developed in [14] is well suited for an accurate description of these systems
over experimentally relevant timescales, allowing for direct comparison between ex-
periment and theory. Many interesting aspects of the relaxation behavior of these
non-equilibrium plasmas may thus be studied in great detail. However, while eﬀects
of strong ionic coupling become apparent in UNPs, the naively expected regime with
Γ > 100 can not be reached with the current experimental setups. For the elec-
trons, it is predominantly three-body recombination which heats them by several
orders of magnitude, so that Γe < 0.2 during the whole system evolution. The ionic
component, on the other hand, is heated by the correlation-induced heating until
Γi ≈ 1, i.e. just at the border of the strongly coupled regime [29, 3]. Thus, it is the
very build-up of ionic correlations one wishes to study that eventually shuts oﬀ the
process and limits the amount of coupling achievable in these systems.

As soon as the reason for this ionic heating became clear, several proposals have
been made in order to avoid or at least reduce the eﬀect, among them (i) using
fermionic atoms cooled below the Fermi temperature in the initial state, so that the
Fermi hole around each atom prevents the occurrence of small interatomic distances
[29]; (ii) an intermediate step of exciting atoms into high Rydberg states, so that
the interatomic spacing is at least twice the radius of the corresponding Rydberg
state [30]; and (iii) the continuous laser-cooling of the plasma ions after their initial
creation, so that the correlation heating is counterbalanced by the external cooling
[34, 24]. We have simulated the latter scenario using the HMD method, extended
to allow for the description of laser cooling, as well as elastic electron-ion collisions
which are negligible for the free plasma expansion but not necessarily in the laser-

to the ion equation of motion, where v is the ion velocity, ξ is a stochastic variable
with hξi = 0, hξ(t)ξ(t + τ )i = 3δ(τ ), and the cooling rate β and the correspond-
ing Doppler temperature Tc are determined by the properties of the cooling laser
[35]. Elastic electron-ion collisions are taken into account on the basis of the corre-
sponding Boltzmann collision integral, which is again evaluated by a Monte-Carlo
procedure [22].

It is found that laser cooling leads to qualitative changes of the plasma dynam-
ics. In particular, it signiﬁcantly decelerates the expansion of the plasma, whose
width is found to increase only as σ ∝ t1/4, in contrast to freely expanding plasmas
which behave as σ ∝ t. It is this drastic slow-down of the expansion which favors
the development of strong ion correlations, compared to a free plasma where the
expansion considerably disturbs the relaxation of the system. The simulations show
further that strongly coupled expanding plasmas can indeed be created under real-
istic conditions, with ionic coupling constants far above the crystallization limit for
homogeneous plasmas of Γi ≈ 174 [36]. Here we ﬁnd, depending on the initial con-
ditions, i.e. ion number and initial electronic Coulomb coupling parameter, strong
liquid-like short-range correlations or even the onset of a radial crystallization of
the ions. This is demonstrated in ﬁg. 8, showing the radial density and a central
slice of a plasma with Ni(0) = 80000, Γe(0) = 0.08, cooled with a damping rate
of β = 0.2ωp,i(0), at a scaled time of ωp,i(0)t = 216. The formation of concentric

shells in the center of the cloud is clearly visible. As illustrated in ﬁg. 9, beside the
radial ordering there is also signiﬁcant intra-shell ordering, namely a formation of
hexagonal structures on the shells, which are, however, considerably disturbed by
the curvature of the shells.

4 Conclusions

In summary, we have used an HMD approach to study the behavior of ultracold
neutral plasmas on long time scales. We have shown that eﬀects of strong interionic
coupling are indeed visible in such systems, e.g. most prominently in the relaxation
behavior of the ion temperature, which is connected with transient temporal as well
as spatial oscillations. Nevertheless, the strongly coupled regime of Γ > 100 is not
reached with the current experimental setups. We have demonstrated, however,
that additional continuous laser cooling of the ions during the plasma evolution
qualitatively changes the expansion behavior of the system and should allow for the
Coulomb crystallization of the plasma [24, 22]. It will be an interesting subject for
further investigation to study in detail the dynamics of this crystallization process,
which diﬀers from the shell structure formation observed in trapped nonneutral plas-
mas [36] as explained in [24]. In particular, the inﬂuence of the plasma expansion,
which presumably causes the transition from liquid-like short-range correlation to
the radial ordering, deserves more detailed studies. Other future directions include
the study of eﬀects induced by additional magnetic ﬁelds, or of ways to conﬁne the
plasma in a trap.

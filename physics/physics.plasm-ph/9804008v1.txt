Abstract

g → b3Σ+

For the ﬁrst time the emission of the radiative dissociation continuum of
the hydrogen molecule (a3Σ+
u electronic transition) has been used as
a source of information for the spectroscopic diagnostics of non-equilibrium
plasmas. It is shown that in the wavelength range λ = 220−400 nm the shape
of the continuum is sensitive to the ground X 1Σ+
g state vibrational tempe-
rature for Tvib = 2000 ÷ 8000 K. The absolute intensity of the continuum is
proposed to be used for an estimation of the rate of the electron impact dis-
sociation (d[H2]/dt)diss. General considerations are illustrated with examples
It was observed
of experiments in capillary-arc and microwave discharges.
in the H2+Ar plasma that the shape of the continuum depends on the ratio
of the mixture components. Absorption measurements of the population of
the 3s23p54s levels of Ar i together with certain computer simulations con-
ﬁrmed that the Ar*→H2 excitation transfer should be taken into account. In
our conditions (power ﬂux near microwave applicator windows: 4 W cm−2,
pressure p = 0.5 mbar) the following values were obtained for the microwave
discharge: Tvib <
∼ 3000 K, (d[H2]/dt)diss ≈ 1017 cm−3 s−1, typical contribu-
tions of the excitation transfer were 10-30% of the total population of the
a3Σ+

I. INTRODUCTION

g → b3Σ+

Experimental and theoretical studies of the emission of the H2 radiative dissociation
continuum (a3Σ+
u electronic transition) have a long and interesting history. They
were stimulated by molecular spectroscopy and quantum chemistry [1–7], investigations
of hydrogen containing plasmas [8–10] and astrophysics [11,12]. Since the ﬁrst work of
Houtermans [13] the a3Σ+
u transition has been studied as a possible laser system
(see [14–17] and Refs. herein). It is widely used in UV and VUV light sources [8,18–21].

g → b3Σ+

Various radiative and collisional elementary processes related to the phenomenon were
studied in numerous works (see below). At ﬁrst the kinetics of excitation-deactivation of
g , v′ vibronic states of H2 and D2 in plasma were studied on the basis of measurements
a3Σ+
of relative continuum intensities, electron energy distribution function F (ε) (by Langmuir
probes), and gas temperature in hollow cathode and capillary-arc discharges [9]. Simple
systems of the excitation-deactivation balance equations were used for the explanation of
well-known empiric phenomena: 1) the independence of the shape of the continuum on
discharge conditions, and 2) the diﬀerence between spectral distributions in H2 and D2
continua. This approach was later improved to be able to consider the continuum intensity
It was found that the knowledge of radiative and collisional
in an absolute scale [10].
transition probabilities together with accurate measurements of F (ε) makes it possible to
calculate the intensities in hydrogen low-pressure plasma with an accuracy of 20-30%, which
is acceptable for practical purposes. As far as we know, the H2 continuum emission was never
used or proposed to be used for a determination of plasma parameters, i. e., for spectroscopic
plasma diagnostics.

The experimental data contain two diﬀerent sources of information: the relative spec-
tral distribution and the total absolute intensity of the continuum. In the absence of self-
absorption the ﬁrst one is directly connected with the population density distribution over
vibrational levels of the a3Σ+
g state. In low pressure plasmas the levels are populated pre-
dominantly by direct electron impact excitation and the deactivation is mainly due to spon-
taneous emission. In this case the relation between the vibrational population density distri-
butions in excited and ground electronic states may be obtained within corona-like models
[9]. So the shape of the continuum may be used for a determination of the vibrational
density distribution of the ground state of H2 in non-equilibrium plasmas.

On the other hand every act of the continuum emission leads to a dissociation of a
hydrogen molecule. Therefore, an absolute value of the continuum intensity is in principle
connected with the rate of radiative dissociation via the a3Σ+
g state and also may be used
for an estimation of the rate of electron impact dissociation. The main goal of this paper
is to investigate both opportunities and to check them experimentally. Some preliminary
results were already reported in [22].

II. INTENSITIES OF H2 BANDS AND VIBRATIONAL TEMPERATURE

The dissociation continuum of the hydrogen molecule is caused by spontaneous transi-
tions from the upper bound a3Σ+
u repulsive state. The
spectral distribution Iab(λ) of the continuum intensity (number of quanta emitted within

g electronic state to the lower b3Σ+

2

unit range of wavelengths per unit volume and per second) is related to the population
densities Nav′ of the excited a3Σ+

g , v′ vibronic levels, as

where v′ – vibrational quantum number,

Iab(λ) =

g , v′, N ′
the total population density of the upper vibronic state, Nav′N ′ – populations of a3Σ+
electronic-vibro-rotational levels (their very small triplet splitting may be neglected), N ′ –
rotational quantum number of the total angular momentum excluding electron spin, and
Aav′
b (λ) – spectral distribution of the spontaneous emission transition probability (Einstein
coeﬃcients for various wavelengths of a3Σ+
u transitions). We have neglected the
rather small eﬀect of vibro-rotation interaction and assume the transition probabilities being
independent on N ′.

g , v′ → b3Σ+

For H2 molecules the values of Aav′

b (λ) should be considered as well-known nowadays
because they have been calculated in several works [1,5–7,14] and checked experimentally
[4], being in rather good agreement [7]. We used the results of [6,7] shown in Table I.
These are the only data presented in table form suitable for applications.
In Fig. 1 the
g , v′=0-3 levels for λ = 200 − 450 nm. The
data are visualized for the transitions from a3Σ+
probability of transitions from various vibronic levels has maxima in diﬀerent wavelength
regions due to oscillations of the vibrational wave functions of the upper state. So the
spectral distribution of the continuum intensity Iab(λ) has a certain informational content
about the population density distribution over vibrational levels of the a3Σ+
g electronic state.
In principle, measurements of the intensity Iab(λ) may be used for the determination of the
populations Nav′ in relative or even in absolute scale by Eq. (1).

It should be noted that even this very ﬁrst stage of the data processing belongs to the
class of so-called reverse (or inversion) problems, which are known to be not well posed
(sometimes they are called “ill-posed”). The ﬁnal result – a certain set of the populations
Nav′ – depends (in principle) not only on the values of the actual populations in the plasma,
but may be inﬂuenced by so-called a priory information: the number of adjusted parameters
(Nav′), the number of experimental data points, the experimental errors and the algorithm
used.

In the present work we used for the solution of this and other reverse problems the

least-square ﬁtting, i. e., the minimization of the functional

λi was varied in the range 220 − 400 nm. Experimental errors were estimated by averaging
of several measurements for the same conditions of the plasma. They are mainly caused by
random noise, non-suﬃcient stability of the discharges during the experiments and restricted
reproducibility. The value of v′
max had to be adjusted in such a way that reliable results can
be obtained from the minimization procedure. The values of Aav′
b (λ) were interpolated by
cubic splines from Table I.

Values of Nav′ may be sometimes interesting themselves (see the examples below). But
on the other hand, in non-equilibrium plasmas the rovibronic level populations in excited
electronic states are connected with those in the ground electronic state [24]. Under certain
conditions they may be used for the spectroscopic determination of vibrational [9,25] and
rotational temperatures [26–28].
In the present work we were able to measure also the
u , v′=0-5,N ′=1-5 rovibronic levels by the Q–branch lines of
populations Ndv′N ′ of the d3Π−
the Fulcher-α bands. For further analysis let us consider the excitation-deactivation balance
equation for the electronically excited n′, v′, N ′ rovibronic level which may be written as

For plasma diagnostics the most simple limit case (often called corona or corona-like
model) is that of low-pressure plasmas with small input power. Under such conditions the
levels are predominantly excited by direct electron impact excitation and their decay is
mainly due to spontaneous emission. An additional population of the a3Σ+
g state due to
cascades from e3Σ+
u states was taken into account in [10] and found to be less
than 20%. The radiative and collisional quenching lifetimes are estimated to be equal at 3
mbar for a3Σ+

g and at 0.75 mbar for d3Π−

u states (see [10,29]).

g and d3Π−

It may be seen from Eqs. (2) and (3) that even in the most favorable case for plasma
diagnostics the populations Nn′v′N ′ depend not only on the distribution NXvN . Radiative
transition probabilities, lifetimes and electron impact cross sections for single rovibronic
levels and transitions should be known as well as the electron energy distribution function.
Moreover the determination of NXvN from measured Nn′v′N ′ and certain system of equations
(2) for various v′ and N ′ lead to a reverse problem.

u , v′, N ′=1 → a3Σ+

The transition probabilities for d3Π−

g , v′′, N ′′=1 transitions [Q1 lines
of Fulcher-α bands (d3Π−
g electronic transition)] were obtained semiempirically in
the framework of the adiabatic approximation from experimental data about wave numbers,
branching ratios in v′′-progressions and radiative lifetimes [30]. The results for the ﬁrst seven
diagonal (v′=v′′=v) bands are presented in Table II together with semiempirically predicted
[30] and experimental values of radiative lifetimes [28,29].

u → a3Σ+

One may see a noticeable discrepancy between semiempirical and experimental lifetimes
u , v′=4-6, N ′=1 rovibronic levels due to non-adiabatic eﬀects neglected in the adia-
of d3Π−
batic approximation (see also [10,29]). Therefore, only the ﬁrst four diagonal bands may be
used for the determination of Tvib. On the other hand this eﬀect did not inﬂuence the values
u , v′ >3 levels in [28]. It
of the rotational temperatures derived from the populations of d3Π−
may be considered as an indication, that the rate of the additional decay, associated with a
non-adiabatic coupling of the vibronic levels lying above the H(n=1) + H(n=2) dissociation
limit, is almost independent on N ′ (here n is the principle quantum number). It seems quite
reasonable, if the perturbation is due to an electron-rotational interaction with a continuum
(the hypothesis proposed in [31]). Because of the lack of information about N ′–dependences
of the transition probabilities and the lifetimes they are considered as independent on the
rotational quantum number in accordance with an adiabatic approximation.

The radiative lifetimes of a3Σ+

g , v′ vibronic states of H2 have been studied in nume-
rous works both experimentally [2,3,12,32–34] and by ab initio calculations [1,5]. All avai-
lable data are collected in Table III. One may see, that: (1) Nothing is known about
N ′–dependences of the lifetimes, so we have to assume independence on N ′. (2) Experimen-
tal data are obtained only for low vibronic states. (3) The experimental and calculated data
are in very good accordance for v′=0-2, but for higher v′ only ab initio data are available.
To be in consistence with the transition probabilities listed in, Table I, we used values
of τav′ marked in Table III as “p.w.”. The lifetimes for v′=0-2 were obtained by integration
of the tabulated values of probability. The values labeled with an asterisk for v′=3-6 were
obtained by extrapolating the lifetimes with the help of a third order polynomial ﬁt of the
data from [5] and a constant factor obtained from the average value of the ratios with our
values for τav′ and v′=0-2. This was necessary because for v′ >2 one can see in Table I
that some quantity of transition probability resides below the lower table margin of λ =
160 nm. Therefore, the calculation of the τav′ from the tabulated Aav′
b (λ) values leads to an
overestimation of the lifetimes.
The dependences of d3Π−

g ,0,N electron impact excitation on incident
electron energy have been studied in [35–37]. For singlet-triplet transitions they have normal
form: a sharp increase from the threshold to the maximum and a rather sharp decrease for
higher energies. The data of [35,37] are in good accordance and they were used for the
extraction of the cross sections for diﬀerent v′ from measured rate coeﬃcients and F (ε) in
[9]. The relative cross sections σdv′1
X01 in maximum are shown in Table IV together with
corresponding ratios of the Franck-Condon factors calculated in [38]. One may see noticeable
deviation of measured values from those calculated in the Franck-Condon approximation.
This discrepancy was interpreted as an evidence of a remarkable dependence of the scattering
amplitude on the internuclear distance (non-Franck-Condon eﬀect). The data from [9] have
been used for the determination of the complete set of the cross sections for various v, v′
and N, N ′ [39].

It is important to take into account that the relative cross sections in [9] are based on
radiative transition probabilities and lifetimes obtained in adiabatic approximation (almost
the same as in Table IV). As we already mentioned above the lifetimes of v′=4-6 are in
contradiction with such extrapolation. New data about τdv′1 [29] and Adv′1
av′′1 [30] should be
used for the determination of the cross sections from the line intensities measured in [9]. We
made the recalculation and got the data presented in the sixth column of Table IV. One
may see that they are in rather good agreement with corresponding ratios of Franck-Condon

This was recently conﬁrmed by ab initio calculations [40].

Nothing is known, so far as we know, about the cross sections for the a3Σ+

g , v′, N ′ ←

we assume that the rate coeﬃcients of electron impact excitation only for N ′ = N rovi-

Vibrational and rotational energies are not well separated in the ground electronic state

tional levels of the X 1Σ+

Taking into account all the assumptions discussed above, the balance equation (4) may

To be able to work with relative intensities we may introduce the normalized relative

which is equal to unity for λ = λ0.

The normalized intensities (12) may be tabulated for various values of Tvib and then may
be used for a determination of the vibrational temperature by least squares ﬁtting (3) of
experimental and calculated continuum intensity distributions.

The results of such calculation for λ0 = 400 nm and v′

The ratio

may also be calculated for various values of the vibrational temperature and then be used as a
nomogram for the determination of Tvib from measured relative continuum intensity without
solving the inverse problem by a minimization of Eq. (3). The results of such calculations
for a limited number of Tvib = 2000 − 8000 K are shown in Fig. 2. One may see that the
ratio (15) has some sensitivity to the vibrational temperature especially near 300 nm. For
this particular wavelength we may organize a graph of J ′
ab(λ = 300 nm, λ0 = 400 nm, Tvib)
versus Tvib presented in Fig. 3 where the sensitivity is even more clear. This dependence may
be used as a nomogram too, being especially useful for in situ control of plasmachemical
processes.

III. MEASUREMENTS

A. Experimental setup

The experiments in pure hydrogen and H2+Ar plasmas were carried out in two diﬀerent

gas discharges.

The ﬁrst one (USSR standard spectral lamp DVS-25) is a hot cathode arc with 2 mm
diameter constriction analogous to those used in [19,20]. The discharge device was ﬁlled with
8 mbar of spectrally pure hydrogen. The range of the discharge current I = 10 − 300 mA
allowed us to achieve rather high current densities j = 0.3 − 9.6 A/cm2.

The second plasma source was a H2+Ar microwave discharge excited by a planar mi-
crowave applicator similar to that described in [42]. The inner dimensions of the discharge
vessel are 15×21×120 cm3 and the area of the quartz microwave windows was 8×40 cm2.
The microwave power was fed in by a generator (SAIREM, GMP 12 KE/D, 2.45 GHz).
We were able to measure the total input (W ) and reﬂected power, the latter was in our
conditions (W = 1.5 kW) always negligible (< 4%). The input power ﬂux in the plane of
the applicator windows was roughly estimated to about 4 W/cm2 assuming 20% heat loss to
coolant and environment. Gas ﬂow controllers and a butterﬂy valve in the gas exhaust allow
to have an independent control of gas inﬂow (ϕ = 100 sccm) and pressure (p = 0.5-5 mbar).
The purity of gases was 99.996%.

The central part of the plasma along the axis of the capillary discharge was focused
by a quartz achromatic lens onto the entrance slit of a monochromator. In the microwave
plasma the line of sight was 12 mm below the microwave windows of the applicator. For
measurements of the continuum intensity we used a 0.5 m Czerny-Turner monochromator
(Acton Research Corporation Spectra Pro–500) with a grating of 600 grooves per mm in
the ﬁrst order. The line intensities however were measured using a high resolution 1 m
double monochromator of Czerny-Turner type with 1800 grooves per mm (Jobin Yvon RA-
MANOR U1000) in the ﬁrst order. The output light was detected by a CCD matrix detector
(TE-cooled, 512×512 pixel, size of image zone: 9.7×9.7 mm2) of the Optical Multichannel
Analyzer PARC OMA IV connected with a 40 MHz 486DX computer.

The wavelength calibration was done by means of known Ar lines observed in the H2+Ar
microwave plasma. Special software made it possible to collect and analyze the recorded
spectra.

The relative spectral sensitivity of the spectroscopic system in the range λ = 200−450 nm
has been obtained using a deuterium lamp (Heraeus Noble Light DO651MJ) calibrated
by the Physikalisch–Technische Bundesanstalt (Braunschweig). The absolute value of the
sensitivity for λ = 350 nm was determined with a tungsten ribbon lamp.
Its current-
temperature calibration has been performed by the Russian State Institute of Standards
(St.-Petersburg). We used two diﬀerent currents corresponding to the absolute temperatures
of tungsten T = 2637 and 2763 K. This gave us usually a spread in the values of the sensitivity
(at λ = 350 nm) of less than 1%. The emissivity coeﬃcient of the tungsten ribbon for these
temperatures was taken from [43] and used for the calculation of the spectral distribution
of emission intensity.

Some typical experimental records of the spectra of a standard deuterium lamp (a), pure
hydrogen capillary-arc discharge (b) and a H2+Ar plasma of the microwave discharge (c)

8

are presented in Fig. 4. The non-monotonic structure in the range λ = 250 − 350 nm is
connected with the spectral distribution of the sensitivity. In the long-wavelength end of
the ﬁrst two records the band (actually multiline) spectra of D2 and H2 molecules may be
seen. One may see also that in spite of the gas ﬂow mode our microwave plasma is not
spectrally pure. It contains some impurities: oxygen (283 nm), OH-radical (bands at 283,
310 − 320 nm), NH-radical (336 nm) and N2 molecule (bands of the 2nd positive system
280 − 400 nm mixed with H2 bands). It should be noted that some lines are overexposed in
the record shown in Fig. 4(c). The data of the continuum intensity were manually extracted
from the measured intensity distribution.

B. Pure hydrogen DC capillary-arc discharge

The relative continuum intensity and Q-branch lines of Fulcher-α bands were measured
in the current range mentioned above. The shape of the continuum was observed to be
independent on the current within the experimental errors. A typical result used in further
analysis is presented in Fig. 5. The low wavelength margin is limited by a sharp decrease of
the sensitivity of our spectrometrical system.

To ﬁnd the optimum number of adjusted parameters we made a χ2 minimization [Eq. (3)]
with various m = (v′
max + 1). The results of the calculations, made for the experimental data
of Fig. 5, are presented in Table VII. χ2 shows a monotonic decrease and becomes lower
than unity for v′
max ≥ 3. Another characteristic, presented in the table, is

ρmax = max (ρi) with ρi =

where Φi = ZiiZ −1
ii

q
and Zlk =

1 − 1/Φi,
∂2(χ2)
∂al∂ak

.

The magnitudes ρi are characteristics of the precision of the solution. Its zero value corre-
sponds to the limit case of total independence of the parameters, while ρi=1 means that the
parameter ai may be expressed as a linear combination of the other parameters and therefore
the number of adjusted parameters should be decreased. It may be seen from Table VII
that in our case ρmax is growing with the increase of m; ρmax is near to 1 for v′

max >3.

The maximum value of the relative standard deviation of the parameters (∆Nav′/Nav′)max
(in our case usually observed for v′=v′
max for
v′
max=0-3, then it jumps to about 0.83 at v′=4 and becomes much bigger for v′=5,6.
It

its optimal value.

Taking into consideration the results of Table VII we came to the conclusion that in our
case a determination of the populations of more than four vibronic levels is meaningless.
The reason is very simple and may be seen from Table VIII where the relative popula-
tions Nav′/Na0 (obtained for v′

From the data in Table VIII it becomes clear that only 4% of the detected emission quanta
originate from levels with v′ > 3. The populations Nav′ observed in the pure hydrogen
capillary-arc discharge are quite close to those calculated in the framework of our simple
model with Tvib →0.

To illustrate the correspondence between experimental and calculated relative continuum
intensities we present data of our calculations on Fig. 5. The intensity calculated by Eq. (14)
(the case of Tvib →0) gives practically the same quality of the experimental data as that
calculated by Eq. (1) with values of the Nav′ from Table VIII in the wavelength range under
the study. Below the short-wavelength margin diﬀerences appear between the calculations
made with v′

Furthermore, the ﬁrst ﬁve Q-branch lines of Fulcher-α diagonal bands (d3Π−

with v′=0-5, N ′=1-5) were used to obtain the vibrational and gas temperatures for various
discharge currents I by means of the method described above with a system of Eqs. (9) and
(10) (see also [24,28]). The results are presented in Fig. 6. Note that our values of the gas
temperature are in excellent agreement with those measured in [44] plotted also in Fig. 6.
One may see a certain growth of both Tvib and T with an increase of the discharge current
caused by a corresponding increase of the electron density and power input. Fulcher-α band
intensities show a remarkable diﬀerence between Tvib and T analogous to that observed by
CARS in [45]. On the other hand we tried to use the nomogram of Fig. 2 for a determination
of the vibrational temperature. We plotted the experimental ratios J ′
ab(λ, λ0, Tvib) on that
ﬁgure as well. The experimental uncertainties of the ratio are too big. We can only estimate
the upper limit of Tvib < 3000 K. Moreover, there were no observable changes of the shape
of the dissociation continuum within the range of the discharge current under the study.
Taking into account the rather strong assumptions made in our excitation model we have
to say that both spectroscopic methods are in fair agreement.

C. Microwave discharge in H2+Ar mixture

The spectral intensity distribution of the continuum in the H2+Ar microwave discharge
has a noticeably diﬀerent shape compared to that in pure hydrogen. Moreover, the shape
was found to depend on the ratio of the components in the mixture ([Ar]:[H2]), which
was changed from (19:1) to (1:4) under the same total pressure and power input. As an
illustration some typical results are shown in Fig. 7. Here only the both limit cases of the
(4:1) and (1:4) mixture are given. Note that measurements in between exhibit a monotonic
dependence of the increased emission in the wavelength range around 300 nm. An analysis
of various possible explanations of the observed phenomenon lead us to the assumption that
an excitation transfer from excited Ar atoms to the hydrogen molecules might take place.

1. Ar*→H2 excitation transfer

Excitation transfer in collisions of metastable (3P◦

1) Ar i
atoms with hydrogen molecules is known since the pioneer work of Lyman [46] and was
investigated so far in plasma and beam experiments mainly as: 1) quenching of excited Ar
and 2) additional excitation of VUV Lyman and Werner bands (B1Σ+

of H2. The ﬁrst attempts to study the role of this eﬀect in the emission of the hydrogen
dissociation continuum in H2+Ar plasmas appeared quite recently [22,47–49].

u → a3Σ+

The intensities of atomic hydrogen Balmer lines, Q-branch lines of Fulcher-α diagonal
bands (d3Π−
g ) and the continuum in the wavelength range λ = 200 − 400 nm have
been measured in the active phase and in the afterglow of the hollow cathode discharge in
pure hydrogen and its mixture with Ar (inner cathode diameter 6 mm, discharge currents
10 − 100 mA, total pressures about 1.5 mbar and Ar fraction in the mixture 20 − 80%)
[47–49]. The experimental setup was almost the same as in [50].

It was observed that the increase of the Ar content in H2+Ar mixture leads to: 1)
an approximately linear growth of the total continuum intensity per H2 molecule; 2) a
remarkable change in the shape of the spectral distribution of the continuum intensity [48].
The rectangular pulsed discharge mode was used for more or less independent variation on
the gas temperature and for the measurement of the time-decay curves for the H2 continuum,
(0-0) Q1, Q3 Fulcher-α lines of H2, and Ar i (λ = 750.3 nm) line. It was found that: (1)
Within experimental errors the shape of the continuum is independent of the gas temperature
in the range T = 300 − 800 K. (2) In the pure hydrogen discharge the time-decay of atomic
and molecular hydrogen emissions coincides with that of the discharge current (the rear
edge about 5 µs). (3) The time-decay of Fulcher-α and Ar i lines in a H2+Ar mixture is
also in coincidence with the time behavior of the discharge current while the H2 continuum
shows signiﬁcantly slower exponential decay with a characteristic time depending on the
ratio between the components in the mixture (about 15 µs) [47,49].

The last observation is a direct evidence for the existence of some additional (to the
electron impact) excitation process leading to the continuum emission in the wavelength
range under the study. The resulting spectral intensity distributions in H2+Ar mixtures
may be ﬁtted (with χ2=0.8-1.2) as a superposition of a3Σ+
g , v=0 electron impact
excitation (of the v′=0-5 vibronic levels) and additional excitation of the a3Σ+
g , v′=0 vibronic
level. The relative contribution of the last one is approximately proportional to the relative
content of Ar in the H2+Ar mixture [48,49].

g , v′ ← X 1Σ+

An analysis of various possible mechanisms [49] shows that we have observed the exci-
tation transfer from excited Ar* atoms to the ground state H2 molecule. It may go through
two diﬀerent ways:

(19)

Here (ArH2)* denotes a temporary state of the system during the interaction, T0 and T1, T2
are the initial and ﬁnal kinetic energies of reacting particles in the mass center frame. The
branching ratio between these two output channels of the reaction should depend on the
initial excited state of the Ar atom and the vibro-rotational state of the molecule as well as
on the collision energy T0. As far as we know it is not established up to now in spite of a
certain attempt in crossed beam experiments [4].

It may be shown, that if one wants to consider the excitation transfer possibility for
J argon atoms with various J values from the energy point of view, the existence of

where Im and I0 – the line intensities measured with and without the mirror, l – length of
plasma column along the axis of observation, r – the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the mirror and
S(x) – the Ladenburgh-L´evy function calculated by formulas from [52].

The reﬂection coeﬃcient has been determined experimentally by the measurement of
several Ar i lines (603.1, 703.0, 714.7, 789.1, 860.6, 862.0, and 876.1 nm) which are free of
self-absorption. It was found to be r = 0.52 ± 0.02 and independent on λ. We used the
values of the oscillator strengths from [53].

The intensities of two or three diﬀerent spectral lines were used for the population density

determination of every 3s23p54s level, namely:

826.452, 840.821 nm.

The conditions were the same as those in the measurements of the continuum intensity.

Typical results are shown in Fig. 8. The scaled populations are absolute values of the level
population densities divided by their statistical weights (2J + 1). They have the meaning
of the average populations of the multiplet structure sublevels. In equilibrium conditions
they should be almost equal to each other because the levels have almost the same energy –

1. The populations of various sublevels of all resonant and metastable states coincide
within the experimental errors. It is a direct manifestation of long eﬀective lifetimes
of the resonant levels (self-absorption of resonant emission) and a high enough rate
of collisional transitions between the 3s23p54s levels. So the metastable and resonant
levels of Ar i are actually mixed in the plasma under the study.

2. The sublevel populations show a monotonic decreasing dependence on the total pres-
sure which may be connected with: a decrease in the rate coeﬃcient of electron impact
excitation, an increase of collisional quenching and a possible decrease of microwave
power applied to the plasma.

3. The total population of all 12 sublevels may reach 1011 cm−3 at low pressures. The
rate coeﬃcients of the Ar*→H2 excitation transfer are approximately 10−10 cm3 s−1
[16]. Thus the rate of the continuum excitation in the reaction is about 1016 cm−3 s−1.
This is comparable with the observed total continuum emission (see Table IX) and
should be taken into account together with direct electron impact excitation of the
a3Σ+

g state of H2.

Let us assume that the spectral distribution of the model continuum intensity may be

presented as independent terms corresponding to three diﬀerent excitation mechanisms:

ab (λ) = A[c1Iab(λ, 0) + c2I a0
I calc

b (λ) + c3IArH(λ)],

(23)

where A – absolute scale normalization constant equal to total continuum intensity in the
range of observation λ = 225 − 400 nm, Iab(λ, 0) – spectral distribution of the continuum
radiation caused by the electron impact excitation of H2 from lowest X 1Σ+
g , v=0 vibronic
b (λ) – the same due to the reaction (19a) for v′=0 only, IArH(λ)
ground state [Eq. (14)], I a0
– the spectral distribution corresponding to the reaction (19b) calculated in [4], ci – the
i ci = 1). The spectral
coeﬃcients representing relative contributions of the components (
distributions Iab(λ, 0), I a0
b (λ) and IArH(λ) where normalized for unit area in the range of
wavelengths λ = 225 − 400 nm.

P

Then the spectral distributions of the continuum measured in the microwave plasma
under various conditions were ﬁtted by the function (23) according to Eq. (3). Typical
results are presented in Table IX for ﬁve selected mixtures of Ar+H2 from (1:4) up to (19:1).
The ﬁrst set of χ2-minimizations marked as (c1, c2, c3 6= 0) is made without any additional
conditions. One may see that the observed shape of the continuum may be described by
three adjusted parameters of the expansion (23) with rather good precision (χ2 = 1 − 2).
Moreover the ﬁttings show a negligible contribution of the reaction (19b), which cannot be
considered as signiﬁcant because the values of c3 are comparable with standard deviations
of their determination. Figure 9 illustrates typical results of such a ﬁtting. The contribution
of the reaction (19b) is too small to be visible in the ﬁgure.

The second set of ﬁttings was performed under the additional condition c3 = 0. This
version of the model provides almost the same precision in the description of the observed
spectra taking into account only the ﬁrst two mechanisms included into Eq. (23).

In contrast the third set of ﬁttings was carried out for c2 = 0 thus neglecting a contribu-
tion of the reaction (19a). Again we got almost the same quality of ﬁtting. These results are

13

the direct consequence of the similarity of spectral distributions of the continuum emission
caused by the reactions (19a) for v′=0 and (19b).

It should be noted, that ab initio potential curves of ArH* where never checked experi-
mentally and the spectral distribution of the ArH continuum was calculated in [4] in rough
approximation of a harmonic oscillator. The precision of such calculations cannot be high
nowadays. Taking this into account we may assume that the insigniﬁcant contribution of
the reaction (19b) obtained in the ﬁrst set of ﬁttings is an accidental numerical result. Most
probably it is without any physical meaning because two other sets [based on directly oppo-
site assumptions about branching ratio between reactions (19a) and (19b)] gave us almost
the same χ2 values.

Therefore, we have to conclude that the precision and the wavelength range of our
measurements together with the lack of dependable ArH* transition probabilities do not
allow us to distinguish contributions of the reactions (19a) and (19b). On the other hand,
there is no doubt that in our conditions the role of the Ar*→H2 excitation transfer is well
noticeable (10-30%).

2. Estimation of the rate of electron impact dissociation

As it was already mentioned in the introduction, the absolute value of the intensity of the
continuum is directly connected with the rate of the radiative dissociation via spontaneous
emission to the repulsive b3Σ+
u state. If absorption in the plasma volume may be neglected,
then the rate of radiative dissociation due to a3Σ+
u transitions is equal to the total
continuum intensity (expressed in number of photons per cm3 in a second) integrated over
the entire wavelength range

The wavelength range where we were able to measure the intensity was limited (see
Fig. 4, 5, 7). So we detected only a part of the continuum emission. (Measurements in
VUV are possible in principle, but they are not typical in most gas discharge and plasma
technology applications due to their technical complexity and the diﬃculties in the sensitivity
calibration and the spatial resolution.) The rest should be obtained by some extrapolation.
In pure hydrogen discharge plasma the vibrational temperature is usually rather low and
the Eqs. (1) and (12) may be used for the extrapolation. Two examples calculated with
v′
max=3 and v′
max=6 are presented in Fig. 5 together with experimental data. One may see,
that in our case: (1) The dependence of the total intensity (area under the curve) on the
v′
max is insigniﬁcant after v′
max became high enough. (2) The contribution of the undetected
part of the spectrum is rather signiﬁcant (about 60% in the example).

The other, more general way of treating of spectroscopic data is a numerical solution of
the reverse problem by χ2-minimization (3). The relative or absolute populations Nav′ thus
obtained may be used for the determination of the relative or absolute radiative dissociation
rate. Radiative lifetimes are known, so an integration over wavelengths is not necessary and
the procedure is reduced to only few summations in Eq. (24).

14

g ← X 1Σ+

In low-pressure gas discharges the upper levels of the continuum transition are predomi-
nantly populated by a3Σ+
g electron impact excitation. A dissociation of hydrogen
molecules is also mainly caused by electron impact excitation of various intermediate excited
electronic states, bound and repulsive ones. The relative contribution of various channels
to the total electron impact dissociation cross section σdiss(ε) was analyzed in [54], later
supplemented with an application of the close-coupling calculations of the cross-sections
[55]. It was found that singlet-triplet transitions play the major role, b3Σ+
g and
a3Σ+
g being most prominent. The experimental data for σdiss(ε) are available from
[56].

u ← X 1Σ+

g ← X 1Σ+

All these cross-sections seem to have a rather similar shape as a function of the collision
energy ε, except in the small region near the threshold, because an excitation of various
electronic states obviously has diﬀerent start-up energies. In [22] we proposed to use average
values of ratios between the cross sections (determined far enough from threshold region)
for the estimation of the rate of the radiationless b3Σ+
g process (d[H2]/dt)b←X and
the total dissociation rate (d[H2]/dt)diss by multiplication of the measured total continuum
intensity with certain coeﬃcients, namely 4 and 15 correspondingly. Actually, the coeﬃcients
depend on the shape of the electron energy distribution function, for example, the total
electron impact dissociation rate

(25)

Generally, the rate coeﬃcients in (25) should be calculated with actual F (ε) by Eq. (7)
[9,10].
If the distribution function is not available like in our present study, only rough
estimations are possible. It is quite obvious that, when ε-dependences of the cross-sections
have similar shapes, the ratio of the rate coeﬃcients is less sensitive to the near-threshold
region for F (ε) with a high content of fast enough electrons. To check the tendency we
calculated the ratios for a Maxwellian distribution with an electron temperature of Te=1-
10 eV and the cross sections from [55,56]. The results are presented in Fig. 10. One
may see that both ratios show sharp decrease for Te < 5 eV becoming almost independent
from Te for Te > 5 eV. It is quite typical for a low-pressure hydrogen discharge plasma to
have a strongly non-Maxwellian F (ε) with a high density of fast electrons having energies
suﬃciently higher than the thresholds (see i.e. [57]). So we may use the asymptotics of
Fig. 10 for the estimations. Numerical values of the coeﬃcients are

αb←X

and

∼ 16.

(26)

In the pure hydrogen capillary-arc discharge we were not able to carry out absolute
measurements because the plasma is inhomogeneous along the axis of observation and the
eﬀective length of the emitting plasma column is uncertain [57].

However, in the H2+Ar microwave plasma the length of emitting column (l ± ∆l) is well
deﬁned and absolute continuum intensities were measured in a certain range of discharge
conditions. But the Eqs. (24) and (26) are not valid any more, because Ar*→H2 excitation
transfer plays an important role. The continuum intensity may be expressed as (23) and the
total dissociation rate is a sum of the terms corresponding to the electron impact and the
excitation transfer. It can be shown that in this case the total dissociation rate

Spectral distributions of the intensities in the second and third terms are mainly located in
the wavelength range of our observations (about 90%). Only the ﬁrst one, connected with
a3Σ+
g v=0 excitation needs the extrapolation described above. Therefore, the
total dissociation rate in our conditions may be calculated from the measured continuum
intensity. The results are shown in Fig. 11(a,b) for various pressures and ratios of the
components in the mixture. They may be interpreted only qualitatively.

Figure 11(a) shows that the dissociation rate monotonically decreases with increasing
pressure. This eﬀect may have several reasons, for instance, increased collisional quenching
of the excited molecules at higher pressures or diminished microwave power transfer to the
molecules. Under constant total pressure an increase of the dissociation rate with growing
H2 content in the mixture can be noticed in Fig. 11(b).

IV. CONCLUSION

Our attempt to study the informational contents of the intensity of the hydrogen disso-
ciation continuum and to check its applicability for plasma diagnostics has been a priory
limited in two diﬀerent respects.

1) We intended to have an experimental technique as simple as possible and, in par-
ticular, to stay on the basis of emission spectroscopy only. Then the methods would be
especially useful in various industrial applications including rather easy in situ control of
plasma processing. The approach has in principle a backside because the knowledge of the
actual electron energy distribution function and its spatial distribution may be of impor-
tance for a correct extraction of the information about plasma parameters. Langmuir probe
measurements of electron energy distributions are not a problem nowadays [even in the cases
of space-charge layers [57], RF [58,59] and microwave discharges (see [60] and Refs. herein)].
We limited ourselves with intensity measurements in the more or less easy detectable
near-UV region because the following second restriction of our attempt seems to be more
signiﬁcant.

2) Our analysis of the known characteristics of radiative and collisional processes involved
into the mechanism of formation of observable continuum emission led us to the conclusion
that in spite of numerous eﬀorts the situation is still unsatisfactory. Therefore, only simple
models are available and justiﬁed. The corona-like model of the excitation (neglecting the
rotational structure of upper vibronic levels) and the Franck-Condon approximation for
electron impact excitation are actually available and justiﬁed right now.

Nevertheless, even in such complicated conditions we were happy to ﬁnd that more or
less accurate measurements of relative and absolute spectral distributions of the continuum
intensity may be used for certain estimations of the vibrational temperature, for the ana-
lysis of the excitation mechanisms and for getting information about the rate of hydrogen
dissociation by electron impact.

16

The last one looks most prospective because in some cases it may be already used as
it is. If, for example, one is interested in the relative dependence of the electron impact
dissociation rate on the position in plasma or on discharge conditions, the information may
be easily obtained just by a measurement of the continuum emission intensity even without
any calibrations. The method of the determination of the absolute rate of the electron impact
dissociation may be considerably improved, if the electron energy distribution function would
be determined experimentally or calculated somehow. Then there would be no need to use
our graph in Fig. 10 but to calculate the values in an explicit way.

This rather easy and independent method of determination of the absolute values of the
rate of electron impact dissociation of hydrogen may be used in gas discharge physics and
in plasma chemistry within two approaches.

1) It may be used for the determination of the hydrogen dissociation degree (which is
often considered as a very important plasma parameter), if one is able to determine the
eﬀective mean lifetime of atoms in plasma with certain theoretical model of diﬀusion and
association of atoms (see e.g. [61]).

2) If the value of the dissociation degree is determined by one of the existing methods
(see [62,63])) then the eﬀective lifetime of atoms in plasma may be determined with the help
of the rate of dissociation and the corresponding balance equation for atoms.

In both cases the method proposed in the present work is giving new opportunities.
Further improvements need more detailed information about the elementary processes
especially those about the cross sections of electronic-vibrational (better electronic-vibro-
rotational) a3Σ+
g , v, N electron impact excitation and the rate coeﬃcients
g , v′, N ′ levels in collisions with electrons, atoms and molecules. We
of the quenching of a3Σ+
certainly understand those are not simple problems, but we may hope that the needs of
plasma diagnostics and our present work may be considered as some kind of the challenge
for our colleagues working in the ﬁeld of electronic and atomic collision physics.

Abstract
The resonant interaction between three waves in a uniform magnetized plasma is considered. Using

the somewhat inaccessible result of the general theory we deduce the explicit expressions for the coupling

coeﬃcients of a cold magnetized two-component plasma.

INTRODUCTION

The physics of nonlinear waves is a rapidly developing research ﬁeld which has recently received
increased attention (e.g. Shukla 2004; Stenﬂo 2004; Onishchenko et al 2004 ; Vladimirov and Yu
2004; Wu and Chao 2004; Shukla and Stenﬂo 2005a,b; Azeem and Mirza 2005; Mendonca et al. 2005;
Marklund and Shukla 2005). Although there are general formalisms to treat such phenomena, there
is also a need to have access to reliable explicit expressions for speciﬁc cases. As a particular example,
Brodin and Stenﬂo (1988; 1990) considered the resonant interaction between three MHD waves in
a plasma. Starting from the standard MHD theory they thus derived the coupling coeﬃcients.
However, the textbook MHD equations are not able to correctly treat the nonlinear interaction
between three Alfv´en waves (c.f. Shukla and Stenﬂo 2005b). In the present paper we are therefore
going to reconsider the general nonlinear interaction between three waves in a cold, magnetized,
two-component plasma, in order to derive the explicit expressions for the coupling coeﬃcients. Such
expressions have previously been presented for a one-component plasma (Stenﬂo 1973), but, due to
algebraic diﬃculties, never before for a two-component plasma.

II. RESULTS

Considering the resonant interaction between three waves with frequencies ωj (j = 1, 2, 3) and

wave vectors kj, we assume that the matching conditions

are satisﬁed. The development of, for example, the z-components (Ejz) of the wave electric ﬁeld
amplitudes is then governed by the three coupled bilinear equations (e.g. Stenﬂo 1994)

are the coupling coeﬃcients, d/dt = ∂/∂t + vgj · ∇ + νj where vgj is the group velocity of wave
j, and νj accounts for the linear damping rate. The general formula for αj for a hot magnetized
plasma has been derived previously (e.g. Stenﬂo and Larsson 1977; Stenﬂo 1994) and it is therefore
here only presented in Appendix A. Although, in principle, it covers all interaction mechanisms
in uniform plasmas, it is not easy to apply it directly to, for example, Alfv´en waves in a cold

are the particle charge and mass, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. For notational convenience,
the subscript σ denoting the various particle species has been left out in the above formulas. We
stress that no approximations have to be used to derive the expressions (4)-(8) which thus are quite
general for the case of three wave interactions in a cold magnetized two-component plasma. It can
also be veriﬁed that (4) agrees with the coupling coeﬃcients for a magnetized one-component (Stenﬂo
1973; 1994) plasma.

Equations (3a,b,c), with (4), signiﬁcantly improve the (approximate) equations in the previous
work by Brodin and Stenﬂo (1988) for the case when the plasma is cold. Thus, although the main
emphasis in that work was on the coupling between Alfv´en waves and magnetosonic waves where
useful results were derived, it was also mentioned that there is no coupling between Alfv´en waves in
the MHD limit. The present paper shows however that this is not true. Thus there is a non-zero

3

interaction between, for example, one dispersive Alfv´en pump wave (Shukla and Stenﬂo 2005b) and
two inertial Alfv´en waves characterized by

ω1,2 ≃ k1,2zVA

where VA is the Alfv´en velocity and λe = c/ωpe. In the particular case when Ez is zero for one of
the waves, it is of course straightforward to use other variables, e.g. Ex instead of Ez, to derive
expressions similar to those above.

III. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper we have improved the approximate results for three wave interactions in an
MHD plasma (Brodin and Stenﬂo 1988) and found the explicit expressions for the coupling coeﬃcients
for wave interactions in a cold magnetized two-component plasma. Our coupling coeﬃcient C can
thus be used as a starting point (see for example Appendix B) of any estimate of the coupling
strength where the interaction between any kind of waves (Alfv´en waves, whistler waves, etc.) in a
cold plasma has to be considered. It can also be useful in interpretations of stimulated scattering of
electromagnetic waves in space plasmas (e.g. Stenﬂo 1999; Kuo 2001; 2003). In the latter case we
refer the reader to a short historical account of stimulated electromagnetic emissions in the ionosphere
(Stenﬂo 2004).

We note that the ion contributions dominate the ﬁrst three terms in (5), whereas the electron
contributions are most important for the fourth term in (5). As a result we have a non-zero coupling
coeﬃcient C for the particular case of interaction between three Alfv´en waves, in contrast to what one
obtains from the too simpliﬁed textbook MHD equations (Brodin and Stenﬂo 1988; where CAAA was
zero).

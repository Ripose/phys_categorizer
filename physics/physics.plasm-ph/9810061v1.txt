Abstract

The conventional theory of resonance broadening for a two-species plasma in a mag-
netic field is revised, and applied to an ionospheric turbulence case. The assumptions
made in the conventional theory of resonance broadening have, in the past, led to
⊥D∗ in the resonant part of the linear dielec-
replacing the frequency ω by ω + ik2
tric function to obtain the nonlinear dielectric function. Where D∗ is an anomalous
diffusion coefficient due solely to wave scattering of the particle orbits. We show
that in general these assumptions are not valid, and consequently the straightforward
substitution of frequencies is not legitimate. We remedy these problems and derive
expressions for the time-dependent components of the diffusion tensor. The improved
resonance broadening theory is developed in the context of an ionospheric problem,
namely that of the Farley-Buneman turbulence in the auroral E-region. A kinetic
description of the electrons is used. A general expression for the nonlinear dielectric
function is derived in the special case where no parallel electric field is present, and
the differences with the conventional dispersion relation are discussed.

Introduction

The problem of wave-particle interaction has always played a critical role when one tries
to understand the saturation mechanisms for plasma instabilities. Linear theory, which is
a single wave theory, which does not take into account the wave-particle interaction fails
to conserve energy and momentum, and consequently does not and should not predict
saturation. This is unphysical. But it is important to remember that the linear theory
ceases to be valid after a trapping time; the time neccessary to a charged particle to bo-
unce near the bottom of a potential well of a finite-amplitude wave. Consequently, the
predictions of linear theory beyond the trapping time are not valid. A first remedy to this
fundamental problem is provided by the so called Quasilinear theory, a weak turbulence
theory which takes into consideration the wave-particle interaction and requires a slow
time dependence of the background particle distribution function. The ensemble averaged

distribution function is then a solution to a Fokker-Planck equation. In the absence of
sources and sinks, quasilinear theory is then described through a diffusion equation which
predicts saturation of the instabilities when the background distribution function becomes
constant, or “plateaus”, along the diffusion paths which are the characteristics of the par-
tial differential equation. However, in the presence of sources and sinks, such as a back-
ground electric field or collisions, there is no saturation, since the sources and sinks tend to
destroy the plateau, and consequently the unstable waves keep on growing until they be-
come large enough for the other nonlinear processes to enter the picture. This is the case
of the problem we have elected to address, namely that of the modified two stream Farley-
Buneman instability, where the source of free energy is the electrojet and the sink is due
to the collisions of the electrons with the background neutrals. In other words quasilinear
theory does not provide an ultimate saturation mechanism much needed to describe steady
state turbulence and predict reasonable saturation amplitudes. Nevertheless the quasi-
linear theory has stood the test of time when it comes to predicting the onset of instabilities
to a certain degree of accuracy. A first attempt to improve on the quasilinear theory was
described by Dupree [5] and Weinstock [20] for an unmagnetized plasma and by Dupree [6]
and Dum and Dupree [7] for a magnetized plasma. Dupree [5] derived a perturbation
theory based on the knowledge of the electric field which allowed him to find the exact
particle orbits which were then used in the perturbation solutions of the Vlasov equation.
The principal result of this improved perturbation theory is a broadening of the wave-
particle resonance function, which in the conventional quasilinear theory is δ(ω − k · v).
This result has been the subject of many debates on strong turbulence theories in the
past two decades. The validity of some of the assumptions made by Dupree [5] was
questioned by a number of authors (Cook and Sanderson [3], Rolland [15]). A number of
authors (Salat [18], Ishihara and Hirose [10], Ishihara et al. [11, 12] have since taken the
task to study the problem of resonance broadening very thoroughly, and were able to show
successfully the shortcomings of the conventional resonance broadening approach. They all
addressed the resonance broadening problem in the case of unmagnetized plasmas, as well
as the case related to drift waves in a shear magnetic field because of the mathematical
tractability and its reduction to a form similar to the unmagnetized case. Kleva and
Drake [21] addressed the problem of stochastic E × B particle transport using a dynamical
system approach. More recently Kleva [14] investigated the problem of energy transport
in a magnetically confined plasma by E × B flow generated by a spectrum of electrostatic
waves stil using a dynamical system’s approach. He found like Ishihara et al. [12] that
the diffusion coefficient scales like E4/3 instead of E2 as predicted by the conventional
quasilinear theory. The problem addressed by Dupree [6] and Dum and Dupree [7], that
of the broadening of the wave-particle resonance in the presence of background magnetic
field, has not been addressed since probably because of its complexity.

In this paper we have investigated the problem of resonance broadening for a turbulent
magnetized plasma and compared our results to the classical calculation of Dum and
Dupree [7]. We have investigated the implications of the improved results on the Farley-
Buneman instability that occurs in ionospheric plasmas, and shown that one cannot obtain
⊥D∗ in the
the nonlinear dielectric function by just substituting the frequency ω by ω + ik2
resonant part of the dielectric function. In Section 2 we describe the mathematical model
used to investigate the Farley-Buneman instability, and derive the different components of
the diffusion tensor. In Section 3 we derived the generalized dispersion relation, and finally
in Section 4 we properly reinterpret the thresholds conditions for the Farley-Buneman

2 The Mathematical Model

2.1 The Quasi-Linear Approximation

2.1.1 The Ion Description

The ions are assumed to be highly collisional in the region of interest, namely the auroral
E-region, and unmagnetized. The ion convection is also assumed to be negligible, i.e., the
nonlinear ion terms are neglected.

With these assumptions a linear fluid model is adopted for the ions, and is best de-
scribed by the linearized momentum and continuity equations. Following Sudan [19] we
write

This equation will eventually be used in Poisson’s equation to determine the dispersion
relation.

2.1.2 The Electron Description

The electrons are described by the Vlasov equation with a relaxation model for collision

The electric field has been separated into two parts; E0 represents the electrojet back-

ground electric field, and δE the fluctuating field.

This leads to the following distribution function, which is in turn separated into a weakly
space and tine dependent average distibution function hfe(x, v, t)i, and a fluctuating part
δfe(x, v, t), that is

fe(x, v, t) = hfe(x, v, t)i + δfe(x, v, t).

We should point out that both the electric field and the distribution function decom-

positions are exact. One can easily write equation (2.4) in a compact form

+ iL(x, v, t)

fe(x, v, t) =

δE(x, t) · ∇vfe(x, v, t),

Note that the collision operator is a linear operator, and consequently its incorporation
into the collisionless Vlasov equation is not as complex as if we would have used a Fokker-
Plank or any more sofisticated collision operator.

Equation (2.7) can be solved using different techniques. In the quasi-linear approx-
imation one considers only the wave particle interaction and neglects any other effects,
such as wave coupling and radiation effects which are nonlinear effects of higher order in
a perturbation analysis based on the amplitude of the wave electric field.

To solve the quasi-linear problem we start by ensemble averaging the collisional Valsov

The quasi-linear approximation consists of neglecting the right hand side of equa-
tion (2.10) which describes the nonlinear mode coupling terms. When this term is ne-
glected, the equation to lowest order in the electric field becomes

It is clear that the drag term in the Fokker-Planck equation is solely due to the background
electric field of the electrojet and to the electron-neutral collisions.

In the absence of sources or collisions the conventional quasi-linear theory predicts a
saturation of the fluctuating fields when the distribution function becomes constant along
the diffusion paths. That is, the quasi-linear theory predicts a zero growth rate. This
however, is valid only when there are no sources or collisions; when such effects are present,
like in our case, the distribution function never plateaus along the diffusion paths since
the source and the collisions tend to destroy the plateau, which in turn leads to a non zero
growth rate; the oscillation amplitude continues to grow until nonlinear processes enter
the picture. In other words, there is no ultimate saturation of the fluctuations through
the quasilinear process.

This leads us to conclude that the conventional quasi-linear theory is not the ultimate
stabilization mechanism, and improvements on the theory are needed. One possible theory
that has been suggested, as a first attempt to remedy the problem from which the quasi-
linear theory suffers, is the resonance broadening theory which was first introduced by
Dupree [5], and applied by a number of authors, see for example Sudan [19], Robinson [16],
and Robinson and Honary [17], to the problem of irregularities in the E region.

In the next section we shall develop the resonance broadening in some details. We will
also discuss, to a certain extent, the validity limits of the conventional resonance broad-
ening. We remedy some of the problems, and show the shortcomings of this wave particle
interaction, as well as the need to provide for a complete theory of plasma turbulence.
The latter will be addressed in a companion paper describing a fully selfconsistent kinetic
theory for the Farley-Buneman instability.

2.2 The Resonance Broadening Approximation

In this section we shall address the problem of wave particle interaction in a magnetized
plasma through a nonlinear formalism that includes the nonlinear effects of the waves on
the particle orbits, but not vice versa. The electric field and the corresponding distribution
function are decomposed according to equations (2.5) and (2.6).

The fundamental assumption and the goal of the resonance broadening theory is to
evaluate the modification of the quasilinear resonance between the particles and waves.
This theory neglects the coherent contributions which arise from the coupling between
the waves and the background oscillations, as well as interactions between the background
oscillations.

We define the following operator L is then defined as follows

iL(x, v, t) = v · ∇ −

E0 + δE +

· ∇v + Ocoll(x, v, t),

fe(x, v, t) = 0.

The equation describing the evolution of the ensemble averaged electron distribution

function is given by

hfe(x, v, t)i =

∇v · hδE(x, t)δfe(x, v, t)i,

The equation governing the evolution of the fluctuating part of the electron distribution

function can be written as follows

+ iL(x, v, t)

δfe(x, v, t) =

δE(x, t) · ∇vhfe(x, v, t)i,

(2.13)

e
me

where as one can see the nonlinear term δEδfe. This term will take into account the effects
of the waves on the electrons in the resonance broadening approximation, but will not
address or investigate the effects of the electrons on the waves, neither does it take into
consideration the wave-wave interaction. The “Resonance Broadening” approximation
assumes that the quadratic nonlinearity leads to a nonlinear correction to the particle
orbits, which should be taken into account when the fields become large enough.

Equation (2.13) can be solved using a Green’s function analysis, i.e., we define the

Green’s function G which satisfies

+ iL(x, v, t)

G(x, v, t; x′, v′, t′) = δ(x − x′)δ(v − v′)δ(t − t′).

The electron distribution function is then obtained

fe(x, v, t) =

dx′dv′G(x, v, t; x′, v′, t0)fe(x′, v′, t0).

Z

Before we get into the details of the derivation, we should point out that throughout
the calculation we will omit the collisions. We will discuss the impact of collisions on the
dispersion relation when we apply the results to the case of Farley-Byneman turbulence
using the relaxation model for the collision operator already shown above.

We now separate the Green’s function into two parts; an unperturbed part G(0) and a

perturbed one G(1), i.e.,
G = G(0) + G(1)

satisfying the following equations

∂
∂t

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

+ iL0(x, v, t)

G(0)(x, v, t; x′, v′, t′) = δ(x − x′)δ(v − v′)δ(t − t′).

(2.17)

The solution to equation (2.17) can be written in the following formal form
G(0)(x, v, t; x′, v′, t′) = Θ(t − t′)δ(x(t) − x′(t′))δ(v(t) − v′(t′)),

(2.18)

where Θ(t − t′) is the Heavyside step function. Substracting equation (2.17) from equa-
tion (2.14) leads to the following expression for the perturbed part of the Green’s function

(2.20)

Following the work of Ishihara et al. [12] and references therein we can simplify equa-
tion (2.20) after making the following approximations in order to evaluate the second
term on the left hand side. We assume that the process under consideration is Gaussian,
which leads to

dx′

dv′ hL1(x, v, t)G(0)(x, v, t; x′′, v′′, t′′)L1(x′′, v′′, t′′)G(x′′, v′′, t′′; x′, v′, t′)i

(2.21)

The direct interaction approximation makes a further approximation and replaces G(0) in
the right hand side of equation (2.21) by G. Finally, the last approximation consists of
replacing G(x′′, v′′, t′′; t′) by G(x, v, t; t′), and L1(x′′, v′′, t′′) by L1(x, v, t′′) to obtain

(2.22)

Noting that L1(x, v, t) is given by equation (2.15) we can rewrite equation (2.22) as a
diffusion equation. However before we do this we will assume that the ensemble aver-
aged distribution function changes very slowly through secular changes of the integrals
(constants) of the unperturbed motion, i.e., we assume that

hfe(x, v, t)i = hfe(˜x, v⊥, vk, t)i,

where ˜x represent the guiding center coordinates of the electrons and v⊥, vk the per-
pendicular and parallel velocity components, respectively. This assumption allows us to
express the velocity gradient in terms of gradients in the guiding center coordinates. The
xpression for iL1 is as follows

δEk(t) · ∇v = −iΦk(t)k · ∇v

One can write a formal solution to the Green’s function equation as follows

where we have pulled out the velocity derivative of the averaged distribution assuming
that the time dependence of the average distribution function is much slower than the
time dependence of the orbits, and neglected the initial condition.

Notice that the solution presented through equation (2.25) has imbeded in it two time
scales. A fast time scale (associated with ω, i.e., fast oscillation time scale), and a slow
time scale that should be related to the growth time scale. The slow time scale is the
classical quasi-linear time scale required for saturation. The absence of a slow time scales
leads to the absence of saturation. The Fourier transform is clearly a transform over the
fast time scale.

At this point we need to use a fundamental property of the time propagator, which is

The diffusion coefficients are expressed in terms of the correlation function of the
corresponding random forces due to the background oscillations. They can also be defined
more accurately as the rate of time change of velocity variance around the mean value.
The components of the velocity diffusion tensor can be written in the form:

where the subscripts α and β represent the parallel and perpendicular components. The
mean value of the parallel velocity is zero, while the mean value of the perpendicular
velocity is given by the E0 × B drift due to the electric field of the electrojet.

In general, we need three correlations functions: hδxk(τ )δxk(τ ′)i, hδxk(τ )δx⊥(τ ′)i, and
hδx⊥(τ )δx⊥(τ ′)i. The first correlation function is given by

It is important to note that this correlation function was approximated by Dum and
Dupree [7] by

using a Markovian approximation, and assuming the diffusion coefficient to be indepen-
dent of time. However, such an approximation has its physical limitations as shown by
Salat [18] and Ishihara et al. [12].

We now proceed to evaluate the perpendicular correlation function by noting that by
definition the diffusion coefficient describing the diffusion of the electron guiding centers
is given

At this stage we would like to consider the case where τ ≈ τ ′, i.e., we shall consider
the case where |τ − τ ′|/τ ′ is a small parameter. This assumption is critical to the rest of
the calculations in this paper. It is also important to note that in general τ and τ ′ are
independent variables, which makes our assumption a critical one indeed. We then can
write

δE

the expression becomes

The second term can easily be identified with hδv⊥(τ ′)δv⊥(τ ′)i, and can therefore be
identified with a velocity space diffusion coefficient, which decribes random changes of
the gyroradius and phase angle, and can therefore be written as

(2.37)

(2.39)

hδv⊥(τ ′)δv⊥(τ ′)i = 2Dv⊥v⊥(τ ′)τ ′.

which finally leads to the contribution of perpendicular velocity diffusion

which finally leads to the following expression

and similar expressions for the cross diffusion coefficients.

It is clear from these results that the resonance broadening effects due to scattering of
electrons by the Modified Two Stream Farley-Buneman waves can not be accounted for by
just replacing ω by ω + ik2
⊥D∗ in the resonant part of the dispersion relation. It is obvious
from the expressions above that there is a complex time dependence of the diffusion
coefficients. Moreover, most of the published work (Dum and Dupree [7], Sudan [19],
Robinson [16], Robinson and Honary [17]) ignores the cross correlation and consequently
the cross diffusion.

3 The Nonlinear Dielectric Function

In order to obtain the dielectric function one has to use the results of the previous section.
The expression for the fluctuating part of the electron distribution function (2.26) can
now be written in the following form after using equation (2.42)

This dispersion relation differs considerably from that used by Robinson and Honary
[17] and Robinson [16] in many aspects, and therefore the consequences on the physics of
irregularities in the auroral as well as equatorial E regions are significantly different. We
will show in the next section how the accurate resonance broadening calculation affects the
threshold for Farley-Buneman instablity. We will also show how it affects the important
problem of aspect angles.

In order to extract the information hidden in the dispersion relation we have to evaluate

the time integral in the expression (3.2), a nontrivial calculation.

A final note on the time dependence. As mentioned earlier in the paper, the time
dependence that appears in the right hand side of the dispersion relation is a slow time
dependence necessary for energy and momentum balance. In other words, the time depen-
dence is necessary for wave saturation. This is a classical problem. Linear theory ignores
the slow time dependence and predicts a time independent growth rate which in turn sug-
gests that waves will grow indefinetly. Quasi-linear theory remedies this critical problem
by introducing a slow time dependence in the background distribution function. We have
retained both the fast and the slow time dependence and Fourier transformed over the fast

458

time scale. The slow time scale is associate with the diffusion time scale in the classical
quasi-linear theory. This same time scale reappears in the resonance broadening analysis.

4 The Farley-Buneman Case

In order to simplify the results and obtain a direct comparison with the classical Farley-
Buneman results we will assume that δEk = 0, and the we have isotropic turbulence.
This allows us to eliminate the parallel and cross diffusion effects, and use a simplified
dispersion relation

It is clear from the expression (4.1) that the resonance function is similar to that of the
unmagnetized case derived by Ishihara et al. [12] and Salat [18]. Therefore one can extract
similar properties of the time integral and consequently obtain some useful information
regarding the broadening of the wave-particle resonance. If we were to make the same
change of variables

Note that only the real part of R appears in the expressions for the diffusion tensor
components.

The final question to be addressed regarding this problem is that related to collisions
between electrons and neutrals. It has been established through linear theory, Kadomt-
sev [13], Coppi and Rosenbluth [2] and Hendel et al. [9], that collisional effects enter the
dispersion relation through the introduction of a collisional damping dcoll
depending on
the wave frequency, and which can be expressed as follows for electron neutral collisions

where Dcoll

is the collisional diffusion coefficient.

When combining the last two equations, we obtain the correct dispersion relation for
Farley-Buneman waves. To be more specific we can integrate the Vlasov equation with
the Bhatnagar collision operator, one can formally solve for the distribution function and
therefore the charge dewnsity to obtain the dispersion relation. The steps of this procedure
are described below.

We start with the collisional Vlasov equation, which we write in the following form

5 Summary

R

R

We have shown that the components of the electron diffusion coefficient are time depen-
dent and the conventional result that suggested replacing ω by ω + ik2
⊥D∗ in the resonant
part of dielectric function is not valid. This alters a number of results obtained through
the application of the classical resonance broadening calculations of Dum and Dupree [7],
such as Sudan’s results [19] and Robinson’s results [17] concerning the thresholds of the
Farley-Buneman and Gradient drift instabilities in the ionosphere. The correct results
will be presented in a subsequent paper to be submitted in the near future. We have
aslo added the parallel diffusion as well as the cross diffusion coefficients. The former is
identical to the one dimensional analog derived by Ishihara et al. [12] and Salat [18], the
latter has never been calculated explicitly.

Resonance Broadening Theory of Farley-Buneman Turbulence

Finally, we have explicitely derived the dispersion relation for the Farley-Buneman
waves using the improved resonance broadening formalism. Further details on the Farley-
Buneman thresholds and transport will be published in the near future.

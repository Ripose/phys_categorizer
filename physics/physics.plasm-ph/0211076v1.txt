Abstract

By means of the Nyquist method, we investigate the linear stabil-
ity of electrostatic waves in homogeneous equilibria of quantum plas-
mas described by the Wigner-Poisson system. We show that, unlike
the classical Vlasov-Poisson system, the Wigner-Poisson case does not
necessarily possess a Penrose functional determining its linear stabil-
ity properties. The Nyquist method is then applied to a two-stream

1 Introduction

The topic of quantum plasmas has recently attracted considerable attention
[1]-[9]. A central reason for this accrued interest derives from the importance
of quantum eﬀects in the performance of today’s micro-electronic devices,
for which classical transport models are not always adequate in view of the
increasing miniaturization level that is now entering the submicron domain.
Hence, it is desirable to achieve a good understanding of the basic prop-
erties of quantum transport models. The Wigner-Poisson system [10]-[12]
is a quantum transport model that has proven to be suitable in the treat-
ment of quantum devices like the resonant tunneling diode [1]. Moreover,
it has been referred [13] to as perhaps the only kinetic quantum transport
model amenable to detailed numerical simulation. In the present work, we
address the question of the stability of small-amplitude waves, described by
the Wigner-Poisson system.

A convenient tool to investigate the linear stability of systems having a
dispersion relation is provided by the Nyquist method [14],[15]. Let us brieﬂy
review the basis of this approach. Let D(ω, k) = 0 be the dispersion rela-
tion, where ω and k are the frequency and wave-number for small-amplitude
oscillations. In most practical cases, it is impossible to solve exactly the dis-
persion relation for ω as a function of k, some kind of approximation being
necessary. Hence, the imaginary part of the frequency, which determines the
stability properties of the system, can be obtained only in an approximate
way. However, exact results can be found by splitting D in its real and imag-
inary parts, D(ω, k) = Dr(ω, k) + iDi(ω, k). Then, for ﬁxed k and real ω, by
Di
varying ω from minus to plus inﬁnity we can draw a diagram in the Dr ×
plane. The resulting curve, known as the Nyquist diagram, determines the
number of unstable modes of the system, which equals the number of times
the origin is encircled by the diagram [14]. For example, using the Nyquist

2

method, one can show that equilibrium distributions that are monotonically
decreasing functions of the energy are stable against small perturbations.
Moreover, for symmetric equilibria with at most two maxima, the sign of the
so-called Penrose functional [14],[15] determines the linear stability of the
classical Vlasov-Poisson system.

In view of the utility of Nyquist’s method for classical plasmas, it seems
desirable to investigate whether it can be applied to the quantum case too.
This approach is justiﬁed, since the linear stability of waves in the Wigner-
Poisson system is described by a dispersion relation, and is therefore amenable
to Nyquist’s treatment. However, we cannot a priori expect to obtain a result
as general as in the classical case. Indeed, as we shall see, the question of
stability is subtler in the quantum framework, a typical example being pro-
vided by the two-stream instability [16]. For simplicity, in the present work
we shall only consider homogeneous equilibria for one-dimensional electro-
static plasmas consisting of mobile electrons. An immobile ionic background
guarantees overall charge neutrality.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we develop the funda-
mentals of the Nyquist method as applied to quantum plasmas described
by the Wigner-Poisson system. The stability properties of quantum plas-
mas are determined by the speciﬁc form of the quantum dispersion relation
[17],[18]. We show that there are a rich variety of possible behaviors in quan-
tum systems, which are not present in classical Vlasov-Poisson plasmas. In
particular, in Section III, we prove that a quantum analogue of the Penrose
functional cannot exist. To show this, we consider symmetric equilibria with
at most two maxima. Nevertheless, the Nyquist method can still be used
for Wigner-Poisson plasmas. This is explicitly shown in Section IV, where
we study a two-stream equilibrium, described by a bi-Lorentzian distribu-
tion function, which is amenable to exact calculations. We ﬁnd an exact
criterion for stability, which reduces to the classical criterion when quantum
eﬀects becomes negligible. However, large quantum eﬀects can destroy the
instability occurring in the purely classical case. In Section IV, we also in-
clude the example of the physically relevant distribution corresponding to a
bump-in-tail equilibrium. Our conclusions are given in Section V.

If f (x, v, t) is the Wigner quasi-distribution and φ the scalar potential, then
the Wigner-Poisson system [10]-[12] reads

Here, n0 is a background ionic density,
e and m are the electron charge
and mass, ¯h is the scaled Planck constant and ε0 is the vacuum dielectric
constant. We take periodic boundary conditions in space and assume that
, f and all its velocity derivatives tend to zero. We also assume
for large
that the initial Wigner function is everywhere positive. However, the time
evolution determined by Eq. (1) may force the Wigner function to assume
negative values. Hence, a strict interpretation of f as a true probability
distribution is impossible. In spite of that, the Wigner function may be used
as a useful mathematical tool to compute macroscopic quantities such as the
charge density and electric current.

The linear stability of a plasma, be it classical or quantum, is determined
by the dispersion relation, which is obtained after Fourier transforming in
space and Laplace transforming in time. Following this procedure, we obtain
[17] for a frequency ω and a wave number k

D(k, ω) = Dr(k, ω) + iDi(k, ω) = 0 ,

The topology of the Nyquist diagram is determined by the sign of Dr at
the points where Di = 0. As mentioned in the Introduction, the number of
unstable modes equals the number of times the Nyquist curve encircles the
origin. Therefore, unstable modes can only exist if Dr < 0 for at least one of
the points where Di = 0. In the classical case, the zeroes of the imaginary
part of the dispersion function are determined by the points at which the
distribution function has zero derivative. In the quantum case, according to
Eq. (6), the decisive points are the real roots v0 of

The geometrical interpretation of Eq.
(8) is simple: we have to ﬁnd the
points v0 that are equidistant to any two points at which F has the same
value (see Fig. 1). The corresponding distance is H. In a sense, Eq. (8)
is the ﬁnite diﬀerence version of the classical condition dF/dv(v = v0) = 0.
Finally, as Nyquist’s diagram is obtained taking exclusively real frequencies,
only the real roots of Eq. (8) are relevant.

The basic tasks we have to perform are ﬁrst solving Eq. (8), obtaining
all real roots v0 for a given H, and then studying the sign of Dr at each such
root, taking ω = k v0. Using Eq. (5), we have

is a ﬁnite quantity. A similar (but not identical) regularization procedure
holds in the classical case too [14].

Equations (8) and (12) are the fundamental equations for Nyquist’s method
for one-dimensional quantum plasmas, in which only electrostatic ﬁelds are
present. So far, the treatment has been completely general. Let us now con-
sider some particular equilibria in order to analyze the consequences of Eqs.
(8) and (12).

3 Equilibria with one or two maxima

If the equilibrium Wigner function F (v) has a single maximum vmax, then
the geometric meaning of v0 is suﬃcient to show that Eq. (8) has always one,
and only one, real solution v0 for any value of H (see Fig. 1). Depending
on the shape of F , this solution can diﬀer considerably from vmax (one has
v0 = vmax when F is symmetric with respect to vmax). However, as H goes
to zero, and again from geometrical arguments, we can convince ourselves
that v0 approaches vmax. Indeed by deﬁnition v0 is equidistant to the points
v′ and v′′ for which F (v′) = F (v′′). The corresponding distance from v0 to
either v′ or v′′ is H.

Furthermore, for (v

v0)2 > H 2 we have F (v0 + H) > F (v) and for
v0)2 < H 2 we have F (v0 + H) < F (v). Hence, the integrand in Eq.

is a positive quantity. Also, for
Since there is only one root for Eq. (8), we deduce that the Nyquist diagram
cannot encircle the origin, and therefore no unstable modes can exist for an
equilibrium with a single maximum. Thus, no matter how strong quantum
eﬀects are, the conclusion is the same as for the classical case.

Let us now consider equilibria with a single minimum, vmin (see Fig. 2).
This is equivalent to consider equilibrium Wigner functions with only two
maxima, as on physical grounds the equilibrium function must decay to zero
as
. Physically, such equilibria correspond to a situation where two
counterstreaming electron populations (with similar temperatures) co-exist.
In the classical case, the Nyquist diagram for this situation leads to the

which determines the stability properties of the system. The inequality
P [F ] < 0 is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for instability, for appro-
priate wave numbers. This can be easily seen from the classical limit H

of Eq. (12). Classically, the points v0 where Di = 0 are the maxima (
vmax,
and the minimum (vmin) of the equilibrium distribution. For v0 =
the integrand in Eq.
(12) is always positive, and thus cannot lead to in-
stability. For v0 = vmin, the real part of the dispersion function reduces to
p/n0k2) P [F ]. If the Penrose functional is positive, instability
Dr = 1 + (ω2
is ruled out. If it is negative, one can always choose k small enough so that
Dr < 0 and therefore some unstable modes must exist. This completes the
proof of the necessary and suﬃcient Penrose criterion.

The natural question now is whether there exists an analogue Penrose
functional for the quantum case. For simplicity, in the following we restrict
our discussion to Wigner equilibria that are symmetric about vmin, the point
at which F attains its minimum value. By a Galilean transformation, this
point can be taken as vmin = 0 without loss of generality. We ﬁrst notice that,
in the classical case, one only has to consider the three velocities for which

case, however, depending on the shape of the equilibrium Wigner function,
there can be more then three roots for Eq. (8), with ﬁxed H. For instance,
in Fig. 2, root v1 (connecting one increasing and one decreasing branch of
the distribution) can be obtained from the local maximum vmax, by varying
H continuously from zero to a certain value. The root v2 (connecting two
decreasing branches of the distribution) is of a diﬀerent nature, arising only
for suﬃciently large H. Indeed, it is not diﬃcult to realize that, in the case
of two maxima, there are always only three roots for Eq. (8) if H is small
enough, and up to ﬁve roots for larger values of H. Also notice that, for
symmetric equilibria, the point v = 0 is always a root, irrespective of the
value of H. For a given H, possessing one, three or ﬁve real roots depends
on the details of the equilibrium. It is not diﬃcult to prove that, in the case
of a two-humped distribution, a suﬃcient (but not necessary) condition for
having ﬁve roots to Eq. (8) is that F (vmin) = 0. This can be shown by
plotting the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. (8) as a function of v0, and
looking at the intersections of the two curves.
In general, we obtain that
one can have ﬁve solutions when F (vmin) is smaller than a certain threshold.
Note however that ﬁve roots only appear for suﬃciently large values of H; for
small enough H, there are always only three roots. In Section IV, we shall
examine a bi-Lorentzian distribution possessing at most three solutions. In
addition, we shall discuss another two equilibria, which possess ﬁve solutions
for suﬃciently large H.

Let us now consider the question of the existence of a quantum Penrose
functional. We need to examine the sign of Dr at the diﬀerent solutions of
Eq. (8). The root v0 = vmin = 0 always exists and can yield either a positive
or a negative value for the integral in Eq. (12), depending on the shape of the
equilibrium and the value of H. One can actually prove that the integral can
be negative only if H < v⋆, where v⋆ is the positive solution of the equation
F (0) = F (v⋆).

We now analyze the other roots of Eq. (8). Let v1 be the root obtained
from the maximum of F at the right of v = 0 by varying continuously H
from zero to some particular value (see Fig. 2). Referring to Fig. 2 and to
Eq. (12) (with v0 = v1), we conclude that the integrand in Dr is negative for

result, so that the sign of Dr(k, ω = kv2) cannot be determined a priori.
As the parameter H depends on the wave number, it is always possible
to choose k so as to access a root of the type
v2, for which the sign of
Dr is undetermined. The conclusion is that there is no quantum Penrose
functional, since the topology of the Nyquist diagram can be changed, in an
essential way, by the value of Dr at the quantum roots for Eq. (8). Each
speciﬁc equilibrium must be studied in detail. In the following Section, we
shall illustrate the previous theory using some concrete examples.

where ∆ is a measure of the dispersion of the distribution and a is a parameter
associated to the distance between the two possible maxima. If a2 < ∆2/3
this bi-Lorentzian distribution degenerates into a one-humped equilibrium,
which is consequently stable against linear perturbations, both in classical
and quantum cases. The major advantage of dealing with Eq. (17) is that it is
amenable to exact calculations, thus providing an appropriate example of the
use of the Nyquist method for quantum plasmas. Moreover, it models the
physically relevant situation of two counterstreaming electron populations
that co-exist within the same plasma.

Thus, there can be one or three relevant roots, according to condition (21).
This inequality, when satisﬁed, can also be seen to imply a2 > ∆2/3, which is
the same as the condition for the existence of two maxima. Hence, there can
be three real roots if and only if F is two-humped, which is not surprising in
view of the arguments given in the preceding Section.

An equivalent and illuminating way to rewrite Eq. (21) is

quantum eﬀects, only the root v0

We can show that Eq. (21) implies a2 > H 2, so that Dr as given by Eq. (26)
is indeed always positive.

In view of Eqs. (24) and (26), we see that Eq. (25) is a necessary and
suﬃcient condition for linear instability. That this condition is suﬃcient can
be easily proven: suppose that we have found a wave number k0 satisfying
Eq. (25); then any k < k0 will also satisfy it; by taking k small enough, we
can make the second addendum of Eq. (24) (which is negative) arbitrarily
large in absolute value and therefore obtain Dr < 0. Note, however, that
putting an equality sign in Eq. (25) and solving for k does not provide the
transition wave number between stable and unstable behavior. In order to
obtain it, one has to set Eq. (24) to zero and solve for k.

Equation (25) means that the plasma can become unstable for suﬃciently
large a (the two maxima are suﬃciently far apart), small ∆ (small disper-
sion) or small H (small quantum eﬀects). We also notice that, as H depends
on the wave number, quantum eﬀects can suppress the instability for small
wavelengths. The instability condition Eq. (25) conﬁrms the numerical re-
sults by Suh et al. [19]. Here, however, we have derived an exact analytical
criterion for quantum linear stability of a two-stream equilibrium.

On Fig. 3, we have plotted the Nyquist diagrams for the two-stream
equilibrium of Eq. (17) with a = 3, ∆ = 1, k = 0.2 and four diﬀerent values
of ¯h (units for which e = ε0 = m = n0 = 1 are used). We observe that
stabilization of the k = 0.2 mode occurs somewhere between ¯h = 25 and
¯h = 27. This is in agreement with the previous formulae: indeed, with this
set of parameters, it is found that Dr(k, ω = kv0
25.5.
Furthermore, Fig. 3 also shows a change in the topology of the Nyquist dia-
(c), the diagram intersects the horizontal axis in three
gram. For ﬁgures (a)
points [excluding the point (1,0) that corresponds to ω =
]; note that two
such points coincide, because of the symmetry of the distribution. For ﬁgure
(d), only one intersection survives. This change in topology corresponds to

Finally, we point out that large quantum eﬀects are not necessarily sta-
bilizing. For the two-stream equilibrium of Eq. (17), with a = 3 and ∆ = 1,
the wave number k = 0.287 is classically stable. However, increasing ¯h, one
ﬁnds that Dr(k, ω = kv0
0) becomes negative on an interval approximately
given by 7 < ¯h < 11.8. This can be easily veriﬁed by plotting Eq. (24) as
a function of ¯h or by direct substitution of the above values. However, this
destabilizing eﬀect occurs for rather limited ranges of ¯h and k. For example,
wave numbers k < 0.28 are classically unstable and are stabilized for large
enough ¯h (as in our previous example with k = 0.2); on the other hand, wave
numbers k > 0.29 are classically stable and remain stable for any value of
¯h. Only wave numbers very close to the value k = 0.287 display the unusual
behavior described above. For this reason, we can still conclude that the
most likely outcome of quantum eﬀects is stabilization.

We now show that we can explicitly write a distribution function for
which there can exist ﬁve real roots for Eq. (8). Consider the two-humped
equilibrium

F (v) =

2n0
√πa3 v2 exp(
where a is a parameter related to the equilibrium temperature. As F (0) = 0,
we should expect that Eq. (8) possesses ﬁve real roots for some (large enough)
H. We now give an explicit proof of this fact for the above equilibrium. The
solutions to Eq. (8) are obtained in this case from the equation

Apart from the obvious root v = 0, we can have two or four additional real
roots. By plotting the left- and right-hand side of Eq. (30) as a function of
v (see Fig. 4), we can show that there will be a total of ﬁve real roots if and

This implies that there can be ﬁve real roots provided H > a, that is, for
suﬃciently large quantum eﬀects. Otherwise, only three (semi-classical) so-
lutions are possible.

In the remaining part of this Section, we address the question of the
quantum linear stability of an equilibrium characterized by a large central
distribution of electrons with in addition a small bump in the tail. This is
a standard problem in plasma physics, with the small perturbation to the
central distribution representing a beam injected in the plasma. Here, we
consider the quantum aspects of the problem, by using Nyquist diagrams.
The so-called bump-in-tail equilibrium has a single minimum, but, as there
is no quantum Penrose functional, we are lead to compute the real part of
the dispersion function at all critical points (zeroes of the imaginary part of
the dispersion function). Nevertheless, the Nyquist technique is less expen-
sive than, for instance, direct calculation of the dispersion relation, since it
requires the value of Dr at a few points only.

To model the bump-in-tail equilibrium, we use the following distribution

(see Fig. 5)

F =

3π a

√2(v/a)]2
[1

[1 + (v/a)2]2

,

where a > 0 is a reference velocity that can be scaled to unity without loss
of generality. Henceforth, we set a = 1. The distribution of Eq. (33) is a
particular case of a one-parameter family of bump-in-tail equilibria whose
classical linear stability properties have been recently studied via Nyquist
diagrams [20]. In the quantum case, there is no Penrose functional and the
analysis is more involved.

Inserting Eq. (33) into the determining equation Eq. (8), we obtain the

following equation for v0

It is easy to prove that Eq. (36) has one real solution for H < 3 and three
real solutions for H
3. Furthermore, the largest of such solutions is always
positive, and coincides with the minimum of the equilibrium distribution
when H = 0 : we shall call this solution vm(H). The other two solutions
(which are real only when H
3) have no classical counterpart, and will be
called vq1(H) and vq2(H). A graph of all the roots of Eq. (34) as a function
of H is provided on Fig. 6. Again, the existence of ﬁve real roots for some
values of H is a consequence of the fact that F (vmin) = 0.

As further calculations are rather cumbersome, we only report here the
most relevant results (mostly obtained using the mathematical package MAPLE).
3, we have obtained numerically, using Eq. (12), that Dr(k, ω =
For H
kvq1) > 0 and Dr(k, ω = kvq2) > 0. At least for this particular example, this
can be shown to imply that the purely quantum solutions are irrelevant to
the linear stability properties of the equilibrium. Moreover, we have found
numerically that Dr[k, ω = kv−(H)] > 0. After an involved analysis to de-
termine the ordering of all the solutions for Eq. (8), the conclusion is that
the unstable modes satisfy

Dr[k, ω = kvm(H)] < 0 , Dr[k, ω = kv+(H)] > 0 .

(37)

This holds whatever the value of H. Remembering the dependence of H
on the wave-number and taking into account the explicit forms of vm(H)
and v+(H), it appears that the pair of conditions (37) are very complicated
expressions of k and ¯h. However, using appropriated units in which n0 =
ωp = m = 1, we were able to solve Eq. (37) numerically for a few values
of ¯h (measured in units of ma2/ωp). For ¯h = 0, we found that the unstable
modes satisfy 0.18 < k < 0.82, where k is measured in units of ωp/a. This

15

is the classical condition for linear instability. For ¯h = 10, the instability
range is given by 0.20 < k < 0.36. We see that the total band of instability
becomes smaller for a non-zero Planck’s constant. Further increasing ¯h,
taking ¯h = 100, we found that the unstable linear waves must satisfy 0.15 <
k < 0.17. For even larger quantum eﬀects, there is virtually a suppression
of all unstable modes. This is again in agreement with the numerical results
of Suh et al.
[19], where large quantum eﬀects were shown to stabilize all
classically unstable modes for a two-stream equilibrium.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have discussed the Nyquist method for the study of the
linear stability of spatially homogeneous quantum plasmas described by the
Wigner-Poisson system. For classical Vlasov-Poisson plasmas, this method
provides a simple way to analyze the stability properties. Furthermore, for
the special case of two-stream equilibria, one can construct a simple func-
tional (known as Penrose functional), whose sign determines whether unsta-
ble modes exist.

The main conclusion of the present work is that the stability analysis of
quantum plasmas is generally subtler than in the classical case. In particu-
lar, we have shown that no simple analogue of the Penrose functional can be
constructed in order to determine the stability properties of a two-humped
equilibrium. Hence, a detailed analysis is necessary for each particular case,
with generic and universal conclusions being more diﬃcult to obtain. How-
ever, we were able to prove that one-humped equilibria (i.e., with a distri-
bution that is a monotonically decreasing function of the energy) are always
stable: this is the same result as for classical plasmas.

The main mathematical reason for the subtler behavior of quantum plas-
mas is that the wave number now enters the real part of the dispersion
function through the parameter H = ¯hk/2m. This can change the topology
of the Nyquist diagram, not only by varying ¯h, but also by varying the wave
number at ﬁxed ¯h. Physically, this means that new unstable modes can arise
by resonant interaction between the quantum velocity H and some other
typical plasma velocity. Indeed, such purely quantum unstable modes have

Even when general or exact results cannot be obtained, the Nyquist tech-
nique can be successfully used for the study of particular equilibria, as was
shown in Section IV. The bi-Lorentzian equilibrium treated in that Section
has shown that large quantum eﬀects generally contribute to stabilize per-
turbations [19]. This is not always the case, however, and we have produced
an explicit example of a wave number that is classically stable and becomes
unstable for ﬁnite ¯h. Moreover, the Nyquist method has enabled us to derive
an exact stability criterion for such a bi-Lorentzian equilibrium. The Nyquist
technique was also applied to a classically unstable bump-in-tail equilibrium.
Again, large quantum eﬀects were shown to reduce the range of unstable
wave numbers.

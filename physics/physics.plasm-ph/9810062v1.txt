Abstract

The fundamental problem of Farley-Buneman turbulence in the auroral E-region has
been discussed and debated extensively in the past two decades. In the present paper
we intend to clarify the different steps that the auroral E-region plasma has to undergo
before reaching a steady state. The mode-coupling calculation, for Farley-Buneman
turbulence, is developed in order to place it in perspective and to estimate its magni-
tude relative to the anomalous effects which arise through the nonlinear wave-particle
interaction. This nonlinear effect, known as nonlinear “Landau damping” is due to
the coupling of waves which produces other waves which in turn lose energy to the
bulk of the particles by Landau damping. This leads to a decay of the wave energy
and consequently a heating of the plasma. An equation governing the evolution of the
field spectrum is derived and a physical interpration for each of its terms is provided.

Introduction

The selfconsistent theory of Farley-Buneman turbulence as developed by Sudan [8, 9],
and by Hamza and St-Maurice [3, 4] has addressed successfully a number of features
observed by radars in the equatorial and auroral ionosphere. Recently, Hamza and St-
Maurice [5, 6] developed a general fluid formalism, taking into account the previously
ignored nonlinear electron inertia effect term. The new turbulence theory provides a
possible explanation for the existence of large aspect angle echoes in the auroral E-region,
and justifies selfconsistently the link between electron heating along the magnetic field
lines and the anomalous effects induced by perpendicular Farley-Buneman turbulence. In
[5, 6] it is shown that the advection of parallel current by perpendicular drifts leads to
an anomalous parallel collision frequency. In other words, it is shown that perpendicular
Farley-Buneman turbulence can indeed lead to anomalous parallel effects which in turn
allow for parallel electric fields to be generated. This has an impact on energy conservation
since the zeroth order Ohmic heating which was confined to the plane perpendicular to
the magnetic field, can now have a parallel component due to plasma wave turbulence

hJekEki. This is made possible by the nonlinear electron inertia term. In order to clarify
the physics related to the energy transport properties of the E-region plasma we have to
discuss the different mechanisms of energy tranfer from the free energy source confined
to the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field to the particles moving along the field
lines. This can only be achieved by including mode-coupling effects and describing their
role as it pertains to the final picture.

In what follows, we will use the results of Hamza and St-Maurice [5, 6] to establish
the final link by identifying the mode-coupling terms and the terms associated with the
analog of a wave-particle interaction respectively. In particular, we will stress the fact that
the mode-coupling terms are energy conserving and that they do contribute a frequency
broadening ∆ωk as already shown by Hamza and St-Maurice [3] as well as Sudan [8, 9].
Finally we will discuss the roles of the mode-coupling terms and that of the anomalous
effects generated via nonlinear wave-particle analogs respectively. However, more impor-
tant than the comparison of the relative magnitudes of the mode-coupling rate and the
parallel rate of dissipation generated by the anomalous effects is the difference in nature
of the physics associated with each respectively. Although, the frequency broadening gen-
erated by mode-coupling, as shown by Hamza and St-Maurice [3], might indeed balance
the linear growth rate of a Farley-Buneman wave, it is only shuffling energy into other
waves. The parallel dissipation rate, on the other hand, allows wave energy to be chan-
nelled directly into electron kinetic energy. In steady state turbulence a physical process
must ultimately convert wave energy into thermal energy. This energy conservation, in
fact is a requirement for any selfconsistent theoretical model.

We already know that during the so-called “quasi-linear” phase, the background particle
distribution diffuses in such a way as to bring the growth rate of the unstable waves to zero
(“plateauing” of the distribution function), leaving a quasi-stationary spectrum interact
in such a way as to distort the spectrum but keep the energy in the spectrum roughly
constant. This is achieved by extracting energy from the resonant particles and dumping
it unto the waves. Quasi-linear theory leads to the development of a quasi-equilibrium
spectrum which persists indefinitely. The spectral energy can be shown to be proportional
to γ/ω, where γ and ω represent the growth rate and the eigenfrequency respectively. This
energy is small since it is proportional to γ/ω ≪ 1, and therefore can not be considered
to be an ultimate saturation mechanism for the problem at hand as shown by St-Maurice
[7]. Mode-coupling effects, neglected by the quasi-linear theory lead to a broadening of
the equlibrium spectrum. The mode-coupling effects can be divided into two categories.
The first class of terms can be qualified as “resonant” in the sense that waves couple while
satisfying the following relations (frequency and wavemomentum matching)

ωk′ + ωk′′ = ωk,
k′

+ k′′

= k.

(1)

The resonant mode coupling terms lead to a broadening of the quasi-linear spectrum and
the time scale associated with this effect is proportional to the spectral density (in our
case |δφ|2 ∝ γ), and therefore the resonant mode coupling process is on the same time
scale as the quasi-linear time scale. However, as shown by Hamza and St-Maurice [3, 4]
and Drummond and Pines [2] before them, the resonant mode coupling leaves the total
energy in the wave spectrum virtually untouched (constant).

464

A.M. Hamza

One major constraint in resonant mode coupling is expressed by equation (1). The
driving term is a quadratic nonlinearity of the form φk′ (t)Φk−k′ (t) and induces a time
dependence of exp [i(ωk′ + ωk−k′ )t], which in general can be very different from the time
dependence of φk(t), that is, exp [iωkt]. In other words, in the general case one has

6= ωk,

ωk′ + ωk′′
+ k′′
k′

= k.

The nonlinear source forces the field φk(t) to have terms with the time dependence of
the source rather than the natural time dependence of the field itself. This is very much
the case for a forced harmonic oscillator. This leads to separating the field variable into
two parts. The first part gives rise to resonant coupling because of frequency matching,
while the second part arises because of the non-resonant parts of the nonlinear source.
An essential feature of the latter part is that (ωk′ + ωk′′ ) can be fairly small so as to
allow the phase velocity of the resultant wave (ωk′ + ωk−k′ )/kk to be smaller than the
electron thermal velocity, and for that matter the ion thermal velocity. This means that
the non-resonant contribution of the mode-coupling terms can undergo Landau damping.
The non-resonant waves Landau damp and in the process give their energy to both the
electron and ions, i.e. heat the plasma along the field lines.

The main objective of the present calculation, is to show that the nonlinearities in
Farley-Buneman turbulence contribute coherent and resonant terms. These terms are
isolated and shown to have different impacts on the physics, especially on the energy
conservation constraint. We have omitted to discuss transient phenomena because we
are only interested in the global energy conservation on a long time scale. Higher order
nonlinearities have also been neglected in the perturbation analysis. The model has been
extensively described in [6]. Therefore we will refer the reader to that paper for formal
manipulations and for details related to the derivation of certain fundamental results.

2 Theoretical Model

The fundamental assumptions and the details of the theoretical model are described, as
mentioned above in [6]. We will only quote the results neccessary for the development of
an energy balance equation containing all the relevant terms including the mode-coupling
terms.

It is important to emphasize the fact that these two terms were completely omitted by
previous theories addressing the issues related to Farley-Buneman turbulence in the auroral
as well as equatorial E region.

recover the classic Farley-Buneman dispersion relation.

The first two terms on the right hand side of equation (3) contribute the coherent terms
discussed extensively in the paper [6]. The coherent terms can easily be identified through
a formal substitution of the expressions for J k
e into equation (3). Isolating these
coherent terms, while neglecting the four-wave coupling which generates cubic nonlinear-
ities, allows us to rewrite the top equation (6) in the following form. To illustrate this
iteration process let us consider the first term in equation (3). To proceed we need the
expression for the parallel current

Substituting equation (8) into equation (4) one obtains two types of terms. The first type
can be combined with the mode coupling term given by equation (5), while the second
type of term, a cubic term, is of the form φφJ k
e . A second iteration of this term leads
to a cubic term of the form |φk′ ω′ |2φkω. This term can combined with the left hand side
of equation (3) to obtain a renormalized dispersion relation. This effect introduces an
anomalous frequency solely due to nonlinear effects analog to a higher order wave-particle
interaction.

At this stage one has to close the system by prescribing the triple correlation function. We
shall assume that the distribution of potential fluctuations is Gaussian, which allows to
evaluate explicitly, via a perturbation scheme, the right hand side of equation (12), that

These results are very much similar to the two dimensional results published by Hamza and
St-Maurice [4] when looking explicitly at the two dimensional Farley-Buneman turbulence.
The coefficients in the current case are more complicated because we have taken into
account the electron inertia nonlinearities and included the parallel effects. We do not

468

A.M. Hamza

intend to explicitly write the expressions for the coefficients since, as might be expected
they are quite complicated and would not serve the purpose of this paper. However, we
have in equation (17) isolated two types of terms. The first term is a coherent analog of
a nonlinear wave-particle interaction, nonlinear Landau-damping, while the second is due
to a resonant three-wave coupling. The term on the right hand side of equation (17) is
due solely to mode coupling.

At this stage, one can study two limiting cases, namely a strong turbulence limit and

a weak tubulence one.

2.1 Strong Turbulence Limit

In this case equation (17) can be written in a more familiar form:

This equation can be written in the following form

h|φkω|2i =

h| ˜φkω|2i
|ǫkω|2 ,

where h| ˜φkω|2i is the incoherent driven potential obtained by identifying the right hand
side of equation (20) to the right hand side of equation (19). This has been the object of
a long debated issue related to describing strong turbulence as it occurs in plasmas. We
will try to illustrate, very briefly, the results of the debate on strong turbulence using the
fundamental results of Boutros-Ghali and Dupree [1] and references therein. When writing
Poisson’s equation we separate the coherent (phase coherent with the electric field) from
the incoherent contribution of the distribution function in the following way

where δf c and δ ˜f represent the coherent and incoherent parts of the particle distribution

us to write

2.2 Weak Turbulence Case

energy, which leaves us with:

in other words, in order to reach a steady state the right hand side has to vanish. This
leads us to the following interpretation. A steady state requires both resonant mode
coupling and the analog of a wave-particle exchange to take place; one in the absence of
the other does not neccessarily guarantee steady state turbulence. Consequently, a steady
state in Farley-Buneman turbulence requires that the free energy available in the plane
perpendicular to the magnetic field, extracted via a linear instability, be converted into
particle kinetic energy along the field lines via an analog of a nonlinear wave-particle
mechanism.

3 Summary and Conclusions

In this letter we have established the neccessary condition for steady state Farley-Buneman
turbulence. We have shown that in order to reach steady state the growth in the plane
perpendicular to the magnetic field has to be compensated by a growth along the field
line; A perfect analogy with a leaky bucket, if the we want the water level in the bucket to
remain unchanged then we need to balance the rate of pouring to the rate of leaking water.
In other words free energy is extracted from the drifts by the Farley-Buneman waves which
start to grow and couple. This process will go on, and no steady state will be reached
unless the energy is given back to the particles, in this case the particles moving along
the field lines. So two processes take place. First, linear growth and resonant coupling
of Farley-Buneman waves, then a nonlinear wave particle coupling along the field lines.
These two mechanisms when combined together can lead to steady state turbulence.

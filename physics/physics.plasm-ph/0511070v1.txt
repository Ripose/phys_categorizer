Focusing of laser-generated ion beams by a plasma cylinder: similarity theory and the
thick lens formula

It is shown that plasma-based optics can be used to guide and focus highly divergent laser-
generated ion beams. A hollow cylinder is considered, which initially contains a hot electron pop-
ulation. Plasma streaming toward the cylinder axis maintains a focusing electrostatic ﬁeld due to
the positive radial pressure gradient. The cylinder works as thick lens, whose parameters are ob-
tained from similarity theory for freely expanding plasma in cylindrical geometry. Because the lens
parameters are energy dependent, the lens focuses a selected energy range of ions and works as a
monochromator. Because the focusing is due to the quasineutral part of the expanding plasma, the
lens parameters depend on the hot electron temperature Te only, and not their density.

INTRODUCTION

Laser-driven ion sources [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] are consid-
ered to be the hot candidates for various important ap-
plications in nuclear physics, medicine, biology, material
sciences, plasma ﬁeld tomography [8, 9, 10]. When multi-
terawatt laser pulses are shot on solid state targets, copi-
ous amounts of multi-MeV ions - both protons and highly
charged heavier ions - are generated [11]. These laser-
generated ion beams have picosecond durations and orig-
inate from a few micrometer wide virtual source. How-
ever, the laser-generated ions are highly divergent and
usually are emitted within a cone with some 10-30 de-
grees opening angle. In addition, they have broad energy
spectra. These facts may impede numerous applications
for the laser-generated ion beams unless appropriate op-
tics and monochromatizing systems are developed.

Because of their high divergence, one needs very strong
ﬁelds to collimate the ion beams. Such ﬁelds exist only
in plasma. However, one cannot exploit the standard
technique of self-induced magnetic plasma lensing that
is widely used to focus conventionally accelerated ion
beams. The reason is that the laser-produced ion beams
are charge neutral, i.e. they contain electrons that com-
pensate the ion charge and current.

II. SIMILARITY THEORY OF EXPANDING
PLASMA

In the present work we consider ion beam focusing by
plasma which already contains a quasistatic electric ﬁeld.
The experimental conﬁguration is the following, Fig. 1,
[12]: a laser produced ion beam originates at the point
z =
D, x = y = 0 and propagates toward a hollow
metal cylinder of the radius R and length L, L > R.
The axis of the cylinder coincides with the z-axis. At the
same time, the second laser pulse is shot at the cylin-
der. This second pulse generates a population of hot
electrons, which penetrate through the metal and spread

FIG. 1: (color online). Geometry of the ion optics element
for focusing of laser-generated ion beams. One laser beam
generates an ion beam from the rear side of the irradiated
foil. Another laser beam hits a hollow cylinder, where a hot
electron population is generated. The cylinder has the radius
R, the length L and is located at the distance D from the
foil. The radial electric ﬁeld of the plasma inside the cylinder
collimates the ion beam.

very fast over the inner surface of the cylinder. They exit
into vacuum and generate a cloud of space charge at the
inner surface. The electric ﬁeld of this space charge is
large enough to ionize the material and to create plasma.
As a result at the initial moment we have a cylindri-
cal plasma layer with high electron temperature Te and
0. The plasma begins to ex-
low ion temperature Ti ≈
pand toward the cylinder axis due to the TNSA (tar-
get normal sheath acceleration) mechanism [13]. Nor-
mally, the cylinder surface is covered by a thin layer of
hydrogen-rich substances. Being the lightest ions, pro-
tons are accelerated ﬁrst and the plasma is usually an
electron-proton one regardless of the particular chemical
mixture of the cylinder itself.

Plasma dynamics is described by the couple of Vlasov’s
equations for electrons and ions and the Maxwell equa-
tions

which is developed inside the plasma to satisfy the

directed toward the cylinder axis.
It is this ﬁeld that
focuses the injected ions.

Because of the cylindrical symmetry, we neglect any

bye length is much smaller than the cylinder radius R,

the energy conservation law (13) is suﬃcient to describe
the electron dynamics.

The initial ion distribution is

where σi is the initial surface density of ions participating
in the plasma expansion. Because of the quasineutrality

The ion Vlasov equation and Eqs. (12)–(13) rewritten

in the dimensionless variables take the form:

Eqs. (15)-(18) contain no dimensional parameters what-
soever. As a consequence, the functions ˆT , ˆf and ˆE are
universal, i.e., they are not aﬀected by speciﬁc values
of d, R, L, σi and Te(0). This gives us an opportunity
to develop a meaningful similarity theory describing the
guidance of laser produced ion beams.

From the normalizations (4) we conclude that the elec-

tric ﬁeld E developed in the plasma is

E =

Te(0)
eR

ˆE(t/τ, ρ/R, d/R).

(19)

where ˆE is a universal function. It does not depend on
the plasma density, but is determined by the hot electron
temperature and the cylinder geometry only. This result
is valid as long as the Debye length is much smaller than
R. This means that the uncompensated charge density

is much smaller than the electron density.

When the laser produced ion beam enters plasma in-
side the cylinder, it is deﬂected by the electric ﬁeld (19).
We suppose that the beam has a lower density than the
plasma inside the cylinder and thus the beam own ﬁelds
can be neglected.

To describe the beam ion guiding in plasma we consider

Therefore the ions passing through the non-quasineutral
edge are stronger deviated than those interacting only
with the quasineutral plasma region. However, because
the Debye sheath is narrow, the relative number of the
strongly declined ions is small and these ions are deviated
to diﬀerent points of space. For these reasons the Debye
sheath at the edge of the expanding plasma does not
contribute to the ion focusing. It scatters the beam ion
instead.

Note that when the electrons pull the ions behind them-
selves (positive pressure gradient) there is an electron ex-
cess at the axis z, i.e., δn0 < 0. The constant C in (29)
is obtained from the continuity conditions of the action
S at the front and rear sides of the plasma cylinder.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have developed a closed similarity
theory of a hollow cylinder as a plasma element for ion
beam guiding. Signiﬁcantly, the beam ions are focused by
the quasinuetral part of expanding plasma rather than by
strong electric ﬁelds in the non-quasineutral leading edge
of the expanding plasma cloud. The thick lens formula
has been obtained with explicit scalings for all of the
parameters. We show that the plasma lens collimates
only ions with a quite deﬁnite energy and may be used
for monochromatization of the laser-produced ion beams.

The constraint of incompressibility is often used to simplify the magnetohydrody-
namic (MHD) description of linearized plasma dynamics because it does not aﬀect
the ideal MHD marginal stability point. In this paper two methods for introducing
incompressibility are compared in a cylindrical plasma model: In the ﬁrst method,
the limit γ
is taken, where γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats; in the second, an
anisotropic mass tensor ρ is used, with the component parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld
taken to vanish, ρk →
0. Use of resistive MHD reveals the nature of these two lim-
its because the Alfv´en and slow magnetosonic continua of ideal MHD are converted
to point spectra and moved into the complex plane. Both limits profoundly change
the slow-magnetosonic spectrum, but only the second limit faithfully reproduces the
resistive Alfv´en spectrum and its wavemodes. In ideal MHD, the slow magnetosonic
continuum degenerates to the Alfv´en continuum in the ﬁrst method, while it is moved
to inﬁnity by the second. The degeneracy in the ﬁrst is broken by ﬁnite resistivity.
For numerical and semi-analytical study of these models, we choose plasma equilibria
which cast light on puzzling aspects of results found in earlier literature.

1. Introduction

We devote our attention to the ideal and resistive MHD models, which despite their
dramatic simpliﬁcation of plasma behaviour, are crucial to the design and operation of
controlled fusion devices and are at the core of many astrophysical plasma models.
Simpliﬁed models such as these have utility if they can be used to make testable
predictions or if they yield insight into the internal processes of a system. We test
two variants of incompressible resistive MHD with these criteria in mind. The starting
point for the analysis of most plasma models is an understanding of the wavemodes that
arise: this provides information about the linear response and stability of the system
and provides a basis for much nonlinear analysis. We focus on the linear behaviour
of the plasma in this paper. For the resistive MHD model, which includes dissipation,
the wavemodes are non-normal: a full picture of linear plasma behaviour requires an
analysis of the transient behaviour of the system, as well as the eigenvalue analysis
which predicts asymptotic behaviours over long time scales. These are closely related
via pseudospectral methods [1]. In this paper we restrict attention to eigenvalue analysis.
For many plasmas of physical interest it is true that the resistive term is small: typically
this is quantiﬁed by a large magnetic Reynolds number. It might have been expected
that for small enough resistivity, the resistive MHD model could simply be treated
as a perturbation of the ideal MHD model. However, the change induced is actually a
singular perturbation, which introduces higher spatial derivatives. One of the interesting
eﬀects of this property is that eigenfrequencies in the ideal model are not necessarily
approached by the eigenfrequencies of any resistive modes, even for vanishingly small
resistivity.
Many papers have been published on the stable resistive MHD spectrum and several of
the early papers ([2]- [6]) focused on cylindrical models. These papers have established
certain generic features of the resistive spectrum. The resistive spectrum is discrete,
unlike the ideal MHD spectrum which has continua: on some intervals, every frequency
corresponds to a generalised wavemode. In the resistive spectrum, a large number of
fully complex eigenfrequencies can be found, and in general these lie along loci, or lines,
on the complex plane. Generally as the resistivity is decreased to zero these lines become
densely populated with eigenvalues.
Resistive MHD is a simple closure of the full kinetic equations, and as a result the plasma
dynamics parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld lines are often quite poorly represented [7]. For
Alv´enic modes, which do not strongly compress the plasma, these parallel dynamics
are generally unimportant. However, for the slow and fast magnetoacoustic waves, the
parallel dynamics and the eﬀects of compressibility are important; these waves are not
necessarily well modelled by resistive MHD.
It is possible to ﬁnd the compressible resistive MHD spectrum numerically (as in [5]) and
ignore the slow and fast magnetoacoustic waves that are present. On the other hand,
there are approaches which promise to isolate the Alfv´enic portion of the spectrum and
simplify the analysis. We present two of these incompressible approximations, in which

·v = 0 (at least approximately). One
the predicted motions of the plasma satisfy
approach is to artiﬁcially set the ratio of speciﬁc heats γ to inﬁnity (as in [4] and [6]).
In the other, an anisotropic mass tensor ρ is used, with the component parallel to the
magnetic ﬁeld taken to vanish, ρk/ρ⊥ →
0. With this density tensor, ideal eigenmodes
are incompressible, but to ensure exact incompressibility for resistive eigenmodes γ
. We can view these models as the extreme cases of a generalised
must again be set to
resistive MHD model with two parameters, γ and ρk/ρ⊥. The two extreme cases are
not equivalent, and the resulting spectra are qualitatively diﬀerent. We investigate
these two methods, and compare them with the compressible resistive MHD model. We
specialise to equilibria with zero background ﬂow. Note that γ
may be physically
appropriate for particular conductive ﬂuids and plasmas with β >> 1.
First, we examine the plane waves of the homogeneous incompressible MHD model.
Then we evaluate spectra in a simple cylindrical equilibrium for varying values of γ,
and with and without an artiﬁcial anisotropic density. This illustrates the transition
between the compressible and incompressible cases. We then discuss the spectra of more
general plasma conﬁgurations. A WKB analysis of a generic incompressible model is
then undertaken in order to understand the features of these spectra and to verify the
numerics. We begin by solving the dispersion relation. Then the singular features of this
function are explored by reducing it to a simpler form. To complete the groundwork for
semi-analytic calculations, the behaviour of the wave equation near these singular points
is examined. Finally, we use our WKB analysis to ﬁnd the spectrum of an example case.

2. Wavemodes in incompressible MHD limits

The ﬁrst step in the analysis of these incompressible limits is a determination of the
wavemodes in a simple homogeneous plasma. To this end we follow [7] and derive wave
frequencies. We begin by considering a wave with wavevector at some angle to the
magnetic ﬁeld B = B0ˆz, so k = kkˆz + k⊥ ˆx, travelling in a plasma with sound speed
0/µ0ρ0)1/2. We recover the Alfv´en spectrum:

the slow and the Alfv´en wavemodes still occur at very similar frequencies, and therefore
can be strongly mixed. We show this does occur, so that generic spectra determined

where B0 and P0 are the equilibrium ﬁeld and pressure, η is the resistivity and j and
v are the perturbed current and velocity. So for the ideal case (η = 0) we have that
∇·v is a constant on all irrational surfaces, and, by continuity, for ﬁnite toroidal or
poloidal mode number, we must have ∇·v = 0. In the resistive case, we have small η,
but possibly large d/dr so that resistive modes are not strictly incompressible. However,
if we also require γ

then the resistive modes are strictly incompressible.

3. Numerical results of varying incompressibility

In order to show the eﬀect of incompressibility on the resistive MHD spectrum, we
solved the compressible, resistive MHD equations numerically. We use a code based on
the description in [8].

to demonstrate the limit. We deﬁne the magnetic Reynolds number S = τR/τA where
τA and τR are the Alfv´en and resistive timescales. For a cylinder of radius rp we have

is the ‘toroidal’ mode number. We have β

resulting spectra are shown in ﬁgure 1. For this case m = 1, κ = 0.35, nq = 1.2 and

In these cases the ideal Alfv´en continuum degenerates to a point, at ωA = 0.057, but the
ideal slow continuum is ﬁnite in extent because of pressure and ﬁeld strength variation
across the plasma. The slow continuum extends to the origin because the pressure is
taken to be zero at the plasma boundary. Note the fork structure seen for the slow modes
near the origin of ﬁgure 1(a). This fork structure is lost as γ is increased [ﬁgures 1(b)–
(e)]. Finally, as γ

model, than in the more physical compressible model. It
has been shown in [6] that for this incompressible case wavemodes are eigenfunctions of
helicity and none of the modes correspond directly to physical compressible wavemodes.
In ﬁgure 1(e), the two loci of eigenvalues correspond to wavemodes of opposite helicity.
For the ρk/ρ⊥ →

compressible spectrum in ﬁgure 1(a), but with the notable absence of the slow-mode fork.

this Alfv´en eigenmode is fairly close in frequency to the slow modes, it is not surprising
that it is the one most strongly modiﬁed by an assumption of incompressibility.

4. Generic spectra in resistive MHD

For general plasma conﬁgurations with shear, the resistive Alfv´en spectrum is usually
found to form a fork (e.g. ﬁgure 2 or those in [2] - [5]) The rather diﬀerent shape of the
spectral loci in [ﬁgures 1(a)-(f)] is a consequence of the equilibrium having an Alfv´en
spectrum which degenerates to a point.
The fork structure in the resistive MHD spectrum has been qualitatively explained in
terms of WKB analysis by examining turning points within the plasma, see [3] and

[5]. The fork has three lines joining at a point below the ideal MHD continuum. Two
lines run between the intersection point and either end of the Alfv´en continuum. The
third line runs around approximately in a quarter circle to touch the imaginary axis.
In a simple model with toroidal current density constant across the plasma, there is
an analytical solution for the γ
resistive MHD spectrum [6]. We show that a
perturbed variant of this constant current model, in which a slight shear is given to the
magnetic ﬁeld, is still amenable to the manipulations performed in [6]. By introducing
shear we produce a model which has a ﬁnite width Alfv´en continuum, in which we might
hope to recover the generic fork structure found in compressible results. We therefore
solved this model using WKB analysis to explain the qualitatively diﬀerent spectrum.
In the remainder of this paper we set ρ⊥ = ρk = ρ.

5. WKB analysis of a small shear equilibrium in the limit γ

The model case is derived from [6], which considers a cylindrical plasma with a constant
axial ﬁeld and no shear. This model has been studied earlier in [9],[10]. The equations
used for this analysis are those of linearised, resistive, incompressible MHD, with γ

The idea is to introduce the shear as a small quantity, of the same order as the inverse
wave number. The analysis is then the same as the shear-free case, up to two orders in
the inverse wavenumber. The radial dependence is included in the dispersion relation
in the radially varying quantities: Bz(r), Bp(r) and q(r). We ﬁrst take the large

two branch points each. Note that around a Stokes point at some position x0, we do

7. Phase matching: a solution near the singularities

In order in proceed with WKB analysis, we need to determine the behaviour of
solutions near the Stokes points, the branch points of the dispersion relation. In the
neighbourhood of the branch point, we approximate the dispersion relation by:

Q(x)

1 + Ax

2 .

≃

≪

This is unlike the more usual situation in WKB analysis where Q(x)
x around the
Stokes points. The simplest treatment of the phase matching follows from considering
1 in which case the A = 0 case can be used as a zeroth order solution in a region
A
around the Stokes point. Note that for A = 0, the dispersion relation is independent of
x and there is no reﬂection of the wave. As we will see, as A
0 the reﬂectivity goes
to zero. The transmitted part of the wave will be decaying for ﬁnite A, so that we have
partial absorption of the travelling wave.
Our wave equation is

The other choice of sign leads to a second solution to the equation, which is growing for

The coeﬃcient of integration, C, must now be chosen such that we can match the
solution on the left-hand side of the origin to the evanescent WKB solution. We have
required u′(x)
1 (plus a
constant which can be safely ignored) in which case:
y(x) = e−ix+u(x) = e−ixeǫe2ix

1, so an oscillatory u(x) can be modelled as ǫe2ix with ǫ

These correspond to the WKB solutions, which are approximately of the form c1e−ix +
c2eix near the origin. We require that the WKB solution matched on the left-hand
side have c2 = 0 because the corresponding term grows exponentially for large negative
x. We therefore must have ǫ
. Using the asymptotic expansion of
erfc = 1
limit of equation
(29), allowing us to express this matching condition as:

paths will be WKB solutions if the integral
guaranteed if there are no singularities of our diﬀerential equation coeﬃcients in the
R
region. In particular, this requires that the circular path C
[0, 1] does not enclose any
−
Stokes points. The quantisation condition is supplied by requiring the correct behaviour
at boundaries. At the origin the WKB wavemode must be matched to a Bessel function,
and this gives the condition φ
|x=0 = π(1/4+m/2). At the outer boundary of the plasma,
we require vr = 0 (ﬁxed plasma boundary), which leads to φ
Localised modes proceed from the axis or outer boundary of the plasma and propagate
along ray trajectories (which will in this case be anti-Stokes lines) to a Stokes point.
They are then evanescent past this point, so it must be possible to draw a path
connecting the relevant Stokes point to the other boundary without crossing a Stokes
line. For Stokes points of the form Q(x) = a + bx
2 , which are present in this analysis,

|x=1 = π/2.

we have a complex phase matching criterion. The phase integral between the Stokes
point and the boundary is then required to be complex for matching to occur. This
means that we cannot follow anti-Stokes lines, along which the phase is real, exactly to
join the boundary and the Stokes point. The complex portion of the phase leads to a
correction to the path, which must be taken into account.

(35)

The WKB trajectories in the complex r plane were determined numerically, and several
loci found by ﬁnding appropriate paths in the plane, as in [3]. The loci can be
characterised by the branch of the dispersion relation which they lie on, and whether
the corresponding wave modes are fully global modes or have a turning point inside the
plasma.
Although there are three branches of the dispersion relation, on one branch it is never
possible in practice to form global modes: the rays inevitably escape towards complex
inﬁnity. The other two branches then produce the two forks.
The eigenvalues are displayed in ﬁgure 5, together with the numerical result from a code
based on [8]. The spectrum is qualitatively similar to a fork structure, but also shares
the features of the original simple model. Note that the double loci (running parallel to
each other in an arc) are still present in this model.

The nature of the diﬀerence between the two branches of the double locus can be seen
in equation (9), and the form of the dispersion function for large enough α. Here we
α0, and the two WKB solutions consist of
have two solutions for α(ω) such that α1 ≃ −
waves of opposite helicity. Finite pressure gradients in this equilibrium result in waves
of opposite helicity having slightly diﬀerent frequencies.

10. Eﬀects of the γ

approximation

→ ∞

→ ∞

The reason why we see a pair of loci in 1(e), rather than the single locus usually depicted
for compressible spectra (e.g. ﬁgure 1(a)) is that in this incompressible model (the limit
γ
) there are two classes of wavemodes present which can be excited at the Alfv´en
frequency. In a uniform ﬁeld these wavemodes are degenerate: they oscillate at the same
frequency. However the two frequencies are split when the plasma contains currents
perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld (i.e. in non-force-free plasmas). In the compressible
model at low β, these two degrees of freedom correspond to the slow (magnetosonic)
and Alfv´en wavemodes and the ratio between slow frequencies and Alfv´en frequencies
is of order β1/2.
Force-free models are important special cases,
in which pairs of loci of eigenvalues
coincide. The γ
approximation will still result in unphysical eigenmodes. We
note the paper of Ryu and Grimm [4], which uses this incompressibility assumption
to analyse a case with ﬁnite pressure gradients where we should see a double locus
structure. We nevertheless see a simple fork structure. We believe that the splitting
eﬀect is rather small in this case, so that what looks like one fuzzy locus is in fact a
double locus.

11. Conclusions

In plasma physics an assumption of incompressibility is often justiﬁed because the
parallel dynamics of the plasma and the ﬂuid compression across the ﬁeld are much
less important than the forces due to the magnetic ﬁeld. For example, incompressibility
does not generally aﬀect ideal MHD marginal stability (but this does not extend to
resistive MHD [13]).
Two incompressible resistive MHD models were compared with the physical
compressible model by analysis of their spectra. For the ﬁrst model, where the ratio
of speciﬁc heat is taken to inﬁnity, we expect from local analysis to ﬁnd two types of
wavemodes present at the Alfv´en frequency. In the second model where we again set
γ
, the parallel plasma inertia is set to zero, and we expect only one Alfv´enic
mode to be present in the spectrum, corresponding to the physical case. Numerical
computation of the spectra of a magnetic shear-free plasma conﬁrms that the second
model reproduces most of the eigenmodes associated with the Alfv´enic model correctly.
The ﬁrst model has twice as many modes present at the Alfv´en timescale.
It is noted that in general most of the modes resolved do not correspond to Alfv´en

modes and have no physical signiﬁcance. The shape of an incompressible spectrum for
a more general model, with shear present, was determined numerically and by WKB
analysis. The unusual nature of the local dispersion relation leads to a complex structure
of loci. The resulting spectrum included the ‘double locus’ of the zero shear model and
also demonstrated the fork structure that is seen generically for stable resistive MHD
spectra.
There are many qualitative features of the resistive Alfv´en spectrum that can be
reproduced by simply setting γ
. Unfortunately, physical wavemodes and
frequencies are not well modelled in this approximation. The stable part of the ideal
Alfv´en spectrum is irreparably mixed with spurious modes in this limit. However,
by using an anisotropic mass density tensor, an incompressibility constraint can be
introduced while preserving the Alfv´en modes.

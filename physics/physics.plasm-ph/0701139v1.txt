The dynamics of electric ﬁeld generation and radial acceleration of ions by a laser pulse of rel-
ativistic intensity propagating in an underdense plasma has been investigated via an electrostatic,
ponderomotive model. The model was validated on the basis of experimental observations [S. Kar et
al, Phys. Rev. Lett, submitted] in the regime of ponderomotive channeling where the space-charge
ﬁeld created by electron depletion balances the ponderomotive force almost exactly. It is found that
ion acceleration in this regime leads to the spatial focusing of ions at the edge of the intensity proﬁle
and to hydrodynamical breaking of the ion density, which in turns causes the heating of electrons
and an “echo” eﬀect in the electric ﬁeld. The formation of a short-duration bunch of ions with
narrow energy spectrum is also observed. Complete electron depletion leads to the transition to a
Coulomb explosion regime and limits ion acceleration for low plasma densities.

I.

INTRODUCTION

pulse evolution is neglected.

The study of the propagation of superintense laser
pulses in underdense plasmas provides several examples
of nonlinear dynamics, which may be referred to as a
whole as “relativistic optics” [1]. Advanced applica-
tions include the acceleration of electrons [2] and ions
[3, 4, 5, 6], the development of X- and γ-ray sources [7],
and the production of fusion neutrons [8]. At irradiances
beyond 1018 Wcm−2µm2, the laser pulse typically un-
dergoes self-focusing, due to the intensity dependence of
the index of refraction for relativistic electron velocities,
and self-channeling, due to the expulsion of plasma from
the propagation axis driven by the radial ponderomo-
tive force [9, 10]. For intense pulses, charge separation
eﬀects become important and the pulse can propagate
self-guided in a charged channel [11, 12].

In a recent experiment, the distribution of the elec-
tric ﬁeld generated during the self-channeling process was
measured with high spatial and temporal resolution us-
ing the proton imaging technique [13]. The experimental
observations were in fair agreement with two-dimensional
(2D) electromagnetic (EM), particle-in-cell (PIC) simu-
lations of the laser-plasma interaction. It was also found
that the proton images data were well reproduced numer-
ically by simulating the proton probe deﬂection in the
space- and time-dependent electric ﬁeld distribution ob-
tained from an one-dimensional (1D), electrostatic (ES)
PIC model. In this model, the laser pulse action is mod-
eled only via the radial ponderomotive force, while the

In the present paper, we describe the 1D ES model and
the results obtained with it in detail, to unfold the physics
of the generation of the electric ﬁeld structures that were
observed in the experiment. We further use this model
to gain an insight into the dynamics of ion acceleration.
The 1D simulations show that, in the regime mostly rele-
vant to the experiment, there is not a complete depletion
of electrons in the channel and the electric ﬁeld almost
exactly balances the ponderomotive force locally. The
resulting accelerating ﬁeld causes a spatial “focusing” of
the ions, which later in time (after that the space-charge
ﬁeld has vanished) pile up at the edge of the channel
forming a very sharp spike of the ion density. The den-
sity spike thus splits up due to hydrodynamical breaking,
and a short bunch of “fast” ions is generated. The onset
of hydrodynamical breaking also causes a strong heating
of electrons and the formation of an ambipolar sheath
ﬁeld around the breaking point. In other words, there is
a sort of “echo” eﬀect in the electric ﬁeld, which vanishes
at the end of the laser pulse to re-appears later at the
breaking location. Simple analytical descriptions of the
spatial focusing mechanism and of the ambipolar ﬁeld
structure around the density spike are given.

The above picture of “ponderomotive” ion accelera-
tion changes qualitatively when a complete depletion of
electron occurs around the channel axis. This marks the
transition to a “Coulomb explosion” regime where the
ions in an inner region around the axis are accelerated by
their space-charge ﬁeld. Since the latter is the maximum
electric ﬁeld that can be generated in the plasma, elec-
tron depletion has a saturation eﬀect on ion acceleration.
An analytical criterion for the transition between the
“ponderomotive” and the “Coulomb explosion” regimes
is given.

II. THE MODEL

Therefore, the equation of motion for the electrons is
written as

We now give a detailed description of the 1D, elec-
trostatic, ponderomotive model which has been already
used in Ref.[13] to simulate the radial electron and ion
dynamics due to self-channeling of an intense laser pulse
in an underdense plasma. We assume a complete cylin-
drical symmetry around the propagation axis, so that all
ﬁelds depends of the radius r and on the time t only. We
assume that the laser pulse is represented by the intensity
proﬁle given, in dimensionless units, by

dpe,r
dt

= Fr − eEr

where Er is the electrostatic ﬁeld due to the space-charge
displacement. The eﬀect of the laser force on ions having
mass mi = Amp ≫ me can be neglected, leaving the
electrostatic force ZeEr as the only force on the ions.
The ion equation of motion is thus written as

The electrostatic ﬁeld is computed via Poisson’s equation

Here, a represents the dimensionless ﬁeld amplitude, i.e.
a = e|A|/mec where A is the vector potential of the laser
pulse, and P(t) is the temporal envelope of the intensity.
Pulse diﬀraction, self-focusing and energy depletion are
neglected.

In
other words, what we describe is the dynamics of elec-
tron “guiding centers”, i.e. of quasi-particles moving un-
der the action of the ponderomotive force (PF). In the
present case, where we have to address “relativistic” val-
ues of the laser intensity (a0 > 1), the PF force can be
written as (see e.g. [14])

Fr = −mec2∂rγ,

1 + a2/α is the cycle-averaged relativistic
where γ =
factor of electrons and α = 1 or 2 for circular or linear
polarization, respectively. In this ponderomotive model,
diﬀerent choices of the laser polarization only aﬀect the
relation between the peak ﬁeld amplitude a0 and the laser
irradiance, and can be therefore included for simplicity in
a proper redeﬁnition of such a relation. In the following
we deﬁne

γ =

where I and λ are the peak intensity and the wavelength
of the laser pulse, respectively. Unless a0 ≪ 1 the elec-
tron dynamics is relativistic. For a0 & 1, besides using
the relativistic expression of the PF one has to account
for the inertia due to the high-frequency quiver motion.
This may be included via an eﬀective, position-dependent
mass m = meγ of the quasi-particles. We thus write for
the radial momentum

pe,r ≃ meγvr.

Equations (6), (7) and (8) are the basis of our particle
simulations in 1D cylindrical geometry.

Thanks to the low dimensionality of our model, it is
possible to use a very high resolution in the simulations.
A typical run used 40000 spatial gridpoints, with a spatial
resolution ∆r = dp/500 where dp = c/ωp is the plasma
frequency, and up to 3 × 107 particles for both electron
and ion distributions. It turned out that such a high res-
olution is needed to resolve the very sharp spatial struc-
tures that are generated during the simulation, as will be
discussed below. The plasma initial temperature is taken
to be zero and no signiﬁcant self-heating occurs.

For the temporal envelope of the laser pulse intensity
[Eq.1], we used for 0 < t < 2τ the following “sin2” ex-
pression

P(t) = sin4

while P(t) = 0 for t > τ . The parameter τ1/2 is thus
the FWHM duration of the laser pulse intensity. A gaus-
sian pulse proﬁle has also been tested, but no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the simulation results was evidenced.

In the simulation results shown below, the spatial coor-
dinate r is normalized to the laser wavelength λ, the time
to the laser period T , the density to the critical density
nc, and the electric ﬁeld to the “relativistic” threshold
ﬁeld E0. The deﬁnition of these parameters and their

III. PONDEROMOTIVE REGIME

As our model has been developed and numerically im-
plemented to support the interpretation of the experi-
mental results of Ref.[13], the main focus is on a regime

of parameters corresponding to that covered by the ex-
periment. In the latter, the plasma was created in a gas
jet of Helium (charge state Z = 2, mass number A = 4),
the typical electron density ne was in the range from 1018
to 1019 cm−3, the laser pulse wavelength was λ ≃ 1 µm,
the radius of the laser pulse at waist was r0 ≃ 5 µm
in vacuum, the pulse duration was 1 ps and the inten-
sity was in the range from 4 × 1018 to 2 × 1019 W cm−2.
Our results, which are presented in detail below, show
that the corresponding physical regime is mainly charac-
terised by the fact that there is not a complete depletion
(i.e. cavitation) of electrons around the laser pulse axis,
and during the laser pulse the space-charge force on elec-
trons balances almost exactly the PF (Fr + eEr ≃ 0),
i.e. the electrons are in a mechanical “quasi-equilibrium”
condition. As a consequence the force exerted on ions
during the laser pulse is directly proportional to the PF,
Fi = ZeEr ≃ ZFr. In this section we analyse in detail
such a regime of ponderomotive acceleration.

Fig.1 shows the spatial proﬁles of the electric ﬁeld Er
and of the ion density ni, and the distribution functions
in the (r, pr) phase space of ions (fi) and electrons (fe) at
four diﬀerent times, which are representative of the sub-
sequent stages of the dynamics. Fig.2 shows the complete
space–time evolution of Er and ni from the same simu-
lation as a contour plot. The parameters are a0 = 2.7,
ne/nc = 0.01, r0 = 7.5λ, τ1/2 = 330.

electrons back, as shown in the ﬁrst frame of in Fig.1 for
t = 381TL (i.e. 50 periods after the pulse peak). In this
stage, we ﬁnd the ES ﬁeld to balance almost exactly the
PF, i.e. eEr ≃ Fr (when plotting Fr/e as well in Fig.1 for
t = 381, its proﬁle cannot be distinguished from that of
Er.) Thus, at any time the electrons are approximately
in a state of mechanical equilibrium. From the electron
phase space at t = 381TL we also observe that no signiﬁ-
cant electron heating occurs, being fe a narrow function
along the pe,r axis.

During the ﬁrst stage, the electric force ZeEr acceler-
ates the ions, producing a depression in ni around the
axis. The peak momentum of the ions is 0.01mic at
t = 381TL and 0.015mic at t = 668TL, when the pulse
is over. Due to the force balance condition ZeEr ≃ ZFr
we can obtain the ion momentum as a function of the PF
proﬁle,

The fastest ion observed at the end of the pulse are ac-

maximum of Fr, r ≃ r0, since the time needed for ions
starting near the axis to reach the maximum energy is
much longer than the pulse duration. Hence we estimate

The non-relativistic approximation turns out not to be
very bad even if a0 ≃ 1 because at r = rf > r0 the

This is likely to be an overestimate for the breaking time,
since in our case the pulse duration is shorter than the
ion acceleration time and it may be proper to replace the
peak value of the amplitude a0 with some time–averaged
value ¯a < a0. Using a0 = 2.7 and r0 = 7.5 λ as in
the run of Fig.1, we ﬁnd tb ≃ 569 TL, which is about
1.6 times smaller than the value observed in simulations.
An eﬀective value of ¯a ≃ 1.6 is also consistent with the
ratio between the maximum ion energy observed in the
simulation and the ponderomotive potential [Eq.15]. The
predictions of the rough linear approximation of Fr are
thus in fair agreement with the simulation results. The
important point to stress is that in the ponderomotive
regime rb depends on r0 only, while tb depend only on
the laser pulse parameters and on the Z/A ratio, but
not on the plasma density. Our numerical simulations
performed for diﬀerent parameters in this regime show
that the spatial focusing and piling-up of ions is a robust
phenomenon which, once the spatial form of Fr is ﬁxed,
tends to occur always at the same point.

The piling up of ions at the point r = rb leads to
hydrodynamical breaking in the ion density proﬁle, as
the fastest ions overturn the slowest ones at r = rb. The
onset of hydrodynamical breaking is clearly evident in
the contours of fi at the “breaking” time tb ≃ 898TL

FIG. 3: (color) Detail of the proﬁles of electric ﬁeld Er (blue,
thick line) and ion density ni (red, dash-dotted line) around
the “breaking” point at t = 898TL.

For the simulation parameters of Fig.1 we obtain
pmax
/mic ≃ 0.02, in fair agreement with the simulation

results. We also notice from Fig.1 that for the fastest ions
the laser pulse is over before the ions are out of the PF
range (see the plots of fi for t = 381TL and t = 668TL),
thus Eq.(15) is an overestimate of the ion energy.

B. Hydrodynamical breaking

Immediately after the end of the pulse (t ≃ 668TL
in Fig.1) we ﬁnd Er ≃ 0. This indicates that the ions
have reached the electrons and restored the local charge
neutrality. At the same time, we still observe a very weak
heating of electrons, consistently with the keeping of the
quasi-equilibrium condition up to this stage.

However, the ions retain the velocity acquired during
the acceleration stage. For r > rmax, where rmax ≃ r0
is the position of the PF maximum, the force on the
ions, and thus the ion ﬁnal velocity, decrease with r; as
a consequence, the ions starting at a position ri(0) >
rmax are ballistically focused towards a narrow region at
the edge of the intensity proﬁle. This spatial focusing
eﬀect is actually very tight, as in Fig.1 we observe a large
number of ions to reach approximately the same position
(r = rb ≃ 15.5 λ) at the same time (t = tb ≃ 898TL).
Here the ions pile up producing a very sharp peak of ni.
The peak value of ni is ≃ 46n0 = 0.23nc at t = 898TL,
as shown in the detail of the density and ﬁeld proﬁles of
Fig.3. The density peak is well out of scale of the density
axis in the plots of Fig.1.

A simple model can be used to account for the spatial
focusing eﬀect and estimate its characteristic parameters
(i.e. the position and the instant at which the density
spike is formed). For the sake simplicity, the temporal
variation of Fr is neglected. If Fr was a linear function
of r, the ion equation of motion would be of the harmonic

(where the typical “vertical” shape of the contours of fi
can be noticed) and at later times, t = 1402TL.

As a particularly feature, the ion density breaking
leads to the generation of a short ion bunch (located near
r = 22λ at t = 1407TL), propagating in the outward
direction, containing nearly monoenergetic ions havind
pi ≃ 0.014mic. A similar feature was observed in the case
of “longitudinal” ponderomotive acceleration described
in Ref.[15], where the bunch formation is also shown to
be related to spatial focusing of ions and hydrodynami-
cal breaking of the ion density. In the case investigated
in Ref.[15] ion acceleration is also of ponderomotive na-
ture because the use of circularly polarized light prevents
the generation of “fast” electrons and thus the onset of
sheath ion acceleration.

In addition to the ion bunch, we observe both a small
fraction of the ions which is further acclerated at breaking
(up to ≃ 0.014mic), and another fraction which is accel-
erated inwards, having negative pi up to ≃ −0.005mic,
and thus moves back towards the axis. At later times
(t ≃ 2000TL) these ions are found to form a local density
maximum (i.e. a narrow plasma ﬁlament) around r = 0,
as can be noticed in the lower right corner of the ni(r, t)
plot in Fig.2. The appearance of these two latter com-
ponents can be traced to the eﬀect of the generation of
a strong ambipolar ﬁeld at the breaking point, which is
discussed in the next section.

C. Electric “echo” eﬀect and electron heating

In the electric ﬁeld plot at the breaking time we ob-
serve a strong ambipolar electric ﬁeld appearing around
the breaking point. The ﬁeld is rather intense (its am-
plitude slightly exceeding that of the positive ﬁeld due
to charge depletion at earlier times) and highly tran-
sient; the complete “movie” of Er(r, t) in Fig.2 shows
that the ﬁeld near the breaking point rises from zero to
its peak value over a time of roughly 200TL, and then
decreases less rapidly to lower values (see the proﬁle at
t = 1402TL). The ambipolar structure slowly moves in
the outward direction and is observable up to very long
times.

The electric “echo” is evidently correlated with the
rapid and strong heating of electrons at breaking, which
we observe in the fe plots at the breaking time. The
electron energy distribution near the breaking point at
t = 898TL (Fig.4) shows that the fastest electrons have
an approximately thermal distribution with a “temper-
ature” Te ≃ 2.5 × 10−2mec2 ≃ 12.8 keV (the whole
energy distribution may be roughly approximated by a
two–temperatures Maxwellian, see Fig.4). Due to the
strong density gradient, these hot electrons will produce
a “Debye sheath” ambipolar ﬁeld around the density
peak. From Fig.3 we observe that the spatial extension
(FWHM) of the sheath ﬁeld is ℓs ≃ 0.3λ is larger than
the extension of the density “cusp”, d ≃ 0.1λ. Thus, as a
rough model of the sheath ﬁeld we may assume a “thin”

5

FIG. 4: Electron energy distribution at r = 15.8λ and t =
898TL. The dotted line is a two-temperature Maxwellian with

plasma foil whose thickness is of the order of the Debye
length λD. Such model is analytically solvable in planar
geometry (see Appendix A) for the limit d ≪ λD. Using
this analytical result for a rough estimate, we write the
peak ﬁeld Es and the sheath extension ℓs as

Es = 2πenf d,

ℓs =

(22)

,

where nf is the ion density in the foil. Assuming pa-
rameters values from the 1D simulations, nf ≃ 0.23nc,
Te ≃ 2.5 × 10−2mec2, d ≃ 0.1λ, we ﬁnd in normalized
units λD ≃ 5.5 × 10−2λ, Es ≃ 0.12E0 and ℓs ≃ 0.24λ.
These values are already of the same order of magnitude
of the corresponding simulation results. However, we no-
tice that the “cold” electron population (see Fig.4) may
screen the ion ﬁeld, leading to a lower Es and a larger ℓs
than the above estimates. From the double–Maxwellian
ﬁt of the electron velocity distribution in Fig.4 we esti-
mate a density of “hot” electrons nh ≃ 0.17nf . Replacing
nf by nh in the above formulas (which now overestimates
nf /nh,
the screening eﬀect), λD increases by the factor
hence ℓs ≃ 1.4λ, while Es decreases by the factor nh/nf ,
yielding Es ≃ 0.02E0, improving the agreement of the
simple model with the simulation results. This supports
the interpretation of the ambipolar ﬁeld as a thermal
sheath ﬁeld around the density cusp due to the genera-
tion of “hot” electrons.

p

The onset of hydrodynamical or “wave” breaking in a
ﬂuid or a plasma is known to typically lead to heating
and particle acceleration, but the detailed physical mech-
anisms are not easy to unfold. As a suggestion we notice
that the overturn of fast particles over slower ones and the
self-intersection of particle trajectories at breaking tends
to generate a velocity distribution which is unstable to
electrostatic instabilities of the “two–stream type”, lead-
ing to electric ﬁeld generation and exciting electron os-
cillations. In addition, due to the very sharp density gra-

dients, oscillations of electrons around the density spike
are nonlinear and lead to electron heating, in a way sim-
ilar to the cases of “vacuum heating” or “interface phase
mixing” absorption phenomena at a sharp plasma bound-
ary [16, 17]. In any case, estimating the resulting elec-
tron temperature as a function of the initial conditions
(i.e. of the plasma density and the ion velocity) is not a
straightforward issue.

We conclude this section by noting that the heating of
the electrons at breaking corresponds to an overall en-
ergy loss of the ion distribution. An observable signature
in ﬂuid variables is the slowing down of the ion front
that can be noticed in Fig.2. However, at the same time,
a small fraction of the ions is able to get further accel-
eration from the electric ﬁeld; this accounts for the ions
which are observed to get further momentum after break-
ing in Fig.1 at t = 1402TL. The same phase space plot
shows that at the same time, the negative part of the am-
bipolar ﬁeld is able to change the sign of the momentum
of some slow ions which return towards the axis.

D. Comparison with experiment

The formation of a charge–displacement channel, fol-
lowed by the appearance of an ambipolar ﬁeld structure
at the edges of the channel in the wake of the laser pulse,
has been inferred experimentally from the proton imag-
ing measurements reported in Ref.[13]. In particular the
inversion of the ﬁeld direction in the wake is evident from
the data. The electric ﬁeld “echo”, i.e. the sudden re-
birth of Er after the end of the laser pulse, is thus an ob-
servable signature of the breaking produced by the spatial
focusing of the ions.

In the experiment, the charged channel was produced
in a longitudinally inhomogeneous plasma, in which the
density was increasing along the propagation axis. The
ﬁeld of view of the proton imaging diagnostic was such
that the density varied by roughly one order of magni-
tude across the plasma region where the ﬁeld was diag-
nosed. However, the observed pattern on the detector
ﬁlm was rather uniform, suggesting a weak variation of
the deﬂecting ﬁelds along the propagation axis. This is
indeed in agreement with the ponderomotive channeling
picture, since due to the balance of forces the electric
ﬁeld in the depletion channel is proportional to the PF
and thus depends only on the laser pulse parameters,
but not directly on the plasma density (an “absolute”
dependence on the plasma density may appear due to
propagation issues such as, e.g., the onset of self–focusing
and intensity ampliﬁcation in the channel). In addition,
the relativistic expression of the PF suggests a relatively
weak dependence (i.e. weaker than linear) of the electric
ﬁeld upon the laser intensity. These arguments strictly
apply to the ﬁeld created by the displacement of electrons
during the laser pulse, but the late ambipolar ﬁeld may
also be expected to have a similar dependence upon the
plasma density and the laser intensity, since the number

6

and energy of the ions which are accelerated and focused
towards the breaking point also depend on the laser pulse
parameters only.

We conclude that the 1D PIC model described in this
paper, coupled with particle tracing simulations, is a re-
liable tool in this regime to evaluate the electric ﬁeld
observed experimentally. This also validates the electro-
static, ponderomotive model for the study of ion acceler-
ation in the underdense plasma.

IV. COULOMB EXPLOSION REGIME

A. Depletion threshold

As stated above, under the action of the PF, the elec-
trons are pushed way form the axis creating a back-
holding electrostatic ﬁeld which balances the PF almost
exactly in the ponderomotive regime. However, the bal-
ance is possible only if the PF does not exceed the max-
imum possible value of the electrostatic force at some
radius r, which occurs if all electrons have been removed
up to such value of r, i.e. complete electron depletion oc-
curs, and ions have not moved signiﬁcantly yet. Within
our 1D cylindrical model, an approximate threshold con-
dition for complete electron depletion can be thus derived
as follows.

If all electrons are removed from a central region and
the ion density is equal to its initial value, the electric
ﬁeld in the depletion region is given by

Ed(r) = 2πene0r.

If Fr exceeds the force due to the “depletion” ﬁeld Ed(r),
this will ﬁrst occur near r = 0, where Fr is given approx-

FIG. 5: Amplitude threshold for complete density depletion
[Eq.(27)], as a function of the parameter ne0r2
0 with ne0 in
units of 1018 cm−3 and r0 in units of 1 µm. The ﬁlled and the
empty dot corresponds to the simulations of Fig.1 and Fig.6,
respectively.

rc = 2.82 × 10−13 cm. For ne = 1019 cm−3 [1018 cm−3],
r0 = 7.5 µm, we ﬁnd k ≃ 10 [1] and thus a complete
electron depletion is expected to occur for a0 & 10 [&
1.3]. Fig.5 shows the threshold amplitude as a function
of ner2

FIG. 6:
(color) Simulation results in the “intermediate”
regime between ponderomotive acceleration and Coulomb ex-
plosion. All the ﬁelds and distributions are the same of Fig.1,
except that the normalized ponderomotive force Fr/e is shown
(blue, dotted line) in the leftmost upper plot. The vertical
scales for the Er and pi,r (ion momentum) are the same of
Fig.1, while to improve readabiity in the upper rwo plots for
t = 902TL and t = 1402TL, Er has been multiplied by 10,
and the scale for pe,r has been shrinked with respect to Fig.1.

B. Simulation results

V. CONCLUSIONS

When the condition (27) is fulﬁlled, the ions in the
region of electron depletion will be accelerated by their
own space charge ﬁeld. Hence, Eq.(27) deﬁnes the tran-
sition between the regime of ponderomotive acceleration
and that of Coulomb explosion of the ions.

Fig.6 shows results of a 1D simulation where the laser
pulse parameters are the same of Fig.1, but the density
has been lowered by a factor of 10 (thus, ne/nc = 10−3).
For such parameters, from Eq.(27) we expect to enter
the Coulomb explosion regime. The plot of Er and of
the scaled PF Fr/e in Fig.6 at t = 380TL and the corre-
sponding contour plot of fe show that complete charge
depletion occurs in the region r < rd ≃ 8 λ. For r > rd,
eEr ≃ Fr still holds. The resulting maximum force on
the ions Fmax ≃ ZeEr(rd) is less than the maximum of
ZFr; thus, the maximum momentum of ions at the end
of the laser pulse (t ≃ 718TL) is lower than in the case of
Fig.1 for the same value of the laser intensity. Hence, for
a given laser pulse, ion acceleration saturates for decreas-
ing plasma densities as the condition (27) is crossed. The
plots corresponding to the later times show that the spik-
ing and breaking of the ion density, followed by ion bunch
formation and ambipolar ﬁeld generation, still occurs for
these parameters; however, both the ﬁeld amplitude and
the electron energy are lower now. In simulations where
the electron density is further lowered, electron depletion
occurs over almost all the pulse proﬁle, almost all ions are
accelerated by the Coulomb explosion, and bunch forma-
tion and ambipolar ﬁeld generation tend to disappear.

electrostatic,

An one-dimensional

ponderomotive
model has been used to investigate the dynamics of
charge–displacement channeling of a relativistically in-
tese laser pulse propagating in an underdense plasma.
The model has been validated on the basis of experi-
mental detection of the electric ﬁeld distributions. The
regime of ponderomotive acceleration, where ion acceler-
ation during the laser pulse occurs in conditions of me-
chanical quasi–equilibrium of electrons and partial den-
sity depletion, has been studied in detail. The late for-
mation of an ambipolar electric ﬁeld at the edge of the
channel (“echo” eﬀect) has been traced back to the spa-
tial focusing of ions by the ponderomotive force, leading
to hydrodynamical breaking and electron heating. For-
mation of a short-duration, quasi mono-energetic bunch
of “fast” ions has also been observed. Numerical obser-
vations have been supported by analytical modeling and
estimates. In particular, a threshold for the transition to
the regime of complete electron depletion and ion accel-
eration by Coulomb explosion has been given.

It is worth to notice that in this solution the peak ﬁeld,
E0 = E(x = 0±), does not depend on T , and that the
spatial extension of the sheath (i.e. the distance at which
the electric ﬁeld falls by a factor 1/2), given by

L =

d

,

(A12)

is inversely proportional to d: the thinner the foil, the
larger the sheath. Our approach is valid if L ≫ d, i.e.
λD ≫ d.

In the above solution, the fact that the ﬁeld extends
up to inﬁnity is related to the energy spectrum of elec-
trons extending up to inﬁnite energies. In some situation
it may be more physically meaningful to assume that the
electrons have a maximum energy Umax = uTe and “trun-
cate” the maxwellian up to such cut–oﬀ energy.

Pursuing this

latter approach, we restart

from
Eq.(A5). The maximum of the potential energy will be
equal to Umax = uTe, i.e. the maximum of φ is −u, and φ
will be constant beyond that point. Thus, Eq.(A5) now
reads

− ε2

0 = −[φ′(0+)]2 = e−u − eφ(0),

(A13)

and thus the equation for φ becomes

φ′ = −

eφ − e−u.

In this section we compute analytically the sheath ﬁeld
around a plasma foil having a thickness much less than
the Debye length, using a one–dimensional, cartesian ge-
ometry. The plasma foil is modeled as a delta–like dis-
tribution with the ion density given by

[φ′(z)]2 = eφ(z).

This latter equation can be integrated by the substitution
φ = ln(f ), i.e. f (z) = eφ(z). We obtain the potential

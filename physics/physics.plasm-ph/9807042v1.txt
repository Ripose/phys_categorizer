Thermodynamic quantities of Coulomb plasmas consisting of point-like ions immersed in a com-
pressible, polarizable electron background are calculated for ion charges Z = 1 to 26 and for a
wide domain of plasma parameters ranging from the Debye-H¨uckel limit to the crystallization point
and from the region of nondegenerate to fully degenerate nonrelativistic or relativistic electrons.
The calculations are based on the linear-response theory for the electron-ion interaction, includ-
ing the local-ﬁeld corrections in the electronic dielectric function. The thermodynamic quantities
are calculated in the framework of the N -body hypernetted-chain equations and ﬁtted by analytic
expressions. We present also accurate analytic approximations for the free energy of the ideal elec-
tron gas at arbitrary degeneracy and relativity and for the excess free energy of the one-component
plasma of ions (OCP) derived from Monte Carlo simulations. The extension to multi-ionic mixtures
is discussed within the framework of the linear mixing rule. These formulae provide a completely
analytic, accurate description of the thermodynamic quantities of fully ionized electron-ion Coulomb
plasmas, a useful tool for various applications from liquid state theory to dense stellar matter.

I. INTRODUCTION

−

Electron-ion plasmas (EIP) consisting of diﬀerent species of point-like ions (charge Zie, mass mi = Ai a.m.u.) and
electrons (
e, me) are encountered in numerous physical and astrophysical situations like, e.g., inertially conﬁned
laboratory plasmas, liquid metals, stellar and planetary interiors, supernova explosions, etc. [1]. Full ionization is
reached either at high temperatures T and low densities ρ (thermal ionization) or at high enough densities ρ (pressure
ionization). Even when these conditions are not satisﬁed, the approximation of full ionization is useful for calculations
in the mean-ion approximation, in which the mean ion charge corresponds to its partial ionization stage. On the
other hand, the free energy of fully ionized EIP provides the reference system for models aimed at describing the
thermodynamic properties of partially ionized plasmas [2]. In this paper, we present a completely analytic model
for the free energy of EIP, based on detailed numerical calculations for diﬀerent ionic species Z over a wide range of
density and temperature. We ﬁrst focus on the two-component plasma (TCP), consisting of electrons and a single
species of ions. Extension to ionic mixtures is considered in Sect. VI.

The Coulomb plasmas can be characterized by the electron coupling parameter Γe and the density parameter rs,

Γe = βe2/ae,

rs = ae/aB,

where β = (kBT )−1 is the inverse thermodynamic temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, ae = ( 4

lytic expressions for the thermodynamic quantities of free fermions for arbitrary degeneracy and relativity, θ and x.
Secondly, we propose simple and accurate analytic approximations for the nonideal internal and free energies of the
classical one-component plasma (OCP), which take into account the most recent hypernetted-chain (HNC) and Monte
Carlo (MC) calculations by DeWitt et al. [5] (DWSC) in the strong-coupling regime. Third, we consider the electron
screening eﬀects on the thermodynamic properties of the TCP. We employ a computational HNC scheme based on
the linear screening theory with local ﬁeld corrections, taking into account the ﬁnite temperature (ﬁnite θ) eﬀects.
The numerical calculations have been performed over a wide range of Z, Γi, and rs, and interpolated by a simple

Consider the Helmholtz free energy F , internal energy U , and pressure P of a TCP of Ni ions and Ne electrons in

the volume V . The total free energy Ftot can be written as the sum of three terms,

denote the ideal free energy of ions and electrons, respectively, and Fex is the excess free energy arising

In this paper, we restrict ourselves to conditions where the ions behave classically, which is the case in most
astrophysical situations. Quantum corrections for ions which can be important in the ultradense matter of white
dwarf interiors, neutron stars, and supernova cores have been considered, e.g., in Refs. [6,7]. Thus F (i)
id is given by
the Maxwell-Boltzmann expression. For F (e)
id , we use the well-known expressions of the thermodynamic functions of
the perfect gas of fermions (which may be degenerate and relativistic) through the generalized Fermi-Dirac integrals.
To calculate Fex, we follow the model developed by Chabrier [8] for fully ionized EIPs. As long as the ion-electron
interaction is weak compared to the kinetic energy of the electrons, Ze2/ae ≪
kBTF , this interaction can be treated
within the linear screening theory. Under these conditions, the exact Hamiltonian of the TCP can be separated out
exactly into a Hamiltonian for the electron-screened ionic ﬂuid and a Hamiltonian for a rigid electron background,
the so-called “jellium” Hamiltonian He [9,10]:

where Ki is the ionic kinetic (translational) term, ρk is the Fourier component of the ionic microscopic density and
ǫ(k) is the static screening function of the electron ﬂuid to be discussed below. The Hamiltonian H eﬀ characterizes
the electron-screened ion ﬂuid with the interparticle potential whose Fourier transform is

which is the sum of the bare ionic potential and the induced polarization potential.

The ion-ion (ii) and the ion-electron (ie) Coulomb interactions can thus be separated from the exchange-correlation
contribution in the electron ﬂuid (ee). The excess part of the free energy (6) can then be written as Fex = Fee+Fii+Fie;
the quantities labeled ie will be referred to as electron-screening quantities. It is convenient to consider dimensionless
quantities fee ≡

The ion-electron interactions are calculated numerically as in Ref. [8]. In this approach, the bare Coulomb potential
in the expression for the electrostatic energy is replaced by the potential statistically screened by the electrons (9),
and the HNC approximation is used to calculate the thermodynamic functions of the system. This model, originally
applied to nonrelativistic hydrogen plasmas, is now extended to the case of arbitrary Z and x. In the nonrelativistic
case (x
1), the dielectric function ǫ(k) is the ﬁnite-temperature Lindhard function modiﬁed with the local ﬁeld
correction arising from electron correlation eﬀects.

At very high density, x >
1, the electrons become relativistic. At such densities, the electron correlation eﬀects are
∼
completely negligible. The ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects (θ
= 0) may give an appreciable contribution to the screening
part of the free energy fie only at extremely high temperatures, where the nonideality of the gas has no signiﬁcance.
Thus we use the Jancovici [12] zero-temperature dielectric function in the relativistic regime.

≪

The correlation functions and thermodynamic quantities for the electron-screened ionic ﬂuid are obtained within
the framework of the HNC equations. The validity of the HNC theory for the Coulomb systems has been assessed
by several authors by comparison with lengthy MC simulations. The HNC approximation consists of neglecting the
contribution of the so-called bridge diagrams, which involves an inﬁnite series of multiple integrals, in the N -body
general diagrammatic resummations [13]. The long-range part of the direct correlation function c(r) calculated within
the HNC approximation is exactly canceled by
V (r)/kT , so that the pair correlation function g(r) is of much shorter
range than the Coulomb potential V (r) [13]. This is a required condition for Coulomb systems, because of the perfect
screening condition. This property of the HNC theory makes it particularly suitable for such long-range systems. The
diﬀerences on the free energy, the internal energy and the pressure are at most of the order of 1% (see, e.g., Refs.
[5,8]). The diﬀerence is due to the lack of bridge functions in the HNC theory.

III. IDEAL PART OF THE FREE ENERGY

The ideal free energy of nonrelativistic classical ions, neglecting their spin statistics, reads [14]:

In the limit τ

The accuracy of the nonrelativistic formulae decreases rapidly at T > 107 K. Blinnikov et al. [3] have presented a
number of approximations and asymptotic expansions of the relativistic thermodynamic functions of the ideal electron
gas. We have selected those of their ﬁtting formulae that are most accurate at low and moderate χ and supplemented
them with asymptotic expansions at high χ to obtain an approximation which is accurate at any ne for each of the

IV. OCP LIQUID OF CLASSICAL IONS

Liquid and solid phases of the OCP have been studied extensively by various numerical methods, MC simulations
or N -body semianalytic theories like the HNC theory (see Refs. [17,11] for detailed reviews). All the thermodynamic
functions of the OCP of classical ions in a uniform (rigid) electron background can be expressed as functions of the only

The most accurate MC and HNC results for the internal and free energies of the liquid OCP for 1

been obtained recently by DWSC [5] (see references therein for earlier results). The high precision of the calculations
allowed the authors to investigate the tiny eﬀects of nonadditivity of the excess energy of binary ionic mixtures, as
will be commented in Sect. VI.

This diﬀerence approximately coincides with that between the MC and HNC results for uii, therefore it should be
attributed to the lack of the bridge functions in the HNC approximation (see Sect. II). On the other hand, Eq. (28)
recovers the DH-Abe free energy with an error smaller than 0.6% at Γi < 0.1.

V. ELECTRON FLUID

The exchange and correlation eﬀects in electron ﬂuid were studied by many authors. For instance, Tanaka et al.
[24] calculated the interaction energy of the electron ﬂuid at ﬁnite temperature in the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj¨olander
[25] approximation and presented a ﬁtting formula that reproduces their results as well as various exact limits with
disgressions less than 1% (in particular, their formula incorporates the parametrization of the exchange energy by
Perrot and Dharma-wardana [26]). We adopt a modiﬁcation of this formula given by IIT [11].

The exchange-correlation free energy, fee, is obtained by integration from Eq. (11). It is important to note that
Tanaka et al. [24] give a ﬁt to the interaction energy of the electron ﬂuid but not to the thermodynamic internal
energy (the quantities diﬀer at ﬁnite θ). This enabled Tanaka et al. to obtain fee by integration of their ﬁtting formula

6

over Γe at constant θ (the integration of the internal energy would have to be performed at constant rs). Note also
that the results of IIT are nonrelativistic.

More recently, SB [22] proposed other parametrizations of the exchange and correlation free energies. At moderate
rs, comparison of the formulae given by SB and IIT reveals only small diﬀerences, which do not exceed the uncertainty
in the various numerical results found in the literature [26,27]. Unlike IIT, SB evaluated the exchange energy at θ < 1
in the relativistic case. On the other hand, the SB ﬁt reaches the classical OCP limit at large rs and moderate Γe
with disgressions up to 4.4%, while the parametrization of IIT is several times more accurate in this limit. We shall
use the IIT’s formula hereafter.

VI. ELECTRON SCREENING

A. Numerical calculations

In order to calculate the screening contribution, we have employed the model of Ref. [8], outlined in Sect. II. The
HNC equations were solved numerically for the eﬀective screened interionic potential (9) to obtain fii + fie, uii + uie,
and Pii + Pie, and for the bare Coulomb potential to obtain fii, uii, and Pii. The diﬀerence represents the screening
(ie) contribution to the thermodynamic quantities.

The previous numerical results [8] have been obtained for the hydrogen plasma (Z = 1). We extend the calculations
to diﬀerent values of Z and a larger set of rs. Figure 2 shows the eﬀective potentials V eﬀ for Z = 6 and Z = 26 at
several values of rs, compared with the bare Coulomb potential and with V eﬀ in the zero-temperature (θ = 0) RPA
approximation (no local ﬁeld correction). One can see that the latter approximation works well at the small value of
rs = 0.0256 (lower panels), while it breaks down completely at rs = 1 (upper panels).

FIG. 2. Eﬀective ion-ion potentials V eﬀ at various approximations for Z = 6 (left panels) and Z = 26 (right), for two
densities, rs = 1 (upper panels) and 0.0256 (lower ones) and three values of Γi = 1, 10, and 40. Solid lines represent
ﬁnite-temperature V eﬀ including the local ﬁeld correction, and dashes show the zero-temperature RPA approximation (the
dashed and solid lines practically coincide on the lower left panel). Bare Coulomb potential is drawn by dots for comparison.

The bulk of the calculations has been performed in the nonrelativistic approximation, for 13 ion charges from Z = 1
to Z = 26 listed in the ﬁrst column of Table II, at 10 values of the density parameter rs ranging from rs = 0.0256
2, and, at each Z and rs, for several tens of values of the coupling parameter Γi which range from the DH
to rs ≈
200. As an example, calculated values of the normalized screening part of the free energy
limit at Γi = 0.001 to Γi ∼
fie at Z = 6 are shown by ﬁlled circles in Fig. 3. Note that it is the account of the ﬁnite electron temperature in the
dielectric function that allows us to reach the correct TCP DH limit at low values of Γi (see Ref. [8]).

FIG. 3. Nonrelativistic ﬁnite-temperature (ﬁlled circles) and relativistic zero-temperature (open triangles) calculated values
of the screening part fie of the free energy of TCP for Z = 6, compared with the ﬁt (29) (solid lines). The ﬁt is also compared
with the approximation of YS [16] (dashed line), which is valid at small rs and large Γi.

In order to supplement the aforementioned nonrelativistic data at higher densities, we have also performed calcu-
1 and
lations using the Jancovici [12] zero-temperature dielectric function. The results are shown in Fig. 3 for Γi ≥
rs = 0.0625 (x = 0.224), 0.0256 (x = 0.545), and 0.008 (x = 1.75). A comparison for the case of rs = 0.0625 conﬁrms
that the zero-temperature approximation works well at small rs and large Γ (where θ
1 due to the relation (5));
this conclusion is corroborated by inspection of Fig. 2.

Thus the numerical results cover all values of rs and Γ (i.e., ρ and T ) that are relevant for liquid EIPs. At rs >

The bottom line of the table is given for reference and presents the diﬀerence between the ﬁt (28) and numerical

The calculated and ﬁtted values of fie are shown in Fig. 3 for Z = 6 and in Fig. 4 for Z = 1, 2, and 10. For
comparison, we have plotted the ﬁt of Yakovlev and Shalybkov [16] (YS) to their relativistic calculations, carried out
in the zero-temperature approximation (justiﬁed at small rs and large Γe). In Fig. 4 we have also plotted fie given by
an analytic expression of Ebeling et al. [29] reproduced by SB [22]. For the hydrogen plasma (Z = 1) it reproduces
the Pad´e approximations of Ref. [30]. One can see that the ﬁt of YS, in the range of its validity, agrees with our
results. On the contrary, the approximation of Refs. [29,22] is clearly invalid in most cases. It exhibits unphysical
0.1, predicting an enhancement of screening with decreasing rs (e. g., for Z = 1 and Γi = 0.1 it
behavior around Γi ∼
gives larger fie at rs = 0.41 than at rs = 1.464). Moreover, the extrapolation to Z > 1, proposed in Ref. [29], severely
underestimates the screening eﬀects.

0.4%, there are signiﬁcant deviations between the IIT ﬁt and our present results. This discrepancy originates from the
relatively small number of numerical calculations used by IIT (32 computed values at 0.1

of IIT [11].

The excess ionic pressure Pii + Pie is shown in Fig. 6. Calculated data are compared with the pressure obtained by
diﬀerentiation (34) of our ﬁt and of SB ﬁt. The DH approximation, shown for reference, is calculated as the diﬀerence
between the DH pressures of the electron-ion TCP and the electron OCP. The importance of the screening eﬀects is
veriﬁed by comparison of our calculated and ﬁtted pressure with the pressure of the OCP in the rigid background,
Pii, also shown in the ﬁgure.

Figure 7 demonstrates the validity of the EOS derived from our analytic formulae. The EOS of the perfect ion-
electron gas is compared with the EOS which includes the nonideality of the electron and ion ﬂuids but neglects the ie
interactions; solid lines show the complete EOS. The gaps in some isotherms indicate the regions where the formation
of bound states could not be neglected. The signiﬁcant deviations of the broken lines from the full lines in certain
ranges of ρ and T demonstrate the importance of the ion-electron screening eﬀects.

The validity of the LMR in the case of an ionic mixture immersed in a responsive ﬁnite-temperature electron
background, as described by the Hamiltonian (35), has been examined by Hansen et al. [21] in the ﬁrst-order ther-
modynamic perturbation approximation, and more recently by Chabrier and Ashcroft [32], who have solved the HNC
1)
equations with the eﬀective screened potentials for arbitrary charge ratios ranging from a symmetric case (Z2/Z1 ∼
1). These authors found that the LMR remains valid to a high degree of
to a highly asymmetric case (Z2/Z1 ≫
accuracy when the electron response is taken into account in the interionic potential, except possibly for highly asym-
metric mixtures in the region of weak degeneracy of the electron gas (where the departure from linearity can reach a
few percent).

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a completely analytic model for the free energy of fully ionized electron-ion Coulomb plasmas.
The ideal part of the free energy of electrons and ions is described by Eqs. (12)–(15) and is accurately represented by
the analytic ﬁts given by Eqs. (18)–(24). Note that these formulae provide the thermodynamic quantities of a free
electron gas for any degeneracy and relativity. For the excess free energy of the electron ﬂuid at ﬁnite temperature,
we adopt the analytic approximation from Ref. [11]. For the excess free energy of the classical ionic OCP, we provide
1 and the Debye-H¨uckel-Abe
a simple interpolation (28) which accurately reproduces the Monte Carlo results at Γi ≥
1. Finally, we have taken into account the ion-electron interactions by solving the hypernetted-chain
limit for Γi ≪
equations for a large set of the parameters Γi, rs, and Z and constructed an analytic ﬁt given by Eq. (29). Our analytic
formulae reproduce fii + fie with accuracy
2%, and the derivatives of this function with respect to rs and Γi give
an excess internal energy and pressure with relative errors not larger than a few percent. This analytic approximation
is signiﬁcantly more accurate than previous approximations of the free energy of the electron-ion plasmas.

As mentioned in the introduction, our calculations imply full ionization, i.e. point-like ions from which their bound
electrons are stripped completely. This model is realistic in various conditions at high temperatures or densities
encountered in modern laser experiments and in various astrophysical situations like, for example, stellar, brown
dwarf and giant planet interiors, or the envelopes of neutron stars. In these situations, complete ionization can be
safely assumed. Furthermore, the present model can be used as the basis of more elaborated equations of state aimed
at describing the thermodynamic properties of partially ionized plasmas and ionization equilibrium. Work in this
direction is in progress.

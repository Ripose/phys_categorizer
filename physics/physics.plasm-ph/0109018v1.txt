I. INTRODUCTION

Coulomb crystals, introduced into theory by Wigner [1], have been studied by many authors. A thorough discussion
was given, e.g., in Refs. [2,3]. Ewald technique [4,5] has been used to calculate shear constants [6] and dispersion
relations [7] of such crystals. The thermodynamics in the harmonic-lattice approximation has been analyzed, e.g.,
in Refs. [3,8,9]. Anharmonic corrections have been discussed in Refs. [10–12]. Chabrier et al. [13] have suggested
an approximate analytic model of the harmonic Coulomb crystal, which is widely used in astrophysics (e.g., Refs.
[9,14,15]). However, precise numerical calculations of the thermodynamic functions, valid at any temperature T , have
not been published.

Here we report highly accurate calculations of phonon spectra and frequency moments of body-centered-cubic
(bcc), face-centered-cubic (fcc), and hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) one-component Coulomb lattices in the harmonic
approximation. We present also accurate calculations of thermodynamic functions for bcc and fcc lattices at any values
4πniZ 2e2/M
of the quantum parameter θ = Tp/T , where Tp = ¯hωp/kB is the ion plasma temperature and ωp =
is the ion plasma frequency (ni, M , and Ze being the ion number density, mass, and charge, respectively). The
numerical results are given in the easy-to-use form of tables and ﬁtting formulas.

II. PHONON SPECTRUM AND ELECTROSTATIC ENERGY

Consider a crystal of identical ions immersed in the uniform compensating background. The basic deﬁnitions are
as follows (e.g., Ref. [5]). Let us take an arbitrary ion as the origin of a Cartesian reference frame and specify the
lattice basis l1, l2, l3 generating direct lattice vectors l(n1, n2, n3) = n1l1 + n2l2 + n3l3, where n1, n2, n3 are arbitrary
lj = 2πδij, form the reciprocal lattice. Consider
integers. The vectors g(n1, n2, n3) = n1g1 + n2g2 + n3g3, where gi ·
also the primitive cell, the parallelepiped
ν1, ν2, ν3 < 1. Let Ncell be the number of ions
with 0
in the primitive cell enumerated with an index k. The choice of the vectors li is not unique, and one can describe
a given lattice using diﬀerent Ncell. We will adopt the standard convention and choose the primitive cell with the
lowest Ncell. The bcc and fcc lattices are simple (the lowest Ncell = 1), whereas for the hcp lattice one has the lowest
Ncell = 2.

{

Along with the primitive cell one usually considers the Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell, which is a polyhedron with faces
crossing the lattice vectors at their midpoints at the right angle. The volume of the WS cell is equal to that of the
primitive cell, Ncell/ni. A convenient measure of interparticle spacing is the ion-sphere radius a = (3/4πni)1/3. The
WS cell of the reciprocal lattice is the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (BZ); its volume equals VBZ = (2π)3ni.

The frequencies ωs and polarization vectors es of lattice vibrations (s = 1, . . . , 3Ncell enumerates vibration modes)

at any point q of the BZ are determined by (e.g., Ref. [5])

where the summation is over three Cartesian coordinates (Greek indices) and over the ions in the primitive cell (k′);

The harmonic constituent of the reduced heat capacity, cV = (N kB)−1 ∂U/∂T = u + ∂u/∂ ln T , is

Using the results of Secs. II and III, we have calculated fth(θ), uth(θ), and cV (θ) for bcc and fcc crystals as
corresponding BZ averages. The mean numerical error is estimated as
1.
Let us discuss possible analytic approximations. The model of Chabrier et al. [13] assumes the linear dispersion law
for two acoustic (Debye-type) modes, ω⊥ = αωp q/qB, and an optical (Einstein-type) mode, ωk = γωp. The known
phonon spectrum moments of a Coulomb crystal are approximately reproduced with the choice α

A heuristic generalization of Eq. (12) provides a convenient ﬁtting formula to fth. Introducing three logarithmic

calculations of the thermal thermodynamic functions for hcp crystals, our analysis reveals that they do not deviate
from the functions for fcc crystals by more than a few parts in 103.

Our results can be used in any applications which require a fast and accurate evaluation of the thermodynamic

functions of the Coulomb crystals.

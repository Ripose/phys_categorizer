Abstract

It is proved that irrespective of compressibility tokamak steady states with
purely poloidal mass ﬂow can not exist in the framework of either magneto-
hydrodynamics (MHD) or Hall MHD models. Non-existence persists within
single ﬂuid plasma models with pressure anisotropy and incompressible ﬂows.

I. Introduction

[4].

Motivation of the present study was a proof that ideal magnetohydrody-
namics (MHD) steady states of magnetically conﬁned plasmas with purely
poloidal incompressible ﬂows and magnetic ﬁelds having toroidal and poloidal
components can not exist [1, 2]. The inconsistency relates to the toroidicity
because in cylindrical geometry equilibria with purely poloidal (azimuthal)
ﬂows exist without restriction on the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld [3]. The
aforementioned statement of non-existence includes tokamak equilibria; only
ﬁeld reversed conﬁgurations with purely poloidal incompressible ﬂows which
by deﬁnition have only poloidal magnetic ﬁelds are possible. Also, magnetic
dipolar steady states with purely poloidal compressible ﬂows parallel to the
magnetic ﬁeld were studied in Ref.
In tokamaks, however, poloidal
sheared ﬂows play an important role in the transition from low to high con-
ﬁnement mode (L-H transition). In fact, in many experiments no toroidal
rotation in connection with the transition is reported (see for example Ref.
[5]). It is therefore interesting to theoretically examine wether alternative or
additional physical input to incompressibility can remove the incompatibility.
The present study aims at examining whether (i) compressibility (ii) two
ﬂuid eﬀects and (iii) pressure anisotropy can give rise to the existence of
tokamak steady states with purely poloidal ﬂows. It turns out that in cases
(i) and (ii) as well as in case (iii) for incompressible ﬂows the non-existence
statement keeps hold. It should be noted that there is a number of papers
on equilibria with ﬂow within the framework of MHD [2]-[4], [6]-[17], the
two ﬂuid model [7, 14, 17], [18]-[21] and for anisotropic pressure [22]-[25].
Certain of the derivations and equations therein are related to the present
work. We will prefer, however, to present the study in a self contained way
because explicit reference to the content of the aforementioned papers for
the three models employed would make a common notation diﬃcult and the
manuscript inconveniently readable. Compressible axisymmetric MHD equi-
libria is the subject of Sec. II. In Sec. III two ﬂuid eﬀects are examined in the
framework of Hall MHD model with electron temperatures uniform on mag-
netic surfaces and either ion temperatures uniform thereon or incompressible
ion ﬂows. Pressure anisotropy for incompressible ﬂows is considered in Sec.
IV. The conclusions are summarized in Sec. V.

II. Compressibility

The ideal MHD equilibrium states of a magnetically plasma are governed
in standard notation and convenient units by the following set of equations:

∇ · (ρv) = 0,

ρ(v · ∇)v = j × B − ∇P,
∇ × E = 0,
∇ × B = j,
∇ · B = 0,

E + v × B = 0.

An energy equation or equation of state needed to close the set of Eqs. (1)-
(6) is not adopted from the beginning; it will be speciﬁed when necessary
later. On account of axisymmetry and Ampere’s law (4) the divergence-free
ﬁelds, i.e. the magnetic ﬁeld B, the current density j, and the momentum of
the ion ﬂuid element ρv can be expressed in terms of scalar functions ψ(R, z),
I(R, z), F (R, z) and Θ(R, z) as

B = I(R, z)∇φ + ∇φ × ∇ψ(R, z),

j = ∆⋆ψ∇φ − ∇φ × ∇I(R, z),
ρv = Θ(R, z)∇φ + ∇φ × ∇F (R, z).

Here, (R, z, φ) are cylindrical coordinates with z corresponding to the axis of
symmetry; the functions ψ and F label the magnetic and velocity surfaces,
respectively; ∆⋆ = R2∇ · (∇/R2). Expressing the electric ﬁeld in terms of
the electrostatic potential, E = −∇Φ, the component of Ohms law along
∇φ implies that function F is uniform on magnetic surfaces:

The electrostatic potential is also a surface quantity

as it follows by projecting (6) along B. Two other integrals are identiﬁed
in terms of surface quantities by the components of (6) along ∇ψ, and (2)
along B, respectively:

F = F (ψ).

ﬂows are of relevance. Also, it may be noted that incompressibility is a good
approximation for small ﬂows lying within the ﬁrst elliptic regime of the
equilibrium diﬀerential equations. In MHD this regime is

(17)

(see for example Ref. [9]), where the maximum value of β, deﬁned as the ratio
of the plasma pressure to the total (plasma and magnetic ﬁeld) pressure, is
about 0.35 (taking into account the particularly high values of β which have
been obtained in spherical tokamaks). Note that (17) sets nearly the same
bounds on vp as (16) as can be seen by using the deﬁnitions of Mp and β.

On the basis of (14) and (15) let us ﬁrst recover the non-existence of equi-
libria with purely poloidal incompressible ﬂows and magnetic ﬁelds having
poloidal and toroidal components. On account of incompressibility, ∇·v = 0,

(1) implies that ρ = ρ(ψ). Then, for Θ = 0, (15) can not be satisﬁed, be-
cause in addition to surface quantities it contains R explicitly, unless either
F ′ = Φ′ = 0 or X = Φ′ = 0. The former case corresponds to a static
equilibrium (v = 0). The latter implies that v is parallel to B and there-
fore Bφ = 0 as it also follows from (14). Therefore, tokamak equilibria with
purely poloidal incompressible ﬂows are not possible. Note that if, inversely,
the magnetic ﬁeld is purely poloidal (I = 0) inspection of Eqs. (14) and (15)
implies that the ﬂow is either purely poloidal or purely toroidal. Therefore
in ﬁeld reversed conﬁgurations coexistence of toroidal and poloidal incom-
pressible ﬂows is not admitted.

In the case of compressibility the density can vary on magnetic surfaces.
For purely poloidal ﬂows, however, Eqs. (14) and (15) imply I = X(ψ) and
restrict ρ to be of the form

further we need an energy equation or equation of state. Since thermal
conductivity along B is very large in high temperature plasmas, isothermal
magnetic surfaces is an appropriate equation of state for tokamaks. If T =
T (ψ), using the ideal gas law P = αρT the component of (2) along B yields
for Θ = 0

Therefore,

If H0 = αT0(1+ln ρ0) it follows from (22)that T0 = 0. Therefore, (23) implies
∇ρ0 = 0 which contradicts (20). As can be shown along the same lines
the non unique deﬁnition of ∇ρ on axis persists if alternative equations of
state are adopted such as isentropic magnetic surfaces or barotropic plasmas
[P = P (ρ)]. Thus, we can conclude that the non existence of tokamak
equilibria with purely poloidal ﬂows is extended to the compressible regime.
The above local proof of non existence can be extended near the mag-
netic axis in a direction perpendicular to the axis of symmetry for up-down
symmetric conﬁgurations.

Note that the term involving ∂2ψ/∂R∂z|0 is not included in (25) because
of the up-down symmetry assumption. Since the RHS of (25) is ﬁnite,
∂2ψ/∂R2|0 must tend to inﬁnity. Consequently, the validity of the state-
ment follows on the basis of a Mercier expansion of any solution of (24) near

Here, (z0 = 0, R0) is the position of the magnetic axis and (x, y) are Cartesian

axis becomes singular. Furthermore, it may be noted that projection of (2)

Therefore, ψ should satisfy the two diﬀerential equations (21) and (27) con-
taining the surface quantities T (ψ), H(ψ), F (ψ) and X(ψ). As will be shown
in the next section for incompressible ﬂows the solution of these equations is
irrelevant to tokamaks.

III. Two ﬂuid eﬀects

We will employ the Hall MHD, a simple two-ﬂuid model in the approxi-
mation of very small electron mass. Consequently, the electron momentum
equation can be put in the Ohm’s law form

E + v × B =

(j × B − ∇Pe) ,

(28)

h
ρ

where v is the ion ﬂuid element velocity, ρ = nM and h ≡ M/e. The right
hand side (RHS) of (28) contains the Hall and electron pressure gradient
(28) replaces (6) which is formally recovered in the limit of
terms. Eq.
h → 0. The other equations of the model are identical with (1), (2-5) on
the understanding that v = vi. The momentum equation (2) is derived by
a superposition of the electron and ion momentum equations neglecting the
electron convective velocity term because of the very small electron mass.
As in Sec.
II certain integrals will be identiﬁed in the form of conserved
quantities on magnetic surfaces by projecting (6) and (2) onto ∇φ, B and
∇ψ. The axisymmetric representations (7)-(9) of the divergence free ﬁelds
will be employed in the derivations to follow which up to Eq. (33) below hold
for velocities of arbitrary direction. Assuming that the electron temperature
is uniform on magnetic surfaces and using E = −∇Φ and Pe = αρTe(ψ) the
component of (6) along B yields

B · ∇ (Φ − hαTe log ρ) = 0

Φ − hαTe log ρ ≡ Ξ(ψ).

For h → 0 (33) reduces to the algebraic MHD equation (12). Purely poloidal
ion ﬂows will be further considered either incompressible or compressible on
an individual basis as follows.

Incompressible ion ﬂow

It is convenient to introduce the generalized vorticity

Ω ≡ B + h∇ × v.

For purely poloidal ﬂows the Ω-surfaces coincide with the magnetic surfaces.
Since Ω is divergence free it can be expressed by

Ω = N(R, z)∇φ + ∇φ × ∇ψ.

Using (34), P = Pe + Pi, E = −∇Φ and the identity

Eq. (2) can be cast in the form

electron momentum equation with the (ve ·∇)ve term being neglected. From

8

(30) and (32) then it follows Φ = Φ(ψ) and I = I(ψ). Also, substituting
the expressions for B and v from (7) and (9) into (35) leads to the following
expression for N:

where f , g, i and j are known functions of ρ, F ′, Te, Pis Φ and I. The forms of
Eqs. (42) and (43) indicate that the magnetic surfaces are identical in shape
with those of the Palumbo solution [26] which, however, can not describe
tokamak equilibria (ψ contours of this solution are provided in Figures 1 and
2 of Ref. [27]). Note that the pressure is not uniform on magnetic surfaces
and therefore the equilibrium is not isodynamic. Only under the additional
assumption P = P (ψ), (40) implies B2 = B2(ψ). Recapitulating, two ﬂuid
eﬀects in the frame of Hall-MHD model result in non pertinent to tokamaks
isodynamic like equilibria with purely poloidal incompressible ﬂows.

Compressible ion ﬂow

In connection with tokamak equilibria we will assume that additionally
to the electron temperature the ion temperature is uniform on magnetic sur-
faces. Some of the derivations in the previous part of this section, i.e. Eqs.
(30), (32), (33) and (36), remain valid. Also, for purely poloidal ﬂows irre-
spective of compressibility the velocity surfaces coincide with the magnetic
surfaces [F = F (ψ)] and therefore I = I(ψ) by (32). Using Pi = αρTi(ψ) the
component of (36) along B yields

˜W + hαTi ln ρ ≡ Λ(ψ).

Acting the gradient operator on (45) and evaluating the resulting equation
on magnetic axis leads to

Ti0 + Te0

∇ρ0 = 0

and therefore ∇ρ0 = 0. On the other side, on account of (32) and I = I(ψ),
(33) for Θ = 0 becomes

h∆⋆ψ = ρR2 [Ξ′ − hαT ′

e (1 − log ρ)] − (F ′ + hI ′) I.

(47)
A prerequisite that (47) is compatible with ∇ρ0 = 0 is that the RHS of
this relation vanishes. The RHS of (47), however, consists of the ﬁrst large
MHD-like term and the second term on the order of h which for tokamaks
is small. Therefore, these terms can not cancel each other. Note that the
ﬁrst term involving the product ρ0Ξ′
0 remains always ﬁnite because if Ξ′
0
becomes very small, this in the MHD-like limit of h → 0 would imply very
large densities by (18) which keeps valid in this limit. Therefore, it follows
from (47) that ∇ρ0 6= 0.
It may be noted that the assumption of weak
enough two-ﬂuid equilibrium eﬀects leading to non-unique deﬁnition of ∇ρ0
on axis is fulﬁlled in tokamaks particularly in the major interior part of the
plasma. The inconsistency in connection with ∇ρ0 persists if alternative ion
equations of state are adopted such as barotropic [Pi = Pi(ρ)] or isentropic
ion velocity surfaces. Therefore, as in MHD, tokamak equilibria with purely
poloidal compressible ﬂows in the framework of Hall-MHD model can not
exist.

IV. Pressure anisotropy

We will employ an one ﬂuid model with the momentum equation (2)

replaced by

ρ(v · ∇)v = j × B − ∇ · P,

(48)

10

where the tensor

is associated with the pressure anisotropy, a measure of which is the quantity

P = PkI + σBB

σ ≡

Pk − P⊥
B2

.

The other equations (1) and (3)-(6) remain unchanged. Double adiabatic
equilibria can be obtained in the framework of the Chew Goldberger Low
equations of state [30]: Pk = Sk(ψ)ρ3/B2 and P⊥ = S⊥(ψ)ρB where Sk and
S⊥ are arbitrary surface quantities. Also, adiabatic MHD equilibria with
isotropic pressure can be recovered by setting Pk = P⊥ = S(ψ)ργ, where S
is the speciﬁc entropy. Here we will consider incompressible ﬂows without
other speciﬁcation of Pk and P⊥. The integrals (10)-(12) stemming from the
Ohm’s law remain valid. The component of (48) along B yields

11

then these ﬂows are not compatible with ρ = ρ(ψ) . Static equilibria with
σ = σ(ψ) were investigated in Refs.
[28, 29]. Compatibility of (55) with
ρ = ρ(ψ) restricts σ to be of the form

σ = 1 −

f (ψ)
R2 ,

(57)

(56) then implies I =
where f (ψ) is an arbitrary surface quantity. Eq.
R2X(ψ)/f (ψ). Apparently, possible equilibria of this kind are irrelevant
to tokamaks in which the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, Bφ = I/R, must have a
vacuum component proportional to R−1.

V. Conclusions

We have shown that the non-existence of ideal MHD tokamak equilib-
ria with purely poloidal incompressible ﬂow can be extended to the cases
of (i) compressible MHD ﬂows (ii) Hall-MHD incompressible and compress-
ible ﬂows and (iii) one ﬂuid equilibria with pressure anisotropy and incom-
pressible ﬂows. The non-existence relates to the toroidicity. Speciﬁcally, for
incompressible ﬂows an inconsistency appears in terms of relations which
in addition to surface quantities have an explicit dependence on R or only
isodynamic-like equilibria are possible and for compressible ﬂows the density
gradient does not have unique deﬁnition on the magnetic axis. Also, for
MHD compressible ﬂows and up-down symmetric conﬁgurations the proof
can be extended near the magnetic axis in a direction perpendicular to the
axis of symmetry.

The existence of this kind of equilibria on account of additional physi-
cal input, e.g.
in plasmas with pressure anisotropy and compressible ﬂows,
or other models remains an open question. Experimental clariﬁcation on
whether an even small toroidal velocity is necessary for the L-H transition to
occur would be helpful. If not necessary, the existence of tokamak equilibria
with purely poloidal ﬂows from the theoretical point of view should remain
an even more challenging problem.

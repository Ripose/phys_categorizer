A simple model is derived to prove the multi-ﬁlament structure of relativistic

self-focusing with ultra-intense lasers. Exact analytical solutions describing the

transverse structure of waveguide channels with electron cavitation, for which

both the relativistic and ponderomotive nonlinearities are taken into account,

are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent development in laser technology has opened up the possibility of exploring previously

unattainable regimes of laser-plasma interactions, [1]. Intensities of the order of 1018W/cm2

and higher can now be achieved, implying that goals like compact sources for x-ray lasers,

[2], the fast ignitor concept for inertial conﬁnement fusion, (ICF) [3] and laser-plasma based

accelerators, [4], might soon be within reach. However, a major eﬀort is still required both

numerically and analytically in order to understand the nonlinear phenomena which arise in

the presence of such extremely high intensities of the electromagnetic radiation. Besides, a

good analytical insight is needed in order make numerical simulations possible and to interpret

their results, [5].

One of the problems which have received particular attention is the combined eﬀect of

relativistic and striction (ponderomotive) nonlinearities, which occur in the propagation of

superintense laser pulses through underdense plasmas (i.e., plasmas with ωp < ω, where ωp =

(4πnee2/me)1/2 is the plasma frequency and ω is the laser carrier frequency), [6]. This problem

is not fully understood yet and there is need of a self-consistent analytical description which

does not violate the global charge conservation and plasma quasineutrality when describing

self-focusing and self-channeling, [7].

1

A common feature in the above mentioned advanced schemes is that transport of laser ra-

diation over considerable distances, well beyond the diﬀraction limit, and without signiﬁcant

energy losses is required. In achieving this goal, nonlinear self-focusing and self-channeling play

an important role. Under the action of an intense laser pulse, electrons tend to be redistributed

in the transverse direction as an eﬀect of the ponderomotive pressure, the self-channeling phe-

nomenon. The subsequent self-modiﬁcation of the radial proﬁle of the refractive index is at the

origin of the nonlinear self-focusing and ﬁlamentation of the laser pulse. Nonlinear self-focusing

and self-channeling oﬀer a possibility for optical guiding of laser pulses in underdense pulses

as, for instance, the underdense corona of an ICF target, through the formation of ”hollow

channels”, [8], as experimentally observed by several groups, [9,10].

As was shown in [11], relativistic self-focusing shows qualitatively new features for ultra-

intense lasers. The ponderomotive force of super-strong ﬁelds expels electrons thus producing

”vacuum channels” which guide the radiation and stable channeling with power higher than

the critical one can take place, [12]. However, as noticed in [13], analytical descriptions led to

the appearance of negative electron densities. This problem was solved by setting the channel

boundary positions exactly at the point where the electron density became zero. Feit et al.,

[7], showed that this procedure did not conserve the global charge and proposed to include the

electron temperature eﬀect, which however was not self-consistently evaluated (the tempera-

ture was assumed to be derived from experimental conditions). Recently, we noticed that for

an overdense plasma a self-consistent description of self-induced transparency is possible which

automatically takes into account global charge conservation through Poisson’s equation, [14].

The strong analogies between 1D overdense and 2D underdense plasmas, allow for an exact

analysis of the stationary stage of electron cavitation due to the joint eﬀects of relativistic

and striction nonlinearities in underdense plasmas. This analysis leads to an exact analytical

description of the transverse structures generated by relativistic self-focusing and also demon-

strates its multi-ﬁlament nature.

Depending on the incident power and intensity distribution, several qualitatively diﬀerent solu-

tions may occur. Our aim is to give an exact analytical description of the stationary stage of the

2

fundamental conﬁgurations. We will show that, if the incident power is relatively low and the

intensity has its maximum on-axis, the plasma will react by generating a stationary stage with

a single channel acting as an optical guide for the propagating radiation. If the incident power

is increased and the intensity instead has its minimum on-axis (a higher order laser mode), then

the ﬁnal stationary stage will display two symmetric channels. Finally, for even higher incident

powers and maximum on-axis incident intensities, three channels will be generated and so on,

with the critical power for channel formation depending on the unperturbed plasma density

and the wave number of the propagating radiation.

Of particular interest will be the fact that these structures can be interpreted as the ﬁnal sta-

tionary stage of the ﬁlamentation instability, as shown by the numerical simulations presented

in [5].

In this paper, we introduce, in Section II, the model equations and the approximations we will

use to describe electron cavitation in a two-dimensional underdense plasma. The commonly

presented analysis is discussed in Section III and our results for single and multi-channel struc-

tures in 2D, planar geometry are presented in the following Sections, following a brief discussion

of the physical mechanisms behind the generation of such structures. Finally, some conclusions

are summarized in Section VI.

II. THE MODEL

Let us consider the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in a homogeneous plasma. A

complete description is based on Maxwell’s equations for the propagating laser radiation plus a

model describing the plasma response. For the problem of interest, an important simpliﬁcation

comes from the physical context. Considering short pulses with length τ such that ω−1

≪
ω−1
pi , the ion dynamics can be neglected, [12]. Furthermore, we will not be concerned with wake

pe ≪

τ

ﬁeld generation, [13], since the pulse is long enough to allow us to disregard longitudinal charge

separation, [7].

Finally, all thermal eﬀects will be disregarded since, at these high intensities, electrons are

driven to relativistic velocities in just a few optical cycles and the electron pressure gradient is

3

negligible compared to the ponderomotive pressure, [15].

These assumptions deﬁne the model we are using to describe our plasma: The ions are consid-

ered as an immobile neutralizing background and the electrons as a cold relativistic ﬂuid. Our

set of self-consistent equations derived from Maxwell’s equations and the equation of motion

for the electron component, assuming the Coulomb gauge, reads

potential, ϕ is the electrostatic scalar potential and ψ is a scalar function which expresses the

electron canonical momentum. Details on the derivation of this model can be found in [8].

Eqs.(3) and (4) imply that we are assuming vortex-free motion of the electrons. Taking the

divergence of Eq.(1) and using Eqs.(2) and (5) we ﬁnd that the charge conservation law

is automatically satisﬁed, i.e., the total charge is conserved. However, when dealing with

necessarily simpliﬁed models describing the stationary regime in presence of electron cavitation

phenomena, the condition of plasma quasineutrality is not obviously conserved, [11–13]. This

point must be carefully discussed when constructing new solutions and it will lead to the

breaking of the Hamiltonian model, thus allowing for multi-ﬁlament structures.

The assumption made on the pulse duration implies that the electron ﬂuid has time to

approach a quasi-steady state, [16]. Therefore, it is interesting to describe what kind of sta-

tionary state the system will reach, neglecting any transient phenomena. This leads to further

simpliﬁcation, because we can neglect the time dependence in Eq.(4) and, since v before the

passage of the laser pulse must be zero, it follows from Eqs.(3) and (4) that ψ = 0.

In order to single out the fast optical time scale we adopt the slowly varying envelope

approximation, factorizing the normalized vector potential as:

Assuming the paraxial approximation k⊥ << h, where k⊥ is the transverse component of the

laser wavenumber and h is the propagation constant, the parallel component of the vector

potential is negligible if compared to the transverse ones and the incident radiation may be

assumed to be circularly polarized without loss of generality.

In what follows, we will drop

III. COMMON ANALYSIS

Let us consider a two dimensional geometry for a plasma extending in the z direction, i.e.

along the laser propagation direction. We will restrict ourselves to a 1D transverse model in

order to emphasize the main features of multi-ﬁlament structures. In Eqs.(8)-(11) the prop-

agation constant h plays the role of a free parameter which, together with the background

plasma density no, deﬁnes what kind of ﬁlament structures can be realized as a ﬁnal state of

the self-focusing evolution. In reality, it would depend on several parameters and factors as

5

6
the laser power, the geometrical conﬁguration (the angle of focusing, for instance) and on the

prehistory of the process.

The self-channeling we are interested in is realized only when α > 1, i.e., for underdense

plasmas when 1 > h/k > √1

n0 and for overdense plasmas with n0 > 1 when h/k < 1.

−

The complete mathematical analogy between the present model and the one introduced in

[17] suggests that our plasma will react to the laser action with the formation of regions depleted

of electrons, where the laser electromagnetic radiation is trapped, a consequence of the well

known phenomenon of electron cavitation and channeling. Electrons tend to be expelled from

the focal spot by the laser ponderomotive force and, at the same time under such extreme

conditions, they acquire relativistic quiver velocities. These eﬀects both contribute to a self-

induced modiﬁcation of the radial proﬁle of the refractive index and a consequent nonlinear

trapping of the laser radiation in ﬁnite plasma regions. This modiﬁcation is the basic mechanism

in the optical guiding of laser pulses in plasmas.

It is possible to give an exact analytical

description of the asymptotic stationary plasma-ﬁeld structures generated in the transverse

direction for diﬀerent values of α. As we will see, these structures consist of one or more

channels, depending on the corresponding incident power. The most delicate point in the

analysis, will be the determination of such structures complying with global charge conservation.

Eqs. (8)-(11) were analyzed in detail in [13] and also in [18] with respect to both underdense and

overdense plasmas and solutions were found in the form of continuous functions. Fundamental

to those analysis is the Hamiltonian structure of the set of equations (8)-(11), which reads

where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the transverse coordinate x. As n(x)

and both a(x) and a′(x) vanish for x

, the integral of motion equals

It follows that there is an exact soliton-like analytical solution given by

It should be emphasized that, for α

1.5, since the system is fully described by the

≤

Hamiltonian (13), there are no other structures except this single-ﬁlament ones.

The important question is what will happen for higher incident powers or, in other words,

for α > 1.5? The procedure for constructing a solution followed in [12,13,15], which consisted

in assuming the electron density to vanish within the interval where the solution for the density

(16) is negative, led to non conservation of the global charge. However, what is happening is

that the ponderomotive force is pushing electrons away from the central axis, while the force

due to charge separation acts in the opposite direction. Thus, when an equilibrium is reached,

we have the formation of a stationary structure consisting of a channel emptied of its electrons.

This means that the global structure of the solution consists of two parts, the ﬁrst one described

by the Hamiltonian (13) while the second, describing the depletion regions where the electron

density vanishes, has the typical vacuum Hamiltonian:

HV =

(a′2 + a2).

represents the trajectory in the case of four ﬁlaments. Solid lines represent trajectories relative to

electron layers while dashed lines are relative to depletion regions and the large dashed line separates

regions with positive and negative electron density, as follows from Eq. (16).

The continuous soliton-like solution described by (15) corresponds here to the separatrix

trajectory and its starting and ﬁnal point is a = 0, a′ = 0. As pointed out, this solution breaks

down for higher values of α and we indicate on the phase portrait the curve beyond which the

electron density (16) formally becomes negative.

Beyond the limit curve for the electron density we have to introduce the ”vacuum” part of the

solution. Our system has left the separatrix and has started to move along the vacuum one.

The boundary position up to which the electrons are displaced is determined by the equilibrium

condition between the two forces acting on them, as described by the equation of motion

φ′ = γ′

9

(18)

and by the conservation of the total charge, which means that, in order to conserve the total

charge, the boundary positions can now be determined by inserting the equilibrium condition

(18) into Poisson’s equation and integrating it.

we present here also the total power calculated within the previous model, when the boundary

position xd was assumed to be the one where the electron density vanished.

In this case,

the total charge being not conserved, there was an excess of positive charge which led to a

much higher power required in order to overcome the restoring force due to this charge excess.

Consequently, the power needed to generate such structures was overestimated. Besides, it

is interesting to see how, for increasing values of α and consequently increasing values of the

required power, the width of the central vacuum channel becomes larger but, after the initial

rapid growth, its increase becomes slower, see the box in Fig.6.

V. MULTI-FILAMENT STRUCTURES

It is evident from our analysis that, due to the requirements of global charge conservation

and to the symmetry imposed with respect to the z-axis, for a ﬁxed α the single ﬁlament

conﬁguration and the power necessary to generate this structure are uniquely determined. If

this power is exceeded, the incident electromagnetic radiation is strong enough to spread along

the transverse direction of the plasma channel over a distance larger than in the previous

case, but still ﬁnite. For a suﬃciently strong power, the ﬁnal stationary state will present a

multiple channel structure which can again be analytically described. The power necessary for

generating each of these structures can be exactly calculated as well. As we will show, this

allows for the deﬁnition of a threshold power for the generation of multi-ﬁlament structures.

Let us start with the case of an intensity distribution with a minimum on the symmetry

axis. An example of the trajectory in the phase space for the double channel case is given in

Fig. 3(b), indicated as (0

0). To construct the ﬁeld structure we can start

−
, where we know the integral of motion and the

→

expression for the decaying ﬁeld and the electron density, see Eqs. (15) and (16) respectively.

When we come to the depletion region there is a certain freedom in the choice of the boundary

amplitude ad, as we are going backwards from the last plasma region towards the central axis.

The only requirement for ad is that the electron density must not be negative, therefore we can

ﬁx the boundary amplitude (and therefore the boundary position xd as well) to any value up

to a maximum for which the density at the boundary vanishes. This means that, for a ﬁxed

α the two peak solution is not unique and there is a certain power range for generating such a

structure. For a given ad the ﬁeld in the vacuum region,

is completely determined from the matching conditions, but now the vacuum channel extends

a(x) = AV cos(x

ϕ),

−

(24)

12

from the xd to a certain x1 (see Fig. 7) which is to be determined taking into account charge

conservation.

In order to construct a structure with only one degree of complexity more than for the single

channel, we stop at the next plasma layer, which will be centered on the symmetry axis. An

analytical expression for the ﬁeld in this central plasma layer can be derived by solving the

equation for the vector potential. Now the solution is not localized as before, therefore the

boundary conditions and the Hamiltonian

turbation propagating along the transverse direction. Otherwise, we can numerically calculate

how the minimum boundary intensity, such that Eq. (26) still has a solution, depends on α and

also ﬁnd a solution of this equation and calculate x1. To ﬁnally obtain a complete description

of the central plasma layer we only have to apply the boundary conditions at x1 to determine
HE1 and x(1), while the symmetry axis is determined
as the symmetry axis of the elliptic function. In Fig.7 a double-channel structure is shown for

the parameters that are still unknown,

ﬁxed α and for maximum amplitude at the last boundary (so that the electron density at this

boundary vanishes). It should be noticed that, for a ﬁxed value of the boundary amplitude

ad, the width of the vacuum channels and the peak intensity in these channels increase with

α. Furthermore, the maximum possible boundary amplitude itself is an increasing function

of α and, for any given value of this parameter, such a maximum amplitude determines the

maximum power we can deliver to the plasma in order to generate a double-channel structure.

Exceeding this maximum power will force the system to generate a structure with one more

ﬁlament and therefore we can talk about a threshold power for the generation of multi-ﬁlament

structures.

The apparently anomalous behaviour for low boundary intensities is due to the fact that

the left branch corresponds to a new kind of two-ﬁlament solution whose phase portrait ﬁeld

FIG. 9. (a) Phase portrait for a system that develops a double-ﬁlament structure.

In this case

the ﬁeld amplitude never vanishes apart from

on the separatrix. The corresponding plasma-ﬁeld

structures are illustrated in part (b).

The solution we have constructed and the corresponding choice of a closed one-cycle trajec-

tory in the phase space is not unique. We can pass a depletion region not only at the point 3

to form a one cycle trajectory, but also at the point b′ in order to create a periodic trajectory

a′, see Figs. 3(b) and 9(a). Following this trajectory means that we will have

a new structure with new channels and plasma layers, which were not present in the double

channel structure previously described.

We would like to underline the fact that the periodic trajectory shown in Fig. 3 corresponds

to a particular conﬁguration as the points b′, a′, a, b are related by a complete symmetry. It is

possible to see what this means by looking at the ﬁeld structures described by such a trajectory

(see Fig. 10): The central channels are completely symmetric, at each boundary we have the

same intensity. It is again the request of global charge conservation which leads, by integrating

Poisson’s equation, to a transcendental equation for the ﬁeld at the boundary of the new plasma

layer:

This equation is similar to Eq.(23) but now the Hamiltonian value

HE1 is the one deﬁned
for the new electron layer. In the case of a single-peak ﬁeld distribution, this equation had a

unique solution, consequently we can add to the two-ﬁlament distribution whole periodic cycles,

i.e., even numbers of ﬁlaments by jumping to consecutive vacuum trajectories at the point b

FIG. 12. Total power as a function of α for the three diﬀerent cases: single channel (continuous

last boundary was chosen as the maximum possible one.

The same procedure that we have described, may also be applied to the case presented in

Fig.9 where an integer number of ﬁlaments can be added since a full cycle occurs within a

half-space of the phase portrait.

Therefore, by using this procedure, we can construct multi-ﬁlament solutions that exist only

for α > 1.5 and represent plasma channels with electron cavitation. They diﬀer from each other

because of the laser power transported along these channels and, as there is a minimum laser

power required for exciting such structures, we can deﬁne the power thresholds for creating

non-single ﬁlament structures.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have presented an exact analysis of self-channeling structures generated

as a consequence of the relativistic self-focusing due to the interaction of ultra-intense laser

radiation with an underdense plasma. In this analysis, the plasma quasineutrality condition is

accurately taken into consideration and this quantitatively aﬀects some results on channeling

laser power. The essential point of the analysis is that it allows us to prove the multi-ﬁlament

nature of the relativistic self-focusing and to calculate the threshold power for exciting multi-

ﬁlament structures. Such a result is not achievable in media with a local nonlinearity, like the

Kerr one, because the governing equation has an overall Hamiltonian structure. In the case we

have analyzed, each electron cavitation channel corresponds to a certain part of the trajectory

followed by the system in the phase space, each part with its own Hamiltonian value, as shown

in Fig.3. Concerning the deﬁnition of a threshold power, it is interesting to notice how ﬁlament

structures with regions depleted of their electrons can be generated by the interaction if the

parameter α is greater than 1.5. For α

1.5 we have only single ﬁlament ﬁeld structures, with

≤

no depletion regions. As soon as α exceeds 1.5 there are plasma regions that are emptied of

their electrons and the number of ﬁlaments thus generated increases with increasing incident

power. We can therefore deﬁne the maximum power incident on a plasma with α = 1.5 as

the real threshold power for generating non-single ﬁlament structures (see Fig.1(b)). The same

construction procedure followed for the single-ﬁlament solution can then be easily extended to a

more realistic axisymmetrical case to obtain the analogous of Figs. (5) and (7) , while a real 2D

transverse approach is needed for the multi-ﬁlament structure problem, especially for the case

presented in Fig.(8) where a number of equal ﬁlaments have been added to the fundamental

structure.

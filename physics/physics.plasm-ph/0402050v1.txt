Abstract

Ruhr–Universit¨at Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany

The linear and nonlinear properties of the Rao-dust-magnetohydrodynamic (R-D-MHD) waves

in a dusty magnetoplasma are studied. By employing the inertialess electron equation of mo-

tion, inertial ion equation of motion, Amp`ere’s law, Faraday’s law, and the continuity equation

in a plasma with immobile charged dust grains, the linear and nonlinear propagation of two-

dimensional R-D-MHD waves are investigated.

In the linear regime, the existence of immobile

dust grains produces the Rao cutoﬀ frequency, which is proportional to the dust charge density

and the ion gyrofrequency. On the other hand, the dynamics of an amplitude modulated R-D-MHD

waves is governed by the cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. The latter has been derived by

using the reductive perturbation technique and the two-timescale analysis which accounts for the

harmonic generation nonlinearity in plasmas. The stability of the modulated wave envelope against

non-resonant perturbations is studied. Finally, the possibility of localized envelope excitations is

discussed.

INTRODUCTION

A wide variety of electrostatic and electromagnetic oscillatory modes are known to prop-

agate in unmagnetized and magnetized plasmas [1, 2]. Since more than a decade ago, it

has been pointed out, and is now well established, that the presence of heavy charged dust

particulates in a plasma may strongly modify the dispersion properties of the known low-

frequency modes, and may also introduce novel waves [3, 4]. For instance, inclusion of the

dust particle dynamics in an unmagnetized dusty plasma gives rise to the dust-acoustic

waves [5], while the modiﬁcation of the plasma constituents’ charge balance is responsible

for the dust ion-acoustic waves [6], characterized by an increased phase speed in comparison

with the acoustic speed in an electron-ion plasma without dust.

In a magnetized dusty

plasma, a variety of new modes have been shown to exist, including modiﬁed Alfv´en waves

[7] propagating along to the direction of the external magnetic ﬁeld B, as well as the modiﬁed

magnetoacoustic [8, 9] and drift-electromagnetic [10] waves propagating across B.

In this paper, we will focus on the linear and nonlinear properties of the Rao-dust-

magnetohydrodynamic (R-D-MHD) waves [9] in two space dimensions. The dispersion

characteristics of the two-dimensional (2D) R-D-MHD waves diﬀer from the ordinary mag-

netosonic waves propagating in a magnetized electron–ion (e–i) plasma; of particular im-

portance is the existence of a novel cutoﬀ frequency due to the presence of charged dust

grains, as ﬁrst reported by Rao in his classic paper [9]. Apart from being interesting from a

fundamental point of view, and not so widely studied so far, the R-D-MHD waves have been

recently shown [11] to be excited by the upper-hybrid waves in a uniform dusty magneto-

plasma. Our objective here is twofold: i) to present two-dimensional R-D-MHD modes, ii)

to study the amplitude modulation of ﬁnite amplitude 2D R-D-MHD waves. Assuming the

existence of a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld and relying on the two-ﬂuid model description,

we will calculate analytically the harmonic response of the system to a small displacement

from equilibrium, trying to point out the role of the dust. The nonlinear modulation of

the wave’s amplitude will then be considered by making use of an appropriate reductive

perturbation method [12, 13, 14]. The R-D-MHD wave stability will then be investigated

and the existence of envelope excitations will be discussed.

The manuscript is organized in the following fashion. In Sec. II, we present the govern-

ing equations for the R-D-MHD waves. Linearized equations and harmonic solutions are

2

presented in Sec. III. Considering oblique nonlinear amplitude modulations of ﬁnite ampli-

tude R-D-MHD waves, we derive the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation in Sec. IV. A stability

analysis is carried out in Sec. V. Section VI contains a discussion of localized R-D-MHD

modes. Our conclusions are highlighted in Sec. VII.

II. THE MODEL

We consider a three-component fully ionized dusty plasma composed of electrons (mass

m, charge e), ions (mass mi, charge qi = +Zie) and heavy charged dust particulates (mass

md, charge qd = s Zde), henceforth denoted by e, i, d respectively. Dust mass and charge

will be taken to be constant, for simplicity. Note that both negative and positive dust charge

cases are considered, distinguished by the charge sign s = sgn qd =

The plasma is immersed in a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld along the ˆz

direction:

particles are assumed to be practically immobile (‘frozen’ i.e. nd ≈

Note that Eqs. (8) – (11) lead to a novel low-frequency electromagnetic mode, associated

with the presence of charged dust grains, as was recently shown in Ref. [10]; cf. Eqs. (4),

(6) – (8) therein.

The system of equations (10), (11) is not closed in B and ui, since it also involves ne and

ni (both variable), unless one limits the analysis to small (ﬁrst order) perturbations from

equilibrium. Otherwise, for a consistent description, one should either use the complete

system of Eqs. (1) – (6) or retain Eqs. (1), (3), (5), (6) and (8) instead. In the following,

we will adopt the former option.

The set of equations (1) to (6) is a closed system describing the evolution of the state

vector S = (ne, ni, ue, ui, E, B). By assuming that no other vector quantity has a compo-

nent along the magnetic ﬁeld B = B ˆz = (B0 + B1) ˆz, viz. E = 0 + E1 = (Ex, Ey, 0), and

IV. OBLIQUE NONLINEAR AMPLITUDE MODULATION

Let us consider the system (12) – (20), which describes the evolution of the (nine scalar)

components of S:

ne, ni; ue,x, ue,y; ui,x, ui,y; Ex, Ey; B1}

.

{

In order to study the amplitude modulation of the R-D-MHD waves presented in

the previous section, we will assume small deviations from the equilibrium state S(0) =
ne,0, ni,0; 0, 0; 0, 0; 0, 0; B0}

by taking

{

S = S(0) + ǫ S(1) + ǫ2 S(2) + ... = S(0) +

ǫn S(n) ,

∞

Xn=1

where ǫ

1 is a smallness parameter. Following the standard multiple scale (reductive

perturbation) technique [12, 13], we shall consider the stretched (slow) space and time

variables

ζ = ǫ(x

λ t) ,

τ = ǫ2 t ,

−

(34)

where λ, having dimensions of velocity, is a real parameter to be later deﬁned. In order to

allow for an oblique amplitude modulation on the R-D-MHD wave, we will assume that all

perturbed states depend on the fast scales via the phase θ1 = k

is met by all state variables. Note that the (choice of)

direction of the propagation remains arbitrary, yet modulation is allowed to take place in

an oblique direction, characterized by the angle variable θ. Accordingly, the wave-number

vector k is taken to be k = (kx, ky) = (k cos θ, k sin θ). According to these considerations,

the derivative operators in the above equations are treated as follows

By substituting the above expressions into Eqs. (12) – (20) and isolating distinct orders in

ǫ, we obtain a set of (nine) reduced equations at each (nth-) order, describing the evolution of

the (nine) components of S(n). The system is then solved (for each harmonic l), substituted

into the subsequent order, and so forth. This is a rather standard procedure in the reductive

perturbation method framework [12, 13, 14], and we shall not burden the presentation

with unnecessary details. The outcome of the long algebraic calculation is presented in the

following, while essential details are presented in the Appendix.

The ﬁrst order (n = 1) ﬁrst harmonic (l = 1) equations are just as described in the

previous section. Recall the (parabolic) form of the dispersion relation (23), which arises as

a compatibility condition. The amplitudes of the ﬁrst harmonics of the perturbation, say
A(1)
1,j (j = 1, ..., 9) (i.e. precisely ˆAj,1 in the previous Section), then come out to be directly

9

proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld perturbation, viz. A(1)

1 ; the coeﬃcients c(11)
are deﬁned in (26) – (33) above. Only the ﬁrst harmonics have a contribution at this order;

1,j = c(11)

j B(1)

j

indeed, for n = 1, l = 0, one obtains a (6
(6 components of) ue, ui, E; interestingly, the determinant D(1)

×

6) linear homogeneous system of equations for the

Ωc,iq2

d is non-zero due to

0 ∼

(and only in) the presence of dust, so we obtain the trivial solution for the zeroth-harmonic
contribution, u(1)

0 = 0. In addition, n(1)

0 = 0, as imposed by the

e,0 = n(1)

i,0 = B(1)

i,0 = E(1)

e,0 = u(1)
(n = 2, l = 0) equations.

A. Second order in ǫ: group velocity, 0th and 2nd harmonics

The second order (n = 2) equations for the ﬁrst harmonics provide the compatibility con-

dition: λ = ∂ω/∂kx = ω′(k) cos θ, which deﬁnes λ as the group velocity vg = (C 2k/ω) cos θ

(the characteristic velocity C was deﬁned previously). The 2nd-order corrections to the ﬁrst
harmonic amplitudes, say A(2)
1,j (j = 1, ..., 9), come out to be A(2)
coeﬃcients c(21)

are presented in the Appendix.

1 /∂ζ, where the

1,j = c(21)

j ∂B(1)

As expected, second order harmonic contributions arise in this order; their amplitudes,

deﬁned by the equations for n = 2, l = 2, are found to be proportional to the square of the
ﬁrst order elements, e.g. in terms of B(1)

1 )2. The nonlinear self-interaction
of the carrier wave also results in the creation of a zeroth harmonic, to this order; its strength

2,j = c(22)

1 : A(2)

(B(1)

j

is analytically determined by taking into account the l = 0 component of the 3rd and 4th

order reduced equations. The result is conveniently expressed in terms of the square modulus

of the (n = 1, l = 1) quantities, e.g. in terms of
(j = 1, ..., 9); once more, the deﬁnitions of c(22)

B. Derivation of the Nonlinear Schr¨odinger Equation

Proceeding to the third order in ǫ (n = 3), the equation for l = 1 yields an explicit

compatibility condition to be imposed in the right-hand side of the evolution equations

which, given the expressions derived previously, can be cast into the form of the Nonlinear

Quite surprisingly, Q comes out to be independent of the angle θ. However, as expected,

the presence of charged dust grains in the charge balance equation (7) strongly aﬀects the

numerical value of Q; notice, in passing, that this expression is not valid in the absence of

dust grains (since the denominator then vanishes).

The last expression for Q can be conveniently re-arranged, by making use of appropriate

plasma quantities. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne the dust parameter: µ = ne,0/(Zini,0); see that:

µ = 1 + s (Zdnd,0)/(Zini,0), due to (7), so a value lower/higher than 1 corresponds to

negative/positive dust charge sign; µ obviously tends to unity in the absence of dust (in any

case, µ

0). Check that µ = (1

V. STABILITY ANALYSIS

The modulational stability proﬁle of a carrier wave whose amplitude is described by the

NLS Equation (35) has long been studied, so only the main results have to be summarized

here [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].

The analysis consists in considering the linear stability of the monochromatic (Stokes’s

wave) solution of the NLSE (35) ψ = ˆψ eiQ|ψ|2τ + c.c..

If the product P Q of the NLS

coeﬃcients is positive, the wave’s envelope may develop an instability when subject to an
external perturbation characterized by a wavenumber ˆk lower than ˆkcr =

. The
then reaches its maximum value for ˆk = ˆkcr/√2, viz.
2. On the other hand, the wave will be stable for all values of ˆk if the product

P Q is negative.

In our case, the dispersion coeﬃcient P is positive, so one need only investigate the sign

of the nonlinearity coeﬃcient Q, which is entirely determined by the quantity in brackets in

the right-hand-side of (38); this is in fact a bi-quadratic polynomial of K, say p(K, µ). It is

a matter of straightforward algebra to show (and an easy matter to conﬁrm, numerically)

that p(K, µ) (and Q) is negative for values of µ below µcr = 25.1146, i.e. for all values of

the wavenumber x. Therefore, for negative dust charge (s =

1 i.e. µ < 1), the wave will

−

always be stable. On the other hand, for positive dust charge (s = +1 i.e. µ > 1), the wave

may become unstable (only) for values of µ above µcr i.e. in the case of positive dust charge

concentration qdnd higher than

24qini (a very rare situation, physically speaking, which

≈

implies a very high ion depletion in the plasma). The numerical value of Q, as expressed

by relation (39), is roughly depicted in ﬁgure 1 versus the wavenumber K and the dust

12

parameter µ. As predicted above, Q (and P Q) only reaches positive values for µ beyond

25 and K above

≈
situation. We conclude that the R-D-MHD waves are modulationally stable, in the presence

10 (i.e. k > 10ωp,i/c), which is a hardly ever realizable physical

≈

of negatively charged dust grains, and (practically) also for positively charged ones.

VI. LOCALIZED MODES

Diﬀerent types of envelope excitations (solitons) are known to satisfy Eq. (35); in speciﬁc,

one ﬁnds bright- (dark- or grey-) type solitons, e.g. pulses (holes) for a positive (negative)

value of the coeﬃcient product P Q [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], as already long known from nonlinear

optics [18, 19]. According to the conclusions of the preceding Section, the R-D-MHD waves

considered in this study will (in the majority of physically realizable situations) rather favour

dark-type localized excitations, i.e. ﬁeld dips (voids) propagating at a constant proﬁle,

thanks to the balance between the wave dispersion and nonlinearity. The analytical form of

these excitations, depicted in Fig. 2, reads ψ(ζ, τ ) =

ρ(ζ, τ ) ei Θ(ζ,τ ), where

L (cid:19)(cid:21)

(cid:18)

(42)

where a is a real parameter measuring the depth of the ﬁeld void: 0 < a < 1 (a = 1)

corresponds to grey (black) solitons; see Fig. 2a (2b). The complex expressions for the

parameters a and Θ in the above expression (as well as related ones for bright solitons) can

readily be found in the references [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and are omitted here. Note,

however, that the width L of (both bright- and dark-types of) these localized excitations

depends on the maximum amplitude ρ0 as L =

P/(Q ρ0)

; therefore, we retain that for a

2
q

|

|

given amplitude, the (absolute value of the) coeﬃcient ratio P/Q expresses the square width

of the soliton, i.e. a pulse if P Q > 0 and a hole if P Q < 0. Inversely, for a ﬁxed width L,

the quotient P/Q expresses the amplitude (height) of the solitary wave ρ0.

In ﬁgures 3 – 8 we have depicted the ratio P/Q as expressed by the relations (38),

(41), expressed in units, say: P0/Q0 =

lower values (with a maximum for higher K) as µ decreases; therefore, an increase in the

concentration of negative dust results in generally narrower excitations, but with a peak at

higher wavenumbers K. Also, for a given K, the width is maximum for a certain value of µ

13

(see Fig. 3b); the position of the maximum depends only slightly on θ but rather strongly

on K (see Figs. 4a, b). Finally, for a ﬁxed value of µ, the P/Q vs. K curve seems to have

a maximum at θ = π/2; see Fig. 5: transverse modulation slightly favours higher soliton

widths. This maximum moves to higher K with increasing dust (i.e. decreasing µ); cf. Figs.

For positive dust (µ > 1), see Figs. 6 – 8, we have similar qualitative results, yet generally

lower values. Once more, the angle variable does not seem to inﬂuence the soliton proﬁle

5a, 5b.

dramatically.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have studied the 2D linear and nonlinear propagation of R-D-MHD

waves in a uniform cold magnetoplasma composed of electrons, ions, and charged dust grains.

The presence of immobile charged dust grains is responsible for the ion rotation and a new

cutoﬀ frequency (non-existing in an ordinary e–i plasma), which were reported by Rao in his

classic paper [9]. The propagation of the modiﬁed dust magnetoacoustic waves is possible

due to the ﬁnite ion inertia eﬀect. The charged dust modiﬁes the phase speed of the modiﬁed

magnetosonic waves. Furthermore, we have considered the amplitude modulation of the R-

D-MHD waves and have shown that self-interactions among waves result in the harmonic

generation and the amplitude modulation of a carrier R-D-MHD wave. The wave envelope

has been shown to be stable against perturbations in a wide range of physical parameter

spaces. Finally, we have discussed the possibility of localized envelope excitations (mostly

of the dark soliton type i.e. localized ﬁeld dips propagating in the plasma) associated with

the nonlinear R-D-MHD.

Figure Captions

The value of the coeﬃcient Q is depicted against the dust parameter µ and the (normal-

ized) wavenumber K.

Figure 1.

Figure 2.

Soliton solutions of the NLS equation for P Q < 0 (holes); these excitations are of: (a) dark

type, (b) grey type. Notice that the amplitude never reaches zero in (b). These excitations

represent electromagnetic ﬁeld dips (voids) associated with the nonlinear R-D-MHD wave

propagation.

Figure 3.

Figure 4.

Figure 5.

Figure 6.

Negative dust; the (normalized) soliton width L (absolute value of P/Q) is depicted: (a)

against wavenumber K, for θ = 0 and µ = 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5 (from top to bottom); (b) against

the dust parameter µ, for K = 0.2 and θ = 0◦, 30◦, 60◦, 90◦ (from bottom to top).

Negative dust; the (normalized) soliton width L (absolute value of P/Q) is depicted

versus the dust parameter µ and the angle θ for: (a) K = 0.2; (b) K = 0.5.

Negative dust; the soliton width L (absolute value of P/Q) is depicted versus the

wavenumber K and the angle θ for: (a) µ = 0.8; (b) µ = 0.5.

Similar to Fig. 3, for positive dust; the (normalized) soliton width (absolute value of

P/Q) is depicted: (a) against wavenumber K, for θ = 0 and µ = 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 (from top

to bottom); (b) against the dust parameter µ, for K = 0.2 and θ = 0◦, 30◦, 60◦, 90◦ (from

bottom to top).

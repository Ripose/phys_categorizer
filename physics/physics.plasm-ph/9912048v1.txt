The dynamic structure factor ˜S(k, ω) and the two-particle
distribution function g(r, t) of ions in a Coulomb crystal are
obtained in a closed analytic form using the harmonic lattice
(HL) approximation which takes into account all processes
of multi-phonon excitation and absorption. The static ra-
dial two-particle distribution function g(r) is calculated for
classical (T >∼ ¯hωp, where ωp is the ion plasma frequency)
and quantum (T ≪ ¯hωp) body-centered cubic (bcc) crys-
tals. The results for the classical crystal are in a very good
agreement with extensive Monte Carlo (MC) calculations at
1.5 <∼ r/a <∼ 7, where a is the ion-sphere radius. The HL
Coulomb energy is calculated for classical and quantum bcc
and face-centered cubic crystals, and anharmonic corrections
are discussed. The inelastic part of the HL static structure
(k), averaged over orientations of wave-vector k, is
factor S
shown to contain pronounced singularities at Bragg diﬀrac-
tion positions. The type of the singularities is diﬀerent in
classical and quantum cases. The HL method can serve as a
useful tool complementary to MC and other numerical meth-
ods.

I. INTRODUCTION

A model of a Coulomb crystal of point charges in
a uniform neutralizing background of charges of oppo-
site sign is widely used in various branches of physics.
The model was originally proposed by Wigner [1] who
showed that zero-temperature electron gas immersed into
uniform background of positive charges crystallizes into
body-centered cubic (bcc) Coulomb crystal at suﬃciently
low density. Since then the model has been used in solid
state physics for describing electron-hole plasma (e.g.,
Ref. [2]) and in plasma physics for describing dusty plas-
mas and ion plasmas in Penning traps (e.g., Ref. [3]).
Finally, Coulomb crystals of ions on almost uniform back-
ground of degenerate electron gas are known to be formed
in the cores of white dwarfs and the envelopes of neutron
stars. Consequently, properties of Coulomb crystals are
important for studying structure and evolution of these
astrophysical objects (e.g., Ref. [4]).

As classical examples of strongly coupled systems, the

Coulomb crystals have been the subject of extensive stud-
ies by various numerical methods, mostly by Monte Carlo
(MC; e.g., [5], and references therein), and also by molec-
ular dynamics (MD; e.g., Ref. [6]), and path-integral
Monte Carlo (PIMC; e.g, Ref. [7]). Although the results
of these studies are very impressive, the numerical meth-
ods are time consuming and require the most powerful
computers.

The aim of the present article is to draw attention to a
simple analytic model of Coulomb crystals. It has been
employed recently in Ref. [8] in connection with trans-
port properties of degenerate electrons in strongly cou-
pled plasmas of ions. We will show that this model is a
useful tool for studying static and dynamic properties of
Coulomb crystals themselves.

For certainty, consider a Coulomb crystal of ions im-
mersed in a uniform electron background. Let ˆρ(r, t) =
ˆri(t)) be the Heisenberg representation opera-
tor of the ion number density, where ˆri(t) is the operator
P
of the ith ion position. The spatial Fourier harmonics of
i e−ık·ˆri(t). The

Along with the HL model we will also use the simpli-

by integration over k (e.g., transport properties of degen-
erate electrons in Coulomb crystals of ions).

III. STATIC CASE. HL VERSUS MC

In this section we compare our analytic models with
MC simulations of Coulomb crystals. For this purpose
we introduce the function

which may be called the static two particle radial distri-
bution function. This function is the result of an angular
and a translation average of the static two particle dis-
tribution function.
In this expression dΩr is the solid
angle element in the direction of r. One can see that
4πr2ng(r)dr is the ensemble averaged number of ions in
a spherical shell of radius r and width dr centered at a
given ion. Thus g(r) is just the quantity determined from
MC simulations [5].

First let us use the HL1 model. From Eqs. (6) and (12)

we easily obtain g1(r) = g′(r) + g′′

1 (r), where

g′(r) = 1 +

where γ = (r + σRµ)/x, η = 3(r + σR)2/(4r2
cos ϑ, ϑ is an angle between k and R, x2 = 4[r2
−
(kαkβvαβ(R, 0)/k2)], and dΩk is the solid angle element
in the direction of k. Therefore, we need to evaluate
a rapidly converging lattice sum (15) of 2D integrals in
which x is known once the matrix elements vαβ(R, 0)
are calculated from Eq. (10). We have performed the
integration over the ﬁrst Brillouin zone required in Eq.
(10) using the 3D Gauss integration scheme described in
Ref. [11].

The function g(r) depends on the lattice type and on
two parameters: the classical ion coupling parameter Γ =
Z 2e2/(aT ) and the quantum parameter θ = ¯hωp/T that
measures the importance of zero-point lattice vibrations.
In this case Ze is the ion charge, a = (4πn/3)−1/3 is the
ion sphere radius, and ωp = Ze
4πn/m the ion plasma
frequency.

First consider a classical Coulomb crystal, θ

0, for
T /(¯hων). The functions g(r) calculated using
which ¯nν ≈
the HL and HL1 models for body-centered cubic (bcc)
crystals at Γ = 180 and 800 are presented in Figs. 1
and 2. The pronounced peak structure corresponds to
the bcc lattice vectors. These results are compared with
extensive MC simulations. The MC method is described,
e.g., in Ref. [5]. The simulations have been done with 686
particles over nearly 108 MC conﬁgurations.

One can observe a very good agreement of HL and
MC results for both values of Γ at 1.5 <
7. The
∼
MC results for g(r) are limited to half the size of the
basic cell containing the N charges due to the bias from
particles in the image cells adjacent to the basic cell.
For N = 686 the basic cell length is 14.2 a. Hence the
MC g(r) results for this simulation are valid only out
7 a while g(r), given by the HL model, remains
to r
≈
. At small particle separations, r <
accurate as r
∼
1.5 a, where g(r) becomes small, the HL g(r) deviates
from the MC g(r). It is clear that the HL model cannot
be reliable at these r, where strong Coulomb repulsion
of two particles dominates, and the MC data (available
down to r >
1.1 a) are more accurate. The HL1 model is
quite satisfactory at r >
∼
2.5 a, beyond the closest lattice
∼
peak. The HL model improves signiﬁcantly HL1 at lower
r. It is interesting that for Γ = 180 the HL1 model agrees
slightly better with MC for the range 2.5 <
6 than
∼
the HL model does. With increasing Γ, however, the HL
model comes into better agreement with MC at these r,
although the diﬀerence between the HL and HL1 models
becomes very small. This good agreement of the HL
models with the MC simulations after the ﬁrst peak of
g(r) indicates that we have a very good description of
Coulomb crystals for which the HL model may be used
in place of MC simulations.

r/a <
∼

The HL model enables one to analyse quantum eﬀects.
Figs. 1 and 2 exhibit also g(r) in the quantum regime
at θ = 10. Zero-point lattice vibrations tend to reduce
lattice peaks. The simplicity of the implementation of
the HL model in the quantum regime is remarkable given
the complexity of direct numerical studies of the quantum
eﬀects by MC, PIMC or MD simulations (see, e.g., Ref.
[7]).

part of U1 in the HL1 model is given only by two terms,
U1/(N T ) = ζΓ+ u−2/2. We see that the HL1 model fails
to reproduce correctly the harmonic part of the potential
energy: u−2/2 appears instead of conventional 3/2.

To get a deeper insight into the HL and HL1 models
let us use them to calculate the electrostatic energy U of
the crystal. Writing this energy as the sum of Coulomb
energies of diﬀerent pairs of ions complemented by the
interaction energy of ions with the electron background
and the Coulomb energy of the background itself, we ar-

tion for the phonon spectrum) we see that the HL ex-
pansion of the analytic part of U in powers of T is
U/(N T ) = ζΓ + 3/2 + δUT /(N T );
it reproduces not
only the Madelung term, but also the correct oscilla-
tory term 3/2, and contains a higher-order contribution
2 /Γ2 + . . . that can be called
δUT /(N T ) = AHL
“anharmonic” contribution in the HL model. After some
transformations the coeﬃcients AHL
are re-
duced to the sums over R containing, respectively, bi-
linear and triple products of vαβ (with integration over
µ and φ done analytically). Numerically the sums yield
AHL

1 = 10.64 and AHL
62.4.
The anharmonic terms occur since U , as given by Eq.
(16), includes exact Coulomb energy (without expanding
the Coulomb potential in powers of ion displacements
u). However, we use g(r) in the HL approximation and
thus neglect the anharmonic contribution in ion-ion cor-
relations. Therefore, the HL model does not include all
anharmonic eﬀects.

Now let us set T = 0 and analyse the quantum eﬀects.
We can expand Eqs. (17) and (19) in powers of rT /a. For
T = 0 the quantity rT tends to the rms amplitude of zero-
3¯hu−1/(2mωp), where u−1 is
point vibrations, rT =
another phonon spectrum moment (=2.7986 and 2.7198
for bcc and fcc, respectively). The expansion of U1/N
gives ζZ 2e2/a+ u−1¯hωp/4 plus small non-analytic terms.
In the same manner as in Eq. (22) we ﬁnd that U/N =
ζZ 2e2/a + 3u1¯hωp/4 + δU0/N . The second term gives
half of the total (kinetic + potential) zero-point harmonic
energy of a crystal, as required by the virial theorem for
harmonic oscillator (u1 =0.51139 and 0.51319 for bcc and

zero-point anharmonic energy in the HL approximation.
To make the above algebra less abstract let us esti-
mate the accuracy of the HL model and the relative im-
portance of the anharmonicity and quantum eﬀects. In
the classical case, taking Γ = 170 (close to the melt-
ing value Γm = 172 for bcc), we estimate the anhar-
monic contribution to the total electrostatic energy as

Coulomb crystals can be regarded as highly harmonic,
and the accuracy of the HL model is suﬃcient for many
practical applications. Obviously, the accuracy becomes
even better with decreasing T . The quantum eﬀects can
be more important (than the anharmonicity) in real sit-
uations. Let us take 12C matter at density ρ = 106 g

For completeness we mention that the compressibility
of the electron background also contributes to the electro-
static energy. The relative contribution in the degenerate
electron case for 12C at ρ = 106 g cm−3 is
10−2 (e.g.,
Ref. [16]). Another point is that the HL model takes into
account zero-point lattice vibrations but neglects ion ex-
change which becomes important at very high densities
(e.g., Ref. [4]).

V. STRUCTURE FACTORS

Finally, it is tempting to use the HL model for an-
alyzing the ion structure factors themselves.
Con-
sider the angle-averaged static structure factor S(k) =
dΩkS(k, t = 0)/(4π). For the Bragg part, from Eq. (6)

we obtain the expression

containing delta-function singularities at k = G, lengths
of reciprocal lattice vectors G. Direct HL calculation of
S′′(k) from Eq. (9) is complicated by the slow conver-
gence of the sum and complex dependence of vαβ on R.
However, the main features of S′′(k) can be understood
from two approximations. First, in the HL1 model we
e−2W (k)
have vαβ (0, 0)kαkβ = 2W (k), and S′′
as shown by the dashed line in Fig. 3.

1 (k) = 1

−

The second, more realistic approximation will be
called HL2 (and labelled by the subscript ‘2’).
It
consists in adopting a simpliﬁed tensor decomposition
of vαβ(R, 0) of the form vαβ(R, 0) = F (R) δαβ +
RαRβJ(R)/R2. If so, we can immediately take the fol-
dΩR vαα(R, 0)/(4π) = 3F (R) + J(R)
lowing integrals
dΩR vαβ(R, 0)RαRβ/(4πR2) = F (R) + J(R) (as-
and
suming summation over repeating tensor indices α and
β). On the other hand, we can calculate the same inte-
grals taking vαβ(R, 0) from Eq. (10) at t = 0. In this
way we come to two linear equations for F (R) and J(R).
Solving them, we obtain

where y = qR, and j0(y) and j1(y) are the spherical
Bessel functions. Note that F (0)k2 = 2W (k), J(0) = 0.
In the limit of large R the functions j0(qR) and j1(qR)
in Eqs. (25) strongly oscillate which means that the main
contribution into the phonon averaging (integration over
q) comes from a small vicinity near the center of the Bril-
louin zone. Among three branches of phonon vibrations
in simple Coulomb crystals, two (s=1, 2) behave as trans-
verse acoustic modes, while the third (s=3) behaves as
ωp) near the center of
a longitudinal optical mode (ω
the Brillouin zone. Owing to the presence of ω−1
in the
denominator of Eqs. (25), the main contribution at large
R comes evidently from the acoustic modes. Thus we
can neglect optical phonons and set ω = csq for acoustic
modes, where cs is the mean ion sound velocity. In the

This expression explicitly reveals logarithmic singular-
ities at k = G. They come from inelastic processes of
one-phonon emission or absorption in the cases in which
given wave vector k is close to a reciprocal lattice vec-
tor G. To prove this statement let us perform Taylor
expansions of both exponentials in angular brackets in
Eq. (3). The one-phonon processes correspond to those
expansion terms which contain products of one creation
and one annihilation operator. Thus, in the one-phonon
approximation S′′(k, t = 0) reads

where the last summation is over phonon polarizations,

G is the phonon wave vector which is the given
wave vector k reduced into the ﬁrst Brillouin zone by
subtracting an appropriate reciprocal lattice vector G.
In addition,
in Eq. (30) we have introduced an over-
all factor e−2W (k) which comes from renormalization of
the one-phonon probability associated with emission and
absorption of any number of virtual phonons (e.g., Ref.
[9]). Now let us assume that

which contains exactly the same logarithmic divergency
we got in Eq. (29). Note that in the quantum limit we
would have similar integral but with ω instead of ω2 in
the denominator of the integrand. The integration would
yield the expression proportional to
, i.e., the log-

arithmic singularity would be replaced by a weaker kink-
like feature. Therefore, the k = G features of the inelastic
structure factor S′′(k) in the quantum limit are expected
to be less pronounced than in the classical limit but could
be, nevertheless, quite visible. Actually, at any ﬁnite

there are still phonons excited thermally near the very
center of the Brillouin zone, where the energy of acous-
tic phonons is smaller than temperature. Due to these
phonons the logarithmic singularity always exists on top
of the kink-like feature at T

= 0.

After this simpliﬁed consideration let us return to qual-
itative analysis. We have calculated S′′
2 (k) in the classical
limit using the HL2 approximation as prescribed above
and veriﬁed that the result is indeed independent of R0
(in the range from
30a to 100a) and A. The resulting
S′′

2 (k) is plotted in Fig. 3 by the solid line.

FIG. 3. Inelastic part of the structure factor at Γ = 180 for

classical bcc crystal.

Thus, in a crystal, the inelastic part of the structure
factor, S′′(k), appears to be singular in addition to the
Bragg (elastic) part S′(k). The singularities of S′′(k)
are weaker than the Bragg diﬀraction delta functions in
S′(k); the positions of singularities of both types coin-
cide. The pronounced shapes of the S′′(k) peaks may,
in principle, enable one to observe them experimentally.
The structure factor S(k) in the Coulomb liquid (see, e.g.,
Ref. [17] and references therein) also contains signiﬁcant
but ﬁnite and regular humps associated with short-range
order. This structure has been studied in detail by MC
and other numerical methods.
In contrast, the studies
of singular structure factors in a crystal by MC or MD
methods would be very complicated. Luckily, they can
be explored by the HL model.

Finally, it is instructive to compare the behavior of
S′′(k) at small k in the HL1 and HL2 models. It is easy
to see that the main contribution to inelastic scatter-
ing at these k comes from one-phonon normal processes
[with q=k in Eq. (30)]. At these k the HL2 S′′
2 (k) co-
incides with the one-phonon S′′
1ph(k) and with the static

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Thus, the harmonic lattice model allows one to study
static and dynamic properties of quantum and classical
Coulomb crystals. The model is relatively simple, espe-
cially in comparison with numerical methods like MC,
PIMC and MD. The model can be considered as com-
plementary to the traditional numerical methods. More-
over, it can be used to explore dynamic properties of the
Coulomb crystals and quantum eﬀects in the cases where
the use of numerical methods is especially complicated.
For instance, the harmonic lattice model predicts singu-
larities of the static inelastic structure factor at the posi-
tions of Bragg diﬀraction peaks. We expect also that the
HL model can describe accurately non-Coulomb crystals
whose lattice vibration properties are well determined.

Exact Solution of selfconsistent Vlasov equation

MPG - AG “Theoretical Many-Body Physics”, Universit¨at Rostock,D-18055 Rostock, Germany

An analytical solution of the selfconsistent Vlasov equation is presented. The time evolution is
entirely determined by the initial distribution function. The largest Lyapunov exponent is calculated
analytically. For special parameters of the model potential positive Lyapunov exponent is possible.
This model may serve as a check for numerical codes solving selfconsistent Vlasov equations. The
here presented method is also applicable for any system with analytical solution of the Hamilton
equation for the formfactor of the potential.

The selfconsistent Vlasov equation is one of the most
frequently used equations for the time dependent de-
scription of many-particle systems. Especially in nuclear
physics this equation has been employed to describe mul-
tifragmentation phenomena and collective oscillations.
The numerical demands are appreciable to solve this
equation in six phase space dimensions. It is apparently
not widely known that there exists an analytical solv-
able model from which the eﬀects of selfconsistency can
be studied. Here such a model is presented which shows
that selfconsistency can lead to positive Lyapunov expo-
nents. The explicit analytical solution provides a tool for
checking numerical codes.

The model single -particle Hamiltonian reads

dependence. Then the diﬀerential equation is a linear
partial one and can be solved easily.

We solve this equation by examining the diﬀerential
equations for the equipotential lines. This can be found
by rewriting (4) in the form of a sevendimensional gradi-
ent

(1,

, −~∂rV ).∂f = 0

~p
m

(5)

where ∂f = ( ˙f , ~∂r, ~∂p). Because of the fact that any
gradient is perpendicular to the hypersphere we can
see that any curve in this hyperplane, which can be
characterized by a parametric representation in the way
(p(s), r(s), t(s)), obeys the relation

H =

+ V (~r, t)

~p2
2m

where V (~r, t) is the mean ﬁeld potential associated with
the separable multipole-multipole force v1234 = µg12g34
resulting in

V (~r, t) = µg(~r)Q(t).

(2)

This model has been employed e.g in [1] for numerical
study of intrinsic chaoticity. We show in the following
that this is indeed a consequence of selfconsistency. The
selfconsistent solution requires

Q(t) =

d~rd~p
(2π)3 g(~r)f (~r, ~p, t)

where the one-particle distribution function obeys the

I. METHOD OF SOLUTION

A. Nonselfconsistent solution

First we solve the diﬀerential equation (4) in nonself-
consistent manner.
It means we consider the time de-
pendence of V due to selfconsistency as an external time

(1)

1 :

pi
m

: −∂riV = ˙t(s) : ˙ri(s) : ˙pi(s);

i = x, y, z.

(6)

From this we can read oﬀ the diﬀerential equations for
the hyperplane. Usually one eliminates the parameter s
choosing the time t as a parameter. The result is the well
known Hamilton equations

∂t~p = −~∂rV (r, t)
~p
m

∂t~r =

.

(7)

In the case we can solve this equations we would ob-
tain a sixdimensional parametric solution of the Vlasov
equation ci = ci(~p, ~r, t); i = 1 − 6. Here the ci are the
integration constants of (7). The general solution of the
diﬀerential equation (4) is given as any function of these
ci. This function itself is determined by the inital distri-
bution f0(~p0, ~r0). We reformulate the latter distribution
therefore as a function of the ci[~p0, ~r0, t = 0]

(3)

(4)

f0(~p0, ~r0) = fc(ci[~p0, ~r0, t = 0])

(8)

which represents a variable substitution from (~p0, ~r0) co-
ordinates into the new set of variables (ci). Therefore the
initial distribution f0(~p0, ~r0) is changed into fc(ci). The
general solution of the Vlasov equation at any time can
then be represented by

f (~p, ~r, t) = fc(ci[~p, ~r, t]).

(9)

We like to point out that instead of choosing the time as
a parameter we have also the possibility to eliminate s
in (6) by any variable pi or ri. This is especially helpfull
for other models because then the energy appears as an
explicit integral of motion.

B. Selfconsistency

Provided we know the nonselfconsistent solution (9) of
the Vlasov equation (4) we can easily built in selfcon-
sistency by employing (3). Introducing (9) into (3) we
obtain

Q(t) =

d~r0d~p0g(~r[ci[~r0, ~p0]])f0(p0, r0)

Z

∂(~r~p)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)

which produces a complicated equation for Q and mo-
ments of the initial distribution. If this can be solved,
eq. (9) is the selfconsistent solution when Q(t) is intro-
duced.

II. ANALYTICAL MODEL

Here we like to demonstrate the application of the
method by an exactly solvable model. We choose a form
factor of the form

such that the general solution of the Vlasov equation is
any function of these ci. Taking the initial distribution
as f0(~p, ~r) into account corresponding to (8) we see that
the general solution can be represented as

f (~p, ~r, t) = f0 (pi + µaiQ1(t),

ri +

Q2(t)

(cid:17)

(16)

One easily convince oneselves that this solution solves the
Vlasov equation (4).

The nonselfconsistent solution is given by writing the

time dependence of Q(t) and reads

fnon(~p, ~r, t) = f0 (pi + µaiQt,
Qt2 −t

ri − µai

.

Now we employ the selfconsistency condition (3) in order
to calculate Q(t). Therefore we shift coordinates in the
integral to obtain the form

Q(t) =

g(~r) = axx + ayy + azz.

(11)

For such a model system we can solve the Hamilton equa-
tions exactly. This is performed by diﬀerentiating the
second equation of (7) and inserting the ﬁrst one

Double occurring indices i are summed over. Here we

is entirely determined by the initial distribution function.
The further evolution is then given according to this ex-
plicit time dependence.

We see that we obtain in the case of µ > 0, which
means eﬀective repulsive force, an oscillatory solutions.
There is no chaotic behaviour.

positive Lyapunov exponents are generated under certain
potential parameters by selfconsistency. The model may
serve as a useful check of numerical codes.

III. SUMMARY

A method is presented to solve the selfconsistent
Vlasov equation. The following recipie is proposed which
is applicable for a model meanﬁeld V = µg(r)Q(t) if the
Hamiltion equations for this form factor g(r) are inte-
grable.

1. Solution of the diﬀerential equations for equipoten-
tial lines as a function of the nonselfconsistent (time
dependent) potential. The solution is a parametric
representation of the general solution.

2. The initial distribution has to be expressed into
this paramters. Then the time evolution is entirely
determined by this parametric form of the initial
distribution replacing the parameters by their time
dependent form as derived in 1.

3. The selfconsistency condition leads now to a gener-
ally highly involved equation for the selfconsistent
potential. This equation is derived using the non-
selfconsistent solution of 2., which is a function of
the potential by itself.

4. Reintroducing this selfconsistent potential into the
solution 2 the time evolution of the selfconsistent
Vlasov equation is determined completely by the
initial distribution.

Relativistic heat transport in electron-two-temperature plasmas with density gradients has been

investigated. The Legendre expansion analysis of relativistically modiﬁed kinetic equations shows

that strong inhibition of heat ﬂux appears in relativistic temperature regimes, suppressing the

classical Spitzer-H¨arm conduction. The Seebeck coeﬃcient, the Wiedemann-Franz law, and the

thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit are derived in the relativistic regimes.

The relativistic eﬀects of hot electrons in laboratory plasmas have attracted much inter-

ests in the past few decades [1], particularly, in the context of the current drive mode in

tokamaks and the electron cyclotron heating in various conﬁnement devices [2, 3]. In the

theoretical arena, Braams and Karney (BK) ﬁrst presented the relativistic Fokker-Planck

equations with the extended Rosenbluth potentials [4], and applied the equations to deriva-

tion of the relativistic electrical conductivity [5]. Using the BK collision integrals, Shoucri

and Shkarofsky developed a numerical code to survey the relativistic eﬀects on electron

cyclotron wave, fast wave, and lower hybrid current drive mode in tokamaks [6]. Making

use of the Chapman-Enskog expansion, Mohanty and Baral derived relativistic transport

coeﬃcients including magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects [7].

Rapid heating of plasma often leads to a bi-Maxwellian electron distribution, consisting of

a bulk and high-energy tail, while maintaining relatively cold ions. In fact, the appearances

of two-temperature spectrum for electrons have been observed in some experiments with

high-intensity lasers [8]. The well-pronounced tail and its velocity moment, which determine

the transport properties, are in the relativistic temperature regime and, therefore, important

to the fundamental study of relativistic electron transport.

In this Brief Communication, the relativistic transport theory presented in the previous

paper [9] is expanded, aiming at the numerical simulation of high-temperature ignition

plasmas, and celestial plasmas. We focus on a problem relevant to heat ﬂux inhibition

due to relativistic eﬀects of electrons within the framework of the relativistically corrected

Spitzer-H¨arm (SH) formula for electron-two-temperature plasmas with density gradients.

The formula is fully consistent with the current-neutral condition, so that one can readily

couple the transport coeﬃcients with ﬂuid codes [10].

The relativistic thermal conductivity is derived below, along the manner developed by BK

[4, 5]. Begin with the Legendre expansion for electron distribution function, viz., f (r, p, t) ≃

f0(r, p, t) + (p/p) · f1(r, p, t) + higher order terms for the small parameter which is related

to a characteristic ﬁeld strength [9]. Introducing the relation of px = pcosφ, a relativistically

extended kinetic equation is averaged over the solid angle Ω, i.e., < · · · >=

· · · d(Ω/4π).

After the manipulations, we obtain the ﬁrst order equation in the form of

electron rest mass, the averaged charge number, and the Coulomb logarithm, respectively

[9].

In Eq. (1), the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁelds are ignored. This approximation is valid for

νei ≫ ωc, where ωc = |eB|/(Γm0) is the electron cyclotron frequency. The validity condition

gives the allowable parameter range of the magnetic ﬁeld strength of

In highly compressed targets irradiating by a relativistic laser pulse [11], the dense plasma
parameters are typically (Γ − 1) ∼ 10−1, ni ∼ 1026 cm−3, ¯Z ≈ 3.5 (carbonized deuterium-

tritium), and lnΛ ≈ 5. For such parameters, the right-hand side (RHS) of Eq. (2) reads

about 130 MG. Around the tenuous coronae, the laser pulse drives relativistic currents, and

induces the self-magnetic ﬁelds of magnitude B ∼ m0ωpec/e ∼ 102 MG. Recent numerical

simulation indicates that at the surface, an intense magnetic ﬁeld of B ≤ 280 MG prevents

hot electrons from penetrating into the higher density region [12]. The electrons near the

channel envelope where the magnetic ﬁeld is strongest, as well as lower energy electrons,

tend to be magnetically trapped [13], since their Larmor radii are comparable to or even

less than the channel radius. This stopping eﬀect seems to be subject to the Alfv´en current

limit [14], which is irrelevant to the limit of energy ﬂux. For a self-focusing electron beam,

a fraction of energetic electrons, running along the channel axis, cannot be trapped [13],

and generate the relatively small magnetic ﬁelds of B < 102 MG in the denser plasma, as

was shown in Ref. [12]. The penetrating electrons have a largely anisotropic momentum

distribution, which cannot be treated by the diﬀusion approximation employed here. In a

highly compressed region, however, the transported electrons are expected to be thermalized

via dissipative processes [14, 15], and the beam type transport may become diﬀusive, further

decaying the magnetic ﬁelds. Although, diﬀusive transport plays a signiﬁcant role in heating

the ﬁnal compressed fuel, the details are still not well understood. Hence, here we investigate

the fundamental transport properties in the parameter regions of the highly compressed

ignitor plasma, where magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects can be fairly neglected, as far as Eq. (2) is

fulﬁlled. I also mention that the density gradient of ablative plasma is likely to be steep in

In this sense,

local transport

theory is valid only for the case of λ ≪ |LT |, where LT = T /(∂T /∂x) is the charac-

teristic length of the temperature gradient. Concerning the relation of |∂T /∂x| ∼ e|Ex|

derived from Eq. (5), the parameter range involving the electric ﬁeld can be estimated as
|Ex| ≪ Ec ∼ 1012(100 keV/T )( ¯Z 2ni/1027 cm−3)(lnΛ/10) V/m. In the case of ignitor physics,

the relativistic electron transport establishes the temperature gradient in the high-density

plasma. Assuming the spatial gradient of ∆T /∆x ∼ −100 keV/100 µm, the electric ﬁeld

strength can be estimated as |Ex| ∼ 109 V/m [see also Eq. (11) below]. For T ≤ 102 keV,

4

¯Z 2ni ∼ 1027 cm−3, and lnΛ ≈ 5, we read |Ex| < 10−2Ec. For the case of |Ex| > (0.01−0.1)Ec,

one may solve kinetic transport equations to determine the full self-consistent spectral dis-

tribution, instead of using Eq. (6) [16].

Substituting Eq. (6) into Eqs. (4) and (5), we obtain the relativistic heat ﬂux of

qx ≡ −κrel(∂Th/∂x) for the temperature gradient of hot electrons, and may decompose
the coeﬃcient as κrel = frelκSH. Here, κSH(Th) = 256(2π)1/2ǫ2

and isobaric (ne,jTj = const), respectively.

The geometrical constraint of ∇ne,j k ∇Tj due to ignoring two-dimensional (2D) eﬀects

means that thermoelectric magnetic ﬁelds, which can be prominent, for example, in intense

laser-plasma interactions [18], are not taken into account at the moment. 2D eﬀects are

important, because they prefer to short out electric ﬁelds and pinch directional ﬂows by

the toroidal magnetic ﬁelds. The complexities of magnetic inhibition in heat ﬂux might be

eﬀectively considered by introducing a reduction factor fB < 1: Bohm’s fB = (1 + ωcτ )−1
c τ 2)−1 [18], where τ denotes a collision period. That is, one
or Braginskii’s fB = (1 + ω2
can practically utilize the cross-ﬁeld conductivity approximated by κ⊥rel ≈ fBfrelκSH. Note

that Eq. (2) reﬂects the much smaller Hall parameter ωcτ ≪ 1, such that fB → 1, and

κ⊥rel ≃ κkrel = κrel.

In the following, more elemental issues are investigated, i.e., relativistically extended lon-

gitudinal thermoelectric eﬀects. With regard to the longitudinal thermal diﬀusion that devel-

ops an electrostatic potential, one should note the important relation ǫ = LTh[eEx/(m0c2)].
For the special case of ne,h/ne → 1, C2,c → 0, and θ → 1, namely, the one-temperature

model for electrons, the self-consistent electric ﬁeld Eq. (8) reduces to

ǫ ≃

Θ2(α)

(cid:20)

+ C3(α, δ)

,

(cid:21)

(11)

where α ≡ αj and C3 ≡ C3,j. In the thermoelectric point of view, the relativistic Seebeck

coeﬃcient can be deﬁned by s ≡ αǫ/e. The temperature dependence of Eq. (11) is shown

in Table I for δ ≡ δj = 0 and −1. In the nonrelativistic limit of α ≫ 1, Eq. (11) for δ = 0

asymptotically approaches ǫ → −5/(2α) [9]. In the isobaric case of δ = −1, owing to the

pressure-balance eﬀects, the ﬁeld strength reduces to 50 − 60 % of the δ = 0 case. Noted is

that in this case the ﬂux limiter frel does not depend on δ, and the similar property appears

again in the following other cases.

In Fig. 1, the temperature dependence of the relativistically corrected ﬂux limiter are

shown. The ratios of hot/total electron density are chosen for ne,h/ne = 0.1 − 1, ﬁxing

the temperature scale length equal, θ = 1. For the electron-two-temperature models of

ne,h/ne 6= 1 (C2,c 6= 0), set the temperature of cold component to αc = 102 (Tc = 5.11 keV)

as an example. The densities are set to be uniform (δj = 0), except for the case of ne,h/ne =

0.1 that the nonuniformity (δj = −1) is taken into consideration. Actually our major

interests are in the relativistic heat ﬂux carried by the high-energy tail electrons of Γ >

Γ0 = (αh − αc)−1ln(C2,c/C2,h), where the spectral population of hot electrons is larger than

6

that of cold ones. As expected, in the lower energy regions of Γ < Γ0, energy transport by

cold components is dominant. In Fig. 1, such criterion seems to appear as pseudo cut-oﬀ in

the lower temperature region.

Now one ﬁnds that the heat ﬂux is strongly inhibited in the relativistic regime. For

example, in the one-temperature model for electrons, the ﬂux limiters are frel ≃ 0.73 for
T = 0.1m0c2 (α = 10) and frel ≃ 0.37 for T = m0c2 (α = 1), as shown in Fig. 1 (solid

curve). This is due to the drift velocity carrying heat asymptotically close to the speed

of light. Moreover, it is found that a fall in the hot electron population leads to further

decrease of the conductivity, and indeed, the degree of the depletion reﬂects the abundance

of hot electrons. Regarding the electron transport in laser-produced plasmas, typically a

ﬂux limiter of order of 10−2 − 10−1 has been empirically employed [16], consistent with

the experimental results [19]. In this aspect, the present results imply that the relativistic

eﬀects on sparsely populated high-energy tails can also participate in lowering the ﬂux limit.

These properties do not largely depend on δj as seen in Fig. 1. For example, in the case of

ne,h/ne = 0.1, the diﬀerence of the ﬂux limiter between the case of δj = 0 (dotted curve)

and −1 (crosses) is about 10% at most.

Taking the limit of nh,e/ne → 1, C2,c → 0, and θ → 1, Eqs. (7)-(10) reduce to

This corresponds to the standard relativistic SH heat conductivity having the temperature

dependence of κHM(T ) = frel(T )κSH(T ) ∝ T 2 − T 5/2 [9], which exhibits the asymptotic
property of κSH(T ) ∝ T 5/2 (frel → 1) in the nonrelativistic limit of α ≫ 1 [17], whereas
κDT(T ) = [5(2π)1/2/32]α1/2κSH(T ) ∝ T 2 (frel ∝ T −1/2) by Dzhavakhishvili and Tsintsadze

in the ultrarelativistic limit of α ≪ 1 [20]. These characteristics are also shown in Fig. 1

(solid curve), and summarized in Table I.

Here let us take the ratio of the thermal to electrical conductivity. The key relation

is known as the Wiedemann-Franz law for metallic states of matters [21]. The ubiquitous

nature is derived from a simple assumption of the elastic scattering of conduction electrons.

As for fully ionized plasmas, the relativistically extended law can be expressed as

lnΛ) stands for the nonrelativistic Spitzer conductiv-

ity. Evidently, the ratio depends on the temperature only, without involving the intrinsic

parameters of plasmas. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of Eq. (13).

In the

nonrelativistic limit of α ≫ 1, it asymptotically approaches κHM/σBK → κSH/σS = 4T /e2

[17]. This value slightly decreases as the temperature increases, to take the minimum value

of (κHM/σBK)min = 3.92T /e2 at α = 19.6 (T = 26.1 keV). As seen in the ﬁgure, it increases
up to κDT/σBK = 5T /e2 in the ultrarelativistic regime.

It may be instructive to men-

tion that the transport equation of the Fermi liquid in metals or condensed plasmas yields

κ/σ ≃ π2T /(3e2) ≃ 3.3T /e2 [21, 22], which is lower than (κHM/σBK)min in the ordinary

plasmas.

The heat conductivity holds the larger power index of temperature. Thus, fast heating

of plasma can drive the nonlinear heat-wave accompanied with a well-deﬁned wave front,

where an electrostatic ﬁeld tends to be well developed. This leads to an idea that such a

thermally non-equilibrated plasma can be essentially compared to a thermoelectric converter.

And, in general, its eﬃciency can be quantitatively evaluated by invoking a thermoelectric

ﬁgure of merit. Along the conventional notation used in material physics, we now deﬁne

the thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit by Z ≡ s2σBK/κHM = (αǫ/e)2(σBK/κHM) for ne,h/ne = 1.

Making use of Eqs. (11) and (13), this multiplied by T can be written in the dimensionless

form,

ZT = −

[Θ1(α) + Θ2(α)C3(α, δ)]2

(14)

Note that Eq. (14) depends on δ, in contrast to Eqs. (12) and (13). For δ = 0 and −1,

the temperature dependence of Eq. (14) and the coeﬃcient s are also shown in Fig. 2.

It is found that for α ≫ 1, Eq. (14) asymptotically approaches ZT (δ = 0) → 25

16 and
5 . Particularly,
in the nonrelativistic plasmas with uniform density, i.e., α ≫ 1 and δ = 0, one can extract

16 , whereas for α ≪ 1, ZT (δ = 0) → 4

5 and ZT (δ = −1) → 1

ZT (δ = −1) → 9

the higher ﬁgure of merit ZT = 1.56, compared with the typical thermoelectric materials

which provide ZT ≃ 0.4−1.3 as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 2 [23]. Notice that the Carnot

eﬃciency can be achieved for ZT ≫ 1. The dimensionless values of (κHM/σBK)(e2/T ), (se)2,

and ZT for some α and δ values are summarized in Table II.

In conclusion, I have derived solutions for the heat conductivity and related thermoelectric

coeﬃcients in a relativistic nonuniform plasma. These results indicate that the relativistic

8

eﬀects on the high-energy tail electrons signiﬁcantly limit the heat ﬂux. This mechanism

might play an additional role of the stopping of relativistic electrons in the context of ignitor

physics [15], although this work ignores 2D thermoelectric eﬀects such as ∇⊥n × ∇kT , which

may be important for typical ignitor geometries.

, only for ne,h/ne = 0.1

j

and Tc/m0c2 = 0.01 (crosses).

FIG. 2: Electron temperature dependence of the dimensionless thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit ZT

(solid curves), the Wiedemann-Franz ratio κHM/σBK multiplied by e2/T (dotted-dashed curve),

and the Seebeck coeﬃcient s multiplied by |e| (dotted curves). Note that in the present case

κHM/σBK is independent on δ and takes the minimum values at T /m0c2 ≃ 0.051.

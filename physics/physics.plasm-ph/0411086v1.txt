Abstract

Recent advances in the integrated modeling of ELMy H-mode plasmas are presented. A model for the
H-mode pedestal and for the triggering of ELMs predicts the height, width, and shape of the H-mode
pedestal and the frequency and width of ELMs. Formation of the pedestal and the L-H transition is the
direct result of ~Er × ~B ﬂow shear suppression of anomalous transport. The periodic ELM crashes are
triggered by either the ballooning or peeling MHD instabilities. The BALOO, DCON, and ELITE ideal
MHD stability codes are used to derive a new parametric expression for the peeling-ballooning threshold.
The new dependence for the peeling-ballooning threshold is implemented in the ASTRA transport code.
Results of integrated modeling of DIII-D like discharges are presented and compared with experimental
observations. The results from the ideal MHD stability codes are compared with results from the resistive
MHD stability code NIMROD.

Introduction

Transport modeling of the edge of tokamak plasmas is a challenging problem, because a wide
range of time and length scales need to be considered and many different elements of physics
are involved at the plasma edge. The physics topics that are critically important for the plasma
edge are the transition from low- to high- conﬁnement regime (L-H transition), H-mode pedestal
build up, anomalous and neoclassical transport at the plasma edge, role of the ~Er × ~B ﬂow shear,
triggering and dynamics of the edge localized modes (ELMs). One of the effective ways to test
ideas for physics models is to combine them within an integrative modeling code and compare the
simulation results with the experiments. Integrated modeling studies that self-consistently take into
account the effects of the plasma edge have been developing recently [1, 2, 3]. In particular, a new

model for the H-mode pedestal and ELMs has been recently developed by Pankin et al [3]. The
model predicts the height, width, and shape of the H-mode pedestal as well as the frequency and
width of ELMs. The model for the H-mode pedestal in tokamak plasmas is based on ﬂow shear
reduction of anomalous transport. The formation of the pedestal and the L-H transition in this
model are the direct result of ~Er × ~B ﬂow shear suppression of transport. ELMs can be triggered
either by ballooning or by peeling modes. The model for the pedestal and ELMs has been used in
a predictive integrated modeling code to follow the time evolution of tokamak discharges from L-
mode through the transition from L-mode to H-mode, with the formation of the H-mode pedestal,
and, subsequently, the triggering of ELMs. The model for the H-mode pedestal and ELMs [3] is
advanced in this paper. The ELM triggering conditions are studied with the MHD stability codes
BALOO [4], DCON [5], and ELITE [6]. These MHD instability codes are used to compute the
combined peeling-ballooning threshold, which are then used to derive ﬁtting expressions that are
included in the model. Using these MHD instability enhances the model and extends the level of
its applicability. The improved stability criterion model is tested in the integrated modeling code
ASTRA. Cases with low and high triangularities are considered.

Peeling-ballooning stability analysis

Plasmas with high triangularity, δ = 0.6, and low triangularity, δ = 0.2, are considered. Other
plasma parameters are held ﬁxed in the reference cases: the minor radius a = 0.63 m; major ra-
dius R = 1.69 m; toroidal magnetic ﬁeld BT = 2.0 T; plasma current I = 1.54 MA; elongation
κ = 1.78; central plasma density ne(0) = 4.7×1019 m−3; and central ion end electron temperatures
Te,i = 4 kEV. The TOQ equilibrium code [4] is used to generate a set of equilibria that covers the
range of transport simulations for the plasma parameters given above. As long as the plasma geom-
etry, toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, and total plasma current are ﬁxed in the transport simulations, ELMs
are controlled by only the pressure gradient and bootstrap current. The shape of the electron density
proﬁle is kept unchanged in all scans; the electron density at the top of the pedestal is set to satisfy
the dependence nped = 0.71 hnei, which is observed in experiments. In the density scan, the entire
density proﬁle is scaled and in the temperature scan, the central temperature is kept ﬁxed, while the
pedestal temperature is changed. Both the bootstrap current and pressure gradient are changed in
the density and temperature scans. The density scan provides more control of the bootstrap current,
while the temperature scan provides more control of the normalized pressure gradient, α, which is
deﬁned in this study as α = − (µ0/2π2) (∂p/∂ψ) (∂V /∂ψ) (V /2π2R)1/2, where V is the plasma
volume and ψ is the poloidal ﬂux. These equilibria are used in the BALOO, DCON, and ELITE
codes to validate the peeling-ballooning stability criteria in the limits of different toroidal mode
numbers. The BALOO code [4] is an inﬁnite mode number ballooning stability code developed
at General Atomics. The ideal MHD DCON code [5] is suitable for the stability analysis of low
toroidal number ballooning and peeling modes, and the ELITE code [6] works well for the analysis
of intermediate and high mode numbers. Since these codes are complementary, they can be used
together to compute the stability criteria.

The results of the stability analysis are shown in Fig. 1. The high triangularity discharge has a
larger stable region than the low triangularity discharge, which is consistent with experimental
results and other MHD stability analysis [7]. In particular, the higher triangularity discharges have a
larger second stability region, which is also consistent with the conclusion that higher triangularity
discharges can more easily access the second ballooning stability region of parameter space [8].

The peeling-ballooning threshold shown in Fig. 1 is parameterized using ﬁfth order polynomials,
which are implemented in the ASTRA transport code and used as the criteria to trigger ELM
crashes in the transport simulations.

Results of integrated transport simulations

A reference scenario for ASTRA simulations is based on typical DIII-D geometry, using the pa-
rameters given at the beginning of previous Section. In addition, the electron, ion, and impurity
density proﬁles, toroidal rotation velocity, Zeﬀ, the current density driven by the neutral beam
injection (NBI) heating, and the auxiliary heating power deposited to electrons and ions, which
are obtained from an analysis simulation of experimental data, are prescribed and ﬁxed in form.
For both the lower and higher triangularity discharges, the auxiliary heating power is varied from
3.5 MW to 7.0 MW in a series of simulations. The ELM frequencies as a function of auxiliary
heating power for discharges with higher and lower triangularities are shown in Fig. 2. It can be
seen that the ELM frequency increases with the heating power in the simulations, which is consis-
tent with experimental observations in H-mode plasmas with type I ELMs. The change of the slope
of the ELM frequency as a function of heating power, shown in Fig. 2, can be explained by the
different scenarios that are followed for low and high auxiliary heating discharges. In the ASTRA
simulations, the discharges with low auxiliary heating (below 7 MW) have ELM crashes that are
triggered by a ballooning instability in the second stability limit, while the discharges with high
heating power (above 7 MW) are triggered by a ballooning instability in the ﬁrst stability limit.

Summary

An improved model is introduced for H-mode pedestal and ELMs [3]. A parameterized peeling-
ballooning stability criterion is implemented in the model, based on detailed MHD analyses with
the BALOO, DCON, and ELITE codes. Two different scenarios for ELM crashes in DIII-D dis-
charges are shown. For the scenario with lower auxiliary heating power, ELMs are mostly caused
by the ballooning instability in the second stability limit. For the scenario with higher auxiliary
heating power (above 7 MW), ELMs might be caused by the ballooning instability in the ﬁrst sta-

bility limit. Such ELM crashes are much less violent and more frequent. In general, the frequency
of ELMs increases with the auxiliary heating power (as shown in Fig. 2), which is consistent with
the experimental observations. The frequency of ELMs also depends on the plasma shaping. In
particular, the dependence on the triangularity is studied in this paper. It is found that higher tri-
angularity discharges have a larger stability region than lower triangularity discharges (compare
Figs. 1 (a) and (b)). This observation is consistent with other MHD stability analysis [7, 8]. As
result, ELMs in lower triangularity discharges are much more frequent than ELMs in higher trian-
gularity discharges (as shown in Fig. 2).

In conclusion, it is clear that additional MHD stability studies are required. In this paper, ideal
MHD stability codes are used, while resistivity and two-ﬂuid effects are expected to be important.
A preliminary study with the resistive MHD NIMROD [9] code is under way. In order to verify the
results obtained with the MHD ideal stability code, a robust vacuum code should be used together
with the NIMROD code which will be done in future studies.

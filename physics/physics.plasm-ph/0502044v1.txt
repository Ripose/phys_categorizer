Phase distortion mechanisms in
linear beam vacuum devices

John G. W¨ohlbier

January 7, 2014

Abstract

The mechanism for phase distortion in linear beam vacuum devices
is identiﬁed in the simplest system that pertains to such devices, the
force-free drifting electron beam. We show that the dominant cause of
phase distortion in a force-free drifting beam is the inverse dependence
of arrival time on velocity for an electron, i.e., the “1/u nonlinearity,”
and that a secondary cause of phase distortion is the nonlinearity of the
velocity modulation. We claim that this is the mechanism for phase dis-
tortion in all linear beam vacuum devices, and provide evidence from a
traveling wave tube calculation. Finally, we discuss the force-free drifting
beam example in the context of the “self-intermodulation” description of
phase distortion recently described in Refs. [J. W¨ohlbier and J. Booske,
Phys. Rev. E, vol. 69, 2004, 066502], [J. W¨ohlbier and J. Booske, IEEE
Trans. Elec. Devices, To appear.]

We recently reported on mechanisms for phase distortion in linear beam vac-
uum devices [3, 4]. The mechanism for phase distortion was reported there as
a “self-intermodulation” process, where harmonic beam distortions interacted
with the fundamental beam modulation to produce a phase shift at the funda-
mental. While this frequency domain view of phase distortion is a useful one,
we felt that a corresponding time domain view of phase distortion would be a
useful contribution to the overall understanding of phase distortion. In this note
we consider the simplest possible system that pertains to linear beam electron
devices, a space charge free (“force-free”) drifting electron beam. Indeed the
physical mechanism for phase distortion exists in the force-free drifting beam,
and hence the system provides the most lucid example in which to study phase
distortion.

A 1-d force-free drifting beam is described by Burger’s equation for the beam

velocity u,

ut + uux = 0,

(1)

where x is space, t is time, and the subscripts indicate partial derivatives. To
apply Eq. (1) to a klystron where the space charge force is negligible, for exam-
ple, one sets the boundary value of u as the sum of a dc beam velocity u0 and

1

a sinusoidal perturbation due to the cavity modulation. Assuming that the dc
velocity is normalized to 1, this is written

Given the solution to Eq. (1) with boundary condition (2), the beam density
evolution is obtained by solving the continuity equation

u(0, t) = 1 + ǫ sin ωt.

ρt + (ρu)x = 0

for an appropriate density boundary condition.

The force-free Burger’s equation (1) implies that the velocity of an electron
(ﬂuid element) does not change, i.e., the (x, t) trajectories, or characteristics,
of Eq. (1) are straight lines with slopes determined by the boundary data. In
vacuum electronics the density bunching that results from the sinusoidal velocity
modulation is called “ballistic bunching.” Initially we will consider inputs for
which there is no electron overtaking, and inputs such that electron overtaking
occurs will be considered later.

In principle the force-free drifting electron beam can be solved exactly prior
to electron overtaking, although closed form analytic solutions need to be writ-
ten in terms of inﬁnite series [1]. Equation (1) is solved using the method of
characteristics. The method of characteristics involves changing the equations to
Lagrangian independent coordinates (material coordinates), solving the equa-
tions in Lagrangian coordinates, and changing the solution back to Eulerian
coordinates. For a ﬂuid element that crosses x = 0 at time t0 we write the
transformation from Lagrangian to Eulerian coordinates as the time function
t(x, t0), i.e., the time ﬂuid element t0 arrives at x, with t(0, t0) = t0. Since the
velocity is a constant for each ﬂuid element, the velocity solution in Lagrangian
coordinates is

u(x, t0) = 1 + ǫ sin ωt0.

That is, independent of location x, the velocity of an electron is set by the
time t0 at which it crosses x = 0. Since the electron orbits are straight line
trajectories in (x, t) space, we can infer the solution for the function t(x, t0)

.

To solve for u(x, t) one needs to invert the function t(x, t0), i.e., calculate t0(x, t),
and substitute it into Eq. (4). Since we restrict, for now, our attention to
input levels such that no electron overtaking occurs, i.e., the characteristics
do not cross, Eq. (6) can be inverted. Unfortunately t(x, t0) in Eq. (6) is a
transcendental function of t0, so an analytic inverse needs to be expressed in
terms of an inﬁnite series.

For phase distortion we are ultimately interested in the beam current and
beam density, since they linearly drive circuit or cavity ﬁelds. The continuity
equation in Lagrangian coordinates is given by [1, 5]

ρ(x, t0) =

ρ(0, t0)u(0, t0)

where the last equality comes from the fact that u(0, t0) = u(x, t0) since we
are considering a force-free drifting beam. For the density solution in Eulerian
coordinates one composes the density in Lagrangian coordinates (8) with the
mapping from Eulerian to Lagrangian coordinates t0(x, t).

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

The factor ∂t/∂t0 is the Jacobian of the transformation from Lagrangian to
Eulerian coordinates, and it quantiﬁes the amount of stretching or compressing
in time the electron beam undergoes. That is, for a ﬂuid element entering the
system of time length δt0, it will occupy a time length of δt = (∂t(x, t0)/∂t0)δt0
downstream at position x. For purposes of explaining phase distortion it will
be convenient to write the Jacobian in terms of derivatives with respect to both
t0 and u, i.e.,1

In Fig. 1 we show density solutions versus time, where a root ﬁnder was used
to invert Eq. (6). The results are for the velocity modulation (2) with ω = 2π
and a uniform density boundary condition ρ(0, t0) = 1. To accentuate the eﬀect
of phase distortion we use a strong velocity modulation, ǫ = 0.389, and observe
the output at x = 0.3. There is no electron overtaking at x if the Jacobian stays
greater than zero, i.e., when

for all t0. In the present case the maximum value of the left hand side of Eq. (10)
is equal to 0.9992 with x = 0.3. The linear velocity and density solutions are
solutions to the (normalized) linear equations

ut + ux = 0

(11)

ρt + ρx + ux = 0

(12)
1We use the function ˆt(x, t0, u), cf. Eq. (5), to formally diﬀerentiate from the function
t(x, t0), cf. Eq. (6), so that the left hand side of Eq. (9) and the ﬁrst term on the right hand
side of Eq. (9) are not considered equal. We did not use the hat (ˆ) notation in Eqs. (5) and
(6) where there was no chance of confusion, and we will drop the notation for the remainder
of the paper.

In Fig. 1 the nonlinear density solution, the linear density solution, and the
fundamental component of the nonlinear density solution obtained by using a
fast Fourier transform are shown. The phase shift between the linear density
solution and the fundamental component of the nonlinear density solution is the
“phase distortion” of the nonlinear solution. It is clear from the ﬁgure that the
reason for the phase shift of the fundamental component of the nonlinear density
solution from the linear solution is because the density is larger “on average”
behind (in time) the density peak (early times are to the left). Therefore, to
explain phase distortion one must explain the reason for the asymmetry in the
density about the density peak. (Also note that for this value of ǫ the nonlinear
solution shown in Fig. 1 shows “amplitude distortion” in that the fundamental
component of the density is smaller than the predicted linear density amplitude.)
The reason for the the higher density behind the peak comes predominantly
from the “1/u nonlinearity” in the arrival time function (5), and secondarily
from the nonlinearity of the ǫ sin ωt0 velocity modulation. It is intuitive that
about a larger initial velocity u, a given deviation ±δu will result in a smaller
∓δt at x than the same ±δu would have on ∓δt for a smaller initial velocity u
[a ﬂuid element with velocity u ± δu arrives earlier (later), at time t ∓ δt, than
a ﬂuid element with velocity u which arrives at t]. This intuition is of course
borne out by the derivative

evaluated at large and small values of velocity u. This dependence causes phase
distortion in that relatively slower ﬂuid elements stretch and compress diﬀerently
than the relatively faster ﬂuid elements. That is, the size of density ﬂuctuations
at a ﬂuid element depends on its initial velocity, with smaller initial velocities
having larger ﬂuctuations. This eﬀect is best demonstrated with an example
where more speciﬁc points regarding the interplay of the 1/u nonlinearity and
the nonlinearity of the velocity modulation may be emphasized.

In Fig. 2 we show the velocity modulation, the Jacobian, and the density
versus ﬂuid element t0 at x = 0.3. Note that since u(x, t0) = u(0, t0) the

Results show slightly more than one period in t0.

velocity versus ﬂuid element label t0 is also the initial velocity modulation at
x = 0 versus ﬂuid element label t0. In the region B–D the beam is bunched
because ﬂuid elements entering at any time are given a faster initial velocity
than the ﬂuid elements entering just prior to them, where again we assume
for the time being that modulations are not strong enough to cause electron
overtaking. It is instructive to look at the expression for the Jacobian,

and determine, for example, the ﬂuid element at which the density will be
maximum. The Jacobian is inversely proportional to density, and hence the
maximum density occurs the minimum Jacobian; for a given δt0 the minimum
δt corresponds to the maximum ﬂuid compression. Consider the two derivatives
on the right hand side of Eq. (16). As described above, due to the inverse
dependence of t on u, for a given δu ﬂuid elements with relatively larger initial
velocities in B–D will be compressed less than ﬂuid elements with relatively

smaller initial velocities. That is, ∂t/∂u is largest negative at B and smallest
negative at D. Furthermore, for the sinusoidal velocity modulation the change in
velocity for a given δt0, ∂u/∂t0, is zero at point B and increases to a maximum
at point C. The minimum Jacobian will occur at a ﬂuid element between points
B and C such that (∂t/∂u)(∂u/∂t0) is the largest negative. The value of t0 for
which this happens can be computed by setting the derivative of the Jacobian
with respect to t0 to zero, and solving for t0. For the linear solution point C is
the ﬂuid element around which the density is maximum.

The density asymmetry about the peak also comes from the 1/u nonlinearity.
Since the compression is enhanced in B–C relative to C–D, region B–C becomes
smaller than C–D, as seen in Fig. 3. The results in Fig. 3 are the solutions in
Eulerian coordinates which are obtained by composing the Lagrangian solutions
in Fig. 2 with the map t0(x, t), i.e., the mapping that determines which ﬂuid

element t0 arrives at a given (x, t), shown in Fig. 4.

density ﬂuid element lies nearly half way between points B and C at the input
(see Fig. 22) it is very near to point C by x = 0.3, the point about which
the linear density is maximum, as seen in Fig. 3. Because B–C is much more
compressed than C–D, loosely speaking, the regions that neighbor the region of
maximum density are a stretched region A–B earlier in time and the compressed
region C–D along with the stretched region D–A (periodic waveform) later in
time. Furthermore, the stretched region A–B has enhanced stretching over
region D–A, contributing to the higher density behind (in time) the peak.

In sum, the above describes how phase distortion of a force-free drifting beam
is a manifestation primarily of the inverse dependence of the arrival time t(x, t0)
2Since the velocity of a ﬂuid element does not change in the force-free drifting beam
u(x, t0) = u(0, t0). Hence u(x, t0) in Fig. 2 can be used to determine the phase position of
ﬂuid element t0 with respect to the velocity modulation at x = 0, even though the ﬁgure
caption indicates that the quantities are evaluated at x = 0.3.

on velocity u, but also depends on the nonlinearity of the velocity modulation.
To prove that the “dominant” cause for phase distortion is the 1/u nonlinearity
we do the following calculation. First, for a small velocity modulation (ǫ small)
we can linearize the 1/u nonlinearity to get

t(x, t0) ≈ t0 + x(1 − ǫ sin ωt0),

∂t
∂t0

≈ 1 − xǫω cos ωt0.

(17)

(18)

For this arrival time function the location of maximum density (minimum Jaco-
bian) is the same as for the linear solution, point C in Fig. 3. However, with this
approximation the problem does not immediately reduce to the linear solution
since the characteristics do not all have the same slope.3 In this limit there is no
phase distortion since Eq. (18) is an even function about the Jacobian minimum,
and hence the density is an even function about the density peak. Furthermore,
we could replace the modulation by any periodic function that is odd in t0 (plus
or minus an arbitrary time shift) for a period and get the same result. Thus,
by linearizing the 1/u nonlinearity and not linearizing the velocity modulation
the phase distortion is removed. This conﬁrms that the 1/u nonlinearity is the
dominant cause of phase distortion.4

Up to now we have restricted the input to a level such that electron trajecto-
ries do not cross. The reason for such a restriction was to ensure that the phase
distortion physics was not potentially clouded by electron overtaking physics.
3To get to the solution of the linear problem one can substitute Eq. (18) into Eq. (8), use
that ǫ is small to move the denominator to the numerator with a sign change on the cosine
term, and use t0 = t − x which can be obtained by taking ǫ = 0 in Eq. (17).

4One might be tempted to linearize the modulation without linearizing the 1/u nonlinearity
for a complementary view. However, it is not possible to linearize the modulation and maintain
its periodicity since a periodic function is nonlinear in its argument.

7

In fact, no such restriction was necessary, and the principle of phase distortion
is the same even when the input is set such that electron trajectories cross. In
Fig. 5 we show the beam velocity, nonlinear beam density, linear beam density,

and the fundamental component of the nonlinear beam density for an input
of ǫ = 0.6. The velocity solution and the two peaked structure of the density
conﬁrm the multi-valued nature of the solutions. From the ﬂuid element labels
we see that region B–D is in the multi-phase region of the density, and that
the higher density behind the peak is again because region D–A (or region B–A
outside the multi-phase zone) is not stretched to the extent that region A–B (or
region A–C outside the multi-phase zone) is.

Even though the preceding analysis considered only a force-free drifting
beam, we claim that phase distortion mechanism identiﬁed holds more gen-
erally for klystrons when space charge forces are considered, and in traveling
wave tubes (TWTs). The reason is again the inverse dependence of arrival time
on velocity. That is, electrons slowed down from the dc beam velocity will have
enhanced stretching or compression over those that are sped up from the dc
beam velocity. Although we do not provide an exhaustive analysis, for illus-
tration we consider the electron beam density versus time from a Lagrangian
TWT model [6] in Fig. 6. Even though electrons experience forces due to space
charge and circuit ﬁelds in a TWT, as can be inferred by comparing the beam
velocities of Figs. 5 and 6, the cause of phase distortion is the same. Electrons
slowed down from the dc beam velocity will spread more in time than electrons
sped up from the dc beam velocity. The result is that the density wave form
has a relatively higher density behind the peak than in front of it, as seen in
Fig. 6.

In Refs. [3, 4] we described phase distortion from a frequency domain per-
spective as a “self-intermodulation” process, whereby harmonic distortions mix

with the fundamental to produce distortions at the fundamental. Below we
outline this view of phase distortion so that it may be compared to the time
domain view given above.

If we express the velocity u and density ρ with Fourier series (for periodic
inputs), then the fundamental frequency components of nonlinear products of
ρ and u are seen to come from mixing of the second harmonic with the funda-
mental frequency, and mixing of higher order harmonics. In particular, if we
deﬁne state variable envelopes as in Refs. [3, 4], e.g.,

u(x, t) =

where the approximations used in Refs. [3, 4] have been made. From Eq. (20)
products of frequencies such as (m, n) = (−1, 2), (2, −1), (−2, 3), (3, −2), etc. are
seen to inﬂuence the fundamental frequency ℓ = 1. In Refs. [3, 4] we considered
(m, n) = (−1, 2), (2, −1) (third order intermodulation, “3 IM”) and (m, n) =
(−2, 3), (3, −2) (5 IM) contributions to phase distortion in linear beam devices.
Equation (20) together with the corresponding nonlinear envelope equation
for the velocity has an analytic solution that may be expressed in an inﬁnite

series of complex exponentials. The ﬁrst terms in the series correspond to the
linear solution as seen in Fig. 1. The linear terms are used in the equation for
the second harmonic envelopes to produce the ﬁrst terms in the series solution
at the second harmonic. The second harmonic terms are then combined with
the linear terms from the fundamental solution to produce the next set of terms
at the fundamental. These complex exponentials add to the linear density solu-
tion and produce a phase shift (distortion) in the density solution. As it turns
out, this process of generating harmonics and then additional terms at the fun-
damental must be continued to get an accurate representation of the nonlinear
phase shifted density seen in Fig. 1. For the example in Fig. 1 we found that
terms higher than 11 IM were required to adequately approximate the nonlinear
density, whereas in Refs. [3,4] we found that 5 IMs were suﬃcient to predict the
phase distortion. The diﬀerence between the two cases is that the case in Fig. 1
has a much larger relative input modulation.

We have identiﬁed the mechanism for phase distortion in the simplest sys-
tem that pertains to linear beam vacuum devices, the force-free drifting electron
beam. The dominant cause of phase distortion is shown to be the inverse depen-
dence of arrival time for an electron on its velocity, i.e., the “1/u nonlinearity,”
and that a secondary cause of phase distortion is the nonlinearity of the veloc-
ity modulation. Although we show this to be the case for the force-free drifting
beam, we claim that the 1/u nonlinearity is also the cause of phase distortion in
other linear beam devices, such as the traveling wave tube. That is, even though
electrons are experiencing forces from the circuit and space charge ﬁelds, the fact
remains that charges slowed down from the dc beam velocity will stretch and
compress more than charges sped up from the dc beam velocity. Results from
a traveling wave tube calculation are given that show the same characteristic
asymmetric density modulation that is seen in the force-free drifting beam. We
also show that the 1/u nonlinearity is the cause of phase distortion regardless
of whether drive levels are strong enough such that electron overtaking occurs.
The identiﬁcation of the mechanism for phase distortion suggests how inputs
might be tailored to ameliorate phase distortion. The obvious candidates would
involve somehow reducing the amplitude of the velocity modulation on the neg-
ative half cycle to lessen the eﬀect of the “enhanced stretching,” or to provide
a density modulation 180◦ out of phase from the velocity modulation so that
the “enhanced stretching” before the peak starts from a higher density value
relative to the density behind the peak, and would be balanced about the den-
sity peak at the output. The latter scheme may be facilitated by cold cathode
technology [2]. It is anticipated that either of these schemes, and potentially
any scheme, may come with an associated gain compression, as in Ref. [3] where
harmonic injection was used to set the fundamental output phase at a cost of
reducing output power. It is also possible that further study may show that any
tailoring of the velocity modulation may just be a manifestation of harmonic
injection, proving the usefulness of the complementary views of phase distortion
given in this note and in Refs. [3, 4].

We present observations of three-dimensional long-range ordered structures in Coulomb crystals
of 40Ca+ ions conﬁned in a linear rf Paul trap. In near-spherically symmetric crystals, we ﬁnd an
onset of body centered cubic structures in the crystal core when the number of ions exceeds ∼ 1000
ions, a much smaller number of ions expected to be needed from ground state molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. Previously, three-dimensional long-range structures have only been observed and
studied in Penning traps in systems of ∼ 100, 000 ions or more.

A Coulomb crystal is the solid state phase of a con-
ﬁned ensemble of Coulomb interacting particles with the
same sign of charge, often referred to as a one-component
plasma (OCP). Coulomb crystallization and properties
of Coulomb crystals have been studied for decades both
theoretically and experimentally in such a variety of
systems as 2D electron gases on super-ﬂuid helium [1]
and in quantum well structures [2], laser cooled ions in
traps [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and most recently dusty
plasmas [12]. In Nature, Coulomb crystals are presently
expected only to exist in exotic dense astrophysical ob-
jects [13].

For inﬁnite OCPs of a single species, the thermody-
namic properties are fully characterized by the coupling
parameter [14]

where Q is the charge of the particles, aws is the Wigner
Seitz radius deﬁned from the zero temperature particle
density n0 by 4πa3
ws/3 = 1/n0. Theoretically, a liquid-
solid transition to a body centered cubic (bcc) structure
is expected to occur for Γ ∼ 170 [15, 16]. For ﬁnite
OCPs the situation is more complex. The properties will
depend both on the size and shape of the ion plasma,
since surface eﬀects cannot be neglected [17, 18, 19, 20,
21].

Ion Coulomb crystals, which for more than a decade
have been realized with laser-cooled ion plasmas conﬁned
by electromagnetic ﬁelds in Penning traps [4, 5, 9] or in
radio-frequency (rf) traps [3, 6, 7, 8, 10], oﬀer an excel-
lent opportunity to study ﬁnite size eﬀects of OCPs un-
der various conditions. The Coulomb crystal structures
studied range from one-dimensional (1D) long cylindrical
crystals [3, 6, 7, 8] over 2D thin planar crystals [4] to 3D
spheroidal crystals [4, 5, 6, 9]. The 3D spheroidal ion
Coulomb crystals reported in Refs. [6, 7] are composed
of concentric ion shells formed under the inﬂuence of the
surface of the Coulomb crystals. Simulations indicate
that the ions form a near-2D hexagonal short-range or-

dered structure within each shell [18]. Similarly, shell and
short-range order have recently been observed in dusty
plasma experiments [12].

Observations of three-dimensional long-range order in
Coulomb crystals have previously only been reported
in the case of > 10, 000 laser-cooled ions in a Penning
trap [4, 5, 9]. In contrast to Penning traps, in rf traps
Coulomb crystals undergo strong quadrupole deforma-
tions at the frequency of the applied rf ﬁeld due to the
so-called micro-motion [22] of the ions. Since this motion
is known to produce heating [22, 23], it has not been ob-
vious that three-dimensional long-range order could be
obtained in rf traps.

In this Letter, we present observations of long-range
structure in Coulomb crystals of 40Ca+ ions conﬁned in
a linear rf Paul trap. By varying the number of ions
in near-spherically symmetric crystals, we have shown
that bcc structures indeed can be observed in such traps
with the number of ions below a thousand. Furthermore,
by varying the density of the ion plasma, experiments
have been performed to investigate the dependence of
ion plasma structure on the coupling parameter Γ.

The linear Paul trap used in the experiments is de-
scribed in detail in Ref. [24], so here we give only a
brief description of its basic properties. The linear Paul
trap consists essentially of four circular electrode rods in
a quadrupole conﬁguration. Radial conﬁnement of the
ions is obtained by applying a sinusoidally time-varying
rf-potential Urf cos Ωrf t to diagonally opposite electrodes
and the same time varying potential, but with a phase
shift of π, to the two remaining electrode rods. Static ax-
ial conﬁnement is achieved by having all electrode rods
sectioned into three parts with the eight end-pieces kept
at a positive dc potential Uend with respect to the four
center pieces. The electrode rod radius is 2.0 mm, and
the closest distance from the trap axis to the electrodes r0
is 3.5 mm. Each sectioned rod has a 5.4 mm long center-
piece and 20.0 mm long end-pieces. The frequency of the
rf ﬁeld is in all experiments Ωrf = 2π × 3.88 MHz. With
the deﬁnition given in Ref. [25] of the relevant stability

parameters q and a for the linear Paul trap under the
present operation conditions, the geometry of the trap
leads to q = 6.6 × 10−4Urf [V ] and a = 5.5 × 10−4Uend[V ].
In the experiments the rf-amplitude Urf [V ] is maximally
500 V, corresponding to qmax = 0.33. This value is small
enough that in all the experiments a harmonic pseudopo-
tential with rotational symmetry with respect to the trap
axis and a uniform zero temperature ion density given by
rf = 1.47 × 103Urf [V ]2 cm−3 can be
ntheo = ǫ0U 2
assumed (ǫ0 is the vacuum permittivity and m the mass
of the ion).

The 40Ca+ ions are produced isotope-selectively by
resonance-enhanced photo-ionization of atoms from an
eﬀusive beam of naturally abundant calcium [26, 27].
Doppler laser cooling is achieved along the trap center
axis by using counter propagating laser beams tuned to
the 4S1/2–4P1/2 transition at 397 nm and with a re-
pumper beam on the 3D3/2–4P1/2 transition at 866 nm.
The radial motion of the ions is cooled indirectly through
the Coulomb coupling of the radial and axial degrees of
freedom.

Two-dimensional projection images of the positions of
the ions in the trap are obtained by detecting the 397
nm light spontaneously emitted during the laser cooling
process by a CCD-camera equipped with an image inten-
siﬁer and a 14× magniﬁcation lens system. As indicated
in Fig. 1(a), the imaging optic is situated such that the
real crystal structure is projected to a plane including
the trap axis. Due to the rotational symmetry of the
Coulomb crystal boundary around the trap axis, we can
deduce from the images their real 3D sizes and hence the
number of ions by using the expression for the ion density
given above.

With an exposure time of 100 ms used in the experi-
ments, the quadrupole deformations of the Coulomb crys-
tal induced by the rf ﬁeld are averaged out in the images.
The direction of the micro-motion of the individual ions
is position dependent as indicated in Fig. 1(a). As a re-
sult, only ions close to the horizontal trap plane deﬁned
by the horizontal dashed line in Fig. 1(a) and the trap
axis, are imaged without micro-motion blurring due to
their micro-motion only being in the direction of view
(DV) of the camera system.

In Fig. 1(b), an image of a slightly prolate ion Coulomb
crystal consisting of about 2300 ions is presented. Clearly
visible is a hexagonal structure indicating that the ions,
at least close to the central trap plane, must be orga-
nized in a well-ordered structure.
In order to reveal if
the ordered structure persists not only very close to the
image plane, in another experiment, the Coulomb crystal
was moved down 40 µm by adding a positive dc voltage
to the upper two electrode rods as sketched in Fig. 1(c).
By doing this one achieves that it is a diﬀerent part of
the crystal that is close to the horizontal trap plane. As
seen in the image presented in Fig. 1(d), in this situ-
ation we still observe an ordered structure apart from

at the edges where the ﬂuorescence light originates from
ions not being close to the image plane. This experiment
substantiates that the ordered pattern observed indeed
originates from a three-dimensional long-range ordered
structure.

From the pre-knowledge that the ground state of larger
ion systems is a bcc conﬁguration [15, 16], it is tempt-
ing to assume that the observed structure is indeed a
bcc structure observed along the [111] direction. How-
ever, also simple cubic (sc) and face centered cubic (fcc)
structures will
lead to similar hexagonal patterns for
the same direction of observation. For a speciﬁc side
length d of the triangles making up the observed struc-
ture, the three cubic structures correspond, however, to
diﬀerent ion densities related by nbcc = 2nsc = 4nfcc.
The perfect agreement between the expected density of
ntheo = 2.3 ± 0.2 × 108 cm−3 with the one obtained from
the images nbcc = 2.1 ± 0.3 × 108 cm−3 assuming a bcc
structure, strongly supports that the observed structure

is indeed a bcc and certainly not a sc or fcc structure.
As seen from Fig. 2(a)–(c), the outer shape of the crys-
tal is not critical for observing the long-range structures,
at least not as long as the crystal is not too oblate or
prolate.

FIG. 2: Projection images of Coulomb crystals. The ﬁrst col-
umn shows three crystal images of the same ensemble of ∼
2000 ion with the trap potentials being Urf = 500 V and
(a) Uend = 27 V, (b) Uend = 33 V, and (c) Uend = 40
V, respectively. The second column represents images near-
spherical crystals for the same trap potentials Urf = 400 V
and Uend = 21 V. The number of ions in the crystals is (d)
1700, (e) 770, and (f) 290.

A series of measurements on near spheric crystals with
diﬀerent numbers of ions were done to investigate the
size eﬀect of the observation of three-dimensional long-
range structures. A few resulting images of this study
are presented in Fig. 2(d)–(f). Here, one observes, even
in the case of about 770 ions (Fig. 2(e)), very regular
structures in the projection images, while in Fig. 2(f)
(290 ions) no ordered structures are visible. From MD
simulations of ground state conﬁgurations of Coulomb
crystals, bcc structure has been predicted to be favorable
for & 5000 ions [28, 29]. As will be discussed in detail in
a separate publication, there are good reasons to believe
that the observed long-range structures are due to the
ﬁnite thermal temperature [30].

When comparing Fig. 2(d) and (e), it is evident that
the relative number of ions in the regular structure de-

3

creases with the size of the crystals, as may be expected
since the outer layer of the crystals is always spheroidal
shaped. Another size dependent quantity noticed is the
frequency at which ordered structures are indeed ob-
served: The smaller the crystals the more unlikely it is
to observe the regular structures. In all cases, since the
exposure time of 100 ms is many orders of magnitude
larger that both the rf-period and the timescale of crys-
tal vibrations (∼ 1/ωplasma, with ωplasma ∼ 1 MHz being
the plasma frequency), the crystal structures are at least
to be considered as metastable states.

To investigate the dependence of the observed long-
range order on the coupling parameter Γ, the rf voltage
Urf and correspondingly the end-piece voltage Uend were
varied in a series of experiments such that a ∼ 2000 ion
Coulomb system stayed spherical, but at diﬀerent ion
densities. In Fig. 3, three projection images for an ion
density of (a) 2.3×108 cm−3, (b) 1.3×108 cm−3, and (c)
0.6×108 cm−3 are presented. Unfortunately, it has not
been possible to measure the temperature of the ions in
the crystals, but MD simulations with 2685 ions in an
eﬀective spherical harmonic potential have shown shell
structures similar to those presented in Fig. 4(c) when
Γ ∼ 200. With this as a reference, Fig. 4(a) and (b) cor-
responds to Γ ∼ 340 and Γ ∼ 280, respectively. The tem-
perature of the ions must accordingly be ∼ 5 mK, which
seems reasonable with the Doppler limit being ∼ 0.5 mK
for 40Ca+. The above inferred values of Γ agree very
well with previous MD simulations predicting Coulomb
crystallization for a 2000 ion system to appear ﬁrst when
Γ > 250 [20].

FIG. 3: Projection images of the same ion ensemble in a near-
spherical eﬀective trap potential obtained with the trap po-
tentials being (a) Urf =400 V and Uend = 21 V, (b) Urf = 300
V and Uend = 12 V, and Urf = 200 V and Uend = 5.3 V ,
respectively.

For crystals with more than ∼ 2000 ions, regular
projection images are observed, which suggests three-
dimensional long-range ordering diﬀerent from bcc.
In
Fig. 4, two images of the same ion ensemble (∼ 13, 000
ions) at two diﬀerent instants are presented. While the
hexagonal structure of Fig. 4(a) and (b) with d = 17.2 ±
0.8 µm again is compatible with a bcc structure, the rect-
angular structure observed in Fig. 4(c) and (d) cannot be
interpreted as another projection of a bcc structure, but

has to relate to another structure. The sides of the rect-
angle are h = 15.2±0.5 µm and w = 9.71±0.2 µm, which
yields a ratio of the sides of h/w = 1.55 ± 0.06. We do
not ﬁnd that any projection of cubic crystal structures
exactly complies with this ratio, but the fcc structure pro-
jected in the [211] direction comes close as this has the
ratio h/w = p8/3 ≃ 1.63. For the expected ion density
of ntheo = (2.2 ± 0.2) × 108 cm−3 the corresponding side
lengths of the projected rectangles should for a fcc struc-
ture have been h = 15.2 ± 0.5 µm and w = 9.3 ± 0.3 µm,
which does not disagree with the side lengths deduced
from the image. The origin of the small discrepancy be-
tween the observed and the predicted ratio is at present
unknown, but an explanation could probably be found in
a micro-motion induced distortion of the fcc lattice. The
observation of fcc structures is not so surprising since
such structure have already been observed for larger near-
spherical Coulomb crystals in Penning traps [5]. Further-
more, MD simulations have as well predicted very small
diﬀerences in the potential energies of bcc and fcc struc-
tures for larger crystals [29].

The reason why the observed bcc or fcc structures al-
ways seem to appear oriented in a very speciﬁc direction
is still not completely understood. However, the non-
perfect cylindrical symmetry of the quadrupole trap con-
ﬁguration and the corresponding micro-motion as well as
small patch potentials may play a role.

4

micro-motion of ions in Coulomb crystals in linear rf Paul
traps, it is indeed possible to obtain three-dimensional
long-range ordering. Furthermore, such ordered struc-
tures can surprisingly be observed for Coulomb crystals
consisting of less than 1000 ions.

Abstract

×

The statistical properties of the E
B ﬂux in diﬀerent types of plasma turbulence
simulations are investigated using probability density distribution functions (PDF).
The physics included in the models ranges from two dimensional drift-wave turbu-
lence to three dimensional MHD simulations. The PDFs of the ﬂux surface averaged
transport are in good agreement with an extreme value distribution (EVD). This is
interpreted as a signature of localized vortical structures dominating the transport
on a ﬂux surface. Models accounting for a local input of energy and including the
global evolution of background proﬁles show a more bursty behaviour in 2D as well
as 3D simulations of interchange and drift type turbulence. Although the PDFs
are not Gaussian, again no algebraic tails are observed. The tails are, in all cases
considered, in excellent agreement with EVDs.

1 Introduction

In hot magnetised plasmas the main cross-ﬁeld transport is often found to
be far larger than expected for diﬀusive transport due to collisions. In plasma
physics the transport is then called anomalous while in ﬂuid dynamics ”strange”
or ”anomalous” transport signiﬁes the non-diﬀusive character of the transport.
We investigate the statistical properties of the turbulent particle ﬂux with the
aim to examine the anomality of the transport in the ﬂuid sense of meaning.
An important feature stressed by many authors is the non-Gaussianty of the
PDF of the point-wise measured ﬂux [1,2,3,4]. While the non-Gaussianity of
the ﬂux PDF is to be expected from a quantity that itself is a folding of two sta-
tistical variables, namely density and radial velocity, the observation of power

law tails in the ﬂux PDF would be an indication of anomalous transport in
the ﬂuid sense of the wording, that is non-diﬀusive transport behaviour. Cor-
respondingly this would indicate the presence of long range correlations in the
turbulence [5]. Experimental results showing ﬁnite size scaling and similarity
of transport PDFs measured in diﬀerent experimental devices have recently
been reported in Refs. [6,7]. These measurements have shown that transport
in the edge and scrape-oﬀ layer (SOL) region of fusion devices is highly in-
termittent, self similar and does in its statistical features not vary much be-
tween machines of diﬀerent sizes and geometries. A characteristic feature of
the transport seems to be the non-Gaussianity observed in its PDF and its
intermittency. Intermittent transport would indicate that indeed the particle
transport is anomalous not only in the sense that it is not due to collisions, but
also in the sense that it is non-diﬀusive. A non-diﬀusive transport, however,
has distinct scaling properties, which would pose much stricter conditions on
the design of the vessel surrounding a fusion device, as this has to withstand
the largest likely transport event. Additionally, a number of fundamental ques-
tions in relation to transport PDFs are still unanswered, so it is as yet unclear
what ingredients are needed to produce a certain transport PDF. Are trans-
port PDFs dependent on the driving mechanism behind the turbulence? How
does diﬀerent physics enter into the transport PDF? Here we present initial
answers to some of these questions by analysing direct numerical simulations
of various types of plasma turbulence in diﬀerent geometries.

2 Local turbulence Models

In this section we consider plasma turbulence in a classical sense, namely as
being based on a scale separation between the equilibrium and ﬂuctuations,
f.x. density ﬂuctuations are assumed small compared the the equilibrium den-
sity ˜n/n00 << 1. The ﬂuid equations for drift micro-turbulence result from
standard ordering based upon the slowness of the dynamics compared to the
ion gyro-frequency Ωi = eB/Mi and hence the smallness of the drift scale ρs
compared to the background pressure gradient scale length L⊥. These quan-
tities and the sound speed cs are deﬁned by

where subscripts e and i refer to electrons and ions respectively, and the tem-
perature is given in units of energy. Normalization is in terms of scaled depen-
dent variables (electrostatic potential eφ/Te, electron density n/n00, parallel
ion velocity u/cs, parallel electric current J/n00ecs; respectively). In addition
the dependent quantities are scaled with the small parameter δ = ρs/L⊥, so

2.1 Two dimensional drift turbulence

Assuming electrostatic motion, neglecting eletron inertia and replacing parallel
derivatives by an eﬀective parallel wavelength Lq we arrive at the well known
Hasegawa-Wakatani equations [8] (HWE), describing two dimensional drift-
wave turbulence in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld line curvature:

∂x is used to write the non-linear

terms originating from advection with the E

the turbulence is driven by the resistive instability. We solve the HWE on a
double periodic domain [9] and typically we use 256
256 modes on a square
of side length L = 40. To produce self-consistent stationary turbulence we
start the simulations from low amplitude (10−6) random density ﬂuctuations
and initialise all other ﬁelds to zero. The ﬂuctuations grow due to the resistive
instability and saturate with amplitudes of order one. After saturation [10] we
measure the local turbulent radial particle transport (x-direction) as given in
a single point:

which in the two dimensional context is trivially obtained by averaging over
the poloidal coordinate y. Density and potential ﬂuctuations have PDFs that
are well described by Gaussians. Consequently the PDF of the E

Γn,loc, as depicted in Fig. 1, is close to the functional form expected from

Thus the ﬂux surfaced averaged transport is to lowest order positive deﬁnite,
as conﬁrmed by the numerical simulations. It is thus the PDF of the logarithm
of the transport, ln Γn,FS, that converges towards a Gaussian, if the central

An alternative description of the statistical properties of the ﬂux can be made
in terms of the extreme value distribution (EVD). For a statistical variable –
here the averaged ﬂux – that is dominated by the minimum or maximum of a
large number of random observations – here the local ﬂux events – the EVD
arises[11]:

The EVD has recently been used successfully to model and explain statistical
properties of electron pressure ﬂuctuations in a non-conﬁnement plasma ex-
periment [12]. As seen from Fig. 2 the EVD explains the observed transport
PDF in this case as well as the lognormal distribution and is indistinguishable
from the former. One should, however, note that the EVD decays faster than
the lognormal one and, thus, is better suited to describe statistical variables
that are limited not only from below, but also from above. Clearly the max-
imum transport event in all real world systems is limited by the system size.
We interpret the present situation in the sense that the ﬂux surface averaged
transport is dominated by extreme events, probably mediated by transport
events linked to vortical structures. The ﬂux PDF itself in this case is natu-
rally skewed, but the radial particle transport is by no means ’strange’ in the
sense of not being diﬀusive on large time and space scales. No power law tail
is observed in the data. That indeed the transport is diﬀusive is augmented
by the fact, that the radial dispersion of ideal test-particles in 2D Hasegawa-
Wakatani turbulence is found to be asymptotically diﬀusive as well [13,14].

2.2 Drift-Alfv´en and MHD turbulence

Next we consider electromagnetic drift-Alfv´en turbulence with magnetic ﬁeld
curvature eﬀects. The geometry is a three dimensional ﬂux tube with local
slab-like coordinates [x, y, s] [15] and the model is deﬁned by the temporal
evolution of the following four scalar ﬁelds: electrostatic potential φ, density n
given by electron density continuity equation, parallel current J, and parallel

where τe is the electron collision time and the factor 0.51 reﬂects the parallel
resistivity [16]. The competition between these three parameters, representing
magnetic induction, electron inertia, and resistive relaxation determines the
response of J to the force imbalance in Eq. (12). The simulations are per-
2π in
formed on a grid with 64
x, y, s. Some runs were repeated with double resolution to ensure convergence.
Standard parameters for the runs were ˆµ = 5, ˆs = 1, ωB = 0.05 with the vis-
cosities set to µw = µn = 0.025.
A transition in the dynamical behaviour from drift-Alfv´en to turbulence dom-
inated by MHD modes is in this model triggered by increasing the ratio of
ˆβ/ˆµ. To check the nature of the observed turbulence we evaluate the phase
shift α between density and potential ﬂuctuations in dependence of ky using
the relationship αky = log I(φkyn∗
ky). For better statistics the phase is aver-
aged along the parallel coordinate s and time. Fig. 3 shows for a low value
ˆβ = 0.5 and a high value ˆβ = 50 the change in principal behaviour of the
turbulence with increasing ˆβ. A shift towards larger phase angles is observed
for low ky-modes indicating the transition from drift-Alfv´en to MHD type of
turbulence. As the turbulence character changes to become more of the MHD
type the phase relationship between density and potential is altered. This is
also reﬂected in a visual inspection of the spatial transport structure (Fig. 4).
It shows that the transport for high values of ˆβ is carried by larger structures

than for low ˆβ. The local ﬂux Γn,loc has the interesting structure that outward
(white) and inward (dark) transport regions are closely related, this reﬂects
the fact that the transport is carried in localized structures, having an outward
ﬂux at the one side and an inward ﬂux at the other side. They are linked to
corresponding eddies in the vorticity ﬁeld.
In both regimes the turbulence decreases the equilibrium density gradient by
10% in the stationary turbulence, a further deviation from the
about 5
background density gradient is prevented by a feed-back mechanism in two
damping layers at the inner and outer radial boundary, which drive the ﬂux-
surface averaged density towards the initially speciﬁed values. The PDFs of
transport related quantities for ˆβ = 0.5 and ˆβ = 50 are shown in Figs. 5 and
6. In the low beta case density and potential ﬂuctuations have PDFs that are
very well described by Gaussians, with minor deviations from Gaussianity in
the tails. Density and potential have a rather similar PDF as they are well
correlated and consequently the ﬁtted folded Gaussian PF G Eq. (6) describes
rather well the point-wise ﬂux PDF (c = 0.2) . An indication of a power-law
tail in the point-wise ﬂux PDF is not observed, and the point-wise ﬂux PDF
decays exponentially. The PDF of the magnetic ﬂux surface averaged density
ﬂux Γn,FS, shown in Fig. 5 c), is much closer to a shifted Gaussian, depicted for
comparison in the ﬁgure, but we observe a “fat-tail” towards larger transport

ﬁts the data well, but over-predicts the tail, an indication of the fact that the
transport is limited from above as well, as we are considering a ﬁnite system.
Indeed the EVD with parameters h0 = 2.60 and g = 0.34 ﬁts the data very
well, especially the tail of the PDF. For the MHD situation with ˆβ = 50 —
even though the phase relation between density and potential diﬀers and the
turbulence has diﬀerent character — we observe transport statistics similar to
the drift-Alfv´en case. The corresponding PDFs for this case are depicted in
Fig. 6. As the density and potential ﬂuctuations are less well coupled in that
regime the PDFs of density and potential diﬀer more. The potential ﬂuctua-
tions also deviate more from a Gaussian. Compared to the density ﬂuctuations
they now have a larger width. Note that the ﬂuctuation level has increased
signiﬁcantly as well as the transport level when compared to the low beta
case. Nevertheless the PDF of the point-wise measured transport is still well
described by a folded Gaussian as seen in Fig. 6 b. The ﬂux surface averaged
transport is shown in comparison with a ﬁtted EVD and a Gaussian. The log-
normal distribution function is not plotted here, as it is very close to the EVD.
The ﬂux surface averaged transport behaviour has changed little as compared
to the low beta case. It is still much closer to an EVD (or log-normal) than
to a Gaussian one, however, we observe that to the low transport side the
Gaussian distribution ﬁts the transport PDF better. This eﬀect is due to en-
hanced levels of small noisy transport events occurring in the MHD type of
simulation and the ﬂux PDF is more inﬂuenced by these small scale “random”
transport events. Their distribution centers around zero, while the large scales
reproduce the global transport PDF and carry the net ﬂux. The small scale
transport events then make an appearance in the transport PDF for small av-
eraged ﬂuxes, which explains the nearly Gaussian behaviour of the ﬂux PDF
on the low transport side.

3 Global Models

After having considered local models we now drop the scale separation between
turbulent ﬂuctuations and equilibrium — or in the cases where no equilibrium
exists, as in the SOL, between ﬂuctuations and time averaged background. A
motivation for this is that in the edge the ﬂuctuation level is of the same
order of magnitude as the background and going out into the SOL region
the ﬂuctuations in density can actually exceed the average density by a large
factor. However, regarding ﬂuctuations and background on the same footing
requires that the system is integrated to much longer times and thus higher
demands in terms of computational power. We thus consider a two dimensional
and a simple three dimensional model.

Here the coupling between the equations is exclusively due to the curvature

hand sides represent sources of particles and heat, while the σ-terms operating
in the SOL (Fig. 7) are sinks due to the parallel loss to end plates along open
ﬁeld lines. Boundary conditions correspond to free-slip, while in normalized
units n = T = 1 at x = Lx and ∂n/∂x = ∂T /∂x = 0 at x = 0, see Fig.7.
For strong forcing the system is unstable to interchange modes causing signif-
icant convective transport. A novel property of this model is the non-linear
conservation of the energy integral E =
, revealing the
conservative transfer of energy from thermal to kinetic form due to magnetic
i
ﬁeld curvature. A realistic modeling of this process is mandatory for predictive
global models. Nevertheless the solutions for strong forcing shows the charac-
teristic “on-oﬀ” character of the turbulence due to self-sustained sheared ﬂows

Fig. 8. PDF of pointwise and ﬂux surface averaged transport inside LCFS and in
the SOL

numerical simulation of that model is very diﬀerent from the ones obtained for
the ﬂuctuation based model. The ﬂux surface averaged transport is no longer
constant and instead varies with radial position as density is lost in the par-
allel direction. We here take the transport data from a long timeseries since it
is impossible to use spatial homogeneity in the radial direction to increase the
quality of the statistics. It here makes sense to compare ﬂux PDF’s by normal-
ising them to their root mean square. Fig. 8 shows the PDFs of the point-wise
and the ﬂux-surface averaged transport at radial positions corresponding to
the edge and the SOL part of the simulation domain, (P1 and P4 in Fig. 7).
A slight tendency to larger ﬂux events in the SOL is observed. Averaging the
transport poloidally has less dramatic eﬀects than for the models considered
in Section 2. The reason for this is the large poloidal correlation lengths of
the order of the poloidal size of the simulation domain. Fig. 9 demonstrates

if the data are additionally averaged over times longer than the times between
bursts, we observe a behaviour that can as well be approximated by a power
law PDF as an EVD (Fig. 10). The amount of data being in the tail is small in
that case, and the data-range is about 1.5 decades in Γ and down from six to
only two decades in the ordinate (Fig. 9). One should note that whenever the
variance of the data is large the body of a EVD will be similar to a straight
line in a log-log plot, while its tail decays with increasing slope in the log-log
plot. This shows the danger of ﬁtting a PDF only for a very limited range in a
doubly logarithmic plot. Our interpretation is thus, that to observe a distinct
behaviour of the tail of the transport PDF one needs to be able to ﬁt data over
at least two decades and that ﬁtting data on smaller regions is highly arbitrary
and not suited to distinguish between diﬀerent interpretations of the data.

3.2 Electrostatic Drift Model

Finally we consider a three dimensional global version of drift-wave equations.
The model uses quasi-neutrality and electron density continuity, together with
the parallel force balance equations for ions and electrons. Parallel convection
is kept. No assumptions are made on the scale length of the background gradi-
1
ent compared to the ﬂuctuation scales, e.g. the constraint
as underlying f.x. the HWE Eqs.: (2) and (3) is dropped. The resulting system
is written in terms of the logarithm of density N = log(n):

The energetic coupling is due to the parallel current dynamics that is by the
diﬀerence in parallel electron velocity V and parallel ion velocity U. Now
coupling due to curvature is absent from the equations. Again, the density is
the full density evolving and is fed into the system on the inner side, while
on the radially outer third of the system Bohm-sheath boundary conditions
are implemented. The inner two thirds of the radius have periodic boundary
conditions in the parallel direction. The y-direction is periodic and ﬁxed values
are imposed on ﬁeld quantities at the outer radial boundary, while the diﬀusive
ﬂuxes are set to zero at the inner radial boundary by prescribing a zero radial
gradient there. The system is solved on a 128x64x30 grid. Due to the heavy
computational load of that system it could not be integrated to times as high

on bulk and tail of distribution and in the SOL (right) with EVD ﬁtted on the tail
of the distribution.

in this case shows distinct diﬀerences between edge region (closed ﬁeld lines)
and SOL with open ﬁeld lines and losses to the limiter plates. For the edge
region the poloidal correlation length is shorter than the box length and thus
the PDF of the averaged transport is similar to that of the 2D- and 3D drift
wave model. It ﬁts well with an EVD in the tail and in the bulk (see Fig. 11).
The ﬂux PDF in the SOL part of the domain bears the characteristics of long
poloidal correlations observed in that regime, due to the ﬂute modes – rather
than drift waves – dominating the dynamics in the SOL. Thus the shape of the
transport PDF, also after ﬂux surface averaging, is very similar to that of the
interchange model (see. Figs. 8 and 9), demonstrating also the applicability
of 2D models in the SOL. However, the tail of the PDF again does not show
any sign of a power law behaviour and can over the whole range be ﬁtted very
well with an EVD.

4 Conclusion

Direct numerical simulations of physically distinct models of ﬂute and drift
modes in two and three dimensional geometries have been presented and anal-
ysed in terms of the transport PDF. For the ﬂuctuation based models non-
linear structures in the plasma dominate the transport, but give rise to a
diﬀusive turbulent transport rather than a super-diﬀusion or otherwise anoma-
lous (in the ﬂuid sense) transport. Consequently a Gyro-Bohm like scaling of
the transport with the magnetic ﬁeld is found. Similar behaviour has recently
been reported in investigations on test particle transport in plasma turbulence
[14,18].
There is little diﬀerence in the results concerning diﬀerent physical models. If
the energy input into the system is changed from a homogeneous input due
to a local, ﬁxed pressure gradient to a localized plasma source and sink re-

13

gions are added the transport PDF becomes more bursty and longer poloidal
correlations arise. Also in this situation the tails of all ﬂux PDFs considered
are extremely well ﬁtted by extreme value distributions. Thus, the deviation
of the point-wise as well as the ﬂux surface averaged ﬂux from Gaussianity is,
at least in the asymptotic limit of large system size, not due to anomalous —
in the sense of non-diﬀusive — behaviour. The presented observations should
not be interpreted as indicators for the presence of self organized criticality.
An interpretation in terms of occurrence of extreme transport events, which
may be caused by localized eddies seems to be more appealing. The statistics
describing the transport PDF should therefor be taken from extreme value
statistics, which in all cases ﬁts the tails of the observed transport PDF very
well.

Abstract

Two applications of the Noether method for ﬂuids and plasmas are presented based on the Euler-

Lagrange and Euler-Poincar´e variational principles, which depend on whether the dynamical ﬁelds

are to be varied independently or not, respectively. The relativistic cold laser-plasma equations,

describing the interaction between an intense laser ﬁeld with a cold relativistic electron plasma,

provide a useful set of equations amenable to both variational formulations. The derivation of con-

servation laws by Noether method proceeds from the Noether equation, whose form depends on the

variational formulation used. As expected, the expressions for the energy-momentum conservation

laws are identical in both variational formulations. The connection between the two Lagrangian

densities is shown to involve the mass conservation and Lin constraints associated with the cold

relativistic electron ﬂuid.

INTRODUCTION

The Noether method [1] is used in many areas of physics to relate symmetry properties

of Lagrangians to important conservation laws for dissipationless dynamical equations such

as energy, momentum, and wave action. Most conventional applications of the Noether

method in classical and quantum ﬁeld theories [2, 3, 4] focus on a variational formulation that

considers independent variations of all dynamical ﬁelds. The purpose of this paper is to show

how the Noether method can be applied to derive the energy-momentum conservation law

for a set of dissipationless plasma-ﬂuid equations from two diﬀerent variational formulations,

which diﬀer by their treatment of ﬁeld variations.

We begin with an expression for a typical action functional in ﬁeld theory [2]:

A[ψa] =

d4x L(ψa, ∂µψa),

D

Z

where the multi-component ﬁeld ψa(x, t) represents the state of the system at position x and

time t (the index a is used to represent a ﬁeld component) and we assume that the multi-

component ﬁeld is constrained to the space-time domain D in the course of its evolution.

In the present Section, a covariant notation is used in terms of the Minkowski metric tensor
ηµν = diag(1, −1, −1, −1), the inﬁnitesimal space-time volume is d4x = cdt d3x, and ∂µ =
(c−1∂t, ∇) is the covariant space-time gradient. The ﬁeld equation for the dissipationless
time evolution of the multi-component ﬁeld ψ(x, t) is derived from a variational principle

based on variations of the action functional (1):

δA[ψa] = A[ψa + δψa] − A[ψa] =

δL(ψa, ∂µψa) d4x

where the variations δψa are assumed to vanish on the boundary ∂D of the space-time

domain D.

The stationarity of the action leads to the variational principle

δA[ψa] =

δL(ψa, ∂µψa) d4x = 0.

D

Z

The outcome of the variational principle (3) is a set of partial diﬀerential equations involving

the Lagrangian density L and its partial derivatives while the speciﬁc form of these equations

depends on whether the variations δψa are independent or not. These two cases lead to the

(1)

Euler-Lagrange equations [3] and the Euler-Poincar´e equations [5], respectively. As a result

of the variational principle (3), the variation δL of the Lagrangian density becomes the

Noether equation

δL ≡ ∂µ Λµ,

(4)

where the four-density Λµ is expressed in terms of partial derivatives of the Lagrangian

density L. The Noether method associates symmetries of the Lagrangian density L with

local conservation laws as will be shown below.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the standard application

of the Noether method based on an Euler-Lagrange variational principle is reviewed. A

general expression for the Euler-Lagrange form of the energy-momentum conservation law is

derived by Noether method based on symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange Lagrangian density

with respect to space-time translations. Some of the invariance properties of the energy-

momentum conservation law are also investigated within the context of the symmetry of the

energy-momentum tensor.

In Sec. III, the relativistic cold laser-plasma equations [6] describing the interaction be-

tween an intense laser ﬁeld with a cold relativistic electron plasma in the presence of a neu-

tralizing ﬁxed-ion background. This example provides a useful set of equations amenable

to both Euler-Lagrange and Euler-Poincar´e variational formulations and each application of

the Noether method leads to the same energy-momentum conservation law. In the Euler-

Lagrange variational formulation, the dynamical ﬁelds (ϕ, A; n, ψ, α, β) include the elec-

tromagnetic potentials (ϕ, A), the electron density n, and the Clebsch potentials (ψ, α, β)

used to represent the relativistic electron canonical momentum P ≡ ∇ψ + α ∇β (in the

present work, the curl-free case P = ∇ψ discussed in Ref. [6] is generalized by considering
∇ × P = ∇α × ∇β 6= 0). In the Euler-Poincar´e variational formulation, on the other hand,

the Clebsch potentials (ψ, α, β) are replaced by the electron ﬂuid velocity v. We also show

that these two Lagrangian densities are in fact connected by a simple formula. Lastly, we

summarize our work in Sec. V.

II. CONSERVATION LAWS OF EULER-LAGRANGE EQUATIONS

Standard Euler-Lagrange (EL) ﬁeld equations are derived from the variational principle

(3) when the variations δψa are all independent. The variation δL of the Lagrangian density

3

in Eq. (2) is, thus, explicitly written as

δL =

where the exact space-time divergence is obtained by rearranging terms with

The stationarity of the action functional associated with the variational principle (3) yields

0 =

∂L

∂(∂µψa) # )

,

where the exact space-time divergence ∂µΛµ drops out under the assumption that the vari-

ations δψa vanish on ∂D.

Following the standard rules of Calculus of Variations [3], the condition that Eq. (7) holds

for any variation δψa yields the Euler-Lagrange equation for the ﬁeld-component ψa:

∂

.

Since the Euler-Lagrange equations (8) hold for arbitrary variations δψa, the variational

equation (5) becomes

δL ≡

∂Λµ

∂xµ =

δψa

which is the Euler-Lagrange form of the Noether equation.

The standard application of the Noether method involves the derivation of the energy-

momentum conservation law. For this purpose, we consider arbitrary space-time translations

(xν → xν +δxν) generated by the space-time displacement δxν. Under this space-time trans-

formation, the variations of the ﬁeld-components and the Lagrangian density are expressed

as

where ∂′

νL ≡ (∂νL)|ψa denotes the space-time derivative of L at constant ﬁeld ψa. The

energy-momentum conservation law is written in terms of the energy-momentum tensor

δψa ≡ − δxν ∂νψa

δL ≡ − ∂ν(δxν L) + δxν ∂′

Hence, when the Lagrangian density L is independent of the space-time coordinate xλ (i.e.,
∂′
λL = 0), Noether’s theorem yields the energy-momentum conservation law ∂µT µ

λ = 0.

When the background medium is time independent, the energy conservation law is written
as ∂E/∂t + ∇ · S = 0, where the energy density E and the energy-density ﬂux S are deﬁned

When the background medium is homogeneous, on the other hand, the momentum con-

momentum-stress tensor T are deﬁned as

Note that the energy conservation law is invariant under the transformation

where the vector C is an arbitrary function of space and time. The momentum conservation

law, on the other hand, is invariant under the transformation

while E = − ∇ϕ − c−1∂tA and B = ∇ × A are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds expressed in
terms of the electromagnetic potentials (ϕ, A). In Eq. (19), the neutralizing ﬁxed-ion density

N is assumed to be nonuniform (∇N 6= 0) but is taken to be time-independent (otherwise,

the ion continuity equation would require ion ﬂow). We note that, while the vector potential

A includes both the laser ﬁeld (A0) and the ﬁeld (Ap) induced by the plasma current

response, the scalar potential ϕ represents only the ﬁeld (ϕp) induced by the plasma charge-

separation response. Furthermore, we note that the assumption of a cold relativistic electron

plasma is justiﬁed by the large electron quiver velocities vq = − eA0/(mec) generated by the

intense laser ﬁeld, which dominate over the random thermal motion of electrons. Although

thermal eﬀects can easily be incorporated within a Lagrangian formulation, they represent

unecessary complications for our present purposes.

We now show that this set of equations can be represented either in terms of an Euler-

Lagrange variational formulation or an Euler-Poincar´e variational formulation. The Euler-

Lagrange formulation presented below focuses its attention on the relativistic electron canon-

ical momentum P = p−eA/c instead of the relativistic electron kinetic momentum p, which

satisﬁes the relativistic canonical momentum equation

obtained from Eq. (18). From Eq. (22), we note that the dynamical evolution of the mo-
mentum vorticity Ω ≡ ∇ × P is expressed as ∂Ω/∂t = ∇ × (v × Ω), which implies that

the evolution of Ω requires that its initial value be nonzero (i.e., if the electron canonical

momentum is initially curl-free, it remains so during its subsequent evolution). The Euler-

Poincar´e formulation, on the other hand, considers variations in electron density n and ﬂuid

velocity v to be constrained by the conservation of mass, i.e., the variations δn and δv must

satisfy the perturbed continuity equation

Hence, Eq. (29) implies that the total momentum is conserved in the direction where the

electric ﬁeld vanishes. Note that, while the momentum-stress tensor in the primitive form

of the momentum conservation law (28) is not symmetric, the ﬁnal form of the momentum-

(cid:21)

(29)

(30)

(31)

stress tensor (31) is symmetric.

A. Euler-Lagrange Formulation

The Euler-Lagrange formulation of the relativistic cold laser-plasma equations (17)-(20) is

based on the use of Clebsch (or Euler) potentials [7]. According to the Clebsch representation
associated with the general vorticity condition (Ω = ∇ × P 6= 0), the relativistic electron

canonical momentum is expressed as

P = mγ v −

A ≡ ∇ψ + α ∇β,

(32)

where the Clebsch potentials ψ, α, β are functions of space and time. As will be shown

below, the potential ψ may be viewed as a Lagrange multiplier associated with the mass

conservation law (e.g., the continuity equation), while the potentials α and β ensure that
∇ × P = ∇α × ∇β 6= 0. Furthermore, the Lin constraints [7] on the Clebsch potentials α

and β requires that the potentials α and β be carried by the ﬂuid ﬂow in the sense that

∂α
∂t

∂β
∂t

+ v · ∇α = 0 =

+ v · ∇β,

(33)

i.e., the potentials α and β are known as Lagrangian-marker coordinates [8, 9]. Note that
under a gauge transformation (ϕ, A) → (ϕ − c−1∂tχ, A + ∇χ), the Clebsch potential ψ

e
c

8

obeys the gauge transformation ψ → ψ − (e/c) χ while the Lagrangian-marker coordinates

α and β are invariant. Lastly, a more symmetric expression for the Clebsch representation

of the relativistic canonical momentum can also be obtained by writing Eq. (32) as

P = ∇ψ′ +

(α ∇β − β ∇α),

1
2

which involves a redeﬁnition of the Clebsch potential ψ′ = ψ + 1

2 αβ.

The Lagrangian density in the Euler-Lagrange formulation of the relativistic cold laser-

plasma equations (17), (19)-(20), and (22) is

(17), (19)-(20), and (33) are easily recovered. The last variational equation, which corre-

time translations t → t + δt, such that δψ = − δt ∂tψ, δβ = − δt ∂tβ, δϕ = − δt ∂tϕ,

δA = − δt ∂tA = c δt (E + ∇ϕ),

and δLEL = − δt ∂tLEL (where we use the fact that the ﬁxed-ion density N is time-

independent). Substituting these expressions into Eq. (40), we ﬁrst obtain

momentum conservation law (29) follows.

(17)-(20) is expressed in terms of the Lagrangian density

velocity v, which are subject to the mass conservation constraint (23), are expressed in

terms of the virtual ﬂuid displacement δξ as

δn = − ∇ · (n δξ) and δv =

Relativistically covariant expressions for the Eulerian variations for the proper density N =
γ−1 n and the ﬂuid four-velocity uµ = (γc, γv) are found in Ref. [10]; here, we prefer the

Eulerian variations of n and v for the sake of simplicity.

The variation of the Euler-Poincar´e Lagrangian density can be expressed as

where P = m γv − (e/c) A denotes the relativistic canonical momentum and we have rear-

extracted the Noether space-time divergence.

As a result of the variational principle

(45)

the relativistic cold laser-plasma equations (19)-(20) and (22) are easily recovered (under

arbitrary variations δϕ, δA, and δξ, respectively) with the continuity equation (17) repre-

senting a constraint equation. Since these variational equations hold for arbitrary variations

in (ξ, ϕ, A), the expression for the variation (43) of the Lagrangian density can now be

written as the Euler-Poincar´e form of the Noether equation

which can now be used to derive the conservation laws of energy and momentum for the

relativistic cold plasma-laser equations.

To derive the energy-momentum conservation laws within the Euler-Poincar´e formulation,

the virtual ﬂuid displacement δξ is expressed in terms of the space and time translations δx

and δt as

δξ = δx − v δt,

(46)

where v is the ﬂuid velocity. Note that the relativistic approach used here is based on con-

strained variations of the laboratory-frame electron ﬂuid density and electron ﬂuid velocity;

an alternative approach is based on constrained variations of rest-frame ﬂuid quantities.

1. Energy conservation law for the relativistic cold laser-plasma equations

The conservation law of energy is derived from the Noether equation (45) by considering

time translations t → t + δt, such that δξ = − v δt, δϕ = − δt ∂tϕ,

δA = − δt ∂tA = c δt (E + ∇ϕ),

12

and δLEP = − δt ∂tLEP (where we use the fact that the ﬁxed-ion density N is time-

independent). Substituting these expressions into Eq. (45), we ﬁrst obtain

we recover the primitive form (24) of the energy conservation law, from which the energy

2. Momentum conservation law for the relativistic cold laser-plasma equations

The conservation law of momentum is derived from the Noether equation (45) by con-

sidering space translations x → x + δx, such that δξ = δx,

δϕ = − δx · ∇ϕ = δx ·

and δLEP = − ∇ · (δx LEP ) + δx · ∇′LEP (where ∇′LEP = − eϕ ∇N for a nonuniform

ﬁxed-ion density). Substituting these expressions into Eq. (45), we ﬁrst obtain

Next, by substituting the expression P = mγv − (e/c) A for the relativistic canonical mo-

mentum, we recover the primitive form (28) of the momentum conservation law, from which

the momentum conservation law (29) follows.

C. Connection between the Lagrangian Densities

We have thus far shown that the relativistic cold laser-plasma equations (17)-(20) can

be represented in terms of two diﬀerent variational principles based on either the Euler-

Lagrange Lagrangian density (35) or the Euler-Poincar´e Lagrangian density (41). We now

13

show the connection between these two Lagrangians. We begin by evaluating the diﬀerence:

LEL − LEP = − n

∂β

− n mc2

(48)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Next, by making use of Eq. (47) with the Clebsch representation (34) for the canonical

momentum P, the diﬀerence (48) becomes

LEL − LEP = − n

Here, the ﬁrst term can be written as an exact space-time divergence plus a term involving

the continuity equation and, thus, the diﬀerence LEL − LEP is expressed as

LEL − LEP = −

(49)

Lastly, since two Lagrangian densities that diﬀer by an exact space-time divergence are

considered equivalent (i.e., they generate identical dynamical equations), we may eliminate

the exact space-time divergence from the right side of Eq. (49) to obtain the ﬁnal expression

LEL = LEP + ψ′

for the Euler-Lagrange Lagrangian density LEL given in terms of the Euler-Poincar´e La-
grangian density LEP , the mass-conservation constraint (17) (with Lagrange multiplier ψ′),

and the Lin constraints (33) for the Lagrangian-marker coordinates α and β (with Lagrange

multipliers nβ/2 and − nα/2, respectively).

IV. SUMMARY

We have presented two variational formulations for the relativistic cold laser-plasma equa-

tions, which depend on whether all the dynamical ﬁelds are varied independently or not.

We note that variational formulations in the physics literature are either presented in the

Euler-Lagrange form or the Euler-Poincar´e form (generally not both) and that the work

presented here shows the explicit connection (50) between the two variational formulations

for an important set of plasma-ﬂuid equations.

14

In deriving the energy-momentum conservation laws for the relativistic cold laser-plasma

equations, we showed that, although the form of the Noether equation depends on the

variational formulation used, i.e., either the Euler-Lagrange form (40) or the Euler-Poincar´e

form (45), the same conservation equations (25) and (29) are obtained.

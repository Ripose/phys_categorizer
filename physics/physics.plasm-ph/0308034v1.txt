RICCI, LAPENTA, AND BRACKBILL: MAGNETOTAIL PLASMA SHEET STRUCTURE

Abstract.

We use the results of a three-dimensional kinetic simulation of an Harris

current sheet to propose an explanation and to reproduce the ISEE-1/2, Geo-

tail, and Cluster observations of the magnetotail current sheet structure. Cur-

rent sheet ﬂapping, current density bifurcation, and reconnection are explained

as the results of the kink and tearing instabilities, which dominate the cur-

rent sheet evolution.

1. Introduction

The magnetotail current sheet is one of the key topics in magnetospheric physics. A

useful but simple one-dimensional description of the current sheet is given by the Harris

model, where the magnetic ﬁeld is given by Bx(z) = B0 tanh(z/λ) and the plasma density,

proportional to the current density, is given by n(z) = n0 cosh

−2(z/λ), where λ is the half

thickness of the current sheet and the GSM coordinates are used.

Observations of the current sheet have revealed a more complex structure. At the end

of April 2, 1978, the ISEE-1/2 spacecraft detected a ﬂapping of the plasma sheet and the

spacecraft crossed the central region more than 10 times in a hour. In particular, during

a ”turbulent” crossing, the spacecraft detected current concentration outside the central

region, unlike the Harris current sheet [Sergeev et al., 1993]. In fact, Geotail [Kokobun et

al., 1994; Mukai et al., 1994] averaged data obtained from October 1993 to June 1995 show

that the the structure of the plasma sheet can be often approximated by a double-peaked

electric current sheet [Hoshino et al., 1996] and observations made by the same spacecraft

during a substorm on 23 April 1996 substorm lead to similar conclusion [Asano et al.,

2003]. On January 14, 1994, Geotail also detected multiple double-peaked current sheet

crossings, associated with plasma ﬂow [Hoshino et al., 1996]. More recently, time analysis

of data from the four Cluster spacecrafts [Balogh et al., 2001] showed that fast motion and

bifurcation of the current sheet are associated with a wave-like transient propagating in

the dawn-to-dusk direction [Sergeev et al., 2003; Runov et al., 2003]. These observations

refer both to the distant magnetotail (≈ 100RE) [Hoshino et al., 1996] and to a region

closer to Earth (≈ 15RE) [Sergeev et al., 1993; Asano et al., 2003; Runov et al., 2003;

Sergeev et al., 2003]

Generalizations of the current sheet equilibria have been recently proposed to reproduce

the features observed by satellites [Shindler and Birn, 2002; Sitnov et al., 2003]. Runov

et al.

[2003] propose that these signatures are due to a kink or a sausage instability of

a current sheet with an enhanced current density on both hemispheres. Zelenyi et al.

[2002] show that non-adiabatic eﬀects can reduce the current density in the center of the

current sheet. A bifurcated current sheet can be present in the plasma outﬂow region

when magnetic reconnection is occurring [e.g., Arzner and Sholer, 2001]. Karimabadi et

al.

[2003a, 2003b] argue that the ion-ion kink instability causes a displacement of the

current sheet which can explain the observations. They show that the observed ﬂapping

wavelength quantitatively agrees with the linear theory of the ion-ion kink instability.

Their hybrid and kinetic simulations conﬁrm the evolution of the kink mode and explain

the bifurcated structure of the current sheet as a magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle with weak central

gradient.

In the present work, we use the results of a three-dimensional kinetic simulation of

the Harris current sheet to show that a kink instability and the self-consistent evolution

of the current, including reconnection, can be responsible for the data described in the

references above.

In particular, taking into account the relative motion of the current

sheet and the spacecraft, and the Cluster tetrahedron conﬁguration, we recover the most

signiﬁcant magnetic data records obtained by the Cluster spacecraft. The data can be

interpreted as the signature of current sheet ﬂapping and bifurcation. The magnetic ﬁeld

Bx and the current density Jy are spatially averaged to allow comparison with results by

Hoshino et al.

[1996]. We also compare the plasma ﬂow due to the tearing instability

with the observations [Hoshino et al., 1996; Øieroset et al., 2001; Asano et al., 2003].

2. Three-dimensional simulations

In our study, we use the implicit PIC code CELESTE3D [Forslund and Brackbill, 1985;

Vu and Brackbill, 1992; Ricci et al., 2002a], which is particularly suitable for large scale

and long period kinetic simulations performed with high mass ratio and has been ap-

plied previously to problems in magnetospheric physics [e.g., Lapenta and Brackbill, 2000;

Lapenta and Brackbill, 2002; Ricci et al., 2002b; Lapenta et al., 2003]. We use the same

plasma parameters as the GEM challenge [Birn et al., 2001], in particular λ = 0.5c/ωpi,

Ti/Te = 5, the ion drift velocity is Vi0 = 1.67VA, and we add a background population,

so that n(z) = n0 cosh

−2(z/λ) + nb, with nb = 0.2n0. Unlike the GEM challenge, we do

not add any initial perturbation and let the system evolve on its own. The dimensions

of the system are [−Lx/2, Lx/2] × [−Ly/2, Ly/2] × [−Lz/2, Lz/2] with Lx = 12.8c/ωpi,

Ly = 19.2c/ωpi, and Lz = 6.4c/ωpi. The mass ratio is mi/me = 180. The parameters

chosen make the current sheet particularly unstable and its dynamics are accelerated com-

pared with typical magnetotail current sheets. We are constrained to do that in order to

follow the dynamics of the current sheet in a reasonable computational time. As a con-

sequence, it is necessary to scale our results to make a quantitative comparison between

simulation results and observations. In any case, the general trends can be located and

the linear theory [Karimabadi et al., 2003a] can help in scaling the results.

Previous simulations [Lapenta and Brackbill, 2002; Lapenta et al., 2003; Daughton, 2003]

performed in the current aligned plane show, in absence of a plasma background, the de-

velopment of the fastest lower-hybrid drift instability on the electron gyroscale, followed

by electromagnetic modes with wavelengths intermediate between the ion and the elec-

tron gyroscale. The lower hybrid drift instability causes a velocity shear (present since

the beginning of the simulation when a background plasma is present) that triggers a

Kelvin-Helmhotz instability that kinks the current sheet. Three-dimensional simulations

have shown that the kinking of the current sheet triggers a tearing instability [Lapenta

and Brackbill, 2001; Lapenta et al., 2003]. As we add a background population, following

Karimabadi et al. [2003b], the velocity shear is present since the beginning of the simu-

lation and the resulting Kelvin-Helmhotz instability can be also interpreted as a kinetic

ion-ion kink instability [Karimabadi et al., 2003a; Karimabadi et al., 2003b].

Figure 1 shows fully developed current sheet kinking. The Bx ﬁeld and the current

density Jy are shown. The wavelength is kyλ ≈ 0.5, which matches fairly well the observed

wavelength in Runov et al.

[2003] (kyλ = 0.7) . The linear theory, predicts a decrease

of the wavelength when ρi/λ increases [Karimabadi et al., 2003a]. The amplitude A at

time tωci = 16 is A/λ ≈ 2 is comparable to the observed value (A/λ ≈ 1.4) [Sergeev et

al., 2003]. The ﬂapping motion observed by Cluster moving duskward at vph ≈ 200 km/s,

corresponding to approximatively 0.2vA. The kink instability shown in our simulations

gives a vph,SIM ≈ 0.5vA, larger than observed in space. However, the linear theory predicts

a decrease of the phase velocity when ρi/λ increases. Since, we use an artiﬁcially high

ρi/λ, the higher phase speed is justiﬁed and consistent with our interpretation of the

tion on the simulation.

3. Current sheet ﬂapping

When vertical oscillations of the plasma sheet (ﬂapping) occur, spacecrafts may repeat-

edly cross the current sheet. Clear evidence of current sheet ﬂapping is shown by ISEE-1/2

[Sergeev et al., 1996], by Geotail [Hoshino et al., 1996], and by Cluster [Runov et al., 2003;

Sergeev et al., 2003]. We focus our attention on the observations by Cluster and show

that current sheet kinking developed in the course of our simulations can explain those.

In Fig. 2a we show Cluster #2 and #3 observations taken on 29 August 2001, which

have been analyzed previously by Runov et al.

[2003].

In particular, the Bx data is

considered. In Fig. 3a, we evaluate the magnetic ﬁeld as a function of time as would be

recorded by a virtual spacecraft placed in the environment provided by the simulation.

According to the real spacecraft disposition, we impose a distance between the two virtual

satellites in the z direction to be of the order of λ/2. Cluster observes an oscillation

period of τ = 90s and a relative velocity between satellite and plasma vph ≈ 0.2vA. In

order to decrease the time necessary for the observation, we increase the relative satellite

velocity up to vSIM = 5vA, thus decreasing the oscillation period to τSIM = 2ω

−1
ci , in good

agreement with the oscillation period recorded by Cluster. With the new relative velocity

and using the fact that ωci ≈ 0.6s−1 in the magnetotail and the observed period is of

the order 54ω−1

ci , the observed wavelength, vphτ ≈ 11c/ωpi and the simulated wavelength,

vSIM τSIM ≈ 10c/ωpi, are comparable.

The ﬂapping observation recorded by Cluster #3 on September 26, 2001 and described

by Sergeev et al. [2003] is shown in Fig. 2b. It is reproduced by our simulations at later

times, when the amplitude of the kink has grown enough that the virtual satellite can

pass from one side to the other of the current sheet. This is shown in Fig. 3b. We note

that Cluster observations reveal a ﬂattening of the current sheet in the vicinity of the

points where Bx = 0. This may be the result of higher frequency kink modes, which have

been shown in more detailed explicit two-dimensional simulations [Daugthon, 2003].

8

RICCI, LAPENTA, AND BRACKBILL: MAGNETOTAIL PLASMA SHEET STRUCTURE

In agreement with Sergeev et al. [2003] and Runov et al. [2003], our simulations reveal

that the current sheet ﬂapping is mostly in the (y, z) plane, while the tilt in the (x, z)

plane is insigniﬁcant.

4. Current sheet bifurcation

Experimental evidence exists that the current distribution in the magnetotail sheet may

be double-peaked, with a pair of electric current sheets separated by a layer of a weak

quasi-uniform magnetic ﬁeld. Current sheet bifurcation has been revealed both in single

sheet crossings, and in averages over a number of current sheet crossings. For example,

Runov et al.

[2003] compare the observations of two Cluster satellites and show that

∂Bx/∂z ≈ 0 when Bx ≈ 0. (This is unlike the Harris sheet equilibrium, where ∂Bx/∂z is

maximum at z = 0 where Bx = 0.) Statistical studies of the current sheet are presented

in Hoshino et al.

[1996], revealing a bifurcated current proﬁle. The bifurcated current

proﬁle is also reﬂected in the distribution of the values of the Bx ﬁeld, as the number of

observations of small guide ﬁelds is greater than what expected in the case of a Harris

sheet equilibrium [Hoshino et al., 1996; Sergeev et al., 2003], and in the change of the

∂Bx/∂z proﬁle, as a function of Bx as the peak is shifted from the center of the current

sheet to the region where Bx ≈ 0.5B0.

Figure 1 shows that the kink instability produces a self-consistent change in the current

density. This change can explain the satellite observations, both single crossing and

averaged signatures.

A single crossing signature is shown in Fig. 2c from 29 August 2001 observations of

Cluster #3 and #4 considered by Runov et al. [2003]. Conversely to the case of standard

Harris sheet, near the point where Bx ≈ 0 the magnetic ﬁelds measured by the two

satellites are equal, even though the distance between the satellites is of the order of

the current sheet thickness. This indicates that the current proﬁle is not peaked at the

center of the sheet. In Fig. 3c, we show that similar observations are found within our

simulation. The distance between the two virtual satellites is also of the order of λ.

An average over x and y of the current density Jy and the ∂Bx/∂z proﬁles are shown

in Fig. 4 at t = 0 and tωci = 20. Assuming that the spatially averaged current proﬁles

can be compared with the averaged observations of many current sheet crossings, we show

that the proﬁles at tωci = 20 agree remarkably with the results of the Geotail observations

which have been averaged by Hoshino et al. [1996]. The current is depleted at the center

of the current sheet and two current peaks grow on the ﬂanks of the initial current sheet.

Furthermore, ∂Bx/∂z is no longer peaked at the center of the current sheet. Instead, it is

rather ﬂat (this kind of measure is generally very noisy) and slightly peaked at Bx ≈ 0.5.

We ﬁnally remark that observations by Geotail on 23 April 1996 show that positive

d|Bx|/dt corresponds to relevant current density Jy [Asano et al., 2003]; the same eﬀect

is also recovered within our simulation.

5. Reconnection

Not only does a kink instability grow, but also a tearing instability develops in the

Harris sheet, which leads to the reconnection of the magnetic ﬁeld lines and outﬂow and

inﬂow plasma jets. Satellite observations typically reveal the reconnection process either

by detecting inﬂow and outﬂow plasma jets, which can be very noisy [e.g., Asano et al.,

2003], or by detecting earthward and tailward plasma jets with velocities of the order

of 0.1vA or bigger [Hoshino et al., 1996], or even by detecting ﬂow reversal [Øieroset et

al., 2001].

In Fig. 5 we show signatures of magnetic reconnection by showing a ﬂow

D R A F T

D R A F T

10

reversal associated with a change in the sign of the reconnecting ﬁeld. The earthward and

tailward velocities, detected during the crossing of the current sheet, are of the order of

0.1vA, which roughly corresponds to the typical order of magnitude of plasma velocity in

the satellite observations.

6. Conclusion

We remark that the kink instability developed here is due to the velocity shear caused by

the presence of a background population, as shown by Karimabadi et al. [2003a, 2003b].

If there is no background density, the kink can grow because of the nonlinear development

of the Lower Hybrid Drift Instability that modiﬁes the velocity proﬁle and causes a shear

in the velocity [Lapenta and Brackbill, 2002].

We have chosen to start from a relatively thin and unstable current sheet (λ/di =

0.5). Such thin current sheets are indeed observed in the magnetotail [e.g., Asano et al.,

2003, for a review]. It is possible that for thicker current sheets the tearing instability is

stabilized by the presence of a Bz ﬁeld, while the kinking is unstable.

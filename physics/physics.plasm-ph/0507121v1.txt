Abstract

In this letter we investigate how the complex rotation and quivering
motion of an elongated polarized dust grain in the presence of a monochro-
matic electromagnetic wave can originate dipolar emission with two dis-
tinct spectral components.

We present a model for the emission of radiation by elongated polar-
ized dust grains under the inﬂuence of both an external electromagnetic
wave and a constant background magnetic ﬁeld. The dust, exhibiting ro-
tational motion at the external electromagnetic ﬁeld frequency ω0 as well
as quivering motion at frequency Ω0, proportional to the em ﬁeld ampli-
tude, will radiate with frequencies that will depend on the external ﬁeld
wavelength and amplitude.

The radiated spectra exibits a frequency around ω0, and sidebands at
ω0 ± Ω0 and ω0 ± 2Ω0. Since the amplitude and the frequency of the
background electromagnetic ﬁeld are independent parameters, this model
establishes a correlation between diﬀerent spectral components of galactic
dipolar emission, which may help to explain the correlation between a
component of the Galactic microwave emission and the 100µm thermal
emission from interstellar dust, that has been recently measured.

1 Introduction

Observations on cosmic background radiation have demonstrated the existence
of a correlation between a component of the Galactic microwave emission and
the 100 µm thermal emission from interstellar dust, and several models have

1

been proposed to justify the results measured. Leitcht et al. [1] suggested free-
free emission from heated gas to be the cause for this correlation but the model
could not account for the expected Hα emission unless the temperature would
be in excess of 106K, as occurs in shock-heated gas from a supernova remnant.
Drain and Lazarain showed that for the free-free emission mechanism to be able
to explain the observed microwave excess it would require an energy input of
at least two orders of magnitude larger than that provided by supernovae and
proposed an alternative mechanism to explain the excess of microwave radiation
observed, based on electric dipole emission from rotating dust grains [2], which
has been able to account for many aspects of the experimental measurements.

More recently, data received from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP), has lead to the claim that the model proposed by Drain and Lazarain
could only account for 5% of the Galactic microwave emission, and, once again
rekindled the debate about the origin of ”anomalous” dust correlated microwave
emission [3]. Also, Lazarain and Prunet [4] have analyzed the importance of the
thermal emission of magnetized dust, locally aligned by the Galactic magnetic
ﬁeld in the context of CMB contamination by Galactic dust emission, while
Ponthieu [5] and others [6] have stressed the importance of the polarization
eﬀects by measuring a 3-5% polarized dust signal on the Galactic plane.

In parallel, several studies of levitation and dynamics of charged dust grains
have been carried out in both space and laboratory environments [8], to inves-
tigate the motion of charged dust particles in low temperature dusty plasmas
discharges[9] and it has been observed that in a dust plasma sheath dust grains
levitate due to a balance between gravitational and electrostatic forces, present-
ing a bouncing motion between electrodes and a quivering motion across the
electric ﬁeld of the sheath.

Several processes have, since then, been proposed to explain dust dynamics,
with special emphasis on rotational excitation and damping of the dust grains,
which, in both astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, are known to possess a
rather elongated shape [10][11] exhibiting a non-zero dipole moment. Examples
include recoil from thermal collisions and/or evaporation [12], collisions with
gas atoms or plasma and plasma drag [13], absorption and emission of radiation
[14][15], random H2 formation [12], [16] and systematic torques [17] [12]. How-
ever, the inﬂuence of interstellar electromagnetic background radiation on dust
dynamics has not yet, to our knowledge, been fully addressed.

Tskhaya and Shukla [18] have proposed a simple analytical model to describe
the dynamics of elongated dust grains in the presence of circularly polarized elec-
tromagnetic waves and have concluded that the grains not only rotate - or spin
- with the frequency of electromagnetic ﬁelds but also exhibits a complex quiv-
ering motion. Radiative processes from such spinning dusts have not, however,
been included in the model.

This paper addresses the emission of radiation from a single rotating or
spinning dust grain under the inﬂuence of an external electromagnetic (em)
wave and a constant background magnetic ﬁeld, correlating the external em
ﬁeld amplitude as well as it wavelength with the dust-emitted frequency spectra
and predicting the radiated power due to both rotation and quivering motions

of the dust grain. The work presented is organized as follows: starting from the
same grain equations of motion as derived in [18] in Section 2, we address the
emission of dipolar radiation from spinning dust in Section 3, show the results
of numerical simulations of the emission spectrum of dust grains in section 4
and present the conclusions in Section 5.

2 Spinning dust dynamics

We start by considering the propagation along the z direction of a circularly
polarized electromagnetic (em) beam in a medium composed by neutral elon-
gated dust grains, such as a stellar dust cloud, in the presence of a constant
background magnetic ﬁeld

−→
B = (0, 0, B0).

The electric ﬁeld can be written as:

−→
E (−→r , t) = E0 exp(i

−→
k .−→r )−→e (t),

(1)
where E0 is the electric ﬁeld amplitude and −→e (t) = (cos(ω0t), sin(ω0t), 0) is the
polarization unit vector.

We will assume that the dust magnetic moment of each grain is along the
direction of the background magnetic ﬁeld (z) and neglect the precession motion
around this axis, meaning that the dust will rotate in the xy plane. The dipole
−→
d = d(cos φ, sin φ, 0) with φ the orientation
moment of the grain is expressed as
of the grain relative to the x direction.

The equation of motion describing the rotation of the grain will be [18]:

which can be written as:

Iz

d2φ
dt2 = −dE0 sin(φ − ω0t),

d2φ
dt2 = −Ω2

0 sin(φ − ω0t),

where Ω2
of the dust grain.

0 = dE0/Iz and Iz is the z component of the principal moment of inertia

Under the inﬂuence of the electromagnetic wave E0, the grain will rotate with
the same angular frequency, ω0 [18], [19], [20]. Besides this spinning motion,
the grain may also exhibit a quivering motion corresponding to ﬂuctuations
on the mean spinning motion. It is therefore convenient to write the angle of
orientation of the grain as φ = ω0t + δφ, which is equivalent to considering
the quivering motion of the grain in a reference frame which rotates with the
polarization of the ﬁeld E0. The equation of motion then becomes:

As demonstrated in reference [18], equation (4) can be integrated and, im-

posing the initial conditions:

The constant of integration ε plays the role of an eﬀective energy and for
values in the range [ −1, 1] the variation of δφ is bounded, resulting in a quivering
motion of the grain with a frequency roughly equal to Ω0 [18].

In this paper we are interested in situations when ε ≃ −1 and the quivering

motion of the grain is approximately harmonic:

δφ(t) ≃ δφ0 cos(Ω0t) +

sin(Ω0t)

In the original frame of reference, the dust grains rotate with an angular

velocity given by ω = ω0 +
δφ, thus exhibiting a rotation motion with the
frequency of the external em ﬁeld ω0, and a quivering motion across the direction
of the electric ﬁeld with a frequency Ω0, proportional to the external em ﬁeld
amplitude. The quivering motion can be identiﬁed as the ﬂuctuations of the
mean rotation motion.

3 Radiation from spinning dusts

As the grain rotates about the z axis, the grain emits electromagnetic radiation
according to the following equation [21]:

Since the CMB has a low intensity we will investigate the case of weak
ﬁeld amplitude, corresponding to a small quivering frequencies and Ω0 << ω0,
then the dust-radiated electric ﬁeld can be separated into three sets of spectral
lines around ω0. The ﬁrst corresponds to the emission of the standard dipolar
radiation with frequency ω0 (remember that −→ut and −→ur rotate approximately
with frequency ω0) associated with the rotational motion of the grain:

The second set of spectral lines is associated with the quivering motion,
resulting in a spectral broadening of the standard dipole radiation with the
generation of two sidebands with frequencies ω0 + Ω0 (anti-Stokes) and ω0 − Ω0

ﬁeld.

The angular emission distribution is represented in Figure 1, showing that
the emission is larger along the direction of the background magnetic ﬁeld and
null along the plane of rotation of the grain, which indicates that each dust grain
behaves as a small probe sensing the local electromagnetic environment - both
the frequency and intensity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld as well as the direction
of the background magnetic ﬁeld - and imprinting them in the emitted dipolar
radiation.

4 Simulation

The analysis of the dynamics of a single dust grain presented in the previous
section has provided much insight about the dipolar emission spectrum in a dust
cloud, enabling the identiﬁcation of two regimes (for Ω0 >> ω0 and Ω0 << ω0),
as well as the dominant frequencies of the emitted spectrum. A more real model
can devised by averaging the emission spectrum over an ensemble of identical
grains with the quivering temperature T :

I(ω) =

dε n(ε) hI(ω, ε)i ,

(30)

[−1,1]
R

(cid:2)

0/2KBT

−(ε + 1)IΩ2

where hI(ω, ε)i is the Gibbs average of the emission spectrum over the ensemble,
n(ε) ≃ n0 exp
the Boltzmann distribution for the proba-
bilities of occupancy of the rotational energies in the large angular momentum
limit [22] (notice that the quivering angular momentum of the grain is εIΩ0)
and KB the Boltzmann constant. Since the grains are quasi-periodic systems,
the Gibbs average hI(ω, ε)i in equation (30) can be replaced by a time sam-
pling according to the Ergodic hypothesis, which states that the evolution of a
complex classical dynamical system takes it, with equal probability, through all
states which are accessible from the starting point subject to the constrain of
energy conservation [23][24].

(cid:3)

The emission spectrum of each dust grain has been simulated using a simple
fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator to numerically solve the following equation:

(31)

d2δφ
dτ 2 = − sin(δφ),
with τ = Ω0t is the natural time scale of the process. To sample over diﬀer-
ent energy conﬁgurations, a method based on the Metropolis algorithm [24],
has been used, in which a random conﬁguration of initial conditions is gener-
ated and the eﬀective energy ε is calculated. Should the energy change relative
to the previous conﬁguration ε′ be negative, the new conﬁguration is auto-
matically accepted, else, the new conﬁguration is accepted with probability
exp

(ε − ε′)IΩ2
Simulation results are shown in Figure 2 for both regimes, in which the
(cid:2)
quivering motion is assumed to be in equilibrium with the background at tem-
perature T = 3K. Also, a cutoﬀ of the eﬀective energy at ε = 0.5 has been
imposed, in order to maintain the results close to the domain of validity of the
model. The emission pertaining to each single grain is shown in grey (which can
be interpreted as the sampling ﬂuctuations) and the mean radiated spectrum
in black. In both regimes the thermal sampling leads to the expected broaden-
ing of all the emission spectral picks, though it is still possible to identify the
predicted features.

Since all nonlinear terms of equation (4) have been included in the sim-
ulations, it is possible to detect the signature, though weak, of higher order
sidebands in the ﬂuctuation spectrum (grey lines) at 3ω0, 4ω0...
for the low-
intensity regime, corresponding to nonlinear wave mixing of the external em
wave through the coupling with the grain.

5 Conclusions

In summary, we have presented a model for the emission of radiation by elon-
gated polarized dust grains under the inﬂuence of both an external electro-
magnetic (em) wave and a constant background magnetic ﬁeld. The emission
spectrum depends on the wavelength of the external em wave but - and most
importantly - also on the amplitude, or intensity, of the external em ﬁeld, which
is, in fact, the parameter that determines the frequencies of much of the com-
ponents of the emitted radiation.

The emission spectrum of the grain exhibits a spectral line centered at the
external em ﬁeld wavelength, or frequency, ω0, and Raman-like sidebands at
ω0 ± Ω0 and ω0 ± 2Ω0. We have also identiﬁed that the optimum direction of
emission to be parallel to the background magnetic ﬁeld, rendering dust grains
exceptionally useful for local probing of magnetic ﬁelds near far astrophysical
objects.

Numerical simulations indicate that, as expected, thermal averaging of the
spectrum, and the inclusion of the nonlinear dust dynamics can lead to the
broadening and smoothing of the emitted spectrum.

Since the amplitude and the frequency of the background em ﬁeld are inde-
pendent parameters, this model allows to predict a correlation between diﬀerent
spectral components of galactic dipolar emission, which may explain the cor-
relation between a component of the Galactic microwave emission and the 100
µm thermal emission from interstellar dust.

Within generalized linear response theory, an expression for the dielectric function is derived
which is consistent with standard approaches to the electrical dc conductivity. Explicit results are
given for the ﬁrst moment Born approximation. Some exact relations as well as the limiting be-
haviour at small values of the wave number and frequency are investigated.

I. INTRODUCTION

The dielectric function ǫ(~k, ω) describing the response of a charged particle system to an external, time and space
dependent electrical ﬁeld is related to various phenomena such as electrical conductivity and optical absorption of
light. In particular, it is an important quantity for plasma diagnostics, see, e.g., recent applications to determine the
parameters of picosecond laser produced high-density plasmas [1]. However, the application of widely used simpliﬁed
expressions for the dielectric function is questionable in the case of nonideal plasmas.

As well known, the electrical dc conductivity of a charged particle system should be obtained as a limiting case of the
dielectric function. However, at present both quantities are treated by diﬀerent theories. A standard approach to the
dc electrical conductivity is given by the Chapman-Enskog approach [2]. In dense plasmas, where many-particle eﬀects
are of importance, linear response theory has been worked out to relate the conductivity to equilibrium correlation
functions which can be evaluated using the method of thermodynamic Green functions, see [3]. This way it is possible
to derive results for the conductivity of partially ionized plasmas not only on the level of ordinary kinetic theory, but
to include two-particle nonequilibrium correlations as well [4].

On the other hand, the dielectric function can also be expressed in terms of equilibrium correlation functions, but
the systematic perturbative treatment to include collision eﬀects is diﬃcult near the point ~k = 0, ω = 0, because
an essential singularity arises in zeroth order. Diﬀerent possibilities are known to go beyond the well-known RPA
result. In the static limit, local ﬁeld corrections have been discussed extensively [5], and the dynamical behavior of
the corrections to the RPA in the long-wavelength limit was investigated in the time-dependent mean ﬁeld theory
neglecting damping eﬀects [6], see also [7] for the strong coupling case. At arbitrary ~k, ω, approximations are made
on the basis of sum rules for the lowest moments [8]. However, these approximations cannot give an unambiguous
expression for ǫ(~k, ω) in the entire ~k, ω space.

We will give here a uniﬁed approach to the dielectric function as well as the dc conductivity, which is consistent
with the Chapman-Enskog approach to the dc conductivity and which allows for a perturbation expansion also in
the region of small ~k, ω. In the following Section II the method of generalized linear response [9] is presented which
allows to ﬁnd very general relations between a dissipative quantity and correlation functions describing the dynamical
behaviour of ﬂuctuations in equilibrium. A special expression for the dielectric function is given in Section III which
is related to the use of the force-force correlation function in evaluating the conductivity.

Diﬀerent methods can be applied to evaluate equilibrium correlation functions for nonideal plasmas. We will use
perturbation theory to evaluate thermodynamic Green functions [10]. Results in Born approximation are given in
Section IV. Using diagram techniques, partial summations can be performed as shown in Ref. [3]. An alternative to
evaluate equilibrium correlation function in strongly coupled plasmas is given by molecular dynamical simulations. It
is expected that reliable results for the dielectric function for dense systems by quantum molecular dynamics will be
available in the near future. Works in this direction are in progress but will not be discussed in this paper.

To illustrate the general approach, explicit results for the dielectric function in lowest moment Born approximation
are given for a Hydrogen plasma in Section V. A sum rule as well as the conductivity are discussed. The simple
approximation considered here will be improved in a subsequent paper [11], where a four-moment approach to the
two-component plasma is investigated.

We consider a charge-neutral plasma consisting of two components with masses mc and charges ec, where the index c

The main problem in evaluating the mean value of the current density

t, Eq. (10), is the determination of ρ(t). In
linear response theory where the external potential is considered to be weak, the statistical operator ρ(t) can be found
as shown in Appendix A. An important ingredient is that a set of relevant observables
can be introduced whose
t characterize the nonequilibrium state of the system. The non-equilibrium statistical operator is
mean values
constructed using a corresponding set of thermodynamic parameters φn(t). For weak perturbations, in linear response
theory it is assumed that the φn(t) are linear with respect to the external potential, and a set of generalized response
equations is derived which allow to evaluate the response parameters φn(t). The coeﬃcients of these response equations
are given in terms of equilibrium correlation functions which can be evaluated using the methods of quantum statistics.
Solving this set of linear response equations by using Cramers rule, the response parameters can be eliminated. If

The correlation functions can be evaluated by standard many particle methods such as perturbation theory for
thermodynamic Green functions. In this context the correlation functions containing ˆJk are obtained from irreducible
diagrams to Green functions containing Jk, which do not disintegrate cutting only one interaction line.
The expression (11) for the polarization function is very general. Depending on the set of observables

, diﬀerent
special cases are possible such as the Kubo formula or the Boltzmann equation to be discussed in the following section.
It is also possible to include two-particle nonequilibrium correlations [3,4] if an appropriate set of Bn is chosen. We
will work out here an approach to the dielectric function which is closely related to the Chapman-Enskog approach
to the electrical conductivity.

III. MOMENT EXPANSION OF THE POLARIZATION FUNCTION

Up to now, Bn was not speciﬁed. It is an advantage of the approach given here that diﬀerent levels of approximations
can be constructed, depending on the use of diﬀerent sets of Bn. If no ﬁnite order perturbation expansion of the
correlation functions is performed in evaluating the polarization function (11), all these diﬀerent approaches are exact
and should give identical results. However, evaluating the correlation functions within perturbation theory, diﬀerent
results for the polarization function are expected using diﬀerent sets of Bn. As has been shown for the electrical
conductivity [3,4], results from ﬁnite order perturbation theory are the better the more relevant observables are
considered.

A simple example for a relevant observable Bn characterizing the nonequilibrium state of the system is the current

density (10),

3

During this paper, we will treat this approach in detail. The current density is related to the lowest moment of the
distribution function. Possible extensions to more general sets of relevant observables are discussed at the end of this
section.

In the approach given by Eq. (15), we have

which is also denoted as the Kubo formula for the polarization function. Similarly, the Kubo formula can also be
obtained from more general sets of observables
. A direct derivation of the Kubo formula is obtained from
Appendix A, Eq. (62), if the set of relevant observables Bn is empty. Diﬀerent approaches based on diﬀerent sets of
relevant observables Bn are formally equivalent as long as no approximations in evaluating the correlation functions
are performed.

However, expressions (16 ) and (20 ) are diﬀerently suited to perform perturbation expansions. For this we consider

the static conductivity σ = σ(0, 0) which follows from

diverging. In contrast, (23) allows for a perturbative expansion. For instance, in Born approximation the Faber –
˙J0; ˙J0iiη is also known as the force–
Ziman result for the electrical conductivity is obtained. The expression σ−1
force correlation function expression for the resistivity. More precisely, the resistivity should be given in terms of
stochastic forces which are related to the second term in the denominator of Eq. (23), see also Eq. (58) in App. A.
The applicability of correlation functions for the inverse transport coeﬃcients has been widely discussed [9].

The approach to the dielectric function given in the present paper is based on the choice (15) for the set of relevant
observables and may be considered as the generalization of the force–force correlation function method for the electrical
resistivity to the dielectric function. Possible extensions of the set of relevant observables have been investigated in
evaluating the dc conductivity in Ref. [3] and will be considered in evaluating the dielectric function in a forthcoming
paper [11].

IV. EVALUATION OF CORRELATION FUNCTIONS

Within the generalized linear response approach, the polarization function is given in terms of correlation functions
which, in general, are elements of matrices. Within a quantum statistical approach, the correlation functions are
related to Green functions which can be evaluated by diagram techniques. This has been discussed in detail in the
case of the static electrical conductivity [3] and will not be detailed here. Instead, we will consider only the lowest
orders of perturbation theory (Born approximation).

In the case considered here, the relevant observable Jk (10) is given by a single particle observable. The correlation

will use Rydberg units so that T = 3.68 in Ryd and ne = 0.0474 in a−3

First we discuss the dependence of the dielectric function on frequency for diﬀerent values of k, see Figs. 1-4. For
large values of k our result for the dielectric function coincides with the RPA result. At decreasing k strong deviations
are observed. Both the RPA expression as well as the expression (29) for the dielectric function fulﬁll important
relations such as the Kramers-Kronig relation and the condition of total screening. The validity of the sum rule

In this paper we have focussed the discussion only to the properties of ǫ(k, ω). Related quantities such as ǫ−1(k, ω)
will be investigated in a forthcoming paper [11]. The parameter values for density and temperature can be extended
to other nondegenerate plasmas like ordinary laboratory plasmas or the solar plasma. This has been done with results
showing the same qualitative behavior of the expression (29) in comparison with the RPA expression, but at shifted
values of k and ω.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

An expression for the dielectric function of Coulomb systems is derived which is consistent with the Chapman-
Enskog approach to the dc conductivity. For a two-component plasma, explicit calculations have been performed in
the lowest moment approach. In Born approximation, expressions are given which allow the determination of ǫ(k, ω)
in an analytical way. It is shown that general relations such as sum rules are fulﬁlled as well as the dc conductivity
is obtained in the form of the Ziman-Faber result.

We performed exploratory calculations to illustrate how the generalized linear response approach works. Obviously
an improvement of the results can be obtained if i) the Born approximation is improved including higher order of
perturbation theory, ii) higher moments of the single-particle distribution are taken into account. Both points have
been discussed for the limiting case of the dc conductivity [3], where a virial expansion of the inverse conductivity
was given.

A four moment approach will be presented in a subsequent paper [11] where also the comparison with the Kubo
approach and computer simulations are discussed. Within the approach given here it is also possible to treat the
degenerate case. Work in this direction is in progress.

The relevant statistical operator (38) does not solve the von Neumann equation, but it can serve to formulate the
correct boundary conditions to obtain the retarded solution of the von Neumann equation. Using Abel’s theorem,
the nonequilibrium statistical operator [9] is found with the help of the time evolution operator U (t, t′),

is obtained.

After we have considered the collisionless plasma, we will now treat the general case of an interacting system
where the correlation functions have to be evaluated with the full Hamiltonian (1). The evaluation of equilibrium
correlation functions for an interacting many-fermion system can be performed within perturbation theory such as a
Green function approach, and many-particle eﬀects can be treated in a systematic way. We will give here the lowest
order contribution with respect to the screened Coulomb interaction (Born approximation), a systematic treatment
of higher orders can be done as indicated in [3] for the case of static conductivity.

In the numerator of (16), the higher order expansion for (Jk; Jk) lead to the replacement of the occupation numbers
f c
p for the free fermion gas by the occupation numbers in an interacting fermion gas. This corrections in Born
approximation can be given as shift of the single-particle energies and can be replaced by a shift of the chemical
potential.

We will investigate here the collision terms where the Born approximation leads to essential contributions. For this

we use the relations (proof by partial integration (57))

Abstract

This paper oﬀers a model for incoherent scatter signal spectra with-
out averaging the received signal over sounding runs (realizations). The
model is based on the existent theory of radio waves single scattering from
the medium dielectric permittivity irregularities, and on the existing ki-
netic theory of the plasma thermal irregularities. The proposed model
is obtained for the case of monostatic sounding. The model shows that
the main contribution to the received signal is made by ion-acoustic waves
caused by certain spatial harmonics of the ions number phase density. The
model explains the width and form of the signal spectrum by macroscopic
characteristics of the medium, and its ﬁne ’peaked’ structure by character-
istics of the ions number phase density. The notion of the weight volume
is introduced to deﬁne the domain of wave vectors and velocities in the
spatial spectrum of the ions number phase density which makes the main
contribution to the formation of the scattered signal. This weight volume
depends on the antenna pattern, the form of the sounding signal, and on
the time window of spectral processing, as well as on ionospheric plasma
macroscopic parameters: electron and ion temperatures, ion composition,
and the drift velocity. Within the context of additional assumption about
the ions number phase density, the proposed model was tested by the data
from the Irkutsk incoherent scatter radar. The test showed a good ﬁt of
the model to experiment.

1 Introduction

One of the remote probing techniques for the ionosphere is the method of radio
waves incoherent scatter. The method is based on the scattering of radio waves
from ionospheric plasma dielectric permittivity irregularities [Evans, 1969]. Fur-
thermore, two diﬀerent experimental conﬁgurations are involved: monostatic
(where the receive and transmit antennas are combined) and bistatic (where

1

these antennas are spaced). In actual practice, it is customary to use the mono-
static conﬁguration. Ionospheric plasma parameters (ion composition, drift ve-
locity, electron and ion temperatures, and electron density) in this case are
determined from the scattered signal received after completion of the radiated
pulse. The spectral power of the received signal, averaged over sounding runs
(’realizations’), is related (assuming that such an averaging is equivalent to
statistical averaging) to the mean spectral density of dielectric permittivity ir-
regularities by the radar equation [Tatarsky, 1969]. The connection of the dielec-
tric permittivity irregularities spectral density with mean statistical parameters
of the medium is usually determined in terms of kinetic theory [Clemow and
Dougherty,1969; Sheﬃeld, 1975; Kofman,1997].

The location and size of the ionospheric region that makes a contribution
to the scattered signal (sounding volume) is determined by the antenna beam
shape, the sounding radio pulse, and by the time window of spectral processing
[Suni et al., 1989]. The shape of the sounding volume determines also the
method’s spectral resolution, the accuracy to which the mean spectral density
of dielectric permittivity is determined (which, in turn, aﬀects the determination
accuracy of macroscopic ionospheric parameters: electron and ion temperatures,
the drift velocity, and electron density). The number of realizations, over which
the received signal spectral power is averaged, determines the method’s time
resolution, i.e. its ability to keep track (based on measurements) of fast changes
of macroscopic parameters of ionospheric plasma.

Currently most incoherent scatter radars have accumulated extensive sets of
the scattered signal individual realizations (private communications of P.Erickson
(Millstone Hill), V.Lysenko (Kharkov IS radar), and G.Wannberg (EISCAT)).
Therefore, attempts are made to analyze the realizations from diﬀerent methods
which diﬀer from a standard averaging by their sounding runs. Basically, these
methods imply looking for small scatterers making the main contribution to
the scattered signal. This method is good for analyzing signals scattered from
meteors and their traces [Pellinen-Wannberg, 1998]; however, it is insuﬃciently
substantiated for describing the scattering in the ionosphere.

In the work there were used the experimental data obtained with Irkutsk
Incoherent Scatter radar. The radar is located at 520N, 1040E, it has sounding
frequency 152-160 MHz and peak power 3MW. High signal-to-noice ratio during
the experiments under investigation ( S/N ¿ 10 ) allows us to neglect the noice
eﬀects when analyzing the signal received.

The technique of the incoherent scatter signal processing in Irkutsk IS radar
is the following. For each single realization of received signal we calculate spec-
trum in time window with width equal to the sounding signal duration and with
delay corresponding to the radar range to the sounding volume investigated.
The sounding signal we use in this experiment is a radiopulse with duration
800 mks. The repeating frequency approximately 25 Hz. Averaging over the
1000 realizations corresponds to 3% dispersium of the overaged spectrum rela-
tive to its mathematical expectation. The reason of using such a simple pulse
is to investigate the ﬁne structure of the single (unaveraged) spectrums in this
simpliest case.

signal in an individual realization (Figure 1(b-d)) diﬀers drastically from that
averaged over realizations (Figure 1(a)); therefore, existing model of the incoher-
ently scattered signal, based on averaging over sounding runs, are inapplicable
for its interpretation. For that reason, development of new models of the scat-
tered signal for analyzing its separate realizations without averaging them is
important from the theoretical and practical standpoint.

Sometimes it is useful to suppose that incoherent scattering signal is a ran-
dom gaussian one [for example, Farley, 1969; Zhou, 1999]. But, it is well known
that the signal received is a detirministic function of ionospheric dielectric per-
mittivity ǫ and is fully determined in ﬁrst approximation by the Born’s formula
(in one or another its form [Ishimaru, 1978; Berngardt and Potekhin, 2000]), this

3

relation could be called as a radar equation for signals [Berngardt and Potekhin,
2000].

The dielectric permittivity irregularities also could be supposed as a random
functions, but they are deterministic functional of some other functions (in
case of uncollisional unmagnetized palsma with one ions type those functions
are phase density of the ions and electrons as functions of velocity, location and
time, ion composition and temperatures of the ions and electrons, this functional
dependence is determined by the Landau’s solution [Landau, 1946]).

If one could determine all these unknown functions, the received signal shape
in single realization will be fully determined, and could be analyzed without us-
ing any statistical methods. Such an approach, for example, is used in radioa-
coustical technique of the athmosphere sounding when the delectric permittivity
irregularities (by which the radisignal is scattered) are generated by the acous-
tical wave [Kalistratova and Kon, 1985].

The statistical proporties of the single realizations are showed at Figure 2.
From this ﬁgure it becomes clear that the unaveraged spectrum has the ﬁne
structure - it consists from a number of peaks with approximately 1.5KHz width
(and this width very slightly depends on frequency), which could be character-
ized by the peak amplitude(amplitude at the maximum of the peak) and peak
appearence (number of realizations in which there is a peak maximum at given
frequency) at the given frequency, and those properties distributions are not
gaussian ones but have double peaked structure and located in the same band
with incoherent scattering average spectral power.

This fact allows as to suppose that not only average spectral power of the
received signal depends on ionosperical parameters, but the ﬁne structure of
non-averaged spectra too.

At ﬁrst, it is neccessary to understand quilitatively, what information one
could obtain from one realization of the IS signal. It is well known, that af-
ter any statistical processing of a function a part of the information is loosed
irreversibly (for example. when one calucaltes the ﬁrst n statistical moments,
all the rest moments, starting with n+1 are still unknown). That is why, if
the statistical characteristics of the realizations (mean spectral power or corre-
lation function) are depend on the ion and electron temperatures and the ion
composition then single realization must depend on all those parameters and on
some new ’additional’ parameters. It is clear that to determine temperatures
and ion composition from averaged signal parameters is much easier than from
single realization (because the second one includes additional parameters), and
we can use the ones obtained from mean spectral power, with necessary spa-
tial and spectral resolution, using diﬀerent techniques, for example alternating
codes [Lehtinen, 1986]. But the new ’additional’ parameters can be determined
from single realizations only.

The aim of this paper is to ﬁnd out the functional dependence of single
realization spectrum on all the parameters, including well known (temperatures
and ion composition) and new ones, which could describe the single realizations
spectrum properties. For this propose we will use for analysis only signals with
high signal to noise ratio (more than 10), because in this case the noice eﬀects

4

could be neglected and the received signal could be supposed as only IS signal
without presence any noice.

2 Initial expressions

To analyze the individual realizations of the scattered signal, it is necessary to
have a convenient expression relating the spectrum of the scattered signal to the
space-time spectrum of dielectric permittivity irregularities without averaging
over realizations. Such an expression for a monostatic experimental conﬁgu-
ration was obtained and analyzed in [Berngardt and Potekhin, 2000]. It holds
true in the far zone of the receive-transmit antenna and, within constant factors
(unimportant for a subsequent discussion), is

large wave numbers of the sounding wave k0 > ωN /c (where ωN is plasma fre-
quency) , is proportional to the electron density irregularities spectrum [Landau

The physical meaning of the expression (3) is as follows: the position and ve-
locity of each ion at the moment T are determined by the INPD fi1(−→r , −→v ; T ),
and the dielectric permittivity irregularities
ǫ(ω, −→k ; T ) are determined by ion-
acoustic oscillations of plasma under the action of such initial conditions.

3 Traditional processing of the incoherent scat-
ter signal, and characteristics of its separate
realizations

Traditionally, the incoherent scattered signal is processed in the following way.
A set of the scattered signal spectra (1) is used to obtain its spectral power
averaged over realizations. By assuming that an averaging over the realizations
is equivalent to a statistical averaging, and also by assuming a Maxwellian
distribution of the INPD fi1(−→r , −→v ; T ), one can obtain the following expression
for the mean spectral power of the scattered signal [Suni et al.,1989]:

where F (ω) is the ’smearing’ function determined by the spectrum of the
sounder signal and the spectral processing time window; and <> is averaging
over realizations.

The frequency dependence of the scattered signal mean spectral power (7)
under usual ionospheric conditions has a typical ’two-hump’ form (Figure 1(a))
[Evans,1969]. From the scattered signal mean spectral power (7) it is possible
to determine the electron Te and ion Ti temperatures and the drift velocity
−→v 0 involved in a familiar way in the functions ǫ||(ω, 2k0), Ge(ω, 2k0) and fi0(v)
[Sheﬃeld,1975].

In single realizations, however, the scattered signal spectral power diﬀers
essentially from the mean spectral power. Figure 1 presents the scattered sig-
nalspectral power in three consecutive realizations (Figure 1(A-C)), the spectral
power averaged over 1000 realizations (Figure 1(D)), and the spectral power of
the sounder signal envelope (Figure 1(E)). From Figure 1 it is evident that the
non averaged spectral power of the incoherent scatter signal (Figure 1(A-C)) has
a typical ’peaked’ form, the width of peaks is larger than that of the sounder

4.1 Structure of one realization of the incoherent scatter

To obtain a model of the incoherent scatter signal we substitute the Landau’s
expression for dielectric permittivity irregularities (3) into the expression for the
scattered signal spectrum (2). Using in (3) the spatial spectrum
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T )
of the ions number phase density fi1(−→r , −→v ; T ), and upon interchanging the
f
order of integration, we obtain the one-realization model for the scattered signal
spectrum:

similar to the Radon transform of the function
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ). A kinetic function

e

ξ(ν, −→k ) = Ge(ν, −→k )/ǫ||(ν, −→k )

(11)

is determined by macroscopic parameters of ionospheric plasma Te,i and −→v0;
these parameters can be determined, for example, from measurements of the
mean spectral power of the received signal (7).

Thus the kernel K(ω, −→k , v||) is completely determined by the sounder signal,
the receiving window, and by macroscopic characteristics of ionospheric plasma.
The expression (8) clearly shows the meaning of the kernel K(ω, −→k , v||): it deter-
mines the selective properties of the model, i.e. the possibilities of determining
the unknown function Fi1(−→k , v||; T ) from the measured u(ω). Hence it can be
termed the weight volume in the space (−→k , v||), or ambiguity function. Since the
function H1(ω, k) is a narrow-band one, with its carrier concentrated near zero,
the function of indeﬁniteness K(ω, k, v||) has also a limited carrier in k near

dependence on the wave vector directions
k are determined by the product of
the kinetic function ξ(ω, −→k ) and the antenna beam g(

k).

b

According to the resulting model (8), the form of scattered signal single
spectrum is determined both by a determinate component (the weight volume
K(ω, k, v||)), and by a random (i.e. dependent on time by the unknown way)
component. A random component is the function Fi1(−→k , v||; T ) determined by
the spartial harmonics packet of the INPD
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ) with wave numbers
k, concentrated near 2k0 and calculated relative to the moment t = T . The
e
moment T is determined by the moments of the sounding signal transmitting
and spectral processing receiving window location, and corresponds to the mid-
T0/2. The weight volume K(ω, k, v||)
dle moment between them T = T1 −
determines the parameters of this wave packet, the region of wave vectors and
velocities in Fi1(−→k , v||; T ) which make the main contribution to the scattered
signal at a particular frequency ω.

4.2 Qualitative properties of the weight volume

In this experiment the spectra sounder signal a(ω) and the receiving window
o(ω) are selected such as they are suﬃciently narrow-band ones (1KHz), in com-
parison with the functions ǫ||(ω, 2k0), Ge(ω, 2k0) and fi0(v), in order to improve
the accuracy of their determination from experimental results. Therefore, the
weight function H1(ω, k)
ck/2)a(ck/2) can also be considered narrow-
band from both arguments as compared with the kinetic function ξ(ν, −→k ) from
corresponding arguments. In this case we can approximate the weight volume
K(ω, −→k , v||) as:

The function H1(ω, k) is concentrated near ω = 0, k = 0 [Berngardt and

(∆ωa + ∆ωo), ∆k = (∆ωa + ∆ωo)/c, where ∆ωa, ∆ωo, is the width of bands of
sounder signal spectra and of the spectral processing window, respectively. In
this experiment on ionospheric sounding by the incoherent scatter method, they

5 Discussion

From (14) it follows that the ﬁne structure of the scattered signal spectrum u(ω)
is determined only by the properties of the function
Fi1(−→k , v||; T ) (10) and can
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ) only within the framework of additional
be related to the INPD
assumptions about the structure of
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ). Formally, to determine the
e
function
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ) require measuring the scattered signal for diﬀerent wave
e
numbers k0 of the sounder signal simultaneously.
e

To carry out a qualitative comparison with experimental spectra of incoherently-

e

scattered signals we use the spectral processing window that repeats the sounder
signal shape. Their spectra are approximated by Gaussian-like spectra with a
width equal to their actual spectrum width. According to (14), the spectrum of
Fi1(−→k , v||; T )(10) (con-
the received signal is deﬁned by the unknown function
voluted with a kernel K(ω, −→k , v||)). For comparison with experimental data, we
give following simple model of the function

e
Fi1(−→k , v||; T ).

Simple model Assume that

range of longitudinal wave vectors and velocities of our interest:

fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ) involves only one peak in the

This model corresponds to the fact that the medium involves an isolated spatial
harmonic
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ) at the wave vector −→k1 and with longitudinal velocity
v1, the amplitude of which is signiﬁcantly larger than the amplitudes of spatial
e
harmonics close to it. The spectrum of the received signal will then involve also
only one peak:

and the form and width of this peak will be deﬁned by the product V1(ω
−
k1v1)V2(ω
2k0)c). From the position of the peak in the spectrum
u(ω), one can determine the unknown wave number k1 of the spatial harmonic
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ) that make the main contribution to the scattered signal (20) and
the longitudinal velocity v1 (18) corresponding to the moment T .
e

This model gives the signal spectrum with only one peak. According to the
model, the observed presence of several peaks in the real spectrum corresponds
to existance not only one peculiarity described by the model but a numer of
them.

Let us show that after averaging this model gives as the well known expres-
sion for the IS average spectral power. According traditional approaches lets
suppose that < fi1(~k, ~v, T ) >= fi0(~v)(when
> 0). Summarizing over the

distribution over k, and statistical independence of the values for diﬀerent T (or
when delay between them exceeds the interval in which φ(T ) changes slowly).
Spectra obtained by substituting this simple model (24) into obtained equation
(8), gives us the following single spectrums and their statistical properties, are
shown at Figure 4. As one can see, single realizations of the spectral power(E-
G) have the same structure, as an experimental one (Figure 1), the close peak
width (B) (Figure 2,B), and same relation between mean peak appearence (C)
and average spectral power (D) (Figure 2,C,D). This allows us to suppose that
the model of the scattered signal single spectrum (8) could be used to describe
signal properties, and simpliﬁed model (24) could quilitatively describe the ion
number phase density behavior.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we have suggested an interpretation of separate realizations of in-
coherently scattered signal spectra. It is based on the radar equation [Berngardt
and Potekhin,2000] and kinetic theory of ion-acoustic oscillations of a statisti-
cally homogeneous unmagnetized, collisionless ionospheric plasma with one sort
of ions [Landau,1946].

In accordance with the proposed model (8), the main contribution to the
scattering is made by plasma waves caused by spatial harmonics of ions number
phase density
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ), with wave numbers on the order of the double wave
number of the sounder signal k

It has been shown that the form of the received signal spectrum u(ω) is
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ). At each frequency ω the value of u(ω) is
related to the INPD
determined by Radon’s-like integral
fi1(−→k , −→v ; T ) between the
e
limits of the velocity components across the wave vector −→k (10). The region
e
of wave vectors and longitudinal velocities making contribution to the received
signal −→k , v|| is determined by the weight volume K(ω, −→k , v||) (9).

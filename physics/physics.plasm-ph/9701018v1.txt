Abstract

We study a partially ionized hydrogen plasma by means of quantum molec-
ular dynamics, which is based on wave packets. We introduce a new model
which distinguishes between free and bound electrons. The free electrons are
modelled as Gaussian wave packets with ﬁxed width. For the bound states
the 1s-wave function of the hydrogen atom is assumed. In our simulations
we obtain thermodynamic properties in the equilibrium such as the internal
energy and the degree of ionization. The degree of ionization is in good agree-
ment with theoretical predictions. The thermodynamic functions agree well
with results from quantum statistics for 10000K <∼ T <∼ 40000K.

1 Introduction

An understanding of dense plasmas is important to many areas of physics such as
astrophysics or solid state physics. Because a complete analytic theory has not yet
been advanced, several simulation techniques have been developed [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in
order to determine properties of plasmas. In such systems, however, the fermionic
character and the long-range Coulomb forces cause many diﬃculties.

Quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) has been used to solve these problems
[6, 7]. This method has been developed as an extension of classical molecular dy-
namics [8]. In QMD, wave packets are used as an approximation of the wave function
of particles. Their dynamics can be derived from a time-dependent variational prin-
ciple [6, 9]. It is possible to consider bound states, exchange eﬀects and correlations
in this method.

The traditional QMD technique is based on Gaussian wave packets. The ﬁrst
simulations of this kind were carried out by Heller [10]. This technique was fur-
ther developed in nuclear physics to study scattering processes of nuclei [6, 7] and
recently has been successfully applied to plasma physics by Klakow at el.
[5, 11].
Both equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of dense plasmas can be studied.
In this paper we describe a new QMD model for partially ionized plasmas, which
extends the previous work by incorporating free and bound states and transitions
of the electrons. In plasmas, such transitions can be caused by radiation and by
collisions. Only the latter transitions are important in the range of temperature and
density that we are considering. The description of such processes is very compli-
cated, especially because the microscopic treatment of the 3-particle recombination
is still an open question.

There have been recent attempts made to introduce transitions in QMD. In these
it has been necessary to upgrade to Hamiltonian dynamics by use of additional el-
ements. Ohnishi and Randrup have proposed to allow transitions on the basis of a
stochastic dynamics [12]. Tully has developed a branching concept in order to study
electronic transitions at surfaces [13]. In his approach the Hamiltonian dynamics
was interrupted at certain points and a quantum mechanical transition was carried
out.

In our model we start with a similar idea. In order to describe ionization and
recombination processes we implement two possible transitions: A free electron can
ionize an atom in a collision, and an ion and an electron can recombine in a 3-
particle collision of two free electrons and an ion. We use the well-known cross
In order to model the rather compli-
section for the ionization process [14, 15].
cated recombination process we have developed a preliminary model. We study the
partially ionized, weakly degenerate (neΛ3 <0.15) hydrogen plasma at a density of
1022cm−3 in the temperature range from 10000K to 200000K (see ﬁg. 1). This
1.35
[16] and Klakow et
is a much lower density than those studied by Pierleoni et al.
al. [11]. Simulations based on this model converge into an equilibrium of ionization
and recombination with the degree of ionization in good agreement with theoretical
predictions.

2 Basic assumptions

2.1 Quantum molecular dynamics

Quantum molecular dynamics is a computational technique to study quantum many
body systems. It is based on an approximation for the single particle wave function.
Such a trail state Ψqν (t) contains the essential degrees of freedom and the parameters
qν(t) represent the coordinates in a generalized phase space. The time evolution of
the trail wave function is speciﬁed by the dynamics of the time-dependent parameters
qν(t). For a chosen parameterization of the trial state, the equations of motion for
the parameters can be derived from a time-dependent variational principle [6]:

which leads to a Hamiltonian dynamics for the parameters. Gaussian wave packets
(GWP) obey this type of dynamics.

2.2 Free electrons

GWP have a long tradition in QMD [6, 5, 10, 11, 18, 7]. We use them as trial wave
function to describe the free electrons in the plasma:

The position ~r and the momentum ~p stand for the expectation values of the rele-
vant quantum mechanical operators. The parameter γ determines the width of the
[5] made the ﬁrst plasma simulation with GWP. In
wave packet. Klakow et al.
their model γ is a complex parameter of the dynamics and an additional degree of
freedom of the trial wave function. We have shown that this ansatz leads at high
temperatures to a heat capacity per electron greater than 3

2 kB [17].

Because of this principle problem we ﬁxed the width of the GWP in our simula-

tions. A condition for γ can be derived from the Kelbg potential [19]:

2.3 Bound electrons

In our simulation we consider the 1s-ground state of hydrogen explicitly. The best
approximation for the ground state with GWP leads to an energy of 11.5 eV instead
of 13.6 eV [11]. GWP with a dynamics derived from (1) have a continuous spectrum
of excitation and a gap is missing. This results into unphysical excitations in many
particle simulations and strongly inﬂuences the thermodynamic properties of the
system [17]. That is why we introduce a 1s wave function (1sWF) to describe
bound states,

where ~rI is the position of the core. This wave function is an eigenstate of the
Schr¨odinger equation.

2.4 Simulation of Hydrogen Plasma

The hydrogen plasma consists of ions with positive charge and electrons with neg-
ative charge. In order to incorporate quantum mechanical eﬀects, the electrons in
our model are treated as wave packets. The ions, which have much greater mass, are
considered to be classical particles. We distinguish between free and bound states
of the electrons by representing free electrons by GWP (6) and bound electrons by
1sWF (10). Our method is based on the Hamilton function H, which consists of the
several parts,

The classical ions contribute kinetic and potential energy,

H = Ti + Te + Vii + Vee + Vei

An atom in the simulation consists of a proton and an electron in the 1s-ground
state. The interaction potentials of atoms are obtained by adding the contributions
from both parts.

The ansatz (6) reveals the extra term 3/(2mγ2) in the kinetic energy of a GWP
(20), which has its origin in the shape of the GWP. Since Te,GW P is not consistent
with the classical limit of free particles for high temperatures ~p 2/2m we omit this
term.

3 Thermodynamic Model

In this paragraph it will be shown how the QMD can be used to determine the degree
of ionization ¯z (the average charge number) of the plasma. In the usual approach
one derives the degree of ionization from the free energy F , which is minimal at

5

constant volume and temperature. Alternatively it can be determined by using the
condition that the internal energy U is minimal at constant entropy and volume.

∂F
∂ ¯z !T,V,n

 

= 0

,

∂U
∂ ¯z !S,V,n

 

= 0 .

(26)

The free energy is not available in QMD simulations. That is why the second
condition is used to ﬁnd the equilibrium-degree of ionization. In order to ﬁnd the
minimum of the internal energy U a number of separate simulations with diﬀerent
degrees of ionization were carried out without including transitions between free and
bound states.

The entropy must be the same in all of these simulations. This requires a diﬀerent
temperature in every simulation. It can be obtained from entropy function S, which
has to be known in our method. We use the entropy of the ideal hydrogen plasma,

S(Ne, Ni, N0) =

log

Λ3
kNk
gkV !#

 

, Λk =

h
(2πmkkBT )1/2

.

(27)

Nk is the number of particle in the volume V and gk is the degeneracy parameter
due to the spin, where the index k runs over all particle types. If one describes a
hydrogen plasma in the chemical picture [20] one has to consider atoms (g0=2), ions
(gi=1) and free electrons (ge=2). The degree of ionization is deﬁned by ¯z = Ne/N,
where Ne=Ni and N = N0 + Ni.

Under the condition of ﬁxed entropy the appropriate temperature can be de-
rived by equation (27) for any degree of ionization.
In the simulations we use a
velocity-scaling procedure [8], which forces the system towards the desired temper-
ature. Then the internal energy is obtained by averaging over many phase space
conﬁgurations of the system.
In this way the internal energy can be determined
point by point on an adiabatic and its minimum can be found. The exact value
for the minimum is obtained by quadratic approximation (ﬁg. 2). The temperature
belonging to this minimum has to be calculated from (27) since the temperature in
all simulations is diﬀerent.

Results

1022cm−3 in
We study a partially ionized hydrogen plasma at a density of 1.35
the temperature range from 10000K to 200000K. The plasma is weakly degenerate:
neΛ3 < 0.15, where ne is the density of the free electrons derived from the ideal
Saha equation [20]. We consider 32 electrons and 32 ions in our simulations.

×

In ﬁgure 3, the degree of ionization from the simulation in the thermodynamical
model is compared with results from the Pad´e approximation in the chemical picture
(PACH) [21] and from the ideal Saha equation. The PACH approach is based on
Pad´e formulae for the thermodynamic functions [22] and on the non-ideal Saha
equation [20]. All methods show no ionization below 20000K, then the degree of
ionization increases sharply. The values from our simulation and from the PACH

are higher than that of the ideal plasma because the Coulomb interaction leads to
a reduction of the eﬀective ionization energy. At higher temperatures, the Coulomb
interaction is less important, therefore the diﬀerence between the results from our
simulation and the ideal Saha equation becomes smaller. The values from the PACH
are still 6% higher because the Planck-Larkin partition function, which takes into
account excited states is used in these formulas [20].

The internal energy per particle from the simulation in the thermodynamic
model uth, from the PACH uP ACH and from the ideal plasma uid are shown in ﬁgure
4 and 5. Under 20000K hydrogen behaves like an atomic gas, so u increases like
3/2 kBT. All three theories coincide in this region. With increasing temperature uth
and uP ACH rise more quickly than uid because of the higher degree of ionization,
which leads to addtitional contributions to the kinetic energy. At high temperatures,
negative contributions from the Coulomb interaction determine the corrections to
uid. So uth and uP ACH intersect with uid at an intermediate temperature.

The agreement between the uth and uP ACH is fairly good in the region 10000K<∼
T<∼ 50000K. For higher temperatures, deviations start to occur. Above 75000K, uth
and uP ACH show the same behavior but diﬀer by a constant. The PACH predicts a
smaller energy although the degree of ionization is higher. One possible explanation
is that there are no interactions of charged and neutral particles taken into account
in these formulas. Further we have to mention that our approach neglects excited
states, which are taken into account in the PACH approach [21].

4 Dynamic Equilibrium of Ionization and Recom-

bination

There have been several attempts to model reactions by QMD. Tully developed
a branching concept for transitions between diﬀerent electronic states [13]. In this
approach, the transition probabilities were derived from a Greens function technique.
Hamiltonian dynamics is still used most of the simulation. Only in the case of a
transition, dynamics are interrupted, new initial conditions for the particles are
formulated and then the dynamics are continued.

In our simulation we must deal with ionization and recombination processes.
If an electron with an impact energy greater than 1 Ry collides with an atom,
ionization can take place. In order to include such transitions in QMD, knowledge
of the microscopic dynamics of such a process is necessary. The ionization of one
hydrogen atom in a plasma was studied in [23]. Here we investigate the much
more complicated case where many atoms are present and include ionization as
well as recombination. The ionization cross section for hydrogen is known various
theoretical and experimental predictions [15, 14]. We use the semi-empirical formula
[15, 23]:

Adapting the cross section to the wave packet model we imagine a sphere of
σI (E)/π around every atom. If a free electron enters this sphere with an
radius
impact energy E greater the 1 Ry the ionization of the atom occurs. The electron

in the 1s ground state is replaced by free GWP, which is place at the opposite point
on the sphere. The momenta are chosen arbitrarily under conservation of energy.

A microscopic description of the recombination process is more diﬃcult. How-
ever special information on recombination is available from various investigations.
Besides the cross sections in diﬀerent approximations which were derived from scat-
tering theory, also the global recombination rate β is known from the theory of the
rate coeﬃcients [14, 24]. A microscopic description of the recombination process
in QMD has not been derived yet. As a preliminary model we propose the follow-
ing mechanism: If two electrons are simultaneously in a sphere of radius ρR = 1
aB around an ion the recombination will take place. One electron is moved into
the ground state and the other changes its momentum so that the total energy is
conserved.

Results

We carried out simulations the the same density from 30000K (128 ions and 128
electrons) to 200000K (32 ions and 32 electrons). The system converges into a
dynamic equilibrium of ionization and recombination. The degree of ionization we
get from this simple model is surprisingly good (ﬁg.3). It agrees well with the PACH
approach in the considered temperature range. We do not claim that we give with
our simple microscopic model a rigorous description of the recombination process
but, rather, we deduce that our mechanism leads to a correct global rate β in the
temperature range studied here. Correct in context means that the average number
of recombination processes per time unit is in agreement with the number ionization
processes so that the detailed balance is satisﬁed.

In our model, we have found a dependence of β on ρR and a setting of ρR = 1a0

turned out to be a good estimate.

The internal energy u derived from this simulations leads to qualitatively correct
results (ﬁg.4) but quantitatively the results only agree well up to temperature of
40000K (ﬁg.5). Beyond of that our results are systematically high in comparison to
the PACH, which may be caused by an insuﬃcient description of the electron-ion
interaction. because our results were generally too high in comparison to the PACH
model. Evidently simulations above 40000K require a more precise description of
the interaction between free electrons and ions than that given in our QMD model.

5 Conclusion

We expect that the model presented in this paper will prove to be a promising
approach for the description of plasmas in the partially ionized region. We have
substantially extended the traditional QMD model with the consideration of free
and bound states. We have shown how thermodynamical functions can be derived
from a model with free and bound states but still without transitions. Furthermore
we presented preliminary model for the dynamic description of ionization and re-
combination in plasmas. As ﬁrst test we calculated the degree of ionization and the

10

internal energy of the hydrogen plasma.

The model can be improved in several ways. First of all a detailed quantum me-
chanical description of the 3-body recombination process would be useful in future
studies. Furthermore it would be interesting to study the formation of molecules
[17]. One must also take into account the fermionic character of the electron wave
function [7, 11]. Our results oﬀer hope that it soon will be possible to describe
hydrogen in the whole temperature range from the molecular gas to the completely
ionized plasma.

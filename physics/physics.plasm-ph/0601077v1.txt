Abstract

The charge reduction eﬀect, produced by the nonlinear Debye screening of high-Z charges oc-

curing in strongly-coupled plasmas, is investigated. An analytic asymptotic expression is obtained

for the charge reduction factor (fc) which determines the Debye-H¨uckel potential generated by a

charged test particle. Its relevant parametric dependencies are analyzed and shown to predict a

strong charge reduction eﬀect in strongly-coupled plasmas.

A basic aspect of plasma physics is the so-called Debye shielding of the electrostatic po-

tential. This consists in the property of plasmas (or electrolytes [1]), either quasi-neutral or

non-neutral, to shield the electrostatic ﬁeld produced by charged particles (to be also denoted

as test particles) immersed in the same system. This result has fundamental consequences

on plasma phenomenology, since it actually limits the range of static Coulomb interactions

inside the Debye sphere, i.e., at a distance ρ ≤ λD from the test particle, λD being the
−1

Debye length. As usual here λD ≡

, where the sum is carried out on all plasma

species and λDs =

Ts
s e2Nos , Ts and Nos being respectively the s−species temperature
and number density (the latter deﬁned in the absence of test particles). In fact, when both

the particles and the plasma are assumed non-relativistic, small-amplitude, stationary (or

slowly time- and space-varying), electrostatic perturbations generated by isolated test parti-

cles, result eﬀectively shielded in the external domain, i.e., at distances larger than the Debye

length λD. The renewed interest in this problem is particularly related to dusty plasmas

or colloidal suspensions [2, 3] which are characterized by the presence of a large fraction of

highly charged particles (grains), i.e., having an electric charge Zde with |Zd| ≫ 1. It is well

established that the phenomenon of Debye shielding of the electrostatic potential generated

by a slowly moving or stationary charged test particle, when occurring in strongly coupled

ionized gases, manifests peculiar properties. These are produced, as a consequence of the

nonlinear plasma response occurring at distances smaller than the Debye length λD, when

the electrostatic potential (Φ) results locally such that

Φ ≡ |eΦ| /To ∼ 1 (or even ≫ 1),

ρo from the position of the test particle r(t) and To ≡ Ti. The distance ρo can be identiﬁed

with the radius of the local plasma sheath around a test particle. For spherically-symmetric

test particles such a domain can be identiﬁed with the spherical subset of the conﬁguration

space, of radius ρo ≡

(average interparticle distance), No ≡ Noi being the density

of the ion species, in which each test particle can be considered as isolated. Ionized gases

(cid:17)

(or electrolytes) can be classiﬁed according to the characteristic dimensionless parameters
xo = ρo/λD ≡ g1/3 and Γ ≡ β/xo (where β = Zde2
4πToλD is denoted as the dimensionless elec-
tric charge of the test particle), g and Γ being respectively so-called plasma and Coulomb

coupling parameters. In particular, for plasmas the high-density requirement x3

o ≡ g ≪ 1
is satisﬁed by assumption and can be interpreted as the condition that the total number of

2

mutually interacting particles in a Debye sphere (expressed by 1/g) results ≫ 1. Instead,

the ordering of parameter Γ remains in principle arbitrary. Thus, the orderings Γ ≪ 1 and

Γ ∼ 1 (or Γ ≫ 1) correspond respectively to so-called weakly and strongly-coupled plas-

mas. Dusty and colloidal plasmas may be characterized by Zd up to 104 − 106 with typical
grain size smaller than 10−4 cm and with plasma temperature and the ion density To ∼ 1
eV, No ∼ 108 − 1010 cm−3. In this case the Coulomb parameter for a negatively-charged

grain in the presence of the plasma sheath produced by hydrogen ions can result as large
as Γ ∼= (10−2 − 10−3)Zd, while the dimensionless radius of the ion plasma sheath can be
∼= 0.01 − 0.05. Therefore, dusty plasmas typically result strongly coupled if
estimated xo
Zd & 103. For these plasmas it is important to be able to evaluate the electrostatic potential

generated by dust grains which is expected to be strongly inﬂuenced by Debye shielding.

It is well-known that, in general, this phenomenon occurs provided suitable physical as-

sumptions are introduced. In particular, the plasma must be assumed appropriately close to

kinetic Maxwellian equilibrium, in which each particle species is described by a Maxwellian

kinetic distribution function carrying ﬁnite ﬂuid ﬁelds [deﬁned respectively by the number

density, temperature and ﬂow velocity (N, T, V)]. In the absence of test particles these ﬂuid

ﬁelds must be assumed slowly varying in a suitable sense, or constant, both with respect

to position (r) and time (t).

In this regard it is important to remark that the appropriate

treatment of the plasma sheath surrounding each test particle is essential also for the validity

of the mathematical model for the Debye screening problem, i.e., for the existence of classical

solutions of the Debye screening problem, which do not exist when letting xo = 0 [4]. As a

consequence the electrostatic potential depends necessarily on the dimensionless parameter

xo. In particular, in the domain x ≥ xo the dimensionless potential
a dust grain of charge Zde < 0, fulﬁlling the boundary conditions d

Another useful representation of Eq.(1) can also be obtained by means of the transformation

ﬁnite xo, the Debye-H¨uckel asymptotic approximation for the electrostatic potential can be

proven to hold when measuring the potential at a position r suﬃciently far from the position

of the test particle r(t). In fact this involves imposing that the so-called weak-ﬁeld condition

Φxo(x) ≪ 1 be locally satisﬁed. As a consequence, the normalized electrostatic potential

generated by a spherically-symmetric point particle of charge Ze can be approximated by

the weak-ﬁeld condition is satisﬁed. The remaining notation is standard, thus ρ = |r − r(t)|

is the distance from the point charge and x ≡ ρ/λD ∈ [xo, ∞] is the corresponding normalized

distance. The weak-ﬁeld condition is manifestly locally satisﬁed both for strongly and weakly

coupled plasmas, provided there results x > 1, with x suitably large (i.e., x ≫ 1). However,

in the case in which there results either xo ≪ 1 and/or Γ ≫ 1, i.e., for strongly-coupled

plasmas, the electrostatic potential may actually decay on a scale much shorter than the

Debye length and precisely on a scale suitably close to the boundary of the plasma sheath,

i.e., for xo . x ≪ 1. This conclusion is consistent both with previous analytic estimates

based on the exact solution of the 1D Debye screening problem [5] and direct numerical

simulations of the 3D Debye screening problem [6, 7, 8, 9]. It implies, however, that the

DH approximation typically holds also at distances suitably larger than the boundary of the

plasma sheath xo and which extend also to values comparable to the Debye length, i.e., for

xo ≪ x . 1 [10]. Finally, as a further consequence, the eﬀective electric charge carried by the

DH potential q may appear signiﬁcantly reduced with respect to the case of weakly coupled

plasmas [6, 8, 9, 11, 12]. To display this eﬀect, it is convenient to represent the normalized

eﬀective charge of the test particle in the form q ≡ βfc, fc being the charge reduction factor.

By dimensional analysis, it follows that fc must be of the form fc = fc(xo, β, ξs), i.e., fc is

function, to be determined, of the only dimensionless parameters of the problem, namely xo

and Γ (or β) and moreover the ratios ξs (with s = e, i, d). It is well-known that for weakly-

coupled plasmas q can be approximated by the normalized electric charge of the isolated
test particle, i.e., q ∼= β, which implies fc
∼= 1. Instead, for strongly-coupled plasmas, the

value of charge reduction factor, determined either via one-dimensional analytic estimates

[5] or by means of a variety of numerical simulation methods (see, for example, [6, 7, 8, 9]),

has been found to be notably smaller than unity, thus suggesting the existence of a possible

signiﬁcant charge reduction eﬀect.

Indeed the investigation of the eﬀective interactions

characterizing high-Z grains in plasmas has attracted interest in recent years especially for

their role in dusty plasmas [11, 12]. However, for strongly-coupled plasmas the precise form

of the function fc is still unknown and, in particular, an analytic estimate of the eﬀective

charge characterizing the DH potential in strongly-coupled plasmas is not yet available.

Besides being of obvious interest as a still unsolved mathematical problem, it is especially

important from the physical standpoint to estimate fc as a function of the parameters xo

and Γ for strongly coupled plasmas characterized either by a high density and/or by the

presence of a large fraction of highly charged particles (grains), such as dusty plasmas and

colloidal suspensions [2, 3].

In a previous work [4], the Debye screening problem (DSP) has been formulated for an

electron-hydrogen plasma in order to analyze the asymptotic properties of its solutions near

the plasma sheath (i.e., for x suitably close to xo). For this purpose the case of a strongly-

5

coupled plasma was investigated in which the parameters xo and Γ satisfy the asymptotic
conditions, to be denoted as strong-coupling ordering, Γ ∼ 1
O(δ) ≫ 1 with xo ∼ O(δk),
k = 0, 1and δ an inﬁnitesimal. The similar case of three-species plasma can be obtained

directly. As a result, invoking for

Φxo(x) the representation (3), together with Eqs.(4),(5)

and imposing the appropriate boundary conditions for

Φxo(x), it follows that the integral

b

on the r.h.s. of Eq.(2) can be estimated asymptotically to yield an asymptotic equation for

In particular,

for an electron-hydrogen plasma in which the contribution to λD due to the

dusty species is negligible, there results |Zi| = 1 and ξi = 1/2 and this reduces (8) to the

expression given in Ref. [4]. In addition, neglecting higher-order inﬁnitesimals of order O(δr)

(r > 0 being a suitable real number), the following inequality can immediately be proven

fc ≤ c(a)(xo, β) [1 + O(δr)] ,

c(a)(xo, β) ≡ xo

Φo(xo, β),

b

c(a)(xo, β) being an asymptotic upper bound for the charge reduction factor. This result,

as indicated below, is relevant to investigate the charge reduction eﬀect in strongly-coupled

plasmas.

In this paper we propose a more accurate asymptotic approximation for fc, potentially

useful to analyze the charge reduction eﬀect of high-Z test particles taking place in strongly-

coupled plasmas. In particular, we intend to prove that, in validity of the previous strong-

coupling ordering, the charge reduction factor can be approximated in the form:

where, xc is deﬁned so that xc > xo and is provided by the root of the equation

It is immediate to prove that Eq.(16) is equivalent to the condition of stationarity for the
function f (a)

(x, xo, β)

Therefore Eq.(17) also furnishes the same asymptotic approximation for the charge reduction

factor given by Eq.(11). The accuracy of the asymptotic approximation c(b)(xo, β) and of
the upper bound c(a)(xo, β) can be tested by comparing them with the estimate of the

charge reduction factor obtained from direct numerical simulations of the 3D Debye screening

problem. For this purpose the function

g(x, xo, β) = xex−xo

Φxo(x)/β

has to be evaluated numerically by solving the Debye-Poisson equation. The charge reduc-

tion factor is deﬁned as the limit

fc(xo, β) = lim
x→+∞

xex−xo

Φxo(x)/β.

In practice, for numerical estimates it can be approximated by fc(xo, β) ∼= g(xf , xo, β) with

xf to be suitably deﬁned. It is important to stress that, in the limit δ → 0, one expects

In addition, it must result also

c(b)(xo, β) = lim

c(a)(xo, β).

(20)

(21)

Therefore, for δ small enough (i.e., for Γ ≫ 1 and/or xo ≪ 1), it it actually possible
to approximate fc(xo, β) both in terms of c(b)(xo, β) and c(a)(xo, β). Numerical simulations
indicate, however, that the asymptotic estimate c(b)(xo, β) actually converges rapidly to

fc(xo, β) and furnishes therefore a more accurate approximation than the upper bound
c(a)(xo, β). Nevertheless, particularly thanks to Eq.(21), c(a)(xo, β) can still be used for order-

of-magnitude estimates.

In ﬁgures 1 the result of two numerical simulations are reported, for the case of an electron-

hydrogen plasma and for ξi = 1/2, which correspond respectively to (xo, β) = (0.08, 2.5) and

(xo, β) = (0.15, 10). In both cases the matching point xc is found to be close to the boundary

of the plasma sheath, which implies that the DH potential actually approximately applies for

x ≥ xc. The upper bound estimate c(a)(xo, β) can be used for order-of-magnitude estimates of
the charge reduction eﬀect. Finally, the parametric dependencies of c(a)(xo, β) with respect

to β and xo are displayed for selected values of the parameters. Figures 2 demonstrate that

for typical values of the Coulomb parameter Γ and the radius of the plasma sheath xo the

eﬀective electric charge of the DH potentially appear dramatically reduced.

The present results are relevant for the investigation of strongly-coupled plasmas, such

as dusty plasmas, in which a signiﬁcant fraction of high-Z charged particles is present.

In fact, the charge reduction eﬀect has fundamental consequences on the Debye screening

phenomenon, since it actually limits the magnitude of the Coulomb interactions produced by

these particles. The estimate of the charge reduction factor fc, here obtained, is a necessary

prerequisite for the description of a variety of kinetic processes (for example, condensation

[13], collisional processes [14, 15], etc.), as well as electrostatic or electromagnetic instabilities

in dusty plasmas (see for example [16, 17]).

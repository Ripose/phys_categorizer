Electron–ion binary collisions in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld

Binary collisions between ions and electrons in an external magnetic ﬁeld are considered in second-
order perturbation theory, starting from the unperturbed helical motion of the electrons. The
calculations are done with the help of an improved BC which is uniformly valid for any strength of
the magnetic ﬁeld and the second-order energy and velocity transfers are treated in the interaction
in Fourier space without specifying the interaction potential. The energy transfer is explicitly
calculated for a regularized and screened potential which is both of ﬁnite range and less singular than
the Coulomb interaction at the origin and as the limiting cases involves the Debye (i.e., screened) and
Coulomb potentials. Two particular cases are considered in detaile: (i) Ion motion parallel to the
magnetic ﬁeld with an arbitrary strength. The energy transfer involves all harmonics of the electron
cyclotron motion. (ii) The ion arbitrary motion with respect to the strong magnetic ﬁeld when
the electron cyclotron radius is much smaller than other characteristic length scales (e.g., screening
length, pitch of electron helix etc.). In the latter case the energy transfer receives two contributions
which are responsible for the electron guiding center and cyclotron orbit perturbations.

INTRODUCTION

In the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld B the problem of two charged particles cannot be solved in a closed
form as the relative motion and the motion of the center of mass are coupled to each other. Therefore no theory
exists for a solution of this problem that is uniformly valid for any strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and the Coulomb
force between the particles. The energy loss of ion beams and the related processes in a magnetized plasmas which
are important in many areas of physics such as transport, heating, magnetic conﬁnement of thermonuclear plasmas
and astrophysics are examples of physical situations where this problem arises. Recent applications are the cooling
of heavy ion beams by electrons [1, 2, 3] and the energy transfer for heavy-ion inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) (see,
e.g., [4] for an overview). The classical limit of a hydrogen or Rydberg atom in a strong magntic ﬁeld also falls in this
category (see, e.g., [5] and references therein) but in contrast to the free-free transitions (scattering) the total energy
is negative there.

Numerical calculations have been performed for binary collisions (BC) between magnetized electrons [6, 7] and for
collisions between magnetized electrons and ions [8, 9, 10]. In general the total energy W of the particles interacting in
a magnetic ﬁeld is conserved but the relative and center of mass energies are not conserved separetely. In addition, the
presence of the magnetic ﬁeld breaks the rotational symmetry of the system and as a consequence only the component
of the angular momentum L parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld Lk is a constant of motion. A diﬀerent situation arises for
the BC between an electron and heavy ion. As an ion is much heavier than an electron, its uniform motion is only
weakly perturbed by collisions with the electrons and the magnetic ﬁeld. In this case Lk is not conserved but there
exists a conserved generalized energy K [10, 11] involving the energy of relative motion and a magnetic term. The
seemingly simple problem of a charged particle interaction in a magnetic ﬁeld is in fact a problem of considerable
complexity and the additional degree of freedom of the cyclotron orbital motion produces a chaotic system with two
degrees (or one degree for heavy ions) of freedom [12, 13, 14].

In this paper we consider the BC between electrons and heavy ion treating the interaction (Coulomb) with the ion
as a perturbation to the helical motion of the magnetized electrons. This has been done previously in ﬁrst order in the
ion charge Z and for an ion at rest [15] and in up to O(Z 2) for uniformly moving heavy ion [11, 16]. In Ref. [16] three
regimes are identiﬁed, depending on the relative size of the parameters a (the cyclotron radius), s (the distance of the
closest approach), and δ (the pitch of the helix). In earlier kinetic approaches [1, 2, 3] only two regimes have been
distinguished: Fast collisions for s < a, where the Coulomb interaction is dominant and adiabatic collisions for s > a,
where the magnetic ﬁeld is important, as the electron performs many gyrations during the collision with the ion. The
change ∆Ei of the energy of the ion has been related to the square of the momentum transfer ∆p, which has been

calculated up to O(Z). This is somewhat unsatisfactory, as there is another O(Z 2) contribution to ∆Ei, in which the
second-order momentum transfer enters linearly. Moreover, for applications in plasma physics (e.g., for calculation
of the ion energy loss in a magnetized plasma) one calculates the angular avereged energy transfer which vanishes
within ﬁrst-order perturbation theory due to symmetry reasons and the ion energy change receives contribution only
from higher orders [11]. Indeed, the transport phenomena, etc., are of order O(Z 2) in the ion charge.

In this paper we consider BC between ion and electrons in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld within the second order
perturbation theory. The present paper is a continuation of our earlier study in Ref. [11] where the second-order
energy transfer is calculated with the help of an improved BC treatment which is uniformly valid for any strength
of the magnetic ﬁeld and does not require the speciﬁcation of the interaction potential. The paper is organized as
follows. In Sec. II starting from the exact equation of motion of two charged particles moving in a magnetic ﬁeld
we discuss some basic results of the exact BC treatment for the energy and velocity transfers as well as the energy
conservation. In the following Sec. III, we discuss the velocity and energy transfer during BC of magnetized electrons
with ions for arbitrary magnetic ﬁelds and strengths of the electron-ion interaction potential. We assume that the
ion mass M is much larger than the electron mass m. The equations of motion are solved in a perturbative manner
up to the second order in Z starting from the unperturbed helical motion of the electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld. Then
in Secs. IV and V we turn to the explicit calculation of the ion second order energy transfer. For further applications
(e.g., in cooling of ion beams) we consider the regularized and screened interaction potential which is both of ﬁnite
range and less singular than the Coulomb interaction at the origin and as the limiting cases involves the Debye (i.e.,
screened) and Coulomb potentials. In Sec. IV the theory is applied to the energy transfer of an heavy ion moving
parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld B but without any restriction on B. The obtained energy transfer involves all cyclotron
harmonics of the electron helical motion. The case of the strong magnetic ﬁeld and arbitrary motion of the ion with
respect to B is derived in Sec. V. It is shown that the energy transfer contains two terms which are responsible for
the electron guiding center and cyclotron motion perturbations. In Sec. VI the results are summed up; some formulas
for the second-order treatment are presented in the Appendices A and B.

II. BINARY COLLISION FORMULATION. GENERAL TREATMENT

Below we discuss the general equations of motion for two charged particles moving in a homogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld and the remaining conservation laws. From the velocity transfer we then proceed the energy transfer of particles
during binary collision process. As shown in Ref. [11], the present treatment becomes more transparent in Fourier
space.

A. Relative motion and conservation laws

We consider two point charges with masses m1, m2 and charges q1e, q2e, respectively, moving in a homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld B = Bb. We assume that the particles interact with the potential q1q2e/2U (r) with e/2 = e2/4πε0,
where ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum and r = r1 − r2 is the relative coordinate of colliding particles. For
charged particles the function U (r) can be expressed, for instance, by the Coulomb potential, UC(r) = 1/r. In plasma
applications the inﬁnite range of this potential is modiﬁed by the screening, e.g. UD(r) = e−r/λ/r with a screening
length λ which can be chosen as the Debye screening length λD, see, for example [17]. The quantum uncertainty
principle prevents particles from falling into the center of these potentials. In a classical picture this can be achieved
e−r/λ/r, see for example [18, 19], where λ is a parameter, which
by regularization at the origin UR(r) =
may be related to the de Broglie wavelength.

1 − e−r/λ

In the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld, the Lagrangian and the corresponding equations of particles motion
cannot, in general, be separated into parts describing the relative motion and the motion of the center of mass with
velocities v, Vcm and coordinates r, Rcm, respectively (see, e.g., [6]). Introducing the reduced mass 1/µ = 1/m1+1/m2
the equations of motion are

where q1q2e/2F (r(t)) (F = −∂U/∂r) is the force exerted by the particle 2 on the particle 1. (The force which acts
on the particle 2 is −q1q2e/2F (r(t))). The frequencies Ω1, Ω2, Ω3 and Ω4 are expressed in terms of the cyclotron

frequencies ωc1 = |q1|eB/m1 and ωc2 = |q2|eB/m2 of the particles 1 and 2, respectively,

Here ςν = |qν | /qν with ν = 1, 2. From Eqs. (1) and (2) follows the conservation of total energy

but the relative and center of mass energies are not conserved separately.

The coupled, nonlinear diﬀerential equations (1) and (2) completely describe the motion of the particles. They have
to be integrated numerically for a complete set of the initial conditions for solving the scattering problem. In the case
of interaction of heavy ions (m2 = M , q2 = Z) with electrons (m1 = m, q1 = −1), i.e. M ≫ m, the equations of
motion can be further simpliﬁed, since µ → m, Ω1, Ω2 → 0 and Ω3, Ω4 → ωc (see Eqs. (3) and (4)), where ωc = eB/m
is the cyclotron frequency of electrons. Equation (2) leads to Vcm → vi = const, where vi is the heavy ion velocity,
and Eq. (1) turns into

˙v(t) + ωc [v(t) × b] = −ωc [vi × b] −

With the help of the equation of motion (6) it can be easily proven that the quantity

is a constant of motion. In contrast to the unmagnetized case, it thus follows that the relative energy transfer during
ion-electron collision is proportional to δr⊥vi⊥, where δr⊥ and vi⊥ are the perpendicular components of the change
of relative position and the ion velocity.

The rate at which the energy of an ion in a collision with an electron at time t changes is given by

as Ze/2F (r) is the force exerted by the electron on the ion. Integration with respect to time yields the energy transfer

which after completion of the collision becomes

Here one has to integrate the equations of motion for the relative trajectories. The limit M ≫ m leading to Eq. (3)
implies that the change in the ion energy is calculated under the assumption of a constant ion velocity. Alternatively
this energy transfer can be expressed by the velocity transferred to the electrons during the collision. For that purpose
we substitute vi = ve(t) − v(t) into Eq. (10) and split the electron velocity into two terms ve(t) = ve0(t) + δv(t),
where ve0(t) describes the helical motion in the magnetic ﬁeld

this method has been adopted in [16]. In this approach the potential U (r) has to be speciﬁed at an early stage. In
Sec. III we will show that Eq. (10) allows for a more general formulation in which the cut–oﬀ at large distances and
the regularization at small distances can be treated easily.

Until now we have considered the energy transfer of an ion. In addition this energy transfer, ∆Ei, can be expressed
by the change of the relative energy, ∆Er, and the electron momentum transfer ∆p = m∆v. Because we are dealing
with heavy ion with vi = const, the relative velocity transfer is the same as for the electrons, i.e. δv(t). Since the
unperturbed relative velocity is v0(t) = ve0(t) − vi (see Eq. (27) below) we can establish a simple relation between
energy transfers ∆Ei and ∆Er given by

∆Ei = −∆Er − vi · ∆p.

It is clear that the relative energy and momentum transfers depend only on the relative quantities and the ion velocity
vi is not explicitly involved in ∆Er and ∆p. Thus, having the ion energy transfer the other quantities can be easily
extracted from Eq. (22).

III. PERTURBATIVE TREATMENT. GENERAL THEORY

A. Trajectory correction

In this section we seek an approximate solution of Eq. (12) in which the interaction force between the ion and
electrons is considered as a perturbation. Thus we have to look for the solution of Eq. (12) for the variables r and v
in a perturbative manner

r(t) = r0(t) + r1(t) + r2(t)...,

v(t) = v0(t) + v1(t) + v2(t)...,

(23)

where r0(t), v0(t) are the unperturbed ion-electron relative coordinate and velocity, respectively, rn(t), vn(t) ∝
Z nFn−1 (n = 1, 2, ...) are the nth order perturbations of r(t) and v(t), which are proportional to Z n. Fn(t) is
the nth order correction to the ion-electron interaction force. Using the expansion (23) for the nth order corrections
Fn we obtain

F (r(t)) = F0 (r0(t)) + F1 (r0(t), r1(t)) + ...,

where

F1 (r0(t), r1(t)) =

r1(t) ·

In Eqs. (25) and (26), we have introduced the ion-electron interaction potential U (r) through F(r) = −∂U (r)/∂r and
the force corrections have been written using a Fourier transformation in space.

We start with the zero-order unperturbed helical motion of the electrons. From Eq. (11) we obtain

v0(t) = vr + ve⊥ {u cos(ωct) + [b × u] sin(ωct)} ,

r0(t) = R0 + vrt + a {u sin(ωct) − [b × u] cos(ωct)} ,

where u = (cos ϕ, sin ϕ) is the unit vector perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, vek and ve⊥ (with ve⊥ ≥ 0) are the
electron unperturbed velocity components parallel and perpendicular to b, respectively, vr = vekb − vi is the relative
velocity of the electron guiding center, and a = ve⊥/ωc is the cyclotron radius. It should be noted that in Eqs. (27)
and (28), the variables u and R0 are independent and are deﬁned by the initial conditions.

The equation for the ﬁrst-order velocity correction is given by

with ν = −tVk(t)
t→−∞ and have assumed that all corrections vanish at t → −∞. For instance, in the unscreened
Coulomb case, the interaction force F0 must behave as F0 (r0(t)) → 1/t2 for |t| → ∞. Thus from Eq. (32) at t → ∞
we obtain Vk(t) → V0k = const and V⊥(t) → eiωctV0⊥, where V0⊥ = const. The quantities V0k and V0⊥ give the ﬁrst
order velocity correction in Eq. (30) after an electron-ion collision. In this limit, we ﬁnd for the ﬁrst order trajectory
correction from Eqs. (32) and (33) Pk(t) = V0kt + P0k, P⊥(t) = −i (V0⊥/ωc) eiωct + ˜P0⊥, where

of this term to the ion energy change vanishes after averaging over impact parameters.

Substituting Eqs. (25) and (28) into Eq. (33), and using the Fourier series of the exponential function eiz sin θ [20],

where Jn are the Bessel functions of the nth order. Here ζn(k) = nωc + k · vr, ψ = ϕ − θ, tan θ = ky/kx and k⊥ is the

and (36) through the relations Vk(t) = ˙Pk(t) and V⊥(t) = ˙P⊥(t).

It should be noted that Eqs. (30) and (31) give formal but exact solutions for the velocity and trajectory corrections
to the unperturbed quantities in Eqs. (27) and (28) if the ﬁrst order force F0 (r0) in Eqs. (32) and (33) is replaced
by the exact one, F (r) with exact relative coordinate r. Substituting Eqs. (30) and (31) with exact force F (r) into

We now introduce the variable s = R(r)

helical motion. The energy loss is now given by the average of ∆Ei with respect to the initial phase of the electrons
ϕ and the azimuthal angle of s. For spherically symmetric interaction potentials (U (r) = U (r) and U (k) = U (k)) the
ﬁrst order energy transfer gives no contribution due to symmetry and the ion energy change receives a contribution

This series representation of the second-order energy transfer is valid for any strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. Besides
the direction b of the magnetic ﬁeld and the direction nr = vr/vr of the relative velocity is singled out in the argument

of the δ-function and summand of the n-summation. This prevents a closed evaluation of the energy transfer (46).
However the limiting case of an ion motion parallel to a magnetic ﬁeld of arbitrary strength and the case of an
arbitrary motion in a strong magnetic ﬁeld can be treated in a straightforward manner.

The calculation of the angular-averaged relative energy and momentum transfers is performed by the similar method
as for deriving Eq. (46). Note, however, that due to the symmetry reason the transverse part of the momentum transfer
vanishes, vi⊥ · h∆p⊥i = 0, and Eq. (22) is reduced to h∆E(2)

IV.

ION PARALLEL MOTION AND ARBITRARY MAGNETIC FIELD

The averaged energy transfer, Eq. (46), can be evaluated without further approximation for an ion motion parallel
to the magnetic ﬁeld and assuming axially symmetric interaction potential, U (k) = U (|kk|, k⊥).
In this case the
averaged energy transfer can be represented as the sum of all cyclotron harmonics. For the parallel motion of the ion,
vi⊥ = 0 and vr =
b = vrkb, where vik and vi⊥ are the components of ion velocity along and transverse to
the magnetic ﬁeld, respectively. In general case setting vi⊥ = 0, we have from Eq. (46)

We recall that for the ion parallel motion the last term in Eq. (7) vanishes, i.e. the relative energy is conserved

For a study of the convergence of the series in Eq. (53) we note that in all terms the modiﬁed Bessel functions In carry
the smaller argument ∝ min(a, s), while the Kn depend on max(a, s). At large harmonic numbers n both the indices
and the arguments of these functions are large, and they behave as In(nξ), Kn(nη). Therefore the case s = a is most
critical for the convergence of (53). This is intuitively clear as the gyrating electron hits the ion on such a trajectory.
This should not matter for the potential (52), which has been regularized near the origin for exactly that purpose.
Since at large n → ∞ and at s = a the summand in Eq. (53) involves the functions In(nx) and Kn(nx) and their
derivatives the further analysis can be done using the uniform asymptotic expansions of the modiﬁed Bessel functions
[20, 21]. Insertion of the expansions shows indeed that the nth member of the series are of the order O(n−4), so the
series converges even for s = a. On the other hand, the energy transfer for the unregularized potentials UC and UD
diverges for s = a.

For the screened but unregularized potential, i.e. in the limit λ → 0, all functions un, Tn, Qn and Dn involving χn

in their arguments tend to zero. There remains

independent of n for n → ∞ and s = a, hence the series diverges. In the Coulomb case, i.e. for λ → ∞, κn = n/δ,
the resulting series are geometric and can be summed in closed form

Because of the symmetry of Eq. (58) in respect to its arguments the limit of a small impact parameter s ≪ δ, is given
by Eqs. (63) and (64) with the roles of a and s interchanged. Similarly from Eq. (53) in the case of the regularized
potential and for vanishing cyclotron radius (ve⊥ = 0) we obtain

Comparing the ﬁrst term in Eq. (63) with Eq. (65) we conclude that the additional modiﬁed Bessel function in Eq. (65)
with the argument χ1s guarantees the convergence of the energy transfer at small impact parameter s.

For the practical applications and for general interaction potential in Appendix A we also performe the s-integration

of the second order energy transfer, Eq. (49).

V. ARBITRARY ION MOTION IN A STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD

After the discussion of the energy loss for an ion moving parallel to a magnetic ﬁeld of arbitrary strength we return to
the general case, where the ion velocity has a component transverse to the ﬁeld. As mentioned above the integrations

and summation in Eq. (46) cannot be done in this case unless other simpliﬁcations are made. In the following we
consider strong magnetic ﬁelds and in Eq. (46) keep only the terms with n = 0, ±1 and expand the remaining Bessel
functions J0(k⊥a) ≃ 1 − (k⊥a)2/4, J1(k⊥a) ≃ k⊥a/2 with respect to the cyclotron radius of electrons. Note that this
approximation can be alternatively formulated as a smallness of the electron transverse velocity ve⊥. We obtain two
contributions to the energy transfer, h∆E(2)
iII which is
proportional to a2. We split h∆E(2)

As in Sec. IV we will assume axially symmetric potentials U (k) = U (|kk|, k⊥). The integration is done by using
cylindrical coordinates oriented along nr = vr/vr, i.e. any vector C will be represented as C = C(r)
⊥ . For
the Bessel functions we use the addition theorem [20]. The angular integrals are trivial as they involve powers of
trigonometric functions. Note that the contribution of the term proportional to the function g3(k, k′) in Eq. (68)
vanishes due to the antisymmetrical behavior of this function with respect to the azymuthal angles of k(r)
⊥ and k′(r)
⊥ .

no harm when integrating over the impact parameter s. This is not so in the case of the screened potential. Insertion
of Eq. (72) at λ → 0 (i.e. χ1 → ∞) into Eq. (69) yields

This is just the stretched helix case considered in Ref. [16]. Equation (76) is the same as the second-order energy
transfer in a ﬁeld-free case (see, e.g., Refs. [11]) but the full relative velocity ur = ve − vi is replaced here by the
relative velocity of the electron guiding center vr.

These results are obtained in the limit a → 0 where the electrons move along their guiding center trajectories.
Moreover, for ωc → ∞ also the pitch δ → 0 and these trajectories are rectilinear along the lines of the magnetic
ﬁeld and the energy transfer is given by h∆E(2)
iI1. For a ﬁnite ωc corresponding to a ﬁnite pitch the contribution

Here κ2
2 = 4/δ2 + 1/λ2, ρ2 = κ2s. The cyclotron motion and the drift of the guiding center of the electron are coupled
to each other. Therefore the perturbation of the cyclotron motion causes an additional perturbation of the guiding
center motion. This eﬀect is given by the ﬁrst term Q0 in Eq. (78) which depends on magnetic ﬁeld through the
cyclotron radius a in the prefactor, while the arguments of the modiﬁed Bessel functions in Eq. (79) do not depend
on magnetic ﬁeld. In the other terms Q1 and Q2 the arguments of the Bessel functions ρ1 and ρ2 correspond to the
ﬁrst and second cyclotron harmonic perturbations, respectively.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have presented a detailed theoretical investigation of the energy transfer of a uniformly moving
heavy ion due to the binary collision (BC) with the magnetized electrons. The BC energy transfer can only be
evaluated explicitly in closed form in the limiting cases of a vanishing and an inﬁnitely strong magnetic ﬁeld. The BC
treatment developed here is valid for arbitrary strengths of the magnetic ﬁeld and arbitrary shapes of the interaction
potential up to second order in the interaction strength. The purpose of this work was to investigate the ion energy
transfer for ﬁnite magnetic ﬁelds which is explicitly calculated for a regularized and screened potential which is both of

ﬁnite range and less singular than the Coulomb interaction at the origin and as the limiting cases involves the Debye
(i.e., screened) and Coulomb potentials. Two particular cases have been considered in detail: (i) Ion motion parallel
to the magnetic ﬁeld with an arbitrary strength. The energy transfer involves all harmonics of the electron cyclotron
motion. (ii) The ion arbitrary motion with respect to the strong magnetic ﬁeld when the electron cyclotron radius
is much smaller than other characteristic length scales (e.g., screening length, pitch of electron helix etc.). We show
that in the latter case the energy transfer receives two contributions which are responsible for the electron guiding
center and cyclotron orbit perturbations.

We would like to mention that our current results leave still some questions open. It is clear that for the validity of
the second–order perturbation BC theory developed here more critical are the domains of the small relative velocities
vr and/or impact parameters s. Moreover, for the binary electron–ion collisions in a magnetic ﬁeld as given by the
equation of motion (6) there are less integrals of motion than degrees of freedom which indicates the possibility of the
chaotic dynamics in the system [12, 13, 14]. This immediately raises the question whether a perturbative treatment
as proposed in this paper can be applied at all. We will address this issue in the fortcoming studies by showing some
examples for the energy transfer obtained from a numerical solution of the equation of motion (6) and by making
some comparison with the perturbative treatment. This topic is presently under investigation and will be published
elsewhere.

APPENDIX A: INTEGRATED ENERGY TRANSFER FOR PARALLEL ION MOTION

The integration of the energy transfer Eq. (49) with Eqs. (50) and (51) with respect to the impact parameter s is

facilitated by using the following relations for the Bessel functions

Jn (k⊥s) Jn (k′

⊥s) sds =

Jn−1 (k⊥s) Jn−1 (k′

⊥s) sds =

δ (k′

⊥ − k⊥) .

As an important particular case consider the regularized and screened interaction potential Eq. (52). For this potential
Eq. (A3) for the function Φn yields [20]

Note that Hn (ξ) = Tn (ξ, ξ), where Tn (x, y) is deﬁned in Eq. (55). From Eq. (A7) one can derive the function Φn
for screened and Coulomb potentials. For the screened but unregularized potential (i.e. λ → 0) all terms in Eq. (A7)
containing χ vanish and the function Φn becomes

Consider the integrated energy transfer for an arbitrary ion motion and for inﬁnitely strong magnetic ﬁeld. The
12 (s) and T01 (s) T03 (s) which can

integration of Eq. (69) with respect to s involves two integrals of the functions T 2
be evaluated employing the relation (A1). In a general case with q 6= 0 we obtain

T (q, κ) =

T 2

T01 (q, s) T03 (q, s) sds =

Obviously the integrations in Eq. (B1) require that the interaction potential must decay faster than r−1 at large
distances and must increase slower than r−1 at small ones. In particular, for regularized screened potential from
Eq. (B1) we ﬁnd

with κ = λ/d = 1 + λ/λ which at q = 0 is simpliﬁed to

T (q, κ) =

Numerical evidence for a ﬁnite-time singularity in ideal
3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is presented. The simula-
tions start from two interlocking magnetic ﬂux rings with no
initial velocity. The magnetic curvature force causes the ﬂux
rings to shrink until they come into contact. This produces
a current sheet between them. In the ideal compressible cal-
culations, the evidence for a singularity in a ﬁnite time tc is
that the peak current density behaves like kJk∞ ∼ 1/(tc − t)
for a range of sound speeds (or plasma betas). For the in-
compressible calculations consistency with the compressible
calculations is noted and evidence is presented that there is
convergence to a self-similar state. In the resistive reconnec-
tion calculations the magnetic helicity is nearly conserved and
energy is dissipated.

To date it is not known whether or not the ideal mag-
netohydrodynamic (MHD) and Euler equations are reg-
ular. Regularity means that for arbitrary smooth initial
data the velocity u and/or magnetic ﬁeld B and all of
its derivatives remain ﬁnite for all times. If regularity is
not established, one cannot rule out the possibility of a
ﬁnite time singularity, which for ideal MHD implies sat-
isfying a new mathematical constraint that the vorticity
ω = ∇ × u and current density J = ∇ × B must obey

for there to be a singularity. The physical signiﬁcance of
a ﬁnite-time singularity is that fast vortex and/or mag-
netic ﬁeld reconnection could be possible once viscous
and resistive eﬀects are restored. A theoretical demon-
stration of a mechanism for fast magnetic reconnection
would be signiﬁcant in a variety of problems in plasma
physics including experimental studies related to magnet-
ically conﬁned fusion [2], dynamos, the earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld and the solar corona, where reconnection is asso-
ciated with ﬂares [3,4] and coronal heating [5,6]. This
letter will show preliminary evidence for a possible sin-
gularity for ideal MHD using numerical simulations of
three-dimensional linked magnetic ﬂux rings and discuss
its relationship to fast magnetic reconnection.

Signiﬁcant progress has been made recently for the Eu-
ler case where a numerical study of a pair of antiparallel
vortex tubes has produced strong evidence for the for-
mation of a singularity in the Euler equations in a ﬁnite
time [7]. The numerical evidence was consistent with an

analytic constraint for Euler [8] that no singularity can
occur in a ﬁnite time t = tc in any quantity (e.g. in any
derivative of u, however high) unless

I(tc) =

kωk∞(t)dt → ∞.

Here k...k∞ is the L∞ norm, or maximum, in space. This
theorem shows that when searching for a singularity in
the 3D Euler equations, the only quantity that needs to
be monitored numerically is kωk∞. Furthermore, if a
singularity of the form kωk∞ ∼ (tc − t)−γ is observed in
a numerical experiment then γ must obey γ ≥ 1 for the
observed singular behavior to be genuine. The numerical
comparisons [7] found γ ≡ 1, a scaling that is consistent
dimensionally in addition to being consistent with (2).
The generalization to MHD is (1).

An important feature of the analysis of the Euler
calculations that should be used when analysing other
ﬂows with possible singularities is that singular behav-
ior should be demonstrated by several independent tests.
One set of tests predicted mathematically is that in addi-
tion to the 1/(tc − t)γ behavior of kωk∞, all components
of k∇uk∞ should diverge as 1/(tc − t)γ [9]. Again, γ ≡ 1
is expected. Another test that was found numerically [7]
is that the rate of enstrophy production is

dΩ/dt =

ωieijωj dV ∼ 1/(tc − t)

where enstrophy is Ω =

|ω|2 dV .
The question of fast magnetic reconnection has been
addressed using both time evolving calculations and
steady-state analyses.
In two-dimensional calculations,
fast reconnection is inhibited by material that cannot
escape easily from between thin current sheets. This
led to early suggestions that a singularity in 2D MHD
is precluded by the formation of current sheets [10] and
is consistent with a recent result that there can be no
singularity at 2D nulls [11]. New experimental evidence
[2] designed to test two-dimensional steady-state theories
shows a slow resistive timescale [12–14] instead of a faster
timescale resulting from slow shocks [15] and related the-
ories [16]. In three dimensions, the extra degree of free-
dom could allow material to escape more readily from
the current sheets. This has prompted reconnection sim-
ulations in three dimensions, for example starting with
orthogonal, straight ﬂux tubes in pressure equilibrium
and a small velocity ﬁeld to push them together [17].

ible gas for a given sound speed cs with a magnetic ﬁeld

ideal limit, the resistivity η and the viscosity µ are set
to zero. The magnetic ﬁeld is measured in units where
the permeability is unity. Periodic boundary conditions
are adopted in a domain of size (2π)3. Our time unit is
the sound travel time over a unit distance. The equa-
tions are advanced in time using a variable third-order
Runge-Kutta timestep and sixth order explicit centered
derivatives in space.

The equations for the incompressible case are the
same except that the equation for ρ is replaced by the
divergence-free condition on velocity ∇ · u to determine
the pressure. The magnetic ﬁeld B, rather than the vec-
tor potential A, is used as a fundamental variable. The
equations are advanced in time using a spectral coloca-
tion method with the 2/3-rule and variable third-order
Runge-Kutta timestep.

energy [19] when µ and ν 6= 0.

The initial conditions used in the present study will all
be of two linked, magnetic ﬂux rings. This condition is
chosen because it has the advantage that no velocity ﬁeld
needs to be imposed in the initial conditions since the
tension from the curvature of the rings induces a velocity
by shrinking the rings. Due to the initial linkage, it also
yields nearly maximal HB and therefore is an excellent
choice for studying the dissipation of HB versus energy
[18].

A variety of diﬀerent ring thicknesses and angles be-
tween the initial rings have been investigated. This letter
will discuss in detail only cases where the rings are or-
thogonal and are just touching. There are three distances
that determine the initial condition that evolved into the
structures in Figure 1. The outer radii of the rings R, the
inner radii or thickness r◦ where the ﬂux goes smoothly
to zero, and the separation of their centers from the ori-
gin ∆x. The separation of the rings is 2(R − ∆x). An
initial proﬁle across the ring that gives |B| = 1 in the
center and goes smoothly to |B| = 0 at r = r◦ is taken
from the Euler calculations [7]. R = 1 and ∆x = 0.5

for all the cases, so that they go through each other’s
centers. The initial condition for the compressible calcu-
lations to be reported used r◦ = 0.5. r◦ = 0.5, 0.65 and
0.8 for the ideal incompressible cases. Following the ex-
ample from the Euler case [7], the following hyperviscous
ﬁlter was applied in Fourier space to the initial condition
only: exp[−(k/kmax)4), where kmax is the order of 14 to
20. As a result, the maximum initial magnetic ﬁeld B0 is
slightly less than one. For the compressible calculations,
cs is varied between 0.1 and 10, so the initial plasma
beta, β0 = 2c2
0, varied between 0.02 and 200. The
initial density was uniform and unity. (Simulations with
s + B2 = const gave similar results, but this
initially ρc2
works only for β0 > 1.)

All of the compressible, resistive calculations were
straightforward runs from t = 0 with viscosities and re-
sistivities chosen for a given resolution. The strategy
for reaching the highest possible resolution for the ideal
calculations followed the example of how a possible sin-
gularity in incompressible Euler was demonstrated [7].
First, the ideal calculations do not contain any numeri-
cal smoothing and have been run only so long as numeri-
cal dissipation was insigniﬁcant. This approach was used
because experience has shown that artiﬁcial smoothing
results in artiﬁcial dissipation which can obscure the dy-
namics of the ideal case. The lower resolution calcula-
tions were started from t = 0. Since it would be too ex-
pensive to run higher resolution calculations from t = 0,
they are being remeshed at intermediate times.

There was no initial velocity ﬁeld. The ﬁrst, and short-
est, phase after initialization was that due to the curva-
ture of the ﬂux rings their diameter R shrinks. This
automatically brings the ﬂux tube rings into contact and
the current of one ring begins to overlap the magnetic
ﬁeld of the other. This is necessary for the Lorentz force
to be signiﬁcant and for a strong interaction to begin.

To give an overall view of the ﬂow, Figure 1 shows
the three-dimensional structure from a β = 0.5, 1923
resistive, compressible calculation, just before and after
the estimated singular time.
t = 2 shows nearly ideal
evolution from the initial motionless, perfectly tubular
ﬂux tubes. The dominant feature is the indentation in
each ring caused by anti-parallel vortex rings that form
on the outer edges of each ﬂux ring from the Lorentz
force. This is because in the cores of the ﬂux rings the
ﬁeld is strongest and the magnetic curvature force largest.
The vortex rings would form even if the rings were not
linked. The region going singular appears in Figure 2a.
as twisted current sheets within the center of Figure 1a.
A surprising property of the reconnection process is that
slices show that the size of the entire structure shrinks.
Some perspective on this can be obtained by comparing
the structures at t = 2 and t = 3, We are beginning
to take advantage of this collapse and move the periodic
boundaries closer to the original ﬂux rings and so eﬀec-
tively increase the local resolution.

after the singular time.

Figure 3 shows 1/kJk∞ and 1/(kJk∞ + kωk∞) for
the resistive calculations. There is a strong tendency
in favor of linear behavior similar to that observed by
3D Euler [7]. Extrapolating from before t = 2.2 to
1/Jmax = 0 suggests that tc ≈ 2.5. For cs > 0.5, that
is more incompressible, roughly the same singular time
would be predicted. For cs < .5, that is more compress-
ible, diﬀerent behavior is indicated, but the trend toward
1/kJk∞ ∼ (tc − t) remains.

FIG. 1. Resistive calculation using compressible code.
t = 2 shows evolution during the nearly ideal phase, t = 3
shows a partially reconnected state with HB converted more
into new twist between the remnants of the original tubes
than into writhe within reconnected tubes.

By t = 3 some reconnection has occurred. Magnetic
helicity HB is nearly conserved, decreasing linearly at
a very slow pace as it is converted into writhe or new
twist, and energy is dissipated more rapidly. Detailed
examination of this structure will be studied elsewhere.

a double saddle surface, which at t = 3 is broken up into two
disjoint pieces.

In a resistive calculation, the dissipation is concen-
trated on a current sheet that forms where the two ﬂux
rings come into contact. Level surfaces of the current
density near its peak value (Fig. 2) show a twisted, sad-
dle shaped, double-sheet structure before the estimated
singular time, which separates into two disjoint sheets

For Euler, recall that stronger evidence for a possible
singularity was obtained by monitoring the L∞ norm for
an additional strain term and the enstrophy production,
as well as kωk∞ [7]. Following that reasoning, we need to
know the behavior of two ﬁrst derivatives of the magnetic
or velocity ﬁelds plus a global production term. There-
fore, we propose looking at the behavior of kJk∞, kωk∞,
and the production of Ωω+J = 1

where eij = 1
2 (Bi,j + Bj,i) are
the hydrodynamic and magnetic strains. The terms in
PΩJ , in order, are the vortex stretching already known for
Euler, a new vorticity production term and a new current
producing term. All three tests should go as 1/(tc − t)
once suﬃciently singular solutions are obtained, which
the present large calculations are, as yet, not. Therefore,
the present objective is trends in the right direction, not
strong evidence for the existence of a singularity.

Figure 4 plots the three proposed tests for the two
highest incompressible resolutions to date. 1923 and 3843
for three initial conditions. Only 1923 is shown for PΩJ .
For r◦ = 0.5, kJk∞ incompressible is comparable to the

compressible case and shows the longest range of (tc − t)
behavior.

FIG. 4. Comparison of the evolution of 1/kJk∞, 1/kωk∞
and PΩJ for three incompressible initial conditions for two
resolutions. a: r◦ = 0.5, this is the most comparable to the
compressible case; b: r◦ = 0.65, this shows the longest range
of self-similarity; c: r◦ = 0.8. d: kωk∞/kJk∞ for r =0.5, 0.65
and 0.8, all of which are converging to kωk∞/kJk∞ ≈ 0.5,
demonstrating possible self-similarity.

In the case of Euler it was shown that ratios of all
L∞ norms of ﬁrst derivatives were approaching constant
values [7], which would be consistent with self-similar
behavior near the point going singular. Therefore we ex-
pect that kωk∞/kJk∞ should approach a constant value
here also. Initially the velocity, and vorticity, are zero,
so these must build up before behavior for kωk∞ and
PΩJ consistent with 1/(tc − t) appears. Figure 4d shows
that all three cases appear to be converging to a value
of kωk∞/kJk∞ ≈ 0.5. r◦ = 0.65 converges the soonest,
near t = 1.6 and is our strongest evidence to date for
a possible singularity in ideal MHD. In addition, 1/PΩJ
appears to join the same (tc − t) near t = 1.9.

While Figure 4d shows that 1/kωk∞ for r◦ = 0.5 does
not, for the period simulated, have the same value for tc
as 1/kJk∞, the r◦ = 0.5 case could still be singular. This
analysis suggests that unlike Euler, vorticity seems to be
playing only a secondary role for ideal MHD. Note that
the production term for J2 in (5), 2εijkJidjℓeℓk, does not
involve vorticity, but only strain terms. It is not essential
that vorticity blow up for the compressible cases, and it
does not. Even for the incompressible cases note that
kJk∞ > kωk∞. Related to this, the current sheets near
kJk∞ in Figure 2 are twisted in a manner that we do
not yet understand and which might have something to
do with why an initial condition that is helical is giving
singular behavior. It also suggests that similar hydrody-
namic initial conditions should be revisited to determine
their reconnection rates [20]. Further analysis of local
production terms in proposed 6003 calculations should
help answer these questions.

In conclusion, we have presented numerical evidence

4

for a ﬁnite-time blow-up of the current density in ideal
MHD in the case of interlocked magnetic ﬂux rings. In
the resistive case one would not expect there to be a
singularity. Instead, arbitrarily thin current sheets will
form, depending on how small the resistivity is [21]. This
can lead to signiﬁcant dissipation whose strength is vir-
tually independent of resistivity. The astrophysical sig-
niﬁcance of current sheets as a consequence of tangential
discontinuities of the ﬁeld has also been stressed in a
recent book by Parker [5]. However, the possibility of
a ﬁnite time singularity in ideal MHD is not commonly
discussed in connection with fast reconnection.

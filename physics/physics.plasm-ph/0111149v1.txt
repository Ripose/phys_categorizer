Evolution of Ultracold, Neutral Plasmas

We present the ﬁrst large-scale simulations of an ultracold,
neutral plasma, produced by photoionization of laser-cooled
xenon atoms, from creation to initial expansion, using classi-
cal molecular dynamics methods with open boundary condi-
tions. We reproduce many of the experimental ﬁndings such
as the trapping eﬃciency of electrons with increased ion num-
ber, a minimum electron temperature achieved on approach
to the photoionization threshold, and recombination into Ry-
dberg states of anomalously-low principal quantum number.
In addition, many of these eﬀects establish themselves very
early in the plasma evolution (∼ ns) before present experi-
mental observations begin.

That a common characteristic connects such diverse
environments as the surface of a neutron star, the initial
compression stage of an inertial conﬁnement fusion cap-
sule, the interaction region of a high-intensity laser with
atomic clusters, and a very cold, dilute, and partially-
ionized gas within an atomic trap, seems at ﬁrst rather
remarkable. Yet all these cases embrace a regime known
as a strongly-coupled plasma. For such a plasma, the in-
teractions among the various constituents dominate the
thermal motions. The plasma coupling constant Γα, the
ratio of the average electrostatic potential energy Zα/aα [
1/3);
Zα, the charge; aα, the ion-sphere radius = 3/(4πnα
and nα, the number density for a given component α]
to the kinetic energy kBTα, provides an intrinsic mea-
sure of this eﬀect [1]. When Γα exceeds unity, vari-
ous strong-coupling eﬀects commence such as collective
modes and phase transitions. For multi-component plas-
mas, the coupling constants need not be equal or even
comparable, leading to a medium that may contain both
strongly- and weakly- coupled constituents.

Since temperatures usually start around a few hundred
Kelvin, most plasmas found in nature or engineered in
the laboratory attain strongly-coupled status from high
densities, as in the case of a planetary interior or a shock-
compressed ﬂuid [2,3], or from highly-charged states, as
in colloidal or “dusty” plasmas [4]. In both situations,
the particle density usually rises well above 1018/cm3.
On the other hand, ion trapping and cooling methods
have produced dilute, strongly-coupled plasmas by rad-
ically lowering the temperature. At ﬁrst, these eﬀorts
were limited to nonneutral plasmas conﬁned by a mag-
netic ﬁeld [5]. However, recently, new techniques [6–9]
have generated neutral, ultracold plasmas, free of any

external ﬁelds at densities of the order of 108-1010/cm3
and temperatures at microkelvins (µK).

Two methods, one direct and one indirect, but both
employing laser excitation of a highly-cooled sample of
neutral atoms, have successfully created such neutral
plasmas. The direct approach employs the photoioniza-
tion of laser-cooled xenon atoms [6–8], while the indirect
generates a cold Rydberg gas in which a few collisions
with room-temperature atoms produces the ionization
[9,10]. In both cases, the electron and ion temperatures
start very far apart with the former from 1K to 1000K
and the latter remaining at the initial atom temperature
of a few µK. This implies that the coupling constant for
the electrons (Γe) ranges between 1 and 10, while the
ions begin with Γi ∼ 1000. Based on the results pre-
sented below, the following picture emerges. As the sys-
tem evolves, the electrons reach a quasi-equilibrium while
at the same time beginning to move the ions through
long-range Coulomb interactions. Eventually, the ions
also heat, and the whole cloud begins to expand with
the ions and electrons approaching comparable temper-
atures. The former processes occur on the order of pico-
to nano- seconds, while the full expansion becomes no-
ticeable on a microsecond scale. Therefore, by following
the progress of the system, we can study not only the
basic properties of a strongly-coupled plasma but also its
evolution through a variety of stages. The path to equi-
libration still remains a poorly understood process for
strongly-coupled plasmas in general.

The dilute character of the ultracold plasmas pro-
vides a unique opportunity to explore the intricate nature
of atomic-scale, strongly-coupled systems, both through
real-time imaging of the sample to study wave phenom-
ena, collective modes, and even phase transitions, and
through laser probes to examine internal processes. The
initial experiments have already discovered unexpected
phenomena such as more rapid than expected ion ex-
pansion [7] and Rydberg populations that strongly de-
viate from those predicted from standard electron-ion
recombination rates [8,11–13]. So far, the experiments
have examined the later expansion stage of the whole
plasma cloud, which occurs on the scale of microseconds.
However, the nature of the plasma at this stage depends
strongly on its evolution from its creation. While ultra-
fast laser techniques oﬀer the eventual prospect of prob-
ing these early times, for now, only simulations can pro-
vide an understanding of the full evolution of these sys-
tems. We focus on the ﬁrst such generated plasma [6]
from the photoionization of cold Xenon atoms; however,

the ﬁndings also provide insight into other ultracold sys-
tems.

Since the electron temperature greatly exceeds the
Fermi temperature for this system, we may eﬀectively
employ a two-component classical molecular dynamics
(MD) approach in which the electrons and ions are
treated as distinguishable particles, interacting through a
modiﬁed Coulomb potential. We have employed several
diﬀerent forms from an ab-initio Xe+ + e− pseudopoten-
tial [14] to a simple eﬀective cut-oﬀ potential [15] based
on the de Broglie thermal wavelengths; we found little
sensitivity of the basic properties to this choice. This
ﬁnding stems from the dominance of the interactions by
the very long-range Coulomb tails since the average par-
ticle separations are of the order of 104˚A(1 to 2 times the
de Broglie wavelength for electrons at a temperature of
0.1K). The short-range modiﬁcation of the Coulomb po-
tential basically prevents particles with opposite charges
from collapsing into a singularity. Due to the open and
nonperiodic boundary conditions, sample size eﬀects can
play a critical role in the simulations [16]. Therefore, we
must employ particle numbers of the basic order of the
experiments, requiring eﬃcient procedures for handling
the long-range forces. In addition, the extended simula-
tion times needed to model the entire plasma evolution
[fs to µs] demand eﬀective temporal treatments. To this
end, we have employed multipole-tree procedures [17] in
conjunction with reversible reference system propagator
algorithms [18] (r-RESPA) through the parallel 3D MD
program NAMD [19], generally used in biophysical ap-
plications. These procedures allow us to treat samples of
between 102 and 104 particles [N = Ni/2 = Ne/2]; most
simulations were performed with N = 103.

To reproduce the initial experimental conditions [6], we
distribute the ions randomly according to a 3D Gaussian,
whose rms radius, σ, matches the desired ion number
density ni [ni = Ni/(2πσ2)3/2] and impose a Maxwell-
Boltzmann velocity distribution at Ti = 1µK. To each
ion, we associate an electron placed randomly in an orbit
of radius ro= 50˚A. The electron velocities point in ran-
dom directions but with ﬁxed magnitude, determined by
e ≡ 1
the photoionization condition [Ki
e = ¯hω − 1/ro,
with ω, the laser frequency and v2
e as a sum over all three
spatial components]. This idealized prescription models
the photoionization process by allowing each electron to
escape the Coulomb well with a ﬁnal prescribed energy.
By varying the laser frequency, we can control the ﬁnal
eﬀective electron temperature, just as in the experiments.
We tested this particular ionization model against simu-
lations where both the initial electron-ion radius ro and
the form of the ion distribution are varied. Overall, we
ﬁnd little sensitivity to these variations on the basic ini-
tial conditions. Finally, we take a kinematic deﬁnition
of temperature as the average kinetic energy per parti-
cle Tα = 1
α,i, where the sum runs over all
particles i of type α.

The plasma evolves through several stages. In the ﬁrst
or photoionization stage, which lasts on the order of fs,
the electrons climb out of the Coulomb well and become
basically freely-moving particles. In the next stage, the
electrons reach a quasi-equilibrium at Te due to their
fast intra-particle collisions. Following this stage, the
electron-ion collisions begin the slow process of heating
the ions, which can require up to µs. This process can
also be viewed in terms of an electron pressure term in a
hydrodynamical formulation [7]. Then, the whole cloud
of ions and electrons begins a systematic expansion. This
progression clearly evinces itself in Fig. 1, which shows
the temporal behavior of electron and ion average kinetic
energies, using an eﬀective mass for the ion of mi = 0.01
amu in order to accelerate the evolutionary process. The
averaged kinetic energy of the electrons and ion become
comparable and the cloud perceptibly expands in about
mXe
20 ns. Scaling this value by
mi yields an estimate for
this time in a Xe plasma of about 1µs, in line with the
q
experiments [6]. Also consistent with the experimental
measurements [7], these preliminary calculations indicate
that a large fraction of the kinetic energy transferred by
the electrons results in outward translational motion for
the ions. This implies that the kinetic temperature de-
ﬁned above coincides with the usual themodynamic tem-
perature (random thermal motion) for the electrons only.
In all other simulations discussed, the ions carry the mass
of Xe.

Since we shall use the simulations to understand in-
termediate stages in the development of the ultracold
plasma, we need to establish the validity of the procedure
by comparing to experiments. Two initial observations
have particular signiﬁcance: 1) the number of trapped
electrons rises with the number of ions created for a ﬁxed
ﬁnal temperature, and 2) the electrons attain a certain
minimum temperature no matter how small ¯hω becomes.
Figure 2a shows that the number of trapped electrons
as a function of the number of ions and initial electron

temperature basically follows the general experimental
trends [6]. Some of the electrons, freed by the photoion-
ization process from ions with suﬃcient energy, escape
the atomic cloud and never return, leaving an overall
positively charged system. This residual charge then ef-
fectively traps the remaining electrons so that the cen-
ter of the distribution resembles a neutral plasma. The
larger the number of ions produced, the more eﬀective
the conﬁnement of the electrons.

In Fig.2b, we present for ni=4.32x109 ions/cm3, the
electron temperature Tf
e after the initial equilibration in
the simulations as a function of the excess initial temper-
ature Ti
e] given to the electrons during the pho-
toionization process. The plateau at about 5K [Γe ∼ 1]
for small Ti
e appears quite pronounced. This eﬀect arises
due to a mechanism usually designated as “continuum
lowering” [1]. Despite the small energies and enormous
distances involved, at least by usual atomic standards,
the interaction of an ion with its neighbors still has a no-
ticeable eﬀect due to the very long-range of the Coulomb
potential. This shifts the appropriate zero of energy from
the isolated atom to the whole system. Using a simple
binary interaction, we can estimate this energy diﬀer-
ence for an electron halfway between the ions [∼ 2/aion]
at around 3K for this density, in qualitative agreement
with the simulations. Even for a photon energy near the
atomic threshold, the electron within the plasma will still
gain this minimum energy. This same eﬀect also explains
the dependence of the ﬁnal electron temperature on the
ion density. In this situation, an increase in the ion den-
sity enhances the zero of energy shift and leads to an
increase in the ﬁnal electron temperature.

experiments [7] have used this quantity as an indirect
means of deducing the density of the ultracold plasma.
Given the nature of the system with open boundary con-
ditions and quasi-equilibration among the electrons, the
question arises as to whether fe has a precise deﬁnition.
Neglecting temperature dependence, the electron plasma
frequency is given by

fe =

2π s

e2ne

where e is the elementary charge, ne the electron den-
sity, and me the electron mass. From the MD simula-
tions, the electron plasma frequency is obtained from the
Fourier transform of the electron velocity autocorrela-
tion function [20]. We ﬁnd, reassuringly, that a distinct
though broadened peak arises near the fe predicted by
Eq.1 in the regime in which the electrons reach a quasi-
equilibration. For example, at a density of 4.32x1010
ions/cm3, an electron temperature of 3K, and simula-
tion time extending up to 18ns, MD gives plasma fre-
quencies of 1.2GHz (1.4 GHz) while Eq.1 yields 1.57GHz
(1.87GHz) for trapped electrons at 70% (100%) of the ion
density. When the ion density is decreased to a value of
4.32x109 ions/cm3 at the same electron temperature, fe
from the MD simulations becomes 0.5Ghz, also in accor-
dance with Eq.1 . In general, we ﬁnd that the number of
particles used in the simulation cell has little eﬀect on the
determination of the electron plasma frequency beyond
providing a better statistical sample.

The molecular dynamics simulations yield additional
properties of the ultracold plasma. We paid particu-
lar attention to the electron plasma frequency fe since

We now turn to the nature of the constituents as the
plasma evolves and pay particular attention to the for-
mation of Rydberg atoms as noted in the experiments

[8–10]. To this end, we examine over space and time
the ion-electron pair correlation function gie(r), which
gives the probability of ﬁnding an electron a distance r
from a reference ion [15]. To enhance the examination of
the closer encounters, we have employed a modiﬁed form
Gie(r) by subtracting a uniform distribution and aver-
aging gie(r) over a small time interval of 1.5 ns. Figure
3 displays Gie(r) for two representative cases. The open
boundary conditions, which force the distribution to zero
at some large distance, give Gie(r) a distinctly diﬀerent
behavior than seen in a ﬂuid or periodic system.

Figures 3(a)-(c) display the development of a plasma
for ni=4.32x1010 ions/cm3 and Te ∼ 10K in the regime in
which the electrons have reached quasi-equilibration and
the ions have started to heat. After 2.5ns, the electron
distribution departs from its initial form, especially be-
yond a radius of 10000˚A. By 8.5ns, we begin to observe an
increase in Gie just below 1000˚A. This signiﬁes the forma-
tion of Rydberg states in an average principal quantum
number n ∼ 40, a conclusion supported by an examina-
tion of movies of the simulation. These movies also show
stable Rydberg atom conﬁgurations over many orbital
periods of the electrons. A simple model [13] that bal-
ances various collisional processes, using strictly atomic
cross sections, predicts a much larger value (n ≥ 100).
For conditions closer to the experimental measurements
(lower density), as depicted in Figs. 3(d)-(f), we ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant Rydberg population after only 20ns (Fig.3f).
The electron distribution shifts to around 2000˚A, corre-
sponding to a principal quantum number n ∼ 60. In both
cases, the Rydberg population is estimated to be between
5% and 10 % of the total number of electrons. These
ﬁndings closely resemble those of the experiments [8],
though for later times (∼ µs) and indicate that collective
or density eﬀects may play an important role by changing
the accessible Rydberg-level distribution or cross sections
through long-range interactions. By examining the elec-
tron mean square displacement over time, we can identify
two stages in the evolution of the cold ionized gas. First,
after the ionization of the atoms, the electrons diﬀuse
throughout the system for several nanoseconds with no
signiﬁcant Rydberg atom formation. Second, the elec-
trons reach the edge of the cloud and begin systematic
multiple traverses of the system. The Rydberg atom pop-
ulation becomes noticeable only several nanoseconds into
this second stage. The feature that attracts the most in-
terest is the relatively short time scale required to estab-
lish the neutral plasma and produce a noticeable Rydberg
population.

In summary, we have followed the evolution of an ul-
tracold, neutral plasma over a broad range of tempo-
ral stages with classical molecular dynamics simulation
techniques. We ﬁnd general agreement with experimen-
tal observations of the number of trapped electrons, the
minimum of electron temperature, and the production of
Rydberg atoms in low-lying states. The latter two con-

ditions especially demonstrate the importance of strong-
coupling or density eﬀects on the basic atomic inter-
actions.
In addition, we have found that the electron
plasma frequency appears as a valid tool to probe the
state of the system. Important to the understanding of
the temporal development of these plasmas, we discov-
ered that recombination and the formation of long-lived
Rydberg states occur rapidly on the order of nanosec-
onds. Our studies continue in an eﬀort to push into the
fully expanded regime by using hydrodynamical methods
tied to the molecular dynamics.

A modiﬁed version of the Plasma Beat-Wave Accelerator scheme is introduced and analyzed,
which is based on autoresonant phase-locking of the nonlinear Langmuir wave to the slowly chirped
beat frequency of the driving lasers via adiabatic passage through resonance. This new scheme is
designed to overcome some of the well-known limitations of previous approaches, namely relativis-
tic detuning and nonlinear modulation or other non-uniformity or non-stationarity in the driven
Langmuir wave amplitude, and sensitivity to frequency mismatch due to measurement uncertainties
and density ﬂuctuations and inhomogeneities. As in previous schemes, modulational instabilities
of the ionic background ultimately limit the useful interaction time, but nevertheless peak electric
ﬁelds at or approaching the wave-breaking limit seem readily attainable. Compared to traditional
approaches, the autoresonant scheme achieves larger accelerating electric ﬁelds for given laser inten-
sity, or comparable ﬁelds for less laser power; the plasma wave excitation is much more robust to
variations or uncertainties in plasma density; it is largely insensitive to the precise choice of chirp
rate, provided only that chirping is suﬃciently slow; and the quality and uniformity of the resulting
plasma wave and its suitability for accelerator applications may be superior. In underdense plasmas,
the total frequency shift required is only of the order of a few percent of the laser carrier frequency,
and for possible experimental proofs-of-principle, the scheme might be implemented with relatively
little additional modiﬁcation to existing systems based on either solid-state ampliﬁers and Chirped
Pulse Ampliﬁcation techniques, or, with somewhat greater technological eﬀort, using a CO2 or other
gas laser system.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

The Plasma Beat-Wave Accelerator (PBWA) was ﬁrst proposed by Tajima and Dawson (TD) [1] as
an alternative to the short-pulse Laser Wake-Field Accelerator (LWFA), based on earlier analysis of
beat-wave excitation as a plasma probe [2] or as a mechanism for plasma heating [2, 3, 4]. Subsequently
the PBWA concept has been studied extensively theoretically, numerically, and experimentally [5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. (For a review, see [19].) In the original scheme, two laser
ﬁelds co-propagating in an underdense plasma are detuned from each other by a frequency shift close to
the electron plasma frequency, so that the modulated envelope resulting from the beating between the
two laser ﬁelds can act ponderomotively on the plasma electrons to resonantly excite a large-amplitude,
high-phase-velocity plasma wave suitable for particle acceleration.

For a ﬁxed beat frequency, performance of the PBWA is constrained by what is now known as the
Rosenbluth-Liu (RL) limit, after the pioneering study in [4]. As the plasma wave amplitude grows,
relativistic detuning eﬀects eventually prevent further growth of the peak longitudinal electric ﬁeld Ez
beyond a maximum value ERL, which, for any realistic laser and plasma parameters, lies below the cold,
non-relativistic, one-dimensional (1D), wave-breaking limit E0 [20, 21]:

is the relativistic kinematic factor associated with the phase-velocity vp of the excited plasma wave,
approximately equal to the characteristic group velocity ¯vg (to be precisely deﬁned below) associated
with the envelope of the beating lasers, both of which will be nearly equal to the speed of light c
for suﬃciently underdense plasmas. (Large thermal spreads increase particle trapping and lower this
threshold for wave-breaking, as discussed in [22, 23, 24].)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

It is not diﬃcult to see the origin of this detuning eﬀect. The eﬀective nonlinear plasma frequency, in
the presence of the laser drive and a plasma wave, is approximately given by

ωpNL ≈ (cid:0)

1 + δn/n0
√γRMS

ωp,

(cid:1)

where δn is an average density perturbation associated with the plasma wave, and γRMS is the root-mean-
square relativistic factor of the electrons, including eﬀects of both the transverse quiver in laser ﬁelds and
the longitudinal velocity imparted by the Langmuir wave itself. Except for highly nonlinear situations
where ponderomotive blow-out becomes important, the average density perturbation is typically small,
and will be neglected here. The RMS transverse quiver velocity is roughly constant for the ﬁxed-
amplitude driving lasers typical of PBWA, but as the longitudinal motion of the perturbed electrons
associated with the excited Langmuir wave becomes even weakly relativistic, γRMS will begin to increase,
causing ωpNL to decrease. Because of the sensitivity of resonance phenomena, γRMS need not grow much
before this resonance shift severely limits the eﬃcacy of the driving beat-wave. As this dynamical
process is eﬀectively reversible, if the detuning occurs before wave-breaking or other phase-mixing or
dissipative eﬀects, then the ponderomotively excited Langmuir wave is not actually saturated per se at
some ﬁxed value given by the RL limit, but exhibits a slow (compared to the plasma frequency) nonlinear
modulation or beating of the wave amplitude, periodically peaking near the maximum value predicted
by RL and then decreasing, as energy is exchanged between the Langmuir wave and the laser ﬁelds.

Tang, Sprangle, and Sudan (TSS) [7, 8] pointed out that one can, in principle, achieve somewhat higher
amplitudes than that predicted by the RL limit by simply detuning the beat frequency to a value
somewhere below the linear plasma frequency, matching the drive frequency to the nonlinear plasma
frequency for some non-trivial plasma wave amplitude. However, McKinstrie and Forslund [25] noted
fundamental practical diﬃculties with this approach. For downward detunings at or beyond some small
critical frequency shift, multiple solutions to the envelope equations appear, and the high-amplitude
branch cannot be accessed reliably from the initially quiescent plasma state, especially in the presence of
any small amount of damping. For suﬃciently small detunings, moderate improvement over the RL limit
is possible, but typically with peak amplitudes still lying below even the cold linear wave-breaking limit.
Furthermore, as the detuning grows in magnitude toward this critical value, the excitation becomes
increasingly non-monotonic, and the time needed to reach the peak amplitude increases and becomes
comparable to the time-scales for ion modulational or decay instabilities that degrade the coherence of
the plasma wave together with its utility for accelerator applications.

Matte et al. (MMEBP) [26] suggested the use of a plasma with a time-varying density, carrying out the
beat-wave excitation during the actual ionization process, when the free electron density is growing. The

3

increase in plasma density can then compensate for the increase in γRMS, and thus the eﬀective plasma
resonance may be maintained with a ﬁxed driving beat frequency for a longer time. However, in order
to yield appreciable improvement, such an approach would require impractically precise timing of lasers
and some means to control the ionization rate, matching it, at least roughly, to the expected growth rate
of the plasma wave. The usual method involving laser-induced ﬁeld ionization leads to cross sections
which are exponentially sensitive to the laser intensity and is therefore unsuitable for such an approach.

Better still, Deutsch, Meerson, and Golub (DMG) [27] suggested incorporating compensatory time-
dependence into the drive lasers rather than in the plasma density. They proposed to partially overcome
the relativistic detuning eﬀect by using a chirped beat-wave excitation scheme, where the frequencies
of one or more of the laser pulses are chirped downward starting from the linear resonance so as to
compensate for the change in the nonlinear frequency of the growing plasma wave, ideally allowing
amplitudes approaching the nonlinear wave-breaking limit. The nonlinear modulations are thereby
reduced but not eliminated, consisting of a ringing about some non-zero saturation value rather than a
full beating as in the original (RL/TD) scheme.

Chirping too fast will cause the plasma oscillations to detune before they have a chance to grow much,
while chirping too slowly appears to result in a slow, highly non-monotonic (ringing) excitation, where
the long interaction times required to build up suﬃcient amplitude (on the order of a few ion plasma
periods) can allow instabilities of the ionic background to grow and disrupt the coherence of the plasma
wave [13, 28]. Intuitively, one expects for the DMG approach that there exists an optimal intermediate
chirp rate, or in fact even an entire optimal chirp proﬁle, in which the driving beat frequency starts at
the linear plasma resonance, where the initial coupling is strongest, and then self-consistently matches
the instantaneous frequency to the detuning caused by the expected growth of the plasma wave.

However, solving such a complicated nonlinear control problem so as to exactly match the nonlinear
plasma frequency with the laser chirp, with the help of either numerical simulation or experimental
calibration, would be both computationally daunting and experimentally impractical. The linear plasma
frequency will be imperfectly known in practice, and even if it were obtained, the instantaneous value of
the nonlinear plasma frequency actually depends on the initial absolute phase of the plasma wave, which
is determined by the exact initial conditions of the plasma and the initial beat phase of the driving lasers,
which are not normally controlled. However, DMG argue that such extrinsic frequency matching is not
actually necessary, and that entrainment can be achieved without recourse to carefully-tailored pulses
or to external feedback. They invoke the nonlinear dynamical phase-locking phenomenon known as
autoresonance [29, 30], arguing that as long as the chirp is suﬃciently slow (compared to the time-scales
for the nonlinear growth and modulation described by RL) and in the right direction (namely, downward
in frequency), then the externally forced, nonlinear dynamical system can self-adjust and automatically
maintain approximately the desired phase entrainment between the driven wave and the ponderomotive
drive, resulting in in an average increase in the oscillation amplitude.

However, proposed as it was before the understanding of autoresonance had matured, especially with
regard to the threshold behavior for establishing and maintaining entrainment and the importance of the
initial detuning, the DMG scheme sometimes fails to produce appreciable phase-locking. This is largely
due to its prescription of beginning the chirp on resonance, and becomes particularly problematic if the
plasma density is imperfectly known or subject to shot-to-shot jitter, when it can lead to nonuniform
growth or early saturation. In fact, there appears to be some uncertainty in the original description of
the scheme [27] as to exactly how autoresonant the proposed excitation mechanism is, as to whether or
to what extent “the precise form of the time-dependence of the frequency is inessential” or else there
“exists an optimal chirp rate that provides the highest excitation rate.”

In fact the DMG chirped scheme can often achieve higher longitudinal electric ﬁelds than the original
(RL/TD) approach, but does not do so universally or robustly, and cannot always produce ﬁelds ap-
proaching even the linear wave-breaking limit for experimentally accessible parameter values. The peak
amplitude and spatio-temporal uniformity of the ﬁnal plasma wave may be sensitive to the exact chirp
rate, to the initial detuning, and most especially to the precise value of the plasma frequency, which,
once again, often is imperfectly known or subject to signiﬁcant variation, due to limited measurement
precision, to shot-to-shot jitter, or to single-shot density ﬂuctuations.

Informed by more recent results, we propose a novel variant of the chirped plasma PBWA concept
which also exploits autoresonance, but enhanced via Adiabatic Passage Through Resonance (APTR)

4

[31, 32, 33]. Rather than chirping downward from the linear resonance, we actually start, counter to
naive intuition, with a frequency shift well above the resonance, and then slowly sweep the beat frequency
through and below resonance. With this approach, when starting from a quiescent plasma, the ﬁnal
state of the plasma wave is insensitive to the exact chirp history, and the excitation is more robust
with respect to imprecise characterization of the plasma density, or actual shot-to-shot ﬂuctuation of the
density or single-shot variation in it, provided only that the spatio-temporal scales of variability are long
compared to the frequency and wavenumber of the plasma wave, and the relative range of ﬂuctuation
or uncertainty is not too large. The chirp rate need not be matched a priori to any anticipated rate
of growth in the plasma wave or resulting rate of relativistic detuning, but must only be chosen to
be suﬃciently slow so as to satisfy a certain adiabatic trapping condition and thereby ensure phase-
locking. Because of the nonlinear nature of the ponderomotive forcing in the relativistic regime, this
adiabaticity condition becomes increasingly diﬃcult to maintain as the wave amplitude grows, and for
a constant chirp rate eventually the plasma wave would fall out of phase-locking with the drive. This
leads to a true saturation in amplitude, with signiﬁcantly less of the undesirable ringing seen in the
original RL/TD scheme. Before the onset of saturation, the frequency of the excited plasma wave can
be closely entrained to the instantaneous beat frequency of the drivers, and the overall phase can remain
reasonably entrained as well, while the plasma wave amplitude monotonically grows to automatically
and self-consistently adjust itself to the monotonically decreasing beat frequency.

Not only is our excitation scheme more robust, so too is our method of analysis. The Lagrangian ﬂuid
formalism developed by RL and then used by DMG employs a power series expansion which is valid
only for weakly relativistic motion in both the transverse and longitudinal directions, thereby limiting
its domain of applicability to laser ﬁelds of suﬃciently low intensity (implying non-relativistic quiver
motion), and to excited plasma waves of suﬃciently low amplitude (with electric ﬁelds well below wave-
breaking). Therefore their equations of motion become increasingly untrustworthy precisely in the regime
of interest, where the plasma wave amplitude grows to some appreciable fraction of the wave-breaking
value E0. Here, we instead employ a fully nonlinear, Eulerian ﬂuid model that allows for arbitrarily
relativistic electron motion below the nonlinear wave-breaking limit EWB, similar to that discussed in
[19, 34] for general laser-plasma interactions and in [11] for PBWA investigations, and also to a pioneering
treatment in [20]. In the weakly relativistic limit, this Eulerian approach can be shown to agree exactly
with the Lagrangian treatment of RL.

This analytical ﬂuid model, and the various physical assumptions which go into it, are discussed in
Section II. In order to treat the autoresonant nature of the problem more easily and transparently, we
re-formulate the dynamical equations in a fully Hamiltonian form in Section III. In Section IV, we use
this canonical formalism to analyze the autoresonant aspects of the beat-wave excitation, from the initial
linear phase-locking regime through the weakly and strongly nonlinear trapped phases to non-adiabatic
saturation. In Section V, we discuss features of some realistic examples relevant for possible experimental
implementation and investigation. Section VI summarizes our preliminary assessment of the merits and
limits of our autoresonant PBWA, especially in comparison to other beat-wave approaches. We then
oﬀer brief conclusions from our initial investigation and prospects for future study in Section VII.

II. FUNDAMENTAL EQUATIONS

Our study of wake excitation is based on an approximate, but convenient and widely-used model. The
plasma is treated as a cold, collisionless, fully relativistic electron ﬂuid moving in a stationary, neutral-
izing, ionic background, coupled to electromagnetic ﬁelds governed by Maxwell’s equations. We restrict
our analysis to one-dimensional (1D) geometry, where all dynamical quantities depend only on the lon-
gitudinal position z and the time t, and we assume a completely homogeneous and initially quiescent
ω1, ω2.
background state of the plasma. The plasma is assumed to be highly underdense, i.e., ωp ≪
In addition, we assume prescribed laser ﬁelds, neglecting throughout the entire interaction any changes
to the laser envelopes due to linear eﬀects such as diﬀraction or group-velocity dispersion, or any non-
linear back-action of the plasma on the lasers such as depletion, self-focusing, photon acceleration due
to ionization or density variation, as well as Raman scattering, self-modulation, and other instabilities
[35, 36]. This model, although simpliﬁed, nevertheless reveals the essential features of autoresonance
and its potential advantages for the PBWA. Possible extensions to more realistic models, as well as some

arguments for the validity of our general results beyond the strict applicability of this model, especially
in the light of density ﬂuctuations, are discussed in Sec. VI and Sec. VII.

The cold, collisionless ﬂuid treatment assumes that the electron temperature is suﬃciently small so
that: the thermal energy kBTe is negligible compared to the typical kinetic energy associated with the
transverse quiver motion in the driving laser ﬁelds; thermal corrections to the Langmuir dispersion
relation are small, which, for waves with relativistic phase velocities simply requires that kBTe is much
smaller than the electron rest energy mc2; and collisional damping of the laser ﬁelds is small over the
interaction time, as are Landau and collisional damping of the excited plasma wave. Neglect of ion
dynamics is strictly valid provided the time-scale for ion motion, typically of the order of a few times

Now, we further make the Quasi-Static Approximation (QSA) (see, e.g., [11] and [37]), wherein we
assume ρ = ρ(ξ) and β = β(ξ), i.e., that the plasma response is independent of time τ in the co-moving
frame, implying that the plasma wave itself moves without dispersion at the ﬁxed average group velocity
βp of the driving lasers. The QSA also speciﬁcally requires that any distortion or change in the shape of
the laser envelope remains negligible during the typical interaction time with any one transverse slice of
plasma, which will be O(T ). This constraint is satisﬁed automatically in our model, since we have already
assumed that laser envelope evolution is negligible throughout the entire interaction, which is of duration
O(T + L/c), where L is the total plasma length. In the QSA, all τ derivatives in equations describing the
plasma response can then be neglected, and the continuity equation (11) can be immediately integrated,
yielding, for our quiescent initial conditions,

III. HAMILTONIAN FORMALISM

To study autoresonance, we now develop the Hamiltonian formulation of (43). Our goal is an expression
in terms of canonical action-angle variables, for which the phase-locking phenomenon is most readily
analyzed. First, note that the dynamical equation for the electrostatic potential (43) can be derived
from the Hamiltonian

the plasma-wave dynamics are seen to be analogous to those of a one-dimensional forced nonlinear os-
H0 of (44) represents the Hamiltonian of the free oscillator, involving one term

2 p2 analogous to the kinetic energy of the oscillator (which is in fact proportional to the electro-
T
static potential energy density of the plasma wave), and another term corresponding to an anharmonic
eﬀective potential
− H0(φ, p)
corresponds to the time-dependent forcing of the oscillator. This forcing is external in that it depends
on a prescribed function of ξ, but because of the nature of the relativistic nonlinearity, the eﬀective
strength of this forcing depends on both the intensity of the driving lasers and the instantaneous value
of the dynamical variable φ associated with the excitation. Because of the ponderomotive nature of the
coupling, the eﬀective forcing is always positive, i.e., includes a constant as well as a purely oscillatory
part. Both of these features diﬀer somewhat from previously-studied autoresonant systems, and will
have important implications for the dynamics.

Up to this point, no approximations have been made in the canonical transformations to the action-angle
variables of the unforced oscillator. Now, we make the Single Resonance Approximation (SRA) [39] to
(45), by assuming that the rapidly oscillating terms of the Hamiltonian average to zero and contribute
negligibly to the dynamics. Anticipating the developments of Section IV, we realize that under certain

follows that of the driving beat frequency of the wave, Ω(ξ)

IV. AUTORESONANT RESPONSE

The essential ingredients for autoresonance, as exploited in the present scheme, are: a nonlinear, oscilla-
tory degree of freedom (in our case, the plasma wave) evolving, in the absence of any forcing, within an
integrable region of phase space; a continuous functional relationship between the nonlinear frequency
and energy of the oscillation, possessing a well-deﬁned linear limit; an applied oscillatory driving force
(in our case, the modulated ponderomotive envelope of the lasers) which is suﬃciently small as to be
considered perturbative, so that the notion of the nonlinear frequency of the unforced oscillator re-
mains meaningful; and initial conditions and forcing proﬁle consistent with Adiabatic Passage Through
Resonance (APTR) – namely, an initially unexcited system (quiescent plasma), and an initial drive
frequency suﬃciently far from the linear resonance, with subsequent time-dependence that is suﬃciently
slowly-varying but otherwise arbitrary.

The key consequence of the autoresonant beat-wave generation is the robust entrainment between the
three relevant (normalized) frequencies: the beat frequency ∆ω(ξ) of the driving lasers, the instantaneous
frequency Ω(ξ) of the driven plasma wave, and the nonlinear frequency Ω(H) of the unforced plasma
wave. Assuming this phase-locking is achieved, amplitude control of the plasma wave can be simply
understood via (50): because the frequency of the freely-evolving nonlinear plasma wave is a function
of the energy, phase-locking of the driven wave to the envelope such that ∆ω(ξ)
Ω(H) implies
that changing the drive frequency will correspondingly change the oscillator energy. In our case, (50)
indicates that Ω(H) is a decreasing function of the energy, so that in order to increase the plasma

Ω(ξ)

12

(58a)

(58b)

(59)

wave amplitude one must decrease the beat frequency as a function of the co-moving position ξ (or,
equivalently, in time t at the source of the driving lasers.)

While we have indicated how autoresonance can lead to large plasma waves, we have not yet shown
under what conditions such phase-locking occurs. To answer this question, we ﬁrst consider the linear
and weakly nonlinear response, valid up to the point where the normalized sweeping drive frequency is of
∆ω(ξ) & 1. Next, we consider the fully nonlinear
the order of the normalized linear resonance, Ω(H)
case, for which we derive adiabaticity requirements for autoresonance.

which is shifted from the bare value ωp due to the transverse quiver motion of the electrons in the
applied laser ﬁelds. While we never explicitly invoked any small a2 approximation, only the leading-order
correction appears because, in making the SRA, we ignored terms of the form ¯a2einθ for
1. But for
suﬃciently large intensity ¯a2 such terms can appreciably eﬀect the motion despite being oﬀ-resonance.
One could, a posteriori, partially correct for this defect by replacing (1
in
the equation of motion (58a), but this will be unnecessary for the small values of ¯a considered here.
Physically, we should simply ensure that the drive frequency begins suﬃciently far above, and then is
slowly swept past, the eﬀective (or renormalized) frequency ωpeff , rather than the bare frequency ωp,
if the diﬀerence is not negligible. Precise knowledge of the exact value of the eﬀective linear plasma
resonance including the eﬀects of transverse quiver is not needed.

the simple harmonic oscillator equations (58) have analytic solutions in terms of the Fresnel Sine and
Cosine integrals [40]. We brieﬂy summarize the extensive characterization of these solutions found in
[31]. When the drive is ﬁrst applied far from resonance, the oscillator response can be divided into two
components: one ringing component precisely at ωpeff , and the other at the driving frequency ∆ω(0),
1/2 in (58a) allows for a large change in phase at small
both of small amplitude. The singular term
amplitude without violating the requirement that φ(ξ) remain smooth, so that the response at the driven
frequency can adjust itself to the drive, and phase-locking can occur. As the frequency is swept toward
the resonance, these driven, phase-locked oscillations grow. Meanwhile, the response at the resonant
frequency has no such phase relation with the drive, and remains small. In this way, we essentially have
one growing, phase-locked plasma wave when the drive frequency reaches the resonant frequency.

As the resonance is approached, the amplitude of the plasma wave begins to become large and one
must account for the growing nonlinearities. We therefore expand the expression for the free nonlinear

still obtain high amplitude plasma waves. We demonstrate the sensitivity of this critical behavior for
ǫ = 0.005 in Fig. 1, which plots numerical solutions to the full quasi-static equation of motion (43). Plot

B. Fully Nonlinear Autoresonant Response

If phase-locking is maintained through the weakly nonlinear regime, the amplitude continues to grow
and one must consider further nonlinearities beyond those included in (63). In this case, there arises

more stringent restrictions on the chirp rate for adiabatic phase-locking to persist. We calculate this

(ξ). These oscillations correspond to ﬂuctuations in Ψ about its (slowly-varying)
I
phase-locked value ¯Ψ = ¯Ψ(ξ), an example of which can be seen in Fig. 1(b). In the autoresonant case
(solid line), we see that as the plasma wave is excited, its frequency does indeed make small oscillations
about the drive frequency. We further note that as one decreases the chirp rate α from its critical value
αc, we obtain more total oscillations in frequency over the longer excitation time, but with a slightly
smaller magnitude of excursions from the drive frequency.

Using the form (68) for the action, the lowest-order equation for the phase is identical to (67), with
I0. In this way, the phase itself is seen to obey a nonlinear oscillator
I
equation, with an eﬀective nonlinear damping (or anti-damping) term, and a conservative “forcing,”
described by the terms in the braces, which is derivable from an eﬀective “potential” (not to be confused
I0 and
with any previously-mentioned potential) whose shape is dictated by the slowly-evolving action
the drive parameters ǫ and α. Phase-locking then corresponds to trapping of Ψ in a basin of this
eﬀective potential. In order for the phase Ψ to be trapped about some value ¯Ψ, the eﬀective potential
must possess a local minimum there, and the non-conservative term must either provide damping or
else remain suﬃciently small if excitatory. In fact, the non-conservative term is expected to be small
compared to the second term in the conservative force. Their ratio is given by

Again, for realistic parameters, the force balance typically resides predominately between the ﬁrst two
terms in (70), and hence this upper bound, although approximate, is expected to provide a reasonably
tight cutoﬀ for autoresonant phase-locking, which has been conﬁrmed by numerical simulation. This
inequality can also be thought of as giving the maximum achievable plasma wave amplitude (implicitly
as a function of
I0) for a given chirp rate and laser power. We show the dependence of the saturated
longitudinal ﬁeld on the chirp rate as a solid line in Fig. 2(a) for a number of diﬀerent drive strengths.
For a ﬁxed drive strength ǫ, the maximum attainable electric ﬁeld jumps discontinuously at the critical
chirp rate αc given by (64). The dotted lines correspond to solutions of (71) that cannot be accessed
when starting from vanishing initial longitudinal ﬁeld, and as such constitutes a form of hysteresis in
the excitation. The solid lines show the stable branches for the case of interest: excitation from a
quiescent plasma via slow downward chirping from a drive initially above resonance. Fig. 2(b) shows
a comparison of the theoretical maximum amplitude and that found by numerically integrating the
quasi-static equation of motion (43).

autoresonance is lost, the average phase should be near
traced back to the nonlinear nature of the forcing in (43), where the eﬀective strength of the forcing
depends both on the external drive intensity and the plasma wave amplitude; physically, to the fact that
as the plasma wave grows, the electrons become increasingly relativistic and therefore less susceptible to
displacement via the ponderomotive forcing at a ﬁxed intensity, so the eﬀective strength of a given drive
actually decreases. In principle, this may be counteracted by either slowly increasing the laser amplitude
or, more practically, by slowly decreasing the chirp rate in time. In the latter case, the rate of growth of
the plasma wave will fall oﬀ because it is directly tied to the decreasing drive frequency, but the wave
can remain frequency-locked with the drive indeﬁnitely (with some oscillating excursions.)

As a result of relativistic detuning, recall that in the original RL/TD scheme, the plasma wave amplitude

amplitude its phase slowly slips until it is more than
π/2 out of phase with respect to the laser beat and
∼
then gives its energy back to the lasers, then continues to shift further out of phase, only to be re-excited
when its amplitude approaches zero and it can re-establish phase matching with the drive. Both the
frequency diﬀerence between plasma wave and drive and the phase-lag exhibit continuous oscillations in
time.

In the DMG scheme, which relies on autoresonance but starts at linear resonance, the plasma wave
amplitude not only can peak at a higher maximum than in the original scheme, but typically will sustain
a higher average value at long times, exhibiting a nonlinear ringing about some non-zero saturated value
rather than a full beating. We suspect that this behavior results from two features of the chirping: when
the autoresonant adiabatic condition fails, the wave phase is closer to its neutral value, with respect to
energy exchange with the drive, and after autoresonance is lost, the frequency diﬀerence and phase lag
each grow secularly in time rather than exhibiting oscillations. Depending on initial parameters, the
initial growth up to the absolute maximum can either be essentially monotonic, or exhibit a “staircase”
behavior, with intermittent plateaus or dips at local maxima between periods of resumed growth, before
ﬁnally leveling oﬀ with some ringing. When starting from resonance, the originally published numerical
examples [27] and our own simulations suggest that the observed ripples in the amplitude excitation are
actually minimized at some intermediate value of the chirp rate, implying that the excitation may not
be fully autoresonant in some sense.

In our autoresonant scheme based on APTR, the behavior more closely resembles that in DMG scheme,
but exhibits more nearly monotonic growth, higher peak ﬁelds, and less ringing after saturation. Specif-
ically, some slow oscillations in the amplitude may be present early on, but once nonlinear phase-locking
has been achieved, the growth remains monotonic or virtually so until ﬁnally the amplitude levels oﬀ
and appears to almost saturate, with only a very small amount of subsequent ringing.

The extent of the amplitude and phase excursions, which aﬀect how regularly the excitation grows and
how closely the phase is locked during autoresonant excitation, and also how much ringing persists after
saturation, are determined by how deeply the phase is trapped in its eﬀective potential well. This in
turn depends both on how steep and how deep is the available well (determined by the plasma wave
amplitude and drive lasers parameters), and to what extent the phase can be nudged into position near
the bottom of the well and kept there (determined by the initial conditions and the adiabaticity of the
chirped forcing).

Numerical simulations suggest that, as one would expect, the extent or depth of this trapping is improved
by using a stronger drive (at least up to some moderately strong value), starting the drive frequency
further above resonance, and chirping more slowly.
In practice, of course, each of these strategies
involves trade-oﬀs. Increasing the drive strength increases the growth rates for laser-plasma instabilities
that might disrupt the forcing. Either increasing the initial frequency up-shift or decreasing the chirp
rate decreases the ﬁnal amplitude that can be reached during a ﬁxed interaction time.

V. EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

Unfortunately, as has been alluded to previously, the PBWA does not have unlimited time to be excited,
as deleterous instabilities will eventually destroy wave coherence. For the parameters of interest, the
oscillating two-stream (also referred to as modulational) instability limits the lifetime of coherent Lang-
muir waves to the ion time-scale, i.e., for times of the order of a few 1/ωi. Although it is possible that
the growth of this instability may be mitigated somewhat by the use of a chirped laser, in this paper we
will use as a conservative ﬁgure the results of Mora et. al. [13] to set the time limit during which we
can excite a coherent plasma wave suitable for accelerator applications.

For the relatively cold plasmas and moderately intense lasers we consider, it is shown in [13] that the
growth rate of the oscillating two-stream instability is approximately equal to ωi, and that this instability
impedes plasma wave excitation and destroys coherence after about 5 e-foldings. Thus, we see that the
drive lasers should have time duration T . 5/ωi. If one chirps the drive frequency leading to a total shift
δω during the autoresonant excitation, then the normalized chirp rate is limited to

Ampliﬁcation (CPA) [43, 44] Ti:Sapphire laser system. We demonstrate how, beginning with the laser
frequency above the linear resonance and then slowly decreasing it, one can robustly excite plasma waves
to amplitudes larger than the cold, linear wave-breaking limit in times commensurate with onset of the
oscillating two-stream instability.

A. CO2 Laser at 10 µm

We consider parameters roughly corresponding to the most recently published UCLA upgrade [18].
We assume two pulses of duration T = 100 ps which enter the plasma at t = 0, central wavelengths
near λ = 10 µm, and normalized intensities a1 = a2 = 0.14, corresponding to a normalized drive
strength ǫ = 0.02, so the threshold condition (64) implies that the normalized chirp rate should satisfy
d
α(t) =
dt ∆ω(t)/ωp < 0.0009. We choose a linear chirp, so that in physical units the beat frequency
is given by ∆ω(t) = (µ0 + α ωpt), where µ0 = 1.15 and α = 0.00065, with a total frequency sweep from
∆ω(t = 0) = 1.15 to ∆ω(t = T ) = 0.74. For these parameters, we collect the results from simulations
integrating the quasi-static equation of motion (43) in Fig. 3. 3(a) demonstrates the excitation of
a uniform accelerating ﬁeld Ez of 10 GV/m, which is above the linear cold wave-breaking limit of
61 GV/m. The total chirp is modest, only

about 1.5% of the laser carrier frequency 2πc/λ.

(ǫ = 0.09). APTR parameters are ∆ω(0) = 1.2, and ∆ω = 1 at t ≈ 1.4 ps (α = 0.00225). Total chirp is 3% of
the laser frequency. In (a), we see that the DMG and APTR scheme give approximately the same ﬁnal ﬁelds,
about three times that for on-resonance. In (b), we changed ωp by 10%, and the excitation for the DMG and the
on-resonant scheme drop considerably, while APTR maintains its large excitation. (c) demonstrates that APTR
gives robust, uniform accelerating ﬁelds for wide variations in density, while (d) indicates the insensitivity of
APTR to errors of ±35% in the plasma density, while still yielding large amplitude plasma waves.

Perhaps more important than the higher amplitude ﬁeld in the autoresonant APTR case, is the fact
that excitation is very robust with respect to mismatches between the beat frequency and the plasma
frequency. In practice, these mismatches inevitably result from limited diagnostic accuracy or shot-to-
shot jitter in the plasma or laser parameters. Because one sweeps over a reasonably broad frequency
range and one only needs to pass through the resonance at some indeterminate point during the chirp
history, no precise matching is required, and the exact value of the plasma density need not be accurately
known. This robustness is demonstrated in Fig. 3(b)-(d). Plots (b) and (c) show the longitudinal ﬁeld

10%, from its “design” value,
while keeping the laser parameters ﬁxed. We see large levels of excitation for a wide range in plasma
variation, corresponding roughly to density mismatch/errors up to 20%. Thus, not only is autoresonant
plasma wave excitation eﬀective in avoiding saturation from detuning, it also mitigates experimental
uncertainties in or shot-to-shot variations of plasma density.

VI. DISCUSSION: COMPARISONS, SCALINGS, AND EXTENSIONS

In comparison to other PBWA schemes, including the ﬁxed beat-frequency approach, either at (RL/TD)
or below (TSS) linear resonance, the chirped (DMG) scheme, involving downward chirping from reso-
nance, or the non-resonant PBWA, scheme, recently proposed by Filip et al. [45, 46], involving strongly
forced waves at frequency shifts well below resonance in a marginally underdense plasma, the autoreso-
nant/APTR PBWA enjoys a number of advantages, in terms of plasma wave amplitude, robustness, and
quality. In previous sections we have seen how, for given drive laser intensity, autoresonant excitation
yields longitudinal ﬁelds that can be considerably higher than the RL limit set by relativistic detuning of
the plasma wave. We have also seen how APTR, i.e., slowly sweeping the frequency downward through
resonance, provides a much greater degree of robustness to density mismatches, since neither the ﬁnal
amplitude nor frequency of the plasma wave is very sensitive to the precise location of the actual linear
resonance, or to the precise chirp history.

Direct comparison with the chirped DMG scheme is slightly more complicated, as revealed in Fig. 5,
because both schemes rely on autoresonance. In principle, given unlimited excitation time in the APTR
case, and for any ﬁxed drive laser intensity, the plasma wave can be autoresonantly excited to any
amplitude at or below the nonlinear wave-breaking limit by choosing a suﬃciently slow chirp rate. This
is not always true for the DMG case starting at resonance, where performance appears to peak at some
intermediate chirp rate, with rapid detuning for signiﬁcantly faster chirp rates, and excessive ringing
for signiﬁcantly slower chirp. Without time constraints, the autoresonant APTR approach can always
produce higher longitudinal ﬁelds for the same drive laser intensity or comparable longitudinal ﬁelds
with smaller intensity. But in practice, the time allowed for excitation is inevitably limited, typically by
ion instabilities as previously addressed, or even if these are somehow controlled, then by laser scattering
or modulational instabilities, or ultimately by Landau or collisional damping of the Langmuir wave or
hydrodynamic expansion of the plasma.

1

If the DMG and the APTR schemes are compared for realistic parameters using the same drive laser
intensity and chirp rate, then autoresonant APTR excitation consistently results in larger electric ﬁelds
. But if the DMG scheme is started precisely on resonance,
for excitation times on the order of few ω−
i
but using a slower chirp rate so as to achieve roughly the same ﬁnal drive frequency as the APTR
approach (which started above resonance), then the DMG approach can experience phase-locking over
a longer time and can achieve slightly higher ﬁelds in the ﬁnite excitation time. Essentially, by using
a suﬃciently strong drive, chirp rates that are just slow enough to be adiabatic, and an initial beat
frequency precisely at resonance, the DMG trajectory can become autoresonantly phase-locked, but
without having to waste time by chirping down from some point well above the resonance as is done in
the APTR case. The catch is that such phase-locking behavior starting from resonance is quite sensitive
to the initial conditions, and DMG will fail to achieve persistent phase-locking if the resonance is missed
by just a few percent, so robust phase-locking behavior is unlikely to be experimentally reproducible,
unless one begins with the beat frequency safely above resonance and adiabatically sweep through it,
rather than trying to start precisely on resonance.

In order to excite larger electric ﬁelds at a given plasma density, autoresonant/APTR PBWA requires
either more intense drive lasers or longer excitation times or both. Even if technologically feasible, moving
to larger a2 introduces its own problems (as discussed below), and in any event tends to undercut one
of the primary comparative advantage of the PBWA over either the standard short-pulse or the self-
modulated LWFA. Since excitation times in the PBWA tend to be limited by deleterious ion instabilities
time-scale,

simply by (singly) ionizing a gas comprised of a higher-mass atomic species. With heavier ions, one has
more time to excite larger ﬁelds with the same laser power, or comparable ﬁelds with less laser power
In addition to ionic instabilities, laser instabilities are also of
before ion motion disrupts coherence.

in a more realistic simulations. There is some hope even that Raman scattering might be turned to
our advantage:
it may also be possible to exploit autoresonant excitation in counter-propagating or
colliding-pulse schemes [47, 48, 49], where the enhanced growth of the plasma waves associated with
Raman scatter may allow shorter excitation times for ﬁelds approaching the wave-breaking limit.

Strictly speaking, our simpliﬁed dynamical model has demonstrated the robustness of autoresonant
excitation only with respect to global density mismatches, and to small changes in the global chirp
rate, drive intensity, or initial detuning. But we believe that some of this robustness should persist
in the presence of moderate spatio-temporal variations and non-uniformity within the plasma and of
complex spatio-temporal structure and dynamics in the lasers, features which are not captured by the
idealized model used here. Eﬀects such as ionization dynamics, thermal ﬂuctuations, hydrodynamic
expansion, electron and ion plasma instabilities, ponderomotive blow-out, and of course the nonlinear
plasma excitation itself all lead to highly nontrivial plasma density proﬁles that vary in time and space
and change the local conditions for resonance. Likewise, diﬀraction, tunneling ionization and the resulting
ionization-induced depletion, refraction, and blue-shifting, as well as nonlinear focusing eﬀects due to
inhomogeneities and nonlinear back-action of the plasma wave on the EM ﬁelds, as well as Raman,
self-modulation, and other instabilities, all can lead to appreciable distortion of the driving laser ﬁelds
during the excitation process. The importance of these details for autoresonant wake excitation need to
be further studied in the context of more detailed laser-plasma models.

Any such variation, inhomogeneity, or complex dynamical structure in the evolving laser ﬁelds or plasma
is likely to prove deleterious in the absence of autoresonance with adiabatic passage through resonance,
drastically reducing wake excitation and uniformity. Longitudinal ﬁelds in some spatial regions may be
resonantly excited to moderate or large amplitudes while other regions may be mismatched in density and
experience very little excitation, or may be ﬁrst excited and then subsequently de-excited as a result of
phase slippage and energy exchange back to the lasers. As a result,we expect the ﬁnal plasma wave to be

21

a highly irregular accelerating structure. But our autoresonant approach enjoys an intrinsic insensitivity
and persistence, due to the local nature of the phase-locking. Provided only that the magnitude and
scales for the non-uniformity are such as to allow an eikonal treatment of the waves, we expect [31]
that at each position, the local plasma response will be autoresonantly excited by the drive, based on
the local, slowly-varying values of the plasma frequency, drive amplitude, beat frequency, and chirp
rate. Once phase-locked, the local Langmuir wave will grow monotonically to large amplitude, then
saturate with very little ringing. Not all spatial regions will reach precisely the same ﬁnal amplitude,
but eventually the wave can grow monotonically more or less everywhere until local saturation ensues, so
the ﬁnal variations should be considerably less than in standard approaches. Although plausible, given
what has been demonstrated in previous analyses of autoresonant phenomena, this expectation should
also be veriﬁed in more realistic simulations.

We have also neglected all thermal eﬀects, but, in realistic situations, tunneling ionization by and inverse
bremstrahlung of the drive lasers will typically result in plasma temperatures of Te & O(10 eV). Damping
of the high phase-velocity plasma waves should remain small, but thermal eﬀects can lead to increased
particle-trapping and lower thresholds for wave-breaking as well as induce changes in the Langmuir
dispersion relation, while also resulting in some background of random short-scale density ﬂuctuations
and electrostatic oscillations which may impact the initial stages of autoresonant phase-locking, which
assumes a suitably quiescent plasma. This too may be further invesitgated via numerical simulation.

The suitability of the excited plasma waves for relativistic particle acceleration depends not only on the
magnitude and uniformity of the peak electric ﬁelds ﬁelds but even more crucially on the uniformity of the
phase and phase velocity, and on the degree of phase-locking to the external drive. The Langmuir phase
velocity vp approximately matches the laser group velocity vg, so ﬁrst one should consider variability in
the latter. Diﬀractive eﬀects can substantially lower the longitudinal group velocity of the laser [19], but

With variations in the group velocity vg expected to be small, phase coherence of the plasma wave will
depend on how closely vp follows the essentially constant vg = ¯vg of the laser. Particle-in Cell (PIC)
simulations of Filip et al. [46] suggest that for the RL scheme, the eﬀective phase velocity of the nonlinear
plasma wave (measured in terms of the progression of the ﬁeld maximum) can vary appreciably, i.e., 10%
to 20%, reﬂecting phase slippage of the Langmuir wave primarily as a result of ponderomotive blowout
and relativistic detuning, while the plasma wave produced in their non-resonant PBWA scheme exhibits
substantially less phase slippage. By working within the QSA, in 1D geometry without transverse
density variation, we cannot independently assess any such slippage eﬀects for the present scheme, but
we anticipate that it will be similarly small by virtue of the autoresoant phase-locking. That is, in the
resonant RL/TD scheme, plasma inhomogeneities can lead to accelerating buckets that have a changing
phase, so that electrons do not experience a constant accelerating ﬁeld. With autoresonance, however,
the laser can phase lock to a range of densities, creating an accelerating ﬁeld of uniform phase that is
everywhere directly related to the local phase of the driving beat wave.

An appealing feature of both the non-resonant PBWA and autoresonant PBWA is this ostensible ability
to phase-lock the plasma wave to the beat-wave of the applied drive lasers, with the implied hope that the
electron injection, whether based on external cathode injection [50] or internal optical injection [51, 52]
can also be phase-locked to the same lasers. Because of its potential importance, this phase-locking
deserves careful investigation. An obvious worry with the non-resonant PBWA is that entrainment is
achieved by brute force, in contrast to our self-trapping using adiabatic passage through resonance.
Because of the intrinsic ineﬃciency of non-resonant forcing, it must rely on large driving ﬁelds and
denser plasma to achieve large accelerating ﬁelds. But increasing ωp and a2 also increases group-velocity
dispersion, which can inhibit phase-locking to an externally-known reference phase, and increases the
growth rates for Raman and self-focusing instabilities which can modulate the laser envelope. One runs
the risk of turning the non-resonant PBWA into a self-modulated LWFA. That is, such modulation
can actually enhance the production of plasma waves, but the the plasma response can then become
entrained not to the initial laser envelope as applied to the plasma, with a prescribed shape and phase,
but to the envelope after it has undergone some uncontrolled nonlinear evolution and modulation.

FIG. 6: Evolving phase diﬀerence between the maxima of the laser beat and the longitudinal electric Ez (which
may diﬀer from Ψ in the text by a constant). Plot (a) has ǫ = 0.005, α = 0.0001, with the phase slowly evolving
during autoresonance for 0 < ξ < 2700, where Ez saturates. (b) uses the CO2 laser parameters of Fig. 3, which
demonstrates nearly constant phase locking during autoresonant excitation for 40 < ξ < 100, permitting good
control of electron injection.

One must also carefully distinguish phase-locking from frequency-locking, however much all forms of
oscillatory entrainment tend to be conﬂated under the former name. Perfect phase-locking implies
perfect frequency-locking, and conversely (at least up to some constant but perhaps unknown phase),
but in the case of only partial or imperfect entrainment, it is possible to achieve good frequency-locking
without adequate phase-locking, or the converse. Whether the relative error in the phase-matching or
in frequency-matching between driving and driven oscillation is greater depends on whether the Fourier
content of ﬂuctuations in the phase is primarily at higher or lower frequencies than the drive frequency
itself.

For the purpose of matched particle injection, it is phase-locking which is desired, yet some caution
is warranted in claims of true phase-locking in either the non-resonant or autoresonant PBWA. In any
frequency-locked PBWA scheme, the nonlinear frequency of the Langmuir wave may be closely entrained
to the precisely known drive frequency, but this does not necessarily imply that the absolute phase of the
Langmuir wave may be precisely known. As a mechanism for phase-locking in the non-resonant PBWA,
the authors appeal to the claim that an harmonic oscillator, strongly driven oﬀ resonance, remains
synchronous with the driving force, and then suggest that this should extend to nonlinear oscillators.
But this intuition holds only for damped linear oscillators after the transient is allowed to decay. If a
linear oscillator, with natural frequency ωn, and negligible damping on the observational time-scales,
is forced by a constant-amplitude, sinusoidal drive with frequency ωd < ωn, then, independent of the
strength of the drive, the driven oscillator will exhibit persistent, oscillating variations in phase relative
O(ωd/ωn), i.e., only ﬁrst-order in their frequency ratio.
to the drive phase ψd = ωdt + ψd(0) which are
There is no obvious reason to expect in general that nonlinearities will improve matters.

∼

In the autoresonant case, we may also encounter seemingly good frequency-locking either with compa-
rably good or disappointingly inferior phase-locking, as shown in Fig. 6, where we plot, for two of our
previous examples, the phase lag between the beat-wave of the lasers and the plasma wave, numerically
estimated by the oﬀset between corresponding relative maxima. Fig. 6(a) exhibits oscillating phase vari-
ation which is slowly varying compared to ωp, but of order . π/2 in absolute (not relative) magnitude,
even within the fully nonlinear regime of autoresonance prior to saturation. On any one shot, an injected
electron bunch, if suﬃciently relativistic (with electron trajectories ξe(τ )
ξe(0) ) and suﬃciently short
cβp/c), would experience uniform acceleration and little additional energy spread.
(bunch length ∆ze ≪
But the exact phase of the maximal accelerating ﬁeld could not be reliably predicted from one shot
to the next, so there would be considerable shot-to-shot variation in average energy gain of the bunch
and no way to reproducibly exploit the peak ﬁeld, even if the arrival time of the bunch was perfectly
correlated with the known beat-phase of the drive lasers in vacuum.

≈

In contrast, in the second case of Fig. 6(b), as the oscillator passes through resonance, the plasma wave
phase tightly locks with the drive phase and remains so until adiabaticity is lost and the excitation

maximum acceleration gradient. It appears that the extent of this phase error is determined by how
deeply the oscillator phase is trapped in its eﬀective potential, which improves with greater drive strength,
slower chirp rate, and initial detuning further above resonance.

23

The most obvious drawback to the autoresonant APTR scheme, in comparison to the standard RL/TD
approach, is the added complication of a chirped drive. But the total chirp required is modest, on the
order of only ωp in order to guarantee, in the face of some uncertainty as to the density, adiabatic passage
through resonance from above. In typical strongly underdense plasmas this corresponds to only a few
percent of the laser carrier frequency. In solid-state CPA laser systems, this should be relatively easy
to achieve, because the laser pulse already undergoes optical stretching/chirping and compression/de-
20% near
chirping in a series of gratings, and the gain bandwidth of the crystals is intrinsically large (
λ
1 µm). One need only adjust the CPA optics so as to only partially re-compress the ﬁnal chirped,
ampliﬁed pulse, in order to leave some residual chirping.

∼

∼

In CO2 lasers (or other gas laser systems), the gain bandwidths tend to be narrower, but can eﬀectively
be increased by operating at suﬃciently high pressures to doppler-broaden the rotational lines into an
overlapping quasi-continuum. If the ﬁnal intensities and ﬂuences needed are below the damage threshold
for the required optics, one can simply add a pair of gratings similar to those used in CPA systems in
order to chirp one of the ampliﬁed beams [53]. If the ﬁnal intensity is too large, then with somewhat
more diﬃculty one might arrange a multi-stage system, where an initial seed pulse is chirped in this
manner before passing through the ﬁnal ampliﬁer stage, involving a gas under suﬃcient pressure to cover
the bandwidth of the chirped seed. More exotically, one might imagine using nonlinear optical eﬀects in
a gas or plasma cell to achieve the required frequency shifts.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have introduced a straightforward, seemingly minor, modiﬁcation of the DMG scheme for the chirped-
pulse PBWA, based on the nonlinear phenomenon of autoresonance with adiabatic passage through res-
onance (APTR), which nevertheless enjoys certain advantages over previous approaches. Rather than
starting at the linear resonance and chirping downward at some intermediate rate expected to match,
on average, the beat frequency to the plasma wave frequency corresponding to the growing value of
the plasma wave amplitude, we start above resonance and sweep the beat frequency downward past
the resonance, at any suﬃciently slow chirp rate, such that the plasma wave frequency beat frequency
automatically self-locks to the drive frequency, and the plasma wave amplitude automatically adjusts
itself consistent with this frequency. This autoresonant excitation achieves higher plasma wave ampli-
tudes at moderate laser intensities, and, most importantly, appears to be much more robust to inevitable
uncertainties and variations in plasma and laser parameters. Preliminary analysis has been performed
within a simpliﬁed analytic and numerical model, and wake excitation has been studied using realis-
tic parameters for Ti:Sapphire and CO2 laser systems. The results are very encouraging, and warrant
extending investigation to higher-dimensional geometries, more realistic plasma inhomogeneities, and
self-consistent laser evolution, via numerical solution with ﬂuid and particle-in-cell (PIC) codes.

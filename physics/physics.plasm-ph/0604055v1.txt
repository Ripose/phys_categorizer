Abstract. – We present an investigation of the electromagnetic instabilities which are trig-
gered when an ultra relativistic electron beam passes through a plasma. The linear growth rate
is computed for every direction of propagation of the unstable modes, and temperatures are
modelled using simple waterbag distribution functions. The ultra relativistic unstable spec-
trum is located around a very narrow band centered on a critical angle which value is given
analytically. The growth rate of modes propagating in this direction decreases like k

−1/3.

The interaction of a relativistic electron beam with a plasma is a subject of relevance
from many ﬁelds of physics ranging from inertial conﬁnement fusion [1] to some astrophysical
scenarios [2–4]. The linear analysis of the interaction reveals an highly unstable situation
which has been investigated for a long time. Modes propagating along the beam are unstable
within a certain range of wave-vector and form the electrostatic two-stream instability. The
so-called ﬁlamentation instability is found for modes propagating transversely to the beam
and ﬁnally, it can be proved that some modes propagating at arbitrary angle to the beam
are also unstable [5]. As far as the growth rate is concerned, we see that it is eventually
a function of the parallel and perpendicular wave vector components. As long as the beam
is not relativistic, the largest growth rate are found for wave vectors parallel to the beam
which means that the two-stream instability dominates the linear evolution of the system in
this regime [6]. The situation evolves when considering a relativistic electron beam. Because
relativistic electrons are harder to move in the direction of their motion than in the transverse
direction, the two-stream growth rate is much more reduced than the growth rate of the modes
propagating transversely, or even obliquely. If we denote γb the beam relativistic factor, the
, the ﬁlamentation growth rate like γ−1/2
maximum two-stream growth rate is scaled like γ−1
b
whereas the growth rate of the most unstable oblique wave vector is scaled like γ−1/3
[5]. This
shows that oblique instabilities should dominate all the more than the beam is relativistic.
The ultra relativistic limit is relevant for astrophysical settings such as high energy cosmic
rays or gamma ray bursts production scenarios, for which some authors consider relativistic
factors up to 102 [2] and even 107 [3]. These unstable oblique modes were ﬁrst investigated in
the cold limit (ﬂuid approximation), and a temperature dependant treatment has only been
developed recently [7]. As we shall see in this letter, accounting for temperatures in the beam

We implement a 3D formalism using the linearized relativistic Vlasov equation as well as

If we start considering a cold mono energetic beam entering a cold plasma, the resulting
growth rate map is the one pictured on ﬁgure 1. We plot the growth rate normalized to the
maximum oblique one in terms of the reduced wave vector Z = kVb/ωpp. In this cold limit,
the maximum two-stream, ﬁlamentation, and oblique growth rates read

One can check that the two-stream instability is negligible compared to the oblique and the
normal modes. We also note on ﬁg. 1 that the most unstable modes form a continuum at

The introduction of temperatures modify the picture in various ways. As long as they
remain “small”, they can be modelled through some simple waterbag distributions and the
tensor elements (2) can be calculated exactly [7]. It turns out that the resulting dispersion
function has various singularities corresponding to various kind of preferential coupling be-
tween a mode and some electron population. As the wave vector is more and more oblique,
these singularities evolve and two of them overlap for a critical inclination angle θc with the
beam, which ultra relativistic expression is simply

tan θc =

1 + nb/np
Vtp/Vb

,

where Vtp is the plasma thermal velocity. At this junction, let us comment what is meant by
“small temperatures”. As far as the plasma temperature is concerned, it simply means that
the thermal velocity must remains small compared to the beam one. The present analysis
is therefore valid for non-relativistic plasma temperatures, allowing for a 10 keV plasma for
example. As far as beam temperature is concerned, transverse and parallel temperatures can
be treated diﬀerently. Let us assume a waterbag distribution function deﬁning a momentum
spread around Pb = γbmVb,

where Θ is the step function. As can be seen on eqs. (2), the tensor elements are mostly de-
pendent of the velocity distribution through the quantities p/γ, and this is perfectly expected
since the stability of a mode is a matter a wave particle interaction. Let us then evaluate
the velocity spread (∆vk, ∆v⊥) corresponding to the momentum spread (Ptbk, Ptb⊥) deﬁned
above. In the present ultra relativistic regime, we ﬁnd

We recover for ∆v⊥ the velocity spread corresponding to the momentum spread Ptb⊥. But

Fig. 2 – Numerical evaluation of the growth rate for a hot beam and a hot plasma, in terms of
Z = kVb/ωpp. The growth rate is normalized to its maximum value δO given by eqs. (3). Parameters

Considering a relativistic beam with γb = 200, nb = np/10 and neglecting its parallel
thermal spread, we plot on ﬁg. 2 the growth rate in terms of Z = kVb/ωpp. The continuum
of the most unstable modes observed on ﬁg. 1 has turned into a very thin oblique region
where the growth rate is higher than 90% of its cold oblique value δO given by eq. (3) up to
Z
50. Let us emphasize that unlike ﬁg. 1 where the largest reduced wave vector plotted
is Zz = 1.5 and Zx = 5, we here extend the plot up to Zz = 5 and Zx = 50. Modes located
γb/(Vtp/Vb) + Zz tan θc [7]. We also note
above the critical angle are unstable up to Zx ∼
that the transition towards stable modes bellow the critical angle is very sharp so that the
instability domain is almost rigourously bounded by the directions θc and π/2. The critical
84.8◦, which corresponds very precisely to what is
angle obtained from eq. (4) is arctan(11)
observed on the graph. In order to study the growth rate at large Z in the critical direction,
we plot on ﬁgure 3 the maximum growth rate at angle θc for Z up to 104. We observe a
decrease with Z which can presently be ﬁtted by δ/δO = 2.1Z −1/3. It is interesting to notice
that the maximum ﬁlamentation growth rate is here δF = 0.41δO so that the growth rate in
the critical direction remains larger than the ﬁlamentation one until Z

150.

In conclusion, we have evaluated the growth rate of the electromagnetic instabilities for an
ultra-relativistic beam passing through a non-relativistic plasma for any angle of propagation
of the unstable modes. The parallel temperature of the beam can be neglected, and the

unstable waves are found in a narrow domain comprised between π/2 and the critical angle θc
which does not depends on the beam energy (see eq. 4). Within this region, the most unstable
modes are concentrated on a very narrow band extending around the critical direction, with
a growth rate decreasing like Z −1/3

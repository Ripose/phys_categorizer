We determine the spectral photon yield from a hot dense plasma irradiated by VUV-FEL light in
a Thomson scattering experiment. The Thomson signal is compared to the emission background
mainly caused by bremsstrahlung photons. We determine experimental conditions that allow for a
signal-to-background ratio larger than unity. By derivation of the Thomson and the bremsstrahlung
spectrum from linear response theory we present a consistent quantum statistical approach to both
processes. This allows for a systematic treatment of medium and quantum eﬀects such as dynamical
screening and strong collisions. Results are presented for the threshold FEL-intensity as a function
of density and temperature. We show that the account for quantum eﬀects leads to larger thresholds
as compared to previous work.

INTRODUCTION

available.

Thomson scattering is a well established technique for
experimental investigation of plasma parameters. Exam-
ples can be found in Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Observables
like particle density, temperature, composition, and ion-
ization degree can be spatially and temporally resolved
by analysis of the scattering spectrum [7]. Until recently,
coherent sources have been available only for the visible
and near UV part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Due
to the critial density nc = ω2ǫ0me/e2
1020 cm−3 for
optical probes, the applicability of Thomson scattering
using coherent sources was limited to targets of relatively
low density.

≈

Glenzer et al. [8, 9] have shown and explored the possi-
bility of x-ray Thomson scattering in solid density tar-
gets using the Ti He-α line at 4.75 keV as probe light
[10]. A new alternative emerged with the setup of VUV-
free electron lasers (VUV-FEL), providing pulsed coher-
ent radiation in the far (vacuum-) ultraviolet. At the
moment, the VUV-FEL at DESY Hamburg operates at
32 nm wavelength [11], corresponding to 38 eV photons.
With this new coherent light source, dense matter up to
solid densities of 1023 cm−3 [12, 13] can be penetrated.
Under these conditions, the Thomson spectrum permits
the determination of temperature and density directly
from the position and height of collective resonances, i.e.
plasmons, showing up in the scattering signal [9]. First
experiments will be performed in the near future at the
VUV-FEL facility at DESY at λ = 32 nm FEL wave-
length, while in later stages of the project, wavelengths
from 13 nm (VUV-FEL) down to 0.1 nm (X-FEL) will be

Due to the large number of

free charge carriers
at the temperatures and densities considered, thermal
bremsstrahlung emission, resulting from inelastic free-
free scattering, contributes signiﬁcantly to the emission
background. Therefore, experimental conditions such as
scattering angles, spectral properties of the probe and
the detector have to be chosen as to obtain a maximum
signal-to-background ratio. Background is to be under-
stood as bremsstrahlung radiation, whereas signal corre-
sponds to the photons having undergone Thomson scat-
tering.

So far, classical formulas for the bremsstrahlung emis-
sion level going back to Kramers [14] have been used to
determine threshold intensities of the external source to
overcome the background due to bremsstrahlung [15, 16].
The Kramers result, given below in Eq. (19), is derived
from the assumption of Keplerian trajectories of the emit-
ting electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld of an ion. It is thus
a purely classical result, quantum properties such as the
ﬁnite photon momentum as well as the quantum mechan-
ical nature of the scattering process are not accounted
for. By comparing the Thomson signal strength at the
laser wavelength λ = 14.7 nm to the bremsstrahlung pho-
ton yield calculated from Kramers formula, Baldis et al.
ﬁnd threshold intensities of 1013 W/cm2 for typical val-
ues of electron density ne = 1022 cm−3 and temperature
kBT = 100 eV [16].

In this work we perform the calculation of threshold
conditions (intensities) using improved expressions for
the bremsstrahlung spectrum. As usual, corrections to
Kramers formula for bremsstrahlung are described by
the so-called Gaunt factor [17].
In the simplest ap-
proach it is obtained by taking into account collisions
between electrons and ﬁxed ions in Born approximation.
In dense plasmas however, many-particle eﬀects as dy-
namical screening and strong collisions become impor-

tant. We show in this paper how the Gaunt factor can
be derived from linear response theory [18] in a general
way. Within this framework, modiﬁcations of the emis-
sion spectrum beyond Born aproximation can be included
in a systematic manner [19] as will be discussed later.

We then apply our formulas to determine the threshold
intensities for a broad range of experimental parameters
(wavelength, spectral properties of detectors, and diﬀer-
ent materials), relevant for future experiments at DESY.
Furthermore we compare Thomson and bremsstrahlung
photon yield over a ﬁnite spectral range. Thereby, and
by taking improved expressions for the bremsstrahlung
cross section, we show, that even higher thresholds have
to be reached in order to obtain a Thomson signal above
the bremsstrahlung level at least near the plasmon res-
onances. These peaks are much lower than the central
peak being essentially an ion feature.

The present work is organized as follows: In the ﬁrst
section we remind the basic notion of Thomson scatter-
ing and bremsstrahlung and how they can be expressed
in terms of the dynamic structure factor and the dielec-
tric function, respectively. Since these two quantities are
related to each other via the ﬂuctuation-dissipation the-
orem [20], we are able to describe both processes on a
common and consistent basis.
then compare

to
bremsstrahlung to the Thomson signal whose strength
is proportional to the ﬂux of incoming photons, i.e. the
power density of the external source. Thereby, we ﬁnd
expressions for the threshold power density as a function
of particle density and temperature. In the last section
we discuss our results for various sets of experimental
parameters relevant for future experiments at the VUV-
FEL.

II. THOMSON SCATTERING AND
BREMSSTRAHLUNG

The central quantity of interest is the spectral power
density dP/dV dλ dΩ, i.e. the amount of energy radiated
per unit scattering volume dV , wavelength dλ, and solid
angle dΩ. The total spectral power density is the sum of
the corresponding quantity for every radiative process in
the plasma. In this work we focus on Thomson scattering
and bremsstrahlung, i.e.

We have introduced the response function ¯R(λ), where
the bar denotes the folding with the detector function.
Note that we assume an optically thin plasma, thus ra-
diation transport is neglected. Also, due to the short
pulselength of the VUV-FEL (20-120 fs), we neglect the
heating of the plasma due to the probe beadue to the
probe beam.

The bremsstrahlung spectrum does solely depend on
the plasma parameters density and temperature, so
that, with a suitable formula for the bremsstrahlung

We will now brieﬂy sketch how expressions for the Thom-
son scattering and the bremsstrahlung spectrum can be
obtained from a common starting point, i.e. the dielectric
function of the plasma.

A. Thomson scattering

As well known, the cross section for Thomson scatter-
ing in a medium can be given in terms of the dynamic
structure factor (DSF), S(k, ω):

Ref. [23]. Due to the mass ratio me/mi ≪

S(k, ω) can be approximated by See(k, ω), the electronic
DSF.

sured within a Thomson scattering experiment. How-
ever, this requires an accurate theory of the dynamic
structure factor. The dynamic structure factor See(k, ω)
is closely related to the dielectric function via the

B. Bremsstrahlung

Radiative free-free transitions of electrons, known as
bremsstrahlung, represent the main source of emission in
a hot, fully ionized plasma. However, the bremsstrahlung
process requires the presence of a scattering partner that
carries the recoil momentum. Kinematically, emission by
electrons which scatter on ions is favoured.

For a thermally equilibrated plasma, emission, char-
acterized by the spectral power density j(ω), and the
absorption coeﬃcient α(ω) as the relative attenuation
of the intensity of electromagnetic waves propagating in
the medium per unit length, are linked by Kirchhoﬀ’s
law [24] j(ω) = L(ω)α(ω), with the Planck distribu-
tion L(ω) = ~ω3/
4π3c2(exp(~ω/kBT )
. Similar to
Thomson scattering, there exists a relation between the
rate of bremsstrahlung and the dynamic structure factor,
which is established by the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theo-
rem (7). In the long wavelength limit (k
0), the ab-
sorption coeﬃcient can be obtained from the imaginary
part of the dielectric function according to

Relations (7) and (8) enable us to treat both Thom-

namely an appropriate theory for the dielectric function.

C. Consistent approximations

The aim of this work is to compare both radiation
processes, Thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung, cal-
culated in a consistent approximation. The comparison
has to be carried out between the contributions of either
process in leading order of density.

giving the Bethe-Heitler cross section, see Ref.
The transition amplitude involves a longitudinal ﬁeld
(Coulomb ﬁeld) i.e. a scattering partner, say an ion of
eﬀective charge Zeﬀ. Thus, bremsstrahlung is naturally
of second order in density. A free electron does not emit
bremsstrahlung, unless collisions take place. The chal-
lenge is then to accuratly describe the scattering process
itself.

Born approximation, as given by Eq. (10) is a rather in-
complete description, which does not give the correct be-
haviour of the bremsstrahlung spectrum at high transfer
momenta, so called strong scatterings. These can be in-
cluded by ladder-summation of all one-photon exchange
processes, which leads to the t-matrix. Therebye, the
electron-ion interaction is treated accuratly in all orders.
In the Coulomb limit, one ﬁnds Sommerfeld’s expression
for bremsstrahlung, see Eq. (22) below, and see Ref. [25].
On the other hand, due to the long range behaviour of
the Coulomb potential, Born approximation as well as
the Sommerfeld result suﬀer from infrared divergencies.
Here, the account for screening leads to convergent re-
sults. For details, we refer to Ref. [19]. In our calcula-
tion we will use Sommerfeld’s formula Eq. (22). Since we
are interested in the bremsstrahlung spectrum at high
frequencies, i.e.
in the vicinity of the FEL frequency
(~ω0 = 38 eV), no screening eﬀects are considered here.
Note that the use of the t-matrix does not increase the or-
der in density, instead, it gives the accurate Gaunt factor
in leading order of density. Further many-particle eﬀects
like self-energy and vertex corrections lead to higher or-
der contributions in density and, therefore, are not con-
sidered here. For a consistent treatment of the self-energy
of the scattering electron, given by multiple scattering on
ions and its impact on the bremsstrahlung spectrum, see
Ref. [26].

In the case of Thomson scattering, we adopt the same
strategy: We calculate the contribution from lowest order
in density. Unlike bremsstrahlung, already the ﬁrst order
in density gives a ﬁnite contribution. The amplitude for
Thomson scattering in second order of the interaction

Thus, the DSF, which describes the Thomson scatter-
ing in the medium, is taken in random phase approxi-
mation (RPA) that takes into account for the dynamical
screening. This is all the more important, as the Thom-
son scattering cross section is evaluated in the vicinity of
the plasma frequency where dynamical screening is the
dominant eﬀect [20]. Collisions are neglected, since they
occur in the next to leading order in density.

To conclude, a consistent comparison between Thom-
son scattering and bremsstrahlung in media asks for the
cross section of either process in leading order in density.
This consideration leads us to the RPA for the dynamic
structure factor, and a t-matrix ladder summation for
the bremsstrahlung spectrum.

In the following, we will give an outline of linear re-
sponse theory, which will be used to calculate the dielec-
tric response function. This key quantity then gives us
the power spectra of both processes under consideration
here. However, due to the arguments given above, the
leading order contributions of both processes under con-
sideration are given by diﬀerent orders in density.

III. LINEAR RESPONSE THEORY

Thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung can be deter-

mined by the longitudinal dielectric function ǫl(k, ω).

We will now brieﬂy outline how the longitudinal dielec-
tric function can be obtained in the framework of linear
response theory. A discussion of its fundamental aspects
can be found in [18], for various applications to optical
properties of plasmas, see [20]. In general, the longitu-
dinal dielectric function ǫl(k, ω) is given in terms of the
dielectric susceptibility χcc′(k, ω), where c and c′ label
the diﬀerent species in the plasma and further quantum
numbers such as spin,

IV. CALCULATION OF THE
BREMSSTRAHLUNG SPECTRUM

Since the bremsstrahlung spectrum is evaluated at fre-
quencies far above the plasma frequency, we can use the
high frequency limit of Eq. (12) in order to derive the
absorption coeﬃcient. For details, we refer to App. A.
In the high frequency limit, the absorption coeﬃcient (8)

good approximation for photon energies comparable to
the temperature ~ω/kBT
1 and for temperatures in
Z 2Ry for
the vicinity of the ionization energy (kBT
hydrogenic systems).
If one of these conditions is not
met, one should use the full Sommerfeld expression (22)
or appropriate approximations, see the detailed discus-
sion in Ref. [33]. For the VUV-FEL experiments, both
requirements are satisﬁed only roughly: The laser pro-

pump laser will excite the plasma to temperatures of
10 . . . 50 eV, which is of almost the same order

Thus we take into account the Gaunt factor in t-matrix

of the Gaunt factor is dominated by the t-matrix con-
tribution, whereas dynamical screening can be neglected
since the considered frequencies are large compared to
the plasma frequency.

Eq. (32) contains two terms: The ﬁrst term is basi-
cally the DSF of a free electron gas. However, it also
contains the ionic dispersion function, which accounts
for the screening eﬀect of ions. The second term gives
the scattering signal from electrons which are close to
ions and are therefore determined by the dynamics of
these heavy particles. This term is dominant at small ω
where W (xe) can be approximated by its static limit, i.e.
1. For larger values of ω, the ﬁrst term
W (xe ≪
dominates the spectrum, because the ion part is damped
out more rapidly than the electron part. In particular,
plasmon resonances, which appear in the spectrum due
to a vanishing real part of the denominator, only sur-
vive in the ﬁrst term, while they are damped out in the
second. As discussed in App. C, in so-called Salpeter
approximation [38] the DSF (32) is separated into two
terms depending only on electronic and on ionic vari-
ables respectively. One then obtains the same expression
as given by Chihara [22] in the limit of complete ion-
ization. This means, Chihara’s expression for the DSF
neglects part of the electron-ion correlation and the exact
RPA result should be used.

Having the thermal emission spectrum (20) and the dy-
namic structure factor (32) at our disposal, we are now in
the position to compare the signal from Thomson scatter-
ing to the bremsstrahlung background thereby treating
both processes on a common basis.

VI. RESULTS

We now compare power spectra for Thomson scatter-
ing and bremsstrahlung emission. Figures 3 - 6 show
results for diﬀerent combinations of electron density and
temperature for a hydrogenic plasma. We consider den-
sities ne = 1020 cm−3 and 1022 cm−3 and temperatures
of 10 eV and 50 eV as examples for possible experi-
mental conditions with cryogenic targets. Furthermore,
backscattering geometry (scattering angle 120◦) is chosen
and a VUV laser wavelength of λ = 32 nm is assumed.

To model the detector, we assume a detector function
G(λ) of gaussian shape, its width given by the relative

spectral bandwidth ∆λ/λ = ∆ω/ω [16]

G(λ) =

√2πσ2

/2σ

e−λ

,

σ = 0.425∆λ .

(34)

For the case of bremsstrahlung we neglect the eﬀect of the
ﬁnite bandwidth of the detector, since the corresponding
spectrum is only slowly varying with frequency. The ef-
fective ion charge Zeﬀ is calculated from Thomas-Fermi
theory [28] for every combination of electron density and
temperature considered.

In Fig. 3, the black dashed curve represents the pure
Thomson signal, i.e. no convolution with the detector
function G(λ), cf. Eq. (34), has been performed. For the
present parameters ne = 1020 cm−3, and kBTe = 10 eV,
the Thomson spectrum contains a very narrow ion peak,
situated at the laser wavelength, and two satellites, which
can be identiﬁed as electronic plasmon resonances. The
central peak dominates these electronic resonances by a
factor of 10, approximately. The solid black curve is ob-
tained by convolution of the pure Thomson signal (dot-
ted black curve) with the detector function. The detec-
tor resolution is set to ∆λ = 3.2 nm, which corresponds
to 1% of the central wavelength. Due to the broad de-
tector function, the central peak is lowered and broad-
ened such that the plasmon resonances do not show up as
seperate structures anymore. Instead, they only provide
sidewings in the spectrum. In Fig. 4 (ne = 1022 cm−3,
and kBTe = 10 eV), the electronic peaks are totally ab-
sorbed in the central peak. In this case, the ion peak in
the unconvoluted signal (not shown) is several orders of
magnitude larger than the electronic resonances, which
therefore do not contribute to the convolution integral
(3). For Fig. 5 (ne = 1020 cm−3, and kBTe = 50 eV), the
same arguments as for Fig. 3 apply: The electronic fea-
ture almost vanishes in the broadened central ion peak.
Due to the higher temperature, the central peak is even
broader as for kBTe = 10 eV (Fig. 3). Finally, in Fig. 6
(ne = 1022 cm−3, and kBTe = 50 eV), we have the same
structure as in Fig. 4, no plasmon peaks are visible due
to the dominance of the ion feature.

In Figures 3-6, the intensity of the laser is chosen
such that the central peak is situated clearly above
the bremsstrahlung level. Three approximations for
bremsstrahlung are shown, namely Kramers formula
(19), Born approximation (18) and Sommerfeld’s formula
(22). Born approximation gives larger deviations from
Kramers result than the Sommerfeld expression. This
corresponds to the behaviour of the Gaunt factor shown
in Fig. 2: The Sommerfeld result is always closer to unity
than Born approximation.

In the following, we evaluate the threshold intensity
Ithresh(ω) deﬁned in Eq. (4) using Eqs. (3), (5), and (32)
for the Thomson power spectrum and Eq. (20) with the
Gaunt factor in either Born approximation (21) or t-
matrix approximation (22) for the bremsstrahlung power
spectrum.

Figures 7-10 show contour plots of the threshold inten-
Te-plane. In Fig. 7 we compare

Kramers result (dashed curves) to Born approximation
(dotted curves) assuming aluminum as target material,
scattering angle θ = 20◦, ∆λ/λ = 10−4. These param-
eters have been chosen by Baldis et al.
in Ref. [16].
Their results are reproduced by using Kramers formula
for bremsstrahlung (dashed line). For low temperatures,
where the Gaunt factor in Born approximation is smaller
than unity at the considered photon energy, c.f. Fig. 2,
larger densities are accessible as compared to Kramers re-
sult. For high temperatures, the opposite becomes true,
¯gB(ω) > 1 leads to lower accessible densities.
In ﬁgures 8-10, three approximations have been calcu-
lated for the bremsstrahlung level. Besides Kramers for-
mula (dashed curves) we show results for Born approx-
imation (dotted lines) and Sommerfeld’s formula (solid

lines). Comparing the Sommerfeld result to Born ap-
proximation, it can be noted that Born approximation
overestimates quantum eﬀects, while Sommerfeld’s the-
ory leads to smaller deviations from Kramers result. This
is one important result of this work: Taking into account
quantum eﬀects in a rigorous way via Sommerfeld’s ex-
pression for the Gaunt factor leads only to small correc-
tions of threshold intensities, while Born approximation
tends to give larger corrections. Thus, it is important to
go beyond Born approximation, otherwise wrong results
are obtained. For moderate and high temperatures, the
Sommerfeld result lies systematically below the Kramers
result, due to the increasing Gaunt factor at high tem-
peratures.

Furthermore, we investigated the inﬂuence of other ex-

perimental parameters, namely the laser wavelength, the
material, and the spectral bandwidth of the spectrome-
ter. The latter parameter turns out to be of great impor-
tance: By comparison of Fig. 8 with Fig. 9, one observes
that notably higher densities are accessible in the case
of small spectral bandwidth (∆λ/λ = 10−4 in Fig. 9)
than for the relatively large bandwidth (∆λ/λ = 10−2 in
Fig. 8).

Comparing Fig. 7 to Fig. 9, the inﬂuence of the
Z-number of the material becomes apparent: Low
Z-materials produce less bremsstrahlung than high
the
Z-elements due
bremsstrahlung cross section, c.f. Eq. (19). On the other
hand, the Z-dependance of the dynamical structure fac-
tor largely cancels out for the free electron part of the
structure factor while it is roughly Z/(1 + Z)2 for the
ionic part, c.f. Eq. (32).

to the Z 2-proportionality of

Finally, important diﬀerences are noted upon changing
the laser wavelength from 32.0 nm (Fig. 9) to 13.0 nm
(Fig. 10) especially at low temperatures. Both data
sets have been calculated using the same spectral res-
olution (∆λ/λ = 10−4) and material (H). Looking at
Fig. 10 (λ = 13 nm) at low temperatures the thresh-
old contours are nearly independent of density. For
higher temperatures, both wavelengths 32 nm and 13 nm
give nearly equal threshold intensities, which do not de-
pend on temperature. This can be understood from the
bremsstrahlung spectrum, which becomes independent of
frequency and temperature at low ~ω/kBT .

Since the information about temperature and density
is stored in the position and height of the plasmon res-
onances, we will now focus on experimental conditions
to be met in order to separate the plasmon peak from
bremsstrahlung background. Results for the threshold
intensity are given in Tab. I. The electron density is set
to ne = 1021 cm−3, for ne = 1020 cm−3 and 1022 cm−3
see Fig. 3 - Fig. 6. Two wavelengths are considered,

λ = 32 nm, the momentary VUV-FEL wavelength at
DESY, and λ = 13 nm, envisaged wavelength for near fu-
ture. Since the latter wavelength allows for very eﬃcient
x-ray optics to be applied, the spectral resolution has
been reduced to ∆λ/λ = 10−4, while 32 nm allow only
for ∆λ/λ = 10−2. Finally the scattering angle has been
chosen such that the plasmon peak is on the one hand
well pronounced but on the other hand shifted far enough
from the central peak as to be resolved by the spectrom-
eter. For detailed discussion of the Thomson scatter-
ing spectrum at various plasma parameters, we refer to
Refs. [12, 13]. The rightmost column of Tab. I gives the
Gaunt factor in Sommerfeld approximation (Eq. (22)).
Note that in the case of the 32 nm wavelength, the thresh-
old intensity is increased by 14
22% due to the Gaunt
factor.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this work we have studied the question of radiation
processes in warm dense matter concerning plasma diag-
nostic experiments to be performed in near future. Two
processes, namely bremsstrahlung and Thomson scatter-
ing are antipodal to each other: Thomson scattering is
supposed to serve as a probe for plasma parameters, but
also bremsstrahlung gives an important contribution to
the photon yield from highly ionized plasmas. Thus, ex-
perimental conditions have to be determined that allow
for a maximum signal-to-background ratio. Here, we fo-
cused on the laser intensity. To this purpose, expres-
sions for the Thomson signal, which is given by the dy-
namical structure factor of the plasma as well as for the
bremsstrahlung spectrum have been derived from a com-

10

mon starting point, namely linear response theory. This
approach allows for a systematic treatment of medium
and quantum eﬀects, such as dynamical screening and
strong collisions.

We applied our formulas to determine threshold inten-
sities for the external photon source (FEL) as function
of density and temperature as well as their dependence
on further parameters, namely the laser wavelength, the
detectors spectral resolution, and the material.
In the
discussion we focused on the bremsstrahlung spectrum.
It was shown that Born approximation overestimates the
eﬀect of collisions, i.e.
it leads to relatively high Gaunt
factors if compared to Sommerfeld’s expression. Som-
merfeld’s formula (22) gives the correct Gaunt factor in
20 eV
a weakly coupled plasma. At temperatures kBTe ≥
threshold intensities calculated with the Gaunt factor
in Sommerfeld approximation are larger than those ob-
tained by Baldis et al.
in Ref. [16], who used Kramers
expression, i.e. ¯gﬀ = 1.

The Thomson signal was analysed within RPA which
gives the contribution in lowest order of density. For
densities investigated here, collisions are also relevant for
the Thomson signal and lead to a pronounced change
of the electronic part in S(k, λ). This was investigated
in Ref. [39]. However, the account for collisions do no
alter the results for the threshold intensities performed
in this work the Thomson scattering signal was evaluated
at the laser wavelength, were the ionic feature of the DSF
dominates.

Finally, we draw the conclusion, that Thomson scatter-
ing can easily overcome the bremsstrahlung background,
if laser intensities of 108 W/ cm2
1013 W/ cm2 are pro-
vided. From this point of view, Thomson scattering ex-
periments for plasma diagnostics using VUV-FEL radia-
tion seem possible.

In the high frequency limit ω

fraction is unity, the imaginary part of the collision
frequency tends to zero and the collision frequency is
small compared to the frequency ω. Then, we can
consider the approximation α(ω) = ω2
plRe ν(ω)/ω2c =
ω+iη/cǫ0ω2, where the collision frequency

is given in the form of a force-force correlation function,

proportional to the real part of the force-force correlation

This expression can also be derived from kinetic theory,
i.e. the perturbative expansion of Vlasov’s equation for

a two component plasma [15].
It was used in [16] to
compare the Thomson signal to the emission background
caused by thermal bremsstrahlung photons. Generaliza-
tion for distinct electron and ion temperatures Te and Ti
is straightforward, one obtains Eq. (32).

APPENDIX C: SALPETER’S AND CHIHARA’S
APPROXIMATION

By applying the so-called Salpeter-approximation [38]
to Eq. (B5) one obtains the DSF as a sum of terms which
depend only on electronic and ionic variables, respec-
tively

Omitting the term α2/(1 + α2) in the denominator of the
ionic part of Eq. (C1), both expressions (C1) and (C4)
for the DSF coincide.

−

Thus, we have shown how the Chihara separation (C2)
emerges in a natural way from a consistent two com-
ponent approach to the DSF as outlined in App. B.
However, our approach is more strict, since it contains
electron-ion correlations in its stringent form (32) and
only separates into two independent parts in Salpeter
approximation.

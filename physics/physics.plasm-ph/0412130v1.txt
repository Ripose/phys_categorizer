Abstract

Zonal ﬂows are recognised to play a crucial role for magnetised plasma conﬁnement. The genesis of

these ﬂows out of turbulent ﬂuctuations is therefore of signiﬁcant interest. We investigate the relative

importance of zonal ﬂow generation mechanisms via the Reynolds stress, Maxwell stress, and geodesic

acoustic mode (GAM) transfer in drift-Alfv´en turbulence. By means of numerical computations we quantify

the energy transfer into zonal ﬂows owing to each of these effects. The importance of the three driving

ingredients in electrostatic and electromagnetic turbulence for conditions relevant to the edge of fusion

devices is revealed for a broad range of parameters. The Reynolds stress is found to provide a ﬂow drive,

while the electromagnetic Maxwell stress is in the cases considered a sink for the ﬂow energy. In the limit

of high plasma beta, where electromagnetic effects and Alfv´en dynamics are important, the Maxwell stress

is found to cancel the Reynolds stress to a high degree. The geodesic oscillations, related to equilibrium

pressure proﬁle modiﬁcations due to poloidally asymmetric transport, can act as both sinks as drive terms,

depending on the parameter regime. For high beta cases the GAMs are the main drive of the ﬂow. This is

also reﬂected in the frequency dependence of the ﬂow, showing a distinct peak at the GAM frequency in

that regime.

INTRODUCTION

Since the discovery of the H-mode [1] in magnetically conﬁned plasmas a multitude of mech-

anisms for the generation of the shear ﬂow connected to the LH-transition have been proposed.

They include amongst others ion-orbit loss effects, neoclassical effects, and turbulent ﬂow gener-

ation [2, 3, 4]. Here we focus on turbulence as a source of shear ﬂow generation. It was already

early recognized that turbulence can lead to spontaneous self-organization of turbulent energy into

sheared poloidal ﬂows which in turn could reduce the transport signiﬁcantly [5]. A conclusive

computational demonstration of shear ﬂow generation by turbulence in realistic geometry of fu-

sion devices, which is sufﬁcient for achievement of the LH-transition, has, however, not yet been

achieved. In electrostatic turbulence the Reynolds stress is the main source of interaction between

large scale ﬂows and small scale turbulence. The Reynolds stress designates the radial ﬂux of

poloidal momentum, and a ﬁnite radial gradient of it will be an indication for a local condensation

of momentum into a poloidal ﬂow. In electromagnetic turbulence an additional source of poloidal

ﬂow generation has to be accounted for: the Maxwell stress, which arises from parallel momen-

tum transport along perturbed magnetic ﬁeld lines. Measurements of the Reynolds stress and its

radial variation have been performed in several fusion devices with the purpose to identify it as a

source of sheared poloidal rotation [6]. Recently, also the Maxwell stress, respectively, magnetic

ﬂuctuations and their cross-correlations have been measured in Reversed Field Pinch (RFP) [7]

and Tokamak [8] conﬁgurations. These measurements indicate that the Maxwell stress acts as a

sink for poloidal ﬂow energy. Finally, in the presence of toroidal magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneity

the geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs) [9] interact with the poloidal ﬂows in the system. In such

cases the zonal ﬂows show a residual oscillation at the GAM frequency.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate these three different transfer mechanisms for zonal ﬂow

generation over a wide range of parameters as neither their strength nor their detailed (driving or

damping) effect on the ﬂows are a priori sufﬁciently clear. While the Reynolds stress is most often

identiﬁed as a ﬂow drive, there is considerable confusion about the role of the GAMs [10, 11].
The Maxwell stress is in low b
the ﬂow [12] and in high b

situations rather weak, but it has been found to drain energy from

situations it should ideally cancel the Reynolds stress [13].

This paper is organized as follows: In the following Section II we present the turbulence model

used for the computations. The next Section III is devoted to discussion of the various transfer

mechanisms of energy between turbulence and ﬂow motion in a low and a high beta case. We then

2

present global scalings of the transfer terms with collisionality and plasma beta in Sec. IV. Finally

we discuss our results in the concluding section.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC TURBULENCE MODEL

We investigate the detailed balance of drive and sink terms for global poloidal ﬂows in a model

for plasma turbulence in the edge region of magnetic conﬁnement devices. Considering both elec-

trostatic and electromagnetic effects, together with toroidal geometry and magnetic ﬁeld curvature

in a ﬂux tube model, allows us to investigate the different turbulent momentum transfer terms re-

sponsible for ﬂow generation.

The ﬂuid equations for drift-Alfv´en turbulence in 3-dimensional ﬂux tube geometry result from

standard ordering based upon the slowness of the dynamics compared to the ion gyro frequency
i = eB/Mi and the smallness of the drift scale r s compared to the background pressure gradient

In the present paper we use a constant background temperature for electrons, and assume cold

ions. The quantity n00 is a normalizing density, while n0(x) is the equilibrium plasma density
having a ﬁnite gradient. In normalized units the radial proﬁle of the density is ¶ x log n0(x) =
1.
Thus x serves as the radial coordinate. Relative to the background magnetic ﬁeld ~B the other

perpendicular coordinate is y. Finally the parallel coordinate is denoted by z.

As singly charged ions and quasi-neutral dynamics are assumed, n0 and n refer to both the electron

and ion density. It is important to note that n0 and n equivalently describe electron density or

pressure; we neglect temperature dynamics in this qualitative study because of the similarity in

characterized by the originally deﬁned gradient.

may be due to a seed ﬂow or a background gradient, as is the case here. The second contribu-

with density sidebands via the compressibility of the diamagnetic drift, associated with geodesic

acoustic modes. Finally, viscosity on the right hand side of Eq. 12 introduces a damping of the

ﬂow proﬁle.

We are interested in the energetics of the ﬂow evolution. To ﬁnd the evolution of the energy in the

mean ﬂow we multiply the vorticity equation Eq. (2) by the ﬂow velocity and integrate over the

Flow generation by Reynolds stresses is well known to result from an average phase correlation

between the velocity ﬂuctuations in the drift plane spanned by the x and y coordinate axes. The

tendency of convective structures to be tilted with a seed sheared ﬂow makes the transfer term R

generally positive, draining energy from the ﬂuctuating motions to the zonal ﬂows [17].

It is worthwhile to note that in pure MHD turbulence there is an approximate balance between

Maxwell and Reynolds stress [13]. From a local linear analysis of modes, neglecting the toroidicity

of the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld, we obtain the following functional relationship between the

may cause an acceleration of zonal ﬂows in the presence of poloidally asymmetric particle ﬂuxes,

known as Stringer-Winsor spin-up [10, 19, 20, 21]. In this connection we also note that the energy

This indeed indicates the tendency towards a ballooning structure of the ﬂuctuations, since this

term drives velocity ﬂuctuations when the turbulent plasma transport is radially outwards from

the torus axis and poloidally towards the out-board mid-plane. This geodesic transfer process was

recently revisited in Ref. [11], where it was claimed that the GAM transfer is generally from the

zonal ﬂows through the density side-bands to the turbulent ﬂuctuations.

To address the simultaneous action of the energetic transfer effects we resort to three-

dimensional numerical computations of the four-ﬁeld model eqs. (2)- (5) on a grid of usually

in x, y and z, respectively. Some runs were

×
32 to ensure convergence. The numerical scheme uses

×

×

×

a symmetry, energy and vorticity conserving discretisation of the bracket structure of the nonlin-

earities [22] with the curvature terms cast into bracket form as well. Time stepping is performed

using an explicit third order stifﬂy-stable scheme [23], with viscous terms treated implicitly using

operator splitting. For more details on the numerical implementation see [24].

Nominal parameter values typical for tokamak edge plasmas are

e = 18750,

µ = 5, ˆs = 1,

w B = 0.05 and µW = µn = 0.025.

For parameter scans we varied

b
in a range between 0.1 – 30 and

b

from 0.5 – 7.5. The

scaling with

is especially interesting, as the drift-Alfv´en system has the property that the nature

b

b

of the turbulence changes with the degree to which the system is electromagnetic. This feature

b

was demonstrated numerically by Scott [18] and Naulin [24] and also experimentally by Lechte

et al [25]: The transition manifests itself in a change of the phase relationship between density

and potential ﬂuctuations, which varies for low values of ky from a small phase angle in pure drift
wave dynamics to p /2 in the MHD drift-ballooning regime. This is exempliﬁed in Figure 1, which

shows the phase probability distribution function as function of poloidal wavenumber for the cases
ˆb = 0.1,
n = 0.5. While in the low ˆb case, the phase angle is always small,
for the large ˆb cases we observe a much broader phase relationship and a generally larger phase

n = 2.295 and ˆb = 30,

b

angle. The regime of dominating MHD ballooning instability is ﬁrst reached at for the edge very
high values of ˆb > 30 [24].

A time-trace of the kinetic energy, K , of the ﬂuctuating motions and the zonal ﬂow energy
0 is presented in Fig. 2. It is seen that while K saturates after about 100 time
units, the saturation of the ﬂow takes place much later. Thus, all computations were run to times

dx(1/2)V 2

U =

R

t = 5000, with time averages taken in the interval from time t = 1000 to the end of the simulation,

to ensure a statistical steady state of ﬂuctuating quantities. Moreover, from Figure 2 it is observed

that the energy in the zonal ﬂows is only a fraction of the total kinetic energy. This underlines

the fact that no strong self-organized H-mode like transport barriers are formed in this system.

However, zonal ﬂows do form and inﬂuence the proﬁle of transport as well as the density proﬁle.

Due to the change in turbulence character connected to ˆb we will now proceed and present in more
detail two runs, the low beta ˆb = 0.1,

n = 2.295 and a high beta ˆb = 30,

n = 0.5 case.

Figure 3 shows a gray-scale plot of the zonal ﬂow proﬁle V0(x,t) and the zonal density

in time, where in both cases we omit the damping layers in the plot. It is clearly seen that the zonal

ﬂows are radially localized and while exhibiting some ﬂuctuation features, the ﬂow proﬁle is rather

persistent in time. The zonal density shows some imprint of the zonal ﬂow in terms of slightly

elevated density levels in the vicinity of high ﬂow shear, but ﬂuctuations in the zonal density are

more pronounced. It is worthwhile to remark that at about t

3750 a weakening of zonal ﬂows is

≈

clearly noticeable and prompts a transient radially propagating feature in the zonal density. This

provides us a visualisation of the interplay between ﬂows, transport and the density proﬁle.

In Fig. 4 we present time traces of the energy transfer terms into the zonal ﬂow and the rate of

change of the zonal ﬂow, together with the numerical error obtained by comparing the sum of the

energy transfer terms with the computed actual change rate of the ﬂow:

d F(t) =

dV0
dt Num. −

(R + M + G + V ) .

(22)

Here dV0/dtNum. is evaluated to second order in time [26]. The error d F(t) is of the same order,
and for ˆb = 0.1 the Maxwell stress energy transfer term M , which is negligible for this low
value of ˆb

, when compared to each other energy transfer term, is of the same size. The statistical

nature of the ﬂuctuating ﬂow drive terms is observed, as the balance between the transfer terms

is only reached on a long time average, whereas on an instantaneous view the transfer terms can

deviate signiﬁcantly from their means. Here viscous damping V and GAMs G serve as sinks

for the ﬂow energy, which is solely driven by the Reynolds stress. While both damping terms

vary on a rather slow time scale, the Reynolds stress and with it the resulting rate of the ﬂow

change vary on the faster time scale of the turbulence. Figure 5 shows correspondingly time

traces of selected ﬂuctuating quantities obtained at a single point and of ﬂux surface averaged

quantities at the same radial position. While the ﬂuctuating quantities are all varying on the fast

scale, the ﬂux surface averaged ones vary signiﬁcantly slower. Zonal density and zonal magnetic

potential show, however, variations on a time scale of about 250 and 80 time units, respectively.

The zonal ﬂow V0 shows some fast scale jitter, but varies only slowly over the shown 1500 time

units. Thus, to investigate that time behavior in more detail we present in Fig. 6 the frequency

spectra of ﬂux surface averaged quantities connected to GAMs, as the density and the parallel ion

velocity together with quantities related to zonal ﬂow dynamics. The zonal density

location one third into the radial x domain we experience a downshift by an additional factor of

approximately

1/2.

p

For the zonal ﬂow V0 and the zonal vorticity, we observe that the zero frequency mode domi-

nates the poloidal ﬂow spectrum. At the frequency of the zonal density feature we observe even

a small dip in the ﬂow frequency spectrum, this supporting the observation that GAMs are a sink

for the ﬂow energy in that parameter regime.

For the high ˆb = 30 case the situation looks differently as is clearly seen from Fig. 7. The zonal

ﬂow proﬁle is now broader and reveals much less persistence than in the low beta case (compare

Fig. 3). Correspondingly the zonal density shows also a less pronounced radial structure and the

characteristic time of the ﬂuctuations seems to be of similar size for both zonal ﬂow and zonal

density proﬁle.

The energy transfer rates R , M , and G , shown in Fig. 8 reﬂect this change in behavior. We

ﬁrst observe that the Maxwell stress is now of ﬁnite size and a signiﬁcant sink for the ﬂow energy.

It is very well correlated to the Reynolds stress in time, which still acts as a ﬂow drive. For an ideal

high beta MHD case in linear geometry without magnetic ﬁeld curvature the balance between M

and R is known to be exact with no preferred ﬂow direction in the dynamics, as seen in Eq. (19).

Here the resulting energy transfer from Maxwell and Reynolds stress is close to zero and the

resulting change in the effective zonal ﬂow drive is dominated by the GAMs G , which now acts as

a driving term. Consequently the resulting rate of change for the ﬂow evolves mainly along with

the change in the GAM drive and shows only a minor additional variation on the timescale of the

Reynolds and Maxwell stresses.

The time traces of ﬂuctuating and averaged quantities shown in Fig. 9, reﬂect that behavior. We

ﬁrst note that the ﬂuctuating quantities now show a somewhat more pronounced slower frequency,

which reﬂects the frequency observed in the time evolution of the zonal quantities. All ﬂuctuations
are larger by about a factor three compared to the low beta ˆb = 0.1 case. The zonal density is up

by a factor two to threee and a slow oscillation is clearly observed in both the zonal density as

the zonal magnetic potential. This slow frequency now is also found in the zonal ﬂow time trace.

These features get more obvious in the frequency spectra depicted in Fig. 10. A pronounced

low frequency behavior is now seen also in the ﬂow related quantities, namely in V0, which here

exceeds the zero frequency component by about a factor two. In these situations the ﬂow is not

stationary (zero frequency) but is, compared to the turbulence, a slowly varying structure. The
slow frequency of the ﬂow is close to the ideal GAMs frequency w GAM, revealing the ﬂow drive

by this process. These results are generally in agreement with experimental observations, that

show a modulation of the zonal ﬂows at the frequency of the GAM oscillation [27, 30].

V. PLASMA BETA AND COLLISIONALITY SCALINGS

Here we present results concerned with the scaling of the different transfer terms with colli-
sionality and plasma beta. In Fig. 11 we show the three main transfer terms as a function of ˆb
the Reynolds stress drive R gets slightly

n = 0.5. For increasing ˆb

for a low collisionality of

weaker, but is in all cases a drive. This indicates that the described ﬂows do not decay through a

b

Kelvin-Helmholtz like instability mechanism, which would make the Reynolds stress a sink term.

The Maxwell stress M starts close to zero and is always a sink term. It grows as expected in sig-
niﬁcance with increasing b

is the dominating sink for the ﬂow energy. The GAM

, and for large b

transfer, G , starts out as a sink for the ﬂow energy at low beta, but with increasing beta it looses
its importance as a sink. Finally, G becomes positive for the high beta ˆb = 30 case, e. g. the GAM

acts as a ﬂow drive.

We then look at the scaling of ﬂows and energy transfers with collisionality in the two cases

zonal ﬂow energy decreases with rising

of low and high beta. The results are presented in Fig. 12. We ﬁnd that the saturation level of
b and is in general by an order of magnitude

erned by vortex dynamics [28], where the zonal ﬂow contribution plays an important part for

self-regulation of the ﬂuctuation amplitudes, but is not dominating the energetics to an extent that

it would completely suppress the turbulence. Further, we observe that the ﬂuctuation energies K

and P =

dx(1/2) ˜n2 and the turbulent particle transport G n =

dxvxn both increase with paral-

lel resistivity

. This stronger turbulence level is due to the increasingly non-adiabatic nature of

R

the electron response due to collisions, which increases the nonlinear drive of drift modes. The

energy transfer terms behave as follows: The Reynolds stress decreases with increasing collision-

ality, accordingly with the decaying ﬂow energy. The Maxwell stress energy transfer M is always

negligible at low beta and thus the ﬂow energy is dissipated through the viscous terms V and the

R

b

geodesic channel.

Energies K , P and the transport G n approximately double when changing to

b = 30 and taking

the system from the drift into the ballooning regime. The magnetic ﬂutter effect is then an impor-

b

tant cause for the non-adiabatic response on the electrons. The inﬂuence of

is accordingly much

smaller and results in less variation for this high

b case.

b

We observe that the Reynolds stress is always a drive (R > 0) for the ﬂow. At high beta
b

the Maxwell stress is important and the balance between Maxwell and Reynolds stress becomes

obvious as

R is reached and exceeded. Finally the electromagnetic ﬂutter effect is taking

M

|

| ≈

out more energy from ﬂows than is injected by Reynolds stress spin-up. The ﬂow sustained in

this high beta regime is now maintained by geodesic transfer into the ﬂow. The driving effect
n and higher levels of transport:

by GAM oscillations on the ﬂow is more pronounced for higher

GAM transfer is closely linked to the energy of density ﬂuctuations in the m =

1 sideband

±

(and thus to energy in all other scales that couple by three-wave interaction to this sideband),

which directly scales the transfer term G . For higher resistivity the relative importance of G is

thus enhanced in the same amount as ˜n increases both due to a more resistive as well as more
electromagnetic electron response. The strong magnetic ﬂutter ˜B

in high beta turbulence can

b

⊥

cause signiﬁcant chaotic deviations of ﬁeld lines radially and poloidally from the ﬂux coordinates

that were deﬁned for an unperturbed magnetic ﬁeld. The parallel coupling is thus able to connect

regions of neighboring radial domains where the amount of radial overlap is rising with

. Zonal

structures may be efﬁciently destroyed for a strong ﬂutter effect, and the aligning character of

b

Reynolds stress on zonal ﬂows is counteracted, thus also the radial structure of the zonal ﬂows is

less pronounced in the high beta case, see Fig. 7. The drive of vortices on the drift wave scales is

of course still maintained by the free energy in the background density gradient, and the energy

12

n
n
b
on drift scale density ﬂuctuations is even increased by the destabilising magnetic ﬂutter effect

on the non-adiabatic parallel dynamics. The cascade in density structures is generally a three-

wave interaction that is on statistical grounds essentially down to smaller scales, but is by more

infrequent events also able to feed scales in the m =

1 geodesic sidebands and the m = 0 zonal

±

mode. The geodesic transfer pathway is thus open in both directions: a strong drive of the GAM

mode by zonal ﬂows for low beta on the average drains energy out of the ﬂow to smaller scales.
For high beta the GAM energy is, however, converted to a certain extend into ˜f oscillations that

supply the zonal ﬂows.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have performed a detailed investigation of the zonal ﬂow drive in drift-Alfvn turbulence for

parameters relevant to the edge region of hot plasmas in toroidal devices. We have identiﬁed three

main mechanisms for the interaction of the zonal ﬂows with the turbulent ﬂuctuations; namely

the electrostatic Reynolds stress, the electromagnetic Maxwell stress, and the geodesic acoustic

mode, GAM, coupling. The main results are summarized as follows: For low beta cases the

Maxwell stress is negligible and the Reynolds stress is the only driving term of the ﬂow, whereas

the GAM coupling provides a sink for the ﬂow in addition to the viscousity. For the case of high-

beta plasmas, however, the Maxwell stress becomes signiﬁcant. It acts as a sink for all the cases

we have investigated, and it efﬁciently cancels the driving effect of the Reynolds stress. In this

parameter regime the ﬂow is mainly sustained by the GAM coupling, that now acts as a drive

opposing the viscous damping.

We should therefore emphasize that from an experimental point of view, measuring Reynolds

stress exclusively as an indication for ﬂow generation is in general not sufﬁcient. The electro-

magnetic Maxwell stress is important already at a moderate edge beta parameter, and will be even
more important for ITER like plasmas with higher edge b at reduced collisionality. This clearly

opens a demand for additional measurements of the Maxwell stress.

There is a clear trend in the computational results that assign more importance to the GAM

oscillation at a high level of transport. The GAMs present a driving mechanism for the ﬂows if the

transport is sufﬁciently inhomogeneous: with an increasing ballooning character of the turbulence

the GAMs are further excited and can ultimately drive ﬂows.

The frequency spectra of the zonal ﬂow clearly show a dip or a peak in the w GAM frequency

13

range, depending on the sink or drive role of the GAMs for the ﬂow evolution. Measurements

of the frequency spectrum of the zonal ﬂow should thus be able to distinguish between these two

scenarios and provide further insight into the importance of GAMs for the ﬂow, and ﬁnally for

H-mode formation.

Finally we note that our numerical results are for the high beta case partially in disagreement

with recent results by B. Scott [11] regarding the speciﬁc role of the Maxwell stress [29].

Strongly coupled large-angle stimulated Raman scattering (LA SRS) of a short intense laser
pulse proceeds in a plane plasma-ﬁlled capillary diﬀerently than in a plasma with open boundaries.
Oblique mirror reﬂections oﬀ capillary walls partly suppress the lateral convection of scattered
radiation and increase the growth rate of the instability: the convective gain of the LA SRS falls
with an angle much slower than in an unbounded plasma and even for the near-forward SRS can
be close to that of the direct backscatter. The long-term evolution of LA SRS in the interior of
the capillary is dominated by quasi-one-dimensional leaky modes, whose damping is related to the
transmission of electromagnetic waves through capillary walls.

INTRODUCTION

Progress of the chirped-pulse ampliﬁcation (CPA)
technique [1] achieved in the two last decades has made
short-pulse (sub-picosecond) high-power (P > 1012W )
lasers available for electron acceleration [2, 3, 4] and gen-
eration of coherent X-rays [5] and high harmonics of ra-

4πe2n0/me is the electron

rest). In order to discover full potential of these appli-
cations, one has to increase the laser-plasma interaction
length beyond the Rayleigh diﬀraction length of a focus-

2πc/ω0 is a laser
0/λ0 (where λ0 ≈
wavelength, and r0 is a radius of a laser beam waist),
which is only possible with some form of optical guid-
ing [4]. One of the options widely acknowledged nowa-
days is guiding by means of a dielectric (glass) capil-
lary [7], which can be evacuated [8], ﬁlled with a ho-
mogeneous plasma [9], or contain a plasma channel in-
side [10]. In the interior of a capillary, mirror reﬂections
oﬀ the walls suppress the diﬀraction of radiation, which,
unfortunately, does not yet ensure the stability of the
laser pulse propagation. In a capillary ﬁlled with a rar-
eﬁed plasma, stimulated Raman scattering under large
angles (LA SRS) remains the major challenge for a long-
distance transportation of laser radiation [11].

In the conventional SRS process [12] the laser beam
(pump) is scattered by spontaneous ﬂuctuations of elec-

tron density, which, in turn, can be ampliﬁed by the pon-
deromotive beatwave of pump and scattered radiation.
Certain phase matching of the waves results in a positive
feedback loop and the onset of a spatio-temporal instabil-
ity [13]. When plasma extent is much larger than a laser
pulse length, the wave interaction is localized in an area
much smaller than a plasma volume. In the absence of
reﬂecting surfaces, both scattering electron plasma waves
(EPW) and scattered electromagnetic (EM) waves quit
the region of ampliﬁcation, and the convective gain sat-
urates within a time period of the order of pulse dura-
tion [14, 15, 16, 17]. Then, the length of a laser pulse
given, the maximum possible ampliﬁcation factor is the
same for all scattering angles [14, 15, 17], and whether
it is achieved or not for a given angle is determined by
the laser pulse aspect ratio only [14, 15, 16, 17]. Con-
vection of scattered radiation out of the laser waist may
result in a strong depletion a laser pulse [18]. Even in the
case when the full depletion does not occur, the LA SRS
makes for the pulse erosion [19], suppression of the rela-
tivistic self-focusing [20], heating and pre-acceleration of
plasma electrons [21] due to wavebreaking of Raman plas-
mon [22], and seeding the forward SRS [23, 24]. Ability
to theoretically predict the SRS dynamics under certain
physical conditions is therefore vital for applications of
short-pulse intense lasers.

In the presence of reﬂecting surfaces, which do not al-
low the waves to quit the interaction area, the LA SRS
is substantially modiﬁed. In a 1D plasma slab with re-
ﬂecting boundaries the nature of the Raman backscatter
changes from convective to absolute [25]: reﬂections trap
the unstable modes inside the slab and give rise to the
continuous ampliﬁcation. In the 2D plasma laterally con-
ﬁned between partly transparent walls (which is a model
for a plasma-ﬁlled capillary), oblique mirror reﬂections
reduce the sideward convection of scattered light. The
gain factor of the LA SRS experiences a dramatic in-

crease in comparison with the case of an open-boundary
system, and more homogeneous proﬁle of scattered radi-
ation sets in across a capillary [11].

SRS in plasmas bounded with reﬂecting surfaces [11,
25] has been considered so far in the regime of weak cou-
pling. In this regime, the scattering EPW is similar to
the plasma natural mode [13], and temporal growth rate
is kept well below the electron plasma frequency. The lat-
ter condition requires fairly low intensity of a laser pulse,
i.e., a0 ≪
1 [a0 = eE0/(meω0c) is a normal-
ized amplitude of the laser electric ﬁeld], which is clearly
irrelevant for the contemporary experiments conducted
1) [4]. The
at sub-relativistic laser intensities (a0 ≤
recent attempt to use a capillary-guided sub-relativistic
laser pulse for the self-modulated laser wakeﬁeld acceler-
ation of electrons (SM LWFA) [3] was undertaken in the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) [26]. In this ex-
periment, zero yield of fast electrons had been detected.
Particle simulations we made earlier by means of the
code WAKE [27], as well as independent ﬂuid simula-
tions [28], showed enormous enhancement of the near-
forward and sideward SRS inside a capillary, which did
not allow formation of a well-deﬁned plasma wake suit-
able for the longitudinal electron acceleration. To explain
this phenomenon, a nonlinear theory of LA SRS in later-
ally bounded plasmas should be developed with the em-
phasis on the non-resonant strong coupling (SC) regime,
a0 >
ωpe/ω0, with the temporal growth rate exceeding
ωpe and scattering plasma modes diﬀerent from the nat-
ural mode of plasma oscillations [14, 17, 23, 29, 30]. To
make a step in this direction, we propose here a 2D linear
theory of SC LA SRS of a short laser pulse in a plane cap-
illary ﬁlled with a rareﬁed homogeneous plasma, which
complements previous studies [17] of this instability in
an open-boundary system. Combined with the earlier
results [11], the present work completes the linear theory
of LA SRS in plasma-ﬁlled plane capillaries.

p

Using the basic theoretical formalism developed by
Turano and McKinstrie [11] we show that the eﬀect of
oblique mirror reﬂections does not alter the convective
nature of the instability, and the gain of the LA SRS of a
ﬁnite-length laser pulse saturates within a ﬁnite distance
from the entrance plane. Due to the reﬂections, unstable
modes receive additional time to grow and are ampliﬁed
much stronger than in an open-boundary system. At
a large distance in a plasma, the structure of unstable
ﬁeld is approximated fairly well by the quasi-1D damped
mode. The eﬀective damping of the mode is produced by
the leakage of radiation through the partly transparent
capillary walls. Even for relatively small scattering an-
gles, the convective gain for this mode can be quite close
to that of the backward SRS (BSRS). This eﬀect will
prevent formation of a plasma wakeﬁeld with a narrow
angular spectrum in any experimental attempt of real-
ization of SM LWFA with capillary guiding. Therefore,
the LA SRS is the principal obstacle for the success of
such experiments.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II we

present the basic equations describing the SC LA SRS
in a rareﬁed plasma in a plane 2D geometry and pose
the boundary-value problem which takes account of both
laser pulse entrance into a plasma and mirror reﬂections
of scattered radiation oﬀ the capillary walls. General so-
lution of the boundary-value problem is derived in terms
of a row expansion in powers of the reﬂection coeﬃ-
cient. Technical details of derivation are given in Ap-

evolution of waves.
In Subsection III A, we consider
the LA SRS evolution in an area with fully transpar-
ent boundaries, and complement the results of Ref. 17.
In Subsection III B we address to the generic case of a
capillary with partly transparent walls. We discover the
overall enhancement of the SC LA SRS and establish
predominantly 1D behavior of waves within the ampli-
ﬁcation area, which is in agreement with the earlier re-
sults [11]. In Subsection III C we ﬁnd that complete sup-
pression of lateral convection inside a capillary with fully
reﬂecting walls makes the evolution of waves strictly one-
dimensional (with variation allowed in the longitudinal
direction only). In this case, regardless of the scattering
angle, the convective gain reaches the maximum possible
value corresponding to the BSRS. In Sec. IV, we present
the long-term asymptotic behavior of unstable waves and
determine the eﬀective growth rate of the SC LA SRS in-
side a capillary (derivation is given in Appendix B). The
results are summarized in Sec. V.

In the non-reﬂective case, i.e., r(α)
0, up- and down-
going waves are independent, and their evolution in both
weak and strong coupling regimes is known [15, 17]. For
r > 0, the amplitude equations for up- and down-going
waves become coupled by virtue of the reﬂective bound-
ary conditions (4c), (4d). The reﬂected waves form addi-
tional lateral “reﬂective” sources for the instability. The
source amplitudes grow with time and, at large z, as
we shall see in Sections III and IV, make for the domi-
nance of quasi-1D exponential-like behavior of waves in
the whole interaction volume.

The principal feature that makes the SRS of a short
pulse [17] diﬀerent from the case of a semi-inﬁnite laser
beam [15] is the gain saturation within a ﬁnite distance
from the entrance plane. Physically, this means that at
some point z in a plasma EM waves scattered from the
plasma boundary z = 0 drop behind the laser pulse so
that neither part of the pulse belongs to the zone III.
Therefore, in all the points z through the rest of the
plasma the SRS evolution is exactly the same, and the
ampliﬁcation factor does not change with z. We outline
below how the gain saturates for the “forward” (α < π/2)
and “backward” (α > π/2) scattering.

Note, that κ = γtemp/c is the known “spatial” increment
of SC BSRS in the co-moving variables [4, 14, 16, 17, 23,
30]. On this stage of evolution, the instability is seeded
by the noise in a fresh plasma ahead of the pulse (this
noise source is homogeneous across the capillary), and
the evolution of waves is strictly one-dimensional. Later,
information from the boundaries x = 0, z = 0, reaches
the point (x, z), and the spatial dependence becomes ei-
ther 2D for ξ > x/Vx, x < z(Vx/Vz) (zone II) or 1D for
ξ > z/Vz, x > z(Vx/Vz) (zone III). The waves are not
exponentially growing at this time. In the zone III the
eﬀect of laser pulse entrance into a plasma dominates,
the one-dimensional amplitudes growing from the noise
at the plasma boundary z = 0. Deep enough in a plasma,

the pulse terminates earlier than radiation scattered from
z = 0 can reach the observer at a given z, and the en-

between the zones I and II, and the evolution of LA SRS
remains the same at any point z through the rest of the
plasma.

For α > π/2, no information from the entrance plane
can reach the plasma in the interior of the capillary. The

As soon as the growth stabilization sets in, and the
pulse duration is given, the maximum possible gain is in-
dependent on the scattering angle. Whether it is achieved
for a given scattering angle depends solely on the pulse
aspect ratio [17]. If the pulse is wide, or the scattering

which do not diﬀract out of the pulse receive the strongest
ampliﬁcation (qualitatively, this criterium was proposed
by Shvets et al. [34]). Therefore, the angular spectrum of
scattered radiation is prescribed by the pulse aspect ra-
tio rather than the angular dependence of the increment.

tion of the laser pulse due to the LA SRS, it is suﬃcient
to neglect the radiation scattered at angles smaller than
α0 [36]. These basic results of the non-reﬂective theory
are helpful for understanding the LA SRS evolution in
a generic case with multiple reﬂections of EM waves oﬀ
capillary walls.

B. Generic case of partly reﬂecting walls

The areas of wave evolution are shown in Fig. 4. In
Eqs. (5), (6), the terms with r0 form the non-reﬂective
solution discussed above. The basic three zones of
growth (7) for the non-reﬂective solution are divided in
Fig. 4 by the bold solid lines. The terms proportional to
rn represent a contribution from the nth reﬂection into
the generic reﬂective solution. Each of these terms has
three regions of growth divided by the lines (7) with x
replaced by x + nLx (in Fig. 4 these lines are dashed).
Within the zones I and III, the amplitudes are exactly
the same as in the non-reﬂective theory because no re-
ﬂections from the boundaries ξ = 0 and z = 0 occur.
Hence, the characteristics (7) still divide the basic zones
I, II, and III. In the zone II the solution is completely
modiﬁed by the reﬂections and is characterized by either
1D exponential + 2D gamma-like growth or 1D + 2D
gamma-like growth depending on whether ξ < z/Vz or
ξ > z/Vz. These 1D contributions originate from the re-
ﬂections with n

Sec. II that in the zone II the instability has additional

FIG. 5: Spatio-temporal evolution of up-going EPW (5b) in
the ﬁeld of transversely limited laser pulse of ﬁnite duration.
The scattering angle is α = π/6. The laser pulse aspect ratio
is ct0/Lx = 2. Temporal evolution of the amplitudes is traced
at the longitudinal positions (a), (b) z = 0.25ct0, (c), (d)
z = 1.5ct0, and (e), (f ) z = 6.5ct0. Figures in the left column
correspond to the reﬂective case with r = 0.42 (plane glass
capillary with a refraction coeﬃcient δw = 1.5, see Fig. 3).
The right column presents the SRS evolution within an area
with open boundaries (r = 0).

Comparing our results with conclusions of the reﬂec-
tive theory for semi-inﬁnite laser pulses [11], we again
emphasize the principal eﬀect of the pulse ﬁnite duration.
Despite the additional growth of the unstable modes in
the zone II due to the lateral reﬂections, the SRS gain
remains ﬁnite at any point z in plasma. This occurs be-
cause the backward (and, partly, sideward) convection of
waves is still allowed. The laser pulse outruns the radi-
ation scattered oﬀ the plasma boundary z = 0, and the
instability saturates within a ﬁnite distance in a plasma:

FIG. 4: Regions of temporal growth for the SRS under the
angle α = π/6 at the longitudinal positions (a) z = 0.25ct0
and (b) z = 1.5ct0, (c) z = 6.5ct0. The thick solid lines [x =
z(Vx/Vz), ξ = z/Vz, and ξ = x/Vx] divide the principal zones
of the wave growth prescribed by the non-reﬂective theory.
The dashed lines show the characteristics for the reﬂected
waves x + nLx = z(Vx/Vz), ξ = z/Vz, and ξ = (x + nLx)/Vx.
The number of reﬂections which contribute to the scattering
process is one for the case (a), two for the case (b), seven for
the case (c).

“reﬂective” sources located at the lateral boundaries, the
source amplitudes growing with time. As a consequence,
the amplitudes given by the reﬂective theory in the region
II are larger than in a non-reﬂective case and reveal less
pronounced lateral variation. Hence, for large z (many
reﬂections), 1D modes should be dominant in the zone

ωpe/ω0 = 0.007. For these parameters, the maximum

ing angle α = π/6 is taken. The capillary cross-sections
are placed at (a), (b) z = 0.25ct0, (c), (d) z = 1.5ct0, and
(e), (f ) z = 6.5ct0. The plots (a), (c), (e) are obtained
for the reﬂective case, and plots (b), (d), (f ) — for the
non-reﬂective case. For the plots (a), (c), (e), the re-
ﬂection coeﬃcient is r = 0.42, which corresponds to the
glass with a coeﬃcient of refraction δw = 1.5 and can be
retrieved from Fig. 3 for α = π/6. The regions of growth
for the plots (a), (c), (e) are shown in Figs. 4(a), (b), (c),
respectively.

As is seen in Figs. 5(a), (b), the eﬀect of laser pulse
entrance into a plasma dominates the SRS evolution at
the point z = 0.25ct0. Reﬂective and non-reﬂective the-
ories give very similar results in this case. According to
Fig. 4(a), the major part of the pulse body belongs to
the zone III, where the solution is represented by 1D
modes corresponding to the waves scattered oﬀ the cap-
illary entrance plane z = 0. The only diﬀerence between
Figs. 5(a) and (b) is seen in the in the vicinity of the
lateral boundary x = 0 (zone II). The reﬂective bound-
ary conditions (4c), (4d) do not allow the solution to
vanish in this zone, and the 1D contribution from the
reﬂected modes is clearly seen in the proximity of x = 0
in Fig. 5(a).

In a more distant point, z = 1.5ct0, reﬂective and non-
reﬂective solutions are vastly diﬀerent [Figs. 5(c), (d)].
Waves from the entrance plane cannot reach this point
within a time period t0, and, as is seen in Fig. 4(b), the
pulse body is divided between the zones I and II. The
major portion of the pulse body belongs to the zone II,
so that contribution from the reﬂections becomes impor-
tant. Contribution from just two reﬂective modes [see
Fig. 4(b)] increases the EPW amplitude by more than
an order of magnitude [Fig. 5(c)] if compared with the
non-reﬂective case [Fig. 5(d)]. The reﬂected waves reduce
two-dimensional character of the LA SRS: the EPW am-
plitude becomes almost one-dimensional [Fig. 5(c)].

Figs. 5(c) and(e)]. Fig. 5(e) displays the saturated so-
lution of the reﬂective problem. Seven reﬂections con-
tributing to the solution beyond z = 6.5ct0 [in accor-
dance with Fig. 4(c)] rebuild the EPW amplitude com-
pletely if compared with the non-reﬂective case [Fig. 5(f )]
and make it almost one-dimensional. The ampliﬁca-
tion factor becomes fairly close to that of the BSRS,

tive damping rate and keeps the ampliﬁcation factor be-
low this limiting value. This observation points out that,
at a large distance from the capillary entrance plane, a re-
ally cumbersome exact solution (5) should admit a specif-
ically simple approximation via quasi-1D damped mode
with a temporal growth rate close to (8). This long-term
asymptotic is derived in the Appendix B and presented
in the next Section.

C. Case of fully reﬂecting walls

To accomplish the analysis based on the exact solution
of the boundary-value problem, we show that a total sup-
pression of the transverse convection results in a strictly
1D behavior of the instability. Indeed, r = 1 makes the
general solution (5) purely 1D in space:

Fully reﬂecting walls completely conﬁne the waves in the
interior of the capillary so that up- and down-going am-
plitudes become identical. For ξ < z/Vz these 1D ampli-
tudes grow in time exponentially with a maximum pos-
sible increment (8). Deep in a plasma [see Eq. (10)], the
convective gain is the same as for the direct backscatter,
as+, N+ ∼

exp(γtempt0).

IV. LONG-TERM ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR
OF THE 2D ENVELOPES

To facilitate applications of our analysis, we present
here a long-term asymptotic solution, which perfectly
approximates the exact solution of the reﬂective prob-
lem and describes in simple terms its quasi-1D nature
at large distances from the capillary entrance plane and
large gains (γtempt0 > 1). The principal assumption used
for derivation of the asymptotic is that the energy loss of
scattered radiation due to leakage through the capillary
wall at one reﬂection is smaller than the energy gain on
the way between the two walls, that is,

r > exp(

3GLx/Vx).

−

(11)

Therefore, the scattered light is mostly trapped inside a
capillary. We concentrate here on the asymptotic growth
of the convectively unstable modes, and assume that the
inequality (10) is valid. Then, the wave amplitudes are
G−1, admit the following
independent on z and, for ξ

(N0/3) exp (γtempξ/c) and the
exact non-reﬂective solution, respectively, providing the
upper and lower limits of the convective gain variation.
The leakage of radiation out of the capillary does not
allow the reﬂective solution to achieve the BSRS ampli-
ﬁcation factor. However, contribution from the reﬂec-
tions increases the gain by almost two orders of magni-
tude (compare solid and dotted lines). Fig. 6 shows that
strong enhancement of the SRS under moderate angles
(such as α
π/6, in our example) should be expected
within a capillary tube under the conditions of real-scale
experiment [26]. This eﬀect leads to very pessimistic pre-
dictions on possible excitation of regular self-modulated
laser wake-ﬁeld, which could be suitable for electron ac-
celeration in capillaries.

∼

V. CONCLUSION

We have proposed a 2D non-stationary linear theory
of strongly coupled LA SRS of a short laser pulse in a
plasma-ﬁlled plane capillary.
In the inner part of the
capillary the lateral convection of scattered light is partly
suppressed by the oblique reﬂections, which is followed
by the great enhancement of the instability. The convec-
tive nature of LA SRS does not change. The long-term
behavior of the waves demonstrates the transition from
the set of 2D modes to the dominant quasi-1D damped
mode. Even for near-forward scattering the convective
gain of the dominant quasi-1D mode may be close to the
BSRS gain. Vast enhancement of the near-forward SRS
under the condition of the present-day experiments on
capillary-guided SM LWFA makes perspectives of these
experiments very questionable.

lateral growth of the asymptotic is much slower than
the growth with ξ provided the condition (11) is ful-
ﬁlled [this eﬀect is also clearly seen in the exact solu-
tion, Fig. 5(c), (e)]. The eﬀective damping rate ∆κ
≪
γtemp/c is associated with a leakage of scattered radiation
through partly reﬂecting walls. Solutions (12) display the
basic result of the reﬂective theory of LA SRS: at large
distances from the entrance plane and large coeﬃcients
of ampliﬁcation the amplitudes of unstable waves tend
to quasi-1D leaky modes exponentially growing in time
with the increment tending to (8).

In Fig. 6 we trace the temporal evolution of the up-
going electron plasma wave in the point x = Lx, z =
6.5ct0, all the parameters being exactly the same as of
Fig. 5(e). This plot proves that the asymptotic (12a)
approximates almost perfectly the exact reﬂective solu-
tion (5b). The solid and dashed lines, which represent ex-
act (5b) and asymptotic (12a) reﬂective solutions, nearly
coincide, so that for most applications this asymptotic
may be used instead of the exact solution. The dash-
dotted and dotted curves correspond in Fig. 6 to the

Now, using (B3), we ﬁnd the asymptotic A2(x, ξ
).
Neither s = cj (where Γs = 0) nor s = 0 are the singular-
ities of (B3), so contributions to the asymptotic originate
from the singular points sn only, which are the solutions
of the equation Γsn = ˜νn [here, ˜νn = (Vx/Vz)(
ln r +
2πin)/Lx], or s3
iG3 = 0, n is integer. The
n −
absolute value of ˜νn grows with n, so we need to eval-
uate the contribution from the points sn with large n.
We solve the above cubic equation using a perturba-
tion approach [the small parameter is µn = G/(

If a point z is far enough in a plasma, or a pulse is suﬃ-
ciently short to satisfy the condition (10), the asymptotic
solution within a pulse body is determined solely by the
term A2(x, ξ).
In this case, the amplitudes of the un-
stable waves within a pulse body are evaluated by the
formulas (12) which express the dominating role of the
1D exponentially growing modes in the LA SRS evolution
in a plasma with reﬂecting lateral boundaries.

Abstract. Measurements of force generated by a positive unipolar wire-to-plane corona discharge in air
are compared with numerical simulations. The generated force does not depend on the ion or electron mo-
bilities, preventing the inﬂuence of uncertainty and variation of these parameters. A method is described
to simulate the voltage and charge distribution for a wire-to-plane set-up. This method enables the deter-
mination of the transition between unipolar and bipolar discharges. In the experimental set-up breakdown
electric ﬁeld of air reduces with increasing discharge current.

1 Introduction

Atmospheric pressure corona discharges in air are impor-
tant for use as electrostatic precipitators, ozone genera-
tors [1], thunderclouds [2], mass transport [3] and so on.
An upcoming ﬁeld is the use of corona discharge to gener-
ate electric winds for cooling purposes [4]. The physics of
corona discharge however is not fully understood. Peek [5]
was one of the ﬁrst to study the phenomenon in a system-
atic way. He found the onset breakdown electric ﬁeld at
the wire surface of a wire-cylinder discharge corresponds
to

where f is an irregularity factor (for polished copper wire

kV/cm, δ the relative density of the air compared to the
density of air at 25 oC and 1013 kPa, a the wire radius
and ao a constant equal to 0.0949 cm. In this paper the
outer edge of the corona is deﬁned as the distance to the
center of the wire, rc where the electric ﬁeld equals the
breakdown electric ﬁeld. In the corona between wire sur-
face and outer corona edge it is assumed that space charge
has negligible inﬂuence on the electric ﬁeld. This is a valid
assumption as close to the wire the electric ﬁeld gradient
is already very large due to geometry. Then, according to
equation (1) the corona size is given by

rc = a +

This can be calculated by using equation (11) with α(x) =
1. The second term at the right hand side of this equa-
tion represents the ionisation sheath. In this sheath the

discharge is carried by electrons, positive and negative
ions [6]. Outside this sheath the discharge is mainly unipo-
lar. A recent overview of possible electrical breakdown cri-
teria has been given by Lowke [7]. He couples ao to the
discharge parameters of air

where Q is the number of ionisations to occur to sustain
breakdown, No is the air number density at 25 oC and
1016 V−2m−2 1. Q depends on
1013 kPa and B is 1.35
the corona discharge mechanism. He suggests a possible
mechanism for the onset corona discharge but does not
take into account the eﬀect of space charge in the air sur-
rounding the corona. Normally this is not a problem as
measurements of the breakdown electric ﬁeld of air are
mostly done for relatively small space charges at rela-
tively small discharge currents. However, for the above-
mentioned applications the breakdown electric ﬁeld in the
presence of a discharge current is important. Additional
problems are the relative uncertainties of the mobility of
the involved ions and electrons. In the following it is shown
that the force generated by a wire-to-plane corona dis-
charge is independent of charge carrier mobilities. This
force only depends on the applied potential diﬀerence be-
tween wire and plane and the geometry of the discharge.
Force measurements were performed to determine the in-
ﬂuence of space charge on the breakdown electric ﬁeld of
air at atmospheric pressure and to eliminate the inﬂu-
ence of the charge carrier mobilities. In the following this

method is described and measurements for several geome-
tries are presented and discussed.

2 Outline of the method

The method is based on solving the Poisson equation for
certain geometry combined with the continuity equations
for ion and electron ﬂow. Solving Poisson equation gives
the potential distribution, U and the continuity equations
give the space charge distribution, ρ. In air (the relative
permittivity, ǫr is approximated by 1) the Poisson equa-
tion is

where ǫo is the permittivity of free space. For each charge
species i, being positive or negative ions or electrons, the
stationary continuity equation is

2U =

ρ
ǫo

.Ji = 0 ,

where Ji is the current density of charge species i. It is
assumed that no transformation from one species into an-
other occurs. If the mobility, µi of the species does not de-
pend on either space charge nor electric ﬁeld, E =
U
it is given by

−∇

where ρi is the charge density of species i. Hence, equa-
tion (5) reduces to

Ji = µi

Adding all equations (7) results in the continuity equation

The force exerted by the electric ﬁeld on a point particle
with charge q is by deﬁnition F = qE. This can be ex-
tended to ﬁnd the force exerted by the electric ﬁeld on a
charge density distribution in a volume V :

F =

ρEdV .

Z

Neither equation (4) nor (8) contains any reference to
the mobility of the involved ions or electrons, other then
that they are constant. The simultaneous solution of these
equations results in voltage and charge density distribu-
tions independent of these parameters. Hence according
to equation (9) the force exerted by the charge distribu-
tion does not depend on the mobilities. Further, this force
is uniquely determined by the applied voltage diﬀerence
between wire and plane and the geometry. The electric
current, I through some ﬂat area A is given by

where n is the normal to area A. The current consists of
contributions from all charge species. Hence, it is much
more diﬃcult to calculate accurately than the force. Fur-
ther, if the total charge distribution consists of positive
and negative species, the current increases as indicated
by the absolute sign.

3 Experimental set-up

The detection of force exerted by a space charge distri-
bution needs equation (9) to produce a result diﬀerent
from 0. This can be achieved by an asymmetrical corona
discharge, like a wire-to-plane discharge. Normal the wire
is put above and parallel to the plane. Then, the electric
wind generated by the space charge will push against the
plane and reduce the measurable force [8]. To overcome
this problem, the plane is reduced to a sheet and the wire
is put parallel to the sheet at a distance S. The wire is po-
sitioned in the same plane as the sheet. H is the height of
the sheet (4.0 cm in the experiments). This conﬁguration
is shown in ﬁgure 1. Sheet thickness was 2 mm, far less
than either S or H. The upper and lower end of the sheet
were smoothly rounded with a radius of 1 mm to as much
as possible avoid production of opposite signed charges.
The length of both wire and sheet was 53.5 cm. In the ex-
periment S was varied between 2.0 and 6.0 cm with steps
of 1.0 cm. Wires of diﬀerent radius a were used: 0.040,
0.0635, 0.075, 0.10, 0.1575 and 0.25 mm. Measurements
1 oC and
were performed at atmospheric conditions: 20
1013
10 kPa. Relative humidity was between 0.5 and
0.8. The force was measured by the reduction of weight
of the set-up with a lever. One arm of the lever was con-
nected with light non-conducting wires attached to the
set-up. The length of these wires was about 50 cm ensur-
ing the inﬂuence of the surroundings was negligible. The
other arm was rigidly connected to a balance with a range
of 100 gram and an accuracy of 0.1 gram. The ratio of
the length of the arms of the lever was 1:10. This lever
enabled force measurements between 0 and 100 mN with
an accuracy of 0.1 mN. The measurements were done with
increasing and decreasing voltages to check for systematic
deviations. A DC high voltage between 0 and 30 kV was
applied to the wire while the sheet was grounded. An am-
pere meter monitored the current supplied by the high
voltage power supply.

4 Simulation

To simulate the electric ﬁeld a model was developed fol-
lowing [9]. First, the problem is reduced to 2 dimensions
by assuming an inﬁnitely long wire and sheet. Second,
the problem is made periodic in both x- and y-directions
with a period of 2Wx and Wy respectively. 2Wx respec-
tively Wy being the distance in x-respectively y-direction
between two adjacent set-ups. x = Wx and the x = 0
are symmetry axis. If Wx and Wy are large enough the
results can be applied to a single set-up. Here, Wx and
Wy are chosen optimizing the computation time and re-
quired accuracy. Third, the problem is discretized by as-
suming a square grid with spacing ∆. The number of grid
lines in the x-direction, n equals Wx/∆ + 1, the number in
the y-direction, m equals Wy/∆. Fourth, the appropriate
boundary conditions are deﬁned and the discretized ver-
sion of equations (4) and (8) are solved sequentially until a
stable solution is found. For the solution of the discretized
Poisson equation a Poisson solver was used based on the
linear conjugate gradients method [10]. For the solution of
the descritized continuity equation a non-linear conjugate
gradient method was used [11]. The appropriate bound-
ary conditions are not evident. At the sheet the potential
was simply set to 0. At the wire position however, the
wire radius had to be taken into account. As the wire ra-
dius is very small compared with the grid size a method
had to be devised to take it into account. The method
as described in [9] was used and extended to incorporate
unipolar space charge around the wire. Around the wire
up to the ﬁrst adjacent grid point cylindrical geometry is
assumed. This is justiﬁed as ∆
S. The space charge
density at r = rc is taken to be ρc. Then, the electric ﬁeld
and charge density near the wire are given by

5 Results and discussion

where µ is the mobility of the unipolar charge carriers.
Note that η is determined by the experimental conditions
only. A graph of the electric ﬁeld as function of r for several
η is shown in ﬁgure 2. The theoretical maximum value for
η is 1. For η = 1 the electric ﬁeld in the whole gap equals
the breakdown electric ﬁeld and there is no way to prevent
spark discharge. For r/rc < 1 the lines coincide. Inside the
corona the electric ﬁeld gradient due to the space charge
density is negligible compared to the geometric gradient.
For all experiments η < 0.05, so the inﬂuence of the space
charge on the electric ﬁeld is negligible near the wire up

The wire voltage was calculated by adding ∆U (∆) + ∆Uc
to the average of the voltage at the wire adjacent grid
points. From the simulations the spread in the voltages at
these grid point was only a few percent. This indicates the
accuracy of the assumption of cylindrical geometry near
the wire up to the ﬁrst grid point. f was determined by
ﬁtting the onset breakdown electric ﬁeld to equation (1).
For the onset rc was calculated with equation (2). As an
example, the onset voltage distribution for S = 3.0 cm
and a = 0.040 mm is shown in ﬁgure 4. The position of

the wire and sheet are evident. Notice the steep rice at
the wire position. The wire onset voltage was 5.82 kV.
In this case the corona radius according to equation (2)
is 0.235 mm. The corona voltage drop according to equa-
tion (14) was (f = 1) 1290 V. In the simulation the voltage
at the wire position equals the voltage at the outside of
the corona. Hence, in the simulation the voltage at the
wire position was 4.53 kV. The ﬁtted irregularity factors
are shown in table 1. The onset voltages varied between
5 and 12 kV. The average irregularity factor is 0.86, this
indicates that the used value of Eo is slightly too high.
Using a value of 27 kV/cm instead of 31 kV/cm, increases
the average irregularity factor to 0.99. The small spread
in the ﬁtted value of the irregularity factor is evidence for
the correctness of the performed simulation. Using these
irregularity factors, at every measured voltage and geom-
etry the simulated force was ﬁtted to the measured one
by adjusting rc and ρc. Both parameters are needed to
determine the force at a certain voltage and geometry. All
other parameters were taken from the experimental condi-
tions. Figure 5 shows an example of a voltage distribution
for ρc = 128 µ Cm−3 (which corresponds to a unipolar
discharge current of 0.1 mA/m, if µ = 2.0 cm2V−1s−1)
with the same geometry as in ﬁgure 4. Figure 6 shows an
example of the corresponding space charge density distri-

surements are within the accuracy of the measurements.
Note that both force and discharge current measurements
are accurately calculated with the same space charge den-
sity distribution. For the force this is a result of the ﬁt. For
the discharge current this is not evident, as the currents
were not used in the ﬁts. Force is a volume and current an
area integral over a charge and electric ﬁeld distribution
corresponding to equation 9 and 10 respectively. Hence,
good agreement between the measured and simulated dis-
charge current is a further indication of the validity of this
method. For larger voltage the measured discharge cur-
rent grows faster than the simulated one. Here, the cur-
rent measurements with increasing and decreasing volt-
age starts to deviate slightly. This is caused by a change
of the discharge from unipolar to bipolar. The charges of
the other sign reduce the force but enhance the current.
From the ﬁtted rc the corresponding values of √ao are
calculated using equation (2). They are shown in ﬁgures 9
and 10. The vertical lines in the graphs show the max-
imum force for which the simulated current matched the
measured one. This is the maximum force for a unipolar
discharge in the speciﬁed geometry. √ao decreases from
the onset value of 0.0308 m0.5 more or less linear with
a slope dependent on the geometry. The slope is propor-
tional to S. For diﬀerent wire diameters the slope is ap-
proximately the same. The reduction of √ao corresponds
to a reduction of the electric ﬁeld at the wire position. In
literature this is attributed to a reduction of the break-
down electric ﬁeld of air dependent on the applied over
voltage [12,13]. The physics behind this are not yet un-
derstood. The reduction of √ao to 0 corresponds, accord-
ing to equation (3), to a reduction of Q to 1. The number
of needed ionisations reduces to 1. The slope’s indepen-

they do not signiﬁcantly change the results presented here.

dence of a and its proportionality to S suggest Q depends
on the total amount of charge present in the discharge
and not on local conditions around the wire. Lowke pro-
poses the breakdown of air is caused by ions produced by
interaction of metastable molecules. The eﬀect presented
here supports his conclusion, as the number of metastable
molecules present in the air depends on the charge density.
The measurements presented here are not accurate enough
to determine the mechanism of this dependence. For larger
forces, where the discharge becomes bipolar, √ao becomes
negative, indicating the limit of equation (8). This equa-

tion assumes no transformation of one charge species into
another. This is further supported by the observed trend
that for larger interaction times of the charge species (i.e.
for large traveling distance of the charges) √ao becomes
negative for smaller forces.

6 Conclusions

Force generated by an asymmetrical wire-to-plane dis-
charge can be measured and accurately simulated. Com-
parison of measurements of both force-voltage and current-
voltage characteristics with ﬁnite diﬀerences simulations
show good agreement for the unipolar region. These mea-
surements can be used to determine the transition voltage
of an unipolar into a bipolar discharge. Further, it is possi-
ble to determine the breakdown electric ﬁeld of air depen-
dent on the discharge conditions. The presented measure-
ments are in qualitative agreement with the breakdown
mechanism as proposed by Lowke, but measurements are
not accurate enough to determine the dependence of this
mechanism on the space charge density distribution.

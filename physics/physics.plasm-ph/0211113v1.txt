We analyze random walk through fractal environments, embedded in 3–dimensional, permeable space.
Particles travel freely and are scattered oﬀ into random directions when they hit the fractal. The statistical
distribution of the ﬂight increments (i.e. of the displacements between two consecutive hittings) is analytically
derived from a common, practical deﬁnition of fractal dimension, and it turns out to approximate quite well
a power-law in the case where the dimension DF of the fractal is less than 2, there is though always a
ﬁnite rate of unaﬀected escape. Random walks through fractal sets with DF ≤ 2 can thus be considered
as defective Levy walks. The distribution of jump increments for DF > 2 is decaying exponentially. The
diﬀusive behavior of the random walk is analyzed in the frame of continuous time random walk, which we
generalize to include the case of defective distributions of walk-increments. It is shown that the particles
undergo anomalous, enhanced diﬀusion for DF < 2, the diﬀusion is dominated by the ﬁnite escape rate.
Diﬀusion for DF > 2 is normal for large times, enhanced though for small and intermediate times.
In
particular, it follows that fractals generated by a particular class of self-organized criticality (SOC) models
give rise to enhanced diﬀusion. The analytical results are illustrated by Monte-Carlo simulations.

INTRODUCTION

We study the problem of particles performing a ran-
dom walk through a fractal environment in 3-dimensional
embedding space. The particles travel freely in the space
not occupied by the fractal and are scattered oﬀ into
random directions when they hit the fractal. We derive
analytically the distribution pr of the random walk incre-
ments as a function of the dimension DF of the fractal
set, and we calculate the diﬀusivity analytically, using
the formalism of continuous time random walk (CTRW;
e.g. [1]), which we generalize here in order to include the
case of defective (not normalized to one) distributions of
walk-increments. The random walk is ﬁnally illustrated
by Monte Carlo simulations.

The physical applications for the theory developed
here are to systems consisting of a large number of
spatially distributed, localized scatterers (accelerators),
whose support forms a fractal set, suspended in a per-
meable medium, and in which particles move, with their
dynamics being governed by collisions with the fractal:
The particles move freely in the system except when they
hit a part of the fractal (a scatterer), where they undergo
the respective interaction, after which they leave the scat-
tering center, possibly hit the fractal again, and so forth,
performing thus a random walk in between subsequent
interactions.

One application of the introduced theory is to particle

transport in turbulent plasmas, whenever it can be as-
serted that the ﬁeld inhomogeneities are distributed in a
fractal way. This is implicitly claimed there where tur-
bulent plasmas have successfully been modeled with self-
organized criticality (SOC; about SOC see [2]): In Ref.
[3], it has recently been shown that the unstable sites
at temporal snap-shots during an avalanche in 3D form a
fractal with dimension roughly 1.8. This can be expected
to hold for all SOC models whose evolution rules are of
the type of [5]. Particles moving in the model will thus
undergo the type of diﬀusion we analyze here.

Concrete examples of applications include the follow-
ing: (i) Solar ﬂares have been shown to be compatible
with SOC ([4, 5]). The unstable sites of the SOC model,
which represent small-scale current-dissipation regions
(see [4]), cause the acceleration of particles, which per-
form thus a random walk of the type we analyze here. (ii)
Though the question is still under debate, there are in-
dications that the Earth’s magnetosphere exhibits struc-
tures compatible with SOC (e.g. [6]). (iii) In inquiries
on conﬁned plasmas and the related transport phenom-
ena, evidence has been collected that the conﬁned plasma
might be in the state of SOC (claimed in [9], doubted
though in [10]). Moreover, it is known that particles in
conﬁned plasmas undergo anomalous diﬀusion ([11]), a
property which we will show also to hold often for the
particles in the kind of systems we analyze here. (iv) A
non-plasma, non-SOC example, where the theory devel-
oped here potentially can be applied, is the random walk
of cosmic particles, which are scattered oﬀ the fractally
distributed galaxies (e.g. [12]).

The investigation we present here is to be contrasted
to two related, though characteristically diﬀerent kinds

of studies: — (I) In Ref. [13], random walks and diﬀu-
sion along fractals are investigated, where the particles
are forced to move along a fractal structure. The fractals
investigated are connected fractals or percolation back-
bones. These studies are motivated by applications to the
transport in porous media, or along percolation networks,
and it is established that the diﬀusion in these systems
is often anomalous. Diﬀerently to these studies, our ran-
dom walkers cross the permeable space freely, they are
not forced to follow the fractal structure, but they just
occasionally hit the fractal. — (II) In Ref. ([14]), the
random walk of sand grains in sand-pile (SOC) models
is investigated, i.e. the direct transport of the unstable
sites, which are found to undergo anomalous, enhanced
diﬀusion.
In contrast to these studies, when applying
our theory to SOC models, we do not study the diﬀu-
sion of the unstable sites (the transport of sand grains),
but the diﬀusion of additional particles, foreign to the
system (they are not contained in pure sand-pile mod-
els), which interact with the unstable sites, i.e. we freeze
time in the avalanche model and let particles interact
with the spatially distributed unstable sites. This is mo-
tivated through applications where the sand-pile does not
model the evolution of real sand or rice-piles, but where it
models ultimately the evolution of some kind of forces in
dilute media (e.g. some kind of stress forces, or the mag-
netic or electric ﬁeld in plasmas), in which the avalanche
model merely gives the locations of the instabilities which
aﬀect particles moving otherwise freely in the system.

The fractal sets which constitute the environment we
analyze are natural fractals, which exhibit self-similar
scaling behavior only in a ﬁnite range, and which are
made up of ﬁnite, 3-dimensional elementary volumes,
small in size compared to the size of the fractal. Ac-
cording to Ref. [16], such environments could be termed
3-dimensional, fractal Lorentz gas. Actually, any frac-
tal set encountered in nature is a natural fractal in the
sense introduced here, from the classical examples (the
coast-line of Britain, cloud-surfaces, etc.; see [15]), to the
localized scattering centers of the above mentioned ap-
plications mainly to plasma physics, which are yet small
regions, with ﬁnite volumes, though.

In Sec. II, we will specify the notion of natural frac-
tals, introduce the way we model the fractal scaling be-
haviour of natural fractals, derive analytically the prob-
ability distribution of the random walk increments for
random walks through fractal environments, give the re-
lations for the rate of unaﬀected escape from the system,
and derive approximate forms of the distribution of jump
increments. In Sec. III, the theory of Continuous Time
Random Walk (CTRW) will be introduced and gener-
alized to include the case of defective (not normalized
to one) distributions of jump increments. The CTRW
formalism will then be applied to determine analytically
the diﬀusive behaviour for random walks through fractal
environments, and to calculate the expected number of
collisions with the fractal (in Sec. IV for fractal dimen-
sions DF < 2, and in Sec. V for DF > 2). In Sec. VI,

Sec. VIII.

II. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE
INCREMENTS OF A RANDOM WALK
THROUGH A FRACTAL ENVIRONMENT

A. Speciﬁcation of the problem; natural
fractals

We assume a fractal F embedded in 3-dimensional
space ( IR3) with a fractal dimension DF (e.g. box-
counting or correlation dimension). We furthermore as-
sume that there are particles (the random walkers) which
travel freely in the empty (in the sense of not aﬀecting
the random walkers) space, but are scattered into ran-
dom directions oﬀ the points belonging to the fractal F .
Fig. 1 sketches the situation. Our interest in this Section
is in the statistical distribution of the particles’ traveled
distances in between two consecutive collisions with the
fractal, i.e. of the random walk increments.

If we pose the problem in this form, then the fractals
fall into two distinct classes: Imagine a particle to be
situated at a point ~xi belonging to F , somewhere in the
interior. The particle actually ’sees’ the projection of the
fractal onto a large imaginary sphere S around F and
centered at ~xi, exactly as we do see the stars projected
onto the celestial sphere. This sphere is 2-dimensional,
so that, if DF < 2, the projection FP of F onto S has
dimension DP = DF < 2 (see e.g. [20]). This implies
that FP has zero measure (no volume). The possible tra-
jectories for the particle are the straight lines originating
from ~xi. The probability of such a trajectory to hit the
fractal F at all is the area occupied by FP on S, divided
by the area of S; thus, the probability to hit the fractal is
zero, the particle will almost never hit the fractal, it will
almost surely escape from the system, and it does not

make sense to determine a distribution of random walk
increments.

On the other hand, if DF ≥ 2, then the projection of
F onto S has dimension DP = 2, and the area occupied
by FP on S is positive (see e.g. [20]). The probability of
the particle to hit the fractal, which is again the area of
FP on S, divided by the area of S, is ﬁnite, and it makes
sense to determine a distribution of walk increments (for
an isotropic fractal, we expect the probability to hit the
fractal to be 1, but there may be a ﬁnite probability for a
particle to escape unaﬀected, without hitting the fractal
at all, depending on the degree of spatial anisotropy of
the concrete fractal under consideration).

This distinction holds for mathematical fractals, which
per deﬁnition exhibit a scale-free scaling behavior (self-
similarity or — possibly statistical — self-aﬃnity) from
their usually ﬁnite size down to all scales. Our interest
here is though in what we term natural fractals: They
are characterized by the following properties: (i) They
(ii)
are sampled only with a ﬁnite number of points.
Their scaling behavior exhibits a lower cut-oﬀ, i.e. irre-
spective of the numerical method used to determine their
fractal dimension, there will be a lower limit of scaling
for the estimator. Correspondingly, there is a ﬁnite min-
imum separation distance δ between the points of the
fractal. This property is partly a consequence of prop-
erty (i). (iii) The elements the natural fractals consists of
are not mathematical points, line-segments, or surface el-
ements, but they represent ﬁnite, yet small 3-dimensional
elementary volumes δV , at most of radial size δ/2.

Properties (i) and (ii) characterize what one might call
a ﬁnite fractal. They imply that F = {xi}i=1,...,nF , i.e.
F is a ﬁnite collection of nF isolated points, with δ the
smallest distance between them.
If we assume the set
F to be contained in a sphere with radius l, then F ex-
hibits a fractal scaling behaviour for scales r in the range
δ ≤ r ≤ l. The property (iii) makes the fractal natural in
the sense that the points xi of F represent actually small
3-dimensional volumes δV of radial sizes smaller than
δ/2, with which a particle can interact through some
forces, depending on the concrete physical application.
We assume correspondingly an interaction cross-section
ρ2π with cross-sectional radius ρ to be associated with
every point belonging to the fractal.

Since the δV are 3-dimensional objects, we must re-
quire that that the volumes δV should be smaller in ra-
dial size (ρ) than δ/2, i.e. ρ ≤ δ/2: If ρ were larger than
δ/2, then the fractal scaling of the natural fractal would
break down already at the scale 2ρ, the diameter of the
elementary volumes δV , i.e. before reaching the scale δ,
which means that δ would have been inadequately deter-
mined and would have to be adjusted. Moreover, if the
radius ρ of the volumes δV were in the range δ/2 ≤ ρ ≤ δ,
then near elementary volumes would over-lap, and they
would be taken for one elementary volume.

In the frame of natural fractals, the random walk prob-
lem we pose takes a diﬀerent shape:
if the fractal were
just ﬁnite, then all the particles would almost surely es-

3

cape from the system without colliding with the fractal,
since the probability to hit a ﬁnite set of isolated points
with a straight line trajectory is obviously zero (the ﬁnite
fractal in any case is a set of measure (volume) zero).
Yet, since the fractals we analyze are natural, the iso-
lated points of the fractal represent ﬁnite 3-dimensional
volumes with a corresponding ﬁnte cross section, so that
there is a ﬁnite probability for a particle to collide with
these elementary volumes, and it makes sense to deter-
mine the corresponding distribution of walk increments.
A clariﬁcation is to be made concerning the scattering
process: The scattering of the particles oﬀ the points of
the fractal (the elementary volumes) is not scattering oﬀ
hard spheres. We consider the elementary volumes as re-
gions into which particles can penetrate, they will though
be aﬀected by some forces inside these regions. This is
realistic since our main application is to plasma-physics,
where the elementary volumes are typically regions where
an electric ﬁeld resides.

Last, we note that the radial size l of the entire fractal
is of course ﬁnite in any reasonable physical application.
The derivations we will give in the following are conse-
quently made for the case of ﬁnite fractals (l < ∞), it will
though turn out that l appears just as an arbitrary exte-
rior parameter and therewith is allowed to take arbitrar-
ily large values (Secs. II C 1 and II C 2). It will further-
more turn out that several characteristics of the problem
we analyze assume ﬁnite asymptotic values if l becomes
very large (Secs. II D and II E). We will thus include in
our treatment the case of what we term asymptotically
large systems, by which we mean systems where l is so
large that the asymptotic, large l behaviour is practically
reached, and we may let l → ∞ in the respective rela-
tions. In Sec. II D, the notion of ’asymptotically large’
fractals will be given a more precise meaning. Systems
smaller than asymptotically large will be termed ﬁnite
systems. Asymptotically large systems are of interest in
applications above all to astrophysical plasma-systems,
where fractals may indeed be very large.

B. The fractal scaling behaviour

Let us choose an arbitrary reference point ~xi of the
fractal, somewhere in the interior (to neglect boundary
eﬀects). Let ni(r) denote the number of points belonging
to the fractal F in the 3-dimensional sphere around ~xi
with radius r (r ≤ l, with l the radial size of the fractal).
Since F is a fractal with dimension DF , it is expected
that

ni(r) = Ai rD(i)
F ,

(1)

with Ai a constant (Eq. (1) is based on the mass-scaling
deﬁnition of fractal dimension, which is a common, prac-
tical deﬁnition of fractal dimension, see e.g. [15]). Eq.
(1) holds actually in the limit r → 0, but in practice it
is known that the scaling behavior appears often already

clearly at ﬁnite r, and the limit r → 0 is not feasible. It
is also worthwhile noting that Eq. (1) deﬁnes the local
fractal dimension D(i)
F , which may ﬂuctuate with diﬀer-
ent reference points ~xi, the more, the less numerous the
points of the fractal are. The average of Eq. (1) over the
whole fractal F is yet well deﬁned (else F would in prac-
tice not be called a fractal). In our applications, we are
interested in statistical results, averaged over the entire
fractal, i.e. over all possible reference points ~xi, so that
in the following we use a single scaling behaviour

n(r) = ArDF

(2)

everywhere, which corresponds to the average of the local
ni(r) [Eq. (1)] over i. The constant A is determined as
follows: With every point ~xi of the fractal is associated
a scale δi — the distance to the nearest neighbour —,
at which the local scaling behaviour ni(r) breaks down
(ni(δi) = 1, so that ni(r) = (r/δi)D(i)
F ), which determines
the constant Ai in Eq. (1), Ai = (1/δi)D(i)
F . The scale δ
introduced in Sec. II A, where the scaling breaks totally
down, is understood as the minimum of all the δi, δ :=
mini[δi]. For the average n(r) of Eq. (2), we have to use
an average scale δ∗ at which the scaling breaks down on
the average (i.e. n(δ∗) = 1). In the examples of fractals
we will introduce below, we ﬁnd the distributions of the
δi to be very asymmetric: they show a clear peak, but
exhibit a tail which extends to large δi. Fig. 2 shows
a typical example of a histogram of the δi for the set
F3 which will be introduced below in Sec. VI A 1. This
particlular shape of the distribution of the δi has as a
consequence that the arithmetic mean value of the δi is
not representative of an average scale, it overestimates it.
We therefore deﬁne δ∗ as the most probable value of the
distribution of the δi, determining it by a histogram of
the δi. The fractal scaling behaviour thus takes the form

with δ ≤ r ≤ l.

Since the radial size of the the fractal is l, it follows
that n(l) is the total number of points nF of the fractal,
or, with Eq. (3),

n(r) =

This relation is actually analogous to the case of non-
fractal sets: If we sample for instance a 3–dimensional
cube of side-length l with a resolution δ∗, then we would
obviously ﬁnd (l/δ∗)3 points. Eq. (4) holds of course only
for points in the interior of the fractal, towards the edge
it is biased by edge eﬀects.

and Table I).

C. Analytical derivation of the probability
distribution pr of the random walk increments

From Eq. (3),

it follows that the number of points
m(r)∆r of the fractal in a spherical shell around an inte-
rior point ~xi with inner radius r and radial thickness ∆r
is m(r)∆r = d

dr n(r) · ∆r, or

DF −1

∆r.

m(r)∆r =

r
δ∗ (cid:19)

DF
δ∗ (cid:18)
With every point of the natural fractal is associated a
cross-section ρ2π, within which an approaching particle
gets into contact (interacts) with a point (elementary vol-
ume) of the fractal (see Sec. II A). The entire shell has
thus a total cross-section s(r)∆r = m(r)∆r · ρ2π, i.e.

(5)

DF −1

(6)

∆r.

r
δ∗ (cid:19)

s(r)∆r = ρ2π

DF
δ∗ (cid:18)
In order this to hold, the diﬀerent points of the fractal
should not overlap or cover each other with their cross
sections.
In the direction perpendicular to the radius
r this is guaranteed by the fact that ρ ≤ δ/2, half the
smallest separation distance of the points of the fractal,
with ρ the cross-sectional radius. In the radial direction,
it is also guaranteed, as long as we let ∆r ≤ δ/2, so that
also in radial direction we can be sure that no point is
hidden by the cross-sectional surface of another point in
front of it.

Assume now that a particle has started from ~xi and
has traveled freely a distance r into a random direction.
The probability qr ∆r to hit the fractal in the spherical
shell between r and r + ∆r is the ratio of the total cross-
section of the shell (the occupied area), divided by the
area of the shell, qr ∆r = s(r)∆r/4πr2, or, with some

rearrangements,

qr ∆r =

(7)

Our scope is to derive the probability pr∆r for a par-
ticle to travel freely a distance r and then to hit the frac-
tal in the spherical shell between r and r + ∆r, starting
from an arbitrary point of F . To derive this probabil-
ity, we divide the interval [δ, r], which the particle travels
freely, into a large number of small intervals of size δr:
[r1, r2], [r2, r3], ..., [rn−1, rn], with r1 = δ, rn = r, and
ri+1 − ri = δr for all i (the interval [0, δ] is free of points
of F , and thus has not to be taken into account, since
there are no points of the fractal closer than δ). The
probability not to hit the fractal in the intervals [ri, ri+1]
is 1 − qri δr, so that the probability not to hit the fractal
in all the small intervals up to r, and to hit it ﬁnally in
the interval [r, r + ∆r] is

pr∆r = (1 − qr1 δr) · (1 − qr2δr) · ...

The probability pr∆r = πr qr ∆r (Eq. 11) for a particle to

Notably, the radial size l of the fractal does not appear
in the relation for pr: l determines only the upper cut-oﬀ
of pr, it does not inﬂuence its shape. The size l is thus an
exterior parameter of the problem we study and can take
any value between δ and inﬁnity, without leading to any

since δ ≤ r ≤ l, and since the exponent is negative (DF −

n → ∞, since this implies that δr → 0 (δr is something
like (r−δ)/n, or, independent of r, (l−δ)/n), and we may

D. The rate for unaﬀected escape

πr as deﬁned in Eq. (10) is the probability not to hit
the fractal at all in [δ, r] [see the explanation before Eq.
(8)], so that πr|r=l is obviously the probability νesc not
to hit the fractal at all, but to move unaﬀected by the
fractal to the edge of the system and to ﬁnally escape.

Eqs. (20) and (21) imply that, depending mainly on
the values of DF , l, δ, δ∗, and ρ, there possibly is a ﬁ-
nite rate for unaﬀected escape, i.e. a ﬁnite fraction of the
particles does not ’see’ the fractal and moves through the
system without collisions until it ﬁnally leaves. Actually,
for ﬁnite systems (l < ∞), there is in any case a ﬁnite
rate of unaﬀected escape, which is the larger, the smaller
the system size (l), the cross-sectional radius ρ, and the
fractal dimension DF are. For very large systems though,
νesc settles to an asymptotic value, which corresponds to
the lowest possible escape rate for given ρ and DF . As
explained in Sec. II A, we will in the following call sys-
tems asymptotically large (in contrast to ﬁnite systems),
if they are so large that νesc has practically settled to
its asymptotic value, and we will determine νesc in their
case by letting l → ∞.

For asymptotically large systems (l → ∞), we have the

following cases, depending on the value of DF :

• In the case DF > 2, we ﬁnd from Eq. (20)

νesc(DF > 2, l → ∞) = 0,

(22)

so that all particles will collide with the asymptot-
ically large fractal.

• In the case DF = 2, Eq. (21) yields

νesc(DF = 2, l → ∞) = 0,

(23)

and again all particles collide with the asymptoti-
cally large fractal.

which is strictly smaller than 1 (note that the ar-
gument of the exponential function is in any case
negative and ﬁnite), so that there is a ﬁnite frac-
tion νesc of particles which move through the sys-
tem without having any encounter along their path
with the asymptotically large fractal, until they es-
cape.

In Fig. 3, the rate of unaﬀected escape νesc is plotted
against DF for DF < 2, assuming asymptotically large
systems (l → ∞): the escape rate is high, and only when
DF approaches quite close 2, the escape rate drops to
low values.

FIG. 3: The escape rate νesc vs. the fractal dimension
DF , for 0 < DF < 2 and assuming asymptotically large
systems (l → ∞; see Sec. II D).

It is to note that the particles which escape unaﬀected
do not leave the system instantaneously, they remain in
the system and move on a straight line path with their in-
dividual ﬁnite velocity, without ever colliding again with
the fractal, until they reach the edge of the system and
leave. In other words, the paths the escaping particles
follow never and nowhere intersect the fractal.
In the
case of asymptotically large fractals, the time elapsing
until an escaping particle reaches the edge of the system
may of course be considerable and much larger than the
time for which the particles are tracked.

In Appendix A, Eqs. (20) and (21) will be derived in
an alternative way, and it will be shown that the possibly
ﬁnite rate of unaﬀected escape is related to the fact that

pr is not necessarily normalized to one, it actually holds
that

where

νesc = 1 − µ,

µ :=

is the normalization of pr. The cases of ﬁnite escape
rate (for asymptotically large (l → ∞) as well for ﬁnite
system size) correspond thus to the cases where µ < 1,
i.e. to the cases where pr is defective.

E. Approximate forms of pr

To determine possible approximate or asymptotic
forms of pr, we consider the logarithmic derivative of pr

The term DF − 3 stems from the power-law factor, and

reaches DF − 3 for large r, being slightly distorted for
small r, at most by the amount (DF ρ2/4δ2

It follows that for DF < 2 the second moments
r2pr dr) are inﬁnite (the moments are dominated by
(
the asymptotic, large r regime), so that the random walks
R
in the cases DF < 2 are approximate realizations of Levy-
ﬂights: for large r, the p(a; DF <2)
are of the same form
as the Levy distributions, namely power-laws with in-
dex between −3 and −1 (see e.g. [22]), and it is actually
the large r regime which causes the second moments to
diverge and the random walk statistics not to obey the
Central Limit Theorem. A characteristic diﬀerence to
the Levy distributions is though that the distributions
p(a; DF <2)
are in any case defective, associated with a
r
ﬁnite escape rate (Sec. II D).

For DF > 2, the logarithmic slope in Eq. (27) is dom-
inated by the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s., which increases

7

in magnitude with increasing r, so that pr is decaying
exponentially for large r, which implies that the second
moments are ﬁnite, and the corresponding random walks
are governed by the Central Limit Theorem.

The case DF = 2 is a pure power-law without any ap-
proximation (Eq. 19), the second moment is obviously
inﬁnite, and the random walk is an approximate realiza-
tion of a Levy-ﬂight, as are the cases DF < 2, defective
though in the case of ﬁnite systems (see Sec. II D).

III. CONTINUOUS TIME RANDOM WALK,
GENERALIZED TO THE CASE OF
DEFECTIVE DISTRIBUTIONS: THEORY

In order to determine the diﬀusive behavior of parti-
cles analytically, we follow the formalism of Continuous
Time Random Walk (CTRW; see [1]) in the version of
the velocity model (see [7, 17]). In this approach, it is
assumed that each spatial walk increment ~r is performed
in ﬁnite time τ , where r(≡ |~r|) and τ are related through
the velocity v of the walker, which we assume to be arbi-
trary and constant. If we would not take into account the
time spent in the jumps, then the mean square displace-
ment we calculate below would be inﬁnite in the cases
where DF < 2, since the second moments of pr are in-
ﬁnite (Sec. II E), so that actually only the formalism of
CTRW makes sense.

The connection between travel time τ spent in a jump
and spatial increment ~r is expressed by the joint prob-
ability density ψ(~r, τ ) to perform an unhindered walk-
increment ~r in time τ , which, in its simplest form, is

ψ(~r, τ ) = p(~r)δ(τ − |~r|/v),

(29)

(cid:19)






(28)

where the δ-function just expresses the fact that a walk
increment ~r takes time τ = |~r|/v to be performed (δ(τ −
|~r|/v) is actually the conditional probability for the time
spent in jump to equal τ , given that the jump length is
|~r|). The spatial part p(~r) of Eq. (29) is the probability
to make a jump ~r, and it is is given through pr [Eq. (16),
(19) or (28)] as

p(~r) ≡ p(|~r|) =

(30)

pr
4πr2 .

(Note that pr is the probability to jump a distance r
into any direction, it is thus the marginal probability
distribution of p(~r), integrated over all directions, pr =
p(~r) dσ, with dσ = r2 sin θ dr dθ dφ the usual surface
element in spherical coordinates, so that pr = 4πr2p(|~r|)
R
in the case where p(~r) is isotropic.)

The formalism to determine the diﬀusive behaviour in
the frame of CTRW for given jump- and ﬂight-time dis-
tributions is presented e.g. in [7, 17]. We have though to
generalize this formalism in order to make it possible to
treat the case of possibly defective jump distributions.

A. The propagator

The basic quantity to be derived in order to determine
the diﬀusive behaviour is the so-called propagator P (~r, t),
the probability density for a particle to be at position
~r at time t. Thereto, we ﬁrst have to determine the
probability distribution Q(~r, t) of the turning points (the
points where the random walker changes direction), for
which holds

t

d3r′
Z0

Z

Q(~r, t) =

dτ Q(~r − ~r′, t − τ ) ψ(~r′, τ ) + δ(t)δ(~r).

(31)
This equation states that the probability to be at a turn-
ing point ~r at time t equals the probability to be at the
turning point ~r − ~r′ at time t − τ , and to jump ~r′ dur-
ing time τ , namely onto the turning point ~r exactly at
time t. The second term on the r.h.s. explicitly takes
the initial condition into account, assuming that all the
random walkers start at the point ~r = 0 at time t = 0.
In between turning points, the random walker is moving
with constant velocity v on a straight line segment. The
probability P (~r, t) to be at ~r at time t is determined as

P (~r, t) =

dτ Q(~r − ~r′, t − τ ) Φ(~r′, τ ),

(32)

t

d3r′

where Φ(~r, τ ) is the probability to travel a distance ~r
in time τ , while making a jump of any length between
r ≡ |~r| and ∞, i.e. while either being on the way to the
next turning point, or while moving unaﬀected on a path
leading to escape,

Φ(~r, τ ) =: Φ(c)(~r, τ ) + Φ(e)(~r, τ )

with pr from Eq. (16), (19) or (28), and where on
the r.h.s. we identify the ﬁrst term as the ’collisional’
term Φ(c)(~r, τ ) and the second term as the ’escape’ term
Φ(e)(~r, τ ). The appearance of the ’escape’ term is a
consequence of the possible defectiveness of pr, if pr is
normalized to one (µ = 1) then this term disappears
(νesc = 1−µ = 0, see Sec. II D). It takes into account the
particles which have started from a turning point and are
moving unaﬀected until they escape, not colliding any-
more with the fractal on their path. Eq. (33) holds in the
range δ ≤ r ≤ ∞. In the range 0 ≤ r ≤ δ, all the par-
ticles move unhindered, either they are on a unaﬀected
escape path or they are on the way to their next turning
point, since there are no points of the fractal closer than
δ (see Sec. II A), so that for r ≤ δ

Φ(~r, τ ) =: Φ(0)(~r, τ ) = δ(τ − |~r|/v) ·

With the description of Φ(~r, τ ), it is now clear that Eq.
(32) expresses the fact that a particle is (i) either at a
turning point (~r′ = 0, τ = 0), or (ii) has started from
a turning point (at ~r − ~r′, t − τ ) and is now traveling
towards its next turning point, not yet having reached it,
though, (τ > 0, ~r′ 6= 0) and passes by the the point ~r
at time t, or (iii) the particle has started from a turning
point (at ~r −~r′, t − τ ) and moves unaﬀected on an escape
path (τ > 0, ~r′ 6= 0), passing by the the point ~r at time
t.

Eq. (32) is an integral equation for P (~r, t), with ψ(r, τ )
given, together with the auxiliary integral equation for
Q(~r, t) (Eq. 31). As pointed out in Sec. II A, in every
reasonable application the system is ﬁnite, i.e. the frac-
tal is of ﬁnite size (l < ∞), and the particles deﬁnitely
leave the region occupied by the fractal when they have
reached a distance from the origin equal to the radial size
of the fractal. This implies that the spatial integrals in
Eqs. (31) and (32) are actually over a ﬁnite range (equal
to the linear size of the fractal), and somewhat involved
methods have to be used to solve the integral equations
(see e.g. [7] for a study of these combined integral equa-
tions for a ﬁnite system in 1-dimensional space and in
the non-defective case). Here, we simplify the problem
by assuming that the fractal is very large, so that as-
suming an inﬁnite system size l should give a good im-
pression of the diﬀusive behavior. The ﬁnite system size
acts merely as an upper cut-oﬀ for the possible range
of values of the distances from the origin that particles
travel. Since we again let l → ∞, as in Sec. II, we can
formally identify the very large systems we have in mind
here with the asymptotically large systems introduced in
Sec. II. For asymptotically large systems now (l → ∞),
the combined integral equations (32) and (31) are most
easily solved by Fourier-transforming in space (~r → ~k)
and Laplace-transforming in time (t → s), applying the
respective Laplace and Fourier convolution-theorems (see
e.g. [23]), which yields

P (~k, s) =

Φ(~k, s)
1 − ψ(~k, s)

(35)

Eq. (35) is formally identical to the non-defective case
(see [17]), it is to note though that Φ is deﬁned in a
diﬀerent, generalized way.

B. The diﬀusive behaviour

The mean square displacement

h~r2(t)i :=

~r2P (~r, t) d3r

(36)

can straight forwardly be shown to equal to

h~r2(t)i = −

(37)

Z

d~k2

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(by inserting the deﬁnition of Fourier transform). To cal-
culate h~r2(t)i through Eqs. (35) and (37) analytically in
the Secs. IV and V, we will make the following assump-
tions: (i) s << 1 (since we are interested in the case
of t → ∞), (ii) |~k| << 1 (corresponding to asymptoti-
cally large systems, l → ∞), and (iii) |~k| << s (since,
according to Eq. (37), we will at the end set ~k = 0).

C. The expected number of jumps in a given
time-interval

Since the escape rate can be ﬁnite, it will be interesting
to know how many times a particle collides on the average
with the fractal before it escapes. We determine thus in
this section a relation for the expected number of jumps
hN (t)i in a given time interval [0, t]. This relation is
in principle given e.g. in [22], we have though to clarify
whether the relation in [22] is applicable to the cases of
defective jump distributions.

We determine ﬁrst the distribution of travel times ϕ(t),
i.e. the distribution of the times spent in a single jump,
as the marginal distribution of ψ(~r, t) (Eq. 29)

ϕ(τ ) :=

ψ(~r, τ ) d3r.

(38)

Z
Concerning the normalization of ϕ(τ ), we note that

∞

δ/v

Z

∞

δ
Z

ϕ(τ ) dτ =

pr dr = µ

(39)

(see App. B 3), the normalization of ϕ(τ ) is thus identical
to the normalization of pr, which we deﬁned to be µ in
Eq. (26). The distribution of travel times ϕ(τ ) is thus
defective (µ < 1) in the cases where the distribution of
jump increments pr is defective.

The probability ϕn(t) for the nth jump to take place

at time t is recursively determined by

ϕn(t) =

ϕ(τ )ϕn−1(t − τ ) dτ,

(40)

t

Z0

i.e. if the (n − 1)th jump took place at time t − τ and was
followed by a jump of duration τ , then the nth jump takes
place at time t. Laplace-transforming yields ϕn(s) =
ϕ(s)ϕn−1(s) (through the Laplace convolution theorem),
and if we iterate, we are led to

ϕn(s) = ϕ(s)n.

(41)

The probability prob[N (t) = n] that the number of
jumps N (t) made in the time interval [0, t] equals a given
number n is given as

prob[N (t) = n] =

ϕn(t′)Ξ(t − t′) dt′,

(42)

with Ξ(t − t′) the probability to make a jump of duration
at least t−t′. Eq. (42) states that the nth jump took place
at time t′, and the subsequent jump took longer than
t − t′, so that there was no subsequent jump completed
in [t′, t]. Ξ(t) is determined as

Ξ(t) =

ϕ(¯t) d¯t + νesc,

(43)

∞

Zt

where the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. is the probability that
a particle makes a jump of duration t or longer, and the
second term is the probability that a particle moves unaf-
fected on a path leading to escape, having thus an inﬁnite
∞
travel time. Using µ =
o ϕ(t) dt [see Eq. (39)], we can
write Eq. (43) as
R

Ξ(t) = µ −

ϕ(¯t) d¯t + νesc

= 1 −

ϕ(¯t) d¯t,

(44)

where we have used the fact that µ + νesc = 1 [Eq. (25)].
The Laplace transform of Eq. (44) is

Ξ(s) =

(1 − ϕ(s)),

(45)

and Laplace-transforming Eq. (42) yields

prob[N (s) = n] = ϕn(s)Ξ(s)
= ϕ(s)nΞ(s),

(46)

where we have inserted also Eq. (41), and on replacing
Ξ(s) by Eq. (45), we ﬁnd

prob[N (s) = n] = ϕ(s)n 1
s

(1 − ϕ(s)).

(47)

The expected number of jumps hN (t)i in the time-
interval [0, t] follows from the deﬁnition of expectation
value,

hN (t)i =

n · prob[N (t) = n],

(48)

which in Laplace space becomes, when also inserting Eq.
(47),

hN (s)i =

n · prob[N (s) = n]

=

(1 − ϕ(s))

n · ϕ(s)n.

It thus turned out that the expression for hN (s)i in
the defective case is identical to the relation for the case
where ϕ(t) is normalized to one (see e.g. [22]). The essen-
tial modiﬁcation in the derivation for the defective case
was the addition of the term νesc in Eq. (43).

Contrary to the relations which determine h~r2(t)i
[mainly Eq. (35)], the formula for hN (s)i [Eq. (50)] is
valid also in the case of ﬁnite systems (l < ∞): The
Laplace convolution-theorem we used to solve the inte-
gral equations (40) and (42) is applicable to convolutions
over ﬁnite intervals, contrary to the Fourier convolution-
theorem used in Sec. III A, which demands inﬁnite inte-
gration intervals in order to be applicable; see e.g. [23].

Φ(~r, τ ) [Eqs. (33) and (34)] consists of three parts:

walk is of the type of defective Levy-ﬂights. We will use

By assuming that the system is asymptotically large

the Fourier- Laplace-transforms of ψ(~r, t) [Eq. (52)] and
Φ(~r, t) [Eqs. (33) and (34)]. The way we calculate the
Fourier- and Laplace-transforms, also in the subsequent

Sec. III B) is described in App. B:

Φ(c)(~k, s) + Φ(e)(~k, s) + Φ(0)(~k, s) [Eqs. (56), (57), (58)
and (59)] into Eq. (35), diﬀerentiating P (~k, s) according
to Eq. (37), setting thereafter ~k zero, we ﬁnd, neglect-
ing the constants, keeping only the leading terms in s for
s → 0, and noting that µ 6= 1,

for 0 < DF < 2.

The DF -dependence (through ψ(~k, s) and Φ(~k, s)) has
disappeared in the limit s → 0, the behaviour is ac-
tually dominated by the DF -independent escape term
Φ(e)(~k, s).

Since Eq. (60) holds only for s → 0, the direct Laplace
back-transformation is not deﬁned, and we have to use
the Tauberian theorems (see e.g. [19]), which yield for t
large

< ~r2(t) >∼ t2,

for 0 < DF < 2.

(61)

The diﬀusion is thus in any case anomalous, namely en-
hanced, of the super-diﬀusive, ballistic type.

B. DF < 2: the expected number of collisions

Since the escape rate νesc is in any case ﬁnite for DF <
2 (Sec. II D), it is of interest to know how many times a
particle collides on the average with the fractal before it
escapes. Thereto, we determine the expected number of
jumps hN (t)i performed by a particle in the time interval
[0, t]. According to Sec. III C, we ﬁrst have to determine
ϕ(τ ), which through Eqs. (38) and Eq. (52) we ﬁnd to be

ϕ(τ ) = CvDF −2τ DF −3

(62)

for τ ≥ δ/v (the minimum jump length is δ, see Sec.
II A).

For DF < 1, the Laplace transform of ϕ(t) is (see App.

B 5)

ϕ(s) ≈ µ − hT i s,

(63)

with µ the normalization of ϕ(τ ) (see Eq. 39), and where
hT i is the expectation value of the the time spent in a
jump,

hT i =

τ ϕ(τ ) dτ.

(64)

For DF > 1, the Laplace transform of ϕ(t) becomes

ϕ(s) ≈ µ − CvDF −2 Γ(DF − 1) s2−DF ,

(65)

the second term diverges for s → 0, implying that the
expected ﬂight time hT i is inﬁnite (see App. B).

Inserting into Eq. (50), we ﬁnd, when keeping only the

leading terms in s and noting that µ 6= 1,

hN (s)i ∼

,

for 0 < DF < 2,

(66)

— as in the case of h~r2(s)i [Eq. (60)], hN (s)i is indepen-
dent of DF , due to the fact that the normalization µ < 1,
i.e. the ﬁnite rate of unaﬀected escape νesc [= 1 − µ, see
Eq. (25)] dominates the behaviour. From Eq. (66), the
Tauberian theorems yield for the back-transform

hN (t)i ∼

δ(t),

for 0 < DF < 2.

The expected number of jumps is therewith constant, it
does not increase with time anymore for large enough
times. In Fig. 4, we show hN (t)i as a function of the di-
mension DF (DF < 2) for asymptotically large systems
(l → ∞) and large times such that hN (t)i has settled
to its expected value. Obviously, particles do very ineﬃ-
ciently interact with fractals of dimension below 2, they
almost do not see the fractals, and only if the dimen-
sion approaches quite close the value 2, collisions with
the fractal become numerous and important. For ﬁnite
systems, the escape rate νesc is still larger (see Sec. II D),
and collisions with the fractal get even more rare.

IV B).

V. APPLICATION OF THE CTRW
FORMALISM TO THE CASE DF > 2

A. Diﬀusion for DF > 2

For DF > 2, pr cannot be approximated by a power-
law (see Sec. II E), we have to keep the full form of pr in
Eq. (16), and the random walk is governed by the Cen-
tral Limit Theorem, since all the moments of pr are ﬁnite.
We thus expect diﬀusion to be normal, a theoretical ex-
pectation we have to conﬁrm in the following.

We assume the system to be asymptotically large (l →
∞), so that we can apply the formalism of Secs. III A and
III B, and moreover it follows that νesc = 0 and µ = 1
(see Sec. II D). In order to determine h~r2(t)i through Eq.
(37), we have ﬁrst to determine the joint distribution for
walk increments and ﬂight times ψ(~r, t) [Eq. (29)], and
the distribution Φ(~r, t) to make a jump of at least length
r [Eqs. (33) and (34)]. For convenience, we write pr [Eq.
(16)] in the form

pr = C exp

−βrDF −2

rDF −3,

(68)

where all the constants in Eq. (16) are incorporated in
the constants C and β in an obvious manner. Eqs. (68),
(29), and (30) imply that

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

C
4π

ψ(~r, t) =

exp

−βrDF −2

rDF −5δ(t − r/v).

(69)

The Fourier-Laplace transform of ψ(~r, t) is found to be
(see App. B)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

ψ(~k, s) ≈ µ − hT i · s −

k2v2

hT 2i − hT 3i · s

,

(70)

where µ is the normalization of pr and, since we assume
the system to be asymptotically large (l → ∞), we have

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

µ = 1 (Sec. II D). The hT ni < ∞ are constants, whose
exact values are not relevant for our purposes, here (they
are actually the moments of the distribution ϕ(τ ) which
is introduced below in Sec. V B, see App. B).

The collisional part Φ(c)(~r, t) of Φ(~r, t) is given through

Eqs. (33) and (68),

Φ(c)(~r, t) =

exp

−βrDF −2

r−2

4πβ(D − 2)

(cid:2)

×δ(t − r/v).

(cid:3)

(71)

Fourier-Laplace-transforming Φ(c)(~k, s) yields (see App.
B)

Φ(c)(~k, s) ≈ b1 − s · b2 − k2(b3 − s · b4),

(72)

with the bi < ∞ constants.

The ’escape’ term Φ(e)(~r, t) of Φ(~r, t) [Eq. (33)] is zero

for asymptotically large systems (since νesc = 0).

Φ(0)(~r, t) [Eq. (34)] is independent of DF , so that its

Laplace-Fourier transform is given by Eq. (59).

Having determined ψ(~k, s) and Φ(~k, s) = Φ(c)(~k, s) +
Φ(0)(~k, s), we can turn to the determination of h~r2(s)i
through Eq. (37). For the asymptotically large systems
(l → ∞), which we consider here, it holds µ = 1, so that
the leading term in Eq. (37) for s → 0 is

h~r2(s)i ∼

1
s2 ,

h~r2(t)i ∼ t

and the Tauberian theorems yield the back-transform

for large times, i.e. diﬀusion is normal, as it is expected
from the Central Limit Theorem.

B. DF > 2: the expected number of collisions

According to Eq. (38) and Eq. (68), the distribution

ϕ(τ ) of times spent in a jump is

ϕ(τ ) = CvDF −2 exp

−βvDF −2τ DF −2

τ DF −3,

(75)

and for its Laplace-transform we ﬁnd (see App. B 5)

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

ϕ(s) ≈ µ − s hT i,

(76)

where µ is the normalization of ϕ(τ ) [see Eq. (39)], and
hT i the expected time spent in a single jump [deﬁned as
in Eq. (64)].

To determine hN (s)i through Eq. (50), we discern
between asymptotically large and ﬁnite systems: For
asymptotically large systems (l → ∞), we have νesc = 0
and µ = 1 (see Sec. II D), and, keeping only the leading
terms for s → 0, Eq. (50) yields

hN (s)i ∼

1
hτ i

1
s2 ,

(77)

12

(78)

so that by the Tauberian theorems the back-transform is

hN (t)i ∼

t
hτ i

— for large times, the number of jumps is just the time
divided by the expected time a walker spends in a sin-
gle jump. This is a consequence of the Central Limit
Theorem.

In the case of ﬁnite systems, the escape rate is ﬁnite,
νesc > 0, so that µ 6= 1 (Sec. II D), and the leading term
for s → 0 in Eq. (50) is

hN (s)i ∼

µ
1 − µ

1
s

.

(79)

By using the Tauberian theorems, we ﬁnd

hN (t)i ∼

δ(t),

(80)

µ
1 − µ

the expected number of collisions is constant for large
times, there is a ﬁnite, µ-dependent, average number of
collisions, after which a particle does not interact with
the fractal anymore and moves unaﬀected until it es-
capes.

Fig. 5 shows hN (t)i for ﬁnite systems [Eq. (80)] as a
function of l/δ, the scaling range of the fractal [µ in Eq.
(80) is an implicit function of l and δ, see Eq. (26)], for
diﬀerent dimensions DF . The number of collisions in-
creases of course with the scaling range of the fractal.
For fractals small in size, say l/δ = 100, collisions with
the fractals become important for dimensions DF above
roughly 2.3.

2.9 (long dash); see Sec. V B.

VI. MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS

To illustrate and verify the results of the previous sec-
tions, we perform a number of Monte Carlo simulations
of random walks through fractal environments.

A. Particle simulations: testing pr

In order to test the relations we found for pr, we gen-
erate a number of fractals of diﬀerent, prescribed dimen-
sions, and we determine numerically the distribution of
random walk increments.

1. Generation of test fractals

The fractals we use in our simulations are generalized,
3-dimensional versions of the ’middle (1 − 2a)th’ Can-
tor set (the middle part of length (1 − 2a) is omitted).
They are constructed with the method of iterated func-
tion schemes (see e.g. [20]), i.e. with the use of the fol-
lowing eight contractive maps in the 3-dimensional unit
cube [0, 1] × [0, 1] × [0, 1]

S1(~x) := a~x
S2(~x) := a~x + (1 − a, 0, 0)T
S3(~x) := a~x + (0, 1 − a, 0)T
S4(~x) := a~x + (0, 0, 1 − a)T
S5(~x) := a~x + (1 − a, 1 − a, 0)T
S6(~x) := a~x + (1 − a, 0, 1 − a)T
S7(~x) := a~x + (0, 1 − a, 1 − a)T
S8(~x) := a~x + (1 − a, 1 − a, 1 − a)T ,

(81)

where 0 < a < 0.5 is a free parameter. The set in-
variant under these contractions is a fractal (see e.g.
[20]). To generate the fractal sets in practice, a ran-
dom point ~xr in the unit cube is chosen and iterated
with the maps of Eq. (81), choosing at random one of
the eight contractions at a time: the n-th iterate ~x(n) is
~x(n) = Sin (Sin−1( ...... (Si2 (Si1 (~xr))) ..... )), with the in-
dices ij random integer numbers between 1 and 8. Af-
ter a transient phase of say 1000 iterations, the iter-
are indistinguishablely
ates
close to the underlying mathematical fractal, randomly
distributed across it. After their generation, the sets are
shifted to have their center at the origin, and they are
multiplied by a prescribed radial size l, so that they are
contained in a sphere of radius l around the origin.

~x(1001), ~x(1002), ~x(1003), ....

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

Since we want to model the case of natural fractals,
which show a lower cut-oﬀ of the scaling behaviour at
some scale δ (see Sec. II A), we must force the scaling be-
havior of the fractals we construct to break down at the
scale δ — in the way we construct the fractals, it would by
chance always be possible that two points ~x(1000+i) and
~x(1000+j) are closer too each other than δ. To achieve

13

(cid:8)

~x(1000+ik ) − ~x(1000+il )

~x(1000+i1), ~x(1000+i2), ~x(1000+i3), ..... ~x(1000+inF )

this, the fractals we ﬁnally use are deﬁned as the subset
F =
of all the iterates above the 1000th, (1 ≤ i1 < i2 <
(cid:9)
i3 < ....., < inf ), such that
≥ δ
for all k, l. In practice, we just skip iterates which are
(cid:12)
closer than δ to at least one of the previous iterates. (It
(cid:12)
is to note that this forcing of a smallest inter-point dis-
tance is not needed in the case of natural fractals, where
the elementary volumes they consist of cover any points
which lie too close. Stated diﬀerently, the sets we gener-
ate are ﬁnite fractals, whose properties we have to adjust
in order them to be good models for natural fractals; see
Sec. II A.)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

The theoretically expected dimension DF of the frac-

tals is given as

DF =

ln 1
8
ln a

,

(82)

for 0 < a < 0.5 (a > 0.5 implies DF = 3, and the sets
are not fractals; see e.g. [20]).

We generate the ﬁve sets F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 listed in
Table I for diﬀerent parameters a such that the corre-
sponding dimensions DF are 1, 1.5, 1.8, 2, 2.5, respec-
tively. We set δ = 0.5 (smallest scale) and l = 50 (radial
size), so that the fractal scaling behavior extends over
two orders of magnitude. The number of points nF of
the fractals should in principle be given by Eq. (4), but
δ∗ can be determined only a posteriori, after the fractals
have been generated. Instead of iterating the generation
procedure of the fractals in some way to achieve nF ac-
cording to Eq. (4), we determine nF as

nF =

DF

,

l
δ

(83)

(cid:18)
since most easily and straightforwardly δ, l and DF can
be prescribed to the generation of the fractals.

(cid:19)

Fig. 6 shows the set F3. We conﬁrmed the fractal di-
mension of the sets by estimating their correlation di-
mensions (Fig. 7, Table I). Table I also lists the most
probable nearest-neighbour distance δ∗ (determined in
the histograms of all the smallest inter-point distances,
as described and illustrated in Sec. II B), which is needed
as a parameter in the analytical relations we have derived
for pr.

2. The particle simulation

A number of particles np is chosen, and for each parti-
cle we choose a random point ~xi of the fractal and a ran-
dom spatial direction as initial conditions. We let each
particle move into the random direction and monitor at
what distance it passes by another point of the fractal
within a distance ρ, the cross-sectional radius, for the
ﬁrst time. The distances the particles travel are collected,
and their histogram ˆpr is constructed. Fig. 8 shows the

sectional radius ρ = δ/2 = 0.25, together with plots of
the analytically derived expressions for pr, Eqs. (16) and
(19), and of the approximate form Eqs. (28) of pr in the
cases DF < 2. Table I lists the power-law exponents (in
the case of power-laws). The coincidence between theory
and simulation is very satisfying, the theory describes
not just the functional form correctly, but also the po-
sition of the simulated histograms relative to the y-axis,
which means their normalization and therewith the es-
cape rate. The escape rates from theory and simulations
are also listed in Table I: the values are in reasonable
agreement.

To investigate the inﬂuence of boundary eﬀects, we
repeated the simulation for the set F3, with the starting
points of the particles now restricted to the interior of
the fractal. Fig. 9 shows the result: the boundary eﬀects
are obviously minor, the coincidence between simulation
and theory is not altered.

B. Particle simulations: testing the diﬀusive
behaviour

In a second Monte Carlo simulation, we intend to con-
ﬁrm the theoretically derived results on the diﬀusive be-
haviour. We do not use numerically generated fractals,
since they are bound to have relatively small size, the re-
lations though we want to verify are derived for asymp-
totically large systems (l → ∞). Thus, we directly use
the probability distribution of ﬂight increments pr [Eq.
(16), (19), or (28)] to determine the jump increments.
The directions of the jumps are random.

For a given dimension DF , we determine ﬁrst the prob-
ability νesc to move unaﬀected by the fractal forever [Eq.
(20) or (21)]. All the particles start at time t = 0 at
the origin. At the start as well as after every ’collision’
with the fractal (which in this simulation are mere turn-
ing points), the particles have a probability νesc to move
for ever unaﬀected by the fractal on a straight line path,
or else, with probability 1 − νesc, they perform a jump
of length randomly distributed according to pr [Eq. (16),
(19), or (28)] into a random direction and ’collide’ again

FIG. 6: Projective view of the fractal set F3 (dimen-
sion DF = 1.8; ﬁne dots) we use in the Monte Carlo
simulations (see Sec. VI A 1 and Table I for its detailed
properties). Over-plotted are the edges of a cube for bet-
ter visualization. The spatial Cartesian coordinates x, y,
and z are in arbitrary units.

with the fractal (actually they just arrive at their new
turning point). The results are shown in Figs. 10, 11,
and 12 for the cases DF = 0.5, DF = 1.5, and DF = 2.5,
respectively, together with power-law ﬁts: The diﬀusion
is ballistic in the cases DF < 2 (the index of the power-
law ﬁts is 2), and normal for DF > 2 (the index of the
power-law ﬁt at large times is 1), which conﬁrms our an-
alytical results [Eqs. (61), (74)].

The cases DF = 0.5 and DF = 1.5 show a very unam-
biguous behaviour, as a result of the high rate for unaf-
fected escape, which causes most particles not to collide
anymore with the fractal already after very few collisions,
i.e. after relatively short time. For DF = 2.5, diﬀusion
becomes normal only for large times, for small and in-
termediate times diﬀusion is enhanced: the index of the
power-law ﬁt at small times in Fig. 12 is 1.8.

VII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

A. Summary of the results

We have analytically derived the distribution of jump
increments for random walk through fractal environ-
ments, as well as the corresponding diﬀusive behaviour.
We discern between ﬁnite and asymptotically large sys-
tems, the latter being so large that the escape rate νesc
has practically settled to its asymptotic value. The main
results are:

Fractal dimension DF < 2:
(i) the distribution of walk increments can be considered
to be a power-law with index DF − 3;
(ii) there is always a ﬁnite rate of unaﬀected escape,
which is usually considerably large, even for asymptoti-

FIG. 10: The mean square displacement < r2(t) > vs.
time t for DF = 0.5 (solid), and a power-law ﬁt (dashed,
completely coinciding with solid).

time t for DF = 1.5 (solid), and a power-law ﬁt (dashed,

cally large systems; the distribution of jump increments
is thus defective;
(iii) the diﬀusion is ballistic.

Fractal dimension DF > 2:
(i) the distribution of walk increments is exponentially
decaying;
(ii) for asymptotically large systems, the escape rate is
zero, it becomes positive for ﬁnite systems;
(iii) the diﬀusion is normal for large times and large sys-
tems;
(iv) even for asymptotically large systems, there is a tran-
sient phase at small and intermediate times where diﬀu-
sion is enhanced.

All these results have been veriﬁed with Monte-Carlo
simulations. The theory we introduced predicts in par-
ticular in a satisfying way the escape rate and the point

17

listic [see Eq. (61)]:
from the beginning a considerable
fraction and after some time the vast majority of the
particles move freely according to ~r = ~vt, so that the
square displacement from the origin becomes ~r2 ∼ t2.
Diﬀusion is thus governed by the ﬁnite escape rate.

From the form of pr in the cases DF < 2 [Eq. 28], it
follows that pr is the steeper, the lower DF is, which im-
plies that for the thinner fractals (the ones with the lower
dimension) long jumps are less likely — this seems para-
doxical. The paradox is though resolved when taking the
escape rate into account: the lower DF is, the more par-
ticles move unaﬀected on straight line paths for ever, so
that actually long jumps — including the inﬁnite jumps
along unaﬀected paths — are more likely the lower DF
is.

For dimensions DF above 3, the fractals become eﬃ-
cient scatterers, they even force normal diﬀusion, though
only for large times.
In the regime of short and inter-
mediate times, diﬀusion is clearly diﬀerent from normal,
namely enhanced (see Fig. 12): The distribution of jump
increments pr is of power-law shape with an exponential
turn-over [Eq. (16)], and it seems that for intermediate
times (i.e. small jump increments) the power-law part
of pr is essential for the diﬀusive behaviour, whereas in
the large time regime the exponential roll-over starts to
dominate.

The analytical treatment of the diﬀusivity we pre-
sented is valid only for inﬁnitely large systems. For ﬁnite
systems, pr is defective also in the cases DF > 2, there
is a ﬁnite rate of unaﬀected escape (see Sec. II D), which
must be expected to modify the results we found here for
DF > 2 and inﬁnite systems, above all in the case of rel-
atively small systems. For large but ﬁnite systems, our
results concerning diﬀusion can be expected to remain
basically valid. The analytical study of ﬁnite size eﬀects
on diﬀusion we leave for a future study, it needs diﬀerent
mathematical methods than the ones applied here.

It is worthwhile noting that the distinctly diﬀerent be-
haviour of random walk through fractal environments we
found for the cases where DF is above or below 2 reﬂects
the property of mathematical fractals mentioned in Sec.
II A: scattering oﬀ mathematical fractals with dimension
below 2 is practically inexistent, with dimension above 2
it gets though very eﬃcient.

The cross-sectional radius ρ we used in the simula-
tions was the maximal allowed value, ρ = δ/2 (see Sec.
II A). Depending on the concrete application, ρ might
be smaller than δ/2, which would imply that in the cases
where the escape rate is ﬁnite, it will increase, and the
behaviour of the system will even more be dominated by
the escape rate.

The scattering process is strongly simpliﬁed in that we
assume that the velocity is conserved in magnitude in
collisions with the fractal, we do not model the energetic
aspects of the random walk at this stage.

We made the assumption that there are no correlations
between the incidence-direction and the escape-direction
for particles interacting with a point (elementary volume)

FIG. 12: The mean square displacement < r2(t) > vs.
time t for DF = 2.5 (solid), and two power-law ﬁts (both
dashed), one in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and the other in
the range 800 ≤ t ≤ 10 000.

where the distribution of jump increments turns over to
exponential in the cases DF > 2 — both these features
depend very sensitively on the parameters of the model,
as arguments of exponential functions.

The case DF = 2 is an exact power-law, and the escape
rate is zero for asymptotically large systems. We did not
treat the diﬀusive behaviour of this boundary case.

B. Discussion

The parameters which describe the problem of random
walks through fractal environments are the smallest dis-
tance δ between points of the fractal, the scale δ∗ where
the scaling of the fractal breaks down on the average, the
radial size l of the fractal, the dimension DF of the frac-
tal, the cross-sectional radius ρ of the points (elementary
volumes) of the fractal, and the velocity v of the random
walkers. The results (jump distribution pr, escape rate
νesc) do not depend on the absolute spatial scales, but
just on the relative scales l/δ∗ (the extent of the scaling
of the fractal), δ/δ∗ (which is close to 1, see Sec. II B),
and ρ/δ∗, which is in any case smaller than 1/2 (see Sec.
II A). Notably, the scaling range l/δ∗ does not inﬂuence
the functional form of pr. The velocity v is assumed to
be constant and plays just a minor role in our set-up.

The random walk in the cases DF < 2 is of the Levy
type (Sec. II E). The distribution of jump increments pr
is though defective, i.e. not normalized to one, which im-
plies a ﬁnite rate for unaﬀected escape (Sec. II D). Thus,
even for asymptotically large systems, particles interact
very restrictedly with fractals with dimension below 2,
they almost do not ’see’ the fractals and are almost not
hindered on their path, in their majority they move un-
aﬀected on a straight line path already after very few
collisions with the fractal. Consequently, diﬀusion is bal-

of the fractal, or more precise:
if there are correlations
between the incidence and escape direction, then only the
elementary volume should be in charge of this correlation,
it should not be caused by the over-all structure of the
fractal, so that ’seen’ from the view-point of the fractal,
incidence and escape directions appear to be random. In
plasmas though, the situation might be more complex,
there may be a background magnetic ﬁeld which guides
the particles, and the electric ﬁeld residing in the scat-
tering centers may be correlated in direction with the
magnetic ﬁeld.

We assumed open boundaries, particles leave the sys-
tem once the have reached the edge of the systems. In
realistic plasma applications, there may well be an eﬃ-
cient mechanism of reinjection, i.e. the particles are mir-
rored back into the system: In space plasmas, magnetic
mirroring at converging magnetic ﬁeld topologies is a
well known eﬀect, and in conﬁned plasmas with toroidal
topology, particles must be expected to reenter the frac-
tal (turbulent) region since they are forced to follow the
closed, torus-shaped magnetic ﬁeld.

Some of the histograms ˆpr of jump increments from the
simulations show a more or less strong oscillation super-
imposed onto the power-law behaviour (see Figs. 8 and
9), as do the estimates of the correlation integral (see Fig.
7). These oscillations are actually caused by lacunarity,
i.e. the property of a fractal to have systematically in-
terwoven empty regions (Mandelbrot in [15] discusses in
detail this property of fractals). In Ref.[21], it was shown
that the scaling behaviour n(r) ∝ rDF for fractals (see
Sec. II B) should actually be replaced by

n(r) ∝ rDF f (ln r/P ),

(84)

with f being an unknown periodic function of period 1.
The period P and the amplitude of the superimposed os-
cillations cannot be known a priori, they are an inherent
property of the concrete fractal under scrutiny. We de-
cided not to include this eﬀect in the theory. It contains
several parameters which are not easily estimated from a
fractal, and in many fractals (admittedly though not in
all), the amplitude of the oscillation is relatively small,
the oscillation is often rather like a ’higher order correc-
tion’, and it is a reasonably good approach to neglect the
eﬀect — as Fig. 8 shows, our theory catches quite well
the basic features of the fractals.

VIII. CONCLUSION

The theory presented here has potential applications to
permeable media, such as plasmas (stellar atmospheres,
the magnetosphere, conﬁned plasmas), with fractally dis-
tributed inhomogeneities (turbulence) which aﬀect parti-
cle motion. It connects the respective fractal structures
to random walks, and, eventually, to anomalous diﬀusion.
What we presented here is the basic analysis of random
walk through fractal environments. A next step will be

18

to extend the theory by including the random walk in ve-
locity space, which the particles perform in parallel to the
random walk in direct space. The velocity of the random
walkers will no more be constant, but it will change at
the collisions with the fractal on the base of a stochastic
model for the ﬁeld inhomogeneities (electric ﬁelds in the
case of plasmas). This will allow to study particle accel-
eration in turbulent media through the general approach
of random walks and stochastic processes.

APPENDIX A: ALTERNATIVE DERIVATION
OF THE ESCAPE RATE

In this Appendix, we conﬁrm Eqs. (20) and (21) for
the escape rate νesc in an alternative way, which reveals
the connection of νesc to the normalization µ of pr [Eq.
(26)]:

Since pr is the probability to travel freely a distance r

and then to collide with the fractal (see Sec. II C),

pr dr

is the probability to hit the fractal at all for a particle
which has started from a point of the fractal. The rate
of unaﬀected escape is therefore alternatively given as

l

δ
R

νesc = 1 −

pr dr

(A1)

l

Zδ

so that, with the deﬁnition of µ in Eq. (26), we have
νesc = 1 − µ, and Eq. (25) follows.

The jump distribution pr can be integrated analyti-
in the case DF 6= 2, the indeﬁnite integral of pr

Eq. (A3) together with Eq. (25) conﬁrms Eq. (20). The
conﬁrmation of Eq. (21) is completely analogous.

Eq. (A3) implies that µ ≤ 1 for any choice of the pa-
rameters δ, δ∗, and l (with δ ≤ δ∗ < l, see Sec. II A), the
interpretation of pr as a probability distribution is thus
consistent. In particular, from Eq. (A3) follows µ < 1 for
DF < 2, and pr is always defective. For DF > 2, we ﬁnd
µ ≤ 1, where µ = 1 only if l = ∞. The possibly ﬁnite es-
cape rate (νesc ≥ 0) discussed in Sec. II D is thus related
to the fact that µ ≤ 1, the probability distribution pr is
possibly defective, not necessarily normalized to 1.

APPENDIX B: FOURIER AND LAPLACE
TRANSFORMING THE PROBABILITY
DISTRIBUTIONS

The distributions ψ(~r, t), Φ(c)(~r, t), and Φ(e)(~r, t) are
all of the same functional form, so that their Fourier-
Laplace transforms are analogous. We demonstrate the
way we calculate these Fourier-Laplace transforms on the
example of the general function χ(~r, t), which is of the
form

χ(~r, t) = χ(r)δ(t − r/v),

(B1)

as are ψ(~r, t), Φ(c)(~r, t), and Φ(e)(~r, t), with δ ≤ r ≤ ∞,
δ/v ≤ t ≤ ∞, and where r := |~r|. Also the distribution
Φ(0)(~r, t) is of the form Eq. (B1), and basically the ex-
pressions we derive for χ(~r, t) are also valid for Φ(0)(~r, t),
with some modiﬁcations though, since Φ(0)(~r, t) has a ﬁ-
nite support (0 ≤ r ≤ δ). The treatment of Φ(0)(~r, t) will
be presented in App. B 4.

1. The Fourier transforms χ(~r, t)

The Fourier transform of χ(~r, t) in spherical coordi-

nates (r, θ, φ) is deﬁned as

integral, we can assume without loss of generality that
~k||ˆz, so that ~k · ~r = kr cos θ, where k := |~k|. Substituting

The δ-function in Eq. (B6) implies ﬁrstly r = vt, sec-
ondly t ≥ δ/v (since r ≥ δ), and thirdly that the entire
expression must be multiplied by v (as a substitution
r → ζ := t − r/v would bring forth), so that χ(~k, t) be-
comes

χ(~k, t) = 4πv2 t χ(vt)

(B7)

with t ≥ δ/v. Assuming kvt << 1 (see Sec. III B), we

χ(~k, t) ≈ 4πv3 t2 χ(vt) −

6 (kvt)3, which yields
4π

k2v5 t4 χ(vt).

For conciseness, it is useful to introduce the marginal
probability distribution λ(t) of χ(~r, t), integrated over
space,

λ(t) :=

χ(~r, t) d3r

=

χ(r)δ(t − r/v) r2 sin θ dr dφ dθ (B10)

where in Eq. (B10) we used spherical coordinates, and

over-all multiplication by v, so that ﬁnally

λ(t) = 4πv3t2χ(vt),

(B12)

with t ≥ δ/v. With the aid of λ(t), χ(~k, t) [Eq. (B7)] can
now be written as

χ(~k, t) = v−1t−1λ(t)

Assuming s << 1, we approximate the Laplace trans-

where we have again identiﬁed the functions B(n)(s) [see
Eq. (B21)].

Inserting Eqs. (B20) and (B24) into Eq. (B16) yields

form of χ(~r, t) [Eq. (B1)], in Eq. (B30) we did the τ -
integration, and in Eq. (B31) we introduced χr, the
marginal spatial probability distribution of χ(~r), inte-
grated over solid angle: χr :=
χ(~r) dσ (in analogy to
how pr is related to p(~r), see Sec. III). The normaliza-
tions of λ(t), χ(~r, t), χ(~r), and χr are thus identical and
are represented by µλ. In the case where χ(~r, τ ) repre-
sents ψ(~r, t), λ(t) corresponds to ϕ(t), and µλ is called
µ, see Sec. II D.

R

If all the moments hT niλ are ﬁnite up to n = 3, Eq.

(B20) can be written

λ(s) ≈ µλ − s · hT iλ,

(B32)

and if λ(t) is normalized to one, then we have furthermore
µλ = 1. (The ﬁrst moment hT iλ of λ(t) in the case where
χ(~r, t) represents ψ(~r, t) corresponds to the expected time
spent in a single jump increment.) With ﬁnite second and
third moments, Eq. (B24) becomes

In all cases, λ(t) is of a pure power-law form, λ(t) ∼ tα,
and the expressions B(n)(s)
[n = 0, 1, 2, 3; see Eq.

Eqs. (B32) and (B33) are formal in the sense that the
moments µλ, hT iλ, hT 2iλ, and hT 3iλ do not necessarily
exist, they may be inﬁnite. To determine the expressions
B(n)(s) for s → 0 and the moments of λ(t), if they exist,
we have to specify the diﬀerent cases which χ(~r, t) and
λ(t) represent.

a. The case DF > 2

For DF > 2, χ(~r, t) represents ψ(~r, t) or Φ(c)(~r, t). Us-
ing the relation Eq. (B12), we ﬁnd from Eq. (69) in the
case of ψ(~r, t) that

λ(ψ)(t) = CvDF −2 exp

−β(vt)DF −2

(B34)

and in the case of Φ(c)(~r, t) from Eq. (71) that

Through Eq. (B12), the corresponding functions λ(t) are
given for ψ(~r, t) from Eq. (52) as

λ(ψ)(t) = CvDF −2tDF −3,

for Φ(c)(~r, t) from Eq. (55) as

4. The Fourier Laplace transform of Φ(0)(~r, t)

The distribution Φ(0)(~r, t) has the same functional
form as χ(~r, t) [Eq. (B1)], just that its support is ﬁnite. It
can thus be treated analogous to χ(~r, t), and its Fourier
Laplace transform is given by Eq. (B25) on replacing the
functions B(n)(s) by the functions ¯B(n)(s),

¯B(n)(s) =

tn λ(t) e−st dt.

The marginal probability distribution λ(Φ(0))(t) is

is the same for DF > 2 and DF < 2),

λ(Φ(e))(t) = νescv.

5. The Laplace transform of ϕ(τ )

The Laplace transform of ϕ(τ ) (Secs. IV B and V B)
is given by Eq. (B20). In the case DF > 2, the function
λ(t) is given by Eq. (B34), with the expressions B(n)(s)
for s → 0 evaluated according to Eq. (B36). In the case
DF < 2, λ(t) is given by Eq. (B37), and again Eq. (B20)
yields the Laplace transform of ϕ(t), by using Eqs. (B41)
or (B45) to determine B(n)(s) for s → 0.

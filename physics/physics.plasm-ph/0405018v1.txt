Abstract. This paper studies the propagation of intense laser in plasmas in weak
relativistic region(0.1 < a2
0 < 0.5) using the quasi-periodic approximation. Eﬀective
Lorentz factor and density wave eﬀects are calculated in detail. The relativistic
correction on stimulated Brillouin instability is investigated in the rest parts. The
coupled dispersion relations of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering(SBS) are obtained and
investigated numerically.

1. Introduction

The propagation of intense laser through plasmas is an important concern in the laser-
driven inertial conﬁnement fusion, the laser-plasma accelerators, the x-ray laser and
In General, the amplitude of laser can be described
other physical problems [1]-[5].

by the normalized vector potential
the propagating equation of laser is linear. But many non-linear eﬀects will appear
when a increases , such as density wave eﬀects, relativistic mass correction, etc. While
a > 1, the problem becomes highly non-linear because of the relativistic eﬀects and it
can hardly be solved.

In full ionized plasmas, there are two dominating nonlinear eﬀects on the laser
propagation: one is the relativistic mass increase of the electron. When the amplitude
of vector potential a increases, the vibration velocity of electron increases and changes
the mass of electron to γm, where the Lorentz factor γ =
√1−v2/c2 is a coeﬃcient

determined by the velocity, so non-linear eﬀects appear.

The other important non-linear eﬀect is the laser’s diﬀraction by electron density
waves. When the intense laser propagates, electrons in the plasma ﬁrst vibrate parallel
to the electric ﬁeld and perpendicular to the propagating direction of the laser. Then
the vibrating elections are pushed by the Lorentz force produced by the magnet ﬁeld
of the laser. Electron density oscillations parallel to the propagating direction of the

laser form density waves. Finally, laser is diﬀracted by the density waves. As is shown
in the following, the density ﬂuctuation is proportion to a
a, its frequency is twice as
the laser frequency and its order is the same as relativistic eﬀect’s order. So the density
wave must be considered in the relativistic region.

·

In the relativistic region, both non-linear eﬀects cause corrections of the refract
index of the plasma by modifying the dispersion relation of the laser. The correction is
very important for the shaping and self-focusing of the intense laser pulse.

There are many parametric instabilities in plasmas such as Raman instability,
Brillouin instability and 2ω decay, etc. All these processes will be aﬀected by
the relativistic mass increase and the density wave eﬀects.
Stimulated Brillouin
Scattering(SBS) is a very important phenomenon because it transfers almost all energy
to the scattered light and reaches a maximum on backward scattering. In the case of
backward SBS, it causes laser’s reﬂection and the energy loss. During the implosion of
ICF, the Brillouin reﬂectivity can vary from 10%(for short wave incident laser) to more
than 40% (for long wave laser)[6]. In addition, the Brillouin Instability relates closely
with the ﬁlamentation instability.
In recent papers[8][9],

relativistic mass increase eﬀects are investigated by
introducing a Lorentz factor. However, because the Lorentz factor varies with the
electron’s jitter velocity, it takes on diﬀerent values for diﬀerent non-linear eﬀects and
should be calculated separately in diﬀerent cases. Besides, the SBS takes place in all the
under-dense region of plasmas, while Stimulated Raman Scatter(SRS) can take place
only in the low density region. Thus the density wave eﬀects should be considered.

Some authors[10][11] already considered the density wave eﬀects with the laser pulse
propagation without handling the SBS instability. Besides, the density wave equation
should be altered in the relativistic region (see sec. 2).

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the Brillouin instability of an intense
laser with a2
0.5. We call this intensity region as Weak-Relativistic Region.
Which indicates that the nonlinear eﬀects can be processed by the series expansion
with respect to a2. For calculating the Brillouin eﬀect ,we shall use the quasi-periodic
approximation to handle density wave eﬀects to get non-linear corrections of the laser’s
dispersion relation with higher precision in sec. 2. In sec. 3, we shall investigate the
Brillouin instability in the relativistic region.

2. The non-linear eﬀects of the intense laser propagating in Plasmas

Consider the propagation of a linear-polarized laser in a cold plasma in which the
electron’s thermal velocity is much smaller than their jitter speed in the laser ﬁeld[12].
Suppose the laser is polarized in the x direction and propagates in the z direction with
a < 1. Assuming the plasma be homogeneous in the transverse direction, we have, from
.
= √1 + a2,
the conservation of transverse canonical momentum[2], γβx = ax and γ
where β = v/c.

The laser propagation equation in this case has been derived by P. Sprangle and et

al [13] as follows:

where n is the density of electrons, n0 is the local average of n, kp = ωp/c and ωp

is the plasma frequency.

The plasma should satisfy Vlasov equation. In the cold plasma approximation we
ignore the thermal-pressure to get the continuity equation and the equation of motion
from the ﬁrst two moments of the Vlasov equation:

The above equations cannot be simpliﬁed to an ordinary wave equation as in non-
relativistic case due to the presence of γ under derivative operations. The non-linear
eﬀects must be treated separately for high frequency, low frequency and zero-frequency
cases to get the correct dispersion relations.

In the quasi-periodic approximation we assume that the characteristic time of
evolution of the laser pulse shape is much longer than the laser’s period, and a can
be regarded approximately as a periodic function. Let a .

is the unit vector in the x direction. Now all of the coeﬃcients and driving forces in
eq. (2) and (3) are periodic functions, so its solutions should be periodic far from their
instability region.

The approximation is similar to the quasi-stationary approximation used by
P.Sprangle et al [13], but now the phase velocity of the laser wave in the plasma, ω0/k0,
does not need be close to c. So this approximation can be used for dense plasmas.

The coupled equations (8) and (9) are the fundamental equations for the Stimulated
Brillouin Scattering in the weak relativistic region. There are two diﬀerences between
the present equations and the normal Brillouin equations. First, the factor √1 + a2

2a2. Second, in the propagation equation, the density wave
term ψL˜as and the relativistic term 3
L˜as cause a new eﬀect, which is the sideband

In the weak relativistic region,the
ion acoustic waves become the quasi-mode whose frequency is determined by the laser
intensity. Correspondingly, the relative value of growing rate and the laser frequency will
far exceed the ratio cs/c and approach to 1

It means that the Brillouin instability will have developed during about several tens to
a few hundreds periods of the pump laser(about 10−13

In the region we analyzed,the pure growing modes with Re(ω) = 0 appear at large
k. First, The peak value of the growing rate locates near k = 2kp and has a departure
due to the relativistic eﬀects. Then, the pure growing modes appear at large k when the
laser intensity and the plasma density increase. In the weak relativistic region, the pure
growing modes form a plateau region. The pure growing mode at large k will aﬀect on
some nonlinear eﬀects like turbulence developing.

Ignore the relativistic terms and the frequency-mixing terms, the dispersion relation
(12) returns to the non-relativistic four-wave dispersion relation of Brillouin scatter.
We can solve the non-relativistic dispersion relation and compare the result with the
relativistic result. All the results are plotted in ﬁgure 3. In which we can ﬁnd the eﬀects
of relativity and frequency-mixing are: (1)move the peak value; (2)reduce the growing
rate of instability. The reduction is larger in the plateau region of pure growing modes.
So the Brillouin reﬂection rate will be reduced by the eﬀects.

4. Conclusion

The present paper applied the quasi-periodic approximate method for the stable laser
propagation in weak relativistic plasmas. The Stimulated Brillouin Scatter in relativistic
region is investigated in detail. The growing rates are re-calculated numerically and the
sideband-mixing eﬀects are considered. The Brillouin instability is reduced by these
eﬀects. For the plateau region of pure growing modes, the reduction is more evidence.

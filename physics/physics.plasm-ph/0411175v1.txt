The Child-Langmuir law relates the voltage applied across a planar diode to the saturation value
JCL of current density that can be transmitted through it in case the injection velocity of electrons
into the diode is zero. The Child-Langmuir current density JCL is, at the same time, (i) the maxi-
mum current density that can be transmitted through a planar diode, (ii) the current density below
which the ﬂow is steady and unidirectional in the long time limit and (iii) the average transmitted
current density for any value of injected current density above JCL. Existing generalizations of
Child-Langmuir law to non-zero velocities of injection are based on the characteristics (i) and (ii)
of JCL. This paper generalizes the law to non-zero velocities of injection based on the characteristic
(iii) by deriving an analytical expression for the saturation value of current density. The analytical
expression for the saturation current density is found to be well supported by numerical computa-
tions. A reason behind preferring the saturation property of the Child-Langmuir current density as
the basis for its generalization is the importance of that property in numerical simulations of high
current diode devices.

I. INTRODUCTION

The celebrated Child-Langmuir law is widely used in
many areas of physics where charged particle transport
across a potential diﬀerence is involved [1]. It gives the
maximum current density JCL that can be transported
from an inﬁnite planar cathode at zero potential to an
inﬁnite planar anode parallel to the cathode at a distance
L and potential V when the initial velocity v0 of electrons
at the cathode is zero. This maximum value is a result of
the space charge eﬀect and, in the non-relativistic limit,
is given by

Here, e is the magnitude of the charge on an electron and
m is its rest mass. For convenience, the terms “current”
and “current density” are used interchangeably. They
refer to the current density denoted by J.

There have been several attempts to generalize the law
(1) to other situations such as to higher dimensions or to
non-zero velocities of injection [2]- [6]. The characteris-
tics of JCL on which such generalizations are based are
one or the other of the following: (i) JCL is the maximum
current that can be transmitted across one-dimensional
planar diode with zero velocity of injection, and (ii) the
ﬂow of current in the long time limit is steady and uni-
directional if the injected current is less than JCL but
oscillatory in time above it. The generalization based
on characteristic (i) to non-zero injection velocity, v0, of
electrons in to a planar diode shows that the space charge
limiting current

is the maximum current that can be transmitted across
the diode and is identiﬁed as the generalized Child-

Langmuir current [5]. The generalization based on char-
acteristic (ii), on the other hand, shows that the current
in the diode is unidirectional till it attains the value JBF
and starts reﬂecting thereafter with

This current, JBF , marking the bifurcation of the state
from completely to partially transmitting is proposed in
Ref. [6] as a generalized Child-Langmuir current.

A third characteristic that is commonly ignored in
such attempts is the fact that JCL is the saturation cur-
rent that is transmitted for zero velocity of injection for
any injected current higher than JCL. It is the existence
of saturation current in a planar diode that we wish to
explore in this communication for non-zero velocities of
injection and call the relation between such a saturation
current, the injection velocity, the diode spacing and volt-
age as the generalized Child-Langmuir law.

The reason for emphasising the saturation property is
that it helps in simulations involving high current de-
vices. For, the existence of a saturation current implies
that one need not bother about the material dependent
cathode characteristics (the Richardson-Dushman law in
case of thermionic emission or the Fowler-Nordheim law
for ﬁeld emission) so long as the current emitted from the
cathode surface is more than what gives rise to the sat-
uration value of the transmitted current. This condition
simpliﬁes considerably the task of numerical simulation.
Though the injection velocity of electrons in many de-
vices can be taken as zero, in several others non-zero in-
jection velocities do arise (see [1] and references therein).
The magnitude of the velocity can be related to physi-
cally measurable quantities such as the temperature in
case of thermionic emission or the frequency of the inci-
dent ﬁeld in case of photoemission. Since, as in the case
= 0
of v0 = 0, existence of a saturation current for v0

6
may enable one to ignore the cathode characteristics for
appropriate injected currents, it is important to know
for what values of injected current and to what value,
if any, does the transmitted current saturate if v0
= 0.
The main result of this paper is that as the current in-
jected in to a planar diode is increased beyond its space
charge limiting value, the current transmitted through it
saturates asymptotically to the value

The relation (4) is derived in the framework of a phe-
nomenological theory, called the classical theory. The
validity of that theory is assessed by comparison with
numerical solution of the equations.

The paper is organised as follows. In Sec.2 we recall
the main results of the steady state theory leading to the
expression for the space charge limiting current. Some
details of derivation of those results are outlined in the
Appendix A. The classical theory for currents exceeding
the space charge limiting current is presented in Sec.3.
The results of numerical computation are presented in
Sec.4.

II. SPACE CHARGE LIMITING CURRENT

Consider a diode consisting of two inﬁnite parallel
plates placed at z = 0 and z = L where z is the direc-
tion orthogonal to the plates. Let an electronic ﬂuid of
uniform and same cross-section as the plates move along
the z-direction. Its motion in the Eulerian formalism is
governed by the equations [7]

where ρ(z, t) and J(z, t) are respectively the charge and
current densities of the electronic ﬂuid, p(z, t) is the mo-
mentum of the electron whereas φ(z, t) and E(z, t) are
the potential and the electric ﬁeld at the position z at
time t.

We consider the case when a stream of electrons of
constant charge density ρ0 enters the diode at z = 0
with each electron in the stream entering with the same
velocity v0 along the z-direction so that

ρ(0, t) = ρ0,

J(0, t)

ρ(0, t)v0 = J0.

(6)

φ(0, t) = 0,

φ(L, t) = V.

(7)

Because of the deﬁning relation between the ﬁeld and the
potential, the condition (7) may be rewritten as

L

E(z, t)dz = V.

(8)

A complete description of the motion of the electronic
ﬂuid is provided by solving equations (5) under the
boundary condition (7) or (8).

→ ∞

A state of interest, called a steady state, is the one
that the system reaches asymptotically in time i.e. as
t
. The evaluation of space charge limiting current
requires solving the steady state form of the equations
obtained by equating to zero the partial derivatives with
respect to time in the Eulerian formalism. It is evident
from (5) that the current density in this case is not only
independent of time but is also the same at every plane.
If there is no reﬂection of electrons from anywhere in the
diode then the current density in the diode is everywhere
the same as is pumped in at its entrance so that, in the
steady state, J(z, t)
ρ(z, t)v(z, t) = J0. The ﬁrst of the
equations in (5) then assumes the form

in the next section which concerns the situation involving
returning currents.

Alternative to the Eulerian formalism which charac-
terizes the motion in terms of hydrodynamical variables
like charge and current densities as function of space and
time, is the Lagrangian formalism which is based on de-
termining the trajectories of the electrons. An electronic
trajectory in the one-dimensional motion under consid-
eration is identiﬁed by the time t0 at which it enters the

completeness and clarity, and in order to ﬁll the gaps
in the available derivations, we present in Appendix A
the solution of (16) for the steady state corresponding to

The injected current J0 in the steady state is transmitted
completely to the anode where the electrons arrive with
velocity v1 which, by virtue of the energy conservation
relation (10), is given by

¯v1 =

The main results of the steady state solution are:

p

(17)

(18)

1. The steady state is determined by solving the cubic
(A9) for the transit time ¯T (1) of an electron across
the diode. The ﬂow of current is unidirectional and
independent of time if that cubic admits physically
acceptable solution.

2. The cubic admits two positive roots, ¯T2(1) and
¯T3(1), given in (A14), if the value of the injected
current α

is the space charge limiting current. By invoking
(12), it may be veriﬁed that the expression for the
injected current J0 corresponding to α given above
is the same as in (2) and that if v0 = 0 then

JSCL = JCL,

v0 = 0,

(20)

where JCL is given by (1). In other words, for zero
velocity of injection, the space charge limiting cur-
rent is the same as the Child-Langmuir current.

αDR, the root ¯T3(1) corresponds to
negative velocities in certain region of the diode

injected current. However, both the roots, ¯T2(1)
and ¯T3(1) are acceptable if αDR
αSCL where

α

≤

αDR = (1 + ¯V 3/4)2.

(21)

The suﬃx DR on α stands for ”double root”: it is
the value of the current above which steady state
equation has two admissible roots. The linear sta-
bility analysis shows that, in the range mentioned
above, ¯T3(1) leads to unstable steady state. Hence,
¯T2(1) deﬁnes the acceptable stable steady state for
all α

αSCL.

≤

4. The ﬂow of current ceases to be unidirectional and
time-independent if the injected current exceeds
αSCL.

The above-mentioned characteristics of the steady state
solution are exhibited in Fig.1 by the plot of the elec-
tric ﬁeld ¯E0 at the cathode evaluated using (A16) for
¯V = 1.2. The point A in the ﬁgure corresponds to the
space charge limiting current αSCL whereas the point B
represents αDR. The branches OA and AB in that ﬁg-
ure correspond, respectively, to ¯T2(1) and ¯T3(1) given by
(A14). The branch AB represents unstable steady state.
The uppermost branch of the curve for α > αDR is a
result of the classical theory outlined in the next section.
The value of ¯E0 at αDR where the unstable steady state
corresponding to ¯T3(1) merges with the classical theory,
found using (A16), is given by

¯E0DR =

(1 + ¯V 3/4).

(22)

We will see that, as it should be, this value is the same
as that obtained by the classical theory.

By transforming back to the unnormalized variables,
the results above may be applied to the case of v0 = 0.
It may be veriﬁed that the expression for space charge
limiting current density J0, found using (19) in this case
is the well-known Child-Langmuir current JCL given in
(1) and that, correspondingly, E0 = 0. We thus see that,
contrary to the standard treatments of the case of v0 = 0,
E0 = 0 is not an imposed condition but is a natural
consequence of the governing equations of motion. This
fact has also been emphasised in [5].

Since the space charge limiting current αSCL is the
maximum current that can be transmitted across the
diode, it is proposed in [5] that αSCL may be identi-
ﬁed as the generalized Child-Langmuir current and (19)
as the generalized Child-Langmuir current-voltage rela-
tion. However, as we have argued in the Introduction,
an important characteristic of Child-Langmuir current is
that it is the current transmitted across the diode for
any injected current above αSCL. We, therefore, need
to examine the behaviour of the transmitted current for
α > αSCL.

As shown in the Appendix A, the system does not ad-
mit a steady state corresponding to unidirectional ﬂow of

3

current if α > αSCL. Hence, the behaviour of the system
for α > αSCL is determined by solving time-dependent
equations. Since solving time-dependent equations ana-
lytically is a formidable task, those equations are solved
numerically. However, a qualitative understanding of the
phenomenon is achieved by a simple model which as-
sumes that, though for α > αSCL the current may not
be unidirectional, it nevertheless attains a steady state
with current ﬂowing in two directions in some region in
the diode. This theory, called the classical theory, is out-
lined in the next section. It is along the lines of the theory
in Ref. [7] for the case of grounded plates.

III. ASYMPTOTICALLY SATURATING
CURRENT

≤

The analysis outlined in the Appendix A holds good
for α
αSCL in which case the injected and the trans-
mitted currents are equal. The classical theory assumes
that, beyond αSCL, the minima of the potential within
the diode assumes a value which is such that the velocity
of an electron there reduces to zero. The equations (10)
and (13) show that v = 0 is attained when ¯φ = 0. Hence,
the boundary condition at the position ¯z = ¯zm of the
potential minima is

In the problem at hand, the minima at
¯z = ¯zm, therefore, is the only one admissible so that the
electrons are decelerated while moving from the cathode
to the position of minima at ¯z = ¯zm and are accelerated
thereafter. Hence, the minus sign in the solution above
holds in the region 0
¯z < ¯zm whereas the plus sign is
to be retained in the region ¯zm < ¯z < 1. On integrat-
ing (27) in the two regions with appropriate values of C

The unknowns ¯zm and f in the expressions above are de-

lead to the relations

These equations determine two unknowns, the position

between these equations, the expression determining f
reads

It is straightforward to verify that df /dα < 0. Hence, f
is a decreasing function of α. Now, (33) shows that the
value f = 1 is attained when α = αBF where

According to classical theory, this is, therefore, the mini-
mum value of α for which reﬂecting solution exists. The
subscript BF on αBF indicates that the steady state bi-
furcates into two diﬀerent types at αBF: the steady state
corresponds to unidirectional ﬂow of injected current α if
α
αBF whereas it starts reﬂecting if α > αBF. On com-
paring (34) with (21) it follows that αDR = αSCL i.e. the
bifurcation of the steady state from unidirectional ﬂow to
partially reﬂecting ﬂow takes place at the same value of
current above which there are two solutions for the uni-
directional ﬂow, one stable and another unstable. The
electric ﬁeld at the entrance of the diode for α = αBF,
obtained using (30), reads

This is the same as the one in (22) obtained using the
steady state solution for α = αDR.

It may be veriﬁed that the current J0 corresponding
to αBF is given by (3). Since the bifurcation point marks
the onset of reﬂections, which is one of the character-
istic properties of the Child-Langmuir current, the cur-
rent αBF at the bifurcation point is identiﬁed in Ref. [6]
as the Child-Langmuir current. However, the numeri-
cal solution of equations shows that reﬂection does not
start at the bifurcation point.
It starts only when the
injected current exceeds its space charge limiting value
αSCL which is higher than its value at the bifurcation
point except when v0 = 0 in which case, a comparison of
(2) and (3) shows that

JBF = JSCL,

v0 = 0.

(36)

On comparing with (1) it follows that these currents are
the same as the Child-Langmuir current JCL.

The behaviour of ¯E0 for partially reﬂecting solution
is exhibited in Fig.1 by the branch of the curve above
the bifurcation point B. That branch is obtained by
computing ﬁrst the fraction f of the transmitted current
by solving 33 for a given α. The value of f so obtained
is substituted in 30 to evaluate ¯E0.

Before proceeding further, we digress to rewrite
Eq.(32) to express the transmitted current f α in the form

f α =

(1 + eV /ε)
¯zm)2

(37)

This resembles the expression derived by Langmuir [8] for
the thermionic current from a hot cathode emitting into a
diode. Langmuir’s expression in question reduces exactly
to (37) if the cathode temperature is zero whereas it gives
the current approximately if the temperature is non-zero
but low. It should, however, be emphasised that in the
model under discussion, all the electrons are injected in
to the diode with the same velocity whereas, in the pa-
per of Langmuir, the electronic velocities at the entrance
are distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution.
The position ¯zm of the potential minimum in (37) deter-
mining f α itself depends on f . Hence, evaluation of (37)
requires a relation between ¯zm and f which, in our case,
is contained in (31).

The Eq.(33) leads to the following useful expression

for the transmitted current,

where JCL is the Child-Langmuir current (1). This is
the current transmitted for any injected current above
its space charge limiting value. This value of current is
the same as the value of the space charge limiting current
(2) corresponding to v0 = 0. It therefore follows that, for
v0 = 0, the transmitted current saturates at JCL as soon
as the injected current attains its space charge limiting
value.

ties, obtained from (38) in the limit f

paring its predictions with numerical results in the next
section.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we present a comparison of the predic-
tions of the steady state theories and numerical compu-
tations carried out using the sheet model [7]. The com-
parison is carried by computing the transmitted current
JTR as a function of the injected current J0 (α is related
to J0 by Eq. (12) ).

The injected current J0 in the sheet model corresponds
to injecting N sheets per unit time (L/(2eV /m)1/2)
into the diode, each having a surface charge density
σ = J0/N . By counting the sheets starting from the
one closest to the collecting plate, it can be shown that
when there are M sheets in the drift space, the electric
ﬁeld on the kth sheet at the position zk from the entrance
plate is given by

The numerical computations conﬁrm the theoretical
αSCL, the system approaches a
prediction that, for α
steady state asymptotically as t
. However, contrary
to the premise of the classical theory, the asymptotic be-
haviour of the system in time is found to be oscillatory
if α > αSCL. Hence, for α > αSCL, the predictions of the
classical theory are compared with the results of numer-
ical computations averaged over several cycles of oscilla-
tions after the initial transients have settled. See Ref. [9]
for a plot of oscillating transmitted current as a function
of time for injected current in excess of the SCL current
in a short-circuited diode.

The Fig.2 is a plot of theoretical predictions and nu-
merically computed values of the transmitted current
JTR as a function of the injected current J0 for ε = 0
and for ε/eV = 0.2 with L = .008m and V = 250V.
The bold straight line represents JTR = J0 which is the
prediction of the steady state theory for currents below
the space charge limiting value. The square dots on that
line are the results of numerical computations indicating
agreement between analytical and numerical solutions for
currents below the space charge limiting value.

The numerical results of computation for currents ex-
ceeding the space charge, carried in the manner outlined
above, are represented by the square dots. The dashed-
dotted straight line (a) is drawn to join the dots corre-
sponding to ǫ = 0 whereas the dashed-dotted curve (b)
for ε/eV = 0.2 joins the dots corresponding to ε = 0.2.
Recall that the classical theory predicts that if ε = 0
then JTR = JCL for all J0. For the values of the param-
eters used in the ﬁgure, the value of the Child-Langmuir
current is JCL
143.9 which practically coincides with
the corresponding numerical results represented by the
straight line (a). Hence, the theoretical predictions are
in agreement with numerical results for any value of the
injected current if ε = 0.

The theoretical plot for ε/eV = 0.2 is represented by
the dashed curve marked “classical theory”.
It is ob-
tained by solving (33) for f for a given value of α and
using the value of f so obtained to evaluate the trans-
mitted current JTR = f α. On comparing the classical
theory plot with the corresponding results of numerical
computations represented by the curve (b), it is seen that
the agreement between the two is not close. For, in dis-
agreement with the monotonic behaviour predicted by
the classical theory, the numerical plot exhibits a max-
ima in αTR as a function of α. The reason behind the
appearance of the maxima is left as an open question.
However, the asymptotic limit of the numerical plot of

αTR appears to be in agreement with the prediction (41)
of the classical theory. In order to conﬁrm the apparent
agreement we examine the asymptotic behaviour of the

ﬁtting best the numerical results. The Fig.3 shows some
values of JTR computed numerically along with the curve
(46) ﬁtting best the numerical results as a function of
J0. The best ﬁt is obtained for a = 193.58, b = 2318.83
and β = 0.40. Hence, (46) approaches asymptotically the
value JTR = 193.58 which agrees very well with the value
JTR = 189.37 obtained using the theoretical expression
(42). We have observed similar agreement between the-
oretical prediction and the numerical computations for
several other values of the injected velocity.

Finally, we study the behaviour of the (time-averaged)
position of the virtual cathode as a function of the in-
jected current J0 for ε = 0.2. Fig. 4 shows a plot of
the time-averaged normalized position of the potential
minimum (¯zm) as a function of J0. As in the case of
short-circuited diode, ¯zm decreases with J0. Fig. 4 also
shows the prediction of the classical theory (bold line)

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have sought to generalize the Child-
Langmuir law for non-zero injection velocities based on
the saturation property of the time-averaged transmitted
current. The reason for preferring the saturation prop-
erty for the said generalization is its importance in nu-
merical simulations. For, as stated in the Introduction,
the emission characteristics of cathode and the details of
the emission mechanism do not play any role in determin-
ing the transmitted current if that current is independent
of (or weakly dependent on) the injected current. This
is the case when the current emitted from the cathode
surface (J0) is more than what gives rise to the satu-
ration value of the transmitted current. This condition
simpliﬁes considerably the task of numerical simulation.
Thus, if we characterize the Child-Langmuir current
as the saturation current then αGCL given in Eq. (42) is
the Child-Langmuir current generalized to non-zero ve-
locities of injection. That expression for the saturation
current is derived by assuming a steady ﬂow of current
under the condition that a part of the current is reﬂected
from the virtual cathode. Eq. (42) is found to be in
fairly good agreement with numerical computations. In
contrast to the case of zero velocity of injection for which
saturation is attained at the space charge limiting value
of the injected current, the saturation in the case of non-
zero velocities is attained only asymptotically. Hence,
though the details of the emission characteristic of cath-
ode may be ignored safely in numerical simulations for

6

any injected current above its space charge limiting value
in case v0 = 0, the injected current for v0
= 0 needs to
be very much above its space charge limiting value for
cathode characteristics to become unimportant.

APPENDIX A: STEADY STATE IN
LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM

In this Appendix we present steady state solution of
the Eq.(16) describing the ﬂow of current in Lagrangian
formalism.

This equation is arrived at by noting that the electron
at time t = t0 is at z = 0. Hence, the initial condition
is the same as the condition at z = 0 so that, by virtue
of the last equation in (5), ∂v(t, t0)/∂t =
eE0/m at
t = t0. The equation (A1) may be integrated further
to obtain expressions for v(t, t0) and z(t, t0). Like (A1),
those equations involve two unknown functions: the ﬁeld
and the current at all times at the entrance plate. The
current at the entrance plate consists of the current being
constantly pumped in and the current returning, if any,
after reﬂection from some position between the plates.
Our interest here is in the steady state without returning
currents. The current at the entrance plate in that case
is the same as that being pumped in i.e.

for those values of α for which ¯T3(1) leads to negative
velocities. Those values of α may be identiﬁed by noting

where αDR is given by (21). In other words, if α satisﬁes
the condition (A23) then the root ¯T3(1) satisﬁes the con-
dition (A20) required for the velocity to become negative
in some region in the diode leaving ¯T2(1) as the only ac-
αDR whereas both,
ceptable root in the range 0
¯T2(1) and ¯T3(1), are acceptable if αDR
α < (1 + ¯v1)3.
The αDR denotes the value of the current above which
there are two roots. However, the linear stability anal-
ysis shows that the root ¯T3(1) is unstable. Hence, only
¯T2(1) corresponds to a stable steady state in the range
0

≤
The discriminant ∆ > 0 if α > (1 + ¯v1)3. The cubic
(A9) determining the transit time in this case has one
real and a pair of complex conjugate roots. Since the
transit time is a real quantity, the real root is the only
one which needs to be examined further for its accept-
ability. To that end, we note that the product of the
54/α, is negative. Hence, the
roots of (A9), given by
real root in case of ∆ > 0 must be negative. Since the
time of transit is a positive number, the negative root is
physically unacceptable. The cubic (A9), therefore, does
not admit physically acceptable solution i.e. the system
does not approach a time-independent steady state hav-
ing unidirectional ﬂow of current if α > αSCL where

−

αSCL = (1 + ¯v1)3

(A24)

is the space charge limiting current: The space charge
limiting current is the value of the current above which
the ﬂow of current is no longer unidirectional and time-
independent. It is also the maximum current that can
be transmitted across the diode even when the injected
current is increased indeﬁnitely.

The solution of (A9) for α = αSCL gives the transit

which, on substitution in (A10) yields

Large-Mode-Number MHD Instability Driven by Sheared Flows
in Reversed-Shear Tokamak Plasmas

A fast growing Kelvin-Helmholtz-like ideal MHD instability with high dominant mode numbers
m, n ∼ 10 is observed using numerical simulations where a narrow sub-Alfv´enic shear ﬂow layer is
present in the region of low magnetic shear in a reversed-shear tokamak conﬁguration. The linear
growth rates increase with the shearing rate, and the width of the spectrum of unstable modes is
controlled by the shear layer width. In the presence of non-ideal eﬀects the instability drives magnetic
reconnection and forms turbulent structures in the nonlinear regime. Possible applications of these
results in laboratory and space plasmas are discussed.

Sheared ﬂows in magnetized plasmas are frequently en-
countered in space and laboratory. They play an impor-
tant role in conﬁnement through their ability to reduce
transport of energy and particles in the direction per-
pendicular to the shear layer. This has attracted much
attention in the thermonuclear-fusion-oriented branch of
plasma physics, where steep gradients in temperature
and plasma pressure need to be maintained between the
cold wall and the hot core. While a velocity shear layer
in a ﬂuid is often subject to the well-known Kelvin-
Helmholtz instability (KHI), in magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) systems the KHI has to compete with ﬁeld line
tension, magnetic pressure and magnetic shear [1]. Re-
gions in the plasma which are particularly susceptible
to KHI are therefore those where it can couple with
MHD instabilities. A system where such coupling is ex-
pected to play an important role, and which motivated
the present study, is the reversed-shear (RS) advanced
tokamak conﬁguration, which is a strong candidate for
achieving self-sustained nuclear fusion conditions. It has
a non-monotonic toroidal current proﬁle [Fig.1(a)] and
the magnetic shear, s = (r/q)dq/dr, changes its sign at
some radius rmin. Here r is the radial coordinate (mi-
nor radius of the torus), and q(r) is the safety factor
proﬁle measuring the ﬁeld line pitch [Fig.1(a)]. In the re-
gion with negative shear (r < rmin) pressure-driven MHD
ballooning modes are stable, so that higher pressures can
be achieved in the core. Conﬁnement in RS tokamaks is
further improved by strongly sheared poloidal ﬂows. It
is believed that these zonal ﬂows play an important role
for internal transport barrier (ITB) which typically occur
near the shear-reversal surface rmin [2]. MHD instabil-
ities are often observed in ITB discharges [3, 4]. There
is evidence that certain ITB equilibria with strong pres-
sure gradient in the region of weakly positive shear may
be stable to ideal MHD ballooning modes, in particular
when operating with low-order rational values of qmin [5].
On the other hand, the low shear around qmin may allow
pressure-driven infernal modes to develop [6, 7].

In this study we exclude pressure-gradient driven in-

stabilities and focus on the interaction between the shear
ﬂow and current-driven modes. The RS-type equilibrium
model shown in Fig. 1 is used, where qmin . 2 and a
shear-ﬂow layer is located just inside rmin. Around rmin
there are pairs of magnetic surfaces, rs1 < rmin < rs2,
where the safety factor q has the same rational value
qs = q(rs1) = q(rs2) = m/n (dotted lines in Fig.1). When
rs1 is suﬃciently small, the res-
the distance D12 = rs2
onances couple and double tearing modes (DTM) with
high poloidal and toroidal mode numbers m and n can
become unstable [8, 9]. Diﬀerential rotation is known to
have a stabilizing eﬀect through its tendency to decouple
the resonances [10, 11]. In the nonlinear regime DTMs
may overcome this eﬀect through locking between ﬁnite-
size magnetic islands and by nonlinear ﬂattening of the
velocity gradient [12, 13]. Thus, a dynamic interaction
between DTMs and the ITB is expected [3].

−

In this Letter we demonstrate that suﬃciently strong
velocity shear present in a region which, in the stationary

state, is unstable to DTMs, induces rapidly growing ideal
MHD instabilities with high mode numbers m, n
10.
First, the linear instability characteristics of these modes
are described. Second, nonlinear simulation results are
presented for a case with ﬁnite resistivity, where the in-
stability is shown to transform into a tearing-type mode
and has a tendency develop turbulent structures. Fi-
nally, we discuss possible applications of our results for
understanding ITB dynamics and, more generally, KH-
like instabilities in both in fusion and space plasmas.

For simplicity, we use the well-known reduced magne-
tohydrodynamic (RMHD) model in cylindrical geometry
and include a small electrical resistivity to allow mag-
netic reconnection to occur. Adopting a form similar to
that in Ref. [9] the RMHD equations for the magnetic
ﬂux ψ and the vorticity uz are, in SI units,

Here, ρm is the mass density, η the resistivity and ν

In the following, time is
and uz =
measured in units of the poloidal Alfv´en time τHp =
√µ0ρmia/B0 (with B0 being the strong axial magnetic
ﬁeld) and the radial coordinate normalized by the minor
radius of the plasma, a. Resistive dissipation is mea-
sured by the magnetic Reynolds number SHp = τη/τHp
(with τη = a2µ0/η being the resistive diﬀusion time)
and viscous damping by the kinematic Reynolds number
ReHp = a2/ντHp. The perturbed ﬁelds are Fourier trans-
formed as
inz/R0) (with
R0 being the major radius of the torus). The model and
numerical methods are described in detail in Refs. [9, 14].
The destabilizing eﬀect of diﬀerential rotation studied
here enters through the linear vorticity gradient term,
ρm(im/r)
z0 = duz0/dr). Since it
is part of the inertia term we call the modes for which
it plays a signiﬁcant role inertial modes, thereby distin-
guishing them from predominantly current-driven modes.
Inertial modes are a manifestation of the same mecha-
nism that gives rise to KHIs but we prefer not to equate
the two. Due to the sub-Alfv´enic velocity used the pres-
ence of resonant surfaces is crucial, with low-m modes
even requiring two nearby resonances. Furthermore, we
show that multiple branches of inertial modes (ideal and
resistive) can be destabilized simultaneously.

The equilibrium conﬁguration used is shown in Fig. 1.
The safety factor proﬁle has two qs = 2 surfaces a small
distance D12 = 0.06 apart (rs1 = 0.383, rs2 = 0.446).
The magnetic shear at these resonances is s1 =
0.10
and s2 = 0.12. The poloidal velocity proﬁle vϑ0 consists
of an almost rigidly rotating core component and a shear
layer near rmin such that the plasma is at rest at r = 1:

The standard case for ωϑ0 is shown in Fig. 1(b). The
shear layer is located near the inner resonance (r0 = 0.4)
and has a width (2d = 0.04) comparable to D12. The
parameter G controls core rotation and thus the shear-
ing rate between the resonances. We deﬁne the spe-
ω01)/2π [with ω0i =
ciﬁc shearing rate as ∆f = (ω02
ωϑ0(rsi)]. The eﬀective shearing rate for the mode (m, n)
is ∆fm = m∆f . Since the equilibrium ﬂow is not in-
cluded self-consistently only sub-Alfv´enic velocities are

equilibrium and the shear ﬂow are separately unstable:
the former to resistive DTMs [9] and the latter to the
ideal KHI [1]: the Rayleigh criterion for KHI is fulﬁlled
[u′
z0(r0) = 0] and the existence of an instability threshold
mmax, is demonstrated shortly.

Results obtained by solving the linearized RMHD
equations as an initial-value problem for the q proﬁle in
Fig. 1(a) are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. The data were
obtained with SHp = 107 and ReHp = 1011, so the viscos-
ity eﬀect is negligible [9]. In Fig. 2(a) the linear growth
rates γlin and in Fig. 2(b) the linear frequencies ωlin of
several modes are plotted as functions of G.

≥

0 is considered.

The γlin(G) curves in Fig. 2(a) are symmetric around
G = 0, so only G
In the range
0 < G . 1.0, the eﬀect of the shear ﬂow is primarily
a stabilizing one. However, it can be seen in Fig. 2(a)
that this stabilization may stagnate and even reverse, as
is the case for the (m, n) = (12, 6) mode where γlin(G)
rises brieﬂy around G
0.2 before descending further.
The growth rates reach a minimum around Gmin = 1.0
and increase for G > 1.0 almost linearly with G. When
a smaller velocity gradient (
G/d) is used or the inter-
∝
resonance distance D12 is increased, a larger value is ob-
tained for Gmin (and vice versa).

∼

≈

The frequencies ωlin(G) in Fig. 2(c) undergo a shift
around G
Gmin. For G < Gmin the rotation of the
outer resonance determines the frequency of the mode, as
is typical for DTMs. This indicates that the current drive
dominates in this regime. For G > Gmin the mode fre-
quency equals that of the inner resonance, which is closer
to the location of maximal vorticity. Hence, G = Gmin
is identiﬁed as the transition point between predomi-
nantly current-driven modes and shear-ﬂow-driven iner-
tial modes. With a shear layer closer to the outer reso-
nance there is no frequency shift.

A comparison between the growth rates and the eﬀec-
tive shearing rates in Fig. 2(a) shows that γlin(G) grows
at least as fast as ∆fm. This suggests that some of the
coupling between the resonances, which is important for
DTMs, may pertain for inertial modes. For the (2, 1)
mode we have observed this eﬀect by comparing the re-
sults of the RS conﬁguration with results obtained using
a monotonic q proﬁle with a single qs = 2 resonant sur-
face and otherwise similar conditions: in the former case
(RS) the inertial (2, 1) mode is unstable [cf. Fig. 2(a)],

FIG. 2: (a) Linear growth rate γlin and (b) rotation frequency ωlin/m for the modes (m, n) = (2, 1), (6, 3) and (12, 6), in
dependence of the core rotation parameter G. The eﬀective and speciﬁc shearing rates, ∆fm and ∆f , are plotted as dash-
dotted lines. In (c) spectra of linear growth rates γlin(m) are shown for three cases with d = 0.02: G = 0 stationary, G = 0.75
stabilized, G = 1.5 destabilized. A spectrum obtained with a narrower shear layer is also shown (d = 0.01, G = 0.8).

in the latter case (monotonic q) it is stable. In contrast,
higher-m modes such as (6, 2) and (12, 6) have similar
growth rates in both cases, so there the inter-resonance
coupling does not seem to play a crucial role.

The full spectra of linear growth rates γlin(m) are plot-
ted in Fig. 2(c). Using the same shear layer width as in
Figs. 2(a) and (b) (half width d = 0.02), the spectra are
plotted for three values of G: no shear ﬂow (G = 0),
stabilized (G = 0.75), and destabilized (G = 1.5). The
dominance of high-m modes can be clearly seen. The
DTM spectrum (G = 0) has mpeak = 6 as its fastest
growing mode and the last unstable mode is mmax = 18.
In the stabilized case (G = 0.75) mpeak has decreased
to 4.
In addition, a second branch of weakly unstable
modes is present, with mpeak = 18. For G = 0.75 the
frequencies of modes on both branches are determined
by the rotation of the outer resonance. In the destabi-
lized case (G = 1.5), the modes on the dominant branch
around mpeak = 10 grow rapidly and their frequencies are
up-shifted, implying rotation with the inner resonance.
The growth rates on the secondary branch are almost
the same as for G = 0.75 and the frequencies are still
determined by the rotation of the outer resonance.

In Fig. 2(c) a case with a smaller shear layer width
d = 0.01 is shown as well. Compared to the d = 0.02
case, here inertial modes are destabilized at a smaller
value of G and one ﬁnds higher mpeak = 14 and mmax =
26.
Indeed, it is found that mmax is controlled by the
parameter d, while G is irrelevant. This is similar to
the KHI which possesses an upper threshold for the wave
number kϑ = m/r of unstable modes [1]: kϑd . Ø(1) for
γ > 0. Here, for d = 0.02 and r0 = 0.4 the dominant
branch has mmax = 18 [Fig. 2(c)], so that kϑd = 0.9 . 1.
Modes on the secondary branch do not seem to be subject
to the same threshold.

Calculations with magnetic Reynolds numbers in the

1015 reveal that inertial modes
(G > Gmin) on the dominant branch grow indepen-
dently of SHp. The ideal character of the instability
is reﬂected in the linear eigenmode structures shown in
Fig. 3(a) and (b) for (m, n) = (10, 5): the ﬂux perturba-
tion switches signs at the resonances, as can be inferred
from
π
[Fig. 3(a)]. The potential φ [Fig. 3(b)] is non-zero at the
resonances and its complex phase exhibits a jump at the
inﬂection point of the velocity proﬁle, where u′
z0 = 0.
Resistivity independent modes are also observed with a
single resonant surface and otherwise similar conditions.
The typical structure of modes on the secondary
branch is shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d) for (m, n) = (20, 10).
The perturbation is localized between the shear layer (r0)
and the outer resonance (rs2). At r = rs2, the ﬂux ψ is
non-zero and the potential φ has a discontinuity, sug-
gesting a tearing-type instability. This mode grows most
107, while the growth is reduced for
rapidly for SHp
larger and lower resistivity.

Further calculations show that the growth rates on the
dominant branch do not vary signiﬁcantly when the shear
layer is moved between the resonances. In contrast, in-
stability of the secondary branch requires an optimal dis-
tance
. This indicates that inertial modes have a

non-local character, in the sense that it is not suﬃcient
to the consider values of ωϑ0 at the resonances only.

component and high-m distortions.
In the X-point re-
gions, two poloidally localized KHI-like vortices (only one
shown due to π-periodicity) can be observed, which also
indicates that the originally random phases of high-m
modes have undergone some alignment, dominated by
m = 2. The distortions of the m = 2 islands increase
with time, leading to fragmentation and increasingly tur-
bulent structures. This can be seen in the second snap-
shot in Fig. 4(b). At this time, the ﬂow proﬁle has been
ﬂattened in a wide region, while the ﬂattening of the q
proﬁle is still relatively small. This shows that when re-
sistivity is low, the primary saturation mechanism in the
early nonlinear stage is the ﬂattening of the ﬂow proﬁle.

In summary, we have demonstrated that sheared ﬂows
give rise to a fast growing KH-like ideal MHD instabil-
ity with high mode numbers near qmin in a RS tokamak
conﬁguration. In the nonlinear regime, the instability is
found to transform into a tearing mode when non-ideal
eﬀects are present, and the tendency to develop turbu-
lent structures in the inter-resonance region is demon-
strated. Due to the radial localization of the modes and
the shear layer, and the spatial separation of side-band
resonant surfaces, toroidal coupling between helicities is
not expected to modify the properties of the instabil-
ity studied here. However, further work is required in
order to estimate whether an ITB discharge is vulnera-
ble to such KH-like modes (e.g., suggested in Ref. [4])
or whether other instabilities, such as pressure-driven in-
fernal modes, would dominate. To our knowledge, the
properties of infernal modes have not been studied in the
presence of strongly sheared ﬂows. Note also that since
high m values are involved the MHD picture may be in-
accurate. Our results motivate further investigations us-
ing more realistic models to understand the properties
and eﬀects of KH-like modes in tokamak plasma as well
as certain astrophysical conﬁgurations, such as adjoining
helmet streamers in the solar corona [15].

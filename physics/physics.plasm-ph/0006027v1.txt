We report the observation of plasma oscillations in an ul-
tracold neutral plasma. With this collective mode we probe
the electron density distribution and study the expansion of
the plasma as a function of time. For classical plasma con-
ditions, i.e. weak Coulomb coupling, the expansion is domi-
nated by the pressure of the electron gas and is described by a
hydrodynamic model. Discrepancies between the model and
observations at low temperature and high density may be due
to strong coupling of the electrons.

One of the most interesting features of neutral plasmas
is the rich assortment of collective modes that they sup-
port. The most common of these is the plasma oscillation
[1], in which electrons oscillate around their equilibrium
positions and ions are essentially stationary. This mode
is a valuable probe of ionized gases because the oscillation
frequency depends solely on the electron density.

In an ultracold neutral plasma as reported in [2], the
density is nonuniform and changing in time. A diag-
nostic of the density is thus necessary for a variety of
experiments, such as determination of the three-body re-
combination rate at ultralow temperature [3], and obser-
vation of the eﬀects of strong Coulomb coupling [4] in a
two-component system. A density probe would also aid
in the study of the evolution of a dense gas of cold Ry-
dberg atoms to a plasma [5], which may be an analog of
the Mott insulator-conductor phase transition [6].

In this work we excite plasma oscillations in an ultra-
cold neutral plasma by applying a radio frequency (rf)
electric ﬁeld. The oscillations are used to map the plasma
density distribution and reveal the particle dynamics and
energy ﬂow during the expansion of the ionized gas.

The creation of an ultracold plasma has been described
in [2]. A few million metastable xenon atoms are laser
cooled to approximately 10 µK. The peak density is about
2 × 1010 cm−3 and the spatial distribution of the cloud is
Gaussian with an rms radius σ ≈ 220 µm. These parame-
ters are determined with resonant laser absorption imag-
ing [7]. To produce the plasma, up to 25% of the atoms
are photoionized in a two-photon excitation. Light for
this process is provided by a Ti:sapphire laser at 882 nm
and a pulsed dye laser at 514 nm (10 ns pulse length).
Because of the small electron-ion mass ratio, the result-
ing electrons have an initial kinetic energy (Ee) approxi-
mately equal to the diﬀerence between the photon energy
and the ionization potential. In this study we vary Ee/kB

between 1 and 1000 K. The initial kinetic energy of the
ions varies between 10 µK and 4 mK.

For detection of charged particles, a small DC ﬁeld
(about 1 mV/cm) directs electrons to a single channel
electron multiplier and ions to a multichannel plate de-
tector. The amplitude of the rf ﬁeld that excites plasma
oscillations, F , varies between 0.2 − 20 mV/cm rms. All
electric ﬁelds are applied to the plasma with grids located
above and below the laser-atom interaction region.

In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the frequency of

plasma oscillations is given by fe = (1/2π)pe2ne/ǫ0me

[1]. Here, e is the elementary charge, ne is the electron
density, ǫ0 is the permittivity of vacuum, and me is the
electron mass. This relation is most often derived for an
inﬁnite homogeneous plasma, but it is also valid in our
inhomogeneous system for modes which are localized in
regions of near resonant density. Corrections to fe due
to ﬁnite temperature [8] depend on the wavelength of
the collective oscillation, which is diﬃcult to accurately
estimate. Such corrections are not expected to be large
and will be neglected. We observe plasma oscillations
with frequencies from 1 to 250 MHz. This corresponds
to resonant electron densities, nr, between 1 × 104 cm−3
and 8 × 108 cm−3. The oscillation frequency is sensitive
only to ne, but, as explained in [2], the core of the plasma
is neutral. This implies that plasma oscillations measure
electron and ion densities in this region (ne = ni ≡ n).

Figure 1a shows electron signals from an ultracold neu-
tral plasma created by photoionization at time t = 0.
Some electrons leave the sample and arrive at the de-
tector at about 1 µs, producing the ﬁrst peak in the sig-
nal. The resulting excess positive charge in the plasma
creates a Coulomb potential well that traps the remain-
ing electrons [2].
In the work reported here, typically
90 − 99% of the electrons are trapped. Debye shielding
maintains local neutrality inside a radius re beyond which
the electron density drops to zero on a length scale equal
to λD. The value of re depends on the fraction of elec-
trons that has escaped, and λD is the Debye screening

length, λD = pǫ0kBTe/e2ne, where Te is the electron
>∼ 2σ, and λD ≪ σ.
temperature. For our conditions re
As the plasma expands, the depth of the Coulomb well
decreases, allowing the remaining electrons to leave the
trap. This produces the broad peak at ≈ 25 µs.

In the presence of an rf ﬁeld an additional peak appears
in the electron signal (Fig. 1a). We understand the gen-
eration of this peak as follows: The applied rf ﬁeld excites
plasma oscillations only where the frequency is resonant.
Energy is thus pumped into the plasma in the shell with

1

the appropriate electron density (n = nr). The ampli-
tude of the collective electron motion is much less than
σ, but the acquired energy is collisionally redistributed
among all the electrons within 10 − 1000 ns [9], raising
the electron temperature. This increases the evaporation
rate of electrons out of the Coulomb well, which produces
the plasma oscillation response on the electron signal.

The resonant response at a given time, S(t), is pro-
portional to the number of electrons in the region where
the density equals nr.
If we make a simple local den-
sity approximation and neglect decoherence of the oscil-

lations, S(t) ∝ F 2R d3r n(r, t) δ[n(r, t) − nr]. The width

in time of the observed signal (Fig. 1a) reﬂects the den-
sity distribution of the sample [10]. At early times when
the density is higher than nr almost everywhere, S(t) is
negligibly small. As the cloud expands and the density
decreases, the response grows because the fraction of the
plasma which is in resonance increases. The peak of the
response appears approximately when the average den-
sity, ¯n, becomes resonant with the rf ﬁeld. S(t) vanishes
when the peak density is less than nr.

The resonant response arrives later for lower frequency
(Fig. 1b) as expected because ¯n decreases in time. As-
suming that the plasma density proﬁle remains Gaussian
during the expansion, S(t) can be evaluated and its am-
plitude scales as F 2/nr. In Fig. 1b the data have been
normalized by this factor and the resulting amplitudes
are similar for all conditions.

By equating ¯n to nr when the response peak arrives,
we can plot the average plasma density as a function of
time (Fig. 2). The data are well described by a self similar
0t2)]3/2,
expansion of a Gaussian cloud, ¯n = N/[4π(σ2
where σ0 is the initial rms radius and v0 is the rms radial
velocity at long times. N is determined independently by
counting the number of neutral atoms with and without
photoionization. The extracted values of σ0 are equal to
the size of the initial atom cloud. In such an expansion,
the average kinetic energy per particle is 3mv2

0 + v2

0/2.

Figure 3 shows the dependence of v0 on density and
initial electron energy. We ﬁrst discuss data with Ee ≥
70 K, for which the expansion velocities approximately

follow v0 = pEe/αmi, where mi is the ion mass and

α = 1.7 is a ﬁt parameter. For the plasma to expand
at this rate, the ions must acquire, on average, a veloc-
ity characteristic of the electron energy. This is much
greater than the initial ion thermal velocity. Electron-

ion equipartition of energy would yield v0 = pEe/3mi,

close to the observed value. However, due to the large
electron-ion mass diﬀerence, this thermalization requires
milliseconds [9]. The observed expansion, in contrast, oc-
curs on a time scale of tens of microseconds. One might
expect the expansion to be dominated by the Coulomb
energy arising from the slight charge imbalance of the
plasma, but this energy is about an order of magnitude
less than the observed expansion energy. Also, by Gauss’
law, it would only be important in the expansion of the

2

non-neutral outer shell of the plasma. The oscillation
probe provides information only on the neutral core be-
cause it relies on the presence of electrons.

A hydrodynamic model

[11], which describes the
plasma on length scales larger than λD, shows that the
expansion is driven by the pressure of the electron gas.
The pressure is exerted on the ions by outward-moving
electrons that are stopped and accelerated inward in the
trap. For the hydrodynamic calculation, ions and elec-
trons are treated as ﬂuids with local densities na(r) and
average velocities ua(r) = hva(r)i. Here, a refers to ei-
ther electrons or ions, and h· · ·i denotes a local ensemble
average. Particle and momentum conservation lead to
the momentum balance equations

mana(cid:20) ∂ua

∂t

+ (ua · ∇)ua(cid:21) = −∇(nakBTa) + Rab.

Here nakBTa represents a scalar pressure [11]. The ion
and electron equations are coupled by Rab, which is the
rate of momentum exchange between species a and b.
The exact form of this term is unimportant for this study,
but Rab = −Rba. Plasma hydrodynamic equations typi-
cally have electric and magnetic ﬁeld terms, but applied
and internally generated ﬁelds are negligible when de-
scribing the expansion.

We can make a few simplifying approximations that
are valid before the system has signiﬁcantly expanded.
The directed motion is negligible, so we set ua ≈ 0 ev-
erywhere. Because ne ≈ ni = n, ∂ue/∂t ≈ ∂ui/∂t. Due
to the small electron mass, the rate of increase of aver-
age electron momentum is negligible compared to that
of the ions. The electron momentum balance equation
then yields ∇(nkBTe) ≈ Rei, which describes a balance
between the pressure of the electron gas and collisional
interactions. This is the hydrodynamic depiction of the
trapping of electrons by the ions.

In the ion momentum balance equation, we eliminate
Rie using the electron equation, and we drop the pres-
sure term because the ion thermal motion is negligible.
Thus min∂ui/∂t ≈ −∇(nkBTe), which shows that the
pressure of the electron gas drives the expansion [12].
This result implies that the ions acquire a velocity of or-

der pkBTe/mi, which is in qualitative agreement with

the high Ee data of Fig. 3. To calculate the expansion
velocity more quantitatively, one must consider that as
electrons move in the expanding trap, they perform work
on the ions and cool adiabatically. The thermodynamics
of this process [13] is beyond the scope of this study.

The data in Fig. 3 indicate that about 90 % of the ini-
tial kinetic energy of the electrons is transferred to the
ions’ kinetic energy, 3miv2
0/2 = 3Ee/2α. This does not
imply that the temperature of the ions becomes compara-
ble to Ee/kB in this process. For the ions, ui increases,
but mih|vi − ui|2i, which measures random thermal mo-
tion and thus temperature, is expected to remain small.

This follows from slow ion-electron thermalization [9] and
correlation between position and velocity during the ex-
pansion [14].

We now turn our attention to systems with Ee < 70 K
(Fig. 3). They expand faster than expected from an ex-

trapolation of v0 = pEe/αmi, and thus do not even

qualitatively follow the hydrodynamic model. A relative
measure of the deviation is (miv2
0 − Ee/α)/(Ee/α). Fig-
ure 4 shows that the relative deviation increases with in-
creasing electron Coulomb coupling parameter [4], Γe =
(e2/4πε0 a)/kBTe. Here, a = (4πn/3)−1/3 is the Wigner-
Seitz radius, n is the peak density at t = 0, and the
temperature is calculated by 3kBTe/2 = Ee.

The fact that the relative deviation depends only on
Γe, and that it becomes signiﬁcant as Γe approaches 1,
suggests that we are observing the eﬀects of strong cou-
pling of the electrons [15]. The hydrodynamic model of
>∼ 1, elec-
the plasma is only valid when Γe ≪ 1. When Γe
tron and ion spatial distributions show short range corre-
lated ﬂuctuations that are not accounted for in a smooth
ﬂuid description [16]. Correlations between the ion and
electron positions would provide the excess kinetic en-
ergy observed in the expansion by lowering the potential
energy of the plasma. This satisﬁes overall energy con-
servation and it may also explain the systematically poor
ﬁts of the data for high Γe (See Fig. 2).

Strong coupling is also predicted to alter the relation
for the frequency fe [17], with which we extract the
plasma density, size, and expansion velocity. The trend
of this eﬀect agrees qualitatively with the observed devi-
ation, but knowledge of the wavelength of the collective
oscillation is needed for a quantitative comparison.

Other possible explanations for the deviation are re-
lated to how the ultracold plasma is created. The
10 ns duration of the photoionization pulse is long com-
pared to the time required for electrons to move an in-
terparticle spacing. Photoionization late in the pulse
thus occurs in the presence of free charges, which will
depress the atomic ionization threshold by ∆EIP ≈
2 kBTe{[(3Γe)3/2 + 1]2/3 − 1} [18]. This eﬀect might in-
crease the electron kinetic energy by ∆EIP above what
has been assumed. However, as shown in Fig. 4, the cal-
culated ∆EIP is about an order of magnitude smaller
than the observed eﬀect. The random potential energy
of charged particles when they are created may also yield
a greater electron energy than Ee [19].

High Γe (high density and low temperature) conditions
are desirable for studying the three-body recombination
rate in an ultracold plasma. The theory [20] for this pro-
cess was developed for high temperature, and is expected
to break down in the ultracold regime [3]. Measuring or
setting an upper limit for the recombination rate is not
possible until the dynamics of high Γe systems is un-
derstood. We are currently studying this problem with
molecular dynamics calculations.

We have shown that plasma oscillations are a valuable

probe of the ion and electron density in an ultracold neu-
tral plasma. This tool will facilitate future experimental
studies of this novel system, such as the search for other
collective modes in the plasma and further investigation
of the eﬀects of correlations due to strong coupling.

FIG. 2. Expansion of the plasma for N = 5 × 105
photoionized atoms. The expansion is well described by
0t2)]3/2. Horizontal error bars arise from
¯n = N/[4π(σ2
uncertainty in peak arrival times in data such as Fig. 1b. Un-
certainty in N is negligible in this data set, but is signiﬁcant
for smaller N . The ﬁts are consistently poor at low Ee, as in
the 3.9 K data.

FIG. 3. Expansion velocities, v0, found from ﬁts to data
such as in Fig. 2. The initial average density, ¯n0, varies from

6 × 106 to 2.5 × 109 cm−3. The solid line, v0 = pEe/αmi,

with α = 1.7, is a ﬁt to data with Ee/kB ≥ 70 K. The be-
havior of low Ee data is discussed in the text. Uncertainty
in v0 is typically equal to the size of the symbols. There is a
0.5 K uncertainty in Ee/kB reﬂecting uncertainty in the dye
laser wavelength. Note that for Ee/kB < 70 K, v0 shows a
systematic dependence on ¯n0.

FIG. 1. Electron signals from ultracold plasmas created by
photoionization at t = 0. (a) 3 × 104 atoms are photoionized
and Ee/kB = 540 K. Signals with and without rf ﬁeld are
shown. The rf ﬁeld is applied continuously. (b) 8 × 104 atoms
are photoionized and Ee/kB = 26 K. For each trace, the rf
frequency in MHz is indicated, and the nonresonant response
has been subtracted. The signals have been oﬀset for clarity
and have been normalized by F 2/nr. The resonant response
arrives later for lower frequency, reﬂecting expansion of the
plasma. For 40 MHz, nr = 2.0 × 107 cm−3, and for 5 MHz,
nr = 3.1 × 105 cm−3.

FIG. 4. Excess expansion energy, ∆E = miv2

0 − Ee/α, rel-
ative to Ee/α, as a function of Γe, the Coulomb coupling
parameter for the electrons at t = 0. The solid line results
from equating ∆E to the predicted suppression of the atomic
ionization potential in the plasma. Horizontal error bars arise
from uncertainty in Ee. Vertical error bars reﬂect uncertainty
in both Ee and v0.

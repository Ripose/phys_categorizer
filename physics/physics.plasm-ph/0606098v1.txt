Abstract

The eﬀect of short wavelength quantum electrodynamic (QED) correction on plasma–wave prop-

agation is investigated. The eﬀect on plasma oscillations and on electromagnetic waves in an un-

magnetized as well as a magnetized plasma is investigated. The eﬀects of the short wavelength

QED corrections are most signiﬁcant for plasma oscillations and for extraordinary modes. In par-

ticular, the QED correction allow plasma oscillations to propagate, and the extra-ordinary mode

looses its stop band. The signiﬁcance of our results is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The non–linear properties of the quantum vacuum has become increasingly interesting

(see e.g.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] for some recent examples), in particular due to the rapidly

growing power of present day laser systems [8, 9].

It is expected that already the next

generation laser systems will reach intensities where quantum electrodynamic (QED) eﬀects,

such as electron–positron pair creation and elastic photon–photon scattering, will be directly

observable [10, 11]. These eﬀects may even play an important role in future laser–plasma

experiments [12], e.g., in laser self focusing [13, 14] where laser pulse compression could
give rise to ﬁeld strengths close to the critical ﬁeld strength, Ecrit = m2c3/~e ≈ 1018 V/m,
where m is the electron rest mass, c is the speed of light in vacuum, ~ is Planck’s constant

divided by 2π, and e is the magnitude of the electron charge. Furthermore, in astrophysical

environments highly energetic phenomena may give rise to parameter ranges in which QED

can be inﬂuential. One such example is pulsar magnetospheres [15] and magnetars [16]. In
the latter the magnetic ﬁelds can reach values above 1014 G, thus giving equivalent electric

ﬁelds above the Schwinger limit. Thus, in such highly magnetized environments any plasma

would be one–dimensional and local gamma-ray sources may be proliﬁc.

These QED eﬀects arise due to the intense electromagnetic ﬁeld interacting with the

quantum vacuum. By contrast, in this paper we have chosen to look for linear QED eﬀects

in plasma wave propagation when the intensity is low, but instead the frequency is high

such that short wavelength corrections may be important. The study is carried out for

both plasma oscillations and for electromagnetic waves in an unmagnetized as well as a

magnetized plasma. For high plasma densities or high frequency waves, it is found that the

short wavelength QED corrections can give appreciable corrections to plasma oscillations and

the propagation of extraordinary electromagnetic modes. We discuss possible applications

of the results.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

An eﬀective theory for photon–photon scattering can be formulated trough the

Heisenberg–Euler Lagrangian density [17, 18], which describes a vacuum perturbed with

a constant electromagnetic ﬁeld. It is valid for ﬁeld strengths much lower than the critical

2

ﬁeld strength. By adding a derivative correction term to the Lagrangian density, the eﬀect

of rapid ﬁeld variations can be taken into account [19]. However, since electron-positron

pair creation is not included in this model, the frequencies must still be much lower than
the Compton frequency [12, 20] ωe = mc2/~, and the dispersive and diﬀractive eﬀects must

be small [21]. The Lagrangian density is

We further assume that a high frequency low amplitude ﬁeld is considered, such that

the non–linear coupling can be neglected compared to the dispersive eﬀects, i.e. the terms

containing κ is negligible compared to the terms containing σ. The corresponding Maxwell

equations resulting from the derivative corrected ﬁeld equation then become

III. PLASMA OSCILLATIONS

Because of the simple classical dispersion relation for plasma oscillations, ω2 = ω2

p for a

cold plasma, the dispersive eﬀects due to the QED derivative correction are easy to recognize.

Linearizing Eqs. (2a) and (3)–(5) and Fourier decomposing gives us the dispersion relation

The deviation from the classical result is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is seen that the for small wave

velocity approaches that of the speed of light in vacuum, whereas in the classical case there

would be no propagation at all. However, within this model the QED corrections must
remain small such that the condition ¯σ( ¯K 2 − ¯ω2) ≪ 1 holds.

IV. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE IN AN UNMAGNETIZED PLASMA

Linearizing Eqs. (2b), (2c), (4) and (6) and Fourier analysing, the normalized dispersion

relation is

Using the normalized phase velocity ¯v, where ¯v = ¯ω/ ¯K = vφ/c, where vφ is the phase

velocity, we can write the dispersion relation as

1 + 2¯σ ¯ω2
(cid:0)
which has two distinct solutions. From Fig. 2, it is clearly seen that one of the solutions

gives the classical limit when ¯σ → 0. For small ¯ω, the other root can approximately be
written as ¯v2 ≈ ¯σ ¯ω2 to the lowest non–vanishing order. But ¯v2 = ¯ω2/ ¯K 2, which implies that
¯K 2 ≈ 1/¯σ, and this violates the condition ¯σ( ¯K 2 − ¯ω2) ≪ 1, i.e., the dispersive eﬀects are no

longer small. For this reason, the non–classical root to the dispersion relation is found to be

a non–physical one.

plasma. The dotted line is a non–physical solution to (7). The solid line is the classical dispersion

The eﬀect of the corrections due to a rapidly varying ﬁeld is to dislocate the cut–oﬀ

frequency to a slightly lower frequency. The shift in frequency is very small and does not

become signiﬁcant until ¯σ is much larger than allowed in our model. Thus, we can say that

within this model, an electromagnetic wave in a unmagnetized plasma is virtually unaﬀected

by the short wavelength QED correction.

V. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE, B kk

Next we look at wave propagation parallel to an external magnetic ﬁeld, B0 = B0ˆz, where

the electric ﬁeld is circularly polarized,

E1 = ˜E1(ˆx ± iˆy) exp(ikz − iωt).

Linearizing Eqs. (2b), (2c), (4) and (6) we ﬁnd the normalized dispersion relation to be

¯K 2 − ¯ω2

(cid:1)

where ¯Ω = ωc/ωp, ωc ≡ −eB0/m is the electron gyro frequency and the +(–) sign means a

right hand circularly polarized wave (left hand circularly polarized wave), also called R–wave

(L–wave). The dispersion relation can also be expressed in terms of the normalized phase

In the limit of no magnetic ﬁeld ( ¯Ω → 0), the dispersion relation simply becomes that

of an electromagnetic wave propagating in a unmagnetized plasma, (7), which had a non–

physical root. The corresponding non–physical root has been disregarded in Fig. 3 and Fig.

The eﬀect of the corrections due to a rapidly varying ﬁeld is again to dislocate the cut–oﬀ

frequency of the R-wave and the L–wave to a slightly lower frequency. Even though the

eﬀect is more pronounced for the R-wave than for the L-wave, see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, it is

still very small.

VI. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE, B⊥k (X–WAVE)

We also consider an electromagnetic wave propagating orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld

of a magnetized plasma, such that the electric ﬁeld oscillates orthogonal to the external

magnetic ﬁeld (X–wave). Linearizing Eqs (2b), (2c), (4) and (6) we ﬁnd the normalized

dispersion relation to be

(cid:0)
In the limit of no magnetic ﬁeld ( ¯Ω → 0), the dispersion relation becomes a product of that

(cid:1) (cid:2)

(cid:1)(cid:3)

(cid:0)

for plasma oscillations and that for an electromagnetic wave in a unmagnetized plasma. The

corresponding non–physical root of (8) has been disregarded in Fig. 5.

The solutions of (8) are easily identiﬁed with the two classical ones (solid lines) in Fig. 5.

As can be seen, the high frequency branch does not signiﬁcantly deviate from the classical

one. However, the deviation is more pronounced for the low frequency branch. While it is

not explicitly shown in Fig. 5, it should be noted that the QED induced eﬀects depend only

weakly on the external magnetic ﬁeld. In Fig. 5, this solution has been plotted for diﬀerent

values of the normalized dispersive parameter, ¯σ. It is interesting to note that the short

wavelength correction removes the stop band of the X–wave.

VII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper we have investigated how the short wavelength QED correction aﬀects

plasma wave propagation in both a unmagnetized and a magnetized plasma. In order to

concentrate on the eﬀects associated with the QED corrections, we have chosen to consider

the simple case of a cold plasma. Furthermore, the ﬁeld amplitude is assumed to be small

such that the nonlinear eﬀects can be neglected. The dispersive eﬀects due to the short

wavelength QED correction is found to be small but well pronounced for plasma oscillations,

Fig. 1, and X–waves, Fig. 5, for suﬃciently large wavenumbers, whereas the eﬀect is less

pronounced for parallel propagating R– and L–waves, Fig. 4 and Fig. 3, and electromagnetic
waves in a unmagnetized plasma, Fig. 2. We know that the condition ¯σ( ¯K 2 − ¯ω2) ≪ 1 and
ω ≪ ωe must be satisﬁed, for our model to be applicable, with ¯σ ≈ (1/500)(ω2

e ). For all of

p/ω2

the waves considered above, except for R–waves, we learn from the dispersion diagrams that
ω ≥ ωp always, at least for suﬃciently large wavenumbers ¯K. Thus, for suﬃciently dense

plasmas, we will reach parameter ranges where the dispersive QED eﬀects become large. The

highest plasma densities on earth are found in laser fusion experiments where the density
can reach values as high as n0 ≈ 1028cm−3, giving ωp ≈ 0.01ωe. For such plasma densities,
the dispersive parameter becomes, ¯σ ≈ 2 × 10−7. Detection of these QED corrections must

9

therefore be done in the extreme short wave limit ¯K ≫ 1 or with an extremely high precision.

The phase shift of a laser beam can be measured with extremely high precision through

interferometry [23]. Also, by using a experimental setup consisting of a standing wave in a

plasma, the phase shift at each pass through the plasma can be accumulated, thus enhancing

the total phase shift to be measured. However, to single out the dispersive QED eﬀects from

the general dispersive eﬀects of a plasma requires knowledge of the plasma parameters with

great precision for such an experiment to be conclusive. In this respect the conditions in laser

fusion experiments are not suitable, due to the rapid change of plasma density. For lower

plasma densities, a fairly high stability of the plasma conditions could compensate for the

even smaller value of ¯σ to make a high precision experiment possible. In an experiment, the

plasma parameters may either be determined with independent measuring techniques, but

it might also be possible to extract information about the plasma by measuring the phase

shift for diﬀerent frequencies or polarizations. How to extract this information and how to

construct a scheme to detect the QED short wave corrections is nontrivial and constitutes

a project for future research.

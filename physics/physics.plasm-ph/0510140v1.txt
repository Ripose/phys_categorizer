On the Solvability of Magnetic Diﬀerential
Equations

Abstract
The calculation of both resistive and ideal plasma equilibria amounts to solving a
number of magnetic diﬀerential equations which are of the type ~B · ∇Φ = s. We apply
the necessary and suﬃcient criterion for the existence of the potential Φ and ﬁnd that
a static equilibrium conﬁguration of a magnetically conﬁned plasma does not exist in
axi-symmetric toroidal geometry.

I Introduction
The term ‘magnetic diﬀerential equation’ was coined by Kruskal and Kulsrud [1] in
1958.
It arose from an attempt to model a ‘resistive plasma equilibrium’ with the
equations:

~j × ~B = ∇p
rot ~B = µ0~j
div ~B = 0
~E + ~v × ~B = η ~j
rot ~E = 0

~B · ∇Φ = −η ~j · ~B = s

= 0

From (5) follows ~E = −∇Φ and from (4) after taking the scalar product with ~B:

This equation was called a magnetic diﬀerential equation. Newcomb [2] formulated a
criterion for its solvability in 1959:

where the integration has to be carried out around closed ﬁeld lines.

Equations (1 - 5) are the basis for calculating the classical diﬀusive particle losses in
a magnetically conﬁned plasma. Pﬁrsch and Schl¨uter [3] used a magnetic model ﬁeld
which did not exactly satisfy equations (1 - 2), but they obtained, nevertheless, an
estimate for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in a toroidal conﬁguration. Later on Maschke [4]
generalized their results for a true equilibrium conﬁguration and conﬁrmed the order of
magnitude of the predicted losses. The present state of the art to calculate collisional
transport in tokamaks including the eﬀect of trapped particles can be found, e.g., in
[5].

In this paper we analyze again the solvability of (6) and ﬁnd that Newcomb’s crite-
∇φ · d~l taken around
rion (7) is necessary, but not suﬃcient. In general, the integral
any closed loop, which does not surround the central hole of the torus, must vanish, if
the potential φ is to exist. If we restrict ourselves to axi-symmetric conﬁgurations (e.g.
tokamak), we see that (7) is only applied to a special class of closed loops, namely to
the nested contours of the magnetic surfaces. In Section IV we apply the necessary
and suﬃcient condition (5) on (6) and ﬁnd that the inhomogeneous part s of the mag-
netic diﬀerential equation (6) must vanish. Since s is given by other requirements, the
condition for the existence of the potential cannot be satisﬁed.

H

In Section V we reduce the force balance (1) to a magnetic diﬀerential equation
which is of the same structure as (6). It turns out that the criterion for its solvability
can also not be satisﬁed in general. The reason is that the transformation properties
of the cross-product in (1) are at variance with the transformation properties of the
pressure gradient. As a consequence we come to the conclusion that the assumed
stationary state of a magnetically conﬁned plasma as described by (1 - 5) does not
exist.

II Equilibrium conﬁguration
We introduce a cylindrical coordinate system with unit vectors (~eR, ~eϕ, ~eZ) and take
the toroidal angle as an ignorable coordinate (axi-symmetry). The magnetic ﬁeld
satisfying (3) may be written as:

~B = ~Bp + ~Bϕ = ∇ψ × ∇ϕ +

F
R

~eϕ

where ψ is the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function. From (1) and the poloidal component
of (2) follows then:

also analytical solutions (see Appendix A) which contain free parameters so that the
solution can be adapted to realistic boundary conditions. Recently equation (11) has
been modiﬁed [7] to include approximately the eﬀect of magnetic islands which break
axi-symmetry. At this point, however, we assume that a solution of (11) is given for a
particular choice of p′ and F F ′.

III Standard method for calculating the electric ﬁeld and the velocity ﬁeld
The method used in [3] and [4] for calculating the electric ﬁeld is straightforward.
Because of (5) the electric ﬁeld may be written as:

where U is the loop voltage produced by a transformer. Substituting this into (4) and
taking the scalar product with ~B yields the magnetic diﬀerential equation:

This equation reﬂects Newcomb’s condition (7) and puts a constraint on the choice of
the functions p′ and F ′ to be used in (11).

The velocity ﬁeld is obtained by taking the cross-product of (4) with ~B:

~v = α (R, Z) ~B +

(cid:16)
The arbitrary function α may be expressed by the divergence of the velocity, thus
resulting in a second magnetic diﬀerential equation because of (3):

It appears now that the problem is solved, ﬁrst by prescribing a ﬂux function
satisfying (11) and (15), a divergence of the velocity subject to the constraint (20),
and secondly, by evaluating (14) and (18). The solutions may be substituted into
(12) and (16) to yield the vector ﬁelds ~E and ~v. The integration functions φ0 and
α0 describe an arbitrary rotation in poloidal and toroidal direction. In the following
it is shown that this expectation is not justiﬁed, since (15) and (20) turn out to be
necessary, but not suﬃcient conditions.

IV Application of the necessary and suﬃcient criterion for the existence of
the potential
Before we apply the necessary and suﬃcient condition (5) for the existence of the
potential φ, we write (13) in the form:

Since the lower bound l0 of the integral may be chosen arbitrarily close to the upper
bound l, the integral can be made to vanish so that equation (26) leads to the condition:

f2 (ψ) = −f1 (ψ) = φ′

0 (ψ)

,

s = 0

(27)

as the right-hand-side of (26) is not a function of ψ alone. Result (27) can also be de-
duced from the transformation properties of the electric ﬁeld vector whose components
are given in (25). This is demonstrated in Appendix B.

The local condition (27) is more restrictive than Newcombs integral condition (15),
and it is not compatible with s as given in (21). Hence, we must conclude that the
potential does not exist.

V Magnetic diﬀerential equations and the force balance
In case of the static force balance (1) scalar multiplication with the magnetic ﬁeld
yields the homogeneous magnetic diﬀerential equation:

~B · ∇p = 0

which satisﬁes condition (27) so that an ideal equilibrium with η = 0 should be possi-
ble. The necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of the pressure ‘potential’
~B, which again leads
is, however, that the curl of (1) vanishes:
to an inhomogeneous magnetic diﬀerential equation for the toroidal component of the
current density together with (2):

~j · ∇
(cid:16)
(cid:17)

~B · ∇
(cid:17)

~j =

(cid:16)

As shown in the previous Section, it has only the solution jϕ = R f (ψ) so that the
radial component of the current density must vanish.

This may also be shown by considering the so called ‘force-free’ situation where the

pressure gradient vanishes and (11) becomes:

~Bp · ∇

∆∗ψ = −F F ′ = −g (ψ)

Applying Stokes’s theorem on this equation by integrating the toroidal current density

which can only be satisﬁed for g = F F ′ = 0 in agreement with (27) and (29). We
demonstrate this explicitly in Appendix A by adopting a ‘Soloviev solution’ [8] with
g = const.

In view of this result it becomes doubtful whether the condition p = p (ψ) resulting
from (28) in axi-symmetry deﬁnes a scalar pressure, or, in other words, whether the
cross-product ~j × ~B, which is in principle an antisymmetric second-rank tensor, can
have the same transformation properties as the polar vector ﬁeld ∇p, at least under
certain circumstances.

In order to investigate this question we apply the Laplace operator in Cartesian

coordinates on (28):

It turns out that this expression does not have the transformation properties of a
scalar, in contrast to the ﬁrst two terms in (37). By ‘scalar’ we refer to a quantity

which does not change its value, when it is expressed in diﬀerent coordinate systems
as a function of space: p (~x) = p (~x ′) , ~x ′ = ~x, x′
i = aik xk. The reason for the
‘non-scalar’ property of (39) is that the directed quantity ~l cannot be considered as
a vector ﬁeld which maintains its modulus as a scalar, when it is transformed into a
rotated coordinate system. The inner product of the last term in (39) will, therefore,
depend on the orientation of the coordinate system which would not be the case for
~B, e.g., or for the ﬁrst two terms in (37).
the invariant inner product ∇p ·
Similar remarks apply to the ﬁrst three terms in (39) which resemble the Laplacian
of the pressure, but the second derivatives have coeﬃcients which are all diﬀerent so
that the sum of these terms is not invariant, as compared to the Laplacian of a scalar
ﬁeld. Consequently, equation (39) leads to an incongruity, when it is transformed into
a rotated coordinate system, as it will depend explicitly on the rotational angle.

~B · ∇
(cid:16)
(cid:17)

In order to show this we choose a coordinate system which is rotated around the

y-axis by an angle α:

x = x′ cos α − z′ sin α ,

z = x′ sin α + z′ cos α ,

y = y′

The transformation rules are:

∂

∂
∂x′ − sin α

∂
∂z

= sin α

∂
∂x′ + cos α

∂
∂z′ ,

∂
∂y

=

∂
∂y′

Applying these to (39) one ﬁnds that the transformed expression contains not only the
components of the magnetic ﬁeld and of the pressure gradient in the primed system, but
in addition the rotational angle α. This may be most readily veriﬁed by transforming
the coeﬃcient ly. It should be invariant, since the y-component of the pressure gradient
does not change under the assumed rotation so that the second term in (39) should
be the same in the rotated system. Instead one obtains:

(cid:16)

(42)
where the k′
n are deﬁned as in (37) in terms of primed derivatives of the primed ﬁeld
components. For α = 0 one returns to the expression ly as given in (39). Evidently,
the expression (39) does not transform like a scalar ﬁeld which is only the case when
the pressure itself, as deﬁned by (28) in the form p (ψ), is not a scalar, contrary to
our assumption. In Appendix A we show this explicitly for the pressure as given by a
Soloviev solution.

From the transformation properties of (39), which are a consequence of the hypo-
thetical equation (1), we infer that a static equilibrium conﬁguration does not exist,
since the transformation properties of the vector cross-product are incompatible with
those of the gradient of a scalar pressure.

(40)

(41)

Conclusion
The stationary equilibrium equations (1 - 5) of a magnetically conﬁned plasma may
be formulated in terms of magnetic diﬀerential equations. We have shown that these
equations have ambiguous solutions in axi-symmetry, unless their inhomogeneous part
vanishes. Furthermore, due to the transformation properties of the cross-product ~j× ~B,

it cannot be set equal to the gradient of a scalar pressure. As a consequence, the set
of equations (1 - 5) is not solvable.

The time dependent terms which are omitted in the stationary magneto-hydro-
dynamic model can apparently not be neglected. Consequently, magnetic conﬁnement
of a plasma in toroidal geometry leads inevitably to temporal changes of the pressure
and the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This may not be necessarily a unidirectional temporal
evolution, but turbulent ﬂuctuations could lead to an average ‘quasi-stationary’ state,
which would not be strictly axi-symmetric any longer.

Acknowledgments
The author is grateful to Professor Pﬁrsch who carefully read the manuscript and
spotted an error in Section IV which subsequently was corrected. Professor Schl¨uter
pointed out in discussions that – according to his own analysis of the Vlasov equation
– the static force balance (1) cannot be satisﬁed when an isotropic pressure is assumed.

Inserting the magnetic ﬁeld components as given in (A.2) with a = 0 one ﬁnds that the
double integral over the cross-section of the plasma inside a magnetic surface does not
vanish which requires then g = 0 to satisfy (A.8). This result was already expected
from the condition (27) and the magnetic diﬀerential equation (29).

Soloviev’s solution may help to understand the conclusion following from (42) that
~B · ∇p = 0 does not deﬁne a scalar pressure. When the ﬁrst expression in (A.4) is
integrated, one obtains for the pressure:

p = p0 − µ0 a ψ
(A.9)
Because of ~B = rot ~A the ﬂux function ψ in (8) is related to the toroidal component
of the vector potential: ψ = RAϕ. This expression may be considered as the Z -
component of the vector ﬁeld R ~eR × Aϕ~eϕ. An arbitrary function of a single vector
component does, however, not transform like a scalar ﬁeld. Writing equation (A.9) in
the form:

p = p0 − µ0 aRAϕ = p0 − µ0 a (xAy − y Ax)
(A.10)
and transforming this expression into a coordinate system which is rotated around the
y - axis by an angle α as in Section V:

x = x′ cos α − z′ sin α ,

z = x′ sin α + z′ cos α ,

y = y′

(A.11)

Ax = Ax′ cos α − Az′ sin α , Az = Ax′ sin α + Az′ cos α , Ay = Ay′

one obtains:

p = p0 − µ0 a [(x′Ay′ − y′Az′) cos α + (y′Az′ − z′Ay′) sin α]
This expression contains not only the coordinates and the components of the vector
potential in the primed system, but in addition the rotational angle α. Hence, the
pressure obtained from (A.9) does not transform like a scalar.

Appendix B
The derivation of the condition s = 0 in Section IV rested on a particular choice of
the lower bound of the integral (26). More generally, result (27) follows also from the
vector character of the electric ﬁeld whose components are given in (25) in cylindrical
coordinates. If one formulates equation (21) in spherical coordinates (R = r sin θ , Z =
r cos θ , ϕ = ϕ):

Er Br + Eθ Bθ = s
(B.1)
the method applied in Section IV yields now expressions for the ﬁeld components in
spherical coordinates. Taking the gradient of (B.1) one obtains with (3) and (5) two
magnetic diﬀerential equations for the electric ﬁeld components:

Writing Eθ = (s − Er Br)/Bθ and EZ = (s − ER BR)/BZ one obtains for the modulus
of the electric ﬁeld from (B.3):

If one diﬀerentiates this equation along the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld lines, one obtains
a linear relationship between the integrals I1 and I3:

(B.8)

Because of (25): f1 + I1 = ER/(R BZ) equation (B.8) yields an explicit algebraic
expression for ER as a function of s and the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld components. This

result is not compatible with ER given as an integral in the ﬁrst equation of (25),
unless condition (27) is satisﬁed. In this case follows from (B.6): f 2
2 and
the potential becomes a function of ψ only.

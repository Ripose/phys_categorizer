Abstract

The spectrum of relativistic electron bunches with large energy dispersion is hardly obtainable

with conventional magnetic spectrometers. We present a novel spectroscopic concept, based on

the analysis of the photons generated by Thomson Scattering of a probe laser pulse inpinging with

arbitrary incidence angle onto the electron bunch. The feasibility of a single-pulse spectrometer,

using an energy-calibrated CCD device as detector, is investigated. Numerical simulations per-

formed in conditions typical of a real experiment show the eﬀectiveness and accuracy of the new

method.

Thomson Scattering of intense laser beams from charged particles has attracted a great

interest for a variety of research areas, including particle acceleration [1], laser-plasma inter-

actions [2] [3] [4], plasma fusion [5] [6], X-rays generation [7] and medical diagnostics [8]. In

this letter we investigate the possibilty of using linear Thomson scattering of a laser beam

inpinging at arbitrary incidence angle onto a relativistic electron bunch to design a novel

electron energy spectrometer. The basic idea is to measure the spectral and angular distri-

bution of the scattered laser pulse and use it to infer the energy spectrum of the electrons.

The concept can be in principle applied to a wide class of electron bunches, but it seems

particularly attractive for the study of laser accelerated electrons.

Electron spectroscopy is currently performed with magnetic spectrometers [9], whose

use is practically limited to rather well collimated electron beams, with a moderate energy

spread around a roughly known mean value. The magnetic electron spectroscopy is much

more diﬃcult to apply to electron bunches having a broad band energy spectrum and whose

mean energy and degree of collimation are not well predictable. Such conditions are typical,

for example, of electron bunches produced by laser acceleration of plasma electrons [10]

[11]. In this latter case, when magnetic spectrometers are used, the electron spectrum is

usually obtained with several laser shots, each one devoted to produce a portion of the whole

spectrum, which results in a poor accuracy. As the research on laser acceleration of electrons

is rapidly growing, there is a need of a new class of spectrometers.

The computation of the Thomson scattered photon yield by a bunch of charged particles

is based on a classical electrodynamic approach [12] and, in the case of incoherent scattering,

it can be expressed as an integration of the single electrons spectra [7]:

solid angle and f (x, p, t) is the phase-space statistical distribution of the bunch.

Let us consider a relativistic electron bunch moving in the ’Laboratory’ frame along

to z and intersects the electrons trajectories, thus making them oscillating and irradiating.

In order to obtain a close expression of the photon yield generated by Thomson Scat-

tering of the laser pulse by the electron bunch, we will assume very general assumptions.

First, the number of cycles N0 of the scattered light emission by a single electron is very

large, so that the spectrum of the radiation scattered at a certain angle by the electron is

monocromatic. Second, the angular distribution of the bunch with collimation angle ∆θe

is known (a collimator is introduced or the bunch divergence is monitored e.g. with the

method reported in Ref. [1]). Finally, each population of electrons having the same energy

has a Gaussian density distribution with σL, σT the (energy dependent) longitudinal and

transversal bunch sizes, respectively, and position of the center of the spatial distribution at

t = 0 denoted with ζ.

is in eV and we have assumed θ << 1 and γ >> 1.

In order to present a full simulation of a possible experimental setup, we will focus on

the measure of the spectrum of a relativistic electron bunch produced e.g. by Laser-Plasma

acceleration (say Laser Wake Field Acceleration, LWFA, or Self-Modulated-LWFA) [11][15].

In this framework, an ultraintense laser pulse inpinges onto a plasma and the strong electric

ﬁelds of the wake accelerate a large number of electrons at energies exceeding tens of MeV’s

[10]. Usually the energy spectra of the electron bunches are broad and, in the cases of

acceleration with uncontrolled trapping, an exponentially decreasing distribution is obtained

[7]. Attempts to control the trapping of the accelerated electrons, thus producing electron

buches with low spectral dispersion, are in progress [1] [16].

To face with a realistic electron bunch, we simulated Ne = 6 108 electrons with Gaus-

sian angular distribution Θγ(θe) having divergence ranging from 20mrad at low energies

to 10mrad at large energies. The spatial distribution has transverse and longitudinal size

σT = 20µm, σL = 50µm, respectively. Finally, the energy distribution F (γ) is composed

both by an exponentially decreasing background (whose parameters have been estimated

by experimental data [10]) and a few MeV’s thick Gaussian peak, taking into account the

portion of the bunch (possibly) generated with controlled trapping. The probe pulse prop-

agates against the simulated electron bunch (αL = π), is 1ps long, has energy

= 0.1J and

E

waist size w = 50µm.

The simulation of the detected photon yield is performed with a Monte Carlo method

by using Eq. 1, assuming an acceptance angle of the photon detector (a CCD camera, see

below) of 30mrad and a detection eﬃciency in the range 0.2

1 (see [18]). The angular and

spectral distribution of the

106 detected photons is shown in Fig. 1.

≈

Since the probe and bunch parameters allow the application of the simpliﬁed analysis

−

(see Eq. 7), to analyze the ’experimental’ results by using Eq. 8 we proceed by computing

the deconvolution of the photon yield with the angular distribution of the bunch. The result

of the analysis is shown in Fig. 2.

It is clear that the estimated energy spectrum well

reproduces the simulated one also at large energies, where the eﬀect of the bunch divergence

is signiﬁcant. We note also that the results of the analysis of the sumulated data clearly

show that the electron spectrometer is capable of measuring, in a single shot, the very wide

energy spectrum with a resolution good enough to detect a narrow peak.

5

A possible setup of the spectrometer is shown in Fig. 3. The probe pulse is focused with

an oﬀ-axis parabola and directed with a mirror towards the electron bunch. The Thomson

scattered radiation is detected with an energy calibrated CCD camera working in a single-

photon mode [17]. In order to ensure the acquisition of a large number of photons for each

shot, the CCD camera should have both a large number of pixel and a reasonable high

quantum eﬃciency (QE) at large energies [18].

Finally, we brieﬂy discuss the main sources of uncertainty of the electron spectrometer.

Let (γmin, γM ax) be the range of measure of the electron spectrometer, and ∆E, δ(∆θe) the

uncertainties on the energy of a scattered photon and on the bunch divergence, respectively.

Taking into account Eq. 5, we get

(9)

provided that δ(∆θe) << 1/γM ax. Eq.

(9) shows that the range of measurable energy

spectrum is limited on the low energy side by the energy resolution of the photon detector

and on the high energy side by the error on the beam divergence. Supposing reasonable values

for ∆EExp and δ(∆θe) of 100eV and 0.5mrad (see Ref.

[1]), we obtain that estimation of

the γ factor are avaible within (say) 5 percent error in the very wide band 10

1000. The

−

uncertainty on the amount of electrons having γ ﬁxed depends critically on the experimental

setup. Apart from counting errors, strong error sources are the uncertainty on the spatial

bunch parameters, while errors in the estimations of the laser parameters are usually low.

The main uncertainty can be, in fact, on the envelope of the intersection between the electron

and laser beams, which is described by the functions

,

. We stress immediately that,

H

K

if the experimental environment let the laser pulse counterpropagate against the electron

bunch (αL = π), this error source can be made negligible, provided that the laser waist

is large enough (see Eqq.

(3,7)).

In this case the largest error sources on F (γ) should

realistically be linked to the statistics on the photon counting, so if a single shot electron

spectrometer is wanted, a large number of photons for each shot should be detected, as in

the example just analyzed.

To conclude, we have shown that Thomson Scattering of a laser beam onto a relativistic

electron bunch at non relativistic laser intensities can be used to generate a beam of scattered

photons and that the distribution of the photon yield can be linked to the energy distribution

of the electron bunch.

In the case of probe waist size much higher than the transversal

6

size of the counterpropagating electron beam, a strong simpliﬁcation of the analysis of the

experimental data occurs and a very accurate spectrometer can been implemented.

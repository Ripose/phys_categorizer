Shafranov’s virial theorem implies that nontrivial magnetohydrodynamical equilib-
rium conﬁgurations must be supported by externally supplied currents. Here we extend
the virial theorem to ﬁeld theory, where it relates to Derrick’s scaling argument on soliton
stability. We then employ virial arguments to investigate a realistic ﬁeld theory model
of a two-component plasma, and conclude that stable localized solitons can exist in the
bulk of a ﬁnite density plasma. These solitons entail a nontrivial electric ﬁeld which
implies that purely magnetohydrodynamical arguments are insuﬃcient for describing
stable, nontrivial structures within the bulk of a plasma.

Ideal single ﬂuid magnetohydrodynamics obeys an integral relation which is known
as Shafranov’s virial theorem [1]. It implies that an ideal magnetohydrodynamical sys-
tem can not support nontrivial localized structures. Instead any nontrivial equilibrium
conﬁguration must be maintained by externally supplied currents, a guiding principle in
the design of contemporary magnetic fusion devices.

Ideal magnetohydrodynamics is supposedly adequate for describing the ground state
equilibrium geometry of a plasma. It also provides a starting point for a weak coupling
Bolzmannian transport theory [1]. But as an eﬀective mean ﬁeld theory it lacks the
kind of detailed microscopic information which is needed to properly account for the
electromagnetic interactions between the charged particles within the plasma. For this,
ideal magnetohydrodynamics should be replaced by an appropriate classical ﬁeld theory
of charged particles. With a ﬁrm microscopic basis and established set of rules for
systematic computations, a ﬁeld theory model can provide a rigorous basis for describing
thermal ﬂuctuations and dynamical eﬀects, including transport phenomena and issues
related to plasma stability and conﬁnement.

Here we extend Shafranov’s virial theorem to classical ﬁeld theory where it yields a
variant of Derrick’s scaling argument, widely employed to inspect soliton stability. We
then apply virial arguments to a realistic ﬁeld theory model of plasma. In accordance
with ideal magnetohydrodynamics, we conclude that the ﬁeld theory does not support
localized self-conﬁned plasma conﬁgurations in isolation, in an otherwise empty space.
But when we inspect the ﬁnite density bulk properties of the ﬁeld theoretical plasma, we
ﬁnd that the virial theorem does allow for the existence of stable solitons. These solitons
describe extended collective excitations of charged particles in the otherwise uniform
ﬁnite density environment. Our results are consistent with a recent proposal [2], that
a ﬁnite density ﬁeld theoretical plasma supports stable knotted solitons [3]. Indeed, we
expect that these solitons can be employed to describe a variety of observed phenomena.
For example coronal loops that are present in solar photosphere are natural candidates.
The properties of these solitons may also become attractive in fusion experiments, where
their stability might help in the design of particularly stable magnetic geometries [1].

Shafranov’s virial theorem follows from the properties of the magnetohydrodynam-
ical energy-momentum tensor T µν in the ideal single ﬂuid approximation. Its spatial
components are [1]

T ij = ρvivj + (cid:18)p +

(2)

Here γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats. The ﬂuid variables are the mass density ρ, the
(bulk) ﬂuid velocity vi and the pressure p, and Bi is the magnetic ﬁeld in natural

1

units with µ0 = 1. The plasma evolves according to the Navier-Stokes equation which
follows when we equate the divergence of the energy-momentum tensor with external
dissipative forces. These dissipative forces are present whenever the plasma is in motion,
but cease when the plasma reaches a stable magnetostatic equilibrium conﬁguration that
minimizes the internal energy

E = Z d3x T 00

(3)

Shafranov’s virial theorem follows when we subject (3) to a scale transformation of
the spatial coordinates xi → λxi with λ a constant. For the magnetic ﬁeld we select
Bi(x) → λ2Bi(λx), as customary in Maxwell’s theory. But for the pressure p ideal
magnetohydrodynamics does not supply enough information to determine its behaviour
under a scale transformation. For this we assume that the pressure is subject to the
standard thermodynamic scaling relation of a thermally isolated gas,

pV γ = constant

(4)

This implies that under a scaling p(x) → λ3γp(λx). If we assume that the value λ = 1
corresponds to an actual minimum energy conﬁguration of the energy (3), when viewed
as a function of λ the energy (3) then has an extremum at λ = 1. Consequently

(5)

The magnetic contribution to the pressure is manifestly positive deﬁnite. Furthermore,
(collisionless) kinetic theory relates the pressure p to the kinetic energy of the individual
particles, which is similarly a positive deﬁnite quantity. The integrand in (5) is then pos-
itive deﬁnite, and we conclude that under the present assumptions non-trivial localized
equilibrium conﬁgurations do not exist in ideal magnetohydrodynamics [1].

We have formulated our derivation of Shafranov’s virial theorem so that it relates to
Derrick’s scaling argument in classical ﬁeld theory [4]. For this, we consider a generic
three-dimensional Hamiltonian ﬁeld theory model with classical action

S = Z dtd3x L(ψ) = Z dtd3x {πα ˙ϕα − H[π, ϕ]}

The ﬁelds ψα ∼ (πα, ϕα) are canonical conjugates with Poisson bracket

{πα(x), ϕβ(y)} = δα

β(x − y)

(6)

(7)

Notice that the time derivative in (6) acts asymmetrically. But in the sequel it will be
useful to consider symmetrized quantities, and for this we generalize the time derivative
term by a canonical transformation into

Z dtd3x πα ˙ϕα → Z dtd3x [ a ˙παϕα + (1 − a)πα ˙ϕα ]

(8)

2

where a parametrizes the canonical transformation.

We assume that the Hamiltonian H is a functional of the ﬁelds ψ = (π, ϕ) and their
ﬁrst derivatives only, with no explicit dependence on the space coordinates xi and time
t ≡ x0. We then obtain the energy-momentum tensor directly from Noether’s theorem:
Since there is no explicit dependence on xµ

∂xµ =

and by employing the equations of motion we identify the components of the energy-
momentum tensor with the ensuing four conserved currents

In general (10) fails to be symmetric. But in the following we ﬁnd it useful to consider

where X ρµ
ν has no eﬀect on the dynamics. (Note that if the theory fails to
be Lorentz invariant, in general there will be no symmetry between the momentum ﬂux

i and the energy ﬂux T i
We are interested in a scale transformation of the spatial coordinates xi → λxi,
which sends ψα(x) → λDαψα(λx). Here Dα is the scale dimension of the ﬁeld ψα. By
considering an inﬁnitesimal transformation with λ = 1 + ǫ we ﬁnd for the generator δS

In general the scale dimensions can be arbitrary, and there is no a priori relation between
the diﬀerent Dα. But if the scale transformation is a canonical transformation it must
preserve Poisson brackets, which implies that the scale dimensions of a canonical pair

We are interested in a reﬁnement of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, a microscopic

Here ψe and ψi are (complex) non-relativistic Hartree-type ﬁelds that describe electrons
and ions with masses m and M and electric charges ±e respectively, together with their
electromagnetic interactions. Note that we have realized Maxwell’s theory canonically
so that the electric ﬁeld Ei and spatial gauge ﬁeld Ai form a canonical pair, with the
temporal A0 a Lagrange multiplier that enforces Gauss’ law. Since the time derivative
appears linearly in the charged ﬁelds, the action (17) admits a proper Hamiltonian
interpretation with ψ∗
e,i the canonical conjugates of ψe,i. Notice that for deﬁniteness
we have chosen both charged ﬁelds to be commuting. This should be adequate in the
Bolzmannian limit, relevant in conventional plasma scenarios where the temperature is
suﬃciently high so that bound states (hydrogen atom) are prevented but not high enough
for relativistic corrections to become important. Notice that we have also introduced an
appropriate symmetrization of the form (8) in the time derivative terms of the charged
ﬁelds. Finally, besides the terms that we have displayed in (17) we implicitely assume
the presence of chemical potential terms that ensure overall charge neutrality. However,
fr the present purposes such terms are redundant and willeither remain implicit, or will
be enforced by appropriate boundary conditions.

We propose that the advantage of (17) over ideal magnetohydrodynamics is, that
(17) provides a ﬁrm microscopic basis for systematically computing various properties
of a plasma. For example an appropriate version of the equation of state (4) can be
derived from (17). In particular, (17) yields immediately the standard electromagnetic
many-body Schr¨odinger equation for a gas of electrons and ions.

The energy-momentum tensor T µ

ν can be computed directly from (10). After we
introduce an appropriate symmetrization which ensures manifest gauge invariance, we

We now proceed to inspect the consequences of Shafranov’s virial arguments. For
this we remind that a static minimum energy conﬁguration must be a stationary point of
the energy (3), (18) under any local variation of the ﬁelds. Since the scale transformation
(12), (13) is a non-local variation it does not need to leave the energy intact, unless it also
preserves the pertinent boundary conditions. To determine these boundary conditions,
we consider the plasma in two diﬀerent physical environments:

In the ﬁrst scenario we have an isolated, localized plasma conﬁguration in an other-

wise empty space, with a deﬁnite number of charged particles

Ne + Ni = Z d3x ( ψ∗

e ψe + ψ∗

i ψi )

(25)

Since the canonical scale generator commutes with the individual number operators (24),
the ensuing variation of the ﬁelds is consistent with the boundary condition that the
number of particles remains intact. By a direct computation we then ﬁnd for a static
stationary point of the energy,

0 = δC

(26)

Since the trace of the spatial stress tensor is a sum of positive deﬁnite terms, in analogy
with Shafranov’s virial theorem in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (5) we conclude that
there can not be any nontrivial stationary points. This means that in an otherwise

5

empty space an initially localized plasma conﬁguration can not be conﬁned solely by its
internal electromagnetic interactions. additional interactions such as gravity must be
present. Otherwise the canonical scale transformation dilutes the plasma by expanding
its volume while keeping the number of the charged particles intact, until the collective
behaviour of the plasma becomes replaced by an individual-particle behaviour of the
charged constituents.

The second physical scenario of interest to us describes the bulk properties of a
plasma: We are interested in an initially localized plasma conﬁguration, located within
the bulk of a ﬁnite density plasma background.
In this case the relevant boundary
condition on the charged ﬁelds states, that at large distances their densities approach a
non-vanishing constant value ρ0 which is the density of the uniform background plasma,

|ψe,i |2 r→∞−→ ρ2

0

(27)

The canonical scale transformation assigns a non-trivial scale dimension to the charged
ﬁelds. Consequently it can not leave the asymptotic particle density intact, and fails to
be consistent with the boundary condition (27) unless ρ0 = 0. Instead of the canonical
version of the scale transformation, we need to employ a non-canonical version of (12),
(13) where the scale dimensions of the charged ﬁelds vanish, Dψ = 0. When we perform
the ensuing variation of the ﬁelds in the energy density (18), instead of (26) we ﬁnd

(28)

Now the integrand acquires both positive and negative contributions, which implies that
a virial argument can not exclude the existence of stable ﬁnite energy solitons. Indeed, in
[2] it has been argued that stable knotted solitons are present. These solitons are formed
within the bulk of the plasma, in an environment with an asymptotically constant back-
ground density. A physical example of such an environment is the solar photosphere, the
solitons are natural candidates for describing stable coronal loops. Another, somewhat
more hypothetical example could be the ball lightning, in the background of Earth’s
atmosphere. Such solitons could also become relevant in identifying particularly stable
plasma conﬁgurations in fusion experiments, when the plasma is kept at ﬁnite density
by the boundaries of an appropriate vessel.

We shall now proceed to demonstrate, that the virial theorem (28) is also consistent
with an appropriate canonical scale tranformation. For this we ﬁrst notice that ex-
cluding the kinetic terms, the Lagrangian (17) coincides with that of relativistic scalar
electrodynamics with two ﬂavors of scalar ﬁelds,

Here we have included a Higgs potential V (φ), to ensure a non-vanishing asymptotic

Notice that now the charged ﬁelds are canonically independent variables, a consequence
of Lorentz invariance. The energy-momentum tensor can be computed directly from
(10). With a proper symmetrization it becomes fully symmetric, as it should since the
theory is Lorentz invariant. For the energy density we ﬁnd

so that instead of (23), we ﬁnd that the canonical scale dimensions of the charged scalar
ﬁelds now vanish. As a consequence the canonical scale transformation is consistent with
the relevant boundary condition that in the r → ∞ limit the system approaches a Higgs
vacuum φ2
0. This means that the canonical scale transformation must now
leave the energy of a static stationary point intact which leads to the following virial
theorem

(33)

Since the contribution to the pressure from the charged ﬁelds is negative, the virial
theorem can not exclude stable static solitons.

Finally, we note that even though the static sectors of the two theories (17) and (29)
are very similar, these theories actually have a quite diﬀerent physical content: In the
relativistic case we may consistently set π1 = π2 = Ei = A0 = 0 in the static equations
of motion. This reduces the energy density to a functional form which is manifestly
magnetohydrodynamical (2),

E = Z d3x "|Dkφ1|2 + |D∗

(34)

But since the canonical scaling dimensions of the charged ﬁelds now vanish, the virial
theorem does not exclude the existence of purely magnetic solitons. On the other hand,

7

if in the non-relativistic case (17) we set the electric ﬁeld to vanish, the equations of
motion become inconsistent unless the electron and ion charge densities are everywhere
identical. This leads to a contradiction whenever the Hopf invariant is nontrivial [2],
[3]. Hence solitons with a nontrivial Hopf invariant are necessarily accompanied with
a nontrivial electric ﬁeld.
In particular, this means that their properties can not be
consistently inspected by pure magnetohydrodynamics.

In conclusion, we have extended Shafranov’s virial theorem from ideal magnetohy-
drodynamics to classical ﬁeld theory and related it with Derrick’s scaling argument. We
then employed the virial theorem to inspect soliton stability in a realistic ﬁeld theory
model of a two component plasma. In line with ideal magnetohydrodynamics, a scaling
argument reveals that the ﬁeld theory model does not support stable isolated solitons in
an otherwise empty space. But the virial theorem does allow for the existence of stable
solitons within the bulk of the plasma. These solitons are accompanied by a nontriv-
ial electric ﬁeld, hence they can not be probed by magnetohydrodynamics alone. We
suggest that these solitons are relevant in describing coronal loops in solar photosphere,
maybe even ball lightning in Earth’s atmosphere. They might also become useful in the
design of particularly stable magnetic fusion geometries.

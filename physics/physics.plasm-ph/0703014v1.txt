Abstract

Plasma toroidal metric singularities in helical devices and tokamaks, giving rise to mag-

netic surfaces inside the plasma devices are investigated in two cases.

In the ﬁrst we con-

sider the case of a rotational plasma on an helical device with circular cross-section and

dissipation.

In this case singularities are shown to place a Ricci scalar curvature bound on

the radius of the surface where the Ricci scalar is the contraction of the constant Rieman-

nian curvature tensor of magnetic surfaces. An upper bound on the initial magnetic ﬁeld

in terms of the Ricci scalar is obtained. This last bound may be useful

in the engineer-

ing construction of plasma devices in laboratories. The normal poloidal drift velocity is also

computed.

In the second case a toroidal metric is used to show that there is a relation be-

tween singularities and the type of tearing instabilities considered in the tokamak. Besides, in

this case Ricci collineations and Killing symmetries are computed.The pressure is computed

by applying these constraints to the pressure equations in tokamaks. PACS numbers:

Introduction

Geometrical techniques have been used with great success [1] in Einstein general relavity have

been also used in other important areas of physics, such as plasma structures in tokamaks as

been clear in the seminal book by Mikhailovskii [2] to investigate the tearing and other sort of

instabilities in conﬁned plasmas [3], where the Riemann metric tensor plays a dynamical role

interacting with the magnetic ﬁeld through the magnetohydrodynamical equations (MHD).

Recentely Garcia de Andrade [4] has applied Riemann metric to investigate magnetic ﬂux

tubes in superconducting plasmas. Thiﬀault and Boozer [5] have also applied the methods of

Riemann geometry in the context of chaotic ﬂows and fast dynamos.

In this paper we use

the tools of Riemannian geometry, also used in other branches of physics as general relativity

[6], such as Killing symmetries , Riemann and Ricci [7] collineations , shall be applied here to

generate magnetic nested surfaces in helical devices and tokamaks through the built of Einstein

spaces obtained from Tokamak plasma metric. This work is motivated by the fact that the

magnetic surfaces are severely constrained in tokamaks [3] and Killing symmetries are well

applied every time we have symmetries in the problem as in solutions of Einstein equations

of general relativity. Equilibrium of these surfaces or their instabilities are fundamental in

the constructio of tokamaks and other plasma devices such as stellarators where torsion is

also present. The magnetic surfaces are more easily obtained when symmetries are present.

This is our main motivation to apply the special Riemann geometrical techniques of Killing

symmetries and Ricci collineation to obtain magnetic surfaces formed by Einstein spaces. To

simplify matters we shall consider two usual approximations from plasma physics [3] which are

the small toroidality or inverse aspect ratio ǫ = a
R << 1 where here R represents the external
radius of the torus and a is its internal radius, and the Shafranov displacement ∆′ << 1 as

well. We consider examples of two plasma metrics: The ﬁrst is the metrical of plasma rotation

in tokamaks where plasma dissipation is taken into account. This metric was used for the

ﬁrst time by Tsypin et al [8] to describe dissipative plasmas in the circular cross-section helical

devices such as HELIACS or Drakon (stellarator) [9]. The pressure of the tokamak is obtained

from the tokamak Shafranov shift equation. Constant pressure closed ergodic nested surfaces

in magnetohydrostatics have also been shown by Schief [10] to be generated by solitons. This

2

is another mathematical technique , distinct from ours, is another use ofmathematical theory

to generate of nested magnetic surfaces in plasmas. The paper is organised as follows:

In

section 2 we review the Ricci tensor techniques and Ricci colineations which are not usually

familiar to the plasma physicists. In section 3 we solve the Ricci tensor components from the

plasma metric by considering that nested surfaces are formed by Einstein spaces, where the

Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric.

In section 4 stablishing a geometrical method for

the classiﬁcation of tearing instabilities and solve the Ricci collineation equations to ﬁnd out

the Killing vectors for the dissipative rotational plasma metric.. Conclusions are presented in

section 5.

II Ricci collineations from plasma metrics

Ricci tensor Rik is contructed from the contraction of Riemann tensor Rijkl in terms of the

contravariant components of the metric by the expresion

Rik = gjlRijkl

and the Ricci scalar R by an extra contraction in terms of the metric tensor as R = gijRij.

Let us now compute the Riemann space of constant curvature represented by the Riemann

tensor components

Rijkl = Λ(gikgjl −

gilgjk)

where Λ is a constant which is called de Sitter cosmological constant. Contraction of expression

(II.2) in two non-consecutive indices,otherwise the symmetry of the Riemann curvature tensor

Rijkl =

Rjikl = Rjilk would make them vanish, yields the Einstein space Ricci relation

−

Rik = 2Λgik

The Ricci collineations equations are given by

[∂lRik]ηl + Ril∂kηl + Rkl∂iηl = 0

(II.1)

(II.2)

(II.3)

(II.4)

where ηl are the components of the Killing vector ~η which deﬁnes the symmetries of the

associated space, and ∂l := ∂

∂xl are the components of the partial derivative operator. This

3

equation is obtained from the more elegant deﬁnition in terms of the Lie derivative

LηRik = 0

Lη as

(II.5)

In the next section we shall construct the magnetic surface as plasma metric singularities and

in section IV we solve the Ricci collineation equations in terms of the plasma metric above.

III Rotational Plasmas Metric Singularities in Heli-

cal Devices

Let us now consider the application of the Tsypin et al metric of a rotational toroidal dissipative

plasma tokamak, given by the nonvanishing components

where the coordinates (a, θ, η) are respectively the internal radius of the torus, which is con-

stant on the magnetic surface, and the remaining coordinates are the poloidal and toroidal

angles. The curvature κ of the magnetic axis depends in general of toroidal coordinate, and

the torsion of the magnetic axis is given by τ .

In this paper a great simpliﬁcation would

be possible by considering that the torsion and curvature would be constant. These metric

allowed Tsypin et al [8] to consider ion viscosity in the plasma. Further ahead we shall also

consider the computation of the velocity in terms on the singular metric magnetic surface.

ηt is the toroidal amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld spectrum and ηh is the helical amplitude,

while (m, n) are the poloidal and toroidal modes of the helical magnetic ﬁeld. Here we shall

4

consider that the B0 is constant and that the metric component g23 ∼= 0 due to to torsion
weakness assumption. Constancy of B0 also yields g13 also vanishes , which turns the plasma

helical metric diagonal. Let us now computing the Riemann tensor component

∂2g11
∂x2∂x2 −

∂2g22

which yields for the above metric

R1212 =

πB0

Since we are looking for nested magnetic surfaces which possess constant curvature the helical

metric above must satisfy the relation

which in our case yields

or

equating them results in

By integration one obtains

Rijkl = Λ(gikgjl −

R1212 = Λ(g11g22

R1212 =

Since the curvature component R1212 is the same in both expressions (III.12) and (III.16),

where c1 and c2 are integration constants. Now as usual in general relativity we assume that

a singularity could be obtained either by the equations g11 =

and g22 = 0, as happens as

in Schwarzschild static black hole metric solution of Einstein vacuum ﬁeld equation. This set

of equations can be obtained from the helical metric above by setting φ(a) = 0, which from

(III.17) yields the following second order algebraic equation in the radius a

(III.23)

These equations yields the Ricci scalar as

R = g11R11 + g22R22 = Λ(1 + πB0)φ

(III.24)

since in general in plasma devices the ﬁeld B0 is very strong we can consider that πB2

0 >> B0

which from expressions (III.21) and (III.24) yields an expression which bounds B0 in terms of

the Ricci curvature scalar as

(III.25)

This formula can certainly help in the building of new stellarators and toroidal plasma devices

in general.

IV Magnetic surface singularities in tokamaks and

Ricci collineations

Let us now start by considering the plasma metric given by Zakharov and Shafranov [11] to

investigate the evolution of equilibrium of toroidal plasmas. The components gik (i,k=1,2,3)

and (a, θ, z) as coordinates, of their plasma metric are

g11 = 1

2∆′cosθ + ∆′2

g22 = a2

g33 = (R

∆ + acosθ)2

−

g12 = a∆′sinθ

r = R

∆(a) + acosθ

−

z = asinθ

where z = asinθ and the dash represents derivation with respect to a. In our approximation

the last term in the expression (II.1) may be dropped. The magnetic surface equations are

tori with circular cross-section and equations

We shall consider now just two independent coordinates (x1 = a, x2 = θ) since nested surfaces

are bidimensional in the case of plasmas, Let us now compute the Riemann tensor components

in the linear approximation

Substitution of the plasma metric above into expression (IV.32) yields the expression

R1212 = +

∂2g12
∂x1∂x2 −

∂2g11
∂x2∂x2 −

∂2g22
∂x1∂x1

R1212 = [3∆′cosθ

2]

−

It is easy to show that the components R1313 and R2323 both vanishes within our approx-

imations. At this point we consider that θ is so small that sinθ vanishes and cosθ = 1

this simpliﬁes extremely our metric and turns it into a diagonal metric where g12 = 0 and
gbb = (gbb)−1 (b = 1, 2) and this allows us to compute the components of the Ricci tensor

from the Riemann component. But before that let us compute the use the condition that the

nested surface is an Einstein space to compute the Riemann component again

Since both expressions for the Riemann component R1212 must coincide, equating expressions

(IV.33) and (IV.34) yields an expression for the derivative of the Shafranov shift ∆ as

R1212 = Λa2[1

(IV.36)

which satisﬁes the well-known boundary condition ∆(0) = 0. From these expressions one may

also compute ∆” = 2Λa. An important result in plasma physics is that tearing instabilities
coming from ion or electron currents possess the shift condition ∆′ < 0. This condition would

be clearly fulﬁlled from expression unless the Λ curvature constant would be negative and in
modulus Λa2

1. Note that this situation is very similar to the condition of favorable or

2 <

−

unfavorable curvature for the instabilities in plasmas [3]. The main diﬀerence is that here

we are refereeing to Riemann curvature and not to Frenet curvature of the magnetic lines in

plasmas. This suggests another method to classify geometrically tearing instabilities. Actually,

since has been shown [12] recently that the Riemann tensor in plasmas can be expressed in

terms of the Frenet curvature both methods seems to be equivalent. Now let us compute the

Ricci components R11 and R22 from the component R1212 by tensor contraction with metric

components g11 and g22, which results in the expressions

which in turn yields the expressions

and

and

From equations for i = 1, k = 2 one obtains

Substitution of these derivatives of the Ricci tensor components into the Ricci collineations

equations one obtains the following set of PDE equations

2[2 + ∆′]∂1η1 + η1∆” = 0

(IV.43)

(IV.37)

(IV.38)

(IV.39)

(IV.40)

(IV.41)

(IV.42)

which yields

ηa = [1 + ∆′]

Due to constraint (III.24) the only solution for the equation

[2 + ∆′]∂2η2

(1 + ∆′)∆” = 0

−

−

is η2 = 0.This allows us ﬁnally to write down the Killing vector as

~η = [(1 + ∆′), 0]

the last relation which this vector will have to satisfy gij(ηj)2 = 1 for the modulus of the

Killing vector will allow us to determine ∆ and in turn from expression (III.17) will allow us to

determine the nested surface radius a in terms of the curvature constant Λ. This implies that

or ∆ = 3
10 a, which satisﬁes the well-known boundary condition ∆(0) = 0. Expression (IV.29)
yields that ∆′ > 0 which shows physically that the tearing instability cannot come from ion or

electron currents [2]. Substitution of this result into (III.17) yields

The pressure now is easily computed from the expression given in reference 3

where by using the value of ∆ yields

one notes that a singularity in the pressure decreases as the curvature constant increases which

agrees with the reasoning that [11] curvature tends to stabilize the plasma.

V Conclusions

In conclusion, we have investigated a method of classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of tearing

instability, allowing for example to distinguish between tearing instabilities that comes from

ions and electron currents or not, based on the Riemann curvature constant submanifolds as

nested surfaces in Einstein spaces. The Killing symmetries are shown also to be very useful

in the classiﬁcation of plasma metrics in the same way they were useful in classifying general

relativistic solutions of Einstein’s gravitational equations in four-dimensional spacetime [6].
Since as it is well-known [3] the ∆′ behaves as

1
δW near marginal stability, we must conclude
that there is a relation between the stability δW > 0 or instability δW < 0 and the positive or

negative Riemann curvature of the nested surfaces discussed here. Other interesting examples

of the utility of the is method is the Ricci collineations investigations of the twisted magnetic

ﬂux tubes and the Arnolds metric for the fast dynamo [13, 14, 15]. Though the examples

worked here keep some ressemblance to analog gravity models [16] since our black hole analogy

does not carry much to the metric since the plasma metric we use is a real plasma metric and

not a pseudo-Riemannian plasma metric built from the scalar wave equation.

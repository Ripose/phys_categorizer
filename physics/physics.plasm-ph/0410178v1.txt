Abstract

We present three dimensional ﬂuid simulation results on the temporal evolution and nonlinear

saturation of the magnetic curvature driven Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability. The model set of

coupled nonlinear equations evolve the scalar electric ﬁeld potential φ, plasma density n and the

parallel component of the magnetic vector potential ψ. The simulations have been carried out in

two limits, (i) a low resistivity case in which RT is the only linearly growing mode, and (ii) a high

resistivity case where the drift wave is unstable and for which the magnetic curvature parameter is

set to zero to ensure the absence of the RT growth. Our simulations show nonlinear stabilization in

both these limits. The stabilization mechanism is similar to that observed in earlier two dimensional

simulations, namely the generation of zonal shear ﬂows which decorrelate the radially extended

unstable modes. However the nature of the saturated nonlinear state in the 3d case diﬀers from that

of 2d in some important ways such as by having signiﬁcant levels of power in short scales and by the

presence of electromagnetic ﬂuctuations. Though, in the linear regime the electromagnetic eﬀects

reduce the growth rates, in the nonlinear regime their presence hinders the process of stabilization

by inhibiting the process of zonal ﬂow formation. Thus the parameter regime for which nonlinear

stabilization takes place is considerably reduced in three dimensions.

INTRODUCTION

The magnetic-curvature-driven Rayleigh-Taylor (MCD-RT) model is a useful paradigm

for the study of long wave length nonlinear shear ﬂow patterns such as zonal ﬂows and

streamer structures [1]. These coherent potential patterns are believed to play an important

role in determining the turbulent transport of matter and heat across ﬁeld lines in magneti-

cally conﬁned plasma devices such as tokamaks, stellarators etc. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

In the past few years a large number of investigations have been devoted to the elucidation

of their characteristics and in understanding their contributions towards transport processes

[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

In the tokamak context, theoretical studies have mainly

centered around the drift-wave model or its several variants such as the the ion temperature

gradient (ITG) mode, the electron temperature gradient (ETG) mode [13, 14, 15],etc.

The basic physics underlying the formation of these nonlinear structures is the onset of

a long scale modulational instability arising from the nonlinear parametric interaction

of a large number of short scale ﬂuctuations; this mechanism is in essence common to a

number of earlier model calculations of strong plasma turbulence including that of the

coupled interaction of Langmuir waves and ion-acoustic excitations [16]. In a recent work

[1] the MCD-RT model was used to explore a very fundamental question pertaining to the

formation of these nonlinear patterns, namely what determines the symmetry of the ﬁnal

state - whether one gets zonal ﬂows or streamer formations [1]. The study highlighted the

role of dissipative processes (namely the strength of the dissipation parameters - the ﬂow

viscosity µ and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D) in inﬂuencing the evolutionary path of the system

towards a particular ﬁnal symmetry state. Using extensive numerical simulation data it was

possible to construct a consolidated “phase diagram” in D

µ space which showed that

−

low dissipation favoured the formation of zonal ﬂows leading to saturated stationary states

whereas high dissipation led to formation of radially elongated streamer ﬂow patterns. The

primary impact of the dissipation was on the initial evolution of the short scale ﬂuctuations

and the consequent distribution of their spectral power. High power in the short scales

(due to weak dissipation) at the initial stages led to stronger nonlinear generation of zonal

ﬂows whereas for high dissipation the streamers gained an upper hand and zonal ﬂows

were subdominant. We believe that such a uniﬁed and consolidated approach could be

useful in gaining understanding of the evolution of similar nonlinear structures in tokamak

2

transport models as well. Motivated by such considerations and also keeping in mind the

fact that the RT model in a generic sense can provide valuable insights in a number of other

experimental scenarios (e.g. currentless toroidal devices, ionospheric spread F irregularities

etc.) we extend and further develop explorations on the nonlinear dynamics of this model.

The earlier results reported in [1, 2], were based on two dimensional simulations. In this

paper we report a major extension of this model by making it fully three dimensional and

also by including electromagnetic eﬀects through the contributions of magnetic ﬂuctuations.

In terms of basic physics the extended model now introduces linear and nonlinear coupling

to shear Alfven modes through ﬁnite kk eﬀects so that we now have a set of three coupled

nonlinear equations that evolve the scalar electric ﬁeld potential φ, the plasma density n

and the parallel component of the magnetic vector potential ψ. We also have an additional

dissipation parameter in the form of the resistivity coeﬃcient ηs which makes the drift wave

branch linearly unstable in certain parameter ranges. We continue to explore the same

fundamental issues in this generalized model, namely the existence of saturated nonlinear

states, their characteristics and the factors that inﬂuence their formation. Our approach is

primarily numerical and we present extensive simulation results from our model equations

to provide answers to the above issues. On the question of the existence of saturated states,

past results from numerical explorations of the drift wave and allied models have been

somewhat equivocal and have indicated that electromagnetic eﬀects tend to inhibit zonal

ﬂow development.

In our numerical simulations of the fully electromagnetic RT model

we ﬁnd that saturated states still continue to, exist although in a restricted parameter

domain. Comparison with the earlier two dimensional results show a similarity in the

saturation mechanism, namely through the excitation of zonal ﬂows. However, there are

signiﬁcant diﬀerences in some of the characteristics of the saturated states. Thus the

three dimensional nonlinear states are found to possess a signiﬁcantly higher power level

in short scales as compared to their 2d counterparts. Another signiﬁcant diﬀerence is

that the spatial structures of the potential and density ﬂuctuations do not develop any

functional correlations. In other words, unlike in the 2d case, the density evolution does

not slave itself to the potential evolution. Our ﬁndings on the eﬀect of electromagnetic

ﬂuctuations on RT turbulence are similar to those of drift wave models namely that

they tend to inhibit the formation of zonal ﬂows and thereby to considerably restrict the

parametric domain of nonlinear stabilization. To highlight the role of the third dimension

3

we have also explored a simpliﬁed limit of our model that can be termed as a three

dimensional electrostatic model. In this simpliﬁed model the role of kk and the resistivity

factor ηs are more transparent and we discuss their inﬂuence in the formation dynamics

of the saturated states. In this limit we also demonstrate the stabilizing inﬂuence of the

secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability [17] in controlling the unlimited growth of streamers.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present our generalized model

equations and and discuss its characteristics including its relation to the previous 2d model

equations. We also derive a simpliﬁed limit of two coupled equations representing the three

dimensional electrostatic model. Section III is devoted to delineating the properties of the

linear modes of the model. This is done through numerical and approximate analytic solu-

tions of the appropriate dispersion relations in various limits. This analysis also highlights

the role of the various dissipation parameters and the parallel wavelength in the linear evo-

lution stage of the system. We next present our nonlinear simulation results on the 3d

electrostatic model in section IV and compare and contrast them with past 2d electrostatic

results. The full electromagnetic simulation results of the generalized model are presented

and discussed in section V. The paper ends with a summary of our main results and some

concluding remarks in section VI.

II. MODEL EQUATIONS

The governing equations for the generalized model of the magnetic-curvature-driven

Rayleigh-Taylor instability are derived along similar lines to that adopted for the previ-

ously investigated two dimensional set of equations [1, 2]. We use the ﬂuid equations of

dition viz.

continuity and momentum for the electrons and ions along with the quasi-neutrality con-
−∇kJk. In addition we close the set by the Ohm’s law which is the
parallel component of the electron momentum equation without the electron inertia term.

~J⊥ =

∇⊥ ·

We use a slab representation in which the radial coordinate is represented by x, the poloidal

by y and the toroidal by z. The eﬀect of curvature in equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld is modeled
by a x dependent toroidal ﬁeld ~Beq = B0(1

x/R)ˆz and the radial gradient of the equilib-

rium plasma density is represented by n0(x) = n00exp(

x/Ln). We take the ions to be cold

(Ti = 0) but retain a ﬁnite electron temperature Te. As a result of this the ion drift (ﬂow)

in equilibrium is zero but there is an equilibrium electron diamagnetic drift in the direction

perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. Unlike the 2d model we now retain electromagnetic per-
turbations ( ~B = ~Beq + ˆz

ψ), where the perturbed magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are assumed

to arise only from magnetic ﬁeld line bending perturbations. Thus the vector potential has
only a ˆz component i.e. ~A =

ψˆz. The electric ﬁeld is given by ~E =

φ + (1/c)∂ψ/∂tˆz.

obtain the nonlinear evolution equations. We express the equations in a dimensionless form

by normalizing the various physical quantities as follows. The density is normalized by n00,

the electrostatic potential φ by Te/e, time by Ωi and length by ρs = cs/Ωi. The vector

potential ψ is normalized by B0ρs. Our generalized set of model equations then consist of

the following three coupled equations for the plasma density n, scalar electrostatic potential
φ and the parallel (to the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld ~Beq) component of the vector potential

The model set of Eqs.(1-3) has been derived earlier by Kaw (see [18]). In the present work

we discuss in detail the linear and nonlinear features exhibited by these set of equations.

Comparing Eqs.(1-2) to our earlier 2d model equations, we see that the extended model

has additional linear and nonlinear coupling to the magnetic perturbation. The coupling
coeﬃcient is proportional to V 2

inversely proportional to β) as well as to the spatial

A (i.e.

variation in the parallel direction (i.e. to kk). Equation (3) describes the time evolution of

the magnetic ﬂuctuation and is coupled both to the density and potential ﬂuctuations. In

terms of basic physics the generalized model has an additional collective degree of freedom,

namely the shear Alfven modes and ﬁnite kk eﬀects bring about a linear and nonlinear

coupling between them and the RT and drift modes. We also have an additional dissipation

parameter in the system, namely the resistivity coeﬃcient ηs appearing in the Ohm’s law.

We will discuss the linear properties of the model in greater detail in the next section.

Note that the two dimensional limit can be obtained by putting ∂/∂z

current continues to remain ﬁnite and provides coupling to ﬁnite kz modes in the evolution

We will refer to the above two coupled set of evolution equations (Eqs.(5,6)) as the 3d

electrostatic model. The set of Eqs.(5,6) are considerably simpliﬁed in comparison with

6

Eqs.(1,2,3). They describe the coupling between only two variables, viz. density and the

scalar potential with no electromagnetic eﬀects. However, the inﬂuence of the third dimen-

sion is still present through ∂/∂z for ﬁnite values of the parallel component of the wave

vector kk. Physically, this simpliﬁed limit can be understood as follows. The perpendicular

variation of the Rayleigh Taylor mode produces the charging of magnetic ﬁeld lines via the

polarization drift eﬀect. Finite spatial variation in the parallel direction implies that the

magnetic ﬁeld line is charged diﬀerently at diﬀerent points thereby promoting the ﬂow of a

parallel current. The magnetic ﬁeld associated with this current is responsible for the elec-
tromagnetic perturbations. However, if the resistivity of the plasma is high (ηsV 2

⊥ >> γ

Ak2

the linear growth rate), such a parallel current gets heavily damped, consequently the mag-

netic ﬁeld as well as the creation of the rotational electric ﬁeld ∂ψ/∂t is negligible (and

hence the limit ψ

0). The perturbations are therefore essentially electrostatic in nature

→

in this limit and hence can be considered as an appropriate three dimensional extension

of the earlier 2d electrostatic model. It provides a simple means of carrying out a direct

comparison with the 2d results in the presence of ﬁnite kk and ﬁnite resitivity eﬀects.

In the absence of Vg, the gravitational drift, the 3D electrostatic model Eqs.(5,6) reduces

to the well known Hasegawa Wakatani model [19], studied in great detail for the understand-

ing of electrostatic low frequency plasma turbulence phenomena in three dimensions. Its

2D variants, obtained by replacing z derivative by a single scalar number has also attracted

considerable attention [19].

There is an interesting scaling property displayed by both 3d electrostatic as well as the

generalized 3d electromagnetic equations which we now wish to highlight. The equations

remain invariant under the following scaling transformations:

¯z/a;

z

ηs = a2 ¯ηs;

ψ = a ¯ψ;

(7)

Here a is a scalar scaling factor. These scalings help in establishing equivalence amidst

a wide class of phenomena for which the parameters β, ηs and the typical length scales

along the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld direction are related according to the above mentioned
scaling relations. Note that the transformation leaves kzVA, ψVA and ηsV 2

A invariant.

It

also leaves the total energy (as well as each of the individual components of energy, namely

pressure, kinetic and the magnetic energy) as invariant. Although the ﬁeld ψ gets scaled,

The above dispersion relation contains three basic modes, namely, the drift wave, the

For this mode the electrons act like a two dimensional ﬂuid, under the condition of

ω/kzvth,e > 1. This is the only mode which is unstable (has a ﬁnite growth rate) in the

nondissipative limit. At a ﬁnite value of kzVA this unstable mode gets coupled to the stable

Alfven branch. We show in Fig.1 the variation of the real and imaginary parts of ω as a

function of kzVA. The value of kx = ky = 0.1 has been chosen for the plot. The other

parameters are Vg = 0.036, Vn = 0.8, D = µ = ηs = 0. For small values of kzVA we observe

that the three roots of the cubic equation are essentially obtained by putting the right hand

side of Eq.(9) to be zero. This gives rise to one real root ω = kyVn (arising due to the

balance between the parallel electric ﬁeld and the equilibrium pressure variation along the

bent magnetic ﬁeld lines ), and two complex roots of the Rayleigh Taylor mode. For the

parameters k << 1 (scale lengths longer than ρs) we have (ω = ωr + iωi)

Clearly, for a choice of Vg << Vn the real part of the frequency is much smaller than the

growth rate i.e. ωr << ωi and is negligible as the plot of Fig.1 in the regime of small kzVA

shows. As kzVA increases the right hand side of Eq.(9) cannot be ignored. Figure 1 shows

0 remains close to zero upto

The expression for kzc can thus be determined from Eq.(9) by substituting ω = 0. This gives

kzc = ky

VnVg/VAk⊥

(13)

The critical wavenumber kzc, beyond which the growth rate vanishes, thus increases with

increasing values of Vn, Vg and ky but decreases with increasing values of VA and kx. For

the values chosen for these parameters in Fig.1 we have kzcVA = 0.12. The limit on kz

q

9

for instability is in fact identical to the threshold condition on plasma β encountered in

the context of ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ballooning modes in toroidal devices

like tokamaks.

In the ballooning mode case, one generally seeks the critical value of of

plasma beta ( β = βc), beyond which the instability sets in for a ﬁxed value of the parallel

wavenumber. Here, on the other hand, we have ﬁxed the value of β and are seeking the

threshold condition on kz the parallel wavenumber below which the instability exists. This

has been done keeping in view the identiﬁcation of the linearly unstable modes for the three
dimensional simulations, where a range of kz are present and β = 1/V 2

A would be taken

as a parameter. However, the expression for βc encountered in the context of ballooning
A = βc,
modes can be recovered from Eq.(13) by substituting kzc = 1/qR, ky ∼
VnVg = 1/RLn = 1/Ra, (as the density gradient scale length Ln can be taken typically to be

k⊥, 1/V 2

of the order of minor radius a). These substitutions in Eq.(13) then lead to the well known
expression for the critical value of plasma beta as βc = a/q2R = ǫ/q2, where ǫ is the aspect

ratio.

In the region kz < kzc the curve ωi vs. kz in Fig.1 typically seems to have an elliptical

shape. This can be understood as follows, we know that in this region ωr →
ω2 =

ω2
i . Considering the regions where ωi < kyVn and using Vg << Vn we write the

which is an equation of an ellipse. Interestingly, the dispersion relation simpliﬁes to similar

elliptic form as of Eq.(14) for ωi > kyVn, with the only modiﬁcation that in this case the
term k2

A is multiplied by the factor of (1 + k2

z V 2

⊥).

There are certain other features exhibited by the plot of Fig.1. The only root which has

the ﬁnite real part at kz = 0 is ωr = kyVn, and arises from the decoupled ψ equation in this

limit; at higher kz it approaches the stable shear Alfven branch with ωr = kzVA. This mode

remains stable throughout, the imaginary part of this particular mode remains = 0 in the

entire kz domain. The real part of the both RT branches are zero for kz < kzc; however as

kz is increased beyond kzc, one amongst them asymptotes towards the drift wave dispersion
relation ωr = kyVn/(1 + k2

⊥) and the other approaches the complementary branch of the

shear Alfven mode i.e. ω =

kzVA.

−

We now investigate the eﬀect of dissipation on the frequency as well as on the growth rate

10

of the three modes. In Fig.2 we have plotted the growth rate and the real frequency with

kzVA when the dissipative coeﬃcients µ (subplot (a) and (b)) and ηs (subplot(c) and (d)) are

separately taken to be ﬁnite. A comparison with the corresponding non dissipative case (all

other parameters being identical) of Fig.1, clearly shows that a ﬁnite value of µ does not alter

the real frequency and the threshold condition on kzVA signiﬁcantly. It, however, causes an

overall reduction in growth rate. An entirely diﬀerent and interesting trend is observed with

respect to the dissipative coeﬃcient ηs. As the value of ηs is increased the real frequency

instead of suddenly acquiring a ﬁnite value beyond kzVA = kzcVA, gradually starts deviating
from zero even before kz = kzc to ﬁnally asymptote towards the drift kyVn/(1 + k2

⊥) and

the shear Alfven branch

kzVA at large enough kzVA. The growth rate too unlike the case

−

of ηs = 0 continues to remain ﬁnite even for kz > kzc i.e. the unstable domain of the kz

space gets widened. This happens essentially because of the presence of resistivity driven

modes; viz. the resistive ’g’ and the resistive drift mode. The expenditure of energy in

causing the ﬁeld line bending along the parallel direction (for ω/kzvthe > 1 modes ) leads to

the stabilization of the RT instability for ﬁnite kz. The ﬁeld lines bend due to the parallel

component of the current. In the presence of resistivity the parallel currents gets damped.

This leads to the recovery of instability in the resistive time scales, and is the physical basis

of the excitation of the resistive interchange mode. The resistive drift wave arises in the

regime ω < kzvthe where the n, ϕ relation wants to be Boltzmann like but acquired deviations

because of ﬁnite resistivity eﬀects; the phase diﬀerence between n and vph permits energy

exchange between the waves and the ﬂuid and leads to the resistive drift wave instability.

In Fig.3 we depict the features of resistivity driven branch in more detail. It shows the

plot of real (solid lines) and imaginary (dashed lines) part of the frequency for this branch.

The ideal results ηs = 0 are plotted in subplot(a) (Vg = 0.0364) and subplot(c) (Vg = 0.01) to
be compared with the ﬁnite resistivity ηsV 2

A = 1.6 plots of subplots (b) and (d) respectively.

As mentioned earlier a ﬁnite growth rate beyond kz = kzc is because of the two resistivity

driven modes, namely the resistive interchange mode and the resistive drift wave. The region

where ωi >> ωr has the characteristics of the resistive interchange mode; in the opposite

limit ωr >> ωi it is the resistive drift wave [20]. The ﬁgure also shows that as we reduce

the value of Vg the resistive drift regime gets broadened, (ωr asymptotes to the drift wave

frequency at a lower kz).

In Fig.4 we have isolated the growth rate of the resistive drift mode by choosing Vg =

11

0. One can see from the plots that the growth rate due to this mode vanishes for kz =

0. An analytical expression for the growth rate of this particular mode can be obtained

perturbatively in the small ηs limit as we show below. We look at the dispersion relation

of Eq.(8) in the limit of ﬁnite ηs. We put D = µ = 0 for simpliﬁcation. The dispersion

relation in this case is similar to Eq.(9) but with an additional ηs dependent term, which is

responsible for instability.

The eﬀect of ηs on the drift wave can be seen by taking the limit V 2

Eq.(15).

Considering the term on right hand side as a small correction (possible when ηs is small and

kz is large) the dependence of ηs on ω can be obtained iteratively as

which shows the resistive destabilization of the drift wave branch. The expression obtained

above shows that the growth rate reduces as kz is increased. The small kz limit can be

captured by ignoring ω in the quadratic dispersion relation of Eq.(16) giving

This shows that the growth rate increases with kz indicating γ vs. kz must pass through a

We next look at the linear properties of the simpliﬁed three dimensional electrostatic

model equations (Eq.(5,6)). This model basically contains the Rayleigh Taylor mode and

the drift wave mode, but the coupling to the shear-Alfven branch is absent. The dispersion

the dominant balance is between the two k2
z dependent terms in (19) from which we obtain
the standard drift wave dispersion relation of ω = kyVn/(1 + k2). Retaining the ﬁrst order

correction due to the remaining ηs dependent term we obtain the same expression for the

resistive destabilization as that of Eq.(17).

The role of ηs on the drift wave branch for the general non perturbative case can be gleaned

from the plot of Fig.4 for both the electromagnetic and the simpliﬁed electrostatic models.
The upper subplot for ηsV 2

A = 1.6 clearly shows that the two growth rates obtained from the

two models diﬀer at small kzVA but agree well at large values of kzVA. At small kzVA the

growth rate obtained from the fully electromagnetic dispersion relation is found to be smaller

than the electrostatic case, which basically shows that the addition of electromagnetic eﬀects

cause stabilization. The two growth rates, however, show a similar trend in both cases,

namely, they ﬁrst increase with kz and reach a maximum value and then fall oﬀ with kz.

The decreasing trend with kz is captured by the perturbative expression of Eq.(17), which
is valid when ηs/k2
for large values of ηsV 2

z is small. Furthermore, the lower subplot of the ﬁgure also shows that

A (= 16) the agreement between the two models is excellent over the

entire range of kzVA. This is a further evidence of the fact that the approximations used

in the derivation of the simpliﬁed electrostatic model are very accurate in the limit of large

resistivity. Though the other two modes are essentially damped by the ﬁnite value of ηs,

the resistive destabilization of the drift mode can enhance the growth rate of the coupled

system.

To summarize, linear analysis of the system shows that inclusion of the third dimension

introduces additional unstable modes and the presence of electromagnetic eﬀects brings

about a coupling to shear Alfven modes. It is then of interest to understand the nonlinear

evolution characteristics of these modes and their evolution into possible saturated nonlinear

states. The simpliﬁed electrostatic model can be useful in isolating the physics due to ﬁnite

kz (parallel variation ) from the electromagnetic characteristics. In the next two sections

we present the nonlinear evolution studies of these two models with the help of numerical

simulations.

IV. NONLINEAR SIMULATION RESULTS FOR THE 3D-ELECTROSTATIC

MODEL

We begin by presenting and discussing the results of numerical simulation studies of the

simpliﬁed 3d-electrostatic model represented by Eqs.(5,6). The equations are evolved with

the help of a fully dealiased pseudospectral scheme [1, 2]. Most of the studies have been

carried out with a resolution of 64

64 fourier modes in the three directions. Some

test studies were also carried out with a lower resolution of 64

We ﬁrst investigate the question of the existence of saturated nonlinear states. In our

earlier two dimensional studies it was shown that, even in the absence of any boundary

or initial condition related anisotropy, there are two distinct symmetry states to which the

system goes in the nonlinear state. The system ultimately forms growing streamer structures

which are radially (along x in the slab description) elongated or to poloidally (y direction)

symmetric saturated zonal patterns. For a ﬁxed value of the driving parameters Vn and

Vg, the condensation to these symmetry states was governed by the value of dissipative

coeﬃcients D and µ. We now investigate the role of three dimensional perturbations on the

development of these symmetry patterns. We choose the perpendicular box dimensions as

Lx = Ly = 20πρs; so that there is no boundary related anisotropy in the perpendicular plane.

close to the 2d case in order to study the eﬀects of parallel scales kz and the resistivity

parameter ηs on the formation of nonlinear states. We chose D = µ = 0.1, Vn = 0.8,

Vg = 0.036, a parametric region that corresponds to saturated zonal patterns for the two
dimensional case and have made several simulation runs for diﬀerent values of ηs ( <

and starting with small amplitude random initial perturbations in n and ϕ. The chosen

values of Vn and Vg also correspond to those of the currentless toroidal device BETA on

which several experiments on the MCD-RT have been carried out. For this machine the

Eq.(7) and may also be applied to the spread F - region of the ionosphere, ELM region of

14

tokamaks etc. (for more details please see the last section).

A typical 3d representation of the initial random potential ϕ structure is shown in the

form of a slice plot in Fig.5. These slice plots basically show the pattern of a particular

ﬁeld variable with the help of color (in color plots) or through shading (in gray plots) on

various two dimensional slice planes of the three dimensional space. The appropriate slicing

helps in the three dimensional visualization of the ﬁeld pattern. For instance in the plot of

Fig.5 (and also in all the subsequent slice plots presented in this paper) we have chosen ﬁve
diﬀerent slices of the three dimensional volume of Lx ×
x vs. y plane at z = 0 and z = Lz/2; y vs. z plane at x = Lx/2 and Lx; and x vs. z plane

Lz. The diﬀerent slices are the

Ly ×

at y = 0.

The initial density n ﬁeld has a similiar structure containing many short scales in a

random conﬁguration. For the small amplitudes chosen initially the evolution is primarily

governed by the linear terms. Thus, during the initial linear phase modes having maximal

growth rate acquire the largest amplitudes and dominate the spectrum. Since the maximally

growing modes are the RT modes that have large ky but small kx, we can expect to see, in the

early linear stages of development, the appearance of structures which are elongated along

the x direction. We see clear evidence of such structures in the slice plot for the potential

at t = 30 in Fig.5. As the amplitudes grow, the modes start interacting and one expects the

power to get transferred to linearly stable modes as well. In the present case we see such

a phenenomenon too and ﬁnd the power in potential ϕ ﬁeld nonlinearly cascading towards

long scales. Such a cascade towards long scales is an intrinsic property of the polarization

drift nonlinearity that is present in the evolution equation of ϕ.

We have carried out simulations both for large and small resistivity parameters ηs, and
observe distinct diﬀerence in the two regimes. For large values of ηs, viz. 10−5, nonlinear

saturated zonal symmetry patterns in potential ϕ ﬁeld are seen to form (see Fig.5). However,
10−6 there is no saturation and growing streamer patterns are

when ηs is small = 1.26

×

observed (Fig.5). Thus in three dimensions, as the available phase space of the modes get

enhanced with the addition of ﬁnite kz modes, the resistivity parameter ηs along with D

and µ determine the symmetry pattern of the potential structure in the nonlinear stage.

Fig.6 shows the simulation cases in the parametric space of D vs. 1/ηs for which saturated

states were achieved (by circles) and those for which only growing streamer patterns were

observed by + (plus) signs. This trend is consistent with the fact that at large values of ηs

15

the contribution of the additional linear and nonlinear terms become small in comparison

with other terms and the set of equations tend to reduce to the previous two dimensional

equations. This has been quantitatively illustrated in Fig.7, which shows the plot of the
ratio of growth rate γ with k2

z/ηs as a function of kz for the two values of ηs yielding
saturated zonal (dots) and growing streamers (+ sign). The range of kz shows the permissible

parallel wavenumbers of the simulation after aliasing. It is clear from the plot that when
10−6, there are parallel scales for which the ratio drops below unity (signifying the

ηs = 1.26

×

dominance of the extra three dimensional terms in the evolution equation and consequently
the dynamics being altered signiﬁcantly. On the other hand for large values of ηs = 10−5

there are no parallel scales for which the additional terms dominate, the dynamics thus is

close to the two dimensional scenario yielding saturated structures.

However, there are a few interesting diﬀerences in the composition of the ﬁnal saturated

state for the two and three dimensional cases even though the addtional terms are merely

small perturbative corrections for such numerical runs. In the two dimensional simulations

the density ﬁeld was observed to get slaved to ϕ and it too displayed the formation of long

scale structures with two distinct symmetries. For the three dimensional runs however, we

see, from the plot of Fig.8, that the density ﬁeld continues to be dominated by power in

the short scales. The scatter plots between the density and the potential ﬁelds (see Fig.9)

also does not show any evidence of functional relationships developing between density and
2ϕ too, unlike the previous case, has signiﬁcant power in

potential ﬁelds. The vorticity

∇

short scales (Fig.8) and does not form any functional relationship with the potential ϕ ﬁeld

(see Fig.9).

The non slaving of the density ﬁeld can be understood by realising that due to parallel

variations, additional modes (drift waves etc.) having very diﬀerent linear mode relationship
amidst the two ﬁelds compared to the RT modes get excited (e.g. typically nk ∼
waves, whereas for RT mode the density and potential ﬁelds are essentially out of phase ).

This may hinder the slaving process of density to the potential. Moreover, two dimensional

set of equations conserve the following non dissipative integral invariant

potential ﬁelds. Such a integral relationship is consistent with the possibility of the n ﬁeld

on the two ﬁelds. We have in this case instead:

The dissipation parameter ηs has been retained, as the 3d eﬀects here arise solely from ηs

dependent term. Clearly, since the two ﬁelds do not satisfy any integral relationship in the

3d case, it is not easy for the density ﬁeld to get slaved to ϕ. It thus seems that the non

existence of any integral constraint and the absence of any functional relationship between

n and ϕ along with the fact that the nonlinear evolution of the density ﬁeld is governed

directly by the convective nonlinearity viz. ˆz

ϕ

n which cascades power towards short

× ∇
scales, leads to the predominance of power in short scale ﬂuctuations in n. The polarization

· ∇

nonlinearity inﬂuences the n evolution only indirectly through ϕ.

It should be noted that in the above runs with ﬁnite ηs, the linear phase has two unstable

modes - the RT mode and the drift mode which is made unstable by the resistivity.

In

order to understand the role of the unstable drift wave it is possible to isolate its behaviour

by artiﬁcially turning oﬀ the RT mode. We have carried out such an investigation by

setting Vg = 0 and looking at the nonlinear evolution of the drift modes. The value of the
resistivity parameter was chosen to be ηs = 10−5. Figure 10 shows a comparison of the

growth and evolution of the total energy, the zonal and streamer powers for RT mode and

the resistive drift wave. The slower linear rise can be understood from the lower growth rate

of the resistivity driven drift wave in comparison to the growth rate of the RT mode. It is

interesting to observe that in the ﬁnal saturated regime of the resistive drift case, there is

no dominance of power in the zonal mode as observed in the context of RT. This leads to a

characteristic mixed ﬂow pattern in which one cannot clearly distinguish between the zonal

and streamer symmetries. Such a saturated state of the potential ﬂuctuation at t = 450 is

shown as a slice plot in Fig.11. It is also interesting to observe that for the resistive drift

wave the energy level in ﬁnite kz modes is an order of magnitude higher than that in the

kz = 0 modes.

In all of the above simulations we have avoided introducing any perpendicular anisotropy

associated with boundary and initial conditions. We restricted ourselves to those simulations

for which the perpendicular aspect ratio of the simulation box was unity i.e. Lx = Ly. The

17

simulation volume Lx ×

turbulent excitations. The simulation, however, gets constrained by the choice of box sizes

in a few ways; the longest scale length along a particular direction is determined by the box

length along that direction. In some cases as we would show below, a natural process of

power cascade towards a long scale asymmetric mode can get inhibited by a certain choice

of the aspect ratio of the simulation box size. The unlimited growth of streamers observed

by us earlier for the choice of aspect ratio unity is one such example. It is well known that

a shear ﬂow excites Kelvin - Helmoltz (KH)instability; however, in our simulations carried

out with with Lx = Ly we observe no development of secondary KH instability which could

prevent the unlimited growth of streamers in the parameter domain indicated by the + sign

of the plot in Fig.6. This happens because the essential condition for the excitation of KH

instability on streamer shear ﬂow (with shear scale length of Ly) can never be met within the

restriction of square box size. The KH instability can be excited only when the perturbation

scales (in the orthogonal direction) are longer than the background shear scale length. With

Lx = Ly there can be no such mode to support such a secondary destabilization process of

streamers. By relaxing the constraint of Lx = Ly, and choosing instead Lx > Ly (we chose

Lx = 4Ly) we observe that the unlimited and unphysical growth of streamers is prevented.

two cases, viz. Lx = Ly (solid lines) and Lx = 4Ly (dotted lines). The other parameters for

the two cases are identical. The plot clearly shows that the when the box dimensions are

identical the energy grows indeﬁnitely and there is no saturation. On the other hand when

Lx is chosen to be longer than Ly the energy saturates. This has important implications on

transport. It shows clearly that simulations with those parameters which require Lx > Ly

for saturation; excites ﬂows with radial scale length longer than the ones for which the

instability saturates for Lx = Ly. Since the radial decorrelation step size is essentially

determined by the radial scale length of the structures, it implies that the transport will be

high for the parametric regime (+ sign of Fig.6) which do not saturate for a square box size

(aspect ratio unity).

To summarize, in this section we have shown that similar to the 2d simulations the 3d

electrostatic model too is capable of supporting nonlinear saturated states that are domi-

nated by long scale zonal ﬂow patterns. Here too, even in the absence of any boundary or

18

initial condition related bias, the nonlinear evolution lead to the condensation towards either

saturated zonal ﬂow patterns or growing streamer formations depending on the strength of

the various dissipation parameters. The model has an additional dissipation parameter in

the resistivity coeﬃcient which plays a special and distinctly diﬀerent role than the other

two dissipation parameters in the selection of the ﬁnal stage. The density ﬁeld in the 3d sat-

urated cases show distinct features of short scale dominance and non slaving to the ϕ ﬁeld;

which is distinctly diﬀerent from the 2d results. Furthermore, the resistivity parameter also

leads to the excitation of additional instabilities e.g. resistive interchange and the resistive

drift waves. Simulation studies on the unstable resistive drift wave were also carried out

which show new variety of nonlinear state in which zonal and streamer powers were com-

parable. It was also shown that the parameter regimes for which one obtains unsaturated

streamer patterns could be stabilized by increasing the aspect ratio Lx/Ly from unity. This

basically enables the secondary KH destabilization of the streamer patterns. It was shown

that such cases would be responsible for higher transport.

V. SIMULATION OF THE 3D ELECTROMAGNETIC MODEL

We now turn to the generalized three dimensional model represented by Eqs.(1-3) and

discuss its numerical solutions.

In comparison to the 3d electrostatic case we now have

an additional ﬁeld variable ψ (the magnetic vector potential), whose temporal evolution is

governed by Eq.(3) and which provides additional coupling (linear and nonlinear both) terms

in the evolution equations of the density and potential variables. The coupling coeﬃcient is
proportional to V 2

A (i.e. inversely proportional to β) as well as to the spatial variation in the

parallel direction (i.e. to kk). As mentioned before the inﬂuence of electromagnetic eﬀects

A with the growth rate. When ηsV 2

efects are weak and energy in the magnetic ﬁeld is typically small. This is the limit where

the generalized 3d electromagnetic model is expected to reduce to the 3d electrostatic model
discussed in detail in the last section. The parameter regime of ηsV 2

A << γ to ηsV 2

A of the

order of γ is thus of interest for studying the inﬂuence of electomagnetic eﬀects on the

dynamics.

19

In this section we present results for the case of ηsV 2

A = 1. For this value of ηsV 2
we expect the electromagnetic eﬀects to become signiﬁcant enough so as to inﬂuence the

A

dynamics. Furthermore, this choice is also motivated by the fact that it is the parameter

regime relevant for the currentless toroidal BETA machine at IPR. A detailed parametric
simulation study for ηsV 2

A ranging from << γ to >> γ for the 3d electromagnetic set of

equations are, however, underway and will be presented elsewhere.

We look for saturated states in a square box geometry with (Lx = Ly). The other
parameters are Vg = 0.036, Vn = 0.8, D = µ = 0.1 and 2πVA/Lz = 10−3. The plot in

Fig.13 shows the evolution of the total and the magnetic energy (solid and dashed lines

respectively). The energy is seen to saturate after an initial exponential growth. The

saturated magnetic energy is an order of magnitude smaller than the total energy for this

set of parameter values. Thus the electromagnetic ﬂuctuations are not dominant in this

particular smulation. However, we present a comparison with the electrostatic case to show

that even in this case, though the amplitude of electromagnetic ﬂuctuations are low, their

eﬀect on the nonlinear saturated state is signiﬁcant. The linear growth of energy for both

electromagnetic and electrostatic cases are similar. This is because the value of the maximum

growth rate in both the cases are identical. However, in the nonlinear regime the electrostatic

total energy is smaller due to a mild decay during the later phase. The lower subplot of the

same ﬁgure shows the evolution of intensity of zonal and the streamer modes. The zonal

intensity for both electrostatic and the electromagnetic cases are at identical level. The

intensity of the streamer mode, however, in the electrostatic case is considerably smaller

and exhibits a mild decay similar to what is observed for the total energy. It is interesting

to note that in the electrostatic case even though the total energy in turbulent ﬂuctuations

are small compared to the electromagnetic case, the zonal intensity is identical, i.e. as

a relative fraction, zonal ﬂow intensity is stronger in the electrostatic case. This clearly

implies that it is much easier to generate zonal ﬂows in the electrostatic case, conﬁrming

the prevalent lore that that electromagnetic eﬀects inhibit the zonal ﬂow generation. The

streamer intensity in electromagnetic case being higher also conﬁrms that the stabilization

of the instability in the presence of electromagnetic eﬀects becomes diﬃcult.

In Fig.14 we depict the slice plots for the three ﬁelds viz. n, ϕ and ψ in both the linear as

well as the nonlinear regimes. In both linear and nonlinear regimes we observe considerable

structure in all the three ﬁelds in the z direction, indicating that energy in the ﬁnite kz modes

20

are signiﬁcant. Unlike the clear symmetry breaking nonlinear stages (growing streamers or

saturated zonal depending on the parameter regimes in the D, µ and ηs space) of the 3d

electrostatic RT modes, in the electromagnetic case the ﬂow structures cannot be distinctly

classiﬁed in zonal and streamer patterns. This is also evident from the evolution of zonal

and streamer intensities in the plot of Fig.13. Furthermore, the n and ψ ﬁelds show a

predominance of short structures in comparison to the potential ϕ ﬁeld.

Our simulations also show that similar to 3d electrostatic case, here too the density re-

mains an independent ﬁeld throughout the evolution and does not get slaved to the potential

ﬁeld. In the 3d electrostatic context, this was attributed to the the presence of a variety of

additional modes arising by permitting the three dimensional variation in the system and

also to the loss of integral invariant for the 3d equations. In the electromagnetic case where

there is an increase in the variety of linear modes, (shown in detail in the third section ) it

is even more diﬃcult for the two ﬁelds to develop any functional relationships.

The electromagnetic studies of this section reveal that the features, which were earlier

(with the help of electrostatic studies), attributed to the three dimensionality of the sys-

tem are present in these simulations also, the sytem being three dimensional here as well.

However, additionally we observe that even the presence of a weak electromagnetic energy

considerably opposes the process of nonlinear stabilization.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have studied the extension of a previous two dimensional nonlinear model

evolution equations [1, 2] for the magnetic curvature driven Rayleigh Taylor instability to

three dimensional perturbations. The extended model also incorporates coupling to elec-

tromagnetic ﬂuctuations associated with the magnetic ﬁeld line bending terms through the

parallel component of the Ohm’s law. The objective of the present work has been to inves-

tigate the inﬂuence of three dimensionality and the electromagnetic eﬀects on the nonlinear

state. It was shown that the eﬀects due to three dimensionality can be isolated by consid-

ering a simpliﬁed 3d electrostatic limit. Such a limit is valid when the typical growth rates
are much smaller than the parameter ηsk2

21

Studies on 3d electrostatic model show that the D

µ phase space, which in earlier 2d

−

studies [1] governed the symmetry of nonlinear ﬂow patterns (viz. the transport inhibiting

saturated zonal ﬂows versus the transport enhancing growing streamers) gets extended by the

inclusion of a third dissipative parameter viz. ηs. A comprehensive parametric study reveals

that the resistivity parameter, has an entirely diﬀerent role in pattern selection process.

While smaller values of both D and µ form zonals and their larger values streamers, it

is the opposite for ηs. In 2d simulations it was observed that the density ﬁeld ultimately

develops a functional relationship with potential. The power cascade towards long scale for

the potential in 2d case ultimately also forces the density to acquire long scale structures. It

was observed in our current 3d simulations that the density was not in any way constrained

to follow the potential ﬁeld. Hence, in the 3d case the density ﬁeld continues to have power in

short scale ﬂuctuations. Another feature of the 3d model, in contrast to 2d, is the existence

of additional resistivity driven modes. Nonlinear studies on resistively destabilized drift

wave (with RT growth switched oﬀ) yielded a novel variety of saturated states which have

neither zonal nor streamer symmetries; instead the intensities of both zonal and streamer

ﬂows were at comparable level.

The electromagnetic eﬀects on RT were studied by simulating the fully 3d electromag-

netic set of equations. At the moment we have carried out investigations only for those

parameters for which the electromagnetic eﬀects are weak and the magnetic energy is an
order of magnitude smaller than the total energy. This was achieved by choosing ηsV 2

A = 1,

which is still larger than the maximum growth rate γmax = 0.16. These simulations clearly

show that even though the electromagnetic energy is weak, its presence inhibits the zonal

formation leading to a relatively higher amplitude of streamers. Thus, as expected, the

presence of electromagnetic eﬀects hinders the saturation process.

Curvature or gravity driven RT modes are important in many magnetized plasma prob-

lems. They were extensively studied experimentally in the toroidal currentless plasma ma-

chine BETA [21]. As stated in the text, the parameters of BETA were such (Vn = 0.8,

cause of the higher value chosen for Vn. Gravity driven RT modes are also relevant to the

It should be pointed out here that several three dimensional numerical studies on the

electrostatic [22, 23] and electromagnetic [24, 25] nonlinear equations describing the coupling

of drift ballooning modes have been carried out in the last decade or so. Such studies have

employed a realistic three dimensional model for tokamaks with eﬀects due to magnetic shear

and parallel ﬂows. These studies contain extensive details of simulation studies on transport

in tokamaks. Our objective in contrast has been to delineate the parameter regime for the

formation of transport inhibiting and transport enhancing structures and identiﬁcation of

the rudimentary physics with the choice of a simpliﬁed model ( that of drift - Rayliegh

Taylor coupling, in the absence of both parallel ﬂow and magnetic shear).

Finally, we make some remarks on the further exploration of the present work that we

are currently pursuing. The complete parametric study for the fully 3d electromagnetic case

has not been presented here. Future studies will explore other regions of parameter space
(especially lower values of ηsV 2

A where electromagnetic eﬀects become more important). Thus
future investigations will be carried out to understand the nonlinear stabilization process by
the zonal ﬂow formation as the the parameters ηsV 2

A are varied. We also want

A and β = 1/V 2

to include the ﬁnite Ti eﬀects, bacuse ﬁnite ion Larmor radius stabilization is an important

linear mechanism of the stabilization of the curvature driven instabilities.

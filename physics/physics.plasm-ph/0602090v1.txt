Abstract
Using Hall-MHD theory, we focus on the resonant interaction between three kinetic Alfv´en waves. We

thus derive three coupled equations which govern this process. It turns out that these equations contain

the same coupling coeﬃcient, directly showing that they satisfy the Manley-Rowe relations. The coupling

coeﬃcient can be written in a comparatively very simple form, that has not been deduced before. The decay

rate, when a pump kinetic Alfv´en wave decays into two similar Alfv´en waves, is therefore easily estimated

for plasmas of astrophysical interest.

The Alfv´en wave [1] has applications in most subﬁelds of plasma physics. Its linear properties has
thus been considered in numerous works (e.g. [2, 3, 4]). Large amplitude circularly polarized waves
z have also been studied during several decades (e.g.
propagating along the external magnetic ﬁeld B0
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) whereas nonlinear Alfv´en waves propagating in other directions have only been
b
considered comparatively recently (e.g. [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]).
Of special interest is the kinetic Alfv´en wave, which can exist when the plasma beta is larger than
the electron to ion mass ratio me/mi. Its frequency ω is

It has been shown that kinetic Alfv´en waves can appear in plasmas, for example in the ionosphere
[11, 12, 13, 14]). The theoretical results (e.g.
and magnetosphere, in the form of vortices (e.g.
[13]) have been conﬁrmed in space-borne observations by means of the Intercosmos-Bulgarian-1300
and Aureol-3 satellites [27, 28], and the Cluster satellites [29] with in situ simultaneous multi-point
measurements [27, 29], as well as by the all-sky camera ionospheric data [28]. The theoretical
predictions and estimates turned out to be in good agreement with the subsequent observations (e.g.
[27, 28, 29]).

It is however necessary to continue our studies of nonlinear Alfv´en waves (e.g. other kinds of
solitary structures [23]), three-wave decay mechanisms (e.g.
[17, 24, 26, 30]) to have the necessary
prerequisites for forthcoming investigations of other plasmas, in particular for the solar corona (e.g.
[31, 32]) . That is the reason why, in the present paper, we are going to use the Hall-MHD equations
to deduce the coupling coeﬃcients for the interaction of three kinetic Alfv´en waves.

The Hall-MHD equations can be written as

where d/dt = ∂/∂t + v · ∇ , e is the ion charge, whereas ρ, v, and B are the density, velocity and
magnetic ﬁeld, respectively.

vgj is the group velocity of wave j, and cA = (B0/µ0ρ0)1/2 . The derivation of (7) and (8) is
straightforward [33]. Our result has the advantage that the same coupling coeﬃcient C appears in
both (7) and (8). This means that the growth rates for ωj > 0 will always be positive, as ωj∂Dj/∂ωj >
0. We could alternatively have used, instead of ρj, the velocity magnitudes (vj = ρjωj |Kj| /k2
j⊥ρ0),
which are more convenient for the case where the waves are almost transverse.. For the particular
case of kinetic Alfv´en waves, in the limit ω ≪ ωci, kz ≪ k⊥, (11) can be approximated by

The present paper considers the decay of a pump kinetic Alfv´en wave (ω3, k3) into two other
kinetic Alfv´en waves. Within Hall-MHD theory, the growth rate of the latter waves then turned out
to be of the order of (k⊥v3/ωci)ω3. It should however be stressed that there are limitations on the
validity of this estimate. For example, we have here only considered a medium beta plasma with
me/mi ≪ c2
A ≪ 1, and adopted the Hall-MHD model. We note that our result for the coupling
strength does not coincide with that of Ref. [17] or Ref. [26]. However, this is to be expected as we
are considering the regime kzcA/ωci ≫ k⊥c/ωpe, where ωpe is the electron plasma frequency, whereas
previous authors have considered other regimes.
In any case, the nonlinear excitation of kinetic
Alfv´en waves can accelerate oxygen ions in the solar corona at heights of a few solar radii [24], and
also contribute to the cross-ﬁeld energization in the auroral zones of the Earth´s magnetosphere.

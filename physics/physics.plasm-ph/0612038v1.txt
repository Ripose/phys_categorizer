The time evolution of a large-amplitude electromagnetic (EM) wave injected vertically into the
overhead ionosphere is studied numerically. The EM wave has a carrier frequency of 5 MHz and
is modulated as a Gaussian pulse with a width of ca 0.1 milliseconds and a vacuum amplitude of
1.5 V/m. The pulse is propagated through the neutral atmosphere to the critical points of the
magnetosphere where the ordinary (O) and extraordinary (X) modes are reﬂected, and back to the
neutral atmosphere. We observe mode conversion of the O mode to electrostatic waves, as well as
harmonic generation at the turning points of both the X and O modes, where their amplitudes rise
to several times the original ones. The study has relevance for ionospheric interaction experiments
in combination with ground-based and satellite or rocket observations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Since many decades, remote sensing techniques are
used for probing the electrodynamic properties of the
Earth’s ionospheric layer. Pulsed electromagnetic (EM)
waves of diﬀerent frequencies injected into the overhead
ionosphere are regularly used in ionosondes to obtain in-
formation about density proﬁles and drift velocities of the
plasma [Reinisch et al., 1995]. In 1971, it was shown the-
oretically by Perkins and Kaw [1971] that strong HF ra-
dio beams injected into the overhead ionosphere could ex-
cite weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the iono-
spheric plasma of the type predicted by Silin [1965] and
Dubois and Goldman [1965]. Soon thereafter this pre-
diction was conﬁrmed in experiments on the interaction
between powerful HF radio beams and the ionospheric
plasma, performed at Arecibo using a scatter radar diag-
nostic technique [Wong and Taylor, 1971; Carlson et al.,
1972]. Theoretical and experimental work of stimulated
Brillouin scattering involved also the EISCAT and Jica-
marca facilities [Larsson et al., 1976; Fejer, 1977; Dysthe
et al., 1977; Fejer et al., 1978].

Ten years after this conﬁrmation of HF-induced weak
electrostatic turbulence in the ionosphoere, it was ob-
served experimentally in Tromsø that under similar ex-
perimental conditions as in Arecibo, strong, systematic,
structured, wide-band secondary HF radiation escapes
from the interaction region [Thid´e et al., 1982], a phe-
nomenon termed Stimulated Electromagnetic Emission
(SEE). This observation demonstrated that more com-
plex interactions than those observed in radar scatter
studies, including weak and strong electromagnetic tur-
bulence, are excited in these experiments [Thid´e et al.,
1983; Stubbe et al., 1984; Thid´e, 1990; Leyser, 2001]. By
varying the injected HF beam systematically in terms of
frequency, intensity, and duty cycle and analyzing the
secondary radiation, and hence the associated HF radio
beam-excited ionospheric plasma turbulence and wave

conversion processes, it has been possible to study the
competition between the eﬀects due to ponderomotive
parametric instabilities (PPI) and those due to thermal
parametric instabilities (TPI) [Stenﬂo,1990; Thid´e et al.,
2005 ]. The heating of electrons also lead to optic emis-
sions, or airglow, from the upper hybrid layer when the
frequency of the transmitter is close to that of one of the
electron cyclotron harmonics [Djuth et al., 2005; Gus-
tavsson et al., 2006]. To understand the complex be-
havior of plasma turbulence, numerical simulations have
become an important tool. Numerical studies have been
performed of upper-hybrid/lower hybrid turbulence in a
plasma having magnetic ﬁeld [Lin and Lin, 1981] and
density gradients [Goodman et al., 1994], and indicate
that possible mechanisms for the broad upshifted maxi-
mum involve a four-wave decay and non-Maxwellian elec-
trons [Hussein et al., 1998; Xi, 2004].

In this Letter, we present a full-scale simulation study
of the propagation of a high-frequency EM wave into the
ionosphere, with ionospheric parameters typical for the
high-latitude EISCAT Heating facility in Tromsø, Nor-
way. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst simulation in-
volving realistic scale sizes of the ionosphere and the
wavelength of the EM waves. Such simulations, which
are possible with today’s computers, may become a pow-
erful tool to study HF-induced ionospheric turbulence
and secondary radiation on a quantitative level for direct
comparisons with experimental data.

II. MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND
NUMERICAL SETUP

Our simulation model and initial conditions are as fol-
lows. We assume a vertically stratiﬁed ion number den-
sity proﬁle ni0(z) with a constant geomagnetic ﬁeld B0
directed obliquely to the density gradient. The EM wave
is assumed to be injected vertically into the ionosphere,

2

with respect to time; hence we do not show Bz in the ﬁg-
ures. The geomagnetic ﬁeld is set to B0 = 4.8 × 10−5
Tesla, corresponding to and electron cyclotron frequency
of 1.4 MHz, directed downward and tilted in the xz-plane
with an angle of 13 degrees (0.227 rad) to the z-axis, i.e.,
B0 = (B0x, B0y, B0z) = (sin 0.227, 0, − cos 0.227)B0. In
our numerical simulation, we use 105 spatial grid points
to resolve the plasma for 0 ≤ z ≤ 400 km. The spa-
tial derivatives are approximated with centered second-
order diﬀerence approximations, and the time-stepping
is performed with a leap-frog scheme with a time step of
∆t = 8 × 10−9 s.

FIG. 1: The ion density proﬁle, and the electric and magnetic

The number density proﬁle of the immobile ions,
ni0(z) = 0.5×1012 exp[−(z−3×105)2/109] is shown in the
leftmost panel of Fig. 1. In the initial conditions, we use
a linearly polarized EM pulse where the carrier wave has
the wavelength λ = 60 m (wavenumber k = 0.1047 m−1)
corresponding to a carrier frequency of f0 = 5 MHz
(ω0 = 31 × 106 s−1). It is amplitude modulated in the
form of a Gaussian pulse with a maximum amplitude of
1.5 V/m, with the x-component of the electric ﬁeld set
to Ex = 1.5 exp[−(z − 5 × 104)2/108] sin(0.1047z) and the
y component of the magnetic ﬁeld set to By = Ex/c at
t = 0. The other electric and magnetic ﬁeld components
are set to zero; see the electric and magnetic ﬁeld compo-
nents in Fig. 1. It follows from Eq. (1) that Bz is constant

FIG. 2: The ion density proﬁle, and the electric and magnetic
ﬁeld components at time t = 0.720 ms.

In the simulation, the EM pulse propagates without
changing shape through the neutral atmosphere, but is
strongly modiﬁed as it reaches the ionospheric layer. At
time t = 0.720 ms, shown in Fig. 2, the EM pulse has
reached the lower part of the ionosphere. The initially
linearly polarized EM wave undergoes Faraday rotation
due to the diﬀerent dispersion properties of the O and
X modes in the magnetized plasma, and the Ey and Bx
components are excited. At t = 0.886 ms, the EM wave
has reached the turning points of the X and O modes,
the turning point of the O mode being at a higher alti-
tude than the one of the X mode; see Fig. 3. A closeup
of this region, displayed in Fig. 4, shows that the ﬁrst
maximum of the X mode is at z ≈ 270.5 km, and the
one of the O mode is at z ≈ 277 km. The maximum
amplitude of the X mode is ca 3 V/m while that of the
O mode is ca 10 V/m. The electric ﬁeld components of
the O mode, which at this stage are concentrated into
one single unmodulated pulse with a width of ca 200 m,
are primarily directed along the geomagnetic ﬁeld lines,
and hence only the Ez and Ex components are excited,

FIG. 4: The ion density proﬁle and the electric and magnetic
ﬁeld components at time t = 0.886 ms (closeup of Fig. 3). We
see that the wave-energy of the O mode is concentrated in to
one single half-wave envelop at z ≈ 277 km, while the turning
point of the less localized X mode is at z ≈ 270.5 km.

X and O mode oscillations have widened in space, and
the EM wave has started turning back towards lower al-
titudes.
In the closeup of the EM wave in Fig. 6, one
sees that the O mode oscillations at z ≈ 277 km are
now radiating EM waves with signiﬁcant magnetic ﬁeld
components. Finally, shown in Fig. 7 at t = 1.752, the
EM pulse has returned to the initial location at z = 50
km. Due to the diﬀerent reﬂection heights of the O and
X modes, the heading (lower altitude) part of the pulse
is primarily X mode polarized while its trailing (higher

Here, the O mode oscillations at z ≈ 277 are radiating EM
waves with perpendicular (to the z axis) electric ﬁeld compo-
nents.

In Fig. 8, we have plotted the electric ﬁeld component
Ez at z = 276.82 km, which is near the turning point of
the O mode, and the Ex component of the electric ﬁeld
at z = 270.50 km, near the turning point of the X mode.
At z = 276.82 km (upper panel), we see the maximum

Ex ≈ 3 V/m at t = 0.87 ms. The electric ﬁeld amplitude
at z = 270.50 km has two maxima, due to the O mode
part of the pulse, which is reﬂected at the higher altitude
z = 276.82 km and passes twice over the altitude z =

at z = 276.82 km for times t > 1.05 ms, which decrease
exponentially in time between t = 1.1 ms and t = 1.5
ms as Ez ∝ exp(−γt) with γ = 6.5 × 103 s−1 = 2.1 ×
10−4 ω0. No detectable magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are
associated with these weakly damped oscillations, and
we interpret them as electrostatic waves that have been
mode converted by the reﬂected O mode.

the relatively weak second harmonics of the pump wave
at the frequency 10 MHz at both altitudes (the slight
downshift is due to numerical dispersion errors). Visible
are also low-frequency oscillations (zeroth harmonic) due
to the nonlinear self-interaction of the EM waves.

In conclusion, we have presented a full-scale numer-
ical study of the propagation of an EM wave and its
linear and nonlinear interactions with an ionospheric
layer. We could observe the reﬂection of the ordinary (O)
and extraordinary (X) modes at diﬀerent altitudes, the
mode conversion of the O mode into electrostatic Lang-
muir/upper hybrid waves as well as nonlinear harmonic
generation of the high-frequency waves. Future stud-
ies will involve electron thermal and kinetic eﬀects, and
will address the nonlinear dynamics between electrons
and ions on diﬀerent timescales, observed in experiments
[Thid´e et al., 2005].

Beatwave Excitation of Plasma Waves Based on Relativistic Bi-Stability

A nonlinear beatwave regime of plasma wave excitation is considered. Two beatwave drivers are
considered: intensity-modulated laser pulse and density-modulated (microbunched) electron beam.
It is shown that a long beatwave pulse can excite strong plasma waves in its wake even when
the beatwave frequency is detuned from the electron plasma frequency. The wake is caused by the
dynamic bi-stability of the nonlinear plasma wave if the beatwave amplitude exceeds the analytically
calculated threshold. In the context of a microbunched beam driven plasma wakeﬁeld accelerator,
this excitation regime can be applied to developing a femtosecond electron injector.

Beatwave excitation of electron plasma waves continues attracting signiﬁcant attention as a basic nonlinear plasma
phenomenon, and as a viable approach to plasma-based particle acceleration [1, 2, 3, 4]. Beatwave excitation mech-
anism is realized when the driver intensity (laser or particle beam) is modulated with the temporal periodicity
of the plasma wave. The linear one-dimensional theory of the beatwave-driven plasma wave generation is well
understood [1, 5], and its most important predictions are as follows. First, the eﬀectiveness of plasma wave ex-
citation is strongly dependent on the diﬀerence between the beatwave frequency ωB and plasma wave frequency
ωp =
e and m are the electron charge and mass, and n0 is the plasma density): the smaller is
−
the frequency detuning ∆ω
ωp, the larger is the resulting plasma wave inside the beatwave. Second, only if
the beatwave pulse is short enough for its bandwidth to be comparable to ∆ω, an appreciable plasma wave is left in
its wake.

In this Letter I demonstrate that these conclusions are no longer valid when the relativistic nonlinearity of a plasma
wave is accounted for. In particular, a strong plasma wave can be excited in the wake of a relatively long beatwave
1/∆ω due to the nonlinear phenomenon of dynamic relativistic bi-stability (RB) [6]. Another
pulse of duration tL ≫
manifestation of RB is that, at a certain critical strength of the beatwave driver, a weak driven plasma wave becomes
unstable, and a much higher amplitude wave is excited. Linear estimates of the plasma wave amplitude fail when
the beatwave amplitude exceeds this detuning-dependent critical strength. As the time-dependent beatwave strength
increases and exceeds the critical value, signiﬁcant pulsations of the plasma wave amplitude occur. These pulsations
indicate that signiﬁcant energy exchange takes place between the plasma wave and the driver. This eﬀect can be
exploited in a plasma wakeﬁeld accelerator driven by a microbunched electron beam [7]: bunches in the head of the
beam excite while those in the back deplete plasma waves, thereby gaining energy.

Relativistic bi-stability was originally described [6] for a magnetized electron subjected to cyclotron heating. Appli-
cations of RB to electron cyclotron heating of fusion plasmas [8, 9] have been later suggested. Although the nonlinear
nature of electron plasma waves has been noted before [10, 11, 12, 13], the RB of plasma waves has not been explored,
either as a basic phenomenon or in the context of plasma-based accelerators.

The one-dimensional relativistic dynamics of the cold plasma driven by a beatwave can be described using a
Lagrangian displacement of the plasma element originally located at z0: z(t) = z0 + ζ(t, z0).
It is assumed that
the beatwave generated by either a pair of frequency-detuned laser beams, or a modulated electron beam, is moving
with the speed close to the speed of light c, and, therefore, all beatwave quantities are functions of the co-moving
coordinate τ ′ = ωp(t

pendulum [6, 14], including a weakly damped one. Equilibrium solutions are meaningful only if the plasma wave is

ramp-up and most of the ramp-down of the laser pulse (although phase-locking is lost when the pulse amplitude
becomes very small on the down-ramp). As the result, plasma wave amplitude returns to a very small value in the
wake of the beatwave, as shown by a dot-dashed line in Fig. 2. The longer is the beatwave pulse duration τL, the
smaller is the wake because its non-vanishing amplitude is due to the adiabaticity violation for ﬁnite τL.

Situation changes for a0 > acrit: as a(τ ) approaches acrit, the adiabatic condition is violated (noted in the context
of electron cyclotron heating [8, 9]), and phase-locking at φ0 = π/2 is no longer possible. Thus, the transfer to

π/2, with u following along the Branch 3. Without
of the beatwave amplitude results in phase-locking at φ0 =
damping, there is no mechanism for the plasma wave to reach the equilibrium amplitude given by the upper Branch
3. As shown below, a conservation law prohibits the jump between Branches 1 and 3.

Nevertheless, even without damping, a signiﬁcant plasma wave is left behind the ﬁnite-duration beatwave pulse
(Fig. 2, solid line). The previously unaccessible ﬁnite-amplitude solution has been reached due to the eﬀect of the
dynamic RB which is best understood through the conservation of the eﬀective Hamiltonian of the driven plasma
wave. The eﬀective Hamiltonian

can be used to express Eqs. (2,3) in the form of ˙u = (1/u)dH/dφ, ˙φ =
(1/u)dH/du. For a slowly changing beatwave
amplitude a(τ ) the Hamiltonian is almost conserved: dH/dτ = 0.5u sin φda/dτ
0. This constitutes the conservation
law preventing the jump between Branches 1 and 3. For the initially quiescent plasma a = 0 and u = 0 before the
arrival of the beatwave. Therefore, H
0 after its passage, as conﬁrmed by numerical simulations of various pulse
durations and amplitudes. Remarkably, in addition to the trivial quiescent plasma solution u = 0, there is a second
ω2)/3 solution satisfying H(u∞) = 0. Thus, a plasma wave with H = 0 is dynamically bi-stable: after
u∞ = 4
the passage of the beatwave it can be either quiescent, or have the ﬁnite amplitude u∞. It is conjectured that, by
using a beatwave pulse with a0 > acrit, the latter solution can be accessed, thereby leaving a wake of a substantial
plasma wave with amplitude u∞.

This conjecture is veriﬁed by numerically integrating Eqs. (2,3) for two diﬀerent detunings (resonant, with ω = 1,
and non-resonant, with ω = 0.95) and two beatwave amplitudes (sub-threshold, with a0 = 0.018, and above-threshold,
with a0 = 0.023). In all cases the Gaussian pulse duration was chosen τL = 150. In physical units, for the plasma
density of n0 = 1019cm−3 the corresponding pulse duration is tL ≡
750 fs. Simulation results are shown in
Fig. 2, where the solid line corresponds to the most interesting of the three cases: ω = 0.95 and a0 = 0.023. The
plasma wave amplitude of u
0.75 in the wake of the laser pulse is in a good agreement with u∞ = 0.72. This
wake owes its existence to the dynamic RB: upon interacting with the above-threshold laser beatwave, plasma wave is
transferred from the quiescent state of u = 0 to the excited state of u = u∞. The sub-threshold excitation (dot-dashed
line) with the same detuning fails to transfer the plasma into the excited state, yielding a negligible wake that is an
order of magnitude smaller than in the above-threshold regime.

Linear theory also fails to describe the strong wake in this example because the detuning and the pulse duration
ω2)
are chosen such that the linear prediction ulin = a0/(1
0 is negligibly small. Resonant
excitation (dashed line) also yields a much smaller wave. Moreover, the resonantly and the sub-threshold excited
plasma waves would have been even smaller had the adiabatic assumption been fully satisﬁed. Indeed, it is numerically
conﬁrmed that the wake amplitudes for the resonant and the sub-threshold excitations rapidly decline for longer pulses,

Dynamical RB described in this Letter is diﬀerent from the standard equilibrium bi-stablity of a weakly-damped
nonlinear oscillator [6, 14] in that the former does not require phase-locking, only the conservation of the eﬀective
Hamiltonian H. As Fig 3(b) indicates, phase locking at φ0 = π/2 exists only during the switch-on half of the beatwave,

2τL < τ < 0. The plasma wave phase is released afterwards (0 < τ < τd) as the pulse amplitude settles into u = u∞.

Depending on the delay time, the second pulse can either (i) lock the phase at φ0 = π/2 (as shown in Fig 3(b)), with
0, or (ii) fail to lock the phase, resulting in u = u∞ after the pulse
the consequent decay of the plasma wave to u
pair. Phase locking at φ0 =
π/2 indicative of a transfer to the equilibrium Branch 3 and, therefore, equilibrium
bi-stability, is never observed.

So far the eﬀect of the plasma wave on the driver has been neglected. Of course, the energy of the plasma wave

by a laser pulse, this depletion can be described in the language of photon deceleration, or red-shifting Wilks et al..
In the context of the laser beatwave the red-shifting corresponds to the scattering of the photons from the higher

In full ﬂux-surface computer studies of tokamak edge tur-
bulence, a spectrum of shear ﬂows is found to control the
turbulence level and not just the conventional (0,0)-mode
ﬂows. Flux tube domains too small for the large poloidal
scale lengths of the continuous spectrum tend to overesti-
mate the ﬂows, and thus underestimate the transport. It is
shown analytically and numerically that under certain condi-
tions dominant (0,0)-mode ﬂows independent of the domain
size develop, essentially through Bose–Einstein condensation
of the shear ﬂows.

The energy conﬁnement of tokamaks is mainly con-
trolled by small-scale (∼cm) turbulence giving rise to
the “anomalous transport”. Analytical and computer-
aided studies have found that the anomalous transport
in turn is often controlled by ﬂuctuating “zonal ﬂows”
[1,2], poloidal shear ﬂows, which are assumed to have
zero poloidal and toroidal mode number, but have ra-
dial scales similar to the turbulence. The present paper
deals with the question what happens to the shear ﬂows
when the turbulence scale-lengths become very small
compared to the plasma size such as in the tokamak edge,
in particular in future large machines. In this limit, the
shear ﬂows can either contain a ﬁnite (0, 0)-mode com-
ponent, or may loose their global character and change
into vortices with ﬁnite poloidal scale length, as will be
demonstrated by numerical full ﬂux-surface edge turbu-
lence studies. Regarding their large poloidal and parallel
but small (similar to the turbulence) radial scale-lengths,
these vortices should not be regarded as drift-waves or
convective cells [3] but rather as poloidally localized shear
ﬂows.

For cost reasons, the domains of turbulence simula-
tions are usually thin ﬂux tubes [4] or tokamak sectors
[5], equivalent to ﬂux tubes with special boundary con-
ditions. The ﬂux tube dimensions perpendicular to the
magnetic ﬁeld are of the order of ∼ 10cm and they extend
several ∼ 10m along the magnetic ﬁeld to accomodate
the prevalent turbulent structures. For poloidally local-
ized shear ﬂows, however, these computational domains
are not adequate and the ﬂows always appear to extend
across the complete ﬂux tube. Since the (0, 0) mode is
not damped as the other modes, it may therefore exert
a strong stabilizing eﬀect on the turbulence, which un-
derestimates the transport compared to a true full ﬂux-
surface simulation. For the core turbulence, which has
relatively large scales, full torus simulations [6,7] exhibit
zonal ﬂows extending over the complete ﬂux surfaces.
However, even for these scenarios it is not clear, whether

this remains true for much larger ratio of ﬂux surface
circumference to turbulence scale length or whether the
ﬂows have a ﬁnite scale length in poloidal direction.

Following the numerical results, an analytic model for
the shear ﬂows is described, in which their poloidal and
radial wavenumber spectra are controlled by the interplay
of damping by the collisional electron response and ion
dissipation, the linear response of the turbulence to the
ﬂows, and the excitation of ﬂows by random ﬂuctuations.
Under certain conditions, a non-zero fraction of the ﬂow
energy is generated as (0, 0)-mode ﬂows, regardless of the
system size. The mechanism is analogous to the Bose–
Einstein condensation (BEC). The three eﬀects acting
on the ﬂows take the role of absorption, stimulated, and
spontaneous emission. For the BEC, a macroscopic frac-
tion of the quanta is eventually scattered into the ground
state because the state density near the ground state is
too low to hold suﬃciently many quanta under the preva-
lent conditions. For the ﬂow system, the turbulence and
shear ﬂows form a feed back loop, which regulates the
shear ﬂow energy to the level needed for turbulence sat-
uration. Condensation into the (0, 0) ﬂow component
occurs when a threshold in required ﬂow energy is ex-
ceeded, and the m 6= 0 modes are unable to hold it.
Numerical results. — We discuss the results of tur-
bulence simulations of the three dimensional electrostatic
drift Braginskii equations with isothermal electrons (a
subset of the equations of Ref. [8]) for two diﬀerent cases:
(a) the predominant instability is the resistive balloon-
ing mode with the nondimensional parameters αd = 0.2,
ǫn = 0.08, q = 5, τ = 1, ηi = 1, ˆs = 1; (b) there is a
signiﬁcant contribution from ITG modes with αd = 0.4,
ηi = 3 and the other parameters as in (a). The radial
domain width in terms of the resistive ballooning scale
length, L0, in (a) was 24L0 and in (b) 48L0, the width
Lθ perpendicular to r and B was 24L0 [only for (a)],
192L0, 384L0, and 768L0 (the corresponding tokamak
minor radius is a = Lθq/(2π)). For a deﬁnition of these
parameters and units see Refs. [8,9]. The parameters of
the largest domain are consistent with the physical pa-
rameters R = 3 m, a = 1.5 m, Ln = 12 cm, q0 = 3.2,
n = 3.5 × 1019 m−3, Zeﬀ = 4, B0 = 3.5 T, and for (a)
T = 100 eV, L0 = 5.1 mm, ρs = 0.58 mm and for (b)
T = 200 eV, L0 = 3.6 mm, ρs = 0.82 mm. The perpen-
dicular grid step size was ∆ = 0.19L0 (a) and ∆ = 0.38L0
(b). Parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld 12 points per poloidal
connection length were suﬃcient due to the large parallel
scales of the ballooning modes. The largest runs had a
grid of 128 × 4096 × 12.
The dependence of the average (0, 0) shear ﬂow energy
density on the domain size, Lθ, is compared for the two

1

cases in Fig. 1. In contrast to case (b), the shear ﬂows
in (a) are apparently not condensed into the (0, 0) mode
since its energy density decreases proportional to 1/Lθ ∝
1/a, as is expected when a given shear ﬂow energy density
is distributed equally among an increasingly dense set of
modes.

The kθ spectrum of the ﬂow velocity, v = vθ = ∂rφ,
for the Lθ = 768L0 runs [for case (a) see Fig. 2] exhibits
a rise at low kθ associated with the shear ﬂows, diﬀerent
from the microturbulence ﬂuctuations at kθ ∼ 1. The
square amplitude of the m = 0 mode in case (a) and (b)
is 0.3 and 7 times, respectively, the total shear ﬂow am-
plitude, suggesting strong condensation for (b). In both
cases, the typical poloidal scale length of the m 6= 0 shear
ﬂows is roughly a factor 10 greater than the scales of the
turbulence. Failure of the computational domain to ac-
comodate the scales of the uncondensed shear ﬂows in
case (a) results in an overestimate of the shear ﬂow am-
plitude, and hence in an underestimate of the anomalous
transport. The particle ﬂux for Lθ = Lr = 24L0 was
found to be 25% lower than for Lθ = 768L0.

Analytic model. — As the ﬁrst ingredient of a quali-
tative model for the poloidal shear ﬂow spectra, we cal-
culate the linear dispersion relation for ﬁnitely elongated
shear ﬂows. For clarity, in the linear electrostatic vortic-
ity equation (with the plasma parameters absorbed into
the units, see, e.g., [9]),

⊥(∂t + γ)φ + ∂ 2
∇2

kφ = 0,

(1)

we neglect temperature ﬂuctuations, parallel ion velocity,
drift eﬀects, curvature and magnetic ﬂuctuations. These
eﬀects can lead to a real frequency (e.g., geodesic acous-
tic modes [10,11]) and to a coupling to parallel sound
waves or Alfv´en waves. The dissipative eﬀects are the
ﬂow damping γ due to the ion dissipation assumed inde-
pendent of the wavenumber and the damping due to the
resistive electron response. As we will see below, for a po-
tential condensation of the shear ﬂows into global modes
only a small region around a certain radial wavenumber,
k0, is important, which we set to one in (1) since its abso-
lute value is not important. Because of the large poloidal
wavelengths of the ﬂows, we approximate −∇2
0 = 1
and obtain the dispersion relation

⊥ ≈ k2

k(cid:17) ,
ωlin = −i(cid:16)γ + k2

kk = (cid:18) m

q(r) − n(cid:19) .

(2)

The damping by the parallel resistive electron response
is weak if either m = n = 0 holds, or r is near a resonant
surface deﬁned by m − nq(rmn) = 0. Focusing on a thin
region around r = r0 we obtain kk ≈ mα0(r − rmn),
α0 = −q′(r0)/q(r0)2. Hence the resistive ﬂow damping is
proportional to m2, which is the reason for the poloidal
elongation of the ﬂows, i.e., their low mode numbers.

As reaction to a shear ﬂow [1,2,12,13] the microturbu-
lence may in turn inﬂuence the ﬂows via the Reynolds
stress [14,15] or the Stringer–Winsor mechanism due to

poloidal pressure asymmetries [10,16]. Restricting our-
selves to linear response theory, we assume a (coherent)
ﬂow ampliﬁcation rate g(kr) depending only on the radial
wavenumber kr, because of the large poloidal correlation
lengths of the shear ﬂows. With the (incoherent) random
forcing, f , representing the eﬀect of the turbulence ﬂuc-
tuations, the equation for the ﬂow amplitude in frequency
space has the form of a Langevin equation,

∂tv = −iωlinv + g(kr)v + f.

(3)

From (3) we obtain a relation between the mean square

spectra of the ﬂows and the forcing in frequency space,

|ˆv|2 =

| ˆf|2

ω2 + (−iωlin + g(kr))2 .

(4)

Assuming that | ˆf|2 is independent of k, ω (white noise),
the integration of (4) over ω yields the relation between
the mean square ﬂow amplitude at an instant of time and
the forcing,

|v|2 =

| ˆf|2π

| − iωlin + g(kr)|

.

(5)

The ﬂow intensity (5) replaces the Bose distribution in
the BEC case. Both functions tend to inﬁnity when the
ampliﬁcation (stimulated emission) terms approach the
damping (absorption) terms. As long as every mode is
net-damped at a rate independent of the system size, the
energy density stored in (0,0) modes must decrease pro-
portional to the system size, since the total shear ﬂow
energy is distributed among an increasingly dense set of
modes. However, analogous to the thermodynamic the-
ory of the BEC, when the continuous ﬂow spectrum is
unable to hold the shear ﬂow energy for non-zero min-
imum net-damping rate and given random forcing, the
nonlinear ﬂow ampliﬁcation term must adjust so that
the remaining part of the ﬂow energy is excited in the
form of the most weakly damped modes, which are (0,0)
modes. Hence, to demonstrate the possibility of conden-
sation, it has to be shown that the ﬂow amplitude in
m 6= 0 modes stays ﬁnite when the net-damping rate of
the m = 0 modes tends to zero, in the limit of inﬁnite
system size or, equivalently, in the approximation of a
continuous poloidal mode spectrum.

It is suﬃciently general, to assume that g(kr) has a
maximum at kr = k0 of order of the turbulence wavenum-
bers and is parabolic near that maximum, g(kr) = g0 −
g1(kr − k0)2. The ampliﬁcation terms will nearly can-
cel the damping terms only for wavenumbers near k0,
which justiﬁes the approximation kr ≈ k0 which was
made in the derivation of (2). For the following anal-
ysis we shift the kr spectrum of the ﬂows so that k0 = 0.
With ikr = ∂r, the operator in the denominator of (5),

(γ − g0) − g1∂ 2

r + (mα0(r − rmn))2 ,

is the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian of the harmonic
oscillator. Its eigenvalue for a mode with the “quantum
numbers” (m, rmn, l), l ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . .}, is

ωl = γ − g0 + 2√g1 |α0m| (l + 1/2).

The sum over l of the eigenmode contributions to (5) at
ﬁxed (m, rmn) results in a logarithmic divergence, which
stems from the inﬁnitely broad random forcing spectrum
and inﬁnitely fast turbulence response. Hence, we cut
oﬀ ωl at an appropriate ωc depending on the turbulence.
The sum is then approximated by an integral over l. The
resulting amplitude associated with each pair (m, rmn) is

rational surfaces is |α0m| for given m. Approximating
the sum over all |v|2(m, rmn) contributions to (5) with
m 6= 0 by an integral (which becomes exact for inﬁnite
system size), the total instantaneous energy density of
the ﬂow modes with m 6= 0,

obtain

This expression converges to a ﬁnite value for Ω → 0. On
the other hand, because the energy density of the m = 0
modes, which tends to inﬁnity for Ω → 0 [the integral
over kr of (5) does not exist for −iωlin + g0 = 0], has
If the turbulence

saturation requires a higher ﬂow level than (9) at Ω → 0,
the description of the system by a continuum of poloidal
mode numbers breaks down, the ﬂow energy which can
not be received by the m 6= 0 modes condenses into m = 0
modes, and simultaneously Ω → 0.
In a similar manner, it can be shown that in the limit of
inﬁnite system size the m = 0 condensate is completely
contained in the n = 0 modes. Furthermore, there is
no condensation of the radial wave numbers but the kr
spectrum becomes arbitarily narrow around the point of
weakest net-damping for large system size.

Strictly speaking, condensation is unprovable by nu-
merical studies, due to the restriction to ﬁnite system
sizes. However, the validity of the individual parts of
the model can be checked in the simulations. The local-
ization of the m 6= 0 shear ﬂows on resonant surfaces is
obvious in a plot of the ﬂow spectra versus radius (Fig. 3).
The total ﬂow amplitude associated with each (m, rmn)

3

quantum number in Eq. (7) (Fig. 4) has much weaker
slope than k−2
θ ∝ m−2 for kθ, m → 0. Therefore the in-
tegral over all m 6= 0 shear ﬂows (8) is expected to be
ﬁnite in the limit of inﬁnite system size (even if the esti-
mate (7) for the individual amplitudes should be quanti-
tatively wrong). Furthermore, the integral is reasonably
well approximated by the corresponding sum in the ﬁnite
system. Consequently, the inﬁnite system will have ap-
proximately the same ratio of m = 0 ﬂow amplitude to
m 6= 0 ﬂow amplitude. Finally, we note that the numer-
ical studies agree with the above analytical prediction,
that the ﬂow condensate exhibits a strong peaking in kr
for suﬃciently large system size.

Conclusions and consequences. — It has been shown
numerically that in general the shear ﬂows controlling
the turbulence are not only (0, 0) modes but rather
consist of a spectrum of poloidal mode numbers. The
(m, n) 6= (0, 0) ﬂows diﬀer from drift waves or convec-
tive cells by their large poloidal [10 times larger than the
turbulence (Fig. 2)] and parallel scale length, while their
perpendicular scale length is similar to that of the tur-
bulence. These shear ﬂows are localized in the vicinity
of resonant surfaces (Fig. 3). In the limit of large system
size, a non-zero (0,0)-mode amplitude develops only if
the shear ﬂows undergo a condensation into these modes,
analogous to the Bose–Einstein condensation. Several
features predicted by the analytic model have been re-
produced by the numerical simulations.

Due to the cancelling of damping and ampliﬁcation
terms, the (0, 0) ﬂow condensate is practically undamped.
This means in quantum mechanical language that the
rate of absorption and incoherent re-emission, the “col-
lision” rate, vanishes. Hence, far ranging interactions
or ordering eﬀects might be mediated via the shear ﬂow
condensate (but not by the uncondensed ﬂows that suﬀer
collisions and are pinned to resonant surfaces). As a con-
sequence in the simple system used here the kr spectra
become arbitrarily narrow.

Since the ﬂows depend on the distribution of ratio-
nal surfaces and mode numbers, to accurately model
the shear ﬂow system in numerical studies, care has to
be taken to not introduce spurious resonant surfaces or
modes, e.g., by parallel extension of the ﬂux tube [4,5].
Remarkably, it can be shown that increasing the ﬂux tube
length does not lead to the correct limit of large system
sizes, since, e.g., for an inﬁnitely long ﬂux tube, conden-
sation into (0, 0) modes can not occur.

Up to now, in ﬂux tube based turbulence computa-
tions the shear ﬂows were implicitly assumed to be global
modes. With domain widths too small for the large
poloidal scales of the continuous part of the ﬂow spec-
trum, the ﬂows appear to have zero poloidal and toroidal
mode number. Such modes do not experience the resis-
tive damping, which would reduce the ﬂow amplitude in
a full system. Hence, the simulations tend to overesti-
mate the total ﬂow amplitude, which may therefore ex-
ert a strong stabilizing eﬀect on the turbulence. To avoid
an underestimate of the transport, ﬂux tube simulations

have to be checked for inﬂuences of a ﬁnite poloidal scale
length of the ﬂows.

Abstract

A non-equilibrium plasma was studied using classical electrodynamic ﬁeld theory. Non-linear

interaction terms contribute to a ﬁnite lifetime for the dressed electrodynamic ﬁeld. The lifetime

dependence, where n is the number density, Te is the electron tem-

perature, Ti is the ion temperature, and Tr is the temperature of the radiation ﬁeld. The resulting

width of the plasmon resonance is shown to decrease as equilibrium is approached. Dynamic

screening leads to opaqueness of the plasma for low energy electromagnetic radiation. This leads

to a quadratic correction to the quartic Stefan-Boltzmann law. We also brieﬂy discuss the eﬀect

of dynamic screening on fusion rates. Solitonic solutions to our non-linear wave equation allow

localization of positive charges, which may enhance fusion rates.

INTRODUCTION

Non-equilibrium plasmas have been investigated theoretically in several regimes by many

authors1,2,3,4. These papers focus on approximations to deal with inter-particle collisions

in plasmas. They develop various models to describe the temporal progress of a non-local-

thermal-equilibrium (NLTE) plasma towards equilibrium.

Recently, probative experiments have ben performed on the passage towards equilibrium

of a plasma in non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE)5. The paper by Taccetti at al5 gives a

putative bound of about 1ns as the time required for the NLTE plasma in their experiment

to achieve equilibrium. There will be a similar bound for any other NLTE plasma. On

time scales much smaller than this measure, one may safely assume that a NLTE plasma

is frozen, viz., the electron temperature is diﬀerent from the ion temperature. But light

can travel appreciable distances on this time scale (e.g. 3cm in 0.1ns), so that we need to

consider the time dependence of electromagnetic ﬁelds. By extending the static methods of

Jaﬀe and Brown6 and Chitanvis7, we can consider the classical statistics of the electrody-

namic ﬁeld in a non-relativistic NLTE plasma. By varying the electron temperature, the

ion temperature, as well as the temperature of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, we can study para-

metrically the passage of an NLTE towards local thermal equilibrium (LTE). Phenomena

such as Bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering of hot electrons which equilibrate

the temperature of electrons and the radiation ﬁeld, and electron-ion collisions, which equi-

librate the energy between electrons and ions could be considered in the future to describe

the temporal development of a non-equilibrium plasma towards LTE.

We have focused here on the dynamic dielectric constant of a non-equilibrium plasma,

which can be measured in a laboratory. The dispersive properties of this quantity will be

discussed. We propose that experiments be performed to test our predictions.

II. FORMULATION OF THE STATISTICAL THEORY

The electrostatic interaction between any two charges sitting in a collection of other

charges is inevitably screened by intervening charges. This eﬀect becomes more dominant

as the density of charges increases. Thus calculating the screening of the bare Coulomb

interaction could be important for high-density plasmas. The paper by Varela et al8 gives a

recent overview of various methods brought to bear on this aspect of plasma physics. Some

of these methods develop ideas based on the work of Fisher and Levin9. Our ﬁeld-theoretic

method bears a close resemblance to the approach of Brown and Jaﬀe6 and Chitanvis7. We

shall focus on the calculation of non-linear eﬀects on the electrodynamics of a NLTE plasma.

These non-linear eﬀects are expected to dominate at high charge densities.

An assumption we will make is that on the scale that ﬂuid motion takes place, the

individual plasma components have separately reached thermal equilibrium, such that the

ions of a specie possess a temperature which is diﬀerent than the electron temperature.

The scalar potential φ of a plasma composed of a single atomic specie, having an atomic

number Z, and number density n is governed by:

ρ = ρ+ + ρ−

ρ+ = e n Z exp(

e n Z exp(eφ/kTe)

ρ− =

(1)

where c is the speed of light, ρ is the charge density, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, e

is the electronic charge, Ti is the ion temperature, Te is the electron temperature, and n is

the average number density of the plasma. Since we consider a non-relativistic plasma, we

can neglect the eﬀects of the vector potential, which are

(v/c), compared to the potential

O

φ. We have assumed that positive and negative charge densities are governed by Boltzmann

distributions, and the electron temperature is in general diﬀerent from the ion temperature.

In so doing, we are making the assumption that quantum eﬀects are unimportant. Now, for

the case of plasmas in local thermal equilibrium, Gruzinov and Bahcall10, among others, have

estimated that quantum eﬀects give rise to small deviations from Eqn.1 for the screening

length. This could be important for certain applications.

Expanding the right hand side to third order in the electrostatic potential (basically in

powers of a parameter Γ which is analogous to the usual plasma expansion parameter), it

can be shown that:

where τ = Te/Ti, Γ is a parameter analogous to the usual plasma parameter. Basically,

we use Λ as a length scale rather than the mean free distance, since Λ appears naturally

in the theory. n0 is the average number density of the plasma, and λDH is the standard

Debye-Huckel screening length, which holds in the case of a single-component plasma.

Equation 3 demonstrates as long as Γ << 1 the coupling constants σ2 < 1, σ3 < 1, as

long as Zτ not too high. In this sense, we have tried to ensure that our series expansion is

at least formally convergent. The value of τ ranges between a number much greater than

one to unity, as the non-equilibrium plasma tends towards equilibrium. As an example,

we note that at Te = 1keV , Λ

Furthermore, note that retaining non-linear terms on the right hand side of Eqn.1, in

powers of Γ, is equivalent to seeking corrections due to the high density of the plasma4. The

number of terms that need to be retained thus depend on Γ.

Now in the linear case when σ2 = σ3 = 0 in Eqn.2, it is easy to see that our plasma has an

eﬀective screening length Λ which is given by the standard single-component Debye-Huckel

length divided by a factor of

(Zτ + 1)Z. Thus this correction can be signiﬁcant for large

Z, and for cases when there is a large temperature diﬀerence between the electrons and ions.

The cubic term can be interpreted as a three-wave interaction, and the quartic a four-wave

process– If second quantization is employed, these terms would correspond to three-photon

and four-photon processes. One may perhaps expect these terms to be important in the

high energy density regime. Moreover, the theory bears a formal resemblance to the theory

of phase transitions. However, we do not have a phase transition to contend with, and hence

the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations could be minimal, and mean ﬁeld theory (Eqn.3 corresponds to a

dynamic Debye-Huckel approximation) would be suﬃcient to describe the system. In fact

detailed calculations presented in this paper show that higher order processes are not be

important as far as renormalization of the plasmon frequency are concerned. But they are

essential if one wishes to consider the lifetime of the dressed electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Since we have a time-independent Lagrangian density, the momentum π

The appearance of an imaginary term preceding the logarithm gives rise to a lifetime

for electromagnetic excitations, analogous to the lifetime of a quasi-particle. Furthermore,

there is an additional contribution to the lifetime for 1 < 4/(ω2 + k2).

accessible to experiments. Qualitatively, this is what one expects to occur in a plasma12.

For suﬃciently large frequencies, far from the plasmon frequency, one expects a long-lived

wave. This eﬀect is exempliﬁed in Fig.2. This ﬁgure shows the spectral weight for two

This shows that the plasmon frequency ωp does not depend sensitively on the coupling constants,

which in turn depend on the plasma parameters. Note that while the theory itself is formally

valid for values of the coupling constant less than one, we have used larger values of the coupling

constants only for exposition.

system approached equilibrium.

Third-order interactions (corresponding to three photon processes) lead to ﬁnite lifetimes

a correspondence between our approach, which focuses on the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and the

ensemble consisting of electrons and ions. A similar connection must exist for the dynamic

case considered here as well. Relaxation rates for collisions between ions and electrons can

be computed for various regimes13. Not only does our theory account for such inter-particle

collisions in an integrated sense6, but addresses radiative processes as well. The inverse of

the rate we consider here is a measure of the time required for electromagnetic energy in a

speciﬁc part of the spectrum to be given to other parts of the spectrum.

VI. QUANTUM TUNNELING

We will consider brieﬂy in this section the eﬀect of dynamic screening on fusion rates.

Toward the end of the section, we indulge in speculating how the thermal rate of fusion

may be aﬀected in NLTE plasmas. This may be considered a prelude to a full-ﬂedged study

of nuclear fusion rates in non-equilibrium plasmas. We have restored dimensionality of all

parameters in this section.

charges on the interacting particles. µ is the reduced mass of the two nuclear interacting

particles, v is the relative speed, and E is the sum of the kinetic energy and the static

screening eﬀect.

It is seen that accounting for the ﬁnite speed of light causes the screening length to increase,

i.e., the range of the interaction increases, allowing for repulsion over a larger distance.

Hence we expect the penetration factor to decrease.

Upon expanding in powers of r, since we are only interested in short separations, and

further, retaining only leading order terms in Ek, we obtain an addition to the argument in

the penetration factor:

eﬀects in more detail. Here we have presented an alternative treatment of the same eﬀect.

Note that this theory is based on the assumption that the charge density follows the

classical Boltzmann distribution even at nuclear distances. This point has been questioned

by many authors, e.g. Gruzinov and Bahcall10 for the case of a plasma in local thermal

equilibrium. They ﬁnd that quantum eﬀects change the screening length by approximately

1% in the solar interior. We will consider such eﬀects for a NLTE plasma in a future paper.

It is well-known that the fusion rate at a ﬁnite temperature is directly proportional to

the relative fraction of the reactants. Hence it is possible that if concentration of reactants

is increased locally, it would enhance fusion in that spatial region. To see that such charge

conﬁgurations may occur in our system, let us consider the wave equation to the second

order in the potential:

manifested in the charge density, displayed as the red curve. Notice how the positive charge

gets localized by a surrounding negative charge density. Furthermore, we have lowered in
Fig. 4the charge density by a scaling factor of σ′

2 < 1. This represents a deviation from the

average charge density, which will be much lower. The fact that positive charges (nuclei)

have been localized will enhance the rate of fusion. Of course, whether such localization

occurs in a given plasma depends on initial and boundary conditions on the NLTE plasma.

statistical theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld interacting with charges was developed for

this purpose. Diagrammatic techniques were utilized to obtain leading order estimates of

the lifetime of the plasmon resonance due to three-wave interactions. Eﬀects of dynamic

screening on radiative properties were deduced. We speculated on the manner in which

solitonic solutions could allow localized enhancement of positive charges, which in turn

would increase fusion rates.

We propose that the techniques developed, and results obtained in this paper could be

density. Note how non-linear eﬀects serve to localize the positive charge.

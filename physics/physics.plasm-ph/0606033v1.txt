Abstract

Collisionless energy absorption in 1D nanoplasma layer is considered.
Straightforward classical calculation of the absorption rate in action-angle
variables is presented. In regular regime the result obtained is the same
as in [4], but deeper insight is possible now due to the technique used.
Chirikov criterion of the chaotic absorption regime is written out. Col-
lisionless energy absorption rate in nanoplasma layer is calculated in
stochastic regime.

1 Collisionless absorption in regular regime.

One of the novel problems of laser-matter interaction is the problem of energy
absorption in nanometer targets subjected to an ultrashort (up to few picosec-
ond) intence (1013 −1017W/cm2) laser ﬁelds. During such interaction hot (up to
several keV energy) classical plasma bounded in nanoscale volume is produced,
which has a life time of about hundreds of femtoseconds. This is dense plasma
with the electron density of 1023cm−3 and more. Such systems are used to be
called nanoplasma since ﬁrst experiments of intense short laser interaction with
three-dimensional nanobodies (atomic Van-der-Vaals clusters) were hold in 1996
[1].

Nanobodies are known to absorb much more compared to traditional tar-
gets like gas or even bulk. The great amount of energy contained in tiny volume
results in breakdown, birth of energetic particles and high harmonics genera-
tion [2, 3]. Diﬀerent mechanisms of absorption were suggested to explain such
phenomena. They are inner ionization, inverse bremsstrahlung eﬀect, vacuum
heating, collisionless heating and some others a bit more sophisticated.

As far as nanoplasma is a strongly bounded system with the width much less
than laser wave length, the most interesting mechanism of energy absorption in
it is collisionless heating in self-consistent potential. It was considered recently
in one-dimensional systems corresponded to irradiated ﬁlms and more deeply in
three-dimesional systems which correspond to nanoclusters; the important role
of it in the absorption process was evidently shown (for 1D situation see [4]).

The problem of collisionless energy absorption in thin ﬁlms irradiated by
intence short laser pulse was considered in [4] in the frames of the following
model. First, the incompressible liquid approximation for the electronic cloud
was used1 and both the self-consistent potential and distribution function were
taken as if they are known function slowly changing on times of the laser pulse
duration. This means that the self-consisted system of Boltsman and Laplace
equations was supposed to be solved elsewhere. Then, in [4] dipole aproxima-
tion2 and the perturbation theory on the small parameter of the dimensionless
oscillation amplitude of the electron cloud3 was used. Here we use the same
model. The calculation of the rate of collisionless absorption presented in [4]
was based on quantum-mechanical approach in quasiclassical limit. Note, that
the system considered is classical, and the ﬁnal result in [4] does not contain
Plank constant. Althogh this method is non-contradictory, it hides some clas-
sical features of the system. The present paper has the aim to make the same
calculation for this system in the frames of classical mechanics and to learn more
about it possible behaviour.

Let the particle is bounded in self-consistent potential U (z), with the energy

distribution function F(ǫ). Mean absorbed energy is deﬁned as:

q =

dǫF(ǫ)q(ǫ),

Z

(1)

where q(ǫ) – is the work of the ﬁeld over the particle with energy ǫ in the time
unit, averaged with the initial condition for this particle. Due to the shielding
eﬀect external

E(t) = E0 cos(ωt).
and internal E laser ﬁelds diﬀers, and in the model of incompressible ﬂuid used
in [4] there is a relation

(3)

where ωp is plasma frequency, Γ is the damphing constant, and we direct electric
ﬁeld along z-axis.

One-particle Hamilton function of the system considered has the form:

H(p, z, t) =

+ U (z) − eEzz cos(ωt + α) ≡ H0 + Vint.

(4)

It is convenient to come to the action-angle variables (I, Θ), deﬁned for the
non-perturbed system in a standart way [5]:

I =

∂Sg(z, I)
∂I

we omit highly oscillating terms. Then Hamilton function looks like

H(I, Θ) = H0(I) −

zs(I) cos((2s + 1)Θ − ωt), zn ≡ zs.

Slow change of the one-particle distribution function on large time scale is
a diﬀusion in action (energy) space (see, for example, [6]), and may be deﬁned
by the Fokker-Plank-Kolmogorov equation

which is deﬁned on large (ideally inﬁnite) observation time T, and do not de-
pend on it. δI is the addition to unperturbed action under the inﬂuence of
the perturbation in (4). To deﬁne it we should write down and solve motion

(13)
To get the energy gain in regular regime without stochasticisy in such description
we should take the formal limit T → ∞, because nothing can change the particle

and delta-symbol δrs appears, and ﬁnaly diﬀusion coeﬃcient in regular regime
reads as

This result repeats the result from [4], where it was obtained on the quasiclassical
language. The sum over s here means that only the particle at resonant levels

ω = (2s + 1)Ω(ǫ)

(16)

can absorb energy.

2 Chirikov criterion of the stochasticity.

The technic presented in the previous section allows to describe classical motion
of the particles in nanoplasma in the region of parameters, where quasiclassical
description used in [4] fails. Supposing that the particle has the initial energy
close to resonance energy deﬁned by the condition (16), averaging over time (4)
we obtain so-called resonant Hamilton function

H(I, Θ) = H0(I) −

zs(I) cos((2s + 1)Θ − ωt), zn ≡ zs.

According to [7] let us carry out one more canonical transformation with the
help of generating function

with Is – resonant action, corresponded to the resonance energy with the num-
ber s from (16). For new (P, Ψ ) and old (I, Θ) variables the following relations
are fulﬁlled

where the decomposition on the small deviation from the resonance action is
presented. Hamiltonian function (20) describes the nonlinear mathematical pen-
dulum. Chaotic motion begins when the amplitude in action of such a system
is greater than the distance between neighbour resonances4 [7]:

This condition means that the action oscillation near one resonance come to the
region, occupied by the nearest another one (see Fig.1). The distance between
resonances in terms of frequences, according to condition (16) is

This is overestimation: when the inequality is fulﬁlled, chaos has to take place.
In reality threshold is lower [7]. For model potentials from (23) one can ﬁnd
that in rectangular well of the 100 nm width chaotic regime begins if the inner
ﬁeld (3) is about 1015W/cm2.

3 Collisionless absorption in stochastic regime.

In the situation when chaotic behaviour is developed, to calculate the heating
rate in (13) it is nesessary to use for averaging not inﬁnite time, but such a
time τc which deﬁne the dynamical memory of the particle about its previous
history. The standart procedure to ﬁnd it is to deﬁne mapping of angle variable
[8], which in our system is

For the step time of mapping (24) the period of external laser ﬁeld was taken.
For such mapping the decorellation time τc can be estimated as [8]

τc ≃

4π
∆s ω ln K

,

where ∆s is the number of essential items χs in sum (24). In our situation it
has the order of 2s + 1. Finally, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient can be obtained from
(13) with substitution T → τc. It reads

D(I) =

(2s + 1)(2r + 1)zs(I)zr(I)∆rs(τc),

(27)

Energy gain can be obtained from the FPK-equation in the same way as we did
it earlier for regular regime (15):

In this expression all resonance levels take part in the absorption process simul-
taneously. Moreover, in such a situation particle with arbitrary energy should
gain energy from the external ﬁeld. Formula (29) is the main result of the
present work. It describes the collisionless heating in 1D classical nanoplasma
layer when the ﬁeld strength is enough for chaotic regime to take place, accord-
ing to (23).

Theory of the Laser Wake-Field Accelerator Revisited:
Wake Overtaking, Localized Spectrum and Ponderomotive Acceleration

The electron and positron acceleration in the ﬁrst cycle of a laser-driven wakeﬁeld is investi-
gated. Separatrices between diﬀerent types of the particle motion (conﬁned, reﬂected by the wake-
ﬁeld or ponderomotive potential and transient) are demonstrated. The ponderomotive acceleration
is negligible for electrons but is substantial for positrons. An electron bunch, injected as quasi-
monoenergetic, acquires a localized energy spectrum with a cut-oﬀ at the maximum energy.

Laser-driven charged particle acceleration is an attractive alternative to cyclic accelerators and linacs, promising to
provide much greater acceleration rate with a much more compact facility. At the dawn of the laser technology the
“optical maser” was suggested in Ref. [1] to accelerate electrons. The long-living strong Langmuir wave (wakeﬁeld),
left in the wake of a short intense laser pulse in a low-density collisionless plasma, accelerates duly injected electrons
[2]. For eﬃcient acceleration of charged
in the Laser Wake-Field Accelerator (LWFA) concept introduced in Ref.
particles, the laser pulse must be relativistically strong, i. e., its amplitude a0 = eE0/meωc > 1. To provide electrons
one must use an externally preaccelerated electron bunch or exploit the eﬀect of self-injection due to a longitudinal
Langmuir wave-break [3] or/and a transverse wave-break [4], which dominates when the laser pulse waist becomes
comparable with or less than the wakeﬁeld wavelength, e. g., due to the pulse self-focusing. The injection of the

occurs when the displacement of the plasma electron ﬂuid moving in the wave becomes equal to or larger than the
wakeﬁeld wavelength λwf = 4π√2 c a0/ωpe, where ωpe =

4πnee2/me is the Langmuir frequency.

p
In recent experiments localized energy spectra of electrons accelerated up to 170 MeV were demonstrated [6, 7].
The indications were given that the laser pulse undergo a self-focusing, and the wave-breaking (both the longitudinal
and transverse) occures in the ﬁrst cycle of the wakeﬁeld with the electron self-injection into the acceleration phase.
In Ref. [6] the localized electron energy spectrum formation was attributed to electrons accelerated in the wakeﬁeld
ﬁrst cycle, overtaking the laser pulse. The so-called “ponderomotive electron acceleration”, suggested in Ref. [8] and
[9], describes the charged particle motion at the laser pulse front, thus it is in eﬀect also in the
analyzed in Refs.
wakeﬁeld ﬁrst cycle. The positron acceleration by a long electromagnetic wave in underdense plasmas was considered
in Ref. [10].

In this Letter we revisit theory of the Laser Wake-Field Accelerator and examine the acceleration of charged particles
in the ﬁrst cycle of the wakeﬁeld. The electron energy spectrum is calculated in a general case of nonoptimal injection.
The role of the ponderomotive acceleration is discussed in the case of electrons and positrons.

A⊥ is the laser pulse vector-potential, ϕ is the the wakeﬁeld potential. In general, P⊥ and A⊥ have two components
(along y and z). Here we neglect the dispersion of the the laser pulse, assuming that the laser pulse ﬁeld depends
on time and coordinate as A⊥(x
vgt). The Hamiltonian (1) admits a Lie group with generators vg∂x + ∂t, ∂y, ∂z.

Correspondingly, the Noether theorem implies the motion integrals:

where h0 and P⊥0 are constants of the particle initial momentum. We introduce dimensionless variables

ensure the dependence of a2 on X = x

laser pulse electromagnetic wave phase velocity is equal to vph,las = 1/vg > 1. We choose the ﬁnite quasi-Gaussian

be less than, but not too much, the (relativistic) wakeﬁeld wavelegth so as to make the wakeﬁeld excitation eﬃcient

An electron started from the singular point Xs acquires the maximum kinetic energy at the top Xt of the separatrix,

shorter than a half of wakeﬁeld wavelength, then in the ﬁrst period of the wakeﬁeld the points Xs and Xt correspond,
respectively, to the local minimum and maximum of the wakeﬁeld potential, Φ(Xs) = Φmin, Φ(Xt) = Φmax. So the

In the ﬁrst period of the wakeﬁeld behind the laser pulse there is also the “conﬁned” separatrix, a segment of the
1/γph (the exact value is discussed below). It encloses a basin of orbits of electrons which

We examine the energy spectrum change of an electron bunch injected into the ﬁrst period of the wakeﬁeld wave
onto the “runaway” separatrix, Fig. 1(c). When a relatively long, initially quasi-monoenergetic, bunch is injected
from the singular point Xs and accelerated in the ﬁrst period of the wakeﬁeld wave, its particles are distributed
(X). As a result, the particle energy spectrum broadens from

The above-stated analysis concerns the phase portrait of a negatively charged particle (electron). In this paragraph
we make digression considering the case of a positively charged particle, positron. In this case formulae (4)-(6) remain

is shown in Fig. 1(d). In the wakeﬁeld, the electron’s points of equilibrium correspond to the positron’s singular points
(for suﬃciently short laser pulse). The positron injected from the singular point into the second cycle of the wakeﬁeld
returns back to the same singular point. In the ﬁrst half-cycle of the wakeﬁeld, in contrast to the case of the electron,
both forces acting on the positron – the wakeﬁeld electrostatic force and the laser pulse ponderomotive force – pull
the positron in the same direction (“forward”). Therefore we see a wide “ponderomotive” basin in which the orbits

In conclusion, in the ﬁrst cycle of the Langmuir wave in the wake of the short relativistically strong laser pulse
electrons have at least three separatrices: on the “runaway” separatrix the electron overtakes the wakeﬁeld and the
laser pulse, on the “conﬁned” separatrix it moves together with the laser pulse and the “ponderomotive” separatrix
places quite tight limit for the ponderomotive acceleration. In contrast to electrons, positrons see the wakeﬁeld and
the laser pulse ponderomotive force acting in the same direction. It is shown that the energy spectrum of the initially

Existence of stationary ﬂows in quantum non-dissipative closed circuits is not surprising - dia-

magnetic currents in atoms are one of such examples. Here, a model is constructed and rigorously

solved from the Hamiltonian level where such a dc circular spontaneous ﬂow exists in absence of a

magnetic ﬁeld, irrespective of presence of dissipation causing otherwise proper relaxation. The ﬂow

causes a spontaneous unidirectional transfer of heat from one bath to another one, even against

temperature step. This is what is explicitly forbidden by the Clausius form of the Second law

of thermodynamics. The unidirectionality of the ﬂow is caused by that of spontaneous processes

known to bear this property since their introduction by Einstein. The model slightly improves the

previous one (Capek & Sheehan 2001), describes a realistic system for which experimental results

violating the second law were announced, and fully supports the experimental conclusions (Sheehan

1995). All mathematical details are exposed, two independent types of mathematical arguments

are invoked, and no approximations that could be made responsible for the striking conclusions

are used. It shows how little the physics beyond the Second law is still understood.

INTRODUCTION

Challenges to the second law of thermodynamics [1, 2] are almost as old as the law itself,

dating back at least to the 1870’s with Maxwell’s celebrated demon [3, 4, 5, 6]. Most of

them have been resolved under close scrutiny [5, 7, 8] but some persisted. Anyway, strong

belief in old authorities and natural human tendency to organize things and facts into

closed logical units and complexes (scientiﬁc disciplines etc.) caused that almost nobody

doubts about validity of standard thermodynamics, in particular the Second law, in at least

the macroworld [9, 10]. Absolutistic statements like ‘...No exception to the second law of

thermodynamics has ever been found - not even a tiny one...’

[10] often appear and the

second law is almost universally believed to be unquestionable. In our opinion, the situation

is (perhaps still) not so clear. The reason is that experiments questioning the second law

have been reported since 1995, have since been subject to a public discussion but remain so

far unquestioned [11, 12].

In theory, arguments independent of these experiments appeared since 1997 [13] saying

that in quantum systems with strong or at least intermediate coupling to its surroundings

(identical or connected with usual thermodynamic baths) with mutual strong correlations

(entanglement), the standard statistical thermodynamics could be violated. This is in par-

ticular, but not only, the case of the second law of thermodynamics. One must keep in mind

that from ﬁrst principles (microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics), derivations the second law

are declared to exist just in classical (in the sense of non-quantum) physics [14] or, as in

standard textbooks, involving assumption of a weak system-bath coupling only. 1 It should

be stressed already here that the classical physics is, according to the Bohr correspondence

principle, an inﬁnite temperature limit of the (more general) quantum physics. This, inter

alia, implies that its application to ﬁnite temperatures as in standard thermodynamics is at

least open to discussion. The above lack of general derivation of the second law beyond the

classical regime could also correspond to the fact that so far reported and seemingly classical

paradoxes connected with the second law (see, e.g., [15]) usually involve suﬃciently intense

processes that are inherently of the quantum character.

1 Gibbs canonical form of the system density matrix compatible with the standard thermodynamics is
correct to just the zeroth order in the system-bath coupling. This is an important fact to be realized
already here as the eﬀect reported below is of higher order in this coupling.

2

In 1999,

it was realized that a long lasting call

in chemistry for inclusion of self-

organizational tendencies into theory of particle-transfer chemical reactions is, from the

microscopic point of view, nothing but a call for inclusion of such mechanisms that can turn

any (from the thermodynamical point of view) passive bath into an active one, opening thus

door to violations of standard thermodynamic principles [16]. Recent review of theoretical

models and state-of-art in theory could be found in, e.g., [17, 18]. So far, two main groups of

theoretical models of purely quantum open systems violating the second law existed: Those

with quantum reaction channels opening or closing in accordance with the instantaneous

state of the system (reminding of the Maxwell demon [3] closing and opening gate in a

wall separating two compartments with a classical gas), and those where a speciﬁc type

of interference of diﬀerent quantum reaction channels exists [17].

In particular this type

of systems is relevant as the contradiction with the second law treated in [17] is not only

mathematically well justiﬁed but can be given even a very simple physical interpretation

based on otherwise experimentally well established facts: This is the on-energy-shell (i.e.

induced by elastic transfer mechanisms) diﬀusion of excitons among tails of exciton local

levels broadened by ﬁnite-life-time eﬀects. This diﬀusion goes, as it is always the case of

diﬀusion in experiment, prevailingly to exciton sites with lower exciton population that may

be due to higher exciton excitation energy. Thus, the exciton ﬂow bearing energy can go

even against moderate temperature steps preserving such a population inequality between

(among) exciton localized states (sites).

Recently, as a theoretical response to another positively tested experimental system [11],

a next model of still another type has been suggested [19] that also allows rigorous solution

(exact within a scaling theory) fully conﬁrming experimental doubts about universal validity

of the second law. Detailed discussion and solution of a modiﬁed (and nearer to reality)

version of the model is the subject of the present paper. What is perhaps universal for

all the models challenging thermodynamics is that the system in question must be, during

its activity, outside the canonical state. Mechanisms how to achieve and maintain that

might be, of course, diﬀerent. One should understand, however, that this condition is

perhaps necessary but by far not suﬃcient. For other paradoxical systems that could be

also classiﬁed as above, showing how physics beyond the second law is still little understood

see, e.g., [15, 20].

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

We should like to stress that we shall, except for model assumptions, use no approximate

steps in our reasoning. This will certainly make position of our potential opponents more

diﬃcult. Moreover, mathematics we are going to use in the main text is that one by Davies

[24, 25] which then forms, for one speciﬁc choice of the scaling parameter, mathematical

basis of the weak-coupling kinetic relaxation theory conﬁrming, for the weak-coupling limit,

validity of the second law. (Another possibility of deriving basic kinetic equations (11) be-

low may be connected with the Tokuyama - Mori identity stemming from the Heisenberg

equations of motion for quantum operators - see, for another model, e.g.

[18].) We fully

rely upon the Davies mathematics and use, for the chosen model (i.e. a speciﬁc case) no

additional approximations. Hence, rigour of our approach below is that one of the general

Davies theory. We only deviate from a subsequent standard application of general Davies

theorems to the weak coupling situation by just another, but equally admissable and phys-

ically motivated, choice of the scaling parameter. This choice makes the theory physically

applicable also beyond the weak coupling limit. In the Appendix, we shall even avoid scaling

arguments at all. In both cases, as we have numerically veriﬁed and as it is also argued be-

low, our results well coincide with those of the weak-coupling theories in the overlap region

with the weak-coupling regime. We thus have no doubts on the validity of the second law

there. However, beyond the weak coupling regime, our results become appreciably diﬀerent

from standard ones. Physically, we have reasons supported by arguments to understand

that: This is a deviation from the canonical state of the system caused by its non-negligible

coupling to the bath. As far as the underlying Davies mathematics is concerned, it is gen-

eral (valid for any choice of the scaling parameter) and cannot be consequently sometimes

correct and sometimes not. It can be either correct or not in general; no other alternative

exists. The ﬁrst alternative provides solid basis for arguments in favour of correctness of

our approach while the second one (that was even never suggested or indicated) deprives

even the weak coupling relaxation theory of its mathematical foundation. Rejecting these

alternatives would

•

either mean to question physical as well as mathematical principles (including the Li-

ouville equation) on which all the existing renown of description of kinetic phenomena

via corresponding kinetic equations (depending on the regime in question) relies,

4

or to admit that the very principles of quantum mechanics of the open system would

•

have to be complemented by, e.g., some additional requirements not admitting models

of the type investigated here.

In view of existing experimental evidence in favour of the quantum theory as well as because

of experimental results indicating violations of the second law in experiment [11, 21, 22, 23],

both the latter possibilities seem, in our opinion, rather unlikely. In any case, the conclusions

suggest that there is at least something in physics beyond the second law what is at present

still insuﬃciently understood.

Our system, in accordance with the experimental system [11], is assumed to consist of

three sites, designated as 1, 2, and 3. The reader is referred to [11] or [19] if he/she is

interested in the motivation for construction of the model. The latter is, as compared to

[19], only slightly modiﬁed here so that it now better corresponds to the experimental system

of [11]. Shortly, the above sites correspond to walls of the plasma container, plasma, and

the probe. Hamiltonian of the system reads

HS =

jaj + J(a†

1a2 + a†

2a1) + K(a†

2a3 + a†

3a2),

(1)

3

j=2
X

where the zero of the energy is taken to be at the walls (site 1). Though it is not in principle

important, we assume here ǫ3 > ǫ2 > 0. We assume only one electron in the system that

is elastically transferred between sites 1 and 2, and simultaneously between sites 2 and 3.

This is in accordance with, e.g., the standard theory of the Richardson-Dushman thermal

emission (for the 1 - 2, i.e. wall - plasma transfers) that is based on the idea of prevailingly

elastic transfer upon, e.g., electron leaving surface of solids.

The load between the probe and walls in the Sheehan’s experimental set-up [11] is the

location at which the electron can inelastically scatter. This means, in our case, phonon-

assisted 3

1 transitions. The phonons involved are assumed to be those of the load, here

↔

designated as bath II. In addition to that, we assume another bath, say bath I, formed by

phonons (physically, those from the walls) interacting site-locally with the electron located

on site 1. This means that Hamiltonian HB of the bath of our model reads as

(3)

S−B could be turned below to just a temperature-

dependent renormalization of site-energy ǫ1 of site 1 that we set zero here.) Here the anti-

or commutational relations between creation and annihilation operators for electrons and

phonons are as usual. Also N designates the number of phonon modes; here it is understood

that N

+

. Notice that H I

S−B is quadratic in the phonon operators; this is certainly

→

∞

admissable but contrasts with both tradition and the treatment of phonon operators in

H II

S−B. This non-standard assumption is employed to preserve the ﬁnite dephasing and local

electron heating after the Davies scaling procedure (preserving formally just the lowest-

order eﬀects in the scaling parameter) which now follows. Otherwise, we would have to

involve higher-order eﬀects in treating the dephasing what could make the theory and the

ﬁnal statements, in eyes of a sceptic reader, rather ambiguous.

In any case, we have a

freedom to choose the model as above. Concerning H I

S−B, one should also notice that the

on-site dephasing is here, in contrast to the model from [19], on site 1. This corresponds, in

the experimentally tested system of [11], to electron heating inside the walls of the plasma

container.

One should ﬁrst of all realize that the phonon-assisted transfers 3

H II

S−B enable the electron to move in a circle 1

These two circular motions cannot, however, compensate each other. This is the ﬁrst of

two basic physical observations on which the present model relies. The point is that all

the inter-site transfers involved are elastic, i.e. symmetric, except for the 3

1 one. Such

elastic transfers lead to a tendency of equilibration of site occupation probabilities. For

↔

instance, assume for a while that we had only a dimer composed of sites 1 and 2, with
the coherent (i.e. elastic) hopping term J(a†
Hamiltonian reads then HS = ǫ†

1a2 + H.C.) as above. Stationarity of the solution

2a1) decoupled from any bath. The

2a2 + J(a†

1a2 + a†

we are interested in implies ρ12 = ρ21. Contingently nonzero values of these site-oﬀ-diagonal

elements are connected with a 1-2 bonding. If we add a mechanism breaking such bonds (but,

6

for simplicity, causing no additional 1

2 transfer), magnitude of ρ12 = ρ21 would become

↔

suppressed below their maximum value given by positive semi-deﬁniteness of ρ. Concerning

the site-diagonal elements ρjj, their stationary values can be investigated by generalized

master equations where memory functions determine the 1

2 balance. These memory

functions (and also their time integrals whose ratio determines ρ11(+

)/ρ22(+

)) contain

two channels [26], sometimes interpreted as phonon- (or bath-) assisted and quasicoherent

↔

one [27]. The latter channel is, in contrast to the former one, symmetric what is the reason

of generally comparable stationary values of ρ11(+

) and ρ22(+

). Full equilibration

ρ11(+

) = ρ22(+

) then follows from our mathematics below upon full ignoring site 3, as

∞

∞

a consequence of elastic character of the 1

2 transitions. The same applies for dimer 2

↔
and 3 once it is separated from the rest of the system. These facts will be useful below.

With that, it is then easy to show that the equality of populations ρ11 = ρ33 stemming from

above reasoning based on the elastic character of the J- and K-induced elastic transfers

cannot comply with equilibration of the inelastic phonon-assisted transitions 3
ρ11 > ρ33 or possibly even to ρ11 ≫
obtained below. A word of warning is, however, worth already here: What is here now being

ρ33. This fact will be useful to understand the results

1 leading

↔

explained are still just heuristic arguments supported by previous investigations that explain

our motivation; true rigorous mathematics comes only below. As it follows from general

arguments above as well as the mathematics of the next sections, we do understand why,

e.g., the detailed balance conditions could in our system become violated. This is because

these conditions do not apply to uphill or downhill transfers caused by elastic mechanisms.

We, however, do not raise the question about violations or preserving these conditions here.

Our rigorous mathematics below avoids such statements and formulations, and leads directly

to the required results and eﬀects investigated here.

For that, let us return to our model (1-3). Between sites 1 and 3, there is an imbal-

ance mechanism owing to spontaneous processes allowed by H II

S−B that prefers, because

of assumed ǫ3 > 0, the 3

1 transitions to 1

3 ones. This is the imbalance (and

→

the only imbalance existing in our system) that makes domination of the circular motion

phonon absorption. If the former transfers prevail, we get the net heat ﬂow to bath II.)

The question is, however, where this heat could come from. The only possible answer is

that it is from bath I. Really, dephasing at site 1 means nothing but a continuous emission

and absorption of phonons from bath I that can provide the necessary energy transferred

by the electron whose energy is not sharp. Simultaneously, this dephasing can break phase

relations between amplitude of ﬁnding the electron at site 1 and those elsewhere, i.e.

it

breaks the corresponding covalent-type of bonds. Without the suﬃciently strong dephas-

ing, the electron distribution in the system (as prescribed by, e.g., the canonical density

matrix to which the density matrix usually tends within weak-coupling theories considering

coupling to bath as inﬁnitesimally weak) would really contain such and fully developed J-

and K-induced bonds. Thus, it would be stiﬀ enough in the respect that irrespective of the

above imbalance, no electron circular motion would ﬁnally appear. One can easily verify

that by calculating, e.g., the electron ﬂow between any two sites. We always get (by the

way, in a correspondence with standard physical reasoning) zero mean ﬂow in the canon-

ical (i.e. zeroth-order in the coupling to the bath) state of the system. From this point

of view, lack of on-site amplitude dephasing (or, in other words, that of partial violations

of such covalent bonds re-appearing immediately once the system coupling to the bath is

re-introduced as a source of corrections to the canonical form of its density matrix) is one of

the greatest deﬁciencies of the weak-coupling kinetic approaches leading to such canonical

distributions. For illustration, notice that site oﬀ-diagonal elements of the density matrix

become, in the weak-coupling kinetic theories, asymptotically independent of the strength of

the site-local coupling to the bath even when this type of the coupling causes bath-induced

(and on diﬀerent sites uncorrelated) ﬂuctuations of site energies (see, e.g., formula (28) of

[28]). So, even when the model does describe it, its weak-coupling kinetic relaxation formal-

ism is in principle unable to describe the dephasing and breaking of the bonds. Hence, in

our case here, we must deﬁnitely go beyond the weak coupling kinetic theory in especially

the dephasing rate at site 1. This is the second basic and, perhaps, the most important

observation connected with the model and the eﬀect we should like to describe here. (One

could also pose a question why we should be so keen to describe and include such potentially

weak corrections to, e.g. violations of covalent 1

2 and 2

3 bonds here. The point is

−

−

that these violations provide perhaps just small corrections to the canonical density matrix

of the system but, simultaneously, these corrections are the very source of the eﬀect we are

8

interested in.) One should add that in our approach involving other than the weak coupling

scaling below, we also take the limit of the inﬁnitesimal coupling to bath, i.e. inﬁnitesimal

dephasing. On the other hand, we simultaneously scale also the hopping (transfer) integrals

what makes the ratio of the in-phasing and dephasing constant. This, in contract to the

standard weak coupling scaling, corresponds to reality and allows the above bond breaking.

Thus we have a hope, and really do obtain below the eﬀect expected. So far, of course, all

these ideas provide us with at most a physical background of the model, its mathematical

treatment, and physics beyond. So, let us now have a look at how these ideas work within

a rigorous theory.

III. DAVIES SCALING AND KINETIC EQUATIONS

The scaling procedure we use is based on Davies [24, 25]. (Another type of arguments,

which is fully non-scaling though it is technically tightly connected with our scaling approach

here, may be found in the Appendix.) We, however, extend our treatment beyond standard

weak coupling theory in that we scale not only time and HS−B, but also the transfer (overlap,

hopping, or resonance) integrals J and K, setting [29]

t = t′/λ2, HS−B

λ,

J

λ2, K

λ2

∝

∝

∝

(4)

(t′ playing the role of a new rescaled time.) As usual, we then project oﬀ the bath and

let λ

0. Such a physical regime where intersite hopping (transfer) integrals determining

→

rates of bath-free transfers inside system get comparable with rates of bath-assisted processes

(transfers) can be deﬁnitely not that of the weak coupling but rather that of the intermediate

or, in a sense, even contingently strong coupling to the bath. Technically, though the

mathematics used is completely that by Davies [24], we proceed simultaneously according

to [29] where the relevant formulae are rewritten in a physically understandable form.

The Davies formalism starts by writing total Hamiltonian

in form

Here, one should add that λH1 ∝
includes also higher orders in λ (λ2 if (4) is accepted). Those who do not like this way of

λ but that does not exclude the possibility that λH1

H = HS + HB + HS−B

H = H0 + λH1.

thinking could replace conditions J

λ2 in (4) by J

below. The ﬁnal result is the same.

Next, introduce superoperators

This general and exact result should now be speciﬁed according to the choice of H0 and λH1

in (6).

Two main possibilities exist.

Either we accept so called weak-coupling scaling according to van Hove (and often

automatically accepted in general situations)

t = t′/λ2, HS−B

λ,

J = const, K = const

(again with λ

0) which would correspond to the choice

→

H0 = HS + HB,

λH1 = HS−B.

(12)

(13)

Then λ2

K

in (11) is nothing but the weak-coupling relaxation superoperator and (11)

reduces to the Redﬁeld equation (before using the Redﬁeld secular approximation)

[30, 31, 32]. The relaxation is then to the canonical state of the system.

Then several things have to be realized:

– Though the relaxation superoperator λ2

K

formally also higher orders in λ, application of the rule TrB([a†

[a†

– Because now

what is a free propagation among eigenstates of the full (site-oﬀ-diagonal) HS.

This competition between site-local and site oﬀ-local tendencies of the time de-

velopment is what makes the dynamics much richer than in the weak-coupling

case.

– The fact that λ2

describes relaxation in the site-local basis is not owing to

K

neglecting anything or any type of approximation. It is owing to choice of another

regime; in our case that one in which J- and K-induced processes become at most

comparable with those caused by the system interaction with the bath.

11

Those who anyway do not like our identiﬁcation (14) could start from (8) with the

standard identiﬁcation (13) and invoke then the identity

(15)

that is based on the assumption that both J and K are

λ2. The observation that

∝

J=K=0 is then nothing but the relaxation superoperator as obtained from our

λ2

K|

choice (14) again implies that

– (11) with the relaxation superoperator yielding relaxation among site-local eigen-

states of HS

J=K=0 is a proper choice for describing time-develoment of ρ(t) in the

|

regime where the bath-induced processes in the system are at least comparable

with those inside the system alone (J- and K-induced particle transfer), and

– that this choice of the relaxation superoperator cannot be questioned on grounds

of formal objections against our (physically motivated) choice (14).

This all justiﬁes our choice of (non-Redﬁeld) form of λ2

relaxation superoperator yield-

K

ing relaxation among site-local states. On the other hand, identity (15) may be also formally

viewed as a reconciliation of two diﬀerent scalings that give, in the extreme limit of zero

scaling parameter λ, identical results. In other words, as if we were trying to say ‘...does not

matter which form of the relaxation tensor, site-local or non-local, we take...’. This state-

ment is, however, not true. The situation reminds that of the Redﬁeld theory without and

with the Redﬁeld secular approximation [30, 31]. Both these approaches correspond to the

standard choice (13) but with two diﬀerent Davies forms of the relaxation tensor (Theorem

1.2 of [24] as compared with the second form in Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 of [33]). Theorem

1.4 of [24] establishes what is considered to be a full and complete equivalence of the theory

without and with the Redﬁeld secular approximation (compare discussion in [29]). This

equivalence means, however, just equivalence in the strict and complete λ

0 limit.

It

is, on the other hand, known that all coupling constants are in physics ﬁnite and it is also

correspondingly well known and established that for any ﬁnite value of λ, the two schemes

(without and with the Redﬁeld secular approximation) diﬀer (with increasing λ even) appre-

ciably [34, 35]. So physics must always be in such (mathematically unresolved) situations

taken into account. (The problem is not in an impossibility to solve the mathematically

well posed problem, but in the fact that mathematics gives answer regarding just the λ

0

→

12

limit while physics concerns the situations where λ remains ﬁnite.) Here, concerning the

schemes with the site-local and site non-local forms of the relaxation superoperator, we use

formally the same general form of the relaxation superoperator (tensor) (corresponding to

Theorem 1.2 of [24]) but use another (than usual) scaling scheme (not (13) but rather (4)).

Equation (15) implies that in the strict λ

0 limit and ﬁnite interval of times t′, it does

→

not matter which way, i.e. site-local or oﬀ-local form of the relaxation superoperator we

use. However, we again know that all coupling constants in Nature are ﬁnite. That is why

for ﬁnite λ, the two schemes may diﬀer even appreciably. So, again as with the problem

of correspondence between Redﬁeld schemes without and with the Redﬁeld secular approx-

imation, rather physical arguments should be invoked. Additional and, in our opinion, the

decisive mathematical argument can be found in the Appendix.

The physical argument in favour of the form of the relaxation superoperator corresponding

to the choice (14) is that we are interested in the regime in which the bath-assisted processes

inside the system are at least comparable with, or even dominating over the internal transfer

processes inside the system caused, in our case, by the J- and K-dependent hopping terms

in HS (1). Once we realize that the weak-coupling theory presumes, in the sense of (12), the

system-bath coupling to be inﬁnitesimal, i.e. inﬁnitely times weaker than all other relevant

competing transfer and relaxation mechanisms, this excludes scaling (12), i.e. the choice

(13), in the regime considered here. On the other hand, it allows to use (4), i.e. the choice

(14). That is why we shall below stick to this alternative. So, we use

from (8) with (14) for

our model (1-3). This means the Redﬁeld form of

in the localized basis as a consequence

K

K

of another (than the weak-coupling) physical regime, i.e. also correspondingly another form

of identiﬁcation of perturbation. So, this form of the Redﬁeld tensor is deﬁnitely not any

consequence of any additional approximation applied to the Redﬁeld form of the relaxation

superoperator in the weak-coupling regime (for discussion of such an approximation in the

weak-coupling regime see [36]). After some straightforward algebra, (11) then turns in the

latter involves a 1 + nB term, whereas the former has only nB. Physically, this corresponds

to Γ↑ involving only bath-assisted stimulated up-hill transitions (absorption), whereas Γ↓

involves both bath-assisted spontaneous and bath-assisted stimulated down-hill transitions

(emission). Finally, 2Γ determines the rate of dephasing arising from local electron-energy

ﬂuctuations from Bath I, and also the rate of electron heating in the walls (site 1).

A few comments are worth mentioning already here. First, notice that temperature TI

of bath I enters (16) only via the dephasing (and simultaneously heating) rate 2Γ. This

rate depends, however, also on strength and details of the electron coupling to bath I.

Thus, moderate changes of TI may be well compensated by those of the coupling and vice

versa. As there are no abrupt qualitative changes expected with moderate changes of the

coupling, only continuous changes of, e.g., the electron 1

3 ﬂow are expected

important for interpretation of the result to be obtained below. Finally, concerning (the

statistical mechanics [14]. On the other hand, the low-temperature limitation (19) is not

IV. ANALYTICAL SOLUTION AND STEADY-STATE HEAT-FLOW

Let us henceforth investigate the stationary situation. Then the left hand side of (16)

equals zero so that we have a homogeneous set of 9 linear algebraic equations for the sta-

tionary values of the electron density matrix. The matrix rank is, however, only 8 since the

sum of its ﬁrst three rows is zero. Thus, the set can (and must) be complemented by the

normalization condition

ρ11 + ρ22 + ρ33 = 1.

(20)

This provides us with a complete inhomogeneous set of 9 linear algebraic equations for

9 elements of the particle density matrix. The site-diagonal matrix elements ρjj give the

probabilities of ﬁnding the electron at site j. Full algebraic solution of this set of equations is

possible but unwieldy. That is why the set will be solved numerically below. First, however,

we shall analytically prove that there is always, for nonzero temperatures TI and TII, a

positive electron ﬂow 1

1 implying, for TI < TII, violation of the second law

of thermodynamics in its Clausius formulation. The proof is made by logical contradiction.

We stress from the outset that the mathematical derivation of our starting equations (16),

including scaling, involves no approximation; therefore, aside from the model assumptions,

our treatment here is fully rigorous, in the full mathematical meaning of the word.

Cyclic mean electron ﬂow in the system (taken as positive in the direction 1

These formulae can be also easily derived from elementary quantum mechanics. Assume

now that no heat ﬂows directly from bath I to bath II and vice versa. So, only the electron-

mediated heat ﬂow from I to II may appear. Since the 3

are associated with inﬂux or eﬄux of energy (heat) to or from Bath II (proportionally to

the magnitude of ǫ3), the total mean heat ﬂow from Bath I to Bath II may be written as

Since ǫ3 > 0, this implies, via (21) and (23), that

The reader could easily recognize that (25) is nothing but a detailed balance condition for

On the other hand, from (33) and (35), we get that in the stationary state

One should realize that conditions (37) and ρ12 = ρ21 (see (36)) obtained so far fully corre-

spond to what has been said above about no-ﬂow equilibrium inside the dimer ‘1 - 2’.

The eighth or ninth equation of (16) yield, in the stationary state and with the help of

(36),

Together with (20) and (25), it provides an inhomogeneous set of three linear algebraic

equations determining the site occupation probabilities (all the time provided that the no-

ﬂow condition (24) used above applies). The solution reads

ρ11 =

Γ↓ + 2Γ↑

ρ22 = ρ33 =

Γ↑
Γ↓ + 2Γ↑

.

This result, on the other hand, contradicts (37). This is the required contradiction implying

that (24) cannot be correct. One can also ask what is the reason for the contradiction.
Clearly, (37) would be satisﬁed by (39) if there were Γ↓ −
mean to disregard the spontaneous processes that are responsible for the diﬀerence on the

Γ↑ = 0. That would, however,

left hand side. The spontaneous processes are, however, purely quantum. Similarly, one

can easily observe that (39) becomes fully compatible with (37) in the limit of the inﬁnite

temperature TII

+

. The inﬁnite temperature limit means, however, the classical limit

→

∞

(the Bohr correspondence principle). All that is why we can understand the violation of the

second law we arrive at below (as well as in other models yielding such a striking conclusion

- see above) as a consequence of quantum eﬀects.

18

So, there is always an electron circular ﬂow in the system implying (not in general but)

in our speciﬁc situation nonzero heat transfer

(as given by (23) and (21) or (22)) between

Q
baths I and II. The last questions to be solved before we resort to a numerical study are

what is its orientation and how the conclusion contradicts the second law.

V. VIOLATION OF THE SECOND LAW

In order to infer what is the orientation of the mean heat ﬂow, let us turn to above

formulae (21) and (23). From (23) we get that signs of

and

coincide (ǫ3 > 0). As for

Q

J

the latter, we remind that ρ33 is always (as a site occupation probability) positive and that

Γ↑ disappears for TII

0. Thus, from (21), we get that

is, in the low temperature limit

→

of bath II but arbitrary nonzero TI, always positive. This is, by the way, also what our

numerical results show.

Let us now increase TII. One should realize that

is a continuous function of TII and

never turns to zero. (For that, see the above proof.) So it should remain positive even when

TII becomes greater than TI. (In fact, owing to intermixture of TI with details of coupling
to bath I in H I

S−B inside Γ, nothing can happen at the moment when TII passes TI. This

fact was also conﬁrmed numerically.) Positive values of

mean, however, a positive rate

of heat transfer from bath I to bath II which thus goes, for TI < TII, against temperature

step. As the heat transfer is spontaneous (there is no external expenditure of energy or

whatever else conditioning this transfer), this conclusion explicitly contradicts the Clausius

form of the second law [2] stating that such processes are impossible. On the other hand,

the conclusion obtained analytically here (and veriﬁed numerically below) that the second

law is in our system really violated fully corresponds to conclusions of [11] where, for an

experimental plasma system corresponding to the above model, the universal validity of the

second law was ﬁrst seriously challenged.

to prove that the heat transfer really turns to zero in the limit of zero temperature TI of

bath I. This is what must be expected physically because in such a limit, there is no heat

available in bath I to be transferred to bath II. In just other words: There is no dephasing

in this limit between sites 1 and 2. So, the covalent bond 1-2 should become perfect, making

thus the electron (and consequently also the heat) ﬂow impossible.

Slight increase as well as decrease with TII are both possible. This may be interpreted

VII. CONCLUSION

We have obtained a spontaneous heat ﬂow between two macroscopic baths that is owing

to a speciﬁc activity of our microscopic single-electron system not aided from outside. So,

starting from rigorous mathematics of the quantum theory of open systems, a contradic-

tion with the second law of thermodynamics has been obtained for the model in question.

Remind that except for model assumptions, no approximations were made that could be

made responsible for the eﬀect, and that the model corresponds to an experimental system

positively tested in [11]. This indicates that one should choose between just two alternatives:

•

•

There is still something hidden in physics beyond the second law what is at present

not fully understood. This possibility might also mean complementing contemporary

quantum mechanics and present philosophy of quantum-mechanical modelling, to rec-

oncile the quantum theory with (presumably) universally valid thermodynamics.

The second alternative is to refrain from so far universally assumed validity of thermo-

dynamics in the macroworld. One should realize that though our system is microscopic,

appending the reservoirs turn the physics to the macroscopic one.

IX. APPENDIX

A. Derivation of basic kinetic equation from the Nakajima-Zwanzig identity

Scaling procedures of the above type are always an intricate and mathematically rigorous

way of justifying, irrespective of the type of the scaling parameter used, the lowest order

formulae in, e.g., kinetic equations. This does not mean, on the other hand, that such

theories rely upon a possibility to use perturbation theory. Above, we have argued why we

cannot apply the weak-coupling (to bath) scaling approach in our case. The reasons are:

•

•

Its ability to include the bath-induced dephasing in the equations for the density matrix

of the system but, simultaneously, its inability to incorporate, in the asymptotic time

domain, its the eﬀect on the solution, in particular on the site oﬀ-diagonal elements

of ρ. 2 This dephasing is crucial for the eﬀects investigated here as it conditions the

existence of ﬂows in our system.

Its justiﬁcation in just the regime where the bath-induced processes in the system

are appreciably slower than all internal competing processes inside the system alone.

However, we are here, in contrast to that, interested in situations where such processes

are at least commensurable.

So we must refrain from the usual scaling (12) connected with identiﬁcation (13) and use

instead scaling (4) corresponding to choice (14). With that, one can start from, e.g., the

2 One should realize that also, e.g., the Boltzmann equation includes the lowest-order scattering processes
but its solution, e.g. the Fermi-Dirac distribution, is fully independent of details of the scattering and is
correct to just its zeroth order.

B. Violations of the second law without scaling arguments

Arguments in favour of violation of the second law as reported above critically depend on

the existence of the heat ﬂow from bath I to bath II, i.e. on the existence of the electron mean

circular ﬂow

. Existence of the ﬂow has been above proved using scaling which does not

J

belong to a generally accepted weaponry in kinetic theories. Moreover, one could ask about

justiﬁcation to use such a (as well as any other) kinetic approach beyond limits of the kinetic

regime. (Notice, e.g., that constant a in ... sup0≤λ2t≤a ... in (8) is always ﬁnite.) That is why,

technically using the above formulae, arguments in favour of existence of nonzero values of

J
are given below that do not rely on scaling arguments employed above. Though we insist that

the above arguments are mathematically rigorous (i.e. that the above treatment is free of

any additional approximations imposed on the assumed model), the treatment below is even

more straightforward. One should add that, in our opinion, the only acceptable potential

objection to all kinetic treatments (including those connected with the weak-coupling scaling

like theories based on the Boltzmann or Pauli equations) is that they might become dubious

in the very-long-time asymptotics. As standard practice with, e.g., the Boltzmann theory in

the dc limit shows, this may rather concern the asymptotic way of approaching stationary

states than the very form of the asymptotic distributions which is currently reproduced in

accordance with standard equilibrium statistical physics. The treatment below is resistive

even against such objections as it assumes, as experiments require, taking ﬁrst the dc limit.

Only then (if at all) discussion based on smallness of individual terms in the Hamiltonian

(coupling constants etc.) comes into question.

In the Schr¨odinger picture, the Nakajima-Zwanzig identity (40) reads [37, 38]

take the inﬁnite (thermodynamic) limit of the bath(s) (designated as Lim below) and let

time t increase to inﬁnity. In the full long-time domain we are here interested in, relaxation

to stationary state of the system takes place, i.e. not the interaction-picture density matrix

of the system ˜ρ(t) but the Schr¨odinger picture density matrix ρ(t) becomes stationary.

Our set (47) (with (48-49)) should now be solved by the Kramer rule and the result should

then be put into (22) to check whether the electron circular ﬂow

and, consequently, also

the heat transfer

are nonzero in the stationary situation or not 3. One should stress here

J

Q

that formula (22) is [in contrast to (21)] independent of the above scaling treatment, fully

corresponds to the standard electron ﬂow formula of the quantum mechanics, and may also
be easily derived from, e.g., the population balance d

.

All the formulae now become totally unwieldy and, in addition to it, there are big technical

problems with calculation of Wmn,pq coeﬃcients. So, we shall limit here to what is for our

3 See [39] for the case that the Kramer rule yields uncertain expression of the type ‘0/0’.

26

purposes suﬃcient. This is discussion of limiting situations which allows, owing to continuous

dependence of solutions of inhomogeneous sets of linear algebraic equations on its coeﬃcients

and also that of the latter coeﬃcients on the parameters of our model, at least qualitative

statements we need.

Weak-coupling limit: In contrast to standard practice of kinetic equations but fully in

accordance with what experiment requires, we take here the limit of weak-coupling to

bath HS−B only after taking the dc limit. (Remember that in experiment, frequency

may be set arbitrarily low, or time may be taken arbitrarily large. On the other hand,

all coupling constants including that of HS−B are in Nature always ﬁnite though

possibly small. That is why, e.g., they could be set small in asymptotic expansions

only, if at all, i.e. after performing the dc limit as we do here.) Performing the second-

order (in HS−B coupling) expansion of Wmn,pq allows to express them in an explicit

form. The latter, however, involves exact energies and exact eigenstates of HS that can

be made explicit in our three-site model only via Cardano formulae for solution of the

algebraic equations of the third order. (Notice that otherwise, HS cannot be explicitly

diagonalized.) That is why we shall refrain here from explicit formulae for the second-

order approximants W (2)

mn,pq of Wmn,pq. Replacing Wmn,pq by W (2)
one can as usual verify (as it also follows from arguments of standard equilibrium

mn,pq in (47), however,

statistical physics) that formally (invoking standard perturbational arguments)

(50)

In our case here, because of existence of two (say warmer and colder) baths, real

probabilities pι(βI, βII) have in general not the usual simple canonical form but another

more complicated one, involving both initial bath temperatures. They may also depend

on the relative ratio of the two terms in HS−B in (3) coupling the electron to baths I

and II, respectively. The states

are eigenstates of HS. What is important is that the

ι

leading ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (50) (i.e. the canonical density matrix in the

case when βI = βII) represents ρ just in the zeroth order in the coupling to the bath.

To this order, in our real basis of localized states (sites)

, m = 1, 2, 3, ρ12 = ρ∗
21

m
i

|

becomes thus, according to (50), real in the weak-coupling limit. Thus, according to

(22), there should be no electron ﬂow and, consequently, also no electron-mediated

heat transfer between our bath. Thus, no contradiction with the second law appears

27

in the zeroth order in the coupling to the bath. This is fully in accordance with the

standard weak-coupling kinetic theory. On the other hand, for general situation, this

conclusion valid only in the extreme weak-coupling limit means practically nothing.

The point is that the eﬀect we are looking for may appear just when corrections to the

lowest (zeroth) order form of ρ in (50) implying, inter alia, perturbations of otherwise

stiﬀ intersite covalent bonds get included. In order to convince the reader, we come

to more general considerations.

Outside the weak-coupling limit: For simplicity, let us set K = J in what follows here.

Apart from other parameters, the ﬂow (22) thus depends, via the solution to (47), on

both J and the system-bath coupling constant, say λ. As far as we accept J = c

we can, allowing λ to approach zero, move to zero in the J-λ plane along many routes

according to choice of the constant c.

[One should compare the approach with (4);

here, however, we have already turned, as one in fact should as argued above, our

time t to inﬁnity.] Let us remind the reader that the above weak-coupling case would

correspond to approaching arbitrary point outside origin on the J axis and only then,

if at all, to approach origin along the J-axis. The fact that we got zero electron ﬂow

in such a limit indicates nothing for a general case, in the same way as the fact that

λ2,

·

(51)

−

and zero small-x expansion (asymptotics) of g(x) = limy→0x2y2 = 0 does not imply
that f (x, y) = x2y2 equals to zero in the x

y plane. Nonzero values of f (x, y) in

the vicinity of origin x = y = 0 may be, however, seen from the fact that on, e.g.,

the parabola y = λ, x = c

λ2, we get nonzero asymptotics of f

·

λ→0 d

λ6 with

≈

·

nonzero proportionality constant d. By calculating such an asymptotics is how we

shall proceed now.

Let us expand now, taking into account J

λ2 and HS−B

λ, coeﬃcients Wmn,pq

∝

∝

in (47) to the second order in λ. For the lowest-order approximants for the ρmn

elements, one in fact obtains, after a long but straightforward algebra, exactly the

same set of equations as obtained above from (16) by setting the left hand side zero

and replacing the ﬁrst equation by (20). This set has already been treated in detail,

both analytically and numerically, above. So we can directly use the results.

In

28

particular, from this set, we obtain as above proper (small-λ) asymptotics of ρmn with

(for correspondingly nonzero though at least suﬃciently small λ) nonzero values of

the ﬂow in (22). Accordingly, we also obtain like above nonzero values of heat ﬂow

Q
in (23) implying, for TI < TII, violations of the second law. Hence, in general points

around origin in the J

K vs. λ plane and except for coordinate axes corresponding

≡

to exactly zero hopping integrals J = K = 0 or zero order in the coupling to the bath

(when (50) implies the canonical form of ρ), the second law of thermodynamics cannot

be in general preserved. This is in a full accord with our result in the main text.

One should again stress that this method allows to avoid the scaling arguments at all and is

more honest as compared to experiment by ﬁrst turning the time to inﬁnity and only then

investigating the proper asymptotics for the heat transfer between our two baths.

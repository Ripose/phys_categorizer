A comparison of turbulent diﬀusion and pair-dispersion in homogeneous, macroscopically isotropic
Navier-Stokes (NS) and nonhelical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence based on high-
resolution direct numerical simulations is presented. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences between MHD and NS
systems are observed in the pair-dispersion properties, in particular a strong reduction of the sepa-
ration velocity in MHD turbulence as compared to the NS case. It is shown that in MHD turbulence
the average pair-dispersion is slowed down for τd . t . 10τd, τd being the Kolmogorov time, due
to the alignment of the relative Lagrangian tracer velocity with the local magnetic ﬁeld. Signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerences in turbulent single-particle diﬀusion in NS and MHD turbulence are not detected.
The ﬂuid particle trajectories in the vicinity of the smallest dissipative structures are found to be
characterisically diﬀerent although these comparably rare events have a negligible inﬂuence on the
statistics investigated in this work.

The diﬀusive eﬀect of turbulence on contaminants passively advected by the ﬂow is of great practical and fundamen-
tal interest. While the study of passive scalars [1] usually reverts to the Eulerian description of the ﬂow, the Lagrangian
point of view has proven to be very fruitful regarding investigations of turbulent diﬀusion and pair-dispersion [2, 3]
as well as for the fundamental understanding of turbulence [4]. The three-dimensional dynamics of passive tracers
[5, 6, 7]) and numerical, e.g.
in neutral ﬂuids has been subject of various experimental (for recent works see e.g.
[8, 9, 10, 11], investigations. Related problems regarding the turbulent diﬀusion of magnetic ﬁelds and the inﬂuence
of turbulent magnetic ﬁelds on particle diﬀusion have been studied extensively in space and astrophysics, see e.g.
[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], as well as in the context of magnetically conﬁned nuclear-fusion plasmas, see for example
[18, 19, 20].

This Letter reports a ﬁrst eﬀort to identify diﬀerences in the diﬀusion and dispersion properties of turbulent ﬂows
in electrically conducting and in neutral media. To this end the dynamics of ﬂuid particles is studied via high-
resolution direct numerical simulation of passive tracers immersed in ﬂuids that are described by the incompressible
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and the Navier-Stokes (NS) approximation.

Using the vorticity, ω = ∇ × v, and a uniform mass density, ρ0 = 1, the non-dimensional incompressible MHD

equations are given by

∂tω = ∇ × [v × ω − b × (∇ × b)] + µ∆ω
∂tb = ∇ × (v × b) + η∆b

∇ · v = ∇ · b = 0 .

The dimensionless molecular diﬀusivities of momentum and magnetic ﬁeld are denoted by µ and η, respectively. The
magnetic ﬁeld b is given in Alfv´en-speed units. The Navier-Stokes equations which govern the motion of an electrically
neutral ﬂuid are obtained by setting b ≡ 0 in Eqs. (1)-(3).

The MHD/Navier-Stokes equations are solved by a standard pseudospectral method in a triply periodic cube of
linear extent 2π. The velocity ﬁeld at the position X of a tracer particle is computed via tricubic polynomial
interpolation and then used to move the particle according to

˙X(t) ≡ V (t) = vintpol(X, t) .

Eq. 4 is solved by a midpoint method which is straightforwardly integrated into the leapfrog scheme that advances
the turbulent ﬁelds. Test calculations using Fourier interpolated ‘exact’ representations of turbulent velocity ﬁelds
have shown that the chosen tricubic polynomial interpolation delivers suﬃcient precision with a mean relative error at
5123 resolution of ∼ O(10−3). In addition tricubic interpolation is numerically much cheaper than the nonlocal spline
[21]), especially on computing architectures with distributed memory. The initial particle positions
approach (cf.
are forming tetrads that are spatially arranged to lie on a randomly deformed cubic super-grid with a maximum
perturbation of 25% per super-grid cell. This conﬁguration represents a compromise between statistical independence

of particle dynamics and a space-ﬁlling particle distribution (cf. [9, 22]). In addition well-deﬁned initial particle-pair
separations ∆0 (cf. Table I) are realized by the tetrad grouping.

Distances are given in units of the Kolmogorov dissipation length ℓd = (µ3/εK)1/4 deﬁned with the kinetic energy
dissipation rate εK that is part of the total dissipation rate ε = εK + εM = RV dV (µω2 + η(∇ × b)2). In this work
kmaxℓd ≈ 1.6. This fulﬁlls the widely accepted resolution criterion introduced in [8] and corresponds to a dissipative
energy fall-oﬀ of about 4 decades in the dissipation range avoiding interpolation problems at grid-scales. Intervals of
time are given in units of the large-eddy turnover time, T0 = π/(2E)1/2, E = EK + EM = RV dV (v2 + b2)/2 being
the total energy, or in multiples of the Kolmogorov time, τd = (ℓ2

d/εK)1/3, as appropriate.

The simulations are carried out using a resolution of 5123 collocation points with aliasing errors being treated by
spherical mode truncation [23]. Quasi-stationary turbulence is generated by a forcing which freezes all modes in the
sphere k ≤ kf = 2. The frozen modes which are taken from DNS decaying turbulence sustain the turbulence gently
via nonlinear interactions. It has been checked that this way of driving does not introduce signiﬁcant anisotropy by
regarding direction-dependent Eulerian two-point statistics.

Starting with a set of random ﬂuctuations of v (and b in the MHD case) with zero mean the driven ﬂows reach
quasi-stationary states during which the total energy E shows ﬂuctuations . 10% around unity and EM/EK ≈ 2
(MHD). In both simulations the total energy dissipation rate ε is quasi-constant at about 0.24 with εM ≈ 0.15 in the
MHD case. The turbulent ﬁelds in the MHD system have negligible magnetic and cross helicity. The macroscopic
Reynolds numbers are dimensionally estimated using µ, η, ε, E, and the kinetic energy EK as Re = (EK)1/2E3/2/(εµ)
(hydrodynamic) and Rm = RePrm (magnetic) with the magnetic Prandtl number Prm = µ/η set to unity. The
respective numerical values of the parameters are µ = 8 × 10−4, Re ≈ 5400 (NS) and µ = η = 5 × 10−4, Re ≈ 5200
(MHD). Cases with Prm 6= 1 while interesting due to their importance in the context of turbulent dynamos (see e.g.
[24, 25]) are beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed in future work.

After the runs have reached macroscopic quasi-equilibrium the trajectories of massless point particles marking the
ﬂuid are traced over 13.5T0 (NS) and 11T0 (MHD) corresponding to 500τd and 350τd, respectively. The initial particle
positions are chosen in ﬁve groups of tetrads with diﬀerent particle-pair separations (cf. Table I).

In statistically isotropic turbulence single tracer particles are expected [26] to show a diﬀusive time dependence of
the mean-square particle displacement h(X(t) − X 0)2i ∼ t, X 0 = X(0), for t ≫ TL where TL is the autocorrelation
time of the Lagrangian velocity V (t). Here, TL ≈ 16τd (NS) and TL ≈ 15τd (MHD). If t ≪ TL ballistic scaling is
predicted, h(X(t) − X 0)2i ∼ t2.

In both simulations (cf. ﬁg. 1) ballistic scaling can be identiﬁed up to about TL. Diﬀusive behavior is observed
for t & 50τd. At t & 70τd the particles have traveled about 500ℓd, i.e. half the size of the simulation volume, and
ﬁnite-size eﬀects as well as the inﬂuence of the large-scale driving can be detected. The normalized turbulent diﬀusion
0 dτ hV (t)V (t + τ )i/hV 2(t)i with the avergage running over all trajectories shows for both
coeﬃcient Dturb(t∗) = R
systems in the interval 0 < t∗ . 50τd a steep increase with a subsequent saturation at the asymptotic value TL.

It is found that with regard to turbulent single-particle diﬀusion the NS and the MHD system show no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences. The small oﬀset of the MHD displacement curve compared to the NS simulation is explained by the lower
level of kinetic energy in the MHD system which is not fully compensated by the applied normalization. An analytically
predicted slowing down of diﬀusion (and dispersion) [27] is not found here. The cited result is however based on the
restricting assumption of a velocity ﬁeld which is delta-correlated in time thereby neglecting the dynamically important
adaptation of the velocity ﬂuctuations to the magnetic ﬁeld structure.

The observed similarity of the curves in ﬁg. 1 indicates that statistics of single-particle trajectories is not a
proper instrument to study the structural diﬀerences in the velocity ﬁeld of the NS and MHD systems caused by
macroscopically isotropic magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (cf. [28, 29, 30] for numerical simulations).

In this respect a more instructive diagnostic is relative pair-separation or dispersion statistics where the separation,

(black) and MHD turbulence. The dashed lines indicate ballistic scaling ∼ t2 and diﬀusive behavior.

FIG. 2: Evolution of normalized mean-square relative dispersion in Navier-Stokes (black) and MHD turbulence. The behavior
for three diﬀerent initial pair-separations (particle groups in Table I) are shown, solid: group 1, dashed: group 3, dash-dotted:
group 5. Straight lines denote ballistic ∼ t2 and diﬀusive scaling.

∆ = X 1(t) − X 2(t), of two particles is considered [31]. The pair-separation in the ballistic regime, t ≪ τd, where
the particle velocities are ﬁnite and constant obeys the relation h(∆(t) − ∆0)2i ∼ t2 (see [6] for experimental and
[9, 10] for numerical results (all NS)) while for t ≫ TL diﬀusive scaling holds, h(∆(t) − ∆0)2i ∼ t since the dynamics
of particles forming a pair are statistically independent in this case.

The asymptotic limits can be identiﬁed in ﬁg. 2 with diﬀerences between NS and MHD statistics showing up at
intermediate times. For clarity, only data based on the particle groups 1, 3, and 5 (cf. Table I) are shown. In both
systems the evolution of groups 2 and 4 is qualitatively similar to the behavior of group 3. As expected ballistic
scaling ∼ t2 is visible in both simulations for short times up to about τd. Eventually, for t & 160τd an approach
to the diﬀusive limit is seen rudimentally. The dispersion is accelerating during 10 . t . 100. However, neither
the Batchelor law [31], h(∆ − ∆0)2i = 11/3C2(ε∆0)2/3t2, (cf.
[32]) nor Richardson scaling [33], h∆2i ∼ εt3, (cf.
[6, 11]) can be clearly identiﬁed since the simulations do not generate suﬃciently large inertial ranges. In addition,
the theoretical preconditions necessary for Batchelor and Richardson behavior are not satisﬁed in the simulations
presented here. In particular, Batchelor dispersion requires ∆0 to lie in the inertial range [31] for recovering of the
exact prefactor. Richardson scaling is also not expected since it would entail very large ∆ in the inertial range [33].
In addition Richardson behaviour would imply an appoach of the pair-separation curves to one universal scaling law
independent of ∆0 which is not observed here.

Black lines: NS, grey lines: MHD

While the evolution of NS and MHD dispersion is qualitatively similar the acceleration phase in the MHD system
is signiﬁcantly delayed compared to the NS case. The reason for this diﬀerence is found in the averaged separation
velocity hUki in the direction of the separation vector ∆ with U = ˙∆ = Uk
∆/∆ + U ⊥ shown in ﬁg. 3 in units
of vd = ℓd/τd. The separation velocity for all particle groups except groups 5 (cf. Table I) which have the largest
initial separation, ∆0, displays a continous increase before passing through a slowing-down phase for t & τd. The
beginning of the slowing-down marks the point of time at which the particles start to sense temporal ﬂuctuations
of the velocity ﬁeld. The subsequent acceleration of dispersion can be understood by the increasing importance of
sweeping by more coherent larger-scale eddies. The maximal separation velocity for all particle groups except groups
5 is reached around 90τd (NS) and 150τd (MHD). There the mean pair separation is about half the extent of the
periodic simulation volume and the particles start to approach each other again. The temporal shift of the MHD
maxima compared to the NS curves as seen in ﬁg. 3 is explained by the smaller kinetic energy of the MHD system
and the observed stronger slowing-down of the average MHD pair-separation velocity. The separation velocity curves
for the largest initial pair-separations (groups 5) do not display the slowing-down phase since these pairs probe only
the largest spatial scales of the ﬂow where the driving is governing turbulent dynamics, cf. [9].

The main diﬀerence between the NS and MHD cases, however, lies in the slowing-down phase which is much more

pronounced in the MHD simulation.

The reason is the well-known anisotropy of turbulent eddies with respect to the local magnetic ﬁeld, see for example
[34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Since small-scale eddies are elongated in the local magnetic ﬁeld direction MHD ﬂuid elements
are more likely to travel in similar directions oriented along the local magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld-parallel velocity
component is causing the eﬀective particle pair-separation while the ﬁeld-perpendicular components are associated
with Alfv´enic quasi-oscillations which do not contribute to the average particle displacement. Contrary to the ballistic
regime with quasi-constant ﬂow velocities for t ≪ τd, the anisotropy of the ﬂuctuating velocity ﬁeld at later times has a
constricting eﬀect on turbulent dispersion compared to the NS case. Consequently, the ﬂuid particles are preferentially
traveling along the magnetic lines of force which signiﬁcantly reduces dispersion in the ﬁeld-perpendicular directions.
This conjecture is supported by ﬁg. 4 which shows probability distributions of the angle γ = ∡(U , B) for particle
group 1 and points of time in the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 64τd introducing a rough proxy of the mean magnetic ﬁeld at scale
∆, B = [b(X 1) + b(X 2)]/2.

For isotropic random velocities a sinusoidal distribution (thin solid line) would be expected. However, it is seen
that even for comparably large times the distribution of the angle P (γ) exhibits a clear deviation from this behavior
favoring velocities aligned with the magnetic-ﬁeld proxy B. The observed trend to sinusoidality with increasing time
is due to h∆i approaching the largest scales of the ﬂow which leads to weakly correlated ﬂuctuations in U and B.
This trend is limited by the way of forcing chosen in this work.

Apart from pair-dispersion, tracer dynamics display another interesting diﬀerence between Navier-Stokes and MHD
turbulence. At smallest scales in the vicinity of the most singular dissipative structures the tracer trajectories diﬀer
signiﬁcantly. In the NS simulation where the smallest ﬂow structures are vortex ﬁlaments the ﬂuid particles describe
helical motions around the ﬁlaments (cf. also [10]). In contrast, vorticity sheets typical for smallest-scales in MHD

line denotes the distribution P (γ) = (π/360) sin(γ) indicating isotropic dispersion.

turbulence lead to characteristic kinks in the tracer path. While the resulting trajectories are strongly diﬀerent and
characteristic for the respective turbulent system, these events occur too seldomly to have a measurable eﬀect on the
statistics of diﬀusion and dispersion regarded in this paper.

In summary it was shown by comparison of direct numerical simulations of macroscopically isotropic Navier-Stokes
(NS) and nonhelical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence that the magnetic ﬁeld in MHD turbulence slows down
average pair-dispersion for intermediate times, τd . t . 10τd, compared to NS behavior. This eﬀect is shown to be due
to alignment of turbulent velocity and magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in turbulent single-particle
diﬀusion could not be detected. Fluid particle trajectories in the vicinity of the strongly dissipative structures are
characteristically diﬀerent although these events have a negligible inﬂuence on the statistics investigated in this work.

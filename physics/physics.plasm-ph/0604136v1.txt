Abstract

The ion phase-space dynamics in the Coulomb explosion of very large (

106

107 atoms) deu-

∼

−

terium clusters can be tailored using two consecutive laser pulses with diﬀerent intensities and an

appropriate time delay. For suitable sets of laser parameters (intensities and delay), large-scale

shock shells form during the explosion, thus highly increasing the probability of fusion reactions

within the single exploding clusters. In order to analyze the ion dynamics and evaluate the in-

tracluster reaction rate, a one-dimensional theory is used, which approximately accounts for the

electron expulsion from the clusters. It is found that, for very large clusters (initial radius

100

∼

nm), and optimal laser parameters, the intracluster fusion yield becomes comparable to the inter-

cluster fusion yield. The validity of the results is conﬁrmed with three-dimensional particle-in-cell

simulations.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, CPA (chirped pulse ampliﬁcation) laser technology [1] allows the table-top

production of ultra-short (

10

100 fs) laser pulses, with peak power up to the Petawatt

∼

−

level [2]. When focusing such lasers to spot sizes of a few tens of micrometers, peak intensities

up to 1021 W/cm2 can be achieved, opening new research realms in the ﬁeld of light-matter

interaction. Among these, the interaction of ultra-intense lasers with clustered gases has

become a central research topic [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], mainly owing to the amazingly

eﬃcient coupling of ultra-intense laser radiation to clustered media; in experiments, nearly

100% of the total laser energy has been observed to be deposited within a few millimeters

propagation length [9, 12]. This eﬀective energy absorption results in various experimental

evidences, such as bright x-ray emission [13, 14, 15, 16], production of highly-ionized matter

[17, 18, 19], generation of energetic electrons and ions [20, 21, 22, 23], and copious production

of fusion neutrons [4, 5, 6, 7].

Depending on the gas, the size of the clusters, and the laser features, a huge variety

of physical scenarios is possible, from the slow, hydrodynamic expansion of quasi-neutral

nanoplasmas to the violent Coulomb explosion of highly-charged ion clouds. In this paper,

the attention is focused on the nonlinear ion dynamics in the Coulomb explosion of large

(106

107 atoms) deuterium clusters irradiated with ultra-intense (1018

1021 W/cm2)

−

−

lasers. In the conditions considered here, all the atoms in a cluster are immediately stripped

of their only electron, via ﬁeld ionization, at the leading edge of the laser pulse, and the

nanoplasma approximation [17] can be adopted. The newly-formed free electrons can then

be expelled, partially or totally, from the host cluster (outer ionization).

If this process

is extremely fast with respect to the explosion time scale, its dynamics may be neglected,

but such an extreme scenario is met only with small clusters (less than 10000 atoms). For

large clusters (106

108 atoms), the outer ionization dynamics is crucial [24, 25, 26] and

−

it highly aﬀects the explosion features. In the present work, we explore the possibility of

using two sequential laser pulses (“double pump” henceforth) to control the outer ionization

process and to drive large-scale shock shells [24, 27] during the Coulomb explosion of large

deuterium clusters. As a consequence of the shock shell formation, relative velocities appear

between ions belonging to a single exploding cluster and intracluster DD fusion reactions

may take place in the early phase of the explosion, long before the neighboring clusters start

2

interacting with one another. It is found that, for optimal double-pump parameters, the

intracluster fusion yield can become comparable with the intercluster fusion yield. Hence,

for appropriate experimental conditions, a time-resolved burst of fusion neutrons should

be detected before the usual bulk of fusion neutrons, thus providing a clear experimental

evidence for the formation of shock shells on a nanometer scale [27].

In the present work, the laser-induced Coulomb explosion is modeled using an approx-

imate 1D theory, in which a prescribed electron dynamics, related to the pulse envelope

function, is assumed [24]. The validity of the results is then conﬁrmed with highly-realistic,

three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) [28]. The simulation framework adopted here

is OSIRIS 2.0 [29], a state-of-the-art, massively-parallel, electromagnetic, fully-relativistic,

3D PIC code.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the formation of large-scale shock shells

in Coulomb explosions is introduced. In Section III, a 1D model for the Coulomb explosion is

outlined, with an emphasis on the inclusion of the eﬀects caused by the electron dynamics.

In Section IV, the 1D model is employed to study the intracluster fusion reactions. The

fusion yield from intracluster and intercluster reactions are compared in Section V, and

three-dimensional PIC simulations of the double-pump technique are presented in Section

VI. Finally, the conclusions are stated.

II. LARGE-SCALE SHOCK SHELLS IN COULOMB EXPLOSIONS

The possible formation of shocks [30] during the Coulomb explosion of an ideal pure-ion

sphere has been recently demonstrated theoretically [27]. In particular, it has been shown

that every radial nonuniformity in the initial ion density proﬁle leads to the formation of

a multi-branch phase-space structure, which is named a shock shell, accompanied by the

appearance of one or more peaks in the ion density proﬁle. Such structures form when the

initial ion density is nonuniform and a maximum in the radial velocity proﬁle soon forms at

some radius within the distribution, leading to a characteristic overtaking process between

the ions.

One interesting consequence of the shock formation is the possible occurrence of ener-

getic ion-ion collisions within a single expanding cluster. For instance, the appearance of

pronounced shock shells in the explosion of very large (106

107 atoms) deuterium clusters

−

3

could cause an enhancement in the probability of intracluster fusion reactions. According

to the theory, in order to obtain a large-scale shock shell, the nonuniformity in the initial

density proﬁle must be large-scale as well. In fact, if the initial density proﬁle diﬀers just

slightly from a uniform, step-like proﬁle, the corresponding shock shell is doomed to be

small-scale and cannot involve signiﬁcant relative velocities and collision energies. Results

from 3D numerical simulations of the interaction of an ultra-intense laser with large deu-

terium clusters in realistic conditions showed that shocks may form naturally even when

starting from uniform, step-like density proﬁles [24] because the electron dynamics in the

laser ﬁeld smooths out the ion density proﬁle in the early stages of the interaction. However,

the simulations also showed these spontaneously-occurring shocks are small-scale, so that no

appreciable relative velocities appear within the cluster, which means that no shock-driven,

intracluster fusion events occur.

At ﬁrst sight, inducing such reactions via generation of large-scale shock shells in ex-

ploding deuterium clusters would then appear unfeasible, as it would require the ability to

tailor the initial radial density proﬁle of roughly spherical objects on the nanometer scale.

Surprisingly, on the contrary, such an apparently-diﬃcult goal can be achieved quite simply

by using a suitable sequence of laser pulses with diﬀerent intensities [24]. In fact, if the ﬁrst

pulse is relatively weak, only a small number of electrons are stripped oﬀ the host cluster, and

a slow expansion takes place, driven by both Coulomb repulsion and hydrodynamic pressure

of the hot electrons [17]. As the expansion goes on, the ion density in the outer region of

the cluster decreases, while the cluster core remains dense and approximately neutral:

in

this way, a smoothly-decreasing plasma density proﬁle is naturally formed. Afterwards, if

the electrons are suddenly swept away from the cluster core by a second, extremely-intense

pulse, the inner ions immediately feel a much higher repulsive force than the outer ions do.

The cluster core explodes abruptly and the fastest inner ions overrun the slowly-expanding

outer ions, leading to the formation of a large-scale shock shell. Such a situation is well

depicted in Fig. 1, where colored spheres indicate position and energy of a random sample

of ions, after the passage of the second pulse (the ﬁgure has been built from the results of

the 3D PIC simulation discussed in Section VI).

The double-pump technique not only provides an eﬀective method to induce large-scale

shock shells in the Coulomb explosion of very large clusters, but it also provides the ability

to control the phase-space structure of the exploding clusters, by varying the delay between

4

the two pulses, ∆t, and the peak intensity of the ﬁrst pulse, I1. The dependence of the

explosion features on these parameters is analyzed in detail in the following sections, where

we investigate the possibility of inducing intracluster, shock driven fusion reactions in double-

pump experiments.

Alternatively, large-scale shock shells can also be driven using clusters constituted by

more than one species, as long as the ion charge-to-mass density ratio decreases radially.

Such possibility will be explored in a future publication [31].

III. 1D MODEL FOR COULOMB EXPLOSION

A proper tuning of the double-pump parameters requires a deep knowledge of their inﬂu-

ence on the explosion dynamics, the shock shell formation and evolution, and, consequently,

the intracluster fusion yield. Since a direct parameter scan via either 2D or 3D PIC sim-

ulations would have been impracticable, because it is too computationally demanding, we

have developed a simple 1D theoretical model that allowed us to investigate the eﬀects of

the key double-pump parameters, namely the time delay between the pulses, ∆t, and the

peak intensity of the ﬁrst pulse, I1.

Our model, which is an extended version of the standard model for the Coulomb explo-

sion of a spherical pure-ion cluster (cf.

[27]), is suitable for both spherical and cylindrical

symmetry and takes into account the eﬀect of the electron population in the expanding

cluster. The electron population follows a prescribed dynamics, determined uniquely by the

laser pulse features. In this framework, the acceleration of an ion at a given time τ and

radial position r can be written, in dimensionless units, as

d2r
dτ 2 =

Q(r)

(1)

where γ accounts for the geometry (γ = 2 for spherical geometry, γ = 1 for cylindrical

geometry), and where mass is normalized to m (ion mass), length to R0 (initial radius of the

cluster), charge to the elementary charge e, and time to t0 =

mRγ+1

/ (e2N0); t0 also

q(cid:0)

(cid:1)

represents the time scale for the explosion of a pure-ion spherical/cylindrical distribution,

being N0 the total number of ions (per unit length in the cylindrical case). The quantity

Q(r) is the ion charge within a sphere/cylinder of radius r, while Qel(r, τ ) describes the

absolute value of the electron charge still present within the same sphere/cylinder at time τ .

5

Using the Cluster Barrier Suppression Ionization (CBSI) model described in [32], Qel(r, τ )

can be determined from the instantaneous value of the laser-ﬁeld envelope function, El(τ ).

According to the CBSI theory, an electron is expelled from the cluster boundary to inﬁnity

where R is the cluster radius at time τ (the √2 factor accounts for the periodicity of the

laser electric ﬁeld). To determine Qel(r, τ ) we need a further assumption on the radial

proﬁle of the electron distribution. The simplest choice is to assume that, at each time τ ,

the remaining electrons fully neutralize the cluster core. The permanence of a core of cold

electrons within the cluster is clearly visible in PIC simulations [24, 33] and it has been

recently explained theoretically in [34]. Thus, Qel(r, τ ) takes the form

providing a simple model for studying the Coulomb explosion of large clusters driven by a

general sequence of laser pulses, having diﬀerent intensities and envelopes. This model can

be used to analyze scenarios involving the formation of large-scale shock shells, allowing the

control of the shock features through tuning of the pulse parameters.

As long as the initial ion density proﬁle ρ0(r0) is known, Eq. (5) can be readily integrated

numerically by following the trajectory r(r0, τ ) of a ﬁnite set of ions with diﬀerent initial

position r0. Details of the numerical model will be described elsewhere.

INTRACLUSTER FUSION REACTIONS

Large-scale shock shells are characterized by a well-deﬁned multi-branch structure in the

v

r phase space, most frequently a three-branch structure [24, 27] as the one in Fig. 2,

−

6

which refers to the Coulomb explosion of a pure-ion sphere with a nonuniform radial density

proﬁle [27]. As the explosion goes on, the upper branch overlaps the lower branches: the

shock shell widens radially, narrowing its velocity spread, and, meanwhile, the ion density

on each branch decreases. Therefore, one can reasonably expect the probability of nuclear

reactions between ions belonging to diﬀerent branches to be higher in the early stages after

the shock shell formation and to decrease rapidly at advanced times.

At each radius r and time τ , the number of reactions per unit time and unit volume,

is given (in dimensionless units) by

where f (r, v) is the 1D distribution function for the ions and ˆσ the normalized DD fusion

because there are no relative velocities; within the shock shell, it simply reduces to the sum

over the three branches of the phase space proﬁle (identiﬁed in color in Fig. 2):

The 1D theory here described provides a useful framework to perform parametric studies

long enough to allow the formation of a decreasing density proﬁle but not so long to let the

outer ions expand to large r, far from the cluster core.

When analyzing the results of the parametric studies, the approximations introduced in

the 1D theory must be kept in mind. First, as hydrodynamic eﬀects are neglected, the

eﬀect of the ﬁrst pulse is underestimated when dealing with low values of I1, meaning that,

in reality, the ﬁrst expansion is faster than what is predicted by Eq. (5) and the optimal

value of I1 is actually lower than expected. Furthermore, the 1D theory cannot include

laser polarization eﬀects which may aﬀect the dynamics by causing an asymmetry in the

explosion. Finally, the 1D theory with CBSI model is expected to break down with enormous

clusters (R0 > 500 nm - 1 µm), having initial radius similar to the laser central wavelength,

meaning that the predicted optimal double-pump parameters could be unreliable in such

cases.

VI.

We have tested the validity of the reduced model by comparison with a series of results

from single-pump 2D PIC simulations in various conﬁguration of cluster size and laser peak

intensity. Figures 3a and 3b show comparisons between lineouts (along the laser propagation

(ˆx) and polarization (ˆy) directions) of the ion density distribution, taken from the simulation

results, and the density proﬁle predicted by the 1D theory. Both plots refer to the interaction

of a circular, rodlike cluster (initial radius R0 = 32 nm, particle density n0 = 4.56
×
1022 cm−3) with a laser pulse having central wavelength λ0 = 820 nm, and approximately
1016 W/cm2

Gaussian envelope with rise time trise = 35 fs. The peak intensities are Ia = 4

(Fig. 3a) and Ib = 1.6

1019 W/cm2 (Fig. 3b). As expected, the results from the 1D

×

×

model are quantitatively more accurate in the high-intensity case, where Coulomb forces

are dominant, than in the low-intensity case, where hydrodynamic eﬀects and polarization

eﬀects are relevant, and the cluster expands more rapidly than what is predicted by the 1D

theory. For these reasons, when exploring the possibility of intracluster fusion reactions, we

resorted to the 1D model to seek a good combination of double-pump parameters, which we

then adjusted and employed to perform accurate 3D PIC simulations presented in Section

The model also provides information on how the initial cluster size R0 aﬀects

, allowing

one to perform PIC simulations using clusters with initial radius R0

10 nm and then to

extrapolate the results to the case of extremely large clusters having initial radius R0

nm, without performing new, and extremely large, simulations.

8

Here, we present results from parametric studies, with respect to I1 and ∆t, for several

cluster sizes, with initial radii, R0, in the range 16

200 nm. For each R0, we consider a

spherical cluster of atomic deuterium (with uniform step-like density proﬁle, n0 = 4.56
cm−3) hit by a pulse sequence in which a weak laser pulse (peak intensity I1 (variable), central

are partly due to the variation of the DD fusion cross section, σ, with the collision energy. In

fact, as follows from Eqs. (7)-(9), if σ were constant,

N
optimal intensity for the ﬁrst pulse would scale as R2
0, while the optimal delay would stay

max would be proportional to R4

0, the

the same. In that case, the two plots in Fig. 4 would have the same shape and

max would

N

increase by a factor less than 100. The dependence of the optimal combination of I1 and

∆t on the initial cluster size is depicted in Fig. 5, along with the corresponding variation of

max. As R0 increases, the optimal intensity of the ﬁrst pulse increases as well, while the

N
optimal delay decreases and appears to saturate towards the value ∆t = 125 fs.

For both cases showed in Fig. 4, we report the evolution of the v

r phase space proﬁle

−

(starting right after the second pulse reaches the expanding cluster causing the formation
of the shock shell), along with the time history of the reaction rate R, in Figs. 6 and 7, re-
spectively. As one can see, R exhibits a sharp peak immediately after the shock formation,

which occurs at time t1, causing the probability of intracluster fusion reactions to retain

appreciable values only for a time interval of a few tens of fs. Intracluster fusion reactions

represent a much faster, and profoundly diﬀerent, phenomenon than intercluster reactions

(whose typical time scale is

10

100 ps [35]): they occur abruptly in the single clusters

∼

−

9

when the particular phase-space dynamics origins a tiny, high-density, and short-lived reac-

tion volume (the shock shell). On the contrary, intercluster reactions occur later in the big,

long-lived reaction volume which is the whole plasma ﬁlament created by the laser pulses.

An estimate of the respective contributions of the two, distinct processes to the total fusion

yield is presented below.

V.

INTRACLUSTER AND INTERCLUSTER FUSION YIELDS

In the last years, various experiments revealed the occurrence of nuclear fusion reactions

in clustered media irradiated by ultra-intense fs lasers [4, 5, 6, 7]. Most theoretical models

developed to explain the experimental results showed that fusion reactions arise primarily

from collisions between fast ions belonging to diﬀerent clusters [4, 5, 6, 7, 26, 33, 35], though

the contribution from collisions of fast ions with colder ions and atoms outside the plasma

ﬁlament created by the laser has also been investigated [36]. Here, we analyze the role of

intracluster, shock-driven fusion reactions in double-pump scenarios, for diﬀerent cluster

sizes, and we compare the intracluster fusion yield with the intercluster fusion yield.

For the calculation of the intercluster fusion yield, YIC, we refer to the simple model

presented in [35], where YIC is evaluated as

being ¯n the average atomic density inside the reaction volume Vr, Td the plasma disassembly

time (typical time for the expansion of the plasma in the reaction volume), and

∼

In the previous section, we analyzed the explosion dynamics of a single cluster, neglecting

its interaction with the neighboring clusters, and calculated the probability of intracluster

reactions. Now, and in order to compare intracluster and intercluster fusion yields, we must

consider the whole spatial distribution of clusters. For the sake of simplicity, we consider the

ideal situation of a reaction volume containing a ﬁxed number of deuterium atoms grouped

in Ncl spherical clusters of equal size R0, with a mean separation distance d, distributed on

a regular square lattice. Given the average atomic density ¯n, the total number of clusters is
rHr¯n/N0 and the intercluster distance is d = R0 [4πn0/ (3¯n)]1/3. The intracluster

Ncl = πR2

fusion yield, Yic, can be evaluated as

Yic = Ncl

N

(13)

provided that the ratio δ = d/R0 (which depends only on the packing fraction ¯n/n0 [33]) be

suﬃciently high (δ > 20

25) and, consequently, most intracluster reactions occur before

−

the cluster cores start interacting with one another. In the opposite case (small values of

δ: δ < 10

15), almost no intracluster reactions can occur before the cluster cores start

−

×

interacting with one another. This is explained by noticing that, typically, the intracluster
reaction rate, R, peaks when the radius of the outer boundary of the shock shell, Rsh,

4

is Rsh
15R0 (see
Figs. 6, 7). If ¯n = 1019 cm−3, a typical experimental value, and with the cluster density

n0 = 4.56

1022 cm−3 here considered, one obtains d/R0

27. In such a low packing fraction

≃

case, Yic can be evaluated through Eq. (13) and a comparison with YIC is readily carried out.

Figure 8 reports the value of YIC and Yic for diﬀerent cluster sizes: for each value of R0 we

sought the optimal combination of double-pump parameters (see Fig. 5) and then calculated

the corresponding fusion yields. The contribution of the intracluster reactions grows rapidly

with R0, meaning that the growth of the shock shells and the increase of the fusion cross

section prevail against the decrease of the number of clusters in the reaction volume. On the

contrary, the intercluster fusion yield, though keeping a high value, decreases at very high

R0 because collision energies beyond the one that maximizes σ start to appear. This is well

illustrated in Fig. 9, where the maximum intracluster and intercluster collision energies are

11

compared for diﬀerent cluster sizes, along with σ (

coll). For initial cluster radii & 70

σ (

coll), while the maximum collision energy for intracluster reactions lies to the left of it

E

even for initial cluster radii as high as 200 nm: this explains the results of Fig. 8.

From our discussion, we conclude that, in principle, a double pump experiment with

optimized pulse parameters, very-large clusters, and low packing fraction, should provide a

clear signature for the occurrence of intracluster, shock-driven fusion reactions, in the form

of a time-resolved burst of fusion neutrons which anticipates the bulk of fusion neutrons

produced via both intercluster reactions within the plasma ﬁlament and ion-ion/ion-atom

collisions outside the plasma ﬁlament.

VI. THREE DIMENSIONAL PIC SIMULATIONS

In order to check the validity of the analysis presented above, and to get deeper physical

insights, we have performed 3D PIC simulations of the laser-cluster interaction in a double-

pump case, treating self-consistently the dynamics of electrons and ions in the laser ﬁeld, the

outer ionization dynamics, and the full dynamics of both the slow expansion induced by the

ﬁrst pulse and the sudden explosion driven by the second pulse. In PIC simulations, a set

of computational particles is moved under the action of their self-consistent electromagnetic

ﬁeld and any externally applied ﬁeld: this is done by ﬁrst depositing the current density on

a spatial grid, then solving Maxwell’s equations on the same grid and computing the force

accelerating each particle, by interpolation of the ﬁeld values on the position of the point

particle.

We ﬁrst consider the simulation of the irradiation of a cluster having radius R0 = 32 nm
1022 cm−3 with a pulse sequence whose parameters are the optimal

and density n0 = 4.56

ones calculated in Section IV (I1 = 8.6

1016 W/cm2, ∆t = 236 fs), except for the peak

×

intensity of the ﬁrst laser, which has been lowered to I1

1016 W/cm2, to compensate

×

2

≃

×

for the underestimation of the expansion velocity in the 1D model. The second pulse, having

peak intensity I2

1.3

1019 W/cm2 and a shorter pulse duration (trise = 20 fs), hits the

≃

×

cluster with time delay ∆t = 236 fs (same as the optimal value calculated above). Single-

pulse 3D simulations had already shown that peak intensities lower than I2 suﬃce to expel

all cluster electrons before the peak of the pulse reaches the cluster [24], even though the

12

electron dynamics cannot be assumed as instantaneous on the explosion time scale. Both

pulses are linearly polarized along the ˆz direction, propagate in the ˆx direction, and their

envelope is approximately Gaussian. The simulation box is cubic, with side Lbox = 1 µm,

discretized in a 420

420

420 uniform spatial grid and the number of particles per species

is 6.4

106, a value close to the actual number of atoms, for the conﬁguration described.

×

We concentrate our analysis on the ion dynamics in the second part of the simulation,

when the more intense laser interacts with the slowly-expanding cluster, driving its Coulomb

explosion: right before the interaction with the second pulse begins, the ion density and

phase-space proﬁles appear as in Fig. 10, where the density proﬁle is decreasing from the

center toward the periphery, but the expansion is clearly asymmetric, being much faster

along the laser polarization direction, as also testiﬁed by the phase space lineouts. As a

comparison, the density and velocity proﬁles obtained with the 1D model are also plotted

(in the optimal case I1 = 8.6

1016 W/cm2, ∆t = 236 fs). In the PIC simulation, the cluster

×

has expanded slightly more, despite the lower value of I1 (meaning hydrodynamics eﬀects

are indeed very relevant for the conﬁguration considered), and the density proﬁle is diﬀerent

from the theoretical one, being the cluster core less dense. These diﬀerences, which are due

the limitations of the 1D model, where a crude approximation on the electron dynamics is

adopted, do not prevent the formation of a large-scale shock shell. Yet, they appear to aﬀect

the Coulomb explosion dynamics, especially in limiting the maximum energy acquired by

the inner ions (120 keV instead of the 210 keV predicted by the 1D theory). This is clearly

visible in Fig. 11, where the ion phase-space history is shown. Again, two curves along the

ˆy and ˆz directions are plotted and compared with the theoretical curves. The core explosion

is much more symmetric than the ﬁrst slow expansion, since the electrons are quite rapidly

expelled from the cluster and their dynamics has a smaller inﬂuence on the ion dynamics

than during the ﬁrst expansion. The explosion predicted by the 1D theory is more violent

for a variety of reasons: ﬁrst, when the second pulse hits the plasma and the explosion

starts, the Coulomb energy stored in the cluster core, where much more charge is packed

(cf. Fig. 10), is higher (which also explains why the dynamics of the outer ions, the ones

forming the lower branch of the phase space proﬁle, resembles the numerical results more

than the dynamics of the inner ions). Furthermore, in the PIC simulations, neutralization

by the hot electrons expelled from the cluster, but remaining in the computational domain

(where the total net charge is zero), also play a role, as well as 3D eﬀects, anisotropies,

13

boundary eﬀects arising when the ion cloud gets as big as the simulation box, and possible

propagation eﬀects in the underdense expanding plasma surrounding the dense cluster core.

The simulations results show that the optimal double-pump conﬁguration predicted by

the 1D theory represents a good approximation for inducing the formation of large-shock

shells, capable of driving intracluster nuclear reactions in realistic cases, even though all the

eﬀects mentioned above can highly aﬀect the expansion/explosion dynamics. Their inﬂuence

on the reaction yield needs investigation, for instance through numerical calculation of the

reaction rates during the PIC simulations, to be presented in a future publication. However,

a ﬁrst estimate based on Eq. (7) suggests that diﬀerences in the ion dynamics like those of

Fig. 11, where PIC calculations predict a shock shell with velocity amplitude reduced by

a factor of two with respect to the 1D model, should result in intracluster reaction yields

reduced by a factor of the same order (the actual reduction depends on the variations of σ

for the conditions considered). In the case analyzed here, results also seem to suggest that a

more pronounced shock shell, with dynamics more akin to the theoretical model, would be

obtained with a weaker ﬁrst pulse and/or a shorter time delay, and with a stronger second

pulse. These trends should hold with larger clusters (R0

100

200 nm) too, provided that

∼

−

conditions lie in the range of validity of the 1D theory.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The explosion dynamics of large deuterium clusters irradiated by sequential laser pulses

having diﬀerent intensities has been investigated, focusing on the formation and evolution of

large-scale shock shells in the ion phase space, which lead to the occurrence of intracluster

fusion reactions. The eﬀect of the double-pump parameters (delay of the second pulse and

intensity of the ﬁrst pulse) on the number of intracluster fusion reactions has been analyzed

using a 1D model which approximately accounts for the outer ionization dynamics. After the

optimal double-pump conﬁguration has been found, for diﬀerent cluster sizes, the optimal

intracluster fusion yield has been calculated and compared with the intercluster yield, ﬁnding

that intracluster reactions become important with very large clusters (radius

100 nm).

∼

The optimal double-pump parameters obtained with the 1D model have then been used to

perform three dimensional PIC simulations, whose results conﬁrmed the formation of well-

pronounced shock shells with high relative velocities inside the single exploding clusters.

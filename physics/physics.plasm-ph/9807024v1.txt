Abstract

The analytical and numerical investigations of the energy loss rate of the
test particle in a magnetized electron plasma are developed on the basis of
the Vlasov-Poisson equations, and the main results are presented. The Larmor
rotation of a test particle in a magnetic ﬁeld is taken into account. The analysis
is based on the assumption that the energy variation of the test particle is
much less than its kinetic energy. The obtained general expression for stopping
power is analyzed for three cases: (i) the particle moves through a collisionless
plasma in a strong homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld; (ii) the fast particle moves
through a magnetized collisionless plasma along the magnetic ﬁeld; and (iii)
the particle moves through a magnetized collisional plasma across a magnetic
ﬁeld. Calculations are carried out for the arbitrary test particle velocities in
the ﬁrst case, and for fast particles in the second and third cases. It is shown
that the rate at which a fast test particle loses energy while moving across a
magnetic ﬁeld may be much higher than the loss in the case of motion through
plasma without magnetic ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

−

Energy loss of fast charged particles in a plasma has been a topic of great
interest since the 1950s [1-8] due to its considerable importance for the study
of basic interactions of the charged particles in real media; moreover, recently
it has also become a great concern in connection with heavy-ion driven inertial
fusion research [5-8].

The nature of experimental plasma physics is such that experiments are
usually performed in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds, and consequently it is of
interest to investigate the eﬀects of a magnetic ﬁeld on the energy loss rate.
Strong magnetic ﬁelds used in the laboratory investigations of plasmas can
appreciably inﬂuence the processes determined by Coulomb collisions [9]. This
inﬂuence is even more important in white dwarfs and in neutron stars, the
magnetic ﬁelds on the surfaces of which can be as high as 105

1010 kG.

Stopping of charged particles in a magnetized plasma has been the subject
of several papers [10-15]. Stopping of a fast test particle moving with veloc-
ity u much higher than the electron thermal velocity vT was studied in Refs.
[10,11,13]. Energy loss of a charged particle moving with arbitrary velocity
was studied in Ref. [12]. The expression obtained there for the Coulomb log-
arithm, L = ln(λD/ρ⊥) (where λD is the Debye length and ρ⊥ is the impact
parameter for scattering for an angle ϑ = π/2), corresponds to the classical de-
scription of collisions. In the quantum-mechanical case, the Coulomb logarithm
is L = ln(λD/λB), where λB is the de Broglie wavelength of plasma electrons
[16].

In Ref. [15], the expressions were derived describing the stopping power of
a charged particle in Maxwellian plasma placed in a classically strong (but not
λD, where ac is the electron Larmor
ac ≪
quantizing) magnetic ﬁeld (λB ≪
radius), under the conditions when scattering must be described quantum me-
chanically. Calculations were carried out for slow test particles whose velocities
satisfy the conditions (me/mi)1/3vT < u
vT , where mi is the mass of the
plasma ions and me is the electron mass.

The reaction of a uniform plasma to an electrostatic ﬁeld of a moving test
particle was studied by Rostoker and Rosenbluth [17] for two cases, in the pres-
ence or absence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. For a test particle having velocity
vT in the positive z direction, the dielectric function for no magnetic ﬁeld
u
gives a resonance kz = ωp/u. As a result, the emission of plasma waves by the
test particle with given k is concentrated on the cone forming an angle θ with
respect to u, where cos θ = kz/k. As shown by Rostoker and Rosenbluth, this

θ with the
leads to a
negative z axis. Their treatment in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld was very
general and involved no assumption concerning the relative magnitudes of ωp
and ωc, i.e., the electron’s plasma and cyclotron frequencies. Stopping power
was not determined for any speciﬁc case. The authors were aware that in the
ωp, where ﬁeld electrons in the lowest order can respond only
case when ωc ≫
to the waves in the direction of B0, the resonance caused by the dielectric func-
tion has a diﬀerent form, with k = ωp/u, being independent of the k direction.

The electrostatic ﬁeld of a moving test particle in such magnetized plasma was
studied by Ware and Wiley [18].

In the present paper we calculate, in a framework of dielectric theory, the
energy loss rate of a test particle moving in magnetized plasma. We consider the
test particle interaction only with the electron component of plasma, since it is
this interaction that dominates the stopping of a test particle [19,20]. Besides,
in contrast with the papers [10-15], Larmor rotation of a test particle in a
magnetic ﬁeld is taken into account.

In Sec.

II, linearized Vlasov-Poisson equations are solved by means of
Fourier analysis in order to obtain a general form for the linearized poten-
tial generated in a magnetized Maxwellian plasma by a test particle and for the
energy loss rate of the test particle.

In Sec.

III, the energy loss in a Maxwellian collisionless plasma in the
presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld is examined. Calculations are carried out
for arbitrary test particle velocities. In this case, plasma oscillations are also
excited, though their spectra in the strong magnetic ﬁeld diﬀer from normal
ones.

In Sec. IV, the energy loss rate in a cold plasma is calculated in the case
when the fast particle moves along (ϑ = 0) and across (ϑ = π/2) the magnetic
ﬁeld. It is shown that in the ﬁrst case, the energy loss rate is less than Bohr’s
result. In the second case, the energy loss rate can be much higher than Bohr’s
result.

In Sec. V, we present a qualitative discussion of obtained results. In the

Appendix, analysis of the function Qν(z) is given.

2 BASIC RELATIONS

We consider a nonrelativistic charged particle having charge Ze that moves in
a magnetized plasma at an angle ϑ with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld directed
along the z axis. We assume that the energy variation of the particle is much
smaller than its kinetic energy. In this case the charge density associated with
the test particle is given by the following expression:

ρ0(r, t) = Zeδ(x

a sin(Ωct))δ(y

a cos(Ωct))δ(z

u0t),

where u0 and v are the particle velocity components along and across from the
magnetic ﬁeld B0 (u0 = u cos ϑ, v = u sin ϑ), where u is the particle velocity,
Ωc = ZeB0/M c, a = v/Ωc, and M are the Larmor frequency, the Larmor
radius, and the mass of the particle, respectively, and c is the speed of light.

The linearized Vlasov equation of the plasma may be written as

The result represents a dynamical response of the medium to the motion of

of an expansion over all the harmonics of the Larmor frequency of the particle.
The energy loss rate (ELR) S of a fast charge is deﬁned as the energy loss of
the charge in a unit time due to interactions with the plasma electrons. From
∇ϕ(r, t),

STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD

Let us analyze expression (8) in the case when a particle moves in a plasma with
a suﬃciently strong magnetic ﬁeld. Let us assume the magnetic ﬁeld, on one

hand, reasonably weak and not to be quantized (¯hωc < kBT or ac ≫
on the other hand, comparatively strong so that the cyclotron frequency of the
λD,
plasma electrons exceeds the plasma frequency ωp =
where ac is the Larmor radius and λD is the Debye length λD = vT /ωp. Because
of this assumption, the perpendicular cyclotron motion of the test and plasma
particles is neglected. The test particle’s velocity parallel to B0 is taken as u0.
The generation of an electrostatic wake by a superthermal test electron in a
magnetized electron plasma in this limit has been discussed by Ware and Wiley
[18].

The ﬁrst term of Eq. (14) is a contribution to the frictional drag due to
collisions with the plasma electrons. It is incomplete because the analysis treats
the background electrons as a continuous ﬂuid and there is no allowance being
made for the recoil of the test particle due to each collision. The other terms
are associated with the resonance giving rise to plasma wave emission.

From Eqs. (9)-(14) we can assume that the main contribution in the ELR

is given by the values of the particle’s velocity, for which X(λ) < 0 and Y (λ)
≪
. These conditions correspond to excitation of plasma waves by a moving

particle. As shown by Rostoker and Rosenbluth [17], the plasma waves were not
ωp,
determined for any speciﬁc case. They were aware that for the case ωc ≫
where the plasma electrons in the lowest order can respond to the waves only
in the direction of B0, the resonance caused by the dielectric function has
a diﬀerent form k = ωp/u0, being independent of the k direction. Plasma
waves involved in this case are oblique plasma waves having the approximate
dispersion relation ωk = ωpkz/k. In Secs. III A and III B the expression (14)
is evaluated for large and small test particle velocities.

3.1 ELR for small velocities

When a test particle moves slowly through a plasma, the electrons have much
time to experience the particle’s attractive potential. They are accelerated
towards the particle, but when they reach its trajectory the particle has already
moved forward a little bit. Hence, we expect an increased density of electrons
at some place in the trail of the particle. This negative charge density pulls
back the positive particle and gives rise to the ELR.
The Taylor expansion of Eq. (14) for small u0 (λ

However, in the case of an ideal plasma it should be noted that this law does not
depend on the plasma viscosity and is not a consequence of electron-electron
collisions with small impact parameter. These collisions are neglected in the
Vlasov equation. As described above, it is rather the fact that the dressing of
the test particle takes some time and produces the negative charge behind the
particle leading to the drag.

k(0)
max is a cutoﬀ parameter in a plasma in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld) times
smaller than the Bohr ELR [24].

Our assumption made at the beginning of this section was that the classical
approach in consideration of energy losses in plasma placed in a strong magnetic
ﬁeld limits the values of the magnetic ﬁeld itself and values of temperature and
plasma concentrations. From these conditions we can obtain

and B0 = 80 kG (solid line). The peak corresponds to excitation of plasma
waves by a moving particle.

4 ELR OF A FAST CHARGED PARTICLE IN

COLD MAGNETIZED PLASMA

We shall further analyze Eq. (8) in the case when the fast particle moves in
a cold plasma whose longitudinal dielectric function is given by the following
expressions [25,26]:

In Eq.

(8) we introduced a cutoﬀ parameter kmax in order to avoid the
logarithmic divergence at large k⊥. This divergence corresponds to the incapa-
bility of the linearized Vlasov theory to treat close encounters between the test
particle and the plasma electrons properly. The full nonlinear Vlasov equation
accurately describes the scattering of individual electrons with the test particle
in accordance with the Rutherford scattering theory. The exact expression for

In this case the ELR increases proportionally to the magnetic ﬁeld.

The above examples of the asymptotic ELR dependence on the value of the

the case when the magnetic ﬁeld is suﬃciently strong.

From Eq. (32) it is easy to trace qualitatively the behavior of energy losses
as a function of magnetic ﬁeld in the general case. Thus, as it follows from Eq.
(32), the ELR is maximal for those values of the magnetic ﬁeld for which ε(nΩc)
is small. The smallness ε(nΩc) means that the dependence of the ELR from the
ωp/Ωc,
magnetic ﬁeld reveals maxima at integer values of parameter b = a/λp ≡
where λp = 2πv/ωp is the plasma oscillations’ wavelength.

Figure 3 shows ELR to Bohr ELR ratio as a function of parameter b in two
cases: for proton (dotted line) and electron (solid line) test particle. The plasma
and/or particle parameters are taken equal to T = 100 eV, n0 = 1018 cm−3,
υ/ωpe = 0.01, and λ = 10. As it follows from Fig. 3, ELR oscillates as a
function of magnetic ﬁeld and many times exceeds the usual Bohr ELR.

5 SUMMARY

The purpose of this work was to analyze the energy loss rate (ELR) of a charged
particle in a magnetized classical plasma. Larmor rotation of a test particle in
a magnetic ﬁeld was taken into account. A general expression obtained for ELR
was analyzed in three particular cases: in a Maxwellian plasma under a strong
magnetic ﬁeld; in a cold plasma when the particle moves along the magnetic
ﬁeld; and in a cold plasma when the particle moves across the magnetic ﬁeld.
The energy loss in a Maxwellian plasma, both in the presence of a strong
magnetic ﬁeld and in its absence, is conditioned by the induced plasma waves.
In the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld, the dispersion of plasma oscillations
is perceptibly altered. From the expression (10) one may see that the frequency
and the damping rate of these waves depend on the direction of spreading
relative to the magnetic ﬁeld. The maximal frequency of these waves is reached
when they are spread along the magnetic ﬁeld. Across the magnetic ﬁeld, they
cannot be spread. It can be noticed that for the electron plasma oscillations,
these eﬀects are analyzed in detail in Refs. [17,27,28].

From the results obtained in Sec.

IV, one may conclude that the ELR
essentially depends on the particle’s incident angle with respect to magnetic
ﬁeld.
In the case of longitudinal motion (ϑ = 0), the ELR is less than or
comparable with Bohr’s result, and in the limit of strong magnetic ﬁelds, ELR
depends only on the density of the plasma. When the particle moves across the
magnetic ﬁeld (ϑ = π/2), the latter essentially aﬀects the ELR value. First,
ELR has an oscillatory character of dependence on a magnetic ﬁeld, becoming
maximal at integer values of parameter b = ωp/Ωc (the ratio of Larmor circle
length and plasma wave wavelength). Second, ELR in the magnetized plasma
at ϑ = π/2 is much greater than the Bohr result. Third, the strong dependence
of ELR on the mass of the test particle can be seen when the magnetic ﬁeld
is suﬃciently strong. If thermal motion of plasma electrons is considered, the
IV will be preserved in general. However, the new
results obtained in Sec.
eﬀects related to the increased number of normal plasma modes will originate.
In particular, at ϑ = π/2, the new mechanism of stopping could be expected,
namely stopping by excitation of the Bernstein oscillations [21].

APPENDIX

Let us examine the properties of function Qν(s) determined by Eq. (34).
To ﬁnd the asymptotic value of that function at s
1 and s > ν, we partition
the area of integration in Eq. (34) into areas x < ν and ν < x < s and use the
asymptotic presentation of the Bessel function at x > ν [29]. Thus, we ﬁnd

this case, the Bessel function is exponentially small, and at a ﬁxed value of s,
Qν(s) exponentially vanishes as ν increases.

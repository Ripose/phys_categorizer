Abstract

Starting from the non-relativistic Pauli description of spin 1

2 particles, a set of ﬂuid
equations, governing the dynamics of such particles interacting with external ﬁelds and
other particles, is derived. The equations describe electrons, positrons, holes, and similar
conglomerates. In the case of electrons, the magnetohydrodynamic limit of an electron–ion
plasma is investigated as well as the case of plasmas containing dust particles. The results
should be of interest and relevance both to laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.

Introduction

The concept of a magnetoplasma has attracted interest ever since ﬁrst introduced by Alfv´en [1],
who showed the existence of waves in magnetized plasmas. Since then, magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) has grown into a vast and mature ﬁeld of science, with applications ranging from solar
physics and astrophysical dynamos, to fusion plasmas and dusty laboratory plasmas.

Meanwhile, a growing interest in what is known as quantum plasmas has appeared (see,
e.g., [2, 3]). Here a main line of research can be found starting from the Schr¨odinger description
of the electron. Assuming that the wave function can be factorized 1, one may derive a set of
ﬂuid equation for the electrons, starting either from an N -body description, a density matrix
description, or a Madelung (or Bohm) description of the wave function(s) [2, 4]. As in classical
ﬂuid mechanics, the set of equations may be closed by a suitable assumption concerning the
thermodynamical relation between quantities. These descriptions of the electron ﬂuid, and
its interaction with ions and charged dust particles, has been shown to ﬁnd applications in
many diﬀerent settings [5–14]. Part of the literature has been motivated by recent experimental
progress and techniques [15–17].

Indeed, from the experimental perspective, a certain interest has been directed towards the
relation of spin properties to the classical theory of motion (see, e.g., [18–30]). In particular,
the eﬀects of strong ﬁelds on single particles with spin has attracted experimental interest in
the laser community [21–26]. However, the main objective of these studies was single particle
dynamics, relevant for dilute laboratory systems, whereas our focus will be on collective eﬀects.
Moreover, strong external magnetic ﬁelds can be found in astrophysical environments such as

pulsar [31, 32] and magnetars [33]. Therefore, a great deal of interest has been directed towards
ﬁnding good descriptions of quantum plasmas in such environments [34–37]. Thus, there is
ample need and interest in developing models that are suitable for a wide range of applications,
taking into account collective eﬀects in multi-particle systems.

Inspired by both the historic and recent progress on quantum plasmas, a complete set of
multi-ﬂuid spin plasma equations was presented in Ref. [3].
In the current paper, we show,
starting from the non-relativistic Pauli equation for spin 1
2 particles, how a set of plasma equa-
tions can be derived for such spin 1
2 particles. These particles may constitute electrons, positrons
(albeit non-relativistic), holes, or similar. Allowing these to interact with ions or charged dust
particles, as well as other spin 1
2 particles, gives the desired governing dynamics of spin plasmas.
We furthermore derive the appropriate magnetohydrodynamic description for such quantum
plasmas, and investigate the eﬀects of charged dust particles on the spin plasma dynamics. The
limitations and suitable parameter ranges of the derived governing equations are discussed. The
results should be of interest for both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.

The non-relativistic evolution of spin 1

particle’s magnetic moment, σ = (σ1, σ2, σ3) the Pauli spin matrices, φ the electrostatic poten-
tial, and (α) enumerates the wave functions. For the electron the magnetic moment is given
by µB = −e~/2mec. From now on, we will assume that µ(α) ≡ µ ≡ q~/2mc The Pauli spin

Next we introduce the decomposition of the spinors as

where n(α) is the density, S(α) is the phase, and ϕ(α) is the 2-spinor through which the spin 1

properties are mediated. Multiplying the Pauli equation (1) by Ψ †
(α), inserting the decomposition
(3), and taking the gradient of the resulting phase evolution equation, we obtain the continuity
and moment conservation equation

We note that the particles are coupled via Maxwell’s equations.

Suppose that we have N wave functions for the same particle species with mass m, magnetic
moment µ, and charge q, and that the total system wave function can be described by the
factorization Ψ = Ψ(1)Ψ(2) . . . Ψ(N ). Then we deﬁne the total particle density for the species with
charge q according to

N

nq =

pαn(α),

X(α)=1
where pα is the probability related to the wave function Ψ(α). Using the ensemble average
α pα(n(α)/nq)f (for any tensorial quantity f ), the total ﬂuid velocity for charges q is
hf i =
Vq = hv(α)i and the total spin density is S = hs(α)i. From these deﬁnitions we can deﬁne the
microscopic velocity in the ﬂuid rest frame according to w(α) = v(α) − V , satisfying hw(α)i = 0,
and the microscopic spin density S (α) = s(α) − S, such that hS (α)i = 0.

The coupling between the quantum plasma species is mediated by the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
By deﬁnition we let Btot include spin sources, i.e. Btot ≡ B + Bsp, such that Amp`ere’s law in
terms of Btot reads

∇ × Btot = µ0(j + jsp) +

,

including the magnetization spin current jsp = ∇ × (2nqµS/~). We obtain consistency with
the momentum conservation equation (13) by adding a term proportional to V × Bsp to the
Lorentz force, where Bsp = µ0jsp, and subtracting it from the quantum force, i.e. we substitute

The above alterations are only reshuﬄing of terms. However, a diﬀerence do appear when closing
the system using Faraday’s law. By letting

FQ → FQ − V × Bsp

∇ × E = −

∂Btot

,

using Btot instead of B, we indeed obtain a diﬀerence compared to the classical system, since
now the spin sources are included.

3 Electron–ion plasma and the magnetohydrodynamic limit

The preceding analysis applies equally well to electrons as holes or similar condensations. We
will now assume that the quantum particles are electrons, thus q = −e, where e is the magnitude
of the electron charge. By the inclusion if the ion species, which are assumed to be described
by the classical equations and have charge Ze, we may derive a set of one- ﬂuid equations. The
ion equations read

Next we deﬁne the total mass density ρ ≡ (mene + mini), the centre-of-mass ﬂuid ﬂow veloc-
ity V ≡ (meneVe + miniVi)/ρ, and the current density j = −eneVe + ZeniVi. Using these
denﬁnitions, we immediately obtain

from Eqs. (12) and (20). Assuming quasi-neutrality, i.e. ne ≈ Zni, the momentum conservation

where Π is the tracefree pressure tensor in the centre-of-mass frame, P is the scalar pressure in the
centre-of-mass frame, and the collisional contributions cancel due to momentum conservation.
We also note that due to quasi-neutrality, we have ne = ρ/(me + mi/Z) and Ve = V − mij/Zeρ,
and we can thus express the quantum terms in terms of the total mass density ρ, the centre-of-
mass ﬂuid velocity V , and the current j. With this, the spin transport equation (14) reads

We then note that even if Q is small, the magnetic ﬁeld may, through the dynamo equation

where η is the resistivity. Here we have omitted the anisotropic part of the pressure, and
neglected terms of order me/mi compared with unity.

The electron inertia term is negligible unless the electron velocity is much larger than the ion
velocity. Thus whenever electron inertia is important, we include only the electron contribution
to the current, and use Amp`ere’s law to substitute Ve = ∇×B/eneµ0 into the term proportional
to me in (26), which gives the ﬁnal form of the Generalized Ohm’s law

Note, however, that the quantum force including the spin eﬀects still should be kept in the
momentum equation (23). Equations (22), (23), and (27) together with the spin evolution
equation (24), which is needed to determine FQ as well as Bsp, constitutes the basic equations.
In order to close the system equations of state for the pressure as well as for the spin state are
needed, as will be discussed in section 5.

4 Dusty plasmas

With the general setting established above, we will from now on focus on the case of a three-
component dusty plasma, for which we have an isotropic pressure with the equation of state Ps =
kBTsns, where the temperature is a constant and kB is Boltzmann’s constant. Thus, the plasma
is composed of electrons (e), ions (i), and dust particles (d). The mass md of the dust particles
is assumed to be much larger than the electron and ion masses, viz. me and mi, respectively.
We will assume that the plasma is approximately quasi-neutral, i.e. qini = ene − qdnd.

4.1 Dust dominated case

First, we focus on a dust-dominated plasma where the dust particle give the main contribution
to the mass density. Due to the constraint me, mi ≪ md the momentum conservation equation
for the inertialess electrons and ions becomes

and

0 = −kBTe∇ne − ene(E + Ve × B) + FQ,

0 = −kBTi∇ni + qini(E + Vi × B),

respectively. Adding Eqs. (29) and (30) to the momentum equation of the dust particles,

(cid:19)

using the quasineutrality condition, assuming that the number densities of the electrons and
ions are not much larger than the number density of the dust, and using the heavy dust approx-
imation, the dust momentum equation takes the form

4.2 Inﬁnitely heavy dust

For timescales much shorter than the inverse dust cyclotron frequency (qdB0/md)−1, the dust
grains can be considered as immobile, and the situation is similar to ordinary MHD, except that
the dust particles contribute with a constant charge background. Combining Eqs. (21) and (29),
and assuming the plasma to be quasineutral, that is qini − ene − qdnd = 0, we obtain

5 Closing the system

The momentum equation, Ohm’s (generalized) law and the continuity equation need to be
completed by an equation of state for the pressure. As is well-known, rigorous derivations of
the equation of state is only applicable in special cases of limited applicability to real plasmas.
Useful models include a scalar pressure where the pressure is proportional to some power of the
density, i.e.

(cid:18)

nγs
s (cid:19)
where d/dt = ∂/∂t + Vs · ∇ is the convective derivative and γs is the ratio of speciﬁc heats,
which in general can be diﬀerent for diﬀerent species s. Secondly, we note that the magnitude
of the terms that are quadratic in the spin depends highly on the spatial scale of the variations.
In MHD, the scale lengths are typically longer or equal to the Larmor radius of the heavier
particles, which means that the terms that are quadratic in S can be neglected in the expression
for the quantum force FQ as well as in the spin evolution equation (24). To lowest order, the
spin inertia can be neglected for frequencies well below the electron cyclotron frequency. Also
omitting the spin-thermal coupling term, which is small for the same reasons as stated above,
the spin-vector is determined from

(37)

which has a solution

(cid:18)
consistent with standard thermodynamic theories of paramagnetism. Here B denotes the mag-
nitude of the magnetic ﬁeld, and η(x) is the Langevin function

B is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. In this approximation the spin

and
evolution equation (24) can be dropped, and the quantum force can be written

where the second term comes from the spin. Furtermore, we note that the spin eﬀects con-
tributes to Bsp, as determined by the spin current jsp = ∇ × (2neµBS/~) together with Eq.
(39). Combining the approximations presented in this section together with the MHD equations
presented in section 3, or either of the two dust systems presented in section 4, closed systems
are obtained.

Illustrative example

Let us next consider the general dust dominated case with an isotropic scalar pressure. Thus
the dynamics is described by the dust dominated equations (32), (33) and (34) and the system is
closed using the approximations outlined in section 5. Next we let B = B0
z +S1,
n = n0 + n1, where index 0 denotes the equilibrium part and index 1 denote the perturbation,
and we have assumed that the equilibrium part of the velocity is zero. Linearizing around the
equilibrium, Fourier decomposing, and omitting the non-spin part of the quantum force [39], we
ﬁnd that the general dispersion relation can be written

modiﬁes the usual propagation properties for each of the solutions in case χ & 1, i.e. if we have
a low-temperature strongly magnetized plasma. As a speciﬁc example we consider the regime of
almost perpendicular propagation, and assume the ordering ω ∼ kzcAd, ω ≪ ωcd, k⊥csd ∼ ωcd,
and let the plasma beta be smaller than unity, i.e. csd ≪ cAd, but allow for χc2

7 Summary and Discussion

In the present paper we have derived one-Fluid MHD equations for a number of diﬀerent plasmas
including the eﬀects of the electron spin, starting from the Pauli equation for the individual parti-
cles. In particular we have derived Spin-MHD-equations for an ordinary electron-ion plasma, for
a dust-dominated plasma, and for an electron-ion plasma with a background of inﬁnitely heavy

8

charged dust particles. Furthermore, the general equations derived in section 2 constitutes a
basis for an electron–positron plasma description including spin eﬀects. A major reason to study
dusty plasmas in connection with spin, is that dusty plasmas can sustain weakly damped modes
with low phase velocities [38], and quantum and spin eﬀects tend to be important in this regime.
To obtain closure of the system, our equations needs to be supplemented by equations of
state for the pressure as well as for the spin pressure. In the MHD regime, a rather simple way
to achieve this closure has been discussed in Section 5, where we assume that the scale lengths
are long enough such terms that are quadratic in the spin vector as well as the spin-thermal
coupling are neglected. However, we here note that if more elaborate models are used, the spin
pressure together with the spin-thermal coupling might play an important role in the generalized
Ohms’s law (27).

Since the spin-coupling give raise to a parallel force (to the magnetic ﬁeld) in the momentum
equation, the parallel electric ﬁeld will not be completely shielded even for zero temperature,
contrary to ordinary MHD. As an immediate consequence, the spin-coupling can give rise to
In this paper we have limited ourselves to present a single

example, linear wave propagation in a dust-dominated plasma, and shown the modiﬁcation of
the dispersion relation due to the spin eﬀects. In particular we note that the spin eﬀects are
important for ~ωce/mev2
for low temperature and/or strongly magnetized
plasmas. Studies involving the spin dynamics through the spin evolution equation (14), kinetic
eﬀects associated with the spin, as well as nonlinear spin dynamics are projects for future work.

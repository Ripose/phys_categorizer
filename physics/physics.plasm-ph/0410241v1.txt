Abstract.

One of the main objectives of the LHD is to extend the plasma conﬁnement
database for helical systems and to demonstrate such extended plasma conﬁnement
properties to be sustained in steady state. Among the various plasma parameter
regimes, the study of conﬁnement properties in the collisionless regime is of particular
importance. Electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) has been extensively used
for these conﬁnement studies of the LHD plasma from the initial operation. The
system optimizations including the modiﬁcation of the transmission and antenna
system are performed with the special emphasis on the local heating properties. As
the result, central electron temperature of more than 10 keV with the electron density
of 0.6 × 1019 m−3 is achieved near the magnetic axis. The electron temperature
proﬁle is characterized by a steep gradient similar to those of an internal transport
barrier observed in tokamaks and stellarators. 168 GHz ECRH system demonstrated
eﬃcient heating at over the density more than 1.0 × 1020 m−3. CW ECRH system is
successfully operated to sustain 756 s discharge.

1. Introduction

2

Electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) plasmas have been extensively used for
the conﬁnement study from the initial operation of the LHD, where, extending the
plasma conﬁnement database of helical systems and demonstrating real steady state
plasma conﬁnement are its main subjects [1, 2].

Recently, the ECRH system is upgraded to operate four 168 GHz, two 84 GHz,
and two 82.7 GHz gyrotrons, simultaneously. An 84 GHz CPD diode CW gyrotron
with diamond window is also operated to perform long pulse discharge. As the result of
system optimizations, including those of injection focal points, and polarizations, central
electron temperature of more than 10 keV with the electron density of 0.6 × 1019 m−3
is achieved near the magnetic axis[3]. The electron temperature proﬁle is characterized
by a steep gradient similar to those of an internal transport barrier (ITB) observed in
tokamaks and stellarators. The extension of the plasma parameter in such low collisional
regime accelerated the study on the structure formation of the electron temperature and
its relation to the radial electric ﬁeld expected from neoclassical transport theory and
resultant ITB in the LHD[4].

Opposite direction to the low density high temperature ECRH is high density
heating. The eﬀect of heating is conﬁrmed up to the 1.5 × 1020 m−3 . Second harmonic
ECRH at 168 GHz is proven to be eﬀective for such high density, where the fundamental
ECRH at 84 GHz is not accessible due to the cutoﬀ.

Continuous or the long time sustainment of the plasma is another important
missions for the LHD. The ECRH system is upgraded to demonstrate the continuous
plasma sustainment in LHD. This upgrade includes setting and operation of 84 GHz
CW gyrotron, the enforcement of the cooling for the waveguide transmission line, and
installation of a waveguide antenna system.
Injection of about 70 kW demonstrated
that the plasma with the time and line averaged density of 2.4 × 1017 m−3 could be
sustained for more than 750 sec.

eﬃciency for each line. It should be noted that the transmission eﬃciency for #11 and
#12 are almost 90 %, although the number of miter bends and total path length are
large. After this optimization, the threshold power for the arcing inside the waveguide
appreciably increased. Relatively low eﬃciency for 168 GHz systems (#1-3,#7) and
scatter of the values may be due to the sensitivity of the alignment of the input beam
axis to that of waveguide. Low transmission eﬃciency for 31.75 mm diameter evacuated
waveguides (#4 and #5) may be attributed to the low purity of the coupled HE11 mode.

Since the axis alignment is less critical in the small diameter waveguide system, further
optimization of the MOU mirrors or adjustment of the position of the waveguide mouth
might be necessary. The power from each gyrotron is transmitted through a corrugated
waveguide system and injected by a quasi-optical antenna system. Two sets of U (upper
) port antenna consist of two sets of mirrors for 82.7 and 168 GHz. The antenna mirrors
are designed using the phase constant method assuming Gaussian optics[8]. Designed
beam waist sizes on the mid-plane of LHD are 15 and 50 mm in radial and toroidal
directions, respectively. These values and its steerability on the mid-plane of the LHD

are conﬁrmed by low power test. In each antenna system, ﬁnal plasma facing mirror is
plane mirror and can be steered by remote-controlled super sonic motors around two
axis ( azimuth and elevation angle ).

Due to the complexity of the conﬁgurations of the transmission system, quasi-
optical antenna system, the optimum setting of the antenna angles and polarizer rotation
angles are not straightforward. Furthermore, the deﬁnition of the injection parameters
on the frame of the LHD magnetic conﬁguration is necessary and the actual quick
selection and setting of these angles are required depending on the various experimental
purposes. In order to perform eﬀective local heating by the electron cyclotron waves,
it is necessary to select more eﬀective heating mode on the resonance between two
eigen modes in the plasma. Desired polarization state to excite the eﬀective mode is
determined by the angle between injection and magnetic ﬁeld directions at the interface
of the injected beam to the plasma. The polarization state at the interface is controlled
by the combination of rotation angles of two polarizers and antenna angles. Given
the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration and the magnetic ﬁeld strength, the optimum antenna
setting angles can be determined using a geometrical conﬁguration of the steering
antenna. Once the injection angle of the beam is determined, the local magnetic ﬁeld
strength and the angle between injection and magnetic ﬁeld direction at the interface
of the plasma can be calculated. Using such derived magnetic ﬁeld strength, the
angle and the mode, the necessary polarization state can be calculated by the cold
plasma dispersion relation. This polarization state is projected back to the polarizers
to determine the best combination of the two polarizers.

Fig. 2 a) shows the injection beams, mod-B contours, and ﬂux surfaces in the
vertically elongated poloidal cross section. Two sets of upper beams, one lower beam
from a vertical antenna, and two beams from horizontal antennas are used. In order
to attain high electron temperature at center, the magnetic ﬁeld strength and the

ECRH plasma in the LHD

conﬁnement magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration are selected to have a power deposition as
nearly on-axis as possible. One of the optimum combinations is the magnetic axis at
3.53 m and the toroidally averaged magnetic ﬁeld strength on the axis at 2.951 T. The
expected power deposition proﬁle estimated by ray tracing code, including the weakly
relativistic eﬀect[9, 10], indicates that almost all of the injected power from the upper
and lower antennas are concentrated within an averaged minor radius of ρ ≈ 0.2 as
shown in Fig. 2 b) , here, three cases of diﬀerent injection angle is plotted to see the
allowances and errors in antenna setting. Lower traces are integrated absorption power.
Almost 100% power absorption can be expected in the density, and temperature regime
discussed in this paper, provided that the beams crosses the resonance in the plasma
conﬁnement region and proper injection polarization state is selected.

3. Low collisionality regime

The magnetic ﬁeld at the magnetic axis is eﬀectively increased by shifting the axis inward
(Raxis=3.5 - 3.6) from the standard position( Raxis= 3.75 m ) to locate the cyclotron
layer across the axis. The injection beam aligned carefully, to hit the resonance on
the magnetic axis. As a result, ECH beams were concentrated near the shifted axis.
For the on-axis heating, strongly focussed Gaussian beams at the fundamental and
second harmonic resonances are directed to the resonances near the magnetic axis. The
microwave sources used in this case were 84 GHz, two 82.7 GHz, and three 168 GHz
gyrotrons. Fig. 2 shows the injection beams, Mod-B contours, and ﬂux surfaces in the
vertically elongated poloidal cross section. Two sets of upper and one lower beams from
a vertical antenna, and two beams from horizontal antennas are used. The magnetic ﬁeld
strength and the conﬁguration are selected to have power deposition as nearly on-axis
as possible. The selected magnetic axis is 3.53 m and the toroidally averaged magnetic
ﬁeld strength on the axis is 2.951 T. The expected power deposition proﬁle is shown in
Fig. 2. Fig. 3 a) shows the evolution of plasma parameters and temperature proﬁles
when the central electron Te0 exceeded 10 keV. The time evolution of the injected total
power, the electron density, and the stored energy are shown here for the shot when
the highest central electron temperature is recorded in the LHD. Almost 1.2 MW ECH
power is concentrated inside ρ ≈ 0.2. The electron density is slightly increasing but
stays 0.5 to 0.6 × 1019m−3 in this case.

The two 84 GHz gyrotrons injected 0.7 MW to produce and heat the plasma. After
the density and the stored energy had attained a quasi- steady state, the 168 GHz and
82.7 GHz power are added simultaneously. Although no additional gas puﬀ is supplied,
the density keeps increasing slightly. A high power YAG-Thomson scattering system
is used at the times indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3 a). The proﬁle is already sharp
in the phase when only the 84 GHz power is injected. The 82.7 GHz power raises the
central electron temperature to more than 10 keV. These high electron temperature
modes appear only when the injected power exceeds a certain threshold level, and this
threshold level increases with the electron density. Figure 4 shows the dependence

of the local electron temperature at ρ = 0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 on the averaged electron
density under the same injection condition. Since the expected power deposition and
the deposition proﬁles do not change signiﬁcantly, the sharp increase in the electron
temperature at ρ = 0, 0.2 suggests the presence of some non-linear mechanism. The
feet of the ITB are more prominent when the ECH is applied on counter NBI target
plasma. It is clear that the threshold power depends on the electron density. Other
observations with respect to the ITB are as follows: 1) The power deposition proﬁle
plays an important role in the formation of the ITB. The total deposited power inside
ρ < 0.2 seems the key factor. 2) Reduction of the ion and impurity transport after the
ITB formation are suggested from impurity observations.
indicates the presence of a
positive electric ﬁeld. 3) The location of the feet of the ITB depends on the direction of
the NBI, which may be related to the position of the rational surface ι/2π= 0.5[12]. The
ι/2π =0.5 surface plays an important role in expanding this interface outside. The clear
ITB or foot point near ρ = 0.2 to 0.3 is observed in the case of counter NBI as a target
plasma for ECRH. The slope of the temperature proﬁle gradually increases and clear
foot point disappears in the case of co-NBI. 4) The density and electron temperature
region of electron root predicted from neoclassical theory coincides with the region where
the ITB appears.

These facts support the proposed anomalous transport reduction mechanism which
the radial electric ﬁeld shear reduces the ﬂuctuation level and the shear itself is formed
by the radial interface between electron and ion roots [5]. The details of the formation
of the ITB is under study using heat pulse propagation. Here, the ITB is formed
mainly by high power fundamental heating (84 and 82.7 GHz ) and the modulated
second harmonic heating is used as a perturbation source. The drastic diﬀerence in the
transient transport between with and without ITB is observed. The time lag of the heat

ECRH plasma in the LHD

pulse propagation clearly changes across the ITB region. This analysis is also enabled
by the optimization of the modulating 168 GHz injection parameter.

The forward and backward transitions between ITB and normal conﬁnement
occurred when a part of the ECRH power is turned oﬀ and on to cross the threshold
power for the ITB[4]. The decay time of the central temperature just after crossing
down the threshold power is apparently long and high temperature gradient is kept for
60 ms. On the other hand, the decay time is short when the ECRH power kept below
threshold. When the power increased stepwise crossing the threshold, high temperature
gradient region grows gradually and the temperature proﬁle jumps to form ITB about
40 ms after the stepwise increase. These results suggest that the temperature gradient
helps to lower the threshold power for ITB formation[14].

4. High Density ECH

Second harmonic high frequency ECH is attractive because of its high density limit. The
second harmonic heating system at 168 GHz for 3 T has been prepared to perform high
density plasma heating. Second harmonic heating has its advantage in the accessibility
in the high density region. Clear and deﬁnite demonstration of the eﬀect is the increase
of stored energy at the high density above the cut oﬀ of 84 GHz fundamental heating.
The cut oﬀ density of 84 GHz fundamental O mode is 0.88 × 1020 m−3 while that of 168
GHz second harmonic X mode is 1.75 × 1020 m−3. Actually, 168 GHz ECRH power is
applied on the high density, high stored energy plasma and helped to sustain and push
highest record value. In Fig. 5 a) is shown the wave forms of the shot where the highest
stored energy is recorded in LHD. Three negative ion source NB are injected step by
step and the repetitive pellet is injected to increase the density. The total injected
NB power attained 9 MW in this shot. The line averaged density once reaches 2.0 ×
1020 m−3 and decreases with the time constant of 0.5 s. The 168 GHz power of the
level of 800 kW in total is applied on such high density plasma. dependence of heating
eﬃciency of 168 GHz on target plasma density. The heating eﬃciency is estimated from
the diﬀerence of the time derivative of stored energy just before and after the turning on
and oﬀ time of 168 GHz pulse. Figure 5 b) shows such estimated heating eﬃciency as
a function of line-averaged density. Diﬀerence of the mark corresponds to the timing of
turing on and oﬀ for stored energy. Appreciable heating eﬀect is observed for the shots
of the averaged electron density above 1.0 × 1020 m−3. Although the degradation of
the eﬃciency appears above 1.0 × 1020 m−3, heating eﬃciency of near 30% is observed
near the right hand cutoﬀ density of 1.75 × 1020 m−3. Highest eﬃciency point for 1.7
and 1.2 × 1020 m−3 just corresponds to the turn on and oﬀ data from Fig. 5 a). This
ﬁgure clearly shows the eﬀectiveness of second harmonic heating.

5. Long Pulse Operation

Demonstration of steady state high Te plasma sustainment is important from the
view point of extending the helical magnetic conﬁnement device to the fusion reactor.
Technical issue in the CW ECH system is also important in the next step fusion
device as ITER. Especially, the heat removal around gyrotron, MOU and transmission
components are of critical issues. Development of low loss and safety component is
required. Management of heat ﬂux into the diverter and ﬁrst wall, plasma density,
temperature and particle control and sustainment in the steady state condition are to
be established. A CW gyrotron with the diamond window at the frequency of 84 GHz
is introduced to perform the steady state plasma sustainment in LHD. This gyrotron is
connected to one of the evacuated corrugated waveguide systems of 31.75 mm id. (#5)
listed in Table 1.

ECRH plasma in the LHD

In order to monitor the temperature rise in the waveguide components, multi-
point temperature measurement system is introduced and attached the sensors along
the long transmission line. Since existing focusing antenna for this line had no cooling
capability, a corrugated up taper from 31.75 mm id to 63.5 mm id is connected and
the output beam is directed to a magnetic axis. Because of limited injection power,
gas feed rate is controlled by repetitive pulse puﬀ. Almost all gyrotron parameters
stayed almost constant during 766 sec injection. Collector, body voltages are well
controlled and kept constant during the shot. Beam and body current and little increases
with the time constant of 300 s and then saturates to be constant toward the end of
the pulse. Temperature diﬀerence between inlet and outlet of several channels of the
gyrotron coolant are still a little increasing even after such long pulse operation, but
demonstrated that this gyrotron can be operated more than 1000 s with the power
level at 150 kW. Operation of the interlock on the pressure in the waveguides due to
the excess outgas resulted from the temperature rise had been the major cause of the
termination of the pulse. Out gassing were far from saturation and the pressure kept
increased due to the poor conductance in the waveguide. Figure 6 shows time evolutions
of a) injection power, b) averaged electron density, c) ECE radiation temperature, d)
radiation power and e) temperature rise in waveguide component. The repetitive gas
puﬀ is controlled not to cause radiation collapse. This is the reason why the density,
temperature and radiation ﬂuctuates. In average, plasma with electron density of 2.4
× 1017 m−3, and ECE radiation temperature of 240 eV ( this is not necessarily the
real electron temperature due optically thin) is sustained by 72 kW injection power. It
is noted that the density decay rate just after the gas puﬃng pulse decreases towards
the end of the pulse. This might reﬂect the change of recycling from the wall. It is
necessary to continue the eﬀort to increase the injection power by enforcing the cooling
and pumping of the waveguide.

6. Conclusions

ECRH system have been upgraded step by step to inject total power more than 2 MW.
The optimizations of the injection condition for almost all antennas are performed in
the beam steering angle and also polarization. The power deposition proﬁle is carefully
controlled and utilized to achieve high electron temperature of more than 10 keV and
formation of ITB. Sharp power deposition is also utilized in analyzing and understanding
the transport mechanisms. Second harmonic heating of 168 GHz demonstrated eﬀective
heating at the density of more than 1.5 × 1020 m−3. Long pulse more than 12 minutes
of 70 kW at 84 GHz is injected and sustained the plasma for 756 sec at the averaged
density of 2.4 × 1017 m−3.

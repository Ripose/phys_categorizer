Abstract. To establish the electron energy distribution function (EEDF), the second
derivative of a Langmuir probe current-voltage (I-V) characteristic is numerically
integrated using the Tikhonov singular value decomposition regularized method. A
comparison of the numerically intagrated EDDF and by a least-squares ﬁtting is
discussed. The used I-V characteristic is measured in an ECR plasma source using a
cylindrical probe and the plasma parameters are determined by the Laframboise theory.
This technique allows a rapid analysis of plasma parameters at any gas pressure. The
obtained EEDF, for the case of the ECR plasma source, shows the existence of two
groups of electrons with diﬀerent temperatures. This result is associated with the
collisional mechanism heating taking place in ECR plasma sources, where low pressure
plasma is sustained by electron impact ionization of the ground state molecules or
atoms by energetic electrons arising in the resonance zone.

1. Introduction.

The Langmuir probe is one of the simplest diagnostics tools of the study of ionized
gases. The probe usually consists of a small sphere or a circular cylinder which is placed
in the plasma at the point of interest. Some external circuitry is provided so that the
electric potential of the probe can be varied. A plot of the total current ﬂowing between
the probe and the plasma versus the probe potential is called the current-voltage (I-
V) characteristic. Langmuir probes are highly eﬀective in determining the electron
energy distribution function (EEDF), allowing both spatial and temporal resolution.
The EEDF is given by the second derivative of the probe I-V characteristic.

In recent years, several groups have successfully used the numerical diﬀerentiation of
digital probe trace data. [1, 2, 3]. Yet, numerically, the second derivative is a hard task
and is classiﬁed as an ill-posed problem. Ill-posed problems do not have the properties
of existence, uniqueness and stability [4]. One of the alternatives to solve this problem
is the introduction of the concept of conditional well-posed problems [4]. On the other
hand, the problem of integration of the I-V characteristic has evolved along with the
solution of the Fredholm integral equation of ﬁrst class, which is obtained from the
integration of a second order diﬀerential equation. One of the most stable methods to
solve the Fredholm integral equation are the regularization methods.

In order to characterize the processes occurring in plasmas it is advisable to obtain
the electron energy distribution function with a high degree of accuracy. In particular,
there has been much interest in the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma sources
motivated by their applications in ionized physical vapor deposition techniques (I-PVD)
[5].

In this paper, the second derivative of a Langmuir probe current-voltage (I-V)
characteristic is numerically integrated using the Tikhonov singular value decomposition
(SVD) regularized method in order to establish the EEDF as the most stable method.
The existence of two groups of electrons with diﬀerent temperatures, where low pressure
plasma is sustained by electron impact ionization of the ground state molecules or atoms
by energetic electrons arising in the resonance zone is shown. Also, it is important
to notice that the rate of convergence of the Tikhonov method is much faster than
that achieved with the least-squares with an orthogonal decomposition (LSQR) and
truncated singular value decomposition (TSDV) methods. A comparison between the
EEDF obtained by the Tikhonov regularization method and the one resulting from a
least-squares ﬁtting is discussed.

2. Basic equations.

The electric potential proﬁle near the probe can inﬂuence its current collection by setting
up “barriers of eﬀective potential” around the probe, thereby preventing some particles
from reaching it. This proﬁle can be strongly inﬂuenced by the space charge of the
particles themselves. However, when rp/λD is small enough (the sheath around the probe

is comparatively thick), this barriers disappears, and the current collection is maximized.
The currents collected under these conditions then become the orbit-limited-currents.
This assumption is backed by the orbital motion limit (OML) theory [6] which implies a
rp). Thus, the calculation of Laframboise [6], based on
thick, collisionless sheath (λe ≫
the more complete theory of Berstein and Rabinowitz [7], showed that the OML limit
rp. Here rp is the probe radius (spherical or cylindrical), λD is the

Debye radius, and λe is the electron mean free path, respectively.

When we assume the presence of a stopping ﬁeld (λe > rp > λD), as demonstrated
by Druyvesteyn in [8, 9], the second derivative of the current I with respect to the
voltage V of the probe is proportional to the electron energy distribution function as
follows

Vs), Vp is the probe voltage, Vs is the plasma potential,
where the energy is ε = e(Vp −
I is the electron current to the probe, S is the probe surface area, and m, e are the
electron mass and charge, respectively. The contribution of the ion current to the
second derivative of the probe current is normally insigniﬁcant, and it is therefore not
subtracted in these EEDF calculations.

3. EEDF by the Tikhonov regularization
method.

In order to solve the Fredholm’s ﬁrst class equation (4), the kernel K can be expressed
in the form of an expansion in terms of singular functions ui(x), vi(x), and singular
values ki:

K(x, y) =

kiui(x)vi(y).

n

Xi=1

In the occurrence of symmetry, this reduces itself to an eigenfunction expansion. It is
not necessary that the expansion should converge pointwise; all we require for an L2
kernel is that

As for the ﬁrst term, it is advantageous to make α small in order to reduce the error due
to regularization; by contrast, the second term, which only consists of error, is made
small by taking α large. Thus, there is a conﬂict, and we would like to achieve the best
compromise [11].

4. Least-squares ﬁtting.

In the OML theory of ion collection, the ion current ﬂowing to a negatively biased probe
is independent of the shape of the plasma potential V (r) as long as the current is limited
only by the angular momentum of the orbiting ions [6]. This requires the arbitrary
assumption of either a “sheath edge” s, beyond which the ion energy distribution is
Maxwellian, or a V (r) varying so slowly that no “absorption radius”, inside of which
all ions are drawn in, exists between the probe and inﬁnity. This condition is never
satisﬁed even at modest densities. For s
and a Maxwellian ion distribution at
temperature Ti, the OML current to a cylinder probe is given by

5. Analysis and discussion.

With a view to obtaining accurate values of n, Te and Vs (but not Ti) from the EEDF,
we shall illustrate a procedure using data obtained in an ECR discharge with P = 10
mTorr in argon gas, taken with an rf-compensated cylindrical probe with a radius 0.4
mm and 4 mm in length.

It is considered that the current is collected within the area at the tip of the probe
p, where L is the probe length. The entire I-V curve in

expressed by S = 2πRpL + πR2
this example is shown in ﬁgure 1.

From the Langmuir theory, assuming a Maxwellian distribution for electrons [13],
V curve of ﬁgure 1, that Te = 6.88 eV, Vs = 22.078
we obtain in the case of the I
1016 m−3. Thus, the ﬁrst derivative shown in ﬁgure 1 as well as
V, and ne = 1.39
experimental data are used. Here, it is important to notice that the extremum of the
ﬁrst derivative is not completely well deﬁned, as observed in ﬁgure 1.
The EEDF is calculated following the procedure described in

In ﬁgure 3 the EEDF obtained by the Tikhonov technique of zeroth order is shown,
along with the corresponding values of the regularization parameters α = (0.09, 0.08,
0.07, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02).

From these charts we gather that the most probable energy is Te = 5.66 eV. With
this electron temperature, it is easy to calculate the plasma electron density by the
relation

It is also important to notice that the
maximum value of the EEDF by the Tikhonov regularization method takes the value
1014 m−3 eV−1. After an analysis of several calculations, we can
of F (ε)
say that the bumps observed in the EEDF are related with numerical eﬀects and are
originated by the irregularities of the I-V curve.

These results are validated in the following by a least squares ﬁtting. As it has
been described in

values I 2 versus V curves are plotted [13]. From these charts, we can observe that the
obtained values for the constants show a good agreement with the data values.

Analogously,

for the electronic component in the I-V curve, we now employ
expressions (18) and (19) for a least squares ﬁt to the data. The corresponding
values of constants appearing in (18) and (19) are given in Table 1. Then, we can
express the EEDF as a sum of functions (16)-(17). This distribution is plotted in
ﬁgure 1. Introducing the corresponding dimensions, we obtain a comparison with the
EEDF obtained by the Tikhonov regularization method shown in ﬁgure 3. For the
energetic group of electrons we obtained that Te = 18.831 eV, ne = 8.66E15 m−3, and
|max = 3.42E13 m−3 eV−1. From the least-squares distribution we obtain for the
F (ε)
main group of electrons that the most probable energy is Te = 5.331 eV. The maximum
1015 m−3 eV−1. Considering this value
value found for the EEDF is F (ε)
1016 m−3.
for the temperature Te, we ﬁnd by equation (21) the density ne = 1.62
For the values computed after ﬁtting, it is possible to accomplish the integration of the
adjusted characteristic, to obtain [15, 16]

Here, the related problem of the indetermination of the zero position in the EEDF,

present when no electronic saturation is reached. Several results obtained by applying
the two methods are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3.

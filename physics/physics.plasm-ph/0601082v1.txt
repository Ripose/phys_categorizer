Viscosity and mutual diﬀusion in strongly asymmetric binary ionic mixtures

Sorin Bastea∗
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, P.O. BOX 808, Livermore, CA 94550

We present molecular dynamics simulation results for the viscosity and mutual diﬀusion constant
of a strongly asymmetric binary ionic mixture (BIM). We compare the results with available theo-
retical models previously tested for much smaller asymmetries. For the case of viscosity we propose
a new predictive framework based on the linear mixing rule, while for mutual diﬀusion we discuss
some consistency problems of widely used Boltzmann equation based models.

The important advancements that occurred in the last decade in the experimental techniques involving high-power
lasers have generated a renewed interest in the properties of dense plasmas in general and their transport properties
in particular [1, 2, 3]. The experimental capabilities currently available and the ones that are expected to become
available in the near future [4] promise to further advance the ﬁeld of inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) as well as shed
new light on long-standing astrophysics problems. Many times such experiments either probe, or their outcome is
strongly dependent on, the behavior of plasma mixtures with various degrees of charge and mass asymmetries of the
components. Such mixtures occur for example in ICF due to the instability (e.g. Richtmyer-Meshkov or Rayleigh-
Taylor) driven mixing of the heavy elements that make up the enclosing shell and the much lighter fuel. In this case
the stability of the initial interfaces, nature of the ensuing ﬂows and degree of fuel contamination are crucially linked
to such mixture properties as shear viscosity and mutual diﬀusion [5, 6, 7]. In the present paper we calculate these
properties using molecular dynamics simulations for a simple but relevant plasma model: the binary ionic mixture
(BIM) [8, 9], which is a generalization of the one-component plasma (OCP) [10]. We study a rather extreme, ICF-
inspired system [7], D+
Au39+, which displays roughly two orders of magnitude charge and mass asymmetry, but
the results should apply to other plasma mixtures as well, e.g. of astrophysics signiﬁcance [11], where large charge
and mass asymmetries are present. We compare the MD results with available theoretical models previously tested
for much smaller asymmetries. For the case of viscosity we propose a new predictive framework based on the linear
mixing rule, while for mutual diﬀusion we discuss some consistency problems of Boltzmann equation based models.

The BIM model consists of a mixture of N1 point ions of charge q1 = Z1e and mass M1 and N2 point ions of charge
q2 = Z2e and mass M2 embedded in a uniform, rigid, neutralizing electronic background. We denote the number
concentrations by xα = Nα/N , N = N1 + N2, α = 1, 2 and number densities by ρα = Nα/V , ρ = ρ1 + ρ2, where
V = L3 is the volume.

The thermodynamics of the system is fully determined by one coupling constant, e.g. Γ, and concentration x1. As it

The thermodynamics of the BIM has been thoroughly studied and is known to be very well described by the linear
mixing rule [8, 12, 13, 14]. For moderate charge asymmetries an OCP-based “one-ﬂuid theory” is also a reasonable

approximation [8], with an eﬀective charge Z 2

shown to be suitable for calculating the BIM viscosity at charge and mass asymmetries of order

[18]. In [2] the authors propose a diﬀerent relation based on the kinetic theory of Wallenborn and Baus [19], that
extends to the weak coupling regime. However, the disagreement between these two approaches (Refs. [17] and [2]) is
signiﬁcant in the regime that they both cover, Γ
1, particularly at intermediate Γ’s. Unfortunately it is diﬃcult to
ascertain the reliability of these predictions given both the limited simulation results available and the small system
size used, which limits the accuracy of the results.

We know tackle the question of the BIM viscosity, in particular when the charge and mass asymmetries are very
large. It should be noted that the system that we focus on, D+
Au39+, is not a simple BIM per se, as gold (Au)
is only partially ionized and the eﬀect of the remaining electrons may be important under certain thermodynamic
conditions. However, the BIM approach is still relevant provided the densities and temperatures are such that the
distance of closest approach between ions is larger that the radius of the remaining ion cores.

−

To elucidate the eﬀect on viscosity of mixing plasmas with such large diﬀerences in charge and mass as D+ and
Au39+ it is convenient to adopt the procedure of Ref.
[2], where the coupling constant Γ is kept ﬁxed and the
concentration of the two species is varied. We set Γ = 0.05, which corresponds to Γi = 0.05 for pure deuterium
(xAu = 0), i.e. a weakly coupled plasma, and to Γi
76 for pure gold (xAu = 1), i.e. a strongly coupled plasma. As
before, we perform microcanonical simulations with a system of 1372 particles, at a number of diﬀerent concentrations
xAu. Due to the strong charge and mass asymmetries, exceedingly long run times are necessary for both equilibration
25%. A good measure of the
and data accumulation to calculate the viscosity using Eq. 4 with an accuracy of 20
large “size” diﬀerence between the ions is provided for example by the pair correlation functions, which we show in
Fig. 2 for xAu = 0.5.

≃

−

As noted in [2] the viscosity drops steeply upon mixing highly charged, heavy ions in a weakly coupled plasma,
see Fig. 3. This eﬀect can be understood qualitatively in the framework of a “one-ﬂuid” theory, which we describe
below. The coupling constant of the equivalent OCP is Γef f = ΓZ 2
3 follows from the
ion-sphere model [15]. In this approximation the thermodynamics is fully determined by Γef f , but the calculation of
the viscosity requires some additional arguments. For example, a reasonable unit for the viscosity of this system may
be assumed to be ηm
is the “hydrodynamic” plasma
mixture frequency. (The use of the so-called “kinetic” mixture frequency [25] leaves the results largely unchanged).
The mixture viscosity in these units is then postulated to be given by the scaled eﬀective-OCP viscosity:

We show in Fig. 3 the results of such calculations for the system that we study, using both the OCP viscosity of
Ref. [2], and our prediction Eq. 11. The qualitative dependence of the MD results on xAu, arising from the opposite
behaviors of ηOCP (Γef f ) and ηm
0 (x), is reproduced correctly, but the quantitative disagreement is also very signiﬁcant,
particularly for small and moderate Au concentrations. The use of the more accurate OCP viscosity Eq. 11 does not
fully alleviate this problem. We conclude that, not surprisingly, the accuracy of the “one-ﬂuid” model is diminished
for extreme asymmetries.

It is clear that this limitation can only be overcome by taking into account, either explicitly or implicitly, the
mixture asymmetry. A direct calculation along the lines of the kinetic theory of Wallenborn and Baus [19] has
been used for example to determine the BIM mutual diﬀusion constant at small asymmetries [26]. However, the
calculation of the viscosity is even more complex and given the limitations of the theory even for the OCP its success
for BIM quantitative predictions is rather doubtful. We turn therefore to a more indirect method, which we outline
below. First, we recall an interesting and much studied property of binary ionic mixtures, the linear mixing rule
[8, 12, 13, 14]. Hansen et al. have pointed out that the excess internal energy of the BIM, u = Uex/N kBT , is very
acurately represented as a linear combination of the excess energies of two one-component plasmas with the same
electronic coupling constant Γ′ as the BIM (and ionic charges Z1e and Z2e), i.e. the mixing of the two components
at the same temperature and electronic density is largely ideal:

≪

We ﬁnd that this rule is satisﬁed at very large asymmetries as well, with the largest relative deviations occurring
at Γ′
1, i.e. small Au concentrations, in agreement with [8]. Given this nearly ideal mixing behavior we assume
that other system properties, e.g. viscosity, are bracketed by the component values as well. For an interpolation
relation between the viscosities of the two OCP’s at a given composition we now borrow some concepts from the
linear transport theory of composite media. A common situation encountered in such systems is that of “impurities”
with a generalized conductivity α1 and total volume fraction φ1 randomly dispersed in a matrix α2. Under these
circumstances the eﬀective medium theory [27] employs a mean-ﬁeld like, self-consistent approximation to predict the
medium conductivity on scales much larger than those of the inhomogeneities. For the case of viscosity this yields
[28] for the eﬀective medium viscosity ηm:

We now note that the BIM is obtained by combining one-component plasmas with volume fractions φi = Zixi/

and use the above relation to predict the mixture viscosity, essentially assuming that the theory applies for atomically

sized “impurity” domains. Using Eq. 11 for the individual OCP viscosities η1 and η2 we obtain the results shown in
Fig. 3.

The degree of agreement with the simulation results is fairly remarkable. This may lead one to believe that the
system is perhaps thermodynamically unstable and separating into two OCP phases [8]. However, we ﬁnd no evidence
for such a scenario and conclude that the decoupling signaled by the linear mixing rule along with the tremendous
asymmetry between the ions lead to behavior mimicking that of a macroscopically mixed system.

We now turn to the case of ionic interdiﬀusion in the BIM. Mutual diﬀusion in plasma mixtures plays an important
role in the prediction of stellar structure [29], as well as the stability of ICF targets [5]. For the case of a binary mixture
the mutual diﬀusion coeﬃcient D12 can be calculated in terms of the ﬂuctuations of the microscopic interdiﬀusion
current [30]:

relation is a good estimate for x1x2

mixtures modeled as BIM by making use of the Chapman-Enskog solution method [24]. The authors further argue
that screened potentials, ZiZje2exp(
r/λ)/r, are better suited for such estimates than the pure Coulomb interaction.
In order to extend the validity of this approach to strong couplings they propose as appropriate screening distance λ

calculations for the D+
Au39+ mixture using the slightly better second Enskog approximation [32]. The outcome,
see Fig. 4, reproduces rather well the MD simulation results for D0
0.1, but not the mutual diﬀusion
coeﬃcient D12. This is an important point that merits further discussion. In fact, there is no reason to expect that
Chapman-Enskog estimates based on the Boltzmann equation for the ions can reproduce the full D12 for either pure
Coulomb interactions (with some reasonable cut-oﬀ) or screened potentials. As shown in [26] for low density plasmas or
2 only arises when the electronic background is explicitly taken into
more generally here, the prefactor value
i
account either through its ambipolar ﬁeld in a dilute plasma kinetic description [26] or simply at the thermodynamic
level in the context of the linear mixing rule. No such eﬀect is included when the standard Boltzmann equation, which
is consistent with ideal gas thermodynamics, is used to model the dynamics of the ions. Therefore it is reasonable
to expect that such approaches can only provide estimates of the Green-Kubo part, i.e. D0
12, of the mutual diﬀusion
constant, as already evidenced by our simulation results and perhaps not fully appreciated before. We note however
that the prefactor value quoted above may be a good approximation only for rs
0. For real systems, e.g. those
encountered in ICF or astrophysics problems, rs departs signiﬁcantly from zero and the electronic pressure and
polarization eﬀects can lead to phase separation [8, 33], especially at high asymmetries. The thermodynamic quantity
(∂2(βG/N )/∂x2
1)P,T is connected to the spinodal decomposition line of the plasma mixture [33], and therefore proper
estimates require careful calculations. In particular, it was pointed out in [33] that it is not suﬃcient to consider a
BIM with compressible but non-polarizable electronic background since a consistent treatment can only be achieved
with an appropriate modeling of electronic screening.

The apparent failure at low Au concentrations of the screened potentials method proposed by Paquette et al. may
appear at ﬁrst puzzling since as xAu decreases so does the eﬀective coupling constant Γef f , and therefore the accuracy
of the theory should in principle only increase. We note however that this also requires λD > a, which for our system
10−3. In fact, although not easily seen in Fig. 4, the theoretical values drop
and chosen Γ means xAu no bigger than
sharply for such compositions to values close to the MD result at the lowest simulated Au concentration, xAu = 0.03.
For this composition the screening distance a, although larger than λD, appears to be too small. This is perhaps not
unexpected given that due to the signiﬁcant separation between the highly-charged ions they are primarily screened
by the small ions and the electronic background, which requires distances signiﬁcantly larger than a when the charge
asymmetry is very large.

≈

In summary, we have investigated using molecular dynamics simulations the viscosity and mutual diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cients of a plasma model known as the binary ionic mixture (BIM) when the asymmetry is very strong. We discuss in
light of the MD results important shortcomings of widely used theoretical models at large asymmetries. For viscosity,
an OCP-based “one-ﬂuid” theory proves inadequate for quantitative predictions and we propose a new method based
on the linear mixing rule. A commonly employed model of ionic interdiﬀusion based on the Boltzmann equation
compares reasonable well with the simulation results, but we point out that it provides only part of the mutual
diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The missing thermodynamic piece may be particularly important for large asymmetries and low
concentrations of highly-charged ions, situations often encountered in both ICF and astrophysics applications. Finally,
calculations that take into account electronic polarization eﬀects are currently under way and will be reported in a
future publication.

[31] The qualitative behavior of the thermodynamic prefactor remains unchanged (but its values are even higher) if deviations
from the linear mixing rule are taken into account and estimated using the relation proposed in Ref. [12] (the present
charge assymmetry is however larger than the ones studied in [12]).

The formalism of frozen-in vortex lines for two-dimensional (2D) ﬂows in ideal incompressible
electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) is formulated. A localized approximation for nonlinear
dynamics of two close sheets of the generalized vorticity is suggested and its integrability by the
hodograph method is demonstrated.

I. GENERAL REMARKS

This work is devoted to analytical study of ideal incom-
pressible EMHD ﬂows (see, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and
references therein about EMHD and its applications).
Our primary goal here is to consider a simpliﬁed 1D prob-
lem that has many similar qualitative properties with the
problem about attractive interaction of two distributed
currents in 2D ideal EMHD, that was numerically simu-
lated recently with a high resolution [9]. More precisely,
we introduce and partially analyse local approximations
for particular class of the 2D ideal EMHD ﬂows, that are
reduced in mathematical sense to dynamics of a single
or few 1D objects, the vortex lines. The most interest-
ing result of present work is the demonstration of exact
solvability by the known hodograph method of long-scale
dynamics in the unstable vortex structure constituted by
two nearly anti-parallel sheets of the generalized vorticity
in 2D ideal EMHD.

As known, the EMHD model approximately describes
dynamics of the low-inertial electron component of
plasma in situations when the heavy ion component is
almost motionless and serves just to provide a neutraliz-
ing background for electrically charged electron ﬂuid and
to keep a constant concentration n of the electrons. The
(divergence-free in this case) electric current −env(r, t)
creates the quasi-stationary magnetic ﬁeld,

which contributes to the generalized electron vorticity,

The most simple way how to derive the ideal EMHD
equation of motion is just to use the well known fact
that the generalized vorticity in an ideal homogeneous
ﬂuid is frozen-in,

Ωt = curl [v × Ω] .

II. VORTEX LINE REPRESENTATION OF 2D
IDEAL EMHD

Our analytical approach is based on the representation
of ideal EMHD in terms of frozen-in lines of the general-
ized vorticity Ω(r, t), as described, for instance, in [7, 10].
The general form (4) of equation of motion allows one to
represent the ﬁeld Ω(r, t) through the shapes of frozen-in
vortex lines (the so called formalism of vortex lines),

Ω(r, t) =

d2ν

δ(r − R(ν, ξ, t))Rξ(ν, ξ, t)dξ,

(7)

ZN

I

where δ(. . .) is the 3D delta-function, N is some ﬁxed 2D
manifold depending on the particular problem, ν ∈ N
is a label of vortex line, ξ is an arbitrary longitudinal
parameter along the line. Dynamics of the line shape
R(ν, ξ, t) = (X(ν, ξ, t), Y (ν, ξ, t), Z(ν, ξ, t)) is determined
Ldt)/δR(ν, ξ, t) = 0, with
by the variational principle δ(

(3)

where the vector function D(R) must satisfy the only
relation

(∇R · D(R)) = 1.

(9)

Below we take D(R) = (0, Y, 0).

Now we apply this formalism to the 2D case, when
the three-component ﬁeld Ω does not depend on the z-
coordinate. The ﬁeld Ω(x, y, t) can be parameterized by
two scalar functions, Ψ(x, y, t) and Φ(x, y, t),

Ω = (∂yΨ, −∂xΨ, Φ).

(10)

Because of the freezing-in property, the Ψ-function is just
transported by the xy-component of the velocity ﬁeld,
that results in conservation of the integrals

IF =

Z

F (Ψ)d2r = const

(11)

with arbitrary function F (Ψ). If initially Ψ(x, y, 0) was
piecewise constant, then at any time we have a ﬂow with
cylindrical sheets of frozen-in generalized vorticity. Each
such cylinder is numbered by a number a = 1..N , has
a constant in time value ˜Ca of the jump of Ψ(x, y), and
consists of a family of closed (if Φ(x, y, 0) = 0) vortex
lines with identical shape but with diﬀerent shift along
z-axis, (Xa(ξ, t), Ya(ξ, t), Za(ξ, t) + η), where ξ is a longi-
tudinal parameter along a line, η is the shift. Obviously,
the number a together with the sift η serve in this case
as the 2D label ν.

For 2D ideal EMHD in the physical space we have from

Eq.(5) the double integral

2 Z Z

H{Ω} ∝

K0(|r1 − r2|)(Ω(r1) · Ω(r2))d2r1d2r2,

(12)
where K0(..) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second
kind. We do not write the exact coeﬃcient in front of
this expression since it only inﬂuences on a time scale
and thus is not very interesting for us.

As follows from equations written above, dynamics of
this set of contours in 2D ideal incompressible EMHD is
determined by the Lagrangian

where the new constants Ca are proportional to the cor-
responding jumps of Ψ function, X ′
a1 ≡ ∂ξ1 Xa(ξ1, t) and
so on.

For a given contour number, locally, a Cartesian coor-
dinate can be used as the longitudinal parameter, for
instance, the x-coordinate.
In this case the function
Ya(x, t) plays the role of the canonical coordinate, while
Za(x, t) plays the role of the canonical momentum. Thus,

2

we have a “natural” system with the Hamiltonian being
the sum of a quadratic on the generalized momentum
“kinetic energy” and a “potential energy” H(Ψ) depend-
ing on the shape of the contours in xy-plane, or, in other
words, on the Ψ function. In EMHD the “potential en-
ergy” describes the interaction between parallel electric
currents.

——————————————————————
At this point it is interesting to compare the 2D EMHD
with the usual Eulerian 2D hydrodynamics, which diﬀers from
(12) by the log-function instead of the K0-function. In that
case Ψ function is just the z-component of the velocity ﬁeld,
and the ”potential energy” H(Ψ) is an integral of motion for
Eulerian 2D ﬂows, as follows from the expression

H(Ψ)

|Ω(Ψ)

k2 =

(14)

and from Eq.(11) with F (Ψ) = Ψ2. Equations of motion, that
follow from the variational principle with the Lagrangian like
(13), but with “− log” instead of “K0”, are such that this term
does not have inﬂuence on the contour dynamics in xy-plane,
only it adds a linear function of the time to Z-coordinate of
a vortex line. This property corresponds to conservation of
the z-component of the velocity in 2D Eulerian ﬂows for each
moving element of the ﬂuid. Obviously, in 2D EMHD such
conservation does not take place.

III. LOCALIZED APPROXIMATIONS

A. The case of a single contour

For practical analytical calculations the system (13)
is not very convenient because of the non-locality. How-
ever, since the K0-function is exponentially small at large
values of its argument,
it is possible to introduce lo-
cal approximations for long-scale dynamics. Let us ﬁrst
have a single contour of a large size Λ ≫ 1. Then
for smooth conﬁgurations approximate local equations
of motion (with the time appropriately rescaled) can be
obtained by variating the expression

which naturally arises after we perform one integration
in the double integral in Eq.(13) with (almost) straight
shape of the adjacent piece (a few units of de) of the
contour. Although for us this system seems to be very
interesting and deserving much attention, now we con-
centrate on another case and consider unstable vortex
structure constituted by two close contours.

B. The case of two close contours

Let us now consider the case of two contours with equal
jumps Ψ0, symmetric with respect to the line y = 0,
and parameterize (locally) their shapes as (x, Y (x, t))
and (x, −Y (x, t)), as shown in Fig.1 in the small frame.
If a typical wave-length Λ along the x-direction is large
comparatively to both de = 1 and Y , then in the long-
scale localized approximation, with additional condition
Y ′2 ≪ 1, we have from Eq.(13)

Z n

L ∝≈

−const · Y ˙Z − [1 + Z ′2][1 − exp(−2Y )]

dx,

(16)
After an appropriate time rescaling we can put the
“const” in the above expression equal to 2 for conve-
nience. Then, after introducing new quantities ρ = 2Y
and µ = Z ′, as well as the function H(ρ, µ),

o

H(ρ, µ) = (1 + µ2)(1 − e−ρ),

(17)

it is possible to write down the corresponding equations
of motion in the following remarkable general form,

µ =

Hµ(ρ, µ) = 0,

+ Hρ(ρ, µ) = 0.

(18)

(19)

(20)

As known, any nonlinear system of such form can be lo-
cally reduced to a linear equation after taking as the new
independent variables ρ and µ (the so called hodograph
method; see, e.g., [11] for a particular case). Indeed, since
from (18) and (20) we see

it is useful to introduce an auxiliary function χ(ρ, µ) as

dZ = µdx − Hρdt,

χ = Z − xµ + tHρ

3

(21)

(22)

in order to obtain

dχ = −xdµ + tHρρdρ + tHρµdµ.

From here we easily derive

t =

χρ
Hρρ

,

x = Hρµ

− χµ.

χρ
Hρρ

After that we rewrite Eq.(19) as

∂(ρ, x)
∂(t, x)

− Hµρ

− Hµµ

∂(ρ, t)
∂(t, x)

∂(µ, t)
∂(t, x)

= 0

and multiply it by the Jacobian ∂(t, x)/∂(ρ, µ):

∂(ρ, x)
∂(ρ, µ)

− Hµρ

− Hµµ

∂(ρ, t)
∂(ρ, µ)

∂(µ, t)
∂(ρ, µ)

= 0.

Thus, now we have

xµ − Hµρtµ + Hµµtρ = 0.

Diﬀerentiating this equation over ρ with taking into ac-
count Eqs.(21-22) and subsequent simplifying give us the
linear partial diﬀerential equation for the function t(ρ, µ):

(Hµµt)ρρ − (Hρρt)µµ = 0.

(23)

It is also useful to write down here the general equation
for the function χ(ρ, µ):

(Hµµχρ/Hρρ)ρ − χµµ = 0.

(24)

Thus, the localized approximation (16) appears to be
integrable in the sense that it is reduced to solution of
a linear equation. However, the functions t(ρ, µ) and
x(ρ, µ) are multi-valued in general case. Therefore state-
ment of the Cauchy problem for the time evolution of
the system [originally the Cauchy problem was formu-
lated in (t, x)-representation in terms of initial functions
ρ0(x) and µ0(x) at t = t0] now becomes much more com-
plicated, since in (ρ, µ)-plane initial data are placed on
the parametrically given curve ρ = ρ0(x), µ = µ0(x)
which can have self-intersections. It should be noted here
that for χ(ρ, µ) initial data are determined directly by
Eqs.(21-22), while for t(ρ, µ) their determination needs
additional diﬀerentiation of Eq.(22) over ρ.

Besides this, the particular function H(ρ, µ) given by
Eq.(17) results in the elliptic partial diﬀerential equation
for the function t(ρ, µ),

2[(1 − e−ρ)t]ρρ + e−ρ[(1 + µ2)t]µµ = 0,

(25)

in contrast to the usual 1D gas-dynamic case described
in [11], where the corresponding equation is hyperbolic.
Generally speaking, the ellipticity makes the Cauchy
problem ill-posed in the mathematical sense, if the ini-
tial data are not very smooth. However, for suﬃciently

smooth initial data the problem remains correctly formu-
lated though still diﬃcult for complete solution.

Nevertheless, the linear equation seems to have an ad-
vantage, and we hope with its help to investigate more
easily the problem of classiﬁcation of possible singular-
ities in this system. In the future work we will discuss
how the quantity ρ can tend to zero at some point x.

where ǫ is the (small) width of the ﬁlaments. Taking the
x-coordinate as a longitudinal parameter ξ, we have the
system like (18-20), but with H(ρ, µ) = HCrow(ρ, µ),

1 + µ2 ln ρ.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARK

Investigation of the corresponding linear equation for the
function t(ρ, µ) is now in progress.

It should be also noted that an analogous approach is
useful in studying another unstable vortex structure, the
pair of anti-parallel vortex ﬁlaments in the usual hydro-
dynamics and in other hydrodynamic-type models [12]
(the corresponding instability in Eulerian hydrodynam-
ics is known as the Crow instability). For instance, if we
consider nonlinear development of the Crow instability
in long-scale limit, then the localized approximation for
symmetric (respectively to the plane y = 0) dynamics of
the vortex pair gives us the Hamiltonian

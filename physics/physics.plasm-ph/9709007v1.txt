Abstract

The impact of an equilibrium radial electric ﬁeld E on negative-energy per-
turbations (NEPs) in cylindrical equilibria of magnetically conﬁned plasmas is
investigated within the framework of Maxwell-drift kinetic theory. It turns out
that for wave vectors with a non-vanishing component parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld the conditions for the existence of NEPs in equilibria with E = 0 [G. N.
Throumoulopoulos and D. Pﬁrsch, Phys. Rev. E 53, 2767 (1996)] remain valid,
while the condition for the existence of perpendicular NEPs, which are found
to be the most important perturbations, is modiﬁed. For |eiφ| ≈ Ti, a scaling
which is satisﬁed in the edge region of magnetic conﬁnement systems (φ is the
electrostatic potential), the impact of E on perpendicular NEPs depends on the
value of Ti/Te, i.e., a) for Ti/Te < βc ≈ P/(B2/8π) (P is the total plasma pres-
sure) the electric ﬁeld does not have any eﬀect and b) for Ti/Te > βc, a case
which is of operational interest in magnetic conﬁnement systems, the existence
of perpendicular NEPs depends on eνE, where eν is the charge of the particle
species ν. In the latter case, for tokamaklike equilibria and H mode parameters
pertaining to the plasma edge two regimes of NEPs exist. In the one of them the
critical value 2/3 of ηi ≡ ∂ ln Ti/∂ ln Ni plays a role in the existence of ion NEPs,
as in equilibria with E = 0, while a critical value of ηe does not occur for the
existence of electron NEPs. However, E has a “stabilizing” eﬀect on both particle
species in that (a) the portion of particles associated with NEPs (active parti-
cles) is nearly independent of the plasma magnetic properties, i.e., it is nearly the
same in a diamagnetic plasma and in a paramagnetic plasma, while in equilibria
with E = 0 this portion is much larger in a paramagnetic plasma than in a dia-
magnetic plasma, and (b) the fraction of active particles can decrease from the
plasma interior to the edge, e.g., for the case of electron NEPs in an equilibrium
of a diamagnetic plasma, contrary to equilibria with E = 0. In particular, the
fraction of active electrons decreases with increasing ηe and for ηe > η0 ≈ 4/3 the
electric ﬁeld stabilizes the electrons, in that the fraction of active electrons be-
comes smaller than the one corresponding to equilibria with E = 0. In addition,
E has similar stabilizing eﬀects on electron NEPs in stellaratorlike equilibria with
pressure proﬁles identical to those of tokamaklike-equilibria, while it results in an
increase of the fraction of active ions in reversed-ﬁeld-pinchlike equilibria. The
present results indicate that the radial electric ﬁeld reduces the NEPs activity

in the edge region of tokamaks and stellarators, the reduction of electron NEPs
being more pronounced than that of ion NEPs.

I. INTRODUCTION

Negative-energy waves are potentially dangerous because they can lead to either
linear instability [1] or nonlinear, explosive instability [2] - [20]. Expressions for
the second variation of the free energy F (2) were derived by Pﬁrsch and Morrison
[7] for arbitrary perturbations of general equilibria within the framework of dissi-
pationless Maxwell-Vlasov and drift kinetic theories. It was also also found that
negative-energy perturbations exist in any Maxwell-Vlasov equilibrium whenever
the unperturbed distribution function f (0)
of any particle species ν deviates from
ν
monotonicity and/or isotropy in the vicinity of a single point, i. e., whenever the
condition

(k · v)

k ·

 

∂f (0)
ν
∂v !

> 0

(1)

holds (in the frame of reference of minimum equilibrium energy) for any particle
species ν for some position vector x and velocity v and for some local vector k.
The proof of this result was based on inﬁnitely strongly localized perturbations,
which correspond to |k| → ∞. This raises the question of the degree of local-
ization actually required for NEPs to exist in a certain equilibrium. Studying
a homogeneous Maxwell-Vlasov plasma [8], force-free equilibria with a sheared
magnetic ﬁled [9] and general one- and two-dimensional equilibria of magnetically
conﬁned plasmas [10]-[12], Correa-Restrepo and Pﬁrsch showed that NEPs exist
for any deviation of the equilibrium distribution function of any of the species
from monotonicity and/or isotropy, without having to impose any restricting
conditions on k.

NEPs which are not strongly localized can be investigated more conveniently
in the framework of Maxwell-drift kinetic theory which eliminates from the outset
all perturbations with perpendicular wavelengths smaller than the gyro-radius.
In the context of this theory, for a homogeneous magnetized plasma it was found
that NEPs exist for any wave vector k with a non-vanishing component parallel
to the magnetic ﬁeld (parallel and oblique modes) whenever the condition

vk

∂f (0)
gν
∂vk

> 0

(2)

is satisﬁed for the equilibrium guiding center distribution function f (0)
gν for some
particle species ν and parallel velocity vk in the frame of lowest equilibrium en-
ergy [7]. For the more interesting cases of inhomogeneous magnetically conﬁned

3

plasmas and equilibria depending on just one Cartesian coordinate x [17] and
cylindrical equilibria with vanishing electric ﬁelds [18, 19] in addition to parallel
and oblique modes for which condition (1) also applies, perpendicular NEPs are
possible. The latter are the most important perturbations because they can ex-
ist even if vk(∂f (0)
gν /∂vk) < 0, which is satisﬁed e.g. for Maxwellian distribution
functions for all vk. In plane geometry the pertinent condition is

dP (0)
dx

∂f (0)
gν
∂x

< 0,

where P (0) is the equilibrium plasma pressure. For tokamaklike equilibria with
singly peaked pressure proﬁles the existence of both ion and electron perpen-
dicular NEPs is associated with the critical value 2/3 of the quantity ην ≡
∂ ln Tν/∂ ln Nν (Tν is the temperature and Nν the density of particle species ν)
which usually governs the onset of the temperature gradient driven modes. For
cylindrical equilibria an additional regime of NEPs exists, related to the curvature
of the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. Also, for the case of cold-ion equilibria (Ti = 0) a
large portion of electrons is associated with NEPs (active particles).

The purpose of the present paper is two-fold: (a) to investigate the impact of
a radial electric ﬁeld on NEPs in cylindrical equilibria of magnetically conﬁned
plasmas and (b) to extend the study to equilibria with Ti 6= 0. The method of
investigation consists in evaluating the general expression F (2) for the second-
order perturbation energy within the framework of the linearized dissipationless
Maxwell-drift kinetic theory. This is the subject of Sec. II. The conditions for
the existence of NEPs are obtained in Sec.
III. It turns out that for parallel
and oblique perturbations condition (2) remains valid, while the condition for
perpendicular NEPs (which remain the most important perturbations) is mod-
iﬁed. To apply the condition for perpendicular NEPs in equilibria of magnetic
conﬁnement systems the equilibrium equations are needed, which are derived in
Sec.
IV. Shearless stellaratorlike equilibria are possible with local Maxwellian
distribution functions, while tokamaklike and reversed-ﬁeld-pinchlike equilibria
can be obtained from shifted Maxwellian distribution functions, which imply net
toroidal currents. For these kinds of distribution functions and H mode parame-
ters pertaining to the plasma edge the condition for the existence of perpendicular
NEPs is applied in Sec. V, and the eﬀect of E on the threshold value of ην is
examined. In Sec. VI the impact of E on the fraction of active particles is in-

4

vestigated for shearless stellaratorlike, tokamaklike and reversed-ﬁeld pinchlike
analytic equilibria. Our conclusions are summarized in Sec. VII.

II. EQUILIBRIUM AND SECOND-ORDER PERTURBATION
ENERGY

We start with a brief outline of the Maxwell-drift kinetic theory adapted to

the needs of the present study. More details can be found in Ref. [7].

The expression for the free energy F (2) upon arbitrary perturbations of general

equilibria is given by

F (2) =

ρ

where T (2)0
is the energy component of the second-order energy-momentum ten-
0
sor T (2)λ
. To derive the tensor T (2)λ
, Pﬁrsch and Morrison [7] used the following
ρ
modiﬁed Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. Let Hν(pi, qi, t) be the Hamiltonian for par-
ticles of species ν for the perturbed state in a phase space p1, ..., p4, q1, ..., q4 where
(q1, q2, q3) are generalized coordinates so that x = x(q1, q2, q3) and correspond-
ingly p = p(p1, p2, p3), where x is the position vector in normal space; p4, q4 is
an additional pair of canonical variables which is needed to describe guiding cen-
ν (Pi, Qi) be the equilibrium Hamiltonian in the phase space
ter motion. Let H (0)
P1, . . . , P4, Q1, ...Q4, and let Sν(Pi, qi, t) be a mixed-variable generating function
for a canonical transformation between pi, qi and Pi, Qi. The x, t dependence
of Hν is given via electromagnetic potentials φ(x, t) and A(x, t), the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds E(x, t) and B(x, t) and their derivatives. The quantities pi and
Qi are obtained from Sν as

pi =

The Hamiltonians Hν for the guiding center motion of a particle species ν,

Since Eqs. (12) do not contain ˙x and ˙q4, they are constraints between the mo-
menta and the coordinates. It therefore follows that Hamilton’s equations based
on the usual Hamiltonians corresponding to the above non-standard Lagrangians
are not the equations of motion. To overcome this diﬃculty, Dirac’s theory of
constrained dynamics [23] is applied, which yields the Dirac Hamiltonians

Hν = eνφ⋆

(13)

Particular solutions of the equations of motion following from the Hamiltonians
(13) are the constraints (12). The distribution functions fν(x, q4, p, p4, t) must
guarantee that these constraints are satisﬁed. As concerns this requirement, it
is important to note that p −
ν = 0 and p4 = 0 do not represent special
values of some constants of motion. Therefore, δ-functions of the constraints are
not constants of motion either. But fν must be proportional to such δ-functions
and, at the same time, also a constant of motion. Both conditions are uniquely

functions f (0)

Eq. (11) it follows that V (0)

The general expression for the second order perturbation energy [Eq.(3)] is
evaluated for these equilibria and for initial perturbations A(1) = 0 and ˙A(1) = 0.
It is also shown a posteriori that one can choose initial perturbations such that
the charge density ρ(1) vanishes without changing the particle contributions to
the energy. Thus, choosing perturbations of this kind, we can set from the outset

III. CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF
NEGATIVE-ENERGY PERTURBATIONS

The derivations in this section are very similar to those concerning equilibria

with E = 0 [17, 18, 19] so that details need not be given here.

The following conditions must be satisﬁed only locally in r, vk and µ, and

refer to the frame of reference of minimum energy.
Parallel perturbations (k⊥ = 0) NEPs exist when

rived by Pﬁrsch and Morrison for a homogeneous magnetized plasma [7], agrees
with those obtained by Correa-Restrepo and Pﬁrsch for several Maxwell-Vlasov
equilibria [8]-[12].

neous magnetized plasma and is not satisﬁed in thermal equilibrium, i.e., for
Maxwellian distribution functions.

e.g., P (r), Bz(r), the shift velocity diﬀerence Vi(r) − Ve(r) and Ti(r); then, Bθ(r)
can be obtained from Eq. (49), Ni(r) from Eq. (44), Ne(r) from Eq. (43) and
Te(r) from Eq.
(46). Analytic solutions, which are required for determining
the portion of active particles in equilibria of magnetic conﬁnement systems, are
constructed in Sec. VI.

V. PERPENDICULAR NEPs IN EQUILIBRIA OF MAGNETIC
CONFINEMENT SYSTEMS

In this section condition (33) for the existence of perpendicular NEPs is applied
to the equilibria deﬁned in . II and IV. For distribution functions of the form

Relation (56) is identical to the corresponding one in equilibria with E = 0 (Re-
lation (58) of Ref. [18]). For singly peaked density and the temperature proﬁles
and therefore ην > 0 for all ν, which is the most common case in equilibria of
magnetic conﬁnement systems, there are two regimes of NEPs depending on the
sign of Rν [Eq. (54)].

a) Rν < 0 Condition (56) implies that Uν < 0 must hold. The last two terms of
Uν [Eqs. (51)-(53)] become non-negative and vanish for Wνk → 0 and Wν⊥ → 0.
Consequently, Uν < 0 is satisﬁed whenever

(55)

(56)

(57)

The existence of perpendicular ion NEPs for any k⊥ is therefore related to the
threshold value of 2/3 of the quantity ην. As discussed in Ref. [17], this threshold
value is sub-critical in the sense that it is lower than the critical value ηc
ν ≈ 1 for
linear stability of temperature-gradient-driven modes.

b) Rν > 0
The condition for the existence of perpendicular NEPs becomes
Uν > 0. In this case the quantity ηνǫ1ν + ǫ2ν can be either positive or negative
and therefore no restriction is imposed on ην. It may be noted that for plane
equilibria it holds that Rν = P ′ < 0 and therefore the second regime of NEPs is
associated with the curvature of Bθ.

Relation (59) shows that the existence of perpendicular NEPs depends on the
sign of the particle species charge and the polarity of E. Henceforth and up to
the subsection “Reversed-ﬁeld-pinchlike equilibria” E 6= 0 will refer to this case
(Ti/Te > βc). In the edge region the radial electric ﬁeld is usually negative [26, 27].
It is noted here that the impact of the polarity of an externally induced radial
electric ﬁeld was investigated experimentally [28]. It was found that whereas the
energy conﬁnement in H-modes with E > 0 is at least as good as in those with
E < 0, the ratio of the ion conﬁnement time to the energy conﬁnement time is
about three times lower in the former case. We examine therefore in the following
NEPs for ions and electrons in equilibria with φ′ > 0.

In this case eνφ′ is positive and condition (59) is satisﬁed whenever Ui < 0.
Ions
Depending on the sign of Ri, there are two regimes of NEPs: a) If Ri < 0, Ui < 0
is satisﬁed whenever ηi > 2/3 and b) if Ri > 0 no restriction is imposed on ηi. It
is pointed out, however, that for E = 0 the condition associated with this second
regime is Ui > 0. As shown in Sec. VI, this diﬀerence aﬀects the fraction of active
ions.

Electrons Condition (59) is satisﬁed whenever Ue > 0. This yields

ηe <

(1 + ηeǫ1e + ǫ2e) .

(60)

For cold electrons (Wek → 0 and We⊥ → 0) condition (60) implies that NEPs exist
whenever ηe < 2/3. This indicates that E has a “stabilizing” eﬀect on electron
NEPs for large values of ηe. Owing to hot electrons however, condition (60) does
not yield an upper threshold value of ηe because electrons with non-vanishing
energy activate NEPs in the regime where ηe > 2/3. To determine the value of

17

For a magnetic conﬁnement system it holds that B2
θ /B2 ≈ P/(B2/8π) ≡ β with
max β ≈ 0.1 and therefore Ce ≈ De ≈ 1. Consequently, condition (61) implies
that nearly half of the electrons are active whenever it holds that 3/2−1/ηe ≈ 3/4.
This yields

η0
e ≈ 4/3.

Therefore, if E 6= 0 less than half of the electrons are active whenever ηe > η0
e
and this portion decreases as ηe takes larger values. On the other side, if E = 0
more than half of the electrons are active whenever ηe > η0
e with this portion
increasing as ηe takes larger values.

VI. ANALYTIC EQUILIBRIUM SOLUTIONS AND ACTIVE
PARTICLES

In this section the portion of active particles is determined on the basis of ana-
lytic shearless stellaratorlike, tokamaklike and reversed ﬁeld pinchlike equilibrium
solutions.

Shearless stellaratorlike (θ-pinch) equilibria

We consider the following proﬁles:

P = P (0)(1 − ρ2),

Ni = Ni(0)(1 − ρ2)ξ and Ti = Ti(0)(1 − ρ2)1−ξ, where ρ ≡ r/r0 and r0 correspond-
ν NνTν
ing to the plasma surface. Eqs. (49) with Bθ ≡ 0,
yield then

Ne = Ne(0)(1 − ρ2)ξ and Te = Te(0)(1 − ρ2)1−ξ. Here, Bz0 is the external constant
“toroidal” magnetic ﬁeld , β0 ≡ P (0)/(B2/8π) and the parameter ξ (0 ≤ ξ ≤ 1)
determines equilibria with diﬀerent values of ην, i.e.,

ην ≡

∂ ln Tν
∂ ln Nν

1 − ξ
ξ

.

(66)

Ion and electron NEPs are now examined separately.

Since the magnetic ﬁeld lines are straight, it holds that Ri = P ′ < 0 and
Ions
therefore ion NEPs exist only in equilibria with ηi > 2/3. The pertinent condition
Ui < 0 becomes

Relation (67) implies that:

1. The portion of active ions increases as ηi takes larger values. In particular,
for a ﬂat temperature and peaked density proﬁle there are no active ions;
for ηi = 1 one third of the thermal ions are active and for ηi = 2 this fraction
becomes 2/3; for a ﬂat density and a peaked temperature proﬁle (ηi → ∞)
all ions are active;

2. The portion of active ions increases from the center ρ = 0 to the edge region

ρ = 1.

For E = 0 the situation is similar to the foregoing one for ions. For
Electrons
E 6= 0 the condition for the existence of electron NEPs is Ue > 0 and therefore
the fractions of active electrons and ions are complementary to each other. Thus,
as also discussed in Sec. V, the electric ﬁeld stabilizes electron NEPs for ηe > 4/3,
e.g., for the equilibrium proﬁles (64)-(66) 1/3 of the thermal electrons are active
when ηe = 2, while the corresponding fraction for the equilibrium with E = 0 is
2/3. In addition, the fraction of active electrons decreases from the center to the
edge. This indicates that in the presence of E self-sustained turbulence associated
with electron NEPs should be reduced in the edge.

magnetic ﬁeld (α2 = 1) and of a paramagnetic plasma (α2 = 2) are illus-
trated, in Figs. 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The fractions of active ions are
nearly 1/3 for α → 0, 1/2 for α2 = 1 and 2/3 for α2 = 2. It is noted that for
α → 0 only the branch (70), associated with the threshold value ηi = 2/3
contributes while for α2 = 2 exclusively the branch (71) associated with the
curvature of the poloidal ﬁeld lines contributes.

FIG. 4. The portion of active ions for the equilibrium with E 6= 0, ηi = 1 and Bz =
constant, which is deduced from Eq. (72) [α4(ρ) ≡ 1 + (β/2)(1 − ρ2), b4(ρ) = 1 −
β(1−ρ2)]. The excess portion at the edge indicated by circles nearly compensates
for the excess portion at the center indicated by stars.

Relation (72) implies that:

1. The portion of active ions is nearly independent of the magnetic properties

of the plasma; it is approximately 1/3 for any value of α.

2. The portion of active ions can either be nearly independent of ρ, e.g., for
an equilibrium with constant Bz (α2 = 1) (Fig. 4) or decreases from the
center to the edge, e.g. for a paramagnetic plasma α2 = 2 (Fig. 5), while
this portion always increases for equilibria with E = 0.

Thus, E leads to a reduction of active ions.

FIG. 5. The portion of active ions for a strongly diamagnetic plasma with E 6= 0
and ηi = 1 deduced from Eq. (72) [α5(ρ) = 1 − 2β(1 − ρ2)]. The area ﬁlled by
stars represents the excess portion at the plasma center.

Electrons Recalling that the portion of active electrons is the same as that of
active ions when E = 0, and complementary when E 6= 0, respectively, the former
portion can be determined on the basis of the foregoing analysis for ions. Thus, in
addition to the stabilizing eﬀect of E for ηe > 4/3, the fraction of active electrons
(a) becomes nearly independent of the magnetic properties of the plasma and (b)
can decrease from the center to the edge, e.g., for the most common case of a
diamagnetic plasma.

Reversed-ﬁeld-pinchlike (force-free) equilibria

The solution of Eq. (49) with P ′ = 0 leads to Bz = Bz(0)J0(ρ) and Bθ =
Bz(0)J1(ρ), where J0 and J1 are Bessel functions. These proﬁles satisfactorily
describe the central region of the relaxed state of a reversed-ﬁeld pinch [29]. By
appropriately assigning Vi(r) − Ve(r), one can derive equilibria with a variety of
density and temperature proﬁles for which NEPs exist and a considerable fraction
of active ions and electrons are involved. From the equilibria considered it turns
out that E (a) does not aﬀect the electron NEPs and (b) enhances the fraction
of active ions.

As an example, we consider the most common equilibrium with constant den-

sity and temperature proﬁles:

For E = 0, with the aid of relation (55) condition (33) becomes

for any particle species ν. Therefore there are neither ion nor electron NEPs.

If E 6= 0, NEPs exist whenever the condition

following from relations (33) and (58), is satisﬁed. Owing to the presence of the
particle species charge in condition (75), for φ′ > 0 all ions are active, while the
active electrons are not aﬀected.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The impact of a radial electric ﬁeld on negative-energy perturbations (NEPs) in
cylindrical equilibria of magnetically conﬁned plasmas was investigated within
the framework of linearized dissipationless Maxwell-drift kinetic theory. The in-
vestigation consisted in evaluating the general expression for the second-order
perturbation energy derived by Pﬁrsch and Morrison for the equilibria under
consideration and for vanishing initial ﬁeld perturbations; then the conditions for
the existence of NEPs were obtained.

The electric ﬁeld E does not aﬀect the following condition for perturbations
with wave vectors parallel and oblique to the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld (kk 6= 0):
If the equilibrium guiding center distribution function f (0)
gν (r, vk, µ) of at least one
particle species ν satisﬁes the relation vk(∂f (0)
gν /∂vk) > 0 locally in r, vk and µ,
parallel and oblique NEPs exist with no essential restriction on k. The condition
for the existence of perpendicular NEPs (kk = 0), which holds regardless of the
sign of vk(∂f (0)
gν /∂vk), is modiﬁed. For |eiφ| ≈ Ti the eﬀect of E on perpendicular
NEPs depends on the value of Ti/Te, i.e., a) for Ti/Te < βc ≈ P/(B2/8π) the
electric ﬁeld has no eﬀect, and b) for Ti/Te > βc, a case which is of operational

25

interest in magnetic conﬁnement systems, the existence of perpendicular NEPs
depends on the sign of the particle species charge and the polarity of E [Relation
(33)]. For E < 0 it was found that:

1. For cylindrical tokamaklike equilibria described by local shifted Maxwellian
distribution functions and singly peaked pressure proﬁles there exist two
regimes of NEPs for both ions and electrons. One regime is associated
with the curvature of the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. In the other regime the
threshold value 2/3 of ηi ≡ ∂ ln Ti
is involved for ion NEPs, as in equilibria
∂ ln Ni
with E = 0, while a critical value of ηe does not occur for the existence of
electron NEPs. However, E has the following “stabilizing” eﬀects on both
particle species:

• The portion of particles associated with NEPs (active particles) is
nearly independent of the plasma magnetic properties, i.e. it is nearly
the same in a diamagnetic and in a paramagnetic plasma, while in
equilibria with E = 0 this portion is much larger in a paramagnetic
than in a diamagnetic plasma.

• The portion of active particles can be either constant or decreases
from the center to the edge, e.g., in the case of active electrons of
a diamagnetic plasma, while it always increases in the corresponding
equilibria with E = 0.

In particular, the fraction of active electrons decreases with increasing ηe
and for ηe > η0 ≈ 4/3 the electric ﬁeld stabilizes electron NEPs in the
sense that the fraction of active electrons becomes smaller than the one
corresponding to equilibria with E = 0.

2. In shearless stellaratorlike equilibria described by local Maxwellian distri-
bution functions and pressure proﬁles identical to those of tokamaklike-
equilibria, E leads to similar stabilizing eﬀects on electron NEPs; namely,
it reduces the fraction of active electrons (a) for ηe > η0 ≈ 4/3 and (b) from
the center to the edge.

In addition, irrespective of the value of Ti/Te, E does not aﬀect the electron NEPs
in reversed-ﬁeld pinchlike equilibria but “destabilizes” the ion NEPs in the sense

26

that it enhances the portion of active ions. For example, for an equilibrium with
constant density and temperature proﬁles all ions are active in the presence of E,
while there are not active ions when E = 0.

The present results indicate that a radial electric ﬁeld leads to a reduction of
the NEPs activity in the edge region of tokamaks and stellarators. For electrons,
which may mainly contribute to anomalous transport, this reduction is more
pronounced.

Finally, it may be noted that according to the results of our previous [18,
19] and in the present studies, the curvature of the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld is
unfavorable in the sense that it gives rise to an increase of NEPs activity. It can be
speculated that this is true for an arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. To check
this conjecture, it is interesting to investigate NEPs in a toroidal equilibrium, e.g.,
a tokamak, in which the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld is favorably curved on the inside
and unfavorably on the outside of the torus. Such a study might also reveal the
eﬀect of toroidicity on other aspects of NEPs, e.g., the threshold value ην = 2/3.

Abstract The PDE’s of classical electromagnetism can be generated
from two exterior diﬀerential systems that distinguish topologically the ﬁeld
intensities and potentials, F
dA = 0, from the ﬁeld excitations and the
−
charge current densities, J
dG = 0. The existence of potentials, A, leads
to the independent 3-forms of T-Torsion = AˆF and T-Spin = AˆG. The
exterior derivatives (divergences) of these 3-forms produce anomalies that de-
ﬁne the two classic Poincare invariants. The closed integrals of these forms,
when deformation invariants of frozen-in ﬁelds, deﬁne topological coherent
structures in the plasma. Solutions when T-Torsion (T-Spin) is zero deﬁne
transverse magnetic (electric) modes on topological grounds. When the di-
vergence of T-Torsion is not zero there exists a classical mechanism for charge
acceleration along the magnetic ﬁeld lines producing symplectic plasma cur-
rents; large temperature gradients along the B ﬁeld lines can act as a source
of stellar plasma jets in neutron stars.
In such circumstances, the Torsion
vector is uniquely deﬁned by conformal invariance of the Action potentials.
Plasma currents in the direction of the Torsion vector leave both AˆF and
AˆG conformally invariant, hence these ﬁelds are frozen-in even though the
processes are thermodynamically irreversible. The decaying coherent and
deformable topological structures associated with such frozen-in ﬁelds are
persistent and observable artifacts, similar to wakes, that can appear in any
plasma domain, such as that which surrounds stars.

1 Introduction

In the language of exterior diﬀerential systems [1] it becomes evident that
classical electromagnetism is equivalent to a set of topological constraints on
a variety of independent variables. Certain integral properties of an electro-
magnetic system are deformation invariants with respect to all continuous

1

evolutionary processes that can be described by a singly parameterized vec-
tor ﬁeld. These deformation invariants lead to the fundamental topological
conservation laws described in the physical literature as the conservation of
charge and the conservation of ﬂux. Recall the deﬁnitions:

A continuous process is deﬁned as a map from an initial state of
topology Tinitial into a ﬁnal state of perhaps diﬀerent topology
Tf inal such that the limit points of the initial state are permuted
among the limit points of the ﬁnal state. [2]

A deformation invariant is deﬁned as an integral over a closed
z ω such that the Lie derivative of the closed integral
manifold,
R
with respect to a singly parameterized vector ﬁeld, βV k, vanishes,
for any choice of parametrization, β.

The idea of a deformation invariant comes from the Cartan concept of a
tube of trajectories as applied to Hamiltonian mechanics. Consider the ﬂow
lines tangent to the trajectories generated by V k, and a closed integration
chain that connects points on a tube of diﬀerent trajectories. Under certain
conditions (when the virtual work vanishes) the integral of the exterior 1-
form of Action, A = pdq
H(p, q, t)dt evaluated along the closed integration
chain yields a value which is the same no matter how the integration chain
is deformed, as long as it resides on the same tube of trajectories. As
the points on the trajectories have relative displacements determined by a
factor β(p, q, t) then the closed chain connecting points can be deformed by
choosing a diﬀerent function β. Cartan used this idea for demonstrating
that the tube of trajectories is uniquely deﬁned on a contact manifold by a
Hamiltonian ﬂow that conserves energy. [3] He thereby deﬁned conservative
Hamiltonian processes in a topological manner by requiring that processes be
the subsets of singly parameterized vector ﬁelds that leave the closed integral
of the 1-form of Action a deformation invariant.

However, for physical systems that can be deﬁned by a 1-form of
Action, A, the derived 2-form F = dA is a deformation invariant with respect
to all continuous processes that can be deﬁned by a singly parameterized
vector ﬁeld. This concept is at the basis of the Helmholtz theorems in

hydrodynamics, and the conservation of ﬂux in classical electromagnetism.
Herein, this topological constraint will be called the postulate of potentials.
When written as the equation, F
dA = 0, the postulate of potentials is to be
recognized as an exterior diﬀerential system constraining the topology of the
independent variables. From Stokes theorem, the (2 dimensional) domain of
ﬁnite support for F can not in general be compact without boundary, unless
the Euler characteristic vanishes. There are two exceptional cases for two
dimensional domains, the (ﬂat or twisted) torus and the Klein-Bottle, but
these situations require the additional topological constraint that F ˆF = 0.
The ﬁelds in these exceptional cases must reside on these exceptional compact
surfaces, which form topological coherent structures in the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. For an electromagnetic action, the exceptional compact cases can only
B = 0. The resulting statement is that there do not exist compact
exist if E
domains of support without boundary when E
= 0, a statement that will
be of interest to thermodynamics of irreversible systems, and of plasma jets.
The deﬁnition of an electromagnetic system of charges and currents will
require a second topological constraint imposed upon the domain of indepen-
dent variables. This second postulate will be called the postulate of conserved
currents. The electromagnetic domain not only supports the 1-form A, but
also supports an N-1 form density, J,which is exact. The equivalent diﬀer-
dG = 0, requires that the (N-1 dimensional) domain of
ential system, J
support for J cannot be compact without boundary. However, the closed
integrals of J are deformation invariants for any continuous evolutionary
process that can be deﬁned in terms of a singly parameterized vector ﬁeld.
In section 2, the classical Maxwell system will be displayed in terms of
the vector formalism of Sommerfeld and Stratton. The key feature is to note
that the ﬁelds of intensities (E and B) are considered as separate and distinct
from the ﬁelds of excitation (D and H), a historical distinction (championed
by Sommerfeld) that is often masked in modern exposes of electromagnetic
theory.

can be used to construct the complete Pﬀaf sequence [4] of forms by the
processes of exterior diﬀerentiation and exterior multiplication. On a domain
of four independent variables, the complete Pfaﬀ sequence contains three 3-
forms: the classic 3-form of charge current density, J,and the (apparently
novel to many researchers) 3-forms of Topological Spin Current density,
AˆG,[5] and Topological Torsion-Helicity, AˆF [6]. To shorten notation,
the terms T-Torsion and T-Spin will be used.

As the charge current 3-form, J, is a deformation invariant by construc-
tion, it is of interest to determine topological reﬁnements or constraints for
which the 3-forms of T-Spin and T-Torsion will deﬁne physical topological
conservation laws in the form of deformation invariants. The additional
constraints are equivalent to the topological statement that the closure (ex-
terior derivative) of each of the three forms is empty (zero).
It will be
demonstrated in section 4 that these closure conditions deﬁne the two clas-
sic Poincare invariants (4-forms) as deformation invariants, and when each
of these invariants vanish the corresponding 3-form generates a topological
quantity (T-Spin or T-Torsion respectively) which is also a deformation in-
variant. The possible values of the topological quantities, as deRham period
integrals [7], form rational ratios.

The concepts of T-Spin Current and the T-Torsion vector have been uti-
lized hardly at all in applications of classical electromagnetic theory. Just as
the vanishing of the 3-form of charge current, J = 0, deﬁnes the topological
domain called the vacuum, the vanishing of the two other 3-forms will reﬁne
the fundamental topology of the Maxwell system. Such constraints permit
a deﬁnition of transversality to be made on topological (rather than geomet-

topologically transverse modes only (TTEM). Examples lead to the conjec-
ture that TTEM modes do not transmit power, a conjecture that has been
veriﬁed when the concept of geometric transversality (TEM) and topologi-
cal transversality (TTEM) coincide. A topologically transverse magnetic
(TTM) mode corresponds to the topological constraint that AˆF = 0. A
topologically transverse electric mode (TTE) corresponds to the topological
constraint that AˆG = 0. Examples, both novel and well-known, of vacuum
solutions to the electromagnetic system which satisfy (and which do not sat-
isfy) these topological constraints are given in the appendix. These ideas
should be of interest to those working in the ﬁeld of Fiber Optics. Recall
that classic solutions which are geometrically and topologically transverse
TTEM) do not transmit power [8]. However, in the appendix an
(TEM

≡

4

example vacuum wave solution is given which is geometrically transverse (the
ﬁelds are orthogonal to the ﬁeld momentum and the wave vector), and yet
the geometrically transverse wave transmits power at a constant rate:
the
example wave is not topologically transverse as AˆF

= 0.

In section 4, an additional topological constraint will be used to deﬁne
the plasma process as a restriction on all processes which can be described
in terms of a singly parameterized vector ﬁeld. The plasma process (which
is to be distinguished from a Hamiltonian process) will be restricted to those
vector ﬁelds which leave the closed integrals of G a deformation invariant.
(Compare to the Cartan deﬁnition that a Hamiltonian process is a restriction
on arbitrary processes such that the closed integrals of A are deformation
invariants with respect to Hamiltonian processes). A plasma process need
not conserve energy. A perfect plasma process is a plasma process which
is also a Hamiltonian process. Again, the three forms, J, AˆG and AˆF
are of particular interested for their tangent manifolds deﬁne ”lines” in the
4-dimensional variety of space and time. Relative to plasma processes, the
topological evolution associated with such lines, and their entanglements, is
of utility in understanding solar corona and plasma instability. [9]

2.2 The conservation of charge current

In every case, the charge current density for the Maxwell system satisﬁes
the conservation law,

div J + ∂ρ/∂t = 0.

The charge-current densities are subsumed to be zero [J, ρ] = 0 for the
vacuum state. For the Lorentz vacuum state, the ﬁeld excitations, D and
H, are linearly connected to the ﬁeld intensities, E and B, by means of the
Lorentz (homogeneous and isotropic) constitutive relations:

D = εE , B = µH.

The two vacuum constraints imply that the solutions to the homogeneous
Maxwell equations also satisfy the vector wave equation, typically of the form

constraints can be more complex [11], and for the plasma state where the
charge-current densities are not zero.

2.3 The existence of potentials

constrained by the statement that the ﬁeld intensities are deducible from a
system of twice diﬀerentiable potentials, [A, φ]:

The formulation of Maxwell theory in section 2 is relative to a choice of
independent variables
using classical vector analysis developed in
euclidean 3-space. The topological features of the formalism are not imme-
diately evident. However, electromagnetism has a formulation in terms of
Cartan’s exterior diﬀerential forms [12]. Exterior diﬀerential forms do not
depend upon a choice of coordinates, do not depend upon the a choice of
metric, and are independent of the constraints imposed by gauge groups and
connections.
In such a formulation the equations of an electromagnetic
system become recognized as consequences of topological constraints on a
domain of independent variables.

The use of diﬀerential forms should not be viewed as just another formal-
ism of fancy. The technique goes beyond the methods of tensor calculus,
and admits the study of topological evolution. Recall that if an exterior dif-
,
ferential system is valid on a ﬁnal variety of independent variables
}
then it is also true on any initial variety of independent variables that can
be mapped onto
. The map need only be diﬀerentiable, such that
the Jacobian matrix elements are well deﬁned functions. The Jacobian
matrix does not have to have an inverse, so that the exterior diﬀerential
system is not restricted to the equivalence class of diﬀeomorphisms. The
ﬁeld intensities on the initial variety are functionally well deﬁned by the pull-
back mechanism, which involves algebraic composition with components of
the Jacobian matrix transpose, and the process of functional substitution.
This independence from a choice of independent variables (or coordinates)
for Maxwell’s equations was ﬁrst reported by Van Dantzig [13].
It follows
that the Maxwell diﬀerential system is well deﬁned in a covariant manner
for both Galilean transformations as well as Lorentz transformations, or any
other diﬀeomorphism.
(The singular solution sets to the equations do not
enjoy this universal property). In addition, it should be noted that the ideas
of the exterior diﬀerential system imply that the closure equations of the
Maxwell-Faraday type form a nested set, with exactly the same format, in-
dependent of the choice of the number of independent variables. In addition,
every physical system (such as ﬂuid) that supports a 1-form of Action, has
its version of the Maxwell-Faraday induction equations.

where A is a 1-form of Action, with twice diﬀerentiable coeﬃcients (poten-

terior diﬀerential system is a topological constraint that in eﬀect deﬁnes

classical electromagnetism from Yang-Mills ﬁeld theories (where the domain

over, the fact that F is subsumed to be exact and C1 diﬀerentiable excludes
the concept of magnetic monopoles from classical electromagnetic theory on
topological grounds. The closed integral of the 2-form F over any closed 2-
manifold is a deformation (topological) invariant of any evolutionary process

where G is an N-2 form density of ﬁeld excitations (D and H , related to

system are precisely the Maxwell-Ampere equations. This second postulate,
on a four dimensional domain of independent variables, assumes the existence
of a N-2 form density given by the expression,

G = G34(x, y, z, t)dxˆdy... + G12(x, y, z, t)dzˆdt... = Dzdxˆdy...Hzdzˆdt...

The fact that J is exact leads to the charge conservation law, dJ = ddG =

(21)

The exterior diﬀerential system is a topological constraint for by Stokes
theorem the support for G can be compact without boundary only if the
domain is without charge-currents. The closure of the exterior diﬀerential
system, dJ = 0, generates the charge-current conservation law. The integral
of J over a closed 3 dimensional domain is a relative integral invariant (a
deformation invariant) of any process that can be described in terms of a
singly parametrized vector ﬁeld. The formal statement is given by Cartan’s
magic formula [14], which describes continuous topological evolution in terms
of the action of the Lie derivative, with respect to a vector ﬁeld, acting on
the exterior diﬀerential 3-form, J :

3.3 The T-Torsion and T-Spin 3-forms

As mentioned above, the method of exterior diﬀerential forms goes be-
yond the domain of classical tensor analysis, for it admits of maps from ini-
tial to ﬁnal state that are without inverse.
(Tensor analysis and coordinate
transformations require that the Jacobian map from initial to ﬁnal state has
an inverse - the method of exterior diﬀerential forms does not.) Hence the
theory of electromagnetism expressed in the language of exterior diﬀerential
forms admits of topological evolution, at least with respect to continuous pro-
cesses without Jacobian inverse. With respect to such non-invertible maps,

10

both tensor ﬁelds and diﬀerential forms are not functionally well deﬁned in
a predictive sense [15]. Given the functional forms of a tensor ﬁeld on an
initial state, it is impossible to predict uniquely the functional form of the
tensor ﬁeld on the ﬁnal state unless the map between initial and ﬁnal state is
invertible. However diﬀerential forms are functionally well deﬁned in a retro-
dictive sense, by means of the pullback. Covariant anti-symmetric tensor
ﬁelds pull back retrodictively with respect to the transpose of the Jacobian
matrix (of functions) and functional substitution, and contravariant tensor
densities pullback retrodictively with respect to the adjoint of the Jacobian
matrix, and functional substitution. The transpose and the adjoint of the
Jacobian exist, even if the Jacobian inverse does not.

The exterior diﬀerential forms that make up the electromagnetic system
consist of the primitive 1-form, A, and the primitive N-2 form density, G,their
exterior derivatives, and their algebraic intersections deﬁned by all possible
exterior products. The complete Maxwell system of exterior diﬀerential forms
(the Pfaﬀ sequence for the Maxwell system) is given by the set:

A, F = dA, G, J = dG, AˆF, AˆG, AˆJ, F ˆF, GˆG

.

(23)

}

{

These forms and their unions may be used to form a topological base on
the domain of independent variables.
The Cartan topology constructed
on this system of forms has the useful feature that the exterior derivative
may be interpreted as a limit point, or closure, operator in the sense of
Kuratowski [16]. The exterior diﬀerential systems that deﬁne the Maxwell-
Ampere and the Maxwell-Faraday equations above are essentially topological
constraints of closure. Note that the complete Maxwell system of diﬀerential
forms (which assumes the existence of A) also generates two other exterior
diﬀerential systems.

topologically transverse magnetic (TTM) waves:

in the appendix, a vacuum wave solution is given which satisﬁes the geomet-
ric concept of transversality ( it is both a TM and a TE solution) but the
mode radiates for it is not both a TTM and a TTE solution. The conjecture
obtained from examples is that a TTEM solution does not radiate.

Note that if the 2-form F was not exact, such topological concepts of
transversality would be without meaning, for the 3-forms of T-Spin and T-
Torsion depend upon the existence of the 1-form of Action. The torsion

logical objects are related to the conformal invariants of a Lorentz system as
discovered by Poincare and Bateman.

, the exterior derivative corresponds to the 4-divergence of

the 4-component T-Spin and T-Torsion vectors, S4 and T4. The functions
so created deﬁne the Poincare conformal invariants of the Maxwell system:

closed 3-dimensional integral becomes a topological quantity in the sense of
a deRham period integral. For example, when the ﬁrst Poincare invariant
vanishes, the closed integral of the 3-form ofT-Spin becomes a deformation
invariant with quantized values:

quantized values:

It is important to realize that these topological conservation laws are valid in
a plasma as well as in the vacuum, subject to the conditions of zero values for
the Poincare invariants. On the other hand, topological transitions require
that the Poincare invariants are not zero.

4 Deformation Invariants and the Plasma State.

4.1 Special evolutionary processes. The plasma pro-

cess

As described in a previous section, the fundamental equation of topological
evolution is given by Cartan’s magic formula, which acts as a propagator on
the forms that make up the exterior diﬀerential system. As stated in the
ﬁrst paragraph, an evolutionary process is deﬁned herein as a map that can
be described by a singly parameterized vector ﬁeld.
If the Action of the
Lie derivative on the complete system of Maxwell exterior diﬀerential forms
vanishes for a particular choice of process, then that process leaves the entire
Maxwell system absolutely invariant. As a topology can be constructed in
terms of an exterior diﬀerential system, and if a special process leaves that
system of forms invariant, then the topology induced by the system of forms
is invariant; the process must be a homeomorphism.

However, for a given Maxwell system, it is more likely that only some of
the exterior diﬀerential forms that make up the Maxwell system are invari-
ant relative to an arbitrary process; others are not. Of particular interest
are those forms which are relative integral invariants of continuous deforma-
tions. The closed integral of the form is not only invariant with respect
to a process represented by particular vector ﬁeld, but also with respect to
longitudinal deformations of that process obtained by multiplying the par-
ticular vector ﬁeld by an arbitrary function. For vector ﬁelds which are
singly parameterized, this concept of longitudinal deformation is equivalent
to a reparameterization of the vector ﬁeld.

The development that follows is guided by Cartan’s pioneering work,
in which he examined those specialized processes for mechanical systems that
leave the 1-form of Action, A, a deformation invariant. Cartan proved that
such processes always have a Hamiltonian representation. An electromag-
netic system has not only the primitive 1-form, A, but also the N-2 form, G,
which can undergo evolutionary processes. For electromagnetic systems, a
particular interesting choice of specialized processes are those that leave the
N-2 form, G, of ﬁeld excitations a deformation (relative) integral invariant.
The equations that must be satisﬁed are of the form

It follows that deformation invariance of the N-2 form G requires that the

15

admissable evolutionary processes be restricted to those that satisfy the def-
initions of the classical plasma:

J = ρV.

(50)

(This constraint is used to deﬁne the ”Plasma state”in this article). As
the closed integrals of G are by Gauss law, the counters of net charge within
the closed domain, the classical plasma equation is to be recognized as the
statement that in the closed domain the net number of charges is a deforma-
tion invariant. That is, charges can be produced only in equal and opposite
pairs by a ”plasma process”. A plasma process does not involve net charge
production.

This invariance principle is to be compared to the Helmholtz theorem
which checks on the validity of the deformation integral invariance of the
2-form F.

(51)

LβV(

F ) =

i(βV )dF = 0

The closed integral of Helmholtz is an intrinsic topological (deformation) in-
variant of an electromagnetic system, for the 2-form F is exact by construc-
tion (the postulate of potentials). The Helmholtz integral is a deformation
invariant for all evolutionary processes that can be described by a singly pa-
rameterized vector ﬁeld.
(This statement is not true for Yang Mills ﬁelds).
Hence in a plasma, for which the evolutionary processes are constrained such
that J = ρV, both the closed integrals of F and G are deformation invari-
ants.
In the sense, the plasma is a topological reﬁnement of the complete
Maxwell system.

In the subsections that follow, various topological categories of plasma
processes will be examined. The ideal and semi-ideal plasma processes will
obey the plasma master equation, and the non-ideal plasma processes will
not. The electromagnetic ﬂux is a local (absolute) invariant of all semi-
ideal plasma processes. This statement is similar to the classiﬁcation of
hydrodynamic ﬂows.
Ideal and semi-ideal hydrodynamic ﬂows satisfy the
Helmholtz theorem, and the local conservation of vorticity.

4.2 The ideal plasma process = a Hamiltonian process.

Next consider the evolutionary properties of the 1-form of Action in the
plasma state by evaluating the possible deformation invariance of the 1-form
of Action, A, with respect to motions that preserve the plasma state:

then the closed integral of the Action 1-form is also a deformation topological
invariant of the Plasma process. Such a set of constraints,

W = i(ρV )dA = 0,

topologically deﬁnes the ”ideal” plasma state as a plasma process for which
the 1-form of virtual Work vanishes. By Cartan’s theorem, the 1-form of
Action then has a unique Hamiltonian representation and the ideal plasma
process is uniquely deﬁned as a Hamiltonian process ( the Pfaﬀ dimension of
the 1-form, A must processes be 3 or less for uniqueness). The ideal plasma
is thereby a restriction of arbitrary processes to that unique process that
leaves invariant both the closed integrals of ﬂux and the closed integrals of
charge.
Ideal plasmas are electromagnetic systems for which the admissable
processes are the intersection of a plasma process and a unique Hamiltonian
process. The ideal plasma can not exist on a domain of a 4 dimensional
variety where the second Poincare invariant is not zero.

4.3 The Bernoulli-Casimir plasma process is a semi-

ideal plasma process.

The topological constraint that the 1-form of virtual work vanishes is suﬃ-
cient but not necessary for a plasma process to preserve the closed integrals

17

of the Action 1-form. Evolutionary invariance of the closed integral of Ac-
tion does not require that the plasma process be unique. The 1-form of
virtual Work, W, need not be zero, but only closed: dW
0. By analogy
to hydrodynamics, if the virtual Work 1-form is exact,

⇒

W = dΘ

(56)

then the Lorentz force is represented by a spatial gradient, ρE+J
Θ,
E = ∂Θ/∂t. The function Θ(x, y, z, t) is a Bernoulli-
and the Power
Casimir function, and acts as the generator of a symplectic Hamiltonian ﬂow.
The (non-unique) Bernoulli-Casimir function is an evolutionary invariant for
each process path, but is not necessarily a constant over the domain:

function, but is more closely related to the thermodynamic concept of en-
thalpy. The Bernoulli-Casimir function can be used to generate a ”Hamil-
tonian process”, but the process is not uniquely deﬁned.

For such symplectic plasma processes, the gradient of the Bernoulli-
Casimir function is transverse to the B ﬁeld only when the second Poincare
invariant vanishes.

magnetic ﬁeld.

It is suggested that the large temperature gradient that exists in a
plasma envelope about a rotating star (with a B ﬁeld like a neutron star) can
induce a current ﬂow and an E acceleration ﬁeld along the polar magnetic
ﬁeld lines. Like in a Bernoulli process in a ﬂuid, the mechanical energy is not
conserved, but the enthalpy (the Bernoulli-Casimir) is a invariant along any
trajectory, and that invariant can be diﬀerent from trajectory to neighboring
trajectory.

4.4 The Stokes plasma process is a semi-ideal process

that obeys the Master equation.

The constraint that the virtual work 1-form, W , generated by a plasma
process, W = i(ρV )dA, be closed, does not require that it be exact. The
constraint of closure yields two vector conditions:

For an arbitrary vector ﬁeld Z whose tangents deﬁne a line in space time,

the N-1 form

W = i(γZ)dxˆdyˆdzˆdt

(65)

can be tested for evolutionary invariance relative to any other vector V. Sup-
pose the eﬀect of the evolutionary process is conformal:

L(V )W = i(V )d W + d(i(V )W ) = Γ(x, y, z, t)W

(66)

This statement implies that the points that make up the tangent line of the
vector ﬁeld W remain on the tangent line. The points may be permuted
but they do not leave the line.
Such is the concept of a frozen in ﬁeld.
The points that make up a line evolve into points of the same line. The
evolution need not be uniformly continuous, especially where the points are
folded. Yet even in such cases the points of a line are still points of the line,
If for a given V the evolution of the lines

of W is conformal, then there exists a parametrization of V such that the
evolution is uniform and invariant. A parametrization function β(x, y, z, t)

For the electromagnetic system there are three N-1 forms, which may or
may not be frozen into the evolutionary process. Consider the 3-form of

So the plasma evolutionary process evolutionary, with
J = ρV, is an example of a process that ”freezes-in” the lines of current.
However, there are many other evolutionary processes for which the J lines
are frozen in.

(68)

(69)

20

The formulas created by 4.16 are valid on any set of independent variables,
but expressions on 4 dimensions of space time for ”frozen-in” lines are not
quite the same as those that appear in the engineering literature based on
euclidean 3-space [21]. Either the time-like component of the 4-vector W
must vanish, or the process V must be explicitly time-independent for the
general formulas to be in precise agreement with the engineering expressions.
[22]

It is important to note that in space time the ”frozen-in” lines must
be related to 3-forms, and not to the two form components E and B. These
latter objects can produce ”frozen-in” lines only on the exceptional 2-surfaces,
B =0). The 3-form
the torus and the Klein bottle, (and then only when E
of T-Torsion has spatial components that are dominated by the B ﬁeld (in
the limit E

appearance of ”frozen-in” lines of B. The 3-form of T-Spin has lines that
can be dominated by A
H. However the explicit formulas for the 3-forms
of T-Torsion and T-Spin are not dependent upon a choice of constitutive
relations that act as geometrical constraints on the 2-forms of F and G. See
below.

parallel to the plasma current or they can be orthogonal to the plasma cur-

As the electromagnetic current is exact, any three dimensional domain of
support for a ﬁnite plasma current cannot be compact without a boundary.
If the lines of plasma current do not stop or start on boundary points (cur-
rent loops), then the T-Spin lines which terminate on boundary points can

The concept of the T-Spin vector depends on the existence of G, but not
on the concept of J = dG. That is, the T-Spin vector can be associated
with separated domains of charges, which can be compact domains with-
out boundary that are compliments of the domain of ﬁnite charge current
densities, which are domains that can not be compact without boundary.

5 Thermodynamics

5.1 Topological Thermodynamics and Irreversibility

The basic tool for studying topological evolution is Cartan’s magic formula, in
which it is presumed that a physical (hydrodynamic) system can be described
adequately by a 1-form of Action, A, and that a physical process can be
represented by a contravariant vector ﬁeld, V, which can be used to represent
a dynamical system or a ﬂow:

will terminate at an integer number of terms

From the point of view of diﬀerential topology, the key idea is that the
Pfaﬀ dimension, or class [23], of the 1-form of Action speciﬁes topological
properties of the system. Given the Action 1-form, A, the Pfaﬀ sequence,
the
{
number of dimensions of the domain of deﬁnition. On a 2n+2=4 dimensional
domain, the top Pfaﬃan, dAˆdA, will deﬁne a volume element with a density
function whose singular zero set (if it exists) reduces the symplectic domain
to a contact manifold of dimension 2n+1=3. This (defect) contact manifold
supports a unique extremal ﬁeld that leaves the Action integral ”stationary”,
and leads to the Hamiltonian conservative representation for the Euler ﬂow
in hydrodynamics. The irreversible regime will be on an irreducible sym-

(or coherent structures) appear as singularities of lesser Pfaﬀ (topological)
dimension, dAˆdA = 0.

Classical hydrodynamic processes can be represented by certain nested
categories of vector ﬁelds, V. Recall that in order to be Extremal, the pro-
cess, V, must satisfy the equation

i(V)dA = 0;

di(V)dA = 0.

(81)

Extremal processes cannot exist on the non-singular symplectic domain,
because a non-degenerate anti-symmetric matrix (the coeﬃcients of the 2-
form dA) does not have null eigenvectors on space of even dimensions . Al-
though unique extremal stationary states do not exist on the domain of Pﬀaf
dimension 4, there can exist evolutionary invariant Bernoulli-Casimir func-
tions, Θ, that generate non-extremal, ”stationary”states. Such Bernoulli
processes can correspond to energy dissipative symplectic processes, but
they, as well as all symplectic processes, are reversible in the thermodynamic
sense described below. The mechanical energy need not be constant, but the
Bernoulli-Casimir function(s), Θ,are evolutionary invariant(s), and may be
used to describe non-unique stationary state(s).

The equations, above, that deﬁne several familiar categories of processes,
are in eﬀect constraints on the topological evolution of any physical system
represented by an Action 1-form, A. The Pfaﬀ dimension of the 1-form of
virtual work, W = i(V)dA is 1 or less for the three categories. The extremal
constraint of equation 79 can be used to generate the Euler equations of hy-
drodynamics for a incompressible ﬂuid. The Bernoulli-Casimir constraint of

24

equation 80 can be used to generate the equations for a barotropic compress-
ible ﬂuid. The Helmholtz constraint of equation 81 can be used to generate
the equations for a Stokes ﬂow. All such processes are thermodynamically
reversible. None of these constraints above will generate the Navier-Stokes
equations, which require that the topological dimension of the 1-form of vir-
tual work must be greater than 2.

A crucial idea is the recognition that irreversible processes must on do-
= 0, with its
mains of Pfaﬀ dimension which support T-Torsion, AˆdA
attendant properties of non-uniqueness, envelopes, regressions, and projec-
tivized tangent bundles. Such domains are of Pfaﬀ dimension 3 or greater.
Moreover, as described below, it would appear that thermodynamic irre-
versibility must support a non-zero Topological Parity 4-form, dAˆdA
= 0.
Such domains are of Pfaﬀ dimension 4 or greater.

Although there does not exist a unique gauge independent stationary
state on the symplectic manifold of Pfaﬀ dimension 4, remarkably there does
exist a unique vector ﬁeld on the symplectic domain, with components that
are generated by the 3-form AˆdA. This unique (to within a factor) vector
ﬁeld is deﬁned as the T-Torsion vector, T4, and satisﬁes (on the 2n+2=4
dimensional manifold) the equation,

i(T4)dxˆdyˆdzˆdt = AˆdA

(82)

This (four component) vector ﬁeld, T4, has a non-zero divergence almost ev-
erywhere, for if the divergence is zero, then the 4-form dAˆdA vanishes, and
the domain is no longer a symplectic manifold! The T-Torsion vector, T4,
can be used to generate a dynamical system that will decay to the station-
ary states (div4(T4)
0) starting from arbitrary initial conditions. These
It is remarkable that
processes are irreversible in the thermodynamic sense.
this unique evolutionary vector ﬁeld, T4, is completely determined (to within
a factor) by the physical system itself; e.g., the components of the 1-form,
A, determine the components of the T-Torsion vector.

⇒

To understand what is meant by thermodynamic irreversibility, realize
that Cartan’s magic formula of topological evolution is equivalent to the ﬁrst
law of thermodynamics.

L(v)A = i(V)dA + d(i(V)A) = W + dU = Q.

(83)

25

A is the ”Action” 1-form that describes the hydrodynamic system. V is the
vector ﬁeld that deﬁnes the evolutionary process. W is the 1-form of (virtual)
work. Q is the 1-form of heat. From classical thermodynamics, a process
is irreversible when the heat 1-form Q does not admit an integrating factor.
From the Frobenius theorem, the lack of an integrating factor implies that
= 0. Hence a simple test may be made for any process, V, relative to
QˆdQ
a physical system described by an Action 1-form, A:

If L(v)AˆL(v)dA

= 0 then the process is irreversible.

(84)

This topological deﬁnition implies that the three categories (above) of

symplectic, Hamiltonian or extremal processes,
dQ = 0). However, for evolution in the direction of the T-Torsion vector, T4,
direct computation demonstrates that the fundamental equations lead to a
conformal evolutionary process, a process which is thermodynamically irre-
versible:

S, are reversible (as L(S)dA =

L(T4)A = σA

and

i(T4)A = 0,

such that

L(T4)AˆL(T4)dA = QˆdQ = σ2AˆdA

= 0.

It is remarkable for the irreversible case that the Lie derivative with respect
to T acting on A is comparable to the covariant derivative. However the
Lie derivative with respect to T acting on dA is not equivalent to a covariant
derivative.

5.2 Applications to Electromagnetism and Plasmas

plasma currents) that are proportional to the T-Torsion vector are thermody-

of evolution in the direction of the T-Torsion vector lead to extraordinary
properties when the plasma current is in the direction of the T-Torsion vec-
tor. From the thermodynamic arguments presented above, based on the

For plasma motions in the direction of the (possibly dissipative) torsion vec-

Torsion vector are ”frozen in”. Such ”frozen in”objects can be used to give a
topological deﬁnition of deformable coherent structures in a plasma. More-

6 Electromagnetic Waves in the Vacuum with

T-Spin and T-Torsion

As the T-Spin 4-vector and the T-Torsion 4-vector formalism may be unfamil-
iar to many readers, it is useful to compare four classes of unusual vacuum
wave solutions with the usual waveguide solutions. The ”unusual waves”
have their vector potential, A, orthogonal to the wave vector, k, describing
the direction of the wave front. In each unusual example, the current density
is in the direction of the vector potential and therefore also orthogonal to the
wave vector. The usual wave solutions have their vector potential parallel
to the wave vector. The four unusual cases belong to equivalence classes
deﬁned by the constraints

(AˆF = 0, AˆG
= 0)
= 0, AˆG = 0)
(AˆF
(AˆF = 0, AˆG = 0)
= 0).
(AˆF

= 0, AˆG

In each case, each component of the potentials satisﬁes the wave equation
subject to the phase velocity relation, (ω/k)2
1/(ξµ) = 0. The current
density, J, is proportional to the vector potential, A, (in a fashion reminiscent
to the London conjecture) multiplied by the same phase velocity relation.
The examples do not generate any charge current distributions when the
phase velocity equation is satisﬁed (the phase velocity equals the speed of
light as determined by the constitutive equations).

This class of potentials generates a set of complex ﬁeld intensities and
excitations, and a current density proportional to the vector potential. The
ﬁelds are said to be complex linearly polarized because the complex B ﬁeld
is a complex scalar multiple of the complex E ﬁeld.
If the dispersion rela-
tion (k2
εµω2) = 0 is satisﬁed, then the solutions are acceptable vacuum
solutions, with a vanishing charge current density. Note that both the T-
Torsion vector and the T-Spin vector vanish identically. The complex square
of both the electric and the magnetic ﬁeld vectors vanish. Both Poincare
invariants vanish independent from the dispersion constraint. Although the
ﬁelds are propagating, there is no momentum ﬂux and the Poynting vector is
zero. The E and B ﬁelds are (complex) collinear. This example is perhaps
the simplest member of the class of Bateman-Whittaker complex solutions
described in Example 11, below.

Note that in this solution, the fourth component of the Action is scaled
by the ”group velocity”, vg, not the ”speed of light”, as determined by the
constitutive properties: c =
1/ξµ. This class of potentials requires that the
function φ(x, y) be a solution of the two dimensional Helmholtz equation,
2φ + λ2φ = 0 . The phase velocity, vp = ω/k, diﬀers from the group veloc-

ity, vg. Again, two constraint conditions (dispersion relations) are required
for the solution to be a vacuum solution without charge currents. One of
the constraint conditions demands that the product of the group and the
phase velocity, vp = ω/k, to be equal to the square of the speed of light as
determined from the constitutive properties:

Example 9. Superposition of the two compli-

mentary examples of type 1 and type 2.

When the potentials of examples type 1 and type 2 above are combined by ad-
dition or subtraction, the resulting wave is topologically transverse magnetic,
but not topological transverse electric. Not only does the second Poincare
invariant vanish under superposition, but so also does the T-Torsion 4 vec-
tor. Conversely, the examples above show that there can exist topologically
transverse magnetic waves which can be decomposed into two non-transverse
waves. A notable feature of the superposed solutions is that the T-Spin 4
vector does not vanish, hence the example superposition is a wave that is not
topologically transverse electric. However, for the examples above and their
superposition, the ﬁrst Poincare invariant vanishes, which implies that the
T-Spin remains a conserved topological quantity for the superposition. The
T-Spin current density for the combined examples is given by the formula:

density has a sense of ”circulation” about the z axis, and is proportional to

The formula demonstrates that the Lorentz force on the plasma, for the
given system of circulating currents, is directed radially away (centrifugally)
from the rotational axis, and yet is such that the plasma is attracted to
the z = 0, xy plane. The Lorentz force is divergent in the radial plane
and convergent in the direction of the z axis, towards the z=0 plane. This
electromagnetic ﬁeld, therefor, would have the tendency to form an accretion
disk of the plasma in the presence of a central gravitational ﬁeld.

Although the 3-form of T-Torsion vanishes identically, the 3-form of
T-Spin is not zero. The spatial components of the T-Spin are opposite to the
direction ﬁeld of the Lorentz force (in the sense of a radiation reaction).

6.12 Example 11. Self dual solutions

It is possible to construct a two-form G (without using the Lorentz vacuum

the dual relations:

The functions α and β used in the dual construction are not required to be
solutions of the Bateman condition. However, the resulting ”self-dual” ﬁeld

excitations are not the same as those generated by the Bateman method, un-
less the functions also satisfy the Bateman conditions of complex collinearity.
In the self dual formulas the * operator is the Hodge * operator with respect
to the Lorentz metric modiﬁed by the impedance of free space. The resulting
self-dual excitations constructed from the two arbitrary functions indeed sat-
isfy the Maxwell-Ampere equations, in virtue of the Maxwell-Faraday equa-
tions and the dispersion relation. The construction yields:

7 SUMMARY

T-Torsion, AˆF, and T-Spin, AˆG, have been demonstrated to be useful
theoretical concepts that give credence to the physical reality of potentials
in electromagnetic theory. The closed integrals of these 3 forms and their
divergences give precise meaning to the concept of coherent structures in a
plasma, and oﬀer possible explanations for certain astrophysical phenomena
such as plasma jets from neutron stars, and the formation of stable rings of
material about rotating astrophysical objects. The constructions can be used
to deﬁne topological transverse modes, similar to the geometric deﬁnitions
of TM and TE modes.

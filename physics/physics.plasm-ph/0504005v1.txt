Abstract

We study anode-directed ionization fronts in curved geometries. When the magnetic eﬀects

can be neglected, an electric shielding factor determines the behavior of the electric ﬁeld and the

charged particle densities. From a minimal streamer model, a Burgers type equation which governs

the dynamics of the electric shielding factor is obtained. A Lagrangian formulation is then derived

to analyze the ionization fronts. Power laws for the velocity and the amplitude of streamer fronts

are observed numerically and calculated analytically by using the shielding factor formulation.

The phenomenon of geometrical diﬀusion is explained and clariﬁed, and a universal self-similar

asymptotic behavior is derived.

INTRODUCTION

In a perfect dielectric medium, charged particles form electrically neutral atoms and

molecules due to powerful electric forces. Since there are not free charges in this medium,

electric current does not ﬂow inside it. However, if a very strong electric ﬁeld is applied to

a medium of low conductivity in such a way that some electrons or ions are created, then

mobile charges can generate an avalanche of more charges by impact ionization, so that a

low temperature plasma is created, and an electric discharge develops [1]. This process is

called electric breakdown and it is a threshold process: there are not changes in the state

of the medium while the electric ﬁeld across a discharge gap is gradually increased, but at

a certain value of the ﬁeld a current is created and observed.

A streamer is a ionization wave propagating inside a non-ionized medium, that leaves

a non-equilibrium plasma behind it. They appear in nature and in technology [1, 2]. A

streamer discharge can be modelled using a ﬂuid approximation based on kinetic theory [3].

Deﬁning the electron density Ne as the integral of the electron distribution function over all

possible velocities, we get

A usual procedure is to approximate the electron current Je as the sum of a drift (electric

and µe and De are the mobility and diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the electrons. Note that, as the

initial charge density is low and there is no applied magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic eﬀects in

equation (2) are neglected. This could not be done in cases where the medium is almost

completely ionized or cases in which an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied, leading to diﬀerent

treatments [4].

Some physical processes can be considered giving rise to the source terms. The most

important of them are impact ionization (an accelerated electron collides with a neutral

molecule and ionizes it), attachment (an electron may become attached when collides with a

neutral gas atom or molecule, forming a negative ion), recombination (a free electron with a

positive ion or a negative ion with a positive ion) and photoionization (the photons created

by recombination or scattering processes can interact with a neutral atom or molecule,

producing a free electron and a positive ion) [5].

It is also necessary to impose equations for the evolution of the electric ﬁeld E. It is usual

to consider that this evolution is given by Poisson’s law,

E =

where e is the absolute value of the electron charge, ε0 is the permittivity of the gas, and

we are assuming that the absolute value of the charge of positive and negative ions is e.

Some simpliﬁcations can be made when the streamer development out of a macroscopic

initial ionization seed is considered in a non-attaching gas like argon or nitrogen. For such

gases, attachment, recombination and photoionization processes are usually neglected. A

minimal model turns out and has been used to study the basics of streamer dynamics

[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In those cases the evolution of electron and positive ion densities in early

stages of the discharge can be written as

On time scales of interest the ion current is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than

impact ionization, in which the ionization coeﬃcient νi is given by the phenomenological

Some properties of planar fronts have been obtained analytically [6, 13, 14] for the min-

imal model. A spontaneous branching of the streamers from numerical simulations has

been observed [9], as it occurs in experimental situations [12]. In order to understand this

branching, the dispersion relation for transversal Fourier-modes of planar negative shock

fronts (without diﬀusion) has been derived [10]. For perturbations of small wave number k,

the planar shock front becomes unstable with a linear growth rate

k. It has been also

|

shown that all the modes with large enough wave number k (small wave length perturba-

tions) grow at the same rate (it does not depend on k when k is large). However, it could

be expected from the physics of the problem that a particular mode would be selected. To

address this problem, a possibility is to consider the eﬀect of diﬀusion. It is also interesting

to investigate the eﬀect of electric screening since, in the case of curved geometries, this

screening might be suﬃcient to select one particular mode.

In this paper, we study the properties and structure of anode-directed ionization fronts

with zero diﬀusion coeﬃcient for curved geometries. We start discussing the consequences

of neglecting the magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects in the physics of the streamer evolution. As a con-

sequence, an electric shielding factor can be introduced which determines the behavior of

the electric ﬁeld and the particle densities. From the minimal streamer model, a Burgers

4

type equation which govern the dynamics of the electric shielding factor is deduced. This

allows us to consider a Lagrangian formulation of the problem simplifying the analytical and

numerical study of the fronts. We apply this new formulation to planar as well as curved

geometries (typical in experimental set-ups). Power laws for the velocity and the amplitude

of streamer fronts are observed numerically. Theses laws are also calculated analytically by

using the shielding factor formulation. The geometrical diﬀusion phenomenon presented in

[15] is explained and clariﬁed, and a universal self-similar asymptotic behavior is derived.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we will show that all the physics

involved in the minimal model can be rewritten in terms of the electric shielding factor, that

determines the behavior of the charge densities and the local electric ﬁeld in the medium.

This allows a simple analysis of the model when written in Lagrangian coordinates. Within

this framework, we perform in Section III, as an illustration of the Lagrangian formulation,

the analysis of planar fronts (without diﬀusion). In Section IV, we study the evolution of

ionization fronts in which the initial seed of ionization is such that the electron density

vanishes strictly beyond a certain point for cylindrical and spherical symmetries. We obtain

precise power laws for both the velocity of the moving fronts and their amplitude. In Section

V, we analyze the special features that appear if the initial seed of ionization is not completely

localized but the charge densities slowly decrease along the direction of propagation. For

curved geometries, this initial distribution gives rise to a new diﬀusion-type behavior that we

call geometrical diﬀusion. A universal self-similar asymptotic shape of the fronts is predicted

and observed. In Section VI, we establish our conclusions.

II. ELECTRIC SHIELDING FACTOR

In this section we will reformulate the problem of the evolution of streamer fronts in

the minimal model by introducing a new quantity called the electric shielding factor, as in

[15]. The equation describing the evolution of the shielding factor makes easier the study of

curved ionization fronts.

We begin with a brief discussion about the consequences of neglecting the magnetic eﬀects

in the minimal streamer model. In this model, it is assumed that the magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects

are negligible, in a ﬁrst approximation, because (i) the ﬂuid velocity of the electrons is

much smaller than the velocity of light, and (ii) the initial magnetic ﬁeld is zero. Strictly

5

speaking, if the magnetic ﬁeld is zero in the evolution of the ionization wave, then Faraday’s

law implies that the electric ﬁeld is conservative (i.e.

E = 0). This means that, in cases

∇ ×

in which the evolution of the ionization wave is symmetric (planar, cylindrical or spherical),

the electric ﬁeld would evolve according to this symmetry, so one can write

E(r, t) = E0(r)u(r, t),

where E0(r) is the initial electric ﬁeld (that is conservative since it is created by an applied

potential diﬀerence) and u(r, t) is some scalar function with the same symmetry as the initial

electric ﬁeld, since

0 =

E = E0 × ∇
u,

∇ ×

and therefore

u is parallel to E0. Consequently, the relation (12) assures that the magnetic

∇

ﬁeld will always be zero if the initial magnetic ﬁeld is zero and it is a direct consequence of

the hypothesis of the minimal streamer model. However, experimental observations indicate

that streamers can change their direction while evolving, suggesting that the ionization

process can be non-symmetric in some cases and that the local magnetic ﬁeld may play a

role, pointing to future modiﬁcations of the model. Nevertheless, as a ﬁrst approach to the

problem, we will consider here symmetric situations. In these cases, the minimal model can

be applied for the streamer evolution, and the relation (12) is strictly correct.

The above discussion leads to an unexpected consequence on the minimal streamer model:

the quantity u deﬁned in (12) determines completely, without any physical approximation,

the electric ﬁeld and the particle densities during the evolution of the ionization wave if

the diﬀusion is neglected. If we take the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D equal to zero, the minimal

streamer model given by equations (7)-(11) can be rewritten as

Subtracting equation (14) from (15), we obtain

Since the electric current is given by neE, expression (19) is simply the divergence of

Amp`ere’s law applied to our case, with the right hand side being the divergence of the

curl of the magnetic ﬁeld, which is always zero. In the particular situation in which the curl

of the magnetic ﬁeld in the gas is negligible, as it occurs in the framework of the minimal

model for symmetric situations (as discussed above), this expression can be also written as

∂E

situation, the electric ﬁeld E is known. Moreover, using equations (22) and (16), we obtain

Equation (12) reveals clearly the physical role played by the function u(r, t) as a factor

modulating the electric ﬁeld E(r, t) at any time. For this reason, u can be termed shielding

factor and determines a screening length that depends on time. This is a kind of Debye’s

length which moves with the front and leaves neutral plasma behind it [15]. As the shielding

factor determines the particle densities, equation (13) implies that the particle densities have

the same symmetry as the initial electric ﬁeld.

with appropriate boundary conditions which should be imposed depending on the particular

physical situations one wishes to consider. Note that we have written the complete minimal

model (with D = 0) in one single equation for the shielding factor u. All the physics in the

minimal model is contained in the evolution equation (34). The shielding factor is related

to charged particle densities and electric ﬁeld through expressions (12), (23) and (24). This

formulation (34) allows us a much simpler analysis than the original one, and will provide

us with some insight into some unsolved problems on streamer formation.

III. THE PLANAR CASE AND THE LAGRANGIAN FORMULATION

In this section, we will use the shielding factor in order to ﬁnd the main features of planar

anode-directed ionization fronts without diﬀusion. This is a very simple way of testing the

usefulness of the new formulation for further generalization, as the results can be compared

with that found in [6] using a diﬀerent approach.

A. Lagrangian formulation

We consider an initial experimental situation as follows. Two inﬁnite planar plates are

situated at z = 0 and z = d respectively (z is the vertical axis). The space between the plates

is ﬁlled with a non-attaching gas like Nitrogen. A stationary electric potential diﬀerence V0

is applied to these plates, so that V (d)

V (0) = V0 > 0. To initiate the avalanche, an initial

−

neutral seed of ionization is set at the cathode, so that ne0(z) = np0(z) = ρ0(z). We study

the evolution of negative ionization fronts towards the anode at z = d.

As the applied potential is constant, the initial electric ﬁeld E0 between the plates results

in

which yields a Lagrangian formulation of the problem. The solutions of this dynamical

system with initial data given by x(0) = x0, u(0) = 1 allows us to compute the proﬁles

for u(x, t) at any time. Then using equations (12), (23) and (24), it is possible to trace

the proﬁles of the electric ﬁeld or the charge densities at diﬀerent times. This has been

done in Fig. 1, in which the electron density ne is plotted as a function of the coordinate

x = z/E0. We have chosen a neutral initial seed of ionization suﬃciently localized near the

negative plate, i.e. the electron and positive ion densities are initially equal and, moreover,

they vanish beyond a certain point in the x axis (mathematically, this situation is described

by saying that the initial condition is of compact support). After evolution, the electron

density converges to a travelling wave, as can be seen in Fig. 1. This travelling wave has a

constant propagation velocity and a constant amplitude, as can be seen in the ﬁgure, and it

is a shock front. This shock front appears only if the initial condition is of compact support,

as we will see later.

B. Analytical computations

The fact that, in the planar case, the integral term in equation (38) does not depend

explicitly on x has an interesting consequence: the velocity of the front can be computed

directly from the equation for the shielding factor and it is completely determined by the

initial condition. Let us assume that the initial density ρ0(x) (for both electron and positive

ion densities) decays suﬃciently fast as x goes to inﬁnity. Then we can neglect the term

formulation in terms of the shielding factor we can see that, after evolution, the ionization wave

converges to a travelling wave of constant velocity and constant amplitude, called a shock front.

Moreover, by using this formulation it is also possible to link the asymptotic behavior

of the initial condition ne0 with the propagation velocity, so that it will be shown that the

initial condition determines the velocity of the front. Suppose that the initial condition for

When this expression is introduced into equation (45), the relation

the propagation velocity. By using this link, in Fig. 2 we have plotted several travelling wave

proﬁles for diﬀerent values of c. In Fig. 2(left), the shielding factor has been plotted, and in

Fig. 2(right), the corresponding electron density, both as a function of ξ = x

ct.

As mentioned above, the minimum value of the propagation velocity c of the travelling

wave is c = 1 (it corresponds to cz = E0). For this velocity, a shock front can be clearly

seen in Fig. 2. Using equation (49), this shock front appears when λ

initial condition is of compact support, i.e. the initial distribution of charge vanishes strictly

C. Accelerated fronts

The treatment given above could suggest that ionization fronts always move with constant

velocity if the physical setting has planar symmetry. However, it can be shown that fronts

with constant velocity appear only if the initial conditions for the particle densities decrease

exponentially with the distance from the cathode. In this context, the compactly supported

case is treated as an exponential decay with inﬁnite argument, as was done in the previous

subsection.

The shielding factor formulation allows us to deduce the existence of accelerated fronts.

This situation occurs when taking an initial ionization decaying at inﬁnity slower than an

exponential. For instance, by taking

with α positive. Near the front, we can take u close to 1, so that from equation (38) we get

IV. CURVED SYMMETRIES

When the initial particle distributions or the initial electric ﬁeld do not have planar

symmetry, the ionization wave behaves quite diﬀerently from what we have described in the

previous section. In particular, the amplitude and the velocity of the travelling wave are

always not constant. The shielding factor formulation can be applied to those more general

curved cases with few changes with respect to the planar case. We will use this formulation

to treat the cases of cylindrical and spherical symmetries. In the cylindrical case, we will

see that the velocity of the fronts varies in time as t−1/2 and the amplitude of the front goes

as 1/t when the initial conditions for the charged particle densities decay suﬃciently fast

with the distance to the cathode. In the spherical case, the velocity goes as t−2/3 and the

amplitude varies as 1/t as in the cylindrical case. Both cases can be dealt in a very similar

way.

A. Cylindrical symmetry

First we analyze the case with cylindrical symmetry. We consider the experimental

situation of two cylindrical plates with radius r0 and r1 ≫
between the plates is ﬁlled, as in the planar case, with a non-attaching gas. A constant

r0, respectively. The space

potential diﬀerence V0 is applied to the plates, so that V (r1)

V (r0) = V0 > 0. Then the

E0(r) =

ur, B =

,

where B is a positive constant and r is the radial coordinate, ranging from r0 to r1 . An

initial neutral seed of ionization ρ0(r) with cylindrical symmetry is taken, so that ne0(r) =

np0(r) = ρ0(r). It is useful to change the spatial variable r to

x =

so that equation (34) for the shielding factor u takes the form of the Burgers equation

forming this equation into the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations

the position of the shock front as a function of time.

The solutions of the dynamical system given by equations (61), (62), (63), depend on the

particular choice of the initial condition for the electron and positive ion densities. In these

equations we have used a neutral initial condition given by ne0(r) = np0(r) = ρ0(r). Consider

now the especial case in which the initial condition ρ0(r) for both densities is compactly

supported, strictly vanishing beyond a certain point. One example of this behavior is given
(r1 −

≪

ρ0(r) =



0 , r0 + δ < r < r1

By using this initial condition, we have plotted in Fig. 3 the electron density distribution ne



corresponding to a given choice of the physical parameters V0, ρ0, δ, r0 and r1. The electron

density has been calculated from the shielding factor u using the relation (23) and plotted as

a function of x at ﬁxed time intervals. In Fig. 3(left), the electron density has been plotted

as a function of coordinate x.

In Fig. 3(right), it has been plotted as a function of the

radial coordinate r with the help of the relation (58). What we can see from the ﬁgure is

a shock with decaying amplitude, separating the region with charge and the region without

charge. The numerical data allows us to measure the velocity of propagation of such front.

In Fig. 4, we have plotted the position of the shock rf as a function of time t. The velocity

of propagation is clearly not constant. However, when we plot the position of the front in

terms of x, one can observe the following linear relation (see inset Fig. 4),

which implies, in the original cylindrical variable r, an asymptotic behavior such that the

position of the front depends on time as

so that the velocity of the front behaves as

the shock front moves with the drift velocity of electrons as it should be expected.

This behavior can also be obtained analytically, as well as the amplitude of the shock

front. This is a considerable advantage of using the formulation in terms of the shielding

factor. To do such computation, it is useful to write, locally near the front, the solution for

u as

This expression can be substituted into equation (59). The computation is simpliﬁed if we

The analytical curve (75) has been plotted as a dashed line in Figs. 3(left) and 3(right). The

agreement with numerical data is seen to be excellent, especially for large times.

B. Spherical symmetry

The physical case in which the initial electric ﬁeld and the initial particle densities have

spherical symmetry shows close similarities with the cylindrical symmetry case. The shield-

ing factor formulation for spherical symmetry has been used in [15] to analyze a typical

in which a potential diﬀerence V (r1)

V (r0) = V0 > 0 is applied. Note that, in this

r0,

case, r is the spherical radial coordinate. The initial seed of ionization is neutral so that

ne0(r) = np0(r) = ρ0(r), and the initial electric ﬁeld E0(r) between the plates is

symmetry (59), can be integrated along characteristics. The results are very similar to

that of cylindrical symmetry shown above [15]. For the case of suﬃciently localized initial

conditions, when the initial electron density strictly vanishes beyond a certain point, there

appears a sharp shock with decaying amplitude, separating the region with charge and the

region without charge. The velocity of propagation of such front is given by the relation

between the position of the front and time: xf (t) = t + x0. This implies, in terms of the

original variable r, an asymptotic behavior

for the position of the front. The velocity of the front is then

The analytical computation of the amplitude and propagation velocity of the shock can be

done, by taking the shielding factor near the front as u(x, t) = 1

a(t)ϕ(ξ), which gives

−

exactly the same equation found in the cylindrical case (70). The reason of this is that

the integral term is neglected in both cases. However, note that the relation between the

coordinate x and the physical radial coordinate is diﬀerent in each case. The position of

the front then satisﬁes xf (t) = t + x0 and the amplitude of the electron density front also

decays with the law ne(xf (t), t) = 1/(t + t0). Details and ﬁgures showing these results can

be found in [15].

V. GEOMETRICAL DIFFUSION AND SELF-SIMILAR BEHAVIOR

In previous sections we have found that, in the framework of the minimal streamer model

without diﬀusion, when an initial seed of ionization is placed near the cathode, a travelling

ionization wave develops towards the anode. The shape and the velocity of this wave depends

on the asymptotic behavior of the initial particle (electron and positive ion) density. If the

initial particle density is compactly supported, i.e. it vanishes beyond a certain point, then

the travelling wave is a shock front, whose velocity is equal to the drift velocity of electrons,

i.e. equal to the modulus E0 of the initial electric ﬁeld. This behavior is found in the case in

which the physical situation has planar, cylindrical or spherical symmetry. In the last two

cases, the velocity, as the initial electric ﬁeld, is not uniform. With respect to the amplitude

of the electron density of the shock, in the planar case, it is constant during the evolution,

but it decays as 1/t in the curved case (cylindrical or spherical symmetry).

When the initial particle density is not compactly supported, but it does decay exponen-

tially with the distance from the cathode, the shock front does not appear. In the planar

case, we have seen that the velocity of the front is then constant and larger than the drift

velocity of the electrons, and the amplitude is constant. However, if the initial particle

density decay slower than an exponential with the distance from the cathode, accelerated

fronts might appear.

Now we are going to investigate the especial features that appear in a case with cylindrical

or spherical symmetry when the initial particle densities are not compactly supported but

they decay exponentially with the distance from the cathode. We will see that (i) a shock

front does not appear, (ii) but a front with an asymptotic self-similar behavior, (iii) whose

velocity depends on time in a similar way as the velocity of the shock front seen in the

previous section. As a remarkable fact, we will note the appearance of a new type of

diﬀusion eﬀect, due to the geometry of the initial physical situation.

Consider the case of an initial electric ﬁeld with a cylindrical symmetry as (57). The

initial electron and positive ion densities are equal and have cylindrical symmetry, so that

ne0(r) = np0(r) = ρ0(r), where r is the radial coordinate. We use the variable x = r2/(2B)

We can solve this problem numerically, integrating along characteristics the dynamical sys-

tem given by equations (61), (62) and (63). The obtained electron density appears in

Fig. 5, shown in constant time intervals, proving that the shock front does not appear. In

Fig. 5(left), we plot the electron density vs x for diﬀerent times. What we see is a travelling

wave with increasing thickness and, remarkably, the center of this front moves with constant

velocity in the coordinate x in the same way as the shock front does. This means that the
velocity of the front center has a similar behavior cr ∼
front that we analyzed in the previous section. In Fig. 5(right), we plot the electron density

t−1/2 that the velocity of the shock

By using the shielding factor formulation, we can prove that the asymptotic local behavior

of the electron density near the front of the travelling wave is self-similar. In order to show

spreads out linearly in time when the initial condition for the particle densities decreases

exponentially with the distance from the cathode. This is a new and remarkable feature,

ﬁrst considered in [15] and explained here, of the curved geometry. It is a diﬀusive behavior

of the solutions of the minimal streamer model caused by the geometry of the electric ﬁeld.

It has been termed geometrical diﬀusion.

In the spherical case, the same behavior is found, with the only diﬀerence being that

the x coordinate is related to the radial coordinate r in a diﬀerent way. We conclude than

geometrical diﬀusion is a universal behavior.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The conclusions of this paper are the following. We have made a thorough study of the

properties and structure of anode-directed ionization fronts without diﬀusion, based on a

minimal streamer model for non-attaching gases. This model includes impact ionization

processes as source terms. The role played by the condition that the magnetic eﬀects in the

streamer discharges are neglected has been discussed. As a consequence, it has been proved

that an electric shielding factor can be deﬁned, and the physical quantities can be expressed

as a function of it.

A Burgers type equation is obtained for the evolution of the electric shielding factor.

Thus, the analytical and numerical study of the ionization fronts can be performed by using

a Lagrangian formulation. The power of this formulation makes it easier to treat the cases

23

of the non-homogeneous initial electric ﬁeld in electric discharges with curved symmetries.

We have applied this new formulation to the discharge between planar and curved elec-

trodes (with cylindrical and spherical symmetries). When an initial seed of ionization is

placed near the cathode, a travelling wave develops towards the anode. The shape and the

velocity of this wave depends on the asymptotic behavior of the initial charged particle den-

sities. If the initial density is compactly supported, then the travelling wave is a shock front,

whose velocity is equal to the drift velocity of electrons. This behavior had been predicted

for the planar case [6], but we have found that a similar situation takes place in the case

that the physical situation has cylindrical or spherical symmetries. We have derived power

laws for the velocity and the amplitude of the shock fronts in the cases of curved symmetry.

When we have cylindrical symmetry, the velocity of the shock front behaves as t−1/2, and

the amplitude behaves as t−1. In the spherical case, the velocity of the shock front behaves

as t−2/3 and the amplitude goes as t−1.

When the initial particle density is not compactly supported, but decays exponentially

with the distance from the cathode, the shock front does not appear. In the planar case, we

have seen that the velocity of the front is then constant and larger than the drift velocity of

the electrons, as predicted in [6]. However, if the initial particle density decay slower than

an exponential with the distance from the cathode, accelerated fronts appear.

In the cases in which the physical situation has cylindrical or spherical symmetries and

the initial ionization seed decays exponentially fast to inﬁnity, we have seen that the velocity

follows the same power laws as the compactly supported case. However, the structure of

the travelling wave is rather diﬀerent. We have proved that the asymptotic behavior of the

charged particle densities is self-similar. Even if the diﬀusion has not been considered, the

front spreads out linearly in time. This is a remarkable feature, ﬁrst considered in [15] and

explained here. It is a diﬀusive behavior of the solutions of the minimal streamer model

caused by the geometry of the electric ﬁeld, and we have called it geometrical diﬀusion.

Our analysis opens the way to consider geometrical eﬀects in the stability of ionization

fronts.

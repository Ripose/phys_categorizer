Abstract

Equilibrium eigenstates of an axisymmetric magnetically conﬁned plasma with toroidal
ﬂow are investigated by means of exact solutions of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic
equations. The study includes ”compressible” ﬂows with constant temperature, T (ψ),
but varying density on magnetic surfaces and incompressible ones with constant density,
̺(ψ), but varying temperature thereon (the function ψ(R, z) is the poloidal magnetic
ﬂux-function with (R, z, φ) cylindrical coordinates). These variations are necessary for
the existence of tokamak steady states with ﬂow. The ”compressible” and incompressible
solutions are associated with the ansatz ω2/T ∝ M0 = constant and d(̺ω2)/dψ = Aψ,
respectively, where ω(ψ) is the rotation frequency. In both cases eigenfunctions of the
form ψℓn = Zℓ(z)Rn(R) (ℓ, n = 1, 2, . . .) describe conﬁgurations with ℓ × n magnetic axes.
Owing to the ﬂow, the respective eigenvalues can be considered in two alternative ways:
either as ﬂow eigenvalues, M ℓ
0 and Aℓ, which depend on a pressure parameter, P0, or as
pressure eigenvalues, P ℓ
0 , which depend on the ﬂow parameters M0 or A. In the context
of the latter consideration when the ﬂow parameters are varied continuously there are
transition points, (M0)m and Am (m = 1, 2, . . .), at which an additional magnetic axis is
formed. This ﬂow-caused change in magnetic topology is possible solely in the presence
of toroidicity because in the limit of inﬁnite aspect ratio the axial ﬂow does not appear in
the equilibrium equation. Also, the lower the aspect ratio the smaller (M0)m and Am. In
addition, the eﬀects of the ﬂow and the aspect ratio on the Shafranov shift are evaluated.

I. Introduction

Over the last decades it has been established experimentally and theoretically that the
ﬂow aﬀects the conﬁnement properties of magnetically conﬁned plasmas. In particular,
the ﬂow and especially the ﬂow shear play a role in the formation of edge transport
barriers (L-H transition) as well as of Internal Transport Barriers (ITBs), two enhanced
conﬁnement modes in tokamaks (e.g. see Ref.
[1] and Refs. cited therein). Also, the
majority of the advanced tokamak scenarios include ﬂow. The ITBs usually are associated
with reversed magnetic shear proﬁles. In addition, a possible magnetic topology of static
(no-ﬂow) equilibria with reversed current density in the core region proposed in Ref. [2]
consists of multitoroidal conﬁgurations having non-nested magnetic surfaces.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium equations for axisymmetric magnetically
conﬁned plasmas with (a) isothermal magnetic surfaces and toroidal ﬂow and (b) incom-
pressible ﬂow of arbitrary direction have been obtained in Ref. [3] and [4], respectively.
Although purely toroidal axisymmetric ﬂows are inherent incompressible because of sym-
metry, the former equilibria can be regarded as ”compressible” in the sense that, alike
the latter ones, the density varies on magnetic surfaces. Respective exact solutions were
constructed in Refs. [3, 5, 6] and [4, 7, 8] and the impact of ﬂow on certain equilibrium
characteristics was examined therein. In particular, in. Ref.
[7] we extended the well
known Solov´ev solution [9, 10] to unbounded incompressible plasmas and found that the
ﬂow and its shear can change the magnetic topology thus resulting in a variety of novel
conﬁgurations of astrophysical and laboratory concern.

The aim of the present study is to examine the possible impact of the ﬂow on the
magnetic topology for equilibria relevant to plasmas of fusion devices. The study includes
equilibria with both ”compressible” and incompressible toroidal ﬂows. The main conclu-
sion is that the ﬂow in conjunction with toroidicity can change the magnetic structure
by the formation of addition magnetic axes. The role of the toroidicity is important, i.e.
this formation is not possible in the limit of inﬁnite aspect ratio.

The outline of the report is as follows. A derivation of the ”compressible” and incom-
pressible equilibrium equations in a uniﬁed manner is ﬁrst reviewed and respective exact
solutions are presented in Sec. II. In Sec. III equilibrium eigenstates of a magnetically
conﬁned plasma surrounded by a boundary of rectangular cross-section and arbitrary as-
pect ratio are constructed. On the basis of these eigenstates the impact of the ﬂow on the
magnetic topology is then studied in conjunction with the role of toroidicity. The eﬀects
of the ﬂow and the aspect ratio on the Shafranov shift are examined in Sec. IV. Finally
the conclusions are summarized in section V.

II. Equilibrium equations and solutions

The ideal axisymmetric MHD equilibrium equations for the cases of ”compressible”
and incompressible toroidal ﬂows are reviewed in this Section. In particular, a uniﬁed
derivation is given without adopting from the beginning relevant energy equations or
equations of states. They will be speciﬁed when necessary later. This rather detailed pre-
sentation aims at making the discussion in the subsequent sections tangible, particularly
as concerns the role of toroidicity.

The starting equations written in standard notation and convenient units are the

following:

∇ · (̺v) = 0
̺(v · ∇)v = J × B − ∇P
∇ × E = 0
∇ × B = J
∇ · B = 0
E + v × B = 0

For axisymmetric magnetically conﬁned plasmas with toroidal ﬂow the divergence-free
magnetic ﬁeld and mass ﬂow can be written in terms of the scalar functions ψ(R, z),

I(R, z) and K(R, z) as

The toroidal current density is then put, by Amp´ere’s law, in the form

B = I∇φ + ∇φ × ∇ψ
̺v = K∇φ.

J = ∆∗ψ∇φ − ∇φ × ∇I

Here (R, φ, z) are cylindrical coordinates with z corresponding to the axis of symmetry,
ψ labels the magnetic surfaces and ∆∗ is the elliptic operator deﬁned as R2∇ · (∇/R2).
By projecting the momentum equation (2) and Ohm’s law (6) along the toroidal
direction, the magnetic ﬁeld, and perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces some integrals
are identiﬁed as ﬂux functions, i.e.
functions constant on magnetic surfaces, and Eqs.
(1-6) are reduced to simpler ones. In particular, the ∇φ-component of (2) yields

implying that I = I(ψ). Also, expressing the electric ﬁeld in terms of the electrostatic
potential, E = −∇Φ, the component of Ohm’s law along B leads to

(12) implies that Φ = Φ(ψ), viz. E is perpendicular to magnetic surfaces. One

Eq.
additional ﬂux function is obtained by the projection of Ohm’s law along ∇ψ:

Therefore, the quantity

With the aid of equations (11)-(14) the components of equation (2) along B and ∇ψ

respectively yield

In order to reduce Eqs. (15) and (16) further an energy equation or an equation of
state is necessary. Owing to the large heat conduction along B, isothermal magnetic
surfaces, T = T (ψ), is an appropriate equation of state for fusion plasmas. In this case
employing the ideal gas law, P = λ̺T , integration of (15) yields

where Ps(ψ) is the pressure in the absence of ﬂow. In the presence of ﬂow the pressure
and therefore for T = T (ψ) the density are in general not constant on magnetic surfaces,
thus giving rise to ”compressibility”.

(̺ω2)′ = 0.

This is a particular form of the axisymmetric equilibrium equation for incompressible ﬂow
of arbitrary direction obtained in Ref. [4].

Both equations (18) and (21) contain four ﬂux-functions, three out of which, i.e. Ps,
I and ω, are common. The fourth function is T for the ”compressible” equation and ̺ for
the incompressible one. For vanishing ﬂow (18) and (21) reduce to the Grad-Shafranov
equation. The ﬂow term in (18) depends on ω and ̺ through ω2/λT and its ψ-derivative
(shear) while solely the shear of the ﬂow term ̺ω2 appears in (21).

Linearized forms of Eqs. (18) and (21) in connection with appropriate assignments of
the free ﬂux functions they contain can be solved analytically. In the present study we
will employ exact solutions as follows.

the Mach number with respect to the sound speed at a reference point (z = 0, R = R0)
with R0 to be speciﬁed later. Note that the toroidal current density proﬁle can vanish on
the plasma boundary via (8).

Eq. (18) then has a separable solution, R(R)Z(z), when the constant of separation is
equal to I1. For conﬁgurations symmetric with respect to mid-plane z = 0 this solution

M0 in (22), A is dimensional.

III. Multitoroidal eigenstates associated with the ﬂow

(cid:17)

In connection with solutions (23) and (25) we are interested in the steady states of a
tokamak the plasma of which is bounded by a conducting wall of rectangular cross-section,
as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, we assume that the plasma boundary coincides with
the outermost magnetic surface; accordingly, the function ψ should satisfy the following
boundary conditions

and

where y± = ±a/R0 and x± = 1 ± b/R0. The equilibrium becomes then a boundary-value
problem. Eigenstates can be determined by imposing conditions (26) and (27) directly to
solutions (23) and (25). Speciﬁcally, (26) applied to the z-dependent part of the solutions
yields the eigenvalues

eigenfunctions are associated with conﬁgurations possessing ℓ magnetic axes parallel to

the axis of symmetry. Condition (27) is pertinent to the R-dependent part of the solution.
Owing to the ﬂow this part contains the parameter M0 in the compressible case and A
in the incompressible one in addition to the pressure parameter P0. (To make further
discussion easier we introduce the symbol F representing either M0 or A; this is particu-
larly convenient to formulate results which are independent of ”compressibility”.) Thus,
condition 27) can determine eigenvalues depending on the parameter P0 which remains
free, F n(P0) (n = 1, 2, 3, . . .), or vice versa, pressure eigenvalues P n
0 (F ) with F being free.
This parametric dependence makes the spectrum of the eigenvalues broader in comparison
with the static one. The eigenvalues depend also on the geometrical quantities R0 and b
but not on a (see Fig. 1); thus, the results to follow are independent of elongation a/b.
The other parameters C1 and C2 contained in (21) and (23) are adapted to normalize ψ
with respect to the magnetic axis and to satisfy the boundary condition (27) respectively.
Also, in the rest of the report dimensionless values of A will be given normalized with
respect to 1 Kgr/(m7 T2 s2). The eigenvalues F n(P0) and P n
0 (F ) can be calculated nu-
merically. For a ﬁxed value of P0, F n satisfy for all n the inequality F n+1 > F n. A similar
relation is satisﬁed by P n
0 for a given value of F . The respective eigenfunctions are con-
nected to conﬁgurations having n magnetic axes perpendicular to the axis of symmetry.
Therefore, the total equilibrium eigenfunctions ψℓn = Zℓ(z)Rn(R) describe multitoroidal
conﬁgurations having ℓ × n magnetic axes. For example, a static doublet conﬁguration,
ψ12, possessing two magnetic axes parallel to z-axis was studied in Ref. [11].

Henceforth, for the sake of simplicity we will restrict the study to eigenfunctions ψ1n
describing multitoroidal conﬁgurations with n magnetic axes along the mid-plane z = 0.
As an example the ψ12-conﬁguration for ”compressible” ﬂow is shown in (Fig. 2). For
vanishing ﬂow, tokamak multitoroidal conﬁgurations of this kind were investigated in Ref.
[2] in connection with hole current density proﬁles which can reverse in the core region;
current reversal is possible because the conﬁgurations have non-nested magnetic surfaces.
It is noted that for static equilibria only pressure eigenvalues are possible. In the presence
of ﬂow we examined eigenstates with the lowest of the pressure eigenvalues P n
0 (F ) by
varying continuously the ﬂow parameter F starting from a value close to the ﬁrst-order

static one, P 1
0 (F ≈ 0). It should be noted here that for incompressible ﬂow, A = 0 does
not necessarily imply static equilibrium because of the non-zero shear [see Eq. (24)]. It
turns out that there are transition points Fm (m = 1, 2, . . .) at which the conﬁguration
changes topology by the formation of an additional magnetic axis (The subscript m here
indicating a transition point must not be mixed up with the superscript n indicating the
order of an eigenvalue). For incompressible ﬂow this is shown in Fig. 3. Speciﬁcally, the
singly toroidal conﬁguration 3(a) has eigenfunction ψ11 with eigenvalue P 1
0 (A = 0.09).
By varying the ﬂow parameter the pressure (eigenvalue) decreases and the conﬁguration
is shifted outwards and is compressed in the outer region while the pressure becomes
lower (3(b)). Then, as the ﬂow parameter reaches the ﬁrst transition point A1 = −0.01
a second magnetic axis is formed in the outer region close to the boundary causing the
ﬁrst one to be shifted inwards (3(c)). This transition point is associated with pressure
eigenvalue P 2
0 (A = A1). By a further increase of the ﬂow (lower negative values of A) the
outer magnetic island becomes bigger and the whole conﬁguration is shifted outwards up
to the next transition point A2 = −0.1 associated with pressure eigenvalue P 3
0 (A = A2)
(Fig. 3(d)) at which as before a third magnetic axis is formed in the outer region; thus,
the conﬁguration consists of three magnetic islands (Fig. 3(e)) and is shifted outwards as
the ﬂow increases even more (Fig. 3(f)). This procedure is carried on until the formation
of n magnetic axes and it is also possible for ”compressible” ﬂow. It can approximately
be regarded as a quasi-static ”evolution” of the plasma due to the ﬂow variation through
ﬂow-depended pressure equilibrium eigenstates. Therefore, it is not possible for static
equilibria. An animation showing this ”evolution” is available in Ref [12]. Alternatively,
varying continuously the pressure parameter P0 one can ﬁnd pressure transition points,
(P0)m, associated with ﬂow eigenvalues.

as the incompressible ﬂow parameter A is decreased for aspect ratio α = 3. The values of

(e) A = −0.122, (f) A = −0.2.

For aspect ratio α = 3 and compressible ﬂow the ﬁrst transition velocity from a singlet
to a doublet conﬁguration is of the order of 105 m/s. Velocities of this order have been
measured in tokamaks and therefore the change in magnetic topology by the ﬂow can be
experimentally examined.

It is emphasized that the change of the magnetic topology due to the ﬂow is not
possible in the limit of inﬁnite aspect ratio because in this limit the equilibrium equations
do not contain the axial velocity regardless of ”compressibility”. Indeed, for a cylindrical

Eqs. (29) and (30) follow respectively from (16) and (17) of Ref [13] for vanishing poloidal
velocity (F ′ = 0). Also, note that the pressure becomes a ﬂux-function.

In addition, toroidicity aﬀects qualitatively the eigenvalues and the transition points.
We examined this impact by varying the aspect ratio α and found the following results:

1. The eigenvalues P n

aspect ratio decreases. For example, for α = 3 and α = 2 one ﬁnds M 2
M 2

0 and F n (”compressible and incompressible) become lower as the
0 = 2.8 and

0 = 2.3, respectively.

2. The smaller α the lower the transition Mach numbers (M0)m and Am (for any m).
For example, for α = 3 and α = 2 the respective ﬁrst-transition Mach numbers are
(M0)1 = 1.692 and (M0)1 = 1.338 and the ﬁrst-transition incompressible points are
A1 = −0.083 and A1 = −0.448.

The ”compressible” transition velocities are found to be in general supersonic. Experi-
[14] and [15]. Owing
mental supersonic toroidal velocities have been reported in Refs.
to the above mentioned dependence of the transition points on α, however, it is possible
to have subsonic transitions for appropriate low values of α. Thus, in this case the tran-
sitions may be realized easier in spherical tokamaks; the minimum subsonic value of the
ﬁrst-transition point (M0)1 is 0.62 and corresponds to a compact toroid (α = 1).

IV. Shafranov shift

We evaluated the impact of the ﬂow and the aspect ratio on the Shafranov shift of
eigenstates with a single magnetic axis. (It is reminded that the Shafranov shift is deﬁned
as the displacement of the magnetic axis with respect to the geometrical center of the
conﬁguration, ∆x ≡ xm.a. − 1.) The results are summarized as follows.

1. As M0 increases or A decreases the Shafranov shift increases. This increase for
”compressible and incompressible equilibria can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, respec-
It is interesting to note that for large positive values of A the Shafranov
tively.
shift can become negative. As an example for α = 3 and A = 0.09 the shift is
−0.0274. This means that the magnetic surfaces in this case are shifted inward. An
inward shift of magnetic surfaces associated with poloidal ﬂow in quasi-isodymanic
equilibria was reported in Ref.
[16]. Also, suppression of the Shafranov shift by a
properly shaped toroidal rotation proﬁle was found in Ref. [17].

2. The lower the aspect ratio the larger the Shafranov shift. This is shown in tables 3

and 4 for two diﬀerent values of the pressure parameter P0.

V. Summary and Conclusions

Equilibrium eigenstates of a magnetically conﬁned plasma with toroidal ﬂow sur-
rounded by a boundary of rectangular cross-section have been investigated within the
framework of ideal MHD theory. ”Compressible” ﬂows associated with uniform temper-
ature but varying density on magnetic surfaces and incompressible ones with uniform
density but varying temperature thereon have been examined on the basis of respective
reduced equations [(18) and (21)] and exact solutions [(23) and (25)]. The ﬂow eﬀect on
the magnetic topology of the eigenstates has been examined by means of the parameters
M0 and A associated with the quantities ω2/T in the ”compressible” and ̺ω2 in incom-
pressible case, respectively. The exact ”compressible” solutions considered are shearless
[(ω2/(T ))′ = 0] while the incompressible ones have non-zero shear [(̺ω2)′ 6= 0].

Owing to the ﬂow one can consider either pressure eigenvalues, (P0)n n = 1, 2, . . .

10

0 > P n

with the ﬂow parameter F being free (F represents either M0 or A) or alternatively ﬂow
eigenvalues F n with free P0. For ﬁxed F in the former case and ﬁxed P0 in the latter
one, the eigenvalues satisfy the relations P n+1
0 and F n+1 > F n, respectively. The
respective eigenfunctions for the poloidal magnetic ﬂux-function ψ can describe multi-
toroidal conﬁgurations with n magnetic axes located on the mid-plane z = 0. When M0
is increased or A is decreased continuously there are transition points Fm (m = 1, 2, . . .)
at which an additional magnetic axis appears. Alternatively, by varying continuously the
pressure parameter P0 there are transition points (P0)m associated with ﬂow eigenvalues at
which an additional magnetic axis is formed. This change in magnetic topology, possible
only in the presence of ﬂow, is crucially related to toroidicity because in the limit of in-
ﬁnite aspect ratio the equilibrium equations are ﬂow independent. The above mentioned
”ﬂow-triggered” transitions can be approximately viewed as a quasi-static ”evolution”
of the plasma by continuous ﬂow variation through pressure eigenstates or alternatively
by continuous pressure variation through ﬂow eigenstates. The transition points have
the following dependence on the aspect ratio α: the lower α the smaller (M0)m in the
”compressible” case and Am in the incompressible one.

Also, we have examined the impact of the ﬂow and the aspect ratio α (as a measure
of the toroidicity) on the Shafranov shift. The results show that the shift (a) increases
as M0 take larger values and A smaller ones and (b) increases as α takes lower values.
Furthermore, for large positive values of A the shift can become negative.

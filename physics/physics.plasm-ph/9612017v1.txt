Abstract

Collisionless regime kinetic models for coherent nonlinear Alfv´en wave dynam-

ics are studied using ﬂuid moment equations with an approximate closure anzatz.

Resonant particle eﬀects are modelled by incorporating an additional term repre-

senting dissipation akin to parallel heat conduction. Unlike collisional dissipation,

parallel heat conduction is presented by an integral operator. The modiﬁed deriva-

tive nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation thus has a spatially nonlocal nonlinear term

describing the long-time evolution of the envelope of parallel-propagating Alfv´en
β)−1 singu-

waves, as well. Coeﬃcients in the nonlinear terms are free of the (1

larity usually encountered in previous analyses, and have very a simple form which

−

clariﬁes the physical processes governing the large amplitude Alfv´enic nonlinear dy-

namics. The nonlinearity appears via coupling of an Alfv´enic mode to a kinetic

ion-acoustic mode. Damping of the nonlinear Alfv´en wave appears via strong Lan-

dau damping of the ion-acoustic wave when the electron-to-ion temperature ratio

is close to unity. For a (slightly) obliquely propagating wave, there are ﬁnite Lar-

mor radius corrections in the dynamical equation. This eﬀect depends on the angle

of wave propagation relative to B0 and vanishes for the limit of strictly parallel
propagation. Explicit magnetic perturbation envelope equations amenable to fur-

ther analysis and numerical solution are obtained. Implications of these models for

collisionless shock dynamics are discussed.

I. Introduction

It is widely believed that Alfv´en waves play an important role in in-

terplanetary plasmas. High level of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave

activity and shock waves are observed in the planetary and solar wind

plasmas [1-3]. The plasma environment is characterized by a quite weak

mean interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld and large amplitude magnetic ﬁeld

ﬂuctuations caused by Alfv´en and magnetosonic waves. Thus, nonlinear

eﬀects play an important role in the evolution of such waves. Interest in

large-amplitude Alfv´en wave dynamics arose from the attempts to under-

stand the steepening of wave trains and shock formation in space as well

as from general interest in nonlinear waves as a whole.

Previous studies have shown [4-6] that nonlinear Alfv´en and fast mag-

netosonic waves are described by the derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger

equation (DNLS). In this model, a parallel ponderomotive force of a high-

amplitude wave perturbs the plasma density. The force squeezes plasma

out the regions of larger magnetic ﬁeld, locally decreasing the plasma

density, and increasing the Alfv´en wave velocity. As the amplitude of a

circularly polarized Alfv´en wave varies on time scales much slower than

the wave frequency, the section of a wave train with higher amplitude

propagates faster than the part with lower one. This gives rise to nonlin-

ear steepening of the large-amplitude Alfv´en wave. Dispersion, as usual,

ultimately controls steepening. The DNLS thus describes the long time-

scale dynamics of the envelope of such Alfv´en waves. The DNLS is an

integrable equation, which describes soliton and multi-soliton solutions,

shock waves, modulation instability of solitons [7-9] etc. As was shown

by Longtin and Sonnerup [10] and Wong and Goldstein [11] (from anal-

yses of the full set of MHD equations), modulation instability occurvs

for left-hand polarized waves if β < 1 and for right-hand polarized waves

if β > 1. This DNLS modulation instability is strongly sensitive to the

(1

sign of the coeﬃcient of the cubic nonlinearity, which is propotional to
β)−1. Indeed, at β ∼= 1 (typical of solar wind plasma), the sound speed
approaches the Alfv´en velocity, and resonant energy exchange between

−

2

sound and Alfv´en waves is strong, in the absence of parallel dissipation.

Then, the Alfv´en wave is always in phase with the acoustic wave, giving

rise to fast steepening of the front of the nonlinear Alfv´en wave train. The
β)−1. Signiﬁcant con-

rate of the steepening is roughly proportional to (1

version of Alfv´en wave energy into ion thermal energy (i.e. ion heating)

−

occurs as well. It is interesting to note that the overwhelming prepon-

derance of theoretical work in this ﬁeld of quasi-parallel Alfv´enic shocks

and solitons is based upon a simple MHD plasma model. Thus, with

the notable exceptions of Ref. [6,12-14], the theoretical ‘lore’ of nonlinear

Alfv´en waves in a collisionless, β

1 plasma is built upon a conceptual

paradigm constructed for a collisional, β < 1 system. This state of aﬀairs

is due, in part, to the intractability and unwieldiness of straightforward

kinetic analysis of nonlinear Alfv´en waves. In this paper, we oﬀer a sim-

plier approach which exploits recent developments in the theory of ﬂuid

∼

modelling of kinetic eﬀects.

We can expect that the inﬂuence of kinetic eﬀects, such as Landau

damping must become important when β approaches unity. A fully ki-

netic calculation was undertaken by Rogister [5] for the case of a high-beta

plasma. For parallel propagation, his results counside with equations ob-

tained later by Mjølhus and Wyller [12, 6] and Spangler [13, 14]. The

eﬀect of Landau damping appears in the DNLS via an additional cubic
β)−1 singu-

term which is an integral operator over space. There is no (1

larity in the nonlinear derivative term. The nonlocality is a consequence

−

of the ﬁnite time history of an ion transit through an envelope modulation

(i.e. the coherence time of an ion with the modulation is not inﬁnitesimal

in comparison to the modulation growth time). Thus nonlinear Alfv´en

wave dynamics are nonlocal, and not governed by local spatial derivatives

of the perturbed ﬁeld, alone. The other attempts to include Landau

damping in the nonlinear Alfv´en wave evolution used kinetics to calcu-

late second-order density (or pressure) perturbation, but the DNLS-like

equation (for

b) was obtained from MHD equations. Mjølhus and Wyller

[12, 6] used a guiding center formalism and Spangler [13, 14] used the

full Vlasov equation. Both methods predict a nonlocal integral term, and

e

3

the coeﬃcients of the nonlinear terms coinside with those of Rogister [5].

In these cases, the coeﬃcient of the derivative cubic nonlinear term does

not change sign at β = 1, except for large values of Te/Ti (the electron-
to-ion temperature ratio). The coeﬃcient of the nonlocal term is always

negative. Both coeﬃcients of the nonlinear terms (cubic and nonlocal)

depend strongly on β and on Te/Ti.

Obviously, a simple ﬂuid model of collisionless shocks is desirable for

reasons of tractibility. However, kinetic eﬀects are essential for describing

interplanetary plasma dynamics.

It is known that ﬂuid models poorly

represent most kinetic eﬀects. Several authors have suggested that kinetic

eﬀects, such as Landau damping may be modelled in ﬂuid equations by

adding parallel dissipation terms [15,16]. Recently, a closure method for

modelling of kinetic eﬀects was developed [17-21] and applied to ion-

temperature gradient instabilities using gyroﬂuid models. This closure

anzatz for ﬂuid moment equations i) ensures particle, momentum and

energy conservation, ii) takes a simple form in wave-number space, and

iii) has a linear response function very close to that of a collisionless,

Maxwellian plasma.

In this paper we use the simplest version of the

method, namely that proposed by Hammet and Perkins [17].

In this paper we investigate eﬀects of dissipation on the nonlinear,

parallel-propagating Alfv´en wave. We ﬁrst use one-ﬂuid MHD equations

with parallel dissipation coeﬃcients µk and χk which are constant and
independent of mode frequency and wave-number. Later we replace con-

stant χk with the integral operator representation of Hammet and Perkins
[17], and obtain a modiﬁeld DNLS similar to that obtained by Mjølhus

and Wyller [12, 6] and Spangler [13, 14]. However, our approach yields

expressions for coeﬃcients of the nonlinear terms which are much simpler

than theirs and allows clear, unambiguous physical interpretation of the

results. We also derive the Te/Ti dependence using two-ﬂuid MHD equa-
tions. In an ion-acoustic wave, ion density perturbations of the electron

background are mediated by electric ﬁeld eﬀects. In collisionless plasmas

the ion-acoustic branch, thus, replaces the acoustic branch as caused by

4

gas-kinetic pressure perturbations. The results indicate that the nonlin-

earity of Alfv´en waves in collisionless plasma is controlled by the coupling

of the Alfv´en mode to an ion-acoustic mode, i.e. an ion-density pertur-

bation mediated by an electron responce electric ﬁeld. This is in contrast

to the conventional view [4,7,8] of this nonlinearity as due to a pondero-

motive (i.e. a gas-kinetic/collisional) plasma density perturbation. The

kinetic damping on resonant particles is nothing more than the usual
strong Landau damping of an ion-acoustic wave for Te ≃
ing leads to enhanced ion heating which further raises Ti/Te.

Ti. This damp-

We also consider the case of a slightly obliquely propagating wave.

There, one can expect that other kinetic eﬀects may be relevant to the

dynamics. It is shown that the E

B drift in the electric ﬁeld produced by

charge separation in an ion-acoustic wave with an ambient magnetic ﬁeld

×

is not signiﬁcant. Another eﬀect which is important, however, is caused

by gyro-averaged electric and magnetic ﬁelds acting on a particle over
the scale of a Larmor orbit. (There are no (k⊥ρi)2 eﬀects on dispersion
in the DNLS approximation. Such eﬀects may appear in higher-order in

b/B0 calculations.) This eﬀect enters the modiﬁed DNLS in a way similar
to collisional dissipation. The ﬁnite Larmor radius correction depends on
e
the angle of propagation of a wave and disappears for a strictly parallel-

propagating waves. We explore modulational stability for the general

case of a dissipative nonlinear Alfv´en wave. This instability is important

when one considers the origin and evolution of solitons, wave packets,

shock waves, etc.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we de-

rive the evolution equation for dissipative nonlinear parallel-propagating

Alfv´en waves. In Section III the modiﬁed DNLS with the resonant par-

ticle eﬀect is obtained. In Section IV we consider the inﬂuence of ﬁnite

Larmor radius corrections to the dynamics of a slightly oblique, nonlin-

ear Alfv´en wave. In Section V we investigate the modulation instability

of dissipative nonlinear Alfv´en waves. Section VI is a discussion of the

results obtained.

II. Dissipative Nonlinear Alfv´en Waves

We obtain the equation governing nonlinear wave dynamics from a

multiple time scale expansion of the dissipative MHD equations. Dissi-

pation is included via the parallel viscosity µk or the parallel heat con-
ductivity χk. We considered both these cases for the following reason.
= 0, corresponds to the three-moment ﬂuid model of
The ﬁrst case, µ

Landau damping. The four-moment ﬂuid model should contain both χk
and µk to close the equations. As shown in Ref. [17], the best ﬁt of
the linear-response function of of this model to the linear-response func-
tion of a Maxwellian plasma is achieved when µk = 0 and χk 6
is the second case we consider here. Note that any closure of this sort

= 0. This

which tacitly assumes a Maxwellian plasma intrinsically fails to capture

the strong local modiﬁcation of the distribution function associated with

large-amplitude turbulence, trapping, etc.

In the derivation, we follow Ref. [4]. We assume a plane wave prop-

agating in the z direction. Thus, all quantities are functions of z and t.

Eqs. (4) and (5) are, at second order, equations for linear Alfv´en

waves. One may easily show that for all t(2) one may set b2 and v2 to zero

For a dispersive term [6,24] one must invoke ﬁnite Larmor radius eﬀects.

Since Eq. (15) describes the transverse components of b, there is no in-

ﬂuence of parallel dissipation eﬀects on the linear dispersive term. We

thus add a general form of this term to obtain a DNLS-like magnetic per-

turbation envelope equation. Introducing τ = t(2) and φ = (b1x + ib1y)/B0

coherent nonlinear dynamics of an Alfv´en wave train subject to damping.

Damping results in the appearance of a new nonlocal integral contribution

to the envelope equation. We deﬁne the integral dissipation operator as:

moment approximation (µk 6

Indeed, it lacks a free cubic nonlinear contribution to the

= 0 model) describes the nonlinear physics

expression for u2. This is in agreement with the conclusions of Ref. [17],
which, stated simply, are the higher the moment approximation used,

the better the description of Landau damping in a ﬂuid model which

results. In particular, the linear response function of the three-moment

ﬂuid model is much closer to the exact Maxwellian linear response func-

tion then that of the two-moment ﬂuid model. From now on we use the
three-moment ﬂuid model (χk 6

= 0).

III. Coherent Nonlinear Alfv´en Waves with Landau Damping

Using the χ

heat ﬂux.

Eq. (16) together with Eq. (25) recovers the modiﬁed derivative non-

linear Schr¨odinger equation governing the envelope of nonlinear Alfv´en

1

and M (1)

modes subject to Landau damping. Fig. 1 represents the dependence of
the factors M (1)
gler [13]. This case corresponds to the Te/Ti = 1 case of Spangler. The
coeﬃcient M1 of Spangler is positive, always. The coeﬃcient M (1)
in our
analysis changes sign at β = 1, although where negative, its absolute value

on 1/β for comparison with the work by Span-

1

2

is small. The disagreement is related to the lack of higher moments in

12

the closure scheme we use. The coeﬃcients M (1)
and M2 of Spangler are
negative and look alike. Analytical expressions for the coeﬃcients in our

2

approach are much simpler than those obtained from kinetic calculations.

The phenomenon which is described here by Eqs. (25), (26) is typical for

other resonance phenomena. The sharp resonance without damping (here

the resonance between Alfv´en and sound waves) is, of course, smoothed

by increasing damping.

In other words, there is resonance broadening

caused by the interaction of particles with a wave. In this respect, the

coupling to dissipation calculated here is the coherent analogue of non-

linear ion Landau damping.

Until now we have considered only one-ﬂuid magnetohydrodynam-

ics. Based on this model, we derived the Alfv´en-sound wave resonance

broadening in a DNLS-like equation. Astrohysical plasmas are essen-

tially collisionless, i.e. the wave-length is much larger than mean free

path, λ

ℓmf p. Thus, an ion-acoustic mode replaces the sound wave in
the collisionless regime. Hence, it is natural to adopt the perspective that

≪

the nonlinearity of ﬁnite-amplitude Alfv´en waves arises from an ion den-

sity perturbation, that is from coupling of the ion-acoustic and Alfv´en

branches of the plasma oscillation.

In other words, we must consider

electrostatic density perturbations instead of pure neutral density per-

turbation as in a sound wave. The electric ﬁelds of the ion-acoustic wave

play a role in the dynamics of oblique nonlinear Alfv´en waves, as will be

shown later. To include the ion-acoustic wave coupling eﬀects instead

of the gas-kinetic pressure perturbation, we must use two-ﬂuid dynamics

for both electron and ion ﬂuids. The longitudinal momentum equation,

Eq. (2), for ions in a collisionless plasma is:

where ϕ is the electric potential. We neglect wave damping by electrons,
which is always much smaller than damping on ions, i.e. γelect./γion ≃

me/mi. Due to the quasineutrality of ion-acoustic waves, the ﬁrst nonva-
nishing term of the expansion of the Boltzman distribution for electrons

is:

Upon substituting this into Eq. (27), and formally deﬁning (for ions)

When Te/Ti ≫

(neglecting the feeble damping by electrons). In the opposite case, Te/Ti ≃
1, there is strong ion Landau damping. This is the case of the one-ﬂuid

calculation. So, we must redeﬁne the ﬁt coeﬃcient:

a Maxwellian plasma fails, as well.

IV. Slightly Oblique Nonlinear Alfv´en Waves with Landau Damping

and Finite Larmor Radius Eﬀects

In the previous sections we considered Alfv´en waves propagating

strictly parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld lines. Here we try to generalize

our approach to waves propagating at a small angle to the magnetic

ﬁeld. It has been shown [12, 23-25] that dissipationless oblique nonlinear

Alfv´en waves are governed by the DNLS equation, as well. We investi-

gate here the inﬂuence of kinetic eﬀects on wave dynamics. To include

kinetic eﬀects in the ﬂuid model of the DNLS we use a two-ﬂuid gyroﬂuid

15

model [18,19]. Here we construct the simplest model which includes ki-

netic eﬀects such as ﬁnite gyro-frequency, Landau damping, etc. We

omit gyro-viscous corrections to the Reynolds stress. These corrections

are small for the slightly oblique propagation case in straight ﬁeld ge-

ometry, and can be incorporated (approximately) into the viscous model

considered in Section II.

Typically, the gyroﬂuid equations are written in components pro-
jected onto the magnetic ﬁeld direction, z′, and perpendicular to it. It

is more convenient to us to work in the frame of a wave propagating in
1 relative to the z′ direc-
the z direction, which makes some angle Θ
tion. We choose the y direction coincident with y′. We leave variables

≪

‘unprimed’ when measured in the frame of a wave, and use primes for

variables measured in the frame of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld. We con-

sider contributions of kinetic eﬀects separately for every equation of the

system (1)-(5). The equation for the transverse ﬂux is obtained from the

Maxwell equations

E = (

1/c)∂B/∂t,

B = (4π/c)J and the Ohm’s

law. We write the generalized Ohm’s law as follows:

we have set ρ0 = const, ρ1 = 0. The ﬁrst term has already been accounted
for. The second term leads to an additional term on the right-hand-side

The terms on the right-hand-side give rise to a linear dispersion term in

the DNLS. This term describes dispersion due to ﬁnite ion Larmor radius.

In gyroﬂuid models there is no correction to the transverse momentum

16

equation, Eq. (4). We write it with the substitution of B0 by B0z, as is
obvious for oblique propagation:

Another eﬀect we should consider is the gyro-averaging of electric

and magnetic ﬁelds over the Larmor orbits of particles. This eﬀect enters

the equations via a diﬀerential operator which approaches unity when

the ion Larmor radius vanishes. Since it acts on ﬁelds only and because

we construct the model which must reduce to MHD in the case of zero

ion Larmor radius, ﬁnite gyro-radius corrections appear only in Eq. (2),

leaving Eqs. (1) and (3) unchanged. In the case of oblique propagation,

Eqs. (1)-(3) are:

Here we have already used the quasineutrality condition together with

Eq. (28) for the electric potential perturbation. This appears on the right-
hand-side of Eq. (39) as a gradient of p∗. This accounts for the charge

separation in an ion-acoustic wave, and the subsequent gyro-averaging

of the electric ﬁeld associated with the electron responce. Eq. (40) is a
trivial rewriting of Eq. (3) for the quantity p∗.

The operator J0, which carries out the gyro-averaging operation, is
a linear operator. It is simply a Bessel function represented in Fourier

Equations (36)-(40) replace Eqs. (1)-(5) for the case of an obliquely

propagating wave subject to Landau damping and including ﬁnite Larmor

radius eﬀects. The procedure for derivation of the DNLS-like equation

describing nonlinear, obliquely propagating Alfv´en waves is similar to

that explained in Section II for parallel-propagating waves, but requires

a bit more algebra. From Eqs. (36) and (37) we ﬁnally arrive at the

DNLS-like equation, Eq. (16), with a new ﬁeld:

ψ =

b1x + ib1y + B0x
B0z

(43)

18

instead of φ = (b1x + ib1y)/B0. One can mention that in terms of the ﬁeld φ
the DNLS for oblique waves is more complicated and contains Korteweg-

de Vries nonlinearities. These terms are proportional to B0x and, thus,
disappear in the case of strictly parallel propagation.

The velocity perturbation u2 is found from the second-order expan-
sion of Eqs. (38)-(40). After one integration these equations can be writ-

ten in the frame moving with the wave as:

at z′ = z. Thus, the main contribution to this integral is not from the

interesting that this operator does not correspond to pure dissipation,
JL itself consists of both symmetric

V. Modulation Instability

It has been demonstrated [9,26,27] that modulation instability leads

to the destruction of wave trains and the production of solitons, trans-

fer of energy from large-scale wave-modes to (damped) small-scale modes,

the appearance of shock waves and shocklets in the vicinity of bow-shocks

of planets, etc.. As was already mentioned, waves described by the DNLS

can be modulationly unstable depending on the sense of their polariza-

tion. Left-hand polarized waves are unstable when the cubic nonlinearity

coeﬃcient is positive, and right-hand polarized waves are unstable when

it is negative. In this Section we investigate the modulation instability of

dissipative wave packets described by the modiﬁed DNLS, Eqs. (16) and

(12’), and compare the result with that of the DNLS with the resonant

particle term. We write the general equation as follows:

pressing the solution of Eq. (52) in the form:

φ = ueiϑ,

where u(τ, z) and ϑ(τ, z) are real functions and substituting this into Eq. (52),

we obtain two equations for the real and imaginary parts, respectively:

where lm = 1/k is the modulation length. One can see that those waves
which are modulationally stable in the dissipationless limit become unsta-

ble when collisional dissipation increases. The growth rate of modulation

instability is proportional to the ratio of the coeﬃcients of the nonlocal

and the cubic nonlinearity terms. When the nonlocal term coeﬃcient is

stability which depends on the sense of polarization of the wave [10,14].

Modulation stability analysis of the modiﬁed DNLS with the resonant

particle integral operator has been implemented in Refs. [14,29]. The

growth rate for this case is:

Modulation instability now appears for waves which are stable in the

absence of resonant particle eﬀects. The growth rate again is proportional

to the nonlocal-to-nonlinear term coeﬃcient ratio. Roughly, this growth

rate is M2/M1 times smaller than the modulation instability growth rate
predicted by the simple DNLS.

VI. Conclusions

In this paper we have considered the inﬂuence of kinetic eﬀects on

nonlinear Alfv´en wave dynamics. The eﬀects under consideration are

i) the dissipative (collisional) longitudinal viscous and thermal ﬂuxes,

ii) resonant particle eﬀects, i.e. Landau damping, iii) the E

B drift

and ﬁnite Larmor radius eﬀects such as those associated with the gyro-

×

averaging of ﬁelds over the Larmor orbits of particles. All calculations

have been based on ﬂuid moment and gyroﬂuid models with Landau

damping modelled by additional dissipation-like terms. The results ob-

tained are given below.

a. Dissipative (collisional) longitudinal viscosity, µk, and thermoconduc-
tivity, χk, give rise to an additional, new integral nonlinear term in

24

the evolution equation for the nonlinear Alfv´en waves, and also re-
β)−1 singularity of the derivative nonlinear term in the

solve the (1

MHD model. The dissipative integral operator is diﬀerent from the

−

integral operator representing resonant particle eﬀects, and is given

by Eq. (17).

b. Modulationally stable dissipationless Alfv´en waves become unstable

when dissipation is included. The growth rate is proportional to the

ratio of the coeﬃcients of the integral and nonlinear terms. This

is similar to the case of the modiﬁed DNLS with Landau damping,

studied in Ref. [14].

c. Using the three-moment ﬂuid equations [17], we derived the modiﬁed

DNLS including Landau damping eﬀects. Since in this model dissi-

pation is no longer an algebraic constant, but an integral operator

given by Eq. (21), we obtained exactly the same functional form of

the equation as that obtained from lengthy, full kinetic calculations

[6,14]. However, the coeﬃcient of both the nonlinear and resonant

particle operator (nonlocal) terms obtained here are much simpler,

thus facilitating clear physical interpretation and further analysis.

Particularly, the phenomenon under study is just the broadening of

the resonance between acoustic and Alfv´enic branches due to the res-

onant particle interaction with a sound wave.

d. In the collisionless regime, there is coupling of Alfv´en and ion-acoustic

waves, instead of coupling of Alfv´en and sound waves. The resonant

particle eﬀect is then strong Landau damping of the ion-acoustic wave
when Te/Ti ≃
ﬁcients M1 and M2 of the nonlinear and integral terms, respecitvely.
These coeﬃcients are much simpler than those obtained full Vlasov

1. We obtained the temperature ratio dependent coef-

model [14]. However, they display similar qualitative dependence on

the β and Te/Ti parameters, Figs. 2a, 2b.

e. In the case of obliquely propagating waves, other kinetic eﬀects may

be relevant. It was shown that even though the E

B drift veloc-

ity is not zero (electric ﬁeld is generated from charge separation in

×

25

an ion-acoustic wave), it does not contribute to the dynamic wave

equation. Another eﬀect which does contribute is a gyro-averaging

of electric and magnetic ﬁelds acting on a particle over a Larmor

orbit of this particle. This eﬀect depends on the angle between the

wave propagation direction and the ambient magnetic ﬁeld direction
as sin2 Θ, and vanishes for a strictly parallel-propagating wave. We
studied this eﬀect using a gyroﬂuid model constructed from gyroﬂuid

equations [18,19]. This eﬀect results in additional terms in the am-

plitude evolution equation. These terms are expressed in terms of

the dissipation integral operator, given in Eq. (17). Hence, this ef-

fect can be viewed as some speciﬁc nonlinear dissipation (similar to

collisional dissipation) of an obliquely propagating wave due to ﬁnite

Larmor radius.

We have shown in this paper that MHD models with linear kinetic

corrections provide correct quantitative description of eﬀects such as the

dynamics of high-amplitude Alfv´en waves. It is signiﬁcant that the ex-

pressions obtained are, nevertheless, much simpler than those obtained

from kinetic (Vlasov) calculations, thus facilitating further analysis and

numerical calculations, and allowing very clear physical interpretation.

There are some points unresolved in this work. First, when the ampli-

tude of a wave is high, there are particles trapped in the wave. These

particles traverse the regions of lower ﬁeld and bounce between the re-

gions of higher ﬁeld. This trapped motion in a beat wave results in am-

plitude oscillation of this wave at the particle bounce frequency, similar

to the nonlinear Landau damping process. Obviously, such phenomena

cannot be represented by a theory based on an assumption that the dis-

tribution function deviates slightly from a local Maxwellian. Obviously,

the physical process of trapping will lead to plateau formation and other
modiﬁcation of Maxwellian structure. Indeed, waves with b⊥/B0 ∼
have large trapping width and undoubtedly lead to signiﬁcant distortion

1 will

of the distribution function. It is interesting to note that such distortions

could potentially mitigate the eﬀects of Landau damping, via local ﬂat-

tening of

at the resonant velocity (for β

1). Second, the gyroﬂuid

f

h

i

∼

26

model of this paper is the simplest possible. It is important to consider

full set of nonlinear gyroﬂuid equations to include gyro-viscosity, ﬁnite

Larmor radius corrections to the Reynolds stress, etc., which are relevant

for the case of oblique and near-perpendicular propagation.

As noted above, the kinetic eﬀects which govern the dynamics of a

collisionless plasma may signiﬁcantly alter the pictire of nonlinear Alfv´en

wave dynamics built upon the MHD plasma model. Inclusion of wave-

particle resonance eﬀects can signiﬁcantly alter predictions for modula-

tional instability (i.e.

left vs. right circular polarization dependence of

growth rate upon parameters such as Te/Ti, β, etc.). Also, the nonlocal
structure of the envelope equation which arises from the eﬀects of parallel

streaming, will likely result in departure from the traditional paradigm of

collisionless shocks as solitons formed by the competition between non-

linear steepening and dispersion. In particular, a new time scale, namely

the ion transit time through the envelope modulation, enters along with

the steepening and dispersion rates. Strong ion heating will occur, as

well. Thus, collisionless shock structure may be smoothed or exhibit sec-

ondary temporal oscillations. These speculations may be easily addressed

by studies of numerical solution of the (tractable) envelope equations de-

rived in this paper. The result of these numerical studies will be published

in Part II of this series.

Finally, it should be mentioned that an improved understanding of

nonlinear Alfv´en dynamics in a compressible plasma may have applica-

tion in contexts other than collisionless shocks in the solar wind plasma.

First, a signiﬁcant fraction of the interstellar medium [30] is hot, col-

lisionless compressible plasma. Thus, the problems of the galactic dy-

namo and interstellar turbulence should be approached in the context

of a collisionless, compressible plasma model. In particular, collisionless

dissipation via ion heating is a natural mechanism for controlling the

growth of small scale magnetic energy which has been shown to inhibit

the mean ﬁeld dynamo in purely incompressible MHD theories [31,32].

Similarly, the processes of wave steepening and shock or soliton forma-

tion can strongly aﬀect the parallel dynamics of Alfv´enic turbulence in

27

the interstellar medium. Such turbulence is thought to be related to

interstellar scintillations. These issues will be addressed in future publi-

cations.

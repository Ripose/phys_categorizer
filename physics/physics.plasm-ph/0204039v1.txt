We demonstrate ultrashort (6 ps), multi-Megagauss (27 MG) magnetic pulses generated upon
interaction of an intense laser pulse (1016 Wcm−2, 100 fs) with a solid target. The temporal
evolution of these giant ﬁelds generated near the high density critical layer is obtained with the
highest resolution reported so far. Particle-in-cell simulations and phenomenological modeling is
used to explain the results. The ﬁrst direct observations of anomalously rapid damping of plasma
shielding currents produced in response to the hot electron currents penetrating the bulk plasma
are presented.

The largest magnetic ﬁelds available terrestrially (∼
108 Gauss) are generated by explosive ionization of a solid
target with an intense ultrashort laser pulse [1]. Since
the ﬁrst observation of such magnetic ﬁelds, their origin,
magnitudes and other qualitative features have attracted
considerable attention [2]. Recently, sub-picosecond laser
produced solid plasmas have provided a new experimen-
tal facet to these studies. Magnetic ﬁelds up to gigagauss
magnitudes have been predicted in overdense region of
solid target [3]. Little, however, is known about the tem-
poral evolution of these huge magnetic ﬁelds generated
around critical layer. These ﬁelds play a crucial role in
electron transport [4] and are, therefore, important for
potential applications in hybrid conﬁnement [5] and fast
ignition [6] schemes of laser fusion.

In this Letter, we present ﬁrst experimental measure-
ments of temporal evolution of Megagauss magnetic ﬁelds
generated at the critical layer, on femtosecond timescales.
The ﬁeld generation and decay mechanisms are identiﬁed
and role of resonance absorption is examined. The initial
buildup of magnetic ﬁeld due to direct laser radiation ef-
fects is calculated using LPIC++ code [7] and the results
are found to be in good agreement with the experiment.
The ﬁeld evolution is explained to be due to currents
generated by fast electrons [8] and plasma return cur-
rents damped by turbulence induced resistivity [9]. The
ﬁrst direct observation of anomalously rapid damping of
return currents, which may have important consequences
for laser fusion, is reported. We demonstrate ultrashort,
Megagauss magnetic pulses, with 6 picosecond (FWHM)
duration and a peak magnitude of 27 Megagauss gener-
ated by a p-polarized laser pulse. Possible applications
of such high-ﬁeld ultrashort magnetic pulses in various
areas are discussed.

Laser pulses (806 nm, 100 fs) are derived from a cus-
tom built chirped pulse ampliﬁcation Titanium:Sapphire
laser, described in detail elsewhere [10]. The linearly po-
larized pump pulse incident at 55◦ is focused on a solid
target with typical intensities of 1016 W cm−2 (Fig. 1).
A small part of the laser is used to generate a linearly

polarized, second harmonic (403nm) probe pulse using a
thin (0.5mm) BBO crystal. The probe pulse incident at
50◦, is focused to an intensity of 5 × 1012 W cm−2 and
is spatially overlapped with the pump spot. The probe
penetrates beyond the critical density(nc) for pump (i.e.
upto 1.65n806
as shown in inset of Fig.1). The
probe pulse delay with respect to pump is varied using a
motorized translation stage.

The novel features of this experiment are: (a) we are
able to examine the generated magnetic ﬁeld on either
side of the critical layer by using the second harmonic of
the laser as a non-tangential probe, (b) we identify zero-
delay time precisely and obtain high-resolution data for
temporal evolution, and (c) we examine, using oblique
pump incidence, the role of Resonance Absorption (RA).
To our knowledge, only one laboratory has hitherto re-
ported [11] pump-probe magnetic ﬁelds measurements
on picosecond time scales (using
1 ps duration laser
pulse at normal incidence). However, these measure-
ments were conﬁned to an under-dense plasma region
(ne = 4 × 1019 cm−3) and the diagnostics employed lim-
ited the temporal resolution to ∼ 3 ps. We emphasize
our probing technique, because, magnetic ﬁeld genera-
tion primarily occurs near the critical surface (electron
density ∼ 1021cm−3), the region of maximum laser ab-
sorption [8]. Moreover, it is the magnetic ﬁeld in the
over-dense region that determines hot electron transport
into the bulk, which is crucial for fusion related issues.

We use standard Cotton-Mouton polarimetry [12],
which involves measurement of magnetically induced el-
lipticity in the polarization state of the probe pulse. The
contributions to induced ellipticity from plasma propa-
gation and refraction eﬀects [13] are calculated and are
found to be insigniﬁcant [14]. The targets used in these
experiments are optically polished aluminum discs. The
target is housed inside a vacuum chamber at 10−3 Torr
and is translated after each laser shot, exposing a fresh
surface for interaction. The pump and probe focussing is
monitored using hard x-ray emission as diagnostic. The
spot radii for pump and probe are 15µm and 10µm re-

spectively. The reﬂected probe beam is collected using
f/20 lens. The amplitude and polarization of the specu-
larly reﬂected probe is simultaneously monitored by split-
ting it into two arms, one measuring the reﬂectivity with
a photodiode (PD2) and the other measuring the polar-
ization state using an analyzer (extinction ratio 10−5) in
front of another identical photodiode (PD3), as shown in
Fig. 1. The photodiode PD1 measures the shot to shot
laser ﬂuctuations. All three PD signals are simultane-
ously recorded for each laser shot along with the delay
stage position. The ellipticity is determined at various
ﬁxed delay positions by plotting PD3 signal with respect
to analyzer angle. Higher temporal resolution elliptic-
ity data is obtained by continuously varying the delay
in steps of 1µm at diﬀerent ﬁxed analyzer positions and
computing the ratio PD3/PD2 for each delay. The ratio
(PD3/PD2) is used above so as to account for plasma
reﬂectivity variation as function of time delay. The tem-
poral behavior of the magnetic ﬁeld from -2 to +10 ps
time delay is monitored. The constant background noise
due to the second harmonic radiation from the plasma
generated by the pump pulse is negligible (< 0.1%) as
compared to the reﬂected probe.

netic ﬁeld. The inset shows reﬂectivity and induced ellip-
ticity of the probe for a p-polarized pump. The sharp re-
ﬂectivity dip is used to independently establish the start

tions using [12] β(t) = 3.32 × 10−26

where ‘ne’ is the electron density in cm−3, ‘B’ is mag-
netic ﬁeld in MG, and ‘l’ is the path length in µm. The
magnetic ﬁeld is deduced assuming a spatially uniform
B over a linear density gradient ne(x) = 0.4n403
(x/L),
where L is the plasma slab length, as shown in the inset
of ﬁg1. The factor 0.4n403
corresponds to the turning
point density for the 403nm probe. We integrate over
1 + y′2dx, where
the trajectory in the plasma, dl =
y′ = sinθ0/
ǫ(x) − sin2θ0 , ǫ(x) being the dielectric
function. The plasma expansion velocity is estimated
to be 5 × 107 cm/s from Doppler shift measurements of
the reﬂected probe. With L(t) = 1 + vexpt , the mag-
netic ﬁeld as a function of time delay is obtained as
B(t) = 80
β(t)/(1 + 0.5t) MG . From the results shown
in Fig. 2, the magnetic ﬁeld pulse generated p-polarized
pump has a peak value of 27 MG and duration (FWHM)
of 6ps. In comparison s-polarized pump results in a peak
value of 14 MG. This conﬁrms the importance of RA,
induced by p-polarization, in magnetic ﬁeld generation.
The magnetic ﬁeld in case of s-polarized pump can be
explained to be arising from parametric instabilities near
critical density, which develop at a slower rate as seen in
ﬁgure 2. Further, any realistic laser focusing always in-
volves some RA contribution even for s-polarization, due
to critical surface rippling and geometrical eﬀects [8, 15].

The mechanism of quasi-static magnetic ﬁeld genera-
tion in ultrashort laser -plasma experiments can be un-

(1)
Equation (1) is derived by taking the curl of the equa-
tion of motion of background plasma electrons that carry
the plasma shielding currents, ~jp = ~∇ × ~B − ~jhot . The
ﬁrst term in equation (1) is the standard electron mag-
netohydrodynamic (EMHD)[16] source due to the Hall
eﬀect, the second term is the thermoelectric source and
the third term is the source due to hot electrons (gen-
erated near the pump critical surface by the RA of the
laser pulse); the last term gives the magnetic ﬁeld decay
due to resistive damping of the plasma shielding currents
(σ−1 being the background plasma resistivity). Electron
inertia and magnetic ﬁeld convection eﬀects are assumed
to be negligible in equation (1).

We estimate the ﬁrst term (important during the ﬁrst
200 fs when the pump is on) by taking a cycle-averaged
product of high frequency current and magnetic ﬁelds
[17],~∇ × D( ~jh × ~Bh)/neeE, inside the plasma. We obtain
the magnitude of this term by carrying out a particle-
in-cell simulation using the laser-plasma interaction code
LPIC++.
In the simulation, a p-polarized light pulse
with sin2 envelope and 100 fs FWHM laser pulse is in-
cident at an angle of 55◦ on a linear density ramp. Fig.
3(a) shows numerically obtained spatial and temporal
proﬁles of the quasi-steady state magnetic ﬁeld. This
conﬁrms the earlier analytical results of spatial proﬁles
of laser generated magnetic ﬁelds [18]. At the same time,
the values of B and ∂B/∂t obtained from simulation
compare well with our experimental results (Fig. 3b).
The numerically obtained maximum value of ∂B/∂t is
22 MG/ps at 120 fs, which is close to the experimentally
deduced ∂B/∂t. The B value reached in 150 fs is 1.2 MG,
beyond which the simulation results saturate. This is ex-
pected, because to model this regime we have considered
only one term, which is valid strictly for the duration of
pulse.

The second term in equation (1) is estimated assum-
ing a temperature gradient of 100 eV over a transverse
scale of 15µm (pump spot radius) and density gradient of
1021 cm−3 over 1µm in the normal direction. This gives
∂B/∂t ∼ 0.05 MG/ps, which is much smaller than the
experimental results. Hence, the thermoelectric source
term is neglected in subsequent analysis.

The remaining terms (magnetic diﬀusion and hot elec-
tron source [8, 19] ) in the magnetic ﬁeld evolution equa-
tion govern the evolution of B after the pump pulse is
removed. We model this regime by a phenomenological
0-dimensional evolution equation

tation of the magnetic diﬀusion term. Taking S(t) =
S0exp(−t/t0), we get

B(t) =

[exp(−t/t0) − exp(−t/τ )],

The ﬁrst term in equation (3) denotes the natural decay
of the hot electron source produced by RA mechanism.
The second term describes the resistive decay of the ﬁelds
generated by the plasma return currents. As shown in
Fig. 2, this expression gives an excellent ﬁt to our ex-
perimental data for p -polarized pump with S0 = 53.7
MG/ps, t0 = 0.7 ps and τ = 5.6 ps.

To get an insight into these numerical values, we es-
timate conductivity σ from the magnetic diﬀusion term.
Using τ ∼ (4πσ/c2)(∆x)2, for the best ﬁt value τ = 5.6
ps and ∆x = 15µm , we get σ = 1.8 × 1014 sec−1. How-
ever the σsolid or σclassical observed [20] at Te = 100
eV has value of ≈ 4.5 × 1015 sec−1, which is an order
of magnitude greater than that obtained from magnetic
ﬁeld decay! This clearly brings out the importance of
turbulence induced anomalous resistivity eﬀects in the
damping of shielding plasma currents. An upper esti-
mate of anomalous resistivity due to turbulence of elec-
trostatic waves, obtained by taking the eﬀective collision
frequency νef f ∼ f ωp ( where f is a fraction of order
unity ), is in reasonable agreement with our estimate of
σ. We note that the hot electron source term is eﬀec-
tive for about 0.7 ps, which is longer than the laser pulse
(FWHM=100fs). Thus we argue that the electrostatic
plasma waves generated by the RA mechanism (typically

with E2/4πneTe ≫ 1 ) during the laser pulse will con-
tinue to slowly damp (or convect away) and accelerate
electrons for a few hundred femtoseconds after the laser
pulse. To get an estimate of S0, which is the magni-
tude of the source term | (c/σ)(~∇ × ~jhot) | , we evaluate
jhot ≈ faeI/Thot by taking a conversion fraction (fa) of
incident energy into hot electrons as 0.3 and Thot ∼ 20
keV (estimated by using the well known scaling laws for
resonance absorption [21]). This yields hot electron cur-
rent density jhot ∼ 4.5 × 1020 statampere/cm2. Using
anomalous conductivity obtained above we get S0 ∼ 61
MG/ps, which is again in close agreement with our phe-
nomenological ﬁt.

In conclusion, we have measured and characterized pi-
cosecond megagauss magnetic pulses generated by the in-
teraction of ultrashort laser pulse with a solid. Our mea-
surements extend to overdense region of the target and
hence are of relevance to electron transport and fusion
related issues. The experimentally observed rise times
and magnitude of magnetic ﬁelds closely follow theoret-
ical estimates and simulations. We also observe for the
ﬁrst time, anomalously rapid damping of return plasma
shielding currents produced in response to the hot elec-
tron currents penetrating the bulk plasma; this is a topic
of great signiﬁcance to the fast ignition scheme. Such
ultrashort,
localized magnetic ﬁelds are useful for in-
vestigating magnetic precession and reversal dynamics,
which is vital for developing next generation ultrafast
switching and storage devices [22]. Further, the genera-
tion and characterization of these giant magnetic ﬁelds
oﬀers a unique opportunity for accessing extreme stellar
conditions and testing astrophysical theories in the lab-
oratory [23]. The diagnostics in chemical and biological
sciences like Magnetic Circular Dichroism and Magnetic
Resonance may also beneﬁt in situations where high ﬁelds
are essential [24]. The intensities used in our experiments
are easily realizable with modern kilohertz repetition rate
femtosecond lasers, and we foresee exciting applications
for these magnetic pulses.

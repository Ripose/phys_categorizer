Stimulated Raman backscattering (RBS) of intense laser radiation conﬁned by a single-mode
plasma channel with a radial variation of plasma frequency greater than a homogeneous-plasma
RBS bandwidth is characterized by a strong transverse localization of resonantly-driven electron
plasma waves (EPW). The EPW localization reduces the peak growth rate of RBS and increases the
ampliﬁcation bandwidth. The continuum of non-bound modes of backscattered radiation shrinks the
transverse ﬁeld proﬁle in a channel and increases the RBS growth rate. Solution of the initial-value
problem shows that an electromagnetic pulse ampliﬁed by the RBS in the single-mode deep plasma
channel has a group velocity higher than in the case of homogeneous-plasma Raman ampliﬁcation.
Implications to the design of an RBS pulse compressor in a plasma channel are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Stimulated Raman backscattering (RBS) of laser radi-
ation in plasmas [1] is a parametric process in which a
laser beam (pump wave) is backscattered oﬀ the electron
plasma density ﬂuctuations. These density perturbations
are driven and ampliﬁed by the ponderomotive beatwave
of pump and scattered electromagnetic (EM) waves. Un-
der certain phase matching conditions a positive feedback
loop develops that results in the onset of a temporal or
spatio-temporal instability [2]. The RBS in transversely
homogeneous plasmas has been extensively studied since
early 1970s [1, 2], when it ﬁrst came to the fore in the
context of fast electron generation and target pre-heat
in laser conﬁnement fusion. The basic treatment of the
RBS in homogeneous plasmas is now a classic that can
be found in a number of textbooks [3].

Although RBS of long laser beams has been stud-
ied for at least three decades, the short-pulse regimes
of this instability have only recently attracted atten-
tion due to the advances in generation and ampliﬁca-
tion of sub-picosecond multi-terawatt laser pulses [4].
The RBS of such pulses in rareﬁed homogeneous plas-
ω0, where ω0 is a fundamental frequency of
mas (ωp ≪
4πe2n0/me is an electron Langmiur plasma
laser, ωp =

is an electron charge, and n0 is an elec-

tron plasma density) was explored in detail in both ex-
periment [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and theory [11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17]. The recent upsurge of interest in the RBS
has been speciﬁcally caused by theoretical discovery of
the possibility to amplify and compress ultra-short laser
pulses in a plasma by backscattering a long low-intensity
counter-propagating laser beam [18, 19, 20].

tion [23, 24] in tenuous plasmas, beneﬁt from a long in-
teraction distance. In a homogeneous plasma the region
of high intensity interaction is conﬁned to approximately
one Rayleigh diﬀraction length ZR = k0r2
0/2, where k0 is
a wavenumber, and r0 is a radius of a focal spot of a laser
beam. Propagation over longer distances requires some
form of laser guiding. Guiding by a plasma channel is the
most promising experimental approach [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]
for high laser intensities. Excitation of relativistic plasma
waves in channels was analyzed [30, 31, 32, 33] for parti-
cle acceleration.

The guided laser pulses are not immune to paramet-
ric instabilities, such as forward and near-forward stim-
ulated Raman scattering (SRS) in parabolic [16, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39], tapered [40], leaky [41], and single-mode
ﬂat channels [42], or large-angle SRS in plasma-ﬁlled
capillaries [43]. Commonly, the energy losses of a laser
pulse and excessive plasma heating due to the large-angle
SRS (including RBS) are undesirable for some applica-
tions [44], and uncovering new physical mechanisms that
enable the RBS suppression is up to date. For some ap-
plications, however, the RBS can be useful. E.g., the
laser pulse leading front depletion by the RBS may seed
either forward SRS or resonant modulational instabil-
ity [15, 45]. Novel schemes of short-pulse ampliﬁcation in
a plasma [18, 19] are based on the backscattering of a long
moderately intense pump laser beam into a short counter-
propagating signal pulse: the energy of the pump is ab-
sorbed by the signal as it is ampliﬁed and compressed.
The Raman compression could be a viable path to ob-
taining high-power single-cycle pulses. For transversely
homogeneous plasmas, one of the challenges of Raman
ampliﬁcation is to ensure the uniformity of plasma along
the interaction axis so that the signal be downshifted
from the pump by almost exactly the plasma frequency
ωp. In the present paper we discover novel features of the
RBS in plasma channels, which are favorable for realiza-
tion of Raman ampliﬁcation (to anticipate, the RBS pro-
cess in a deep plasma channel can be broadband enough
to make exact resonant detuning of pump and signal un-

necessary).

To enable analytic progress and to facilitate qualitative
understanding, we focus on plasma channels that support
a single conﬁned hf EM mode, referred to as a fundamen-
tal mode of channel (FMC). The laser pulse conﬁned in a
channel is assumed to be the FMC. The RBS in a single-
mode channel proceeds diﬀerently than in a homogeneous
plasma and can be characterized by the following novel
features: (a) reduction of the RBS peak temporal growth
rate; (b) broadening of the RBS ampliﬁcation bandwidth;
(c) modiﬁcation of the transverse proﬁle of the scattered
mode from that of FMC. Depending on the parameters
of channel (such as on-axis plasma density and density
depression) and pump laser (such as frequency and in-
tensity), those modiﬁcations can be either more or less
prominent.

It was suggested earlier [42] in the context of Raman
forward scattering (RFS) that plasma frequency varia-
tion across the channel may signiﬁcantly reduce the peak
growth rate. The eﬀect is resulted from a strong lo-
calization of a scattering electron plasma wave (EPW)
near the channel axis. However, due to the compli-
cated hybrid EM nature of a relativistic EPW in a chan-
nel [30, 31, 32, 33], only approximate results were ob-
tained in 42. Speciﬁcally, it was assumed that the scat-
tered radiation was in the fundamental channel mode.
For the RBS, the EM component of the short-wavelength
EPW may be neglected, enabling us to account for the
transverse proﬁle modiﬁcation of the backscattered radi-
ation. This is accomplished by expanding the transverse
proﬁle of the scattered ﬁeld into the channel eigenmodes,
i.e., the FMC plus continuum of the non-bound hf EM
modes. These continuum modes of channel (CMC) do
not exponentially decay outside of the channel (as the
FMC does) and exhibit a cosine-like behavior at inﬁnity,
which makes them similar to the transverse Fourier har-
monics of scattered radiation in a homogeneous plasma.
The problem is complicated by the fact that the FMC
and CMC are not independent. Radial shear of the
plasma density couples them to each other not only cre-
ating the ﬁeld structure diﬀerent from that of FMC but
also aﬀecting spectral features of the instability. One of
our goals is to evaluate the continuum-mode contribu-
tion to the RBS growth rate. We put emphasis on the
regime of strong plasma wave localization (SPWL). Spec-
tral features of this regime are markedly diﬀerent from
those of the homogeneous-plasma RBS. The SPWL oc-
curs when the parameter η = (∆ωp/ωp1)2/(2γhom/ωp1)

tude of electric ﬁeld of the pump wave
, which physically

means that the plasma frequency depression in a channel
exceeds the RBS bandwidth in a homogeneous plasma.
In the SPWL regime, the maximum temporal increment
is shown to scale as γhom/ 3√η. Hence, plasma wave lo-

{

calization suppresses the instability. On the other hand,
the transverse shear of the plasma frequency results in
a broader instability bandwidth. Spectral maximum of
the backscattered light is found to be red-shifted from the
pump frequency by more than ωp1, and the spectrum it-
self extends on the red side far beyond the frequency
bandwidth of the homogeneous-plasma RBS. The band-
width increase is due to the backscattering oﬀ the channel
regions with higher local plasma frequencies and, there-
fore, higher red-shifts of scattered light. In the SPWL
regime, the CMC contribution transversely shrinks the
fastest-growing mode of scattered radiation and concen-
trates the scattered ﬁeld near the channel axis. This
eﬀect is followed by enhancement of the RBS (in the nu-
merical examples presented in the paper, the continuum
modes add from 25% to 50% to the peak value of tem-
poral increment).

The CMC contribution to the RBS process may be
neglected if the pump amplitude is suﬃciently small
(or the channel is deep) to satisfy the inequality u0 ≪
(∆ωp/ωp1)2/ (ω0/ωp1)5/4. This regime is referred to as
single-mode, because the scattered ﬁeld is fairly well rep-
resented solely by FMC. That only three unstable waves
(two bound EM modes and a localized EPW) participate
the single-mode RBS makes it the channel analog of the
three-wave (i.e., weakly coupled) RBS in a homogeneous
plasma despite the vast diﬀerence in spectral features. In
the single-mode regime an analytic solution of the initial-
value problem has been found, which describes the evo-
lution of the single-mode backscattered EM signal in the
ﬁeld of a single-mode pump. It is shown that the max-
imum of the wave packet moves with the velocity 2c/3,
which is higher than a group velocity of radiation c/2 of
the weakly coupled RBS in a homogeneous plasma. High
group velocity of the ampliﬁed pulse and its broad band-
width produced by the transverse shear of plasma density
proﬁtably distinguish the single-mode Raman ampliﬁca-
tion in a plasma channel from its homogeneous-plasma
counterpart [19].

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the single-
mode planar plasma channel is introduced, and basic
equations governing the nonlinear plasma response to
the combined pump and scattered radiation are derived.
These equations are solved in Sec. III by the mode expan-
sion, and the generalized dispersion relation is derived.
This dispersion relation allows for the coupling between
the FMC and CMC of scattered radiation. In Sec. IV,
the dispersion equation is solved in the most interesting
and novel regime of SPWL. The criterium which allows
to neglect the CMC contribution to the RBS process is
proposed. The spectral bandwidth and peak temporal
growth rate of the single-mode regime are derived.
In
Sec. V the initial value problem describing the linear evo-
lution of the EM signal is formulated and solved, and the
group velocity of the signal is evaluated. Summary of the
results is given in Sec. VI. The Appendix reviews some
properties of the associated Legendre functions with an
imaginary order which describe the continuous spectrum

of the EM channel eigenmodes.

regime admits an analogy with the three-wave RBS in
a homogeneous plasma (these processes, however, have
quite diﬀerent spectral properties). Eq. (24) yields the

The larger u0, the stronger the instability is driven, and
the larger is the population of CMC excited. When u0
falls within the interval

RBS process becomes essentially multi-mode. The RHS
of Eq. (23) cannot be omitted then, and the dispersion
equation (23) is solved numerically.

curves obtained for the RBS in both single- and multi-
mode SPWL regimes. For the ﬁxed values of normalized
laser frequency ¯ω0 = 10 and amplitude of electric ﬁeld

and (3) demonstrates considerable enhancement of RBS
due to the CMC contribution: the CMC correction to
the peak increment amounts to about 25%. The basic
characteristics of RBS in the multi-mode SPWL regime
can be summarized as follows:

1. The peak growth rate is reduced if compared with

the case of homogeneous plasma.

2. Contribution from the CMC enhances the scatter-

ing process.

3. The RBS bandwidth inside a channel is signiﬁ-

cantly larger than in a homogeneous plasma.

4. The frequency spectrum experiences overall red-

shift from the Stokes frequency ω0 −

ωp1.

The last two features are clear advantages of the SPWL
regime for the Raman ampliﬁcation of short pulses in
plasmas [19]. Due to the broadband nature of the pro-
ωp1 is
cess, exact tuning the signal frequency to ω0 −
not necessary to get a considerable ampliﬁcation rate in
the linear regime. We can also estimate here the RBS
growth rate modiﬁcation for the parameters typical of
a channel-guided laser driven accelerator. The plasma
channel created in the experiment [29] was capable of
single-mode guiding of the laser pulse with a radius 8µm
2 in intensity, which under ansatz (4) gives
at the level e−

axis surrounded by the walls which are few laser wave-
lengths thick and approximately twice the bottom den-

sume that the main contribution to the guiding eﬀect is
made from the near-axis density proﬁle which admits the

increment can be expected in comparison with the case
of homogeneous plasma, and the contribution from CMC
to the peak increment amounts to 30% of γhom.

SPATIO-TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF

BACKSCATTERED PULSE IN THE
SINGLE-MODE SPWL REGIME

A. Group velocity of scattered radiation

In this Section we address the linear Raman ampliﬁ-
cation of EM wave packet in a plasma channel. First,
we evaluate the group velocity of backscattered light,
c(∂Re ¯ω/∂¯k) at ∂Im ¯ω/∂¯k = 0. By deﬁnition,
i.e., vg ≡
thus calculated group velocity determines the speed of
the pulse peak. On substituting ¯ω = Ω + iγ with Ω and
γ real into the dispersion relation (24), we separate real
and imaginary parts of the equation, exclude γ, and ob-
tain the algebraic relation which deﬁnes implicitly the
dispersion function Ω(¯k):

¯k2 + 4¯kΩ + 3Ω2

Ω3 + 2¯kΩ2 + ¯k2Ω + b
3Ω + 2¯k

(28)

Diﬀerentiating Eq. (28) with respect to ¯k, and plugging
into the resulting equation ¯k = 0 and Ω(0) = Re ¯ω from
Eq. (25) (i.e., the wave number and real part of frequency
corresponding to the peak growth rate), we ﬁnd the group
velocity vg =
2c/3 (the minus sign means that the am-
pliﬁed pulse moves in the backward direction).

VI. CONCLUSION

We have investigated the RBS of laser radiation in
the regime of strong plasma wave localization (SPWL)
in a plane plasma channel, which can support only one
trapped EM mode (the single-mode channel [42]). For
the SPWL regime, transverse variation of the plasma fre-
quency exceeds the RBS bandwidth calculated for a ho-
mogeneous plasma with an on-axis electron density, and
the scattering plasma wave is localized stronger than a
driving beatwave of pump and scattered radiation.
In
this case, the transverse proﬁle of the scattered radia-

of channel (CMC). Depending on the plasma and laser
parameters, the RBS with SPWL can proceed either in
a single- or multi-mode regime. In the single-mode case,
excitation of the CMC is suppressed almost completely,
and only the FMC of scattered radiation is involved in
the process. This allows for a physical analogy between
the single-mode SPWL regime of RBS in a plasma chan-
nel and a three-wave RBS in a homogeneous plasma. In
the multi-mode SPWL regime, the CMC play an essen-
tial role. The CMC contribution transversely shrinks the
scattered radiation beam, and increases the growth rate
of the instability. Spectral features of both sub-regimes
are qualitatively similar. The temporal growth rate is
slower, and ampliﬁcation bandwidth is greater than in
the case of homogeneous plasma, and the frequency spec-
trum experiences an overall red-shift. The group velocity
2c/3, is increased versus
of scattered radiation, vg ≈ −
its homogeneous-plasma value, vg hom =
c/2. All these
features are the consequences of the transverse shear of
the electron plasma density. The broadband nature of
RBS in the SPWL regime and relatively high group ve-
locity of scattered radiation are the features proﬁtable for
the Raman ampliﬁcation of short pulses in deep plasma
channels.

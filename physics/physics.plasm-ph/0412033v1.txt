We present a semi-analytical free-energy model aimed at characterizing the thermodynamic prop-
erties of dense ﬂuid helium, from the low-density atomic phase to the high-density fully ionized
regime. The model is based on a free-energy minimization method and includes various diﬀerent
contributions representative of the correlations between atomic and ionic species and electrons. This
model allows the computation of the thermodynamic properties of dense helium over an extended
range of density and temperature and leads to the computation of the phase diagram of dense ﬂuid
helium, with its various temperature and pressure ionization contours. One of the predictions of
the model is that pressure ionization occurs abruptly at ρ ∼> 10 g cm−3, i.e. P ∼> 20 Mbar, from
atomic helium He to fully ionized helium He2+, or at least to a strongly ionized state, without He+
stage, except at high enough temperature for temperature ionization to become dominant. These
predictions and this phase diagram provide a guide for future dynamical experiments or numeri-
cal ﬁrst-principle calculations aimed at studying the properties of helium at very high density, in
particular its metallization.
Indeed, the characterization of the helium phase diagram bears im-
portant consequences for the thermodynamic, magnetic and transport properties of cool and dense
astrophysical objects, among which the solar and the numerous recently discovered extrasolar giant
planets.

INTRODUCTION

Within the past decade, over a hundred brown dwarfs, astrophysical bodies not dense enough to sustain hydrogen
fusion in their core, and extrasolar giant planets, i.e.
jovian planets orbiting stars outside the solar system, have
been discovered. These objects are composed essentially of hydrogen and helium. Given their large gravity and
relatively low temperature, within astrophysical standards, the hydrogen and heluim ﬂuid is under an atomic or
molecular form in the outermost part of the body and under the form of a fully ionized electron-ion plasma in the
innermost regions. Such an internal structure is common to many so-called compact objects, from our own jovian
planets to the external layers of white dwarfs or neutron stars. The characterization of the structure and cooling
properties of these compact objects thus requires the knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen
and helium ﬂuids, and more importantly a realistic description of the partial, pressure ionization regime. Given
the large variations of thermodynamic conditions characteristic of the structure and evolution of such astrophysical
bodies, these thermodynamic properties, characterized by the equation of state (EOS), must be calculated over several
orders of magnitudes in density and temperature. As discussed below, the necessity to calculate the thermodynamic
properties over such a large range of conditions precludes the use of heavy computer simulations and thus necessitates
the derivation of EOS models which allow extensive calculations within a reasonable amount of computer time,
unfortunately at the price of a more approximate, or say phenomenological description of the properties of matter at
high-density.

Interestingly enough, these EOS of dense matter under astrophysical conditions can now be probed on Earth by
shock wave experiments. Future large laser experiments, like e.g. the NIF project at Livermore or the LMJ project
in France, will reach conditions characteristic of the deep interior of the aforementioned astrophysical bodies. So
not only the calculation of dense matter EOS is of interest for astrophysical applications, but it is necessary for the
confrontation of theory with existing and future high-pressure experiments, yielding eventually a correct knowledge
of the properties of matter under extreme conditions. Hydrogen, the most common element in the universe, has been
studied extensively, both on the experimental and theoretical fronts, and the EOS of dense hydrogen becomes more
and more constrained, although the very regime of pressure ionization still remains ill-determined. The same cannot

be said for helium. Although some experiments exist in the regime of neutral helium at high-density, as detailed below,
the regime of helium pressure ionization, from He to He+ and He2+ remains for now unexplored, and no attempt has
been made to give a detailed theoretical description of these domains. It is the very purpose of the present paper
to derive an EOS for dense, partially ionized helium, covering the gap between the previous study of dense neutral
helium [1] and the fully ionized regime [2] [3]. As mentioned above, not only the calculation of such a dense helium
EOS is necessary for a description of the thermodynamic properties of astrophysical compact objects, in particular
the recently discovered gaseous exoplanets, but it provides a useful guide for future high-pressure shock-wave or laser
experiments.

The paper is organised as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy comment on the general formalism underlying the present
calculations. The various contributions entering our general model free-energy are presented in detail in Sec. III.
The results, and the limitations of the model are presented in Sec. IV. Special attention is devoted to the impact of
various approximations in the free-energy calculation on the ﬁnal results. Section V is devoted to the conclusion.

II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

A. Chemical picture of a dense plasma

Equation-of-state calculations can be divided into two generic categories. The “physical approach” is formally
exact as it involves only fundamental particles, electrons and nuclei, interacting through the Coulomb potential. The
partition function is calculated using the eigenvalues corresponding to this N -body system. In practice, however,
the exact solution cannot be calculated, in particular when bound-states form, and either perturbative expansions
or approximate numerical schemes must be used. The validity of the expansions is limited to high temperatures
and/or low-densities, i.e. apply to weakly or moderately coupled plasmas. The regime of pressure ionization thus
cannot be described by such expansion schemes. Numerical technics, such as density functional theory, molecular
dynamics or path-integral Monte Carlo simulations, do extend to the strongly correlated regime but the description
of the pressure ionization regime then becomes a formidable task, and involves also physical approximations in the
calculations of either the electron functional or the nodal functions, not mentioning the ﬁnite size eﬀects due to
In practice, these simulations do not allow the calculation of
the limited number of particles in the simulation.
thermodynamic quantities over a large range of temperatures and densities, as needed for practical applications,
as mentioned earlier. For this reason, a more phenomenological approach has been developped which combines a
simpliﬁed description of the properties of dense matter and a semi-analytical derivation, allowing the calculations of
extended thermodynamic tables with moderate computer time investment. This is the so-called “chemical picture”.
In this approach, the basic particles are no longer only electrons and nuclei but also bound species (atoms, molecules,
ions), which are characterized by their interparticle potentials. That means that the particles remain distinguishable
(in a classical sense) in the plasma, with their own identities and interaction properties. The problem thus reduces to
the free-energy minimization of a multi-component system, taking into account chemical and ionization equilibrium
between the various species. Although certainly of doubtful validity in the regime of pressure ionization, where the
concepts of pair potential and bound-states become meaningless, this approach has been shown to yield reasonably
accurate descriptions of hydrogen at high density [4] [5]. Moreover, as mentioned above, this approach presents the
advantage of being semi-analytical and thus has a precious practical interest for EOS calculations. Last but not
least, the chemical approach oﬀers the noticeable advantage of clearly identifying the terms and the approximations
aimed at describing various physical eﬀects. Such terms can be added or removed with limited eﬀort, allowing a rapid
identiﬁcation of the dominant contributions responsible for the thermodynamic properties of matter under complex
conditions. Therefore, despite its shortcomings, the chemical approach should be seen as a useful alternative to the
“exact” physical approach.

B. General free-energy model

The chemical approach is based on the minimization of the free-energy F (
{

, T, V ) corresponding to a system
containing
δNi = 0 must
satisfy the electroneutrality condition and the stœchiometric conditions corresponding in our case to the following set
of chemical equations:

can be split into the sum of translational, conﬁgurational and internal contributions [6]

The conditions of validity of such a separability are:

the discretization of the eigenvalues corresponding to the translation degrees of freedom and to the center-of-mass
positions are negligible. This is the quasi-classic approximation;

there is no coupling between the translation degrees of freedom and the center-of-mass positions;

the internal energy levels remain essentially unperturbed by the interactions with surrounding particles.

•

•

•

If the two ﬁrst conditions are satisﬁed in the present context, the last one certainly becomes invalid in the pressure
ionization regime. We expect this regime, however, to cover a limited range of density, as pressure ionization generally
occurs rather abruptly. Eventually, only comparison with experimental data can give a quantitative estimate of the
discrepancy due to this underlying factorization condition. The various contributions to F are described in the next
section.

We ﬁrst present the models used to calculate the contributions to the total free-energy arising from each diﬀerent

species, He, He+, He2+. Then, we describe the modelization of the coupling between these various species.

2. The conﬁgurational free-energy Fconf

The conﬁgurational free-energy Fconf , arising from the interactions between helium atoms, is calculated within the
Weeks-Chandler-Andersen [9] [10] (WCA) perturbation theory. The interaction potential Φ(r) is split into a reference
potential Φref (r) and a perturbative part Φpert(r). Truncating the perturbative expansion of the free-energy after the
ﬁrst order, the so-called high-temperature approximation (HTA), yields:

Fconf = Fref (T, V, N ) +

dr Φpert(r)gref (r, V, N ).

The problem is thus reduced to the potential separation and to the calculation of Fref (T, V, N ) and gref (r, V, N ).

The two parameters C and D are optimized to reproduce the experimental measures of adiabatic sound velocity
[17]. A χ2 minimization yields (C, D) = (0.44, 0.8 cm3/g). This potential is illustrated in Fig. 2 whereas Fig. 3
compares the measured sound velocity and the one calculated with our potential. Fig. 4 compares the Hugoniot
curves obtained with the present atomic helium free-energy model and interatomic potential with presently available
shock-wave experiments [18]. These comparisons assess the validity of the present model at least up to the limit of
the data, i.e. P

The divergence of the internal partition function,

El/kBT ), of an isolated atom is a well-known problem
l gl exp(
in statistical physics. It emphasises the necessity to take into account the interactions between atoms in the calculation
βFint). For a density n, each atom has a typical available volume n−1/3
of the internal partition function,
so that, as density increases, the levels associated with the highest eigenvalues will move into the continuum. When
the density is high enough to disturb even the ground-state, the electrons can no longer remain bound to the nuclei:
this is the pressure ionization phenomenon. We have included the eﬀect of the interactions of surrounding particles on
the internal partition function of helium within the so-called occupation probability formalism [19] (OPF). The OPF
ensures the statistical-mechanical consistency between the conﬁgurational free-energy characterizing the interactions
between atoms, Fconf , and the internal free-energy contribution, Fint. The OPF has been extensively presented in
various papers (see e.g. [20]), and is only brieﬂy outlined for completeness. We consider a system of interacting
Zint + f , where f is the non-ideal term. Within the OPF, the total

The exact solution, in principle, requires the knowledge of all the interaction potentials between an atom in state α
and an other one in state α′. In the absence of such information, we have adopted the simplest approach which consists
to characterize excited state interactions by hard-sphere excluded volumes in the phase space. The hard-sphere radii
are calculated with the scaling law derived by Aparicio & Chabrier [1] (Eq. (14a) and (14b)). Within the ﬁrst order
in the expansion of the non-ideal part f of the free-energy (Eq. 4), the ωHS
α for the excited states are thus given by:

This nonlinear equation is solved iteratively by using results obtained within the low excitation approximation (LEA)

B. Model for the partially ionized plasma {He+, e−}

Because of the presence of bound-states, the treatment of He+ presents the same diﬃculties as for He. We adopt the
same formalism, namely the WCA perturbation expansion, to calculate the He+ conﬁgurational free-energy (with the
hard-sphere model as the reference system) and the OPF to treat the internal partition function. For the long-range
interaction potential between He+ ions, we take a Yukawa potential, e−ksr/r, where the density- and temperature-
dependent screening wave vector is given by [26]:

ks(n, T ) =

kTF[θ1/2F−1/2(µ/kBT )]1/2,

1
√2

where kTF = (4mee2/π~2)1/2(3π2ne)1/6 is the Thomas-Fermi screening wave vector, ne is the total free electron
density, θ = T /TF is the electronic degeneracy parameter (TF is the electron Fermi temperature), Fn is the Fermi
integral of order n, and µ/kBT is the electron chemical potential deﬁned by F1/2(µ/kBT ) = 2θ−3/2/3.
For the treatment of the internal free-energy, we need a scaling law to associate a hard-sphere radius to the excited
states of He+. Since He+ is hydrogen-like, and the energy levels are degenerate toward the orbital quantum number
l, we write this scaling law as:

σn = n2σ1,

where σ1 is the WCA hard-sphere radius associated to the ground-state, and n is the main quantum number.
The calculations then proceed exactly as in Sec. III A.

C. Model for the fully ionized plasma {He2+, e−}

The free-energy of a fully ionized electron-ion plasma (FIP) has been calculated by Chabrier & Pothekin [2] and
Potekhin & Chabrier [3]. These authors provide analytical parametrizations for the various thermodynamic quantities.
We refer the reader to these papers for a description of the fully ionized plasma model.

D.

Interactions between diﬀerent species

Besides all the aforedescribed contributions to the free-energy, arising from interactions between species of same

nature, we must also include contributions arising from the interactions between species of diﬀerent nature.

1. Hard-sphere interactions between atoms and ions

,

{

}

NHe,α, NHe+,α, NHe2+

The ﬁrst order interaction between the atomic and ionic species He, He+ and He2+ is the hard-sphere excluded
0 for the He2+
volume interaction, FHS(
σHe,α, σHe+,α, σHe2+
{
ions, calculated consistently from the hard-sphere free-energy of a multicomponent interacting system [13]. It can
be shown easily that the contribution arising from the σHe2+ = 0 component is equivalent to renormalizing the
ideal (kinetic) term for this species with a volume V ′ = (1
i /6 corresponds to the
total packing fraction [4]. This term thus takes into account the He-He, He+-He+, He-He+, He-He2+ and He+-He2+
interactions. Note that, contrarily to previous approaches, we do not consider excluded volume interactions between
bound species and free electrons. Indeed, such an approach does not seem to be justiﬁed, for the quantum exclusion
principle applies only to electrons in the same state. The entire volume of the system is thus available to the majority

from those corresponding to the bound-states. In any event, we have checked that the introduction of an excluded

Induced interactions between atoms and ions

The presence of charges in the neighbourhood of species with bound-states has two consequences. The ﬁrst one is
the induced polarization due to the electronic cloud, which translates into a related contribution to the free-energy.
The second one is the induced Stark eﬀect on the bound-states, due to the ambient electric ﬁeld which modiﬁes
the one associated to the atom nucleus. These two eﬀects have been taken into account in our model as described below.

The polarization contribution to the free-energy arising from the interactions between the charges and the neutral

atoms He has been handled as in previous N -body approaches [27] [4]:

Stark eﬀect on the bound-states, arising from the electric microﬁeld E due to the surrounding charges, is also
treated within the framework of the OPF. The occupation probability associated with the Stark interaction on the

We have directly applied their prescription to He+, and used the similarity between a He atom and a hydrogen-like
system, with a central charge equal to 7/4 for the ground-state and 1 for the 1snl -type levels [1], to calculate the
critical ﬁelds corresponding to atomic helium He.

3. Long range interaction between He+ and He2+

The remaining coupling contribution between the various species stems from the long range Coulomb interaction
between helium ions He+, He2+ and electrons. Short distance interactions due to the internal levels of He+ have
been considered in the previous sections. The treatment of the long range Coulomb interaction between the two ionic
species will certainly have some impact in the pressure ionization regime where He+ and He2+ coexist, but will not
modify the rest of the phase diagram. This contribution, however, is diﬃcult to evaluate accurately. Considering the
He+-He2+ interaction as a pure Coulomb contribution, thus representing the He+-He2+ ﬂuid as an interacting two-
component Z1 = 1, Z2 = 2 point-charge plasma is not satisfactory, for it precludes a correct treatment of the internal
levels of He+, which has been included in our formalism (see previous section). In this context, and in the absence
of an accurate formulation, we estimate the contribution to the total free-energy arising from the He+, He2+, e− long
range interaction in the framework of the ion-sphere model [29], thus considering only the electrostatic contribution
to the free-energy. In this very simpliﬁed model, the interaction between He+ and He2+ gives a contribution equal to

6
Z1Z2e2/a per pair, with Z1 = 1 and Z2 = 2, whereas the contribution due to the interaction between the central ion
He+ and the uniformly charged sphere
3/2(Z1e)2/a per He+. The He2+-e− and e−-e−
Z1e gives a contribution
contributions are already included in the FIP model mentioned in Sec. III C. The contribution thus reads:

.

The very crude treatment of this interaction between He+, He2+ and electrons is certainly a major shortcomings
of the present model and Eq. 19 gives at best an order of magnitude of the contribution of this interaction to the
free-energy. As mentioned above, there is no satisfactory description of ions with bound-states, He+ in the present
context, immersed in a surrounding dense plasma. Indeed, it is diﬃcult to capture the drastically diﬀerent nature of
the short-range and long-range interactions of such species with surrounding charged particles. This is undoubtedly
a limitation of the chemical picture, and of the related distinction between diﬀerent entities. In reality, the concept
of identifying He+ or He2+ particles, based on a concept of potential or pseudopotential, becomes meaningless at
high density. Only at high temperature, when kinetic contributions dominate, is the approach conceptually correct.
Therefore, although He+ or He2+ are distinguishable in our model free-energy, we do not pretend to give an accurate
description of the second stage of helium pressure ionization, from He+ to He2+. As detailed in the next section,
however, we have checked that the present, crude description of the He+-He2+ interactions does not alter the ﬁnal
phase diagram. The reason is that, at least in the present model, helium pressure ionization proceeds directly from
atomic helium He to fully ionized helium He2+, or at least to a strongly ionized stage. It will certainly be interesting
to compare these results with experiments and with results obtained with ﬁrst-principle calculations, although these
latter will certainly have to face their own diﬃculties in this complex regime.

Convergence of this two-dimensional minimization is achieved when the change in the populations from one iteration
to the next one is less than one part in 3 10−7. The various thermodynamic quantities are then calculated from
appropriate derivations of the free-energy.

IV. RESULTS

As mentioned previously, our free-energy model, with the He-He potential calibrated on sound velocity measure-
ments [17], reproduces the available Hugoniot experiments [18] (see Fig. 4). We have also checked that we recover
the results of the Saha equations in the low-density limit and, by construction, the fully ionized plasma model at high
density. An example is shown in Fig. 5 for T = 104.7 K. The vanishing fraction of bound species populations for

We have also checked that we recover the results of Aparicio & Chabrier [1] for pure atomic helium in the low-density,

A. Limitations of the model

As mentioned earlier, our free-energy minimization method is rooted in the chemical approach. It is based on a
heuristic treatment of the dominant physical eﬀects responsible for the thermodynamic properties of dense atomic
or ionized helium. Although it certainly retains some degree of reality, this model cannot pretend giving an exact
description of these properties, and the results should depend to some extent on the main approximations used in the
model. We examine this issue in the present section.

FIG. 6: Comparison between the present model (solid lines) and the results of Aparicio & Chabrier [1] (dotted lines with
symbols), which do not include pressure ionization, for the pressure, the massic entropy, the massic internal energy and the
speciﬁc heat at T=103.5 K.

1. Lower boundary for σ1

At very high density, the WCA radii tend eventually to zero, as shown in Fig. 1. This favors the He and He+
species and thus prevent pressure ionization to occur, a well identiﬁed artifact of the chemical picture [4] [30]. In
order to prevent such an unphysical behaviour, we deﬁne arbitrarily a lower limit for σHe and σHe+ . Fig. 7 (for the
104.7 K isotherm) illustrates the eﬀect of this approximation for σ1 ≥
Not surprisingly, the choice of a lower limit for σ1 aﬀects appreciably the populations in the very regime of pressure
ionization. However the eﬀect is almost inconsequential on the thermodynamic quantities, the very purpose of the
present calculations. This stems from the fact that the bound-species do not contribute to the free-energy when they
are associated with a very small radius. The ﬁnal model calculations were made with σ1 = 0.8 ˚A.

0.8 ˚A and σ1 ≥

0.5 ˚A.

2. Polarizability of He-He+

We have also tested the inﬂuence of the polarizability αi which appears in the He-He+ potential, and which has
been taken equal to the volume σ3
He−He+ . Calculations conducted with a value of αi reduced or increased by a factor
10 left the results nearly unaﬀected. This can be easily understood as in the domain where non-ideal eﬀects play a
role, He and He+ do not coexist in comparable fractions most of the time. Moreover, the contribution of Fpol to the
total free-energy remains always marginal.

Inﬂuence of the He+-He2+ coupling

As mentioned in Sec. III D 3, the long range interaction between He+, He2+ and e− is treated in a rather crude
way in the present model. We have tested the inﬂuence of this approximation by submitting a few tests without this
term. The results are illustrated in Fig. 8 for T = 104.5 K. We have checked other isotherms, and the conclusion is
that the EOS and its derivatives are nearly independent of this coupling term except in a very limited temperature-
density range. As illustrated in the next section, but also on Fig. 5, 7 and 8, the reason is that pressure ionization
occurs directly from He to He2+, with no regions where He+ and He2+ coexist in comparable number, except at
> 105 K) where temperature ionization dominates. Although we certainly cannot rule out the
high temperature (T

fact that this is an artefact of our model, a possible physical explanation might be the large diﬀerences between the
ground-state energies of the diﬀerent species, much larger than for hydrogen. The contribution of the ground-state
energy of He to the total free-energy thus prevents partial ionization to occur, favoring the atomic phase. As mentioned

coupling), the pressure, the massic entropy and the speciﬁc heat as a function of the density. If not speciﬁed, the solid line
corresponds to the case with coupling and the dotted line to the case without any coupling; the temperature is T = 104.5 K.

previously, it will be interesting to compare this prediction with experimental results and ﬁrst-principle calculations,
once they will be available, to verify whether this behaviour is a ﬂaw of the present model or whether it reﬂects the
behaviour of helium pressure ionization, an extremely interesting issue.

B. Thermodynamical quantities

A subset of our ﬁnal EOS calculations, based on the model free-energy (20) is presented in Tables I-III, corresponding
to Fig. 9 (for the pressure), Fig. 10 (for the massic entropy) and Fig. 11 (for the speciﬁc heat). For these calculations,
ten internal levels have been considered, both for He and He+. These ten levels are enough to represent the internal
partition function as the highest levels are always destroyed even for the lowest density we are considering. No He
doubly excited states have been considered in our calculation. This is a reasonable approximation because of the two
following reasons. First of all, the high energy cost of these states (the ﬁrst doubly excited state lies
60 eV above the
He ground state) disfavors their formation (in a way similar to the direct ionization of He to He2+ without any He+
state, see following discussion). The second reason is their rapid decay by autoionization (typically in 10−13
10−14 s).
It is therefore unlikely that these states survive in the midst of interacting neighbour particles. The zero of energy
1 stems
corresponds to the fully ionized plasma at zero temperature. The rising behaviour of CV for log10 ρg/cm3
from correlations between helium atoms (conﬁgurational free-energy), since all excited levels are destroyed at this
density, at least for the coolest temperature. The drop at larger density reﬂects pressure ionization, from He to He2+.
We also present in Fig. 12 the phase diagram of helium. The lines separate the diﬀerent domains where either He, He+
or He2+ is the dominant species, i.e. represents a fraction larger than 50 %. As mentioned previously, an interesting

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have computed a free-energy model aimed at deriving the thermodynamic quantities of dense
ﬂuid helium, from the low-density atomic domain to the high-density fully ionized regime, covering the regime of
partial ionization. The model is based on the so-called chemical picture for the description of the interactions between
the diﬀerent species in the ﬂuid. The abundances of the various atomic and ionic components are obtained through
minimization of the free-energy. Despite the shortcomings inherent to the chemical approach, we believe the present
model to give a reasonable description of the equation of state of dense helium, including the regime of pressure
ionization. Although the basis of the model become of doubtful validity in this latter domain, this aﬀects only limited
regions of the temperature-density diagram. Comparisons with available sound speed measurements and shock-wave
experiments for atomic helium assess the validity of the model up to the megabar range, whereas at very high density
the model recovers the fully ionized plasma model and thus Monte-Carlo simulations of the thermodynamic properties
of the so-called one-component plasma (OCP) model. Although the present model cannot pretend giving a precise
determination of the various atomic and ionic concentrations in the ﬂuid, at least in the pressure ionization regimes, it
yields a reasonably accurate determination of the phase diagram of dense, ﬂuid helium with its various He/He+/He2+
< 105 K, pressure ionization is found to occur directly from atomic helium He to fully
ionization contours. For T

ionized helium He2+, or at least to a strongly ionized state, without He+ stage (xHe+ < a few %).
It would be
interesting to test such a prediction with high-pressure dynamical experiments. Indeed, such a behaviour of the phase
diagram bears important consequences for the thermodynamic, magnetic and transport properties of the interior

species coexist in comparable numbers. As a whole, the present model remains simple enough to allow the calculation
of the EOS of dense helium over an extended domain of pressure and density, a necessary condition for applications
to the computation of stellar and giant planet internal structure and high-pressure experiment diagnostics.

Besides its astrophysical interest, the calculation of the phase diagram of dense helium is of intrinsic theoretical
interest. Indeed, comparison betwen these calculations and near-future high-pressure shock-wave or laser experiments
will allow a better determination of the domains of validity of the present model and of the possible improvements.
By such, these comparisons will yield a better understanding of the properties of matter under extreme conditions,
and more speciﬁcally of the complex regime of matter pressure ionization and metallization.

We are very grateful to Alexander Potekhin and G´erard Massacrier for very useful discussions and insightful remarks.

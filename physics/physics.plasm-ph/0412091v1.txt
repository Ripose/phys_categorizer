Spectral line shapes in low frequency turbulent tokamak plasmas

(Dated: July 23, 2013)

In this paper we investigate the inﬂuence of low frequency turbulence on Doppler spectral line
shapes in magnetized plasmas. Low frequency refers here to ﬂuctuations whose typical time scale
is much larger than those characterizing the atomic processes, such as radiative decay, collisions
and charge exchange. This ordering is in particular relevant for drift wave turbulence, ubiquitous
in edge plasmas of fusion devices. Turbulent ﬂuctuations are found to aﬀect line shapes through
both the spatial and time averages introduced by the measurement process. The proﬁle is expressed
in terms of the ﬂuid ﬁelds describing the plasma. Assuming the spectrometer acquisition time to
be much larger than the turbulent time scale, an ordering generally fulﬁlled in experiments, allows
to develop a statistical formalism. We proceed by investigating the eﬀects of density, ﬂuid velocity
and temperature ﬂuctuations alone on the Doppler proﬁle of a spectral line emitted by a charge
exchange population of neutrals. Line wings are found to be aﬀected by ion temperature or ﬂuid
velocity ﬂuctuations, and can in some cases exhibit a power-law behavior. This study gives some
insights in the appearance of non-Boltzmann statistics, such as L´evy statistics, when dealing with
averaged experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

Spectral line shape studies have played a major role
in the investigation of the nature of atomic radiators
and their environment, in astrophysics as well as in lab-

line broadening mechanisms, it is for instance possible
to retrieve the electron density or the ion temperature
from the analysis of a given line. However, in many
cases actual plasmas are far from thermal equilibrium,
being inhomogeneous or having non-Maxwellian velocity
distributions, features which signiﬁcantly complicate the
analysis of experimental data. In addition, these depar-
tures from thermal equilibrium can trigger instabilities,
whose growth and non-linear saturation eventually lead
to the onset of turbulence [1, 2, 3]. The importance of
investigating the possible eﬀects that turbulence might
have on line shapes has been acknowledged very early,
and the motivations of these studies were, and still are,
two-fold : ﬁrst there is the need to quantify the errors
introduced by neglecting turbulence in routine diagnosis
based on line-shapes. Then, the possible existence of sig-
niﬁcant deviations could be used to diagnose turbulence
itself. An optical diagnostic of turbulence based on pas-
sive spectroscopy would indeed be very convenient, this
sustainable technique being already available on numer-
ous experiments.

Historically, a large number of papers ([4, 5] and ref-
erences therein) have dealt with the Stark eﬀect result-
ing from turbulent electric ﬁelds, such as those associ-
ated to a high supra-thermal level of Langmuir waves [6].
Starting from the seminal paper by Mozer and Baranger
[7], several models have been devised to include turbu-
lent Stark broadening in the calculation of line-shapes.
The results thus obtained are relevant to plasmas for

5

which Stark eﬀect is dominant compared to Doppler ef-
fect. There are however situations for which this ordering
is reversed, and important examples are edge plasmas of
magnetic fusion devices such as Tokamaks in the ionizing
1020
regime. For these low density plasmas (Ne ≤
m−3), Zeeman and Doppler eﬀects are the dominant
broadening mechanisms for low lying lines such as the
Dα (transition between the levels n = 3 and n = 2 of
the atomic deuterium). In such cases, line shape stud-
ies essentially provide measurement of the emitters ve-
locity distribution, and have so far brought valuable re-
sults concerning the origin of neutrals in edge plasmas
[8, 9, 10, 11]. However, these plasmas are known to be
strongly turbulent, i.e. the level of ﬂuctuation of the ﬂuid
ﬁelds characterizing the plasma can rise up to several
tenths of percents [2]. The experimental characteriza-
tion of these ﬂuctuations is of ﬁrst importance to analyse
drift-wave (DW) turbulence, which is held responsible for
the so called anomalous transport degrading the quality
of the conﬁnement [3].

As an example, we will consider the case of the Balmer
α of hydrogen isotopes (Dα for the case of deuterium),
since it is one of the most routinely monitored line in
edge plasmas, being both intense and optically thin. In
sections II and III, the expression of the measured line
proﬁle is carefully discussed to emphasize the role of the
spatial and time averages involved in the measure. We
show in section II that a neutral population created by
charge exchange can be considered as being in a local
equilibrium characterized by the local density, tempera-
ture and ﬂuid velocity of the ions.
In sections IV and
V, we will show that in presence of low frequency turbu-
lence, the Doppler proﬁle gives access to an apparent ve-
locity distribution. By further developing the model only
brieﬂy presented in [12, 13], this apparent VDF is reex-

pressed in terms of the Probability Distribution Function
(PDF) of the ﬂuid ﬁelds. In section VI, the inﬂuence of
density, ﬂuid velocity and temperature are successively
investigated in details. Finally, it is shown in section VII
that for particular choices of the statistical properties of
the turbulent ﬂuctuations, the apparent VDF becomes
a L´evy distribution. This result establishes a clear con-
nection with one of our previous work [14], in which we
investigated the possible origin of a power law behavior
observed in the line wings of Dα spectra measured in the
former ergodic divertor conﬁguration of the Tore Supra
Tokamak.

EXPRESSION OF THE MEASURED

SPECTRA

Let us ﬁrst deﬁne precisely the observable quantity
for a spectrally resolved passive spectroscopy measure-
ment. First of all, obtaining the spectrum emitted by
the plasma (which will be referred to as the measured
spectrum in the following) from the raw spectrum in-
Iap. In
volves deconvolution of the apparatus function
practice, the theoretical spectrum is convolved with
Iap
before being compared to the raw spectrum. The ra-
diation emitted by the plasma is integrated both along
the Line Of Sight (LOS) and during the acquisition time
of the spectrometer, denoted by τm. The observable in-
Imes(∆λ), where ∆λ stands for the wavelength
tensity
detuning from the center of the line, is thus given by the
following expression

functions B(z, t) and
would generally result in spectra having very low signal to
noise ratios. To retrieve information from time resolved
measurements, one must then either forsake spectral res-
olution or resort to active techniques, such as Beam Emis-
sion Spectroscopy (BES), which allows to diagnose the
time behavior of turbulent density ﬂuctuations at the
edge of tokamaks (e.g.
[15, 16]). Conversely, if spectral
resolution is needed, the acquisition time should be suf-
ﬁciently large so as to ensure reasonable signal to noise
ratios. In this paper we will deal with the latter situa-
tion, for the limiting case in which the acquisition time
is much larger than the typical turbulent time scale. In
fact, this generally corresponds to the actual situation for
passive spectral line shapes measurements. Spectra thus
obtained will prove to yield further information than time
resolved experiments. The next step in the modelling
consists in relating the local brightness B and the local
proﬁle

to the parameters characterizing the plasma.

III. MODELLING OF THE LOCAL PROFILE

In this section we will ﬁrst describe the model that
will be used to describe the plasma, i.e. a set of ﬂuid
equations. The remainder of the section will present the
expressions of the local brightness and proﬁle relevant to
edge plasmas typical conditions.

A. Plasma description

We are interested in plasmas which can be described
by a set of N macroscopic ﬁelds denoted by X =
X1(r, t), . . . , XN (r, t)
, including the density, temper-
{
}
ature and ﬂuid velocity for each species. These ﬁelds are
solutions of a set of ﬂuid equations. For example, the
ﬁeld Xi(r, t) would satisfy to a conservation equation

is furthermore assumed that this set of ﬂuid equations

ﬂuid description relies on the ordering τ
coll, where τ
ν
is the typical time of variation of the ﬂuid ﬁelds and νcoll
the collision frequency (in the case of DW turbulence in
edge plasmas, we have τ
100 µs). The fulﬁllment

of this ordering ensures that the VDF Fγ of the species
γ = i, e remains close to a local Maxwellian at each time
and location

where mγ, Tγ(r, t) and uγ(r, t) are respectively the mass,
the temperature ﬁeld expressed in eV, and the ﬂuid ve-
locity ﬁeld of the species labeled by γ. In the following,
we shall consider the case of a pure deuterium plasma for
which Zef f = 1.

The calculation of the neutrals VDF requires the use
of a reﬁned model. Indeed, there are diﬀerent sources of
neutrals in edge plasmas of tokamaks, each of them giving
birth to a single class of neutrals. These classes, charac-
terized by diﬀerent temperatures, coexist since the den-
sity is usually too low in order to ensure their complete
relaxation toward the background local equilibrium. The
lowest temperature class originates from the dissociation
of molecules released from the wall, whereas those having
larger temperatures are mainly attributed to charge ex-
change reactions (e.g. [8, 9, 10, 11]). In the following, we
will only consider the class of neutrals locally created by
charge exchange reactions, that plays an important role
for the line wings behavior. Indeed, it will be shown that
turbulence essentially aﬀects these regions of the spec-
tra.
In order to model the VDF of these emitters, we
can once again take advantage of the separation of scales
between atomic processes and turbulence.
In fact, the
inverse of the charge exchange rate is of the order of a
few µs, i.e. shorter than the typical turbulent time scale.
As a result, the emitters VDF remains at each time close
to that of the ions, given by Eq. (7) with γ = i. From
the microscopic point of view, the emitter’s VDF thus
appears as a Maxwellian characterized by a set of slowly
varying macroscopic ﬁelds.

B. The local brightness

The local

line brightness is directly related to the
population of the transition upper atomic level.
In
general, this population has to be calculated by tak-
ing into account the contributions of the diﬀerent pro-
cesses (for instance collisions, charge exchange, radia-
tive decay) populating or depopulating the levels.
If
the ﬂuid ﬁelds characterizing the plasma vary slowly on
the typical time scales associated to these processes, a
stationary approach is suitable to calculate the bright-
ness. The levels populations are assumed to be time
independent and are calculated using the values of the

In practice,
the brightness essentially depends on the electron density
Ne(r, t) and temperature Te(r, t). We have performed a
calculation of the brightness per emitter B1 (deﬁned as
B(r, t) = n0(r, t)B1(X(r, t)), where n0(r, t) is the density
of emitters) for the Dα line in edge plasma conditions,
1019 m−3 and Te = 1
i.e. Ne = 1018
100 eV, using
the code SOPHIA [17]. The electron density dependence
of B1 is found to be linear, in accordance with the fact
that the upper level of the transition is essentially popu-
lated by electronic collisions from the ground state. This
leads to a quadratic behavior of the brightness with Ne,
since n0
Ne. The inﬂuence of the electron tempera-
ture on the brightness is more subtle, as shown on Fig.
1 for two diﬀerent densities. The existence of a maxi-
mum reﬂects the competition between the growth of the
electron collisions cross section with temperature, which
dominates the small temperatures behavior, and the ion-
isation process. For electron temperatures larger than 15
eV, the inﬂuence of Te on the brightness is weak, and in
the remainder of this paper, we shall therefore consider
the brightness as being only a function of the electron
density.

[4]. The Doppler proﬁle ID is related to the wavelength
shift introduced by the movement of the radiator along
the LOS, and is thus directly given by

ID(∆λ, z, t)d∆λ = f (vz, z, t)dvz,

where f (vz, z, t) stands for the emitters VDF along the

largely satisﬁed in edge plasmas, and is moreover not in-
consistent with the assumption τcol > τ underlying the
validity of Eq. (7). For a given line, the relative impor-
tance of the diﬀerent broadening mechanisms depends
on plasma conditions, i.e. on the average values taken
by the plasma density and temperature, but also on the
detuning ∆λ. In the following, we will again discuss the
case of the Dα line, ﬁrst for the bulk of the line and

In the center of the line, Stark eﬀect is negligible for den-
1020 m−3, an ordering which
sities lower than Ne = 5
is usually (but not always) satisﬁed in edge plasmas. In
addition, since the magnetic ﬁeld is larger than 1 T, ﬁne
structure can be neglected [19]. Therefore, the Dα line
splits into three Doppler-broadened Zeeman components
(one π and two σ). The lateral σ components are equally
separated from the central π component. Under parallel
observation with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld, only the
σ components are observable. Although negligible in the
bulk of the line, Stark eﬀect might become dominant in
the line wings for detunings larger than a value ∆λS(Ne)
which is an increasing function of the density. Therefore,
in the remainder of the paper it should be understood
that the Doppler line wings are the regions of the spectra
for which both orderings

depends on the plasma conditions. Its study is relevant
for edge plasmas and consequently Stark eﬀect will be ne-
glected in the remainder of the paper. However, it should

veloped in section V would also be applicable if Stark

According to Eq. (9), the Doppler spectrum of a single

tions, whose VDF is approximated by a local Maxwellian.

IV. APPARENT VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION

Gathering the results of the above sections, we obtain
the following expression for the measured proﬁle normal-

Imes(∆λ)d∆λ = fa(vz)dvz,
in analogy with Eq.(9). This VDF is an average of the

(13)

The apparent VDF fa can be given a deep physical
meaning as will be shown in section VII.

Intuitively, in plasmas where the ﬂuctuation rate is low,
fa should remain close to a Maxwellian feq characterized
by the time and space averaged values of the temperature
and the velocity ﬁelds, respectively denoted by ¯T and ¯uz,
i.e

fa(vz)

feq(vz; ¯T , ¯uz).

(15).

Conversely, in a situation where strong ﬂuctuations oc-
cur, there is a priori no obvious reason for which the
apparent velocity distribution should remain close to the
average Maxwellian given by Eq.
In particular,
in edge plasmas the ﬂuctuation rate can rise up to sev-
eral tenths of percents. The validity of Eq. (15) then
clearly becomes questionable, and Eq.
(14) should be
used instead. A calculation of the apparent VDF fa can
be carried out from the latter equation once the solu-
tions of the ﬂuid equations are known, i.e. the time and
space dependences of each of the ﬁelds Xi(r, t) have been
worked out. Due to the non-linear nature of the ﬂuid

5

equations and the complexity of the geometry, this cal-
culation would best be achieved numerically. Although
such an approach might be able to encompass the com-
plexity of the problem, we ﬁnd it worthwhile to begin
with a simpler one in order to gain insights on the kind
of eﬀects that turbulence might produce on spectral line
shapes.

STATISTICAL FORMALISM

A. Expression of the proﬁle

In the following, we will take advantage of the fact that
the acquisition time of the spectrometer is usually much
larger than the typical time scale of the turbulence τ .

tions, and ﬁnally making use of the delta function sifting

B. Discussion

In the frame of our statistical reformulation, it is no
longer necessary to know the solutions of the ﬂuid equa-
tions in order to calculate the apparent VDF. Instead,
the joint PDF of the turbulent ﬁelds should have been
computed. A straightforward approach would be to rely
on a ﬂuid code, so as to compute histories of the dif-
ferent ﬁelds, and then their PDF. As we have already
pointed out, this would require heavy numerical compu-
tation, especially in order to obtain the PDF tails with
a good accuracy. Furthermore, if such calculations were
carried out, any statistical reformulation would obviously
be superﬂuous, and the apparent VDF could directly be
(14). An approach more suited to
obtained from Eq.
our formalism should proceed directly at the PDF level.
The next section will be devoted to present such a model,
initially developed by Pope [21]. However, it should be
emphasized that such a calculation is bypassed if assump-
tions for the shape of the PDF are made. This is the one
of the advantages of our formalism, since it allows to draw
conclusions on the properties that turbulence should have
so as to signiﬁcantly aﬀect line shapes.

C. Determination of the PDF from the ﬂuid
equations

Let us consider the passive advection of a scalar X(z, t)
solution of Eq. (6), in which the source term is an ar-
bitrary function of X and the ﬂux Γ is the sum of a
convective term and a diﬀusive term. The convective ve-
locity ﬁeld u is assumed to be an incompressible stochas-
tic ﬁeld, the statistical properties of which are known. In
order to calculate the apparent velocity distribution func-
tion from Eq. (21), the spatially integrated joint PDF of
velocity and temperature, denoted by W (u, ¯X), should
be calculated. Here, we will limit ourselves to the mod-
elling of the marginal distribution W ( ¯X), obtained by
integrating W (u, ¯X) over the velocity. Indeed, this will

6

be suﬃcient to highlight the salient points of the model.
Assuming homogeneous turbulence, and then following
Pope [21], the time dependent PDF W ( ¯X, t) is shown to
obey a Fokker-Planck like equation

As a result, in the PDF approach a non-linear source
term S does not introduce any closure problem, unlike
in the moment based models [1]. The problem remains
nonetheless unclosed, since the function D( ¯X) is in gen-
eral not expressible in terms of W ( ¯X) or S( ¯X) alone.
Indeed, the shape of this function depends on the cor-
relations between X and its gradient. More precisely, it
can be recast in the following form

should be kept in mind that the statistical properties
of the velocity ﬁeld u, while not appearing explicitly in
Eq. (24), do actually aﬀect the shape of D( ¯X) through
Eq. (6), as should the expression of S(X). The closure
of this hierarchy has proven to be diﬃcult to address.
Promising techniques, such as the mapping closure [22]
have been devised to overcome these diﬃculties, but have
not yet led to decisive results (for an application to the
Hasegawa-Mima equation governing plasma turbulence,
see Ref. [23]). Addressing these issues is largely beyond
the scope of the present paper, and for our purposes
it will be suﬃcient to present an early attempt to this
closure problem, due to Sinai and Yakhot [24]. These
authors were interested in the case of passive advection
of temperature in homogeneous decaying turbulence, for
which there is no source term in the temperature equa-
tion. Their idea is to deal with the rescaled quantity
X = T /

In an actual turbulent plasma, several ﬁelds ﬂuctuate,
and these ﬂuctuations are coupled. According to Eq.
(21), the joint PDF of the relevant ﬁelds should be com-
puted before calculating the apparent VDF. However, the
role of density, velocity and temperature ﬂuctuations on
the apparent VDF shape have no reason to be identical.
As a ﬁrst approximation, it is therefore rational to con-
sider the idealized case in which only one ﬁeld ﬂuctuates.
This will shed light on which ﬁeld ﬂuctuations lead to
the most signiﬁcant eﬀects on line shapes.

A. Density ﬂuctuations

FIG. 2: Plot of the Sinai PDF for T0 = 30 eV, k = 10 and
for diﬀerent values of σ = 5, 10, 20 eV. These distributions are
used to compute the corresponding apparent VDF on Fig. 6

where the parameter k > 0 is a measure of the correla-
tions strength. From Eq. (24), the following result for
the temperature PDF is readily obtained

where C is a normalization constant, and σ controls the
width of the distribution. Fig. 2 shows a plot of W (T )
for T0 = 30 eV, k = 10 and σ = 5, 10, 20 eV. A few sub-
tleties and limitations concerning the use of this result
deserve to be mentioned. First, it should be noted that
σ is actually time dependant. We shall assume here that
the acquisition time τm is chosen such that σ/ ˙σ
τm.
This requires a separation of time scales between the tur-
bulent ﬂuctuations and the decay of the average quanti-
ties. Secondly, the correlations are treated using the de-
velopment given by Eq. (26), which is not valid for large
values of the temperatures. Our results concerning line
wings should thus be limited to not too large detuning
∆λ. Finally, it should be pointed out that the distribu-
tion given by Eq. (27) is a Tsallis distribution (e.g. [25])
with q = (1 + 2k)−1. Therefore, in this model, tempera-
ture ﬂuctuations obey to Tsallis non-extensive statistical
mechanics [25] when correlations exist, and to Boltzmann
statistics for vanishing correlations.

≪

In the next section, we shall use these results as an

input for apparent VDF calculations.

Let us ﬁrst consider density ﬂuctuations. Since the lo-
cal VDF normalized to unity does not depend on density,
the integration over density ﬂuctuations is trivially per-
formed, and the apparent VDF is found to be equal to
the local emitters VDF

+∞

0
Z

fa(vz) =

dn B(n) W (n) f (vz, T ) = f (vz, T ). (28)

Therefore, at this level of approximation, Doppler line
shapes are not sensitive to density ﬂuctuations. The ap-
parent VDF should thus remain Gaussian with the tem-
perature T , whatever the shape of W (n). This is in
sharp contrast with line brightness time resolved mea-
surements, which essentially provide information on den-
sity ﬂuctuations. However, it should be noted that for
cases in which Stark eﬀect is not negligible, Eq. (28) no
longer holds, since the local line shape then strongly de-
pends on the density. As we have already pointed out,
the formalism presented here could nevertheless be used
upon replacing the local Doppler proﬁle by the total pro-
ﬁle given by Eq. (8).

B. Fluid velocity ﬂuctuations

Let us now investigate the case in which only the ﬂuid

of sight, and σ2

the apparent VDF reduces to

which is the convolution product of W and the local
Maxwellian. Eq. (29) is a well known result in plasma
spectroscopy, which is mentioned in classical textbooks
[26]. A shape-independent deﬁnition of the apparent

In the ﬂuctuations-free case, the actual temperature of
the emitters T is recovered, whereas if ﬂuctuations do
occur the apparent temperature is given by

where vth is the thermal velocity corresponding to the
temperature T . The apparent temperature obtained
from the Doppler line width is thus not rigorously equal
to the actual temperature of the emitters. This result
has already been mentioned by several authors, and was
actually used in the ﬁrst models retaining the eﬀect of
turbulence on Doppler line shapes [27]. In order to ob-
tain a ten percents discrepancy between Ta and T for
deuterium emitters, the ﬂuctuation rate should be of the
0.3 vth). This eﬀect
order of thirty percents (i.e. σu ∼
would be stronger for heavy emitters, since their thermal
velocity is smaller [26]. This estimation suggests that the
Dα line width is not strongly modiﬁed by ﬂuid velocity
ﬂuctuations. However, considering only the line width is
not suﬃcient. In fact, the line shape, i.e. the apparent
VDF, is often found to be non-Gaussian, and therefore
from Eq. (29), so should be the PDF W (uz). Recent
ﬁndings in astrophysical spectra [28, 29, 30], as well as in
tokamak plasmas for radial velocity ﬂuctuations [31] in-
dicate strong deviations from the Maxwellian, especially
for line wings. As an illustration, let us consider PDFs
which have power law tails characterized by an exponent
α such that 0 < α < 2.
It is easily shown from Eq.
(29) that the resulting apparent VDF features a similar
asymptotical dependence

Such a behavior would for instance arise if the velocity
PDF were a L´evy distribution (see section V). Examples
of these distributions are plotted on Fig. 3, for α =
0.5, 1, 1.5 and cα = vth/10. The resulting apparent
velocity are plotted on Fig. 4, and exhibit a power-law
behavior in their tails. However, it should be pointed
out that for this eﬀect to be observable, large amplitude
velocity ﬂuctuations of the order of a few thermal velocity
vth should actually occur. Finally, it should be noted that
in a magnetized plasma, the physics underlying parallel
and perpendicular velocity ﬂuctuations are diﬀerent. The
latter are related to the electric ﬁeld ﬂuctuations through

clearly seen.

whereas the former can arise from a Kelvin-Helmholtz

(34)

The latter is not a convolution product, in opposition
to the case of velocity ﬂuctuations. To begin with, the
apparent temperature deﬁned by Eq. (30), is given by

Ta =

dT W (T ) T,

(35)

and is thus equal to the mean temperature of the distri-
bution W (T ). Hence, Ta does not depend on the temper-
ature ﬂuctuations variance. The proﬁle is obtained as a
weighted sum of Gaussians of diﬀerent widths, and thus
cannot stay rigorously Gaussian itself. Nevertheless, for
a sharp temperature PDF peaked around T0, the actual
deviations from Gaussianity should not be very impor-
tant, as the dominant contribution in the integral of Eq.
(34) is expected to come from the neighborhood of T0.
However, while leading to accurate results for the central
part of the proﬁle, this line of argument is not correct for
the line wings. Indeed, the value of f (T0, vz) scales with
vz as

f (T0, vz)

and therefore strongly decreases as vz increases. Con-
sequently, as shown on Fig. 5, the contribution of the
maximum of the temperature PDF in the integral be-
comes negligible for large enough vz (i.e.
in the wings
of the apparent VDF), and this especially if W (T ) has a
slowly decreasing tail.

For instance, an algebraic behavior for the tempera-
ture PDF implies a similar one for the measured proﬁle.
The relation between the exponents can be obtained in
the following manner, noting that for large velocities the

ancies become important in the apparent VDF tails (i.e.
Doppler line wings), all the more so σ is increased. In
addition, the tails are found to exhibit a linear behavior
in logarithmic scale, which signals a power-law depen-
dence. The exponent which characterizes this algebraic
decay should take the value
2/k according to Eq.
(38). The k dependence can be checked on Fig. 7 where
the apparent VDF is plotted for σ = 10 eV and for diﬀer-
ent values of k (k = 1, 1/2, 10), i.e. diﬀerent correlation
strengths. The stronger the correlations, the larger the
deviations from the Maxwellian.

such that 1 < 2α + 1 < 3 and therefore spans a diﬀerent
range than in the Sinai model.

In this idealized model where only temperature ﬂuctu-
ates, the analysis of the apparent VDF tails, i.e. of the
line wings, allows to retrieve information on the statisti-
cal properties of temperature ﬂuctuations. Indeed, power
law decaying tails would for instance be a signature of a
similar behavior for the temperature PDF. In addition, in
this case, an analysis of the experimental value of the ex-
ponent would allow to distinguish between diﬀerent tur-
bulence models, corresponding for example either to a
Sinai or a L´evy PDF.

D. Discussion

The study of the case where only one variable ﬂuc-
tuates leads to several enlightening conclusions. First
of all, the Doppler proﬁle is only aﬀected by ion tem-
perature and ﬂuid velocity ﬂuctuations along the line of
sight, in contrast to the line brigthness which essentially
reﬂects the variations of the density.
In addition, the
bulk of the line appears to be weakly sensitive to the
presence of low frequency turbulence, unless the velocity
ﬂuctuations variance becomes comparable to the thermal
velocity. Therefore, turbulence can indeed be neglected if
we restrict ourselves to the study of the core of the line,
as is usually done [8, 10, 11]. Conversely, the Doppler
line wings behavior is signiﬁcantly altered by turbulent
ﬂuctuations having non-Gaussian PDF. More precisely,
long tails for the PDF translates into long tails for the
apparent VDF, i.e. slowly decreasing line wings. In this
sense, modiﬁcations on line wings are associated to in-
termittency. A comparison with experimental spectra
would require further work both from the theoretical and
experimental sides, and will not be attempted here. In

particular, a reﬁned model should simultaneously retain
velocity and temperature ﬂuctuations. Indeed, velocity
and temperature eﬀects cannot be distinguished a priori.
In fact, examples where ﬂuctuations of both ﬁelds lead to
a power law behavior for line wings have been presented
above. In addition, the couplings between density, veloc-
ity and temperature ﬂuctuations, which are responsible
for anomalous transport, should also be taken into ac-
count. To include these eﬀects in our model, one could
either rely on the determination of a joint PDF, or resort
to a numerical integration of the ﬂuid equations, which
would allow a straightforward calculation of the appar-
ent VDF from Eq. (14). From the experimental point
of view, line wings may seem diﬃcult to measure, but it
should be kept in mind that the acquisition time can in
principle be chosen as large as needed. The only limita-
tion here is the actual duration of the discharge station-
ary phase during which the measurements are performed.

VII. APPARENT NON-BOLTZMANN
STATISTICS

In the above section, we have shown that the apparent
VDF may signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the Maxwellian calcu-
lated using the averaged ﬁelds. For the sake of simplicity,
let us only consider temperature ﬂuctuations here. The
fact that the apparent VDF can be a L´evy distribution
highlights a connection between spectroscopy, turbulence
and anomalous statistics involving power-law tails, such
as the L´evy statistics. Indeed, it should be emphasized
that in the case where no other observable than the spec-
in Astrophysics), it is
tral line shape is available (e.g.
by no mean possible to determine whether the observed
plasma is actually turbulent or homogenous. Therefore,
if the temperature PDF is a L´evy distribution
Lα,−1(T ),
the Doppler spectra might be interpreted as resulting
from an homogeneous and stationary plasma governed
by Levy statistics. In other words, everything happens
as if the plasma under study were in a non-equilibrium
stationary state characterized by the L´evy distribution
of Eq. (42). This stationary state can be seen as result-
ing from a relaxation process governed by the following
Fractional Fokker-Planck Equation (FFPE) [14, 33, 34]

The usual Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is recovered for

be Gaussian. The main physical diﬀerence between the
FPE and the FFPE given by Eq. (44) is the spatial non
locality of the latter, obvious from the deﬁnition of the
fractional derivative. This non locality is a consequence
of the existence of ﬂights connecting distant regions in the
velocity space (the so-called L´evy ﬂights). This property
can be traced back to the underlying description of the
turbulent plasma. Indeed, at the microscopical scale the
trajectory of the radiators can be modelled by a Langevin
equation with gaussian white noise [35, 36]. This model
describes the collisional relaxation of the local velocity
distribution toward the local Maxwellian Eq. (7). Using
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem and the expression
of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient stemming from a random walk
model [36] leads to

(46)

where T is the local temperature and τj the typical time
between two jumps in the velocity space. Temperature
thus determines the characteristic size of jumps in the ve-
locity space. Therefore, high probabilities for large tem-
perature ﬂuctuations in the actual turbulent plasma im-
ply high probabilities for ﬂights in the apparent velocity
space. This provides a simple physical picture explain-
ing why the temperature PDF and the apparent VDF
asymptotical behavior are linked, and leads to a deeper
understanding of Eq. (38). Our results are reminiscent
of those presented in references [35, 37, 38], where a sim-
ilar interpretation of Tsallis non extensive statistical me-
chanics occurrence was proposed. The latter case arises
if the temperature PDF is such that 1/T is gamma dis-
tributed [37]. Let us emphasize that in our model, the
temperature PDF shape is not arbitrary. In fact, it has
to be determined from the ﬂuid equation satisﬁed by the
temperature ﬁeld in the plasma under consideration, in
which relevant expressions for both the source term and
the ﬂux have to be speciﬁed (see Eq. 6). For each of these
expressions, the non-linear character of the latter equa-
tion should give rise to a diﬀerent non-gaussian statistical
behavior, i.e. lead to a speciﬁc PDF, and therefore to a
particular apparent statistics. A natural extension of this
work would be to determine what properties ﬂuid equa-
tions should have so as to lead to a L´evy distribution for
temperature.

VIII. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES

In this paper, we have presented a model retaining low
frequency turbulence in Doppler line shape calculations.
This approach is in particular relevant to the modelling
of lines routinely measured in edge plasmas of fusion de-
vices. We have shown that in presence of low frequency
turbulence, a straightforward analysis of Doppler proﬁles
yields an apparent velocity distribution function. This
apparent VDF is a spatial and time average of the local

VDF. To investigate its shape, we have used a statisti-
cal description of the plasma turbulent ﬂuctuations, rel-
evant whenever the acquisition time of the spectrometer
is large with respect to the typical turbulent time scale.
The resulting expression for the apparent VDF involves
the joint Probability Density Function of the ﬂuctuating
ﬁelds. Next, considering the case where only one variable
ﬂuctuates, we have obtained several new results. While
density ﬂuctuations do not aﬀect Doppler line shapes,
velocity or ion temperature ﬂuctuations can strongly in-
ﬂuence line wings. This is especially the case when their
PDF have long tails such as power laws. It might there-
fore be possible to diagnose such a behavior by the mean
of line shapes, once Stark eﬀect has been carefully ruled
out. A reliable comparison with experiments would im-
ply dedicated measurements which are not yet available,
but also further modelling.
In particular, the use of a
turbulence code would be very helpful for diagnosis pur-
poses, and this possibility will be investigated in a future
work. From a more fundamental point of view, our work

12

sheds light on some possible connections between turbu-
lence, spectroscopy and non Boltzmann statistics, such
as those involving L´evy or Tsallis distributions. Our ap-
proach furthermore relates the occurrence of one of these
particular statistics to the properties of the ﬂuid equa-
tions describing turbulence. Our model thus provides a
frame to investigate both experimentally and theoreti-
cally some of the fundamentals aspects of the statistical
properties of the physical observables in out of equilib-
rium plasmas.

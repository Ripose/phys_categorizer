Abstract

A basic concept to calculate physical features of non-ideal plasmas, such as optical prop-
erties, is the spectral function which is linked to the self-energy. We calculate the spectral
function for a non-relativistic hydrogen plasma in GW -approximation. In order to go beyond
GW approximation, we include self-energy and vertex correction to the polarization function
in lowest order. Partial compensation is observed. The relation of our approach to GW and
GW Γ calculations in other ﬁelds, such as the band-structure calculations in semiconductor
physics, is discussed. From the spectral function we derive the absorption coeﬃcient due to
inverse bremsstrahlung via the polarization function. As a result, a signiﬁcant reduction of
the absorption as compared to the Bethe-Heitler formula for bremsstrahlung is obtained.

Introduction

Spectroscopy can serve as a versatile tool to infer properties of dense and hot plasmas from the
emitted radiation[1, 2].
In non-ideal plasmas, where the coupling parameter can exceed unity,
properties often deviate signiﬁcantly from their form in ideal plasmas due to the importance of
interaction eﬀects [3]. With the advent of femtosecond laser pulses [4], it has become possible
to produce non-ideal plasmas with table-top systems. In particular, it is nowadays possible to
create conditions similar to those in the center of astrophysical objects such as the sun or giant
planets. Eﬀects such as dynamical screening, dissolution of bound states, Pauli-blocking, and the
importance of collisions have been observed [3]. Taking proper account of interaction eﬀects is a
challenge to any theoretical description of non-ideal plasmas.

Many-body perturbation theory presents a toolbox to determine various properties of non-ideal
plasmas [5, 6, 7]. The use of Green’s function techniques allows for a systematic and intuitive
consideration of many-body eﬀects. In particular, one-particle properties can be obtained from
the one-particle Green’s function or its spectral representation, the one-particle spectral function.
A number of important mechanisms in dense plasmas such as dynamical screening of the Coulomb
interaction can be described by partial summation of certain diagrams. A particularly successful
concept is the quasi-particle picture [5, 6, 7]. However, with increasing coupling the quasi-particle
pictures breaks down. This shows up in a broadening of the spectral function. To go beyond
the quasi-particle picture in a consistent way poses serious problems of self-consistency. Vertex
and self-energy corrections have to be taken into account on the same footing to obey sum rules
and other exact known properties. Using Ward identities [8] or the Kadanoﬀ-Baym scheme of
the conserving vertex [9] enables one to construct consistent sets of diagrams, alas the resulting
integral-equations are complicated to solve.

The GW approximation is a particularly scheme for the self-energy approximating it by a
product of the Green’s function G and an eﬀective interaction W [10]. Being introduced by Hedin

in 1965 [11], it has a long history of applications, which is reviewed in Ref. [12] and [13]. However,
the full self-consistency implied in Hedin’s original proposal was not carried out so far. Instead, the
ideal Green’s function or a quasi-particle picture was used. In this manner, the GW approximation
was successfully applied to determine shifts in the ionization potential, approximations for the
equation of state, and an eﬀective interaction to describe bound states in a medium [7]. Also, the
band structure of diﬀerent types of materials, like semiconductors [14], alkali [15], and transition
metals [16] was determined. Due to the eﬃciency of modern computer technology, it has recently
become feasible to address the self-consistency implied in Hedin’s scheme to some extent, see
[17, 18, 19, 20]. Some of these calculations improve solely on self-energy corrections, while
e.g.
others take into account vertex contributions as well.
It is customary to call the later GW Γ
approximations. In this paper, we perform calculations for the optical properties of a hydrogen
plasma at solar core conditions, as an important example for astrophysical plasmas. Typical
parameters of the solar core plasma are temperatures of about T = 100 Ry ≃ 1360 eV/kB and
particle densities reaching n ≃ 7·1024 cm−3. These parameters justify the model of a classical (non-
degenerate) and weakly coupled plasma, being characterized by values of θ = kBT /EF ≃ 10 for
the degeneracy parameter and Γ = (Ze2/4πǫ0)/(3/4πn)1/3kBT ≃ 0.03 for the coupling parameter.
Central to the description of optical properties of plasmas is the dielectric function ǫ(k, ω)
[1]. Within the frame of the approach presented here, it can be obtained from the polarization
function, which is a member of Hedin’s set of equations. In an earlier paper [21], the suppression
of the bremsstrahlung cross section due to successive scattering has been treated by a taking
into account self-energy and vertex corrections. However, these corrections were only considered
within a one-loop approximation. In this way, dynamical screening eﬀects were neglected. It is the
objective of this communication to present results with an improved one-particle spectral function
as obtained with the GW Γ approximation.

In Sec. 2, we will review the GW approximation making use of Hedin’s equations. Sec. 4

coeﬃcient are discussed in Sec. 6. A discussion and conclusions will be given in Sec. 7.

If not otherwise indicated, we apply the Rydberg system of units where ~ = kB = 1 , e2 =

2 , ǫ0 = 1/4π , and me = 1/2.

2 The GW Γ approximation

A convenient starting point of our approach are Hedin’s equations [22].
It is a closed set of
equations relating the full Green’s function G, the non-interacting Green’s function G0, the self-
energy Σ, the dynamically screened interaction Wab [10], the polarization function Π, and the
vertex function Γ. In detail, the full Green’s function is given by

Ga(12) = Ga,0(12) +

d(34) Ga,0(13) Σa(34) Ga(42) .

(1)

Z

Here and in the following, the shorthand notation (1) ≡ (r1, τ1, σ1 . . .) for spatial variables r,
imaginary times τ as well as quantum numbers such as spin is used. The self-energy Σa(12) is
obtained from the dynamically screened interaction and the vertex function according to

Σa(12) = i

d(34) Ga(13) Waa(41) Γa(32, 4) .

The dynamical screened interaction is given via

Wab(12) = Vab(12) +

d(34)Vac(13) Πcc(34)Wcb(42)

by the polarization function

Πaa(12) =

d(34)Ga(13)Ga(41)Γa(34, 2) .

The set of equations represents a perturbation expansion in terms of the screened interaction
Wab and is expected to show better convergence properties compared to an expansion in the
inter-particle interaction Vab.

By truncating the set of equations (1)-(5) on a certain level, various approximations for these
quantities can be deﬁned. A particular simple approximation is the G0W 0 approximation [11, 22].
It is obtained by taking the bare vertex Γ(12, 3) = δ(12)δ(13) and inserting non-interacting Green’s
functions into the expression for the polarization function. This leads to a self-energy given by
ΣGW
(12) = iGa(12)Waa(21). Next, the Green’s functions in this expression as well as in the
a
screened interaction W are taken as the free Green’s function G0. This expression turns out to
be quite successful. However, in dense plasmas as well as in a number of materials in solid state
physics, there is need to improve beyond this simple approximation.

Such an improvement is the GW 0 approximation which was studied in Ref. [23] for the electron
gas at T = 0 and in Ref. [24] for the solar core plasma. In the latter case, a considerably broadened
quasiparticle and a featureless behaviour at the plasma frequency was found. No plasmon-like
satellite structures survived the partial self-consistency treatment.

Another straightforward extension is a self-consistent solution of Dyson’s equation and the
screened interaction while keeping the vertex function in lowest order [18]. This will be termed
GW approximation in this paper. In Ref. [18], an increase in the quasiparticle bandwidth and a
featureless satellite structure is found in contradiction to experimental evidence. Also, such an
approximation leads to a drastic violation of the f-sum for the inverse dielectric function. The
results indicate the importance of vertex corrections [25]. Calculations for a one-dimensional
semiconductor [26] lead to similar conclusions. Large cancellations between self-energy and vertex
corrections have also been found in Ref. [27, 28, 29, 30, 31].

Recently, a number of approximation schemes to take into account vertex corrections have been
proposed [32]. In this work we will apply a sequence of approximations described in the following:
Taking the self-energy in the GW -approximation, the functional derivative occurring in the

vertex equation (5) yields in lowest order of Waa

aa(12)δ(14)δ(25)δab .

(6)

Note that the screened interaction is taken in the one-loop approximation for Π, the so-called
random-phase approximation (RPA). This term leads to a ladder approximation for the vertex in
terms of the dynamically screened interaction

Γa(12, 3) = δ(12)δ(13) +

d(67)W 0

aa(12)Ga(16)Ga(72)Γa(67, 3) .

(7)

Already this equation is challenging to solve [33], even in Shindo approximation [34]. As a result,
the improved self-energy in this approximation is given in second order of the dynamically screened
interaction by the term studied in Ref. [17],

At this stage the ﬁrst iteration of Hedin’s equations (1)-(5) is completed. We will not go beyond
this ﬁrst iteration, in particular the screened interaction potential Waa is kept on the level of RPA.

To address the deviations from the quasi-particle picture, the introduction of the one-particle

of Laplace transform. The quasi-particle approximation itself can be stated as a δ-like form of the
spectral function

pared to the plasma frequency ωpl = 4(πn)1/2. For details, we refer to Refs. [1, 24].

3 Applications of GW approximation for the self-energy

The GW approximation has been very successfully used for a broad variety of problems in many-
particle physics for a long time. Here we would like to mention only a few examples.

One of the ﬁrst applications in solid state physics was the calculation of band structures com-
bining density functional theory (DFT) and the GW -method. Northrup et al.
[15] showed how
this approach improves the band-gap problem of the local density approximation (LDA), which
predicts too small band-gaps for most materials, whereas the use of GW helps to decrease the de-
viation of the theoretical from the experimental value below 0.1 eV in the case of silicon, compared
to about 1 eV as obtained from pure LDA-DFT. Similar results were obtained for many diﬀerent
semi-conductors and insulators [13, 37]. Optical properties of highly excited semiconductors using
a combined GW and T-Matrix approach have been studied extensively by Schmielau et al., see
Ref’s [38, 39, 40]. Also in the case of ﬁnite systems, the GW approximation has been applied suc-
cessfully. For the case of the Na4 tetramer, good agreement between the theoretically predicted
photoabsorption and experimental data was obtained [41].

Nuclear and quark matter have been investigated using techniques very similar to the approach
presented here. The problem of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, which cannot be described in
a perturbative calculation of quark propagators, was demonstrated to emerge in a nonperturbative
approach known in quantum ﬁeld theory as rainbow-ladder approximation [42, 43].

Fehr et al. [44] and Wierling et al. [24] investigated spectral properties of electrons in nonideal
plasmas making use of the GW approximation. Whereas Fehr applied the perturbative G0W 0
approach (c.f. section 2) to both equation of state and optical properties, Wierling already used
a self-consistent GW 0 approximation which is also used here in the following section.

4 GW 0 approximation for the solar core plasma

In the GW 0 approximation, the set of Hedin’s equation reduces to a self-consistent solution of
Dyson’s equation with the correlated part of the self-energy,

Ae(p, ω + iη) =

Σe(~p, ω + iη) = −

As indicated by W 0, the dielectric function ǫ(q, ω) is taken in random phase approximation (RPA)
−1. Here, as in the following, electrons
and the Bose function is given as nB(ω) = (exp (−ω/T ) − 1)
labeled by a = e are considered. Note that the Hartree-Fock self-energy, which appears as an
additional term in Eq. (20) is small for the considered parameters and is henceforth neglected.

We give results for a hydrogen plasma using the conditions at the solar core center. We ignore
other ions such as helium etc.
In Fig. 1, the self-consistent

(20), is shown for a ﬁxed momentum of p = 0.21a
B . The grey curve is the initial ansatz for
the spectral function, i.e. the input for the r.h.s. of Eq. (20). It has been chosen of Lorentzian
form with a width of γ = 10 Ry. The ﬁrst iteration is given by the dashed-dotted curve. The
peak of the spectral function is shifted to smaller frequencies and the function is asymmetrically
broadened. The second and third iteration give only minor modiﬁcations to the ﬁrst iteration, the
forth iteration (not shown) does not vary signiﬁcantly from the third iteration.

For comparison, we also show the G0W 0 approximation, i.e. the ﬁrst iteration of Eq. (20)
starting from a spectral function of vanishing width (delta-distribution). In this case, there is no
quasiparticle peak at the quasiparticle resonance ωQP = p2, but four satellites and minima appear.

The latter are due to sharp peaks in the response function Im ǫ
earlier [45, 46].

RPA(k, ω) and have been observed

As a result of this calculation, we observe, that the self-consistent calculation leads to a spectral
function that is physical easily understandable, i.e. it contains a broadened and shifted quasipar-
ticle resonance. However, the signatures of collective eﬀects, such as the dynamical screening,
which are present in the G0W 0 approximation (dash-dotted curve in Fig. 1) vanish completely in
the self-consistent result. In contrast, the G0W 0 result does not contain a broadened quasiparticle
peak but is completely determined by the behaviour of the response function, which contains the
collective excitations of the plasma (plasmons), as also shown by Fehr et al., see Ref. [47].

Although convergence is already achieved after 3-4 iterations of Eqs. (19) and (20), the calcula-
tion is too time-consuming to be used in the computation of physical observables such as equation
of state or the polarization function, the latter involving convolution integrals over two spectral
functions in both momentum and frequency domain. Therefore, we make use of some further
approximations. First, we replace the full RPA-like screened interaction by a one-loop approxima-
tion, which takes into account the scattering among particles in Born approximation. In this case
we only consider electron-ion scatterings. Ions are treated in adiabatic approximation and the
interaction is mediated by a statically screened potential of Debye-type, i.e. Vei(q) = 8π/(q2 + κ2),
where κ = (8πn/T )1/2 is the inverse Debye screening length. This approximation is justiﬁed by
the fact that the corresponding absorption cross-section leads to the nonrelativistic limit of the
Bethe-Heitle formula for inverse bremsstrahlung in the limit of vanishing κ, as shown in [21].

For small κ, the main contributions to the integral in Eq. (20) come from small q. Therefore,
we can neglect the shift in the momentum variable in the self-energy on the r.h.s. As shown in
Ref. [21], one then obtains a particularly simple equation for the self-energy in this approximation,

which can be solved by standard root-ﬁnding algorithms. Fig. 2 shows the solution of Eq. (21) for
the same set of parameters as used in the RPA calculation (Fig. 1). To the left, the self-energy
(imaginary and real part), as well as the dispersion relation, and the spectral function as obtained
from the numerical solution of Eq. (21) are shown. The spectral function is centered around the
quasiparticle energy. Its overall shape is given by the imaginary part of the self-energy, while the
real part determines the dispersion. In the self-consistent solution, the dispersion relation contains
only a single root near the quasiparticle energy, while there are three roots in the quasiparticle
approximation (r.h.s of Fig. 2). The upper and lower root give rise to the two satellites in the
corresponding spectral function, while the central root does not yield a resonance due to the large
imaginary part of ΣG0W
s around ω = 1 Ry. The separation of the satellites from the quasiparticle
energy is approximately given by the plasma frequency. This is a general feature, which has been
observed in earlier calculations carried out at lower particle densities and temperatures [21].

In Fig. 3 we compare the spectral functions obtained from the two-component RPA and the
simpliﬁed Born approximation containing only the scattering of electrons on ﬁxed ions (Lorentz-
Plasma). Since electron-electron collisions are neglected in the latter case, the corresponding
spectral function is narrower than in the RPA calculation. Furthermore, in the one-loop ap-
proximation there are no plasmon degrees of freedom which leed to further damping in the RPA
calculation. On the other hand, the Lorentz plasma calculation already contains all characteristic
features of the RPA spectral function. Namely the asymmetrical broadening and the shift of the
peak towards lower energies show up. These features become less pronounced at higher momenta,
where many-particle eﬀects are expected to be less important. With increasing momentum, the
width of the spectral function decreases, while at the same time the height of the quasiparticle
peak increases, as can be seen in Fig. 4 . This follows naturally from the normalization condition

model for the self-energy leads physically intuitive one-particle spectral function which includes
the electron-ion collisions in a consistent way.

5 Applications of GW Γ-approximation for the self-energy

In the last years, substantial eﬀort has been made to go beyond the GW -approximation and to
include the vertex to some extent. In a pioneering paper, Takada [20] demonstrated the feasi-
bility of self-consistent GW Γ approximation. He used an ansatz for the vertex-function which
fulﬁls certain sum-rules and conservation laws. As a result, he showed the subtle cancellation of
contributions from self-energy and vertex-corrections to spectral properties of charged particles,
exempliﬁed for the damping of plasmons in Al. Very recently, Ziesche [48] has reviewed the cal-
culation of direct and exchange contributions (vertex correction) to the on-shell self-energy of the
homogenous electron-gas.

For plasmas, Vorberger et al. [35] systematically studied contributions to the equation of state
beyond Montroll-Ward, including all exchange terms (vertex corrections). In the same spirit, we
will now investigate the lowest order vertex correction to the self-energy in second order of the
interaction, given by the following diagrammatic expression.

Σ(2)(p, ω) =

+

.

(22)

The second diagram is the lowest order diagram which does not appear in the GW approximation,

8

whereas the ﬁrst diagram is automatically included. The base lines are free electron propagators,
while the upper loops are composed of ionic propagators taken in the adiabatic approximation.
To ensure convergence, a statically screened potential Vei(q) is used. The numerical evaluation
of Eq. (22) is shown in Fig. 5. The dashed and dotted curves give the ﬁrst and second iteration
respectively of the GW 0s approximation, the solid curve is the self-consistent result. For compar-
ison, the ﬁrst order vertex correction as obtained from the exchange diagram in Eq. (22) is shown
in the inset. The vertex term gives at most a 20% reduction of the self-energy.

6 Modiﬁcation of the absorption coeﬃcient

As an illustrative example, we calculate the impact of the broadened electron spectral function on
the absorption coeﬃcient due to inverse bremsstrahlung. The absorption coeﬃcient for radiation
in a plasma can be obtained from the dielectric function ǫ(q, ω), Eq. (18). According to Eq. (4),
nonideality eﬀects enter via self-energy corrections of the full Green’s functions and by vertex
corrections beyond the bare vertex. Within the GW approximation, only self-energy corrections
are considered, while the GW Γ also accounts for vertex terms in the polarization function.

6.1 Self-energy corrections

Using the self-consistent spectral function obtained in simpliﬁed GW 0 (Eq. (21)) to calculate the
polarization function, leads us to the result plotted as solid curve in Fig. 6. We normalize our result
to Kramers’ formula corrected by a Gaunt-factor in Born approximation [49, 50], which corresponds
to the non-relativistic limit of the Bethe-Heitler cross section for inverse Bremsstrahlung [51]. In
the infrared limit (ω → 0) the Born approximation shows a logarithmic divergence.

The result for solar core parameters is shown in Fig. 6. For small frequencies, a reduction of the
free-free absorption of about 15% as compared to Born approximation is observed, while at high
frequencies our approach converges to the Born approximation. At intermediate frequencies, we
obtain a slight enhancement of our result relative to the Born approximation. These characteristics
have already been observed in earlier calculations for lower densities and temperatures [21]. We
compare our results to calculations which use parametrized spectral functions of Gaussian shape
in the polarization loop (dashed and dotted curve). The width σ is given. Also in this case, an
enhancement is observed which decreases with decreasing width σ as can be seen by comparing
the dotted (σ = 6.5 Ry) and the dashed curve (σ = 13 Ry). The value σ = 6.5 Ry gives a Gaussian
spectral function of similar shape as the self-consistent calculation at small momenta. As shown
in Fig. 4, the self-consistently calculated spectral function converges to a quasi-particle resonance
at large momenta, i.e.
large frequencies. This behaviour leads to the faster convergence of the
absorption coeﬃcient to the Born result as compared to the calculation using Gaussians with
frequency and momentum independent widths. Remember that the Born result for the absorption
coeﬃcient is obtained by inserting delta-like spectral functions in the polarization function Eq. (4).

6.2 Vertex corrections

We have shown that the account of a broadened one-particle spectral function leads to a suppres-
sion of the infrared behaviour of the inverse bremsstrahlung spectrum. However, the calculations
have been carried out on the level of GW 0-approximation. Vertex corrections contribute to the
polarization function in the same order with respect to the statically screened potential. More-
over, these vertex corrections tend to cancel the self-energy correction to some extent. In order
to account for both types of corrections on the same footing, we focus on contributions from the
vertex equation, Eq. (5), up to ﬁrst order in the screened interaction in the polarization, Eq. (4),

Π(q, ω) =

+

.

In Fig. 7 we compare the suppression of the absorption coeﬃcient obtained from the inclu-
sion of self-energy only (solid curve) and with included vertex correction in the polarization loop
(dashed curve), c.f. Eq. (23). At the present parameters, the vertex correction is the most dom-
inant term. Over the whole range of frequencies considered here, we obtain a suppression of the
absorption coeﬃcient as compared to the Born approximation. Also, the enhancement of absorp-
tion at frequencies around ω = 10 Ry, which was observed in the calculation using only self-energy
corrections (solid curve), vanishes if the vertex is taken into account (dashed curve). This shows
the importance of vertex corrections.

Here, the vertex correction is only taken in lowest order of the interaction and density, while
the self-energy based result contains a summation to all orders of density. In order to compare
self-energy and vertex contributions to the modiﬁcation of the absorption spectrum in a fully
consistent way, one would have to go beyond the perturbative calculation presented here and solve
for the vertex equation Eq. (5) using at least free-particle propagators. This task goes beyond the
scope of this paper, where only the lowest order corrections are to be studied. Finally, we remark,
that in the mentioned earlier calculations presented in Ref. [21], the vertex correction modiﬁes
the self-energy result only to a minor extent, i.e. the enhancement at intermediate frequencies is
reduced by 40%. This is due to the lower density (1019 cm−3) used in that work. In all calculations,
the high frequency behaviour converges nicely to the Born result.

For the infrared part of the spectrum, the behaviour of the absorption coeﬃcient needs further
considerations, going beyond the present work. As shown in Fig. 7, the self-energy correction in the
polarization function reduces the absorption coeﬃcient by a constant factor of about 15% in the
low frequency limit, but does not regularize the infrared divergence of the Born approximation.
The vertex term, on the other hand, induces a large suppression so that in the low frequency
limit higher orders of the vertex correction have to be considered. Furthermore, it is well-known,
that below the plasma frequency (7 Ry for the solar core parameters) dynamic screening plays an
important rˆole. This needs a further summation of diagrams going beyond the present scheme. The
impact of dynamical screening on bremsstrahlung emission has been discussed by Ter-Mikaelyan
in Ref. [52].

7 Conclusions

A systematic treatment of optical properties in non-ideal plasmas is possible in the framework
of Green’s function methods. Corrections beyond the quasi-particle pictures can be generated
using Hedin’s equations. However, a consistent solution of Hedin’s equations is a formidable task.
Here, we considered a simpliﬁed set of equations. Notably the GW0-approximation, mainly used
in solid state physics, has been shown to lead to sensible results also in the ﬁeld of plasma physics.
Results for the self-energy and the spectral function are presented. Plasmon-like structures, present
[47] vanish completely. An asymmetrically
in perturbative calculations as performed in Ref.
broadened and shifted spectral function is obtained. Furthermore, it is shown, that a simpliﬁed
model, where the dynamically screened interaction is approximated by static screening leads to
similar results for both self-energy and spectral function as compared to the full RPA results.
Deviations can be understood as a consequence of neglecting collisions among particles of equal
species.

The simpliﬁed GW 0 approximation for plasmas is now available for a broad range of parame-
ters, i.e. density and temperature. Also, the correct asymptotic behaviour, i.e. convergence to a
delta-like quasiparticle resonance at large momenta, is obtained. In this paper we used parameters
[21] contains similar results for lower density and
corresponding to the solar core, whereas Ref.
temperature.

Vertex corrections to the self-energy have been studied on a perturbative level. So far, only
the high frequency behaviour of the exchange diagram second order in the screened interaction
was evaluated. It leads to 20% reduction of the self-energy with respect to the second order of
GW 0.

The availability of the one-particle spectral function for any momentum and frequency makes
it possible to use it in calculations of further physical observables as the equation of state and
the optical properties. Here we focused on the absorption of electromagnetic radiation due to
free-free transitions, which is obtained from the polarization function. Insertion of the broadened
particle propagators in the one-loop approximation for Π leads to a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the
absorption spectrum at low frequencies. Besides the suppression in the infrared, enhancement of
absorption is observed at intermediate frequencies.

Since the one-loop approximation using full propagators is an inconsistent approximation with
regards to conservation laws, such as Ward identities, we investigated the vertex-correction inside
the polarization loop in lowest order.
It turned out, that the vertex correction is by far the
most important correction to Born approximation, i.e. the self-energy eﬀects contained in the
full spectral functions, are dominated by the vertex correction. However, this is not a general
feature as becomes clear if comparing to calculations for other parameters in Ref.
[21]. On the
other hand, a consistent comparison of both self-energy and vertex corrections on the same level of
approximation necessitates the summation of vertex-corrections by solution of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation (5). This task will be accomplished in the future.

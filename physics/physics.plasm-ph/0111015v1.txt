Abstract

Generation of wake ﬁelds by a short electromagnetic pulse in a plasma
with an inhomogeneous background magnetic ﬁeld and density proﬁle is
considered, and a wave equation is derived. Transmission and reﬂection
coeﬃcients are calculated in a medium with sharp discontinuities. Par-
ticular attention is focused on examples where the longitudinal part of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld is ampliﬁed for the transmitted wave. Further-
more, it is noted that the wake ﬁeld can propagate out of the plasma and
thereby provide information about the electron density proﬁle. A method
for reconstructing the background density proﬁle from a measured wake
ﬁeld spectrum is proposed and a numerical example is given.

1 Introduction

As is well-known, a short electromagnetic (EM) pulse propagating in an un-
derdense unmagnetized plasma can excite a wake ﬁeld of plasma oscillations
(Tajima and Dawson 1979; Gorbunov and Kirsanov 1987). This has interesting
applications to plasma based particle accelerators (Dawson 1994), photon accel-
eration (Wilks et al 1989; Mironov et al 1992; Mendonca 2001) and is naturally
of importance for the general understanding of the interactions between plas-
mas and radiation. If the plasma is magnetized and the external magnetic ﬁeld
non-parallel to the direction of propagation of the exciting pulse, the wake ﬁeld
becomes partially electromagnetic and thereby obtains a nonzero group velocity
(Brodin and Lundberg 1998).

In the present paper we study wake ﬁeld generation and propagation in an
inhomogeneous magnetized plasma. A wave equation for the wake ﬁeld, includ-
ing arbitrary inhomogeneities in the particle number density and magnetic ﬁeld,
is derived from the cold electron ﬂuid equations and the propagation properties
are investigated. We address two questions in particular. Firstly, we exam-
ine the eﬀect of a strong inhomogeneity on the wake ﬁeld, by introducing a

1

discontinuity in the background magnetic ﬁeld and density. The longitudinal
part of the electric ﬁeld of the transmitted wave can be largely ampliﬁed when
the ratio between the group velocities of the transmitted and incident wave is
small. The ampliﬁcation factor for the longitudinal electric ﬁeld is given and
analyzed as well as the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients. Secondly, we
consider to what extent the wake ﬁeld can propagate out of the plasma, and
thereby provide information about the background plasma parameters. Since
the wake ﬁeld initially has the frequency equal to the local plasma frequency
also in the magnetized case, this provides a way of extracting information about
the background electron density proﬁle, i.e. the proﬁle in absence of the wake
ﬁeld density oscillations. It turns out that even though wave overtaking – for
example when a higher frequency part of the wake ﬁeld passes a lower frequency
part – may occur, the density proﬁle can still be reconstructed by integrating the
ray equations of geometric optics backwards. A numerical example is provided,
where the predicted spectrum of the wake ﬁeld corresponding to an assumed
density proﬁle is shown, and a reconstructed proﬁle is calculated.

The paper is organized as follows: After stating the equations governing the
wake ﬁeld in section 2, we derive the wave equation for the longitudinal electric
ﬁeld in section 3. The excitation and propagation in a weakly inhomogeneous
medium are examined in section 4. Then, in section 5, the eﬀects of strong
inhomogeneities on the wake ﬁeld, which for example causes ﬁeld ampliﬁcation
and reﬂection, are studied. Next, in section 6, the spectral properties of an
electromagnetically generated wake ﬁeld from a nonuniform density proﬁle are
investigated. An algorithm for reconstructing the density proﬁle from a mea-
sured wake ﬁeld spectrum is given and illustrated with a numerical example.
Finally, the results are summarized and discussed in section 7.

2 Basic equations

We consider a high frequency EM pulse with frequency ωH propagating in a
cold, inhomogeneous magnetized plasma. We assume the ordering ωH ≫ ωp, ωc,
where ωp and ωc ≡ |qB0|/m are the plasma and electron cyclotron frequency
x is
respectively, q and m are the electron charge and mass, and B0 = B0
the external magnetic ﬁeld. We let the EM pulse propagate perpendicularly
to the external magnetic ﬁeld. The ponderomotive force of the EM pulse will
generate a “low frequency” wake ﬁeld mode (which is the low frequency branch
of the extraordinary mode, or plasma oscillations modiﬁed by the magnetic ﬁeld,
depending on the choice of terminology) during its path through the plasma.
The generation mechanism is most eﬃcient if the pulse has a duration of the
order of the inverse plasma frequency or shorter so that the ion-motion can be
omitted. In principle, the EM pulse will broaden due to ordinary dispersion,
decrease its energy and frequency due to the interaction with the wake ﬁeld,
etc. These and other eﬀects have been considered in homogeneous plasmas by
for example Brodin and Lundberg (1998). We will focus on the propagation
properties of the wake ﬁeld, however, and for this purpose it turns out that we

b

can forget about the details of the EM pulse. Basically the eﬀect of the EM
ﬁeld is to provide a well localized ponderomotive source term in the governing
equations for the wake ﬁeld, travelling with almost the speed of light in vacuum.
The wake ﬁeld quantities are denoted by index L. We introduce the cor-
responding vector and scalar potentials AL(z, t) and φL(z, t), using Coulomb
gauge, and the electron density is written n = n0(z, t)+ nL(z, t), where n0 is the
unperturbed density. Furthermore, the electron ﬂuid velocity v is divided into
its high- and low frequency part, and we denote the low frequency contributions
perpendicular and parallel to the direction of propagation with vL⊥ and vLz re-
spectively. The ponderomotive force of the EM pulse induces longitudinal wake
y -direction through the Lorentz-
ﬁeld motion, which couple to motion in the
force, but there is no wake ﬁeld motion in the direction of the external magnetic
y. Linearizing in the
ﬁeld, and accordingly we put AL = AL
low frequency variables we obtain the following set of equations governing the
wake ﬁeld generation and propagation

4 Wake ﬁeld excitation and propagation

We will consider wake ﬁeld propagation in both strongly and weakly inhomoge-
neous plasmas. By weakly inhomogeneous we mean that the wavelength of the
wake ﬁeld is much smaller than the characteristic inhomogeneity length scale.
Then, to lowest order, derivatives acting on background quantities can be ne-
glected and the wave equation reduces to Eq. (10) with a space and possibly

approximation cannot be applied, and the time evolution of the wake ﬁeld is
given by Eq. (9). In this section only weakly inhomogeneous plasmas will be
considered, and it is illustrative to divide our study of the wake ﬁeld properties
into its excitation and its propagation phase. However, we note that the ex-
citation process considered below will also be of relevance for the next section
concerning strongly inhomogeneous plasmas, since in that case we will deal with
wake ﬁelds generated in a weakly inhomogeneous plasma that propagates into a
strongly inhomogeneous region.

4.1 Excitation

The excitation of one additional wavelength of the wake ﬁeld takes place during
a distance of the order of 2πc/ωp, and – as a basic assumption of ours – the
variations of n0 is negligible on this length scale. Thus as far as the excitation
process is concerned, the plasma can essentially be treated as homogeneous. The
solution for the wake ﬁeld can thus be obtained from previous authors (Brodin
and Lundberg 1998). Changing to co-moving coordinates ξ = z − vgH t, τ = t,
where vgH is the group velocity of the high frequency EM pulse, in Eq. (10) and

result here, for our purposes, is the determination of the initial value of the wake
ﬁeld wave number kp = ωp/vgH , which corresponds to an initial frequency ωp
(in the laboratory frame). Note that this wake ﬁeld frequency will in general
vary with the position of generation.

4.2 Propagation

In a weakly inhomogeneous plasma the wavelength of the wake ﬁeld is much
smaller than the characteristic inhomogeneity length scale. The wake ﬁeld prop-
erties can thus be considered as locally uniform but globally nonuniform, and
therefore we make the ansatz of geometrical optics (Whitham 1974)

ψ = ψ0(z, t)eiθ(z,t)

The local wavenumber and frequency are deﬁned in terms of the eikonal θ(z, t)
as k ≡ ∂zθ and ω ≡ −∂tθ, respectively and the amplitude ψ0(z, t) is assumed to
vary slowly with z and t. The local dispersion relation follows then, as a lowest
order approximation, from Eq. (10)

p)1/2]. The dispersion relation
2 [−ωc + (ω2
2 [ωc + (ω2
has two positive roots. One branch is valid for ω > ωR and one for ωL < ω < ωh.
As the wake ﬁeld is generated with the local plasma frequency ωp, the wake ﬁeld
must belong to the latter branch. Therefore we write the dispersion relation
from now on as

where χ ≡ (ω2

explicit expressions for the wavenumber and group velocity vg ≡ ∂kω that we
will use later. They are

From the geometric optics approach there follows useful transport equations

that

where d/dt ≡ ∂t + vg∂z. Eqs. (17) are referred to as the ray equations. Note
that for a time-independent medium, the right hand side of the last equation is
zero, and the wake ﬁeld propagates with the local wake ﬁeld group velocity vg
and with unchanged frequency.

Since the group velocity may vary along the rays, the energy carried with
the wake ﬁeld can be compressed as well as attenuated, and from energy con-
servation one may expect the ﬁeld amplitude to vary correspondingly, see e.g.
Mendonca (2001) for similar eﬀects for ordinary electromagnetic waves in plas-
mas. The extraordinary mode, however, has several degrees of freedom that the
energy may vary between, depending on variations in the background parame-
ters. Therefore the behavior of the amplitudes are not in direct correspondence
with the variation of the group velocity. For completeness and for future refer-
ence we state the linear relations between the ﬁeld variables and ψ that follows
from Eqs. (1)-(5) in the weakly inhomogeneous approximation

5 Reﬂection and transmission properties

We now consider the eﬀect of a strongly inhomogeneous region on the wake
ﬁeld. We assume that the wake ﬁeld entering this region was generated in a
weakly inhomogeneous part of the plasma. Thus the wake ﬁeld can be taken
to be uniform when entering the inhomogeneous region, and the variations in
the wake ﬁeld frequency ω can be neglected. During these conditions we have
t ψ = −ω2ψ and, away from the exciting electromagnetic pulse, the wave

equation (9) reduces to an ordinary diﬀerential equation

Although it is straight forward, at least numerically, to solve Eq. (23) for any
given background density and magnetic ﬁeld, we simplify the analysis by treating
the inhomogeneity as a discontinuity, in order to clearly illustrate some of the
main eﬀects associated with a strong inhomogeneity. We let the discontinuity
be located at z = 0, and the remaining plasma is assumed to be homogeneous.
Thus we can make the following ansatz for the wake ﬁeld

ψ1 = ψiei(k1z−ωt) + ψrei(−k1z−ωt)
ψ2 = ψtei(k2z−ωt)

,
,

z < 0
z > 0

(24)

where ω = ωp1. This ansatz does not apply if we are too close to the exciting
pulse, or for the ﬁelds that were generated in the strongly inhomogeneous re-
gion, but both these parts of the wake ﬁeld are assumed to be distant to the
discontinuity. The subscripts i, r and t stands for the incident, reﬂected and
transmitted part, respectively, and the indices 1 and 2 distinguishes quantities
on the left (z < 0) and right (z > 0) hand side of the discontinuity.

By integrating Eq. (23) across z = 0, it follows that αψ and ∂z(αψ) are
continuous over the discontinuity. We deﬁne r = ψr/ψi and a = ψt/ψi, and we
refer to these quantities as the ampliﬁcation factors for the reﬂected and trans-
mitted part of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld, which essentially are generalized
Fresnel coeﬃcients. The continuity conditions and the ansatz (24) imply

where α1 and α2 are the values of α on the left and right hand side of the
discontinuity, respectively, and

It follows from Eq. (23) that

is – averaged in time and space – a conserved quantity, i.e. ∂zS = 0. (Noting
that S is the time and space averaged z-component of the Poynting vector
2 [E × B∗ + E∗ × B], this also follows directly from energy conservation.
S ≡ 1
Actually from Eq. (23) it ﬁrstly follows that the conserved quantity is equal to
kα2|ψ|2. To see that this is equivalent to Eq. (27) requires tedious but straight
forward algebra.)

R =

(28)

(29)

and they satisfy the energy conservation law T + R = 1.

The quantities a, r, T and R depends on the four parameters ωp1, ωp2, ωc1
and ωc2. We choose ωp1 = ωc2 = 1 (in normalized units) and, rather than
presenting complicated surface plots, present one dimensional graphs of the
dependence of a, r, T and R on ωc2 for some given values of ωp2, and vice versa.
Fig. 1 shows T (ωc2), R(ωc2) and vg2 for distinct values of ωp2, and Fig. 2 shows
T (ωp2), R(ωp2) and vg2 for distinct values of ωc2. As can be seen, for most of the
parameter regime the transmission is close to unity. There are also regions of no
propagation in Fig. 2, corresponding to parameter values ωh2 < ω < ωR2. Close
to these regions the transmission quickly goes to zero and the reﬂection towards
unity, because the wave approaches a resonance or a cut-oﬀ. The regions to the
left in Fig. 1a and 2a corresponds to the branch ω > ωR2, i.e. the transmitted
mode belongs to a diﬀerent branch of the dispersion relation (13) than the
incident mode.

In Fig. 1a, where ωp2 = 0.5, the left part stretches until ωc2 ≈ 0.71 where
the ωR cut-oﬀ prohibits transmission. At ωc2 ≈ 0.87, T and vg2 becomes zero
because of the ωh resonance. Fig. 1b is the special case for a jump in the
magnetic ﬁeld only, i.e. ωp2 = 1. The transmission is everywhere unity although
the group velocity approaches zero with diminishing ωc2.
In Fig. 1c, where
ωp2 = 2, there is no transmission up to ωc2 = 3 which is due to the ωL cut-oﬀ.
In Fig. 2a, 2b and 2c the values of ωc2 are 0.5, 1 and 2, respectively. In Fig.
2a the ωR cut-oﬀ occurs at ωp2 ≈ 0.71, the ωh resonance at ωp2 ≈ 0.87 and the
ωL cut-oﬀ at ωp2 ≈ 1.22. In both Fig 2b and 2c the absence of transmission is
due to the ωL cut-oﬀ.

The special cases Fig. 1b and 2b are particularly interesting, representing a
jump in the magnetic ﬁeld only (referred to as case I below) and in the density
only (referred to as case II below). The transmission remains unity although
the group velocity goes to zero as ωc2 → 0 (Fig. 1b) and ωp2 → 0 (Fig. 2b).
This means that the energy density entering from region 1 will be dramatically
ampliﬁed in region 2. The question is to which ﬁeld variables this energy will
be concentrated.

Case I. For ωp2 = ωp1 = 1 the ampliﬁcation factor for ψ is displayed in Fig.
3a together with vg and vph. The ampliﬁcation factor reduces to a = ωc1/ωc2. It
should be emphasized that the wavenumber is preserved over the discontinuity
and thus also the phase velocity, that equals c, is preserved. This property is,
however, very sensitive to small deviations from exactly constant density. This
In
is illustrated in Fig. 3b, where ωp2 = 0.99, and 3c, where ωp2 = 1.01.

8

these cases the longitudinal ﬁeld can still be ampliﬁed, but not by a large factor
without also aﬀecting the phase velocity substantially.

Case II. In the case of uniform magnetic ﬁeld, ωc2 = ωc1 = 1, the ﬁeld
variable that is ampliﬁed is the perpendicular electron ﬂuid velocity v⊥. This
can be seen by evaluating v⊥2/v⊥1 using Eq. (19) and the ampliﬁcation factor
(25). This case does not share the property with case I of preserved phase
velocity over the discontinuity.
In Fig. 2b we have added a small deviation
to ωc so that ωc2 = 1.005 to illustrate that the group velocity can be made
arbitrarily small. But, in the limit ωp2 → 0 the group velocity approaches c, as
required in vacuum.

6 Density proﬁle reconstruction

A wake ﬁeld generated by a short EM pulse in an underdense magnetized plasma
q2n0/ǫ0m. Due
has the frequency equal to the local plasma frequency, ωp =
to the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld it has a nonzero group velocity, and for
suitable background parameter proﬁles cut-oﬀs and resonances in the plasma
are avoided and thus the wake ﬁeld can propagate out of the plasma. This
suggests the possibility of gaining information of the density proﬁle n0(z) from
studying the wake ﬁeld exiting the plasma.

p

We assume that the plasma is weakly inhomogeneous so that the results
in section 4.1 and 4.2 can be applied. Given the ray equations, one may –
conceptually speaking – treat the wake ﬁeld as consisting of particles, “photons”
(dressed photons, that is), created at diﬀerent times, as the EM pulse plows
through the plasma. The “photons” have distinct frequencies, depending on the
position they were “created”, and thus also diﬀerent propagation velocity, vg.
The equation of motion for the “photons” are Eq. (16) and the ray equations,
Eq. (17). The exact evolution of the wake ﬁeld, on the other hand, is more
complicated. This can be understood from that “photons” created at later times
may be overtaken by “photons” created at earlier times. For our purposes the
particle-picture is to prefer.

We assume that the generated wake ﬁeld spectrum is measured immediately
outside the plasma boundary. In consistence with the geometric optics approx-
imation we will treat the measured data as a weakly time dependent spectrum
with well deﬁned sharp (quasi-monochromatic) peaks. Because of overtaking
“photons”, the data is not necessarily monochromatic at a given time, multiple
sharp peaks may occur in the spectrum. Generally, we can express the data as
a set of distinct frequencies measured at diﬀerent times, in which case a sharp
curve can be recognized, see Fig. 4. Due to cut-oﬀs and/or resonances, the
curve may be discontinuous.

Given a measured wake ﬁeld spectrum, as in Fig. 4, the density proﬁle can be
reconstructed the following way. Discretize the frequency curve into N points
ω(0), ω(1), ..., ω(N ) with corresponding time of detection t(0), t(1), ..., t(N ). The
plasma is discretized into N cells whose positions, z(0), z(1), ..., z(N ) and width
are yet to be determined. The “photon” with frequency ω(N ), detected at time

9

t(N ), was the last one to exit the plasma. Therefore the plasma frequency in
the cell at z(N ) has the value ω(N ). Next, we retrace the “photon” ω(N −1)
backwards into the plasma to a position z(N −1) consistent with the time of
detection t(N −1) and the equation of motions through the already reconstructed
cell. The plasma frequency in the cell with position z(N −1) is assigned the value
ω(N −1). The third “photon” ω(N −2) is retraced through the cells with plasma
frequency ω(N ) and ω(N −1) to a position z(N −2) and assigns the corresponding
cell there the plasma frequency ω(N −2). This procedure is repeated for all
“photons” along the frequency curve.

In order to demonstrate the method we numerically calculate a wake ﬁeld
spectrum from an assumed density proﬁle, using the ray equations, see Fig.5(a),
and treat this as experimental data from which the density proﬁle can be re-
constructed. We consider a plasma magnetized such that ωc = 1.1 × ωp,max,
where ωp,max is the maximum value of the plasma frequency. For simplicity we
normalize such that L = 1, c = 1, where L is the length of the plasma, and let
the EM pulse enter the plasma at t = 0 and exit at t = 1.

Retracing the spectrum according to the algorithm presented above results
in a density proﬁle that can be compared with the one we assumed, see Fig.
5(b). A small numerical error – that can be removed with a ﬁner discretization
– can be seen. Note that the entire plasma proﬁle cannot be reconstructed.
The left most points in Fig. 2(b) are missing. This is because the wake ﬁeld
generated in this region of low density cannot propagate through the plasma
since there is a cut-oﬀ prohibiting this. The information of this region is already
missing in the wake ﬁeld spectrum.

7 Summary and discussion

We have considered the propagation of wake ﬁelds generated by a short, high
frequency EM pulse in an inhomogeneous magnetized plasma. A general wave
equation for the wake ﬁeld driven by the ponderomotive force of the high fre-
quency pulse has been derived, Eq. (9), and the propagation properties have
been investigated. If the wake ﬁeld enters a strongly inhomogeneous region it
may be largely ampliﬁed. The ampliﬁcation factor for the longitudinal electric
ﬁeld and transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients have been derived and analyzed
for a discontinuity in the magnetic ﬁeld and/or the particle number density. In
the case of uniform density the ampliﬁcation factor becomes a = ωc1/ωc2. This
special case is also characterized by the fact that there is no reﬂection and the
phase velocity of the transmitted wave remains equal to the velocity of light.
This result may be of relevance for particle and photon accelerators based on
wake ﬁelds. For applications like particle acceleration, it might be desirable
to ﬁnally let the ampliﬁed wake ﬁeld propagate in an unmagnetized plasma.
Simply eliminating the external magnetic ﬁeld once the wake ﬁeld is ampliﬁed
aﬀects the frequency and thus the phase velocity in accordance with the ray
equations (17). It seems straightforward, however, to match the discontinuity
and the elimination of the magnetic ﬁeld so that the phase velocity of the re-

10

sulting ﬁeld is approximately equal to c, which is the desirable value for particle
acceleration purposes.

Furthermore, the spectral properties of a wake ﬁeld from a plasma with
nonuniform density have been investigated and a method for reconstructing
the density proﬁle from a measured wake ﬁeld spectrum has been proposed
and illustrated with a numerical example. This result shows that wake ﬁelds
generated by a high frequency EM pulse in principle can be used as a diagnostic
tool, in magnetized plasmas. The proposed method is based on a mechanism
substantially diﬀerent from those of existing techniques, such as interferometry
and reﬂectometry (Hartfuss 1998; Hutchinson 1987). It should be possible to
extend the method to plasmas where the background density varies in time by
using sequential EM pulses. The most interesting case is that of a strongly
magnetized plasma (i.e. when the electron cyclotron frequency is larger than
the plasma frequency), for which almost all of the wake ﬁeld energy - except that
generated in a narrow low density region - may propagate out of the plasma.
The requirement that the length scales of inhomogeneities must be larger than
the local plasma wave length λp ≡ 2πvgH /ωp for the results to be valid means
that it can resolve inhomogeneities of the order 108n−1/2m and larger, where n
is the electron number density in units m−3.

A Suydam-unstable circular cylinder of plasma with periodic boundary conditions in the axial
direction is studied within the approximation of linearized ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
The normal mode equations are completely separable, so both the toroidal Fourier harmonic index
n and the poloidal index m are good quantum numbers. The full spectrum of eigenvalues in the
range 1 ≤ m ≤ mmax is analyzed quantitatively, using asymptotics for large m, numerics for all
m, and graphics for qualitative understanding. The density of eigenvalues scales like m2
max as
mmax → ∞. Because ﬁnite-m corrections scale as 1/m2
max, their inclusion is essential in order to
obtain the correct statistics for the distribution of eigenvalues. Near the largest growth rate only a
single radial eigenmode contributes to the spectrum, so the eigenvalues there depend only on m and
n as in a two-dimensional system. However, unlike the generic separable two-dimensional system,
the statistics of the ideal-MHD spectrum departs somewhat from the Poisson distribution, even for
arbitrarily large mmax. This departure from Poissonian statistics may be understood qualitatively
from the nature of the distribution of rational numbers in the rotational transform proﬁle.

INTRODUCTION

The general aim of this paper is to compare and con-
trast the spectrum of eigenvalues in typical integrable
wave systems (e.g. waves in a rectangular cavity [1])
with the spectrum of instabilities in a cylindrical plasma
within the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approx-
imation. This is a ﬁrst step in understanding the spec-
tral problem in the complex three-dimensional geometry
of the class of magnetic conﬁnement fusion experiments
known as stellarators [2].

In ideal MHD the spectrum of the frequencies, ω, of
normal modes of displacements about a toroidal equilib-
rium is diﬃcult to characterize mathematically because
the linearized force operator is not compact [3]. In ad-
dition to a point (discrete) spectrum of unstable modes
(ω2 < 0) there are the Alfv´en and slow-magnetosonic
continuous spectra on the stable side of the origin (ω2 >
0) and the possibility of dense sets of accumulation points
on the unstable side. In mathematical spectral theory the
stable continua and unstable accumulation “continua” [4]
are characterized [5] as belonging to the essential spec-
trum. (For a self-adjoint operator L, the essential spec-
λ
trum is the set of λ-values for which the range of L

−

is not a closed set and/or the dimensionality of the null
space of L

λ is inﬁnite.)

There is experimental evidence that ideal MHD is rel-
evant in interpreting experimental results [6, 7], but per-
haps the greatest virtue of ideal MHD in fusion plasma
physics is its mathematical tractability as a ﬁrst-cut
for assessing the stability of proposed fusion-
model
relevant experiments with complicated geometries in the
pre-design phase.

For this purpose a substantial investment in eﬀort has
been expended on developing numerical matrix eigen-
value programs, such as the three-dimensional TERPSI-
CHORE [8] and CAS3D [9] codes. These solve the MHD
wave equations for perturbations about static equilibria,
so that the eigenvalue ω2 is real due to the Hermitic-
ity (self-adjointness [10]) of the linearized force and ki-
netic energy operators. They use ﬁnite-element or ﬁnite-
diﬀerence methods to convert the inﬁnite-dimensional
PDE eigenvalue problem to an approximating ﬁnite-
dimensional matrix problem. An alternative approach is
to use local analysis using the ballooning representation
and to attempt semiclassical quantization to estimate the
global spectrum [11, 12, 13].

In order properly to verify the convergence of these
codes in three-dimensional geometry it is essential to un-
derstand the nature of the spectrum—if it is quantum-
chaotic then convergence of individual eigenvalues cannot
be expected and a statistical description must be used

[14, 15, 16, 17].

This is perhaps of most importance in understanding
the spectrum in three-dimensional magnetic conﬁnement
geometries, in particular the various stellarator exper-
iments currently running or under construction. These
devices are called three-dimensional because they possess
no continuous geometrical symmetries, and thus there is
no separation of variables to reduce the dimensionality
of the eigenvalue problem. It has been shown [18] that
the semiclassical limit (a Hamiltonian ray tracing prob-
lem) for ballooning instabilities in such geometries may
be strongly chaotic because there are no ignorable coor-
dinates in the ray Hamiltonian.

However, the present paper discusses the opposite
limit, a system with a suﬃcient number of symmetries
to make the ray Hamiltonian integrable and the eigen-
value problem separable. The geometry is the circular
cylinder, periodic in the z-direction to make it topolog-
ically toroidal—we shall refer to the z-direction as the
toroidal direction and the azimuthal, θ-direction as the
poloidal direction. The study of this separable system
will provide a baseline for comparison with the three-
dimensional toroidal case in future work. The overall
goal of the paper is to determine if the ideal-MHD spec-
trum falls within the same universality class as that of
typical waves in separable geometries or, if not, what
might cause it to diﬀer.

Berry and Tabor [19] show that the distribution func-
tion P (s) for the spacing of adjacent energy levels (suit-
ably scaled) in a generic separable quantum system with
more than one degree of freedom is exp(
s), as for a
Poisson process with levels distributed at random. They
also show that the spectrum of uncoupled quantum os-
cillators is nongeneric even when the frequency ratios
are not commensurate, in which case P (s) peaks about
a nonzero value of s (as also occurs in nonintegrable,
chaotic systems—the “level repulsion” eﬀect). A more
surprising departure from the Poisson distribution was
found by Casati et al. [1] for waves in a rectangular box
with irrational aspect ratio, but the departure was very
small. Level spacing statistics are discussed also in the
standard monographs on quantum chaos [14, 15, 16, 17].
In contrast with quantum mechanics, where the contin-
uous spectrum arises from the unboundedness of conﬁg-
uration space, the ideal-MHD essential spectrum arises
from the unboundedness of Fourier space—there is no
minimum wavelength. This is an unphysical artifact of
the ideal MHD model because, in reality, low-frequency
instabilities with
much greater than the ion Lar-
mor radius, ai, cannot exist (where k⊥ is the projection
of the local wavevector into the plane perpendicular to
the magnetic ﬁeld B). Indeed, ideal MHD breaks down

in various ways at large
, with dissipative and drift

eﬀects coming into play.

In this paper we do not attempt to model ﬁnite-
Larmor-radius stabilization, but instead simply restrict
the poloidal mode spectrum to m
mmax and study
the scaling of the spectrum at large mmax. The nature

≤

2

of the dispersion relation is such that the toroidal mode
numbers n relevant to the spectrum are also restricted.
In a matrix eigenvalue code such as CAS3D or TERP-
SICHORE our procedure corresponds to using an arbi-
trarily ﬁne radial mesh but truncating the toroidal and
poloidal basis set.

The eigenvalue equation for a reduced MHD model of
a stellarator is presented in Sec. II. We study a plasma
in which the Suydam criterion [20] for the stability of
interchange modes is violated, so the number of unstable
modes is inﬁnite.

Section III is devoted to developing an understand-
ing of the dependence (the dispersion relation) of the
eigenvalues on the radial, poloidal and toroidal mode
numbers, l, m, and n, respectively. As m and n ap-
n/m ﬁxed, the growth-rate
proach inﬁnity, keeping µ
≡
eigenvalues asymptote to a constant, the Suydam growth
rate, depending only on µ and the radial mode number l.
We use a combination of perturbation expansion in 1/m
and numerical solution of the eigenvalue equation using
a new transformation to Schr¨odinger form that is appli-
cable over the whole range of m, from O(1) to
. This
generalizes the approach of Cheremhykh and Revenchuk
Suydam eigen-
[21], which was limited to the m =
value problem. We compare some of the asymptotic re-
sults in [21] with our numerical solutions. Our perturba-
tion expansion shows that the correction to the Suydam
limit goes as 1/m2. Contrary to usual experience [22],
our numerical solutions show that the growth rates do
not always approach the Suydam values from below as
m

.
→ ∞
In Sec. IV we examine the part of the spectrum in-
volving the most unstable modes, which is essentially
two-dimensional because only the lowest-order radial
mode, l = 0, contributes. We relate the considerable
amount of structure observed in the spectrum to the
Farey sequences of rational values of the rotational trans-
form (winding number) of the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld.
Low-order rationals have associated eigenvalue sequences
giving a regular distribution of eigenvalues locally more
like the spectrum of a one-dimensional system than a
two-dimensional one.

In Sec. V we derive the analog of the Weyl formula
for the average density of states, including an asymptotic
analysis of the large-l limit. In Sec. VI we show level spac-
ing distributions P (s). Since we are interested in large m
we ﬁrst try approximating the eigenvalues by their cor-
responding asymptotic Suydam limit. This gives a very
singular distribution with a delta-function-like spike at
the origin [23] due to the extremely degenerate nature
of the spectrum in this approximation. By contrast the
distribution for the exact spectrum has no spike at the
origin, showing that the small 1/m2 corrections break the
degeneracy suﬃciently to completely change the statis-
tics.

We examine the statistics for the l = 0 and l = 1 spec-
tra, both individually and combined (in the low-growth-
rate region where they overlap). We have examined suﬃ-

ciently large data sets to show convincingly that the sta-
tistical distributions are not Poissonian, though that of
the combined l = 0 and l = 1 spectrum is closest. We also
split the l = 0 spectrum into two halves to remove over-
lap of spectra arising from diﬀerent parts of the plasma.
These split spectra exhibit a much more dramatic depar-
ture from Poisson statistics, showing that the ideal-MHD
interchange spectrum is indeed nongeneric in the sense of
Berry and Tabor [19].

II. CHOICE OF MODEL EIGENVALUE

The grand context of

the three-
dimensional linearized ideal MHD problem—to solve, un-
der appropriate boundary conditions, the equation of mo-
tion

for small displacements ξ(r, t) of the MHD ﬂuid about
a static equilibrium state, where ρ(r) is the equilibrium
mass density, r is position, t is time, and F is a Hermi-
tian linearized force operator [10] under the inner product
d3x ξ∗·F·ξ and suitable boundary conditions. (Super-
script * denotes complex conjugation—we can take ξ to
R
be complex because all the coeﬃcients in F are real, so
the real and imaginary parts of ξ obey the same equa-
tion.)

Most modern magnetic conﬁnement fusion experi-
ments,
in particular tokamaks and stellarators, are
toroidal. Though not guaranteed for arbitrary three-
dimensional systems, the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld B(r)
is normally assumed to be integrable in the sense that
all ﬁeld lines lie on invariant tori (magnetic surfaces)
nested about a single closed ﬁeld line (the magnetic axis).
Within each toroidal magnetic surface a natural angular
coordinate system is set up, with the poloidal angle θ
increasing by 2π for each circuit around the short way
and the toroidal angle ζ increasing by 2π for each circuit
the long way. Each surface is characterized by a mag-
netic winding number, the rotational transform ι-, being
the average poloidal rotation of a ﬁeld line per toroidal
, over an inﬁnite number of circuits. (In
circuit,
i
1/ι-, is normally used as
tokamak physics the inverse, q
the rotation number.)

In this paper we study an eﬀectively circular-
cylindrical MHD equilibrium, using cylindrical coordi-
nates such that the magnetic axis coincides with the z-
axis, made topologically toroidal by periodic boundary
conditions. Thus z and the toroidal angle ζ are related
through ζ
z/R0, where R0 is the major radius of the
toroidal plasma being modeled by this cylinder. The
poloidal angle θ is the usual geometric cylindrical an-
gle and the distance r from the magnetic axis labels the
magnetic surfaces (the equilibrium ﬁeld being trivially
integrable in this case). The plasma edge is at r = a.

In the cylinder there are two ignorable coordinates, θ
and ζ, so the components of ξ are completely factorizable
into products of functions of the independent variables
separately. In particular, we write the r-component as

rξr = exp(imθ) exp(

inζ)ϕ(r) ,

where the periodic boundary conditions quantize m and
n to integers and we choose to work with the stream
function ϕ(r)

rξr(r).

Since the primary motivation of this paper is stellara-
tor physics, we use the reduced MHD ordering for large-
aspect stellarators [2, 24], averaging over helical ripple
to reduce to an equivalent cylindrical problem [25, 26].
The universality class should be insensitive to the precise
choice of model as long as it exhibits the behavior typical
of MHD instabilities in a cylindrical plasma, speciﬁcally
the existence of interchange instabilities and the occur-
rence of accumulation points at ﬁnite growth rates.

We nondimensionalize by measuring the radius r in
units of the minor radius of the plasma column, a, and
the time t in units of the poloidal Alfv´en time τA =
R0√µ0ρ/B0, where B0 is the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld and
µ0 is the permeability of free space. Thus ω is in units of

by interchanging ﬁeld lines, thus driving the interchange

We observe some diﬀerences between Eq. (3) and the
standard quantum mechanical eigenvalue problem Hψ =
Eψ. One is of course the physical interpretation of the
eigenvalue—in quantum mechanics the eigenvalue E
≡
~ω is linear in the frequency because the Schr¨odinger
equation is ﬁrst order in time, whereas our eigenvalue λ
is quadratic in the frequency because it derives from a
classical equation of motion.

Another diﬀerence is that Eq. (3) is a generalized eigen-
value equation because M is not the identity operator.
This is one reason why it is necessary to treat the MHD
spectrum explicitly rather than simply assume it is in the
same universality class as standard quantum mechanical
systems.

Just as in ordinary eigenvalue problems the eigenvalue
spectrum for the generalized eigenvalue problem is real,
and the eigenfunctions ϕi have a generalized orthogonal-
ity property

Equation (3) is very similar to the normal mode equa-

ﬁnding the highest growth rate, but in characterizing the
complete set of unstable eigenvalues.

In this section we discuss the standard unregularized
ideal MHD spectrum. It is well known that for λ > 0
the spectrum consists of the Alfv´en continuum (the slow-
magnetosonic continuum being removed in reduced MHD

something about the function ι-(r). The typical proﬁle
of ι-(r) in a stellarator is monotonically increasing in the

here (though it is not always true in modern stellarators).

As is seen from Fig. 3, Eq. (21) gives a remarkably
good approximation to the growth rate of the most un-
stable radial eigenmode, l = 0, and Eq. (20) gives a good
approximation for the higher-l modes (the semiclassical
quantization being strictly justiﬁable only for large l).
The growth-rate maxima for each l occur close to the
maximum of G (and hence Γ), but not exactly owing to
the ˙ι- factor in the deﬁnition Γ

γ/˙ι-(rµ).

From Eq. (21) we see that, provided the Suydam cri-
terion G > 1/4 is satisﬁed, there is an inﬁnity of growth
rate eigenvalues accumulating exponentially toward the
origin from above (so the λ-values accumulate from be-
low) in the limit l

Perhaps less widely appreciated (because m and n are
normally taken to be ﬁxed) is the fact that there is also a
point of accumulation of the eigenvalues of Eq. (3) at each

of λ(0) we must proceed further with the expansion in

tion goes through much as in standard time-independent
quantum perturbation theory [28, e.g.].

The lowest order eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are, as
found in Sec. III B, λ(0) = λµ,l and ϕ(0) = ϕµ,l(x), respec-
tively. The O(1/m) correction, λ(1), vanishes identically
from parity considerations—ϕµ,l(x) is either an even or
odd function so its contribution to the matrix elements
of L(1) and M (1) between ϕ(0) and ϕ(0) is even. On the
other hand, L(1) and M (1) are odd, so λ(1)
0. (This
contrasts with the ﬁnite-aspect-ratio toroidal case where
toroidal coupling of Fourier harmonics of diﬀerent m to
form ballooning modes leads to a nonvanishing 1/n cor-
rection [29, 30].)

m and n are integers and µmin and µmax are chosen to
give the desired range of γ. As we shall be rescaling the
eigenvalues prior to statistical analysis, it makes no dif-
ference whether we work with the spectrum of growth

the two-dimensional quantum-number lattice depicted in
Fig. 6(a). Also shown are contours of constant γ (or
λ), regarded as a continuous function of m and n, which
are seen more clearly in Fig. 6(b). Here we see a strik-
ing contrast with more generic systems [19], where the
constant-eigenvalue contours are segments of topological
circles enclosing the origin. In the ideal-MHD case the
contours are topologically hyperbolic, with asymptotes
radiating from the origin toward inﬁnity.

An interesting representation of the l = 0 spectrum
is shown in Fig. 7. A great deal of structure can be dis-
cerned, determined by the number-theoretic properties of
the interval of µ depicted. For instance, focusing on the
low-order rational number 4/7 we deﬁne spectral subsets

for all l) occurs at m =

For ﬁxed l and large mmax the number of eigenvalues
Nl(µ) in an interval of n/m between µl and µ is asymp-
totically equal to the area in the m, n plane [see Fig. 6(a)]
of the triangle bounded by the lines n = µm, n = µlm

Since contours of constant λ (or γ) asymptote to lines

we can estimate the number
of eigenvalues between two values of λ (or γ) by invert-
ing the function λµ,l for µ and substituting this into the
above expression for Nl(µ). The inverse is double-valued:

A ﬁner-scale plot is shown in Fig. 8(b), in which signif-
icant deviations from the Weyl curve are seen in the mi-
crostructure. The range shown in Fig. 8(b) is unusual in
that it contains two well-deﬁned accumulation sequences
in close proximity. These are associated with low-order
values of µ occurring on either side of the growth-rate
0.579—the sequence as-
maximum near µ = 11/19
sociated with µ = 5/9
0 and the one
associated with µ = 3/5 = 0.6 is in S+
0 . There are very
few eigenvalues associated with high-order rational values
of µ in the range shown and the two low-order sequences
present are practically unmixed, either with each other or
with eigenvalues associated with unrelated higher-order
rational values of µ. [In fact there is only one such high-
order mode in the region of the accumulation sequences,
µ = 51/92, the closest approximant to 5/9 in the set cor-
responding to S0(1/2
5/9), which causes the slight jump
|
seen in the µ = 3/5 sequence.] Also, the wide gap con-
taining no eigenvalues is because the intersection of the
gaps associated with the two low-order rationals is non-
empty.

In Fig. 9(a) we show the distribution of nearest-
neighbor unfolded eigenvalue spacings for SSuydam

in Fig. 9(b) that for the set S0 with the correct ﬁnite-
m eigenvalues. It is seen that the two distributions are
radically diﬀerent—even though low-order rational val-
ues of µ are rare and the distribution is coarse-grained,
the high-m approximation induces suﬃcient extra degen-
eracy that the Suydam spectrum is dominated by a large,
but spurious, delta-function-like spike at s = 0.
(The
range of µ used in Fig. 9 corresponds to the range of
l = 0 growth rates above the maximum l = 1 rate, in
which S0 is the only contributor to the spectrum.)

0

The reason why ﬁnite-m eﬀects are so important, de-
spite the smallness of the O(1/m2) corrections found in
Sec. III B 2, is seen from the Weyl formula, Eq. (28),
which shows that the average eigenvalue spacing in a
set containing all values of n/m within the range of in-
terest scales as m−2
max, which is the same order as the
smallest O(1/m2) correction within a set containing only
n/m = const. Thus in the set of accurate eigenvalues S0
there is a strong intermingling of eigenvalues with dif-
ferent n/m that does not occur in the approximate set
SSuydam

This explains why the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue
spacing distribution in Fig. 9(b) is much closer to the
Poisson distribution exp(
s) obtained for a random dis-
tribution of numbers on the real line, and also predicted
for generic separable systems [19], than that in Fig. 9(a).
Nevertheless the set of 625 eigenvalues used in Fig. 9(b)
is too small to say convincingly that the distribution is
or is not Poissonian, so we need to analyze larger data
sets to determine how close to generic the ideal-MHD
spectrum is.

Preparatory to the statistical analysis of eigenvalue
spacing it is standard practice to rescale, or unfold, the
eigenvalues so as to make their average separation unity,
thus making possible the comparison of diﬀerent systems

it is clear that the statistics are not exactly Poissonian.

In Fig. 10(b) we show the Dyson-Mehta rigidity param-
eter ∆3(L) [17, pp. 321–323], deﬁned as the least-squares
deviation of the unfolded eigenvalue staircase N (E) from
the best-ﬁtting straight line in an interval of length L.
Again, the behavior is similar to that for the completely
random spectrum (Poisson process) in that ∆3 increases
linearly with L, but the slope is slightly less than the
1/15 expected for the Poisson processs.

0 and S+

In order to understand the departure from Poisson
statistics better, we show in Fig. 11 the spacing dis-
tribution for the corresponding sets S−
0 . The
departure from Poisson statistics is now quite striking.
This is presumably because of the gaps about low-order
rational values of µ mentioned in Sec. IV, which leave
the 1-dimensional accumulation sequences S0(µ
µ) un-
|
mixed with other parts of the spectrum, so the spacing
distribution combines aspects of that for a 1-dimensional
system (peaked at 1) and that for a generic separable
2-dimensional system (peaked at 0).

In Fig. 12(a) we show the spacing distribution for the
l = 1 spectrum, which is seen to be very much like the l =
0 spectrum of Fig. 10(a) in its departure from the Poisson
distribution. However, we might expect that mixing the
l = 0 with the l = 1 spectrum will make the levels appear
more “random” and Fig. 12(b) conﬁrms that the level
spacing distribution does indeed become more like the
exponential expected for a Poisson process.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated that the statistical nature of the
ideal-MHD interchange spectrum deviates signiﬁcantly
from the random Poisson process of generic separable sys-
tems due to the number-theoretic structure of the eigen-
value distribution. The similarity between the two level-
spacing distributions in Fig. 11, which correspond to two
diﬀerent parts of the rotational transform proﬁle, sug-
gest the possibility that there may nevertheless be some
universality in the statistics. If so, we have found a new
universality class.

≤

The crude regularization used in this paper, simply
mmax, is
restricting the poloidal mode numbers to m
not very physical but corresponds closely to what is done
in the large three-dimensional eigenvalue codes CAS3D
[9] and TERPSICHORE [8]. Thus, apart from funda-
mental mathematical interest, the primary motivation
of this paper has been the numerical analysis of the
three-dimensional ideal-MHD spectrum as produced by
these codes. Preliminary results [23] on an interchange-
unstable stellarator test case show spectra with eigen-
value separation statistics similar to those of strongly
quantum chaotic systems. However, the results of the
present paper indicate that some caution should be taken
in interpreting ideal-MHD spectra in terms of conven-
tional quantum chaos theory because of the radically dif-
ferent nature of the dispersion relation.

In subsequent work it will be important to examine the
eﬀect of ﬁnite Larmor radius on the spectrum. However,
this typically makes the problem non-Hermitian and less
easy to compare with standard quantum chaos theory.

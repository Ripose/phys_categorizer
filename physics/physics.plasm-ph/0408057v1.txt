The National Ignition Facility (NIF) technology is designed to drive deuterium-tritium (DT)
internal conﬁnement fusion (ICF) targets to ignition using indirect radiation from laser beam energy
captured in a hohlraum. Hydrodynamical instabilities at interfaces in the ICF capsule leading to
mix between the DT fuel and the ablator shell material are of fundamental physical interest and can
aﬀect the performance characteristics of the capsule. In this Letter we describe new radiochemical
diagnostics for mix processes in ICF capsules with plastic or Be (0.9%Cu) ablator shells. Reactions of
high-energy tritons with shell material produce high-energy β-emitters. We show that mix between
the DT fuel and the shell material enhances high-energy prompt beta emission from these reactions
by more than an order of magnitude over that expected in the absence of mix.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The projected fusion yields at NIF suggest that radiochemical analysis of neutron and charged-particle incidental
reactions could provide important diagnostics for physical processes in the implosion and burn of an ICF capsule. In
particular, such reactions can probe mixing at the capsule interfaces owing to hydrodynamic instabilities. Materials
in current capsule designs can be used as eﬀective radiochemical detectors for mixing processes without introducing
additional dopants. For example, Stoyer et. al. pointed out that the 8O(α,n)21Ne reaction can be a sensitive probe
of plastic-shell mixing [1]. In the present paper we concentrate on capsule designs with either plastic or beryllium
shells. The capsules involve a layer of DT ice approximately 80 µm thick with ρ = 0.25 g cm−3, an interior gas ﬁll
ρ = 0.005 g cm−3, and an ablator layer thickness of approximately 155 µm. With a peak hohlraum temperature of
1.2 g cm−2 and achieve ignition with a yield up to about
330 eV, the capsules are expected to reach a peak
18 MJ.

A microscopic understanding of mix remains one of the key issues for ICF [3]. We propose to study mix of the
ablator shell into the DT fuel by measuring the number of interactions of tritons with the shell material. The promising
reactions emit high-energy βs, and we propose prompt β spectroscopy as a new probe of mix. We present the physics
underlying the sensitivity of these reaction rates to mix and estimates for the reaction yields under diﬀerent mix
scenarios.

II. DETECTION

The set of core NIF diagnostics is expected to include a Debris Collector and Rad-Chem Station [4]. A suite of
collectors will be placed on the target chamber wall, covering multiple lines of sight. Variations of this capability
could allow for prompt diagnostics. An alternate scheme that would allow a higher collection fraction is a variation
of the gas collection system designed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [1] and installed at OMEGA. The
reactions of interest in this letter would require the gas collection system to be fast enough to isolate samples with
half-lives on the order of seconds.

The triton induced reactions of most interest for our proposed studies of mix produce high-energy β emitters. For
the plastic ablator shells we consider the 18O(t, n)20F(β−), and 13C(t, α)12B(β−) reactions, and for the Be ablator
shells the 9Be(t, α)8Li(β−) and 9Be(t, p)11Be(β−) reactions.

The energy of the βs is high enough for them to be clearly distinguishable from prompt laser ejected electrons.
In the cases of 20F and 11Be, the additional
Table III summarizes the properties of all the reactions of interest.
coincidence γ-ray aids detection and distinction from βs of similar energy. The cross sections are not known for all
the reactions. The 9Be(t,α)8Li(β−) reaction has a cross section of about 17 mb at 0.5-MeV and about 185 mb at 1.5
MeV [5]. The 9Be(t,p)11Be(β−) reaction has a threshold at 1.55 MeV and a cross section of about 1 mb at 3 MeV.
The 18O(t,n)20F cross section is not known but is expected to be reasonably large [6].

A thick aluminum window on the beta spectrometer in the Debris Collector would act as a high-energy gate to
eliminate the background, and the diﬀerent life-times of the β decays of interest would be used to distinguish the

reactions. The number of decays needed to provide a half-life signature and counting statistics better than 10% is
about 104 atoms. The solid angle for debris collection is about 10−6, assuming a 1 cm2 debris collector. The beta
counter eﬃciency on the order of 10% includes the eﬀect of the aluminum absorber. The minimum number of atoms
needed to provide the requisite number of decays is thus 1010 atoms for a debris collection system. This limit could
be lowered a few orders of magnitude by increasing the eﬀective area for debris collection.

The 20F gaseous products could be retrieved by a gas collection system. The eﬃciency for ﬂuorine collection should
be high because the NIF target chamber is constructed of aluminum. The estimated time for 99% collection of gases
is 90 seconds. The reduction in the number of atoms during collection is 3.5 x 10−4 for 20F. The eﬃciency for an
internal (4π) gas proportional counter is near 100%. Therefore, the minimum number of atoms for a detection is
about 108 for 20F.

III. MIX REACTION RATE ENHANCEMENT

A. Knock-on Triton Fluence

The energetic tritons in the above reactions are produced by collisions with high energy neutrons from the central
DT burn. We call these knock-on tritons. The number of knock-on tritons scales with the high-energy neutron
production. Some of these energetic tritons go on to fuse with deuterium, some will escape, but a signiﬁcant fraction
will react with detector nuclei in the shell. Stopping of these energetic tritons reduces the probability of reaction with
nuclei in the shell. If the shell material is intimately mixed with the fuel, the reaction yields are enhanced by the ratio
of the mixing length (the thickness of the mixed region) to the triton stopping length in the unmixed fuel. Therefore,
the total number of reactions of knock-on tritons with shell material is a measure of the mixing.

In the typical implosion scenario, ignition occurs near the center of the DT volume, in the hotspot region. The DT
combustion progresses outward from the hotspot, ﬁnally reaching the shell region and completing. During most of
the burn, the interfacial region near the shell is inert, evolving hydrodynamically under the external driving force and
the internal pressure. During the interior burn, the interfacial region is bathed in 14 MeV neutrons which produce
a spectrum of energetic knock-on tritons. Because the triton stopping length in the DT plasma is relatively short,
only knock-on tritons produced near the interfacial region contribute to the high-energy part of the triton spectrum
as seen by the shell material. A radially localized source of high-energy tritons is created near the shell, absent of
complications due to the DT-burn wave, which is still near the center of the capsule.

For the nominal design discussed in this paper, approximately 1019 high-energy (14 MeV) neutrons are produced
by DT burn. The shape of the neutron spectrum does not deviate signiﬁcantly from a thermally-broadened 14-MeV
peak because the system is quite thin to high-energy neutrons. The diﬀerential production rate for knock-on tritons
at a point in the fuel is φnnt(dσnt/dE), where φn is the neutron ﬂux, nt is the triton density at the speciﬁed point,
and dσnt/dE is the (normalized) distribution of tritons in the ﬁnal state due to collisions with 14-MeV neutrons, a
known kinematic function. The eﬀective size (radius) of the triton source and the distortion of the triton spectrum
depend on the Coulomb drag. Using an analytic approximation for path length [7], integrating over the position of
triton production, and assuming that the triton density and the electron temperature in the fuel are approximately
constant over a triton trajectory, we obtain the diﬀerential knock-on triton ﬂuence

B. Scenario I: No-Mix, Smooth and Wrinkled Shells

First we consider the interaction of energetic tritons with a thick unmixed region of shell material. The tritons
cross the surface of the material with a diﬀerential ﬂuence given by Eq.(1). The rate of triton reactions with the shell
nuclei is small compared to the rate of energy loss, so that the probability of reaction of a triton of energy E with a
shell nucleus is

electron density and temperature, ˆne and ˆθe, are constant over the the distance of a triton stopping length, we then

The total number of reactions of high-energy tritons with shell nuclei is obtained by integrating the product of Eq.(1)
and Eq.(2), and multiplying by the shell area. We also need to introduce a geometric ﬂux factor g(E) which is depen-
dent on the triton energy, since higher energy tritons are produced preferentially in the forward (radial) direction. For
a surface described by periodic wrinkling with maximum normal deﬂection angle χ, the geometric ﬂux factor is given by

The sensitivity of the t + shell reaction rate to the threshold energy and the shape of the fuel/shell interface

Scenario II: Chunk Mix

Next we consider the case of so-called chunk mix, where micron-scale pieces of shell material are injected into the
fuel region by shell instabilities. This case is relatively easy to treat as a modiﬁcation of the unmixed case treated
above. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the chunks are large enough to stop energetic tritons within their volume and that
the spacing between chunks is larger than the triton stopping length in the fuel. In this situation there is no shielding

As the shape of the interface (2χ/π) goes from ﬂat (2χ/π=0) to highly wrinkled (2χ/π =0.9) there is less than a factor of two
increase in the reaction rate.

eﬀect for triton production and the total number of reactions is enhanced by a simple geometric factor (

where ℓ is a mixing length, giving the size of the region over which chunks are dispersed, Rc is the average size of
chunks, and ρc/ρshell gives the fraction of shell material mixed into the fuel as chunks, as a fraction of the nominal
shell material density. This ﬁnal factor can be quite small in physically reasonable situations, although it is partially
compensated by the ratio ℓ/Rc, which can be expected to be large.

Hydrodynamic simulations typically show interface instabilities leading to the formation of highly non-linear inter-
face structures, not unlike our highly-wrinkled no-mix scenario. Assuming that these structures can break-oﬀ and
4µmm,
lead to chunk mix, the chunk radii would be of the order of a micron. With an assumed mixing length ℓ
this scenario would imply ℓ/Rc
1. Thus, no enhancement over the highly-wrinkled-but-unmixed interface would be
expected for large chunk-mix. On the other hand, if the chunks mixed into the gas were small (order of 0.1 µm) the
enhancement factor

chunk could be as large as a factor of about two.

D. Scenario III: Atomic Mix

Finally we consider the situation in which an atomically mixed region exists near the shell interface, characterized
by a mixing length ℓ. In this case the high-energy tritons interact directly with shell ions mixed into the fuel. The

In a realistic physical picture, the density of the DT gas and the shell ions are more likely to vary (as opposed to
remaining constant) across the mix region. For a linear mixing proﬁle, this variation reduces the t + shell reaction
rate by a factor of 1/6, which is included in above estimate.

Imix(w∗) is easily evaluated and some results are given in Table II. The values for this integral are an order of
magnitude larger than the values obtained for I(w∗, χ). This enhancement reﬂects the immersion of the shell material
in the fuel, which gives a volume enhancement proportional to the ratio of the mixing length to the triton stopping
length.

Coulomb barrier. To estimate the yields for the chuck mix scenario we took 2χ/π = 0.5 and Echunk = 2.0.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Charged particle reactions leading to prompt high-energy β-decay signals can provide an important diagnostic for
mixing in ICF capsules. The predicted number of such reactions, at the yields and neutron ﬂuences expected at the
NIF facility, is suﬃcient for a detectable radiochemical signature of mixing processes. Our estimates for the interaction
of high-energy knock-on tritons with shell material suggest that an adequate number of beta-emitters are produced
to provide a unique prompt diagnostic for mix between the fuel region and the shell material. The reaction yields for
the t + shell reactions of interest are enhanced by the ratio of the mixing length to the triton stopping length, and
this leads to increased reaction yields of more than an order of magnitude over the no-mix situation. Table III lists
and summarizes our estimated t +9 Be, t +18 O, and t +13 C reaction yields for the diﬀerent mix scenarios.

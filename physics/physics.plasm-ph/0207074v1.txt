Abstract

Possibility of establishment of equilibrium between the photon and the

dense photon bunch is studied. In the case, when the density of plasma does

not change, the condition of production of the Bose-Einstein condensate is

obtained. It is shown that the inhomogeneity of density of photons leads to

a new intermediate state of the photon gas.

Importance of scattering processes in interaction of photons with an electron gas was

noted for the ﬁrst time by Kompaneets [1]. Who has shown that the establishment of equi-

librium between the photons and the electrons is possible through the Compton eﬀect. The

role of the Compton eﬀect in setting equilibrium between the photons and the electrons was

discussed by Kompaneets in the nonrelativistic approximation. In his consideration, since

the free electron does not absorb and emit, but only scatters the photon, the total number of

photons is conserved. Taking into account the fact that for the high frequencies of photons

the probability of Compton scattering exceeds the absorption probability, Kompaneets has

derived the kinetic equation for the photon distribution function. Using the kinetic equa-

tion of Kompaneets, Zel’dovich and Levich [2] have shown that in the absence of absorption

the photons undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. Such a possibility for the Bose-Einstein

condensation occurs in the case, when the processes of change of energy and momentum in

scattering dominates over the processes involving change of photon number in their emis-

sion and absorption. Thus, in the above papers [1], [2] the authors demonstrated that the

usual Compton scattering leads to the establishment of equilibrium state and Bose-Einstein

condensation in the photon-plasma medium.

In the present letter, we show that exists an another new mechanism of creation of

equilibrium state and Bose-Einstein condensation in a nonideal dense photon gas. In our

consideration we assume that the intensity of radiation (strong and super-strong laser pulse,

non-equilibrium cosmic ﬁeld radiation, etc.) is suﬃciently large, so that the photon-photon

interaction can become more likely than the photon-electron interaction. Under these con-

ditions in the case of relativistic intensities of radiation of electromagnetic (EM) waves, we

may consider the system of two weakly interacting subsystems: the photon gas and the

plasma, which slowly exchange energy between each other. In other words, relaxation in the

photon-plasma system is then a two-stage process: ﬁrstly the local equilibrium is established

in each subsystem independently, corresponding to some average energies Eγ = KBTγ and

Ep = KBTp, where KB is the Boltzmann constant, Tγ is the characteristic ”temperature” of

the photon gas, and Tp is the plasma temperature.

As it was mentioned above, in the case of the strong radiation of EM waves there is an

appreciable probability that the photon-photon interaction takes place, the phases of the

waves will, in general, be random functions of time. We need therefore not be interested

in the phases and can average over them. Under these conditions the perturbation state of

the photon gas can be described in terms of the occupation number N(~k, ω, ~r, t) of photons

and study how these numbers change due to the processes of interaction of the photons with

others or with plasma electrons. Here, N(~k, ω, ~r, t) is the slowly varying function in space

and time.

A new version of kinetic equation for the occupation number N(~k, ω, ~r, t) of photons,

for modes propagating with wavevector ~k and frequency ω, at a position ~r and time t, was

derived in Refs. [3], [4], [5]

We speciﬁcally note here that in Eqs. (1) and (4) there are two forces of distinctive nature,

which can change the occupation number of photons. One force appears due to the redistri-

bution of electrons in space,

ne, and time, ∂ne

∂t . The other force arises by the variation of

shape of wavepacket. In other words, this force originates from the alteration of the average

kinetic energy of the electron oscillating in the rapidly varying ﬁeld of the EM waves (

γ,

∂γ
∂t ).

In the following we shall consider the case, when the slowly varying function N(~k, ω, ~r, t)

essentially changes on the distance L and in time t, which satisfy the inequalities ωpt

and L

. Under these conditions, the density of plasma almost does not change in

comparison with the energy of EM ﬁeld, i.e., we take into account the forces only due to the

variation of γ. In this approximation, the statistical equilibrium between photons and the

photon bunch will establish itself as a result of the ”Compton” scattering processes.

For convenience we introduce momentum and the ”rest” energy of the photon as ~p = ¯h~k

γ1/2 , respectively. With these notations in the quasi-stationary case Eq.(4)

The photon gas is characterized by an arbitrary initial distribution with some average

energy. This may, in particular, be a Bose-Einstein distribution with a characteristic temper-

ature Tγ, which, in general, will diﬀer from the plasma temperature. Slower processes of the

equalization of the photon and the plasma particle temperatures will take place afterwards.

The form of expression (7) coincides with the expression for the relativistic energy of material

particles, so that the rest mass mγ is associated with the photon in a plasma. We note that

in contrast to material particles, the rest mass of photons depends on the plasma density and

the relativistic gamma factor through the electron mass. Hence, the rest mass of photons is

the function of the spatial coordinate ~r.

It should be noted that the production of the Bose-Einstein condensates is realized, as follows

from Eqs. (9) and (10), in regions, where the ﬁeld intensity is large.

Now we will show that the inhomogeneity of intensity of the EM ﬁeld leads to the

intermediate state of the Bose-Einstein condensates of the photon gas. The point is that the

relativistic gamma factor, γ, is the function of spatial coordinates and at diﬀerent points γ

is diﬀerent, which means that the eﬀective mass mγ of the photon, as a function of γ, also

changes in the usual space. Hence, one can ﬁnd some points or regions of high intensities

in the gas volume, where equality (10) is fulﬁlled, so that the photon gas is found in the

6

Bose-Einstein condensate state, whereas in the rest of the domains or points the photons

remain in normal state, for which inequality (9) is satisﬁed. We can therefore conclude that

in such a case the photon gas, as whole is in the intermediate state. This eﬀect resembles

the Landau’s intermediate state in superconductor.

In order to make this statement more clear, we consider periodically modulated cylindri-

cally shaped laser pulse (light bullet). We assume that the ﬁeld intensity is uniform in the

transverse direction (in general, it is not necessary) of propagation of pulses and periodic

along the light bullet (1D optical lattices). In this case the relativistic gamma factor has

the following form

γ =

1 + Q0(1 + dcosqz) ,

q

(17)

where Q0 is a constant, d and 2π

q are the depth and the period of modulation, respectively.

Furthermore, we assume the periodic boundary conditions N(~p, z) = N(~p, z + L), and

γ(z) = γ(z + L), with L being the length of the light bullet.

We then suppose that at all points z = 2π

q l (where l = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) photons are in the

Bose-Einstein condensate state, that is µγ = ¯hωp/

1 + Q0(1 + d). Obviously, at other points

q

the condition (10) is not valid, so that the photons stay ordinary.

Thus, the light bullet is divided into numerous parallel alternating thin layers of the

normal and the Bose-Einstein condensate photon gas. This state of the photon gas may be

called the intermediate state.

We should emphasize that this phenomenon can also exist in the case of the usual Comp-

ton processes, when the photon-electron interaction is more important than the photon-

photon one. In this case, in the expression (5) we should take into account the variation of

density of the electrons.

In conclusion, we have presented a new concept of establishment of the equilibrium

between the photon and the wavepacket of the EM ﬁeld (the dense photon bunch). This is

the fully relativistic eﬀect due to the strong EM radiation. We have studied the possibility

of creation of the Bose-Einstein condensates for the case, when the density of plasma does

not change. We have shown that the inhomogeneous dense photon gas can be found in

the intermediate state. We think that this state is most common in interaction of the

relativistically intense EM waves with plasmas. We believe that the intermediate state can

be experimentally observed in atomic gases of alkaline elements contained in magnetic traps

[6].

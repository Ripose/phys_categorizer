Transition phenomena between thermodynamic branch and turbulent branch in sub-
marginal turbulent plasma are analyzed with statistical theory. Time-development of
turbulent ﬂuctuation is obtained by numerical simulations of Langevin equation which
contains submarginal characteristics. Probability density functions and transition rates
between two states are analyzed. Transition from turbulent branch to thermodynamic
branch occurs in almost entire region between subcritical bifurcation point and linear
stability boundary.

sition rate, probability density function

§1.

Introduction

There have been observed various kinds of formations and destructions of transport barriers.

Both in edge and internal regions of high temperature plasmas, the dynamical change often occurs

on the short time scale, sometimes triggered by subcritical bifurcation. These features naturally
lead to the concept of transition.1)

The transition takes place as a statistical process in the presence of statistical noise source

which is induced by strong turbulence ﬂuctuation. As a generic feature, the transition occurs with

a ﬁnite probability when a controlling parameter approaches the critical value.

The nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, which deals with dynamical phase transitions and
critical phenomena, should be extended for inhomogeneous plasma turbulence.2) To this end,

statistical theory for plasma turbulence has been developed and stochastic equations of motion
(the Langevin equations) of turbulent plasma were derived.3) The framework to calculate the

probability density function (PDF), the transition rates etc. have also been made.

In this paper, we apply the theoretical algorithm to an inhomogeneous plasma with the pressure

gradient and the shear of the magnetic ﬁeld. Microturbulence in the system is known to be sub-
critically excited from the thermodynamic branch.4) The transition between the thermodynamic

branch and the turbulent branch is studied. We show that the transition occurs stochastically by

numerically solving the Langevin equation of the turbulent plasmas. In order to characterize the

stochastic nature of the transition, the frequency of occurrence of a transition per unit time (the

transition rate) is calculated as a function of the pressure-gradient and the plasma temperature.

The results show that the transition from the turbulent branch to the thermodynamic branch occurs

in a wide region instead of at a transition point.

§2. Theoretical Framework

In this section, we brieﬂy review the theoretical framework3) used in our analysis of turbulent

plasmas.

The theory is based on the Langevin equation, eq. (1), derived by renormalizing with the

direct-interaction approximation the reduced MHD for the three ﬁelds: the electro-static potential,

the current and the pressure. The Langevin equation gives the time-development of the ﬂuctuating

parts of the three ﬁelds as

∂f
∂t

+ ˆLf = N (t), where f (t) ≡

φ(t)

J(t)

p(t)







.







(1)

In this equation, the nonlinear terms are divided into two parts: One part is coherent with the test
ﬁeld f (t) and is included into the renormalized operator ˆL. The other is incoherent and is modeled

by a random noise N (t). Since N (t) is a force which ﬂuctuates randomly in time, the Langevin

equation describes the stochastic time-development of the ﬂuctuation of the three ﬁelds.

By analyzing the Langevin equation eq. (1), a number of statistical properties of turbulent

plasmas can be derived. For example, the analytical formulae for the change rate of plasma states,

the transition rates, were derived. Furthermore, since the renormalized transport coeﬃcients come

from the term of the random force N (t), relations between the ﬂuctuation levels of turbulence and

the transport coeﬃcients like the viscosity and the thermal diﬀusivity were derived.

§3. A Model

With the theoretical framework brieﬂy described in the previous section, we analyze a model
of inhomogeneous plasmas with the pressure-gradient and the shear of the magnetic ﬁeld.3) The

model is formulated with the reduced MHD for the three ﬁelds of the electro-static potential, the

current and the pressure. The shear of the magnetic ﬁeld is given as B = (0, B0sx, B0) where
B0(x) = const × (1 + Ω′x + · · · ). The pressure is assumed to change in x−direction.

It has been known that in this system bifurcation due to the subcritical excitation of the current

diﬀusive interchange mode (CDIM) occurs4) as shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1 shows the dependence of the turbulent ion-viscosity on the pressure-gradient. The

turbulent ion-viscosity is proportional to the ﬂuctuation level. Both the pressure-gradient and the

turbulent viscosity are normalized. It is clearly seen that the bifurcation between a low viscosity

state and a high viscosity state occurs. Due to the bifurcation, transition between the two states

furcation between a low viscosity state (the thermodynamic branch) and a high viscosity state (the turbulent
branch) occurs. The arrows indicate the typical values of the pressure-gradient where some physical quantities

and hysteresis are expected to be observed. The low viscosity state is called “the thermodynamic

branch”, since this state is continually linked to thermal equilibrium. We call the high viscosity
state “the turbulent branch”, since the ﬂuctuation level is also large in a strong turbulent limit.3)

The ridge point where the turbulent branch ends is denoted “the subcritical bifurcation point”. The

region between the subcritical bifurcation point and the ridge near the linear stability boundary is

called “the bi-stable regime”.

From the deterministic point of view, the transition from the thermodynamic branch to the

turbulent branch is expected to occur only at the ridge point near the linear stability boundary

and the transition in the opposite direction is expected to occur only at the subcritical bifurcation

point.

§4. Stochastic Occurrence of the Transition

In order to capture the characteristics of the two states, we concentrate on the time-development

of the energy of ﬂuctuation of the electric ﬁeld, ε(t). The quantity ε(t) obeys the coarse-grained

Langevin equation, eq. (2), which has been derived in ref. 3.

d
dt

ε(t) = −2λ(ε)ε(t) + η(ε)R(t).

(2)

Here, R(t) is assumed to be the Gaussian noise whose variance is unity. The coeﬃcients λ(ε) and

η(ε) depend on the pressure-gradient and the temperature and so the shapes of the functions for

one regime of the pressure-gradient are completely diﬀerent from that for the other regime. The

shapes of λ(ε) and η(ε) for each of three regimes are shown in Fig. 2. For the detailed formulae of

λ(ε) and η(ε), see ref. 5.

The essential point is that the function λ(ε) takes both a positive and a negative value in the

bi-stable regime (Fig. 2 (b)). So, the ﬂuctuation of the electric ﬁeld is suppressed when λ(ε) is

positive and it is excited when λ(ε) is negative. Consequently, there are two metastable states in

the bi-stable regime.

By solving numerically eq. (2), we obtain the following samples of a time-series for each of

three values of the pressure-gradient (three points (a), (b) and (c) shown in Fig. 1). When the

pressure-gradient is ﬁxed at the value smaller than the subcritical bifurcation value ((a) in Fig. 1),

there is only small ﬂuctuation since the system is always in the thermodynamic branch as shown

in Fig. 3 (a).

On the other hand, when the pressure-gradient takes a value in the bi-stable regime ((b) in

Fig. 1), bursts are observed intermittently as shown in Fig. 3 (b). That is, transition between the

thermodynamic branch and the turbulent branch occurs stochastically. The bursts correspond to

the turbulent branch and the laminar corresponds to the thermodynamic branch. The fact that the

residence times at the each states are random leads to the statistical description of the transition

with the transition rates described in the rest of this paper.

When the value of the pressure-gradient is larger than that of the linear stability boundary

((c) in Fig. 1), bursts are always observed (see Fig. 3 (c)). It means that the system is always in

the turbulent branch.

§5. The Probability Density Functions

In order to characterize the random ﬂuctuation shown in the last section, we introduce the

probability density function (PDF) P (ε) deﬁned as the probability density that a random variable

takes a certain value ε. PDFs often reveal the invisible structures hidden in randomly ﬂuctuating

data ε(t).

By counting the frequency of realization of a certain value ε from time-serieses of ε(t) over

suﬃciently long time, the histogram is obtained. The PDF P (ε) is the histogram normalized with

the total frequency. So, in general, the PDF can be obtained from time-serieses observed in real

experiments as a normalized histogram.

Figure 4 shows the PDFs for three regimes of the pressure-gradient obtained from the time-

series shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3 (b) shows that transition frequently occurs between the turbulent

branch and the thermodynamic branch. Dithering between these two states is observed also in the

PDF as the two peaks in Fig. 4 (b).

Figure 5 (a) shows the tail of the PDF when the pressure-gradient is ﬁxed at the value smaller

than the subcritical bifurcation value. The PDF obeys the power-law for relatively large ε, even

though the system is in the thermodynamic branch. The power-law tail when the value of the

pressure-gradient is larger than that of the linear stability boundary is shown in Fig. 5 (b).

It is important from the point of view of theoretical investigation to note that the PDFs are also

obtained as solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation equivalent to the Langevin equation eq. (2).

§6. The Transition Rates

In order to formulate the stochastic transition phenomena in the bi-stable regime, we introduce

the transition rates. There are transitions in two opposite direction:

the transition from the

thermodynamic branch to the turbulent branch, which we call “the forward transition, and the

transition in the opposite direction is called “the backward transition”. There are two transition

rates. One is the forward transition rate rf which is the frequency of occurrence of the forward

transition per unit time and the other is the backward transition rate rb deﬁned similarly as the

frequency of occurrence of the backward transition per unit time.

It is important to note that these quantities are observable quantities.

It is easily shown

that the forward transition rate is equal to the average of inverse of the residence time at the

thermodynamic branch and the backward transition rate is equal to the average of inverse of the

residence time at the turbulent branch. Therefore, these transition rates can be measured from the

time-serieses of ﬂuctuation.

We determine the value of the pressure-gradient with which the transition occurs frequently.

The transition rates are calculated with the formulae derived in ref. 6. Figure 6 shows the depen-

dence of the forward transition rate and the backward transition rate on the pressure gradient in

the bi-stable regime, i.e., (b) in Fig. 1.

bi-stable regime. The left edge and the right edge of the horizontal axis corresponds to the subcritical bifurcation
point and the linear stability boundary. It is seen that the forward transition occurs mainly in the vicinity of
the linear stability boundary. (b) The dependence of the backward transition rate per unit time on the pressure
gradient in the bi-stable regime. It is seen that the backward transition occurs in the almost entire bi-stable
regime.

The forward transition triggered by the thermal noise occurs mainly in the vicinity of the

linear stability boundary. In contrast, it is clearly seen that the backward transition occurs in the

almost entire bi-stable regime in contrast to the expectation from the deterministic point of view of

bifurcation phenomena. This behavior is due to strong turbulent ﬂuctuation. It is noted that the

backward transition, i.e. the transition in a turbulence, occurs in a “region” instead of a “point”

of the parameter space.

§7. Hysteresis Phenomena

Up to now, the value of the pressure-gradient is ﬁxed. Next, in order to investigate hysteresis

phenomena, we turn to the case when the pressure-gradient changes in time.

It is important to investigate this case, since the pressure-gradient can be a dynamical variable

in realistic plasmas. Since the characteristic time-scale of the transition is given by the inverse of the

transition rate, 1/r, the eﬀect of the change of the pressure-gradient is governed by the interrelation

between the transition rate r and the time-rate of the change of the pressure-gradient, ˙g(t). When

| ˙g(t)/g(t)| ∼ r or | ˙g(t)/g(t)| > r, the system cannot follow the change of the pressure-gradient g(t).

Then, the state of the system depends on the value of the pressure-gradient g(t) in the past and

hysteresis phenomena are expected to be observed.

On the other hand, when | ˙g(t)/g(t)| ≪ r, the system can follow the change of the pressure-

gradient g(t). Since in this case the state of the system is the steady state for the value of the

pressure-gradient at the moment, hysteresis phenomena cannot be observed.

The protocol to change the pressure-gradient is as follows (see Fig. 7.): At ﬁrst the pressure-

gradient is increased through the bi-stable regime and after that it is decreased to the original

value. The time-rate of change of the pressure-gradient is assumed to be constant for simplicity.

Furthermore, in order to observe hysteresis, the speed of change of the pressure-gradient is chosen

so that it is of the same order of the transition rates or larger than that.

Fig. 7. The protocol to change the pressure-gradient to analyze hysteresis phenomena. At ﬁrst the pressure-gradient
is increased through the bi-stable regime (1.45 < g < 1.65)and after that it is decreased to the original value
(g = 1). The time-rate of change of the pressure-gradient is assumed to be constant | ˙g(t)| = 0.1 for simplicity.

Figure 8 (a) and (b) are the samples of hysteresis loops drawn by numerically solving the

Langevin equation eq. (2). The dashed lines show ε when the pressure-gradient is increased and

the solid lines show ε when the pressure-gradient is decreased. These ﬁgures, Fig. 8 (a) and (b), are

obtained for the exactly same temperature and the time-rate of change of the pressure-gradient. The

forward transition occurs around at g = 1.65 in both cases shown in Fig. 8 (a) and (b). However,

Stochastic transition between turbulent branch and thermodynamic branch of an inhomogeneous plasma

9

the backward transition point shown in Fig. 8 (a) around at g = 1.5 is completely diﬀerent from the

transition point around g = 1.6 shown in Fig. 8 (b). It is because the backward transition can occur

in the almost entire bi-stable regime as shown in the analysis of the backward transition rate (see

Fig. 6 (b)). Consequently, the backward transition point changes stochastically from case to case.

Since the distribution of the transition point is due to strong turbulent ﬂuctuation, it is expected in

general that transition points between diﬀerent turbulent branches are distributed stochastically.
We expect that distribution of the L/H transition point observed in real experiments7) is explained

in this direction.

§8. Summary and Discussion

Summarizing our work, we applied the statistical theory of plasma turbulence to problems of the

transition phenomena of submarginal turbulence. By numerically solving the Langevin equation,

the typical time-development of ﬂuctuation is obtained. It tells that the transition for the model

of inhomogeneous plasma occurs stochastically and suggests how the transition phenomena due to

subcritical bifurcation may look in time-serieses obtained in real experiments.

Furthermore, we obtained the PDFs of ε(t) and the pressure-gradient dependence of the tran-

sition rates. It is shown that the backward transition occurs with almost equal frequency in the

entire bi-stable regime, so the transition occurs in a “region”. The concept “transition region”

is necessary in the analysis of data obtained by real experiments. It is conﬁrmed that the back-

ward transition does not occur only at the bifurcation point but occur also in the region of the

pressure-gradient by observing the hysteresis loops obtained by numerically solving the Langevin

equation.

It is important to discuss whether the transition phenomena considered in this paper can be

10

observed in real experiments. Since the characteristic time-scale of the transition is given by the

inverse of the transition rate, observability depends on the interrelation between the time resolution

of observation △t and the transition rate r. When △t is much smaller than 1/r, the transition

phenomena as shown in Fig. 3 (a) are expected to be observed. On the other hand, when △t

is of the same order of 1/r or larger than 1/r, transition phenomena average out and only the

average over △t is observed. This discussion is generic regardless of the type of transition, e.g. the

transition between the thermodynamic branch and the turbulent branch, L/H transition etc.

Abstract

A system of nonlocal electron-transport equations for small perturbations in a magnetized plasma

is derived using the systematic closure procedure of V. Yu. Bychenkov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.

75, 4405 (1995). Solution to the linearized kinetic equation with a Landau collision operator is

obtained in the diﬀusive approximation. The Fourier components of the longitudinal, oblique, and

transversal electron ﬂuxes are found in an explicit form for quasistatic conditions in terms of the

generalized forces: the gradients of density and temperature, and the electric ﬁeld. The full set of

nonlocal transport coeﬃcients is given and discussed. Nonlocality of transport enhances electron

ﬂuxes across magnetic ﬁeld above the values given by strongly collisional local theory. Dispersion

and damping of magnetohydrodynamic waves in weakly collisional plasmas is discussed. Nonlocal

transport theory is applied to the problem of temperature relaxation across the magnetic ﬁeld in

a laser hot spot.

INTRODUCTION

Nonlocal transport theories remain the subject of active studies in plasma physics espe-

cially in laser produced plasmas. The strong dependence of the collisional mean-free-path

on the particle kinetic energy limits the validity of standard local transport relations to very

long inhomogeneity scale lengths L. The value of L has to be at least a hundred times

longer than the electron-ion mean-free-path, λei, for the Chapman-Enskog perturbative ap-

proach [1] to be valid [2]. This condition can be easily violated in most of the hot plasmas

produced by high energy lasers. Likewise, many magnetized plasmas in laboratory [3] and

astrophysics require kinetic modeling because of the large values of λei/L. In the presence

of a strong magnetic ﬁeld electron transport can be localized in the transverse direction by

the short gyroradius, ρ. Therefore, often only nonlocal transport in response to longitudinal

gradients is considered (cf. e.g.

[4]). We will show that for an arbitrary direction of the

gradient, longitudinal transport coeﬃcients are aﬀected by the magnetic ﬁeld in the nonlocal

transport regime.

Nonlocality of thermal transport has been well documented in experiments. For example,

no agreement was found between theory and experiment for time-resolved two-dimensional

images of x-ray emissions [5, 6] until nonlocal electron transport was included. It is also clear

that self-generated magnetic ﬁelds play an important role in the evolution of laser fusion

plasmas [7]. These observations have motivated our current study, which also complements

previous works on magnetized plasmas [4, 8, 9] in the regime of weak collisionality.

We have applied the method of Ref. [10] to derive nonlocal closure relations for a plasma

with a magnetic ﬁeld. The result is equivalent to the linearized kinetic theory of small

amplitude perturbations. Our derivation involves a solution to the initial value problem

for the electron kinetic equation with electron-electron (e-e) and electron-ion (e-i) Landau

collision operators. The linearized kinetic equation is solved in the Fourier k-vector space

for slowly varying processes. We use approximations which make our results correct for

high-Z plasmas. We have neglected e-e collisions in the equation for the anisotropic part of

the electron distribution function. Electron-electron collisions are only kept in the equation

for the isotropic part of the distribution function which is unaﬀected by e-i collisions. In

addition, the anisotropic part of the electron distribution function (EDF) is approximated

by a single angular harmonic. This corresponds to the so called linearized diﬀusive Fokker-

2

Planck model [11, 12, 13]. The original study [10] of an unmagnetized plasma employed

a summation technique [15, 16], which included an inﬁnite set of angular harmonics and

thus ensured validity of the transport theory over the entire range of particle collisionality

including collisionless limit. Here, because of the geometrical complexity introduced by the

magnetic ﬁeld we are unable to carry the summation over the inﬁnite set of harmonics.

Therefore our results are applicable to an inhomogeneity scale length corresponding to k-

vectors such that k⊥ρ < 1 and kkλei < 1, where k⊥ and kk are wave vector components with

respect to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. However, in the case where the spatial gradients

are almost orthogonal to the direction of magnetic ﬁeld our theory is valid even for kλei > 1

provided kλei < λei/ρ. The validity condition kkλei < 1 is more relevant to dense plasmas

as for example in inertial conﬁnement fusion targets. Finally the closure relations derived

in this paper apply to small amplitude perturbations of temperature, density and electric

ﬁeld about the homogeneous equilibrium state. A rigorous generalization of these results

to nonlocal and nonlinear transport theory is a diﬃcult problem. One possible solution,

[14] is based on linear theory results for varying in space background parameters. One can

also gain a valuable insight into validity of diﬀerent phenomenological models reproducing

Fokker-Planck simulation results as in Ref. [6].

An important diﬀerence between the nonlocal theory of unmagnetized plasmas [10] and

that for magnetized plasmas is that one now deals with three diﬀerent components of the

electron ﬂux:

longitudinal, transverse, and oblique. All of these are calculated here in

the Fourier-space and are related by closure relations to perturbations in the temperature,

density and electric ﬁeld. Hydrodynamical variables have been deﬁned in such a way that in

strongly collisional limit we recover classical local results of the Chapman-Enskog method

[1] .

The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a linearized solution to the kinetic

FP equation for the EDF in a magnetized plasma.

In Sec.

III we use this solution to

derive the nonlocal electron ﬂux. The strongly collisional limit is examined in Sec.

IV.

Section V is devoted to study of nonlocal transport coeﬃcients and their dependence on

the collisionality parameter and the Hall parameter. Nonlocal hydrodynamic equations for

small perturbations are formulated in Sec. VI and are used to derive dispersion relations

and damping of MHD waves. In Sec. VII we apply our transport theory to study of the hot

spot temperature relaxation in the context of laser produced plasma with a self-generated

3

magnetic ﬁeld. We conclude with a discussion and summary in Sec. VIII.

II. ELECTRON DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION IN A MAGNETIZED PLASMA

where E is the electric ﬁeld, c is the speed of light, e and me are the electron charge and

electron mass, Cei[fe] and Cee[fe, fe] are electron-ion and electron-electron collision terms

[17].

Following the previous study [10], we develop a new nonlocal transport theory of a

magnetized plasma which describes the plasma response to small–amplitude perturbations.

The EDF, fe, is written as the sum of Maxwellian function, F0, (with homogeneous back-

ground electron density ne and temperature Te) and an isotropic perturbation, δf0, and an

anisotropic perturbation, δfan: fe = F0 + δf0(v) + δfan(v). Small amplitude linear pertur-

bations are described in terms of Fourier components characterized by the wave vector k.

The linearized kinetic equation (1) gives two coupled equations for the perturbed EDFs, δf0

and δfan, in k-space

corresponds to the so-called diﬀusive limit of the Fokker-Planck equation [cf. e.g. ([13])].

This amounts to keeping only leading terms in the angular expansion of δfan as discussed

in Ref. ([9]). Such approximation may always be justiﬁed by invoking a suﬃciently large Z

and magnetic ﬁeld values for the conditions k⊥Max

To derive nonlocal transport relations, we follow the method of Ref. [10] and ﬁrst solve an

initial value problem for Eq. (5). In a weakly collisional plasma the perturbation at t = 0

provides a driver for transport processes. We postulate the initial δf0 to be the linearized
Maxwellian EDF, which is deﬁned by density and temperature perturbations δne |t=0

and employ them to eliminate δn(0) and δT (0) from Eq.

expressed in terms of its instantaneous hydrodynamic moments δne and δTe and vectors u

because of the speciﬁc form of equation (8), which deﬁnes Ψu as a linear combination of

nonlocal transport coeﬃcients (A2) are functions of the wave vector and can be calculated

by using solutions to the equations for the basic functions (8).

Equations (13) represent the main results of our theory. They deﬁne constitutive relations

for electron ﬂuxes in terms of thermodynamic forces. Transport relations (13) are linear

in the temperature gradient and in a generalized ﬁeld, similarly to local relations of the

collision dominated hydrodynamics [1]. The nonlocality of expressions (13) is displayed

in terms of convolutions in the conﬁgurational space involving temperature gradient and

generalized electric ﬁeld, and kernels which are deﬁned by the set of nonlocal transport

coeﬃcients. This new form of transport theory generalizes previous results [10] by including

magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects. The interplay between weakly collisional and magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects

on transport theory is still poorly understood. However it can play an important role in the

hydrodynamical evolution of laser produced plasmas as was demonstrated by the numerical

simulations in Ref. [6].

Ω/νT

The transport coeﬃcients (A2) depend on the following set of parameters: kkλei, k⊥ρ,
ei, and Z, where ρ = vT e/Ω is the electron Larmor radius and νT

≡
vT e/λei is the electron–ion collision frequency for thermal electrons [1]. In Sec. V the equiv-
alent set of independent parameters: kλei (nonlocality parameter), Ω/νT

IV. TRANSPORT THEORY OF A STRONGLY COLLISIONAL PLASMA

i.e. Zk2λ2

Transport coeﬃcients given by (24) are the same as the results of Ref. [19], where a detailed

comparison with the strongly collisional results of Braginskii [1] was made. Reference [19]

V. NONLOCAL TRANSPORT COEFFICIENTS

In this section we will describe the dependence of the transport coeﬃcients on the colli-

sionality parameter, kλei, for diﬀerent values of the Hall parameter: Ω/νT

ei = 0.1

100. We

−

start with the longitudinal transport coeﬃcients. In the local transport theory the longitu-

dinal coeﬃcients do not depend on magnetic ﬁeld. This is not true in general for nonlocal

transport, except for the special case when the direction of the plasma inhomogeneity is

along the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld (k

kk). In the general case (k

= kk) the depen-

≡
dence of transport coeﬃcients, including longitudinal coeﬃcients, on the magnetic ﬁeld is

deﬁned by the symmetric part of the EDF which is a function of k⊥ρ.

10

6
In the case of weak plasma inhomogeneity along the magnetic ﬁeld, k⊥ ≫

kk, transport

coeﬃcients σk and χk normalized to their classical strongly collisional values are shown in

Figs. 1 and 2 as functions of the collisionality parameter kλei. The nonlocality of transport

coeﬃcients is characterized by very diﬀerent functional dependence on kλei depending on the

magnitude of the Hall parameter, Ω/νT

ei. For small values of the Hall parameter, Ω/νT

ei < 1,

the transport coeﬃcients steadily decrease with increasing kλei. However, as shown in Figs.
1 and 2, they can exceed the standard classical values at kλei & 1 for Ω/νT

ei > 1. Note, that
the regime of kλei & 1 can still be within the validity condition of our theory, kkλei < 1,
when the plasma gradients are almost transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. k⊥ ≫

kk.
Transport in the case of a strong plasma inhomogeneity along magnetic ﬁeld k⊥ ≪
similar to the well known zero magnetic ﬁeld case [10], therefore the next example considered
is for k⊥ ∼
kk. Figures 3 and 4 show transport coeﬃcients σk and χk as functions of kλei
for k⊥ = kk. This corresponds to an angle of 45◦ between the magnetic ﬁeld vector and the

kk is

direction of a linear gradient. As it is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 electrical and temperature

conductivities increase with magnetic ﬁeld reaching maximum values at Ω/νT

curves 3 in both Figs. 3 and 4). Further increases in the parameter Ω/νT

0.3 (cf.

ei ≈
ei results in a small

decrease in the coeﬃcients σk and χk. At large values of Ω/νT

ei, they asymptotically approach

curves 4 in Figs. 3 and 4. In general, the longitudinal transport coeﬃcients display smaller

eﬀects of nonlocality for larger magnetic ﬁeld values.

Unlike the longitudinal coeﬃcients, the perpendicular and oblique transport coeﬃcients

demonstrate strong dependence on magnetic ﬁeld. To illustrate this, coeﬃcients σ∧,⊥ and

χ∧,⊥ are shown in Figs. 5 - 8 as functions of collisionality parameter for diﬀerent magnetic

ﬁeld values. In general, a strong magnetic ﬁeld suppresses the eﬀects of nonlocality. For

instance, the transverse temperature conductivity, χ⊥, is practically independent of the
collisionality parameter over the entire range of variations, kλei < 1, at Ω/νT
5 in Fig. 6). As in the longitudinal transport case, the coeﬃcients σ∧,⊥ (Fig. 5) and αq
increase slightly with the collisionality parameter at Ω/νT

1. One can also see that

ei = 3 (curve

∧,⊥

ei ≫

nonlocal eﬀects are stronger for oblique transport coeﬃcients as compared to transversal

coeﬃcients (c.f. Fig. 5 and Fig. 7, and Fig. 6 and Fig. 8).

Figure 9 shows the ratio of the perpendicular to the longitudinal temperature conductiv-

ities as a function of Hall parameter. This ratio increases with the value of the nonlocality

parameter, kλei. Hence, in a plasma with steep gradients, the inhibition of electron ﬂuxes

11

due to a magnetic ﬁeld is not as pronounced as in the strongly collisional case. This corre-

sponds to an increase in the eﬀective collision frequency (decrease of a mean free path) in

the nonlocal limit [10]. The kinetic eﬀect of reducing the electron mean free path due to

parameter (Ω/νT

transport nonlocality was included in recent 2D hydrodynamical simulations [6] by replacing
ei)2 where d is a constant that should be deﬁned from the
solution to the FP equation. However, our results demonstrate that the phenomenological

ei)2 with d (Ω/νT

constant d should be more correctly replaced by a function of the gradient scale length, kλei.

To complete our discussion of nonlocal, magnetic ﬁeld dependent transport coeﬃcients,

note that the analysis of kλei and Ω/νT
ei dependencies can be performed for all other coef-
ﬁcients, αc, ˆσ, and ˆα. These are explicitly calculated in Appendix A. As in the nonlocal

transport case without a magnetic ﬁeld [10], the coeﬃcients αc in the present theory may

change signs at some wave numbers. The tensor coeﬃcients, ˆα and ˆα, are negligible as

Ω/νT

ei →

0, in agreement with the local transport theory [1]. They are also very small for

the case of a strong magnetic ﬁeld Ω/νT

. This is the reason why these coeﬃcients

contribute to the electron ﬂuxes only at Ω/νT

ei → ∞

Depending on plasma conditions, nonlocal eﬀects may change the damping of MHD

modes. This is shown in Figs. 10b and 11b for a propagation angle of 80◦ with respect

to the direction of a magnetic ﬁeld. The almost transverse direction of the vector k allows

examination of the high kλei values in Figs. 10 and 11 within the applicability limits of our

eic)2 and h2 = (Ω/νT

pressure) case. Note, that we do not discuss eﬀects of ion viscosity. This can be included

independently by using the standard approach of Ref. [20].

In a high-β plasma all modes except the fast MHD wave experience the usual collisional

damping. The damping of the fast MHD wave in this case is unchanged up to the wavenum-

ber k

0.3/λei and is enhanced at higher wavenumbers (Fig. 10b). It can reach values up to

≃

an order of magnitude higher than the damping rates given by the usual collisional approach

[20] close to the short wave length applicability limit of our model. In a low-β plasma, the

slow MHD wave and the ion-acoustic wave can experience enhanced damping due to nonlocal

eﬀects (Fig. 11b) while the fast MHD mode has the usual damping. The enhanced damping

of the slow MHD wave appears at k > 0.1/λei and remains up to k

3/λei until the slow

MHD wave becomes a second ion cyclotron wave. At the same wavenumber, k

3/λei, the

≃

≃

ion-acoustic wave appears (the curve 2 in Fig. 11). The damping of ion-acoustic wave can

be much higher than the standard collisional damping. This agrees with the result of Ref.

[2] because of the negligible role that is played by the magnetic ﬁeld in this case.

VII. RELAXATION OF HOT SPOT TEMPERATURE IN A MAGNETIC FIELD.

Current laser plasma interaction experiments involve random phase plate laser beams

which control the intensity distribution in the focal plane. This makes a hot spot geometry

14

for the temperature inhomogeneity a basic element of transport theory in such plasmas.

Typically the characteristic scales of the temperature gradient are in the regime of nonlocal

transport. A self-generated magnetic ﬁeld has also been well documented in such plasmas.

Its existence motivates the discussion below, where we apply our transport theory to a single

hot spot transport problem with magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects included.

We consider the relaxation of a single hot spot in a plasma with a given magnetic ﬁeld.

The geometry of our model involves an initial temperature perturbation with cylindrical

symmetry which evolves due to thermal transport. The magnetic ﬁeld is assumed orthogonal

to the radial temperature gradient, i.e.

it can have only Bz or Bϕ components. We will

examine conditions in laser produced plasmas where magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects inﬂuance transport

in the nonlocal regime. The solution of the initial value problem follows Ref. [22], where the

relaxation of a hot spot was studied in an unmagnetized plasma. A temperature perturbation

in a cylindrical hot spot is assumed to have a Gaussian proﬁle

at time, t = 0. We also assume that the plasma ﬂow has a negligible eﬀect on the temperature

and electron heat ﬂux proﬁles are presented in Fig. 12 for the magnetic ﬁeld corresponding

to Hall parameter Ω/νT

ei = 0.3. The result of the classical transport approach [16] (dashed

line) overestimates the electron heat ﬂux (Fig. 12b). Because of this reason, the hot spot

temperature obtained from local theory [16] decreases faster (Fig. 12a) than predictions

from Eq. (32). As discussed in the previous section, a combination of the magnetic ﬁeld

and nonlocal eﬀects leads to a slightly larger heat ﬂux and smaller temperature as compared

to the nonlocal and unmagnetized case. This is illustrated by dotted (present theory) and

continuous lines (nonlocal and unmagnetized theory from Ref. [22]) in Fig. 12.

As expected, eﬀects of nonlocal thermal transport become negligible with increasing

values of the magnetic ﬁeld. This is illustrated by Fig. 13, where the relaxation time

15

(the time necessary for the temperature in the center of the hot spot to drop to half of

its initial value) is shown as a function of the hot spot size, R/λei for diﬀerent magnetic
ﬁelds. For R/λei & 3 and Ω/νT
parameters, Ω/νT

ei = 1 the eﬀect of nonlocality almost vanishes. For small Hall
ei . 0.1, the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld on the temperature relaxation can
ei < 1 both magnetic

be ignored. For the intermediate magnetic ﬁeld strength 0.1 < Ω/νT

ﬁeld and nonlocal eﬀects are important and their interplay deﬁnes the relaxation of the hot

spot temperature.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have applied a systematic closure procedure [10] to a magnetized plasma in the

regime of moderate collisionality where kkλei < 1 and k⊥ < Max
{

1/ρ, 1/λei}

. We have

derived nonlocal hydrodynamic equations which are valid for small perturbations about

an equilibrium homogeneous state and for a plasma with high ionic charge. Our transport

theory is fully equivalent to the linearized electron kinetic equation but possesses advantages

of the reduced model which describes plasma in terms of just few moments of the distribution

function. The closure procedure provides nonlocal relations between electron ﬂuxes and

gradients in the plasma density and electron temperature, and an electrostatic ﬁeld. These

tensor transport relations account for all orientations of the magnetic ﬁeld and the plasma

gradients: longitudinal, oblique, and transverse.

Competition between nonlocal and magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects is poorly understood and our

theory provides a rigorous means of examining the relative importance of both factors. We

have found that large magnetic ﬁelds contribute to the enhancement of electron conduc-

tivity in the weakly collisional regime. This increase can oﬀset inhibition due to nonlocal

eﬀects. This is an important eﬀect that is necessary to explain transport phenomena in laser

produced plasmas [6]. The practical importance of our theory lies in providing benchmark

results for comparisons with the phenomenological models such as Ref. [6] or future kinetic

simulations (cf. Refs. [13, 28]).

We have described the application of nonlocal hydrodynamics to the MHD wave disper-

sion and damping calculations and to hot spot temperature relaxation. There are important

enhancements to collisional damping of MHD modes in the nonlocal transport regime. The

presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld is the main source of thermal transport inhibition in the

16

relaxation of a hot spot. For the intermediate values, 0.1 < Ω/νT

ei < 1, the hot spot displays

the simultaneous eﬀects of electron gyro motion and nonlocal transport.

Our results provide a next step in the ongoing eﬀorts to develop a plasma hydrodynamics

model which is valid for the wide range of plasma conditions and includes nonlinear re-

sponse to large amplitude perturbations. The application of linear theory to experimental

data, such as [5, 6, 24, 25], and comparison with kinetic simulations and its generalization

to include local dependence on plasma parameters, as in Ref. [14], could lead to a nonlocal

nonlinear transport theory in magnetized plasmas. Linear nonlocal hydrodynamics models

provide a description of the plasma thermal response to electromagnetic radiation in stimu-

lated Brillouin scattering, ﬁlamentation and in the ﬁlament resonant instability [23, 26, 27].

Current results will allow generalization of these processes to the case of magnetized plasmas.

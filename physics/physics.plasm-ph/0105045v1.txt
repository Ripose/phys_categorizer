The inﬂuence of the ﬁnite number N of particles cou-
pled to a monochromatic wave in a collisionless plasma is
investigated. For growth as well as damping of the wave,
discrete particle numerical simulations show an N -dependent
long time behavior resulting from the dynamics of individ-
ual particles. This behavior diﬀers from the one due to the
numerical errors incurred by Vlasov approaches. Trapping
oscillations are crucial to long time dynamics, as the wave
oscillations are controlled by the particle distribution inho-
mogeneities and the pulsating separatrix crossings drive the
relaxation towards thermal equilibrium.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is tempting to expect that kinetic equations and
their numerical simulation provide a fair description of
the time evolution of systems with long-range or ‘global’
interactions. Yet, physical systems are obviously com-
posed of a ﬁnite (albeit large) number of degrees of free-
dom. For instance, a plasma is a system of N charged
particles in interaction. A relevant issue, both for fun-
damental and computational reasons, is to test whether
the kinetic description may hide truly physical, ﬁnite-N ,
behaviors.

We address this issue for a typical example where long-
range interactions come into play, namely wave-particle
interactions, which are ubiquitous in the physics of hot
plasmas [1–3].

Restricting to the electrostatic and collisionless case,
it has been shown that the interaction of resonant par-
ticles with Langmuir long-wavelength modes can be de-
scribed by a Hamiltonian self-consistent model, instead
of the traditional Vlasov-Poisson kinetic approach. We
consider the case where particles interact with a single

1

mode. In Section II, we present the single-wave Hamilto-
nian model, whose universal features were recently em-
phasized in diﬀerent contexts [2,3]. The essential prop-
erty of this model is its mean-ﬁeld nature : resonant
particles only interact with the wave, which is the only
eﬀective collective degree of freedom representing longi-
tudinal oscillations of bulk particles. These bulk par-
ticles, whose individual characters are absent from the
physical mechanism at work, namely wave-particle inter-
action, are then eliminated in our approach. There are
thus no direct particle-particle interactions in our model.
There is only a mean-ﬁeld coupling, which enables one to
derive rather directly its kinetic limit [4]. We use this sin-
gle wave-particle model to investigate the discrepancies
between kinetic and ﬁnite-N approaches. Numerically,
the ﬁnite-N Hamiltonian microscopic dynamics is com-
puted through a symplectic code, whereas the numerical
implementation of the kinetic counterpart of this system
involves a semi-Lagrangian Vlasov solver.

In Section III, we focus on long time numerical sim-
ulations of both kinetic and ﬁnite-N systems for initial
conditions modeling bump-on-tail beam-plasma instabil-
ity or damping. We review the well-known results of
linear theory and show how long time behaviors are in-
trinsically related to the non-linear regime. Our model
oﬀers a good alternative to address the recently contro-
versial issue [5,6] of the long-time evolution encountered
in the Vlasov-Poisson system. In Section IV, we analyse
quantitatively the ﬁnite-N eﬀects. In particular, we show
how the discrepancies between kinetic and ﬁnite-N long
time behaviors can be related to the presently actively
investigated topics of the possible inadequacy of Gibbs
thermodynamics to predict time-asymptotic dynamical
behaviors in the limit N
for long-range systems.

II. MEAN-FIELD MODEL FOR THE LANGMUIR
WAVE-PARTICLE INTERACTION

A. Links between the traditional Vlasov-Poisson
treatment of Langmuir waves and the self-consistent
wave-particle Hamiltonian model

Without collisions, plasma dynamics is dominated by
collective processes. Langmuir waves and their famil-
iar Landau damping and growth [7] are a good example
of these processes, with many applications, e.g. plasma
heating in fusion devices and laser-plasma interactions.
For simplicity we focus on the one-dimensional case, rel-
evant to electrons conﬁned by a strong axial magnetic
ﬁeld, and assume that ions act as a neutralizing ﬁxed
background. The traditional description of the interact-
ing particles and ﬁelds then rests on the (kinetic) coupled
set of Vlasov-Poisson equations [8,9]. The current debate
on the long-time evolution of this system hints that fur-
ther insight in this fundamental process is still needed
[5].

Our approach to (Langmuir) wave-particle interaction
complements this usual treatment in that, to capture the
physical mechanism at work, electrons are partitioned
in two populations : bulk and tail. The idea behind
this discrimination is simple : wave-particle interaction
involves the resonant tail particles whose velocity is close
to the phase velocity of the wave under consideration.
These waves are just the collective macroscopic degrees of
freedom, capturing the longitudinal oscillations of other
non-resonant, bulk particles, so that these bulk particles
participate in the eﬀective wave-particle dynamics only
through the waves.

Langmuir modes are thus collective oscillations of bulk
particles, represented by slowly varying complex am-
plitudes in an envelope approximation. Their interac-
tion with individual tail particles is described by a self-
consistent set of Hamiltonian equations [1,10,11]. These
already provided an eﬃcient basis [12] for investigating
the cold beam plasma instability and exploring the non-
linear regime of the bump-on-tail instability [13]. Analyt-
ically, they yield an intuitive and rigorous derivation of
spontaneous emission and Landau damping of Langmuir
waves [14]. Besides, as it eliminates the rapid plasma
oscillation scale ω−1
p , this self-consistent model oﬀers a
genuine tool to investigate long-time dynamics.

B. The single wave model

We discuss the case of one wave interacting with the
particles. Though a broad spectrum of unstable waves is
generally excited when tail particles form a warm beam,
the single-wave situation can be realized experimentally
[15] and allows leaving aside the diﬃcult problem of mode
coupling mediated by resonant particles [16]. Moreover,
recent studies [2,3] have stressed the genericness of the
single-wave model, which we discuss later on.

resonant electrons contribute only through the deﬁnition
of the dielectric function ǫ, so that φk and the zl’s obey

C. Kinetic limit and study of ﬁnite-N eﬀects

As we follow the motion of each particle, we can ad-
dress the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite number of particles on the
long-time behavior of the system. This question is eluded
by the kinetic Vlasov-Poisson description, and one might
argue that ﬁnite N is analogous to numerical discreti-
sation in solving kinetic equations. Thus we investigate

2

→ ∞

the kinetic limit, N
. As there is no direct particle-
particle interaction in our model (5), it is possible to
limit through a
express in a simple way the N
parallel treatment of the particles and the wave. The
mean-ﬁeld coupling between collective (wave) and indi-
vidual (particles) degrees of freedom enables one to avoid
the derivation of a full BBGKY hierarchy.

For initial data approaching a smooth function f as
, the solutions of (3)-(4) have been proved to

converge to those of the Vlasov-wave system (6)-(7) over
any ﬁnite time interval [4]. This legitimizes our compar-
ison between ﬁnite N and kinetic behaviors.

The kinetic model (6)-(7) is integrated numerically by
a semi-Lagrangian solver, which covers the (x, p) space
with a rectangular mesh. The function f (interpolated
by cubic splines) is transported along the characteristic
lines of the kinetic equation, i.e. along trajectories of the
original particles [17]. Therefore, in addition to the truly
physical eﬀects of the discrepancies between ﬁnite N and
kinetic systems on long time simulations, we shall also
compare in this article computational ﬁnite grid eﬀects
of the kinetic solver with the granular aspects of the N -
particle system [18].

D. Universal features of the single-wave model

The single wave model was ﬁrst formulated [12,10] as
a simpliﬁed model to treat the instability due to a weak
cold electron beam in a plasma with ﬁxed ions. For this
singular case, it was clear that retaining only a single
Langmuir mode was a good approximation even till some
primary stage of non-linear saturation. This derivation
involved natural approximations, but did not a priori
preserve the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian structure of the
dynamics (though the latter is recovered in the ﬁnal equa-
tions), and a more direct derivation within the Hamil-
tonian and Lagrangian formalism has been established
[1,11].

Recently, diﬀerent studies [2,3] have extended the
regime of application of the single-wave model to a much
larger class of instabilities and have derived it in a generic
way in diﬀerent contexts.

J.D. Crawford and A. Jayaraman [2] studied the colli-
sionless nonlinear evolution of a weakly unstable mode,

→

0+. They de-
in the limit of a vanishing growth rate γ
rived in this limit, for a multispecies Vlasov plasma, the
asymptotic features of the electric ﬁeld and distribution
functions. These reveal that the asymptotic electric ﬁeld
turns out to be monochromatic (at the wavelength of the
linear unstable mode) and that the nonresonant parti-
cles respond to this electric ﬁeld in an essentially linear
fashion whereas the resonant particle distribution has a
much more complicated structure, determined by non-
linear processes, e.g. particle trapping. That is, starting
from a much wider class of instabilities than the origi-
nal single wave model proposed by O’Neil, Winfrey and
Malmberg [12], Crawford and Jayaraman derive asymp-
totic forms for the electric ﬁeld and distribution functions
that precisely feature the assumptions for the single wave
model.

D. del-Castillo-Negrete [3] derived initially the single
wave picture using matched asymptotic methods to treat
the resonant and nonresonant particles.
In the wider
context of self-consistent chaotic transport in ﬂuid dy-
namics, he also showed that the single-wave model pro-
vided a simpliﬁed starting point to study the diﬃcult
problem of active transport (as opposed to the trans-
port of passive scalars which do not aﬀect the ﬂow). Ac-
tually, the single-wave model captures the essential fea-
tures of the self-consistent transport of vorticity, i.e. an
advective ﬁeld that modiﬁes the ﬂow while being trans-
ported, through the constraint of a vorticity-velocity cou-
pling. Self-consistent active transport is a ubiquitous
phenomenon in geophysical ﬂows or in fusion plasmas
with the problem of magnetic conﬁnement.

Finally, we remark that the single wave model has close
connections, to be further clariﬁed, with systems of cou-
pled nonlinear oscillators, such as those ﬁrst studied by
Kuramoto [19]. The occurrence of a phase transition in
the regime of Landau damping [20], with order parameter
the mean-ﬁeld intensity of the wave, is a manifestation
of these analogies.

Now we return to the original motivation of this work

and review wave-beam instability and damping.

III. WAVE-BEAM INSTABILITY

A. Linear study

Let us ﬁrst study linear instabilities and remark that
one solution of (3)-(4) corresponds to vanishing ﬁeld
V0 = 0, with particles evenly distributed on a ﬁnite set of
beams with given velocities. Small perturbations of this
solution have δV = δV0eγt, with rate γ solving [14]

For a monokinetic beam with velocity U , (8) reduces to
γ(γ + iU )2 = i ; the most unstable solution occurs for
U = 0, with γr = √3/2 and γi = 1/2. For a warm
beam with smooth initial distribution f (p) (normalized

part, i.e. with growth rate γr ≈
negative slope, one recovers the linear Landau damping
paradox [7] : the observed decay rate γL = πf ′(0) <
0 is not associated with genuine eigenvalues, but with
phase mixing of eigenmodes [14,20–22]. This is a direct
consequence of the Hamiltonian nature of the dynamics

For the growing case, nonlinearities result from the
growth of the wave intensity. For the damping case, the
linear description introduces time secularities which ulti-
mately may cause the linear theory to break down. The
ultimate evolution is intrinsically nonlinear, not only if
the initial ﬁeld amplitude is large, as in O’Neil’s seminal
trapping picture for one wave [8], but also if one con-
siders the system evolution over time scales of the order
of the trapping time (which may be large if the initial
wave amplitude is small). The question of the long-time
fate of plasma wave amplitude is thus far from trivial
[5]. Though some simulations [24] suggest that nonlinear
plasma waves eventually approach a Bernstein-Greene-
Kruskal steady state [25] instead of a Landau vanishing
ﬁeld, the answer should rather strongly depend on ini-
tial conditions [6]. Our N -particle, 1-wave system is the
simplest model to test these ideas.

This linear analysis generally fails to give the large
time behavior. This is obvious for the unstable case as
non-linear eﬀects are no longer negligible when the wave
intensity grows so that the bounce frequency ωb(t) =
of trapped particles in the wave becomes of the

2

order of the linear growth rate γr.
p

We used the monokinetic case as a testbed [21,23]. As
seen in Fig. 1, ﬁnite-N simulations show that the un-
stable solution grows as predicted, until it saturates to
a limit-cycle-like behavior where the trapping frequency
ωb(t) oscillates between 1.2γr and 2γr.
In this regime,
some of the initially monokinetic particles have been
scattered rather uniformly over the chaotic domain, in
and around the pulsating resonance, while others form a
trapped bunch inside this resonance (away from the sep-
aratrix) as observed in Fig. 2 [23]. This dynamics is quite
well described by eﬀective Hamiltonians with few degrees
of freedom [11,21]. Note that it cannot be easily followed
by a numerical Vlasov solver, as the initial beam has a
singular velocity distribution function.

In this article, we discuss the large time behavior of
the warm beam case, with f ′(p0)
= 0 at the wave nomi-
nal velocity p0 = 0. Figure 3 displays three distribution
functions (in dimensionless form) with similar velocity

First of all let us mention that for ﬁnite N , the particles
are initially distributed in (x, p) so that their distribution
approaches f smoothly in the large N limit [1,13,14].

A. The damping case

→ ∞

A thermodynamical analysis [20] predicts that, for a
warm beam (i.e. if the velocity distribution f has a large
width, as in Fig. 3) and small enough initial wave am-
plitude, ωb asymptotically scales as N −1/2 in the limit
N
. Figure 4 shows the evolution of a small ampli-
tude wave launched in the beam. The N -particle system
(curve N) and the kinetic system (curve V) initially damp
exponentially as predicted by perturbation theory [14],
−1. After that phase-mixing
for a time of the order of
γL|
|
time, trapping induces nonlinear evolution and both sys-
tems evolve diﬀerently. For the N -particle system, the
wave grows to a thermal level that scales as N −1/2, corre-
sponding to a balance between damping and spontaneous
emission [14,20]. For the kinetic system, initial Landau
damping is followed by slowly damped trapping oscilla-
tions around a mean value ; this mean value also decays
to zero, at a rate which decreases for reﬁned mesh size.
Figure 4 thus reveals that ﬁnite N and Vlasov behav-
iors can considerably diverge as spontaneous emission is
taken into account.

Figure 5 represents the time evolution of the wave am-
It clearly shows how

→ ∞

ﬁnite-N wave evolutions depart progressively from the
N
curve (the later for larger N ). One should also
notice, from Figs 4 and 5 and for suﬃciently large N ,
the onset of nonlinear eﬀects at large time. In spite of
the smallness of the initial values of the wave amplitude,
nonlinear eﬀects (through trapping) eventually come into
play and stop Landau exponential decay, marking the
beginning of a diﬀerent dynamical regime for which the
decay is far slower.

B. The single wave warm beam instability

Now consider a warm beam with a velocity distribu-
tion with a positive slope at p0 = 0. Line N1 (resp.
N2) of Fig. 6 displays ln(ωb(t)/γr) versus time in a nu-
merical integration of (3)-(4) for a CG distribution with
N = 128000 (resp. 512000) and γr = 0.08. Line V1 (resp.
V2) shows the evolution of ln(ωb(t)/γr) versus γrt in nu-
merical integration of the kinetic system for the same
initial conditions with a 32
1024) grid
×
in (x, p) space. All four curves exhibit the same initial
exponential growth of linear theory with less than 1% er-
3.1
ror on the growth rate. Saturation occurs for ωb/γr ≈
[9]. Lines N1 and V1 do not superpose beyond the ﬁrst
trapping oscillation after saturation. Note that, in our
system, oscillating saturation cannot be related to ex-
citation of sideband or satellite Langmuir waves as our
single-wave Hamiltonian does not allow for any spectrum
of waves.

128 (resp. 256

×

Beyond the ﬁrst trapping oscillation, kinetic simula-
tions exhibit a second growth at a rate controlled by mesh
size. Line V2 suggests that a kinetic approach would pre-
dict a level close to the trapping saturation level on a time
scale awarded by reasonable integration time. This level
is fairly below the thermodynamic level Vth predicted by
a Gibbsian approach [20]. Such pathological relaxation
properties in the N
limit seem common to mean-
ﬁeld long-range models [26]. Both kinetic simulations
also exhibit a strong damping of trapping oscillations,
which disappear after a few oscillations, whereas ﬁnite-
N simulations show persistent trapping oscillations.

→ ∞

One could expect that ﬁnite-N eﬀects would mainly
damp these oscillations, so that the wave amplitude
reaches a plateau. However their amplitude does not
depend on the number of particles N , which shows that
they are not an artifact due to ‘poor accuracy’ of ﬁnite-N
simulations. Moreover the wave amplitude slowly grows
further, whereas the velocity distribution function ﬂat-
tens over wider intervals of velocity [18,23].

This second growth after the ﬁrst trapping saturation
depends on the shape of the initial distribution function.
In Fig. 6(b), curve N2 is the same as in Fig. 6(a) but
computed over a longer duration, and curve N3 corre-
sponds to N = 64000 with the TL distribution of Fig. 3.

Although curve N3 corresponds to 8 times fewer parti-
cles than curve N2, the ﬁnal level reached at the end of
In the second growth regime,
the simulation is lower.
particles are transported further in velocity, so that the
plateau in f (p) broadens with time. As will be clearly
shown in Sec. D, this spreading is due to separatrix cross-
ing, i.e. successive trapping and detrapping by the wave
[23]. As the resonance width of the wave separatrix
grows, the wave can trap particles with initial velocity
further away from its phase velocity. Noting that the TL
distribution decays while the CG distribution still grows
for v > 0.05, we see that, with TL, fewer particles can
give momentum to the wave when being trapped (as
P
is conserved) ; hence the second growth is slower for the
TL distribution.

We followed the evolution of the wave amplitude of
curve N3 of Fig. 6(b) up to γrt = 1750. Starting from the
ﬁrst trapping saturation level, equal to 40% of the ther-
modynamic level Vth, we observe persistent amplitude
ﬂuctuations with a growth rate that slowly decreases as
we reach 0.78Vth at the end of the computation.

Line N4 of Fig. 6(b) corresponds to the TL distribu-
tion with 2048000 particles and shows persistent oscil-
lations with approximately the same amplitude as for
N = 64000.

C. Trapping oscillations

Let us show that the occurrence of trapping oscillations
with non-vanishing amplitude follows from the existence
of spatial inhomogeneities. For this purpose, introduce

∆V scales at most as N −1/2 and vanishes in the kinetic
limit.

A striking example is given by the cold beam-wave in-
stability [11], for which a macroscopic fraction of the par-
ticles belong to a so-called macroparticle that oscillates
near the bottom (elliptic point) of the potential well and
drives the wave amplitude oscillations as shown in Fig. 2.
Another illustration of (18) is given by Figs 2 and 4 of
ref. [6]. In Vlasov simulations, as the spatial resolution
Nx is increased, one observes a more reﬁned phase space
that reveals some heterogeneities for the larger value of
Nx. This simultaneously goes with pronounced trapping
oscillations at large Nx while the rough resolution, which
has smeared out the thin ﬁlamentation in the vortices, is
associated to a ﬂat, constant amplitude in time.

D. Finite-N eﬀects, trapping oscillations and
relaxation towards thermal equilibrium through
chaos

We now discuss the actual process by which the wave-
particle system relaxes. For this purpose, one can get a

ﬂavor of the stochasticity (strong or weak depending on
resonance overlapping or not) that a test particle would
encounter in (x, p) space at diﬀerent stages of the evolu-
tion.

(15)

system (5)

(19)

the time dependence of the wave modulates the force on
the test particle.
If V is approximately periodic over
a time interval of length T , and if its period is large
compared with the trapped particle bouncing period, the
pulsations of the separatrix generate strong chaos in the
domain of (x, p) space it sweeps [28]. In the present case,
the period of V is basically the trapped particles’ bounc-
ing period, which makes the ‘slow chaos’ approximation
rather crude.

The chaos generated by a pulsating separatrix can
also be characterized using the Fourier decomposition

of the wave V (t) =
exp(iωnt + χn), with
ωn=−∞ |
ωn = 2πn/T . Then the test particle experiences a force
deriving from an eﬀective many-wave ﬁeld (though the

and the overlaps between resonances in this force ﬁeld
cause the particle to move chaotically [29].

We computed the Fourier decomposition of ωb(t) for
the warm beam with initial distribution TL over two
diﬀerent time intervals, one (window T1) just after the

N = 48000 and N = 768000 particles. The low fre-
quency bias induced by the slow growth of the amplitude
evolution has been removed by subtracting the quadratic

with γLt0 = 38 or 250. Figs 7 and 8 show coeﬃcients
an/a0 as a function of the frequency normalized by ωb0,
the fundamental n = 0 being removed. Such a nor-
malized form enables a direct comparison between the
ﬁgures (irrespective of N and T ). Below we use co-
eﬃcients abn = an′, where n′
is the index such that
ωn′ = n′2π/T = nωb0.

During the ﬁrst stage T1 (Fig. 7), the behavior appears
almost entirely driven for large N by a narrow spectrum

of frequencies of the order of the average trapping fre-
quency, although, for N = 48000, other Fourier compo-
nents are excited.

Two types of chaos must be distinguished. The sim-
plest one is related to the classical overlap between the
resonances of two waves [29] propagating at velocities
mωb0 and nωb0. The corresponding chaos is ‘fast’,
namely the frequencies of the relevant resonances are
larger than ωb0. The stochasticity parameter [30] esti-
mated as

is small for all m
= 0. This means that the
eﬀective many-wave ﬁeld does not generate strong chaos
in velocity ranges away from the wave nominal velocity.
Similarly, one may search for chaos induced by the
overlap between the component in (20) with phase ve-
locity ωbn > 2ωb0, and the central resonance, with
phase velocity 0. Their resonance overlap [30] parameter
s0,n = (2√a0 + √2abn)/
2/n is not large enough
nωb0| ≈
|
in our system to induce large scale chaos, transporting
particles from the neighborhood of the wave nominal ve-
locity (with its natural width 2ωb0) to the neighborhood
of waves with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent phase velocities.

The second type of chaos is related to the resonant
forcing by Fourier components with phase velocity ωbn <
∼
2ωb0, on the periodic motion induced by the main ﬁeld
component. This process applies in the vicinity of the
separatrix of the main resonance and must be discussed
using action-angle variables. As recalled in the appendix,
the corresponding pulsations are smaller than 2ωb0 for
untrapped particles, and smaller than ωb0 for trapped
particles (and for untrapped ones very close to the sepa-
ratrix). Particles experiencing this chaos easily cross the
pulsating separatrix, i.e. change between trapped and
untrapped motion.

The Fourier spectra in Fig. 7 show that the second
process is active, since only ω <
ωb0 lead to signiﬁcant
∼
amplitudes abn. This supports the analysis of chaos in
our system as ‘slow chaos’ due to the pulsating resonance
[28]. However, corresponding amplitudes abn are much
smaller than a0. Therefore, the pulsating resonance does
not sweep the vicinity of the bottom of the wave potential
well, which allows the particles close to the elliptic point
to move quite regularly, forming a macroparticle like in
Fig. 2. This bottom of the well may be separated from
the surrounding chaotic domain (swept by the separatrix)
by KAM surfaces in (x, p, t) space [28].

The more chaotic behaviour is expected in the case
where the additional peaks, close to ωb0, 2ωb0 and 3ωb0,
are more important. As this is the case N = 48000, our
analysis is consistent with the faster transport in velocity

observed for the smaller values of N and thus with the
more rapid thermalization in this case.

Considering the later time interval T2 (Fig. 8), it is
striking to note that the diﬀerences between both spec-
tra are strongly reduced, so that one can estimate that
a test particle feels a similar amount of stochasticity for
both values of N . Moreover, the relative intensity of the
secondary resonances is smaller than in the time inter-
val T1, so that the separatrix pulsations will be relatively
smaller. As a result, the chaotic growth of the wave also
slows down. By contrast, the Vlasov simulations, with
their induction of coarse graining, even prevent the evo-
lution of the system towards this second stage. Actually,
these codes are unable to capture the spatial details of
the phase space ﬁlamentation which are under the scale
of the mesh size, so that, after a certain stage, they arti-
ﬁcially make the system almost integrable.

E. (x, p)-space structures, smoothing and numerical
entropy production in the Vlasov model

Finally, our numerical observations along with equa-
tion (17) enable one to describe properly the ﬁnite-N
eﬀects on the thermalization process. Due to the ini-
tial asymmetry in velocity space (the initial distribution
function has a positive slope around the wave phase ve-
locity), heterogeneities will exist in the wave resonance
during the ﬁrst nonlinear oscillations. If N is increased,
the (weak) chaos available to thermalize the system dis-
appears, and the system is driven by the ﬁlamentary
structure which develops inside the wave potential well.
The bottom of the well is an elliptic point for the model,
around which the correlations between trajectories may
decay algebraically [31], so that the ﬁlaments get thinner
and more entangled as time goes on.

The ﬁlamentation described here mixes particles in the
neighborhood of the wave resonance. Particles with ve-
locities far away from the resonance are weakly sensi-
tive to the resonance, which they essentially average oﬀ.
Therefore, as N becomes very large, the system long-time
evolution is dependent on initial conditions in the neigh-
borhood of the resonance, and thermodynamical conclu-
sions (relying on ergodicity in the energy surface and ba-
sic conservation laws) no longer apply.

Now, to what extent do actual Vlasov simulations
reproduce either the kinetic equation evolution or the
ﬁnite-N evolution ? Crudely speaking, kinetic simula-
tions start to induce a bias with respect to the Vlasov
equation, because of phase space averaging, when the
distribution function exhibits structures on scales below
their grid resolution (and this is bound to happen). One
might expect that ﬁner grids would enable one to de-
scribe more precisely the long-time evolution of the sys-
tem. However, reﬁned grids also reduce the coarseness of
the particle distribution in (x, p) space, and inhibit the

equations, in which particles undergo noisy transport.

A. Appendix : Periodic orbits of the pendulum and
resonance overlap

The pendulum equations reduce to the normal form
(19) with ﬁxed parameters θ = 0 and ωb0. The orbits of
the pendulum in (x, p) space (with x modulo 2π) are :
ﬁxed points (0, 0) and (π, 0), the two branches of the sep-
aratrix and the three types of periodic orbits. They are
parametrized by the energy E = p2/2+ω2
0
and (if untrapped) by the sign of p. At the unstable ﬁxed

noisy separatrix crossings. This in turn inhibits the wave
second growth, which results from the coarseness of the
particle distribution for an actual ﬁnite value of N .

Our observations indicate that kinetic models are too
idealized, in comparison with ﬁnite N , and do not con-
tain all the intricate behavior displayed by a discrete par-
ticles system. This can also be tested within kinetic the-
ory. In particular, whereas the kinetic equation analyti-
cally preserves integral functionals of f like the 2-entropy
S2(t) =
f )f dxdp, numerical schemes increase S2
signiﬁcantly, as shown in Fig. 9, when constant-f con-
tours form ﬁlaments in (x, p)-space on scales below the
grid mesh. This ﬁlamentation (due to anisochronism of
nonlinear trapped motion, or shear in (x, p)-space) is
smoothed by numerical partial diﬀerential equation in-
tegrators, while N -body dynamics follows the particles
more realistically, sustaining the trapping oscillations.

This inability of the semi-Lagrangian scheme in re-
producing the ﬁlamentation over small scales is shared
by other Vlasov schemes. In particular, particle-in-cell
(PIC) schemes explicitly replace the actual N particles
of the initial dynamics by eﬀective particles, which are
redeﬁned smoothly at each time step. PIC schemes
have a further disadvantage in comparison with semi-
Lagrangian schemes. They put the numerical eﬀort on
cells according to their populations ; by contrast, semi-
Lagrangian schemes ensure a similar accuracy for the
poorly populated (x, p)-space domains as for the highly
populated ones [17], so that they describe frontiers in f
more sharply.

This discussion shows that the ‘irreversible’ growth of
the wave is not related to the entropy production of this
sub-grid-scale ﬁlamentation but to the chaotic trapping-
detrapping process (of which some small-scale structures
are by-products). Although the smoothing may appear
as a minor nuisance in the chaotic (x, p) regions, it does
actually force a distinctly diﬀerent evolution in the long
term, and reﬁning the mesh does not prevent this.

V. COMMENTS AND CONCLUSION

In summary, dealing with the basic propagation of
a single electrostatic wave in a warm plasma, we pre-
sented ﬁnite-N eﬀects which do not merely result from
numerical errors and are missed in a kinetic simulation
approach. Their understanding depends crucially on de-
scribing the particle dynamics in (x, p) space. The sen-
sitive dependence of the microscopic chaotic evolution
to the ﬁne structure of the initial particle distribution
in (x, p) space [21] implies that the limits t
and
N
do not commute. The driving process in the
system evolution is separatrix crossing, which requires
a geometric approach to the system dynamics. Further
work in this direction will also shed new light on the
foundations of frequently used approximations, such as

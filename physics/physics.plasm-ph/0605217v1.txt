The expansion instability of a toroidal current ring in low-beta magnetized plasma is investigated.
Qualitative agreement is obtained with experiments on spheromak expansion and with essential
properties of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs), unifying the two apparently disparate classes of
fast and slow CMEs.

We consider the expansion instability of a toroidal cur-
rent ring with the goal to describe the rapid expansion
of such rings or partial rings observed in laboratory and
astrophysical plasmas [1, 2]. The equilibrium of this con-
ﬁguration was established by Shafranov and is realized in
the tokamak fusion device [3]. It necessarily includes an
external poloidal magnetic ﬁeld Bex, since the Lorentz-
self force, also referred to as the hoop force, as well as
the net pressure gradient force of a bent current channel
always point radially outward.

The stability of the Shafranov equilibrium has been
considered by Bateman [4], who found that the ring is
unstable against expansion if the external poloidal ﬁeld
decreases suﬃciently rapidly in the direction of the major
torus radius R. Since the hoop force decreases if the ring
expands, a perturbation dR > 0 will be unstable if the
opposing Lorentz force due to Bex decreases faster with
increasing R than the hoop force. Bateman derived

n = −R d ln Bex/dR > 3/2

(1)

as condition for the instability, which we will refer to as
the torus instability (TI). If the ﬁeld is purely poloidal,
the TI can be regarded as a lateral kink instability dis-
tributed uniformly over the ring. If the equilibrium in-
cludes a toroidal ﬁeld component inside the torus, as e.g.
in the force-free case, the instability is driven in addition
by the tendency of the toroidal component to straighten
the ﬁeld lines (opposite to its eﬀect on the helical kink).
The TI is suppressed in fusion devices by employing ex-
ternal poloidal ﬁelds with suﬃciently small decay indices
n and by stabilizing image currents in the walls of the
device. However, it may occur in astrophysical plasmas,
where the external poloidal ﬁeld is often strongly inho-
mogeneous [5], and in some plasma experiments [1, 6, 7].
In particular, the observations of erupting prominences
on the Sun, which often evolve into the cores of coronal
mass ejections (CMEs) causing major perturbations of
the space weather [8], suggest the topology of a single
expanding partial current ring, whose footpoints are an-
chored in the inertial visible solar surface. A threshold
of n > 2 was estimated for this case [5]; otherwise the
instability has apparently never been reconsidered. Re-
search on CMEs was instead directed at the possibility of
a catastrophe due to nonexistence of equilibrium in part

of parameter space [2, 9].

In the present Letter we derive a TI threshold that is
somewhat more general than Eq. (1) and treat the evo-
lution of the instability for the ﬁrst time. We consider
two cases: a freely expanding ring relevant in the labo-
ratory and for CMEs, and an expanding ring with con-
stant total current, which captures an important eﬀect of
the footpoint anchoring on an expanding partial ring and
can be relevant in the initial stage of CMEs. We focus
on the essence of the instability and its development by
including only the hoop force (in the large aspect ratio
approximation, R ≫ b) and the stabilizing Lorentz force
due to Bex. Gravity, pressure, external toroidal ﬁelds,
and any variation in the direction of the minor radius b
are neglected to permit a largely analytical description.
The neglect of pressure eﬀects is justiﬁed by the fact that
the instability is primarily relevant for low-beta plasmas,
in which the conversion of the stored magnetic energy
is able to drive a large-scale expansion (their inclusion
reduces the growth rate of the instability but does not
alter its qualitative properties).

With these assumptions, the force balance is purely in

the direction of the major radius and given by [3, 4]

ρm

4π2b2R2 (L + µ0R/2) −
where ρm is the mass density of the ring and I is the
total ring current. The inductance of the ring is given by
L = µ0R (ln(8R/b) − 2 + li/2). The internal inductance
per unit length of the ring li is of order unity if the radial
proﬁle of the current density is not strongly peaked in
the center of the torus; in particular for uniform current
density, li = 1/2. The ﬂux enclosed by the ring is Ψ =
ΨI + Ψex, with ΨI = LI. Ideal MHD requires Ψ = const
during a perturbation R → R + dR. We now have to
make an assumption how Ψex evolves. Here we follow
Bateman, who ignored changes in the external ﬁeld due
to the perturbation and evaluated the enclosed external
ﬂux using the prescribed external ﬁeld Bex(R),

Ψ = ΨI + Ψex = LI − 2π

Bex(r)rdr .

(3)

This consistency with the use of Bex(R) in the expression
for the restoring force in Eq. (2) implies inconsistency re-
garding the conservation of the enclosed ﬂux. If the latter

Z

were to be treated consistently, one would have to re-
quire Ψex(R) = const instead. Numerical simulations of
the instability, which will be reported elsewhere, support
the instability criterion derived from Eq. (3). They also
show that magnetic reconnection sets in at the rear side
of the expanding ring as the instability develops and lets
the ring eﬀectively “slide” through the external poloidal
ﬁeld [10], so that Eq. (3) represents a reasonable aproxi-
mation also for large expansions. With both assumptions
for Ψex(R) it is easily seen that the total ring current,
I(R) ≤ ΨI0/L(R), must decrease as a free torus expands,
since the logarithmic term in L varies only weakly with R
(subscripts 0 denote initial values here and henceforth).
We make the ansatz that Bex(R) = ˆBR−n in the region
of interest, R ≥ R0. (At R → 0 a ﬁnite Bex is assumed,
whose particular value will drop out of the equations be-
low. We also have to assume n 6= 2 in intermediate
steps of the calculation but ﬁnd that the ﬁnal expres-
sions [r.h.s. of Eq. (6) and following] match smoothly as
(n−2) → ±0.) Using Eq. (3) the ring current is expressed
through the initial values,

We now assume c(R) = const, which is exact if the ex-
pansion is self-similar and can otherwise be expected
to introduce relatively little error because c depends
only logarithmically on R/b(R). An approximately self-
similar evolution of a freely expanding ring has been
found in a laboratory experiment [1], and also the ob-
servations of CMEs indicate some degree of self similar-
ity [11]. With c(R) = c0, the condition for instability,

Bateman’s condition is recovered as c0 → ∞, which may
be regarded as the “very large aspect ratio limit.” If
Ψex(R) = Ψex 0 is assumed in Eq. (3), then the expan-
sion is described by d2ρ/dτ 2 = (c0/c)2(c + 1/2)/(c0 +
1/2)ρ−2
1 − ρ2−n(c/c0)(c0 + 1/2)/(c + 1/2)
instead of
Eq. (6), and (again with c(R) = c0) the threshold rises
to n > 2. We note that this assumption (with Ψex 0 = 0)
and this threshold correspond to the case of a gravita-
tionally balanced current ring around a star or massive
object, which should, therefore, be marginally stable.

Eq. (6) can be integrated twice only for small displace-

bation. Integrating Eq. (6) once shows that for n > 3/2
a constant asymptotic velocity is reached

For ncr < n < 3/2 the acceleration does not decrease suf-
ﬁciently rapidly as ρ → ∞ so that the asymptotic velocity
diverges. This discrepancy with the behavior at n > 3/2
results from the simpliﬁcations made; it would disappear
if the restoring forces due to ﬂux and pressure pileup in
front of the expanding ring, which dominate at large ρ,
would be included. The asymptotic gain of kinetic energy
R0 (d2R/dt2)dR ≈ M (R0/T )2, n > 3/2,
is ∆W = M
where M = 2π2b2
R
For large aspect ratio,

the characteristic velocity
in these expressions is much larger than the hybrid
Alfv´en velocity of the initial conﬁguration, R0/T ≈
(R0/b0)VAi ≫ VAi (with li ∼ 1/2 we have (c0 +
1/2)1/2/2 ≈ 1). Therefore, v0T /R0 ≪ 1 even in
the case that the initial perturbation v0 approaches
VAi, as may happen if it is due to a kink instability
[10, 12]. The dimensional asymptotic expansion veloc-
ity, ≈ 21/2(R0/b0)VAi for n > 3/2, scales as the Alfv´en
velocity of the initial conﬁguration.

0R0ρm0 is the mass of the torus.

Figure 1 shows the acceleration proﬁle, a = d2ρ/dτ 2,
and the numerical solution of Eq. (6) with c(R) = c0,
along with the analytical approximations Eqs. (8) and
(9), for particular values of v0T /R0 and R0/b0 and for
the practically relevant range of n. The acceleration rises
quickly to a maximum, which increases strongly with
n > ncr and is reached within ρ <
∼ 2 for all n shown.
It then decreases quickly with increasing ρ for n >
∼ 2 but
decreases only slowly for n close to ncr. The resulting
expansion, ρ(τ ) − 1, has an approximately exponential-
to-linear characteristic for n >
∼ 2, but is much closer

to a constant-acceleration curve over a considerable ra-
dial range for n close to ncr. A qualitatively similar
n dependence of the acceleration proﬁle is obtained if
Ψex(R) = Ψex 0 is assumed in Eq. (3).

This n dependence of the expansion ﬁts perfectly to the
typical characteristics of CME rise proﬁles. Fast CMEs
reach a speed of ∼ 103 km s−1, comparable to the Alfv´en
velocity in the inner corona, often within a height range
of h <
∼ R⊙/3 above the photosphere and show no sig-
niﬁcant acceleration further out. These events originate
from active regions which possess a rapid decay of the
ﬁeld concentration at heights comparable to the sunspot
distance D (D ∼ R⊙/10 in bigger active regions); for
essentially bipolar active regions, n > 3/2 for h > D/2,
quickly approaching n ≈ 3 at h >
∼ D. On the other hand,
slow CMEs propagate with roughly constant, small accel-
eration throughout the currently observable height range
(h <
∼ 30 R⊙), reaching the gravitational escape speed
of a few 102 km s−1 typically only at heights of several
R⊙. These events originate from erupting prominences

3

far from active regions, where the large-scale height de-
pendence of the ﬁeld, approximately B ∝ h−3/2 [13],
dominates already low in the corona. Interestingly, the
fastest CMEs, and the strongest ﬂares, originate in so-
called δ-spot regions, which are quadrupolar, with one
pair of opposite polarity being closely packed within a
single sunspot, so that a particularly steep ﬁeld decrease
(n > 3) occurs low in the corona within very strong
ﬁelds, which imply high Alfv´en velocities of up to several
103 km s−1. Thus, the torus instability not only provides
a uniform description of the apparently disparate classes
of fast and slow CMEs [14] but explains naturally also the
preferred occurrence of the most powerful solar eruptions
in δ-spot regions [15].

The magnetic ﬁeld in erupting prominences and CME
cores can be modeled as a section of a torus, whose re-
maining part is submerged and frozen in the dense, high-
beta photospheric and subphotospheric plasma. Such
line-tying is generally regarded to have a stabilizing in-
ﬂuence; for example, in case of the helical kink instability
it raises the threshold twist from 2π to 2.49π [16]. It has
an even stronger eﬀect on the TI. If a current-carrying
loop emerges or is formed in the low corona, the line-
tying is expected to suppress the instability completely
until the loop is at least semicircular, since the major ra-
dius of a rising loop must decrease before that stage [17].
Beyond that point, however, the line-tying introduces a
strong support of the expansion because it enforces the
current through the footpoints of the partial ring to be
constant. It is not clear at present how much of this cur-
rent can enter the coronal part of the ring, where, due
to the low resistivity, reconnection cannot easily occur so
that the number of ﬁeld line turns within the ring and
hence IR tend to be constant. While a complete account
of the line-tying requires a more sophisticated treatment,
we can describe its amplifying eﬀect on the expansion by
replacing Eq. (4) with I(R) = I0, obtaining the limiting
case of maximum outward acceleration, given by

The critical decay index of the external poloidal ﬁeld for
instability,

ncr = 3/2 − 1/(2c0 + 1) ,

(11)

is only slightly smaller than the critical index for the
freely expanding ring. The initial evolution is again given
by Eq. (8). The strong amplifying eﬀect becomes appar-
ent in the further evolution. This shows an enlarged ra-
dial range of acceleration, in better agreement with CME
observations, and a higher peak (Fig. 2). The asymptotic
acceleration does not vanish, however. Since a(ρ → ∞)
is small only for ln(8R0/b0) ≫ 1 or for li0 ≫ 1, which

Another consequence of constant ring current is the
decrease of the aspect ratio in the course of the instability.

(Fig. 3). Such overexpansion of the minor radius is a
characteristic of many CMEs, observed as a cavity in the
outer part of the rising ﬂux, which gives rise to the so-
called three-part structure of CMEs [8]. The overexpan-
sion is so rapid that b → R for ρ = R/R0 ∼ 101–102. At
this point our simpliﬁed description breaks down. We can
expect that magnetic reconnection with the surrounding
ﬁeld or between the loop legs is then triggered. This
implies that I(R) = const no longer holds and that the
acceleration falls oﬀ as the reconnection proceeds. Com-
paring the acceleration proﬁles in Figs. 1 and 2, it is clear
that the association of fast and slow CMEs with, respec-
tively, high and only slightly supercritical decay index n
holds for line-tied current rings as well.

Let us ﬁnally consider the expansion of a spheromak-
like torus in a nearly ﬁeld-free vacuum chamber [1], which
proceeded in the observed range, ρ <
∼ 2, with roughly
constant velocity. We note that Taylor relaxation in the
torus transformed toroidal into poloidal ﬂux in the course
of the expansion, inﬂuencing the TI in as yet unknown
ways, and that the scatter in the data (Fig. 19 in [1])
permits a ﬁt with slightly increasing velocity as well.
With Bex = 0 and Ψ(R) = L0I0 we obtain d2ρ/dτ 2 =
(c+1/2)c−2ρ−2 in place of Eq. (6), where time is now nor-
malized to T ′ = (π/c0)(b0/ ˜VAi) and ˜VAi is deﬁned using
the ﬁeld in the center of the ring ( ˜B) and ρm0. This accel-
eration decreases so rapidly that, soon after onset, the ex-
pansion velocity is expected to increase only slowly with
ρ, consistent with the observation. The asymptotic ve-
R0/T ′ ∼ 5–16 km s−1, obtained
locity,
using the observed R/b ≈ 2, ˜B ∼ 300 G as a represen-
tative value of the measured range (Figs. 11, 12b,c in

(cid:0)

[1]), and estimated densities N ∼ 1015–1016 cm−3 (Bel-
lan, personal communication), is in acceptable agreement
with the observed expansion velocity of ≈ 5 km s−1.

We conclude that the TI is a possible mechanism for
CMEs (in addition to a catastrophe [2, 9] and to the
helical kink instability [10]), that the TI governs their
medium-scale (ρ <
∼ 102) expansion, providing a uniﬁed
description of fast and slow CMEs and a possible ex-
planation for their three-part structure, and that the TI
occurred in experiments on spheromak expansion.

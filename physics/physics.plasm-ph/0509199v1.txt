Abstract

The line of phase equilibrium between the hot and cold phases of a plasma is derived from

the intensity of thermal radiation as a function of the plasma density and temperature. The last

function is obtained with the help of the condition for emission relating the wavelength of radiation

and the plasma density.

It was shown recently [1] that a transport barrier in toroidal plasma, i.e. the region of

reduced energy transport across magnetic surfaces [2-4], is the boundary region between the

hot and cold phases of the plasma. The transport properties of the hot phase essentially

diﬀer from those of the cold phase due to the intense interaction of the plasma with thermal

radiation above the inversion temperature [5]. The boundary region between the hot and cold

phases corresponds to the minimum values of speciﬁc resistivity and transport coeﬃcients

of the plasma. Other speciﬁc properties of a transport barrier such as low magnetic shear,

the generation of radial electric ﬁelds, and the poloidal rotation are the consequences of the

minimum resistivity and transport coeﬃcients of a plasma in this region.

The speciﬁc resistivity of the cold phase in the vicinity of the phase transition to the hot

phase is very small, so the phase transition is nearly superconductive. The additional current

ﬂows in the cold phase nearby the boundary with the hot phase and does not heat the hot

phase, so the additional neutral-beam or radio-frequency heating is required to obtain higher

temperatures in the hot phase [3,4].

The critical value Te,c of the electron temperature, corresponding to the transition from

the cold to the hot phase, for relatively low plasma densities achievable in tokamaks is

independent of the density and has an order of magnitude of the inversion temperature

∼
= 2keV [5]. Studies of sawtooth oscillations by von Goeler, Stodiek, and Southoﬀ [6]

T0

suggest that the transition temperature is approximately Te,c

∼
= 0.8keV . In this paper, we

expand the line of phase equilibrium between the hot and cold phases of a plasma in the

region of higher densities where the dependence of the transition temperature on the plasma

density is essential.

obtained [7] in the form

Earlier, the energy distribution of atoms in the ﬁeld of thermal blackbody radiation was

where N0 is the population of the ground state E0, N is the population of the energy level

in [7].

The function (1) has a maximum at ~ωm = 1.6kT . When the temperature exceeds the
critical value of T0 = 2 × 107K (the inversion temperature), the population of the energy

level E exceeds the population of the ground state E0. Since the function (1) is increasing

in the range ω < ωm , the inversion of the energy level population is produced also in

some vicinity of ωm (below ωm). This suggests the maser ampliﬁcation of thermal radio

emission in continuum by a hot plasma with the temperature exceeding the critical value

T0. Maser ampliﬁcation in compact radio sources was assumed earlier in [8] based on the

high brightness temperatures of active galactic nuclei. Since a hot plasma in an accretion

disk is concentrated nearby the central energy source, maser ampliﬁcation is characteristic

for compact radio sources.

It is clear that, when the temperature of a plasma is below T0, the radio ﬂux is very small,

and when the temperature exceeds T0, radio emission is on. This an on-oﬀ cycle is detected

in the radio pulsar PSR B1259-63 [9]. Similar is an on-oﬀ cycle in X-ray pulsars, e.g., the

35-day cycle in Her X-1. It implies that X-ray emission from X-ray pulsars is produced by

the laser ampliﬁcation in continuum which is quite analogues to maser ampliﬁcation at radio

wavelengths.

It was shown also [7] that thermal emission has a stimulated character. According to this

conception thermal emission from non-uniform gas is produced by an ensemble of individual

emitters. Each of these emitters is an elementary resonator the size of which has an order

of magnitude of mean free path l of photons

where n is the number density of particles and σ is the absorption cross-section.

The emission of each elementary resonator is coherent, with the wavelength

(2)

(3)

and thermal emission of gaseous layer is incoherent sum of radiation produced by individual

emitters.

An elementary resonator emits in the direction opposite to the direction of the density

gradient. The wall of the resonator corresponding to the lower density is half-transparent

due to the decrease of absorption with the decreasing gas density.

λ = l,

The condition (3) implies that the radiation with the wavelength λ is produced by the

gaseous layer with the deﬁnite number density of particles n .

The condition (3) is consistent with the experimental results by Looney and Brown on

the excitation of plasma waves by electron beam [10].

The intensity of thermal blackbody radiation is given by the Planck formula

Bν (T ) = 2hν3/c2 (exp (hν/T ) − 1)

−1

,

(4)

where ν = c/λ is the frequency of radiation, c is the speed of light, h is the Planck constant,

T is the temperature, the Boltzmann constant being assumed to be included in the deﬁnition

of the temperature. Using the condition for emission (3), we obtain the intensity of thermal

blackbody radiation as a function of the density, n, and the temperature, T, in the form

B (n, T ) = (cid:0)2T 3/h2c2

where α = 1

4hcσa, andσa is the absorption cross-section.

Since the function f (x) = x3/ (ex − 1) has a maximum at xm ≈ 3, the value of the

density, nc, corresponding to the maximum value of the intensity of thermal radiation, is

given by the formula

nc ≈ 3T /α = 12T / (hcσa) .

(6)

A hot plasma with the temperature Te > T0

∼
= 2keV is intensely interacting with the ﬁeld

of thermal radiation. At temperatures T > T0 the stimulated radiation processes dominate

this interaction [5]. Thermal radiation induces radiative transitions in the system of electron

and ion which corresponds to the transition of electron from the free to the bounded state.

Thus, in a hot plasma interacting with thermal radiation, the bounded states of electrons

and ions restore, leading to the change of collision properties of a hot plasma. In this case,

the electron-ion collision cross-section has an order of magnitude of the atomic cross-section,

∼
= 10−15cm2.

σ0

In the Wien region n > nc (T ) the intensity of thermal radiation exponentially decreases

with the increase of the density, so the interaction between a plasma and thermal radiation

is weak, and hence this region corresponds to the cold phase of a plasma. The hot phase of a

plasma is realized in the Rayleigh-Jeans region n < nc (T ) (assuming that the temperature

4

exceeds the inversion temperature), where the intensity of thermal radiation comparatively

weakly depends on the plasma density.

As a result, the line of phase equilibrium between the hot and cold phases of a plasma is

described by the following approximate expressions:

Consider now the phase equilibrium between the hot and cold phases of a plasma. The

pressure in the cold phase is given by the formula

where ni = ne are the ion and electron densities respectively. The pressure in the hot phase

Pc = 2niT,

is

atoms.

Ph = n0T + 2 (nh − n0) T,

(10)

where n0 is the density of neutral atoms, and nh is the total density of ions and neutral

If n0 ≈ nh, then from the condition of equilibrium, Pc = Ph, we ﬁnd that nh ≈ nc, i.e. the

density of the hot phase is approximately twice of the density of the cold phase. It means

that there is the discontinuity of density at the boundary between the hot and cold phases,

analogous to the ﬁrst order phase transitions.

There is also the discontinuity of resistivity somewhat analogous to the superconduction

phase transitions. The speciﬁc resistivity of the hot phase, ηh, is about three orders of

magnitude larger than that of the cold phase, ηc. As much as large is the discontinuity of

thermal conductivity across magnetic surfaces, so the cold phase is a good thermal protector

for the hot phase.

The discontinuity of diﬀusion coeﬃcients with respect to the diﬀusion across magnetic

surfaces leads to the generation of radial electric ﬁelds in the region of a transport barrier

5

due to the diﬀerences in diﬀusion coeﬃcients for ions and electrons . The drift of electrons

and ions in these electric ﬁelds produces the poloidal rotation of the plasma.

To summerise, the critical temperature of the phase transition between the cold and

hot phases of a plasma is independent of the plasma density for low densities and increases

proportionally to the plasma density for higher densities exceeding some critical value. There

are discontinuities of density, resistivity, and transport coeﬃcients at the point of phase

transition. The high-temperature phase transition in a plasma is experimentally observed

as a transport barrier in toroidal plasma.

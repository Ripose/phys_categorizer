The expansion dynamics of a ﬁnite size plasma is examined from an analytical perspective. Results
regarding the charge distribution as well as the electrostatic potential are presented. The acceleration
of the ions and the associated cooling of the electrons that takes place during the plasma expansion
is described. An extensive analysis of the transition between the semi inﬁnite and the ﬁnite size
plasma behaviour is carried out. Finally, a test of the analytical results, performed through numerical
simulations, is presented.

The production of energetic particles through the in-
teraction of an intense laser pulse with a solid target is
a topic that has been widely investigated during the last
three decades. For suﬃciently long pulses, the emitted
particles emerge from a coronal plasma formed by the
laser on the target foil and the expansion of the plasma
in vacuum plays a key role in such a phenomenon. Thus,
despite in Refs.[1, 2, 3, 4] the expansion of a semi inﬁnite
plasma has been widely investigated, present experiments
often involve “thin foils” as targets [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
which are in some cases no thicker than a few tens of
a Debye length, and we believe that, in these cases, the
experimental results must be analyzed in terms of the
expansion of a ﬁnite size plasma. The ﬁnite-size and the
semi-inﬁnite cases are very diﬀerent from each other, as in
the latter case an inﬁnite amount of energy is available.
As a consequence, even if the ions are accelerated, the
energy of the electron plasma remains constant. On the
contrary, in the case of a ﬁnite size plasma an exchange
of kinetic energy between electrons and ions takes place
as long as the two populations have diﬀerent velocity dis-
tributions, i.e., as long as a charge separation is present.
The aim of this work is to provide a detailed analytical
description of the thermal expansion of a globally neutral,
ﬁnite size, unidimensional plasma. Analytical predictions
will be compared with numerical results obtained with a
Particle in Cell (PIC) code.
The conﬁguration at the initial time t0, which formally
can be deﬁned as the hydrostatic equilibrium in the limit
of inﬁnitely massive ions, is speciﬁed by the ion den-

notational simplicity we are considering a plasma where
the ion charge is equal and opposite of that of the elec-
trons. Measuring space in units of the initial electron
Debye length λd,0 = (Te0/4πe2n0)1/2 and rescaling the
φ(x, t) = eΦ(x, t)/Te0, we

continuity of E(ζ) across the boundary ζ = a and us-
ing Eq.(1), we obtain the following relationship for the
potential and the electron density at ζ = 0 φ(0) =
(na/n0)eφ(0) = ne0(0)/n0. The integration in Eq.(3) for

to an intermediate value between its two values, na and

We now derive a physical model capable of describing
the electron cooling that occurs as the plasma expansion
takes place and, consequently, ion acceleration. Measur-
ing temperatures in units of T0, where T0 = Te0, mass in
units of the ion mass mi, and introducing the dimension-
less time unit τ = ωpit, with ωpi = √4πn0e2, we denote
with Te the electron time dependent temperature, with
me the electron mass and assume that both the initial
ﬂuid and thermal ion energy is zero. The quantity Te
can in principle depend both on x and τ , however in
what follows it will be assumed spatially constant.
In
order to derive an analytical expression for the cooling
of the electron population we need to introduce a sim-
pliﬁed description of the ion expansion and of the time
evolution of the electric ﬁeld. For this purpose, we in-
troduce the approximate ion proﬁle ni(x, τ ) sketched in
Fig.(2) which is speciﬁed once the quantities xs and xf
are known. The point xs models the position of the rar-

We may summarize the results of the above modeling
of the plasma expansion in vacuum by referring to a,
τ /(a√me) and τ /√a as the relevant physical quanti-
ties characterizing the plasma dynamics. The condition
1 implies that, at every time τ , the electron den-
a
sity at the expanding front is nf = Dn0/e, as in the
hydrodynamic equilibrium of a semi-inﬁnite slab. The
quantity τ /(a√me), where a√me is the typical time it
takes an electron to cross the target, roughly gives the
ratio of particles which, at time τ , have undergone at
least one reﬂection at the ion front. Thus the initial
expansion phase when τ /(a√me)
1 corresponds to
the semi-inﬁnite, constant temperature plasma limit dis-
cussed in [1, 2, 3]. The quantity τ /√a measures, at the
early stage of the process, the expansion of the ion com-
ponent in the plasma.

front and neglecting coeﬃcients of order unity, we obtain
τ 2/a where V is the volume oc-
(xf −
cupied by the ions. In the initial expansion phase, from
2 dV /V ,
Eq.(9) we obtain dTe/Te ≈ −
which implies that in this phase the plasma behaves like
a perfect monoatomic gas obeying the law of unidimen-
sional adiabatic expansion. Thus, the plane (a, τ ) can
be divided into four regions by the two curves τ = √a
and τ = a√me, as shown in Fig.(3). The two curves
cross at a = 1/me. In the three regions A, B, D deﬁned
by τ < max(a√me, √a), electron cooling is not impor-
tant and the slab expansion can be approximated by the
semi inﬁnite case. In region C the eﬀects of the the ﬁnite
size of the plasma becomes apparent and ion acceleration
takes place together with electron cooling.
Now we reexamine the approximations used in the deriva-
tion of Eq.(9). The assumption of uniform temperature
rests on the comparison between the energy redistribu-
tion time, approximated by a√me, and the typical ion
plasma expansion time √a, which roughly represents the
energy conﬁnement time. Therefore the temperature in-

tron reﬂection time to be of order √me. The validity of
this condition has been veriﬁed by integrating Eqs.(7, 8,
9) numerically. Finally, because of the signiﬁcant spread
of the ion front, the eﬀective value of Ef is smaller than
the one obtained within this model. This may be cor-
D)α,
rected by introducing the reduction factor 1
with α a constant to be ﬁxed numerically. In order to
determinate the value of α and to verify our analytical
results, a series of numerical simulations has been per-
formed using a unidimensional PIC code. The numerical
results that we present here describe the expansion of a
plasma slab 50 λd thick with initial conditions given by
Eqs.(1,6). An overall good agreement between the ana-
lytical and the numerical results is achieved with α = 1.4.
The ion total kinetic energy and the value of Ef and
the position of the ion front are plotted versus time in
Figs.(4) and (5), respectively. Diﬀerent simulations for
slabs up to 150λd thick have been performed and have
conﬁrmed the validity of the analytical model and in par-
ticular of the choice of the value of the parameter α. The
comparison between the ﬁnite size results and those de-
scribed in [1] is shown in Fig.(5) and indicates that the
semi-inﬁnite and the ﬁnite size plasma behaviours are
very similar only at the early stage of the expansion pro-
cess, while they become, as expected, substantially dif-
ferent when the electron kinetic energy is signiﬁcantly
reduced.
In conclusion our analytical model shows that, in the case
of a ﬁnite size plasma, the process of electron cooling
leads to a nearly complete energy transfer from electrons
to ions on time intervals of the order of a few tens of the
transit time a√me. This sets an upper limit to the en-
ergy ions can acquire in the thermal expansion of a ﬁnite
size plasma. Furthermore, diﬀerent expansion regimes
as function of time and plasma size have been identiﬁed
and the numerical veriﬁcation of the proposed model has
been discussed.

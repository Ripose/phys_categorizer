Abstract

Studies of charge-charge (ion-ion, ion-electron, and electron-electron) coupling properties for ion

impurities in an electron gas and for a two component plasma are carried out on the basis of a

regularized electron-ion potential without short-range Coulomb divergence. This work is moti-

vated in part by questions arising from recent spectroscopic measurements revealing discrepancies

with present theoretical descriptions. Many of the current radiative property models for plasmas

include only single electron-emitter collisions and neglect some or all charge-charge interactions.

A molecular dynamics simulation of dipole relaxation is proposed here to allow proper account

of many electron-emitter interactions and all charge-charge couplings. As illustrations, molecular

dynamics simulations are reported for the cases of a single ion imbedded in an electron plasma

and for a two-component ion-electron plasma. Ion-ion, electron-ion, and electron-electron coupling

eﬀects are discussed for hydrogen-like Balmer alpha lines.

INTRODUCTION

Theories for the interpretation of spectroscopic measurements in hot plasmas are crucial

for diagnosing and studying laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Well known theories such

as the impact theory [1] or the uniﬁed theory [2] for electron broadening will be mentioned

below. It should be emphasized that in this context a “theory” is a closed ensemble of many

theoretical developments built on the basis of an initial set of hypotheses, namely a “model”

(possibly including a few variants). Within each theory, speciﬁc analytical and numerical

methods are assumed for practical calculation of the physical properties that belong to

that theory. The analysis here addresses the validity of common assumptions regarding

the many-body Coulomb forces for computing radiative properties. More speciﬁcally, the

lineshapes of ion emitters in fully ionized plasmas are investigated using classical molecular

dynamics (MD) simulation. The advantage of MD simulation lies in its ability to account

for all charge-charge interactions without approximation, providing a means to assess their

relative importance for lineshape calculations.

Most of the current models for the study of radiative properties of an emitter in a dilute

medium treat the internal states of the emitter quantum mechanically, but use a semi-

classical description for their interaction with the environment for the description of the

environment. The system considered here is the same: a quantum emitter of charge Ze

imbedded in an equilibrium classical plasma with ions of charge Zie and electrons of charge

−e at equilibrium. For simplicity, in all of the following it is assumed that the emitter

couples to the plasma only through its monopole and dipole interactions.

The line shape is then determined by the Stark broadening of the total electric ﬁeld at the

emitter. Three timescales have to be considered together: those characterizing ion motion,

τi, electron motion, τe and a typical emitter dipole relaxation time, τd. In all cases τi is

much larger than τe due to their large mass ratio. Consequently, the ions do not respond

directly to individual electron motions but rather to their averaged collective dynamics whose

primary eﬀect is to screen the ion-ion interactions. Conversely, the free electrons are coupled

to all other electrons, and a slowly varying ion and emitter charge distribution through

unscreened potentials. Similarly, the optical electrons bound to the emitter and responsible

for radiation emission are coupled to the classical charges through a slowly varying screened

ion ﬁeld, and rapidly varying electric ﬁelds due to the colliding electrons via the dipole

2

interaction. In some current theories the eﬀects of this complex plasma environment are

represented through the hypothesis of atomic or ionic emitters interacting with ions through

a Coulomb ﬁeld screened at the electronic Debye length and by free electrons moving on

straight trajectories (no electron-emitter or electron-electron interactions) - hereafter called

independent-electrons. The simplest formulation of the impact theory for electron broadening

is developed on this basis with three additional constraints for the independent electrons: 1)

non-overlapping strong collisions (binary collision approximation), 2) positive lower bound

for the impact parameter range (strong collision cut-oﬀ), and 3) a Debye screened Coulomb

interaction between free and bound emitter electrons. In such theories, collective eﬀects or

correlations among the various charges are accounted for only in the static Debye screened

ion-emitter and electron-emitter ﬁelds. The objective of our presentation here is to explore

in a controlled fashion the eﬀects of correlations, both static and dynamic, on properties

relevant to plasma spectroscopy.

Lineshape calculations follow two distinct stages: ﬁrst, the “stochastic” properties of

the local electric ﬁeld perturbation at the charged emitter from a classical plasma model

are determined, and next these properties are used for modeling the dipole emission. The

ﬁrst point refers to a determination of charge structure and dynamics, and is essentially a

nonlinear problem depending on the emitter monopole charge and the plasma parameters -

a plasma physics problem. The second is connected to the behavior of a quantum emitter

in a given time dependant stochastic perturbation - an atomic physics problem. The utility

of MD simulation to treat the plasma physics component “without approximation” is well-

known [3], although the application to study correlation eﬀects of electrons with higher Z

ions is a new direction for hot plasmas [4]. However, in order to assess the importance of such

eﬀects for spectroscopy, the atomic physics component is essential. The results presented

here are a ﬁrst attempt to combine MD simulation and atomic physics for a controlled

description of both electron and ion broadening [5]. Earlier applications of MD to spectral

line broadening were limited to simulating the plasma ion ﬁelds [6]. Here, we emphasize

the more diﬃcult task of simulating as well the electrons which couple to the emitter in a

qualitatively diﬀerent way due to their attractive interaction.

The classical plasmas considered for simulation are systems of point charges, either point

electrons and the emitter monopole in a uniform positive background - hereafter called

inhomogeneous jellium - or a two component plasma (TCP) of electrons plus the emitter

3

monopoles. It is assumed that quantum mechanical eﬀects are either negligible (as for the

heavy ions and emitter) or can be incorporated through appropriate modiﬁcations of the

classical Coulomb potential for the electrons. The latter is achieved by using a regularized

Coulomb potential which remains ﬁnite at short distances, accounting simply for the true

quantum diﬀraction eﬀects [7]. This allows derivation of all the desired theoretical properties

using the laws of classical mechanics, as well as the application of MD. A detailed study

of the time independent statistical properties of an electron gas with an ion impurity has

been carried out recently on the basis of such a regularized electron-ion potential [4]. Two

standard classical methods have been used for this study: molecular dynamics (MD) for

numerical simulation for both dynamical and structural properties, and the hypernetted

chain approximation (HNC) for the theoretical prediction of structural properties. This

enables both cross comparisons and interpretations of results. An interpretation of the

dynamical properties of the electron ﬁeld autocorrelation function (FCF) at the impurity

also has been carried out [8] and is considered further here.

Molecular dynamics is a unique way for providing realistic representations of the stochas-

tic electric ﬁelds determining the dipole interaction of the emitter with its environment.

Describing these ﬁelds by simulation allows one to obtain lineshapes accounting for all the

correlations between charged particles. Such lineshapes would provide essential reference

data to benchmark more eﬃcient but phenomenological theoretical models developed for

plasma diagnostics. Several recent theories for line broadening have been developed for in-

vestigations at new plasma conditions, including the hot and dense matter conditions needed

for the presence of highly charged emitters. They suggest that part of the discrepancies found

with experiments is an inadequate description of the emitter and electron perturber coupling

mechanisms. The present study provides new information for this discussion.

The types of questions posed are the following: 1) What is the validity of straight line

trajectories for the electrons in the presence of a charged emitter (neglect of electron-emitter,

electron-electron, and electron-ion coupling in the dynamics)? 2) How well are the missing

correlations of 1) captured by simple screening of the electron emitter interaction? 3) What

is the importance of multi-electron strong collisions? This study addresses these issues for

two diﬀerent classical plasma environments of the emitter. Both are well distinct from those

resulting from independent electron models assumed for impact theories. The ﬁrst and

simplest is the inhomogeneous jellium used for describing electron broadening only. The

4

corresponding study is hereafter referred to as the electron broadening theory (EBT). The

second is a more realistic two component electron-ion plasma leading to a both ion and

electron broadening theory (IEBT). The parameter range explored in this work is chosen

to be compatible with hot and dense plasma diagnostics based on spectroscopy. These are

conditions similar to those for which there are long standing discrepancies between theory

and experiment. For a recent discussion and earlier references see reference [9].

In section II the main points of the classical plasma study for the positive charge emitter

in the above two plasma environments is described. Section III outlines the dipole relaxation

stage of the broadening theories reported in this paper. Then, the main results obtained with

the EBT, i.e. the eﬀects of ion-electron correlations on electron broadening of spectral lines,

are reported and discussed. Also in Section III dipole relaxation in a TCP is considered and

some preliminary results obtained using the the IEBT are shown. The examples reported

below involve the Balmer alpha line for various hydrogen-like emitters of charge 1, 3, 5 and

8 and various temperatures.

II. PLASMA ENVIRONMENT MODELING

This section provides an illustration of the results that can be obtained from MD sim-

ulation for the two types of plasma environments considered for the emitter. In both the

inhomogeneous jellium and the two component electron-ion plasma (TCP), the monopole

of the emitter is included as a point charge. The dipole operator representing the internal

states of the emitter is not considered in this section. For the density and temperature

conditions considered the repulsive interactions of same sign charges eﬀectively excludes

pair conﬁgurations of the order of the DeBroglie wavelength and quantum eﬀects are small.

Consequently, the ion-ion, ion-emitter, and electron-electron interactions are taken to be

Coulomb

V12(r) = Z1Z2e−r/λ/r

(1)

where Z1Z2 is positive. For practical purposes these Coulomb interactions have been

screened at a distance λ = s/2 which is taken to be of the order of the system size s. This

allows application of the usual periodic boundary conditions in the MD simulation. Since

interactions among the charges introduce a physical screening at much shorter distances,

this system size screening does not aﬀect any of the properties being considered here. In

5

contrast, electron-ion and electron-emitter interactions are attractive and the conﬁgurations

within a DeBroglie wavelength become relevant. At such distances the Coulomb interaction

must be modiﬁed within a classical description to account for quantum diﬀraction eﬀects.

There are many ways such quantum potentials can be constructed and here we use one of

the simplest forms [7]

Vie(r) = −Ze2(1 − e−r/δ)e−r/λ/r

(2)

where δ = (2π~2/mekBTe)1/2 is the thermal De Broglie wavelength. This ion-electron poten-

tial regularization provides a well deﬁned classical physics for opposite sign charge systems,

and the various sophisticated classical N-body methods of classical statistical mechanics

can be applied. The consequences and advantages of such a semi-classical approach for the

radiative properties of ion emitters will be discussed in the last sections.

Other parameters of interest are the average electron-electron distance r0 = (3/4πNe)1/3
deﬁned in terms of the electron density Ne, the electron thermal velocity v0 = (2kBTe/me)1/2,
the mean electronic ﬁeld E0 = e/r2
0, the electron-electron coupling constant Γ = e2/r0kBTe,
and the electron plasma frequency ωp = (4πNee2/me)1/2. The coupling between the electrons

and the impurity is measured by the ion-electron potential at the origin which, in units of

r0, becomes σ = ZΓ/δ. Similar quantities are deﬁned for the ions in the TCP by replacing

the magnitude of the electron charge and density by the corresponding ion values.

Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out using a number N of electrons for the

jellium, or N electrons and N/Zi ions for the TCP. In the ﬁrst case a point charge Z ≪ N

representing the emitter is included while for the TCP the ions are considered as the emitters

for simplicity. The simulation is done using periodic boundary conditions on an elementary

cubic cell of size c large enough to ensure λ > λD, where λD is the Debye wavelength, and

λ ≤ s/2. These conditions assure that the physical screening due to the charge interactions

occur at a shorter scale than the system size screening, as noted above. Because N must

be large to agree with the condition Z ≪ N the impurity-impurity correlation inherent to

periodic boundary conditions is negligible. Moreover as we are only interested in the charge

structure and dynamics in the ion vicinity the usual Ewald’s sum is not required. Particle

motion in MD simulation is achieved using a Verlet algorithm with a time step error of order

(∆t)4: rn+1 = 2rn − rn−1 + an(∆t)2.

A.

Ion emitter in an electron gas

This section summarizes the study of a single ion impurity (the monopole of the emitter)

imbedded in an electron gas. A uniform positive background maintains overall charge neu-

trality but has no eﬀect on particle motion since, according to periodic boundary conditions

used in molecular dynamics, the charges move across an inﬁnite system. The motivations

for doing the impurity case are: 1) it is a well deﬁned and simpler problem than the TCP

case in comparison, and 2) all the existing theories for electron broadening to compare with

are based on an impurity approach. The main statistical properties of the electron structure

close to the ion (e.g., electron density, electric ﬁeld probability distribution) are derived

using both MD simulation and the classical hypernetted chain (HNC) integral equations for

the impurity-electron correlation function.

Ion-electron and electron-electron coupling aﬀect both the static and dynamic properties

of the electrons near the impurity ion. The former determines the dominant Z dependence of

these properties, while the latter controls the screening and other quantitative eﬀects. The

electron density, electric microﬁeld distribution, and electric ﬁeld autocorrelation function

have been studied for various temperatures, densities, and impurity charge number Z.

Consider ﬁrst the electron density near the impurity. The simplest prediction is given

by the Debye-Huckel approximation leading to an enhanced density near the ion and Debye

screening at large distances. This approximation is expected to fail for increased electron-ion

coupling (larger values of Z) and/or increased electron-electron coupling. In that case an

adequate theory is provided by the two component HNC equations [10] specialized for the

single impurity case, i.e. for a vanishing ion density. The impurity-electron pair distribution

function gie(r) is obtained by numerical solution to these equations as a function of the direct

electron-electron correlation function cee(r) calculated separately. Aside from normalization,

this pair correlation function is the average electron number density, ne (r) = negie(r) at a

distance r from the ion. Both MD simulation and the HNC approximation are restricted

to a limited range of values for the impurity charge, density, and temperature. Outside of

this range frequent electron trapping and non-convergent iterative solution methods for the

HNC equations occur invalidating the results. Within the parameter space considered here

MD and HNC results are in good agreement as illustrated in Fig. 1. The enhanced electron

accretion around the ion impurity is due to the attractive impurity-electron interaction.

If this coupling is neglected the electron distribution becomes uniform regardless of the

electron-electron coupling. Clearly, the independent electron model is a bad approximation

for the electron density except for Z = 0. Also shown in Fig. 1 is the result obtained

by including the impurity-electron interaction but neglecting electron-electron interactions.

This misses the screening eﬀects at larger distances due to the electron coupling. For the

conditions considered, the electron coupling is small, approximately Γ = 0.116, and the

simple addition of Debye screening gives quite good results. Other properties involving the

local electron electric ﬁeld at the impurity are of primary interest for spectroscopy since

they determine the dipole coupling to the internal states of the emitter. The electric ﬁeld

for the current case is determined from the gradient of the potential in Eq. 2. For the

independent electron approximation, the screening of this ﬁeld is changed to the Debye

length. Theoretical predictions of the electric microﬁeld distribution can be obtained in

terms of gie(r) and the results using HNC have been compared with those from MD, again

with good agreement. The MD results are illustrated in Fig. 2 for two values of impurity

charge Z = 1 and Z = 8. The eﬀect of increased charge number is to decrease and broaden

the distribution. Also shown is the result for independent electrons. This is the Z = 0

interaction without electron-electron interactions, but with Debye screened ﬁelds. It is seen

to be similar to the Z = 1 results. As with the average electron density, the dominant

Z dependence is due to the impurity-electron coupling. However, at ﬁxed Z the electron-

electron coupling is responsible for important quantitative changes in the location of the

maximum and width of the distribution.

The simplest measure of the electric ﬁeld dynamics is given by the ﬁeld autocorrelation

function (FCF). Figure 3 shows the time dependence for the cases Z = 1 and Z = 8 at

Te = 200000K. Also shown is the independent-electron limit obtained for screened ﬁelds

but removing all interactions. As with the ﬁeld distribution function, the result is similar to

the Z=1 case. The ad hoc screening of the ﬁelds assures that the initial value is similar to

that with electron-electron coupling. This screening also assures that the straight trajectory

dynamics is eﬀectively restricted to a Debye sphere. However, the electron-impurity coupling

changes this agreement dramatically at larger values of Z. Qualitatively, the behavior of the

correlation function can be summarized as follows: For increasing impurity charge number

the initial value < E2 > /E2

0 increases while the correlation time decreases. Both eﬀects

are missed by the independent electron approximation, but are regained qualitatively if only

impurity-electron coupling is retained (without electron-electron interactions). However

electron-electron coupling is required for quantitative eﬀects as indicated below.

are the results for the independent electron model. The initial value of the FCF is seen

to increase at constant Z for increasing temperature. This can be understood since the

regularized potential leads to a covariance proportional to 1/δ ∼ T 1/2. The correlation time

decreases at higher temperatures, in part at least due to the increased thermal velocity.

As expected, the deviation of the independent electron model from these results increases

with increased electron coupling. The apparent agreement for the high temperature case

is misleading in this presentation, since the percent discrepancies are large over the entire

time interval as will be shown in Fig. 7 below. The eﬀect of electron-electron coupling

on the dynamics is therefore important. This is more evident for the lower temperature

comparison.

striking new feature is the anticorrelation (negative FCF) at intermediate times. This eﬀect

increases for larger Z and also for decreasing temperature, corresponding to the enhanced

electron–ion interactions. This increases the probability of electron conﬁgurations near the

ion. Many of these lead to temporary orbiting trajectories with associated large oscillatory

electric ﬁelds. When such trajectories dominate the contribution to the FCF, their changing

ﬁelds on average will lead to an anticorrelation as observed in Fig. 5. The occurrence of such

events is easily seen in the MD simulations, as shown in Fig. 6. The total ﬁeld is dominated

11

by the oscillatory ﬁelds of a few close orbits. These oscillations persist on the time scale of the

FCF, but are seen to break up on a time scale an order of magnitude longer, due to electron-

electron interactions. Thus, the eﬀect of anticorrelation is due to quasi-bound orbits, but

their correct equilibrium statistical sampling requires the electron-electron interactions to

assure the properly weighted ensemble of temporary orbiting trajectories.

A general remark can be addressed about the MD approach in the context of this dis-

cussion. The ﬁeld history sampling is started after a thermal equilibration stage intended

to reach a stationary energy state. Independent samplings are obtained starting from a new

uniform random conﬁguration of particles followed by a thermal equilibration stage. This

process is repeated many times in order to build a very large sample set. If the electron-

electron coupling is neglected, the equilibration stage does not favor the electron accretion

around the ion impurity in the correct way. As a result the sample set obtained is certainly

not the same as the sample set obtained when the electron-electron interaction is accounted

for. An improved sampling could be built using initial conﬁgurations chosen in order to

agree with the nonlinear electron distribution around a positive charge. This way has been

followed to develop a simple theoretical model for the FCF [8].

It will be seen later that the spectral line width is proportional to the time integral of

the FCF. It is diﬃcult to predict the Z dependence of this integral a priori due to the above

12

competing eﬀects of increasing initial value and decreasing correlation time. Consider again

the FCF for Z = 1 in Fig. 4 at two diﬀerent temperatures. The time integral of these

correlation functions and another at 100000K are shown as a function of temperature in

Fig. 7. Also shown are the corresponding results for the independent particle model. It is

seen that the FCF integral decreases with temperature, so evidently the dynamical eﬀect

of a decreasing correlation time dominates the increasing initial correlations. The eﬀects

of electron-impurity and electron-electron coupling leads to an approximately 15 percent

decrease in the integral at all temperatures relative to that for the independent electron

model.

Finally, the Z dependence of the FCF integral is demonstrated in Fig. 8. Again dynamical

eﬀects of a decreasing correlation time and anticorrelation dominate, leading to an approxi-

mately linear decrease of the integral with increasing Z. Consider ﬁrst the value Z = 0 (no

impurity-electron coupling). The triangle represents the results with electron-electron cou-

pling, while the line is the independent electron model. It is seen that the use of the screened

ﬁeld in the latter accounts well for the relevant electron-electron coupling. This is consistent

with the discussion following Fig. 3. Also shown is the independent electron model without

using the screened ﬁelds (open circle). This shows clearly that electron-electron coupling is

almost a 10 percent eﬀect at Z = 0. This is signiﬁcant since the electron-electron coupling

constant is quite small (Γ = 0.029). For Z = 1 the electron-emitter interaction is quite im-

portant, decreasing the integral by almost 15 percent below the independent electron value.

This coupling continues to dominate for increasing Z. As noted above, for Z > 0 there is

an additional importance of the electron-electron coupling in the MD which is needed to

establish the correct weight for the increasing number of quasi-bound orbits.

B.

Ion-electron two component plasma MD simulations

In this subsection MD studies of an equilibrium, charge neutral two-component plasmas

(TCP) of N electrons and N/Zi ions are reported. Charge neutrality is guaranteed by

the charge concentration. Preliminary classical TCP MD simulations in this context of

applications to spectroscopy have been reported elsewhere [5]. The challenging aspect of

such simulations is to move slow and fast particles at the same time. Such a study of fast

and slow processes requires simulations stable over a long period of time, long enough to

account for ion motion and based on a time step compatible with electron motion. This

problem has been addressed mostly in the context of hydrogenic plasmas [11] and is extended

14

here to higher Z ions. The emitter is taken to be one of the ions of the TCP.

It is worth noting at this point the distinction between classical MD applied to the TCP,

where both ions and electrons move dynamically, and “quantum MD” where the ions move

classically on a self-consistent potential energy surface of the electrons [12, 13]. In the latter,

at each time step for the ions the ground state conﬁguration for the electrons is determined by

some quantum method (e.g., density functional theory). Subsequently the forces between

the ions in this electronic conﬁguration are calculated and the ions are moved along the

corresponding classical trajectory. The process is repeated at the next time step. The two

classes of simulations appear complementary, with quantum MD being more appropriate for

lower temperatures and semi-classical MD more appropriate at higher temperatures.

We ﬁrst verify that the MD simulation properly describes the expected ion-electron

screening mechanism. For this purpose the simulation of a neutral mixture of hydrogen-

like carbon ions Z = 5 in electrons has been carried out with the temperature Te = 50000K
and the electron density Ne = 1019cm−3. As discussed following Eq. 1, a large cutoﬀ length

λ comparable to the system size has been used in the potential to allow the periodic bound-

ary conditions. Since the physical screening resulting from the collective eﬀects of these

“Coulomb” interactions is at a much smaller scale, this cutoﬀ does not aﬀect the study of

that screening. A comparison of the ion-ion pair distribution function for the TCP with

“Coulomb” interactions with that for a corresponding ion OCP using Debye screened inter-

action is made. In the OCP system there are no electrons and ion-ion Coulomb potential is

screened at the Debye length phenomenologically, while such screening must be generated

directly by the electrons in the TCP simulations. Figure 9 shows the rather good agreement

between the two simulations, giving an indirect evidence of the eﬀectiveness of the ion-ion

dynamic screening by the electrons (also shown is the OCP without screening to quantify

the eﬀect being studied). The TCP result shows a small enhancement of the screening

mechanism over that of the OCP at shorter distances. This behavior suggests that the short

range ion-ion interaction could be well described using an eﬀective ion charge Z < Z. An

rough estimate not shown gives Z ≃ 4.7.

Evidence of screening also can be demonstrated via the dynamics of the total ﬁeld due

to both ions and electrons at one of the ions (considered to be the emitter). MD simulation

allows determination of statistical data for each particle type involved. In the electron-ion

dynamics related to electron motion and ion motion, respectively. Both of them are of

interest for probing or discussing the simulation procedure accuracy. For the high frequency

data the electron ﬁeld autocorrelation function at the ion has been calculated. This is

similar to the property calculated in the subsection above for jellium, except that now it is

in the presence of many other ions. Figure 10 shows a comparison of the ﬁeld autocorrelation

function for the ﬁeld seen by a single ion in electrons (jellium) and for the TCP. Despite some

noise due to insuﬃcient sampling it can be observed that for the TCP the ﬁeld correlation

function does not go to 0 as for the impurity in jellium case. The timescale used in this

simulation is the inverse electron plasma frequency, compatible with the high frequency

mechanisms of the electrons. On this time scale the electron FCF tends to a constant value

rather than zero, denoting the occurrence of a low-frequency component in the electron ﬁeld,

due to its coupling to the slower ion dynamics. Contrary to the impurity ion in jellium, a

given ion is no longer a center of symmetry for the average electron structure. Rather,

this average electron structure is a blurred image of the random ion conﬁguration which

remains quasi-static at this time scale. This low frequency component disappears, as shown

on Fig. 11, if the ions are located on the nodes of a cubic array where each ion is a center

of symmetry of the inﬁnite system. As expected, on the time scale of this low-frequency

dynamics this seemingly constant value goes to 0.

the time scale of the emission or absorption process. One consequence of the occurrence of

the no screening result can be interpreted again as the proof that the screening mechanisms

take place properly in the TCP molecular dynamics simulations.

III. ELECTRON-ION COUPLING EFFECTS ON LINESHAPE

A. Dipole relaxation mechanisms

Linear response methods can be applied to the dipole relaxation of a quantum emitter in

a classical plasma environment [14]. According to the energy involved it is postulated that

the perturbation by the environment never induces transitions between the two manifolds

for which the transition is considered within the characteristic time of the emission - no

quenching approximation. This approximation therefore neglects emitter-bath coupling via

the radiated dipole transition and any contribution of the dipole transition moment at

equilibrium. As a result, the spectral proﬁles of dipole spontaneous-emission are given in

terms of the autocorrelation function C(t) of the system dipole moment q(t), via a Fourier

transformation:

The trace is taken over an equilibrium Gibbs statistical ensemble ρ for the total system of

plasma plus emitter. The Hamiltonian is taken to be the sum of the plasma Hamiltonian

(including the point monopole of the emitter) Hp, the Hamiltonian for the internal states of

the emitter He, and their interaction due to the plasma electric ﬁeld coupling to the internal

emitter dipole. For simplicity here, the Doppler broadening due to emitter center of mass

motion has been assumed to be statistically independent of this dipole broadening. The
operator q(t) = U(t)qU ∗(t) obeys the Heisemberg equation

The second term in the commutator describes the perturbation due to the total electric ﬁeld

of the plasma E(t). Due to the no quenching approximation, d is restricted here to the part

of the internal emitter dipole operator coupled to this ﬁeld. The time dependence of E(t)

is generated by the plasma Hamiltonian alone. This shows most directly the utility of MD

simulation in addressing the most diﬃcult part of a line broadening problem:

identifying

properly and completely the environment of the emitter. In the present case this is given

by an electric ﬁeld history. To represent an equilibrium ensemble for the environment a

collection of ﬁeld histories for diﬀerent initial conditions is given, the Schr¨odinger equation

solved in each case, and a simple algebraic average is performed over all such solutions to

get the line proﬁle. In practice the numerical solution to the Schr¨odinger equation can be

straightforward or complicated depending on the electric ﬁeld history. This is the case for

high Z radiators for which the quasi bound orbits described above can give rise to high

frequency, strong ﬁelds (e.g., as in Fig. 6). The calculations require a fast integration

process based on a polynomial development using the so called Euler-Rodrigues coeﬃcients.

A detailed presentation of the method applied to hydrogenic lines has been given elsewhere

[15].

The existing theoretical analysis generally entails further approximations not necessary

in the above MD/Schr¨odinger equation simulation. Due to the small electron-ion mass ratio,

Stark eﬀects resulting from slow ion and fast electron micro-ﬁelds are generally considered

separately. The Stark eﬀect due to ions is approximated by a static electric ﬁeld, while

electron broadening is described as a dynamical process resulting from the high frequency

ﬂuctuation of the electron electric ﬁeld. The usual approach for electron broadening [14] for

ion emitters in plasmas is a binary collision model involving independent electrons moving

on straight trajectories at constant velocity. Electron correlations are accounted for only

indirectly by screening the electron-emitter potential at the Debye length. There are other

theoretical models with diﬀerent approximations, but for the discussion here we will primar-

ily compare simulations for two cases: 1) the electrons are considered as free particles that

do not interact with each other but perturb the ion emitters with a ﬁeld obtained from the

potential written in Eq. (2) with λ = λD; and 2) the electrons have Coulomb interactions

with each other and couple to the emitter with a ﬁeld obtained using Eq. (2) with λ = s/2.

The latter, of course, is the correct treatment of correlations.

A more compact formulation of the problem is obtained using a Liouville operator repre-

19

sentation [16] allowing to disentangle the evolution operator from the internal emitter dipole
operator q. Liouville operators are deﬁned according to the following relation: L0 ≡ 1

i~[H0, ·].
In this representation the dipole correlation function can be rewritten C(t) = T r(q·U(t)ρq).

Equation 5 is replaced by the following stochastic equation for the evolution operator alone:

dUα(t)

= (L0 + D · Eα(t))Uα(t), Uα(0) = 1

where Eα(t) is one of the electric ﬁeld histories, D is the Liouville representation of d and

U(t) denotes the solution of the stochastic equation.

A useful approximation described in Appendix A, the fast ﬂuctuation limit, can be ob-

tained when the characteristic time for the ﬁeld correlation function is much smaller than

the typical relaxation time of the physical process investigated - here the dipole [17]. In this

limit the stochastic equation reduces to:

questions regarding the eﬀects of charge-charge coupling on the linewidth can be addressed

directly from the simulation of the ﬁeld autocorrelation function as described in the previous

sections.

B. Electron broadening

The purpose of this section is to apply the EBT developed herein for discussing the

occurrence of charge-charge coupling eﬀects in electron broadening. This issue is motivated

in part by recent experimental and theoretical studies performed on a series of lines emitted

by ions of increasing charge [9]. The speciﬁcity of these lines relies on the absence of ion

broadening. However, in contrast, the present study concerns lines with ion broadening so

the generalization of the conclusions here to all kinds of lines would be inappropriate. Ion

lines with non negligible ion broadening have been selected as they ﬁt also the objective of

studying Stark broadening in two component plasmas accounting for complete charge-charge

coupling.

20

According to the EBT, the study of electron broadening relies ﬁrst on the construction of

large ﬁeld sample-sets at the emitter generated by molecular dynamics. Then, the lineshape

or simply the full width at half maximum (FWHM), γ(Z, Te), is obtained after numerical

solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation and its average. Due to the various characteristic

times of the problem, a given ﬁeld history can be split into a number of independent samples

depending on the ﬁnal purpose. In the present case, the dipole relaxation simulation requires

samples much more longer than those necessary to obtain the ﬁeld statistical properties. In

addition, the study of electron broadening as a function of the emitter charge can be limited

by calculation costs, since the dipole response of the emitter decreases as the inverse of the

square of the emitter charge. For instance, to carry out an equivalent study with respect

to the noise inherent to this kind of statistical average for emitters of net charge Z = 1

and Z = 8, it would be necessary to generate a ﬁeld sample set and then integrate the

Schr¨odinger equation over a time about 20 times longer for Z = 8 than for case Z = 1.

Accordingly, the present study is limited to cases relevant for the fast ﬂuctuation limit

(FFL) allowing a simpler theoretical representation of the line width and thereby avoiding

the full integration process. It should be noted that, for a given temperature, if conditions

for the FFL are fulﬁlled for a chosen line in the case Z = 1 they are even more relevant

for the same line in the case Z = 8. However, the dipole autocorrelation will be calculated

by complete integration of the Schr¨odinger equation in a few cases in order to check the

FFL and for cross comparisons.

In order to probe the statistical properties of the local

microﬁeld, Balmer-alpha lines for hydrogen like emitters of charge Z = 1, 3, 5, 8 have been

chosen together with the three plasma temperatures T = 5 × 104, 105, 2 × 105K selected

for this study. Both the dipole moments of the lower and the upper level manifolds are

coupled to the perturbing ﬁeld giving rise to the relaxation process and line broadening of

the emitted dipole transition n = 3 → n = 2. Qualitatively, for the Balmer alpha line,

the electric ﬁeld perturbation induces two opposite broadening mechanisms, i.e. the line

broadening increases with the covariance characteristic of the ﬁeld strength while, due to

some time averaging inherent to the dipole relaxation process, it decreases with an increasing

ﬂuctuation dynamics of the perturbation.

Comparisons of the FWHM are reported in Tab. I, where γF F L is the fast ﬂuctuation

limit result and γSE results from simulation i.e. from a full integration of the Schr¨odinger

equation. The discrepancy is smaller than 10% of the FWHM. In addition the exponential

decay of C(t) predicted by the FFL also is conﬁrmed for the simulations (not shown).

For the high temperature case, these results are plotted on a log scale in Fig. 12, versus

the nucleus charge, together with the corresponding independent electron calculations (free

electrons moving on straight trajectories that perturb the emitter via the potential deﬁned

in Eq. 2 screened at the Debye length). The ﬁeld sampling generation cost by the MD

technique is quite low for noninteracting particles. Therefore, these calculations can be

performed by integration of the stochastic equation with a satisfactory noise level. The

FWHM calculations ﬁt the 1/(Z + 1)2 behavior even without coupling to the emitter due to

the atomic physics dependence (dipole matrix elements) of the linewidth. These calculations

conﬁrm the capability of the simulation technique to provide relevant results even in the

22

fast ﬂuctuation limit domain. The entire discrepancy between the two results of Fig. 12

is therefore a consequence of the charge-charge coupling in the time integral of the FCF

as a function of the emitter charge (i.e., the eﬀect discussed in Fig. 8). This discrepancy

increases with decreasing temperature as shown in Fig. 7.

C. Coupled ion-electron broadening

It has been shown in a previous section that classical two component MD simulations

provide relevant results regarding charge structure and dynamics. The plasma conditions

have been selected to emphasize screening mechanisms in order to demonstrate signiﬁcative

eﬀects. Other results obtained for weaker coupling conditions lead to the same observations.

These investigations ensure that ion plus electron ﬁeld samplings are properly generated by

the MD simulation for the plasma conditions of this work. Like for the EBT, ﬁeld sampling

is the ﬁrst stage of the ion electron broadening theory (IEBT). In the second stage these

ﬁelds are used for integrating the Schr¨odinger equation in order to synthesize lineshapes.

This protocol requires a numerical cost much smaller than for the impurity case because 1)

a number of samples are generated at the same time using each ion as the emitter, and 2)

the integration time required for C(t) is shorter when ion broadening is accounted for. Two

ﬁeld data sets are used in order to look for evidences of ion-electron coupling mechanisms at

the lineshape level. The two data-sets are built using TCP molecular dynamics techniques,

1) with all the charge-charge interactions accounted for and, 2) taking into account only the

ion-ion interactions assuming a Debye screening for the ion-ion potential and free electrons

moving on straight trajectories. The observed discrepancy in Fig. 13 is a decrease of 6 − 7%

in the full width at half maximum when both the ion-electron and the electron-electron

coupling are accounted for.

IV. CONCLUSION

Semi-classical models involving a quantum emitter perturbed by a stochastic classical

electric ﬁeld have been developed to calculate emitter dipole relaxation. On this basis

charge correlation eﬀects relevant for plasma spectroscopy have been explored. Such ref-

erence results from ideal numerical experiments are indispensable, particularly when the

plasma conditions are such that the usual theoretical approximations appear questionable.

The calculations reported here are for two distinct models, with and without ion-electron

and electron-electron couplings. They give rise to comparisons of two sets of line broaden-

ing calculations. The observed residual discrepancies conﬁrm that eﬀects of charge-charge

couplings on lineshapes can be non negligible.

Common electron broadening theories do not account for ion-electron couplings. The

main reason is that for most of the ionic lines (normal lines) electron broadening is a small

eﬀect with respect to ion broadening. This has not motivated the development of theories

accounting for the complex problem of the quantum properties of a charged emitter under-

going a perturbation resulting from the electrons around the charge. However, this interest

exists for lines whose broadening is dominated by the electrons. In this work charge-charge

coupling eﬀects on ionic lines have been investigated considering electron broadening of lines

with ion broadening. It is worth analyzing the main results obtained here with the impact

theory for comparison. This theory is founded on the hypothesis that strong collisions do

not overlap in time. Collision operators for electron broadening have been derived on this

basis using either linear or parabolic electron trajectories [18]. For the electrons attracted to

the ion impurity the impact theory postulate of binary encounters is no longer correct as the

close electron trajectories depend on the other close electrons via kinetic energy exchanges,

particularly in the case of temporary orbiting trajectories. Accordingly it can be concluded

24

that ion-electron couplings cannot be treated ignoring electron-electron couplings. In terms

of the electric ﬁeld dynamics, these couplings induce an increase of both the covariance and

the ﬁeld ﬂuctuation rate when the emitter charge or the temperature increase. These eﬀects

result in a decrease of the width of the studied lines in comparison with the uncoupled case.

Both the EBT and the IEBT have been designed to account for all charge-charge cou-

plings. They are based on the numerical integration of the Schr¨odinger equation over a large

electric ﬁeld sample set generated by molecular dynamics techniques. For the selected lines

and plasma conditions the fast ﬂuctuation limit provides a simple theoretical expression for

electron broadening in terms of the time integral of the ﬁeld autocorrelation function. This

approximation has been checked by comparisons with a few results obtained by full integra-

tion of the Schr¨odinger equation. In parallel to this work MD simulations and theoretical

studies of the FCF for an ion impurity in jellium have been carried out with preliminary

results reported in [8]. Thus, the FCF and the fast ﬂuctuation limit provide an eﬃcient pre-

diction of the linewidth for this simple impurity case. In contrast, it appears that integration

of the Schr¨odinger equation appears easier when both ion and electron broadening occur to-

gether, using two component plasma MD simulations for the ﬁeld histories.

It has been

shown here that such TCP simulations reliably yield the proper dynamic electron screening

of the ion-ion forces.

Finally, it can be noted that the direct integration of the Schr¨odinger equation for line-

shapes can be rather intricate and expensive. Despite the apparent diﬃculty of this step by

step integration process, it appears robust enough to give accurate results that can be seen

as ideal experiments providing reference data appropriate to discuss or benchmark other

theories.

APPENDIX A: FAST FLUCTUATION LIMIT

In this Appendix an outline of the fast ﬂuctuation limit for the line proﬁle is given. The

terminology “fast ﬂuctuation limit” used instead of the alternative “impact limit” has been

preferred to avoid confusing it with the impact theories. The later relies on the calculation of

an average binary collision - the collision operator. The impact theories generally postulate

non overlapping strong collisions, which is not a limitation of the fast ﬂuctuation limit

obtained here.

1. Characteristic time scales

Three characteristic time scales have to be considered. First, the typical correlation time

of the perturbing ﬁeld E(t), and in consequence, the characteristic time of L(t). This time

scale is ruled by the kinetics of the charged particles in the plasma. Its order of magnitude

A second time scale is ﬁxed by the correlations of the dipole-moment q(t). The spectral

width is determined by this lifetime, τd, which is, in a way, the “unknown variable” of the

a0 is the B¨ohr radius, n the principal quantum number of the upper group of states. Evo-

lution of the dipole moment q(t) would be ﬁxed by this frequency scale if the perturbing

electric ﬁeld were stationary.

The relationship between τH and τc will determine the relevant physical phenomenon in

spectral line broadening. τc ≥ τH is the condition for “quasistatic” broadening which is a

close limit for ion broadening. Both shape and width of the spectral line are ﬁxed by the

statistical distribution of the perturbing ﬁelds, then τd ∼ τH .

If τc ≪ τH the evolution of the dipole moment q(t) is much slower than the evolution of

the perturbing ﬁelds. This condition ﬁts the electron broadening mechanisms. In this case,

τc ≃

perturbations are less eﬃcient, since the emitter responds to a time average of the electric

ﬁeld smaller than its statistical typical value. It is the fast ﬂuctuation regime. In the next

section it will be seen that in this regime the dipole autocorrelation ﬁts well a decreasing

exponential whose lifetime τd ≫ τH > τc, is determined by the autocorrelation function

of the perturbing ﬁeld. It should be noted that in the present study the ratio τc/τd varies

from a few hundreds to a few thousands. Such a large ratio guarantees that the FFL is

totally relevant as the discrepancy of the dipole autocorrelation function to an exponential

(or equivalently the discrepancy of the lineshape to a Lorentzian) is non signiﬁcant.

The fast ﬂuctuation limit corresponds to the case where the perturber dynamics varies

rapidly on the time scale of the dipole correlation function C(t). Since the average is per-

formed only over the plasma degrees of freedom this time scale is controlled by the perturbers.
Then the ﬂuctuation in Eq. (A10) decays to zero for t′ = τ ≪ t and the factor t′/t in the

For similar reasons, higher order terms in the cumulant expansion are expected to be of

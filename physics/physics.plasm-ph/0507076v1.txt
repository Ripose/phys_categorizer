Self-consistent Monte-Carlo simulation of
the positive column in Argon

V.Zhakhovskii, and K.Nishihara
ILE, Osaka University.∗
(Dated: January 2, 2014)

A high accurate self-consistent Monte-Carlo method including charged and neutral particle mo-
tion and resonance photon transport is developed and applied to simulation of positive column
discharge in Argon. The distribution of power loss across the tube is investigated. It is shown that
negative slope of current-voltage gradient curve can not be explained by only one factor. Diﬀusion
of metastable atoms to the tube wall in the case of low current ( 0.2 − 3 mA) responds for the most
part of negative slope. For the high currents the variation of radiation power loss makes a main
contribution to the amplitude of negative slope.

INTRODUCTION

The positive column of gas discharge has been experi-
mentally studied for a long time but still there are some
lack of the simulation techniques which are able to repro-
duce discharge properties in closed details.

Modeling of the positive column (PC) is based mostly
on ﬂuid approaches, which are inapplicable for sheath re-
gion as well for low pressures and small currents because
they do not reﬂect the physical picture of discharge (due
to assumption of Maxwellian electron distribution func-
tion and simpliﬁed treatment of photon transfer) and re-
sults in inadequate simulation.

As it was well established, electron component of dis-
charge generally reaches a state far from the thermo-
dynamic equilibrium. Hence the temporal and spatial
distributions of anisothermic plasmas can be described
only on appropriate microphysical basis. There are two
quite diﬀerent approaches. One way consists of the for-
mulation of a kinetic equation and its approximate solu-
tion. Until recently, most studies of the electron behavior
in positive columns based on solution of the Boltzmann
equation [1]. The other approach uses the technique of
the particle-in-cell simulation coupled with Monte-Carlo
(MC) event selection. The last method has no disadvan-
tages of the kinetic Boltzmann method, and it is limited
only the available computing power [2, 3].

Electron and ion motions in low temperature plasmas
may be studied by MC approach in which the path of
a single particle is traced by computer simulation. The
particle is considered to move classically during period
of free ﬂight under inﬂuence of a self-consistent electric
ﬁeld. This ﬁeld is determined by electron and ion density
according to Poison’s law. The free ﬂight is interrupted
with scattering by neutral atoms, ionization, excitation,
wall loss and other kind of collisions which must be con-
sidered in the model of discharge. The free ﬂight length

and outcome of these events are selected randomly from
known probability distributions. Transport properties of
the discharge under investigation are found from the time
average of the behavior of the individual particle. When
an collision occurs one of the possible collision mecha-
nisms must be chosen. The probability of each mecha-
nism is proportional to its frequency. Then the particle
velocity is modiﬁed according to the physical nature of
the mechanism chosen. The simulation of a number of
particles may be carried out simultaneously and the time
dependence of their behavior can be derived from an en-
semble average.

Resonance photon transfer is also very important for
a quantitative simulation of gas discharge tube as well
the charged particle motion. A new simple Monte-Carlo
treatment of radiation imprisonment based on Holstein-
Biberman theory [4] is developed and embedded into the
model.

We present a high accurate self-consistent Monte-Carlo
approach to simulation of the positive column of Argon
discharge in this short report.

II. PARTICLE TRANSPORT PROCESSES

At present model the ﬁrst 14 excited Ar levels are
involved into consideration. The 15th level of Argon
Ar15(3da) is a combined level that represents great num-
ber of the higher excited atomic levels as one state. We
assume that Ar may be ionized and excited or de-excited
by electron-atom collisions according to general formula
which can be written as:

e + Ai →

σ(i, j, u)

e + Aj,

→

(1)

where A is atomic symbol, index i denotes initial state
(before collision), j corresponds to the ﬁnal state, and
σ(i, j, u) is a cross section for given pair (i, j) and elec-
tron kinetic energy is u . In the case of i < j Eq.(1) rep-
resents excitations and ionization of atom, elastic scatter-
ing in the case of i = j , and super-elastic electron-atom
collisions for i > j .

cross section from ground state of Ar.

The electron excitation and ionization cross sections
are taken from Refs.[6, 7]. After ionization of atom a new
electron appears. We assume that both the ejected and
scattered electrons are redistributed isotropically, and
both electrons randomly share available energy which is
given by subtracting the ionization energy for a given en-
ergy level from the kinetic energy of the incident electron.
At very low pressure of Argon the excitation of inner
electron shells of atom and multiple ionization becomes
more probable due to the higher electron temperature.
The present model contains very simpliﬁed calculation
of double ionization events and may obtain only quali-
tative description of discharges at electron temperature

Recombination of ions at wall produces the neutral atoms
in ground state. The program redistributes uniformly
these atoms within tube domain to maintain balance of
the atom number density.

In contrast to elastic electron-atom collisions where en-
ergy exchange is limited by factor 2me/M
1 , en-
ergy exchange in electron-electron collision has the same
order as energy of colliding electrons and moreover a
huge electron-electron momentum transfer cross section
(Coulomb cross section). For low axial electric ﬁeld and
not too small current, the electron-electron collisions re-
sult mainly in energy transfer from cold bulk electrons to
hot tail electrons which are responsible for particle (ion-
ization) balance in discharge. So the correct treatment
of electron-electron collisions is one of the key elements
of the discharge simulation.

To describe electron-electron collisions by MC simu-
lation we are using classical Coulomb cross section [10]:

ity vectors of a projectile 1st-particle and target 2nd-
particle according to equations:

are also included to the model in the same manner as
for electron-electron collision. However according to our
simulation these processes do not play any signiﬁcant role
in the PC.

It should be note that for arbitrary projectile-target
pair the relative velocity may be a very small value and
the corresponding Coulomb radius b in Eq.(4) becomes
larger than Debye length and/or spatial mesh size.
In
these cases the electron-electron collision event is as-
sumed as a null collision because the long range electron
interactions are already included in solution of Poisson’s
equation.

Ion transport in the ion-parent-atom case is mostly
guided by resonant charge transfer because of its cross
section is large at low collision energies. We use a simple
ﬁtted function for the charge transfer cross section [11,
12] given by

σcx = (A

B ln ε)2

−

(11)

Here ε [eV] is a kinetic energy of a projectile ion in
CM system, A and B are the ﬁtting parameters:
AAr = 6.65 [˚A] , BAr = 0.3 [˚A], see Fig.2. Due to the
large cross section the ions and atoms are practically un-
deﬂected in the center-of-mass system. Therefore, after
the resonant charge transition occurs a new ion will ac-
cept velocity of the neutral atom which are randomly
generated according normal distribution function for a
given gas temperature which is assumed to be constant
across the tube.

Polarization scattering of ion by a neutral atom can
be described by momentum transfer cross section [13]

IH = e2/2a0 = 13.6 eV is ionization potential of Hydro-
gen atom, and ε = M ′v2/2 is kinetic energy of relative
motion of ion and atom (that is in the CM system). The
polarizability of Argon atom is equal to αAr/a3
0 = 11.08 .
The minimal value of σpl
is limited by the corresponding
gas-kinetic (hard sphere) cross section σgk as shown in
Fig.2. We assume that the ion is redistributed isotropi-
cally in CM system according to Eqs.(5,6) after an elastic
collision with a random neutral atom at a given gas tem-
perature Tg = 20◦C .

Because the correct calculation of ion motion is crucial
point for the gas discharge modeling, we carry out the
validity check of these cross sections by comparing the
simulated ion drift velocity with experimental one. Re-
duced mobility of Ar+ in argon gas is µ0(Ar+, Ar) =
1.6 cm2V−1s−1 [11], hence the experimental drift veloc-
ity for gas pressure 0.261 Torr and electric ﬁeld 2 V/cm
is 93.18 m/s which is in good agreement with simulated
Ar+ drift velocity 92.3 m/s.

about tube axis, the electric ﬁeld E in the cylindrical

It provides us the simple formula

Er(r) = 2Q(r)/r

(17)

where Q(r) is the total charge within radius r per unit
length of discharge tube.

III. RESONANCE RADIATIVE TRANSPORT

Due to the high absorption of the resonance photons
by atoms in the ground state the correct treatment of ra-
diative transfer in discharge condition is very important

for simulation model. We apply the Biberman-Holstein
theory [4] of resonance radiative transport for MC simu-
lation of traveling photons.

In a general case the emission (or absorption) line

but natural and pressure (Lorentz) broadening as well.

dom number Y is picked over. If Y > ρ(k0r) then the
program rejects the trial number k0r and return to the
ﬁrst step. Otherwise the program accept the trial num-
ber. The eﬃciency of this generator is equal 50% because
of
f (k0r)d(k0r) = 2 . Figure 3 indicates that the prob-
ability density generated by random generator Eq.(28) is
in a excellent agreement with theoretical function from
Eq.(26). The transmission probability density ρ(k0r) is
tabulated and stored at ﬁrst start of the program.

IV. PARTICLE BALANCE THEORY

To maintain the charge balance in a steady PC an
electron may produce many excited atoms and only one
electron-ion pair during the electron mean life time. The
exited atoms may disappear by radiative decay, in elec-
tron inelastic or super-elastic collisions, in electron im-
pact and atom-atom ionization processes, and due to dif-
fusion to the tube wall. In our model the ions can only

5

recombine at the tube surface. It is clear that the total
balance of each sort of particles must be equal zero in the
steady positive column.

As example of simpliﬁed theoretical model of PC let
us consider the electron balance equation which can be
written as sum of the volume rates:

νiene +

Xi

Xij

kijninj −

νewne = 0

(29)

where ﬁrst term corresponds to direct ionization from
i-level atoms by electron impact with frequency νie =
kieni
in unit volume, second term denotes atom-atom
ionization in collisions between excited i-level atom and
j-level atom, and third term is electron loss rate on the
tube wall.

In the simplest theory of DC positive column (Schot-
tky, 1924) the electron-wall loss frequency νew is as-
sumed to be independent on electron density ne and
equal to νew = De(2.405/R)2 , where De = µiTe
is
the ambipolar diﬀusion coeﬃcient and Te weakly de-
pends upon the electron density. In the simplest model
of positive column where the ionization from ground
state is only taken into consideration the ionization fre-
quency ν0e does not depend on electron density and
ionization rate ν0ene is linear term with respect to ne .
The electron balance equation Eq.(29) becomes simply
ν0e = νew , therefore electron balance does not depend
on electric current which is proportional to ne . Ioniza-
tion frequency ν0e is a function of the axial electric ﬁeld
Ez . Hence Ez
is independent of electric current and
only determined by electron wall-loss frequency.

We may extend Schottky theoretical model by includ-
ing ionization from one sort of the excited resonance
atoms only as it have been done in [18]:

k0en0ne + kxenxne −

νewne = 0

(30)

νx0nx = 0

k0xn0ne −

kxenxne −
where νx0 = 1/τx is radiative decay frequency of x-level
atom to ground state 0, nx is number density of excited
atoms. By solving Eq.(31) for nx and rewrite Eq.(31)
to obtain balance equation

It is clear that the ionization term in Eq.(32) is superlin-

ear in ne , except the case kxene ≫
For this model we may conclude that the ionization from
resonance states results in negative slope of V-I charac-
teristic curve [18]. It is interesting to note that for high
current case and/or for metastable atom with νx0 = 0
the balance equation (32) gives a ﬂat V-I curve.

Let us consider in contrast to [18] the same model
Eqs.(30,31) but now for metastable x-level atoms with

For this model in the enough low current case ( kxene <
νx0 ) the ionization from metastable states causes a neg-
ative V-I slope. Because the number of metastable atoms
is much higher than the number of resonance atoms in
low current region Eq.(35) conforms to the discharge
much better than Eqs.(30,31). Hence we may conclude
the diﬀusion of metastable atoms to the tube wall is an
essential requirement for a negative V-I characteristic of
the low current positive column.

The atom-atom ionization should be included in any
realistic model. Let us insert this atom-atom ionization
term kxxn2

Again for the enough low current case ( kxene < νx0 )
Eq.(38) shows two superlinear ionization terms, the ﬁrst
is atom-atom ionization and the second is electron im-
pact ionization from metastable atoms. These super-
linear terms result in negative slope of V-I curve. But
with increasing of current the atom-atom ionization
term kxxw2n2
(al-
most independent of ne ), but the impact ionization from
metastable atoms tends to linear term in ne .
It may
cause a positive slope of V-I curve if kxe < kxxw. For
further increasing of current we have to take in considera-
tion the electron impact ionization from resonance states
(see Eq.(33,34)) and transitions between metastable and
resonance states. It adds to Eq.(38) a new superlinear
ionization term which have to turn V-I curve from the
growth to the drop of voltage. Therefore the unknown
whole electron balance equations have to contain the ion-
ization rates consisting from the sublinear, linear, and su-
perlinear terms as we show above. The interplay between

them results in a slope of V-I curve. We may distinguish
at least three electric current region in accordance with
slope sign of the V-I curve. Low current region (ioniza-
tion from metastable atom kxene < νx0 ) corresponds
to the negative slope, the middle current region is for
the positive slope (due to independence of atom-atom
ionization rate on ne ), and the high current region cor-
responds again to the negative slope ( due to superlinear

ionization from excited atoms kxe > kxxw ).

We have to note that this theoretical model is not ap-
plicable for very low current PC where the electron-wall
loss frequency νew depends on electron density ne ,
and the electron temperature signiﬁcantly grows with
decreasing of current. The general condition to be sat-
isﬁed for maintenance of the column can be written as
Irτe = 1 , where τe
is a mean life time of an electron
( τe ∼= τi = τe(Ni/Ne) at steady conditions). It is clear
(and easy to see on simulation data) that lower electron
density/current discharge results in more strong radial
in bulk plasma and relatively smaller
electric ﬁeld Er
one in sheath than in higher current case. Under the
inﬂuence of this radial ﬁeld the ions are accelerated to-
wards tube wall much faster in the lower current PC. The
ni/ni
cause of that the mean ion velocity vi = µiE
is mostly determined by ﬁrst term and almost does not
depends on a variation of ion density proﬁle. Therefore
the mean life time of ions/electrons is longer for higher
current PC and, hence, ionization rate per a electron
must decrease with increasing of current to sustain the
discharge at balance. This conclusion is quite general
but it can not directly determine the slope of voltage-
current curve. Nevertheless, for the simplest model (or
for enough small current) where the ionization rate de-
pends strongly on axial electric ﬁeld Ez , the equilibrium
axial electric ﬁeld Ez have to be also less for higher cur-
rent positive column [19].

Finally we may conclude that the developed particle
balance theory itself can not predict precisely the sign
of V-I slope because the axial electric ﬁeld Ez responds
ﬁrst of all for energy balance in discharge. Energy bal-
ance equations are much more complicated and detail
information about energy transfers and conversions can
be obtained by simulation only.

V. ENERGY BALANCE IN SIMULATED PC

Electrons acquire kinetic energy from the axial elec-
tric ﬁeld Ez , from superelastic collisions, from excited
atom-atom ionization and lose it in the electron-wall and
electron-atom collisions. Ions gain kinetic energy mostly
from the radial electric ﬁeld Er and lose it in the ion-
atom and ion-wall collisions. Excited atoms in their turn
gain/lose energy by the electron hits and radiative tran-
sitions, and lose energy by diﬀusion to the tube wall. Our
MC program provides detailed information on these all
processes included in the model. According to our simu-
lation the distribution of power loss across the tube is not
uniform. Figure 6 shows strong nonuniformity in the spa-
tial dependencies of elastic electron-atom and ion-atom
power loss in pure argon discharge simulation. Elastic
(and charge exchange) ion-atom collisions becomes more
important than elastic electron-atom power loss near the
tube wall due to strong acceleration of ions by radial
electric ﬁeld, especially in the sheath.

It is evident that the input electric power must be qual

to the total wasted power at a steady positive column.
Energy balance equation can be written as follow:

W = IEz =

Wn

(40)

Xn

The program calculates independently the input elec-
tric power W = IEz and the dissipated powers Wn
for the each energetic n-channel such as light emission,
electron-atom and ion-atom elastic collisions, ionization,
diﬀusion of excited atoms to the tube wall, electron-wall
and ion-wall losses. Simulation shows that the power bal-
ance maintains with a good accuracy. To reveal the in-
ﬂuence of dissipating n-channel on the axial electric ﬁeld
Ez we may rewrite Eq.(40) as

Ez =

Wn/I =

En

Xn

Xn

(41)

where En is a partial axial ﬁeld which corresponds to
n-channel of the total power dissipation. By using the

partial electric ﬁeld En we may easily estimate contri-
bution of each n-channel to the total energy loss in a
steady PC and, moreover, determine the real atomic rea-
sons behind variation of measured axial ﬁeld Ez .

The MC program is able to predict the experimental
voltage-pressure and voltage-current curve (see Figures
4-5). The negative slope ∆Ez in V-I curve on Fig.4 can
be decompose on partial components ∆En of total elec-
n ∆En/∆Ez
tric ﬁeld Ez according to equality 1 =
from Eq.(41). As it is shown in Table I the most consid-
erable (not for Ez but for derivative dEz/dI ) power
loss channel is diﬀusion of metastable atoms to the tube
wall in the case of low current ( 0.2
3 mA). For the
high currents the variation of radiation power loss makes

P

−

a main contribution to the amplitude of negative slope.
The Figures 4-5 also show radiative eﬃciency of the
lamp measured as a ratio of radiated power to the total
dissipated electric power. The maximum of eﬃciency co-
incides with the maximum of the voltage-pressure curve
at pressure around 0.2 Tor and near 20 mA current.

Abstract

The equilibrium of a resistive axisymmetric plasma with purely toroidal
ﬂow surrounded by a conductor is investigated within the framework of the
nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic theory. It is proved that a) the poloidal
current density vanishes and b) apart from an idealized case the pressure
proﬁle should vanish on the plasma boundary. For the cases of isothermal
magnetic surfaces, isentropic magnetic surfaces and magnetic surfaces with
constant density, the equilibrium states obey to an elliptic partial diﬀer-
ential equation for the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function, which is identical
in form to the corresponding equation governing ideal equilibria. The con-
ductivity, which can not be either uniform or a surface quantity, results
however in a restriction of the possible classes of equilibrium solutions, e.g.
for the cases considered the only possible equilibria with Spitzer conduc-
tivity are of cylindrical shape.

I. Introduction

The understanding of the equilibrium properties of a magnetically conﬁned
plasma is one of the basic objectives of fusion research. The major part of the
studies to date has been devoted to static magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equi-
libria of an axisymmetric plasma. They are governed by a partial elliptic dif-
ferential equation for the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function ψ, which contains two
surface quantities [i.e. the pressure P (ψ) and the poloidal current I(ψ)], known as
Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation (L¨ust and Schl¨uter 1957; Grad 1958; Shafra-
nov 1958).

In the presence of ﬂow the equilibrium becomes more complicated. Although
equilibrium studies of ﬂowing plasmas began in the mid 1950s (e.g. Grad 1960),
since the early 1980s there has been an increasing interest in the investigation of
the equilibrium properties of plasmas with mass ﬂow (Zehrfeld and Green 1972;
Maschke and Perrin 1980; Morozov and Solov´ev 1980; Hameiri 1983; Clemente
and Farengo 1984; Semenzato et al 1984; Kerner and Tokuda 1987; Throumoulopou-
los and Pantis 1989; Avinash et al 1992; ˙Zelazny et al 1993; Throumoulopoulos
and Pantis 1996; Throumoulopoulos and Tasso 1997) which was motivated by the
observation of plasma rotation in many tokamaks heated by neutral beams (Suck-
ewer et al 1979; Brau et al 1983; Core et al 1987; Scott et al 1989; Tammen et al
1994) With the adoption of a speciﬁc equation of state, e.g. isentropic magnetic
surfaces (Morozov and Solov´ev 1980), the axisymmetric ideal MHD equilibrium
states obey to a partial diﬀerential equation for ψ, containing ﬁve surface quan-
tities, in conjunction with a nonlinear algebraic Bernouli equation. Unlike the
case in static equilibria, the above mentioned diﬀerential equation is not always
elliptic; there are three critical values of the poloidal ﬂow at which the type of
this equation changes, i.e.
it becomes alternatively elliptic and hyperbolic. To
solve the equilibrium problem in the two elliptic regions, several computer codes
have been developed (Semenzato et al 1984; Kerner and Tokuda 1987; ˙Zelazny et
al 1993). There is experimental evidence, however, that either the ﬂow is purely
toroidal (Suckewer et al 1979; Core et al 1987; Scott et al 1989; Tammen et al
1994) or its poloidal component is one order of magnitude lower than the toroidal
one (Brau et al 1983). It was also found that the poloidal ﬂow is eﬃciently damped
by magnetic pumping (Hassam and Kulsrud 1978). In addition, toroidal rotation
has been suggested as a possible means of creating a magnetic ﬁeld in the sun

3

and stars (Plumpton and Ferraro 1955) and of stabilizing the tilting (Hayashi
and Sato 1987), ballooning (Miller et al 1995) and drift-like (Sen and Rusbridge
1995) modes. Therefore toroidal ﬂow may be considered a dominant eﬀect. For
a purely toroidal velocity component the partial diﬀerential equation becomes
elliptic and can be solved analytically (Maschke and Perrin 1980; Clemente and
Farengo 1984; Throumoulopoulos and Pantis 1989).

The investigation of the general MHD equilibrium, involving plasma ﬂow,
ﬁnite conductivity and viscosity is a very diﬃcult problem, particularly in light
of the uncertainties in the viscous stress tensor. For example, for the case in
which the mean free path is greater than a gyroradius, as it is in the case of a
tokamak, the “ion parallel viscosity” (Braginskii 1965; Balescu 1988) takes an
extraordinary large value, so large as to make the applicability of either version
of the MHD viscosity stress tensor to tokamak dynamics questionable. It may
be noted, however, that the ion parallel viscosity ﬁrst increases strongly with
the temperature until the mean free path reaches the order of magnitude of the
machine, then decreases for larger values of the mean free path. In particular,
in the high viscosity regime resistive equilibria with ﬂows originated from paired
toroidal vortices, which are very likely created in a toroidal magnetoﬂuid, were
investigated recently (Montgomery Bates and Li 1997a); the existence of such
vortices is however conjectured to characterize magnetoﬂuids beyond the high-
viscosity limit. Thus, the form and the magnitude of the appropriate viscous
stress tensor to be used in tokamak MHD has been the subject of considerable
discussion, and at present these discussions show no signs of converging.

For an inviscid plasma Pﬁrsch and Schl¨uter (Pﬁrsch and Schl¨uter 1962; see
also Wesson 1987) showed long time ago that in the collisional regime the toroidal
curvature gives rise to an enhanced diﬀusion, which is related to the conductivity
parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. Since then there have been attempts to examine
the eﬀects of ﬁnite conductivity (e.g. Grad and Hogan 1970), but these attempts
appear not having led to a satisfactory resolution; too many possibilities are
raised to be able to deal with any one of them conclusively. In the above men-
tioned studies the inertial-force ﬂow term ρ(v · ∇)v is neglected in the equation
of momentum conservation. For ion ﬂow velocities of the order of 107 cm/sec,
which have been observed in neutral-beam-heating experiments (Suckewer et al
1979; Brau 1983 et al; Tammen et al 1994), however, the term ρ(v · ∇)v can not

4

be considered negligible. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the nonlinear
resistive equilibrium. Such an investigation is also encouraged by a proof (Tasso
1979) according to which a conductivity proﬁle remaining constant on a magnetic
surface is not compatible with the Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation. The non
existence of static axisymmetric resistive equilibria with a uniform conductivity
was also suggested recently (Montgomery and Shan 1994; Bates and Lewis 1996;
Montgomery et al 1997b).

In the present paper we study the MHD equilibrium of an axisymmetric
plasma with scalar conductivity and purely toroidal ﬂow surrounded by a con-
ductor, including the term ρ(v · ∇)v in the momentum conservation equation.
It is found that the presence of ﬂow does not remove the above mentioned in-
compatibilities associated with the conductivity. Also, the conductivity has an
impact on the direction of the current density, on the boundary conditions and
restricts the possible classes of equilibrium solutions.

The paper is organized as follows. For the system under consideration equilib-
rium equations independent of the plasma equation of state are derived in Sec. II.
The cases of equilibria with (a) isothermal (b) isentropic and (c) constant density
magnetic surfaces are examined in Sec. III. Sec. IV summarizes our conclusions.

II. Equilibrium equations

The MHD equilibrium states of an inviscid plasma with scalar conductivity
are governed by the following set of equations, written in standard notations and
convenient units:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

∇ · (ρv) = 0

ρ(v · ∇)v = j × B − ∇P

∇ × E = 0

∇ × B = j

∇ · B = 0

E + v × B =

It is pointed out that, unlike to the usual procedure followed in equilibrium stud-
ies with ﬂow (Zehrfeld and Green 1972; Morozov and Solov´ev 1980; Hameiri
˙Zelazny
1983; Semenzato Gruber and Zehrfeld 1984; Kerner and Tokuda 1987;

et al 1993) in the present work an equation of state is not included in the above
set of equations from the outset and therefore the equation of state independent
Eqs. (17) and (18) below are ﬁrst derived. This alternative procedure is conve-
nient because the equilibrium problem is further reduced then for speciﬁc cases
associated with several equations of state.

The system under consideration is a toroidal axisymmetric magnetically con-
ﬁned plasma, which is surrounded by a conductor (Fig. 1). Cylindrical coordi-
nates R, φ, z are employed with unit basis vectors eR, eφ, ez, where ez is parallel
to the axis of symmetry. The position of the surface of the conductor is speci-
ﬁed by some boundary curve in the (R, z) plane. The equilibrium quantities do
not depend on the azimuthal coordinate φ. Also, it is assumed that the plasma
elements ﬂow solely along eφ. Eq. (1) is then identically satisﬁed.

For the above mentioned system we ﬁrst prove that the equilibrium poloidal

current density must vanish. Inserting the expression

for the magnetic ﬁeld into Ampere’s law (4) yields for the current density:

B = Bφeφ + Bpol = Bφeφ +

∇ψ × eφ

j = −

∆⋆ψeφ +

∇(RBφ) × eφ.

Here, ψ is the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function which labels the magnetic surfaces,
and ∆⋆ is the elliptic operator deﬁned by ∆ψ = R2∇ · (∇ψ/R2). With the aid
of Eqs. (7) and (8), the component of the force balance equation (2) along eφ is
written in the form

Eq. (9) implies that RBφ is a surface quantity:

eφ · ∇(RBφ) × ∇ψ = 0.

RBφ ≡ I(ψ).

closed magnetic surface with the poloidal plane (Fig. 1) leads to the equation

Since in equilibrium it holds that ∂B/∂t = 0, the ﬁrst integral vanishes by Stokes’s
theorem. Also, the second integral vanishes because v is purely toroidal. Con-
sequently, the term on the right-hand side must vanish, implying that jpol ≡ 0
and therefore I = constant.

The φ-component of the electric ﬁeld associated with the current density can

be obtained from Faraday’s law (3):

Eφ =

(12)

where E0 is the value of the electric ﬁled in the cylindrical surface R = R0. An
electric ﬁeld of this kind can be created by a linear change in time of the magnetic
ﬂux conﬁned to an axisymmetric very long iron core, which is directed along ez
and is located within the hole of the torus. This can be considered as a highly
simpliﬁed representation of a tokamak.

Eq. (12) has an impact on the boundary conditions, i.e. the component of E
tangential to the plasma-conductor interface does not vanish. Therefore, apart
from a special idealized situation in which the surface of a perfectly conducting
container is coated by a very thin layer of insulating dielectric (Bates and Lewis
1996; Montgomery et al 1997b) the container can not be considered perfectly
conducting. Accordingly, Ohm’s law with ﬁnite conductivity applied in the vicin-
ity of the plasma-conductor interface does not permit the existence of a surface
layer of current. It is now assumed that the position of the conductor is such
that its surface coincides with the outermost of the closed magnetic surfaces.
Thus, the condition B · n = 0, where n is an outward unit vector normal to the
plasma surface (Fig. 1), holds in the plasma-conductor interface. It is noticed
that this is possible only in equilibrium, because in the context of resistive MHD
time dependent equations, the magnetic ﬂux is not conserved.
Integration of
the momentum conservation equation across the plasma-conductor interface and
projection of the resulting equation parallel to n yields (with B being continuous
in the plasma-conductor interface)

P + ρ(n · v)2 = 0.

Since all the terms of Eq. (13) are non-negative and the ﬂow is purely toroidal,
it follows that the pressure P must vanish at the plasma boundary.

To reduce the equilibrium equations (1)-(6), a second surface quantity is iden-

tiﬁed by projecting the equation

Equation (15) implies that the angular frequency of the ﬂow shares the same
surfaces with ψ:

With the aid of equations (7), (8) with I = const., (10) and (16), the components

forms, respectively,

It is noted here that Eqs. (9), (17) and (18) are orthogonal components of Eq.
(2) and therefore they are independent.

Summarizing, the resistive MHD equilibrium of an axisymmetric toroidal

plasma with purely toroidal ﬂow is governed by the set of Eqs. (17), 18) and

(16)

(17)

(18)

∆⋆ψ + R0E0σ = 0,

(19)

following from Eqs. (8) and (12). Owing to the purely toroidal direction of the
ﬂow, which leads to jpol = 0 and ω = ω(ψ), Eqs. (17) and (18) do not contain
the conductivity and are identical in form to the corresponding equations govern-
ing ideal equilibria. Therefore, on the one side, several properties of the ideal
equilibria, e.g. the Shafranov shift of the magnetic surfaces and the detachment
of the isobaric surfaces from the magnetic surfaces (see the discussion following
Eq. (22) below) remain valid. On the other side, Eq. (19) can be employed as
an algebraic equation for the conductivity i.e. the solutions of the “ideal MHD”
equations (17) and (18) can determine the spatial dependence of σ by means of
the formula

1
R0E0
Eq. (20) implies that the conductivity can not be uniform, as the case in static
equilibria (Tasso 1979; Montgomery and Shan 1994; Bates and Lewis 1996; Mont-
gomery et al 1997b).

It may be noted here that the equilibrium problem can be treated in a diﬀerent
way, suggested for the case of static resistive equilibria (Bates and Lewis 1996),
i.e. Eq. (19) is employed as an elliptic partial diﬀerential equation for ψ, which is
solved after the spatial dependence of σ is assigned. To our opinion, this method
has two drawbacks: a) A physically unjustiﬁable assignment of conductivity is
required from the outset. b) The conductivity proﬁle must be compatible with Eq.
(18), a requirement which (at least in the presence of ﬂow) makes the assignment
diﬃcult. This becomes more clear in next section [see Eqs. (23), (29) and (33)].

III Magnetic surfaces with special properties

In order to further reduce the equilibrium equations (17) and (18) and ﬁnd
out their inﬂuence on the conductivity proﬁle, the starting set of equations (1)-(6)
must be supplemented by an equation of state, e.g. P = P (ρ, T ), along with an
equation determining the transport of internal energy such as

Cv

∂
∂t

 

!

+ v · ∇

T + P ∇ · v + κ∇2T = 0,

(21)

the energy transport equation for a perfect gas, where Cv is the volume speciﬁc
heat, κ the thermal conductivity and ∂T
= 0. Such a rigorous treatment, how-
∂t
ever, makes the equilibrium problem very cumbersome. Alternatively, since for
fusion plasmas the thermal conduction along B is expected to be fast in relation to
the heat transport perpendicular to a magnetic surface, equilibria with isothermal
magnetic surfaces is a reasonable approximation (e.g. Mashke and Perrin 1980;
Clemente and Farengo 1984; Throumoulopoulos and Pantis 1989). In particular,
the even simpler case of isothermal resistive equilibria (T = constant) has also
been considered (Grad and Hogan 1970). Equilibria with isothermal magnetic
surfaces are examined as follows.

Equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces

In addition to T = T (ψ) the plasma is assumed to obey the perfect gas law
P = λρT . For this kind of equilibria, Eq. (17) can be integrated yielding an
expression for the pressure:

P = PT (ψ) exp

R2ω2
2λT !

.

 

(22)

9

We note here that, unlike in static equilibria, in the presence of ﬂow magnetic
surfaces do not coincide with isobaric surfaces because Eq. (2) implies that B·∇P
in general diﬀers from zero. In this respect, the term PT (ψ) is the static part of
the pressure (ω = 0). Inserting Eq. (22) into Eq. (18), the latter takes the form

(23)

where the prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to ψ. This is the equilibrium
equation for a resistive plasma with purely toroidal ﬂow and isothermal magnetic
surfaces. It contains the three arbitrary surface quantities T (ψ), ω(ψ) and PT (ψ),
which must be found from other physical considerations. For ω ≡ 0 it reduces to
the Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation for vanishing poloidal current. For ideal
(23) was obtained by Maschke and Perrin (1980). For special
equilibria, Eq.
choices of the surface quantities, which must lead to physically reasonable proﬁles
for the equilibrium quantities, Eq. (23) can be linearized and solved analytically.
In particular, with the ansatz ω2/(2λT ) ≡ ωT = const. it takes the simpler form

∆⋆ψ + R2PT (ψ)′ exp

Solutions of Eq.

1989) and the detachment of the isobaric surfaces from the magnetic surfaces was
evaluated.

(25)

As the case in static equilibria (Tasso 1970; Montgomery and Shan 1994) toroidal
equilibria with the conductivity remaining constant in a magnetic surface are not
possible. Indeed, if σ = σ(ψ) the left-hand side of Eq. (25) becomes a surface
quantity, while the right-hand side (in addition to surface quantities) involves an
explicit dependence of R. Considering the variables R and ψ, instead of R and
z, as independent [then z = z(R, ψ)], Eq. (25), after expanding the exponential
∞
n=0 an(ψ)Rn = 0. The
term in a Taylor series, can be written in the form
latter requires that the relation an(ψ) ≡ 0 must be satisﬁed for all n. This is
impossible because a0 = E0R0σ(ψ) and therefore it follows that ψ = ψ(R). Thus,

P

10

the only possible σ = σ(ψ) equilibria are of cylindrical shape. It may be noted
here that the non existence of another class of resistive toroidal MHD equilibria,
i.e. axisymmetric incompressible βp = 1 equilibria with purely poloidal ﬂow, was
proved by Tasso (1970).

To ﬁnd out whether the above incompatibilities associated with the conduc-
tivity proﬁle arise from the choice T = T (ψ), one alternatively can consider the
cases of isentropic processes and incompressible ﬂows, which has been the sub-
ject of extensive ideal MHD studies and are, respectively, associated with isen-
tropic magnetic surfaces (Maschke and Perrin 1980; Morozov and Solov´ev 1980;
Hameiri 1983; Semenzato et al 1984; Kerner and Tokuda 1987; Throumoulopou-
los and Pantis 1989; ˙Zelazny et al 1993) and constant density magnetic surfaces
(Avinash et al 1992; Throumoulopoulos and Pantis 1996; Throumoulopoulos and
Tasso 1997).

Equilibria with isentropic magnetic surfaces

We consider a plasma with large but ﬁnite conductivity such that for times
short compared with the diﬀusion time scale, the dissipative term ≈ j2/σ can
be neglected. This permits one to assume that the magnetic surfaces are isen-
tropic, i.e S = S(ψ) where S is the plasma speciﬁc entropy. It may be noted
that S = S(ψ) can be proved for the stationary states of an ideal plasma with
arbitrary ﬂows on the basis of the entropy conservation (Morozov and Solov´ev
1980; Hameiri 1983). This case was also studied for ideal equilibria with purely
toroidal ﬂow (Maschke and Perrin 1980; Throumoulopoulos and Pantis 1989).
In addition, the plasma is assumed to being a perfect gas whose internal energy
density E is simply proportional to the temperature. Then, the equations for the
thermodynamic potentials lead to (Maschke and Perrin 1980)

and

P = A(S)ργ

E =

(26)

(27)

Here, A = A(S) is an arbitrary function of the speciﬁc entropy S ≡ S(ψ),
H = E + P/ρ is the speciﬁc enthalpy and γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats. For

11

simplicity and without loss of generality we choose the function A to be identical
with S. Consequently, integration of Eq. (17) yields

quantities are now ω(ψ), S(ψ) and θ(ψ). With the ansatz ω2/(2θ) = ωs = const.,
Eq. (29) is put in the simpler form

(Throumoulopoulos and Pantis 1989).

Eqs. (20) and (29) imply that toroidal isentropic equilibria are not compatible
with σ = σ(ψ). In addition, equilibria with Spitzer conductivity σ = aT 3/2 satisfy
the equation

magnetic surfaces and σ = σ(ψ), equilibria with isentropic magnetic surfaces and
Spitzer conductivity must have cylindrical shape.

Equilibria with magnetic surfaces of constant density

Equilibria with incompressible ﬂows are usually associated with constant den-
sity magnetic surfaces (Avinash et al 1992; Throumoulopoulos and Pantis 1996;
Throumoulopoulos and Tasso 1997). For axisymmetric equilibria with purely
toroidal ﬂow, Eqs. (1) and ∇ · v = 0 are satisﬁed identically and provide no
information about ρ. Nevertheless, ρ = ρ(ψ) is a physically possible equation of
state. For this case, integration of Eq. (17) leads to

P = Pρ(ψ) +

where Pρ(ψ) is the static equilibrium pressure. Consequently, Eq. (18) reduces

Concluding this subsection, we derive two classes of exact solutions of Eq.

(33). With the use of the ansatz

Eq. (33) reduces to

ρω2 = const,

∆⋆ψ + R2P ′

ρ = 0,

which is identical in form to the the Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation for van-
ishing poloidal current. A simple solution of Eq. (36) can be derived for Pρ ∝ ψ

Here, ψc is the value of the ﬂux function at the position of the magnetic axis (z =

z can be expressed in terms of Coulomb wave functions and describe equilibria
of either a tokamak with rectangular cross section (Hernegger 1972; Maschke
1973) or a compact torus contained within a rectangular conductor (Berk at al
1981). These solutions can yield a peaked current density proﬁle vanishing on
the boundary. Owing to the presence of the ﬂow term in Eq. (32) however the
pressure does not vanish on the boundary, as it should for resistive equilibria.
Thus, solutions of this kind are not valid in the vicinity of the boundary. The
drawbacks of the solutions presented above in this paragraph, arise from the
choices (35) and Pρ ∝ ψ. They can be eliminated if, alternatively, the ansatz
ρω2 = kψ2 and Pρ = µψ2/2 is employed, where k and µ are constants. Then, Eq.
(33) reduces to

∆⋆ψ + R2

µ + kR2

ψ = 0.

The last equation can not be solved analytically and numerical solutions will not
be derived here.

IV. Conclusions

The equilibrium of an axisymmetric plasma with scalar conductivity and
purely toroidal ﬂow surrounded by a conductor was investigated within the frame-
work of the nonlinear MHD theory. It was found that a) the poloidal current
density jpol must vanish and b) apart from an idealized case, perfect-conducting-
boundary conditions are not relevant. The equilibrium states are governed by a
set of two diﬀerential equations [Eqs. (17) and (18)], which do not contain the
conductivity and are identical in form to the corresponding equations for ideal
stationary equilibria. The conductivity, however, restricts the allowed equilibria
to those that satisfy jpol = 0 and have pressure proﬁles vanishing on the bound-
ary. With the assumption of a speciﬁc equation of state, the above mentioned
set of equations reduces to a single elliptic partial diﬀerential equation for the
poloidal magnetic ﬂux function which contains three surface quantities [e.g. Eqs.
(23), (29), (33)]. The cases of isothermal magnetic surfaces, isentropic magnetic
surfaces and magnetic surfaces of constant density were examined and, for spe-
ciﬁc choices of the surface quantities involved in each case, equilibrium solutions
were presented and discussed.

As the case in static equilibria, the conductivity can not be uniform. In addi-
tion, for all three cases of equation of state examined, the conductivity can not
be a surface quantity; the only possible equilibria with conductivity remaining
constant in a magnetic surface have cylindrical shape. Also, for isentropic mag-
netic surfaces and magnetic surfaces of constant density, it was shown the non
existence of toroidal equilibria with Spitzer conductivity.

It is interesting to investigate whether these unusual properties of conductivity
persist when additional physical input, e.g. a general ﬂow with non vanishing
poloidal and toroidal components is included. Of course, pursuing such kind
of investigations, one gets a step closer to the cumbersome problem of MHD
equilibrium with ﬂow, ﬁnite conductivity and viscosity. The results of the few
studies which have been conducted to date indicate, however, that this objective
may be of crucial importance for fusion plasmas.

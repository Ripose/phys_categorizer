The saturation of the tearing mode instability is desribed within the standard framework of redued magne-

tohydrodynamis (RMHD) in the ase of an r-dependent or of a uniform resistivity pro(cid:28)le. Using the tehnique

of mathed asymptoti expansions, where the perturbation parameter is the island width w, the problem an be

solved in two ways: with the so-alled (cid:29)ux oordinate method, whih is based on the fat that the urrent pro(cid:28)le

is a (cid:29)ux funtion, and with a new perturbative method that does not use this property. The latter is appliable to

more general situations where an external foring or a sheared veloity pro(cid:28)le are involved. The alulation pro-

vides a new relationship between the saturated island width and the

stability parameter that involves a

∆′

ln w/w0

term, where w0 is a nonlinear saling length that was missing in previous work. It also yields the modi(cid:28)ation of

the equilibrium magneti (cid:29)ux funtion.

INTRODUCTION

In magnetized plasmas with urrent inhomogeneities, magneti islands an develop as the onsequene

of tearing mode instabilities. This mode orresponds to a global magneti perturbation that is resonant

on a magneti surfae where its wave-number is perpendiular to the magneti (cid:28)eld. From a theoretial

viewpoint, the instability is allowed by non-ideal plasma e(cid:27)ets suh as resistivity

, eletron inertia

and

1

2

more generally kineti e(cid:27)ets

. On the resonane surfae, there is a modulated urrent sheet whose

3 ,4

urrent density is proportional to the lassial tearing mode stability parameter ∆′

. This parameter,

whose preise de(cid:28)nition is reviewed below, depends solely on the ideal magnetohydrodynamis (MHD)

properties of the system. Instability ours when ∆′

exeeds a ritial value, (∆′ > ∆c ≥

0). This value

depends on the atual physis inluded in the model. For instane, in viso-resistive MHD, ∆c is a funtion

of visosity and resistivity

. Above the ritial value, the resonant magneti surfae an break up (tear)

5,6

and is substituted by a hain of topologially distint strutures alled magneti islands. Until reently,

tokamak operation avoided the formation of suh islands, sine they result in greater radial transport

and hene deteriorate partile and energy on(cid:28)nement. However, in ertain experimental onditions, a

magneti island may help the plasma form a stable internal transport barrier

. In the reversed-(cid:28)eld pinh

7

(RFP), the ourrene of several magneti island hains leads to magneti haos with redued on(cid:28)nement,

but the formation of a single hain is desirable, sine it should provide good magneti (cid:29)ux surfaes and

a laminar dynamo. Therefore, a orret desription and understanding of the nonlinear tearing mode is

both important for thermonulear fusion and for advaning the theory of plasma self-organization.

In the theory of magneti island formation, nonlinear e(cid:27)ets ome into play as soon as the island width

exeeds the width of the boundary layer at the resonant surfae, as given by linear theory. The nonlinear

tearing mode is lassially desribed by applying resistive redued magnetohydrodynamis

(RRMHD) to

the model of a stati plasma slab, in the limit of small dissipation. The magneti island region is onsidered

as a boundary layer whose nonlinear features are dealt with, while the outer region is adequately desribed

by linear theory only. The inner and outer solutions are then mathed asymptotially. Rutherford

showed

9

that the island growth is su(cid:30)iently slow that inertia an be negleted in the inner solution. The (cid:29)uid

equations of RRMHD then redue to a mere fore balane (Grad-Shafranov) equation. Rutherford also

showed that the island width w grows with a linear time dependene in the early (small island) nonlinear

phase. A quasilinear alulation predited a further nonlinear slowing down of this growth

.

The saturation of the tearing mode is a di(cid:30)ult issue, and its solution has been a stepwise proess

overing almost three deades. In 1977, a seminal work using a quasilinear alulation provided a (cid:28)rst

version of the formula ∆′(wsat) linking ∆′
to the saturation amplitude wsat of the island width
a new tehnique was introdued to deal with the ase of a non vanishing urrent gradient J ′
eq(rs) on the
resonant surfae, and gave the orret expression for the leading order term in wsat of ∆′(wsat) in this

11

. In 1981,

ase

. A later work provided a further term in this expression together with (cid:28)nite β orretions
term and (cid:28)nite β orretions were also given in Ref. 14. In 2004, the rigorous expression for ∆′(wsat)
was provided for the ase J ′

eq(rs) = 0 (Harris sheet pinh) by two di(cid:27)erent tehniques, one of whih uses

. This

13

expliitly the fat that the urrent pro(cid:28)le is a (cid:29)ux funtion

, while the other does not

.

15

16

The aim of this paper is to provide a deeper insight in the nonlinear tearing mode by introduing, in

partiular, a powerful perturbation tehnique whih does not use the fat that the urrent pro(cid:28)le is a (cid:29)ux

funtion. This makes possible, whenever useful, to avoid the assumption that plasma inertia, pressure or

visous e(cid:27)ets are negligible, whih opens a new route to deal with a bakground veloity pro(cid:28)le and/or

an external rotating foring. Furthermore, whenever the urrent pro(cid:28)le is a (cid:29)ux funtion, we show that

the tehnique introdued in Ref. 12 an be simpli(cid:28)ed to make the derivation more diret, whih divides

by more than two the neessary algebra. As in all the above quoted works, wsat is assumed to be a small
parameter in both of our tehniques, and ∆′(wsat) is omputed in a perturbative way for the ase of a
ylindrial geometry for any urrent gradient J ′

eq(0).

Referene 17 provides a short presentation of the new perturbative tehnique in slab geometry by the

same authors. Our (cid:28)nal formula for ∆′(wsat) depends on wsat through a term wsat ln (wsat/w0) where w0

is a nonlinear sale length whih was absent in previous work. We show that the nonlinear tearing mode

omes with a modi(cid:28)ation of the bakground magneti (cid:29)ux. It should also ome with a modi(cid:28)ation of the

resistivity pro(cid:28)le. Indeed, sine temperature is typially uniform on a given magneti (cid:29)ux surfae, so is

the resistivity. Therefore, the development of a magneti island is bound to (cid:29)atten the resistivity pro(cid:28)le.

Sine our RRMHD model does not inorporate the evolution of temperature, we provide the formulas for

the saturation of the nonlinear tearing mode for both uniform and non uniform resistivity pro(cid:28)les. The

same formula for ∆′(wsat) was obtained in parallel by another group who applied the tehnique of Ref.
; ref.18 also provides expressions for ∆′(wsat) where the feedbak of the magneti

12 to higher order

18,19

island on the resistivity pro(cid:28)le is aounted for in the ase of a time independent thermal ondutivity.

This paper is organized as follows. In Se. II, we introdue the main equations and we speify the

di(cid:27)erent normalizations and notations adopted throughout the paper. The solutions of the (linearized)

outer equations are given in Se. III. We then takle the problem of the saturated tearing mode in the

nonlinear inner boundary layer (Se. IV), where the (cid:29)ux oordinate method, whih exploits the fat that

the urrent is a (cid:29)ux funtion is desribed (cid:28)rst (Se. IV B). We outline how the alulations an be arried

out onsistently to the leading signi(cid:28)ant order in the island width expansion. This provides a benhmark

for the more general perturbative approah, the main fous of this paper, whih is presented in Se. V.

Setion VI yields the modi(cid:28)ed Rutherford equation providing the whole nonlinear evolution of the island

width, as well as the (lowest order) modi(cid:28)ation of the equilibrium magneti (cid:29)ux funtion; it also provides

a brief disussion of the validity limits of our method. Finally, Se. VII is devoted to the onlusions.

the visosity and η is the resistivity. In the following, two models are onsidered: model A, in whih the

resistivity is uniform (η = ηA ), and model B, in whih it is not, but the eletri (cid:28)eld is (ηB(r)Jeq(r) = Ez ).

The equilibrium urrent pro(cid:28)le Jeq(r) then fully determines the plasma equilibrium whih we have further

assumed to be stati (ϕeq = 0).

B. Single heliity perturbation of the equilibrium

In the remainder of this paper, we work in ylindrial geometry and for now only onsider the saturation

of the single heliity (m, n) perturbation of the equilibrium, to reintrodue time dependene at the very

end of our alulations, whih, as we shall see, an be done very simply. Therefore, all quantities heneforth

depend on two variables only: r , and τ

It is easily seen that B.

ontrast, the helial (cid:29)ux funtion ψ∗ = ψ + Bznr2/2mR veri(cid:28)es B.
where h = ez + nr/mR eθ . We thus from now on work with ψ∗

This means that J = J(ψ∗), whih is the basis of the (cid:29)ux oordinate method. Equations (8), (9) and (10)

are the basis of the following analytial work.

Equations (8), (9) and (10) must be omplemented with boundary onditions. Cylindrial geometry

|r=0 = 0 (v⊥(r = 0) = 0) (11)
Furthermore, sine the plasma boundary is taken to be at r = 1, the normal veloity omponent should

to arry out the following alulations. Suitable boundary onditions are, for example, ∂τ ψ∗
in Ref. 11, or ∂τ ψ∗

|r=∞ = 0, as in Ref. 20.

|r=1 = 0, as

are onerned, they atually need not be spei(cid:28)ed expliitly

This ends the de(cid:28)nition of the di(cid:27)erential problem to be solved.

III. OUTER SOLUTION

A. Outer equation

As usual in tearing mode theory, we solve the di(cid:27)erential problem as a boundary layer problem by

mathing an outer and an inner solution, and we approximate the outer solution by the linear ideal one.

We set: ψ∗ = ψ∗

eq(r) + δ2ψ1F (r) cos(τ ) + o(δ2). Linearizing (10) yields:

ψ1F = 0

From now on, we assume that m

2, sine we use the "onstant-ψ" approximation whih does not work

≥

for the m = 1 mode. Equation (13) then has two regular singular points: one at r = 0 and the other
at r = rs , where ψ∗′
loation of the (m, n) rational surfae and, in the frame of the "onstant-ψ" approximation, we an hoose

eq(rs) = 0, or equivalently qeq(rs) = m/n, sine qeq = rǫ/(nrǫ/m

ψ∗′
eq). rs is the

−

ψ1F (rs) = 1 so that δ is the square root of the perturbation amplitude at r = rs . The indiial equation for
both points shows that, whenever the boundary onditions (11) are satis(cid:28)ed, ψ1F behaves like rm

around

r = 0, and has a logarithmi singularity at r = rs . This means that our perturbation expansion breaks

down near the rational surfae, whih eventually has to be resolved thanks to a boundary layer entered

upon it that we heneforth refer to as the "inner" region.

B.

Let ρ

The logarithmi term appearing in (15) implies that the perturbation expansion breaks down in a region

entered on the rational surfae. This omes from the fat that the quasilinear term in (10) beomes of

the same order as the linear one when ρ is su(cid:30)iently small. Indeed, it is easy to see that:

[ψeq, δ2J1F cos τ ] + [δ2ψ1F cos τ, Jeq] = O(δ2)

and [δ2ψ1F cos τ, δ2J1F cos τ ] = O(

where J1F cos τ =

∆(ψ1F cos τ ), and Eq. (17) immediately shows that the quasilinear term is no longer

Inner equations

Until otherwise stated, we now onsider model A (onstant resistivity) and will address model B later,

where only minor modi(cid:28)ations will our. We work in (ξ, τ ) variables. Mathing with the outer solution

As regards the inertia equation, some are is needed before simply re-writing equation (10) instead

of (7). Indeed, we (cid:28)rst have to ompare the order of magnitude, in the boundary layer, of the di(cid:27)erent

terms appearing in the latter equation before making any simpli(cid:28)ation. To do so, we need to have some

information on ϕ. This an very simply be done by writing ϕ = δ2ϕ1F (r) sin τ + o(δ2) and solving (8) to
order δ2

to show that the terms on the right hand side of (7) an be negleted if the following onditions hold:

, then, in the boundary layer (ρ

δ), ϕ = O(1). It is now straightforward

∼

The (cid:28)rst of these is basially that δ be greater than the resistive layer width, a fat already pointed out in

Ref. 9, and the seond one is that it be larger than the viso-resistive length. Provided (22) is satis(cid:28)ed,

the inertia equation an be written, in the inner domain, as in equation (10):

[ζ, J] = 0

In the following, we introdue two independent alulations of the nonlinear inner solution, whih

eventually has to be mathed to (18), using a perturbation expansion in δ . The (cid:28)rst one basially replaes

equation (23) with J(ξ, τ ) = j(ζ(ξ, τ )), i.e. it uses the fat that the urrent pro(cid:28)le is a (cid:29)ux funtion. We

only give a brief aount of it, sine it is an improvement of the tehnique desribed in Ref. 12, and gives

the same solutions as the seond one whih is new. The latter is indeed based on a lassial perturbation

expansion of all the involved funtions, and is more (cid:29)exible sine it works also for problems where J is

not a funtion of ψ .

In the (ξ, τ ) plane, the urves ζ(ξ, τ ) = constant either over the −
result, a given value of ζ may orrespond to several values of ξ for a given value of τ (at the maximum order

π interval or are losed. As a

≤

τ

of our alulations, there are only two values orresponding to the topology of a lassial magneti island).

Therefore, the hange of variable (24) is one to one only in loal domains. In suh domains, we an solve

ζ(ξ, τ ) = constant for ξ , whih yields ξ = X(ζ, τ ). Consequently, ϕ(ξ, τ ) beomes Φ(ζ, τ ) = ϕ(X(ζ, τ ), τ ).

A losed (cid:29)ux surfae is desribed by a series of funtions X(ζ, τ ) (two for the maximum order of our

alulations). These funtions enable the generalization of Eq. (26) to losed (cid:29)ux surfaes by interpreting

the integrals as loop integrals on a given (cid:29)ux surfae.

Equation (26) is the fundamental equation of the (cid:29)ux oordinate method. It was already derived in Ref.

12 for the ase of a given resistivity pro(cid:28)le (i.e. model B). The inner solution an be derived by ombining

it with a single di(cid:27)erential equation, Eq. (20), through the following iterative proedure. The (cid:28)rst step

sets δ = 0 in Eq. (26). This yields j0 = a0 , whih is set in Eq. (20) to provide ζ0i =

ξ2 + a(τ )ξ + b(τ )

b2|

|

where a(τ ) and b(τ ) are two unknown funtions whih are determined by mathing with the outer solution

(18). Sine the next order in the expansion of ζ provided by Eqs. (26) and (20) is δ , the mathing brings

to a(τ ) and b(τ ) terms of order 1 and δ ln δ . As a result, ζ0i = ζ0 + ςαδ ln δ ξ cos τ , where

(25)

(26)

(27)

ζ0 =

b2|

|

ξ2 + ς cos τ.

Then the leading orders X0i of X an be omputed by solving ζ = ζ0i(X0i(ζ, τ ), τ ) at orders 1 and δ ln δ
for X0i . This yields X0i(ζ, τ ) = X0 −

This ends the (cid:28)rst iteration of the alulation. We notie that two values of ξ are related to one value

of ζ at this level of approximation. The next iteration starts by setting X0i in Eq. (26), whih brings

orders δ and δ2 ln δ to j . These orders are brought into Eq. (20), whih brings ontributions of orders

δ and δ2 ln δ to ζ whih are ompletely de(cid:28)ned by mathing with the outer solution, and so on. The

exlusion of a small neighborhood of ξ = 0 is required at all orders. The alulation brings an expansion
of ∆′

in δ whih is provided in the next setion. We notie that eah step of the (cid:29)ux oordinate method

approximates Sζ by its expression given by the available approximation of X(ζ, τ ).

In order to make the omparison with the perturbative method easier, it is useful to notie that the

The (cid:29)ux oordinate method brings a series of simpli(cid:28)ations to that of Ref. 12: (i) no Ansatz is made

the same alulation to be formally done for (cid:29)ux surfaes inside and outside the magneti island, and

simpli(cid:28)es the alulation of (cid:29)ux surfae averages; this divides the neessary algebra by more than a fator

two; (iii) fewer quantities need to be de(cid:28)ned to proeed with the alulation.

V. PERTURBATIVE METHOD

A. Zeroth order

The method is simply based on equations (19), (20) and (23) along with the following natural ex-

pansions: ζ = ζ0 + δζ1 + δ2ζ2 + o(δ2), J = J0 + δJ1 + δ2J2 + o(δ2) and ϕ = ϕ0 + δϕ1 + o(δ), where a

quantitiy with index n has an order smaller than 1/δ and larger or equal to 1. From (19), we diretly

obtain J0 = a0 , whih, using (20) and mathing with (18), immediately yields (27). We reognize the

"onstant-ψ" approximation that is valid to lowest order.

In the rest of the alulation, it will prove most useful to work in (ζ0, τ ;

the sign of ξ . Let f (ξ, τ ) be any funtion of the old variables, then we should introdue

) variables where ± tells

±

ξ =

b2|

−1(ζ0 −

|

ς cos τ ).

Finally, we de(cid:28)ne Cx ontours as:

x ≡ {

where the (cid:28)rst line desribes open urves and the seond losed ones (from now on, we omit the ±

From (23), it an readily be seen that J1 = j1(ζ0 ;

). We note, already, that we use the same notation

±

IV B, sine it will be shown shortly that they do refer to the same

and integrating the equation above along Cζ0 , we immediately derive the following expression for j1 :

where H is the Heaviside funtion. We now make an important remark onerning j1 . Indeed, expression

(34) has a derivative singularity at ζ0 = 1, whih is not physially aeptable. As already mentioned in

Ref. 12, this problem an be resolved thanks to a thin boundary layer entered around the separatrix

ζ0(ξ, χ) = 1. However, ontrary to what is laimed in Ref. 12, it is not inertia but visosity that is

no longer negligible in equation (23) (see Appendix A). The urrent pro(cid:28)le ould thus, in priniple, be

regularized by solving the problem in this seondary viso-resistive boundary layer, using one again the

tehnique of mathed asymptoti expansions, a proedure similar to that already performed in Ref. 21 to

regularize Rutherford's solution

. Nevertheless, that treatment needs not be done expliitly for present

9

purposes. We therefore assume that j1 is regular from now on, although we always use expression (34) in

our alulations, whih makes sense as long as it does not lead to divergenes. Finally, using (34) together

with (20) provides ζ1 :

Before proeeding to the mathing with (18), we note that, given any funtion

possible to obtain its asymptoti expansions in one of two ways: either express it as an expliit funtion

Using (14) and the de(cid:28)nition of β , it is possible to show that the (cid:28)rst line of this equation mathes all

diverging terms of (18).

The last expression on the right hand side of (46) is the "onverging term" mentioned in (45). In order

for the mathing to be omplete, we have to selet its (cid:28)rst two Fourier omponents. We begin by the

This equation is the (cid:28)nal result of the mathing proedure and will be re-written in a more pleasant

form shortly. We see that (50) requires the knowledge of divergenes so as to substrat them from the

urrent pro(cid:28)le integral. Furthermore, heking that the diverging terms do math orretly with the outer

solution (18) gives on(cid:28)dene in the validity of the saturation ondition (51). Lastly, given (28), (29) and

14

the fat that X0(ζ, τ ;

) = ξ(ζ, τ ;

), it is easy to see that, setting ζ = ζ0 + δ ζ1 + O(δ2), a simple Taylor

±

±

expansion of (28) yields the same urrent pro(cid:28)le funtions Jn that were derived above. In partiular, the

jk 's introdued in Se. IV B and the ones derived in Se. V are indeed the same funtions, whih justi(cid:28)es

the use of the same notations, as was said previously. Therefore, the (cid:29)ux oordinate and perturbative

methods do provide the same result, as already laimed.

D. Non uniform resistivity

We now treat model B (non uniform resistivity) using the perturbative method (it is easy to derive

the equivalent of (26) for that model), and show that only slight di(cid:27)erenes our while solving the inner

equations. Of these, only Ohm's law is hanged into

(cid:11)
2 has the same asymptoti expansion as that given in (45)

(cid:14)(cid:10)

for j2 . Consequently, the only di(cid:27)erenes that we have to determine are those oming from equations (47)

and (50). Making use of (49), one easily shows that:

Therefore, ∂ξζ2 now has an asymptoti term of the form ∓

a1Ω/2b2a0 whih we annot ompensate with

orretion to the equilibrium magneti (cid:29)ux that we

mentioned earlier and whih we will deal with somewhat later. It is interesting to point out that suh a

term was forbidden in model A beause of urrent onservation during the relaxation (see Appendix C),

and our alulations are thus onsistent.

As to the (cid:28)rst Fourier harmoni, it an be shown to merely inlude a new term in (51) whose oe(cid:30)ient

an again be omputed numerially and is approximately equal to −

VI. RESULTS

A. Saturation equation

The mathing onditions that we have obtained for both models atually provide saturation equations

for the island width, whih is de(cid:28)ned as w

4δ/

≡

2

b2| (i.e.

|

it is the width of the separatrix of zeroth

order magneti surfaes as desribed by ζ0). We (cid:28)rst need to reintrodue time dependene so as to make
p
∂t(δ(t)2ζ) to the left hand

omparisons with previous results easier. Equation (19) is modi(cid:28)ed by adding −
side, whose lowest order term is 2δ ˙δ cos τ , whih hanges (34) into

Sine the new part added to j1 is even in ξ , it ontributes to the mathing with ∆′

this new term into aount and rewrite (51) with respet to w and for both models:

and omes from the omment made below (16) : Σ′

preisely depends on r0 in suh a way that the
ln w/r0 + Σ′/2 is atually normalization independent. It is therefore natural to de(cid:28)ne an

It is interesting to review past work in the light of this onsideration. First, one observes that the results

obtained in Refs. 11 and 14 do depend on length normalization. The work done in Ref. 12 is formally

normalization independent, sine a hange of normalization length indues a hange in the saturation

equation of order δ , higher than the order δ ln δ at whih the alulations were stopped. However, the

normalization issue strikes bak in any pratial appliation of the formula when an expliit value of δ must

be set in the logarithm. Finally, the equation given in Ref. 13 turns out to be normalization independent,

but laks important order δ terms and does not provide any result for the symmetri ase (i.e. A

= 0)

either.

We (cid:28)nally mention that all the alulations whih have been arried out so far an very easily be

modi(cid:28)ed so as to (cid:28)t the slab geometry ase already treated in Ref. 17. One simply has to apply the

following simpli(cid:28)ations:

a0 = 1 ,

b2 =

1/2 ,

−

m

, ψ∗

→

ψ ,

(61)

In partiular, (60) immediately allows us to reover the evolution equation derived in Ref. 17.

B. Modi(cid:28)ation of the equilibrium magneti (cid:29)ux

As pointed out when we derived the asymptoti behavior of the inner solution, there has to be an order

δ3

modi(cid:28)ation of the equilibrium magneti (cid:29)ux in the outer solution for the mathing proedure to be

omplete, whih is a result di(cid:27)erent from that obtained in Ref. 10, where it was found to be of order δ4
We therefore write ψ∗ = ψ∗
eq(r) + δ2ψ1F (r) cos(τ ) + δ3ψ0F (r) + o(δ3). From what we have done earlier, we

.

know the following onditions that ψ0F must satisfy:

lim
r→rs

ψ0F (r) =

±

2

Ω
b2|

λ

∓

2

a1
a0

Ω
b2|

|

and

(62)

We now have to derive an equation for ψ0F and we will see that our simple perturbation tehnique is

muh easier to implement than the one used in Ref. 10 whih is based on the J = J(ψ) property. Setting

ϕ = δ2ϕ1F (r) sin τ + δ3ϕ0F (r) + o(δ3), we see that equation (10) is trivially satis(cid:28)ed to order δ3
write (8) at that same order, whih merely gives ψ′′

0F /r = 0 and, onsequently:

0F + ψ′

and thus

ψ0F (r) = D + E ln r

(63)

17

For model A (onstant resistivity), it is lear that we simply have ψA

0F =

Ω/2

b2|, whih does not

|

±

violate the ondition desribed in Appendix C. Physially, it does not lead to any hange of the equilibrium

magneti (cid:28)eld but merely re(cid:29)ets the fat that the saturation of the magneti island leads to an inrease

of the (normalized) poloidal (cid:29)ux per unit length that, to lowest order, is equal to 2δ3Ω/2

b2|. Making use

|

of the normalizations (6) and integrating on the whole ylinder (cid:28)nally gives the total hange of poloidal

In the ase of model B, things are not so straightforward. Indeed, in order for (63) to math onditions

The problem is that suh a solution would not satisfy the boundary onditions of the problem given in (11)

and would atually be singular at r = 0. This means that the seond ondition in (62) is not aeptable.

That problem an be solved by setting C(τ ) = a1Ω/2b2a0 in (43), whih is perfetly allowed. ψB

This hange of order δ3

in the (cid:29)ux is a natural onsequene of J0 = a0 and of the expression (34) for

j1 . Indeed, they tell that, in the nonlinear regime, the urrent has a plateau inside the island. Sine the
width of the island is O(δ), this brings a hange O(J ′
eq(rs)δ3) to

eq(rs)δ2) to the magneti (cid:28)eld and O(J ′

C. Validity limits of the method

Sine we have used a perturbation expansion in δ , the (cid:28)rst ondition that should be met for our

alulations to be valid is obviously δ

1. For instane, in the ase when A

= 0 and B ≥

≪

0, equation

(60) would predit exponential growth of the island width. However, sine our result is no longer valid

when δ approahes unity, this does not neessarily mean that the system would lead to a disruption, for

there might be saturation with a large island.

The seond, more limiting ondition is that ∆′

However, this would not be allowed, beause of the singularity at r = rs , and our method would thus lead

This basi analysis is in good agreement with reent numerial results obtained by Loureiro et al.

for

the symmetri tearing mode in slab geometry. Indeed, sine, in that ase, the island width is simply given

by w = 4δ , the ondition ∆′δ/2
Ref. 22 (w∆′

8.2). When this ondition is met, Loureiro et al. observe the formation of urrent sheets,

whih, typially, means that the (cid:28)rst Fourier harmoni of the perturbation is no longer dominant with

respet to higher ones, whih ontradits the "onstant-ψ" approximation used in our approah.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have provided a rigorous solution to the simple tearing mode problem in ylindrial geometry using

both the (cid:29)ux oordinate method and a new perturbation tehnique, and our alulations an diretly be

transposed to the ase of a plasma slab. The (cid:28)nal evolution equation ontains all terms of order w and

has been expliitly shown to be normalization independent, a neessary physial requisite. We have also

shown that the saturation of the tearing mode leads to a modi(cid:28)ation of the equilibrium magneti (cid:29)ux

funtion whih we have been able to fully determine and whih is onsistent with the ondition of urrent

(cid:29)ux onservation in the ase of a uniform resistivity pro(cid:28)le. Lastly, we have disussed the limits of validity

of our approah and we have derived a qualitative ondition on ∆′

whih is in good agreement with the

reent numerial study arried out in Ref. 22.

Besides the atual results shown here, it is important to appreiate the importane of establishing solid

analyti tehniques for future work. In partiular, the perturbation method, whih does not rely on a

funtional dependene between the urrent and the (cid:29)ux funtion, is rather promising for the treatment of

more general models than onventional redued MHD. For instane, the fored tearing mode in rotating

plasmas is urrently being revisited and a (cid:28)rst appliation to the stati ase was given in Ref. 17. In the

longer term, two-(cid:29)uid models with diamagneti e(cid:27)ets should also be aessible to analyti investigations

with these tehniques.

APPENDIX A: VISCOUS BOUNDARY LAYER AROUND THE SEPARATRIX

We want to evaluate the (cid:28)rst negleted terms in (23) and derive their behavior around the separatrix

whih is automatially satis(cid:28)ed by the (cid:28)rst term on the right hand side of (A1).

We thus see that, if the magneti Prandtl number S/Re is of order unity, the main orretion is due to

visosity and we an neglet inertia. Integrating (A3) on Cζ0 then gives the following ondition:

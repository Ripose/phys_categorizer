Magnetic helicity is a topological characteristic of magnetic ﬁeld structures which includes the twist-

ing and the kinking of a ﬂux tube as well as the linkage between diﬀerent ﬂux tubes (Moﬀatt, 1978,

With the introduction of Euler potentials, the helicity can be calculated as an integral over the

surface bounded by this singular curve. A special programme for visualization is worked out.

the possibility to deﬁne the helicity for diﬀerence between the original ﬁeld and the vacuum ﬁeld

(Schindler et al., 1988; Biskamp, 1993; Priest and Forbes, 2000) which helps to give the helicity a

physical meaning for more realistic conditions. Nevertheless, we will restrict our consideration to the

classical case Bn

∂Ω = 0, leaving a more general deﬁnition of the magnetic helicity for future studies.

there is the following problem related to helicity. It can be easily veriﬁed that

(or A = α

β) is the vector potential (1.2) for the magnetic ﬁeld (1.4). Then helicity vanishes at

the level of the scalar product (A

B) = 0. It is known (see, for example, Biskamp, 1993) that the

vector potential can be presented in the following form (Clebsch representation)

·

where the function ψ (contrary to φ in (1.3)) must be multi-valued. This implies that the function

ψ has a surface Sj inside the volume Ω where it has a jump, then the contribution from the jump

surface Sj is added to the integral over ∂Ω in equation (1.3) which results in the nonzero helicity.

The solution to the questions how to introduce Euler potentials globally for the magnetic ﬁeld with

non-trivial helicity, how to ﬁnd the function ψ, and why it has to be multi-valued, are not clear so

far. For example, it is stated (Biskamp, 1993) that Euler potentials can not be introduced globally

for a magnetic ﬁeld with nonzero helicity unless the system is multiply connected. In (Sagdeev et

2

al., 1986) it is pointed out that magnetic ﬁeld lines determined by the Lagrangian invariants do not

admit any linkage, i.e.,the helicity has to vanish. The representation (1.5) is used sometimes (Priest

and Forbes, 1999; Wong, 2000) quite generally, but it is not mentioned that helicity has to vanish in

this case, hence the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld has to be relatively simple.

The aim of this paper is to show how one can practically introduce Euler potentials (1.4) as well

as the Clebsch representation (1.6) for a magnetic ﬁeld with nonzero helicity. There is a solution

of the MHD equations (Kamchatnov, 1982, Sagdeev et al., 1986) based on the Hopf invariant of
the mapping of a 3D sphere S3 into a 2D sphere S2 (see, for example, Dubrovin et al., 1979). In
this solution the magnetic ﬂux tubes can link each other as many times as one wants. The MHD

soliton has a known helicity following from topology, hence in each step of the calculation, there is

opportunity to control the situation. Besides, this solution is relatively simple, and all the results

can be obtained analytically. We will not use topological methods, because all our results can be

obtained straightforwardly if some topological information has been taken into account from the very

beginning.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Sections 2 and 3 we recall the details of the MHD

Kamchatnov-Hopf solution. Euler potentials are introduced in Section 4. A visualization of the

magnetic ﬁeld structure is presented in Section 5. Helicity coordinates are introduced in Section 6,

and Section 7 is devoted to the summary and discussion.

2 MHD Kamchatnov-Hopf soliton

First of all we will recall (Chandrasekhar, 1961; Kamchatnov, 1982) that any solinoidal vector ﬁeld,
divB = 0, gives rise to a solution of the steady-state MHD equations

in an incompressible plasma where the density ρ = const. Here P is the total (gas + magnetic)
pressure, v is the plasma velocity. If we choose v = B/√4πρ, and P = const, then equations (2.1 -

2.4) are satisﬁed automatically. In this solution the magnetic tension is balanced by the centrifugal

force.

The idea of the Kamchatnov-Hopf soliton solution is to obtain a solenoidal vector ﬁeld with known
linkage using topological methods. A 3D sphere S3 is deﬁned in R4 as a set of points (q1, q2, q3, q4)

such that q2
then S3 can be described also as

4 = 1. Let us introduce two complex numbers Z1 = q1 + iq2, Z2 = q3 + iq4,

2 = 1. A curve (a circle) on S3 can be presented as

l(t) = (Z1eiω1t, Z2eiω2t),

where t is a parameter along the curve. It can be shown (Dubrovin et al., 1979) that two curves

corresponding diﬀerent initial points Z1, Z2 with integer numbers ω1, ω2 link each other ω1ω2 times.

A tangential ﬁeld Y on S3 generated by the curve (2.5) is

Y(ω1, ω2) =

= (

ω1q2, ω1q1,

which also has the linkage ω1ω2. Now we can map the curve (2.5) into R3 using the stereographic

calculations convenience.

The ﬁeld (2.10) is the basis for the topological soliton. As was pointed out previously, if we

introduce the plasma velocity v = B/√4πρ, and the pressure P = const, then MHD equations (2.1 -

2.4) are satisﬁed automatically. We will refer to this solution as the MHD Kamchatnov-Hopf soliton.

Let us now derive the equation of the magnetic ﬁeld lines in R3. To this end we can solve diﬀerential
equations dr

from S3 to R3 with the help of stereograﬁc projection (Kamchatnov, 1982; Sagdeev et al., 1986)

and verify that equation (1.4) is satisﬁed, i.e., the α, β are indeed Euler potentials. The potential

α is a naked angle (i.e., an angle being not hidden under any trigonometric functions), which can

have a nonzero contribution after integration of its gradient along a closed contour. Therefore, it is

not surprising that ﬁrst of all, α is a multi-valued function, and secondly,

α has a singularity on

should have some principal disadvantage. If vector potential A is deﬁned by the diﬀerential equation
(1.2), then we have to conclude that A is indeed the vector potential of the magnetic ﬁeld B because

the equation (1.2) is satisﬁed. But besides the diﬀerential equation there is also an integral equation

(A

dl) =

(B

dS) = FB,

IL

where FB is the magnetic ﬂux through the surface S bounded by the contour L. Diﬀerential and

integral equations sometimes are not identical, and in our situation this is exactly the case. If we

choose any contour L which does not cross the disc bounded by the singular circle (3.5), then the
circulation of A along L gives exactly the magnetic ﬂux FB. However, if the contour encounters the
disc bounded by singular circle (3.5), then the circulation gets an additional contribution

(A

,

therefore, the integral equation (4.6) is not satisﬁed. The formal reason for the multi-valued

character of the circulation (4.7) lies in the singular behaviour of the latter at the circle (3.5), or due

to the fact that the function α (4.1) is a naked angle. Hence, we have to proceed with the Clebsch

representation (1.6), and to ﬁnd a function ψ to compensate the singularity in the potential (1.5). It

is clear that the function ψ has also to be a naked angle like the function α, and its gradient should

have a singularity at the circle (3.5)

(cid:27)

It has no singularity in the whole space like the magnetic ﬁeld (2.10), and both the diﬀerential

(1.2) and the integral (4.6) equations are now satisﬁed.

It is interesting to note that the Clebsch representation (1.6) formally looks similar to the gauge

condition A′
single-valued one for the gauge transformation at least for the simple connected region Ω, hence the

φ. Nevertheless there is an essential diﬀerence. The function φ has to be a

→

∇

integral of its gradient along any closed contour has to vanish. Contrary, the function ψ in the Clebsch

representation (1.6) has to be a multi-valued one, and the integral of its gradient along some closed

contour can have nonzero contribution. Generally speaking, the question whether the gauge function

is a multi or single valued one is not really important for many applications in electrodynamics. But

for such a delicate characteristics of the ﬁeld as the magnetic helicity, the solution of this question

plays the key role. It is the multi-valued function ψ which does the nonzero helicity.

Using the vector potential (4.9) and the magnetic ﬁeld (2.10), we can calculate the helicity as the

The negative sign in (4.10) is connected with the parameter t in the initial curve (2.5) at S3, so

that eiωt gives a minus, whereas e−iωt gives a plus.

The Clebsch representation (1.6) leads to another way to compute the helicity

which, of course gives the same result (4.10). Here S is the singular circle (3.5), and

jump of the function ψ on the latter. As one can see, helicity can be calculated from the surface

integral (4.11) rather than from the volume integral (1.1), which is simpler to do. It is also interesting

that the helicity is equal to the magnetic ﬂux through the singular circle times the jump of the ψ

5 Visualization

It is worthwhile to present pictures of the magnetic ﬁeld structure of the MHD Kamchatnov-Hopf

soliton solution as mathematical examples for illustration.

We start with the simplest case, ω1 = ω2 = 1 . The ﬂux tube looks like a torus twisted by the
angle 360o. To see this more clearly, the tube presented is chosen to have a rectangular cross section

(Figure 1) so that one can easily follow the screwed color boundaries.

The surface Euler potential β = const is just a usual torus (Figure 2), it stays more or less the

same for all ω1, ω2. The magnetic ﬁeld lines are swept around this torus.

The surface α = const is more complicated (Figure 3). It is similar to a ribbon twisted by 360o.
Such a surface can not be continued to the closed one in R3 without self crossing which is because

α has a singularity at the circle (3.5).

∇

There is a simple way to imagine the magnetic ﬁeld structure. Let us take a paper ribbon, twist
it by the angle 360o (note that twisting by 180o gives a Moebius sheet), glue the edges of the ribbon

together, and then cut it along the central line with scissors. As a result, we get two ribbons linked

to each other. If we continue this procedure and cut the two ribbons obtained along their central

8

axis, and so on, we can observe that each ribbon links any other one exactly one time (Figure 4).

This behaviour is reﬂected in the topological invariant helicity K (4.10).

It is diﬃcult to imagine that the intersection of two surfaces α = const and β = const for diﬀerent

constants can give linked lines, nevertheless, it is so.

To complete the case ω1 = ω2 = 1, we present also the surface ψ = const (Figure 5) which has a

spiral structure converging to the singular circle (3.5).

After these relatively simple pictures we can proceed to the general case. First we recall that

two numbers are relatively prime, if and only if the greatest common divisor of the numbers, is

one. For integers ω1, ω2 such that ω1 = n, ω2 = m are relative prime, the magnetic ﬁeld lines of the

MHD Kamchatnov-Hopf soliton are linked into (n, m) knots which are topologically nonequivalent

for diﬀerent (n, m). They form the known family of toric nodes (Crowell and Fox, 1963).

The case ω1 = 2, ω2 = 1 is depicted in Figure 6 (single ﬂux tube), Figure 7 (surface α = const),

and Figure 8 (knot (2,1) ). The more complicated case ω1 = 2, ω2 = 3 is presented in Figure 9 (single

ﬂux tube), Figure 10 (surface α = const), Figure 11 (central fragment of the surface α = const), and

Figure 12 (knot (2,3) ).

It is interesting that the surface of the Euler potential α = const for the latter case (Figures 10,

11) is similar to a propeller, and this circumstance seems not to be a pure coincidence. The propeller

has to create curls of air for producing a moving force, and at least some surfaces α = const (Figures

3, 7, 10) might be used for this aim just from topological reasons. Of course there is the question

about the eﬃciency of such airscrews or waterscrews, but this is not a subject of this paper.

6 Helicity coordinates

A magnetic ﬁeld line is deﬁned by two Euler potentials α, β, and a point on this line is controlled by

the parameter t. We can use another parameter ψ along the magnetic ﬁeld line instead of t. Then

α, β, ψ, i.e., all functions taking part in the Clebsch representation of the vector potential (1.6), can

be used as new curvilinear coordinates which have some useful property.

We already have an expression for the Clebsch coordinates via Cartesian coordinates (4.1, 4.2,

4.8). It is possible to simplify these equations noting that without loss of generality, we can assume

α1 = 0 in (4.1) and then obtain

One can see that the space R3 is mapped onto the parallelepiped (6.6) in which the straight lines
(α = const, β = const) represent the magnetic ﬁeld lines. It is surprising that all the complicated

magnetic structure is converted into a very simple geometrical object, that is the parallelepiped (6.6).

In fact, the situation is not that simple. To make ﬁeld lines which are closed, we have to glue the

end points. The points on the left boundary α =

π have to be considered identical with those on

the right boundary α = π, and the points of the bottom boundary ψ =
those on the upper boundary ψ = 1

We note that helicity coordinates can be particularly important for numerical simulations where

7 Discussion and summary

It was shown that Euler potentials can be introduced globally for a magnetic ﬁeld with nonzero
helicity even for the simply-connected region (the space R3 in our case), contrary to the remark of
Biskamp (1993). Therefore most of the coordinate systems (Pudovkin and Semenov, 1985; Pustovi-

tov, 1999) based on Euler potentials (1.4), such as the helicity system (6.2) can still be applied also

to magnetic structures with nonzero helicity K

= 0. On the other hand, one has to be particularly

careful with the vector potential. Remember that the simple representation (1.5) is not appropriate

for the magnetic ﬁeld with K

= 0, instead the Clebsch representation (1.6) has to be used.

As we saw, the function ψ plays a key role in calculating the magnetic helicity. The multi-valued

character of this function is connected with the singular behaviour of the gradient of at least one

Euler potential (α in our case). In its turn, the singularity of the Euler potential is the consequence

of the fact that the α = const surface is highly twisted for the case K
to a closed surface in R3.

= 0 and cannot be continued

The helicity turns out to be equal to the magnetic ﬂux through the singular circle times the jump

of the function ψ, hence, the calculation of K can be reduced to a surface integral.It seems that the

simple formula (4.11) can be extended to the general case as

K =

ψj

FBj,

Xj {

}

(7.1)

where FBj is the magnetic ﬂux through the surface bounded by j-singular curve of the Euler

potential and

is the jump of the function ψ at this surface.

ψj

{

}

If by chance it is known that all singular lines of the Euler potentials lie on a surface S (the

surface of the Sun, for example) then the magnetic helicity can be found using only data of the

11

normal component of the magnetic ﬁeld Bn on S from the equations (4.11 or 7.1) which is an

important problem for solar physics. But if a singular line is inside the Sun, it is not possible to ﬁnd

the helicity using surface data. The maximum of what can be done is to estimate the helicity if one

could somehow control the magnetic ﬂux closed under the Sun’s surface.

The Kamchatnov-Hopf solution seems to be the simplest one which can describe the magnetic

ﬁeld with such a non-trivial helicity. Therefore it may play the same role for the investigation of

diﬀerent helicity problems as the Harris (1963) layer in plasma physics or the Petschek(1964) solution

in reconnection theory.

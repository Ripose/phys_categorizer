Abstract

We have obtained the solutions of linearized Shr¨odinger equation for spher-
ically and axially symmetrical electrons density oscillations in plasma in the
approximation of the self-consistent ﬁeld. It was shown that in the center or
on the axis of symmetry of such a system the static density of electrons can
enhance, which leads to the increasing of density and pressure of ion gas. We
suggest that this mechanism could be realized in nature as rare phenomenon
called the ’ﬁreball’ and could be used in carrying out the research concerning
operated thermonuclear synthesis.

If a volume charge appears in electroneutral plasma, i.e. electrons density
increases or decreases in some ﬁnite area, then, after an external inﬂuence
is over, the oscillating process consisting in periodical changes of the sign of
the considered volume charge is known to appear. It is necessary to remind
that the frequency of this process ωp called plasma frequency is related to
free electrons density in the plasma n0 by the formula

ω2

p =

4πe2n0
m

,

(1)

where e and m are the charge and the mass of the electron.

We will assume electrons in plasma to be a quantum many body system.
Such an assumption is due to the fact that, as it will be shown below, the solu-
tions obtained have characteristic sizes of atomic order. It is known that the
classical dynamics of N interacting particles can be represented by the system
of diﬀerential equations of motion in conﬁguration space of 3N-dimensions,

or in 6N-dimensional phase space, as well as by the system of partial dif-
ferential equations in three-dimensional physical space and as the dynamics
of singular material ﬁelds [1–3]. The transfer to the quantum-mechanical
description is realized by changing the dynamic functions to Hermitian oper-
ators. In this case the dimensionality of the conﬁguration space is conserved
and the state of the system is completely deﬁned by the wave functions in
the 3N-dimensional space.

Shr¨odinger equation as it was shown in ref. [3,4], could be presented in the
form of the system of equations in physical space and having the same form
as the equations of hydrodynamics. In these works the quantum-mechanical
system of N particles with arbitrary masses and charges, interacting between
itself by Coulomb forces and with external classical electromagnetic ﬁeld
characterized by vector ~A and scalar ϕ potentials has been considered.

In this approach the complex Ψ function introduced in three-dimensional

space has the following form

Ψ (~r, t) =

ne (~r, t)e

where |Ψ|2 = ne(~r, t) is the density of electrons and Ψ function satisﬁes the
partial diﬀerential equation:

In the eq.(4) the ﬁrst two terms are the components of one electron Hamil-
tonian in the external electromagnetic ﬁeld, the third term represents the
potential energy of the electron in the self-consistent electrostatic ﬁeld cre-
ated by the whole electron system, with density of number of particles being
equal to |Ψ|2. The function θ (~r, t) describing exchange interactions between
electrons has the following form

where pe (~r, t) is the pressure of electron gas, q2 (~r, ~r′, t) is the correlation
function.

Therefore, in order to resolve exactly the considered problem one should
take into account all terms in the eq.(5). However, we will assume that the
contribution of exchange interactions to the dynamics of free electrons in
plasma is much smaller than that of the potential of self-consistent electro-
static ﬁeld. Then, in describing the dynamics of electron gas we will neglect
the function θ (~r, t). As it will be seen from further speculations, this rough
approximation allows us to get some consequences which are close to those
obtained from the consideration of the similar problem within the classical
approach.

Let us consider the neutral plasma, formed by the singly ionized gas, with
the energy of electrons being more than the potential of ionization of this gas.
We will suppose that this plasma possesses a spherical symmetry for density
and velocities distribution of the electron and the ion gases. Taking into
account the small mobility of heavy ions in gas compared to that of electrons
we will suppose that the density of ions is the constant value ni (~r, t) = n0.
We will also consider that in our case there are no external electromagnetic
ﬁelds except those of positively charged ions. It is worth mentioning that the
magnetic ﬁeld in the system is equal to zero. The potential of self-consistent
ﬁeld created by the density of electron gas is represented by the formula
(using spherical coordinates):

Ue = e

d3rG(~r′ − ~r)|Ψ|2 = 4πe

Supposing that |Ψ0|2 = n0 and |χ| ≪ |Ψo|, we get |Ψ0|2 = n0 +Ψ0f +|χ|2,
where f = χe−iωt + χ∗eiωt. Taking into account that |χ| ≪ |Ψo|, we obtain
|Ψ0|2 ≈ n0 + Ψ0f .

Then, we substitute eq.(10) and approximate expression for |Ψ0|2 in
eq.(8). Having considered the complex-conjugate equation together with the
obtained one, it was easy to get:

¯hωf +

∆f − 4πe2Ψ0 (2Ψ0 + f ) F (f ) = 0.

(11)

For the total linearization, it is necessary to suppose that 2Ψ0 + f ∼=
2Ψ0 in the third term of the equation involved. Then, we represent the
function χ through its real and imaginary parts: χ = χ1 + iχ2. Hence
f = χ1 cos ωt + χ2 sin ωt, and eq.(8) can be divided into two independent
similar equations for χ1 and χ2:

¯hωχn +

∆χn − 8πe2n0F (χn) = 0, n = 1, 2.

One can ﬁnd out the functions χn = Bn

where ωp is determined in eq.(1). The positive part of the dependence of γ
on the frequency ω is presented in the ﬁg.(1). It is worth noticing that if

4

the values of Bn are limited, the expressions for χn satisﬁes the condition of
system electroneutrality (9).

From the expression (13) one can see that the frequency ω = 2ωp is the
critical value, since for frequencies less than 2ωp, γ becomes a complex value
and under these circumstances the oscillations of the electron gas are absent.
It is necessary to remind that in using the classical approach to the similar
problem one gets the value ω = ωp for the critical frequency.

It is necessary to remind that the exact expression for the density of
electron gas in searching for the solution in the form of the eq.(10) is presented
as |Ψ0|2 = n0+Ψ0f +|χ|2. Let us deﬁne in this expression Ψ0f and ¯ne = |χ|2+
n0 as the dynamic and static components of density respectively. In deriving
the approximate linearized equation (12) the function |χ|2 was supposed to
be small and thus neglected. This procedure is not correct because the
integral F
is divergent. However, we
assumed that the density of ion gas was constant throughout the volume
because of the small mobility of heavy ions. This assumption is valid for
the frequently oscillating dynamic component, but |χ|2 does not depend on
time. Therefore, it is naturally to expect that under some conditions the
negative volume charge, described by this function, will be compensated (or
neutralized) by removing positive ions, that will result in local changing of
density and pressure of the ion gas.

Indeed, it can be shown that for our case the condition of static stability

where k is Boltsman constant, T is the ion gas temperature, ni is the ions
density, ¯ne is the static electrons density.

We demand that the ions density is equal to static electrons density with
high level of accuracy ni ≈ ¯ne = n0 + B2 sin2 γr
. Then, from eq.(14) we get
r2
≪ 1. Having substituted the expression
the following inequality:
for ni in the last formula, we obtained the condition of the neutralization:
kT B2γ
4πe2n0 ≪ 1. Taking into account that ions density in the center of the system
should be equal to nc = B2γ2, this condition can be rewritten in the following
way:

For instance, for T = 10000K and the value γ = 2.3 · 107cm−1 which was
obtained above we get nc ≪ 500n0. In deriving the solution of our problem
we assumed that nc ≪ n0. Thus, we can conclude that, if the condition (15)
is satisﬁed, the ion charge is undoubtedly compensated by the supplementary
static electron charge and the divergence in the integral F (|Ψ|2 − ni) can be
eliminated.

Hence, the approximate, linearized theory trends to describe the pressure
enhancement of the ion gas in the center of symmetrically oscillating electron
gas.

It is worth mentioning that along with spherically symmetrical solution
of the eq.(12), there is at least one axially-symmetrical one which has the
form:

Ψ = n1/2

0 + BJ0(γr)e−iωt,

∞

where J0 is the zero-order Bessel function. In this case the dispersion relation
takes the same form as eq.(13). All consequences obtained for spherically-
symmetrical oscillations are valid and for this case too.

While considering nonlinear Shr¨odinger equation (8), it can be seen that
along with the components of frequency ω, the terms which do not depend
on time as well as on frequencies 2ω, 3ω and etc. appear. One can make
sure of this representing the solution of the eq.(8) in the form: Ψ(r, t) =

Ψ0 +

Ψk(r, t), where Ψ1 = B1e−iωt sin γr

.

We put forward the hypothesis that in this case the static density of
electron gas can attain great values. Density and pressure of ion gas are also
great in the center of such systems. Thus, along with the heating of the
central area resulted from intensive movement of electrons, there will be a
possible running of nuclear fusion reactions of corresponding nuclei in gas.

This process seems to support the existence of the enigmatic natural
phenomena, known as ’ﬁreball’.
If vapors of water which are present in
atmosphere contain deuterium in the amount of ≈ 1/5000 under normal
conditions, the running the nuclear fusion reactions will release the energy,
which support the oscillations of electron gas and prevent the recombination
of plasma. Taking into account small sizes of the central (active) regions and
small amount of deuterium in atmosphere, it is possible to use the term ’mi-
crodose’ thermonuclear reaction for process in question. Axially-symmetrical
oscillation of the electron gas is likely to appear as very seldom observed type
of a ’ﬁreball’ in the form of shining, sometimes closed cord [7]. Uncompli-

cated calculation shows that energy released in deuterium nuclei fusion in
1dm3 of vapors of water (the average size of a ’ﬁreball’) has the value of
about 1MJ, that corresponds to evaluations of energy released by some ob-
served ’ﬁreballs’ [7, 8].

Groups and separate researchers developing the problem of the operated
thermonuclear synthesis are suggested to pay attention to self-consistent,
radially and axially oscillating electron plasmoids as a base models to self-
supported thermonuclear reactions. The authors of the present article have
certain experience in generating ball-like plasma structures which proves the
correctness of the chosen model.

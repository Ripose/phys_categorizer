The turbulent transport of minority species/impurities is investigated in 2D
drift-wave turbulence as well as in 3D toroidal drift-Alfvén edge turbulence. The
full effects of perpendicular and – in 3D – parallel advection are kept for the
impurity species. Anomalous pinch effects are recovered and explained in terms
of Turbulent EquiPartition (TEP)

1 Anomalous Pinch in 2D Drift-Wave Turbulence

the inﬂuence of inertia, which enters via the polarization drift. The latter makes
the ﬂow compressible, consequently for ideal (massless) impurities, z = 0 and
advection is due to the incompressible electric drift only. In all cases the impurity
density is assumed to be so low compared to the bulk plasma density that there is
no back-reaction on the bulk plasma dynamics.

If the diffusivity µq
measured relative to a constant impurity background q 0 do not exceed a corre-
sponding level, the quantity ln q − z
is approximately a Lagrangian invariant.
Turbulent mixing will homogenize Lagrangian invariants in TEP states [2, 3],
leading to

ln q − z

w ≈ const,

which constitutes a prediction about the effect of compressibility on the initially
homogeneous impurity density ﬁeld. The conservation of impurity density yields

which conforms with the assumed ordering. We thus predict a linear relation be-
tween impurity density q and vorticity w
, the proportionality constant being the
mass–charge ratio z . This is related, but not the same as, to the aggregation of
dense particles in vortices in ﬂuids due to the Coriolis force [4]. The predic-
tion is veriﬁed by numerical simulations of inertial impurities in saturated HW-
turbulence for C = 1. The simulations are performed on a [−20, 20]2 domain,

1.2 Anomalous pinch

The role of inertia for a radially inward pinch is investigated by considering the
collective drift of impurities. Ideal impurities do on average not experience a drift,
but this is not the case for inertial impurities, since compressibility effects arrange
for a correlation between q 1 and w
. Note that only the deviations from the above
discussed linear relationship q = 1 + Kw

result in a net ﬂow, as

R

The evolution of the radial drift velocity, measured as the net radial impurity
transport, is presented in Figure 3. The radial drift velocity has a deﬁnite sign that
depends on the sign of z . There is a continuous ﬂow of impurities in a deﬁnite di-
rection (inward for positively charged impurities). This resembles the anomalous
pinch observed in magnetic conﬁnement experiments [5]. Average radial drift ve-
locities computed using the values of the drift from t = 25 to t = 150 are presented
in Table 1. The scaling of the average radial drift with z
is seen to be remarkably
linear.

2 Drift-Alfvén Turbulence

We now consider drift-Alfvén turbulence in ﬂux tube geometry [6, 7, 8]. The
following equations for the ﬂuctuations in density n, potential f with associated
vorticity w = (cid:209) 2

Standard parameters for simulation runs were

and w B = 0.05, with µw = µn = 0.025, corresponding to typical edge parameters
of large fusion devices. Simulations were performed on a grid with 128×512×32
points and dimensions 64 × 256 × 2p
in x, y, s corresponding to a typical approx-
imate dimensional size of 2.5 cm × 10 cm× 30 m [6]. Here we present results
from a low ˆb = 0.1 run with C = 11.5. In Figure 4 the dynamical evolution of the
impurity density is exempliﬁed in a plot showing the poloidal projection of the
impurity density.

mension not to scale). Initial distribution (left) and after 25 time units (right).

The ﬂux G of the impurity ion species can in lowest order be expressed by the
standard parameters used in modeling and in evaluation of transport experiments:
a diffusion coefﬁcient D and a velocity V , which is associated to a pinch effect,

G y(s) = −D(s)¶ x hq iy +V (s) hq iy .

(6)
From scatter plots of G (r)/ hniy versus ¶ x ln hniy, values for D(s) and V (s) are
obtained. The poloidal (coordinate s) dependence of D and V is rather strong and
shown, with numerical uncertainties, in Fig. 5. The effective advective velocity
V (s) changes sign and is at the high ﬁeld side directed outwards. This pinching
velocity is due to curvature and can be consistently explained in the framework
of Turbulent EquiPartition (TEP) [9, 3] as follows: In the absence of parallel
advection, ﬁnite mass effects and diffusion, Eq. (5) has the following approximate
Lagrangian invariant

L(s) = ln q + w Bx cos(s) − w By sin(s) .

TEP assumes the spatial homogenization of L by the turbulence. As parallel
transport is weak, each drift plane s = const. homogenizes independently. This
leads to proﬁles hL(s)iy = const.(s). At the outboard midplane (s = 0) the im-
purites are effectively advected radially inward leading to an impurity proﬁle
const. − w Bx), while at the high ﬁeld side they are effectively advected
(hln q iy
outward (hln q iy
const. + w Bx). One should note that this effective inward or
outward advection is not found as an average E × B velocity, but is mitigated by
the effect of spatial homogenization of L under the action of the turbulence. The
strength of the “pinch” effect is consequently proportional to the mixing properties
of the turbulence and scales with the measured effective turbulent diffusivity. We
arrive at the following expression for the connection between pinch and diffusion:

(s) with error-bars. The pinch velocity is compared to w b ∗ cos(s) ∗ D(s) (dashed
line).

Considering a stationary case with zero ﬂux and Eq. (7) we obtain a = 1. The bal-
looning in the turbulence level causes the inward ﬂow on the outboard midplane
to be stronger than the effective outﬂow on the high-ﬁeld side. Therefore, aver-
aged over a ﬂux surface and assuming a poloidally constant impurity density, a net
impurity inﬂow results. This net pinch is proportional to the diffusion coefﬁcient
D in agreement with experimental observations [10].

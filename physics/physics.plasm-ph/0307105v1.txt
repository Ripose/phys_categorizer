Abstract

In the above entitled recent publication by Giovanni Lapenta [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 90, 135005 (2003) ] it is claimed construction of a new class of soliton-
like solutions for the Grad-Shafranov equation in plane geometry. It is proved
here that, because of the mathematically erroneous choice ∇p = |Ψ|2Ψ∇Ψ for
an analytic continuation of the poloidal magnetic ﬂux-function Ψ in the com-
plex plane (p is the pressure), the cubic Schr¨odinger equation considered by
the author is irrelevant to the equilibrium problem and the Grad-Shafranov
equation.

In a recent publication [1], the author claims derivation of a new class
of solitonlike solutions for the Grad-Shafranov equation in plane geometry.
The equilibrium equations considered are (Eqs. (5) [1])

(∇Ψ × ∇Bz) · ˆz = 0
∇p + ∇2Ψ∇Ψ + Bz∇Bz = 0,

where p(Ψ) and Bz(Ψ) are the pressure and the z- component of the magnetic
ﬁeld, respectively. The following forms of the free functions p and Bz are then
chosen (Eq. (13) [1])

Bz∇Bz = α2
∇p = α2

0Ψ∇Ψ
0|Ψ|2Ψ∇Ψ,

and (1) is extended in the complex plane, thus leading to the cubic Schr¨odinger
equation (Eq. (14) [1])

∂2Ψ
∂x2 +

∂2Ψ
∂y2 = −α2

0(1 + |Ψ|2)Ψ.

A solitonlike solution of (4) is (Eq. (15) [1])

Ψ(x, y) = Ψpsech(x/L)e−j(α0+1/2α0y2

0)y.

For a complex function Ψ, however, the rhs of (3) becomes a non holo-
morphic function, i.e. owing to the fact that |Ψ| does not have derivative, the
term α2
0|Ψ|2Ψ∇Ψ can not be a function gradient as the lhs of (3) requires.
An explicit proof follows. Taking the curl of (3) yields ∇|Ψ| × ∇Ψ = 0,
implying that Ψ depends only on |Ψ|:

In order that the complex function Ψ be analytic, on account of (6) and
the Cauchy-Riemann conditions leads to |Ψ| = constant and therefore Ψ =
constant. Also, even without requiring analyticity of Ψ, by only considering
its polar form, Ψ = |Ψ| exp(jΘ(x, y)), Eq. (6) implies that

Ψ = f (|Ψ|).

Θ = Θ(|Ψ|).

Solution (5), however, is inconsistent with (7) (otherwise it should hold that
x = x(y)). Therefore, (4) is irrelevant to the Grad-Shafranov equation; as a
matter of fact the real part of (5),

u(x, y) = Ψpsech(x/L) cos h(α0 + 1/2α0y2

0)yi ,

A mathematically legitimate choice for ∇p, instead of (3), could be

∂2u
∂x2 +

∂2u
∂y2 = −α2

0(1 + u2)u.

∇p = α2

0Ψ3∇Ψ.

This leads to an equation of the form (8) for Ψ. Solving this equation in the
complex plane, however, is a task not easier than that for real Ψ.

In conclusion, because of the mathematically erroneous choice (3) for an
analytic continuation of Ψ, the cubic Schroedinger equation (4) considered
by the author is irrelevant to the equilibrium problem (1) and to the Grad-
Shafranov equation. Despite this unlucky situation we consider the idea of
the author as appealing, and hope that it will be successful in the future if
used in an appropriate setting.

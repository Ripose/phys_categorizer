Abstract

We develop an analytical formalism to determine the statistical
properties of a system consisting of an ensemble of vortices with ran-
dom position in plane interacting with a turbulent ﬁeld. We calcu-
late the generating functional by path-integral methods. The function
space is the statistical ensemble composed of two parts, the ﬁrst one
representing the vortices inﬂuenced by the turbulence and the second
one the turbulent ﬁeld scattered by the randomly placed vortices.

1 Introduction

This work presents a study of the statistical properties of a system of vortices
interacting with random waves.

The objective is to describe quantitatively the statistics of a turbulent
plasma in the regime where structures are generated at random, persist for
a certain time and are destroyed by perturbations. This regime is supposed
to be reached at stationarity in drift wave turbulence when there is a com-
petition between diﬀerent space scales. These scales range from the radially
extended eddies of the ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven modes to the
intermediate √Lnρs interval where the scalar nonlinearity is dominant over
the vectorial one and with random fast decays to few ρs scales where robust
vortex-like structures are generated. In a physical model the description of
these states requires to consider simultaneously the long time response and
the much faster spectral trapping in small vortices, condensed from events
of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of locally ordered sheared ﬂow. As a theo-
retical problem it seems almost intractable. In a pragmatic perspective we
adopt several approximations of this physical picture and develop a purely

2

analytical treatment for the characterization of the statistical properties. In
this complicated problem we hope that our work provides a contribution to
the theoretical description of structures in turbulent ﬂuids and plasmas.

The analytical model we propose here is essentially nonperturbative in the
sense that the structures are fully represented and we take into account their
particular analytical expression (or a reasonable approximation). It is in the
spirit of the semiclassical methods, impressively successful in ﬁeld theory.

In this sense this treatment presents substantial diﬀerences compared
with the more usual approaches, aiming in general to obtain a renormaliza-
tion of the linear response. When structures are present in the plasma any
perturbative approach is ineﬃcient, because it can only go not too far beyond
Gaussian statistics, i.e. calculate few cumulants beyond the second one. The
problem consists of the fact that they take as the base-point for developing
perturbative expansions the state of equilibrium of the plasma or a Gaussian
ensemble of waves. Or, from this point it is impossible to reach the strongly
correlated states of coherent structures. The idea of semiclassical methods is
precisely to place the equilibrium state on the structures and then to advance
in the space of conﬁgurations, to include random waves. This is the approach
we will adopt in the present work.

1.1 The formulation of the problem

A turbulent plasma where structures are formed is represented in the elec-
trostatic regime by an unique scalar ﬁeld. A ﬁrst approximation is to break
up this ﬁeld in two distinct elements : vortices and random waves. We will
suppose that there is a ﬁnite number N of vortices in a two-dimensional
plasma and that these vortices have random position. They interact with
a background of turbulence. Both the structures and the turbulent back-
ground are solutions of the same diﬀerential equation, derived from the drift
wave equations by a multiple space and time scale analysis and at statistical
stationarity, which is assumed to correspond to late time regimes.

The vortices are individually aﬀected by the turbulent background.
The turbulent background is aﬀected by the presence of the structures
at random positions. In addition the turbulent background has a statistics
which is strongly inﬂuenced by the nonlinear nature of the waves interactions,
even at amplitudes below those necessary to condense vortices. Random
growth and decay of modes at marginal stability is included as a drive with
Gaussian statistics.

Consider the ﬁeld φV ortices

φV of the discrete set of N vortices individ-

≡

ϕ (x, y) =

and we want to determine the statistical properties of the ﬁeld ϕ (x, y). We
will construct an action functional and we will calculate the generating func-
tional of the irreducible correlations (cumulants) of the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld ϕ.
The action functional is expressed in terms of the ﬁeld ϕ which we see as
composed from vortices and turbulence, Eq.(2). For example, the two-point
correlation is composed of four terms

Our procedure consists in absorbing the two intermediate terms into the ﬁrst
and the last terms. This is done by calculating the auto-correlations of each
component taking into account the presence of the other. In this operation
the second and the third terms, although are identical in Eq.(3) are regarded
the second term is seen as the contribution of the turbulent
diﬀerently:
background to the auto-correlation of a gas of vortices and the third term
is seen as the contribution of a set of vortices to the auto-correlations of a
turbulent ﬁeld.

(cid:11)

Therefore we consider that the action functional is composed of two dis-

tinct parts:

(1)

(2)

(4)

(5)

SV ϕ ≡

the action for the system of vortices
interacting with the random ﬁeld

SϕV ≡

the action for the random ﬁeld
interacting with the vortices

4

Then the statistical ensemble of realizations of the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld ϕ (x, y)
will actually consists of the Cartesian product of two distinct parts. The
generating functional will be

Z = ZV ϕZϕV

(6)

where each factor is calculated using the action deﬁned above. Although
the generating functional is factorized, which corresponds to splitting the
statistical ensemble into two parts, these two parts are not independent since
each will be calculated such as to include the eﬀect of the ﬁeld from the other
subsystem.

The interaction with an external current must be included in each of the
action expressions, Eqs.(4) and (5) in order to calculate the correlations using
functional derivatives. In an full treatment the current is introduced by a
term in Lagrangean

where ϕ is the total ﬁeld, vortices plus random waves. When we separate
the two components we have

Jϕ

ϕ = φV ortices + φwaves

Jϕ = JφV ortices + Jφwaves
This expression must be inserted in the action functional for the full system,
before the intermediate terms in Eq.(3) are absorbed into the ﬁrst and the
last. This means that the same current J will ﬁgurate in the ﬁnal expressions
of the two generating functionals Eq.(6)

(9)

Z [J] = ZV ϕ [J] ZϕV [J]

It will be shown below that the value of the ﬁeld at a particular point can
be obtained by functional derivation at the current at that point

The two-point correlation is obtained from the generating functional by ap-
plying two times this functional derivative, with the current in two distinct
points and taking ﬁnally the current to zero.

We now explain how this will be done eﬀectively.

1.2 Outline of the present analytical approach

1.2.1 Gas of vortices in the turbulent background

In the case of the vortices interacting with random waves, the basic reasoning
takes into consideration two distinct elements.

The ﬁrst is concerned with the statistical properties of a collection of
discrete vortices with zero, or very short, range of interaction. At this stage
of the problem the particular shape of the potential distribution in a vortex
is not essential and will be simpliﬁed in those situations where only the
positions of the centers are important. The statistical ensemble consists of
the conﬁgurations of randomly placed vortices, seen as a dilute gas.

The second aspect is concerned with the interaction between one (generic)
vortex and the random waves in the surrounding turbulence and calculates
the eﬀect on the form of the potential of the vortex. Instead of the exact
solution we will have now a form resulting from the scattering due to the
random perturbation produced by the turbulent background.

The statistical properties result from the combination of the two elements,

which will now be explained brieﬂy.

The ﬁrst problem is very similar to the Coulomb gas in two dimensions
or to any problem related to dilute gas of interacting particles. The partition
function is calculated using the sum of the energy of the individual vortices
and the energy of interaction. The ﬁrst part can be calculated from the exact
analytical solution of the diﬀerential equation of the model (Eq.(20) below).
A nice property of this solution is its ﬁnite extension and no self-interaction,
rendering the problem free from divergences (by contrast to the similar prob-
lem of superconductivity). The second part contains the sum of the energies
of pair interaction, a problem that is principially complicated in our case,
i.e.
in turbulent plasma. Our real vortices are neutral (they are simply a
deformation, stable and regular, of the scalar potential of the velocity) and
there should be no interaction of Coulomb or Ampere type. However there
is an elastic medium between the vortices and any motion of one of them
generates sound waves that may couple with the potential of other vortices,
inﬂuencing their motion. This may suggest that the interaction should be of
the same nature as the Casimir eﬀect. We do not develop here furthermore

6

this discussion. What we minimally need to include in our partition function
is the eﬀect of scattering of the vortices at close encounter, since we do not
take into account in the present treatment the variation of the number of
vortices due to merging (which would imply a chemical potential). There is
an intrinsic spatial scale in all aspects related with drift-wave vortices and
this is the Larmor radius, altered by the combined eﬀect of the diamagnetic
and a uniform ﬂow. We show below that the pair interaction contains a ker-
nel which is not Dirac δ function but a function with spatial decay over this
distance, K0 (r) (the modiﬁed Bessel function). There are several reasons to
assume that this is a physically correct choice (see [5]) but in any case, the
eﬀect of this choice is small.

The second aspect of the problem of vortices acted upon by turbulence is
related to the direct modiﬁcation of the exact vortex by the random waves
around it. The case of a single vortex interacting with random waves has
been treated in the papers [2], [3]. The starting point is the exact vortex-
type solution of the diﬀerential equation we investigate. This is of course a
non-random object and the statistical ensemble when it is isolated is trivial.
However its interaction with random waves of the background turbulence
makes it also a random object. We calculate the statistical properties of the
ensemble of states of the ﬂuctuating potential corresponding to the shapes
of the vortex-type solution.

The action functional is extremum at the vortex solution, whose explicit
expression we will use. The turbulent ﬁeld also realizes the extremum of the
action, but our separation between structures and random waves amounts to
an approximative representation of the turbulent ﬁeld, as a complimentary
part to the structures. “Almost all” nonlinear interaction is included in
the turbulent part except the generation of structures (for example, in the
case of the KdV equation this would correspond to the processes leading to
equality of the nonlinearity to the dispersion, i.e. soliton formation). This
separation will make the purely turbulent part to depart from extremum but
still to remain a very good approximation of the solution of the equations
of motion. Then we have to explore the functional space of the system ’s
conﬁguration in the neighborhood of the structure (the extremum) trying
to include as many as possible nearby conﬁgurations in the calculation of
the generating functional. This will include into the generating functional
the turbulent ﬁeld, besides the structure. In few words, the idea is that the
structure and the random waves, although very diﬀerent in geometry, share a
common property: they obtain or are very close to the extremum of the action
functional. The technical procedure will consists of expanding the action
functional to second order around the structure and to integrate over the

7

space of conﬁgurations. This will automatically exclude bad approximations,
i.e. the states which are too far from realizing the extremum of the action
since for them the Boltzmann weight is exponentially small.

We conclude by noting that this is the standard semiclassical treatment
In this sense it is similar to the treatment of vortex statistics of the

[6].
Abelian-Higgs model of superﬂuids [8] and of many other systems.

1.2.2 The turbulent ﬁeld inﬂuenced by random vortices

For the turbulent ﬁeld interacting with vortices, our approach combines two
distinct elements. The ﬁrst is the inclusion of the vortices as a random
perturbation in the generating functional of the turbulent waves. The second
is a careful treatment of the intrinsic nonlinearity of the turbulent waves,
already modiﬁed by the inclusion of the eﬀect of the random vortices.

In the ﬁrst part we follow the similar approaches as for the electron con-
duction in the presence of random impurities, or as for ﬂexible polymers in
porous media. The replica method, in general well suited for these problems,
is technically diﬃcult to apply and we ﬁnd an alternative way. For the case
where the vortices have uncorrelated random positions and take at random
positive or negative amplitudes of equal magnitude we ﬁnd that the prob-
lem is mapped onto the sine-Gordon model (actually sinh). For our model
equation (18) this will amount to a renormalization of the coeﬃcient which
plays the role of a physical “mass” of the turbulent ﬁeld, or, in other terms
to a shift of the spatial scale from ρs (1

vd/u)−1/2 to higher values.

−
The second part consists of a systematic perturbative treatment of the
nonlinearity in order to get, as much as possible, a correct representation
of the nonlinear content of the ﬁeld of the turbulent waves (this means the
nonlinear interaction between low amplitude random waves). The nonlinear-
ity is included in a functional perturbative treatment where the turbulent
plasma is driven by random rise and decay of modes at marginal stability.
This induces a diﬀusive behavior of the turbulent ﬁeld, at lowest order. We
develop the treatment to one-loop, which means of order two in the strength
of the nonlinearity.

One may inquire if this is not in contradiction with the separation op-
erated at the beginning, where the most characteristic aspect of the nonlin-
earity, the generation of structure, is treated separately. However, it is clear
that there is no danger of overlapping and double counting of the nonlin-
ear eﬀects. Since a perturbative treatment is essentially an expansion in a
parameter representing the departure from Gaussian statistics we can only

8

hope to include higher cumulants beyond the second one (which means Gaus-
sianity) but only few of them are accessible by eﬀective calculation. Or, any
structure needs a very large number of cumulants since, by deﬁnition, is an
almost coherent ﬁeld. It is illusory to try to capture the structure using a
perturbative treatment starting with state of equilibrium (i.e. no perturba-
tion). Since any term of the perturbation can be represented by a Feynman
diagram, we face the well known problem that the proliferation of diagrams
at high orders leads to an eﬀectively intractable problem. This is actually
one reason for the use of the semiclassical methods.

2 Choice of the physical model. The equation

The model of the ion drift instability in magnetically conﬁned plasmas can
be formulated using the ﬂuid equations of continuity and momentum con-
servation for electrons and for ions. It has been shown by a multiple space
time scale analysis that the dynamics is dominated by two nonlinearities:
the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima type, or vectorial nonlinearity, generated by
the ion polarization drift and the Korteweg-De Vries, or scalar nonlinearity,
related to the space variation of the density gradient length. The former if of
high diﬀerential degree and is dominant at small spatial scales, of the order
of few sonic Larmor radii ρs. The latter is dominant at “mesoscopic” spatial
scales, of the order of √ρsLn. The numerical studies (Mikhailovsky), the
ﬂuid-tank experiments (Nezlin) and the multiple space-time scale analytical
analysis (Spatschek) show that the scalar nonlinearity becomes dominant at
late regimes in the statistical stationarity of the turbulent plasma. However
the possible manifestation of the two types of nonlinearity rises the problem
of structural stability of either regime where only one of these nonlinearity
si considered dominant: inclusion of the other strongly changes the behavior
of the system. It is then pertinent to consider that the turbulence generated
in a realistic regime may include manifestations of both types. The turbu-
lence is dominated by the larger scales supported by the scalar nonlinearity
regime (described by the Flierl-Petviashvili equation) together with robust
vortices generated at the scales of few ρs, typical the CHM nonlinearity. The
vortices generated at the scales where the scalar nonlinearity is dominant are
also robust, although they are not solitons. Transitory phenomena of vortex
generation can appear due to the destabilization of sheared ﬂows.

2.0.3 Few comments on numerical or analytical two-dimensional

spectra

It has been shown that at large time the scalar nonlinearity dominates over
the vectorial nonlinearity. This is valid for turbulent two-dimanional plasma
where the spatial scales of the order of √Lnρs appears to be dominant at late
regimes, possibly as a manifestation of the inverse cascade and the tendency
to structuring at larger scales. There are numerical studies of ﬂuid and also
of MHD [17], [13]. In time the dipole vortices speciﬁc to Hasegawa-Mima are
transformed into monopole vortices.

The paper [22] it is suggested that the departure of the exponents of
cascade from universality may be due to coherent structures. We will see
that the various contributions to the spectrum of the turbulence (in the
present treatment) depend on factors whose amplitude detremine to which
extend they will be manifested in the total spectrum.

In the paper [21] it is studied by numerical simulation the turbulence in
2D of the inviscid Navier-Stokes ﬂuid (or guiding center plasma). If u (k) is
the velocity ﬁeld in Fourier space, the spectrum is

where E is the electric ﬁeld derived from the scalar stream function (or

B velocity.

An interesting aspect is the existence of two regimes that can be identiﬁed
in the decay of turbulence of the two-dimensional inviscid ﬂuids. It appears
that there is a limit separating a domain of the initial conditions from where
the system evolves to a random turbulence with equipartition of the vorticity
and a spectrum

The drift wave turbulence on spatial scales covering the scales of the
Hasegawa-Mima equation and the mesoscopic range of the scalar nonlinearity,
evolves to stationarity which is attained in a regime governed by the Flierl-
Petviashvili equation, (18). These scales are ρs and √Lnρs. The plasma
dynamics over these two ranges of characteristic scales will have a dynami-
cal behavior governed by large scale ﬂows, with variations on the direction
transversal to the ﬂow of the order, for example

as for the stationary periodic ﬂow of the Flierl-Petviashvili equation, mixed
with vortices sustained by the CHM polarization drift nonlinearity, of the

on the larger scale. We will adopt the one-dimensional section of the solution
(i.e. Eq.(20)) when we calculate the eigenmodes of the determinant of the
second functional derivative of the action. The two dimensional radially
symmetric solution is not known to be stable and is actually obtained by
extremising a functional, starting with a form suggested by the solution of a
generalized Renormalized Long Wavelength equation (closely related to the
FP equation). The one-dimensional solution (20) is stable.

In the turbulent state, the vortices will be generated and destroyed at a
certain rate. They rise by collecting (coagulating) the elements of vorticity, a
process that is known as vortex merging and develop up to some amplitude;
they move in space and interact with the random drift waves; eventually they
are destroyed due to a random perturbation of amplitude larger than a certain
threshold. For solitons this threshold has been approximately established at

13

about 20% of the amplitude, in numerical studies of Zabusky and Kruskal
[39]. For the vortices of the CHM equation it is not even known if they
are stable (see Nycander); a negative answer would mean that there is no
threshold of the amplitude of the perturbation leading to destruction of the
vortex, but in this case one should estimate the time of life of the vortex
as a coherent structure, assuming that the decay is not instantaneous. The
prototype of CHM vortex is the Larichev-Reznik modon, a solution which is
dipolar. This is however broken into patches of opposite-sign vorticity and
one of them is decaying much faster than the other. This suggests that using
monopolar vortices is pertinent.

It is not clear if the CHM equation may support monopolar vortices (see
Tajima, McWilliams). We can prove that it does, at large time, equivalent
to asymptotic relaxation [5].

We will consider coherent structures which are monopolar vortices of both
signs of vorticity, with equal magnitudes and with random position in plane.

4 Statistical analysis of the physical system

4.1 General functional framework

Consider a diﬀerential equation. We may say that there is a diﬀerential
operator F , which acting on the unknown function φ gives zero

F [φ] = 0

The solution is noted φz. Consider that the unknown function belongs to a
space of functions φ (x, y). We want to select from this space of functions
precisely the one that is the solution of the diﬀerential equation and for this
we can use the functional Dirac δ

δ (φ

φz)

−
Any operation that will be done on a functional of φ can be now particularized
to the solution φz by simply inserting this Dirac functional. For example the
calculation of a functional Ω (φ) at the function φz can be done by a functional
integration over the space of all functions, with insertion of this δ functional

Ω (φz) =

D [φ] Ω (φ) δ (φ

φz)

−

Z

However this is useful when we know the solution φz. But even without
knowing explicitly the solution φz we can use the Dirac δ with the equation

(24)

(25)

(26)

that deﬁnes φz. For the example above this is done in the following way.
Since

which is a direct generalization of the formula for real variables, instead of

functions, with the Dirac δ-functional

We can take out the factor with the functional derivative of F to φ since it is
calculated at φz and so it is not dependent on the functional variables φ or
χ. This part will be symbolically included in a factor that will also represent
the normalization for the generating functional that will be calculated.

The general method for constructing the action functional for a classical
stochastic system is described in [27], and in path integral form, in [28]. Two
reviews by Krommes are very useful references on this point [29], [30].

The discretisation of the equations of motion in each point requires the
functional over the variables representing the discrete values of F (φ) in every
point. Since we next formulate the integration in terms of the discrete values
of the ﬁeld φ itself, we make implicitly a change of variable which must
be accompanied by multiplying the measure with the Jacobian, δF/δφ, the
factor that has been exhibited in the formulas above. The calculation of
the Jacobian related to this discretization of the functional integral has been
made by DeDominicis and Peliti, and other authors, and is brieﬂy presented
in Appendix 2. Its role is explained and it will result that, in our approach
where we use two functional variables in the integration, i.e. φ and its dual
χ, the Jacobian has no eﬀect and needs not to be calculated.

We will deﬁne the partition function as usual, by the functional integral

of Boltzmann weights calculated on the base of the MSR action

D [φ] D [χ] exp

dxdy (χF [φ] + Jφφ + Jχχ)

The functional integration takes into account the ﬂuctuations of the physical
ﬁeld φ and of its dual χ. This expression may still contain random parameters
which are present in one of the possible realizations. The expression must be
averaged over the statistical ensemble of that random quantity. This will be
the case when we will calculate the generating functional for the background
turbulence in the presence of randomly placed vortices.

5 Vortices with random positions

5.1 The discrete set of N vortices in plane

The action of the discrete set of vortices is determined by the sum of the
actions of the individual vortices plus a part that results from the interaction
between them [8]. The ﬁrst part is simply the time integration of the energy,
i.e.
(since time factorizes) the space integration of the expression of the
product of the static potentials associated with a single vortex, Eq.(20), and
to its dual, which in the end simply means the square of the wave-form of
the vortex potential. This quantity is repeated for each of the N vortices.

The interaction between vortices is a diﬃcult problem and probably
largely dependent on the turbulent background.
In numerical simulations
of neutral ﬂuids it seems that the vortices behave independently when they
are distant, but they merge with accelerated relative motion when they are
brought in close neighborhood. It is possible that the background acts as a
medium supporting ﬂuctuations which can induce correlated motions of vor-
tices and that the interaction has the same nature with the Casimir eﬀect.
In the superﬂuid case (to which we make frequent reference) the vortices
that correspond to the extremum of the action (self-duality) do not interact
(see Jacobs and Rebbi [37]) for a particular relation between the parameters,
but this requires asymptotic stationarity in plasma physics. We will adopt a
simple while reasonable assumption, taking the potential of mutual interac-
tion as a short range function, modeled with the same expression as for the
superﬂuids, instead of simply taking Dirac δ functions. Then the partition

The ﬁrst factor simply takes into account N independent vortices with
arbitrary positions in plane and expresses the fact that this part of the parti-
tion function results from a Cartesian product of the N statistical ensembles,
one for each vortex. The factor N! takes into account the permutation sym-
metry. The generating functional for a static vortex with structure given by
the interaction with random waves, is calculated in Eq.(92) using (89) and
(88) below. We have

Z (0)

V = ZV ϕ [J]
where we have indicated by the index V ϕ that the partition function of the
vortex includes the interaction vortex-turbulence, and that the expression
depends on the external current J, and will contribute to any correlation
that we will obtain by functional derivations at J.
The sum is over the set of conﬁgurations

choices of positive and negative vortices, in general unbalanced.

The integrations over the positions of the centers R(a) of the vortices,
a = 1, N, express the fact that we allow arbitrary positions in plane, with
equal probability. Each integral is normalized with the area of the physically
interesting two-dimensional region of the plane, A.

The exponent of the Boltzmann weight contains action resulting from
the interaction between vortices. We expect that for a dilute gas of vortices,
where the distance between the centers R(a)
R(b) is much larger than the
core diameter d,

the interaction is very weak. In order to describe the interaction between
vortices we start from the alternative model of the drift waves sustained by
the ion polarization drift nonlinearity [13]. In this model it is considered a
set of Nω point-like vortices of strength ωi interacting in plane by a short

18

range potential expressed as the function K0 (modiﬁed Bessel function) of
the relative distance between vortices. The potential φp in a point R is a

ez is the versor perpendicular on the plane). Although not all mathe-
(where
matical problems related with the equivalence of the physical model and the
point-vortices model are clear, the latter model has been successfully used
in the physics of atmosphere [26], [25] and in plasma physics [16], [18], [19].
The distribution of vorticity of the physical system (in particular the quasi-
coherent vortical structures) represents spatial variations of density of these
point-like vortices. The interaction between the physical vortices will result
from the interaction between the point-like vortices, taking into account the
density of these objects. The energy of interaction is

called the Kirchhoﬀ function. The range of spatial decay of the interaction
is the Larmor sonic radius ρs, which however may be modiﬁed to an eﬀective
Larmor radius, in the presence of gradients and ﬂow. When we approach the
continuum limit Nω → ∞
the envelope of the density becomes the physical
vorticity ω (x, y) which, for this stage of the problem is suﬃciently to be
considered as highly concentrated in the cores of the physical vortices and
almost vanishing in the rest. Taking the elementary point-vortices of equal
ω0 we have that each physical vortex is a integer multiple N (a)
strength ωj ≡
of this quantity. We will associate with each physical vortex a continuous
function, i.e. its vorticity deﬁned on the whole plane, ρ(a)
ω (x, y), which is, as
said, concentrated in (x, y)

Due to Eq.(40) the interaction energy is only the interaction between the
centers R(a) and R(b) of the vortices. The summation of the ﬁrst line leads
to the second line by grouping the point-vortices into physical vortices, then
assuming that these (for only this stage of the problem) have δ-function shape
and ﬁnally formally replacing this δ with a continuous distribution ρ(a)
ω (x, y).
In this operation a number of inﬁnities arise from the energy of the interaction
of the point-vortices which are grouped into one physical vortex, since the
relative distances are zero for them. This singular part can be removed since
it does not participate to the functional variations.

For simpliﬁcation of the computation we now only consider physical vor-
tices of equal amplitude (positive or negative) and then the vorticity distri-
bution ρ(a)
ω (x, y) has amplitude ωv = pω0 (p is an integer), multiplied by the
integer n(a) which can take the values
1 for positive or negative vorticity.
We have N (a) = pn(a).

If we take the number N of vortices ﬁxed, we should stop here, with the
observation that the partition function Z (0)
(with nonvanishing contribution
V
to the derivatives to J) is decoupled from the other factors and will provide
N-times the same contribution. The other factors, i.e. the functional integral
that contains the interaction between the vortices can only appear in the ﬁnal
answer as a constant, multiplying contributions coming from Z (0)
V [J]. The
situation is however diﬀerent when we allow for a variable number of vortices
in the plasma. When N is variable the partition function must also include
a sum over terms each corresponding to a number N of vortices. This sum
is simple to be done and gives

In this expression the quantity Z (0)
is a functional integral over the space of
V
ﬁelds φs (x, y) representing a single vortex. In the absence of the background
turbulence the ﬁeld φs (x, y) is a deterministic quantity [Eq.(20)] and the
statistical ensemble is trivially composed of one element. The interaction
with the background turbulence induce a ﬂuctuating form and the statistical
properties can be obtained from Z (0)
V . In other words, ZV includes two sources
of ﬂuctuations: one is the ﬂuctuation of the ﬁeld of vorticity due to the
random positions in plane of the vortices (the gas of vortices) and the other
is the ﬂuctuation of the shape of the generic vortex due to interaction with
the turbulent background.

(cid:21)(cid:27)

If we want to use the expression (51) as a generating functional for correla-

The formulas are taken at J = 0. The ﬁrst terms in these equations are
related with the ﬂuctuations of the vorticity of the gas of vortices as a con-
tinuous version of the discrete set of physical vortices with arbitrary positions
in plane. The other terms are related to the ﬂuctuation of the shape of a
vortex and in order to calculate these contribution we need the explicit ex-
pression of ZV , as a functional of Z (0)
V . Further, we will need the detailed
expression of Z (0)

V [J] and this will be calculated in the next Section.

In order to obtain the contribution from the ﬂuctuation of the gas of
vortices (the ﬁrst terms in Eqs.(53) and (54)), we introduce a new term in
the action, consisting of the interaction between the vorticity distribution
ρω (R) and an external current, Jω

1
ωv Z

−

dxdy [ρω (x, y) Jω (x, y)]

(55)

This current Jω is an external excitation applied on the ﬁeld of the vorticity
and not on the ﬁeld of potential φV as we would need in the Eq.(10). We may
assume that there is a connection between the current Jω and the current
J (which acts on the ﬁeld φV ) but there is no need to specify this relation.

23

Indeed, the Eq.(12) shows that at the end both currents should be taken
zero.

Every derivation to the current Jω suppresses a space integration and in
consequence the result is multiplied with factors ρs which render the space
integral dimensionless. To clarify the action of the operators like ∆ we will
use the Fourier representation of the ﬁelds. In the exponential the integration
over space dxdy can be done and selects in the product of variables the pairs
of wavenumbers k and

We can comment on this result. Would we have neglected the arbitrary
position in plane of the vortices and the interaction between physical vortices,
. The ﬁrst k-dependent factor
the only term that would persist is exp
in Eq.(83) comes from assuming that a statistical ensemble of realizations
of the vorticity ﬁeld is generated from the random positions in plane of the
vortices, even reduced at a δ-type shape.
In practical terms this may be
represented as follows: in a plane, an ensemble of vortices can be placed at
arbitrary positions. We construct the statistical ensemble of the realizations
If we measure in one point the ﬁeld, it will be
of this stochastic system.
zero for most of the realizations and it will be ﬁnite when it happens that
a vortex is there. This is a random variable. Now, if we measure in two
points and collect the results for all realizations, the statistical properties of
this quantity (the two-point auto-correlation) has a Fourier transform that is
given by the two factors multiplying the curly bracket in Eq.(83), divided to
k4 (since we have the auto-correlation of the vorticity). When the interaction
is considered, the factor in the curly bracket appears.

We remember that this result has been obtained within the only exception
from our initial setting, i.e. admitting that the number of vortices can be

29

arbitrary. This has produced the supplementary term in the bracket. The
spectrum is changed, with a term that depends on the shape of the vortex, in
particular on the way this is modiﬁed by the interaction with the turbulence.

To calculate the generating functional of the vortex in the background
turbulence we proceed in two steps: we solve the Euler-Lagrange equation
for the action (89) obtaining the conﬁguration of the system which extremises
this action; further, we expand the action to second order in the ﬂuctuations
around this extremum (which will include the turbulent ﬁeld) and integrate.
The Euler-Lagrange equations have the solutions

Since we have assumed as an acceptable approximation to neglect the av-

term in the RHS is zero. For the ﬁrst term we use Eq.(96). We have

The expressions are complicated (see the Appendix of Ref.[3]) and some
numerical calculation of these expression is unavoidable. For small amplitude
of the turbulent ﬁeld the expression can be rewritten

i.e.
in a form that expresses the fact that the two-point correlation is ba-
sically the auto-correlation of the potential of the exact soliton modiﬁed by
a function f which collects the contributions from the interaction with the
random ﬁeld. In k-space we have

resulting from the interaction vortex-turbulence, we have σ
and it results A = B = 1. In this case f

’s beta function).

for a small amplitude ﬁeld φ. This can be done by approximations, starting
from the solution of the equation without random centers.

α

We can see that the immediate eﬀect of the scattering of the turbulent
ﬁeld by the vortices is a renormalization of the coeﬃcient α of the equation.
The solution that we need for Eq.(150) must reﬂect the fact that we
are examining a turbulent ﬁeld, in the dynamics of which the randomly
placed vortices have been included. We can see that the integration over
the auxiliary variable s must not necessarily be truncated to ensure that
s√2Q remains positive. This is because the ﬁeld is turbulent and
αs ≡
there is no restriction concerning the existence of the vortex solution which
should be imposed to the turbulent component of the ﬁeld. We also note
that the approximation taking only the s = 0 contribution in the integral
(148) returns us to the problem of the turbulent ﬁeld without interaction
with the random vortices. Although the main contribution (as shown by the
Gaussian integration) comes from the free turbulent ﬁeld itself, the presence
of vortices is contained in the rest of the integral, for

not close to 0.

These remarks suggest to study the statistical properties of the trans-

formed ﬁeld, where α is replaced with αs.

8 The background turbulence: perturbative

treatment

The vortices represent the strongly nonlinear part of the system and they
have been extracted and treated separately as shown above. However, there is
still nonlinear interaction in the remaining random ﬁeld. This is the nonlinear
mode coupling which produces the stationary turbulent states of the system,
even in absence of any deﬁnite structure formation. This interaction must be
taken into account when we analyse the statistical properties of the turbulent
ﬁeld. From general consideration we know what can be expected from this
analysis: we will obtain a small departure from pure Gaussian statistics,
expressed in nonlinear renormalization of the propagator and of the vertex
of the interaction. The presence of random interaction with elements of the

43

system that are beyond our simple model is accounted, as usual, by a noise
term acting like a drive for the system of random waves. The noise will be
assumed with the simplest (white) statistics

In the generating functional there are the two dual functions, η (x, y) and
φ (x, y), the second being the physical ﬁeld of the random waves. We have
inserted the action related with interaction with “external” currents, Jη and
Jφ which will permit to express the averages as functional derivatives.

This is a classical framework for diagrammatic expansion.

In general the functional approach is well suited for statistical problems
where the statistical ensemble of the realization of the system’s conﬁgurations
is produced by the eﬀect of a noise or by a random choice of initial condition,
as explained in MSR and Jensen. In the most usual case, where there is a
noise acting on the system, using the (known) statistical properties of the
noise means implicitly that we make a change of variables, from the ﬁeld φ
to the noise ζ and this introduces a Jacobian,

[φ] =

[ζ] /

[φ]

(179)

D
The Jacobian cancels all the diagrams that correspond to the vacuum to
vacuum transitions, or equal-coordinates correlations. For this reason it is
not mentioned. This is explained in Appendix B.

D

J

When applying the operator to the second exponential we have to remind
that we need at least two open ends with currents Jφ since we intend to
determine the spectrum. On the other hand, it is clear that any open end
with isolated either Jφ or Jη would vanish after taking the currents to zero.

47

The ﬁrst term is naturally the diﬀusion driven by the random rise and

decay of marginally stable modes, represented here as a noise.

The next term that is useful consists of the product of two vertex-like

operators applied on a product of four propagator-like terms

10 Appendix A : physics of the equation

It is of interest to study a realistic two-dimensional model, like Hasegawa-
Wakatani or similar. However we need for the beginning a simpler equation
and if possible with a vortex solution with known analytical expression.

A possibility is the equation for the ion drift instabilities but here we

must specify the scales.

variables.

11 Appendix B : Connection between the MSR

formalism and Onsager-Machlup

In our approach the most natural way of proceeding with a stochastic diﬀer-
ential equation is to use the MSR type reasoning in the Jensen formulation.
The equation is discretized in space and time and selected with δ functions
in an ensemble of functions (actually in sets of arbitrary numbers at every
point of discretization). The result is a functional integral. There is however
a particular aspect that needs careful analysis, as mentioned in the previous
Subsection. It is the problem of the Jacobian associated with the δ functions.
This problem is discussed in Ref.[34] and for consistency we include here the
essential of their original treatment.

The equation they analyse is in the time domain and is presented in most

general form as

∂φj (t)
∂t

=

−

(Γ0)jk

δH
δφk (t)

+ Vj [φ (t)] + θj

Vj is the streaming term which obeys a current-conserving type relation

The noise is θj.

The following generating functional can be written

Then it is used to ignore all such loops and together with the Jacobian.
In conclusion we can compared the two starting points in a functional
approach: The one that uses dual functions φ (t) and χ (t), closer in spirit to
MSR; And the approach based on Onsager-Machlup functional, traditionally
employed for the determination of the probabilities. Either we keep χ (t) and
ignore the Jacobian (the ﬁrst approach) or integrate from the beginning over
χ (t) and include the Jacobian. The approaches are equivalent but we have
followed the ﬁrst one.

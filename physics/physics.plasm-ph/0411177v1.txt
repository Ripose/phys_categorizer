Abstract. The analysis of energy balance of coronal holes gives that to accelerate the
fast solar wind streams the energy ﬂux of the order of 800 erg/cm2 s is needed. Axford
and McKenzie suggested that the energy source, necessary to accelerate fast solar wind,
is in the regions of strong magnetic ﬁeld that deﬁne the boundaries of chromospheric
supergranules.
If the magnetic ﬁeld is not strictly unipolar in these regions, the
necessary energy is released in the processes of impulsive reconnection events. For
the plasma parameters appropriate for the coronal base such processes of impulsive
reconnection are accompanied by the generation of Alfven and fast magnetosonic waves
with the period of the order of 1 s. On the basis of kinetic equation the model for
the evolution of Alfven waves in solar wind is suggested. The induced scattering of
these waves by plasma ions is considered as the dominant mechanism of dissipation of
Alfven waves. The description of the evolution of the wave spectra in the process in
the processes of their propagation till the distance of 187 solar radii was found.

1. Introduction

The solar wind which is formed by the gas-dynamic expansion of solar corona into
the interplanetary space can be divided into two states: the fast (> 700 km/s) and
400 km/s) streams. The fast solar wind originates in the polar coronal holes,
slow (
106 K, plasma density n = 108 cm−3 and magnetic
where electron temperature T
ﬁeld at the coronal base B0
10 G [1], [15]. Variations of the velocity of this fast
solar wind streams are insigniﬁcant (700–800 km/s). The slow solar wind is associated
with transient openings of closed ﬁeld regions in the corona. The streams of slow wind

unipolar in this regions, then the necessary energy is released in the processes of
impulsive reconnection of magnetic ﬁeld lines on the characteristic spatial scale of
network activity l = 100 km. Such processes of impulsive reconnection should be
accompanied by the generation of Alfv´en and fast magnetosonic waves. Using the
parameters of plasma at the coronal base described above we can ﬁnd the Alfv´en wave
107 cm/s,
velocity VA = B/√4πnmi = 2
and the characteristic time of magnetic ﬁeld lines reconnection [16]:

ﬂux necessary to accelerate fast solar wind is estimated as 8
s [1] and the
major part of the energy of generated waves should be dissipated within one-two solar
radii above the solar surface.

As the dominant mechanism of dissipation of Alfv´en waves generated by the
processes of impulsive reconnection of magnetic ﬁeld lines, we will consider the induced
scattering of Alfv´en waves by plasma ions [11]. The great part of this model was
developed in paper by Galeev and Sadovski [7] For the sake of simplicity we limit
ourselves by the case of the circularly polarized Alfv´en waves propagating along the
radial magnetic ﬁeld B0 = B0(r)z from the polar coronal holes (the wave vector
k = (0, 0, k), where r is the radial distance from the center of the Sun). For the
solar wind we can ﬁx the following ordering of the ion cyclotron ωci, Alfv´en ωk and ion

(2)

where ωci = eB0(r)/mic, ωk = kVA. Under this conditions plasma is magnetized and
the resonant condition describing the interaction of Alfv´en waves with the diﬀerent
polarization propagating in the opposite directions along the magnetic ﬁeld lines can be
written as:

ωk + ωk′

(k + k′) vz = 0,

k′VA < 0, k, k′ > 0 and vz is the velocity along the

magnetic ﬁeld.

In the next section we will describe the evolution of the Alfv´en waves spectrum
in the processes of their propagation and show that the wave energy ﬂux necessary to
accelerate the fast solar wind can be dissipated at the heights of 1-2 solar radii above
the solar surface that is required by the Withbroe [22] analysis.

2. Evolution of Alfv´en wave spectrum in the processes of their propagation

Evolution of Alfv´en wave amplitudes in the processes of their propagation into the
interplanetary space we calculated theoretically assuming that the interplanetary
magnetic ﬁeld B0(r) and the solar wind velocity u are radial and spherically symmetric,
the Alfv´en waves are circularly polarized, the wave amplitudes are small

In the process of wave propagation the position of the spectral break is shifted to
the low frequencies [20]. The position of spectral break frequency is deﬁned by the
particular solution of the equation (5) which can be construct from the general solution.
We can ﬁnd the exact position of the spectral break frequency as a function of
radial distance by dividing both sides of this equation by the Alfv´en wave velocity [7]:

equation (8) we ﬁnd the ratio of the spectral energy density of Alfv´en waves propagating

the intensity of waves propagating to the Sun is six times lower than those for the waves
propagating from the Sun.

where the wave energy is totally absorbed in the ion cyclotron resonance.

To estimate the fraction of Alfv´en wave energy transferred to the protons of solar
wind plasma in the process of induced scattering of waves we use, following Tu [19], the
equation for the magnetic moment of protons. Doing this we take into account that due
2k5/3 has
to the smallness of the left-hand side of the equation (10) the product
a very weak dependence on the wave vector k. Therefore the right-hand side of (10)
also depends weakly on k and we can rewrite it in form [7]:

Non-adiabatic heating of the protons related to the presence of the volumetric
energy ﬂux Π(r) reach only 0.16 K/nT in the range of radial distances [3R⊙, 200R⊙].
Therefore the source of energy for the acceleration of fast solar wind from the polar
coronal holes must now be found in the solar corona itself [14].

Below the spectral brake frequency fbr(r) we have the spectrum of Livshits-
Tsytovich [12], [18] with the spectral index α =
1. However this spectrum doesn’t
extend from fbr to the whole low frequency domain but truncated by the WKB solution.

3. Conclusion

Using the collisionless kinetic equation for interacting Alfv´en waves in the random phase
approximation we have followed analytically the evolution of these waves in the process
of their propagation from the polar solar corona. As a result of such evolution the
boundary of waves with the spectral index α =
1 is shifted towards low frequencies
due to induced scattering of waves by ions, which increase energy of ions by the recoil
eﬀect. However, this spectrum does not extend over the whole low frequency range but
is truncated by WKB solution.

−

Above the frequency fbr the spectrum with the spectral index α =

5/3 is obtained.
Let us note that both in the polar solar corona and in the interplanetary space the
approximation of collisionless plasma is valid at least up to the distance 0.87 AU.

A PARTICLE IN THE BIO-SAVART-LAPLACE MAGNETIC
FIELD: EXPLICIT SOLUTIONS

D. R. YAFAEV

Abstract. We consider the Schr¨odinger operator H = (i∇ + A)2 in the space
L2(R3) with a magnetic potential A created by an inﬁnite straight current.
We perform a spectral analysis of the operator H almost explicitly. In par-
ticular, we show that the operator H is absolutely continuous, its spectrum
has inﬁnite multiplicity and coincides with the positive half-axis. Then we
ﬁnd the large-time behavior of solutions exp(−iHt)f of the time dependent
Schr¨odinger equation. Equations of classical mechanics are also integrated.
Our main observation is that both quantum and classical particles have al-
ways a preferable (depending on its charge) direction of propagation along the
current and both of them are conﬁned in the plane orthogonal to the current.

1. Introduction

They are very few examples of explicit solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation
with a magnetic potential. Probably the only ones are a constant magnetic ﬁeld,
B(x, y, z) = B0, (see, e.g., [3]) and, in the two dimensional case, a magnetic ﬁeld
localized at the origin, B(x, y) = B0δ(x, y) where δ(x, y) is the Dirac function (see
[1]). The solution is expressed in terms of Hermite functions in the ﬁrst case and in
terms of Bessel functions in the second case. Here we suggest a third example of an
explicitly solvable Schr¨odinger equation. Actually, we consider the magnetic ﬁeld
B(x, y, z) created by an inﬁnite straight current. Physically, this case is opposite
to the case of an (inﬁnitely) thin straight solenoid considered in [1] by Aharonov
and Bohm where the ﬁeld is concentrated inside the solenoid.

Suppose that the current coincides with the axis z and that the axes x, y and z

are positively oriented. According to the Bio-Savart-Laplace law (see, e.g., [5])

B(x, y, z) = α(−r−2y, r−2x, 0),

r = (x2 + y2)1/2,

where |α| is proportional to the current strength and α > 0 (α < 0) if the current
streams in the positive (negative) direction. The magnetic potential is deﬁned by
the equation

B(x, y, z) = curl A(x, y, z)

and can be chosen as

(1.1)

A(x, y, z) = −α(0, 0, ln r).

Thus, the corresponding Schr¨odinger operator in the space L2(R3) has the form

H = Hγ = −∂2

x − ∂2

y + (i∂z − γ ln r)2,

γ = eα,

where e is the charge of a quantum particle of the mass m = 1/2 and the speed of
the light c = 1.

Since magnetic potential (1.1) grows as r → ∞, the Hamiltonian H does not ﬁt
to the well elaborated framework of spectral and scattering theory. Nevertheless, we
perform in Section 2 its spectral analysis almost explicitly. To be more precise, we
reduce the problem to an ordinary diﬀerential equation with the potential γ2 ln2 r
(let us call it logarithmic oscillator). We show that the operator H is absolutely
continuous, its spectrum has inﬁnite multiplicity and coincides with the positive
half-axis. Then we ﬁnd in Section 3 the large-time behavior of solutions exp(−iHt)f
of the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation. In Section 4 we integrate equations of
classical mechanics. Our main observation is that positively (negatively) charged
quantum and classical particles always move in the direction of the current (in the
opposite direction) and are localized in the orthogonal plane.

A detailed presentation of the results of this note can be found in [6].

2. Spectral analysis of the operator H

Let us ﬁrst consider a more general magnetic potential

(2.1)

A(x, y, z) = (0, 0, A(x, y))

with an arbitrary (we disregard here domain questions) real function A(x, y) which
tends to inﬁnity (either +∞ or −∞) as r = (x2 + y2)1/2 → ∞. The corresponding
Schr¨odinger operator is

H = −∆ + (i∂z + eA(x, y))2,

where ∆ is always the Laplacian in the variables (x, y). Since A does not depend
on z, we make the Fourier transform Φ = Φz in the variable z. Then the operator
H = ΦHΦ∗ acts in the space L2(R2 × R) as

where

(2.2)

(Hu)(x, y, p) = (h(p)u)(x, y, p),

h(p) = −∆ + (p − eA(x, y))2.

Here p ∈ R (the momentum in the direction of the z-axis) is the variable dual to z
and the operator h(p) acts in the space L2(R2).

Since A(x, y) → ∞ or A(x, y) → −∞ as r → ∞, the spectrum of each operator
h(p) is positive and discrete. Let λn(p), n = 1, 2, . . . , be its eigenvalues, numerated
in such a way that λn(p) are analytic functions of p. The spectrum of the operator
H, and hence of H, consists of the sets (branches) covered by the functions λn(p),
n = 1, 2, . . . , as p runs from −∞ to ∞. This is similar both to the cases of
the constant ﬁeld where λn(p) = |eB0|(2n + 1) + p2 and to the periodic problem
where the role of the momentum p in the direction of the z-axis is played by the
quasimomentum (see, e.g.
[4]). Thus, the general Floquet theory implies that
the spectrum of H is absolutely continuous, up eventually to some eigenvalues of
inﬁnite multiplicity. Such eigenvalues appear if at least one of the functions λn(p)

A PARTICLE IN THE BIO-SAVART-LAPLACE MAGNETIC FIELD: EXPLICIT SOLUTIONS3

is a constant on some interval. Then this function is a constant for all p ∈ R. On
the other hand, if, say, the function −eA(x, y) is semibounded from below, then

(2.3)

lim
p→∞

inf

(x,y)∈R2(p − eA(x, y))2 = ∞

as p → ∞, and hence limp→∞ λn(p) = ∞ for all n. Thus, we have the following
simple result.

Theorem 2.1. Suppose that A(x, y) is a semi-bounded function which tends either
to +∞ or to −∞ as r → ∞. Then the operator H is absolutely continuous.

Note that the Thomas arguments (see, e.g., [4]) relying on the study of the

operator-function h(p) for complex p are not necessary here.

The problem may be further simpliﬁed if A(x, y) = A(r). Then we can separate
variables in the polar coordinates (r, θ). Denote by Hm the space of functions
u(r)eimθ where u ∈ L2(R; rdr) and m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
is the orbital quantum
number. Then

L2(R2) =

Hm.

∞

Mm=−∞

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

Every subspace Hm is invariant with respect to the operator h(p). The spectra
of their restrictions hm(p) on Hm consist of positive simple eigenvalues λm,1(p) <
λm,2(p) < . . . , which are analytic functions of p. We denote by ψm,1(r, p), ψm,2(r, p), . . .
the corresponding eigenfunctions which are supposed to be normalized and real.

Let us return to the operator H with the potential A(r) = −α ln r. In this case

operator (2.2 ) equals

h(p) = −∆ + ln2(eprγ).

Since Hγu = H−γu, it suﬃces to consider the case γ > 0. It is convenient to transfer
the dependence on the momentum p into the kinetic energy and to introduce the
parameter a = ep/γ ∈ (0, ∞) instead of p. Let us set

K(a) = −a2∆ + γ2 ln2 r,

and let w(a), (w(a)f (x, y) = af (ax, ay), be the unitary operator of dilations in the
space L2(R2). Then

w∗(a)h(p)w(a) = K(a),

a = ep/γ.

We denote by µm,n(a) and φm,n(r, a) eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the re-
strictions of the operators K(a) on the subspaces Hm. It follows from (2.6) that
µm,n(a) = λm,n(p) and φm,n(a) = w∗(a)ψm,n(p). Actually, decomposition (2.4)
is needed only to avoid crossings between diﬀerent eigenvalues of the operators
h(p). It allows us to use formulas of perturbation theory (see, e.g., [4]) for simple
eigenvalues. We ﬁx m and omit it from the notation.

The next assertion is quite elementary but plays the crucial role in the following.

Lemma 2.2. For every n, we have that µ′

n(a) > 0 for all a > 0.

4

Indeed, analytic perturbation theory shows that

(2.7)

µ′
n(a) = (K ′

n(a)φn(a), φn(a)) = 2a

|∇φn(x, y, a)|2dxdy.

ZR2

This expression is obviously positive since otherwise φn(x, y, a) = const.

The next assertion realizes an obvious idea that the spectrum of K(a) converges
as a → 0 (in the quasiclassical limit) to that of the multiplication operator by
γ2 ln2 r, which is continuous and starts from zero.

Lemma 2.3. For every n, we have that lima→0 µn(a) = 0.

Since the function ln r is not semibounded, relation (2.3) is not true in our case.
Nevertheless, taking into account the kinetic energy, we obtain the following result.

Lemma 2.4. For every n, we have that lima→∞ µn(a) = ∞.

In terms of eigenvalues λn(p) of the operators h(p), Lemmas 2.2 – 2.4 mean that
λ′
n(p) > 0 for all p ∈ R and limp→−∞ λn(p) = 0, limp→∞ λn(p) = ∞ (for γ > 0).
Let Λn be multiplication operator by the function λn(p) in the space L2(R). It
follows from the results on the function λn(p) that the spectrum of Λn is absolutely
continuous, simple and coincides with the positive half axis. Let us introduce a
unitary mapping

Ψ : L2(R+ × R; rdrdp) →

L2(R)

Mn=1

by the formula (Ψf )n(p) =

Λn

(of course H = Hm and Λn = Λn,m), and we obtain the following

Theorem 2.5. The spectra of all operators Hm and H are absolutely continuous,
have inﬁnite multiplicity and coincide with the positive half axis.

As a by-product of our considerations, we have constructed a complete set of
eigenfunctions of the operator H. They are parametrized by the orbital quantum
number m, the momentum p in the direction of the z-axis and the number n of an
eigenvalue λm,n(p) of the operator hm(p) deﬁned by formula (2.2) on the subspace
Hm. Thus, if we set

um,n,p(r, z, θ) = eipzeimθψm,n(r, p),

then Hum,n,p = λm,n(p)um,n,p.

3. Time evolution

Explicit formulas obtained in the previous section allow us to ﬁnd the asymp-
totics for large t of solutions u(t) = exp(−iHt)u0 of the time dependent Schr¨odinger
equation. On every subspace with a ﬁxed orbital quantum number m, the problem
reduces to the asymptotics of the function u(t) = exp(−iHmt)u0. Below we ﬁx m
and suppose that γ > 0.

Assume that

(3.1)

(Φu0)(r, p) = ψn(r, p)f (p),

where f ∈ C∞

0 (R). Then it follows from formula (2.8) that

(3.2)

u(r, z, t) = (2π)−1/2

eipz−iλn(p)tψn(r, p)f (p)dp.

The stationary points of this integral are determined by the equation

(3.3)

Since λ′

n(p) > 0, the equation (3.3) has a solution only if zt > 0. We need the

Lemma 3.1. For every n, we have that lima→0 aµ′

n(a) = 0.

Indeed, it follows from equation (2.7) that aµ′

n(a) ≤ 2µn(a). Therefore it remains

to use Lemma 2.3.

Lemma 3.1 means that limp→−∞ λ′

n(p) = 0. The following conjecture is physi-
cally quite plausible and is used mainly to formulate Theorem 3.3 below in a simpler
form.

Conjecture 3.2. For every n, we have that λ′′

n(p) > 0 for all p ∈ R and limp→∞ λ′

Therefore equation λ′

n(p) = v has a unique solution pn = ϕn(v) for every v > 0.

n(ϕn(v))ϕ′

n(v) = 1.

Let Φn(v) = ϕn(v)α − λn(ϕn(v)), θ(v) = 1 for v > 0, θ(v) = 0 for v < 0 and
±i = e±πi/2. Applying to the integral (3.2) the stationary phase method and
taking into account identity (3.4), we ﬁnd that

(3.5)
u(r, z, t) = eiΦn(z/t)tψn(r, ϕn(z/t))ϕ′

n(z/t)1/2f (ϕn(z/t))(it)−1/2θ(z/t) + u∞(r, z, t),

Clearly,

(3.4)

where

(3.6)

lim
t→±∞

||u∞(·, t)|| = 0.

Note that the norm in the space L2(R+ × R) of the ﬁrst term in the right-hand side
of (3.5) equals ||u0||. The asymptotics (3.5) extends of course to all f ∈ L2(R) and
to linear combinations of functions (3.1) over diﬀerent n. Thus, we have proven

6

D. R. YAFAEV

Theorem 3.3. Assume that Conjecture 3.2 is fulﬁlled. Suppose that γ > 0. Let
u(t) = exp(−iHmt)u0 where u0 satisﬁes (3.1). Then the asymptotics as t → ±∞
of this function is given by relations (3.5), (3.6). Moreover, if f ∈ C∞
0 (R) and
∓z > 0, then the function u(r, z, t) tends to zero faster than any power of |t|−1 as
t → ±∞.

Conversely, for any g ∈ L2(R+) deﬁne the function u0 by the equation

(Φu0)(r, p) = ψn(r, λ′

n(p))λ′′

n(p)1/2g(λ′

n(p)).

Then u(t) = exp(−iHmt)u0 has the asymptotics as t → ±∞

u(r, z, t) = eiΦn(z/t)tψn(r, z/t)g(z/t)(it)−1/2θ(z/t) + u∞(r, z, t),

where u∞ satisﬁes (3.6).

4. Classical mechanics

Let us consider the motion of a classical particle of mass m = 1/2 and charge e in
a magnetic ﬁeld created by potential (2.1) where A(x, y) = A(r), r = (x2 + y2)1/2.
We suppose that A(r) is an arbitrary C2-function such that A(r) = o(r−1) as r → 0
and |A(r)| → ∞ as r → ∞. The solution given below is, to a large extent, similar to
the Kepler solution of equations of motion for a particle in a spherically symmetric
electric ﬁeld. However, in the electric case the motion is always restricted to a plane,
whereas in the magnetic case it is conﬁned in the plane z = 0 but the propagation
of a particle in the z-direction has a non-trivial character. We proceed here from
the Hamiltonian formulation. An approach based on the Newton equations can be
found in [6].

Let r be a position of a particle and p be its momentum. Let us write down the

Hamiltonian

H(r, p) = (p2 − eA(r))2

in the cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, z). In the case (2.1) where A(x, y) = A(r), we
have that

H(r, p) = (p2

r + r−2p2

ϕ) + (pz − eA(r))2,

where pr, pϕ and pz are momenta conjugated to the coordinates r, ϕ and z. Since
H(r, p) does not depend on ϕ and z, the momenta pϕ(t) and pz(t) are conserved,
i.e., pϕ(t) = M (M is the moment of momentum with respect to the z-axis) and
pz(t) = P (the magnetic momentum in the z-direction). Therefore Hamiltonian
equations read as

(4.1)

where

(4.2)

and

r′(t) = 2pr(t),

ϕ′(t) = 2M r(t)−2

z′(t) = 2(P − eA(r(t))).

A PARTICLE IN THE BIO-SAVART-LAPLACE MAGNETIC FIELD: EXPLICIT SOLUTIONS7

It suﬃces to solve the system (4.1) since, given r(t), the solutions of equations

(4.3) and (4.4) are constructed by the formulas

(4.5)

and

The solution of the system (4.1) is quite similar to the solution of the Kepler problem
although in our case the eﬀective potential energy (4.2) depends additionally on the
momentum P in the z-direction. In the solutions of the quantum problems, it is
reﬂected by the fact that, for electric spherically symmetric potentials, the variables
can be separated (in the spherical coordinates), whereas in our case the operators
h(p) depend on p.

Thus, to solve (4.1), we remark that

(4.7)

4−1r′(t)2 + V (r(t)) = K,

where K = 4−1r′(0)2 + M 2r(0)−2 + 4−1z′(0)2 is a constant kinetic energy of a
particle. Clearly, (4.7) is the equation of one-dimensional motion (see, e.g., [2])
with the eﬀective potential energy V (r) and the total energy K.
It admits the
separation of variables and can be integrated by the formula

(cid:17)

Note that V (r) → ∞ as r → 0 and r → ∞. Let rmin and rmax be the roots of
the equation V (r) = K (rmin and rmax are the nearest to r(0) roots such that
rmin ≤ r(0) ≤ rmax). It follows from (4.8) that the function r(t) is periodic with
period

and rmin ≤ r(t) ≤ rmax. One can imagine, for example, that on the period the
function r(t) increases monotonically from rmin to rmax and then decreases from
rmax to rmin. Thus, we have integrated the system (4.1) and (4.3), (4.4).

T

Theorem 4.1. In the variable r a classical particle moves periodically according
to equation (4.8) with period (4.9). The angular variable is determined by equation
(4.5) so that ϕ(t) is a monotone function of t and ϕ(t) = ϕ0t + O(1), where ϕ0 =
0 r(s)−2ds, as |t| → ∞. The variable z(t) is determined by equation (4.6).
2M T −1
R

According to equation (4.4) a particle can move in the direction of the current
as well as in the opposite direction. Nevertheless one can give simple suﬃcient
conditions for the inequality

(4.10)

± (z(t + T ) − z(t)) > 0

8

D. R. YAFAEV

(for all t). Indeed, it follows from the Newton equation r′′(t) = −2V ′(r(t)) (which
is a consequence of (4.1)) and expression (4.2) that

r′′(t) = 4M 2r−3(t) + 4eA′(r(t))(P − eA(r(t))).

Using equation (4.4), we see that

2ez′(t) = (r′′(t) − 4M 2r−3(t))A′(r(t))−1.

Integrating this equation and taking into account periodicity of the function r(t),
we see that, for all t,

2e(z(t + T ) − z(t)) =

r′′(s)A′(r(s))−1ds − 4M 2

r(s)−3A′(r(s))−1ds

(4.11)

r′(t)2A′(r(t))−2A′′(r(t))dt − 4M 2

r(s)−3A′(r(s))−1ds.

Let us formulate the results obtained.

Theorem 4.2. The increment of the variable z on every period is determined by
equation (4.11). In particular, if ±eA′(r) < 0 and ±eA′′(r) ≥ 0 for all r, then
inequality (4.10) holds. In this case z(t) = z0t + O(1) with z0 = T −1(z(T ) − z(0)),
±z0 > 0, as |t| → ∞.

In particular, for potentials A(r) = −α ln r and A(r) = −αra where a ∈ (0, 1),
inequality (4.10) holds if ±eα > 0. Note that in these cases the ﬁelds B(x, y, z) =
A′(r)r−1(y, −x, 0)tend to 0 as r → ∞.

It follows from equation (4.4) that if, say, eA′(r) < 0 and the point rcr is
determined by the equation p = eA(rcr), then z(t) increases for r(t) ∈ (rcr, rmax)
and decreases for r(t) ∈ (rmin, rcr). Of course, it is possible that rcr < rmin. In this
case, z(t) always increases. Let us discuss this phenomena in more details on our
leading example A(r) = −α ln r. Then rcr = e−P/γ where γ = eα. The points rmin
and rmax are determined from the equation

V (r) = M 2r−2 + ln2(eP rγ) = K.

The function z(t) is increasing for all t if rcr < rmin or, equivalently, V (rcr) ≥ K
and rcr ≤ r(0). The ﬁrst of these conditions is equivalent to M 2e2P/γ ≥ K or,
since in view of (4.4) e2P/γ = r(0)−2ez

(0)/γ, to

′

M 2r(0)−2ez

(0)/γ ≥ 4−1r′(0)2 + M 2r(0)−2 + 4−1z′(0)2.

′

Thus, z′(0) should be a suﬃciently large positive number (z′(0) ≤ 0 is deﬁnitely
excluded). In this case the condition rcr ≤ r(0) which is equivalent to z′(0) ≥ 0
is automatically satisﬁed. Note ﬁnally that always rcr ≤ rmax, that is the function
z(t) cannot be everywhere decreasing (this is of course also a consequence of Theo-
rem 4.2). Indeed, inequality rcr ≥ rmax is equivalent to V (rcr) ≥ K and rcr ≥ r(0).
The ﬁrst of them require that z′(0) > 0 while the second require that z′(0) ≤ 0.

Thus, positively (negatively) charged classical and quantum particles always
move asymptotically in the direction of the current (in the opposite direction). In
the plane orthogonal to the direction of the current classical and quantum particles
are essentially localized.

We investigate the strongly correlated ion dynamics and the degree of coupling achievable in the
evolution of freely expanding ultracold neutral plasmas. We demonstrate that the ionic Coulomb
coupling parameter Γi increases considerably in later stages of the expansion, reaching the strongly
coupled regime despite the well-known initial drop of Γi to order unity due to disorder-induced
heating. Furthermore, we formulate a suitable measure of correlation and show that Γi calculated
from the ionic temperature and density reﬂects the degree of order in the system if it is suﬃciently
close to a quasisteady state. At later times, however, the expansion of the plasma cloud becomes
faster than the relaxation of correlations, and the system does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium
anymore.

Freely expanding ultracold neutral plasmas (UNPs)
[1] have attracted wide attention both experimentally
[2, 3, 4, 5] and theoretically [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. A main
motivation of the early experiments was the creation of a
strongly coupled plasma, with the Coulomb coupling pa-
rameter (CCP) Γ = e2/(akBT ) ≫ 1 (where T is temper-
ature and a is the Wigner-Seitz radius). From the exper-
imental setup of [1], the CCPs of electrons and ions were
estimated to be of the orders of Γe ≈ 30 and Γi ≈ 30000,
respectively. By changing the frequency of the ionizing
laser, the electronic temperature can be varied, oﬀering
the prospect of controlling the coupling strength of the
electrons and creating UNPs where either one, namely
the ionic, or both components could be strongly coupled.

However, due to unavoidable heating eﬀects [6, 11, 12]
these hopes have not materialized yet, and only Γe ≈ 0.2
and Γi ≈ 2 have been conﬁrmed. Furthermore, the evo-
lution of the expanding plasma turns out to be a rather
intricate problem of non-equilibrium plasma physics for
which a clear deﬁnition of the degree of correlation is not
obvious to begin with.

The goal of this letter is twofold: Firstly, we will for-
mulate a consistent measure of correlation for expand-
ing ultracold plasmas, and secondly we demonstrate that
the strongly correlated regime with Γi ≈ 10 for the ionic
plasma component can be reached by simply waiting un-
til the plasma has (adiabatically) expanded long enough
under already realized experimental conditions. This is
remarkable in the light of alternatives proposed to in-
crease Γi [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] which are experimentally
rather involved.

Substantiating both of our statements theoretically re-
quires the ability to propagate the plasma numerically
over a long time with full account of the ionic correla-
tions. To this end, we have developed a hybrid molecular
dynamics (H-MD) method [9] for the description of ultra-
cold neutral plasmas. In our approach, ions and recom-
bined atoms are propagated in the electronic mean-ﬁeld
potential with the full ion-ion interaction taken into ac-

count. The much faster and weakly coupled electrons, on
the other hand, are treated on a hydrodynamical level.
Elastic as well as inelastic collisions, such as three-body
recombination and electron-impact ionization, are incor-
porated using a Monte-Carlo procedure [16, 18]. The
H-MD approach accurately describes the strongly cou-
pled ionic dynamics and therefore allows us to realisti-
cally study the plasma relaxation behavior for long times.

Assigning Γi for an expanding plasma by extracting a
temperature from the kinetic energy of all ions is compli-
cated by the fact that the radial expansion contributes
considerably to this energy [19].
In our approach, we
can determine a local temperature from the ion velocity
components perpendicular to the (radial) plasma expan-
sion [9]. Additionally, the distribution of thermal veloci-
ties of all plasma ions is found to be well described by a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution corresponding to an av-
erage temperature Ti even at relatively early times. Ex-
perimentally, the time evolution of the average ion tem-
perature is determined from the corresponding Doppler
broadening of optical transition linewidths [19, 20]. The
close agreement between experiment [20] and theory (ﬁg-
ure 1) supports both the experimental scheme of extract-
ing an ionic temperature as well as the assignment of a
temperature to the transversal ion velocities in the H-MD
approach.

Remarkably, the initial relaxation of the average ion
temperature exhibits temporal oscillations, in contrast
to the known behavior of weakly coupled plasmas. For
the latter, the timescale tcorr of the initial build-up of
ion-ion correlations is typically much smaller than the
timescale trel for the relaxation of the one-particle dis-
tribution function. Based on this so-called Bogoliubov
functional hypothesis, which is one of the fundamental
concepts in kinetic theory [21], the diﬀerent relaxation
processes can be separated, resulting in a monotonic
behavior of the correlation energy (and hence the ion
temperature) [22]. Molecular dynamics simulations of
the relaxation behavior of homogeneous one-component

FIG. 1: Calculated ion temperature (solid line) for a plasma
−3 and
of 106 Sr ions with initial peak density ρ0(0) = 2·109cm
electron temperature Te(0) = 38K, compared to experimental
results (dots) [20]. The fact that the experimental ion number
is about a factor of ten larger than in our calculation does
not aﬀect the time evolution of the ionic temperature, since
there is no signiﬁcant adiabatic ion cooling on the timescale
considered in ﬁgure 1.

plasmas show that the ion temperature starts to un-
dergo damped oscillations around its equilibrium value
if both of these timescales become equal, which happens
for Γi(0) >∼ 0.5 [23]. Therefore, the nonmonotonic ion
relaxation observed in ultracold plasmas may be seen as
a direct manifestation of the violation of Bogoliubov’s
hypothesis.

Compared to the homogeneous plasmas considered in
[23], the oscillations of the average ionic temperature
damp out much quicker in the present case. This can
be attributed to the fact that the Gaussian density pro-
ﬁle of the UNPs created in current experiments leads to a
spatial dependence of the correlation timescale tcorr, the
build-up of correlations being fastest in the center of the
plasma where the density is highest, and becoming slower
towards the edge of the plasma cloud. As a consequence,
the local ionic temperature shows not only temporal, but
also pronounced spatial oscillations, which however tend
to become averaged out if the spatial average over the
whole plasma cloud is taken.

Having established the approximate validity of assign-
ing a global temperature to the plasma ions, it becomes
possible to deﬁne a corresponding CCP Γi. While the
initial
ion relaxation reveals some interesting strong-
coupling eﬀects as discussed above, disorder-induced
heating [7, 12] drives the ion component to the border
of the strongly coupled ﬂuid regime Γi ≈ 2 and therefore
limits the amount of correlations achievable in UNPs.
However, so far this could be veriﬁed only for the early
stage of the plasma evolution [7, 12, 19]. The present
H-MD approach allows us to study also the long-time
behavior of the ion coupling.

As can be seen in the inset, Γi quickly drops down to
Γi ≈ 2. After this initial stage, however, Γi starts to
increase again due to the adiabatic cooling of the ions
during the expansion. Indeed, CCPs of more than 10 are
realized at later stages of the system evolution, showing
that cold plasmas well within the strongly coupled regime
are produced with the present type of experiments.

pands, ultimately leading to coupling strengths of 102 or
even larger at very long times. For a classical plasma in
thermodynamical equilibrium, the Coulomb coupling pa-
rameter is a direct measure of the amount of correlations,
and properties such as pair correlation functions etc. can
be parametrized by this single quantity. However, the
UNPs created in the present type of experiments are non-
equilibrium systems. Initially, e.g., they are created in a
completely uncorrelated state, so that the high value of
Γi caused by the ultralow temperature of the ions has no
relation at all with the correlation properties of the sys-
tem. At later times, the system relaxes towards a local
equilibrium. However, the plasma is freely expanding,
and hence constantly changing its steady state. Thus,
the plasma is in a non-equilibrium state at all times, and
one must ask to what extent Γi really parametrizes the
correlations present in the plasma.

“Pair correlation functions” of the plasma of ﬁg.
FIG. 3:
2 at four diﬀerent times τ = 0.54, τ = 1.1, τ = 10 and
τ = 60.7. The ˜Γi indicated in the ﬁgure is obtained by ﬁtting
the distribution of scaled interionic distances (dots) with pair
correlation functions for a homogeneous plasma given in [25]
(solid line).

To this end, we compare Γi as obtained above with an
alternative value ˜Γi (dashed line in ﬁgure 2) parametriz-
ing correlation properties of the plasma. As in [15], we
have calculated the distribution P (r/aloc) of interionic
distances rescaled by the local Wigner radius. These dis-
tribution functions are ﬁtted to the known pair correla-
tion function g(r/a, ˜Γi) of an equilibrium plasma given
in [25] (ﬁgure 3). From the ﬁt, a value ˜Γi is extracted at
several times. As can be seen in ﬁgure 3, at very early
times the distribution of scaled interionic distances is not
very well ﬁtted to a pair correlation function of a homo-
geneous plasma in equilibrium. Again, this is due to the
fact that the system is far away from its steady state,
and a single parameter does not describe the correlation
properties of the plasma in an adequate way. However,
the interionic distances quickly relax, and they are well
described by a pair correlation function of an equilibrium
system at later times. Hence, we conclude that the value
of ˜Γi is suitable for parametrizing the correlation prop-
erties of the plasma cloud once it came suﬃciently close
to equilibrium, and that it indeed reﬂects the degree of
coupling in the plasma.

Comparing Γi and ˜Γi in ﬁgure 2, several conclusions
can be drawn. As discussed above, and has been well
known before, in the very early phase of the system evo-
lution there is no relation between Γi and ˜Γi since the
plasma is too far away from equilibrium. As the plasma
relaxes towards this equilibrium, Γi and ˜Γi rapidly ap-
proach each other, showing that during this stage Γi is a
good measure for the correlation properties of the ions.
In particular, the correlations building up in the system
are indeed those of a strongly coupled plasma with a
CCP well above unity. Moreover, the transient oscilla-
tions characteristic of the relaxation process which are

3

apparent in Γi also appear in ˜Γi, however with a “phase
shift” of π. This phase shift is due to the fact that a
minimum in the temperature means a maximum in Γi
for a given density. Since total energy is conserved, a
minimum in the thermal kinetic energy corresponds to
a maximum in the potential energy, i.e. to an increased
number of pairs of closely neighboring ions, and therefore
to a pair correlation function with enhanced probability
for small distances and consequently a minimum in ˜Γi.

At later times, both curves diverge again and the
plasma evolves back towards an undercorrelated state.
At ﬁrst sight, this seems very surprising since the plasma
should relax towards equilibrium rather than away from
it. However, as argued above, the plasma is freely ex-
panding and the corresponding equilibrium properties
are constantly changing. We interpret ﬁgure 2 as being
again evidence for the break-down of the Bogoliubov as-
sumption of a separation of timescales, in this case of the
correlation time τcorr and the hydrodynamical timescale
τhyd, i.e. the characteristic time for the plasma expansion.
The timescale τhyd may be determined from the rela-
tive change of macroscopic plasma parameters, such as
the ion temperature or density. Due to the transient os-
cillations of the ion temperature we choose the ion den-
sity to characterize the change of the plasma properties

(other choices such as, e.g., a ∝ ¯ρ

conclusions since they result in a simple constant propor-

where we have used the selfsimilar solution for the colli-

mi/(kBTe). On the other hand, binary correla-
tions are known to relax on the timescale of the inverse of
the plasma frequency in the strongly coupled regime [23]
for an initially uncorrelated state, and somewhat slower
if the initial state already exhibits spatial ion correlations
[12], τcorr >∼ ωp,0/ωp. The selfsimilar plasma expansion
then yields

Therefore, τcorr is initially much smaller than τhyd, but
ultimately exceeds τhyd as the plasma expands, leading
to an inevitable break-down of the Bogoliubov condition.
Consequently, the build-up of correlations in the system
cannot follow the changing equilibrium anymore, and cor-
relations freeze out as indicated by the leveling-oﬀ of ˜Γi
towards a constant value.

lations start to freeze out as a function of τ 3

Γ
is determined as the time when the relative deviation be-
tween Γi and ˜Γi is less than ﬁve percent for the last time.
The linear correlation visible in the ﬁgure strongly sup-
ports our reasoning that it is the cross-over of timescales
that is responsible for the freeze-out of correlations.

Thus, we may conclude that the system ultimately ap-
proaches a non-equilibrium undercorrelated state again
due to the correlation freeze-out described above. Still,
the pair correlation functions can well be ﬁtted to those of
an equilibrium plasma at this stage (ﬁg. 3(d)), in contrast
to the behavior at early times. This is due to the fact
that the system went through a phase where equilibrium
spatial correlations have developed which are preserved
during the further evolution of the plasma. Hence, the
system has the correlation properties of an equilibrium
system, however “with the wrong temperature”.

In conclusion, we have simulated an expanding ultra-
cold neutral plasma with special attention to the forma-
tion of ionic correlations. We have found that several
phases can be distinguished in the evolution of the sys-
tem. First, a quick relaxation to local equilibrium occurs,
together with its characteristic transient oscillations of
the ion temperature. After that, the system is close to a
— changing — local equilibrium. In this stage, a CCP
deﬁned from temperature and density indeed is a mea-
sure for correlations in the plasma. Moreover, and this
has, to our knowledge, not been pointed out so far, the
plasma reaches a state well inside the strongly coupled
regime, with Γi >∼ 10. Ultimately, the timescale for equi-
libration becomes longer than the timescale on which the

4

equilibrium changes, thus the system cannot equilibrate
anymore and correlations freeze out. Clearly, ultracold
neutral plasmas are unique systems that evolve through
diﬀerent thermodynamical stages of non-equilibrium and
(near)-equilibrium behavior. Their further experimental
and theoretical study thus should provide new stimulus
for plasma physics as well as for non-equilibrium thermo-
dynamics.

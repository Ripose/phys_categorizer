Abstract

Here diﬀusion and Ware pinch are analyzed as opposed eﬀects for plasma conﬁne-
ment, when instabilities are not considered. In this work it is studied the equilibrium
inductive electric ﬁeld where both eﬀects annul each other in the sense that the av-
erage normal velocity is zero, that is, marginal velocity conﬁnement is reached. The
critical electric ﬁeld deﬁned in that way is studied for diﬀerent values of elliptic
elongation, Shafranov shift and triangularity. A short complementary analysis is
also performed of the variation of the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld along a magnetic line.
Magnetohydrodynamic transport theory in the collisional regime is used as in recent
publications. Axisymmetric and up-down symmetry are assumed.

Introduction

The H-mode is characterized by the suppression of anomalous transport in tokamaks,
because of low plasma turbulence induces by internal barriers[1-3]. As result neoclassical
transport calculations becomes very important in this mode. Diﬀusion in the collisional
regime depends of the pressure gradient at the 95% surface adjacent to the scrape of
layer or SOL, as well as the inductive electric ﬁeld Eϕ. The diﬀusion due to the gradient
pressure is opposed to Ware the pinch eﬀect due to Eϕ.

In previous papers was shown that neoclassical diﬀusion can be treated with great
simplicity in the case of arbitrary plasma conﬁguration, using a new kind of tokamaks
coordinates described there[4-6]. However, suitable direct numerical calculations for dif-
ferent values of elongation, Shafranov shift and triangularity have not been presented
until now. Some previous results on this theme using these coordinates are incomplete,
and they are not using the right parameters for the tokamaks in operation at present.

Here calculations are presented in a diﬀerent way, since we look for the values of Eϕ in
the marginal velocity conﬁnement, that is, when the average velocity on 95 % surface is
zero the results corresponding to marginal conﬁnement ﬂux, that is, the transition from
the outgoing to ingoing ﬂux, could be more interested, but much more diﬃcult to calculate
and a suitable and simple treatment describing this process for any plasma conﬁguration
seem that they have not been publishing until now.

In the calculations now presented there are ﬁrst a suitable normalization procedure
absent in previous calculations as well as an adequate selection of tokamak parameters.
The normalization used here allows us to get results, which can be useful for a diversity
of diﬀerent tokamak plasma conﬁgurations, with diﬀerent values of ellipticity, Shafranov
shift and triangularity.

II Theoretical Treatment

The collisonal transport treatment presented in previous paper for toroidal axisymmetric
plasmas can be written in a more convenient way using dimensionless integrals and vari-
ables, as

where ˜v is the dimensionless normal velocity derived from the velocity < v > along the
magnetic surface normal, and ˜Eϕ1 is a dimensionless electric ﬁeld deﬁned as

Her R1, Bϕ1, Bp1, Eϕ1 and ( ∂p
∂σ )1 are respectively the major radius, toroidal and poloidal
magnetic ﬁeld, inductive electric ﬁeld and pressure gradient at the mid-plane external
point A0 of the magnetic cross section. The plasma resistivity are η⊥ and ηk in the di-
rections perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld lines and Rc is the minor axis
radius. The dimensionless quantity γ1 is the ratio γ1 = Bp1/Bϕ1 between poloidal and
toroidal magnetic ﬁeld at point A0. On the other hand the new dimensionless integrals
ˆIi, i = 1 to 7, are deﬁned as

This results are obtained using MHD equations and assuming toroidal axisymmetry.

In order to get numerical as well as analytic results it is useful to express the family

of magnetic cross sections by the equations

R/Rc = 1 + λ[(E − 1)cosθ + T cos(2θ) − ∆]

,

z/Rc = λ[(E − 1)sinθ + T sin(2θ)]

,

where E, T and ∆ are respectively ellipticity, triangularity and Shafranov shift distortions.
The parameter λ in this equations labels each magnetic surface. The previous equations
are a generalization of the equations presented by Roach, et al[7]. The quantities E, T
and ∆ are dimensionless, however for the analysis and calculations are more useful the
new dimensionless quantities ˜E, ˜T , ˜λ, ˜R and ˜z, deﬁned respectively as

The well know Shafranov shift ∆Shaf is connected to the previous parameters by

∆Shaf = ( ˜∆ − ˜T ) a ,

where 2a is the size of the 95 % magnetic surface measurement at the mid-plane, or in
diﬀerent words, a is the horizontal half-width of the plasma. The equations of the cross
section magnetic lines will be now

III Results

The dimensionless variables deﬁned previously simpliﬁes the computation, because quan-
tities we need for the calculation are: the ratio between poloidal and toroidal magnetic
ﬁelds γ1, the horizontal half-width of the plasma a, the aspect ratio A, the ratio ηk/η⊥,
the Shafranov shift, the ellipticity K and triangularity δ. From K and δ, the values of
E and ˜T are determined. The Shafranov shift, the value of a and the calculated value ˜T
together allow the calculation of ˜∆ and ˜λa.

In this way the family of magnetic surfaces can be determined. Following the proce-
dures described in previous works the family of orthogonal lines can be also determined,
which allows to obtain the curvature function κσ and the function µ(s). All the integrals
needed to obtain the normal dimensionless velocity ˜v can also be performed once the value
of γ1 is given. The velocity ˜v can also be obtained if the ratio ηk/η⊥ is given, and it is
a linear function of the dimensionless toroidal electric ﬁeld ˜Eϕ1. The intersection of that
value with the axis of abscissa allows to determine the critical dimensionless electric ﬁeld
˜Eϕ1crit, for marginal velocity conﬁnement. This ﬁeld will be later determine for diﬀerent
values of ellipticity K, dimensionless Shafranov shift ∆Shaf ranov/a, and triangularity δ.

Following the above described procedure, the ellipticity K and triangularity δ, in Fig-
ure 1, are given as K = 1.76 and δ = 0.25. These correspond to values of E and ˜T :
˜E = 4, ˜T = 0.3. The real procedure we use was a little diﬀerent. We ﬁrst select values
of E and ˜T , in such way K and δ become about their values in JET tokamak[8]. This
procedure is simpler for us, and it is the same idea.

In Figure 1, several cross sections magnetic lines have been drawn for diﬀerent values
of λ in the interval from zero to λa, giving in Eq.(24). The characteristic values for that
ﬁgure are: elipticity K = 1.76; relative Shafranov shift ˜∆Shaf = ∆Shaf /a = 0.3; triangu-
larity δ = 0.25; horizontal half width a = 1.12 m ( 95 % surface ); aspect ratio A = 2.5
and minor magnetic axis ratio Rc = 3 m. From the previous data, the following param-
eters are determined: elliptic dispersion E = 4, see Eq.(25)to (27), relative triangularity
dispersion ˜T = T /(E − 1) = 0.3; relative Shafranov dispersion ˜∆ = ˜∆Shaf + ˜T = 0.9;

relative λ-parameter at the 95 % surface ˜λa = (A + ∆ − T )−1 = 0.1075; the outward
radius RA0, R1 = R(θ = 0) = RA0 = Rc[1 + ˜λa(1 + ˜T − ˜∆)] = 3.38 m; the inward
radius R2 = R(θ = π) = Rc[−1 + ˜λa(1 + ˜T − ˜∆)] = 1.45 m; center plasma radius
R0 = (R1+R2)/2 = 2.42 m and radius at the maximum z, ((dz/dR)Rm = 0), Rm = 2.18 m.
In Figure 2, the function µ(s) is show as a function of θ. This function allows to deter-
mine poloidal ﬁeld around a magnetic surface, once the value Bp1 at the outward point A0
is measured or determined. In order to ﬁnd µ(θ), it is necessary to determine the curvature
of the family of orthogonal lines. The procedure has been explained elsewhere[4]. The
function µ(θ) appears in most of the integrals needed to determine the average normal
velocity < v > ﬁrst calculated by Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter for cross-sections of circular magnetic
surfaces[9]. The function to be used in this work is the central function, plain line. How-
ever, two other µ-functions are also shown to illustrate that function. The upper curve
correspond to the case where the triangularity and Shafranov shift are zero. The lower
curve is just the case of zero triangularity, but the same Shafranov shift than in the main
curve ( central one), where the triangularity is δ = 0.25, as in Figure 1.

Since the function µ(s) shown essentially the behavior of RBp, the upper curve illus-
trate that this product is constant at the inward and outward points, when there is not
triangularity and Shafranov shift. However, the value of RBp, decreases at the uppest
and lowest points because of the ellipticity elongation K = 1.76. The Shafranov shift
modiﬁes this pattern in the way that the values at the inward area are almost constant,
and very low compared with those at the outward point A0. Introducing triangularity as
in the case of the central line does not modify the pattern, but the values at the ﬂat part
of the curve are not so low.

In Figure 3, the dimensionless average normal velocity is shown as a function of the
dimensionless toroidal electric ﬁeld ˜Eϕ1 at point A0, the line here found is the straight
line, because of the normalization here used using the value of (η⊥/Bϕ)(∂p/∂σ)1 at the
point A0. The intersection of that line with the abscissa deﬁne the critical dimensionless
toroidal ﬁeld ˜Eϕ1 for marginal velocity conﬁnement. This critical electric ﬁeld is show as
a function of the elliptic elongation K, where all the other variables are kept ﬁxed at the
values shown in Figure 1, that is, δ = 0.25 and ˜∆ = 0.9. To determine the integrals in or-
der to draw Figure 3 and 4, the value of γ1 is chosen as 0.3, which correspond for instance
to toroidal magnetic ﬁeld Bϕ1 = 5 T eslas and poloidal magnetic ﬁeld Bp1 = 1.5 T eslas.
The ratio of perpendicular to parallel resistivity, ηk/η⊥ has been considered as 1.97 as in
page 669 of Ref.(8). As a way of completion Te is taken as 5 keV .

The Figure 3 shown that the outward velocity due to diﬀusion is opposite by the inward
eﬀect due to the inductive electric ﬁelds Eϕ. After a critical value ˜Eϕ, the characteristic
Ware pinch eﬀect[10] becomes more important, and an average inward velocity < ˜v > is
produced, in such a way that the plasma appears conﬁned as long as instabilities are not
considered. The critical dimensionless electric ﬁeld increase with the elliptic elongation K
if all the parameters are kept ﬁxed, however, the variation is not so large, from 0.8 a factor
to about 1.1 as it is shown in Figure 4. In this ﬁgure has been normalized with a second

6

procedure. First a normalized critical toroidal electric ﬁeld is selected as reference and
denoted by ˜Eϕ1 crit. ref., which in this case corresponds to that given in Fig. 3, where the
characteristic values of the parameters above given. The value of this critical dimension-
less toroidal electric ﬁeld is 29.8106, and correspond also to the horizontal line through
one, which it is also show by a dot line. This kind of normalization is also performed in
Figure 5 and 6. The toroidal electric ﬁelds with the second normalization explain above
are denoted by ˆEϕ1 crit..

The changes due to Shafranov shift with all the other parameters ﬁxed, are more sig-
niﬁcative as illustrates the Figure 5, where the critical electric ﬁeld could be one forth
or 3 times the value of that shown in Figure 3. Furthermore the curve in Figure 4 is
almost linear, but not that in Figure 5, which seems somewhat as a parabola. Finally, in
Figure 6, the change of ˜Eϕcrit with triangularity are shown. There also ˆEϕ1 crit. changes
strongly with δ. More important than this it is that the changes are very signiﬁcative for
low values of δ, and ˆEϕ1 crit. could be lower by a factor 5, and with values of triangularity
no so large, as δ = 0.25. Here also the curve is strongly not linear, however the concavity
of the curve is opposite to that in Figure 6.

IV Conclusion

In most tokamak operation the inductive magnetic ﬁeld eﬀect exceeds the plasma diﬀusion
eﬀect and the Ware pinch eﬀect contract the toroidal plasma column. Here the critical
point where both eﬀect becomes almost equals is studied. This equilibrium situation is
consider as that where the average normal velocity becomes null or void, which will be
deﬁned as the marginal velocity conﬁnement. A suitable normalization procedure allows
to extend our analysis to a large amount of diﬀerent situations in tokamak plasma conﬁg-
urations. The critical toroidal electric ﬁeld changes very little with the ellipticity of the
plasma. However, the changes are very strong with the Shafranov shift and triangularity.
The curves in those last cases seems parabolas, but with opposite curvature. Very large
changes for small values of triangularity have been found, producing changes with a factor
5 for modest triangularity values as δ = 0.25.

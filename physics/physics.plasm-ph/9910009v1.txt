A new variational principle for optimizing thermal density matrices is intro-
duced. As a ﬁrst application, the variational many body density matrix is written
as a determinant of one body density matrices, which are approximated by Gaus-
sians with the mean, width and amplitude as variational parameters. The method
is illustrated for the particle in an external ﬁeld problem, the hydrogen molecule
and dense hydrogen where the molecular, the dissociated and the plasma regime
are described. Structural and thermodynamic properties (energy, equation of state
and shock Hugoniot) are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

Considerable eﬀort has been devoted to systems where ﬁnite temperature ions (treated either
classically or quantum mechanically by path integral methods) are coupled to degenerate electrons
on the Born-Oppenheimer surface. In contrast, the theory for similar systems with non-degenerate
electrons (T a signiﬁcant fraction of TF ermi) is relatively underdeveloped except at the extreme high
T limit where Thomas-Fermi and similar theories apply. In this paper we present a computational
approach for systems with non-degenerate electrons analogous to the methods used for ground
state many body computations.

Although an oversimpliﬁcation, we may usefully view the ground state computations as
consisting of three levels of increasing accuracy [1]. At the ﬁrst level, the ground state wave
function consists of determinants, for both spin species, of single particle orbitals often taken from
local density functional theory

If desired, additional correlations may be included by multiplying the above wave function by
i,j f (rij), where the f will also depend on the type of pair (electron-electron,
a Jastrow factor,
electron-ion). Computing expectations exactly (within statistical uncertainty), with this type of
wave function now requires Monte Carlo methods.

Q

Finally diﬀusion Monte Carlo [2,3] methods using the nodes of this wave function to avoid
the Fermion problem may be used to calculate the exact correlations consistent with the nodal
structure.

The ﬁnite temperature theory proceeds similarly. Rather than the ground state wave function

Q

The Jastrow factor can be extended to ﬁnite temperature and the above density matrix
i,j f (rij, r′ij ; β). In particular, the high temperature density matrix used in path

multiplied by
integral computations has this form.

Finally, the nodal structure from this variational density matrix (VDM) may be used in
restricted path integral Monte Carlo (RPIMC) [4–8]. This method has been extensively applied
using the free particle nodes. One aim of the present work is to provide more realistic nodal
structures as input to RPIMC.

This paper considers the ﬁrst level in this approach. The next section is devoted to a general
variational principle which will be used to determine the many body density matrix. The principle
is then applied to the problem of a single particle in an external potential and compared to exact
results for the hydrogen atom density matrix. After a discussion of some general properties,
many body applications are considered starting with a hydrogen molecule and then proceeding to
warm, dense hydrogen. It is shown that the method and the ansatz considered can describe dense
hydrogen in the molecular, the dissociated and the plasma regime. Structural and thermodynamic
properties for this system over a range of temperatures (T= 5 000 to 250 000 K) and densities
(electron sphere radius rs = 1.75 to 4.0) are presented.

is well known and convenient for discrete systems (e.g. Hubbard models) but the logarithmic
entropy term makes it diﬃcult to apply to continuous systems. Here, we propose a simpler
variational principle patterned after the Dirac-Frenkel-McLachlan variational principle used in
the time dependent quantum problem [9]. Consider the quantity

Finally, we may consider a variation at some arbitrary, ﬁxed R′ to get

It should be noted that in going from Eq. 11 to Eq. 12 a density matrix symmetric in R and

manifestly have this invariance Eq. 13 minimizes the quantity,

[Θ(R, R′; β) +

We propose solving this equation by parameterizing the density matrix with a set of parameters

Various ansatz forms for ρ may now be used with this approach. After considering the analogy to
real time wave packet molecular dynamics, the principle is ﬁrst applied to the problem of a particle
in an external ﬁeld.

III. ANALOGY TO REAL-TIME WAVE PACKET MOLECULAR DYNAMICS

Wave packet molecular dynamics (WPMD) was ﬁrst used by Heller [11] and later applied to
scattering processes in nuclear physics [12] and plasma physics [13,14]. An ansatz for the wave
function ψ(qν) is made and the equation of motions for the parameters qν in real time can be
derived from the principle of stationary action [12],

This leads to a set of ﬁrst order equations, which provides an approximate solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation. However, this principle cannot be directly applied to the Bloch equation
because there is no imaginary part in the density matrix. For this reason, we followed in our
derivation in section II the principle of Dirac, Frenkel and McLachlan [9], which minimizes the
quantity

This method was employed in [10] to obtain the dynamical equations in real time.

The VDM approach and WPMD method share the zero temperate limit, which is given by
the Rayleigh-Ritz principle (see section V A). At high temperature, the width of wave packets
in WPMD grows without limits, which is a known problem of this method [15,16]. In the VDM
approach, the correct high temperature limit of free particles is included. The average width shown
in Fig. 10 can be used to verify the attempts to correct the dynamics of the real time wave packets
in [16].

In ground state variational studies, addition of two more Gaussians brings the ground state energy
to within 0.6% of exact and similar improvement would be obtained here.

Results at ﬁnite β require a numerical solution, which is illustrated in the ﬁgure below
comparing the Gaussian variational density matrix with the exact [17] and the free particle density
matrix at several temperatures for the initial condition r′ = 1. At high temperatures (β = .05 and
β = .25) the Gaussian approximation correctly reproduces the limiting free particle density matrix.
At lower temperatures, the cusp in the exact density matrix due to the Coulombic singularity at
the proton becomes evident and the peak shifts to the origin somewhat faster than the Gaussian
variational approximation. As β increases the exact result grows faster than the variational since
the correct energy, -0.5, is lower than
4/3π but the Gaussian variational approximation remains
rather accurate for r > 1. The free particle density matrix remains centered at r = 1 and beyond
β = 0.5 (T = 54.4 eV) bears little resemblance to the correct result.

V. VARIATIONAL DENSITY MATRIX PROPERTIES

A. Zero Temperature Limit

In the preceding section, it was shown that for the hydrogen atom the Gaussian variational
density matrix, as a function of R converges at low temperature to the Gaussian ground state wave
function given by the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle. It is generally true that the Rayleigh-Ritz
ground state corresponds to a β

of the variational density matrix as we now show.

this is equivalent to Eq. 41 and thus the Rayleigh-Ritz ground state corresponds to a zero

D is a function of R′ and β, which is calculated by integrating from β = 0 with Eq. 25 as

where the function δ(R′) is introduced to describe the variational error in the solution of the Bloch
equation. It is identical to zero if the variational ansatz includes the exact solution. It leads to
loss of symmetry in R and R′, which will discussed in the next section. Eq. 45 now reads,

ρ(R, R′, β

) = e−

βE0ψ0(R)ψ0(R′) [1 + δ(R′)]

For certain potentials, several ﬁxed points of the dynamics can exist. From Eq. 48, it follows
that only the lowest energy state contributes to physical observables calculated from Eq. 3. This
completes the argument that the zero temperature limit of the VDM correspond to the Rayleigh-
Ritz ground state.

In case of an anti-symmetrized ansatz for the density matrix, one can show that the ﬁxed
point of the dynamics in imaginary time corresponds to the Rayleigh-Ritz ground state for an
anti-symmetrized wave function.

B. Loss of Symmetry

The exact density matrix is symmetric under R

R′. Since we have singled out R′ as the
initial point for the imaginary time dynamics, it is not clear that the approximation given in Eq. 29
automatically satisﬁes this condition. For the free particle limit and the harmonic oscillator, where
the Gaussian is the exact solution, it obviously does but in general it does not.

↔

As a speciﬁc example, consider again the ground state limit of the hydrogen atom where the

Gaussian VDM approximation. Eq. 29 then reads,

the virial theorem,
/ 2, between the kinetic and potential energy is violated by about
3% (while both are more accurate than the usual ground state variational Gaussian result). This
has consequences for calculating the equation of state particularly at low density. Slightly more
complicated, explicitly symmetric forms for the VDM could be used but in this paper we will
continue to explore the basic Gaussian approximation.

C. Thermodynamic Estimators

Since the VDM, except in the simplest cases, is not exact various estimators for the same
quantity will diﬀer. For example the variational principle introduced in section II consists
ρ, either of which
essentially in globally minimizing the squared diﬀerence between ∂ρ/∂β and
can be used in estimating the energy. As mentioned above the energy estimator Eq. 51 and its
kinetic and potential energy pieces do not automatically satisfy the virial theorem for Coulomb
systems at low density. As an alternative to Eq. 51, one can use the thermodynamic estimators,

for the total, kinetic and potential energy. These estimators satisfy

by the following argument. Any function f = f (βλ, βe2) satisﬁes

From Eq. 21 it follows that all parameters qi = qi(R′; β, λ, e2) have this property and therefore so
does the variational density matrix.

In the zero temperature limit, the thermodynamic estimators satisfy the virial theorem, which
is also satisﬁed by any exact and any variational Rayleigh-Ritz ground state. From the zero
temperature limit of the VDM given by Eq. 48 and the 1/β factor in Eqs. 53 and 54, it is seen
that the symmetry error δ(R′) is unimportant in this limit. It should be noted that calculating

top left panel shows the Gaussian mean parameter m for the two electrons. These stay in the center of
the bond (m = 0) until about R = 2a0 and then attach themselves to the separating protons (± R/2).
The width parameter, displayed in the lower left panel, makes the transition from the optimal value for
a helium atom, R = 0, to the hydrogen atom result w = 9π/8a2
0 at large R. The right panel shows the
dissociation energy for the singlet state computed from Eq. 51 (open circles with error bars) and the
thermodynamic estimator (−dD/dβ) (dashed line) compared to the results of Kolos and Roothan (solid
line).

Application to an isolated hydrogen molecule at low temperature is shown in Figure 3. This
is for the singlet state (anti-parallel electron spins). The triplet state is considered later after
a discussion of how to treat permutation terms in the parameter equations. The bond length
at minimum energy is 1.47 a0, compared with the experimental value of 1.40 a0. The direct

energy estimator Eq. 51 gives a dissociation energy of 4.50 eV at the minimum compared to the
experimental value of 4.75 eV. Beyond R = 2, the energy rises quickly toward the value given by
the Rayleigh-Ritz estimator

dD/dβ.

VII. ANTISYMMETRY IN THE PARAMETER EQUATIONS

The determinantal form for the VDM, Eq. 58, is correctly antisymmetric under exchange of
identical particles. Since ion exchange eﬀects are negligible at the temperatures considered here
these are ignored.

The determinantal form leads to N ! terms in the equations of motion for the variational
parameters presented in appendix A. It was originally hoped that exchange eﬀects could be ignored
in these equations while retaining the full determinantal form for the VDM but this leads to an
instability in fermionic systems, e.g.
it results in an unphysical strong attraction between two
hydrogen molecules.

A practical means of treating all exchange terms, in particular terms involving the potential
Instead it was necessary to use
energy, in the variational parameter equations was not found.
an approximation similar to that used in the real time computations [13,16]: only pair exchanges
in the kinetic energy terms were retained. This will be illustrated for the hydrogen molecule
after ﬁrst giving the explicit form for this correction.
It is stressed that, unlike the real time
computations, once the variational parameters are determined the full determinantal form is then
used in calculating the various averages.

For two particles with parallel spin, the correction term to the kinetic energy is given by,

These equations lead to an eﬀective repulsion between the Gaussians for two electrons with parallel
spin if there is signiﬁcant overlap. As a example of this eﬀect the variational parameters for the
singlet and triplet states of the hydrogen molecule are compared in Fig. 4. For the triplet state
parameters the solution including full exchange eﬀects (long dashed line) are compared with those

FIG. 4. Eﬀect of antisymmetry on the density matrix parameters, width and mean, for a hydrogen
molecule. The protons (large black dots along x axis) are separated by 1.8a0 and the initial electron
positions re(β = 0) = ±1.5a0 along the molecular axis. The solid line for the singlet state (electron spins
anti-parallel) shows both electrons centered in the molecular bond at low temperatures (large β). For
the triplet state (parallel electron spins), long dashed line the electrons are centered close to the protons.
The approximation of including only kinetic pair exchanges (dot-dashed line) gives a similar result for the
mean, with the electrons centered slightly inside the protons but overestimates the Gaussian width (left
panel). At high temperature (β ≤ 4) exchange is unimportant and the parameters are nearly the same for
all cases.

Even at the lowest temperature considered here in the dense hydrogen simulations (5000 K)
exchange eﬀects between same spin electrons are negligible beyond a few angstroms, i.e. one or
perhaps two nearest neighbors. Fig. 4 for the triplet state thus overestimates the eﬀect likely in
dense hydrogen. The main eﬀect of including exchange in the parameter equations is probably to
prevent the instability mentioned above.

Fig. 5 shows an energy comparison for the triplet ground state of the hydrogen molecule.
First, we compare the Gaussian approximation using only the kinetic exchange term in the
parameter equations. For the direct estimator, Eq. 51, one ﬁnds fairly good agreement with the
quantum chemistry result [18]. The thermodynamic estimator gives a somewhat more repulsive
triplet interaction for R > 2a0. Considering also the Coulomb exchange terms in the Gaussian
approximation leads to the dot-dashed line for the thermodynamic estimator. We conclude that
leaving out the Coulomb exchange terms in the parameter equations for eﬃciency reasons is a
reasonable approximation in many particle simulations.

VIII. RESULTS FROM MANY PARTICLE SIMULATIONS

In this section, we report results from VDM Monte Carlo simulation with 32 pairs of protons
and electrons in the temperature and density range of 5 000 K
4.0.
Although the Gaussian ansatz VDM will be seen to provide a reasonable model for hydrogen over
the full density and temperature regime, a large purpose in presenting these results is to serve as
a base for documenting future improvements from better VDMs and the application of RPIMC.

FIG. 6. Proton-proton pair correlation function from VDM (solid line) and RPIMC (dashed lines at

rs=1.75, 2.0, and 4.0 for T ≤ 125 000 K).

The proton-proton pair correlation functions are shown in Fig. 6. For temperatures below
20 000 K, a peak emerges near 1.4a0 that demonstrates clearly the formation of molecules. The
comparison with RPIMC simulations [8,19] at low density shows that the peak positions agree well
but RPIMC predicts a signiﬁcantly bigger height indicating a larger number of molecules. This
could be explained by the missing correlations in the VDM ansatz.

At a density of rs = 2.0, proton-proton pair correlation functions from RPIMC and VDM are
almost identical. The area under the peak multiplied by the density gives an estimate for the
molecular fraction. By comparing the estimate for diﬀerent densities one ﬁnds that the molecular
fraction is diminished when the density is lowered below rs = 2.0. This eﬀect is well-known and is
a result of the increased entropy of dissociated molecules.

14

Considerable diﬀerences between the proton-proton pair correlation functions are found at
rs = 1.75 below T = 20 000 K where VDM shows still a fair number of molecules while RPIMC
predicts a metallic ﬂuid where all bonds are broken as a result of pressure dissociation [8,20]. This
eﬀect has to be veriﬁed by RPIMC simulations with VDM nodes because free particle nodes could
enhance the transition to a metallic state.

The peak positions shifts from 1.45a0 at a low density of rs = 4.0 to 1.3a0 at rs = 1.75. The
same trend has been found in the RPIMC simulations [8] but the opposite was reported in [21,22].

FIG. 7. Proton-electron pair correlation functions from VDM (solid line) and RPIMC (dashed lines at

In the proton-electron pair correlation functions shown in Fig. 7, one ﬁnds a strong attraction

15

present even at high temperatures such as 250 000 K. At low temperatures, the electrons are bound
in atoms and molecules. This pair correlation function does not show a clear distinction between
the two cases. From studying the height of the peak at the origin multiplied by the density, one
can estimate the number of bound states at low temperature. Similar to the molecular fraction
one ﬁnds a reduction of bound electrons with decreasing density below rs = 2.0. The comparison
with PIMC shows that VDM underestimates the height of the peak. This is probably a result of
the Gaussian ansatz, which does not satisfy the cusp condition at the proton.

the last row.

Fig. 8 shows the eﬀect of the Pauli exclusion principle leading the a strong repulsion for
electrons in the same spin state. This eﬀect is not present in the interaction of electrons with
anti-parallel spin (Fig. 9). At high temperature, one observes the eﬀect of the Coulomb repulsion.
At low temperature, one ﬁnds a peak at the origin that is a result of the formation of molecule,
in which two electrons of opposite spin are localized along the bond. The diﬀerences to the PIMC
graphs can be interpreted as a consequence of diﬀerent molecular fractions, which has also been
observed in Fig. 6.

limit. These become more signiﬁcant with increasing density and decreasing temperature. At low
temperature, the attraction to the protons dominates, which leads to a decreasing average width.

Internal energy per atom versus temperature

In Fig. 11, we compare the internal energy from the thermodynamic estimator in Eq. 52 and
the direct estimator 51. Both agree fairly well at low density. Diﬀerences build up with increasing
density and decreasing temperature. Comparing with RPIMC simulations, one ﬁnds that the VDM
energies are generally too high. The magnitude of this discrepancy shows the same dependence on
density and temperature like the diﬀerence between the two VDM estimators. The diﬀerence to
the RPIMC results could be explained by the missing correlation eﬀects in the VDM method.

At high temperature, the thermodynamic estimator always gives lower energies than the direct
estimator. Below T = 25 000 K, the ordering is reversed. This is consistent with the results from
the isolated atom and molecule. The consequence is that the direct estimator is actually closer to
the value expected from RPIMC simulations. However, it should be noted that this estimator is
not thermodynamically consistent (see section V B).

increasing density and decreasing temperature, the diﬀerence grows. For densities over rs = 2.0
below 10 000 K, one ﬁnds a signiﬁcant drop in the direct estimator for the pressure. We interpret
this eﬀect as a result of the thermodynamic inconsistency.

We expect the diﬀerence of the two estimators to give a rough estimate of the accuracy of the
VDM approach. At high temperature, the diﬀerence is relatively small and agreement with RPIMC
simulations is reasonable. Both VDM estimators indicate that there is maximal compressibility
around 1.5 Mbar. However, in this regime of high density and relatively low temperature a more
careful study seems unavoidable. We suggest RPIMC simulations using the VDM nodal surface to
restrict the paths.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

The VDM approach provides a way to systematically improve the many particle density matrix.
Already the simplest ansatz using one Gaussian to describe the single particle density matrices gives
a good description of hydrogen in the discussed range of temperature and density. The method
includes the correct high temperature behavior and shows the expected formation of atoms and
molecules. The thermodynamic variables are in reasonable agreement with RPIMC simulations.
The presented Gaussian ansatz can be improved in several ways. One could use a sum of Gaussians,
add underestimated correlation eﬀects by including a Jastrow factor in the ansatz or use a two-step
path integral. Further one can use this essentially analytic density matrix to furnish the nodal
surface in RPIMC simulations, replacing the free particle nodes by a density matrix that already
includes the principle physical eﬀects. This level of accuracy seems to be required to determine a
Hugoniot function that is very sensitive to the diﬀerent level of approximations made by various
theories.

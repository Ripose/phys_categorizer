Accelerated recombination due to resonant
deexcitation of metastable states

Abstract

In a recombining plasma the metastable states are known to accumulate popula-
tion thereby slowing down the recombination process. We show that an account of
the doubly-excited autoionizing states, formed due to collisional recombination of
metastable ions, results in a signiﬁcant acceleration of recombination. A fully time-
dependent collisional-radiative (CR) modeling for stripped ions of carbon recombin-
ing in a cold dense plasma demonstrates an order of magnitude faster recombination
of He-like ions. The CR model used in calculations is discussed in detail.

1 Introduction

Recombination of atomic ions in plasmas [1] continues to be a subject of
a permanent interest. Recent measurements of radiative recombination cross
sections for various ions, including the simplest bare ions (see, e.g., Ref. [2] and
references therein), have shown a noticeable and surprising disagreement be-
tween theory and experiment. In addition to such fundamental issues, various
phenomena related to recombination play important roles in plasma kinetics
[3]. A well-known example is provided by a recombination-based formation of
population inversion used for practical lasing in the soft X-ray region [4].

In spite of a widely recognized importance of ion recombination for plasma
evolution, the theoretical eﬀorts were hitherto directed practically only to
the recombinational kinetics of (quasi-)hydrogenic ions while non-hydrogenic
recombination was only scarcely studied [5,6]. As far as recombination is con-
cerned, the major diﬀerence between hydrogenic and non-hydrogenic ions is
the possible presence of long-lived metastable states in the energy spectrum
of the latter. The metastable states accumulate the downward ﬂowing popu-
lation for times of the order of the inverse depopulation rates. Since this rate
could be rather small, the population accumulation would therefore exist for

relatively long times. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the
process of the so-called ”resonant deexcitation” (RD) can signiﬁcantly alter
this picture and, in fact, accelerate the overall recombination process by as
much as an order of magnitude.

The resonant deexcitation, as it is deﬁned here, proceeds in three steps. First,
a free electron is collisionally captured by an excited ion with the spectroscopic
charge Z +1 to form a doubly-excited state of the ion Z. This step is a familiar
collisional 3-body recombination which though originates from excited rather
than ground state of an ion. In the second step, the captured electron may
move upward or downward between high-n states due to collisional excitation
or deexcitation. Finally, the doubly-excited state decays via autoionization
thereby producing an ion with the charge Z + 1, so that the initial and ﬁnal
states of RD belong to the same ion stage. The total chain of elementary
events, i.e., recombination, (de)excitation and autoionization, looks as follows:

X ∗

Z+1 (α) + e + e
X ∗∗
Z (αnl) + e
Z (αn′′l′′)

→
→

X ∗∗
X ∗∗
X ∗

Z (αnl) + e,
Z (αn′l′) + e, ...
Z+1 (α0) + e.

(1)

Here α denotes the quantum state of the initial excited ion, nl are the principal
and orbital quantum numbers of the captured electron, and α0 is the set of the
ﬁnal quantum numbers. The ﬁnal state X ∗
Z+1 (α0) may obviously be also an
excited one (rather than only the ground state) provided the energy diﬀerence
between initial and ﬁnal states of the Z + 1 ion is larger than the ionization
energy of the n′′l′′ electron. The doubly-excited quantum states X ∗∗
Z (αnl) with
diﬀerent nl form a shifted Rydberg series with the ionization limit X ∗
Z+1 (α).

The eﬀect of RD on level populations was independently recognized by Fuji-
moto and Kato [7] and by Jacoby et al. [8] (with respect to the X-ray laser
problem). Later and independently, Koshelev with colleagues [9,10] discussed
the population of doubly-excited levels via 3-body recombination from ex-
cited states. The primary interest in these papers was directed towards either
hydrogen-like ions [7,8] or production of dielectronic satellites [9,10], and there-
fore the importance of RD for recombination of non-hydrogenic ions was not
investigated. Moreover, it was found [8] that the RD channel

in the recombining H-like C VI plasma is negligibly small comparing to the
direct radiative decay n = 3
n = 1. Then, in a recent series of papers
Kawachi et al. [11] investigated a quasi-steady-state recombination of Li-like
Al and showed that accounting for RD results in a better agreement with
experimental data. It should be noted that some groups [7,11] refer to the

described above process of Eq. (1) as the ”DL-deexcitation” which originates
from the inverse process of dielectronic capture and ladder-like excitation. Here
the term ”resonant deexcitation” is preferred since no dielectronic capture is
involved in the process considered.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II contains a detailed description
of the collisional-radiative model used in the simulations. We describe the
major kinetic processes taken into account and indicate the sources of atomic
data. The calculational results for time-dependent recombination of carbon
nuclei and discussion are presented in Section III. Finally, Section IV contains
conclusions.

2 Collisional-Radiative Model

The experimental installations at the Plasma Laboratory of the Weizmann
Institute of Science (coaxial and planar plasma opening switches and Z-pinch)
produce plasmas with diverse and fast-changing properties. The computational
tools required for reliable diagnostics of such systems should therefore both
reﬂect a variety of physical processes happening in plasmas and consistently
describe the temporal behavior of plasma characteristics under very diﬀerent
conditions. The collisional-radiative (CR) package NOMAD was developed to
provide reliable spectroscopic diagnostics of transient plasmas with an arbi-
trary electron energy distribution function. It includes an executable code and
a number of atomic databases containing various related data for many ele-
ments and their ions. A convenient user-friendly interface relies upon the usage
of common Web browsers and provides both textual and graphical options for
the processing of calculated results. The program was written in Fortran 77
with minor extensions from Fortran 90. Presently, the code is running on a
450 MHz Pentium III personal computer with typical run times of the order
of several minutes.

Generally, the CR code solves the following ﬁrst-order system of inhomoge-
neous diﬀerential equations:

d ˆN (t)
dt

= ˆA (Ni, Ne, fe, t) ˆN (t) + ˆS(t),
ˆN (t = 0) = ˆN0,

(3)

where ˆN (t) is the vector of atomic state populations, ˆA (Ni, Ne, fe, t) is the rate
matrix depending on ion density Ni(t), electron density Ne(t) and electron-
energy distribution function fe(E, t), and ˆS(t) is the source function. The

3

electron density can be presented as a sum of two components:

Ne (t) = N 0

e (t) + Ni (t)

NZ,k (t) ,

(4)

Zmax

XZ=Zmin

(Z

−

kmax

Xk=1

where N 0
e (t) is the background electron density and the second term represents
the density of continuum electrons originating from ionization of atoms. In Eq.
(4) Zmin and Zmax are the minimal and maximal spectroscopic charges, index
k enumerates the levels within a speciﬁc ion with charge Z (k = 1 is the
ground state etc.), and NZ,k(t) is the population of the corresponding atomic
level. The level populations are usually normalized:

Zmax

kmax

XZ=Zmin

Xk=1

NZ,k (t) = 1,

(5)

although for calculations with the source function ˆS(t) this condition should
be discarded. The number of atomic states used in speciﬁc calculations can be
chosen depending upon the complexity of a task. There are no fundamental
limitations on the nature of the states involved, and therefore atomic terms,
levels (ﬁne structure components) or conﬁgurations can be equally used in
the CR calculations if necessary 1 . In addition, an arbitrary number of high-n
Rydberg states can be added to each of the ion charge states. The highest in
energy bound state is determined by the ionization potential lowering. This
eﬀect may be accounted for in diﬀerent approximations using Debye-Huckel,
hybrid (Stewart-Pyatt) or ion-sphere formulas [12]. However, an explicit ac-
count of numerous Rydberg states essentially increases the calculation time
and thus is not always practical. In this case, an eﬀective aggregate state,
which is composed of Rydberg states up to the highest bound state, may be
used in calculations.

As was already mentioned above, the model allows for use of an arbitrary
electron-energy distribution function (EEDF). Usually, the EEDF is ﬁrst to
have been calculated with a coupled hydrodynamic plasma code and then
utilized for a detailed CR modeling. It is possible, nevertheless, to approxi-
mate this very complicated problem by using simpliﬁed EEDFs, for example,
Maxwellian+beam or a two-Maxwellian distribution. To this end, the EEDF
f (E) is presented as:

f (E) = (1

α) fM (Te, E) + αf ′ (E) ,

(6)

where fM (Te, E) is the Maxwellian EEDF with an electron temperature Te,
f ′(E) is either the beam or the second Maxwellian EEDF, and 0
1 is

the weight of f ′(E) in the total EEDF. A modeling with an arbitrary EEDF
poses a serious restriction on the data used for the calculation of rates of
atomic processes, namely, cross sections rather than Maxwellian-averaged rate
coeﬃcients have to be used in calculations.

The atomic processes which aﬀect the level populations and are considered
in our model include spontaneous radiative decays, electron-impact collisional
processes (excitation, deexcitation and ionization), various types of ion re-
combination (3-body, radiative and dielectronic recombination), autoioniza-
tion and dielectronic capture, atom-ion or ion-ion charge exchange, and laser
photopumping. The plasma opacity eﬀects are taken into account as well. The
atomic data (either raw or ﬁtted with physically justiﬁed formulas) are stored
in databases, one per element, and the data accuracy is carefully evaluated.

The energy levels and radiative oscillator strengths are mainly collected from
available publications and online databases 2 . Whenever these sources cannot
provide a necessary level of accuracy and/or completeness, the missing ener-
gies and oscillator strengths are calculated with various atomic software, e.g.,
RCN/RCN2/RCG Hartree-Fock package [14], MZ 1/Z-expansion code [15], or
GRASP92 multiconﬁguration Dirac-Fock code [16].

The electron-impact collisional data comprise a majority of atomic data uti-
lized in CR calculations. The existing data on cross sections are rather incom-
plete and mostly cover excitations and ionizations from ground states. Hence,
production of new cross sections becomes a necessity if a detailed diagnostics
is required. Our main source of excitation data is the Coulomb-Born-exchange
unitarized code ATOM [15] which combines a high calculational speed with
a good accuracy, especially for moderately- and highly-ionized atoms. Previ-
ously we have shown that ATOM excitation data for H- and Li-like ions very
well agree with the cross sections calculated by the more sophisticated conver-
gent close-coupling (CCC) method [17,18]. Nevertheless, a use of more precise
data is made whenever possible; for example, our database of collisional cross
sections for neutral Helium was developed using the latest recommended CCC
ﬁts [19]. For comparison purposes or when no other data are available, a sim-
ple van Regemorter formula for excitation cross sections may be utilized as
well. The inverse, deexcitation cross sections are obtained using the detailed
balance principle, the former being implemented also for calculation of other
inverse cross sections from the direct ones (e.g., 3-body recombination from
ionization etc.).

The ﬁts for the electron-impact ionization cross sections from ground states
were obtained using the recommended data compiled by the Belfast group
[20,21] with account of corrections discussed in Ref. [22]. Presently, four op-

tions for calculation of the ionization cross sections from excited states are
available, namely: (i) ATOM data, (ii) Lotz formula [23], (iii) l-dependent
semiempirical formula [24], and (iv) simple classical scaling

(7)

with I and I0 being the corresponding ionization energies from excited and
ground states, respectively. The single ionization is allowed to proceed into
both ground and excited states of the next ion. The multiple ionization which
may be very important for non-equilibrium plasmas, especially in the pres-
ence of high-energy electrons, is also taken into account. The corresponding
cross section connecting ground states of respective ions is calculated with
recommended formulas from Ref. [25].

The photoionization cross sections, which are also used for calculation of ra-
diative recombination data with the Milne formula, are compiled from a few
sources, such as Opacity Project [26], ATOM calculations or other published
compilations and evaluations [27,28]. The less accurate hydrogenic Kramers
formulas are used to calculate the photorecombination into the high-n Ryd-
berg states and/or the aggregate state.

The dielectronic recombination can be taken into account in two ways. One
method consists in an explicit treatment of autoionizing states with a use of
dielectronic capture cross sections and autoionization transition probabilities.
The latter are usually calculated with the MZ or Cowan’s [14] codes and
the former are obtained using the principle of detailed balance. Furthermore,
the collisional and radiative transitions to, from, and between all doubly-
excited autoionizing states are fully accounted for. In the second, less detailed
approach, no autoionizing states are presented in the CR calculations, and
the dielectronic recombination rates are calculated using one of the existing
methods, namely, the modiﬁed Burgess formula [14], ﬁtting formulas of Hahn
[29], or recent recommended ﬁts from Ref. [30].

A two-step procedure is implemented in treatment of the plasma opacity ef-
fects. First, when calculating the level populations, a simple escape factor
method is applied. The dependence of the escape factor on optical depth is
calculated using (i) the ﬁtting formulas produced for a general Voigt line pro-
ﬁle with the Monte-Carlo code TRACE [31] or (ii) Apruzese’s formulas for the
Voigt escape factor [32]. Then, on the second step, when an actual spectrum
is synthesized, the radiation transfer equation for a Voigt proﬁle is solved for
each of the selected spectral lines using the level populations obtained from
the rate equations. The Voigt line proﬁle is constructed from Doppler (Gaus-
sian) and natural+Stark (Lorentz) broadening parts. The Doppler width is
determined by the ion temperature Ti which may be another independent in-

6

put parameter. The depopulating rates from both lower and upper levels of
speciﬁc radiative transitions are used to calculate the inelastic Stark width,
and the elastic Stark linewidth is ignored because of its steep decrease with
electron temperature and small contribution for moderate to high tempera-
tures (see Refs. [33,34] for discussion on elastic contribution). Finally, it is
worth noting that Drayson’s routine [35] is used in the generation of Voigt
proﬁle.

3 Results and discussion

To study the eﬀect of resonant deexcitation on kinetics of recombination,
we consider here the time-dependent recombination of fully stripped ions of
carbon in an optically thin cold dense plasma. This situation may be experi-
mentally implemented, for instance, when a beam of bare ions is injected into
a pre-formed plasma. The recombination of carbon nuclei has already been a
subject of discussion at the NLTE kinetics workshop [36]; however, emphasis
was given to the most general plasma characteristics such as mean ion charge
and therefore no detailed examination of the evolution of level populations
was carried out.

In the present calculation all charge states of carbon from neutral atom up
to the fully stripped ion were retained. The basic atomic states were mainly
the atomic terms characterized by the total angular momentum and spin. The
exceptions are the following: (i) the 1s2l 3P term in C V is split into the ﬁne
structure components, (ii) the doubly-excited autoionizing states in Li-like C
IV and He-like C V are represented by the conﬁgurations 1s2lnl′ (total of
15 states up to 1s2s8l and 1s2p8l) and 2lnl′ (7 states up to n = 8), and
(iii) l-summed states characterized only by the principal quantum number are
used in H-like C VI. Besides, 20 high-n Rydberg states were added to each of
the ion charge states. However, the actual number of Rydberg states becomes
smaller since the ionization potential lowering eﬀectively cuts oﬀ the bound
spectrum. The total number of atomic states was about 180.

The CR calculations were performed for two cases diﬀering in the number (and
nature) of included states. In the ﬁrst case (A), the doubly-excited autoion-
izing states for C IV and C V are excluded from consideration, and thus the
resonant deexcitation channel is closed. Nevertheless, we do account for the
process of dielectronic recombination using the rates recommended by Hahn
[29]. It is worth mentioning that this type of ion recombination is essentially
unimportant for the low temperatures and high densities speciﬁc for the prob-
lem in question. In the second case (B), 22 doubly-excited states in C IV and
C V listed above were added with a detailed account of all relevant atomic
processes (autoionization, dielectronic capture, ionization, 3-body recombi-

7

nation, radiative decays, and excitation/deexcitation). The electron impact
excitation and deexcitation cross sections between these levels were calcu-
lated in the van Regemorter approximation, while the relevant radiative and
autoionization probabilities were determined with the MZ code. In addition,
the collisional and radiative (satellite) transitions of the core electron, e.g.,
1s2pnl

1s2nl + hν, were also taken into account.

For each of the cases A and B, the CR simulations were carried out for several
sets of electron density Ne and temperature Te. Below we mainly discuss the
1019 cm−3 and Te = 3 eV, and comparison with
plasma evolution for Ne = 3
other sets is given when necessary 3 . Both electron density and temperature
were kept constant during the run. The initial population distribution and
temporal history were set as following. At time t = 0 all population is in the
bare nucleus of carbon, and the logarithmic time mesh for basic conditions is
chosen according to:

×

t0 = 0; t1 = 10−16s,
i > 1 : ti = ti−1

1.11344,

(8)

so that t150 = 10−9 s. This ﬁnal time was found to be suﬃcient to reach the
CR equilibrium (CRE) state for both sets of calculations (A and B). For other
than basic conditions, the logarithmic time mesh was properly adjusted in
order to achieve CRE within 150 steps.

Consider ﬁrst the calculated evolution of level populations for case A (no
doubly-excited autoionizing states). The total populations of all charge states
of carbon as a function of time are shown by the solid lines in Fig. 1. The
mostly noticeable feature in this plot is a very long lifetime of the He-like
10−10 s, which exceeds the lifetime of C IV. To examine how
C V ion, t
the metastable states 23S and 23P0..2 aﬀect the C V lifetime, let us compare
the populations of all n = 1 and n = 2 states of C V and the total C V
population (Fig. 2(a)). Note that the components of the 23P term are in
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) due to high collisional rates. The
j=0..2 N(23Pj) shown by
sum of populations of the triplet states N(23S) +
the solid line with squares nearly coincides with the total C V population after
10−11 s which indicates that the lifetime of C V is indeed governed by
t
the n = 2 triplet levels. The radiative decay of the triplet levels to the ground
state is negligibly small comparing to the collisional deexcitation rates which
1010 s−1 for the 23P
for basic conditions are 2.3
term. These values are by factor 3.3 and 2.5, respectively, smaller than the

The long lifetime of C V results in a relatively low peak populations of the C
IV and C III ions (see Fig. 1). As a result, both C V and C II simultaneously
have high populations during a long time of the order of 10−10 s. Had such a
picture of coexisting ion states with very diﬀerent charges be true, it would
allow for a new scheme of laser photopumping when, e.g., the photons from
the 23S
23P transition in a long-living He-like ion would pump a transition
with the same wavelength in another low-charge ion, thereby giving rise to a
possible population inversion. However, the detailed calculations for the case
B disallow such a possibility.

−

→

The case B calculations which were performed with an explicit account of
autoionizing states show a remarkably diﬀerent temporal behavior of the total
ion populations (dashed lines in Fig. 1). Recalling that the doubly-excited
autoionizing states were added to both He- and Li-like ions, one may notice
the earlier appearance of the He-like ion comparing to case A. However, the
lifetime of the H-like ion decreases only by less than 30% due to the RD
channel n = 2
n = 1. This indicates that for the basic conditions the
resonant deexcitation of the n = 2 state of C VI can hardly compete with its
strong radiative decay to the ground n = 1 state. The temporal history of the
He-like and other ion stages is, on the other hand, drastically diﬀerent from the
case A calculations. As is seen from Fig. 1, the lifetime of C V in case B is an
order of magnitude smaller due to a much faster decay of the metastable states
resulting from the resonant deexcitation. The eﬀect of a strong depopulating
RD channel can be clearly seen in Fig. 2(b), where the populations of n = 1
and all n = 2 states for case B are presented. One can notice that both 23S
and 23Pj states have now populations smaller than that of the ground state
while in case A their populations exceed that of the ground state by about two
orders of magnitude. Furthermore, due to a much larger population ﬂux from
C V, the peak populations of C IV and C III are now signiﬁcantly larger (Fig.
1). Thus, one can see that account of resonant deexcitation of the metastable
levels in C V leads to drastic changes in evolution of diﬀerent ions.

The physical picture of resonant deexcitation is quite straightforward. The
highest-n states are quickly populated from the metastable states due to high
3-body recombination rates. The radiative decay of the core electron 2p
1s
does not depend signiﬁcantly on n as long as n is suﬃciently high. The rates
1s2 + εl′′ are lower for higher principal quantum
of autoionization 1s2lnl′

numbers (Aa(n)

depopulation for the highest-n states is a ladder-like collisional deexcitation
to lower doubly-excited states. When the population ﬂow reaches those states
for which the autoionization probability is comparable or larger than the de-
excitation rate, the downward ﬂow is redirected into the C V ground state, so
that the lowest doubly-excited states have small populations.

An approximate formula for the RD rate can be found assuming that the popu-
lations for the doubly-excited autoionizing states above the so-called ”thermal
limit” [9] are in the Saha-Bolzmann equilibrium with their ”parent” excited
state of the next ion [8]. The thermal limit is deﬁned as the state for which
the rate of collisional processes is of the order of autoionization probability,
and the corresponding principal quantum number nth for the thermal limit
may be estimated from the expression [9]:

The summation is extended above the thermal limit up to the highest bound

mined by the ionization potential lowering. Here we assume that the ioniza-
tion energies of the autoionizing states are given by the hydrogen-like formula
In = Z 2Ry/n2 with Ry = 13.61 eV being the Rydberg energy. For low tem-
peratures, which are the subject of the present work, the ﬁrst term in this sum
with n = nth gives an overwhelming contribution due to a strong exponen-
tial dependence on n. In agreement with this conclusion our modeling shows
that the doubly-excited states 1s2l3l′ and 1s2l4l′ indeed provide the largest

Retaining only the ﬁrst term in Eq. (10) and using a well-known expression for
autoionization probability in terms of the excitation cross section at threshold

Thus, the RD rate for low-temperature plasmas shows a strong dependence
on electron temperature (cf. T −4.5
behavior of the 3-body recombination rate)
and a moderate, slightly stronger than linear, dependence on electron density.
The Te-dependence is illustrated in Fig. 3 where we present the time evolution
of carbon charge states for Te = 2, 5 and 10 eV and a constant density of Ne =
1019 cm−3. It is clearly seen that the diﬀerence between the simulations

with (solid lines) and without (dashed lines) RD is mostly noticeable for the
lowest of temperatures while for Te = 10 eV both sets of calculations produce
almost identical evolution of charge states.

modeling (Fig. 1) for C V where the characteristic decay time is of the order
of 10−11 s. Such a discrepancy may be in part due to strong deviations from
the Saha-LTE regime for the doubly-excited states during the fast recombi-
nation which is considered here. Our calculations show that during the time
when C V is mostly abundant, only the highest autoionizing states 1s2l8l′
(and 1s2l7l′ to a lesser extent) have Saha populations while the others deviate
strongly from the respective Saha limits. As for the 1s2l3l′ and 1s2l4l′ states
which mostly contribute to resonant deexcitation, their populations diﬀer by
as much as a factor of 5. Nevertheless, a use of the eﬀective RD rate from
Eq. (12) in CR calculations without doubly-excited states results in charge
state evolution which is rather close to that obtained from the detailed simu-
lations with autoionizing states and RD included (case B). The charge state

11

populations shown in Fig. 4 were calculated for these two cases for Ne = 1020
cm−3 and Te = 5 eV. (Similar results are obtained for other sets of plasma
parameters.) One can see that both characteristic decay times and peak ion
populations are reproduced within a few tens of percent. It is interesting to
note that this situation is similar to the coronal approximation where line in-
tensities do not depend on the radiative decay probability and are determined
only by the collisional excitation rates. In the present case, the RD rate is
equivalent to the radiative rate while the ﬂux of population coming from the
upper states due to cascades is analogous to excitation in corona. Thus, as
long as the rate of resonant deexcitation from metastable states exceeds other
depopulation rates, the population ﬂux downward is determined only by the
cascade contribution and thus is not too sensitive to the actual value of the
RD rate.

4 Conclusions

Although resonant deexcitation is already known for a long time, its signiﬁ-
cance for plasma kinetics does not seem to have been fully appreciated so far.
A particular problem of recombination of ions with metastable states shows
that a consistent account of resonant deexcitation via the doubly-excited au-
toionizing states, which are collisionally populated from the excited states of
the next ion, can considerably alter the entire picture of recombination. This
process may be important, for instance, in kinetics of recombination lasers
or for beam-stopping problems. It would certainly be interesting to conduct
experiments that could test the conclusions made in the present paper.

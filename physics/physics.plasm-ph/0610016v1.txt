This paper gives a pedagogic review of the envelope formalism for ex-
citation of zonal ﬂows by nonlinear interactions of plasma drift waves
or Rossby waves, described equivalently by the Hasegawa–Mima (HM)
equation or the quasigeostrophic barotropic potential vorticity equation,
respectively. In the plasma case a modiﬁed form of the HM equation,
which takes into account suppression of the magnetic-surface-averaged
electron density response by a small amount of rotational transform, is
also analyzed. Excitation of zonal mean ﬂow by a modulated wave train
is particularly strong in the modiﬁed HM case. A local dispersion relation
for a coherent wave train is calculated by linearizing about a background
mean ﬂow and used to ﬁnd the nonlinear frequency shift by inserting the
nonlinearly excited mean ﬂow. Using the generic nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation about a uniform carrier wave, the criterion for instability of
small modulations of the wave train is found, as is the maximum growth
rate and phase velocity of the modulations and zonal ﬂows, in both the
modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed cases.

1. Introduction
As of January 1, 2006, Wikipedia1 introduces the term “zonal ﬂow” thus:

Fluid ﬂow is often decomposed into mean and deviation from the
mean, where the averaging can be done in either space or time, thus
the mean ﬂow is the ﬁeld of means for all individual grid points. In
the atmospheric sciences, the mean ﬂow is taken to be the purely
zonal ﬂow of the atmosphere which is driven by the temperature

contrast between equator and the poles.
In geography, geophysics, and meteorology, zonal usually means
‘along a latitude circle’, i.e. ‘in the east-west direction’. In atmo-
spheric sciences the zonal coordinate is denoted by x, and the zonal
wind speed by u.

Fig. 1. Left panel shows NASA image PIA04866: Cassini Jupiter Portrait, a mosaic of 27
images taken in December 2000 by the Cassini spacecraft. Right panel shows a simulation
of plasma potential ﬂuctuations in a tokamak cut at a ﬁxed toroidal angle as produced
by the GYRO code (courtesy Jeﬀ Candy http://fusion.gat.com/theory/pmp/). Note
that, in the plasma case, zonal ﬂows are in the y-direction when slab geometry is used.

The above deﬁnition omits the further qualiﬁcation that zonal ﬂows
are restricted to bands (zones) of latitude. This is most clearly seen in the
banded cloud patterns on Jupiter (see left panel of Fig. 1) where the magni-
tude, and even sign, of the zonal ﬂows varies with latitude in a quasiperiodic
fashion. (On Earth, topographic variations like mountain ranges disrupt the
zonal symmetry.)

The term “zonal ﬂow” has also recently come to be much used in toroidal
magnetic conﬁnement plasma physics (see e.g. the review of Diamond et
al.2) to refer to a mean poloidal ﬂow with strong variation in minor radius.
The sheared nature of this ﬂow is thought to have the strongly beneﬁcial ef-
fect of reducing radial transport by suppressing turbulence, thus improving
the conﬁnement of heat required to achieve fusion conditions.

The use of the same phrase “zonal ﬂow” in the context of both geo-
physics and magnetic plasma conﬁnement is no coincidence, as the exis-

tence of strong analogies between these ﬁelds has become well recognized.3
In this paper we work in the plasma context, but point out the relation to
the geophysical context when appropriate.

The right panel of Fig. 1 depicts a section of a simulated tokamak, show-
ing turbulence excited by gradients in temperature and density (the plasma
being hotter and denser in the middle section, which has been cut out to aid
in simulation and visualization). The radial coherence length of the drift-
wave eddies has been reduced by spontaneously excited zonal ﬂows. The
magnetic ﬁeld is predominantly in the toroidal direction, but there is some
component in the poloidal direction so that the magnetic ﬁeld lines wind
helically around the torus, mapping out nested toroidal magnetic surfaces
that conﬁne the magnetic ﬁeld in topologically toroidal magnetic ﬂux tubes.
The helical nature of the magnetic ﬁeld lines can be seen in the ﬁgure from
the fact that the turbulent eddies have their cores essentially aligned with
the magnetic ﬁeld, making the turbulence quasi-two-dimensional despite
the manifestly three-dimensional nature of the tokamak.

A generalized polar representation would clearly be most appropriate
for representing the cross-sectional plane of the torus, but, for the purpose
of gaining physical insight with a minimum of formalism in this paper we
use slab geometry. That is, the toroidal magnetic surfaces are imagined
as ﬂattened into planes, so that Cartesian coordinates, x, y, z, can be
used, with y and z replacing the poloidal and toroidal angles, respectively,
and x the minor radius. The x and y directions are indicated in the right
panel of Fig. 1. The slab approximation is the analogue of the β-plane
approximation in geophysics, but note the axis convention is opposite to
that used in geophysics, with y now the zonal direction.

Modulational

instability of drift waves (the analogue of planetary
Rossby waves) is a strong candidate4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 for generating these zonal
ﬂows through a feedback mechanism, in which modulations of the wave en-
velope excite zonal ﬂows through a nonlinear mechanism (Reynolds stress)
and the zonal ﬂows enhance the modulation through a self-focusing mech-
anism.

It is the aim of this paper to elucidate this theory in a pedagogic
way using as simple a plasma description as possible, namely the one-
ﬁeld Hasegawa–Mima equation.10, 11 This provides a simple theoreti-
cal starting point for describing the nonlinear interaction of drift waves
and zonal ﬂows.11, 5 The same equation also describes Rossby wave
turbulence in planetary ﬂows in the quasigeostrophic and barotropic
approximations.12, 11, 13 To emphasize its geophysical connections, we

shall follow a common practice in the plasma physics literature and call
the original form of the Hasegawa–Mima equation the Charney–Hasegawa–
Mima (CHM) equation (although in the geophysical literature the equation
is called the “quasigeostrophic barotropic potential vorticity equation”14).
Unfortunately for the interdisciplinarity aﬀorded by the use of the CHM
equation, it became recognized in the early ’90s15, 16 that a corrected form
for toroidal plasma applications should be used, which we shall call the Mod-
iﬁed Hasegawa–Mima (MHM) equation. Although the modiﬁcation seems
at ﬁrst glance to be minor, we shall show that it makes a profound diﬀerence
to the modulational stability analysis because it enhances the generation
of zonal ﬂows.

Some early works on modulational instability of drift waves can be found
in Refs. 17, 18, 19 but these predate the recognition of the need to use the
MHM equation to enhance the nonlinear eﬀect of zonal ﬂows in a toroidal
plasma. Both Majumdar18 and Shivamoggi19 add a scalar nonlinearity,
arising from polarization drift and/or temperature gradient, to the CHM
equation in order to ﬁnd a nonlinear frequency shift. In the Mima and
Lee17 paper, the nonlinear frequency shift comes from time-averaged ﬂow
and density proﬁle ﬂattening.

In Sec. (2) we introduce the CHM and MHM equations and in Sec. (4)
we introduce the generic form of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, which
describes the time evolution of modulations on a carrier wave, and use it
to derive a criterion for modulational instability. In Sec. (5) we use the
MHM and CHM equations to derive the nonlinear frequency shift of a
ﬁnite-amplitude drift/Rossby wave and use it to determine the criteria for
modulational instability of drift and Rossby waves, respectively. Section (6)
contains conclusions and directions for further work.

2. The CHM and MHM equations
The Charney–Hasegawa–Mima equation (CHM)11, 13 is an equation for
the evolution in time, t, of the electrostatic potential ϕ(x, y, t) (or, in the
Rossby wave application, the deviation of the atmospheric depth from the
mean11). Here x and y are Cartesian coordinates describing position in a
two-dimensional domain D, representing a cross section of a toroidal plasma
with a strong magnetic ﬁeld, B, predominantly in the z-direction (unit
vector ˆz).

In the slab model we take D to be a rectangle with sides of length Lx
and Ly. A circular domain would clearly be more realistic geometrically

because it has a unique central point, representing the magnetic axis, but
it is unlikely to add any qualitatively new physics. In strongly shaped toka-
maks, like the one depicted in Fig. 1, one might be tempted to give D the
noncircular shape of the plasma edge to add yet more realism. However, we
caution against this line of thinking because each point in D represents an
extended section of ﬁeld line, over which the drift-wave amplitude is signiﬁ-
cant. That is, D does not represent any given cross section of the tokamak,
but rather a two-dimensional surface in a ﬁeld-line coordinate space (see
e.g. Ref. 20), onto which behaviour in the third dimension is projected.

We assume the ion temperature to be negligible with respect to the
electron temperature Te, assumed constant throughout the plasma. The
strong magnetic ﬁeld allows the plasma to support a cross-ﬁeld gradient
in the time-averaged electron number density, ¯n, and the wave dynamics is
taken to be suﬃciently slow that, along the ﬁeld lines, the electrons respond
adiabatically to ﬂuctuations in ϕ. That is, on a given ﬁeld line they remain
in local thermodynamic equilibrium, with distribution function f (r, v, t) =
const exp(−E/Te), where Te is the electron temperature in energy units
(eV) and E is the total electron energy 1
2 mv2 − eϕ, with m the electron
mass and e the electronic charge.

Following Hasegawa and Mima, the shear in the magnetic ﬁeld is as-
sumed very weak, so that z-derivatives and the parallel component, kk,
of the wave vector k can be neglected, thus reducing the problem to a
two-dimensional one. However, the existence of magnetic shear is crucial in
one qualitative respect—the foliation of the magnetic ﬁeld lines into nested
toroidal magnetic surfaces (x = const in slab geometry). Field lines cover
almost all magnetic surfaces ergodically, so the constant in the expression
for the distribution function is a surface quantity. Integrating over velocity

equations, without introducing the distribution function explicitly.

One can show, by surface-averaging the continuity equation for the elec-
tron ﬂuid in the absence of sources or sinks, that the surface-averaged elec-
tron density is independent of t. Thus, to O( ˜ϕ), n0 is independent of t and
equals the prescribed average density ¯n. This would not be the case if we
had not subtracted oﬀ ϕ in Eq. (1), and in this we diﬀer from Hasegawa and
Mima but follow most modern practice since Dorland et al.15, 16 pointed
out the importance of modifying the electron response in this way. Use of
Eq. (1) leads to what we shall call the Modiﬁed Hasegawa–Mima equation
(MHM equation).

Deﬁning a switch parameter s such that s = 0 selects the original CHM
equation and s = 1 the MHM equation, and a stream function ψ ≡ ϕ/B0,
we write Eq. (10) of Hasegawa et al.11 as

being the E×B velocity (SI units), ζ ≡ ˆz·∇×vE = ∇2ψ the vorticity,
ωci ≡ eB0/mi the ion cyclotron frequency, and ∇ ≡ ˆx∂x + ˆy∂y the perpen-
dicular gradient. As shown in the Appendix of Meiss and Horton13, this
is an approximate form of Ertel’s theorem for the conservation of poten-
tial vorticity under Lagrangian advection at the E×B velocity. Note that
the MHM equation satisﬁes the expecteda Galilean invariance under boosts
in the poloidal direction, y′ = y − V t, E′ = E + V B0 ˆx (so ψ′ = ψ − V x),
whereas the original CHM equation does not and is therefore unsatisfactory
for plasma physics purposes.

We now rewrite Eq. (3) in a more explicit way [cf. Eq. (1) of Smolyakov

et al.5]

where the characteristic drift-wave scale length ρs ≡ ω−1
ci (Te/mi)1/2 is the
sound speed divided by ωci, and the electron diamagnetic drift b is deﬁned

aEven in the absence of topography, we do not expect Galilean invariance in geophysical
application of the CHM equation, as the β-plane is not an inertial frame. In the plasma
conﬁnement application, a poloidal boost in polar coordinates would also be to a rotating
frame, but the slab approximation implies we should ignore any Coriolis eﬀects and
Galilean invariance in the poloidal direction should apply.
bv∗ ≡ |v∗| is the analogue of β in the geophysical application of the CHM equation.

The ordering in Ref. 11 makes all terms in Eq. (5) of the same order. Thus,
balancing ∂tϕ and ∂tρ2
s ∇2ϕ2 we see that ρs is indeed the characteristic
scale length for spatial ﬂuctations. Balancing ∂tϕ and v∗·∇ϕ we see that
the characteristic time scale is ρs/v∗, and balancing vE and v∗ we see that
the characteristic amplitude of potential ﬂuctuations is (Te/e)ρs/Ln, where
Ln is the scale length for radial variation of n0. We assume ρs/Ln ≪ 1,
so the waves have small amplitudes compared with the thermal potential.
However, kξ, with k a typical ﬂuctuation wavelength, and ξ a typical dis-
placement of a ﬂuid element by the waves, can be order unity, and thus the
equation can describe strong turbulence.

P we can split it into two equations, one

In the MHM case, s = 1, Eq. (8) reduces to Eq. (2) of Ref. 5, ∂t∇2ψ =
−P ˆz×∇ ˜ψ·∇∇2 ˜ψ.

Although physically an approximation, we shall in this paper regard
the CHM/MHM equations as given and treat them as exact equations even
for the mean ﬂow component of ψ, which we assume to vary on longer
and slower length and time scales than assumed in the maximal balance
ordering discussed above.

3. Waves and mean ﬂow

Assuming there is a scale separation between ﬂuctuations and mean ﬂow,
we introduce an averaging operation h·i which ﬁlters out the ﬂuctuating,
wavelike component of whatever it acts on, leaving only a slowly varying
component related to the mean ﬂow. This operation can be realized ex-
plicitly by convolution with a smooth, bell-shaped kernel of width (in time
and space) long compared with the ﬂuctuation scale but short compared
with the mean ﬂow scale. Alternatively we can deﬁne it implicitly via the
test-function formalism introduced in Appendix A of Ref. 22. Either way,

and 6.)

averaging can be shown to commute with ∂t and ∇ to all orders in ǫ, the
ratio of ﬂuctuation scales to mean-ﬂow scales.

We then split ψ into a slowly varying mean ﬂow part, ψ0 ≡ hψi, and a

ﬂuctuating part, ψ1 ≡ ψ − hψi.

Note that, except when the mean ﬂows are purely zonal, h·i is distinct
from the surface averaging operation P · we used to set up the MHM equa-
tion. In this we diﬀer from Champeaux and Diamond9, who, in eﬀect, take
P to be the same as h·i irrespective of the direction of the mean ﬂows.

We consider the case of modulations carried on a coherent wave (see
e.g. Fig. 2), rather than a broad turbulent spectrum.23 (As the CHM and
MHM equations include no drift-wave instability mechanism, the origin
of this wave is outside the theory—it is an initial condition.) Taking, for
simplicity, v∗ to be a global constant we assume the carrier wave (also called
the pump wave in some analyses) to be a plane wave and write

ψ1 = A(r, t) exp(ik·r − ωkt) + c.c. ,

(9)

where A is a slowly varying complex amplitude and c.c. denotes complex
conjugate.

To begin, we take A and the mean ﬂow, hvEi, to be constant and treat
the carrier wave using linear theory. (Nonlinear eﬀects will be discussed in
Sec. 4.) Linearizing Eq. (5) we ﬁnd the dispersion relation in the CHM case

In the latter case, the mean ﬂow causes a simple Doppler shift of frequency,

We shall use the frequency shift due to mean ﬂow to calculate the
nonlinear frequency shift. Otherwise we can ignore it. The group veloc-

scale length of the modulations is O(ǫ−1) compared with the wavelength
of the carrier, then the vg·∇ term on the LHS of Eq. (14) is O(ǫ) whereas
the ∇kvg:∇∇ term on the RHS is smaller, O(ǫ2). Assuming the nonlinear
frequency shift to be of the same order, we see that Eq. (14) expresses the
fact that, on a short time scale, modulations simply advect with the group
velocity, while on a longer timescale the nonlinear frequency shift causes

5. Nonlinear frequency shift

The nonlinear frequency shift ∆ω in a general ﬂuid or plasma is composed
of two parts. The ﬁrst is that due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of the medium
and the second is that due to Doppler-like shifts [see Eqs. (10) and (11)]
associated with nonlinearly induced mean ﬂows.

However, in the case of drift or Rossby waves described by the CHM or
MHM equations, the intrinsic nonlinear frequency shift is zero (or, at most,
of higher order than quadratic). To see this, consider the terms in Eq. (5) de-
scribing nonlinear wave-wave (including self) interactions: {ψ1, ˜ψ1 + δs,0ψ1}

and {ψ1, ∇2ψ1}, where the Poisson bracket of two functions f and g is de-
ﬁned by

{f, g} ≡ ˆz×∇f ·∇g = ∂xf.∂yg − ∂xg.∂yf .

(20)

Since we assume ky 6= 0, ψ1 is zero (to leading order, at least) and
˜ψ1 = ψ1. As the Poisson bracket {f, f } ≡ 0 for any f , the ﬁrst nonlin-
ear self-interaction term vanishes. Similarly, because we are considering a
monochromatic carrier wave, the second self-interaction term also vanishes
to leading order: {ψ1, ∇2ψ1} ≈ −k2{ψ1, ψ1} ≡ 0.

For the calculation of the nonlinearly excited mean ﬂows, we will need
to evaluate the above term more accurately, which is best done via the
useful identity

s K 2). That is, the mean ﬂow,
∝ ˆz×K, is predominantly zonal so we lose no real generality in assuming
K = K ˆx and setting h ˜ψi = 0. Then, using the identity Eq. (21), dividing
s and integrating twice with respect to x we ﬁnd5
Eq. (23) by ρ2

∂tψ0(x, t) = P ∂xψ1.∂yψ1 = 2kxky|A|2 ,

(24)

with the second form following from Eq. (9).

We can convert the time derivative to a spatial derivative by noting that
the RHS of Eq. (14) is small (assuming |A| is small) so, to leading order,
∂tA = −vg·∇A; that is, the modulations move at the group velocity. This

also applies to quantities like ψ0 driven by |A|, so, to leading order, Eq. (24)
becomes

By Eq. (4), vE = ∂xψ0 ˆy, so Eqs. (11) and (12) give the nonlinear frequency

As the nonlinear frequency shift in this case is a simple quadratic func-

ter δωK, Eq. (17), in the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation is now given sim-
ply by δωK = d∆ω/d ln |A| = 2∆ω0. The modulational instability criterion,
Eq. (19), now becomes −ky∂2ωk/∂k2
x < 0. That is, from Eq. (13), the mod-
ulational instability criterion for the modiﬁed Hasegawa–Mima equation
case, s = 1, is

which agrees with Ref. 5 and Ref. 27 but not with Ref. 9 who, due to a
misprint28 reproduced in Ref. 2, omit the factor 3 multiplying ρ2
x. (An
apparently similar inequality to that in Ref. 9 appears in Ref. 7, but this
is not really relevant as they consider only a drift wave propagating in the
poloidal direction—their kx is our Kx.)

If criterion Eq. (27) is fulﬁlled, the growth rate curve, Γ2 vs. K 2, is an

This extends the small-K result in Eq. (15) of Ref. 5 (who use the notation
q for our K) to get a turnover in Γ at large K, as was also found using
a mode-coupling approach by Chen et al.6 via the gyrokinetic equation in
toroidal geometry within the ballooning approximation, and by Lashmore-
Davies et al.8 using the modiﬁed Hasegawa–Mima equation.

As the latter authors base their analysis on the same model as used in
the present paper, we can make a precise comparison between our Eq. (18)
and their modulational dispersion relation, Eq. (43) in the small q ≡ Kx
limit implied by our envelope approach. Expanding their quantities δ± in

δωK = 2∆ω0, with ∆ω0 given by Eq. (26) above. Completing the square in
their Eq. (43), we see that correspondence between the two modulational
dispersion relations is exact in the small q = Kx limit.

Note also that the modulations and zonal ﬂows have ﬁnite frequency,

5.2. Modulational instability for CHM equation

In the unmodiﬁed case, s = 0, there is actually no compelling reason to
make the split into zonal and nonzonal components. Averaging Eq. (5)
over the ﬂuctuation scale (noting that vE·∇ψ ≡ 0 and neglecting small
terms) we ﬁnd

(∂t + v∗·∇)ψ0 = ρ2

s hvE·∇∇2ψ1i = ρ2

s h{ψ1, ∇2ψ1}i .

(29)

Integrating from t = −∞, where ψ0 is assumed to vanish, along the trajec-
tory of a ﬂuid element moving at the drift speed and assuming the modula-
tions in the forcing term on the RHS to be advecting at the group velocity
we ﬁnd

Using the ansatz Eq. (9), the dispersion relation Eq. (10), and the iden-

which gives a modulational dispersion relation in the small Kx limit in
essential agreement with Eq. (19) of Ref. 5, who note that the modulational
instability criterion is the same as that for the MHM, Eq. (27). However, the
resonance at K·(vg −v∗) = 0 arising from the vanishing of the denominator
in Eq. (32) will give higher growth rates for oblique modulations, so it is
not clear that this special case is of great signiﬁcance for Rossby waves in
the absence of boundaries.

6. Conclusions

We have derived a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation for modulations on a
train of drift or Rossby waves in a very universal, if heuristic, fashion. The
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation has been widely studied in other applica-
tions and is known to have soliton solutions. However, we have analyzed
it only for stability to small modulations and have found criteria in agree-
ment with those found by Smolyakov et al.5 for modulation waves with
zonal phase fronts.

Our results are encouraging as a step towards explaining the experi-
mental discovery by Shats and Solomon30 of modulational instability as-
sociated with low-frequency zonal ﬂows, but the Hasegawa–Mima equation
is rather too simpliﬁed for direct comparison with experiment and further
work remains to be done in this regard.

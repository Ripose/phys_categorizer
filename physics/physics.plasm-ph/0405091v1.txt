Eﬃcient Heating of Thin Cylindrical Targets
by Broad Electromagnetic Beams I

In many high-proﬁle applications, such as nuclear fusion and pumping of active media of short-
wavelength lasers, it is necessary to achieve high speciﬁc input of power of an electromagnetic beam in
a target. Diﬀraction sets the lower limit to the transverse dimensions of electromagnetic beams and
represents a fundamental obstacle for electromagnetic heating of small or inaccessible regions. It was
found, however, that it is possible to achieve eﬃcient heating of cylindrical targets by electromagnetic
beams with transverse dimensions that are several orders of magnitude greater than those of the
cylinder. These counter-intuitive results have the following physical mechanism: the absorption in
the cylinder causes a deep fall in the ﬁeld distribution, and this fall causes diﬀractive diﬀusion of
the ﬁeld towards the axis from a large volume of the beam. The heating eﬃciency was rigorously
calculated using the exact solution of the problem of diﬀraction on an inﬁnite homogeneous cylinder
(J.R. Wait, 1955). Several non-resonant domains of parameters were found that provide eﬃcient
absorption of the energy of a broad beam in a thin conducting cylinder. The typical asymptotic
eﬃciency for very thin cylinders is (2-5)/L, where L=ln(w/d), where d is the diameter of the cylinder
and w is the width of the beam waist in the longitudinal geometry or the wavelength in the transverse
geometry. This eﬃciency is high even if the beam is several orders of magnitude broader than the
cylinder. The relevant conditions are not too rigid and may be used to heat cylindrical targets to
high temperatures in a number of important applications. External magnetic ﬁeld may further relax
the conditions of eﬃcient heating.

INTRODUCTION

In many high-proﬁle applications it is necessary to
achieve high speciﬁc input of power of an electromag-
netic beam in a target. No-contact methods are of spe-
cial interest, as the resulting temperatures may be hardly
compatible with any walls. Heating by electromagnetic
waves is the most important of these methods.
It is
used for controlled fusion, for pumping of active media
of short-wavelength lasers, in plasma chemical reactors,
for material processing, and for many other applications.
Diﬀraction sets lower limits to the transverse dimensions
of the electromagnetic beam and thus presents a fun-
damental obstacle for electromagnetic heating of small
or distant regions. One may use shorter wavelengths to
circumvent the diﬀraction constraints, but this is usu-
ally connected with very serious technical diﬃculties and
lower eﬃciency. Another possible way out is multiple-
pass heating of small conducting regions – e.g., in res-
onators or waveguides. But in this case heating is unac-
ceptably slow for many applications, and it is practically
impossible to heat distant regions (e.g., to form an ion-
ized structure in the atmosphere for broadcast or radar).
Non-linear eﬀects, such as self-focusing, may be very im-
portant, but they typically require an electron-density
minimum in the region under heating and/or high beam
intensity.

Thus, in standard geometries of target irradiation, only
one dimension of the region under heating may be much
smaller than the transverse dimensions of the electromag-
netic beam (see Fig. 1). On the other hand, it was found
that in the longitudinal geometry (Fig. 2) and the trans-
verse geometry (Fig. 3), if certain, not too rigid, condi-
tions are met, it is possible to achieve eﬃcient fast heat-
ing of cylindrical targets by electromagnetic beams with
transverse dimensions that are several orders of magni-
tude greater than those of the cylinder (Ref. [1], [2], [3],
[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]). These counter-intuitive results
have the following physical mechanism: the absorption
in the cylinder causes a deep fall in the ﬁeld distribu-
tion, and this fall causes diﬀractive diﬀusion of the ﬁeld

towards the axis from a large volume of the beam. The
eﬀect is linear (for given properties of the cylinder, the
heating eﬃciency does not depend on the beam power)
and scalable (may ﬁnd applications in various frequency
ranges). As these results are rather surprising, much
eﬀort was made to reliably conﬁrm them. For instance,
for the longitudinal geometry, three methods were used:
a qualitative (”back-of-the envelope”) estimate, a semi-
quantitative (”one-wave”) calculation, and a quantitative
calculation, where the Maxwell equations were solved vir-
tually without any approximations. The latter was used
to conﬁrm the results of the semiquantitative approach,
which was used to derive an asymptotic formula for heat-
ing eﬃciency and determine the parameter domains that
provide high eﬃciency.

In the qualitative estimate (Section IV), it is assumed
that the values of the frequency of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and the conductivity of the cylinder are such that
the skin-depth and the diameter of the cylinder are of
the same order of magnitude. Then it is assumed that in

2

this case the refracted electric ﬁeld inside the cylinder has
the same magnitude as the electric ﬁeld in the incident
beam (the electromagnetic ﬁeld penetrates the cylinder
to the skin-depth). Then we obtain that the Joule heating
power is of the same order of magnitude as the power in
the incident beam.

Of course, diﬀraction problems are notorious for strong
dependence on the parameters, and this primitive esti-
mate is often incorrect, but it gives reasonable order-of-
magnitude results in some important cases and demon-
strates the scaling of the problem. For example, if we
reduce the diameter of the cylinder diameter by half,
the optimal conductivity increases fourfold (as the skin-
depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the
conductivity), and the absorbed power remains roughly
the same. Alternatively, if the width of the beam waist
increases twofold, the electric ﬁeld in the cylinder falls
foufold, but the length of the beam waist increases four-
fold, so the absorption eﬃciency does not change.

In the semiquantitative approach, it is assumed that
the refracted electric ﬁeld inside the overlap of the cylin-
der and of the Gaussian beam waist is the same as the
refracted electric ﬁeld for a cylindrical wave that has the
ﬁeld intensity on the axis equal to that in the center of
the Gaussian beam and the width of the ﬁrst maximum
equal to the width of the beam waist. Then the exact so-
lution of the problem of diﬀraction of a cylindrical wave
on an inﬁnite homogeneous cylinder is used (Ref. [10]).

The quantitative calculation was performed as follows:
1. For rigorous calculation of diﬀraction of a Gaus-
sian beam on an inﬁnite homogeneous cylinder, exact
solutions of the free Maxwell equations were found (Sec-
tion II) that are approximated by Gaussian beams with
great accuracy when the beam waist radius is much
greater than the wavelength (if this condition is not ful-
ﬁlled, a Gaussian beam is not a good approximate solu-
tion of the free Maxwell equations). This result may be
important for many applications.

2. For the cylindrical waves, the Wait’s solution was
calculated (in this exact solution of the Maxwell equa-
tions, each cylindrical wave incident on an inﬁnite ho-
mogeneous cylinder generates two reﬂected and two re-
fracted cylindrical waves).

3. The resulting refracted ﬁelds were calculated by
integration of the ﬁelds of the refracted cylindrical waves
using fast Hankel transform.

4. The heating eﬃciency was calculated as a ratio of
the power of the Joule heating in the cylinder (within the
length of the waist of the Gaussian beam) to the power
in the incident free Gaussian beam.

Thus, virtually no approximations were used in this
rigorous calculation. The results of the semiquantitative
approach coincided with those of the rigorous calculation
with 50% accuracy.

Let us describe the structure of this ﬁrst part of the

work.

In Section II, exact solutions of the free Maxwell equa-
tions are described that are approximated by Gaussian

beams with great accuracy when the beam waist radius
is much greater than the wavelength, and their asymp-
totic properties are proved. It is also proven that these
solutions are normalizable.

In Section III, the exact solution of the problem of
diﬀraction of a cylindrical wave on an inﬁnite homoge-
neous cylinder (Ref. [10]) is summarized.

In Section IV, the qualitative and the semiquantitative
approaches are described. In the framework of the lat-
ter, an asymptotic formula for heating eﬃciency in the
longitudinal geometry is derived.

In Section V, an asymptotic formula for heating eﬃ-
ciency in the transverse geometry is derived. This cal-
culation is relatively simple and easy to verify, but has
many common features with the more complex calcula-
tions for the longitudinal geometry.

In Section VI, some conclusions are formulated.
Thus, this ﬁrst part contains considerable technical
material. In the second part, the parameter domains are
determined that provide eﬃcient heating in the longitu-
dinal geometry. The relevant conditions were formulated
in part in Ref. [6], [7]; they reﬁne and generalize the
results of Ref. [1]. The conditions are conﬁrmed by rig-
orous calculation, and some applications are discussed in
the second part.

II. EXACT SOLUTIONS OF THE FREE
MAXWELL EQUATIONS AND GAUSSIAN
BEAMS

It is highly desirable to validate the results of the
present paper through comparison with exact solutions
of the Maxwell equations. However, Gaussian beams are
just approximations to exact solutions of free Maxwell
equations. So in this section the author informally de-
rives some exact solutions of the free Maxwell equations
and proves that Gaussian beams approximate them with
high accuracy. These solutions were found in Ref. [8].
In Ref. [11], drawbacks of the earlier approaches to this
problem are discussed, and other beam-like solutions of
the free Maxwell equations are found.

We consider a monochromatic beam with frequency
ω and use such a system of units that the wave vector
in free space k0 = ω
c = 1. Solutions of the Maxwell
equations in homogeneous media with permittivity ε and
magnetic permeability µ are described by the electric and
magnetic Hertz vectors Π and Π′. The Hertz vectors
satisfy equations:

In free space ε = µ = 1. To emulate a Gaussian electro-

It should be noted that, for the sake of simplicity, some
conventions are used here, so, the actual electric and
magnetic ﬁelds are equal to the real parts of the prod-
ucts of the expressions in Eqs. (7) and (8) by the time-
iωt). Let us write the Fourier

to modify these expressions. The Fourier expansions sug-
gest that the ﬁelds may be constructed as a superposition
of plane waves. Let us consider a plane electromagnetic
wave with a wave vector
– it propagates in the
direction z. To obtain a plane wave with a wave vector

Now let us prove that the solution of the free Maxwell
equations (Eq. (22)) is normalizable, i.e.
integrals of
products of any two ﬁeld components (such as EφHρ, E2
ρ
etc.) over any transverse section z = const are ﬁnite, so
energy ﬂow through a transverse section and total elec-

tromagnetic energy between two transverse sections are
ﬁnite. It may be seen from Eq. (22) that all ﬁeld compo-
nents are continuous, so it is suﬃcient to prove that for
any z ﬁeld components are O(ρ− 3
2 ) for large ρ. Eq. (37)
implies that it is suﬃcient to prove this for components
of electric ﬁeld. We obtain from Eq. (65):

J. Wait Ref. [10], so let us outline it here. Let us consider
cylindrical waves of TM type:

where Fn = exp(i(γz + nϕ)). Then the reﬂected ﬁeld
is also a linear combination of cylindrical TM and TE

IV. THE CONDITIONS OF EFFICIENT
ABSORPTION OF A BROAD GAUSSIAN
ELECTROMAGNETIC BEAM IN A THIN
CONDUCTING CYLINDER

Diﬀraction problems are often highly sensitive to vari-
ations of their parameters. Therefore, conﬁrmation of
the results of any calculations by rigorous solution of
Maxwell equations is highly desirable, and this proce-
dure is discussed in the next section. However, one also
needs simpler approximate procedures to make estimates
and to determine the most promising parameter domains.
Therefore, in this section the author describes a sim-
ple (and sometimes inaccurate) qualitative estimate of

the part of the power of a Gaussian beam absorbed in
a conducting cylinder and a semiquantitative one-wave
method. The latter is used to deduce an asymptotic for-
mula for eﬃciency of the absorption and to determine
the parameter domains where eﬃcient absorption takes
place. The results of the semiquantitative methods were
conﬁrmed by rigorous solution of the Maxwell equation.
This section mostly deals with the longitudinal geome-
try, as for this geometry conditions of eﬃcient absorp-
tion of a broad beam in a thin cylinder were not known,
so the author investigates this case in much detail. For
the transverse geometry some resonant cases of eﬃcient
absorption were known (see, eg.,Ref. [13]), so the author
describes just one non-resonant parameter domain where

eﬃcient absorption takes place in a cylinder with a ra-
dius that is much less than the wavelength. This result is
important as it complements the results for the longitudi-
nal geometry. To describe the qualitative estimate for the
longitudinal geometry, let us consider a Gaussian beam
of electromagnetic waves with frequency ω in free space.
Let the length of the conducting cylinder be greater than
the beam waist length l1 deﬁned by twofold ﬁeld inten-
sity attenuation, its radius a be (much) less than that of
the beam waist r1 deﬁned by e-fold ﬁeld intensity attenu-
ation, and its conductivity σ be such that the skin-depth
be roughly equal to the cylinder diameter:

4a2 =

c2
2πωσ

.

(102)

Let us place the cylinder in the beam in such a way that
the axes of the cylinder and the beam coincide, and the
cylinder overlap the whole beam waist length. Let us as-
sume that the electric ﬁeld within the cylinder is equal
in absolute value to that in the incident wave, i.e. that
in the absence of the cylinder (the ﬁeld penetrates the
conducting medium to skin-depth). In general, this as-
sumption is wrong and cannot be defended. However,
in some important cases it does hold true and allows to
obtain a simple estimate and understand the scaling of
the problem. Let us also assume that within the beam
waist the electric ﬁeld in the incident wave is equal in
absolute value to that in the center of the beam waist E
(this assumption cannot lead to additional overvaluation
by more than e times). The beam power equals

Here S1 is the area of the transverse section of the beam
waist, and
is the averaged Poynting vector in the
beam waist. The power absorbed in the cylinder equals

(105)

length for the Gaussian beam
is the beam waist
(Ref. [14]). Thus, the absorption eﬃciency Wa
W equals
unity to the order of magnitude. One can see that if
the beam waist width increases twofold, the electric ﬁeld
in the cylinder falls fourfold (if beam power does not
change), but the beam waist length increases fourfold,
so the absorption eﬃciency does not change. Alterna-
tively, if we use a cylinder with the radius that is half
as large, the optimum conductivity increases fourfold, so
in this case the absorption eﬃciency does not change,
either. However, this estimate calculation is not always
correct, so let us describe a semiquantitative method of
calculation of the absorption eﬃciency. This is actually

12

(106)

(107)

(108)

(109)

(110)

(111)

(112)

a one-wave approximation. The idea is as follows. Any
incident beam can be expanded in cylindrical waves (see
Eqs. (78) and (79)). For each cylindrical wave there is a
relatively simple exact solution of the problem of diﬀrac-
tion on an inﬁnite cylinder. Let us choose a typical cylin-
drical wave from the expansion. Its ﬁeld on the axis will
have a structure similar to that of the incident beam. We
may then assume that for the incident beam within the
beam waist length the refracted wave coincides with that
for the chosen cylindrical wave (the latter should be nor-
malized in such a way that the magnitudes of the ﬁelds
in the incident beam and in this wave are approximately
equal). So let us assume that the actual incident, re-
ﬂected, and refracted ﬁelds may be approximated within
the beam waist by Eqs. (81),(82), and (83), correspond-
ingly. We further assume that subscript n = 1 (otherwise
there is no eﬃcient absorption in the longitudinal geome-
1, which is true for cylindrical waves
try, at least if λ1 ≪
that have a ﬁeld structure similar to that in the waist of
Gaussian beams), and this subscript will be omitted. Let
us choose

λ1 ≈

2
r1

,

so that the width of the Gaussian beam waist is approxi-
mately equal to the width of the main maximum of func-
tion J0(λ1ρ). We are interested in analytical conditions
of eﬃcient absorption of broad beams in thin cylinders,
so we make the following assumptions:

in the center of the beam waist (ρ = 0, z = 0) are the

To estimate the energy ﬂow through the surface of the
cylinder within the beam waist, we should multiply the
Poynting vector of Eq. (121) by the area of the lateral
surface of the cylinder:

2πal1

(127)

±

We neglect the energy ﬂow through the sections of the
l1
cylinder at z =
2 , as in view of Eqs. (105),(106)
it is much less than the power in the incident beam
(Eq. (121)). The power absorbed in the cylinder W a
equals the energy ﬂow through the surface of the cylin-
der with an opposite sign (as positive ρ-component of the
Poynting vector corresponds to outward energy ﬂow):

This assumption may seem unrealistic, as it means that
the radius of the cylinder is several orders of magnitude
less than the radius of the beam waist. However, this as-
sumption allows to derive asymptotic formulae that give
very useful guidelines for more realistic cases. It seems
worthwhile to analyze the case of extremely thin cylin-
ders, as they are more diﬃcult to heat. Thus, let us use
the following expansions for the Hankel functions with
small arguments:

We further assume that the absolute value of the term

p2

of the same order of magnitude as the absolute values
of the two other terms. As D enters the denominator
of Eq. (128), we may now neglect the two lesser terms:
for any domain of parameters providing high absorption
eﬃciency that we may ﬁnd in this way, the assumption
will ensure high absorption eﬃciency after we take into
account the two neglected terms. On the whole, our as-
sumptions may be loosely deﬁned in the following way:
p1 (which is proportional to the ratio of the radii of the
cylinder and the beam waist) is ”much less than any other
parameter of the problem”. Thus, we obtain

V. EFFICIENT HEATING IN THE
TRANSVERSE GEOMETRY

Let us now consider the transverse geometry, where
a cylindrical electromagnetic wave converges on a thin
conducting cylinder. The general solution of Section III
may be used in this case with β = 0, n = 0, γ = 0, but
this relatively simple case is worth direct consideration,

(144)

η =

as it is easier to verify, and it is more natural to choose
the incident TM wave using the Hankel function of the
second kind rather than the Bessel function, as the inci-
dent wave propagates in the radial direction (towards the
axis) rather than along the axis. Converging TE waves
are not considered here, as they do not provide eﬃcient
heating in the relevant parameter domain.

Again, the actual electric and magnetic ﬁelds are equal
to the real parts of the products of the above expressions
by the time-dependent factor exp(
iωt). A diverging
reﬂected cylindrical wave propagates from the cylinder

lowing results:

It is evident that the heating eﬃciency decreases ex-
tremely slowly when the radius of the cylinder decreases
by many orders of magnitude, if in the same time the
conductivity of the cylinder increases to satisfy the opti-
mality condition (Eq. (157)). In this case the eﬃciency
40%. Moreover, the condition of
typically equals 20
high eﬃciency is not resonant, as the width of the maxi-
mum corresponds to variation of conductivity by an order
of magnitude (at the level of over 50% of the maximum).
It should also be noted that Eq. (157) is compatible

÷

with the approximations (Eq. (152)).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

A rigorous analysis of a diﬀraction problem demon-
strates that it is possible to achieve eﬃcient heating of
cylindrical targets by electromagnetic beams with trans-
verse dimensions that are several orders of magnitude

17

greater than those of the cylinder. The relevant condi-
tions are not too rigid.

This is the ﬁrst part of the work. It contains the fol-

Exact solutions of the free Maxwell equations are de-
scribed that are approximated by Gaussian beams with
great accuracy when the beam waist radius is much
greater than the wavelength, and their asymptotic prop-
erties are proved. It is also proven that these solutions
are normalizable. These results may be useful for many
applications.

The qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative ap-
proaches are developed for calculation of eﬃciency of
heating of cylindrical targets with broad electromagnetic
beams. The quantitative approach includes rigorous so-
lution of the Maxwell equations.

Asymptotic formulae for heating eﬃciency in the lon-

gitudinal and transverse geometry are derived.

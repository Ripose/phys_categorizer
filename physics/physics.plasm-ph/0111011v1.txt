In this paper, the evolution of the induced axial magnetization due to the propagation of an EM-
wave along the static background magnetic ﬁeld in a two-component plasma has been investigated
using the Block equation. The evolution process induces a strong magnetic anisotropy in the plasma
medium, depending non-linearly on the incident wave amplitude. This induced magnetic anisotropy
can modify the dispersion relation of the incident EM-wave, which has been obtained in this paper.
In the low frequency Alfven wave limit, this dispersion relation shows that the resulting phase
velocity of the incident wave depends on the square of the incident wave amplitude and on the
static background magnetic ﬁeld of plasma. The analytical results are in well agreement with the
numerically estimated values in solar corona and sunspots.

I. INTRODUCTION

The investigation of the propagation of electromagnetic waves is a long studied subject of plasma physics ( see [1]
and references therein). In the traditional approach one studies low amplitude waves propagating in an uncorrelated
plasma. Important information on the properties of plasmas in the linear response regime can be obtained from the
knowledge of the dielectric tensor. The dielectric function of a magnetized uncorrelated plasma has been extensively
studied by Horing [2]. The dispersion of low amplitude waves or the interaction of low intensity particle beams with
plasmas may be studied by employing the dielectric function. Recently, the stopping power of an uncorrelated plasma
has been investigated [3]. There have been two basic lines beyond the traditional investigations of electromagnetic
modes propagation. One line considers the inﬂuence of correlation eﬀects on the plasma dispersion relations. Recent
papers are devoted to the study of the dielectric tensor of correlated magnetized plasmas and to the investigation of
the electromagnetic mode dispersion in coupled magnetized plasmas [4,5]. The other line is aimed at the investigation
of nonlinear eﬀects in uncorrelated plasmas. A growing number of papers is dedicated to the study of the propagation
of intense radiation in plasmas (recent works are cited in [6]).

One of the important area in these investigations is the generation of magnetic ﬁelds under the inﬂuence of elec-
tromagnetic (EM) waves [7]. One of the sources of the generation of induced magnetization is the inverse Faraday
eﬀect (IFE). The induced magnetization from IFE due to propagation of several waves in plasma, has been previously
investigated (see Ref. [8–12] and references therein). This phenomenon arises from magnetic moment per unit volume
of the ordered motion of charges of both signs, in the presence of an electromagnetic wave propagating in plasma
[7,13]. This induced ﬁeld must have axial as well as lateral component depending on the nature of the wave-wave
and wave- particle interactions. For an elliptically polarized Alfven wave propagating along the static back ground
magnetic ﬁeld in a two component plasma, this induced magnetization were found to be inversely proportional to the
cube of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld and the square of the incident wave amplitude, and acts in the direction of the
incident wave propagation. Such eﬀects are expected to be signiﬁcant in the study of various processes in the sun and
other stars, including pulsars. This eﬀect may be demonstrated in laboratory plasmas.

In this paper, it has been shown that the zero harmonic magnetic moment generated from an elliptically polarized
EM-wave along the direction of its propagation induces strong dc magnetic permeability depending non-linearly on the
incident wave amplitude and acts in the same direction as the induced magnetization. Moreover, a small perturbation
of the self-generated zero harmonic magnetic moment starts to evolve. This evolution can be investigated by using
Block equation model [14].In this paper this evolution has been studied and it has been shown that it induces strong
magnetic anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the incident wave propagation. This induced
magnetic anisotropy is evident from the existence of non-vanishing oﬀ-diagonal elements of the magnetic permeability
tensor, which also depend non-linearly on the incident wave amplitude.

In general plasma medium is not a magnetic material. However, the propagation of an incident EM wave in a plasma
generates a self generated uniform magnetization ~Ma which induces a strong magnetic permeability in the plasma
medium depending nonlinearly on the incident wave amplitude. As magnetic permeability of a ferromagnet is very
large, we can assume our resulting plasma medium as a weakly ferromagnetic medium in which magnetic permeability
is large but not as large as for a ferromagnetic material medium. The self generated uniform magnetization may be
considered as the ground state magnetization. Since we have considered long wave length excitations, a continuum
theory is appropriate to study the evolution of small perturbation in the ground state magnetization.

Thus a weak ferromagnetic behavior of plasma is expected which can change the orientation of the bulk magne-
tization of the plasma that can reduce the mobility of electrons and ions and as a result the displacement current
dominates over the conduction current [14]. This eﬀect modiﬁes the dispersion characteristics of the incident EM-
wave. The dispersion relation of the incident EM-wave in the resulting plasma medium has been obtained in this
paper. In the low frequency Alfven wave limit, it has been seen that the phase velocity of the incident Alfven wave
in the resulting plasma medium depends on the static back-ground magnetic ﬁeld of the plasma as well as on the
square of the incident wave amplitude. As the induced magnetization is directly proportional to the square of the
incident wave amplitude, the increase in the wave amplitude causes to increase the induced IFE magnetization. This
pronounces the induced magnetic anisotropy, and ultimately inhibits the Alfven wave propagation in the resulting
plasma medium. These results have been veriﬁed numerically both in the Solar corona and Sunspots.

On the basis of this mechanism many authors have already developed a new mechanism of stabilization of stimulated
Brillouin scattering (SBS) in laser produced plasmas, which is a consequence of the self-generated magnetic ﬁeld in the
SBS process [11,15]. In that case, a temporally exponentially growing zero harmonic magnetic ﬁeld was generated in
both axial and lateral directions. The lateral magnetic ﬁeld was found to be responsible for the initiation of magnetic
anisotropy in the plasma medium, which can exponentially reduce the phase velocities of incident and scattered light
waves. However, for an elliptically polarized EM-wave propagating parallel to the static back- ground magnetic ﬁeld,
a zero harmonic induced axial magnetization is only generated. This axial magnetization in the ground state cannot
induce magnetic anisotropy. The evolution of its linear perturbation induces magnetic anisotropy in the plasma
medium, which has been investigated in this paper by using Block equation model.

In section 2, the dc magnetic permeability induced by the self-generated axial magnetic moment has been obtained.
Its evolution has been studied in section 3. The eﬀect of this evolution on the incident EM-wave is investigated
in section 4. Section 5 describes these results in the low frequency Alfven wave limit. Calculation of the magnetic
moment induced by the Alfven wave is given in the Appendix. Numerical estimation has been followed by discussion
cited in section 6.

II. DC MAGNETIC PERMEABILITY INDUCED BY SELF-GENERATED AXIAL MAGNETIC
MOMENT

In the classical approximation, the bulk magnetization present in a magnetic material should be due to orbital
angular momentum of charges, because of the distortion of orbital motion under the inference of EM ﬁelds [8–12,7,13].
When an EM wave propagates along the static background magnetic ﬁeld, in a two component plasma, the magnetic
moment is generated from the Inverse Faraday eﬀect (IFE) mechanism along the z-direction,

which has been presented in the Appendix . This magnetic moment can be expressed in the form

~M0 = M0~z ,

~M0 = (M0x, M0y, M0z) ,

where M0x = 0, M0y = 0, and

This shows that the zero harmonic magnetic moment ~M0 = M0z~z induces a strong dc magnetic permeability µ0z
depending nonlinearly on the incident wave amplitude and in the z-direction. Thus the resulting plasma medium
behaves as a ferromagnetic medium with the IFE magnetization as the ground state magnetization.
In the next
section, the dynamics of this self-generated axial IFE magnetization will be studied.

III. EVOLUTION OF SELF-GENERATED AXIAL MAGNETIC MOMENT IN A WEAKLY
FERRO-MAGNETIC MEDIUM

From a macroscopic point of view, we may consider the ferromagnetic media as continua characterized by a magnetic
moment density called magnetization. The ground state of a ferromagnet is of uniform magnetization at absolute
zero temperature. A small disturbance in this magnetization will propagate in such a medium and this propagation
can be studied by Block equation model [10],

where ~M is the bulk magnetization and ~Hef f is the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld in the medium , γ is the charge to mass
ratio and c is the velocity of light in vacuum.

The propagation of an elliptically polarized EM wave in a two component magnetized plasma induces a zero
harmonic axial magnetic moment from IFE, which generates a nonlinear magnetic permeability in the same direction.
The plasma behaves as a weakly ferromagnetic medium and the induced magnetic moment ~M0 acts as its bulk
magnetization. This bulk magnetization is immediately perturbed and the resulting magnetization follows the equation

where s=e(electron)/i(ion) and the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld ~Hef f is the sum of the background magnetic ﬁeld ~H0 and
the 1st harmonic magnetic ﬁeld ~H1 of the incident em wave. Thus, we have

From (19) and (20) we obtain the coupled diﬀerential equations,

Since H1x, H1y are the x and y components of the magnetic ﬁeld ~H1 of the incident EM wave, propagating along the

It is seen from the expression (33) and (34) that µxx and µxy depend on the square of the incident wave amplitude.
The nonvanishing oﬀ-diagonal elements µxy and µyx indicate that a strong magnetic anisotropy is developed in the
xy-plane, perpendicular to the direction of incident wave propagation (along the z-direction). This anisotropy is
exclusively due to the evolution of the perturbation ~M1 in a plasma medium, having weakly ferromagnetic properties.

IV. EFFECT OF MAGNETIC ANISOTROPY ON THE INCIDENT EM WAVE PROPAGATION

As we are studying magnetic moment dynamics in the plasma medium under the action of long range coulomb
forces between the charge particles, classical theory is more appropriate than quantum mechanical theory because
any disturbance propagates through a plasma medium with a wave length much greater than the atomic distances.

In this section we shall investigate how this induced magnetic anisotropy changes the dispersion characteristics of

the incident elliptically polarized EM wave.

The induced magnetic anisotropy reduces the mobility of the charge particles. Hence the conduction current becomes
negligible and the displacement current dominates over conduction current. Thus in such an insulated ferromagnet,
the propagation of an EM wave obeys the following Maxwell equations

where ˆǫ, ˆµ are respectively the dielectric tensor and magnetic permeability tensor of the resulting plasma medium, ˆµ

Since the electric ﬁeld E1x, E1y and magnetic ﬁeld H1x, H1y of the incident electromagnetic wave contain the phase

which is the modiﬁed dispersion relation of the incident EM wave in the anisotropic plasma medium. Substitution of

where n = kc/ω is the refractive index of the resulting plasma medium. This dispersion relation shows that the
dispersion characteristics of the incident EM wave depend on the product of the incident EM wave amplitude. In the
next section we shall investigate such characteristics for the case of Alfven waves.

V. ALFVEN WAVE APPROXIMATION

If the incident EM wave propagating in a two component plasma along the static background magnetic ﬁeld is an

Alfven wave, the wave frequency satisﬁes the condition

ω ≪ Ωe, Ωi .

the case of a low amplitude wave, a, b → 0, we obtain from Eq. (45) the dispersion relation of the ordinary Alfven
wave with only one branch. Consider the modiﬁcations of wave propagation caused by the nonlinearity. First, the
nonlinearity produces a splitting of the Alfven branch into two branches corresponding to the left elliptically polarized
(a and b of equal sign) or to the right elliptically polarized Alfven wave (a and b of diﬀerent sign), respectively. Second,

VI. NUMERICAL ESTIMATION

In the solar corona, the ambient magnetic ﬁeld is, H0 = 10−2G and the plasma mass density is, ρ = 10−16g/cm3.
Hence the Alfven speed in a solar corona is cA = 2.75 × 105cm/sec. If an Alfven wave of amplitude a = 10−8esu
propagates in the solar corona, the induced magnetic ﬁeld would be of the order of 10−4G and the phase velocity of
the incident wave in the resulting anisotropic plasma medium is very large but ﬁnite. This implies that only very
long wave length waves can propagate in such a medium. For an incident wave amplitude a = 10−7esu, the induced
magnetization is 10−2G and the wave phase velocity ω/k becomes inﬁnite. Moreover, if the incident wave amplitude
increases to a value 10−6esu, the induced magnetization becomes 1.13G and the phase velocity of the incident wave
becomes imaginary and no further wave propagation is possible. The refractive index of nonlinear circular polarized
Alfven wave with amplitude a = b and propagating in the solar corona is shown in Fig. 1. With increasing wave
amplitude the refractive indices of both nonlinear Alfven brunches decrease. The ﬁrst brunch (n2
+) has its cutoﬀ at
an amplitude a = 5.3 · 10−8esu, whereas the second brunch ranges up to an amplitude of a = 9.1 · 10−8esu.

Similar results have also been obtained in sunspots, where H0 = 3000G, mass density ρ = 10−5g/cm3 and Alfven
In that case for a = 10−2esu, H in = 420G and ω/k is very large but ﬁnite. For

speed cA = 2.7 × 105cm/sec.
a = 10−1.5esu, H in becomes 4200G and ω/k is inﬁnite, and for a = 10−1esu, H in = 4.2 × 104G, ω/k is imaginary.

These numerical results conﬁrm that the increase in the incident wave amplitude produces a magnetic anisotropy via
the increasing induced magnetization in the plasma medium and consequently inhibits the Alfven wave propagation.

VII. DISCUSSION

From the results so far obtained in this paper, it is evident that for a strong EM wave propagating along the static
back ground magnetic ﬁeld in a two component plasma, the self generated zero harmonic axial magnetic moment starts
to evolve. This evolution induces a strong magnetic anisotropy in the plasma medium and the medium consequently
behaves as a weakly ferromagnetic medium with the zero harmonic magnetization as the ground state magnetization.
This anisotropy inhibits the incident wave propagation in the resulting plasma medium. Moreover, as the wave
amplitude increases, the anisotropy becomes strong and absorption of the wave by the medium is pronounced.

Let the ﬁrst order electric ﬁeld of the em wave that induces the perturbation in the plasma model be

where ~z being the direction of propagation of the em wave. Substitution of (A5) in (A11) gives

where n = kc/ω is the refractive index of plasma, ω and k are the frequency and wave number of the incident em
wave. Solution of the linearized set of equations (A9,A10,A11,A12,A13,A14) with the help of (A15) and (A16) gives
the ﬁrst order perturbed velocity of the charged particles ~us1, induced by the ﬁrst order transverse em wave

After integrating (A18) and (A19), we obtain the ﬁrst order wave induced displacement of the charge particles

Hence the magnetic moment induced by the electrons and ion motion under the inﬂuence of the incident EM wave is

where

where

where (αs, βs) = qs(a, b)/msωc, Ys = Ωs/ω, Ωs = qsH0/msc. Here qs and ms are charge and mass of the sth species
of charge particles.

This is the induced magnetization from IFE generated from the distortion of the ordered motion of charge particles
under the inﬂuence of incident EM wave. Eq. (A24) shows that this induced magnetic moment acts along the z-
direction which is the direction of the incident wave propagation. This is the ground state magnetization ~M = ~M0 of
the weakly ferromagnetic medium as discussed in this paper. Hence the induced magnetization ~H in is

Substituting (A24) and (A25) in (A26), we obtain

During the last three decades, photon rest mass prob-
lem captured special attention of many investigators who
have reported several experimental upper limits on the
photon mass by using various methods [1–6]. More re-
cently, Luo et al. obtained the most new upper limit on
photon rest mass of 1.2 × 10−54 Kg by means of rotating
torsion balance experiment [7]. Although Luo et al.’s ex-
periment is excellent, here we have a supplement to their
result, since our evaluation shows that the photon eﬀec-
tive rest mass due to the self-induced charge currents [8]
in the environmental dilute plasma (e.g., the muon com-
ponent and other charged particles in secondary cosmic
ray ﬂux) is just the same order of magnitude [9] as Luo’s
obtained upper limit on photon mass.

It is known that at the sea level, the current density
of muon component in secondary cosmic rays is about
1 × 10−2cm−2 · s−1. Assuming that the muon velocity
approaches speed of light, the volume density of muon
can be derived and the result is Nµ = 0.3 × 10−6 m−3.
So, according to the photon eﬀective rest mass formula
2Nµe2
meﬀ = ¯h
ǫ0mµc2 [9] with mµ, ¯h, c and ǫ0 denoting the
muon mass, Planck’s constant, speed of light and electric
permittivity in a vacuum, respectively, electromagnetic
wave with wavelength λ ≫ 100 m at the sea level acquires
an eﬀective rest mass about 0.3 × 10−53 Kg. Hence the
ambient cosmic magnetic vector potentials (interstellar
magnetic ﬁelds) with low or zero frequencies will truly
acquire this eﬀective rest mass.

Note that the above-mentioned muon volume density
(0.3 × 10−6 m−3) is only the datum at the sea level. In
order to evaluate the muon volume density in the envi-
ronment where Luo’s experiment was performed, readers
may be referred to the following handbook data of muon
current density in underground cosmic rays: the muon
current densities are respectively 10−4 cm−2 · s−1 and
10−6 cm−2 · s−1 at the equivalent water depths of 100 m
and 1000 m under the ground. In Luo’s experiment, the
total apparatus is located in a cave laboratory, on which
the least thickness of the cover is more than 40 m [7]. It is
reasonably believed that the muon density of secondary
cosmic rays in the vacuum chamber of Luo’s experiment
may be one or two orders of magnitude less than that at

the sea level. This, therefore, means that the eﬀective
rest mass acquired by photons in Luo’s vacuum chamber
may be about (0.3 ∼ 1) × 10−54 Kg.

It is believed that the air molecules in the low-pressure
vacuum chamber of torsion balance experiment cannot
be easily ionized by the alpha-particles, electrons and
protons of cosmic rays, because, for example, it is readily
veriﬁed that the mean free path of alpha-particle moving
at about 107m · s−1 in the dilute air with the pressure
being only 10−2 Pa [7] is too large (i.e., more than 106
m) [9]. So, the air medium in the low-pressure vacuum
chamber has nothing to contribute to the eﬀective rest
mass of photons. However, as far as the alpha-particles,
π mesons, electrons, etc.
in secondary cosmic rays are
concerned, it follows that these ions will also contribute
10−54 Kg or so to photon eﬀective mass, since their total
volume density in Luo’s cave laboratory is about only
one order of magnitude less than that of muon.

Thus the photon eﬀective rest mass resulting from both
muons and other ions in secondary cosmic rays can be
compared to the newly obtained upper limit (1.2 × 10−54
Kg) by Luo et al. in their recent rotating torsion balance
experiment [7]. For this reason, now Luo’s experimental
upper limit on photon mass becomes just an interesting
critical value. We think Luo’s recent result is of physi-
cal interest but it still deserves further experimental in-
vestigation so as to improve the present upper limit on
photon mass. It is claimed that, in the near future, only
the contribution of ions in secondary cosmic rays is ruled
out, can we deal better with the experiment schemes of
photon rest mass and related experimental results.

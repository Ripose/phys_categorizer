Weak magnetohydrodynamic turbulence of magnetized plasma

E.A.Kuznetsov∗
Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, 2 Kosygin str., 117334 Moscow, Russia

Weak turbulence of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in strongly magnetized plasma is stud-
ied when the plasma pressure is less than the magnetic ﬁeld pressure. In this situation the main
nonlinear mechanism is the resonance scattering of fast magneto-acoustic and Alfvenic waves on
slow magneto-acoustic waves. As a result, the former waves serve as the high-frequency waves with
respect to the latter ones so that the total number of HF waves - an adiabatic invariant - conserves
additionally.
In the weak turbulence regime this invariant is shown to generate the Kolmogorov
type spectrum with a constant ﬂux of HF waves towards large-scale region. In the short-wave re-
gion another Kolmogorov spectrum can be realized with a constant energy ﬂux. The explicit angle
dependences for both types of turbulent spectra are found for the propagation angles close to the
direction of a mean magnetic ﬁeld.

I. INTRODUCTION

The central place in theory of turbulence occupies the notion of spectrum of turbulence – the energy distribution
on scales. The problem of its ﬁnding is one of the most diﬃcult and nowdays is far from the complete solution.
For developed hydrodynamic turbulence the pioneering works of A.N.Kolmogorov [1] and A.M.Obukhov [2] of 1941
about self-similar nature of turbulent spectra determined development of theory of turbulence for many years. In the
seventieth years mainly by the eﬀorts of V.E.Zakharov the Kolmogorov-Obukhov ideas were fruitfully applied to the
weak wave turbulence theory (for details, see monograph [3] and also the ﬁrst papers devoted to this subject [4–6]).
Wave turbulence in some sense occurred to be simpler than developed hydrodynamic turbulence. The main reason
of such simplicity is connected with the wave dispersion when there exists such a region of wave intensities when
the nonlinear interaction between waves can be considered weak in comparison with dispersive eﬀects. If initially
phases of waves are distributed randomly then the nonlinear interaction can provide a weak correlation in phases of
the interacting waves. By this reason such ensemble of waves can be described in terms of pare correlation functions
the Fourier spectra of which coincide, up to the multiplier, with a number of waves nk (occupation number) with
the deﬁnite wave vector k.
In their turn, the occupation numbers nk obey the kinetic equations for waves. The
Kolmogorov spectra in this theory arise as stationary scale-invariant solutions of the kinetic equations annulating
their collision terms. These spectra, unlike the thermodynamic equilibrium ones, can be related to the solutions
with nonzero ﬂuxes over scales. They realize a constant ﬂux over scales of some integral of motion: energy, number
of waves, etc., in the so-called inertial interval. It is important that if for developed hydrodynamic turbulence the
notion of the inertial interval – the region where inﬂuence of both pumping and dissipation can be neglected – in fact
represents the hypothesis of locality, for the weak turbulence theory this property can be checked explicitly.

It is necessary to note that the main mass of works devoted to the Kolmogorov spectra of weak turbulence consider
isotopic media (the corresponding bibliography can be found in [3]). Inﬂuence of anisotropy, for instance, magnetic ﬁeld
in plasma, has been studied in the less extent. The ﬁrst such example of Kolmogorov type spectra was considered by
the author in 1972 [8] for weak turbulence of magnetized ion-acoustic waves in plasma. For this case the collision term
of the kinetic equation was shown to be invariant with respect to two independent scalings along and perpendicular the
magnetic ﬁeld that allowed, by means of generalization of the Zakharov transformation, to construct the Kolmogorov
spectra with the power dependences relative to longitudinal (kz) and transverse (k⊥) components of the wave vector.
Later, the ideas of these papers were used for ﬁnding Kolmogorov spectra for drift waves in plasma and for the Rossby
waves (see, for instance, [9,10]).

The present paper is devoted to weak turbulence of magneto-hydrodynamic waves in strongly magnetized plasma

when the thermal pressure of plasma nT is small compared with the magnetic ﬁeld pressure H 2/(8π) (β = 8πnT /H 2
≪
1). In this case, in comparison with [4], [8], turbulent spectra are deﬁned from solution of three linked kinetic equations
for Alfvenic, fast and slow magneto-acoustic waves.

For β

1 the main nonlinear mechanism of the MHD waves is a scattering of fast magneto-acoustic and Alfvenic
waves on slow magneto-acoustic waves (Section 2). In these processes, which can be considered as a partial case of

decays of one wave to two another waves and the oppsite process of fusion, Alfvenic and fast magneto-acoustic waves
play a role of high-frequency waves against slow magneto-acoustic waves. In each act of scattering the frequency change
of the former waves (we will call them A-waves) is small enough, due to smallness of the parameter β. By this reason
this process is familiar to the Mandelstamm-Brillouin scattering - scattering of electromagnetic waves on acoustic
phonons. According to separation in time scales - devision of all waves onto HF and LF waves - the decay interaction
conserves, besides the energy, the adiabatic invariant – the total number of HF waves. However, this analogy with the
Mandelstamm-Brillouin scattering has not been exhausted by the said above. It turns out that the matrix element of
this interaction has maximum for the maximal value of longitudinal projection of momentum transfered by A-waves
to slow magneto-acoustic waves. In particular, this result can be extracted from the expression for the growth rate
of decay instability for the monochromatic Alfvenic wave obtained in 1962 by A.A.Galeev and V.N.Oraevskii [22].
Remind that for the Mandelstamm-Brillouin scattering the matrix element is also proportional to square root from the
value of transferred momentum, that provides maximum for the back scattering of electromagnetic waves. Because
of such behavior of the scattering amplitude of A-waves it is natural to assume that a stationary distribution of
waves over angles will be very anisotropic, concentrated in the k-space along the magnetic ﬁeld direction. Under such
assumptions the kinetic equations possess two additional symmetries – invariance with respect to two independent
stretching along and in transverse direction to the mean magnetic ﬁeld that allow one to use the transformations of
the paper [8]. Due to two these symmetries of the kinetic equations it turns out that in the transparency region there
are possible two scale-invariant (against longitudinal and transverse wave vectors) Kolmogorov spectra corresponding
to a constant ﬂux of energy to the short-wave region - the direct cascade and to a constant ﬂux of A-waves towards
the large-scale region - the inverse cascade. This paper is based on the old results of the author [13] published in the
form of preprint in Russian and unknown by this reason abroad (that is natural). But it turns out that these results
are also unknown for Russian readers. In spite of more than twenty ﬁve years history nobody has not repeated these
results. It is necessary to note, however, that recently the question about MHD turbulence has been considered in
1
another limit β
plasma can be considered as almost incompressible ﬂuid and, secondly, in this limit there is no essential diﬀerence
between Alfvenic and slow magneto-acoustic waves: the latter waves have the same dispersion law as Alfvenic waves
diﬀering from them by polarization only. Such degeneracy suﬃciently changes the character of nonlinear interaction.
In spite of these facts in this situation two kinds of Kolmogorov spectra are possible with the same dependences on
wave numbers as the obtained ones in the present paper. However, the physical motivation of existance of the two
Kolmogorov spectra at β

1 in [14]. This limit diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that considered in the present paper. First, at β

1 is diﬀerent.

Plan of the paper is the following. In Section 2 we introduce canonical description of an ideal MHD following to the
original paper of 1972 by V.E.Zakharov and the author [11] and their recent review [12]. By means of the Hamiltonian
description in the next – third section the average equations are derived for A-waves with account of interaction with
slow magneto-acoustic waves. It is shown that from the side of A-waves to slow plasma motion there acts the HF
force. The potential of this force is negative. Therefore, unlike the interaction of Langmuir waves with ion-acoustic
waves [28], plasma is drawn into regions of A-wave localization forming there density humps. In the same section
we analyze stability for the monochromatic A-waves. Section 4 is devoted to the Kolmogorov spectra of weak MHD
turbulence.

Consider the equations of ideal MHD for barotropic ﬂows of plasma when the internal energy of plasma ε depends

only on its density ρ:

Let us formulate the variational principle for this system.
First of all, it should be noticed that as follows from the equations (2.1,2.3) the vector H/ρ is advected by ﬂuid
particles, by another words, each magnetic line moves together with its own particles. This is the well known fact
of frozenness of magnetic ﬁeld into plasma (see, e.g. [25]). The given circumstance allows one to consider both the
magnetic ﬁeld H and the density ρ playing the roles of generalized coordinate.

To formulate the variational principle we shall use the well known expression of the Lagrangian of electromagnetic
ﬁeld and particles (ﬂuid) within [21]. The Lagrangian L should be written in the MHD approximation. In particular,
this means that one needs to neglect by the contribution from the electric ﬁeld E in L in comparison with that from
the magnetic ﬁeld since E
1 (here c the light speed). Secondly, we shall account Eqs. (2.1), (2.3) and
div H = 0 as constraints. As a result, the Lagrangian can be written as follows

The ﬁrst equation in this system gives the change of variables: velocity v is expressed in terms of new variables S
and Φ. It is necessary to note that this change of variables is ambiguous: it is possible to add S the vector S0, and
to Φ the scalar Φ0 satisfying the equation

Two other equations in this system – Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) – represent themselves the Bernoulli equation for the
potential and the equation of motion for a new vector S which contains unknown potential ψ. The potential ψ, in
turn, is deﬁned by ﬁxing gauge of the vector S. For example, for the Coulomb gauge (div S = 0), ψ is determined up
to arbitrary solution ψ0 of the Laplace equation ∆ψ0 = 0:

Now one needs to check that the system of equations (2.4-2.6) does not contradict to the original system of MHD
equations. By plugging (2.4) into the equation of motion (2.2), after simple transformations, it is possible to verify
that Eq. (2.2) can be written in the form:

According to (2.5,2.6) the obtained equation satisﬁes identically. Thus, one can say that the new system
(2.1,2.3,2.5,2.6) is equivalent the MHD system. Really, due to the formula (2.4) any solution of the system

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.1,2.3,2.5,2.6) generates some solution of the original MHD system. Under assumption about uniqueness of the
Cauchy problem for the systems (2.1-2.4) and (2.1,2.3,2.5,2.6) opposite statement is valid also: for any solution of the
system (2.1-2.4) is possible to put in the correspondence some class of solutions of the system (2.1,2.3,2.5,2.6). For
this case it is enough by using a set of quantities v, H, ρ at some moment of time t0 one to construct various sets of
quantities S and Φ, satisfying the formula (2.4) and to take them as initial conditions for the system (2.1,2.3,2.5,2.6).
After that, by means of the Lagrange function, we determine the generalized momentum and construct the Hamil-

tonian of the system, by the standard way:

Respectively, the variables (ρ, Φ) and (H, S) are pairs of canonically conjugated values. Change of variables (2.4) and
canonical description (2.7) were introduced for ideal MHD by Zakharov and the author in 1970 in the paper [11].

The transformation (2.4) represents analog of the Clebsch representation in the ideal hydrodynamics. Respectively,
the ﬁelds H and S in the formula (2.4) play the same role as that of the Clebsch variables (about Clebsch variables see
[18], [26], and recent review [12]). Later, in 1982, the authors of Ref [17]came, in fact, to the same change: the velocity
vector and magnetic ﬁeld were represented through the scalar Clebsch variables that after simple transformations can
be reduced to (2.4).

MHD ﬂows describing by means of (2.4) as well as ﬂows of ideal ﬂuids parameterized by the Clebsch variables are
related to the partial type of ﬂows. For example, for such MHD ﬂows the topological invariant of linkage of magnetic
ﬁeld and vorticity lines, the so-called cross helicity [16] I =

Here a = a(r, t) are Lagrangian markers of ﬂuid particles (this mapping is inverse to r = r(a, t) which deﬁnes particle
trajectory with the marker a ), u0(a) is a new Lagrange invariant.

The Weber transformation (2.8) is the general transform which, in particular, contains at u0 = 0, the change (2.4)
to what the authors of [15] did not pay attention. It is interesting to note that the equations of motion for potentials
Φ and S for the general transform (2.8) have the same form as for (2.5) and (2.6). If Φ and S are equal to zero at
t = 0, then u0(a) is nothing more than the initial velocity. Just the ﬁrst term in (2.8) provides nonzero value of the
topological invariant I. One should note also that this term, as for ideal hydrodynamics, is nonlinear if one proceeds
expansion over small amplitudes. Recently, Ruban [19] (see also [20]) clariﬁed the physical meaning of the vector S.
Curl of the vector S can be expressed through the shift d between electron and ion (as ﬂuid particles) in the point r
at the moment of time t if initially their coordinates coincide:

Here M , e are ion mass and its charge, respectively, ρ0(a) the initial distribution of plasma density.

Introducing the canonical variables allow by the standard way (by means of the perturbation theory against small
amplitudes of waves) both to classify and investigate all nonlinear processes. To this aim one needs in the expression
for the velocity (2.8) as well as in the internal energy to perform expansion in powers of the canonical variables. In
the presence of the external homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld H0, in the linear approximation, one needs to keep the linear
terms relative to Φ and S, neglecting by the ﬁrst (nonlinear) term in (2.8). As the result, in the velocity expansion

As far as the nonlinear interaction of the MHD waves concerns, for strongly magnetized plasma the main nonlinear
process is the process of scattering of the Alfvenic and fast magneto-acoustic waves on the slow magneto-acoustic
waves (that can be veriﬁed directly by comparing the computing matrix elements V lmn for (2.12)). In this process
the former waves (further we shall call them as A-waves) plays the role of the high-frequency (HF) waves relative
to the latter ones (these waves shall be simply called sound or S-waves). This conjecture follows directly from the

For isothermal collisionless plasma (Te ≈

The system of equations (3.10)-(3.12) completely describes interaction of A-waves in magnetized plasma with
arbitrary ratio of ion and electron temperatures. In this case, however, the Hamiltonian H0 + Hint is not conservative
quality due to the Landau damping on ions.

IV. INSTABILITY OF MONOCHROMATIC WAVE

Let us now analyze the obtained equations. We start from study of dynamics of the narrow packet of A-waves.
A qualitative understanding about this process can be obtained from stability analysis of monochromatic A-wave.
In the sake of simplicity we shall restrict by consideration of stability of Alfvenic wave in the hydrodynamic limit.
For collisionless plasma the latter assumes that the phase velocity of bending Ω/κz for A-waves exceeds the thermal
ion velocity vT i. In this case for slow motion one can neglect by the Landau damping on ions and use the equations
(3.8) or (3.12). One should remember that in strongly non-isothermal plasma plasma the sound waves are the eigen
Ti sound waves represent the induced oscillations of the plasma
oscillations but at the same time in plasma with Te ≈
density. However, at Ω/κz ≫

vT i the hydrodynamic description can be applied in both cases.

Then it is convenient to express ρ1s through the normal variables a3(k)

The growth rate width as a function of frequency occurs to be of the order of magnitude of the maximal growth rate

Because the matrix element is proportional to the frequency of slow sound the maximum value of the growth rate

The decay instability (4.6) for arbitrary channel A

A + S, as it is easily seen, relates to the convective type of
instabilities. The excited waves, according to (4.4), have the group velocities strongly diﬀerent from the group velocity
of the pumping wave. Therefore for the wave packet with the characteristic scale L this instability will be essential
only for large enough lengths L when the ampliﬁcation coeﬃcient G exceeds a value of the Coulomb logarithm Λ:

→

∼

G = ΓL/VA ≈
For less lengths L, the decay instability is not important: during propagation of perturbation of through the whole
packet perturbations amplify for a small value. In this case dynamics of the packet will be deﬁned by slow processes.
Among them the most important ones are such processes for which unstable perturbations propagate together with
the wave packet. If it is a decay instability, then it has to be absolute (in the frame moving together with the packet).
In particular, this is one of the reasons of appearance of collapse for fast magneto-acoustic waves and of aﬀect of
sound collapse on the ﬁne structure of collisionless shocks in plasma [23,24]. Collapse of fast magneto-acoustic waves
appears due to three-wave interaction in which only fast magneto-acoustic waves take part.

V. KOLMOGOROV SPECTRA

In the previous section we considered the stability problem for narrow in k-space wave packet. In this case for decay
of monochromatic wave under the resonant conditions (4.5) (namely, for the maximal value of the growth rate (4.6))
sum of the phases of exciting waves φA and φs are strongly connected with the phase of the pumping wave φ0:

φ0 + π/2 = φA + φs.

(It is easily to check that this phase correlation is lost with leaving the resonance (4.5).) Simultaneously, a diﬀerence
in phases for the pair of exciting waves with ﬁxed κ remains arbitrary. Both these factors introduce to the system of
interacted triads, connected with the pumping wave an element of randomness. Thus, each triad is characterized by
one random phase. At the next step - at the second cascade a new random phases are added so that a memory about
the pumping wave will be lost. For multiple repetition of of this process the system of waves must transform in the
turbulent state when the phases of waves can be considered random. Therefore the stochastization time should be a
few inverse growth rate (4.6).

Such scenarion of transition to turbulence seems to be suﬃciently plausible. Now there are being performed a

number of numerical experiments to check this hypothesis (see, for instance, [33], [32]).

Hence it becomes clear that the regime of developed wave turbulence should be characterized by the wide spectrum
of waves. For small enough intensities of waves it is enough one to restrict by consideration of the pair correlation
functions only which obey the kinetic equations for waves. This regime is called weak turbulent.

In the case of the weak MHD turbulence at β

Next, let us include into the kinetic equations (5.1), (5.2) both sources of turbulence and its dissipation. For this
aim in the left hand sides of the equations we introduce new terms Γknk and γkλNkλ, respectively. We suppose here
that the pumping region (Γk, γkλ > 0) and dissipation region (Γk, γkλ < 0) are well separated in k-space by the
intermediate region - the inertial interval, where dynamics of turbulence is deﬁned by nonlinear interaction between
waves only. In the inertial interval we shall neglect by inﬂuence of both pumping and dissipation (that is necessary
to be proved) then distributions nk and Nkλ do not depend on the concrete form of γk and Γk.

We would like to remind that in the theory of developed hydrodynamic turbulence to determine turbulent spectrum
- distribution of energy for velocity ﬂuctuations it is enough to use two hypothesizes of A.N.Kolmogorov [1]. The ﬁrst
hypothesis about self-similarity says that the spectrum of turbulence is deﬁned by the unique quantity P – a constant
ﬂux of energy along scales (from large to small ones where dissipation due to viscosity becomes essential). The second
hypothesis assumes that the interaction of ﬂuctuations with diﬀerent scales has a local character.

If one applies these hypothesizes to the given case then spectra of turbulence in the inertial interval can be found
by means of the dimensional analysis. In the given situation the kinetic equations (5.1), (5.2) have two conservation
laws: conservation of the total energy and the total number of HF waves. To each integral of motion there should
correspond its proper Kolmogorov spectrum. So, for a constant ﬂux of the number of HF waves N λ
k

we have the spectrum:

For a constant ﬂux of energy

one can get the estimate:

From conservation in the inertial range of the total number of HF waves and the energy it is easily to establish that
the ﬂux of HF particles is directed towards small k region, and energy ﬂux is directed to the short wave region.

These – suﬃciently rough – estimations for the spectra (5.3), (5.4) can pretend only to the right dependence on both
wave numbers and ﬂuxes, but they don’t account the diﬀusive character of decays. Notice also that these estimates
are signiﬁcantly based on an assumption of the interaction locality.

The spectra (5.3) and (5.4) don’t account also ﬁne properties of distribution functions – their angle dependences,
namely, they are deﬁned up to arbitrary functions of angles. To ﬁnd these dependences one needs to solve the exact
equations (5.1), (5.2). It turns out that solution of these equations can be found for interaction of Alfvenic and slow
acoustic waves (N2 ≡

0). For this case it is convenient to represent the equations (5.1), (5.2) in the form:

U is bi-homogeneous function of its arguments kz and k⊥ with homogeneity degrees, respectively, equal to +1 for kz

stationary (∂/∂t = 0) equation (5.1). Hence one can get that for this case total energies containing in Alfvenic waves
and in slow magneto-acoustic waves are of the same order of magnitude: csA

It is worth to note that the whole set of the transformations (5.9) forms the group G. This group is direct product
of two groups G(1) and G(2): G = G(1)
G(2). The group G(1) acts in one-dimensional space (kz-space), and G(2)
in the two-dimensional one (k⊥-space). These transformations allow one to factorize the collision terms. First these
transformations (in the 1D case of the frequency space) were found by V.E.Zakharov [5–7]. The generalizations of these
transformation to the both 2D and 3D cases for isotropic models were introduced by A.V.Kats and V.M.Kontorovich
in 1970 [31]. The transformations (5.9) were found by the author in 1972 [8]. They represent a partial type of the
so-called quasi-conformal transformations.

To ﬁnd another non-equilibrium solution of (5.4) it is convenient to introduce the energy density in the k-space

Consider stationary solution of this equation. As before, we shall seek for solution of (5.11) in the form (5.7). In
this case we have three integrals, integration areas of which are deﬁned by the appropriate δ-functions. Therefore
we shall make transformations analogous to (5.9). The transformations of the integration area of the second integral
standing in (5.11) will be the same as (5.9). The transformation of the integration area of the third integral into the
corresponding integration area of the ﬁrst integral in (5.11) has the form:

The obtained solution corresponds to spectra with constant energy ﬂux Pε. Connection between constants A and B,

The found above solutions of the Kolmogorov type are related to the only channel of interaction, namely, the inter-
action between Alfvenic and slow magneto-acoustic waves that demanishes signiﬁcantly the value of these solutions.
Remind, that processes together with fast magneto-acoustic waves have growth rates of the same order of magni-
tudes, and therefore they can not be ignored. Fortunately, the channel (with the fast magneto-acoustic waves) can
be incorporated in the considered above scheme without essential generalizations. As was pointed out in the previous
section, the maximal scattering of A-waves is attained at the maximal value of z-projection of momentum transfered
to slow magneto-acoustic waves while scattering of A-waves. Therefore it is natural to assume that such behavior of
the scattering amplitude of A-waves should lead to strongly anisotropic distribution of waves concentrated in a narrow
k⊥. Under this assumption it is possible to consider the dispersion
cone of angles along mean magnetic ﬁeld: kz ≫

Thus, for almost longitudinal (along the mean magnetic ﬁeld) distribution there is almost no diﬀerence between
Alfvenic and fast magneto-acoustic waves. Moreover, the direct energy exchange is absent between these waves. This
means that for this region of angles Kolmogorov spectra for fast magneto-acoustic waves will have the same form as
those of the obtained spectra (5.10) and (5.13). In this case in the expressions (5.10) and (5.13) Nk and B should be
changed into N λ

The spectra, obtained in this section, will have the physical meaning if the locality property will be fulﬁlled. This
requirement of locality consists in that contributions into interaction of the waves from both the pumping region
and the dissipation region have to be small. The latter leads to the requirement of convergence of integrals in the
equations (5.5) and (5.6).

Convergence of integrals relative to kz provides by the presence of two δ-functions containing kz. As far as con-
vergence against transverse wave vectors concerns, the integrals are logarithmically divergent. The logarithmical
divergence, to our opinion, is not so serious as a possible powerful one. Appearance of divergence is connected with

the same degrees of homogeneity as for the MHD waves at β
1 (such situation, for instance, takes place for
Mandelstamm-Brillouin scattering in isotropic dielectrics) then in such a case the locality property would be valid
(compare with [34]). Violation of bi-homogeneity for interaction of the Alfvenic and slow magneto-acoustic waves

angles:
of logarithm from k⊥ in (5.10) and (5.13). However, this procedure does not lead to determination of the powers,
but, however, provides a convergence of the integrals.

Last remark. The spectra (5.10) as well as (5.13) have the same power dependence on transverse momenta:
⊥ . Their homogeneity degree against transverse momenta is the same as for 2D δ-function of k⊥. This

Which spectra are realized indeed? Rigorous answer to this question is possible to get by stability investigation of
the spectra or numerical experiment (in the latter case one has a hope on the qualitative understanding). Both these
approaches require separate consideration.

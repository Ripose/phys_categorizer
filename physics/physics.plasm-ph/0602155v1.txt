A new version of the invariant imbedding theory for the propagation of coupled waves in inho-
mogeneous media is applied to the mode conversion of high frequency electromagnetic waves into
electrostatic modes in cold, magnetized and stratiﬁed plasmas. The cases where the external mag-
netic ﬁeld is applied perpendicularly to the direction of inhomogeneity and the electron density
proﬁle is linear are considered. Extensive and numerically exact results for the mode conversion
coeﬃcients, the reﬂectances and the wave electric and magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles inside the inhomoge-
neous plasma are obtained. The dependences of mode conversion phenomena on the magnitude of
the external magnetic ﬁeld, the incident angle and the wave frequency are explored in detail.

INTRODUCTION

Mode conversion from one type of wave mode to an-
other type of mode at resonance points in an inhomoge-
neous plasma is a very important phenomenon in various
branches of plasma physics.1,2,3,4 In a previous paper,5
we embarked on a project of developing an exact theory
of mode conversion in inhomogeneous plasmas, which is
based on a new version of the invariant imbedding the-
ory developed by us earlier.6,7 In that paper, we consid-
ered the mode conversion of the simplest kind, that is
the conversion of obliquely-incident p-polarized electro-
magnetic waves into electrostatic plasma oscillations in
cold, unmagnetized and stratiﬁed plasmas.8,9,10,11 Using
the invariant imbedding method,12,13,14,15,16,17 we were
able to calculate the mode conversion coeﬃcient and the
electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution for linear and parabolic
plasma density proﬁles in a numerically exact manner. In
some cases, there were substantial discrepancies between
our results and previous theoretical calculations.

The mode conversion phenomena in cold, unmagne-
tized plasmas are described by a single wave equation.
A large number of wave propagation problems in more
general situations, however, are described by two or more
coupled wave equations. For the study of those problems,
the invariant imbedding method needs to be generalized.
This generalization was already made in Ref. 7 and has
been successfully applied to various problems where sev-
eral coupled waves propagate in inhomogeneous media.
The propagation of electromagnetic waves in magnetized
plasmas also involves several coupled waves. In this pa-
per, we apply the theory developed in Ref. 7 to the mode
conversion of high frequency electromagnetic waves into
electrostatic modes in cold, magnetized and stratiﬁed
plasmas.

Even in the relatively simple cases where the plasma
is cold and stratiﬁed, the mode conversion of electro-
magnetic waves in magnetized plasmas is a highly com-
plex problem. There are three independent directions in
three-dimensional space, which are the directions of inho-

mogeneity, the external magnetic ﬁeld and the incident
wave vector. The wave propagation and mode conversion
phenomena depend on the relative orientations of these
three directions. In the present work, we limit our at-
tention to one special conﬁguration where the external
magnetic ﬁeld is applied perpendicularly to the direc-
tion of inhomogeneity and plane waves propagate in the
plane spanned by the magnetic ﬁeld and the inhomogene-
ity direction. Other conﬁgurations will be considered in
forthcoming papers.

The theory developed in this paper can be applied eas-
ily to multi-species plasmas, which consist of electrons
and diﬀerent kinds of heavy ions. In this paper, we will
consider only the propagation of high frequency waves
and assume heavy ions to be immobile. Rather compli-
cated, but very interesting mode conversion phenomena
associated with low frequency waves and ion density os-
cillations will be subjects of our future publications.

Unlike in the unmagnetized case, the wave propaga-
tion in magnetized plasmas is anisotropic. In a uniform
plasma where the wave vector is not precisely parallel to
the external magnetic ﬁeld, the ordinary (O) wave and
the extraordinary (X) wave are two independent eigen-
modes. When the wave frequency ω is bigger than the
electron cyclotron frequency ωc, there can appear the O
and X mode cutoﬀs and the X mode resonance inside
the plasma. On the other hand, if the wave frequency
is smaller than ωc, the O mode resonance can appear as
well as the O and X mode cutoﬀs.
In inhomogeneous
plasmas, the O and X modes are no longer true eigen-
modes and are coupled to each other. These modes can
also be converted to upper hybrid oscillations at the res-
onances. The presence of both a strong coupling between
diﬀerent modes and the singularity associated with reso-
nance points makes the solution of the mode conversion
problem very diﬃcult. As will be demonstrated later, our
theory allows us to obtain an exact solution of this diﬃ-
cult problem in a remarkably simple and eﬃcient manner.

We will not attempt to give a detailed review of the
literature here. Many of the previous works have
used one approximation scheme or another, most
frequently the WKB method.
In a series of papers,
Mjølhus calculated the mode conversion coeﬃcient for
cold, magnetized plasmas primarily using the WKB
method.26,27,28 This work, which was
reviewed in
Ref. 4 together with theoretical results of many other
researchers, often predicts a complete mode conversion
for certain parameters,
in great contrast with our
results. This discrepancy might be explained in large
part by one crucial diﬀerence between Mjølhus’ and our
calculations. In the present paper, we consider only the
cases where linearly-polarized waves are incident from
a vacuum onto a stratiﬁed plasma, whereas Mjølhus
and other researchers have considered the cases where
O or X waves are incident from a uniform plasma.
Upon entering the plasma, linearly-polarized waves will

case of perpendicular inhomogeneity considered in this
paper and when the waves are incident on a stratiﬁed
plasma normally, mode conversion is caused solely by
the X mode component. In this case, we ﬁnd a perfect
agreement between our result for incident s waves shown
in Fig. 1 and Mjølhus’ result for incident X waves. When
the waves are incident obliquely and for suﬃciently large
values of the parameter w deﬁned in Sec. IV A, mode
conversion is dominated by the incident O mode. This
case is closely related to the theory of radio windows in
the ionosphere and magnetosphere.2,3,4,22,23 We ﬁnd that
the critical parameter values where the mode conversion
coeﬃcient takes the maximum value agrees extremely
well with the analytical formula, Eq. (28), obtained
by previous theories, for suﬃciently large w. This is
another evidence for the consistency between our theory
and previous theories. For quantitative comparisons
with previous results, we need to generalize our method
to the cases where O or X waves are incident from a
uniform plasma. This generalization will be pursued in
future research. Since our theory is capable of producing
exact results for realistic plasma density proﬁles, we
expect it will be useful in the interpretation of various
radio modiﬁcation experiments.

In Sec. II, we present the details of a new version of
the invariant imbedding theory for the propagation of
coupled waves in stratiﬁed media. In Sec. III A, we in-
troduce the coupled wave equations for electromagnetic
waves in cold, magnetized plasmas with perpendicular in-
homogeneity. In Sec. III B, we describe two linear plasma
density proﬁles used for the calculations in this paper.
The results of our calculations are presented in Sec. IV.
In Sec. IV A, we study the magnetic ﬁeld dependence
of mode conversion coeﬃcients.
In Sec. IV B, we con-
sider the dependence of mode conversion coeﬃcients on
the incident angle in detail. We also consider the spatial
dependence of electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensities. In
Sec. IV C, we discuss the frequency dependence of mode

conversion coeﬃcients. We conclude the paper in Sec. V.
In Appendix A, we give a detailed derivation of Eq. (19).

INVARIANT IMBEDDING THEORY OF

THE PROPAGATION OF COUPLED WAVES IN
STRATIFIED MEDIA

In Ref. 7, we have developed a new version of the
invariant imbedding theory for the propagation of cou-
pled waves in arbitrarily-inhomogeneous stratiﬁed media.
Since this theory will play a central role in our develop-
ment of the theory of mode conversion, we give a detailed
presentation of it here.

We consider N coupled waves propagating in a strat-
iﬁed medium, where all physical parameters depend on
only one spatial coordinate. We choose this coordinate
as the z axis and assume the inhomogeneous medium of
thickness L lies in 0
L. We also assume that all
waves propagate in the xz plane. The x component of
the wave vector, q, is then a constant. In a large class
of interesting problems, the wave equation of N coupled
waves in stratiﬁed media has the form

interest is in the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcient
matrices r = r(L) and t = t(L). The wave function in
the incident and transmissive regions are expressed in
terms of r and t:

two matrices, eiP (z−L) r and e−iP z t, in the given order.
From Eq. (4), we obtain Ψ(L) = I + r and Ψ(0) = t.

We assume that the plasma density varies only in

the present geometry is written as

sume that all ﬁeld components depend on x and t through
a factor ei[(k sin θ)x−ωt], where k = ω/c and θ is the inci-
dent angle, and have no y dependence. In this situation,
we can eliminate Ex, Ez, Bx and Bz from Eq. (18) and
obtain two coupled wave equations satisﬁed by the z-
dependent ﬁeld amplitudes Ey = Ey(z) and By = By(z),

We use Eqs. (12), (13) and (19) in calculating the re-
ﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients.
In our notation,
r11 (r21) is the reﬂection coeﬃcient when the incident
wave is Ey (that is, s-polarized) and the reﬂected wave
is Ey (By). Similarly, r22 (r12) is the reﬂection coeﬃ-
cient when the incident wave is By (that is, p-polarized)
and the reﬂected wave is By (Ey). Similar deﬁnitions
are applied to the transmission coeﬃcients. The re-

If z > L or z < 0, the dielectric tensor is equal to a unit
matrix. For speciﬁc calculations, we will assume f0 = 1
MHz and fc = 1.5 MHz. Then the local plasma frequency
varies from 1 MHz at z = L to 5 MHz at z = 0.

IV. RESULTS

A. Magnetic ﬁeld dependence

In this subsection, we study the dependence of mode
conversion coeﬃcients on the magnitude of the external
magnetic ﬁeld B0, or equivalently on the cyclotron fre-
quency ωc. We ﬁrst consider the simplest case where
linearly-polarized plane waves are incident normally (i.e.
θ = 0) on a layer of inhomogeneous plasma with the lin-
ear density proﬁle given by Eq. (20). In this case, it is
well-known that there is a resonance associated with X
waves if the wave frequency is equal to the upper hybrid
c )1/2, whereas there is no reso-
frequency ωuh = (ω2
nance associated with O waves. For L > Λ, the resonance
condition ω = ωuh can be satisﬁed if Y < 1 (i.e. ω > ωc).
The coordinate of the resonance point zR is given by

Since we are considering the cases where waves are inci-
dent from a vacuum region, we assume that the incident
wave is either s- or p-polarized. In the case of normal
incidence, p waves are the same as O waves and s waves
are similar to X waves. Therefore we expect that there is
no mode conversion when p waves are incident normally,
whereas some portion of normally-incident s waves will
convert to upper hybrid oscillations.

Actual calculations using our invariant imbedding the-
ory show that the p wave absorption A2 vanishes indeed
when the damping constant ˜ν is very small. In Fig. 1,
we plot the s wave mode conversion coeﬃcient A1 as a
ζ1/3√Y
function of the dimensionless parameter w
≡
ωΛ/c and for θ = 0,
(
∝
˜ν = 10−8 and L/Λ = 20. We notice that A1 approaches
a universal curve as ζ increases to large values. We ﬁnd
this universal curve agrees remarkably well with Fig. 4
presented in Ref. 4.

√B0) for several values of ζ

≡

Next we consider the cases where linearly-polarized
waves are incident obliquely at an angle θ. In those cases,
both s and p waves can generate X mode components in-
side the inhomogeneous plasma and be converted to up-
per hybrid oscillations at z = zR. In Fig. 2, we show the
s (p) wave mode conversion coeﬃcient A1 (A2) as a func-
ζ1/3 sin θ
tion of w for several values of the parameter v
and for ζ = 500, ˜ν = 10−8 and L/Λ = 20. As the incident
angle increases, A2 grows from zero to ﬁnite values.

≡

In Fig. 3, we plot the reﬂectances R11, R22 and R12 for
ζ = 500, ˜ν = 10−8 and L/Λ = 20. The parameter v is
equal to 1 in Fig. 3(a) and 2 in Fig. 3(b). It can be proved
that R21 is always identical to R12. We observe that in
the parameter region where there is no mode conversion,
the reﬂectances are rapidly oscillating functions of w.

B.

Incident angle dependence and the

electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution

In this subsection, we consider the dependence of mode
conversion coeﬃcients on the incident angle θ in detail.
We also consider the spatial dependence of electric and
magnetic ﬁeld intensities associated with the electromag-
netic wave. In Fig. 4, we show the s (p) wave mode con-
version coeﬃcient A1 (A2) as a function of the parameter
v, which is proportional to sin θ, for several values of w
and for ζ = 500, ˜ν = 10−8 and L/Λ = 20. In the absence
of the external magnetic ﬁeld, the s wave mode conver-
sion coeﬃcient A1 vanishes, whereas the p wave mode
conversion coeﬃcient A2 agrees with the result for un-
magnetized cases reported in Ref. 7. When B0 > 0, A1
becomes nonzero. For w values well over 1, mode con-
version occurs in a narrow range of v or θ. This range
is called the radio window and becomes narrower as w
or ζ increases. In Fig. 5, we plot the reﬂectances R11,
R22 and R12 for ζ = 500, ˜ν = 10−8 and L/Λ = 20. The
parameter w is equal to 0.5 in Fig. 5(a), 1 in Fig. 5(b)
and 2 in Fig. 5(c).

The occurrence of radio windows is closely related to
the coupling between the O mode and the X mode near
the position where ω = ωp, which has the coordinate
z = L
z0) in our proﬁle. It is well-known that
this coupling is most eﬃcient when the incident angle
satisﬁes

for Y > 1, where α is the angle between the external

equal to 90◦ in our case.2,3,4,22,28,29 Then it is easy to
see that there is no incident angle satisfying Eq. (27) and
that Eq. (26) can be rewritten as

v =

w
1 + w2/ζ2/3

,

where we have kept only the plus sign.

p

In Fig. 6(a), we plot v1,max and v2,max, which are the v
values where A1 and A2 take the maximum values A1,max
and A2,max respectively in Fig. 4, versus w for ζ = 500,
˜ν = 10−8 and L/Λ = 20 and compare them with Eq. (28).
We ﬁnd that when w is greater than about 1, the agree-
ment between our result and Eq. (28) is excellent. When
w < 1, however, our result diﬀers greatly from Eq. (28).
In Fig. 6(b), the maximum mode conversion coeﬃcients
A1,max and A2,max are plotted versus w.

In the rest of this subsection, we consider the spatial
dependence of electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensities in-
side the inhomogeneous plasma. Using Eqs. (14) and

(19), we have calculated the electric and magnetic ﬁeld
components Ey1(z) and By1(z) for incident s waves and
Ey2(z) and By2(z) for incident p waves. In Fig. 7, we
plot the absolute values of Ey1(z), By1(z), Ey2(z) and
By2(z) for ζ = 50, ˜ν = 10−3 and L/Λ = 20. v is chosen
1 + w2/ζ2/3
to be equal to the critical value vc ≡
and the value of w is 1 in Figs. 7(a-d), 2 in Figs. 7(e-h)
and 3 in Figs. 7(i-l). On these ﬁgures, we also indicate
the positions of the resonant point zR given by Eq. (25)
and the point zc where incident waves start to become
evanescent when Eq. (28) is satisﬁed. zc turns out to be
given by

w/

p

zc −

z0 = Λ

2Y
1 + Y

,

(29)

where Y = w2/ζ2/3. For zR < z < zc, electromagnetic
waves are expected to be evanescent. The highly oscil-
lating behavior for z < zR in Figs. 7(i-l) comes from a
branch of the X mode commonly known as the Z mode.
In Fig. 8, we compare the ﬁeld distributions at the
critical value of v given by Eq. (28) with those for v
slightly diﬀerent from the critical value. In Figs. 8(e-h),
ζ = 50, ˜ν = 10−3, L/Λ = 20, w = 3 and v = vc ≈
2.326.
0.1 in Figs. 8(a-d) and vc + 0.1 in
v is equal to vc −
Figs. 8(i-l) and all other parameters are the same as in
Figs. 8(e-h). We ﬁnd that the evanescent behavior is
absent in oﬀ-critical cases.

In Fig. 9, we show the absolute values of the z compo-

7

nents of the electric ﬁeld, Ez1 for incident s waves and
Ez2 for incident p waves, calculated using Eq. (A2). The
parameters used are ζ = 50, ˜ν = 10−3, L/Λ = 20, w = 3
0.3 for Figs. 9(a-b),
and v = vc for Figs. 9(c-d), v = vc −
v = vc + 0.3 for Figs. 9(e-f).
In oﬀ-critical cases, the
evanescent behavior is absent and the divergence at the
resonance point becomes weaker.

C. Frequency dependence

For the study of the frequency dependence of mode
conversion phenomena, we use the plasma density proﬁle
given by Eq. (22). We assume f0 = 1 MHz, so the local
plasma frequency varies from 1 MHz at z = L to 5 MHz
at z = 0. The cyclotron frequency fc is 1.5 MHz and the
collision frequency fν is equal to 10−8 MHz. We show
the mode conversion coeﬃcients A1 and A2 for several
incident angles and for L = 250 m in Fig. 10 and for
L = 1500 m in Fig. 11. In all cases, mode conversion is
found to occur only in the frequency range determined
by the upper hybrid frequency. In other words, A1 and
A2 are nonzero only for √12 + 1.52
1.8 MHz < f <
√52 + 1.52
5.22 MHz.

In the case of uniform magnetized plasmas, the O (X)
wave shows a resonance when the wave frequency ω is
equal to the resonance frequency ωO (ωX ). The frequen-
cies ωO and ωX are given by

where φ is the angle between the external magnetic ﬁeld

curs only when ω is equal to ωuh regardless of the incident
angle suggests that in our stratiﬁed plasma, only the X
wave component propagating in the direction of inhomo-
geneity with φ = 90◦ can cause mode conversion.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have presented a new version of the
invariant imbedding theory for the propagation of cou-
pled waves in inhomogeneous media and applied it to
the mode conversion of high frequency electromagnetic
waves into electrostatic modes in cold, magnetized and
stratiﬁed plasmas. We have considered the cases where

the external magnetic ﬁeld is applied perpendicularly to
the direction of inhomogeneity and the electron density
proﬁle is linear. We have obtained extensive and numer-
ically exact results for the mode conversion coeﬃcients,
the reﬂectances and the wave electric and magnetic ﬁeld
proﬁles inside the inhomogeneous plasma. We have ex-
plored the dependences of mode conversion phenomena
on the size of the external magnetic ﬁeld, the incident
angle and the wave frequency in detail. Our theoretical
method and results are expected to be quite useful in
investigating a broad range of observations and experi-
ments on the interaction between electromagnetic waves
and plasmas both in space and laboratories. In forthcom-
ing papers, we will apply our theory to the cases where
the external magnetic ﬁeld is applied in diﬀerent direc-
tions and to the propagation and mode conversion of low

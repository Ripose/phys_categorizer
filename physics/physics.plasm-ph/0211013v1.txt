Within the approximation of dominant charging collisions
the explicit microscopic calculations of the Fokker-Planck ki-
netic coeﬃcients for highly-charged grains moving in plasma
are performed. It is shown that due to ion absorption by grain
the friction coeﬃcient can be negative and the appropriate
threshold value of the grain charge is found. The stationary
solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation with the velocity de-
pendent kinetic coeﬃcient are obtained and the considerable
deviation of such solutions from the Maxwellian distribution
is established.

In the systems close to equilibrium Brownian parti-
cles keep stationary random motion under the action of
stochastic forces which are compensated by the particle
friction and thus, the work produced by the Langevin
sources is equal to the energy dissipated in course of
the Brownian particle motion. This energy balance is
described by the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem in the
form of the Einstein law. Obviously, the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem and the Einstein relation can be vi-
olated in the case of non-equilibrium systems (even in
the stationary case), in particular in the open systems.
Starting from the classical Lord Rayleigh work [1] many
studies of the non-equilibrium motion of Brownian par-
ticles with additional (inner, or external) energy supply
have been performed. In particular, such studies are of
great importance for physico-chemical [2, 3] and biolog-
ical [4] systems in which non-equilibrium Brownian par-
ticle motion is referred as the motion of active Brownian
particles. Recently the dynamical and energetic aspects
of motion for the active Brownian particles have been de-
scribed on the basis of the Langevin equation and the ap-
propriate Fokker-Planck equation [5, 6]. The possibility
of negative friction (negative values of friction coeﬃcient)
of the Brownian particles was regarded, as a result of en-
ergy pumping. For some phenomenological dependences
of the friction coeﬃcient as a function of the grain’s ve-
locity the one-particle stationary non-Maxwellian distri-
bution function was found.

The traditional formulations of the non-equilibrium
Brownian motion are based on some phenomenological
expressions for the friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients. In
particular, it means that deviations from the Einstein
relation, as well as the velocity dependence of these co-
eﬃcients are postulated and high level of uncertainty for
the application of such models to the real systems takes
place. Here we will consider another situation, when the
kinetic coeﬃcients can be calculated exactly on the ba-

≡

e2ZgZi/aTi ≫

sis of the microscopically derived Fokker-Planck equation
for dusty plasmas [7,8]. It will be shown that in the case
of strong interaction parameter Γ
1
(here Zg, Zi are the charge numbers for the grains and
ions respectively, a is the grain radius, Ti
is the ion
temperature) the negative friction coeﬃcient appears for
some velocity domain.
If the charging collisions are
dominant, this domain is determined by the inequal-
ities: v2 < 10v2

The physical reason for manifestation of negative friction
is clear: the cross-section for ion absorption by grain in-
creases with the relative velocity between the ion and
grain decrease due to the charge-dependent part of the
cross-section. Therefore, for a moving highly-charged
grain (Γ
1) the momentum transfer from ions to the
grain in the direction of grain velocity is higher than in
the opposite direction.

Naturally, the Coulomb scattering and particle friction
related to the ion-grain and neutral-grain elastic colli-
sions will increase the threshold for negative friction and
even can suppress it for some plasma parameters. How-
ever, the latter are rather sophisticated processes, and
their theoretical description within various approxima-
tions can shadow the physics of the phenomenon. Some
estimate of the inﬂuence of such processes will be also
done below, but the detailed description of their inﬂu-
ence should be a matter of further consideration. On
the other hand, the problem of microscopic investigation
of negative friction in dusty plasmas is so fundamental,
that it deserves a description of its simplest manifestation
(which occurs in the case of dominant charging collisions)
to be considered in this Letter.

We start from the Fokker-Planck equation for the
spherical grains in dusty plasma with typical narrow
charge distribution around a negative value q = eeZg,
that permits to put all grain charges to be equal. We
also ignore the increase of the grain mass [9, 10] assum-
ing that neutral atoms generated in the course of the
surface electron-ion recombination escape from the grain
λD,
surface into a plasma. Than, for the conditions li ≫
a, where li is the ion mean free path length and λD is
the plasma screening (Debye) length, the friction and dif-
fusion coeﬃcients in the Fokker-Planck kinetic equation
β(q, v) and D(q, v) [8] are given by:

σgα(q, v) = πa2

Here σgα(q, v) is the cross-section for grain charging
within the orbital motion limited (OML) theory. In this
approximation all electrons and ions approaching to the
grain on the distance less than a are assumed to be ab-
sorbed. Subscript α = e, i labels plasma particle species.
The rest of notation is traditional. To include the pro-
cesses of the electron, ion and atom scattering we have
to summarize the appropriate coeﬃcients on the diﬀerent
type of the processes. In the case of dominant charging
collisions integration in Eq. (1) can be performed explic-
itly. The ion part of β (which exceeds the electron one
at least in (miTe/meTi)1/2 times) is the following

As follows from the physical reason and directly from
Eq. (3), the coeﬃcient D(q, v) is always positive. At the
same time for some values of η and Γ the friction coeﬃ-
cient βi(q, v) can be negative. To ﬁnd the root η(Γ) of
the equation βi(η, Γ) = 0 let us consider for two limiting
cases η

Therefore the function βi(η, Γ) is negative at η < η(Γ), if
Γ > 1. Eq. (4) shows that for Γ < 1, when βi is positive
for all η, the derivative (dβi(η, Γ)/dη)
|η=0 changes its sign
at Γ = 1/3. Near η = 0 the friction βi decreases as
function η, if Γ < 1/3 and increases, if Γ > 1/3.

and Dν is the cylindrical parabolic function. Eq. (10) is
relevant, if the integral over η converges, what is valid
for positive γ(Γ > 0, 472). At the same time, as was
mentioned above, for the applicability of the expansions
(4), (8) the inequality Γ < 1 + δ with δ
1 is required.
It is clear from Eqs. (6), (8), that the asymptotic be-
haviour of the distribution function is non-exponential
η−(mg/mi), but for the values of Γ under
fg(η)
consideration it is not essential for calculations of the av-
erages, due to the rapid convergence of the integrals over
η. In particular, the average kinetic energy K of grains
is

(12)

that gives K = 2, 86(mg/mi)1/2Ti for Γ = 1. Thus, the
ion absorption by grains can lead to grain heating and
grain average kinetic energy (or their eﬀective temper-
ature) can be much higher, than the electron and ion
temperatures. This eﬀect can be applied to the explana-
tion of the experimental data [11, 12], as it was already
suggested in [7,8] on the basis of the velocity independent
approximation for β and D.

Let us consider now the case Γ

1. In this case the

(Ti/mi)β(η, Γ)/D(η, Γ) can be represented
ratio Q =

Q = (mg/mi)(Γ

The above conclusions are in a good agreement with
the results of numerical calculations of fg(η, Γ) on the
basis of Eq. (9) (Fig. 4).

In conclusion, ion absorption by grains can generate
negative friction and provide the substantial increase of
the average grain kinetic energy in comparison with the
temperatures of the other plasma components. Micro-
scopical justiﬁcation of negative friction on kinetic level
is presented and deviation of the grain distribution func-
tion from the Maxwellian distribution is found. For dusty
plasma, as for an open system, the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem in the form of Einstein relation is not applicable.

If we take into account the processes of atom-grain

and D(η, Γ) should include additional terms. To esti-
mate, for example, contribution of atom-grain and ion-

The negative friction exists for small η, if the Coulomb

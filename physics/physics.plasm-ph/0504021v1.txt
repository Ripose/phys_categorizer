A simple analytical model of the barrier discharge in a long gap between opposing plane electrodes
is developed. It is shown that the plasma density becomes uniform over large part of the gap in the
course of the discharge development, so that one can speak of a formation of a dynamic positive
column. The column completely controls the dynamics of the barrier discharge and determines such
characteristics as the discharge current, discharge duration, light output, etc. Using the proposed
model, all discharge parameters can be easily evaluated.

INTRODUCTION

Dielectric barrier discharges are typically generated in
gas gaps between two electrodes covered with dielectric
layers. Sinusoidal or square-wave voltage with frequen-
cies ranging from few kHz to hundreds of kHz are used to
generate the discharges. The product of the gas pressure
and the distance between the dielectric surfaces pD can
vary quite signiﬁcantly. In the present paper we consider
barrier micro-discharges such as used in Plasma Display
Panels [1] and excimer lamps [2] where pD

The dynamics of a barrier discharge during one pulse of
the applied square-wave voltage was considered in detail
analytically in our previous work [3], where it was shown
that at high overvoltage the discharge develops into an
ionization wave, whose velocity is determined primarily
by the charge production rate in the cathode fall region.
This wave moves from the anode toward the cathode,
resulting in contraction of the cathode fall region and in-
crease of the electric ﬁeld within this region. Upon reach-
ing the cathode, the ionization wave can either quickly
disappear (when the capacitance of the dielectric layer is
small) or transform into a quasi-stationary DC cathode
fall (when the capacitance is large). The main assump-
tion of that work was that the resistance of the plasma
trail, created by the ionization wave, can be neglected.

In the present paper we consider the opposite case,
when the barrier discharge dynamics is strongly inﬂu-
enced by the plasma trail which electrically connects the
anode with the cathode fall region. As will be shown be-
low, in the case of a long gap the plasma trail becomes
uniform over the large part of the gap, virtually forming
a dynamic positive column. The uniformity of the col-
umn enables us to consider it simply as a variable resistor
through which the cathode fall (CF) charges the dielec-
tric layer capacitor (see Fig. 1). When the capacitance is
large, one can introduce further simpliﬁcations into the
model. In this case the CF is, in essence, quasi-stationary
and its V-I characteristics can be approximated by those

of the DC cathode fall [4].

In our work we neglect the volume and near-wall re-
combination of charged particles, which if included into
consideration would only increase the resistance of the
positive column and enhance its role in the barrier dis-
charge dynamics.

Although dynamic characteristics of barrier discharges
have been already extensively studied via computer sim-
ulations (see Ref. [5] and references therein), it remained
unclear, for example, what processes control the duration
and amplitude of the current pulse. The proposed model
answers this question and can be used to estimate var-
ious parameters of long-gap barrier discharges between
opposing plane electrodes. This type of discharges (as
well as [6, 7, 8]) may prove to be a viable alternative to
near-surface discharges [9, 10, 11, 12] favored nowadays
in Plasma Display Panel industry.

II. QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATION AND
BASIC EQUATIONS

We will consider discharges in a gas gap between op-
posing plane electrodes covered by dielectric layers of
thickness d and dielectric constant ǫ. We assume that
the gap length Lg is much larger than the length of the
normal cathode fall,

Lg

Lnorm.

≫

(1)

It is also assumed that the dielectric layer capacitance
is large, i.e. the eﬀective thickness of dielectric layers is

small,

2d/ǫ . Lnorm.

(2)

For example, in the case of 10%-Xe/90%-Ne mixture at
pressure 500 Torr and secondary emission coeﬃcients
γN e = 0.5 and γXe = 0.005, the normal cathode fall
6.5µm, the gap length under considera-
length Lnorm
tion is from several hundred microns to one millimeter,
and the eﬀective thickness of dielectric layers is less than
or about several microns.

∼

Although discharges in gaps with such a long distance
between the anode and cathode can be initiated in sev-
eral diﬀerent ways (by, for example, using a set of aux-
iliary electrodes), we assume that the Townsend break-
down takes place .

Under these assumptions (long gap, large capacitance,
Townsend mechanism of the breakdown), the general pic-
ture of the discharge dynamics can be described as fol-
lows:

1. Upon application of a suﬃciently high voltage across
the gap (Uappl > Ubr, where Ubr is the breakdown volt-
age), the Townsend criterion is satisﬁed and the positive
charge starts to build up in the gap. While the amount of
total charge is small (and thus the electric ﬁeld is undis-
turbed), it grows exponentially with time.

2. At some moment it reaches a critical value (
∼
ǫ0Vappl/Lg) and causes considerable distortion of the
electric ﬁeld. The ﬁeld vanishes at the anode and from
this moment on there coexist two diﬀerent regions in the
gap: the region ﬁlled with plasma (plasma trail) where
the electric ﬁeld is relatively small, and the region of the
gap adjacent to the cathode where the electric ﬁeld is
strong and the electron density is negligible. With time,
the plasma trail expands toward the cathode while the
CF region contracts. At this stage, the process of the
plasma trail uniformization begins.

3. When the length of the CF region becomes com-
parable to Lnorm, it transforms into a quasi-stationary
DC cathode fall and the discharge current sharply in-
creases and, after reaching its maximum, decreases. The
plasma density in the already uniformized plasma trail
(positive column) grows while the electric ﬁeld there falls
(see Fig. 2). These processes are accompanied by the in-
tensive deposition of power from the external source into
the discharge. At the end of this stage, the main portion
of the external voltage drops across the dielectric layer
capacitor, which leads to quenching of the discharge.

4. In the afterglow, the number of ions and electrons
in the gap gradually decreases through the dissociative
recombination of electrons and molecular ions. Charged
particles are also pulled out of the plasma toward the
dielectric surfaces by the residual (and ambipolar) elec-
tric ﬁelds. Note that although the discharge current is
small during the discharge decay, the voltage transferred
to the capacitor is about the normal CF voltage Vnorm
(when 2d/ǫ

Lnorm).

The key feature of long-gap barrier discharges is that
the plasma trail is uniform during the stage three, when

strong: I(t1) = 0.5Imax, I(t2) = Imax, and I(t3) = 0.5Imax,
where Imax is the maximum discharge current.

the discharge current is strong. The intrinsic mechanism
responsible for the uniformization can be qualitatively
explained as follows: Due to the plasma quasi-neutrality,
which quickly establishes in the Maxwellian time (see
Sec. IV), the particle current is constant throughout the
plasma trail. Therefore the electric ﬁeld is higher in re-
gions where plasma density is lower. The higher electric
ﬁeld results in higher ionization rate, which in turn leads
to faster growth of the plasma in these regions and, even-
tually, to a leveling oﬀ of the plasma density.

To ﬁnd the plasma density in the positive column, one

can use the continuity equation for electrons

∂n
∂t −

∂nµeE
∂x

= r(E) n,

(3)

where n is the electron (plasma) density, µe is the elec-
tron mobility, E is the electric ﬁeld in the column, and
r(E) is the ionization rate. For simplicity, we omitted
the diﬀusion part of the electron ﬂux in Eq. (3). Neglect-
ing the motion of ions (ion mobility is several hundred
times lower than the electron mobility) and using the
constancy of the particle current, one can immediately
arrive at the following relationship between the plasma
density and the electric ﬁeld in the positive column,

enµeE = I(t)/S,

(4)

where e is the elementary charge, I(t) is the discharge
current, and S is the cross-sectional area of the discharge.
Since the electron mobility is almost constant at small
electric ﬁelds, from Eq. (4) it follows that

δnEpc + npcδE = 0,

(5)

where δn and δE are perturbations and npc and Epc are
the average values of the plasma density and electric ﬁeld
in the plasma column. Using Eqs. (3)-(5), one can readily
obtain

Note, that at not very high current densities, the DC
CF voltage changes insigniﬁcantly (see Fig. 3). The case
when the VCF is taken constant and equal to Vnorm is
considered in the next section.

While the obvious equation (6) describes growth of the
plasma density in the positive column, Eq. 7 shows fast
decay of the density perturbations (since under positive
column conditions Epcr′(Epc) > r(Epc)). Let us em-
phasize that, as is seen from our derivation, the mech-
anism of the positive column uniformization has an en-
tirely dynamic nature and manifests itself regardless of
the diﬀusion processes. It is interesting to note that the
uniformization takes place even in a more general case
[13] when the discharge can not be treated as quasi-one-
dimensional.

In this paper we give a simple analytic description of
only the third stage of the discharge development, when
discharge current is strong. During this stage, the posi-
tive column occupies almost the entire gap, and as seen
from Eq. (6) its resistance R
Lg/(enpcµeS) is governed

When VCF = Vnorm = const, it is convenient to use
R and Epc as independent variables. Replacing the IR

Condition (16) indicates that at the beginning, there is no
plasma in the discharge gap, and condition (17) directly
follows from condition (14) and the Kirchoﬀ’s law (11).
We would like to point out that, based on what was
said in the previous section, Eqs. (8) and (15) do not
describe the initial stages of the discharge development,
when the positive column is being formed, neither do they
describe the ﬁnal stage, when the discharge quenches and
the cathode fall dies.

Now let us turn our attention to the analysis of the
system of Eqs. (8) and (15). Dividing left and right parts
of equation (8) by the corresponding parts of equation
(15) and multiplying both parts by C we obtain

which should be solved with the initial condition (17).
From this equation, one can see that the time evolution of
the electric ﬁeld in the neutral column depends only on its
initial value and the ionization rate, and does not depend
explicitly on the electron mobility. Because the right
part of equation (21) is always negative, the electric ﬁeld
monotonically decreases with time from E0 to zero. The
discharge current in our model is uniquely determined by
the electric ﬁeld,

ELg

≡

= LgCE ¯r(E, E0).

(22)

It goes from zero (at E = E0), trough the maximum (at
E = E∗), to zero again (at E = 0), see Fig. 4. The elec-
tric ﬁeld E∗ at the current maximum can be determined
from the extremum condition dI(E)/dE = 0, which, with
the use of Eq. (22), can be written as

r(E∗) = ¯r(E∗, E0).

(23)

The typical shape of the function r(E)/E (which is pro-
portional to the the ionization coeﬃcient α(E)) as well as
the graphical solution of equation (23) is given in Fig. 5.
From this ﬁgure, one can see, in particular, that always
E0/2 < E∗ < E0. If r(E)/E grows faster than the linear
function, then E0/√3 < E∗ < E0.

Using Eqs. (22) and (23), the expression for maximum

current can be written as

Imax = CLgE∗ r(E∗).

(24)

FIG. 5: Graphical solution of equation (23). Area of the
dashed rectangle on the left is equal to r(E∗), while the area
of the dashed region under the r(E)/E curve on the right
is equal to ¯r(E∗, E0). These areas are equal when E∗ is the
electric ﬁeld at the current maximum.

This equation shows that in the present model the max-
imum current is proportional to the dielectric layer ca-
pacitance. Dependence on the gap length Lg is more
complicated, since E∗ also depends on Lg (through E0).
The time duration τcur of the current pulse can be de-

ﬁned as the ratio of transferred charge Qtr = C (Vappl
VCF ) = CLgE0 to the maximum current,

For a steeper dependence of the ionization coeﬃcient on

even greater.

This expression gives reasonable estimates far beyond the

ﬁeld is small in the positive column, in the case of noble

V-I characteristics of the DC cathode fall (10) and make
certain that

and from ﬂuid simulations under diﬀerent discharge con-
ditions. A striking feature of all these ﬁgures is that the
amplitude of the renormalized current I/C changes by
only a factor of 2
3 when the capacitance C changes by
two orders of magnitude (compare curves 2,3 and 5). A
prediction of our model that I/C does not depend on C
(see Eq. (24)) is qualitatively correct even when the cri-
terion (2) of the model applicability is not satisﬁed. For
curve 5, the eﬀective dielectric thickness 2d/ǫ = 10µm is
greater than the normal CF length Lnorm
6.5µm, so
that the CF is not quasi-stationary but dynamic!

≈

Understandably, the VCF = Vnorm approximation over-
estimates the amplitude of the discharge current, since
Vnorm is the minimal voltage on the cathode fall; this
overestimation is more pronounced for shorter gaps.

Another interesting feature of the long-gap discharge
dynamics is that the duration of the current pulse in-
creases with increase of the gap length (compare Fig. 8
with Figs. 6 and 7), which is not at all obvious since the
applied voltage is greater in the case of the longer gap.
Qualitatively this discharge property is attributed to the
increase in inertia of the positive column with its length.
Note also that in the case of the large capacitance (ab-
normal quasi-stationary CF, see curve 3), the discharge
current grows quickly and falls slowly. In the opposite
case of the small capacitance (dynamic CF, see curve 5),
the current grows somewhat slower than it falls.

Similar to DC discharges, the positive column in bar-
rier discharges is more eﬃcient source of light (radiation)
than the cathode fall. In the positive column, where the
electric ﬁeld is weak, almost all the deposited energy goes
into excitation of atoms, while in the cathode fall signif-
icant portion of the energy is spent on the ion heating,
and, because the electric ﬁeld is strong, a considerable
part of the rest goes into ionization of atoms rather than
excitation. It is obvious that the case when the cathode
fall is very abnormal (i.e. when the C is very large) is
not optimal for the light production. The question of the
optimal capacitance of dielectric layers – i.e. the optimal
relationship between 2d/ǫ and Lnorm (which determines
to what degree the CF is dynamic) – should be dealt with
in the context of concrete discharge parameters.

At the end of this section,

let us make several re-
marks regarding the quasi-neutrality of the plasma in

6

the positive column and possible generalizations of our
model. The quasi-neutrality results from the fact that
Maxwellian relaxation time is much less than the time of
plasma growth in the column (which is of the order of
τcur). Using Eq. (28), one can estimate

(36)

Our model allows us to include plasma losses due to am-
bipolar diﬀusion to the walls surrounding the discharge
volume and due to recombination by subtracting from
−1
dif npc (τdif is the char-
the r.h.s. of Eq. (6) the terms τ
acteristic ambipolar diﬀusion time) and krn2
pc (kr is the
recombination coeﬃcient). Note, however, that the side
walls can strongly inﬂuence the breakdown stage of the
discharge [14] and can even lead to the formation of near-
dielectric-surface discharge rather than the volume one.

V. CONCLUSION

The dynamics of a barrier discharge between oppos-
ing electrodes separated by a long gap which is ﬁlled
with a mixture of noble gases has been considered.
It
has been shown that during the discharge development,
there forms a region between the anode and the cathode
fall similar to a DC positive column, where the plasma
density and electric ﬁeld are uniform but, in contrast to a
DC case, change in time. The mechanism of the positive
column uniformization has an entirely dynamic nature.
It is caused by the ionization processes and has nothing
to do with the diﬀusion.

A simple discharge model allowed us to obtain useful
estimates for the plasma density, number of excitations
and ionizations, and power consumption; it also helped
to capture non-trivial trends in the dependence of the
discharge current on discharge parameters.

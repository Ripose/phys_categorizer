(Dated: October, 2005)
The ion acceleration driven by a laser pulse at intensity I = 1020 − 1022 W/cm2 × (µm/λ)2 from
a double layer target is investigated with multi-parametric Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. For
targets with a wide range of thickness l and density ne, at given intensity the highest ion energy
gain occurs at certain critical depth of the target σ = nel, which is proportional to the square root
of intensity. In the case of thin targets and optimal laser pulse duration, the ion maximum energy
scales as the square root of the laser pulse power. When the radiation pressure of the laser ﬁeld
becomes dominant, the ion maximum energy becomes proportional to the laser pulse energy.

PACS numbers: 52.38.Kd, 52.65.Rr, 29.25.-t, 41.75.Lx

The laser-driven ion acceleration can be of beneﬁt
for many applications, e. g., hadron therapy in oncol-
ogy [1], fast ignition of thermonuclear fusion by protons
[2], production of sources for positron emitting tomogra-
phy (PET) [3], conversion of radioactive waste [4], etc.
The radiation pressure dominant (RPD) regime of the
laser ion acceleration [5] can be a basis for a laser-driven
heavy ion collider and proton dump facility for neutrino
oscillation studies [6]. All these applications can be-
come possible owing to invention of high-intense lasers
[7], that now are capable to produce pulses with inten-
sity 1020 − 1022 W/cm2.

Irradiation of solid targets by lasers with power from
terawatt (TW) to petawatt (PW) and intensity up to
1021 W/cm2 resulted in generation of proton beams with
maximum energy Emax from 1 MeV up to 55 MeV [8].
Typical proton beam has picosecond duration and is
emitted in quasilaminar fashion [9]; it can have very low
transverse emittance [10]. Experiments indicate that the
proton energy increases with the laser intensity and it
depends also on the target (foil) thickness and the target
composition. It turns out that for given laser intensity
there is an optimal target thickness, at which the proton
energy is maximum [11]. Thus the important question,
what is the ion maximum achievable energy at given in-
tensity and how it scales with increasing intensity?

In this Letter we investigate the scaling laws of the ion
acceleration driven by a laser pulse at intensity I = 1020−
1022 (W/cm2)(µm/λ)2 from a double layer target with
multi-parametric Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. The
double layer target was suggested in Refs. [1] for a laser-
driven high-quality ion beam generation that can be used
in hadron therapy; this scheme was also demonstrated
with three-dimensional PIC simulations in Refs. [12].

In publications on the multi-MeV ion acceleration
driven by an intense laser from foil targets, several
regimes of acceleration can be found. For example, ions
can be accelerated by varying electrostatic potential of
the electron cloud expanding into vacuum, as shown in
Refs. [13] with diﬀerent models. In the case of thin foils,
the ion acceleration can occur in a regime, when the laser

pulse quickly sweeps signiﬁcant part of electrons away,
[1, 12, 14]. At high intensity, when the radiation pressure
of the laser ﬁeld become dominant, the plasma is accel-
erated so that almost all the energy of the laser pulse
is transformed into the ion energy, [5]. Below we show
that, according to our simulations, in the case of thin
targets and optimal laser pulse duration, the ion maxi-
mum energy scales as the square root of the laser pulse
power, as suggested in [14]. With increasing intensity,
the RPD regime comes into play and the ion maximum
energy becomes proportional to the laser pulse energy.

The laser-driven ion acceleration also depends on the
structure of the laser pulse. “Parasitic” parts of the laser
pulse such as a pre-pulse and an ampliﬁed spontaneous
emission (ASE) can substantially change the structure of
the solid target before the main part of the laser pulse
arrives, e. g., a pre-plasma can be formed. The eﬀect of
“parasitic” parts of the laser pulse on the ion acceleration
and dependence of the ion energy on the scale-length of
the pre-formed plasma was dicsussed in Refs. [15, 16, 17].
We study the simplest model, where the “clean” gaus-
sian p-polarized laser pulse, whithout “parasitic” parts,
is incident at right angle on a thin slab of ideal collision-
less plasma. The approximation of collisionless plasma
can be satisfactory when a femtosecond laser at inten-
sity & 1020 W/cm2 interacts with plasma slab, which is
a few laser wavelengths thick, even at solid density of
plasma. The laser pulse is characterized by the wave-
length λ, the dimensionless amplitude a, corresponding
to intensity I = a2I1, I1 = 1.368×1018 W/cm2×(µm/λ)2,
the length (FWHM) L and focal spot diameter (FWHM)
D. The target consits of two layers, the ﬁrst layer is
fully stripped aluminium and the second layer is a pro-
ton coating. The ﬁrst and second layers of the target are
described, respectively, by the electron density ne and
ne2, the thickness l and l2, the transverse (perpendicular
to the laser pulse direction) size w and w2.

We carried out two-dimensional (2D) PIC multi-
parametric simulations using a technique described in
[17]. In this technique a series of 2D PIC tasks with N
diﬀerent sets of the laser and target parameters is per-

formed simultaneously on the N processors of a multi-
processor supercomputer, using the massively-parallel
and fully vectorized code REMP, based on the PIC
method and the “density decomposition” scheme [18].
We analyze the dependence of the interaction outcomes
such as reﬂection, transmission and absorption coeﬃ-
cients, maximum ion and electron energy and kinetic
temperature, beam emittance, energy spread, the accel-
eration time and length, etc. on parameters of the laser
pulse and the target:
laser pulse intensity I, focal spot
size D and duration L/c, target density ne and thickness
l. In the simulations, the laser pulse initially propagates
along the x-axis in the simulation box with x × y size
251λ × 136λ; the transverse size of the target ﬁrst layer
is ﬁxed: w = 80λ, for the second layer it is w2 = D/2;
the second layer is 0.06λ thick, its density is such that
the number of ions in the ﬁrst layer in the longitudinal
direction is ∼ 103 times greater than the corresponding
number of protons. At chosen conditions, protons behave
almost like probe particles, thus we can analyze, almost
independently, both the proton acceleration and the ac-
celeration of heavier ions from the ﬁrst layer. Simula-
tions were performed on 720-processor HP AlphaServer
In each processor the grid consists
at JAERI-Kansai.
of 4016 × 2176 cells and a number of quasi-particles is
1.9 × 107, amounting to 6.3 × 109 of cells and 1.4 × 1010
of quasi-particles in total.

Fig. 1 shows how the maximum proton energy de-
pends on the target thickness and density and the laser
intensity for ﬁxed laser length L = 10λ and focal spot
size D = 10λ. The proton energy was taken at the time
when the proton acceleration dropped to 3% from max-
imum; the corresponding acceleration length is approx-
imately equal to the laser focal spot size. Frames (a)-
(e) represent results of 720 separate computational tasks
performed simultaneously in one run on 720-processor su-
percomputer, each point with coordinates (l, ne) at ﬁxed
intensity I corresponds to particular one-processor task.
The target thickness changes in the range l/λ = 0.1 − 5
(12 samples), the target density varies from ne = ncr to
100ncr (12 samples), where ncr = π/(reλ2) is the critical
density, re = e2/mec2 is the classical electron radius. The
intensity varies from I = 1020 to 1022W/cm2 × (µm/λ)2
(5 samples). Plasma slab with comparatively low density
and large thickness can be considered as a model of the
target modiﬁed by “parasitic” parts of the laser pulse.

In ﬁg. 1 the ion energy curves appears to be nearly
parallel to the contours of the product σ = nel, i. e. the
number of electrons in the longitudinal direction. We
call this parameter the critical depth of the plasma slab.
We see that the energy dependence on two parameters
l and ne degenerates to a dependence on only one pa-
rameter σ. Such a degeneracy is rather surprising if we
inspect the results of diﬀerent simulations with the same
σ. At small thickness l and large density ne the laser
pulse sweeps away a substantial part of electrons, the in-

2

duced strong Coulomb potential of the ﬁrst layer acceler-
ates protons, in accordance with the scenario described
in Refs. [1, 12, 14]. At large thickness and small density
the laser pulse penetrates throuhg the target and gener-
ates a strong quasi-static magnetic ﬁeld whose pressure
causes charge separation which accelerates protons near
the plasma-vacuum interface, similarly to the mechanism
suggested in Refs.
[17, 19]. The maximum energy gain
corresponds to some optimum critical depth σopt. For
decreasing σ < σopt, more and more laser pulse energy
is transmitted through the plasma slab. For increasing
σ > σopt, the laser pulse reﬂection becomes more and
more eﬃcient. The energy absorption turned out to be
optimal for the ion acceleration at σ = σopt. Fig. 1(f)
shows the dependence of the energy gain on the laser in-
tensity I and the critical depth σ. Varying the σ, one
can ﬁnd the minimum intensity which gives the desired
energy gain. In other words, at each intensity there is an
optimal σ which gives the maximum energy gain. The op-
timal critical depth almost linearly depends on the square
root of the laser intensity, σopt/ncrλ ≈ 3+0.4×(I/I1)1/2.
This is similar to the criteria of relativistic transparency
of a thin foil, derived in Refs. [20].

Fig. 2 shows the maximum proton energy vs the laser
length and the target thickness for diﬀerent laser in-
tensities and focal spots at ﬁxed plasma density ne =
100ncr. As above, the proton energy corresponds to the
time when the acceleration damped to 3% from max-
imum. The laser pulse length is chosen in the range
L/λ = 10 − 60 (6 samples), the target thickness is
l/λ = 0.125 − 5 (8 samples), the laser intensity sam-
ples are the same as above, the laser focal spot diameter
choices are D/λ = 10, 25, 50. We see that the energy
gain increases with decreasing target thickness and in-
creasing laser pulse length. Columns (b) and (c) indicate
that energy in the range 100-200 MeV is achievable with
a “clean” petawatt laser with sub-picosecond duration
when the solid density target is suﬃciently thin, as was
found in [21].

At intensity of the order of 5 × 1021W/cm2 × (µm/λ)2,
the new regime of acceleration comes into play, when the
energy gain rapidly increases with the laser pulse length
and, for optimal pair of laser duration and target thick-
ness, relativistic protons can be obtained. This is the
radiation pressure dominant regime of the ion accelera-
tion, described in [5] for much higher intensity. In this
case the laser radiation pressure dominates in the interac-
tion and the eﬀective cross-section of the process (analog
of the Thomson cross-section) becomes 2/nel, [5]. As
shown in Fig. 2, the energy gain decreases if the laser
duration is greater than the optimum. This is because
we use Gaussian laser pulses, so a long pulse head have
enough time to deteriorate the target. As indicated in
Refs. [5], in the ideal case of the RPD regime, the energy
gain is proportional to the laser pulse duration.

Figs. 3 and 4 are compiled from the results presented

above. In Fig. 3 the maximum proton energy Emax is
drawn for every instance of the laser pulse energy EL
in the case l = λ, ne = 100ncr. Points become arranged
along 3 lines corresponding to 3 versions of the focal spot
size; lines can be ﬁtted by scaling Emax ∝ E 0.8
up to
Emax . 200 MeV and by Emax ∝ EL for higher energy
gains when begins a transition to the RPD regime.

L

Fig. 4 shows a correlation of the maximum proton
energy with the laser power P for ne = 100ncr, where
points correspond to a thickness l close to optimal, i. e.
nel ≈ σopt. Narrowing the set of points by additional
constraint that the laser pulse length is of the order of
the focal spot size, L ∼ D, we obtain a strip aligned along
the dependence Emax ∝ P 1/2. Once again we see a de-
generation of a complex dependence of the ion maximum
energy from many parameters to a dependence from a
fewer number of parameters. This can be a manifesta-
tion of a distinct regime. In this case the conditions are
met for the regime described in Refs.
[1, 12, 14]. The
square-root dependence on the laser power is consistent
with the prediction made in Ref.
[14]. Following Refs.
[1, 12, 14], one can represent the irradiated spot as an
uniformly charged oblate ellipsoid with size l × D × D,
l < D, and charge density +ηene, where η is a portion of
electrons swept away by the laser pulse. Assuming that
the target critical depth is optimal, nel = 0.4 a ncrλ, one
can obtain the maximum energy of the ion with charge
Ze accelerated by the electric ﬁeld of the ellipsoid (for
l ≪ D): Emax ≈ ηZ(P[PW])1/2 × 228 MeV, where P is
the laser peak power. The condition that the optimal
laser pulse length should be greater than or of the order
of the focal spot size, L & D, turs out to be necessary
to prevent return currents from aﬀecting the ion acceler-
ation (both the current, formed by returning electrons,
and that, produced by electrons from a surrounding less
irradiated and relatively cold plasma).

In conclusion, our multi-parametric simulations show
that in the process of the ion acceleration by an intense
laser pulse from a double layer target, at given laser in-
tensity I the dependence of the ion maximum energy
from the target thickness l and density ne is reduced to a
dependence on the critical depth σ = nel. At given inten-
sity the highest ion energy gain occurs at optimal critical
depth of the target σopt which is approximately propor-
tional to the square root of intensity, σopt ∝ I 1/2. If the
target critical depth is less than the optimal value, the
laser pulse is more transmitted rather than absorbed; if it
is greater, the laser pulse reﬂection increases making the
interaction less eﬃcient for the ion acceleration. Simula-
tions indicate that in the case of thin targets and optimal
laser pulse duration, the ion maximum energy scales as
the square root of the laser pulse power, in consistence
[14]. Therefore, the
with the theory presented in Ref.
laser-driven ion acceleration up to 200-300 MeV, which
is necessary for hadron therapy, can be obtained with a
petawatt laser with sub-picosecond duration. A transi-

3

tion to the radiation pressure dominated regime of the
ion acceleration is revealed. With increasing intensity,
when the RPD regime comes into play, the ion maximum
energy becomes proportional to the laser pulse energy.

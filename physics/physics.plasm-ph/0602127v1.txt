In present paper we discuss the control of complex spatio-temporal dynamics in a spatially extended
non-linear system (ﬂuid model of Pierce diode) based on the concepts of controlling chaos in the
systems with few degrees of freedom. A presented method is connected with stabilization of unstable
homogeneous equilibrium state and the unstable spatio-temporal periodical states analogous to
unstable periodic orbits of chaotic dynamics of the systems with few degrees of freedom. We show
that this method is eﬀective and allows to achieve desired regular dynamics chosen from a number
of possible in the considered system.

The problem of controlling dynamics of non-
linear dynamical systems by stabilization of ex-
isting unstable periodical orbits divides into two
tasks. The ﬁrst of them is picking out and
analysing the periodical states. For this purpose
the algorithm of Lathrop and Kostelich and algo-
rithm of Schmelcher and Diakonos (SD–method)
are often used. The second task is stabilization
of unstable orbit.
In distributed systems the
role of unstable orbits is performed by spatio-
temporal periodical states. In our work we pro-
pose methods of picking out unstable periodical
spatio-temporal states with the help of modiﬁed
Kostelich and SD–methods for distributed beam-
plasma systems. Stabilization is realized with
the help of continuous delayed feedback, by the
method based on Pyragas works. The most at-
tractive feature of the proposed method is that
the continuous control signal is given to one of the
boundaries of the system what makes this method
convenient to use in practice, for example, for mi-
crowave beam-plasma systems.

Introduction

Practical use of unstable periodic orbits of chaotic at-
tractor for chaos controlling has been discussed in a num-
ber of papers since the the work of E. Ott, C. Grebogy,
J. Yorke [1] has been published.
In the works [2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9] it has been shown that unstable orbits of
chaotic attractor of a dynamical system with few degrees
of freedom can be used to control complex behaviour of

the system, and the stabilization of the unstable periodic
orbit needs small perturbation of the system dynamics.
The work [1] oﬀers an algorithm of chaos control, deﬁning
the change of the system parameter in the dependence of
the distance between the current state of the system and
the wanted orbit. The value and sign of the parameter
change can be discussed as the signal of some feedback.
This method can also be applied to ﬂow systems.

As it has been shown in a number of works [10, 11, 12,
13] the OGY algorithm is insensitive to noise and inexact
knowledge of the system state and it can be applied to
the systems with ﬁnite, but large degrees of freedom [14].
But it seems rather hard to apply the OGY algorithm
to control the dynamics of diﬀerent distributed chaotic
systems, including one we are discussing in this work, be-
cause it demands the explicit knowledge of system state
and the quick change of control parameter along the
whole system space.
It is nearly impossible to realize
in real microwave beam-plasma systems working in the
frequency rang 0.1 ÷ 100 GHz.

For such systems it seems more prospective to use the
method of stabilization of the unstable periodic states
In this work the contin-
suggested by K. Pyragas [15].
uous [16], and not discrete quickly changing feedback is
used, what makes this algorithm appropriate for the dis-
tributed microwave systems. In the Pyragas scheme the
system is synchronized with its own state taken one orbit
period earlier, by continuous change of control parame-
ter ε(t) = γ(ξ(t) − ξ(t − T )), where ξ(t) is the analyzed
variable, γ is the feedback coeﬃcient and T is the or-
bit period. When the stabilization of the unstable orbit
takes place, the feedback signal has the order of the noise
level. It is important that all the information demanded
for stabilization, except for T and γ, is contained in the
time series of the system dynamics ξ(t), i.e. is deﬁned au-
tomatically in real time. Applications of such controlling
scheme were theoretically and practically investigated in
diﬀerent systems and models [2, 16, 17, 18, 19] including
laser physics [20, 21, 22], models of geophysical processes
[23] and the processes of “reaction–diﬀusion” [24].

We must mark especially that this scheme with con-
tinuous feedback has been used for controlling spatio-
temporal chaos in distributed systems (see for exam-
ple works [24, 25, 26] devoted to stabilization of two-
dimensional structures in the 2D distributed chaotic sys-
tem, described by partial derivative equations; works
in which chaos control in the lattices of
[27, 28, 29],
coupled maps has been considered; the works analyzing
such sample equations as the complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation in non-linear dynamics [30, 31] or the Swift-
Hohenberg equation of laser physics [32, 33]). Among
such investigations we must mark works [24, 31] espe-
cially. Thus, in the work of Boccaletti [31] the problem
of chaos control in the Ginzburg-Landau model with the
use of a large (but ﬁnite) number of small local perturba-
tions has been investigated. This method allows to sta-
bilize the unstable structures of chaotic spatio-temporal
dynamics and to synchronize two chaotic states. Frances-
chini and the others in work [24] studied the problem of
controlling chaotic generation of impulses in the model
of uniformly coupled “reaction–diﬀusion” systems used
for describing the processes of charge transfer in bistable
semiconductor. The controlling feedback signal in math-
ematical model oﬀered in work [24] is supposed to be
spatially homogeneous, i.e. the perturbation carried into
every point of the system space is the same.
Some works describing chaos control

in microwave
beam–plasma systems must also be mentioned. The sta-
bilization of unstable periodic orbits in a ﬂuid model of
Pierce diode with the help of the OGY algorithm has
been discussed in work [34]. Work [35] discusses the prob-
lem of suppression of the regime of the virtual cathode
in Pierce diode [36, 37] with the help of delayed feedback
using a numerical method of large particles. In our work
[38] the inﬂuence of the external feedback on the chaotic
oscillations in Pierce diode has been examined.

It is important to note, that in the majority of works
devoted to chaos control in the distributed systems, the
controlling feedback signal eﬀects at every point of the
system space. Such distributed spatio-temporal control
can be used, for example, in optical systems [39, 40, 41].
But application of such methods to beam-plasma sys-
tems causes several diﬃculties. In the present work we
propose a method of chaos control based on the continu-
ous feedback scheme, where the feedback signal is given
to one of the boundaries of the distributed system. As
a sample this method is applied to widely known simple
distributed beam-plasma system (ﬂuid model of Pierce
diode)

As it has already been mentioned above, the knowledge
of the positions of the unstable orbits in the phase space
and their periods is quite important for controlling chaos
in the discrete and ﬂow systems with a small number of
degrees of freedom. We can say that in distributed sys-
tems the unstable periodic spatio-temporal states play
the roles of unstable orbits. Therefore, for the eﬃcient
chaos controlling we need to ﬁnd such unstable periodic
states. Accordingly, we propose a simple method of de-

tecting of unstable periodic spatio-temporal states and
their further stabilization.

The structure of the paper is following: In Section I the
ﬂuid model of Pierce diode is discussed. In Section II sta-
bilization of the unstable homogeneous equilibrium state
is described.
In Section III the spatio-temporal data
series of electron beam dynamics are analyzed and the
unstable periodic spatio–temporal states of the chaotic
dynamics are carried out. And, in Section IV we discuss
the stabilization of the unstable periodic spatio-temporal
states (unstable states) derived in Section III, with the
help of feedback of diﬀerent type. In conclusion we sum-
marize the main results discussed in our paper.

I. GENERAL FORMALISM

Pierce diode [36, 37] is one of the simplest beam-
plasma systems demonstrating complex chaotic dynamics
[37, 38, 42, 43, 44]. It consists of two plane parallel inﬁ-
nite grids pierced by the monoenergetic (at the entrance)
electron beam (see Fig. 1). The grids are grounded and
the distance between them is L. The entrance space
charge density ρ0 and velocity v0 are maintained con-
stant. The space between the grids is evenly ﬁlled by the
neutralizing ions with density |ρi/ρ0| = 1. The dynam-
ics of this system is deﬁned by the only parameter, the
so-called Pierce parameter

α = ωpL/v0,

(1)

where ωp is the plasma frequency of the electron beam.
With α > π in the system, the so-called Pierce instability
[36, 37] develops, which leads to the appearance of the
virtual cathode. At the same time, with α ∼ 3π, the
instability is limited by non-linearity and the regime of
complete passing of the electron beam through the diode
space can be observed. In this case the system can be
described by the ﬂuid equations:

with the boundary conditions:

v(0, t) = 1,

ρ(0, t) = 1, ϕ(0, t) = ϕ(1, t) = 0.

In equations (2)–(5) the non-dimensional variables
(space charge potential ϕ, density ρ, velocity v, space
coordinate x and time t) are used. They are related to
the corresponding dimensional variables as follows:

II. STABILIZATION OF UNSTABLE
EQUILIBRIUM SPATIAL STATE WITH THE
HELP OF THE CONTINUOUS DELAYED
FEEDBACK

Following the works mentioned above [16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24] devoted to chaos control in ﬁnite-
dimensional systems, we now describe the scheme of the
continuous delayed feedback for stabilization of the un-
stable equilibrium state in Pierce diode.

The continuous delayed feedback is realized by chang-

ing the potential of the right boundary of the system:

ϕ(x = 1.0, t) = ffb(t) = K(ρ(xﬁx, t) − ρ(xﬁx, t − d)), (8)

where K is the feedback coeﬃcient, d is the delay time.
Variable ρ(xﬁx, t) in (8) is the space charge density in a
ﬁxed point x = xﬁx of diode space (in the work we use
xﬁx = 0.2). When the stabilization regime takes place
and the system is exactly in the equilibrium state, the
feedback signal ffb could by compared with the noise
level.

Practically, this scheme of delaying feedback can be re-
alized, for example, with the help of delay lines on mag-
netostatic waves [47, 48] or acoustic waves [49, 50]. Such
method would allow to select the required delay time.
The signal can be picked out from the system using a
probe.

So, unlike works [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33],
where controlling the chaotic dynamics of the distributed
systems needs the eﬀect of the feedback signal upon
the whole interaction interval, in our scheme the signal
of the continuous delayed feedback determines only the
change of the boundary conditions. It is more convenient
to realize in experimental microwave devices. Then, in
real microwave systems working in the frequency range
0.1 ÷ 100 GHz, it is nearly impossible to realize the OGY
algorithm because it demands very quick changing of con-
trolling parameter.

It must be marked that we use the term continuous
feedback in analogy with works [15, 16]. This term
emphasizes that in our scheme the controlling signal is
changed continuously in contrast to the schemes based
on the OGY algorithm [1]. It is obvious that the control-
ling scheme (8) discussed in our work is more convenient
in practical use for controlling the dynamics of the dis-
tributed microwave systems.

For purpose of stabilization of the unstable equilibrium
state the delay time d of the feedback line (8) must be
small enough: d < Tp/2, where Tp = π/ωp is the typical
time scale in the autonomous distributed system [37].

Results of stabilization of the system (2)–(5) with the
help of the continuous feedback (8) are presented in
Fig. 2. The autonomous system displays chaotic oscilla-
tions with a large amplitude. But after switching on the
continuous feedback one can observe a fast decrease of the
amplitude of oscillations which leads to the stabilization
of the unstable state (7). After a short transient process
the controlling signal in the feedback line becomes rather

line

where the dotted symbols correspond to the dimensional
values, η is the speciﬁc electron charge, v0 and ρ0 are the
non-perturbed velocity and density of the electron beam,
L is the length of the diode space.

Equations (2) and (3) are numerically integrated with
the help of one-step explicit two-level scheme with up-
stream diﬀerences [37, 45, 46] and Poisson equation (4)
is solved by the method of the error vector propagation
[45]. The time and space integration steps have been
taken as ∆x = 0.0005, and ∆t = 0.0001, respectively.

In works [37, 42, 43] it was shown, that in the nar-
row range α ∼ 3π without the virtual cathode, one can
observe chaotic oscillations in the system. With a de-
crease of α from 2.88π to 2.86π the model demonstrates
a transition from periodic oscillations to chaos via a pe-
riod doubling cascade. Just below the critical value of α
the system demonstrates weak chaotic oscillations with
the explicit time scale. Below we will call this regime
“bond chaos” because the attractor in the reconstructed
phase space looks like a narrow bond on which the phase
paths are situated. With the further decrease of α the ex-
plicit time scale vanishes and the phase picture reminds
of spiral twisting from one point. The power spectrum
of the system oscillations is more complex in comparison
with the ﬁrst case. This type of chaotic behaviour we
call “spiral chaos”.

The stationary homogeneous equilibrium state of the
electron beam in Pierce diode is characterized by the fol-
lowing distribution of the system variables

¯v(x) = 1.0,

¯ρ(x) = 1.0,

¯ϕ(x) = 0.0,

(7)

that can be found from solutions of stationary equations
derived from non-stationary ﬂuid equations (2)–(4) in as-
sumption that ∂/∂t = 0.

Homogeneous equilibrium state (7) is stable with α <
π, and loses its stability at α > π as it has been shown by
J. Pierce [36]. In work [38] the signiﬁcance of the unsta-
ble a decrease of α or with the inﬂuence of the external
delayed feedback is shown.

rameters are K = 0.8, d = 0.15. The moment of appearance
of the delayed feedback is marked by an arrow and dotted
line.

small in comparison with the signal before stabilization
(near 0.01%). This means that the regime of chaos con-
trol with the help of small controlling signal of continuous
feedback takes place in the system.

It is important to ﬁnd the regions of feedback param-
eters K and d where chaos controlling is possible. Fig. 3
shows areas of the bond chaos regime (α = 2.862π) and
spiral chaos regime (α = 2.857π). One can see that the
regime maps (K, d) for both cases have qualitative sim-
ilarities. For small K, the system displays chaotic oscil-
lations similar to autonomous oscillations corresponding
to this α value (region C in Fig. 3). With an increase
of K one can observe the destruction of chaotic oscilla-
tions and appearance of periodical ones (region P ). In
this case the feedback signal is not small (its amplitude
has the same order of value as ffb before switching on
the feedback) hence we can not regard this regime as
the controlling chaos one. With further growth of K the
controlling chaos regime takes place (region S). The un-
stable homogeneous state is stabilized, and the system
dynamics in this case is shown in Fig. 2.

The width of region of stabilization S depends notice-
ably on the delay time d. The threshold values d1, d2,
determine the range d ∈ (d1, d2) where controlling pa-
rameter values allowing to obtain controlling chaos in
the distributed beam-plasma system are possible.

With the further increase of d and K, reﬂection and
overtaking of electrons appear in the electron beam (re-
gion V in Fig. 3), and therefore the ﬂuid equations (2)–(5)

FIG. 3: Regime maps of the stabilized system on the plane
of parameters (K, d) for cases of (a) bond chaos (α = 2.862π)
and (b) spiral chaos (α = 2.857π). The region of stabilization
of the unstable equilibrium state is hatched

become unﬁt (see [51, 52] for detail).

It is useful to note that in spiral chaos regime the region
S in the parameter map is narrower than that in bond
chaos regime (compare Fig. 3a and 3b).

We can analyse the stability of the discussed equilib-
rium state by calculating the maximum Lyapunov expo-
nent Λ [15]. For the feedback coeﬃcient K = 0 the values
of Lyapunov exponents of our system are equal to those
of the autonomous system.

Fig. 4 shows the dependence between the maximum
Lyapunov exponent Λ and the feedback coeﬃcient K for
two diﬀerent chaotic regimes. This dependencies deter-
mine the boundary of adaptability of our control method.
The suppression of the chaotic dynamics is possible only
for the values of K corresponding to Λ(K) < 0. These
are regions P and S in Fig. 3. The value of K for which
stabilization of unstable state takes place (region S in
Fig. 3) is marked by an arrow in Fig. 4. One can see that
the stabilization regime is preceded by the increase of
Lyapunov exponent, and beyond the boundary of stabi-
lization K = Kc the value Λ(K) decreases linearly. Such
behaviour is typical to both types of chaotic dynamics.

to the bond chaos regime (α = 2.862π), the solid line — to the
spiral chaos regime (α = 2.857π). The arrow marks the values
of Kc, corresponding to the onset of stabilization. d = 0.14

III. PICKING OUT UNSTABLE PERIODICAL
SPATIO-TEMPORAL STATES OF SPATIALLY
EXTENDED SYSTEM DYNAMICS

In this section we discuss the unstable periodic spatio-
temporal states of distributed active medium, analogous
to the unstable periodic orbits of a few-dimensional sys-
tems, which play an important role in the complex be-
havior of non-linear systems [53], in particular, in the
case of chaotic synchronization [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59].

The initial information about the set of unstable pe-
riodic orbits can be obtained from the histograms de-
scribing the frequency of system returning to the vicinity
of the orbits. This method was oﬀered by D.P. Lathrop
E.J. Kostelich [4]. We choose a phase point Ri on the
attractor. If this point is close to an unstable cycle with
a period T , then the phase trajectory passing the points
Ri+1, Ri+2, . . . , Rk, will come near the initial state with
some precision ε > 0:

||Ri − Ri+m|| < ε,

(9)

where m = T /∆t is the orbit period in discrete time
unit. Then the distribution of return time (histogram) is
made. By this histogram it is easy to carry out the typical
periods of corresponding unstable states, and then to ﬁnd
the unstable cycles.

For the study of unstable spatio-temporal states of the
dynamics of the explored distributed system we inves-
tigate the time oscillations of the space charge density
ρ(x0, t), obtained from the ﬁxed points of the interac-
tion space x0. Then, from the time series ρ(x0, t), using
Takens’ method [60] the attractors of system dynamics
are restored in pseudo-phase space Rn. Using Lathrop

jectory to the ﬁxed attractor points, associated with diﬀerent
recurrence time: (a) α = 2.861π; (b) α = 2.857π

& Kostelich algorithm we pick out the periodical orbits
in Rn and then hence ﬁnd the spatio-temporal periodical
states of the distributed system.

In Fig. 5 the histograms of return time obtained for
diﬀerent values of Pierce parameter are presented. One
can see that in the bond chaos regime (Fig. 5) one of the
orbits dominate upon the others i.e. it is more frequently
visited by phase point.

For spiral chaos regime (Fig. 5b) the set of unstable
orbits is more complex, and the diﬀerent unstable peri-
odical states are visited more evenly and frequently.

Histograms of recurrence time obtained for time series
ρ(x, t), taken from diﬀerent points of diode space x = x0

are very much alike. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.
follows from the picture that the set of unstable spatio–
temporal states is identical along the diode interval. A
slight diﬀerence can be caused by inaccuracy in calculat-
ing the recurrence time (see, for example, the unstable
spatio–temporal states with T = 4.173 in Fig. 6a and
Fig. 6c (marked by an arrow)). The latter allows to carry
out and to analyse some characteristics of the unstable
spatio-temporal states of the distributed system using
scalar time series obtained from one ﬁxed point xf ix of
interaction interval.

In Fig. 7 the unstable periodical states of the dis-
tributed system are shown. The three-dimensional pic-

6

FIG. 7: Unstable periodical orbits of diﬀerent periods T in
the regime of spiral chaos: (a) T = 4.173 and (b) T = 18.987

are reconstructed from histograms, at ﬁrst we deter-
mine the system state vector R in phase space. As
a state vector in this case a vector is taken com-
bined from the density of charge taken from the
diﬀerent points of the interaction space: R(t) =
{ρ(x = 0.25, t), ρ(x = 0.5, t), ρ(x = 0.75, t)}T .

In reconstructed phase space a plane ρ(x = 0.25, t) =
1.0 is taken, which is considered as Poincare section. Let
us indicate as Rn the system state corresponding to the
nth crossing between phase part and the selected section.
(this crossing takes place at moment of time tn). Then
the description of the system can be made with the help
of discrete map like

Rn+1 = G(Rn),

(10)

where G(·) is the evolution operator. Obviously, it is im-
possible to ﬁnd the analytical form for the operator G,
but numerical integration of the initial system of ﬂuid
equations can give us a consecution of values {R}n, de-
rived from the map (10).

SD–method for picking out unstable periodic orbits
supposes examination of modiﬁed model of a distributed
system, described by following map [9]:

Rn+1 = Rn + λC [G(Rn) − Rn] .

(11)

In the works [5, 9] it is exactly shown that such modi-
ﬁed system in the case of analysis of discrete systems and
the systems with few degrees of freedom allows to stabi-
lize eﬀectively the unstable periodical orbits of the initial
system, which in the case of modiﬁed system transform
from saddle into stable ones (11). Application of the SD–
method to the analysis of distributed system is also ef-

FIG. 6: Histograms of recurrence time for α = 2.857π ob-
tained from the data taken from diﬀerent points of diode
space: (a) x0 = 0.2, (b) x0 = 0.5, (c) x = 0.8

tures show the spatio-temporal oscillations of the space
charge density ρ(x, t) which correspond to the unstable
periodical orbit states with diﬀerent period. The pictures
are obtained for α = 2.857π (spiral chaos).

We must pay attention that the similar results has
been derived when the unstable periodic spatio-temporal
states by the method of P. Schmelcher F. Diakonos (SD–
method) [5, 9], adapted for the analysis of distributed
system. The algorithm is the follows.

As in the case when the unstable periodic states

and C is a matrix, which, following to work [9] was taken
as

C =

.

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(12)

Modiﬁed map (11) allows only to deﬁne unstable pe-
riodic state of lowest period T1, which agrees with the
single crossing of the selected Poincare section during
time T1. To ﬁnd the unstable states with higher period
Tp, when the phase path crosses the Poincare section for
p times during the period Tp, it is necessary to take a
modiﬁed map like

Rn+1 = Rn + λC [Gp(Rn) − Rn] ,

(13)

where Gp(·) is p times iterated map G(·) (i.e. when nu-
merical solution of the system of ﬂuid equations is found
and then the map is reconstructed (13) it is necessary
to take into account only the every pth crossing of the
Poincare section by phase path, where p is obviously in-
teger.

So, by numerical integration of the map (13) with
diﬀerent values of p one can ﬁnd the unstable spatio-
temporal states that appear to be stable in the modiﬁed
system, described by the map (13). So, the result of nu-
merical integration of modiﬁed system (ﬂuid equations
taking into account the procedure (13))) is a periodic so-
lution, which agrees with the unstable periodic state of
the initial system.
The numerical

integration of the modiﬁed system
causes only one diﬃculty. When we are searching for
the state Rn+1 at the moment tn+1, then, according to
formula (13) we know only the coordinates of this state
in Poincare section but we don’t know the correspond-
ing distribution of space charge density ρ(x, tn+1), ve-
locity v(x, tn+1) of the electron beam and the potential
φ(x, tn+1). To derive the mentioned space functions we
use the following procedure. The system of ﬂuid equa-
tions describing Pierce diode is integrated till some state
Rs of the system would not be close to the selected state
Rn+1 with some demanded precision: ||Rn+1 − Rs|| < δ,
where δ is taken as δ = 10−3. When this condition is
fulﬁlled, the space functions corresponding to the state
Rs are considered as the space distributions Rn+1 and
then the next iteration according to (13) takes place.

As numerical modelling shows, the modiﬁed SD–
method applied to distributed system is convergent and
allows to ﬁnd the demanded periodical time-space states.
The convergence of the procedure is illustrated by Fig. 8,
which shows the dependance of the space charge density
ρ(x = 0.25) in the moment when the point in pseudo-
phase space crosses the Poincare section upon the num-
ber of iteration n of the SD–method when the unsta-
ble state of period 1 is deﬁned (p = 1). One can see
clearly that the iteration process of SD–method con-

verges to the value corresponding to the unstable time-
periodical spatio-temporal state of the system. Fig. 9
shows the time series of ρ(t, x = 0.2), corresponding to
unstable periodic states of diﬀerent order p and period T
with α = 2.858π, picked by SD–method. We mark that
the derived spatio-temporal distributions agrees very well
with the distributions of unstable states derived earlier
by analysing of the return time histograms.

As quantitative characteristics of the derived unsta-
ble orbits it is useful to analyze the maximum Lyapunov
exponent Λ of every orbit. Calculation of this value is
important for further stabilization of periodical spatio-
temporal states.

IV. STABILIZATION OF THE UNSTABLE
PERIODICAL STATES

As simplest scheme of stabilization of unstable period-
ical orbits described in the previous section, we can take
the scheme (8) where the feedback signal is formed as:

ϕ(x = 1.0, t) = f T

fb(t) =

= K(ρ(xﬁx, t) − ρ(xﬁx, t − Tk)) = Kξ(t).

(14)

Here K is again the feedback coeﬃcient and Tk is the
delay time equal to the period of the k-th unstable orbit.
As in the case of stabilization of unstable equilibrium
state, we choose the ﬁxed point of the diode space xﬁx =
0.2, from which the feedback signal is taken.

The numerical modelling shows that this scheme is
rather eﬀective for stabilization of the unstable periodical
state with the lowest period T1. Fig. 10 shows the spatio–
temporal dynamics of the system in cases of autonomous
oscillations and in the regime of stabilization (the value
of the space charge density ρ(x, t) is shown by colour nu-
ances scaling). One can easily observe that there are pe-
culiarities of the complex spatio-temporal behaviour and
transitions between chaotic and periodic regimes. It is
obvious from the picture that the periodic dynamics anal-
ogous to the system behaviour near the unstable state is
stabilized during approximately 2÷3 time periods T1 (see
Fig. 7a).

We also study the peculiarities of the inﬂuence of de-
layed feedback (14) upon the investigated system by ex-
amining how the feedback amplitude K acts upon the
maximum Lyapunov exponent Λ and the average of the
feedback signal

regime (a) and in the regime of stabilization of the periodic
orbit T = 4.173 (b). The arrow and dotted line in b shows
the moment of switching on the delayed feedback

where τ ≫ d. The corresponding plots derived for d = T1
are presented in Fig. 11.

When K is small the system demonstrates chaotic os-
cillations similar to the oscillations in the autonomous
regime (in Fig. 12a, one can see the time series of the
space charge oscillations for x = 0.2 without feedback).
With an increase of K the complexity of the oscilla-
tions diminishes (the value of Λ decreases) and at the
same time the amplitude of the feedback signal becomes
smaller. In some region of K the feedback signal is close
to zero and the maximum Lyapunov exponent Λ < 0 (the
grey area in Fig. 11). In this case the spatio-temporal dy-
namics is the same as that of the unstable periodic state.
Thus, it is the regime of chaos stabilization, illustrated
by Fig. 12b,c, which shows the oscillations of the space
charge density in the system and the feedback signal,
correspondingly.

Examining the graph Λ(K) we also must note the re-
gions where the feedback signal hξi is not small but the
value Λ < 0. These regimes are marked in Fig. 11 as P
and correspond to periodic oscillations near the unsta-
ble orbit. The space charge oscillations and the feedback
signal for this case are presented in Fig. 12d,e. We also
pay attention to the fact, that with large K the system
demonstrates the period doubling based on the regime
P (region marked as P 2 in Fig. 11). For K > 0.15 in
the system the growth of the oscillation amplitude takes
place, and reﬂection of electrons appears. Thus, in this

(solid line) and the mean feedback signal (doted line) upon
the feedback coeﬃcient K in the spiral chaos regime (α =
2.857π). Region C (grey colour) corresponds to the regime
of stabilization of the unstable periodic state of period 1 T =
4.173 (the feedback signal is close to null hξi ≈ 0). Region P
corresponds to periodic oscillations, when the feedback signal
is large and the maximum Lyapunov exponent Λ < 0; region
P 2 corresponds to the regime of period doubling

region we can not use any more the ﬂuid equations for
the description of the system [51, 52].

But the computer experiment shows that stabilization
of the unstable orbits with higher periods Tk > T1 =
4.173 using feedback scheme (14) is impossible. The anal-
ysis of the chaos controlling schemes like (14) applied to
the systems with few degrees of freedom, has shown [62]
that the eﬀective stabilization of the unstable periodic
orbits is possible only when the values of the maximum
Lyapunov exponent λ and the orbit period τ fulﬁll the
following condition

λτ ≤ C,

(16)

where C is constant depending on the system.

Thus, we must modify the controlling scheme (14) so
that it would be possible to stabilize the orbits with
higher period Tk. The scheme, which we consider, is
a modiﬁcation of the method worked out by K. Pyragas
[15]. As it follows from the result of the numerical ex-
periment [63], in the few-dimensional non-linear systems
this scheme allows to stabilize the unstable orbits for
which the condition (16) does not fulﬁll. The main idea
of the method [63] is the following: the feedback sig-
nal is formed so that not only the system state at the
moment (t − Tk) inﬂuences upon it, as it was in the pre-
vious scheme, but also the states at the moments of time
(t − mTk) do, with some weight coeﬃcients. Following

time series ρs(xﬁx, t) in the stabilized system (K = 0.07, d =
T = 4.173) (b), feedback signal ffb(t) (c); time series ρp(xﬁx, t)
and ffb(t) (d,e) in periodic oscillation regime (Λ < 0) (K =
0.035, d = T = 4.173), α = 2.857π (spiral chaos regime). The
moment of switching on the feedback is marked by an arrow
and a dotted line.

work [24], we assume that the described scheme could be
eﬀective in the controlling dynamics of the distributed
chaotic system.

The continuous feedback for stabilization of the un-
stable periodic states of higher period Tk > T1 can be
described by the following expression

ϕ(x = 1.0, t) = Kξ(t) =

M

= K

(1 − r)

rm−1 (ρ(xﬁx, t) − ρ(xﬁx, t − md))

,

 

m=1
X

!
(17)
where the delay time d is taken equal to the period of the
stabilized periodic orbit Tk, M is large enough (M ≫ 1),
and r (0 ≤ r < 1) characterizes the contribution of the

previous system’s states into the feedback signal: small
values of r correspond to the small signiﬁcance of the
previous states in the signal (17), and analogously, cor-
respond to the large ones. The case r = 0 corresponds
to the simplest scheme (14) of continuous feedback dis-
cussed above. Such feedback scheme (17) can be realized
in practice, for example, by using a set of acoustic time
delay lines each with its own delay time and transfer con-
stant. As it follows from works [24, 64, 65], a possibility
of stabilization of the orbits of highest period Tk (16)
appears with the growth of r, for which the use of the
scheme (14) is impossible. For example, in the work [62]
it is shown that with the help of the scheme similar to
(17) it is possible to stabilize the unstable periodic states
for which the following estimation condition is fulﬁlled:

ΛT ≤ C

1 + r
1 − r

.

(18)

Using the scheme (17) for the stabilization of the peri-
odic orbits which fulﬁlls the condition (18), the explicit
knowledge of the orbit period Tk is needed.
If the de-
lay time d diﬀers even slightly from the real period Tk,
it is impossible to stabilize the unstable periodic state
of the system, and in the feedback line one can observe
periodic oscillations ξ(t) with the amplitude exceeding
signiﬁcantly the noise level in the system. As numerical
analysis shows, stabilization is possible only when the
orbit period is known with the precision ε < 0.01%.

For more accurate deﬁnition of the orbit periods Tk
the following method presented in work [66] for the sys-
tems with few degrees of freedom and approbated for
distributed systems in the work [24] is used.

If the delay time d is not explicitly “tuned” to the orbit
period Tk then the maximum Lyapunov exponent is neg-
ative and in the feedback line one can observe the oscilla-
tions with the amplitude exceeding signiﬁcantly the noise
level of the system and the “base” period Θ 6= Tk, which
depends upon K and d (see. Fig. 12d,e).
In work [62]
the analytical dependence between the unknown explicit
period Tk of the unstable state, feedback parameters K,
d and the period Θ has been found as follows:

Θ(K, d) = Tk +

(d − Tk) + O((d − T )2).

(19)

K
K − g

Here g is the unknown parameter which is deﬁned by the
type of the non-linear dynamical system and depends on
the form of the delayed feedback. Thus, in expression
(19) there are two unknown values: the period Tk of the
unstable periodic state and the parameter g.

Let us take two sets of values (K1, d1), (K2, d2), where
the values of d1,2 are chosen close to the period of the
stabilized orbit, and then ﬁnd the corresponding Θ1 and
Θ2. Then we ﬁnd numerically the solution of the sys-
tem of two non-linear equations (19) and determine the

10

values g and Tk. Then we repeat the procedure taking
the newly deﬁned Tk as d. After a number of such it-
erations the period of the unstable orbit Tk, would be
deﬁned with absolutely satisfactory precision and then
the scheme (17) could be used for stabilization of this
state.

Numerical analysis shows that with the help of this
method it is possible to stabilize the orbits with the pe-
riod T < 25.0. The unstable states with higher period
turned out to be impossible to stabilize, though in the
system the periodic oscillations can be observed, but the
form of these oscillations is not close to the concerned un-
stable state and the feedback signal is not small. With
the growth of the period T of the stabilized orbit it was
necessary to enlarge the parameters M and r to achieve
the eﬀect of controlling chaos. Simultaneously, the range
of value of the feedback coeﬃcient K, for which stabi-
lization of the unstable state is possible, narrows.

Stabilization of the orbits of highest period is illus-
trated by Fig. 13. The feedback scheme parameters M ,
r and K are deﬁned in the cutline. The explicit values
of the periods T are deﬁned according to the method de-
scribed above. In Fig. 13 the orbits of the period T ≈ 8,
T ≈ 16 and T ≈ 23 are shown. The latter is the unstable
orbit with the highest period which appears to be possi-
ble to stabilize in spiral chaos regime (α = 2.857π) with
the help of the discussed scheme.

Conclusion

In this work the method of controlling complex chaotic
dynamics of the spatially distributed active medium
“electron beam with overcritical current in Pierce diode”
is discussed. The described method is based on the ideas
of controlling chaos in non-linear systems with few de-
grees of freedom. The scheme of continuous delayed feed-
back, which is used for controlling, allows to stabilize the
unstable equilibrium state of the distributed system and
the unstable periodic spatio–temporal states analogous
to the unstable periodic orbits of the chaotic attractor in
the systems with few degrees of freedom.

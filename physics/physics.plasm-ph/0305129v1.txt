Abstract

We use a systematic method which allows us to identify a class
of exact solutions of the Flierl-Petvishvili equation. The solutions are
periodic and have one dimensional geometry. We examine the physical
properties and ﬁnd that these structures can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the zonal ﬂow generation.

1 Introduction

The problem of coherent structures has been extensively investigated in con-
nection with the drift wave modes in tokamak. Numerical simulations and
experimental observations have provided strong evidence of the presence of
long-lived, cuasi-coherent structures even in deep turbulent regimes. The
theoretical models (close to similar descriptions in the physics of ﬂuids, at-
mosphere and ocean) emphasize the role of two types of nonlinearity : scalar
(or Korteweg deVries-type) and vectorial (convection of the vorticity). Both
are able to support vortical ﬂow in a form of coherent and long lived struc-
tures. The problems of generation from initial conditions and the stability
of monopolar or multipolar vortices are subjects of intense research and one
of the notable result is that not all of these structures can be expected to
be solitons in the sense of the Inverse Scattering Method. Usually they are
called solitary waves or solitary vortices. A review, mainly oriented to plasma
physics applications, has been done by Horton and Hasegawa [1].

The Hasegawa-Mima-Charney equation, modiﬁed by the inclusion of the
scalar nonlinearity shows the possibility of generation of monopolar vortices,

not solitonic but very robust and long lived. The one-dimensional version of
this equation, when the vectorial nonlinearity can be neglected, is the modi-
ﬁed Korteweg De Vries (mKdV) equation [2] and has been derived in various
contexts in plasma physics. Tasso [3] and later Petviashvili [4] have derived
versions of this equations applicable to the case where there is a strong tem-
perature gradient. It has been shown [6], [18] that the equation proposed was
in fact exclusively dependent of the density gradient. Later the equation has
been rederived along with a careful analysis of the scales involved [19]. In
the study of ocean ﬂows Flierl [7] has independently formulated an equation
with the same structure. A one dimensional version of the equation has been
solved by Lakhin et al. on an inﬁnite domain [6], obtaining as solution the
KdV soliton. Although the physical content of the functions appearing as
coeﬃcients in these equations is diﬀerent, the same general form has been
treated by Petviashvili et al. keeping the two-dimensional character (in view
of a possible decsription of the Jupiter ’s red-spot) [5]. They have found
a solution using trial functions to extremize a functional derived from the
equation. The solution is vortical monopolar. Boyd and Tan [8] have found
a monopolar solution expressed as a sum of 44 terms depending on the ra-
dial coordinate r through trigonometric functions. They have also proved the
non-existence of stable non-axisymmetric solutions to the stationary Flierl-
Petviashvili equation [9]. There is a strong connection between the stationary
Flierl-Petvishvili equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation [10], a two-
dimensional generalization of the KdV equation, for which numerical results
are available[11]. For simpler reference it is uses also the name Regularized
Long Wave equation, RLW, since the equation proposed by Peregrine [12]
can be brought to the same form.

The stationary two-dimensional equation derived in the studies mentioned
above has a very simple structure. and a one-dimensional solution is known,
the KdV soliton. We will examine the possible extension to an analytical
closed form of a two dimensional solution. We are motivated by the studies
of plasma ion mode instabilities, in particular the generation of localised
layers of sheared ﬂow (zonal ﬂow).

2 The scalar nonlinearity equation

In plasma physics applications, the Flierl-Petviashvili equation has the form

where α and β are physical parameters, i.e. functions depending on (x, y).
This equation is obtained as the stationary version of the equation which has

(cid:17)

The dependence on x is only parametric here, via the coeﬃcients α and β.
This has the same form as the KdV soliton solution.

Assuming that α and β are constants, this solution can be extended
indeﬁnitely in the transversal (x) direction, as a ridge propagating in the y
direction whose section is given by Eq.(3). If the plasma is homogeneous,
this ridge can be rotated arbitrarly in plane. We have then a family of quasi
two dimensional solutions to the Eq.(1).

We will discuss the possibility to ﬁnd other solutions of the two-dimensional

version of the equation.

3 Starting from the one dimensional problem

We can directly integrate the one dimensional version of the equation (1).
Actually, the solution (3) is one of the possible solutions arising from the
direct integration. For a reason that will become clear later, we write the
one dimensional version of the equation (1) in the form

where iη can be y as in Eq.(2). Multiplying by dφ/dη and integrating once
we have

The integral is elliptic and its inverse φ (η) has a closed analytical expression

These formulas can be found in Ref.[13]. More generally, the function φ can
be expressed in terms of the doubly periodic elliptic Weierstrass function,
℘ (η), which covers the particular cases presented above.

We note the similarities with the KdV equation [14]. The KdV equation

can be transformed to the Weierstrass form and has as solution

u (x, t) =

℘ (x + ct)

which is precisely the form we obtain for our equation. We conclude that the
Flierl-Petviashvili equation and the KdV equation both have the same solu-
tion expressed in terms of the Weierstrass doubly periodic elliptic function.

4 Constructing the solution from singulari-

ties

In view of the application to the description of plasma drift wave, a two-
dimensional solution would be very useful. We already dispose of the one-
parameter family of solutions with geometry of fronts, which has been ob-
tained by simply translating a one-dimensional solution along the transversal
direction. We examine a class of solutions that can be seen an extension from
the one-dimensional ones. We propose a more systematic approach of con-
struction which makes explicit the nature of the restriction leading to this
quasi-one dimensional geometry.

We will start from the one dimensional model, taking the coeﬃcients

constants. The only analytical formula for a solution of (1) is [6]

where

(note that in Lakhin et al. the coeﬃcient must be corrected by dividing with
2). We will use the following relation

We are looking for solutions φ (x, y) of the 2D equation and we try to
build them from the motion of the pole singularities of the one-dimensional
solution. More speciﬁcally, we will make an ansatz for the form of the 2D
solution based on a particular choice of poles in the complex y plane, as
suggested by Eq.(4). We will assume that the poles have positions that
depend on the other coordinate, x. Imposing that the function constructed
in this way veriﬁes the equation we obtain a set of diﬀerential equations and
constraint conditions for the positions of the poles in the complex y plane.
The poles evolve with x as time-like variable. Expressed in other terms, we
look for a function that is meromorphic in the complex y plane and whose
poles depend on x. We ﬁnd, following other similar approaches, that the
solution is an elliptic function, i.e. a doubly periodic meromorphic function
of y, for all values of x.

This procedure has been deveoped in the context of the exactly integrable
diﬀerential equations like Kortweg de Vries. We follow closely the methods
exposed in papers of Choodnovsky [16], Thickstun [15]. The work of Decon-
inck and Segur [17] is particularly relevant for our problem.

The following ansatz is suggested by the theory of τ -functions in the

integrable equations context [14]

On the other hand, there is also the suggestion from Eq.(4) that the function

5.1 Extending by inclusion of the x coordinate

The x dependence in this equation comes from the dependence on the variable
x of the position yn (x) of the poles in the complex y plane. Now we impose

5.2 Discussion of the constraint equation

We have obtained the equations and the constraint using an expansion around
a singularity yp. The choice is arbitrary and we can repeat the calculations
using another singularity. Obviously, the form of the equations will not be
changed. However we will obtain a number of constraints equal to the number
of singularities.

A simpler form of the constraint can be written.

Regarding the determination of the constants cp, p = 1, ..., N we note
that the condition (18) only says that the diﬀerences between the values
must be a multiple of πi. However, there is the additional constraint that
the constants cannot vanish. This is because the function would present
singularities in the real space variable. On the other hand, the singularities
must be placed symmetrically along the imaginary axis. These makes three
restriction imposed to the choice of the constants of integration

1. the initial constraint, Eq.(15) which has been trasformed into Eq.(18)

2. the restriction cp 6
3. the symmetrical positions along the imaginary axis, in order to have

We will assume in the following that the number of poles is inﬁnite,

However this will be discussed in more detail below.
The problem of ennumeration of poles with

x disappears but we will
have to make all steps separately for the two families. The fact that we
can choose only two families is related to the impossibility to satisfy the
constraints in the case when we would choose arbitray combinations of the

At this moment an important comment should be done. As we have seen
the solution of the constraint equation can be obtained on the basis of the
comparison with the identity Eq.(16). We observe that the upper limit of
the summation in (16) is interpreted as the number of poles,

On the other hand we were led to identify

Since we consider an inﬁnite number of poles, N
, this means that D is
inﬁnite. This is necessary since we later use the identity (19) where the sum-
mation is extended over an inﬁnite number of integer values n. Since however
we ﬁnd that L2 = D, this implies that the period L2 of the Weierstrass func-
tion ℘ is inﬁnite. Certainly this is not acceptable in this particular approach,
(but in general it is meaningful) and this shows that the identiﬁcation using
Eq.(19) can only be an approximation. This also means that the solution
can only be approximative. However, if we decide to use this approximative
identiﬁcation, we have to understand in what consists this approximation
and where we can expect to intervene the error we have introduced by that.
We ﬁrst note that the number of terms which is required in (19) to obtain
a good approximation of the Weierstrass function is not necessarly large, for
a signiﬁcant area in the perodicity parallelogram of the complex argument.
This means that actually D can be taken ﬁnite and in this case the use of
Eq.(16) becomes legitimate. What is the number of poles, N and accord-
ingly the length of periodicity L1 = D in a reasonable approximation? From
numerical experience it may be accepted that about ﬁve terms in the sum-
mation determining the Weierstrass function gives a reasonable result. Then
the number of poles retained in the sums (i.e. s
1 = N) can be a few units
and this also means that D

6.1 Basic information on the Weierstrass elliptic func-

tion (lemniscate type)

The most important consequence of the calculations that have been pre-
sented is the conﬁrmation, by the method of motion of poles, of the class of
quasi-one-dimensional solutions. In the absence of a systematic integration
procedure (like Inverse Scattering Transform) we can be at least sure that
this class represents a signiﬁcant part of the space of solutions.

Even if Eq.(21) is the result of an approximation, it clearly shows that the
solution should be searched in a form of a double periodic elliptic Weierstrass
function. This function has appeared in our calculations independently of any
attempt to integrate a one-dimensional version of the equation.

We now turn to the solutions of the constraint equations deﬁning u. It is

where a, b and τ can be complex. The following condition results

In addition, a choice of a and b real numbers, which makes the ﬁrst two
terms in (35) purely imaginary, should be coroborated with the suggestion
from Eq.(20) where the poles resulted shifted with a symmetric quantity
with respect to the real axis. This time, due to the change of variables (25)
everything is rotated. This yields the choice for τ as half of the period (2ω)
on the real axis

The second Weierstrass coeﬃcient g3 is left unspeciﬁed but it must be con-

We conclude that an exact solution to the Petviashvilli equation with

constant coeﬃcients α and β is

Now we understand the nature of the choice which is implicitely done
when we discuss the solutions consisting of arbitrarly rotated ridges issued
by translating one-dimensional proﬁles. It means to remain in the class of
functions u whose Laplacean is zero and the gradient is constant, according
to the conditions (29). Or, it can easily be seen that the only functions that
verify these conditions have the form of linear combinations of the variables
x and y.

8 The physical relevance of this periodic so-

lution

As a mathematical result, Eq.(36) is the exact response to the problem of
solving the Eq.(1). The physical problem, as usual, is more complicated.
The coeﬃcients α and β which we have assumed constants actually have a
certain space variation. We think however that it is worth examining the
consequences of this solution for the nonlinear plasma models.

In order to discuss possible physical applications of this solution we have
to handle easily its numerical form. Although we have assumed that the two
parameters α and β are constants, we will make estimations on the base of
their physical origin. For this we remind that the basic physical constants
are (Lakhin et al. [6], Spatscheck [18], Horton and Hasegawa [1])

As will become later more clear, our problem has led to a deﬁnition of the
Weierstrass function with only one coeﬃcient , g2 , ﬁxed by the conditions,
while g3 cannot be made precise. This is because the equation we have used
is the diﬀerential equation for the second derivative, ℘′′ (u) and this equation
only depends on g2.

The space variation of the physical coeﬃcients α and β are only in the
radial x direction and is in general weak. The contribution of this part to
the estimated value of g2 is approximately one tenth from the ﬁrst part.

We chose a factor of scale s for the ﬁnal amplitude of the part coming
form ℘ in the potential perturbation. This is a parameter that will result in
general from the physical initial conditions. We take

For the following calculations, we leave g3 a free parameter. We use a
computer code that calculates the value of the Weierstrass function for any
complex argument, by reducing everything at a fundamental paralleogram
with sides equal with 1 on the real as well as on the imaginary axis. This
means that the real part of the argument must be scaled with (2ω) and the
imaginary part of the argument must be scaled with (2ω′). After calculating
the argument of the Weierstrass function, the value to be inserted in the
subroutine is

This gives a ﬁrst estimation of the width of the layer along the x direction:

which means about 1 cm. We calculate the proﬁle of the streamfunction
φ (y, x) on a poloidal-radial domain of extension (40ρs ×

For example, we show the structure of the solution in the two plots.
This simple physical model does not take into account dissipative mech-
anism which would reduce the fast potential variation in the region close to
the separatrices. Using the homogeneity property of the Weierstrass function,
the amplitude may be connected to the width of the periodicity layer and this

locity. However, in the absence of detailed dissipative physical mechanisms,
the amplitude cannot be directly used for estimation of the ﬂuid ﬂow and
this led us to focus on the geometrical properties of the ﬂow pattern.

It is interesting to examine the structure of the ﬂow ﬁeld induced by the
potential as a function of the position along the minor radius in tokamak.

9 Conclusion

It has been known from the experiments on Rayleigh-Benard convection that
at higher Reynolds number there is a second bifurcation (the ﬁrst being from
purely conducting to convective rolls phase) where the pattern of the ﬂuid
ﬂow exhibits tilted structures. Close to the upper and to the lower bound-
aries there is a deformation of the rolls, the “wind” as has been designated,
which signiﬁcantly enhaces the Reynolds stress and favorizes second insta-
bility and eventually global displacement of the ﬂuid along the boundaries.
This ﬁnding, supported independently by suggestive results from the numer-
ical simulations of the ITG instability led to the idea that a tilting instability
may favorise, by an increase of the Reynolds stress, the generation of zonal
ﬂow in plasma. The solutions we have found is a new factor that should be
included in this physical description.

Certainly, the tilt of the radially elongated eddies speciﬁc to the ITG
potential pattern can be favorable to the spontaneous generation of sheared
poloidal ﬂow. On the other hand, the solution we have found has a strong
similarity to the tilted cells and zonal ﬂows. It may be possible that after a
certain degree of tilting is attained, the plasma evolves spontaneously to a
solution of the type described above. This solution intrinsically consists of
layers of sheared ﬂow. What is more important is that this solution has all
the usual attributes of an exactly integrable structure: it is more robust and
may represent an attractor. It can be considered that relating the generation

Appendix A : Discussion on the weak space
variation of the parameters

In order to obtain the exact solution we had to assume that the coeﬃcients
are constant. Later, we have considered a weak variation of the coeﬃcients
with the coordinate x, induced by the presence of the physical parameters.
We can assume that this is a reasonable representation of the real situation
only if we have an adiabatic variation of g2 with the physical parameters.

The numerical study of the dependence of the elliptic function on the
physical parameters shows that g2 is indeed slowly varying and that the
correction due to the second term in the expression of g2 can be neglected.
One can see that the weaker restriction can be formulated as follows: g2
is independent on u = iay + ibx + ω, which means that g2 is constant along
the lines ay + bx = const and can only have a slow parametric variation
in the direction transversal to this family of lines. Taking into account the
expression of g2 and that α and β has variation mainly along the radial
direction, we can reformulate the restriction by requiring that g2 has no
variation along lines quasi-parallel to the poloidal dierction, and can only
have a weak dependence perpendicular on these lines. This explains our
choice of combination of a and b in the numerical study presented above.

We will make a scaling transformation to reduce the Weierstrass function
to constant coeﬃcient g2. For this we recall the formula for homogeneity of
the Weierstrass function

The code [20] solves the balance equations for energy, density and ﬁelds. The
variables are: the electron and ion temperatures Te, Ti; the current density
j, the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld Bθ, the toroidal electric ﬁeld Eϕ, the electron
density ne, the radial pinch particle velocity Vr. The following equations
are discretized on a one-dimensional space mesh (on the small radius) and
evloved in time by a semi-implicit scheme.

Neutral atoms as well as impurities (Carbon, Oxygen, Iron, Wolfram, Molib-
den) are considered. The transport coeﬃcients are those of the Merejkhin-
Mukhovatov model and the speciﬁc parameters of the tokamak correspond
to the Tore-Supra device. The run is extended over 20 seconds and the sta-
tionarity is reached within few seconds. Then we extract radial dependent
plasma parameter from a time slice at about 13.5 seconds.

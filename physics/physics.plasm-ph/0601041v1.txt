Abstract.
In this work we calculate the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-
helium plasmas with diﬀerent mass fractions of helium by the direct path integral
Monte Carlo method. To avoid unphysical approximations we use the path integral
representation of the density matrix. We pay special attention to the region of weak
coupling and degeneracy and compare the results of simulation with a model based
on the chemical picture. Further with the help of calculated deuterium isochors we
compute the shock Hugoniot of deuterium. We analyze our results in comparison with
recent experimental and calculated data on the deuterium Hugoniot.

Hydrogen and helium are the most abundant elements in the Universe, therefore
thermodynamic properties of hydrogen and helium plasmas are widely required for
many astrophysical problems [1–4]. In particular, the investigation of the giant planets
Jupiter and Saturn, and to a lesser extent brown dwarfs demands the thermodynamic
information for hydrogen and helium in the approximate range of temperatures
103 < T < 105 K and mass densities 0.01 < ρ < 100 g/cm3. This region is
characterized by coupling eﬀects and chemical reactions caused by partial pressure
dissociation and ionization [5, 6]; these eﬀects considerably complicate an equation
of state (EOS) calculation. Moreover, in the same range of parameters the so-called
plasma phase transition (PPT) has been predicted by many authors [1, 5–8]. However
the application of the chemical picture [5, 6] at densities corresponding to pressure
ionization is questionable. Therefore there is a great interest in direct ﬁrst-principle
numerical simulations of strongly coupled degenerate systems which avoid diﬃculties of
conventional theories.

1. Introduction

Calculations of helium and hydrogen-helium plasma thermodynamics

In this work we use the direct path integral Monte Carlo method (DPIMC) to
calculate thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium plasma with diﬀerent mass
fractions of helium. This method is well established theoretically and allows the
treatment of quantum and exchange eﬀects without any approximations using only
fundamental physical constants. We compare the results of our simulation with the
EOS model based on the chemical picture [1, 2]. We also use the DPIMC method
to compute the deuterium Hugoniot. We compare our simulation results with recent
experimental and theoretical works and analyze the modern state of the problem.

2. Simulation method and results for hydrogen-helium plasma

The details of our computational scheme can be found elsewhere [9–12]. Modern
supercomputers allow us to simulate about 100 quantum particles in a Monte Carlo
cell at a given temperature and volume. The DPIMC has no limitations on coupling
parameter and can be applied at signiﬁcant degeneracy of the system (with degeneracy
parameter values as high as 300) [10]. Earlier the method was thoroughly tested by
simulating diﬀerent properties of ideal and interacting degenerate plasmas [13, 14]. In
particular, we investigated temperature and pressure dissociation and ionization ab
initio; we also observed the eﬀect of proton ordering at very high densities and the
formation of a Coulomb crystal of protons [13].

In this section we calculate thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures
at relatively low coupling and degeneracy parameters and compare our results with
a well-known chemical picture model used mostly in astrophysics [1, 2]. This model
includes classical statistics for molecules and ions and Fermi-Dirac statistics for the
It takes into account many physical eﬀects including a number of subtle
electrons.
”second-order” phenomena. We calculated thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-
helium mixtures with a composition corresponding to that of the outer layers of the
Jovian atmosphere. During the mission of the Galileo spacecraft the helium abundance
in the atmosphere of Jupiter was determined as Y = mHe/(mHe + mH) = 0.234 and was
close to the present-day protosolar value Y = 0.275 [3]. As the model of the Jupiter is
signiﬁcantly determined by its composition and EOS, it was interesting to simulate the
thermodynamic properties of the mixture with diﬀerent compositions in the region of
pressure dissociation and ionization.

We considered two mixtures with low and high abundance of helium. The results of
calculations for the mixture corresponding to the outer layers of the Jovian atmosphere
(Y = 0.234) in the region of temperatures from T = 104 to 2·105 K and electron number
densities from ne = 1020 to 3·1024 cm−3 are presented in ﬁgure 1. The agreement between
our calculations and the model [2] along the isotherms T = 4·104, 5·104, 105, and 2·105 K
is quite good and becomes better with the increase of temperature. The formation of
atoms and molecules is the reason of the pressure and energy reduction along the 105 K
isotherm with respect to the isotherm of a non-interacting hydrogen-helium mixture
(see ﬁgure 1).

Figure 2. Pressure (a) and energy per particle (b) in a hydrogen-helium mixture
with the mass concentration of helium Y = 0.988. Shown are DPIMC isotherms and
related EOS isotherms [2]. EOS [2] (DPIMC) calculations: 1(5) — 100 kK, 2(6) —
156 kK, 3(7) — 200 kK, 4(8) — 312 kK. 9 — 100 kK isotherm for ideal plasma. C2 —
critical point of the PPT [8] (Tcr ≈ 120 kK).

The results for Y = 0.988 (almost pure helium) at relatively high temperatures
T = 105 ÷ 3 · 105 K in a wide range of densities are presented in ﬁgure 2. The agreement
between our calculations and the model [2] along the isotherms T = 105, 1.56·105, 2·105,
and 3.12 · 105 K is satisfactory for pressure and internal energy per particle. The smaller
values of pressure on the DPIMC isotherms 105 and 1.56 · 105 K near the particle density
1024 cm−3 can be explained by a strong inﬂuence of interaction and bound states in this
region (see below). Ionization eﬀects also reduce the internal energy of the system in
comparison with non-interacting (ideal) plasma as it can be clearly seen in Fig. 2b. The
positions of ionization minima are well reproduced by the DPIMC method in a good
agreement with the chemical picture calculations. At higher densities Fermi-repulsion
gives the main contribution to pressure and energy and this eﬀect is also observed in
our simulations.

At low temperatures T < 3 · 104 K and Y = 0.234 the agreement between

DPIMC and chemical picture calculations becomes worse, moreover, the region of
thermodynamic instability has been discovered.
In particular, along the isotherm
T = 2 · 104 K we have found such a region in the range of densities between 0.5 and
5 g/cm3. Along the isotherms T = 1.5·104 K and T = 104 K this region is even wider and
begins from 0.38 g/cm3 [12]. Surprisingly, the region of DPIMC instability correlates
with the range of temperatures (T < 2 · 104 K) and densities (0.3–1 g/cm3) in which
the PPT in hydrogen or hydrogen-helium mixture with low mass concentration has
been predicted [1,8,15]. Moreover, the sharp rise of electrical conductivity of hydrogen-
helium mixture along the quasi-isentrope is also revealed experimentally in the range
of densities 0.5-0.83 g/cm3 [16]. However, we cannot claim that these facts conﬁrm the
existence of PPT in our DPIMC simulation; in the nearest future we plan to investigate
the PPT problem in detail using more sophisticated numerical methods.

Because of the high binding energy of electrons in He we currently can obtain
reliable results for Y = 0.988 only at temperatures higher than 105 K. Under these
conditions the inﬂuence of helium double ionization can lead to the formation of bound
states in the Monte Carlo cell as well as pressure and internal energy decrease. Probably
this eﬀect takes place in Fig. 2 near electron number density ne = 1024 cm−3 at T = 105
and 1.56 · 105 K; the critical point of the possible PPT in this region with critical
temperature ≈ 120 kK [8] is also shown in ﬁgure 2a.

3. Deuterium shock Hugoniot

simulation results

Using our previous
for deuterium we calculated the shock
Hugoniot of liquid deuterium [17]. Figure 3 summarizes the data from diﬀerent
experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies on the shock compression of deuterium.
Measurements performed in the NOVA facility, where a shock wave in liquid deuterium
with initial density 0.171 g/cm3 was generated by a laser pulse [18, 19] show that the
deuterium density behind the shock front can increase by a factor of more than 6.
Experiments with the acceleration of an aluminum foil by a magnetic ﬁeld to velocities
higher than 20 km/s [20] show a considerably lower compression ratio in comparison
to [18, 19]. The results obtained in [18, 19] and [20] disagree within experimental errors.
In contrast to [18, 19] and [20], where targets several hundred microns thick were
used, in [21–24], the shock compressibility of solid (initial density 0.199 g/cm3) [21–23]
and liquid [23] deuterium was measured in a 4-mm-thick layer using a hemispherical
explosive device.
It is interesting to note that ﬁrst such measurements for solid
deuterium [21, 23] (points 4) showed greater compressibility of deuterium than it was
reported later [24] (points 5 in ﬁgure 3). The same situation is observed for the
experimental points on liquid deuterium (points 6 and 7, correspondingly, see [25] where
preliminary experimental data for liquid deuterium from [24] are shown). Experimental
points for liquid deuterium [24] are in a good correspondence with the data [20]. Another
hemispherical device was applied for shock loading of dense gaseous deuterium with
initial density close to that of liquid deuterium [25]. In these experiments [25] apart from

kinematic shock wave parameters temperature and light absorption of shock-compressed
gas were registered. Two experimental points 8 corresponding to the initial gas densities
0.1335 g/cm3 and 0.153 g/cm3 are also shown in ﬁgure 3. Curve 15 demonstrates
the SAHA-IV liquid deuterium Hugoniot with the initial density 0.171 g/cm3 [25].
The SAHA-IV chemical plasma model was calibrated so as to be in agreement with
points 8. In this case curve 15 passes through the old position of the liquid Hugoniot
point at 1.09 Mbar [25]. The new position of the point at 1.09 Mbar [24], however, is
shifted towards lower densities. Therefore points 7 and 8 in ﬁgure 3 probably cannot be
described by one and the same theoretical model.

In ﬁgure 3 a number of calculated shock Hugoniots is also shown; the detailed
analysis of these results can be found in our recent works [17, 34]. Here we can only
indicate that the DPIMC Hugoniot is shifted towards higher densities in comparison
to the experimental data published in [20, 24]. At pressures below 1-2 Mbar, the
thermodynamic instability revealed in [35] comes into play; therefore, a segment of
the shock Hugoniot that lies below 1 Mbar is not quite reliable. At higher pressures the
closest to the DPIMC Hugoniot is curve 16 calculated in [33] by the classical reactive
ensemble Monte Carlo method. In this method, the eﬀects of dissociation of deuterium
molecules are taken into account most correctly; this allows one to achieve good

agreement with the experimental data obtained at low temperatures and pressures [26],
even if ionization is not taken into account. Therefore we combined the low-pressure
part of the Hugoniot from [33] and high-pressure one from [17] at 15000 K and obtained
the united Hugoniot [34] (curve 17 in ﬁgure 3). We want to stress here that these two
methods are completely independent and no interpolation procedure is used.

Thus we conﬁrm that the experimental points [18, 19] are questionable and the
true position of the liquid deuterium Hugoniot remains unclear. We believe that
future experiments at the hemispherical device [25] for densities of gaseous deuterium
corresponding to the liquid and solid states will give important additional information
about shock compression of liquid and solid deuterium. In the nearest future we plan to
calculate two DPIMC Hugoniots corresponding to the initial gaseous deuterium densities
0.1335 and 0.153 g/cm3 from the experiment [25].

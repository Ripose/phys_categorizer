Abstract

A fast and efﬁcient numerical-analytical approach is proposed for mod-
eling complex behaviour in the BBGKY hierarchy of kinetic equations.
Numerical modeling shows the creation of various internal structures
from localized modes, which are related to the localized or chaotic type
of behaviour and the corresponding patterns (waveletons) formation.

A fast and efﬁcient numerical-analytical approach is proposed for modeling complex behaviour in the BBGKY hierarchy of
kinetic equations. Numerical modeling shows the creation of various internal structures from localized modes, which are
related to the localized or chaotic type of behaviour and the corresponding patterns (waveletons) formation.

We consider the application of a new numerical/analytical technique based on local nonlinear harmonic analysis approach
(multiscale decomposition) for the description of complex (non-equilibrium) behaviour of the classical statistical ensem-
bles, considered in the framework of the general BBGKY hierarchy (kinetics equations). We restrict ourselves to the ratio-
nal/polynomial type of nonlinearities (with respect to the set of all dynamical variables) that allows to use our results from
[1],[2], which are based on the so called multiresolution framework [3] and the variational formulation of initial nonlinear
(pseudodifferential) problems. Our main goals are an attempt of classiﬁcation and construction of a possible zoo of nontrivial
(meta) stable states: high-localized (nonlinear) eigenmodes, complex (chaotic-like or entangled) patterns, localized (stable)
patterns (waveletons). The last case is a good image for plasma modeling in fusion state (energy conﬁnement). It should be
noted that the class of smoothness (related at least to the appearance of chaotic/fractal-like type of behaviour) of the proper
functional space under consideration plays a key role in the following [2]. Let M be the phase space of an ensemble of N

tions can be applied to the following general Hamiltonians: HN =
potentials Ui(q) = Ui(q1, . . . , qN ) and Uij(qi, qj) are restricted to rational functions of the coordinates. Let Ls and Lij be
the Liouvillean operators (vector ﬁelds) and FN (x1, . . . , xN ; t) be the hierarchy of N -particle distribution function, satisfying
the standard BBGKY–hierarchy (V is the volume):

Our key point in the following consideration is the proper nonperturbative generalization of the perturbative multiscale ap-
proach of Bogolyubov. The inﬁnite hierarchy of distribution functions satisfying system (1) in the thermodynamical limit
is: F = {F0, F1(x1; t), . . . , FN (x1, . . . , xN ; t), . . . }, where Fp(x1, . . . , xp; t) ∈ H p, H 0 = R, H p = L2(R6p) (or any
different proper functional space), F ∈ H ∞ = H 0 ⊕ H 1 ⊕ · · ·⊕ H p ⊕ . . . with the natural Fock space like norm (guaranteeing
the positivity of the full measure):

First of all we consider F = F (t) as a function of time only, F ∈ L2(R), via multiresolution decomposition which nat-
urally and efﬁciently introduces the inﬁnite sequence of the underlying hidden scales. Because the afﬁne group of trans-
lations and dilations generates multiresolution approach, this method resembles the action of a microscope. We consider
a multiresolution decomposition of L2(R) [3] (of course, we may consider any different and proper for some particu-
lar case functional space) which is a sequence of increasing closed subspaces Vj ∈ L2(R) (subspaces for modes with
...V−2 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ .... The closed subspace Vj(j ∈ Z) corresponds to the
ﬁxed dilation value):
level j of resolution, or to the scale j and satisﬁes the following properties:
let Wj be the orthonormal complement of
Vj with respect to Vj+1: Vj+1 = Vj
−∞<j<∞ Wj =

Wj. Then we have the following decomposition: {F (t)} =

Wj in case when Vc is the coarsest scale of resolution. The subgroup of translations generates a basis for the

Mj=0

ﬁxed scale number: spank∈Z {2j/2Ψ(2jt − k)} = Wj. The whole basis is generated by action of the full afﬁne group:
spank∈Z,j∈Z {2j/2Ψ(2jt − k)} = spank,j∈Z {Ψj,k} = {F (t)}.
In multidimensional case we may consider polynomial
in n = 2 case we may use the rectangle lattice of scales and one-dimensional wavelet decomposition:
tensor bases, e.g.

for the following formal representation of the BBGKY system (1) (or its ﬁnite-dimensional nonlinear approximation for the
n-particle distribution functions) with the corresponding obvious constraints on the distribution functions. Let L be an arbi-

we have exactly dN n algebraical equations for dN n unknowns ai0,i1,.... This variational approach reduces the initial problem
to the problem of solution of functional equations at the ﬁrst stage and some algebraical problems at the second. The solution
is parametrized by the solutions of two sets of reduced algebraical problems, one is linear or nonlinear (depending on the
structure of the operator L) and the rest are linear problems related to the computation of the coefﬁcients of the algebraic
equations. The solution of the equations (1) has the following multiscale decomposition via high-localized eigenmodes

which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying time/space scales. The formulae (3) give the expan-
sion into a slow and fast oscillating parts. So, we may move from the coarse scales of resolution to the ﬁnest ones for obtaining
more detailed information about the dynamical process. In this way one obtains contributions to the full solution from each
scale of resolution or each time/space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode. It should be noted that such representations
give the best possible localization properties in the corresponding (phase)space/time coordinates. Formulae (3) do not use
perturbation techniques or linearization procedures. Numerical calculations are based on compactly supported wavelets and
related wavelet families [3] and on evaluation of the accuracy on the level N of the corresponding cut-off of the full system (1)
regarding norm (2): kF N +1 − F N k ≤ ε. Fig. 1 demonstrates the appearance of localized (meta) stable pattern (waveleton),
which can be considered, e.g., as a model for fusion state in plasma.

On the Inadmissibility of Non-evolutionary
Shocks

(Received 25 July 2013)

In recent years, numerical solutions of the equations of compressible magnetohydrody-
namic ﬂows have been found to contain intermediate shocks for certain kinds of problems.
Since these results would seem to be in conﬂict with the classical theory of magnetohy-
drodynamic shocks, they have stimulated attempts to reexamine various aspects of this
theory, in particular the role of dissipation. In this paper we study the general relation-
ship between the evolutionary conditions for discontinuous solutions of the dissipation-
free system and the existence and uniqueness of steady dissipative shock structures for
systems of quasilinear conservation laws with a concave entropy function. Our results
conﬁrm the classical theory. We also show that the appearance of intermediate shocks
in numerical simulations can be understood in terms of the properties of the equations
of planar magnetohydrodynamics for which some of these shocks turn out to be evolu-
tionary. Finally, we discuss ways in which numerical schemes can be modiﬁed in order
to avoid the appearance of intermediate shocks in simulations with such symmetry.

1. Introduction

It is well known that not all discontinuous solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws are
admissible. Some of these can be excluded on physical grounds. For example, expansion
shocks in gas dynamics must be discarded since they do not satisfy the second law of
thermodynamics. Others can be excluded for purely mathematical reasons such as the
fact that they do not satisfy uniqueness and existence conditions or are structurally
unstable with respect to small perturbations of the initial data. These mathematical
conditions are usually called evolutionary conditions. For example, intermediate shocks
in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) satisfy the second law but are not evolutionary.

This subject was extensively studied between the late 1940’s and early 1960’s (e.g.
Courant & Friedrichs 1948, Lax 1957, Akhiezer et al. 1959, Germain 1960, Gel’fand
1963, Polovin 1961) and a full account can be found in numerous textbooks (e.g. Jeﬀrey
& Taniuti 1964, Cabannes 1970, Somov 1994). Until recently there was general agree-
ment that admissible shocks must both satisfy the evolutionary condition and possess a
steady dissipative shock structure, although the relation between these conditions was
not entirely clear. There the matter rested until time-dependent numerical solutions of
the dissipative MHD equations showed that certain types of intermediate shocks can
arise from smooth initial data (Wu 1987). Shortly thereafter, Brio & Wu (1988) found
intermediate shocks in their numerical solution for a particular MHD Riemann problem.
More recently, intermediate shocks have been also been found in two-dimensional simula-
tions (De Sterck et al. 1998). Furthermore, Chao et al. (1993) have reported a detection

2

of an interplanetary intermediate shock in the Voyager 1 data. All this has caused some
authors to reject the classical theory and to suggest that the evolutionary condition is not
relevant to dissipative MHD (Wu 1987, 1988a,b, 1990; Kennel, Blandford & Wu 1990;
Hada 1994, Myong & Roe 1997a,b) and has led to a reexamination of the whole question
of the existence, or otherwise, of non-classical shocks (see Glimm 1988, Freistuhler &
Liu 1993, Myong & Roe 1997a and references therein). There are, however, others who
argue that there is nothing wrong with the classical theory (e.g. Barmin, Kulikovsky &
Pogorelov 1996; Falle & Komissarov 1997).

The matter clearly needs to be resolved, particularly since the existence, or otherwise
of intermediate shocks is of crucial importance not only for fundamental MHD processes
such as reconnection (Wu 1995), but is also relevant to many other astrophysical applica-
tions. The purpose of this paper is to try and clear the matter up by showing that there
is neither a real conﬂict between the classical shock theory and the results of numeri-
cal calculations nor any incompatibility between ideal and dissipative MHD. In order to
make the discussion complete, we have put together and extended a number of results
from the literature that have tended be ignored or misunderstood.

2. General Theory of Shocks

In this section we give a brief review of the classical theory of discontinuous solutions
of hyperbolic conservation laws. For our purposes it is suﬃcient to consider only the
dimensional equations of the form

As is well known, the system (2.1) is called hyperbolic if the Jacobian matrix

has n real eigenvalues, λk (k = 1 . . . n) corresponding to n linearly independent right
eigenvectors, rk and is called strictly hyperbolic if all the λk are diﬀerent. The physical
signiﬁcance of the λk is that they are the speeds of small amplitude waves.
Waves are classiﬁed as linear or nonlinear according to the behaviour of

Ck(u)

rk(u)

≡

· ∇uλk(u).

If Ck(u) = 0 for all u, then the k-wave is called linear, whereas if the dimension of
the surface deﬁned by Ck(u) = 0 is less then n, then it is called nonlinear or genuinely
nonlinear.

The number ns of independent shock equations can be less then n. For example, a contact
discontinuity in gas dynamics has ns = 3 whereas n = 5. Since A is the Jacobian, we
ur, which means that one can associate each
clearly have s
discontinuity that allows this limit with one of the waves of the system. A discontinuity is
called linear if the corresponding characteristic speed does not change across it, otherwise
it is called nonlinear. There mere fact that a discontinuity satisﬁes (2.2) it does not
necessarily imply that it is either stable or that it can arise from continuous initial data.
For some hyperbolic systems equations (2.2) allow nonlinear shocks that propagate
with a characteristic speed associated with a nonlinear wave, which means that they can
be attached to such a wave to form compound waves. Systems with such shock solutions
are called non-convex. Compound waves may arise from continuous initial data if the
system allows single simple waves in which Ck(u) changes sign along the phase curve
of a simple wave. This condition is therefore often used as an alternative deﬁnition of
non-convexity. Although these deﬁnitions are equivalent for a single conservation law,
they are not necessarily so for systems.

The evolutionary condition is directly related to the question of existence and unique-
ness of discontinuous solutions. It is well known that for hyperbolic equations there is a
general way of deciding this question, which is to use the compatibility conditions that
must be satisﬁed along the characteristics (Friedrichs 1955). If a characteristic with wave
speed λk enters one side of a discontinuity, then the state on that side must satisfy the
compatibility relation associated with that characteristic,

lk(u)

du = 0,

·

where lk(u) is the left eigenvector of A corresponding to that characteristic. These equa-
tions are independent provided the lk are linearly independent i.e.
for all hyperbolic
systems. If the wave speeds on either side of the discontinuity are such that mi com-
patibility relations have to be satisﬁed, then there are ns + mi equations relating the
2n + 1 unknowns associated with the discontinuity, ul, ur and the shock speed, s. A
discontinuous solution can therefore only exist and be unique if

Obviously, when ns = n, (2.3) reduces to

mi = 2n

ns + 1.

−

mi = n + 1.

(2.3)

(2.4)

−

It is clear from this that if a characteristic is parallel to the shock curve, then it is
counted as incoming since the corresponding compatibility relation must be satisﬁed
(Gelfand 1963).
If mi > 2n

ns + 1 then the system is overdetermined and there is no solution except
for certain special initial conditions. There will therefore always be arbitrarily small
perturbations of this data that will destroy such a discontinuity by splitting it into a
number of waves, just as an arbitrary initial dicontinuity splits in a Riemann problem.
If mi < 2n
ns + 1, then the solution exists, but is not unique and one might hope that
this nonuniqueness can be removed by including dissipative terms. In the following we
will call condition (2.3) the strong evolutionary condition and call the condition

−

mi ≤

2n

−

ns + 1,

4

S.A.E.G. Falle A N D S.S. Komissarov

which allows nonunique solutions a relaxed evolutionary condition.

An equivalent way of obtaining (2.3) is by a linear structural stability analysis of shock
solutions (e.g. Landau & Lifshitz 1959, Jeﬀrey & Taniuti 1964). A discontinuity that
is exposed to a small amplitude incident wave will only survive if it can respond by
changing its speed and emitting small amplitude waves. Each such wave is described
by one parameter and we also have the perturbation in the shock speed, which means
that there are mo + 1 unknowns in this problem, where mo is the number of outgoing
characteristics. Since these are related to the amplitude of the incoming wave by the ns
shock relations, the discontinuity can only have a unique response if

1.

mo = ns −
It is worth pointing out that, contrary to what is claimed in Myong & Roe, 1997a, this
analysis does not assume that the discontinuity is weak. This suggests that non-unique
discontinuous solutions should spontaneously self-destruct by emitting waves even if they
are not perturbed (Anderson 1963). Although the conditions (2.3) and (2.5) appear
to be diﬀerent, the fact that mo + mi = 2n means that they are entirely equivalent
(Gel’fand 1963). Note that, if the system of shock and compatibility equations splits
into independent subsets, then the discontinuity is only evolutionary if each of these
subsets has the same number of equations as variables (Jeﬀrey & Tanuiti 1964).

(2.5)

Finally, as far as the evolutionary conditions are concerned it does not matter whether,
or not, the system (2.1) is strictly hyperbolic and convex since these properties are not
used in the derivation of (2.3,2.5). However, it is only in the case of strictly hyperbolic
systems that these conditions reduce to the Lax conditions (Lax 1957)

λk−1(ul) < s < λk(ul)

λk(ur) < s < λk+1(ur)

,

for a nonlinear discontinuity associated with the kth characteristic (here we have assumed
that λ1 < λ2 < ... < λn).

3. Evolutionary conditions and dissipative shock structure

In order to assess recent claims that nonevolutionary shocks become admissible if dis-
sipative terms are included, we need to look at the general relationship between the
evolutionary conditions and the uniqueness and existence of steady dissipative shock
structures. Godunov (1961) has shown that it is much easier to explore this question if
the equations can be transformed to a symmetric form. Although this is not possible
for arbitrary hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, it can certainly be done for gas-
dynamics, MHD, and the shallow water equations and probably for any system that can
arise in nature.

3.1. Symmetric Form of the Ideal Equations

We start by summarizing some of the results described by Friedrichs (1954), Friedrichs
& Lax (1971) and Boillat (1974, 1982). As before, it is only necessary to consider the
one dimensional case.

Consider a dissipation-free system of conservation laws described by the equations
(2.1). Suppose now that there exists a quantity, h(u), which is also conserved as long as
the solution to this system is continuous. For example, h(u) is the entropy in gasdynamics
or MHD, whereas it is the total energy for the shallow water equations. If such a quantity

5

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

exists, then there must exist a ﬂux function, g(u), such that

(2.1) and (3.1) can only be consistent if

Note that h is usually a strictly concave function, in which case (3.7) ensures that P
is positive deﬁnite and the transformation is non-singular. In ordinary gasdynamics or
MHD, h is the entropy per unit volume and is therefore guaranteed to be concave by the
e, where e is the
second law of thermodynamics. For the shallow water equations h =
sum of the kinetic and potential energy and dissipation ensures that this is also concave.

Since the term on the RHS of this equation represents a source term for h and the second
law of thermodynamic requires that this be positive if h is the entropy per unit volume,
the matrix D must be positive deﬁnite for gasdynamics and MHD. The dissipative shallow
water equations must also satisfy this condition if we set h =
e, where e is the total
energy.

One can also show that all linear waves decay if D is positive deﬁnite and h is a strictly

concave. The linear version of (3.8) is simply

any trajectory that does exist can be destroyed by perturbations of u′

The following theorem relates dim(Lu) and dim(Rs) to the number of characteristics

Theorem 3.1. If u′

e is an equilibrium point of the dissipative shock equations (3.12)

A standard result (e.g. Gantmacher 1959) tells us that, since Pl, Ql are symmetric and
Pl is positive deﬁnite, Ql has the same number of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues
as the set λk. If, like Godunov (1961), we assume that Dl is symmetric as well as positive
deﬁnite, then the theorem would follow immediately from (3.13) and (3.14). However,
the following lemma shows that this is an unnecessary restriction.

Since Dǫ is positive deﬁnite this requires η = 0 and hence µk = 0, which cannot be true
if the eigenvalues of Q are non-zero. This completes the proof of the lemma.

(3.13), (3.14) and lemma (1) show that the theorem is true even if D is not symmetric.

This is a somewhat more direct proof of a result which has also been obtained by
Kulikovsky & Lyubimov (1965). In their analysis of viscous shock structures, Myong &
Roe (1997a) assumed that Theorem 3.1 holds for MHD, but did not give a proof.

This analysis tells us that if the shock relations (3.11) have a solution such that none
of the characteristic speeds given by (3.14) vanish in both the left and the right state
and mi is the number of characteristics entering the shock, then

(a) for mi = n+1 the shock can have a unique structurally stable dissipative structure;
(b) for mi > n + 1 the dissipative structure is not guaranteed to be unique.
(c) for mi < n + 1 there might be a unique dissipative structure but it cannot be

structurally stable.

These conditions are not only compatible with the evolutionary conditions, they are
complementary to them. Shocks for which mi > n + 1 have a dissipative shock structure
and could therefore be regarded as admissible on these grounds. However, the left and
right states of such shocks must be carefully tuned since they cannot adjust themselves
to an arbitrary small perturbation of their left and right states. Shocks that satisfy the
relaxed evolutionary condition, mi < n + 1, are apparently permitted by the ideal equa-
tions, but cannot establish a dissipative structure and must spontaneously self-destruct.
It is therefore clear that the only physically admissible shocks are those those that satisfy
the strong evolutionary conditions (2.3) or (2.4).

Theorem 3.1 gives us no information in those cases for which the shock speed coincides
with at least one of the characteristic speeds. The corresponding critical point is then
no longer hyperbolic and its type depends on the details of the particular system.

4. Application to Magnetohydrodynamics

As we shall see, the mathematical properties of the full system of MHD and the reduced
planar system of MHD are somewhat diﬀerent and this has to be clearly understood when
the evolutionary conditions are applied. We therefore discuss these systems separately.

As we have already discussed, ideal MHD has a supplementary conservation law repre-
senting the conservation of thermodynamic entropy. The second law of thermodynamics
guarantees that the function h = ρS, where S is the entropy per unit mass, is strictly
concave (e.g. TerHaar & Wergeland 1966) and hence that the matrix P deﬁned by (3.7)
is positive deﬁnite. The system of MHD equations can therefore be written in the sym-
metric form (3.6) and is hyperbolic. Although this has been demonstrated for relativistic
MHD by Ruggeri & Strumia (1981), we have been unable to ﬁnd an account of the cor-
responding analysis for classical MHD in the literature. However, since the derivations
are similar to those for the relativistic case, we shall simply give the symmetric variables.

There is no need to verify that the matrix, D, of dissipation coeﬃcients is positive
deﬁnite, since this must be true for any system that obeys the second law of thermo-
dynamics. Indeed, this condition is used to derive the dissipative equations in the ﬁrst
place (e.g. Landau & Lifshitz 1960). The exact form of symmetrized equations is also of
no importance for our purposes. Their existence, does, however, allow us to apply the
conclusions of the general theory described in Sections 2 and 3 to dissipative MHD.

4.1.2. Shock Types

The MHD shock equations allow two linear solutions and several distinct types of
nonlinear solutions which satisfy the entropy principle that the entropy of a ﬂuid element
always increases. A convenient way of classifying these is to use the jump in the transverse
component of magnetic ﬁeld, Bt. From the shock equations one ﬁnds (Jeﬀrey & Taniuti
1964)

where vx is the velocity in the shock frame. Note that if c2
x does not vanish, then
Bt on one side of the discontinuity must be either parallel or anti-parallel to that on the
other.

The nonlinear solutions are
(a) Slow/Fast shocks, which have non-zero Bt in the same direction on both sides.
(4.1) then implies that there is no change in sign of (c2

ﬁeld is larger on the downstream side for fast shocks and smaller downstream for slow
shocks.

The linear discontinuities are
(a) Alfv´en discontinuities, which have v2

a on both sides. case (4.1) then allows
an arbitrary change in the direction of Bt. However, the magnitude of Bt remains
unchanged, which is why these are sometimes called rotational discontinuities.

(4.1) then implies that

x = c2

(b) Contact discontinuities, which have the same value of vx on both sides, but v2

= c2
a.
(4.1) then requires that Bt be continuous unless Bx = 0 and the other shock conditions
require all other variables, except for the density, to be continuous.

We shall also ﬁnd occasion to use the following classiﬁcation of nonlinear MHD shocks,
which is due to Germain (1960). The states in the shock frame are divided into four types

1)

and a shock is deﬁned to be of type m
n if the upstream and downstream states are
of types m and n respectively. From the MHD shock equations, one ﬁnds that pressure
and speciﬁc volume, τ (τ = 1/ρ), on each side of a nonlinear shock satisfy the following
equations

4.1.3. Evolutionary conditions

When we apply the evolutionary conditions to MHD discontinuities we have to take
into account the fact that the system of shock and compatibility equations split into two
independent subsets for all types of discontinuities, except the alfv´en discontinuity,. If
we choose a reference frame such that on one side of a discontinuity Bz = 0 and vz = 0
then the system of shock equations contains two equations involving Bz and vz. These
are

Bz l = Bz r,

vz l = vz r.
The compatibility relations along the alfv´en characteristics only involve Bz and vz and
they also the only ones that do so. An evolutionary discontinuity that is not an alfv´en
discontinuity must therefore not only satisfy the general condition (2.3), but also have
exactly two incoming, and hence two outgoing alfv´en characteristics. These conditions
also follow from the linear stability analysis (Syrovatskii 1959, Jeﬀrey & Tanuiti 1964).
In the rest of this section we simply state the well known results on the evolutionary
properties of MHD discontinuities. We do, however, pay particular attention to those
cases in which there are characteristics travelling with the same speed as the discontinuity.
As we have pointed out in Section 2, such characteristics must be counted as incoming.
There is no dispute about the fact that fast and slow shocks are evolutionary because
they have eight incoming characteristics, two of which are alfv´en waves. Furthermore,
since their speed can never be equal to a characteristic speed, Theorem 3.1 tells us that
they also have a unique structurally stable dissipative structure.

All intermediate shocks are super-alfv´enic with respect to the upstream state and sub-
alfv´enic with respect to the downstream state, which means that they have too many

12

S.A.E.G. Falle A N D S.S. Komissarov

(> 2) incoming alfv´en characteristics. They are therefore nonevolutionary and can be
destroyed by interactions alfv´en waves.

The same argument applies to switch-on and switch-oﬀ shocks which also have too
many (9) incoming characteristics, 3 of which are alfv´en characteristics. However, these
solutions are clearly limits of fast and slow shocks and therefore have evolutionary solu-
tions in their immediate neighbourhood, which is why Jeﬀrey & Taniuti (1964) call them
weakly evolutionary. That they are not strictly evolutionary can also be understood from
the following example. Consider a switch-on shock overtaking weak switch-oﬀ fast rar-
efaction travelling in the same direction. Once these have merged, the shock is no longer
propagating into a state with zero transverse magnetic ﬁeld. Since the shock is superfast,
it has no way of modifying its upstream state and therefore cannot remain a switch-on
shock. Instead, such an interaction leads to the appearance of a neighbouring fast shock
solution, together with some other waves, at least one of which must, in general, be an
alfv´en wave.

If we count the two entropy characteristics as incoming on the grounds that they have
the same speed as the discontinuity, then contact discontinuities have eight incoming
characteristics, two of which are alfv´en characteristics. They are therefore evolutionary.
Alfv´en discontinuities also have eight incoming characteristics if we include the two
alfv´en characteristics that have the same speed as the discontinuity. The total number
of incoming alfv´en characteristics is three, but this is allowed since the fact that the
shock equations for these discontinuities couple the y and z components of velocity and
magnetic ﬁeld means that this is the one case for which the shock equations do not
decompose into two sets.

Theorem 3.1 cannot be applied to contact and alfv´en discontinuities since they prop-
agate with a characteristic speed. However, they would in any case not possess a steady
dissipative structure simply because they are linear and therefore have no nonlinear
steepening to balance the spreading due to dissipation. For this reason, Wu (1988b)
considers them to be inadmissible, but since their width grows like t1/2, whereas the
separation between the waves in a Riemann problem grows like t, they must be regarded
as admissible components of the solution for large times.

4.2. Reduced system of planar MHD

In this section we discuss the system of equations which describes MHD in a world in
which the plane deﬁned by the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld is invariant. There are
several reasons for doing this. Firstly, it has some interesting properties. Secondly, we
want to show that the general classical theory of shocks is as valid for this system as it
is for the full system. Finally, the numerical simulations that gave rise to the current
conroversy surrounding intermediate shocks reﬂect the properties of this system.

When the z components of the magnetic ﬁeld and velocity vanish, the equations reduce

to a system of 5 variables with the following vectors of conserved quantities and ﬂuxes

This is still a hyperbolic system but it is fundamentally diﬀerent from the full system
of MHD because it does not have alfv´en waves. However, the other characteristic ﬁelds
are still present with the same eigenvalues and with eigenvectors that are the same
apart from the reduced number of components. Moreover, it has the same solutions of

Intermediate Shocks

13

the shock equations including the alfv´en discontinuity, except that these are now only
allowed to change the direction of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld by π. This follows from
the remarkable property of the full system of MHD that there exists an inertial frame
in which the variation of the transverse components of the magnetic ﬁeld and velocity
induced by all characteristic waves and shocks, except for alfv´en waves, are conﬁned to
single plane. Note that the alfv´en discontinuity still propagates with the alfve´n speed,
but this is no longer on of the characteristic speeds. The Riemann problem for this
system has been analysed in considerable detail by Myong & Roe (1997b) who came to
the conclusion that the classical evolutionary conditions are inadequate for this system.
However, we intend to show that this claim is based on a failure to recognise the essential
diﬀerence between the reduced system and full MHD.

4.2.1. Evolutionary conditions

Since the number of equation is reduced by two and it is the alfv´en waves that are
lost, we can conclude that all evolutionary discontinuities that have two incoming alfv´en
characteristics in the full system remain evolutionary in the planar system. This implies
that fast, slow and contact discontinuities are evolutionary.

On the other hand, discontinuities that are evolutionary in the full system, but which
do not have exactly two incoming alfv´en characteristics must be non-evolutionary in the
planar system. There is only one such discontinuity, the alfv´en discontinuity, which now
only has 5 incoming characteristics and should therefore spontaneously self-destruct even
if it is not perturbed.

Another interesting feature is that some of the shocks that are non-evolutionary in the
full system become evolutionary in the reduced system. 1
3 shocks now satisfy the
strong evolutionary condition, in fact they have the same incoming and outgoing char-
acteristics as fast and switch-on shocks. As far as the characteristic count is concerned
these three shocks are therefore indistinguishable so that one can use a single name,
plane fast shock, say, for all of them. Similarly, 2
4 shocks, switch-oﬀ shocks and slow
shocks become slightly diﬀerent versions of evolutionary plane slow shocks.

→

→

→

However, 1

4 shocks remain non-evolutionary even in the plane system since they
have 7 incoming characteristics. Such shocks, which have too many incoming charac-
teristics, are often called overcompressive in the literature. As we have shown, although
they do have a steady dissipative structure, it is not unique and it does not help them
to survive interactions with external perturbations.

2

→

3 shocks have only 5 incoming characteristics and are therefore non-evolutionary.
Such shocks, which have too few incoming characteristics, are often called undercom-
pressive. Since they do not have a structurally stable steady dissipative structure they
should disintegrate spontaneously even without any external perturbation.

Now consider shocks that propagate at one of the characteristic speeds in either the up-
s shocks are non-evolutionary since
4, and f
stream or downstream state. 1
they have 7 incoming characteristics. On the other hand, 2
3 shocks have
6 incoming characteristics and are therefore evolutionary. The planar system of MHD
is therefore genuinely non-convex and admits the two evolutionary compound waves: a
slow compound wave consisting of a 2
s shock with an attached slow rarefaction and
a fast compound wave consisting of a fast rarefaction with an attached f

3 shock.

Myong & Roe (1997b) found that some Riemann problems only have a solution if non-
evolutionary shocks are permitted. However, as we discuss in
6, these Riemann problems
are conﬁned to regions of parameter space with zero volume, which is exactly what is
meant by the statement that non-evolutionary shocks are structurally unstable.

§

In the next section we show that the results of numerical calculations are entirely

consistent with these conclusions.

5. Numerical Calculations

The numerical calculations were carried out using the scheme described in Falle, Komis-
sarov & Joarder (1998). This is an upwind shock capturing scheme which is capable of
dealing with shocks of arbitrary strength even without the inclusion of any dissipation
other than that introduced by the truncation errors. Careful test simulations have shown
that this scheme provides accurate solutions for all types of MHD waves in all regimes.
One can argue that if a numerical scheme works well then its numerical dissipation must
have the same qualitative properties as the physical dissipation. However, in order to
remove any doubts, we modiﬁed our scheme so that it can now handle dissipative MHD
and all the calculations described here have a fully resolved dissipative shock structures
(about 15 mesh points wide). For this we used a simple scalar form for the dissipation
for which equations (2.1) become

As expected, the outcomes of all the simulations presented here did not not depend
on the size of dissipation and were the same even when only numerical and/or artiﬁcial
dissipation was present. The only eﬀect of changing the dissipation was to alter the form
and width of the shock structures.

First of all, we need to establish whether the behaviour of numerical MHD shocks

agrees with the predictions of the evolutionary theory. In order to do this, we adopt the
following procedure. First we test whether a shock has a steady dissipative structure
by setting up the relevant Riemann problem and running the calculation until a well
resolved steady dissipative shock structure is established, as expected for evolutionary
and overdetermined shocks, or a completely diﬀerent solution emerges, as expected for
underdetermined shocks. If a steady structure exists, then we test to see whether it can
survive small perturbations. This can be accomplished by considering a slightly diﬀerent
Riemann problem, as in Barmin et al.
(1996) or, like Wu (1988a), allowing a small
amplitude wave to interact with the shock.

We start by discussing the results of the planar simulations. They show that if the initial

surprising because all of them have neighbouring solutions containing shocks with a

4 shocks are overdetermined in full MHD and it is therefore possible
that they might have a nonunique steady dissipative structure, indeed it turns out that
they do. These shocks, as well as 1
4 shocks, can now have a nonvanishing z-component
of magnetic ﬁeld inside the shock layer even if Bz = 0 outside. For given the dissipative
coeﬃcients their stucture can be parameterised by the value of the following integral

We can gradually increase or decrease the value of Iz by sending from the downstream
side of the shock an alfv´en wave that ﬁrst rotates the magnetic ﬁeld by a small angle and
then restores the original state. This wave is absorbed by the shock which develops a
new steady structure (see Figure 5a). However, like Kennel et al. (1990) we found that
there is a maximum value of
that the shock can manage. If this limit is exceeded,
then the shock disintegrates (see Figure b). This does not occur in the case of fast and
slow shocks because the alfv´en waves do not get trapped inside the shocks, but instead
pass straight through.

3 shocks have the right number of incoming characteristics and may therefore
have a unique dissipative structure in full MHD. Since such a structure does not exist
in planar MHD, we can only expect to ﬁnd them in our simulations by allowing a non-
zero Bz. In order to do this, we modiﬁed the initial data by inserting a layer in which
the transverse ﬁeld rotates smoothly from that in the original left state to that in the
original right state. We found that the solution never relaxed to a smooth steady 2

that the solution shown in ﬁgure 5b actually contains a 2

after interaction with a small amplitude alfv´en wave. After the alfv´en wave has been
absorbed the transverse ﬁelds on either side of the shock are no longer parallel or an-
tiparallel as required by the shock equations. The shock can only become coplanar by
emitting alfv´en waves, which, for an intermediate shock, can only be done in the down-
stream direction. However, since there is no downstream travelling alfv´en wave that can
restore the original post-shock state, the shock must split. This argument is not new, in
fact it was used by Kantrowitz & Petschek (1966) to prove that intermediate shocks are
unphysical. The wave designated as AW in ﬁgure 7 can be called a dissipative alfv´en wave
but it could also be described as an evolving 2
3 shock with a gradually increasing
value of Iz.

6. Discussion

The results described in the previous sections have clariﬁed many aspects of the shock
theory in general and MHD shocks in particular and provide a basis upon which we can
discuss other important, related, issues.

6.1. Riemann problems and evolutionary conditions

One of the arguments in favour of non-evolutionary shocks used in current literature is
that some Riemann problems do not have a solution unless non-evolutionary shocks are
admitted (e.g. Glimm 1988, Myong & Roe 1997a,b). This is presumably based on the
belief that any Riemann problem must have a physically admissible solution. Although
this is certainly true for gas dynamics, there is surely no reason why this has to hold
for any system. It all comes down to the notions of bifurcations and structural stability.
One has to ask the following question: is it, or is it not, possible to carry out the relevant
experiment in a laboratory? If the qualitative result of the experiment does not change
when the initial conditions are slightly changed, then the problem is structurally stable
and the experiment is possible, at least in principle. However, if this is not true, then the
problem is structurally unstable and no appropriate experiment is possible. It therefore
follows that the set of structurally unstable Riemann problem are conﬁned to regions of

Figure 6. Dissipative structure of a 2 → 3 shock in full MHD. This shock has a unique steady
dissipative structure and therefore reacts to a change in Iz by emitting some waves and turning

dashed lines for Iz = −0.52.

parameter space whose total volume is zero. Now suppose there is an MHD Riemann
problem that has no other solutions than those containing non-evolutionary shocks. Since
there are arbitrary small perturbations of the parameters that cause these shocks to split
into evolutionary shocks, this Riemann problem must be structurally unstable. In full
MHD the only known case for which a non-evolutionary shock, a 1
4 shock, is required
is a piston problem in which the piston velocity is parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld (Jeﬀrey
& Taniuti 1964). If this condition is not exactly satisﬁed then the non-evolutionary shock
does not arise. Close inspection of the solution of the Riemann problem for planar MHD
presented by Myong & Roe (1997b) shows that non-evolutionary shocks are required only
on the boundaries between domains in parameter space that contain only evolutionary
shocks.

→

6.2. Steepening of continuous waves

Another argument that appears to justify the existence of intermediate shocks is based
on the results of numerical simulations by Wu (1987), which suggest that intermediate
shocks can be formed by nonlinear steepening of simple magnetosonic waves. Since the
transverse component of magnetic ﬁeld changes sign across an intermediate shock the
simple wave must have the same property, which means that the transverse component
of magnetic ﬁeld must vanish somewhere within the wave. However, at this point the
magnetosonic speed is equal to the alfv´en speed and it is impossible to assign a unique
eigenvector to the simple wave. As the result, the direction of the tangential component of
the ﬁeld can rotate by an arbitrary angle at this point so that simple wave really consists
of two distinct parts, which are disconnected as far as the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
is concerned. This can be put in a slightly diﬀerent way. Alfv´en waves propagating in the
same direction as such a simple wave cannot pass throught the alfv´en point. During the
steepening they will accumulate near this point giving rise to a net ﬁeld rotation so that
the discontinuity that forms has non-coplanar left and right states and can therefore not
be a single shock. Instead, it must split into evolutionary shocks, one of which must be
an alfv´en shock. Incidentally, this seems to be the only way of generating alfv´en shocks.
However, in planar MHD the transition through the alfv´enic point is unique and as

we have seen some of the intermediate shocks are in fact evolutionary. This is the
explanation for the outcome of the planar simulations performed by Wu (1987). He also
found that the results were not very diﬀerent if the initial data was perturbed so that it
was no longer exactly coplanar. However, because of the periodic boundary conditions
used in this simulation, there was no net rotation in the perturbed problem, which makes
it rather artiﬁcial. The reason why this perturbation did not destroy the intermediate
shock is that these boundary conditions, together with the initial data, only allowed a

small value of Iz per shock. It is therefore hardly surprising that an intermediate shock
appeared since, as we have shown, these shocks can survive if Iz is small enough.

6.3. Timescale for disintegration

Let us suppose that an intermediate shock has somehow been formed and then interacts
with an alfv´en wave that rotates the magnetic ﬁeld by a small angle δφ. It is clearly
of some importance to know how long it takes for the shock to split. Our simulations
show that it splits when the the value of Iz associated with the shock structure becomes
comparable with lBy, where l is the shock thickness. If the incident alfv´en wave has a
small amplitude, δφ, then this gives us the following estimate for the disintegration time,

where we have used the alfv´en speed as a characteristic ﬂuid velocity in the shock frame.
This also tells us that the shock will only propagate for a distance
l/δφ before it falls
apart. From this we conclude that in all cases for which the dissipative scale is much
smaller then the characteristic length scale of the ﬂow, intermediate shocks can only
appear as very short lived time-dependent phenomena.

Exactly the same arguments can be applied to the magnetohydrodynamic shocks in
the interstellar medium. Not only does the theory of collisionless shocks (see e.g. Tidman
& Krall 1971) predict that, in these conditions, such shocks are extremely thin compared
to the scale of the ﬂow but there are numerous observations that conﬁrm that this is
indeed true (see e.g. Draine & McKee 1993).

6.4. Convexity of MHD

From the above discussion it is quite clear that a hyperbolic system is genuinely non-
convex if it allows structurally stable compound waves that only contain evolutionary
shocks. Planar MHD is therefore genuinely non-convex whereas full MHD is convex.

6.5. Non-evolutionary shocks in numerical simulations

The appearance of non-evolutionary shocks in numerical calculations is not something
that is unique to MHD since it is well known that, even in gas dynamics, some numerical
schemes can generate expansion shocks in certain circumstances. However, this phe-
nomenon is both more subtle and more interesting in the case of MHD. The essential
point is that, unlike gas dynamics, planar MHD is is very diﬀerent from full MHD in
the sense that there are shocks that are non-evolutionary in full MHD, but evolutionary
in planar MHD and vice-versa. Unfortunately, this property means that the results of
planar MHD simulations can be very misleading because, although most upwind schemes
seem to give perfectly good solutions for planar MHD, these are of no relevance to the
real universe with its three spatial dimensions. This is not at all unusual, indeed it may
very well be the rule rather than the exception. For example, the properties of ﬂuid
turbulence are very diﬀerent in two and three dimensions as are those of magnetohydro-
dynamic dynamos.

The other properties of non-evolutionary MHD shocks, that are not shared by gas dy-
namical expansion shocks, are that all of them satisfy the second law of thermodynamics
and most of them also possess a steady dissipative structure. This, together with the
fact that the ratio of the thickness of numerical shock structures to the overall scale of
the ﬂow is almost always many orders of magnitude greater than in the corresponding
physical system, means that they can persist for a signiﬁcant time even in nonplanar
problems. For example, if the piston problem discussed by Jeﬀrey & Taniuti (1964, p.
256–258) is slightly modiﬁed so that it has a small transverse component of the ﬁeld,
then the evolutionary solution contains fast, slow and alfv´en shocks all propagating with

Intermediate Shocks

very similar speeds. In a numerical simulation this complex would remain unresolved for
some time, during which it would be classiﬁed as a 1

4 shock.

The only truly satisfactory solution to this diﬃculty is to devise schemes that only
allow evolutionary shocks. Figure 8 shows that there are schemes that will do this.
Here we have a numerical solution to the Brio & Wu problem obtained with our MHD
version of Glimm’s scheme (Glimm 1965). This method requires a nonlinear Riemann
solver and we employ the one described in Falle et al. (1998), which speciﬁcally excludes
intermediate shocks.
In fact we do not use Glimm’s scheme everywhere, but only to
track the alfv´en shock. One can see that in this way we can avoid the appearance of
intermediate shocks even in planar problems. Unfortunately, it is not a simple matter to
generalise this to more than one dimension.

The only viable option, that we can think of, is to subject all numerical calculations
to a careful analysis using the theory described in this paper. As an example of this, it
is instructive look at some recent calculations of steady MHD ﬂow past a cylinder.

Recently, De Sterck et al.(1998) have carried out numerical MHD calculations of the ﬂow
past an inﬁnite, perfectly conducting cylinder. These are planar simulations and must
therefore be interpreted in the light of the theory of planar MHD. The parameters are
chosen in such way that the usual convex bow shock is impossible. Instead, the analysis
given in Steinolfson & Hundhausen (1990) suggests that the shock has a dimple. They
assumed that there is only a single shock, in which case a cosistent solution requires the
shock type to change from 1
4 as the distance from the

symmetry axis decreases. Although the 1
4 shock is non-evolutionary even in planar
→
MHD, in this case it seems that such a shock must occur on the symmetry axis for the
same reason that it occurs when a piston moves parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. However,
one would expect it to split into 1
4 shocks further
away from the the axis. Indeed, De Sterck et al.(1998) ﬁnd that not far from the axis

the 1
4 shock splits and the leading shock (ED in their notation) is a 1

distance from this branching point the other shock (EG) is identiﬁed by them as f
but this is unlikely to be true everywhere for such an inhomogeneous ﬂow. One would also
expect another branching at the point where Steinolfson & Hundhausen (1990) predict
4. The results of De Sterck et al.(1998) do, indeed, show
a transition from 1

this branching (DE and DG), with the trailing shock being clearly identiﬁable as a 2

7. Conclusions

Both our analysis and numerical results show that the evolutionary conditions for
existence and uniqueness of discontinuous solutions of the equations of ideal MHD are
not only compatible with the conditions for existence and uniqueness of steady dissipative
shock structures, they are actually complementary to them. The general theory suggests
that this will be true for all nonlinear hyperbolic systems that can arise in nature. Non-
evolutionary shock can have a nonunique dissipative structure and may, perhaps, appear
under some exeptional curcumstances as transient phenomena. However, they are not
persistent and are bound to split when subjected to small perturbations. In the case of
MHD, alfv´en waves are the most eﬀective killers since not only our calculations but also
those described by Wu (1988a) show that intermediate MHD shocks are destroyed by
interactions with alfv´en waves. It is true that it takes a ﬁnite time for this interaction

26

S.A.E.G. Falle A N D S.S. Komissarov

to take place, but in any physical system that we know of, this time is so short that it is
most unlikely that such shocks can be detected.

The occurrence of intermediate MHD shocks in planar numerical simulations is con-
sistent with the mathematical properties of planar MHD, in which 1
4
shocks become evolutionary but the alfv´en shock becomes non-evolutionary. However,
the planar limit is a singular limit of full MHD and we suggest that planar numerical
simulations should be avoided, especially since they are hardly any cheaper than for full
MHD.

→

→

Intermediate shocks may even pollute full MHD simulations because numerical shock
structures are usually not very thin compared to the length scale of the ﬂow.
It is
therefore essential that the results of such simulations be subjected to a careful analysis
in order to make sure that they do not contain any intermediate shocks. If they do, then
additional work is required to determine the extent to which they are corrupted. The
results of our calculations with Glimm’s scheme show that this problem can be eliminated
in numerical schemes that treat shocks especially alfv´en shocks, as discontinuities.

Coherent Acceleration of Magnetized Ions by Electrostatic Waves
with Arbitrary Wavenumbers

We study the coherent acceleration of ions interacting with two electrostatic waves
in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld ~B0. This is a generalization of an earlier analysis of waves
propagating perpendicularly to ~B0 to include the eﬀect of wavenumbers along ~B0.
The Lie transformation technique is used to develop a perturbation theory describing
the ion motion, and results are compared with numerical solutions of the complete
equations of motion. We ﬁnd that coherent energization occurs when the Doppler-
shifted wave frequencies diﬀer by nearly an integer multiple of the ion cyclotron
frequency. When the diﬀerence in the parallel wavenumbers of the two waves is
increased the coherent energization of ions is limited to a small part of the phase
space. The energization of ions and its dependence on wave parameters is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The motion of charged particles in the presence of electromagnetic waves is a rich dynam-
ical system that has been studied for a variety of cases. Important physical applications of
this problem occur in laboratory and space plasmas, such as for high-temperature (collision-
less) plasma heating and current drive and the transverse energization of ions for times short
compared to collisional times. A particular area of interest is the nonlinear heating of ions
(as opposed to linear mechanisms such as Landau and cyclotron damping) by electrostatic
waves propagating through a plasma in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld ~B0.

For a single electrostatic wave propagating across ~B0, the stochastic heating of ions by

= Nωci (ωci ≡
waves with frequency ω
was studied in [1, 2]. It was found that ions with speeds across ~B0 less than the phase velocity
of the wave ω/k⊥ (that is, k⊥ρi & ω/ωci) exhibit regular motion and do not gain energy.
However, for wave amplitudes above a threshold amplitude, the ions are stochastically heated
if their speeds are inside a region with a lower bound near ω/k⊥. The stochastic “webs”
generated by a single perpendicularly propagating wave with frequency ω = Nωci also lead
to stochastic ion heating [3, 4, 5].

For a single wave propagating obliquely to ~B0 it was found [6, 7] that ions could also
be stochastically heated. It has recently been shown that single and multiple drift-Alfv´en
waves with ω < ωci can induce stochastic ion heating [8], which may account for certain

experimental observations [9]. For two waves propagating obliquely to ~B0, the threshold
wave amplitudes needed for stochastic motion can be signiﬁcantly lowered [10]. There is
still a lower bound for the stochastic region of phase space. The stochastic region for two
perpendicularly propagating waves may extend lower in phase space than it does for one
wave for large enough wave amplitudes [11].

For two perpendicular waves that satisfy the resonance condition ω1 −

ω2 = Nωci Ram
et al. discovered numerically [12] that coherent (as opposed to chaotic) energization can
bring ions from low energies into the stochastic domain. B´enisti et al. [13] then showed that
this coherent energization was described by perturbation analysis using Lie transformation
methods. The coherent energization was also shown by Ram et al. [14] to be described by a
multiple time scale analysis, and invoked to explain the energization of hydrogen and oxygen
ions from Earth’s upper auroral ionosphere into the magnetosphere. For two non-collinear,
perpendicularly propagating waves, the coherent energization was found to persist as long
as the angle between them was less than 30◦ [15].

ωpi ≫

In this paper we study the interaction of ions with electrostatic waves ranging in frequency
from lower-hybrid frequencies down to a few multiples of ωci. The analysis of B´enisti et al.
is generalized to include nonzero wavenumbers along ~B0. We develop a perturbation theory
using the Lie transformation method and ﬁnd conditions for which coherent acceleration
persists. We also discuss the dependence of the range of energization and period of coherent
oscillations on wave parameters.

The Hamiltonian formulation of the problem is given in Section II. An analytic perturba-
tion theory for the coherent motion based on the Lie transformation technique is described
in Section III. Section IV compares the results for the perturbation theory with numerical
results obtained from the complete dynamical equations. The scalings of coherent ener-
gization and the period of oscillation, for perpendicularly propagating waves, are obtained.
Section V discusses the case of obliquely propagating waves and compares the results with
those for two perpendicularly propagating waves.

III. PERTURBATION ANALYSIS OF COHERENT MOTION

In general, the equations of motion obtained from (5) cannot be solved analytically.
Consequently, we resort to numerical solutions to provide an insight into the dynamics of
ions in two electrostatic waves. Figure 1 shows the time evolution of ρ for three ions having
the same initial ρ0, but diﬀerent φ0, interacting with two waves of frequencies ν1 = 40.37 and
ν2 = 39.37, and amplitudes ǫ1 = ǫ2 = 4. (All the numerical solutions of ODEs have been
carried out using the Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm described in [17].) There are two distinct
kinds of motion: the slow, smooth, “coherent” oscillations at lower ρ, and the irregular,
“stochastic” motion at higher ρ. Superimposed on the coherent motion are small-amplitude,
high-frequency ﬂuctuations. Figure 2 shows the orbits for the same parameters as Fig. 1

except that ν2 = 39.369 and the initial conditions are diﬀerent. This demonstrates that the
coherent acceleration from low to high energies occurs only when ν1 −
Our interest is to provide an analytical description of the coherent dynamics without
going into details of the stochastic region, other than to note its existence for ρ

[1, 2]. We assume that the waves are perturbing the cyclotron motion of the ions and express

Our perturbation analysis assumes there are no resonances at O(ǫ). Such resonances

occur if νi is an integer, where our present analysis breaks down.

The explicit time dependence in ¯H can be eliminated by transforming from ¯φ to ¯ψ = ¯φ

˜H( ¯ψ, ¯z, ¯I, ¯vz) = 1

where ¯I = ˜I has replaced ˜I ( ¯I and ¯ψ are canonically conjugate). Since ˜H does not depend
explicitly on time it is a constant of the motion.

Using Hamilton’s equations for ˙¯I and ˙¯vz, we ﬁnd a second constant of the motion:

For an initial condition with a given value of ˜H, ¯ρ varies between the two points where ˜H
equals H+(¯ρ) or H−(¯ρ). We refer to H± as the potential barriers, since they delimit the
allowed and forbidden regions of phase space.

Figure 3 shows the orbits generated by the second-order Hamiltonian (17) for the same
parameters as in Fig. 1. Our perturbation analysis accurately captures the coherent motion
of the full system except near the stochastic region ρ
min(νi) where our perturbation
theory breaks down. Below this region, ρ and ¯ρ diﬀer by small ﬂuctuations that are accounted
for, to O(ǫ), by the transformation (16).

IV. COHERENT MOTION FOR PERPENDICULAR WAVES

Using the Hamiltonian (17) we now analyze the ion motion for two perpendicularly prop-
agating waves. Figures 1 and 3 show the complete and coherent motion, respectively, for two
perpendicularly propagating waves (kiz = 0). Figure 4 displays H+ and H− from (20) for
the same parameters as in Figs. 1 and 3, and the values of ˜H for the three initial conditions.
The coherent analysis correctly predicts that particle 3 in Fig. 1 will not make it into the
chaotic regime because it is reﬂected by the bump in H−.

If we multiply ǫ1 and ǫ2 by the same factor a then ˜H in (17) is multiplied by a2 (note
that for perpendicularly propagating waves, 1
2 ¯v2
z is a constant and can be eliminated from
˜H). Since a rescaling of the Hamiltonian is equivalent to a rescaling of time, rescaling both
ǫi’s does not aﬀect the range of motion in ¯ρ but rescales the period by 1/a2. For ǫ1 ∼
ǫ2,
this means the period scales like 1/ǫ2
1. This reﬂects the fact that the coherent motion is

6

(21)

(22)

(23)

second-order in the wave ﬁeld amplitudes. It also shows that in certain physical situations,
at suﬃciently large amplitudes, the eﬀects of collisions on the coherent energization can be
made negligible.

The range of coherent motion in ρ scales linearly with the wave frequencies. In Fig. 5

potential barriers do not change signiﬁcantly with ν1. Figure 6 shows that, as a function
of ν1, the average ξmin and ξmax have a small variation (ξmin and ξmax are the maximum
and minimum ξ attained by an ion undergoing coherent motion and occur when the ion
reaches the barriers H±). The average is over ions with the same initial ξ0 = 0.4 and
diﬀerent φ0 = (0, 0.05, . . . , 1)π. Waves with higher frequencies can therefore produce co-
herent energization to higher energies. Since the lower bound of the stochastic region is
1, ions with the same initial ξ0 and φ0 either will or will not reach the
ρ
stochastic region regardless of the wave frequencies. For ν1 near an integer ξmax is about
20% higher than when ν1 is near a half-integer (this is not shown explicitly in Fig. 6).

V. COHERENT MOTION FOR OBLIQUE WAVES

wavenumber kiz. This couples the parallel dynamics to the perpendicular motion.

A. Equal Parallel Wavenumbers: ∆kz = 0

Figures 8 and 9 show the time evolution of ρ and vz for two waves propagating at an angle
of 45◦ (kiz = kix = 1) to ~B0. As in the case of two perpendicularly propagating waves, there
is coherent change in ρ. During this coherent evolution vz has small-amplitude ﬂuctuations
around its initial value. In the region where the motion in ρ becomes stochastic so does the
motion in vz. The stochastic region in vz agrees with the estimate given above. Since ¯vz is
a constant during the coherent motion, the ﬂuctuations in vz are due to the transformation
between ¯vz and vz.

The main eﬀect of equal parallel wavenumbers is to slightly decrease the range of coherent
motion from what it is for perpendicularly propagating waves, thus inhibiting some ions from

Consequently, more ions are reﬂected by H− and the range of coherent motion in ρ is slightly
lowered. This is evident from Fig. 10, which shows H±/H+(¯ρ = 0) for k1z = 0.1 and 1.
Figure 11 shows the range of motion ξmin, ξmax for diﬀerent k1z. Increasing kiz slightly lowers
ξmax since the enhanced bump in H− reﬂects more ions. Generally then, signiﬁcant coherent
energization and access to the stochastic region is obtainable with oblique waves provided
that ∆kz = 0, while the normalized kz may be large.

When the parallel wavenumbers of the two waves are diﬀerent, the coherent motion of
the ions changes drastically. In this case vz undergoes coherent motion and the term 1

˜H (17) is no longer a constant. This limits the range in ρ as ∆kz is increased. Figures 12

less eﬀective. The coherent change in vz thus limits itself, which keeps R close to an integer.
Since the coherent changes in ¯ρ and ¯vz are linked via (19), the coherent change in ¯ρ is also
small.

This situation is analogous to the case of two perpendicularly propagating waves when
the wave frequencies do not diﬀer by an integer [13]. Following Section IV.C of [13], the
approximate Hamiltonian, correct to second order in wave amplitudes, that describes the
coherent motion is

Figures 15 and 16 demonstrate the range of coherent motion versus ∆kz and ∆ν, respectively,
and validate the scalings in (30) and (31) with wave frequency. As the wave frequencies are
increased, ∆kz and ∆ν must be much smaller for ions to be energized to the stochastic
region. Hence, just as in the cases of perpendicular propagation or ∆kz = 0, for nonzero but
small ∆kz energization by waves with low frequencies is more advantageous than by waves
with high frequencies.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that two electrostatic waves propagating obliquely to an ambient mag-
netic ﬁeld can coherently energize ions when their Doppler-shifted frequencies diﬀer by a

9

multiple of the ion cyclotron frequency. A second-order Hamiltonian, derived using the Lie
perturbation technique, accurately describes the coherent motion and agrees well with nu-
merical simulations of the complete dynamical equations. The energization of ions occurs
regardless of the angle of wave propagation provided the parallel wavenumbers of the two
waves are approximately equal. If the parallel wavenumbers are equal, there is no coherent
acceleration along ~B0 but considerable stochastic energization both along and across ~B0.
Moreover, the perpendicular coherent motion is quite similar to the case of perpendicularly
propagating waves. There is a small amount of coherent acceleration along ~B0 when the
parallel wavenumbers diﬀer, but this causes the resonance condition to be violated. A dif-

and the nearest integer.

There is no threshold ion energy or wave amplitude required for the coherent acceleration.
The change in the ion gyroradius is linear in the wave frequencies and independent of wave
amplitude. The period of coherent motion is inversely proportional to the square of the wave
amplitudes and is proportional to the fourth power of the wave frequency ω (ω
ω2).
ω1 ∼
Furthermore, the deviation from resonance ∆ω = ω1 −
Nωci for which appreciable
coherent acceleration occurs scales like ω−4, while the range in ∆kz = k1z −
k2z for coherent
motion scales like ω−3. This implies that for lower-frequency waves coherent ion acceleration
is faster and less sensitive to small changes in wave parameters.

Coherent ion energization occurs for two waves with appropriately chosen frequencies and
could occur for a broadband spectrum of waves extending over at least two ωci in frequency.
These situations leading to coherent energization of ions can be produced in the laboratory
with coherent radiation sources and occur naturally in the Earth’s ionosphere. Detailed
analyses of a broad spectrum of waves, and of the eﬀects of weak collisions, remain to be
carried out in future work.

APPENDIX A: LIE PERTURBATION METHOD FOR TWO OBLIQUE WAVES

We develop the Lie perturbation method following [19] and [18] and follow the notation

in Section 2.5 of [19].

The Lie method provides a Hamiltonian ¯H that describes just the coherent motion, and
a change of coordinates that accounts for the incoherent ﬂuctuations. The physical variables
x = (q, p) are governed by the full Hamiltonian H(x), and the new coordinates ¯x = (¯q, ¯p)
are governed by ¯H(¯x). ¯x depends on x and a parameter ǫ which orders the perturbation via

∂ ¯x
∂ǫ

= [¯x, w(¯x, t)]¯x,

¯x(ǫ = 0) = x

(A1)

where [f, g]x =
(∂f /∂pi)(∂g/∂qi)] is the Poisson bracket. The old
coordinates enter only as a condition for ǫ = 0, which ensures that the transformation for
P
any w is canonical and near-identity.

i[(∂f /∂qi)(∂g/∂pi)

−

The operator T relates the representation of a physical quantity f in the two coordinate

systems by f (¯x) = (T f )(x). In particular, f (¯x) = ¯x gives ¯x = T x. T satisﬁes

¯H is given by

∂T

f (x) =

T [w(x, t), f (x)]x

¯H(¯x) = T −1H(x) + T −1

The second term is not needed for an autonomous system.

We expand w, H, T, and ¯H in powers of ǫ and equate terms at each order in ǫ. Collecting
terms in (A3) at each order in ǫ gives equations for wi. Upon carrying out the perturbation
expansion to second order in ǫ, we ﬁnd

D0w1 = ¯H1 −

D0w2 = 2( ¯H2 −

D0f
∂tf +[f, H0] is the time derivative along the unperturbed trajectories. All expressions
here are functions of the same set of coordinates. For simplicity we use x for this purpose,
but the ﬁnal expression for ¯H governs the evolution of ¯x. Clearly, ¯H0 = H0.

For T to be a near-identity operator, w must remain small. We choose ¯Hi in the right-
hand side of (A4) and (A5) to eliminate any terms that would violate this condition. Such
terms are referred to as “resonant” terms.

For the two-wave problem, H0 and H1 are given in (7), while Hi = 0 for i

Bessel-function identity (see p. 361 of [22]), we obtain

The unperturbed orbits are φ = t + φ0, z = z0, vz = 0, I = I0 (in a frame where the ion’s

(A7), so we choose ¯H1 = 0. Then

˜H is a constant of the motion.

When only one resonance condition is satisﬁed, we ﬁnd a second constant of the motion
(∆kz/N) ¯I).
besides ˜H, which relates ¯I and ¯vz (when only N is an integer, this constant is ¯vz −
The dynamical system described by (A18) is thus completely integrable. When any two
resonance conditions are satisﬁed it is easy to see that ν1 and ν2 must both be half-integers.
Then all four resonance conditions are satisﬁed. It does not appear that, in this case, there
exists a second constant of the motion. The dynamics described by ˜H could be stochastic.

40.37 (dashed) and the other wave parameters as in Fig. 1. Initial conditions and averaging are as
in Fig. 6. The abscissa for ν1 = 40.37 has been rescaled by (10.37/40.37)4. If the scaling in (31)
were exact, the dotted and dashed lines would coincide.

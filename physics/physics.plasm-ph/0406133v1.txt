Two-ﬂuid magnetic island dynamics in slab geometry:

II - Islands interacting with resistive walls or static

external resonant magnetic perturbations

Richard Fitzpatrick∗ and Fran¸cois L. Waelbroeck

Austin, TX 78712

The dynamics of a propagating magnetic island interacting with a resis-

tive wall or a static external resonant magnetic perturbation is investigated

using two-ﬂuid, drift-MHD (magnetohydrodynamical) theory in slab geome-

try. In both cases, the island equation of motion is found to take exactly the

same form as that predicted by single-ﬂuid MHD theory. Three separate ion

polarization terms are found in the Rutherford island width evolution equa-

tion. The ﬁrst is the drift-MHD polarization term for an isolated island, and

is completely unaﬀected by the interaction with a wall or magnetic perturba-

tion. Next, there is the polarization term due to interaction with a wall or

magnetic perturbation which is predicted by single-ﬂuid MHD theory. This

term is always destabilizing. Finally, there is a hybrid of the other two po-

larization terms. The sign of this term depends on many factors. However,

under normal circumstances, it is stabilizing if the unperturbed island prop-

agates in the ion diamagnetic direction (in the lab. frame), and destabilizing

if it propagates in the electron diamagnetic direction.

I. INTRODUCTION

Tearing modes are magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) instabilities which often limit fusion

plasma performance in magnetic conﬁnement devices relying on nested toroidal magnetic

ﬂux-surfaces.1 As the name suggests, “tearing” modes tear and reconnect magnetic ﬁeld-

lines, in the process converting nested toroidal ﬂux-surfaces into helical magnetic islands.

Such islands degrade plasma conﬁnement because heat and particles are able to travel ra-

dially from one side of an island to another by ﬂowing along magnetic ﬁeld-lines, which is a

relatively fast process, instead of having to diﬀuse across magnetic ﬂux-surfaces, which is a

relatively slow process.2

The interaction of rotating magnetic islands with resistive walls3–11 and external res-
onant magnetic perturbations5,7,12–14 has been the subject of a great deal of research in

the magnetic fusion community, since such interactions can have a highly deleterious ef-

fect on plasma conﬁnement. This paper focuses on the ion polarization corrections to the

Rutherford island width evolution equation15 which arise from the highly sheared ion ﬂow

proﬁles generated around magnetic islands whose rotation frequencies are shifted by interac-

tion with either resistive walls or external magnetic perturbations. According to single-ﬂuid

MHD (magnetohydrodynamical) theory,9,14 such polarization corrections are always desta-

bilizing. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the ion polarization corrections using two-ﬂuid,

drift-MHD theory, which is far more relevant to present-day magnetic conﬁnement devices

than single-ﬂuid theory. This goal is achieved by extending the analysis of the companion

paper,16 which investigates the dynamics of an isolated magnetic island in slab geometry us-

ing two-ﬂuid, drift-MHD theory. For the sake of simplicity, we shall restrict our investigation

to slab geometry.

II. REDUCED EQUATIONS

A. Basic equations

Standard right-handed Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are adopted. Consider a quasi-

neutral plasma with singly-charged ions of mass mi. The ion/electron number density n0 is

assumed to be uniform and constant. Suppose that Ti = τ Te, where Ti,e is the ion/electron

temperature, and τ is uniform and constant. Let there be no variation of quantities in the

z-direction: i.e., ∂/∂z

0. Finally, let all lengths be normalized to some convenient scale

≡

length a, all magnetic ﬁeld-strengths to some convenient scale ﬁeld-strength Ba, and all

times to a/Va, where Va = Ba/√µ0 n0 mi.

We can write B =

ψ

∇

×

ˆz + (B0 + bz) ˆz, and P = P0 −

B0 bz + O(1), where B is the

magnetic ﬁeld, and P the total plasma pressure. Here, we are assuming that B0 ≫
with ψ and bz both O(1).16 Let, β = Γ P0/B 2

0 be (Γ times) the plasma beta calculated with

P0 ≫

1,

the “guide-ﬁeld”, B0, where Γ = 5/3 is the plasma ratio of speciﬁc heats. Note that the

above ordering scheme does not constrain β to be either much less than or much greater

than unity.

Furthermore, η is the (uniform) plasma resistivity, µi e the (uniform) ion/electron viscosity,

κ the (uniform) plasma thermal conductivity, and J0(x) (minus) the inductively maintained,

equilibrium plasma current in the z-direction. The above equations contain both electron

and ion diamagnetic eﬀects, including the contribution of the anisotropic ion gyroviscous

tensor, but neglect electron inertia. Our equations are “reduced” in the sense that they do

not contain the compressible Alfv´en wave. However, they do contain the shear-Alfv´en wave,

the magnetoacoustic wave, the whistler wave, and the kinetic-Alfv´en wave.

B. Plasma equilibrium

The plasma equilibrium satisﬁes ∂/∂y

0. Suppose that the plasma is bounded by

rigid walls at x =

xw, and that the region beyond the walls is a vacuum. The equilibrium

±

magnetic ﬂux is written ψ(0)(x), where ψ(0)(

x) = ψ(0)(x), and d2ψ(0)(x)/dx2 = J0(x). The

scale magnetic ﬁeld-strength, Ba, is chosen such that ψ(0)(x)

equilibrium value of the ﬁeld Z takes the form Z (0)(x) =

C. Asymptotic matching

Consider a tearing perturbation which is periodic in the y-direction with periodicity

length l. According to conventional analysis, the plasma is conveniently split into two

regions.17 The “outer region” comprises most of the plasma, and is governed by the equations

of linearized, ideal-MHD. On the other hand, the “inner region” is localized in the vicinity

of the magnetic resonance x = 0 (where B(0)

y = 0). Non-linear, dissipative, and drift-MHD

eﬀects all become important in the inner region.

In the outer region, we can write ψ(x, y, t) = ψ(0)(x)+ψ(1)(x, t) exp(i k y), where k = 2π/l

III. INTERACTION WITH A RESISTIVE WALL

A. Introduction

Suppose that the walls bounding the plasma at x =

xw are thin and resistive, with time-

±

constant τw. We can deﬁne the perfect-wall tearing eigenfunction, ψpw(x), as the continuous

even (in x) solution to Eq. (5) which satisﬁes ψpw(0) = 1, and ψpw(

xw) = 0. Likewise,

±

the no-wall tearing eigenfunction, ψnw(x), is the continuous even solution to Eq. (5) which

satisﬁes ψpw(0) = 1, and ψpw(

) = 0. In general, both ψpw(x), and ψnw(x) have gradient

±∞
discontinuities at x = 0. The quantity ∆pw = [dψpw/dx]0+
stability index17 in the presence of a perfectly conducting wall (i.e., τw → ∞
∆nw = [dψnw/dx]0+

0− > ∆pw is the tearing stability index in the presence of no wall (i.e.,

0− is the conventional tearing

), whereas

0). Finally, the wall eigenfunction, ψw(x), is deﬁned as the continuous even solution

τw →
to Eq. (5) which satisﬁes ψw(0) = 0, ψw(

xw) = 1, and ψw(

) = 0. This eigenfunction

±

±∞

has additional gradient discontinuities at x =

xw. The wall stability index, ∆w < 0, is

±

deﬁned ∆w = [dψw/dx]xw+
xw−.

According to standard analysis,7 the eﬀective tearing stability index, ∆′ = [d ln ψ/dx]0+

in the presence of a resistive wall is written

B. Island geometry

In the inner region, we can write

ψ(x, θ, t) =

+ Ψ (t) cos θ,

(8)

where θ = k y. As is well-known, the above expression for ψ describes a constant-ψ magnetic

island of full-width (in the x-direction) W = 4 w, where w = √Ψ . The region inside the

magnetic separatrix corresponds to ψ >

Ψ , whereas the region outside the separatrix

corresponds to ψ

C. Ordering scheme

In the inner region, we adopt the following ordering of terms appearing in Eqs. (1)–(4):

and sub-magnetoacoustic) diamagnetic ﬂows, and very long (i.e., very much longer than the

Alfv´en time) transport evolution time-scales.

the vicinity of the island, whereas the function F (s, ˆψ) corresponds to a non-localized proﬁle

Equation (35) is the Rutherford island width evolution equation15 for a propagating

magnetic island interacting with a resistive wall. There are three separate ion polarization

terms on the right-hand side of this equation. The ﬁrst (second term on r.h.s.) is the drift-

MHD polarization term for an isolated island (see Ref. 16), and is unaﬀected by wall braking.

This term, which varies as W −3, is stabilizing provided that the unperturbed island phase-

velocity lies between the unperturbed ion ﬂuid velocity and the unperturbed E

B velocity,

×

and is destabilizing otherwise. The third (fourth term on r.h.s.) is the single-ﬂuid MHD

polarization term due to the island velocity-shift induced by wall braking (see Ref. 9). This

term is always destabilizing, and varies as W −1 and the square of the wall-induced velocity-

shift. The second (third term on r.h.s.) is a hybrid of the other two polarization terms. The

11

sign of this term depends on many factors. However, in the limit of small electron viscosity

(compared to the ion viscosity), when the unperturbed island phase-velocity lies close to the

unperturbed velocity of the ion ﬂuid,16 the hybrid term is stabilizing provided V (0)

∗ y V (0) > 0,

and destabilizing otherwise. In other words, the hybrid term is stabilizing if the unperturbed

island propagates in the ion diamagnetic direction (in the lab. frame), and destabilizing if

it propagates in the electron diamagnetic direction. The hybrid polarization term varies as

W −2, and is directly proportional to the wall-induced island velocity-shift.

IV. INTERACTION WITH A STATIC EXTERNAL RESONANT MAGNETIC

PERTURBATION

A. Introduction

Let the walls bounding the plasma at x =

xw now be non-conducting (i.e., τw →
±

0).

Suppose that an even (in x) static magnetic perturbation (with the same wave-length as the

magnetic island in the plasma) is generated by currents ﬂowing in ﬁeld-coils located in the

vacuum region beyond the walls.

The no-wall tearing stability index, ∆nw, is deﬁned in Sect. III A. The coil eigenfunction,

ψc(x), is the continuous even solution to Eq. (5) which satisﬁes ψc(0) = 0 and ψc(

xw) = 1.

±

In general, this eigenfunction has a gradient discontinuity at x = 0. It is helpful to deﬁne

∆c = [dψc/dx]0+
0−.

According to standard analysis,7 the eﬀective tearing stability index, ∆′ = [d ln ψ/dx]0+
0−,

in the presence of an external magnetic perturbation is

∆′(t) = ∆nw + ∆c

cos ϕ(t),

is the reconnected magnetic ﬂux, which is assumed to vary slowly

in time, and Ψc the ﬂux at the walls solely due to currents ﬂowing in the external coils.

Furthermore, ϕ(t) is the phase of the island measured with respect to that of the external

magnetic perturbation. Since the external perturbation is stationary, it follows that

netic force acting on the island takes the form

Note that, unlike the braking force due to a resistive wall, this force oscillates in sign as the

island propagates.

B. Determination of ﬂow proﬁles

We can reuse the analysis of Sect. III D, except that we must allow for time dependence

of the function F to take into account the oscillating nature of the locking force exerted on

the island by the external perturbation. Hence, we write

where

In order to proceed further, we adopt the separable form approach to solving Eq. (45)

which was introduced and justiﬁed in Ref. 14. In other words, we try the following solution:

Equation (64) is the Rutherford island width evolution equation for a propagating island

interacting with a static external resonant magnetic perturbation. There are three separate

ion polarization terms on the right-hand side of this equation. The ﬁrst (third term on r.h.s.)

is the drift-MHD polarization term for an isolated island (see Ref. 16), and is unaﬀected by

the external perturbation. The third (ﬁfth term on r.h.s.) is the single-ﬂuid MHD polariza-

tion term due to the oscillation in island phase-velocity induced by the external perturbation

(see Ref. 14). This term modulates as the island propagates, but is always destabilizing. The

second (fourth term on r.h.s.) is a hybrid of the other two polarization terms.

E. Solution of island equations of motion

Let us solve the island equations of motion, (41) and (60), in the limit in which the

external magnetic perturbation is suﬃciently weak that it does not signiﬁcantly perturb the

island phase-velocity. Let us also assume that η is so small that the island width, W , does

not vary appreciably with island phase. In this limit, we can write

ϕ(t) = k V (0) t + αs sin(k V (0) t) + αc cos(k V (0) t),

where

ternal perturbation. The next three terms (within the curly braces) are the phase-averaged

external perturbation drive, hybrid polarization term, and single-ﬂuid MHD polarization

term, respectively. It can be seen that the external perturbation drive is on average sta-

bilizing, whereas the single-ﬂuid MHD polarization term is destabilizing.7 The sign of the

17

hybrid term depends on many factors. However, in the limit of small electron viscosity

(compared to the ion viscosity), when the unperturbed island phase-velocity lies close to the

unperturbed velocity of the ion ﬂuid,16 the hybrid term is on average stabilizing provided

V (0)
∗ y V (0) > 0, and destabilizing otherwise. In other words, the hybrid term is stabilizing if

the unperturbed island propagates in the ion diamagnetic direction (in the lab. frame), and

destabilizing if it propagates in the electron diamagnetic direction. Finally, since our analysis

is based on the fairly reasonable assumption that w/λ

1, it follows from Eq. (70) that

≪

the phase-averaged external perturbation drive dominates the phase-averaged hybrid and

single-ﬂuid MHD polarization terms. Hence, we conclude that, on average, an island prop-

agating in the presence of an external magnetic perturbation experiences a net stabilizing

eﬀect.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have investigated the dynamics of a propagating magnetic island interacting with a

resistive wall or a static external resonant magnetic perturbation using two-ﬂuid, drift-MHD

theory in slab geometry. In both cases, we ﬁnd that the island equation of motion takes

exactly the same form as that predicted by single-ﬂuid MHD theory (see Sects. III E and

IV C). However, two-ﬂuid eﬀects do give rise to additional ion polarization terms in the

Rutherford island width evolution equation.

In general, we ﬁnd that there are three separate ion polarization terms in the Rutherford

equation (see Sects. III F and IV D). The ﬁrst is the drift-MHD polarization term for an iso-

lated island, and is completely unaﬀected by interaction with a resistive wall or an external

magnetic perturbation. Next, there is the polarization term due to interaction with a resis-

tive wall or magnetic perturbation which is predicted by single-ﬂuid MHD theory. This term

is always destabilizing. Finally, there is a hybrid of the other two polarization terms. The

sign of this term depends on many factors. However, in the limit of small electron viscosity

(compared to the ion viscosity), when the unperturbed island phase-velocity lies close to

18

the unperturbed velocity of the ion ﬂuid,16 the hybrid term is stabilizing if the unperturbed

island propagates in the ion diamagnetic direction (in the lab. frame), and destabilizing if it

propagates in the electron diamagnetic direction.

It is also demonstrated that a propagating magnetic island interacting with a static

external resonant magnetic perturbation generally experiences a net stabilizing eﬀect (see

Sect. IV E). This follows because in the Rutherford island width evolution equation the

phase-averaged drive term due to the external perturbation (which is stabilizing) is gen-

erally much larger than either the phase-averaged hybrid polarization term (which can be

destabilizing) or the phase-averaged single-ﬂuid MHD polarization term (which is destabi-

lizing).

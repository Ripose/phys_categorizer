Abstract

A kinetic equation describing the nonlinear evolution of intense electromagnetic pulses in

electron–positron (e-p) plasmas is presented. The modulational instability is analyzed for a rel-

ativistically intense partially coherent pulse, and it is found that the modulational instability is

inhibited by the spectral pulse broadening. A numerical study for the one-dimensional kinetic

photon equation is presented. Computer simulations reveal a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-like recurrence

phenomena for localized broadband pulses. The results should be of importance in understanding

the nonlinear propagation of broadband intense electromagnetic pulses in e-p plasmas in laser-

plasma systems as well as in astrophysical plasma settings.

I. INTRODUCTION

Electron-positron plasmas are believed to be an important ingredient of the early universe

and in astrophysical objects such as pulsars, supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei,

and in gamma-ray bursts [1].

In such extreme environments, the electron-positron pairs

may be created by collisions between particles that are accelerated by electromagnetic and

electrostatic waves and/or by gravitational forces. In pulsar environments, there is also a

possibility of pair creation via high-energy curvature radiation photons that are triggered by

charged particles streaming along the curved magnetic ﬁeld [2], with a resulting collection

of positrons at the polar caps of the pulsar [3, 4]. High-energy laser-plasma interactions

and fusion devices on Earth also constitute a source of electron-positron plasmas. Experi-
ments with petawatt lasers (with intensities exceeding 1020 W/cm2) have demonstrated the

production of MeV electrons and evidence of positron production via electron collisions

[5, 6]. Positrons are also believed to be created in post-disruption plasmas in large tokamaks

through collisions between MeV electrons and thermal particles [7].

Various collective phenomena in electron-positron plasmas have been demonstrated in the

laboratory, such as the creation of wake ﬁelds by ultra-relativistic positron beams [8] and

two-stream instabilities in streaming electron-positron plasmas [9]. The natural saturation

mechanism for a two-stream instability is particle trapping in which electrons and positrons

are trapped in the electrostatic potential of the large-amplitude wave. Theoretical and

numerical studies have shown that solitary electron/positron holes can exist both in a non-

relativistic pair plasma [10, 11, 12] and in a relativistically hot electron-positron-ion plasma

[13]. Intense electromagnetic radiation introduces a new nonlinearity in the electron-positron

plasma via the relativistic mass increase of the plasma particles in the quivering electric ﬁeld

of the electromagnetic waves [14, 15]. It has been demonstrated theoretically that relativistic

electromagnetic solitary waves can exist in a cold electron-positron plasma, if there is an

inclusion of massive ions [18]. Several authors [16, 17] have also considered the nonlinear

propagation of small amplitude electromagnetic waves and Alfv´en vortices in a strongly

magnetized electron-positron plasma.

Over recent years, the laser pulse intensity has been strongly increasing, and over the

next ﬁve to ten years it is expected to reach focal intensities of

1026 W/cm2 [19]. Thus,

∼

the interaction between plasmas and intense laser pulses is currently of great interest [20,

2

21, 22, 23, 24]. As laser intensities keep increasing, laboratory plasma experiments will

experience the eﬀects of the nonlinear quantum vacuum [25], such as pair creation and

photon splitting. Theoretical studies of nonlinear laser-plasma interactions mostly make

the simpliﬁed assumption of a coherent, monochromatic wave propagation in plasmas. It is

then relatively easy to derive analytic expressions for various instabilities (e.g. relativistic

Raman forward and backward scattering instabilities and the modulational instability in an

electron-ion plasma [26]) and the formation of envelope electromagnetic solitons [27].

However, the assumption about a monochromatic wave is not always true, e.g.

if the

electromagnetic waves are excited via turbulent processes. Then, we would have a distri-

bution of waves with diﬀerent wavelengths and frequencies that are only partially coherent.

Theories for photon acceleration of partially coherent waves have been developed in the

framework of nonlinear optics [28] and are based on the Wigner’s kinetic description [29].

The latter has been used to investigate the nonlinear instability of random phased small

amplitude electromagnetic waves in a nonlinear dispersive medium [30].

In this paper, we consider the nonlinear propagation of relativistically intense broadband

laser pulses in an electron–positron plasma.

In order to analyze the properties of such

partially coherent laser pulses, we perform a Wigner analysis of the modiﬁed nonlinear

Schr¨odinger equation, and obtain a wave kinetic equation for the photon quasi-particles.

The resulting kinetic equation is investigated both analytically and numerically. Speciﬁcally,

we present the modulational instability and the dynamics of partially coherent intense laser

pulses. It is found that the partial coherence of the laser pulse yields a reduced growth rate

for the modulational instability. The fully nonlinear evolution of the wave kinetic equation

is investigated by means of numerical simulations. The latter show a complex dynamics of

broadband laser pulses in that the laser envelope contracts and disperses in a quasi-periodic

manner, somewhat similar to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence phenomenon encountered for

the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. The present results should be useful for understanding

the nonlinear propagation of broadband intense electromagnetic pulses through pair plasmas

such as those in laser-plasma systems and in astrophysical settings.

II. GOVERNING EQUATIONS AND THE MODULATIONAL INSTABILITY

Let us consider the nonlinear propagation of intense circularly polarized electromagnetic

waves in pair plasmas without ions. Accounting for the relativistic mass increase of the pairs

and quasi-stationary density ﬂuctuations driven by the relativistic ponderomotive force,

Shukla et al. [31] derived the fully nonlinear equation

which shows the evolution of the normalized vector potential in pair plasmas. Here a =

p

eA/mc2 is the normalized vector potential, A is the amplitude of the circularly polarized

vector potential, m is the electron mass, e is the magnitude of the electron charge, c is the

speed of light in vacuum, β = 2βeβp/(βe + βp) is the dimensionless temperature parameter
with βe,p = (c/vT e,p)2, vT e,p = (Te,p/m)1/2 is the thermal speed, Te (Tp) is the electron

ω0/ω2

(positron) temperature, we have normalized the time and co-moving spatial variables by
p and c/ωp, respectively, ωp = (4πn0e2/m)1/2 is the electron plasma frequency, n0 is
the unperturbed electron density, and ω0 is the central wave frequency. Numerical analysis of

Eq. (1) revealed that weakly modulated electromagnetic (em) pulses would undergo collapse,

leading to strong intensiﬁcation of the localized em pulses.

Even though Eq. (1) contains a saturation nonlinearity, halting of collapse could be ob-

tained by spectral broadening techniques, well-known in inertial conﬁnement fusion. More-

over, in many applications of such an equation, for example astrophysical systems, the pulses

can be partially coherent. Thus, understanding the dynamics and stability of electromag-

netic pulses taking incoherence eﬀects into account may be important for practical purposes.

A canonical way for analyzing eﬀects of partial coherence is to use the so called Wigner

function, deﬁned as the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation function of the vector

potential a according to [28, 29]

However, the photon kinetic limit is only valid for weak spatial variations in ρ, and produces

a modulational instability growth rate which is unbounded as the wavenumber of the photons

increases. Thus, for a broad spatial spectral distribution of photons the dynamics of the

Liouville equation is highly unstable and strongly deviates from the full Wigner dynamics,

and will therefore not be analyzed further here.

Equations (3) and (4) constitute a complete description of partially coherent nonlinear

photons in an electron–positron plasma.

Next, we perform a perturbation analysis of Eq. (4). Letting ρ = ρ0(k) + ρ1 exp(iK

intense electromagnetic pulses in pair plasmas, we carry out the numerical analysis of the

and the same parameters as in Fig. 1. In Figs. 2 and 3, we use I0 = 1/4, ∆ = 0.1, and
k0 = 0.1 as initial conditions. A small amplitude noise (random numbers of order 10−3) is

added to the initial condition to give a seed for the modulational instability.

We display the temporal evolution of the em wave intensity I in Fig. 2. Here we see

an initially linear growth phase and a wave collapse that takes place around t = 90. The

wavelength of the collapsing pulse is approximately λ = 10, and thus the most unstable mode
is k∗ = 2π/10

0.6, in good agreement with the theoretical prediction in Fig. 1. After the

≈

initial pulse collapse, the solution shows a chaotic behavior, where some localized envelopes

show a semi-periodic behavior, and we also see a sequence of merging and splitting of wave

groups. This behavior is somewhat similar to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence phenomenon

[34], which has been observed in nonlinear optics experiments [35] and has been explained

theoretically in the framework of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation [36, 37].

In Fig. 3,

we show Wigner’s distribution function ρ at diﬀerent times. (It is obtained by numerically

inverse Fourier transforming

ρ to obtain the real-valued ρ.) We note that the distribution

function shows a complex dynamics and takes both positive and negative values, in contrast

to solutions of the Vlasov equation for particles that takes only positive values. In Figs. 4 and

b

5, we repeated the simulation with the larger spectral width ∆ = 0.3 in the initial conditions.

We used the same intensity I0 = 1/4, as in the ﬁrst simulation, and we used k0 = 0.05. For

this case, the temporal evolution of the pulse intensity, as shown in Fig. 4, exhibits a slower

growth rate (compared to Fig. 2 with the smaller ∆ = 0.1), and nonlinearly collapsing

wave envelopes have smaller intensity maxima. The snap shots of the Wigner distribution

function, depicted in Fig. 5, shows the initial instability and merging of nonlinear structures

corresponding to merging wave envelopes in Fig. 4. Thus, a larger spectral width ∆ leads

to a slower and less violent dynamics of the wave envelopes that also have larger scale sizes

than for the smaller values of ∆. We recall that the theoretical treatment predicts that there

is a largest ∆ above which the modulational instability vanishes, and we would instead have

damping of waves similar as Landau damping for the Vlasov equation.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we have investigated the modulational instability and the nonlinear dynam-

ics of partially coherent intense electromagnetic (em) waves in an electron-positron plasma,

8

taking into account the relativistic mass increase of the pairs as well as large scale density

ﬂuctuations that are created by the relativistic ponderomotive force of em waves. The dy-

namics of broadband intense em waves is governed by a photon kinetic (or the Liouville)

equation. The latter is analyzed to obtain a nonlinear dispersion relation, which admits the

modulational instability growth rate for a Lorentzian distribution of partially coherent in-

tense em waves. It is found that a broadband of em waves leads to a reduction of the growth

rate. Furthermore, the photon kinetic equation has been numerically solved to understand

the nonlinear dynamics of modulationally unstable broadband intense em pulses. Our sim-

ulation results reveal the formation of localized em wave packets that show some similarity

to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence phenomenon. For larger values of the spectral width,

the system shows a dynamics on a slower timescale and on larger length scales, in agreement

with the linear theory. The present results should help to understand the nonlinear propa-

gation of broadband intense electromagnetic waves in pair plasmas that appear in inertial

conﬁnement fusion schemes as well as in pulsar magnetosphere and supernovae remnants.

ing intensity in Fig. 2. For the initial conditions we used I = I0 = 1/4, ∆ = 0.1 and k0 = 0.1.

Figure 4 (Color online): The intensity I as a function of x and t. The parameters used in

the initial condition are I = I0 = 1/4, ∆ = 0.3 and k0 = 0.05.

Figure 5 (Color online): The Wigner distribution function ρ as a function of x and kx, at

times t = 0, t = 300, t = 400 and t = 500 (upper to lower panels), with the corresponding

intensity in Fig. 4. For the initial conditions we used I = I0 = 1/4, ∆ = 0.3 and k0 = 0.05.

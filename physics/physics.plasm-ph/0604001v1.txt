A Model for Spontaneous Onset of Fast Magnetic Reconnection

P. A. Cassak1, J. F. Drake1 and M. A. Shay2

ABSTRACT

We present a model for the spontaneous onset of fast magnetic reconnection
in a weakly collisional plasma, such as the solar corona. When a current layer of
macroscopic width undergoes collisional (Sweet-Parker) reconnection, a narrow
dissipation region forms around the X-line. This dissipation region naturally
becomes narrower during the reconnection process as stronger magnetic ﬁelds
are convected toward the X-line. When the dissipation region becomes thinner
than the ion skin depth, resistive magnetohydrodynamics breaks down as the
Hall eﬀect becomes important and the Sweet-Parker solution ceases to exist. A
transition to collisionless (Hall) reconnection ensues, increasing the reconnection
rate by many orders of magnitude in a very short time. Predictions of the model
are consistent with constraints set by observations of solar ﬂares.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic reconnection is the driver of explosions in the solar corona. The ﬁrst self-
consistent description of magnetic reconnection, the Sweet-Parker model (Sweet 1958; Parker
1957), was immediately recognized as yielding energy release rates too slow to explain obser-
vations. Petschek reconnection (Petschek 1964) and related models (Priest & Forbes 1986)
can be much faster, but requires anomalous resistivity (Sato & Hayashi 1979; Biskamp 1986),
a process which is not well understood. In the past 10-15 years, a new paradigm of colli-
sionless (Hall) reconnection has emerged, in which non-magnetohydrodynamic terms make
reconnection much faster (Birn et al. 2001), about six orders of magnitude faster for solar

ﬂare parameters. Signatures of Hall reconnection have been observed in magnetospheric
observations (Oieroset et al. 2001; Mozer et al. 2002) and laboratory experiments (Cothran
et al. 2003; Ren et al. 2005).

However, explaining observed reconnection rates is only part of the problem. One must
also explain why reconnection is explosive: explaining how magnetic energy can accumulate
without signiﬁcant dissipation and identifying the mechanism triggering the onset of fast
(Hall) reconnection to release the stored energy are long-standing problems.

Recently, Cassak et al. (2005) showed that a catastrophic transition from Sweet-Parker
to Hall reconnection occurs when the width δ of the Sweet-Parker dissipation region falls
below the ion skin depth di = c/ωpi, where ωpi = (4πne2/mi)1/2 is the ion plasma frequency
and n is the plasma density. This is the length scale at which magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) breaks down and the Hall term in the generalized Ohm’s law becomes important.
For δ < di, the Sweet-Parker solution ceases to exist, and an abrupt transition to Hall
reconnection ensues.

The catastrophic transition to Hall reconnection when δ

di was demonstrated by
(externally) decreasing the resistivity η. However, the idea that a solar eruption is caused
by a change in the resistivity by a large enough amount to cause a transition from colli-
sional to collisionless reconnection requires ad hoc assumptions about the poorly understood

result of the dissipation region thinning due to the convection of stronger magnetic ﬁelds
into the dissipation region during slow Sweet-Parker reconnection. This is a generic process
which is entirely self-driven: it relies on no external forcing or ﬁne tuning of any parameters.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst self-consistent model for the spontaneous onset of fast
reconnection.

To see why transitions to fast reconnection are generic to the reconnection process,
consider a macroscopic current sheet with a small but non-negligible resistivity. Without
small scale structure, the Hall term in Ohm’s law is unimportant, so the system undergoes
Sweet-Parker reconnection. Since the resistivity is small, the dissipation region is embedded
within the macroscopic current sheet. The width δ of the Sweet-Parker current layer is given

The physics of Hall reconnection is fundamentally diﬀerent from that of Sweet-Parker.
The motion of ions decouples from that of the electrons and the magnetic ﬁeld at a distance
di from the X-line. The electrons remain frozen-in to the magnetic ﬁeld down to the electron
skin depth de = c/ωpe. Where the species are decoupled, the Hall term in Ohm’s law
introduces whistler and/or kinetic Alfv´en waves (depending on the plasma β) into the system

dispersive property of these waves causes the outﬂow jet from the X-line to open as discussed
by Petschek (Rogers et al. 2001). In the absence of dispersive waves, reconnection is slow as
in the Sweet-Parker model.

Numerical simulations (Shay et al. 1999; Huba & Rudakov 2004; Shay et al. 2004) have

transition from Sweet-Parker to Hall reconnection occurs.

3. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS

We perform numerical simulations using the massively parallel compressible two-ﬂuid
code F3D (Shay et al. 2004) in a periodic two-dimensional domain. The initial equilib-
rium magnetic ﬁeld is a double current sheet conﬁguration given by one period of a sine
sheet, Bx0(y) = B0 cos(2πy/Ly), where Ly is the size of the domain in the inﬂow di-
rection, with pressure balance enforced by a non-uniform density proﬁle, n(y) = n0 +
0/8πT0) sin2(2πy/Ly). Here, n0 is a constant corresponding to the density at the edge
(B2
of the domain and T0 = B2
0/4πn0 is the temperature, assumed constant and uniform for
simplicity. The initial density at the center of the current sheet is, therefore, 1.5n0. We
impose no initial guide ﬁeld. Lengths are normalized to the ion skin depth di0 based on the
density n0 at the edge of the computational domain, not the center of the X-line, which we
denote as diX. Magnetic ﬁeld strengths, velocities, times, and resistivities are normalized to
B0, the Alfv´en speed cA0 based on B0 and n0, the ion cyclotron time Ω−1

and η0 = 4πcA0di0/c2, respectively.

the electron scales which does not impact the rate of Hall reconnection. A small coherent
[sin(2πx/Lx) sin2(2πy/Ly)] is used to initiate
perturbation B1 =
reconnection. The resistivity is taken to be uniform. Simulations are performed with η =
0.0025η0 and 0.0090η0, both of which exhibit transitions to fast reconnection. We present
results from the η = 0.0025η0 simulation, which was initialized from the η = 0.0090η0

behavior, but it dies away (by t

When the system is evolved in time, the Hall eﬀect is initially very small because the
width of the current layer Ly/2 = 102.4di0 is large compared to diX, so the system evolves
essentially as it would in pure resistive MHD. A Sweet-Parker current layer develops, as we
will demonstrate later. The ion and electron inﬂow velocities, measured as the maximum
value of the inﬂow into the X-line for each species, are plotted as a function of time late in the
simulation in Figure 1a. Up until t

in MHD. The inﬂow speed is very small, but is slowly rising due to a gradual increase in

the upstream magnetic ﬁeld strength Bup as stronger magnetic ﬁelds are convected into the
dissipation region. Figure 1b shows the slow increase in Bup, measured just upstream of the
current layer in the simulation.

When the ions decouple from the electrons, the inﬂow speeds begin to increase dramati-
cally and the system begins a transition to Hall reconnection. This transition initiates when
the width of the current layer δ falls below diX, as is shown in Figure 1c. The thick solid line
is diX as a function of time. After decoupling, one must distinguish between the electron
and ion current sheet widths, which we denote as δe and δi, respectively. The solid line is
δe, determined by the half width at half maximum of the total current layer. The dashed
line is δi, determined by the greater of δe and the half width at half maximum of the total
inﬂow current. The latter becomes non-zero where the electrons and ions decouple, and is
therefore a measure of the edge of the ion dissipation region. One can see δi decreasing from
large scales (larger than diX) as the upstream magnetic ﬁeld increases, and the transition
begins when it is of the order of diX.

Finally, to verify that the system is undergoing Sweet-Parker before the transition, and
Hall reconnection after, we must check the validity of the inﬂow speed predictions from
equations (2) and (3). The thick solid line of Figure 1d shows vin as a function of time.

Figure 2a, showing the characteristic elongated dissipation region (similar to those observed
with pure MHD simulations by Jemella et al. (2004)). After a relatively brief transition
time lasting until t
ci , the inﬂow speed is well modeled by the Hall prediction.
A grayscale plot of the current layer during the Hall phase (at t = 19.6 kΩ−1
ci ) is shown in
Figure 2b, showing the open outﬂow conﬁguration characteristic of Hall reconnection. We
observe a large enhancement of the quadrupolar structure in the out of plane magnetic ﬁeld,
a signature of Hall reconnection (Mandt et al. 1994). Cuts across the current sheet at the
X-line normalized to its maximum value are plotted as the dashed line and dot-dashed lines
in Figure 2c, showing that δe falls to de = 0.2di during Hall reconnection, as is expected
when electron inertia provides the dissipation. For comparison, the solid line is a cut across
the initial equilibrium current sheet.

4. DISCUSSION

The spontaneous onset model presented here provides a possible explanation of why
reconnection sites in weakly collisional plasmas are apparently quiet for a long time as
magnetic energy accumulates before a sudden onset of fast magnetic reconnection releases
it. A rigorous comparison of this model with ﬂare observations is challenging because the
dissipation regions associated with the transition to fast reconnection are much narrower
than can be resolved with satellite or ground-based observations. We can, however, compare
some basic predictions with observations.

First, are macroscopic current sheets in the corona wide compared to the ion skin depth?

The time it takes for the transition from Sweet-Parker to Hall reconnection, corre-

convective time across the Sweet-Parker current sheet δ/vin, which at the transition time is
the same as the resistive time across the layer (ηc2/4πδ2)−1 and the convective time along the
layer L/vout. For our simulation, the resistive time is
ci , which compares reasonably
well with the observed time of the transition (see Figure 1d). For solar ﬂare parameters,
the resistive time across the layer is approximately 28 sec, which is comparable to the onset
times seen in ﬂares (Priest & Forbes 2002). The predicted observable parameters are quite
consistent with solar ﬂare phenomena.

The present simulations do not include the eﬀect of an out of plane (guide) ﬁeld, the more
generic conﬁguration for magnetic reconnection. It was conjectured (Cassak et al. 2005) that
the transition to fast reconnection in the presence of a guide ﬁeld is also catastrophic, but
occurs when the width of the current layer reaches the ion Larmor radius ρs = cs/Ωci, where
cs is the ion sound speed, instead of the ion skin depth di. This is because ρs is the scale where
dispersive (kinetic Alfv´en) waves become important in the presence of a guide ﬁeld (Rogers
et al. 2001). Interestingly, recent laboratory experiments at the Versatile Toroidal Facility
(Egedal et al. 2000) have observed spontaneous reconnection, and preliminary diagnostics
suggest that the width of the current layer at onset is very close to their value of the ion
Larmor radius ρs (Egedal, private communication).

Finally, Longcope et al. (2005) recently observed an active region reconnect with a
nearby ﬂux loop as it emerged from the corona. A phase of slow reconnection was observed
24 hr, during which magnetic energy accumulated in the corona. This was followed by
for
fast reconnection lasting
3 hr. The onset was sudden with no visible trigger mechanism
observed. The energy released during fast reconnection was shown to be comparable to
the energy accumulated during slow reconnection. Based on parameters inferred from the
105 km, a sheet length of
observations (a loop voltage of 109 V, a current sheet depth of 2
109 cm−3), the
L
5 V/m
fast reconnection rate was MA ∼
and a reconnecting magnetic ﬁeld of B0
4 G, consistent with Hall reconnection. These
observations provide solid evidence for the accumulation of magnetic energy during a slow
reconnection phase followed by a spontaneous onset of fast reconnection, as proposed here.

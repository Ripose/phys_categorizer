An ultra-short (about 30 fs) petawatt laser pulse focused with a wide focal spot (about 100 µm) in
−3) excites a nonlinear plasma wakeﬁeld which can accelerate injected
a rareﬁed plasma (n0 ∼ 1017cm
electrons up to the GeV energy without any pulse channelling. In these conditions, propagation
of the laser pulse with an over-critical power for relativistic self-focusing is almost the same as in
vacuum. The nonlinear quasi-plane wake plasma wave, whose amplitude and phase velocity vary
along the laser path, eﬀectively traps and accelerates injected electrons with a wide range of initial
energies. Electrons accelerated along two Rayleigh lengths (about eight centimeters) can gain an
energy up to 1 GeV. In particular, the electrons trapped from quite a long (τb ∼ 330 fs) non-resonant
electron beamlet of 1 MeV particles eventually form a low emittance bunch with energies in the
range 900 ± 50 MeV. All these conclusions follow from two-dimensional simulations performed in
cylindrical geometry by means of the fully relativistic time-averaged particle code WAKE.

In the original, or ”standard”, scheme of laser wake-
ﬁeld acceleration (LWFA) [1, 2], a laser pulse of duration
2π/ωp
smaller than a period of plasma oscillation τp ≡
excites a wake electron plasma wave (wakeﬁeld) with a
phase velocity close to the speed of light [here and else-
where, ωp = (4πn0e2/m)1/2 is the electron plasma fre-
quency, n0 is the electron plasma density, m and
are
the electron mass at rest and charge]. When the electron
density perturbation exceeds the background density, the
accelerating electric ﬁeld of the nonlinear wake can reach
tens of GV/m, which is by three orders of magnitude
higher than that can be achieved in the conventional ac-
celerators without material breakdown. To excite such
a wakeﬁeld, a short laser pulse of very high intensity is
needed, that is, I0λ2
2µm2 (where λ0
×
is a laser wavelength). Reaching this range of intensities
for lower laser energy in previous experiments [3] made
necessary a tight beam focusing. The laser focal spot
with a radius r0 ∼
10 µm gave a longitudinal extent of
accelerating plasma (estimated as two Rayleigh lengths
2ZR = 2πr2
0/λ0) of the order of a few millimeters. Hence,
the observed energy gain of electrons injected in the wake
was moderate in spite of a high accelerating gradient.
Also, very narrow plasma wake driven by a tightly fo-
cused laser is ineﬀective for trapping and acceleration of

injected electrons: the scale of radial variation was con-
siderably smaller than the axial wavelength, and most of
the electrons were expelled by strong radial electric ﬁelds.
Only few electrons were trapped and accelerated in the
three-dimensional potential wells [3].

The petawatt (1015 W) CPA lasers of new genera-
tion, which are under construction now [4], are capa-
ble of delivering ultra-short pulses (tens of femtosec-
onds) which can be focused with a relatively large focal

spot (r0 ∼
(I0 > 1018 W/cm2) on axis. In this case, the eﬀective
acceleration distance (two Rayleigh lengths) is naturally
elongated up to about ten centimeters, and the GeV en-
ergy range can be achieved by using the standard LWFA

scheme proposed, the plasma wavelength is smaller than
the wake radial size. The large transverse extent of the
wakeﬁeld structure reduces the detrimental eﬀect of ra-
dial forces on accelerated electrons.

Anticipating this attractive chance to reach the GeV
range of electron energy by using the standard LWFA,
we analyze in this paper theoretically and numerically
the details of laser pulse and wakeﬁeld evolution, and
simulate the acceleration of an electron bunch in a wide
range of parameters typical of those prospective experi-
ments. The simulations have been carried out using the
code WAKE [5, 6]. The laser parameters in the simula-
tions are ﬁxed: the laser wavelength λ0 = 0.8 µm, the
pulse energy 30 J, the pulse duration τL = 30 fs, the
radius of focal spot r0 = 100 µm (hence, the maximum
1018 W/cm2). In the
intensity in vacuum is I0 ≈

gives the period of plasma oscillation τp ≈
330 fs and
100 µm (where
the plasma wavelength λp = 2π/kp ≈
kp = ωp/c). Then, the normalized pulse duration and
width are ωpτL = 0.56 and kpr0 = 6.28, respectively.
The relativistic factor corresponding to the laser group
velocity γg ≡
ω0/ωp = 125. The laser power is exceeds
by a factor of four the critical power for the relativistic
self-focusing Pcr = 16.2(ω0/ωp)2 GW [7].

The paper is organized as follows. Numerical study of
nonlinear eﬀects in propagation of ultra-short petawatt
laser pulse through rareﬁed plasma is given in Sec. II.
The simulations supported by analytical considerations
show that, for the parameters chosen, mutual cancella-
tion of the relativistic and ponderomotive nonlinearities
occurs in the pulse body. Thereby, only for very high in-
tensities and/or electron densities (such that the critical
power Pcr is exceeded by more than a factor of four) the
nonlinearity produces some eﬀect on the pulse shape.

Section III addresses the eﬀect of laser pulse transverse
evolution on the phase velocity of the two-dimensional
(2D) nonlinear wakeﬁeld. In our framework, the eﬀect
originates from the relativistic nonlinearity of the plasma
wake. The amplitude of the wakeﬁeld is proportional to
the laser intensity which grows (drops) while the pulse
focuses (diverges). On the other hand, the relativistic
reduction in frequency is proportional, in the weakly rel-
ativistic approximation, to the wake amplitude squared.
Therefore, as the pulse approaches the focal plane, the
wake period stretches and its phase velocity drops be-
low the pulse group velocity vg = c2k0/ω0. Beyond the
focal plane the wake period shrinks and tends at inﬁn-
ity to the linear limit τp. At this stage, the wake phase
accelerates and can become superluminous (i.e., exceeds
not only the pulse group velocity in plasma but the vac-
uum speed of light). A similar eﬀect was discussed previ-
ously for the case of longitudinally inhomogeneous plas-
mas [8]. Growth of the wake amplitude combined with
the reduction in phase velocity provides conditions for
highly eﬃcient trapping of non-resonant injected elec-
trons, γe0 ≪
γg, in the stage of laser focusing [here and

Wakeﬁeld acceleration of resonant electron bunches is
considered in Sec. IV. Numerical simulations prove that
γp0 (where γp0
the resonant conditions γe0 ≈
is a relativistic factor given by the local phase velocity of
wake at the point of electron injection) are beneﬁcial for
the ultra-short electron bunches only that are loaded di-
rectly in the accelerating and focusing quarter of the wake
period (τp/4
80 fs for the parameters given). Taking
a longer bunch leads to a considerable energy spread be-
cause the resonant electrons injected at the bottom of the
potential well stay there all the time and gain just a lit-
tle energy. Injection of mono-energetic electron bunches
with γe0 = γg = 125 or γe0 = 42 in the second period of

wakeﬁeld gives very similar output: after two Rayleigh
lengths (about eight centimeters) the trapped electrons
possess a broad energy spectrum (about 100% spread)
with maxima at 0.5 GeV (for γe0 = 125) or 0.75 GeV (for
γe0 = 42) and a cutoﬀ at approximately 1 GeV. Tuning
the energy of injected electrons to the resonance with a
given period of wakeﬁeld reduces the ﬁnal rms emittance
of the accelerated electron bunch but has no eﬀect on the
ﬁnal energy spread.

Acceleration of electron bunches injected with energies
far below resonant is discussed in Sec. V. Simulations
show that the electrons with initial energies 5 MeV and
1 MeV are not only eﬀectively trapped and accelerated up
to 1 GeV, but also reveal substantially less energy spread
and lower root-mean-square (rms) emittance than in the
resonant case discussed in Sec. IV. The slow electrons
(γe0 = 0.08γg and γe0 = 0.016γg) loaded near the bot-
tom of the 2D potential well slip into the accelerating
and focusing phase of the wake period and get eﬀectively
accelerated. In particular, acceleration of the 1 MeV elec-
trons along twice the Rayleigh length produces a group
of electrons with the energy 900

Section VI discusses and summarizes the results ob-
tained. In Appendix A the analytical considerations are
given of those nonlinear phenomena which have an eﬀect
on the propagation of ultra-short laser pulses in plas-
mas. The features of the plasma wakeﬁeld generated by
diﬀracting Gaussian short laser beam are considered in
Appendix B.

II. SHORT LASER PULSE PROPAGATION IN
TENUOUS PLASMA: COMPENSATION OF
RELATIVISTIC AND PONDEROMOTIVE
NONLINEARITIES

Relativistic and ponderomotive nonlinearities of a
short (ωpτL < 1) and broad (kpr0 > 1) over-critical
laser pulse (P > Pcr) partly cancel each other [9]. The
vacuum-like propagation of such pulse [10], however, is
not immune to the residual eﬀect of the non-compensated
relativistic nonlinearity (see Appendix A). We simulate
the laser propagation, plasma wakeﬁeld excitation, and
acceleration of injected test electrons by means of the 2D
axially symmetric fully relativistic time-averaged particle
code WAKE [5, 6], which is based on the quasi-static [9]
and extended paraxial [11] approximations. The normal-
ized slowly varying amplitude (envelope) of laser vector
potential a(ξ, r, z) is evaluated as a function of radial
(r) and longitudinal (z) space variables and the retarded
time ξ/c = t
z/c. In the simulation, the pulse prop-
agates from the left to the right through a plasma slab
centered at the vacuum focal plane z = 0. Simulation
starts at a plane z = z0 < 0 and terminates at a symmet-
ric plane z =
. Initial laser beam with the parameters
listed in Introduction is Gaussian [12],

A few simulations with diﬀerent plasma densities
demonstrate the eﬀect of nonlinearities on the pulse evo-
lution. The maximum laser intensity on the axis (r = 0)
is plotted in Fig. 1 versus propagation distance. The den-
3 gives P = Pcr (dashed

sity n0 = nSF = 2.8
line). At n0 = 8nSF (or P = 8Pcr, dotted line), the non-
compensated relativistic self-focusing increases the inten-
sity by a factor of 2.5 in the vicinity of the focal plane.
However, for n0 = 4nSF (or P = 4Pcr), the on-axis laser
intensity varies similarly to the vacuum case (dash-dotted
line in Fig. 1). Therefore, under appropriate choice of
parameters, propagation of a relativistically strong ultra-
short overcritical laser pulse in a rareﬁed plasma is almost
unaﬀected by the relativistic self-focusing, which could be
a challenge for a longer pulse [7].

Figure 2 demonstrates the distortion of the laser radial
and temporal proﬁles due to the decompensation of rel-
ativistic self-focusing. For P
6Pcr, the contour plots
of normalized intensity a2(ξ, r) show that the pulse lead-
ing part spreads in the course of propagation, while the
trailing part shrinks. The eﬀect manifests in full in the
vicinity of the vacuum focal plane. The diﬀerence be-
tween the speed of light in vacuum and the pulse group

The analytical consideration given in a weakly rela-
tivistic approximation in Appendix A predicts an am-
plitude threshold a0c [see Eq. (A11)], below which the
laser pulse radially spreads according to the linear the-
ory of diﬀraction for Gaussian beams [12]. For a Gaus-
sian temporal proﬁle, the critical amplitude reads a0c =
4 ln 2/[1 + (kpr0/4)2]. The laser amplitude
(ωpτL)−
a0 = 1.72 taken in the simulation of Fig. 2 exceeds the
1.11, which explains the obvi-
critical amplitude a0c ≈
ous manifestation of the nonlinearity in Fig. 2. In order
to reduce the adverse eﬀect of decompensated nonlinear-
ities, the wakeﬁeld evolution and electron acceleration
will be further simulated in more rareﬁed plasmas. The
parameters of the case P = 4Pcr will be taken, that is,
3 that gives
the plasma density n0 = 1.12
a0c ≈

amounts to γg = 125, and the normalized pulse duration

NEARLY GAUSSIAN LASER PULSE

mostly compensated and the laser beam close to Gaus-
sian; the parameters are taken as suggested at the end of

section II. Although the laser pulse is much shorter than
a plasma period, the intensity on axis is high enough to
produce in the wake an electron density perturbation of
the order of the background plasma density. The wake
becomes strongly nonlinear in the vicinity of focal plane,
z = 0, where its amplitude is maximal. The radial and
temporal proﬁles of the laser pulse and electron density at
this plane are shown in Fig. 3. The wakeﬁeld is far from
harmonic: the regions of density depression are much
wider than the density humps. Moreover, the wake phase
front is not plane and its curvature builds up with time.
The relativistic shift of plasma frequency in the wake is
proportional, to the lowest order, to the laser intensity
squared, which radially varies and thus brings about the
said curvature [13]. The radial phase variation, however,
does not produce a radial wavebreaking [14] within at
least six wake periods.

The wake phase velocity is not constant along the laser
path. This eﬀect has a purely relativistic origin. As the
pulse focuses at z < 0, its intensity grows, and so does
the relativistic shift of plasma frequency. The wake pe-
riod stretches, and the phase velocity drops below the
group velocity of laser. Beyond the focal plane, z > 0,
the pulse radially spreads, and the plasma period grad-
ually shrinks thus tending back to the linear limit τp.
At this stage, the wake phase velocity may exceed both
laser pulse group velocity in plasma and the speed of light

in vacuum. The luminous point, where the wake phase
reaches the vacuum speed of light, does can exist on the
path of a laser pulse in a longitudinally inhomogeneous
plasma [8]. In our framework, it is due to the nonlinear
frequency variation of plasma wake driven by the diﬀract-
ing laser. Figure 4 shows the on-axis laser intensity (a)
and the electron density (b) versus retarded time and dis-
tance z in plasma. The plot (b) demonstrates the phase
“deceleration” (“acceleration”) at z < 0 (z > 0) with the
wake period stretching (contracting). At z > 0 the wake
phase is superluminous.

An electron falls in resonance with the accelerating
wakeﬁeld if its velocity ve0 coincides at the point of in-
jection with the local phase velocity of wake. Taking
tangents to the electron density crests in Fig. 4(b) helps
to evaluate the resonant Lorentz factor γe0 ≫

Analysis of Figs. 5 and 6 leads to the following conclu-
sion: injection of a quite long (of the order of or longer
than a wake period) resonant electron bunch results in
a large energy spread of trapped and accelerated elec-
trons no matter whether the injected bunch was resonant
with the laser pulse or with a given period of the wake.
It is obvious that the resonant conditions γe0 = γg or
γe0 = γp0 serve well only for the electrons injected in just
one quarter (focusing and accelerating) of the wake pe-
riod. Sample simulation made for a short electron bunch
(11.5

tance gave the mean output 0.85 GeV per electron with
about 30% energy spread.

of using the electrons non-resonant at injection. First,
the accelerated bunch of initially non-resonant particles
is more compact in the radial direction [compare plots (a)
of the two ﬁgures], and the radial momentum spread is
lower [compare plots (b)]. Fig. 7(a) shows no electrons at
the bottom of the potential well, kpξ
10, hence, all the
trapped non-resonant electrons are accelerated, and the
energy gap ﬁnally appears between the trapped and non-
trapped particles [see Fig. 7(c)]. Opposite to the resonant
case, the non-resonant electrons, loaded into either accel-
erating or decelerating focusing phases, gain almost the
same energy. At the point of injection, the wake phase
outruns the non-resonant particles, so they slip out of the
disadvantageous phase towards the focusing and acceler-
ating one. Otherwise, the resonant electrons are initially
at rest in the decelerating phase, and their slippage takes
more time. So, their ﬁnal energy proves to be lower.

accelerated in the second wake period are separated from
the bulk of low energetic particles by a 150 MeV wide gap
[see also Fig. 7(c)]. Besides, eﬃciency of acceleration re-
duces when the time delay between the laser pulse and
electron bunch grows. The spectrum of electrons acceler-
ated in the second period has the maximum at 0.8 GeV
and a sharp cutoﬀ at 0.95 GeV. Acceleration in the sixth
period gives a plateau-like energy spectrum which rises
steadily up to 0.65 GeV and drops at 0.85 GeV. There-
fore, the injection time lag should be taken as small as
possible in order to reduce the adverse eﬀect of the wake
phase velocity variation. As compared with the resonant
case [Fig. 6(b)], ﬁnal emittance of the bunch is typically
lower in the non-resonant case (by a factor of three for
the spectrometer bins beyond 500 MeV).

The transverse size of the beam kpσ = 13.5 is by a factor

rms emittance has a negligible eﬀect on the energy spec-
trum which has a sharp maximum at 0.75 GeV and cut-

(spectrometer bins at E < 500 MeV) is increased due to
nonzero rms emittance of the injected beam. The emit-
tance of the higher-energy electrons is unaﬀected. Thus,
the simulations show that elongating the electron bunch
still preserves all the beneﬁts of using the non-resonant

perimental implementation of the proposed scheme.

VI. CONCLUSION

1

Construction of the petawatt ultra-short-pulse lasers
will create an opportunity for standard LWFA of elec-
trons up to GeV energies.
In quite tenuous plasmas
L ) the relativistic and ponderomotive nonlin-
(ωp < τ −
2π) laser
earities of a not very tightly focused (kpr0 ≥
pulse cancel each other [9]. In this regime, an overcrit-
ical laser pulse propagates like in vacuum.
Increasing
the laser focal spot up to 100 µm in radius elongates the
laser-plasma interaction length (estimated as twice the
Rayleigh length) up to 8 cm without any external opti-
cal guiding. Such not very tightly focused laser pulse,
however, has enough energy to drive a nonlinear plasma
wakeﬁeld along this distance, which provides a control-
lable acceleration of externally injected electrons up to 1
GeV. The nonlinear features of quasi-plane wake plasma
wave facilitate trapping, focusing, and acceleration of the
electrons from the injected bunch. The converging laser
pulse drives the plasma wake whose period stretches (due

to relativistic decrease in plasma frequency) as the pulse
approaches the focal plane. At this stage, the wake phase
velocity drops below the pulse group velocity. Growth
of the wake amplitude combined with the decrease in
the phase velocity provides the eﬃcient trapping of low-
energy (non-resonant) electrons. Beyond the focal plane,
the laser pulse diverges, and the wake phase may become
superluminous, which makes for additional longitudinal
compression of the electron bunch in the focusing and
accelerating quarter of the wakeﬁeld period. These fea-
tures of wakeﬁeld structure reduce the energy spread and
emittance of the electron bunch injected out of resonance
γg(p0), and, in the limit of very low
with the wake, γe0 ≪
initial energy (1 MeV), provide almost monoenergetic ac-
celeration.

In the limit of a short and wide pulse whose length

In this approxima-

as in vacuum [9]. The small corrections to the index of

real solutions for both B < 1 (then δf < 0) and B > 1
(then δf > 0). Reduction of the pulse width in the ﬁrst
case corresponds to the converging laser pulse, while in
the second case the laser diverges. The border of laser
pulse stability against the transverse distortions, B = 1,
gives the implicit equation for the stability point,

(A9)

The point ξc separates diverging and converging parts
in the pulse proﬁle. The function I(ξ) grows monotoni-
cally from the leading front towards the trailing edge of
the pulse. Therefore, the pulse portion which lays be-
tween the leading front and the point ξc spreads, while
the part beyond ξc focuses. As a result,
in the pro-
cess of propagation the short pulse acquires the form
similar to ”beet-root”.
In the vicinity of the thresh-
old point ξc, the pulse width given by Eq. (A8) reads
I(ξc)]/I(ξc).

notations are the same as in Eq. (1). At the initial mo-
ment t = 0, the pulse center ξ = 0 resides at z =
z0.
The pulse propagates towards positive z.

−

In the linear approximation, the frequency of electron
plasma oscillation equals ωp, and the phase velocity vp of
the wake coincides with the group velocity vg of the pulse.
In the weakly nonlinear approximation, the frequency of
plasma oscillations is downshifted because of relativistic
increase of the mass of oscillating electron [19]. The in-
tensity of the Gaussian beam (B1) varies along the laser
path, and so does the amplitude of the plasma wake.
Hence, relativistic reduction of the plasma frequency al-
ters as a function of propagation distance, and this phase
slippage characterizes the variation of the phase velocity
of the wake across the plasma. Consideration of this ef-
1, and not so
fect is easier in the case of a wide, kpr0 ≫
intense, a0 < 1, laser pulse when the wake electric ﬁeld
is the potential one. Then, for the laser pulse amplitude
taken in the form (B1), the dimensionless wake potential

The quantity ξ/vg characterizes a positive time delay

laser pulse position relative to the focal plane. When
the pulse passes the focal plane, ζ becomes positive.
The wake phase velocity coincides with the pulse group
velocity only far away from the focal plane and ex-
actly at the focal plane. The wake phase velocity de-
creases while the pulse approaches the focal plane, and

The electrons are injected at negative ζ where vp < vg.
Hence, the resonance with the nonlinear wakeﬁeld needs
less electron energy (mc2γp0) than the resonance with
the laser pulse (or a linear wakeﬁeld), mc2γg.

Although Eq. (B5) is weakly relativistic, we use it
for a qualitative estimate of resonant gamma-factors for
diﬀerent wake periods for the simulation parameters of
Sec. IV and V (ωpτL = 0.56, a0 = 1.72, kpr0 = 6.3,

INTRODUCTION

The development of the One Atmosphere Uniform
Glow Discharge Plasma (OAUGDPr) has made it possi-
ble to generate purely electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pon-
deromotive (body) forces
[1, 2, 3, 4]. Such forces are
generated without a magnetic ﬁeld and with small in-
In fact, only RF
tensity currents crossing the plasma.
displacement currents produce the body forces that ac-
celerate the plasma. Two methods were devised for ﬂow
acceleration [5, 6]: 1) Peristaltic ﬂow acceleration and
2) Paraelectric ﬂow acceleration. Only the last method
is analyzed in this work. Paraelectric ﬂow acceleration
is the electrostatic analog of paramagnetism: a plasma
is accelerated toward increasing electric ﬁeld gradients,
while dragging the neutral gas with it. Applications span
from propulsion and control systems in aeronautics, to
killing any kind of bacterium and virus (see Ref. [1]).

The role of plasma in aerodynamic research has been
increasing, since it constitutes a signiﬁcant energy mul-
tiplier modifying the local sound speed and thus lead-
ing to modiﬁcations of the ﬂow and pressure distribution
around the vehicle [7, 8, 9]. Plasma actuators have been
shown to act on the airﬂow properties at velocities below
50 m/s [10].

In default of a complete model of a OAUGDPr reac-
tor, Chen [11] built a speciﬁc electrical circuit model
for a parallel-plate and coplanar reactor, modeling it

as a voltage-controlled current source that is switched
on when the applied voltage across the gap exceeds the
breakdown voltage.

Although there is still lacking a detailed characteriza-
tion of such plasma actuators, with only boundary layer
velocity proﬁles measured using a Pitot tube located 1-2
mm above the ﬂat panel
[12] being available, we present
in this paper a self-consistent two-dimensional modeling
of temporal and spatial development of the OAUGDPr
in an ”airlike” gas.

II. NUMERICAL MODEL

A. Assumptions of the model

We intend to describe here the glow discharge regime,
with emphasis on ﬂow control applications of the plasma.
Gadri
[13] has shown that an atmospheric glow dis-
charge is characterized by the same phenomenology as
low-pressure dc glow discharges.

No detailed plasma chemistry with neutral heavy
species is presently available; only the kinetics involving
electrically charged species supposedly playing a deter-
−
minant role at atmospheric pressure: N+

and electrons, is addressed. The electronic rate coeﬃ-
cients and transport parameters are obtained by solving
the homogeneous electron Boltzmann equation under the
hydrodynamic regime assumption [14]. When obtaining
the charged species populations as well the electric ﬁeld
controlling their dynamics, the following electrohydrody-
namics (EHD) eﬀects are studied in this work:

FIG. 1: Schematic representation of electrode geometry of an
energized OAUGDP plasma panel.

The simulation domain is a 2-DIM Cartesian geometry
(see Fig. 1) with total length along the X-axis LX = 0.4
cm and height LY = 0.4 cm; the width of the dielectric
surface along the X-axis is 0.3 cm in Case Study I and
0.1 cm in Case Study II. The dielectric relative permittiv-
ity, supposed to be a ceramic material, is assumed to be
εr = 100; the dielectric thickness is in all cases set 0.065
cm. The capacity of the reactor is determined through
the conventional formula Cds = ε0εrS/d. The electrodes
thickness is supposed to be negligible.

level at p = 1 atm.

The electron homogeneous Boltzmann equation [14] is
solved with the 2-term expansion in spherical harmonics
for a mixture of N2 − 22% O2. The gas temperature is
assumed constant both spatially and in time, Tg = 300
K, and as well the vibrational temperature of nitrogen
Tv(N2) = 2000 K and oxygen Tv(O2) = 2000 K. The
set of cross sections of excitation by electron impact was
taken from [15].

At atmospheric pressure the local equilibrium assump-
tion holds: Transport coeﬃcients (νN2

Dp) depend on space and time (r, t) only through the lo-
cal value of the electric ﬁeld E(r, t). This is the so called
hydrodynamic regime.

The reactions included in the present kinetic model are
listed in Table I. It is assumed that all volume ioniza-
tion is due to electron-impact ionization from the ground
state and the kinetic set consists basically in ionization,
attachment and recombination processes. The kinetics
of excited states and heavy neutral species is not consid-
ered.

To obtain a faster numerical solution of the present
hydrodynamic problem it is assumed that the gas ﬂow
does not alter the plasma characteristics and is much
smaller than the charged particle drift velocity. This as-
sumption allows a simpliﬁed description of the ﬂow. For
more concise notation, we put np2 ≡ [N +

To close the above system of equations we use the drift-

velocities appearing in the continuity equations:

nivi = niµiE − ∇(niDi),

where Vdc is the dc bias voltage (although here we ﬁxed to
ground, Vdc = 0) and ω is the applied angular frequency.
V0 is the maximum amplitude with the root mean square
voltage in this case of study Vrms = 5 kV and the applied
frequency f = 5 kHz.

where µi and Di represent the charged particle mobil-
ity and the respective diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The applied
voltage has a sinusoidal wave form

Auger electrons are assumed to be produced by impact
of positive ions on the cathode with an eﬃciency γ =
5 × 10−2, so that the ﬂux density of secondary electrons
out of the cathode is given by

jse(t) = γjp(t),

(10)

with jp denoting the ﬂux density of positive ions.
In
fact, this mechanism is of fundamental importance on
the working of the OAUGDPr.

Due to the accumulation of electric charges over the di-
electric surface, a kind of ”memory voltage” is developed,
whose expression is given by:

The boundary conditions are the following:

• electrode (Dirichlet boundary condition): V (x, y =

• dielectric (Neumann boundary condition): En =

.

The ﬂux of electric charges impinging on the dielectric
surface builds up a surface charge density σ which was
calculated by balancing the ﬂux to the dielectric

= e(|Γp,n| − |Γe,n|).

(13)

Here, Γp,n and Γe,n represent the normal component of
the ﬂux of positive and negative ions and electrons to the
dielectric surface. Furthermore, it is assumed that ions
and electrons recombine instantaneously on the perfectly
absorbing surface.

The entire set of equations are solved together, at each

time step, self-consistently.

III. METHOD OF RESOLUTION OF FLUID
EQUATIONS

The particle’s governing equations are of convection-
diﬀusion type. They are solved using a method pro-
posed by Patankar [19] (see also Ref. [20]). According
let L(φ, dφ, d2φ, ...) = S be a homo-
to this method,
geneous diﬀerential equation in φ, with a source term
S. Then the procedure of Patankar consists in replacing
L(φ, dφ, d2φ, ...) = S by aP φP =
k akφk + b, where P
is the central point of the mesh.

The chosen time step is limited by the value of the di-
electric relaxation time. For the present calculations the
total number of computational meshes used is (100x100).
This fair condition allows calculating an entire cycle with

of about 30 hours per cycle, limiting to a reasonable value
the relative error |∆we/we|, with we designating the elec-
tron drift velocity. Stationarity was attained typically
after 4-5 cycles. Equations 1- 13 are integrated succes-
sively in time supposing the electric ﬁeld is constant dur-
ing each time step, obtaining a new value of the electric
ﬁeld after the end of each time step. The method used
to integrate the continuity equations and Poisson equa-
tion was assured to be numerically stable, constraining
the time step width to the well known Courant-Levy-
Friedrich stability criterion.

IV. RESULTS

The simulations were done for a two-dimensional ﬂat
staggered geometry, as sketched in Fig. 1. This is essen-
tially a ’surface discharge’ arrangement with asymmetric
electrodes. It is assumed that the plasma is homogeneous
along the OZ axis.

A. Electrical characteristics

In Fig. 2 it is given the evolution along a period of
time of the calculated electric current, applied voltage,
gas voltage and memory voltage. The OAUGDPr, and
as well generically a DBD, occurs in conﬁgurations char-
acterized by a dielectric layer between conducting elec-
trodes. At about 740 Volts, electron avalanches develop,
replenishing the volume above the surface with charged
particles. Hence, the charged particles are ﬂowing to the
dielectric (see Eq. 13) start accumulating on the surface,
and build-up an electric ﬁeld that prevents the occur-
rence of a high current, and quenches the discharge de-

on the order of 103 V/cm. The electric ﬁeld magnitude
is strongest in region around the inner edges of the en-
ergized electrode and dielectric surface (which is playing
during this half-cycle the role of a pseudo-cathode).

During the avalanche development a strong ion sheath
appears. In fact, as the avalanche develops an ion sheath
expands along the dielectric surface until it reaches the
boundary. With the ion sheath travels an electric ﬁeld
wave, with some similarities with a solitary wave. The
speed of its propagation in the conditions of Fig. 3 is
about 150 m/s. See Refs. [9, 21] for very elucidating
explanation of this phenomena.

C. Paraelectric gas ﬂow control

The theory of paraelectric gas ﬂow control was devel-
oped by Roth [1]. The electrostatic ponderomotive force
FE (units N/m3) acting on a plasma with a net charge
density ρ (units C/m3) is given by the electrostatic pon-
deromotive force and can be expressed under the form

plasma, νen is the electron-neutral momentum transfer
frequency and ωp is the plasma frequency. We found
that this force term is negligible, contributing at maxi-
mum with 1 % to the total ponderomotive force. Sub-
sequently, the ponderomotive forces were averaged over
the area of calculation. Comparing the calculated space
averaged ponderomotive forces per unit volume shown in
Figs. 4- 5 it is seen that when the electrode width in-
creases they become one order of magnitude higher. On
average, during the second half-cycle the ponderomotive
force magnitude decreases. This happens when the volt-
age polarity is reversed and the energized electrode play
the role of cathode. This is due to a reduction of the
potential gradient on the edge of the expanding plasma
(see also Ref. [21]). Calculations of EHD ponderomotive
force have shown that its maximum intensity is attained
during electron avalanches, with typical values on the or-
der of 5 × 109 N/m3. F x points along OX (propelling
direction), while F y points downwards (boundary layer
control).

clear the slight decrease of the gas speed during the cath-

ode cycle. This is related to the decrease of ponderomo-
tive forces, as discussed above. As we assumed charged
particles are totally absorbed on the dielectric surface,
the swarm of ions propagating along the dielectric sur-
face are progressively depleted, dwindle with time. How-
ever, it is worth to mentioning (see also Ref. [22]) that
in certain conditions the inverse phenomena can happen,
a bigger dielectric width feeding up the ion swarm with
newborn ions and thus inducing an increase of the gas
speed. How long its width can be increased is a matter
of further study.

V. CONCLUSION

A 2-DIM self-consistent kinetic model has been imple-
mented to describe the electrical and kinetic properties of
the OAUGDPr. It was conﬁrmed that the electric ﬁeld
follows the Aston’s law above the energized electrode.
EHD ponderomotive forces on the order of 5 × 109 N/m3
can be generated locally during the electron avalanches,
their intensity decreasing afterwards to values well below
on the order of 104 ÷ 105 N/m3. On the cathode side the
EHD ponderomotive forces can decrease 1.5 ÷ 2 orders of
magnitude, due probably to a smaller important poten-
tial gradient. The ponderomotive forces (and as well the
gas speed) tend to increase whenever the energized elec-
trode width augments relatively to the dielectric width.
This code will help to design an advanced propulsion
system, achieving ﬂow control in boundary layers and
over airfoils by EHD means, with numerous advantages
over conventional systems.

FIG. 6: Space averaged gas speed as a function of time. The
straight solid line is a linear ﬁt showing the increase of gas
speed with time. Case I

Here, F x is the calculated space average ponderomotive
forces per unit volume, and ρ = 1.293 Kg/m3. Fig. 6
shows the gas speed along the entire cycle in Case I. The
average value of the gas speed is around 15 m/s while the
experimental value, measured with a Pitot tube 1-2 mm
above the surface, is 5 m/s as high as is for nearly the
same operational conditions [12].

As can be seen in Fig. 7 the gas speed increases to
about 20 m/s when the dielectric surface decreases. It is

Nonlinear Radiation Pressure and Stochasticity in Ultraintense Laser Fields

Joel E. Moore
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139

The radiation force on a single electron in an ultraintense plane wave (a = eE/mcω ∼ 1) is
calculated and shown to be proportional to a
in the high-a limit, with a weak dependence on
the wave polarization. The cyclotron motion of an electron in a constant magnetic ﬁeld and an
ultraintense plane wave is numerically found to be quasiperiodic even in the high-a limit if the
magnetic ﬁeld is not too strong, as suggested by previous analytical work. A strong magnetic ﬁeld
causes highly chaotic electron motion and the boundary of the highly chaotic region of parameter
space is determined numerically. Applications to experiments and astrophysics are brieﬂy discussed.

It has been known for many years that qualitative
changes occur in the behavior of an electron moving in
an electromagnetic plane wave when the dimensionless
strength a = eE/mcω is of order unity. Recent ad-
vances in laser pulse compression and ampliﬁcation [1]
have made it possible to attain such ultraintense waves in
the laboratory and led to new investigations of their prop-
erties. One important eﬀect is that an electron moving
in an ultraintense electromagnetic plane wave and also
subjected to slowly varying “background” ﬁelds behaves
approximately like a particle of enhanced mass moving
only in the background ﬁelds. The fast motion in the
wave can be rigorously averaged over if the background
ﬁelds are suﬃciently weak and the plane wave is not so
strong that pair creation eﬀects become signiﬁcant.

This Letter considers what happens to the enhanced-
mass approximation when two eﬀects ignored in its
derivation are included. The ﬁrst eﬀect considered is non-
linear scattering of the incident wave, which is shown to
give rise to a radiation force on the quasiparticle which is
quadratic in the incident power for strong ﬁelds. Because
of the enhanced-mass eﬀect, the resulting acceleration for
strong ﬁelds scales as (power)3/2. This radiation force de-
pends on the polarization of the incident wave (not unex-
pected since the total radiated power is known to depend
on polarization [2]) but this dependence drops out in the
low- and high-ﬁeld limits. The second eﬀect considered
is the destruction of the enhanced-mass behavior as the
strength of the background ﬁelds is increased to violate
1 nec-
the ﬁeld-strength condition eBback/mcωwave ≪
essary for the enhanced-mass derivation. This suggests
that the ﬁeld-strength condition is a real physical limit on
the enhanced-mass description. Both eﬀects are expected
to be signiﬁcant in astrophysical situations, and the ﬁrst
eﬀect may well be visible in laboratory experiments with
ultraintense laser pulses.

Classical calculations are valid for high a as long as

celerators [4]. Lasers used in the National Ignition Facil-

ity and similar inertial fusion projects have a

strong-ﬁeld eﬀects are signiﬁcant, and current experi-
mental tests of strong-ﬁeld QED should see a quantum
analogue of the nonlinear radiation force calculated here.
Many astrophysical problems also involve high-a radia-
tion sources [5].

The classical averaging to ﬁnd the drift motion of the
electron guiding-center in the enhanced-mass regime [6]
gives the same mass enhancement factor γ0 as appears
in the calculation of the Dirac propagator for an elec-
tron dressed by a plane wave [7]. In quantum-mechanical
terms the enhanced mass occurs because the electron has
absorbed a wave photons more than it has radiated, on
average. The resulting oﬀ-mass-shell electron has charge
e and enhanced mass mγ0 = mp1 + e2
/m2c4.

Here A is the vector potential and
denotes averaging
over the wave phase. For a linearly polarized monochro-
matic wave γ0 = p1 + a2/2. The enhanced mass ap-
pears classically because the electron is relativistic over
its fast orbit in the intense plane wave, so its inertia to
other applied forces is increased.

The motion of an electron in a plane wave of arbitrary
intensity is integrable both classically and within the
Dirac equation. This occurs because a third conserved
px exists in addition to the two transverse
quantity γ
generalized momenta. Here γ is the electron Lorentz fac-
tor and px is the component of electron momentum along
the wave axis. Including radiative eﬀects or adding ad-
ditional ﬁelds generally violates this conservation. The
result of the scattering of the wave by the electron is a
force on the electron along the wave axis, which has the
form F = 2e4
/3m2c4 for weak plane waves. In the
i
high-a regime the electron radiates much more strongly
a4 rather than a2 in the low-a limit) and radiates high
(
∝
harmonics of the wave frequency [2]. Some care must be
taken to calculate the radiation force for a strong plane
wave correctly, since the electron can have diﬀerent γ and
hence diﬀerent inertia at diﬀerent times in its motion in
the plane wave.

We consider monochromatic linearly and circularly po-
larized waves as examples and then generalize to poly-
chromatic and arbitrarily polarized incident waves. The
motion in a circularly polarized wave is simple:

tion reaction force from the scattered photons causes the
drift velocity (the velocity of the drift frame) to change
in time. The drift velocity component along the wave
axis changes for an applied force F (in addition to the
force from the wave) according to [6]

The average over phase η can now be carried out–the ﬁrst

It is useful to clarify the diﬀerences between the radi-
ation force and the (longitudinal) ponderomotive force,
which also acts along the axis of the wave. The longi-
tudinal ponderomotive force, observed in recent experi-
ments [8], acts only when the wave’s envelope is rising or
falling, and arises from the conservation of the quantity
γ
px. (There are also transverse ponderomotive forces
in real beams arising from the ﬁnite spot size; these have
a diﬀerent character and are not discussed here.) The net
eﬀect of the ponderomotive force from a laser pulse is a
displacement of the electron in the direction of the pulse
without any change in velocity. The radiation force does
px and always acts in the forward direc-
not conserve γ
tion, unlike the ponderomotive force, which is directed
forward when the wave is rising and backward when the
wave is falling. Treating an electron in a plane wave as
an enhanced-mass particle acted upon by ponderomotive
and radiation forces gives a nearly complete description
of single-particle behavior in the classical regime.

Now we turn to consider the second eﬀect discussed
in the opening: the modiﬁcations to the enhanced-mass
picture when strong constant electromagnetic ﬁelds are
added to the plane wave. In the following the wave will
be taken to have constant amplitude and ponderomotive
and radiation forces will be neglected. For deﬁniteness
consider adding a constant magnetic ﬁeld B = Bˆz to a
linearly polarized wave Ay(ξ) traveling in the ˆx direc-
tion. Then pz is constant and we take pz = 0 so that
the electron motion is conﬁned to the xy plane. This
conﬁguration of ﬁelds was chosen because it is the sim-
plest which shows the wide variety of possible behavior.
For small wave strength aw = eE/mcω the motion can
be analyzed perturbatively because the equations of mo-
tion are nearly linear [9]. Special-relativistic eﬀects act as
small nonlinear perturbations which tend to move elec-
trons away from resonance as their energy varies.

When aw is of order unity, the equations are strongly
nonlinear and new phenomena appear. However, the mo-
tion is still simple for aw > 1 as long as the applied
magnetic ﬁeld is not too strong. In the derivation of the
equations for the motion of the guiding-center, it was
1, i.e.,
necessary to assume ab = eB/mcω = ωc/ω
the electron is far from resonance. Fig. 1 shows a typical
trajectory when the enhanced-mass picture is applicable
(aw = 1.5, ab = 0.02): the electron executes fast oscilla-
tions in the wave, while its guiding-center makes a slow
orbit in the magnetic ﬁeld. In this section we study nu-
merically the breakdown of the enhanced-mass picture

motion resulting from the electron’s relativistic velocity
will be shown to destroy integrability over part of phase
space. This is in contrast to the previously studied inte-
grable motion when the magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the
wave axis [10].

With no wave present the gyrocenter of the electron
px/eB) (with m = c =
motion (x0, y0) = (x + py/eB, y
1) is constant in time. The kinetic energy E = γ is also
conserved. The energy is no longer conserved when the
wave Ay is added because the Hamiltonian is now time-
dependent. Within the linear approximation an unlim-
ited amount of energy can be transferred to the electron
at resonance (ωc = eB/mc = ωwave). The possibility of
resonance makes it somewhat surprising that the elec-
tron still has a well-deﬁned gyrocenter when the wave is
added. This gyrocenter reduces to the normal gyrocenter
when the wave strength is zero and is exactly constant
for an arbitrarily strong wave. Its coordinates are

(5) reduce the eﬀective dimension of phase space by two.
Choosing particular values Kx = Ky = 0 of the constants
corresponds to shifting the gyrocenters of all possible tra-
jectories to the origin, removing two translational degrees
of freedom. After this shift, px and py are no longer in-
dependent coordinates but rather functions of x and y
determined by (5).

The existence of two constants of motion reduces the
eﬀective phase space in this particular case from ﬁve
dimensions to three. Hamiltonian motion in a two-
dimensional phase space is always integrable, so that
three-dimensional motions such as the driven pendulum
and the Chirikov-Taylor problem [11] are the simplest
that can exhibit nonintegrable behavior. The equations

These equations are integrated numerically for various
values of ab, aw, and the initial conditions x(η0), y(η0).

Because the equations of motion (6) are periodic in η,
it is convenient to plot the electron’s (x, y) coordinates
after each period to study the long-time behavior. This
gives an area-preserving map of the plane to itself. Fig. 2
shows a typical surface of section obtained in this way.
For low values of the electron initial energy, the motion is
quasiperiodic and nearly circular, while for large values of
the initial energy the motion is chaotic, as demonstrated
by numerically calculated Liapunov exponents (Fig. 3).
As time increases the largest exponent for trajectories
beginning on points A, B, C is decreasing to zero, while
for points D, E, F the largest exponent remains positive,
indicating that neighboring initial points separate expo-
nentially rapidly [12]. The electron’s initial energy aﬀects
the character of the motion because ab can be much larger
in the rest frame of an electron than in the lab frame if
the electron has a large initial velocity. To eliminate this
eﬀect the initial electron drift velocity is ﬁxed at 0.5c
henceforth.

The enhanced-mass description predicts that

the
guiding-center of
in a circle:
(xgc(t), ygc(t)) = (x0 + (vd/Ω) sin Ωt, y0 + (vd/Ω) cos Ωt),
with vd = 0.5c and Ω = ωc/γ0γd = abω√1
2/γ0.
At the end of each wave period, xgc(t) and ygc(t) are
compared with the actual location of the guiding-center
calculated from (6). As a dimensionless measure of the
error we use the normalized sum of squares error over a
cyclotron orbit:

The error is found to be quite small (Egc < 0.01) for all
values of aw studied as long as ab < 0.04. For each value
of aw, Egc increases rapidly to order unity once ab reaches
a certain critical ﬁeld: as a threshold we deﬁne acrit
(aw)
as the value of ab where Egc = 0.01. Consistent with the
predictions of the enhanced-mass picture, acrit
remains
nonzero for large aw (and in fact increases slightly with
aw). Even though high aw makes the equations (6) quite
nonlinear. the motion remains quasiperiodic and nearly
circular for ab < acrit

As ab increases above acrit

, eventually the trajectory
with initial velocity 0.5c becomes chaotic (has a posi-
tive Liapunov exponent) at some value a∗
b . For large aw,
above a∗
b the motion is strongly chaotic and the electron
energy ﬂuctuates wildly. This diﬀers from nearly linear
resonance at small aw in that no tuning of frequencies is
necessary for energy gain and hence energy gain is not
limited by relativistic detuning. Fig. 4 shows numerical
curves for acrit
b as part of a schematic phase di-
agram. The dotted line (which was not calculated and
is only schematic) separating the quasilinear resonance
phase from the strong stochasticity phase can be deﬁned
by the destruction of the last invariant torus at large en-
ergy, since in three dimensions such a torus bounds the

ously proposed that the stochastic motion of electrons in
multiple plane waves may give rise to high-energy cosmic
rays [13].

We veriﬁed that approximately the same boundary for
the guiding-center description applies when the applied
wave is a superposition of two or three applied frequen-
cies.
It seems natural to conjecture that the guiding-
center region in Fig. 4 also describes waves of ﬁnite band-
width and other orientations of the magnetic ﬁeld (ex-
cluding the integrable case B

k).

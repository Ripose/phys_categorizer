The suppression of the bremsstrahlung cross section due to multiple scattering of the emitting
electrons is an important eﬀect in dense media (Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal eﬀect). Here, we
study the emission from a dense, fully-ionized and non-relativistic hydrogen plasma. Using the
dielectric approach, we relate optical properties such as emission and absorption to equilibrium
force-force correlation functions, which allow for a systematic perturbative treatment with the help
of thermodynamic Green functions. By considering self-energy and vertex corrections, medium
modiﬁcations such as multiple scattering of the emitting electrons are taken into account. Results
are presented for the absorption coeﬃcient as a function of the frequency at various densities. It
is shown that the modiﬁcation of the inverse bremsstrahlung due to medium eﬀects becomes more
signiﬁcant in the low frequency and high density region.

1. INTRODUCTION

In a fully ionized plasma, bremsstrahlung and inverse bremsstrahlung are the only emission and absorption pro-
cesses, respectively. For partially ionized plasmas these processes contribute to some extent to the continuous emis-
sion/absorption spectrum. We introduce the emission coeﬃcient j(ω) as the rate of radiated energy per unit volume,
frequency and solid angle, and the absorption coeﬃcient α(ω) as the relative attenuation of the intensity of electro-
magnetic waves propagating in the medium per unit length. For a thermally equilibrated plasma, these quantities are
linked by Kirchhoﬀ’s law [1]

results in the well known Bethe-Heitler cross section [3, 4].

In the low frequency limit, the Bethe-Heitler cross section behaves roughly like 1/ω. Within QED, this infrared-
divergence is discussed as a consequence of the neglect of vertex corrections [5]. The infrared-divergent terms can be
shown to cancel with corresponding contributions to the form factor of the source particle which is a manifestation
of the Ward-Takahashi identities [6].

This Born approximation can be improved by taking Coulomb wave functions for the initial and ﬁnal states. In
this case, an analytic result for the absorption coeﬃcient was given by Sommerfeld [7]. Due to the occurrence of
hyper-geometric functions, simpler approximations such as the Born-Elwert approximation [8] have been developed.
In the classical limit, the Sommerfeld expression reduces to a result obtained by Kramers earlier [9].

In a dense plasma, the inﬂuence of the collective behavior of the system and the modiﬁcation of single-particle
properties of the emitting and absorbing particles as well as the bremsstrahlung photons are important. Retaining
the single-scattering picture of Eq. (4), medium eﬀects can be taken into account e.g. by a modiﬁcation of the potential.
Instead of a Coulomb potential, a static or dynamically screened potential should be used [10]. A quantum-statistical
approach based on a systematic perturbative treatment of the force-force correlation function has been developed in
Ref. [11], for an application to inverse bremsstrahlung see Ref. [12].

How does multiple scattering of the emitting electron change the cross section? This question was ﬁrst treated by
Landau and Pomeranchuk [13] in a semi-classical way and soon afterwards by Migdal [14] using quantum statistical
methods. They showed that the account of successive collisions leads to a suppression of the bremsstrahlung cross
section compared to the Bethe-Heitler result at photon energies low against the energy of the scattering electron.
Both Bethe-Heitler and Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) theory give the same result in the limiting cases of high
photon energies and/or low densities, i.e., in those cases where the Born approximation is applicable. Migdal’s result
has been rederived more recently using diﬀerent methods, e.g., path-integral calculations [15, 16] and quantum kinetic
equations [17]. A comprehensive overview of theoretical approaches is given in [18]. There, it is also pointed out
that the LPM eﬀect might play an important rˆole for the emission/absorption spectrum of a plasma even in the
non-relativistic regime due to the large number of free charge carriers. Other aspects of the emission of radiation are
also under consideration such as a coherent state description of photon emission [19, 20].

Due to the large energies required to observe notable eﬀects, it took quite a long time until experiments could
unambiguously approve LPM theory. Experimental investigations have been performed since the late 1950’s using
high energy electrons (some MeV to GeV) from cosmic rays [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] and accelerators [26]. These early
experiments suﬀered from poor statistics and were unable to conﬁrm LPM theory. More recent experiments at SLAC
[27] and CERN [28, 29, 30] have indeed shown the LPM eﬀect.

Migdal’s theory is not completely microscopic but relies on the deﬁnition of a macroscopic parameter, namely the
coherence length l, initially introduced by Ter-Mikaelyan [18] and ﬁrst applied to the theory of bremsstrahlung by
Landau and Pomeranchuk [13]. The coherence length gives the scale of photon energy, below which the suppression of
bremsstrahlung becomes important. It is basically determined by the density of the medium. Knoll and Voskresensky
[31] were the ﬁrst to treat the question of the LPM eﬀect in the context of a many particle system, where every
constituent has to be regarded as an emitter of bremsstrahlung. They were able to show a suppression of the
emission/absorption spectrum at low frequencies by using medium modiﬁed single particle propagators. The particles
are assigned a ﬁnite lifetime τ , given by the width of their spectral function Γ = ~/τ . However, this quantity is not
calculated from a microscopic approach, but simply set as a parameter. It is related to the aforementioned coherence
length by the simple relation τ

l/c [32].

In this work, we present a completely microscopic calculation of the absorption spectrum, where the spectral
function of the electron is obtained in a self consistent manner. Thus, we present for the ﬁrst time a fully microscopic

≃

treatment of the LPM eﬀect for a many-particle system. The absorption coeﬃcient is deﬁned in linear response
theory and is expressed through thermodynamical correlation functions using a diagram technique equivalent to the
well known Feynman diagrams [33]. Medium eﬀects are accounted for systematically in terms of self-energy and
vertex corrections. We show that the Bethe-Heitler bremsstrahlung spectrum follows from this approach in lowest
order perturbation theory using free particle propagators. The account of coherent successive scattering, as in LPM
theory, can be achieved by a partial summation of self-energy diagrams. This procedure leads to a ﬁnite width of the
single-particle spectral function which reﬂects the modiﬁcation of the energy-momentum dispersion relation due to
the medium. It is found that the absorption coeﬃcient calculated on the basis of these medium modiﬁed propagators
is signiﬁcantly altered in the low frequency range in comparison to the Born approximation. In the high frequency
limit as well as in the low density limit, the Born approximation is reproduced. Thus, the main features of LPM
theory can be rederived within our microscopic approach.

2. LINEAR RESPONSE THEORY

We consider the interaction of soft photons with a non-relativistic, homogeneous plasma. A key quantity to describe
the propagation of electro-magnetic waves in a medium is the dielectric tensor ǫij (k, ω) [34]. In the isotropic case, the
tensor can be decomposed into a transverse ǫt(k, ω) and a longitudinal ǫl(k, ω) part with respect to the wave vector
k. Here and in the following, we take k to point along the z-axis, k = kez. In the long-wavelength limit k
0, the
longitudinal and the transverse part coincide ǫ(ω) = limk→0 ǫl(k, ω) = limk→0 ǫt(k, ω). The absorption coeﬃcient can
be obtained from the dielectric function according to

→

where the index of refraction n(ω) is also linked to the dielectric function by

The relation between ǫl(k, ω) and the longitudinal response function χl(k, ω)

allows for a microscopic approach to the dielectric function. Within linear response theory, the Kubo formula relates
the response function to the current-current correlation function [35]

where the collision frequency is given in the form of a force-force correlation function, cf. Ref. [11]. Thus, the
absorption coeﬃcient is directly proportional to the real part of the force-force correlation function, which itself can
be determined using perturbation theory.

As well known, the deviation of the diﬀraction index n(ω) from unity at frequencies near the plasma frequency ωpl is
responsible for the so-called dielectric suppression of the bremsstrahlung spectrum. We refer to the pioneering work of
Ter-Mikaelyan [36]. In our approach, making use of Eqs. (8), (15), and (16), the index of refraction can be determined
from the force-force correlation function. However, due to the choice of the frequency range in consideration (ω
ωpl),
this eﬀect will not be considered in the present work. We will focus only on the medium eﬀects obtained directly from
the evaluation of the force-force correlation function.

k = ~2k2/2mc. The spin is not given explicitly but is included into the free-particle quantum number c. Due
and Ec
to conservation of total momentum of electrons, only electron-ion collisions contribute to Eq.(23). With Eq.(23), we
identify the Green function as a four particle Green function. Its diagrammatic representation is shown in FIG. 1,
l.h.s. Here, G4 denotes a four-particle Green function that contains all interactions between the considered particles
[12]. We perform a sequence of approximations by selecting certain diagrams contributing to G4. Considering the
electron-ion interaction determining the force ˙J z
in Born approximation, but the full
correlations within the electron and ion subsystem, respectively, we are led to the middle of FIG. 1 (b) showing only
those diagrams which can be factorized into two polarization bubbles. Πe denotes the electronic polarization function,
Πi is the corresponding ionic quantity. In this way, we keep the description of the single scattering event on the level
of the Born approximation. However, higher order interactions between the full electron and ion subsystem such
as a ladder approximation (t-matrix) are ignored, cf. also Ref. [11]. The t-matrix corrections and in particular the
reproduction of the Sommerfeld result [7] have been studied in Ref. [12].

A. Born approximation

As a simple example and prerequisite for further improvements, we consider the Born approximation. In this case,
G4 is a product of four single particle propagators and all single particle propagators are replaced by free propagators.
We obtain for the Green function the diagram given in FIG. 1, r.h.s. Details of the calculation are discussed in App.

It is instructive to study the diﬀerent terms in Eq.(28) in more detail: The integrand contains the distribution function
(Maxwell distribution). Furthermore, a logarithm that depends on both electron and photon energy appears. Taken
with appropriate prefactors, this logarithm is equal to the diﬀerential cross section for inverse bremsstrahlung in the
non-relativistic limit (Bethe-Heitler formula) [34]. Thus, we have a quite reasonable relation between the absorption
coeﬃcient as a macroscopic property and the underlying microscopic process, namely inverse bremsstrahlung. The
absorption spectrum is obtained through integration of the cross section of the microscopic process weighted with the
distribution function of the absorbing particles.
The absorption coeﬃcient in Born approximation suﬀers the same logarithmic divergence in the limit ω
divergence) as the non-relativistic limit of the Bethe-Heitler formula.
We will now show how the Born approximation can be improved. As already mentioned above, improvements based on
a more sophisticated description of the single scattering process via a t-matrix approach have been obtained recently
[12]. Eﬀects due to dynamical screening have also been considered. Both eﬀects remove the infrared divergence
mentioned before. In this work, we want to include medium eﬀects such as the successive scattering of the absorbing
particles on ions during the absorption of the photon, a process becoming more important with increasing density.
This is also the basic idea of the LPM eﬀect.

The correction in lowest order to Born which takes account of medium eﬀects in the propagator can be achieved
by performing either one self-energy insertion or one vertex correction in the sense of Ward-Takahashi identities. In

We use i+ to indicate loops with ionic propagators. The ﬁrst loop on the r.h.s. yields the Born result as shown
previously, in the following we have the self-energy and the vertex correction, respectively.
However, one does not obtain a ﬁnite result from this ansatz in the case of the self-energy correction. Instead, a
partial summation of all self-energy terms leading to a spectral function is necessary. The results are presented in
subsection 3.C. In constrast, the last diagram of Eq. (29) describing the vertex correction gives a ﬁnite contribution as
shown in subsection 3.D. A full self-consistent treatment of the vertex, i.e. solving the corresponding Bethe-Salpeter
equation [33], has not yet been performed.

We now discuss the inﬂuence of multiple scattering of the source particles (electrons) on ions. This can be accounted
for by using dressed propagators in the calculation of the force-force correlation function, i.e. by replacing the free
electron Green function by the expression

For the self-energy, we describe the scattering of the electron on an ion by a statically screened ion potential, cf.
Eq.(26).
The Hartree term vanishes due to charge neutrality. The Fock term of the electron self-energy is not relevant, since
we assume a non degenerate system. The self-consistent ﬁrst loop correction to the Hartree-Fock self-energy due to
the electron-ion interaction is given by the diagram

Σe(p, zν) =

This approximation can be improved by taking into account a partial summation of further loops,
the GW approximation for the self-energy [35].

Eq. (33) can be solved numerically by iteration starting from a suitable initialization. From the form of the screened
potential Eq. (26), we note that the main contribution to the integral in Eq. (33) arises from terms with small
momentum q. Therefore, we will discuss an approximation where the argument p + q in the self-energy is replaced by
Σe(p, ~ω) on the r.h.s. This ansatz is justiﬁed as can be seen in FIG. 2, where we show the full
p, i.e. Σe(p + q, ~ω)
solution of Eq. (33) and the approximative solution for the set of parameters ne = 10−6 a−3
B and kBT = 2 Ry = 27.2 eV.
After dropping the shift of the momentum variable in the self-energy, the q integral can be performed analytically.

C. Eﬀects of the electron self-energy

The Born approximation can be improved accounting for self-energy and vertex corrections, see Eq. (29). However,
the contribution of the two diagrams containing the self-energy is diverging so that we performed partial summations
of higher orders, leading to the Dyson equation and the spectral function discussed above.
In this way, the free
electron propagator is replaced by the full electron propagator when calculating the force-force correlation function.
This approximation exactly reﬂects the point made by Migdal and Landau/Pomeranchuk to account for a ﬁnite
life-time (damping rate) of electron states propagating in a dense medium.

The force-force Green function is obtained from the evaluation of the following diagram:

where the integrals over the angular parts have been performed.

The further evaluation requires an expression for the spectral function. Note, that in the limit of free particles,
where the spectral function is given by a δ-function, the Born approximation, Eq. (25), is recovered. We will use the
result obtained above within our approximation for the self-energy.

The result is shown in FIG. 4. The correction factor αΣ(ω)/αB(ω) (cf. Eq.(22)) is plotted as a function of the
frequency for three diﬀerent approximations with the parameters ne = 10−6 a−3
B and kBT = 27.2 eV. The full line
presents the result of the self-consistent treatment, Eq. (34), and is compared to a calculation with free propagators
in the self-energy diagrams, see Eq. (29), and a calculation using a Lorentzian ansatz of the spectral function with
a width taken at the on-shell energy Γ(p, ~ω = Ee
p). This corresponds to the introduction of a ﬁnite life-time in the
approach of Knoll and Voskresensky [31].

For the lowest frequencies considered here, all approximations show a suppression of the absorption coeﬃcient as
compared to the Born result. At high frequencies, all curves tend towards unity, i.e., the Born result is recovered. For
intermediate frequencies, an enhancement of up to 35 % is found for the calculation using free propagators. Making
use of the self consistency, the enhancement is reduced to 6 % at most. For the Lorentzian ansatz, no enhancement
at all appears. Thus, the width of the imaginary part of the self-energy as a function of frequency ω (FIG. 3) plays a
crucial rˆole for the size of the enhancement. We expect that any increase in the width of the self-energy will further
decrease the enhancement or even lead to a suppression for all frequencies as in the case of the Lorentzian ansatz,
which corresponds to an inﬁnite width of the imaginary part of the self-energy. A further broadening could result
from an extension to higher orders in the set of diagrams for the self-consistent calculation of the spectral function,
e.g. by inclusion of vertex terms.

D. Vertex corrections

As known from the Ward-Takahashi identities, self-energy and vertex corrections are intrinsically related. In partic-
ular, if medium corrections arise in a certain order of a small parameter like the density from the self-energy, also
contributions from the vertex corrections are expected in the same order. This well-known fact is used to construct
so-called conserved approximations [39, 40] and has also been discussed in the context of other medium eﬀects, such
as the modiﬁcation of two-particle states or the inclusion of bound states into the polarization function and the

12

(44)

(45)

calculation of optical line spectra proﬁles [41]. Thus, it is necessary to study the vertex corrections corresponding to
the self-energy considered before. However, the solution of the vertex-equation is a technically very challenging task
and has been solved so far only in certain approximations [42, 43]. In lowest order, the vertex correction is obtained
through insertion of one ion-loop inside the electron-loop:

taken in lowest order in κ. For the details, see App. B. This expression can be evaluated numerically. In the limit
of high frequencies, where the second integral becomes negligible compared to the ﬁrst, the absorption coeﬃcient is
proportional to K1(ω)/ω4. Since the K1 function has the same asymptotic behavior as the K0 function, which was
the characteristic of the Born result for the absorption coeﬃcient Eq. (6), the ratio αV/αB (cf. Eq. (22)) behaves like
1/ω in the high frequency limit. The relative change of the absorption coeﬃcient due to the vertex correction αV/αB
is shown in FIG. 5. For all frequencies considered, a suppression with respect to the Born approximation is found.
For the considered energy range, the corrections are small and decrease with increasing energy. For energies larger
ω−1 arises. The corrections are small for low densities compared
than 1 Ry, the expected high frequency behavior
to higher densities.

∝

We consider the absorption coeﬃcient α(ω) including all of the improvements. Since the Born approximation is

already included in the self-energy contribution αΣ(ω) we have

α(ω) = αV(ω) + αΣ(ω)

.

(46)

The relative change α(ω)/αB(ω) is presented in FIG. 6. For the sake of comparison, the self-energy correction is shown
as well. For small frequencies, the self-energy contribution and the vertex contribution add to a net suppression. For
higher energies, the self-energy term shows an enhancement, which is partially compensated by the vertex. However,
the net result is still an enhancement. In the high frequency limit, the Born result is reproduced.

Our approach, namely the microscopic treatment of the dynamical self-energy, extends a recent work of Knoll and
Voskresensky [31], where a Lorentzian ansatz for the spectral function with a frequency-independent quasi-particle
lifetime was considered. The Lorentzian ansatz for the spectral function was discussed above in subsection 3.C.,
taking the imaginary part of the self-energy at the quasi-particle energy. Then, a suppression of the bremsstrahlung
spectrum was observed. In general, the microscopical treatment leads a frequency-dependent imaginary part of the
self-energy, and, according to the Kramers-Kronig relation, to a non-vanishing real part. In particular, the inclusion
of the real part of the self-energy in the spectral function inﬂuences the medium modiﬁcation of the bremsstrahlung
spectrum.

In the present paper, the one-loop approximation was taken for the self-energy. It has been shown that a self-
consistent treatment has to be used in order to avoid unphysical artifacts which arise, if instead of the full propagator
the free propagator is taken to evaluate the self-energy. This is already known from the treatment of the spectral
functions in plasma physics in the so-called GW approximation [35] where the interaction with the medium is imple-
mented by a screened potential. It should be mentioned that in this case a self-consistent treatment of the spectral
function on the level of the GW approximation has been performed [44]. Any iterative solution starting from the free
propagator leads to non-physical structures in the spectral function, see also [45].

Within our approach, we found a switch from a suppression at low frequencies to an enhancement at high frequen-
cies for the bremsstrahlung spectrum. The approximation for the self-energy can be improved by considering further
diagrams. In particular, the vertex correction would be of interest which modiﬁes the coupling to the interaction
potential. The inclusion of vertex corrections is also necessary to obtain conserved approximations and has been
In conclu-
shown in Subsection 3.D., where a further suppression of the bremsstrahlung spectrum was observed.

sion, the modiﬁcation of the bremsstrahlung spectrum by the surrounding medium is sensitively dependent on the
approximation used.

We cannot elaborate further on the switch from suppression to enhancement seen in the self-energy correction. In
order to verify the existence of such a switch, higher order calculations are necessary. A consistent procedure would
consist in a) using the full propagator in the calculation of the vertex correction, b) solving the full vertex equation
with full propagators and ﬁnally c) solve the Dyson equation for the single particle propagator with the solution of
the vertex equation.

The importance of vertex corrections in the self consistency relations has also been shown in the description
of the spectral function of the homogeneous electron gas. There, notable diﬀerences between a so-called GWΓ
approximation [42] including vertex terms and a GW approximation [46] arise. It should be mentioned that self-
consistent Schwinger-Dyson equations for the self-energy have been considered in ﬁeld theory [47] to ﬁnd solutions for
the QCD running coupling problem. A corresponding treatment would lead to a better description of the modiﬁcation
of the bremsstrahlung spectrum in a dense medium, but would exceed the frame of the present work. Also, at low
frequencies, further eﬀects such as the dielectric suppression are of importance. It has not been considered in this
approach, but can easily be obtained from the force-force correlation function as well.

Rigorously, one would have to perform another expansion into partial fractions in order to obtain the imaginary part
of this Green function. This procedure would lead to delta functions of the form δ(Ee
p+q) without a bosonic
frequency of the external ﬁeld in the argument. These are residues of a perturbation expansion of the wave functions
of the electron in the ion’s potential and do not yield any information about the dynamics of the system. Thus, only
those denominators in Eq.(B3) are of interest, that do contain the frequency ωµ. It suﬃces to perform an expansion
into partial fractions with respect to ωµ. We obtain

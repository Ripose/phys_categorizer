Abstract

Low frequency longitudinal wave instability in magnetized high correlation

dusty plasmas is investigated. The dust charging relaxation is taken into

account.

It is found that the instablity of wave is determined signiﬁcantly

by the frequency of wave, the dust charging relaxation, the shear viscosity

and viscoelastic relaxation time, the coupling parameter of high correlation

of dust as well the strength of magnetic ﬁeld.

Low frequency longitudinal volume dust waves have been extensively studied for weakly

coupled and unmagnetized dusty plasmas [1–5]. Recently the corresponding research on

Nos. 10275007 and No.10135010, and partially by the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program

of Higher Education (No 20010027005) and the Distinguished Young Teacher Fund of Ministry of

dust waves have been also extended to the strongly coupled [6–9] as well the magnetized

dusty plasmas [10–13].

In this letter we study the instability of longitudinal dust wave

in the strongly coupled dusty plasmas. The stationary external magnetic ﬁeld is applied.

Some important factors such as the high-correlation on dusts, the wave-number dependence

of the elastic relaxation time and eﬀect of dust charging relaxation are included.

It is

shown that there are some frequency regime for the occurence of longitudinal dust wave

instability because of magnetized eﬀect and the charging collisions between the dusts and

the plasma particles. The regime of wavenumber that longitudinal wave is allowed depend

also on the competition between shear viscosity and applied magnetic ﬁeld strength. The

behaviors of dust wave instability is also modiﬁed signiﬁcantly in magnetized dusty plasmas

by magnetized eﬀect.

The applied external magnetic ﬁeld is assumed along z-direction as B =Bz. Because we

consider the longitudinal waves, we just need one of the Maxwell equations, i.e. Poisson

the overall charge neutrality condition holds in the steady state, ni0 = ne0 + Zd0nd0. For

longitudinal modes, one has to assumes that the wave propagates nearly perpendicular

to the magnetic ﬁeld. For simplicity we shall consider wave along x. The perturbations

associated with the problem are assumed as in the form of

exp[i(kx

equation. On the other hand in terms of a generalized viscoelastic hydrodynamic model [14]

the perturbed density for the dusts in magnetized plasmas are also obtained. In addition

to the dust charging equation by orbit-motion-limited (OML) theory the problem would

be closed by Eq.(1). In Ref. [13] we have obtained the general dispersion relation for low

In summary, we have investigated the low frequency longitudinal wave instability in

strongly coupled dusty plasmas in presence of magnetized ﬁeld. The eﬀect of dust charging

relaxation is taken into accoun.

It is found that the occurence of instability of wave is

determined signiﬁcantly by the frequency of perturbation wave, the dust charging relaxation,

the shear viscosity and viscoelastic relaxation time, the coupling parameter of high-correlated

dusts as well the strength of magnetic ﬁeld.

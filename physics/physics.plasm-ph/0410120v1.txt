Abstract.
In this report, we discuss whether the optimal electric ﬁeld to promote the
growth of armchair- type nanotubes (metallic character) evaluated using the previous
H¨uckel-Poisson method can be applied at the tip of a nanotube in a realistic system.
Setting the cross-section of a nanotube and the external ﬁeld by the sheath, we estimate
an eﬀective area at the sheath edge. Since the electric charge distribution in a nanotube
caused by the external electric ﬁeld was determined in our previous study, we obtained
the electric ﬁeld distribution out of a nanotube by solving the Poisson equation and
clariﬁed the structure of the electric ﬁeld lines. By determining the eﬀective area,
we show the optimal interval of the catalyst metal, which is necessary to selectively
grow the metallic nanotubes. When nanotubes grow thickly during the initial stage of
growth, a strong electric ﬁeld cannot be applied to the tips of the tubes. As a tube
grows and the tube length increases, we found that the optimal electric ﬁeld decreased.
To maintain the chemical activity at the tip, the sheath electric ﬁeld must be decreased.
We estimated the decreasing rate of the sheath ﬁeld to the tube length.

1. Introduction

It is known that SWCNT (single-walled carbon nanotube) has the characteristics of
a metal or semiconductor according to the chiral angle[1]. However, the production
method controlling the chiral angle has not been established. The method of controlling
the chiral angle by the electric ﬁeld and selectively producing an armchair type (metallic
character) was then investigated in our previous study[2]. The electronic states of
the π electrons are described by the H¨uckel method and their electric interactions
are self-consistently taken into account through the Poisson equation. The frontier
electron density at both ends of the nanotubes with open-ends was evaluated[3, 4, 5, 6].
The electric ﬁeld intensity to promote the growth of the armchair-type nanotube was
found. The optimal intensity of a direct current electric ﬁeld to eﬃciently make metallic
nanotubes is approximately 1V/nm[2].

In this study, we examined whether the imposition of this optimal electric ﬁeld on
nanotubes through a sheath electric ﬁeld is possible, and evaluated the interval required
to grow a long nanotube. To selectively produce a long nanotube by the electric ﬁeld,
it is clear that the restriction arises at the interval of the tubes on a substrate. This

is because an eﬀective electric ﬁeld will not be applied at the tip of a nanotube if the
interval of the nanotubes is too narrow. Using the electric charge distribution of a
nanotube from our previous result, and solving the distribution of the electric ﬁeld out
of a nanotube, we estimated the interval of nanotubes required to actually apply the
optimal electric ﬁeld evaluated in our previous study.

In section 2, we present the calculation assumptions and some comments. The
results are given in section 3. The interval R and the electric ﬁeld lines are shown. In
section 4, the relation between the electric charge induced by the external ﬁeld and the
tube length is shown. We discuss the dependence of the sheath electric ﬁeld on the tube
length with the change in the induced charge. We summarize this study in section 5.

2. Settings and calculation of electric ﬁeld

We assumed a single-walled nanotube (SWNT) and a constant sheath electric ﬁeld. We
approximate the electric charge distribution of a nanotube by the distribution of the
multi-rings. The axial electric charge distribution is given by our previous results using
the H¨uckel-Poisson method[2]. We approximate the electric ﬁeld distribution out of the
nanotube formed by multi-rings with the electric charge by the Legendre function.

If a sheath electric ﬁeld completely concentrates at the tip of a nanotube, the
relation of the electric ﬁeld and the surface area can be estimated to be E0S0 = E1S1
based on Gauss’s law. Here, E0 denotes the sheath electric ﬁeld, S0 denotes the area
at the sheath edge, E1 denotes the electric ﬁeld at the tip of a nanotube, and S1
denotes the cross section of a nanotube. However, because the charge induced in the
nanotube inﬂuences the ﬁeld lines and the electric ﬁeld opposite to the sheath ﬁeld
occurs, E0S0 = E1S1 is not valid when the tube length is short as compared to the sheath
length. When an electric charge distribution of a nanotube is given, we can calculate
the area S0 at a sheath edge. If S0 is found, the interval of the metal catalyst patterned
on a substrate is able to be theoretically estimated. That is, optimal numbers per unit
area of nanotubes which can be eﬀectively grown is found. Moreover, the dependence
of S0 on the nanotube length is evaluated. This is because the electric ﬁeld on a tip of
a tube changes with the tube length. We use the following notations and parameters as
shown in table 1. Figure 1 shows the outline of the electric ﬁeld lines out of a nanotube.
We set the origin of the coordinate (r,θ,φ) to the center of a nanotube, as shown
in ﬁgure 1. From the symmetry of a tube, the electric ﬁeld depends only on r and θ.
We express the position of the ith-ring in the z direction as li. The electric potential
caused by the charge in the ith-ring is approximated by the Legendre function using the
following equation,

The total potential φ is summed to φi using the following equation,

We calculate the electric ﬁeld lines and examine whether the electric ﬁeld lines
at the sheath edge arrive at the tip of a nanotube. We deﬁne R = L tan θ0, then R
denotes the distance at the sheath edge from the nanotube axis as shown in ﬁgure 1.
We examine R, by changing the tube length or the charge density in the nanotube. We
set the initial condition at the sheath edge and calculate the following equation.

3. Results

First, we show the result for two rings, as shown in ﬁgure 2. Then, m denotes the
averaged π electron number per ring and the symbol M is deﬁned by me
4πǫ0 . We dropped
the ith suﬃx. The radius a is set to 1 nm and m is 2.3. The sheath electric ﬁeld E0
is set to 0.01 V/nm. The change of the distance R with the change in the length l is
shown in table 2. As tube length l increases, R increases. However, R is not signiﬁcantly
changed.

Given the electric charge distribution as shown in ﬁgure 3, we calculated the electric
ﬁeld distribution for multi-rings. The 42 rings are used. In this case, when l = 4.5 nm,
R is found to be 24 nm. We show the electric ﬁeld line in ﬁgure 4. In the case of multi-
rings, the curvature of the electric ﬁeld line is smooth as compared with the two-ring

Selective production of metallic carbon nanotubes

case. This is because the complex electric ﬁeld opposite to the sheath electric ﬁeld is
caused by each ring charge.

4. Discussion

The area S0 through the electric ﬁeld lines at a sheath edge is also dependent on the
charge induced by the external ﬁeld. We set the area to S0(Q, l), where Q expresses
the electric charge induced on the tube. According to Gauss’s law, we assume Q = αE,
where α denotes the proportional constant related to the polarization. From the results
of the H¨uckel-Poisson method, we found that the optimal electric ﬁeld depends on
the tube length as shown in table 3. These results will be discussed elsewhere. In this
report, to simplify the interpretation, we assume E∗l = ∆φ =constant, where E∗ denotes
the optimal electric ﬁeld to selectively grow the armchair type. We approximated the
relation between the multi-ring charge and the two ring charge as follows.

Q = Qs = αE∗ = c

α
l

,

(14)

where c denotes the constant, Qs denotes the induced total charge summed in the axial
ρdz. In the two-ring calculation, Q is regarded as the charge me in the
direction, i.e.
previous section.

R

Under the condition of equation (14), we changed the π electron number m
corresponding to the induced charge Q and examined the dependence of the interval R
on the length l. First, we set m = 2.3 and l = 4.5 nm. Changing m and l under the
condition ml =constant, we obtain the dependence of R on l, as shown in table 4. The
interval R is not strongly dependent on l and it weakly decreases. Using the conserving
law E0S0 = E∗S1, where S0 = πR2(l), we obtain E0(l) = cS1/(lS0(l)), as shown in
ﬁgure 5. From the result of ﬁgure 5, as the nanotube grows, fortunately, it is found that
we should decrease E0 in order to maintain the optimal ﬁeld at the tip. By considering
that R is not strongly dependent on l, E0 is approximated by an inverse proportion to
the length l.

5. Summary

The structure of the electric ﬁeld line out of a nanotube was clariﬁed. We found that
the potential diﬀerence ∆φ that gives the optimal electric ﬁeld to grow the armchair-
type nanotube is constant for the tube length. The minimum interval R to apply the
optimal electric ﬁeld at the tip was estimated. During the initial stage of the growth
of the nanotube, a strong electric ﬁeld is necessary. As a nanotube grows, the optimal
electric ﬁeld decreases. By controlling the sheath electric ﬁeld versus time, it is possible
to continue to apply the optimal electric ﬁeld on the nanotube.

Recently, observations from laboratory experiments have revealed amplitude modulation of
whistlers by low-frequency perturbations. We here present theoretical and simulation studies of
amplitude modulated whistler solitary waves (whistlerons) and their interaction with background
low-frequency density perturbations created by the whistler ponderomotive force. We derive a non-
linear a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation which governs the evolution of whistlers in the presence of
ﬁnite-amplitude density perturbations, and a set of equations for arbitrary large amplitude density
perturbations in the presence of the whistler ponderomotive force. The governing equations stud-
ied analytically in the small amplitude limit, and are solved numerically to show the existence of
large scale density perturbations that are self-consistently created by localized whistlerons. Our
numerical results are in good agreement with recent experimental results where the the formation
of modulated whistlers and solitary whister waves were formed.

INTRODUCTION

II. DERIVATION OF THE GOVERNING
EQUATIONS

Almost three decades ago, Stenzel [1] experimentally
demonstrated the creation of a magnetic ﬁeld-aligned
density cavities by the ponderomotive force of localized
electron whistlers. Observations from a recent labora-
tory experiment [2] exhibit the creation of modulated
whistler wavepackets due to nonlinear eﬀects. Further-
more, instruments on board the CLUSTER spacecraft
have been observing broadband intense electromagnetic
waves, correlated density ﬂuctuations and solitary waves
near the Earth’s plasmapause, magnetopause and fore-
shock [3], revealing signatures of whistler turbulence in
the presence of density depletions and enhancements.
The Freja satellite [4] also observed the formation of enve-
lope whistler solitary waves correlated with density cav-
ities in the plasma.

A theoretical investigation has in the past predicted
the self-channeling of electron whistlers and the creation
of a localized density hump [5]. Taking into account the
spatio-temporal dependent whistler ponderomotive force
[6, 7], investigations of the modulation and ﬁlamenta-
tion of ﬁnite amplitude whistlers interacting with mag-
netosonic waves [8, 9, 10] and ion-acoustic perturbations
[11, 12] have been carried out.

In this article, we investigate nonlinearly interacting
electron whistlers and arbitrary large amplitude ion-
acoustic perturbations, by using computer simulations,
and we ﬁnd analytical expressions for whistlerons in the
low-amplitude limit [13, 14].

A. Dimensionless variables

In order to investigate numerically the interaction be-
tween whistlers and large amplitude ion-acoustic per-
turbations, it is convenient to normalize the governing
equations into dimensionless units, so that relevant pa-
rameters can be chosen. We introduce the dimension-
less variables ξ = ωpi,0z/Cs, where the sound speed
is Cs = [(Te + 3Ti)/mi]1/2, τ = ωpi,0t, N = n/n0,
u = vz/Cs and
4πn0(Te + 3Ti); the only free di-
mensionless parameters of the system are Ωc = ωce/ωpi,0,
κ = k0c/ωpe,0, η = Ti/Te and Vg = vg/Cs. The normal-
ized system of equations are of the form

that our nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation for the whistler
ﬁeld is based on a Taylor expansion of the dispersion rela-
tion for whistler waves around a wavenumber k0. Thus,
this model is only accurate for wave envelopes moving
with speeds close to the group speed Vg, and other speeds
of the wave envelopes may give unphysical results. Here,

The latter corresponds to whistlers with a wavelength
of 2.4 cm. Furthermore, the whistler group velocity is
106 m/s. The argon ion-electron plasma
vg = 3.36
(mi/me = 73400) had the temperatures of Te = 10 eV
103 m/s,
and Ti = 0.5 eV, giving the sound speed 5.25
and the normalized group velocity Vg = vg/Cs = 640.
In Fig. 1, we have illustrated localized whistler envelope
solitons, in which the electric ﬁeld envelope (left panels)
is accompanied with a density hump (right panels). We
notice that the density hump is relatively small, due to
the large (in comparison with the acoustic speed) group
velocity of the whistler waves. In Fig. 2, we can see the
development of a large-amplitude whistler pulse, which
has been launched in a plasma perturbed by ion-acoustic
waves, with a density modulation of one percent (see
the caption of Fig. 2). This simulates, to some extent,
the experiment by Kostrov et al., where the density and
magnetic ﬁeld were perturbed by a low-frequency con-
ical refraction wave, giving rise to a modulation of the
electron whistlers. Here, as in the experiment, we ob-
serve that a modulated electron whistler pulse (middle
panel of Fig. 2) develops into isolated solitary electron
whistler waves (lower panel). We note that the wave-

V. DISCUSSION

We have presented theoretical and simulation studies
of nonlinearly interacting electron whistlers and arbitrary
large amplitude ion-acoustic perturbations in a magne-
tized plasma. For this purpose, we have derived a set
of equations which describe the spatio-temporal evolu-
tion of a modulated whistler packet in the present of
slowly varying plasma density perturbations. The pon-
deromotive force of the latter, in turn, modiﬁes the lo-

cal plasma density in a self-consistent manner. Numer-
ical solutions of the governing nonlinear equations re-
veal that subsonic envelope whistler solitons are char-
acterized by a bell- shaped whistler electric ﬁelds that
are trapped in self-created density cavity. This happens
when the whistler wave frequency is smaller than ωce/4,
where the waves have positive group dispersion. When
the whistler wave frequency is larger than ωce/4, one en-
counters negative group dispersive whistlers and the su-
personic whistler envelope solitons are characterized by
a bell-shaped whistler electric ﬁelds which create a den-
sity hump. Modulated whistler wavepackets have indeed
been observed in a laboratory experiment [2] as well as
near the plasmapause [3] and in the auroral zone [4]. Our
results are in excellent agreement with the experimental

5

results [2], while we think that a multi-dimensional study,
including channelling of whistler waves in density ducts,
is required to interpret the observations by Cluster and
Freja satellites.

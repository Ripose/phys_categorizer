A self-consistent determination of the spectral function and the self-energy of electrons in a
hot and dense plasma is reported. The self-energy is determined within the approximation of the
screened potential. It is shown, that the quasi-particle concept is not an adequate concept for hot
and dense plasmas, since the width of the spectral function has to be considered. As an example,
the solar core plasma is discussed. An eﬀective quasi-particle picture is introduced and results for
the solar core plasma as well as for ICF plasmas are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

Dense plasmas are intensively studied both in experimental as well as theoretical physics. Typical plasmas of this
kind can be found in astrophysical objects like the interior of the sun and the giant planets. On earth, very dense
and hot plasmas are investigated in the context of inertial conﬁnement fusion. Furthermore, the electron gas in
some metals and semiconductors represents a dense and cold plasma. Form the study of dense plasmas, important
information about microscopic mechanisms like the interplay between collective eﬀects and collisions can be gained.
The consistent description of this interplay is a very challenging task.

In a dense plasma, the propagation of a single-particle excitation is a collective phenomenon which is characterized
by the single-particle spectral function. The spectral function for the specie a is given as the discontinuity of the
single-particle Green’s function at real frequencies

In contrast to the quasi-particle picture, where the spectral function is assumed to be proportional to the δ-function,

Aa(p, ω) = i¯h (Ga(p, ω + i0)

.

in dense plasmas the broadening of the spectral function is of great importance, since it describes the ﬁnite life time
of the excitations in the plasma. Here Ea(p) denotes the quasi-particle energy deﬁned below. The spectral function
has a number of interesting properties, which are connected to the thermodynamical properties of the plasma. First
of all, there is a frequency sum rule

As a consequence, the spectral function gives the probability to ﬁnd a certain frequency at a given momentum p.
Furthermore, the density of states is related to the spectral function by

where fa denotes the Fermi distribution function. For a system with a given density na, this relation can be used to
ﬁx the corresponding chemical potential µa. Additional thermodynamic properties can be derived, e.g. the equation
of state can be found. Therefore, the equation of state can be improved taking into account many-particle eﬀects via
an appropriate spectral function.

The spectral function for dense systems has been determined in the context of nuclear physics as well as solid state
physics. In nuclear physics [1], the spectral function of nuclear matter has been studied extensively. It has been shown
that the spectral function exhibits a complex energy dependence, which cannot incorporated in a simple quasi-particle

picture. Eﬀects of higher order correlations like the pairing instability on the spectral function have been found. The
inﬂuence of these pairing eﬀects are reduced if the broadening of the spectral function increases.

In solid state physics, extensive studies of the spectral function have been carried out within the Hubbard-model [2]
and the t-J model [3]. Thermally broadened quasi-particles have been found at high temperatures. Zimmermann et al.
[4] performed a expansion with respect to the width of the spectral function to get a so called extended quasi-particle
picture, but its use is limited to small deviations from the quasi-particle regime. A calculation similar to the one
reported here, has been carried out by Barth and Holm [5]. They applied their calculation to the electron gas at
zero temperature. In solid state physics the spectral function can be measured using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy.

where higher order correlations are hidden in the two particle Green’s function Gab. The numbers label the position

This relation shows, that the imaginary part of the self-energy plays the role of a width of the spectral function while
the real part acts as the shift of the free dispersion relation. Diﬀerent approximations for the self-energy apply for
diﬀerent systems taking into account diﬀerent collective mechanisms. For high density systems interacting via the
Coulomb potential, Hedin [6] proposed the so called GW approximation where polarization eﬀects are considered. In
nuclear matter, particle-particle correlations are the leading mechanisms as was pointed out by Galitski [7]. Therefore,
a T-matrix approximation of the self-energy has to be used. A consistent determination of the spectral function using
this approximation for the self-energy was performed by Alm et al. [1].

Within the GW approximation, the correlated part of the self-energy is determined by

III. SELF-CONSISTENT DETERMINATION OF THE SPECTRAL FUNCTION WITHIN THE GW
APPROXIMATION

A. Results for the spectral function

Using the RPA expression as an input, the spectral function can be determined by solving the set of equations (8)
and (9) iteratively until stability is reached. To start the iteration, one can use a quasi-particle picture or a lorentzian
approximation of the spectral function with a certain width. This width can be used to accelerate the convergence
of the iteration method. The self-consistently determined spectral function is given in ﬁgure 1 for the solar core
106 K and the density
plasma. In accordance with solar models [9], the temperature is assumed to be T⊙ = 15.6
n = 156 g/cm3. The plasma consists of three components, electrons, protons and alpha-particles, with a hydrogen
mass fraction of 33%. The spectral function is shown as a function of the frequency for a ﬁxed momentum. The
spectral function is fairly broad, its width is about a ﬁfth of the thermal energy. Since the function is asymmetric,
the deﬁnition of a width and a shift is to a certain extend ambiguous. The deﬁnition of an eﬀective quasi-particle
description will be proposed in section III B. An undamped quasi-particle is by no means an adequate description
of the spectral function. Therefore, the calculation of thermodynamical properties should be based on the spectral
function calculated here, instead of a quasi-particle approach. In ﬁgure 2, a contour plot of the spectral function as a
function of the energy and the momentum is shown. The plot shows that the situation discussed above applies also
to higher momenta. It has been found that the above given sum rules are fulﬁlled within the numerical accuracy.

×

In ﬁgure 3, the self-consistently determined energy is shown as a function of the frequency along with the quasi-
particle self-energy. As found earlier [10,11] the quasi-particle self-energy shows a logarithmic singularity at the
plasmon energy. Due to the additional integration in the deﬁnition of the self-energy the self-consistent one does not
exhibit a singularity anymore. This corresponds to results reported by Alm et al. [1], where the spectral function and
the self-energy are calculated self-consistently for nuclear matter. Since the forces in nuclear matter are short-ranged,
the important feature discussed there is the formation of bound states. This issue is of lower relevance for the high
temperatures considered here.

B. Eﬀective quasi-particle picture

For the sake of comparison, we deﬁne an eﬀective quasi-particle by ﬁtting the self-consistently determined spectral

function to a lorentzian shape. This can be achieved by solving the dispersion relation

¯h2 p2
2 me −

−

ΣF

e (p) = Σcorr

(p, ω)

.

(15)

Here, ΣF
e denotes the Fock shift. The solution ω0 of this equation can be regarded as the quasi-particle energy.
∆(p)eﬀ = Re Σ(p, ω0) and Γeﬀ(p) = Im Σ(p, ω0) are interpreted as the shift and the width of a ﬁnite lifetime quasi-
particle. However, a lorentzian ﬁt is only a crude approximation to the self-consistent spectral function, e.g. the

3

thermal average of the eﬀective quasi-particle shift is not exactly the Debye shift κ e2/2 contrary to the quasi-particle
result [8]. A comparison of the eﬀective quasi-particle shift and the quasi-particle self-energy based on a free dispersion
is given in ﬁgure 4. Note, that the steep decrease of the quasi-particle self-energy at small momenta is not found in
the eﬀective shift, while the high momentum behaviour is almost identical. Therefore, the shift is overestimated in a
simple quasi-particle picture using a free dispersion relation. Solving the self-consistency relation of the quasi-particle
picture (11), a shift corresponding to the one reported here was found by Fehr et al. [11].

Using the eﬀective shift and width deﬁned above, the temperature and density dependence of the spectral function
can be studied. The results are shown in ﬁgure 5. The width is given as a function of the density for diﬀerent
temperatures. At small as well as at high densities, the width decreases, showing a restoration of the quasi-particle
picture. The maximum in between is shifted to higher densities with increasing temperature. Furthermore, comparing
diﬀerent temperatures at a ﬁxed density, a strong temperature dependence is observed. This implies, that thermal
collisions are the driving mechanism behind the broadening a the spectral function.

C. Implications for thermodynamical properties

In a ﬁrst step, the implications for the electron chemical potential due to the improved determination of the spectral
function will be examined. This has important consequences for the so called Salpeter correction [13] to thermonuclear
reaction rates. Using the self-consistent spectral function the chemical potential for the solar core plasma is determined
from equation (5) to be -146.5 Ryd, whereas the chemical potential of an ideal electron gas would be -142.9 Ryd. Using
a quasi-particle approximation it is -146.3 Ryd, showing that the broadening of the spectral function has little inﬂuence
on the chemical potential. Using the Salpeter correction, i.e considering a Debye-shift only, the chemical potential
results in -146.2 Ryd. Therefore, on the level of single particle corrections, the reaction rates can be excellently
described by the Salpeter expression. Nevertheless, the dynamics also enter in two-particle corrections, which will be
considered in a forthcoming paper [17]. Besides the chemical potential, the eﬀects on the equation of state can be
studied.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The self-consistent determination of the spectral function within the screened potential approximation is reported.
For the solar core plasma, the self-consistent spectral function is found to be fairly broad. The quasi-particle picture
is not an adequate description of the solar core plasma. Therefore, the calculation of thermodynamic properties of the
solar core plasma should be based on the spectral function given above. A lorentzian approximation of the spectral
function is deﬁned introducing an eﬀective shift and width. This can be interpreted as a damped quasi-particle
description. It has been found, that a quasi-particle description overestimates the self-energy at small momenta to a
large extend. Furthermore, the self-consistently determined energy does not exhibit a logarithmic singularity at the
plasmon energy contrary to the quasi-particle one.

It has been pointed out, that the scheme given above is not completely self-consistent, since the Green’s function
in the RPA bubble is not iterated. However, a complete iteration [16] shows that the dielectric function does not
obey exactly known properties like sum rules. This is due to the fact, that besides self-energy corrections also
vertex corrections are to be included. Within the Green’s function method, Baym and Kadanoﬀ [15] developed a
technique to construct the vertex correction in a way to fulﬁll the Ward identities. In this approach the sum rules are
automatically obeyed. Unfortunately, the integral equation connected with the vertex corrections is very involved.
An alternative approach, starting from the Zubarev formalism of the non-equilibrium statistical operator has been
developed, where correlations and collisions are incorporated on the same footing [14]. A compensation of self-energy
and vertex corrections to a large extend has been found, justifying the use of the original RPA expression.

Langmuir modes are the collective oscillations of bulk
particles, with slowly varying complex amplitudes in an
envelope representation ; their interaction with tail par-
ticles is described by a self-consistent set of hamiltonian
equations [5]. These equations already provided an eﬃ-
cient basis [6] for investigating the cold beam plasma in-
stability and exploring the nonlinear regime of the bump-
on-tail instability [7]. Analytically, they were used to give
an intuitive and rigorous derivation of spontaneous emis-
sion and Landau damping of Langmuir waves [8]. Be-
sides, as it eliminates the rapid plasma oscillation scale
ω−1
p , this self-consistent model oﬀers a genuine tool to
investigate long-time dynamics.

As we follow the motion of each particle, we can also
address the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite number of particles in
the long run. This question is discarded in the kinetic
Vlasov-Poisson description, for which the ﬁnite-N cor-
rection is the Balescu-Lenard equation [9] formally de-
rived from the accumulation of weak binary collisions,
with small change of particle momenta. It implies a dif-
fusion of momenta, driving the plasma towards equilib-
rium. However, when wave-particle coupling is domi-
nant, the Balescu-Lenard equation is not a straightfor-
ward approach to ﬁnite-N eﬀects on the wave evolution.
Here we investigate direct ﬁnite-N eﬀects on the self-
consistent wave-particle dynamics. It is proved [10] that
the kinetic limit N
commutes with evolution over
arbitrary times. As one might argue that ﬁnite N be
analogous to numerical discretisation in solving kinetic
equations, we also integrate the kinetic system with a
‘noise-free’ semi-lagrangian solver [11]. In this Letter we
compare ﬁnite grid eﬀects of the kinetic solver and gran-
ular aspects of the N -particles system, whose evolution
is computed with a symplectic scheme [7].

We discuss the case of one wave interacting with the
particles. Though a broad spectrum of unstable waves is
generally excited when tail particles form a warm beam,
the single-wave situation can be realized experimentally
[12] and allows to leave aside the diﬃcult problem of
mode coupling mediated by resonant particles [13].

Eﬀects induced by the ﬁnite number N of particles on the
evolution of a monochromatic electrostatic perturbation in a
collisionless plasma are investigated. For growth as well as
damping of a single wave, discrete particle numerical simula-
tions show a N -dependent long time behavior which diﬀers
from the numerical errors incurred by vlasovian approaches
and follows from the pulsating separatrix crossing dynamics
of individual particles.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is tempting to expect that kinetic equations and
their numerical simulation provide a fair description of
the time evolution of systems with long-range or ‘global’
interactions. A typical, fundamental example is oﬀered
by wave-particle interactions, which play a central role
in plasmas. In this Letter we test this opinion explicitly.
Collisionless plasma dynamics is dominated by collec-
tive processes. Langmuir waves and their familiar Lan-
dau damping and growth [1] are a good example of these
processes, with many applications, e.g. plasma heating
in fusion devices and laser-plasma interactions. For sim-
plicity we focus on the one-dimensional electrostatic case,
traditionally described by the (kinetic) coupled set of
Vlasov-Poisson equations [2,3]. The current debate on
the long-time evolution of this system shows that further
insight in this fundamental process is still needed [4].

The driving process (induced by the binary Coulomb
interaction between particles) is the interaction of the
electrostatic waves in the plasma with the particles at
nearly resonant velocities, which one analyses canonically
by partitioning the plasma in bulk and tail particles.

For initial data approaching a smooth function f as

, the solutions of (3)-(4) converge to those of
the Vlasov-wave system over any ﬁnite time interval [10].
This kinetic model is integrated numerically by a semi-
lagrangian solver, covering (x, p) space with a rectangular
mesh : the function f (interpolated by cubic splines) is
transported along the characteristic lines of the kinetic
equation, i.e. along trajectories of the original particles
[11].

Let us ﬁrst study linear instabilities. One solution of
(3)-(4) corresponds to vanishing ﬁeld V0 = 0, with par-
ticles evenly distributed on a ﬁnite set of beams with
given velocities. Small perturbations of this solution have
δV = δV0eγt, with rate γ solving [8]

γL = πf ′(0) > 0. Negative slope leads to the lin-

ear Landau damping paradox : the observed decay rate
γL = πf ′(0) < 0 is not associated to genuine eigenvalues,
but to phase mixing of eigenmodes [8,17,18], as a direct
consequence of the hamiltonian nature of the dynamics.
Now, this linear analysis generally fails to give the large
time behavior. This is obvious for the unstable case as
non-linear eﬀects are no longer negligible when the wave
intensity grows so that the trapping frequency ωb(t) =

We used the monokinetic case as a testbed [18,19].
Finite-N simulations show that the unstable solution

tially monokinetic particles have been scattered rather
uniformly over the chaotic domain, in and around the
pulsating resonance, while others form a trapped bunch
inside this resonance (away from the separatrix) [19].
This dynamics is quite well described by eﬀective hamil-
tonians with few degrees of freedom [18,20].

In this Letter, we discuss the large time behavior of the
warm beam case, with f ′(p0)
= 0 at the wave nominal
velocity p0 = 0. Fig. 1 displays three distribution func-
tions (in dimensionless form) with similar velocity width :
(i) a function (CD) giving the same decay rate for all

6
phase velocities, (ii) a function (CG) giving a constant
growth rate for all phase velocities [7], (iii) a truncated
Lorentzian (TL) with positive slope f ′(0) > 0.

III. DAMPING CASE

For the damping case, the linear description introduces
time secularities which ultimately may break linear the-
ory down : the ultimate evolution is intrinsically nonlin-
ear, not only if the initial ﬁeld amplitude is large, as in
O’Neil’s seminal picture [2], but also if one considers the
evolution over time scales of the order of the trapping
time (which is large for small initial wave amplitude).
The question of the plasma wave long-time fate is thus
far from trivial [4]. Though some simulations [21] infer
that nonlinear waves eventually approach a Bernstein-
Greene-Kruskal steady state [22] instead of Landau van-
ishing ﬁeld, the answer should rather strongly depend on
initial conditions. Our N -particle, 1-wave system is the
simplest model to test these ideas.

N −1/2 at equilibrium in the limit N

A thermodynamical analysis [17] predicts that, for a
warm beam and small enough initial wave amplitude,
. Fig. 2

shows the evolution of a small amplitude wave launched
in the beam. The N -particle system (line N) and the
kinetic system (line V) initially damp the wave exponen-
tially as predicted by perturbation theory [8], for a time

→ ∞

After that phase-mixing time, trapping induces non-
linear evolution and both systems evolve diﬀerently. For
the N -particle system, the wave grows to a thermal level
that scales as N −1/2, corresponding to a balance be-
tween damping and spontaneous emission [8,17]. For
the kinetic system, initial Landau damping is followed
by slowly damped trapping oscillations around a mean
value which also decays to zero, at a rate decreasing for
reﬁned mesh size. Fig. 2 reveals that ﬁnite-N and kinetic
behaviors can considerably diverge as spontaneous emis-
sion is taken into account. The time τN after which the
ﬁnite-N eﬀects force this divergence is found to diverge

IV. UNSTABLE CASE

Now consider an unstable warm beam (f ′(0) > 0).
Line N1 (resp. N2) of Fig. 3 displays ln(ωb(t)/γr) versus
time for (3)-(4) with a CG distribution with N = 128000
(resp. 512000) and γr = 0.08. Line V1 (resp. V2) shows
ln(ωb(t)/γr) versus γrt for the kinetic system and the
same initial distribution with a 32

grid in (x, p) space. All four lines exhibit the same initial
exponential growth of linear theory with less than 1% er-
ror on the growth rate. Saturation occurs for ωb/γr

[3]. Lines N1 and V1 do not superpose beyond the ﬁrst

trapping oscillation after saturation. Note that, in our
system, oscillating saturation does not excite sideband
Langmuir waves as our hamiltonian incorporates only a
single wave, not a spectrum.

After the ﬁrst trapping oscillation, kinetic simulations
exhibit a second growth at a rate controlled by mesh size.
Line V2 suggests that a kinetic approach would predict
a level close to the trapping saturation level on a time
scale awarded by reasonable integration time. This level
is fairly below the equilibrium Vth predicted by a gibbsian
approach [17] ; such pathological relaxation properties
in the N
limit seem common to mean-ﬁeld long-
range models [23]. Both kinetic simulations also exhibit
a strong damping of trapping oscillations, which disap-
pear after a few oscillations, whereas ﬁnite-N simulations
show persistent trapping oscillations.

→ ∞

One could expect that ﬁnite-N eﬀects would mainly
damp these oscillations, so that the wave amplitude
reaches a plateau. Actually, we observe persistent os-
cillations for all N , and the wave amplitude slowly grows
further, whereas the velocity distribution function ﬂat-
tens over wider intervals of velocity.

This spreading of particles is due to separatrix cross-
ings, i.e. successive trapping and detrapping by the wave
[19].
Indeed, when the wave amplitude grows (during
its pulsation), it captures particles with nearby veloc-
; the
ity, i.e. with a relative velocity ∆vin
trapped particles start bouncing in the wave potential
well. When the wave amplitude decreases, particles are
released, but if they experienced only half a bouncing
period, they are released with a relative velocity (with
respect to the wave) opposite to their initial one, i.e.
∆vout
∆vin. Now notice that a particle which has
just been trapped would oscillate at a longer period than
the nominal bouncing period (namely the one deep in
the potential). Moreover, if the recently trapped particle
had just adiabatic motion in the well, it would have to
recross the separatrix when the resonance would enclose
the same area as at its trapping [24]. Thus one expects
the particle to be unable to complete a full bounce, and
the fraction of particles for which ∆vout
∆vin is sig-
niﬁcant.

≈ −

During this particle spreading process in (x, p) space,
the wave pulsation is maintained by the bunch of parti-
cles which were initially trapped, and are deep enough in
the potential well to remain trapped over a whole bounc-
ing period. These particles form a macroparticle, as is
best seen in the case of a cold beam [20]. Note that, over
long times, the macroparticle must slowly spread in the
wave resonance, following two processes. One acts if the
trapped particle motion is regular : the trapped motions
are anisochronous, i.e. have diﬀerent periods (only the
harmonic oscillator has isochronous oscillations). The
other one works if the motion is chaotic : nearby trajec-
tories diverge due to chaos. Both processes contribute to
the smoothing of the particle distribution for long times,

3

but over much longer times than those over which we
follow the system evolution and observe the wave modu-
lation.

This second growth after the ﬁrst trapping saturation
depends on the shape of the initial distribution function.
In Fig. 3(b), line N2 is the same as in Fig. 3(a), com-
puted over a longer duration, and line N3 corresponds to
N = 64000 with the TL distribution of Fig. 1. Although
N3 corresponds to 8 times fewer particles than N2, the
ﬁnal level reached at the end of the simulation is lower.
In the second growth, particles are transported further
in velocity, so that the plateau in f (p) broadens with
time. As the wave grows, it can trap particles with ini-
tial velocity further away from its phase velocity. Since
1.06 and
the TL distribution reaches its maximum at v
decreases signiﬁcantly beyond this velocity (while CG is
still growing for larger v), fewer particles (with TL than
with CG) can give momentum to the wave when being
trapped (P is conserved) ; hence the second growth is
slower for the TL distribution.

≈

We followed the evolution of the wave amplitude for N3
up to γrt = 1750 : starting from the ﬁrst trapping sat-
uration level (0.4Vth), ﬂuctuations persist with a growth
rate that slowly decreases as we reach 0.78Vth at the end
of the computation. Line N4 of Fig. 3 corresponds to the
TL distribution with 2048000 particles and shows persis-
tent oscillations with approximately the same amplitude
as for N = 64000.

V. CONCLUSION

These observations clearly indicate that the kinetic
models are an idealization and do not contain all the
intricate behavior of a discrete particles system. Now,
we must also admit that the kinetic simulation schemes
do not exactly reproduce the analytic implications of the
kinetic equation. It is then legitimate to ask whether the
numerical implementation of the kinetic equations repro-
duce the diﬀerence between the ﬁnite-N dynamics and
the kinetic theory.

A basic property of the collisionless kinetic equation is
that it transports the distribution function f (x, p) along
the particle trajectories (or characteristic lines in (x, p)
space). As long as the kinetic calculation of f is accu-
rate, one expects the kinetic scheme to follow closely the
N -particle dynamics too. However, the kinetic scheme
is bound to depart from the analytic predictions of the
kinetic equation, because the (chaotic or anisochronous)
separation of particle trajectories implies that constant-
f contours eventually evolve into complex, interleaved
shapes. This ﬁlamentation is smoothed by numerical par-
tial diﬀerential equation integrators, while N -body dy-
namics follows the particles more realistically, sustaining
the trapping oscillations. Hence both types of dynamics

will depart from each other when ﬁlamentation reaches
scales below the semi-lagrangian kinetic code grid mesh.
The onset of ﬁlamentation is easily evidenced in kinetic
simulations. Indeed, whereas the kinetic equation analyt-
ically preserves the 2-entropy
f )f dxdp, numerical
schemes increase entropy signiﬁcantly when constant-f
contours form ﬁlaments in (x, p)-space [25]. As this is
also the time at which trapping oscillations are found to
damp in our simulations, it appears that vlasovian sim-
ulations must be considered with caution from that time
on – and it turns out that it is also the time from which
the second growth starts.

In summary, discussing the basic propagation of a sin-
gle electrostatic wave in a warm plasma, we presented
ﬁnite-N eﬀects which do not merely result from nu-
merical errors and elude a kinetic simulation approach.
Their understanding depends crucially on the dynamics
in phase space. The sensitive dependence of microscopic
evolution to the ﬁne structure of the initial particle dis-
tribution in phase space [18] implies that the interplay
between limits t
requires some cau-
tion. Somewhat paradoxically, reﬁning the grid for the
Vlasov simulations does not solve this problem.

The driving process in the system evolution is sepa-

the system dynamics. Further work in this direction [26]
will also shed new light on the foundations of common
approximations, such as replacing original dynamics (1)-
(2) by coupled stochastic equations, in which particles
undergo noisy transport.

ing intensity-phase variables (I, θ) for the wave, with
ζ = √Ie−iθ. The total momentum P =
l pl + I is
P
a linear function of the wave intensity and of the par-
ticle momenta, while the energy reads H =
2N −1/2

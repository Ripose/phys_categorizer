ABSTRACT

The Green’s function for rf-driven currents in a
toroidal plasma is calculated in the long mean-free-
path limit.

INTRODUCTION

The “adjoint” technique provides an elegant
method for computing the current driven in a
plasma by externally injected radio-frequency
waves. This technique involves using the self-
adjoint property of the linearized collision oper-
ator to express the current in terms of a Green’s
function, where the Green’s function is propor-
tional to the perturbed distribution in the presence
of an electric ﬁeld. This technique was ﬁrst ap-
plied by Hirshman1 for the case of neutral-beam
driven currents in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld.
The effect of the trapped particles found in toroidal
conﬁnement systems was included by Taguchi.2
The application of this technique to rf-driven cur-
rents was made by Antonsen and Chu,3 Taguchi,4
and Antonsen and Hui.5 Approximations to the
Green’s function have been given by a number of
authors.5–10

In this paper, we solve the adjoint problem nu-
merically in toroidal geometry using the collision
operator for a relativistic plasma.11–13 The per-
tinent approximations are: the device is assumed
to be axisymmetric; the mean-free-path is assumed
to be long compared to the device (the “banana
limit”); drifts of the electrons away from the ini-
tial ﬂux surface are neglected; in addition the ex-
pansion of the collision operator in Legendre har-
monics is truncated after the P1(cos θ) term. By
posing the problem in terms of a Green’s function,
we are, of course, also assuming that the plasma is
close enough to equilibrium for the collision oper-
ator to be linearized, and that the wave-driven ﬂux
is known.

est order, a function of the collisionless constants
of motion. We choose to express the distribution in
terms of the “midplane” coordinates14 (u0, θ0), the
magnitude and direction with respect to the mag-
netic ﬁeld of the momentum per unit mass (hence-
forth called just the momentum) at the position
where the magnetic ﬁeld is minimum. Measuring
position on the ﬂux surface by the length l along
the ﬁeld line from this point, the momentum (u, θ)
at an arbitrary position is

u = u0,

sin2 θ = b sin2 θ0,

where b = B(l)/B(0). Particles with sin2 θ0 >
sin2 θtr = 1/bmax are trapped; other particles are
passing. Assuming that the rf is sufﬁciently weak,
the distribution satisﬁes

in momentum space expressed in midplane coordi-
nates. This is related to the local rf-induced ﬂux S

We should also include a term in eq. (1) which
reﬂects the slow heating of the background elec-
trons.3 However, this term does not contribute to
the current carried by f .

where Duu and Fu are the coefﬁcients of energy
diffusion and drag due to electron-electron colli-
sions, and Dθθ is the pitch-angle scattering coefﬁ-
cient due to collisions with both electrons and ions.
These are given by one-dimensional integrals over
a Maxwellian distribution.13

Let us now turn to the second term in eq. (8).
Since χ is odd in uk, we can expand χ(u, θ, l) in
terms of spherical harmonics as follows:

χ(u, θ, l) =

χk(u, l)Pk(cos θ),

χ(u, θ, l)Pk(cos θ)

where Pk is the Legendre polynomial of degree k

and χk(u, l) = (2k+1)

sin θ dθ. The linearized collision operator is a
R
spherically symmetric, so that its angular eigen-
functions are spherical harmonics. This allows us
to write the term Ce/e(fm, χk(u, l)Pk(cos θ))/fm
as
Pk(cos θ)Ik(χk(u, l)), where Ik is a lin-
ear integral operator. Transforming to midplane co-
ordinates, we ﬁnd

the order of 0.05√ǫ where ǫ is the inverse aspect

tive ion charge state Z.

We consider current drive by waves which are
Landau damped. We assume that the rays pierce
the ﬂux surface at a single poloidal angle φ′ where
b = b′, and that the wave does not alter the
slope of the electron distribution appreciably. In
this case, we have S

b′ sin2 θ0. The current drive efﬁciency can be cal-
culated by inserting this form for S0 into eqs. (3)
and (7) and performing the integrals numerically.
The resulting efﬁciencies are given in ﬁg. 3. This
conﬁrms that toroidal effects reduce the efﬁciency
of current drive and that this reduction can be min-
imized if the waves are absorbed on the high-ﬁeld
side of the torus where there are fewest trapped par-
ticles.

Relaxed state of a slightly resistive and turbulent magnetized plasma is

obtained by invoking the Principle of Minimum Dissipation which leads to

∇ × ∇ × ∇ × B = ΛB.

A solution of the above equation is accomplished using the analytic continu-
ation of the Chandrasekhar-Kendall eigenfunctions in the complex domain.
The new features of this theory is to show (i) a single ﬂuid can relax to an
MHD equilibrium which can support pressure gradient even without a long-
term coupling between mechanical ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld (ii) ﬁeld reversal
(RFP) in states that are not force-free.

Abstract.

1

In the well-known theory of relaxation of magnetoplasma, Taylor[1] pro-
posed that the process of relaxation is governed by the principle of mini-
mum total magnetic energy and invariance of total (global) magnetic helic-
V A · BdV where the integration is over the entire volume, the
ity K =
latter being the most signiﬁcant invariant in the theory of relaxation. Ac-
cordingly the relaxed state of a magnetoplasma satisﬁes the corresponding
Euler-Lagrange equation

R

∇ × B = λB

(1)

with constant λ, and, consequently, is a force-free state. Taylor’s theory is
quite successful in explaining a number of experimental results, including
those of RFP. However, relaxed states as envisaged by Taylor, have only zero
pressure gradient.

Extensive numerical works by Sato and his collaborators have estab-
lished [2],[3] the existence of self-organized states with ﬁnite pressure, i.e.
these states are governed by the magnetohydrodynamic force balance rela-
tion, namely, j × B = ∇p, rather than j × B = 0. Recently, it has been
demonstrated both by numerical simulation[4] and by experiments[5] that
counter-helicity merging of two spheromaks can produce a Field-Reversed
Conﬁguration (FRC). The FRC has zero toroidal magnetic ﬁeld and the
plasma is conﬁned entirely by poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. It has a ﬁnite pressure
with a relatively high value of β. It may be concluded that FRC, with its
non zero perpendicular component of current, is a relaxed state and it is a
distinctly non-force free state. From the point of view of plasma relaxation,
the formation of FRC through the counter-helicity merging of two sphero-
maks is a unique process where a non-force free state emerges from the fusion
of two Taylor states. The conclusion is that there exists a general class of
relaxed states which are not always force-free, and Taylor’s force-free states
constitute only a subclass of this wider class. While Taylor states do not
support any pressure gradient, equilibrium obtained from the principle of
minimum energy accommodates pressure gradients only in presence of ﬂow.
Several attempts[6],[8] have been made in the past to obtain relaxed states
which could support ﬁnite pressure gradient, a large number of them making
use of the coupling of the ﬂow with magnetic ﬁeld[9]-[12].

The principle of ”minimum rate of entropy production”, formulated by
Prigogine[13] and others, is believed to play a major role in many problems of
irreversible thermodynamics. Dissipation, along with nonlinearity, is ubiqui-
tous in systems which evolve towards self-organized states. Another closely
related concept, the principle of minimum dissipation rate was used for the
ﬁrst time by Montgomery and Phillips[14] in an MHD problem to understand
the steady state proﬁles of RFP conﬁguration under the constraint of con-
stant rate of supply and dissipation of helicity the usual physical boundary

conditions for a conducting wall. It may be pointed out that the principle of
minimum dissipation was also discussed by Chandrasekhar and Woltzer[16]
in a sequel to the complete general solution of the force-free equation by
Chandrasekhar and Kendall [15]. The minimum dissipation rate hypothesis
was later used by a number of authors [17],[18] to predict the current and
magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles of driven dissipative systems.

This paper deals with the question of determining the ﬁeld conﬁgurations
assumed by a magnetoﬂuid in a relaxed state in absence of any external
ﬁelds, while maintaining that the relaxation is governed by the hypothesis of
minimum rate of energy dissipation. It is our conjecture that relaxed states
could be characterized as the states of minimum dissipation rather than
states of minimum energy. The novel feature of our work is to show that it
is possible for a single ﬂuid to relax to an MHD equilibrium with a magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration which can support pressure gradient, even without a long-
term coupling between the ﬂow and the magnetic ﬁeld. In a recent work,
Steinhauer[12] has claimed that single ﬂuid MHD theory can admit only a
force free state and one need to take recourse to a two ﬂuid theory so that
electromechanical coupling produces pressure gradient and a non force free
state. Our work establishes that none of these requirements need be satisﬁed
to obtain a relaxed state of the desired kind.

In what follows we derive the Euler-Lagrange equation from a varia-
tional principle with minimum energy dissipation and conservation of total
magnetic helicity, solve the equation in terms of the analytically continued
Chandrasekhar-Kendall eigenfunctions, discuss the important role played by
the boundary conditions, and present our results for the ﬂux, ﬁeld reversal
parameter and pinch parameter. We also compute the helicity integral, and
show the plots of magnetic ﬁeld, current, and pressure proﬁles. The ﬁeld
reversal parameter from our theory is deﬁnitely in better agreement with the
experimental value than what is obtained from Taylor’s theory.

We consider a closed system of an incompressible, resistive magnetoﬂuid,
without any mean ﬂow velocity, described by the standard MHD equations
in presence of a small but ﬁnite resistivity η. In the absence of any externally
imposed electric ﬁelds, the ohmic dissipation rate R is itself a time varying
quantity. However, it is possible to ﬁnd constraints that are better preserved
than the rate of energy dissipation, so that the system self-organizes to certain
relaxed states, which remain stable over time scales short compared to ohmic
dissipation time. In this case, helicity still serves to hold as a good constraint
as it decays at a time scale much slower in comparison to the decay time scale
of the rate of energy dissipation as is evident from the simulation works of
Zhu et. al. [3]. In the following, we compare the decay rates of the energy

From the above two equations, we see that the decay rate of energy dissi-
pation is once again O(1) at scale lengths for which k ≈ S
2 . But at these
scale lengths, helicity dissipation is only O(S−1/2) << 1. Thus, we may ex-
pect that in presence of small scale turbulence, the rate of energy dissipation
decays at a faster rate than helicity.

We therefore minimize the ohmic dissipation R =

ηj2dV subject to the

constraints of helicity

A · BdV . The variational equation is given by

R

where λ is Lagrange’s undetermined multiplier. The variation can be shown
to lead to the Euler-Lagrange equation

(3)

where, Λ = λ/η is a constant. The surface terms in the equation vanish if
we consider the boundary condition δA × n = as well as j × n = 0, which is
the physical boundary condition we will impose in the problem.

We like to emphasize that eq.(3) is a general equation which embraces the
Woltzer-Taylor equation ( i.e. eq. (1) ) as a special case. Now we proceed to
construct a solution of eq.(3) and show that the general solutions can have
j × B 6= 0. In other words, eq.(3) may lead to a non force-free state.

The solution of eq.(3) can be constructed using the Chandrasekhar-Kendall
(CK) eigenfunctions. Chandrasekhar and Kendall’s solution[15] of the equa-
tion ∇×B = λ B can be written (with three parameters µ, m, k in cylindrical
coordinates), as,

B(µ, m, k) = λ∇Φ × ∇z + ∇ × (∇Φ × ∇z)
(4)
where, Φ = Jm(µr) exp[i(mθ − kz)] with λ2 = µ2 + k2. Here, Jm is a Bessel
Function of order m and the value of µ in the argument is determined from
the boundary condition at r = a, which is given as (ˆn · B)r=a = 0

Analytic continuation of the above solution for complex values of µ (or k)
is straightforward. For real values of λ (and hence of µ and k) the operator

4

(∇×) has been proved to be self-adjoint, but not so in the larger space
spanned by the analytically continued CK solutions.

We introduce the complex parameters

µn =

(µ2 + k2)exp(4nπ i/3) − k2
h

i

1/2

, n = 1, 2

so that µ2

n + k2 = λ2ω2n, ω = exp(2πi/3), and deﬁne

B1 = B(µ, m, k) = λ∇Φ × ∇z + ∇ × (∇Φ × ∇z)
B2 = B(µ1, m, k) = λω∇Φ1 × ∇z + ∇ × (∇Φ1 × ∇z)
B3 = B(µ2, m, k) = λω2∇Φ2 × ∇z + ∇ × (∇Φ2 × ∇z)

In the last two expressions above, Φ1 and Φ2 are obtained from Φ by replacing
µ by µ1 and µ2 respectively.

A solution of eq.(3) can now be obtained as a linear combination of

B1, B2, B3 :

B = α1B1 + α2B2 + α3B3

where αi are constants, with at least two of them non-zero. It can be easily
demonstrated that the expression for B given in (7) is a solution of eq.(3)
with Λ = λ3.

A reasonable boundary condition is to assume a perfectly conducting wall,

From eq. (6), it is evident that B2 and B3 are complex conjugate of one
another. This, together with the relations obtained in eq. (10), shows that
the magnetic ﬁeld given by eq. (7) is a real ﬁeld. We also list the follow-
ing expressions for the m = 0, k = 0 state (cylindrically symmetric state)

For a given value of m and ka, the value of λa can be obtained from
the boundary condition given by eq. (11).
It is to be noted that for the
cylindrically symmetric state the boundary condition is trivially satisﬁed
and hence does not determine λa. It can be easily proved that the state of
minimum dissipation is equivalent to the state of minimum value of Λ. To
get the numerical value of λ for m 6= 0, we solve numerically eq.(11) and
obtain λa = 3.11 and ka = 1.23 as the minimum values of λa and ka for the
m = 1 state.
The only undetermined constant in eq. (7) is the value of α1 (the value of
the ﬁeld amplitude) which can be determined by specifying the toroidal ﬂux
Φz. The m = k = 0 state is responsible for non-zero values of toroidal ﬂux
which is obtained as

Φz = 2πα1λa

A couple of dimensionless quantities that have proved useful in describing
laboratory experiments are the ﬁeld reversal parameter F = Bz(a)/< Bz >
and the pinch parameter Θ = Bθ(a)/< Bz >, where < .. > represents a
volume average. After substituting the expressions for Bz(a) etc, we get

The pinch ratio Θ is related to the ratio of the current and ﬂux and is a

physically controllable quantity. For the Taylor state Θ = λa/2.

The details of any relaxed state are determined by two physically mean-
ingful parameters, the toroidal ﬂux and the volts-seconds of the discharge.
The toroidal ﬂux as deﬁned earlier serves to determine the ﬁeld amplitude
and the volts-seconds describes the helicity of the relaxed state through the
2
relation: volts − sec = helicity/ﬂux
. We therefore calculate the helicity in-
tegral (global helicity) from our solution for the m = 0, k = 0 state and

We then calculate the volts-seconds for the cylindrically symmetric state
using λa = 3.11. For the minimum value of λa = 3.11, the critical value of
volts-seconds = 12.8 R/a. For values of volts-seconds less than this critical
value, a lower value of λa is obtained from solving the equation for K/Φ2
z
so that the cylindically symmetric state is the relaxed state for minimum
energy dissipation. For values of volts-seconds greater than the critical value
the system relaxes to the helically distorted state with λa = 3.11 which is
obtained as a mixture of the m = 0, k = 0 and the m = 1, k 6= 0 states as in
the case of Taylor’s theory.

The proﬁles for the current and magnetic ﬁeld are shown in Figs. 1 and
2 for the m = 0, k = 0 state with the value of λa < 3.11 (i.e., volts-sec
< 12.8R/a). At a value of λa greater than 2.95, the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle Bz
vs r shows a reversal near the edge ( Fig.2 ). Also, jz and jθ go to zero at
the wall because of the boundary conditions we have chosen. The values of
both F and Θ at the boundary r = a are evaluated and F is plotted against
pinch ratio Θ ( Fig.3 ). It is observed that F reverses at a value of Θ = 2.4,
(λa = 2.95) whereas for the Taylor state the reversal is achieved at Θ = 1.2.
However, this ﬁeld reversed state supports pressure gradient in constrast to
the Taylor state. The q-proﬁle, where q = rBz/RBθ is shown in Fig. 4 for
λa = 3.0.

The pressure proﬁle can be obtained from the relation j × B = ∇p. For
the m = 0, k = 0 state, the only nonvanishing component of the pressure
gradient exists in the radial direction. The pressure proﬁle is shown in Fig.
5 for the m = k = 0 state with λa = 3.0 which is the minimum energy
dissipation, ﬁeld reversed state.

To conclude, the principle of minimum dissipation is utilized together
with the constraints of constant magnetic helicity to determine the relaxed
states of a magnetoplasma not driven externally. The variational principle
leads to a remarkable Euler-Lagrange equation, and it is shown that this
equation involving higher order curl operator can be solved in terms of of an
analytical continuation of Chandrasekhar-Kendall functions in the complex

7

domain with appropriate boundary conditions. This relaxed state obtained
from single ﬂuid MHD supports pressure gradient. A coupling between mag-
netic ﬁeld and ﬂow is not an essential criterion for having a non-zero pressure
gradient. Further, it is shown that a non force-free state with ﬁeld reversal
properties can exist.

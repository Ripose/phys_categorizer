Oblique incidence of a p-polarized laser beam on a fully ionized plasma with a low density plasma
corona is investigated numerically by Particle-In-Cell and Vlasov simulations in two dimensions.
Energetic electrons which propagate into the plasma corona in front the target are observed. The
fast electrons are collimated by quasi-steady magnetic ﬁelds. The magnetic ﬁelds enhance the
penetration depth of the electrons into the corona. A scaling law for the angle of the ejected
electrons with incident laser intensity is given.

The availability of tabletop high intensity laser systems has lead to the investigation of novel regimes of short pulse
laser-plasma interaction. Recently the emission of collimated electron jets under specular angles with respect to the
density normal direction have been observed for an obliquely incident laser beam on a steep density plasma [1].

When a target is irradiated by an intense laser pulse above the ﬁeld ionization threshold it quickly ionizes [2].
For suﬃciently long laser pulse irradiation the plasma present on the surface gradually expands into the vacuum
with the ion acoustic speed. Hence, a plasma corona is formed. For short laser pulses there is not enough time for
hydrodynamic expansion. Short pulse simulations show however, that an ion shelf is formed on a typical time scale
ts = ω−1
0 (mi/Zme)1/2 due to the generation of a strong electric ﬁeld at the plasma-vacuum interface [3]. This ion
shelf represents a low density plasma corona.

There are diﬀerent mechanisms which can lead to collimated electron jets when an intense laser pulse interacts
with a vastly overdense, steep density plasma that has a low density plasma corona. One eﬀect that plays a role
in the interaction is the Brunel eﬀect [4] which works for oblique incidence. Here the electrons are accelerated into
the vacuum as well as into the target by the electric ﬁeld present along the density gradient. The coronal plasma is
expected to collimate and enhance the range of the ejected electrons in two (2D) or three (3D) spatial dimensions by
quasi-steady magnetic ﬁeld generation. The collimating eﬀect of quasi-steady ﬁelds has recently been addressed in
[5,6] in a diﬀerent context.

To investigate the phenomenon just outlined in more detail we perform Particle-In-Cell (PIC) and Vlasov (VL)
simulations both in two spatial dimensions (2D). In both approaches we do not simulate the evolution of the corona
self-consistently but treat it parametrically. In our PIC simulations we rotate the target and in our VL simulations
we boost to the frame of normal incidence to model oblique incidence of the laser beam. The boost frame method is
well established in 1D [7–9]. It is however also helpful in 2D.

·

We investigate the interaction of a p-polarized laser beam incident under angles of 30◦ (PIC) and 45◦ (VL) on a
preformed fully ionized target with an underdense plasma corona in front of it. In both simulations the laser beam
1018W/cm2 and for the VL case
has a duration of about 100fs. For the PIC case the laser beam intensity is 2.0
1017W/cm2. The laser wavelength in the simulations is 1µm with beam diameters of 8 µm (PIC) and 5 µm
1.0
(VL) at full-width-half-maximum. The coordinates of the simulation box are x and y, respectively. The size of the
simulation box is 23 µm
13 µm for the VL simulations. The distribution
functions for the electrons and ions needed for the the VL simulations have two momentum directions px and py in
addition. The quasi-particle number per cell used in the PIC simulations is 50 for each species. The fully ionized
plasma density is 4nc (PIC) and 8nc (VL). In both simulations we assume a low density plasma corona with a density
of 0.1nc in front of the target.

Plot (a) of Figure 1 gives the quasi-steady magnetic ﬁeld Bz in front of the target obtained by PIC simulations. The
plasma target has been rotated by 30◦ as can be inferred from the ﬁgure. The peak value of the normalized magnetic
ﬁeld is 0.62, which corresponds to approximately 30 MG. It changes polarity along the density gradient. The polarity
of the ﬁeld is such that it collimates the emitted electrons from the target surface. The low density plasma corona
guarantees quasi-neutrality and helps to generate the magnetic ﬁeld in front of the target. Plot (b) of the same ﬁgure
shows the electron energy density. We ﬁnd a collimated electron jet which coincides with the quasi-steady magnetic
ﬁeld from plot (a). We observe that the electrons are ejected almost normally to the target surface. For the parameters
of plot (b) the ejection angle is approximately 17◦. There are also fast electrons injected into the overdense plasma.
We again observe that they are almost normal to the target surface. Figure 1 (c) shows the instantaneous plot of the
electron energy density with overplotted positive Bz ﬁeld indicating the phase of the laser ﬁeld. It is clearly seen that
the outgoing electrons are generated on the target surface once per laser cycle by the Brunel absorption mechanism
[4,8] and are bunched on the scale of the laser wavelength consequently. The range of the electrons is enhanced. A
similar result we obtain from our VL simulations which make use of boost frame coordinates.

To illustrate how the boost frame approach for oblique incidence in 2D works we brieﬂy derive the correct boundary
conditions for the laser pulse in the boosted frame. We start by deﬁning an arbitrary pulse envelope function z(x, y, t)
in the lab-frame. Next we perform a Lorentz rotation of electromagnetic ﬁelds about (x0, y0). In the ﬁnal step we
boost the latter to the frame of normal incidence for which the longitudinal ﬁeld Ex disappears. We obtain

The function z is the same function as in the lab-frame. For the relativistic factors we have ¯β = sin θ and ¯γ = 1/ cos θ,
where θ is the angle of incidence. Plot (a) of Figure 2 illustrates the incident time resolved electromagnetic ﬁeld Ey
for a Gaussian pulse envelope. Plot (b) of the same ﬁgure gives the incident time resolved electromagnetic ﬁeld Ey of
the simulations.

Plot (a) of Figure 3 gives the quasi-steady magnetic ﬁeld in the plasma corona in front of the overdense plasma
target. Plot (b) of the same ﬁgure gives the quasi-steady magnetic ﬁeld with the quasi-steady B2
z overplotted (red
solid lines). Plot (c) of Figure 3 gives the quasi-steady magnetic ﬁeld with the quasi-steady longitudinal current
density jxe overplotted (red dashed lines).

Since the current density jxe is invariant under Lorentz boosts along y it may serve as a quantity from which to
determine the direction of the electron jets. We now introduce the coordinates χ = xB and ξ = yB + ¯βctB which move
along with the background plasma current present in the boosted frame. Since the time-averaged current density

in the comoving coordinates varies slowly with time we obtain

(χ, ξ). This yields

The direction of the collimated electron jets in the lab frame can now be calculated from the direction of the current
jB
. The direction of the emitted electrons is indicated by
density in the boosted frame. Plot (c) of Figure 3 gives
xe
the white solid line plotted in the ﬁgure. We obtain a mean emission angle of 20◦ in the boosted frame and 14◦ in
the lab frame. We note that the lab frame is dilated in transverse direction when viewed from the boosted frame and
hence the emission angle in the boost frame is larger by a factor of ¯γ = 1/

¯β2 as indicated by Equation (4).

In boost frame coordinates we may easily analyze the physical mechanism that leads to the large areal quasi-steady
magnetic ﬁeld and the direction of the ejected electrons. We recall that in the boosted frame we have a constant
background ﬂuid velocity uB = c sin θ which approaches speed of light for large angles of incidence. In this frame the
polarization of the magnetic ﬁeld vector of the incident laser beam is normal to the xy-plane and to the ﬂow direction
of the background current. If the laser intensity is small enough as in [1] and the angle of incidence suﬃciently large
the boost velocity exceeds the laser quiver velocity. The driving force under these conditions is exerted predominantly
by the oscillating magnetic ﬁeld of the laser beam (see the red solid contour lines of B2
z plotted over Bz in plot (b)
of Figure 3 for the location of the force). The resulting force is F =
B and is capable of ejecting electrons
out of the surface at a rate of once per laser cycle. This is the Brunel mechanism [4]. The quasi-steady magnetic ﬁeld
in the plasma corona is generated by the electron current emitted from the target. The polarization of the magnetic
ﬁeld is such that it collimates the electrons propagating through the plasma corona.

To derive an approximate criterion for the angle range under which the fast electrons are emitted from the target
surface we assume that the laser target interaction in the boosted frame is quasi-onedimensional. Since the full-width-
half-maximum of the laser beams in our simulations is at least 5 µm and the intensities are suﬃciently low to prevent
target imprinting we believe that this assumption is justiﬁed. We next rewrite the Vlasov equation in the boosted
frame [10] and solve it for an initial Maxwellian. We approximate the plasma-vacuum interface by a step-like density
proﬁle with n(x) = n0 for x > 0 and treat the ions as immobile. We obtain for the distribution function

In conclusion we have demonstrated with the help of two diﬀerent simulation techniques that collimated electrons
with enhanced range can be emitted from an overdense target if a low density plasma corona is present. In addition,
we have shown that fast electrons are injected into the overdense plasma. Both, the ejection and injection directions
are almost along the density normal direction for p-polarized light. By a transformation to the moving frame in which
the laser pulse appears to be normally incident we were able to give a criterion for the angle range of the emitted
electrons with ejection momentum. We ﬁnd that for a planar interaction interface only speed of light electrons can
be emitted at specular direction for p-polarized light. Less energetic electrons appear under almost normal emission
angles due to a lack of lateral momentum transfer. This analytical result is in qualitative agreement with our numerical
observations. We note that in addition to the mechanism outlined in this paper other mechanisms of fast electron
generation like wakeﬁeld acceleration in the corona may exist leading diﬀerent emission angles.

Abstract. Nonlinear self-modulation of the dust acoustic waves is studied, in the
presence of non-thermal (non-Maxwellian) ion and electron populations. By em-
ploying a multiple scale technique, a nonlinear Schr¨odinger-type equation (NLSE)
is derived for the wave amplitude. The inﬂuence of non-thermality, in addition to
obliqueness (between the propagation and modulation directions), on the condi-
tions for modulational instability to occur is discussed. Diﬀerent types of localized
solutions (envelope excitations) which may possibly occur are discussed, and the
dependence of their characteristics on physical parameters is traced. The ion de-
viation from a Maxwellian distribution comes out to be more important than the
electron analogous deviation alone. Both yield a de-stabilizing eﬀect on (the am-
plitude of) DAWs propagating in a dusty plasma with negative dust grains. The
opposite eﬀect, namely a tendency towards amplitude stabilization, is found for the
case of positively charged dust presence in the plasma.

1. Introduction
Dust contaminated plasmas have recently received considerable interest due to their
wide occurrence in real charged particle systems, both in space and laboratory
plasmas, and to the novel physics involved in their description [1, 2]. An issue of
particular interest is the existence of special acoustic-like oscillatory modes, e.g.
the dust-acoustic wave (DAW) and dust-ion-acoustic wave (DIAW), which were
theoretically predicted about a decade ago [3, 4] and later experimentally conﬁrmed
[5, 6]. The DAW, which we consider herein, is a fundamental electrostatic mode in
an unmagnetized dusty plasma (DP), which has no analogue in an ordinary e-i
(electron - ion) plasma. It represents electrostatic oscillations of mesoscopic size,
massive, charged dust grains against a background of electrons and ions which,
given the low frequency of interest, are practically in a thermalized (i.e. Boltzmann)
equilibrium state. The phase speed of the DAW is much smaller than the electron
and ion thermal speeds, and the DAW frequency is below the dust plasma frequency.

The amplitude (self-) modulation of the DAse waves has been recently considered
[7 - 9], by means of the reductive perturbation formalism [10]. A study of the mod-
ulational stability proﬁle of DA waves has shown that long/short wavelength DA
waves are stable/unstable against external perturbations. The respective parameter
regions are associated with the occurrence of localized envelope excitations of the
dark/bright type (i.e. voids/pulses). Obliqueness in perturbations are found shown
to modify this dynamic behaviour [7 - 9].

Allowing for a departure from Boltzmann’s distribution for the electrostatic back-
ground (non-thermality) has been shown to bear a considerable eﬀect on electro-
static plasma modes. Inspired by earlier works on the ion-acoustic (IA) solitary
waves [11], recent studies have shown that the presence of a non-thermal ion ve-
locity distribution may modify the nonlinear behaviour of the DA waves, aﬀecting
both the form and the conditions for the occurrence of the DA solitons [12, 13].
Also, the self-modulation of IA waves was recently shown to be aﬀected by the
electron non-thermality [14]. However, no study has been carried out of the eﬀect
of a non-thermal ion and/or electron background population on the modulation
properties of the DA waves. This paper aims at ﬁlling this gap.

2. The model

Let us consider the propagation of the dust-acoustic waves in an unmagnetized
dusty plasma. The mass and charge of dust grains (both assumed constant, for
qd|
simplicity) will be denoted by md and qd = s Zde, where s = sgnqd ≡
|
denotes the sign of the dust charge (=
1). Similarly, we have: mi and qi = +Zie
e for electrons. The typical DAW frequency will be
for ions, and me and qe =
assumed much lower than the (inverse of the) characteristic dust grain charging
time scale, so charge variation eﬀects (known to lead to collisionless wave damping)
will be omitted here.

harmonic) depends on the angle θ (and is, in fact, an even, π
periodic function of
θ).

4. Stability proﬁle – envelope excitations

The evolution of a wave whose amplitude obeys Eq. (3.2) essentially depends on
the sign of the product P Q (see, e.g., in Ref. 16 for details; also see in Refs. 9
and 17) which may be numerically investigated in terms of the physical parameters
involved.

For P Q > 0, the DA wave is modulationally unstable and may either collapse,
when subject to external perturbations, or evolve into a series of bright -type local-
ized envelope wavepackets, which represent a pulse-shaped solution of the NLSE
(3.2). This type of solution is depicted in Fig. 2.

For P Q < 0, on the other hand, the DA wave is stable and may propagate as
a dark/grey-type envelope wavepacket, i.e. a propagating localized envelope hole
(a void ) amidst a uniform wave energy region. Notice the qualitative diﬀerence
between the dark and grey solutions (depicted in Fig. 3a and b, respectively): the
potential vanishes in the former, while it remains ﬁnite in the latter.

The exact analytical expressions for diﬀerent types of envelope excitations (de-
picted in Figs. 2 and 3) are summarized in Refs. 9 and 17; more details can be
found in Ref. 18. We note that, in either case (i.e. for positive or negative prod-
uct P Q), the localized excitation width L and maximum amplitude ψ0 satisfy
Lψ0 = (2P/Q)1/2 = constant. The dynamics, therefore, essentially depends on
the quantity η = P/Q, whose sign (magnitude) will determine the wave’s stability
proﬁle and the type (characteristics, respectively) of the localized envelope excita-
tions which may occur.

5. Numerical analysis

According to the above analysis, both the DAW stability proﬁle and the type of DA
envelope excitations possibly occurring in the plasma are determined by the sign
of the product of the NLSE coeﬃcients P and Q, which is essentially a function
of the (normalized) wavenumber k, the dust parameter µ, the temperature ratio
ti and the non-thermality parameters ai,e, in addition to the modulation
Ti/Te ≡
angle θ. The exact expressions obtained for P and Q may now be used for the
numerical investigation of the wave’s modulational stability proﬁle.

In the ﬁgures provided here (see Figs. 4 - 9), the black/white regions represent a
negative/positive P Q sign, implying DAW being modulationally stable/ unstable
(and possibly propagating in the form of dark/bright type excitations, respectively).
Throughout this Section, we have used the set of representative values: ti =
Ti/Te = 0.1, Zi = 1 and δ = Zdnd,0/(Zini,0) = 0.25, implying µ = 0.75 for
negatively charged dust (and µ = 1.25 for positively dust charge; cf. the deﬁnitions
above). The (normalized) wavenumber k, modulation angle (0 6 θ 6 π) and the
non-thermality parameters (0 6 ae,i < 1) will be allowed to vary according to the
focus of our investigation. The negative dust charge case (s =
1) is implied, unless
otherwise mentioned.

5.1. Parallel modulation

In the special case of the parallel modulation (θ = 0), the analytical behaviour of P
3ω5/(2k4) < 0 for θ = 0 so that
and Q was brieﬂy studied in Ref. 15. See that P =
1 one then obtains the approximate
one only has to study the sign of Q. For k
(3 + 2sα)2/(12k) > 0, which prescribes
expression [15]: P
stability (and dark/grey type envelope excitations – voids) for long wavelengths.
For shorter wavelengths, i.e. for k > kcr (where kcr is some critical wavenumber,
to be determined numerically), Q changes sign (becomes negative), and the wave
may become unstable.

≪

In addition to the above results, an increase in the non-thermal population (i.e. in
the value of ai) – for negative dust charge – was shown to favor instability at lower
values of k [15]. Large wavelengths always remain stable and may only propagate as
dark-type excitations. The opposite qualitative behaviour was witnessed for positive
dust charge, where deviation from thermality (i.e. increasing ai > 0) appears to
Ti) were used
favor stability. Even though the approximate expressions (for Te ≪
in Ref. 15, a similar qualitative behaviour is obtained in the general case (see below).

5.2. Obliqueness eﬀects

Let us now consider an arbitrary value of θ. First, we note that, for small wavenum-
(3 + 2sα)2/(12k) < 0, so that

We proceed by a numerical investigation of the sign of the coeﬃcient product
P Q in the (k, θ) plane; see Fig. 4. The proﬁle thus obtained is qualitatively rem-
iniscent of the results in Ref. 9: the critical wavenumber, say kcr, beyond which
P Q changes sign, decreases as the modulation obliqueness angle θ increases from
zero (parralel modulation) to - roughly - 0.5 rad (i.e. approximately 30), implying a
destabilization of the DAW amplitude for lower wave number (higher wavelength)
values. Now, above 0.5 rad (i.e. 60), approximately, and up to π/2 rad (i.e. 90,
transverse modulation) the wave remains stable.

A question naturally arises at this stage: how does the forementioned stability
proﬁle depend on the non thermal character of the background? The ion and elec-
tron non-thermality eﬀects are separately treated in the following paragraphs.

5.3. Ion non-thermality eﬀects
Let us vary the value of the ion non-thermality parameter ai. Passing to a ﬁnite
value of ai = 0.2 results in a narrower stability region for small angles (i.e. kcr, at
which P Q(kcr) = 0, decreases with ai, for small θ) – see Fig. 4b, while the inﬂuence
on the behaviour for larger angles is less important. Therefore, a non Maxwellian
ion population seems to favor modulational instability at lower wavenumber values,
at least for a small to moderate modulation obliqueness. This eﬀect may be depicted
by keeping the value of θ ﬁxed, while varying the value of ai; see Figs. 5.

5.4. Electron non-thermality eﬀects

In analogy to the previous paragraph, we may now vary the value of the elec-
tron non-thermality parameter ae. The eﬀect is qualitatively similar, yet far less
dramatic; see Figs. 6. This is physically expected, since the inﬂuence of the back-
ground ions on the inertial dust grains is more important than that of the lighter
electrons.

8

I. Kourakis and P. K. Shukla

5.5. Positive dust

The analogous investigation in the positive dust case (s = +1; µ = 1.25 everywhere
below) reveals a qualitatively diﬀerent picture. First of all, the addition of positive
dust is known to result in a slightly wider stability region (as compared to the
negative qd picture), thus bearing the opposite eﬀect from negative dust; compare
Figs. 4 and 7; also cf. the discussion in Ref. 9.

As far as the inﬂuence of ion non-thermality on stability is concerned, the qual-
itative eﬀect seems to be the opposite as in the preceding paragraphs. For a given
value of the angle θ, increasing the ion “non-Maxwellian” parameter ai seems to
result in a more stable conﬁguration, extending e.g. the black region in Fig 7, for
θ = 0; for higher θ, the result is similar, yet less dramatic (unless for a very strong
deviation from the Maxwell distribution; see Fig. 8c).

Finally, taking into account electron non-thermality, i.e. increasing the electron
parameter ae from zero to a ﬁnite value yields a similar eﬀect, yet much less im-
portant eﬀect, for practically all values of θ and k.

In conclusion, the stability of DAWs propagating in a dusty plasma with positively
charged dust grains seems to be enhanced by the appearance of a non-thermal
background component.

6. Conclusions

We have investigated the amplitude modulation of dust acoustic waves in the pres-
ence of a non-thermal (non-Maxwellian) ion and/or electron background, focusing
on the inﬂuence of the latter on the stability proﬁle, and also on the conditions for
the occurrence of envelope excitations.

Summarizing our results, we ﬁnd that the presence of non-Maxwellian electron
an/or ion distribution(s) is expected to yield a de-stabilizing eﬀect on the DAW
propagation in a plasma with negatively charged dust grains (favoring bright rather
than dark-type envelope wave packets), in particular for a moderate modulation
obliqueness. This eﬀect is (qualitatively similar but) stronger for nonthermal ions
rather than electrons. In the presence of a transverse modulation, the wave’s sta-
bility proﬁle remains intact.

On the other hand, the stability of the DAWs propagating in a dusty plasma with
positively charged dust grains seems to be slightly enhanced by the appearance
of a nonthermal electron and ion components. Again, this eﬀect is stronger for
nonthermal ions rather than electrons; also, transversely modulated DAWs remain
stable. Finally, dark rather than bright type envelope wave packets will be rather
favored in this (positive dust charge) case.

Figure captions

Figure 1:
The non-thermal distribution f (v; a), as deﬁned by Eq. (2.4) [scaled by f (v; 0) =
1/√2π], vs. the reduced velocity v/vth, for a = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 (from top to bottom).

Figure 2:
Bright type localized envelope modulated wavepackets (for P Q > 0) for two

diﬀerent (arbitrary) sets of parameter values.

Figure 3:
(a) Dark and (b) grey type localized envelope modulated wavepackets (for P Q <

0). See that the amplitude never reaches zero in the latter case.

Figure 4:
The sign of the product P Q is depicted vs. (normalized) wavenumber k (hori-
zontal axis) and modulation angle θ (vertical axis), via a color code: black (white)
regions denote a negative (positive) sign of P Q, implying stability (instability), and
suggesting dark (bright) type envelope soliton occurrence. Here, µ = 0.75 (negative
dust charge) and: (a) ai = ae = 0 (Maxwellian background); (b) ai = 0.2, ae = 0
(ion non-thermality); (c) ai = 0, ae = 0.2 (electron non-thermality). Remaining
parameter values as cited in the text. See that the eﬀect in (c) is rather negligible.

Figure 5:
The sign of the product P Q is depicted vs. (normalized) wavenumber k (hori-
zontal axis) and ion non-thermality parameter ai (vertical axis), for a modulation
angle θ equal to: (a) 0 (parallel modulation); (b) 0.4; (c) π/4; the case θ = π/2 –
transverse modulation – is omitted, since globally stable. Same color code as in Fig.
4: black (white) regions denote a negative (positive) sign of P Q. Here, µ = 0.75
(negative dust charge) and ae = 0 (Maxwellian electrons). Remaining parameter
values as cited in the text.

Figure 6:
Similar to the preceding Figure, but for non-thermal electrons and Maxwellian
ions: the sign of the product P Q is depicted vs. (normalized) wavenumber k (hori-
zontal axis) and electron non-thermality parameter ae (vertical axis), for a modula-
tion angle θ equal to: (a) 0 (parallel modulation); (b) 0.4; (c) π/4; the case θ = π/2
– transverse modulation – is omitted, since globally stable. Same color code as in
Fig. 4: black (white) regions denote a negative (positive) sign of P Q. Here, µ = 0.75
(negative dust charge) and ai = 0 (Maxwellian ions). Remaining parameter values
are cited in the text.

Figure 7:

12

I. Kourakis and P. K. Shukla

Similar to Figure 4, but for a positive dust charge; here, µ = 1.25. The sign of
the product P Q is depicted vs. (normalized) wavenumber k (horizontal axis) and
modulation angle θ (vertical axis), for: (b) ai = 0.2, ae = 0 (ion non-thermality);
(c) ai = 0, ae = 0.2 (electron non-thermality). Remaining parameter values as in
Fig. 4. See that the eﬀect in (c) is not as dramatic as in (b).

Figure 8:
Similar to Figure 5, but for a positive dust charge; here, µ = 1.25 and ae = 0
(remaining parameter values as in Fig. 5). The sign of the product P Q is depicted
vs. (normalized) wavenumber k (horizontal axis) and ion non-thermality parameter
ai (vertical axis), for a modulation angle θ equal to: (a) 0 (parallel modulation); (b)
0.4; (c) π/4; the case θ = π/2 – transverse modulation – is omitted, since globally
stable.

Figure 9:
Similar to Figure 6, but for a positive dust charge; here, µ = 1.25 and ai = 0 (re-
maining parameter values as in Fig. 6). The sign of the product P Q is depicted vs.
(normalized) wavenumber k (horizontal axis) and electron non-thermality parame-
ter ae (vertical axis), for a modulation angle θ equal to: (a) 0 (parallel modulation);
(b) 0.4; (c) π/4; the case θ = π/2 – transverse modulation – is omitted, since glob-
ally stable. See that the electron non-thermality eﬀect is less important than its ion
counterpart (cf. Fig. 6).

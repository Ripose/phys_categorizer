Abstract

In a fully 3-D system such as a stellarator, the toroidal mode number n ceases to be a good quantum
number—all ns within a given mode family being coupled. It is found that the discrete spectrum of unstable ideal
MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) instabilities ceases to exist unless MHD is modiﬁed (regularized) by introducing
a short-perpendicular-wavelength cutoﬀ. Attempts to use ray tracing to estimate the regularized MHD spectrum
fail due to the occurrence of chaotic ray trajectories. In quantum chaos theory, strong chaos in the semiclassical
limit leads to eigenvalue statistics the same as those of a suitable ensemble of random matrices. For instance, the
probability distribution function for the separation between neighboring eigenvalues is as derived from random
matrix theory and goes to zero at zero separation. This contrasts with the Poissonian distribution found in
separable systems, showing that a signature of quantum chaos is level repulsion. In order to determine whether
eigenvalues of the regularized MHD problem obey the same statistics as those of the Schr¨odinger equation in
both the separable 1-D case and the chaotic 3-D cases, we have assembled data sets of ideal MHD eigenvalues
for a Suydam-unstable cylindrical (1-D) equilibrium using Mathematica and a Mercier-unstable (3-D) equilibrium
using the CAS3D code. In the 1-D case, we ﬁnd that the unregularized Suydam-approximation spectrum has an
anomalous peak at zero eigenvalue separation. On the other hand, regularization by restricting the domain of k⊥
recovers the expected Poissonian distribution. In the 3-D case we ﬁnd strong evidence of level repulsion within
mode families, but mixing mode families produces Poissonian statistics.

1.Introduction

In ideal MHD the spectrum of the growth rates,
γ, of instabilities is diﬃcult to characterize math-
ematically because the linearized force operator
is not compact [1]. This gives rise to the possi-
bility of a dense set of accumulation points (de-
scriptively called the “accumulation continuum”
by Spies and Tataronis [2] though more correctly
termed [3] the essential spectrum).

The continuous spectrum in quantum mechan-

ics arises from the unboundedness of conﬁgura-
tion space, whereas the MHD essential spectrum
arises from the unboundedness of Fourier space—
there is no minimum wavelength in ideal MHD.
This is an unphysical artifact of the ideal MHD
model because, in reality, low-frequency instabil-
ities with |k⊥| much greater than the inverse of
the ion Larmor radius, ai, cannot exist (where k⊥
is the projection of the local wavevector into the
plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld B).

1

Perhaps the greatest virtue of ideal MHD in fu-
sion plasma physics is its mathematical tractabil-
ity as a ﬁrst-cut model for assessing the stabil-
ity of proposed fusion-relevant experiments with
complicated geometries. For this purpose a sub-
stantial investment in eﬀort has been expended
on developing numerical matrix eigenvalue pro-
grams, such as the three-dimensional (3-D) TERP-
SICHORE [4] and CAS3D [5] codes. These solve
the MHD wave equations for perturbations about
static equilibria, so that the eigenvalue ω2 ≡ −γ2
is real due to the Hermiticity (self-adjointness [6])
of the linearized force and kinetic energy opera-
tors. They use ﬁnite-element or ﬁnite-diﬀerence
methods to convert the inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert-
space eigenvalue problem to an approximating ﬁnite-
dimensional matrix problem.

In order properly to verify the convergence of
these codes in 3-D geometry it is essential to un-
derstand the nature of the spectrum—if it is quantum-
chaotic then convergence of individual eigenvalues
cannot be expected and a statistical description
must be used.

It is the thesis of this paper that the language
of quantum chaos [7] theory indeed provides such
a statistical framework for characterizing MHD
spectra in that it seeks to classify spectra statisti-
cally by determining whether, and to what degree,
they belong to various universality classes.

In the cylindrical case the eigenvalue problem
is separable into three one-dimensional (1-D) eigen-
value problems, with radial, poloidal, and toroidal
(axial) quantum numbers l, m, and n, respec-
It is thus to be expected a priori that
tively.
the spectrum will fall within the standard quan-
tum chaos theory universality class for integrable,
non-chaotic systems [7]. In particular, it is to be
expected that the probability distribution func-
tion for the separation of neighboring eigenvalues
is a Poisson distribution. However, the nature of
the MHD spectrum is quite diﬀerent from that
of the typical quantum, microwave and acoustic
systems normally dealt with in quantum chaos
theory and it is necessary to test this conjecture
by explicit calculation. In fact we ﬁnd that the
result depends on the method of regularization.

We ﬁrst present the eigenvalue equation for a
reduced MHD model of a large-aspect-ratio (eﬀec-
tively cylindrical) stellarator. We study a plasma
in which the Suydam criterion [8] for the stabil-

ity of interchange modes is violated, so the num-
ber of unstable modes tends to inﬁnity as the
small-wavelength cutoﬀ tends to zero. To com-
pute large-m eigenvalues we transform to a Schr¨odinger-
like form of the radial eigenvalue equation [9],
which has essentially the same form in conﬁg-
uration (r) space as in Fourier (kr) space, thus
allowing easy regularization by restricting the kr
domain. To simplify even further we approximate
the eﬀective potential by a parabola, thus yielding
the quantum harmonic oscillator equation, solv-
able in parabolic cylinder functions [10].

Real, ﬁnite-aspect-ratio stellarators are fully 3-
D and their ideal-MHD spectra may be expected
a priori to fall within the universality class ap-
propriate to time-reversible quantum chaotic sys-
tems, where the spectral statistics are found to be
the same as for a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of
random matrices [7] in regions where ray tracing
reveals chaotic dynamics [11]. At the end of this
paper we give a brief report of 3-D calculations
peformed with the CAS3D code on a Mercier-
unstable, high-mirror-ratio, high-iota equilibrium
representing a Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellara-
tor variant [12].

2.One-dimensional model eigenvalue equa-
tion

In this paper we study an eﬀectively circular-
cylindrical MHD equilibrium, using cylindrical co-
ordinates such that the magnetic axis coincides
with the z-axis, made topologically toroidal by
periodic boundary conditions. Thus z and the
toroidal angle ζ are related through ζ ≡ z/R0,
where R0 is the major radius of the toroidal plasma
being modeled by this cylinder. The poloidal
angle θ is the usual geometric cylindrical angle
and the distance r from the magnetic axis labels
the magnetic surfaces (the equilibrium ﬁeld being
trivially integrable in this case). The plasma edge
is at r = a.

In the cylinder there are two ignorable coordi-
nates, θ and ζ, so the components of ξ are com-
pletely factorizable into products of functions of
the independent variables separately. In particu-
lar, we write the r-component as

rξr = exp(imθ) exp(−inζ)ϕ(r) ,

(1)

where the periodic boundary conditions quantize
m and n to integers and we choose to work with

2

the stream function ϕ(r) ≡ rξr(r).

Since the primary motivation of this paper is
stellarator physics, we use the reduced MHD or-
dering for large-aspect stellarators [13, 14], aver-
aging over helical ripple to reduce to an equiva-
lent cylindrical problem [15, 16]. The universality
class should be insensitive to the precise choice of
model as long as it exhibits the behavior typi-
cal of MHD instabilities in a cylindrical plasma,
speciﬁcally the existence of interchange instabili-
ties and the occurrence of accumulation points at
ﬁnite growth rates.

Deﬁning λ ≡ ω2 we seek the spectrum of λ-

values satisfying the scalar equation

Lϕ = λM ϕ

(2)

under the boundary conditions ϕ(0) = 0 at the
magnetic axis and ϕ(1) = 0, appropriate to a per-
fectly conducting wall at the plasma edge (using
units such that r = 1 there).

where G is a Suydam stability parameter (> 1/4
for instability [8]), proportional to the pressure
gradient p′(r) and the average ﬁeld line curvature
[14].

In this paper we use the notation ˙f ≡ rf ′(r)
for an arbitrary function f , so ˙ι- ≡ rdι/dr is a
measure of the magnetic shear and ¨ι- measures the
variation of the shear with radius.

We observe some diﬀerences between Eq. (2)
and the standard quantum mechanical eigenvalue
problem Hψ = Eψ. One is of course the physi-
cal interpretation of the eigenvalue—in quantum
mechanics the eigenvalue E ≡ ¯hω is linear in
the frequency because the Schr¨odinger equation
is ﬁrst order in time, whereas our eigenvalue λ is
quadratic in the frequency because it derives from
a classical equation of motion.

Another diﬀerence is that Eq. (2) is a gener-
alized eigenvalue equation because M is not the
identity operator. This is one reason why it is
necessary to treat the MHD spectrum explicitly
rather than simply assume it is in the same uni-
versality class as standard quantum mechanical
systems.

Figure 1: The rotational transform ι-(r) ≡ 1/q(r)
with ι-0 = 0.45, ι-2 = 0.2. All distinct rational
magnetic surfaces µ = n/m are shown for m up
to 10.

Equation (2) is very similar to the normal mode
equation analyzed in the early work on the inter-
change growth rate in stellarators by Kulsrud [15].
However, unlike this and most other MHD stud-
ies we are concerned not with ﬁnding the highest
growth rate, but in characterizing the complete
set of unstable eigenvalues.

Suydam instabilities occur only for values of
m and n such that n − mι- vanishes. For the 1-D
numerical work in this paper we use a parabolic
transform proﬁle ι- = ι-0 + ι-2r2 as illustrated in
Fig. 1.

Given a rational fraction µ = nµ/mµ in the
interval [ι-(0), ι-(a)] (where nµand mµ are mutu-
ally prime) there is a unique radius rµ such that
ι-(rµ) = µ . Any pair of integers (m, n)µ,ν ≡
(νmµ, νnµ), ν = 1, 2, 3, . . . satisﬁes the resonance
condition

nµ,ν − mµ,νι-(rµ) = 0 .

(4)

We use a broad pressure proﬁle that is suﬃ-
ciently ﬂat near the magnetic axis that the Suy-
dam instability parameter G goes to zero at the
magnetic axis, and for which p′ vanishes at the
plasma edge. The resulting G-proﬁle is shown in
Fig. 2.

Deﬁning a scaled radial variable x ≡ m(r −
rµ)/rµ, we can ﬁnd the large-m spectrum of Eq. (2)
by expanding all quantities in inverse powers of
m, and equating the LHS to zero order by order.
In this paper we work only to lowest order in
1/m, the Suydam approximation. As found by
Kulsrud [15], we have the generalized eigenvalue

with Γ2 ≡ −λ(0)/˙ι-2 and ˙ι- and G evaluated at

r → ±∞, Eq. (5) can be solved to give a square-
integrable eigenfunction, with growth rate γ = ˙ι-Γ,
provided λ(0) < 0 is one of the eigenvalues λµ,l.
The radial mode number l = 0, 1, 2, . . . denotes
the number of nodes of the eigenfunction ϕ(0) =
ϕµ,l(r). Note that λµ,l depends only on µ = n/m
and is otherwise independent of the magnitude of
m and n.

Restricting attention to unstable modes, so that
γ ≡ (−λ)1/2 is real, we transform Eq. (5) to the
Schr¨odinger form [9]

(8)

with η deﬁned through x ≡ γ sinh η/˙ι-(rµ), and
ψ ≡ (cosh η)1/2ϕ(x).

From, e.g., Eq. (4.7) of [9] we see that, pro-
vided the Suydam criterion G > 1/4 is satisﬁed,
there is an inﬁnity of γ eigenvalues accumulating
exponentially toward the origin from above (so

the λ-values accumulate from below) in the limit
l → ∞.

Perhaps less widely appreciated (because m
and n are normally taken to be ﬁxed) is the fact
that there is also a point of accumulation of the
eigenvalues of Eq. (2) at each λµ,l as m → ∞
with l ﬁxed. (Although λ(0) is inﬁnitely degener-
ate, we can break this degeneracy by proceeding
further with the expansion in 1/m, thus showing
that λµ,l is an accumulation point.) Since the ra-
tionals µ are dense on the real line, there is an
“accumulation continuum” [2] between γ = 0 and
the maximum growth rate, γ = γmax.

3.Regularization

The accumulation points of the ideal MHD spec-
trum found above are mathematically interesting
but exist only as a singular limit of equations
containing more physics, including ﬁnite-Larmor-
radius (FLR) eﬀects and dissipation, that regu-
larize the spectrum.

In order to proceed further we need to be ex-
plicit about the nature of this singular limit. As
we are primarily concerned with the universality
class question, we seek only a minimal modiﬁca-
tion of Eq. (2) that has some physical basis but
makes as little change to ideal MHD as possible.
To preserve the Hermitian nature of ideal MHD
we cannot use the drift correction used for esti-
mating FLR stabilization of interchange modes
by Kulsrud [15]. However it is possible to ef-
fect a pseudo-FLR regularization of ideal MHD
by restricting k⊥ to a disk of radius less than the
inverse ion Larmor radius. In our nondimension-
alized, large-aspect ratio model this implies

(k2

θ + k2

r )1/2ρ∗ ≤ 1 ,

(9)

where kr and kθ are the radial and poloidal com-
ponents of the wavevector, respectively, and ρ∗
is the ion Larmor radius (at a typical energy) in
units of the minor radius.

To apply Eq. (9) precisely we need to relate kr
and kθ to the eigenvalue problem discussed above.
From Eq. (1) we see that kθ = m/r. We deﬁne
kr as the Fourier variable conjugate to r. Fourier
transformation of Eq. (2) is only practical in the
large-m limit, when modes are localized near the
resonant surfaces r = rµ, which is why we have
restricted the discussion to leading order in the
1/m expansion.

4

Using the stretched radial coordinate x ≡ m(r−
rµ)/rµ we deﬁne kr ≡ mκ/rµ, where κ is the
Fourier-space independent variable conjugate to
x. With the substitutions d/dx 7→ iκ, x 7→ id/dκ,
and using the fact that κd/dκ and (d/dκ)κ ≡
1 + κd/dκ commute, Eq. (5) transforms to

ϕκ = 0 .

The transformation κ = sinh η then leads back to
Eq. (7), with η now to be interpreted as a dis-
torted Fourier-space independent variable, rather
than as a real-space coordinate!

Equation (9) implies that Eq. (10) is to be

(12)

Analogously to quantum mechanical box-quantization
we use Dirichlet boundary conditions at ±κmax.

4.Spectral statistics in the 1-D case

As only the qualitative nature of the spectrum
is important, we approximate the function Q by
2 Q′′(0)η2, so Eq. (7) can be solved in
Q(0) + 1
parabolic cylinder functions [10]. We ﬁnd the dis-
persion relation

ν + 1

2 =

G − Γ2 − 1
2
(4Γ2 − 1)1/2 ,

(13)

where ν = l in the unregularized case, κmax =
ηmax = ∞. In the even-l, regularized case ν may
be found by solving for a zero of M (ν/2, 1/2, (4Γ2−
1)1/2η2
max/2), where M is Kummer’s function. For
l = 0, ν becomes exponentially small as ηmax →
∞, which allows an approximate regularization
formula to be derived.

We study the spectrum between the maximum
l = 1 growth rate, γmax(l = 1) ≡ maxµ γµ,1,
and the maximum overall growth rate, γmax =
maxµ γµ,0. Only the l = 0 modes exist in this
range of γ, which corresponds to the range in µ
between µmin ≈ 0.522 and µmax ≈ 0.628. Through-
out this range Γ is > 1/2, so that Q has a single
minimum [9] and the quadratic approximation of

this section is appropriate. In this range there are
only four low-order rationals n/m with m < 10.

Taking ρ∗ = 0.001, all pairs of integer values m,
n in the fan-shaped region 1 ≤ m ≤ mmax(n/m),
µmin ≤ n/m ≤ µmax were evaluated, giving an
initial dataset of over 32,000 points (m, n). The
corresponding set of unregularized eigenvalues was
calculated by solving Eq. (13) with ν = 0 and the
eigenvalues were sorted and numbered from the
top to give the integrated density of states “stair-
case” function N (γ).

The curve 0.3523−9.5733×10−11N 2 −1.1625×
10−20N 4 was found to give a good ﬁt to the smoo-
thed behavior of this function. Inverting this func-
tion gives the smoothed function ¯N (γ) which is
used to “unfold” [7] spectra by deﬁning a new
“energy eigenvalue” E ≡ ¯N (γ), such that N (E)
increases linearly on average.

This means that the average separation of eigen-
values is now unity, making comparison with spec-
tra from other physical systems meaningful and
allowing universal behavior to become apparent if
present. However, Fig. 3 shows that the probabil-
ity distribution of eigenvalue spacings s is far from
universal for the unregularized Suydam spectrum,
exhibiting a delta-function-like spike at s = 0.
This is presumably because, although we have
truncated the spectrum in m, we have not re-
moved the degeneracies arising for low-order ra-
tionals µ in the range µmin < µ < µmax.

Figure 4 on the other hand shows that when
a similar procedure is applied to the regularized
spectrum (retaining only regularized eigenvalues

above γmax(l = 1), the universal Poisson distri-
bution expected from a separable system is ob-
tained to a good approximation, thus leading to
the expectation that generic quantum chaos the-
ory is applicable once any physically reasonable
regularization is performed.

Further support for this hypothesis is obtained
from a CAS3D study of a W7-X variant equilib-
rium with a nonmonotonic, low-shear transform
proﬁle (ι-axis = 1.1066, ι-min = 1.0491, ι-edge =
1.0754). As seen from Fig. 5, when the statistics
are analyzed within the three mode families the
eigenvalue spacing distribution function is closer
to the Wigner conjecture form found for generic
chaotic systems [7] than to the Poisson distribu-
tion for separable systems, as might be expected
from [11]. However, when the spectra from the
three uncoupled mode familes are combined, there
are enough accidental degeneracies that the spac-
ing distribution becomes close to Poissonian.

The results from 2.5-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations for the interaction of a picosecond-
long ignition laser pulse with a plasma pellet of 50-µm diameter and 40 critical density are presented.
The high density pellet is surrounded by an underdense corona and is isolated by a vacuum region
from the simulation box boundary. The laser pulse is shown to ﬁlament and create density channels
on the laser-plasma interface. The density channels increase the laser absorption eﬃciency and help
generate an energetic electron distribution with a large angular spread. The combined distribution
of the forward-going energetic electrons and the induced return electrons is marginally unstable to
the current ﬁlament instability. The ions play an important role in neutralizing the space charges
induced by the the temperature disparity between diﬀerent electron groups. No global coalescing
of the current ﬁlaments resulted from the instability is observed, consistent with the observed large
angular spread of the energetic electrons.

INTRODUCTION

The fast ignition concept, ﬁrst proposed more than a decade ago[1], provides a possible alternative path to achieve
ignition in inertial conﬁnement fusion with the potential of reducing drivers energy and increasing gains signiﬁcantly.
In this concept, the ignition is ﬁrst achieved in a small region (L
10 ps
intense ﬂux of MeV electrons. The MeV electrons are produced by the absorption of a petawatt (PW)-class laser
at the edge of the pellet. Recent experimental results in Japan[2] showed 3 orders of magnitude increase of neutron
yield with a 0.5-PW ignition laser and consequently spurred intense new research activities in this area. One of the
research foci is to predict the ignition laser energy needed to ignite a certain target. This energy is determined by a
number of highly nonlinear and dynamic processes such as the laser propagation in the underdense corona, the laser
hole-boring and electron heating near the critical surface, the transport of the energetic electrons in the overdense
plasma, and the subsequent heating of the ignition region by these electrons. No theory exists and simulations and
experiments are the only tools to study these processes.

Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations provide a ﬁrst-principle, detailed description for the plasma region of the pellet,
which comprises the majority of the pellet except for the very dense core (electron density ne > 1023/cm3). Since the
PIC simulations are computationally intensive, currently it is not possible to perform full scale simulations for the
entire pellet. Figure 1 shows the ne and electron temperature (Te) information of a cryogenic target, imploded by a 25-
kJ laser, at its peak compression[3]. The Te information is represented by the plasma parameter (number of electrons
in a Debye cube, nλ3
D) and the ratio of the electron-ion collisionality to the electron plasma frequency, νei/ωpe. In
the region where ne < 1023/cm3, neλ3
D is not
overly large either, which indicates that the discrete particle eﬀects are important. In this region νei/ωpe << 1, which
shows that plasma behavior is not dominated by the collisions. All these make the PIC model the ideal simulation tool
50µm in cross section
for this region. However, even if we were to simulate a plasma slab of 250 µm-long and 50µm

computers with large memory are widely available. Most recent fast ignition PIC simulations used scaled-down targets
with reduced sizes and/or in two-dimension (2D) instead of three-dimension (3D)[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Many of the important
issues, such as hole-boring, laser absorption, and current ﬁlamentation, have been studied.

×

×

However, some key physics depends critically on global electron paths in the target and thus depends on the target
size and the boundary conditions used in the simulations. For example, to absorb 30% of the energy in a 1020W/cm2
laser for 1 ps, the thickness of a plasma slab with ne = 1022/cm3 needs to be 190µm, assuming every electron in
the slab leaves with an energy increase of 1 MeV. However, the laser cannot sweep this distance in 1 ps through
hole-boring. Even if it could, the ion layer formed from electron depletion would pull the electrons back. The actual
absorption is achieved through continuous replenishing of cold electrons from the bulk of the target into a narrow
region in contact with the laser front. If the simulated target is too small and cannot provide enough needed cold
electrons, the MeV electrons may not leave the interaction region and may be heated furthermore to achieve a diﬀerent
distribution.

In this paper we present results from a series of 2.5D (with two space dimensions but all three components of
particle velocities and electromagnetic ﬁelds) PIC simulations with the PIC code OSIRIS[9] in a simulation box of
100λ
100λ with a round target of 51λ diameter. (λ is the laser wavelength and also the basic length unit the
simulations are scaled to.) The setup (Fig.2) allows the simulation of the plasma-vacuum boundary which provides an
important alternative pathway for the MeV electrons. The target consists of a proton-electron plasma with Te = 7.4
keV and Ti = 1 keV. The target has a uniform density core with ne = 40nc within a diameter of 32λ and a coronal
ring with the density linearly decreasing from 40nc to 0 in 9.5λ. Here nc is the critical density which corresponds
1021cm−3 for λ = 1µm. The laser is launched from the left boundary with peak intensities of I = 1020 and
to 1.1
1021(1µm/λ)2W/cm2 and a rise time of 19 laser period, after which the laser amplitude is kept constant. The laser
transverse proﬁle is a Gaussian with a diﬀraction limited spot size of w = 7.5λ. Both s- and p-polarization are used
to infer 3D eﬀects. A typical simulation duration is 309 laser period, which corresponds to about 1 ps for λ = 1µm.

LASER ABSORPTION AND ELECTRON HEATING

As the laser propagates through the short underdense region here and reaches the critical surface, the most prominent
feature observed from the simulations is the ﬁlamentation of the laser accompanied by the rippling of the target
surface (Fig.3). The observed ﬁlament width is roughly an optical wavelength. A laser can ﬁlament due to either
relativistic mass or ponderomotive force eﬀects. For the parameters of the fast ignition, both mechanisms will occur on
timescales that are very short compared to the laser pulse length. Therefore, it is not as important to study the initial
growth phase as it is to understand the eventual nonlinear steady state. The non-relativistic theory of ponderomotive
ﬁlamentation predicts that the mode number with the fastest growth rate increases with plasma density and the
growth rate is higher in the direction perpendicular to the polarization than in the polarization direction[12]. These
conclusions are veriﬁed in Fig.3 which shows that the s-polarized cases (laser electric ﬁeld E out of the simulation
plane) display stronger laser ﬁlamentation than the p-polarized cases (E in the simulation plane). With their higher
intensity the laser ﬁlaments dig density channels at the laser-plasma interface via the ponderomotive force (Fig.3,
right column). These micro density channels in turn focus the laser ﬁlaments like converging waveguides which dig
deeper channels. Therefore, the laser-plasma interface is unstable to any initial transverse modulation of the laser
intensity, which can be viewed as ﬁlamentation in the overdense plasma[13].

3

×

The density channels on the laser-plasma interface can enhance the laser absorption signiﬁcantly. Heating mech-
anisms for normal-incident lasers include the normal coupling of the laser oscillation and the plasma wave at the
B heating[15]. The density channels provide locations where the laser E-ﬁeld can
critical surface[14] and the J
be in the density gradient direction. This provides additional heating mechanisms such as the enhanced resonant
heating[16] and Brunel heating[17]. In our 2.5D simulations, the additional heating mechanisms are present only for
the p-polarization cases. Therefore, we expect that the laser absoprtion is larger in the p-cases than in the s-cases.
Figure 4a shows the laser absorption rate for the electrons, deﬁned as the ratio of the electron kinetic energy increase
to the incoming laser energy within a certain time interval ∆t, η(t) = [KE(t + ∆t)
KE(t)]/(PL∆t), for both s- and
p-polarizations and veriﬁes this conclusion. In addition, the p-cases also show that η increases with time, consistent
with the fact that as the channels becomes deeper these additional heating mechanisms become more eﬃcient. On
the contrary η in the s-case remains almost ﬂat. The absorption does not change signiﬁcantly when the laser intensity
changes from 1020W/cm2 to 1021W/cm2. However, the electron energy composition changes signiﬁcantly (Fig.4b).
In the I = 1021W/cm2 case, more than half of the absorbed laser energy goes to the electrons with energy greater
than 10 MeV. These super-hot electrons may be too energetic to be stopped in the target core and be useful to the
fast ignition. The electron spectrum in the I = 1020W/cm2 cases can be approximated by a power law, which begins
at E

0.2 MeV and falls oﬀ as E−(2−3)[8].

−

The additional heating mechanisms[16, 17] allow the electrons to be accelerated directly in the laser E-ﬁeld direction.
Thus the energetic electrons are expected to to have a large transverse momentum (Py). This can be seen from the
PxPy phase space plot for the electrons localized in front of the laser (Fig.5a). It is also clear from the phase space
plot that the energetic electrons do not form a beam with narrow emittance. The root-mean-square angle in the
xy-plane for the above-1 MeV electrons is plotted in Fig.5b, which also shows the large angular spread for both
1020W/cm2 and 1021W/cm2 cases. The large angular spread is one of the most important characteristics of the
energetic electron distribution in these simulations and must be taken into account in studying their subsequent
transport and in accessing the fast ignition feasibility.

∼

CURRENT FILAMENT INSTABILITY

If left alone, the laser-generated energetic electrons would deposit their energy over a large area when they reach the
dense core region due to their large angular spread. However, the transport of the energetic electrons is not a simple
free-streaming process but a highly nonlinear one during which their interactions with emerging magnetic ﬁelds play
a very important role. For example, we have observed that the laser-heated electrons can generate intense magnetic
n eﬀect[18] on the target surface (not shown here). These magnetic ﬁelds, together with the
ﬁelds through the
surface radial electric ﬁelds, cause a fraction of the energetic electrons to move along the surface through E
B-drift,
which actually prevents the electrons from hitting the simulation box boundary. The motion of the energetic electrons
that are shot forward into the interior of the target is also inﬂuenced by magnetic ﬁelds, only in this case it is the
current ﬁlament instability that provides these ﬁelds.

To properly study the current ﬁlament instability in the fast ignition one needs to add space charge eﬀects due
to temperature disparity between diﬀerent groups of electrons to the standard analysis of Weibel instability[19, 20].
100 MA current carried by the MeV electrons in the fast ignition greatly exceeds the Alfven current limit[21],
The
which is set by the pinching force on the beam electrons from the self-magnetic ﬁeld and is
30 kA for the MeV
electrons. A return current in the background plasma must be induced to neutralize the magnetic ﬁeld of the beam
and render the whole system nearly current neutral. Unlike the previously studied system of two identical counter-
propagating electron clouds[20], the forward energetic electrons have a much higher transverse temperature than the
background plasma electrons carrying the return current. Therefore, the forward current and return current pinch
to diﬀerent degrees when ﬁlamenting and a space charge imbalance will develop. The electric ﬁeld from the space
charge is along the wave vector (or the y
direction here) and resists further ﬁlamenting. The space charge eﬀects
are especially important when the system is in the marginally unstable regime which is the typical case for the fast
ignition simulations here. Furthermore, the ions will respond to the electric ﬁeld and their motion becomes important
in the marginally unstable case where the growth rate is comparable to the ion plasma frequency[8, 22]. With a
totally diﬀerent origin from that in Ref.[23], the space charge eﬀects discussed here exist even when the system is
stable to the two-stream instability.

The detailed analysis of the current ﬁlament instability with the space charge eﬀects is presented in a sep-
arated paper[24]. Here we illustrate the basic space charge eﬀects on the ﬁlament instability by considering a
plasma system with 3 species: one species of hot energetic electrons moving in the +ˆx-direction with a drift-
ˆx-direction with a drifting velocity Vd2,
ing velocity Vd1, another species of cool return electrons moving in the

and q3 the ion charge. Consequently, there is no equilibrium electric or magnetic ﬁeld.

The third term on the right hand side of Eq.4 comes from the oﬀ-diagonal term in Eqs.2-3 that couples the perturba-
tions in ρ and jx and therefore represents the space charge eﬀects. This term is positive deﬁnite, indicating that the
space charges always raise the instability threshold. If the two electron species have the same transverse temperature,
vty1 = vty2, the space charge term vanishes since the current neutrality condition implies P ω2
plVdl = 0. Therefore,
the space charges originate from the temperature disparity between the two electron groups. In general, the space
charge term decreases the growth rate and reduces the range of k of the instability[24].

In the slow growth regime, γ << (m/M )kvty2, the ion response must be considered. Then the instability threshold

Compared to Eq.4, we can see in this marginal instability regime, the growth rate is so small that the ions always
have time to react to cancel any potential space charge. Therefore, the instability threshold is the same as that when
no space charge eﬀect is considered[20].

The actual electron distribution in our PIC simulations (see Fig.5a) cannot be accurately approximated by two
counter-propagating maxwellians. However, the above analysis can be extended for a general electron distribution

in the form of fe0(Px, Py) = P

beamlets. The thresholds in Eqs.4-5 can be modiﬁed with the sum now extended to all N beamlets. We have examined
the electron distributions in two locations in our simulations, one in the shock region and the other in the target interior
(shown by the small boxes in Fig.6a), for their stability property. Speciﬁcally, we plot ω2

basically Eq.5 when vtxl and k are set to zero and ωpI is neglected, for each beamlets in Fig.6c and 6d. A positive

the instability to occur. We found that the shock region is unstable (Fig.6c) but the interior region is stable (Fig.6d).
Furthermore, if the space charge eﬀect is included as in Eq.4 even the shock region becomes stable. Therefore, the
electron distributions in these fast ignition simulations are marginally unstable due to their large angular spread. The
ions play an important role to neutralize any possible space charges. This is also supported by the observation that
the ion density always display the same ﬁlament structure as the electrons. It is also worthwhile to point out that the
return current beamlets (those with negative Pdl) contribute more than the forward beamlets toward the instability
because of their relatively smaller angular spread. Any current ﬁlament stability analysis without considering the role
of the return current would be inaccurate.

Due to dilution of the energetic electron relative density in the interior region, the electrons there are actually
stable to the ﬁlament instability. There the magnetic pinching force cannot overcome the thermal pressure due to
the large transverse momentum spread. The ﬁlament structure observed there is due to the electron streaming from
the ﬁlaments in the shock region. It is therefore no surprise that no global coalescing of these ﬁlaments into a single
strong ﬁlament is observed here (Fig.6b), contrary to the previous simulations with smaller transverse box size[5, 6],
since the coalescing requires that the magnetic pinching force is larger than the thermal pressure. Even without the
300 MG in the
global coalescing the magnetic ﬁeld from the ﬁlament instability is still strong enough (reaching
shock region for 1µm-laser) so that the gyro radius of MeV electrons is less than the laser wavelength. The electrons
are conﬁned by the self-generated magnetic ﬁeld near the laser spot.

∼

The diﬀerence regarding the ﬁlament coalescing embodies the diﬀerence in the electron distributions between
diﬀerent fast ignition simulations. In the simulations, the electron distribution can be aﬀected by a number of factors.
One factor is the total heat capacity of the target, which is determined by the target size and density used in the
simulation. Given the amount of laser energy absorbed, the fraction of energetic electrons in the distribution will
be determined by the heat capacity. The danger of using too small a target lies in that eventually all electrons in
the simulation acquire MeV energy, a situation totally diﬀerent from the actual fast ignition scheme. Another factor
is the recycling of the energetic electrons, which is determined by the target size and the boundary conditions. If
the transverse box size is small and no plasma-vacuum boundary is present, the electrons can recirculate through
the laser spot many times transversely under the periodic boundary condition before they eventually leave in the
longitudinal direction. The plasma-vacuum interface used here combined with the surface magnetic ﬁeld prevents
such transverse recirculation. However, the longitudinal recirculation is still present but occurs later than in a smaller
sized target. Still another factor is the true 2D nature of the simulation aﬀorded by the large transverse size used here.
This allows the realistic simulation of the laser ﬁlaments and density channels which are important for the heating
mechanisms[16, 17] which produce the large angular spread observed here.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper the results from 2.5D PIC simulations for the interaction of a picosecond-long ignition laser pulse with
a plasma pellet of 50-µm diameter and 40-nc are presented. The high density pellet is surrounded by an underdense
corona and is isolated by a vacuum region from the simulation box boundary. The laser pulse is shown to ﬁlament and
create density channels on the laser-plasma interface. The density channels increase the laser absorption eﬃciency and
help generate an energetic electron distribution with a large angular spread. The combined distribution of the forward-
going energetic electrons and the induced return electrons is marginally unstable to the current ﬁlament instability.
The ions play an important role in neutralizing the space charges induced by the the temperature disparity between
diﬀerent electron groups. No global coalescing of the current ﬁlaments resulted from the instability is observed,
consistent with the observed large angular spread of the energetic electrons.

The initial target Te used here is 7.4 keV, which is higher than the actual target bulk Te

1 keV. This Te is chosen
mainly to avoid numerical self-heating[10]. Recently we have implemented a second-order-spline current deposition
scheme in OSIRIS which when combined with the current smoothing allows a grid size of ∆x = 12λD with virtually
no self-heating. We repeat the simulations with Te = 1.1 keV and see no change in the main conclusions presented
here.

≈

While the generation of the energetic electrons is studied here in considerable details, their transport from the birth
place to n = 1023/cm3 needs further study. The highly nonlinear nature of the interaction between the energetic
electrons and emerging magnetic ﬁelds require simulations with targets of
100µm-length and up to 100nc. The
longitudinal recycling of the energetic electrons should also be eliminated through suitable boundary conditions. Only
then can a reliable estimate of the energy ﬂux reaching the n = 1023/cm3 surface be obtained. Fortunately, with the
advance of computer speed and PIC code improvement this type of simulations is within reach now.

∼

For the very dense region of n > 1023/cm3, the collisional eﬀects become important and the electron transport

and its ﬁnal stopping will be aﬀected by collisional scattering[26]. PIC or particle-ﬂuid hybrid type of codes need
to include a proper collision model to correctly simulate the physics there. Eventually the simulations need to be
compared with experiments.

The weakly nonlinear regime of transverse paramagnetic dust grain oscillations in dusty (complex)
plasma crystals is discussed. The nonlinearity, which is related to the sheath electric/magnetic
ﬁeld(s) and to the inter–grain (electrostatic/magnetic dipole) interactions, is shown to lead to the
generation of phase harmonics and, in the case of propagating transverse dust-lattice modes, to the
modulational instability of the carrier wave due to self–interaction. The stability proﬁle depends
explicitly on the form of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the plasma sheath. The long term
evolution of the modulated wave packet, which is described by a nonlinear Schr¨odinger–type equation
(NLSE), may lead to propagating localized envelope structures whose exact forms are presented and
discussed. Explicit suggestions for experimental investigations are put forward.

INTRODUCTION

Dusty (or complex) plasmas (DP) have been attracting
an increasing interest among plasma physicists for more
than a decade due to to the appearance of many novel
phenomena. Of particular importance is the possibility
of the existence of new plasma conﬁgurations (states),
due to the strong intergrain coupling, including the spon-
taneous formation of crystal–like DP structures, when
charged microparticles (dust grains) are trapped in the
sheath region between the electrodes, in plasma discharge
experiments [1, 2]. Such crystals, which are generally
horizontally arranged in a position of equilibrium which is
levitated above the negative electrode in discharge exper-
iments, have been shown to support longitudinal (acous-
tic) as well as transverse (optic-like) oscillation modes
[1].

Force equilibrium in DP crystals is ”traditionally” en-
sured by the sheath electric force which exactly balances
gravity at the levitation height. Crystalline complex
plasma structures have been observed in recent rf dis-
charge experiments [3] in which the plasma sheath was
embedded in an external magnetic ﬁeld. Gravity com-
pensation was thus attributed to magnetic forces, thanks
to the paramagnetic properties of the magnetized dust
grains. Theoretical studies then followed for the inves-
tigation of conditions for magnetic-ﬁeld-assisted crystal
equilibria involving paramagnetic charged dust grains.

The role of various forces acting on paramagnetic grains
has been discussed in Ref.
[4], where magnetic forces
(due to magnetic dipole interactions) have been shown
to prevail over the (weaker) electric polarization forces
(especially under experimental conditions considered in
Ref.
[3], where magnetic ﬁelds as strong as a few thou-
sand Gauss were used). According to these considera-
tions, the properties of transverse magnetized dust lat-
tice (TMDL) oscillations were investigated [5], where
both isolated grain linear oscillatory modes and prop-
agating linear waves were discussed. The dependence of
the dynamics of (linear) grain oscillations on the speciﬁc
characteristics of the (inhomogeneous) magnetic ﬁeld was
studied in detail in Ref. [5], and the possible occurrence
of a linear instability depending on the ﬁeld proﬁle was
pointed out.

It is now established that the investigation of the linear
regime of a dynamical system only unveils part of its dy-
namical proﬁle. Nonlinearity may be present in DP crys-
tal dynamics, either due to intergrain interactions or due
to the sheath environment. In a generic manner, as the
oscillation amplitude becomes large, nonlinearity is ﬁrst
manifested via the generation of wave harmonics leading
to the amplitude modulation of the waves.
Increasing
displacements even further, one may come up with the
formation of localized structures (solitons), which propa-
gate and interact with each other in a remarkably stable
manner, thanks to a compensation between nonlinearity
and dispersion. The present study is devoted to an inves-
tigation of weakly nonlinear eﬀects, with respect to mag-
netized transverse dust-lattice oscillations. Nonlinearity
is explicitly shown to be related to the magnetic and/or
electric ﬁeld proﬁle, as well as to the intergrain electro-
static and/or magnetic (dipole-dipole) interactions. By
using a perturbative approach, the generation of phase
harmonics is elucidated and exact expressions are ob-
tained for the (weak) vertical displacement of the param-
agnetic dust particles. Once these oscillations propagate

in the dusty crystal as a transverse wave, the amplitude
is shown to be potentially unstable to external pertur-
bations, under conditions which depend explicitly on the
magnetic ﬁeld characteristics. Finally, the possible for-
mation of localized envelope excitations is discussed, and
the dependence of these coherent structure characteris-
tics on the plasma parameters is pointed out.

Let us consider the vertical motion of a charged dust
grain (mass M and charge q), subject to an external
static electric and magnetic ﬁeld, E and B respectively,

where we have set z0 = 0. The three terms in the right-
hand side (rhs) of Eq. (1) account for the (sum of the)
electric and magnetic forces, viz. F = Fe + Fm, in the
direction, the force of gravity, and the usual (Ep-
z
stein) damping term, which involves the phenomenolog-
ical damping rate ν due to dust–neutral collisions.

We shall assume a smooth, continuous variation of the
(generally inhomogeneous) ﬁeld intensities E and B, as
well as the grain charge q (which may vary due to charg-
ing processes [6]) near the equilibrium position z0 = 0.

the generation of frequency harmonics once the oscilla-

phenomenon has already been studied for an unmagne-

back from experiments is available.

Eq. (8) in Ref.
counts for the external force ﬁelds in the sheath region
(i.e. essentially Φ as deﬁned in (2) above); nevertheless,
in a more sophisticated description, Φext may include
the parabolic horizontal conﬁnement potential imposed
in experiments for stability [10], or the initial laser ex-
citation triggering the oscillations in experiments (both
neglected here).

Notice, in passing, that the vertical motion equation of
the recent nonlinear model by Ivlev et al. [11] is exactly
recovered in the appropriate limit [12].

In general (i.e.

regardless of the particular analyti-
cal aspects of each model), one immediately notices that
nonlinearity may either arise from the sheath environ-
ment (electric/magnetic ﬁelds) or from the interactions
between the paramagnetic dust grains.

Adopting the standard continuum approximation, of-
ten employed in solid state physics [13], we may assume
that only small displacement variations occur between

very low k, i.e. cancelling terms in k4 in (12)), and Eq.
(10) in [17] (where a quasi-continuum approximation was
adopted, i.e. a continuum envelope but discrete carrier
wave desciption). Notice however that inter-grain inter-
action nonlinearity was neglected in those studies (i.e.
K3 = 0 therein).

priate to cast Eq. (16) in a non-dimensional form, for
physical clarity. This is readily done by introducing a
set of appropriately chosen scales, e.g. the lattice con-
stant r0 and the inverse eigenfrequency ω−1
g , i.e. by scal-
X ′ = X/r0
ing the (slow) variables X and T as X
T ′ = ωgT ; the vertical displacement ampli-
and T

A′ = A/r0. The form of Eq. (16)
tude becomes A
is then exactly recovered upon substituting with: Eq.

a. Modulational instability.

In a generic manner, a
modulated wave whose amplitude obeys the NLS equa-
tion (16) is stable/unstable to perturbations if the prod-
uct P Q is negative/positive. To see this, one may
ﬁrst check that the NLSE is satisﬁed by the monochro-
matic solution (Stokes’ wave) A(X, T ) = A0 eiQ|A0|

which exhibits a purely growing mode if κ

. The growth rate attains a maximum

value γmax = Q
Benjamin-Feir instability [15]. For P Q < 0, the wave is
modulationally stable, as evident from (19).

Notice that the coeﬃcient P is negative, given the
quasi-inverse-parabolic form of the dispersion curve ω(k)
for low k. One therefore only needs to deduce the sign of
Q, given by (18), in order to determine the stability pro-
ﬁle of the TDL oscillations. In fact, given the deﬁnitions
(5, 9) of the parameters ωg, K1, K2 and K3, one may eas-
ily derive an expression for Q in terms of the (derivatives
of the) potentials Φ(z) (for the sheath) and U (z) (for
inter-grain interactions). The exact form of the poten-
tial Φ(z) (hence the coeﬃcients Φ(j), j = 1, 2, ...) may be
obtained from ab initio calculations or by experimental
data ﬁtting. As mentioned above, some evidence for the
numerical values of the coeﬃcients Φ(j), yet only in the
absence of the magnetic ﬁeld, can be found in Ref.
[8],
where the dust grain potential energy was reconstructed
from experimental data (see Eq. (9) therein); those val-
ues (cf. comment above) seem to suggest that the value
of Q for low wavenumbers k is positive, as may be read-
ily checked from (18). Therefore, under the experimen-
tal conditions described in Ref. [8], the TDL wave would
propagate as a stable wave, for large wavelength values λ.
However, for shorter wavelengths, either the coeﬃcient
P = ω′′(k)/2 or Q may change sign, and the TDL wave
may thus be potentially unstable. These results should a
priori be checked by appropriately designed experiments,
in particular with regard to magnetically levitated DP
crystals.

b. Localized excitations. A ﬁnal comment concerns
the possibility of the existence of localized excitations
related to TMDL waves.
It is known that the NLSE
(16) admits localized solutions (envelope solitons) of the
bright (P Q > 0) or dark/grey (P Q < 0) type. These
expressions are found by inserting the trial function A =
A0 exp(iΘ) in Eq.
(16) and then separating real and
imaginary parts in order to determine the (real) functions
A0(X, T ) and Θ(X, T ). Details on the derivation of their
analytic form can be found e.g. in Refs. [19, 20], so only
the ﬁnal expressions will be given in the following. Let
us retain that this ansatz amounts to a total (vertical)
grain displacement u(x, t) essentially equal to:

u(x, t) = ǫρ cos(kx

they correspond to an inﬁnite energy stored in the lat-
tice. Nevertheless, their existence locally in a ﬁnite–sized
chain may be considered (and possibly conﬁrmed) either
numerically or experimentally.

It may be stressed that the grain displacement cor-
responding to the (envelope) excitations presented here
is intrinsically diﬀerent in form (and obeys diﬀer-
ent physics) from the pulse-like small-amplitude local-
ized structures (solitons) typically found via Korteweg-
DeVries (KdV) theories; see Refs.
[19, 20] for a critical
comparison.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The present study has been devoted to an investigation
of amplitude modulation eﬀects associated with either
isolated transverse dust-grain oscillations or propagating
transverse dust–lattice waves in DP crystals of param-
agnetic charged dust particles, embedded in an external
magnetic ﬁeld. We have shown that nonlinearity comes
into play once the oscillation amplitude slightly departs
from the weak–displacement (linear) regime. This non-
linearity, which is related to the electric and/magnetic
ﬁeld(s) in the sheath region, aﬀects the dynamics of
transverse dust lattice oscillations via the generation of
phase harmonics and the potential instability of the car-
rier wave, due to self-interaction. The latter may presum-
ably be responsible for energy localization in the DP crys-
tal via the formation of localized envelope excitations.
Analytic expressions for these excitations are presented
and brieﬂy discussed. It should be stressed that the in-
stability suggested here, related to self-modulation of the
carrier wave and triggered once the amplitude becomes
slightly important, is completely independent from the
one pointed out in Ref. [5], which is related to the values
of the intrinsic parameters (the gap frequency, in partic-
ular) involved in the physics of the problem.

where ve is the envelope velocity; L and Ω represent the
pulse’s spatial width and oscillation frequency, respec-
tively. In our problem, the bright-type localized envelope
solutions may occur and propagate in the lattice if a suf-
ﬁciently short wavelength is chosen, so that the product
P Q is positive. We note that the pulse width L and the
amplitude A0 satisfy LA0 = (2P/Q)1/2 = const.. Let
us point out that, when the pulse’s spatial width L is
comparable in order of magnitude to the carrier wave-
length λ, this (now highly localized) type of solution is
similar in structure to the (odd-parity) discrete breather
(DB) modes (or intrinsic localized modes, ILMs) recently
widely studied in molecular chains [21].

We should admit, for rigor, that the latter excitations

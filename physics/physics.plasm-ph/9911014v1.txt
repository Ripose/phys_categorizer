Second virial coeﬃcient for the Landau diamagnetism of a two component plasma

M.Steinberg, W. Ebeling, and J. Ortner
(February 2, 2008)

This paper investigates the density expansion of the thermodynamic properties of a two com-
ponent plasma under the inﬂuence of a weak constant uniform magnetic ﬁeld. We start with the
fugacity expansion for the Helmholtz free energy. The leading terms with respect to the density
are calculated by a perturbation expansion with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld. We ﬁnd a new mag-
netic virial function for a low density plasma which is exact in quadratic order with respect to the
magnetic ﬁeld. Using these results we compute the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility.

I. INTRODUCTION

The topic of matter in magnetic ﬁelds has received much attention. The magnetic ﬁeld has a great eﬀect on the
individual motion of charged particles. In classical mechanics the motion of the free particles in a magnetic ﬁeld can
be described by circular orbits. The frequency associated with the rotation is the cyclotron frequency ωc = eB0/me.
In quantum mechanics the motion perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld is quantized with the corresponding energy
eigenvalues E⊥ = ¯hωc(n + 1/2) [1]. A wide range of subsequent investigations covers the properties of atoms and
molecules in magnetic ﬁelds. Their study is motivated by the astrophysical implications concerned with the physics of
pulsars and neutron stars, but also by its application in quantum chaos [2–4]. The calculation of the energy spectrum
of a hydrogen atom in strong magnetic ﬁelds has been tackled by various authors [5–7]. One of the complications
found in the theory is the coupling of the center of mass motion with the relative motion [6]. This also complicates
the calculation of the thermodynamic functions of a low density plasma. However, this eﬀect becomes important
at strong ﬁelds only. Throughout this paper we will consider the weak-ﬁeld limit in which case this eﬀect becomes
negligible. In this limit the proton mass is considered to be inﬁnite.

Although the magnetic ﬁeld aﬀects the individual motion of the particles, there is no inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld
on the equilibrium properties of a classical charged particle system. This follows from the Bohr-van-Leeuwen theorem
[8,9], which can be easily derived by changing the variable in the momentum integrals in such a way that one works
eA. As a result of this all equilibrium properties are independent of the magnetic ﬁeld. In
with the variable π = p
quantum mechanics this argument is no longer valid, since the momentum operator and the coordinate operator of
a particle do not commute. A common example of an equilibrium value which depends on the magnetic ﬁeld is the
magnetization of an electron gas. It was shown by Landau [10] that the low ﬁeld magnetization of a spinless electron
gas, in Boltzmann statistics, is

−

,

−

(1)

i.e., the so called orbital part contributes to a diamagnetic response. However, the full response of the free (noninter-
acting) electron gas, including the spin part, is paramagnetic.

The magnetization of a system of charged particles is a boundary eﬀect. In classical mechanics the magnetization
induced by the motion of the bulk electrons is cancelled by the magnetization connected with the surface current.
Again in quantum mechanics this statement is not valid anymore. Landau used a perturbation expansion of the
free energy with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld, to circumvent diﬃculties due to the boundary eﬀects. In doing so
the electrons at the boundary of the system were neglected. Then the magnetization is found as the derivative of
the free energy with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld. Another approach has been chosen by Teller [11]. He calculated
the current at the boundary of the system, produced by the motion of the elctrons under the inﬂuence of uniform
magnetic ﬁeld. From this he computed the magnetization of the system and was able to show the equivalence of his
method and Landau’s approach. However, as Teller already pointed out Landau’s method is much better suited for
more complicated problems.

The diﬃculties connected with the boundary eﬀects are perhaps one of the reasons for the few results concerning the
equilibrium statistical mechanics of a low density quantum plasmas embedded in an external magnetic ﬁeld. A ﬁrst
attempt beyond Landau has been pursued by Alastuey and Jancovici. They studied, by means of a Wigner-Kirkwood
expansion, the magnetic properties of a nearly classical one component plasma (OCP) in two and three dimensions
in the weak ﬁeld [12] as well as in the strong ﬁeld limit [13]. Related problems were treated by Cornu [14] and Boose

1

and Perez [15] who derived a formally exact virial expansion of the EOS of a multicomponent plasma by using the
Feynman Kac path-integral representation of the grand-canonical ensemble.

This paper is aimed to calculate the magnetic properties of a quantum plasma in the low density limit. These

systems are characterized by a small coupling parameter Γ, which is given by

Γ =

e2
4πǫ0kT d

,

where d = (3/4πn)1/3 is the mean distance between the particles. We follow the method of Landau for the calculation
of the magnetization. The starting point is the fugacity expansion of the Helmholtz free energy. In a previous work
[16] the authors have performed a perturbation expansion for the equation of state of a low density plasma up to
the order n2e4, which is valid at arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld strength. In the present paper we perform an expansion
of the thermodynamic functions for a low density plasma (Γ < 1) up to the order n2 and calculate the coeﬃcients
of this expansion in quadratic order with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld, without making any approximation with
respect to the Coulomb problem. Using a diagrammatic language this can be restated as the calculation of all ladder
diagrams expanded to second order in the magnetic ﬁeld. In doing so we will consider the B and B2 terms of the
Hamiltonion separately. We will see that the separate contributions are divergent, only the sum of all contributions
give a convergent expression. This is the price which we have to pay within the present method circumventing the
calculation of boundary eﬀects.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we discuss the representation of thermodynamic functions by a
fugacity expansion. The second virial coeﬃcient of a magnetized plasma will be discussed in section III. In the ﬁrst
part of section III, we present in more detail the calculation of the electron-ion contribution to the thermodynamic
functions in the case of an inﬁnite proton mass and in the second part an analytical continuation will lead us to the
electron-electron contribution. In the third part of section III the asymptotic behavior of the new proposed magnetic
virial functions will be studied. Finally, the derived results are used to compute the magnetization and the magnetic
susceptibility in section IV.

II. REPRESENTATION OF THE THERMODYNAMIC FUNCTIONS BY A FUGACITY EXPANSION

In this section, we brieﬂy present the general method used in this work and give the exact results derived in an
earlier work [16]. Let us consider a two-component charge-symmetrical system of N spin half particles of charge (-e)
and mass me and N spin half particles of charge e and mass mi. The Hamiltonoperator of our system consists of two
particle contributions. Each pair of species a and b contributes

in the grand canonical ensemble. The squared inverse Debye radius is given by κ2 = β(e2/ǫ0)(˜ze + ˜zi). Since it is a
classical contribution the Debye term does not depend on the ﬁeld. In the limit of small densities Eq.(7) coincides
with the formally exact virial equation of state derived by Cornu [14] and Boose and Perez [15]. We now try to extend
these calculations and focus on the calculation of the second virial coeﬃcient Bab. In order to avoid convergence
problems let us in a ﬁrst approach cut the Coulomb tail at large distances, i.e. Vab(r) = 0 if r > R. Then the second

III. SECOND VIRIAL COEFFICIENT OF A MAGNETIZED PLASMA

It is convenient to divide the second virial coeﬃcient into the direct part Bd

ab and the exchange part Bex
aa

and to compute them separately. The exchange part of Bab as deﬁned by Eqs.(9) with the Hamiltonoperator given
by Eq.(3) is convergent while if R
the direct part is divergent. This is due to the long range behavior of the
Coulomb interaction which leads to collective eﬀects. In order to include these collective eﬀects one has to perform a
screening procedure, which may then lead to convergent expression for Bab. Such a technique is well established in
the zero magnetic ﬁeld case [17–21] and can be easily extended to the nonzero magnetic ﬁeld case. In general, Bab is
an analytic function of the interaction parameter ξab [21], deﬁned by

→ ∞

with λab = ¯h/√2mabkT and mab = mamb/(ma + mb) beeing the eﬀective mass. Hence Bab may be written as a
Taylor expansion. Using the methods as described in [17–21] we derived in our earlier work [16] the lowest order
contribution to Bab. As in the zero ﬁeld case we write the direct part of the second virial coeﬃcient of the plasma in
the following form

Therefore in the zero magnetic ﬁeld case an exact calculation of the convergent second virial coeﬃcient is possible in
agreement with earlier work [20,21].

An alternative expression for the ﬁeld free virial coeﬃcient which we may refer to as B0

A. Expansion in the weak ﬁeld limit for the ion-electron interaction

We shall ﬁnd an expansion of the second virial coeﬃcient in the weak-ﬁeld limit. The magnetic ﬁeld is now assumed
to be a small perturbation to the ﬁeld free Coulomb problem. In this case we can use the already established results
for the second virial coeﬃcient in the absence of a ﬁeld [21]. Due to the invariance of the thermodynamic functions
under the transformation B
B the ﬁrst correction to the ﬁeld-free results will be quadratic in the magnetic ﬁeld.
This can also be veriﬁed in the ideal contribution (Pauli spin magnetism and Landau diamagnetism).
Let us consider a hydrogen plasma with an inﬁnite proton mass. This is a reasonable approximation in the weak
ﬁeld limit, as the proton frequency is proportional to the inverse mass of the proton. We chose the symmetric gauge
A = 1/2 (B

We are interested in the case of a weak magnetic ﬁeld without making any approximation with respect to the Coulomb

zero and the ﬁrst nonvanishing term is proportional to x2

e. This contribution may be written as

The ﬁrst term comes from the expansion of the normalising constant and therefore the trace is solely given by the zero

Here the sum runs from k = 6, since in this derivation the lower order terms k < 6 would give divergent contributions .
However, formally the ζ function can be extended to negative values and therefore the sum to smaller k values such as
k = 2, 3, 4, and 5. It will be shown below that this extension is possible and gives the exact lower order contributions.
Note that the bound state contribution and the scattering state contribution diﬀer by a factor of 2. This general
statement has been previously derived in the zero ﬁeld case [20]. It is essentially a consequence of the analyticity
of the second virial coeﬃcient Bab(ξ) and expresses the fact of compensation of bound state and scattering state
contributions according to Levinsons Theorem [20]. One may also regard it as rule of obtaining scattering quantities
from bound state quantities. We will employ this relation in the following section.

Again we ﬁrst concentrate on the calculation of the bound state contribution. We may use the eigenfunction of the

3. Final results for the electron-ion contribution

Now we shall calculate the scattering part. This contribution may be obtained by applying the same arguments that
have led to the ﬁnal expression of B1

ab.

As before we expand the exponential, introduce the ζ-function and obtain the following expression for the bound state
contribution

We can now take the sum of the various contributions Eqs.(31, 45 and 51) in order to obtain the quantum virial

We ﬁrst study the Hamilton operator in c.m. and relative coordinates. In this case the hamiltonian is separable

and may be written as Hee = H cm

ee + hee, with the center of mass hamiltonian

It describes the free motion of a particle with mass 2me parallel to the ﬁeld. While we have an harmonic oscillator
with frequency ωc = eB/me perpendicular to the ﬁeld. The hamiltonian for the relative motion is given by

It has the same structure as the hamiltonian for the relative motion of an electron in the ﬁeld of a proton with inﬁnite
mass. The only diﬀerence is the appearance of diﬀerent masses in the various terms of hei and hee. However, by
appropriately redeﬁning the length scales and dimensionless parameters involved in the problem, one can map hee
onto hei. This means in detail the replacement of λe by λee and of ξe by ξee in Eq.(52,53). Now we may use the
analyticity of the virial coeﬃcient with respect to the interaction parameter. We may extend the result obtained for
the electron-ion part Eq.(53) by analytical continuation to negative ξ-values. Thus we have for the electron-electron
contribution

The magnetic quantum virial function QB(ξee) is given by Eq.(53). Note that this series holds also for the ion-ion
interaction if me is substituted by mi. However its contribution to the virial coeﬃcient is negligible in the weak ﬁeld
limit.

Let us brieﬂy state the result for the exchange part of the electron-electron contribution.

The factor cosh(2xe)/ cosh2(xe) in Eq.(58) is a result of the spins of the particles and can be calculated exactly. Again,
one may check these results for the order k = 0, 1 by comparison with the exact contributions given by Eqs.(24 and
25).

C. Asymptotic properties of the virial function

Let us now make an independent test of the above made statements. This investigation relies on two facts. First we
the quantum virial function QB(ξ) should be
consider the elctron-electron contribution only, then in the limit ξ
−1. That means in this limit the plasma behaves essentially
equal to the Wigner-Kirkwood expansion [12], since ξ
as a classical system. The second argument is that the electron-electron contribution may be obtained from the ion-
electron contribution, and vice versa, by simple replacements of the interaction parameter as discussed in the previous
section. Let us start by studying the higher order contributions k
6 to the magnetic virial function (truncated virial
function), which read according to Eq.(53) as

Remarkably, this procedure is accompanied by a term by term cancellation of the lower order contributions k < 6
coming from the Taylor expansion with those coming from the asymptotic expansion. The ﬁnal expression may now
be compared with the ¯h2 expansion , which was computed by Alastuey and Jancovici [12]. The linear term in the
asymptotic expansion of QB(ξ) is the term proportional to ¯h2-term of the Wigner Kirkwood expansion and coincides
with that of Alastuey and Jancovici. In addition to that we have found higher order contributions proportional to ¯h4
and ¯h6. With this derivation we have shown that that the magnetic virial function (53) has the correct asymptotic
properties. This may be regarded as a strong support of the argument that the sum in Eq.(59) can be extended to
the values of k=2,3,4, and 5, in order to obtain the desired result as given in Eq.(53).

Notice that from the Wigner-Kirkwood expansion follows the absence of the linear term in the Taylor expansion

(53).

Now let us brieﬂy summarize the properties of the magnetic quantum virial function. In Fig.1 we have plotted QB(ξ)
for both positive and negative arguments, i.e. for electron-ion and electron-electron interaction , respectively. It shows
an asymmetric behavior. For opposite charged particles the magnetic quantum virial function increases exponentially
at large ξ, i.e. at low temperatures, due to the formation of bound states. While for like charged QB(ξ) increases
linear at large ξ.
The behavior of the exchange magnetic virial function is shown in Fig.2. In the quantum regime, at small ξ, one ﬁnds
a ﬁnite contribution to the thermodynamic funcitons. While EB(ξ) decreases exponentially in the classical regime,
i.e. at large ξ-values. This result was also found in [12].

IV. MAGNETIZATION AND MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY

We now compute the magnetization in linear approximation (weak-ﬁeld limit) and construct from this the mag-
netic susceptibility. Thereby spin eﬀects and orbital eﬀects are treated on equal footing. Let us suppose that the
magnetization may be divided into ideal and interaction contributions

We restrict ourselves to the magnetization of the electronic subsystem, since the magnetization of the subsystem of
the heavy positive ions is negligible small. However the contribution of the electron-ion interaction is fully included
into our calculation. The ideal magnetization M =

(1/Ω)(∂F/∂B) may be calculated from

Evaluating this in the weak ﬁeld limit, we get Landau’s result for the sum of the spin magnetism and the diamagnetism,
which reads

The interaction part of the magnetization may be expressed in terms of the magnetic virial function. By taking the
derivative of the full second virial coeﬃcient with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld one obtains

The ﬁrst term is Landau’s result for the magnetic susceptibility, χL = (1/6)(n¯h2e2β/m2
e), of an ideal system in
Boltzmann statistics, while the next terms describe the density eﬀects. These eﬀects contain the interaction of
the particles as well as the deviation from the Boltzmann statistics. Fig.3 shows the magnetic susceptibility as a
function of the density parameter nλ3
ee of the system for various temperatures. In Fig.4 we have plotted the magnetic
susceptibility as a function of the inverse temperature for various ﬁxed densities. We ﬁnd for ξee < 1.2 a decrease
and for ξee > 1.2 an increase of the paramagnetic susceptibility. The transition from negative to positive corrections
105K. This non-monontonic dependence on the temperature is the result of two competiting eﬀects.
occurs at T
The ﬁrst eﬀect can be explained on the basis of an ideal quantum plasma. The exchange contribution of the order
n2, which describes the ﬁrst deviation from the Boltzmann statistics, decreases the magnetic susceptibility. On the
other hand, the interaction between the particles tends to increase the magnetic susceptibility. This eﬀect becomes
dominant at low temperatures, while at high temperatures the exchange eﬀects are dominant.

We note that for ξ

105K, the contribution from the positive interaction parameter (ξ > 0) may
become very large due to its exponentiell increase with 1/T . The region where a considerable number of bound states
/χL < 1
are formed, requires a special treatment [20]. Clearly, this theory is restricted to the region in which
is valid.

Finally, we mention that the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of an OCP can be derived from the results
of the TCP (74,75). This limit is obtained by sending the mass of one species to inﬁnity and the charge to zero while
ensuring charge neutrality of the system. Then the magnetic susceptibility of an OCP in linear response reads

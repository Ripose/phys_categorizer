The reported observations [1] of new emission lines in the helium-hydrogen (98-2 %)

plasmas have been given a simple explanation in [2] . The reported observations show sharp

emission lines with the energies satisfying empirical relations given by

Ee = 13.6n eV

where n = 1, 2, 3, 7, 9

Ee = 13.6n − 21.21 eV

where n = 4, 6, 8

Let us note that the ground state energy level of hydrogen is -13.6 eV, and this immediately

hints at intriguing physics if the observations are correct. In view of the doubtful nature of

’exotic’ observations in recent years in the so-called cutting-edge research,we must be skep-

tical of this report unless independent experiments by other groups verify the observations.

Assuming the correctness of the reported emission lines, let us see if Sathyamurthy [2] oﬀers

any explanation. He says that, ’if there are several H atom recombinations taking place

simultaneously, under favourable circumstances, there could be emissions corresponding to

integral multiples of 13.6 eV..’ Obviously this does not amount to any physical interpreta-

tion, and one does not know what it means to say ’several atom recombinations’.

Is there some possible mechanism to explain the observations if these are true? Let us

explore the hypothesis of photonic de Broglie waves [3] in this context. Jacobson et al in

[3] propose that an ensemble of photons in quantum optics could be considered as a Bose

condensate with de Broglie wavelength λ/N where λ is the wavelength, and N the average

number of the constituent photons. To give a simple derivation,let us consider N photons

with frequency ν ,then the total energy Nhν can be used to obtain the momentum of the

condensate

The de Broglie wavelength is

The idea that N photons with frequency ν could behave as a single entity with frequency

Nν seems strange,and in the literature counterintuitiveness of quantum mechanics is in-

voked.Experiments on biphoton interference and quantum entanglement have been of active

areas of research besides the geometrical phases for such photon pairs [4].

Let us assume that helium is instrumental in creating cavities where photonic conden-

sates could form for the photons with energy 13.6 eV. One could then explain relation(1).

Following our work on geometrical phase [4] we argue that spin plays an important role

in the condensate i.e. even numbers give spinless state and odd number of photons give

spin one state.The diﬀerence between relations (1) and (2) is that in the former we have

odd n (excepting 2) while in (2) it is even. Here Sathyamurthy’s suggestion that photon

condensate gets inelastically scattered from helium seems useful. He conﬁnes only to energy

conservation,however the angular momentum and parity selection rules have to be properly

incorporated in a fuller discussion.

If the condensate mechanism is correct one can look for its veriﬁcation using the Mach-

Zehnder interferometer as is proposed by Ryﬀ and Ribeiro in [4].Here the source beam should

be the emission radiation from the plasma,and the interference pattern has to be contrasted

with the independent source at this frequency.

Obviously the idea of photonic de Broglie waves is speculative,and in spite of intense work

in quantum optics the problems at fundamental level lack understanding. A radically new

approach envisages photon as a composite structure and a number of photons could coalesce

to create photo-balls that behave as photons [5]. This approach also desreves attention.

Results of quasi-classical molecular dynamics simulations of the quantum electron gas are re-
ported. Quantum eﬀects corresponding to the Pauli and the Heisenberg principle are modeled by
an eﬀective momentum-dependent Hamiltonian. The velocity autocorrelation functions and the
dynamic structure factors have been computed. A comparison with theoretical predictions was per-
formed.

I. INTRODUCTIONS

A gas of interacting electrons imbedded in a uniform positive background is a basic theoretical model. Degeneracy
(i.e. the inﬂuence of the Fermi statistics) and coupling (the role of interactions due to Coulomb forces) are important
features of the electron plasma. The electron gas is characterized by 2 parameters - the density n and the temperature
2m (3π2n)2/3 being the Fermi energy, describes the
T (in energy units). The dimensionless parameter θ = T
degeneracy of the electron system. The coupling constant of the electron plasma can be deﬁned as the ratio of the
average Coulomb energy to the average kinetic energy,

For a strongly degenerate electron gas (θ

where rS = a/aB is the Wigner-Seitz radius of the electron system in units of the Bohr radius.

Important informations on the properties of the electron gas can be obtained from the knowledge of the dielec-
tric function and the dynamic structure factor. The plasma dispersion relation, static correlation functions, and
thermodynamic potentials can all be obtained from these functions.

For a weakly coupled plasma (γ

for very high electron densities or vice versa at very small densities
and suﬃcient high temperature) the random phase approximation (RPA) [1,2] gives good results in calculating the
dielectric function because the kinetic energy is dominant.

≪

On the contrary, for electron densities corresponding to the conduction band density in real metals the average
kinetic and potential energies of the electrons are of the same order of magnitude, and the plasma is so to say moderate
coupled (γ
1). The microscopic dynamics of electrons in such plasmas are dominated by collisions and the non-
collisional RPA becomes inapplicable. Exchange and correlation corrections to the RPA cannot be calculated exactly,
but a number of approximate expressions of the dielectric function have been suggested [3].

In order to check the validity of the diﬀerent approaches microscopic simulations of the electron gas are of great

interest. Classical simulations of the one component plasma were performed by Hansen et al. [4].

The aim of this paper is to report the results of a series of quasi-classical molecular dynamics simulations on
the dynamic properties of the electron gas. The thermodynamic properties (mean energy) of the electron gas were
investigated in a previous paper [5].

II. THE MODEL

In order to treat the quantum electron gas by quasi-classical simulations we make use of eﬀective pair potentials.
Purely space-dependent eﬀective potentials can be derived from the quantum-mechanical Slater sum [6,7] . At short
distances these potentials diﬀer from the bare Coulomb potential and remain ﬁnite. On the basis of such potentials
Norman and Valuev [8] and Hansen and Mc Donalds [9] performed molecular dynamics simulations of an electron-
proton plasma.

Another way to include quantum diﬀraction eﬀects (i.e. the Heisenberg principle) into the dynamics is to blow up
the phase space by introducing additional ”quantum” degrees of freedom. This is done in the wave-packet dynamics
developed to describe nuclear collisions [10–13]. However, this method leads to diﬃculties in describing thermal
equilibrium properties of many particle systems [14].

We use therefore in our calculations the ordinary 6N dimensional phase space, the particles interacting by eﬀective
pair potentials. However, a pseudopotential depending only on the space coordinates leads necessarily to the Maxwell
momentum distribution. To model the momentum distribution of an electron gas governed by Fermi statistics we
include in our simulations momentum-dependent interaction terms. We thus follows a line developed by a series of
authors as e.g. Wilets and Kirschbaum, Dorso et. al. [15–18].

In our simulations we substitute the quantum dynamics of the electron system by a phase space dynamics of

Hamilton type with eﬀective quasi classical Hamiltonian [5]

The last term in the eﬀective Hamiltonian is the Coulomb interaction averaged with respect to the two particle

The simulations based on the Hamiltonian Eq. (5) with the parameters deﬁned by Eq. (9) result in a mean energy

proved to be in good agreement with Quantum Monte Carlo simulations and with Pade approximations [5].

That is the reason why we expand our considerations to the investigation of the dynamic properties of the electron

gas within the developed approach.

In restricting our calculations to a simple Hamiltonian given by Eq. (5) we make use from the fact that the collective
dynamics of the electron system are dictated primiraly by the long range character of the Coulomb potential and are
widely unaﬀected by the simpliﬁcations in the short range part of the eﬀective potentials made in Eqs. (6) and (7).

A closely related quality is the dielectric function ε(~k, ω) of the electron system. It describes the linear response
of the plasma to an external electric ﬁeld and is connected to the dynamic structure factor via the ﬂuctuation -
dissipation theorem (FDT),

where φ(k) = 4πe2/k2

,

β = 1/T .

The imaginary part of the dielectric function is antysymmetric with respect to the frequency. Note that from Eq.

(12) it follows that the dynamic structure factor does not possess symmetry, but satisﬁes the relation

The dynamic structure factor deﬁned by Eqs. (11) and (10) is directly measurable in the MD simulations if one
identiﬁes the Heisenberg operator ~ri(t) with the position of the i-th particle in our simulations.

However, the thus obtained quantity (we denote it by R(~k, ω)) possesses symmetry. It corresponds therefore to a

classical FDT,

R(~k, ω) = (nπφ(k)βω)

−1 Im ε

−1(~k, ω)

.

From Eq. (14) one concludes that R(~k, ω) can be regarded as a normalized loss function.

In what follows we will regard the normalized loss function. Note, that in the classical case the loss function and

the dynamic structure factor coincide.

In our molecular dynamic simulations we used the algorithm of Verlet [19] to integrate numerically the equations
of motions obtained from the eﬀective Hamiltonian of a system of 256 electrons. The typical length of the MD runs
were about 103ω−1
p

(ωp being the plasma frequency).

The equilibrization phase was replaced by a Monte Carlo Simulation using the algorithm of Metropolis [20].
The forces were calculated by an Ewald method in order to account for the long range of the Coulomb interaction

[21].

The motion of the electrons can be studied by calculating the velocity autocorrelation function < v(t + τ )v(t) >t.
We see (Fig.1) that for Γ = 1 the velocity autocorrelation falls monotonically to zero , whereas for Γ = 100 the decay
of the velocity ACF is characterized by appearance of oscillations with a frequency close to the plasma frequency.
That means that the motion of a single electron is coupled to the collective density ﬂuctuations.
The collective motion is described by the dynamic structure factor (or the loss function). R(q, ω) (q = ka) is plotted
for two q values, at Γ = 1 for diﬀerent θ = 1 (moderate degenerate) and θ = 50 (classical) and for Γ = 100 at θ = 50
(strongly coupled, classical electron gas)(Figs.2-4). The results of the simulations are compared with theoretical
predictions from RPA. At moderate coupling constants (Γ = 1) the plasmon peak of the loss function is less than that
predicted by RPA and slightly shifted to the left(Figs.2,3). In both cases the plasmon peak can be observed only for
the smallest q value. The change of θ in the range from 50 to 1 has only small inﬂuence on the results (Fig.5).

3

In the strong coupling regime Γ = 100 the observed plasmon peak at the smallest q value is extremly sharp and
centered close to ωP (Fig.4). A well deﬁned collective plasmon mode has been developed. At a q value 3 times larger
the plasmon peak widens, but is still present and shifted to the left by about 10 per cent. At still larger q values the
plasmon peak vanishes.

This behavior is in striking contradiction to the RPA predictions where no plasmon peak can be observed due to
the strong Landau damping. However, the RPA is inapplicable in the strong coupling regime, where the potential
energy is dominant. On the contrary, our MD simulations for the case of weak degeneracy are in a good agreement
with corresponding MD simulations of Hansen et al. for the classical one component plasma [4].

We conclude therefore that our model yields reasonable results in describing the dynamic properties of the electron

gas at least at weak and moderate degeneracy.

Due to the antisymmetry of the imaginary part of the inverse DF all even frequency moments vanish, whereas
the odd frequency moments are purely expressable in terms of the static properties of the electron gas. After a

There is no phenomenological basis for the choice of an unique Q(~k, z) , which would provide an exact expression

for ε−1(~k, ω) .

If one is interested in the investigation of the dispersion relation only it suﬃcies to neglect Q(~k, ω), since the
damping is small in strongly coupled plasmas. If one puts Q(~k, ω) = 0 one obtains the expression of the inverse
dielectric function obtained within the quasilocalized charge approach of Kalman [23]. The disadvantage of this
choice of Q is that damping is not taken into account. As a result the shape of the dynamic structure factor within
this approach is reduced to a simple δ function peak at the frequency ω2(k) . Thus only the peak position but not
the shape of the dynamic structure factor can be described appropriately.

The easiest way to go beyond the simple approximation Q = 0 is to put the function Q(~k, ω) equal to its static

value:

where h(~k) is connected to the static value of the dynamic structure factor S(~k, 0):

Q(~k, z) = Q(~k, 0) = ih(~k)

Formula Eq. (28) interpolates between the low frequency behavior (described by C0(k) and S(k, 0)) and the high
frequency behavior (given by the moments C2(k) and C4(k)) of the loss function. Though there is no direct justiﬁcation
that the above interpolation formula describes the loss function in an appropriate manner also for intermediate
frequencies, we expect that Eq. (28) reproduces the whole shape of the loss function at least qualitatively.

The analysis of the MD calculations is based on the formula Eq. (28). To calculate the frequencies h(q) , ω1(q) and
ω2(q) (q = ka) the static structure factors from HNC equations were used. Since the latter are classical equations we
have restricted our comparison of the sum rule approach to the MD calculations to the case of weak degeneracy. (In
this case the dynamic structure factor S(q, ω) coincides with the loss function R(q, ω)).

The results of the comparison of the loss function calculated from the MD simulations and that obtained from the
Nevanlinna formula are shown for diﬀerent q vectors at Γ = 100 and Γ = 1, respectively. The agreement between
theory and simulations is quite good. The theoretical curves reproduce rather well the variation of the shape of the
dynamic structure factor and describe the plasmon peak position in a good manner. However, the agreement of the
height of the peaks is less satisfactory (Figs.6-8).We believe that one of the reasons for this disagreement between the
results of simulations with theoretical predictions might be the normalization to S(q, 0) which is a value rather bad
measured in the simulations due to the poor statistics at long times.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The results of quasiclassical molecular dynamics simulations of the electron gas using momentum dependent eﬀective
potentials have been reported. The quasiclassical MD computations were performed for diﬀerent coupling constants
(Γ = 1 and Γ = 100) at various degeneracy (θ = 1 and θ = 50). The eﬀective potential was chosen to describe both
the Pauli principle and the Heisenberg uncertainty. The changing of the coupling constant Γ leads to qualitative
changes in the dispersion curve of the density ﬂuctuations.

At moderate coupling (Γ = 1) the dispersion is positive, the plasmon peak is observed only for the smallest
wavenumber q = 0.618 . As can be seen from Figs. 2 and 3 this behavior is qualitatively conﬁrmed by the RPA
calculations, however, quantitative deviations from the RPA predictions as a slight shift of the plasmon peak to the
left were observed.

5

In the strong coupling regime the shape of the loss function changes qualitatively (Fig.4). At Γ = 100 the dispersion
is negative, a very sharp plasmon peak is observed for the smallest wavenumber, with increasing q the peak widens
but is present up to q = 3.1. At still greater q the plasmon peak vanishes.

Thus, the collective behaviour of the electron gas at weak and moderate coupling can be understood as oscillations
of the total charge in the Debye sphere, the individual particles in the sphere moving almost independently. This is
the regime of the collisionless plasma described by the RPA. On the other hand one can interpretate the collective
motion in the strong coupling regime as solid-like collective oscillations when the motion of each of the particles is
coupled to the collective oscillations. This is also conﬁrmed by the shape of the velocity autocorrelation function
(Fig.1).

In contrast to the qualitative change of the shape of the loss function by varying the coupling constant the variation
of θ in the range from θ = 50 to θ = 1 has only small inﬂuence on the behavior of the loss function (Fig.5).However,
we expect a greater inﬂuence at higher degrees of degeneracy.

As demonstrated in Figs.6-8 the above features are rather well produced by a simple sum rule analysis.
Finally we note that our quantum molecular dynamic simulations describe the dynamic properties of the electron

gas only approximately.

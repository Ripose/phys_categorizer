Abstract

Transition phenomena between thermal noise state and turbulent
state observed in a submarginal turbulent plasma are analyzed with
statistical theory. Time-development of turbulent ﬂuctuation is ob-
tained by numerical simulations of Langevin equation which contains
hysteresis characteristics. Transition rates between two states are ana-
lyzed. Transition from turbulent state to thermal noise state occurs in
entire region between subcritical bifurcation point and linear stability
boundary.

1 Introduction

There have been observed various kinds of formations and destructions of
transport barriers. Both in edge and internal regions of high temperature
plasmas, the dynamical change often occurs on the short time scale, some-
times triggered by subcritical bifurcation. These features naturally lead to
the concept of transition.

The transition takes place as a statistical process in the presence of sta-
tistical noise source induced by strong turbulence ﬂuctuation. As the generic
feature the transition occurs with a ﬁnite probability when a parameter ap-
proaches the critical value.

The nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, which deals with dynamical
phase transitions and critical phenomena, should be extended for inhomoge-
neous plasma turbulence [1]. To this end, statistical theory for plasma turbu-
lence has been developed and stochastic equations of motion (the Langevin
equations) of turbulent plasma were derived [2]. The framework to calculate
the probability density function (PDF), the transition rates etc. have also
been made.

In this paper, we apply the theoretical algorithm to an inhomogeneous
plasma with the pressure gradient and the shear of the magnetic ﬁeld. Micro
turbulence is known to be subcritically excited from the thermal noise state
[3]. The transition between thermal noise state and turbulent state is studied.
We show that the transition occurs stochastically by numerically solving the
Langevin equation of the turbulent plasmas.
In order to characterize the
stochastic nature of the transition, the frequency of occurrence of a transition
per unit time (the transition rate) is calculated as a function of the pressure-
gradient and the plasma temperature. The results show that the transition
from the turbulent state to the thermal noise state occurs in a wide region
instead of at a transition point.

2 Theoretical Framework

In this section, we brieﬂy review the theoretical framework [2] used in our
analysis of turbulent plasmas.

The theory is based on the Langevin equation Eq. (1) derived by renor-
malizing with the direct-interaction approximation the reduced MHD for the
three ﬁelds: the electro-static potential, the current and the pressure.

Since N (t) is a force which ﬂuctuates randomly in time, the Langevin equa-
tion describes the stochastic time-development of the ﬂuctuation of the three
ﬁelds.

By analyzing the Langevin equation Eq.

(1), a number of statistical
properties of turbulent plasmas can be derived. For example, it was shown
that asymptotic forms of the probability distribution functions for the energy
of the ﬂuctuation of the electric ﬁeld obeys a power-law. The analytical
formulae of the rate of change of states of plasmas, the transition rates, were
also derived. Furthermore, since the renormalized transport coeﬃcients come
from the term of the random force N (t), relations between the ﬂuctuation

levels of turbulence and the transport coeﬃcients like the viscosity and the
thermal diﬀusivity were derived.

3 A Model

With the theoretical framework brieﬂy described in the previous section, we
analyze a model of inhomogeneous plasmas with the pressure-gradient and
the shear of magnetic ﬁeld [2]. The model is formulated with the reduced
MHD of the three ﬁelds of the electro-static potential, the current and the
pressure. The shear of magnetic ﬁeld is given as B = (0, B0sx, B0) where
B0(x) = const × (1 + Ω′x + · · ·). The pressure is assumed to change in
x−direction.

It has been known that in this system bifurcation due to the subcritical
excitation of the current diﬀusive interchange mode (CDIM) occurs [3] as
shown in Fig. (1).

Figure (1) shows the pressure-gradient dependence of the turbulent ion-
viscosity which is proportional to the ﬂuctuation level. It is clearly seen that
the bifurcation between a low viscosity state and a high viscosity state occurs.
Due to the bifurcation, transition between the two states and hysteresis are

expected to be observed. We call the low viscosity state “the thermal noise
state”, since in this state the system ﬂuctuates with thermal noise considered
in the model [4]. We call the high viscosity state “the turbulent state”, since
the ﬂuctuation level is also large in a strong turbulent limit [2]. The ridge
point where the turbulent branch ends is denoted “the subcritical bifurcation
point”. The region between the subcritical bifurcation point and the ridge
near the linear stability boundary is called “the bi-stable regime”.

From the deterministic point of view, the transition from the thermal
noise state to the turbulent state is expected to occur at the ridge point near
the linear stability boundary and the transition in the opposite direction is
expected to occur at the subcritical bifurcation point.

4 Stochastic Occurrence of the Transition

In order to capture the characteristics of the two states, we concentrate on
the time-development of the energy of ﬂuctuation of the electric ﬁeld, ε(t).
The quantity ε(t) obeys the coarse-grained Langevin equation Eq. (2) which
has been derived in [2].

d
dt

ε(t) = −2Λ(ε)ε(t) + η(ε)R(t).

(2)

Here, R(t) is assumed to be the Gaussian white noise. For the detailed
formulae of Λ(ε) and η(ε), see [4]. The essential point is that the function
Λ(ε) takes both a positive and a negative value in the bi-stable regime. So,
the ﬂuctuation of the electric ﬁeld is suppressed when Λ is positive and it is
excited when Λ is negative. Consequently, there are two metastable states
in the bi-stable regime. In addition, η(ε) is a positive function.

By solving numerically Eq.

(2), we obtain the following samples of a
time serieses. When the pressure-gradient is ﬁxed at the value smaller than
the subcritical bifurcation value, as shown in Fig. (2), there is only small
ﬂuctuation since the system is always in the thermal noise state.

On the other hand, when the pressure-gradient takes a value in the bi-
stable regime, bursts are observed intermittently as shown in Fig. (3). That
is, transition between the thermal noise state and the turbulent state occurs
stochastically. The bursts corresponds to the turbulent state and the laminar
corresponds to the thermal noise state. The fact that the residence times at
the each states are random leads to the statistical description of the transition
with the transition rates described in the next section.

When the value of the pressure-gradient is larger than that of the linear
stability boundary (see Fig. (4)), bursts are always observed. It means that
the system is always in the turbulent state.

5 The Transition Rates

In order to formulate the above stochastic transition phenomena in the bi-
stable regime, we introduce the transition rates. There are transitions in
two opposite direction: the transition from the thermal noise state to the
turbulent noise state, which we call “the forward transition, and the tran-
sition in the opposite direction is called “the backward transition”. There
are two transition rates. One is the forward transition rates rf which is
the frequency of occurrence of the forward transition per unit time and the
other is the backward transition rate rb deﬁned similarly as the frequency of
occurrence of the backward transition per unit time.

It is important to note that these quantities are observable quantities. It
is easily shown that the forward transition rate is equal to the average of
inverse of the residence time at the thermal noise state and the backward
transition rate is equal to the average of inverse of the residence time at the
turbulent state. Therefore, these transition rates can be measured from the
time serieses of ﬂuctuation.

We analyze in which region of the value of the pressure-gradient the tran-
sition occurs frequently. The transition rates are calculated with the formulae
derived in [5]. Two ﬁgures, Fig. (5) and Fig. (6), show the pressure-gradient
dependence of the forward transition rate and the backward transition rate
in the bi-stable regime.

The forward transition triggered by the thermal noise occurs mainly in
the vicinity of the linear stability boundary. In contrast, it is clearly seen
that the backward transition occurs in the almost entire bi-stable regime.
It is noted that the
This behavior is due to strong turbulent ﬂuctuation.

6 Summary and Discussion

Summarizing our work, we applied the statistical theory of plasma turbu-
lence to problems of the transition phenomena of submarginal turbulence.
By numerically solving the Langevin equation, the typical time-development
of ﬂuctuation is obtained. It tells that the transition for the model of in-
homogeneous plasma occurs stochastically and suggests how the transition
phenomena due to subcritical bifurcation may look in time-serieses obtained
in real experiments.

Furthermore, we obtained the pressure-gradient dependence of the tran-
It is shown that the backward transition occur with almost
sition rates.
equal frequency in the entire bi-stable regime, so the transition occurs in a
“region”. The concept “transition region” is necessary in the analysis of data
obtained by real experiments.

It is important to discuss whether the transition phenomena considered
in this paper can be observed in real experiments. Since the characteristic
time-scale of the transition is given by the inverse of the transition rate,
observability depends on the interrelation between the time resolution of
observation △t and the transition rate r. When △t is much smaller than
1/r, the transition phenomena as shown in Fig.
(3) are expected to be
observed. On the other hand, when △t is of the same order of 1/r or larger
than 1/r, transition phenomena average out and only the average over △t is
observed. This discussion is generic regardless of the type of transition, e.g.
the transition between the thermal noise state and the turbulent state, L/H
transition etc.

The Nonlinear Debye-Onsager Relaxation Eﬀect in Weakly Ionized Plasmas

A weakly ionized plasma under the inﬂuence of a strong electric ﬁeld is considered. Supposing
a local Maxwellian distribution for the electron momenta the plasma is described by hydrodynamic
equations for the pair distribution functions. These equations are solved and the relaxation ﬁeld is
calculated for an arbitrary ﬁeld strength. It is found that the relaxation eﬀect becomes lower with
increasing strength of the electrical ﬁeld.

I. INTRODUCTION

Transport in high electric ﬁeld has become a topic of current interest in various ﬁelds of physics. The shrinking sizes
of modern devices with the applied voltages remaining the same produces very strong ﬁelds. A further motivation for
the investigation of high ﬁeld transport eﬀects is the application of strong laser ﬁelds to matter. Nonlinear transport
eﬀects due to strong short laserpulses can be studied in semiconductors [1] and in plasma physics [2].

In this paper we consider a weakly ionized plasma in strong electric ﬁeld. A plasma is called weakly ionized if the
collision frequency of ions with neutrals is much greater than the ion-ion collision frequency. Therefore, in a weakly
ionized plasma the relaxation time for the momenta of the charged particles is much less then the relaxation time for
the screening cloud surrounding a charge.

The inﬂuence of ﬁeld eﬀects to the plasma conductivity is twofold. First, the external ﬁeld modiﬁes the distribution
function of electrons and induces a current. Second, the ﬁeld deforms the screening cloud. As a result an internal
ﬁeld is induced, which is directed opposite to the external ﬁeld and diminishes the total ﬁeld acting on the charges
(the Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect).

A kinetic equation for the determination of the electron distribution function in weakly ionized plasmas was derived
by Dawydow [3]. It was shown that the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld on the electron distribution is weak as far as the electron
energy gain by the ﬁeld during the mean free path is much less then the energy transferred by one collision of the
electron with a neutral, i.e., if

where e is the elementary charge, E the electric ﬁeld strength, l the length of mean free path, T is the temperature of
the plasma, m and M are the masses of the electrons and the neutrals, respectively.

The Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect was ﬁrst derived within the theory of electrolytes [4]. It has been shown that
in a dilute electrolyte solution with two sorts of ions the total ﬁeld acting on a charged paricle is reduced by an

density and the mobility of the ions of type a. Recently the Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect has become a topic of
renewed interest. First it was shown that the relaxation eﬀect is essential for a proper virial expansion of the electrical
conductivity of a fully ionized plasma [5]. Second the Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect in fully ionized plasmas beyond
linear response was studied within the memory approach [6]. The aim of this paper is to investigate the nonlinear
Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect in weakly ionized plasmas.

II. HYDRODYNAMIC APPROXIMATION

Consider a weakly ionized plasma consisting of N0 neutrals, Na particles of sort a with charges ea, masses Ma,
a Na, the neutrality condition reads

Nb particles of sort b, etc. The total number of charged particles is N =

1

P

a eaNa = 0. We suppose that N0

N . Consider now the plasma under the inﬂuence of a static homogeneous
electrical ﬁeld ~E. In what follows we suppose that the electric ﬁeld strength is restricted by condition Eq. (1) and the
P
electron distribution function can be approximated by the Maxwell distribution. Besides Eq. (1) no other restrictions
will be imposed on the electrical ﬁeld strength. As far as Eq.(1) is satisﬁed we will regard the relation between the
dipole energy of the deformed screening cloud to the temperature of the plasma as an arbitrary one. Of course we
also neglect eﬀects of impact ionization in an external ﬁeld.

The system of charged particles is then described by the N-particle distribution function FN (x1, . . . , xN , v1, . . . , vN ),

satisfying the generalized Liouville equation [7]

The right-hand side of Eq. (3) describes the collisions of the charged particles with the neutrals. In Eq. (3) we
suppose that the collisions of two diﬀerent particles are independent. Introducing truncated distribution functions
one obtains from Eq. (3) the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of kinetic equations [8]. If
the charged component of the plasma forms a weakly coupled plasma, i.e., if

(e2/T )(4πN /3V )

1 ,

≪

the BBGKY hierarchy can be truncated by supposing that all distribution functions of order higher than 2 can be
expressed by the one- and two-particle distribution functions. Then one arrives at a system of equations for the one-
and two-particles distribution functions [8,7]

This system can be further simpliﬁed by supposing a local Maxwellian distribution for the velocities in the one and

two-particle distribution functions. In the quasistationary case one arrives thus at the system of equations [7]

In Eq. (5) ba is the mobility of a particle of sort a, φb( ~ra, ~rb) is the potential created at point ~ra by a particle of sort b
situated at point ~rb and hab( ~ra, ~rb) is the two-particle distribution function. The system of diﬀerential equations Eqs.
(4) and (5) can be solved by a Fourier transformation. For the sake of simplicity we consider now a weakly ionized
plasma consisting of neutrals, electrons and one sort of ions with charges Ze. Since the mobility of the electrons
is much greater than that of the ions we neglect the ion mobility. Than a straightforward calculation leads to the
following expression for the Fourier transforms of the distribution functions and the potentials:

The nonlinear relaxation eﬀect can be described via the function F (α) in Eq. (8). For the case of a weak external
1 the relaxation ﬁeld diﬀers from the corresponding ﬁeld in the linear regime by a small amount,

electric ﬁeld α
and is given by the expression

≪

In the opposite case of a very strong electric ﬁeld α

1 the relaxation eﬀect is described by the asymptotic behavior

of the function F (α),

One can compare the relaxation eﬀect calculated in the present approach with the corresponding result from a
memory approach [6]. In the latter approach a kinetic equation for the one-particle distribution function is employed
which diﬀers from the ordinary Boltzmann equation in two points. (1) A collisional broadening as a result of the ﬁnite
collision duration. (2) The intracollisional ﬁeld eﬀect, which gives additional retardation eﬀects in the momentum of
the one-particle distribution function due to the ﬁeld. Then the relaxation ﬁeld is found to be

(Unfortunately in [6] is given an incorrect result, in Eq (11) we have corrected the result.) Note that the memory
approach leads to another expression for the linear relaxation eﬀect than the hydrodynamic approach.

(cid:21)

In Fig. 1 we have plotted the nonlinear relaxation eﬀect via the functions F (α) from Eq. (8) and FM (α) from
Eq. (11). One regognizes that within the both approaches the relaxation eﬀect lowers with increasing strength of the
external electric ﬁeld and that for very strong external ﬁelds the relaxation ﬁeld goes asymptotically to zero. Within
the memory approach a faster decay is predicted.

The vanishing of the relaxation eﬀect can be understood as follows. In a strong external electric ﬁeld the electron-
ion plasma decouples and forms two almost independent subsystems, an electron and an ion subsystem moving in
opposite directions. As a result the electron-ion correlations [described by ˜hie(~k) in Eq.
(6)] vanish, there is no
deformed screening cloud anymore and the relaxation eﬀect is absent.

α = e

E/kDeT .

We have examined the nonlinear Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect in weakly coupled plasmas. The hydrodynamic
approximation was used in order to derive equations for the pair correlation functions and the relaxation ﬁeld. It was
shown that with increasing external ﬁeld the relaxation ﬁeld becomes lower and goes asymptotically to zero for the
case of very strong electric ﬁelds.

We should remember here that the asymptotic region α

1 is rather a hypothetical one since at very strong
external ﬁelds the condition Eq. (1) breaks down and the hydrodynamic approach used in our calculations becomes
inapplicable. On the other hand the hydrodynamic equations for the pair correlation functions Eqs. (6) are also
valid for electrolytes, and they should be valid, too, if a strong external electric ﬁeld is applied. However, the present
approach does not take into account electrophoretic eﬀects which become important for electrolytes [9].

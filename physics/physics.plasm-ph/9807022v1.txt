Beam Instabilities in Magnetized Pair Plasma

Maxim Lyutikov 1

ABSTRACT

Beam instabilities in the strongly magnetized electron-positron plasma of pulsar

magnetospheres are considered. We analyze the resonance conditions and estimate the growth
rates of the Cherenkov and cyclotron instabilities of the ordinary (O), extraordinary (X) and
Alfv´en modes in two limiting regimes: kinetic and hydrodynamic. As a preliminary step,
we reconsider wave dispersion and polarization properties in a one dimensional pair plasma
taking into account relativistic thermal eﬀects. We then ﬁnd the location of the Cherenkov
and cyclotron resonance of the X, O and Alfv´en waves with the particles from the primary
beam. The importance of the diﬀerent instabilities as a source of the coherent pulsar radiation
generation is then estimated taking into account the angular dependence of the growth rates and
the limitations on the length of the coherent wave-particle interaction imposed by the curvature
of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. We conclude, that in the pulsar magnetosphere the Cherenkov-type
instabilities occur in the hydrodynamic regimes, while the cyclotron-type instabilities occur in
the kinetic regime. We argue, that electromagnetic cyclotron-type instabilities on the X, O and
probably Alfv´en waves are more likely to develop in the pulsar magnetosphere.

Introduction

At the moment the most promising theories of the pulsar radio emission generation are based on the

plasma emission model, in which the high brightness radio emission is generated by plasma instabilities
developing in the outﬂowing plasma (Melrose 1995). To ﬁnd the instability that can be responsible for the
generation of pulsar radio emission it is essential to know the dispersion relations of the normal modes of
the medium and take into account the evolution of the modes as they propagate outward in the pulsar
magnetosphere.

In a standard model of pulsar magnetospheres (Goldreich & Julian 1969, Sturrock 1960) rotating,
strongly magnetized neutron stars induce strong electric ﬁelds that pull the charges from their surfaces.
Inside the closed ﬁeld lines of the neutron star magnetosphere, a steady charge distribution established,
compensating the induced electric ﬁeld. On the open ﬁeld lines, the neutron star generates a dense ﬂow
of relativistic electron-positron pairs penetrated by a highly relativistic electron or positron beam. This
relativistic ﬂow generates the observed pulsar radio emission.

First, we present a consideration of the properties of linear waves in a strongly magnetized electron-

positron plasma with similar distributions of electrons and positron. We take into account possible
relativistic temperatures of plasma component. The particles are assumed to be in their ground gyrational
state so that the plasma is one-dimensional. Properties of a one-dimensional pair plasma are considerably
diﬀerent from the properties of a well studied electron-ion plasma. Previously, Suvorov & Chugunov 1975
investigated the dispersion relations in a one-dimensional plasma with a power law distribution of the

particles, Arons & Barnard 1986 considered waves in a cold plasma and in a warm plasma using a water
bag distribution. For the propagation of the coupled O-Alfven modes, Arons & Barnard 1986 considered
the case of inﬁnitely strong magnetic ﬁeld and found that the O branch is always superluminous and
thus cannot be excited by the Cherenkov mechanism. On the other hand, Volokitin, Krasnosel’skikh &
Machabeli 1985 took into account ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld and found that the O wave becomes subluminous
for large wave numbers allowing Cherenkov excitation. Lyutikov 1998 considered the waves in pair plasma
taking into account the relative motion of electrons and positrons. Zank & Greaves 1995 used a ﬂuid theory
to consider waves in a nonrelativistic three-dimensional pair plasma. In our approach we use relativistic
kinetic theory assuming that the possible resonant and nonresonant contributions from the beam particles
may be considered as perturbations to the initial plasma state.

We resort to similar distributions of the pair plasma with equal densities and neglect the curvature
of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. These approximations require some justiﬁcations. First, the pulsar plasma is
nonneutral due to the presence of the primary beam. We neglect the nonneutrality of plasma since the
density of plasma np is thought to be much larger than the Goldreich-Julian density nGJ = Ω
np = λ nGJ = 103
106nGJ (Ω is a rotational frequency of the neutron star, q is a charge of a particle,
B is magnetic ﬁeld, c is a speed of light, λ is the multiplicity factor). Secondly, the inhomogeneity of the
magnetic ﬁeld results in a curvature drift of the particles perpendicular to the osculating plane. It can be
shown that for the typical parameters in the pulsar magnetosphere the drift velocity of plasma particles
due to the curvature of magnetic ﬁeld lines could be neglected in the calculations of the real part of the
γ2
prL (here γp is the
dielectric tensor unless the curvature of ﬁeld lines RB satisﬁes the condition RB ≪
average streaming energy of plasma particles in the pulsar frame and rL = c/ωB ia a Larmor radius). This
follows from the assumption of a nonrelativistic transverse motion and the transformation of the radius
of curvature seen in the center of gyration frame RB,cg = RB/γ2 (RB is the radius of curvature in the
pulsar frame, γ is the Lorentz factor of the particle). This condition is well satisﬁed inside the pulsar
magnetosphere for the plasma streaming energy γp < 104. By contrast, the drift velocity may be very
important for the high energy resonant particles.

In this paper we consider wave excitation in a strongly magnetized pair plasma in the approximation
of straight magnetic ﬁeld lines, thus omitting an important Cherenkov-drift resonance (Lyutikov, Blandford
& Machabeli 1998b, Lyutikov, Machabeli & Blandford 1998a). This is an important mechanism that may
be responsible for the generation of the cone type emission in pulsars. The electromagnetic Cherenkov-drift
instability occurs in the kinetic regime on the high frequency vacuum-like O and X waves. It has the same
advantages as the electromagnetic cyclotron instabilities considered in this paper.

In presenting our results we were trying to ﬁnd a balance between providing an exact general relation
and ﬁnding a simple useful analytical approximation, which gives an idea of how modes behave in diﬀerent
regimes. Several approximations will be extensively used. For the case of radio waves propagating in the
pulsar magnetosphere there is naturally a small parameter, ω/ωB (ω is a frequency of a wave), so that in
many cases complicated dispersion relations and polarization properties can be simpliﬁed by expanding
in this parameter. When making such expansion one should be especially careful near the points where
dispersion curves almost intersect (Eq. 15). A formal expansion in ω/ωB diverges near the intersection
point. In this case, since the intersection formally occurs only for the parallel propagation, the relevant
small parameter is the angle of propagation with respect to magnetic ﬁeld. Another simpliﬁcation that
we will often use, is the expansion in a ratio of the plasma frequency ωp to the cyclotron frequency
ωB = eB/mc (m is a mass of a particle) ωp ≪

The main conlusions of our work are the following. For the chosen parameters of the magnetosphere

plasma, the Cherenkov-type electrostatic beam instabilities develop in a hydrodynamic regime, while
cyclotron-type electromagnetic instabilities develop in a kinetic regime. Electrostatic beam instabilities
in the pulsar plasma are generally weaker than the electromagnetic instabilities. In addition, Cherenkov
instabilities have largest growth rate near the stellar surface, where the Cherenkov resonance can occurs only
on the Alfv´en mode. However, this mode cannot escape to inﬁnity, even though it has some electromagnetic
component. Another factor that limits the development of the Cherenkov-type instabilities is that they
grow within a much narrower angles than cyclotron instabilities. In a curved magnetic ﬁeld this results in a
shorter length of the coherent wave-particle interaction.

The relative weakness of electrostatic instabilities as compared to electromagnetic instabilities is
an unusual characteristics of the strongly relativistic beams. The reason is that for the particles in
the primary beam, which contribute to the development of the instability, the eﬀective parallel mass is

2. Plasma Parameters

To a large extent a possible mechanism for the generation of pulsar radio emission is predicated on the
choice of parameters of the plasma ﬂow that is generated by a rotating neutron star. At this point we know
only the general features of the distribution function of the particles in a pulsar magnetosphere (Tademaru
1973,Arons 1981, Daugherty & Harding 1983). It is believed to comprise (see Fig. 1) (i) a highly relativistic
107 and density equal to the Goldreich-Julian density nGJ, (ii)
primary beam with the Lorentz factor γb ≈
1000, a similar scatter
a secondary electron positron plasma with a bulk streaming Lorentz factor γp ≈

(subscript α in Eq. (1) refers to the electrons and positrons of the bulk plasma). Secondary pairs are
born with almost the same energy in the avalanche-like process above in the polar cap (Arons 1983). The
combination of the pair plasma and primary beam is expected to screen the rotationally induced electric
ﬁeld so that the ﬂow is force-free.

Another relation between the parameters of the plasma and the beam comes from the energy argument

that the primary particles stop producing the pairs when the energy in the pair plasma becomes equal to
the energy in the primary beam:

In this paper we neglect the diﬀerence of energies of secondary plasma components which arises as

the ﬂow propagates outward in curved magnetic ﬁeld lines. For the consideration of the eﬀects of relative
velocity on the wave dispersion see Lyutikov 1998.

The uncertainty in the physics of the pair formation front forces us to allow for a broad range of plasma

parameters. Accordingly, the growth rates of the particular instabilities can vary considerably depending
on the assumed parameters. The numerical estimates will be given for a typical pulsar with the period P=
109 cm), and the surface magnetic ﬁeld B = 1012 G and the primary
0.5 s (light cylinder radius Rll = 2.4

beam Lorentz factor γb = 2
number of free parameters to two: plasma temperature and the bulk streaming energy γp (or temperature
and the multiplicity factor λ). Consequently, we will consider two separate cases of cold and relativistically
hot plasma. For numerical estimates we will use the following ﬁducial numbers: γp = 100, λ105, Tp ≪
1 for
the cold plasma, and γp = 100, λ = 104, Tp ≈
temperature of plasma in units of mc2).

electric vector along B.

This intersection occurs only for the parallel propagation, while for oblique propagation the dispersion
curves for O, X and Alfv´en modes are well separated. It follows that equation (13) describes the O mode
for k < k∗ and the Alfv´en mode for k > k∗, while equation (14) describes the X mode for all frequencies
and the Alfv´en mode for k < k∗ and the O mode for k > k∗.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

As the wave propagates in a curved magnetic ﬁeld of the pulsar magnetosphere, it’s path on the

CMA diagram (see Sections 4.6) depends on the branch that the wave belongs to. In the linear regime
in wave amplitude and with the adiabatically changing parameters of a medium, a wave always stays on
a given branch. For example, original electrostatic wave emitted along the magnetic ﬁeld can acquire
electromagnetic components as it propagates in the presence of a curved magnetic ﬁeld. The linear
evolution of the longitudinal plasma wave, emitted originally along the ﬁeld line, will drastically depend on
which branch (O or Alfv´en) the wave actually belongs to. The propagation of O and Alfv´en waves in the
inhomogeneous plasma of a pulsar magnetosphere diﬀers considerably (Arons & Barnard 1986, Barnard
& Arons 1986). If the plasma wave is emitted with the wave vector (or frequency) above the intersection
point k > k∗, then the linear transformation of the longitudinal plasma wave will follow the Alfv´en branch,
which cannot escape magnetosphere. On the other hand, if the plasma wave is emitted with the wave vector
below the intersection point k <, k∗, then the linear transformation of the longitudinal plasma wave will
follow the O branch, which may escape from plasma.

– 7 –

4.4. Oblique Propagation

In the pulsar magnetosphere the waves that may be important for the generation of the observed radio

emission have frequencies much less than the gyrofrequency. In what follows, we will often use the low
frequency approximation when all the relevant frequencies are much less than the gyrofrequency. In the
cold plasma in its rest frame this implies: ω

Solutions of equation (12) are more complicated. The simple form for the dispersion relation may

dispersion relation or in the asymptotic regimes far from the cross-over point.

The short and long wave length asymptotics are then given by (22) and (23) with the magnetic ﬁeld set to
inﬁnity.

An important point in considering the wave excitation in the superstrong magnetic ﬁeld is that we

cannot neglect the very large but ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld. In the approximation of the inﬁnitely strong
magnetic ﬁeld the O mode is always superluminous and thus cannot be excited by the Cherenkov-type
resonant wave-particle interaction. In this limit any instability would occur on the Alfv´en waves which are
strongly damped as they propagate out in the pulsar magnetosphere. When the ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld is
taken into account, O wave becomes subluminous for the small angles of propagation and can be resonantly
excited by the Cherenkov, cyclotron or Cherenkov-drift interaction with the fast particles.

4.6. CMA Diagram for Cold Pair Plasma

CMA diagrams (e.g. Budden 1985) are useful tools in considering wave propagation. It is a plot of the

refractive index versus some functions of wave, plasma and cyclotron frequencies. We chose the following

In the pulsar magnetosphere the plasma is moving along the ﬁeld lines with a bulk Lorenz factor
1000. In this frame the waves propagating in diﬀerent directions have diﬀerent dispersion

γp ≈
relations. So that the dispersion equation for the X mode becomes a fourth order equation for ω(k). To
simplify the consideration we will use the low frequency approximation from the very beginning, i.e. we
expand all the relevant relations in 1/ωB. In what follows, the quantities measured in the pulsar frame will
be denoted with primes.

6.1. Eﬀects of Thermal Motion on Wave Dispersion

≥

ωp and the dispersion of the O mode frequencies ω

In this section we consider wave propagation in the relativistically hot, strongly magnetized electron-
positron plasma. The thermal motion of plasma particles aﬀects considerably the dispersion of the Alfv´en
mode at frequencies ω
quantitative modiﬁcation is in the dispersion relation of the X mode. An important factor for the excitation
of the X mode is the diﬀerence of its phase speed and the speed of light. This diﬀerence is roughly
proportional to < 1/γ3 > (Eq. 58). It is decreased considerably by the bulk streaming of the plasma. In the
relativistically hot streaming plasma there are more particles with low Lorentz factors, that contribute to
< 1/γ3 >, than in the cold plasma streaming with with the same average velocity. So for a given streaming
velocity relativistically hot plasma has larger < 1/γ3 > and larger growth rate.

ωp. Another important

To estimate the thermal eﬀects on the dispersion of the plasma mode we use the two kinds of

distribution functions: (i) waterbag distribution

(here pT ≈
B and C for the calculations of the relevant moments of the distribution)

mcγT is the scatter in moments) and (ii) relativistic Maxwellian distribution (see also Appendices

≫

≫

Both these distributions are ”fast falling” at large moments. This is an important factor for the

p
dispersion relation of plasma waves (see below). The advantage of the water bag distribution is that the
various moments of the distribution can be easily calculated. The relativistic Maxwellian distribution is
explicitly Lorentz-invariant (see Appendix B for details of Lorentz transformation).

The relevant moments of the distributions are summarized in Table 1 for the water bag distribution

(in the plasma frame only) and in Table 2 for the relativistic Maxwellian distribution (in both plasma and
pulsar frame).

The water bag distribution is generally a good approximation for the account of the thermal motion of

the particles. Its major drawback is the absence of a tail of high energy particles, that can resonate with
the waves in the plasma. The Cherenkov resonance on the tail particles will result in a strong damping of
the waves. The cyclotron resonance on the tail particles may result in a wave excitation if the distribution
function is asymmetric with a long high energy tail. The condition, that the Cherenkov resonance is
unimportant, is that the phase speed of the waves in plasma is much larger, than the thermal velocity of
the particles. In the case of the idealized water bag distribution this condition has to be put in by hand.
Whenever the phase speed of the wave becomes comparable to the thermal velocity the waves should be
considered strongly damped and nonexistent. Therefore, we expect that the high frequency branch of the
Alfv´en wave, which in the limit of cold plasma had a very low phase velocity, will be strongly damped.

Here, we should also mention a long standing controversy about the dispersion of the longitudinal
waves and the possibility of the two stream instabilities in the relativistic plasma. In the initial work (
Silin 1960) and later works ( Suvorov & Chugunov 1975) it was stated that the relativistic plasma does
not support subluminous longitudinal waves. This problem has been considered anew (Tsytovich & Kaplan
1972) who found subluminous waves. The controversy has been resolved by Lominadze & Mikhailovskii
1978 who demonstrated the existence of the subluminous waves in the range 0 < n
provided that the third moment of the distribution (< γ3 >) is ﬁnite (here n is the refractive index and
< γ >
oﬀ at large momenta slower than 1

1 is the average Lorentz factor of the plasma particles). Thus, when the distribution function falls

γ4 subluminous plasma waves do not exist.

For the water bag distribution, the dispersion of the plasma waves for the parallel propagation is given

The normal modes of a hot plasma are given by the solution of (9) with the dielectric tensor (43).
Similarly to the cold case, equation (43) factorizes into a dispersion relation for the X mode and a coupled
equation for the Alfv´e and O modes.

In the case of parallel propagation the dispersion equation gives two transverse wave with the dispersion

and a plasma wave

The phase speed for the high frequency asymptotic of the plasma wave (46) approaches the phase
speed of the thermal particles cβT . For the more realistic distribution function, these parts of the dispersion
relation will be strongly damped on the Cherenkov resonance with the thermal tail particles. The high
frequency asymptotic of the plasma wave belongs to the Alfv´en wave. From this we make a conclusion that
the high frequency (kc

Tpωp) part of the Alfv´en wave is strongly damped and does not propagate.

7. Hydrodynamic and Kinetic Instabilities

The description of the beam-plasma instabilities is based on the scheme used to solve the general

problem of linear oscillations in plasma. The initial equations are the linearized kinetic equations for the

particles in a self-consistent electromagnetic ﬁeld and Maxwell’s equations. When the unperturbed state of
the beam and plasma is stationary and spatially uniform, we can use Eq. (9) to ﬁnd the normal modes of a
medium.

For the beam-plasma system the dielectric tensor ǫαβ(ω, k) may be represented as a sum of contributions

from plasma and beam.

If the plasma alone is stable, then the frequency of the normal modes will have a zero imaginary
part. In the ﬁrst approximation, dispersion relation (9) may be expanded taking into account a small
contribution to the dielectric tensor from the beam. The frequency shift ∆(k)l of the normal mode ω(k)l is
then determined from

Two separate cases may be distinguished here depending on whether the complex part of the beam

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

contribution to the dispersion relations (62) Kb(ω, k) is zero or nonzero. If Im(Kb(ω, k) = 0 then equation
(62) has real coeﬃcients. The complex solutions of Eq.(62) (if any) are complex conjugates. Solutions
with the positive complex part correspond to the growing waves. These are hydrodynamic instabilities. In
hydrodynamic instabilities, all the particles of the beam resonate with the normal mode of the plasma.
This requires that the growth rate of the instability be greater than the intrinsic bandwidth of the growing
waves:

δv

k
|

·

| ≪

Im(∆(k)).

(63)

Here k is the resonant wave vector, δv is the scatter in the velocity of the beam particles. This is
satisﬁed for a very small scatter in the velocity of the beam particles, so that all the particles from the
beam resonate with the beam.

Alternatively, if the complex part of the the beam contribution to the dispersion relations (62) Kb(ω, k)

is nonzero, the frequency shift ∆(k) will always have a complex part. If the complex part of ∆(k)l is
larger than zero, then the corresponding normal mode ω(k)l will be growing at the expense of the beam
energy, while for negative ∆(k)l the mode will be damped on the resonant particles of the beam. This case
corresponds to the kinetic instability. The requirement that the frequency shift ∆(k)l due to the complex
part of Kb(ω, k) dominates over the shift due to the large real part of Kb(ω, k) requires that the growth
rate be much less than the the intrinsic bandwidth of the growing waves (reversed inequality (63)). This is
satisﬁed for a very large scatter in the velocity of the beam particles, so that at any given moment only a
small fraction of the beam particles is in resonance with the wave.

Though the physical interpretations of the kinetic and hydrodynamic instabilities are quite diﬀerent,

they may be considered as two limiting cases of a general beam instability. For a relativistic beam traveling

along a magnetic ﬁeld with average Lorentz factor γb, scatter in parallel Lorentz factors ∆γ, and average
pitch angle ψ the condition of the hydrodynamic approximation (63) takes the form

From (64) it follows that there exist a critical pitch angle

For ψ > ψcrit the scatter in pitch angles dominates over longitudinal velocity spread. For ψ > ψcrit the
average ”longitudinal” mass of the beam particles decreases by the factor of (ψγb)2 so that the instabilities
whose growth rate is inversely proportional to the ”longitudinal” mass of the particles (like Cherenkov
instability of plasma waves) may be enhanced considerably.

Relativistic particles propagating along the curved magnetic ﬁeld of a pulsar magnetosphere initially are
in the ground quantum state (zero pitch angle). They can develop a ﬁnite pitch angle by (i) particle-particle
collisions, (ii) interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld (Compton scattering on the diﬀuse thermal photons
or recoil due the emission of electromagnetic waves at anomalous cyclotron resonance), and (iii) when the
adiabatic approximation for the propagation breaks down (when the Larmor radius becomes comparable
with the size of the inhomogeneity). The pitch angle of the particles is then determined by the balance of
these forces on one hand and radiation damping at the normal synchrotron resonance and the force due to
the conservation of adiabatic invariant on the other hand.

In magnetosphere, the particle-particle collision time is very long compared with the dynamical time

because of the relatively low density of particles, high speed and the one-dimensional character of the
motion. We also assume that the Compton scattering on the diﬀuse thermal photons is unimportant and
that the adiabatic approximation for the propagation of particles is satisﬁed. The transverse component of
the force due to the radiation damping at normal synchrotron resonance dominates the transverse motion
of the particles near the neutron star, making the pitch angles equal to zero. Then the pitch angles will
remain zero throughout the region where the above conditions are satisﬁed.

In what follows we assume that plasma is one-dimensional before the development of instabilities. The

condition of hydrodynamic approximation (64) is then

In the kinetic regime this inequality is reversed.

For an instability to be important as a possible source of coherent emission generation, its growth rate,

evaluated in the pulsar frame, should be much larger than the pulsar rotation frequency Ω. The growth
rates in the pulsar and plasma frames are related by

So the requirement of a fast growth in the plasma frame is

Another, more stringent requirement on the growth rate comes from the angular dependence of a
growth rate. The emitting plasma propagates in a curved magnetic ﬁeld. If an instability has a considerable
growth inside a characteristic angle δθ′, then the growth length should be larger than δθRc, where Rc is the
curvature of the magnetic ﬁelds. In the plasma frame this requirement is

where we used δθ′

8. Cold Pair Plasma: Resonances

In the cold plasma approach the resonant interaction between the fast particles and the plasma may
be considered as the interaction of the waves in the plasma with the waves in the beam. The interaction
is the strongest when the dispersion relations of the waves intersect. Consequently, we are looking for the
possible resonances between the waves in the plasma (12) and the waves in the beam (see Fig. 7 and 8):

As we will see in Section 10, the resonant interaction of the plasma waves with the Cherenkov waves

in the beam (70) is described by the cubic equation for the frequency shift, which always has complex
conjugate solutions. This implies that the Cherenkov resonant interaction of the waves in the beam and in
the plasma is always unstable.

In contrast, the frequency shift due to the cyclotron interaction of the waves in the beam and in the

plasma (71) is described by a quadratic equation, which has two real solutions for the plus sign in (71) and
two complex solutions for the minus sign in (71). Thus, only the minus sign in (71) will contribute to the
instability growth rate. The resonance (71) with the minus sign is called anomalous Doppler resonance.
This corresponding instability may be considered as the interaction of the negative energy wave in the beam
with the positive energy wave in plasma. Due to the resonant coupling, the amplitudes of both waves grow
exponentially.

Now let us consider the condition for the resonances (70) and (71) to occur. From the low frequency

asymptotics of the Alfv´en waves (23) we infer that the possibility of the Cherenkov excitation of the Alfv´en
waves depends on the parameter

µ =

2 γb ωp
ωB

If µ < 1, then Alfv´en waves can be excited by Cherenkov resonance.2 However, if µ > 1 then Alfv´en

2 In the case of cold plasma this may be considered as a suﬃcient condition for the Cherenkov excitation of Alfv´en waves.

In the case of hot plasma this is only a necessary condition (see below).

waves cannot be excited by Cherenkov resonance. Instead, resonance can occur for an O mode subject to
the requirement of suﬃciently small angles of propagation Fig. 8.

So, at small radii (µ

≫

For the parallel propagation (and only in this case) the parts of the O and Alfv´en modes that have

longitudinal polarization may be considered as forming a single plasma wave with a dispersion ω = √2ωp.
In this particular case, the excitation of either O or Alfv´en part of the longitudinal plasma mode is
very similar. But as the waves propagate in the curved magnetic ﬁeld lines, the parts of the plasma
mode corresponding to the O or Alfv´en wave will evolve diﬀerently resulting in a diﬀerent observational
characteristics of the emergent radiation.

In what follows we consider separately the two possible cases of Cherenkov resonances: µ > 1 and

µ < 1.

We also note that the X wave cannot be excited by the Cherenkov resonance. Though the formal
intersection of the Cherenkov wave in the beam (70) with the dispersion relation of the X mode is possible
for all frequencies if µ = 1, the transverse polarization of the X mode excludes a resonant interaction with
particles streaming along the magnetic ﬁeld.

the magnetic ﬁeld, that we will use later as guide lines for the general case of oblique propagation.

the cyclotron excitation of the Alfv´en wave does not occur.

We can compare the importance of the Cherenkov excitation of plasma waves by evaluating growth

rate (83) for the set of ﬁducial parameters of a cold plasma and comparing it with the dynamical time (67):

We expect that the hydrodynamic instability will be strongest at small wave vectors. We can then use
the low frequency approximation (16) to the dispersion of the transverse waves. We seek the correction to

Next, we consider the hydrodynamic instabilities for the waves propagating perpendicular to the
magnetic ﬁeld (magnetized Wiebel instability (Weibel 1959)). The normal modes of plasma without a beam

The term containing 1/ ˆω2 contribute to Cherenkov excitation and the term containing 1/˜ω2 contribute

to the cyclotron excitation.

To ﬁnd the growth rates we expand the plasma part of (98) near the plasma modes (Eqs. (11) and
(12)) and the beam part near the resonances ˆω = 0 (for Cherenkov excitation) or ˜ω = 0 (for cyclotron
instability). The expansion of the plasma part of (98) near the plasma modes is done according to the

We recall that the Cherenkov excitation of Alfv´en waves is possible only for µ < 1 (Section 8).

The hydrodynamic growth rate of the Alfv´en waves has a maximum for parallel propagation. The

numerical estimate of the maximum rate for Cherenkov excitation of Alfv´en wave is given by (84) subject
to the condition µ < 1 ( Section 8).

We can now compare the instability growth length with the coherence length (69). Using the estimate

Near the cyclotron resonance ˜ω = 0 we keep in (98) only the terms proportional to 1/˜ω2. We consider

two separate case depending on whether µ is larger or smaller than unity.

For µ < 1 (i.e. near the neutron star surface) using the short wave length asymptotics of the Alfv´en

10.2. Excitation of the X wave

(110) was also obtained for the case of parallel propagation (88). As we saw in Section 9.2 the hydrodynamic
instability on the X mode is unimportant.

10.3. Excitation of the O mode

10.3.1. Cherenkov resonance ( µ > 1)

Starting with (98) we expand the plasma part near the dispersion relation for O mode (12) and the

ωB O
beam part near Cherenkov resonance (70) n = 1/(βb cos θ). In the low frequency approximation ω
wave can be excited by Cherenkov resonance only if µ > 1. We distinguish two cases: µ
1. In
1 and µ
the former case the resonance occurs at approximately cross-over point for the O wave while in the latter
case the resonance occurs at ω

The growth rate is proportional to the angle of propagation with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld. This is
due to the increase of the potential part of the O mode with the angle. The case of µ = 1 corresponds to
the unlikely case when the beam velocity is exactly equal to the Alfv´en velocity. The growth rate (111) is
valid for θ < 1/γb. For all practical purposes this growth rate is very small.

10.3.2. Cyclotron excitation of the O mode

The growth rate for the cyclotron excitation of the O mode in the hydrodynamic regime may be
estimated from the growth rate for the cyclotron excitation of the X mode (109) with the resonant frequency
given in Table 3. The maximum growth rate is reached for the parallel propagation and is equal to the
cyclotron growth rate of the X mode (109). The growth rate (109) decreases with the increase of the

– 29 –

resonant frequency. Since the cyclotron resonance on the O mode happens at the frequencies larger than
the the cyclotron resonance on the X mode, the corresponding growth rate of the O mode are smaller for
oblique propagation.

We conclude this section by the table of the hydrodynamic growth rate in a cold plasma (Table 4).

11. Relativistic Pair Plasma: Resonances

From the low frequency approximation to the Alfv´en waves dispersion we ﬁnd that the possibility of

Cherenkov excitation of Alfv´en wave in a relativistic hot plasma depends on the parameter

Numerically µh and µ are equal for the chosen set of the ﬁducial numbers for the cold and hot cases.

Similarly to the cold case, the parameter µh determines the possibility of the excitation of the Alfv´en
and O waves. If µh < 1 then the O wave cannot be excited by Cherenkov resonance. In this case the Alfv´en
wave may be excited by the Cherenkov interaction subject to the condition that the resonance occurs on
the parts of the dispersion curve that are not strongly damped (see below). If µh > 1 then the O wave may

√ Tpωp

.

Another limitation on the possible resonance comes from the requirement that the waves in the plasma
are not strongly damped at the location of the resonance. This is an important constraint on the resonance
of the Alfv´en wave, which is strongly damped at large wave vectors.

Using the dispersion relation for the Alfv´en waves in the limit kc

ωp, we ﬁnd that the cyclotron

resonance on the Alfv´en wave occurs at kc

ωp for the angles of propagation larger than

From (125) and (89) if follows that the cyclotron excitation of the transverse waves in the hydrodynamic

regime is not aﬀected by the relativistic temperature of the plasma particles and is not important in the
pulsar magnetosphere.

Similarly to the cold case we omit the details of the calculations of the growth rates and conclude this

section by the table of the hydrodynamic growth rates in the relativistic hot pair plasma Table 6.

We give here the growth rates for the Cherenkov excitation of the Alfv´en mode in the limit µh ≪
Then we can use the inﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld approximation to the dispersion of Alfv´en waves. We then
expand the plasma part of the the dielectric tensor (43) in large gyrofrequency keeping the zeroth order (

13.1.2. Cyclotron excitation of Alfv´en wave

Following the same procedure as in Section 13.1.1 we ﬁnd equation governing the cyclotron excitation
of Alfv´en wave in the relativistic pair plasma in the case when the plasma part of the dispersion relation

for the Alfv´en wave is calculated in the inﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld limit. Assuming that 1

occurring at frequencies ω
satisﬁed only for warm plasma ( η > 1). We can analytically ﬁnd the growth rate in this case for the angles

regimes: µh ≥
frequency. In this limit the O mode is quasi transverse and Cherenkov excitation is unimportant.

1. In the former case the resonant frequency is much larger that the cross-over

The maximum growth rate is reached for the parallel propagation (51). In Section 10.3.1 we found

(128)

(129)

– 36 –

that in cold plasma the Cherenkov growth of the O mode is unimportant due to the very short coherence
length, which is, in turn, limited by the small range of angles of the growing waves. Since the hydrodynamic
growth rate of the O mode in hot plasma is smaller than in cold plasma, we can make a conclusion that this
instability is unimportant.

13.3.2. Cyclotron excitation of the O mode

Similarly to the case of a cold plasma, the growth rate for the cyclotron excitation of the O mode may
be estimated from the growth rate of the X mode with the resonant frequency given in Table 5. The growth
rate has a maximum for the parallel propagation and decreases with the angle due to the sharp increase of
the resonant frequency.

We conclude this section by the table of the hydrodynamic growth rates in the relativistically hot pair

plasma (Table 6).

14. Kinetic Instabilities

As we have discussed in Section 7, a general beam instability may be treated analytically in the
hydrodynamic and kinetic limiting cases. We have considered hydrodynamic beam instabilities in pair
plasma in Sections 10 and 12. Now we turn to the kinetic regime of instabilities. The condition for the
kinetic consideration to apply is the opposite of the condition (63). It requires a substantial scatter in the
velocities of the resonant particles. In what follows we assume that distribution of the beam particles is
described by the relativistic, one-dimensional Maxwellian distribution:

f (pz) = nb

where nb is the density of the beam measured in the laboratory frame (the Lorentz invariant proper density
is nbγb), U µ = (γb, βbγb) is the four velocity of the rest frame of the beam, Tb is the beam temperature in
units mc2, K1 is a modiﬁed Bessel function.

This function may be simpliﬁed in the limit of cold beam (in its frame) Tb ≪

1 and large streaming

The kinetic growth rates (146) and (147) can be compared with growth rates in hydrodynamic
regime (Eqns (83) and (87)). In a hydrodynamic regime both cyclotron and Cherenkov growth rates are
proportional to the negative powers of the particle’s Lorentz factor. This is a signiﬁcant factor for the
primary beam and for the particles from the tail of plasma distributions. In contrast, kinetic growth rates
(146) and (147) are not suppressed by the relativistic streaming of resonant particles. On the other hand,
kinetic growth rates (146) and (147) scale linearly with a small ratio of the beam density to plasma density
while hydrodynamic growth rates (83) and (87) are proportional to 1/3 and 1/2 power of this ratio.

14.2. Excitation of Oblique Alfv´en Waves in a Kinetic Regime

14.2.1. Cherenkov Resonance

the growth rate is decreased by a factor T 2
p .

This growth rate is very small. Alfv´en waves in the limit ω

ωp are almost transverse and are

not excited eﬀectively by the Cherenkov resonance. A strong dependence on ω and θ corresponds to the
increasing potential part of Alfv´en waves for larger ω and θ.

. This condition may be satisﬁed only in the outer regions of the
pulsar magnetosphere. The growth rate of the Cherenkov excitation of the O mode in the kinetic regime is
proportional to the density of the resonant particles. In the outer parts of pulsar magnetosphere, the density
has decreased considerably which prevents the development of the Cherenkov instability. Numerically, it
turns out that in the pulsar magnetosphere the kinetic instabilities may be stronger than hydrodynamic.

15. Hydrodynamic Versus Kinetic Instabilities

Having calculated the growth rates for the hydrodynamic and kinetic regimes of the Cherenkov and

cyclotron instabilities, we can check whether the conditions of the corresponding regimes are satisﬁed.

15.1. Cherenkov Resonance

The condition of the hydrodynamic regime for the Cherenkov excitation is given by (64) with ν = 0
(the condition for the kinetic regime is reversed). We can distinguish two separate cases: when the scatter
in velocity of the resonant particles is due to the the scatter in parallel velocity or to the scatter in pitch

for the hydrodynamic-type Cherenkov instability:

which is well satisﬁed for the chosen plasma parameters.

p

In the case when the scatter in pitch angles dominates over the scatter in parallel velocity the condition

for the hydrodynamic type Cherenkov instability reads

This is not satisﬁed. This implies that if the primary beam does not acquire any signiﬁcant transverse
gyrational energy as it propagates out in the pulsar magnetosphere, then the Cherenkov-type instabilities
occur in the hydrodynamic regime.

p

We can also verify that the condition for the kinetic growth of the beam without any scatter in pitch
angles is not satisﬁed. The inverse of the condition (64) with the parallel growth rate in the kinetic regime
(151) give the following condition for the validity of the kinetic approximation

We conclude that the Cherenkov instability for the parallel propagation is in the hydrodynamic regime.

From these estimates we conclude that the cyclotron instability in the pulsar magnetosphere occurs in

that occur in a hydrodynamic regime.

This diﬀerence is very important for the theories of the pulsar radio emission. The kinetic instabilities,
in contrast to the hydrodynamic, are not suppressed by the large relativistic factor of the resonant particles.
Thus, the kinetic instabilities are more favorable as a possible source of the pulsar radio emission.

It is possible to illustrate graphically the diﬀerence between the hydrodynamic regime of the Cherenkov
instability and the kinetic regime of the cyclotron instability. On the frequency-wave vector diagram for the
O mode (Fig. 8), the dispersion curves of the cyclotron wave in the beam ω = kvb cos θ
ωB/γb is almost
parallel to the dispersion curves of the excited waves in plasma at the location of the resonance. Thus,
a small change in the velocity of the resonant particles results in a considerable change of the resonant
frequency. This vindicates the kinetic approximation that requires a large bandwidth of the growing waves.

16. Conclusion

In this work we considered normal modes and wave excitation in the strongly magnetized electron-
positron plasma of the pulsar magnetosphere. We found the location of resonances and calculated the
growth rates for the Cherenkov and cyclotron excitation of the O, X and Alfv´en waves in two limiting
regimes of hydrodynamic and kinetic instabilities taking into account angular dependence of the growth
rates. The main results of the paper are
(i) Cherenkov instabilities develop in the hydrodynamic regime while cyclotron instabilities develop in the
kinetic regime.
(ii) Cherenkov instability on the primary beam develops on the Alfv´en waves in the regions close to the
stellar surface and on the O mode in the outer regions of the pulsar magnetosphere (73), (115).
(iii) Cyclotron instability can develop on all three wave branches. On the Alfv´en branch, the cyclotron
instability does not develop in a very hot plasma (117).
(iv) The typical range of angles (in the plasma frame) with the highest growth rates are

p/ω2

B for Cherenkov excitation of the O mode

1/γb for Cherenkov excitation of the Alfv´en mode

(v) We also note, that Cherenkov instability due to the relative drift of the plasma particles can develop
only on the Alfv´en mode.

These arguments suggest that electromagnetic cyclotron instabilities are more likely to develop in the

pulsar magnetosphere than electrostatic.

We seek an appropriate expression for the relativistic one dimensional distribution. The aim of

this Appendix is to deﬁne the relevant physical quantities measured in diﬀerent systems. The relation
obtained in the Appendix are extensively used in Section 6 when considering the properties of waves in a
relativistically hot plasma.

Relativistic covariant dispersion relations for plasma waves have been considered by Godfrey et al. 1974,

Melrose 1982 and others (see reference in Melrose 1982). The general expression for the frame-invariant
distribution function is

here µ is a chemical potential, βT = 1/T ), T is invariant temperature, p is the momentum of the particle,
pν is a four-momentum of the particle and Uν is four velocity of the reference frame (speed of light and
particle mass are set to unity in this Appendix).

Next we deﬁne a ﬂux four-vector:

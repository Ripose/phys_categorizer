Abstract. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability plays an important role in the dynamics of several astronomical objects, in particular,
in supernovae (SN) evolution. In this paper we develop an analytical approach to study the stability analysis of spherical
expansion of the SN ejecta by using a special transformation in the co-moving coordinate frame. We ﬁrst study a non-stationary
spherical expansion of a gas shell under the pressure of a central source. Then we analyze its stability with respect to a no radial,
non spherically symmetric perturbation of the of the shell. We consider the case where the polytropic constant of the SN shell
is γ = 5/3 and we examine the evolution of a arbitrary shell perturbation. The dispersion relation is derived. The growth rate of
the perturbation is found and its temporal and spatial evolution is discussed. The stability domain depends on the ejecta shell
thickness, its acceleration, and the perturbation wavelength.

1. Introduction

The Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) is a common phenomena in supernovae evolution. For a type II supernova (SN), the
neutrino-driven RTI is predicted during the core collapse. It is excited at the discontinuity surface between the stalled shock wave
and the neutrino sphere (Janka & M¨uller 1996). In supernovae interiors, for example for the SN 1987A (Fryxell et al. 1991), the
RTI is thought to be responsible for the mixing of the heavy elements (Ni, Si) with the light ones (He, H). This mixing process
allows one to obtain a better interpretation of the light curve of the SN 1987A.

In this paper we consider the type II SN explosion. When the thermonuclear reactions cannot supply anymore the energy
required to maintain the pressure equilibrium in the star, its core collapses and produces a neutron star at its center. If the rotation
axis and the magnetic ﬁeld lines are not parallel inside the neutron star, the former becomes a pulsar which gradually converts
the spinning energy into a ﬂux of electromagnetic waves and high energy particles. This pulsar wind blows up the inner layers
of the supernova and creates a dense shell expanding in the circumstellar medium – the SN remnant (SNR). This structure of a
shell expanding under the pressure of a central pulsar is called a plerion (Wieler & Panagia 1980).

This object experiences several hydrodynamic instabilities, especially, the inner shell surface is RT unstable during the ac-
celeration phase. It is suggested that the RTI at the inner ejecta surface is responsible for the shell fragmentation and for the
ﬁlamentary structure in the Crab nebula (Hester et al. 1996). For type Ia and type II SNe, the RTI arises also at the outer surface
of an old SNR when the ejected shell is decelerated by the interstellar medium (Vel´azquez et al. 1998; Chevalier et al. 1992;
Herant et al. 1991). The plerion stability analysis is complicated for the pulsar pressure is non stationary, the density distribution
in the shell is not uniform and, in addition, one has to take into account the velocity of the shell since it is in rapid expansion.

Although the RTI has been studied for a long time since the pioneering work of Lord Rayleigh (Rayleigh 1992)
and Sir G. Taylor (Taylor 1950), only a limited number of exact analytical solutions is known. However, the application
of the RTI to the SN explosion, has been considered earlier by Bernstein and Book (Bernstein & Book 1978), Reynolds
and Chevalier (Reynolds & Chevalier 1984) and Blondin et al. (Blondin et al. 2001). Similar studies about the stability
of target implosions have also been performed in the ﬁeld of inertial conﬁnement fusion (Hattori et al. 1986; Han 1991;
Goncharov et al. 2000) (ICF). In these both domains the hydrodynamic instabilities develop in spherical geometry. Although
the spatial and temporal scales as well as signs of the shell velocity and acceleration are diﬀerent, the qualitative results of both
series of publications are comparable.

However, the stability analysis is not completed yet. The study by Hattori et al. (Hattori et al. 1986) is limited to the stagnation
period of the shell evolution and it assumes a uniform density proﬁle. Bernstein and Book (Bernstein & Book 1978) carried out
the study of the RTI for a shell in expansion, but they considered only an asymptotic limit of the RTI growth rate. Blondin et

2

al. (Blondin et al. 2001) considered only the instabilities that occur in the late phase of the SN evolution, when the ejecta shell
is decelerated outside the pulsar nebula. The present paper provides another aspect of the study, i.e., the early stage of the SNR
evolution when the shell is accelerated (and its thickness increases - see later) by the pulsar wind. On the other hand, this approach
works also for the description in the compression of a collapsing shell.

In this paper, Section 2 provides the basic equations in the co-moving frame. Trough this procedure, we transform the non-
stationary evolution of the shell into a steady motion. We perform the stability analysis for the case of an ideal mono-atomic gas.
An analytical solution for the unperturbed spherically-symmetric ﬂow is given in Section 3. We present the geometry and discuss
about the physical parameters relevant to the conditions of a pulsar nebula-supernova remnant interaction. The stability analysis
is performed in the co-moving coordinate frame and the dispersion relation is obtained in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to the
numerical study of the dispersion relation and the nature of the unstable solution is studied in details in section 6. The temporal
evolution of the shell outer and inner surfaces are analyzed in Section 7. The conclusions are given in Section 8.

Let us consider a spatio-temporal evolution of the shell expanding under the central pulsar pressure. Our model equations consist
in the continuity and Euler equations for the gas density ρ and the velocity v:

where vr, vθ and vφ are respectively the radial, azimuthal and tangential component of the velocity v. Even for a radially symmetric
ﬂow this system of equations is diﬃcult to solve because of the non-stationary character of the evolution.

Eqs.

(1) and (2) are solved by using a time-dependent

transformation initially introduced by Munier and
Feix (Munier & Feix 1983) and, thereafter by Bouquet et al. (Bouquet et al. 1985; Blottiau et al. 1988) and nowadays referred
in astrophysics as ’zooming coordinates’ (Hanawa & Matsumoto 2000; Hennebelle 2001; Shadmehri & Ghanbari 2001). It is a
speciﬁc coordinate transformation from the laboratory space to the co-moving, radially expanding frame. This new space is
labelled with a hat symbol and it is deﬁned by the following relations:

where A, B, C, D are the time dependent scaling functions; ˆρ and ˆp are the density and pressure in the co-moving frame depend-
ing on ˆr, ˆθ, ˆφ and ˆt. The velocity ˆv in the new frame is given by the classical deﬁnition:

r = C(t) ˆr,
ρ = D(t) ˆρ,

φ = ˆφ,

θ = ˆθ,
p = B(t) ˆp,

dt = A2(t) d ˆt,

According to Eq. (3), the velocity transformation reads:

where the dot stands for the time derivative. These two reference frames coincide at t = ˆt = 0, that is: A(0) = B(0) = C(0) =
D(0) = 1. In the new frame the equation of state reads ˆp = (Dγ/B)K ˆργ and Eqs. (1) and (2) become:

where Ω1, N, Ω2 and τ are the source terms arose due to the non-inertial nature of the new reference frame. We have:

where Ωi(i = 1, 2) has the dimension of a frequency, τ is a time and N is a dimensionless number. The scaling functions
A, B, C, D can be found from invariance considerations and conservation laws.

First of all, we are going to require that the EOS in the new frame remains invariant compared to the EOS in the initial
frame. In other words, the ﬂuid keep the same thermodynamical properties in the new space as in the physical one. The condition
ˆp = K ˆργ implies that Dγ/B = 1 and, therefore, B = Dγ. This is the ﬁrst constraint for the scaling function.

Second, requesting the same property for the continuity equation, i.e., the amount of matter is preserved from one space to the
other, one deduces Ω1 = 0 and we obtain D = (1/C)3. The single equation left is the equation of motion. In order to keep invariant
the pressure gradient force which originates from fundamental physics laws in the initial space, we take N = 1. Combining the
former three relations for the scaling functions, one has (Ribeyre et al. 2005):

At this stage, we have expressed the three scaling functions A, B, and D in terms of the single one, C, which is the function
governing the scaling between the radial coordinates r and ˆr. However we have to satisfy two more conditions: the coeﬃcients
in the friction term and in the radial forces in Eq. (7) become respectively:

A = C(3γ

In order to have a stationary ﬂow in the co-moving frame, both parameters τ and Ω2 should be constant. An inspection of Eqs. (9)
and (10) shows that the only way to satisfy these two constraints is to set Ω2 = 0 by choosing the polytropic constant γ = 5/3
which corresponds to a mono-atomic ideal gas. Then, the friction force (proportional to ˆv) vanishes in Eq. (6). Finally, the scaling
function C(t) is obtained from the resolution of the diﬀerential equation (10) and A(t), B(t) and D(t) are derived from Eq. (8).
This is the simplest case, which allows an analytical study of the instability development for a non-stationary regime in the space
(r, θ, φ, t).

For another value of γ (γ , 5/3), the scale function C is still deﬁned by Eq. (10), but then the function Ω2(t) is neither zero
nor constant and it accounts for an eﬀective friction force in the co-moving frame. However, this approach is not very fruitful
since a time-dependant coeﬃcient appears in the rescaled equations and the problem becomes more complex in the (ˆr, ˆt)-space
than the initial one.

This result is clearly in apposition with our procedure which consists in making more simple a initial complex problem.

3. Unperturbed ﬂow solution

With this choice of γ all coeﬃcients in (6) and (7) are constants and one may look for a static, radially-symmetric solution for
these equations in the co-moving frame. It can be found by setting ˆv(ˆr, ˆt)
ˆp0(ˆr). Then the
solution reads:

In the case of a mono-atomic gas where γ = 5/3, the solution to Eq. (10) is fully analytic and it is of most interest for a wide

class of astronomical objects (Bernstein & Book 1978; van der Swaluw et al. 2004). The scaling function C reads:

The solution describes a bubble expansion, with density and pressure decreasing with time while the radius increases. The
velocity increases linearly within the bubble. The ﬂow is compressible and its divergence,

From the above solution one can construct a model for a supernova remnant blown-up by a pulsar wind. For that we remove
the inner part of the bubble within the sphere of radius ˆr0 < ˆr1 in the co-moving frame. The pressure of the removed ﬂuid
is replaced by a radiative pressure, on the inner surface of the shell, attributed to the pulsar wind. The solution corresponding,
therefore, to an expanding shell in the laboratory frame is shown in Fig. 3. The inner (resp. outer) radius is given by r0(t) = C(t) ˆr0
[resp. r1(t) = C(t) ˆr1].

The density, pressure and velocity proﬁles in the shell follow directly from Eqs. (14) - (16). They are given in Fig. 3. The
ˆr0 is the initial shell thickness. The pressure law at the inner interface of

distance from the expansion center, v
r. On the other hand, these observations indicate that the ﬁlaments have been accelerated.
It turns out that this behavior can be probably ﬁtted with our analytical model by an appropriate adjustment of the parameters β
and τ.

4. Study of the shell stability

In this section we study the linear stability of the expanding shell against Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) type perturbations, assuming
that the shell is accelerated by the pulsar wind pressure. As a matter of fact, this conﬁguration is RT unstable for the light ﬂuid
(radiation) which pushes the heavy ﬂuid (shell of the supernova remnant). As it is shown in Fig. 4, small perturbations at the
inner surface might grow during the acceleration phase and eventually break down the shell.

The stability analysis of the shell in the laboratory frame is complicated since the background ﬂow is non-stationary and the
density and pressure vary with time and space. This analysis is much more simple in the co-moving frame since the unperturbed
shell there is at rest. We deﬁne any perturbed physical quantity ˆq(ˆr, ˆθ, ˆφ, ˆt) = ˆq0(ˆr) + δ ˆq(ˆr, θ, φ, ˆt) where δ ˆq(ˆr, θ, φ, ˆt) is the
perturbation in the (ˆr, ˆt)-space, and the perturbed position of the inner boundary is δˆr = ˆη(θ, φ, ˆt). Since Ω1 = 0 and assuming
γ = 5/3, i.e., Ω2 = 0, one then obtains the following set of linearized hydrodynamic equations [Eqs. (6)-(7)]:

One needs also to take into account the boundary conditions at the interfaces ˆr0 and ˆr1. Let us assume that each of interfaces

This is a linear PDE with time-independent coeﬃcients. One is therefore allowed to consider an exponential time dependence

With C1 and C2 given by Eqs. (38) and (39), the solution (35) is completely deﬁned. It depends on the mode number l, on the
position of the inner surface R0 and on the free parameter ω. The latter should be deﬁned from the remaining boundary conditions
at the outer interface R = R1. The perturbations of the motion both interfaces (R = R0 and R = R1 = 1) cannot be taken initially
R1 = 1 one
independently, and cannot further evolve independently. Indeed, from ﬁrst equation (37) at the outer surface R
ﬁnds:

≡

Notice that this relation does not forbid the calculation of the divergence of S near the outer boundary, because the density and
the sound speed of the unperturbed ﬂow go to zero there. Since in Eq. (35), P and Q are rational functions of y = √1
R2, one
can expand S in Taylor series for y

0 and Eq. (40) becomes:

−

The ﬁrst term in the right hand side of (41) diverges if the numerator is non-zero. Therefore, the only way to satisfy this boundary
condition and to obtain a ﬁnite displacement at the outer surface is setting the numerator to zero. This condition C1P(1)+C2Q(1) =
0 corresponds to the dispersion relation for the shell instability we are looking for. Using the explicit formulae for C1 and C2, we
obtain:

It will be shown later in Sec. 6 that provided (42) is satisﬁed, the second boundary condition at the outer edge is also immediately
satisﬁed.

Equation (42) provides a relation between the growth rate of the instability, ω, and the mode number l. It is independent of
the azimuthal number m, because the unperturbed system is spherically-symmetric and it will be shown later that, in addition, it
does not depend on the shell inner radius R0.

Moreover, from Eq. (41) one obtains also a relation between the displacements at the shell surfaces:

5. Numerical solution of the dispersion relation

The dispersion equation (42) looks rather complicated and we ﬁrst consider its numerical solution. For this purpose, we represent
∆2 = ω2 is the
it as a relation between two functions, FL(∆) = FR(∆), depending on the parameter ∆. Here, FL(∆) = l(l + 1) + 4
left hand side of Eq. (42) and FR(∆), its right hand side. In Fig. 5, FL and FR are plotted as a function of the variable ∆ and we
search for the intersection points of these two functions for given parameters l and R0. In order to have an unstable solution (ω2
should be real and positive) the intersection must occur in the upper right part of the plane (FR,L; ∆) : 0 < ∆ < √l(l + 1) + 4 = ∆m
and 0 < FR < l(l + 1) + 4. This deﬁnes the upper limit for the growth rate for a given l: ω2 < [l(l + 1) + 4]/3. To have a stable
solution, the intersection must occur in the lower right part of the plane (FR,L; ∆) : 0 < ∆ < √l(l + 1) + 4 = ∆m and FR < 0.
These restrictions are useful to constrain the numerical solution of the dispersion equation.

−

An example of curves FR, FL is shown in Fig. 5. Both curves are surprisingly simple. The left function FL is just a parabola
which has a maximum at ∆ = 0 and becomes negative for ∆ > ∆m. The right hand side has also a maximum at ∆ = 0 and it
decreases with ∆. There are two intersection points: one corresponds to ω2 > 0 (unstable mode) and another one to ω2 < 0
(oscillating mode at ∆ = 6 for the present mode). The numerical solution indicates that both intersection points are independent
of the shell thickness R0. Especially, the point corresponding to unstable solutions is always located at ∆ = 3 for chosen value
l = 4. It will be shown below that this is a consequence of the nature of the perturbed ﬂow.

6. Behavior of the perturbed ﬂow

Until now, we have considered a general solution for the perturbed ﬂow, without any assumption about its nature. Especially, we
have been working with equations including compressible eﬀects. However, this rather simple solution for the instability growth
may suggest that special properties should probably arise. In this section we are going to study the properties of the perturbed
ﬂow.

Since ∂θ(sin θ∂θYlm)/ sin θ + (∂2

φYlm)/ sin2 θ =

l(l + 1)Ylm, and after the injection of the second derivative of S , d2S /dR2

obtained from Eq. (31), the divergence of the perturbed velocity δ ˆV [given by Eqs. (36)] reads,

Ylm .

It is worth to note that from the second boundary condition (37) the velocity divergence is zero at the boundaries. Now, we make
a stronger assumption. Let us assume that the ﬂow is incompressible everywhere, i.e., div δ ˆV = 0 for any value of the radius
R. Then, from (44) we can express the ﬁrst derivative of S , dS /dR, in terms of S ans R and we can compute d2S /dR2, as well.
Plugging these derivatives in the perturbation equation (31), we ﬁnd after some simpliﬁcations that the coeﬃcient in front of S
does not depend on R and the diﬀerential equation reduces to a simple algebraic relation between ω and l :

ω4

ω2

−

−

l(l + 1) = 0.

This relation is a consistency condition between the eigenmode equation (31) [it is automatically satisﬁed] and our additional
constraint coming from (44), i.e., requiring that δ ˆV = 0 everywhere inside the shell. It is also consistent with the boundary
conditions (37). Therefore Eq. (45) can be considered as the dispersion relation. We have to admit that up to now we have not
been able to ﬁnd a solution to Eq. (31), satisfying (37), that diﬀers from the one providing a zero divergence of the perturbed
velocity. In other words the solution that is “constrained” by the boundary conditions (37) describes an incompressible RT
perturbation for which the dispersion relation is given by (45).

The solutions of this quartic polynomial equation read easily :

Moreover, it should be emphasized that these solutions perfectly agree with the solutions of the general dispersion equation (42)
found numerically in the previous section. As a matter of fact, for l = 4 we have found numerically ω2 = 5 and ω2 =
4 leading
to ω =
2i, respectively. These values are those exactly obtained from (46) by replacing l with the speciﬁc value
l = 4.

As consequence, the solution we have found assuming a velocity proﬁle with a divergence equal to zero does not look anymore
as a “trick” to satisfy the whole set of constraints. This result is the proof that the RT unstable ﬂow is indeed incompressible and
the growth rate is unexpectively independent on the shell thickness. This result is quite new and is shown here in this paper
for the ﬁrst time, although some people studied before in details thin and thick shells (see for instance the monography by
Kull (Kull 1991). All the modes are unstable for any value of the mode number l and the most unstable growth rate, ω(l), among
ω1(l) and ω2(l), is shown in Fig. 6.

In addition, one can easily check that the ﬂow is irrotational. This property arises since the unperturbed ﬂow is radial. The
vorticity of the perturbed ﬂow in the laboratory frame (5) is given by: curl δv = curl δˆv/C(t) since A(t) = C(t). As curl δˆv = 0
from Eqs. (36), the perturbed ﬂow is therefore also irrotational in the “physical” space.

7. Evolution of the shell perturbations

The eﬀect of the instability can be further analyzed by observing the deformation ˆξ of the shell. It can be calculated from the veloc-
ity ﬁeld in the rescaled frame by using the relation d ˆξ/d ˆt = δˆv which provides ˆξ(ˆr, θ, φ, ˆt) = (τ/ω)δˆv = (τ/ω) exp(ωˆt/τ)δ ˆV(ˆr, θ, φ),
where δ ˆV is given by (36). Since the dispersion equation has four roots (46), the general solution for the displacement is a linear
superposition of four modes. In particular, for the radial displacement, one has :

ˆξr(R, θ, φ, ˆt) = ˆa0

are the displacement eigenmodes and Λi are the mode amplitudes (Λ1,2 are real, Λ3 = Λ∗4). Moreover, as the function S depends
on ω2 then ˆξ1 = ˆξ2 and ˆξ3 = ˆξ4. We have ˆξi(R0) = 1 also. This equality comes from the normalization of ˆξi(R) with the inner
initial displacement ˆa0 (see Section 4). Then ˆξi(1) is given by Eq. (43).

At this stage, we can calculate the deformation of the shell in the initial space (R, θ, φ, t). From the scaling relation for the

distances [ﬁrst equation of Eqs. (3)] and from the relation (13) between t and ˆt, the radial displacement ξr(R, θ, φ, t) writes :

ξr(R, θ, φ, t) = a0 C(t)Ylm(θ, φ)

where a0 = C(0)ˆa0 = ˆa0. The radial velocity perturbation is provided by Eq.(5) with A(t) = C(t) since γ = 5/3 :

where δ ˆV is given by Eqs. (36). The derivation of (49) requires further details. The velocities v(r, t) and ˆv(ˆr, ˆt) in the (r, t)
and (ˆr, ˆt) spaces, respectively, are connected through Eq. (5). In (ˆr, ˆt), we have ˆv(ˆr, ˆt) = δˆv, while the corresponding equation
is v(r, t) = δv + v0(r, t) in (r, t) where δv is the velocity perturbation and where v0(r, t) is the background velocity given by
v0(r, t) = ˙C(t)r/C(t). Introducing these expression in (5), one obtains (49) immediately. In addition, we are going to introduce
the quantity δV(r, t) related to δv by δv = δV exp[ωg(t)] (this relation is similar to the relation between δˆv and δ ˆV).

It is now possible to derive the constants Λi (i = 1, 4) from the initial velocity perturbation proﬁle in the physical space.
In the hat space, the radial velocity δˆvr is given by δ ˆvr = d ˆξr/d ˆt. On the other hand since we have δVr(R, 0) = δ ˆVr(R, 0) at
t = ˆt = 0 and for θ = φ = 0, the Λi’s can be calculated from the boundary conditions taken as ξr(R0, 0) = a0 D0, ξr(1, 0) = a0 D1,
δVr(R0, 0) = a0 V0, δVr(1, 0) = a0 V1 in the physical space where D0, D1, V0 and V1 are four arbitrary parameters. Solving the
corresponding system of equations, we ﬁnd :

The numerical model/code employed here is called Pansy (McCrory et al. 1977). It computes the time development of three-
dimensional modes of coupled hydrodynamic, thermodynamic, and transport phenomena, including heat ﬂow, viscosity, fully
linearized about zeroth order spherically or cylindrically symmetric compressible ﬂows. The zeroth order solutions are calcu-
lated on a typical one-dimensional lagrangian grid and have the form f j(t), where the f ’ s are all of the necessary hydrodynamic
variables, and other variables including zone radius, and where j is the radial zone index. First order quantities, of the form
f j
l,m(t)Yl,m(θ) exp (imφ) for spherical geometry, are calculated with diﬀerence equations which are linearly perturbed forms of
the former discretized zeroth order equations, rather than discretizations of the linearly perturbed continuous zeroth order equa-
tions. This relatively conservative/Hamiltonian diﬀerencing approach produces considerably improved treatment of phenomena
requiring high resolution, especially artiﬁcial viscosity for shocks in contrast with earlier form of Pansy which required higher
resolution for the same accuracy (Henderson et al. 1974).

The analytical solution for the inner and outer shell displacement of the unstable mode has been compared with the simu-
lations performed with the perturbation code Pansy. The agreement between the analytical solution and the simulations is very
good. The diﬀerence is less than one percent. It is shown in Fig. 7 that the inner interface growth is more rapid because this
surface is RT unstable, while the outer interface is in contact with the vacuum and does not show a substantial growth. It looks
stable. The deviation between the theory and simulations at the outer surface is larger than at the inner interface because it is
more diﬃcult for the code to handle the contact with vacuum.

The asymptotic ampliﬁcation depends strongly on the initial velocity deﬁned by the parameter β [see Eq. (16)]. For example,
if β = 1, the shell experiences a monotonic expansion phase, and the ampliﬁcation decreases to 103. Therefore, the shell is less
1 the shell collapse initially and the ampliﬁcation would be 108. As a result, the shell becomes much
fragile. However, for β =
more fragile. We conclude therefore that most dangerous stage of the shell evolution is the stagnation phase, which has been
analyzed by Hattori et al. (Hattori et al. 1986).

The purely growing eigenmode that we have studied above corresponds to correlated perturbations between both surfaces
(inner and outer) which seems to be not too realistic. It would be more appropriate to consider either independent initial per-
turbations of the inner and outer surfaces or the perturbation of the inner surface only. According to (50) and (51), from four
incompressible modes one can construct any kind of initial perturbation. Let us consider a case where the inner and outer inter-
face displacements are opposite, i.e., D0 = 1, D1 =
1, V0 = V1 = 0. Hereafter we call this type of perturbation the “sausage”.
This “sausage” could be produced in the outer shell of the star by convection phenomena arising just before its explosion.

of the initial displacement within the shell is shown in Fig. (8d). The time evolution of such a shell perturbation in the laboratory
frame is shown in Fig. (8c) for the mode l = 4. We have normalized the displacement ξr by the scale function a0 C(t) just to
exhibit the ampliﬁcation due to the RTI and suppress the shell thickness expansion. The growing perturbation at the inner surface
of the shell due to the RTI is clearly shown, while the outer surface becomes spherical [see Fig. (8b)] because this interface is
stable. The perturbation grows for time period satisfying t < τ when the shell is accelerated and one can see that the displacement
is larger along the polar axis θ = 0 [X axis on Fig. (8b)].

Additional types of shell perturbations are interesting to study. Three of then exist : (i) the “kink” conﬁguration for which the
inner and outer initial perturbations are the same, D0 = D1 = 1, V0 = V1 = 0; (ii) the “inner” shell perturbation for which only
the inner interface is initially perturbed, D0 = 1, D1 = 0, V0 = V1 = 0; (iii) the “velocity” alteration for which the positions of
the inner and outer surfaces are initially unperturbed but just the inner velocity is perturbed, D0 = D1 = 0, V0 = 1, V1 = 0. This
conﬁguration describes, for instance, a wind pulsar ﬂux ﬂuctuation.

The relative weight of the unstable mode in each of perturbation is given by the constant Λ1. Hence, this parameter can
be used to compare the conﬁgurations. For the “sausage” case with R0 = 0.5 and l = 4 shown in Fig. 8, Λ1 = 0.56. For the
three other shell perturbations we ﬁnd : Λ1 = 0.43 (“kink”), Λ1 = 0.50 (“inner”), and Λ1 = 0.22 for the “velocity” case.
Therefore, all the three displacement perturbations conﬁgurations, “sausage”, ”kink” and ”inner” are equally unstable. However,
the ampliﬁcation coeﬃcient for these three modes is approximately twice smaller than for the growing single mode (Λ1 = 1 and

Λ j = 0, j = 2, 4). These modes can probably be excited more naturally from the supernova progenitor heterogeneities. Finally,
the ”velocity” perturbation seems to be the less unstable. Its ampliﬁcation coeﬃcient is more than four time smaller.

However, the respective importance of diﬀerent perturbations depend on the shell thickness and the mode number. For exam-
ple, for R0 = 0.9 and the same mode number l = 4 we ﬁnd: Λ1 = 1.41 for the “sausage” mode, Λ1 = 0.22 (“kink”), Λ1 = 0.80
(“inner”), and Λ1 = 0.36 (“velocity”). In this case, the “sausage” mode is the most dangerous and it grows even stronger than the
pure mode.

By knowing the mode ampliﬁcation coeﬃcient, one can conclude about the shell fragility. In other words, we are able to derive
a supernova shell fragmentation criterion due to the RTI. Assuming that the disruption of the shell occurs when the perturbation
amplitude becomes comparable to the shell thickness, this criterion deﬁnes the critical amplitude, acr, of the initial perturbation
for the shell disruption. We have immediately this criterion in the hat space, with Eq. (47) for θ = φ = 0, the displacement of the
inner interface on the X axis for the more unstable mode becomes : ˆξr(R0, 0, 0, t) = acrΛ1 exp[ω1g(t)] = (ˆr1 −

We can rewrite this criterion as :

This critical amplitude depends on the mode number l, the shell thickness, and the type of perturbation. The formula is valid for
low modes, l < lM = 2πR0/(1
R0), with a breaking occurring in the linear regime. The higher modes, l > lM, seem to be less
dangerous. Although their ampliﬁcation coeﬃcient can be large, the corresponding perturbation enters in non-linear regime and
grows less rapidly. In contrast, the lower modes, l < lM, are growing slowly and they lag behind the mode lM. Therefore, the
linear theory predicts that the most dangerous perturbation corresponds to the mode lM and the critical initial amplitude is given
by Eq. (52) where l is replaced with lM. For example, for R0 = 0.65 and β = 0 the most dangerous mode is lM ∼

As result, a perturbation amplitude as small as 0.24% of the inner radius would be large enough to disrupt the shell. Figure 9
shows the initial shell with the critical perturbation acr for a “inner” conﬁguration (panel a) and the shell close to disruption at
time t = 20τ (panel b). The theory predicts that the shell will break down near the pole (X-axis).

8. Discussion and conclusion

In the ﬁrst part of this paper, a non-stationary spherical ﬂow describing the expansion of SN ejecta has been derived by applying a
rescaling method (Bouquet et al. 1985) to the Euler equations for a polytropic gas. This is a non-stationary solution that describes
the motion of a shell with initial ﬁnite thickness L0. The shell dynamics is described by two parameters: the initial velocity β and
the expansion time τ. By changing the sign of β one may study implosions and explosions.

This solution is relevant for the description of the plerion evolution – type II SN remnant driven by a central pulsar pressure.
The temporal behavior of the pressure in our model is in agreement with the classical spin-down power law of the pulsar lumi-
nosity (Blondin et al. 2001). The parameter β takes into account the initial kinetic energy of the shell, which is released during
the explosion, and the time τ describes the life time of the pulsar at the center of the ejecta.

The transformation from the laboratory frame to the co-moving reference frame allowed us to perform an analytical study of
the 3D linear stability of this time-dependant radial ﬂow. The linearized hydrodynamic equations for a mono-atomic gas (γ = 5/3)
have been solved using a decomposition of the perturbation in spherical harmonics. The dispersion relation deﬁnes the growth
rate ω of any mode l in the co-moving frame, which corresponds to a ﬁnite ampliﬁcation in the laboratory frame. The growth rate
is independent of the shell thickness R0 and the azimuthal mode number m. Although no assumptions have been made concerning
the perturbed ﬂow, we found that the unstable perturbation is incompressible and irrotational. An analytical expressions for the
growth rate and the mode structure were conﬁrmed by comparison the analytical theory with numerical simulations performed
with the perturbation code PANSY (McCrory et al. 1977). The sign and the magnitude of the initial velocity play an important
role in the RTI development. High initial velocities stabilize the shell. In opposition, for the case of initially collapsing shell,
β < 0, the perturbation grows to much higher amplitudes.

By using a linear superposition of stable and unstable modes we studied the dependence of the ampliﬁcation coeﬃcient on the
initial decomposition. It was found that the deformation for a thick shell of the inner interface is most dangerous and corresponds
to a ampliﬁcation coeﬃcient twice smaller than for the unstable single mode. While for a thin shell the “sausage” conﬁguration
seems to be the more dangerous mode. For a given shell thickness R0, we deﬁned the mode lM which is the most dangerous for
the shell disruption. A criterion is derived that deﬁnes the critical initial inner surface deformation that produces a fragmentation
of the shell.

A ﬁlamentary structure in the Crab nebula expansion has been observed by Hester, (Hester et al. 1996) Sankrit et
al. (Sankrit et al. 1998). The structure of radial ﬁlament velocities indicates that they have a common origin - the SN spheri-
cal shell. Such a ﬁlamentary structure has been reproduced from numerical simulations by Jun (Jun 1998), who shows that the
RTI driven by the acceleration of the thin shell provides the main mechanism for the shell disruption. Our analytical model is in
a good agreement with these observations and numerical simulations. By considering a shell with the aspect ratio 10 (R0 = 0.9),

12

the same as in the paper (Jun 1998), we deduce that most dangerous mode is lM = 60. This agrees with the fastest growing mode
observed in Jun’s simulations. Moreover, the amplitude of initial perturbations (
1%) used in (Jun 1998) follows from Eq. (52)
for the realistic initial parameters: the velocity of shell is 500 km/s, the initial radius 0.2 pc, and the explosion time τ = 500 yrs
(this implies β = 1.3). This demonstration suggests that our analytical model is relevant to study the stability analysis of various
SN remnants.

Finally, this work can be applied to ICF or, more generally, to study of RTI in laser target design.
In this respect, this study is directly useful to Laboratory Astrophysics issues and it can be used to design appropriate laser

target to examine the RTI problem in SNR (Ribeyre 2006).

Production of antihydrogen atoms by mixing antiprotons with a cold, conﬁned, positron plasma
depends critically on parameters such as the plasma density and temperature. We discuss non-
destructive measurements, based on a novel, real-time analysis of excited, low-order plasma modes,
that provide comprehensive characterization of the positron plasma in the ATHENA antihydrogen
apparatus. The plasma length, radius, density, and total particle number are obtained. Measure-
ment and control of plasma temperature variations, and the application to antihydrogen production
experiments are discussed.

The ATHENA collaboration recently produced and de-
tected cold antihydrogen atoms [1] at the CERN An-
tiproton Decelerator (AD) [2]. A similar result has been
subsequently reported by the ATRAP collaboration [3].
The antihydrogen was made by mixing low energy an-
tiprotons with a cold, dense positron plasma in a nested
Penning trap [4]. A knowledge of the characteristics of
the positron plasma is important for several reasons. The
most likely antihydrogen formation mechanisms, sponta-
neous recombination and three body recombination, have
diﬀerent dependences on both the density and the tem-
perature of the positron plasma [5]. Knowing these pa-
rameters is crucial in helping to elucidate the antihy-
drogen formation mechanism. Control and simultaneous
monitoring of the positron plasma temperature allow the
antihydrogen formation reaction to be eﬀectively turned
oﬀ while maintaining overlap between antiprotons and
positrons. This provides a good measurement of the to-
tal background signal for our unique antihydrogen de-
tector [1]. Furthermore, the space charge potential of a

suﬃciently dense (108 cm−3) and extensive (length 3 cm)
positron plasma considerably alters the eﬀective electro-
static potential in the positron trap and thus the dynam-
ics of the antiprotons in the nested trap.

Harmonically conﬁned one component plasmas at tem-
peratures close to absolute zero are known to form
spheroids of constant charge density [6]. In our case the
shape is a prolate ellipsoid characterized by the aspect
ratio α = zp/rp where zp and rp are the semi-major axis
and semi-minor axis respectively [Fig. 1(a)]. A cold ﬂuid
theory [7] relating the frequencies of the low-order plasma
modes to the density and the aspect ratio of spheroidal
plasmas was conﬁrmed experimentally for laser cooled
ion plasmas [8, 9] and successfully applied to cold elec-
tron plasmas [10]. Work on ﬁnite temperature electron
plasmas demonstrated that mode detection could be used
as a diagnostic of density and aspect ratio and that for a
plasma of known density and aspect ratio the frequency
of the quadrupole mode is dependent on the plasma tem-
perature [11, 12].

Here we describe an extension to the above work which
provides a non-destructive diagnostic based on measure-
ments of the ﬁrst two axial modes of a ﬁnite temperature
positron plasma. The diagnostic has no discernable eﬀect
on the normal evolution of the plasma, so it can be used

µV and the dwell time for each 5 kHz step is 3.96 ms.
The number of scan steps is usually 50. The choice of
scan width is a balance between following scan-to-scan
changes in mode frequency and avoiding perturbations
to the normal evolution of the plasma. To follow changes
in the plasma over a longer time scale an automatic fre-
quency tracking code has been implemented to allow the
excitation to be locked to the mode frequencies. For each
frequency step, the amplitude and phase (relative to that
of the driving signal) of the voltage induced by the plasma
motion are acquired. The cross talk signal between the
transmitting and receiving electrodes is acquired without
positrons and subtracted from the signal measured with
the plasma present.

The plasma number density n and aspect ratio α
can be extracted from the zero-temperature analytical
model [7] using the measured frequencies (ω1, ω2) of
the dipole and quadrupole modes. We have developed
an equivalent circuit model which explicitely includes
the plasma dimensions. This method yields directly the
plasma length when α and n are known.
In contrast
other equivalent circuit approaches utilizing tuned cir-
cuits and assuming small cloud dimensions measured the
[15]. Our
total number of particles in Penning traps
model describes the signal induced on an electrode by
the coherent oscillations of the dipole mode when an ex-
ternal driving force is applied. In particular we write [16]

The dimensionless functions gr and gt depend on the
shape of the plasma and on the geometry of the
trap. They describe the eﬀects of the ﬁnite plasma
extension both on the mode excitation and detection.
gt(α, zp)Vt/2rw is the electric ﬁeld acting on the cen-
ter of mass of the plasma when the dipole mode is ex-
cited by applying a voltage Vt to the transmitting elec-
trode with the other electrodes grounded. The func-
tion gr(α, zp) is related to the current Ir induced by the
dipole mode oscillation on the receiving electrode, Ir =
N egr(α, zp)vcm/2rw where vcm is the velocity of the par-
ticles due to the dipole mode and e is the positron (elec-
tron) charge. TL is obtained by measuring T ′
L = ATL
where A is the net gain of the electronics chain and it is
independent of the plasma properties. We used electrons
to ﬁne tune this parameter by comparing the number ob-
tained by this diagnostic with the number measured on
a Faraday cup. Electrons were chosen as they can be
loaded faster, with a wider range of total number N. The
inductance L of the equivalent circuit is related to the

during antihydrogen production. We have developed a
model in which the plasma length can be extracted from
the shape of the resonance when the dipole mode is ex-
cited. Thus the aspect ratio, density, and length can be
measured and the radius and positron number obtained.
We show that we can monitor induced changes in the
temperature while ensuring that the normal evolution of
other plasma parameters is not changed. Using this mon-
itor and suitable radio frequency excitation of the dipole
mode we can set the plasma temperature during the in-
teraction between positrons and antiprotons.

In ATHENA, the positrons and antiprotons are con-
ﬁned by cylindrical electrodes of radius rw=1.25 cm.
These are inserted in a cryostat and immersed in a 3
T magnetic ﬁeld. The positrons are held in the cen-
tral part of the trap by an harmonic axial potential [see
Fig. 1(b)]. In the high magnetic ﬁeld the positrons cool
by synchrotron radiation [13]. We have not measured
the temperature of the positron plasma but note that
the lower limit is set by the temperature of the trap elec-
trodes (15 K).

The ﬁrst two axial modes (dipole and quadrupole
modes) are excited by applying a sinusoidal perturbation
to one electrode with an electromotive force Vt = vtejωt.
The oscillation of the plasma induces a current in the
pick-up electrode [14, 15] and a voltage Vr = vr(ω)ejωt
is detected across the resistance Rr [Fig. 1(b)]. Exper-
imentally the ratio TL(ω) = vr(ω)/vt is measured as a
function of the drive frequency ω by means of a network
analyzer. A narrow step-wise frequency sweep is made of
the voltage source across the resonance frequency of each
mode. The excitation amplitude vt is of the order of 100

3

quency. The values of α, ωp and zp are evaluated in the
cold ﬂuid limit. Provided that these parameters do not
vary signiﬁcantly when the plasma temperature changes,
a measured shift in the quadrupole frequency can be used
to calculate the magnitude of the temperature change.

We have used the mode diagnostic system to investi-
gate the response of a cold and dense positron plasma
without antiprotons to heating, implemented by apply-
ing an excitation near the dipole frequency (21 MHz) to
one of the trap electrodes [Fig. 1(a)]. Oﬀ-resonance heat-
ing pulses were not eﬀective. The excitation is a variable
amplitude signal that is swept from 20 MHz to 22 MHz at
a repetition rate of about 1 kHz. This is done to ensure
that the dipole mode frequency is covered and that the
plasma reaches thermal equilibrium. Previous authors
report an equilibration rate of some tens of kHz in sim-
ilar conditions [17]. Figure 3 shows the behavior of the
quadrupole frequency when the initially cold plasma is
subjected to heating oﬀ/heating on cycles. Application
of the excitation results in a rapid, voltage-dependent
rise in the quadrupole frequency. When the excitation is
removed, the quadrupole frequency returns to a value in
step with the evolution of the unperturbed plasma which
is also shown in Fig. 3. The unperturbed plasma evolu-
tion is characterized by a slow decrease in the frequency
of the quadrupole mode and corresponding decrease in
aspect ratio and density. This is consistent with a slow
expansion of the plasma. The heating and the cooling
times are faster than our sampling interval resulting in
the observed discontinuities of the frequency shifts on the
time scale of Fig. 3.

Furthermore, for these heating amplitudes, without
antiprotons we observe no discernable positron loss with

α and n are determinated independently by the frequency

is related to Rs and zp by Eq. (2) and Eq. (1). Thus a
ﬁt to the measured transmitted power yields zp. The ra-
dius rp and the total number N can now be found. An
example of an application of this diagnostic to positrons
is shown in Fig. 2. Here the total number obtained with
the model is plotted against the number found by ex-
traction to a Faraday cup. In this regime the linearity
and good correspondence in the absolute number show
that both the model and its implementation constitute a
complete, real-time, non-destructive plasma diagnostic.

sity of about 1.7
cm long (2zp) with a radius of about 0.25 cm and a stor-
age time of several hundreds of seconds. The maximum
change in the plasma parameters during the mixing cycle
of 190 seconds was less than 10%.

Because of the importance of temperature in antihy-
drogen production, we have also investigated whether
this diagnostic system can be used to detect changes in
the plasma temperature. Previous authors have demon-
strated, with work on similar electron plasmas [11, 12],
that temperature changes manifest themselves in fre-
quency shifts of the quadrupole mode. In particular they

FIG. 4: (a) Time evolution of the quadrupole mode frequency during a heating oﬀ-on cycle. The diﬀerent frequency shifts
correspond to diﬀerent heating amplitudes Vd. The drift of the frequency in the unperturbed intervals is due to the plasma

our positron annihilation detector which covers a solid
80% of 4π [18]. Figure 4(a) shows the re-
angle of
sponse of the plasma quadrupole frequency during heat-
ing oﬀ/heating on cycles with diﬀerent amplitudes Vd of
generated heating voltage [directly proportional to Vh of
Fig. 1(a)]. Thus the dependence of temperature increase
∆T on Vd was found and the result is shown in Fig. 4(b).
For the data reported here the minimum measureable
temperature was about 15 meV due to the frequency
step size used (20 kHz). The minimum step size of 5
kHz would give a sensitivity of a few meV. The observed
linear dependence of the temperature rise on Vd, is in con-
trast with the linear dependance on the the power (and
thus on V 2
d ) that one would expect. This could be most
likely due to non linear eﬀects of the on-resonance heat-
ing. A nonlinear regime could also explain the fact that
the temperature rise in Fig. 4(b) appears to extrapolate
to zero at ﬁnite Vd.

The utility of the mode diagnostic system as applied
to antihydrogen production is immediately apparent if we
consider that the radiative reaction rate is proportional
to n and to T −1/2, while the three-body reaction rate
varies as n2 and T −9/2 [5]. In order to gain insight into
the experimental production mechanism and to ensure
reproducible results, careful monitoring of any changes in
these parameters is essential. The ability to reproducibly
add heat to the positron plasma, and to thereby control
the reaction rate, is also very desirable. We have already
utilized the heating and temperature diagnostic to “turn
oﬀ”antihydrogen production in ATHENA [1], providing
a useful null measurement.

all times when positrons are in the trap. The system is
wide band and does not require that any resonant cir-
cuitry be mounted internally on trap electrodes. We are
thus free to choose a wide range of depths for our har-
monic positron trap and are therefore able to tune the
shape of our positron plasma at will. Knowing the size
of the positron cloud is crucial to assuring a good spatial
overlap between antiprotons and positrons in the reac-
tion region. The space charge potential of our positron
plasma ﬂattens the potential inside its volume along the
z direction reducing the potential barrier seen by the an-
tiprotons in the mixing trap by several volts. Information
about the eﬀective potential is important in helping to
understand the antiproton cooling and interaction dy-
namics.

We have extended the plasma mode diagnostic method
to provide comprehensive characterization of a cold,
dense positron plasma employed in the ATHENA an-
tihydrogen experiment. The method has already been
utilized to great advantage in ATHENA, and promises
to be an essential element of future experiments. The
technique, while particularly useful for non-destructive
measurements on diﬃcult-to-produce species such as
positrons, has immediate applicability to other Penning
trap plasmas.

Nonlinear Debye-Onsager-Relaxation-Eﬀect

K. Morawetz

Fachbereich Physik, Universit¨at Rostock, 18051 Rostock, Germany

Abstract

The quantum kinetic equation for charged particles in strong electric ﬁelds is used
to derive the nonlinear particle ﬂux. The relaxation ﬁeld is calculated quantum
mechanically up to any order in the applied ﬁeld provided a given Maxwellian
plasma. The classical limit is given in analytical form. In the range of weak ﬁelds the
deformation of the screening cloud is responsible for the Debye-Onsager relaxation
eﬀect.

High ﬁeld transport has become a topic of current interest in various ﬁelds of
physics. Especially, the nonlinear current or the electrical conductivity gives
access to properties of dense nonideal plasmas. At low ﬁelds we expect the
linear response regime to be valid. Then the contribution of ﬁeld eﬀects to
the conductivity can be condensed into the Debye- Onsager relaxation eﬀect
[1–5] which was ﬁrst derived within the theory of electrolytes [6–8]. Debye has
given a limiting law of electrical conductivity which stated that the external
electric ﬁeld E on a charge e is diminished by the amount δE = E (1
−
κe2
6ǫ0T )where κ is the inverse screening radius of the screening cloud. Later it
has been shown by Onsager that this result has to be corrected if the dynamics
of ions is considered. In this paper we will give the complete result beyond
κe2
6ǫ0T F (E))similar to the theoretical
linear response for the static case E (1
explanation of the Wien eﬀect [8]. We start from the kinetic equation derived
with the help of the gauge invariant formulation of Green’s function, [9,10]

approximation resulting into a ﬁeld dependent Bethe-Salpeter equation or for
the RPA approximation [10] resulting into a Lenard-Balescu kinetic equation.
We are now interested in corrections to the particle ﬂux, and therefore obtain

We assume a nondegenerate situation, such that the Pauli blocking eﬀects
can be neglected and assume a quasistationary plasma with Maxwellian dis-
tributions, which in principle restricts the applied ﬁelds [13]. The angular

The second result we calculated for inclusion of dynamical screening within
the approximation [3] which replaces ǫ(ω, q)−2 by (1 + κ2Vaa(q)/4π)−1. This
result gives the classical ﬁeld dependent Debye- Onsager- relaxation- eﬀect
up to ﬁeld strengths x < 1. Introducing the classical result (4) into (2) the

No relaxation ﬁeld appears for particles with equal charge to mass ratios.
The link to the known Debye- Onsager relaxation eﬀect can be found if we
assume that we have a plasma consisting of heavy ion (a) with charge one
and oppositely charge light ions (b) and temperatures Ta = Tb = T . Then (5)
reduces to δEa
T κ) and F (x) from (4). Within the linear response
the dynamical result leads to the known Debye relaxation ﬁeld [11] while the
static result here underestimates the value about one half. The high ﬁeld result
F (x) is monotonously approaching zero for high ﬁelds and can be compared
with the known result from electrolyte theory, recently [14]. The result (5)
with (4) is an extension to the work of [5] in that it gives the relaxation ﬁeld
up to any ﬁeld strength, not restricting to linear response and an extension
to [15] that dynamical screening is included. The complete quantum case of
(3) can be given by performing the integral. The result gives a series in ﬁeld
strength x, which however does not converge for x = 1. In the following we
give only the ﬁrst two parts of the expansion with respect to the ﬁeld. The
quantum eﬀects are included completely. The quantum linear response reads

with b1 = b/2. This result reproduces [5] by a diﬀerent way of calculation.
All higher order terms can be given in analytical form as well. In the Fig.
1a we plot the quantum versus classical result for linear response and cubic
response versus the quantum parameter b. We see that the cubic response
is less inﬂuenced by quantum eﬀects than the linear response result. The
general observation is that the quantum eﬀects lower the classical result for
the relaxation eﬀect. A detailed analysis of quantum eﬀects on the linear
response can be found in [5,15].

In Fig. 1b we give the ratio of quantum to classical result for the relaxation
eﬀect up to cubic terms in ﬁelds for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths x. We see that the
quantum eﬀects become more important with increasing ﬁeld strength. The
eﬀect of sign change can be seen in the quantum eﬀects at certain values of b.
We remark that the electric ﬁeld is limited to values x < 1 or E < κT
e beyond
no quasi equilibrated transport is possible, i.e. no thermal distributions are
pertained in the system. Then we have to take into account nonthermal ﬁeld
dependent distributions which have been employed to study nonlinear con-
ductivity [16,13].

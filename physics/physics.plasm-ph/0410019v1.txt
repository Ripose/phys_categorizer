Abstract. Ultracold neutral plasmas are formed by photoionizing laser-cooled
atoms near the ionization threshold. Through the application of atomic physics
techniques and diagnostics, these experiments stretch the boundaries of traditional
neutral plasma physics. The electron temperature in these plasmas ranges from
1-1000 K and the ion temperature is around 1 K. The density can approach
1011 cm−3. Fundamental interest stems from the possibility of creating strongly-
coupled plasmas, but recombination, collective modes, and thermalization in
these systems have also been studied. Optical absorption images of a strontium
plasma, using the Sr+ 2S1/2 → 2P1/2 transition at 422 nm, depict the density
proﬁle of the plasma, and probe kinetics on a 50 ns time-scale. The Doppler-
broadened ion absorption spectrum measures the ion velocity distribution, which
gives an accurate measure of the ion dynamics in the ﬁrst microsecond after
photoionization.

1. Introduction

The study of ionized gases in neutral plasmas traditionally spans temperatures ranging
from 1016 K in the magnetosphere of a pulsar to 300 K in the earth’s ionosphere.
Ultracold neutral plasmas [1], formed by photoionizing laser-cooled atoms near the
ionization threshold, stretch the boundaries of these studies. The electron temperature
ranges from 1-1000K and the ion temperature is around 1 K. The density can approach
1011 cm−3.

Fundamental interest in these systems stems from a range of phenomena in the

average kinetic energy. This reverses the traditional energy hierarchy that underlies

such as dense astrophysical systems [3], matter irradiated with intense-laser ﬁelds
[4, 5], dusty plasmas of highly charged macroscopic particles [6], or non-neutral
trapped ion plasmas [7] that are laser-cooled until they freeze into a Wigner crystal.
Ultracold plasmas are excellent systems in which to study strong-coupling achieved at
relatively low-density in neutral systems where recombination, collective modes, and
thermalization are all interesting things to explore.

Early experiments with ultracold neutral plasmas used charged particle detection
techniques to study methods and conditions for forming the plasma[1], excitation and

the University of Virginia and Laboratoire Aim´e Cotton, Orsay, France studied the
spontaneous evolution of a dense, cold cloud of Rydberg atoms into a plasma [10].

plasma imaging. A review of the results from studies using charged particle diagnostics
can be found in [12].

Section 2 provides an overview of the creation of an ultracold neutral plasma
and the absorption imaging technique. Section 3 discusses the dynamics of the ions
during the ﬁrst few microseconds after photoionization. Section 4 describes the ion
absorption spectrum, and Sec. 5 describes recent studies of plasma equilibration.

2. Experimental Overview

The recipe for an ultracold neutral plasma starts with laser-cooled and trapped neutral
atoms[14]. Photons from properly arranged laser beams scatter oﬀ the atoms to
generate the forces for cooling and trapping. Alkali atoms, alkaline-earth atoms, and
metastable noble gas atoms are the most common atoms for these experiments because
they posses electric-dipole allowed transitions at convenient laser wavelengths. The
normal trapping conﬁguration is called a magneto-optical trap (MOT) (Fig. 1 and 2)
[13]. In the experiments described here, the neutral atom cloud is characterized by a
r2/2σ2),
temperature of a few mK and a density distribution given by n(r) = n0exp(
1010 cm−3. The number of trapped atoms is typically

To form the plasma, the MOT magnets are turned oﬀ and atoms are ionized with
photons from the cooling laser and from a 10 ns pulsed dye laser whose wavelength
is tuned just above the ionization continuum (Fig. 1). Up to 30% of the neutral

Because of the small electron-ion mass ratio, the electrons have an initial kinetic
energy approximately equal to the diﬀerence between the photon energy and the
ionization potential, typically between 1 and 1000 K. The initial kinetic energy for
the ions is close to the kinetic energy of neutral atoms in the MOT. As we will discuss
below, the resulting non-equilibrium plasma evolves rapidly.

To record an absorption image of the plasma, a collimated laser beam, tuned
near resonance with the principle transition in the ions, illuminates the plasma and
falls on an image intensiﬁed CCD camera. The ions scatter photons out of the laser
beam and create a shadow that is recorded by an intensiﬁed CCD camera. The optical
depth (OD) is deﬁned in terms of the image intensity without (Ibackground) and with

In order to understand the details of the image analysis, it is necessary to understand
the dynamics of the plasma. The imaging probe is most sensitive to the ion
dynamics, so we will concentrate on this topic. The behavior of electrons was studied
experimentally in [1, 8, 9] and theoretically in [15, 16, 17].

Ions are created with very little kinetic energy, but their initial spatially
uncorrelated state possesses signiﬁcant Coulomb potential energy compared to the
regular lattice that represents the ground state of the system [18, 7]. As ions equilibrate
and correlations develop, the kinetic energy increases. This process is called disorder-
induced heating, or correlation heating, and it has been discussed in many theoretical
papers. Early interest was generated by non-equilibrium plasmas created by fast-pulse
laser irradiation of solid targets, for example [19, 20, 21, 22], and the problem has been
revisited in the context of ultracold neutral plasmas [15, 16, 23, 24].

Qualitatively, one expects the ion temperature after equilibration to be on the
order of the Coulomb interaction energy between neighboring ions. A quantitative
analysis [23], assuming complete initial disorder and incorporating the screening eﬀects
of the electrons, predicts an ion temperature of

Physically, this is the time for an ion to move about an interparticle spacing when
accelerated by a typical Coulomb force of e2/4πε0a2. This time scale is also evident in
molecular dynamics simulations of ion-ion thermalization [15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].

means in [17]. The experiments measured the ﬁnal velocity that the ions acquired,
Ee/mi. With the imaging probe, we can now
observe the expansion dynamics at much earlier times during the acceleration phase.
As discussed in [8] and [11], a hydrodynamic model, which describes the plasma
on length scales larger than λD, shows that the pressure of the electron gas drives the
expansion through an average force per ion of

The velocity is correlated with position and increases linearly with time. This does
not represent an increase in the random thermal velocity spread or temperature of
the ions. Due to the large mass diﬀerence, thermalization of ions and electrons [15] is
slow and occurs on a millisecond time scale.

Equation 4 for the average ion velocity assumes a constant electron temperature.
Actually, as the plasma expands, electrons will cool. This can be thought of in terms
of energy conservation or adiabatic expansion. It is possible to describe the expansion
with a Vlasov equation that includes the changing electron temperature. For an
initial Gaussian density distribution, the equations can be solved analytically and
the expansion preserves the Gaussian shape with a 1/√e density radius given by

imaging of the plasma, however, have concentrated on the ﬁrst few microseconds
of the expansion when the plasma size and electron temperature have not changed
signiﬁcantly. Thus we can safely use Eq. 4. The eﬀects of the expansion are evident
in the radial velocity that manifests itself in Doppler broadening of the ion absorption
spectrum.

4. Doppler-Broadened Spectrum

To obtain quantitative information from the plasma images, we relate the OD (Eq.
1) to underlying physical parameters. Following Beer’s law, the OD for a laser
propagating along the z axis is

OD(x, y) =

dz ni(x, y, z)α[ν, Ti(r)],

Z

where ni(x, y, z) is the ion density, and α[ν, Ti(r)] is the ion absorption cross section at
the image beam frequency, ν. The absorption cross section is a function of temperature
due to Doppler broadening, and since we expect the temperature to vary with density,
we allow α to vary with position. If we now integrate over x and y, or, in reality, sum
over the image pixels multiplied by the pixel area, we get the spectrum

To quantitatively analyze the data in Figs. 5 we must account for the eﬀect of
the inhomogeneous density distribution [31]. We expect the ion temperature to vary
with density because global thermal equilibrium occurs on a hydrodynamic time scale,
σ/v, which is on the order of tens of µs, where v is the ion acoustic wave velocity.
Local thermal equilibration occurs on a much faster time scale,
[32]. For a
range of reasonable temperature distribution, numerical simulations [31] show that
Ti,ef f = (0.95
0.05)Ti,ave. Here Ti,ave is the average ion temperature in the plasma.
The extracted Ti,ave and Eq. 2 agree within our uncertainties of typically 0.2 K.

If the eﬀective ion temperature is measured for longer delay times, acceleration
of the ions by the electron pressure also becomes important. The eﬀect is small for
the data presented here, but its eﬀect can be modelled [30, 31]. The acceleration of
the ions then becomes a sensitive probe of the electron temperature which evolves
under the inﬂuence of recombination, continuum lowering, disorder-induced heating,
and adiabatic expansion [8, 11, 30, 17, 28].

Intuitively, one can explain this phenomenon as an oscillation of each ion in its
local potential energy well. A simple calculation implies that the time for an ion to
move an interparticle distance, when accelerated from rest by a force of e2/(4πε0a2),

varies as
pi , and the observed oscillation occurs at 2ωpi. As expected from the
density dependence of ωpi, the oscillation period is longer for the outer region where the
average density is lower. This explains why averaging over the entire cloud obscures
the oscillation; the motion dephases because of the variation in ωpi. It is questionable
whether the ion motion should be called an ion plasma oscillation or not, because
there is probably no collective, or long range coherence to the motion.

∼

Kinetic energy oscillations at 2ωpi have been observed in molecular dynamics
simulations of equilibrating strongly-coupled systems [20, 22, 24]. Calculations [33, 34]
also show oscillations in the velocity autocorrelation function in equilibrium strongly-
coupled one-component plasmas. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst experimental
observation of the phenomenon.

Numerical results[20] suggest that the damping time for the oscillations is
5, and that lower Γi leads to faster damping. Because
approximately π/ωpi for Γi ≥

are eﬀective ion temperatures at the peak and dip of the oscillation.

In conclusion, we have developed absorption imaging as a tool for studying
ultracold neutral plasmas [11]. The absorption spectrum, after accounting for the
inhomogeneous plasma density distribution, measures the average ion temperature.
Equilibration of the plasma shows the eﬀect of disorder-induced heating. The screening
eﬀect of electrons on the ﬁnal ion temperature has been studied, and experiment and
theory agree very well [30]. The ion kinetic energy also displays oscillations that are
characteristic of equilibrating strongly coupled plasmas.

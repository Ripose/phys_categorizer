Abstract

The problem of determining the eﬀective conductivity tensor of a magnetoactive turbu-
lent plasma is considered in the approximation of isolated particles. Additional gyrotrop-
icterms are shown to appear in the conductivity tensor in the presence of mean, nonzero
magnetic helicity. The dispersion of propagating electro- magnetic waves changes, addi-
tional modes and additional rotation of the polarization plane appear, and the waves can
be ampliﬁed. The properties acquired by plasma with helicity are similar those observed
in chiral and bianisotropic electrodynamic media.

1 INTRODUCTION

An eﬀective description of the propagation of waves and particles in ﬂuctuational magnetic
ﬁelds in a turbulent conductive medium is of great importance in solving the various problems
of plasma physics and astrophysics. The phenomena associated with the presence of small-
scale magnetic helicity hABi (B =rotA), which manifest themselves virtually on all scales of
plasma systems, play a special role here. Whereas large-scale helicity contributes to the stability
of electromagnetic structures [1], its presence at the level of ﬂuctuations is a nonequilibrium
phenomenon that is accompanied by various large-scale instabilities [2]. Other eﬀects produced
by small-scale helicity, such as an asymmetry in the particle distribution and acceleration, are
well known in the diﬀusion theory of cosmicray propagation [3–6]. The gyrotropic acceleration
eﬀects are also known in a laboratory plasma as helicity input eﬀects [7, 8]. The appearance
of additional helicity-related transport was also shown to be possible in [9]. Changes in the
transport properties are also directly reﬂected in the dielectric (conductive) properties of a
plasma medium. Thus, for example, it was shown in [10] that in the presence of ﬂuctuational
magnetic helicity in the low-conductivity limit, the eﬀective current in an isotropic plasma
proves to be dependent on the curl of the electric ﬁeld ( j = σE + σκrotE), which causes the
mean magnetic ﬁeld to grow under certain conditions. In [10], the external magnetic ﬁeld was
disregarded. In natural and laboratory conditions, the plasma is always under the inﬂuence of
large-scale magnetic ﬁelds that aﬀect signiﬁcantly its properties [11]. Since magnetic helicity
also emerges in plasma systems in the presence of a large-scale magnetic ﬁeld, a study of its
inﬂuence should take into account this factor. In [12], it was shown for an exactly solvable

model of nonlinear dynamo that the diﬀusion and generation rate are strongly suppressed
even in a relatively weak magnetic ﬁeld, and the regime of fast dynamo transforms into the
regime of slow dynamo with a linear growth with time. The goal of this work is to study the
eﬀective conductivity of a turbulent magnetoactive plasma with nonzero magnetic helicity. The
kinetic approach is commonly used for a thorough theoretical description of plasma problems.
However, an allowance for the ﬂuctuational eﬀects of gyrotropy is rather diﬃcult to make and
is possible in ﬁnished form only with an appreciable number of assumptions and simpliﬁcations
(see, e.g., [6, 9]). At the same time, many basic plasma properties can be determined in the
approximation of isolated particles [11, 13], which will be used below. The statistical parameters
of the electromagnetic ﬂuctuations are assumed to be stationary and uniform. In Section 2,
we consider the equations of motion for particles and calculate the eﬀective Lorentz force by
the functional method with an allowance made for the nonuniformity of the electromagnetic
perturbations to within the ﬁrst order of the perturbation theory. In Section 3, we determine
the eﬀective conductivity tensor. Fluctuational magnetic helicity gives rise to new gyrotropic
terms. Our analysis of the dispersion relation both in the approximation of δ–correlated (in
time) ﬂuctuations (Section 4) and in the opposite case of long correlation times and high
frequencies (Section 6) for electromagnetic waves and the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld (in
the low-frequency limit) (Section 5) reveals changes in the dispersion of propagating waves
and the presence of instabilities. The characteristic scales and growth rates of the instabilities
are determined by the relationship between the ﬂuctuational helicity and the energy and the
external magnetic ﬁeld. A magnetoactive turbulent plasma with helicity acquires properties
similar to those of chiral and bianisotropic electrodynamic media, which have been extensively
studied in recent years [14, 15]. In Conclusions, we discuss our results and implications of the
detected eﬀect.

2 BASIC EQUATIONS

Let us consider the motion of a one-component, singly charged plasma in a ﬂuctuational elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld with given correlation properties. We will consider a cold plasma where the
approximation of isolated particles [11, 13] can be used. A regular large-scale nonuniform per-
turbation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld that is too weak to change signiﬁcantly the correlation
properties of the electromagnetic ﬂuctuations, which are supposed to be given, stationary, and
uniform, is assumed to arise in the system. The expression for the electron velocity v can be
written as

where e and m are the electron charge and mass, respectively. The electromagnetic ﬁeld and
the velocity can be represented as a sum of the large-scale slow component and the small-scale
(with a zero mean) fast component:

The second variational derivative depends on the third derivative etc. In general, the problem
is not closed. In the case of δ-correlated (in time) ﬂuctuations, the ﬁrst term is retained in Eq.
(4), which corresponds to the Gaussian approximation. This is also a good approximation for
short correlation times.

To take into account long correlation times, we can use, in particular, a consistent proce-
dure of allowance for the memory eﬀects similar to that suggested in [17]. Having obtained

3

the equation for the n−th variational derivative, let us substitute the emerging term with
the(n + 1)−th derivative with an eﬀective relaxation term, which reﬂects the mixing role of the
higher-order moments. This, in turn, gives rise to an eﬀective collision frequency determined
by the pulsation amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld in the equation for the (n − 1)−th variational
derivative, so the frequency s in an operator of the type ˆLjs (s) changes to s′ s + iw∗. Here,
we restrict our analysis to a simpler approach and set the last term in Eq. ((5), as for a δ-
correlated (in time) process, equal to zero. We can verify by direct analysis that this is possible
when the characteristic frequencies of the electromagnetic ﬂuctuations are much higher than
the stochastic Larmor frequency determined from the mean amplitude of the magnetic ﬂuctu-

Here, l is a unit vector parallel to the uniform magnetic ﬁeld, l ⇈ B0. All of the correlation
functions, except for C(q, (lq) , s), are even in (lq). The symmetry properties also admit the
combinations linear in components of the vector l considered in [6, 9]. However, it was shown
in [18, 20] that when the anisotropy is attributable to a magnetic ﬁeld, the only possible
combinations are quadratic ones1. This is also conﬁrmed by direct calculations of the magnetic
ﬁeld eﬀect on the correlation properties of turbulence [21]. For a weak anisotropy (and for
obtaining analytical results), we can use the representation

EM (q, (lq), s) = E(q, s) −

Here, τ∗ is the time constant determined by the characteristic frequencies and scales. Thus,

for example, for interplanetary plasma turbulence [22], τ∗ is assumed to be τ∗ ∼ λ

vA
where λ is the characteristic ﬂuctuational scale of the magnetic nonuniformities. Clearly, this
Qmk(k − q, w − s) =
estimate is also valid for ionospheric plasma. Let us expand the tensor

The subscript 0 corresponds to the isotropic case. As we see, the eﬀective transport coeﬃcients
are directly related to the mean energy and helicity of the ﬂuctuational magnetic ﬁeld. For the

The last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (24) has the meaning of constant acceleration

It was suggested, as an explanation, that the acceleration

relationship between the acceleration eﬀect and the transfer of electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum
to particles of the medium was drawn in [23]. Assuming that hEi, hBi = 0 are equal to

As we see from (32), ﬂuctuational helicity gives rise to additional gyrotropic terms in the permit-
tivity tensor. To elucidate their role, let us analyze the dispersion relation for electromagnetic
waves.

refractive index n = ck/w is deﬁned as [11]

As we see, in the presence of magnetic ﬂuctuation helicity, there is an instability and the am-
plitude of the electromagnetic waves propagating in a plasma increases. This demonstrates the
nonequilibrium existence of reﬂectional symmetry breaking at the level of ﬂuctuations. Thus,
for example, helicity also leads to an instability, an inverse energy cascade, in magnetohydrody-
namics [2]. Unstable waves have nonzero helicity, i.e., a vortex component of the electric ﬁeld.
The motion of charged particles in a magnetic ﬁeld with ﬂuctuational helicity is equivalent to
the motion in random helical magnetic ﬁelds with preferred helix orientation.

The resonance condition during the motion of particles in a helical magnetic ﬁeld is satisﬁed
for the particles that move in a direction opposite to the ﬁeld (Bv < 0) [25]. After averaging,
this resonance condition will correspond to the following: when the helicities of the perturba-
tions and ﬂuctuations have opposite signs, the perturbations will give up energy to particles
of the medium; in contrast, when the helicities of the perturbations and ﬂuctuations have
the same signs, the ﬁeld will be ampliﬁed — take away energy from particles of the medium.
Indeed, the helicity of growing waves coincides in sign with the small-scale ﬂuctuational he-
licity. In the opposite case, the perturbation is damped. Note also that the dispersion of the
propagating waves changes as well. For large scales, w ∼ k1/2, the dispersion law is similar
to that of gravity waves in deep water whose phase velocity increases with scale. Such long
waves can be revealed in the spectrum of geoelectromagnetic perturbations. Note that the
fast large–scale electric perturbations in the E region of the ionosphere that accompany such
catastrophic events as magnetic storms and substorms, earthquakes, and man-made explosions
are, to all appearances, of a vortex nature [26]. Let us consider the range of helicon frequencies:
Ωi ≪ w ≪ Ωe, ω2

e ≫ wΩe. In this case, the frequency can be expressed as

w = ±Ωe

∓ iα⊥ekλκ⊥Ωe

(44)

The wave propagation is also accompanied by an instability with the growth rate α⊥ekλκ⊥Ωe.

Retaining the quadratic terms in the expansion of the Lorentz force

v(q, s)×

B(k − q, w − s)

(cid:29)
in terms of large scales (k ≪ q) yields a lower limit for such instability [10], and the perturba-
tions are damped at k > kcrit. Let us consider the waves that propagate perpendicular to the

In the absence of helicity, the ﬁrst and second expressions in (45) would correspond to the
extraordinary and ordinary waves, respectively. As we see, their propagation conditions change,
and elliptical polarization attributable to helicity appears in both types of waves.

5 THE OHM LAW FOR LOW FREQUENCIES

Let us consider the case of low frequencies where w ≪ Ω2
the collision frequency ν = 1/τc ≫ w (1/τ ′
assume a weak anisotropy of Ω2

⊥e(i)τ∗) and take into account
c for ions). To simplify our calculations, we also

with the Ohm law (48). We will disregard the ion component (the EMHD approximation).
Neglecting the displacement current, we obtain the following expression for the growth rate γ

region, and the ﬁeld perturbations are damped on small scales.

It is easy to see that an additional rotation of the polarization plane appears here.

As in the approximation of a δ-correlated random process (45) considered above, the propa-
gation conditions change, and elliptical polarization attributable to helicity appears in both the
ordinary and extraordinary waves. Note that in the case of inﬁnite correlation times or high
frequencies (frozen ﬂuctuations), the properties of a plasma medium with magnetic helicity are
similar to those of chiral and bianisotropic media [14, 15]. In real systems, wτ is ﬁnite, and the
eﬀects of both instability considered in Section 4 and the appearance of additional wave modes
must simultaneously manifest themselves.

7 CONCLUSIONS

The inﬂuence of magnetic ﬂuctuations on the motion of the particles of a cold magnetoactive
plasma primarily reduces to the appearance of an eﬀective ﬂuctuational collision frequency
determined by the statistical parameters and to the decrease in conductivity. Reﬂectional

13

symmetry breaking—nonzero mean magnetic helicity of the ﬂuctuations—leads to a change in
the dispersion of the propagating waves and the appearance of additional modes. The waves
can be unstable, reﬂecting both the nonequilibrium nature of the turbulent magnetic helicity
and the peculiarities of the particle motion in random helical magnetic ﬁelds. The instability
growth rate is proportional to the helicity of the ﬂuctuational magnetic ﬁeld and the amplitude
of the large scale uniform magnetic ﬁeld. An allowance for the ﬁnite correlation times and for
the additional ﬂuctuational quadratic dispersion eﬀects restricts the action of this instability.
In contrast to the turbulent dynamo eﬀects considered in the MHD and EMHD approximations
[2], here there is a natural restriction of the instability region on large scales determined by
the relationship between the ﬂuctuational helicity and energy and the large-scale magnetic
ﬁeld. The plasma acquires properties similar to those observed in chiral and bianisotropic
media [14, 15]. Consequently, it can have properties characteristic of these media, such as
In contrast
anomalous absorption [27, 28] and additional wave conversion eﬀects [29, 30].
to the artiﬁcial external origin of the chirality in chiral media, this property is natural in a
turbulent magnetoactive plasma with helicity. The deviations in the rotation of the polarization
plane attributable to ﬂuctuational helicity can serve as a tool for diagnosing it. The results
were obtained in the approximation of isolated particles whose advantages and disadvantages
are well known. It is easy to see that the above eﬀects are preserved when the thermal and
collisional eﬀects are taken into account and can be obtained in terms of the kinetic approach.

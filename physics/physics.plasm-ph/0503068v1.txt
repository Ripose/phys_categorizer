Conﬁgurations with nearby multiple resonant surfaces have broad spectra of linearly unstable
tearing modes with dominant high poloidal mode numbers m. This was recently shown for the case
of multiple q = 1 resonances [Bierwage et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (6), 65001 (2005)]. In the present
work, similar behavior is found for double tearing modes (DTM) on resonant surfaces with q ≥ 1.
A detailed analysis of linear instability characteristics of DTMs with various mode numbers m is
performed using numerical simulations. The mode structures and dispersion relations for linearly
unstable modes are calculated. Comparisons between low- and higher-m modes are carried out, and
the roles of the inter-resonance distance and of the magnetic Reynolds number SHp are investigated.
High-m modes are found to be destabilized when the distance between the resonant surfaces is small.
They dominate over low-m modes in a wide range of SHp, including regimes relevant for tokamak
operation. These results may be readily applied to conﬁgurations with more than two resonant
surfaces.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Double tearing modes (DTM) are considered to be cou-
pled tearing modes on adjacent resonant surfaces which
eﬀectively “drive each other” [1, 2, 3], so that the result-
ing instability is stronger than the single-tearing-mode
(STM) case and modes with higher poloidal mode num-
bers m become dominant [4].

DTMs are considered to be involved in a variety of dy-
namical processes in tokamak plasmas. In the current-
ramp-up phase of the tokamak operation they were used
to explain the anomalously strong current penetration
[5, 6, 7] and short-wavelength MHD activity (e.g., Mirnov
oscillations) [6, 8]. Experimental observations of par-
tial and compound sawtooth crashes (internal disrup-
tions) [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] may be explained through
kink-tearing modes on double/multiple resonant surfaces
[14, 15, 16, 17]. Phenomena associated with low-beta
disruptions in the presence of double resonant surfaces
with qres > 1 may also be understood in terms of DTM
activity [14, 18, 19].
In some way related to DTMs is
the coupling between modes on resonant surfaces with
diﬀerent qres, which may explain some salient features of
major disruptions [7, 20, 21]. A more recent application
is related to the formation of internal transport barriers
(ITB) in advanced tokamaks. DTMs were suggested to
be involved in this process due to the fact that ITBs are
often observed in the vicinity of resonant surfaces or near
qmin [22, 23].

It was found that DTMs with any mode number m
become similar to m = 1 internal kink modes [24] when
the distance between the resonant surfaces is suﬃciently

small [6]. This is reﬂected by the linear growth rate
γlin scaling with the magnetic Reynolds number SHp as
[2]. When the distance between the resonant
γlin ∝
surfaces is large, the structure of the instability resem-
bles that of individual STMs localized on each resonant
S−3/5
surface.
In this case, the scaling law is γlin ∝
Hp
[25]. Furthermore, it was found that the coupling in a
DTM may also destabilize linearly stable tearing modes
[18] and speed up the growth of magnetic islands in the
nonlinear regime [1, 19, 26, 27]. The instability of DTMs
may be enhanced by eﬀects like anomalous electron vis-
cosity [6, 28], ﬁnite beta and sheared toroidal ﬂows [29].
Poloidal shear ﬂows, on the other hand, may have a stabi-
lizing eﬀect [30, 31], raising the possibility of a dynamical
interplay between shear ﬂows and DTMs [32]. This idea
is supported by recent studies which indicate that MHD
activity associated with multiple resonant surfaces may
produce a signiﬁcant amount of sheared poloidal ﬂows
[28, 29].

Until now, studies related to DTMs in cylindrical (or
toroidal) plasmas were focussing mainly on the role of
the modes with the lowest poloidal and toroidal mode
numbers, m and n. High-m tearing modes were associ-
ated only with correspondingly high values of qres = m/n
[1, 6, 8, 33]. Recently it was demonstrated for the case of
qres = 1 double and triple tearing modes that modes with
high m may dominate over low-m modes in a cylindrical
plasma even on low-q resonant surfaces [4]. There it was
found that in conﬁgurations where the distance between
neighboring resonant surfaces is suﬃciently small, broad
spectra of unstable modes exist and that the dominant
modes can have m

(10).

Motivated by the results of Ref. [4], in the present work
we investigate the conditions under which broad spectra
of multiple tearing modes with dominant higher-m modes
may arise. For this purpose numerical simulations based
on the reduced resistive magnetohydrodynamic model in
cylindrical geometry are used. The dependence of the lin-

∼ O

ear growth rate on parameters such as the inter-resonance
distance, the dissipation coeﬃcients as well as the mag-
netic shear will be adressed.

The main results of the present work are the follow-
ing. It is shown that broad spectra of unstable DTMs
are also found in conﬁgurations with qres > 1, thus gen-
eralizing the results of Ref. [4]. The instability of modes
with m > 1 depends strongly on the distance between ad-
jacent resonant surfaces. For the resistivity dependence,

a scaling law γlin ∝

in agreement with former studies [2, 27]. For interme-
diate values of SHp no power law is identiﬁed and for
SHp independently of m.

For high m and small D12 the range where the relation

especially in this regime where high-m modes are found
to be dominant. This regime may include ranges of SHp
that are relevant to tokamak operation. Let us note that
the results of the present paper may be applied to con-
ﬁgurations with more than two resonant surfaces.

The present paper is organized as follows. Section II
contains an introduction of the model equations and the
numerical method used. Numerical results are presented
in Section III, followed by a discussion and conclusions
in Section IV.

II. MODEL

A. Reduced MHD equations

The reduced set of magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD)
equations in cylindrical geometry [34] is used. It is ob-
tained from the full MHD model through a high-aspect
1 (e.g.,
ratio and low-β expansion: ǫ = a/R0 ≪
[35]). Here, a and R0 are, respectively, the minor and
major radius of the torus, ǫ is the inverse aspect ratio,
and the plasma beta β = p/(B2
0/2µ0), is the ratio of
thermodynamic pressure to magnetic pressure.

The high-aspect-ratio ordering and the presence of a
strong axial magnetic ﬁeld B0 allows to express the mag-
netic ﬁeld in terms of a magnetic ﬂux function Ψ as
B = B0ˆz +
ˆz. Here, ˆz is the unit vector in the axial
direction and B0 is taken to be constant. In the MHD
ordering, the single-ﬂuid velocity V is approximated by
the E
ˆz/B0, where Φ
is the electrostatic potential (or stream function). In the
limit of zero β the pressure equation is decoupled and the
RMHD equations take the form of a two-ﬁeld model:

Normalizing the time by the poloidal Alfv´en time
τHp = √µ0ρma/Bϑ(a), the radial coordinate by a,
and introducing the angular coordinate ζ

the normalized variables are ψ = Ψ/aBϑ(a) and φ =
Φ/(a2/τHp). Note that ζ is related to the toroidal angle
ϕ via ζ =
ϕ/q(a), with q(a) = aB0/R0Bϑ(a) being the
safety factor at r = a [c.f., Eq. (5)]. The normalization
for the source term is Eζ = Ez/(η0Bϑ(a)/µ0a). With
these normalizations the Eqs. (1) and (2) become

respectively. The magnetic Reynolds number SHp (also
called Lundquist number) and the kinematic Reynolds
number ReHp are deﬁned as SHp ≡
τη/τHp and ReHp =
a2/(νmτHp/ρm), respectively. Here, τη = a2µ0/η(r = 0)
is the resistive diﬀusion time. The resistivity proﬁle
is given by ˆη(r), normalized such that ˆη(r = 0) = 1.
The relative strengths of kinetic viscosity and (resis-
tive) diﬀusion are characterized by the Prandtl number
ν/η, with ν = νm/ρm being the spe-
P r = SHp/ReHp ∝
ciﬁc ion viscosity.

B. RMHD equilibrium and resonant modes

The equilibrium state is deﬁned as ∂tψ = ∂tφ = 0.
Since the eﬀect of the plasma pressure is neglected, the
structure of the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld Beq is given
in terms of the tokamak safety factor q, deﬁned as

.

(5)

q =

ϑ
The safety factor measures the ﬁeld line pitch by counting
how many times a magnetic ﬁeld line goes the long way
around the torus (2πR0) after one turn the short way
around (2πr). Here, q = q(r), so that the equilibrium
magnetic ﬂux surfaces, where ψ = const., are uniquely
deﬁned by the radius r. Each ﬁeld variable f is written
in terms of a time-independent equilibrium component f
and a time-dependent perturbation

f as

f (r, ϑ, ζ, t) = f (r) +

f (r, ϑ, ζ, t).

In general, a tokamak plasma has magnetic surfaces
where qres = q(rs) = m/n, with integers m and n. These
are called rational or resonant surfaces. The radius rs is
called resonant radius, because an inﬁnitesimally small
helical magnetic perturbation with helicity h = m/n is
resonant with the magnetic ﬁeld structure in the vicin-
ψm,n does not

bend ﬁeld lines, so there is no restoring force. If the per-
turbation leads the system to a state of lower energy, the
amplitude of the resonant perturbation will grow and the
mode is said to be unstable.

C. Fourier representation

In order to study the properties of such resonant modes
it is useful to apply a Fourier transform with respect to
the periodic coordinates: (ϑ, ζ)
(m, n). This repre-
sentation also gives an eﬃcient and accurate numerical
model. Substituting for each ﬁeld variable f in Eqs. (3)
and (4) the Fourier expansion

model, if a perturbation is applied only to modes of a
given helicity h = m/n, modes with diﬀerent helicities
will not be excited and the problem is eﬀectively reduced
to a two-dimensional one. In the following, we will ex-
clusively refer to individual Fourier components of the
ﬁeld variables and usually omit the (m, n) subscripts for
convenience. Note that the equilibrium ﬁelds f = f (r)
have only (m, n) = (0, 0) components.

D. Equilibrium model

In order to study conﬁgurations with two resonant sur-
faces, the following model formula for the equilibrium q
proﬁle is used:

proﬁle ˆη is neglected one often assumes ˆη(r) = j(r =
0)/j(r). This will generally lead to diﬀerent values of
the resistivity at diﬀerent rsi. In order to simplify the
comparison between growth rates of modes associated
with diﬀerent resonant surfaces, a homogeneous resistiv-
ity proﬁle, ˆη(r) = 1, is used in this study. Numerical
tests indicate that the details of ˆη have no signiﬁcant ef-
fect on any of the qualitative characteristics discussed in
this paper.

E. Linearized equations

When the amplitudes and gradients of the perturbed
ﬁelds are suﬃciently small the nonlinear terms in Eqs. (9)
and (10) may be neglected and one obtains the linearized
RMHD equations. In the linear system, the time depen-
dence of a perturbed ﬁeld variable

n = m/qres). Along with the radial structure of the

racy of the results is checked by running tests with dif-
ferent numbers of radial grid points (up to 1024) and
through comparison with results obtained by solving
the linearized version of Eqs. (1) and (2) as an initial
value problem. The relative error was estimated to be
. 10%, with the largest errors occurring at high values
of SHp & 109. Due to numerical constraints, the regime
SHp > 1010 was not accessible with suﬃcient accuracy.

A. Mode structures

The radial structure of an eigenmode determines which
part of the plasma is aﬀected by the instability, since φ(r)
is related to the radial and poloidal components of the

FIG. 3: Mode structures of the unstable qres = 2 DTM eigen-
modes with (m, n) = (2, 1).
In (a) and (c), respectively, ψ
and φ/r are shown for Case (IIIa) (D12 = 0.31). In (b) and
(d) the results for Case (IIIb) (D12 = 0.06) are plotted.

The radial mode structures of unstable qres = 1 DTMs
are shown in Fig. 2. The conﬁguration used is Case (Ia),
where D12 = 0.06. For m = 1 [Fig. 2(a) and (c)] there
are two unstable eigenmodes. For m > 1 [Fig. 2(b) and
(d)] only one eigenmode is unstable (the m = 8 mode
structure shown is representative for other modes with
m > 1). In our notation, the eigenmode M (1) is associ-
ated with the innermost resonant surface rs1. For m = 1
it has a ﬁnite amplitude in the region 0 < r < rs1. The

FIG. 4: Dependence of the linear DTM growth rates on the
Prandtl number [Case (Ia)]. The growth rates of eigenmodes
with m = 1, 2, 8 are plotted for ﬁxed SHp = 106.

eigenmode M (2) is active in the region 0 < r < rs2 for
m = 1, and mainly in the region rs1 < 0 < rs2 for m > 1.
In Figure 3, the mode structures of qres = 2 DTMs
with (m, n) = (2, 1) are plotted. Results are shown for
two cases with diﬀerent distances D12: Case (IIIa) with
D12 = 0.31 [Fig. 3(a) and (c)], and Case (IIIb) with
D12 = 0.06 [Fig. 3(b) and (d)]. In agreement with pre-
vious works on DTMs, it is found that two individual
modes are present in the case of larger D12: M (1) around
rs1 and M (2) around rs2. In the case of smaller D12 only
the eigenmode M (2) is found to be unstable.

The M (1) eigenmode is essentially an STM associated
with the r = rs1 resonant surface (here, a negative-shear
surface), since it is practically unaﬀected by the presence
of resonant surfaces beyond r = rs1. The actual DTMs
(for suﬃciently small D12) are the M (2) eigenmodes. The
radial structure of DTMs with m > 1 is very similar for
diﬀerent qres, as may be seen by comparing the proﬁles
(b) and (d) in Figs. 2 and 3. Let us note that Cases (II),
(IV) and (V) of Table II, where qres = 3/2, 5/2 and 3,
respectively, have eigenmode structures very similar to
those found for qres = 2 in Fig. 3.

The local resistivity η(rsi) and the magnetic shear
s(rsi) at a resonant surface rsi, together with the dis-
tance between neighboring resonant surfaces D12, deter-
mine which eigenmode, M (1) or M (2), will be the domi-
nant mode for a given m. An exception is the STM-like
eigenmode M (1): as its mode structure indicates, it is
not aﬀected by D12.

B. Viscosity eﬀect

Although, it is diﬃcult to obtain reliable values for the
ion viscosity in the tokamak core, it is usually thought
to be very low. However, it is required in most nonlin-
ear simulations for the purpose of providing a cut-oﬀ at

FIG. 5: Comparison between dispersion relations for (a)
qres = 1, 2 and 3, and (b) qres = 3/2 and 5/2. For all
cases D12 = 0.06 (cf., Table II). For m = 1, circles in di-
agram (a), growth rates of both unstable modes are shown:

short wavelengths in order to be consistent with the ﬁ-
nite number of grid points or Fourier modes. As may be
seen from Fig. 4, as long as the Prandtl number satisﬁes
P r . 0.1, the viscosity has practically no eﬀect on the
linear growth rates of DTMs. A similar result is also ob-
tained for other values of SHp as well as for single and
triple tearing modes, so it may be considered a generic
characteristic of tearing modes. The mode structures in
Figs. 2 and 3 and all the following results were obtained
in the regime where P r < 0.01, so the viscosity eﬀect
will not be discussed further in this paper. Let us note
that the stabilizing eﬀect of viscosity for P r & 1, evident
in Fig. 4, was pointed out previously by Ofman [30] in
a study on DTMs in the presence of equilibrium shear
ﬂows.

C. Dispersion relations for qres ≥ 1

Recently it was discovered that conﬁgurations with
nearby q = 1 resonant surfaces have broad spectra of
linearly unstable modes [4]. In particular, if the distance
between the resonant radii is suﬃciently small, modes
with m
(10) were found to have linear growth rates
several times higher than the m = 1 mode.

∼ O

Indeed, similar behavior is observed when the reso-
nances are located at higher q values, such as qres = 3/2,
2, 5/2 and 3, corresponding to Cases (IIb), (III), (IV)
and (V), respectively. The dispersion relations for these
cases are shown in Fig. 5. All these q proﬁles have the
same values for D12, s1 and s2. They only diﬀer from
each other in the values of qmin and qres. Let us remark
that for all cases the width of the spectrum as well as
the location of the maximum growth rate is practically

FIG. 6: Role of D12 (variable shears) for the instability of
qres = 1 DTMs. In (a) the q proﬁles are shown [Cases (Ia,b,c)
in Table II] and in (b) the corresponding dispersion relations

(21)

is located at m = 8. Except for the m = 1 mode [qres =
1, Case (Ia)], all growth rates in Fig. 5 are associated
with M (2)-type eigenmodes. Due to these results it may
be conjectured that all DTMs [except for M (2)(m = 1)]
behave similarly for any qres, including qres = 1.

D. Role of D12

Consider the scenario where qmin gradually drops be-
low qres = 1 due to an increase in the current density.
During this process the distance between the resonant
surfaces will grow in time, starting from D12 = 0 when
qmin = qres. The series of Cases (Ia), (Ib) and (Ic), shown
in Fig. 6 (a), represent the equilibria at successive in-
stants in time during such a process. Similar cases were
previously investigated in Ref. [27] where the eﬀect of
D12 on γlin(m = 3, n = 1) and the corresponding scaling
S−α
Hp ) was characterized. In Ref. [36],
exponent α (γlin ∝
the role of qmin was studied in the context of partial and
full reconnection.

The dispersion relations for the three cases of Fig. 6(a)
are plotted in Fig. 6(b). Clearly, the width of the spec-
trum is reduced as D12 increases, and the m = 1 mode
eventually becomes dominant.

Note that Cases (Ia)–(Ic) all have diﬀerent magnetic
shears s1 and s2 [cf., Table II]. The eﬀect of varying
only D12 is illustrated in Fig. 7. Starting with Case (Ib),
where D12 = 0.21, the q proﬁle is gradually modiﬁed in
such a way that D12 decreases down to 0.08, while both
shears, s1 and s2, are held constant. The proﬁles used
are plotted in Fig. 7(a) and the corresponding dispersion

D12, but holding the shears s1 = −0.20 and s2 = 0.45 con-
stant. For this, the model equation (11) was multiplied by an-

appear when D12 is decreased.

It is known that a tearing mode is stable when the

The dependence of the DTM growth rates on the pa-
rameter qmin (meaning, simultaneous variation of D12,
s1 and s2) was studied previously by Ishii et al. [27] for
the (m, n) = (3, 1) mode and a set of q proﬁles similar to
those in Fig. 6(a). They found that the curve γlin(qmin) is
not monotonic. In Fig. 8(a) it is shown that this is also
true for the dependence of γlin on D12 alone (constant
shears):

a maximum around D12 = 0.14. A comparison between
the results for SHp = 106 in Fig. 8(a) and SHp = 107
in Fig. 8(b) shows that the value SHp inﬂuences the lo-
cation of the peak. This is most likely related to the
distance D12 becoming comparable to the linear resistive
layer width δη, which is estimated after Ref. [2],

E. Role of resistivity

In the previous sections the linear instability of DTMs
was investigated at SHp = 106, since this value lies in the

regime where nonlinear simulations of MHD instabilities
are often performed: 104 . SHp . 107. While large toka-
maks typically operate in regimes where SHp & 108 (ex-
cept in the early current-ramp-up phase), it is diﬃcult to
access this low-collisional regime with nonlinear simula-
tions. Therefore, the linear study of the SHp dependence
of DTM growth rates is an important tool for relating
nonlinear simulation results to plasma conditions.

In Fig. 9 the dispersion relations of Case (Ia) is shown
for SHp = 106, 107 and 108. The growth rates of all
modes are found to decrease with increasing SHp, as it is
expected for resistive instabilities. Let us remark that the
width of the spectrum is not aﬀected by the variation of
SHp: unstable modes are found in the range 1
18.
However, it can be seen that the growth rates of modes
with higher m drop more rapidly than growth rates of
low-m modes, when SHp is increased, which is also re-
ﬂected by the shift of the peak γpeak to lower m. This
is important, because the mode number of the fastest-
growing mode determines the size of the magnetic islands
formed in the early nonlinear regime [4].

In the remaining part of this section, the SHp depen-
dence of DTM growth rates is examined in detail. Com-
parisons between low- and higher-m modes are made and
the role of the distance D12 will also be emphasized.
First, cases where qres = 1 are considered, whereby a dis-
tinction is made between DTMs with m = 1 and m > 1.
The results obtained for qres = 1 are readily applied to
cases with qres > 1, as will be shown at the end of this
section where qres = 2 DTMs are considered.

DTMs with m = 1

It is known that DTMs with m = 1 behave similarly to
m = 1 STMs, regardless of the location of the resonant
surfaces and their mutual distance [6]. Due to this close
relationship between the m = 1 STMs and the m = 1
DTMs it is possible to decompose the non-monotonic q
proﬁle into two monotonic ones — one with a resonance
at rs1 and negative shear s1, the other with a resonance at
rs2 and positive shear s2 — and compare the growth rates
and SHp dependences of the STM eigenmodes with the
corresponding DTMs. Our aim is to characterize devia-
tions between STMs and DTMs in certain ranges of SHp.
For clarity, both M (1)- and M (2)-type eigenmodes in a
double-tearing conﬁguration are referred to as “DTMs.”
In Fig. 10 this comparison is performed for Case (Ia),
where D12 = 0.06 [Fig. 1 (a)]. The results for Cases (Ib)
and (Ic), where D12 = 0.21 and D13 = 0.31, respectively,
are presented in Fig. 11.

In Case (Ia),

can be observed that the DTM growth rates coincide with
the corresponding STM growth rates only at relatively
high values of SHp: γ(1)

the instability of the DTM eigenmode M (1) is compared with
the STM mode on the resonant surface (rs1, s1) (monotonic
proﬁle with negative shear), while M (2) is compared with the

1/3. Note the similarity between Fig. 14 and the qres = 1

FIG. 14: SHp dependence of the linear growth rates of qres = 2
DTMs. In diagram (a) the growth rates of the two m = 2

was observed to shift to lower m when SHp is increased
(Fig. 9). This is related to the fact that modes with dif-
S−α
ferent mode numbers m approach scaling laws γlin ∝
Hp
with diﬀerent exponents α = αm. Moreover, and in
agreement with earlier works [2, 27], it was found that the
scaling exponent αm is a function of the inter-resonance
distance D12 (e.g., Figs. 12 and 13).

Linear tearing mode theory predicts two characteristic
values for the SHp-scaling exponent: α = 1/3 for m = 1
modes [24] and DTMs on nearby resonant surfaces [2],
and α = 3/5 for STMs [25]. When the distance D12
is increased, DTMs are transformed into STMs and αm
gradually increases from 1/3 to 3/5 (except for m = 1
modes) [27]. In the present work, it was observed that
the transition from αm = 1/3 to 3/5 also occurs when m
is increased (Figs. 12, 13 and 14). However, the variation
of m does not change the character of the DTM mode
structures, which is in contrast with the above-mentioned
eﬀect of increasing D12 (Figs. 2 and 3).

For practical reasons, the knowledge of the mode num-
ber of the dominant mode mpeak in the spectrum γlin(m)
is important, since it determines the structure of the mag-
netic islands in the early nonlinear regime [4]. The obser-
vations that mpeak varies with SHp and that the growth

10

rates γlin(m) may approach their respective characteristic
scaling exponent αm only at very high values of SHp [c.f.,
Figs. 12, 13 and 14(b)] have the following important con-
sequence. Results obtained from nonlinear simulations
106) for a given
run in the collisional regime (e.g., SHp ∼
conﬁguration may not be easily extrapolated to higher-
SHp, since magnetic islands with diﬀerent poloidal mode
numbers are expected for diﬀerent SHp. Note, however,
that the eﬀective magnetic Reynolds number in the re-
connection regions may be smaller due to the action of
micro-turbulence (anomalous resistivity) [37, 38].

In summary, the linear instability characteristics of
DTMs with high poloidal mode numbers m were stud-
ied numerically. High-m tearing modes become unstable
when two or more resonant surfaces q(rs1) = q(rs2) = qres
are formed in a tokamak plasma and when the distance
between these resonances D12 =
is still small.
It was shown that despite the low magnetic shear in the
vicinity of qmin, modes with high m have high growth
rates due to the destabilizing eﬀect of small D12. The
width of the DTM spectrum and mode number of the
dominant mode were found to be independent of the q-
value. Broad spectra of unstable DTMs, with dominant
modes having m > 1, were found in a wide range of mag-
netic Reynolds numbers, including the regimes in which
tokamaks operate.

The ﬁndings of this linear study motivate a nonlinear
investigation of DTMs. Although, nonlinear simulations
were performed in the past (e.g., [14, 17, 27, 36]), new
results are to be expected when the broad spectra of un-
stable DTMs are taken into account [4]. This might have
important implications for the understanding of the saw-
tooth crash [39, 40, 41] and other applications of DTM
dynamics mentioned in the introduction, such as the
anomalous current penetration during the current-ramp
up phase, oﬀ-axis sawteeth or the formation of ITBs.

Abstract.

Real time control of many plasma parameters will be an essential aspect in the
development of reliable high performance operation of Next Step Tokamaks. The
main prerequisites for any feedback scheme are the precise real-time determination of
the quantities to be controlled, requiring top quality and highly reliable diagnostics,
and the availability of robust control algorithms.

A new set of real time diagnostics was recently implemented on JET to prove the
feasibility of determining, with high accuracy and time resolution, the most important
plasma quantities. With regard to feedback algorithms, new model-based controllers
were developed to allow a more robust control of several plasma parameters. Both
diagnostics and algorithms were successfully used in several experiments, ranging from
H-mode plasmas to conﬁguration with ITBs.

Since elaboration of computationally heavy measurements is often required,
signiﬁcant attention was devoted to non-algorithmic methods like Digital or Cellular
Neural/Nonlinear Networks.

The real time hardware and software adopted architectures are also described with

particular attention to their relevance to ITER.

1. Introduction

In the last years, the fusion community has witnessed a signiﬁcant proliferation in the
number of real time control experiments. This is due to a variety of reasons, among
which the most important are the increased sophistication of the scenarios and the
advanced physical issues attacked [1]. With regard to the scenarios, the Elmy H mode,
in the continuous attempts to increase the performances moving closer to the Greenwald
limit, requires high elongations and triangularity, with the related diﬃculties in terms
of stability of the plasma column. The so-called advanced scenarios, in their turn, rely
every day more on involved proﬁles of both pressure and current, posing not negligible
challenges to the control systems. The need to understand many unresolved issues, like
the physics of ELMs or the formation and sustainment of ITBs, also contributes to the

advanced real time control is particularly felt due to the extremely wide scope of its
research program and to the more acute safety implications of a big device [2]. As a
consequence a broad range of diﬀerent feedback schemes has been recently developed
covering a wide range of tasks from simple event driven actions to multivariable,
distributed control of proﬁles.

In Nuclear Fusion, as in any other ﬁeld, the ﬁrst step for a successful feedback is
the proper identiﬁcation of the system to be controlled. This means that the relevant
parameters of the system must be measured with adequate accuracy, reliability and

mainly on plasma diagnostics. In the last years, the main drive behind the success of
JET feedback control experiments were the major improvements in the number and
reliability of the measurements [3]. The signals available in real time at JET now
cover all relevant parameters, ranging from the magnetic conﬁguration to the kinetic
quantities. In addition to the traditional plasma shape obtained form the pick-up coils
and the ﬂux loops, the q proﬁle is derived from the Faraday rotation measurements
[4]. Both the electron and the ion ﬂuid are diagnosed. The electron density proﬁle
is provided by the LIDAR [3] and the interferometer, whereas the ECE [5] guarantees
an electron temperature proﬁle with much higher time resolution than the Thomson
Scattering. Active Charge exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS) is of course
the main system to derive real time information, temperature and velocity proﬁles, of
the ion ﬂuid [6].

A series of validated codes are also routinely used to obtain derived quantities. The
internal plasma inductance li and the derived conﬁnement parameters are calculated
from the Shafranov integrals [7]. A new shape controller, called extreme Shape
Controller (XSC) [8] has already been used in highly shaped conﬁgurations, whereas an
optimised equilibrium code EQUINOX [9] solves the Grad-Shafranov equation, taking
into account also internal magnetic measurements, like polarimetry, on a ﬁnite element
mesh instead of a regular grid like EFIT.

These new tools were extensively used in the last years and they contributed

signiﬁcantly to the scientiﬁc program of the entire experiment. For example they
constituted an indispensable prerequisite for some of the most ambitious feedback
programs, like the simultaneous control of current and density proﬁles. These control
schemes made extensive use also of JET actuators, which toroidal, poloidal and divertor
coils, gas fuelling, neutral beam injection and Radio Frequency (ICRH) and Lower
Hybrid (LH) waves.

JET real-time system is also a good environment to test innovative computational
concepts, both software, like Digital Neural Networks (DNN) [10], and hardware, like
the new chip technology of Cellular Neural/Nonlinear Networks (CNN) [11]. The
information and experience matured at JET in years of real time developments provides
also a good basis in the perspective of ITER. JET architecture and general approach,
implementing a distributed system, could be successfully translated to ITER. On the
other hand, on the route to the next step, the validation of new measurement techniques
for some physical quantities of reactor relevance is still required.

With regard to the structure of the paper, the architecture of JET real time control
and the main diagnostics and codes available in real time are reported in section 2.
Some of the most recent and interesting feedback experiments, heavily relying on the
new real time diagnostics and algorithms, are described in section 3 and 4. More
advanced approaches, still under development, for real time elaboration of diagnostic
data, involving soft computing and hardware neural Networks, are the subject of section
5. The main problems to be faced in developing diagnostic concepts for ITER a reviewed
in section 6.

2. Architecture of JET real time control system and diagnostics

JET real time control implements a distributed system, with many independent stations,
communicating via an ATM protocol [12]. This multi-platform approach (PCI, VME
etc) oﬀers several advantages, with respect to the mainframe, centralised solutions,
which were more popular in the past also in the ﬁeld of Nuclear Fusion. One of the main
characteristics of the present architecture is its great ﬂexibility, which is essential in such
a fast evolving ﬁeld, with diagnostics and feedback algorithms being continuously added
or upgraded. The potential of the adopted solution to implement parallel computing is
also a very important feature, which is not to be neglected given the fast time response
of many plasma phenomena to be controlled and the quantity of data to be processed
in next step machines. It is therefore strongly believed that JET approach should be
considered a very good reference for ITER real time control system.

The ﬂexible and adaptive architecture of JET control system has allowed including
many new diagnostics in the real time project in a very eﬃcient way. Now the vast
majority of the most relevant measurements, from the equilibrium to the conﬁnement
parameters, are routinely available in real time [3]. Also kinetic and proﬁle quantities
are provided with more than satisfactory time and space resolution, as can be seen from
the summary table 1.

From table 1 it is very apparent the remarkable progress of JET diagnostics in
the direction of the real time, which is now not limited to the traditional magnetic
measurements for plasma positioning and control. The electron ﬂuid is nowadays quite
well diagnosed, since the temperature is given by the ECE and the density can be
obtained from both the interferometer and the LIDAR Thomson Scattering. The ECE
radiometer comprises 96 tuned heterodyne microwave receivers covering the much of
the radial extent of the plasma, for most toroidal ﬁelds. The real time algorithm
acquires the 96 signals and, after proper ﬁltering, applies calibration constants derived
from comparison with the absolute-reading ECE Michelson Fourier Interferometer,
providing proﬁles with 5ms time resolution. For the LIDAR system, the real time
approach consists of ﬁtting to pre-calculated intensities, depending on electron density
and temperature, the backscatter echo from the plasma. The system processes the data

in the almost same way as the inter-shot code in less than 10ms, resulting in 50 point
proﬁles at 4Hz (due to the repetition rate of the laser 250ms). The electron cycloctron
emission data allows in its turn the determination of the ρ∗T proﬁle [13]. On the basis of
the electron density, obtained by inversion of the interfometric measurements, the safety
factor proﬁle can also be calculated in real time, using the ﬂux surface topology obtained
by the pick up coils [4]. The last years have also witnessed a remarkable progress in
diagnosing the ion ﬂuid, whose temperature and velocity are now routinely provided
using Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy [6].
In particular the toroidal
velocity is considered particularly relevant and it could be exploited much further in the
future for very interesting feedback schemes, like the control of ion ITBs.

The shown performances have been obtained thanks to signiﬁcant improvements

become more reliable and communication technologies has also witnessed dramatic steps
forward. From the point of view of data analysis, providing a quantity in real time mainly
implies very often a critical revision of the oﬀ-line algorithms, to ﬁnd a trade oﬀ between
accuracy and time resolution. Proper approximations, linearization of quantities and
adoption of robust ﬁtting routines, together with careful software engineering, are the
main ingredient, which normally can grant the desired results, both in terms of accuracy
and time resolution.

It is also worth noting that not only a quite comprehensive set of signals is available
in real time at JET but also some fundamental derived quantities are calculated, by
optimised and reliable codes. Particularly interesting are all the basic conﬁnement
quantities, obtained from the Shafranov integrals [7], and the magnetic equilibrium
from the magnetic measurements (EQUINOX code) [9], as again reported in table 1. In
the case of these codes, a reasonable compromise between the accuracy of the derived
quantities and the computational eﬀorts is again an essential ingredient of a successful
strategy for providing satisfactory and reliable information. This was already achieved
in the case of EQUINOX making use only of the external coils and now the attention is
concentrating on ﬁnalising the version of the code capable of accommodating also the
internal measurements (polarimetry and MSE).

3. Control of highly shaped plasmas

As mentioned in the introduction, the main drives behind the development of real
time diagnostics at JET are the requirements of the scenarios and the advanced
physics. Recently the research on the Elmy H mode has moved in the direction of
producing plasmas with increased elongation and triangularity. These strongly shaped
conﬁgurations are quite vulnerable to signiﬁcant deformations of the shape in presence
of strong variations of βpol and/or the internal inductance li. In this framework, a new
controller, called the eXtreme Shape Controller (XSC) [8] was explicitly designed at

namely 8 Poloidal Coils, are available to control the plasma shape, which is described in

Real Time Diagnostics and Feedback Algorithms for JET

terms of a set of geometrical descriptors (GAPs). These GAPs are the distance of the last
closed ﬂux surface from the ﬁrst wall along predeﬁned directions. They are obtained from
the magnetic measurements of ﬁelds, ﬂuxes and ﬂux diﬀerences by standard analysis
methods. The previous shape controller (SC) was conceived to perform the feedback
control on each of the 8 actuators by using as inputs to the system either the currents
ﬂowing into the Poloidal Circuits (current control) or a limited number of the actual
measured GAPs (GAP Control). The new XSC receives the errors on 38 indicators of the
plasma shape (32 GAPs plus the two coordinates of the X and the two strike points)
and calculates the ”smallest” currents needed to minimize the error on the ”overall”
shape in a least square sense.

The design of the XSC for JET single-null conﬁgurations is based on a linearised
plasma model approach, implemented by the CREATE-L and CREATE-NL codes [14].
These plasma-modeling tools were speciﬁcally adjusted for JET topology, taking into
account both the iron core and the eddy currents induced in the passive structures.

and Ip. The yellow region indicates the distance between the target shape and the one
really achieved by the controller

Real Time Diagnostics and Feedback Algorithms for JET

With regard to the controller implementation, the chosen approach identiﬁes the
principal directions of the algebraic mapping between coil currents and geometrical
descriptors using the singular value decomposition (SVD). These principal directions
can be translated into 8 linear combinations of currents, which represent one linear
combination of geometrical descriptors each. Such an approach allows solving the
original multivariable control problem using a set of separate PID controllers. To
alleviate the burden on the actuators, the SVD orders the principal directions as a
function of the current to shape sensitivity and normally only the ﬁrst 5 or 6 directions
(out of 8) are used. The control algorithm is optimized to obtain the most eﬃcient
distribution of the control currents, compromising between the eﬀort of the actuators
and the tracking error on the plasma shape.

As a consequence of this diﬀerent approach, the XSC manages to achieve the desired
shape with typically an average error of about 1cm on the 48 descriptors. An example of
the capability of the XSC is reported in ﬁgure 1, which shows the diﬀerence between the
desired and obtained shape for a quite extreme situation a the end of a JET discharge.
The controller manages to keep the shape more or less constant even in the presence
of large variations of βp, li and also Ip. In general the XSC has already been tested
successfully for variations ∆li up to 0.5 and ∆βp up to 1.5.

4. Control of proﬁles and ITBs in advanced scenarios

A linearisation approach has been adopted also for the control of the current and pressure
proﬁles. The long term objective of this program consists of being able to sustain internal
transport barriers (ITB) in high performance plasmas, with a large bootstrap current
fraction and possibly to reach steady state operation (’advanced tokamak’ program). In
the case of these ”advanced tokamak scenarios”, the challenges to the control become
particularly severe because the non-linear coupling between the pressure and current
proﬁles is particularly involved, given the relevant fraction of bootstrap currents and
the presence of ITBs. In order to have reasonable chances of success the plasma must
be controlled on the time scale of both the current diﬀusion and the thermal evolution.
Moreover, the adopted approach must preserve the distributed nature of the problem,
because accurate control of the proﬁles must be achieved in order to properly inﬂuence
the barriers. A linearised, model based, distributed control system was therefore adopted
for the simultaneous control of the q and ρ∗T proﬁles [15].

The objective of the experiments reported in this paper consisted of demonstrating
for the ﬁrst time the feasibility of simultaneous combined control of the current and
electron pressure proﬁles in presence of internal transport barriers. This was obtained
with a lumped-parameter version of the theoretical method, in which the spatial current
and pressure proﬁles where described by a suitable set of basis functions constrained
at 5 and 3 radii respectively. The designed multiple-input- multiple-output (MIMO)
controller operates all the three available heating and current drive actuators (NBI,
LHCD and ICRF) during the high power phase of the discharge. The chosen scenario

was a typical reversed shear conﬁguration obtained with 2.5MW LHCD in the preheat
phase during which the plasma current was ramped up to 1.7MA, at a line integrated
plasma density about 3 × 1019m−2. The determination of the steady-state responses to
variations of the heating and current drive powers was obtained from the analysis of
four dedicated open loop discharges [13].

Time evolution of ρ∗T toward the set points during the control phase

In ﬁgure 2a the time evolution of q at the ﬁve controlled points is reported, to show
how the target values are properly achieved. The evolution of the ρ∗T proﬁle in the
controlled region is reported in ﬁgure 2b, from which it can be seen how the controller
manages to force the plasma also toward this request, in parallel with the control of the
current. A more intuitive representation of the relevant physical quantities is reported
in ﬁgure 3 for the shot number 62527, in which a weak barrier was controlled in real
time with a reversed shear proﬁle. It must be mentioned that the control was achieved
on time scales much shorter than the local resistive time, mainly due to the limitations
of the actuators. So, even the proﬁle control was demonstrated for the ﬁrst time, the
robustness of the approach will have to be conﬁrmed by longer duration pulses.

The obtained stabilisation of a barrier for almost the entire shot and with two
diﬀerent q proﬁles is a very interesting result, which could have various applications
in JET future experimental program. The robustness of the controller, with regard
to ELMs and strong MHD activity is also an important aspect for JET and in ITER
perspective.

control

of sophisticated diagnostics and advance control algorithm, are all based on the

standard approach of linearisation. Moreover, to guarantee the necessary reliability,
they also tend to rely on commercial technology. On the other hand, in many ﬁelds
a lot of progress has been recently made in real time computational concepts and
components and therefore more innovative solutions can be envisaged. In the present
section, results of some new approaches using Digital Neural Networks (DNN) [10]
and Cellular Neural/Nonlinear Networks (CNN) [11] are presented, to illustrate the
potential applications of recent software developments and hardware technologies. These
innovative computational approaches were applied to particularly diﬃcult problems like
tomographic reconstructions and fast image processing.

From the point of view of data analysis, tomographic reconstructions are considered
In general tomographic inversions are

ill posed problems, in the sense the more than one solution is compatible with the
experimental data and this diﬃculty is strongly aggravated by the poor accessibility
of fusion machines. Moreover, given the topology of the emission in JET, the relation
between the total radiated power and the line-integrated measurements is a non-linear
one. Therefore, due also to the computational complexity of the task, in order to
obtain the total radiated power and the power emitted in the divertor in real time, it
was decided to try speciﬁcally designed DNNs and train them using the total emitted
power derived from the tomographic reconstrunctions. A multilayer perceptron, with
one layer of hidden units trained with an error back-propagation learning algorithm,
resulted more than adequate to the task. For the activation function a sigmoid was
chosen, to make the DNNs nonlinear transfer functions. In addition to 28 bolometric

Real Time Diagnostics and Feedback Algorithms for JET

10

chords also three geometrical factors (elongation, upper and lower triangularities) were
included in the set of inputs. The training set included about 2700 patterns for the
divertor conﬁguration and 250 patterns for the limiter conﬁguration. The percentage
of the DNN estimates that fall in the ±20% intervals, centered on the total radiation
calculated with the tomographic reconstruction, is more than 90%. Within an interval
of ±10% with respect to the tomographic inversion, which is a value comparable with
the error bars of the method, fall almost 85% of the DNN estimates and comparable
results are obtained for the evaluation of the radiation emitted in the divertor region.

In addition to the accuracy, also the generalization capability of the DNNs should
be emphasized. As shown in ﬁgure 4, the designed DNN is capable of following the
evolution of the total radiated power during ELMs, even if ELMs were not included
in its training set. This constitutes a quantitative prove of the more general, even if
qualitative result, i.e. that DNNs perform better than other possible linear methods
particularly in the case of unusual and unforeseen situations, a fact which of course
could be of great relevance in the perspective of ITER.

Figure 4. NN estimate of the total radiated power during ELMs

In current-generation tokamaks, the plasma shape is of primary importance not
only for protection and control but also for achieving better fusion performance. The
accurate localisation of the strike points on the divertor plates is essential to estimate
the power load on the protection tiles, which aﬀects the recycling properties of the
conﬁguration and bears strong consequences on operation safety. For many years, at
JET the magnetic reconstruction of the separatrix done by the XLOC code has provided
quite accurate and robust results. On the other hand, a known weakness of the magnetic

Real Time Diagnostics and Feedback Algorithms for JET

information is its vulnerability to non-contemplated deviations caused by eddy currents
induced in the metallic structures by fast transients. Moreover, in the perspective of
ITER, the long pulse mode of operation raises several questions about the stability of
the magnetic measurements, which have not been tackled yet.

A possible alternative and/or support to the magnetic reconstruction approach
could reside in the use of visual information, for example to identify the position of the
strike points. In this perspective signiﬁcant amount of work has been recently devoted
to developing a technology capable of providing the localisation of the strike points

of image processing for these applications is typically the need to obtain the required
output on a millisecond time scale to follow fast phenomena like the ELMs. To meet
these requirements, great attention has been devoted to the CNN technology. CNNs are
two dimensional arrays of simple, identical, locally interconnected nonlinear dynamic
circuits, called cells. These cells are arranged in a rectangular grid where each cell

fast algorithms for image processing. The version of the chip tested at JET is a new
generation 128x128 Focal-Plane Analog Programmable Array Processor (FPAPAP).
Manufactured in a 0.35µm standard digital 1P-5M CMOS Technology. The chip,
identiﬁred by the acronym ACE16K, contains about four millions transistors, 80% of
them working in analog mode, with relatively low power consumption (< 4W , i.e. less
than 1µW per transistor). The heart of the chip is an array of 128x128 identical,
locally interacting, analog processing units designed for high speed image processing
tasks requiring moderate accuracy (around 8bits).

Although ACE16K is essentially an analog processor (computation is carried out
in the analog domain), it can be operated in a fully digital environment. For this
purpose, the prototype incorporates a bank of Digital-to-Analog (for input) and Analog-
to- Digital (for output) converters at the images I/O port. ACE16K is conceived for
two alternative modes of operation. First, in applications where the images to be
processed are directly acquired by the optical input module of the chip, and second,
as a conventional image co-processor working in parallel with a digital hosting system
that provides and receives the images in electrical form. This second operational mode
is the only one tested so far at JET. The images of JET CCD visible camera (KL1
diagnostic, dynamical range of 8 bits, CCD-chip with 751x582 pixels), viewing the
divertor in a nearly tangential geometry, were used as input (see ﬁg.5). The information
representative of the Strike point position can be derived by the brightness of the image.
A suitable algorithm has been devised to extract the co- ordinates of the strike points
from the camera images. A typical result is reported in ﬁgure 5.

The CNNs guarantee high speed and extreme accuracy in the detection of strong
features in images, like the position of the strike points. The prospects of the image
processing to capture the strike points look very promising. At the moment the main
research is in the direction of investigating the maximum speed of the chip. With regard
to the algorithms for the identiﬁcation of the strike points, the preliminary comparison

Real Time Diagnostics and Feedback Algorithms for JET

12

of the CNN results with the estimated of XLOC based on the magnetic measurements
is more than satisfactory. The application of the same approach to infrared cameras,
instead of the usual CCD for the visible, is also considered relatively straightforward,
since the pixels of these sensors are normally read with CMOS circuits. In the reactor
perspective, the main weakness of this technology resides in its low radiation hardness.
Even if CMOS components are more robust than CCD the qualiﬁcation of these 2D
detectors for neutron ﬂuxes of ITER level remains an open question and potentially an
interesting ﬁeld of research.

6. Conclusions and ITER prospects

JET real time control system nowadays includes a wide set of diagnostics, covering
the magnetic conﬁguration, the current proﬁle and the main kinetic parameters of the
electron and ion ﬂuid. These measurements are complemented by other relevant tools,
which provide derived quantities of major interest like the plasma position, shape and
topology. The implemented multi-platform architecture, based on industry transmission
standards, combines the desired ﬂexibility with the robustness required by JET program.
These new tools were an essential prerequisite of some of the most ambitious feedback
program at JET. The implementation of the XSC is not only extremely relevant for
the next years experimental program but was also an unique opportunity to test ITER
control techniques of the shape, based on calculating the plasma response models directly
from equilibrium codes. The simultaneous control of the current and pressure proﬁle
constitutes one of the most signiﬁcant programs on the route to the feedback control
of ITBs. New and more advanced approached, based on soft computing, were also
validated. Innovative technologies are also promoted, particularly in the ﬁeld of real
time imaging, which requires more advanced 2D sensors for some applications. From
the technological and architectural point of view, the present JET real time control
system seems therefore to provide a lot of useful information not only in support of the
experimental program but also for the design of ITER.

The relatively recent but substantial experience gathered on feedback control at
JET in the last years allows assessing which are the main requirements the diagnostics
have to fulﬁl in general to become good candidates for real time.
In order to use
the measurement of a certain physical quantity in real time, an established method
to measure it must be available. A sound interpretation of the data is essential and
the information provided needs to be suﬃciently closed to the plasma parameter to
be controlled. In this respect, a good example of a diﬃcult diagnostic to interpret is
the MSE, if this measurement is to be used to control the q proﬁle. Since the MSE
is a local measurement whereas the deﬁnition of q is an average over a ﬂux surface,
delicate calculations are needed to derive the correct information for the control from the
direct measurements [16]. Another delicate aspect of real time diagnostics is reliability,
which is not limited to the hardware and basic interpretative software but has also to
take into account possible disturbances from the environment. This means that the

diagnostic must be robust enough to produce acceptable data even in case of major and
unforeseen variations of the plasma parameters or the mode of operation (ELMs, limiter
and divertor conﬁgurations etc). The calibration of the diagnostic is also a signiﬁcant
issue. An established procedure is necessary, which does not need to be carried out
necessarily in real time but must be stable enough to guarantee meaningful outputs at
least for the all discharge. The time constant of the measurement technique and the
computational time necessary to interpret it have obviously also to be compatible with
the plasma phenomena to be controlled. Given the rate of development of computers, it
is very likely that in the perspective of ITER silicon technology, particularly if organised
in parallel architectures, will be able to provide enough computational power even in
the case of the most demanding diagnostics. On the other hand, for some essential
parameters of interest for ITER physics and operation, no measurement technique is
completely established yet. The most delicate ﬁeld is certainly the one of burning plasma
diagnostics. The measurements of the isotopic composition, the He ash, the slowing
down and lost alphas require very signiﬁcant eﬀorts to identify the most suitable concepts
even for providing reliable data, letting alone the real time aspects.
In the case of
neutrons, even if quite sound approaches have been tested at JET for the determination
of the total yield, already available in real time, high-resolution spectrometry is still a
controversial issue. More work is certainly required in particular to identify solutions,
which could provide basic information, like the yield of thermal neutrons, with the
potential of providing Qthermal in real time. Other weaknesses of present day Tokamak
diagnostics are certainly the measurement of the current density and temperature at the
edge. For these quantities also a very high time resolution would be necessary, to be able
to follow edge fast phenomena like the ELMs. One additional category of measurements
very problematic for ITER are the diagnostics for the divertor. The temperature,
erosion and redeposition of the divertor plates require signiﬁcant developments of present
techniques. Moreover the plasma parameters are going to be so extreme in ITER divertor
that also the basic measurements of electron density and temperature are believed to
be very diﬃcult in that environment.
In all these ﬁelds the identiﬁcation of reliable
methods are of course a prerequisite to attack the issue of providing the measurements
in real time.

It must also be kept in mind that in ITER, a global control system, using all
or almost all the available actuators (coils, gas injection, coolant, additional heating,
tritium etc.), could become indispensable. In this respect, a lot of work remains to be
done not only to signiﬁcantly develop actuators and sensors, particularly in the direction
of an increased reliability, but also in devising and testing ”integrated” approaches, of
both adequate complexity and realistic robustness.

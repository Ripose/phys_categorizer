In a recent paper ˇSijaˇci´c and Ebert have systematically studied the transition from Townsend to
glow discharge, refering to older work from von Engel (1934) up to Raizer (1991), and they stated
a strong dependendence on secondary emission γ from the cathode. We here show that the earlier
results of von Engel and Raizer on the small current expansion about the Townsend limit actually
are the limit of small γ of the new expression; and that for larger γ the old and the new results vary
by no more than a factor of 2. We discuss the γ-dependence of the transition which is rather strong
for short gaps.

In the recent article [1], the transition from Townsend
to glow discharge was re-investigated with analytical and
numerical means. On the analytical side, a systematic
small current expansion about the Townsend limit was
performed and it was stated:

“The result agrees qualitatively with the one given by
Raizer [2] and Engel and Steenbeck [3].
In particular,
the leading order correction is also of order α′′(j/µ)2.
However, the explicit coeﬃcient of j2 diﬀers: while the
coeﬃcient in [2, 3] does not depend on γ at all, we ﬁnd
that the dependence on γ is essential, as the plot of F
in Fig. 1 (of [1]) clearly indicates.
In fact, within the
relevant range of 10−6 ≤ γ ≤ 100, this coeﬃcient varies
by almost four orders of magnitude. We remark that it
indeed would be quite a surprising mathematical result
if the Townsend limit itself would depend on γ, but the
small current expansion about it would not.”

Here we remark that while the new systematic calcu-
lation was correct, the interpretation and comparison to
earlier work requires some correction.

To be precise, the model treated in [1, 2, 3] and by
many other authors is a one-dimensional time indepen-
dent Townsend or glow discharge characterized by the
classical equations

∂xJe = |Je| ¯α(|E|),
e
ǫ0

∂xE =

(n+ − ne),

∂xJ+ = |Je| ¯α(|E|),

for electron and ion particle current

Je = −neµeE,

J+ = n+µ+E,

and electric ﬁeld E. Impact ionization in the bulk of the
discharge is given by the Townsend approximation

¯α(|E|) = α0 e−E0/|E|.

(In [1], the generalized case ¯α(|E|) = α0 exp (−E0/|E|)s
was treated.) Since ions are generated by impact within
the gap and drift towards the cathode, there are no ions
at the anode at x = 0

n+(0) = 0.

The ions impacting on the cathode liberate free electrons
with rate γ, therefore secondary emission from the cath-
ode is given by

(6)

(7)

(9)

where x = d is the position at the cathode. The electrical
potential diﬀerence between the electrodes is

|Je(d)| = γ |J+(d)|,

U =

dx E(x),

d

Z
0

and the total electric current is

J = e (n+µ+ + neµe) E,

∂xJ = 0.

(8)

It is useful to introduce dimensionless voltage and cur-

rent

u =

U
E0/α0

,

¯j =

J
ǫ0α0E0 µ+E0

,

where ¯j = j/µ with the deﬁnition of j from [1]. It should
be noted that only bulk gas parameters have been used
as units; therefore the dimensionless u and ¯j are inde-
pendent of γ.

Further dimensional analysis yields that the current-
voltage-characteristics u = u(¯j) can depend on three pa-
rameters only, namely on the dimensionless gap length
L = α0d, on the coeﬃcient γ of secondary emission and
on the mobility ratio µ = µ+/µe. In practice, the depen-
dence on the small parameter µ is almost negligibly weak
[1], therefore u = u(¯j, L, γ). Here the dimensionless gap
length L is related to pd through L = A pd as long as the
coeﬃcient α0 is related to pressure like α0 = Ap.

How strongly does the characteristics u = u(¯j, L, γ)
depend on γ? In [1], ˇSijaˇci´c and Ebert calculated the
whole Townsend-to-glow regime numerically and derived
by expanding systematically in powers of current ¯j about
the Townsend limit

u = uT − ASE ¯j2 + O(¯j3),

and ET and uT are ﬁeld and potential in the Townsend
limit of “vanishing” current, i.e., with breakdown values

ET =

ln(L/Lγ)

,

uT =

L
ln(L/Lγ)

.

The minimal potential uT is Lγe1, it is attained for gap
length L = Lγe1 on the Paschen curve uT = uT (L) [1, 2,
3].

In [1], it was argued that the coeﬃcient ASE in (10)
strongly depends on γ due to the factor F (γ, µ) in (11).
This factor strongly depends on γ, for small γ actually
in leading order like L3
γ/12. (Note that there is a dis-
crepancy between equation (50) in [1] for F (γ, µ) which
is reproduced as Eq. (13) in the present paper, and the
plot in Fig. 1 of [1] for 10−1 < γ < 100. Equation (50) in
[1] is correct and the ﬁgure erroneous. F (γ, µ) actually
varies by ﬁve orders of magnitude on 10−6 < γ < 100,
not only by four.)

At this point, the question how the remaining factor
depends on γ was omitted.
In fact, the denominator
(αET )3 in (10) has in leading order the same strong de-
pendence on γ, since

(αET )3 =

Lγ

(cid:18)

,

(cid:19)

ln(L/Lγ)

(15)

according to the Townsend breakdown criterion αL =
Lγ, cf. (12)–(14). Therefore the leading order depen-
γ of the coeﬃcient of ¯j2 in (10) is cancelled
dence on L3
and replaced by a dependence on L3, while the term with
α′′ has the classical explicit form

ET α′′

ln(L/Lγ) − 2

.

(16)

In [2, 3], another small current expansion was derived
from (1)–(3), assuming n+ ≫ ne and n+(x) ≈ const.
This approximation was criticised in [1], since it is in
contradiction with the boundary condition (5) — how-
ever, for very small γ, it is a good approximation in a
large part of the gap. The resulting equations (8.8) and
(8.10) from [2] read in the notation of the present paper

(Here a misprint in [2] was corrected, namely the missing
factor UT in the coeﬃcient of J 2 in (17), and the factor
1/(8π) in (8.8) is substituted by ǫ0/2 in (18), since we
here write the Poisson equation (2) in MKS units rather
than in Gaussian units, cf. (8.6) in [2].)

In (17), the physical current density J is compared to
JL. JL is the current density where deviations from the
Townsend limit through space charges start to occur; it
explicitly depends on γ through UT (14).

Comparison of the results of ˇSijaˇci´c/Ebert (SE) (10)
and Engel/Raizer (ER) (17) show that the coeﬃcients
ASE,ER in the expansion (10) are related like

ASE = AER

, AER =

12 F (γ, µ)

. (19)

The coeﬃcients ASE and AER depend in the same way on
L, and they are essentially independent of µ for realistic
values of µ. Therefore the ratio ASE/AER depends only
on γ as shown in Fig. 1. For γ → 0, the ratio tends to
unity. For a large range of γ values, the deviation is not
too large, approaching a factor 0.44 for γ = 10−1.

FIG. 1: The ratio ASE/AER of the small current expansions
by ˇSijaˇci´c/Ebert and Engel/Raizer as a function of γ.

Fig. 2 shows that the factor ASE indeed strongly de-

pends on γ for the given L.

The strong dependence of ASE or AER on γ for a
given short gap length L means that we can obtain both
negative and positive diﬀerential resistance dU/dJ close
to the Townsend limit for the same gap length. There-
fore the choice of γ is important since it can change the
diﬀerential conductivity and therefore the stability of a
Townsend discharge in a short gap.

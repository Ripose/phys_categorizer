Abstract

A necessary condition for existence of general dissipative magneto-
hydrodynamic equilibria is derived. The ingredients of the derivation
are Ohm’s law and the existence of magnetic surfaces, only in the sense
of KAM theorem. All other equations describing the system matter
exclusively for the evaluation of the condition in a concrete case.

Conditions for existence of long time equilibria of hot magnetically con-
ﬁned plasmas is an important question in fusion research. Such plasmas are
weakly collisional and obey kinetic-Maxwell equations. Conditions for exis-
tence of such equilibria are not known neither within the frame of neoclassi-
cal theory nor in resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Since neoclassical
theory should match with classical theory in the highly collisional limit, it
is of interest to derive long time equilibrium conditions for the macroscopic
equations. The modest purpose of this note is to derive necessary equilibrium
conditions within the frame of resistive viscous MHD

The basic equations for resistive viscous MHD equilibria are (see e.g.

Ref.[1])

ρv · ∇v = j × B − ∇p − ν∇ × ∇ × v + source(momentum),

(1)

E + v × B = η · j +

(j × B − ∇pe),

λ
ρ

∇ · ρv = source(mass),
∇ · B = 0,
∇ × E = 0,
∇ × B = j,

where ρ is the mass density, ν is the viscosity and η the anisotropic resistivity.
p is the total pressure, pe is the pressure of the electron ﬂuid, v and B are
the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld, E and j are the electric ﬁeld and the
electric current density.

Since only Ohm’s law (2) and equations (4)-(5) will be used in the deriva-
tion, the other equations can be modiﬁed to accomodate for additional physi-
cal sophistication. Another important ingredient is the existence of a volume
bounded by magnetic surfaces. Due to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM)
theorem (see e.g. Ref.[2]) this is a mild assumption even for three dimen-
sional equilibria.

Let us take the scalar product of Eq.(2) with the magnetic ﬁeld to obtain

B · ∇Φ = B · η · j −

B · ∇pe,

(7)

where E has been replaced by ∇Φ because of Eq.(5). We integrate now
throughout any volume bounded by two magnetic surfaces. By Gauss the-
orem and Eq.(4) the gradient term on the RHS of Eq.(7) vanishes if the

electron ﬂuid is barotropic, pe(ρ), or if the electron temperature is constant
along the magnetic ﬁeld lines. The integral of the ﬁrst term on the LHS
either vanishes if the potential Φ is single valued or is proportional to the
loop voltage if the potential is multi valued.

• Tokamak case: Since the transformer produces a toroidal loop volt-

age, the above integration leads to

F VL =

dτ B · η · j,

ZKAM

where F is the toroidal magnetic ﬂux, VL the toroidal loop voltage and
dτ the volume element.

• Stellarator case: Since no electric ﬁeld is induced, the potential is

single valued, so the above integration leads to

(8)

(9)

dτ B · η · j = 0.

ZKAM

Conditions (8) and (9) are only necessary since they do not need the full
system (1)-(6) for their derivation. They give, however, a qualitative insight
of how the current density has to behave in order to fulﬁl the stationarity
condition. The evaluation of the nonlocal conditions (8) and (9) needs the
knowledge of the KAM surfaces in the three dimensional MHD equilibrium
as well as the resistivity tensor, the magnetic ﬁeld and the current density.
For many axisymmetric equilibria the magnetic surfaces are known as well
as the magnetic ﬁeld and the current density. In the latter case one can ﬁnd
local conditions for existence of resistive MHD incompressible equilibria and
even solve the full system (1)-(6) as demonstrated in Ref.[3]. The nonlocal
conditions (8) and (9) apply, however, to any toroidal MHD equilibrium
without restricting the number of dimensions by symmetry.

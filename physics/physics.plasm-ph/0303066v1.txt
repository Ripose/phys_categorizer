Dynamical analysis of the nonlinear growth of the m = n = 1 resistive internal mode

(Dated: October 29, 2013)

A dynamical analysis is presented that self-consistently takes into account the motion of the
critical layer, in which the magnetic ﬁeld reconnects, to describe how the m = n = 1 resistive
internal kink mode develops in the nonlinear regime. The amplitude threshold marking the onset of
strong nonlinearities due to a balance between convective and mode coupling terms is identiﬁed. We
predict quantitatively the early nonlinear growth rate of the m = n = 1 mode below this threshold.

The large scale dynamics and conﬁnement properties
of tokamak plasmas depend intimately on the behavior
of m = n = 1 magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) internal
kink modes. This has motivated an intense, long-lasting,
experimental and theoretical research, notably devoted
to study their implication in magnetic reconnection or as
triggers of the sawtooth oscillations and crashes. These
phenomena typically proceed beyond the linear regime,
that is now rather well understood but assumes very
small amplitudes of the modes. To oﬀer a quantitative,
predictive description of their nonlinear manifestations
remains a diﬃcult objective of both academic interest
and very practical importance. This is especially relevant
for the design of fusion burn experiments in which the ful-
ﬁlment of linear stability constraints is challenged by the
search for ignition. Such devices are thus expected to op-
erate at best close to marginal stability for the m = n = 1
ideal mode so that nonlinear eﬀects come into play for
fairly small values of the mode amplitude [1, 2].

In this Letter, we focus on the m = n = 1 resis-
tive mode [3] in which a ﬁnite resistivity η destabilizes
the otherwise marginally stable ideal MHD internal kink
mode. Since Kadomtsev’s scenario [4] predicting the
complete reconnection of the helical ﬂux within the q = 1
surface on a timescale of order η−1/2, that later appeared
too large to account for observations, the nonlinear be-
havior of the m = n = 1 mode has become a some-
what controversial issue. Some numerical simulations
suggested that the mode still grows exponentially into
the nonlinear regime [5] which was supported by a the-
oretical model [6]. Later some analytic studies [7], sup-
ported by numerical simulations [8], rather predicted a
transition to an algebraic growth early in the nonlinear
stage. This result was challenged by Aydemir’s recent
simulations using a dynamical mesh [9]. These did show
the linear exponential stage evolving towards an alge-
braic stage, yet this was brutally interrupted by a second
nonlinear exponential growth. A modiﬁed Sweet-Parker
model was able to ﬁt continuously both stages of evo-
lution [9] and the transition related to a change in the
geometry of the current sheet [10]. However, some funda-
mental questions remain unanswered or unclear. Among
them, how to relate the transition threshold with η ? or

what is the role of the q-proﬁle ? The aim of this Letter
is to describe analytically how the m = n = 1 resistive
mode develops in the nonlinear regime, by focusing on
the equations controlling plasma dynamics.

We consider MHD equilibria given by φ0 = 0 and by
an helical magnetic ﬂux ψ0 (r), related to the safety pro-
ﬁle q(r) through drψ0 = r [1
1/q(r)], such that q = 1
for an internal radius r = rs0. Thus drψ0 (rs0) = 0. This
means that the low-frequency ideal linear equations asso-
ciated to (1)-(2) are singular at r = rs0, with a formally
diverging current density. This marks the presence of a
critical layer in which the dynamics diﬀers considerably
from the outer one and where resistivity enters to cure
the singularity.

We wish to analyse perturbatively the time evolution
of the m = 1 mode. For this, we assume that only the
m = 1 mode is destabilized initially with an amplitude
A0, neglect all ideal MHD transients and restrict to the

realize that two small parameters are indeed competing
in this problem, namely the small given resistivity η and
the time-dependent amplitude A(τ ) of the linear m = 1
mode. This introduces some subtleties in the amplitude
expansion. The order one solution is given by linear the-
ory using an asymptotic analysis [3] to match inner and
outer solutions. Excitation of the m = 1 mode leads to
a self-consistent correction to the location of the critical
layer. One estimates the amplitude threshold, scaling
with η, at which next order solution is required and the
procedure iterated. Separability in time and space prop-
agates at each order resulting in an amplitude expansion
in A. As in any perturbative approach, the solution is
formally known when the order one solution is. This is
given by the linear theory reviewed now.

which relates to the shift of the core plasma inside the q =

shift rs1 (α = π, τ ) goes like A(τ )/η1/3, consistently with
Aydemir’s numerical results [9]. Thus the critical radius
starts to leave the linear critical layer band, centered on
rs0, when rs1 (α, τ ) becomes of the order η1/3 for some
α, that is when A (τ ) & η2/3. This is again the threshold
marking the end of the linear stage. We need now to
deﬁne a generalized stretched coordinate in the critical

The second order critical layer equations involve an
inhomogeneous part composed of quadratic terms in the
order one solutions (5), (6) and (8). This acts to force
the growth of the m = 0 and m = 2 perturbations but
brings no contribution to the m = 1 dynamics. Therefore
the m = 1 equations (3)-(4) are unchanged, except that,
due to the motion of the critical layer (8), one needs to
replace κ0 in (3)-(4) by the time-dependent average

This introduces a generalized linear system of equations.
Neglecting the initially zero amplitudes of the m = 0 and
m = 2 perturbations in front of A(τ ), the second order
correction to the location of the critical layer is given by
−1 ψ′′′
0 (rs0) rs1 (α, τ )2. The va-
rs2 (α, τ )

when the instantaneous critical line moves out of the

w, that is to
some α. This corresponds to rs2 (α, τ )

threshold in the amplitude of the linear m = 1 mode
marks the onset of third order terms, that will contribute
again to the m = 1 dynamics. Its brutal manifestation
is visible on Aydemir’s plots [9]. They clearly report a
transition in the m = 1 kinetic energy when this becomes
10−8 for η = 10−7
of order η/2 [13], namely around 5
10−6 for η = 10−5.

At third order, cubic terms in the order one solutions
or quadratic terms coupling the m = 0 and m = 2 sec-
ond order terms to the m = 1 ﬁrst order ones appear
in the inhomogeneous part of the critical layer equations
and modify the m = 1 dynamics. These terms involve
(w−1)-
some radial derivatives, e.g. ∂rφ(1)
large only within the linear layer. Locality enters here the
analysis since the dominant contribution of these mode
coupling terms comes from the localized zone in (r, α)
where the instantaneous and linear critical layers over-
lap. This is depicted by the grey shaded region in Fig.
1. The novelty is that, in this region, mode couplings are
now able to balance convective derivatives, both being
dominant with respect to linear terms. More explicitly,
while, e.g.
in the Eq. (1) written in the region where
the instantaneous and linear critical layers overlap, the

Thus linear terms become negligible for A(τ )
which marks the onset of the fully nonlinear regime for
the m = 1 mode. Moreover, convective terms, e.g.

growth rate derives from this balance. As κ(0)(τ ) is no
longer involved in those convective and mode coupling
terms, there is no extra time-dependence in the domi-
nant equations, so that the nonlinear growth rate is just
equal, by continuity, to the growth rate of the m = 1
mode when A(τ ) becomes of order η1/2.
Its value de-
pends notably on the equilibrium q-proﬁle as we shall
see below. After some spatial averaging, a rough sum-
mary of the time evolution of the m = 1 mode amplitude
may be then ﬁnally written as

where the initial value of the growth rate γ (0) is γL and
where the early time dependence of γ comes from the
motion of the critical layer and is computed quantita-
tively below. In Eq. (10), c is a constant of order one
and tN L denotes the (magnitude of the) time at which A
becomes of order η1/2. Eq. (10) describes eﬀectively the
transition between two (almost) exponential stages. Be-
cause φ(1)

regime, Eq. (10) remains valid during some stage even if
the structure and scaling of the critical layer should sub-
stantially change as the generalized linear stage is left.

For the convective exponential stage to be fully valid,
the overlap between the linear and instantaneous critical
layers should be large enough. One expects then a qual-
itatively diﬀerent late behavior of the m = 1 dynamics if
the x-point region is far away from the linear layer when
, that is, due to (8), if η−1/6 ≫ 1. This
A(τ ) =
regime is extremely challenging to reach numerically but
may be satisﬁed in tokamak plasmas.

We ﬁnally examine the early nonlinear eﬀects on the
growth rate of the m = 1 mode due to the motion of the
critical layer. This amounts to solve the system of diﬀer-
ential equations (3)-(4) for κ0 replaced with κ(0) (τ ), de-
ﬁned in (9). It can be checked that, as long as the order of
magnitude of A (τ ) is lower than η1/2, κ(0) (τ ) may be ap-
0 [rs (α, τ )] dα at
proximated by (2π)
leading order. This expression will be retained in the nu-
merical computations. The time-dependent growth rate
is deﬁned as ˆγ (τ )
dτ A/A. In this generalized linear sys-
tem, there is one condition shared with the linear deriva-
tion:
for a solution in separate variables τ and x, it is
that ˆγ (τ ) /κ (τ ) be constant. This constant is then ﬁxed
by continuity with the linear solution at time zero giving

early nonlinear behavior of a variety of internal kinks
such as two-ﬂuid [15, 16, 17] and/or collisionless [18]

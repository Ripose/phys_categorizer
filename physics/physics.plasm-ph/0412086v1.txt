A short gas discharge layer sandwiched with a semiconductor layer between planar electrodes
shows a variety of spatio-temporal patterns. The paper focusses on the spatially homogeneous
spontaneous oscillations while a DC voltage is applied; the results on these homogeneous oscillations
apply equally to a planar discharge in series with any resistor with capacitance. We deﬁne the
minimal model, identify its independent dimensionless parameters and then present results of the
full time-dependent numerical solutions of the model as well as of a linear stability analysis of the
stationary state. Full numerical solutions and the results of the stability analysis agree very well.
The stability analysis is then used for calculating bifurcation diagrams. We ﬁnd semi-quantitative
agreement with experiment for the diagram of bifurcations from stationary to oscillating solutions
as well as for amplitude and frequency of the developing limit cycle oscillations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Gas discharges on the transition from Townsend to
glow regime exhibit a wealth of spatio-temporal struc-
tures. Besides striations, i.e., longitudinal waves in a long
discharge column [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], short discharges with wide
lateral aspect ratio can also exhibit rich spatio-temporal
structures in the transversal direction as reported by a
number of authors [6, 7, 8, 9]. This is even the case
when the externally applied voltage is stationary and the
gas is pure, as long as the system is sandwiched between
planar electrodes and at least one Ohmic layer. An in-
teresting sequence of experiments has been performed in
M¨unster [10, 11] where the bifurcations between diﬀerent
spatio-temporal states in parameter space were investi-
gated very systematically.

As in our previous paper [12], we focus in the present
one on the purely temporal oscillations that occur in a
spatially homogeneous mode. This focus has two reasons:
ﬁrst, understanding the temporal structures is a ﬁrst
systematic step towards understanding the full spatio-
temporal structures; second, there are numerous obser-
vations of temporal oscillations in comparable parameter
regimes [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. For the oscilla-
tions, the setup need not contain an Ohmic layer as in
[10, 11], a resistor with capacitance in the circuit will
have the same eﬀect on the gas discharge.

In the previous paper [12], we concentrated on the
question whether a simple two-component reaction-
diﬀusion model for current and voltage in the gas dis-
charge layer would be suﬃcient to describe the oscilla-
tions. Such a model is suggested through similarities
with patterns formed in a number of physical, chemical
or biological systems like the Belousov-Zhabotinski reac-
tion, Rayleigh-Benard convection, patterns in bacterial
colonies, in Dictyostelium or in nerval tissue etc. How-
ever, the actual results of a realistic gas discharge model
are in conﬂict with a simple two-component reaction dif-

fusion approximation that neglects the height and subse-
quent memory of the system. This can be seen, in par-
ticular, from the occurence of a period doubling cascade
as well as from analytical model reductions [12]. Similar
period doubling cascades are observed experimentaly in
[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].

In the present paper, we continue the analysis of the
full gas discharge model, coupled to a high-Ohmic layer
and driven by a stationary voltage. The focus is now on
quantitative comparison with experiment, on a stability
analysis and on the derivation of bifurcation diagram.
The speciﬁc experiment to be analyzed was performed in
nitrogen at 40 mbar within a gap of 0.5 or 1 mm wide
while the semiconductor was a layer of 1.5 mm photosen-
sitively doped GaAs. To the whole structure, voltages in
the range of 500 to 800 V were applied. As in our previous
papers [12, 27, 28], we restrict the analysis to the direc-
tion normal to the layers, hence assuming homogeneity
in the transversal directions. The experimental system
actually shows a transition from a homogeneous station-
ary to a homogeneous oscillating state, and the theory
presented here reproduces essential features of these ex-
periments. At the same time, the investigation serves
as a gauge point for a later analysis of spatio-temporal
patterns.

In detail, we deﬁne the model as a set of partial diﬀer-
ential equations and perform a dimensional analysis in
Section II. In Section III, ﬁrst the physical parameters
and the numerical details of solving the PDE’s in time
are given. Then qualitative and quantitative results of
numerical solutions and experiments are discussed.
In
particular, the hysteresis between stationary and oscil-
lating solutions is demonstrated numerically, amplitude
and frequency of the limit cycle oscillations as a function
of applied voltage and conductivity of the semiconductor
are compared with experimental results, and the physi-
cal mechanism of the oscillation is discussed. In Section
IV, it is explained how the stability analysis about a sta-

tionary solution of the complete system is performed. In
Section V, the results of the stability analysis are pre-
sented. First a convincing agreement between numerical
solutions of the full PDE’s and the stability analysis re-
sults is found. Then the stability analysis is used to cal-
culate bifurcation diagrams for the transition from sta-
tionary to oscillating states that are then compared with
experiment. The paper concludes with Section VI.

II. THE MODEL

The experiment consists of two layers, a gas discharge
and a semiconductor, sandwiched between two planar
electrodes to which a DC voltage is applied. In this sec-
tion, the equations are deﬁned and a dimensional anal-
ysis is performed to identify the independent parameter
combinations of the problem. This also serves to identify
physical processes and time scales.

A. Gas discharge layer

In the gas discharge, two ionization mechanisms coop-
erate to maintain conductivity: the so-called α process of
impact ionization in the bulk of the discharge, and the γ
process of secondary emission at the cathode. The clas-
sical “ﬂuid” approximation consists of continuity equa-
tions for electron density ne and positive ion density n+,
coupled to the Poisson equation for the electric ﬁeld E:

∂t ne + ∂rJe = source ,
∂t n+ + ∂rJ+ = source ,

∂rE =

(n+ − ne) .

e
ε0

(1)
(2)

(3)

The spatial coordinate r is normal to the layers, and in
the present paper, it is assumed that there are no vari-
ations in the transversal directions. The gas is assumed
to be non-attaching, i.e., no negative ions are formed.
Also photo-ionization, Ohmic heating, nonlocal interac-
tions and diﬀusion are neglected in this simplest approx-
imation. The particle current densities Je and J+ are
approximated by a drift motion that is linear in the ﬁeld

Je = −ne µe E ,

J+ = n+ µ+ E .

(4)

The source term on the right hand side of Eqs. (1) and
(2) is approximated by impact ionization in the classical
Townsend form

source = |neµeE| α0 e−E0/|E| .

(5)

2

This identity can be used to substitute Je or J+ by J(t).
In the present analysis, we will keep ne(r, t) and E(r, t)
as independent ﬁelds and express n+ and J+ by these
ﬁelds and the total current J(t).

The model is completed by boundary conditions on
the electrode. At the anode which is located at r = 0,
electrons are absorbed and ions are absent:

J+(0, t) = 0 ⇐⇒ n+(0, t) = 0 .

(7)

At the cathode which is located at r = d, impacting ions
can liberate electrons by secondary emission with rate γ:

|Je(d, t)| = γ |J+(d, t)| ⇐⇒ µene(d, t) = γµ+n+(d, t) .
(8)
Note that consistenly with [12, 27], but in contrast with
most other literature, the anode is on the left hand side
at r = 0. This has the advantage that the electric ﬁeld
is positive, and sign mistakes when evaluating E or |E|
cannot occur.

Substantial densities of charged particles change the
electric ﬁeld according to (3), and the electric ﬁeld deter-
mines drift and ionization rates of the particles according
to Eqs. (1), (2), (4) and (5). Therefore the process is non-
linear as soon as space charges become relevant. It causes
the well-known transition from the linear Townsend dis-
charge to the nonlinear glow discharge.

B. Semiconductor layer and complete circuit

The semiconductor layer of thickness ds is assumed to
have a homogeneous and ﬁeld independent conductivity
σs and dielectricity constant ǫs:

Js(t) = σsEs(t) ,

q = ǫsǫ0 ∂rE .

(9)

As there are no space charges in the bulk of the semicon-
ductor, the electric ﬁeld is homogeneous, and voltage and
ﬁeld are related through Us(t) = Es(t)ds. The equation
of charge conservation ∂tq + ∂rJs = 0 in one dimension
leads again to the homogeneity of the total current den-
sity J(t)

ǫsǫ0∂tEs(t) + Js(t) = J(t),

(10)

that is the same as in the gas discharge (6). Hence in
macroscopic parameters, the semiconductor solves

Cs∂tUs(t) + Js(t) = J(t)

, Us(t) = RsJs(t), (11)

Cs =

ǫsǫ0
ds

,

Rs =

(12)

ds
σs

.

The one-dimensional approximation of Eqs. (1), (2)
and (3) makes the total electric current J(t) homoge-
neous

where Cs is the capacitance per area.

According to (11), perturbations of Us(t) or Js(t) de-

cay on the Maxwell time scale

ǫ0∂tE(r, t) + eJe(r, t) + eJ+(r, t) = J(t)

,

∂rJ(t) = 0.
(6)

Ts = CsRs =

.

(13)

3

This time scale is independent of the thickness of the
semiconductor layer although it represents the time that
the charge needs to cross it. The time scale of the exper-
imentally observed oscillations is of the order of Ts, and
therefore also approximately proportional to 1/σs as will
be discussed in Section III.D.
for

investigation of one-
dimensional oscillations, the speciﬁc structure of a planar
semiconductor layer is not required, but any serial com-
ponent of the electric circuit with capacitance Cs and
resistance Rs will support the same equation (11).

According to (11) and (14), the dynamics of the voltage

C. Dimensional analysis and system deﬁnition

The dimensional analysis is performed as previously in
[12, 27, 28, 29]. We introduce the dimensionless coordi-
nates and ﬁelds

After eliminating the ion dynamics by the total current
j(τ ), the equation of motion of the gas discharge becomes

∂τ σ = ∂zje + jeα(E) ,
je = σE,
∂τ E = j(τ ) − (1 + µ)je − µE∂zE,

and the boundary conditions (7) and (8) read

∂τ E(0, τ ) = j(τ ) − je(0, τ ),

∂τ E(L, τ ) = j(τ ) −

je(L, τ ).

Hence the dynamics of the complete system is de-

tem is characterized completely by the independent di-
mensionless parameters µ, L and γ for the gas discharge
layer, τs and Rs for the semiconductor layer and the total
applied DC voltage Ut.

III. NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS OF THE
DYNAMICS

In this section, this dynamical model is solved numeri-
cally and the results are compared with experiments. We
discuss physical parameters under A and numerical de-
tails under B. In C, qualitative features of experimental
and numerical system are compared like the bistability
between stationary and oscillating state. In D, a quanti-
tative comparison between theory and experiment is per-
formed, and the dependence of amplitude and frequency
of the oscillation as a function of Ut and 1/Rs is deter-
mined numerically. Finally, in E, we discuss the mech-
anism of the oscillations and identify the surface charge
eﬀects that are inherent in our model.

A. Physical parameters

In the experiment [10], nitrogen at a pressure of 40
mbar was used in gaps with widths of 0.5 or 1 mm. The
article [10] contains mainly data for the 0.5 mm gap,
while the Ph.D. thesis [11] also contains more data for
1 mm. The gas discharge was coupled to a semiconduc-
tor layer of GaAs with a width of ds = 1.5 mm and a
dielectricity constant ǫs = 13.1. Through photosensi-
tive doping, the conductivity of the semiconductor layer
could be increased by about an order of magnitude; the
dark conductivity was σs = 3.2 · 10−8(Ωcm)−1. For the
discharge gap of 0.5 mm width, voltages in the range of
500 to 600 V were used; for the gap of 1 mm width, the
applied voltages were in the range of 580 to 740 V.

Of course, the predictive power of the theory depends
on the model approximations as well as on the chosen
parameters. Our simple classical model will not give fully
quantitative agreement. On the other hand, its simple
structure and few parameters give a chance of physical
understanding and control.

For the gas discharge, we used the ion mobility µ+ =
23.33 cm2/Vs and electron mobility µe = 6666.6 cm2/Vs.
For α0 = Ap = [27.78µm]−1 and E0 = Bp =
10.26 kV/cm, the value from [30] was used. The gap
widths of d = 0.5 and 1 mm then correspond to dimen-
sionless gap widths L = 18 and 36. For γ, we used the
value 0.08 determined from experimental Paschen curves
in [11]. It should be noted that our classical model pre-
dicts that the Paschen curves (i.e., the breakdown volt-
age U of the gas discharge as a function of pressure times
gap width pd) for diﬀerent system sizes should be indis-
tinguishable.
In practice, they do not precisely fall on
top of each other.

voltage has only one minimum as function of current j
and this occurs for a value j 6= 0. This subcritical be-
havior corresponds to the classical textbook case where
the characteristics bends down from the Townsend break-
down voltage towards a voltage minimum in the glow
discharge regime — as we have discussed in [27, 28] in
detail, this requires a suﬃciently large system size. For
γ = 0.08, the characteristics becomes subcritical for sys-
tem size L > Lcrit = e2 ln
= 19.2 while the
transition to supercritical behavior is determined numer-
(cid:2)
ically [27] to the value of L = 17.2.

(1 + γ)/γ

(cid:3)

Data on the coeﬃcient γ of secondary electron emis-
sion are relatively scarce, so it is quite common [31] to
use it as an adjustable parameter as we do. The tabu-
lated data for α0 = Ap and E0 = Bp from [30] together
with the Paschen curve for d = 0.5 mm from [11] would
suggest γ = 0.03, but that would mean that the char-
acteristics would be supercritical up to L = 24.9, then
it would develop some regime with negative diﬀerential
conductivity, and it would become subcritical only for
L > Lcrit(γ = 0.03) = 26.1.

We conclude that the gap with width 0.5 mm (cor-
responding to L = 18) is so sensitive to the not very
well known parameter γ that an analysis of the exper-
imental data would be rather uncertain. Furthermore,
the approximation of purely local interactions becomes
worse in shorter gaps. Finally, the electric ﬁelds in short
discharges are higher and vary more; therefore the as-
sumption that γ does not depend on E becomes more
restrictive. For this reason, we chose to analyze the sys-
tem with gap width 1 mm (L = 36).

We recall that the following intrinsic scales

X0 ≈ 27.78 µm ,

n0 ≈ 2.04 · 1012/cm3

t0 ≈ 40.6 · 10−12 s,
, E0 ≈ 10.26 kV/cm (27)

enter the dimensional analysis (16). Therefore the di-
mensionless parameters for a system with gap width of
d = 1 mm and applied voltages in the range from 500 to
740 V are in our simulations:

It is interesting to note how sensitive the theoretical
results are to small changes of the secondary emission co-
eﬃcient γ, in particular, for the short gap with L = 18.
This is illustrated in Fig. 1. The upper three solid lines
show the shape of the current voltage characteristics for
γ = 0.08 and gap widths of L = 17, 17.5 and 18. As dis-
cussed in more detail in [27, 28], the characteristics can
be supercritical (L = 17, positive diﬀerential conductiv-
ity for all values of the current j), mixed II (L = 17.5,
Townsend breakdown voltage lower than the local volt-
age minimum for j 6= 0) or mixed I (L = 18, Townsend
breakdown voltage higher than the local voltage mini-
mum for j 6= 0). The dashed line shows the characteris-
tics for L =18 and γ = 0.1. U then overall is considerably
lower and the characteristics is fully subcritical, i.e., the

µ = 0.0035 , L = 36 , γ = 0.08,
τs = 0.243 Rs , 3 · 105 ≤ Rs ≤ 3 · 106
17.5 ≤ Ut ≤ 26.

(28)

Here, the dimensionless capacitance of the semiconductor
layer is Cs = 0.243, and its dimensionless characteristic
time scale is τs = CsRs. The value Rs = 3 · 106 for the
semiconductor resistance corresponds to the dark con-
ductivity of σs = 3.2 · 10−8/(Ωcm), and Rs = 3 · 105
corresponds to the fully photo-activated conductivity
σs = 3.2 · 10−7/(Ωcm). The dimensionless voltage range
of 17.5 ≤ Ut ≤ 26 corresponds to the dimensional range
of 500 V ≤ Ut ≤ 740 V.

Equations (18)–(26) were solved numerically with an

of low current interrupted by a short current pulse. De-
pending on applied voltage Ut and resistance of the semi-
conductor layer Rs, either the homogeneous stationary or
the homogeneous oscillating state are dynamically sta-
ble. Inbetween, there is a regime of bistability where it
depends hysteretically on the previous state whether the
system is stationary or oscillating.

The same qualitative behavior can be observed in our
numerical solutions. First, the upper panel in Fig. 2
shows the current j(τ ) as a function of time for the sys-
tem with the parameters from (28) and Rs = 4 · 105 and
Ut = 19.5 (which corresponds to σs = 2.4 · 10−7/(Ωcm)
and Ut = 555 V). After some transient, the current
relaxes to periodic unharmonic oscillations. The lower
panel in Fig. 2 shows the voltage U(τ ) over the gas dis-
charge; the voltage on the semiconductor is correspond-
ingly Ut − U(τ ). In dimensional units, the peak current
of the oscillations is about 9 mA/cm2 and the frequency
is about 120 kHz.

The results presented in Figures 2 to 9 are derived on

a suﬃcient numerical accuracy.

C. Qualitative features of experimental and
numerical oscillations: hysteresis amd limit cycles

The experiments [10] show approximately periodic os-
cillations. They are quite anharmonic with long phases

The same numerical data for current j and voltage
U are shown as a phase space plot in Fig. 3. The ﬁg-
ure shows more precisely the approach to a limit cycle.
Fig. 3 contains two additional lines, namely the current
voltage characteristics of the gas discharge U = U(j) and
the load line U = Ut − Rsj. Their intersection marks the
stationary solution of the system. In the present case, it
is located in the low current regime close to the Townsend
limit, while the peak current explores the regime of sub-
normal glow.

The system of Figs. 2 and 3 is actually in the bistable
regime. For diﬀerent initial conditions that are a suﬃ-
ciently small perturbation of the stationary state, the
same system relaxes to the stationary point. This is
shown as phase space plot in Fig. 4.

of a system where the stationary solution is dynamically
unstable, and the system runs away from this initial state
and eventually reaches a limit cycle oscillation. This be-
havior is shown in Fig. 5 as j(τ ) and U(τ ), while Fig. 6
shows the corresponding phase space plot.

If the applied voltage Ut becomes large enough, the
stationary state becomes unstable for any initial condi-
tion. The search for appropriate parameters was guided
by the stability analysis described in sections IV and V
of this paper. We ﬁnd that Ut = 24 (Ut = 684 V) with all
other parameters unchanged can be used as an example

D. Quantitative comparison: amplitude and
frequency of oscillations

The qualitative agreement of numerical solutions and
experiment now encourages a more quantitative compar-
ison. The thesis [11] contains diagrams on how frequency
and maximal current amplitude depend on the semicon-
ductor conductivity for a gas gap of 1 mm. It also con-
tains the remark that frequency and amplitude for ﬁxed
conductivity depend in about the same way on the ap-
plied voltage as in the 0.5 mm gap of Ref. [10].

The same diagrams can also be derived from the nu-
merically obtained limit cycle oscillations, they are pre-
sented in Fig. 7. The ﬁgure shows the current amplitude
A and frequency f as a function of semiconductor con-
ductance 1/Rs for ﬁxed voltage Ut or as a function of Ut
for ﬁxed 1/Rs.

FIG. 7: Amplitude A and frequency f of the current oscilla-
tions as a function of applied total voltage Ut (for ﬁxed resis-
tance Rs = 4 · 105) and as a function of conductivity 1/Rs
(for ﬁxed voltage Ut = 21).

We now compare the results. The upper left panel
shows that the maximal current amplitude A as a func-
tion of applied voltage Ut is increasing with decreasing
slope. This agrees with the statements written in [11].
The upper right panel shows that the frequency f is an
almost linearly increasing function of applied voltage Ut,
this is actually in contradiction with the statement in [11]
that the function would decrease.

The lower two panels allow a more quantitative com-
parison since corresponding experimental diagrams can
be found in [11]. The experiments explore the range of
0.6 · 10−7/(Ωcm) ≤ σs ≤ 2.8 · 10−7/(Ωcm) which corre-
sponds to 0.62·10−6 ≤ 1/Rs ≤ 2.9·10−6. The experimen-
tal diagrams for Ut = 605 V and 616 V in [11] show, that
the amplitude A is very sensitive to this change while the

7

frequency f is rather robust. The numerical results are
derived for Ut = 21 which corresponds to Ut = 600 V.

In detail, the experimental curve for the current am-
plitude for 605 V shows ﬁrst an increase from 0.2 to 0.8
mA with a subsequent sudden drop to essentially 0 from
which the current suddenly jumps to values from 1.0 to
1.5 mA. For 616 V, in contrast, an almost continuous
increase from 0.2 to 2.7 mA is observed for the same
resistance range. Not too suprisinngly, our numerical re-
sults reproduce neither of these widely diﬀering results
at quite similar voltage. Rather, we observe an almost
constant value in the range of 5.5 · 10−4 to 6.0 · 10−4 in
the lower left pannel.

On the other hand, for the variation of the frequency
f with conductivity, experiments [11] both for 605 V and
for 616 V observe an about linear increase from 115 kHz
or 125 kHz to 220 kHz (4.6 · 10−6 ≤ f ≤ 8.8 · 10−6 in
our dimensionless units) in the range of 0.62 · 10−6 ≤
1/Rs ≤ 2.9 · 10−6. Our numerical results in this range
of 1/Rs show the same linear increase, from 1.5 · 10−6
to 6.5 · 10−6. We believe that this agreement is quite
convincing, in particular, since no parameter ﬁtting was
tried.

Summarizing, we ﬁnd convincing agreement with ex-
periment for A as function of Ut as well as for f as a
function of 1/Rs. For the last, the available experimen-
tal results allow to identify an almost quantitative agree-
ment. The sensitivity of the experimental results on A as
a function of 1/Rs does not allow quantitative compari-
son, and our results for f as a function of Ut deviate in
their functional form from the available statements about
experimental results.

E. Mechanism of the oscillations, reaction-diﬀusion
models and surface charge

The voltage proﬁles U(τ ) in Figs. 2 and 5 show that

there are two processes involved in the oscillations.

The ﬁrst process occurs on the slow time scale τs of the
semiconductor. It describes the exponential decay of the
voltage Ut − U(τ ) − Rsj ∝ e−τ /τs over the semiconductor
layer according to Eq. (23), as long as the contribution
of Rsj does not vary substantially. The decay time τs is
the Maxwell time due to resistance and capacitance of the
semiconductor layer. τs accounts for the slow rise of the
voltage U(τ ) over the gas discharge layer to a value above
the current voltage characteristics of the gas discharge.
The other process is the electric breakdown of the gas
discharge layer for suﬃciently large U(τ ) which leads to
a current pulse and a rapid subsequent decay of U(τ ).

It has been suggested by a number of authors [7, 15,
17, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] that the current could be ap-
proximated by a similarly simple equation of the type
∂τ j = g(U, j), where g vanishes on the current-voltage-
characteristics. This would bring the equations into a
reaction diﬀusion form. However, as we already have dis-
cussed in [12], such an approximation of the underlying

equations (18)–(21), (25) and (26) is not possible, since
it would not admit the period doubling events observed
in [12], and it would not allow the phase space plots in
Figs. 3, 4 and 6 to intersect the characteristics with a
nonvanishing derivative, as they deﬁnitely do.

The physical reason for this behavior is the ﬁnite re-
sponse time of the gas discharge layer, its “inertia” which
doesn’t allow an instantaneous reaction of the current. If
ions are created by bulk impact ionization close to the
anode, they will cross the whole gap until they reach
the cathode and possibly liberate more electrons by sec-
ondary emission. The time that the ions need to cross
the gap, is therefore an important scale of internal mem-
ory of the gas discharge.
It can be approximated as
τion ≈ L/(µ E) ≈ L2/(µ U(τ )) where |E| is some aver-
age ﬁeld within the gas gap. For the gap of L = 36
(d = 1 mm), the ion crossing time is estimated as 2.6·104
for U(τ ) = 14 or as 1.5 · 104 for U(τ ) = 24 (which corre-
sponds to 0.6 or 1 µs in dimensional units). This time is
of the same order or larger than the duration of a current
pulse, both in our numerical solutions and in the experi-
mental results of Fig. 5 in [10]. (For the experiments on
the 0.5 mm gap of Fig. 4 in [10], the situation seems to
be diﬀerent.)

Finally, it has been suggested in [38] that the surface
charge on the interface between gas and semiconductor
could play an important role, in a similar way as in AC
discharges. This is certainly true, but the surface charge
q(τ ) is not an independent variable. Rather it is fully
determined by the solution discussed above through

q(τ ) = ǫs

− E(L, τ ).

(35)

Ut − U(τ )
L

The assumption that this surface charge is the only rel-
evant charge in the whole system doesn’t lead to a sat-
isfactory description either, but the space charges in the
gas discharge layer have to be taken into account, too.

IV. STABILITY ANALYSIS: METHOD

The direct numerical solution of the dynamical prob-
lem is a time consuming procedure, that does not allow
the exploration of a wide set of parameter values. We
therefore have developed a linear stability analysis of the

state is dynamically unstable and how small perturba-
tions of such a state grow.
In the present section, we
present the method, and in the following one the results.

A. Problem setting and stationary solutions

The dynamical equations from section II.C are sum-

marized as

∂τ E(L, τ ) = j(τ ) −

φ(L, τ ) = −U(τ ) , φ(0, τ ) = 0.

The stationary solutions form the starting point of the

perturbation analysis. They solve the equations

∂zje0 = −je0 α(E0),
µE0 ∂zE0 = j0 − (1 + µ)je0,

∂zφ0 = −E0,

U0 = Ut − Rsj0

with boundary conditions

je0(0) = j0

,

je0(L) = j0,

1 + γ
γ

φ0(0) = 0

, φ0(L) = −U0.

Eqs. (43)–(45) with (47) and (48) deﬁne the current volt-
age characteristics U = U(j) of a stationary discharge
in the regime between Townsend and glow discharge
[27, 28, 30]. Eq. (46) is the load line due to the external
circuit. The intersection of load line and characteristics
deﬁnes a generically discrete number of stationary solu-
tions of the system as a whole.

B. Linear perturbations

For linear perturbations about this stationary state,

we use the ansatz

je(z, τ ) = je0(z) + je1(z) eλτ ,
E(z, τ ) = E0(z) + E1(z) eλτ ,
φ(z, τ ) = φ0(z) + φ1(z) eλτ ,

j(τ ) = j0 + j1 eλτ .

(49)
(50)
(51)
(52)

The lower index 0 denotes the unperturbed stationary so-
lutions while the lower index 1 denotes the linear pertur-
bations about this stationary solution. The factorization
of the perturbation into a z dependent function times the
exponential esτ anticipates the eigenvalue problem of the
solution.

In terms of the original variables, the explicit expan-
sion in ﬁrst order perturbation theory is a lengthy ex-
pression, but in terms of the variables

∂τ σ = ∂zje + jeα(E) ,
je = σE,
∂τ E = j(τ ) − (1 + µ)je − µE∂zE,

The general solution ~v(z) of (62) is therefore a superposi-

(68)

where j1,1(L) = 1 = j1,2(L), since these components have
this value at z = 0 according to (65): j1,1(0) = 1 =
j1,2(0), and since the equation of motion for j1 is ∂zj1 =
0. A nontrivial solution of both (67) and (68) requires
the determinant

for the eigenvalue λ.

C. Rescaling with µ and numerical calculation

The eigenvalue λ can now be calculated numerically.
First, it should be noted, that the equation of motion
(62) has matrix elements of very diﬀerent size, since µ is
a very small parameter. However, this apparent stiﬀness
of the problem can be removed by introducing the new
parameters

ιe =

ι =

, rs = Rsµ,

(70)

.

¯τs = τsµ , s =

The introduction of rescaled current density and time
scale and resistivity has a direct physical motivation.
Previous analysis of the stationary solutions [27, 28, 30]
as well as the dynamical solutions of Section III and [12]
show that velocities should actually be measured on the
time scale of the ions and not of the electrons. So the time
scale should be measured in units of t+ = 1/(α0µ+E0) =
t0/µ rather than in units of t0 = 1/(α0µeE0). The rescal-
ing (70) directly follows from this consideration.

Now the eigenvalue s can be calculated numerically as
follows: First an initial estimate s0 is chosen. Then the
two initial conditions (65) at z = 0 are integrated nu-
merically with (62) up to z = L. Generically, the deter-
minant ∆ (69) will then be non-vanishing. The request
that the determinant does vanish, ﬁxes a new value for
s that is used for the next step of the iteration within
an under-relaxation method that garantuees the stabil-
ity of the convergence. This procedure is repeated until
an accuracy of

sk+1 − sk

is reached.

The eigenvalue s is in general a complex parameter
whose real part describes the growth or decay of the os-
cillation amplitude while its imaginary part describes the
oscillation frequency. Since s is a parameter in the equa-
tion of motion (62), also the vector ~v(z) has complex
entries. Therefore 16 real functions Re h1(z), Im h1(z)
etc. have to be integrated over z.
It is convenient to
also integrate the two real functions je0 and E0 that en-
ter the matrix (62) together with the perturbations. The
iteration program is written in fortran 90 with complex
variables. For the integration of equations, a 4th order
Runge-Kutta method is used. The number of grid points
used was 500, since 1000 or 2000 grid points give essen-
tially the same result.

V. STABILITY ANALYSIS: RESULTS

In the present section, the validity of the stability anal-
ysis results are conﬁrmed by comparison with numerical
solutions of the full dynamical problem. The stability
analysis is then used to determine the phase diagram for
the onset of oscillating solutions. These phase diagrams
are then compared with experimental results, again with
semi-quantitative agreement.

A. The structure of the results

The stability analysis determines not only the complex

eigenvalue λ, but also the whole linear correction

~v(z) = C1

~v1(z) −
(cid:20)

Rs + (1 + λτs) U1,2(L)
Rs + (1 + λτs) U1,1(L)

,

~v2(z)
(cid:21)

(72)

up to the arbitrary complex constant C1.

This ~v(z) determines the evolution of current and volt-
age in linear approximation about the stationary solution
(j0, U0):

j(τ ) = j0 + j1 eλτ + c.c.,
U(τ ) = U0 + U1 eλτ + c.c.,

where c.c. denotes the complex conjugate. The ratio be-
tween U1 and j1 is ﬁxed through the boundary condition
(61) to the value

U1 = −

= r eiα j1,

j1
(1 + λτs)/Rs
Rs
|1 + λτs|

where

r =

and

cos α = −

,

sin α =

1 + Re λτs
|1 + λτs|

Im λτs
|1 + λτs|

.

The ﬁnal result is

j(τ ) = j0 + c µ eRe λτ cos(Im λτ + α0) ,
(77)
U(τ ) = U0 − c r eRe λτ cos(Im λτ + α + α0) (78)

(73)
(74)

(75)

(76)

where amplitude c and absolute phase α0 reﬂect the arbi-
trary factor C1 in (72) and are adjustable while all other
parameters are ﬁxed.

10

B. Comparison with solutions of the full PDE’s

As a check of accuracy, these solutions are now ﬁrst
compared with numerical solutions of the full PDE prob-
lem.

For the set of parameters from Figs. 2, 3 and 4, the
stationary solution is (j0, U0) = (1.49 · 10−5, 13.583), and
the eigenvalue λ has the complex value λ = −2.913 ·
10−6 ± i 4.822 · 10−5. As τs = 340/µ and Rs = 1400/µ,
the ratio of current and voltage amplitude r = 295/µ
and the phase shift α = 98.69o are determined through
Eq. (76).

The comparison of these predictions from the stability
analysis with numerical solutions of the full PDE problem
are shown in Fig. 8. Here the free parameters for the total
amplitude c and the absolute phase α0 were chosen such
as to ﬁt the PDE-data well.

This visual agreement can be tested in more detail. In
particular, we used the PDE-data in the time interval
5 · 105 < τ < 6.5 · 105 to determine the phase shift α
between U1 and j1. It is α = (100 ± 0.4)o, convincingly
close to the predicted value of α = 98.69o.

Increasing the total applied voltage Ut, the real part
of the eigenvalue λ grows until
it becomes positive.
This means that the stationary solution becomes lin-
early unstable and perturbations will grow. An ex-
ample of such behavior occurs for Ut = 24 with all
other parameters as before. The stationary solution is

then (j0, U0) = (2.64 · 10−5, 13.441), the eigenvalue is

voltage amplitude is r = 192/µ and the phase shift is
α = 99.83o.

Fig. 9 shows again the comparison between these re-
sults and the numerical solutions of the full PDE’s.
Again, the agreement is very convincing.

ary solution is unstable.

Of course, the predictive power of linear stability anal-
ysis is limited to small perturbations with j1 ≪ j0 and
U1 ≪ U0. When the amplitude of the oscillation from
Fig. 6 increases further, nonlinear couplings set in and
the system ﬁnally reaches a limit cycle as shown in Fig. 7.

C. Calculation of phase diagrams

The stability analysis now allows one to derive the
bifurcation line where a homogeneous stationary state
looses its stability. Fig. 10 shows this bifurcation line
for the parameters (28) as a function of applied voltage
Ut and conductivity 1/Rs for three diﬀerent values of γ.
Besides the value γ = 0.08 used everywhere else in the
paper, also results for γ = 0.04 and 0.16 are shown to
illustrate the sensitivity of theoretical predictions to this
parameter. For Re λ < 0, the stationary state is linearly
stable, while for Re λ > 0, the system is always in the
oscillating state.

Comparison with the experimental phase diagram in
Fig. 11 for the gas gap with a corresponding width of
d = 1 mm [11, 39] shows qualitative and quantitative
correspondences, but also deviations. Experiments in the
1 mm gap for Ut < 585 V (Ut = 20.5) do not exhibit os-
cillations. The same holds theoretically for a secondary

emission coeﬃcient of 0.08 or smaller. In detail, experi-
ments show that the raising phase transition line initially
raises with positive slope then changes gradually to be-
ing almost parallel to the σs axis and then continues with
negative slope up to the maximal experimentally reached
σs.

For the low conductivity of the semiconductor layer,
the experiment shows another bifurcation line almost
parallel to the Ut axis at values of σs around 0.5 ·

10−7/(Ω cm).
In dimensionless units this corresponds
to a plateau at values of 1/Rs around 0.5 · 10−6. An
approach to such a plateau can also be seen in the cal-
culated phase diagram. However, the theoretical curve
crosses over continuously to this plateau, while the ex-
perimental curve seems to show the intersection of two
bifurcation lines with quite distinct slope. We have no
explanation for this deviation.

It is remarkable that the bifurcation theory also covers
the almost horizontal bifurcation line for small 1/Rs. An-
other explanation for this experimentally observed fea-
ture of the phase diagram would have been a breakdown
of the continuum approximation: the recovery phase of
the oscillation would have carried such a low current that
the discreteness of the electrons would have to be taken
into account.

Finally, it was observed experimentally [10, 11] that
increasing the system size L while keeping other condi-
tions unchanged, the frequency decreases and oscillations
set in at higher voltages. This agrees with our calculated
phase diagram in Fig. 11.
Indeed, for Ut < 22.5, the
homogeneous stationary state is stable for L = 72.

VI. CONCLUSION

12

We have analyzed the simplest model

for a one-
dimensional short gas discharge coupled to an external
circuit with resistor, capacitance and stationary voltage.
This analysis is directly applicable to experiments per-
formed in [10, 11].

We have presented fully numerical solutions as well as
a linear stability analysis of the stationary state of the
system which are in very good mutual agreement. The
numerical solutions reproduce experimental observations
of bistability and oscillations in a semi-quantitative man-
ner, though the model is minimal and no attempt of pa-
rameter ﬁtting has been made. The stability analysis
allows us to derive bifurcation diagrams in a simple man-
ner, they also agree overall with experimentally obtained
bifurcation diagrams.

It should be remarked that we have constrained the
analysis to the gap of 1 mm wide; the gap of 0.5 mm
is so sensitive to the actual value of secondary emission
γ that quantitative analysis based on a ﬁxed value of γ
seemed doubtful.

We have reproduced a number of experimental obser-
vations up to the dependence of oscillation amplitude on
applied potential and of the oscillation frequency on the
conductivity of the semiconductor layer, while discrep-
ancies of other observables will stay a subject of inves-
tigation. This opens up the way to investigate now the
spatial and spatio-temporal patterns in the next step.

An anomalous anisotropic light scattering which peaks
in the plane of light polarization, the “propeller eﬀect”
named by authors, was observed in glass pumped by in-
tense femtosecond laser radiation [1]. A quiver move-
ment of photoelectrons in the light ﬁeld was the key to
an explanation of the eﬀect. A blue emission pattern of a
propeller shape was attributed to a defect-related photo-
luminescence (PL) and explained by its scattering. The
emission follows the angular distribution of the photo-
electrons given by dσ

with materials,
This is a ﬁeld where some long-lasting controversies over
generation of white-light continuum (super-continuum
(SC)), self-focusing and dielectric breakdown (DB) mech-
anisms should be resolved. By this comment we intend
to draw attention to the phenomenon of bremsstrahlung
(German word for “braking radiation”), which escapes
proper consideration and can explain, for example, emis-
sion spectra of dielectric breakdown and the above men-
tioned “propeller eﬀect” [1]. In our judgement, the expla-
nation of the “propeller eﬀect” should take into account
bremsstrahlung, transmission function of a measurement
setup, and optical aberrations.

Once the optical excitation generates free electrons,
this not only changes the dielectric function, which is
usually considered in the SC and light-induced DB mech-
anisms from the point of view of nonlinear optics, but
also inherently causes the light emission due to the
bremsstrahlung.
In a plasma state, after the dielectric
breakdown, when free charges are available, the radiated
energy, W , per unit angular frequency, ω, in the nonrel-
ativistic case is given by: [2]

of bremsstrahlung is continuous and spreads from X-
rays-to-IR. For an external observer (on z-axis) its spec-
tral content depends on the bandgap of the host mate-
rial, defects’ absorption, PL, fractoluminescence, sonolu-
minescence, and a transmission function of a measure-
ment setup. Time resolved spectroscopy could, e.g., dis-
tinguish among those diﬀerent contributions. For an
isotropic photoelectron distribution in plasma the eqn. 1
deﬁnes an emission spectrum integrated over all solid an-
gles.

The actual polarization and angular dependence of the
radiation of quiver photoelectrons is deﬁned by R × (R ×
˙v) [2], here R is the vector from the charge to the ﬁeld
point (only a far-ﬁeld contribution is considered). Fig-
ure 1(b-c) qualitatively shows the acceleration projec-
tions in the quiver plane of photoelectron oscillating, e.g.,
along Ex. Obviously, there are considerable accelerations
in the perpendicular directions to the Ex for straight-line
and parabolic encounters. Bremsstrahlung due to the ˙vx
will be projected into the Ex ∝ RZ × (RZ × ˙vx), the
−→
quiver direction, for an observer on z-axis (
z is usually
a direction along the illumination/observation). Thus,
the xy-projection of bremsstrahlung exactly follows the
angular distibution of photoelectrons and explains the
“propeller eﬀect”.

Highly collimated, plasma-ﬁlled magnetic ﬂux tubes are frequently observed on galactic, stellar
and laboratory scales. We propose that a single, universal magnetohydrodynamic pumping process
explains why such collimated, plasma-ﬁlled magnetic ﬂux tubes are ubiquitous. Experimental evi-
dence from carefully diagnosed laboratory simulations of astrophysical jets conﬁrms this assertion
and is reported here. The magnetohydrodynamic process pumps plasma into a magnetic ﬂux tube
and the stagnation of the resulting ﬂow causes this ﬂux tube to become collimated.

The extreme collimation of astrophysical jets [1, 2, 3]
and the solar corona heating mechanism [4] are two seem-
ingly unrelated astrophysical mysteries, yet both involve
collimation of magnetic ﬂux tubes. Astrophysical obser-
vations [2, 3] and simulations [1, 5] indicate that bipo-
lar plasma outﬂows (jets) are natural [1, 6] features of
young stellar objects, black holes, active galactic nuclei
and even aspherical planetary nebula [7]. Although it
has long been presumed [8, 9] that astrophysical jets are
magnetohydrodynamically driven, the standard models
do not agree on a single collimation process. A similar
issue exists in solar physics: solar spicules [10], promi-
nences [11, 12] and coronal loops [13] are considered to
be plasma-ﬁlled ﬁlamentary magnetic ﬂux tubes; coro-
nal heating models [14, 15] then invoke magnetic recon-
nection and plasma ﬂow within such ﬁlamentary loops.
However, the models explain neither the origin of the
observed ﬂows nor the extreme collimation (ﬁlamentary
nature) of the observed structures.

We propose that the collimation of any, initially ﬂared,
current-carrying magnetic ﬂux tube is due to the fol-
lowing process [16]: a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
force resulting from the ﬂared current proﬁle drives ax-
ial plasma ﬂows along the ﬂux tube; the ﬂows convect
frozen-in magnetic ﬂux from strong magnetic ﬁeld re-
gions to weak magnetic ﬁeld regions; ﬂow stagnation then
piles up this embedded magnetic ﬂux, increasing the local
magnetic ﬁeld and collimating the ﬂux tube via the pinch
eﬀect. Thus, the ﬂux tube ﬁlls with ingested plasma and
simultaneously becomes collimated. This paper presents
direct experimental evidence for this process. We use
ultra-high-speed imaging and Doppler measurements of
the fast plasma ﬂows, combined with direct density mea-
surements before and after the ﬁlling of the ﬂux tube.

Our experimental setup [17] simulates magnetically-
driven astrophysical jets at the laboratory scale by im-
posing boundary conditions analogous to astrophysical
jet boundary conditions (Fig. 1): a disk (cathode) rep-
resenting a central object such as a star, is coaxial and
co-planar with an annulus (anode) representing an accre-
tion disk. A vacuum poloidal magnetic ﬁeld produced by
an external coil links these two electrodes, mimicking a
poloidal magnetic ﬁeld threading the accretion disk. A
radial electric ﬁeld applied across the gap between the

der legs’ merge on axis to form a central column jet which

disk and annulus drives poloidal current.

The nominal parameters of the lab experiment include
a plasma discharge duration ∼ 20 µs, poloidal magnetic
ﬁeld B ∼ 0.01 − 0.3 T, gun voltage Vgun ∼ 1 − 7 kV,
poloidal current I ∼ 50−200 kA, density ∼ 1020−22 m−3.
The Alfv´en speed is vA ∼ 105 m/s, and the ion gyroradius
is ∼ 0.5 mm, much smaller than the typical scale lengths
(L ∼ 1 − 50 cm). The plasma β ranges from ≪1 to
∼0.5, assuming a plasma temperature ∼ 10 eV, and the
Lundquist number S = τr/τA ∼ 103 − 105, depending
on the characteristic length used to deﬁne the resistive
time τr (estimated from classical Spitzer resistivity) and
the Alfv´en time τA. These dimensionless numbers are
comparable to numerical MHD simulations.

Just before breakdown, neutral gas is puﬀed into the
vessel from nozzles located on the disk and the annu-
lus. After breakdown, plasma arches form, analogous

to solar prominence loops [18]. These arches are dis-
tributed toroidally, reminiscent of spider legs, with each
‘leg’ linking a gas nozzle on the disk to a corresponding
nozzle on the annulus (Fig. 1, 4.0 µs and Fig. 2). These
magnetically-dominated plasma arches are initially ﬂared
(i.e.
their minor radius increases with distance along
their axis). Because the coil-produced poloidal vacuum
magnetic ﬁeld is weaker at the annulus than at the disk,
the outer footpoint diameter is initially 4-5 times that
of the inner footpoint. The eight legs quickly become
bright and highly collimated:
in 0.5 µs, as the legs ﬁll
up with plasma, the outer/inner footpoint diameter ratio
has been measured to reduce by a factor of 2 (Fig. 3), and
can approach unity to within < 20% (Fig. 4). The legs
later merge (Fig. 1, 5.5-7.5 µs) to form a single central
column (Fig. 1, 8.0 µs), which constitutes the axially-
expanding ‘astrophysical jet’ (Fig. 1, 8-10 µs). The cen-
tral column can eventually kink (Fig. 1, 10-11.5 µs) and
lead to spheromak formation [19]. The initial ﬂaring of
the spider legs is just the ﬂaring of the coil-imposed vac-
uum magnetic ﬁeld, a known analytic function [20].

Measurements shown in Fig. 5 indicate that the neu-
tral gas density existing at breakdown is totally inad-
equate to account for the plasma density measured in
the spider legs or the central column. The measurements
were taken with a custom-built fast ion gauge (FIG), with
a 2µs response time, absolutely calibrated with a stan-
dard commercial ion gauge. In situ measurements of the
gas cloud in front of the electrodes were ﬁtted numeri-
cally to obtain a complete 3D approximation of the gas
output from the nozzles. The numerical ﬁt assumed a
linear superposition of gas cones from each nozzle, each

with a pressure distribution having an axial exponential
drop and a radial Gaussian proﬁle. In particular, these
measurements indicate that prior to breakdown, the neu-
tral gas density at the location of a single spider leg is
∼ 1017 m−3 (Fig. 5), which is 3-4 orders of magnitude
less than the plasma density measured just a few µs later
(Fig. 6a). These time-resolved FIG measurements also
show that, consistent with the molecular thermal veloc-
ity of ∼ 1 km/s, the characteristic time-scale for neutral
density evolution is ∼ 10 ms, so the neutral gas distri-
bution is quasi-stationary during the < 50 µs plasma
discharge duration. For a plasma density 103 − 104 times
greater than the locally available supply of neutrals, sim-

ple pinching of the tube would require ∼30-100 fold de-
crease in radius. Only a 2-fold decrease is observed, so all
spider leg particles must be ingested from the gas valves
into the leg by MHD forces on µs time-scales.

To visualize this fast axial ﬂow, nitrogen was injected
from the cathode footpoints of the spider legs and neon
from the anode footpoints (Fig. 2). A narrowband inter-
ference ﬁlter (central wavelength 402 nm, Gaussian pass-
band 10 nm) isolated the nitrogen plasma for one camera
(Fig. 2d-f), while simultaneous, unﬁltered photographs
were obtained with a second camera (Fig. 2a-c). A re-
construction of the experimental geometry overlaid on
the images allows comparison of the dimensions of visible
legs with best-ﬁt vacuum magnetic ﬂux tube (Fig. 4d).
The photographs indicate a brightness propagating along
the axis of the spider-leg ﬂux tube, from the cathode end
to the anode end, on a 0.5 µs time-scale (Figs. 2 and 7).
This bright front propagation occurs > 1.5 µs after the
breakdown process has ended, demonstrating that it is
diﬀerent from streamer fronts [22] associated with break-
down mechanisms. The time scale rules out ion acoustic
velocities (8 km/s) from consideration and the ﬂow direc-
tion rules out electrostatic acceleration. The propagation
in fact resembles a magnetized vacuum arc discharge [23]
and involves nitrogen plasma ﬂow, with ∼ 102 km/s ve-
locities (Fig. 7) and a ∼ 1011 m/s2 mean acceleration.

to the square root of the light intensity, and integrating

where the stagnation velocity u(L) = 0 and L ∼ 18 cm is
the spider leg’s axial length (assumed to remain constant
during the measurements). The mean acceleration is es-
timated from the typical velocity and time-scale (u/t ∼
105/10−6 ∼ 1011 m/s2) or from the typical length-scale
of the ﬂow (duz/dt ∼ u2/(2z) ∼ 1010/(2 × 5 × 10−2) ∼
1011 m/s2).

According to the model [16], the axial component of
the MHD pumping force is maximised on the ﬂux tube
axis and accelerates plasma along this axis according to

where a is the local ﬂux tube radius (∂a/∂z is the ﬂaring),
I is the total current in the ﬂux tube, uz is the axial
plasma velocity and ρ is the plasma density.

Using spider-leg ﬂux tube dimensions measured from
the photographs (Fig. 4c, a ∼ 4 mm, ∂a/∂z ∼ 0.02)
and assuming the current inside a single leg is one
eighth the total measured 120 kA gun current, Eq.2 pre-
dicts a spider-leg plasma density of ∼ 2 × 1021 m−3.
This implies that within 0.5 µs, MHD forces inject
about 2 × 1016 nitrogen particles from the gas nozzles
into a ∼ 10 cm3 spider-leg. Summing over all eight
ﬂux tubes gives a total inﬂux pumping rate of ∼ 3 ×
1017 particles/µs. Since it takes ∼ 10 µs for the legs to
merge and form the 2.5 cm diameter, 50 cm long central
column, assuming the pumping rate is constant, the cen-
tral column should then have a ∼ 1 × 1022 m−3 volume-
averaged plasma density. The central column jet, located
where 10 µs previously there was essentially vacuum, has
ingested about 10% of the total number of particles avail-
able from the gas feed lines. At this rate, it would take a

process requires net electrical current, a supply of parti-
cles and stagnation of the driven ﬂow. In an astrophysical
context, accretion disks supply plasma and ﬂows stagnate
at the lobes; a net axial current is understood to be nec-
essary for self-conﬁnement [26] and recent observations
of helical magnetic ﬁeld structure in jets are indicative of
net axial current [27]. The electrical circuit is then closed
by radial currents in the accretion disk, returning via the
cocoon. Active solar regions also exhibit unneutralized
electrical currents [28]. We emphasize that strong ﬂows
and collimation can be driven by even modest amounts
of current, before reaching the kink instability (high cur-
rent) threshold. Supported by the US DoE and NSF.

few hundred µs to empty all the gas from the feed lines.
This time is much shorter than the time-scale of fusion
experiments, where similar ﬁlamentary ﬂux tubes have
been observed to emerge [24] explosively from the hot
plasma core and connect to the cold walls.

The prediction for very high plasma densities in the
spider legs and the central column has been substanti-
ated using independent spectroscopic line measurements
(Figs. 6a, 8). These measurements can exhibit large
Stark broadening indicative of high electron densities.
For hydrogen plasmas, we measure ∼ 2 × 1020 m−3 in
the spider-leg (Fig. 8a) and ∼ 2 × 1022 m−3 in the fully-
formed central column jet. In nitrogen discharges, central
column jet densities 8 × 1022 m−3 are measured (Fig. 6a
at 4 µs, Fig. 8b) however spider-leg densities cannot be
resolved. Spectral lines were sampled by optical ﬁbres
viewing selected portions of the discharge and recorded
with an optical multichannel analyzer. The FWHM g
[nm] is related to ne [m−3] by g = 1.6 × 10−24ne for NII
[21] and g = 2 × 10−15n
for H [25]. The measurements
are corrected for the instrument function and a 1-10 eV
thermal broadening, estimated from ion line ratios.

The pumping model also predicts that the largest
plasma ﬂow velocity in the tube is of the order of the
Alfv´en velocity associated with the magnetic ﬁeld gen-
erated by the axial current. Here, the 15 kA current,
4 × 1020−21 m−3 density and 4 mm typical radius of the
spider-leg gives vA ∼ 70 − 220 km/s, encompassing the
measured ∼ 100 km/s shown in Fig. 7. On the axis of a
single spider-leg (Fig. 6b), we observe blue shifts corre-
sponding to ∼ 20−40 km/s line-of-sight velocities. Using
CCD images, we estimate the optical probe to be 8 cm
along and 1 cm away from the spider-leg axis, with a line-
of-sight angle of 72◦±3◦to the plasma ﬂow direction. In
the central column jet, the ﬂow velocity is measured at
∼ 40 − 70 km/s (Fig. 8b), with a line-of-sight coincident
to the jet axis. These velocities are consistent with the
Alfv´en velocity expected from the measured total 150 kA
current and 7 × 1022 m−3 peak density in the central col-
umn. Both the collimation of the spider legs and the
central column jet arise from the same process.

The results thus provide strong evidence for ﬂow-
driven collimation of ﬂared magnetic ﬂux tubes. This

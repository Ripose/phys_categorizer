Abstract

One feature of passing relativistic electron through a single crystal is emission of parametric

X-ray radiation (PXR) due to diﬀraction on a crystallographic planes. As was shown in [1], PXR

and coherent bremsstrahlung (CBS) take place for non-relativistic (or slow relativistic) electrons

too. In this case emission spectrum consists of number of peaks corresponding to crystal reﬂexes

in background of incoherent bremsstrahlung. These peaks are distinguished only for thin crystals,

because the inﬂuence of electron multiple scattering on radiation increases with the crystal thickness

and, as a result, smoothes out peaks. Simulation of PXR and CBS emission and considering of

multiple scattering inﬂuence on spectra are carried out in present work. The optimal geometry

with suppressed inﬂuence of multiple scattering is considered. Optimal geometry corresponds to

the following condition

responding to the reﬂex under consideration. βu = u/c, where u is average velocity of electron

in beam , θ is the angle between velocity and wave vector of emitted photon. Optimal geometry

gives possibility to use more thick crystals for PXR generation. The dynamical shift of PXR peaks

which is one more feature of multiple scattering inﬂuence is predicted and discussed.

INTRODUCTION

PXR is the radiation from a charged particle due to the photon diﬀraction on the planes

of a single crystal. It was shown both theoretically and experimentally and citation therein)

that PXR from a relativistic electron (E

50 MeV) led to very high spectral intensity

within the narrow angular and spectral range (∆θ

∆ω/ω

≥

10−3).

∼

∼

Work [1] discussed and explained diﬀraction peaks produced experimentally in [2, 3, 4] for

non-relativistic electrons (E

50

100 keV) on the basis of interference between PXR and

∼

÷

CBS. But the non-relativistic electron beam passing through the crystal is under the strong

action of Coulomb multiple scattering. It action is so great that the electron beam becomes

completely isotropic after passing through the crystal with the thickness of order of several

microns. So, the PXR and CBS is lost in the background of incoherent bremsstrahlung. For

observation of PXR and CBS peaks the crystal must be suﬃciently thin (

0.1 µm).

∼

In the present paper inﬂuence of multiple scattering on PXR and CBS peaks is studied.

The features of PXR and CBS such as dynamical peak frequency shifts and kinematical

suppression of multiple scattering are derived and discussed.

spontaneous emission line width θs > 1/(kLe). As a result, emission line is widened and

spectral-angular brightness reduces. It is very desirable to decrease the inﬂuence of multiple

Here n is a unit vector having direction of wave vector. So, position of these peaks depends

on reciprocal vector g and on angle of photon observation. Therefore, spectral distribution

measured by detector at ﬁxed angle is looked as the set of peaks on the background of inco-

herent bremsstrahlung. The peaks position changes as with the observation angle change so

with crystal rotation. Therefore, emission spectrum is easy tuned. Due to multiple scattering

electron beam acquires velocity spread, which leads to frequency spread in correspondence

to expression (7). First term of (1) corresponding to PXR depends on polarizability χg.

shifts in region with larger frequency. This dynamical frequency shift will be demonstrated

in III.

Let us study frequency dependence of diﬀraction peaks on crystal rotation angles. Rota-

tion will be described by standard Euler angles α, β, γ between normal to the crystal surface

and velocity vector (which is parallel to Z axis). Here α changing in the range 0...2π is the

rotation angle relative to vector v, β changing in range 0...π is rotation angle relative to new
axis (1 0 0) and γ changing in the range 0...2π is the rotation angle relative to the new Z ′

axis. It is evident that peak frequency can’t depend on α because independence of scalar

product gv on α. Dependence of frequency on γ and β is shown on Figs. 1b and 2a.

It can be seen from ﬁgures that frequency changes in wide spectral range due to crystal

rotation. Frequency changes with change of observation angle also. This is shown on Fig.

2b. These ﬁgures of frequency dependence were built with the help of the formula

which follows from (7) if crystal surface coincides with crystallographic plane [0 0 1], βu =

v0/c. n1, n2, n3 are indices corresponding to concerned reﬂexes.

Very eﬀective demonstration of orientation dependence is splitting of reﬂexes frequencies.

For example, all reﬂexes of crystal [1 1 1] with same sum k + l + m are degenerated at zero

angle of crystal inclination. This degeneration is disappeared if we incline crystal on angle β.

Dependence of frequency on angle γ is shown on Figure 3. It is seen, that for the case when

crystal is not inclined, frequencies for all reﬂexes with k + l + m = 7 are the same and not

change. But when crystal is inclined on β = 3 degrees, reﬂexes split and their frequencies

depend on γ. Let’s note, that at diﬀerent values of angle γ we shall see diﬀerent number of

reﬂexes frequencies.

As was shown in (8) and (9), brightness has maximal magnitude at θg

is evident that change of one angle parameter changes other angular parameters of target

Figure 5 corresponds to electron current 1 µA and crystal thickness L

parameters is on the Figure It can be seen, that peak corresponding to optimal geometry is

very bright and it width is about of 0.05 KeV. For comparison the dependence of spectral-

angular brightness on frequency for non-optimal geometry is shown on Fig. 6. When the

beam takes dispersion, then electrons which emit smaller frequencies will give greater con-

tribution to emission due to increasing of polarizability at frequency reducing. So, peaks

will shift in more soft region. On Fig. 6 point shows central frequency of diﬀraction peak

without accounting of multiple scattering. Dynamical frequency shift corresponds to diﬀer-

ence between these frequency. Such behavior of peak central frequency should be observed

experimentally.

The brightness corresponding to optimal geometry (Fig. 5) exceeds in

100 times the

brightness for non-optimal one (Fig. 6).

ing. Combining kinematical suppression with inclined observation geometry it is possible to

produce very bright and narrow peak of PXR radiation.

IV. CONCLUSION

Regulation of multiple scattering action on PXR (CBS) emission by geometry choice gives

possibility using relatively thick crystals for observation of diﬀraction peaks. Speciﬁc reﬂex

and speciﬁc crystal orientation corresponds to speciﬁc observation angle and frequency where

kinematical suppression is appeard. Therefore, experimental setup should have possibility

of crystal target and detector orientation in wide spectral range.

Abstract

The theory of mean ﬁeld electrodynamics for diﬀusive processes in Electron

Magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) model is presented. In contrast to Magne-

tohydrodynamics (MHD) the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld here is governed by

a nonlinear equation in the magnetic ﬁeld variables. A detailed description of

diﬀusive processes in two dimensions are presented in this paper. In particu-

lar, it has been shown analytically that the turbulent magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusivity

is suppressed from naive quasilinear estimates. It is shown that for complete

whistlerization of the spectrum, the turbulent diﬀusivity vanishes. The ques-

tion of whistlerization of the turbulent spectrum is investigated numerically,

and a reasonable tendency towards whistlerization is observed. Numerical

studies also show the suppression of magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusivity in accordance

with the analytical estimates.

I. INTRODUCTION

The transport and ampliﬁcation properties of a large scale magnetic ﬁeld remains an

area of active investigation. This is primarily due to its relevance in a variety of physical

phenomena. For example, the existence of magnetic ﬁeld in the universe is being under-

stood on the basis of ampliﬁcation process by some kind of dynamo mechanism. Another

interesting phenomenon is the release of high energy bursts in solar ﬂares etc. It is believed

to occur as a result of the reconnection of magnetic ﬁelds, which can happen in the pres-

ence of ﬁnite diﬀusivity. However, there is only modest quantitative understanding of these

processes. The amount of magnetic energy released by reconnection depends on the value

of diﬀusivity, which turns out to be too small to provide an explanation of the vast energy

released in these bursts. There have been attempts then to understand these phenomenon

on the basis of turbulent magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusivity, which is directly related to the question

of transport of a large scale magnetic ﬁeld in the presence of turbulence. Most theories put

forward in these areas are cast within the Magnetohydrodynamic system. Lately, however,

there has been some work which make use of models pertaining to faster time scales. It is

on this regime that we are going to focus here.

In the present work we address the question of the diﬀusion of a long scale magnetic

ﬁeld in the presence of small scale turbulent magnetic ﬂuctuation ocurring at time scales

which are faster than the ion response time. For such phenomena the evolution of magnetic

ﬁeld is governed by the electron ﬂow velocity. The ions being stationary, the ﬂow velocity

of the electrons determines the current and hence is thus directly related to the curl of

magnetic ﬁeld. Thus unlike MHD, in this approximation, heretofore referred as the Electron

Magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) approximation, the magnetic ﬁeld itself evolves through an

explicitly nonlinear equation. This should be contrasted to the MHD model in which the

nonlinear eﬀects creep indirectly through the lorentz force operating on the plasma ﬂow.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II we present the salient features of the

Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) model.

In section III we study the evolution

2

of mean magnetic ﬁeld in two dimensions within the framework of EMHD description. In

two dimensions there is no ampliﬁcation of the large scale ﬁeld, it can only diﬀuse. We

obtain an expression for the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient and show that it is suppressed

from the naive quasilinear estimates. For complete whistlerization, i.e. when the turbulence

is comprised only of randomly interacting whistler waves (whistler modes being the normal

modes of the EMHD model), we show that there is no turbulent contribution to diﬀusivity.

This, then raises the pertinent question about the constituents of the turbulent state in

this particular model. It becomes important to know whether the turbulent state comprises

entirely of randomly interacting whistler waves or is it merely a collection of random eddies

or is it that a combination of both whistlers and eddies which represent the true scenario?

We address these question in section IV by numerically simulating the decaying turbulence

for EMHD equations. The initial condition is chosen to be random, i.e. no whistlers to

begin with. The study of ﬁnal state reveals evidence of whistlerization. In section V we

numerically investigate the problem of diﬀusion, which shows suppression of magnetic ﬁeld

diﬀusivity, essentially conﬁrming our analytical ﬁndings of section III. Section VI contains

the discussion and conclusion.

II. THE MODEL

Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) is the theory of the motion of magnetized

electron ﬂuid in the presence of self consistent and external electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Such

a theory is applicable when the time scales of interest are fast (e.g. lying between electron

and ion gyrofrequencies) so that ions being massive and unmagnetized play a passive role

as a neutralizing background, and the dominant role in dynamics is played by a strongly

magnetized electron species. Phenomena having such time scales are often encountered in

a number of plasma operated devices (e.g. switches, focusing devices, fast Z-pinches etc.

[1]). Moreover, in the description of collisionless magnetic reconnection [2] as well as in

certain problems related to ionosphere, the EMHD paradigm is invoked frequently. The

3

entire whistler physics is premised on the EMHD regime of dynamics.

The EMHD model is obtained by using the (i) electron momentum equation (ii) the

current expressed in terms of electron velocity ~J = −neeve as the ions are stationary at fast

time scales depicted by the model; and (iii) the Ampere’s law, where displacement current

is ignored under the assumption (ω << ω2

pe/ωce). The magnetic ﬁeld then evolves through

the following equation

∂
∂t

(∇ × ~P ) = ∇ × ( ~ve × (∇ × ~P )) − meν∇ × ~ve

(1)

Here me and ~ve are the electron mass and the velocity respectively, ~P is the canonical

momenta deﬁned as ~P = me ~ve − e ~A/c ( ~A being the vector potential of the magnetic ﬁeld),

ν represents the electron ion collision frequency. Using the current and electron velocity

relationship we obtain ∇ × ~P = e(d2

It is clear from Eq.1 that the (d2

e∇2 ~B − ~B)/c; where de = c/ωpe is the skin depth.
e∇2 ~B − ~B) is frozen in the electron ﬂuid ﬂow.

In

the limit when the electron inertia can be ignored, it is simply the magnetic ﬁeld which

is carried along with the electron ﬂuid. Since ve ∼ −∇ × ~B; the evolution equation for

magnetic ﬁeld is nonlinear in ~B. This can be contrasted with the MHD model where the

magnetic ﬁeld evolution is governed by an equation which is intrinsically linear in ~B. In

MHD, the nonlinear eﬀects then arise as a result of back reaction on the ﬂuid ﬂow through

the Lorentz force terms. Basically, in EMHD ~ve ∼ −∇ × ~B, and so the ﬂow is directly

related to the instantaneous magnetic ﬁeld; whereas in MHD the evolution of ﬂow velocity

~v depends on magnetic ﬁeld through the Lorentz force term and hence ~v has a memory of

the past magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. The MHD model is applicable for scale lengths which

are longer than the ion skin depth. EMHD on the other hand depicts phenomenon having

scale lengths shorter than the ion skin depth. Another distinction from MHD arises from

the presence of intrinsic scale, viz. the electron skin depth de = c/ωpe in the EMHD model,

which separates the two regimes one in which electron inertia is important and the other

where the electron inertia plays no role. The character of the EMHD equation changes in

these two disparate regimes of scale lengths.

4

In two dimensions (i.e. when the variations are conﬁned in x − y plane) Eq.1 can be

simpliﬁed and cast in terms of two scalar variables ψ and b which deﬁne the total magnetic

ﬁeld by the expression ~B = ˆz × ∇ψ + bˆz. The following coupled set then represents the

evolution of these scalar variables

∂
∂t

∂
∂t

(ψ − ∇2ψ) + ˆz × ∇b · ∇(ψ − ∇2ψ) = η∇2ψ

(b − ∇2b) − ˆz × ∇b · ∇∇2b + ˆz × ∇ψ · ∇∇2ψ = η∇2b

(2)

(3)

Here we have chosen to normalize length by electron skin depth de = c/ωpe, magnetic ﬁeld

by a typical amplitude B0 and time by the corresponding electron gyrofrequency. In the

nonresistive limit the above coupled equations support the following quadratic invariants

E =

[(∇ψ)2 + b2 + (∇2ψ)2 + (∇b)2]dxdy

which represents the total energy (sum of the magnetic and the kinetic energy),

the mean square magnetic potential and

H =

(ψ − ∇2ψ)2dxdy

Z

K =

(ψ − ∇2ψ)(b − ∇2b)dxdy

Z

the cross helicity. The ﬁelds b and ψ are chosen to be uncorrelated initially in our numerical

simulations. On the basis of the existence of these quadratic invariants it can be infered

that the mean square magnetic potential cascades towards longer scale. We will be making

use of this later in our derivation for turbulent diﬀusivity.

Linearizing the evolution equations in the presence of uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0 pointing

in the y direction leads to the following dispersion relation

for whistlers, the normal mode of oscillations in the EMHD regime. It is clear form the dis-

persion relation that the propagation of these waves is preferentially parallel to the magnetic

ﬁeld. Furthermore, the whistler wave excitation leads to the coupling of the form bk = ±kψk

between the two perturbed ﬁelds. This relation between the perturbed ﬁelds then leads to

an equipartition between the energy associated with the poloidal and the axial ﬁelds. An

initial unequal distribution of energy in the poloidal and axial ﬁelds ultimately has a ten-

dency towards redistribution and achieving equipartition as a result of the whistlerization of

the spectrum. It is observed that time asymptotically the turbulent state in EMHD consists

of a gas of whistlers interspersed with a collection of random eddies.

There has been considerable interest lately to understand features of EMHD turbulence

both in two and three dimensions in terms of power spectra and the cascade properties of the

square invariants supported by the model [3]. Our attempt here, however, is to understand

the role of EMHD turbulence in determining the diﬀusion of long scale magnetic ﬁeld.

III. SUPPRESSION OF TURBULENT MAGNETIC DIFFUSIVITY IN 2D

In this section we concentrate on the transport of magnetic ﬁeld in two dimension. In

2D the magnetic ﬁeld can only diﬀuse, thus our endeavour here is to estimate the eﬀective

magnetic diﬀusivity in the presence of turbulence.

We will concentrate here on turbulent scale lengths longer than the electron skin depth.

In this regime of scale lengths i.e. for kde << 1 the electron inertia eﬀects are unimportant

and as mentioned in earlier section the magnetic ﬁeld lines are frozen in the electron ﬂuid

ﬂow. Thus turbulence in the electron velocity leads to the diﬀusion of magnetic ﬂux. This

diﬀusion of magnetic ﬁeld lines, arising as a result of turbulence and not due to resistivity, is

termed as the turbulent diﬀusivity of the magnetic ﬁeld. The eﬀective turbulent diﬀusivity

would thus depend on the electron ﬂuid ﬂow velocity. A naive quasilinear estimate would

thus predict that the magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusivity β ∼ τ v2

e ∼ τ (∇b)2, where τ is some averaged

correlation time for the electron ﬂow velocity ve = ˆz × ∇b in the x − y plane, and b is the

z component of the turbulent small scale magnetic ﬁeld. This suggests that the magnetic

ﬁeld diﬀusion in the x − y plane is solely determined by the turbulent properties of the

6

z (i.e. the axial) component of the magnetic ﬁeld. However, this does not represent the

complete picture. We will now show that the presence of small scale turbulence in the

poloidal magnetic ﬁeld results in the suppression of such estimates of diﬀusivity. This is

similar to the work carried out by Gruzinov [4], Cattaneo [5] and others in the context of

MHD. In MHD the magnetic ﬁeld lines are tied to the plasma ﬂow velocity. It is observed

that the magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusivity is suppressed from the quasilinear estimates given solely in

terms of plasma ﬂow velocity. The presence of small scale turbulence in the magnetic ﬁeld,

which opposes the ﬂuid motion through the ~J × ~B backreaction is found to be responsible

for such a suppression.

We choose to represent the small scale turbulence in the ﬁelds b and ψ as

b(x, t) =

bk(t)exp(i~k · ~r)

ψ(x, t) =

ψk(t)exp(i~k · ~r)

Xk

Xk

ψ0 = ψqexp(iqxx) + c.c

In addition to this we assume the existence of a large scale magnetic ﬁeld pointing along y

direction characterized by the magnetic stream function of the following form

This magnetic ﬁeld has a scale length q−1 >> k−1 and hence when considering averaging

over the scale of turbulence this ﬁeld can be essentially treated as a constant in space. We

are interested in understanding the process of diﬀusion of this long scale ﬁeld in the presence

of small scale turbulence in the variables b and ψ, i.e. we seek an equation of the kind

and are interested in determining β in terms of the properties of small scale turbulence. The

qth fourier component of Eq.2 yields

Γx =< −

where k1 = q − k.

To estimate the correlation < bkψk1 > we make use of the quasilinear approximation

where each of these ﬁelds gets generated from the other through the interaction with the

large scale ﬁeld. Thus we can write

< bkψk1 >=< bkδψk1 > + < δbkψk1 >,

where it is understood that δψk1 is the magnetic perturbation in the plane arising as the

result of turbulent stretching of the mean magnetic ﬁeld by the electron ﬂow velocity ˆz ×~kbk;

and δbk is the perturbation in the elecron ﬂow (viz.ˆz × ~kδbk) arising from the Lorentz force

ˆzk2

1ψk1 × ˆyqxψq. It should be noted here that the ﬁrst term corresponds to that derived from

a kinematic treatment, wherein the response of magnetic ﬁeld on ﬂow is not considered. The

second term takes account of the back reaction of the magnetic ﬁeld on the electron velocity.

Thus dropping the second term would be tantamount to a purely kinematic approximation.

We will now show that the second term leads to a signiﬁcant suppression of the estimates of

diﬀusivity obtained purely from the kinematic treatment. The equations for δbk and δψk1

are

The factor inside the square bracket in the right hand side of the above equation represents

the turbulent contribution to diﬀusivity. It is made up of two parts. The ﬁrst part, depending

on k2

y | bk |2 represents the kinematic contribution and the second part arises as the result

of small scale turbulence in the poloidal component of magnetic ﬁeld.

It is clear that

turbulence in the poloidal component of magnetic ﬁeld contributes towards suppressing

the magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusivity.

It should be noted here that for complete whistlerization,

the spectral components of the two ﬁelds would be related as bk = ±kψk, for which the

turbulent diﬀusivity vanishes exactly. For this extreme case, diﬀusion of ψq is determined

by resistivity alone. It appears then, that the understanding of the question of whistlerization

of the spectrum in the turbulent state is of paramount importance. We will study this issue

in the next section.

The kinematic diﬀusivity β0 would be just β0 =

times (i.e. assume τk = τ for each mode ) and write β = β0 − τ < k2 >< (∇ψ)2 > /2. To

estimate < (∇ψ)2 > we use the stationarity of the mean square magnetic potential. This

can be justiﬁed on the basis of inverse cascade property of the mean square potential. At

longer scales dissipation due to resistivity is small and the assumption of stationarity of

the mean square potential is reasonably good. We multiply Eq.2 by ψ and take ensemble

average. This yields

we thus obtain

Here Rm is the magnetic Reynold’s number. It is clear that for Rm >> 1 the suppression

of the magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusivity occurs even when the turbulent velocity is larger than the

eﬀective whistler speed in the presence of B0, the magnetic ﬁeld.

We have observed in the earlier section that for a turbulent state which is a collection

of whistlers alone, the eﬀective turbulent diﬀusivity goes to zero. Thus it is of signiﬁcance

IV. WHISTLERIZATION

10

to understand the whistlerization of turbulent spectra. This is identical to studying the

question of Alfvenization in the context of MHD model. It is interesting to note, however,

that in the MHD model Alfvenization leads to an equipartition between the magnetic and

the ﬂuid energies. However, there can be no equipartition between the magnetic and kinetic

energies as a result of the whistlerization of the spectrum. Thus, the dominance of magnetic

or kinetic energies is dependent on whether the typical scale of turbulence are longer or

shorter that the electron skin depth respectively. In this paper we have concentrated on the

case where the turbulent scales are much longer compared to the electron skin depth. Thus

the total energy is predominantly magnetic. Whistlerization of the spectrum then leads to

an equipartition between the poloidal and the axial ﬁeld energies.

We seek to understand the question of whistlerization by carrying out numerical simula-

tion. We evolve the two ﬁeld ψ and b by Eq.2 and Eq.3 respectively, using a fully de-aliased

pseudospectral scheme. In this scheme the ﬁelds b and ψ are fourier decomposed. Each of

the fourier modes are then evolved, linear part exactly, whereas the nonlinear terms are cal-

culated in real space and then fourier transformed in k space. This requires going back and

forth in real and k space at each time step. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) routines were

used to go back and forth in the real and k space at each time integration. The time stepping

is done using predictor corrector with the mid point leap frog scheme. The simulation was

carried out with a resolution of 128X128 modes as well as at a higher resolution of 256X256

modes. The initial spectrum of the two ﬁelds b and ψ was chosen to be concentrated on a

band of scales and their phases were taken to be random. The two ﬁelds were chosen to be

entirely uncorrelated to begin with.

In Fig.1 we show a plot | bk | vs. | kψk | for the initial spectrum. It is clear from the ﬁgure

that the initial spectrum is totally diﬀerent from a spectrum whistler waves, which in turn

would have shown up in the ﬁgure as a straight line passing through the origin with unit

slope basically depicting the relationship | bk |=| kψk | for whistlers. In Fig.2 and Fig.3 we

plot for the evolved spectrum | bk | vs. | kψk | for B0 = 0 and 0.5 respectively. It is clear that

most of the points now cluster close to the origin. It is suggestive, when contrasted with the

11

initial condition of Fig.1 that the modes are trying to acquire whistler wave relationship. The

scatter in the plot indicates that both eddies and whistlers constitute the ﬁnal state. Thus

a quantitative assessment of the turbulent state as regards whistlerization of the spectra is

required. For this purpose we introduce a variable

wk =

abs(| bk |2 − | ψk |2)
(| bk |2 + | ψk |2)

(10)

which essentially indicates the fractional deviation of the kth mode from being whistlerized.

In Table I we list the fraction of modes in the spectrum for which wk is within certain

percentage.

It is clear from Table I that the initial state had zero fraction of modes having deviations,

wk even upto 10%, in the ﬁnal state a reasonable fraction of modes acquire whistlerization

within a certain percentage of deviation as measured by the parameter wk. We also introduce

an integral quantity signifying overall whislerization as w =

wkdk/

dk. For a completely

whistlerized spectrum the variable w would take a value of 0, and the maximum value that

R

R

w can have is unity. For our initial spectrum w = 0.9957, after evolution (i)for B0 = 0

(corresponding to Fig.1), w = 0.5020, and (ii) for B0 = 0.5 (Fig.2) w = 0.4912. More

detailed studies of this kind, addressing the evolution of whislerization with time (e.g. by

studing how w evolves with time), its dependence on external magnetic ﬁeld, etc. are being

carried out presently and will be presented in a subsequent publication. The question of

12

Alfvenization of the spectrum in the context of MHD is also being pursued along similar

lines and will be presented elsewhere.

It is clear from our studies that the whistlerization of the spectrum is not complete.

Random eddies are also present in the evolved spectrum. This deviation from the whistler

wave relationship contributes towards the residual eﬀective turbulent diﬀusivity of the mag-

netic ﬁeld lines. In the next section we will carry out a numerical study to determine the

diﬀusivity of magnetic ﬁeld in the presence of turbulence.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS ON DIFFUSION

We saw in section III that the ﬁnal expression of the eﬀective diﬀusivity that we ob-

tained was based on the fact that the eﬀective correlation times of the interacting modes

were ultimately the same for each of them. Whether this this really happens can only be

veriﬁed by a fully nonlinear numerical simulation. We have carried out a set of numerical

studies to investigate the question of magnetic diﬀusivity. We observe that the results of our

investigation agrees with the expression that we have obtained earlier, thereby suggesting

that the ansatz of local equivalence of correlation time is indeed correct.

The numerical scheme is the same as outlined in the last section. However, in addition

to evolving the two ﬁelds b and ψ a number of tracer particles (N = 1600) were placed in

the two dimensional spatial x − y region of integration. The particles were initially placed

uniformly in the x − y plane, and were then evolved using the Lagrangian electron velocity

at their location (viz. ˆz × ∇b). Since the magnetic ﬁeld lines are tied to the electron ﬂow

velocity, the behaviour of magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusivity can be discerned from the diﬀusion of

these particles. Thus the averaged mean square displacement of these particles is used as

a measure of magnetic diﬀusivity (e.g. β = d < (δx)2 > /dt). This method of evaluating

the tracer particle diﬀusivity to study the diﬀusion of magnetic ﬁelds in two dimension has

been adopted by Cattaneo in the context of the MHD model [5].

It is clear that for η 6= 0 and an initial distribution of power with random phases in the

13

various modes for the two ﬁelds b and ψ, Eq.2 and Eq.3 represent the case of ’decaying’

EMHD turbulence. We refrain from using a random stirring force to achieve stationary

state as this might lead to the particle displacement being dependent on the characteristics

of the random stirrer. We will here investigate the case of decaying turbulence and we will

present results in the regime where the variations can be considered as slow, i.e. we treat

the problem in the quasistatic limit.

The derivation of our main Eq.9 for the suppression of magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusivity was

premised on the notion of stationarity of the mean square magnetic potential. As discussed

earlier the cascade of the mean square magnetic potential towards longer scales ensures

attaining such a state. This can be clearly seen in Fig.4 which shows the evolution of mean

square magnetic potential with time. It is clear that the percentage variation in

ψ2dxdy

is small after t = 200. For the purpose of our calculations in all our numerical runs we have

R

restricted to the region where the percentage variations in

ψ2dxdy is below 3%.

In Fig.5 we show the mean square displacement of the tracer particles with time. The

R

thick line indicated by the label ’kinematic’ essentially corresponds to the displacement when

the uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the y direction B0 is chosen to be zero. We will designate

the slope of this curve as βkin, the kinematic diﬀusivity. The other two lines essentially

correspond to the longitudinal and the transverse displacement in the presence of a uniform

magnetic ﬁeld B0 = 1 along the y diection. It is clear from the ﬁgure that the slope of the

kinematic curve is larger than the other two curves which correspond to the displacement

for ﬁnite B0. This clearly indicates that the presence of B0 suppresses the diﬀusivity; the

conclusion we arrived at earlier in the last section. However, longitudinal displacements of

the tracer particles are larger compared to their transverse displacement, suggesting that

the assumption of isotropic turbulence in not valid in the presence of uniform magnetic

ﬁeld. There has been indications in earlier works both in MHD [6] as well as in EMHD

[7] that the presence of strong magnetic ﬁeld results in anisotropy of the spectrum. Our

results showing distinct values for the longitudinal and the transverse diﬀusivity is another

evidence for anisotropic turbulence in the presence of external magnetic ﬁeld.

14

We next investigate the question whether the supression of diﬀusivity with increasing

magnetic ﬁeld is indeed given by the kind of expression (Eq.9) that we have obtained in

the earlier section. For this purpose we carry out several numerical runs with varying

strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. The diﬀusivity β for each case is then given by the slope

of the displacement of the tracer particles. It is clear from Fig.5 that the curve is jagged,

essentially signifying that β, the diﬀusivity estimated from the slope of such a curve is a

statistical quantity. We take a time average given by

β(t2 − t1) =

t2

1
t2 − t1 Z

t1

β(t)dt

The choice of t2 − t1 is such that the in this duration the turbulence can essentially be

treated as quasistationary. The averaging procedure eliminates the statistical ﬂuctuation in

the estimate of diﬀusity and it is observed that with varying t2 the slope asymptotes to a

constant value for each case.

In Fig.6 the y axis represents βkin/β and along the x axis we vary B2

0. It is clear from

the plot that the data points nicely ﬁt a straight line, as our analytical expression predicts.

VI. DISCUSSION

There are two important results of our present work. First, we have been able to show

that the turbulent EMHD state shows tendencies towards whistlerization. The spectrum is

only partially whistlerized, suggesting that both eddies and randomly interacting whistlers

constitute the turbulent state. Secondly, we have carried out studies to understand the

diﬀusion of long scale magnetic ﬁeld in the context of Electron Magnetohydrodynamics. We

have shown that the eﬀective diﬀusivity due to turbulence in the electron ﬂow velocity gets

suppressed in the presence of small scale turbulence of the magnetic ﬁeld. For complete

whistlerization the turbulent diﬀusivity vanishes. However, since the turbulent state is only

partially whistlerized the eﬀective diﬀusivity does not vanish it only gets suppressed from

pure kinematic estimates. We have conﬁrmed these results numerically.

The problem of diﬀusion of magnetic ﬁeld lines is of great interest, as it provides a

mechanism for the reconnection of magnetic ﬁeld lines which is thought to underlie an

understanding of the rapid release of energy in several solar and astrophysical contexts. The

resistive diﬀusion turns out to be too small to explain the large amount of energy released.

This had initiated eﬀorts towards understanding the phenomenon of turbulent diﬀusivity

of magnetic ﬁeld lines. Earlier attempts on this were based on the Magnetohydrodynamic

approximation. However, it was shown theoretically by Gruzinov et al [4] and numerically

by Cattaneo [5] that the value of turbulent diﬀusivity gets suppressed in the presence of

turbulence in small scale magnetic ﬁeld. Recently, attempts to understand the reconnection

phenomenon in the context of Electron Magnetohydrodynamics are being made [2]. Our

work in this context becomes relevant, as we have shown here that the naive quasilinear

estimates do not provide a complete picture. The eﬀective diﬀusivity gets suppressed in the

presence of turbulence in the magnetic ﬁeld, with whistlerization of the spectrum playing

an important role in this regard.

Other issue that we would like to point out in this regard is the role of whistlers in EMHD

turbulence. Some recent studies on EMHD turbulence categorically rule out the presence of

whistler eﬀect in determining the energy tranfer rate on the basis of the numerically observed

scaling of the power spectrum [3]. We have, on the other hand shown here that there is a

tendency towards whistlerization of the turbulent spectra and that directly inﬂuences the

eﬀective diﬀusivity of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. Invoking the Prandtl mixing length argument,

which relates the transfer rate to the eﬀective diﬀusivity, the question of whistler eﬀect being

present or not remains debatable. Moreover, we also have evidence of anisotropization of the

turbulent spectrum in the presence of external magnetic ﬁeld ( this work will be presented

elsewhere) which further points towards a subtle role of whistlers in governing the EMHD

turbulence.

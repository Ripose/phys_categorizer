A set of reduced, 2-D, two-ﬂuid, drift-MHD (magnetohydrodynami-

cal) equations is derived. Using these equations, a complete and fully self-

consistent solution is obtained for an isolated magnetic island propagating

through a slab plasma with uniform but diﬀerent ion and electron ﬂuid veloc-

ities. The ion and electron ﬂuid ﬂow proﬁles around the island are uniquely de-

termined, and are everywhere continuous. Moreover, the island phase-velocity

is uniquely speciﬁed by the condition that there be zero net electromagnetic

force acting on the island. Finally, the ion polarization current correction to

the Rutherford island width evolution equation is evaluated, and found to be

stabilizing provided that the anomalous perpendicular ion viscosity signiﬁ-

cantly exceeds the anomalous perpendicular electron viscosity.

Tearing modes are magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) instabilities which often limit fusion

plasma performance in magnetic conﬁnement devices relying on nested toroidal magnetic

ﬂux-surfaces.1 As the name suggests, “tearing” modes tear and reconnect magnetic ﬁeld-

lines, in the process converting nested toroidal ﬂux-surfaces into helical magnetic islands.

Such islands degrade plasma conﬁnement because heat and particles are able to travel ra-

dially from one side of an island to another by ﬂowing along magnetic ﬁeld-lines, which is a

relatively fast process, instead of having to diﬀuse across magnetic ﬂux-surfaces, which is a

relatively slow process.2

Magnetic island physics is very well understood within the context of single-ﬂuid MHD

theory. According to this theory, the island width is governed by the well-known nonlinear

evolution equation due to Rutherford.3 Moreover, the island is required to propagate at the

local ﬂow velocity of the MHD ﬂuid, since ﬂuid ﬂow across the island separatrix is eﬀectively

prohibited.

Magnetic island physics is less completely understood within the context of two-ﬂuid,
drift-MHD theory,4–18 which is far more relevant to present-day magnetic conﬁnement de-

vices than single-ﬂuid theory. In two-ﬂuid theory, the island is generally embedded within

ion and electron ﬂuids which ﬂow at diﬀerent velocities. The island itself usually propagates

at some intermediate velocity. For suﬃciently wide islands, both ﬂuids are required to ﬂow

at the island propagation velocity in the region lying within the island separatrix (since

neither ﬂuid can easily cross the separatrix). However, the region immediately outside the

separatrix is characterized by strongly sheared ion and electron ﬂuid ﬂow proﬁles, as the

velocities of both ﬂuids adjust to their unperturbed values far away from the island. The

polarization current generated by the strongly sheared ion ﬂow around the island separatrix

gives rise to an additional term in the Rutherford island width evolution equation, which

is stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on the island propagation velocity relative to the

unperturbed ﬂow velocities of the ion and MHD ﬂuids. The key problems in two-ﬂuid island

theory are the unambiguous determination of the island phase-velocity, and the calculation

of the ion and electron ﬂuid ﬂow proﬁles around the island separatrix. As yet, no consensus

has emerged within the magnetic fusion community regarding the solution of these problems.

In this paper, we ﬁrst develop a set of reduced, 2-D, two-ﬂuid, drift-MHD equations.

These equations contain both electron and ion diamagnetic eﬀects (including the contri-

2

bution of the ion gyroviscous tensor), as well as the Hall eﬀect and parallel electron com-

pressibility. However, they do not contain electron inertia or the compressible Alfv´en wave

(which play negligible roles in conventional magnetic island physics). Our set of equations

consist of four coupled partial diﬀerential equations, and is both analytically tractable and

easy to solve numerically. We employ our equations to study the evolution of an isolated

magnetic island in slab geometry. Using a particular ordering scheme, we are able to cal-

culate the island phase-velocity, and to uniquely determine the ion and electron ﬂuid ﬂow

proﬁles outside the island separatrix.

II. DERIVATION OF REDUCED EQUATIONS

A. Introduction

In this section, we shall generalize the analysis of Refs. 19 and 20 to obtain a set of

reduced, 2-D, two-ﬂuid, drift-MHD equations which take ion diamagnetic ﬂows into account.

B. Basic equations

Standard right-handed Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are adopted. Consider a quasi-

neutral plasma with singly-charged ions. The ion/electron number density n0 is assumed to

be uniform and constant. Suppose that Ti = τ Te, where Ti,e is the ion/electron temperature,

and τ is uniform and constant.

Broadly following Ref. 21, we adopt the following set of two-ﬂuid, drift-MHD equations:

µi the (uniform) ion viscosity, κ the (uniform) plasma thermal conductivity, and Γ = 5/3

the plasma ratio of speciﬁc heats. Furthermore, b = B/B, and V∗ = b

The above equations take into account the anisotropic ion gyroviscous tensor, but neglect

electron inertia. Our system of equations is completed by Maxwell’s equations:

the sense that they do not contain the compressible Alfv´en wave. However, they do contain

the shear-Alfv´en wave, the magnetoacoustic wave, the whistler wave, and the kinetic-Alfv´en

wave. Our equations are similar to the “four-ﬁeld” equations of Hazeltine, Kotschenreuther,

and Morrison,22 except that they are not limited to small values of β.

III. ISLAND PHYSICS

A. Introduction

The aim of this section is to derive expressions determining the phase-velocity and width

of an isolated magnetic island (representing the ﬁnal, nonlinear stage of a tearing instability)

from the previously derived set of reduced, 2-D, two-ﬂuid, drift-MHD equations.

Consider a slab plasma which is periodic in the y-direction with periodicity length l. Let

the system be symmetric about x = 0: i.e., ψ(

x, y, t) = ψ(x, y, t), Z(

x, y, t) =

Z(x, y, t),

magnetic island, centered on x = 0. It is convenient to transform to the island rest-frame,

in which ∂/∂t

0. Suppose that the island is embedded in a plasma with uniform (but

≃

diﬀerent) y-directed ion and electron ﬂuid velocities. We are searching for an island solution

in which the ion/electron ﬂuid velocities asymptote to these uniform velocities far from the

island separatrix.

B. Island geometry

In the immediate vicinity of the island, we can write

ψ(x, θ, t) =

+ Ψ (t) cos θ,

(22)

x2

where θ = k y, k = 2π/l, and Ψ (t) > 0 is the reconnected magnetic ﬂux (which is assumed to

have a very weak time dependence). As is well-known, the above expression for ψ describes

a “cat’s eye” magnetic island of full-width (in the x-direction) W = 4 w, where w = √Ψ .

The region inside the magnetic separatrix corresponds to ψ >

Ψ , the region outside the

−

separatrix corresponds to ψ <

Ψ , and the separatrix itself corresponds to ψ =

We adopt the following ordering of terms appearing in Eqs. (26)–(29): ψ = ψ(0), φ =

(s, ψ, θ), δJ = δJ (2)(s, ψ, θ).

and dΨ/dt = dΨ (4)/dt. Here, the superscript (i) indicated an ith order quantity. This

ordering, which is completely self-consistent, implies weak (i.e., strongly sub-Alfv´enic and

sub-magnetoacoustic) diamagnetic ﬂows, and very long (i.e., very much longer than the

Alfv´en time) transport evolution time-scales. According to our scheme, both Z and φ are

ﬂux-surface functions, to lowest order. In other words, the lowest order electron and ion

stream-functions, φe = φ

dβ Z and φi = φ + dβ τ Z, respectively, are ﬂux-surface functions.

Here, we have neglected the superscripts on zeroth order quantities, for the sake of clarity.

In the following, we shall neglect all superscripts, except for those on φ(3) and Z (3), for ease

of notation.

E. Boundary conditions

It is easily demonstrated that the y-components of the (lowest order) electron and ion

ﬂuid velocities (in the island rest frame) take the form Ve y = x (M

dβ L) and Vi y =

−

x (M + dβ τ L), respectively.

Incidentally, since Ve y and Vi y are even functions of x, it

follows that M(s, ψ) and L(s, ψ) are odd functions. We immediately conclude that M(s, ψ)

and L(s, ψ) are both zero inside the island separatrix (since it is impossible to have a non-

zero odd ﬂux-surface function in this region). Now, we are searching for island solutions for

which x M

match to an unperturbed plasma far from the island. If V (0)

i y are the unperturbed

y-directed electron and ion ﬂuid velocities in the lab. frame, then V (0)

Now, for an isolated magnetic island which is not interacting electromagnetically with any

external structure, such as a resistive wall, the net electromagnetic force acting on the island

must be zero. This constraint translates to the well-known requirement that

In other words, the island phase-velocity is the viscosity weighted mean of the unperturbed

ion and electron ﬂuid velocities. Hence, if the ions are far more viscous then the electrons,

then the island propagates with the ion ﬂuid.

In this case, the ion ﬂuid velocity proﬁle

remains largely unaﬀected by the island, but the electron ﬂuid velocity proﬁle is highly

sheared just outside the island separatrix. The opposite is true if the electrons are far more

viscous than the ions. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISSCUSION

A set of reduced, 2-D, two-ﬂuid, drift-MHD equations is developed. This set of equations

takes into account both electron and ion diamagnetism (including the contribution of the

ion gyroviscous tensor), as well as the Hall eﬀect and parallel electron compressibility, but

neglects electron inertia and the compressible Alfv´en wave. For the sake of simplicity, the

plasma density is assumed to be uniform, and the ion and electron temperatures constant

multiples of one another. However, these constraints could easily be relaxed.

Using our equations, we have derived a complete and self-consistent solution for an iso-

lated magnetic island propagating through a slab plasma with uniform but diﬀerent ion and

electron ﬂuid velocities. Our solution is valid provided that the ordering scheme described

in Sect. III D holds good, and the island width W is suﬃciently large that

(i.e., δ

≪

(i.e., ǫ

≪

Note that the ordering scheme described in Sect. III D implies that ω∗ ≪

kk cs, kk vA

where ω∗ is a typical diamagnetic frequency, cs the sound speed, and vA the shear-Alfv´en

speed. Here, kk must be evaluated at the edge of the island. This scheme diﬀers from that

adopted in Ref. 16, for which kk cs ≪
much less complicated calculation of the ﬂow proﬁles around the island than that described

ω∗. It turns out that our ordering scheme permits a

in Ref. 16.

Within our solution, the ion and electron ﬂuid velocity proﬁles are uniquely determined

in the vicinity of the island [see Fig. 1]. These proﬁles are everywhere continuous and

asymptote to the unperturbed ﬂuid velocities far from the island. Incidentally, the inclusion

of electron viscosity in both the Ohm’s law and the plasma equation of motion is key to the

determination of continuous velocity proﬁles.15

The island phase-velocity is uniquely speciﬁed by the condition that there be zero net

electromagnetic force acting on the island [see Eq. (52)]. It turns out that the phase-velocity

is the viscosity weighted mean of the unperturbed ion and electron ﬂuid velocities. In this pa-

per, we have adopted phenomenological diﬀusive ion and electron viscosity operators, which

are supposed to represent anomalous perpendicular momentum transport due to small-scale

plasma turbulence.

The ion polarization current correction to the Rutherford island width evolution equa-

tion is found to be stabilizing when the island phase-velocity lies between the unperturbed

ion ﬂuid velocity and the unperturbed E

B velocity [see Eq. (62)].16 It follows, from our

result for the island phase-velocity, that the polarization term is stabilizing when the anoma-

lous perpendicular ion viscosity signiﬁcantly exceeds the anomalous perpendicular electron

×

17

viscosity [see Fig. 1, left panel]. Conversely, the polarization term is destabilizing when

the electron viscosity signiﬁcantly exceeds the ion viscosity [see Fig. 1, right panel].24 Note,

however, that in order for the electron viscosity to exceed the ion viscosity, the electron

momentum conﬁnement time would need to be at least a mass ratio smaller than the ion

momentum conﬁnement time, which does not seem very probable. Hence, we conclude that

under normal circumstances the polarization term is stabilizing.

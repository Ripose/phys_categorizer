The aim of this paper is to ﬁnd the spectrum of electromagnetic waves propagating in a strongly coupled magnetized
fully ionized hydrogen plasma [1] without taking into account the ion motion. We make use of the dielectric tensor of
cold magnetized plasmas constructed in Ref. [2] by means of the classical theory of moments.

In neglect of thermal motion this dielectric tensor reads:

We will consider the damping of the modes in question as negligibly small. This assumption obviously can be
veriﬁed only experimentally. The damping can be essential and must be taken into account near the cyclotron
resonances. Here the thermal motion of the particles leading to the spatial dispersion must be accounted for also.
Thus our results are valid only far from the cyclotron resonances and in coupled plasma systems with the plasma
parameter Γ = e2/aT >

so that their eﬀective collisional frequency ν = ω2
p/4πσ is at least an order of magnitude smaller than ωp. Similar
conditions can also be realized in astrophysical systems (crust of neutron stars, the interior of white dwarfs and large
planets with very strong magnetic ﬁelds, etc.). Further we will regard only long wavelengths modes for which the
condition of a cold plasma [3] holds. In addition the frequencies of these modes will be presumed to be much higher
than the ion cyclotron frequency, so that the ion motion contribution could be neglected.

II. WAVES IN STRONGLY COUPLED MAGNETIZED PLASMAS

If we choose the Cartesian system of coordinates with the z-axis parallel to the external magnetic ﬁeld ~B, then the

dispersion equation of electromagnetic waves propagating in a magnetized plasma takes the form:

which are usually associated with ordinary and extraordinary waves: two diﬀerent kinds of waves of a given frequency
and with diﬀerent refraction indices, which can propagate in magnetized plasmas. These waves are generally elliptically
polarized, a wave which propagates along the external magnetic ﬁeld is transverse polarized; the ordinary wave is
characterized by the right-handed circular polarization, the extraordinary wave is left-handed polarized.

The branches of propagation (N 2(ω) > 0) are associated with the eigenfrequencies ωk. The latter are given in Fig.2
vs. wavevector. The modes ωk are determined by Eq. (4). Since in the present approximation Eq. (4) is the ﬁfth
order equation (with respect to ω2), we ﬁnd ﬁve eigenmodes. In ideal plasmas in neglect of the Alfv´en wave only four
eigenfrequencies can be found. From Fig. 2 we observe that in the case of a strongly coupled plasma the ideal plasma
helicon wave splits into two branches, which we call the strongly coupled plasma whistling sound waves.

Thus in strongly coupled magnetized plasma there can exist ﬁve eigenmodes: ordinary and extraordinary whistling

sound waves, the slow extraordinary, the ordinary and the fast extraordinary waves.

Consider now in more details the dispersion of the whistling sound waves at small wavenumbers, i.e., when ω

ωB.
In this spectral region the dispersion equation reduces to a quadratic equation with respect to ω2. For the case of
parallel with respect to the external magnetic ﬁeld propagation the corresponding solution reads:

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this note the dispersion laws for electromagnetic waves in cold magnetized plasmas are analyzed. Our analysis is
based on the expression for the plasma dielectric tensor obtained from the classical theory of moments without using
perturbation parameters. Thus both the cases of weak and strong Coulomb coupling are regarded. A qualitative
distinction between systems with weak and strong Coulomb coupling is established in their low-frequency electromag-
netic wave propagation spectra. It is shown that the weakly coupled plasma helicon branch splits in strongly coupled
plasmas into two whistling sound branches. The coupling parameters thermodynamic dependence is estimated.

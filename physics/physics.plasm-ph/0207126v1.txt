The competition between drift wave and interchange physics in general
E-cross-B drift turbulence is studied with computations in three dimen-
sional tokamak ﬂux tube geometry. For a given set of background scales,
the parameter space can be covered by the plasma beta and drift wave
collisionality. At large enough plasma beta the turbulence breaks out
into ideal ballooning modes and saturates only by depleting the free en-
ergy in the background pressure gradient. At high collisionality it ﬁnds
a more gradual transition to resistive ballooning. At moderate beta and
collisionality it retains drift wave character, qualitatively identical to
simple two dimensional slab models. The underlying cause is the nonlin-
ear vorticity advection through which the self sustained drift wave tur-
bulence supersedes the linear instabilities, scattering them apart before
they can grow, imposing its own physical character on the dynamics.
This vorticity advection catalyses the gradient drive, while saturation
occurs solely through turbulent mixing of pressure disturbances. This
situation persists in the whole of tokamak edge parameter space. Both
simpliﬁed isothermal models and complete warm ion models are treated.

I. Introduction — More Than One Eigenmode in Turbulence

Edge turbulence in tokamak ﬂux tube geometry has been treated by models working

from a drift wave [1,2] or resistive ballooning [3,4,5] paradigm. Beyond computing edge
transport, the main purpose of these computations is to understand the underlying physical
character of the turbulence: drive and saturation mechanisms and free energy transfer
channels.

The pure situation of drift wave turbulence is slab geometry in a sheared magnetic
ﬁeld, and all of its basic processes can be found in the simpliﬁed two dimensional models in
which it was ﬁrst studied [6,7,8,9,10,11]. The idealised state is one of adiabatic electrons,
towards which the electron dynamics parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld B tends:

terms constitute the adiabatic coupling mechanism, which allows the free energy liberated
from the background gradient to enter the parallel current. The more familiar Alfv´enic
coupling with B
φ then allows the free energy to enter the ExB ﬂow eddies. This is the
free energy pathway between the background gradient and the turbulence which gives rise
to drift waves, and collectively the adiabatic and Alfv´enic couplings constitute the drift
wave coupling mechanism
φ among the respective disturbances. It is important
to note in this context that the parallel gradient cannot vanish for ﬁnite sized disturbances
on closed magnetic ﬂux surfaces (the ﬂux tube geometry is globally consistent [12]), so this
adiabatic response is always excited by electron pressure disturbances.

The pure situation of resistive ballooning mode turbulence or ideal ballooning in-

In this case, the adiabatic

through the magnetic curvature and gradient, which give rise to a ﬁnite compressibility of

the diamagnetic current and hence the well known interchange eﬀect. In toroidal geome-

try, this leads to the ballooning mode since the interchange eﬀect is destabilising only on

the outer part of the torus, where the radius of curvature and gradient-B vectors become

parallel to the pressure gradient. The ideal form of this dynamics as an instability in

toroidal geometry was discovered in attempts to explain curious observations of magnetic

ﬂuctuations localised to the outboard side of the PLT tokamak [14]. These ﬂuctuations

were explained as ideal ballooning modes, which were treated conventionally [15] as well as

with what became known as the ballooning transformation [16,17,18]. Resistive ballooning

[19] was invoked to explain the existence of tokamak edge turbulence at pressure gradient

values below the ideal stability limit and at amplitudes seemingly unattainable by other

mechanisms [20,21], and has also been the focus of many linear MHD calculations [22].

More recently [23], the ballooning paradigm was extended to situations including the two
ﬂuid Ohm’s law (i.e., the adiabatic response), leading to the ballooning mode approach

to edge turbulence [3,4,5], coinciding with the development of the earliest treatments of

ﬂux tube geometry, which were originally constructed with ballooning modes speciﬁcally

in mind [24,25].

The new phenomenon which arose with the three dimensional ﬂux tube models is the

simultaneous presence of these two quite diﬀerent types of eigenmode in the same dynami-

cal system. Obviously, there is only one electrostatic potential, so it is not germane to treat

both processes separately and simply add up the resulting growth rates and hence mixing

length transport estimates (which one could do for linear eigenmodes if the wavenumbers

and frequencies were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent). We have a situation of ExB turbulence in the

presence of a background pressure gradient, which is the basic free energy source for both

eigenmode types. What diﬀers is the energy transfer channel, that is, parallel dynamics

or interchange forcing. The MHD model contains the interchange mechanism but neglects

the drift wave mechanism by omitting the adiabatic coupling. The slab drift wave model

neglects the interchange mechanism by omitting the gradient-B and magnetic curvature

eﬀects. One must obviously retain these interchange eﬀects in a toroidal model, so the

principal consideration becomes the adiabatic response: the neglect of that limits the va-
lidity of the MHD model to situations in which the disturbances satisfy
φ/Te (cf.
e
Eq. 1). For purely parallel (shear Alfv´en) dynamics this is satisﬁed if k⊥ρs ≪
1 [26], where
ρs is the drift scale at which simple linear drift waves principally occur. However, for ExB
motion driven by a pressure gradient, the typical dynamical frequencies are comparable
to ω∗, the diamagnetic frequency, and hence ExB advection of the pressure will render

φ/Te, which is the situation of drift waves (note that this does not mean adia-
pe/pe ∼
e
batic electrons, as the phase remains arbitrary and the equality need not be very close).
e
The MHD paradigm is therefore not useful in addressing this situation; moreover, it is

e

impossible even to discuss drift waves within MHD due to the missing adiabatic coupling

mechanism.

The competition between the two types of eigenmode is strongly complicated by non-

linear physics, when one addresses turbulence. For linear drift waves in the presence of

interchange forcing, it can be shown that the interchange forcing can be the principal

mechanism leading to a ﬁnite parallel current divergence and therefore departures from

the adiabatic state, hence phase shift, over a wide range of parameters. This phenomenon

is what gave rise to the “drift resistive ballooning” paradigm, in which it was originally
attempted to order ρs small in the dynamics [23]. Indeed, the scales of motion in that
paradigm are derived from the assumption that interchange forcing balances the paral-

lel current divergence. On the other hand, it was already known that while the linear

polarisation drift by itself could only cause a weak nonadiabatic response, the nonlinear

dynamics greatly transforms the mode structure of the turbulence [7], leading to robust

turbulence even in models with no linear instability at all [10]. Early attempts to treat

simple interchange forcing within such models showed that under certain circumstances

the interchange forcing did not aﬀect the turbulence even if it could cause signiﬁcant lin-

ear instabilities [27], a result which was conﬁrmed by three dimensional studies [1].

If

the nonlinear polarisation drift is strong enough to overcome the interchange forcing in

the turbulence, it will provide the balance with the parallel current thereby maintaining
electron nonadiabaticity, and the principal scale of motion will vary mostly with ρs even
though it is larger than ρs. This is even true in two dimensional slab turbulence, where
there is also dependence on dimensionless parameters such as the collisionality [10]. In

three dimensional electromagnetic computations, a ﬁnite plasma beta was found to en-

hance the nonlinear drift wave as well as the interchange (ideal ballooning) eﬀects [2]. It
therefore becomes crucial to resolve ρs in any computation of tokamak edge turbulence,
and crucial further to use a formulation of the magnetic geometry which represents both

slab and toroidal mode structure equally well. For the question of what type of mode

structure obtains is closely related to which of the polarisation or diamagnetic currents

provide the balance with the parallel current under the total divergence.

In this Article we treat the competition between drift wave and interchange physics

for control of the turbulence in detail. Firstly working within the simplest model treating

both eigenmode types (isothermal electrons, cold ions, where the diﬀerence to MHD is in

4

a single pair of terms) we choose parallel and perpendicular scales typical of edge proﬁles
in modern tokamaks and sweep the plasma beta and collisionality parameters, which is

the same thing as varying temperature and density at ﬁxed gradient scale length. We

compare the details of the mode structure — amplitude ratios, parallel structure, phase
shifts, cross coherence, and drive spectrum — to control cases reﬂecting the pure situation

of both eigenmode types. We also directly measure the details of the vorticity dynamics

— mean squared divergences of the pieces of the total current and mean squared transfer
eﬀects — to ﬁnd which two mechanisms are in statistical balance. This gives a rather more

complete picture than one would have merely with the usual time traces of transport levels

and contour plots showing spatial morphology.

We ﬁnd that the transitions to both ideal and resistive ballooning turbulence are well

deﬁned, and that the “working area” of tokamak edge density/temperature parameter

space is occupied by drift wave turbulence. By studying situations where an interchange
driven linear eigenmode makes the transition to fully developed turbulence, we also show

that the reason for the drift wave character is the nonlinear polarisation drift, which

replaces the diamagnetic current as the main balance for parallel currents and nonadiabatic

It is always dangerous to form one’s insight for turbulence from the
electron activity.
properties of linear eigenmodes, and this error is essentially what happened to the drift

resistive ballooning paradigm. The conclusions of linear theory are not valid for turbulence,

because drift wave turbulence is very much more robust than linear drift waves are: in a
variant of the well known ExB shear suppression scenario [28], the rms vorticity level of the

turbulence is larger than the ideal interchange growth rate in this steep gradient regime,

and so the small scale linear instabilities arising from ballooning eﬀects are superseded
by the nonlinear drift wave instability which imposes its own physical character on the

dynamics. Finally, though the subject deserves its own treatment in a separate paper,

we address the question of the saturation mechanism, with the result that the vorticity
nonlinearity always drives while the pressure one provides saturation, as in the pure drift

wave case.

II. The DALF3 Model

The most basic model of ExB drift turbulence containing both drift wave and inter-

change physics is a four ﬁeld model in tokamak ﬂux tube geometry which we call DALF3,

for three dimensional drift Alfv´en turbulence [2]. The magnetic geometry is assumed to
be a set of nested, toroidal, axisymmetric ﬂux surfaces, on which one can deﬁne a glob-

ally consistent ﬂux tube [12]; this is a matter of deﬁning Hamada coordinates aligned to

5

the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld B for which there is only one nonvanishing contravariant
component, which is a ﬂux function, and applying the parallel boundary condition after
one connection length Lk, ensuring that all degrees of freedom in the ﬂux tube actually
exist on the ﬂux surface for which it is a model. A technique called “shifted metric” then
re-adapts the geometry so as to represent slab and toroidal mode structure equally well,
by providing for a perpendicular metric which is locally diagonal within each drift plane
perpendicular to B [29]. Following the local drift scale ordering, the dependence of the
metric on all coordinates except the one parallel to B is neglected (cf. Ref. [25]).

A more general model will be brieﬂy invoked in the Section IX to show that the results
are not dependent on the neglect of the temperatures, but the usefulness of DALF3 is its
closeness to resistive, reduced MHD: the two models diﬀer only in the presence or absence
of the adiabatic coupling mechanism and of the (nearly negligible) diamagnetic heat ﬂux
in the pressure equation. This allows investigation of the special eﬀects of the adiabatic

IV. Drift Wave and Interchange Control Cases

Here we re-examine two dimensional drift wave and interchange turbulence models,
in order to provide a control for the analysis below. From the DALF3 model we neglect
the s-direction, and set ˆβ = ˆµ = 0, substituting the resulting collisional Ohm’s law into
2
Eqs. (3,5). We replace
k with the positive constant parameter D for the dynamics
Jk, and neglect sound wave motion. This reverts to the well known Hasegawa-
involving
Wakatani model [7] with interchange forcing. We also add a damping term γd
φ to allow
the interchange case to saturate. The resulting two dimensional control model is

The drift wave version uses D = 0.05 and ωB = γd = 0, and the interchange version uses

the ky = 0 components at each time step. Within the single drift plane, we use the same
domain size and initial state as in the three dimensional model. We start both models

wave coupling mechanism is very clear: For the drift wave case the cross coherence is
signiﬁcant and the phase shift distributions are narrow and close to zero (essentially all
activity below about αpφ = π/4). It is important to note that this aﬀects every mode in

V. Direct Comparison of DALF3 to Resistive MHD
e

e

We now run computations within the full DALF3 model and compare them to the
resistive MHD model at the same parameters. The MHD model is a reduced MHD case,
in which under the drift approximation the ExB ﬂow is dynamically incompressible, and
so the perpendicular electric ﬁeld is electrostatic, just as in the drift wave model. The
pressure is the total pressure in MHD, but within a cold ion model the total pressure is
simply pe. The cold ion model without temperature eﬀects is therefore the closest to the
corresponding MHD case. The only diﬀerence in the physics is the adiabatic coupling
mechanism

In the MHD model this coupling is absent, and the diamagnetic ﬂux

divergence is neglected in the pressure equation; in all other respects the DALF3 and
MHD models are identical (in MHD the distinction between warm or cold ions is lost
through the neglect of the diamagnetic ﬂow vorticity and gyroviscosity, and the neglect of
the adiabatic coupling mechanism in the electrons). The MHD model appears as

as a whole, while the phase shift spectrum shows each component. We can see that the

transition is in the longer wavelengths, while the cross coherence is inﬂuenced also by the

smaller scale activity which remains in a drift wave mode structure.

In the drift wave

wavelengths cannot separate and form the transition to interchange dominated turbulence,

the longer wavelengths are controlled by the shorter ones.

quantities are the rms levels of these transfer channels, since their importance to the

turbulence is in their maintenance of each part of the energetics at ﬁnite levels, whatever

the instantaneous sign. The results may be compared to those for drift wave and for

interchange turbulence.

VI. The Role of Interchange Forcing in Drift Wave Turbulence

It is instructive to examine the eﬀect of the interchange terms, which do the in-
terchange forcing, on simple linear drift waves with prescribed, constant k⊥ and kk. This
k2
⊥,
version of the linearised equations takes a single Fourier component by setting
iωBky. To ﬁnd the
and
fate of the instabilities, all we need to know is the response of
φ in order to ﬁnd the
dispersion relation, because the resulting phase shift is closely related to the linear growth
rate. The vorticity equation and Ohm’s law, Eqs. (3) and (4), are all we need. Using the
relations ω∗ = ωpky and ωc = ωBky, their linearised form is

As with drift waves proper, the consideration of the phase shift is only important when
kk is ﬁnite, enough so that k2
k is the largest term in both numerator and denominator of
Eq. (35). If this is so, then the phase shift is small. It then follows that the eigenmode has
the same properties as a drift wave, merely with a diﬀerent excitation mechanism for the
phase shift. But the role of the interchange forcing in this case is simply to excite a phase
shift and thereby cause the turbulence to be driven by the background gradient. This is the
same role the polarisation drift has for drift waves, and the same role its nonlinear version,
the vorticity nonlinearity, has for drift wave turbulence. Even in this regime dominated

16

by parallel dynamics, the interchange eﬀects can assume control and change the mode
structure if they dominantly cause the phase shift. We note here that the ﬁniteness of
kk for ﬁnite ky is guaranteed by the combination of magnetic shear and toroidal topology
(closed ﬂux surfaces), that is, ﬁeld line connection [12].

VII. Linear versus Nonlinear Mode Structure

The reason that the result of this investigation for the turbulence is so diﬀerent than
what one might expect by looking at linear instabilities is that the nonadiabatic character
of drift waves, especially, is greatly changed by their associated nonlinearities. The one with
the strongest eﬀect is the nonlinear polarisation drift — equivalently, the self advection of
unsteady ExB vortices, or eddies — which is the mechanism through which the turbulence
has such strengthened parallel current dynamics, and hence more net nonadiabaticity of
the electrons than those linear eigenmodes. This is the reason for and importance of the
distinction between drift waves and drift wave turbulence.

We can investigate this directly by starting the dynamics with an initial state in the
linear stage with a linear instability strongly driven by the interchange forcing, and then
tracking the evolution of the mode structure through the saturation stage, which is the
transition from the linear stage towards the turbulence, and then into the fully developed
turbulence in which there is no detailed memory of whatever transpires several correlation
times before.

The initial state is the same as before, just with an amplitude of a0 = 3

10−10
instead of the usual 3.0. We take a single case, that given by the nominal parameters in
Eq. (18), but with ν = 10 (hence C = 25.5 and νB = 1.25) and µk = 0. The resolution
in the x-direction is increased fourfold to diminish the eﬀects of linear grid modes (the
same domain size as before is used in all three dimensions, but the node count is now
16; grid modes result from the failure to resolve the rational surface density in
256
x for the largest ky component on the grid). The time traces of the amplitudes, transport,
and energetics are shown in Fig. 11. The linear instability develops, and reaches a constant
growth rate which is quite large, about 0.15 in the units of cs/L⊥ (in which the ideal
1/2 = 0.22). When the disturbances reach ﬁnite
interchange growth rate is about ωB
amplitude, the growth rate rapidly drops to zero. This is the onset of saturation (the
exact moment for this case is t = 201). Then, the growth rate begins to ﬂuctuate, rises
away from zero for a short while, and then approaches zero again up to some statistical
ﬂuctuation on the scale of a correlation time. This is the mode structure adjustment

17

stage, beginning for this case with the next rise of ΓT above zero at t = 212 and ending
at t = 345 with the next drop of ΓT back to zero. The transport overshoots before
settling, peaking near t = 200, quickly dropping by half to about t = 210, and then slowly
strengthening throughout the adjustment stage until statistical saturation is reached after
about t = 400 for the turbulence and after t = 600 for the larger scale ExB ﬂows. For
lower C the linear instability is conﬁned to rather smaller scales, with more immediately
eﬃcient nonlinear decorrelation, and the overshoot is barely noticeable. In either case, the
transport and overall growth rate reach statistical saturation only some several ∆t = 100
after initial saturation, by which time the drive and amplitude spectra have their ﬁnal
form. (Preliminary studies of these eﬀects with only 32
128 grid nodes in the drift plane
showed much stronger overshoot, with a longer period of statistical ﬂuctuation before
saturation — by comparison to the result shown here with full resolution one can conclude

×

such behaviour is a manifestation of too few degrees of freedom in the turbulence.) This
is the stage of fully developed turbulence, which we can see has a very distinct separation
in time from the prior two stages. Full saturation also occurs only after the zonal ﬂows
(the ky = 0 and kk = 0 component of
φ), to which the turbulence is energetically coupled
[36,37], reach statistical equilibrium, in this case after about t = 600.

e

These time traces show evidence for complete supersession of the linear instability
by the drift wave turbulence. The last frame (lower right) of Fig. 11 compares the rms
vorticity (mostly at 0.3 < k⊥ρs < 1.0; see below) to the linear growth and nonlinear drive
rates. In the conventional mixing picture of turbulence driven by a linear instability, the

said to be driven by the instability and decorrelated nonlinearly by their vorticity, leading

where Dmix is the turbulent diﬀusivity. In this situation, however, we have found not only
that Ωrms is much larger than γL, but also that the overall drive rate Γ+ is signiﬁcantly
lower for fully saturated turbulence than either the drive or overall growth rates in the
linear stage. This means that the turbulence is producing its own vorticity through the
process of nonlinear self sustainment [10], and the reason that the linear instability at small
scale has so little eﬀect on the turbulence mode structure, as we have seen, is that small
scale structures are scattered apart by the vorticity before they can grow. The dynamics
therefore does not feel the linear instability in these scales. This is a generalisation of the

18

ideas of linear mixing length models as well as of the linear ExB shear-suppression scenario
[28], simply instead of the instability being suppressed by background ExB vorticity (ΩE =
∂VE/∂x), it is suppressed by turbulent ExB vorticity:

that observed in the earliest collisional drift wave turbulence computations [7]. On top of
the turbulence, the zonal ﬂows develop as eddies serendipitously line up in the y-direction
and then reinforce themselves by tilting the eddies into an energy-losing relationship vis-
a-vis the ﬂow [38]; these are visible as vertical stripes in the pattern of φ(x, y). These
striking visual changes provide motivation for the statement that the properties of linear
instabilities have no a priori relevance to the turbulence. But to really ﬁnd out whether
the linear stage is relevant, we have to examine the mode structure in both stages.

The diagnostics we have been using for the turbulence show important diﬀerences be-
tween the linear, saturation, and fully developed turbulent stages. The dynamical transfer
spectra for the ExB vorticity are shown for the transition stage in Fig. 14, noting that the
state quickly approaches what we see in Fig. 6. In the linear stage, the nonlinear polarisa-
tion drift is obviously negligible and there is a tight balance between interchange forcing
and nonadiabaticity (which also shows that the linear polarisation drift, which involves
the partial time derivative, is subdominant). As in the interchange turbulence cases, the
linear stage of the DALF3 model shows a close balance between interchange forcing and
the parallel current divergence. We therefore have an interchange-dominated linear insta-
bility. Through the saturation stage, the polarisation drift enters, and in the end state the

of the system along ﬁeld lines, through sound wave dynamics.

Finally, the phase shift distributions are examined in the stages of linear growth,

nonlinear structural adjustment, and fully developed turbulence in Fig. 16. For this choice
0.15), a signiﬁcant fraction of
of parameters the linear instability is very strong (γL ≈
1/2 = 0.22). Its dominant range is
the nominal ideal interchange growth rate (γI = ωB
about 0.2 < kyρs < 1.0. When this range becomes nonlinear, the ﬁrst consequence for the
phases is that the large phase shifts in the range kyρs > 0.3 are eliminated, replaced by a
wide distribution which also includes negative values. At late times the long wavelength

component ﬁnds its structure — the frame on the right of Fig. 16 shows the same character

as the corresponding case in Fig. 5.

Indeed, the saturated state is independent of the

previous history beyond a few correlation times; here, the correlation time is about 6, and

long term, large scale memory persists no longer than about ten of these. With the short

correlation time of the turbulence, the initial state with which the turbulence is reached

is not relevant to consideration of its mode structure or underlying dynamics. It follows

that this applies also to linear instabilities. Whether these are relevant depends on the

particular case and can be demonstrated only by diagnostics taken on the fully developed

turbulence in its own context.

In the present case, the interchange forcing is relevant to the longer wavelengths kyρs <
0.1, not to the range of largest linear growth rate. The reason is that the rms vorticity

of the turbulence is strongly scale dependent, able to supersede the linear instability in
the ﬁrst decade longward of the ρs scale, but quickly reduced in robustness at larger
scale due to the factors of k⊥ in the vorticity nonlinearity (note the factors of k⊥ in
Eq. 37). This is made clear if we plot the dynamical transfer spectra for the ExB vorticity
against k⊥ rather than ky, as in Fig. 17. The spectra are normalised to the total ExB
energy. The linear growth stage (50 < t < 150) shows the linear instability peaking at
k⊥ρs
its own character in that same spectral range. In the stage of fully developed turbulence,

the larger scales ﬁnd their saturated state, and in this case the interchange eﬀects clearly

20

control the range k⊥ρs < 0.1. Whether the turbulence is ultimately of the drift wave
or interchange type depends on whether this larger scale range can decouple from the
nonlinear vorticity dynamics which is mostly at 0.3 < k⊥ρs < 1.0. If the linear eﬀects
are important only in this small scale range, then the linear instabilities are completely
superseded by the turbulence and do not play a role in its dynamics.

The linear analysis shows that ωB is often the dominant eﬀect in creating a nonzero
phase shift αpφ and hence the linear instability, giving it a ballooning physical (not just
morphological) character. But as the linear eigenmode reaches ﬁnite amplitude and the

nonlinearities emerge, the turbulence not only saturates but changes its physical character.

The mechanism maintaining the ﬁnite level of the parallel current changes from interchange

forcing to the polarisation drift. We saw in the vorticity dynamical spectra in Fig. 6, that

in the fully developed turbulence the interchange forcing does not assume control until the

collisionality reaches what we found as the resistive ballooning threshold. The threshold

is at about

(νB)crit = (CωB)crit = 1

(38)

which is the boundary beyond which the interchange eﬀects overcome the adiabatic re-

sponse. At that threshold the transport does not sharply change, but the mode structure

does so. So we can properly think of this transition as an eigenmode regime boundary,

and of the turbulence to the low collisionality side of it as drift wave turbulence.

The supersession of the linear instability spectrum found by the preceding analysis is

the same as was recently shown in a detailed study of the drift wave nonlinear instability

[39]. Not only does this form of self sustained turbulence cause turbulence in a sheared

slab geometry when initialised at ﬁnite amplitude [10], it can also impose itself in favour

of the linear instability mechanisms provided these are active in the same spectral range.
The vorticity dynamics is active principally in the spectral range 0.3 < k⊥ρs < 1.0. Linear
instabilities in this range are only relevant if they are strong enough to overcome the

dynamical rate indicated by the rms vorticity of the turbulence — a reasonable rule of

thumb would be a diamagnetic level of vorticity given by

(unity in normalised units), where vD = csρs/Lp is the diamagnetic velocity. ExB ﬂow
shear must be stronger than this to suppress the turbulence [33]. Short wavelength linear

instabilities will be relevant only if

i.e., their growth rate overcomes this. Long wavelength linear instabilities are always
relevant because they can easily take over the spectrum against what is in this range a
relatively weak vorticity nonlinearity. The result is, though resistive ballooning is not
important to tokamak edge turbulence, ideal ballooning and other such large scale MHD
instabilities are always relevant.

The result that the turbulence changes character from the initial linear eigenmode due
to supersession by vorticity scattering (Ωrms > γL but with little direct dissipation) is also
interesting because the resulting nonlinear drive rate Γ+ is quite smaller than the original
γL, even for this borderline drift wave/interchange case. It shows that contrary to usual
practice (cf. Ref. [23]), the judgement as to whether a linear or nonlinear instability has
principal relevance should not rest on which one in its own native model produces the larger
anomalous transport coeﬃcient (i.e., net turbulent ﬂux). If a simple comparison is to be
made, the one between Ωrms and γL is more useful. But one should be careful about the
k⊥-dependence of both, and ultimately a comprehensive set of numerical solutions to the
nonlinear equations containing both models is required to make an informed judgement.
The same is true of the nonlinear saturation mechanism, to which we now turn.

The roles of the principal nonlinearities, vE · ∇∇

the DALF3 model to the two dimensional drift wave model in a simple test in which we
remove either of the two principal nonlinearities from the model. As a baseline case we
take the DALF3 model run to t = 1000, well into saturation, for the nominal parameters
given in Eq. (18), but with ν = 2 (hence C = 5.1 and νB = 0.25) and µk = 0. Then, we

The 2D model in which the nonlinear instability was ﬁrst demonstrated is the the 2D
sheared-slab model, a simple generalisation of the Hasegawa-Wakatani model to incorpo-
rate magnetic shear: the collisional, electrostatic limit is obtained by taking ˆβ = ˆµ = 0,
neglecting any dependence in the s-direction, and replacing
∇k with x(∂/∂y), that is, the
coordinate system is not ﬁeld aligned [10]. In that model the details of the dynamics are
complicated by the way kk is tied to x; among the nonlinearities, retaining only vE · ∇∇
φ
causes the entire x-domain of the turbulence to be narrowed (as is the case with adiabatic
e
electron turbulence [9]), while retaining only vE · ∇
pe causes the x-domain to spread.
These results were found by taking the 2D slab restrictions within the present DALF3
code and running with a resolution of 128
512 grid nodes in x and y, within the same
80 in units of πρs, respectively. The cases run were C = 1, 10, and
xy-domain size of 20

same as in the 3D model: vE · ∇∇

In three dimensions the degrees of freedom represented by x and kk are independent,
and the situation is clearer: the slab model which one obtains by setting ωB = 0 produces
the same results [33] both quantitatively and qualitatively as in the toroidal case shown in
this Section, except for the eﬀect of the toroidal case’s linear instability in the absence of
vE ·∇∇
φ. Removal of the vorticity nonlinearity leads to linear drive (in the toroidal case)
and saturation. Removal of the pressure nonlinearity leads to ever growing turbulence and

drives and the pressure nonlinearity always saturates. One important consequence is that
all scenarios which rely on Kelvin-Helmholtz eﬀects on turbulent ﬂows for saturation of
tokamak edge turbulence are ruled out.

We brieﬂy report the reconsideration of the cases in Section V for the DALFTI model,

be compared to Fig. 3. Two things should be noted: The results are somewhat clouded
by the presence of the ion temperature disturbance,
Ti, which always exhibits interchange
dynamics due to the fact that the nominal sound wave transit frequency cs/qR is typically
smaller than the dynamical frequencies in the range of 0.2cs/L⊥, so while the interchange
eﬀects are relatively weak compared to the turbulence they are still much stronger than the

the temperature and density gradients. This follows from the fact that more nonadiabatic

electron dynamics in the stronger turbulence for higher collisionality leads to comparatively
stronger eﬀect due to
Te [2,10]. Nevertheless, although the transition regime is wider

slab drift wave turbulence these two quantities control the release of free energy from the
electron thermal gradient and hence play the same role in the turbulence [10]. The fact
that they are less ballooned than the density or ion temperature (or the transport ﬂuxes)
is the reason that drift wave mode structure persists in turbulence in toroidal geometry,
he in the DALF3 model. The arrival of the pure MHD regime for ν = 10 is

W . This adds to the power of the total nonlinear polarisation
and hence the vorticity,
drift and removes the linear forcing terms from dominance at lower collisionality than in
a pure MHD model for which the ion ﬂow is just the ExB ﬂow (cf. also [1]). Tests have
shown that the presence of the nonlinear gyroviscosity has a large eﬀect in the practical
drift wave regime 1 < ν < 5, but we leave the details of this to a subsequent publication
(without the gyroviscosity, the vorticity in Eq. 42 is advected by the total ﬂow expressed
with
W , and there is no correction; in contrast to the actual situation, both energy and
enstrophy are conserved in the case that gyroviscosity is neglected). Due mostly to the

resistive ballooning regime is moved to about

(νB)crit = 0.5

(55)

that is, downward by about a factor of two, generally reﬂecting the equal and additive
eﬀects of the electron and ion pressures.

X. The Ideal Ballooning Boundary

Up to now we have focussed on the comparison between drift wave and resistive
ballooning turbulence, where only the collisionality is varied. The other boundary is better
known: the ideal MHD boundary, which gives the onset of dissipation free ballooning
modes called ideal modes [15]. Experimentally this is thought to give the beta limit, which
is known both globally and locally [42]. In Fig. 23 we show this for both the DALF3 and
DALFTI models, setting ν = 1 to get a sharper transition. The transport is computed as
a ﬂux as before, but this time it is given in terms of the traditional transport coeﬃcients
in physical units — ambiguity with regard to the trend is minimised by choosing all
gradient scale lengths equal to L⊥ and by avoiding the eﬀect of hidden normalisation, as
scs/L⊥ and hence with ( ˆβ/C)1/2 if B and the scale lengths
the diﬀusivities scale with ρ2
are all held ﬁxed. We ﬁnd a clear boundary in both models though it is accentuated by
Ti. The jump in the transport appears at diﬀerent values of ˆβ because the
the presence of
total pressure diﬀers in the models. The standard ideal MHD stability parameter is

e

αM =

(56)

in both physical and normalised units, where the two combinations in parentheses give
pi, respectively, giving a factor of 4 for these parameters for
the normalised
DALFTI and a factor of 1 for DALF3. The transport amplitude is plotted against αM ,
showing that the eﬀective ideal ballooning boundary for the turbulence is given by

pe and

∇

for ˆs = 1. The regime change starts closer to 0.2 but the mode structure changes are
not complete until the longer wavelengths separate from the rest of the dynamics, for αM
about 0.6.

The mode structure changes in the ideal ballooning transition are shown in Figs. 24–
for the DALFTI model, measured in the same

way as in Section V. The signature of the change in character of the turbulence is very
clear in these ﬁgures. When the ideal ballooning takes over, it does so in the longest

wavelengths as their phase shifts separate from the rest of the spectrum. At the same
φ is lost. The signatures of the change
ne and
parameters, the cross coherence between
in character of the turbulence in this transition is sharper and clearer than in the one for

resistive ballooning. All vestige of drift wave character in the cross coherence and parallel

e

e

structure diagnostics is lost when the ideal ballooning boundary is crossed. The phase
shift diagnostic shows that the long wavelength piece splits oﬀ and is no longer inﬂuenced

by the vorticity dynamics coming from the shorter wavelengths, with the result that the

entire spectrum no longer acts as a self consistently causal unit. The same behaviour is

exhibited by both the DALF3 and DALFTI models.

The ideal ballooning cases saturate only by depleting the pressure proﬁle: With pe-

riodic boundary conditions in x these cases do not saturate at all, instead forming a
π where Lx = 2π/AK is the x-
wide jet in the x-direction with kx = 0 and kyLx ≈
domain width. With Dirichlet boundaries the jet becomes a more or less isotropic cell
π/Lx, saturating only as the resulting ﬂux balances the source terms
with kx ≈
maintaining the proﬁle in the edge damping zones. This means that saturation proceeds
only directly on the proﬁle, with the combined action of the nonlinearities unable to suf-

ky ≈

ﬁce.

In no case was the vorticity nonlinearity observed to provide saturation through

Kelvin-Helmholtz eﬀects. This has been found to be a feature of the “thin atmosphere”
1, contrary to other eﬀorts [4] which use A = 1, artiﬁcially
situation with aspect ratio A

constricting the formation of wide down-gradient ﬂows.

XI. Summary — Turbulence in Context

What these results show is that it is important to consider the turbulence in context

when making judgments about its character, especially when in a situation like this there
is more than one possible mode structure into which it can arrange itself. Moreover, it

is essential to set up computations with equal regard for the properties of both or all

the possible eigenmode types, so that the results are not prematurely anticipated. We

ﬁnd that this physical character undergoes strong changes no only in spatial structure
but also in energetics as the linear instability makes the transition into turbulence. Since

the turbulence has no detailed memory beyond several (rather short) correlation times,

the character the dynamics has in the linear stage is not only not relevant, it delivers an
incorrect paradigm as to understanding of the basic nature of the turbulence. This serves

to underscore the danger of relying on linear instability theory in the formative stages of a

28

body of work whose aim is to understand turbulence and transport. The linear instability
is relevant whenever it can act on the longer wavelengths (low k⊥), where the vorticity
1 (i.e., “high-n ballooning”) they lose relevance
nonlinearity is weak, but at high k⊥ρs ∼
because these short wavelength instabilities are superseded by the self sustained drift wave

turbulence. Since this turbulence has an rms vorticity greater than the ideal interchange

growth rate, it scatters the linear eigenmodes apart before they can grow (in analogous

fashion to the way a background ExB vorticity suppresses instabilities).

The important thing to note about these results is that they all speak together; there

are no contradictions.

In all cases, the mode structure for low collisionality and low

beta exhibits clear drift wave character, and the transition to resistive MHD is found
to start for ν > 3, which for this choice of parameters corresponds to ν∗ = 41, where
ν∗ = (qR/τνeVe)ǫ−3/2 and in normalised units ν∗ = ν ˆµ1/2ǫ−3/2 or about 13.6νe and 5.3C
for the nominal scale ratios in Eq. (18), having assumed an inverse aspect ratio of ǫ = 0.3.

Therefore, having examined the properties of the turbulence in its native context, we

can determine where the MHD model begins to be valid, and where we need the drift

wave model not only for computation but for fundamental understanding. Where the

MHD model loses validity due to the adiabatic response becoming important, it also loses

usefulness as a paradigm, because the basic physics of how the disturbances in pressure

and ExB ﬂow communicate undergoes fundamental changes. Generally, MHD character

β

is found when the interchange forcing on the pressure overcomes the adiabatic response.
For ideal MHD the regime boundary is the ballooning limit at the critical value of αM =
q2R
for the particular geometry; in the circular tokamak model it is near (αM )crit = ˆs.
For resistive ballooning the ideal Alfv´en response is replaced by its dissipative MHD limit,
and the boundary is near νB = CωB = 1. The factors of order unity will vary with magnetic
geometry and some of the complications of the temperatures, but generally for the low beta

|∇

|

and moderate collisionality regime in which fusion plasmas are found, one either ﬁnds drift

wave turbulence if the equilibrium is steady, or ideal ballooning phenomena when there

are disruptive events which typically collapse the pressure gradient.

Concerning the situation of linear instabilities vis-a-vis self sustained drift wave tur-

bulence, we ﬁnd a general indication that short wavelength (kyρs
are relevant to the turbulence if and only if their linear growth rates are stronger than
the general diamagnetic vorticity level: γL > ΩD. Long wavelength (kyρs
instabilities, on the other hand, are always relevant because the vorticity nonlinearity is

relatively weak in that spectral range. Borderline cases can only be decided with well

resolved computations assisted by detailed diagnosis.

29

It is important to note that the question of drift wave or ballooning character is one
which is decided by the physical processes responsible for free energy generation, transfer,
and saturation, not by the general look and feel of the turbulence which would be a
very arbitrary issue. The formative literature for both eigenmode types made very clear
statements of what these processes should be, and in order to decide which is most relevant
one must diagnose those processes directly and within the context of the turbulence itself.
It is precisely that which we have done herein.

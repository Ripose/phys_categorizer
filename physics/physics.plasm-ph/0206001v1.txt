Abstract

Keywords : Tokamak, dynamical system, transport barrier, symplectic mappings,
Hamiltonian systems, toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, subdiﬀusion, Cantori, noble numbers,
plasma conﬁnement, scaling laws

Internal transport barriers (ITB’s) observed in tokamaks are described by a purely
magnetic approach. Magnetic line motion in toroidal geometry with broken magnetic
surfaces is studied from a previously derived Hamiltonian map in situation of incomplete
chaos. This appears to reproduce in a realistic way the main features of a tokamak,
for a given safety factor proﬁle and in terms of a single parameter L representing
the amplitude of the magnetic perturbation. New results are given concerning the
Shafranov shift as function of L. The phase space (ψ, θ) of the ”tokamap” describes
the poloidal section of the line trajectories, where ψ is the toroidal ﬂux labelling the
surfaces. For small values of L, closed magnetic surfaces exist (KAM tori) and island
chains begin to appear on rational surfaces for higher values of L, with chaotic zones
around hyperbolic points, as expected. Island remnants persist in the chaotic domain
for all relevant values of L at the main rational q-values.

Single trajectories of magnetic line motion indicate the persistence of a central pro-
tected plasma core, surrounded by a chaotic shell enclosed in a double-sided transport
barrier : the latter is identiﬁed as being composed of two Cantori located on two suc-
cessive ”most-noble” numbers values of the perturbed safety factor, and forming an
internal transport barrier (ITB). Magnetic lines which succeed to escape across this
barrier begin to wander in a wide chaotic sea extending up to a very robust barrier
(as long as L - 1) which is identiﬁed mathematically as a robust KAM surface at the
plasma edge. In this case the motion is shown to be intermittent, with long stages of
pseudo-trapping in the chaotic shell, or of sticking around island remnants, as expected
for a continuous time random walk.

For values of L (cid:23) 1, above the escape threshold, most magnetic lines succeed to
escape out of the external barrier which has become a permeable Cantorus. Statistical
analysis of a large number of trajectories, representing the evolution of a bunch of
magnetic lines, indicate that the ﬂux variable ψ asymptotically grows in a diﬀusive

manner as (L2t) with a L2 scaling as expected, but that the average radial position
rm(t) asymptotically grows as (L2t)1/4 while the mean square displacement around this
average radius asymptotically grows in a subdiﬀusive manner as (L2t)1/2. This result
shows the slower dispersion in the present incomplete chaotic regime, which is diﬀerent
from the usual quasilinear diﬀusion in completely chaotic situations. For physical times
tϕ of the order of the escape time deﬁned by xm(tϕ) ∼ 1, the motion appears to be
superdiﬀusive, however, but less dangerous than the generally admitted quasi-linear
diﬀusion. The orders of magnitude of the relevant times in Tore Supra are ﬁnally
discussed.

Introduction

The ideal picture of perfect axisymmetric magnetic surfaces in a toroidal magnetic con-
ﬁnement device like a tokamak, appears to be strongly modiﬁed either in presence of ﬁeld
inhomogeneities (e.g. divertors) or of tearing instabilities which result in the appearance of
magnetic island chains, with a helical symmetry around the magnetic surfaces. The careful
experimental analysis performed by N.J. Lopes Cardozo et al.
[1], with a very high spa-
tial resolution on electron temperature Te and density ne radial proﬁles [2], up to a few
times the width of an electron banana orbit, has shown that ”small structures appear across
the entire proﬁle, with large magnetic islands occurring when the density disruption limit
is approached” as a result of plasma ﬁlamentation [3]. He concludes that ”the structures
are interpreted as evidence that the magnetic topology in the tokamak discharges is not the
paradigmatic nest of perfect ﬂux surfaces, but more complex than that”. Similar results
have been obtained on the TJ-II stellarator [4] where the very detailed structure of the Te
proﬁle measured along a chord has been observed with a k−4 spectrum .

In presence of several island chains, it is well-known that overlapping may occur [5],
resulting in the appearance of chaotic zones near hyperbolic points, and even chaotic seas
with only island remnants. Equations describing magnetic lines in a torus are expressed in
terms of the toroidal coordinate ζ along the line [6]. This variable ζ is usually interpreted

6

in analogy with a ”time” variable, so that the Hamiltonian equations for magnetic lines
are interpreted as ”equations of motion”. In a situation where island overlapping occurs,
the classical picture describes a given magnetic line as ”percolating” through the plasma,
wandering in the chaotic sea, remaining almost trapped around island remnants (stickiness)
and possibly reaching the plasma edge for increasing values of ζ. In either case, this radial
motion of the perturbed magnetic lines is responsible for an increased transport of particles
and energy, since in the lowest approximation (with vanishing Larmor radii and vanishing
magnetic drifts) charged particles just follow magnetic lines in the real time variable which is
t
ζ in this simple case. In the following description of magnetic lines, we mainly describe
their so-called ”motion”, for simplicity, in spite of the fact that a magnetic line of course
remains static and is just followed in ζ along the toroidal direction.

It is known that a perturbed magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration may sometimes be associated
with the appearance of
transport barriers (TB) characterized by a jump in the slope of
density or temperature proﬁles, and a strong anomalous transport in the outside zone.
TB could also appear in simulations due a strong velocity shear ﬂow (”zonal ﬂows”), even
without magnetic turbulence [7]. In Ref. [2] it is recalled that a strongly reduced ion thermal
conductivity has been obtained in various tokamaks, which remains at the neoclassical level
over part or even the entire plasma. This is due to the presence of an ion TB, associated
with a strong velocity shear and a reduction of the density ﬂuctuation level, which is not the
case for electron TB observed due to the thin structures measured on Te [2]. Such structures
could be associated with alternative layers of good and bad conﬁnement, localized between
local barriers. It is important to stress the fact that transport barriers have been shown to
be coupled to the safety factor proﬁle (q-proﬁle) and to exist also in ohmic plasmas.

Experiments in Tore-Supra, JT-60U, JET, TFTR and other tokamaks (see review in Ref.
[8]) clearly exhibit the inﬂuence of the safety factor proﬁle (q-proﬁle) on the appearance of
internal transport barriers (ITB’s) in tokamaks. For this reason we study here TB in a
purely magnetic description. Electron ITB has been maintained during 2 s. in Tore-Supra
[9]. Generally ITB’s are obtained in presence of a reversed magnetic shear, i.e. with a
q -proﬁle which presents a local maximum near the magnetic axis, and a minimum qmin
typically at a normalized radius of 0.3 - 0.4, and then a regular increase towards the edge
of the plasma. It is generally believed that ITB’s appear around rational q-values, and may
even follow the time-evolution of a given magnetic surface q = 2 for instance in JET [10].
Such ITB’s may have a ﬁnite width and one ﬁnds an ”ITB layer” [11], deﬁned as a thin
layer with large Te gradients [2] inside the ”ITB foot”.

On the other hand, even with a monotonic q -proﬁle , a reduced heat diﬀusivity χ has
been observed in the core region of the plasma, leading to the idea that ITB may appear
even without reversed magnetic shear [12]. This is the simple case we will mainly consider
here.

The experimental observation that ITB appear ”near” rational surfaces may seem sur-
prising from a theoretical point of view. Rational surfaces are not densely covered by mag-
netic lines and thus are the most sensitive ones to plasma instabilities. It is a generic property
that rational surfaces, on which ﬁeld lines close back on themselves after a ﬁnite number
of toroidal turns, are topologically unstable [13].
Irrational surfaces, on the other hand,
are covered by a single magnetic line, in an ergodic way, and appear to be more resistant.
In the same way, the appearance of large scale chaotic motion is described in dynamical
systems theory by successive destructions of KAM tori, and their transformation into per-
meable dense sets, called Cantori. The most resistant KAM torus in a chaotic system is of
course of crucial importance since it is the last inner barrier preventing large scale motion
when the stochasticity parameter is increased. In simple cases it corresponds to a rotational
transform (winding number) given by the ”most irrational” number, the Golden number.
From theoretical grounds, one can thus expect that irrational surfaces are more resistant to

7

chaos [14] and thus more likely to form a transport barrier, if any. In either case, stability
or chaos, the breakup of magnetic surfaces ”is a problem of number theory” [15], as will be
veriﬁed here again.

In the present work we are mainly concerned with the location of ITB’s in a mono-
tonic q-proﬁle which appear naturally in a realistic model for toroidal magnetic lines, called
”tokamap” [16]. The unusual point we ﬁnd here is that the magnetic perturbation, respon-
sible for the appearance of the magnetic island chains, not only creates a non-vanishing
Shafranov shift of the magnetic axis as expected, but also build a locally non-monotonic
q-proﬁle in the equatorial plane, with a spontaneous local maximum qmax on the magnetic
axis, and two local minima. The positions of the ITB found here appear to correspond rather
exactly, in the perturbed q -proﬁle , to ”most noble” values of q which are the ”next most”
irrational numbers beyond the Golden number [17] [18] 1. These will appear to correspond
to the q

position of the internal barriers of the tokamap.

−

It has already been shown that the magnetic surface corresponding to a q-value given
by the golden KAM torus is not the most robust barrier in the tokamap [16].
In other
systems too, the golden mean is not found to be associated with the last KAM curve and
the transition to global stochasticity [19], [20]. Most noble values of q are however the
location where we may expect, from KAM theory [21] that the most robust tori are ﬁnally
destroyed and changed into hardly permeable Cantori, which are thus good candidates to
be identiﬁed with ITB’s. That is what we will check to occur in the tokamap. This result
does not fully agree with the generally admitted idea that ITB’s in tokamaks would always
be associated with rational q-values, but we have to note that the two Cantori forming the
barrier found below are nevertheless observed on both side of a low order rational.

Very interesting theoretical models based on transport across chaotic layers and internal
barriers have been proposed to explain precise measurements performed on the RTP toka-
mak. A model of radial transport in a series of chaotic layers has been developed [22] where
the standard magnetic equilibrium, with monotonously increasing q
proﬁle, is perturbed
by small closed current ﬁlaments: a number of ﬁlaments are localized on low order ratio-
values, with suitably chosen values for their ﬁnite width and current. These current
nal q
ﬁlaments break the topology of nested ﬂux surfaces and are of course responsible for the ap-
pearance of magnetic islands and chaotic regions. Test particle transport is computed and is
found to be subdiﬀusive in such perturbed magnetic ﬁeld, with a mean square displacement
growing like the toroidal angle to the power 1

−

−

2 [63].

A model for inhomogeneous heat transport in a stratiﬁed plasma has also been devel-
oped. Electron heat transport might of course be locally enhanced across each chain of
magnetic islands (corresponding to rational q-value) and this could cause the appearance of
the plateaux observed in the temperature proﬁle [1] at rational q-values, explaining some
jumps in the slope of the temperature proﬁle. Such stochastic zones around low order ratio-
nal chains, could also be limited by permeable Cantori. A simple analysis of heat transport
in an inhomogeneous stratiﬁed medium shows that the measured values may deviate dra-
matically from simple linear averages [1]: the global transport description should take into
account ”insulating” regions but can ignore ”turbulent” regions of high diﬀusivity. In such
models for electron heat transport [23] [24], a number of transport barriers, with suitably
chosen width and local heat conductivity, are assumed to be localized on surfaces with low
values. As a result the large electron heat conductivity, assumed to be
order rational q
constant in the conductivity zone, presents a series of depletions (”q-comb model”). This

model succeeds to reproduce the changes observed in the temperature proﬁle when scanning
the deposition radius ρdep of electron cyclotron heating (ECH) from central to far oﬀ-axis
deposition. The main feature of these measurements [25] is the discontinuous response of
the Te proﬁle to a continuous variation of the deposition radius ρdep: ﬁve plateaux, in which
Te is rather insensitive to changes in ρdep, are separated by sudden transitions occurring for
small changes of ρdep.

In all these models, the perturbations are assumed to be localized around low-order
values, and even if several parameters have to be adjusted, the assumptions of
the

rational q
these successful models are fully compatible [24] with the result obtained here, i.e.
magnetic structure of an ITB as being composed of two noble Cantori.

−

In Section (2) we present this simple Hamiltonian twist map (”tokaMAP” [16]) which
has been proved to describe toroidal magnetic lines in a realistic way for tokamaks.
Its
derivation is summarized. We restrict ourselves mainly to the case of a monotonic q -proﬁle
in the unperturbed conﬁguration. We derive some results concerning the localization of the
ﬁxed points, and determine the Shafranov shift. The bifurcations determining the number
of ﬁxed points are recalled, with an interesting example related to Kadomtsev’s mechanism
of sawtooth instability.

Individual magnetic lines are calculated in Section (3) for very large numbers of iterations,
and a threshold region of the stochasticity parameter L is found, above which most lines from
the central region actually reach the edge of the plasma (global internal chaos). The motion
of a single magnetic line is found to be intermittent, with very long periods of trapping
in diﬀerent regions. The motion can indeed be localized between some layers separated by
Cantori which correspond rather precisely to noble numbers in the proﬁle of the perturbed
q-values around the magnetic axis. The spatial localization of these barriers is discussed in
Section (4). We also present in Section (5) the calculation of the ﬂux through the Cantori
barriers. A Cantorus is a fractal set of points, of fractal dimension zero in the poloidal plane
[26] (or of dimension 1 in the torus: a single magnetic line). Cantori are known to generally
represent local permeable barriers in dynamical systems.

In Section (6) we introduce an set of magnetic lines starting from a very small region
(or a constant initial radius) and perform averages over this ensemble of lines. Iterations
of the tokamap are interpreted in terms of ”time evolution” describing the toroidal motion
of a magnetic line. The average radial motion of the lines is described by calculating the
”time”- dependent average radius and average poloidal ﬂux

The time dependence of these three quantities are analyzed and the existence of an
asymptotic regime is exhibited: in this regime we observe a diﬀusion of the ﬂux coordinate
(the variance grows linearly in time) , but a subdiﬀusion of the spatial motion (the variance

∼

M SDrm(t) grows like t1/2), and a still slower behavior of the average radius, which grows
t1/4. Simple scaling laws are found to describe the dependence
asymptotically like rm(t)
of the corresponding ”diﬀusion” coeﬃcients as function of the stochasticity parameter L. A
quasilinear scaling in L2 is obtained for the ﬂux diﬀusion M SDψ , similarly to what is found
in the standard map [27], [28], for which additional oscillations deeply modify this simple
quadratic growth. As expected, the subdiﬀusive radial motion M SDrm(t) has a coeﬃcient
characterized by a scaling in L1, while the slower radial motion rm(t) is characterized by a
scaling in L1/2.

We ﬁnally discuss the order of magnitude of the relaxation time, the time necessary to
reach this asymptotic regime and discuss which regime could describe the magnetic line
motion before reaching the plasma edge. The conclusions are summarized in Section (7).
Partial results have already been presented in a EPS-ICPP conference and published in [29].

2 Hamiltonian map for toroidal magnetic lines

The unperturbed magnetic ﬁeld realized in tokamaks is ideally represented by a set of nested
toroidal magnetic surfaces wound around a circular magnetic axis. The condition ∇.B = 0
allows us to express the magnetic ﬁeld in the Clebsch form [6] in terms of the dimensionless
toroidal ﬂux ψ and poloidal ﬂux F .

2.1 Equations of motion for magnetic lines

We use traditional toroidal coordinates (ψ, θ, ζ) where θ and ζ are the poloidal and toroidal
angles, respectively, and ψ is the ﬂux coordinate. From (4) the ”equations of motion” for
the magnetic lines are easily derived:

B = ∇ψ

These equations obviously have a Hamiltonian structure: the toroidal angle ζ plays the role
of ”time”, and the poloidal ﬂux F the role of the Hamiltonian.

In the unperturbed case, F is simply a ”surface function” F = F (ψ) which represents
an unperturbed Hamiltonian with one degree of freedom and corresponds to an integrable
system:

When a magnetic perturbation is applied, due to internal factors (instabilities, ﬂuctua-
tions) or to external causes (imperfection, divertor coils...), the poloidal ﬂux F becomes in
general a function of the three coordinates:

2.2 Hamiltonian maps, twist maps and standard map

In order to avoid long symplectic integration in computing the magnetic line motion from
(9), discrete iterative maps have been introduced, specially to study the plasma edge. Many
examples in the literature have been quoted in [16]. An explicit iterative two-dimensional
map consists in discrete transformations of the form

ψν+1 = P (ψν, θν )

,

θν+1 = Θ(ψν , θν)

(10)

where ν is a non-negative integer which represents physically the number of large turns
around the torus, and where the functions P (ψν, θν ) and Θ(ψν, θν) are explicit in the ”pre-
vious” values ψν and θν .

Such transformations must of course conserve the Hamiltonian structure of the equations
(9) : the model should be a Hamiltonian map (i.e. area-preserving or symplectic) and
therefore the transformation (10) has to be a canonical transformation of the canonical
variables (ψ, θ).
In order to derive the map, one thus introduces a general generating
function F (ψν+1, θν) which allows to write down the map as

ψν =

∂ F (ψν+1,θν )
∂θν

,

θν+1 =

∂ F (ψν+1,θν )
∂ψν+1

(11)

which is in an implicit form. (Note that we choose here a generating function of the new
momentum ψ and the old angle θ, but the inverse choice is also possible and would lead to
another family of maps).

Other choices are possible for the same twist map, for instance with another kind of
generating function Fa(θν , θν+1) called the action generating function used in Section (5),
from which the map can be written as

ψν =

−

∂ Fa(θν ,θν+1)
∂θν

, ψν+1 = ∂ Fa(θν ,θν+1)

∂θν+1

The relation between F and Fa is thus (from (11) and (12)):

Fa(θν, θν+1) = ψν+1(θν, θν+1).θν+1 −

F

ψν+1(θν , θν+1), θν

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(see Ref. [30]).

2.2.1 General form of a twist map

In order to proceed, the following general form of the generating function has been chosen:

F (ψν+1, θν) = ψν+1.θν + F0(ψν+1) + L δF (ψν+1, θν)

(14)

where L is the perturbation parameter and F0(ψν+1) the unperturbed term taking into
account the winding number (see(7))

(12)

(13)

(15)

W (ψ) =

∂F0(ψ)

∂ψ ≡

1
q(ψ)

11

As a consequence of (11) the map takes the following form

ψν+1 = ψν + L h(ψν+1, θν)

θν+1 = θν + W (ψν+1) + L j(ψν+1, θν )

which is an Hamiltonian form because the two functions h and j deﬁned by

h(ψν+1, θν) =

∂ δF (ψν+1,θν )
∂θν

−

,

j(ψν+1, θν) =

∂ δF (ψν+1,θν )
∂ψν+1

automatically insure that

∂ h(ψν+1, θν)
∂ ψν+1

+

∂ j(ψν+1, θν)
∂ θν

= 0

Equations (16) has the form of a general Hamiltonian map, from which simple cases can be
recovered.

When variables are clearly separated in (16) i.e.

for h = h(θν) and j = j(ψν+1) one
ﬁnds a general twist map in the case where the proﬁle q(ψ) is monotonous (see section 5.1
below).

2.2.2 The standard map

h(θ) =

j(ψ) = 0 , W (ψ) = ψ

These last two maps are actually not suitable to represent magnetic lines in a tokamak
r2 remains nonnegative after
ﬁrst because they do not insure that a nonnegative value of ψ
iteration (as it should to represent a real value of the radial position) and, second, because
they do not involve any realistic proﬁle of the winding number W (ψ) (they correspond to a q
1/r2). In order to satisfy these two necessary properties,

2.3 The tokamap

A speciﬁc model, the ”tokamap” has been derived in [16] from general properties of Hamil-
tonian twist maps. The advantage consists in succeeding to describe the whole body of
a tokamak plasma, including chains of magnetic islands in a realistic way. This map de-
scribes the basic motion of the magnetic lines in the two dimensional poloidal plane (ψ, θ)
by the winding number W (ψ) which is here modiﬁed by an additional contribution from the
magnetic perturbation.

The general expression of the tokamap results from the following choice in the generating

function (14) :

δF (ψν+1, θν ) =

cos 2πθν (tokamap)

which involves an additional ψ dependence as compared to Eq.(26). We thus consider the

This explicit map (31-34) has been shown to be compatible with minimal toroidal geometry
requirements. The polar axis (ψ = 0) represents the magnetic axis in the unperturbed
conﬁguration. This map depends on one parameter, the stochasticity parameter L (2), and
on one arbitrary function W (ψ) which is chosen according to the q -proﬁle we want to
represent. For increasing values of L, chaotic regions appear mostly near the edge of the
plasma.

It is a simple matter to check that the symmetries of the tokamap imply that, for negative
values of L, the phase portrait is the same as for positive values, but with the simple poloidal
translation : θ
θ + 1/2 which means that the original phase portrait for θ = 0 to 1 is
⇒
recovered identically but for θ =

1/2 to +1/2 .

−

It has been shown that, contrary to what occurs in the Chirikov-Taylor standard map
[27] or even in the Wobig map [31], a nonnegative value of ψ always yields a nonnegative
iterated value, insuring that the radius remains a real number (see Eq.(123)). In the domain
L < 1, however, the Wobig map also conserves nonnegativity of ψ .

The tokamap has recently been deduced in a very diﬀerent way [32], as a particular case
of a particle map describing guiding centre toroidal trajectories in a perturbed magnetic
ﬁeld given in general by (4), and to lowest order by the standard magnetic ﬁeld model [33],
[34]:

B =

B0
1 + εT x cos θ

eζ + εT

(cid:20)

x
q(x)

eθ

(cid:21)

where εT = a/R0 is the inverse aspect ratio of the torus, R0 the large radius of the torus,
B0 the magnetic ﬁeld strength on the axis and x = ρ/a the normalized radial coordinate of
the plasma of small radius a . This magnetic ﬁeld (35) is checked to be divergenceless. By
comparing the poloidal ﬂux expressions in the general Clebsch formula (4) and in the above
standard model (35), it is easy to deduce that the toroidal ﬂux ψ in this case is given by

(35)

(36)

in the dimensionless units used in the tokamap.

ψ =

x2
2

In [32] canonical coordinates for guiding centre have been derived, allowing for the sym-
plectic integration of the equations of motion and the derivation of a Hamiltonian map
for guiding centre in a perturbed toroidal geometry. As a particular case, the tokamap is
deduced from this particle map when one applies a simple m = 0 nonresonant magnetic
perturbation. In order to describe magnetic line motion only, the magnetic moment is con-
sidered to be zero, and one keeps terms to the lowest order in the inverse aspect ratio εT .
Moreover, in order to go from the time dependence of the particle trajectory to the toroidal
ζ-dependence of the position (ψ, θ) of the magnetic line, all equations are simply divided
by the equation for ∂ζ/∂t . As a result, Eqs.(31-34) are exactly recovered. This deriva-
tion also allows to write down explicitly the form of the magnetic perturbation involved in
the tokamap : The generating function (14) takes into account a magnetic divergence-free
perturbation δB with the following components:

dullaev [35].

2.3.1 Safety factor proﬁle

In order to take magnetic shear into account, a speciﬁc q -proﬁle has to be introduced to
describe the unperturbed equilibrium. We consider here the same proﬁle as in Ref. [16] :

q(ψ) =

4
ψ).(2

−

w.(2

−

2ψ + ψ2)

which corresponds to a classical cylindrical equilibrium [36] in which the value on the axis
(ψ = 0) is given by the parameter w :

and on the edge (ψ = 1) by :

q(ψ = 0) =

1
w

q(ψ = 1) = 4q(0)

which is four times the central value. The derivation of this q -proﬁle (39) is presented in
Appendix A.

2.3.2 One example with reversed magnetic shear : the ”Rev-tokamap”

If a non monotonic q -proﬁle is used instead, a reversed magnetic shear is introduced in
the unperturbed magnetic ﬁeld, and it has been shown that the above mapping becomes a
nontwist map : this ”Rev-tokamap” [37] has very diﬀerent properties namely because the
Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem does not apply anymore. It has been found [37]
that a critical surface appears in the plasma near the minimum of the q -proﬁle , separating
an external, globally stochastic region from a central, robust nonstochastic core region. Such
a phenomena of ”semiglobal chaos” has been shown to be analogous to the appearance of
ITB in reversed shear experiments. Later, similar theoretical results have been obtained in
the Lausanne group [38] in a reversed shear TEXTOR equilibrium; by studying a symplectic
perturbed map for the magnetic topology, they conﬁrmed that the transport barrier is indeed
localized near the minimum of the q -proﬁle .

Coming back on the reversed shear model of Ref.

[37] we will show below in Section
(4.5.2) that the ITB found in that work is also localized with a good precision on a q-value
which will appear to be a noble number.

2.3.3 Fixed points and bifurcations

The general structure of the phase portrait of the tokamap has been described in detail in
[16]. Fixed points of the map should not be confused with secondary magnetic axes inside
the islands: the latter are not ﬁxed but wander upon iteration from one island to another
island of the chain and appear as periodic points.

Fixed points, deﬁned by ψν+1 = ψν and θν+1 = θν + n where n is an integer, can
easily be calculated by using ﬁrst Eq. (31) which yields either ψ = 0 (the polar axis) or
sin(2πθν ) = 0. This proves that all ﬁxed points are either

- on the polar axis ( ψ = 0), for instance θ = 0.25 and 0.75 which are two hyperbolic

points on the polar axis, and exist as long as L < 1,

- or in the equatorial plane (θ = 0 or 0.5). By using next Eq. (32), one ﬁnds that the

values of ψ at the ﬁxed points with θ = 0 are solutions of

It has been shown [16] that the origin, the polar axis (ψ = 0) is a ﬁxed point as long
as L < 1. Fixed points have been discussed in great detail in [16], including consideration
of the ”ghost space” ψ < 0 which appears necessary in order to check that the Poincar´e-
Birkhoﬀ theorem and the conservation of stability index (the diﬀerence between the number
of elliptic and hyperbolic points which remains constant as w varies) are indeed satisﬁed.
Let us simply recall here that bifurcations occur according to the value of w representing
the central winding number (see 40) as compared to the following L-dependent parameters

and

wM (L) = 2

−

As long as w < wm = 1
L, the only invariant point is the polar axis ψ = 0, which obviously
has to be interpreted in this case as the magnetic axis of the tokamak (see Fig. 15 in [16]).

−

For higher values of w, when wm < w < wM ≡

L < w < 1 + L, a ﬁrst
bifurcation has occurred, with the appearance of an elliptic point oﬀ the polar axis. This
latter elliptic point has to be interpreted as the magnetic axis, displaced by the Shafranov
shift [39], [40]. In the case w = 1 (to which we will restrict ourselves in the next Sections),
the position ψMA of this magnetic axis is obtained by using Eq. (43) as function of L as:

wm , i.e. 1

F2(ψMA, L, w = 1, n = 1) = 0

(46)

The curve giving ψ = ψMA(K = 2πL) is plotted in Fig.(1).

In the absence of any perturbation (L = 0), the magnetic surfaces are centered around

the polar axis.

A ﬁrst typical phase portrait is given in Fig. 5 of Ref.

[16] for the simple case where
q(0) = 1, and L = 4.5/2π
0.716 , hence w = 1 and wm < w. One can see the formation
of a chaotic belt which surrounds several large islands chains. This belt is clearly conﬁned
between two surfaces which were interpreted as KAM surfaces in this case. Several other
examples are given below (see Figs.2-5). We will discuss why, for slightly higher values of L,
such boundary surfaces can be identiﬁed as fractal barriers or Cantori, which can be crossed
by a magnetic line after a very long time.

4.875/2π) = 0.07492 . Here r = √ψ represents the radial coordinate, with r = √2 on the
edge.

2.3.4 Second bifurcation for q(0) < 1

A second bifurcation occurs for still higher values of w when wm < wM < w, i.e. when
1 + L < w which implies q(0) < 1 : the magnetic axis remains displaced from the origin
and corresponds to the center of a m = 1 island in the equatorial plane at θ = 0.5, resulting
in the appearance of an hyperbolic point (”X point”) for θ = 0 with a separatrix enclosing
the origin. The latter appears to be the ”main” magnetic axis, ”expelled” by the presence
of the m = 1 island. This can be seen in Fig.(2) which presents the tokamap phase portrait
for L = 1/4π, w = 1.05 (thus q(0) < 1 and wm < w) over N = 8193 iterations.

This example shows the ﬁnal situation after a big island (m = 1) has grown and expelled
a small region around the original magnetic axis near the polar axis; this occurs when the
unperturbed q-value on the axis is smaller than unity, q(0) = 1/w < 1, allowing for the
existence of a surface q = 1 inside the plasma. It has been stressed that this process occurs
as a result of a reconnection of magnetic lines, and is typical of Kadomtsev’s theory of
sawtooth instabilities. The position of the m = 1 magnetic axis (”O point”), as well as the
position of the hyperbolic X point can be calculated analytically from Eqs. (42, 43), in
[16]. (We note that two misprints appeared in the text
agreement with Fig. 17 of Ref.
of that paper for the exact numerical values which should be written ψ1 = 0.040 of the O
point, and ψ2 = 0.024 of the X point, as indicated by the Fig. 17, instead of 0.179 and 0.167
written in the main text).

These points can be calculated as follows. For wM < w the position ψH of the hyperbolic
X point is given by the solution of F1(ψH , L, w, 1) = 0 (with θ = 0) as deﬁned in Eq. (42).
For a given w, this solution exists only for the smaller values of L. For instance for w = 1.05
it exists only for K = 2πL
1.97392 , which means that for q(0) < 1 this X point only
appears for small values of the perturbation parameter.

The polar axis (0, 0) is the main magnetic axis of the plasma core. The position of the
elliptic point in the m = 1 island is ψ = 0.040246, θ = 0.5 and the hyperbolic point is

⇒

The position ψE of the m = 1 magnetic axis (elliptic or O point) is given by the solution of
F2(ψE, L, w, 1) = 0 (with θ = 0.5). We remark that this last solution ψE(L) does not vanish
for L
0, which would seem to indicate the existence of a ﬁxed point [ψE(L = 0), θ = 0.5]
out of the polar axis ψ = 0, even in the unperturbed case where all magnetic surfaces are
circles centered around the origin... In this case we have wM (L = 0) = 1 < w which means
q(0) < 1 and this ﬁxed point [ψE(L = 0), θ = 0.5] is simply a standard point of the circular
surface q = 1 : this is just a special feature of this unperturbed surface on which every point
appears as stationary since it exactly comes back after one toroidal rotation (one iteration).
This speciﬁc point with θ = 0.5 in the unperturbed case is however important since it acts
as a seed for the m = 1 island which appears when L becomes diﬀerent from zero. We note
that this position ψE(L) is such that q(ψE(L = 0)) = 1.

In order to simplify the discussion about dispersive motion of the magnetic lines in the

tokamap, we will restrict ourselves in the following Sections to the case

w = 1

(47)

which means q(0) = 1 . The unperturbed q -proﬁle is a continuous and monotonous function,
with a value growing from 1 in the center to 4 on the edge of the plasma, a rather standard

proﬁle in most ohmic discharges.

Individual trajectories: tokamap phase space portrait

In this section we ﬁrst present the phase portrait of the tokamap in the case w = 1, q(0) = 1
for increasing values of the stochasticity parameter and then study very long trajectories.

3.1

Increasing stochasticity

For increasing values of the stochasticity parameter the tokamap exhibits all the main fea-
tures of chaotic systems, in a way which is very realistic for tokamaks.

3.1.1 Weak stochasticity regime : conﬁnement by KAM tori

For small values of the stochasticity parameter L = K/2π << 1, most of the KAM surfaces
are preserved and the phase portrait of the tokamap appears to be described by embedded
tori, around a magnetic axis displaced from the origin (ψ = 0, θ = 0) by the Shafranov shift
(46), as seen in Fig.(3).

In this case all magnetic lines remain conﬁned, no magnetic island is seen. From the
position of the shifted magnetic axis, we note that, for positive values of L, the weak ﬁeld
side of the torus is in the direction θ = 0.5 .

3.1.2 Appearance of island chains on rational q-values

For an increased value of L, regular chains of magnetic islands appear; their number m and
the order in which these islands are visited by a magnetic line allow us to deduce their q-value
in a simple way. For instance a chain of m islands visited one by one at each iteration, in the
direction of increasing values of θ, has a rotational transform or winding number ι(ψ)/2π
equal to 1/m, and a q-value q = m. These are the main island chains, as seen in Fig.(4).

A direct measurement of the exact value of q can be performed, specially for almost
undestroyed magnetic surfaces, by computing the average winding number along a trajectory,

a change of coordinate is necessary to evaluate correctly the rotation around the magnetic
axis. On the other hand, for all surfaces encircling the polar axis, the knowledge of the
iterated values θτ allows us to calculate the following surface quantity (average on a given

The main rational chains q = 3/2, 2, 3 and 4 are partly stochastized.

We show on Fig.(6) a small part of the phase portrait obtained by following 6 trajectories
along 16 380 iterations: the main chain of primary islands is observed, with intermediate
higher rational chains, surrounded by stochastic regions in the vicinity of the hyperbolic
points (as usual in nonlinear dynamical systems).

3.1.4 Island remnants in the chaotic sea

The general aspect of the phase portrait is determined mainly by the q -proﬁle . The
structure of the stochastic sea is analyzed in terms of the various island chains. The islands
are partly ”destroyed” by chaotic regions on their edge, so that we mainly observe ”island
remnants” which form a ”skeleton” of the phase space. Several island chains among the
largest, which belong to the ”dominant” classes n = m and n = m

are represented in Fig.(7). This skeleton structure is then invaded by the chaotic sea (not

- a stochastized region around the [m = 9, q = 9/8] island remnants,
- and also [m = 12, q = 12/11 = 1.09].
All these chains are seen to encircle both the magnetic axis and also the polar axis (since
they cover the whole interval of θ). We also represented two chains encircling the magnetic

From the respective positions of the two latter chains, we note the unexpected fact
that, locally, the perturbed q-value is actually growing towards the magnetic axis, a very
important feature for transport properties. This proves that a non-monotonous q -proﬁle
around the magnetic axis, and a negative magnetic shear has been spontaneously created by
the magnetic perturbation. The precise perturbed q -proﬁle is presented below in Section
4.5 (see Figs.19, 20 ).

3.1.5 Good conﬁnement of the plasma core

Between these island remnants are large chaotic regions. Of particular interest is a circular
chaotic shell (or belt) around the magnetic axis. For instance with L = 5.5/2π
0.875
we have represented in Fig.(8) several trajectories ﬁlling a circular shell surrounding the
magnetic axis, and wandering in a chaotic layer around island remnants. We stress the fact
that this chaotic central shell surrounds a regular central part (around the magnetic axis),
which represents a quiet central plasma core protected from chaos, thus a good conﬁnement
zone.

We note that the chaotic zone represented here has an obvious internal separation, with a

visible trajectory passing very near r

hyperbolic point [16]. The separation is actually nothing else than the chaotized separatrix
in the (ψ, θ) plane, joining the two hyperbolic points located in ψ = 0, θ = 0.25 and 0.75.
In a polar representation this separatrix is the circular magnetic ”surface” encircling the
magnetic axis and tangent to the polar axis ψ = 0.

3.1.6 Stochasticity threshold for escaping lines out of the plasma bulk

The aim of the present work consists, ﬁrst, to determine, for a given q -proﬁle , the threshold
domain of the values of the stochasticity parameter L for which the plasma boundary be-
comes permeable, allowing the magnetic line to escape across this broken barrier to the edge
and corresponding to a disruption of the plasma towards the wall. This happens between
0.796. The next question is (see Sections 4.1 and
L = 4.875/2π
4.3) : for lower values of L, in the conﬁnement domain, which is the most robust barrier
able to inhibit the motion of the magnetic lines up to the edge ? In other words : which is
the most robust KAM surface inside the plasma, the last one to be broken ? Which is its q
value ?

0.776 and L = 5/2π

∼

For L = 6/2π we remark that the edge of the plasma has become permeable and is
strongly deformed as compared to the unperturbed circle ψ = 1. The four islands q = m = 4
can be seen on Fig.(9), along with their four satellites or ”daughter islands”. This value of
the stochasticity parameter is obviously larger than that of an escape threshold.

∼
After a long trapping period in the chaotic sea, this trajectory ﬁnally escapes out of the
plasma edge. The initial conditions are r = √2ψ = 0.4 and θ = 0.025..

By performing a very long iteration up to 2.109 time steps on a Alpha workstation, with
a value L = 4.875/2π
0.776, we did not reach the time where the particle could possibly
escape from the plasma : up to this time the trajectory remains conﬁned by what can be
considered as a KAM surface.

∼

On the other hand, for slightly larger values of L of the order of 5/2π

0.796, most of
the magnetic lines are found to rapidly escape from the plasma (see for instance Fig.(10)
0.875). A threshold region of the stochasticity parameter has thus been

3.2 Intermittent motion inside the conﬁned plasma: crossing inter-

nal barriers

For values of L smaller than this escape threshold, magnetic lines are wandering inside
the plasma. We mainly consider here the case L = 4.875/2π
0.776 at which the edge
barrier is not yet broken. We follow one single magnetic line along a large number of
iterations, starting near the central region. With this value of the stochasticity parameter,
the corresponding phase portrait is particularly rich, even with only one point represented

The chaotic sea is represented on the Fig.(11) where we recognize the protected zones
corresponding to the island remnants with q = 4, 3, 2 and 1 (the central core) beside all
other main rational chains.

For this trajectory the sticking stage is particularly long around the boundary of the
q = 5/2 island remnant, and lasts for several 108 iterations. Starting from points in the
neighborhood, and performing a small number of iterations (N = 16380) we ﬁnd that this
dense stochastic zone takes a ﬁgure-eight form (which indicates that a period doubling has
occurred) with 9 daughter islands around (see Fig.(12)). Each of the central elliptic points
in these q = 5/2 islands has already bifurcated, giving rise to an inverse hyperbolic point
and to two new elliptic points.

It is most interesting to determine the time behavior of the magnetic line position in
its complicated motion across the chaotic sea of the poloidal plane. The full information

stroboscopic eﬀects (by using any multiple of 5 for instance we would have drawn only one of the ﬁve islands
q = 5/2 since the same magnetic line visits the neighborhood of these ﬁve islands one after the other - two
by two - and comes back in the ﬁrst island neighborhood after 5 iterations. In order to represent the whole
set of 5 daughter islands around the two islands q = 2 we need to avoid multiples of 10, a.s.o... so that we
choose a large prime number).

has been represented on an animated movie [41]. We have followed a very long trajectory
on 2.109 time steps starting from ψ = 0.0136125, θ = 0.033. As discussed in Appendix
A (Eq. (123)), this initial condition corresponds to a radius r = 0.165 , slightly out of
the central protected core of the plasma (we recall that in these notations, the edge of the
plasma ψ = 1 is at r = √2 ). From such initial conditions, the road is completely open up
to the edge of the plasma, which is a resistant KAM barrier for this L value, but the path is
far from trivial: the magnetic line describes a path ”percolating” among the rich variety of
island remnants which are known to form a hierarchical fractal structure. In that movie one
remarks that the line remains for a very long ”time” in a chaotic layer, between the central
protected core and some visible transport barrier ”around” q = 9/8, and then crosses this
barrier to explore the upper chaotic sea (extending up to the plasma edge). Such transitions
across the barrier occur repeatedly, inward and outward, in an intermittent way and after
random residence times. Shorter periods of sticking inside this barrier are also observed.

This behavior can also be represented in a (r, t) graph shown in Fig.(13) where we present
the time variation of the radial position : this behavior is not only stochastic, but presents
diﬀerent stages :

- a ﬁrst period of pseudo-trapping or temporary conﬁnement in an inner shell below

r - 0.6,

island remnants, up to r - 1.6,

- an escape in an external shell, and a wandering stage in a wide chaotic sea, avoiding

- a period of deep sticking around the ﬁve island remnants q = 5/2 (only four bands can

be seen since two of the ﬁve islands overlap in radius),

- a new wandering in the chaotic sea of the external shell, then a second stage of pseudo-

trapping in the inner shell,

- and so one and so forth...
In other words the oscillating radial position of a single line is seen to wander randomly
from the (inner) stochastic shell, to the stochastic sea (sometimes around q = 5/2 island
remnants) with small downward peaks indicating excursion towards and inside the transport
barrier, like ﬂood tide and ebb tide.

Such an intermittent behavior is typical of the phenomena of alternative trapping into
diﬀerent ”basins” of a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) [42], as previously observed
[43] in a stochastic layer of the Chirikov-Taylor standard map. One may wonder why these
average residence times (trapping times) are so long in the present case. This could be
related with the fact that the value L = 4.875/2π considered in Fig.(13) is not far from the
escape threshold L
5/2π, and that the latter could be the analogous of a critical point
of percolation, in the vicinity of which cluster lengths and diﬀusion characteristic times are
generally diverging as some inverse power of the deviation from the critical parameter value,
with a critical exponent.

∼

This conjecture however remains to be proved. In the present problem, such long char-
acteristic times seem to exclude the possibility to compute the histogram (the probability
distribution of these residence times), which would need awfully long iterations times in
order to obtain a good statistics.

4 Localization of transport barriers

The intermittent motion described in Fig.(13) clearly exhibits intermittent periods of con-
ﬁned motion between structures playing the role of internal transport barriers (ITB), the
most resistant curves inside the conﬁned plasma. It is interesting to identify such barriers
and to note their positions along the q -proﬁle .

diﬀerent stages of trapping in diﬀerent zones indicate an intermittent behaviour. Note that
trapping stages are very long at may last for at least several 107 iterations for this value of
the stochasticity parameter, near the escape threshold. (Such long times near the critical
threshold for large scale chaotic motion could be reminiscent of critical phenomena.

4.1 Rough localization

4.1.1 Central core barrier

An initial period of pseudo trapping is observed, during which the trajectory remains in the
inner shell of Fig.(11) for several 106 iterations. This shell is separated from the protected
central core of the plasma by a very strong barrier on the plasma edge which has not been
crossed during 2.109 iterations. This barrier can thus be considered as a KAM torus (or
a very robust Cantorus if it could have been crossed by performing still more iterations).
By analyzing the innermost points reached by the long trajectory, and performing short
iteration series on several of them, we can determine which part of the trajectory is a good
candidate to localize the barrier. A rational estimate of the value of the safety factor can be
determined on this trajectory by carefully analyzing the (almost) periodic repetition of the
variation of the poloidal angle θ in time, along with an estimation of the average poloidal
rotation at each iteration, or by a direct calculation of the winding number (48) after a
possible change of coordinates for innermost trajectories not encircling the origin. We ﬁnd
that a very rough estimate of the inner barrier protecting the plasma core from invasion
from the inner shell is characterized by:

4.1.2 Internal barrier preventing outward motion in the chaotic shell (lower

Cantorus)

In this inner shell, the outward motion is limited by a series of points which has been
analyzed in a similar way. Measurement of the q-value of the outermost trajectory in a
short sample yields the following rough rational estimate:

4.1.3 External barrier on the plasma edge

The upper edge of the chaotic sea in Fig.(11) has also been analyzed in a similar way.
Iteration of some of the outermost points allows us to draw Fig.(14) which allows us to
select a good candidate for the most external local trajectory. The determination of a
rational approximate for its q-value yields:

For this external barrier we have successively identiﬁed on Fig.(14) surfaces with q = 13/3,
35/8 and the outermost one : q = 92/21. Of course a still better precision is possible, but
this is enough for the present purpose.

4.1.4 Internal barrier preventing inward motion in the chaotic sea: a two-sided

internal barrier (upper Cantorus)

During long intermediate stages in the intermittent history of Fig.(13), the trajectory re-
mains above what appears as an internal barrier preventing the inner motion. A similar
analysis allows us to determine a rough rational approximate for the q-value of the inner-
most part of this trajectory:

which appear to be diﬀerent from the neighboring surface qC2 preventing upward motion
from the inner shell. We are thus in presence of a two-sided transport barrier. It is quite
remarkable that both sides could have been distinguished. Actually this diﬀerence clearly
appears to the eyes on the movie [41] which has been realized on this simulation, in which we
present a succession of snapshots to which new groups of points are added in a discontinuous
way on each new picture : it can clearly be observed on some pictures how new, ”fresh” or
”recent” points are really aligned along a barrier which is diﬀerent from the lower one. One
of these snapshots is presented in Fig.(15).

4.2 Expectations from theory of nonlinear dynamical systems

From classical theory of chaos in simple nonlinear dynamical systems [14], it is expected
that the most resistant KAM torus in a q
interval of values is either the Golden number or
at least a ”noble” number (after Percival [17]) . This is known to be the case in the standard
map. When represented in a continuous fraction expansion

−

[a1, a2, a3, ...., aj] = 1/ (a2 + 1/ (a3 + 1/... + 1/aj))

(54)

the Golden number has a simple [(1, )

] coding:

and other noble numbers have a (1, )
tail, with other integers before. Most noble numbers
are the ”most irrational”, deﬁned as those with the smallest number of integers before the

35

∞

(1, )

tail.

In presence of magnetic shear the situation can be diﬀerent: for instance, to the best
of our knowledge, nobody knows why the Golden number actually plays no special role in
the tokamap with monotonous q -proﬁle [16]. In other words, the special role played by the
Golden KAM in the standard map does not seem to be conserved in other maps in presence
of shear. We denote the most noble numbers of interest here by

N (1, 1). For i = 1 we note that these noble numbers are ”good milestones” in the q
-proﬁle since they are rather well distant, and even of measure zero [18]. It is simple to
prove that the values of N (1, j) are actually inserted in the q -proﬁle between successive
dominant island chains Q(j)

1) since it is easy to demonstrate that:

j/(j

≡

−

Q(1 + j) > N (1, j) > Q(2 + j)

(57)

Better and better rational approximants to a noble number ω (in the sense of the Diophan-
tine approximation) are obtained by truncating this inﬁnite series at a higher and higher
level : these rational approximants are known to converge towards the noble number ω
and are called the ”convergents”, with the property ”to be the closest rational to the irra-
tional ω, compared to rationals with the same or smaller denominator” [14]. The successive
convergents to an irrational number

ω = [a1, a2, a3, ...., aj,...]

(58)

are deﬁned by (see (54)) the series :

[a1]

[a1, a2] = a1 + 1

etc...

(59)

When looking at the most noble q

q1 = m1/n1 (with
is

m0n1 −
|

values in any given interval between q0 = m0/n0 and
= 1 [4]), it is known [44] that the most irrational number

−

α1 =

m0 + G.m1
n0 + G.n1

(60)

and is expected to correspond to the most robust barrier in that interval. If we now look
at the successive intervals
between the main rational chains of the
dominant series q = Q(m + 1) = (m + 1)/m (as observed in Fig.(11), we see that these
intervals are Farey intervals [45] covering the real axis and the most noble q
values in each
of these intervals are precisely given by Eq. (56) :

4As a direct consequence of this fundamental recurrence relation for continued fractions, this relation
simply expresses the fact that the two limits m0/n0 and m1/n1of the considered interval are actually two
successive convergents (or approximants) of some continued fraction.

Figure 16: Farey tree indicating how the most noble number in a given interval between
rationals (10/9 and 9/8, or 9/8 and 8/7) can be built with results N (1, 8) or N (1, 7).

(where we used G + 1 = G2). These most noble numbers are not frequent and simply alter-
nate with the main rational chains. In the barrier found ”around” q = 9/8 the candidates
for robust circles are thus q = N (1, 7) and N (1, 8) since we have 8/7 > N (1, 7) > 9/8 >
N (1, 8) > 10/9.

It is worth mentioning that the convergents towards these two noble numbers are, for

where successive approximants are alternatively from below and from above, due to the

series in the Farey coding [45], see Fig.(16).

It is well known that the numerators and denominators pµ of the successive approximants
actually grow as a Fibonacci series pµ+2 = pµ+1 + pµ, with an asymptotic growth rate
limλ→∞ pµ+1/pµ = G given by the golden number G.

In Fig.(17), we have plotted a series of 2046 iterations along the island chains with
rational q-values corresponding to the following approximants to the upper Cantorus (63) :
q = 17/15, 43/38 and 112/99 from above, and q = 9/8, 26/23 and 69/61 from below. This
allows us to localize the upper Cantorus on this graph as being located in the very thin
interval located between bold dots.

Figure 17: The upper Cantorus for L = 4.875/2π can be localized in the central region,

Cantorus N (1, 7) : q = 17/15, 43/38 and 112/99 from above, and q = 9/8, 26/23 and 69/61

4.3 Identiﬁcation of ”convergents” towards these most noble Can-

tori

It is simple but numerically delicate to check that the barrier is composed of two Cantori
localized precisely on these two most noble numbers : a lower Cantorus on N (1, 8) and an
upper Cantorus on N (1, 7). Why are the most resistant KAM tori located around q = 9/8
for this value of L could probably not be deduced on theoretical grounds. Of course, beside
the most robust barrier described here, other, less robust barriers also exist. A detailed
analysis of the various thin downward peaks in Fig.(13) reveals that the lower boundary of
the magnetic line motion in the stochastic sea is actually oscillating in time, and does not
always correspond to the same upper Cantorus above the island chain q = 9/8 as deﬁned in
Eq. (63). The lower boundary of the stochastic sea can be found on diﬀerent Cantori located
most often above the island chain q = 6/5, but also on the Cantori above q = 7/6 and 8/5.
This seems to indicate that a global barrier could rather be composed of diﬀerent sticking
values, and that these sticking regions
regions around island chains with main rational q
are limited successively by the Cantori between them, in some kind of cascading process.
Global motion in these boundary regions could then be described [41] as a succession of
approaches, like ﬂood tide and ebb tide, allowing the magnetic line to pass through the
successive barriers.

−

During the upward motion starting from the chaotic layer, the most important barrier
(but not the last one) nevertheless remains the upper Cantorus q = N (1, 7) above the
islands q = 9/8 : once this one has been passed, the magnetic line rapidly invades the whole
chaotic sea. As seen in Fig.(13), the inverse, downward motion from the chaotic sea however
encounters several barrier crossing, back and forth, before crossing the upper Cantorus and
entering in the zone between the two Cantori composing the ITB described in this paper.

4.3.1 Convergent island chains towards the two Cantori

Localization of island chains with given q
value can be obtained numerically with great
precision by searching hyperbolic and/or elliptic periodic points, by a numerical algorithm
derived from a generalization of the Fletcher-Reeves method, involving the Jacobi matrix of
the tokamap, explained in Appendix B. Localizing the position of a noble Cantorus can
only be achieved as a limiting procedure, by localizing the series of its convergents, as given
by Eqs. (62, 63).

−

In order to check the above predictions we have sampled (in a very long trajectory of 2.109
values in the chaotic
iterations) various sections of trajectory (a) reaching the highest ψ
shell (below the lower Cantorus), and (b) reaching the lowest ψ
values in the chaotic sea
(above the upper Cantorus): such trajectories remain indeed well separated, by the width
of the barrier. Then we have checked that any of these sections of trajectory (a) remains
indeed below the limit of convergence of N (1, 8) of the lower Cantorus, more precisely below
the limit of the convergents from below :

In other words we have checked that observed trajectories in the chaotic shell and in the
chaotic sea remain actually always on their own side of the pair of Cantori, which localizes
the barrier.

4.3.2 Convergent island chains towards noble KAM’s on the edge and around

the plasma core

By the same method we have also identiﬁed the q
value of the robust boundary circle
forming the plasma edge as being equal to N (4, 2) which appears to be the most irrational
between q = 4 and q = 4.5, according to Eq. (60) :

] = N (4, 2) = 4.381 <

(66)

in agreement with (52). There should probably exist a stronger barrier out of the ”plasma
edge” on N (4, 1)
4.618, but this one remains out of reach for trajectories starting from
the plasma bulk at the considered value L = 4.875/2π since the KAM on the edge at
q = N (4.2) < N (4, 1) has not yet been broken.

∼

We have also identiﬁed the q

value of the robust boundary circle protecting the plasma
core as being equal to N (1, 11), the most irrational between q = 1 and q = 12/11, according
to Eq. (60):

which is in poor agreement with the above rapid estimate (50), but correct to the ﬁrst three
digits.

4.3.3 The ITB: a double sided barrier around q = 9/8

The ﬁnal scheme which results from the above measurements on a very long tokamap tra-
jectory at L = 4.875/2π is the following. A magnetic line with an initial condition inside the
inner shell (IS) actually has an inward motion limited by a robust KAM torus protecting
the plasma core (or a Cantorus ?) at

and an outward motion limited by a semi-permeable Cantorus at:

qIS > N (1, 11) = 1.086 >

13
12

qIS < N (1, 8) = 1.116

(68)

(69)

This numerical analysis shows that noble Cantori are good candidates to be identiﬁed with
internal transport barriers, as could have been anticipated from the relation between KAM
theory and number theory [18].

Once arrived in the main chaotic sea (CS) extending up to the plasma edge, the magnetic
line wanders around island remnants, remains stuck around some of them (here in Figs.(13,
11) around the q = 5/2 chain), but its inward motion is limited by a semi-permeable
Cantorus

qCS > N (1, 7) = 1.131 >

(70)

9
8

40

The measurements indicate that this inward-motion limit in the chaotic sea is diﬀerent from
(and located above) the outward motion limit of the IS :

N (1, 8) = 1.116 <

= 1.125 < N (1, 7) = 1.131

(71)

9
8

We have thus observed the existence of a two-sided transport barrier around q = 9/8 and
limited on each side by a Cantorus, respectively at q = N (1, 8) and q = N (1, 7).

On the other end, the outward motion in the chaotic sea is limited by a curve which will

be proved in Section (5) to be a KAM surface at

qCS < N (4, 2) = 4.382

(72)

which is the most irrational number between 4 and 4.5. This external KAM surface thus
appears indeed a good candidate for the external barrier observed here.

We are thus in presence of a double-sided transport barrier, composed of two Cantori, the
lower Cantorus with noble q
value N (1, 8) = 1.116, the upper Cantorus with noble value
N (1, 7) = 1.131. These Cantori appear on Fig.(21). From (57) we have N (1, 7) > Q(9) >
N (1, 8) , which shows that the rational surface q = Q(9) = 9/8 is actually between these two
Cantori and thus inside the transport barrier. In this sense, one can say that this internal
transport barrier is actually located around a dominant rational surface, in spite of the fact
that it is actually composed of two irrational, noble Cantori.

−

4.3.4 Experimental localization of barriers in the Tokamak q -proﬁle

From the experimental point of view, transport barriers in tokamaks are indeed generally
observed ”around” the main rational q-values [2].

In the RTP tokamak, with a wide range of q-values (0.8 =

5) in a reversed sheared
proﬁle, it has been observed, by varying the heat deposition radius ρdep of oﬀ-axis ECH
heating, that the central electron temperature Te(0) decreases by a series of plateaux [2]. It
is observed that the values of qm of the diﬀerent plateaux fall in half-integer bands, i.e. qm
crosses a half-integer value each time the discharge transits from one plateau to the next.
Since these transitions correspond to the loss of a TB, these authors deduced that ”the
barriers are associated with half-integer values of q .”

⇒

It has been reported that some ”ears” appear in the Te proﬁle (appearance of one bump
on each side of the central value) when the heat deposition radius ρdep is localized inside
a transition between two plateaux [2]. We note that the existence of such ”ears” could be
an indication in favor of the existence of a double-sided semi-permeable TB around ρdep,
as found in the previous Section (4.3.3). Such ”ears” appear to be unstable and to crash
in a repetitive fashion, showing that the barrier can indeed be crossed and appears to be
permeable.

The central sawteeth allows to place the ﬁrst barrier ”near” q = 1 ; oﬀ-axis sawteeth
indicate other barriers near q = 3/2, 2 and 3. Remaining barriers are attributed to q = 4/3
and 5/2.

In all cases the barriers observed in experiments are associated with those ”dominant
rational” q-values, but a speciﬁc experimental work could hardly have been done in order to
determine more precisely the possible role of noble or other irrational values around these
”dominant rationals”.

Up to now it has been generally admitted [2], [8], [10] that internal transport barriers
could correspond to rational q-values, where primary island appear. Chaotic motion can be
observed between these primary rational islands but mainly around the hyperbolic points.

41

The picture we obtain here is rather diﬀerent. It is well known that, in presence of several
island chains, secondary islands appear and accumulate around irrational surfaces where
KAM surfaces ﬁnally broke themselves into discrete pieces forming a Cantorus. This is
precisely the location where we have found internal barriers: they appear as Cantori on
irrational surfaces rather than rational surfaces.

This ﬁnding can in turn be helpful to build transport models like the q-comb model [23],
[24]. From experimental considerations, such models deﬁne indeed barriers are localized
around main rational q-values, but the width if the barriers has still to be deﬁned. We
propose to localize the edges of each barrier on the most irrational value in the prescribed
domain.

4.4 Last barrier in the standard map: the golden KAM

In order to illustrate the destruction of a robust barrier, there exists one example in which
a KAM surface can be represented just at the critical point where it is broken into a Can-
torus. This is the case of the standard map [27] where the critical value of the stochasticity
It is interesting to remind that the last
parameter is known with a very high precision.
KAM surface in that case has been identiﬁed to be the Golden KAM with q-value equal to
G, the golden number. The breaking of this surface and its transformation into a Cantorus
is known to occur at a critical value of the stochasticity parameter which is known [18] to
be given by K = KC = 0.971635406. Because such a drawing is not easily found in the
literature for this value of K, it appears worthwhile to present the trajectory following this
critical curve. In Fig.(18) we present part of the phase portrait of the standard map for
K = KC . Two series of islands remnants q = 8/5 and q = 5/3 can be seen, corresponding
. The last KAM
to two convergents towards the Golden number G = lim of
with q = G is exhibited inbetween, and it appears as the last existing non-chaotized KAM
(cid:0)
surface, surrounded by chaotic layers around rational islands.

This example shows the detailed structure of an irrational KAM barrier surrounded by

chaotic, permeable zones.

4.5 Perturbed q -proﬁle in the tokamap

4.5.1 Exact perturbed q-proﬁle

In order to understand the radial positions of these barriers on the exact q -proﬁle of the
tokamap, we have succeeded to draw a one-dimensional q-proﬁle of the magnetic surfaces, not
as function of the radius (since perturbed surfaces are not circular anymore), but as function
of the distance X between the polar axis and their intersection point in the equatorial plane.
We have calculated the intersections of several trajectories with the equatorial plane (at θ = 0
and θ = 0.5) and measured their q-value, by computing the average increase of the poloidal
angle according to Eq.(48).

In this way we obtain a rather precise proﬁle of the perturbed q-values of various magnetic
surfaces or island chains, represented at the two (non-symmetrical) points where they cross
the equatorial plane, see Fig.(19). Let us recall that the radius r represented on the various
ﬁgures is deﬁned by r = √2ψ (see Eq.(36). This variable r varies from 0 to √2 on the edge
of the plasma, while the variable x = √ψ = r/√2 varies from 0 to 1 and represents the
reduced radial coordinate with respect to the small radius of the torus.

existing non-chaotized KAM surface; its initial conditions are I = 0.52969, θ = 0.75.

The measured points roughly agree with the unperturbed curve (Fig.(19)). But a detailed
drawing in Fig.(20) reveals a rather unexpected point: the perturbed safety factor proﬁle
in the equatorial plane exhibits a local maximum on the magnetic axis, and a minimum on
both sides.

The measured q-value near the magnetic axis appears to be

(74)

This non-monotonous perturbed q -proﬁle , which is spontaneously created by the magnetic
perturbation, could be the reason for the appearance of transport barriers in the tokamap.

4.5.2 An ITB in the rev-tokamap

Transport barriers are very frequent in reversed shear situations, and they also appear in
the tokamap model for such cases. We recall indeed that a transport barrier has already
been shown to occur around the minimum of a reversed shear q -proﬁle (”revtokamap” [37]).
In the discussion of Fig. 4 in Ref.
[37], for L = 2.8/2π, it is observed that ”the chaotic
region is sharply bounded from below by a KAM barrier” located at 1/q = 0.5772. We
note that this value is only 0.5% away from a noble value 1/q = 0.5802 which corresponds
] = 1 + (1/ (1 + 1/ (2 + 1/G))) = 1.7236068... which is larger than the
to q = [1, 1, 2, (1, )

N (1, 8) = 1.116 of the lower Cantorus, and N (1, 11) = 1.086 of the KAM barrier protecting
the plasma core, along with the extension of these curves with the equatorial axis X. The
value on the magnetic axis is qMA = 1.1346 > N (1, 7) and lies at the center of a proﬁle

scale)

Golden number and appears from (60) to be the most irrational number between 5/3 and
7/4. Within a precision of 0.5%, the transport barrier found in [37] could thus well be
located on a noble value again, even in the previous situation of a reversed magnetic shear
proﬁle.

4.5.3 Inverse shear in the tokamap

The inner shell, which has been observed between qC1 = 1.080 and qC2 = 1.111, actually
involves q-values lower than that measured on the magnetic axis (Eq. (74)), down to q
1.07
(see Fig.(20), precisely because of the non-monotonous proﬁle.

≃

One can see that the q-values decrease from the magnetic axis towards a separatrix
passing through the polar axis (on which two hyperbolic points are superposed, as long as
L < 1). This whole region inside the separatrix would appear however to have q = 1 if
and only if q was computed around the polar (geometrical) axis, but this way of counting
has not much physical meaning, besides showing that this plasma core could appear as an
island m = n = 1 in the reference frame of the polar axis. As a result, trajectories inside
values (around the magnetic axis) which decrease from the
the chaotic shell have actually q
boundary circle for those trajectories which do not enclose the polar axis (ψ = 0, θ = 0),
but which increase for those which encircle the polar axis, up to the value N (1, 8) of the
lower Cantorus. In the chaotic sea, the q -proﬁle is monotonously growing : trajectories
values higher than the upper Cantorus and lower than the boundary circle on the
have q
edge, which is the expected situation.

up to the robust KAM torus on the edge at N (4, 2). The two robust barriers and the two
Cantori are represented on Fig.(21) along with a part of each chaotic region.

4.6 Sticking measurements

On the other hand, we have seen in Fig.(13) that a long trapping stage is observed in the
chaotic zone surrounding the island remnants q = 5/2. For a much longer trajectory (1011
iterations) one observes that such temporary but long trapping can occur around almost all
rational and specially around the main islands known to play a role in the tokamaks: q = 2/1,
5/2 and 3/1. In Fig.(22) we have computed the normalized histogram showing the occurrence
H of sticking times longer than 105 (in a run of 1011 iterations with L = 4.875/2π), obtained
by a sliding average, as a function of the radial position ψ of the visited island chain. The
values of ψ are taken within small intervals of 2.10−4. This graph exhibits the frequent
occurrence of long sticking times in and around the main rational chains : the two bumps
0.1)
correspond to widespread ψ values of a line wandering in the chaotic shell (around ψ
and in the chaotic sea (around ψ
0.4 to 0.8). These are the main two chaotic zones. On the
other hand one remarks sharp peaks representing long sticking events at the corresponding
ψ values. In the chaotic sea bump, we identiﬁed very precisely (by measuring the exact
average-ψ value of the corresponding q) long and frequent sticking events around island
remnants q = 2, 5/2 and 3 (with satellite peaks at neighboring rationals), etc... This kind
of graph yields a precise measurement of the richness of trapping phenomena.

It would be interesting to study the characteristics of the other secondary barriers, sur-
rounding the ”holes” in the phase portrait Fig.(11) and to determine if such local barriers
also correspond to noble Cantori in the proﬁle of the local q-value (around the local magnetic
axis in the center of the island remnant). For instance a sticking region is easy to observe
along the edge on the q = 9/8 islands.

The interest of this new description of ITB’s in tokamaks is that mathematical tools
exist for the description of the motion across such Cantori (”turnstiles” etc...
[46]), and
these tools can be used to study transport across internal transport barriers in conﬁned
plasmas. Calculation of the ﬂux through a Cantorus, deﬁned by the limit of its convergents,
can be performed by using the turnstile mechanism [46]. This subject is presented in the
next Section 5.

5 Calculation of the ﬂux across noble barriers

The study of a single long orbit points out some transport phenomena which occur between
some phase-space’s zones separated by internal transport barriers (ITB), but it does not
give information about the ﬂux through these barriers ( i.e. the area of the set formed by
points which pass through a ITB at every iteration). This information will be obtained
in this section from Mather’s theorem. Using Greene’s conjecture we conﬁrm the observed
existence, for L = 4.875
0.776, of the invariant circle on the plasma edge having the
2π ∼
rotation number ω1 = 1
N (1,7) .
Both Greene’s and Mather’s approaches use the intimate connection between quasiperiodic
and periodic orbits.

A point (θ0, ψ0) is a periodic point of type (n, m), with periodicity m, if T

(θ0, ψ0)
= (θ0 + n, ψ0). The rotation number of a periodic orbit exists and is equal to ι/2π = n/m
(i.e. the limit in Eq.(48) exists); it is clearly independent of the initial point on a periodic
chain. This global property persists for invariant curve, under some restriction on the map.
The rotation number may also be irrational in this case. Beside periodic orbits and invariant
curves (called invariant circles, for topological reasons), an intermediate case of invariant
set exists, on which rotation number exists and is irrational: the Cantori. The dynamics
on these three types of invariant set is generally quasiperiodic: the ”time” dependence can
be expressed by a generalized Fourier series, with rational frequencies for rational ω, and
irrational incommensurate frequencies in the remaining cases (see Ref. [47] or Ref. [48] for
details). Both periodic and quasiperiodic points can be obtained as stationary points in the
action principle.

The ”action principle” for maps is the analogous of the Lagrangian variational principle

A very simple proof is presented in Ref. [49]

In 1927 Birkhoﬀ [50] showed that every area-preserving twist map has at least two
periodical orbits of type (n, m) for each rational winding number 1
m in an appropriate
interval (called the twist interval). For area-preserving twist map it can be proved (see Ref.
[47] p.38 for commentaries) that, for each rational n
m in the twist interval described by the
map, there exists at least one periodic orbit of type (n, m) which extremizes
(it is called
extremizing orbit ) and at least one periodic orbit of type (n, m) which is a saddle point of

q = n

A

(it is called a maxmin orbit ).

In order to study the linear stability properties of a (n, m)- periodic orbit one computes

For twist maps, Mather (see Refs. [54] and [55]) proved the existence of a stationary and
(79). It gives rise
moreover ”extremizing” function θext which extremizes the functional
to an invariant set (C). Its equation can be obtained from (77, 78). If θext is continuous then
(C) is an invariant circle. If θext is not continuous (but has a countable set of discontinuities
because it is monotonous), then the closure (the set of the limit points) of (C) would be a
Cantor set, called ”Cantorus”. A very good survey on this problem is given in Ref. [47].

5.2 Study of quasiperiodic orbits via periodic orbits

The invariant set (invariant circle or Cantorus) having the irrational rotation number ω
(θ) deﬁned in (79),
was obtained using a stationary point θext of the action functional
but it is also the limit circle of a sequence of periodic orbits having rotation numbers nν
mν
= ω. High order periodic orbits may thus be considered as good enough
, when lim
ν→∞
approximations for the invariant set and the study of their properties gives information
about the invariant set properties. So, an irrational magnetic surface can be described as
the limit of its rational convergents by observing higher and higher order periodic motions.

nν

A

There are at least two approaches to study the connection between these invariant sets
and the periodic orbits: the Greene’s conjecture (which relates the existence of the invariant
set to the stability of a particular sequence of periodic orbits) and the Mather’s theorem
(which gives necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the existence of the invariant set and
computes the ﬂux through it).

For a noble number ω we will denote by

the sequence of its convergents (see

Sections 4.2 and 4.3 for deﬁnitions and computations). We denote by R+
maxmin orbit (passing through elliptic or inverse hyperbolic points) and R−
an extremizing orbit (passing through direct hyperbolic points) of type (nν, mν).

The analytical form of the action generating function Fa (θν , θν+1) deﬁned in (13) for
the Tokamap cannot be derived analytically from the map equations (89). To obtain it
one has to solve the equation (32) for the unknown ψν+1, using the q-proﬁle (15, 39), and
to substitute it in (13).
It can be proved that the equation (32) has an unique solution
ψν+1 = ψν+1 (θν, θν+1) but this solution cannot be obtained through analytical methods.
However, numerical values of Fa (θν , θν+1) can be computed. In order to compute ∆An/m ,
the formula (86) will be used.

5.4 Numerical results for computing the ﬂuxes in the case L =

4.875/2π

The numerical results presented in this paragraph actually conﬁrm the existence of a KAM
barrier with rotation number ω1 = 1/N (4, 2), as noticed above. We also evaluate the ﬂux
through the upper Cantorus of the internal transport barrier, which has the rotation number
ω2 = 1/N (1, 7).

In computing these ﬂuxes the identiﬁcation of long periodic orbits is important. Since
the phase portrait of the tokamap has no symmetries it is quite diﬃcult to localize long
periodical orbits. This can however be done by using an algorithm, described in Appendix

54

B, which is based on the Fletcher-Reeves method. In spite of the large number of digits
used in the calculations (18 digits), the roundoﬀ errors (see a discussion p.276 in [19]) still
introduce numerical deviations and errors in computing long periodic orbits, for the well-
known reason that hyperbolic periodic points are unstable and the system exhibits a strongly
sensitivity to the initial conditions.

For the (observed) KAM barrier having the rotation number ω1 = 1/N (4, 2) the sequence
of the convergents was obtained in (66). The results of the numerical computations for R+

ν is decreasing from R+

The periodic points were computed with an error of the order 10−13. We can notice that
R+
ν is increasing
from R−
0.078168125 in 11 steps, approaching to 0. The
Greene’s conjecture (subcritical case) is fulﬁlled. Probably because L = 4.875/2π is near
the threshold value for breaking up the KAM barrier (see Section 3.1.6 and Conjecture in
Section 3.2) the convergence is very slow.

We observe that the sequence of values for the ﬂuxes (∆Anν /mν )ν∈N is rapidly decreas-
ing, hopefully towards 0, and this allows us to argue that the ﬂux through this noble KAM
surface q = N (4, 2) is indeed zero, indicating the existence of a strongly resistant barrier
on the edge of the plasma for L = 4.875/2π, as observed in the simulations.

The computer errors enable us to evaluate correctly the ﬂuxes through a curve passing
through the points of a Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ chain containing more than 2x390 = 780 points,
even the formula for the escape area can be used. But the error in computing the ﬂuxes

increases from 1.862
same order of magnitude as the ﬂux for ν > 7. From this high periodicity, the computations
are not precise.

We notice that Greene’s conjecture (the supercritical case) again is fulﬁlled: R+

Because the escape areas’ sequence is decreasing with a decreasing slope, we may
10−8 and is of the
consider that it goes to a constant, and that its limit is less than 3.4357
order of 10−8 . This is the value of the magnetic ﬁeld lines’ ﬂux through the internal barrier
having the rotation number N (1, 7). It means that, at every iteration, the magnetic ﬁeld
lines passing by points which do occupy a surface (in the Poincar´e section) having an area
10−8 pass through the Cantorus, in the chaotic sea. In the same
of approximately 3.4357
time some other magnetic lines (located in a set with the same area in the chaotic sea) come
inside the region bounded by the Cantorus.

·

·

We can also observe that we can ﬁnd elliptic points in every neighborhood of the KAM
barrier, but near the partial transport barrier the high order convergents are direct or
inverse hyperbolic, with exponentially increasing (with the periodicity order) residues. It
results from this that the partial transport barrier is located on a more chaotic zone, as
compared to the KAM barrier, where there are many zones with regular dynamics (near the
elliptic points) which are embedded in the chaotic zone. The chaoticity of the chaotic zone
is reduced in the vicinity of the KAM, because the residues of the direct hyperbolic points
approach to zero.

The results can be summarized as follows. For the KAM barrier, the positive and the
negative residues converges slowly to 0, so the subcritical case in the Greene’s conjecture
is veriﬁed . The possible explanation for this slow convergence is that the value of the
stochasticity parameter K = 4.875 is very near the threshold for large scale dispersion due
to the breaking up the edge barrier. By computing the periodic orbit with an error of 10−13,
we obtain still decreasing values of the ﬂux of the order of 10−9, actually smaller than the
ﬂux across the Cantorus. So, we may expect the convergence towards 0.

For the Cantorus, the values of the ﬂux are actually comparable with the values for
the KAM for small periods, but the last we were able to compute is of the order of 10−9.
The Fig.(24) shows that it seems to already converge towards a value larger than the one
obtained for the KAM.

In conclusion, the Greene’s conjecture and Mather’s theorem are veriﬁed in both situ-
ations and the numerical results are in agreement with the theory. From Fig.(24) we can
thus conclude that the existence of (i) a KAM surface, the plasma edge barrier, having the

6 Asymptotic radial subdiﬀusion

Dispersive motion of magnetic lines in a stochastic zone is often described very roughly as
a random walk. We stress the fact that the radial motion observed here is non-diﬀusive.
In order to determine more precisely the average dispersion properties of magnetic lines in
a situation of incomplete chaos (diﬀusion, subdiﬀusion or superdiﬀusion) and their scaling
properties with the perturbation, we have calculated the asymptotic properties of a set of
5000 magnetic lines. Initial conditions are chosen in the chaotic shell on an initial circle
ψ = 0.001, r
0.0316, outside of the protected plasma core, either as a bunch of lines
within a small angular interval ∆θ = 0.001, or on a complete circle with regularly spaced
initial values of the initial angle θ between 0 and 1. The values of the stochasticity parameter
L are varied in a wide range between 0.776 and 6.68, beyond the threshold for large scale
chaos above which all magnetic lines from the chaotic shell ﬁnally cross the edge barrier,
transformed into a permeable Cantorus. Here we also study the radial position x = √ψ of
a magnetic line, which is unity on the unperturbed plasma edge.

∼

We have to stress the fact that with such large values of the stochasticity parameter
L, almost all magnetic lines in the central chaotic shell are crossing the plasma edge. This
situation is of course of less interest for conﬁnement studies. It would rather be characteristic,
instead, of a situation of plasma disruption due to the rapid escape of the magnetic lines. The
time behavior of this escape is however interesting in order to study the scaling properties of
this dispersive motion, as compared with other maps like the standard map, where a similar
ﬂux diﬀusion has been intensely studied since many years.

6.1 Long time behavior

Although the individual motion of one magnetic line appears to be discrete and random,
average properties like the mean poloidal ﬂux ψm and the mean radius, averaged over initial
conditions, can be described by ”continuous” functions of ”time” (the number of large turns
around the torus) :

ψm(t)

ψ(t)
i

≡ h

,

xm(t)

ψ(t)

,

≡

Dp

E

In order to deduce dispersion properties, we also calculate a third independent quantity :
the mean square displacements (MSD) of the ﬂux, deﬁned in the reference frame of the
average motion :

M SDψ(t)

[ψ(t)

≡

D

ψm(t)]2

The MSD of the radius is also computed, and we check that the following exact relation is
veriﬁed at each time in terms of the average motion :

The intuitive picture emerging from these results is the dispersion of magnetic lines from
an initial circle of intersection points, passing local weak barriers, coming back an forth and
expanding radially in average. The asymptotic state of course strongly depends on the value
of the stochasticity parameter L , as well as all characteristic times which appear to scale
like L−2 (see Eqs.(102) below).

6.1.1 Asymptotic motion in the conﬁned domain

In the conﬁnement domain, the global diﬀusion of course vanishes, but the details of the time
behavior of an ensemble of magnetic lines is characteristic of the phase portrait presented
in Fig.(11). For L = 4.875/2π
0.776, the orders of magnitude of the characteristic times
can be inferred from Fig.(13) and tested in the present average evolution : residence times
106 (downwards peaks), residence times in
inside the ITB would be of the order of τ IT B ≈
107 and in the chaotic sea of the order of
the chaotic shell would be of the order of τ shell ≈
τ sea ≈

108 iterations.

We ﬁrst consider a bunch of 500 initial conditions within ∆θ = 0.001 followed over 109
iterations for L = 4.875/2π
0.776. We observe that none of the 500 considered magnetic
lines succeeds to escape from the plasma edge even after 109 iterations, and the average
0.7 which proves that the robust KAM barrier on
radius saturates around a value xm(t)
the plasma edge is still resistant (see Figs.(13) and (11)). The detailed form of the time
dependence is however interesting, especially concerning the average radius xm(t) and the
radial dispersion M SDx(t) (see Fig.(25). In Fig.(25.a) which represents xm(t), we see at
0.0316 and saturating
short times large oscillations starting from the initial condition x
after about 102 iterations; this can be explained by the motion of the bunch of lines as a
whole, along the non circular magnetic surfaces making an excursion towards larger x values
at each poloidal turn in θ.

∼

∼

∼

For larger times, up to 106, a slow increase of the average value is observed up to a value
xm(t)
0.2 is
0.2, while the dispersion remains constant (Fig.(25.b)). This value xm(t)
important since it roughly corresponds to the position of the transport barrier (averaged
along θ). The resulting interpretation is the following : the ensemble of magnetic lines
describe a CTRW with long sojourn times inside (or below) the ITB, so that the average
position does not exceed that of the ITB. The dispersion remains constant (zero diﬀusion)
since the chaotic motion occurs inside a restricted region below the upper Cantorus of the
barrier.

∼

Understanding the global motion for longer times, between 106 and 108, appears as
a challenging question. It is seen indeed in Fig.(25.a) that the average radius suddenly
begins to increase in time (roughly like t1/2), while the dispersion M SDx(t) (Fig.(25.b))
ﬁrst increases (roughly like t1) from 106 to 107, has a maximum and then decreases toward
a constant value. An interpretation of this overshooting can be tentatively proposed as
follows.

106 the dispersion is dominated by the trapping processes
- For times shorter than τ IT B ≈
inside the ITB, and the very few lines which succeed to escape across the barrier actually
create a slow increase of the curve.

107 usual diﬀusion occurs in the chaotic shell and

M SDx(t) grows linearly in time.

106 to τ shell ≈

- Then from τ IT B ≈
- Around τ shell ≈
- After τ shell ≈

of this chaotic shell limited by the ITB.

107 saturation of the dispersion is observed because of the ﬁnite size

107 a non negligible part of the magnetic lines are in the chaotic sea,
and long sticking events occur around the main rational chains (see Fig.(22)) which result
in a decrease of the dispersion.

- Final saturation of the dispersion is obtained around τ sea ≈

This average position of the magnetic lines can also be roughly explained in terms of
the estimated average residence times : each region (chaotic shell, ITB and chaotic sea) has
indeed an average radial position (averaged over θ), and when these average positions are
weighted by the percentage of time spent in each region, one ﬁnds indeed a result of the
order of the asymptotic radius observed in Fig.(25.a): xm(t)
0.7. Such an agreement
should not be taken too seriously, and very long iterations should be necessary in order to
compute accurate residence times for this presumed CTRW, but the orders of magnitude
found yield a ﬁrst explanation.

→

When the same calculation is performed for an initial circle of magnetic lines starting
0.0316, analogous results are obtained in Fig.(26) except

from the same value ψ = 0.001, r
for the short time oscillations which are of smaller amplitude but which however remain.

∼

6.1.2 Asymptotic motion in the transition domain

For a slightly higher value of the stochasticity parameter L = 5/2π
0.796, the same
series of transitions occurs at small value of the ”time” : we may thus consider shorter
asymptotic times and a larger number of initial conditions. For such L value, all magnetic
lines actually go beyond the plasma edge, indicating that the KAM on the edge is already
broken, transformed in some Cantorus. The latter still represents some barrier, and the
average motion is diﬀerent inside and outside this permeable barrier.

∼

In Figs.(27.a to d) we have represented the four functions xm(t), M SDx(t), ψm(t) and
M SDψ(t) for a bunch of 5000 initial lines. Clearly a similar transition region is obtained,
as in Figs. (25) and (26), but here for smaller values of time (roughly from 105 to 106). In
this time domain a straight line is observed in each graph, corresponding to the following
t2
transient time behaviors: xm(t)
which represent a transient diﬀusion of the radius and a superdiﬀusion of the ﬂux ψ. For such
an initial bunch of lines, the initial oscillations are well pronounced. Here the asymptotic
behavior is not yet reached after 108 iterations and it seems that the dispersion of the radius
M SDx(t) could tend to a constant value, probably because of the presence of a resistant
barrier very far out of the plasma. The latter is of no physical relevance for the tokamak,
but is however characteristic of the present process of destruction of successive barriers in
an incomplete chaos situation.

6.1.3 Asymptotic motion in the large scale dispersion domain

Beyond such transition region, for L = 5.5/2π
0.875 the time behavior is more regular. In
Fig.(28.a to d), we have represented the four function xm(t), M SDx(t), ψm(t) and M SDψ(t).
As expected the initial oscillations are less pronounced, but still exist. Some transient
behavior can hardly be seen (around 103 in M SDψ(t)) and a rapid growth leads to a ﬁnal
asymptotic state reached after 105
106 iterations, in which a simple time behavior is
measured.

∼

−

One notes a common (but not fully understood) feature of all the graphs in that domain
of L-values: all these functions seem to present an inﬂection point when reaching the absolute
value unity. In the graphs for xm(t) this occurs at a time of physical relevance, called the
escape time tϕ (the time to reach the edge of the plasma at ψ = 1, x = 1, such that
xm(tϕ) = 1) which is here tϕ ≈

In Fig.(28.b) for M SDx(t) we remark that some overshooting of the curve appears around
105, before the asymptotic state is reached. Such bump does not appear on the other func-
tions. Is it simply the eﬀect of a distant barrier, out of the plasma edge, which temporarily
traps magnetic lines ?

Such a bump also appears in Fig.(29.b) for M SDx(t) at a higher value L = 6/2π

0.955
for an initial bunch of 5000 lines. In each of the Figs.(29.a to d), all the features remain
103 and that asymptotic state
unchanged, except that the escape time is decreased tϕ ≈
is reached more rapidly, around 104.

∼

For higher L values L = 9/2π, dispersion is still more rapid and the asymptotic state
is reached more rapidly. Here we follow a circle of 5000 initial lines. One note however in
Figs.(30.a to d) that the curve in log-log scale has a long time slope which is slowly decreasing
towards what we consider as the asymptotic state, so that long iterations are necessary to
evaluate accurately the time behavior and the dispersion coeﬃcients introduced below (see
Eqs. (102) ).

For a set of values of the stochasticity parameter L in the large scale dispersion domain,
we have measured the asymptotic slope and dispersion coeﬃcient of each quantity (94 to
96). Our measurements indicate that the average radius is found to increase asymptotically
in time as t1/4 :

which means radial sub-diﬀusion. Although surprising, this is however not a fully new result:
similar phenomena of ”strange” transport 14 [60] (where M SDr(t)
= 1) have
been measured, namely for charged particles sticking around an island remnant in a chaotic
three-wave chaotic model [61] resulting in a t1/3 behavior [62].

∼

It has to be noted that, with the same unperturbed magnetic ﬁeld (35), the direct
integration of the magnetic line equations of motion, in presence of Fourier series magnetic
perturbations or a distribution of current ﬁlaments, has already yielded a fully equivalent
t1/4 asymptotic behavior the quantity
M SDx(t) rapidly called by these authors as being
some ”average displacement” of magnetic lines in chaotic layers [63]. This t1/4 law is in total
agreement with the results (100) obtained here in a simple map.

p

The above subdiﬀusive result (100) is however reached asymptotically for long times. In
the present incomplete chaotic regime of the tokamap, it shows a slower dispersion (µ <
1) which is diﬀerent from the usual diﬀusion in a completely chaotic situation [64]. A
comparison is performed below, after Eq.(112) and in Fig.(32), in Section 6.4.

For physical times, of the order of the average time tϕ necessary to escape from the
boundary circle, diﬀerent transient regimes are observed instead, with a rapid radial super-
diﬀusion (µ > 1) observed when crossing the plasma edge. In other words, although the

6.2 Scaling properties

Another important feature of transport processes is the scaling property of the corresponding
dispersion coeﬃcients (101) in terms of the perturbation parameter L. In order to draw the
scaling laws for these coeﬃcients, we deﬁne arbitrarily the ﬁrst values by Lo, ao, bo, Dxo and
D and we plot the above numerical results reduced to these ﬁrst values as L/Lo, a/ao, b/bo, Dx/Dxo
and Dψ/Dψ0, respectively.

We clearly see in Fig.(31) that the various coeﬃcients scale as follows : a(L)

Summarizing the results obtained for the both dependences in L and t (see Section (4)),
we can write down the following asymptotic formulas describing both the long time depen-
dence (Eq.(98) to (100)) and the scaling properties of the so-deﬁned dispersion coeﬃcients
a(L), b(L), Dx(L) and Dψ(L) :

In the standard map, which is periodic in both variables angle and action, it is well

action yields the result D(L) = Dql(L).S(L), where S(L) involves a series of Bessel function
J(L), and where the simple coeﬃcient

Dql(L) = L2/4

(103)

can be obtained from a random phase argument. This classical result for the standard map
is actually modiﬁed by the presence of accelerator modes, which do not occur here. Beyond

which shows not only that the same quasi-linear diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dql(L) applies both
in the standard map and in the tokamap, but moreover that no Bessel functions seem to
appear here, probably due to the lack of periodicity of the map in the ﬂux variable.

Some methods for the calculation of diﬀusion coeﬃcients in maps where variables are
clearly separated are given in [67]. An analytical derivation of even a simple result like
Eq.(104) for the tokamap (Eqs. (31), (32) where variables are not separated) seems however
to be diﬃcult to prove in general using the usual Fourier path diagram method [66]. It is
however very simple to check that the same random phase argument can be applied to the
tokamap and the same result (103) is obtained, as for the standard map but without any
Bessel functions here. Unlike the standard map, this asymptotic behavior (104) is valid for
all values of the stochasticity parameter L.

(105)

We have no theoretical explanation for such slow phenomenon in the tokamap, but in similar,
simpler systems, relaxation times are also very long. For the standard map [28] [43], very
long iteration sequences have been necessary to perform measurements of the transition
probability between diﬀerent basins and to characterize the corresponding CTRW. A detailed
kinetic theory has been elaborated very recently [68] for the standard map, showing also
very long relaxation times.

Since asymptotic behavior is only reached after such long relaxation times, of course
magnetic lines are already far beyond the physical domain of the plasma (ψ 6 1). For
instance in Fig.(28.a), for a value L = 5.5/2π just after breaking of the edge KAM, we
can see that the average radius rm reaches the edge of the (unperturbed) plasma after a
”physical” or ”escape time” tϕ such that rm(tϕ) = 1, which yields

104

tϕ ≈

(106)

At least for values of L & 5/2π
0.796 , beyond the escape threshold, this time represents
an estimate of the escape time, or more precisely, an estimation of the number of turns (the
long way) around the torus after which a magnetic line has reached the plasma edge.

∼

It is interesting to translate the number of iterations in the tokamap (thus the number
of turns) into an average time for thermal particles to reach the plasma edge by following
the magnetic lines (in absence of collisional or magnetic drift eﬀects). One iteration time
step in the tokamap represents actually the length of one large turn of length 2πR0 around
the torus. For a thermal particle following the ﬁeld line the physical time (106) can thus
be evaluated as the time necessary for a particle to travel tϕ times the long way along the
tϕ/Vth. In Tore Supra, this time is of the order of 10−2 s. for ions and
torus, i.e. 2πR0 ∗
10−4 s. for electrons in usual conditions (T = 5 keV )

tϕ i = 10−2s.

,

tϕ e = 10−4s.

(107)

70

In the same way one can deduce that the relaxation time, corresponding to 106 iterations
steps of the tokamap, actually represents 20 s for ions and 0.5 s. for electrons in Tore Supra.

tR i = 20 s.

,

tR e = 0.5 s.

These are the times necessary to reach the slow asymptotic subdiﬀusion regime at L =
0.796 . The transient superdiﬀusive regime occurring for t < tR is thus not
5.5/2π
excluded from the domain of practical interest, as well as asymptotic subdiﬀusion regime
obtained here.

∼

These values of the escape time in the tokamap (107) are thus much shorter than the
0.20 s. which is admitted to be roughly equal to the
particle conﬁnement time τ P (cid:23)
energy conﬁnement time τ E, in the absence of additional heating for Tore Supra for instance.
Such escape times (106) are thus relevant for particle conﬁnement losses in tokamaks.

τ E ∼

For times of the order of the escape time t / tϕ, the average radius is growing like
t1., much faster than in the asymptotic state (98). The general shape of the curve
xm(tϕ)
Fig.(28.a) indeed indicates a slow initial growth, followed by a rapid increase of the slope,
similar to an exponential growth, and a ﬁnal saturation with a lower asymptotic slope. We
note that the pseudo-exponential growth occurs precisely around the physical time (106).

∼

In other words, although the asymptotic behavior of magnetic line motion in the tokamap
is a rather regular one (even if a ”strange” one) described by (102), nevertheless for ﬁnite
times of the order of the physical time we observe the following extremely rapid transient
time-behavior :

6.4 Comparison with classical diﬀusive predictions

We have to compare the present result (108) with the classical analytical prediction, i.e.
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of magnetic lines in a completely stochastic magnetic ﬁeld. This
process is parametrized by the amplitude of the magnetic perturbation β =
/B and by
parallel and perpendicular coherence lengths of the perturbation, λq and λ⊥, respectively.
This naturally introduces the control parameter of the problem : the Kubo number

which roughly measures the parallel coherence of the ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld : magnetic
diﬀusion will be small if α is small. The quasilinear approximation DQL for the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient in a completely chaotic ﬁeld is simply :

It is actually a quadratic approximation in the Kubo number α , where the ﬁrst factor
takes the dimensionality into account (the units of the magnetic diﬀusion coeﬃcients are in

in a completely stochastic ﬁelds in [64]. This coeﬃcient (110) has been originally derived
in [69], [70]. The radial mean square displacement < x2(z) >= 2DQL.z is growing linearly
with the toroidal distance z .

In order to make a connection with physical parameters of the tokamak, we have to
know the relation between the stochasticity parameter L and β the relative strength of
the perturbation introduced for instance in the non-axisymmetric external coils. From the
alternative derivation of the tokamap from canonical variables [32], this relation can be
derived as :

where R0/a = 1/εT is the aspect ratio of the torus.

Within the present dimensionless units (reduced to the minor radius a of the plasma
column), and with t being as previously the number of long turns around the torus, this
classical result writes (with z = 2πR0.t, λq

2πR0, r2 = 2x2 and L = 2πβ/εt) :

M SDQL(t) = √2πL2t

(112)

It can easily be shown that this linear function (112) remains for all times much above the
numerical result of Fig.(28.b), even for physical times of the order of tϕ where the growth
rate is like t2.75: in Fig.(32) we draw the dispersion measurements of the radial position in
the present situation of incomplete chaos for L = 5.5/2π
0.876 (as in Fig.(28.b)) along
with its asymptotic slope (dotted line) which exhibits an asymptotic radial subdiﬀusion. In
the domain between t = 103 and 104 (around the escape time tϕ , see Eq. (106)), one clearly
observe a superdiﬀusive regime. All these measured behaviors of M SDx(t) nevertheless ap-
pear at all relevant times to remain much smaller than the quasi-linear diﬀusion in complete
chaos as represented by the upper straight line described by the classical Eq. (112) [69].

∼

In conclusion, the transient superdiﬀusion observed in the tokamap model for times of
the order of the physical or escape time is actually less eﬀective than the classical quasilinear
prediction. This means that classical transport in a completely stochastic magnetic ﬁeld as
studied in [69], [70] and [64] is actually more dramatic for plasma conﬁnement than the
strange transport observed in the present model for incomplete chaos. A transient, very
rapid growth, although ”superdiﬀusive” is not always ”more dangerous” than a linear one...

7 CONCLUSIONS:

The chaotic motion of magnetic lines in a toroidal perturbed geometry has been analyzed
using a Hamiltonian map called tokamap [16] deﬁned by (32, 33, 34) in terms of the stochas-
ticity parameter L. It describes the successive intersection points of a magnetic line in a
poloidal plane (ψ, θ) . From the previous analysis of ﬁxed points bifurcations, new results
have been derived for the Shafranov shift in this map (Fig.(1)). We restrict ourselves to the
case of an monotonous unperturbed safety factor proﬁle with a central value q(0) = 1.

The generic phase portrait in the poloidal plane (ψ, θ) consists in a protected non-
chaotic plasma core, surrounded by a chaotic shell limited by a semi-permeable Cantorus
which has been identiﬁed. For increasing values of L magnetic lines ﬁnally cross this ﬁrst
barrier and wander in a wide chaotic sea, extending up to the plasma edge (Fig.(11)). This
domain of the phase portrait has the realistic structure with remnants of island chains on
the dominant rational q-values (Fig.(4)), and sticking process of magnetic lines around these
island remnants.

The important point we want to stress is that the diﬀerent barriers found in this con-
ﬁguration always correspond to irrational values of the safety factor, and not to rational

plete chaos are represented (lower black curve) for L = 5.5/2π

with its asymptotic slope (dotted line) which exhibits an asymptotic radial subdiﬀusion. In
the domain between t = 103 and 104 (around the escape time tϕ , see Eq. 99), one clearly
observe a superdiﬀusive regime. All these measured behaviors of M SDx(t) nevertheless ap-
pear at all relevant times to remain much smaller than the quasi-linear diﬀusion in complete
chaos as represented by the upper straight line described by the classical eq. 105 of Ref.[69]

values where island chains are formed. The golden number G is known to play no role in
this map [37]. It is thus quite natural from KAM theory that the ”next most irrational”
numbers, the ”noble” numbers N (1, k) = 1 + 1/(k + G−1) [17] could actually play an im-
portant role. The wandering motion in the inner shell is indeed limited by a KAM surface
(or a robust Cantorus) which is located in the case L = 4.875/2π
0.776 downward at
q = N (1, 11) = 1.086.., and upward by a semi-permeable Cantorus at q = N (1, 8) = 1.116....
The wandering motion in chaotic sea is limited downward by another identiﬁed Cantorus,
which is located slightly above the previous one at q = N (1, 7) = 1.131 : we thus ﬁnd the
existence of a double-sided internal transport barrier. Although this barrier includes a ratio-
nal surface (q = 9/8 = 1.125 in the case L = 4.875/2π
0.776) we have shown that the two
Cantori, which are actually the two sides of the barrier, are located on noble values of the
safety factor. The outer edge of the chaotic sea remains a strong external transport barrier
(a KAM surface or a robust Cantorus) at L = 4.875/2π ; its radial position in the q -proﬁle
appears to be located with a rather good precision at the most irrational number between
q = 4 and q = 4.5, i.e. at q = N (4, 2) = 3 + N (1, 2) = 4 + 1/(2 + G−1) = 4.382... The
transport barriers observed in this map have been proved (from ﬂux argument) to be noble
Cantori. The ﬂux of lines across permeable Cantori has been discussed in Section 5, by
using very precise calculations of high order periodic points along rational chains convergent
toward the Cantorus. The method used for determining these periodic point is summarized
in Appendix B.

∼

The motion along a very long trajectory shows moreover that the magnetic line motion
is intermittent ( Fig.(13)), with long stages in the inner shell and in the outer chaotic
sea, with occasional sticking periods around island remnants (Fig.(12)). These features are
characteristic of a continuous time random walk (CTRW). The external barrier actually
conﬁnes magnetic lines inside the plasma up to the appearance of a large scale motion above
a threshold of the stochasticity parameter around L

5/2π.

In order to describe the motion of magnetic lines beyond this large scale motion threshold,
we have considered a bunch of magnetic lines in a small area of phase space and study their
statistical average evolution. We have computed, the average radial position (94) of the
bunch of lines, and the mean square deviation of the radius (96) compared to this average
radius : this is the quantity deﬁning the spatial diﬀusion properties in the asymptotic stage
(subdiﬀusion or superdiﬀusion). We have also calculated the diﬀusion (95) of the poloidal
ﬂux ψ : the latter appears to describe asymptotically a classical diﬀusion (in ψ !) and behaves
as traditionally admitted, i.e. like the standard map in the quasi-linear stage, with a diﬀusion
L2 in the domain L = [5/2π, 21/2π]. This
coeﬃcient in action space which scales like D
diﬀusive behavior does not hold for magnetic lines in physical space.

∼

Since the action of poloidal ﬂux ψ is proportional to the square of the radius x, this
diﬀusion process in action is equivalent to a fourth moment of r. It is thus not surprising
at all that the radial r-motion appears to be asymptotically a spatial subdiﬀusion

In contradistinction with usual results for dispersion in completely chaotic situations (quasi-
linear description) , the radial motion of stochastic magnetic lines in the present tokamap
model, with incomplete chaos, thus appears as a radial ”strange diﬀusion” and not classical
diﬀusion. In (113) xm(t) is the average radius

which grows asymptotically as (L2t)1/4. The scaling laws (102) for the coeﬃcients of these
three average processes reveal a nice scaling in (L2t) for the asymptotic diﬀusion properties
of the tokamap, even for strange diﬀusion.

p

These general and asymptotic properties of magnetic line motion in a perturbed toroidal
geometry have been obtained in the tokamap model. However, the threshold value of the

74

∼

stochasticity parameter L
1 , for which particles begin to escape from the plasma to
describe large scale motion and a true diﬀusion in action space, is suﬃciently high, and the
relaxation time tR (105), necessary to reach the asymptotic stage, is suﬃciently long for this
asymptotic stage to be reached when the average radial position of the bunch of lines has
already crossed the plasma edge ψ = 1. As a consequence, the magnetic line motion inside
the plasma is either conﬁned by a KAM external barrier, and the asymptotic motion can
only be subdiﬀusive when L < 1 (like in Ref. [43]), or escaping from the plasma when L > 1,
but this occurs in average at a physical time tϕ (106) much shorter than the relaxation time
tR, so that the motion inside the plasma is not yet the asymptotic one (see Eq. 108), and
actually describes a transient regime of radial superdiﬀusion. This last observation could
seem much less favorable for plasma conﬁnement in perturbed magnetic structures with
incomplete chaos when L > 1, but actually the resulting motion appears to be much less
dramatic for plasma conﬁnement than the usual classical expectation from the quasilinear
description of classical diﬀusion in completely stochastic magnetic ﬁelds [69], [70], [64].

8 APPENDIX A: Standard safety factor proﬁle.

Standard radial proﬁles can be derived, within a circular cross section, by taking into account
elementary observations in cylindrical geometry (ρ, θ, z). The basic assumption of the model
consists in assuming a parabolic density proﬁle with vanishing condition on the edge:

n(x) = n(0)

where the radius x = ρ/a is reduced to the small radius a of the plasma. Such a proﬁle is
not inconsistent with early observations of ohmically heated plasmas [71].

Next, a general relation is assumed between temperature and density proﬁles. A system-
atic ﬁtting of many proﬁles on various early tokamaks [72] indicates that the temperature
proﬁle can adequately be represented by squaring the density proﬁle. Such a result can also
be obtained from simple analytical models of energy balance (see e.g. p. 41 in [73]). We

T 3/2 as function of the temperature [74] . For a stationary magnetic ﬁeld,

Faraday’s law implies indeed an irrotational electric ﬁeld ∂B
E = 0 hence in an
axisymmetrical system ∂Ez
∂ρ = 0, i.e. a constant electric ﬁeld along the radius. From a
simple expression of the Ohm’s law we thus ﬁnd that Ez(ρ) = η(ρ)jz(ρ) = cst. is actually
a constant along the radius ρ. From the temperature dependence of the Spitzer resistivity
one thus deduces in this simple model that the electric current density proﬁle is

This relation (118) has been demonstrated to hold in ohmically heated discharges of the

the stationarity of the magnetic entropy, in general conditions where the ohmic tokamak is
considered as a ”dissipative open system in equilibrium which interacts externally with the
ohmic transformer”.

odic points in discrete maps

In this appendix we explain how to determine hyperbolic and elliptic periodic points, by a
numerical algorithm derived from a generalization of the Fletcher-Reeves method, involving
the Jacobi matrix of the tokamap. More details are given in [76].

The existence of points with everywhere dense trajectories and the possibility to ap-
proximate every point by a periodic point are two important and apparently contradicting
aspects of chaotic systems. Nevertheless, the localization of many periodic points appears
highly necessary in order to describe the structure of the phase space. This is because a typ-
ical Hamiltonian system appears to belong to an intermediate category between completely
integrable and globally chaotic systems. Their phase space decomposes in a well organized
architecture of invariant subdomains. In this architecture the periodic points play the role
of a skeleton. The knowledge of their relative positions and residues, permits to determine,
at least qualitatively, the whole phase space structure.

The residue’s absolute value (see Eq.(76)) of hyperbolic periodic points increases expo-
nentially with the order of periodicity m. This exponential increase imposes clear restrictions
on the practical possibility of numerical localization of the higher order hyperbolic periodic
points. The localization of periodic points approaching an invariant circle is facilitated by
a - let us say a continuity principle, as follows. Consider the residue of a sequence of chain
of elliptic or hyperbolic points, convergents of an irrational, generic, KAM barrier : then
the residues of periodic orbits will approach the residues of the invariant circle, i. e. will
approach to zero (Greene’s conjecture [14]). In any neighborhood of an invariant circle there
are elliptic and direct hyperbolic points.

A quite inverse phenomenon occurs at half-permeable barriers, the Cantori, where the

9.1 Methods for computing periodic points (theoretical aspects)

We precise that in the following, the angular coordinate (denoted by x1) will not be a
priori reduced modulo 1, despite the fact that in the numerical calculations, for an increased
numerical accuracy, we separately represent the integer and the factional part of the angular
variables. After each iteration, the integer and fractional parts of the angle are computed
and stored separately.

For our purpose, in order to ﬁnd a periodic point of order of periodicity m and q = m/n,

we must solve a system of a nonlinear equation, like

x1 = T M1( x1, x2)
x2 = T M2( x1, x2)

n

−

(124)

where T M = T m is the m times iterate of the original map T . The ﬁrst equation simply
expresses the fact that the mth iterate T M1(x1, x2) of the angular coordinate has the same
value as the initial one (x1) but increased by the integer number n of periodic points.

The problem of localizing periodic orbit is reduced to solving a system of nonlinear equa-

tions.

More generally, we can consider the following problem: elaborate an algorithm for solving

the system of N nonlinear equations

Fi(x) = Fi(x1, x2, ..xN ) = 0

(1

i

N )

≤

≤

(125)

by using the values of the functions F1, F2, ..., FN .

There are a lot of numerical methods for solving systems of nonlinear equations. Because
of the large roundoﬀ errors we are obliged to choose a very rapidly convergent method.
We chose the Fletcher-Reeves minimizing method because it has a very rapid convergence
(double exponential) and a basin of attraction which is large enough.

77

Well known iterative methods seem to be not appropriate for our aim. Consider for
instance the traditional Newton iterative method [77]. It is known to converge quadratically
(near the exact root, the number of signiﬁcant digits approximately doubles at each step) if
the initial point is chosen in the basin of attraction of the root, but the global convergence
properties are very poor and unpredictable [77]. The basin of attraction is usually a fat
fractal set whose boundary can be very near the root, so that the choosing the initial point
is a real problem.

In our explicit computations, for higher periodic points (of periodicity m > 100), the
domain of attraction (convergence) reduces so much that it appears very diﬃcult to localize
it (as diﬃcult as to ﬁnd the periodic point itself).

There also exist numerical methods which converge exponentially but which have a much

larger basin of attraction than the Newton method: minimizing methods for instance.

9.1.1 Minimizing methods

The initial problem, that of solving the system (125), is equivalent to minimizing the function
f deﬁned by

f (x) =

(Fj(x))2.wj

(126)

N

j=1
X

The weights wj are positive and are chosen according to dimensionality and relative precision
criteria. In our case we simply choose wi = 1 .

Like in the case of solving nonlinear, non-algebraic equations, there exist only iterative
minimization methods, which ﬁnd the relative minimum closest to the starting point. The
determination of an appropriate starting point will be a separate problem.

The most eﬃcient minimization methods make use as much as possible of the diﬀeren-

tiability properties of the functions to be minimized (called the ”objective function”).

We will consider only this class of methods. In all of this class of methods, the important
step is considered to be the choice of a direction, along which the one-dimensional minimiza-
tion is performed, starting from a previous approximation. How to make the most eﬃcient
one directional minimization, is usually not treated in the literature. In contrast, we will
treat these two problem together.

Let d = (d1, ..., dN ) be a direction, and let a = (a1, ..., aN ) be some approximation of the
minimum point, to be improved. Let us consider the following function of a single variable
t:

where f is given by (126) and

9.1.2 The Laplace method

The oldest method is the Laplace, or the so-called steepest descent method. The Laplace
method consists in the following choice

d =

(∇f )x=a

−

(130)

such that G′(t = 0) < 0 and that G decreases along positive values of t, at least at the
beginning. A Laplace iteration consists in ﬁnding the minimum t1 along this direction, in
(∇f )x=a1 by
moving to this new point a1= a + d.t1, in computing a new direction d1=
(130) in the new point and in repeating this procedure up to desired precision is reached.

−

Clearly this method cannot be the best one because it is not invariant with respect to
the coordinate changes, even for linear transforms: from (127) d must be a contravariant
vector, while from (130) it is a covariant one. This lack of invariance appears more clearly in
the case where the xi variable components are physical quantities of diﬀerent kind, so that
this Laplace method cannot be optimal. Nevertheless, the method works exactly, if f (x) is
of the form

f (x) = g1(x1) + .. + gN (xN )

(131)

where the gi are functions of a single variable.

Another drawback of the Laplace method is related with the fact that even in the case
where f (x) is a polynomial of second order, it remains approximative, i.e.
it requires an
inﬁnite number of iterations to reach the exact result; excepted in the case where it is of the
λ)/(Λ + λ)) where
form (131). Even worse, the rate of convergence is of the order O((Λ
Λ and λ are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the associated quadratic form (they
are nonnegative, otherwise the minimum would be

). If Λ

≫

−

The above mentioned problems can be solved by another class of methods, known as

”conjugated direction method” ( the etymology will be explained below).

9.1.3 Conjugated direction method

The methods in this class have the following properties:

A) If f (x) is a second order polynomial, then the method is exact in N steps .
B) For computing the directions of successive one-dimensional minimizations, at most

the ﬁrst order derivatives are used.

An important consequence of property A) is the very quick rate of convergence, in the

general, nondegenerate case: the error decreases like

−
where k is a positive constant depending on initial guess and p.N is the total number of
iterations.

O(exp(

k.2p))

(132)

This conjugated direction method consists in :
(i) approximating locally, at each iteration step, the objective function by a second order

(ii) ﬁnding a linear change of variables so that this polynomial becomes of the form of

polynomial

(131).

79

The step (ii) is equivalent to ﬁnding a new coordinate system, generated by the conju-

gated directions d1, d2, ..., dN obtained by the N successive minimizations, such that

(133)

where Q is the Hessian matrix, i.e.
is the matrix of the second order derivatives of the

approximation of the objective function to be minimized can be written as

The relation (133) expresses the orthogonality

rically this means that in the new coordinate system, deﬁned by the conjugated directions
(see below how to generate these ones), the level surfaces (let us say in 3 dimensions) are
homothetic ellipsoids, with the same center, proportional semi-axis, and axes along coordi-
nate axes. The conjugated directions are the coordinate axes. Clearly, the minimum (the
center) is reached by a succession of 3 steps, minimizing along coordinates.

−

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

From the above explanation it follows that the 2d order Taylor expansion term in Eq.
(134) of the objective function generates (locally) a natural, canonical Euclidean geometry,
in the space of variables which can be of very diﬀerent signiﬁcance.

Remark: Unfortunately, all of these general purpose algorithms are local. They require
an initial point to start in order to ﬁnd some local minimum in the neighborhood ( in fact
a basin of attraction or ” hydrographic basin” to which the initial point belongs; their
boundaries are regular, not fractal like the basin of convergence of the Newton iterations).

9.1.4 The Fletcher-Reeves method

There are diﬀerent ways to generate the conjugated directions. For most of applications
the optimal one is the so called Fletcher-Reeves method
[78]. The optimality refers to
the reduced number of operations and storage requirement of order O(N ) to generate the
conjugated directions, by a recursive process, using the gradients of the objective function.

One main iterative step (which minimizes exactly a quadratic function) consists in N
sub-steps. Each sub- step, indexed by k, denoted by Sk consists in the following operations.
Denote by x0 the point obtained in previous step or just the initial guess of the minimum
point, by d0, the ﬁrst conjugated direction.

Sub-step S0 : At the ﬁrst substep (k = 0 ) we take

d0 =

f (x0)

(136)

−∇
Compute the point x1 by minimizing the function f (x0 + t. d0) = ψ0(t) with respect to
variable t. This is performed here by using simply the Newton method (see next Section).
Let the optimal value be t∗. Then x1 = x0 + t∗. d0

Suppose we performed the sub-steps S0 , ..., Sk, let dk the direction computed in sub-step

Sk and let xk+1 be the point reached at the end of sub-step Sk.

Sub-step Sk+1 (k < N )
direction, dk+1, is computed, according to:

Then we ﬁnd the new point xk+2 by minimizing the function

xk+2 = xk+1 + t∗. dk+1

with respect to the t variable, and using the optimal value t∗. Then we compute xk+2 by

These sub-steps are continued recursively, while the sub-steps S0 , S1, ... , SN −1 are
executed. After performing the sub-step SN −1 the iteration step is completed and the
approximate minimum point xN is reached. If the objective function is a quadratic one,
the point xN is the exact minimum point, reached just in ONE iteration step, with N
sub-steps. If the objective function is not quadratic, then we go to the next iteration step,
by using for starting point at sub-step S0 the last obtained point xN , until the required
precision is reached.

It was proved in [78] that the so-computed directions are really conjugated to each other,

i.e. they satisfy (133).

We have used this method to ﬁnd periodic points, but by applying moreover some
improvement in the most frequent (consequently the most time-consuming) steps like the
one-dimensional minimization.

9.1.5 The necessity to improve the one-dimensional minimization

By Eq.(132) - where p is the number of full iteration steps (each step involving N
substeps)-, the speed of convergence is very high, let us say like a double exponential
(exponential of exponential in the number of iterations). In contrast, if we use for the one-
dimensional minimization only the values of the function (f (xk + t. dk) = ψ(t)) and of the
ﬁrst order derivatives, the speed of convergence in the one-directional Newton minimization
is only (simply) exponential. Consequently the overall convergence will be slowed down to
simple exponential rate.

The general minimization problem for the function f (xk + t. dk) = ψk(t) (139) can be

reduced to solving the equation

and by Newton method one obtains ψ′
ti) = 0 which requires to compute
the second order partial derivatives of the objective function. If we can compute ψ”(t), then

k(ti).(ti+1 −

k(ti)+ ψ′′

ψ′

k(t) = 0

(141)

81

the one-dimensional optimization can be accelerated by the one-dimensional Newton method
which gives:

ti+1 = ti −

k(ti)/ψ′′
ψ′

k(ti)

(142)

where the index i labels the Newton iterations at substep k.
In the neighborhood of an
optimal point its convergence is very fast, i.e double exponential with respect to the number
of Newton iterations.

Nevertheless in our problem, concerning high order periodic points, this method is very
diﬃcult to use: in order to compute ψ′′(tk) we must compute the second order derivatives
of the m
times iterated map T (the Tokamap for instance [16]), which leads not only to
a complicated program, but rather to a very CPU time-consuming program in the case of
large values of m.

−

9.2 The improved one-dimensional minimization

We will see how to avoid the computation of second order derivatives, without destroying
the double exponential convergence. This is the main improvement we bring to the Fletcher-
Reeves method. Such a ”trick” works only in the case of the minimization problems arising
from the reduction method, discussed above: we will suppose that the functional to be
minimized is of the form of Eq. (126). Let ψ(t) be one of the functions ψk(t), and d one of
the directions dk.

ψ(t) = f (x + t. d)

(143)

where the vector d is one of the conjugated directions. Then

to the computation of the products of Jacobi matrices. On the other hand, the second

(149)

where the dk+1,l are deﬁned from the lth component (l = 1, 2, ..., N ) of the vector at step
k + 1, i.e. from:

dk+1 = (dk+1,1, ..., dk+1,l, ..., dk+1,N )

(150)

In the rest, the steps follows the standard Fletcher-Reeves strategy. Our modiﬁcation:
(a) preserves the same double exponential convergence speed and
(b) saves computer CPU time, for the following reasons:

(b1) we do not compute the second derivatives of Fj. These computations in the
case of periodic point search require CPU times which increase quadratically with m, the
periodicity order

(b2) we perform SINGLE iterations, instead of many (at least four) Newton iterations

at each substep. The CPU time is reduced at least by a factor of four.

(c) is not unstable, do not produce overﬂow and has larger domain of convergence,

compared to Newton method.

We observed a single drawback: the tendency to remain ”suspended” in some local

minima, for larger order periodic points (hundreds).

This problem was corrected by reﬁning the output (i.e. periodic point coordinates) of the
conjugated gradient program by another new program. This program now uses the classical
Newton method. The instability of the Newton method, mentioned above, does not show
up, because the starting point (initial guess for the Newton method) is already very close
to the solution and it is in the domain of convergence (or attraction basin).

9.2.2 General strategy for periodic point search (programming details)

In order to localize a periodic points of periodicity m and having a given type (n, m) we
must realize the following steps:

1) to ﬁnd an initial point for the minimizing method.
This is achieved in our program by a preliminary search for the absolute minimum of the
objective function on a ﬁnite grid inside the input tetragon. The coordinates of the grid’s
point giving the lowest value serve as input for conjugated gradient search.

The vertices of this tetragon, for the lowest order periodic points, are obtained from
preliminary graphics of tokamap phase portrait. For highest order, the input tetragon was
obtained recurrently form previous lowest order periodic points.

2) to minimize the objective function, using the improved Fletcher-Reeves method, with

the starting point determined by 1).

For this we used a C++ program which contains the improved Fletcher-Reeves method.
If the output error of the conjugate gradient program is too large (as compared with a
maximal imposed error), the results can be reﬁned by the Newton iteration program, the
input of which is the output of previous program.

The output of the program contain: the coordinates of the searched periodic point.

83

The program computes the safety factor related to the magnetic axis (i.e. m and n)
and the error (by comparing the initial and ﬁnal positions of the chain of periodic points).
The cross-check of numerical ﬂoating-point accuracy is the deviation of the value of the
determinant of the Jacobi matrix from its known unity value (in the output it is named as
”determinant” error). The complete program ﬁles can be obtained by sending a mail to one
of the authors 5.

The ﬁrst program computes the safety factor related to the magnetic axis, i.e. m and n.

This program, with simple modiﬁcations, can be used in diﬀerent cases, in order:

a) to ﬁnd periodic points of 2 dimensional maps,
b) to solve general nonlinear system of equations,
c) in case of ﬁeld-line tracking, to ﬁnd the periodic ﬁeld lines. In this case the diﬀerential
equations of the ﬁeld lines must be completed with the so called Jacobi variational equations
(i.e. the linearized equations), or more generally

d) to ﬁnd the periodic trajectories of the dynamical systems with ﬁnite degree of freedom,

described by discrete iterative maps or by diﬀerential equations.

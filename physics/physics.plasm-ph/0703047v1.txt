An electron injector concept for laser-plasma accelerator was developed in ref [1] and [2] ; it
relies on the use of counter-propagating ultrashort laser pulses.
In [2], the scheme is as follows:
the pump laser pulse generates a large amplitude laser wakeﬁeld (plasma wave). The counter-
propagating injection pulse interferes with the pump laser pulse to generate a beatwave pattern.
The ponderomotive force of the beatwave is able to inject plasma electrons into the wakeﬁeld. We
have studied this injection scheme using 1D Particle in Cell (PIC) simulations. The simulations
reveal phenomena and important physical processes that were not taken into account in previous
models. In particular, at the collision of the laser pulses, most plasma electrons are trapped in the
beatwave pattern and cannot contribute to the collective oscillation supporting the plasma wave. At
this point, the ﬂuid approximation fails and the plasma wake is strongly inhibited. Consequently,
the injected charge is reduced by one order of magnitude compared to the predictions from previous
models.

An intense laser pulse can drive an electrostatic plasma
a2,
wave via the ponderomotive force which scales as
where a is the normalized potential vector of the laser
10−10λ[µm]I 1/2
[W.cm−2] for a lin-
:
early polarized laser. When the pulse duration is close
to the plasma period (λp/c), the laser pulse ponderomo-
tive force pushes electrons and eﬃciently creates charge
separation (ions hardly move). It results in a travelling
longitudinal wave whose phase velocity vp is equal to the
group velocity of the laser. In an underdense plasma, vp
is very close to c, the speed of light, thus enabling accel-
eration of electrons to very high energies once they are
trapped in the wake [3]. But in a linear or moderately
nonlinear regime, an electron with no initial velocity is
not trapped by this travelling wave and consequently, not
accelerated. In a more nonlinear regime, transverse wave
breaking eﬀects can result in the self-trapping of electrons
in the so-called ”bubble regime” [4]. This phenomenon
has been observed in 2004 in [5, 6, 7] where quasi mo-
noenergetic electron beams at the 100 MeV level were
obtained. Nevertheless, in this scheme, self-injection and
acceleration depend on the precise evolution of the laser
pulse. Therefore, a ﬁne control over the output electron
beam is hard to achieve. On the contrary, precise control
of electron injection would translate into good tailoring of
the electron beam parameters, and would be most useful
for applications [8, 9].

To trap electrons in a regime where self-trapping does
not occur, one has to externally inject electrons in the
plasma wave, i.e. give electrons an initial momentum.
In addition, electrons should be injected in a short time
(< λp/c) in order to produce a monoenergetic beam.
This can be achieved using additional ultrashort laser
pulses whose purpose is only restricted to triggering elec-
tron injection. Umstadter et al. [10] ﬁrst proposed to use
a second laser pulse propagating perpendicular to the
pump laser pulse. The idea was to use the radial pon-

deromotive kick of the second pulse to inject electrons.
Esarey et al. [1] proposed a counter-propagating geome-
try based on the use of three laser pulses. This idea was
further developed in Ref. [2], where only two laser pulses
are necessary. In this scheme, a main pulse (pump pulse)
with maximum amplitude a0 creates a high amplitude
plasma wave and collides with a secondary pulse of lower
maximum amplitude a1. The interference of the two
beams creates a ponderomotive beatwave pattern with
phase velocity vbw = 0, and thus enables to preaccel-
erate background electrons. Upon interacting with this
ﬁeld pattern, some background electrons gain enough mo-
mentum to be trapped in the main plasma wave and then
accelerated to high energies. The force associated with
this ponderomotive beatwave scales as Fbw = 2k0a0a1,
where k0 is the central wavenumber of both pulses, Fbw
is many times greater than the ponderomotive force as-
0 since in an
sociated with the pump laser Fpond
underdense plasma k0 >> kp. Therefore, the mechanism
is still eﬃcient even for modest values of a0 and a1. As
the overlapping of the lasers is short in time, the elec-
trons are injected in a very short distance and can be
accelerated to an almost monoenergetic beam. This con-
cept has been recently validated in an experiment [11],
using two counter-propagating pulses. Each pulse had a
duration of 30 fs at full width half maximum (FWHM),
with a0 = 1.3, a1 = 0.4. They were propagated in a
1018cm−3 corre-
plasma with electron density ne = 7
sponding to γp = k0/kp = 15.
It was shown that the
collision of the two lasers could lead to the generation of
stable quasi-monoenergetic electron beams. The beam
energy could be tuned by changing the collision position
in the plasma.

The precise understanding of these experiments, as
well as the optimization of this process, motivate the
present study. We have used 1D Particle in cell (PIC)
simulations to model electron injection in the plasma

wave at the collision of the two lasers, and their sub-
sequent acceleration. The PIC simulations are compared
to existing models [1] and show major diﬀerences, such
as the plasma ﬁelds behavior and the amount of injected
charge.

We ﬁrst describe the ﬂuid model developped in Ref.
[1, 2]. In the linear approximation the wakeﬁeld poten-
tial (due to charge separation) is a superposition of three
potentials [12] : Φ = Φ0 + Φ1 + Φb. Φ0,1 are the charge
separation potentials driven by the laser pulses a0,1, Φ0
representing the main accelerating structure we want to
inject electrons in, and Φb is driven by the beatwave. The
normalized expressions of the wakeﬁelds φi = eΦ/mc are
given by :

where ξ0,1 = z
vpt stands for the phase relative to
the pump and injection lasers, kp is the plasma wavevec-
tor and brackets < . > denote the time-average over
the fast varying scale (1/(k0c)). The term < a0.a1 >
is the beatwave, appearing only during the collision of
the two lasers. Its spatial scale is given by 2k0, for ex-
ample for circularly polarized lasers we have a0.a1 =
a0(r, ξ0)a1(r, ξ1) cos(2k0z).

The ﬁrst approximation of this analytical model con-
sists of neglecting the last term, φb. This is supported
by the fact that the density variation linked with this
electrostatic potential scales as δnb/n = 4k2
pφb with
k0/kp >> 1. This density variation being limited to
δnb/n ⋍ 1 even in a non-linear regime, the potential can
not be greater than φb ⋍ k2
p/4k2
0 which is often negligible
compared to the other terms scaling as φ0,1 ⋍ a2

0,1.

The second assumption is that we can separate the
dynamics of the particles inside and outside the beat-
wave because the timescales are diﬀerent (i.e. an elec-
tron will see a constant wakeﬁeld during an oscillation
in a beatwave bucket). An underlying hypothesis here
is that there are two diﬀerent species of electrons, those
maintaining the wakeﬁeld, or ﬂuid electrons, and those
being trapped in the beatwave, or test electrons.

Starting from these hypothesis, one can even build an
analytical model when the lasers have modest intensities
(a0 < 1) and are circularly polarized. In that case, the
beatwave pattern is time independent. Using this an-
alytical model, one can ﬁnd an analytical threshold for
trapping ([1, 2]) : 2√a0a1
uz(ξ0min) where uz(ξ0min) is
the minimum normalized longitudinal momentum pz/mc
for which the electrons can be trapped in the wakeﬁeld.
The experiments described in ref[11] operated well above
this threshold.

A numerical implementation of this model is a par-
ticle tracking code [2] where test particles are pushed
in prescribed ﬁelds. The plasma ﬁelds are given by
Epl =
(Φ0 + Φ1) and the laser ﬁelds are solutions

of the paraxial wave equation with a linear plasma re-
sponse (gaussian beams). As expected, this model shows
good agreement with the analytical model in the circu-
lar polarization case and allows to extend the scheme to
the linear polarization case for which analytical theory
is untractable. For linear polarization, the beatwave has
a fast varying time dependence, which leads to stochas-
tic eﬀects [13]. In that case, the trapping thresholds are
even lower.

The main results of this model, that we will later on re-
fer to as the ”prescribed ﬁelds” model, are that electrons
can be injected with modest values of a0 and a1 (linear
regime). The resulting bunch is quasi-monoenergetic be-
cause all the electrons are injected in a short distance
(where the beating occurs). Moreover, the charge is ex-
pected to be up to some hundreds of pC in the linear
regime. 1D PIC simulations, where ﬁelds are linked to
the motion of electrons, have also already been carried
out [14]. They conﬁrmed that an electron beam with low
energy spread, low emittance and short bunch length can
be obtained with modest values of a0 and a1.

Here we compare 1D PIC simulations with a 1D pre-
scribed ﬁeld model.
In this later model, we have used
the 1D nonlinear theory of wakeﬁeld generation to be
able to compare the results in a more nonlinear regime
(1 < a0 < 2). The corresponding equation writes [15]:

FIG. 1: Longitudinal electric ﬁeld computed at diﬀerent times
in PIC simulation (thick solid line), and in prescribed ﬁelds
simulation (dotted line).

1D PIC simulations were carried out with the code
CALDER [16]. For all the simulation results presented
here, we have used a simulation box of 6400 cells, each cell

measuring 0.1/k0. Both lasers were gaussian pulses with
30f s duration at FWHM and wavelength λ0 = 0.8µm.
To avoid edge eﬀects, the main pulse entered the plasma
through a density ramp of 100µm, the maximum density
1018cm−3. The simulation box was kept ﬁxed
being 7
to let the laser pulses enter the simulation correctly and
we otherwise used a moving window to follow the main
pulse over long propagation distances..

Fig. 1 shows the time evolution of the longitudinal
electric ﬁeld in 1D PIC simulations when the polariza-
tions of the two pulses are parallel (solid line), compared
to the ﬁelds externally speciﬁed by equation (3) (dot-
ted line), for a0 = 2 and a1 = 0.4. The electric ﬁeld is
given in linear wave breaking ﬁeld unit Ep = cmeωp/e
corresponding here to Ep = 250GV/m. The pump pulse
propagates from left to right. We have also plotted the
transverse electric ﬁeld (thin dotted line) to show the po-
sition of the laser pulses. The collision occurs at z = 0
at time t = 0. Fig.1.a shows the electric ﬁeld 40 fs before
the collision, it ﬁts very well with the solution of equa-
tion (3). During the collision of the two beams (Fig.1.b)
we clearly see a small spatial scale pattern at 2k0, cre-
ated by the beatwave. However, in this non-linear regime
(δnb/n ⋍ 1) we do not observe a superposition of this
pattern with the usual wakeﬁelds as is the case in ref
[12]. The most remarkable feature is the strong distor-
sion of the plasma wave at the position where the two
pulses collide. This distorsion remains after a long time
(Fig.1.c, 1.d) and a numerical estimate shows that the
plasma wave amplitude is decreased by a factor of 10 at
this position.

FIG. 2: Typical trajectories of electrons in phase space. a):
Pump laser only, linear polarization (a0 = 2); b): Pump and
injection lasers, parallel linear polarizations (a0 = 2 and a1 =
0.4). c): Pump laser only, circular polarization (a0 = 2/√2);
d): Pump and injection lasers, circular polarizations (a0 =
2/√2 and a1 = 0.4/√2)

This decrease of the wakeﬁeld amplitude follows from
the fact that the electrons experiencing the collision of
the lasers are trapped in the beatwave buckets and hence
do not respond coherently (ﬂuid-like) to the ponderomo-

3

tive force of the main pulse. Without this ﬂuid hypoth-
esis, equation (3) fails. It would still hold if only some
electrons were trapped, but here, as the phase velocity of
the beatwave is zero, all electrons are trapped and kinetic
eﬀects cannot be treated as a perturbation.

−

To better understand this plasma wave ”damping”, we
have performed simulations where test electrons are sub-
mitted to the laser ﬁelds in vacuum. In particular, this
allows to understand electron motion in the ponderomo-
tive beatwave. Results of these simulations are plotted
in ﬁgure 2 where we represent the orbits of test electrons
in (z
z0, pz) phase space. Electrons are initially taken
at rest, their initial position z0 is randomly distributed
around the collision position. Fig. 2.a illustrates the tra-
jectories of electrons experiencing the pump laser ﬁeld
only (with a0 = 2) : in the laser reference frame, every
electron has the same motion because they are pushed by
the same ponderomotive force. This ﬂuid motion leads
to the charge separation which drives the electrostatic
ﬁeld known as the plasma wave. On the contrary, when
a parallel polarized injection beam is included, trajec-
tories are drastically modiﬁed (Fig.2.b). Electrons are
locally trapped in beatwave buckets, there is no large
scale charge separation and hence the plasma wake is no
longer excited. This wake inhibition phenomenon also
occurs for circularly polarized lasers as shown in Figs.2.c
and 2.d. This demonstrates that the plasma wave distor-
sion is not related to the stochastic motion of electrons,
but really to their trapping in the beatwave buckets.

We now investigate the consequences of this plasma
wake inhibition on the features of the electron beam. Fig-
ure 3 shows the energy of the electron beam versus their
phase with respect to the laser (main plots) as well as the
corresponding spectra (inserts) 300 µm after the collision
of the two beams. Fig.3.a corresponds to the prescribed
ﬁeld simulation and Fig.3.b corresponds to the 1D PIC
simulation. Qualitative diﬀerences on the energy spectra
are only minor, both spectra showing a peaked distri-
bution around 45 MeV. Electrons are trapped mainly in
the ﬁrst wakeﬁeld bucket, and less than ten percent are
trapped in the next ones. However, depending on the
model, the trapped charge diﬀers by almost one order of
magnitude.

In the prescribed ﬁelds model, electrons are preaccel-
erated in the beatwave. As their initial velocity is lower
than the wakeﬁeld phase velocity, they slip backward in
phase. They are then trapped in the wakeﬁeld provided
the energy gained in the beatwave was suﬃcient. In that
case, electrons catch up with the plasma wave and are
accelerated to high energies. In the more realistic PIC
simulation, the beatwave preaccelerates electrons in the
same way but the wakeﬁeld is inhibited and most elec-
trons just slip back in phase space without being trapped.
In order to be trapped, electrons need to be preacceler-
ated at the end of the collision. As they slip back slower
in phase space than ﬂuid electrons, they witness a re-
stored wakeﬁeld suitable for trapping and acceleration
when they reach the back of the pump pulse. Therefore,

the plasma wake inhibition reduces the phase space vol-
ume of injected particles. This leads to lower trapped
charge and to a lesser extent, to a smaller energy spread
in the PIC simulation.

Figure 4 shows a more complete comparison of the
charge obtained in both simulations (logarithmic scale),
with a0 varying beetween a0 = 0.9 and a0 = 2. Here,
a0 = 0.9 corresponds to the trapping threshold. The

In conclusion, although the previous modelling of the
collision of two laser pulses in an underdense plasma gives
a good understanding of the general processes at play in
the injection of electrons, we have observed and explained
an important physical process neglected to date. Using
1D PIC simulations, we have shown that the beatwave
does not only preaccelerate electrons but also reduces the
wakeﬁeld amplitude. In this process, the trapped charge
decreases by an order of magnitude and to a lesser extent,
the energy spread can be improved. Further studies will
focus on minimizing this eﬀect and increasing the injected
charge.

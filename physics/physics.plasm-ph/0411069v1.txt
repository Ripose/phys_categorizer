Abstract.

The laser induced plasma in liquid hasn’t been studied enough. In liquid, the laser
induced plasma may be able to resolve the hazardous material called the environment
material. Then, the plasma produced in liquid by the laser light is studied and the
plasma development is observed by a streak camera. The ultra pure water or the
ultra pure water with a melted NaCl is used as a test liquid. The liquid plasma is
produced by the fundamental wave of YAG laser. When NaCl concentration is varied,
the plasma development behavior is obserbed by streak camera. The liquid plasma
develops backward. The plasma is produced from many seeds and It consists of a group
of plasmas. However, the liquid plasma produced by second harmonic wave of YAG
laser develops as a single plasma. The development mechanism is investigated from
the growth rate of backward plasma. The backward plasma develops by breakdown
wave and radiation supported shock wave.

1. Introduction

When the laser light is focused at the solid or gas, a hot and dense plasma can be
easily produced. Many studies of laser induced plasma with solid or gas targets have
been down.[1, 2, 3, 4] However, the laser induced plasma in liquid hasn’t been studied
enough and the plasma development mechanisms have not almost been investigated. In
liquid, the laser induced plasma may be able to resolve the hazardous material called
the environment material. Then, the basic research of the plasma produced in liquid by
the laser light is done and the development behavior of liquid plasma is observed by a
streak camera.

2. Experimental arrangement

The experiment arrangement to measure the plasma development behavior is
shown in Fig. 1. The maximum laser power of YAG laser is 340 mJ with a wavelength
of 1064 nm and a pulse half width of 15 ns. Moreover, the YAG laser is able to drive
the second harmonic oscillation with a power of 180 mJ, a wavelength of 532 nm and a
pulse half width of 15 ns. The ultra pure water or the ultra pure water with a melted

NaCl is used as a test liquid. The YAG laser light is focused in liquid from the out side
of the chamber using the lens of the focal length 70 mm. The diameter of focal spot is 93
µm for the fundamental wave. On the other hand, it is 54 µm for the second harmonic
wave. The laser power is controlled using the optical ﬁlter. The plasma development is
observed using the streak camera.

3. Development behavior

3.1. Streak images

The typical streak images of the liquid plasma are shown in Fig. 2. The YAG
laser is operated at 1064 nm or 532 nm. The plasma produced in liquid develops only
backward because the plasma frequency is higher than the laser frequency and laser light
is absorbed at only backward plasma surface. The plasma consists of a group of plasmas
produced from many seeds, which is produced by the fundamental wave. On the other
hand, the plasma produced by the second harmonic of YAG laser is produced at the
focal spot and develops backward as single plasma. The reason why the development
behavior is diﬀerent has not been understood well yet. The development of backward
plasma was divided in two parts that is part 1 and part 2. Part 1 is fast development
velocity started from focal spot, and part 2 is slow development velocity following with
part 1. The backward development is compared with the theory.

3.2. Plasma number

The number of backward plasma produced by fundamental wave of YAG laser
is shown in Fig 3. The number of backward plasma increases with increasing NaCl
concentration. On the other hand, when the light intensity is exceeded a breakdown
threshold, the number of plasma increases rapidly with increasing light intensity. The
electrolytes in liquid as seed may initiate the plasma production.

4. backward plasma development velocity

4.1. Theoretical calculation

The backward plasma development produced in liquid is theoriticaliy calculated.
In high pressure gas, the backward plasma develops by breakdown wave and radiation
supported shock wave. We thought the plasma induced in liquid develops same
mechanism in high-pressure gas.

g W 1/2tan−1α

These expressions show the theoretical development velocity of backward plasma in
high-pressure gas. Where vb shows development velocity of the breakdown wave, vr one
of the radiation supported shock wave, W the laser power and ng the atomic density.

The expression of breakdown wave shows that the development velocity is proportional
to the 1/2 power of the density and the laser power, and the radiation supported shock
wave is proportional to the −1/3 power of the density and the 1/3 power of the laser
power.

4.2. Experimental data

The NaCl concentration dependence on backward development velocity in part 1
is shown in Fig. 4. The development velocities by fundamental wave is proportional to
the 1/2 power. On the other hand, the development velocity by second harmonic wave
is proportional to the −1/3 power of the density below 1 % and it is proportional to the
1/2 power of the density over 1 %. This result shows that the development mechanism
of the plasma in liquid diﬀers by the NaCl solution. The backward plasma development
in part 2 may be diﬀusion because it does not depend except the NaCl concentration
dependence.

5. conculusion

The laser induced plasma in liquid hasn’t been studied enough and the plasma
development mechanisms have not almost been investigated. In liquid, the laser induced
plasma may be able to resolve the hazardous material called the environment material.
Then, the basic research of the plasma produced in liquid by the laser light is done.

Development behavior of liquid plasma is observed by streak camera. The plasma
produced by fundamental YAG laser light consists of a group of plasmas. The plasma
produced by second harmonic wave develops as a single plasma. The liquid plasma
develops by breakdown wave and radiation supported shock wave same as development
mechanisum of high-pressure plasma.

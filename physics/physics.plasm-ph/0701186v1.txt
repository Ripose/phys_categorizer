The eﬀect of laser focusing conditions on the evolution of relativistic plasma waves in laser wake-
ﬁeld accelerators is studied both experimentally and with particle-in-cell simulations. For short focal
length (w0 < λp) interactions, beam break-up prevents stable propagation of the pulse. High ﬁeld
gradients lead to non-localized phase injection of electrons, and thus broad energy spread beams.
However for long focal length geometries (w0 > λp), a single optical ﬁlament can capture the ma-
jority of the laser energy, and self-guide over distances comparable to the dephasing length, even
for these short-pulses (cτ ≈ λp). This allows the wakeﬁeld to evolve to the correct shape for the
production of the monoenergetic electron bunches, as measured in the experiment.

PACS numbers:

The concept of using lasers to accelerate particles to
relativistic energies in plasma [1] has been brought closer
to practical realization by recent experimental results.
These have demonstrated the production of relativis-
tic electron beams with high energies [2, 3], low energy
spread [4, 5, 6] and low emittance [7]. These accelera-
tors promise to revolutionise the many uses of such par-
ticle beams, due to their high accelerating ﬁelds and thus
compact size. Of the numerous laser based schemes for
plasma accelerators [1, 8], only the laser wakeﬁeld ac-
celerator (LWFA) scheme has been capable of producing
quasi-monoenergetic electron beams [4, 5, 6]. The LWFA
consists of a high intensity laser propagating through a
plasma, such that the pulse length is shorter than the
relativistic plasma wavelength (cτ . λp = 2πc/ωp).

The longitudinal electric ﬁeld of the wakeﬁeld—a rel-
ativistic electron plasma wave, with phase velocity βphc,
generated by the ponderomotive force of the pulse—can
be used to accelerate trapped electrons. The maximum
in the cold one-
electric ﬁeld the wave can support,
1)]1/2E0, where
dimensional limit, is Emax = [2(γph −
ph)−1/2 [9]. When the
β2
E0 = mecωp/e and γph = (1
wave reaches this wavebreaking threshold, the maximum
longitudinal velocity of plasma wave electrons exceeds
βphc. Electrons are self-trapped and accelerated forward,
instead of oscillating around their initial position.

−

In multiple dimensions the self-trapping mechanism
and the wakeﬁeld dynamics can be very diﬀerent from the
one-dimensional case [10, 11, 12]. In three dimensions,
due to the large radial component of the electron trajec-
tories, wake oscillations are heavily damped [13] to the
extent that in the extreme case there is only one plasma
wave period [14]. Due to electron cavitation and ion in-
ertia, the electric ﬁelds in this wave period are approxi-
mately linear and focusing towards the centre of the ion

cavity. Electrons slipping back with respect to the pulse
are injected into the rear of the cavity where the electric
ﬁeld is strongly forward accelerating. If the charge in the
injected bunch is high enough, its own electric ﬁeld coun-
teracts that of the cavitated region, preventing further
injection and creating a short, monoenergetic bunch.

The electrons in the bunch can reach energies deter-
mined by the electric ﬁeld in the plasma wave and the
length over which the acceleration takes place. The max-
imum energy that an electron can gain is set by the de-
γ2
phλp, which is the distance before
phasing length LD ≃
the relativistic electrons out-run the accelerating phase of
the wake [8]. For this to happen the laser must propagate
at high intensity to the order of this dephasing length,
which is generally longer than its Rayleigh length, zR.

Due to the increased energy requirement and technical
diﬃculty in producing intense, ultra-short pulses, initial
LWFA studies used short focal length optics to obtain in-
tensities suﬃcient to reach the wavebreaking threshold.
(A criteria for injection is that the laser normalized vector
potential a0 = eA/mec > 4.3 [12]). However, experimen-
tal results with tight focusing have been less successful in
terms of charge, electron energy and spectral shape than
1 [4, 6].
with longer focal length focusing optics and a0
In this letter we examine the importance of the fo-
cusing geometry on the evolution of plasma waves and
laser pulse propagation in a LWF accelerator. This is
done experimentally by directly comparing laser pulse
and electron beam characteristics using two diﬀerent fo-
cusing geometries, chosen to produce either a spot of size
w0 < λp or w0 > λp for cτ . λp. We demonstrate that
for w0 > λp, self-focusing permits a0 to be suﬃciently
ampliﬁed to allow self-injection. Moreover the quasi-
static nature of this compression allows for an adiabatic
(i.e. controlled) approach to self-injection, which results

≈

in production of monoenergetic bunches. We also show
that the pulse is maintained at high intensity, through
LD, which is necessary
self-guiding, over a distance
for eﬃcient acceleration of the bunch. With shorter focal
length focusing and w0 < λp, the interaction is char-
acterized by ﬁlamented laser propagation and excessive
curvature of the plasma wave, resulting in broad electron
spectra. The experimental observations are supported by
a series of 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) code simulations.

The experiments were carried out on the Ti:Sapphire

a central wavelength λ0 = 795 nm. The laser was fo-
cused with either f /3 or f /12 oﬀ-axis parabolic mirrors,
where the f refers to the ratio of focal length to initial di-
ameter. The measured spot sizes (FWHM) at focus were

Electron beam divergence measurements were taken
with a removable lanex scintillating screen with a 5◦
opening angle. The energy spectrum of the accelerated
electrons was obtained with a magnetic spectrometer
with a 5
1 mm steel collimator. The electrons were
detected with image plates. These have a linear response
over a dynamic range of 108, 50µm spatial resolution, and
allow calibrated, single-shot acquisition of the full spec-
trum [15]. Alternatively, for the high charge monoener-
getic beams, a lanex scintillating screen was used for
high-repetition rate acquisition.

×

With both f /3 and f /12 focusing, at high density
(cτ > λp) quasi-maxwellian electron energy spectra are
observed. There is little shot-to-shot variation in spec-
trum. This is indicative of self-modulation of the pulse
[16], where the wakeﬁeld amplitude can reach the wave-
breaking threshold over multiple wave periods. This, and
the shorter dephasing length causes the large observed
energy spread, as in Fig. 1a [4]. The divergence mea-
surements show an almost uniform beam proﬁle over an
instrument limited opening angle of 5◦ as can be seen
from Fig. 1c i) and iii). Measurements taken with image
plates closer to the interaction indicate that the actual
divergence is signiﬁcantly greater than this.

When cτ . λp, the LWF regime is entered. In the case
of the f /3 the number of accelerated electrons drops dra-
matically, as can be seen in Fig. 1c ii). Coupled with the
fall-oﬀ in electron ﬂux due to the high beam divergence,
the spectrometer can no longer detect any electron signal
above noise level, even with the sensitive image plates.

sured by the electron spectrometer. However, this can
be explained by the electron beam pointing instability

The variation in energy and energy spread may also
be aﬀected by this pointing instability. The ratio of the
standard deviation to mean of the electron beam peak
energy σ/E = 0.18 for a set of 10 consecutive shots at an
electron density of 7.5

1018 cm−3 with E = 80 MeV.

Side scattered images of the interaction indicate that
the short focal length optic has a short channel length
(
zR) whilst for the long focal length they indicate ex-
∼
tended propagation. Fig. 2 shows images of the transmit-
ted light at 800nm at z = 2 mm. For the f /3 (Fig. 2a) at
all densities within the experimental range, the pulse is
broken up into multiple ﬁlaments, even when the power
for relativistic self-focusing—Pcr = 17.3(ω0/ωp)2 GW—
is exceeded, P/Pcr > 1. As the density increased the
average ﬁlament size decreased.

The lack of guiding indicates why the f /3 (w0 < λp)
cannot produce reproducible monoenergetic electrons un-
der these conditions. To produce monoenergetic electron
spectra the laser must propagate for distances on the or-

focus was used, due to the diﬃculty of initializing a pulse
similar to the real focus. The embedded gaussian of the
experimental focus was modeled to obtain similar diﬀrac-
tion and Rayleigh lengths. This corresponds to 2 µm and
10 µm beam waists, deﬁned as the half width at 1/e2
maximum at vacuum focus. Simulations with intermedi-
ate focusing geometries were also performed. The density
proﬁle consisted of a 300 µm linear ramp followed by a
plateau of density ne0 to approximate the measured den-
sity proﬁle. The pulse started outside the plasma and its
vacuum focus was set to be at the start of the plateau.

Directly after focus, the 2 µm pulse develops a com-
plex, strongly time-dependent mode structure. This elic-
its a plasma response that enhances the structure via the
self-focusing instability and evolves to a multi-ﬁlament
structure (Fig. 3a) reminiscent of the analytical solution
[19] in the stationary approximation. Only about 30% of
the pulse energy is trapped in a central ﬁlament.

By contrast the 10 µm pulse focuses radially and com-
presses temporally, capturing almost all of the initial
pulse energy (Fig. 3c). The average pulse half-width
shrinks to
4 µm, and the pulse propagates at this
width for longer than than zR, until it is depleted. Un-
like the 2 µm case, the propagation is quasi-static and
self-focusing occurs on a longer timescale.

Electron density plots are also shown (Fig. 3d, e) for
both 2 µm and 10 µm simulations at the point where the
plasma wave amplitude approaches its maximum value.
Note that this amplitude maximum is at very diﬀerent
points in the simulation for the two pulses. Overlaid are
contours of the laser a0, showing how the electron density
proﬁle directs the laser energy.

The 2 µm pulse interaction is shown close to focus af-
ter which it breaks up and the wake amplitude decreases.

is unlikely that a single ﬁlament will be able to eﬃciently
trap suﬃcient energy to generate beams of high charge
and beam quality [17] compared with those obtained us-
ing a long focal length optic.

In contrast, using the f /12 optic (Fig. 2d), the pulse
emerges as a single ﬁlament in the density range of mo-
1018 cm−3). The

self-guiding. This is in contrast to the f /3 case, where
almost all of the energy is transmitted.

For ne > 2

1019 cm−3, the spatial extent is large
again. The depletion is so severe (> 10
) that self-
guiding cannot be maintained over this length. The ob-
served extended propagation allows the necessary non-
linear pulse modiﬁcation for injection of a single mo-
noenergetic bunch of electrons. At the lowest densities
1018 cm−3), for which P/Pcr < 1, the spatial

The electron trajectories from the edge of the pulse are
attracted axially by the ion cavity produced by the in-
tense pulse. The distance to reach axis should be similar
to the distance the electrons slip back in the speed of
light frame in this time, as they are relativistic. However
the pulse length in the case of the f /3 is much longer
than the pulse width, and so the electrons move into the
pulse envelope before being repelled by the ponderomo-
tive force of the laser, as can be seen in Fig. 3d. It is this
crossing of the laser envelope by electrons that causes the
break-up of the laser pulse.

The 10 µm pulse produces an initially more gently
curved wake and reaches maximum amplitude later after
non-linear modulation has increased its intensity. Even
when the intensity is raised so that electron cavitation
occurs quickly, there is still no breakup of the pulse as
the width is similar to the pulse length.

A scan in waist (between 1 and 14 µm) was simulated
at ne0/nc = 0.01, corresponding to 0.14 < w0/λp < 2, for
a ﬁxed equivalent power, P = 13 TW. As noted above,
larger (& 6 µm) focal spots show stable quasi-static prop-
agation (Fig. 3b, c), while spot sizes < 4 µm (Fig. 3a)
show beam break-up and dynamical self-focusing. Inter-
mediate focusing geometries (
4 µm) show evidence of
a transition region between the two regimes.

An intensity scan (I0/4 6 I 6 4I0) at ﬁxed density
and a density scan 0.005 6 ne/nc 6 0.02 at ﬁxed inten-
sity were also simulated for both 2 µm and 6 µm geome-
tries. The simulations were qualitatively invariant for
both focusing geometries in this parameter range. The
simulations also show that the pulse tends to self-focus
λp and oscillate around an equilib-
to a diameter 2w0
rium position (Fig. 4). This is independent of the initial
f number, provided w0 & λp.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the self-guiding
of an ultra-short laser pulse (cτ
λp) provided the
vacuum spot-size w0 & λp. Pulses with vacuum spot-
size greater than this can propagate many zR, oscillating
about a matched spot size. However, focusing to smaller
than
λp will result in mode structures, which through
self-focusing seeded beam break-up prevent production of
high quality electron beams. So for reproducible produc-
tion of monoenergetic electron, the ratio of pulse length
to spot size should be . 1. To overcome low laser pow-
ers, increasing pulse intensity through pulse compression
and photon deceleration of the leading edge [12] is more
eﬀective than focusing more tightly. Careful choice of
spot size, striking a balance between pump depletion with
large f numbers and ﬁlamentation at low f numbers, will
increase the eﬃcacy of the interaction. This competition
between over and under-focusing will be important even
at higher intensities and so necessitates a careful choice
of focusing conditions in future experiments.

Balmer spectra are investigated which are obtained from liquid hydrogen targets irradiated by ultra-
short intense laser pulses. Starting from a general quantum statistical approach, a uniﬁed description
of bremsstrahlung, the Stark broadening and the van der Waals proﬁle of hydrogen spectral lines is
used, which allows for the inclusion of many-particle eﬀects. Analyzing the line proﬁles, a low ion-
ization degree of a dense plasma is inferred, where the main contribution to the spectral line shape
originates from the interaction with the neutral components. A consistent description of the Balmer
spectra can be given within plasma hydrodynamics describing the formation of excited atomic states
in the expanding microplasma only below a critical density. The time-integrated measured spectra
can be analysed to deduce signatures for the time-dependent temperature and density. Reasonable
agreement of observed spectra with the time evolution of the microplasma parameters in a hydro-
dynamical calculation is found.

INTRODUCTION

Spectroscopy is one of the most powerful methods in plasma diagnostics. In particular, the analysis of the shape
of spectral lines allows to determine the properties of the plasma such as temperature, density and composition. For
dense, strongly coupled plasmas, optical spectra have been investigated to infer the parameter values not only of
laboratory, but also of astrophysical plasmas, see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4] and Refs. [5, 6, 7], respectively.

The shape of spectral lines is determined by diﬀerent processes. Besides the natural line width given by the ﬁnite
lifetime of excited states, Doppler broadening is related to the thermal motion of the emitters. The inﬂuence of the
surrounding medium becomes more important at increasing density and leads to pressure broadening. A large eﬀect
is caused by charged particles in the plasma. This Stark broadening is determined by the distribution of ions as
sources of the microﬁeld, whereas the contribution of the electrons usually is treated in impact approximation [8, 9].
The Weisskopf radius can be used to distinguish between collision parameters where the collision is strong or weak.
However, also the neutral components in the surrounding medium contribute to the shape of spectral lines what is
denoted as van der Waals broadening. In general, the shape of spectral lines is characterized not only by the width,
but also the shift and asymmetry so that the full line proﬁle has to be investigated [10].

A systematic approach to the shape of spectral lines in dense plasmas has been worked out on the basis of pertur-
bation theory, and many-particle eﬀects have been incorporated. Griem [11] gives a review of diﬀerent classical and
semiclassical methods as well as the application to diﬀerent plasma line shapes. A quantum statistical approach based
on the many-particle Green functions method was presented by G¨unter [12, 13] and has been worked out systemati-
cally for charged perturbers. Special attention was payed to show the equivalence between this rigorous approach and
the aforementioned classical and semiclassical approaches in the appropriate limits. The quantum statistical approach
has been applied to a broad range of systems, e.g. hydrogen plasmas [12, 14, 15, 16], helium plasmas [17, 18] and
plasmas of other elements containing H or He like ions. In most cases, the situation of a hot and dense plasma with
a large fraction of free electrons was considered. In such systems, the main contributions to the shift and width of a
given spectral line, besides the natural line width and Doppler broadening, come from the ionic microﬁeld, caused by
ions surrounding the radiating atom or ion, collisions with free electrons, and interaction with collective excitations
in the plasma (plasmons). Theoretical results are in very good agreement with experiments, e.g. by Wilhein [19, 20].
The inﬂuence of neutral perturbers becomes dominant if the ionization degree of the partially ionized plasma is low.
Van der Waals broadening has been investigated within second order perturbation theory. Based on the derivation of
the van der Waals potential between two hydrogen atoms in their ground state as given by London [21], a red shift of
the spectral line follows as was shown by Margenau [22]. A review of van der Waals broadening is given by Traving
[23].

We show how to extend the quantum statistical approach, elaborated for the inﬂuence of charged particles on the
line proﬁle, to include also the interaction with neutral perturbers. In this way, the extension of the van der Waals

broadening by accounting for many-particle eﬀects such as dynamical screening or strong collisions is possible. A
uniﬁed description of the inﬂuence of the perturbing partially ionized plasma on the line proﬁle of a radiating atom
can be performed, treating charged particles and neutrals within the same formalism.

The theory will be applied to the investigation of optical spectra obtained from hydrogen microdroplets heated by
strong femtosecond laser pulses. So far, most of the experimental and theoretical work has concentrated on nanosized
clusters [24, 25, 26]. Studies on the light emission from these systems have focused on x–rays and EUV–radiation
[27, 28, 29], motivated by the search for novel light sources. Hydrogen as a target material has attracted considerable
attention since nuclear fusion has been demonstrated as a result of Coulomb exploding deuterium clusters [30]. Various
eﬀorts to produce micrometer sized hydrogen targets are reported, cf. e.g. Ref. [31]. Other studies on such large
systems include, e.g., the measurement of x–ray emission from Kr clusters [32] and from methanol microdroplets
[33]. An expanding microplasma can be produced with interesting parameter values. In particular, strongly coupled
plasmas are obtained, but with temperature and density changing in time. Thus, a nonequilibrium description is
necessary to follow the time evolution of the excited microplasma. On the other hand, time resolved experimental
techniques have been demonstrated to measure transient plasma properties like the evolution of the plasma density
[34, 35].

In the experiment on µm sized droplets reported here, lines of the hydrogen Balmer series are observed as distinctive
features in the optical emission spectrum. The present paper will give a ﬁrst interpretation of the recorded line shapes.
In particular we will show that a dynamical picture is necessary to describe the observed spectra, and we are able
to get information about the stages relevant for the line emission. Since the line proﬁles show a strong inﬂuence of
neutral perturbers, the van der Waals broadening is of special interest.

The work is organized as follows: In the second section we will brieﬂy outline the method of thermodynamic Green
functions with emphasis on its application to the ﬁeld of spectral line shapes. The method will be applied to the case
of a weakly ionized plasma, where the interaction among atoms is governed by the dipole-dipole term. The Margenau
result appears in the case of ground state perturbers. In the third section, our results will be compared to Balmer
spectra obtained from laser produced hydrogen microplasmas. The characteristic asymmetric red shift observed in
these experiments can be explained in terms of a van der Waals proﬁle. Parameter values for an eﬀective temperature
and density are inferred. However, an equilibrium picture cannot give a consistent description of the measured Balmer
spectra, and a dynamical picture of the expanding microplasma is demanded. In the fourth section, a hydrodynamical
description of the expanding droplet after laser excitation is given, which allows to interpret the observed spectra if
considering the time stages where excited atomic states can exist.

II. MANY-BODY THEORY OF LINE SHAPES AND VAN DER WAALS BROADENING

A. Quantum statistical approach to spectral line shapes

A quantum statistical approach to the optical spectra of dense, strongly coupled systems can be given within linear
response theory. Emission and absorption of radiation is related to the transverse dielectric function ǫtr(~k, ω). In the
optical region, the wavelength is large compared with atomic distances so that the long-wavelength limit k → 0 can
be considered. For the absorption coeﬃcient we ﬁnd

α(ω) =

Im ǫ(0, ω) ,

ω
cn(ω)

n(ω) is the refraction index, c is the velocity of light in vacuum. For k → 0 the transverse and longitudinal dielectric
function ǫ(0, ω) become identical. We consider in the following the longitudinal one.

The dielectric function for a charged particle system can be evaluated in a rigorous way using quantum statistical
methods. According to ǫ(~k, ω) = 1 − (1/ǫ0k2)Π(~k, ω), it is linked to the polarization function Π(~k, ω), for which a
systematic perturbation expansion can be given. A Green function approach to the polarization function is outlined in
App. A. Using Feynman diagrams and partial summations, appropriate approximations can be found which account
In particular, for

partially ionized plasmas a cluster decomposition Π(~k, ω) = Π1(~k, ω) + Π2(~k, ω) + . . . can be performed to give the
contribution of free carriers as well as of bound states in a systematic way [36].

is obtained. Here, fc(~p) = [exp{(Ec
p = ~2p2/2mc is the single-particle kinetic energy, and µc the chemical
(including spin) with charge ec and mass mc, Ec
potential. Within this lowest order approximation, single-particle excitations as well as collective plasmon modes are
described. The limit η → 0+ has to be performed after the summation over momenta.

The RPA contribution Π(0)

1 (~k, ω) is improved if interactions with other particles beyond mean ﬁeld are included, see
App. A. Medium eﬀects, such as collisions, dynamical screening and exchange, enter the polarization function via the
single-particle self-energies and the vertex function. The vertex function describes the in-medium coupling of particles
to the radiation ﬁeld. It has to be taken in the same approximation as the self-energy as dictated by consistency
constraints, i.e. Ward identities [37]. Going beyond the mean-ﬁeld (Hartree-Fock) approximation, collisions can be
considered in lowest order Born approximation. Higher orders lead to dynamical screening and t matrix expressions
for strong collisions. This way, the continuum of optical spectra is described, in particular inverse bremsstrahlung
[38]. However, line spectra are missing in Π1(~k, ω).

The next term in the cluster decomposition is Π2(~k, ω). It is given by the convolution of two atomic (two-particle)
propagators and describes also transitions between bound states, i.e. the line spectrum [36]. In the lowest order any
interaction with further particles are neglected. Similar to Π(0)
1 (~k, ω) given above, replacing single-particle propagators
by atomic propagators one obtains

ψα(~p) = h ~p | α i and ψα(~r) = h ~r | α i are atomic wave-functions in relative momentum representation and coordinate
representation, respectively. Eq. (5) results for me/mi → 0. In contrast to a simple chemical picture where a mixture
of free charge carriers and atoms is considered, scattering states are included, and double counting of diagrams has
to be avoided. In this approximation, one obtains the unperturbed line-spectrum of isolated atoms including the
Doppler proﬁle due to thermal motion.

As before, medium eﬀects are described by taking the self-energy of the constituents and the vertex into account,
which now are given on the two-particle level, see App. A. In the simplest approximation, the dynamically screened in-
teraction can be considered similar to the GW approximation for the single-particle propagator [39]. This dynamically
screened interaction contains the polarization function, which once more can be decomposed into the contribution of
single-particle states, two-particle states and higher cluster states. This way we obtain the dynamically screened Born
approximation for collisions with free particles or composed clusters of the partially ionized plasma. Before discussing
these contributions more in detail, we mention that the Born approximation can be improved for strong collisions
considering further terms leading to the t matrix.

In the case of dense and strongly ionized systems, the main contribution to the self-energy comes from the interaction
of the radiating atom with charged particles, i.e. electrons and ions. The inﬂuence of free particles is given by the
RPA-polarization function, i.e. the ﬁrst term in the cluster decomposition. This interaction can be inserted into the
self-energy, but the vertex-function has to be taken in the same approximation. Reducing the screened interaction to
its one-loop approximation, which amounts to the second Born approximation with respect to the statically screened
Coulomb potential, the so-called impact-approximation is obtained. Systematic improvements by taking higher order
contributions into account lead to the dynamically screening of the Coulomb potential in the case of weak collisions
and the t-matrix approach in the case of strong collisions. In particular, the contribution of collisions with electrons
to the line proﬁle in dense plasmas is treated this way, for a review see G¨unter [13].

Here, Σi, Σf denote the electronic contribution to the self-energy of the initial or ﬁnal state, respectively, Γv the vertex
contribution. The impact approximation, improving the Born approximation by accounting for dynamical screening
and strong collisions, has extensively been discussed in the literature [11].

Due to their large masses, ions are much slower than electrons. In the adiabatic limit, the ions may be considered as
a static distribution of charged particles during the process of emission. Considering diﬀerent ionic conﬁgurations in
the plasma, the distribution Wρ( ¯β) of the so-called microﬁeld ¯β = E/EHoltsmark, EHoltsmark = (4nion/15)2/3Ze/(2ǫ0),
(nion is the density of ions in the system) is introduced, and the averaging leads to the Stark proﬁle as given in Eq.
(6). Also in the case of ionic contributions, the systematic many-particle treatment leads to further improvements
such as the dynamic microﬁeld. We will not detail further the treatment of the inﬂuence of free particles on the line
shape any further in this paper, we only would give the general many-particle frame because the interaction with
bound states can be followed along the same lines.

In the next step, one has to take into account the interaction between the radiator and neutral particles (atoms),
as well. This is achieved if the bound state contribution is considered in the cluster decomposition of the polarization
function expanding the dynamically screened interaction, see App. A. In particular we will consider the two-particle
self-energy describing the inﬂuence of the medium on the radiator, where the bound state component is taken into
account in lowest approximation. We consider the second order Born approximation with respect to the unscreened
Coulomb potential to describe the interaction between neutrals. The detailed calculation is given in the next section.
Again, improvements can be obtained systematically. By calculating the dynamically screened interaction with the
polarization function up to the second term in the cluster decomposition, the interaction with free and bound particles
as well as with collective excitations could be included in a consistent way. Strong collisions can be described via the
four-particle t matrix. In addition to the self-energy term, also the vertex is modiﬁed if bound states are included.

B. Evaluation of atom-atom interaction in Born approximation

The calculation of the interaction Vα1α2 (R) between two atoms at distance R in state |α1i and |α2i, is carried out

in App. B. We obtain

Here, α3, α4 denote quantum numbers of the intermediate states. Only elastic processes are considered where the
internal quantum numbers for the initial state and the ﬁnal state are identical. Due to the ion’s heavy mass, we
neglect the contribution of kinetic energy in the intermediate propagator in comparison with the excitation energies.
Besides R which is the distance between the nuclei of the interacting atoms, ~r1 and ~r2 are vectors of position of the
two electrons of atom 1 and atom 2, respectively.

This result (7) coincides with results from second order perturbation theory. At large distances R/aB ≪ 1 we can

For hydrogen-like atoms the sum in Eq. (8) has been performed by Eisenschitz and London [21]. Their result for the

following expression for the interaction strength C6(α, 1s), can be derived, as shown in App. C,

(cid:2)
Note that there is no exchange contribution in Eq. (7), since the distance R is assumed to be large compared with
the Bohr radius. At shorter distances, the higher order terms as well as exchange terms have to be taken into account
which will diminuish the van der Waals behavior at small distances and possibly, in the case of electrons in the triplet
state, result in a repulsion due to the exchange contribution.

(cid:3)

We would like to emphasize that our approach is able to include many-particle eﬀects such as screening and strong
scattering. The simplest approximation to include many-particle eﬀects is to replace the Coulomb interaction in
Eq. (7) by a statically screened one. In a more sophisticated approximation a dynamically screened interaction can
be considered. Since we start from the elementary components of the plasma, a uniﬁed description of the inﬂuence of
free charge carriers and neutral components on the line shapes in a partially ionized plasma is possible.

Within a general approach, the contribution of the dense medium to the spectral line shape is given by the self-
energy and vertex contribution. In the ﬁrst order of interaction we have the Hartree-Fock mean ﬁeld, in second order
we obtain the impact approximation where collisions are described in Born approximation.

Within this concept, the van der Waals contribution to the self-energy is

Here, nα2 is the density of pertubing atoms in state α2. In the following, we consider the perturbing atoms in their

As already discussed in connection with the ionic contribution to the spectral line shapes, because of the large masses
the motion is slow, and we can apply the microﬁeld concept of strong interaction with a given ﬁeld distribution. The
intensity distribution of a given spectral line, due interaction between the radiator in initial and ﬁnal states |ii and
| f i, respectively and the perturber in its ground state |0i is obtained by performing an averaging procedure over the

III. EXPERIMENTS WITH LASER IRRADIATED HYDROGEN DROPLETS

A. Experimental setup

We observed emission radiation from hydrogen microplasmas, which are excited by intense femtosecond laser pulses.
Hydrogen droplets are produced by expansion of pre-cooled H gas at temperatures between 17 and 22 K through a
20 µm oriﬁce into the vacuum chamber with a backing pressure of about 8 bar. At these source conditions, liquid H
droplets of up to 10 µm in diameter leave the nozzle with a density of nliq = 4.2 · 1022 cm−3. Roughly 10 mm behind
the nozzle the droplets are irradiated by laser pulses generated in a Ti-Sapphire laser system with a wavelength
of λ0 = 810 nm and a pulse energy of Epulse = 2.5 mJ. The beam is focussed to a spot with a beam waist of
40 µm. The pulse length τ is tuned in the range of τ = 50 − 1000 fs, corresponding to laser peak intensities between
7.0 × 1015 W cm−2 and 3.5 × 1014 W cm−2.

The light emitted by the excited droplets is analyzed by a 0.34 m grating spectrometer (200 lines/mm) and monitored
with a CCD camera, providing a spectral dispersion of 0.185 nm per pixel. The entrance slit width was optimized
for a high signal, yielding a spectral resolution of ∆λ ≃ 1 nm. Two regions of the visible spectral range are analyzed
in more detail, i.e. (a) 430 . . . 500 nm, and (b) 450 . . . 700 nm. Fig. 1 shows representative emission spectra from the
laser excited H microplasmas. Elastic Rayleigh scattering of the incident radiation produces large enhancement of the

are clearly identiﬁed, i.e. Hα at λ = 656.3 nm, Hβ at λ = 486.1 nm, and Hγ at λ = 434.1 nm.

B. Analysis of the spectra

1. Eﬀective Temperatures

In order to quantitatively analyse the Balmer line signals, we have to subtract the background signal. Therefore,
the neighbouring spectral ranges of each line, i.e. 640..655 nm and 670..685 nm for the Hα line, as well as 460..467 nm
and 472..480 nm for Hβ are ﬁtted by an exponential function, which is then subtracted from the complete data set.
As an example, Figs. 2 (a) and (b) show the background subtracted spectra for the case of τ = 1000 fs as solid circles.
The solid curves are the Margenau proﬁles ﬁtted to the data; they will be discussed in more detail in Sec. III B 2.

By comparing integrated intensities from diﬀerent spectral lines, we can determine the eﬀective temperature in the
system. Given the ratio of wavelength-integrated intensities I1/I2 of two spectral lines of the same atomic species
and the same ionization stage at central wavelengths λ1 and λ2, and assuming again local thermal equilibrium, the
eﬀective line temperature is [10]

Tab. I lists eﬀective temperatures for each pulselength. As can be seen, the eﬀective line temperature is dependent
on the pulselength τ of the laser. One obtains diﬀerent results from the two ratios I(Hα)/I(Hβ) and I(Hβ)/I(Hγ).

These eﬀective temperatures have to be analysed within a microscopic description of the expanding source. Self-
absorption should be considered so that the intensities occurring in Eq. (16) are modiﬁed when propagating through
the microplasma. Furthermore, diﬀerent values T eﬀ
12 from the intensities of Hα, Hβ and Hγ indicates that the system is
in a generic non-equilibrium state, which cannot be described by a single temperature. Despite the measured spectra

8

are time integrated, we have to assume a dynamic evolution of the plasma parameters temperature and density over
the course of the expansion of the excited hydrogen droplets. Within a hydrodynamical description given below in
Sec. IV B, local thermal equilibrium with plasma parameters depending on space and time are introduced.

During the expansion process, radiation can only be produced if the upper level of the transition in question is
existent in the system so that it can be occupied. From simple geometric and energetic arguments it is clear, that
n = 3, 4, 5 levels are not present in hydrogen at liquid densities. This point will be discussed in more detail in
subsection IV C.

The continuum background steems from free-bound and free-free (bremsstrahlung) transitions. The spectral be-
havior can also be used to estimate eﬀective temperatures which should be analysed within a dynamical expansion
model. Since more experimental work is necessary to separate the continuum background radiation, we will consider
only the line spectra in this work.

2. Spectral line shapes

To analyze the line proﬁles, we ﬁrst have to consider the eﬀect of the broadening due to the ﬁnite resolution of the
experimental setup. The true line proﬁle is obtained after deconvolution with the detector function. In a separate
experiment the spectral resolution was measured as ∆λ ≃ 1 nm [41]. This is consistent with the steep increase of
intensity on the blue wing of the unperturbed spectral line.

FIG. 3: Normalized spectra near the Hα-line for τ = 1000 fs pulse length. The raw data (c.f. inset) have been summed over
diﬀerent vertical ranges. The solid line marks the central region of the laser focus (framed part in the inset), the dashed curve
corresponds to the data from the peripheric region.

On the long wavelength wing, all spectral lines show a signiﬁcant broadenening. In Fig. 3 we analyze the spectral line
shape as a function of the distance of the origin of radiation from the plasma’s center. This is achieved by integration
of the CCD-Data over diﬀerent ranges in the y-direction, cf. the inset in Fig. 3. We plot the corresponding spectra
for the central region of the laser focus (framed part in the inset) and for the peripheric region, about 100 µm beside
the focus. After background subtraction, the spectra are normalized to their maximum value. In this way it can be
seen, that the width of the spectral line depends signiﬁcantly on the spatial origin of the radiation and decreases with
increasing distance from the center. This behaviour indicates that the asymmetric broadening of the spectral lines is
related to the properties of the produced microplasma and should be described as a density eﬀect.

9

Pressure broadening of spectral lines is caused by charged perturbers as well as by neutral perturbers. As discussed
in Sec. II, free electrons are treated in impact approximation leading to a symmetric Lorentzian line proﬁle, which,
however, is smaller than the estimated resolution of about 1 nm. Also the ionic microﬁeld contributes to a Voigt
proﬁle with a broadening in the red as well as the blue direction (linear Stark eﬀect) and is also limited by the
estimated resolution. Thus we conclude that the inﬂuence of free charged particles is not clearly identiﬁed so that the
free electron density is below nfree

e = 1017 cm−3 which at T = 1 eV gives for Hα the FWHM of 1 nm.

The asymmetric red shift can be described by the interaction with neutral perturbers. We will now compare the
experimental data to the line-shape due to interaction with neutral perturbers, as outlined in Sec.II B. In Fig. 2,
we compare the measured spectra in the vicinity of the Hα line to the emission proﬁle as given by Margenau,
Eq. (14), convoluted with the detectors resolution function. In the case of the Hα-line, the best ﬁt was obtained using
natom = 4.5 · 1020 cm−3 for the density of neutrals. In the case of Hβ, the density natom = 1.8 · 1020 cm−3 gives the
minimum χ2.

As already discussed in context with the eﬀective temperatures, the diﬀerent values of the eﬀective densities con-
tradict an equilibrium picture. Despite the observed line proﬁles are time integrated, we need a dynamical description
of the expanding microplasma to explain the emission of spectral lines during this nonequilibrium process. In the
following Section we present a hydrodynamical scenario for the line emission.

IV. MODEL CALCULATIONS AND DISCUSSION

A. Energy deposition

The energy deposition inside the hydrogen droplet can be estimated from the pulse energy of the laser, Epulse ≃
2.5 mJ ≃ 1.6 · 1016 eV, the ratio of the droplet surface to the focal spotsize, i.e. (10 µm/40 µm)2 ≃ 0.06, and assuming
about 50 % absorption inside the droplet, which is initially tansparent. We obtain for the deposited internal energy
U ≃ 0.06 · 0.5 · Epulse = 4.7 · 1014 eV. By applying the ideal gas relation U = 3NatomkBT /2, we can estimate the
initial temperature of the droplet, Ti ≃ 14 eV. Here, Nat = nliqV = nliqπd3/6 = 2.2 · 1013 is the number of atoms
in the droplet. For a more detailed calculation of the initial temperature, the absorption of the laser radiation has
to be known more precisely and also the correlation and dissociation energy has to be accounted for. Ti being larger
than the eﬀective temperatures inferred from the relative line intensities in Sec. III B 1, indicates again, that we have
to consider the dynamic evolution of plasma parameters. A convenient method to describe the temporal evolution of
the droplet, is hydrodynamic modelling.

B. Hydrodynamic expansion

Hydrodynamic simulations are a versatile tool to infer the dynamics of a strongly coupled many-particle system. In
the case of plasmas, hydrocodes have been successfully applied to study these systems under the inﬂuence of strong
external ﬁelds [42] as well as the relaxation of a plasma in an excited state into equilibrium. Here, we will study
the hydrodynamic expansion of the excited, i.e. heated H microdroplet after times which are long compared to the
pulse length of the laser. Simulations are performed using the hydrocode MULTI2002 [43, 44]. As initial conditions,
we assume a homogenous density proﬁle n(r, t = 0) = nliq = 4.5 · 1022 cm−3 and also homogenous temperature
distribution with T (r, t = 0) = 14 eV. Fig. 4 shows the number density and temperature proﬁles. The uppermost
curve corresponds to t = 0.01 ns, while the last curve is taken at t = 1 ns. Both parameters n(r, t) and T (r, t) show a
fast decline in the center of the droplet. The density decreases by a factor of 10 every 300 ps. Secondly, all proﬁles are
nearly constant over a long range from the center and decrease quite fast when approaching the rim of the droplet.
Therefore, the central values n(r = 0, t) and T (r = 0, t) can be taken as representative values for the whole droplet.
The temporal evolution of the central number density and temperature is shown in Fig. 5.

The hydrodynamical description gives the time evolution of the excited droplet. The assumption of local thermal
equilibrium may be justiﬁed on the time scale of ps for the thermalisation of kinetic energies.
If we assume also
ionisation equilibrium, we can calculate the composition during the time evolution. The temporal behaviour of the
ionization is plotted in Fig. 6. For the initial conditions T = 14 eV and n = 4.2 · 1022 cm−3, we have an ionization
degree αe = nfree/n = 0.68. After t = 0.7 ns, the density and temperature have decreased so far, that the ionization
drops below 10−4. This corresponds to a concentration of free electrons of roughly 1017 cm−3. At this density, and
T ≃ 1 eV, the Stark eﬀect leads to a broadening of the Hα line of 1 nm, as was discussed in Sec. III B 2. Thus, at
times larger than 0.7 ns, Stark broadening does not give a notable contribution to the width of the spectral lines.

C. Occupation of excited levels

In a dense system, the potential energy of an electron in a given atom is modiﬁed by the medium. Thus, energy
eigenvalues and wave functions are changed due to screening by free charge carriers. In particular, it is well-known
that bound states merge with the continuum of scattering states at high densities so that the electrons are no longer

bound to a special ion, but move relatively free in the plasma as denoted by a transition from dielectric to metallic
behavior. Considering excited states, the dissolution occurs already at lower densities so that these excited states
cannot longer be occupied to produce a line spectrum.

We focus here to the inﬂuence of bound states in the medium to analyse at which densities the excited states are
dissolved into the continuum so that no line spectra are formed. In a ﬁrst approximation, we calculate the modiﬁcation
of the potential in the Schr¨odinger equation for the hydrogen atom due to the perturbing atoms in the surrounding
medium. We consider only ground state atoms and neglect the correlations between the electrons in the perturbing
ground state with the radiating electron in the excited state. Solving the Poisson equation, the eﬀective potential is
obtained as superposition of the Coulomb potential and the potential of the neighboured atoms, which leads to the
lowering of the Coulomb potential.

This lowering of the eﬀective potential has two eﬀects: On the one hand, the energy level is shifted to lower energies,
on the other hand, at a certain critical distance, the threshold of potential energy between neighboured atoms crosses
the shifted electrons energy level, and the bound state is dissolved into the continuum. This typically happens when
the distance between neighbours comes into the range of the extension of the electrons wave-function.

We considerd the radiating atom with the electron in the nth energy level, n = 3, 4, 5, in the environment of neutral
hydrogen atoms in the ground state. At position ~Ri, the contribution to the potential of the latter is obtained solving
the Poisson equation,

We assume a closed packed conﬁguration where the radiating atom is surrounded by 12 perturbing next neighbours.
The shift of the energy levels with principal quantum numbers n = 3 and 4 has been evaluated in ﬁrst order of
perturbation theory and can be given in an analytical form. Results for the shift as a function of the interatomic
distance are given in Fig. 7(a).

In Fig 7(b) we give the potential energy V (r) in the direction to a next neighbour for two diﬀerent distances,
together with the corresponding shift of the energy levels with n = 3 and n = 4. As can be seen, the bound state
disappears at a critical distance R(n)
c where the threshold energy becomes lower than the binding energy, and the
electron is no longer bound to the central ion, but escapes the eﬀective potential and moves relatively freely within
the cluster.

From the critical distance R(n)

, one can then infer the “critical” density n(n)

that has to established in the expanding
system, before the upper level n of the considered transition can exist, i.e. before the corresponding spectral line can
occur. In this way, we obtained for the second excited level, relevant for the Hα transition, a “critical” density of
n(α)
c ≃ 1.24 · 1021 cm−3. This value for nc is by a factor of two larger than the value natom = 4.5 · 1020 cm−3 obtained
from the ﬁt of the Hα line to the line shape due to van der Waals interaction, cf. Fig. 2(a).

correlations between radiator and perturber which have been neglected in the calculation of the perturbing potential.
The account for correlation and exchange eﬀects will modify the potential and the critical density. In addition, we
considered only a perturbing atom at mean distance, neglecting any ﬂuctuations. On the other hand, the spectra are
time intergrated measurements and hence the density has to be interpreted as a mean value, averaged over the whole
exposure time. Initially, i.e. when the radiation begins to take place, the density might in fact be larger than the
value inferred from the measured spectra. For Hβ, the critical density is obtained as n(β)
c ≃ 2.66 · 1020 cm−3, which
also exceeds the ﬁt parameter for the Hβ line (natom = 1.8 · 1020 cm−3) for the same reasons as given above for the
case of the Hα line (cf. Fig. 2(b)).

In conclusion, the observed Balmer spectra are not produced in the ﬁrst stage of the laser excitation of the cluster,
because the density of hydrogen in the condensed state is too high to form well-deﬁned excited atomic levels with the
corresponding principal quantum numbers. Such levels appear only during the process of expansion and may be used
as a signal to infer the state of the microplasma at the corresponding time stage.

D. Line emission scenario

As discussed in the previous Section, the observed Balmer spectra cannot be interpreted within an equilibrium
picture of the laser produced microplasma. We could not infer consistent values of plasma parameters for temperature
and density. A consistent description is only possible if the time evolution of the expanding microplasma is considered
as a non-equilibrium process.

We follow the dynamical expansion of the laser excited hydrogen droplet as given from the hydrodynamical calcu-
lation. First we consider the time evolution of the density and determine the time at which the Hα line appears, i.e.
where the inferred density n = 4.5 · 1020 cm−3 is reached. Starting with the excitation temperature T = 14 eV after
the short-pulse laser excitation, this density appears at 0.7 ns. The corresponding temperature obtained from the
hydrocode MULTI is T = 0.65 eV and is in reasonable agreement with the estimation given in Section 3.2.1. Thus,
the Hα line proﬁle reﬂects the situation of the expanding microplasma after 0.7 ns. In the case of the Hβ we observe
the following: From the van der Waals ﬁt to the data, cf. Fig. 2(b), natom = 1.8 · 1020 cm−3 was obtained, which is
reached in the hydrodynamic simulation after t ≃ 0.9 ns. The temperature is T ≃ 0.4 eV at that moment, which is
close to the value 0.5 eV obtained from comparing the integrated line intensities of Hβ and Hγ, cf. Tab. I. Hβ thus
gives us information about the state of the droplet at t ≃ 0.9 ns.

As for the empirically determined plasma parameters, the critical densities for Hα and Hβ as discussed in Sec. IV C,
have to be compared to the results of the hydrodynamic simulation. The central density of the droplet decreases to
the critical density for Hα to appear, n(α)
c = 1.24 · 1021 cm−3 after 0.45 ns. After the same time, the temperature at

13

the center of the droplet has decreased to 1.3 eV, which is in good agreement with the value 1 eV inferred from the
relative line intensities of Hα to Hβ.
The critical density for Hβ, n(β)

c = 2.66 · 1020 cm−3 is reached after 0.8 ns. The central temperature is 0.5 eV at
that moment, which coincides again very well with the value 0.5 eV as obtained from the relative line intensities of
Hβ and Hγ.

This analysis shows, that the droplet in fact undergoes a complex dynamical evolution. The experimental observa-
tions can only be understood by modelling the droplets history using hydrocodes. 14 eV as the initial temperature is
consistent with the observed temperatures and densities established at later times of the evolution. The line radiation
obviously steems from relatively late times in the evolution. What happens before line radiation appears? At the
initial conditions of natom = nliq = 4.2 · 1022 cm−3 and T = 14 eV, the ionization of the droplet can be estimated by
68%, as calculated from solving Saha’s equation, cf. Fig. 6. The plasma emission is thus dominated by continuum
radiation (free-free and free-bound transitions). However, since the detector integrates over the whole evolution of
the plasma, only a ﬂat background remains in the spectrum from this early stage of the evolution. As the ionization
goes down, bound states begin to form and line radiation occurs. However, for a given spectral line, both upper and
lower level of the corresponding transition have to be well deﬁned. To this end, the density has to go below a certain
value, in order to allow for the excited energy level to appear below the eﬀective potential in the dense medium.

Considering the time scales for the expansion of the cluster of the order 10−9 s according to the hydrodynamical
calculations, the local thermodynamic equilibrium can be assumed, and the life time of the excited states of the
order 10−11 s is short compared with the evolution of the microplasma. In a more rigorous approach, the variation of
temperature and density in space and time should be accounted for to synthesize the spectra.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We found that the investigation of Balmer spectra can be used to get a time-resolved picture of the expanding
microplasma produced after irradiating a liquid hydrogen droplet with femtosecond intense laser beams. The line
proﬁles are interesting features of optical spectra which allow for determination of the microplasmas temperature and
density over the course of its hydrodynamic expansion. We considered an energy deposition in the liquid hydrogen
droplet which is not too high so that in the expanded phase most of the electrons are found in atomic bound states.
Thus, the spectral line proﬁles are determined by van der Waals broadening. We presented a general quantumstatistical
approach to line proﬁles which allows for the uniﬁed description of charged and neutral perturbers. In particular,
density eﬀects can be included, such as dynamical screening or strong collisions.

Although the spectra are time integrated measurements, we can use the Balmer lines as signatures for the expanding
microplasma at deﬁnite values of density. To follow the time evolution of an excited droplet more directly, time resolved
spectra have to be analyzed. Possibly, this can be achieved with pump-probe experiments and/or stimulated emission
measurements.

APPENDIX A: GREEN FUNCTION APPROACH TO THE POLARIZATION FUNCTION

The general expression for the single state contribution Π1(~k, ω) to the polarization function has the form

Π1 =

Γ(0)

.

(A1)

The full single-particle propagator contains the self-energy Σ1(~p, z),

=

Σ

.

(A2)

The vertex describes the coupling to the electromagnetic ﬁeld and can also be expressed in terms of an eﬀective
interaction kernel. Both quatities have to be approximated in a consistent way. The so-called GW approximation

15

(A4)

(A5)

(A6)

gives the self-energy by the screened potential so that

ΣGW =

whereas the vertex has the form

=

Γ(0)

.

Γ(0)

The GW approximation is well studied in condensed matter physics. It describes also the bremsstrahlung an can

be further improved accounting for plasma eﬀects.

The two-particle contribution Π2(~k, ω) to the polarization function is described accordingly,

Π2(~k, ωµ) =

M (0)

.

We have the full two-particle propagator

G2(α ~P , Ωλ) =

=

1
Ωλ − Eα ~P − Σ2(α ~P , Ωλ)

,

with the two-particle self-energy Σ2(α ~P , Ωλ), and the vertex follows from an equation in analogy to Eq. (A4). Note
that one has to take into account that double counting has to be avoided so that scattering states in Π2(~k, ω) should
not interfer with contributions from Π1(~k, ω). Important are the account of bound states in Π2(~k, ω).

The higher order corrections to the full vertex M (~q) can be shown to eﬀectively reduce the two-particle self-energy

[13] by the amount iΓv. After analytic continuation ωµ → ω + i0+ to real frequencies, we obtain

Note, that the dependance on ω is neglected in the self-energy of the lower energy level [13].

Neglecting the self-energy and the eﬀective vertex in Eq. (A7), we arrive at Eq. (3).

APPENDIX B: BOUND STATE CONTRIBUTION TO THE TWO-PARTICLE SELF-ENERGY

The interaction between two atoms in state |α1i and |α2i, moving with momentum ~P1 and ~P2 respectively, and

carrying Matsubara frequencies Ωλ and Ωκ, upon exchange of momentum ~k is given by the following diagram:

Vα1,α2( ~P1, ~P2, Ωλ, Ωκ, ~k) =

with the unscreened Coulomb potential V~k = −e2/ǫ0k2Ω0. Due to the ion’s heavy mass, we neglect the transfer
momentum ~k in the intermediate propagator as well as the kinetic energy ~2P 2/2M . Replacing the Matsubara
frequencies Ωλ and Ωκ by their on-shell values, we can perform the summations over momenta in Eq. (4) and arrive
at the familiar expression Eq. (7).

APPENDIX C: CALCULATION OF THE INTERACTION STRENGTH

The expression Eq. (8) has to be evaluated. We rewrite it as

The primed sum indicates summation only over states, which assure a ﬁnite denominator.

Henceforth, we assume one atom in a low-lying excited state α1 = n1l1, n1 = 2, 3, 4, 5, and the second atom in its
ground state, α2 ≡ 0. Then, virtual excitations to highly excited states α are more probable than those to states with
energy smaller than E(0)
α1 . We can neglect the energies of those vitually excited states Eα3 and Eα4 against the sum
of energy of the ground state energy and of the lowly excited state E(0)
1). Eq. (C1) becomes

W = y1y2 + z1z2 − 2x1x2 .

The diagonal matrix element of W vanishes for atoms with no permanent electric dipole moment. Chosing the
nucleus-nucleus axis parallel to the x-axis of the coordinate system, the operator W reads

Since the expectation values of any coordinate x, y or z vanishes, e.g. hα10 |ri| α10i = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, the mixed terms
in W2 vanish. We obtain

we ﬁnally obtain Eq. (10).

Note, that for the case, that the ﬁrst atom is also in its ground state, i.e. α ≡ 0, C6(00) = 12 is obtained.
The diﬀerence to the London-Eisenschitz result 12.94 is due to the neglectance of virtual bound-free and free-free
transitions in the calculation presented above. For excited states, which are considered in this work, this contribution
becomes negligible.

APPENDIX D: EVALUATION OF THE VAN DER WAALS PROFILE

We start with the general form of expression (7), i.e. the intensity distribution of a given spectral line, due to
interaction between the radiator, which is in state | i i before the transition and in state | f i after the transition and
the perturber i, i = 1 . . . N in state |nii . It is obtained by performing an averaging procedure over the distribution
of the N perturbing atoms,

Here, PN (~r1, . . . ~rN ) is the probability density for having atom 1 in the volume element d3~r1 at ~r1, atom 2 in the

A model is introduced to study the dynamics of transverse perturbations at the surface of
overdense plasmas irradiated by intense laser pulses at normal incidence. We ﬁnd that the one-
dimensional “moving mirror” oscillation at the frequency 2ω, with ω the laser frequency, can be
unstable due to the parametric excitation of transverse surface waves at frequency ω and wave-
length ≤ λ = 2πc/ω. The analytical results are in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations
[A. Macchi et al., physics/0105019, submitted to Phys. Rev. Lett. for publication]. For moderately
overdense plasmas, this parametric surface instability may drive a rippling of the critical surface over
a few laser cycles, much faster than the typical time scales of ion motion. This rippling is expected
to have a detrimental eﬀect in the generation of high laser harmonics from laser interaction with
solid targets by disrupting the planarity of the moving mirror.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of sub-picosecond, high-intensity laser
pulses with solid targets is of great relevance for a num-
ber of applications, such as bright pulsed sources of en-
ergetic particles and XUV radiation, production of dense
coupled plasmas, testing of the Fast Ignitor concept in
Inertial Conﬁnement Fusion.
In particular, generation
of high laser harmonics in the reﬂected light has been
studied as a promising way to develop an ultrashort, co-
herent source of soft X-rays. High harmonics (HH) gen-
eration is qualitatively explained by the concept of the
plasma “moving mirror” [1]. The basic idea is as follows:
a laser pulse of frequency ω is reﬂected at the “critical”
surface of the laser-produced plasma where the electron
density ne = nc cos θ, being θ the incidence angle and
nc = meω2/4πe2; on the other hand, the intense elec-
tric and magnetic forces of the laser pulse drive oscilla-
tions of the critical surface at the frequencies ω and/or
2ω, depending on the incidence angle and the pulse po-
larization;
imposing boundary conditions for the inci-
dent and reﬂected waves at the oscillating critical surface
leads to the appearance of high harmonics. The mov-
ing mirror model also gives selection rules for harmonic
order and polarization which are in agreement with ex-
periments, and shows that moderately overdense plasmas
(ne/nc < 10) are needed to achieve large oscillations of
the critical surface and, consequently, good conversion
eﬃciency into HHs, in agreement with the results of self-
consistent, one-dimensional (1D) simulations [2, 3].
In
experiments this may be achieved by appropriate tuning
of pulse duration or by controlled prepulses.

There is great interest in exploring HH generation
in the regime of relativistic irradiances a > 1, where
a = 0.85(Iλ2/1018 W cm−2µm2)1/2 is the ratio between
the oscillation momentum of electrons and mec, and I,

∗Electronic address: macchi@df.unipi.it

λ = 2πc/ω are the laser intensity and wavelength, respec-
tively. In fact, in this regime the conversion eﬃciency is
expected to rise also because of retardation eﬀects in the
moving mirror driven at relativistic velocities [1, 4, 5].
However, experiments have shown that when approach-
ing such intensities the collimation of HHs in the direc-
tion of specular reﬂection is lost because of the generation
of density “ripples” at the critical surface [6, 7, 8]. This
disruption of the “moving mirror” planarity may pose an
ultimate limit on the eﬃciency of HH generation for pro-
ducing coherent XUV radiation. It has been suggested
that the generation of ripples may be due to Rayleigh-
Taylor-like hydrodynamic instabilities, since the strong
radiation pressure drives large accelerations of the critical
surface [9]. However, already in early simulation works
where ripple generation was observed [10] it is pointed
out that such structures are originated by the motion of
electrons on a time scale faster than that of ions.

−

In recent two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simula-
tions [11], oscillating ripples were observed for moder-
ately overdense plasmas (ne/nc = 3
5), immobile ions,
at irradiances near ao = 1, for normal laser incidence and
s-polarization, such that the moving mirror oscillation is
planar and electrostatic and has frequency 2ω. Peculiar
features of the 2D ripples is that their oscillation fre-
quency is ω and their wavelength is less than λ = 2πc/ω.
In addition, this surface oscillation appears to be “stand-
ing”, i.e. not propagating along the surface. These fea-
tures suggest that the basic mechanism leading to the
generation of ripples is a parametric “decay” of the 1D,
electrostatic oscillation with frequency 2ω and transverse
wavevector k = 0 in two surface modes with frequencies
ω1, ω2 and wavevectors k1, k2, respectively. In fact, the
“matching conditions” for this process, i.e. the conser-
vation law for the sum of frequencies and wavevectors,
immediately give k1 =
k2 and ω1 = ω2 = ω. The two
overlapping surface modes thus form a standing oscilla-
tion with frequency ω and wavevector k = k1 =
k2.
Note that this reasoning is simply based on the existence
of transverse surface modes with given dispersion rela-

−

−

tion. Using such a relation, the mode frequency ω gives
the wavevector k and the wavelength of the surface os-
cillation λs = 2π/k.

In this paper, we present an analytical model which
shows that electromagnetic surface waves (ESWs) [12]
can be parametrically stimulated by the 1D electrostatic
motion of the plasma surface and grow over a few laser
cycles for moderately overdense plasmas. The aim of this
paper is to give a proof of principle of this parametric
surface instability (PSI) and to support the interpreta-
tion of the numerical simulations. Thus, for the sake
of simplicity, we take the same 2D geometry of the nu-
merical simulations [11], i.e. normal laser incidence and
s-polarization, and use cold ﬂuid, non-relativistic equa-
tions. A brief sketch of the model has been already given
in [11], where simulation results are also shown. Rela-
tivistic and kinetic eﬀects, oblique incidence, damping of
surface waves and fully nonlinear evolution of the PSI are
left for future investigations.

II. FLUID MODEL

We consider an intense, linearly polarized wave (repre-
senting the laser pulses) that impinges on an overdense
plasma. Ions are immobile and have a step-like density
proﬁle no = niθ(x) where θ(x) is the Heaviside step func-
tion. The laser wave has frequency ω and is polarized
along z. It can be represented by a single component of
the vector potential, Az = Az(x, t). Cold plasma ﬂuid
equations will be used for the electrons.

×

Electrons perform their quiver motion in the z direc-
B force term is in the x direction and
tion. Thus, the v
has a secular term (0ω) and an oscillating term (2ω).
The secular term corresponds to radiation pressure and
creates a surface polarization of the plasma. The 2ω
term drives a longitudinal, electrostatic oscillation which,
as discussed below, determines the “moving mirror” mo-
tion. After solving the equations for the 1D quiver and
longitudinal motions, we will study 2D transverse per-
turbations, considering the quiver motion and the laser
wave as imperturbed. Within this assumption, the lon-
gitudinal laser force appears as an external force in the
equations for the longitudinal, electrostatic motion. As
is usual, we call this force the ponderomotive force. In
our approach we adopt the following expansion
u = u(0)(x) + ǫu(2ω)(x, t) + ǫ2u(ω)

(1)

K (x, y, t) ,

where ǫ is a small expansion parameter and u stands for
either the electron density or velocity or for the EM ﬁelds
in the (x, y) plane. In this expansion, the ponderomotive
force is supposed to be of order ǫ.

The 1D and 2D oscillating ﬁelds will be written in the

form

u(2ω)(x, t) =

−2iωt + c.c. ,

u(ω)

Within the limits of validity of our expansion procedure
in (1), the transverse 2D waves will be found to be “stan-
dard” electron surface waves [12]. As will be shown in
the following, coupling between 1D and 2D ﬁelds occurs
only into the overdense plasma (x > 0). Thus, since
the ponderomotive force is quadratic in the laser ﬁeld,
ǫ1/2, where as is
the expansion (1) also imposes as ∼
the (dimensionless) laser amplitude at the surface of the
plasma:

We therefore expect our expansion procedure to be valid

even at relativistic ﬁelds amplitudes ai ∼

where ls = c/(ω2
ω2)1/2 is the screening length and As
is the amplitude of the vector potential at the surface x =
0. Imposing boundary conditions for the incident and re-
s/c2)1/2,
ﬂected waves one ﬁnds As = 2Ai(ωls/c)/(1+ω2l2
where Ai is the amplitude of the incident ﬁeld.

which shows the well-known resonance at ne = 4nc due
to excitation of plasmons with frequency ωp = 2ω by the
ponderomotive force.

The fact that ∆N (x>0)
> 0 during most of the oscillation
implies that, due to compression from the ponderomotive
force, electrons leave behind a charge depletion layer of
thickness ζ = ∆N (x>0)
/ni. We note that ζ is of order
ǫ, thus to lowest order it is correct to treat the charge
depletion layer as a surface layer. We also note that, since
< 1, there is always a phase in which electrons are
D
|
pulled into vacuum forming a cloud of negative charge.
This is observed in simulations [11].

|

e

Heuristically, the oscillating behavior of ζ describes the
“moving mirror” motion: due to charge depletion the
laser is reﬂected at x = ζ rather than exactly at x = 0.
Thus, in our model high harmonic ﬁelds appear at order
ǫ2. Harmonic oscillations at frequency higher than 2ω
are not of interest in the following, since it is the leading
motion at 2ω that excites the surface modes parametri-
cally.

The phase interval during which the electrons are
4, i.e.

dragged into vacuum is very short for ne/nc ≫

3

≃

D
1. For lower densities, however, this phase is impor-
tant in the interaction process. The motion in vacuum is
strongly anharmonic and more complex to be solved ana-
litically than the motion inside the plasma. Fortunately,
it will be found below that the surface modes gain energy
during the phase of electron motion inside the plasma
only, so that the expressions of ﬁelds for x < 0 are not
needed. However, we have to assume that the density
cloud formed in front of the target surface is rareﬁed
enough that the laser penetration into the plasma is not
signiﬁcantly aﬀected.

The validity limits of the expansion (1) can be checked
using eqs.(14-15-16). The expansion parameter can be
written as

ǫ =

Here and in the following we eventually set for conve-

nience α = ne/nc = ω2

such that ne/nc ≫
tic irradiances ao > 1 because the laser ﬁeld inside the
plasma is much smaller than in vacuum. The expansion
ωp)
tends to become invalid near the resonance (2ω
because the ﬁelds become very large.

IV. LINEAR SURFACE WAVES

We now search for solutions of the Maxwell-Euler sys-
tem in the form given by eq.(3), and in a 2D geometry
where the magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the (x, y)
plane. Thus, Maxwell’s equations are written as

which are of order ǫ2, but are non resonant

with the 2D oscillations at frequency ω and represent a
source term for higher harmonic, 1D (k = 0) oscillations.
We thus ﬁnd that to this order all coupling between 1D
and 2D modes may be neglected. Therefore, to order ǫ2
the equation of motion for the 2D modes gives

imeω ˜v(ω) =

For no = niθ(x), equations (23-24-25) have a solution
in the form of electron surface waves (ESWs). ESWs
are “H” waves which can propagate along a discontinuity
in the dielectric function, with the latter changing sign
across the boundary [12]. In our case we have

V. THE PARAMETRIC SURFACE
INSTABILITY

To order ǫ3, the 2D ESWs are coupled to the 1D mo-
tion.
In this section we show that, at the parametric
resonance, the coupling of the 1D ﬁelds with two over-
lapping ESWs leads to a growth of the surface energy of
ESWs, i.e. the surface perturbations are unstable.

The 2D perturbations at the frequency ω are the su-

perposition of two SWs:

v(ω)(x, y, t) =

˜v+k(x)e+iky−iωt+ǫνt/2

+˜v−k(x)e−iky−iωt+ǫνt/2 + c.c.

Here k = k(ω) is given by (33) and ˜v±k(x) =
x)eq−x + θ(x)e−q+ x]. Analogous expressions are
˜v+k [θ(
written for the EM ﬁelds of the SWs E(ω) and B(ω)
z ˆz(ω).
The frequency ν gives the temporal variation of the
square modulus of the envelopes on the “slow” time scale,
e.g ∂t|
Now we write the Euler equation for v(ω) =
v(ω)(x, y, t), keeping only terms up to order ǫ3 and disre-
garding terms that are non-resonant with the oscillation.
We thus obtain

corresponds to take the ESW ﬂuid velocity v(ω) = 0 for
x < 0). Also note that due to the temporal and spatial
average only “resonant” terms survive. Inserting eq.(43)

which corresponds to a standing wave having a temporal

written in eq.(10). Using eq.(52) we ﬁnd that any of the

We used eq.(14) and the fact that F 0 is real and positive.
Thus, the most unstable mode has a phase shift φ =
π/4 for which the growth rate is positive and has a
−
maximum. One also ﬁnds that the phase shift is such
that, at a given position in y, the temporal maxima of
V (2ω)
and v(ω) overlap once for laser cycle. This behavior
x
is observed in simulations [11]. The angle ∆φ gives the
location of the maxima of the standing wave on the y
axis. This location depends on the arbitrary choice of
the temporal phase of the ﬁelds. In our case this choice
has been made in eq.(10).

VI. DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, the PSI investigated in the present
paper has not been discussed so far in the literature. We
note that in the moving mirror motion driven by intense
pulses a superposition of ω and 2ω motions occurs only
for oblique incidence and p-polarization, because in such
a case both the electric and magnetic forces (at ω and 2ω,
respectively) have components normal to the surface [4].
Surface inhomogeneities induced by the magnetic force of
the laser pulse have been studied recently[14]. However,
they occur for oblique incidence only and have frequency
2ω.

As discussed above, our non-relativistic, quasi-linear
model tends to be valid at high laser intensities for large
values of ne/nc. In this case, however, the PSI growth
rate (58) rapidly drops as (ne/nc)−3. Thus, for near
solid-density plasmas (ne/nc > 10) the PSI is likely to
play a negligible role. At least, one has to consider the
competition with damping eﬀects on the ESWs (not in-
cluded so far in our model) and the motion of the plasma
ions.

On the other hand, the PSI is expected to be rele-
vant when the short laser pulse actually interacts with a
plasma “shelf” at moderate densities ne/nc < 10. This is
precisely the regime of interest for HH generation. Note
that the PSI growth rate is proportional to the abso-
lute value of the “moving mirror” velocity, so that PSI
tends to be faster exactly for the conditions of “optimal”
conversion eﬃciency, in particular near the ne = 4nc res-
onance [3]. However, one must notice that our expansion

≃
≃

procedure loses validity near resonance. The growth rate
2nc. However, in this limit the
diverges also when ne →
value of k tends to inﬁnity, i.e. the wavelength becomes
very small. Thus one expects this second resonance to be
damped by thermal eﬀects, which we neglected so far. To
show the dramatic dependence of ν on density, we note
i for α = 5
i for α = 10, ν

In the nonlinear growth stage, the PSI may lead to the
generation of strong density perturbations at the critical
surface and be responsible for the surface rippling ob-
served in experiments. It is important that the PSI may
grow on a time scale of a few laser cycles, much faster
than the typical time scales of the ion motion. The obser-
vation that surface rippling appears even for a pulse dura-
tion as short as 35 fs for λ = 0.8µm [7] is a strong indica-
tion in favor of a mechanism faster than Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities. The actual values of the electron density in
the shelf and of the density gradient may play a crucial
role, since the PSI instability also requires ne/nc > 2
to allow matching conditions for the parametric decay of
the 1D mode into two ESWs. The strong dependence of
the HH conversion eﬃciency on the density scalelength at
ne|@ne=nc has been shown
the critical surface Lc = nc/
experimentally [15].
The PSI explains reasonably well the spatial scales of
the transverse structures oscillating at ω observed in 2D
PIC simulations [11].
In addition, the observed phase
shift between the ω and 2ω oscillations agrees with the
model. For a simulation with ao = 0.85, ne/nc = 3, i.e.
parameters for which the analytical model is marginally
0.75λ) of den-
valid, the observed wavelength (λs ≃
sity ripples agrees well with the dispersion relation of
0.71λ). For a simulation with ao = 1.7,
ESWs (λs ≃
ne/nc = 5, where the quiver motion is relativistic and our
assumptions are strongly violated, the observed wave-
0.87λ)
length (λs ≃
on the basis of the non-relativistic, quasi-linear model.
As discussed in [11] this suggests a decrease of the ef-
fective plasma frequency due to the relativistic “mass
increase” induced by the quiver motion. This indica-
tion is important since a decrease of the eﬀective plasma
frequency would also produce a strong increase of the
growth rate, and experiments indicate that the inten-
sity at which strong surface rippling appears is close to

0.5λ) is shorter than expected (λs ≃

7

the relativistic threshold ao = 1. Thus one may expect
that the PSI becomes more important in the relativistic
regime of laser-plasma interaction. This conjecture will
be investigated in future work. In addition we note that
the simulations in [11] also show a correlation between
the onset of PSI and the generation of fast electron jets,
which happens mainly near maxima of the standing sur-
face oscillation.

Finally, we notice that the PSI represents a nonlin-
ear mechanism for the generation of surface waves by
laser which is diﬀerent from the several schemes that
have been investigated previously either in the context of
laser-produced plasmas [16] or of metal and semiconduc-
tor surfaces [17]. In these studies, one ﬁnds that possible
conditions for the excitation of surface waves are oblique
incidence, p-polarization, microstructuring of the target
surface, special preformed plasma proﬁles, presence of an
external magnetic ﬁeld, temperature discontinuities, or a
combination of some of those conditions. To our knowl-
edge, the PSI is the ﬁrst mechanism capable of excit-
ing surface waves by s-polarized, normally incident laser
pulses in a 2D geometry.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a two-dimensional, non-relativistic,
cold ﬂuid model for the growth of electromagnetic sur-
face perturbations in overdense plasmas irradiated by
normally incident, s-polarized laser pulses. The physi-
cal mechanism is the parametric excitation of a couple of
counterpropagating electron surface waves by the laser-
driven, one-dimensional electrostatic oscillation at twice
the laser frequency. Matching conditions for this para-
metric process require that the frequency of the surface
waves equals the laser frequency, while their (transverse)
wavelength is shorter than the laser wavelength. The
model explains reasonably well the basic features (fre-
quency, wavelength, phase, growth rate) observed in nu-
merical simulations reported in [11], even when the sim-
ulations are performed in a regime beyond the assump-
tions of the analytical model. This parametric surface
instability may explain the rippling of the critical surface
observed in experiments on high harmonic generation.

Abstract

The space-uniform amplitude envelope of the Ion Temperature Gra-
dient driven turbulence is unstable to small perturbations and evolves to
nonuniform, soliton-like modulated proﬁles. The induced poloidal asym-
metry of the transport ﬂuxes can generate spontaneous poloidal spin-up
of the tokamak plasma.

1 Introduction

The ion temperature gradient turbulence, considered a major source of anoma-
lous transport in the tokamak plasma, is characterized by the coexistence of
irregular patterns (randomly ﬂuctuating ﬁeld) and intermittent robust cuasi-
coherent structures. In closely related ﬂuid models (for exemple, in the physics
of atmosphere) modulational instabilities are known to produce solitary struc-
tures on the envelope of the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld. In the case of the tokamak, this
can be particularly important since a poloidally nonuniform amplitude of the
turbulence generates nonuniform transport rates. For a suﬃciently high nonuni-
formity the torque arising via the mechanism initially mentioned by Stringer [1]
may overcame the rotation damping due to the poloidal magnetic pumping. In
this work we show that this can indeed be the case by proving that the uni-
form poloidal envelope of the ITG turbulence is an unstable state. It appears
that the ITG turbulence has intrinsic resources to generate poloidal rotation
via a combination of mechanisms which is not directly related to the Reynolds
stress, inverse cascade, direct-ion loss, or other classical sources of rotation. We

2

provide an essentially mathematical explanation of the instability of the solu-
tion consisting of poloidally uniform envelope of the turbulence. Based on the
geometrico-algebraic method of solving integrable nonlinear diﬀerential equa-
tions on periodic domains we invoke an existing result, that any perturbation
removes the degeneracies due to coincident eigenvalues in the main spectrum of
the Lax operator, thus changing the topology of the hyperelliptic Riemann sur-
face that provides the solution. The perturbed solution separates exponentially
(in function space) from the initial one (uniform envelope) and this yields an
exponential growth of the poloidal nonuniformity. The magnitude of the torque
may be comparable to the poloidal magnetic damping.

There are many works in plasma physics related to the soliton dynamics [2],
[3], [4], [5], [7], etc. In a recent paper the focusing solution has been used to study
the formation of coherent motion or intermittent patterns (streamers) [2]. Our
work is basically a mathematical approach, using well developed technics related
to the Inverse Scattering Transform method for periodic domains. However,
more physical analysis may become possible combining the knowledge of the
spectral properties of the ion turbulence with the nonlinear stability properties.
This work consists of several parts that may appear as developing separately:
the derivation of the ion equation (barotropic equation), the multiple space-
time scales analysis, the solution of the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation and
the stability of the solution, the torque arising from the Stringer mechanism
and the possibility of the rotation. For being self-contained the paper also
includes a review of the multiple space-time analysis (from the atmospheric
physics applications) and of the geometric-algebraic method of integration of
the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation. Even if these parts could be found in basic
works (see the references) they are included both for clarity and for their extreme
importance for further applications related to our problem or independent of
this.

2 The slab model of the ion mode instability

We consider cylindrical geometry with circular magnetic surfaces. Locally the
model can be reduced to a slab geometry with (x, y) cartezian coordinates re-
placing respectively the radius and poloidal angle coordinates (r, θ). At equilib-
rium the plasma parameters are constant on the magnetic surfaces. The eﬀects
of the toroidicity and of the particle drifts are not included instead the nonlin-
earity related to the ion polarization drift is fully retained. The plasma model
consists of the continuity equations and the equations of motion for electrons
and ions:

Ri =

Jk/σk , which are im-
where α = e, i. The friction forces Re =
portant for the parallel electron momentum balance, vanish for inﬁnite plasma
conductivity, which we will assume. The collisional viscosity πe,i will be ne-
glected as well. However we will need to include it later when we will consider
the balance of the forces contributing to the poloidal rotation. The electron and
ion temperatures are considered constant along the magnetic lines
∇kTe,i = 0.
The equilibrium quantities are perturbed by the wave potential φ: n = n0 +
n.
A sheared poloidal plasma rotation is included, and we later will make explicit
the corresponding part in the potential, φ0.

e
The momentum conservation equations are used to determine the perpendic-
ular velocities of the electrons and ions. The parallel momentum conservation
equation for electrons, in the absence of dissipation or drifts gives the adiabatic
distribution of the density ﬂuctuation. The velocities are introduced in the con-
tinuity equations to ﬁnd the dynamical equations for the density and electric
potential.

From the equations of motion for the ions the velocities are obtained in the

form:

vi = v⊥i = vdia,i + vE + vpol,i

2.1 The mode evolution in a ﬁxed plasma rotation proﬁle

The coeﬃcients are

For an order of magnitude, ε is the ratio of the diamagnetic electron velocity
to the rotation velocity U0 multiplied by the ratio of the density gradient length
to the length of the spatial domain. This quantity, ε is in general smaller than
unity.

The quantity β′ is the ratio of the ion cyclotron frequency to the inverse
of the time required to cross the spatial domain with the typical ﬂow velocity.
Since the later (U0/L) involves macroscopic quantities this ratio can be large.
It is multiplied by the ratio of the spatial length to the density gradient length
(these quantities can be comparable and the ratio not too diﬀerent of unity).
We change the notations eliminating the primes. The equation becomes

leads to the barotropic
The quasigeostrophic barotropic atmospheric model
equation (see Horton [7] where the quasigeostrophic approximation is explained
in relation with the Ertel’s theorem). This equation has been studied in the
atmosphere science by means of the multiple space and time scales method. Our
aim is similar, i.e. to obtain an equation for the envelope of the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld
φ in order to study the possible poloidally nonuniform proﬁles of the turbulence
averaged amplitude. The connection between the original equation and the ﬁnal
slow-time and large-spatial scales equations is not simple : much numerical work
is required in order to connect the input physical parameters of the plasma
with the formal coeﬃcients in the ﬁnal equations. The detailed analytical work
is presented in Ref([8]) and the necessary formulas are reproduced here for
convenience. To simplify the expressions the following notation is introduced

In this formula, (0, L) are the limits of the spatial domain in the minor radius
direction where the ﬂow U (x)
= 0 ; cn = ωn/kn are the phase velocities. To
ﬁnd the solutions of this equation we have to use numerical methods. This is
a Schrodinger-type equation where the potential depends on the energy, (since
the phase velocity cn depends on the wavenumber kn). We must use numerical
methods suitable for Sturm-Liouville equations and in general the solution exists
for only particular values of the parameters. We choose to ﬁx the frequencies ωn
and consider kn as the parameter to be determined. The problem is complicated
by the possible occurence of singularities in the potential due to resonances
between the phase velocity and the ﬁxed zonal ﬂow. We will avoid any resonance
since the physical content of the processes consisting of the direct energy transfer
between the ﬂuctuations and the ﬂow represents a diﬀerent physical problem
and requires separate consideration. In the present work we examine the eﬀect of
the turbulence on the poloidal rotation as being due to the nonuniform diﬀusion
rates and Stringer mechanism.

The parameters in the Eqs.(22) are β, ε and the sheared ﬂow velocity U (x).
We take for U (x) a symmetric Gaussian-like proﬁle shifted in amplitude and
retain its maximum, half-width and asymptotic value (i.e. at x = 0 or L) as
parameters. The two frequencies have ﬁxed values during the eigenvalue search
but they must be considered free parameters as well. This builds up a large
space of parameters which should be sampled. For some point in this space the
eigenvalue problems Eqs.(22) are solved and the phase velocities compared with
the proﬁle of U (x). The presence of resonances renders the set of parameters
useless. Since (as will result from the formuals below) there are also other
possible resonances, the determination of a useful solution (k1, k2) is diﬃcult
and requires many trials.

The numerical methods that have been used in solving Eqs.(22) belong to two
classes: boundary value integration methods and respectively shooting meth-
ods. When the sign of the “potential” in the equation is negative everywhere on

14

(0, L) , which occurs for short wavelengths and smooth ﬂuid velocity proﬁle the
boundary conditions cannot be fulﬁlled except for asymtotically, i.e. assuming
arbitrary small nonzero values at these limits, since the solution decays expo-
nentially. However most of the boundary value integrators we have tried gave
amplitudes of magnitudes comparable to the boundary value, which essentially
are homotopic to the trivial vanishing solution (the equation is homogeneous)
and render useless this approach. We have to use a shooting method accepting
the diﬃculty that the initial value of the parameter to be determined (eigen-
value) must be placed not far from the ﬁnal value. We have used the specialized
package SLEIGN2 interactively. For the investigation of ranges of parameters
most of the calculations have been performed using the routine D02KEF of
NAG. For identical conditions the two numerical codes gave the same results
within the accepted tolerance.

Using the routine D02KEF we divide the integration range (0, L) into four
intervals corresponding roughly to a diﬀerent behaviour of the potential. This
should simplify the task of integrator. A single matching point is assumed,
usually at the centre. The tolerence is 10−8 which however does not exclude
fake convergence in case of an initialisation of the eigenvalue very far from the
true solution..

We notice from Eqs.(22) that the potential can easily be dominated by high
shear U ′′ especially for smaller wavenumbers kn. Actually we are more interested
to investigate regimes where only mild eﬀects of the seed sheared rotation arise
during the process of self-modulation since, as explained before, the possible
evolution to the nonuniformity in the poloidal direction will be the source of the
torque on the plasma. Avoiding regimes of U ′′-dominated potentials we assume
104 (m/s)
low shear and take the Gaussian proﬁle with Umax −
represented in Figure (1). The following set of physical parameters has been
used: minor radius a = 1 m, magnetic ﬁeld BT = 3.5 T , electron temperature
Te = 1 KeV , ion temperature Ti = 1 KeV , density n = 1020 m−3, Ln = 10 m.
β = 33.526 and ε =

and k2 = 3.2029. The potentials in the Schrodinger-like equations and the

Numerical experience shows that the dispersion constants are sensitive to
the precision of the integration scheme. We use for D02KEF the value for
tolerence 10−8.

The system of coupled Cubic Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations has been inte-
grated numerically in relation with many applications [10], [11]. One important
conclusion is that, in the case of a single equation, the sign of the product of
the dispersion and of the nonlinearity parameters establishes the possibility of
a soliton formation.

3.2 Numerical search for classes of admissible envelope

solutions

In principle an interactive search for eigenvalues (either with SLEIGN or D02KEF)
is able to obtain the eigenvalues k1, k2 eventually after series of less-inspired
initializations. However in many situations resonances occur and the sources
and/or the potentials in the diﬀerential equations for the functions Wn, fn be-
come discontinuous. Since these eigenvalues cannot be used we have to devise
an automatic search over the space of parameters with checks of continuity of
the functions and automatic discarding of wrong results. This is accomplished
by the routine P01ABF of NAG.

The search reveals that the short and respectively long radial wavelength
part of the ion wave spectrum have diﬀerent behavior under the modulation
instability. The most aﬀected is the long wavelength part (small kx) with ω
of the order of the ion-diamagnetic frequency. This corresponds to the domi-
nant part of the ion spectrum, because, as can be seen in numerous numerical
simulations, the dominant structures are elongated in the radial direction, with
various degrees of tilting compared to the radius. It is also important to note
that ﬁnding the eigenvalues in the scan of the parameter space weas possible in
the condition that the eigenfunctions ϕ1,2 (x) have low number of oscillations in
the radial direction (one or two). Again this corresponds to the important part
of the ITG turbulence spectrum.

The variation of the parameters of the system of NSE with the physical
parameters of the problem can be studied by the automatic search of eigenvalues,
as described before. Below are plotted four graphs showing this dependence.

4 Exact solutions of the Nonlinear Schrodinger
Equation and the nonlinear stability problem

4.1 Introduction

The Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation can be solved exactly on an inﬁnite spatial
domain using the Inverse Scattering Transform. The ﬁrst step is to represent the
nonlinear equation as a condition of compatibility of two linear equations. This
is achieved by ﬁnding a pair of linear operators (Lax operators) and noticing
that for the ﬁrst of them the eigenfunction problem is a Schrodinger equation

leading to a quantum scattering problem. The unknown function of the NSE is
the potential of the Schrodinger equation. Using the initial condition of the NSE
the scattering data are determined at t = 0. The scattering data have simple
time dependence and so they can be evloved in time to the desired moment. Re-
turning from this new set of scattering data (to the potential that has produced
it) is achieved by solving an integral equation (Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko) and
provides the solution of the NSE. In general this solution consists of solitons and
“radiation”.

The Inverse Scattering Transform on periodic domain [14], [13], [16] is a more
powerful procedure since it reveals and takes advantage of the deep geometric
and topological nature of the problem. The admissible solutions of the Lax
eigenvalue problem can now only be periodic functions. Since after one period
the change of any solution can only be linear (via the monodromy matrix)
the periodic or antiperiodic functions must be found as eigenfunctions of this
monodromy operator (matrix), under the constrain that the eigenvalues are
complex of unit absolute value. This singles out a set of complex values of
the spectral parameter λ (the formal eigenvalue in the Lax equation), the main
spectrum. From this set, the particular values that make the two eigenfunctions
to coincide are called non-degenerate. Here the squared Wronskian (which is
a space and time invariant) has zeros on the complex λ plane. Then the non-
degenerate λ’s are singular points for the Wronskian. Removing the square-root
indeterminancy one has to connect pairs of non-degenerate eigenvalues by cuts
in the λ plane. The Wronskian becomes a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. The
evolution of the unknown NSE solutions (called hyperelliptic functions µj (x, t))
on this surface is as complicated as the original NSE equation. However, via
the Abel map the Riemann surface is mapped onto a torus and on this torus the
motion magically becomes linear. After obtaining the space-time dependence
on the torus we need to come back to the original framework. This is called the
Jacobi inversion and can be done exactly in terms of Riemann theta functions,
giving at the end the exact solution of the NSE.

Not only the geometric approach is more clear but it also allows a treatment
of the stability problem for the solutions of the NSE since it allows to trace the
changes of the main spectrum after a perturbation of the initial condition. The
following subsections provide a more detailed discussion of the IST of a periodic
domain. The next section will discuss the stability. This information is available
from the abundant literature on the IST and is only mentioned here in order
to understand the mechanism governing the stability of the envelope of the ion
wave turbulence. For this reason we will focus on the determination of the main
spectrum and its role in the construction of the solution. The eﬀective steps to
be undertaken to obtain the solution will only be brieﬂy described. We strongly
recommend the lecture of Ref.([13]) on which this presentation is based.

4.2 The Lax operators and the main spectrum

The IST method starts by introducing a pair of linear operators, called the Lax
pair (see [13]) which allow to express the nonlinear equation as a compatibil-

30

ity condition for a system of two linear equations. For the cubic Schr¨odinger
equation

The action of the operators on a two-component (column) wave function φ =

φ1
φ2 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

is given by the equations

Lφ = λφ

∂φ
∂t

= Aφ

and the condition of compatibility of these two equations φxt = φtx is precisely
the cubic Nonlinear Schr¨odinger Equation.

4.3 Solving the eigenvalue equation for the operator L

As in the “inﬁnite-domain” IST, we have to solve the eigenvalue equation
Eq.(35) using the initial condition for the function u (x, t), u (x, 0). How-
ever, for the particular case of periodic solutions of the NSE, we must have
u (x + d, 0) = u (x, 0) where d is the length of the spatial period (i.e. actually L
in the previous notation; however we use d in this and the next section, keeping
L for the Lax operator). Fixing an arbitrary base point x = x0 one considers
the two independent solutions of the equation (35) which take the following
“initial” values at x = x0:

φ (x0) =

and

φ (x0) =

1

The matrix Φ (x, x0; λ) of solutions is given by

φ2 (x, x0; λ)

≡  

i.e. this solution satisﬁes the equation

LΦ = λΦ and Φ (x0, x0; λ) =

is the determinant of the matrix

of fundamental solutions

Using the initial condition for Φ one can solve the equation (39) and obtain
Φ (x, x0; λ); in particular we can obtain it at x0 + d, i.e. after a period :

Φ (x0 + d, x0; λ) =

φ1 (x0 + d, x0; λ)
φ2 (x0 + d, x0; λ)

 

This is called the monodromy matrix and is noted

The monodromy matrix is the matrix of the fundamental solutions calculated
for one spatial period. In general the monodromy matrix is the element of the
monodromy group associated to a loop and to its homotopy class, for a marked
point on a manifold (here the circle S1
[0, d). The linear monodromy group
acts by replacing the elements of the vector column by linear combinations
of the initial ones. For changes of the marked point x0 the matrix has two
invariants : the trace and the determinant:

≡

[T r M ] (x0; λ) = [T r M ] (λ)

∆ (λ)

≡

det M = 1

The function ∆ (λ) is called the discriminant and is independent of x0.

Looking for Bloch (Floquet) solutions The values the discriminant ∆ (λ)
takes on the complex λ-plane control the monodromy and by consequence select
the values of λ for which admissible eigenfunction of the Lax problem exist.
In other words ∆ governs the spectral properties of the operator L. To ﬁnd
under what conditions periodic solutions are possible, we construct the Bloch
(or Floquet) solutions of the equation Lφ = λφ. The Bloch function has the
property

ψ (x + d; λ) = eip(λ)ψ (x; λ)

(42)

where p (λ) is the Floquet exponent. Like any other solution of the Lax
eigenproblem ψ can be expressed as a linear combination of the two fundamental
solutions φ and

φ

e

ψ (x; λ) = Aφ (x; λ) + B

φ (x; λ)

For the particular point x0 we have, taking into account the “initial” conditions
(37)

ψ (x0; λ) = Aφ (x0; λ) + B

φ (x0; λ) =

A
B

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

After one period d the function ψ is linearly modiﬁed by the monodromy matrix
and, according to Eq.(42) is multiplied by a complex number of unit absolute
value. We write m (λ) for this number and look for those λ’s where this is
complex of modulus one. The regions of the λ plane where m (λ) has modulus
diﬀerent of one correspond to unstable functions ψ. We write

e

ψ (x0 + d; λ) = m (λ) ψ (x0; λ)

= m (λ)

The Bloch functions are invariant directions for the monodromy operator M
acting in the base formed by the fundamental solutions of the Lax eigenproblem.
The monodromy operator preserves these directions and multiplies the Bloch
vector with m (λ) = exp (ip (λ)).

In general ∆ (λ) is an analytic function on the plane of the complex vari-
able λ. The equation Im [∆ (λ)] = 0 is a single relation with two unknowns,
(Re λ, Im λ) and calculating one of them leaves the dependence on the other as
a free parameter. This gives a curve in the plane and the real-λ axis is such a
curve: for Im λ = 0 we have Im ∆ (λ) = 0.

(cid:1)

We look at the variation of ∆ (λ) on the complex plane to ﬁnd the eﬀect on

m± (λ).

•

Where the Floquet multiplier is a complex number of magnitude unity,
the functions are only eﬀected by a phase factor after one period. The
Bloch functions (eigenfunctions of L) are stable under translations with
d. The real λ axis is a region of stability. The region where ∆ is real and

is the band of stability, the modulus of m being 1.

•

When λ is such that the discriminant (∆ (λ)
T r (M ) ) is equal to 4,
1, and the Bloch
the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix, m (λ), are
functions are periodic or antiperiodic. This is the Main Spectrum in λ
and is noted
. The main spectrum consists of a set of discrete values
λj.

Consider the case where ∆ (λ) is complex. For all values of the parameter λ
on the complex plane, [with the exception of the Main Spectrum where ∆ (λ) =
2 ], the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix are distinct which means that
±
the eigenfunctions Bloch are distinct and Independent (The Wronskian is
diﬀerent of zero).

ψ+ (x + d) = m+ψ+ (x)
ψ− (x + d) = m−ψ− (x)

However we can only be intersted in points of the main spectrum, as they
can provide admissible (periodic) eigenfunctions of the Lax operator. (1) There
are points λj in the main spectrum where the two eigenfunctions Bloch are
distinct and independent: these points are called degenerate (with the meaning
that for two independent eigenfunctions there is only one eigenvalue). (2) There
are points λj where the two eigenfunctions Bloch are NOT independent: these
points are called nondegenerate. For such values of λ the Wronskian is zero.

The important class of initial conditions u (x, t = 0) with the property that
there is only a ﬁnite number of non-degenerate eigenvalues λj is called ﬁnite-
band potential.

4.4 The “squared” eigenfunctions

Starting from the initial condition u (x, 0) and leting it evolve in time according
to the NSE, u (x, 0) N SE
u (x, t), the discriminant remains invariant. All the
→
spectral structure obtained from the discriminant ∆ (λ), i.e. the main spectrum,
the stability bands, are invariant. The eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix λj
are invariant.

It is shown in Ref.([13]) that the condition on the initial function u (x, 0) for

is equivalent to the requirement that f, g and h be ﬁnite-order polynomials in
j=0 fj (x, t) λj,
the parameter λ, which we take of degree N + 1: f (x, t; λ) =
j=0 hj (x, t) λj. From the Eqs.(48

4.4.2 Product expansion of g and its zeros µj (x, t). Introduction of

the hyperelliptic functions µj

j (x, t). The functions µj (x, t) are called the hyperelliptic
functions. It will be proved below that ﬁnding the hyperelliptic functions leads
immediately to the solution u (x, t).

(cid:3)

Now we calculate the expression in Eq.(55) for λ = a zero of the function g,

i.e. λ is equal to hyperelliptic function µj (x, t):

f 2 (x, t; λ = µm)

gh = f 2 (x, t; µm) = P (λ = µm)

We can see that the problem has been reformulated:

from the equation
for the function u (x, t) the Lax-operators formulation leads to the problem for
Bloch functions, ψ+ and ψ− and their Wronskian; then, using the “squared”
eigenfunctions f , g and h we arrive at a formulation for the hyperelliptic func-
tions µj (x, t) . Finding µj (x, t) leads immediately to u (x, t).

These operations have a signiﬁcative geometric counterpart: every point of
the complex plane of the spectral parameter λ is mapped, via Eq.(55) on the two-

−

1
4 W (x, t; λ) =

P (λ) with singularities at the
sheeted Riemann surface
nondegenerate points of the main spectrum, λj. Removing the indeterminancy
(by cutting and glueing the two sheets) we obtain a hyperelliptic Riemann
surface of genus g = N .
It results that we have to consider the variables
µj (x, t), j = 1, N , as points on this surface but the motion of µj (x, t) is not
simpler than the equation itself.

Now the next steps would be: (1) using the initial condition µj (0, 0) on the
function µj (x, t) we can solve the two equations (58) and (60) and ﬁnd µj (x, t);
(2) then using the initial condition

eliminate the indeterminacy related to the square-root singularities (located
at λj’s) the surfaces must be cut and reglued, obtaining a complex manifold
of complex dimension one, a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. We need some
constructions on this surface.

4.5.1 Holomorphic diﬀerential forms and cycles on the Riemann sur-

face

On this hyperelliptic Riemann surface (denoted M ) it is possible to deﬁne N
linearly independent holomorphic (regular) diﬀerentials. The following is the
canonical basis of diﬀerentials one-forms deﬁned on the manifold M :

dU1 ≡

R (λ)

On the surface M there are 2N topologically distinct closed curves (cycles).
On a torus (N = 1, called elliptic surface) there are two curves which cannot be
deformed one into another. A more general Riemann surface, with N > 1 can
be shown to be equivalent to a sphere with N handles and is called hyperelliptic
Riemann surface. The number N is called the genus of the surface. We have

N = genus of the surface = number of independent holomorphic diﬀerential forms

There are 2N cycles which are split into two classes: aj cycles and bj cycles.
Each of these cycles has a speciﬁed direction (an arrow) attached to it. To
construct the cycles, the rules to be applied are:

1. aj cycles do not cross any other aj cycle; bj cycles do not cross any other

bj cycle;

2. the cycle ak intersects bk only once and intersects no other b cycle;

3. the intersection is such that, at the point of intersection, the vector tangent
to the cycle ak, the vector tangent to the cycle bk and the normal to the
tangent plane of M represent a system of three vectors compatible with
the orientation of M .

This can be represented as:

a

a = 0 , b

◦

b = 0 , aj ◦

◦

bk = δjk

4.5.2 Periods and matrices of periods

With the set of holomorphic diﬀerential forms and the set of cycles we can deﬁne
the matrices of periods, A and B

Zbj
and the matrices A and B are invertible. A change of basis of holomorphic
diﬀerential forms is a linear transformation represented by the matrix C:

4.5.3 The Abel map

The Abel map is deﬁned from the Riemann surface M to the space CN and
associates to a hyperelliptic Riemann surface (a sphere with N hadles) a N -
torus. Using the diﬀerentials dψj one constructs a change of variables by the
following procedure:

choose a base point on M and call it p0;

•

•

deﬁne the variables Wj (x, t) as integrals on the Riemann λ-surface of the
diﬀerential forms from the arbitrary point p0 to the point which is the

order to determine the function u (x, t) we must invert the Abel map, returning
from the variables W to µ. This is the Jacobi inversion problem.

The return from the variables Wj (x, t) of the N -torus back to the variables
µk (x, t) of the Riemann surface M (notice we will only need particular combi-
nations of the functions µ) can be done in an exact way using the Riemann θ
function.

The argument of θ is the N-tuple of complex numbers z

In order to calculate these two quantities, we shall start by introducing a

series of functions , ψj (p) deﬁned on the Riemann surface M :

where p is a point on M , dψj
is the j -th holomorphic diﬀerential form
deﬁned on M and p0 is an arbitrary ﬁxed point on M . The functions ψj (p) are
multiple valued since the contour is deﬁned up to addition of any combination
of the cycles on M .

Now consider the function, F (p):

F (p)

θ (ψ (p)

≡

K

−

where θ is the N -dimensional Riemann theta function associated with the surface
M ; ψ (p) is the N -dimensional column of complex functions ψj (p); K is an

42

N -dimensional column of complex numbers independent of the point p. The
function F (p) is multivalued on the Riemann surface M for the same reason as
ψ: moving the point p on the surface such as to turn around one of the b cycle
and returning to the initial position, the functions ψj will add elements of the τ
matrix. This will make the function F to change as imposed by the properties
of the θ function, shown in Eq.(62).

In order to render the function F single-valued, we replace its domain M by
a new surface, obtained from M by dissecting it in a canonical fashion, along
a basis of cycles. This new surface, M ∗ is simply connected and has the bord
composed of a number of arcs equal to 4N .

This operation is necessary in order to render the function F (p) entire and

allow us deﬁne the inegral

around the contour of the surface M ∗. Applying Cauchy theorem, the integral is
the number of zeroes of F (p) on the surface M ∗. This number is N (Riemann).
We now impose the condition that the N zeros of F (p) coincide with the
. This ﬁxes the values of the N complex numbers
N points
Kj (j = 1, ..., N ). By doing so the contour integral (63) calculated with the
(cid:1)
reziduum theorem will involve the variables µj.

Calculation of the two combination of µ’s We must remember that the
complex λ plane is covered by the two-sheeted Riemann surface whose compact
version is M . Further this is mapped by Abel map onto the Jacobi N -torus. To
a variable on the Riemann surface M (formally also on M ∗), say p, corresponds
a certain λ (p). One deﬁnes the following integrals, which are proved to be real

They can be evaluated by the residuu theorem. By the choice of the constants

5 Stability of the envelope solutions

In this Section we return to the equations obtained by multiple space and time
scales analysis. Then the meaning of the variables φ, y, t is: ﬁrst order (enve-
lope) amplitude of the potential ﬂuctuations in the ion turbulence and respec-
tively large space and slow time variables. We focus on a single NSE in order to
examine the properties of the stability of the solutions. The equation has the

and represents the equation for the envelope of a fast oscillation arising as
solution of the barotropic equation. On inﬁnite spatial domain this equation
has soliton as solutions. On a periodic spatial domain (which is our case) the
solutions can be cnoidal waves and they may be modulationally unstable. The
instability can be examined in the neighbourhood of a solution by imposing
a slight deviation and studying its time behaviour by classical perturbation
expansion. This analysis and comparison with the geometric-algebraic results
have been carried out in Ref.([13]).

Consider φ (y, t) is a solution and perturb it at the initial moment t = 0 as

φ (y, t) = φ (y, 0) + εh (y)

e

The question is to ﬁnd the relative behaviour of the two functions φ (y, t) and
φ (y, t). It they depart exponentially for time close to the initial moment, then
φ (y, t) is an unstable solution. Suppose the initial solution φ (y, t) is the envelope
of an exact plane wave i.e. it is constant in space. As a function of time it must
e
have the form φ (y, t) = p exp (2iqt) and we ﬁnd

φ (y, t) = p exp

45

(the determinant equals zero) can only be fulﬁlled if the factor multiplying the
function of y and t is allways zero. This gives us the dispersion relation

(i.e. for long wavelengths) the two solutions φ (y, t) and
φ (y, t) diverge expo-
nentially in time and the function φ (y, t) is modulationally unstable. From
Eq.(66) we notice that when σ (the Landau coeﬃcient)< 0 and α (the disper-
sion coeﬃcient)> 0 the frequency Ω is real and there is no linear instability.
This remark is useful in connection with the numerical calculations described
above, which connect the physical parameters with the coeﬃcients (α, σ) of the
NSE. Sampling the space of the physical parameters we must retain those points
where the linear instability is possible. In the above formula σ , α and p are di-
mensionless constants and the variables of the equation are normalised : time to
t0 and length to L. The value of p is connected with the frequency of oscillation

For the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation it is possible to follow the perturbed
solution much further in time in an exact manner. In Ref.([13]) it is shown that
from a solution it is possible to return toward the initial time and to recover
the results of the linear analysis. This is possible because the equation can be
exactly solved for initial conditions starting arbitrary close to the envelope of
the plane wave. The case of the plane wave (uniform envelope) is particular due
to the simple form of the main spectrum, as will be discussed below.

5.1 Modulation instability of the envelope of a plane wave

5.1.1 General method

The geometric-algebraic setting of Inverse Scattering Transform is the appro-
priate framework for understanding the nature of the stability of the exact

46

solutions of the NSE. This is because the solution is strongly dependent on
the topology of the hyperelliptic Riemann curve which in turn is dependent on
the initial function. A perturbation of the initial condition may change the
main spectrum turning degenerate eigenvalues into new nondegenerate pairs of
eigenvalues. This means that the hyperelliptic curve will have a diﬀerent genus
N ′ > N and new cycles and diﬀerential forms should be deﬁned. The solution
depends precisely on this topology.

We order to investigate the stability of an exact N -band solution of the NSE
we have to develop in detail the construction of solution. In the particular case
where the solution is the plane wave this analysis is simpler since all the spectral
properties can be found analytically. It has been proved [13] that under the
perturbation of the initial condition the degeneracies in the main spectrum will
be removed and new degrees of freedom will become active. In the new solution
some of the new degrees of freedom have little eﬀect and can be neglected.

5.1.2 Calculation of the main spectrum associated to the uniform

amplitude solution

The unperturbed solution is the envelope of the plane wave, Eq.(65). To de-
teremine the main spectrum, the solution is considered initial condition (at
t = 0) and introduced in the Lax operator. The eigenvalue problem of the Lax
operator has the form

5.1.3 The spectrum of the unperturbed initial condition (case of

plane wave)

We take a set of constants as derived from the numerical calculations that
connects the physical conditions to the coeﬃcients of the NSE, d = 2π
, α =
0.399, σ = 1.452. With these constants we calculate the spectrum on the
complex λ-plane. Although we can have analytical solutions the graphs below
show the diﬃculty of resolving the details of the variation of the functions. To
be noted that the function is intersected with a plane arbitrarly placed at the
magnitude T rM = 5, for easier 3d-representation.

This graph shows the presence of roots on the imaginary axis of λ of the
equation

it is easily to see that for the parameters adopted here, there are three roots of
this equation, while in the graph we can hardly see two of them. A graphical

better way of ﬁnding these roots is to look for the intersections of the contours
of the two equations:

Re (T rM )

2 = 0
Im (T rM ) = 0

where, again, the other two roots cannot be easily resolved. However the
analytical expression allows to ﬁnd the positions of the roots both on the Re λ
axis and on the Im λ axis:

By contrast, the variation along the real λ axis easily evidences the zeroes

of the corresponding to the main spectrum.

The stability or instability of the Bloch fuctions (i.e.

the values of the
quantity m (λ) which is the eigenvalue of the monodromy matrix) is governed
by the discriminant ∆ (λ). We have
2 6 ∆ (λ) 6 2 for all real λ and for
1 6 α 6 1. The main spectrum corresponds to the values of λ for

5.1.4 The spectrum of the perturbed initial condition (case of plane

wave)

Starting from an initial condition slightly diﬀerent of the plane wave’s envelope

u (y, 0)

u (y, 0) + εh (y)

→

(70)

we shall have to repeat all steps in the determination of the spectrum. This must
be done in a comparative manner, identifying the degenerate eigenvalues λj of
the main spectrum which becomes nondegenerate after perturbation. The time
behaviour of the exact solution developing from the perturbed initial condition
is dominated by the imaginary part of the variables W which are obtained on
the basis of the new (perturbed) quantities µj and this can be calculated.

Using the new initial condition Eq.(70) we shall calculate the new main
spectrum, i.e. the new values of the parameter λ for which the discriminant
is
2. All the spectrum of the simple initial condition u (y, 0) is perturbed by
order-ε quantities. The main eﬀect of this perturbation is that the degeneracies
are broken. In order to construct the exact solution corresponding to the new

position of the nondegenerate λ values, we need to specify the cycles on the two-
sheeted Riemann surface. The steps are as usual and consists of ﬁrst choosing
the cycles on the Riemann surface and the base of the holomorphic diﬀerentials;
then, compute the matrices of periods (the matrix of a periods, and the matrix
of the b periods); compute the τ matrix; construct the Abel map, which maps
the points of the compact two-sheeted Riemann surface onto the Jacobi torus;
ﬁnd the wavenumbers and the frequencies in the Jacobi manifold; make the
Jacobi inversion, using the theta functions;

results that: the oﬀ-diagonal terms of the τ matrix does not carry any

The main conclusion is: (1) The real-λ axis degenaracies have Ωj real so
they are linearly stable. The imaginary axis degeneracies have Ωj imaginary so
they are linearly unstable.

This conclusion can have important practical eﬀects:

in our case the de-
generate eigenvalues on the imaginary λ-axis split and induce instability of the
plane wave solution, i.e. of the envelope. At the same time the solutio evolves
toward one of the stable (soliton-like) solutions. Still much work is required to
examine the stability of that solution to additional perturbation. For example,
the main spectrum of the solution of the type sec h(y) can be obtained from
the discriminant whose form is very complicated, with many purely imaginary
(dangerous) eigenvalues.

be left and the turbulence amplitude will develop a poloidal asymmetry which
grows expenentially in time. The onset of the poloidal asymmetry will induce a
asymmetric rate of transport on the poloidal direction [12]. When the particle
diﬀusion is poloidally asymmetric and the local particle conﬁnement time is
shorter than the damping time of the poloidal rotation, the poloidal rotation
is unstable. The plasma can spontaneously spin-up. The growth rate of the
asymmetry (which is given by the rate of departure from the uniform solution

in the poloidal direction. Any torque acting to generate a poloidal rotation
must overcome the neoclassical magnetic pumping, which is an eﬃcient damping
mechanism. A balance of these forces depends on the comparison between
the rates of (1) asymmetry growth, and (2) rate of damping through magnetic
pumping.

The quantities

vr and vr are velocities which arise from diﬀusive ﬂuxes in

It is known that any friction force which is exerted in the magnetic surface
and is not parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld generates a particle ﬂux in the radial
direction. The equation of motion at equilibrium

The second velocity has a trigonometric variation on the poloidal direction. This
asymmetry can be induced by the poloidal variation of the diﬀusive ﬂux (related
to a poloidal variation of the friction force Rin) or because the radial diﬀusive
ﬂux depends on the poloidal coordinate (has poloidal asymmetry):

second term in Eq.(72) is determined by the space variation of the these factors
and is decissive for the possibility of generating rotation. We note however
that, quantitaively, this term which is the torque applied to plasma, can be
comparable to the magnetic pumping term at strong density gradients and small
ion-ion collisionality.

7 Discussion

We have examined the problem of stability of the envelope of the ion wave turbu-
lence. Starting from a simple model for the ion dynamics and retaining the full
nonlinear contribution of the ion polarization current we have derived an equa-
tion of the same form as the barotropic model of the atmosphere. The multiple
space-time scale analysis shows that the envelope of the turbulence results from
a set of coupled cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equations. The simplest solution is
the space-constant envelope corresponding to a symmetric average amplitude of
the turbulence on the poloidal circumference. In order to examine the stability
of this solution we ﬁrst review the method of inverse scattering transform in
the geometric-algebraic framework, able to obtain the exact solution developing
from a certain class of initial conditions (ﬁnite-band potentials). In this frame-
work appears clear the origin of the sensitivity to the perturbations, connected
to the topology of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. The uniform solution is
unstable and evolves to one of the soliton-type solution. The nonuniformity of
the turbulence average proﬁle generates a torque on the plasma, which may be
suﬃcient to overcome the poloidal damping.

58

The simple physical model we have employed may be partly justiﬁed by the
observation that the analysis is essentially independent of the other possible
sources of poloidal asymmetry: the neoclassical variation of parameters on the
magnetic surface, the toroidal eﬀect on the nonlinearity represented as mode
coupling, the eﬀect of the particle drifts on the linear and renormalized propa-
gators, etc. The cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation has many solutions on the
periodic domain and the relevance for the self-modulation of the envelope of the
turbulence should be examined. Here we only considered the uniform envelope
since its instability can be suﬃcient to induce plasma poloidal rotation. This
rotation has an origin diﬀerent of the usual sources of rotation: neoclassical,
ion-loss, Reynolds stress or momentum injection. Our approach is essentially
mathematical and so it operates at a more formal level. The physical origin
of the instability seems to be the tendency of the system (averaged amplitude
of the turbulence) to evolve to proﬁles characterised by the balance of the dis-
persion and the nonlinearity. What remains to be examined is the quantitative
constraint on the minimal initial perturbation needed to produce a particular
evolution: for a weak perturbation the solution may be simple “radiation” while
for initially larger amplitude a soliton emerges ensuring higher robustness and
a localised form. It is in this case that the asymmetry can induce plasma ro-
tation. This question can be answered by examining the exact solution, with
speciﬁc numerical tools for the determination of the main spectrum. It might
be possible that the Riemann curve is not a hyperelliptic surface but a manifold
close to a ﬁnite-genus curve.

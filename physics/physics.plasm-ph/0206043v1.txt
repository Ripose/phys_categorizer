Abstract

The dynamics of linear perturbations in a radiatively cooling dusty plasma

is considered, with the charge of both dust (Zd) and plasma (Zp) components

being allowed to vary with their densities.

It is shown that in the long-

wavelength limit corresponding to the characteristic cooling length, when the

plasma can be treated as quasineutral, the presence of dust particles changes

the criteria for radiation instability, regardless the charging process of the dust

particles. In particular, the condensation (isobaric) mode is shown to be stabi-

lized (destabilized) if in the equilibrium, the relation between densities of the

dust nd and plasma n under the quasineutrality condition, (d ln nd/d ln n)q < 1

(> 1) is satisﬁed, while the isentropic mode is stabilized (destabilized) when

the opposite inequalities take place; the isochoric mode is unaltered. Numeri-

cal estimates show that these eﬀects can be important in hot phases (T

106

∼

K) of the interstellar plasma, and in tokamak plasma near the walls.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well known (see, for example, Refs. 1, 2, 3) that the presence of charged dust particles

in plasma changes its dispersion properties qualitatively, and that the dust itself can give

rise to new plasma instabilities. From intuitive point of view it seems possible that dust

must be important in dynamics of radiatively cooling plasmas, not only because it absorbs

radiation, but also due to its ability to transform thermal energy of the plasma into radiation

in inelastic collisions with electrons and ions. Apparently, it can be of great importance in

high temperature (T >
∼

106 K) cosmic and laboratory (in particular, close to tokamak walls)

plasmas, where frequent collisions with the ions maintain dust particles suﬃciently hot, so

that they re-emit thermal energy eﬃciently4. The present work is aimed to analyze the eﬀects

of charged dust particles on the conditions for the radiation instabilities. It is important to

note that this issue has been addressed recently in5,6, however in these papers dust particles

were considered only from the point of view of electrostatic interactions, while the cooling

processes were treated as independent on the presence of dust. In our study we explicitly

assume that dust particles contribute substantially to the net cooling rate, which brings to

the system qualitatively new dynamical features. For the sake of simplicity we will consider

here only highly ionized plasmas, when the eﬀects from neutral particles can be neglected.

In Sec. II.A we brieﬂy discuss how important can be dust as a cooler of the plasma.

In

Sec. II.B we formulate a simpliﬁed two-ﬂuid model of a collisional and radiatively cooling

dusty plasma.

In Sec.

III.A we describe the steady state equilibrium, with the relevant

parameters estimated in Sec.

III.B, while in Sec.

III.C linearized equations are written.

In Sec.

III.D the dispersion equation and its solutions are given and criteria of thermal

instability in diﬀerent wavelength ranges are discussed. Sec. IV summarizes the results.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

A. Radiatively cooling dusty plasma

In an optically thin plasma dust particles, if present, besides their dynamical eﬀects through

electrostatic interaction with plasma particles, can also work as a cooling agent via the

collisional transfer of thermal energy of plasma component into infrared radiation. If one

assumes, as an idealization, that dust particles emit as black body, the energy loss rate due to

dust particles varies as

T 4
d , where Td is temperature of the dust. For realistic particles this

dependence can be steeper. Detailed calculations of the relevant cooling rate are made in Ref.

4. They show that for physical conditions and abundance of dust typical for the interstellar

medium (ISM), radiation losses from dust particles dominates cooling from the line emission

of heavy elements by two orders of magnitude in the interval T = 106

1010 K 4. One should

−

stress, however, that at temperatures T

3

(107

×
destroyed in collisions with the ions and electrons7, and therefore only in temperature range

−

∼

between 106 K and 3

107 K dust contributes suﬃciently to the net cooling. Apparently,

dust cooling can also be important in tokamak plasma near the walls, where temperature

∝

×

can lie in this interval, or in regions of MARFEs (multifaceted asymmetric radiation from

the edge) formation if radiating impurities are introduced into the plasma by sputtering.

We will consider a simpliﬁed two-ﬂuid approach, with the dust charge instantaneously

(on times much shorter than other characteristic time scales of the system) settled on the

equilibrium Zd = Zd(n, nd, T ), where n and nd are the plasma and dust densities, T is the

plasma temperature. To outline the main physical eﬀects, we will study the simple case of

potential perturbations in the planar geometry. The full set of equations in this case is

Eq. 5 is omitted; ∂a and da denote partial and Lagrangian derivatives with respect to a. In

general, dust particles contribute both to heating (e.g. via photoemission of electrons from

grain surface, see for recent discussion Ref. 8), and cooling (via collisional transfer of kinetic

energy of plasma particles into heat of dust grains and subsequent re-emission in, as a rule,

infrared range4). It is obvious that the charge separation are important only on the spatial

scales comparable (or shorter) to Debye length, on longer lengths plasma can be treated as

quasineutral (see, below).

III. DISPERSION RELATION

A. Unperturbed state

We assume that in an unperturbed state radiative cooling is balanced by energy input

from external sources (e.g. hard emission, Ohmic heating etc.), so that

= 0,

L

[note that in most cases the net cooling function can be presented in the form

=

L(T, n, nd)n

Γ(T, n, nd)n, where L(T, n, nd)n is the radiative cooling rate, Γ(T, n, nd)n,

the heating rate due to external energy sources]. We assume also that unperturbed plasma

−

is quasineutral

Zd0nd0 + Zp0n0 = 0.

(9)

We will further assume that the dust and plasma charges adjust the corresponding equi-

libria instantaneously Zd = Zd(n, nd, T ) and Zp = Zp(n, nd, T ),

i.e.

that the charging

characteristic times are shorter than other relevant times.

B. Evaluation of the relevant numbers

The problem is characterized by three time scales: thermal, frictional, and electrostatic.

Thermal time scale is written as

here L0 is the radiative cooling rate taken at the equilibrium, kB, Boltzmann constant.

All characteristic times (frictional and electrostatic) relevant to the dust component are

connected with the corresponding plasma times by the intrinsic constants δ = nd0/n0, the

concentration of dust particles, and µ = mdnd0/mn0

ρd0/ρ0, the mass density ratio of the

≡

dust and plasma components:

τf,d = µτf ,

τe,d = δ−1µ−1/2τe.

It is readily seen that two dimensionless parameters appear in the problem

which characterize the role of electrostatic and frictional forces in dynamics of radiation-

condensation instability.

C. Linearized equations

(21)

where the unperturbed variables are given with subscript zero, a0, while the perturbations

are without subscript, a.

In order to evaluate the interrelation between electrostatic and radiative eﬀects it is

useful to write the linearized Poisson equation 21 in a non-dimensional form

ξ = x/τ0c0, where c0 is the isothermal sound speed, the potential is normalized to mc2

0/e, κ

is deﬁned above.

For typical interstellar or tokamak hot plasma at T

106 K, κ can be estimated as

∼

,

It is readily seen from these estimates that motions on electrostatic and radiation scales can

be separated due to a huge diﬀerence in corresponding times and lengths. This simply means

that electrostatic forces acting between the charged dust and plasma components keep dusty

plasma quasineutral on much shorter time scales than the relevant hydrodynamical scales.

Formally it can be expressed in the form of perturbation procedure applied to the above

dimensionless linearized equations with dynamical variables as a series

and potential as

a = a0 + κ

−2a1 + ..,

φ = κ−2φ1 + κ−4φ2 + ...

7

Thus in what follows we turn to the dimensional variables and equations, with the quasineu-

trality condition instead of solving Poisson equation.

(22)

(24)

(25)

D. Dispersion equation

In this framework the quasineutrality equation can be written in terms of nd

[Zd0 + (∂ndZd)nd0 + (∂ndZp)n0]−1[(∂T Zd)nd0 + (∂T Zp)n0]T.

From Eq. (26) it follows that (∂T nd)q =

[Zd0 + (∂ndZd)nd0 + (∂ndZp)n0]−1[(∂T Zd)nd0 +

(∂T Zp)n0], which will be taken as zero in order that the quasineutrality to hold for purely

this equation is identical to the standard dispersion equation9, when all terms correspondent

In general, there are three solutions of Eq. 28. One corresponds to the so-called isobaric

trary, if quasineutrality and dust charging requires an enhancement of dust particles in

compressed regions, i.e. (d ln nd/d ln n)q > 1, the condensation instability is enhanced. Qual-

itatively it can be understood as due to an enhancement of the net cooling rate associated

with dust cooling.

It is seen from (34) that contrary to the isobaric mode, isentropic perturbations are destabi-

lized if (d ln nd/d ln n)q < 1, since the restrictions on the cooling rate

c is here weaker than

L

in the absence of electrostatic forces. Instead, isentropic perturbations are stabilized when

(d ln nd/d ln n)q > 1. Such a behavior is qualitatively clear because the instability of isen-

tropic mode is physically connected with overheating of adiabatically compressed regions,

and as soon as dust cooling decreases in compressed regions when (d ln nd/d ln n)q < 1, it

results in an additional overheating.

(33)

(34)

The instability criterion for the isochoric mode corresponding to the long-wavelength limit

D3. Isochoric mode

V. SUMMARY

In the present paper we considered radiation instability in an optically thin dusty plasma

with dust particles contributing substantially to the radiative energy losses. We have shown

that combination of the two eﬀects: electrostatic interaction of the dust and plasma com-

ponents and their tight dynamical coupling (expressed in quasineutrality), and additional

energy losses connected with dust particles, strongly modiﬁes the criteria for the instability.

This inﬂuence diﬀers for diﬀerent instability regimes: the isobaric (condensation) mode is

10

6
shown to be destabilized in dusty plasmas if the dust particles are excessively attracted in

the regions of gas compression, (d ln nd/d ln n)q > 1, and stabilized in the opposite case; in

the short-wavelength limit corresponding to the isentropic (adiabatic) mode eﬀects from the

presence of dust work diﬀerently: they quench the instability when (d ln nd/d ln n)q > 1, and

destabilize it in the opposite case; the condition for the instability remains unaltered in a

long-wavelength range where isochoric mode dominates.

In a simplest case of a dilute hot plasma with dust particles charged predominantly

collisionally, i.e. jp →

0, (d ln nd/d ln n)q approaches unity from below as (see Appendix)

and therefore the isobaric mode is quenched, while the isentropic is weakly enhanced.

As jp approaches the critical value jpc = (mi/me)1/2

1, when dust particles change

−

the charge from negative to positive, (d ln nd/d ln n)q → −∞
(d ln nd/d ln n)q →
the critical point, jp = jpc −
mode is strongly quenched, while the isentropic is strongly enhanced. Contrary, from the

at jp = jpc + 0, (see Appendix). Therefore, from the left side of

0 where the charging is dominated by collisions, the isobaric

at jp = jpc −

0, and

∞

+

right side of the critical point, jp = jpc + 0 where the grains are charged predominantly by

photoionization, the isobaric mode is enhanced, while the isentropic one is suppressed.

One can therefore conclude that in hot and dilute astrophysical plasmas embedded in

a strong radiation ﬁeld, where radiation dominates dust charging, the thermally unstable

isobaric mode is enhanced. Under the conditions of an exposing radiation ﬁeld with an

intensity well below the critical value (such as in astrophysical plasmas far from strong

radiation sources and dusty plasma sheaths near the tokamak walls) when the collisional

processes are the principal charging mechanisms, isentropic mode is destabilized, while the

isobaric one is quenched.

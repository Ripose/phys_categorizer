Abstract

We argue that the Maxwellian approximation can essentially underestimate the
rates of some nuclear reactions in hot plasma under conditions very close to ther-
mal equilibrium. This phenomenon is demonstrated explicitly on the example of
reactions in self-sustained DT fusion plasma with admixture of light elements X =
Li, Be, C. A kinetic analysis shows that the reactivity enhancement results from
non-Maxwellian knock-on perturbations of ion distributions caused by close colli-
sions with energetic fusion products. It is found that although the fraction of the
knock-on ions is small, these particles appreciably aﬀect the D+X and T+X reac-
tion rates. The phenomenon discussed is likely to have general nature and can play
role in other laboratory and probably astrophysical plasma processes.

1 Introduction

The concept of nuclear reaction rate is broadly used in high-temperature
plasma research. This rate determines reaction yield and ultimately speciﬁc
nuclear power released in plasma. The yield of a reaction between plasma
species 1 and 2 is given by

Y (1+2) = αn1n2hσvi12,

where α = 1/2 or 1 for identical or diﬀerent colliding nuclei, respectively,
n1 and n2 are species densities. The key quantity in (1) is the reaction rate
parameter hσvi12 deﬁned as the six-dimensional integral in velocity space

where µ is the reduced mass of the colliding particles, E is their kinetic energy
in the center-of-mass frame, T is the plasma ion temperature. The Maxwellian
approximation is a conventional tool to study plasma under conditions close
to thermal equilibrium. At the same time, however, ion distribution functions
in high-temperature plasma strictly speaking are not purely Maxwellian. A
reason of non-Maxwellian deviation lies in exothermic nuclear reactions pro-
ceeding in the plasma. These reactions generate energetic projectiles which
during slowing-down aﬀect the formation of ion distributions. Charged par-
ticles slow down in the plasma mainly via peripheral (small-angle) Coulomb
scattering by thermal ions and electrons. This mechanism does not change
the equilibrium form of ion distribution. However, since the energy of reaction
products can reach several MeV, close (large-angle) collisions between them
and thermal ions can also take place in the plasma. The probability of close
collisions is determined by amplitudes of Coulomb and nuclear scattering,
and their interference term. Although such processes occur at rare opportu-
nity, they can transfer in a single event a large amount of energy and produce
fast knock-on ions. These ions increase the population of high-energy tails
of respective distributions, so that some deviation from Maxwellian functions
appears. Apart from energetic charged particles, reaction-produced neutrons
can also contribute to the knock-on perturbation mechanism if the plasma is
suﬃciently dense.

Since the Maxwellian approximation has widely been used in laboratory and
astrophysical plasma studies, a natural question arises whether the knock-
on perturbation of ion distribution could in some cases appreciably change
reaction rates and aﬀect power balance in hot plasma systems. It has been
recognized that for conventional DT and DD fusion plasmas the answer is
negative. The combination of three factors – sizable reaction probabilities at
thermal energies where the majority of ion population is concentrated, small
fractions of knock-on deuterons and tritons, and moderate energy dependences
of the fusion cross sections in the energy range associated with these fast ions –

2

makes the above processes poorly sensitive to slight modiﬁcations of D and T
distribution tails. This especially concerns the resonant D+T reaction whose
cross section has a broad maximum at deep sub-barrier energies. However, in
systems composed of nuclei with Z > 1 the situation has still been intriguing.
In such a system strong Coulomb repulsion suppresses transmission probability
through the potential barrier between interacting nuclei and, in the absence
of pronounced low-energy resonances, the behavior of reaction cross section
becomes steep at least at sub-barrier (sub-MeV) energy range. This suggests
that the respective reaction can be sensitive to the form of ion distribution
tail, so that the suprathermal reaction channel induced by knock-on ions may
become appreciable. The purpose of this letter is to investigate the possible
enhancement of nuclear reaction rates due to knock-on perturbations of ion
distributions.

2 Semi-qualitative consideration

One can reproduce such situation in a simple two-temperature model. Let
us describe ion distributions in a plasma as superposition of two functions
f + f ′. The ﬁrst one is Maxwellian; it represents the behavior of bulk ions with
density n and temperature T . The second function is introduced to model the
ensemble of knock-on ions with density n′ < n. We assume that f ′ also is
Maxwellian with some temperature T ′ > T . Then the total reaction yield (1)
can be presented as

Y (1+2) = Ybulk × (1 + λ),
(4)
where Ybulk = αn1n2R(T1, T2) is the thermal yield provided by bulk particles,
while λ gives the suprathermal correction caused by bulk-fast and fast-fast ion
interactions

Here R denotes hσvi for the 1+2 reaction between Maxwellian species with
diﬀerent temperatures. Substituting Maxwellian distributions with tempera-
tures θ1 and θ2 for f u
2 in (2), we ﬁnd that the two-temperature rate
parameter R(θ1, θ2) can be reduced to the reactivity R(Tef f ) for Maxwellian
plasma (3) with some eﬀective temperature Tef f :

R(θ1, θ2) = R(Tef f ), Tef f =

.

This allows one to easily estimate λ. Let us consider, as an example, diﬀerent
D+X systems: symmetric (X = D), nearly symmetric and resonant (X = T),
asymmetric and involving light nuclei (X = Li, Be). We assume that only the
D distribution is distorted, while the other particles are Maxwellian. It seems

3

reasonable to set bulk temperatures of D and X nearly equal, TD ≃ TX = T ,
and neglect the contribution of the fast-fast ion interaction term in (5). Under
these conditions (5) takes the form

(7)

where β equals 2 (X=D) or 1 (X6= D). Choosing T = 10 keV typical of fusion
plasma level and varying the unknown temperature T ′
D in the 50–200 keV wide
range, we ﬁnd that the ratio R(T ′
D, T )/R(T ) changes approximately within 8–
50 (D+D), 5×102–5×103 (D+6Li), 103–5×104 (D+7Li), 6×103–7×105 (D+7Be),
8×103–6×105 (D+9Be). For the D+T reaction this ratio changes from 6.29 to
6.35, i.e. proves to be nearly constant. Such invariant-like behavior with re-
spect to T ′
D results from resonant nature of the D+T reaction, due to which its
reactivity rapidly increases at low temperature, peaks around 60 keV and then
becomes essentially insensitive to plasma temperature. Thus, in the D+Li and
D+Be systems a very small fraction of knock-on deuterons n′
D/nD < 0.1%
makes the contribution of thermal and suprathermal reaction components
comparable, while for the D+T and D+D reactions the eﬀect is rather imper-
ceptible. One should keep in mind, however, that these results give approx-
imate picture because the two-temperature model does not reproduce true
form of particle distributions. Indeed, the knock-on ions are not Maxwellian;
at least their distribution should be truncated at some critical energy deter-
mined by kinematics for particle collision. Nevertheless, the above estimations
indicate that the problem really stands and it is worth studying rigorously.

3 Plasma kinetic analysis

In the present work we employ an appropriate plasma kinetic model to study
the phenomenon on the example of various reactions in self-sustained DT
fusion plasma with admixture of light elements. The concentration of these
elements is assumed to be suﬃciently low to neglect their role when analyz-
ing the behavior of main plasma species – fuel ions and 3.5-MeV α-particles
born in DT fusions. It was shown (see, for example, [1,2,3,4]) that these ener-
getic α-particles are responsible for non-Maxwellian perturbations of fuel ion
distributions due to α-D and α-T close collisions. We describe the behavior
of plasma species a (deuterons, tritons, α-particles) with isotropic velocity
distributions in terms of a Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck (BFP) equation. The
BFP equation at steady-state without external heating can be written in the
following form [4,5]:

taking diﬀerent forms for every ion species. Plasma electrons are considered to
be Maxwellian at some temperature Te incorporated in our model by using a
global power-balance (GPB) equation. This equation determines the relation
between plasma density and temperature, and has the simple form

Pheat(ni, Ti) − Pbrem(ni, ne, Te) − Pc.p.(ni, ne, Ti, Te) = 0.

(12)

Here Pheat is the plasma heating rate by α-particles, Pbrem is the rate of
bremsstrahlung energy loss, Pc.p. gives the energy loss due to thermal conduc-
tion and particle leak. At chosen Te, being an input parameter in our model,
plasma density is estimated from (12) assuming ne ≃ nd + nt and Te ≃ Ti.

terms in the BFP and GPB equations one can ﬁnd in [4].

distribution reveals moderate energy dependence in the 0.1–3.5 MeV deceler-
ation range, while at thermal energies it is described by Maxwellian-like form.

Now we can examine the inﬂuence of the knock-on ions on reaction rates in
the DT/X plasma. In the present study the admixture ions X are chosen to
be Li, Be, C. These light elements are often considered as low-Z impurity
in magnetic conﬁnement fusion devices. For example, Li was already used in
operation of TFTR [11], ASDEX and TEXTOR tokamaks, W-7 AS stellarator
[12,13], and has been proposed as a diagnostic admixture for fusion machines
of next generation [14,15,16]. Be and C have been vigorously used for plasma
diagnostics in JET [17,18]. In order to make the study most informative we
examine the variety of reactions having diﬀerent mechanisms. They are listed
in Table 1 including some processes proposed for plasma γ-ray spectroscopy,
the energy-producing Li(d, α) and tritium-breeding Li(d, pt) reactions, the
conventional D+T and D+D fusion processes. The respective reaction cross
sections are plotted in Fig. 2.

To calculate hσvi for the distorted isotropic distributions of D and T, we
reduce the general expression for reactivity (2) to the form

puted at ion temperature Ti = 10–40 keV. The results are plotted in Figs. 3
and 4, and also displayed in Table 1. We see that although the fraction of the
knock-on ions is only 0.03 %, these particles appreciably aﬀect the D+X and
T+X reactivity. It is underestimated if Maxwellian DT plasma is assumed,
and for some reactions the discrepancy between the two approaches becomes
crucial. The ratio δ = hσvi/hσviMxw monotonically increases with decreasing
Ti down to the plasma ignition point, and for the exothermic reactions pre-
sented in Fig. 3 it changes approximately within 1.5–2.5 (D+Li), 2–8 (T+Li)
and 3–50 (D+Be). Special attention is worth being paid to the endothermic
T+Li and D+C reactions displayed in Fig. 4. Here δ turns out to be several
orders of magnitude or more, that reﬂects threshold nature of these processes.
Both of them are forbidden at energies below thresholds, so only suﬃciently
fast ions contribute to the reactions. At the same time, Fig. 1 shows that the
amount of these particles is essentially underestimated in Maxwellian plasma.
The record enhancement is marked for D+C; the high threshold and strong
Coulomb suppression of the thermal channel make the role of the knock-on
deuterons extremely important here. Thus, the both reactions proceed via
suprathermal channels and are solely governed by knock-on ions. This may
have interesting applications in fusion technology. For example, 0.981-MeV
photons emitted in 6Li(t, p1) might be applicable to energetic triton and α-
particle diagnostics [4].

In agreement with the comments in Section 1 we ﬁnd that the knock-on ions
do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the D+T and D+D reactions. Table 1 shows that
the enhancement factor δ does not exceed 1 % (D+T) and 7 % (D+D).

We have presented arguments that the Maxwellian approximation can essen-
tially underestimate reaction rates in nearly thermal-equilibrium plasma, and
explicitly demonstrated this phenomenon for some reactions in the DT/X
plasma. The enhancement of reactivity results from the knock-on perturba-

tions of ion distributions caused by close collisions with energetic fusion prod-
ucts. The numerical analysis carried out in the work is consistent with the
semi-qualitative consideration, but the level of reactivity enhancement marked
has turned out to be surprisingly high.

The phenomenon is likely to have general nature and can play role in other
plasma systems. This especially concerns threshold nuclear processes – our
study indicates that evaluation of their rates within the Maxwellian approx-
imation can involve dramatic errors and prove to be fully useless. It seems
possible that knock-on ions can aﬀect power balance and even reduce ignition
temperature for some exotic fuels, in which conditions favorable for the non-
Maxwellian pumping of ion distributions can be realized. The aneutronic 3He
plasma would be an interesting object for such a study. Indeed, the 3He+3He
reaction has large Q = 12.9 MeV, generates fast charged particles and exhibits
an appropriate cross section behavior. The reaction cross section rapidly and
monotonically rises with increasing energy up to the MeV region.

Apart from laboratory plasmas, the phenomenon discussed may also appear
in some astrophysical processes. Primordial plasma is of particular importance
here. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) relies on nuclear reaction net-
work involving Maxwellian reactivity, and accuracy of nuclear inputs has been
under attention [19,20]. If the mechanism of non-Maxwellian deviation would
come into play under BBN speciﬁc conditions, it could update input reactivi-
ties and thereby oﬀer new insight into synthesis of light elements in the early
universe. Analysis of this scenario requires coupled cosmological and plasma
kinetic calculations which were beyond the scope of our work. However, the
demonstration that a very small, almost negligible fraction of knock-on parti-
cles (∼ 10−4) in hot plasma can signiﬁcantly change the rates of some reactions
gives impetus to such study.

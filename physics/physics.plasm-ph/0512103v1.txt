Meteor generated plasma columns in E-region ionosphere: ﬁelds and diffusion

Y. S. Dimant∗ and M. M. Oppenheim†
Boston University
(Dated: February 2, 2014)

A meteoroid penetrating the Earth’s atmosphere leaves behind a trail of dense plasma in the E-region iono-
sphere, a region where electrons are strongly magnetized while ions are demagnetized due to their frequent
collisions with neutrals. While radar measurements of meteor trail evolution have been collected and used to
infer meteor and atmospheric properties since the 1950s, no accurate quantitative model of trail ﬁelds and diffu-
sion exists. This paper describes a theory and simulations of trail plasma physics which applies to the majority
of small meteors. Unlike earlier papers, our theory assumes a signiﬁcant angle between the geomagnetic ﬁeld
and the plasma trail and includes the important interaction between the trail and the background ionospheric
plasma. This study provides quantitative knowledge of the spatial distribution and dynamics of the plasma den-
sity and electric ﬁeld. This should enable meteor and atmospheric researchers to more accurately interpret radar
observations of specular and non-specular meteor echoes.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Meteoroids impacting the Earth’s upper atmosphere have a
number of important consequences by: depositing material,
most notably metals and dust; damaging spacecraft; creating
layers of material which radars and ionosondes detect; modi-
fying the plasma density and conductivity of the lower iono-
sphere; leaving plasma columns which can be used for meteor
burst communication and to monitor atmospheric conditions
in the lower thermosphere. While large meteoroids gener-
ate spectacular optical displays, particles much smaller than a
sand grain comprise the majority of all meteoroids and repre-
sent the major source of all extra-terrestrial material deposited
in the Earth’s atmosphere [1, 2]. Such small meteoroids can
rarely be observed by a naked eye or even by a sensitive opti-
cal technique, but radars can easily detect them. Such obser-
vations become possible because meteoroids frequently enter
the Earth’s atmosphere with a sufﬁcient speed (11–72 km/s)
and energy to cause the formation of a dense plasma visible
to radars. The front edge of this plasma can often be observed
by high-power large-aperture (HPLA) radars, while smaller,
lower-power radars can detect the residual trail as either spec-
ular or non-specular echoes.

Specular echoes, usually observed by small-aperture and
HF-VHF radars, originate from parts of the plasma trail where
the wavevector of the backscattered wave is nearly perpendic-
ular to the axis of a slowly diffusing, quasi-cylindrical plasma
trail (for review, see [2]). Non-specular meteor echoes ob-
served by HPLA VHF or UHF radars like the one shown in
Fig. 1 originate from trails where the specular condition is
not necessarily satisﬁed but where the radar typically points
close to perpendicular to the geomagnetic ﬁeld [3, 4, 5, 6].
Non-specular echoes appear to result from small-scale elec-
tron density irregularities caused by plasma turbulence and
measured when the radar wavevector lies parallel to the ir-
regularity wavevector but with a wavenumber twice the irreg-
ularity wavenumber, satisfying the Bragg condition. A polar-

ization electric ﬁeld, resulting from the plasma trail ambipo-
lar diffusion, drives ﬁeld-aligned instabilities which generate
these irregularities [7, 8].

Modeling specular echoes requires knowledge of the spa-
tial and temporal distribution of the plasma trail density, while
modeling non-specular trails also requires knowledge of the
evolution and structure of the polarization electric ﬁeld which
drives the instabilities. In a series of papers [8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
Oppenheim, Dyrud and others have simulated the develop-
ment of plasma instabilities in the meteor trail under con-
ditions when the axis of an axially-symmetric cylindrical
plasma trail was perfectly aligned with the geomagnetic ﬁeld
[or, in a two-dimensional (2D) case, making the trail a slab
instead of a cylinder]. This is, however, a degenerate case be-
cause most of meteor trails are oriented at a signiﬁcant angle
with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld. In the general case, elec-
trons have anisotropic responses to the electric ﬁeld, which
signiﬁcantly complicates theoretical description of the dense
plasma trail evolution.

A number of studies have looked at the evolution of a dense
plasma column in a collisional magnetized plasma. The ear-
liest simulations [14, 15, 16] had restricted box sizes which
could not properly describe the actual ionospheric situation.

Furthermore, numerical simulations alone cannot provide the
parameter dependence of the plasma density and polarization
electric ﬁeld, which is of importance for modeling plasma in-
stabilities. At the same time, analytical theory, even an ap-
proximate one, could provide such dependencies and would
be an indispensable tool for the accurate interpretation of radar
observations, meteoric and ionospheric diagnostics.

The analytical theory by Jones [17] represents a signiﬁcant
step forward. He proposed a 2D self-similar solution (SSS)
of the meteor trail evolution, starting from an initial line den-
sity. Using a combination of a Gaussian spatial distribution of
the plasma density with a parabolic distribution of the electric
potential, Jones developed a mathematical scheme, which de-
scribes the initial evolution and structure of the trail plasma
density reasonably well. However, it improperly describes the
spatial structure of the polarization electric ﬁeld because the
assumed plasma density structure requires that the ﬁeld goes
to inﬁnity with distance from the trail axis. As we show in
this paper, that theory also fails to predict signiﬁcant devia-
tions from the self-similar diffusion at a later stage of the me-
teor trail evolution. The reason for this is that the SSS does
not account for interaction with the background ionospheric
plasma.

In the earlier stage of plasma trail diffusion, the background
plasma density is usually small compared to the plasma den-
sity within the trail. However, this low-density plasma plays
a crucial role for carrying electric currents originating from
the trail during its ambipolar diffusion. This current signiﬁ-
cantly affects the evolution and structure of the trail density in
the later stage. Further, the electrodynamic interaction of the
meteor trail with the background ionosphere provides a nat-
ural restriction for the polarization electric ﬁeld which drives
plasma instabilities. The research presented in this paper in-
cludes the interaction of the trail with the background iono-
sphere.

Note that in a recent theoretical paper on meteor trail diffu-
sion, Robson [18] (see also [19]) attempted to revise the previ-
ous theories. Robson’s approach, however, seems invalid be-
cause, in addition to the quasineutral assumption, Robson as-
sumed that the electron and ion ﬂuxes along the magnetic ﬁeld
are equal. In the general case, the latter assumption causes the
resulting electric ﬁeld to have a signiﬁcant non-zero curl. Es-
timates show, however, that the contribution of the induction
electric ﬁeld to the trail dynamics in the E region is negligible,
so that to high accuracy the electric ﬁeld within and around the
trail should be electrostatic, i.e., curl-free (see Sect. VIII ).

In order to improve modeling of non-specular trails and en-
hance our knowledge of plasma column diffusion and ﬁelds,
we revisit this problem. As in the majority of the previous
studies, we restrict ourselves to plasma columns that remain
homogeneous along their length and assume constant electron
and ion temperatures. Homogeneity along the trail implies
that diffusion occurs only in the plane perpendicular to the
trail, though electron ﬂuxes have all three vector components.
We further assume that the trail axis is directed at a sufﬁcient
angle to the geomagnetic ﬁeld (in this paper, we restrict the
analytical treatment to the purely orthogonal case). The paper
differs from Jones [17] in that it includes the important effect

2

of the background ionospheric plasma. Finally, we consider
only the case when there is no external electric ﬁelds or strong
neutral winds which often exist in real E-region ionosphere,
especially at high latitudes and in the equatorial region. We
will describe these important effects in future papers. In this
paper, we present results of both numerical simulations and
analytical theory. The main result of this work is a quantitative
description of meteor trail evolution and the polarization elec-
tric ﬁeld associated with its ambipolar diffusion. Results of
our analytical model and simulations agree remarkably well.
We expect that applying our theoretical model to radar echoes
from trails should help researchers obtain useful information
about meteoroids and the surrounding atmosphere.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss
qualitatively the ambipolar diffusion of meteor trails in the
E-region ionosphere, introduce the concept of the residual po-
tential and discuss some restrictions. In Section III, we present
the equations for meteor ﬁelds and diffusion based on a sim-
ple two-ﬂuid model model of a highly collisional isothermal
plasma and formulate proper boundary conditions. In Section
IV we discuss results of our 2D ﬁnite-element simulations,
which give us useful insights into ﬁnding the proper approach
for the analytical treatment of the problem. In Section V, we
present our analytical theory for the speciﬁc case of mutu-
ally orthogonal meteor trail axis and the geomagnetic ﬁeld. In
Section VI, we summarize our analytical results. In Section
VII, we compare our theory with simulations quantitatively.
In Section VIII, we discuss some caveats and implications of
our theory. In Section IX, we give a summary of the paper.
Appendices A to F give mathematical details of our analytical
theory.

II. QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF METEOR TRAIL
DIFFUSION

In this section, we discuss qualitative aspects of the meteor
trail diffusion which will allow us to formulate the problem
and make appropriate simpliﬁcations.

A. Plasma physics conditions in E-region ionosphere

The majority of specular and non-specular radar echoes are
observed in the lower E region at altitudes 90–120 km, where
the neutral atmosphere is many orders of magnitudes denser
than the ionospheric plasma. While the plasma left behind
a fast meteoroid in the form of a diffusing trail can be sev-
eral orders of magnitude denser than the background iono-
spheric plasma, it is usually much less dense than the neu-
tral atmosphere. The neutral atmosphere remains essentially
undisturbed by the plasma trail formation.

All characteristic spatial scales of the diffusion state are
much larger than the Debye length. The typical diffusion
time scale is much longer that the electron plasma period.
Due to these, the quasi-neutrality holds to good accuracy,

and ion diffusion responses to the external electric ﬁeld differ
signiﬁcantly. The response of unmagnetized ions is nearly
isotropic, while the responses of strongly magnetized elec-
trons differ dramatically in the directions parallel and perpen-
dicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The ion isotropic mobility gi
(deﬁned via Vi = giF/e, where F is the external force) is
e/(miνin). The corresponding electron mo-

B. Ambipolar diffusion of plasma columns

At the earliest stage of trail plasma formation, kinetic pro-
cesses associated with ionization of ablated material domi-
nate. After a short time, however, the newly formed plasma
cools down, typical transport velocities become much smaller
than the ion-acoustic speed, and the trail spreads over dis-
tances at least several times the characteristic mean free path
[20]. This can be considered as the beginning of the diffusion
stage. In this paper, we restrict our treatment to this stage.

The meteoroid velocity is usually much higher than typical
diffusion velocities. This means that the trail diffusion starts
roughly simultaneously over a sufﬁciently long distance along
the trail. Considering a part of the trail which is smaller than

the typical variation scale of ionospheric and neutral atmo-
spheric parameters, we will neglect the spatial inhomogene-
ity and assume approximate translational symmetry along the
trail axis, making all variations occur in the plane perpendic-
ular to this axis.

N and the polarization electric ﬁeld E =

Assuming a non-zero angle between the trail axis and the
magnetic ﬁeld, we will consider the diffusion of a 2D plasma
trail with the following geometry, see Fig. 2. The trail density
depends on the x and y coordinates, while it is invariant along
the z coordinate. The homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B0 lies in
the y, z plane. In this geometry, the plasma density gradient
Φ, where Φ is
∇
the electric potential, have only x and y components, while the
electron drift velocity may have all three vector components.
In the special case when the trail axis is strictly parallel to
B0 [9], the ambipolar diffusion is axially symmetric around
the z-axis and its rate, determined by the ratio between the
ion and electron Pedersen mobilities, roughly follows the low-
est mobility. The collision frequencies of both electrons and
ions are proportional to the neutral density which exponen-
tially decreases with increasing altitude. The ratio of the elec-
tron Pedersen mobility to the isotropic ion mobility is given
by the parameter

(2)

At higher altitudes (usually above 97 km at the equatorial re-
gion and above 94 km at high latitudes) where the parameter
ψ is less than unity, the lowest is the electron Pedersen mo-
bility, so that the trail diffusion is determined by the slightly
increased electron Pedersen diffusion rate. At lower altitudes
where ψ > 1, the lowest is the ion mobility, so that the trail
diffusion is determined by the slightly increased ion diffusion
rate.

In the general case, the ambipolar diffusion is more com-
plicated because all components of the polarization electric
ﬁeld are determined by the same scalar potential, Φ. This
means that the diffusion in one direction necessarily affects
the diffusion in other directions. Quasineutrality requires the
divergences of the electron and ion ﬂuxes to be equal, while
the ﬂuxes themselves may differ. Nevertheless, vector com-
ponents of the electron and ion ﬂuxes in any direction usu-
ally remain comparable. For 2D trail diffusion, if the an-
gle between the magnetic ﬁeld and the trail axis is not too

small (see the conditions in Sect. II C), there is a signiﬁ-
cant component of the electron pressure gradient along the
magnetic ﬁeld. Accordingly, there should be a signiﬁcant
component of the polarization electric ﬁeld in this direction,
Φ. The electron mobility along the magnetic ﬁeld
E
k
B0 (the ‘parallel’ mobility) is high, while the electron mobili-
ties in the directions perpendicular to B0 are much lower. The
electron parallel mobility is much greater than that of ions,
5500 (Sect. II A). Because the
ge
k
average ﬂuid velocity of the highly mobile electrons should
be comparable to that of the low-mobile ions, according to
Eq. (1), the parallel component of the polarization electric
ﬁeld should nearly cancel the electron pressure gradient,

Because in our geometry the magnetic ﬁeld direction has a
ﬁnite y component, while the trail and ﬁelds are homoge-
neous along z, Eqs. (3) and (4) show that the residual potential
within and around the trail is essentially independent of the y
coordinate,

The concept of the residual potential φres is crucial for our
numerical and analytical treatment. Furthermore, the macro-
scopic force that drives plasma instabilities is the total force
acting on electrons, which is just proportional to the gradient
of φres.

C. Restrictions on orientation of trail with B

The effective cancelation of the electron pressure along the
magnetic ﬁeld described by Eq. (3) should only occur if the
angle between the meteor trail axis and the magnetic ﬁeld θ is
high enough,

0.8◦. This means
where the critical angle in degrees is Θ0 ≃
that there is a signiﬁcant component of the electric ﬁeld along
B0 to move electrons. The opposite limiting case of θ

corresponds to the diffusion at nearly perfect alignment be-
tween the trail axis and magnetic ﬁeld when no parallel elec-
tron transport exists [10]. However the latter case, as well
as the most difﬁcult for analysis intermediate case, θ
Θ0,
are degenerate cases because of rather small value of the crit-
ical angle Θ0. It is evident that the overwhelming majority

of meteors penetrating the Earth’s atmosphere satisfy the con-
dition given by Eq. (6). We will also require that the elec-
tron Pedersen velocity component along the y remains much
smaller than the corresponding parallel velocity component.

The parameter ψ decreases exponentially with increasing al-
titude, see, e.g., Fig. 2 in Ref. [21]. At the altitude range
where electrons are magnetized while ions are unmagnetized,
roughly between 80 and 120 km, the parameter ψ varies be-
3 and 104, so that restrictions given by Eqs. (7a) and
tween 10−
(7b) combined are stronger than (6). In our major analytical
treatment and simulations, we will discuss the particular case
of θ = 90◦, but in Appendix A, to ﬁnd explicit expressions
for the self-similar solution, we will consider a more general
case restricted only by Eq. (7).

III. DIFFUSION EQUATIONS

If there is no signiﬁcant ionization and recombination dur-
ing the diffusion stage, then the line plasma trail density along
the z axis remains nearly constant. The diffusion stage is ad-
equately described by ﬂuid equations which include two in-
ertialess momentum equations for electrons and ions and two
continuity equations. The quasineutrality condition makes the
Poisson equation for the electric potential unnecessary. This
set of equations can be readily reduced to two coupled non-
linear partial differential equations (PDEs) for the common
plasma density and the electric potential,

IV. SIMULATIONS OF TRAIL DIFFUSION AND FIELDS

In this section, we discuss results of our numerical solu-
tion of Eq. (10) using a ﬁnite-element PDE solver FlexPDE
[31]. The challenge of these simulations is to simultaneously
resolve both the relatively small scale of the trail density vari-
ations and the large scale of the residual potential variations
parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld (along y). This requires the box
size along x to be at least several times the effective trail size
in that direction, σx, while the box size along y should be sev-
0 , i.e., more than two orders of magnitude, larger
eral times Θ−
than the box size along x. FlexPDE uses an adaptive ﬁnite ele-
ments mesh in regions with high gradients to resolve the ﬁelds
and densities with high precision, while uses a coarse mesh in
regions where gradients remain small.

1

We tested the effects of a ﬁnite simulation box on the solu-
tion by varying its size. We also varied boundary conditions,
setting either the density disturbances, ∆n(t)
1, and
φres, or the corresponding ﬂux densities, Eq. (9), to zero on
the boundaries. These tests demonstrated that, for sufﬁciently
large box sizes, the solution in the inner region remained es-
sentially unaffected by the choice of boundary conditions.

In numerical simulations, as well as in the analytical theory
(Sect. V), we have explored the strictly perpendicular case of
θ = 90◦ (µ = 0). In this case, we solved Eq. (10) with Q =
105 and νen/νin = 10,
5500 corresponding to mi/me = 5.5
see Sect. II A. As the initial condition at time t = t0, we chose
a narrow and dense column of plasma, described by the self-
similar solution (SSS). We used normalized units where the
diffusion coefﬁcient D = 1 and the initial time for the SSS
solution t0 = 1, so that the initial spatial distribution of the
total normalized plasma density n = N/N0 was given by

ψ)]1/2 and σy0 = √2, are nearly equal for ψ
1 (lower alti-
tudes), but differ signiﬁcantly for ψ
1 (higher altitudes). To
check the effect of the initial conditions, we tried different ini-
tial Gaussian density distributions corresponding to the same
trail line density. We have found that, after the time needed
for the trail to diffuse over a distance several times the origi-
nal size of the trail, the solution becomes virtually the same.
Hence, it is only weakly sensitive to the actual initial peak
cross-section.

Equation (10b) involves no time derivatives, so that for-
mally φres needs no initial condition. However, the FlexPDE
application requires setting initial conditions for all variables.
In our simulations, we usually set up φres(t0) = 0. We tested
that after a rather short time, the solver automatically sets up
a time-dependent spatial distribution of φres which proves to
be independent of the initial condition for φres.

Bearing in mind the symmetry along the y direction (i.e.,
parallel to B0), we simulated a half of the entire space (y
0)
with boundary conditions at y = 0 given by zero derivatives
of both n and φres. The box size,
|max = 1000, was al-
ways at least two orders of magnitude larger than σy(t), but

we needed to keep it that long because of the long-extended
residual potential.

In order to model different stages of trail diffusion we per-
formed several overlapping runs by varying the initial peak
densities from ∆n0 = 104 to ∆n0 = 10. We usually ﬁnished
each run at t = 40, so that the box size xmax = 30 remained
at least several times σx(t). Because of higher anisotropy and
stronger gradients, the cases of small ψ are much more time
and resource consuming than those of ψ & 1. On a 3GHz
Pentium 4 Windows-based PC, our runs lasted from several
hours (for ψ = 10) to more than a week (for ψ = 0.05). Un-
fortunately, FlexPDE intrinsic restrictions have not allowed us
to simulate ψ < 0.05.

To monitor the accuracy of simulations, we used general
relations for the residual potential outlined in Appendix D
and the exact property of density disturbance integrals (DDIs)
which is analytically derived in Appendix E.

Figure 3 shows typical plasma density and residual poten-
tial plotted over the small fraction of the simulation box near-
est the trail a short time after the simulation begins. Figure 4
compares an example of the trail density contours in the x, y-
plane corresponding to the SSS (a) and to the full simulation
(b) after the trail has diffused to several of its initial radius.
Our simulations have revealed the following major features:

1. Initially, the plasma density distribution within the trail
closely follows the anisotropic (for ψ . 1) SSS. At
a later stage, as the peak density falls, the trail re-
mains nearly Gaussian in each direction but becomes
more isotropic than does the SSS, see Fig. 4, and it
diffuses faster, with the isotropic ambipolar diffusion
rate given described by Eq. (11). The transition from
anisotropic to nearly isotropic diffusion usually takes
place while the peak density remains much larger than

near-trail region, the density has exponentially strong variation along
y, while the residual potential varies only within several percent of its
maximum absolute value. At some point beyond the trail (here about
y = −10), the potential acquires a noticeable y-derivative (electric
ﬁeld parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld B0). This derivative is always
much less than the typical x-derivative (electric ﬁeld perpendicular
to B0).

2. The residual electric potential spreads along y well be-
yond the trail, see Fig. 5, with spatial gradients along
y much less than those along x. Along x it has a non-
monotonic symmetric structure with a deep minimum
at the trail center and two symmetric maxima around it,
as shown in Fig. 3(b). At the later stage, when the trail
diffusion becomes nearly isotropic (see Feature 1), the
residual electric ﬁeld becomes much smaller than that

tially disturb the density as shown in Fig. 6. The ﬁeld
evacuates plasma from the region that maps along B0
the potential minimum back to those about the potential
maxima. As a result, the perturbation density evolves
in antiphase to the potential distribution along with a
maximum at x = 0 and two symmetric minima roughly
at x where the residual potential has the two maxima,
as visible on the edge of Fig. 3(a). In our simulations,
the maximum central density compression more than
doubled the undisturbed background density, while the
depletions reached about 80% of that. These strong dis-
turbances were reached near the trail when the peak trail
density was at least several orders of magnitude larger
than the background density, see Fig. 6.
In all other
cases or locations, relative density disturbances were
small. We estimate them in Sect. V D.

We will discuss these features in Sects. V and VII, when
describing our analytical theory and comparing it with simu-
lations. Here we only give brief explanations to some features.

Feature 1: At the later stage of trail diffusion, when the
initially dense trail density becomes much less dense (but re-
mains much denser than the background plasma), its gradual
isotropization and acceleration of diffusion to the ambipolar
isotropic rate are due to the sharp decrease with time in the
residual electric ﬁeld (Feature 2). In this case, the total force
acting on electrons becomes so small that diffusion is mainly
determined by the total pressure gradient acting on ions and,
hence, is virtually unaffected by the external magnetic ﬁeld.
The signiﬁcant reduction of the residual electric ﬁeld is due to
the response of the background plasma which is not included
in the SSS. To provide quasineutrality, a less dense trail starts
attracting more charged particles from the background, thus
reducing the need for strong ambipolar electric ﬁeld.

Feature 2: The extension of the residual potential along
y, i.e., parallel to the external magnetic ﬁeld B0, is due to
the high electron mobility along B0. The deep potential min-
imum in the trail center is formed by anisotropic ambipolar
trail diffusion. These two factors are included in the SSS and
are independent of the existence of background plasma. How-
ever, the two maxima seen in the residual potential distribution
along x, see Fig. 3(b), are due to background plasma. The
electron and ion ﬂuxes originating in the trail extend into the
background ionosphere with sharply anisotropic and quite dif-
ferent patterns, while the divergences of the two ﬂuxes remain
balanced. Beyond the trail, these patterns have a quadrupole-
like structures providing current closure. To drive the return
currents, the background ionosphere develops potential gradi-
ents which oppose those within the trail, i.e., those responsible
for the trail diffusion. This gives rise to the two symmetric po-
tential bumps around the deep potential minimum and draws
background plasma into the trail edges.

3. Beyond the trail, where the exponentially small trail
density is much less than the background density, the
residual electric ﬁeld extending along B0 may substan-

The simulations allow us to determine diffusion rates and
isotropy for a range of altitude-dependent ψ. This will be pre-
sented in conjunction with our analytical theory in Sect. VII.

V. ANALYTICAL THEORY

Here we discuss our analytical theory for the ‘perpendicu-
lar’ case of θ = 90◦ (µ = 0), when a double mirror symmetry,

takes place. The Hall velocity of electrons is directed strictly
along the trail axis, so that it does not affect the 2D diffusion
of the plasma trail. In the general case of θ
= 90◦, the Hall
mobility breaks the double mirror symmetry but keeps a rota-
tional (by 180◦) symmetry around the trail axis, Eq. (17). For
sufﬁciently large angles θ, distortions caused by the Hall mo-
bility are relatively small (see Appendix A), so that the double
mirror symmetry roughly takes place. However, the Hall mo-
bility affects the aspect ratio of typical scales along each axis.
We reserve the more general case for future work.

The trail diffusion and evolution of the ambipolar ﬁelds are
described by two coupled nonlinear PDEs for the plasma den-
sity and the residual potential, see Eqs. (10) or (15). Our the-
ory provides an approximate analytical solution of both inter-
related problems. The key point of the theory has been the
inclusion of the background plasma into consideration. In so
doing, even for µ = 0, one cannot ﬁnd the exact analytical
solution of the coupled equations. However, based on the ex-
istence of the large parameter Q = Θ−
5500, Eq. (12),
and on the insight from our simulations, see Sect. IV, we have
developed an approximate approach based on the perturbation
technique.

2
0 ≃

We have used the fact that the initially narrow and dense
trail keeps nearly Gaussian density distribution during the trail
lifetime even if the diffusion rate is changing with time, see
Sect. IV. Given the characteristic scale of the Gaussian dis-
tribution, we have reduced Eq. (15b) to a simpler equation
for the residual potential. This one-dimensional (1D) linear
integrodifferential equation is the governing equation of our
theory. It has two equivalent forms that depend upon only one
dimensionless parameter ρ. This master parameter is propor-
tional to the the square of the characteristic Gaussian scale
σ2
x(t), see Eq. (65) below, and, hence, monoton-
along x, ρ
ically grows with time. Approximate solutions of the govern-
ing equation in different domains of ρ(t) have allowed us to
obtain the spatial distribution of the residual electric potential
in the entire 2D space.

∝

The trail diffusion is mainly determined by the parabolic
behavior of the potential along x within the central region and
is practically insensitive to the potential behavior outside this
region. This has allowed us to ﬁnd from Eq. (15a) the ex-
plicit time dependence of ρ(t) and thus close the solution. As
a result, we have obtained approximate analytic expressions
describing the trail diffusion and the evolution of the residual
electric ﬁelds. These expressions reasonably well agree with
the numerical results and can be used for quantitative predic-
tions.

basic ideas and discuss the resultant governing equation. We

A. Governing equation for near-zone residual potential

Here we brieﬂy describe the governing equation intended
for the solution of the residual potential problem. Given the
trail density spatial distribution, this approximate equation is
derived from Eq. (15b). The derivation requires separation of
the entire ξ, ζ plane into two overlapping regions: the near
zone,

y

ζ
|

| ≡

and the far zone,

| ≫
We emphasize that the terms ‘near’ and ‘far’ pertain to the
coordinate ζ only, so that the near zone includes the entire ξ-
axis (the x-axis). The residual potential in the near zone is ξ
dependent but remains nearly constant in the ζ direction, i.e.,
along B0, see Eq. (5), making its calculation a 1D problem.

In the far zone, which includes the background ionosphere
only, the residual potential has a slow ζ dependence, but we
may roughly neglect there density disturbances (see Appendix
B and Sect. V D). The fact that divergences of the electron and
ion ﬂuxes are nearly equal, as required by quasi-neutrality,
results in the Laplace equation in terms of some renormal-
ized coordinates. In those renormalized coordinates, the en-
tire near zone reduces to a thin cut which provides boundary
conditions for the Laplace equation in each of the two half-
spaces, ζ > 0 or ζ < 0. Because of the symmetry, it is sufﬁ-
cient to consider only one of these half-spaces (ζ > 0). Given
the residual potential in the near zone φ0
res, a straightforward
solution of the Laplace equation in integral form yields the
spatial distribution of the residual potential in the entire 2D
space, as described by Eq. (B4).

Eqs. (23a,b) depending upon the convenience for the speciﬁc
analysis. In Section D, we discuss the general analytical prop-
erties of the solution, which can be used for monitoring the
solution. In particular, under assumed approximations, the in-

mathematically the non-monotonic, two-bump structure of the
residual potential in the near zone observed in our numerical

zone create a feedback to the near zone. The non-monotonic
structure of the residual potential (in each of the two half-
spaces, x > 0 and x < 0), can be explained as follows. The
total force acting on negatively charged electrons is propor-
φ0
tional to e
res. Within the major trail, this force via elec-
tron Pedersen diffusion pushes electrons outwards. This re-
quires the residual potential to have a minimum in the trail
center. Well beyond the trail, different electron and ion ﬂux
patterns form return ﬂuxes in the background ionosphere. On
approaching the trail, these ﬂuxes are directed inwards which
requires oppositely directed gradients of the residual potential.
This gives rise to the two bumps of the residual potential.

B. Solution of governing equation

Having solved equations for the residual potential in the
near zone and using formulas of Appendix B, we can ﬁnd the
ambipolar electric ﬁeld and estimate the plasma density dis-
turbances both in the trail and in the background ionosphere.
Equivalent Eqs. (23a,b) have singular Cauchy kernels. While
general methods for solving singular integral equations exist
[22, 23], we are unaware of such methods for Cauchy-type
integrodifferential equations. Even the existence and unique-
ness of the solutions of such equations is not a priori known
and should be studied individually for each speciﬁc equation.
Nevertheless, for each value of ρ, Eq. (23) has the unique so-
lution. We will not dwell here on the proof, but note that the
uniqueness of the solution is provided by the positive sign of
ρ [for negative ρ, Eq. (23) would have inﬁnite number of so-
lutions].

While the equation for ϕ(η) has the unique solution, it is
not possible to ﬁnd it analytically in the general case. In this
section, we discuss approximate solutions of Eq. (23) for var-
ious ranges of ρ. We will proceed from the simplest case to
the more complicated ones.

1. Late stage diffusion, ρ ≫ 1

≫

The simplest limiting case of ρ

1 corresponds to a
sufﬁciently late stage of the meteor trail diffusion, when the
peak trail density exceeds the background not too signiﬁ-
ψ1/2/[2(1 + ψ)Θ0] (ψ1/2/Θ0 =
cantly, (Nmax −
1). In this limiting case, one can solve Eq. (23b)
νin/Ωi ≫
using a perturbation technique. For ρ
1, the integral term
in Eq. (23b) is small compared to the ﬁrst term in the RHS. To
the zeroth order, we can neglect the integral term so that the
zero-order solution is given by ϕ(η)

the electric ﬁeld, ∂ηϕ
≈
that for the self-similar solution, ∂ηϕSS = η2/2.

The physical reason for much smaller residual electric ﬁeld
is as follows. When electrons leave a sufﬁciently dense trail,
mainly along the magnetic ﬁeld, slowly diffusing ions create
a signiﬁcant ambipolar electric ﬁeld to retard electrons. If the
trail is not dense then there are enough background electrons
to substitute for those leaving the trail, so that no strong resid-
ual electric ﬁeld is needed. The integral term in Eq. (23b),
corresponding to the term ∂ηϕ in Eq. (23a), describes the elec-
tric ﬁeld associated with the trail electrons, while the remain-
ing terms in the left-hand sides (LHSs) include the effect of
background electrons. In the case of ρ
1, the latter terms
dominate.

≫

To verify that the neglected integral term is really small, we
need to obtain the next-order approximation. To this end, we
substitute the zeroth-order expression ϕ(0)(η) to the integral
term in Eq. (23b). Using Eqs. (C22)–(C24), we obtain the
ﬁrst-order approximation,

imate counterpart ˜J(η) = lS(pη). The two functions prac-
tically perfectly agree everywhere except the two symmetric
maxima. While the approximate expression in the RHS of
Eq. (28) is less accurate, it is much simpler for analysis. Equa-
tion (28) clearly shows that since the second term is small
compared to the ﬁrst one the perturbation approach employed
here is consistent.

≫

As seen from Eq. (28), for ρ

1 the residual potential is
approximately a linear combination of two S-functions with
different arguments. The function S(η) has major qualita-
tive properties of the residual potential shown in Fig. 3(b).
One can also check that this function automatically satis-
ﬁes the general analytical properties of the solution given by
Eqs. (D1), (D4), and (D7).

1, and especially for ρ

The perturbation technique of the previous subsection fails
for ρ
1. In these cases, we have
found no rigorous analytical solution. However, we have de-
veloped an approximate approach for solving the integrodif-
ferential equations using analytical ﬁtting with iterations. This
approach is similar to the numerical shooting method. Assum-
ing a reasonable initial approximation for a zero-order itera-
ϕ(0)(η) with adjustable parameters, we may put
tion ϕ(η)
this function into the integral term of one of the integrodiffer-
ential equations and ﬁnd the next-order iteration. Comparison
between the two iterations at the critical central region allows
us to adjust the parameters in order to ﬁnd the best ﬁt.

≃

The two forms of the integrodifferential equation for the
near-zone potential, Eqs. (23a,b), are equivalent in rigorous
mathematical sense, but this is not so if we seek the trial-
and-error approximate solutions. For the intermediate case
of ρ
1, it is more convenient to use Eq. (23b). This allows
us to disregard the correct asymptotic behavior, Eq. (D4), of
the initial trial function [this behavior is required in Eq. (23a)
to eliminate the diverging effect of the exponentially growing
factor in front of the integral].

∼

We start by choosing a simple trial function, ϕ(0)(η), which
satisﬁes the condition (D1) but not necessarily (D4). Putting
it into the integrodifferential term in Eq. (23b), we calculate
the ﬁrst-order iteration,

It can be readily shown that ϕ(1)(η) will automatically sat-
isfy Eqs. (D1) and (D4).
In principle, the same procedure
could be continued further to calculate next-order approxima-
tions ϕ(2)(η), ϕ(3)(η), but because of increasing complexity
the analytical calculation of the integrals is hardly possible.

To make calculations simpler, we choose as the initial

The major residual potential is located in the central region,
where it is nearly parabolic.
It is natural then to ﬁt the
parabolic behavior of the two functions, ϕ(0)(0) and ϕ(1), at

However, we can determine the asymptotic behavior of A(ρ)

For large ρ, the ﬁrst-order solution ϕ(1)(η) matches the cor-
responding solution obtained in the previous subsection. In-

of Eq. (31) approximately agrees with the second term in
Eq. (28) with the largest mismatch near the two maxima of

ter. Furthermore, because this is the mismatch between the
two minor terms, the relative mismatch between the two full
solutions ϕ(1)(η), Eqs. (28) and (31), is ρ times smaller.

Figure 9 shows the ﬁtting solution for ρ = 1 and ρ = 0.1
and the parabolic SSS for the residual potential, ϕss(η) =
ϕ(0) + η2/2. From Fig. 9(a) we see that for ρ = 1 the two
approximations, ϕ(0)(η) and ϕ(1)(η), are reasonably close to
each other in the entire central region, but the self-similar so-
lution deviates signiﬁcantly from both. Figure 9(b) shows that
for small ρ the two approximations start deviating from each
other even in the central region. The reason for this is that
η2 in the Taylor expansion for
the lowest parabolic term
∝
η4
ϕ(1)(η) becomes so small that the higher-order terms
start playing the major role, even at sufﬁciently small η. At
the same time, the ﬁrst-order approximation ϕ(1)(η) closely
approaches the self-similar solution in the central region, as is
should for small ρ (see the following Section).

This case is the most difﬁcult case for the analysis. Being un-
able to obtain a rigorous solution in the entire range of ϕ (η),
we can construct a reasonable approximation. Qualitatively,
the solution has the same basic form as for ρ & 1, viz., a
deep potential minimum surrounded by two symmetric max-
ima. Smallness of ρ suggests neglecting the integral term in
the RHS of Eq. (23a), so that we obtain the approximate ex-

However, this is only valid within a restricted range of η,

tential, where the parabolically growing potential of the major
trail starts transforming to a decreasing potential beyond the
trail.

The parameter η0 is of major interest for us because it de-
termines the rough boundary for the parabolic potential and
hence for the maximum residual electric ﬁeld responsible for
the electron drift. Because the above heuristic estimate for
η0 was based on a simple order-of-magnitude comparison, we
need a more accurate and consistent estimate. We will con-
struct a piece-wise approximation for ϕ(η), which would be
close to the self-similar approximation given by Eq. (35) at

The small residual electric ﬁeld in the y direction (i.e., along
B0) practically does not affect the SSS, σ2
y = 2Dt, because
the parallel residual electric ﬁeld is small, so that the diffu-
sion along B0 is determined by the isotropic diffusion rate
D, Eq. (11). At the same time, the strong residual electric
ﬁeld along x affects the diffusion in this direction, especially
at altitudes above 93-97 (ψ . 1). The deviation of the char-
acteristic trail size from that determined by isotropic diffusion
is described in Eq. (49) by the coefﬁcient

Nlin/N0 is the trail line density along the axis z

sian proﬁle can be used as a reasonable initial condition for

The coefﬁcient q(t) slowly grows with time as the trail dif-
fuses faster than it does in the SSS. As the electric ﬁeld falls
well below that predicted by the SSS (see Sec. V B), the dif-
fusion becomes nearly isotropic, q(t)

two directions roughly by the same isotropic diffusion rate D.

The coefﬁcient q(t) is determined by the residual electric

Unlike Eq. (A6), however, the coefﬁcient Bxx in Eq. (54) is
no longer a constant but changes with time. Our simulations
show that the central region described by the nearly parabolic
ξ-dependence is broad enough to include the entire trail peak.
It is the parabolic behavior of the potential that imposes the
Gaussian shape of the trail.

These solutions are expressed in terms of renormalized vari-
ables ϕ and η deﬁned by Eqs. (24). In these variables, the

In the course of the trail diffusion, when the parameter ρ be-

explicit expression for F (ρ) = (1/η)(dϕ/dη), we will use
the solutions found in see Sect. V B. While we have no sim-

D. Density disturbances beyond the trail

The residual electric potential originated within the trail and
extended along the magnetic density creates disturbances in
the background plasma, as we observed in our numerical cal-
culations, see Sect. IV, Feature 3. These density disturbances
occur due to the fact that the extended residual potential at-
tracts ions from the surrounding ionosphere into the central
part with the deep potential minimum around x = 0. This
results in plasma compression in the central potential mini-
mum and depletion in the adjacent regions where the residual
potential has two symmetric maxima.

In this section, we will estimate density disturbances in the
background plasma beyond the trail. One motivation for this
is that when obtaining the equation for the residual potential
in the near zone, Eq. (23), we have completely neglected these
disturbances. This has allowed us to reduce the equation for
the residual potential in the far region to the Laplace equation
in renormalized coordinates, see Eq. (B1) in Appendix B. To
estimate the effect of density disturbances, we will consider
the strongest case of dense trail described in Sect. V B 3. An-
other motivation is to ﬁnd a proper adjustment for the parame-
ter ρ, which is needed for the residual potential at sufﬁciently
large state of trail diffusion.

Strongest case, ρ ≪ 1: justiﬁcation of analytical approach

1.

To justify the neglect of density disturbances beyond the
trail, see Appendix B, we will make a simple analytical esti-
mate of density disturbances beyond the trail. The largest dis-
turbances beyond the trail occur in the near zone in the early
stage of dense-trail diffusion, ρ

Given the spatial distribution of the residual potential

Eq. (10a). If we assumed a stationary regime, ∂tn = 0, then

For sufﬁciently small ρ, the parameter η0 depends logarithmi-

1, making the as-

sumption underlying our theoretical approach to be invalid.
Fortunately, our numerical simulations, even in the cases as
strong as nmax = 104, have shown that the background den-
sity disturbances are at worst of order unity in the central near
zone and are much less beyond it, as described in Sect. IV.
The physical reason for this is that the trail diffusion is a non-
stationary process with a diffusion prehistory. Plasma den-
sity disturbances caused by the potential expanding with time
prove to be noticeably smaller than those caused by the sta-
tionary potential.

For a simple estimate of plasma density disturbances out-
side the trail in the non-stationary process, we linearize
Eq. (10a) for relatively small density disturbances, δn =
1. In accord with our theory and simulations,
δN/N0 ≡
we also assume that the major gradients beyond the trail are
perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., are directed mainly
along the x coordinate. As a result, we obtain from Eq. (10a)
a simpler equation,

, the residual electric ﬁeld

This expression shows that general density disturbances are
determined by the entire distribution of the residual electric
ﬁeld over ˜x from all previous times ˜t. It is straightforward to
check that for stationary φres and t
t0, Eq. (69) reduces to
dependence δn(x, t) =
φres(x, t) corresponding to the local
Boltzmann distribution for φres ≪
Before applying a speciﬁc model for ∂˜xφres(˜x, ˜t) we note
the following. When the local coordinate ˜x varies from 0 to
∂˜xφres(˜x, ˜t) changes its sign.

In the central region it draws plasma to the center, while out-
side the central region it repels it. At any previous time ˜t < t,
the local density disturbances are determined by integral con-
tributions from the two competing regions that generally do
not balance each other. In the absence of the exponential fac-
tor in the RHS of Eq. (69), according to Eq. (D2), the two
contributions would exactly compensate each other. The ex-
ponential factor, however, breaks the balance. For example, in
the center, x = 0, the attraction always dominates, so that the
total density disturbance there is positive (plasma compres-
sion). In the adjacent regions, the situation is opposite, so that
the repulsion dominates there, resulting in plasma depletion.
The strongest density disturbances are within the near zone,
where the potential reaches its absolute minimum. For simple
estimate of the potential ϕ in the early stage of trail diffu-

At lower altitudes, ψ & 1, according to Eq. (71), the value

This means that the density disturbances at a given time t be-
come more affected by electric ﬁelds at past time, ˜t < t. In ad-
dition, the ratio I2/I1 becomes smaller, which means that the

disturbances in the near zone are of order unity at worst, see
Fig. 6. In all other situations or locations, such as for ρ & 1,
t0, etc., and especially in the far zone where the major
t
current closure takes place, the density disturbances are much
smaller. This shows that our basic theoretical scheme which
relies on the Laplace equation for the electric potential in the
far zone and neglects density disturbances is a reasonable ap-
proximation.

2. Weakest case, ρ ≫ 1: adjustment of ρ for residual potential

The simulations show that Eq. (63) describes well the evo-
lution of the simulated trail density for all parameters ρ, while
the residual potential solution described in Sect. V B shows a
discrepancy for the late diffusion stage when ρ is large. To
ﬁt the evolution of the simulated potential, the expression for
the master parameter ρ given by Eq. (63) needs an adjustment
˜ρ(t) corresponding to an effective time lag. We argue
ρ(t)
that small background density disturbances beyond the trail
are responsible for this discrepancy.

→

To estimate background plasma density disturbances in the
later stage of trail diffusion, we will use the zeroth-order ap-
proximation for the residual potential given by Eq. (30). In
γt, we have in the near zone

We will use Eq. (75) to reconcile the discrepancy described
above. One of the key factors in the derivation of the govern-
ing equation for the near-zone potential, Eq. (23), has been
the calculation of the density disturbance integral over the ef-
fective ζ-region in the near zone, ∆Nζ1 , as described in Ap-
pendix C. This effective region includes the trail with a nearly
constant ϕres and an adjacent region where a noticeable ζ-
derivative of ϕres builds up, as seen in Fig. 5 at y
10.
This derivative deﬁnes the ﬁelds and current closure structure
in the far zone. The effective integral ∆Nζ1 should include
both the trail density and the disturbances of the background
plasma. The calculation of Appendix C took into account only
the former and completely neglected the latter. For a dense
trail with ρ
1, this proves to be justiﬁed because the rela-
tive contribution of the background plasma disturbances to the
integral proves to be small compared to the contribution of the
trail density. On the contrary, for a much less dense trail with
1, the contribution of background density disturbances
ρ
becomes comparable to that from the trail density.

In Appendix F, we have obtained the effective integral
∆Nζ1 (ξ) and the relation between ˜ρ and ρ in terms of two
coupled parameters of order unity, β(ρ) and ˜β(ρ), Eqs. (F5)
and (F6). Being unable to obtain these parameters analyti-
cally, we have used our simulations for ψ
0.05 to obtain
approximate Eq. (F8). For smaller ψ, we proposed Eq. (F9),
which represents a conjecture and needs a special study.

VI. SUMMARY OF ANALYTICAL RESULTS

In this Section, we summarize our major analytical results
which can be directly applied in comparisons with observa-
tions. To use the theoretical results for practical applications,
we need to pass from the renormalized variables of Sect. V to
the original ones. Where appropriate, we will use simpliﬁed
versions of analytic expressions.

The original residual potential φres(x, y, t) is deﬁned in
Eq. (4). According to Eq. (24), the original residual poten-
tial in the near zone, φ0
φres(x, 0, t), in terms of the
actual coordinate x and time t, is given by

ones in the later diffusion stage. According to Eqs. (62) and

VII. COMPARISON OF THEORY AND SIMULATIONS

≪

In this Section, we compare our analytical theory with sim-
ulations outlined in Sect. IV. We start with comparison of
our simulations with the theoretical expression for the trail
density, Eq. (85). In the early stage of dense-trail diffusion,
1, the nearly Gaussian peak in simulations closely fol-
ρ
lows the self-similar solution (SSS), Eq. (47), though it shows
a slightly faster diffusion, as seen in Fig. 10(a). The density
predicted by Eq. (85) is closer to the SSS curve than to the
numerical one because the interpolation expression for ρ(t)
given by Eq. (63) is less accurate for ρ
1 than it is for
ρ & 1.

≪

∼

When ρ

1, the analytic solution for the density peak
given by Eq. (85) starts deviating from the SSS and becomes
closer to the numerical solution, as illustrated in Fig. 10(b).
When ρ becomes larger, ρ
1, the analytical theory shows
an excellent agreement with simulations, while the SSS pre-
dicts a noticeably slower diffusion, as shown in Figs. 10(c)
and (d).

≫

Figure 11 shows the peak trail densities vs. ρ taken from
the simulations, analytical theory, and self-similar solution.
The numerical solution is shown by separate groups of points
taken from several different runs (each group has its own point
shape). Each run started at t0 = 1 with different values of the
initial peak trail density. In each group, consecutive points
correspond to equidistant moments of time: t = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
The ﬁrst point of the group always lies on the dashed curve
corresponding to Eq. (87) because the SSS was the initial con-
dition for each run. However, starting from t = 2, the nu-
merical points closely approach the theoretical curve given

by Eq. (86), while the SSS solution given by Eq. (87) re-
mains noticeably offset. The theoretical curve overlays the
1 it shows a
numerical points for ρ & 1, while for ρ
slight deviation from the numerical points (see the beginning
of this Section). The transition from an anisotropic diffu-
sion to a more isotropic one occurs near the inﬂection point
about ρ = 1. Notice that this takes place when the trail peak
density remains well above the background plasma density,
∆nmax ∼
Now we compare with simulations the theoretical expres-
sions for the residual potential in the near zone. Figure 12
shows the residual potential along x for the same conditions
as in Fig. 10. Because the parameter ρ spans a broad range of
values from small to large ones we will apply either Eq. (82)
or Eq. (83). Figure 12(a) shows that for ρ
1 the simple
piece-wise approximation agrees reasonably with simulations
in all areas not too close to the two positive bumps of the po-
tential. Indeed, while there is a signiﬁcant difference between
the values of the potential minimum at x = 0, the potential
derivative (the residual electric ﬁeld) is the same in the inner
region characterized by the parabolic dependence and occu-
pied by the trail, see Fig. 10(a). On the other hand, a good
agreement also exists well beyond the trail, where the resid-
ual potential decreases with increasing
and the correspond-
ing electric ﬁeld changes its sign. The zero-order piece-wise
approximation is rough in the transitional zone near the two
potential maxima, where it has a discontinuity in the electric
ﬁeld. The maximum electric ﬁelds in the piece-wise formula
are reached near the discontinuity points, approaching them
from inside. The maximum electric ﬁelds in simulations are
reached at some locations in the inner region closer to the cen-
ter and hence have smaller values. Thus the simple analytical
formula yields nearly correct electric ﬁelds everywhere except
the transitional zones between the inner and outer regions,
where it overestimates the electric ﬁeld magnitude. We have
attempted modeling the transitional electric ﬁeld with higher-
order interpolations to provide a smooth transition, but this
underestimated the ﬁeld. The error for the maximum electric
ﬁeld, however, remains within the range of tens percent for all
our simulations.

For ρ

1, the theoretical expression given by Eq. (83) with
ρ), agrees well with simulations practically
unadjusted ρ ( ˜ρ
in all locations, as seen in Fig. 12(b). As ρ becomes large,
Eq. (83) with unadjusted ρ shows a signiﬁcant discrepancy, as
seen in Fig. 12(c) and (d). However, if we adjust the parameter
˜ρ based on matching of the potential minima for the
ρ, ρ
two solutions and apply Eq. (83) then the discrepancy prac-
tically disappears. It is important that the analytical solution
with only one adjusted parameter ρ
˜ρ causes the theoret-
ical φ0
res to match the numerical solution well not only near
the potential minimum but everywhere. The relation between
ρ and ˜ρ based on our simulations results in the empirical ρ-
dependent adjustment coefﬁcient ˜β, Eqs. (80) and (81). We
emphasize that the adjusted parameter ˜ρ is only needed for
the residual potential and not for the trail density, as described
in Sect. V D.

with the analytical theory.

VIII. DISCUSSION

In this section, we will start by discussing some caveats,
then we will estimate the induction electric ﬁeld in the plasma
trail, and ﬁnally we will dwell on plasma instabilities.

In our theory, we have made a number of assumptions
which are not perfectly valid. Among those were assump-
tions about constant electron and ion temperatures and about
one sort of ions. However, the initially hot temperatures of the
newly produced meteor trail plasma need some time for cool-
ing. Also, this plasma includes material different from the
ambient atmosphere, so that there may be at least two kinds
of ions with different masses. We will include these factors in
future work.

We also note that our full analytical theory has been de-
veloped only for the particular case of a mutually orthogonal

meteor trail axis and magnetic ﬁeld, θ = 90◦. A more general
situation occurs when the angles between the trail axis and
B0, θ, are arbitrary but satisfy restrictions given by Eq. (7).
It is only discussed for the self-similar solution described in
Appendix A. If we ignore the effect of electron Hall currents
into the process of the meteor trail diffusion then we can apply
1,
all our results where according to Eq. (12) the quantity α−
Eq. (B2), and the numerator of ρ, Eq. (25), acquire an addi-
tional factor sin θ. Our preliminary numerical computations
show that the electron Hall current at θ
= 90◦ affects the me-
teor trail diffusion in such a way that the trail density contours
become more isotropic and rotated at a small angle in the x, y
plane, as the SSS does (see Appendix A).

B.

Induction electric ﬁeld

Now we estimate the induction electric ﬁeld associated with
the meteor plasma trail currents and show that, except for
extraordinarily high-density meteors, this ﬁeld is negligible.
This is of importance for the electrostatic ﬁeld approxima-
tion employed in our approach. The induction electric ﬁeld
may only occur due to disturbances of the magnetic ﬁeld, δB,

which in turn are due to the electric current, j, caused by the
plasma trail diffusion. Note that the magnetic ﬁeld distur-
bances, even in spite of their extreme weakness, can be ob-
servable using a sophisticated measurement technique for di-
agnostics purposes. Furthermore, the initial formation of the
trail current may have caused ELF/VLF signals observed on
the ground and correlated with the meteor showers [24, 25].

According to the Maxwell equations, we have

where µ0 is the permeability of free space and we neglected
the displacement current (all characteristic speeds in the trail
diffusion are much less than the speed of light, etc.). The net
electric current is due to the fact that electrons and ions have
different responses to the external force. Being proportional
to the plasma density, the net electric current is mainly con-
centrated within the trail. It is predominantly formed by the
B drift of electrons. In the strongest case, the
unbalanced E
trail density behaves roughly in accord with the self-similar
solution, so that for a simple estimate we can use the corre-
sponding expressions for the current given by Eq. (A10). This

C. Dynamics of electric ﬁeld and plasma instabilities

The ambipolar electric ﬁeld associated with trail diffusion
may drive plasma instabilities responsible for observable non-
specular radar echoes. In this Section, we will make simple
estimates of the driving ﬁeld and instability threshold.

The driving ﬁeld is determined by the total external force
acting on electrons, Eres =

the residual potential deﬁned by Eq. (4). Equations (82) to
(84) give approximate analytical expressions for the residual
potential if the magnetic ﬁeld and the meteor trail axis are mu-
tually orthogonal. These expressions depend upon the dimen-
sionless parameter ρ(t) given by Eq. (79) in terms of the ef-
fective rate γ, Eq. (26). The latter parameter is proportional to

sion process becomes more isotropic and the residual poten-
tial decreases drastically. The critical time tcr varies depend-
ing upon the ionospheric conditions and meteor parameters.
Nighttime conditions with low N0 and given Nlin are equiva-
lent to daytime conditions with much larger N0 and the pro-
portionally increased column line density Nlin. For example,

curve 4 is for Nlin = 1015m−1. Curves 1, 2, 3, and 4 correspond to σeﬀ = 103, 104, 105, and 106m2, respectively.

Because ρ(t) monotonically increases with time, see Eq. (63),
then at some moment, t = tFB, the two sides of Eq. (93)
become equal. At this moment, the linear growth of the FB
instability starts being replaced by linear damping and irregu-
larities will diffuse away. At t < tFB, the linear FB instability
sustain plasma turbulence at a certain level, while at t > tFB
there is no more free energy to sustain the turbulence, so that
irregularities will quickly disappear.

The instability duration tFB depends critically upon the al-
titudinal parameter ψ and the effective trail-background inter-
Nlin/N0. Due to this, the night-
action cross-section σeﬀ ≡
time conditions with low N0 will produce longer lived meteor
trail than will the daytime conditions. Figure 13 shows the
altitude dependence of the instability duration tFB for several
constant σeﬀ during daytime and nighttime conditions. Notice
clear peaks of tFB at some intermediate altitudes which in-
crease with σeﬀ . The non-specular echo boundary for a given
trail, like that in Fig. 1, should roughly follow the altitude de-
pendence of tFB. However, because column plasma density
varies along the meteor trail and due to other inhomogeneities,
we expect more variability than this model predicts. Mea-
surements of the evolution of the trail echoes, in combination
with other observations, should enable us to retrieve useful
information about meteors, ionosphere and atmosphere. Im-
plementation of this procedure requires better models of in-
stability generation than that used above, as well as models
of ablation and ionization to give improved estimates of Nlin
[8, 12].

IX. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have described analytical theory and ﬁnite-
element simulations of trail diffusion and ﬁelds for the mutu-
ally orthogonal trail axis and magnetic ﬁeld. Unlike previous
models, this theory includes both the trail and the background
ionospheric plasma. This has two major effects: (1) a natural

restriction on the ambipolar electric ﬁeld that otherwise would
inﬁnitely grow with distance from the trail and (2) a later-stage
1) diffusion to
transition from sharply anisotropic (for ψ
nearly isotropic one. The former is important for plasma in-
stabilities responsible for non-specular radar echoes, while the
latter is important for interpreting specular radar echoes.

≪

A key element of the present treatment is the introduction
of the residual potential, φres, deﬁned by Eq. (4). Its gradient
describes the total force acting on electrons. Due to high elec-
tron mobility along the magnetic ﬁeld B0, the typical scale of
φres spatial variations in this directions are much larger than
that in the perpendicular direction, while the typical scales of
trail density variations in both directions are comparable. This
fact, which had not been realized in earlier simulations of me-
teor trail diffusion, requires setting the simulation box bound-
ary along B0 far from the trail boundary and simultaneously
resolving the two different scales parallel to B0. In our sim-
ulations, we have overcome the computational difﬁculties by
employing a ﬁnite-element software FlexPDE with the adap-
tive cell structure.

Based on the insight from simulations and using the large
ratio of the electron and ion mobilities along the magnetic
ﬁeld, we have developed an approximate analytical approach.
In this approach, the problems of trail diffusion and of spa-
tial distribution of the residual potential are treated separately,
while the coupling between the two is made via parameters
and approximate solutions. In particular, Gaussian approxi-
mation of the trail peak has allowed us to to treat the resid-
ual potential in terms of one parameter ρ. This parameter
is proportional to the square of the trail peak dispersion, as
described by Eq. (25), and monotonically grows with time.
Due to high electron mobility along the magnetic ﬁeld, the to-
tal force acting on electrons in this direction is much smaller
than the corresponding components in other directions. For
the particular case of mutually orthogonal trail axis and the
magnetic ﬁeld, this has allowed us to reduce the original 2D
description to a 1D linear integrodifferential equation given

in two different forms by Eq. (23). This governing equation
is for a residual potential in the near-trail zone and it has a
unique solution depending upon ρ. The approximate solu-
tion of Eq. (23) depends on the range of ρ, as described in
Sect. V B. Using this solution, we have obtained the approx-
imate expression for ρ(t), Eq. (63), which closes the entire
description of trail diffusion and ﬁelds. Note that the near-
trail potential, which is easily spread along the magnetic ﬁeld,
may create signiﬁcant disturbances of the background plasma
beyond the trail, as described in Sect. V D.

Comparison of analytical theory with simulations have
demonstrated good agreement between the results with one
exception. At a later stage of trail diffusion, the parameter ρ
for the residual potential should be replaced by an adjusted pa-
rameter ˜ρ as described in Sect. VII. We have identiﬁed the na-
ture of this deviation analytically in terms of the disturbances
of the background plasma, but to quantitatively relate ˜ρ and ρ
we have invoked simulations.

The analytical theory and simulations have allowed us to
estimate the spatial distribution of the ambipolar electric ﬁeld
within and near the plasma trail. These ﬁelds are crucial for
plasma instabilities responsible for generation of ﬁeld-aligned
electron density irregularities observed by high-power large-
aperture (HPLA) radars as non-specular echoes. Measuring
the characteristics of non-specular echoes and some other
characteristics should allow one to retrieve an important in-
formation on the meteoroids and the surrounding atmosphere.

constant density and the residual potential form ellipses in the

we consider ζ′ > 0 as a complex half-plane and introduce a
complex potential,

Ψ (Z) = φres(ξ, ζ′) + iW (ξ, ζ′) ,

(B7)

where the function W (ξ, ζ) also satisﬁes Laplace Eq. (B1).
This is an analytic function of the complex coordinate Z with

that potential disturbances have typical scales of order unity

inﬁnitesimal offsets from zero to either positive or negative
directions. Because of the mirror symmetry with respect to

APPENDIX E: DENSITY DISTURBANCE INTEGRALS

In this Appendix, we derive an important exact property of
density disturbance integrals (DDIs), which have been applied
for monitoring the simulation accuracy, see Sect. IV and VII.
We deﬁne the two DDIs by integrating parallel and perpendic-
ular to B0,

∆Nζ(ξ, t) =

∆n(ξ, ζ, t)dζ,

(E1a)

∆Nξ(ζ, t) =

∆n(ξ, ζ, t)dξ,

where ∆n include both the plasma trail density and distur-
bances of the background plasma. If we solve Eq. (15) with
the self-similar solution (SSS) as the initial condition then the
DDIs multiplied by t, for all coordinates ζ or ξ, are strictly
conserved and equal to those for the SSS, even though the
SSS is, in general, invalid.

To prove this and obtain the explicit analytical expressions
for the DDIs, we start from Eqs. (C1a,b). Adding them, we
eliminate ξ-derivatives of φres,

1, the difference between ∆NTrail and ∆N

In this Appendix, we calculate the effective integral over
near zone, as discussed in Sect. V D 2.

sity is the major contribution to the integral over the effec-
∆NTrail(ξ), where ∆NTrail(ξ) =

tend the integral over ζ to the entire half-axis 0 < ζ <

then we will include the entire background plasma distur-
bances along this half-axis and obtain ∆N
= ∆Nζ/2(ξ) =
ξ2/4q0), where ∆Nζ is the density dis-

icant. The two integrals, however, are both Gaussian functions
of ξ with peaks at ξ = 0. Their integrals over the entire ξ-
axis, i.e., the 2D integrals of the trail density and the total den-
sity disturbances over the entire half-space ζ > 0, are equal,
dξ = 2π√q0(n0t0/t). The

The reason why the integral over ξ should be the same is that
at any ζ beyond the trail the corresponding integral of the
background density disturbances along ξ, Eq. (E5b), is ex-
ponentially small, as conﬁrmed by our simulations.

The parameter ˜q(t) is similar to q in NTrail and is uniquely
related to the peak value ∆Nζ1 (0). From the derivation of
Appendix C, it is clear that the adjusted parameter ˜ρ is related
to ˜q by the same relation as ρ to q, Eq. (25), i.e., ˜ρ = γ ˜qt.
Thus to ﬁnd ˜ρ, we need to estimate ∆Nζ1 (0),

The part of the corresponding integral stemming from the trail
density is determined by q or by ρ = γqt. To ﬁnd the ad-
ditional part stemming from the background density distur-
bances, we use Eq. (75), where we should replace ρ by ˜ρ be-
cause these disturbances are determined by the residual poten-
tial. While the constant value of δn = 1/1(1 + ψ)˜ρ is easy
to integrate, it is not so easy to determine the upper limit of
integration, i.e., the exact value of ζ1.

It is clear, however, that ζ1 should lie within the near zone,
Eq. (20), so that ζ1 = β/α, where α = (1 + ψ)1/2Θ0,

Eq. (B2), determines the typical scale (
ual potential variation along ζ and β is a numerical factor of
order unity or less. Adding the two contributions and using

If we start from small values of ρ, as assumed by our theory,
then we have to choose the solution with the ‘plus’ sign in
front of the square root corresponding to ˜ρ
0.
In this case, the ratio ˜ρ/ρ decreases with increasing ˜β, so that
˜ρ cannot be less than ρ/4. In our simulations, however, we
found cases when, at least for some time, ˜ρ followed Eq. (F6)
with the ‘minus’ sign in front of the square root, so that ˜ρ
was less than ρ/4. These special cases (ψ = 0.05, ∆n0 .
50) usually start from sufﬁciently large values of ρ which are
beyond the assumptions of our analytic theory.

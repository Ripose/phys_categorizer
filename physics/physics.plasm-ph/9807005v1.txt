The inﬂuence of a constant uniform magnetic ﬁeld on the thermodynamic properties of a partially
ionized hydrogen plasma is studied. Using the method of Green’s function various interaction
contributions to the thermodynamic functions are calculated. The equation of state of a quantum
magnetized plasma is presented within the framework of a low density expansion up to the order
e4 n2 and, additionally, including ladder type contributions via the bound states in the case of strong
magnetic ﬁelds (2.35×105T ≪ B ≤ 2.35×109T ). We show that for high densities (n ≈ 1027−30m−3)
and temperatures T ≈ 105 − 106K typical for the surface of neutron stars nonideality eﬀects as ,e.g.,
Debye screening must be taken into account.

I. INTRODUCTION

The calculation of the equation of state (EOS) of a multi-component quantum plasma consisting of charged particles
interacting via the Coloumb potential is of theoretical interest as well as of practical relevance, e.g., for astrophysical
systems such as stars. The aim of this paper is to derive a low-density expansion for the equation of state (EOS)
of a two-component plasma embedded in an external constant magnetic ﬁeld. This problem was recently tackled by
Cornu [1] and Boose&Perez [2] who derived a formally exact virial expansion of the EOS by using a formalism which
is based on the Feynman-Kac path-integral representation of the grand-canonical potential.

In this paper we will employ the method of Green’s function. As the calculations are carried out for a nonrelativistic

×

quantum system, we restrict ourselves to magnetic ﬁeld strengths B < Brel which is given by Brel = m2
≈
109T .Further we will use an expansion of the magnetized plasma pressure in terms of the fugacity z = eβµ
4.4
to obtain the EOS of a weakly coupled magnetized plasma. Thus we can derive explicit expressions for various
contributions to the quantum second virial coeﬃcient. Though the formalism is formally valid only for low densities
the obtained explicit expressions are appropriate even at suﬃcient high densities as the magnetic ﬁeld increases the
domain of classical behavior towards higher densities. The second virial coeﬃcient contains both scattering and bound
state contributions of two-particle states. Being interested in the thermodynamic properties of quantum magnetized
plasmas the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on the energy eigen states of a two-particle states has to be taken into
account.

ec2/(e¯h)

Usually the magnetic ﬁeld is measured by the dimensionless parameter γ = ¯hωc/(Ry) = B/B0 where ¯hωc is the
13.605eV is the ionization energy of the
electron cyclotron energy, B0 ≈
ﬁeld-free hydrogen atom. Whenever γ > 1, i.e. the cyclotron energy is larger than the typical Coulomb energy, the
structure of the hydrogen atom is dramatically changed. This problem has been approached by several authors [3–6].
Using the results of these authors we study the inﬂuence of bound and scattering states on thermodynamic properties
of magnetized plasmas.

Recently the problem of ionization equilibrium of hydrogen atoms in superstrong magnetic ﬁelds (γ

1) was
considered by Lai&Salpeter [3]. They proposed an ideal Saha equation of a hydrogen gas including bound states but
neglecting screening eﬀects and scattering contributions to the second virial coeﬃcient. Using the EOS obtained in
our derivation we construct a modiﬁed Saha equation which takes into account nonideality eﬀects as well.

≫

The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we discuss the method which is used to calculate thermodynamic
functions and derive analytical results for the scattering contribution in section III. An approximate result for the
bound state contributions is given in section IV and the equation of state is presented in section V. Finally, we use
our results to derive a generalized Saha equation and compare the degree of ionization with the results of the ideal
Saha equation in section VI.

II. FUGACITY EXPANSIONS OF THE THERMODYNAMIC FUNCTIONS

We consider a two-component charge-symmetrical system of N spin half particles of charge (-e) and mass me and
N spin half particles of charge e and mass mi. In general, the total pressure can be split into ideal contributions and
interaction contributions

interacting via the Coulomb potential Vab(r) = eaeb/(4πǫ0 |
) the second virial coeﬃcient deﬁned by Eqs.(4,6)
|
is divergent. In order to obtain a convergent expression one has to perform a screening procedure. Such a technique
is well established in the zero magnetic ﬁeld case [7–9] and can be easily extended to the nonzero magnetic ﬁeld case.
This program was also carried out by Cornu [1] and Boose&Perez [2] who used the Feynman-Kac formalism to derive
a virial expansion for a magnetized multi-component system. Using the methods as described in [7–9] the convergent
second virial coeﬃcient of a plasma may be split into a scattering and bound state contribution. In contrast to the
zero magnetic ﬁeld case an exact calculation of the convergent second virial coeﬃcient in terms of scattering phase
shifts is very complicated. Therefore we will give a perturbation expansion of the scattering part in terms of the
interaction parameter e2 up to the order e4 and use an approximate expression for the bound state part which is valid
in the case of strong magnetic ﬁelds (γ > 100). We may employ the method of Green’s function. The starting point is
by a charging process
the observation that the equation of state is connected to the average interaction energy

In the case of a Coloumb potential this division is not trivial as the atomic partition function is divergent due to the
inﬁnite number of bound states at the continuum boundary. This problem has been extensively discussed in the zero

states

arbitrary but guarantees the convergence of the bound state partition function even at vanishing magnetic ﬁeld. We
mention that this division does not aﬀect the results of the thermodynamic potentials.

These diagrams are the Hartree term, the Montroll-Ward term, the Hartree-Fock term, and the exchange e4 term,
respectively. The solid lines represent the uncorrelated Green’s function for a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld
[11]. Hence our calculations are valid at arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld strength. The divergence of the Montroll-Ward
graph is avoided by introducing a screened potential line. The screened interaction potential V s is evaluated in the
random phase approximation V s(q, ω) = V (q)/(1
V (q) ΠRP A(q, ω)). At low densities V s can be approximated by a
statically screened potential V s = e2/(ǫ0 [q2 +κ2]) with κ2 = (e2/ǫ0) ΠRP A(0, 0) = β (e2/ǫ0) (˜ze + ˜zi). In the following
calculations all results are obtained by setting the distribution function f0(ω) = eβµe−βω, i.e., in the nondegenerate
limit nλ3 tanh(x)/x

1. The Hartree term vanishes due to the electroneutrality.

paper. In contrast to the ﬁeld-free hydrogen atom there is no exact solution for the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom

The chemical potential in Eq.(38) can be eliminated by using the relation

to obtain the equation of state for a magnetized plasma. This procedure has been carried out numerically and the

Eqs.(38,39) describe the ionization equilibrium of a weakly coupled hydrogen plasma in strong magnetic ﬁelds in an
implicite form. The eﬀect of the nonideality (i.e. of the scattering states contribution) of the plasma is to reduce the
pressure. This contribution dominates the bound states contribution at high temperatures while at low temperatures
the bound state term is dominant. Independent of the nonideality of the system we may also characterize the pressure
105K the pressure decreases with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength, while
by the magnetic ﬁeld strength. For T < 6
105K the pressure increases as the magnetic ﬁeld increases. This can be explained by the domination
for T > 6
of the lowering of the ground state energy with increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength at low temperatures, while at high
temperatures the decrease of the phase space volume dominates.

In order to give a more explicit representation of the ionization equilibrium we will derive a generalized Saha

equation in the next section.

In previous treatments of this problem [3,12,13] the interaction between the charged particles has been neglected.
But at high densities considered here interactions between the particles play an important role. Our method is based

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we constructed a theory describing a hydrogen plasma in a constant uniform magnetic ﬁeld. Starting
from a fugacity expansion we derived a general expression for the second virial coeﬃcient as a perturbation expansion
with respect to the interaction parameter e2 and we explicitly calculated the lowest order contributions for the
scattering part and considered bound state contributions at arbitrary order by using the approximate results for the
binding energy of Lai&Salpeter [3]. The results were used to establish the equation of state. Finally, we have derived
a generalized Saha equation and we have shown that at high densities and at temperatures typical for the surface of
neutron stars nonideality eﬀects can signiﬁcantly increase the degree of ionization.

The accuracy of the absolute values of the considered physical quantities can be improved by using more accurate
energy eigenvalues, i.e. better ﬁtting formulas, and by calculating even higher order contributions to the scattering
part of the second virial coeﬃcient. Nevertheless, the inﬂuence of the nonideality eﬀects on the ionization equilibrium
as shown in this paper remains approximately the same.

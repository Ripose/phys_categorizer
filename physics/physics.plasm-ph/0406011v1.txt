Abstract

Two dimensional stochastic time model of scrape-oﬀ layer (SOL) turbulent transport is studied. Insta-

bility arisen in the system with respect to the stochastic perturbations of both either density or vorticity

reveals itself in the strong outward bursts of particle density propagating ballistically across the SOL. The

stability and possible stabilization of the cross-ﬁeld turbulent system depend very much upon the reciprocal

correlation time between density and vorticity ﬂuctuations.

Pdf of the particle ﬂux for the large magnitudes of ﬂux events can be modelled with a simple discrete

time toy model of random walks concluding at a boundary. The spectra of wandering times feature the pdf

of particle ﬂux in the model and qualitatively reproduce the experimental statistics of transport events.

Introduction

Turbulence stabilization in plasma close to the wall blanket of the ITER divertor is the

important technical problem determining the performance of the next step device. Long range

transport in the scrape-oﬀ layer (SOL) provokes the plasma-wall interactions in areas that are

not designed for this purpose. Evidence of the strong outward bursts of particle density prop-

agating ballistically with rather high velocities far beyond the e-folding length in the SOL has

been observed recently in several experiments (see [1]-[3]) and in the numerical simulations [4].

These events do not appear to ﬁt into the standard view of diﬀusive transport: the probability

distribution function (pdf) of the particle ﬂux departs from the Gaussian distribution forming

a long tail which dominates at high positive ﬂux of particles [4].

Theoretical investigations of the reported phenomena remain an important task.

In the

present paper, we consider a variety of two dimensional ﬂuid models based on the interchange

instability in plasma studied in [5]-[6] and discussed recently in [4] exerted to the Gaussian

distributed external random forces to get an insight into the properties of turbulent transport

in the cross-ﬁeld system.

or the vanishing of both with the consequent appearance of a complicated dynamic picture

that is most likely stochastic. The latter case corresponds to a maximally symmetric motion

resulting from the destruction of unperturbed symmetries [7]. In particular, instability in the

system (1) occurs either with respect to any small perturbation of density or vorticity.

Accounting for the dissipation processes in plasma smears the picture, so that the small scale

ﬂuctuations would acquire stability. In the present paper, we demonstrate that the small scales

ﬂuctuations can be stable provided there exist the reciprocal correlations between the stochastic

sources of density and vorticity in the dynamical equations. The large scale stability of a

ﬂuctuation can be characterized by the order parameter ξ =
in the momentum
space where kx and ky are the radial and poloidal components of momenta respectively. For
the uncorrelated random forces (under the white noise assumption), a ﬂuctuation with ξ > 0

is unstable with respect to the large scale asymptote in the stochastic problem.

The accounting for the convection of particles by the random vortexes introduces a ﬁnite

reciprocal correlation time τc(
) between the density and vorticity random forces. Then
there exists the critical scale ξc, in the stochastic model, such that a ﬂuctuation with ξ < ξc
vanishes with time, but its amplitude grows up unboundedly with time, for ξ > ξc.

Correlations between the unstable ﬂuctuations of density at diﬀerent points are described

by the advanced Green’s functions which are trivial for t > 0.

In particular, these func-

tions determine the concentration proﬁle of the unstable ﬂuctuations of density which increases

steeply toward the wall. The size of such ﬂuctuations grows linearly with time. In this case,

the statistics of the transport events responsible for the long tail of the ﬂux pdf is featured

by the distribution of the characteristic wandering times of growing blobs convected by the

highly irregular turbulent ﬂow in the close proximity of the divertor wall. In our model, we

have replaced this complicated dynamics with the one dimensional (the radial symmetry is

implied in the problem) discrete time random walks. Such a discrete time model would have

another interpretation: the advanced Green’s function is a kernel of an integral equation which

relates the amplitudes of the growing ﬂuctuations apart from the wall with those on the wall,

in the stochastic dynamical problem. Indeed, this equation is rather complicated and hardly

allows for a rigorous solution. Therefore, being interested in the qualitative understanding of

statistics of the turbulent transport in the SOL, we develop a Monte Carlo discrete time simu-

lation procedure which would help us to evaluate the asymptotic solutions of the given integral

equation.

General approach to the probability distributions of arrival times in such a discrete time

model has been developed recently in [8].

In general, its statistics can exhibit the multi-

variant asymptotic behavior. Referring the reader to [8] for the details, in the present paper,

we have just shown that the statistics of arrival times for the unstable ﬂuctuations is either

exponential or bounded by the exponentials (in particular, the latter would be true in the case

of the randomly roaming wall) that is in a qualitative agreement with the data of numerical

simulations and experiments [4].

2 Stochastic models of turbulent transport in the cross-ﬁled system.

The stochastic models of cross ﬁeld turbulent transport used in the present paper refers to

the eﬀectively two-dimensional ﬂuid model of plasma based on the interchange instability in the

SOL [5, 6] recently discussed in [4]. In this model, one assumes the temperatures of ions and
Te. Then the problem is reduced to that of two coupled ﬁelds,
electrons to be constant, Ti ≪

the mean normalized particle density. The curvature coeﬃcients gk averaged along the lines

damping in the small scales, herewith u0 is the dimensionless Prandtl number where the knot
distinguishes its value in the free theory from its eﬀective value u in the renormalized theory

(see Sec. 4).

The Gaussian distributed random forces fn and fw in (2) play the role of stochastic sources in
the dynamical problem maintaining the system out of equilibrium and simultaneously modelling

the Bohm’s boundary conditions at the sheath which have not been explicitly included in (2),

in contrast to the original models [4]-[6]. Herewith, the physically important eﬀect of particle

escape at the sheath is replaced with a quenched loss of particles in the SOL at the points
for which fn(x, y, t) < 0. Simultaneously, the particles are supposed to arrive in the SOL
in the areas where fn(x, y, t) > 0 modelling the injection of particles from the divertor core
along with the perturbations risen in the system due to the Langmuir probes [9]-[11]. For a

simplicity, in the present paper, we assume that the processes of gain and loss of particles

are balanced in average therefore

= 0. The stochastic source of particles is used instead

of the continuously acting radial Gaussian shaped source (localized at x = 0) studied in the
numerical simulations [4]. Similarly, we impose the random helicity source fw exerting onto the
vorticity dynamics in (2).

Furthermore, the random sources fn and fw account for the internal noise risen due to the
microscopic degrees of freedom eliminated from the phenomenological equations (2). From the

technical point of view, the random forces help to construct a forthright statistical approach

to the turbulent transport in the SOL. In particular, it allows for the quantum ﬁeld theory

formulation of the stochastic dynamical problem (2) (based on the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR)

formalism [12]) that gives a key for the use of advanced analytical methods of modern critical

phenomena theory [13].

The Gaussian statistics of random forces in (2) is determined by their covariances,

Recent studies reported on the statistics of transport events in the cross-ﬁeld systems [4],[14]

pointed out the virtual importance of correlations existing between density and vorticity ﬂuc-

tuations in the dynamical problem. In particular, this eﬀect is referred to the formation of large

density blobs of particles close to the divertor walls by attracting particles via the cross ﬁeld

ﬂow, the latter being the larger for strong blobs with strong potential gradients [4]. Indeed, in

that the random perturbations enter into the system in a correlated way. To be speciﬁc, let us

random environment with long-range correlations based on the Langevin equation (4) have

been discussed in concern with the problem of anomalous scaling of a passive scalar advected

by the synthetic compressible turbulent ﬂow [18], then in [19], for the purpose of establishing

the time scale separation, in the models of self organized criticality [20]-[22].

4 Functional integral formulation of the stochastic problem. Dimen-

sional analysis, UV divergencies in diagrams and renormalization

In the present section, we study the properties of diagram series resulting from the iterations

of the stochastic dynamical equations with the consequent averaging with respect to all possible

conﬁgurations of random forces. The diagrams for some correlation functions diverge in small

scales. The use of conventional arguments borrowed from the quantum ﬁeld renormalization

group [23] helps to prove the consequent subtraction of the logarithmic divergent terms in all

orders of perturbation theory out from the diagrams.

The set of diagrams arisen in the perturbation theory by the iterations of (2) is equivalent

to the standard Feynman diagrams of some quantum ﬁeld theory with the doubled set of
stochastic ﬁelds: the ﬂuctuations n and w, the ﬂux function v, the auxiliary ﬁelds n′, w′
functionally conjugated to the Gaussian distributed random forces fn and fw in (2), and the
Lagrange multiplier v′ for the binding relation w =
v. The coincidence of diagrams is
a particular consequence of the general equivalence between the t-local stochastic dynamical

problems (in which the interactions contain no time derivatives) and the relevant quantum

ﬁeld theories [24] with the action functional

without the auxiliary ﬁelds Φ′ vanish being proportional to θ(0) and therefore do not require

where u0 and u are the bare and renormalized values of Prandtl’s number. In principle, the rel-

However, the standard approach of the critical phenomena theory is useless for the deter-

mining of the large scale asymptotes in the problem in question, since the severe instability

frustrates the critical behavior in the system preventing its approaching to the formal asymptote

predicted by the conventional renormalization group method. As a consequence, the critical

dimensions of ﬁelds and parameters which can be computed from the renormalization procedure

would have just a formal meaning.

5 Large scale instability of iterative solutions

The iterative solutions for the stochastic problem (2) constructed in Sec. 3 would be asymp-

totically stable in the large scales provided all small perturbations of both density and vorticity

13

damp out with time. In particular, the exact response functions found from the Dyson equations

(13) should have poles located in the lower half-plane of the frequency space.

The stability of free response function

iω + ν k2)−1 which eﬀectively cor-
δn/ δfn i
responds to the linearized problem (10) is ensured in the large scales by the correct sign of the
dissipation term νk2 > 0. In a ”proper” perturbation theory, apart from a crossover region,
the stability of exact response functions is also secured by the dissipation term which dominates

Being interested in the O( ky )-contribution into (19), one can neglect the k

assumption on the covariances of random forces since it changes the free propagator ∆nn. For
( ω2 + ν2p4 )−1, the integral in (19)
instance, under the white noise assumption (3) ∆nn ≃
diverges at the small scales (large momenta) for ε < 1 and diverges at the large scales (small

φ(x) + xV ) that would eradicate those

conﬁgurations with the trivial poloidal component of electric drift vy = 0. In general, the
relevant dispersion equation ω ( k, V ) = 0 could have many solutions Vk for k

the turbulence stabilization is achieved for the drifts V from the intervals Vk−1 < V < Vk for

SOL

Large scale instability developed in the cross-ﬁeld model (2) is related to the appearance and

unbounded growth of ﬂuctuations of particle density close to the wall. In accordance to the

ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem, the ﬂuctuations arisen in the stochastic dynamical system are

related to its dissipative properties. In particular, the matrix of the exact response functions
R( k, ω ) expressing the perturbations of ﬁelds n and w risen due to the random sources fn and
fw determines the matrix of exact dynamical Green’s functions G( k, ω ),

where τ is the travelling time of the density blob to achieve the divertor wall that can be

eﬀectively considered as a random quantity.

It is the distribution of such wandering times

17

that determines the anomalous transport statistics described by the ﬂux pdf in our simpliﬁed

model. The discrete time model we discuss below is similar to the toy model of systems close to

a threshold of instability studied in [8] recently. Despite its obvious simplicity (the convection

of a high density blob of particles by the turbulent ﬂow of the cross ﬁeld system is substituted

by the discrete time one-dimensional (in the radial direction) random walks characterized with

some given distribution function), its exhibits a surprising qualitative similarity to the actual

ﬂux driven anomalous transport events reported in [4].

We specify the random radial coordinate of a growing ﬂuctuation by the real number x

= F (u). It is natural to consider the coordinate of wall R as

x < u

as a random variable distributed over the unit interval with respect to another probability
distribution function (pdf) P
continuous increasing functions satisfying the normalization conditions F ( 0 ) = Q( 0 ) = 0,

∞
Given a ﬁxed real number η

∈

[0, 1], we deﬁne a discrete time random process in the

following way. At time t = 0, the variable x is chosen with respect to pdf F , and R is chosen

with respect to pdf Q. If x < R, the process continues and goes to time t = 1. Otherwise,

provided x

R, the process is eliminated. At time t

with pdf Q.

1. Otherwise,

η, the random variable x is chosen with pdf F , and R is chosen

If x

R, the process ends; if x < R, the process continues and goes to time t + 1.

≥

Eventually, at some time step τ, when the coordinate of the blob, x, drops ”beyond” R, the

process stops, and the integer value τ resulted from such a random process limits the duration

of convectional phase. The new blob then arises within the domain, and the simulation process

starts again.

While studying the above model, we are interested in the distribution of durations of con-
vection phases Pη(τ ; F, Q) (denoted as P (τ ) in the what following) provided the probability
distributions F and Q are known, and the control parameter η is ﬁxed. The motionless wall

corresponds to η = 0. Alternatively, the position of wall is randomly changed at each time step

where ˆp(s), ˆq(s), ˆr(s) are the generating functions corresponding to p(l), q(l), r(l), respectively.

In the marginal cases η = 0 and η = 1, the probability P (τ ) can be readily calculated,

Pη=0(τ ) = K(1)τ δK(0), Pη=1(τ ) = δK(τ ).

(34)

The above equation shows that in the case of η = 0, for any choice of the pdf F and Q, the
probability P (τ ) decays exponentially. In the opposite case η = 1, many diﬀerent types of

behavior are possible, depending upon the particular choice of F and Q.

To estimate the upper and lower bounds for P (τ ) for any η, one can use the fact that

Furthermore, the bounds (35) and (36) turns into exact equalities, in the marginal cases η = 0

8 Conclusion

In the present paper, we have considered the stochastic model of turbulent transport in

the SOL of tokamak. This problem allows for the concurrent symmetries, and the system

exhibits a sever instability with respect to both perturbations either particle density or vorticity.

Instability would reveal itself in the appearance of high density blobs of particles hitting into

the reactor wall.

The accounting for the dissipation processes introduces the order parameter ξ =

x + k2
k2
y
and its critical value ξc such that the particle density ﬂuctuation δn(ξ) grows unboundedly with
time as ξ > ξc and damps out otherwise. In the present paper, we compute the value of ξc,
in the ﬁrst order of perturbation theory developed with respect to the small parameter ρs / R¯n
where ρs is the Larmor radius, R is the major radius of torus, and ¯n is the mean normalized
density of particles.

Our results demonstrate convincingly that the possible correlations between density and
vorticity ﬂuctuations would drastically change the value ξc modifying the stability of model.
Characterizing the possible reciprocal correlations between the density and vorticity ﬂuctua-
tions by the speciﬁc correlation time τc, we demonstrate that any ﬂuctuation of particle density
grows up with time in the large scale limit (k
(the density and vorticity
ﬂuctuations are uncorrelated) and therefore ξc = 0. Alternatively, ξc > 0 provided τc <

0) as τc → ∞

The reciprocal correlations between the ﬂuctuations in the divertor is of vital importance

for a possibility to stabilize the turbulent cross ﬁeld system, in the large scales, by biasing the
limiter surface discussed in the literature before [4]. Namely, if ξc > 0, there would be a number
of intervals [Vk−1, Vk] for the uniform electric poloidal drifts V such that all ﬂuctuations arisen
in the system are damped out fast. In particular, in the ﬁrst order of perturbation theory, there
exists one threshold value Vc such that the instability in the system is bent down as V > Vc.
However, Vc → ∞

To get an insight into the statistics of growing ﬂuctuations of particle density that appear

as ξc →

0.

as high-density blobs of particles close to the reactor wall, we note that their growth rates are

determined by the advanced Green’s functions analytical in the lower half plain of the frequency

space. We replace the rather complicated dynamical process of creation and convection of

growing density ﬂuctuations by the turbulent ﬂow with the problem of discrete time random

walks concluding at a boundary. Such a substitution can be naturally interpreted as a Monte

Carlo simulation procedure for the particle ﬂux. Herewith, the wandering time spectra which

determine the pdf of the particle ﬂux in such a toy model are either exponential or bounded by

the exponential from above. This observation is in a qualitative agreement with the numerical

Abstract
The structural properties of an economical model for a conﬁned plasma turbulence governor
are investigated through bifurcation and stability analyses. A close relationship is demonstrated
between the underlying bifurcation framework of the model and typical behavior associated with
low- to high-conﬁnement transitions such as shear ﬂow stabilization of turbulence and oscillatory
collective action. In particular, the analysis evinces two types of discontinuous transition that are
qualitatively distinct. One involves classical hysteresis, governed by viscous dissipation. The other
is intrinsically oscillatory and non-hysteretic, and thus provides a model for the so-called dithering
transitions that are frequently observed. This metamorphosis, or transformation, of the system
dynamics is an important late side-eﬀect of symmetry-breaking, which manifests as an unusual
non-symmetric transcritical bifurcation induced by a signiﬁcant shear ﬂow drive.

I.

Fusion plasmas, and possibly other quasi two-dimensional ﬂuid systems, may undergo a
more-or-less dramatic transition from a low to a high conﬁnement state (the L–H transi-
tion) as the power input is increased, with the desirable outcome that particle and energy
conﬁnement is greatly improved due to localized transport reduction [1]. In this work we
report on a bifurcation and stability probe of an economical model for L–H transition dy-
namics that uncovers a mechanism by which a radical change, or metamorphosis, may occur
in the qualitative nature of the dynamics. We apply the results of this analysis to clarify
the relationship between the structure of the model and the physics of the process that it
describes, and draw comparisons with characteristics of L–H transitions observed in various
experiments.

Since 1988 there has been much progress in developing low-dimensional (low-order or
reduced) descriptions of L–H transition dynamics and associated oscillatory phenomena
(see, for example, Refs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), the driving force being the
potential power of a uniﬁed, low-dimensional model as a predictive tool for the design and
control of conﬁnement states. For example, a model that speaks of the shape and extent
of hysteresis in the L–H transition would help engineers who are interested in controlling
access to H-mode. Given the many variables and parameters that could be varied around
a hysteretic r´egime, it would be cheaper—i.e., save hundreds of cpu hours and/ or many
expensive diagnostics—to know in advance which ones actually do aﬀect the hysteresis, and
which do not.

To help construe the context in which low-dimensional descriptions of plasma dynamics
are sought, it is appropriate at this stage to make some general remarks. It makes sense to
try to ﬁnd the simplest description of an evolving system that is consistent with the time
and space scales on which one is interested in making experimental observations of that
system. One would like the description to incorporate the qualitative nature of the system
structure and dynamics, so that it can be used for design and control purposes and make
useful predictions. A truly useful description usually turns out to be a low-dimensional
system of coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations. Such descriptions are powerful because
they are supported by well-developed theories that give qualitative and global insight, such as
bifurcation, stability, and symmetry theory [16, 17]. In principle we can map analytically the
bifurcation structure of the entire state and parameter space of a low-dimensional dynamical
system, but this is not yet possible for an inﬁnite-dimensional system.

However, the quest for a low-dimensional state space that captures the qualitative dy-
namics of L–H transitions has been problematic. It has been shown [15, 18] that some of
the models cited above do not reﬂect salient features of L–H transitions such as shear ﬂow
suppression of turbulence, or are incomplete, or show profound structural discrepancies,
although it is intuitively reasonable to expect that manifestly diﬀerent models should be
equivalent at some deeper level if they describe the same phenomena.

By economical, or minimal, model we mean the smallest, functionally simplest, and
mathematically consistent model that captures qualitatively the dynamical traits that are
typically observed over many experiments in diﬀerent machines. The strength and potency of
a minimal model is just this universality; its apparent disregard for details, numbers and unit
dimensions is sometimes perceived—wrongly—as a weakness. In keeping with this ideology
we introduce here a consensus dynamical model that is economical in terms of variables and
parameters, and incorporates the smallest number of rate processes of simplest functional

form needed to reﬂect the universally observed dynamics.
If the model is successful we
expect additional terms to have only quantitative, not qualitative or structural, eﬀects. We
should also be able to identify easily its limits of validity, or where it breaks down and why.
In section II we introduce the plasma turbulence governor as a useful schema to con-
ceptualize and represent the major contributing rate and feedback processes, relating these
to the corresponding dynamical system. Bifurcation and stability analyses and interpretive
discussions, with reference to reported experiments, are given in the remaining sections. In
section III we begin by determining the two highest order (most degenerate) singularities in
the system, or organizing centers. Section IV describes the generic bifurcation diagram and
discusses the hysteresis and limit cycles in the system. In section V we illustrate and dis-
cuss the useful properties of the two-parameter bifurcation diagram. This discussion leads
in to section VI, in which we determine explicitly the transcritical metamorphosis to an
oscillatory, non-hysteretic r´egime. A short summary is given in section VII. The Appendix
contains a derivation of the dynamical equations.

II.

The schematic in Fig. 1 is a primitive of a plasma turbulence governor.

(The name
is intended to refer to archetypical mechanical exemplars of feedback controllers such as
James Watt’s 1788 steam-engine governor.
In [19] a comparable scheme was called the
“barotropic governor”, in the context of quasi two-dimensional atmospheric ﬂows.) A power
input q creates a pressure gradient P from which the turbulent density ﬂuctuation intensity
N grows at a rate with coeﬃcient γ. The turbulence feeds energy into the poloidal shear
ﬂow v via the Reynolds stress α. The shear ﬂow is generated externally at rate ϕ and
damped by the ion viscosity µ. The turbulence is damped quadratically with coeﬃcient β.
Also indicated is a competitive distribution of energy from the pressure gradient, whereby

diﬀerent fractions may partition into turbulence generation and shear ﬂow damping. It is
not diﬃcult to appreciate how the various rate and competitive processes in Fig. 1 could
balance out—or rather, un-balance out—so as to give rise to the oscillatory and hysteretic
dynamics that are characteristic of L–H transitions.

The reduced dynamical system that models this scheme is based on the Sugama-Horton
model [7], which itself was derived from approximate resistive MHD vorticity and pressure
convection equations [20, 21]:

In terms of the shear ﬂow kinetic energy F = v2 Eqs 2 and 3 may be written as

The derivation of this system is given in the Appendix. The most important modiﬁcation
to the original Sugama-Horton model is the symmetry-breaking term ϕ in Eq. 3. It will be
seen that this term, which may be interpreted as an external shear ﬂow driving rate, has
dramatic eﬀects on the bifurcation structure of the system.

The ﬁrst and second terms in the bipartite viscosity function, Eq. 4, model the neoclas-
sical and anomalous viscosity damping respectively.
In a plasma of low collisionality the
exponent m is negative so a high pressure gradient has the eﬀect of blocking the neoclassical
contribution. (Refer to Fig. 1.) Under these circumstances energy can accumulate in the
shear ﬂow then feed back into turbulence decorrelation. On the other hand, a high pres-
sure gradient and high turbulence levels both enhance the anomalous viscosity damping,
because the exponent r is positive. The net eﬀect will depend on the relativity of the three
competitive rates involved in the distribution of energy from the pressure gradient.

III.

Generally in bifurcation analysis we are interested in the multiplicity, stability, sin-
gularity, and parameter dependence of zero solutions of a bifurcation equation g =
G(x, λ1, λ2, . . . , λn), where x is a state variable and the λi are parameters, that is deriv-
able (in principle if not always in practice) from the equilibria of a dynamical system.

Obviously (since gP P must equal 0), compliance with these conditions also implies the exis-
tence of hysteresis.

To specify the dependence of the viscosity damping on the pressure gradient in Eq. 4 we
set m =
3/2 and r = 1, as in [7]. This value of m applies for the temperature dependence
of the ion viscosity in a low collisional r´egime [22]. The value of r = 1 is the simplest that is
consistent with the suggested dependence of the anomalous viscosity on the ion temperature
in [23].

At P* the two non-degeneracy conditions in Eq. 6 evaluate as gP q = 8a/α, gP P P =
18aγ2/(αβ). A pitchfork is described as a codimension 2 singularity, because its uni-

versal unfolding requires 2 parameters additional to the principal bifurcation parameter.
Note that the second unfolding parameter, chosen here as b, can be any of the dissipative
parameters a, b, or β. For reference the bifurcation diagram in Fig. 2 has been computed
and plotted for the critical set (P*). The singular point on the v = 0 branch at high q
complies with the conditions

that satisﬁes these conditions is usually termed a transcritical bifurcation, or sometimes a

For non-critical values of b (i.e., b

critical bifurcation on the v = 0 branch. These two transcriticals coalesce and annihilate
each other at a second codimension 2 singularity D* on the v = 0 branch, deﬁned by the

be extremely dull and ﬂat—it consists only of the line v = 0. Such a highly dissipative
system has no interesting behaviour at all.

IV.

A bifurcation diagram for non-critical values of the unfolding parameters b and ϕ is
shown in Fig. 3. (In the bifurcation diagrams stable solution branches are indicated by solid
lines, unstable branches by dashed lines, and the dotted lines trace out the maximum and
minimum amplitude of limit cycle branches.) The symmetry evident in Fig. 2 is broken by
selection of a small positive value of ϕ, which determines a preferred direction of the poloidal
shear ﬂow.

Branches of stable limit cycles emanate from Hopf bifurcations on the +v and

v H-mode
branches. They reﬂect reports from experiments that a transition to a quiescent H-mode can
be achieved followed by the onset of oscillatory behaviour, or edge-localised modes (ELMs),
as the power input continues to be increased [24, 25, 26, 27]. The original Sugama-Horton
model was found to exhibit a chaotic time series for a particular set of parameter values in

this r´egime [28]. In our model we have found that this branch of limit cycles can undergo
several successive period doublings followed by period halvings back to a period-one limit
cycle.

The limit cycles are also extinguished at Hopf bifurcations.

In [15] it was shown that
oscillatory behaviour is regulated by the contribution of the pressure gradient evolution. At
moderately high power input the pressure gradient and turbulence are high, neoclassical
viscous damping is inhibited, and large amplitude oscillations would be expected as energy
alternately accumulates in the shear ﬂow and is exchanged with the turbulence. The relative
phases of v, N, and P are shown in the time series of Fig. 4. However, this is balanced by
the enhancement of anomalous viscosity damping by the larger amounts of turbulence and
pressure gradient energy at higher power inputs. (Refer to the governor schematized in Fig.
1.) As this anomalous viscosity eﬀect begins to take over the amplitude of the limit cycles
decreases rapidly until they are extinguished at the Hopf bifurcations at higher q.

Although deﬁnitive experiments have not yet been performed that measure the growth
and extent of the H-mode oscillations over the power input, it is physically reasonable that
they would be limited by some damping factor. The passage through an oscillatory r´egime
with increasing power is a characteristic of type III ELMs [29, 30]. However, the quantitative
features of type III ELMs, such as the frequency spectrum, are not reproduced by this simple
model.

On the v < 0 branch the limit cycles are smaller in amplitude and occur over a smaller
2.5, for example, the +v H-mode is oscillatory but the
v H-mode is quiescent. Again, to our knowledge the appropriate experiments have not

yet been carried out, but this is reminiscent of the prescription given in ref.
[31]: “The
key factors in creating the quiescent H-mode operation are neutral beam injection in the
direction opposite to the plasma current (counterinjection) plus cryopumping to reduce the
density.”

can also be rationalized on the basis of Fig. 3. In a system that is evolved initially onto the
v < 0 branch, the poloidal shear ﬂow must reverse if a perturbation decreases the power input
slightly below that at the lower limit point. Shear ﬂow reversal may also occur anywhere
along the v < 0 branch, if the system is given a suﬃciently strong transient kick.

Note that in Fig. 3 the shear ﬂow v reaches a broad maximum with increasing power
input, then decreases to the the pre-transition level given by the shear ﬂow source. This
would be reasonable behaviour on physical grounds—one would not expect the shear ﬂow to
increase indeﬁnitely with power input, because the turbulent viscosity damping (the second
term in Eq. 4 with r = 1) begins to take over as the power input increases the pressure
gradient.

Clearly there is scope for tuning other parameters in the model so as to obtain a complete
picture of the steady states and limit cycles over parameter space, and more quantitative
agreements with experiments. One may wish, for example, to maximize the range of q over
which turbulence stabilization occurs, or minimize the range of q over which limit cycles
occur, or both.

Figure 3 also shows the hysteresis that is predicted by compliance with the conditions
in Eq. 6. Transitions with hysteresis have been observed in several machines: DIII-D [25],
Asdex Upgrade [34, 35], JET, and in simulations of ITER [26], and Alcator C-Mod [36].
Hysteresis is typically modiﬁed by dissipation, characterised in this model by the parameters
β, b, and a. However, hysteresis does not seem to be a necessary or universal feature of
discontinuous transitions.

One of the typical features of L–H transitions that a minimal model should reﬂect is
suppression of the turbulence by the shear ﬂow. Figure 5 shows the bifurcation diagram
with the mean square turbulence level N as the state variable, where for clarity only the
curve that matches the positive v branch is given. The turbulence is clearly suppressed over
the hysteretic region, then begins to grow again as the higher pressure gradient from higher
power input creates more turbulence.

V.

The width and extent of hysteresis for selected values of b can be judged from the two-
parameter bifurcation diagram for the +v branch in Fig. 6, in which computed curves of
the singular points in Fig. 3 are shown. The solid lines mark the loci of limit points (which
are also sometimes called fold or saddle-node bifurcations) as b is varied. The dot-dash line

is the locus of Hopf bifurcations as b is varied. If one can imagine taking slices across this
diagram at various important values of b, the bifurcation story of the system can be told
compactly, by inferring a reconstruction of the single-parameter (q, v) bifurcation diagram
corresponding to each selected value of b.

A slice taken above the critical value of b at the cusp would yield a (q, v) bifurcation dia-
gram that shows no multiplicity of states. Thus, in a highly dissipative system any transition
is expected to be smooth and gradual rather than discontinuous, and a number of experi-
ments suggest this conjecture. In ASDEX Upgrade the power hysteresis disappears at higher
density (which implies more collisional damping) where gradual rather than discontinuous
conﬁnement improvement occurs [35]. A r´egime in which density ﬂuctuation amplitudes
are reduced continuously was also observed in [37]. In [38] a discontinuous bifurcation of
the electric ﬁeld in a stellarator was reported for conditions of low neutral density, where
the charge-exchange damping rate is low. The change in the electric ﬁeld became gradual
for conditions of high neutral density, because the charge-exchange damping rate increases.
(The electric ﬁeld is related to the poloidal shear ﬂow and the pressure gradient through the
radial force balance [39].)

Oscillatory behaviour is also expected to be damped out at high dissipation rates. The
maximum in the locus of Hopf bifurcations in Fig. 6 occurs at the value of b where the
two Hopf bifurcations on the +v branch in Fig. 3 annihilate each other (or conversely, are
created). Above this value of b the +v branch is stable with no associated limit cycles.

As slices are taken at lower b the hysteresis and the range of oscillatory behavior evidently
become broader. At low dissipation rates the feedback is strong and nonlinear behavior is
expected to be more pronounced.

The crossing of the Hopf and limit point loci in Fig. 6 is non-local, i.e., the value of P
(and of v and N) at the crossing on the Hopf curve is diﬀerent from that on the limit point
curve. Within the overlapping region a direct transition to an oscillatory H-mode may occur.

VI.

The minimum in the limit point curve of Fig. 6 implies the existence of another tran-
scritical bifurcation (deﬁned by Eq. 7) in the system, that occurs at non-zero v. This

non-symmetric transcritical bifurcation may have important issues concerning access to and
control of conﬁnement states. Consider the series of stills in Fig. 7, which snapshot +v
bifurcation diagram sections for increasing values of ϕ.

As ϕ is incremented a separate branch of solutions to Eq. 5, which is trapped at (q, v) =
(0,
) for ϕ = 0, begins to intrude more prominently into the physical region (ϕ = 0.05).
Although it is unstable at ﬁrst, and therefore physically irrelevant for very small values of
ϕ, it does not remain so. The singular occurrence of a zero real eigenvalue and a pair of
complex conjugate eigenvalues with zero real part signals the appearance of a degenerate
Hopf bifurcation. (Eigenvalues were computed numerically.)

Further increments in ϕ separate the limit point and the Hopf bifurcation, between which
the solutions are stable (ϕ = 0.08). The branch of limit cycles that emanates from the Hopf
bifurcation undergoes one or more period doubling bifurcations before ending, presumably
at a homoclinic (inﬁnite period) terminus. This branch of limit cycles is quite short, and
thus not very well resolved in Fig. 7 for the lower values of ϕ. Note also that the branch of
limit cycles emanating from the hysteretic solution branch has also appeared by ϕ = 0.08.
At a metamorphic value of ϕ that we designate ϕT m the arms of the two separate
steady-state branches are exchanged at a transcritical bifurcation. We know this point
is present because the deﬁning conditions Eq. 7 are satisﬁed with ϕ
= 0. (In numbers
(v, q, ϕ)T m = (1.8247.., 0.1468.., 0.08059..), with det d2g =

for calculating steady-state bifurcations such as the pitchfork and transcritical but not for
Hopf bifurcations.)

After the exchange, e.g. at ϕ = 0.085 and ϕ = 0.1, we see the unusual occurrence of three
Hopf bifurcations on the same branch, although this situation could be inferred from the
shallow but distinct minimum and the maximum in the locus of Hopf bifurcations in Fig. 6.
The last frame of Fig. 7, for ϕ = 0.11, is taken after the “new” and the lower-q “old”
Hopf bifurcations have collided and annihilated each other at a singular point associated
with two zero eigenvalues. This is what the minimum in the curve of Hopf bifurcations
means. The branch of limit cycles emanating from the upper-q “old” Hopf bifurcation now

continues to the (presumed) homoclinic terminus. There are a couple of period-doublings on
it (not shown). We also see that the limit cycles are extinguished and a quiescent H-mode
is achieved at the single remaining Hopf bifurcation.

Turning our attention to the stable part of the lower branch in the last frame of Fig. 7,
we see that as q is tuned past the lower limit point the system must jump to another
stable attractor. This transition is very diﬀerent from the intrinsically hysteretic transition
depicted in Fig 3. Here the stable attractor on the upper branch is a limit cycle rather than
a ﬁxed point. Furthermore, this transition is not hysteretic. In fact, hysteresis is (locally)
forbidden by the condition gP P 6
= 0 of Eq. 7. Therefore it is not modulated by dissipation in
the same way as the transition in Fig.3, although the feedback itself is still due to nonlinear
dissipation rates.

As the value of ϕ is increased even further, bifurcation diagrams that one could plot
gradually become less meaningful. This is because ϕ = constant is a ﬁrst approximation,
valid for small ϕ, to to a nonlinear function ϕ(ζ), where ζ may include dynamical variables
and parameters.

This type of transition could serve as a model for the dithering or L–H–L transitions,
followed by a quiescent H-mode, that have been reported in many machines. Although there
may be other mechanisms for dithering transitions—another possible scenario is given at the
end of section V and indicated in Fig. 6, where an oscillatory transition may occur in a very
poorly dissipative system—we have at least a preliminary semiological and classiﬁcation
guide: if your transition is oscillatory and non-hysteretic then perhaps you should look for
a strong shear ﬂow source, if it is strongly hysteretic perhaps you should look at dissipation
mechanisms. Some experimental evidence supports the idea that dithering transitions result
from a strong shear ﬂow source. In [40], an analysis of time series data around the L–H
transition in COMPASS-D suggested that a homoclinic orbit is involved in the change of
stability at the transition. In stellarator W7-AS typically the quiescent ELM-free H-mode
is obtained after a phase characterized by quasi-periodic ELMs [41, 42]. In H1 stellarator
a transition to ﬂuctuating H-mode occurs at lower gas ﬁlling pressures and lower magnetic
ﬁelds than the transition to quiescent H-mode [43].

In terms of the governor in Fig. 1 a shear ﬂow that is generated internally and driven ex-
ternally at comparable rates is likely to give rise to interesting non-linear dynamics, because
more kinetic energy in the shear ﬂow leads to more turbulence suppression through decor-
relation, but also a larger damping eﬀect, which then alters the competitive distribution of
energy from the pressure gradient.

VII.

In summary, this reduced dynamical model, comprised simply of energy input, exchange,
and loss rates, reﬂects generic characteristics of conﬁned plasma bulk dynamics that have
not been reﬂected in previous models. The bifurcation and stability analysis also reveals
two qualitatively diﬀerent transitions. The hysteretic transition is controlled by the damping
rate coeﬃcients. The non-hysteretic transition occurs when there is a relatively strong shear
ﬂow drive.

Symmetry-breaking in this system has two major eﬀects. Firstly, a non-zero shear ﬂow
drive is physically inevitable, even in the best-controlled experiments, and it determines a
preferred direction for the shear ﬂow. Secondly, it interacts with the internal generation and
loss dynamics to cause the metamorphosis shown in Fig. 7.

More generally, the information obtained from this analysis strengthens the thesis devel-
oped in [17]: that remarkably low-dimensional models can capture and help explain essential

aspects of turbulent ﬂows that elude understanding from numerical simulations that include
resolved spatial scales, and that physical deductions can be made from observations of bi-
furcations.

Reduced MHD ﬂuid equations in tokamak and stellarator geometries were originally de-
rived by Strauss [20, 21]. In the electrostatic approximation, a damped MHD ﬂuid may be
described by the following momentum and pressure convection equations:

B = ηJ. The symbols and notation are explained in
table I. The curl of Eq. 9 yields a vorticity equation, which is sometimes preferred in
two-dimensional ﬂuid dynamics, but we have used the momentum form because it is more
transparent physically and has a simpler correspondence to the kinetic energy. An inﬁnite
slab conﬁguration is used for simplicity and generality, as was also assumed in [44] for a drift-

kinetic treatment of plasma relaxation. It is sketched in Fig. 8, where the region
can be taken to represent a region at the edge or within a conﬁned plasma where a transport
barrier evolves.

V (x). Similar equations, without the symmetry-breaking
y, t), V (x)
term in the momentum balance, have been used by several authors [7, 23, 45, 46, 47] as a
basis for studying resistive turbulence–ﬂow interactions. The symmetry-breaking term was
introduced in [23], but only a posteriori as an adjunct in an equation for the background
poloidal ﬂow. Here we introduce it at the outset. It models the friction force acting between
the single-ﬂuid plasma velocity v and an assumed external poloidal ﬂow V ˆy. Although V ˆy
may be described for convenience as an external velocity, the term represents any asymmet-
ric shear-inducing mechanism, such as friction with neutrals, non-ambipolar ion orbit losses,
or neoclassical eﬀects not included in the slab model.

That is, it is assumed that we have made a Galilean transformation to the frame in which
the spatial average of v0 across the slab is zero. For simplicity we also assume that the
spatial average of V is zero.

Equations 9 and 10 are not intended to express a detailed ﬂuid description of a plasma,
but are intended instead to represent a qualitatively authentic, semi-empirical model for the
essential generation and loss processes that give rise to the turbulence–shear ﬂow interactions
that we have schematized in Fig. 1 as the plasma turbulence governor. The dynamical
system Eqs 1–3 can be derived from Eqs 9 and 10, following the spatial averaging procedure
implicit in [7].

The spatially averaged dynamical system thus consists of Eqs 15, 13, and 17. For closure

we follow [7], using the approximations p0(x)
δ) + xdv0/dx for the background pressure and ﬂow proﬁles and re-deﬁning P and F as the
gradient terms alone. Approximations or expressions based on empirical arguments were
given in [7] for the rates in Eqs 13, 15, and 17. The rates given in Eqs 1–3 are economized
versions of those expressions, in the sense that simpler power laws were chosen if this did not
result in any qualitative changes to the singularity and stability structure of the system. The
rationale is that for most of the rates we shall only learn from experiments whether diﬀerent
powers apply, meanwhile simple power laws give more transparent algebra. We approximate
the energy transfer rate from the pressure gradient simply as EN ≃
(γ/ε)P N, and the
energy transfer rate between the turbulence and the shear ﬂow, due to the Reynolds stress,
q/ε. The two-
as EF ≃

αF N. The power input through the boundary is deﬁned as Ep ≡

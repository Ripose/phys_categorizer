We solve analytically the out-of-equilibrium initial stage that follows the injection of a radially
ﬁnite electron beam into a plasma at rest and test it against particle-in-cell simulations. For initial
large beam edge gradients and not too large beam radius, compared to the electron skin depth, the
electron beam is shown to evolve into a ring structure. For low enough transverse temperatures,
the ﬁlamentation instability eventually proceeds and saturates when transverse isotropy is reached.
The analysis accounts for the variety of very recent experimental beam transverse observations.

Beam-plasma interactions have recently received some
considerable renewed interest especially in the relatively
unexplored regimes of high beam intensities and high
plasma densities. One particular motivation lies in the
fast ignition schemes (FIS) for inertial conﬁnement fu-
sion [1]. These should involve in their ﬁnal stage the in-
teraction of an ignition beam composed of MeV electrons
laser generated at the critical density surface with a dense
plasma target. The exploration of the electron beam
transport into the overdense plasma is essential to assess
the eﬃciency of the beam energy deposit. In this mat-
ter, transverse beam-plasma instabilities could be partic-
ularly deleterious in preventing conditions for burn to be
met. Experimental observations recently undertaken in
conditions relevant to the FIS have either shown some
transverse microscopic ﬁlamentation of electron beams
[2] or some transverse, predominantly macroscopic, beam
evolution into a ring structure [3, 4] or a superposition of
those eﬀects [4, 5, 6], with ﬁlaments standing out from
a ring structure, in a scenario similar to Taguchi et al.’s
numerical simulations [7]. Weibel instability [8] is com-
monly invoked to account for these phenomena, but it
is sometimes diﬃcult to ﬁnd any clear univocal evidence
supporting this. Moreover the fact is that, whereas most
theoretical and some computational studies are devoted
to the linear regime of instabilities originating from cur-
rent and charge neutralized equilibria, the physics of the
fast ignition is intrinsically out-of-equilibrium.

In this Letter, we shall consider the out-of-equilibrium
initial value dynamical problem taking place when a radi-
ally inhomogeneous electron forward current is launched
into a plasma and is still not current compensated. We
shall focus on this early stage where collisions may be ne-
glected. Ions will be assumed to form a ﬁxed neutralizing
background. In order to simplify both the analysis and
the numerical PIC computations, we shall consider the

system to be inﬁnite along the beam direction z. We shall
remove any z dependance by assuming also that plasma
density npe is uniform and constant. At time t = 0, a
relativistic electron beam is switched on in the plasma.
Maxwell equations are linear and can thus be solved for
all time to give the electromagnetic ﬁelds as functions of
the sources, namely beam and plasma current densities,
jb and jpe. We get rot B = µ0(jpe + jb) + 1/c2∂E/∂t
and rot E = −∂B/∂t. The electron plasma current jpe =
−enpevpe is initially vanishing and may be approximated
by linear ﬂuid theory in the initial stage yielding

the ﬂuid approximation for the bulk plasma remains ap-
proximately valid, mode transfers will originate from the
beam particles equations of motion. Consequently, if the
initial beam is rigorously both rotationally and axially in-
variant (on m = 0), it will remain so for all times. Then
there are no sources to feed the triad (Br, Bz, Eθ) that
remains vanishingly small. This is an invitation to focus
ﬁrst on the m = 0 evolution.

We consider initial beam density and velocity of
nb0(r) = nb0 ¯n(˜r) and vb0z(r) = vb0z ¯v(˜r), with ˜r = r/rb.
Let us introduce here the beam radius rb [9], the elec-
tron skin depth λs ≡ c/ωpe, their ratio η ≡ rb/λs, and
let us deﬁne α = nb0/npe, β0 = vb0z/c and the ini-

g(r | a) = I1 (σr<) K1 (σr>) with r< = min(r, a) and

We now wish to compute the beam evolution under
the previous self-ﬁelds (7), which was ignored in previ-
ous studies [11]. Let us assume that the beam can be

Let us write nb = nb0+nb1(r, t), vbr = vb1r(r, t) and vbz =

get a natural hierarchy: ﬁrst order terms should be of
order α, second order terms of order α2 and so on. Let
us explicit ﬁrst order ﬂuid equations. The radial electric

Eq. (17) shows that nb1 has a secular behavior. Thus the
present analysis breaks when nb1/nb0 = O(1), namely
roughly for ωpet ∼ α−1/2.
In order to put this more
precisely, we shall study the radial behavior ¯n1. Let us
consider some initially monokinetic beam (¯v = 1) having
density functions of the form

¯n(˜r) = (tanh [2κ(1 − ˜r)] + 1) /2.

(19)

This enables the study of the inﬂuence of the beam edge
gradients as κ = −¯n′(˜r = 1). Fig. 1 displays various
¯n proﬁles and their associated ﬁrst order perturbations
¯n1. This shows that, within a given initial lapse of time,
the natural evolution of the system tends to increase the
beam density around some radius below rb. This favors
the formation of a ring structure for the beam density,

that is all the sharper and all the closer to rb that the
initial radial beam gradients are high. The emergence of
this beam ring formation can be already inferred from
the time evolution of test electrons within the azimuthal
magnetic self-ﬁeld corresponding to some given initial
proﬁle ¯n of the form (19) as shown in Fig. 2. The caus-
tics pattern signals there a cusp formation in the radial
beam density. It is important to note that, due to Eq.
(6), this behavior is very dependent on the initial beam
proﬁle. Indeed, we observed no such caustics pattern nor
any visible evolution towards a ring structure for smooth
Gaussian initial beam proﬁle, but rather radial focusing
prior to the ﬁlamentation onset.

FIG. 2: Radial trajectories of test electrons for an initial beam
proﬁle given by Eq. (19) with η = κ = 10.

In order to assess the validity of the ﬁrst-order ana-
lytical results presented above and get an insight into

3

the longer time evolution of the beam-plasma system,
we performed particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations using the
code CALDER [12] in 2-1/2 dimensions (x, y, vx, vy, vz).
All species, namely plasma ions and electrons and beam
electrons, are described as particles. Beam electrons are
injected at t = 0 in a plasma without current compensa-
tion and λs = 0.05 µm. Fig. 3 presents the early time
evolution of the beam radial and poloidal mean veloci-
ties. The initial beam density proﬁle was given by Eq.
(19) with η = 10 and κ = 2. The beam was monoki-
netic with γ0 = 15 and α was equal to 0.03. For beam
radial velocity, this ﬁgure shows a nice agreement with
the analytical result (15). As for beam poloidal veloc-
ity, it is initially vanishing and its m = 0 component
does remain so. However, poloidal symmetry eventu-
ally breaks due to the arising of ﬁlamentation instabil-
ity. This takes place after a short transient during which
plasma backcurrent grows. Then the average poloidal
velocity start to grow exponentially, with a growth rate
that nicely ﬁts the linear ﬁlamentation instability one,
α/γ0ωpe [13, 14].

Beam and plasma transverse temperatures are 1keV.

Fig. 4 presents the longer term evolution of the trans-
verse components of beam velocity for a monokinetic
beam with a larger value of α (α = 0.15) and smaller γ0
(γ0 = 3). As previously, there is an initial phase, between
t=0 and 20ω−1
pe , during which radial velocity grows fast
and poloidal velocity remains small. For ωpet ≃ 20, we
can see on the inset of Fig. 4 that beam density presents a
clear ring structure at its edge. When the beam current
is partially neutralized, ﬁlamentation instability starts,
breaking the initial azimuthal system symmetry and pro-
ducing the exponential growth of poloidal beam velocity.
When the instability saturates (ωpet ≃ 35), the mag-
nitudes of both components of the transverse velocity
are similar: transverse isotropy is reached. For η larger

(not shown here), the relative thickness of the initial ring
diminishes and once ﬁlamentation saturates, the initial
structure becomes almost undetectable.

. Zero emittance
for beams with angular divergence of 15
(a-b) and large emittance (0.25 µm) cases (c-d) are shown.

Finally, the evolution changes signiﬁcantly for beams
with ﬁnite initial angular divergence. Experimentally, it
was found [15] that electron beams created by focalizing

4

a laser pulse over a solid target may present divergencies
as large as 17◦. The origin of these large divergencies is
not clear. We performed simulations with beams having
an angular divergency of 15◦ and two values of emittance.
For zero emittance (laminar beam) a dim ring structure
appears at short times (Fig. 5(a)), then ﬁlamentation
takes place (Fig. 5(b)). The large radial velocity pro-
duces a fast coalescence of the ﬁlaments along the radial
direction, resulting in a star-like density pattern. In the
high emittance case (Fig. 5(c-d)), no ring structure is ap-
parent. Moreover, the large transverse temperature pre-
vents the onset of the ﬁlamentation instability [14, 16].

In conclusion, our analysis has shown that, depending
on its initial radial density and velocity distribution, the
shape of an electron beam propagating in a plasma may
evolve into a transient ring structure. This results from
the natural evolution of the system and not from the
usually invoked Weibel instability. If its transverse tem-
perature is low enough, ﬁlamentation instability eventu-
ally proceeds. The observation of the ring structure is
favored by sharp beam edges and not too large beam
radius (compared to the electron skin depth). It is not
generic which may explain the variety of experimental
observations [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

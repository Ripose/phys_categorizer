In this work, we use a passive advection model for ion temperature ﬂuctuations, in order to
investigate their eﬀects on Doppler Spectral line shapes. The relevance of the model is discussed
in the framework of the Braginskii equations, and the subsequent Probability Density Function
evaluation relies on results obtained in neutral ﬂuids. The resulting Doppler line proﬁles are shown
to exhibit characteristic exponential tails.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The understanding of turbulence in fusion devices has made great progress since it was ﬁrst realized that turbulent
ﬂuctuations could explain the anomalously high level of cross magnetic ﬁeld transport which was plaguing experiments.
Theoretical studies, many of which have focused on the identiﬁcation of underlying linear or non linear instabilities [1],
have produced valuable results. Direct Numerical Simulation, which is the only tool able to encompass the complexity
of the problem (non linear equations, multiple ﬁelds and complex geometry), has shed additional light on the respective
contributions of these instabilities (e.g.
[2]). Edge plasma turbulence has speciﬁc properties and is, in particular,
characterized by high ﬂuctuation levels which can rise up to 30 % [3, 4]. The development of sophisticated diagnostics
[5]), which impose more stringent
methods now provides detailed experimental data on density ﬂuctuations (e. g.
constraints on the theory. However, very few measurements of ion temperature ﬂuctuations have been reported to
date. A notable exception is Ref.
[4], in which High Frequency Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy is
used to show that ion temperature ﬂuctuations rates can be large. In previous works [6, 7], we have investigated the
possible role of turbulence on Doppler line shapes obtained by passive spectroscopy. Ion temperature ﬂuctuations
were shown to lead to signiﬁcant modiﬁcations in the line wings, provided their PDF (Probability Density Function)
had fat tails. This suggests that passive spectroscopy, for which the experimental set-up is relatively simple, might
provide information on ion temperature ﬂuctuations. Here, making use of results obtained in neutral ﬂuids, we show
that even a very simpliﬁed model for ion temperature ﬂuctuations, i.e. passive advection, leads to non Gaussian
PDFs. The corresponding asymptotic behavior of the Doppler line proﬁles is obtained analytically.

II. DOPPLER SPECTRA IN TURBULENT PLASMAS

The spectra Im(∆λ) measured using passive spectroscopy is obtained from integration both during the acquisition

time of the spectrometer τ and along the line of sight (LOS) (Oz). The corresponding expression is

where L is the emitting zone length, B(z, t) the brightness of the line and I(∆λ, z, t) the local line shape. Both of these
quantities are determined by the plasma parameters and the line under study. Here we consider Dα (n = 3 to n = 2
transition, λ0 = 6561 ˚A), which is intense and routinely monitored. The brightness essentially depends on the electron
density and temperature. For ionizing edge plasma conditions, that is Ne = 1019 − 1020 m−3 and Te = 10 − 100 eV,
Stark eﬀects can be safely neglected. We will therefore deal with the Doppler line proﬁle of one Zeeman component.
Here we only consider the contribution from the class of neutrals created locally by charge exchange, I(∆λ, z, t) →
I cx(∆λ, X). In fact, neutrals created via other channels, i.e molecular dissociation and charge exchange in the inner
plasma are not strongly coupled to the ions at the edge [8], i.e. to edge turbulence. These neutrals can be accounted
for using neutral transport codes. The charge exchange neutrals Velocity Distribution Function (VDF) along the
LOS, f cx(v, X), is related to the Doppler proﬁle by f cx(v, X)dv = I cx(∆λ, X)d∆λ. Here it has been made explicit
that the space and time dependence of the spectra and VDF occurs only through the local ion ﬂuid ﬁelds X(z, t)
(local number and charge densities, species temperatures, and ﬂow velocities), since the ion VDF is assumed to be
a local Maxwellian. We consider the case where the LOS is such that the average gradients of these ﬁelds along its

direction (e.g., parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld lines) are weak . It was shown in Ref. [6, 7] that the measured spectra
can then be written as

I cx
m (∆λ) =

dXW (X)B(X)I cx(∆λ, X),

Z

where W (X) is the joint PDF of the ﬁelds. To proceed, the role of the diﬀerent ﬂuid ﬁelds can be investigated
separately. For Doppler line shapes, ﬂuid velocity and temperature ﬂuctuations give rise to the main eﬀects, because
the shape of the local VDF fcx does not depend on Ne. We further simplify the problem by considering ion temperature
ﬂuctuations alone. The rationale behind that assumption is twofold : ﬁrst, the role of velocity ﬂuctuations is well
known in plasma spectroscopy [9]. Secondly, the analysis carried out in our previous work showed that line wings are
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by temperature ﬂuctuations characterized by a slowly decaying tail. Therefore, we expect that
inclusion of velocity ﬂuctuations would not signiﬁcatively shroud the conclusions drawn here, since line wings could
only be aﬀected by ﬂuid velocities several times larger than the ion thermal velocity. Moreover, if the LOS is parallel
to the magnetic ﬁelds, there are conditions under which parallel velocity ﬂuctuations are small while temperature
ﬂuctuations are not [4]. As a result, the remainder of this contribution will be devoted to temperature ﬂuctuations.

III. SIMPLIFIED MODEL FOR THE ION TEMPERATURE

We start from the Braginskii equations [10], and focus on the ion thermal balance

which we simplify using the drift wave ordering. Here dt = ∂t + vi · ∇ stands for the convective derivative, qi for the
thermal ﬂux, παβ is the stress tensor, σαβ = ∂αvβ and Qi is the energy exchange with other species. We consider
ﬂuctuations having a small scale ˜l with respect to the quasi equilibrium background of radial gradient length L⊥.
Typically ρs . ˜l, where ρs is the ion Larmor radius calculated with the electron temperature. For each ﬁeld X, we
distinguish between its time averaged part ¯X and its ﬂuctuating part
X. The small scale parameter with respect to
which the ﬂuid equations are expended is δ = ˜l/L⊥. The perpendicular velocity is given by vi⊥ = vE + v⋆
i , that
is by the sum of the electric drift, ion diamagnetic and ion polarization velocities. The diamagnetic velocity does not
directly advect temperature, because for low β (the ratio of the kinetic to the magnetic pressure) its eﬀect cancels out
with that of the diamagnetic thermal ﬂux, up to magnetic curvature terms which will be neglected in the following.
vE ≃ 0, i.e. the ﬂuctuating electric drift velocity ﬂow is incompressible.
The same approximations ensure that ∇ ·
The ion polarization velocity is of higher order in δ and we further neglect parallel advection, which is justiﬁed in the
drift ordering [11]. The resulting equation for ion temperature ﬂuctuations is then

Ti (see for example the system of equations considered in Ref. [2]). However, the ion temperature does
not play any role in the parallel electron dynamics, in contrast to the electron temperature which is strongly coupled
vE. In addition, many if not most edge turbulence studies carried out so
to the electrostatic potential, and hence to
far did not include ion temperature ﬂuctuations, by considering cold ions (Ti ≪ Te). This approximation is justiﬁed
partly by the fact that ion temperature does not play a fundamental role for the instabilities which are thought to be
dominant in edge plasmas (collisional drift waves, resistive ballooning). In fact, inclusion of
Ti does not qualitatively
change the nature of the turbulence observed in the simulations [2], and the few experimental results available are
not inconsistent with passive advection, as pointed out in [4]. In this work, we therefore treat ion temperature as

a passive scalar driven by the ﬂuctuating electric drift velocity ﬁeld. This has the major advantage to lead to an
analytically tractable model. Let us now specify the typical values of the P´eclet and the Prandtl numbers, which
will play a role in the next section, for edge plasma turbulence. The P´eclet number, Pe = ˜l˜v/κi⊥, where ˜l and ˜v are
the typical length scales and velocity of the turbulent ﬂuctuations, controls the relative importance of advection and
diﬀusion. If we take ˜l ∼ 10ρs ∼ 2 × 10−3 m and ˜v ∼ ˜vE ∼ ˜v⋆
i ∼ Ti/(eBL⊥) ∼ 75 m.s−1 with L⊥ = 2 cm, we get
Pe ∼ 102 ≫ 1, so that advection dominates the heat transport. The Prandtl number Pr = νi⊥/κi⊥, where νi⊥ is the
perpendicular ion viscosity is of order unity since νi⊥/κi⊥ ∼ 1 [10].

IV. REVIEW OF ANALYTICAL CALCULATIONS OF THE PASSIVE SCALAR PDF

Since ˜Ti and ˜v are rapidly ﬂuctuating quantities, we adopt a stochastic description of the velocity ﬁeld. For the
sake of tractability, the latter is described by a Gaussian probability density functional, whose correlation function is
chosen so as to reproduce some of the main features of turbulence [12], that is

Cαβ(r, t) = hvα(r, t)vβ (0, 0)i = ΠαβV ξ exp(−|r|/ξ)δ(t)

(5)

e

Ti(r, t))i, or equivalently its Fourier transform Z(λ) = hexp(−iλ

where Παβ (r) ensures consistency with incompressibility [13] (at zeroth order in r, Πab = δab), and the white noise
limit has been taken. Here, the correlation length ξ and the typical velocity V are such that ξ ∼ ˜l and V ∼ ˜v. The
time average is thus replaced by an ensemble average denoted by h·i. In this section, we show how the ion temperature
Ti(r, t))i, can be obtained from
PDF W (θ) = hδ(θ −
Eq. (4). Here, θ is a sample space variable, and λ its conjugated Fourier variable. Mathematically, the brackets
v at all space and time points. The PDF does not depend on t and r
denote functional integration over the ﬁeld
e
because of stationarity and homogeneity, the latter stemming from the fact that the average temperature gradient is
constant. The derivation presented here is drawn from the neutral ﬂuid community, which has given much attention
to the passive advection problem. Indeed, its study allows to unravel important eﬀects also at play in Navier-Stokes
turbulence. The passive scalar equation is linear in
Ti, but bilinear in the ﬂuctuations and can thus generate non
linear eﬀects. The scalar PDF W (θ) can therefore have strong non Gaussian features even though the velocity ﬁeld is
Gaussian. This is very well illustrated by the early work of Sinai and Yakhot, who found power law tails for the PDF
in homogeneous decaying turbulence [14]. The derivation relies on a transport equation for the PDF, which involves
coeﬃcients whose temperature dependence has to be determined from rather uncontrolled assumptions. This diﬃculty
arises because diﬀusion introduces correlations between the scalar ﬁeld and its gradients. The physical reason for this
is most easily understood using a Lagrangian picture. In the weak thermal diﬀusion limit (i.e. large P´eclet number
Pe ≫ 1, see below), advection is the dominant initial eﬀect and the ﬂuid particles follow the Lagrangian trajectories
deﬁned by dtR(t) = v(R(t), t|R0) where R(t = 0) = R0 = r. The velocity ﬁeld is linearized around the Lagrangian
vα(R(t), t) + σαβ(R(t), t) (rβ − Rβ(t))), where σαβ(R(t), t) = ∂αvβ(R(t), t) is the strain ﬁeld
trajectory (
along the trajectory. Two points in a ﬂuid element, initially close will be displaced by this strain ﬁeld. Due to the
condition of incompressibility, one direction will involve an exponentially large separation as a function of time. As a
consequence of this so-called ”advective stretching”, the spectra of temperature ﬂuctuations are extended to smaller
and smaller scales. When the diﬀusive scale is eventually reached, regions of large gradient are selectively dissipated,
introducing correlations between the temperature ﬁeld and its gradient [15]. The PDF obtained in Ref. [14] has been
used as an example in our previous work [6, 7], but from the section 3 it is clear that an additive noise should also be
taken into account. The corresponding transport equation for the PDF could straightforwardly be written down, but
ﬁnding its solution would require further assumptions on the correlations between
S [16]. From the discussion
above it is obvious that a Lagrangian description would allow to capture more of the physics. The remainder of this
section will be devoted to show how this unfolds. The ﬁrst diﬃculty when carrying out the average in Z(λ) lies in the
e
fact that there are two diﬀerent sources of noise associated with
vEx) and one multiplicative
vE · ∇). An elegant way to disentangle their respective contributions is to calculate the Green’s function G for Eq.

This has the advantage to allow averaging on the additive noise as a ﬁrst step. The latter is independent of the
vE in G(r, t|r′, t′) in the limit of white noise. Physically speaking this occurs when the time scale for

Here r(t; 0, 0) is the backwards Lagrangian trajectory, i.e. the position at which the ﬂuid particle which is at time t = 0
at position r = 0 was at time t < 0, not taking into account diﬀusion. The second term in Eq. (8) is a damping term
originating from diﬀusion, where the time dependence of k(t) describes the eﬀect of stretching integrated along the
Lagrangian trajectory. The norm of k grows exponentially for the velocity ﬁeld considered here, so that this second
G(0, 0|k0, t⋆)| ∼ 1/2. The larger the
term basically behaves as a step function at a time t⋆, which can be deﬁned as |
strain along the trajectory, the smaller t⋆. For t < t⋆ the ﬂuid particle follow the diﬀusionless Lagrangian trajectory
with constant temperature, and then the latter is quickly homogenized because of the large gradients induced by
stretching. Since the modulus of the Green’s function only depends on the velocity ﬁeld through the strain tensor
σ (see Eq. (8)-(9)), the velocity average is then converted into an average over realizations of σ. Carrying out the
calculation is tedious, but only involves some additional mild approximations [12]. The resulting PDF has a Gaussian
core and an asymptotical behavior which is exponential, that is using non dimensional quantities

where γ = (d + 6)/2d is the secular growth rate, and d the dimensionality of the problem (γ = 2 in 2D) [12]. The
same result has been obtained using Jensen’s ﬁeld theoretical formalism [17]. Taking an additive noise into account,
as required by the derivation of Eq. (4), therefore leads to a PDF which has an exponential tail instead of the power
law tail obtained for decaying turbulence. The PDF is however still markedly non Gaussian.

V. CALCULATIONS OF DOPPLER SPECTRA

We now consider the modiﬁcations resulting from temperature ﬂuctuations on line shapes, given the PDF obtained
in the previous section. The Doppler line shape Im(∆λ) can be calculated numerically from Eq. (2) for any given
W (θ), noting that the brightness of the line B does not sensitively depend on the ion temperature. However, it is
interesting ﬁrst to obtain an analytical expression of the proﬁle. This can be done for PDFs behaving asymptotically
as W (θ) ∼ θ−α exp − (θ/θ0)β. The asymptotic behavior of the measured Doppler proﬁle can then be calculated using
a saddle point approximation, which leads to

where C(θ0, β) = (β + 1)/(βζθ0)β/β+1, with ζ = λ2

β = 0, the measured proﬁle decays algebraically in accordance with Ref. [6, 7], while for an exponential PDF (β = 1),
its decay is exponential too. This implies that ion temperature ﬂuctuations characterized by an exponential PDF
would lead to a conspicuous behavior in the line wings. As an example, we consider the following temperature PDF

linear dependance characterizing an exponential fall oﬀ in log-linear scale is clearly seen. These results show that
Doppler line proﬁles would indeed be aﬀected by ion temperature ﬂuctuations stemming from passive advection.
Comparison to experimental spectra requires speciﬁcally designed measurements with a large dynamic range. With
existing techniques, spectra can be recorded over ﬁve orders of magnitude using CCD detectors operated in speciﬁcally
optimized readout mode [18]. In Ref.
[19], we presented spectra measured in the Tore Supra tokamak, the far line
wings of which were behaving in a way consistent with a power law. However, reliable determination of the exact
nature of the these deviations (exponential or power law behavior) would require improved measurements. In fact,
the latter spectra were obtained as a by-product of routine measurements, and therefore line wings were recorded only
over a limited range. These spectra nevertheless provided clear indications of the presence of an unexpected behavior
in the far line wings, and are a strong incentive for further investigations.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

We have shown that as a ﬁrst approximation the ion temperature ﬁeld in edge plasmas can be described as a
passive scalar, advected by the ﬂuctuating electric drift velocity ﬁeld. The average temperature gradient naturally
provides a forcing term for the ﬂuctuations. The PDF of the passive scalar can be calculated using results obtained
in neutral ﬂuids, and have an exponential fall oﬀ. The latter translates into an exponential fall oﬀ for Doppler line
wings. Therefore, passive spectroscopy might provide information on the statistical properties of ion temperature
ﬂuctuations, about which very few is known at this time. The eﬀects on Doppler line shapes are observable when the
temperature ﬂuctuation PDF deviates signiﬁcantly from gaussianity, so that their study could either uncover, or rule
out such behavior. This work also provides a strong incentive to study the statistical properties of ion temperature

ﬂuctuations by direct numerical simulation. This would allow to compare the PDF obtained numerically to those
provided by our simpliﬁed model.

A new formulation for collisional kinetic theory is presented based on the use of Lie-
transform methods to eliminate fast orbital time scales from a general bilinear collision
operator. As an application of this new formalism, a general guiding-center bilinear Fokker-

that classical transport processes in a strongly magnetized nonuniform plasma can, thus,
be described in terms of this reduced guiding-center FP kinetic theory. The present paper
introduces the reduced-collision formalism only while its applications are left to future
work.

I. INTRODUCTION

Lie-transform perturbation methods are normally associated with the asymptotic elim-
ination of fast time scales from single-particle Hamilton equations [1, 2]. In the present
paper, the general rules for the transformation of an arbitrary bilinear collision operator
are presented in terms of Lie-transform methods.

As a ﬁrst step, Lie-transform methods are used to eliminate a fast orbital time scale
from the collisionless (Vlasov) part of a collisional kinetic equation. As a result of this
elimination, the collision operator is transformed into a new collision operator in which
the fast time-scale dependence is still present. To eliminate this residual fast-time-scale
dependence, we proceed with a second step involving a closure scheme based on a time-
scale ordering involving the characteristic collisional time scale. A reduced collisional kinetic
equation is, therefore, obtained in which the fast-angle-averaged distribution evolves in a
reduced phase space.

By using Lie-transform methods, we obtain simpler and more compact expressions
for transformed guiding-center Fokker-Planck (FP) collision operators (for uniform and
nonuniform magnetic ﬁelds) when compared to those obtained by the standard approach
for uniform magnetic ﬁelds [3, 4]. The present approach is expected to be appropriate
appropriate for applications in collisional gyrokinetic theory and gyrokinetic particle sim-
ulations [5, 6].

A. Brief Introduction to Collisional Plasma Kinetic Theory

We begin with a brief introduction of collisional plasma kinetic theory (see Refs. [7]-[9],
for example). The study of irreversible transport processes in nonuniform plasmas is based
on solutions of a collisional plasma kinetic equation

where f is the test-particle distribution function and z are coordinates in the six-dimensional
single-particle phase space. The Vlasov operator

characterizes the dissipationless time evolution of f , where the Hamiltonian particle orbit
z(t; z0) is the solution of the Hamilton equations ˙zα(z, t) ≡ {zα, h(z, t)} with the initial
condition z0; here, h and { , } are the single-particle Hamiltonian and Poisson bracket,

respectively.

In the absence of collisions (C ≡ 0), Eq. (1) is the Vlasov equation [10]: df (z, t)/dt = 0,
whose solution f (z, t) is constant along a Hamiltonian particle orbit. The collision operator

C[f ] ≡

C[f ; f ′]

(3)

X
in Eq. (1) characterizes the dissipative (irreversible) time evolution of f , where the bi-
linear collision operator C[f ; f ′] describes binary collisions between test-particles and ﬁeld-
particles (with distribution f ′); the summation is over all ﬁeld-particle species (and includes
like-particle collisions).

Solutions of the collisional kinetic equation (1) are quite diﬃcult to obtain in general
and various approximation schemes must be adopted in order to arrive at useful solu-
tions. One such approximation scheme involves removing fast orbital time scales associ-
ated with Hamiltonian particle orbits in six-dimensional phase space [11]. Here, the mo-
tion of magnetically-conﬁned charged particles exhibits three distinct orbital time scales
(τg ≪ τb ≪ τd): (1) a fast gyration time scale τg associated with the gyromotion of charged
particles about a magnetic ﬁeld line; (2) an intermediate bounce time scale τb associated
with the periodic parallel motion of charged particle along a magnetic ﬁeld line; and (3)
a slow drift time scale τd associated with the perpendicular motion of charged particles
across nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld lines.

After choosing a slow time scale of interest (labeled τ ), we identify all fast time scales τk
which satisfy the condition τk ≪ τ . For example, if we are interested in plasma dynamics on
the bounce time scale (τ ∼ τb) then the gyromotion time scale is considered fast (τg ≪ τ )
and it can be asymptotically removed. For each such fast orbital time scale τk, a pair
of action-angle variables (Jk, θk) is assigned: θk is the fast angle variable (with ˙θk ≡ Ωk
denoting the fast orbital frequency) and its canonically-conjugate action Jk is an adiabatic
˙Jk is
invariant on a time scale longer than τk ≡
zero). The asymptotic elimination of a fast orbital time scale τk from the Vlasov operator
H
(2) can be carried out to arbitrary order in the small parameter ǫk ≡ ω/Ωk ≪ 1 (where
i ∂τ → ω denotes a characteristic frequency) [1, 12].

dθk/Ωk (i.e., the fast-angle average of

In the present paper, we focus our attention on the asymptotic elimination of the gy-
romotion time scale leading to the reduced guiding-center dynamics of charged particles in
nonuniform magnetic ﬁelds. Here, the reduced guiding-center coordinates (X, E, µ, θ) in-
clude the guiding-center position X, the guiding-center kinetic energy E, the guiding-center
magnetic moment µ, and the guiding-center gyro-angle θ. Each coordinate is expressed as
an asymptotic expansion in powers of the dimensionless parameter ǫB = ρ/LB [13, 14, 15],
where ρ is the characteristic gyroradius of a charged particle and LB denotes the magnetic
ﬁeld nonuniformity length scale.

B. Lie-transform Phase-space Transformations

The standard mathetical method used to asymptotically eliminate fast time scales is

3

the Lie-transform method, which we brieﬂy review here. In particular, we show the trans-
formation rules by which each element of the collisional kinetic equation (1) (i.e., f , d/dt,
and C) transform under a near-identity transformation.

Using Lie-transform methods [1], the process by which a fast time scale is removed from

Eq. (2) involves a near-identity transformation on particle phase space:

Tǫ : z → Z(z; ǫ) ≡ Tǫz, with Z(z; 0) = z,

(4)

where ǫ ≪ 1 is a small parameter (for reduced guiding-center dynamics, ǫ = ǫB). In what
follows, the new six-dimensional phase-space coordinates Z ≡ (ZR; J, θ) are divided into
the reduced phase-space coordinates ZR (the reduced particle dynamics takes place in a
four-dimensional space) and the fast canonical action-angle pair (J, θ).

Next, using the transformation (4), we deﬁne the push-forward operator on scalar ﬁelds

[1] induced by the near-identity transformation (4):

T−1
ǫ

: f → F ≡ T−1

ǫ f,

ǫ

i.e., T−1
F on the phase space with coordinates Z: F (Z) = T−1
transformation (4) is invertible, i.e., there exists an inverse near-identity transformation

transforms a scalar ﬁeld f on the phase space with coordinates z into a scalar ﬁeld
ǫ Z) = f (z). Since the

ǫ f (Z) = f (T −1

T −1
ǫ

: Z → z(Z; ǫ) ≡ T −1

ǫ Z, with z(Z; 0) = Z,

we also deﬁne the pull-back operator [1]:

Tǫ : F → f ≡ TǫF,

i.e., Tǫ transforms a scalar ﬁeld F on the phase space with coordinates Z into a scalar ﬁeld
f on the phase space with coordinates z: f (z) = TǫF (z) = F (Tǫz) = F (Z).

Lastly, we consider the transformation of a general operator L : f → Lf acting locally
on the particle distribution f such that Lf is also a scalar ﬁeld on particle phase space.
Hence, the induced transformation of the scalar ﬁeld Lf follows the push-forward rule
(5): Lf → T−1
ǫ Lf . By combining this push-forward transformation with the pull-back
transformation f = TǫF , we construct a new local operator Lǫ : F → LǫF deﬁned as

LǫF ≡ T−1

ǫ L

Tǫ F

.

(cid:17)

This induced transformation rule for operators will be used in the next Section to transform
the Vlasov operator d/dt and the collision operator C appearing in the collisional kinetic
equation (1).

C. Organization

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we investigate the fast-
time dependence of the transformed collisional kinetic equation and discover that, although

4

the fast time scale has been eliminated from the dissipationless (Vlasov) part of the kinetic
equation, the dissipative (collisional) part has retained fast-time dependence as a result
of collisions. This is not too surprising after all since these phase-space transformations
were never designed for that purpose. This means that the transformed collision operator
is not yet reduced in the sense that the fast-angle-independent (averaged) part hF i and
F = F − hF i of the transformed distribution function F
the fast-angle-dependent part
are still coupled by collisions. The reduction of the transformed collision operator involves
a closure scheme yielding a reduced collision operator acting on hF i alone. This closure
scheme is based on an asymptotic expansion based on a new expansion parameter ǫν =
ν/Ω = ρ/λν ≪ 1 deﬁned as the ratio of the characteristic collision frequency ν over the fast
frequency Ω or the ratio of the gyroradius ρ over the collisional mean-free-path λν. For most
practical applications, however, we argue that only the lowest term in this ǫν-expansion is
relevant.

e

The purpose of the present paper is, therefore, to derive ﬁrst-order (ǫB = ρ/LB) cor-
rections of a reduced guiding-center Fokker-Planck (FP) collision operator, which might
be suitable for analytical and numerical study of collisional and turbulent transport pro-
cesses in nonuniform magnetized plasmas. In Sec. III, we derive the lowest-order term in
a reduced Fokker-Planck (FP) collision operator. Starting from a standard FP collision
operator (describing collisional drag and diﬀusion in momentum space), we derive an ex-
pression for a reduced FP collision operator in a reduced (4 + 1) phase space. In particular,
the reduced FP collision operator describes spatial drag and diﬀusion processes normally
described from a collisional ﬂuid-moment approach.

As a speciﬁc example, we focus our attention in Sec. IV on the guiding-center phase-
space transformation associated with the asymptotic elimination of the fast gyro-motion
time scale of a charged particle moving in a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld. General expressions
are obtained for the collisional FP drag and diﬀusion coeﬃcients in guiding-center phase
space. For clarity of exposition, we also use an isotropic ﬁeld-particle model introduced
in Sec. II to investigate how magnetic-ﬁeld nonuniformity inﬂuences these guiding-center
FP coeﬃcients. We also discuss possible extensions of our work introduced by background
nonuniform electric ﬁelds (which are outside the scope of the present work) and summarize
our ﬁndings in Sec. V. Lastly, we present some technical details about the guiding-center
transformation for nonuniform magnetic ﬁelds in Appendix A.

II. TRANSFORMED COLLISIONAL KINETIC EQUATION

The transformation of the collisional kinetic equation (1), induced by the near-identity

phase-space transformation (4), yields a new collisional kinetic equation:

C[TǫF ; Tǫ′F ′]
(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(Z, t),

where ǫ′ ≡ ω/Ω′ is the small parameter associated with the ﬁeld-particle species. We
note that the bilinearity of the collision operator (3) allows a separate treatment of the
test-particle (f ) and ﬁeld-particle (f ′) distributions and, for convenience of notation, we,
henceforth, write the transformed collision operator (11) as

Cǫ[F ](Z, t) ≡ T−1

ǫ

(C[TǫF ]) (Z, t),

and omit mention of the ﬁeld-particle species unless otherwise needed.

The transformed Vlasov operator (10) is now explicitly written in terms of the new

phase-space coordinates (ZR; J, θ) as

(Z).

(cid:16)
We note that the transformed Hamiltonian H(ZR; J) and the transformed Poisson bracket
{ , }ǫ are (by construction) independent of the fast angle θ, so that Hamilton’s equations
˙ZR(ZR; J) and ˙θ = Ω(ZR; J) – and, thus, the transformed Vlasov operator dǫ/dt – are
independent of the fast angle θ while ˙J ≡ 0 (to all orders in ǫ).

(cid:17)

The θ-independence of the transformed Vlasov operator (13) allows the separation of
the transformed collisional kinetic equation (9) into two coupled kinetic equations: one for
the θ-averaged distribution, denoted hF i, and one for the θ-dependent distribution, denoted
F ≡ F − hF i. The collisional kinetic equation for hF i is obtained by θ-averaging both sides
of Eq. (9):
e

hF i = hCǫ[F ]i ≡ hCǫ[hF i]i +

Cǫ[

F ]

,

(15)

where we used the θ-independence of the reduced Vlasov operator dR/dt on the left side
F is obtained by subtracting Eq. (15)
of Eq. (15), while the collisional kinetic equation for

Note that the term hCǫ[
F ]i in Eq. (15) does not vanish in general and, thus, the collisional
kinetic equations (15) and (16) are coupled through collisions (i.e., when C = 0, it can be
F = 0 to all orders in ǫ). Hence, Eq. (15) still contains a dependence on the

The ultimate goal in reduced collisional kinetic theory is to transform Eq. (15) into a

The reduced collisional kinetic equation (17), including the reduced collision operator
(23), is obtained from the collisional kinetic equation (9) as a result of two asymptotic
expansions in powers of ǫ and ǫν. In most practical applications, however, the zeroth-order
expression (24) is suﬃcient and, thus, we, henceforth, focus on applications of this lowest-
order term in the development of reduced collisional kinetic theories. We note that the
two small parameters ǫB and ǫν introduced above serve very diﬀerent purposes: ǫB = ρ/LB
is involved in the elimination of fast gyro-motion time scale from the Vlasov operator
and ǫν = ν/Ω = ρ/λν is involved in the elimination of fast gyro-motion time scale from
the collision operator. The ratio of these two dimensionless parameters introduces a new
parameter

in the collisional kinetic theory of irreversible transport processes in nonuniform magnetized
plasmas [8]. According to neoclassical collisional kinetic theory [8], for example, the classical
collisional regime is identiﬁed by the condition ∆ ≪ 1, i.e., the collisional mean-free-path is
much shorter than the magnetic nonuniformity length scale, so that magnetic nonuniformity
can be ignored at the lowest order in ǫB. In the neoclassical regime, on the other hand,
we may have ∆ ≥ 1 (i.e., λν ≥ LB) while in the collisionless regime, we have ∆ ≫ 1
(i.e., λν ≫ LB). In the latter two cases, the motion of a guiding-center particle explores a
signiﬁcant portion of the magnetic ﬁeld nonuniformity before it encounters a collision.

III. TRANSFORMED FOKKER-PLANCK COLLISION OPERATOR

The collisional operator C has so far been treated as an arbitrary bilinear collision
operator. We now focus our attention on an important class of bilinear collision operators
used in plasma physics: the Fokker–Planck (FP) collision operators (see, for example,
Refs. [9, 16, 17]). The general form of the FP collision operator is expressed as

CFP[f ](x, p) ≡ −

K i(x, p) f (x, p) − Dij(x, p)

∂
∂pi "

∂f
∂pj (x, p)

,

#

(26)

where z ≡ (x, p) are phase-space coordinates for a test-particle of mass m and charge
e (here, x denotes the particle position and p = mv its kinetic momentum); the time
dependence is suppressed for simplicity of notation and the momentum representation is
used to facilitate the analysis that follows. The collision operator (26) describes momentum-
space scattering events in both unmagnetized plasmas [16] and magnetized plasmas [17, 18]:
′ K[f ′] describes collisional momentum drag while the
the three-component vector K =
′ D[f ′] describes collisional momentum diﬀusion;
three-by-three symmetric matrix D =
the coeﬃcients K[f ′] and D[f ′] are functionals of the ﬁeld-particle distribution function f ′.

For small-angle-deﬂection Coulomb collisions in an unmagnetized plasma involving test-
particle species a and ﬁeld-particle species b [8], for example, the coeﬃcients Kab[fb] and

operators can also be expressed in terms of Rosenbluth potentials [17, 18]. However, the
unmagnetized FP collision operator (26) can still be used to study collisional transport
processes in magnetized plasmas if the characteristic gyroradius is larger than the Debye
length for each plasma particle species (i.e., the Alfven speed is sub-luminal for each plasma
particle species), which is well satisﬁed for electrons and ions in high-temperature tokamak
plasmas.

where we have used standard properties of the push-forward operator T−1: T−1(f g) =
(T−1f ) (T−1g). Note that, because the transformed FP collision operator (29) is written in
divergence form, it is guaranteed to satisfy the particle conservation property.

Although the standard transformation procedure (29) is straightforward to apply for ﬁ-
nite transformations [11] (e.g., transformation from Cartesian to cylindrical momentum co-
ǫ /∂pi)
ordinates), the explicit calculation of the transformation-matrix components T−1
can be diﬃcult to implement in practice for near-identity transformations on six-dimensional
phase space, such as those contemplated in the present work. The diﬃculty resides in the
ǫ /∂pi) in Eqs. (30)-( 31) involve a double asymptotic expansion
fact that the terms T−1

collision operator (26) based on the use of the noncanonical Poisson bracket { , } used in
describing single-particle Hamiltonian dynamics.

(33)

where f and g are two arbitrary phase-space functions and the magnetic ﬁeld B appears in
Eq. (33) because p = mv is not the canonical momentum. Note also that, from Eq. (28),
ab = {xi, Hab} and Dij
the Fokker-Planck coeﬃcients K i
2 {xi, {xj, Gab} } can also
be expressed in terms of Poisson brackets of the Rosenbluth potentials, where we use the
Jacobi identity for Poisson brackets and the fact that {xi, xj} = 0 to verify that Dij
ab is
symmetric.

ab = 1

Next, using the transformed Poisson bracket (14), the transformed FP collision operator

is obtained from Eq. (12) as

In the next Section, we derive expressions for the guiding-center Fokker-Planck collision
operator based on the general phase-space divergence form (37), with coeﬃcients given by
Eqs. (38) and (39).

IV. REDUCED GUIDING-CENTER FOKKER-PLANCK OPERATOR

As an application of the Poisson-bracket formalism presented in Sec. III.B, we consider
the transformation of a general FP collision operator under the guiding-center transforma-
tion [14]: z = (x, p) → Z = (X, E; µ, θ), where X denotes the guiding-center position, E
denotes the guiding-center kinetic energy (E = p2
k/2m + µB), µ denotes the guiding-center
magnetic moment, and θ denotes the guiding-center gyroangle. The choice of the actual
velocity-space guiding-center coordinates used in the guiding-center FP collision operator

11

can vary depending on its applications; here, we use the (E, µ) coordinates because of the
simplicity of the derived guiding-center FP collision operator and future work will consider
replacing the magnetic moment µ with the guiding-center’s pitch angle ξ = arccos(pk/p).

A. Nonuniform Magnetic Field

In the collisionless regime ∆ = ǫB/ǫν = λν/LB ≫ 1 (where the collisional mean-free-
path λν is much longer than the magnetic nonuniformity length scale LB), the guiding-
center motion of a charged particle samples a signiﬁcant portion of the magnetic-ﬁeld
nonuniformity before it encounters a collision and, thus, magnetic ﬁeld nonuniformity be-
comes important when describing the collision process.

According to the guiding-center transformation [14, 15], the particle position

x = X + ρǫ ≡ Xǫ

(41)

(42)

is expressed in terms of the guiding-center position X and the gyroradius vector ρǫ (whose
expression includes corrections due to magnetic-ﬁeld nonuniformity); the dimensionless
parameter ǫ = ǫB represents the magnetic ﬁeld nonuniformity. The expression for the
gyroradius vector (up to order ǫ)

B. Guiding-center Fokker-Planck Collision Operator

We now proceed with obtaining general expressions for the phase-space collisional drag
vector (38) and the phase-space collisional diﬀusion tensor (39) associated with the guiding-
center transformation (x, p) → (X, E, µ, θ). First, using the deﬁnition (40) for ∆α

contains spatial derivatives and, therefore, Eq. (52) describes spatial collisional drag and
spatial collisional diﬀusion.

1. Guiding-center collisional drag vector

The gyroangle-averaged spatial components of the guiding-center collisional drag vector

needed for the lowest-order guiding-center FP collision operator (24) are

where the remaining terms are of second order in ǫB and are, therefore, omitted. The
gyroangle-averaged energy and magnetic-moment components, on the other hand, are

We note that the components (54)-(55) of the guiding-center phase-space collisional drag
vector are non-vanishing in the absence of magnetic nonuniformity and, thus, magnetic
nonuniformity adds only corrections to these components. We expect the spatial compo-
nents (53) of the guiding-center phase-space collisional drag vector, on the other hand, to
vanish in the absence of magnetic nonuniformity as will be demonstrated when we apply
the isotropic-ﬁeld-particle model (28) to the formulas presented in this Section.

Once again we note that the components (56)-(59) of the guiding-center phase-space col-
lisional diﬀusion tensor are non-vanishing in the absence of magnetic nonuniformity and,
thus, magnetic nonuniformity only adds small corrections to these components. We expect
the spatial components (60)-(61) of the guiding-center phase-space collisional diﬀusion ten-
sor, on the other hand, to vanish in the absence of magnetic nonuniformity.

C. Isotropic Field-Particle Model

To obtain a speciﬁc expression for a guiding-center FP collision operator (52) and
investigate how a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld aﬀects the form of the FP collision operator,
we now consider the case of an isotropic ﬁeld-particle (IFP) distribution [see Eq. (28)], for
which the transformed collisional drag vector and the collisional diﬀusion tensor are

where νǫ, Dkǫ, and D⊥ǫ are calculated from Rosenbluth potentials and are assumed to
depend only on the guiding-center energy E (to lowest order in spatial nonuniformity) for
simplicity of presentation.

From Eqs. (62)-(63) and (47), we obtain the IFP identities

Kǫ · pǫ = − νǫ 2mE and pǫ · Dǫ · pǫ = pǫ · (Dkǫ pǫ) = Dkǫ 2mE,

(64)

and the gyroangle-averaged expressions

We now substitute Eqs. (62)-(63) and (65)-(66) to obtain explicit expressions for the
guiding-center FP coeﬃcients (53)-(61).

which are unaﬀected by magnetic-ﬁeld nonuniformity as a result of the fact that the guiding-
center and particle kinetic energies are equal to each other up to ﬁrst order in ǫB [see
Eq. (A.2)]. Next, using the gyroangle-averaged expressions (65), the guiding-center FP

V. SUMMARY

In summary, we have derived a general reduced Fokker-Planck kinetic equation by Lie-
transform methods. The collisional kinetic equation (17) was obtained as a result of two
independent asymptotic expansions: the ﬁrst expansion (with small parameter ǫ = ω/Ω)
was associated with the elimination of the fast time scale from the Vlasov operator; while
the second expansion (with small parameter ǫν = ν/Ω) was associated with the elimination
of the fast time scale from the transformed collision operator.

As an application of the dynamical reduction formalism for bilinear collision operators,
we derived a general guiding-center Fokker-Planck collision operator (52), with coeﬃcients
given in compact form by Eqs. (53)-(61). In order to show explicitly how magnetic-ﬁeld
nonuniformity aﬀects the form of the guiding-center FP collision operator, we also made
use of the simple isotropic-ﬁeld-particle model (28) and obtained explicit expressions for the
guiding-center FP coeﬃcients (67)-( 72). In this simpliﬁed model, the eﬀects of magnetic-
ﬁeld nonuniformity are represented by the gyroangle-averaged guiding-center velocity vgc
and the guiding-center vorticity parameter λgc.

Although background electric ﬁelds were omitted in the present work (for simplicity),
we now discuss extensions of the present work associated with the inclusion of background
electric ﬁelds (with separate orderings in the core and edge regions of magnetized fusion
plasmas with sheared ﬂows). Eﬀects associated with a background electric ﬁeld introduce a
modiﬁcation of the averaged guiding-center velocity to include background E × B velocity
vE = cE ×
b/B. Although guiding-center magnetic-drift eﬀects are small (i.e., of order ǫB)
compared to the characteristic thermal speeds of plasma particles, an additional ordering
is required for the background E × B velocity, which falls outside the scope of this work.
We can, however, predict how the eﬀects of a background electric ﬁeld might appear in
b × vgc in the spatial components (69) and (72) is replaced with
the IFP model. The term
b × (vgc + vE) while the term λgc in the velocity-space components (70) is replaced with
b/Ω) · ∇ × vE, where the second term is analogous to the orbit-squeezing eﬀect of
λgc + (
b
edge electric ﬁelds. Future work will investigate the role played by background electric
ﬁelds, which are relevant to the numerical gyrokinetic simulations of edge plasmas [20].

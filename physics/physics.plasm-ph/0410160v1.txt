Abstract

A case study in bifurcation and stability analysis is presented, in which reduced dy-
namical system modelling yields substantial new global and predictive information about
the behaviour of a complex system. The ﬁrst smooth pathway, free of pathological and
persistent degenerate singularities, is surveyed through the parameter space of a nonlin-
ear dynamical model for a gradient-driven, turbulence–shear ﬂow energetics in magnetized
fusion plasmas. Along the route various obstacles and features are identiﬁed and treated
appropriately. An organizing centre of low codimension is shown to be robust, several
trapped singularities are found and released, and domains of hysteresis, threefold stable
equilibria, and limit cycles are mapped. Characterization of this rich dynamical landscape
achieves uniﬁcation of previous disparate models for plasma conﬁnement transitions, sup-
plies valuable intelligence on the big issue of shear ﬂow suppression of turbulence, and
suggests targeted experimental design, control and optimization strategies.

1.

Introduction

The collective dynamics of complex distributed systems often can be usefully described in terms
of a superposition of rate processes or frequencies which determine the changes in macroscop-
ically measurable variables as energy ﬂows through the system; that is, a dynamical model
expressed as a system of coupled ordinary differential equations in a few averaged state vari-
ables or mode coefﬁcients and several, independently tunable, parameters that represent phys-
ical properties or external controls. This type of reduced (or low-order or low-dimensional)
modelling averages over space, mode spectrum structure, single-particle dynamics and other
details, but the payoff lies in its amenity to sophisticated analytic theory and methods that en-
able us to track important qualitative features in the collective dynamics, such as singularities,
bifurcations, and stability changes, broadly over the parameter space.

Motivated by the need for improved guidance and control of the (mostly bad) behaviour
of fusion plasmas in magnetic containers, I elaborate in this work a case study in bifurcation
and stability analysis in which reduced dynamical system modelling yields new global and
predictive information about gradient driven turbulence–ﬂow energetics that is complementary
to direct numerical simulation and can guide experimental design.

Complex 2004

Reduced dynamical models are powerful tools for describing and analysing complex sys-
tems such as turbulent plasmas and ﬂuids, primarily because they are supported by well-developed
mathematics that gives qualitative and global insight, such as singularity, bifurcation, stability,
and symmetry theory. In principle one can map analytically the bifurcation structure of the en-
tire phase and parameter space of a reduced dynamical system, but this feat is not possible for
an inﬁnite-dimensional system, or partial differential equations, and not practicable for systems
of high order1. The usefulness of such models seems to be no coincidence, too: in turbulent
systems generally, which in detail are both complex and complicated, the dynamics seems to
take place in a low-dimensional subspace (Holmes et al., 1996).

It seems paradoxical that enthusiasm for low-dimensional modelling and qualitative analysis
of ﬂuid and plasma systems has paced the ever larger direct numerical simulations of their ﬂow
ﬁelds. This is an exemplar of how the simplexity and complicity (Cohen and Stewart, 1994)
juxtaposition can work well: these methods afﬁrm each other, for both have common ground
in the universal conservation equations for ﬂuid ﬂow (as well as separate bases in mathematics
and computational science). Developments in one feed developments in the other. Reduced
dynamical models can give insights into the physics and dynamics of a system in a way that is
complementary to brute-force numerical simulations of the detailed, spatially distributed mod-
els from which they are derived. In practice this complementarity means that low-order models
(which capture few or no spatial modes) can be used to channel information gleaned from the
generic, qualitative structure of the parameter space — attractors, critical points of onset, sta-
bility properties, and so on — to numerical simulations (which contain all spatial modes but, on
their own, bring little physical understanding), giving them purpose and meaning. In turn the
ﬂuid simulations serve as virtual experiments to validate the low-order approach.

It is reasonable, therefore, to assert that improved low-dimensional dynamical models for
plasmas and ﬂuids could provide numerical experimenters with new and interesting challenges
that will continue to push the limits of computational science and technology.

1.1 Two-dimensional ﬂuid motion in plasmas

Fusion plasmas in magnetic containers, such as those in tokamak or stellarator experiments,
are strongly driven nonequilibrium systems in which the kinetic energy of small-scale turbu-
lent ﬂuctuations can drive the formation of large-scale coherent structures such as shear and
zonal ﬂows. This inherent tendency to self-organize is a striking characteristic of ﬂows where
Lagrangian ﬂuid elements see a predominantly two-dimensional velocity ﬁeld, and is a con-
sequence of the inverse energy cascade (Kraichnan and Montgomery, 1980). The distinctive
properties of quasi two-dimensional ﬂuid motion are the basis of natural phenomena such as
zonal and coherent structuring of planetary ﬂows, but are generally under-exploited in technol-
ogy.

In plasmas the most potentially useful effect of two-dimensional ﬂuid motion is suppression
of high wavenumber turbulence that generates cross-ﬁeld transport ﬂuxes and degrades con-
ﬁnement (Terry, 2000). Suppression of turbulent transport can manifest temporally as a sponta-
neous and more-or-less abrupt enhancement of sheared poloidal or zonal ﬂows and concomitant

qualitative theories.

Complex 2004

damping of density ﬂuctuations, and spatially as the rapid development of a localized transport
barrier or steep density gradient. The phenomenon is often called low- to high-conﬁnement
(L–H) transitions and has been the subject of intensive experimental, in numero, and theoretical
and modelling investigations since the 1980s.

1.2 Conﬁnement transitions and reduced dynamical systems

The large and lively primary literature on reduced dynamical models for conﬁnement transitions
and associated oscillations in plasmas represents a sort of consensus on the philosophy behind
qualitative analysis, if not on the details of the models themselves. What motivates this approach
is the predictive power that a uniﬁed, low-order description of the macroscopic dynamics would
have in the management of conﬁnement states. Since it is widely acknowledged that control of
turbulent transport is crucial to the success of the world-wide fusion energy program (U.S.
DoE, 2000; Fujisawa et al., 2000) it is important to develop predictive models for efﬁcient
management of access to, and sustainment of, high conﬁnement r´egimes. For example, if one
plans to maintain a high conﬁnement state at a relatively low power input by exploiting the
hysteresis in the transition it would be useful, not to mention cheaper, to know in advance
which parameters control the shape and extent of hysteresis, or whether it can exist at all in the
operating space of a particular system, or whether a transition will be oscillatory.

However, it has been shown (Ball and Dewar, 2000; Ball and Dewar, 2001; Ball et al.,
2002) that many of the models in the literature are structurally ﬂawed. They often contain
pathological or persistent degenerate (higher order) singularities. An associated issue is that of
overdetermination, where near a persistent degenerate singularity there may be more deﬁning
equations than variables. Consequently much of the discussion in the literature concerning
conﬁnement transitions is qualitatively wrong. Such models cannot possibly have predictive
power.

The heart of the matter lies in the mapping between the bifurcation structure and stability
properties of a dynamical model and the physics of the process it is supposed to represent: if
we probe this relationship we ﬁnd that degenerate singularities ought to correspond to some
essential physics (such as fulﬁlling a symmetry-breaking imperative, or the onset of hysteresis),
or they are pathological. In the ﬁrst case we can usually unfold the singularity in a physically
meaningful way; in the other case we know that something is amiss and we should revise our
assumptions. Degenerate singularities are good because they provide opportunities to improve
a model and its predictive capabilities, but bad when they are not recognized as such.

The literature on conﬁnement transitions has two basic strands: (1) Transitions are an internal,
quasi two-dimensional ﬂow, phenomenon and occur spontaneously when the rate of upscale
transfer of kinetic energy from turbulence to shear and zonal ﬂows exceeds the nonlinear dis-
sipation rate (Diamond et al., 1992); (2) Transitions are due to nonambipolar ion orbit losses
near the plasma edge, the resulting electric ﬁeld providing a torque which drives the poloidal
shear ﬂow nonlinearly (Itoh and Itoh, 1988; Shaing and Crume, 1989; Stringer, 1993). These

Complex 2004

two different views of the physics behind conﬁnement transitions are smoothly reconciled for
the ﬁrst time in this work.

A systematic methodology for characterizing the equilibria of dynamical systems involves
ﬁnding and classifying high-order singularities then perturbing around them to explore and map
the bifurcation landscape (Golubitsky and Schaeffer, 1985). Broadly, this paper is about apply-
ing singularity theory as a diagnostic tool while an impasto picture of conﬁnement transition
dynamics is compounded. The bare-bones model is presented in section 2. In section 3. the
global consequences of local symmetry-breaking are explored, leading to the discovery of an
organizing centre and trapped degenerate singularities. This leads in to section 4. where I unfold
a trapped singularity smoothly by introducing another layer that models the neglected physics
of downscale energy transfer. Section 5. follows the qualitative changes to the bifurcation and
stability structure that are due to potential energy dissipative losses. In section 6. the uniﬁed
model is presented, in which is included a direct channel between gradient potential energy and
shear ﬂow kinetic energy. The results and conclusions are summarized in section 7.

2. The basic model comprises three energy subsystems

In the edge region of a plasma conﬁnement experiment such as a tokamak or stellarator poten-
tial energy is stored in a steep pressure gradient which is fed by a power source near the centre.
Gradient potential energy P is converted to turbulent kinetic energy N, which is drawn off into
stable shear ﬂows, with kinetic energy F , and dissipation channels. The energetics of this sim-
plest picture of conﬁnement transition dynamics are schematized in Fig. 1(a). (Nomenclature
for the quantities here and in the rest of the paper is deﬁned in Table 1.)

A skeleton dynamical system for this overall process can be written down directly from

sure convection equations in slab geometry, using an electrostatic approximation to eliminate
the dynamics of the magnetic ﬁeld energy. Equations 1 are ﬂeshed out by substituting speciﬁc

processes are not usually derivable purely from theory, and ultimately must be tested against

The rest of this paper is concerned with the character of the equilibria of Eqs 2 and mod-
iﬁcations and extensions to this system. We shall study the type, multiplicity, and stability of
attractors, interrogate degenerate or pathological singularities where they appear, and classify
and map the bifurcation structure of the system. In doing this we shall attempt to answer ques-

tions such as: Are Eqs 2 or modiﬁed versions a good — that is, predictive — model of the
system? Does the model adequately reﬂect the known phenomenology of conﬁnement tran-
sitions in fusion plasmas? What is the relationship between the bifurcation properties of the
model and the physics of conﬁnement transitions?

The equilibrium solutions of Eqs 2 are shown in the bifurcation diagrams of Fig. 2, where
the shear ﬂow v′ is chosen as the state variable and the power input Q is chosen as the principal
bifurcation or control parameter. (In these and subsequent bifurcation diagrams stable equilibria
are indicated by solid lines and unstable equilibria are indicated by dashed lines.) Several
bifurcation or singular points are evident.

The four points in (a) annotated by asterisks, where the stability of solutions changes, are

Hopf bifurcations to limit cycles, which are discussed in section 3.2.

On the line v′ = 0 the singularity P is found to satisfy the deﬁning and non-degeneracy

conditions for a pitchfork,

G = Gζ = Gζζ = Gλ = 0, Gζζζ 6

= 0,

(3)

where G is the bifurcation equation derived from the zeros of Eqs 2, ζ represents the chosen state
variable, λ represents the chosen control or principal bifurcation parameter, and the subscripts
denote partial derivatives. In the qualitatively different bifurcation diagrams (a) and (b) the
dissipative parameter β is relaxed either side of the critical value given in (c), where the perfect,
twice-degenerate pitchfork is represented. Thus for β < βcrit (a poorly dissipative system) the
turning points in (a) appear and the system may also show oscillatory behaviour. The dynamics
are less interesting for β > βcrit (a highly dissipative system) as in (b) because the turning
points, and perhaps also the Hopf bifurcations, cannot occur.

However, P is persistent through variations in β or any other parameter in Eqs 2. (This fact
was not recognized in some previous models for conﬁnement transitions, where such points

Complex 2004

were wrongly claimed to represent second-order phase transitions.) Typically the pitchfork
is associated with a fragile symmetry in the dynamics of the modelled physical system. The
symmetry in this case is obvious from Fig. 2:
in principle the shear ﬂow can be in either
direction equally. In real life (or in numero), experiments are always subject to perturbations
that determine a preferred direction for the shear ﬂow, and the pitchfork is inevitably dissolved.
In this case the perturbation is an effective force or torque from any asymmetric shear-inducing
mechanism, such as friction with neutrals in the plasma or external sources, and acts as a shear
ﬂow driving rate. Assuming this rate to be small and independent of the variables over the
characteristic timescales for the other rate processes in the system, we may revise the shear
ﬂow evolution Eq. 2c as

where the symmetry-breaking term ϕ models the shear ﬂow drive. The corresponding energy

A bifurcation diagram where P is fully unfolded, that is, for ϕ
Fig. 3. This diagram is rich with information that speaks of the known and predicted dynamics
of the system and of ways in which the model can be improved further, and which cannot be
inferred or detected from the degenerate bifurcation diagrams of Fig. 2. It is worthwhile to step
through Fig. 3 in detail, with the energy schema Fig. 1 (b) at hand. Let us begin on the stable
branch at Q

= 0 and β

0.1.

Here the pressure gradient is being charged up, the gradient potential energy is feeding the
turbulence, and the shear ﬂow is small but positive because the sign of the perturbation ϕ is
positive. As the power input Q is increased quasistatically the shear ﬂow begins to grow but
at the turning point, where solutions become unstable, there is a discontinuous transition to the
upper stable branch in v′ and P , (a) and (b), and to the lower stable branch in N, (c). At the
given value of β the hysteresis is evident: if we backtrack a little the back transition takes place
at a lower value of Q. Continuing along the upper stable branch in v′ we encounter another
switch in stability; this time at a Hopf bifurcation to stable period one limit cycles. (In this and
other diagrams the amplitude envelopes of limit cycle branches are marked by large solid dots.)

From the amplitude envelope we see that the oscillations grow as power is fed to the system
then are extinguished rather abruptly, at a second Hopf bifurcation where the solutions regain
stability. The shear ﬂow decreases toward zero as the pressure-dependent anomalous viscosity,
the second term in Eq. 2d, takes over to dissipate the energy at high power input.
The system may also be evolved to an equilibrium on the antisymmetric,

v′ branch in
Fig. 3 (a), by choosing initial conditions2 appropriately or a large enough kick. However, if the
power input then falls below the turning point at (v′, Q)
0.9, 0.46) we see an interesting
phenomenon: the shear ﬂow spontaneously reverses direction. The transient would nominally
take the system toward the nearest stable attractor, the lower +v′ branch, but since it would then
be sitting very close to the lower +v′ turning point small stochastic ﬂuctuations could easily
induce the transition to the higher +v′ branch. See the inset zoom-in over this region in (a).
Here is an example of a feature that is unusual in bifurcation landscapes, a domain over which
there is ﬁvefold multiplicity comprising three stable and two unstable equilibria. Two more
examples of threefold stable domains will be shown in section 5.

In the remainder of this paper I concentrate on the +v′ branches and ignore the

the one for which the initial conditions lie within its basin of attraction. The overall bifurcation structure of the
type of dynamical system considered here is independent of initial conditions.

3.3 A metamorphosis of the dynamics

Now we approach the very heart of the model, the organizing centre; strangely enough via the
branch of unstable solutions that is just evident in Fig. 3 (a) and (b) in the top left-hand corner
and (c) in the lower left hand corner. The effects of symmetry-breaking are more far-reaching
than merely providing a local universal unfolding of the pitchfork, for this branch of equilibria
was trapped as a singularity at (v′, Q) = (

described as a metamorphosis in Ball (2002), can be encountered by varying ϕ. The sequence

The “new” unstable branch develops a Hopf bifurcation at the turning point. (Strictly speak-
ing, this is a degenerate Hopf bifurcation, called DZE, where a pair of complex conjugate eigen-
values have zero real and imaginary components.) As ϕ is tuned up to 0.08 (a) a segment of
stable solutions becomes apparent as the Hopf bifurcation moves away from the turning point;
the associated small branch of limit cycles can also just be seen. At ϕT M , the metamorphosis,
the “new” and “old” branches exchange arms, (b).

The metamorphosis satisﬁes the conditions (5) and is therefore an unusual, non-symmetric,
transcritical bifurcation. It signals a profound change in the type of dynamics that the system
is capable of. For ϕ > ϕT M a transition must still occur at the lower limit point, but there is
no classical hysteresis, (c) and (d). In fact classical hysteresis is (locally) forbidden by the non-

degeneracy condition Gζζ 6

a completely non-hysteretic transition, a forward transition to a stable steady state and a back
transition from a large period limit cycle, or forward and back transitions occurring to and from
a limit cycle.

3.4 The story so far

The symmetry-broken model comprises Eqs 2a, 2b, and 4, with 2d. The bifurcation structure,
some of which is depicted in Figs 3 and 4, predicts various behaviours:

Shear ﬂow suppression of turbulence;

Smooth, hysteretic, non-hysteretic, and oscillatory transitions;

Spontaneous and kicked reversals in direction of shear ﬂow;

Saturation then decrease of the shear ﬂow with power input due to pressure-dependent
anomalous viscosity;

A metamorphosis of the dynamics through a transcritical bifurcation.

A critical appraisal of experimental evidence that supports the qualitative structure of this model
is given in Ball (2004). With the exception of the last item all of the above dynamics have been
observed in magnetically contained fusion plasma systems. The model would therefore seem
to be a “good” and “complete” one, in the sense of being free of pathological or persistent
degenerate singularities and reﬂecting observed behaviours.

However, there are several outstanding issues that suggest the model is still incomplete. One
issue arises as a gremlin in the bifurcation structure that makes an unphysical prediction, another
comes from a thermal diffusivity term that was regarded as negligible in previous work on this
model. A third issue arises from the two strands in literature on the physics of conﬁnement
transitions: the model as it stands does not describe conﬁnement transitions due to a nonlinear
electric ﬁeld drive.

4. Shear ﬂows also generate turbulence

The ﬁrst issue of incompleteness concerns a pathology in the bifurcation structure of the model,
implying inﬁnite growth of shear ﬂow as the power input falls. Before we pinpoint the culprit
singularity, it is illuminating to evince the physical — or unphysical — situation through a
study of the role of the thermal capacitance parameter ε, which regulates the contribution of the
pressure gradient dynamics, Eq. 2a, to the oscillatory dynamics of the system. Conveniently,
we can use ε as a second parameter to examine the stability of steady-state solutions around the
Hopf bifurcations in Fig. 4 without quantitative change. The machinery for this study consists

1. The high-capacitance r´egime:

The maximum on the curve in Fig. 5 marks a degenerate Hopf bifurcation, a DZE point.
Here the two Hopf bifurcations at lower Q in Fig. 4(c) merge and are extinguished as
ε increases. (This merger through a DZE has obviously occurred in Fig. 4(d), where ϕ
is varied rather than ε.) The surviving upper Hopf bifurcation moves to higher Q as ε
increases further.

In this high-capacitance r´egime the dynamics becomes quasi one-dimensional on the
stretched timescale. To see this formally, deﬁne σ = 1/ε and multiply the stretched-
time equations 6b and 6c through by σ. In the limit σ
0 the kinetic energy variables
are slaved to the pressure gradient (or potential energy) dynamics. Switching back to

The anomaly in this low-capacitance picture is that, as the power input Q ebbs, the shear
ﬂow can grow quite unrealistically. With diminishing ε the Hopf bifurcation moves up-
ward along the curve, the branch of limit cycles shrinks, and the conjugate pair of pure
imaginary eigenvalues approaches zero. It would seem, therefore, that some important
physics is still missing from the model.

4.1 A trapped singularity is found and released

What is not shown in Figs 3 and 4 (because a log scale is used for illustrative purposes) is a
highly degenerate branch of equilibria that exists at Q = 0 where N = 0 and v′ = (P 3/2ϕ)/b;
it is shown in Fig. 7(a). For ϕ > 0 there is a trapped degenerate turning point, annotated as s4,
where the “new” branch crosses the Q = 0 branch.

The key to its release (or unfolding) lies in recognizing that kinetic energy in large-scale
structures inevitably feeds the growth of turbulence at smaller scales, as well as vice versa
(Terry, 2000). In a ﬂow where Lagrangian ﬂuid elements locally experience a velocity ﬁeld that
is predominantly two-dimensional there will be a strong tendency to upscale energy transfer
(or inverse energy cascade, see Kraichnan and Montgomery (1980)), but the net rate of energy
transfer to high wavenumber (or Kolmogorov cascade, see Ball (2004)) is not negligible. What
amounts to an ultraviolet catastrophe in the physics when energy transfer to high wavenumber is

The model now consists of Eqs 7 and 2a, with 2d, and the corresponding energy transfer
schematic is Fig. 1(c). The back- transfer rate coefﬁcient κ need not be identiﬁed with any
particular animal in the zoo of plasma and ﬂuid instabilities, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability; it is simply a lumped dimensionless parameter that expresses the inevitability of
energy transfer to high wavenumber.

The manner and consequences of release of the turning point s4 can be appreciated from
Fig. 7(b), from which we learn a salutary lesson: unphysical equilibria and singularities should
not be ignored. The unfolding of s4 creates a maximum in the shear ﬂow, and (apparently)
a fourth Hopf bifurcation is released from a trap at inﬁnity. At the given values of the other
parameters this unfolding of s4 has the effect of forming a ﬁnite-area isola of steady-state solu-
tions, but it is important to visualize this (or, indeed, any other) bifurcation diagram as a slice
of a three-dimensional surface of steady states, where the third coordinate is another parameter.
(Isolas of steady-state solutions were ﬁrst reported in the chemical engineering literature, where
nonlinear dynamical models typically include a thermal or chemical autocatalytic reaction rate
(Ball, 1999).)

In Fig. 8 we see two slices of this surface, prepared in order to demonstrate that the metamor-
phosis identiﬁed in section 3.3 is preserved through the unfolding of s4. Here the other turning
points are labelled s1, s2, and s3. Walking through Fig. 8 we make the forward transition at
s1 and progress along this branch through the onset of an a limit cycle r´egime, as in Fig. 3.
For obvious reasons we now designate this segment as the intermediate shear ﬂow branch, and
the isola or peninsula as the high shear ﬂow branch. In (a) a back-transition occurs at s2. The

system can only reach a stable attractor on the isola by a transient, either a non-quasistatic jump
in a second parameter or an evolution from initial conditions within the appropriate basin of
attraction. In (b) as we make our quasistatic way along the intermediate branch with diminish-
ing Q the shear ﬂow begins to grow, then passes through a second oscillatory domain before
reaching a maximum and dropping steeply; the back transition in this case occurs at s4.

5. Thermal dissipation affects the bifurcation structure

In the model so far the only outlet channel for the potential energy is conversion to turbulent
kinetic energy, given by the conservative transfer rate γP N. However, in a driven dissipative
system such as a plasma other conduits for gradient potential energy may be signiﬁcant.

The cross-ﬁeld thermal diffusivity, a neoclassical transport quantity (Braginskii, 1965) is
often assumed to be negligible in the strongly-driven turbulent milieu of a tokamak plasma
(Sugama and Horton, 1994; Sugama and Horton, 1995; Ball et al., 2002), but here Eq. 2 is
modiﬁed to include explicitly a linear “inﬁnite sink” thermal energy dissipation rate:

χP.

(8)

Following Thyagaraja et al. (1999) χ is taken as as a lumped dimensionless parameter and
the rate term χP as representing all non-turbulent or residual losses such as neoclassical and
radiative losses. The model now consists of Eqs 7 and 8, with 2d and the corresponding energy
schematic is Fig. 1(d).

This simple dissipative term has profound effects on the bifurcation structure of the model,
and again the best way to appreciate them is through a guided walking tour of the bifurcation
diagrams. In Fig. 9 the series of bifurcation diagrams has been computed for increasing values
of χ and a connected slice of the steady state surface (i.e., using a set of values of the other
parameters for which the metamorphosis has already occurred).

ϕ = 0.088, β = 0.3, b = 1, a = 0.3, α = 2.4, γ = 1, ε = 1. In (a) to (d) the Hopf bifurcations
are starred, and for clarity the limit cycle amplitude envelopes are omitted.

A qualitative change is immediately apparent, which has far-reaching consequences: for
χ > 0 the two new turning points s5 and s6 appear, born from a local cusp singularity that was
trapped at χ = 0. Overall, from (a) to (e) we see that s1 does not shift signiﬁcantly but that the
peninsula becomes more tilted and shifts to higher Q, but let us begin the walk at s1 in (b). Here,
as in Fig. 8, the transition occurs to an intermediate shear ﬂow state and further increments of
Q take the system through an oscillatory r´egime. But the effect of decreasing Q is radically
different: at s6 a discontinuous transition occurs to a high shear ﬂow state on the stable segment
of the peninsula. From this point we may step forward through the shear ﬂow maximum and
fall back to the intermediate branch at s5. We see that over the range of Q between s5 and s6
the system has ﬁve steady states, comprising three stable interleaved with two unstable steady
states. As in Fig. 8(b) a back transition at low Q occurs at s4.

The tristable r´egime in (b) has disappeared in (c) in a surprisingly mundane way: not through

Complex 2004

a singularity but merely by a shift of the peninsula toward higher Q. But this shift induces a
different tristable r´egime through the creation of s7 and s8 at another local cusp singularity. In
(d) s4 and s7 have been annihilated at yet another local cusp singularity. It is interesting and
quite amusing to puzzle over the 2-parameter projection of these turning points s1, s8, s7, and
s4 followed over χ, it is given in Fig. 10. The origins of the three local cusps can be read off
the diagram, keeping in mind that the crossovers are a trompe de l’oeil: they are nonlocal.

sponding to Fig. 9(e). The pressure gradient jumps at s1 because the power input exceeds the
distribution rates, and oscillatory dynamics between the energy subsystems sets in abruptly at
s5. The turbulence is enormously suppressed due to uptake of energy by the shear ﬂow, but
rises again dramatically with this hard onset of oscillations.

6. A uniﬁed model includes a nonlinear shear ﬂow drive

The early theoretical work on conﬁnement transitions attempted to explain edge L–H transitions
exclusively in terms of the electric ﬁeld driving torque created by nonambipolar ion orbit losses

Complex 2004

The 7th Asia-Paciﬁc Conference on Complex Systems

(Itoh and Itoh, 1988; Shaing and Crume, 1989; Stringer, 1993), with no coupling to the internal
dynamics of energy transfers from the potential energy reservoir in the pressure gradient. The
electric ﬁeld is bistable, hence the transition to a high shear ﬂow, or high conﬁnement, r´egime
is discontinuous and hysteretic. Although there are many supporting experiments (Fujisawa,
2003), this exposition of the physics behind conﬁnement transitions is incomplete because it
cannot explain shear ﬂow suppression of turbulence — a well-known characteristic of L–H
transitions.

−

Here this “electric ﬁeld bifurcation” physics is treated as a piece of a more holistic physical
picture and a simple model for the rate of shear ﬂow generation due to this physics is used
to create a uniﬁed dynamical model for conﬁnement transitions. Following the earlier authors
2
(w2/P )
, which simply says that the rate at which ions
this rate is given as r(P ) = ν exp
are preferentially lost, and hence ﬂow is generated, is proportional to a collision frequency ν
i
times the fraction of those collisions that result in ions with sufﬁcient energy to escape. The
form of the energy factor assumes an ion distribution that is approximately Maxwellian and w2,
analogous to an activation energy, is proportional to the square of the critical escape velocity.
In this form of the rate expression I have explicitly included the temperature-dependence of r,
through P , which couples it to the rest of the system. If w is high the rate is highly temperature
(pressure gradient) sensitive. (For heuristic purposes constant density is assumed, constants and
numerical factors are normalized to 1, and the relatively weak temperature dependence of the
collision rate ν is ignored.)

The corresponding energy schematic is Fig. 1(e) where it is seen that r(P ) is a competing
potential energy conversion channel, that can dominate the dynamics when the critical escape
velocity w is low or the pressure is high. This is exactly what we see in the bifurcation diagrams,
Fig. 12. Overall, the effect of this contribution to shear ﬂow generation from the ion orbit
loss torque is to elongate and ﬂatten the high shear ﬂow peninsula. The Hopf bifurcations
that are starred in (a), where the contribution is relatively small, have disappeared in (b) at
a DZE singularity. What this means is that as r(P ) begins to take over there is no longer
a practicably accessible intermediate branch, as can be seen in (c) where the intermediate
branch is unstable until the remaining Hopf bifurcation is encountered at extremely high Q.
Locally, in the transition region, as r(P ) becomes signiﬁcant the bifurcation diagram begins
to look more like the simple S-shaped, cubic normal form schematics with classical hysteresis
presented by earlier authors. However, this uniﬁed model accounts for shear ﬂow suppression
of the turbulence (d), whereas theirs could not.

7. Summary and conclusions

The generation of stable shear ﬂows in plasmas, and the associated conﬁnement transitions and
oscillatory behaviour in tokamaks and stellarators, is regulated by Reynolds stress decorrelation
of gradient-driven turbulence and/or by an induced bistable radial electric ﬁeld. These two
mechanisms are smoothly uniﬁed by the ﬁrst smooth road through the singularity and
bifurcation structure of a reduced dynamical model for this system.

The model is constructed self-consistently, beginning from simple rate-laws derived from
the basic pathways for energy transfer from pressure gradient to shear ﬂows. It is iteratively
strengthened by ﬁnding the singularities and allowing them to “speak for themselves”, then
matching up appropriate physics to the unfoldings of the singularities.

The smooth road from turbulence driven to electric ﬁeld driven shear ﬂows crosses interest-

ing territory:

•

•

Hysteresis is possible in both r´egimes and is governed by different physics.

A metamorphosis of the dynamics is encountered, near which hysteretic transitions are

Complex 2004

forbidden. The metamorphosis is a robust organizing centre of codimension 1, even
though there are singularities of higher codimension in the system.

Oscillatory and tristable domains are encountered.

•

•

To travel the smooth road several obstacles are successively negotiated in physically
meaningful ways: a pitchfork is dissolved, simultaneously releasing a branch of solu-
tions from a singular trap at inﬁnity, a singularity is released from a trap at zero power
input, and another is released from a trap at zero thermal diffusivity.

In particular, these results suggest strategies for controlling access to high conﬁnement states
and manipulating oscillatory behaviour in fusion experiments. More generally I have shown that
low-dimensional models have a useful role to play in the study of one of the most formidable of
complex systems, a strongly driven turbulent plasma. Having survived such a trial-by-ordeal,
the methodology is expected to continue to develop as a valuable tool for taming this and other
complex systems.

DIFFERENTIAL FORM OF THE COLLISION INTEGRAL
FOR A RELATIVISTIC PLASMA

The diﬀerential formulation of the Landau-Fokker-Planck collision integral is developed for
the case of relativistic electromagnetic interactions.
PACS numbers 52.25.Dg, 52.20.−j, 52.60.+h

Kinetic theory is founded upon the Boltzmann equation, which is a conservation equa-
tion for the phase-space distribution function of each species in an ensemble of interacting
particles. For the case of Coulomb interactions, Landau1 expressed the collision term in the
Fokker-Planck form. This mixed integro-diﬀerential representation was extended to rela-
tivistic electromagnetic interactions by Beliaev and Budker.2 For the nonrelativistic case,
it was shown by Rosenbluth et al.3 and by Trubnikov4 that the integrals appearing in the
collision term can be expressed in terms of the solution of a pair of diﬀerential equations.
The present work extends that formulation to the relativistic collision integral. Using an
expansion in spherical harmonics the relativistic diﬀerential formulation is then applied to
calculate the scattering and slowing down of fast particles in a relativistic equilibrium back-
ground plasma. Our work is relevant to the study of high temperature plasma in fusion
energy research and in astrophysics.

In the work of Landau1 and that of Beliaev and Budker,2,5 the collision term that
occurs on the right-hand side of the Boltzmann equation for species a and describes the
eﬀect of collisions with species b is written in the Fokker-Planck form,

Here, fa and fb are the distribution functions for the two species, u is the ratio of momentum
to species mass, qa and qb are the species charge, ma and mb are the species mass, ǫ0 is
the vacuum dielectric permittivity, and log Λab is the Coulomb logarithm. The kernel UUUU
is speciﬁed below. This form of the collision operator is only approximate because of the
introduction of cutoﬀs in the collision integral. More accurate operators that take into
account Debye shielding at large impact parameters and large-angle scattering and quantum
eﬀects at small impact parameters have been derived.6,7 The purpose of this letter is to
present a diﬀerential formulation for the integral transforms that occur in Eqs. (2). To avoid
unnecessary clutter we discard the factor that depends only on the species properties, drop
the species subscript, and consider the transforms

For guidance,

let us recall brieﬂy the nonrelativistic theory.3,4
In that case the
momentum-to-mass ratios u and u′ reduce to the velocities v and v′, and the collision
kernel is the one given by Landau,1 UUUU = (|s|2IIII − ss)/|s|3, where s = v − v′. It may be seen
that UUUU = ∂2|s|/∂v∂v and (∂/∂v′)·UUUU = −2∂|s|−1/∂v. To obtain the diﬀerential formulation,
these representations are inserted into Eqs. (3), and the diﬀerentiation with respect to v is
moved outside the integration over v′. Deﬁning the potentials h(v) = −(1/8π)
|s|f d3v′
|s|−1f d3v′, we have DDDD = −∂2h/∂v∂v and F = −∂g/∂v. Further-
and g(v) = −(1/4π)
more, from ∆|s| = 2|s|−1 and ∆|s|−1 = −4πδ(s) it follows that h and g obey the equations
∆h = g and ∆g = f . (∆ denotes the Laplacian with respect to the variable v.) These
equations provide the diﬀerential formulation of the collision term in the nonrelativistic
case.

The Landau collision kernel was obtained in a semi-relativistic fashion, assuming
Coulomb collisions and relativistic particle kinematics. It is a good approximation to the
fully relativistic kernel given below provided that |v.v′| ≪ c2, which is true when one of the
colliding particles is nonrelativistic. However, the reduction of the collision integral to the
diﬀerential form of Rosenbluth and Trubnikov relies on the stronger assumptions |v|2 ≪ c2
and |v′|2 ≪ c2, and is therefore entirely nonrelativistic. A diﬀerential formulation that is
exactly equivalent to the Landau collision integral was given by Franz.8

We turn now to the diﬀerential formulation of the relativistic collision integral due to

Beliaev and Budker.2,5,6 They obtained the expression

1 + |u|2, γ′ =

∂

∂u′ · UUUU(u, u′

) =

2r2/(γγ′)
(r2 − 1)3/2 (ru − u′

).

Notice that r is the relativistic correction factor for the relative velocity between the two
particles (i.e., for the velocity of one particle in the rest frame of the other). Conversely,
this relative velocity is given by r−1(r2 − 1)1/2.

In developing a diﬀerential formulation for the collision term based on the Beliaev and
Budker kernel, it is helpful to work in terms of relativistically covariant quantities. The
expression γγ′UUUU is equal to the space part of a four-tensor W that depends on the four-
vectors u = (γ, u) and u′ = (γ′, u′),

W ij(u, u

) =

(cid:1)

where gij is the metric tensor, with signature −+++. (r = −uiu′i is clearly a four-scalar.)
The tensor W is symmetric (W ij = W ji), symmetric in u and u′, satisﬁes uiW ij = 0, and
i = 2r2(r2 − 1)−1/2. Likewise γγ′(∂/∂u′) · UUUU is the space part of the four-vector
satisﬁes W i
V , where

V i(u, u

) =

2r2

(r2 − 1)3/2 (rui − u

′i).

(5b)

If the relativistic diﬀerential formulation is to parallel most closely the nonrelativistic
formulation, then one should ﬁnd a representation of the form W ij = Hijψ and V i = −2Giϕ,
where ψ and ϕ are four-scalars depending on u and u′, and Hij and Gi are covariant
diﬀerential operators acting on the variable u. In the nonrelativistic limit, ψ should reduce
to |v − v′| and ϕ should reduce to |v − v′|−1. It should be possible to transform ψ and
ϕ to delta functions by a sequence of second-order diﬀerential operators. The potentials

(ψf /γ′) d3u′ and g = −(1/4π)

(ϕf /γ′) d3u′; these
would be deﬁned as h = −(1/8π)
expressions deﬁne four-scalars (cf. Ref. 5). The diﬀerential equations satisﬁed by h and g
follow immediately from those satisﬁed by ψ and ϕ. Finally, DDDD would be obtained as the
space part of −γ−1Hijh and F as the space part of −γ−1Gig. In fact, it will turn out that
the relativistic formulation has to be somewhat more complicated, but not fundamentally
diﬀerent from the outline just sketched.

A function of the four-vectors u and u′ that is a four-scalar must be a function of
r = −u.u′ alone. The form of the diﬀerential operators Hij and Gi is restricted because
these should be interior operators on the surface u2 = −1 in four-space. In addition, it is
required that Hij = Hji and uiHij = 0. Under those restrictions it is found that the most
general form of Hij and Gi, up to a multiplicative constant, is Hij χ = Lij χ + α(gij + uiuj)χ
and Giχ = Kiχ + βuiχ. Here, α and β are arbitrary constants, and

Lijχ = (gik + uiuk)(gjl + ujul)

These representations for W and V are only suitable for constructing a diﬀerential
formulation of the collision term if the functions that occur on the right-hand sides can be
reduced to delta functions by some sequence of diﬀerential operators. For that purpose the
contraction L = Li
i is needed; in terms of the three-space variables it is

Lχ = (IIII + uu) :

If χ is a function of r alone, then Lχ = (r2 − 1)(d2χ/dr2) + 3r(dχ/dr) away from r = 1; at
r = 1 (or u = u′) there may be a singularity. Speciﬁcally, it is found that

These potentials satisfy the diﬀerential equations

[L − 3]h1 = h0,
[L − 3]h2 = h1,

Lg1 = g0.

Finally one obtains DDDD and F as

DDDD(u) = −γ
F(u) = −γ

Equations (11–12) together with the deﬁnitions, Eqs. (7) and (9), provide the diﬀerential
formulation in the relativistic case.

In order to proceed further analytically, it is useful to decompose the distribution

function and the potentials in spherical harmonics, e.g.,

f (u, θ, φ) =

fnm(u)P m

n (cos θ) exp(imφ).

Here u = |u| (diﬀerent from the convention used earlier), θ is the polar angle, and φ is
the azimuthal angle. The equation [L − α]g = f is equivalent to the system of separated
equations [Ln − α]gnm = fnm, where

The solution to the homogeneous equation [Dn − a2]z = 0 is required in order to construct a
Green’s function for the problem. To obtain this solution we note the following recurrence:
If zn−1,a solves [Dn−1 − a2]z = 0, then zn,a = (sinh x)−1(d/dx)zn−1,a solves [Dn − a2]z =
0. Furthermore, for n = −1 the homogeneous equation is trivial to solve. However, the
recurrence breaks down in the case that a is an integer. If a = n, then zn−1,a = 1 solves

The integral that occurs here can be expressed in closed form.

The Green’s function allows us to reduce the separated ordinary diﬀerential equations
to quadrature. An important special application for these results is in the treatment of
collisions oﬀ an equilibrium background distribution. Assuming that fb is a stationary
Maxwellian with density nb and temperature Tb and that the energy of the colliding particles

To conclude, we have presented a diﬀerential formulation for the Beliaev and Budker2
relativistic collision integral. This permits the rapid numerical evaluation of the collision
term. A decomposition into spherical harmonics is useful in carrying out analytical work. It
also provides a convenient method for calculating the boundary conditions for the potentials.

It is demonstrated that low frequency shear modes in a strongly coupled, inhomogeneous, dusty
plasma can grow on account of an instability involving the dynamical charge ﬂuctuations of the
dust grains. The instability is driven by the gradient of the equilibrium dust charge density and is
associated with the ﬁnite charging time of the dust grains. The present calculations, carried out in
the generalized hydrodynamic viscoelastic formalism, also bring out important modiﬁcations in the
threshold and growth rate of the instability due to collective eﬀects associated with coupling to the
compressional mode.

I. INTRODUCTION

Dusty plasmas are of great interest because of their possible applications to a number of ﬁelds of contemporary
research such as plasma astrophysics of interplanetary and interstellar matter, fusion research, plasmas used for
semiconductor etching, arc plasmas used to manufacture ﬁne metal and ceramic powders, plasmas in simple ﬂames
etc. [1]. It is now widely recognized that the dust component in these plasmas is often in the strongly coupled coulomb
regime with the parameter, Γ ≃ (Zde)2/Tdd, typically taking values much greater than unity ((−Zde) is the charge
on the dust particle, d ≃ n
is the interparticle distance and Td is the temperature of the dust component). This
leads to many novel physical eﬀects such as the formation of dust plasma crystals [2], modiﬁed dispersion of the
compressional waves [3,4], the existence of the transverse shear waves [4] etc. Many of these novel features have now
been veriﬁed by experiments and computer simulations [5].

Recently, an experiment on the self–excitation of the vertical motion of the dust particles trapped in a plasma
sheath boundary, has been reported [6]. The physics of this excitation is related to charging of the dust particles by
the inﬂow of ambient plasma currents in the inhomogeneous plasma sheath and the delay resulting because of the
ﬁnite time required by the charging process to bring the dust charge to its ambient steady state value. In this paper,
we demonstrate that the same physical mechanism can be used for the excitation of the transverse shear modes in
an inhomogeneous strongly coupled dusty plasma. Using a generalized hydrodynamic viscoelastic formalism [7] to
describe the strongly coupled dusty plasma and incorporating the novel feature of time variation of the dust charge
through a charge dynamics equation [8], we have derived a general dispersion relation for low frequency shear and
compressional modes in the plasma. We ﬁnd that in a plasma with ﬁnite gradients of the equilibrium dust charge
density, the two modes are coupled and we show that the shear mode is driven unstable if certain threshold values
are exceeded.

Our paper is organized as follows. In the next section we brieﬂy discuss the equilibrium of an inhomogeneous dusty
plasma that is conﬁned against gravity by the electric ﬁeld of a plasma sheath. In such a conﬁguration dust particles
of varying sizes and charges arrange themselves in horizontal layers at diﬀerent heights to form a nonuniform cloud
[9,10]. In section 3 we carry out a linear stability analysis of such an equilibrium in the framework of the generalized
hydrodynamic equations. The dispersion relation of the coupled shear wave and compression wave is solved analyt-
ically (in simple limits) as well as numerically in section 4. The physical mechanism of the shear wave instability is
also discussed and the modiﬁcations in the threshold and growth rate brought about by the coupling to compressive
waves are elucidated. Section 5 is devoted to a summary and discussion of the principal results.

We consider an inhomogeneous sheath equilibrium in which the dust particles are suspended with electric ﬁeld
forces balancing the gravitational force on the particle and in which the dust charge (−Zde) and dust size rd are both
functions of the vertical distance z. Then the force balance equation gives,

where, ρ , g , E0
refer respectively to the dust mass density, gravitational acceleration and the sheath electric
ﬁeld. For particle sizes of the order of a few microns, other forces acting on the particle (such as the drag and viscous
forces) are about an order of magnitude smaller than the electric and gravitational forces and can be neglected for
the equilibrium calculation [10]. Note that for dust particles of a uniform size (monodispersive size distribution) the
above equilibrium can only be attained at one vertical point leading to a monolayer of dust. A dispersion in sizes leads
to a large number of layers resulting in a nonuniform dust cloud with a gradient in the equilibrium charge (−Zde)
and the dust size rd. The electric ﬁeld E0 is determined by the sheath condition,

where ne,i,d
are the local electron, ion and dust densities respectively. The charge (−Zde) on a dust particle in
the sheath region is given by (−Zde) = Cd(φf − φ) where Cd is the capacitance, φf is the ﬂoating potential at the
surface of the dust particle and φ is the bulk plasma potential. For a spherical dust particle Cd = rd, and the ﬂoating
potential can be determined by the steady state condition from the dust charging equation, namely, [8]

where the electron and ion currents impinging on the dust particle are given by [1]

Here Te and Ti are the electron and ion temperatures, mi is the ion mass and vid is the mean drifting velocity of the
ions in the electric ﬁeld of the sheath (it is assumed to be the ion sound velocity at the sheath edge). We also assume
that the dust particles have much smaller thermal velocities than the electrons and ions.

Equations (1 - 3) selfconsistently determine the equilibrium of the dust cloud. Such clouds have been experimentally
observed in a number of experiments [9,10]. In [10] theoretical modeling along the lines discussed above, agree very
well with the experimental observations of clouds formed with polydispersive particle size distribution of dust particles
trapped in the plasma sheath region. A typical equilibrium variation of the dust particle size with the vertical distance,
when the Child Langmuir law holds for the plasma sheath potential, is given as [10],

where
µi = (eλi−n/mi)1/2 with λi−n representing the mean free path of ions colliding with the background neutrals. Using
(5) we can obtain the corresponding z variation for Zd.

As discussed in detail in [10], this dust cloud equilibrium is conﬁned to the plasma sheath boundary region in the
potential well created from the upward electrostatic and downward gravitational forces. Note that the force balance
equation (1) does not prevent the particles from oscillating about their mean positions especially if they have signiﬁ-
cant kinetic energy or temperature. However their mean positions are at various vertical distances and the mean Zd
is a function of z. This is reminiscent of particle gyrations in a magnetic ﬁeld. If we consider wave motions in which
dust oscillation excursions are much smaller than wavelengths, we can use a ﬂuid theory to analyze such behaviour.
In the next section, we adopt this view point and carry out a linear stability analysis of the equilibrium discussed
above to low frequency wave perturbations.

III. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS

For low frequency perturbations in the regime kvthd << ω << kvthe, kvthi, where vthd, vthe and vthi are the
thermal velocities of the dust, electron and ion components respectively, the electron and ion responses obey the
Boltzmann law which can be simply obtained from an ordinary hydrodynamic representation. The dust component
on the other hand can be in the strongly coupled regime for which a proper description is provided by the generalized
viscoelastic formalism. Using such a description a general dispersion relation for low frequency waves (with typical
wavelengths longer than any lattice spacings) was obtained in [4] for longitudinal sound waves and transverse shear
waves. The shear modes exist in a strongly coupled dusty plasma because of elasticity eﬀects introduced by strong
correlations [4]. Our objective in this work is to look for the eﬀect of dust charge dynamics on these shear modes in
the strongly coupled regime. As demonstrated in our earlier work [4], the coupling of the low frequency shear modes
to transverse electromagnetic perturbations is ﬁnite but negligibly small; we ignore this coupling here. However,
introduction of the dust charge dynamics in the inhomogeneous plasma leads to a coupling of the low frequency shear
and compressional modes; thus the space charge dynamics and quasineutrality condition play an important role in
describing the perturbations. The basic equations for the dust ﬂuid [7] we work with, are the continuity equation,

In the above, M is the dust mass, ν is the dust–neutral collision frequency, δud, δnd and δZd are the perturbations
in the dust velocity, number density and dust charge, δP , δE are the pressure and electric ﬁeld perturbations, nd0
and Zd are the equilibrium number density and charge for the dust and E0 is the unperturbed electric ﬁeld. η and ζ
refer to the coeﬃcients of the shear and bulk viscosities and τm is the viscoelastic relaxation time. Note that in the
continuity equation we have a contribution from the equilibrium inhomogeneity in the dust mass distribution (arising
from the size dispersion of the particles). This term as we shall see later modiﬁes the real frequency of the shear
waves.

These equations are supplemented with the dynamical equation for the dust charge perturbations which, for per-

turbations with phase velocity much smaller than the electron and ion thermal velocities, is given as [8]

where, ηc =
that the second term on the left hand side of eq.(10) arises because of the inhomogeneity of the mean charge on
the dust particles; as shall be shown later, this is the critical term responsible for the instability. It is also obvious
that the dust charge variation in space will lead to shielding by electrons and ions with the associated coupling
of the perturbation to dust compressional modes. We must thus extend the above set of equations to include the
quasi-neutrality condition,

These are the Boltzmann relations which arise whenever the perturbations satisfy ω << kvthe, kvthi.

We shall next derive the dispersion relation for the low frequency mode. We may note that the typical time scale
for the decay of the charge ﬂuctuations for the dust can be very small [6], with ηc >> ω and we shall work in that
limit. We use the local approximation (wave lengths smaller than characteristic equilibrium scale lengths) and choose
the propagation vector for the wave perturbation as ~k = (k, 0, 0), the perturbed dust velocity, ~δud = (δu1, 0, δu3) and
the perturbation in the electric ﬁeld as ~δE = −ikδφ(1, 0, 0). Using the continuity equation (6) and the equations (10)
– (12), and after some simple algebra, one obtains the ﬂuctuation in the dust charge and the potential as

and the coupling to the compressive mode.

In the absence of the inhomogeneities and the collision term, this is the basic shear wave described in [4]. The
collisional term introduces wave damping. The inhomogeneous terms introduce two important modiﬁcations. The
term proportional to the mass (size) inhomogeneity contributes to the real part of the frequency whereas the charge
inhomogeneity term can drive the wave unstable if E0a2 < 0 (i.e., E0Q′
MD a2|
is satisﬁed. Physically, this instability arises because of delayed charging eﬀect, the same physical mechanism which
was used by Nunomura et al [6] to explain the observed instability of single particle vertical displacement in their
sheath experiments. Speciﬁcally, the charge on the vertically oscillating dust particle in the shear wave propagating
in the inhomogeneous plasma, is always diﬀerent from the equilibrium value Zd because of the ﬁnite charging time
. This perturbation is of order δZd ≃ Z ′

the ambient electric ﬁeld at a rate δZdE0δu∗
3 ≈ |E0Z ′
d||δu3|2/ηc. When this energy gain by the shear wave exceeds
2 |δu3|2, we have an instability. This gives us the approximate threshold condition
the loss rate due to collisions ≈ νM
described above. If we express the dust neutral collision frequency, ν in terms of the ambient neutral pressure as
M , our threshold condition is functionally identical to that derived by Nunomura et al [6] on the basis
ν = p
of physical arguments. The only substantial diﬀerence is their use of exponential charging time which follows from
our equation (10) viz. δZd ≈ (δu3Z ′
d/ηc)[1 − exp(−ηct)]; since we have assumed the frequency of the shear mode
ω << ηc, we use the asymptotic condition described above.

We now demonstrate that for the collective shear mode being described here, the coupling to the compressional
dust acoustic wave due to the last two terms in equation (16) is very crucial; thus the above single particle results are
strongly modiﬁed by the hydrodynamic treatment. A simple analytic result clearly demonstrating the modiﬁcation is
obtained by neglecting ω2 + iων compared to k2C2
DA in the second bracket of equation (16); this is reasonable when
the wave–vector k is not too small. In this limit, the shear modes are described by the root

We thus note that the threshold condition and the growth rates are signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the inclusion of coupling
to compressional waves. In order to quantitatively illustrate the eﬀect of coupling terms, we now present a detailed

coeﬃcient ζ is negligible compared to the shear viscosity coeﬃcient, η, particularly in the one component plasma
(OCP) limit [7] and so we shall drop it in our calculations. Further, the viscoelastic relaxation time, τm, is given as

Equation (21) has been solved numerically for the shear mode roots and some typical results are presented in ﬁgures
(1) and (2). Figures (1a) and (1b) display a comparison of the dispersion curve for the shear mode (ˆωR vs ˆk and ˆγ vs ˆk
for ﬁxed values of e0 = −0.0008 and e1 = −0.05), with and without the inclusion of the coupling to the compressional
mode. The various ﬁxed parameter values corresponding to these curves are ˆC2
DA = 0.4, ˆν = 0.0004 and
e01 = 0.3, e11 = −0.01 when the coupling is on. The choice of these numerical values for the dimensionless parameters
ˆν, ˆk, e0, e01, ˆCsh and ˆCDA has been guided by the magnitude of these quantities observed in some of the laboratory
plasmas [9,10]. It is seen from these plots that there is a substantial inﬂuence of the compressional mode coupling,
described through the parameter, e01, e11, on the growth rate and the real frequency of the shear wave emphasizing
the importance of the collective physics of coupling to the compressional mode. We next plot in ﬁgure (2) the gas
pressure, p, versus ne0 proﬁles for various values of γ, the imaginary part of ω. Plotting the γ = 0 curve, we get a
threshold relation between p and ne0, where we ﬁx the other parameters as follows – dust radius, rd=2.5 microns, the
inter–grain distance, d=430 microns, Te = Ti ≃ 1eV , kd = 1, and dust mass density, ρd=2.5 gms/cm3. We see that
the qualitative trend of the curve is similar to that observed in the single particle instability studies of [6] illustrating
the commonality of the underlying physical mechanism. However it should be emphasized that the experiment in
[6] did not observe any collective excitations and their equilibrium consisted of a monolayer of equal sized particles.
The equilibria of [9,10] are more appropriate for observing collective excitations of shear waves and our theoretical
results can be usefully employed in such a situation. In Fig.(2) we have once again highlighted the signiﬁcance of
the coupling to the compressive wave, in this case for its eﬀect on the threshold values, by displaying the uncoupled
threshold and growth rate curves (dashed curves). Note that the inﬂuence of the coupling is to raise the threshold
value at low values of ne0 (i.e. a higher value of p is needed to excite the instability) whereas it reduces the threshold
at the higher end of the ne0 scale. The rest of the curves displayed in the ﬁgure (2) correspond to the various positive
values of γ, which correspond to the situation where the shear mode is excited and saturates at some values. These
ﬁgures are again qualitatively similar to the curves obtained in [6] for various saturation amplitudes. However a direct
comparison is again not appropriate for the reason discussed above and also because our calculations are linear and
cannot provide any quantitative results about nonlinearly saturated amplitudes.

V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

To summarize, in this paper we have investigated the stability of a low frequency shear mode in an inhomogeneous
dusty plasma in the strongly correlated regime. The equilibrium dust cloud has both an inhomogeneity in the dust
charge distribution and in the dust mass distribution (arising from a distribution in the sizes of the dust particles).
The shear mode in such a plasma undergoes two signiﬁcant modiﬁcations. Its real frequency is shifted by a contri-
bution from the mass inhomogeneity and the dust charge inhomogeneity can drive it unstable through the dynamics
of dust charge ﬂuctuations in a manner very similar to the instability of the vertical motion of single particles in
a plasma sheath as observed in the recent experiment of Nunomura et al [6]. The ﬁnite charging time, η−1
of the
dust particles plays a critical role in the instability. We also show how collective eﬀects due to coupling with the
compressional modes strongly modify the threshold conditions for the instability as well as its growth rate and real
frequency. Our calculations have been carried out in the hydrodynamic formalism including viscoelastic eﬀects and we
have neglected any kinetic eﬀects. Our results are therefore strictly valid in the low frequency limit. Finite corrections
arising from kinetic eﬀects can occur at higher frequencies and wave numbers. This has recently been demonstrated
for the compressive dust acoustic mode in a dusty plasma from a kinetic calculation based on the dynamic local ﬁeld
correction (DLFC) method [12]. Such corrections, if any, for the transverse shear mode has not yet been done and
needs to be examined.

c

Finally we would like to remark that the transverse dust shear mode which is a collective mode of the strongly
coupled plasma regime has only been observed in computer simulations till now; its detailed experimental investigation
is therefore of great current interest. Such waves can be excited in inhomogeneous dust clouds that have been obtained
in the experiments carried out with varying grain sizes [9,10]. It would be of interest therefore to look for the wave
features discussed in our model calculations in controlled propagation experiments on such equilibria.
It is also
apparent that free energy sources, such as ion beams, which may readily couple with the compressional waves may also

6

be useful for exciting the more interesting shear waves in the strongly coupled inhomogeneous plasma. Investigation
of these and related eﬀects are in progress.

FIG. 2. The electron number density ne0 (in units of 108/cm3) is plotted as a function of the gas pressure, p (in mtorr)
for various values of γ. For comparison, the accompanying dashed curves display the situation when the coupling to the
compressional mode is neglected.

The electric microﬁeld distribution at charged particles is studied for two-component

electron-ion plasmas using molecular dynamics simulation and theoretical models. The parti-

cles are treated within classical statistical mechanics using an electron-ion Coulomb potential

regularized at distances less than the de Broglie length to take into account the quantum-

diﬀraction eﬀects. The potential-of-mean-force (PMF) approximation is deduced from a

canonical ensemble formulation. The resulting probability density of the electric microﬁeld

satisﬁes exactly the second-moment sum rule without the use of adjustable parameters. The

correlation functions between the charged radiator and the plasma ions and electrons are

calculated using molecular dynamics simulations and the hypernetted-chain approximation

for a two-component plasma. It is shown that the agreement between the theoretical models

for the microﬁeld distributions and the simulations is quite good in general.

INTRODUCTION

Because of the Stark eﬀect, the ﬂuctuating electric microﬁelds created by the charged particles

in a plasma inﬂuence its optical and thermodynamic properties. They aﬀect the proﬁles of spectral

lines (broadening and shift) and eﬀectively lower the photoionization thresholds of atoms and ions

immersed in a plasma [1, 2, 3]. A comparison of experimental and theoretical widths and shapes

of the Stark-broadened spectral lines is widely used for plasma diagnostics [4, 5].

Under certain assumptions [1, 2], the observed spectral line shapes can be closely related to the

electric microﬁeld distribution at the radiating atom or ion (radiator) [6, 7]. Within the quasistatic

approximation the problem is then reduced to a determination of the probability distribution of

the low-frequency component of the perturbing electric ﬁelds. This is mainly associated with the

distribution of the heavier perturbing particles, i.e. the ions, whereas the electrons can be assumed

to adjust instantaneously to the conﬁguration of the ions.

Since the pioneering work of Holtsmark [6], who completely neglected correlations between the

particles (ideal plasma), many eﬀorts have been concentrated on an improved statistical description

of the microﬁeld distribution. The ﬁrst theory which goes beyond the Holtsmark limit and which

is based on a cluster expansion similar to that of Ursell and Mayer [8] was developed by Baranger

and Mozer [9, 10]. In this approach the microﬁeld distribution is represented as an expansion in

terms of correlation functions which has been truncated on the level of the pair correlation. The

latter is treated in the Debye-H¨uckel form which corresponds to the ﬁrst order of the expansion in

the coupling parameter. The theory by Baranger and Mozer was improved by Hooper [11, 12] and

later by Tighe and Hooper [13, 14]. Based on Broyles’ collective-coordinate technique [15] they

reformulated the expansion of the microﬁeld distribution in terms of other functions by introducing

a free parameter which was adjusted in such a way to arrive at a level where the resulting microﬁeld

distribution did not depend on the free parameter any more. A further improvement of this model

was made in Ref. [16] considering a Debye-chain cluster expansion. Afterwards the Baranger-

Mozer second order theory was extended by including higher order corrections, like the triple

correlation contribution [17, 18]. However, it was argued that such a method is only valid for

low-density, high-temperature plasmas, i.e. at small coupling parameters, where the correction to

the Holtsmark distribution, corresponding to the ﬁrst term in the series, is small.

In the limit

of very strong coupling and without screening Meyer’s harmonic oscillator model is applicable

[19], in which every ion is assumed to oscillate independently of the others around its equilibrium

position at the ion-sphere center. The ﬁrst theory capable to provide reliable numerical results

for strongly coupled plasmas, known as adjustable-parameter exponential approximation (APEX),

was proposed by Iglesias, Lebowitz et al. [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. This phenomenological but highly

successful approximation is based on a special parameterization of the electric microﬁeld produced

on a radiator. It involves a non-interacting quasiparticle representation of the electron-screened

ions, designed to yield the correct second moment of the microﬁeld distribution. APEX was ﬁrst

developed for three- and two-dimensional Coulomb systems [21, 22] and later adapted to screened

Coulomb systems and ion mixtures [23, 24]. (See also Ref. [25] for the corrected version of APEX

for a neutral radiator). Another approach providing reliable numerical results for the strongly

coupled plasmas was proposed by Iglesias [26]. Following the idea of Morita [27] on the similarity

of the representation of the microﬁeld distribution to that of the excess chemical potential, Iglesias

reduced the problem to a determination of the radial distribution function (RDF) for a ﬁctitious

system with an imaginary part in the interaction energy. Employing this idea Lado and Dufty

[28, 29, 30] developed an integral equation technique for calculating the RDF and good agreement

was found with computer simulations. It is now possible to calculate the microﬁeld distribution

from Monte Carlo (MC) or molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of plasmas [31, 32, 33, 34, 35].

These methods allows to study the eﬀects of microﬁeld nonuniformity [36, 37] and the dynamical

properties of the electric microﬁeld [35, 38] as well as to simulate the high-frequency microﬁeld

distribution in electron plasmas [35, 39]. With these powerful tools one can check the accuracy of

theoretical models and establish asymptotic or analytic ﬁtting formulas suitable for applications

(see, e.g. [40, 41] and references therein).

Until now most work was done on either electronic or ionic one-component plasmas (OCP)

neglecting the inﬂuence of the attractive interactions between electrons and ions. Here we treat ions

and electrons on an equal footing by concentrating on two-component plasmas (TCP). Previously

this has been done in Ref. [42] for partially degenerate electrons. In particular, the low-frequency

component of the microﬁeld was calculated within the linear response treatment taking strong

correlations into account via local ﬁeld corrections. Also the problem of attractive interaction has

been considered for single but highly charged impurity ion immersed in an electronic OCP (see,

e.g. Ref. [43] for a recent review of these cases).

In the present paper we study strongly coupled systems, i.e. a highly charged radiator in a TCP

of classical (nondegenerated) and strongly correlated particles beyond a perturbative treatment.

As in Ref. [42] the presented theoretical scheme is based on the potential-of-mean-force (PMF)

approximation which exactly satisﬁes the sum-rule requirement arising from the second moment of

the microﬁeld distribution without introducing adjustable parameters. Another important ingre-

dient is the electron-ion attractive interaction which drastically changes the physical properties of

the system as compared to classical OCPs (see, e.g., [43]). This may cause signiﬁcant changes in

the microﬁeld distribution on either neutral or charged radiators. But the thermodynamic stability

of a TCP requires some quantum features for the electron-ion interaction at short distances. Here

we focus on an application of classical statistical mechanics and MD simulations which is enabled

by using a regularized ion-electron potential where the divergence at the origin is removed [27, 44],

see also [43, 45] for a review.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we deﬁne the systems and parameters of inter-

est as well as the theoretical model to calculate the microﬁeld distribution in a TCP. The exact

second moment for the charged radiator is calculated in Sec. III. The theoretical schemes applied

previously to either electronic or ionic OCPs are generalized to TCPs in Sec. IV. In particular,

we consider the Holtsmark distribution, express the microﬁeld distribution through the pair dis-

tribution functions, and deduce the PMF approximation from the classical canonical ensemble.

Furthermore we construct a theoretical approach based on the exponential approximation where

the eﬀective electric ﬁelds are calculated on the basis of the PMF approximation and the pair corre-

lation functions. In Sec. V we consider the hypernetted-chain (HNC) integral equations technique

to calculate these functions in a two component plasma. In order to test the theoretical models

we carried out classical MD simulations to calculate both the pair correlation functions and the

microﬁeld distribution. Technical aspects and the numerical results are presented in Sec. V. These

results are summarized in Sec. VI. Some details of the calculations are described in the Appendix.

II. MICROFIELD DISTRIBUTION IN A TCP: THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

A. Basic parameters for the TCP

We consider a neutral and isotropic two component electron-ion plasma consisting of Ni ions

and Ne electrons at a temperature T in a volume Ω. The particles are assumed to be classical

and pointlike. The average densities, charges and masses of the ions and electrons are ni = Ni/Ω,

ne = Ne/Ω, and Ze, −e and mi, m, respectively. We assume that the density of radiator ions

are small, nR ≪ ni;e and thus consider only one radiator ion with charge ZRe in our calculations

(throughout this paper the index R refers to the radiators). Because of the charge neutrality we

have NiZ − Ne + ZR = 0. In the thermodynamic limit (Ni;e → ∞ and Ω → ∞) this is equivalent

to ne = niZ.

We now introduce the Coulomb coupling parameters Γαβ which play an important role for

characterizing the properties of a TCP. Introducing the Wigner-Seitz radii, i.e. the mean electron-

electron, electron-ion and ion-ion distances through the relations, a−3

e = 4πne/3, a−3 = 4πn/3 and

a−3
i = 4πni/3 (where n = ne + ni is the plasma total density) these parameters are deﬁned as

respectively, where e2

S = e2/4πε0. Note that

.

(1)

(2)

In a hydrogen plasma with Z = 1 we obtain Γee = Γii = 2−1/3Γei while in a plasma with highly
charged ions (Z ≫ 1) Γii = Z 2/3Γei and Γee = Γei/Z. For Z > 2 the coupling parameters satisfy

the inequality Γee < Γei < Γii.

Here we consider the pair interaction potential e2

Sqαqβuαβ (r) with α; β = e, i, R, qe = −1,

qi = Z, qR = ZR, and

uαβ (r) =

1 − e−r/δαβ

r

(3)

(cid:16)
which is regularized at small distances due to quantum-diﬀraction eﬀects. In this paper we assume
1/2,

that the Coulomb potential is cutoﬀ at the thermal de Broglie wavelengths, δαβ =

~2/µαβkBT

(cid:17)

where µαβ is the reduced mass of the particles α and β. For large distances r > δαβ the potential

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

becomes Coulomb, while for r < δαβ the Coulomb singularity is removed and uαβ(0) = 1/δαβ . By

this the short range eﬀects based on the uncertainty principle are included [27, 43, 44, 45].

For a classical description of a plasma the electron degeneracy parameter Θe, i.e. the ratio of

the thermal energy and the Fermi energy must fulﬁll Θe = kBT /EF > 1. Or, alternatively, the

electron thermal wavelength should be smaller than the electron-electron mean distance, δee <
2 (4/9π)1/3 ae ≃ 1.04ae. Since an ion is much heavier than an electron this condition is usually
fulﬁlled for ions. We note that δii ≪ δei and δee ≃ 21/2δei since µei ≃ m. Therefore one can expect

that the regularization given by Eq. (3) is less important for ions than for electrons. Furthermore,

scattering of any two particles is classical for impact parameters that are large compared to the

de Broglie wavelengths. Typical impact parameters are given by the Landau lengths, λLαβ =

e2
S |qαqβ| /kBT . Its ratio to the de Broglie wavelengths is given by

This is also the maximum value of the interparticle interaction energy in the units of kBT , where
σee < σei ≪ σii and σei ≃ 21/2Zσee. Classical description of the scattering events in the TCP is

valid if σee > 1. This can be alternatively written in the explicit form kBT < 1 Ry. Combining

this condition with the one considered above we ﬁnally obtain the temperature domain where

the classical treatment is adequate, EF < kBT < 1 Ry. This condition occurs at lower densities

of electrons. Since the parameter δee increases with electron-ion Coulomb coupling the classical

condition σee > 1 implies that the state with stronger Γei behaves more classical as discussed in

Ref. [43].

B. Microﬁeld distribution formulation within thermodynamic canonical ensemble

The electric microﬁeld distribution (MFD) Q (ε) is deﬁned as the probability density of ﬁnding
a ﬁeld E = ε at a charge ZRe, located at r0, in a TCP with Ni ions and Ne electrons. This system

is described by classical statistical mechanics in a canonical ensemble of (Ni + Ne + 1) particles,
and temperature T . The normalized probability density of the microﬁeld ε in the thermodynamic

limit is then given by

Q (ε) =

e−βT U (Te,Ti,r0)δ (ε − E (Te, Ti, r0)) dr0dTedTi,

W

ZΩ

where βT = 1/kBT , and Te = {r1, r2...rNe}, Ti = {R1, R2...RNi } are the coordinates of electrons

and ions, respectively. Here

W =

e−βT U (Te,Ti,r0)dr0dTedTi

ZΩ

is the canonical partition function and U (Te, Ti, r0) is the potential energy of the conﬁguration

U (Te, Ti, r0) = Uee (Te) + Uii (Ti) + Uei (Te, Ti) + UeR (Te, r0) + UiR (Ti, r0)

(7)

with electron-electron, ion-ion, electron-ion, electron-radiator and ion-radiator interaction terms,

respectively. Assuming spherical symmetric interactions between the particles the interaction terms

in Eq. (7) can be represented as

Therefore the Fourier transform of the MFD can be interpreted as a generating function for mi-

croﬁeld even moments. Moreover, Eqs. (14) and (15) suggest a simple criterion for the existence of

even moments. In particular, the second moment of the MFD exists if the function L (K) and its

ﬁrst and second derivatives are regular at the origin. Eqs. (5)-(15) then describe the total MFD at

the position r0 of the radiator generated by both the statistically distributed ions and electrons of

the TCP. Since we are interested to calculate the MFD, Eq. (5), in an inﬁnite system the statistical

average of any quantity becomes translationally invariant with respect to r0, and the location of

the test charge may be taken as the origin without loss of generality.

III. SECOND MOMENT

A knowledge of moment sum rules is often useful in developing approximation schemes for

ﬂuids and plasmas. The moments of the MFD ﬁx the shape of the distribution and involves

some useful information about the system. For example, the exact second moment has been

previously incorporated into the calculation of the MFDs in the APEX scheme. Here, we derive

exact expressions for the second moment of the MFD on charged radiators. Note that in general

the existence of the second moment requires that the MFD decays at large electric ﬁelds faster

than ε−3.

Let us consider the exact expression for the second moment of the microﬁeld distribution in the

TCP and for a charged radiator. The second moment may be written in the form

diverges at small distances for a bare Coulomb potential. This indicates that the second moment

of the microﬁeld distribution does not exist for a classical Coulomb TCP. But in the OCP limit

IV. APPROXIMATE CALCULATIONS OF THE MFD

In this section we generalize the existing theoretical approaches developed originally for a OCP

to a two component electron-ion plasma. For practical applications we will consider the exponential

approximation considered in Ref. [46], and, as a simple but useful example the Holtsmark limit for

the MFD in a TCP.

A.

Ideal plasmas: Holtsmark distribution

We ﬁrst consider the microﬁeld distribution in an ideal TCP with Γee, Γei, Γii → 0, i.e. in the

high temperature regime T → ∞. In this case Eq. (12) yields

(cid:27)

In the thermodynamic limit (Nα, Ω → ∞, Nα/Ω = nα = const), and recalling that T (K) = e−L(K)

we obtain from Eq. (23)

L (K) =

4πnα

[1 − j0 (KEα (r))] r2dr.

Z

We study this expression for two types of interaction potentials.

(i) For a bare Coulomb interaction Eq. (24) yields L (K) = (KEH)3/2, where EH is the Holts-

mark ﬁeld for a TCP, E3/2

H = E3/2
ﬁelds, respectively, EHe = CeF /a2

Hi . Here EHe and EHi are the electronic and ionic Holtsmark
i with C = (8π/25)1/3. Since EHe = Z −1/3EHi
the electronic and ionic components of a hydrogen TCP contribute equally to the Holtsmark ﬁeld.

e, EHi = CZeF /a2

He +E3/2

For a completely ionized TCP with highly charged ions the ions dominate EH. The deﬁnition of

(23)

(24)

the Holtsmark ﬁeld EH for a TCP is equivalent to the obvious relation n = ne + ni and can be

represented as

with an eﬀective charge Z. For a hydrogen TCP with Z = 1 also Z = 1. In other cases the eﬀective

charge increases with Z and behaves as Z = Z 1/3 for large Z. Thus the ideal two-component plasma

can be regarded as an ionic OCP with eﬀective ionic charge Z.

Since the function L(K) has a singularity at K = 0 it cannot be expanded there and the second

moment does not exist. The microﬁeld distribution is given by PH (E) = H (η) /EH in terms of

Holtsmark’s function H(η)

with η = E/EH . Note that the Holtsmark distribution for the TCP has the same functional form

as either the ionic or the electronic OCP. The only diﬀerence is the deﬁnition of the Holtsmark

ﬁeld. Since the electronic or ionic Holtsmark ﬁelds may signiﬁcantly diﬀer from EH the shape of

the MFD for a OCP and a TCP may strongly diﬀer from each other even for ideal plasmas.

(ii) For the regularized Coulomb interaction given by Eq. (3), L(K) (from Eq. (24)) and all its

derivatives are regular at K = 0. Hence, all moments of the microﬁeld distribution exist. This

indicates that for large electric ﬁelds the microﬁeld distribution must decay exponentially. The

second moment can be obtained from Eq. (24) if we recall that for K → 0, L(K) ≃

for the bare Coulomb interaction L (K) ≃ (KEH)3/2. Hence, the microﬁeld distributions for the

(cid:11)

(cid:10)

ideal plasmas with bare and regularized Coulomb potentials behave similar at small electric ﬁelds.

B. Expression of the MFD through pair functions

It was ﬁrst noted by Morita [27] that the virial expansion of the Fourier transform of the MFD

T (K) is formally similar to that of the excess chemical potential. This was previously used to

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

express T (K) in terms of an eﬀective RDFs (see, e.g., [26]) involving the radiator and one of the

plasma particles. To generalize this method to the TCP we follow the procedure [6-30] and consider

the logarithmic derivative of Eq. (12)

functions between the radiator and the plasma particles in a ﬁctitious system whose interaction

complex pair correlation functions (or, alternatively through two real functions).

In addition

Eq. (33) yields the exact second moment given by Eq. (18).

The problem is now the evaluation of these correlation functions. Eq. (33) requires that the

complex correlation functions has to be known in the interval from 0 to K. One possibility is to

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

apply the integral equation technique with the complex interaction energy introduced above. Such

an approach has been previously employed for a OCP [28, 29, 30] and shows good agreement with

computer simulations. Here we adopt the exponential approximation (see, e.g., [21, 22, 23, 24,

25, 26, 46]) and generalize it to the TCP. This method is based on thermodynamic perturbation

theory [47]. The system with the potential energy U(K = 0) = U is chosen as reference system and

its structure is assumed to be known to a good approximation. The perturbation potential is then

given by U1 = −i (kBT ) (K · E) and we expand the correlation functions, Eqs. (30) and (31), with
respect to U1. Within ﬁrst order we obtain GαR (r, K) ≃ gαR (r) [1 + iK · E α (r)]. Here gαR (r) are
the actual RDF in the real system, Eqs. (19) and (20), and E α (r) = E (0)
α (r, 0). The electric ﬁelds
E α (r) may be interpreted as eﬀective electric ﬁelds in the ﬁctitious system which are independent

of K. Taking into account that hEi = 0 we obtain

E α (r) = Eα (r) +

(34)

Comparing Eq. (34) with Eq. (3.8) of Ref. [21] for the case of a OCP we remark that our present

derivation yields an additional factor 1/gαR(r) in front of the second term. Since gαβ(r) depend
only on |r1 − r2| the eﬀective electric ﬁelds in Eq. (34) can be represented as E α (r) = ˆrEα(r). The

Eα(r) can be expressed by the pair correlation functions and the single-particle potentials uαR (r)

(see Appendix A for details). Alternatively the Fourier transformed single-particle electric ﬁelds
can be written as Eα (k) = ˆkEα(k) which allows to express the eﬀective ﬁelds through the static

structure factors Sαβ (k).

We make now the ansatz,

GαR (r, K) = gαR (r) exp [iK · E α (r)]

and then integrate Eq. (33) with respect to λ, to ﬁnd

This must fulﬁll the exact second moment of the MFD given by Eq. (18) or (33), which is not

In Ref. [21] the eﬀective ﬁeld E(r) is assumed as a Debye-H¨uckel like screened interaction with

unknown screening length. This free parameter is then adjusted in such a way to satisfy Eq. (38).

The resulting predictions of APEX for the probability densities show excellent agreement with

numerical simulation data for the OCP. However, diﬃculties appear when one attempts to extend

the APEX scheme to a TCP, e.g. by assuming a Debye-H¨uckel like interaction separately for

the electrons and the ions and introducing two adjustable screening lengths. Then the sum rule

Eq. (38) with the exact second moment

becomes ambiguous as it allows for many diﬀerent

E2

choices of the adjustable screening lengths. This can be cured for ionic mixtures by demanding

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

that the second moment rule is satisﬁed species by species (see, e.g., [23, 24]). But this cannot be

employed for a TCP with attractive electron-ion interactions. Here the Debye-H¨uckel ansatz for

the electronic eﬀective ﬁeld is physically incompatible with Eq. (37) as discussed in Ref. [42].

We instead apply the potential of mean force (PMF) approximation [42, 48] which expresses

the eﬀective electric ﬁelds through the logarithmic derivative of pair correlation functions

Eα (r) =

[ln gαR (r)] .

(39)

Introducing Eqs. (39) in Eq. (37) automatically satisﬁes the sum-rule (18) without any adjustable

parameter. Relations (39) can be deduced from Eqs. (19), (20) and (34). To show this we con-

sider the pair correlation functions given by Eqs. (19) and (20). It is clear that in the thermo-
a + r(α)
dynamic limit these expressions are translationally invariant with respect to r(α)

a → r(α)

1

(a = 2, 3, ..., Nα). Making these transformations and calculating the logarithmic derivatives of

the pair correlation functions yield Eq. (39), where the eﬀective ﬁelds are given by Eq. (34). In

addition, Eq. (39) can be interpreted as a integro-diﬀerential equation for determining the pair

correlation functions, gαR. Thus, if the gαR(r) are known the MFD with the exact second moment

can be calculated using Eqs. (13), (36) and (39). This approach based on the exponential and the

PMF approximations is abbreviated as PMFEX in the following.

We summarize this section by the following remarks. The possibilities of the PMF approxima-

tion have already been noted by Alastuey et al. [22]. They found a superiority of the APEX to

the PMF approximation since the former reproduces the simulation data for classical ionic OCP

more accurately than the latter. We have conﬁrmed this by own investigations on the OCP. For

the TCP the outlined PMFEX approximation agrees quite well with the MD simulation results,

as we will show in the next section.

V. RESULTS

In Sec. IV we introduced and outlined the PMFEX approximation which links the MFD to the

RDFs. To obtain explicit results for the MFD the corresponding RDFs have to be determined ﬁrst.

This will be done by solving numerically the Hyper-Netted-Chain (HNC) integral equations for the

TCPs under consideration. The HNC method and the PMFEX approximation are tested both by

comparison of the resulting RDFs and MFD with those obtained by classical MD simulations. We

have done that for a wide range of coupling parameters Γei and for two speciﬁc rather distinct cases
H+ (ne = ni) and Al13+ (ne = 13ni) TCPs with symmetric and asymmetric density distributions

between plasma species, respectively. For simplicity we assume bare Coulomb electron-electron
and ion-ion interactions with δee ≃ 0 and δii ≃ 0 while the parameter δei/a = ¯δ scaled in the
Wigner-Seitz radius a = [4π (ne + ni) /3]−1/3 varies from 0.1 to 0.4.

A. Numerical treatments

To determine the RDFs gαR(r) the HNC equations (see, e.g., Refs. [48, 49])

for the total correlation functions hαβ (r) = gαβ (r) − 1 and the direct correlation functions cαβ(r)

are considered. This has to be done for a three-component system of electrons, ions and the radiator

in general. Here we assume that the radiator is one of the plasma ions ZR = Z, i.e. gαR(r) → gαi(r),

which reduces Eqs. (40) and (41) to the HNC-scheme for a TCP with mutual interactions uαβ(r)

(see Eq. (3)). The resulting coupled equations (40) and (41) are solved numerically by an iterative

scheme which closely follows the implementation discussed in detail in Ref. [50]. Within our
numerical treatment a parameter regime with σei = σ = Γei/¯δ < σc(Z, ¯δ) is accessible, where the
critical value σc for ¯δ = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 takes the values σc ≃ 8.32, 8.5, 13.4 and σc ≃ 7.33, 6.66, 7.0

(40)

(41)

for H+ and Al13+ TCPs, respectively. Beyond this value the numerical procedure does either not

converge or ends up in unphysical solutions. A similar behavior has been reported in [43] for the

case of an ion embedded in electrons. With the RDFs provided by the HNC-scheme the MFD,

i.e. P (E), is then calculated via Eqs. (13), (36) and (39) by standard numerical diﬀerentiation and

integration methods [51].

In the MD simulations the classical equations of motion are numerically integrated for Ni ions

and Ne electrons interacting via uαβ(r) and contained in a cubic cell with periodic boundary

conditions. To account for the long range of the Coulomb interaction the forces are calculated

by an Ewald sum [52, 53]. The numerical propagation is accomplished by a standard Velocity-

Verlet algorithm [54, 55] extended by a hierarchical treatment of close colliding particles which

are propagated as subsystems (see [56] for details) and using an adaptive time step. Such MD

simulations have already been extensively tested and successfully applied for investigations of the

dynamic response of a TCP with regularized potentials, see [57, 58].

The actual simulations run with N = Ni + Ne = 2002 particles and proceed in two phases. An

initial equilibration starts from a random sampling of positions and velocities and relaxes towards

the equilibrium distribution of desired temperature by dynamic propagation with velocity rescaling.

The subsequent simulations are performed in the microcanonical ensemble, where their accuracy

and stability can be monitored using the total energy. The MFD and the RDFs are sampled during

the simulations from the known forces on the particles and their positions as a time average over
pl,e, where ωpl,e = (nee2/mǫ0)1/2 is the

the total running time τ which was typically τ ≈ 700ω−1

electronic plasma frequency.

By the MD simulations basically all correlations and many-body eﬀects of classical many-body

systems can be taken into account. Limitations arise mainly from the ﬁnite particle number and

the system size, e.g.
in connection with the screening of the interactions on a typical screening
length λD. Since λD should be smaller than the size L of the simulation box and L/λD ∝ Γ1/2
ei

,

the MD-technique works here more favorable at large coupling (Γei > 1) while the limit of weak

coupling (Γei ≪ 1) requires a strong increase of the simulation box, i.e. of the particle number.

B. Correlation functions

In Figs. 1-3 we compare the RDFs calculated either from the HNC scheme or MD simulations

for a H+-plasma. Only gei(r) and gii(r) are plotted as gee(r) = gii(r) for hydrogen both in the

HNC and MD treatment (within numerical ﬂuctuations). In Fig. 1 we explore the dependence in

the regularization parameter δ at a ﬁxed electron-electron coupling Γee = 0.1, while in Fig. 2 Γee is

varied. Both approaches agree perfectly in the range of parameters covered in these ﬁgures. Due

to the regularization of the ion-electron interaction the RDF gei(r) is ﬁnite in the limit r → 0. A

non-linear Debye-H¨uckel approximation for gei(r) has been proposed in Ref. [43]. Adopting this
with R = 1+ ¯δ (3Γei)1/2, where the dependence

estimate for TCPs we obtain gei(0) ≃ exp

Γei/R¯δ

on the ion charge Z is included in the coupling parameter Γei. The RDFs show indeed the expected
(cid:1)

(cid:0)

growth of correlations with increased coupling and decreased regularization parameter. For very

strong electron-electron coupling deviations between the HNC scheme and the MD simulations

begin to appear as shown in Fig. 3 for Γee = 4.0 and σH+ ≃ 12.5. There we are at the edge of the

HNC convergence region and classically bound states show up in the MD simulations.

The symmetry between the correlation functions gee(r) and gii(r) breaks down for Al13+-plasma.

In Fig. 4 we compare the HNC and MD radial distribution functions for ﬁxed Γee = 0.01 varying

the regularization parameter δ. Since Γii ≫ Γee strong correlation eﬀects are expected for gii. The

increasing ”correlation hole” is clearly visible in Fig. 5 where the HNC and MD radial distribution
functions gii(r) and gei(r) are plotted for a ﬁxed ¯δ = 0.4 and varying coupling strengths Γee. Again,

for all these parameters the HNC scheme agrees perfectly with the MD simulations. As shown in

Fig. 6 deviations occur in the electron-electron RDF gee(r) at small r for strong coupling Γee = 0.2,

σAl13+ ≃ 6.6. These are due to the enhancement of the electronic density around an ion, which also

increases the probability of close electronic distances and results in the maxima in gee at distances

r . a. This eﬀect is obviously overestimated in the HNC approach and it is more pronounced for

highly charged ions like Al13+ and less important for H+. The regularization of the electron-ion

interaction has no visible inﬂuence on the correlation functions gee(r) and gii(r) (see Figs. 1 and 4).

C. Microﬁeld distribution

We now turn to the MFDs at the charged reference point which is chosen to be one of the

plasma ions, ZR = Z. For our analysis it is instructive to consider ﬁrst the second moment which

can be used to check and compare the diﬀerent treatments PMFEX, HNC, MD, and can provide

some information about the shape of the MFD, although this is not suﬃcient to construct it. For

a bare ion-ion Coulomb interaction the second term in the rhs of Eq. (21) vanishes and the second

moment

E2

receives contribution only from the ﬁrst term involving gei. In the limit of an ideal

(cid:11)

(cid:10)

TCP (Γαβ → 0) gei(r) can be replaced by unity. This yields

OCP (see, e.g., [21]). In this sense the ideal TCP behaves like an ionic OCP with Γ = Γii. The

second moments calculated from Eq. (21) using a HNC radial distribution function gei(r) are shown

in Figs. 7 and 8 as a function of Γee for hydrogen and aluminum TCPs, respectively. The dashed

straight lines represent
δ up to the critical values σc = Γ(c)

(cid:11)

(cid:10)

The normalized MFDs from PMFEX and MD are compared in Figs. 9-18 where the electric

microﬁelds are scaled in units of the Holtsmark ﬁeld EH (see Eq. (25)). For each distribution we

have also calculated the second moment as a control parameter and found a quite good agreement

between Eq. (21) and the MD simulations. The MFDs for hydrogen with coupling parameters

Γee = Γii = 1 and for Al13+ plasmas with Γee = 0.1 and Γii = 7.19 are shown in Fig. 9 and 10,

respectively. The dashed curves are the Holtsmark MFDs for a TCP with regularized Coulomb

potential. Note that the Holtsmark MFD is Z-dependent here (see Eqs. (13) and (24)). To

demonstrate the importance of attractive interactions we also plotted the MFDs P0(E) resulting

from the corresponding electronic and ionic OCPs with Γee and Γii, respectively (open circles). To

that end the distribution Q0(E) of the total ﬁeld E = E1 + E2 is calculated as

Q0 (E) =

Qe (E1) Qi (E2) δ (E − E1 − E2) dE1dE2 ≡

(42)

P0(E)
4πE2

Z

from the MFD of the ionic OCP at a charged point Qi (E2) and of the electronic OCP at a neutral

reference point Qe (E1). The distribution Q0 (E) thus represents the MFD in a TCP assuming that

the ion-electron attractive interaction is switched oﬀ. Here Qe (E1) and Qi (E2) are taken from

MD simulations of an OCP.

Systematic dependencies of the MFD on δ and Γ are shown in Figs. 11-16. For ﬁxed Γ the

maximum of P (E) shifts only slightly to lower ﬁeld strengths E with increasing δ, see Figs. 11 and

12, while the maximum itself increases with δ. This is related to the largest possible single-particle

ﬁeld |Ee(0)| = eF /2δ2, which an electron can produce at the ion. Thus the nearest neighbor

electronic MFD vanishes for electric ﬁelds larger than |Ee(0)|, and smaller δ will result in larger

contributions to P (E) at higher ﬁelds E with a corresponding reduction of P (E) at small ﬁelds. In

order to demonstrate the enhanced probability of large ﬁelds at small δ and the behavior of PMFEX

and MD treatments at large ﬁelds, the MFD is plotted in Figs. 13 and 14 in a double-logarithmic

manner. From Fig. 13 it can be deduced that the behavior of the MFD at large ﬁelds in H+ plasma

with ¯δ = 0.2 and Γee = 1 is similar to the nearest neighbor electronic distribution considered in

detail in Ref. [43]. In this case the MFD is strongly reduced at E > |Ee(0)| ≃ 12.5EH .

For ﬁxed δ and increasing Γ the MFDs for hydrogen (Fig. 15) and Al13+ (Fig. 16) show diﬀerent

behavior. For hydrogen, like for an ionic OCP, the growing correlations shift the maximum of the

MFD towards lower electric ﬁelds. In the Al13+-TCP, P (E) ﬁrst follows this trend, but then, for

further increasing Γ, the maximum turns back to higher ﬁeld strengths. This can be attributed to

the growing contribution of the attractive electron-ion interaction and close ion-electron conﬁgu-

rations, which are particularly important for a TCP with highly charged ions. These dependencies

are very well reproduced by the PMFEX predictions.

The agreement with the MD data is nearly perfect in most of the studied cases, both for the

H+-TCP and the Al13+-TCP (Figs. 9-16). The PMFEX approximation remains accurate also up

to high electric ﬁelds where the MD data are characterized by strong ﬂuctuations (see Figs. 13 and

14). Deviations emerge only for strongly coupling situations with large Γ and σ. One example is
the case of strongly coupled hydrogen with Γee = 1 and ¯δ = 0.2, i.e. σ ≃ 6.3 (dotted line and open

triangles in Fig. 15, see also Fig. 13). Here PMFEX and MD results diﬀer considerably, although

the HNC treatment is accurate in this case (see Fig. 2). To understand this feature better we recall

that within PMFEX the Fourier transformed MFD, T (K), fulﬁlls exactly the second moment

relation (21) in the limit K → 0. As discussed above only electrons contribute to the second

moment since the role of ions is negligible (the second term in Eq. (21)). Because of Eq. (36) small

values of K correspond to large values of the local electric ﬁeld. One expects therefore that the

PMFEX yields good results if there are many electrons near the ion. On the other hand, for a

large electron-electron repulsion Γee = 1 and a light ion like hydrogen, the electrons tend to exert

only small ﬁelds in the ion, for which the quality of the PMFEX is less obvious.

With increased coupling also the shape of the MFD starts to change. First by a broadening

of the maximum, and then by the appearance of a shoulder as also reported in Ref. [43] which

then gets more and more pronounced and ﬁnally develops into a second maximum. For the Al13+

TCP in a parameter regime still below the critical values, the MFD is characterized here by the

formation of the characteristic shape shown in Fig. 17. The HNC approximation still gives the

correct gii(r) and gei(r) and the PMFEX well reproduces the broadening and the speciﬁc shape of

the MFD. With respect to gee(r), however, deviations between HNC and MD emerge (similar to

those shown for δ = 0.4a, Γee = 0.2 in Fig. 6), although the electron-electron coupling (Γee = 0.1)

is still small. The strong ion-electron coupling increases the electron density near the ion which

introduces additional correlations between electrons, see the discussion above in Sec. VB. This

will, however, not aﬀect the quality of the PMFEX approximation, since the gee(r) is not needed

for the calculation of the MFD at the impurity ion (see Eqs. (13) and (36)). An example for a

second maximum is given by the strongly coupled hydrogen of Fig. 18, where the parameters are

close to the critical values. This regime is characterized by the population of bound states and the

formation of a separate contribution to P (E) at high ﬁelds which is mainly due to the electrons.

Here occur signiﬁcant deviations between the HNC approach and MD simulations in the RDF

gei(r) (see Fig. 3) and the PMFEX approximation cannot predict the shape of the MFD, even

not qualitatively. But, for coupling parameters, where a classical approach is justiﬁed, i.e. when

bound states are unimportant, the PMFEX approach turns out to be a very reliable method for

calculating the MFD of a TCP with attractive interaction.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this paper our objective was to investigate the microﬁeld distributions in a two-component

plasmas with attractive electron-ion interactions. Attention has been focused on testing the pre-

dictions of the PMFEX approximation based on the HNC treatment of static correlations by

confronting it with the MFDs obtained from MD simulations. One of the basic assumptions of the

model considered here is the regularization of the attractive Coulomb interaction at short distances

to introduce quantum diﬀraction eﬀects in the employed classical approach.

Two speciﬁc rather distinct cases, H+ (ne = ni) and Al13+ (ne = 13ni) two-component plasmas

with symmetric and largely asymmetric density distributions between plasma species were con-

sidered. For simplicity we assume bare Coulomb electron-electron and ion-ion interactions while
the parameter ¯δ for the regularized ion-electron potential varies from 0.1 to 0.4. The coupling

strength between plasma particles is measured by the coupling parameters Γαβ with α, β = e, i
and by the ion-electron potential at the origin in units of kBT , σ = Γei/¯δ. Our treatment is
limited to a parameter regime with σ < σc(Z, ¯δ), where the critical value σc for 0.1 ≤ ¯δ ≤ 0.4
varies 8.32 ≤ σc ≤ 13.4 and 6.66 ≤ σc ≤ 7.33 for H+ and Al13+ TCPs, respectively. Within this

parameter regime the gαβ(r) from the HNC equations agree well with the MD simulations. Beyond

these critical σ the HNC equations do either not converge or end up in unphysical solutions while

the MD simulations remain eﬀective at these strong coupling regimes. A further increase of the

coupling parameters also leads to the formation of classical strongly bound electronic states with

no corresponding quantum counterpart. Also the microﬁeld distributions obtained from the HNC

via the PMFEX approximation agree excellently with the MFDs from the MD simulations except

of some cases close to the critical Γ, σ. This is somewhat surprising since a similar approximation

studied for the OCP deviates from MD simulations (see, e.g., [21, 22]). Therefore we have also

tested the PMFEX approximation for an OCP, which in contrast to the TCP turns out to be poor

when compared with MD simulations although the exact second moment is satisﬁed within the

PMFEX. The success of the PMFEX approximation for the TCP is a consequence of the attractive

interaction and is related to the additional positive electronic part in Eq. (36) which accounts for

the electric ﬁelds created by the electrons at the ions. Obviously, the attractive interactions in

a TCP favour conﬁgurations with large electric ﬁelds created at the ion which are well described

within the PMFEX approximation. On the other hand, in a regime dominated by small local ﬁelds

and hence by small local electronic density the PMFEX deviates from the MD. This feature has

been clearly observed for a single ion embedded in an electronic OCP in Ref. [43]. For the TCP, an

example is the case of strongly coupled hydrogen with Γee = 1, δ = 0.2a in Figs. 13 and 15. Here

some improvement of the PMFEX scheme is required. Such work and the application of PMFEX

to the case of a neutral radiator are in progress.

APPENDIX A: THE EFFECTIVE ELECTRIC FIELDS

In order to reduce the three-dimensional integration in Eq. (34) to a one-dimensional integra-

tion and to express the eﬀective ﬁelds through scalar potentials uαR(r) we consider the following

expression

where

Z

dr1uβR (r1) [gαβ (|r − r1|) − 1] = 4π

β (r, ρ) [gαβ(ρ) − 1] ρdρ,

Obviously, the gradient of Eq. (A1) yields the second term in Eq. (34). Consequently, recalling the

G(0)

β (r, ρ) =

2r

r+ρ

|r−ρ|

uβR(r′)r′dr′.

spherical symmetry of the single particle ﬁelds, Eq. (34) can be alternatively expressed through

one-dimensional integrals

Eα (r) = Eα (r) +

qβnβ

β (r, ρ) [gαβ (ρ) − 1] ρdρ.

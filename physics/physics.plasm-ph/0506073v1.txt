Abstract

The variational principle for linear stability of three-dimensional, in-
homogenious, compressible, moving magnetized plasma is suggested. The
principle is “softer” (easier to be satisﬁed) than all previously known varia-
tional stability conditions. The key point of the analysis is a conservation
in variations of new integrals inherent in the linearized equation of the
motion that was not earlier discussed in the literature.

PACS46.15.Cc, 52.30.Cv

It is well known that stability of the static equilibrium of magnetized plasma
can be described by so-called “energy principle” [1]. The principle claims that if
the second variation of the potential energy, W , of the system “plasma-magnetic
ﬁeld” is positive deﬁnite near the equilibrium point, then this point is stable.
Suﬃciency of the claim follows from the Lyapunov stability theorem, and neces-
sity can also be proved [1]. Note that the above mentioned second variation of
the potential energy corresponds exactly to the potential energy of the linearized
equation system.

The main drawback of the principle is that there always may be neutral
perturbations which do not perturb any physical quantity – and, therefore, W
as well. Thus, the second variation of the potential energy can be guaranteed
to be only positive semi-deﬁnite. In other words, using the energy principle [1],
one can talk about spectral stability only, namely, about presence or absence of
imaginary frequencies in the spectrum of the linearized force operator (nonlinear
stability needs an analysis of neutral perturbations – see, e.g., [2]). Continuing
this logic, we restrict ourselves with linearized equations.

The attempt of using the similar approach to investigate stability of moving
plasma performed by Frieman and Rotenberg [3] was not so lucky, although the
energy principle was formally obtained. Their result can be brieﬂy described as

follows. Consider the linearized equation of motion for plasma displacement ξ
in the frame of ideal one-ﬂuid magnetohydrodynamics,

ρ¨ξ + 2ρ(V·∇) ˙ξ − F(ξ) = 0 ,

(1)

where the linearized force operator,

F(ξ) = −δρ(V·∇)V − ρ(δV·∇)V − ρ(V·∇)δV
− ∇δp + (∇ × δB) × B + (∇ × B) × δB ,

is combined of usual perturbed quantities,

δρ = −∇·(ρξ),

δV = (V·∇)ξ − (ξ·∇)V ,

δp = −ξ·∇p − γp ∇·ξ,

δB = ∇ × (ξ × B)

(note that δV denotes here only the part of full Eulerian velocity perturbation –
the part, which survives even for time-independent displacements, ξ). Station-
ary plasma density, ρ, velocity, V, pressure, p, and magnetic ﬁeld, B, satisfy
the following equilibrium conditions:

ρ(V·∇)V + ∇p = (∇ × B) × B ,
∇·(ρV) = 0 ,
V·∇p + γp ∇·V = 0 ,
∇ × (V × B) = 0 .

Dot means a partial time-derivative, γ means the adiabatic exponent. Force
operator is proved to be self-adjoint in the following sense,

while the second term in (1) is obviously antisymmetric:

η·F(ξ) d3r =

ξ·F(η) d3r ,

η·ρ(V·∇)ξ d3r = −

Multiplying Eq. (1) by ˙ξ and integrating over the whole space, we found the
energy conservation in the form ˙E = 0, where

Minimizing E over ˙ξ, we approach to the energy principle by Frieman-Rotenberg,

E(t) =

(3)

Contrary to the static case (V = 0), in which condition (3) appears to be both
suﬃcient and necessary for linear stability, in the case of V 6= 0, condition (3)
is normally too strong, and never can be satisﬁed except of ﬁeld-aligned ﬂows
(V ∼ B)[3] or of those which may be reduced to the ﬁeld-aligned ﬂows (see,
e.g., [4]).

Energy principle (3) may be improved by use of the Arnold conjecture [5]-
[7], following which we have to add to the energy (2) the set of other known
integrals of the motion. Speaking in other words, variables ˙ξ and ξ in (2)
are not absolutely independent but subject to the constraints resulting from
conservation of other integrals of the motion.

Such an improved principle was derived by Ilgisonis and Pastukhov [8], then
it was veriﬁed by Hameiri [9]. It was also re-obtained [10] with help of Pﬁrsch &
Morrison’s method [11] of dynamically accessed perturbations. That stability
condition is currently the best among the known ones, although it is still not
appropriate for arbitrary stationary plasma ﬂow.

For the linearized equation (1), the Ilgisonis & Pastukhov extra invariants

can be written in terms of neutral perturbation ξN :

F(ξN ) = 0,

∂tξN = 0 .

Multiplying Eq. (1) by ξN and integrating again over the space, we have ˙I = 0,
where

I =

(ρ ˙ξ·ξN + 2ρξN (V·∇)ξ) d3r .

Z

For the system with nested set of magnetic surfaces, ψ(r) = const, ξN may be
generally represented as

where u = B/ρ, v = D/ρ, and D is a divergence-free frozen-in-plasma vector,
tangential to the same magnetic surfaces, ψ(r) = const, but diﬀerent from B,

ξN = λu(ψ)u + λv(ψ)v ,

B × D = ρ∇ψ

– see [8, 9] for explanations of how D can be built-up. For λv = 0 in (5), con-
servation of I corresponds to the cross-helicity invariance, which is well known
contrary to more general quantity I. Note that taking into account (5), (6), the
second term under the integral in Eq. (4) can also be written as

(4)

(5)

(6)

or as

−2ξ·ρ(V·∇)ξN ,

ρξN ·(V·∇)ξ + ρV·(ξN ·∇)ξ ,

for absolutely arbitrary functions λu,v(ψ).

It is very important that Eq. (1) allows for some extra set of invariants
diﬀerent from (2) and (4). Indeed, diﬀerentiating Eq. (1) with respect to time,
then multiplying it by ¨ξ and integrating, we found – like in the case of energy but
using once again original equation of motion (1) – that the following quantity,

E2 =

is conserved. This invariant is exact for linearized dynamics (1), and cannot
be reduced to the conservation of energy (2).
In principle, we may continue
the procedure and get in the same manner an inﬁnite set of similar invariants.
However, to investigate a stability, it might be suﬃcient to involve into our
analysis only ﬁnite number of the invariants. Here we show that taking into
account even one of them, E2, it appears to be possible to improve the stability
condition signiﬁcantly.

Note that being varied separately (i.e., when ˙ξ is independent), invariant (7)
results in the same Frieman-Rotenberg condition of semi-positive deﬁniteness
of quadratic form (3) based on F-operator. To improve stability condition, we
will consider the functional

U = E + µE2 − I

to be varied over ξ and ˙ξ, subject to the independent conservation of the inte-
grals, E2 and I. Explicitly,

Putting µ → 0 in Eqs. (9), (10), we approach to the Ilgisonis-Pastukhov-Hameiri
condition [8, 9]. Indeed, we have at µ → 0:

˙ξ → ξN , U → UIP H =

where ξN satisﬁes (5), and λu,v:

Z

In this limit, we have not really used the condition of E2-conservation. Note that
ξ·F(ξ) d3r/2, and, therefore, the Ilgisonis-Pastukhov-Hameiri con-
UIP H ≥ −
dition, UIP H ≥ 0, is ”softer” than the condition (3) by Frieman and Rotenberg.
However, it is still not appropriate for arbitrary ﬂow, in which V is not parallel
to B. The sign-indeﬁnite term, ξ·F(ξ) , contains the high-order ξ-derivatives
and, therefore, can always prevail on the positive term ρξ2
N (see [9] for more
details).

Now let us account for small but ﬁnite µ. Solving Eq. (10) by iterations in

µ, we found

where we used the notation

˙ξ ≈ ξN − 2µ(V·∇)¨ξ0 ,

¨ξ0 = F(ξ)/ρ − 2(V·∇)ξN .

Stability condition is expressed again by functional U depending on ξ:

Here ξN and ¨ξ0 are deﬁned by Eqs. (5), (12), and also depend on ξ.

respect to previous one, UIP H ≥ 0, that it has a sense for arbitrary (not only
ﬁeld-aligned) ﬂow and, therefore, may have a practical merit.

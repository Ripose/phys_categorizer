Abstract

New exact solutions of the steady and incompressible 2D MHD equations in polar
coordinates are presented. The solutions describe the process of reconnective mag-
netic annihilation in a curved current layer. They are particularly interesting for
modeling magnetic reconnection in solar ﬂares caused by the interaction of three
photospheric magnetic sources.

1 Introduction

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in many areas of plasma
physics. In particular it is proved to play a key role in active phenomena
such as solar ﬂares and geomagnetic substorms [1,2]. Since the pioneering
works of Parker [3], Sweet [4] and Petschek [5], several exact solutions describ-
ing reconnective annihilation in two dimensions in Cartesian coordinates were
discovered e.g. by Sonnerup and Priest [6], Craig and Henton [7] and Priest
et al. [8]. The aim of this paper is to present similar solutions for a curvilinear
geometry in a form that makes it possible to model a class of solar ﬂares.

and resistivity which are described by the equation of motion

The equations (1) and (2) are written in a dimensionless form. The distances
have been rescaled with respect to a characteristic length Le. The magnetic
ﬁeld and the plasma velocity have been normalized respectively to Be and
vAe which are characteristic values of the magnetic ﬁeld and of the Alfv´en
velocity. The nondimensional resistivity η corresponds to the inverse magnetic
Reynolds number. The current density ~j is determined by the Ampere’s law

~j =

~B.

∇ ×
Assume that the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds lie in one plane and do not
depend on the z-coordinate perpendicular to this plane. Then the electric
ﬁeld ~E is uniform and parallel to the z-axis. In the plane where the magnetic
and velocity ﬁeld lie we use polar coordinates (r, θ) related to the Cartesian
coordinates (x, y) as follows

x = r sin θ,

y = r cos θ

where d > 0 so that the pole is below the line y = 0. The above mentioned
Le is the distance from the origin of the coordinate system. Further we re-
strict our consideration to the domain (y > 0, r < 1) in the corona, since the
subphotospheric ﬂows are described by other equations which at least have to
take into account the gravity. Due to (3) the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds can
be expressed in terms of stream and ﬂux functions ψ and A, respectively. In
polar coordinates this yields

3 Form of the solutions

We seek solutions in the form

where A1, ψ1, A0 and ψ0 are unknown functions of r. Then the radial and
azimuthal components of the magnetic and velocity ﬁelds are

A(r, θ) = A1(r)θ + A0(r),

By substituting the ansatz (10) and (11) into (7) and (8) one obtains expres-
sions depending linearly on θ. This means that in each of these expressions the
coeﬃcient of θ and the sum of the terms not depending on θ have to vanish.
This yields a set of four ordinary diﬀerential equations which splits into two
subsystems. The ﬁrst of them is nonlinear and includes only A1 and ψ1, so

4 Ideal solutions

Let us consider ﬁrst the case of ideal MHD, that is when η = 0. In this limit
it is easy to see from eq. (14) that ψ1 must be proportional to A1, that is

where α is an arbitrary constant. By using this result in (13) we obtain the
equation

where c1, c2, a and b are arbitrary constants. From (20), (12) and (4), it is
easy to see that in the presence of a non-vanishing electric ﬁeld E the θ-
components of the magnetic and velocity ﬁelds as well as the current density
have a singularity at the radius r = exp(
rc, which is further on
called the critical radius. In ideal MHD this is an indication of reconnection.
The singularities disappear at E = 0 and in this case the arc r = rc turns into
the separatrix line emanating from the null point (rc, 0). Thus, the electric
ﬁeld is responsible for the appearance of the singularities at the separatrix:
in our solution it drives the shearing ﬂows across the other separatrix line,
which is exactly the situation where the magnetic ﬂux has to pile up at the
separatrix aligned with the shear [9]. The ﬁrst example of such a solution in
a more simple geometry has been discovered by Craig and Henton [7], which
showed also that the corresponding singularity is resolved by resistivity. It is
shown below that this is valid for our solution as well.

5 Resistive solutions

To resolve the above singularity we adopt the method of matched asymptotic
expansions by analogy with the work of Priest et al. [8], where it is used for
solving a similar problem in Cartesian rather than cylindrical geometry. One
can use such a method, because the dimensionless resistivity η is very small in

4

6
the solar corona as well as in many other astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.
To solve the problem in this case the domain is separated in two diﬀerent
regions, a narrow layer enclosing the singularity and the rest of the plane.
In each of the regions we ﬁrst ﬁnd the appropriate asymptotic expansions of
the resistive solutions, then we match and combine them into a composite
solution, which is approximately valid in both regions.
The boundary conditions assumed for the unknowns in our problem are the
following:

A1(1) = Bre,

ψ1(1) = vre,

A1(rc) = 0,

ψ1(rc) = 0,

(21)

(22)

A0′(rc) = 0,
(23)
where Bre and vre are some values of radial components of magnetic and veloc-
& √η) the resistive terms
ity ﬁelds, respectively. In the outer region (

in (14) and (16) are small and so the outer solution coincides in the lower or-
der approximation with the ideal solution considered in the previous section.
Using boundary conditions (21) and the above deﬁnition of rc, eq. (19) can be
written as

(24)

In this form, the outer solution (24) satisﬁes the inner boundary conditions
(22) and so it can be used as an inner solution. A similar fact has been observed
by Priest et al. [8] in the “Cartesian” analogue of our solution. The problem
thus reduces to ﬁnd the inner solutions for A0′ and ψ0′. We assume that the
following expansions

A0′ = A0

0′ + √ηA1
0′,

ψ0′ = ψ0

0 ′ + √ηψ1
0 ′,

(25)

are valid in the inner region: These expressions are inserted into eq. (15)
and (16) where A1 and ψ1 are replaced by the ﬁrst three terms of the series
expansions of (24) about rc. The two resulting equations are then rewritten
in terms of the inner variable

The terms with the same powers of η are gathered in these equations to equate
separately to zero the corresponding coeﬃcients of the two lowest powers of
η. This yields us four equations for the unknowns A0
0 ′. Their
solution, rewritten in terms of the variable r, determine approximate expres-
sions for A0′ and ψ0′ in the vicinity of rc. The latter is expanded then by small
η at a ﬁxed r and matched with the series expansion of the outer solution
about r = rc. Finally, the matched outer and inner solutions are combined
into the following composite solution:

The corresponding magnetic and velocity ﬁeld lines are plotted in Fig. 1. One
can see from this plot that the separatrix line r = rc is the same for both
sets of lines, while the other separatrices are diﬀerent. The separatrices inter-
sect at the magnetic null point (r = rc, θ = 0) and at the stagnation point
2). Such a structure implies the presence
(r = rc, θ = (arc + b/rc)krc
of a shearing component of the ﬂow parallel to the ﬁrst separatrix r = rc
and transverse to the second magnetic separatrix. As mentioned above, this
is a reason for the current layer formation along the ﬁrst separatrix, which is
conﬁrmed by the corresponding distribution of current density in Fig. 1.
In comparison with its “Cartesian” analogue [8] the obtained solution is much
less symmetric. It describes the plasma ﬂow in curvilinear magnetic conﬁgura-
tion with an arc-like current layer separating a dipole-like structure from the
surrounding unipolar ﬁeld. This is particularly interesting for modeling mag-
netic reconnection in solar ﬂares. In fact there are observational evidences that
many ﬂares occur in conﬁgurations with three magnetic ﬂux concentrations
on the photosphere [10]. The proof of this conjecture as well as the detailed
investigations of other solutions with λ
= 0 will be presented in a forthcoming

paper.

6 Conclusions

Solutions to the steady incompressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics equa-
tions in a curvilinear geometry are derived and discussed. These solutions
describe a process where a sheared ﬂow crosses a separatrix of the magnetic
ﬁeld and a curved current layer is formed in correspondence to the other sepa-
ratrix. These solutions are the analogous in polar coordinates of the solutions
in Cartesian coordinates discussed in [7] but with respect to the latter they
present some new feature. In particular the conﬁgurations of the magnetic
and velocity ﬁeld in the curved geometry is much less symmetric than the
one described by the solutions in Cartesian coordinates. Finally the possible
applications of our solutions to the modeling of solar ﬂares are mentioned.

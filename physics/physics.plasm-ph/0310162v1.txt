Abstract

We present a simulation study of the charging of a dust grain immersed in a plasma, considering

the eﬀect of electron emission from the grain (thermionic eﬀect). It is shown that the OML theory

is no longer reliable when electron emission becomes large: screening can no longer be treated

within the Debye-Huckel approach and an attractive potential well forms, leading to the possibility

of attractive forces on other grains with the same polarity. We suggest to perform laboratory

experiments where emitting dust grains could be used to create non-conventional dust crystals or

macro-molecules.

Introduction: The study of charging of objects immersed in a plasma is a classic problem

of plasma physics with many applications [1], ranging from space problems to dusty plasmas

to probe theory for plasma diagnostics.

Often the description of the interaction between a plasma and an object can be reduced

to the progressive charging of the object by the plasma particles that hit the surface of the

object and are captured. In absence of other processes, the higher mobility of the electrons

leads to more electron captures by the object, which tends to charge negatively. However,

in certain conditions, other processes need to be considered. For example, if the object

immersed in the plasma is suﬃciently warm, a signiﬁcant number of electrons can be emitted

by thermionic eﬀect, altering the balance between electron and ion captures, reducing the

negative charge on the object, or even reversing its sign. An example of this process is given

by small objects entering the Earth’s atmosphere (meteoroids). Recent work has shown that

the heating of the meteoroids, due to their interaction with the atmosphere, can produce a

considerable thermionic emission which leads to positively charged meteoroids [2]. Similarly,

the presence of UV light sources can lead to photoemission which also leads to a current

of electrons emitted by the object and produces a reduction or an inversion of the object

charge [3].

In the present work, we will consider how the process of electron emission changes the

process of charging of an object immersed in a plasma, considering self-consistently the

process of charge collection on the object and the screening by the surrounding plasma. We

focus particularly on the process of thermionic emission, but the results also apply to the

similar case of photoemission. Two primary conclusions are reached. First, the process of

electron emission by the object reduces the charges as expected by the orbit motion limited

(OML) theory [1]. However, the quantitative eﬀect of the thermionic emission predicted by

the OML is accurate only for small objects. We ﬁnd that, for objects larger than the Debye

length, the OML becomes grossly inaccurate. Second, in presence of thermionic emissions

when the object is charged positively, the screening potential develops an attractive well.

In contrast with the typical monotonic behavior predicted by the Debye-Huckel theory, we

observe a potential well due to the presence of an excess of electron charge trapped around

the emitting object.

Looking at the literature, we have found experimental evidence that heated emissive

probes can determine a non-monotonic behaviour of the plasma potential [4]. This is com-

2

monly called the virtual cathode, namely a region of zero electric ﬁeld associated with a local

excess of negative charges. However, as far as we know, the importance of this mechanism on

the charging process occurring in a dusty plasma and its implications has not yet been rec-

ognized. The consequences of this behaviour of the shielding potential can be considerable

since potential wells can provide regions of attraction for other objects with the same sign of

charge. Although the present mechanism is not the only instance when particles of the same

charge immersed in a plasma can attract each other (see [5] and references therein), the

mechanism presented here can be tested experimentally. We propose that UV light added

to plasma crystal experiments can create the conditions for the formation of attractive po-

tentials between dust particles. Such experiments would be best conducted in microgravity

(e.g. on the International Space Station Alpha) where other attractive mechanisms (e.g.

wake ﬁeld [1, 6], ion ﬂow alignment [5]) are not present.

Charging in Presence of Thermionic Emission: We consider a spherical, isolated

dust grain of radius a immersed in a neutral, unmagnetized plasma consisting of electrons

and singly charged ions. The grain is at rest, located at r = 0. Electrons and ions have

diﬀerent masses, me and mi, and temperatures, Te and Ti, respectively. The grain has a

surface temperature Td and can emit thermionic electrons. The characteristic lengths of

the system are the electron Debye length λDe, the ion Debye length λDi and the linearized
Debye length λDlin, deﬁned as 1/λ2

Di. The system under examination has

Dlin = 1/λ2

De + 1/λ2

spherical symmetry and can be best treated in spherical geometry.

In the simplest model, neglecting any emissions from the dust particle surface, the grain is

charged by the surrounding plasma (primary charging). Initially, electrons are more mobile

than ions and charge the grain negatively by hitting its surface. Hence, the grain acquires

a negative potential and creates an electric ﬁeld that repels electrons and attracts ions. A

dynamical equilibrium is eventually reached when the electron current to the dust is equal

to the ion current. The primary charging mechanism has been studied extensively over the

years, both analytically and numerically. The most widely used approach is the OML theory

[1]. The OML provides expressions for the electron and ion currents to the dust surface as

a function of the dust ﬂoating potential φ(a). The steady state is reached when the dust

potential is such that the ion and electron currents to the dust are equal. Once φ(a) is

known, the electric charge on the dust is determined by QOML = 4πε0a (1 + a/λDlin) φ(a)

if one considers a Debye-Huckel potential around the dust with screening length given by

3

λDlin. Indeed, the OML theory is a good approximation for thick sheaths where a ≪ λD,

but breaks down for a ≫ λD [7, 8, 9].

The presence of electron emission from the dust (either photoelectric or thermionic) aﬀects

crucially the potential distribution around the dust. In this letter we focus on thermionic

emission. The starting point for a theoretical analysis of the thermionic current is the

Sommerfeld model of a metal where the energy states are uniformly distributed and the

free electrons have a Fermi distribution of probability to occupy a certain energy state. To

obtain the number of thermionic electrons injected in the system by the dust, we have to

distinguish between positively and negatively charged dust grains. In fact, when the dust

grain is negatively charged, any electron with energy 1/2mev2

r > ψ (ψ being the minumum

energy required to overcome the surface barrier) will be emitted, leading to the following

thermionic current [10]

known as the Richardson-Dushman expression [11]. When the grain is positively charged,

the situation is slightly diﬀerent as the electrons have to overcome the ﬂoating potential as

well as the surface barrier. Thus, the thermionic current can be obtained with the same

integration process that leads to Eq. (1) but with the further constraint that an electron

must also overcome the attractive force exerted by the positively charged dust particle. This

results in the following thermioninc current for a positively charged grain [10]

When thermionic emission is added to the OML framework, the equilibrium ﬂoating poten-

tial is established by balancing the ion and electron currents from the surrounding plasma

with the thermionic current emitted by the dust.

Simulation Method: To study the charging of a thermionically emitting dust particle,

we have developed a PIC code in spherical geometry. The dust particle resides in the

center of the domain and a plasma surrounds it. The algorithm used is the standard PIC

algorithm described in Ref. [12] for spherical geometry. The peculiarities of the problem

under investigation require special boundary conditions. We consider a spherical portion

of the system with the grain at the center and an outer radius R. At the outer boundary

some particles leave the system while others must be injected to represent an inﬁnite plasma

4

medium outside the simulation domain. This approach eﬀectively represents an inﬁnite

plasma and can describe correctly the charging of a dust particle in a inﬁnite reservoir.

The algorithm used to inject the particles is the same widely used in the literature [12].

At the inner boundary, the plasma particles reaching the grain surface are removed from

the simulation and their charge is accumulated to the central dust, aﬀecting its ﬂoating

potential. The same injection method used for the outer boundary can be applied also to

the thermionic emission at the inner boundary, but using the dust temperature and not the

plasma electron temperature to evaluate the distribution function of the emitted electrons.

Care must be put in choosing whether particles enter the system according to Eqs.

(1)

or (2). Equation (2) states that the thermionic current is diminished due to the potential

barrier ∆φ = φ(a) − φ∞, namely due to the global potential distribution around the dust.

On the other hand, in the numerical method an electron is emitted locally and undergoes

the potential barrier during its motion. As a consequence, in the numerical code electrons

must always be emitted according to Eq. (1), in order not to count twice the feedback of

the potential barrier.

We have chosen the parameters of the system according to typical experimental condi-

tions. In particular, we consider a Maxwellian plasma with electron temperature Te = 1

eV, ion temperature Ti = 0.2 eV (Te/Ti = 5) and an outer radius of the system R = 500

µm. Moreover, the plasma far away from the dust grain is Maxwellian at rest, with den-

sity N = 6 · 1015 part/m3. These parameters correspond to the electron Debye length

λDe = 96.0 µm, the ion Debye length λDi = 42.9 µm and the electron plasma frequency
ωpe = 4.37 · 109s−1. The linearized Debye length is λDlin = 39.1 µm. The electron mass

is chosen with its physical value, but the ion mass is only 100 times larger. This unphys-

ical choice is common in the literature and is required to keep the cost of the simulation

manageable.

reach a steady state.

In the simulations, we start from a uniform Maxwellian plasma and let the system relax

self-consistently until the charge on the dust grain and the shielding potential around it

Results: To validate our simulation tool, we consider ﬁrst the charging of a dust particle

in absence of any emission. We consider a dust of radius a = 10 µm. Since a/λDlin ≃ 0.2,

the OML theory should be a good approximation and we expect our code to agree with
theoretical predictions. This is indeed true, the ﬂoating charge averaged over the last 70ω−1

of the simulation is Qd = −1.54 · 10−15 C, while the one predicted by the OML theory is
QOML = −1.64·10−15 C. The relative diﬀerence is deﬁned as |Qd −QOML|/ max(Qd, QOML) =
6%. Hereafter, with ”time average” we will always mean an average over the last 70ω−1

pe of

the simulation. At dynamical equilibrium, the ﬂoating potential is φd = −1.1386 V, in good

agreement with the one given by the OML theory, φOML = −1.1776 V (relative diﬀerence

3%). Furthermore, the potential around the dust particle follows closely the Debye-Huckel

expression with a screening length equal to the linearized Debye length λDlin.

We have also considered the primary charging mechanism for a dust of radius a = 80

µm. Since a/λDlin ≃ 2, we expect the OML theory to be unreliable. In fact, our code gives
Qd = −2.04 · 10−14 C while QOML = −3.19 · 10−14 C with a relative diﬀerence of 36%. On

the other hand, the value of the ﬂoating charge deﬁned by QDe = 4πε0a
φ(a) is
a good estimate of Qd (QDe = −1.92 · 10−14 C). This is a consequence of the fact that when

1 +

(cid:18)

λDe (cid:19)

the dust radius grows, the screening length is determined by the electrons [9]. The proﬁle

of the time average ﬂoating potential follows the Debye-Huckel expression but now with a

screening length equal to the electron Debye length λDe, as predicted in Ref. [9]. The time

average ﬂoating potential obtained by the simulation is φd = −1.2044 V and the relative

diﬀerence with respect to φOML = −1.1776 V is 2%. The value of φd in the present case

is more negative than in the case of a = 10 µm due to the development of an absorption

barrier that diminishes the ion current to the dust. Furthermore, the sheath is wider, of the

order of several linearized Debye lengths. In summary, our code has been able to conﬁrm

all the theoretical predictions from the OML theory regarding non emitting dust particles.

Next, we include thermionic emissions. We consider a dust at Td = 0.1 eV and with

work function W = 2.2 eV (which corresponds to metallic oxides [13]). Clearly, high values

of W diminish the thermionic current and it is easy to check that such parameters lead

to a positively charged grain according to the OML theory. We have performed a number

of simulations varying the dust radius a. Here we focus on the case a = 80 µm to point

out the most relevant aspects of the role of thermionic emission in the charging mechanism.

The dynamical equilibrium is reached in approximately 2 electron plasma periods and the
equilibrium charge is: Qd = 8.51·10−15 C, where the OML theory predicts QOML = 5.17·10−15
C (based on expression (2) and λDlin) or QDe = 3.12 · 10−15 C (based on expression (2)

and λDe). However, when the thermionic eﬀect is taken into account a comparison of the

ﬂoating charge of the simulation and of the OML theory is no longer correct. In fact, the

FIG. 1: Thermionic emission. Floating potential φ(r) at diﬀerent times (left) and time averaged

numerical factor that deﬁnes the ﬂoating charge from the ﬂoating potential depends on the

potential distribution close to the dust which, when thermionic emission is present, is not

well represented by the Debye-Huckel potential (either with λDlin or λDe). Focusing on the

ﬂoating potential, we ﬁnd φd = 0.1016 V while φOML = 0.1911 V. Interestingly, when the

thermionic eﬀect is present, the OML theory does not produce an accurate estimate of the

charging mechanism of large grains (also in cases when, in absence of thermionic emission,

its predictions are acceptable). Moreover, we have checked that, for small objects, the OML

theory is still reliable when electron emission is included.

Figure 1 (left panel) shows the ﬂoating potential at 5 diﬀerent times of the simulation.

A potential well is present. The presence of such well is of considerable interest since it can

lead to attractive forces on another dust particle, even when it has the same charge. On the

right panel of Fig. 1 one can see the time average ﬂoating potential and the potential well

is clearly visible.

Discussion: How can a potential well form around the dust? The explanation comes

from the comparison with the case of absence of thermionic emission.

In the presence of suﬃcient thermionic emission (which is the case considered above) the

dust is positively charged. The resulting electric ﬁeld attracts electrons and repels ions.

As a consequence, the electrons emitted from the dust are slowed down in a region very

close to the dust. The more energetic electrons can escape and contribute to the thermionic

current emitted from the dust but the rest of the thermionic electrons form an electron cloud.

FIG. 2: Time averaged normalized electron and ion densities ρe and ρi for a = 80 µm: primary

charging (left) and thermionic emission (right).

The electron cloud determines an excess of negative charge and leads to an (equilibrium)

potential well. This explanation reveals how the dust surface temperature is critical for the

well formation: the higher the temperature, the greater the number of electrons that are

able to escape the dust attraction.

To support this explanation, Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the time average ion and

electron charge density for the case with only primary charging (left two panels) and with

thermionic emission (right two panels). The densities are normalized with respect to the

unperturbed ion density, ρi,∞. For the primary charging case, the densities are perturbed

roughly to a distance of 4 λDlin from the dust grain; the electron density decreases while the

ion density increases towards the grain. The last result is due to spherical geometry and to

the ion angular momentum [9]. In fact, there are many ions with high angular momentum

that do not strike the dust grain, therefore leading to an increment of ion density in the

sheath with respect to the equilibrium value.

Consider next the case with thermionic eﬀect (right panels). The electron density in-

creases close to the grain both due to thermionic emission and to the attractive potential

on the dust. On the other hand, since the dust grain is positively charged, the ion density

diminishes approaching the dust. It can be noticed that the ion density increases from the

dust grain somewhat up to 4 λDlin, reaches a maximum and decreases to the value at rest.

Clearly, Fig. 2 shows the excess of electrons needed for the formation of the attractive well

observed above.

FIG. 3: Langmuir probe. Floating potential φ(r) at diﬀerent times (left) and time averaged

ﬂoating potential (right), for a dust particle with a = 80 µm. The Debye-Huckel potential with

λDlin (dashed line) is shown for comparison. The potential on the dust is held ﬁxed at φ(a) = 0.115

V and no thermionic electrons are emitted.

We have performed another simulation where we have kept the potential on the dust ﬁxed

at the same potential observed in the simulation described above, in presence of thermionic

emission. In the present case, we impose the dust potential and we are not allowing any

thermionic emission: only the primary charging process of plasma particles is in eﬀect. Note

that this simulation is actually a description of the well known Langmuir probe [14] used in

experimental plasma diagnostics. For this case, Fig. 3 shows the potential distribution at

diﬀerent times (left panel) and the time average ﬂoating potential (right panel). One can

see that the time average potential around the dust (not shown) is a decreasing monotonic

function of radius and vanishes asymptotically. Clearly, this conﬁrms that the excess of

electrons seen in Fig. 2 depends on the thermionic electrons.

Finally, we have found the dust temperature critical for the well formation. Increasing

the dust temperature, produces more thermionic electrons with enough kinetic energy to

escape the attractive electric ﬁeld and decreases the potential well until it disappears.

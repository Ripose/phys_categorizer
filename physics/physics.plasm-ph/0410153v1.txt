Abstract

The properties of low-frequency convective ﬂuctuations and transport are investigated
for the boundary region of magnetized plasmas. We employ a two-dimensional ﬂuid model
for the evolution of the global plasma quantities in a geometry and with parameters relevant
to the scrape-off layer of conﬁned toroidal plasmas. Strongly intermittent plasma transport
is regulated by self-consistently generated sheared poloidal ﬂows and is mediated by bursty
ejection of particles and heat from the bulk plasma in the form of blobs. Coarse grained
probe signals reveal a highly skewed and ﬂat distribution on short time scales, but tends
towards a normal distribution at large time scales. Conditionally averaged signals are in
perfect agreement with experimental measurements.

It is well established that the cross ﬁeld transport of particles and heat near the edge of
magnetically conﬁned plasmas is strongly intermittent. This is observed in a variety of devices
including linear [1, 2] as well as toroidal conﬁgurations [3, 4]. Detailed investigations of the spa-
tial ﬂuctuation structure have revealed strong indications that the intermittent nature of particle
and heat transport is caused by localized structures in the form of plasma “blobs” propagating
radially far into the scrape-off-layer (SOL) of toroidal plasmas [2, 5, 6]. It was suggested that
this is caused by a dipolar vorticity ﬁeld formed by the charge separation in a density blob due
to guiding-center drifts in a curved inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld [7].

In this contribution we will provide a self-consistent description of the intermittent particle
and heat ﬂux and link it to the of the emergence and evolution of such blob-like structures. We
base our investigations on a novel model for interchange turbulence in slab geometry for the
outboard midplane of a toroidal device [8]. The model includes the self-consistent evolution
of the full proﬁles in the edge/SOL. A local Boussinesq-like model, where the “background”
proﬁle is separated from the ﬂuctuations, fails to provide a realistic description. The geometry
comprises distinct production and loss regions, corresponding to the edge and SOL of magne-
tized plasmas. The separation of these two regions deﬁnes an effective last closed ﬂux surface
(LCFS), though we do not include magnetic shear in our model. In the edge region, strong pres-
sure gradients maintain a state of turbulent convection. A self-regulation mechanism involving
differential rotation leads to a repetitive expulsion of hot plasma into the SOL, resulting in a
strongly intermittent transport of density and heat.

The model derives from the continuity equations for the electrons, the electron temperature
and the quasi-neutrality condition. Assuming cold ions and neglecting electron inertia effects,
we obtain a three-ﬁeld model for electrostatic perturbations of the full particle density n, electric
potential f and electron temperature T . Using slab coordinates with

Note that Fp is directly proportional to the domain integrated convective thermal energy transport,
while Fv shows that structures tilted such as to transport positive poloidal momentum up the

In the following we present results from numerical simulations of the interchange model
using parameters relevant for SOL plasmas. Lx = 2Ly = 200 and the LCFS is located at xLCFS =
50. The parameters are e = 0.25, z = 5 × 10−4, and n = 10−2 for all ﬁelds. The parallel loss
rate of temperature is assumed to be ﬁve times larger than that on the density and vorticity,
s n = s
W = s T /5 = 3z /2p q, since primarily hot electrons are lost through the end sheaths. s n
W correspond to losses at the nearest target plate over a distance of Lk = 2p R0q/3 (one third
and s
of the connection length) with the acoustic speed cs, where q = 3 is the safety factor at the edge.
Finally, the radial line-integral of the sources Sn and ST equals 0.1. For the numerical solution
the spatial resolution is 512 × 256 grid points in the radial and poloidal directions, and the time
span of the simulation is 2 × 106.

We have performed several runs with varying parameters, showing that the qualitative be-
havior is robust, whereas the quantitative results depend on the parameters and particular on the
value of the collisional diffusivities. The general observation is that the turbulent ﬂux is strongly
intermittent: quite periods are interrupted by strong bursts of particle and heat ﬂuxes. This is
correlated with the kinetics in the ﬂuctuations, as is shown in Fig. 2. We observe that the convec-
tive energy and thermal transport appears as bursts during which particles and heat are lost from
the edge into the SOL region. As discussed in Refs. [9, 10, 11], this global dynamics is caused
by a self-regulation mechanism in which kinetic energy is transfered from the ﬂuctuating to the
mean components of the ﬂows, and subsequently damped by collisional dissipation. The thermal
energy ejected in a bursty manner from the edge and into the SOL region, will eventually be lost
by transport along open ﬁeld lines. The characteristics time between the bursts is related to the
viscous diffusion (compare with Fig. 3 in Ref. [8], where the value of n
is 5 × 10−3). We further
veriﬁed that the self-sustained poloidal ﬂow proﬁles are strongly sheared in the edge region, and
have larger amplitudes during the strong ﬂuctuation period.

The statistics of single-point recordings at different radial positions Pi indicated in Fig. 1
agree very well with experimental measurements. In Fig. 3 we present the probability distribution
functions (histogram of counts) (PDF) of the density signals taken from a long-run simulation

containing more than a hundred strong burst events. It is notably that the PDF at the ﬁrst probe
inside the LCFS is close to a Gaussian with skewness 0.12 and ﬂatness factor 2.97, while the PDF
becomes more ﬂat and skewed further into the SOL. This indicates the high probability of large
positive ﬂuctuations corresponding to blobs of excess plasma. The skewness and ﬂatness factors
grow through out the SOL and take values up to 4 and 25, respectively. The PDF’s in the SOL
have similar structure with a pronounced exponential tail towards large values, a characteristic
feature of turbulent convection in the presence of sheared ﬂows [9, 10].

We have also considered the coarse-grained PDF which is obtained by averaging the signal
over time intervals of lengths t and constructing new time records with a time resolution of t :
t+t /2
nt (t) = (1/t )
t−t /2 n(t′) dt′. The coarse grained PDF’s (PDFt ) for the signal at P3 are also plot-
ted in Fig. 3 for increasing values of t . We observe that PDFt approaches a Gaussian distribution
R
when t
is exceeding the averaged time interval between bursts, which is roughly 104. This shows
the absence of self-similarity, which is characteristic for an intermittent signal (see, e.g., [12]).

The conditionally averaged temporal wave forms of the density calculated from the same
signals and the radial velocity ﬁeld vx, using the trigger condition n − ¯n > 4nrms at each individual
point, are presented in Fig. 4. For the density signal an asymmetric wave form with a sharp rise
and a relatively slow decay is clearly seen, as also observed in experimental measurements [2,
5, 6]. The maximum density excursions signiﬁcantly exceed the background level, and decay
as the structures propagate through the SOL. By using a negative amplitude for the conditional
averaging very few realizations results, conﬁrming the presence of blob-like structures. For
the velocity signal we observe that the radial velocity is positive (directed radially outwards)
in the blob. In the edge region it takes weak negative values both before and after the blob.
Also this result agree with experimental observations [5]. We note that the maximum value of vx
decreases on passing the LCFS and then increases to a maximum value of 0.046 at P3, after which
it slowly decays. From two-dimensional animations we clearly observe the radial propagation of

measured at seven different radial positions Pi as shown in Fig. 1. To the right is the coarse
grained probability distribution function taken at probe 3, averaged over the time intervals t
indicated by the labels. With increasing t
the skewness decreases as: 2.6, 1.9, 0.73, 0.16, and

blob-like structures for the density and temperature ﬁelds, while the vorticity displays a dipolar
structure as expected from theory and experiment (cf. Ref. [8]). From such animations and
radial correlations we ﬁnd that the radial propagation velocity of the blob structures corresponds
to around 0.05cs consistent with Fig. 4, but with a large statistical variance in agreement with
experimental measurements [2, 5, 6].

By combining the conditional evolution of n and vx in Fig. 4 we deduce that the blobs are
carrying a large particle ﬂux. We have examined the PDF of the particle ﬂux averaged over the
periodic y-direction (the ﬂux surface) at different radial positions. The PDF’s are quite similar
and strongly skewed with a ﬂat exponential tail towards positive ﬂux events, showing that the
ﬂux is dominated by strong bursts. The tail of the PDF was found to be well ﬁtted by an extreme
value distribution [13]. By coarse graining the PDF as described above we observe a similar
behavior as for the local density ﬂuctuations: the distribution approaches a Gaussian for large
time scales.

We have demonstrated that a two-dimensional model for interchange turbulence provide re-
sults in good agreement with that reported from experimental investigations of SOL turbulence
and transient transport events [2, 5, 6]. An important feature of the model is the spatial separation
between forcing and damping regions. Our results are in quantitative agreement with experimen-
tal measurements of ﬁeld-aligned blob-like structures propagating far into the scrape-off layer.
The associated intermittent transport may have severe consequences for magnetic conﬁnement
experiments by producing large heat bursts on plasma facing components.

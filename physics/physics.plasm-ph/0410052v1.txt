In this paper we use a hydrodynamic minimal streamer model to study negative corona discharge.
By reformulating the model in terms of a quantity called shielding factor, we deduce laws for the
evolution in time of both the radius and the intensity of ionization fronts. We also compute the
evolution of the front thickness under the conditions for which it diﬀuses due to the geometry of the
problem and show its self-similar character.

A common feature in transient discharges preceding
dielectric breakdown is the creation of a non-equilibrium
plasma through the propagation of a nonlinear ioniza-
tion wave into a previously non-ionized region. Modern
concepts of pattern formation which have been already
applied in diﬀerent contexts (see e.g [1] and [2]), have
also been used in order to gain new analytical insight in
this old problem [3].

When a suﬃciently high voltage is suddenly applied
to a medium with low or vanishing conductivity, extend-
ing ﬁngers of ionized matter develop. They are called
streamers and are ubiquitous in nature and technology
[4, 5]. A minimal streamer model, consisting of a ﬂuid ap-
proximation with local ﬁeld-dependent impact ionization
reaction in a non-attaching gas like argon or nitrogen,
has been used to study the basics of streamer dynamics
[3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The essential properties of planar fronts
for this minimal model have been obtained as a ﬁrst step
towards an eﬀective interface description. For the pla-
nar fronts, the mechanism of dynamical front selection
has been understood and explained [11, 12]. The dis-
persion relation for transversal Fourier-modes of planar
negative ionization fronts has been derived [9] in an at-
tempt to study how the electric screening layer inﬂuences
their stability.

As a further step, we consider in this paper the evo-
lution of negative ionization fronts in a gas under the
inﬂuence of a non-uniform external electric ﬁeld. The
ﬁeld is created by a potential diﬀerence V0 applied be-
tween an electrodes pair. The geometry of the electrodes
determines the non-uniformity of the electric ﬁeld. Dis-
charge develops in the high ﬁeld region near the sharper
electrode and it spreads out towards the other electrode.
This type of discharges is called corona. It is a negative
corona discharge when the electrode with the strongest
curvature is connected to the negative terminal of the
power supply. We will consider this case.

The so-called minimum model consists in the follow-
ing dimensionless set of equations (for physical param-
eters and dimensional analysis, we refer to the previous

discussions in [3, 8, 9, 10]):

∂ne
∂t

− ∇ · j = nef (E),

∂ni
∂t

= nef (E),

∇ · E = ni − ne.

(1)

(2)

(3)

The equation (1) describes the rate of change of the local
dimensionless electron density ne. It is equal to the diver-
gence of the local electron current density j plus a source
term nef (E) representing the generation of electron-ion
pairs due to the impact of accelerated electrons onto neu-
tral molecules of gas. The value of f (E) is given by the
Townsend approximation

f (E) = E exp (−1/E),

(4)

where E is the modulus of the local electric ﬁeld E. In
equation (2) we consider that the rate of change of the
ion density ni is equal to the source term due to impact,
since we take the ion current density to be negligible in a
ﬁrst approximation (the speed of ions is typically much
smaller than that of electrons). The local value of the
electron current density is speciﬁed as

j = neE + D∇ne,

(5)

using Ohm’s law in the ﬁrst term and considering diﬀu-
sion eﬀects in the second one. Note that this expression
does not include the eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld created
by the motion of electrons, as it is supposed that their
speed is much smaller than the speed of light. Equation
(3) is Gauss’ law in local form, coupling the electric ﬁeld
to the charge densities.

Since our primary goal in this paper is to address the
eﬀects of curvature in front propagation, we will neglect
diﬀusion eﬀects as in [9]. That allows us to reduce the
set of equations (1)-(3) into a simpler form in order to
give analytical results for the evolution of the ionization
fronts. From (1), (2), and (5) with D = 0, we obtain

∂
∂t

(ni − ne) + ∇ · (neE) = 0,

and from (3), taking the time derivative,

∇ ·

Equations (6) and (7) give then

(cid:18)

+ neE

= 0.

(cid:19)

where E0 is the modulus of E0 and ni0 is the initial ion
density. Boundary conditions should be imposed depend-
ing on the particular physical situation.

In what follows we will consider a typical corona ge-
ometry: two spherical plates with internal radius R0 and
R1 >> R0, respectively. An electric potential diﬀerence
V0 is applied to these plates, so that V (R1) − V (R0) =
V0 > 0. The initial seed of ionization is taken to be
neutral so that

The term inside brackets in (8) is, due to Maxwell equa-
tions, proportional to the curl of the magnetic ﬁeld in the
gas. As it is supposed that the magnetic ﬁeld is negli-
gible, we can take it equal to zero and integrate in time
yielding

which gives the local electric ﬁeld E in terms of the initial
electric ﬁeld E0 and the electron density ne integrated
in time. Equation (9) motivates the deﬁnition of the
quantity

If this quantity is completely determined in a particular
problem, then using equations (9), (10) and (3) all the
physical ﬁelds can be obtained through the expressions

(13)

in which the initial condition E0 for the electric ﬁeld
should be known. Equation (11) reveals clearly the role
played by the function u(r, t) as a factor modulating the
electric ﬁeld E at any time. The electronic density is
positive so u(r, t) decays damping the electric ﬁeld. For
this reason we call it the shielding factor. The shielding
factor determines a screening length which changes with
time: a kind of Debye’s length which moves with the
front leaving behind a neutral plasma.

The problem is thus reduced to ﬁnding equations and
conditions for the shielding factor u(r, t) from equations
and conditions for the physical quantities E, ne and ni.
Substituting (11)-(13) into the model equations (1)-(3),
after some algebraic manipulations and integrating once
in time, the evolution of u(r, t) is given by

ne0(r) = ni0(r) = ρ0(r).

(16)

We consider the evolution of negative ionization fronts
towards the positive plate at r = R1. The initial electric
ﬁeld E0(r) between the plates is

The equation (19) governing the behaviour of the screen-
ing factor is a Burgers’ type equation, where ρ0(x) is the
initial distribution of charge. The condition for the ini-
tial value of the screening factor is, by (15), u(x, 0) = 1.
Following the usual procedure of resolution of Burgers’
equation we can integrate equation (19) along the char-
acteristics xc(t) deﬁned by

dxc(t)
dt

= u(xc(t), t),

(20)

transforming (19) into an ordinary diﬀerential equation.
First the case of suﬃciently localized initial conditions
is considered. More speciﬁcally, the initial electron den-
sity strictly vanishes beyond a certain point. Under simi-
lar conditions, the existence of shock fronts with constant
velocity has been predicted for the simpler planar geom-
etry [3].

Taking a homogeneous thin layer of width δ << (R1 −
R0) from r = R0 to r = R0 + δ, the initial charge distri-
bution is then

ne0(r) = ni0(r) = ρ0, R0 < r < R0 + δ,
ne0(r) = ni0(r) = 0, R0 + δ < r < R1.

decaying amplitude, separating the region with charge
and the region without charge.

From these numerical data, we can measure the veloc-
ity of propagation of such front. In ﬁgure 2, it is plotted
the position of the shock rf as a function of time. The
velocity of propagation is clearly not constant. However,
if we plot the position of the front in terms of x, one can
observe the following linear relation (see inset ﬁgure 2)

which implies,

in terms of the original variable r, an

xf (t) = t + x0,

rf (t) ∼ (3C)1/3 t1/3

(22)

(23)

for the position of the front.

Remarkably we can deduce expressions for both the
amplitude and propagation velocity of the shock in ex-
plicit analytical form. In order to do that, we write lo-
cally near the front the solution as

u(x, t) = 1 − a(t)ϕ(ξ). ξ = x − xf (t)

(24)

We substitute this ansatz into (19) and since the integral
term is small when x >> 1 we get

where β is an arbitrary constant to be ﬁxed from initial
conditions. Equation (26) proves that the position of the
shock front follows the law (23) for spherical geometry.

From (12), the electron density reads

which implies that the amplitude of the front decays as

ne(xf (t), t) =

.

(30)

In ﬁgure 1 the analytical curve (30) has been plotted
in dashed line, showing an excellent agreement with the
numerical data.

We want to conclude this paper with a brief discussion
of the case in which the initial charge distribution is not
localized as, for instance, one such that

ne0(x) = ni0(x) = ρ0(x) ∼ e

−λx , x >> 1.

(31)

For the planar case it was predicted [3] a constant velocity
for the propagation of the front, although no shock front
would develop unless the decay is suﬃciently fast.

As we did above, we solve the problem numerically
assuming spherical symmetry, so x is related to the ra-
dial coordinate r by (18).
In ﬁgure 3 the solution for
the electron distribution is shown. The shock front does
not appear in this case. Instead, a front with increasing
thickness propagates. In the scaled variable x, we have
checked that the centre of this front moves with constant
velocity as the shock front does. These facts are apparent
from the ﬁgure.

localized, plotted at regular intervals of time.

FIG. 4: Front proﬁles rescaled according to the self-similar
law given by expression (32). The proﬁles converge asymp-
totically to function f in that expression.

Using scaling arguments, it can be shown that the
asymptotic local behaviour near the front can be de-
scribed in the following self-similar form:

ne(x, t) ≈

(cid:18)

(32)

where ξ = x − t, f is some universal self-similar pro-
ﬁle and δλ is a constant measuring the front thickness in
rescaled units. Its value depends on the physical param-
eters and initial conditions. Hence the front presents a
typical thickness

ξc ≈ δλt.

(33)

The fact that, even neglecting diﬀusion, the front spreads
out linearly in time is a remarkable feature of the curved
geometry considered here. For this reason it can be
termed as geometrical diﬀusion. In ﬁgure 4 we have plot-
ted the numerical solutions rescaled according to (32)
showing a clear convergence towards a universal proﬁle.
The principal results and contributions from the work
presented in this paper can be summarised as follows.
First we have introduced the shielding factor as the fac-
tor damping the electric ﬁeld in non-equilibrium elec-
tric discharges when the magnetic ﬁeld can be consid-
ered negligible (10). This factor deﬁnes a characteristic
length analogous to Debye’s length for stationary dis-
charges. The physics contained in the minimum model
for streamer discharges can be reduced to the study of
the evolution of the shielding factor. We have derived the
equation which governs its evolution (14) for a gas like ni-
trogen or argon without taking into account the diﬀusion
of charged species and the processes of photoionization.
Then we have consider the case of a negative corona
discharge with spherical symmetry. In this case, the dis-
charge takes place in a non-homogeneous electric ﬁeld

and the equation for the shielding factor turns out to be
a Burgers’ one. We have extended the results of planar
fronts to this case where the geometry is curved. Depend-
ing on initial conditions for the charge distribution, one
might have negative shocks or spreading fronts. In both
cases, the amplitude decreases in time and the propaga-
tion velocity follows a power law. In the case of spreading
fronts we have proved the appearance of diﬀusion-type
phenomena due to purely geometrical eﬀects.

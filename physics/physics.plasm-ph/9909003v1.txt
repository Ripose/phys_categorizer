Abstract

Reconnection rate is found for the canonical simplest case of steady-
state two-dimensional symmetric reconnection in an incompressible plasma
by matching of outer Petschek solution and internal diﬀusion region solution.
The reconnection rate obtained naturally incorporates both Sweet–Parker
and Petschek regimes, the latter seems to be possible only for the case with
strongly localized resistivity.

I. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic reconnection is an energy conversion process which occurs in astro-
physical, solar, space and laboratory plasmas (e.g., Hones1; Priest2). First attempts
to explain the fast energy release in solar ﬂares based on pure resistive magnetic ﬁeld
dissipation (Sweet3; Parker4) showed that the energy conversion rate is estimated
as 1/√Rem, where

Rem =

VAL
η

(1)

is the global Reynolds number, L is the half-length of reconnection layer, VA is
Alfv´enic velocity, and η is resistivity. For typical conditions in the solar corona the
Sweet-Parker rate turns out to be orders of magnitudes too small when compared
to experimental data.

In 1964 Petschek5 pointed out that in a highly–conducting plasma dissipation
needs only to be present within a small region known as the diﬀusion region, and
energy conversion occurs primarily across non–linear waves, or shocks. This gives
another estimation of the maximum reconnection rate 1/lnRem which is much more
favorable for energy conversion.

Unfortunately, up to the present it is still unclear which conditions make
Petschek-type reconnection to be possible and which are responsible for the Sweet-
Parker regime. The fact is that numerical simulations (Biskamp,1986, Scholer, 1989)
were not able to reproduce solution of Petschek type but rather were in favor of
Sweet-Parker solution unless the resistivity was localized in a small region (e.g., Sc-
holer 1989, Yan, Lee and Priest, 1992, Ugai, 1999). The laboratory experiments also
seem to observe Sweet-Parker regime of reconnection (Uzdensky et al., 1996, Ji et
al.,1999).

From the mathematical point of view the problem of reconnection rate is con-
nected with the matching of a solution for the diﬀusion region where dissipation is
important, and solution for the convective zone where ideal MHD equations can be
used. But up to now this question is still not resolved even for the canonical simplest
case of steady-state two-dimensional symmetric reconnection in an incompressible
plasma.

It is the aim of this paper to present a matching procedure for the canonical
reconnection problem. The reconnection rate obtained from the matching turns out
to incorporate naturally both Petschek and Sweet-Parker regimes as limiting cases.

Petschek solution
We consider the simplest theoretical system consisting of a two–dimensional
current sheet which separates two uniform and identical plasmas with oppositely
B0. Petschek (1964) pointed out that the diﬀusion region
oriented magnetic ﬁelds
can be considerably smaller than the whole size of the reconnection layer and that

±

the outer region contain two pairs of standing slow shocks. These shocks deﬂect
and accelerate the incoming plasma from the inﬂow region into two exit jets wedged
between the shocks (see Figure 1). This jet area between the shocks with accelerated
plasma is traditionally called outﬂow region.

In the dimensionless form the Petschek solution can be presented as follows

(Petschek, 1964, for details see Vasyliunas, 1975):

Outﬂow region:

Equation of shock in the ﬁrst quadrant is the following:

vx = 1; vy = 0; Bx = 0; By = ε.

y = εx.

Here x, y are directed along the current sheet and in the perpendicular direction,
respectively. We normalized the magnetic ﬁeld to B0, length to L, plasma velocity
to Alfv´enic velocity VA, and electric ﬁeld E to Alfv´enic electric ﬁeld EA = VAB0.

The reconnection rate

ε = E/EA << 1

is supposed to be a small parameter of the problem.

and the Rankine-Hugoniot shock relations in the limit Rem → ∞
. Petschek did not
obtain a solution in the diﬀusion region, instead he estimated maximum reconnection
rate as 1/lnRem of using some simple physical suggestion . Generally speaking, this
implies that the Petschek model gives any reconnection rate from Sweet-Parker value
1/√Rem up to 1/lnRem, and it is still unclear whether Petschek reconnection faster
than Sweet-Parker reconnection is possible. The problem can be solved by matching
of a solution for the diﬀusion region and Petschek solution (2-5).

Diﬀusion region scaling
We renormalize the MHD equations to the new scales B′

A, where
all quantities are supposed to be taken at the diﬀusion region upper boundary, and

A = B′

at the half length of the diﬀusion region ld. We have to use the dissipative MHD
equations (7–9) for the diﬀusion region with Reynolds number

and electric ﬁeld E = ε′.

(see Landau and Lifshitz, 1985):

The scaling for the diﬀusion region is similar to that for the Prandtl viscous layer

where ˜η(˜x, ˜y) is the normalized resistivity of the plasma with maximum value 1.

Unfortunately, the appropriate exact solutions of the boundary layer equations
(13–16) are unknown, therefore we have to solve the problem numerically. The main
diﬃculty is that the internal reconnection rate ˜ε is unknown in advance and has
to be determined for given resistivity ˜η(˜x, ˜y), given total pressure ˜P (˜x), and ˜Bx(˜x)
given at the upper boundary of the diﬀusion region. In addition, the solution must
have Petschek-type asymptotic behaviour (2–5) outside of the diﬀusion region.

Although we are looking for a steady-state solution, from the simulation point of
view it is advantageous to use relaxation method and solve numerically the following
unstationary system of boundary layer MHD equations:

Starting with an initial MHD conﬁguration under ﬁxed boundary conditions we look
for convergence of the time-dependent solutions to a steady state.

As initial conﬁguration we choose a X-type ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld: ˜vx = ˜x, ˜vy =
˜x. The distribution of the resistivity is traditional (see

˜Bx = ˜y,

˜By =

˜y,

−
−
(Ugai,1999, Scholer 1985)):

η(˜x, ˜y) = de(−sx ˜x2−sy ˜y2) + f,

(20)

with d + f = 1 where coeﬃcient d describes inhomogeneous resistivity, and f is
responsible for the background resistivity.

The problem under consideration consists essentially of two coupled physical
processes: diﬀusion and wave propagation. To model these processes, two-step with
respect to time numerical scheme has been used. At ﬁrst, convectional terms were
calculated using the Godunov characteristic method, and then the elliptical part
was treated implicitly.

Calculations were carried out on a rectangular uniform grid 100

145 in the ﬁrst

quadrant with the following boundary conditions:
Lower boundary: symmetry conditions ∂˜vx/∂y = 0,
equation (18) has been used to compute the By component at the x–axis.
Left boundary: symmetry conditions ˜vx = 0, ∂˜vy/∂x = 0, ∂ ˜Bx/∂x = 0,
Right boundary: free conditions ∂˜vx/∂x = 0, ∂˜vy/∂x = 0.
Upper (inﬂow) boundary: ˜vx = 0,

˜Bx = 1.

×

˜vy = 0, Bx = 0; induction

˜By = 0.

Note, that this implies that we do not prescribe the incoming velocity, and hence
the reconnection rate: the system itself has to determine how fast it wants to recon-
nect.

The total pressure can be ﬁxed to 1 in the zero-order approximation: ˜P = 1.
Let us discuss the result of our simulations. For the case of localized resistivity
sx = sy = 1 in the equation (20), the
where we chose d = 0.95,
system reaches Petschek steady state (see Figure 2) with clear asymptotic behaviour,
pronounced slow shock, and the reconnection rate turns out to be ˜ε

f = 0.05,

0.7.

From the other hand, for the case of homogeneous resistivity d = 0, f = 1, the
system reaches Sweet-Parker state (see Figure 3) with much less reconnection rate
˜ε
.25 even if the Petschek solution has been used as initial conﬁguration (see also
(Ugai, 1999, Scholer,1989)). This seems to imply that Petschek-type reconnection is
possible only if the resistivity of the plasma is localized in a small region, and for
constant resistivity the Sweet-Parker regime is realized.

The size of the diﬀusion region ld can be deﬁned as the size of the region where
B (which is zero at the origin) reaches the
the convective electric ﬁeld E = v
asymptotic value ˜ε (or, some level, say 0.95˜ε). For the case of localized resistivity
ld practically coincides with the scale of the inhomogeneity of the conductivity. In
principal, there might be a possibility to produce Petschek-type reconnection with
constant resistivity using a highly inhomogeneous behaviour of the MHD parameters

at the upper boundary (narrow stream, for example, see Chen et al.,1999), and then
ld has the meaning of the scale of this shearing ﬂow or other boundary factor which
causes the reconnection.

Matching procedure
We have only a numerical solution for the diﬀusion region, and this makes it dif-
ﬁcult for the matching procedure because the latter needs an analytical presentation
of the solutions to be matched. The only way out left is to continue the diﬀusion
region solution to the inﬂow region using dates known from the simulation distribu-
tion of the By component along the upper boundary of the diﬀusion region. Then
try to match the solutions in the current free inﬂow region at the distance r
ld
(see Figure 1).

∼

As can be seen from equation (3) the Bx component of the Petschek solution
diverges at the origin Bx → −∞
0. This singularity is a
consequence of the fact that dissipation actually has not been taken into account for
the solution (2- 5) which is nevertheless still valid untill the distances of the order
of the size of diﬀusion region is ld.

Now everything is ready to determine the reconnection rate. The electric ﬁeld must
be constant in the whole inﬂow region, hence

We were not able to reproduce Petschek regime using variation of MHD parame-
ters at the upper boundary with homogeneous resistivity, a probably solution (Chen,
1999) of this problem either is essentially time-dependent or corresponds to the case
of strong reconnection. According to our simulations, for Petschek state to exist a
strongly localized resistivity is needed, and for the spatially homogeneous resistivity
ld = L Sweet–Parker regime seems to be always the case. This result resolves old

7

question about conditions which are necessary for Petschek-type reconnection to
appear.

It is interesting that for the deriving of equations (28,29) the only value which has
been actually used is the internal reconnection rate ˜ε obtained from the numerical
solution, but the distribution of the By component along the upper boundary of the
diﬀusion region does not contribute at all (besides asymptotic behaviour (22)) in the
zero–order approximation considered above. Of course, from the mathematical point
of view it is important that diﬀusion region solution exists and has Petschek–like
asymptotic behaviour (2–4).

The strongly localized resistivity is often the relevant case in space plasma ap-
plications, but for the laboratory experiments where the size of a device is relatively
small the Sweet–Parker regime is expected.

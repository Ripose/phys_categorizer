Abstract

A theoretical study of the improvement of the Electron Cyclotron Current Drive (ECCD) eﬃ-

ciency in regimes where most of the current is driven by Lower Hybrid (LH) waves is presented. A

perturbation technique is employed to solve the adjoint equation and derive the response function

including both collisional and LH eﬀects in the limit where the former dominate. An alternative

treatment of the problem, involving a numerical solution of the Langevin equations is proposed

to gain insight into the current drive mechanism and conﬁrm the obtained results. The existence

of a cross-eﬀect between the two waves is demonstrated and the conditions for the synergy, i.e.

signiﬁcant enhancement of the ECCD eﬃciency in the presence of LH power, are identiﬁed.

INTRODUCTION

Among the desirable features of a future tokamak-based fusion reactor is its steady-state

operation, which implies that the toroidal current has to be totally sustained by non induc-

tive sources[1]. Moreover, for ongoing as well as for future experiments, a sharp tailoring of

the current proﬁles is known to have a favorable eﬀect on the plasma conﬁnement. These

prerequisites are key elements of the advanced tokamak concept, which relies on the fact

that a large fraction of the plasma current is supplied by the bootstrap current, generally

triggered and supplemented by injecting neutral beams of radio-frequency (RF) waves in

the plasma[2].

A wide class of waves can be launched in the plasma yet, for current drive purposes, the

excitation of superthermal electrons has been the most successful method, in accordance

with theoretical predictions[1]. Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) is a well-tested and

eﬃcient method[3, 4, 5], based on Landau damping of the wave power. Its main drawback

is that in the so-called multi-pass regime, the current proﬁle remains diﬃcult to control

and calculations still lack full reliability. Note, however, that in very hot plasmas, the wave

is expected to be absorbed without relying on any subtle upshift mechanism (single-pass

absorption), which makes the LH wave a serious candidate to drive oﬀ-axis current in future

experiments[4]. On the other hand, Electron Cyclotron (EC) waves exploit the resonance

with the electron gyro-motion and are characterized by a narrow deposition, thus providing

a means to induce a local modiﬁcation of the current proﬁle. The eﬃciency, however, is

known to be signiﬁcantly lower than for LH waves[6].

Owing to these complementary features, combined schemes, in which LH and EC waves

are used together, constitute an appealing solution for advanced tokamak discharges.

In

particular, both waves are expected to exert a cross-eﬀect on superthermal electrons, often

and sometimes improperly referred to as the LH-EC synergy eﬀect. The consequences of this

cross-eﬀect encompass the possibility to modify the LH superthermal tail, a better absorp-

tion of EC waves and an improvement of the ECCD eﬃciency which may help in controlling

the current proﬁle[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Self-consistent, dynamical calculations including waves

kinetic and heat transport eﬀects have stressed the advantages of such scenarios but owing

to the non-linear nature of these simulations, the various eﬀects are diﬃcult to separate[12].

Experimentally, a cross-eﬀect has been observed under certain conditions but the interpreta-

2

tion of these measurements are diﬃcult and have led to contradictory conclusions, due either

to their transient character or to very large fast particle losses[13, 14, 15, 16]. More recently,

a hard X-ray camera[17] has been employed to analyze the emission of fast electrons in the

presence of LH and EC waves during the current ﬂat-top phase on the Tore Supra[18] and

FTU[19] tokamaks. In both experiments, a response of the high energy channels was ob-

served, compatible with the existence of a cross-eﬀect, but due to the relatively low applied

EC power, no conclusive observation could be made in terms of ECCD eﬃciency.

Despite these numerical and experimental results, and owing to the lack of a simple

mechanism to explain the cross-eﬀect of both waves on fast electrons, this subject is still

being debated. The goal of this paper is thus to study the combined current drive process

from a theoretical standpoint and identify the conditions for the existence of a LH-EC

synergy. To this aim, the adjoint method, originally proposed by Antonsen and Chu[20] and

generalized to the RF current drive problem by Fisch[1], is extended to a situation in which

two waves are simultaneously present in the plasma. Another possible method is to solve the

Langevin equations, which track individual electron relaxation paths and deduce quantities

of interest for the current drive problem by average over statistical realizations[21]. These

two complementary methods are employed to derive the response function, which leads to an

estimate of the current drive eﬃciency, including the cross-eﬀect and therefore the LH-EC

synergy.

This article is organized as follows. After the presentation of the kinetic aspect of the

problem in section II, the adjoint method is employed to compute an approximate expression

of the response function for a LHCD plasma in section III. Section IV is devoted to the

study of the dynamics underlying the RF current drive process, through the derivation of

the associated Langevin equations. The properties of the response function obtained from

these two methods are examined in section V. The practical consequences of the presence

of LH waves on the EC Current Drive are discussed in section VI, where the synergy eﬀect

is demonstrated. Conclusions are drawn is section VII.

collisions, LH and EC waves, the kinetic equation can be written as

For the problem under discussion here, a useful form for the distribution function is

modiﬁed by application of the LH power, solution of

ˆC(fmφ) = ˆDlhfm(1 + φ)

Upon subtracting (7) from (1), we obtain the equation for fmδφ, which writes

In this expression, the right term describes the electron excitation caused by the elec-

combined eﬀect of collisions and LH power.

Recalling that fm is even for uk, the normalized current associated to f can be written

Note that up to this point, no approximation other than the fact that Te and ne, the elec-

tron temperature and density, are non-varying on the time-scale of the studied problem has

been introduced. To evaluate the driven current, it is usual to resort to a Fokker-Planck code

and compute the distribution function solution of Eq. 1. In this work, however, an analytical

approach of the problem has been preferred. Even though it implies certain assumptions,

the linearization it is based on has the advantage of allowing a separate treatment of the

two waves, which is impracticable in purely numerical calculations. This separation is the

key to demonstrating unambiguously the possibility of a synergy eﬀect.

To compute j0 (Eq. 11), it is necessary to solve Eq. 7. Following Eq. 4, the expression

1. A drive, whose features are contained in the expressions for the quasilinear ﬂuxes Slh

and Sec.

2. A relaxation, which is described by the response functions χ0 and χ1.

The quasilinear ﬂuxes contain the information on the distribution function and their

evaluation is a delicate task, generally involving a kinetic code. However, if one is merely

interested in an estimation of the current drive eﬃciency, as long as the interaction is well

localized in velocity space, the information on the direction of these ﬂuxes is known to be

suﬃcient[1]. Note that this relaxes the assumption employed to derive Eq. 13 since as a

result, only the direction of Slh has to be unchanged by EC waves for the LH eﬃciency

calculation to remain valid.

The problem now reduces to evaluating the response function and in order to achieve

this, two methods are available: the adjoint formalism and the Langevin equations. Both

will be discussed for the case of two waves in the next sections.

III. ADJOINT METHOD IN THE PRESENCE OF TWO WAVES

In this section, the adjoint formalism is extended to the case of two waves, when no

static electric ﬁeld is present, which is relevant for a number of experiments. For the sake

of concision, only the signiﬁcant steps of this method, extensively discussed in Ref. 1 and

references therein, will be recalled.

The adjoint equation is obtained by comparing Eqs. 23 and 11 and making use of the

property fm ˆC †ψ = ˆC(fmψ). It writes

This equation simply describes the response of a collisional plasma and associated with

Eq. 2, it leads to the well-known Fisch-Boozer response function

In order to compute j1, a similar treatment is applied to Eq. 9, introducing the associated

response function χ1(u). By noting that the LH quasilinear diﬀusion coeﬃcient is self-
adjoint, i.e. ˆD†

lh = ˆDlh, the adjoint equation takes the form

This equation describes χ1, response function of a plasma in which the LH wave modiﬁes

the distribution function, modifying in turn the electron relaxation properties. Physically, it

means that these electrons describe a collisional curve in velocity space, carrying elemental
current uk + ˆD†

lhχ1 instead of uk. A rigorously equivalent interpretation is that the particles

carry uk as elemental current but describe relaxation curves inﬂuenced by the wave.

Under this form, the adjoint equation (26) does not appear to have an analytical solution.

A further assumption is to consider that collisions dominate the relaxation process. In other

words, in spite of the modiﬁcation of the dynamics in the parallel direction caused by the

LH wave, the relaxation curves remain mostly collisional. This approximation allows one to
linearize χ1, letting χ1 ≡

IV. LANGEVIN EQUATIONS

To track the electrons trajectories on their relaxation paths, a natural and convenient

method consists in solving the Langevin equations[1, 24, 25]. Besides providing a clear

insight in the dynamics underlying the relaxation process[26], they can be used to compute

the response function χ. Another advantage is that no speciﬁc approximation regarding the

respective intensities of the collisions and of the wave has to be introduced. They can thus

be used to validate the results obtained with the adjoint method (see section III).

In this section, the discussion will focus on the evaluation of χ1 but it can be easily

transposed to χ0 since the latter is a particular case of the former (with Dlh,0 = 0).

The Green function g1 corresponding to Eq. 9 has been introduced in section II. Physi-
cally, g1(u, u′, τ )du is the probability of ﬁnding an electron initially at velocity space position

9

u′ within element du at location u after a time τ . It means that the associated steady-state

response function χ1(u), whose deﬁnition is given by Eq. 18, can be evaluated by computing

the elemental current carried by each electron of a set whose initial location is u along its

relaxation trajectory, as it undergoes the eﬀects of Coulomb collisions and LH wave power,

and perform an ensemble average afterwards. Rather than directly solving Eq. 17, it is thus

possible to resort to a stochastic description of this relaxation process. It can be done by

casting this equation into the form

To compute the drift caused by the wave, it is necessary to bear in mind that when the

transformation from one coordinate system to another is not linear, as is the case when

the LH quasilinear diﬀusion coeﬃcient is transformed from (u⊥, uk) to (u, µ) coordinates,

the friction term needs to include a contribution from the diﬀusion in the ﬁrst coordinate

system[21]. This yields

Practically, in the simulations presented in this paper, the collision time is split in numer-

ous timesteps and each electron velocity evolves according to Eq. 42 until thermalization is

attained. It should be emphasized that the integration of a stochastic equation in the case

of a multiplicative noise has to be carried out with care to avoid numerical artifacts liable

to distort the result. A detailed discussion of this question can be found in Ref. 26. Here,

both Euler and Heun methods have been implemented and the results have been found to

be generally indistinguishable. It is recognized that two main sources of numerical error can

alter the solution of stochastic equations[27]. Firstly, the statistical error, due to the ﬁnite

number of realizations, which can be evaluated from standard statistical methods. Secondly,

the error induced by the time discretization. To reduce the latter, it is usual to perform

several simulations with diﬀerent timesteps ∆τ , and extrapolate the result for ∆τ

0. For

→

the values of Dlh,0 considered in this section, this error was found to be negligible.

11

To illustrate the combined eﬀects of Coulomb collisions and LH waves on the electron

relaxation, randomly chosen individual relaxation paths can be studied. The velocity-space

conﬁguration of the problem appears on Fig. 1, where three domains (labeled 1-3) are

distinguished, corresponding to (1) u0 < uk,1, (2) u0 > uk,1 and uk0 < uk,2, and (3) uk0 > uk,2.

Such sample trajectories are shown on Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5 which have been produced

with the following parameters: uk,1 = 3, uk,2 = 5, ∆uk,1 = 0.5, ∆uk,2 = 1, Zi = 1 and

Dlh,0 = 0.1. All these ﬁgures are divided in two, the part labelled (a) where only the

collisions are included in the calculation, and (b) where the electrons undergo the combined

eﬀect of collisions and wave power.

On Fig. 2, a trajectory obtained for an electron whose initial velocity lies in region 1 is

shown. In such a case and as long as the energy diﬀusion caused by the collisions is ne-

glected, which is a reasonable approximation, the wave power can not inﬂuence the electron

relaxation, since the particle never reaches the wave diﬀusion domain. The relaxation path

of an electron starting from the LH quasilinear domain (in region 2) can be seen on Fig. 3.

In this case, the supplemental parallel diﬀusion and drift induced by the LH wave clearly

lengthen the path, and will be likely to slow the relaxation process, thus enhancing the car-

ried current. Another possibility is for the initial velocity to belong to region 2, but outside

the LH domain (uk0 < uk,1). A sample trajectory corresponding to this case is shown on

Fig. 4 and interestingly enough, although the particle has an initial parallel velocity such as

uk0 < uk,1, it experiences the wave inﬂuence due to the pitch-angle scattering eﬀect. This is

the reason why u0 appears to be as crucial as uk0. Finally, on Fig. 5, the relaxation of an

electron having uk0 > uk,2 is shown (region 3). Although the wave domain is encountered,

the net eﬀect on the relaxation length is more complicated, as the upper-velocity boundary

of the LH quasilinear coeﬃcient, at least in the model chosen here to describe the wave,
induces a drift towards lower velocities (since ∂dlh/∂uk|uk,2 < 0) which can accelerate the
relaxation with respect to a purely collisional trajectory.

For a quantitative evaluation of the eﬀects of LH waves on the particles thermalization,

a statistical analysis has to be performed. This is done by considering many electrons with

initial velocity u0, tracking the relaxation trajectories until thermalization and performing

When the collisions are the only eﬀect taken into account, it is possible to average the

Langevin equations analytically and deduce the response function[1]. For our purpose,

however, this operation is not possible and the computation of the response function has to

be performed numerically.

Here, we study

positions u0 = (uk0, u⊥0) = (3, 0), (4, 0) and (6, 0), and normalized LH diﬀusion coeﬃcients

Dlh,0 = 0 (collisions only), Dlh,0 = 0.1, Dlh,0 = 0.2, Dlh,0 = 0.4. The collisional Fisch-

Boozer solution, given (for Zi = 1) by

(τ ) = uk0(1

−

superimposed with its numerical counterpart and is thus barely visible.

It can be observed that for (uk0, u⊥0) = (3, 0) or (4, 0), the wave clearly delays the

thermalization.

In the third case (uk0 = 6), the eﬀect of the drift induced at the high-

velocity boundary appears clearly, since the electrons begin by experiencing a faster decrease

in parallel velocity, on average. However, the energy range of the electrons is largely spread

by the wave and a signiﬁcant proportion has not yet thermalized, well after the purely

collisional relaxation is over. The response function is determined by the balance between

these two eﬀects and its features shall be presented in the next section.

V. RESPONSE FUNCTION OF A LHCD PLASMA

In section IV, a numerical method has been presented and employed to perform a ba-

sic analysis of the velocity space structure when the presence of LH power inﬂuences the

dynamics underlying the current drive process. Although it can be used to compute the

response function, the perturbation method presented in section III is more economical in

terms of computational resources and is thus more adapted to a systematic study of the

response function properties, which is the goal of the present section.

In what follows, the same parameters as in section IV are considered for the Lower Hybrid

quasilinear domain. On Fig. 7, some level curves the total response function χ0 + δχ are

represented in (uk, u⊥) space for Dlh,0 = 0.1 (a) and Dlh,0 = 0.2 (b). For comparison, the

13

corresponding contours of the Fisch-Boozer response function χ0 appear as dashed lines.

Several observations can be made about this ﬁgure. Firstly, the overall modiﬁcation of

the response function is rather moderate, which is consistent with the approximation of

the adjoint calculation, which requires the collisions to dominate the electron relaxation.

Secondly, the response function is modiﬁed mainly in the LH quasilinear domain, but not

only and it can be seen to extend to all velocities such as u > uk,1 as well as beyond uk = uk,2,

which is consistent with the conclusions drawn in section IV. This behavior is clearly visible

on Fig. 8, where the response function perturbation δχ is shown as a function of µ for various

values of u, and Dlh,0 = 0.1.

This ﬁgure shows the strong asymmetrical shape of δχ. As a result, the total response

function χ1 is largely enhanced in the uk > 0 region of velocity space, under the inﬂuence

of the LH wave. As predicted for u < uk,1, we obtain δχ = 0, in other words χ1 reduces

to the Fisch-Boozer response function. The pitch-angle scattering eﬀect can cause δχ(u, µ)

to be non-zero even for uk < uk,1 and particularly for uk < 0. Another observation is that

δχ falls oﬀ rapidly for u > uk,2 and can even become negative. This eﬀect is best viewed

when δχ is represented as a function of uk, for various values of u⊥, as shown on Fig. 9. For

completeness, the result from the Langevin equations computation also appears for u⊥ = 0,

the error bars being deduced from the estimated statistical error.

One can notice that for u >
∼

6, δχ is negative, which would indicate a deleterious eﬀect

of the LH wave on the EC-driven current when the latter is carried by electrons excited

in this region. Although supported by the numerical solution of the Langevin equations,

this conclusion must, however, be tempered by several considerations: (i) In this region of

velocity space, δχ is sensitive to the value chosen for ∆uk,2 which is not readily available, (ii)

EC wave absorption at velocities signiﬁcantly above the upper bound of the LH quasilinear

domain is diﬃcult and would most likely be impossible in the absence of LH wave. The

concept of EC current drive improvement or degradation is thus of little sense, (iii) The

Fisch-Boozer response function is proportional to u4, which makes the LH-induced modi-

ﬁcation rather weak for large values of uk. The latter point is supported by the result of

Fig. 10, where χ0 and χ0 + δχ are shown as a function of uk for the same parameters as

Fig. 9.

This ﬁgure shows that beyond the upper boundary of the LH domain, the eﬀect is indeed

small. Physically, this simply means that no EC eﬃciency improvement takes place for

14

uk

uk,2, aside from the fact that the very presence of a LH plateau is responsible for the

>
∼

EC wave absorption at this location[7].

More important than the response function itself, as far as the RF current drive is con-

cerned, is its velocity-space gradient, as is apparent from Eq. 19. For EC waves, the diﬀer-

entiation is to be performed along u⊥. On Fig. 11, the quantity δχ′

∂δχ/∂u⊥ is shown

≡

versus uk for various values of u⊥.

Whenever uk < uk,2, δχ′ appears to be positive, which implies a favorable contribution of

the LH wave to the EC current. Moreover, even for moderate values of u⊥, where electrons

are most easily driven by EC waves, δχ′ can be fairly large, provided an appropriate range of

parallel velocities is selected, which is possible through the use of suitable launching angles[6].

For uk

uk,2, δχ′ can have a negative value, although as stated above, this feature should be

pondered cautiously. This ﬁgure conﬁrms that the LH wave has an overall beneﬁcial eﬀect

>
∼

on the current driven EC wave, and that a synergy between the two waves can be expected,

especially when the latter are excited in the vicinity of uk,ec

uk,2. Note that this parameter

is generally simply determined by the LH wave accessibility condition[28], and is therefore

<
∼

readily available from experimental measurements of the major plasma parameters.

VI. ECCD EFFICIENCY IN THE PRESENCE OF LH WAVES

The features of the distribution function in the presence of LH waves presented in the

previous section have consequences in terms of ECCD eﬃciency. From Eq. 10, the total

current appears as j = j0 + j1 where j0 (Eq. 16) is driven by the LH wave, and is implicitly

assumed to be unaﬀected by the presence of the EC wave, in the present model. In section

III, the response function of the plasma in the presence of LH waves was linearized according

to χ1 = χ0 +δχ, which implies that j1, given by Eq. 19 can be cast into the form j1 = jec +δj,

(47)

with

and

jec is the EC current obtained when the cross-eﬀect of both waves is not accounted for

(48)

δj

and δj is a supplemental current, which qualiﬁes for the denomination synergy current (or

anti-synergy, in the event that δj and jec have opposite signs). This clear distinction stems

jec ≡

from the linearization introduced in the computation of the response function and allows

a straightforward separation of the contribution of each process, which is generally the key

diﬃculty encountered when trying to characterize a synergy eﬀect.

Deﬁning jw the amount of current generated by wave power pw, the steady-state current

drive eﬃciency can be expressed as[1]

Evaluating this expression only requires the direction of Sw, which unlike its magnitude, is

only weakly dependent on the precise shape of the distribution function and is well-known[1]
(Sec ∝

ˆe⊥ and Slh ∝

ˆek).

Here, the eﬃciencies of both waves are computed using Eq. 50 with the same parameters

as in Section III: Dlh,0 = 0.1, uk,1 = 3, uk,2 = 5, ∆uk,1 = 0.5 and ∆uk,2 = 1. On Fig. 12,

these eﬃciencies are shown as functions of uk for Zi = 1, u⊥ = 0 and u⊥ = 2

The 4:3 ratio between the LH and EC eﬃciencies is recovered, in the absence of a cross-

eﬀect[1]. If this eﬀect is included, the corrected EC eﬃciency (i.e. (jec + δj)/pec) is sig-

niﬁcantly enhanced in the region of velocity space corresponding to the LH superthermal

plateau. For the chosen value of Dlh,0, it becomes comparable to the LH eﬃciency. A slight

anti-synergy eﬀect is observed for uk above uk,2 but this point has been extensively addressed

in Section III. The EC eﬃciency enhancement increases with u⊥ and can exceed the LH

eﬃciency on a signiﬁcant range of parallel velocities. Moreover, for some parameters, the

counter-current drive amount can be slightly lowered by the synergy eﬀect, which can fur-

ther enhance the current driven in a EC downshift scheme[6], where the wave interacts with

electrons having uk < 0 as well as uk > 0.

To characterize the ECCD eﬃciency enhancement, following the deﬁnition introduced
(jlh+ec −
in Ref. 12, the improvement factor Fsyn ≡
16

jlh)/jec is studied. According to the

linearization introduced in this model, it simpliﬁes to give

Fsyn = 1 +

= 1 +

δj
jec

∂δχ/∂u⊥
∂χ0/∂u⊥

(51)

The same parameters as above are used, but the ion charge Zi is varied from 1 to 3. The

variation of the synergy factor as a function of uk is shown on Fig. 13.

It is seen that the interaction with electrons whose parallel velocity lies in the vicinity of

the LH quasilinear domain can be very beneﬁcial for the EC current drive. For the chosen

value of Dlh,0, an improvement of the eﬃciency as high as 40% can be obtained. The anti-

synergy eﬀect underlined above proves to be marginal. Another observation is that even

though the plasma ion charge increase is known to be detrimental to superthermal electrons-

based current drive schemes, it has only a minor inﬂuence on the synergy mechanism itself.

Finally, a particularly noticeable feature is that the improvement factor is found to be weakly

dependent on the particular velocity space location under consideration.

Hitherto, the presented simulations have all been performed for Dlh,0 = 0.1, in order to

ensure the validity of the perturbation technique employed to derive the response function

from the adjoint equation. The Langevin equations formalism, introduced in section IV, is

more demanding from a computational point of view. Still, it has the advantage of oﬀering

more ﬂexibility than a Fokker-Planck treatment and allows to study how the EC Current

Drive eﬃciency depends on Dlh,0, since it is derived without any assumption regarding its

particular value.

This study is performed by solving the Langevin equations (Eq. 42) for 20,000 electrons

at each initial velocity. For increasing values of Dlh,0, the timestep ∆τ is decreased so

as to remain small with respect to the variations of

=
Dlh (see Eq. 39) and Flh (Eq. 41).

To ensure convergence, however, the computation is performed with several values of ∆τ ,

and the resulting averaged quantities are extrapolated to ∆τ

0. For large values of

→

Dlh,0, this procedure proves to be necessary to avoid the inherent bias induced by the time

discretization, which adds to the purely statistical error[27].

The same plasma and LH wave parameters as above are chosen, with Zi = 1. The

simulations are performed for velocity space location (uk, u⊥) = (4, 1) and the quantity

under study is δχ

χ0 where χ1 is obtained from the Langevin equations (Eq. 46) and

χ1 −

≡

χ0 is given by Eq. 25. As discussed in section VI, the most relevant quantity, as far as the
ECCD eﬃciency is concerned, is δχ′ = ∂δχ/∂u⊥. To obtain it, simulations are performed

17

for several values of u⊥ and the derivative is obtained numerically.

On Fig. 14, δχ and δχ′ are plotted versus Dlh,0, with associated ﬁtting curves. For

comparison, the adjoint solution for δχ appears also.

The adjoint solution appears to give a fair result for Dlh,0

1, in accordance with the

validity range of the associated method. Its linear dependence on Dlh,0 (see Eq. 33), however,

leads to an overestimate of the response function, as δχ is found to level oﬀ when Dlh,0 is

increased. To extrapolate the results as Dlh,0 tends to inﬁnity, i.e. in a perfectly saturated

<
∼

situation, the following ﬁtting function is employed for δχ′

δχ′ = a0 ·

(1

−

exp(

a1Da2

lh,0))

−

(52)

A least square ﬁt leads to a0 ≈

7.3, a1 ≈

0.7 and a2 ≈

value limDlh,0→∞ δχ′

7.3, or when used in Eq. 51, Fsyn ≈

≈

0.5. This gives the extrapolated

2.8. This means that for the

parameters considered here, the ECCD eﬃciency is nearly tripled when compared to its

“standard” value, i.e. the value obtained in the absence of Lower Hybrid waves.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Owing to the complexity of a full kinetic treatment of the current drive problem in toka-

maks, added to the diﬃculty of separating the contributions from various physical processes,

the existence of a synergy between LH and EC waves has often been disputed. In this pa-

per, a diﬀerent approach has been employed to address this question from a theoretical

standpoint, when the dominant source of deformation of the distribution function is LH

power. Two complementary methods have been employed: a perturbation solution of the

adjoint equation allows a fast derivation of the response function including both collisional

and LH eﬀects in the limit where the former dominate. On the other hand, solving the

Langevin equations allows to overcome this restriction and in addition to the computation

of the response function, provides clear insight in the dynamics underlying the process. How-

ever, they imply a less straightforward mathematical treatment and higher computational

requirements.

By application of these two formalisms, it has been shown that a synergy was indeed

possible between the two waves, provided the EC parameters are chosen to drive electrons

within or close to the LH quasilinear domain. Even for moderate values of the LH quasilinear

18

diﬀusion coeﬃcient, a signiﬁcant improvement of the ECCD eﬃciency has been obtained.

Moreover, for suﬃciently high values of this coeﬃcient, i.e. when quasilinear saturation is

reached, the improvement factor appears to be nearly constant. Also, in this study, the

eﬃciency enhancement has been found to exhibit only a mild dependence on the particular

velocity space location. These trends suggest that the synergy mechanism is fairly robust

and should manifest itself provided the EC waves are launched using a set of parameters

compatible with the LH quasilinear domain properties.

In present experiments, the characterization of such an enhancement of EC current drive

eﬃciency can be a daunting task. This is mostly due to the fact that, as in numerical

simulations, a lot of phenomena are involved in the process and are diﬃcult to separate.

It is nonetheless possible to envision experimental scenarios aimed at studying the LH-EC

synergy. One such scenario could be creating a fully non-inductive plasma by relying on the

LHCD system. After a delay equivalent to several resistive times, injecting two EC beams

with opposite parallel spectra - i.e. opposite toroidal angle, to lowest order - should result

in zero net EC current in the absence of a cross-eﬀect. The measurement of an additional

amount of current would then be the signature of a synergy between the two waves.

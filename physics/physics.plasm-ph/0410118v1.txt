like Tokamak with Uncertainties in the Helium Ash
Conﬁnement Time

Abstract.
In this work we demostrate using a two-temperature volume averaged 0D
model that robust stabilization, with regard the helium ash conﬁnement time, of the
burn conditions of a tokamak reactor with the ITER FEAT design parameters can be
achieved using Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBNN). Alpha particle thermalization
time delay is taken into account in this model. The control actions implemented
by means of a RBNN, include the modulation of the DT refueling rate, a neutral
He-4 injection beam and auxiliary heating powers to ions and electrons; all of them
constrained to lie within allowable range values. Here we assume that the tokamak
follows the IPB98(y,2) scaling for the energy conﬁnement time, while helium ash
conﬁnement time is assumed to be independently estimated on-line. The DT and
helium ash particle conﬁnement times are assumed to keep a constant relationship
at all times. An on-line noisy estimation of the helium ash conﬁnement time due to
measurements is simulated by corrupting it with pseudo Gaussian noise.

1. Introduction

In a burning regime a reactor plasma must be heated mainly by the energetic particles
produced by fusion. In DT fueled reactors in particular the α-particles produced will
deposit, during slowing down, most of their energy to the plasma electrons. The highly
energetic alpha particles are expected to destabilize MHD modes known are Alfven
eigenmodes. The strong nonlinear coupling among the energy deposition proﬁle of
the alpha particles, the new MHD instabilities, the bootstrap current and the plasma
boundary, will make transport properties signiﬁcatively diﬀerent from those observed in
current tokamak experiments.[1] Hence, active control of particle densities and plasma
temperature will be essential in order to regulate the power density and to suppress
ﬂuctuations in plasma parameters due to turbulence and/or changes in conﬁnement
modes.

Here we report the results of a burn control study of an ITER FEAT-like tokamak
by means of radial basis artiﬁcial neural networks with Gaussian nodes in the hidden
layer and sigmoidals in the output layer using a two-temperature volume-averaged 0-D

model,[2] assuming the particle density is homogeneous throughout the plasma core,
with electrons and ions having the same radial proﬁle but diﬀerent peak temperatures.
In contrast with previous works[3] alpha particle thermalization time delay is taken
into account in this model.
It is assumed that the energy conﬁnement time of the
reactor follow the IPB98(y,2) scaling and that the helium ash particles conﬁnement
time τα, is independently estimated ”on-line”. Their current estimated value contains
noise due to turbulence and/or intrinsic measurement uncertainties, and is fed, together
with the electron and ions temperatures, the electron density and the helium ash
fraction, into the RBNN controller. The control actions are implemented through the
concurrent modulation of the refueling rate Sf , the neutral He-4 injection rate Sα, and
the auxiliary heating power density deposited to the ions and the electrons, Paux,i and
Paux,e, respectively, which can take values only within appropiate minima and maxima.

2. Model

The fusion reactor model considered here describes the time evolution of a quasineutral
plasma composed of electrons, 50:50 D-T fuel, helium ash, a small amount of Be and Ar
impurities, whose densities are ne, nDT , nα, nBe and nAr, respectively. The total thermal
energy is determined assuming Maxwellian distribution of the particles: the electrons
with a temperature proﬁle Te(r, t), and all the ions with the same radial proﬁle Ti(r, t).
The plasma heating takes place mainly by the thermalization of the alpha particles
produced by the fusion reactions together with an external RF electron and ion heating,
with a small contribution of joule heating. Bremsstrahlung is the only radiation loss
mechanism considered. We assume that both the density and the eﬀective charge of the
impurities particles remain constant at all times. The simple model used here, before
volume average is taken, is represented by the following coupled set of equations

respectively, to the bremsstrahlung radiation losses, the neoclassical resistivity and
the toroidal plasma current density. Zeﬀ is the eﬀective charge densiy; and τei
is
the relaxation time between the energy densities of the electrons and the ions. The
energy carried by the fusion alpha particles is Qα = 3.5 Mev; ffrac is the eﬀective
fraction of alpha particles not anomalously lost during thermalization; fe and fi are
the fraction of the alpha particles energy Qα, deposited to the electrons and to the
ions, respectively. The thermalization of the alpha particles produced by fusion is not
assumed instantaneous but time dependent with a distribution density function given by
ξth(t) for an alpha particle produced at t = 0. Similarly, the energy lost to the electrons
and the ions during the thermalization process are also taken to be time dependent
following the distribution functions ξe(t) and ξi(t), respectively.

The dynamical equations used in this work are the volume-averaged of the above
equations, assuming a time dependent but homogeneous particle density throughout the
plasma with temperature radial proﬁles of the form[4]

T (~r, t) = T0(t)[1 − (r/a)2]γt ,

(5)

with T0 the peak or central temperature, and a the tokamak’s minor radius. The radial
proﬁle parameter will be taken γt = 1.85 for both the electrons and the ions. Transport
losses are taken into account in the 0-D model through the energy conﬁnement time τE,
as well as by the D-T and the helium ash conﬁnement times τp and τα, respectively.

e0 = 23.6 keV together with T (n)

The nominal operating state is assumed to be n0 = 1.01 × 1020 m−3 for the electron
density; and T (n)
i0 = 23.0 keV, for the central temperatures
of the electrons and the ions, respectively. The helium ash fraction nominal value is
f0 = 0.045. The relative fractions of the Be and Ar impurities are assumed i fBe = 0.02
and fAr = 0.0012. The ionization charge will be assumed ZAr = 17, and ZBe = 4.
The coeﬃcient ffrac is assumed constant and equal to 0.9. The above values of the
plasma parameters will constitute the operating point for the ITER-FEAT like tokamak
reactor used in this work.[5,6] Here, we will assume that energy and particle scaling
laws are independent, but the DT and alpha particle conﬁnement times have a constant
relationship, τp = 0.6τα.

In practice, actual control actions are always constrained between a maximum and

a minimum value, thus we shall impose in the model described in Eqs. (1)-(4) that

0 ≤ Stotal
f
0 ≤ P total

≤ 2.3 × 1022 sec−1 ,

≤ 5.7 × 1020 sec−1 ,

0 ≤ Stotal
α
and 0 ≤ P total

aux,e ≤ 95.2 MW

aux,i ≤ 92.8 MW ;

(6)

these limits contain the required values for steady state operation for the range of
conﬁnement times considered here. The plasma core volume is assumed 837 m3.

Assuming quasineutrality we have , ne = nDT + 2nα + ZBenBe + ZArnAr; and after
taking volume average in Eqs. (1)-(4), we obtain a coupled set of nonlinear diﬀerential
equations for the time dependence of the electron density ne, the helium ash fraction
fα = nα/ne, and the peak electron and ions temperatures, Te0 and Ti0. Transport losses

time, as well as by the DT and helium ash conﬁnement times τp and τα, respectively.
thermalization process,
in the Introduction, during the
approximately 85% of the energy of the fusion alphas is absorbed by the electrons
and only 15% by the ions. Thus, in this work we take fe = 0.85 and fi = 0.15. On the
other hand, for the nominal operating plasma parameters of the ITER-FEAT design,
the time required by the alphas to reach the threshold energy of 0.5 MeV, below which
the energy is deposited mainly to the ions, for the nominal operating plasma parameters
of the ITER-FEAT design is approximately 0.18 seconds; afterwards its energy is mainly
deposited to the ions, taking an additional 0.06 seconds approximately to completely
thermalize to the volume average plasma temperature of approximately 8.0 keV.

In order to stabilize the system around a given state, the neural network must
provide appropriate values for the control variables, according to the current state of
the system. In all the simulated transients used in the training and testing of the neural
network in this and the next sections, we use a fourth order Adams-Moulton integration
scheme with two corrector-predictor steps, using a constant time step of length 0.02 sec.
The control actions are updated every 0.06 sec; in other words, the values of the control
variables in Eqs. (6) remain the constant for three consecutive time steps and then
updated, feeding to the RBNN the current values of the electron density, the fraction
of helium ash, the ion and electron peak temperatures and the energy and helium ash
conﬁnement times.

3. Simulation Results

We present here an example of a typical transient behaviour with the resulting network
controller, obtained after training the RBNN using a backpropagation through time
algorithm.[7] The tokamak reactor is assumed to follow the IPB98(y,2) scaling law,[8]

and the ratio r = τα/τE will be assumed to randomly ﬂuctuate following a Gaussian
distribution with mean value value ¯r = 4.5 with standard deviation 0.04 × ¯r; while
its ”on-line” estimation will also be a Gaussian stochastic variable with the same mean
value but with standard deviation 0.08× ¯r. In the transient shown below we choosed the
following initial conditions ne = 1.15 × n0 for the electron density; fα = 0.80 × f0, which
corresponds to a helium ash density of 8 % below its nominal value; and an initial peak
electron and ion temperatures of Te = 1.15 × T (n)
, respectively.
In Figures 1 and 2 we show the behaviour of the normalized electron density, helium
ash fraction, the electron temperature and the ions temperature, as function into the
transient.
In Figures 3 and 4 we show the time behaviour of the control variables,
normalized with respect their maxima allowable values, as function ito the transient.
It is observed that the RBNN controller is able to supress these ﬂuctuations within

In Figure 5 (left) we show the time behaviour of the

4. Conclusions

We have shown that burn control of an ITER-FEAT like tokamak with uncertainties
in the helium ash conﬁnement time can be succesfully achieved with radial basis neural
networks. Assuming the reactor follows IPB98(y,2) scaling law, and using a 0-D two
temperature volume-averaged model we illustrate by means of a typical transient that
the RBNN controller is robust with respect to noisy ”on-line” measurements of the ratio
τα/τE. A complete report of these results including ”on-line” measurement noise in the
estimation of the energy conﬁnement time is under preparation.[9]

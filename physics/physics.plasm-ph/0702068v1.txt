The nature of Ohm’s law is examined in a turbulent ﬂow of liquid sodium. A magnetic ﬁeld is
applied to the ﬂowing sodium, and the resulting magnetic ﬁeld is measured. The mean velocity
ﬁeld of the sodium is also measured in an identical-scale water model of the experiment. These two
ﬁelds are used to determine the terms in Ohm’s law, indicating the presence of currents driven by
a turbulent electromotive force. These currents result in a diamagnetic eﬀect, generating magnetic
ﬁeld in opposition to the dominant ﬁelds of the experiment. The magnitude of the ﬂuctuation-driven
magnetic ﬁeld is comparable to that of the ﬁeld induced by the sodium’s mean ﬂow.

The magnetic ﬁelds of stars and planets are generated
by the motion of an electrically conducting plasma or
liquid metal in the star or planet’s interior [1]. The mo-
tion of the ﬂuid across an existing seed magnetic ﬁeld
generates a motional electromotive force (EMF) that
drives currents, leading to a self-generated magnetic ﬁeld.
While large scale ﬂow may induce much of the mag-
netic ﬁeld, there is another means by which magnetic
ﬁeld may be generated: the interaction of velocity and
magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations [2]. If the magnetic and ve-
locity ﬁelds are separated into their mean (taken to be
the temporally averaged value) and ﬂuctuating compo-
nents, B = hBi + ˜B and V = hVi + ˜V, then the mean
electric current obeys an Ohm’s law of the form

hJi = σ (cid:16)hEi + hVi × hBi +

˜V × ˜B
(cid:10)

(cid:11)(cid:17) ,

(1)

where hJi is the average current density, σ the conduc-
tivity of the ﬂuid, and hEi the average electric ﬁeld. The
electric ﬁeld plays a passive role in the scenario stud-
ied here, merely maintaining ∇ · hJi = 0, and as such
will not be considered further. There are two signiﬁcant
source terms in Eq. 1: hVi × hBi represents the EMF
associated with the mean part of the velocity and mag-
netic ﬁelds, while
represents the EMF generated
by the ﬂuctuating part of the ﬁelds; velocity and mag-
netic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations can interact coherently to generate
mean currents.

˜V× ˜B

(cid:11)

The possibility of such a turbulent EMF has long been
recognized [2, 3, 4]. Much of its study has focused on
those currents generated by helical velocity ﬁeld ﬂuctu-
ations [5, 6], and several non-simply-connected liquid-
metal experiments have been constructed to mimic such
helical ﬂows [7, 8]. However, gradients in the intensity
of the ﬂuctuations can also generate currents. These
currents eﬀectively expel magnetic ﬂux from regions of
high turbulence to low, resulting in a diamagnetic ef-
fect [2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Such ﬂux expulsion
may explain [16] the weak magnetic ﬁeld at the center
of the galactic core [17] relative to the core’s external

ﬂux tubes [18], as well as concentrations of large scale
toroidal magnetic ﬁeld at the base of the stellar convec-
tion zone [19, 20, 21]. However, since ﬂuctuation-driven
ﬁelds cannot yet be isolated in astrophysical or geophys-
ical settings, whether turbulent EMFs play a signiﬁcant
role in the production of such magnetic ﬁelds remains an
open question.

In this Letter we present the spatial structure of such
ﬂuctuation-driven currents, as measured in the Madison
Dynamo Experiment. The net result is a strong turbu-
lent diamagnetism, reducing the magnitude of the mag-
netic ﬁeld throughout the experiment. A previous paper
showed that such currents must exist [22], but gave no
information about their structure. Here, direct measure-
ment of the experiment’s magnetic and velocity ﬁelds is
used to explicitly examine the structure of Ohm’s law.

The Madison Dynamo Experiment is a one-meter-
diameter sphere of ﬂowing liquid sodium [23]. Sodium
is chosen as the working ﬂuid for its high electrical con-
ductivity. An axisymmetric mean velocity ﬁeld is gener-
ated within the sodium by a pair of counter-rotating im-
pellers attached to shafts that enter the sphere through
each pole (with the shafts deﬁning the axis of symme-
try). The ﬂowing sodium is very turbulent, with a kinetic
Reynolds number Re ∼ 107. The unconstrained geome-
try of the experiment allows ﬂuctuations in the velocity
ﬁeld to develop up to the scale of the device. The ﬂuctu-
ating velocity ﬁeld generates a ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld
by advecting the mean magnetic ﬁeld of the experiment.

The nature of Ohm’s law is explored by measuring the
magnetic-ﬁeld-dependent terms in Eq. 1 to determine if
the induced magnetic ﬁeld is due solely to the action
of the mean ﬂow. An approximately-uniform magnetic
ﬁeld is applied to the ﬂowing sodium using a pair of ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld coils, and the total magnetic ﬁeld,
applied plus induced, is measured (the applied ﬁeld is suf-
ﬁciently weak that the velocity ﬁeld is unaﬀected). The
collection of magnetic ﬁeld data has been described pre-
viously [22]. Since both the mean velocity and applied

FIG. 1: Induced magnetic ﬁelds measured in the Madison Dynamo Experiment. (a) Mean measured poloidal and toroidal
ﬁeld values, scaled to the magnitude of the applied ﬁeld (50 Gauss), for an impeller rotation rate of 1000 RPM. The ﬁt (solid
lines) represents values predicted by a spherical harmonic expansion ﬁt to the data (diamonds). Error bars represent the RMS
ﬂuctuation levels of the signals. (b) The reconstructed ﬁeld, with the axis of symmetry oriented horizontally. Streamlines of
the poloidal ﬁeld are in the upper hemisphere and the toroidal ﬁeld strength is in the lower hemisphere. Measurement positions
are indicated with dots, and the impeller positions are indicated with rectangles.

magnetic ﬁelds are axisymmetric, the mean induced ﬁeld
is also axisymmetric (all data presented in this Letter
are axisymmetric). A spherical harmonic expansion of
the induced internal magnetic ﬁeld, in the poloidal and
toroidal directions, is ﬁtted to the most probable val-
ues of the measured magnetic ﬁeld. Since the sphere is
simply connected, a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld cannot be
applied from outside the sphere; all measured toroidal
magnetic ﬁeld is due to electrical currents ﬂowing within
the sodium.

For an impeller rotation rate of 1000 revolutions per
minute (RPM), the mean measured induced magnetic
ﬁeld ranges from 1.2 times the magnitude of the ap-
plied ﬁeld in the poloidal direction, to 1.1 times in the
toroidal direction [Fig. 1(a)]. The ﬁeld reconstructed
from the ﬁt indicates that the external poloidal magnetic
ﬁeld is dominated by a dipolar component that opposes
the externally-applied magnetic ﬁeld [Fig. 1(b)]. The re-
construction also demonstrates that the toroidal velocity
ﬁeld is eﬀective at generating toroidal magnetic ﬁeld from
the applied poloidal magnetic ﬁeld.

To distinguish between hBihVi×hBi,

the magnetic
ﬁeld induced by the mean ﬂow (∇ × hBihVi×hBi =
µ0 hJihVi×hBi ∼ µ0σ hVi × hBi), and hBih ˜V× ˜Bi, the
magnetic ﬁeld due to ﬂuctuations (∇ × hBih ˜V× ˜Bi ∼
˜V × ˜B
µ0σ
), the mean velocity ﬁeld of the sodium must
(cid:11)
be known. To this end an identical-scale water model of
the sodium experiment has been constructed [24]. At the
correct temperatures water and sodium have the same

(cid:10)

kinematic viscosity and similar densities. As a result
the two ﬂuids are nearly hydrodynamically identical and
water can be used to model the ﬂowing sodium. Like
the sodium apparatus, the water model is a one-meter-
diameter sphere in which impellers generate an axisym-
metric mean velocity ﬁeld. Stainless steel tubes, identical
to those containing the internal Hall probes in the sodium
experiment [23], enter the ﬂow at the same seven loca-
tions as in the sodium experiment. Unlike the sodium
apparatus, the water model is outﬁtted with ﬁve windows
that allow a Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) system to
directly measure the poloidal and toroidal components of
the water’s velocity ﬁeld. A spherical harmonic expan-
sion of the velocity ﬁeld is ﬁtted to the mean values of
these measurements to determine the mean velocity ﬁeld
of the ﬂowing sodium. For a impeller rotation rate of
1000 RPM, the measured velocity ﬁeld data yield a max-
imum poloidal speed of 2.5 m/s and a maximum toroidal
speed of 3.9 m/s [Fig. 2(a)]. As expected, the ﬂow is
counter-rotating in the toroidal direction and the poloidal
ﬂow rolls inward at the equator and outward at the poles
[Fig. 2(b)].

Once the mean velocity ﬁeld is known the magnetic
ﬁeld due to the mean ﬂow interacting with the mean
magnetic ﬁeld [Fig. 3(a)] and the magnetic ﬁeld driven
by the ﬂuctuations [Fig. 3(b)] are calculated. Like the ﬁt
to the measured magnetic and velocity ﬁelds, this calcu-
lation is done in a spherical harmonic basis, and involves
calculating the electrical potential of the experiment as-
suming ∇ · hJi = 0.

were present (i.e. the magnetic ﬁeld is solely explained
by hJihVi×hBi ∼ σ hVi × hBi), then the measured mean
magnetic ﬁeld [Fig. 1(b)] would be the same as the ﬁeld
due to the mean velocity ﬁeld [Fig. 3(a)].
Inspection
of these two ﬁgures reveals that this is not the case.
The prominent external dipole component of the mea-
sured poloidal magnetic ﬁeld is completely absent from
the magnetic ﬁeld due to the mean velocity ﬁeld, since the
mean axisymmetric velocity ﬁeld is incapable of produc-
ing it [22]. Also, the magnitude of the measured toroidal
magnetic ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly weaker than the toroidal
ﬁeld due to the mean velocity ﬁeld interacting with the
measured magnetic ﬁeld. Clearly, the inductive action of
the mean ﬂow alone is insuﬃcient to explain the mea-
sured ﬁelds: ﬂuctuations must be generating signiﬁcant
magnetic ﬁeld.

The magnetic ﬁeld generated by the ﬂuctuations has
several prominent features [Fig. 3(b)]. First, there is a
dipole component that dominates the magnetic ﬁeld out-
side the sphere, in the direction opposite the applied ﬁeld.
This is the source of the measured external dipole mo-
ment. Second, the toroidal ﬁeld induced by the ﬂuctua-
tions is in opposition to the ﬁeld induced by the mean ve-
locity ﬁeld interacting with the measured magnetic ﬁeld.
Thus, the ﬁeld induced by the ﬂuctuations is diamag-
netic with respect to the dominant poloidal and toroidal
ﬁelds within the experiment. The eﬀect is important
to the overall magnetic ﬁeld of the experiment, as the
ﬂuctuation-driven ﬁeld is a signiﬁcant fraction of both the
ﬁeld induced by the mean ﬂow, and the applied ﬁeld. The
strength of the toroidal diamagnetic ﬁeld near the poles

is about 50% of the magnitude of the ﬁeld induced by
the mean ﬂow, while the ﬂuctuation-driven dipole com-
ponent is 20% of the magnitude of the applied ﬁeld. The
ﬂuctuation-driven poloidal ﬁeld reduces the total poloidal
ﬂux through the equatorial plane by 10%.

Characterization of the ﬂuctuations which lead to this
turbulent EMF requires direct measurement of the ﬂuc-
tuating components of V and B. Since such measure-
ments are not currently available, it is not yet possible
to determine whether the observed diamagnetism is due
to gradients in ﬂuctuation levels, helical turbulence, or
some other eﬀect. Since the ﬂuctuation levels of the ex-
periment are greatest near the impellers, and weakest
near the sphere’s surface, ﬂux expulsion due to gradients
in turbulence levels is a natural candidate to explain the
observed diamagnetism, though it is not the only possible
explanation.

We note that the structure of the diamagnetic ﬁeld is
qualitatively similar to the ﬂuctuation-driven ﬁeld pre-
dicted by recent numerical simulations of the experi-
ment [25]. These simulations predict both the presence
of the dipole moment and the overall weakening of the
measured toroidal ﬁeld. However, the magnitude of the
ﬂuctuation-driven ﬁeld presented here is a factor of ﬁve
larger than that predicted by the simulations. The rea-
son for this discrepancy is not currently known, though
it may be related to diﬀerences in ﬂuid forcing or the
simulation’s large value of magnetic Prandtl number.

In summary, mean magnetic and velocity ﬁeld mea-
surements have been used to determine the structure
of ﬂuctuation-driven currents in the Madison Dynamo

opposition to the experiment’s dominant magnetic ﬁeld.
This is the ﬁrst observation of turbulent diamagnetism
in a laboratory setting. Analysis of the nature of the
ﬂuctuations which leads to this turbulent EMF is ongo-
ing, and future work will focus on further understanding
the localized regions of current generation. Given that
the observed eﬀect is diamagnetic, it indicates that such
ﬁelds could be a hindrance to the development of mag-
netically self-exciting geophysical and astrophysical sys-
tems, as well as simply-connected liquid-metal dynamo
experiments.

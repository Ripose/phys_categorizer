Full kinetic dynamics of a perpendicular collisionless shock is studied by means of a one-dimensional electro-
magnetic full particle simulation. The present simulation domain is taken in the shock rest frame in contrast to the
previous full particle simulations of shocks. Preliminary results show that the downstream state falls into a unique
cyclic reformation state for a given set of upstream parameters through the self-consistent kinetic processes.

Introduction

Collisionless shocks are universal processes in space and
are observed in laboratory, astrophysical, and space plasmas,
including astrophysical jets, an interstellar medium, the he-
liosphere, and the planetary magnetosphere. In the classic
picture, collisionless shocks arise in a collisionless plasma
streaming with a supersonic velocity against another colli-
sionless plasma. Generation of plasma waves and turbu-
lences, plasma heating and acceleration, and electromagnetic
radiation processes at collisionless shocks are of great in-
terest in astrophysics, solar physics, planetary physics, geo-
physics, and plasma physics. Detailed scientiﬁc issues in
collisionless shock physics are described in Lembege et al.
(2004). Kinetic simulations of collisionless shocks are es-
sential approaches to solve these scientiﬁc issues.

There are several different methods for exciting collision-
less shocks in numerical simulations of plasmas. The mag-
netic piston method (Lembege and Dawson, 1987a; Lem-
bege and Savoini, 1992) is widely used in full particle simu-
lations, in which a plasma is accelerated by an external cur-
rent pulse applied at one side of the simulation domain. The
simulation domain is taken in the upstream rest frame. The
plasma is pushed by the “magnetic piston” into the back-
ground plasma, and the external pulse develops into a shock
wave. Another method widely used is the injection method
(Quest, 1985; Shimada and Hoshino, 2000; Schmitz et al.,
2002a, b; Nishimura et al., 2003; Scholer et al., 2003; Lee
et al., 2004), in which a plasma is injected from one side of
the simulation domain and is reﬂected back when it reaches
the other side. (Therefore this method is also called the re-
ﬂection method or wall method.) The simulation domain is
taken in the downstream rest frame, and a shock wave is ex-
cited due to the interaction between the reﬂected and the in-
jected plasma. There are also further methods, such as the
ﬂow-ﬂow method (Omidi and Winske, 1992) and the plasma

release method (Ohsawa, 1985), used in hybrid and full par-
ticle simulations. A detailed description for each method is
given in Lembege (2003).

In these methods, an excited shock wave propagates up-
stream. Therefore, it is necessary to take a very long simula-
tion domain in the propagation direction of the shock wave
in order to study a long-time evolution of the excited shock
wave. This makes it difﬁcult to perform multidimensional
simulations even with a current supercomputer. In this let-
ter, we ﬁrst attempt to perform a full particle simulation of
a collisionless shock in the shock rest frame: the collision-
less shock is excited by using the “relaxation method” which
was used in hybrid code simulations in 1980’s (Leroy et al.,
1981, 1982; Kan and Swift, 1983). This method has not been
used in full particle simulations due to several difﬁculties in
numerical techniques.

2. Simulation Model

Our simulation code (Umeda, 2004) is an improved
version of one-dimensional Kyoto university electromag-
netic particle code (Omura and Matsumoto, 1993), where
Maxwell’s equations and the relativistic equations of mo-
tion for individual electrons and ions are solved in a self-
consistent manner. The continuity equation for charge is also
solved to compute the exact current density given by the mo-
tion of the charged particles (Umeda et al., 2003).

The simulation domain is taken in a one-dimensional sys-
tem along the x-axis. The initial state consists of two uni-
form regions separated by a discontinuity. In the upstream
region that is taken in the left hand side of the simulation
domain, electrons and ions are distributed uniformly in x
and are given random velocities (vx, vy, vz) to approximate
shifted Maxwellian momentum distributions with the drift
pe1/e2, isotropic
velocity ux1, number density n1 ≡ ǫ0meω2
temperatures Te1 ≡ mev2
ti1, where
m, e, ωp1 and vt1 are the mass, charge, upstream plasma
frequency and upstream thermal velocity, respectively.
In
this letter, subscripts “1” and “2” denote “upstream” and
“downstream”, respectively. The upstream magnetic ﬁeld

te1 and Ti1 ≡ miv2

2

B0y1 ≡ −meωce1/e is also assumed to be uniform, where
ωc1 is the upstream cyclotron frequency (with sign included).
The downstream region taken in the right-hand side of the
simulation domain is prepared similarly with the drift veloc-
ity ux2, density n2, isotropic temperatures Te2 and Ti2, and
magnetic ﬁeld B0y2. In this letter we assume a perpendic-
ular shock (i.e., B0x = 0). As a motional electric ﬁeld, an
external electric ﬁeld E0z = −ux1B0y1 = −ux2B0y2 is also
applied in both upstream and downstream regions. At the left
boundary of the simulation domain, we inject plasmas with
the same quantities as those in the upstream region, while
plasmas with the same quantities as those in the downstream
region are also injected from the right boundary. We adopted
absorbing boundaries to suppress non-physical reﬂection of
electromagnetic waves at both ends of the simulation domain
(Umeda et al., 2001).

In the present simulation, the time, velocity, and posi-
tion are normalized by the initial upstream electron plasma
frequency ωpe1 = 1.0, upstream electron thermal velocity
vte1 = 1.0, and upstream electron Debye length λe1 ≡
vte1/ωpe1 = 1.0, respectively. The initial temperatures in
both upstream and downstream regions are assumed to be
isotropic. In the upstream region, we assume a low beta and
weakly magnetized plasma such that βe1 = βi1 = 0.125
and ωce1/ωpe1 = −0.05, which are similar to the recent full
particle simulations (Shimada and Hoshino, 2000; Schmitz
et al., 2002a, b; Lee et al., 2004). The light speed in the
present simulation is given as c = 80.0. The bulk ﬂow veloc-
ity of the upstream plasma is assumed to be ux1 = 4.0 which
corresponds to the Alfv´en Mach number MA = 10.0. The
ion-to-electron temperature ratio, rT ≡ Ti/Te is assumed to
be unity in the upstream region (rT 1 = 1). In addition to the
upstream quantities ux1, ωpe1, ωce1, vte1, and rT 1, we need
the downstream ion-to-electron temperature ratio, rT 2, so as
to uniquely determine the other downstream quantities ux2,
ωpe2, ωce2, and vte2 from the shock jump conditions for a
magnetized two-ﬂuid plasma consisting of electrons and ions
with the equal bulk velocity and the equal number density.
We adopt rT 2 = 4.0 so that the thermal velocities of both
downstream electrons and ions become much slower than the
light speed. However, note that we can choose an arbitrary
value for rT 2. As can be seen later, the ﬁnal cyclic refor-
mation state does not depend on the choice of rT 2. Since we
performed the present simulation on a personal computer, we
used a reduced ion-to-electron mass ratio rm = 100 for com-
putational efﬁciency. With these parameters, we obtain the
initial downstream quantities as ωpe2 = 1.95, ωce2 = −0.19,
ux2 = 1.05, and vte2 = 7.55.

We used 4096 cells for the upstream region and 8192 cells
for the downstream region, respectively. The grid spacing
and time step of the present simulation are ∆x/λe1 = 1.0
and ωpe1∆t = 0.01, respectively. We used 128 pairs of
electrons and ions per cell in the upstream region and 512
pairs of electrons and ions per cell in the downstream region,
respectively. It should be noted that such a few number of
particles per cell is not enough to suppress the enhanced
thermal ﬂuctuations of particle-in-cell codes. In the present
simulation, however, the numerical noises due to random
motions of individual particles are substantially reduced by
adopting second-order schemes (Umeda, 2004).

time. The time and position are normalized by ωci2 and ρi ≡ ux1/ωci2,
respectively. The magnitude of magnetic ﬁeld is normalized by B0y1.

3. Simulation Result

Figure 1 shows the transverse magnetic ﬁeld By as a func-
tion of position and time. The discontinuity exists at x = 0
initially. However, the shock front shifts downstream due to
the cyclotron motion of upstream ions that penetrate into the
downstream region. A new shock front appears at x/ρi ≃ 1.
The period from ωci2t = 0 to 7 is the transition epoch from
It
the initial to the cyclic reformation state (see below).
should be also noted that the initial discontinuity causes the
non-physical generation of electromagnetic waves at the on-
set, because Ampere’s law ∂By
∂x = µ0Jz is not satisﬁed at
the initial state. However, the electromagnetic waves are per-
fectly absorbed at both boundaries, and they do never affect

The typical processes for the self-reformation of perpen-
dicular collisionless shocks are as follows (Quest, 1985;
Lembege and Savoini, 1992; Schmitz et al., 2002a, b;
Nishimura et al., 2003; Hada et al., 2003). A part of ions are
reﬂected back from the shock ramp. The shock foot region
broadens toward upstream as the reﬂected ions penetrate.
However, the reﬂected ions return to the downstream region
because of the cyclotron motion. The reﬂected ions can in-
teract with upstream ions resulting in the self-formation of a
new shock ramp in the old shock foot region. Finally a new
shock front appears at x/ρi ≃ 1, and ions are again reﬂected
toward the upstream region from the new shock ramp.

The present simulation result shows that the timescale of
the self reformation is almost equal to the cyclotron period
of the downstream ions (ωci2t ≃ 2π), which is in agree-
ment with the previous studies (Quest, 1985, Lembege and
Savoini, 1992; Schmitz et al., 2002a, b; Nishimura et al.,
2003; Scholer et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2004). Scholer et al.
(2003) showed that the self reformation process is not a com-
putational artifact with the real ion-to-electron mass ratio,
while the ratio of electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency is
smaller (ωpe1/ωce1 < 10). On the other hand, Lee et al.
(2004) generated the self reformation more than six cycles,
while their mass ratio is much smaller (rm = 20). In the
present shock rest frame, we have also conﬁrmed the shock
reformation process up to six cycles with rm = 100 but with
less grid cells.

In order to analyze the downstream condition in the cyclic
reformation state, we plot in Figure 2 spatial proﬁles of the
magnetic energy density |µ0By|2, the ion-to-electron tem-
, the
perature ratio perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld r

number density n, and parallel and perpendicular thermal en-
ergy density components T E|| and T E⊥, and the drift energy
density DE for electron and ions at ωci2t = 38.1.

In the present shock rest frame model, a shock transition
layer is self-consistently formed due to relaxation of the two
plasmas with different quantities. The downstream region at
the resulting cyclic reformation state is quite different from
that of the initial state. For both electrons and ions, the spa-
tial proﬁles of thermal energy density component parallel to
the ambient magnetic ﬁeld are similar to those of number
densities. This means that the downstream parallel tempera-
tures for both electrons and ions become almost the same as
those in the upstream region, i.e., Te||1 ≃ Te||2 ≃ Ti||1 ≃
Ti||2. On the other hand, the ratio of the ion-to-electron per-
pendicular temperature ratio is very large (∼ 102) in the tran-
sition region, and is typically rT ⊥2 ∼ 10 in the downstream
region (rT ⊥2 = 5.0 ∼ 20.0).

As seen in Figure 1, the excited shock wave propagates
slowly downstream with the roughly estimated shock speed
U/ux1 = 0.0282. The downstream electron and ion number
densities in the cyclic reformation state become smaller than
those at the initial state, whereas the downstream electron
and ion bulk velocities become faster than those at the initial
state. We performed several additional runs with different
system sizes and found that the simulation results, i.e., the
shock speeds and the spatial proﬁle of all physical quantities
at an arbitrary time are almost unchanged. In other words,
the present system size is long enough to discuss the kinetic
processes in the shock transition region.

In the downstream region of the cyclic reformation state,
the physical quantities ﬂuctuate and are not spatially uni-

form. We solved the shock jump conditions for anisotropic
plasmas (Hudson, 1970) as a reference. Taking into ac-
count the shock speed and the typical downstream quan-
tities vte||2 = vte1, rT ||2 = rT 1, and rT ⊥2 = 10, the
other downstream quantities are obtained as ωpe2 = 1.71,
ωce2 = −0.146, ux2 = 1.33, and vte⊥2 = 5.42. These
quantities are plotted in Figure 2 with dashed lines. A differ-
ence between the quasi-steady state by the shock jump con-
ditions and the simulated downstream state is because of the
dynamical shock reformation process. This might be another
reason why we did not obtain the rigorous shock rest frame.
For a given set of upstream parameters, the ﬂuid shock
jump conditions cannot give the downstream state uniquely.
In the electron-ion ﬂuid, the total plasma pressure is deﬁned
as the sum of the electron and ion pressures, P = n(Te +Ti),
and the shock jump conditions allow us to take an arbitrary
downstream temperature ratio, rT 2. However, the value of
rT 2 is determined by the kinetic dynamics as seen in the
simulation result. We performed several additional runs with
different initial downstream values, and conﬁrmed that the
shock speed in our reference frame and downstream thermal
properties at the cyclic reformation state do not depend on
the initial value of rT 2 but on the other initial downstream
parameters, such as the magnetic ﬁeld, the number density,
the bulk velocity, and the total plasma pressure.

In the bottom panels of Figure 2 we show perpendicu-
lar kinetic energy versus position diagrams for electrons and
ions. We found that there exists a supra-thermal component
of electrons at two local areas. The previous works reported
the electron surﬁng acceleration with electrostatic solitary
waves in the transition region (Hoshino and Shimada, 2002;
Schmitz et al., 2002a, b). In the present simulation, we con-
ﬁrmed the existence of solitary waves in the shock foot re-
gion, where the maximum kinetic energy is about 30 times as
much energy as the initial kinetic energy. On the other hand,
another supra-thermal component of electrons due to the ion
deceleration is seen at the overshoot, where the maximum ki-
netic energy is much more (> 60KEe1) than that of the non-
thermal electrons via the surﬁng mechanism. Although this
process was also found in the previous simulations (Hoshino
and Shimada, 2002; Schmitz et al., 2002a, b), the maximum
kinetic energy in the present simulation is more than that in
their simulations. We expect that this process becomes more
signiﬁcant with a larger mass ratio.

4. Conclusion

We have developed a shock rest frame model for full par-
ticle simulations of perpendicular collisionless shocks based
on the relaxation method used in the previous hybrid sim-
ulations (e.g., Leroy et al., 1981, 1982). We reconﬁrmed
both formation of microscopic solitary structures due to the
current-driven instability and cyclic reformation for a long
time with a much smaller simulation domain. The shock rest
frame model allows us to perform multidimensional full par-
ticle simulations of planar shocks more readily with current
supercomputers. We are extending the present shock rest
frame model to oblique shocks. Preliminary results show
that the present rest frame model is very useful to excite

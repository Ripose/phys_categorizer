Connection between the Dielectric and the Ballistic Treatment

of Collisional Absorption

Abstract

In this work two important models of treating collisional absorption in a laser driven plasma
are compared, the dielectric and the ballistic model. We will see that there exists a remarkable
connection between these basic approaches which could give a hint how to overcome the inherent
limitations. The approximations made in the models are not identical and lead to diﬀerent
advantages and disadvantages.
We notice that the dieletric model is able to handle screening in a selfconsistent manner, but is
limited to ﬁrst order in the electron-ion interaction. The ballistic model calculates the electron-
ion collision exactly in each order of the interaction, but has to introduce a cut-oﬀ to incorporate
screening eﬀects. This means in the context of kinetic theory that the electron-ion correlation
has to be calculated either in random phase or in ladder approximation, or, in other words, the
linearized Lenard-Balescu or Boltzmann collision term has to be used.

This equation deﬁnes the collision frequency νei(v). The Coulomb logarithm ln Λ depends on two
cut-oﬀ lengths bmax and bmin which describe the dynamical screening of the Coulomb potential and
the quantummechanical closing of the singularity at the origin on the scale of a De Broglie wavelength.
So we assume

Notice that the collision parameter b⊥ for perpendicular deﬂection is an inherent quantity for the
Coulomb collision and not a cut-oﬀ.
Calculating the ensemble average over an isotropic distribution function, where the Coulomb loga-
rithm is treated as a constant, we could determine the time-dependent collision frequency

In order to compare this result with the dielectric model, we have to determine the time averaged
energy absorption of the plasma in the laser ﬁeld for a harmonic electron movement. The energy
absorption is connected to the time-averaged collision frequency νei by

1.2 The Dielectric Model

In many papers about collisional absorption in plasmas the dielectric theory was the starting point,
refs. [2], [3], [4]. As this theory is well known we only present the result for the cycle averaged absorped
energy density

The upper integral limit kmax in eq. (2) is necessary in the classical case due to the divergence
of the integral for large k. In the quantum case an additional term exp(−k2/8k2
B) (kB De Broglie
wavenumber) appears inside the integral of eq. (2), which conﬁrms the assumption that the De Broglie
wavelength has to be considered in kmax, refs. [5], [6].

Comparing the dielectric inverse screening length kmin and the one introduced in the ballistic model,
Fig. 2, we come to a good qualitative agreement. Nervertheless, a quantitative diﬀerence appears.
It must be kept in mind that we handled the Coulomb logarithm as a constant during the ensemble
average and also during the time average, which is not done in the dielectric model. The discrepancy
should decrease if we overcome this approximation, which will be the subject of further investigations.

3 Conclusions

It was shown in the previous section that there exists a strong connection between the dielectric
and the ballistic model. This results from the fact that the integral kernel F (k, ω, ˆvos
), eq. (3), only
vth
becomes a function of vos/vth and agrees with the integral term of eq. (1). When calculating it is
essential to include enough orders of Bessel functions for large k. So, as the integral in eq. (3) runs up
to large k, it is never a good approximation to take only a few orders of Bessel functions, which was
done by many authors to get analytical expressions for the absorption. Furthermore, it is much easier
to ﬁnd approximations of the term in eq. (1), ref. [1], than of the complicated expression eq. (3).

When making the approximation eq. (5) in the dielectric treatment we could see the diﬀerence be-
tween both models.
In case of the dielectric model the collision parameter b⊥ for perpendicular
deﬂection is missing. This is exactly the term which leads beside the De Broglie wavelength to the
convergence of the collision integral for small collision parameters which means large k in eq. (2). The
disappearance of that length is a consequence of the weak coupling approximation in the dielectric
theory, equivalent to the ﬁrst order Born approximation or straight orbit assumption. We could
expect that the integral kernel F (k, ω, ˆvos
⊥ when we go

beyond the weak coupling approximation, which leads to a reduced absorption. This is in agreement
to stopping power calculations, ref. [7], where the authors found an overestimation of the stopping
power in the case of the ﬁrst order Born approximation in the electron-ion coupling. Including the
static shielded T matrix they found good agreement with numerical results.

Abstract

Analyzing the production of weakly relativistic plasma produced by mi-

crowave ﬁelds with circular polarization the electron distribution function is

obtained to be non-equilibrium and anisotropic. Furthermore, it is shown that

produced plasma is accelerated on the direction of propagation of microwave

electric ﬁelds. The electron velocity on this direction strongly depends on

electron origination phase, electric ﬁeld phase, and amplitude of microwave

electric ﬁeld. Making use of the dielectric tensor obtained for this plasma, it

is shown that the wiebel instability develops due to the anisotrpic property of

I. INTRODUCTION

A microwave produced gas discharge is a rather complicated phenomenon ex-

hibiting a variety of features. Numerous theoretical and experimental studies have

been devoted to this phenomenon. The interaction between intense (MW) ﬁelds

and neutral gas open new possibilities for studying the fundamental property of this

produced plasma. In a plasma produced in the interaction of the MW ﬁeld with a

gas, the electron distribution is non-equilibrium and may give rise to various plasma

instability.1 The main features of this interaction is the gas ionization mechanism.

Furthermore, the key role in the plasma processes is played by the kinetic eﬀects

associated with the speciﬁc features of the electron distribution. Due to the short

interaction times, these features are governed completely by the pulse parameter of

microwave ﬁeld. In addition the interaction between intense MW ﬁelds with an inho-

mogeneous plasma results in variety of phenomena such as frequency up shift during

the propagation of a pulse microwave ﬁeld through a plasma.2 In such a strong wave

ﬁeld the electron oscillatory energy ǫe is much higher than the ionization energy Iioniz

of gas atoms

where ω0 is the radiation frequency, m is electron mass,and E0 is the electric ﬁeld

strength. When ﬁeld amplitude is comparable to the atomic ﬁeld strength Ea

≈
109 V cm−1 the tunneling ionization becomes an important mechanism for di-

rect ionization of the gas atoms. This eﬀect was completely studied in the diﬀerent

papers.3,4,5 On the other hand relativistic eﬀects come in to play when kinetic energy

of electron oscillation in an electromagnetic ﬁeld is comparable with the electron rest

mass energy. Moreover, the microwave ﬁelds generated by the present day pulsed

duration sources are weaker than the atomic ﬁeld and are capable of manifesting

2

weakly relativistic behavior of electron produced. On the oder side, the aforemen-

tioned eﬀect can be easily manifested by intense laser pulse.6

In the previous paper we restricted our study to the non-relativistic regime but

here we consider weakly relativistic eﬀects that occur during gas ionization by a

strong microwave ﬁeld.7 In the present paper we consider the interaction of circularly

polarized microwave pulse ﬁelds with frequency about ω0

with a neutral gas taking into weakly relativistic eﬀects. This pulsed radiation source

is capable of generating the radiation with an intensity of about 108W cm−2, whose

electric ﬁeld being E0

is much weaker than the atomic ﬁeld Ea. In

weakly relativistic case vE

In this case, also we study the electron distribution function (EDF) and the

stability of the discharge plasma in the aforementioned frequency range at weakly

relativistic electron oscillation energy ǫe .

This work is organized in four section. In sec. II. we will obtain produced EDF

generated by the interaction of the circularly-polarized MW ﬁeld with a neutral gas.

In sec.III. we will obtain the dielectric tensor element for this produced plasma. In

sec.IV. we will study the stability of produced plasma and ﬁnd the wiebel instability

growth rate of wiebel instability caused by the anisotropic property of the electron

distribution function. Finally, a summary and conclusion is presented.

II. ELECTRON DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION

Under condition (1) the thermal velocity of the electrons in a discharge plasma can

be neglected in comparison to the electron oscillation velocity in the MW radiation

ﬁeld. Since the collision frequency is much smaller than the MW ﬁeld frequency, we

can ignore the collisional stochastization of the forced electron oscillation as well.

Furthermore, if plasma density ne(t) produced by the ﬁeld during gas breakdown, is

less than the critical density (that is ω2

0 > ω2

Le = 4πne2/m) we can neglect the eﬀect

of the polarization ﬁeld. Moreover, the plasma density is assumed to be less than the

neutral gas density n0 so that the latter can be considered constant. We also suppose

that the ﬁeld was adiabatically switched on in the inﬁnite past. Furthermore, we

can assume that the MW radiation electric ﬁeld amplitude E0 is constant during a

single ﬁeld period. Therefore, the kinetic equation for the plasma electrons produced

in the gas breakdown by a strong pulsed ﬁeld can be written as follows

where E0(ξ) and B0(ξ) are electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a wave propagating along

the Z-axis, respectively; ξ = ω0t

k0r = ω0(t

z/c), and ωioniz is the ionization prob-

−

−

ability of the gas atoms. Here δ( p) is the delta function of the electron momentum.

In the weakly-relativistic limit, we can assuming that the electric ﬁeld depends only

on time. In the case of MW breakdown, electron-impact ionization is governed by

the ionization probability ωioniz. For a MW discharge Eq. (2) for f0( p, t) is a homo-

geneous integro-diﬀerential equation whose positive eigenvalue γ( E0) determines

the avalanche ionization constant. However, we can neglect the right-hand side of

Eq. (2) in the ﬁrst approximation and calculate the EDF directly by solving the

Vlasov equation under the following condition,

ω0

γ( E0), ωioniz

≫

(3)

where the avalanche ionization constant γ( E0) is to be determined.8 In this case,

the condition (3) depends strongly on the neutral gas density and is well satisﬁed

at gas pressures of p0

10

100 Torr.

In this approximation, to calculate the

electron energy distribution function, we assume the ﬁeld components to be circularly

polarized

Ex = E0 sin ω0t,

Ey = E0 cos ω0t,

Ez = 0,

(4)

where, ω0 is the frequency of MW ﬁeld. Moreover, electric ﬁeld amplitude E0

describes the slowly varying (over the ﬁeld period) microwave pulsed envelope. con-

sider the condition (3) and solving Eq. (2) by characteristic method the equation of

motion for electrons can be obtained as follows

from this we ﬁnd solution of the vlasov kinetic equation-characteristics

We can see that, the electron distribution function depends on phase ﬁeld ϕ and

electron origination phase ϕ0. Therefore, we must average of electron distribution

function over the phase ﬁeld period and origination phase. The projection of the

phase portrait of the electrons onto the (vx, vy) plane is as follows. The electron

trajectories uniformly cover a circle of radius vE, whose center precesses about the

origin of the coordinates and describes a circumference of the same radius at a

rate equal to the microwave frequency. Consequently, the averaging procedure can

be performed separately for the longitudinal and transverse velocity components.

III. DIELECTRIC TENSOR

In the previous section we found the distribution function (9) for electrons in

a discharge plasma is highly anisotropic with respect to the direction of the MW

radiation ﬁeld, which, ﬁrst of all, should result in the onset of the well-known wiebel

instability.7 In order to convince ourselves that this conclusion is valid and to ﬁnd

the instability growth rate, we turn to the adiabatic approximation, assuming that

the instability grows faster than the plasma density.5,9 In this approximation, we can

use the following dispersion relation for small perturbation

IV. STABILITY OF THE PRODUCED PLASMA

As known the process of the gas breakdown by the MW ﬁelds is unstable with

respect to the excitation of longitudinal electric ﬁelds and transverse magnetic ﬁelds.

The former is caused due to the positive derivative of the EDF and the latter, treated

below, is related to the anisotropy of the EDF.9 In this step we study the weibel in-

stability, by analyzing electron perturbations propagate across the microwave ﬁeld.

Therefore, by averaging dielectric tensor (13) over the φ between [0, 2π] and sub-

stituting into the dispersion equation (10) by assuming 2kv2

E/ωc < 1 yields the

dispersion relation for electron perturbations propagating across the MW radiation

V. CONCLUSION

Using a simplest model, we are calculated the weakly-relativistic EDF for plasma

produced by the interaction of an intense microwave pulse ﬁeld with a neutral gas.

The resulting EDF, which can be drive analytically for circularly polarized MW ﬁeld,

is highly anisotropic, which indicates that microwave driven plasmas are subject

to weibel instability.

In the non-relativistic produced plasma7 the electrons only

9

oscillate on the MW ﬁeld direction but on the weakly-relativistic produced plasma

the electrons have velocity perpendicular the radiation ﬁeld. In this case the electrons

originating with zero energy are entrained by MW ﬁeld in a certain phase and are

accelerated to weakly-relativistic velocities, so that the accelerated electrons move

essentially in phase with the MW ﬁeld. Then, this process might be repeated for the

electrons originating over the next time interval, and so on. Analyzing the dispersion

equation and obtaining the growth rate of the instability produced we found that

the growth rate modiﬁed by an exceed positive term with respect to non-relativistic

case. Also the instability frequency has a very small real part that can be represent

the entrain of electrons in MW ﬁelds.

Abstract

−

Exact solutions of the equation governing the equilibrium magetohydrody-
namic states of an axisymmetric plasma with incompressible ﬂows of arbitrary
direction [H. Tasso and G.N. Throumoulopoulos, Phys. Pasmas 5, 2378 (1998)]
are constructed for toroidal current density proﬁles peaked on the magnetic axis
ku, where S = d/du [̺(dΦ/du)2] (k is a
in connection with the ansatz S =
parameter, u labels the magnetic surfaces; ̺(u) and Φ(u) are the density and the
electrostatic potential, respectively). They pertain to either unbounded plasmas
of astrophysical concern or bounded plasmas of arbitrary aspect ratio. For k = 0,
a case which includes ﬂows parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld, the solutions are ex-
pressed in terms of Kummer functions while for k
= 0 in terms of Airy functions.
On the basis of a tokamak solution with k
= 0 describing a plasma surrounded
by a perfectly conducted boundary of rectangular cross-section it turns out that
the Shafranov shift is a decreasing function which can vanish for a positive value
of k. This value is larger the smaller the aspect ratio of the conﬁguration.

1. Introduction

Flow is a common phenomenon in astrophysical plasmas, in particular let us
mention here the plasma jets that are observed to be spat out from certain galactic
nuclei and propagate to supergalactic scales, e.g. Ref. [1]. Also, there has been
established in fusion devices that sheared ﬂow can reduce turbulence either in the
edge region (L-H transition) or in the central region (internal transport barriers)
thus resulting in a reduction of the outward particle and energy transport, e.g.
Ref. [2].

In an attempt to contribute to the understanding of the equilibrium proper-
ties of ﬂowing plasmas we considered cylindrical [3, 4], axisymmetric [5, 6], and
helically symmetric [7] steady states with incompressible ﬂows in the framework
of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by including the convective ﬂow term in
the momentum equation. Also we studied the equilibrium of a gravitating plasma
with incompressible ﬂow conﬁned by a point-dipole magnetic ﬁeld [8]. For an ax-
isymmetric magnetically conﬁned plasma the equilibrium satisﬁes [in cylindrical
coordinates (R, z, φ) and convenient units] the elliptic diﬀerential equation for
the poloidal magnetic ﬂux-function ψ,

Relation (2) then determines the pressure. For S = constant, exact solutions
which extend the well known Solov´ev one were derived in Ref. [6]. Owing to the
ﬂow and its shear a variety of new conﬁgurations are possible having either one or
two stagnation points in addition to the usual ones with a single magnetic axis.
The aim of the present work is to construct exact solutions of equation (4)
u and examine their properties. The solutions are of the form (7) below
for S
in Section 2. This form is advantageous in that boundary conditions associated
with either bounded laboratory plasmas or unbounded plasmas of astrophysical
concern can be treated in a uniﬁed manner by adjusting appropriately the pa-
rameters it contains. As a matter of fact certain of the solutions we construct
constitute extensions of the Hernegger-Maschke solution of the Grad-Schl¨uter-
Shafranov equation for bounded plasmas [9, 10] and a recent one for unbounded
plasmas derived by Bogoyavlenskij [11].

The work is organized as follows. Exact solutions of (4) for S

u are con-
structed in Section 2. The ﬂow impact on the Shafranov shift is then examined in
Section 3 on the basis of a particular solution describing a tokamak conﬁguration
of arbitrary aspect ratio being contained within a perfectly conducting boundary
of rectangular cross-section. Section 4 summarizes the Conclusions.

This is appropriate for considering various equilibrium conﬁgurations in connec-
tion with diﬀerent boundary conditions. In particular, the term xn which makes u
to vanish on the axis of symmetry is associated with either compact tori or spher-
ical tokamak conﬁgurations. Plasmas surrounded by a ﬁxed perfectly conducting
boundary can be considered by setting γ = 0. Unbounded plasmas are connected
with γ = 1, the exponential term guaranteeing smooth behaviour at large dis-
tances. It is noted that for static equilibria (Mp = c3 = 0) the cases n = γ = 0
and (n = 0, γ = 1) were considered in Refs. [9, 10], and [11], respectively.

2.1 Unbounded plasmas (γ = 1) and c3 = 0

It is ﬁrst noted that the case c3 = 0 includes ﬂows parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld for Φ′ = 0, viz. when the electric ﬁeld vanishes. For c3 = 0, (1) becomes
identical in form with the Grad-Schl¨uter-Shafranov equation and (9) reduces to

−

The solutions of this equation can be expressed in terms of Kummer or conﬂuent
hypergeometric functions ([12], p. 503; [13], p. 137). In particular, for the two
roots of (12) we have:
2.1.a k1 =

n
The solution of (13) is

−

W (x) = x [D1M(τ + 1, 2, x) + D2U(τ + 1, 2, x)] ,

where M and U are the Kummer functions of ﬁrst and second kind, respectively,
and D1, D2 are constants. Consequently, the solution of the original equation (4)
is written in the form

u(x, z) = x [D1M(τ + 1, 2, x) + D2U(τ + 1, 2, x)] exp (

x/2)

[A sin(ωz) + B cos(ωz)] .

−

(14)

For special values of τ and n the Kummer functions reduce to simpler classical
functions or polynomials (see Ref.
[12], p. 509, table 13.6) ; in particular, for
m, where m is a non-negative integer, and n = 0 they reduce to Laguerre
τ =
polynomials. Solutions of this kind for static equilibria (Mp = 0) were derived
in Ref. [11] and employed to model astrophysical jets and solar prominences. It
may also be noted here that a continuation of this study and related studies were
reported in Refs. [14, 15] and [16].

u(x, z) = x2[D1M(τ + 2, 4, x) + D2U(τ + 2, 4, x)] exp (

expressed in terms of simpler classical functions or polynomials, e.g. for n = 0
they are expressed in terms of Coulomb wave functions. In this case respective
static solutions (Mp = 0) were constructed in Refs. [9] and [10].

rectangular cross-section of dimensions a and b and its geometric center to be
located at R0 (Fig. 1).

On the basis of equation (25), ∆ξ has been determined numerically as a
function of the ﬂow parameter c3 (Fig. 2). It is recalled that c3 is related to the
density and the electric ﬁeld and their variation perpendicular to the magnetic
surfaces by (5). As can be seen in Fig. 2, ∆ξ is a decreasing function of c3 which

8

goes down to zero sharply as c3 approaches a positive value, this value being
larger the smaller is the aspect ration R0/b of the conﬁguration. This result is
independent of the plasma elongation a/b. It is ﬁnally noted that suppression of
the Shafranov shift by a properly shaped toroidal rotation proﬁle was reported
in Ref. [17].

6. Conclusions

We have constructed exact solutions of the equation describing the MHD
equilibrium states of an axisymmetric magnetically conﬁned plasma with incom-
ku, where S = d/du [̺(dΦ/du)2], corresponding
pressible ﬂows [Eq. (4)] for S =
to ﬂows of arbitrary direction. The solutions are based on the form (7) which is
convenient for applying boundary conditions associated with either unbounded
plasmas or bounded ones. For k = 0 the solutions are expressed in terms of
Kummer functions [(Eqs. (14) and (16) for unbounded plasmas; (19) and (20)
for bounded ones] while for k
= 0 they are expressed in terms of Airy functions
[Eq. (23)].

−

Solution (23) has then been employed to study a tokamak conﬁguration of
arbitrary aspect ratio being contained within a perfectly conducting boundary of
rectangular cross-section and toroidal current density proﬁle which can be peaked
on the magnetic axis and vanish on the boundary. In this case it turns out that
the Shafranov shift is a decreasing function of k which can vanish for a positive
value k = kc, with kc being larger the smaller the aspect ratio of the conﬁguration
is. These results demonstrate that the shape of the density and the electric ﬁeld
proﬁles associated with ﬂow and their variation perpendicular to the magnetic
surfaces can result in a strong variation of the Shafranov shift.

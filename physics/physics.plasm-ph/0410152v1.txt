Analysis of the Drift Instability Growth
Rates in Non-ideal Inhomogeneous Dusty
Plasmas

C. Cereceda, J. Puerta, P. Mart´ın and E. Castro

February 20, 2014

Abstract

In this paper we introduce an algebraic form of the dispersion relation for a non
ideal inhomogeneous dusty plasma in order to improve drastically the calculation of
the drift instability growth rate. This method makes use of the multipole approx-
imation of the Z dispersion function, previously published, and valid for the entire
range. A careful analysis of the solutions spectra of this kind of polynomial equation
permits us to calculate easily the growth rate of the drift instability for the ion-dust
and dust acoustic mode. The value of the parallel to magnetic ﬁeld wavelength for
which the instability reaches the maximal value is carefully localized and discussed.
The unstable dust-ion and dust acoustic mode are discriminated and analyzed in
function of the density gradient, Te/Ti - ratio, and dust grain radius.

1 Introduction

Plasma inhomogeneities across the magnetic ﬁeld in the presence of ﬁnite - size charged
grains causes a wide class of instabilities of an inhomogeneous dusty plasma called gradient
instabilities. Such instabilities can be studied in the approximation on magnetic ﬁeld
where we have parallel straight ﬁeld lines in order to simplify our treatment. We look
for instabilities in the very low frequency regime where a new spectrum instabilities and
waves appear, induced by the dust collective dynamics: Dust - Acoustic - Waves (DAWs),
Dust - Ion - Acoustic - Waves (DIAWs), etc. The frequency of DAWs are around 10 Hz

as determined in the laboratory and lower in astrophysical plasmas [1,2]. In the case that
grains are in the micron range we expect a non - ideal behavior due to the fact that the
particulate are highly charged and intermolecular forces could play certainly an important
role. In order to discuss this problem we compare the ideal properties with the simple
hard - core model and in a next work we will use a better model by means of of the square
- well model and the Pad´e rational approximant to the equation of state [3] for hard -
sphere gas, that in our knowledge is more realistic as the simple application of the Van
der Waals equation of state [4]. In this paper we show an analysis of the electrostatic
waves and instabilities growth rates in a weakly non - ideal magnetized dusty plasma with
density and temperature gradients, ignoring charge ﬂuctuation. As introduced before, the
non - ideal behavior is characterized by the hardcore model deﬁned by

p = nT (1 + bon),

or in similar manner by the square - well model given by the Ree and Hoover expression
[5 ].

2 Theoretical Model

In this paper we introduce a new numerical treatment in combination with a more realistic
formulation of the equation of state to simulate weak non ideal eﬀects in order to analyze
inhomogeneous Vlasov - Dusty Plasma systems where a linearized dispersion relation
ωc), enough energy can be
is obtained. Due to the lower frequency range (ω, kzvT ≪
transferred from the particle to the wave and instabilities can be generated. In order to
get an adequate linear dispersion relation with a magnetic ﬁeld given by B = B0ˆk for
Maxwellian multi-species plasmas (electron, ion and dust), we introduce our well known
and very accurate multipolar approximation [6] for the Z dispersion function.
In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld we have the distribution function of the species α,
solution for the kinetic equation

in the time dependent following form[7,8]

Now, using those results and assuming that ω

In the non ideal case (dust) we introduce a relation that in principle express the non ideal
behavior of the system in terms of the pressure in the form

p = n0

dTd(1 + bdn0

given by the hard-core model. This model is taken for simplicity. A better model, as
mentioned before, will be introduced in a future work. Now, following deﬁnitions are also

Those relations are very convenient by writing the full dispersion relation[4]. In fact we
have

for the non-ideal case. For the ideal one, we use the well known relation p0j = n0jTj, and
in a similar way we get

where j = i, e. Two special cases can be worked out:
A) Density gradient equal to zero

n0j = 0, that means, Lpj = LTj .

∇

B) Temperature gradient equal to zero
Further we can introduce following relations in order to express dielectric susceptibilities
in a suitable forms

Tj = 0, that means, Lpj = Lnj.

easy to solve and with high accuracy to ﬁnd roots of the numerator. An analysis of these

which represent the growth rate instabilities.

3 Results and Conclusions

The quasi-neutrality equation for dusty plasmas can be approached by a simpliﬁed one
due to the high state of charge of the dust grains

noi = ZDnod + noe ≃

ZDnod

and the electron susceptibility can be neglected in the dispersion relation. The range
of the main parameters in the study of the low frequency oscillation of dust grains is
established by the approximations that conduced to the simpliﬁed dispersion relation

a new intermediate instability region which can reach a maximum for denser plasmas

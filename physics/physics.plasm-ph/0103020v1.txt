BGK Electron Solitary Waves Reexamined

This paper reexamines the physical roles of trapped and passing electrons in electron Bernstein-
Greene-Kruskal (BGK) solitary waves, also called the BGK phase space electron holes (EH). It is
shown that the charge density variation in the vicinity of the solitary potential is a net balance of
the negative charge from trapped electrons and positive charge due to the decrease of the passing
electron density. A BGK EH consists of electron density enhancements as well as a density depletion,
instead of only the density depletion as previously thought. The shielding of the positive core is
not a thermal screening by the ambient plasma, but achieved by trapped electrons oscillating inside
the potential energy trough. The total charge of a BGK EH is therefore zero. Two separated EHs
do not interact and the concept of negative mass is not needed. These features are independent
of the strength of the nonlinearity. BGK EHs do not require thermal screening, and their size is
thus not restricted to be greater than the Debye length λD. Our analysis predicts that BGK EHs
smaller than λD can exist. A width(δ)-amplitude(ψ) relation of an inequality form is obtained for

In 1957, Bernstein, Greene and Kruskal [1] solved the
one-dimensional, time-independent Vlasov-Poisson equa-
tions and obtained the general solutions for electrostatic
nonlinear traveling waves,
including solitary potential
pulses. Their derivation emphasized the special role
played by the particles trapped in the potential energy
troughs. They demonstrated mathematically that one
could construct waves of arbitrary shapes by assigning
the distribution of trapped particles suitable for the de-
sired wave form.

In 1967, Roberts and Berk [2] provided a quasi-particle
picture for the electron phase space holes (EH) based
on the results of a numerical experiment on two-stream
instability. They solved the time-dependent Vlasov-
Poisson equations using the “water-bag” model in which
the evolution of electron phase-space boundaries between
f = 0 and f = 1 was followed, where f is the electron
phase space density with values either 0 or 1. They in-
terpreted the elliptical empty (f = 0) region associated
with a positive charge observed in the late stage of the
nonlinear development as a BGK EH. In order to ex-
plain the coalescence of neighboring EHs, a negative ef-
fective mass was assigned to each EH to compensate for
the Coulomb repulsion of two positive EHs. Thus, they
suggested a quasi-particle picture that BGK EHs have
positive charge and negative mass. This picture is in use
even today to interpret results in computer simulations
of EH disruptions due to ion motion [3], and to model
the mutual interaction of electrostatic solitary waves in
space plasma [4].

It was not until 1979 that BGK EHs were experimen-
tally realized by the Risø laboratory experiments [5,6].
By applying large amplitude potential pulses in a plasma-

loaded wave guide, solitary potential pulses were excited,
including EHs and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) solitons [7].
Investigations of the mutual interaction of EHs showed
that two EHs close to each other would coalesce if they
have almost equal velocity and they would pass through
each other if their relative velocity was large [5]. The
coalescence was interpreted in terms of the positive EH
picture derived earlier [5,6].

The analytical work that followed the Risø experi-
ments mainly focused on constructing solutions and ob-
taining the corresponding width-amplitude relations to
facilitate the comparison between BGK EHs and KdV
solitons [8–10]. In addressing the quasi-particle picture
of EHs, Schamel [9] concluded that EHs were positively
charged, screened by the ambient electrons over many
Debye lengths (λD), and had negative mass [9]. This
conclusion supports the positive EH picture previously
obtained from the numerical experiments [2,11] and that
the minimum size of EHs of several λD is a consequence
of thermal screening by the ambient electrons.

Maxwellian ambient electron distribution and for sev-
eral kinds of solitary potential proﬁles. He restricted
his study to BGK EHs with phase space density zero in
a hole center and the results showed that the potential
width increases with increasing amplitude. This behav-
ior is diﬀerent from that of the KdV solitons whose width
decreases with increasing amplitude. He also numerically
simulated the temporal evolution of the EHs for diﬀerent
Mach numbers to study the EH stability and found that
EHs are quasi-stable for Mach numbers less than 2. One
of the main conclusions that Turikov made was that EHs

are purely kinetic nonlinear objects in which trapped par-
ticles play an important role, but exactly what physical
role trapped particles played was not addressed.

Space-borne experiments now show that electrostatic
solitary waves (ESW) are ubiquitous in Earth’s magne-
tospheric boundaries, shock, geomagnetic tail and auro-
ral ionosphere [12–19]. While detailed properties of these
solitary waves are continuously being studied, it has been
shown that in a number of cases the ESWs have features
that are consistent with BGK electron [20] and ion [21]
mode solitary waves. A statistical study by FAST satel-
lite observations [16,17] in the auroral ionosphere has re-
vealed that solitary pulses with a positive potential typ-
ically have a Gaussian half width ranging from less than
one λD to several λD with a mean of 1.80λD and a stan-
dard deviation of 1.13λD. However, the statistical anal-
ysis strongly favored large amplitude pulses [16,17] and
smaller EHs if they existed were not sampled. This ques-
tion of how small EHs can be is an important issue asso-
ciated with how a collisionless plasma supports nonlinear
waves and needs to be further investigated.

To examine the physical roles played by trapped and
passing electrons, we start ﬁrst with simple physical ar-
guments and then perform analytical calculations using
the same formulation used by Turikov [8], except we relax
the restriction of empty-centered EHs and obtain a more
general width-amplitude relation. The number density
proﬁles of trapped and passing electrons are calculated
to show that the negative charge density at the ﬂank
of the EH comes exclusively from trapped electrons. It
is argued that the BGK EH as a physical entity con-
sists of a density enhanced region and a depletion region,
and the total charge of the EH is zero. The screening of
the positive core is achieved by trapped electrons oscil-
lating between their turning points, and not the thermal
screening by the ambient electrons as previously thought.
There does not exist a minimum size for BGK EHs based
on Debye shielding. In addition, two separated EHs do
not interact and the concept of negative mass is not
needed. These features are shown to be independent of
the strength of the nonlinearity deﬁned by the amplitude
of the potential.

We ﬁrst discuss heuristically the behavior of electrons
in the vicinity of a potential pulse. Figures 1(a)-1(c)
show the general form of a positive solitary potential
pulse (φ(x)), the corresponding bipolar electric ﬁeld (E =
∂2φ/∂x2).

The charge density is positive at the core, negative at the
boundary, and zero outside the solitary potential. Figure
1(d) shows the potential energy trough with an electron
passing by (open circle) and a trapped electron (solid cir-
cle) at its turning point. Consider the phase space tra-
jectories of electrons passing by the potential and those
that are trapped in the potential shown in Figure 1(e).

The dashed line marked by electrons with zero total en-
ergy is the boundary of the trapping region inside which
electrons are trapped and outside which electrons are un-
trapped. The total energy, w = m
eφ, is a constant
of motion. A passing electron (w > 0) moves with a
constant velocity outside the potential and the speed in-
creases when it encounters the potential pulse and then
decreases back to its original value as it moves away. A
trapped electron (w < 0) bounces back and forth between
its two turning points in the potential. Since there is no
source or sink for the particles, the density is inversely
proportional to the velocity. We can thus deduce that the
density of passing electrons is constant outside and be-
comes smaller as φ increases. No excess negative charge
results from the passing electrons. On the other hand,
trapped electrons have density maxima at their turning
points, and so must be responsible for the excess nega-
tive charge. The charge density variation (Figure 1(c))
needed to be self-consistent with the solitary potential
pulse is thus a net balance of the negative charge from
trapped electrons and the positive charge due to the den-
sity decrease of passing electrons since the ion density is
assumed uniform. From this simple picture, one can see
that in BGK solitary waves it is the trapped electrons
traveling with the solitary potential that screen out the
positive core. Our picture is diﬀerent from the picture of
a positive object in a plasma whose screening is achieved
by the thermal motion of the plasma (Debye shielding).
The entire trapping region that consists of the total
electron density enhancement at the ﬂanks and deple-
tion at the core is a physical entity produced by the self-
consistent interaction between the plasma particles and
the solitary potential pulse. This deﬁnes the physical
identity of one BGK EH. The total charge of the entire
trapping region is zero, and therefore it follows that two
separated BGK EHs do not interact and the concept of
negative mass is not needed.

We now use the approach formulated by BGK [1] to
quantify the above arguments and in addition demon-

The ﬁrst term on the RHS of Eq. 8 has been obtained
numerically and the second term analytically by Turikov

[8] except for the diﬀerence of an overall factor 2 because
he deﬁned only half of the phase space density for energy
w as ftr(w). Turikov did not explore the details of ftr
nor did he calculate the contributions from trapped and
passing electrons to macroscopic quantities, such as the
charge density, associated with EHs. As shown below, we
have relaxed the restriction to empty-centered EHs and
taken further steps to unfold the information contained
in ftr with emphasis on understanding how a collisionless
plasma kinetically supports solitary wave solutions.

the equal sign in inequalities 9 and 10. We plot the

allowed ψ and δ for the range of values shown. For a

This width-amplitude relation is dramatically diﬀerent
from that of KdV solitons whose width-amplitude rela-
tion is a one-to-one mapping. There does not exist a
minimum size for BGK EHs, and the size need not to be
several λD [22,9], since one can always adjust ψ so that
the RHS of 10 is smaller than the δ that’s picked up. We
will come back to this issue later in the paper.

We plot np(5, 4.4, x) and ntr(5, 4.4, x), and the corre-

Figure 2 and is an extremely nonlinear case. One can see
that the total charge density perturbation goes

25% positive, corresponding respectively
negative and
to electron density enhancement and depletion. With
similar format, Figure 5 plots a case with same δ and
ψ = 1 to illustrate the change in np, ntr, and ρ of an EH
with equal width but smaller amplitude. By locating this
case in Figure 2, one notices that farther away from the
ftr(w =

charge density perturbation only increases to 5% positive
and 2% negative.

These examples demonstrate how trapped electrons
produce negative charge density perturbations and pass-
ing electrons positive charge density perturbations owing
to the decrease in their number density. It is always true
0, since the number density cannot be nega-
that ntr ≥
tive, and therefore trapped electrons always contribute to
negative charge density regardless of the strength of the
nonlinearity. This result disagrees with the picture that
the positive core is due to a deﬁcit of deeply trapped elec-
trons, and that this positive core is screened out by the
ambient electrons [9]. It is also diﬀerent from the conclu-
sion that the trapped electrons are screened out by the
resonant or nonresonant passing electrons depending on
the EH velocity in [22].

We now return to the issue of minimum size of EHs.
From the illustrations of Figures 3-5, one sees that the
trapped electrons have to distribute and oscillate in such
a way to result in the desired negative charge at the ﬂanks
to shield out the positive core. The entire solitary object
is a self-consistent and self-sustained object with zero to-
tal charge and does not require thermal screening. Thus,
the size of EHs are not restricted to be greater than λD.
The charge density variations (ρ) in Figures 4 and 5
suggest that the maximum excursion of ρ is proportional
to ψ for ﬁxed δ, as M ax(ρ) decreases from 25% to 5%
when ψ varies from 5 to 1. This relation can be quantiﬁed
in the following way:

which shows that when δ is ﬁxed, ρ(x = 0) varies lin-
early with ψ from 0 to ψ0/δ2, where ψ0 is such that
ftr(ψ0, δ, w =
ψ0) = 0 (the curve in Figure 2). Eq.
13 although obtained from a particular case of a Gaus-
sian potential is actually a general relation that holds
for bell-shaped potentials. We can examine the gener-
ality of Eq. 13 by a dimensional analysis:
since the
potential amplitude and width are the only two char-
acteristic scales involved in the second spatial derivative
of the potential, the maximum excursion of the charge
density (that is

in a manner faster than √ψ in order to meet the physi-
cal requirement that M ax(ρ) goes to zero with ψ. This
general width-amplitude relation that we obtained for
empty-centered EHs is independent of the speciﬁc func-
tional form of the solitary potential and is consistent with
what Turikov [8] obtained for two special proﬁles of po-

tentials, sech

(x/δ).

In summary, we obtained the trapped electron dis-
tribution function for a Gaussian potential and a
Maxwellian passing electron distribution following the
BGK approach, and showed that the charge density vari-
ation is the net balance of the negative charge produced
by trapped electrons and the positive charge density pro-
duced by a depletion of passing electrons inside the soli-
tary potential. It is not the thermal screening from the
ambient electrons that shields out the positive core of
the EH, but the oscillations of trapped electrons in be-
tween their turning points that result in the excess neg-
ative charge. We showed that a BGK EH consists of an
electron density enhanced region and depletion region,
and this means that the total charge for a BGK EH is
zero. It thus follows that two separated EHs do not in-
teract and the concept of negative mass is not needed. It
also indicates that there does not exist a minimum size
for BGK EHs. These features are independent of the
particular choice of potential proﬁle and passing electron
distribution, and also independent of the strength of non-
linearity. The restriction to empty-centered EHs which
was used previously is relaxed to obtain a more general
width-amplitude relation that is not a one-to-one map-
ping but of an inequality form. The maximum charge
density excursion is shown to be proportional to ψ and
inversely proportional to δ, and approaches a constant
1. It is also argued that for BGK EHs that are

In the above calculation, the EHs do not have relative

this does not restrict us to non-moving EHs, since the

The inclusion of a ﬁnite EH velocity with respect to the

the partition between the two directions of the velocity of
passing electrons, and will not alter the above conclusions
as long as the BGK solutions remain valid, that is, before
any instability sets in.

Our result indicates that there is no long range inter-
action between BGK EHs. Two EHs interact only when

they are in contact. The only factor that can bring two
separated EHs closer to each other is their relative veloc-
ity. A system with multiple EHs will not evolve into a
state with only one single EH, if the EHs are separated
and move with equal velocity or if the faster EH moves
in front of the slower ones.

Finally, note that the arguments and results we ob-
tained for BGK electron solitary waves can be analo-
gously applied to BGK ion solitary waves.

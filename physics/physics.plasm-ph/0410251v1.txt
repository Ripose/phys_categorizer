Abstract

Quantum Zakharov equations are obtained to describe the nonlinear interaction between quan-

tum Langmuir waves and quantum ion-acoustic waves. These quantum Zakharov equations are

applied to two model cases, namely the four-wave interaction and the decay instability.

In the

case of the four-wave instability, suﬃciently large quantum eﬀects tend to suppress the instability.

For the decay instability, the quantum Zakharov equations lead to results similar to those of the

classical decay instability except for quantum correction terms in the dispersion relations. Some

considerations regarding the nonlinear aspects of the quantum Zakharov equations are also oﬀered.

INTRODUCTION

The importance of quantum eﬀects in ultra-small electronic devices,1 in dense astro-

physical plasma systems2 and in laser plasmas3 have produced an increasing interest on

the investigation of the quantum counterpart of some of the classical plasma physics phe-

nomena. For instance, quantum plasma echoes,4 the expansion of a quantum electron gas

into vacuum,5 the quantum two and three stream instabilities6 and the quantum Landau

damping7 have been the subject of recent investigations. Also, quantum methods like the

Wigner-Moyal transform have been used in the treatment of the Landau damping of classical

partially incoherent Langmuir waves.8 Quantum models like the Schr¨odinger-Poisson system

have also been used, through the correspondence principle, for the numerical simulation of

the Vlasov-Poisson system.9

In this context, a mathematical formulation, based on the quantum hydrodynamical

model for charged particle systems,10,11 was introduced to study the quantum version of

the low frequency ion-acoustic waves.12 In micro-electronics, the quantum hydrodynamical

model describes13 negative diﬀerential resistance associated to resonant tunnelling diodes.

It can also model ultra-small high–electron–mobility transistors.14 The quantum hydrody-

namical model for charged particle systems was also successfully used for the description of

quantum dissipation,15 under the same closure hypothesis as that adopted by Manfredi and

Haas.11 In the case of quantum ion-acoustic waves,12 several features of pure quantum origin

were observed for the linear, weakly nonlinear and fully nonlinear waves. The linear quan-

tum ion-acoustic waves are described by a dispersion relation which tends to the classical

dispersion relation as quantum eﬀects goes to zero, in accordance with the correspondence

principle. The weakly nonlinear quantum ion-acoustic waves are described by a modiﬁed

Korteweg-de Vries equation depending on a scaled ¯h parameter. Finally, the fully nonlin-

ear quantum ion-acoustic waves can have a coherent, periodic pattern, not present in the

classical case. This points to the intrinsically more reversible features of quantum plasmas,

as seen for instance in quantum echoes4 and coherent patterns in the quantum two stream

instabilities6.

The purpose of the present paper is to continue this investigation by studying the non-

linear coupling between the quantum ion-acoustic waves and the quantum Langmuir waves.

At the classical level, a set of coupled nonlinear wave equations describing the interaction

2

between high frequency Langmuir waves and low frequency ion-acoustic waves was ﬁrst de-

rived by Zakharov.16 Since then, this system have been the subject of a large number of

studies.17 In one-dimension, the Zakharov equations can be written (in normalized units) as

where E is the envelope of the high frequency electric ﬁeld and n is the plasma density

measured from its equilibrium value. The system (1-2) can be derived from a hydrodynamic

description of the plasma17,18 by distinguishing two diﬀerent time scales, the slow time scale

of the ions and the fast time scale of the electrons. The low mobility of the ions as compared

to that of the electrons justiﬁes this kind of treatment. Since the Landau damping of the

Langmuir waves is neglected in the ﬂuid description, the model (1-2) is restricted by the

condition k

kD, where k is the wavenumber and kD is the Debye wavenumber. Also, a

≪

weak turbulence condition is to be satisﬁed.17

In this paper, modiﬁed Zakharov equations are obtained by use of a quantum ﬂuid ap-

proach. Speciﬁcally, we assume a two species, one-dimensional quantum plasma in the

electrostatic approximation. Pressure eﬀects are neglected for the ions whereas the elec-

trons are described by an isothermal equation of state. Contrary to the quantum degenerate

case,12 the present model is more suitable to investigate the classical limit ¯h

0.We do not

→

include quantum statistical eﬀects in the present investigation, and therefore, only quantum

diﬀraction eﬀects, responsible e.g. for tunnelling, are taken into account.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we write the quantum hydrodynamic

model for a two-species plasma and derive the Langmuir mode for quantum plasmas. In

Section III, we obtain the quantum Zakharov system through a procedure similar to the

classical one where a two-time scale formalism is used. In Section IV we study the inﬂuence

of quantum eﬀects in two relevant parametric instabilities: the decay instability and the

four-wave instability. Section VI is devoted to a preliminary discussion of the nonlinear

aspects of the problem and some of the remaining open questions. Section V is reserved to

the conclusions.

II. QUANTUM LANGMUIR WAVES

Before considering the nonlinear coupling between ion-acoustic and Langmuir waves, we

examine the linear stability analysis of the Langmuir waves in the quantum regime.19 For

this purpose we consider a one-dimensional quantum system, composed of electrons and

singly charged ions. The quantum hydrodynamic equations in this case become12

where E is the electric ﬁeld, Pe is the electron pressure, and ne, ni, ue, ui, me and mi represent

the density, ﬂuid velocity and mass of electrons (e) and ions (i), respectively. In addition, ε0

and ¯h are the vacuum dielectric and the scaled Planck’s constants. Since we are interested

in high frequency waves, the ion density ni can be assumed constant, at this stage. The

pressure Pe is obtained from an equation of state for the electrons, which basically depends

on the thermodynamic properties of the system. In the present investigation, we consider

the isothermal equation of state Pe = κBneTe, where Te is the electrons’ temperature and κB

is the Boltzmann’s constant. In view of their large mass, ions are treated classically. Also,

in a ﬁrst approximation, we consider cold, zero temperature ions. The Bohm potential term
proportional to ¯h2 in (5) is responsible for negative diﬀerential resistance in semiconductor

devices13 and is associated to tunnelling.

Linearization of the electron equations (3), (5) and (7) around the homogeneous equilib-

rium ne = ni = n0, ue = 0 and E = 0 produces the following dispersion relation:

In Eq. (8), ω is the wave frequency, k is the wavenumber, ωe = (n0e2/meε0)1/2 is the electron
plasma frequency and ve = (κBTe/me)1/2 is the electron thermal velocity. Notice that both

classical and quantum modes can be obtained from Eq. (8). In fact, the classical limit ¯h

ω is always real, and instability (or damping) of this wave cannot be observed. The main

purpose of this paper is to obtain a model describing the exchange of energy between the

quantum Langmuir modes shown above and the recently found quantum ion-acoustic plasma

modes.12

III. QUANTUM ZAKHAROV EQUATIONS

In order to obtain the set of equations describing the nonlinear interaction between Lang-

muir waves and ion-acoustic waves, in the quantum regime, we follow the derivation orig-

inally made by Zakharov.16 A general discussion of the validity of the Zakharov equations

can be found in the review paper by Thornhill and ter Haar.17

We ﬁrst separate all ﬂuid variables into high frequency (subscript h) and low frequency

(subscript l) components,

ne(x, t) = n0 + nl(x, t) + nh(x, t) ,

ni(x, t) = n0 + nl(x, t) ,

ue(x, t) = ul(x, t) + uh(x, t) ,

ui(x, t) = ul(x, t) ,

E(x, t) = El(x, t) + Eh(x, t) .

Notice that the high frequency portions of the ion quantities [Eqs.

(10) and (12)] were

ignored due to the large ion mass. Also, from the very beginning we assume that departures
from the quasi-neutral regime (ni ≈
components of the electrons motion. The high frequency term of the electric ﬁeld can also

where ˜E(x, t) is the slowly varying envelope of the high frequency term and c.c. refer to

complex conjugate. Using the high frequency components of Eqs. (3-7), we obtain, by the

same procedure used in the classical case,17

We next proceed with the derivation of the equation for the low frequency part, nl, of

get a set of equations describing the low frequency part of the electron continuity equation,

The quantum parameter H given in (22) expresses the ratio between the ion plasmon energy

and the electron thermal energy. This is to be compared with the dimensionless parameter

characterizing quantum eﬀects in the two-stream quantum instability,6 given by the ratio

between electron plasmon and thermal energies. Here, the presence of ion-acoustic modes

forces the appearance of ionic (inertia) parameters. Notice that for dense plasmas,2 with
1032 m−3 and temperature about 105

particle density about 1025

107 K, the parameter H

−

−

is not irrelevant at all. For a completely ionized hydrogen plasma in these ranges of densities
and temperatures, H typically goes from negligible values of order 10−5 up to values of order

unity. The presence of large values of H points to the possible experimental manifestation of

quantum eﬀects in the coupling between Langmuir and ion-acoustic modes in dense plasmas,

particularly in astrophysical plasmas.

In the next section, the model (23-24) is used to investigate two parametric instabilities

extensively studied in classical plasmas: the decay instability and the four-wave interaction.

IV. PARAMETRIC INSTABILITIES

A. Decay instability

Following strictly the treatment for the classical decay instability,17 consider the proposal

now for the quantum Zakharov equations (23-24), where E1(t) and n1(t) are ﬁrst-order

quantities, and

E = E0ei(k0x−ω0t) + E1(t)ei(k1x−ω1t) ,

Ω2 = K 2 + H 2K 4 .

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

Notice that Eq. (29) is identical to the quantum dispersion relation obtained by Haas et

al.12 (Section V) except for the value of H which, due to the use of a quantum equation of

state, has a diﬀerent deﬁnition there.

Also, there are the usual matching conditions

k0 = k1 + K , ω0 = ω1 + Ω ,

(30)

7

corresponding to momentum and energy conservation respectively. These conditions de-

scribe the decay of one quantum Langmuir wave, with dispersion relation (27), into other

quantum Langmuir wave, with dispersion relation (28), and a quantum ion-acoustic wave,

with dispersion relation (29).

Linearizing the quantum Zakharov equations, we obtain

In all situations, the discriminant20 of the cubic equation (36) is positive and there are

bilities. The only diﬀerences remain in the dispersion relations (27-29), for the quantum

Langmuir and ion-acoustic modes. The quantum dispersion relations, however, produces a

solution E(x, t) = E0 exp(

This implies the relation

The last equation can be found also from the dispersion relation for quantum Langmuir

modes [equation (8)] taking ωe = 0 and the recalling of variables. In fact, ωe is absorbed in

the electric ﬁeld through (14). In conclusion, (41) shows a quantum Langmuir mode.

When combined, Eqs. (24), (41-42) and the complex conjugate of (43) give the following

The dispersion relation (44) is a fourth order polynomial in ω that, in general, can only

be analyzed numerically. However, the simplest case ω0 = k0 = 0 can be investigated

analytically. For a purely growing instability ω = iγ the dispersion relation (44) becomes

This is in agreement with the overall stabilization that quantum diﬀraction eﬀects produce

in high density plasmas.6,7 In fact, for suﬃciently large H there is no transfer of energy from

the original quantum Langmuir mode to the two new quantum Langmuir modes and to the

quantum ion-acoustic mode.

Let us consider in more detail the potentially unstable mode described by the positive root

in (49). In Fig. 2, we show γ2 versus k2 for H = 0, H = 0.5 and H = 0.9, with E0 = 0.5. The
instability region (γ2 > 0) in k-space becomes narrower for bigger H. Also, the maximum γ2

becomes smaller the larger the quantum eﬀects. This latter result is analytically supported

by an expansion of the positive root of Eq. (49). The wavenumber for maximum growth

rate, kmax can be calculated, in a O(k5) approximation, by expanding Eq. (49) up to ﬁfth

order in k. This perturbation analysis is interesting since dγ/dk = 0 is not soluble in closed

form if we use the exact expression for (49). The result of the expansion procedure is shown

in Fig. 3, where the wavenumber kmax for maximum growth rate when E0 = 0.5 is shown as

a function of H. (Notice the extended domain of the function, beyond the reasonable limit

of H ∼= 1.) Using this kmax we obtain a somewhat complicated expression which can be used
to calculate the associated growth rate γ. Using a computer algebra program, we can easily

obtain γmax = E2

0 (1

equation showing that quantum eﬀects produce stabilization. The approximations adopted

are justiﬁed in view of our assumptions of long wavelengths and weak turbulence (small

electric ﬁeld amplitudes). For dense astrophysical plasmas with H

both classical and quantum cases. Also, the plots of Ds and D2 branches touch each other at

raise with H, implying reduction of the interval in k where instability settles down. This

can be checked against the corresponding ﬁgures in the second and third columns, where a

contraction of the unstable interval is clearly seen.

Denote the unstable interval in k by Ik = (ka, kb). For higher pump energy E0, the third

column of Fig. 4 shows an overall contraction of Ik. This results from the gradual shift of ka

to the right and kb to the left, due to the quantum eﬀects. For the relevant range of values

1, less severe attenuations occur for the maximum growth rate, compared to those

found for the unstable interval in k. Thus, the numerical results show that the quantum

eﬀect inhibits the spreading of energy among diﬀerent modes. In fact, assume that for a
speciﬁc k, NI = (kb −
at the beginning of the process. Then, the contraction of Ik implies that the Langmuir

ka)/k represents a ﬁrst estimation for the number of active modes

ﬂuctuations in quantum plasmas might represent more coherent conﬁgurations, i.e., having

less eﬀective modes when compared to the corresponding classical situation, an issue to be

V. NONLINEAR ANALYSIS AND OPEN QUESTIONS

An important regime of the classical Zakharov equations concerns its static limit. In this

case, the classical Zakharov system do possess soliton solutions described by a nonlinear

Sch¨odinger equation.17 The procedure for the static limit of the quantum Zakharov equations

considers the approximation ∂2n/∂t2

0 in (24). This gives immediately

In the classical limit H

0, the right-hand side of Eq. (53) vanishes and we recover the

→

nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation with its soliton solutions. In the quantum case, however,

equations (52-53) form a coupled, nonlinear system. We have not been able to ﬁnd localized,

analytical solutions for this system. In fact, the usual reduction procedure of searching for

solutions in the form

E = F (x

Mt) exp(i[k(x

ut) + δ]) , n = G(x

Mt) ,

for real F , G, k, M, u and δ produces a complicated fourth-order system of coupled, nonlinear

equations. The existence of soliton solutions for this system remains an open question. It

seems that a numerical analysis could help in this respect but we believe that this issue

should be more appropriately treated in a future work.

Another avenue in nonlinear studies of the quantum Zakharov equation concerns its

simultaneous semiclassical and static limit. Substituting (52) into (53) and retaining only

terms up to O(H 2) produces the decoupled equation

Equation (55) can be used to study perturbations of the classical NLS soliton solutions.

The terms proportional to H 2, in Eq. (55), will probably modify the dispersion-nonlinearity

equilibrium, which is the ultimate responsible for the soliton existence.

More formal aspects of the Zakharov equations have to do with its variational formulation

and the associated Noether currents.21 In particular the quantum Zakharov equations pre-

serve the number of plasmons

Notice the extra contribution proportional to H 2 to the plasmons current.The conservation

law (56) comes from the imaginary part of (23) and hence contains no contribution from

n. A proper formulation of the remaining conservation laws (momentum and energy) of

the system is an open question to be tackled, preferably in accordance with symmetry

principles of an associated action functional. Other important issues concern the search

for coherent solutions of the quantum Zakharov equations, namely quantum solitons and

quantum cavitons.

Still another issue related to the nonlinear analysis of Eqs. (23-24) concerns thermaliza-

tion and recurrence. For periodic boundary conditions, the classical NLS does not exhibit

thermalization and, therefore, is generically recurrent.22,23 The classical procedure to address

such questions is based on estimations for the number of active modes NA, from the Rayleigh

quotient. An upper bound estimation for this number is provided by two invariants: the

number of plasmons and a momentum–like invariant which, in our case, is not yet known.

For classical regimes, numerical simulations show that the conclusions can, in general, be

extended to the non-integrable Zakharov system, when considered as a perturbation of the

NLS regime.24 In fact, it has been shown that, at least for some period of time, the constancy

of the momentum-like quantity is approximately satisﬁed. Moreover, numerical simulations
show that the elementary estimation presented in the last section, i.e., NA ≈
quite good results when applied to the full Zakharov equations. Under this viewpoint, the

NI, can yield

contraction of the k-unstable interval due to H

= 0, veriﬁed in subsection (IV B), suggests

that the distribution of energy is less intense in quantum plasmas when compared with the

classical case. Therefore, quantum eﬀect would favor recurrence in Langmuir modulational

regimes.

To ﬁnalize, we can derive some exact solutions for the quantum Zakharov equations (23-

24) if we consider pure ion-sound waves obtained by taking E = 0. With zero electric ﬁeld,

the density perturbation satisﬁes the undriven equation

∂2n
∂t2 −

∂2n

∂x2 + H 2 ∂4n

∂x4 = 0 .

(59)

This linear fourth-order evolution equation was investigated using the method of Lie

symmetries25 and we found time and space translation symmetries, as well as a scale symme-

try resulting from the linearity. The H 2 term breaks down the Lorentz invariance endowed

by the classical model for pure ion-sound waves, so that arbitrary waves travelling at the

14

6
ion-sound velocity can not be constructed. Nevertheless, exact solutions for Eq. (59) can be

found supposing n = ¯n(x

ct), for constant c and for ¯n a function to be determined. For

c2 > 1, corresponding to supersonic ﬂow, and disregarding an integration constant associated

−

to non-bound solutions, we get periodic solutions of the form

n = a + b cos

1

√c2

−

 

(x

(60)

where a, b and δ are numerical constants. This similarity solution is an arbitrary amplitude

solution. Notice that quantum eﬀects increase the spatial frequency of oscillations in the

reference frame of the travelling wave.

VI. CONCLUSION

We obtained a general model to analyze the coupling between Langmuir waves and ion-

acoustic waves, in a quantum setting. The model was shown to be appropriate to the

four-wave interaction and quantum eﬀects have been shown to provide stabilization of a

classically unstable mode. In the case of the decay instability, a formal similarity with the

classical case is identiﬁed, except for small diﬀerences in the dispersion relations, representing

quantum corrections. We also identiﬁed a dimensionless quantum parameter given by the

ratio of the ion plasmon and electron thermal energies. As pointed out before, this quantum

parameter may not be small, at least for dense plasmas.

The consequences of our results on todays laboratory or technological plasmas are not yet

fully assessed since, for present conditions, H

1 in these applications. However quantum

≪

eﬀects may imply important consequences in the behavior of high density astrophysical

plasmas, where H

1 is easily found. In this case, as we pointed out, quantum eﬀects cause

∼

an overall reduction in the wave-wave interaction level. Speciﬁcally and in contrast to the

classical case, the decay instability growth rate is bounded for large wavenumbers. Growth

rate reduction also occurs for the four-wave interaction. Besides, suppression is also veriﬁed

in the length of the unstable spectral range, implying spectral focusing, i.e., a restriction on

the range of possible unstable wave-numbers. This focusing eﬀect may extend to quite long

periods of time, indicating that the recurrence properties veriﬁed in the classical Zakharov

equation are enhanced by the quantum eﬀects.

A number of open questions remains to be addressed. Of course, a complete analysis of the

15

linear dispersion relation of the quantum Zakharov system have to be done. This may require

a full three-dimensional treatment, with the inclusion of electromagnetic coupling between

Langmuir and ion-acoustic modes. An additional important point are the nonlinear eﬀects,

some of them brieﬂy discussed in Section V, which may deserve a more careful scrutiny. To

conclude, the huge amount of physical and mathematical aspects already assessed in the

classical Zakharov equations certainly have quantum counterparts which ask for an equally

careful investigation.

The ground state of an externally conﬁned one-component Yukawa plasma is derived analytically.
In particular, the radial density proﬁle is computed. The results agree very well with computer
simulations on three-dimensional spherical Coulomb crystals. We conclude in presenting an exact
equation for the density distribution for a conﬁnement potential of arbitrary geometry.

INTRODUCTION

II. GROUND STATE OF A CONFINED
PLASMA

Plasmas in external trapping potentials have been at-
tracting increasing interest over the last few years in
many ﬁelds, including trapped ions, e.g.
[1, 2], dusty
[3, 4, 5] and electrons and positrons in
plasmas, e.g.
Penning traps, see e.g.
[6] for an overview. Among the
main reasons is that, in these systems, it is relatively
easy to realize strong correlation eﬀects in charged par-
ticle systems. Probably the most spectacular manifes-
tation of these eﬀects is Coulomb liquid behavior and
crystal formation which has been found in various ge-
ometries. In particular, the ion crystals and the recently
observed spherical dust crystals or “Coulomb balls” [7]
have triggered intensive new experimental and theoreti-
cal work, e.g. [8, 9, 10]. The shell structure of these crys-
tals, including details of the shell radii and the particle
distribution over the shells has been very well explained
theoretically by a simple model involving an isotropic
Yukawa-type pair repulsion and an harmonic external
conﬁnement potential [10].

Still, it remains an open question, how the average
particle distribution inside the trap looks like, if it is the
same as in the case of Coulomb interaction.
It is well
known that in a parabolic potential, particles interacting
via the Coulomb potential establish a radially constant
density proﬁle. Here, we extend this analysis to a plasma
with Yukawa interaction by solving a variational prob-
lem for the ground state density (Sec. II). Then, in Sec.
III we demonstrate that screening has a dramatic eﬀect
on the density proﬁle giving rise to a parabolic decrease
away from the trap center. There we demonstrate that
the result for the density proﬁle can be directly general-
ized to any anisotropic conﬁnement potential. While our
analysis is based on a continuous plasma model on the
mean-ﬁeld level, we ﬁnd (Sec. IV), by comparison with
molecular dynamics simulations, that the results apply
also to spherical crystals with a shell structure.

This equation has four complex and two real solutions,
only one of which is non-negative and thus constitutes the
unique proper result entering Eq. (12). In the Coulomb

which is ﬁxed by the number of particles and the con-

introduced the length scale r0 = 3
2Q2/α, which is the
stable distance of two charged particles in the absence of
p
screening [10] and which will be used below as the proper
unit for lengths, screening parameter and density. Note
that Eq. (15) holds also for a weakly screened Yukawa
plasma with κR

which holds at any point where the density is non-zero.
Also, Eq. (7) is equivalent to vanishing of the total force
on the particles separately at any space point r, cf.
Sec. III B.

Equation (7) is completely general, applying to any
pair interaction V and conﬁnement potentials of ar-
bitrary form and symmetry, see Sec. III C. Of par-
ticular interest is the case of an isotropic conﬁnement
Φ(r) = Φ(r), which leads to an isotropic density distri-

Fig. 1 shows the result for the dimensionless radius κR =

for all values of κ and N is given by a single curve.

With the result for R the constant c, which is propor-
tional to central density, can be computed from Eq. (12),
and the complete density proﬁle, Eq. (11), is found. The
results are shown in Fig. 2 for four particle numbers be-
tween N = 100 and N = 2000. One clearly recognizes
the inverted parabola which terminates in a ﬁnite density
in a discontinuity, at r = R. With increas-
value, i.e.
ing N , the density increases continuously at every space
point and, at the same time, extends to higher values R.
Thereby the density proﬁle retains its shape.

shown in the ﬁgure. For comparison, also the result for κr0 =
0.3 and N = 2000 is shown by the dashed line.

On the other hand, when the plasma screening is in-
creased, at constant N , the density proﬁle changes dra-
matically, compare the two curves for N = 2000. Increase
of κ leads to compression of the plasma: the radius R de-
creases, and the absolute value of the density increases,
most signiﬁcantly in the center. This compressional be-
havior is shown in Fig. 3, cf. the full green line showing
the ratio of the inner to outer densities of the plasma.

The dependence on κ is analyzed more in detail in
Fig. 4 below for a ﬁxed particle number N = 2000. In
the case of Coulomb interaction, κ = 0, we recover the
constant density proﬁle (14). On the other hand, in the
case of a screened potential, the density decays parabol-
ically with increasing distance from the trap center, cf.
Eq. (11). Also, the density discontinuity at r = R is soft-
ened compared to the Coulomb case, and the step height
increases.

age density at the positions of the shells is shown, for details
see discussion in Sec. IV B.

B. Force equilibrium

Besides minimizing the total energy, cf. Eq. (7), the
ground state density proﬁle can be obtained from the
condition of a local equilibrium of the total force (inter-
nal plus external ones) at each point where the density
is non-zero. On the other hand, the shape of the radial
density proﬁle and its change with variation of κ is di-
rectly related to a change of the force equilibrium. Here,
we demonstrate this for the special case of a spherically
symmetric conﬁnement potential Φ(r). The forces can
be directly derived from Eq. (8) by taking the gradient

in radial direction

Φ′(r) = F<(r) + F>(r),

(17)

−

which means that, for any spherical layer at a distance r
Φ′(r) which
from the center, the external force FΦ(r) =
acts towards the center is balanced by the internal force
due to the Yukawa repulsion between the particles. The
internal force contains two parts where F< arises from
the action of all particles inside the given layer, r′
r,
and acts outward, whereas F> results from the action of
all particles located outside r′

This force balance can be used to obtain the ground state

their dependence on κ.

with N< = nc 4πr3/3 being the particle number in the
inner region. This means, the force is repulsive and in-
creases linearly with r and exactly compensates the linear
external force FΦ(r) =

αr for all values r < R.

In the general case of ﬁnite screening the outer force
F>(r) does not vanish, cf. Eq. (18a). Since its direction
is always towards the center, the force F<(r) has to in-
crease simultaneously, in order to compensate the com-
bined eﬀect of FΦ(r) and F>(r). This eﬀect increases
continuously with increasing κ which is directly veriﬁed
by evaluating the expressions in Eq. (18a).

C. Generalization to arbitrary conﬁnement
geometry

The result for the density proﬁle in an isotropic con-
ﬁnement, Eq. (9), can be easily extended to arbitrary
geometry. For this purpose we use the text book result
that the charge density corresponding to the Yukawa po-
tential is Qδ(r)
Qκ2e−κr/r. This allows us to rewrite

IV. DENSITY PROFILE OF CONFINED
COULOMB AND YUKAWA CRYSTALS

So far we have considered the model of a continuous
density distribution n(r). On the other hand, the ground
state of a conﬁned spherically symmetric system of dis-
crete point-like charged particles is known to have a shell
structure as was demonstrated for dusty plasmas in Ref.
[7].
It is, therefore, of interest to verify if such a shell
structure can be derived from our starting equation (2)
for the total energy and to compare our results to the
radial density distribution in such Coulomb or Yukawa
balls.

A. Derivation of a shell model for a trapped ﬁnite
Yukawa plasma

The concentric shells observed in spherical trapped
Coulomb crystals have led to the proposal of simple an-
[11, 14, 15, 19]. Such a model
alytical models, cf. e.g.
for a trapped one-component plasma is trivially derived
from the total energy expression (2) by inserting for the
density the ansatz

ns(r) = ns(r) =

(22)

which describes L concentric shells of zero thickness with
L
ν=1 Nν +ζ =
Nν particles on shell ν with radius Rν and
N , where ζ denotes the number of particles in the trap
center (zero or one) [11, 15]. As a result, we obtain for
the total ground state energy of a Yukawa plasma in an
isotropic general conﬁnement potential Φ

This is essentially the Yukawa shell model of Totsuji et
al., Ref. [19] where, however, the ﬁnite size correction

factor (Nν −

term ζ are missing. In the Coulomb limit, κ

result simpliﬁes with e−κRν
1, and

we immediately recover the Coulomb shell model of Hasse
and Avilov [14] (plus the additional correction factor).

A further improvement is possible by including in-
trashell correlations [15]. The simplest model is obtained
ǫ(N )√Nν, where ǫ is a ﬁt
Nν −
by replacing Nν −
parameter close to one which allows to achieve excellent
agreement with the exact ground state [11]. An alter-
native way to include correlations was proposed by Ref.
[19].

B. Comparison with simulation results for ﬁnite
Yukawa crystals

In order to compare the density proﬁle n(r) of our
continuous model with the density of discrete spherical
Yukawa crystals, we performed molecular dynamics sim-
ulations of the ground state of a large number of Coulomb
balls, for details, see refs. [9, 10]. As an example, the nu-
merical results for a Coulomb ball with N = 2000 which
is large enough to exhibit macroscopic behavior [16, 17]
are included in Fig. 4. The symbols denote the average
particle density around each of the shells. The averag-
ing was accomplished by substituting each particle by a
small but ﬁnite sphere, so that a smooth radial density
proﬁle was obtained.

With increasing κ the crosses move towards the cen-
ter conﬁrming the compression of the Coulomb balls ob-
served before [10]. Obviously, the simulation results are
very well reproduced by the analytical density proﬁle (11)
of a continuous plasma. But there are also small discrep-
ancies in the central part which grow slowly with κ. One
reason is that, for large κ, the width of the inner shells
increases rapidly, making the comparison diﬃcult. An-
other possible reason could be the eﬀect of correlations.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In summary, we have presented a theoretical analysis
of the ground state density proﬁle of spatially conﬁned
one-component plasmas in dependence on the form of the
pair interaction. An explicit result for the density proﬁle
for an arbitrary conﬁnement potential has been derived.
In particular, for an isotropic conﬁnement, we have found
that screening of the Coulomb interaction substantially
modiﬁes the radial density distribution. In contrast to
a bare Coulomb interaction for which the density inside
a parabolic external potential is constant, for a screened
interaction, a quadratic decay away form the center is
found.

Interestingly, while our results were derived for a con-
tinuous density distribution (a macroscopic system) and
with neglect of binary correlations, our analytical results
agree very well also with ﬁrst-principle simulation re-
sults for strongly correlated Coulomb and Yukawa clus-
ters containing several thousands of particles for screen-
1. This agreement is by no means
ing paramters κr0 ≤
trivial and deserves further analysis. Further, it is very
interesting to investigate the reason for the deviations at
large values of the screening parameter, and analyze the
eﬀect of binary correlations on the density distributions
is. These questions will be subject of forthcoming work.

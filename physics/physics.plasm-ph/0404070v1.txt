Abstract

The present study is a continuation of a previous one on ”hyperel-
liptic” axisymmetric equilibria started in [Tasso and Throumoulopou-
los, Phys. Plasmas 5, 2378 (1998)]. Speciﬁcally, some equilibria with
incompressible ﬂow nonaligned with the magnetic ﬁeld and restricted
by appropriate side conditions like ”isothermal” magnetic surfaces,
”isodynamicity” or P + B2/2 constant on magnetic surfaces are found
to be reducible to elliptic integrals. The third class recovers recent
equilibria found in [Schief, Phys. Plasmas 10, 2677 (2003)]. In contrast
to ﬁeld aligned ﬂows, all solutions found here have nonzero toroidal
magnetic ﬁeld on and elliptic surfaces near the magnetic axis.

1 Introduction and basic equation

A generalized Grad-Shafranov equation has been derived in Ref. [1] (Eq. (22)
therein) to describe axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic equilibria with in-
compressible ﬂows. This equation consisting the starting point of the present
investigation is given by

where PS(ψ) is part of the pressure which depends on ψ only, ψ being the
poloidal magnetic ﬂux function. The elliptic operator ∆∗ is deﬁned by ∆∗ =

R2
and ρ(ψ) is the mass density, Φ(ψ) is the electrostatic potential, Θ/(ρR) is
M 2) + R2F ′Φ′ where I/R
the toroidal velocity component and X(ψ) = I(1
is the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld. R, φ, z are the usual cylindrical coordinates
with z corresponding to the axis of symmetry. As stated in Ref.
[1] the
surface quantities F (ψ), Φ(ψ), X(ψ), ρ(ψ) and PS(ψ) are free functions. For
each choice of this set of ﬁve functions, Eq.(1) is fully determined and can
be solved whence the boundary condition for ψ is given.

2 Side conditions

Instead of specifying the free functions mentioned above to determine Eq.(1),
it may be of physical or mathematical importance to introduce side conditions
on some physical quantities like the total pressure, the magnitude of the

isothermal magnetic surfaces in hot plasmas [1] because of the huge parallel
heat conductivity or to try to eliminate neoclassical eﬀects [2] through an
isodynamic condition. Such side conditions lead, in general, to an additional

[1] or in Ref. [2]. It turns out that, due to the assumed incompressibility of
the ﬂow, Eq.(4) as well as the side conditions considered here have quartic
R dependence on the right hand side, which together with Eq.(4) can be
expressed as follows

where x stays for R2 and ﬁve compatibility conditions for seven free functions
including the ﬁve free functions of Eq. (1). There should be no problem, in
general, to satisfy those compatibility conditions. The solutions of (13) are,
in general, hyperelliptic integrals [4], which are not related to known special
functions unless they can be reduced to elliptic integrals. This occurs, in
particular, for ﬁeld aligned ﬂows (Φ′ = 0) considered in Ref.
[1, 5]. The
purpose of this contribution is to ﬁnd other cases of elliptic reduction with
nonaligned ﬂows (Φ′
= 0). The easiest case of that kind is to annihilate the
coeﬃcient of the largest powers of x in the denominator of Eq.(13)

with h and k both diﬀerent from zero.

(P + B2/2) = function of u

Though this side condition is not as relevant to hot plasmas as the previous
cases, it is of mathematical interest since it induces a ”hidden symmetry”
in the equilibrium equations as discovered in Ref. [6], which leads to a rich
class of solutions. After calculating (P + B2/2) and setting it a function of
u, we obtain the coeﬃcients i(u), j(u) and k(u) entering condition (6) as

while as before f (u), g(u) and h(u) are still given by (7)-(9) since Eq. (5)
does not change. It turns out that, in this case, the reduction equation (14)
is identically satisﬁed, which is reminiscent of the hidden symmetry of Ref.
[6], so recovering the elliptic solutions found therein.

3 Behaviour of solutions near magnetic axis

u

−

It is instructive to analyse the properties of all possible solutions of (5) and
(6) near the magnetic axis. Focussing on (5) and (6) we employ a Cartesian
system (x, y) centred on magnetic axis, i.e. R = R(0) + x and z = z(0) + y,
and expand the u surfaces in x and y around the magnetic axis up to second
order:

u(0) = ax2 + bxy + cy2 + higher orders.

(27)

Also, we expand the ﬂux functions contained in (5) and (6) up to ﬁrst order
in u

u(0), i.e.

−
i(u) = i(0) + i′(0)(u

−

j(u) = j(0) + j′(0)(u

u(0)),

(28)
and R2 and R4 up to second order in x and y. On the basis of the zeroth, ﬁrst
and second order equations thus obtained from (5) and (6) we can determine
the coeﬃcients a, b and c of u
It turns out that b = 0 and

where γ = [i′(0)+R(0)2j′(0)+R(0)4k′(0)]/(2√2). For the cases of subsections
2 and 3 Eq.(29), on account of (21) and (26) implying k(0) < 0, means that
the magnetic surfaces near the magnetic axis are elliptical with elongation
being directed toward R. For isothermal magnetic surfaces, however, the
elongation can be either parallel to R if M 2 > 1/2 or parallel to z if M 2 < 1/2
via (12). For M 2 = 1/2 the isothermal magnetic surfaces become circular.
Also, in all three cases the ellipses become circles for ﬁeld aligned ﬂows, i.e.
the Palumbo’s solution is recovered [5, 6, 2]. This point was overlooked in
Ref.
In addition, the strength of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld on the
magnetic axis is proportional to k(0)R2(0), which vanishes for ﬁeld aligned
ﬂows or Palumbo’s solution.

[1].

4 Conclusions

In conclusion, the reduction of the ”hyperelliptic” equilibria with nonaligned
ﬂows introduced in Ref. [1] has been demonstrated for several side conditions
permitting the discovery of whole classes of magnetohydrodynamic equilibria.
All these equilibria have nonzero magnetic ﬁeld and elliptic magnetic surfaces
on magnetic axis (see Ref.
[6] for a special case). The present reduction is
based on the annihilation of the fourth and ﬁfth power under the square
root appearing in Eq. (13). Another possible reduction could be sought by
ﬁnding the conditions under which the ﬁfth order polynomial appearing in
the denominator of Eq. (13) can be factorized with a double zero leaving a
cubic polynomial under the square root. This and more details about the
equilibria demonstrated here is left to future work.

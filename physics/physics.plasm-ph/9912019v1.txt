Abstract

The distribution of the electric microﬁeld at a charged particle moving in

a two-component plasma is calculated. The theoretical approximations are

obtained via the parameter integration technique and using the screened

pair approximation for the generalized radial distribution function.

It is

shown that the two-component plasma microﬁeld distribution shows a larger

probability of high microﬁeld values than the corresponding distribution of

the commonly used OCP model. The theory is checked by quasiclassical

molecular-dynamics simulations. For the simulations a corrected Kelbg

pseudopotential has been used.

I. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this paper is the investigation of the microﬁeld distribution in a two-

component plasma at the position of a charged particle.

The determination of the distribution of the electric microﬁeld component created by

one of the subsystems separately - electron or ion - is a well studied problem (for a review

see [1]). Holtsmark [2] reduced the line shape problem to the determination of the prob-

ability distribution of perturbing ionic electric microﬁeld. In recent papers it was argued

that the electric microﬁeld low frequency part (due to the ion dynamics) also inﬂuences

the fusion rates [3] and the rates for the three-body electron-ion recombination [4] in

dense plasmas. Holtsmark’s work on the electric microﬁeld distribution was restricted to

ideal plasmas. The opposite limiting case of inﬁnite coupling strength was considered by

Mayer [5,6] within the ion sphere model. Within this model the central ion undergoes

harmonic oscillations around the center of the negatively charged ion sphere. This results

in a Gaussian approximation for electric microﬁelds at the ion position. The nonideality

of plasmas leads to quantitative corrections to Holtsmark’s result as shown by Baranger

and Mozer [7] and Iglesias [8] for the case of weakly coupled plasmas and by Iglesias et al.

[9] for the case of strongly coupled plasmas. In these papers it is shown that with increas-

ing coupling strength Γ the long tailed Holtsmark distribution is changed into the fast

decaying Gaussian approximation. Here the coupling parameter Γ = e2/kT d is deﬁned

via the electron density ne (d = [3/4πne]1/3 is the average distance of the electrons).

In the cited papers the electric microﬁeld created by one of the subsystems has been

studied by an almost total neglect of the inﬂuence of the other subsystem. A common

assumption is that the distribution of the high-frequency component (due to the electron

dynamics) is the same as that of an electron gas with uniform neutralizing background.

This is the so called model of the one component plasma (OCP). For the ion subsystem,

in a ﬁrst approximation, the electrons are assumed to move free through the plasma.

Since the electron motion is much more rapid than the ion one, the electrons are treated

2

as a smeared negative charged background. For simplicity this background charge was

assumed to be uniform in the density and not to be distorted by the ion motion. This

again is the OCP model.

A more realistic model should also take into account the variation of the background

charge density. A background charge distribution which diﬀers from a uniform distribution

results in a screening of the ion motion, the screening strength is generally frequency

dependent, e.g. it depends on the ion velocity. In a ﬁrst approximation one might neglect

the frequency dependence of the screening. Then one arrives at the model of an OCP on

a polarizable background (POCP). In the theory of microﬁelds this slightly more involved

model is used to describe the low frequency part [7,10]. However, both the OCP and the

POCP fail to describe the correlations between the electron and the ion subsystem.

To include the electron-ion correlations one has to consider the model of a two-

component plasma (TCP). This paper is adressed to the electric microﬁeld studies in

an equilibrium two-component plasma. To our knowledge the electric microﬁeld in a

TCP has been studied only by Yan and Ichimaru [11]. However, due to a couple of

ﬂaws contained in the paper of Yan and Ichimaru a further investigation is required.

For simplicity we will restrict ourselves to the case of a two-component plasma which is

anti-symmetric with respect to the charges (e

=

e+) and therefore symmetrical with

respect to the densities (n+ = ni = n

= ne). Further, the theoretical investigations are

−

−

−

carried out for arbitrary electron ion mass ratios. To simplify the numeric investigations

we simulated so far only a mass symmetrical (nonrelativistic) electron-positron plasma

with m = m+ = me. We study this - so far unrealistic - case of mass - symmetrical

plasmas in order to save computer time in particle simulations. The mass-symmetrical

model is well suited to check the quality of various analytical approximations. In addition,

the results of the simulation are also applicable to the case of an electron-hole plasma in

semiconductors.

As for the case of the OCP the microﬁeld distribution of a TCP in the weak coupling

3

regime is approximated by the Holtsmark distribution. However, coupled plasmas are

important objects in nature, laboratory experiments, and in technology [12–14].

Therefore we are interested in the modiﬁcation of the microﬁeld distribution caused

by the coupling of plasma particles. Both theoretical investigations and semiclassical

simulations are performed to study the microﬁeld distribution in two-component plasmas.

In this paper the free charges (electron and ions) are simulated by a semiclassical dy-

namics based on eﬀective potentials. The idea of the semiclassical method exploited in the

numerical part of this paper is to incorporate quantum-mechanical eﬀects (in particular

the Heisenberg and the Pauli principle) by appropriate potentials. This method was pi-

oneered by Kelbg, Dunn and Broyles, Deutsch and others [15–17]. Several investigations

were devoted to the simulation of equilibrium two-component plasmas [18–22]. Being

interested in semiclassical methods we mention explicitely the semiclassical simulations

of two-component plasmas performed by Norman and by Hansen [18,19].

Certainly, such a semiclassical approach has several limits. For example, bound states

cannot be described classically, therefore our methods are restricted to the subsystem of

the free charges. However, this is not a very serious restriction since most of the plasma

properties are determined by the subsystem of the free charges.

The semiclassical approach may be very usefull to calculate a standard macroscopic

property such as the microﬁeld distribution since it has a well deﬁned classical limit. The

advantage of such an approach is the relative simplicity of the algorithm.

The other limiting case of strong coupling Γ

1 is known so far only for the one-

≫

component plasma model. For the OCP the ion sphere model holds in the strong coupling

regime. Within this model the charge will be attracted towards the center of its oppositely

charged sphere of radius d = [3/4πne]1/3 and with average density ne. The harmonic

potential for the displacement of the center leads then to a Gaussian approximation for

the distribution of the normalized electric ﬁeld F = E/E0,OCP at the charge ,

P (F ) = (2/π)1/2(F 2/τ 3/2) exp(

F 2/2τ )

The normalizing ﬁeld strength for the OCP case should be expressed in terms of the

the Gaussian distribution Eq.(10) simpliﬁes and reads τcl = 1/(bΓ), and Eq.(10) turns

into the expression developed by Mayer [5].

However, there is no commonly accepted generalization of the ion sphere model for

the two-component plasma with charges of diﬀerent signs. Moreover we will show that

in the case of TCP there is not any analogue for the Gaussian distribution in strongly

coupled OCP.

First we mention that the Fourier transform of the Gaussian distribution for electric

microﬁeld applicable in the strong coupling OCP regime equals

On the other hand it is possible to perform exact calculations for the leading terms

in the small L expansion of the Fourier transform T (L). From the deﬁnition of T (k) Eq.

In Refs. [9] it was argued that it is necessary to incorporate the knowledge of the second

moment < ε2 > into the calculation of microﬁeld distributions in OCP. One might now try

to generalize this idea to the case of a TCP. However, as can be easily seen the coeﬃcient

in the k2 term < ε2 > diverges in the case of a TCP:

which diverges at small distances, since for a ﬂuid quantum system both gei(0)

= 0 and

gee(0)

= 0. In the classical OCP only gee(r) appears with gee(0) = 0, therefore the above

integral and < ε2 > are ﬁnite.

In contrast to what we have found Yan and Ichimaru

[11] predict a ﬁnite second moment. In Ref. [11] no derivation of their second moment

expression valid “strictly in the classical limit” [11] is given. To isolate a possible error

in the derivation of Yan and Ichimaru one may perform semiclassical calculations of the

second moment. Details of the semiclassical model are given in the next Section. We

a system of classical particles interacting via an eﬀective potential uab(r) = eaeb/r +

us,ab(r), where the short-range part of the eﬀective potential us,ab(r) cuts the short-range

divergency of the Coulomb potential. Therefore at short distances us,ab(r

The ﬁrst term in the above equation has been reported in Ref. [11], the second term has

been omitted. However, as may be easily seen this second term is divergent. It may be

expressed by an integral similar to that of Eq. (17) which diverges at the lower bound.

Thus we have established a qualitative diﬀerence between the classical OCP and the

TCP system. For the ﬁrst the second moment of the microﬁeld distribution is ﬁnite and

corresponds to the variance of the Gaussian distribution.

In contrast to the OCP case the second moment of the TCP system diverges. As a

result the TCP microﬁeld distribution does never converge to a Gaussian distribution.

We now generalize a coupling parameter technique which was used to calculate the

microﬁeld distribution of a classical OCP [8,9] to the case of a quantum TCP. Consider

with j0 being the Bessel function of order zero. We notice that the use of the screened

Coulomb potential Eq.(27) ensures the divergency of the second moment of the TCP

microﬁeld distribution. In this point our theory diﬀers essentially from the results obtained

by Yan and Ichimaru who used a potential of mean force instead of the screened Coulomb

ﬁeld [11]. Eqs.(26)-(28) constitute the so called exponential approximation (EXP) [9]. It

9

is known that in contrast to the so called adjustable parameter exponential approximation

(APEX) the EXP expression poorly agrees with MD OCP data. In the APEX [9] one

substitutes Eq. (27) by an ad hoc ansatz for E∗a(r). According to this ansatz the potential

E∗a(r) is approximated by a parametrized Debye potential where the parameter is choosen

to satisfy the second moment.

In order to get a generalized APEX expression for the

TCP one should know the second moment of the TCP microﬁeld distribution. However,

in the above consideration we have shown that the second moment of the TCP microﬁeld

distribution diverges. Therefore there is not any straightforward generalization of APEX

to the TCP case.

In the weak coupling limit both approximations, EXP and APEX,

reduce to the Debye-H¨uckel (DH) approximation.

Consider therefore the DH limit in the case of TCP. In the weak coupling limit the

pair correlation function is given by the screened pair approximation which in our case of

a two-component plasma reads [12]:

contribution of the bound states (which is not be considered here) has to be omitted. The

Slater sum will be considered in the next section.

To calculate the eﬀective ﬁeld E∗a(r) in Eq.(27) it suﬃces to use the linear DH approx-

since the nearest neighbour contribution to E∗a(r) is already singled out in Eq.(27). In

addition, the linear DH approximation leads to a perfect screening of the impurity charge,

which is an important requirement for a consistent approximation. The substitution of

Eq.(31) into Eq.(27) yields the Debye screened ﬁeld

III. SLATER SUM, SEMICLASSICAL MODEL AND MD-SIMULATIONS

As pointed out in the Introduction the idea of the semiclassical methods is to incor-

porate quantum-mechanical eﬀects (in particular the Heisenberg and the Pauli principle)

by appropriate eﬀective potentials.

An easy way to arrive at eﬀective potentials describing quantum eﬀects is the use of

the so-called Slater sums which were studied in detail by several authors [12,23]. The

Slater sum caracterizes the distribution of the system in coordinate space. Choosing the

logarithm of the Slater sum

U (N )(r1, . . . , rN ) =

T ln S(r1, . . . , rN )

,

−

(35)

as a potential for the classical motion of the particles, we map our quantum system

onto a classical one. The potentials U (N )(r1, . . . , rN ) are often called quantum statistical

eﬀective potentials and they are used to calculate the correct thermodynamic functions

of the original quantum system [12,23,18].

The Slater sum may be considered as an analogue of the classical Boltzmann factor.

The only modiﬁcation in comparison with the classical theory is the appearance of many-

particle interactions. If the system is not to dense (i.e., in the nondegenerate limit) one

may neglect the contributions of higher order many-particle interactions. In this case one

writes approximately,

U (N )(r1, . . . , rN )

uij(ri, rj)

(36)

where the eﬀective two-particle potential uab is deﬁned by the two-particle Slater sum Eq.

(30).

The Slater sum for the pair of charged particles can be approximated in diﬀerent ways.

Following Kelbg [15] one considers the Coulombic interaction as a perturbation; in the

ﬁrst order one gets the expression

An eﬀective potential similar to Eq. (37) was derived by Deutsch and was used in the

simulations by Hansen and McDonald [19].

The Kelbg potential is a good approximation for the two-particle Slater sum in the case

of small parameters ξab =

of the same type the correction ˜Aab includes also the exchange eﬀects , which make

the potential unsymmetrical (that means uei diﬀer from uee). The potential assymetry

becomes apparent at high temperatures (T > 100000 K) only.

In the present work we are interested in the regime of intermediate temperatures.

Therefore the simulations are performed with the potential Eq.(39) which is presented in

Fig. 1 and compared with other potentials approximating the two-particle Slater sum.

To check the quality of the predictions from the approximation given in Sec. II we

have performed a series of molecular dynamic simulations for comparison. The leap-frog

variant of Verlet’s algorithm was used to integrate numerically the equations of motions

obtained from the eﬀective potential Eq.(39). The simulations were performed using a

256-particle system of electrons and positrons with periodical boundary conditions. The

temperature of the system was choosen as T = 30 000 K, the coupling has varied from

weak coupling (Γ = 0.2) up to intermediate coupling (Γ = 2). In the investigated range of

plasma parameters the size of the simulation box was signiﬁcantly greater than the Debye

radius. Therefore the long-range Coulomb forces are screened inside each box and no

special procedure like Ewald summation was implemented to calculate them. Either MD

runs with Langevin source or MC procedures were used to establish thermal equilibrium

in the system, both methods have led to the same results.

In Figs. 2-5 we present the results of the approximation Eqs. (8) and (33) as well as

the Holtsmark (Eq. (9)) approximation. The short range potential in Eq. (33) is given

by the corrected Kelbg potential without the Coulomb term

with F (x) from Eq.(38).

The results of the analytical approximation are compared with MD data. It can be

seen from the ﬁgures that the Debye-H¨uckel approximation is in good agreement with the

MD data for the case of weak coupling, however, with increasing coupling strength this

14

agreement becomes poorer. This is not surprising, since the DH approximation is valid

only in the weak coupling regime. To get a better agreement for the case of intermediate

coupling one has to improve the calculation of the radial distribution function.

From the ﬁgures we also see that the MD data show a large probability of high mi-

croﬁeld values. The long tails in the distribution function reﬂect the attraction between

oppositely charged particles. As a result the probability to ﬁnd a particle of opposite

charge at small distances from the probe charge and thus producing large microﬁelds is

even higher than in the ideal Holtsmark case. This situation is in striking contrast to the

OCP case where the repulsion of particles with the same charge leads to a small prob-

ability of high microﬁeld values. As for the TCP the long tails are still present in the

case of an intermediate coupling for which the OCP microﬁeld distribution approaches

the Gaussian distribution Eq. (10) [9]. In the DH approximation the long tails are less

pronounced for the case Γ = 2. Here the Debye-H¨uckel length is smaller than the average

distance between the particles. Thus the particle interactions become screened even at

short distances. A result of this unphysical screening is the supression of high microﬁelds

within the DH approximation and for large coupling parameters. At still higher densities

(Γ

3 at T = 30 000 K) the De-Broglie wavelength becomes comparable with the inter-

≥

particle distance and the semi-classical approach employed in the numerical part of the

paper fails to describe the quantum two-component plasma properly.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The electric microﬁeld distribution at a charged particle in a two-component plasma

has been studied. Generalizing the corresponding transformation for the case of a classical

OCP we have expressed the Fourier transform of the electric microﬁeld distribution in

terms of generalized partial radial distribution functions. Using a simple Debye-H¨uckel

like generalized radial distribution function (including the unscreened short range part

stemming from the eﬀective potential) we have obtained theoretical predictions for the

15

electric microﬁeld distribution of the TCP. It has been shown that in contrast to the OCP

the second moment of the TCP microﬁeld distribution diverges.

Semiclassical molecular-dynamics simulations of the two-component plasma using ef-

fective potentials have been performed . The eﬀective potential was choosen to describe

the nondegenrate limit of the quantum system appropriately. The microﬁeld distribution

for diﬀerent coupling constants (from Γ = 0.2 to Γ = 2.0) has been obtained. With

increasing coupling strength the most probable value of electric microﬁelds is shifted to

lower ﬁelds. However, at all coupling strengths for which the simulations have been per-

formed the microﬁeld distribution shows long tails indicating a large probability of high

microﬁelds. This behavior is in contrast to the corresponding behavior in one-component

plasmas. It reﬂects the divergency of the second moment of the TCP microﬁeld distribu-

tion.

At weak coupling there is an overall agreement of the microﬁeld distribution obtained

by the analytical approximation with the MD data. Although our simple approximation

fails to provide accurate numerical results for larger coupling constants, the formalism

allows to generalize the results to the case of intermediate and strong coupling.

(Figure 1) Eﬀective potentials Eq.(37)(Kelbg potential) and Eq.(39) (corrected Kelbg

potential). The Kelbg potential is drawn for three temperatures, the corrected

Kelbg-potential is explicitely shown at T = 10 000 K for both interactions and

at T = 100 000 K for the electron-electron interaction only;

in the other cases

the corrected Kelbg potential coincides with the Kelbg potential within the ﬁgure

accuracy. For comparison we have included also the low-temperature limit of the

eﬀective potential of free charges (the “classical” potential-dashed line); the repulsive

part of the classical potential coincides with the bare Coulomb potential.

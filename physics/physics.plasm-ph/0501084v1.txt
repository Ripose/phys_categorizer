A recently introduced method utilizing dimensional continuation is em-
ployed to compute the energy loss rate for a non-relativistic particle moving
through a highly ionized plasma. No restriction is made on the charge, mass,
or speed of this particle.
It is, however, assumed that the plasma is not
strongly coupled in the sense that the dimensionless plasma coupling parame-
ter g = e2κD/4πT is small, where κD is the Debye wave number of the plasma.
To leading and next-to-leading order in this coupling, dE/dx is of the generic
form g2 ln[Cg2]. The precise numerical coeﬃcient out in front of the loga-
rithm is well known. We compute the constant C under the logarithm exactly
for arbitrary particle speeds. Our exact results diﬀer from approximations
given in the literature. The diﬀerences are in the range of 20% for cases rel-
evant to inertial conﬁnement fusion experiments. The same method is also
employed to compute the rate of momentum loss for a projectile moving in
a plasma, and the rate at which two plasmas at diﬀerent temperatures come
into thermal equilibrium. Again these calculations are done precisely to the
order given above. The loss rates of energy and momentum uniquely deﬁne
a Fokker-Planck equation that describes particle motion in the plasma. The
coeﬃcients determined in this way are thus well-deﬁned, contain no arbitrary
parameters or cutoﬀs, and are accurate to the order described. This Fokker-
Planck equation describes the straggling — the spreading in the longitudinal
position of a group of particles with a common initial velocity and position —
and the transverse diﬀusion of a beam of particles. It should be emphasized
that our work does not involve a model, but rather it is a precisely deﬁned
evaluation of the leading terms in a well-deﬁned perturbation theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

The methods of quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT), originally developed to describe the inter-
actions of elementary particles, have since been successfully applied in several other ﬁelds
of physics, including plasma theory. Condensed matter physics in particular has been a

proving ground for the utility of QFT methodology. The Kondo problem, phase transfor-
mations in magnetic metals, and a host of other problems in condensed matter theory have

been tackled using QFT methods [1–3]. Classical non-equilibrium reaction-diﬀusion sys-
tems have been studied using QFT techniques since the pioneering work of Doi in 1976 [4].

More recently the methods of eﬀective ﬁeld theory were applied to multicomponent, fully
ionized plasmas by Brown and Yaﬀe [5]. These methods signiﬁcantly simplify high-order

perturbative calculations and clarify the structure of the theory. Here we use the method of
dimensional continuation, which was originally developed as a means of regularizing diver-
gent integrals that arise in perturbative calculations in gauge-invariant QFT, to calculate the

stopping power and temperature equilibration in highly ionized plasmas. The well-known
Lenard-Balescu kinetic equation [6,7] describes the long-distance, collective excitations of

the plasma, whereas the Boltzmann equation for pure Coulomb scattering describes the
short-distance, hard collisions of the plasma particles. A complete description of the plasma

includes both the long- and short-distance physics encoded in the Lenard-Balescu and Boltz-
mann equations, but each contribution is divergent if integrated over all of three-dimensional
space. A ﬁnite sum, the large Coulomb logarithm and its coeﬃcient, can be obtained by

introducing cutoﬀs, but this approach does not determine the constants that accompany the
logarithm. These additional constants are given by the convergent kinetic equation method

[8], but spurious higher-order terms are introduced. In contrast, our method, which is based
on a rigorous expansion in a small parameter and dimensional continuation of the Lenard-

Balescu and Boltzmann equations, gives the constants accompanying the Coulomb logarithm
but no spurious higher-order terms.

In the course of presenting our calculations of the stopping power we make frequent
contact with the existing literature and unify many previous results; thus this work serves
as a review. On the other hand, we do present some original results: we introduce new

methods, obtain an analytic expression for the stopping power in a fully ionized plasma
that is more accurate than all previous expressions, and we provide a more precise deﬁnition

of the Fokker-Planck equation for dilute plasmas. In order to make this Report accessible
to readers who are not experts in plasma theory or have no familiarity with dimensional

continuation or both, it is largely self-contained and is written in a pedagogical style.

II. METHOD

Many physical problems involve both large and small length scales and are governed by
a small parameter g, with 0 < g
1. Two diﬀerent physical mechanisms dominate at
short and large distances. An infrared (IR) mechanism dominates at large distances or low

≪

energies; an ultraviolet (UV) mechanism dominates at short distances or high energies. In
plasma physics, the long-distance, collective eﬀects (described to leading order by a dielec-

tric function) are the dominant infrared eﬀects that set the long-distance scale. The hard
Coulomb collisions, cut oﬀ by either the classical minimum approach distance or by the

quantum maximum momentum transfer, are the ultraviolet mechanisms that set the short-
distance scale. A novel application of dimensional continuation has recently been introduced

[9] to treat such problems when they can be formulated in spaces of arbitrary dimensionality
ν. If the spatial dimensionality ν is analytically continued below the physical ν = 3, then
the infrared mechanism dominates for all scales and, since it is dominant, its contribution is

thus easy to compute in the lower spatial dimensions. On the other hand, if ν is continued
above ν = 3, then the ultraviolet mechanism dominates for all scales, and this diﬀerent

contribution is easy to compute in the higher spatial dimensions. As a simple example, let
us consider a case in which the dominate infrared mechanism for ν < 3 gives the leading
contribution of order g2−(3−ν), while the dominate ultraviolet mechanism for ν > 3 gives the
leading contribution of order g2−(ν−3):

g2−(ν−3) for ν > 3 (UV) ,
g2−(3−ν) for ν < 3 (IR) .

(2.1)

The actual ν dependence is slightly more complicated for the problem we will study; there-
fore, we shall look at this simple example ﬁrst since it illustrates the point more concisely.
From Eq. (2.1), we see that when the infrared contribution is analytically continued from

ν < 3 to ν > 3 it becomes subleading compared to the ultraviolet contribution since
g−(3−ν) < g−(ν−3) for ν > 3. Conversely, when continued to ν < 3, the ultraviolet mechanism
becomes subleading compared to the infrared mechanism. One concludes that the sum of
the two processes contains both the leading and the (ﬁrst) subleading terms for all spatial

dimensionality ν near the physical value ν = 3, and hence this sum provides the correct
result in the physical limit ν

3.

In general, the dominant infrared mechanism will contain a pole (3

in arbitrary dimensionality about ν = 3 with no inﬁnities when ν = 3, these two poles must
cancel. Residues of the poles bring in logarithms of the ratio of the relevant short and long

distance scales (or high and low energy scales). Often, this ratio is large, giving a large
logarithm. It must be emphasized that our method evaluates not only the coeﬃcient of such

large logarithms, but also the constant terms underneath the logarithm. This is so because it
computes both the leading and ﬁrst subleading terms. Often in a physical problem it is easy

to compute the large logarithm, but the computation of the constant under the logarithm
cannot be done or is very diﬃcult to do. The new dimensional continuation method makes

this easy. Since the method just described is somewhat subtle, another simple but fully
pedagogical example of how it works out is given in Appendix A.

One could object that we do not explicitly prove that larger subleading terms are not
present: one may ask if an additional term that has a power dependence between g2−(ν−3)
and g2−(3−ν) can appear. However, simple dimensional analysis shows that such terms of
intermediate order cannot be formed. The point is that, in examples such as the one we
consider, only two physical mechanisms dominate, one at large and the other at small scales.

Since the two mechanisms involve diﬀerent physics, it is natural that diﬀerent combinations
of the basic physical parameters come into play, and hence give quite diﬀerent dependencies
on the small parameter g when the dimension ν departs from ν = 3.

We have illustrated the method of dimensional continuation by a very simple model of
the ν-dependence of the coupling parameter g given in (2.1). For the case we shall examine,

however, the dependence on ν is somewhat more complex, although the same dimensional
continuation arguments apply. For a plasma, we shall see that the leading infrared and
ultraviolet mechanisms behave as g2−(3−ν) and g2, respectively. When the infrared term
is analytically continued from ν < 3 to ν > 3, it becomes subleading since g2+(ν−3) < g2
for ν > 3. Conversely, when we analytically continue from ν > 3 to ν < 3, even though
the ultraviolet mechanism has no ν dependence, it nonetheless becomes subleading since
g2 < g2−(3−ν) for ν < 3. The parameter g2 is a dimensionless constant proportional to the
overall plasma number density n. The additional parameters needed to form a dimensionless
coupling g2 involve the electric charge e and temperature T . At ν = 3, the coupling is of the
generic form g2 = e6 n/T 3, in agreement with Eq. (2.2) below. As will be seen explicitly in
what follows, the leading hard process for ν > 3 involves scattering and is thus proportional
to n giving a g2 contribution as stated here. The leading soft process for ν < 3 is essentially
E heating which, for dimensional reasons, is proportional to κ(ν−1), where κ is the Debye
j
·
wave number, giving a g(ν−1) = g2−(3−ν) contribution as stated here.

potential energy has the form e2/(4πr). We do this because then no factor of 4π appears in
Poisson’s equation for the potential, a factor that is peculiar to three-dimensional space, and we
shall need to work in a space with ν

= 3 dimensions.

temperature, for completeness we shall work in a general case in which each plasma species b is in
thermal equilibrium with itself at temperature Tb.

That plasma perturbation theory involves integer powers of g is discussed in detail, for example, in
Brown and Yaﬀe [5] in footnote 26 and in Section 3 of Appendix F. The plasma coupling parameter
g also appears explicitly in the BBGKY equation chain if times are scaled by the inverse plasma
frequency and lengths are scaled by the Debye length. See, for example, Section 12.5.1 of Clemmow
and Dougherty [10] who denote g by 1/nh3. It is worth noting that the inverse of the number of
particles in a sphere whose radius is the Debye length is given by [(4π/3)κ−3n]−1 = 3g.

that measure the strength of the interaction of the projectile of charge ep with a plasma
particle of charge eb, with a typical or average relative velocity ¯vpb between the projectile
and plasma particle. The presence of Planck’s constant ~ in the denominator shows that
this is a quantum-mechanical, Coulomb coupling parameter. When ¯vpb becomes large, ¯ηpb
becomes small. This is equivalent to the formal limit of large ~. Hence, when ¯ηpb is small,
quantum eﬀects may be important. The plasma is taken to be composed of non-relativistic

particles that have no degeneracy so that they are described by classical, Boltzmann statis-
tics. We show in Appendix B that the ‘Convergent Kinetic Theory’ method of Refs. [11],

[12], and [8], when evaluated in the leading order in which it was derived, produces the
same results that are produced by our method of dimensional continuation. However, that
method generally produces spurious, higher-order corrections in the plasma parameter that

must be discarded. They must be discarded because they do not include all of the terms
of the given order in the plasma coupling parameter. The inclusion of these terms gives,
in general, misleading results4. Our method has the virtue of producing only the leading
order terms unaccompanied by any other spurious, higher-order terms, terms that must be

4A striking example of how the retention of only a part of the terms in a given order can give a
very misleading result is provided by the calculation of the energy variation of the strength of the
strong interaction in elementary particle physics. The easiest part of the computation is to obtain
the eﬀects of virtual quarks, which is akin to traditional calculations in quantum electrodynamics.
If this is done, one concludes that the strength of the interaction increases with energy. However,
these quark terms are only a part of the leading-order result. In this same order, the contribution
of virtual gluons overwhelms that of the quarks and the total, complete result shows that the
interaction strength decreases as the energy increases. An even more blatant example of the error
of principle entailed in keeping only some but not all terms of a given order is provided by the
instruction in an elementary physics lab: the sum of 2.1 and 2.123456 is 4.2, not 4.223456; it is
inconsistent to retain more decimal places than those of the number with least accuracy. In physics,
half a loaf is not better than none.

deleted in other methods. Some authors, for example Refs. [13] and [14], retain the spurious
higher-order terms and thus provide inconsistent results.

Exactly the same considerations apply to the calculation of the momentum loss as a
projectile traverses a plasma. This result, taken together with the energy loss computation,
uniquely determine the coeﬃcients in a Fokker-Planck equation that describes the general,
statistical, motion of particles in the plasma. Such coeﬃcients are sometimes described as
“Rosenbluth potentials” which were introduced in Ref. [15] and discussed in several places, a
good reference being Ref. [16]. Our coeﬃcients, however, contain no arbitrary parameters or
cutoﬀs and are well-deﬁned with no ambiguity to the order g2 ln Cg2 to which we work. We
also apply the same methods to calculate the rate of equilibration of two plasma components
at diﬀerent temperatures, again with leading and next-to-leading accuracy in the plasma
coupling g. We shall postpone the derivation and description of the Fokker-Planck equation
until we have ﬁrst presented our results for the energy loss or stopping power dE/dx for
several cases of interest.

We have stated that our result is generically of order g2[ln g2 + const]. This gives the
correct order as far as the plasma density n is concerned, namely, discarding other parameters
that are needed to provide the right dimensions, the result is of order n[ln n + const]. But
we should describe the accuracy of the result in this paper with more care. It is of the form

pb and are thus necessarily of order n3/2 in the plasma density. These Barkas terms, as well

The usual method for obtaining the energy loss for a charged particle moving through
matter is to divide the calculation into two parts: the long-distance, soft collisions and the
short-distance, hard collisions. Collective eﬀects are important in the long-distance part,
and it is evaluated from the j
E energy loss of a particle moving in a dielectric medium.
The hard collisions are described by Coulomb scattering. The rub is to join the disparate
pieces together. For the case of classical scattering, this is often done by computing the
energy loss in Coulomb scattering out to some arbitrary long-distance, maximum impact
parameter B, and then adding the j
E energy loss integrated over the space outside of a
cylinder whose radius is this maximum impact parameter. The hard scattering processes
within the cylinder produce a logarithmic factor ln(B/bmin), where bmin is the minimum
classical distance of closest approach in the Coulomb scattering. The soft, collective eﬀects
outside the cylinder produce a factor involving the Debye radius κ−1
D , ln(1/κDB), which has
the same overall outside factor. Thus the arbitrary radius B cancels when the two parts
are added. Hence such methods must yield the correct coeﬃcient of the large logarithm
ln(1/κDbmin), and they do so without much diﬃculty of computation. However, the purely
numerical constants that accompany the logarithm (which are expected to be of order one)
are harder to compute. Here we describe an easily applied method that yields a unique
result – the result including the constants in addition to the large logarithm. The new
idea is to compute the energy loss from Coulomb scattering over all impact parameters,
but for dimensions ν > 3 where there are no infrared divergences. A separate calculation
of the energy loss using a generalization of the j
E heating is done for ν < 3, where the
volume integration may be extended down to the particle’s position without encountering
an ultraviolet divergence. Both of these results have a simple pole at ν = 3, but they both
may be analytically continued beyond their initial range of validity. In their original domain
of dimension ν, both calculations are performed to the leading order in the plasma density.
As will be seen, although the Coulomb scattering result is the leading order contribution for
E heating is subleading
ν > 3, it becomes subleading order when ν < 3. Conversely, the j

for ν > 3 but leading for ν < 3. Hence, the sum of the two (analytically continued) processes
gives the leading and (ﬁrst) subleading terms in the plasma density for all dimensions ν, and
thus, in the limit ν
3, the pole terms of this sum must cancel with the remainder yielding
the correct physical limit to leading order in the plasma density.

→

The highly ionized classical plasma with which we are concerned is described exactly
by a coupled set of kinetic equations, the well-known BBGKY hierarchy as described, for
example, in Section 3.5 of Ref. [18]. This fundamental theoretical description makes no
explicit reference to the spatial dimensionality, and hence it is valid for a range of spatial
dimensions ν about ν = 3. Thus our method of dimensional continuation may be applied to
a plasma. This hierarchy holds for arbitrary plasma densities. We are interested, however,
in the computation to leading order in the plasma density of the energy loss of a particle
traversing the plasma. The leading low-density limit of the BBGKY hierarchy changes as the
spatial dimensionality ν changes. For ν < 3, the long-distance, collective eﬀects dominate,
and the equation derived by Lenard and Balescu applies [6,7]. An alternative derivation
of their result is presented by Dupree [19], and a clear pedagogical discussion appears in
Nicholson [20]. Clemmow and Dougherty [10] provide a derivation of the Lenard-Balescu
equation and prove that it shares the basic features of the Boltzmann equation; namely that
it conserves particle number, total momentum and energy, and that it obeys an H-theorem
(entropy increases) like the Boltzmann equation with the long-time, equilibrium solution
being a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The equation describes the interaction of the
various species that the plasma may contain. In the limit in which one species is very dilute,
as is our case in which we examine the motion of a single “test particle” or “projectile” moving
through the plasma, the energy lost in the particle motion is described by a generalization
E Joule heating with the background plasma response given by the permittivity of
of its j
a collisionless plasma. On the other hand, when the spatial dimension ν is greater than 3,
the short-distance, hard Coulomb collisions dominate. For these dimensions, the leading low
density limit of the BBGKY hierarchy is described by the familiar Boltzmann equation.7 The
Boltzmann equation is derived, for example, in Section 16 of Ref. [21] and also in Section 3.5
of Ref. [18]. We use the Boltzmann equation to obtain the leading order energy loss rate
when ν > 3. Since we are concerned with the motion of a single “projectile”, the Boltzmann
equation reduces to the product of the energy loss weighted cross section times the plasma
density. The derivations that we have just described, which start from ﬁrst principles, justify
the methods outlined in the previous paragraph, the methods that we shall use.

·

7In this case, we may go beyond the classical BBGKY hierarchy limit in that we may use the full
quantum-mechanical cross section rather than its classical limit in the Boltzmann equation. The
validity of this extension is, however, obvious on physical grounds.

11

In Ref. [9], the method was illustrated by the simpliﬁed case in which the charged particle
moved through a dilute plasma with a speed that is much larger than the speeds of the

thermal electrons in the plasma. Here we shall extend that work to the case in which the
charged particle projectile moves with arbitrary speeds. As we have noted above, we work
in the dilute limit in which the plasma density is our small parameter.8 It is obvious that
the energy loss for ν > 3 as calculated for scattering is proportional to the ﬁrst power of
the plasma density, dE >/dx
n. On the other hand, as we shall see explicitly below, the
n1−(3−ν)/2 Thus we see
computation of the energy loss for ν < 3 behaves as dE </dx
explicitly that the infrared computation that accounts for the collective eﬀects in the plasma
and gives the leading term for ν < 3 becomes non-leading when it is analytically continued to
ν > 3. Conversely, the ultraviolet, hard scattering computation, which is leading for ν > 3,

becomes subleading when analytically continued to ν < 3. We conclude that the leading
order (in density) energy loss of a projectile particle moving in three dimensions is given by

To the order in the coupling g to which we work, a plasma species b is described completely
by a phase space density fb(r, p, t). The projectile p may also be described by a phase space
density fp(r, p, t) that contains delta functions restricting the momenta p and the coordinates
r to be those of the projectile’s trajectory. The projectile energy loss (or “stopping power”)
that we deal with is the rate of kinetic energy loss, the time derivative of (in ν dimensions)

The total kinetic energy of plasma particles of species b is given by

The Lenard-Balescu and Boltzmann equations that we use to derive the projectiles’ energy

8One should work with a dimensionless parameter so that stating that it is small is unambigu-
ous. For our case, the dimensionless parameter is the square of the plasma coupling parameter,

parameter.

There are, of course, additional contributions to the total energy — potential energy con-
tributions that involve collective plasma eﬀects. The kinetic energies are of zeroth order in
the plasma coupling g and their time derivatives, which come about because of the Coulomb
forces, are of order g2 ln g2. On the other hand, the potential energies (and possible collec-
tive eﬀects) are of higher order in the coupling g and their time derivatives are of an order
that is higher than that to which we compute. Hence these potential energy terms do not
contribute to the energy balances accounted for by the Lenard-Balescu and Boltzmann equa-
tions, and only the kinetic energies are relevant. We conclude that, to the accuracy to which
we compute, we have an unambiguous partition of the projectile’s energy loss into energies
gained by individual particle species in the plasma. We deﬁne the energy loss dE/dx of the
projectile to be positive,

deﬁnes the energy loss of the projectile p to the plasma particles of species b or, equivalently,
the energy gain of the plasma particles b brought about by the projectile p moving through
the plasma with velocity vp. Such an unambiguous partition into the energy gained by the
individual species in the plasma does not hold in higher orders, and so such an accounting
cannot be done for strongly coupled plasmas which are entangled with collective excitations.
An important check of the validity of our results is that they satisfy the condition that
the total energy loss vanishes for a swarm of projectile particles in thermal equilibrium with
the plasma through which they move. We must have

Thus the energy loss dE/dx must become negative for low projectile velocities vp so that
its integral over all velocities can vanish. As we shall see, this constraint is an automatic
consequence of the method that we employ.

We turn now to describe the results of the calculation of dE/dx. In addition to parti-
tioning the energy loss into diﬀerent particle species that make up the plasma, we shall also
increase the generality of our results by assuming that, although each species b is internally

13

in thermal equilibrium, it may have a private temperature Tb which diﬀers from species to
species. We shall brieﬂy compare our results in the classical limit with PIC simulation data9,
illustrate our stopping power under solar conditions, and provide a more lengthy exposition
relevant for inertially conﬁned laser fusion experiments. These examples illustrate the cal-

culation of dE/dx within our method, and we can directly compare our results for dE/dx
with those that are typical of the current literature. The dimensional continuation method

that we have developed and applied to the calculation of the stopping power can be used
to calculate other physical processes. As a ﬁnal example, we also will use this method to

compute the rate at which Coulomb interactions in a dilute plasma bring two species into
thermal equilibrium. The mass ratios and initial temperatures are arbitrary, and quantum
corrections are included. Like the stopping power, the temperature equilibration rate10 is
(g3), and we calculate the prefactor B and the constant C
of the form Γ = Bg2 ln Cg2 +
under the logarithm exactly. After presenting these results, we shall describe the general

O

formulation that results in a Fokker-Planck equation. The range of validity of the Fokker-
Planck equation will be assessed, and then we shall present the derivations of details of our

results.

III. RESULTS

For ν > 3, the BBGKY hierarchy reduces, in our dilute plasma limit, to the Boltz-
mann equation with classical Coulomb scattering. In this higher-dimensional space, only the
squared momentum transfer weighted Coulomb collision cross section enters into the rate

of energy loss. Although quantum-mechanical corrections are not signiﬁcant in the lower-
dimensional ν < 3 spatial regions where long-distance eﬀects dominate, they may be impor-

tant in the higher-dimensional ν > 3 space in which the short-distance collisions dominate.

9In the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique as applied to plasmas, the plasma species are modeled as
collections of quasi-particles, each representing a large number of real particles, moving through
a numerical grid. The particle positions and a weighting factor are used to assign electric charge
densities to the nodes of the grid. Poisson’s equation is then solved for the potentials at the
nodes, which gives the electric ﬁelds at the nodes, and ﬁnally an inverse weighting factor is used to
determine the electric ﬁeld at the particle positions. The particles are then moved using Newton’s
equations to start the next time step.

10It should be clear from the context in which it is used, whether the letter Γ stands for a rate
rather than the traditional plasma coupling mentioned in footnote 3.

14

And although our approach is initially based on the classical BBGKY hierarchy, it is physi-
cally obvious that quantum corrections must be incorporated in the higher-dimensional re-
gion when they become important. The dimensionless parameter that distinguishes whether
or not quantum eﬀects must be taken into account is (in the ν

3 limit)

→

¯ηpb =

epeb
4π~ ¯vpb

,

where ¯vpb is a typical relative velocity of the projectile (p) of charge ep and a plasma particle
(b) of charge eb. The limit of large ¯ηpb describes slow particles. This limit is equivalent to
the formal ~
0 limit, and thus the classical calculation applies here. However, when ¯ηpb is
not large, quantum eﬀects must be taken into account for ν > 3. We shall ﬁrst examine the
classical case and then later the quantum corrections to it.

Here K is an arbitrary wave number. As we shall soon show, the total result (3.2) does
not depend upon K. However, sometimes choosing K to be a suitable multiple of the Debye
wave number of the plasma simpliﬁes the formula.

We use vp to denote the speed of the projectile of charge ep and mass mp whose rate of
energy loss in the plasma we are computing. Rationalized units are used for the charge so
that, for example, the Coulomb potential energy in three dimensions reads e2
p/(4πr). We
write the inverse temperature of the plasma species b as βb = T −1
, which we measure in
energy units. The charge and mass of the plasma particle of species b are written as eb and
mb, with the corresponding Debye wave number κb of this species deﬁned by

b

where nb is the number density of species b. The total Debye wave number κD is deﬁned by
the sum over all the species

It is worthwhile noting here several properties that will be needed throughout for an under-

Hence the variable change v

To show the overall independence of the wavenumber K, we take the analogous deriva-
tive of Eq.(3.3) and make the variable change u = cos2 θ. One term involves du u1/2 =
2d cos θ cos2 θ, the other du u1/2 u−1 = 2d cos θ. For the integral involving this second term,
we insert 1 = d cos θ/d cos θ in the integrand, and integrate the result by parts. In this way
we ﬁnd that the total result (3.2) is indeed independent of the arbitrary wave number K.

The classical result applies for a low velocity projectile moving in a relatively cool plasma.

In addition to such physical applications, our results, which are rigorous and model inde-
pendent to the order g2 ln Cg2 to which we compute, may be used to check the validity of
computer calculations such as those utilizing classical molecular dynamics, as illustrated in
Figs. 1 and 2. Such calculations must agree with our results in those regions where the

plasma coupling g is not large. The following ﬁgures display our analytic results for the
energy loss (3.2) using the classical expressions (3.3) and (3.4). They are compared with

the molecular dynamics calculations of Zwicknagel, Toeppfer, and Reinhard [22], as cited in
Ref. [14]. See also the review of Zwicknagel, Toeppfer, and Reinhard [23].

these cases, the quantum parameters deﬁned in (3.1),

are large. In the energy loss problem, these are the only independent dimensionless param-
eters that entail the quantum unit, Planck’s constant ~. The parameters are large when the
average relative velocity ¯vpb is small which, as far as an ¯ηpb parameter is concerned, corre-
sponds to the formal limit ~
0. In this section, we treat the general case where the size
of the quantum parameters ¯ηpb has no restriction.

According to our dimensional continuation method and, in particular, the discussion
leading to (10.27), the general case is obtained by adding a correction to the classical result

Li and Petrasso [24] have evaluated the energy loss dE/dx to leading order in the plasma
coupling, the order g2 ln g contribution, and they have added an estimation of the constant
under the logarithm, the term of order g2 ln C that we compute exactly. They do this by
working with a Fokker-Planck approximation to the Boltzmann equation. They then deﬁne
a Coulomb logarithm by using a somewhat arbitrary minimal classical impact parameter
that is then corrected in a rather ad-hoc fashion to take account of quantum-mechanical
corrections. A term involving a step function is added to the formula to correct for long-
distance collective eﬀects. Using our notation, the ﬁnal result of Li and Petrasso [24] appears

The ﬁgures show fair agreement between our results and those of Li and Petrasso in regions
where the projectile velocities are large, but signiﬁcant discrepancies appear for small and
intermediate projectile velocities. These discrepancies are related to the fact that the rate
of energy loss for Li and Petrasso (LP) does not keep a swarm of projectiles in thermal equi-
librium with the plasma particles even though the swarm has the same initial temperature
as that in the plasma, whereas we will show in (4.24) that our (BPS) energy loss expression
does maintain thermal equilibrium. This is to say, the thermal average for Li and Petrasso,

Figure 6 illustrates the size of the quantum corrections given in (3.19) relative to the
classical formula (3.2). For the parameters listed in its caption, the quantum correction is
about 40% of the classical contribution for vp/¯ve greater than 2. For lesser values of the
projectile velocity, the relative importance of the quantum correction decreases.

D. Quantum Limit

We started our discussion of the stopping power by examining the low velocity limit.

This limit is contained in the classical result (3.2), which adds the regular, long-distance
contribution (3.4) to the well-behaved sum of singular short- and long-distance contributions
(3.3). The long-distance, collective eﬀects are always described by the classical dielectric

properties of the plasma. The short-distance eﬀects presented in Eq. (3.3) involve a classical
description of the Coulomb scattering which gives a classical minimum approach distance
b0 = (epeb/4π)(1/mpbv2
pb) that provides the short-distance cutoﬀ. This classical description
of the scattering is valid in those situations where the projectile velocity vp is suﬃciently
low. The momentum transfer deﬁnes a quantum wave length of order ~/(mpbvpb). When
this length is on the order of, or larger than, the classical minimum approach distance b0,

24

then the detailed quantum-mechanical treatment that we have given is needed. When the
quantum wave length is much greater than the classical minimum approach distance b0, then
the full quantum description of the short-distance scattering simpliﬁes, with the ﬁrst Born
approximation suﬃcing. This happens when ~/(mpbvpb)
pb), or when
ηpb = (epeb/4π~vpb)

E. Results Relevant for Laser Fusion

We turn now to examine cases that are relevant to the DT plasmas in laser fusion capsules.
In an inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) capsule ﬁlled with DT gas, an α particle of energy
α + n. This α particle
E0 = 3.54 MeV is created at threshold in the reaction D + T
slows down and eventually deposits its energy into the plasma, if the range is short enough,
or exits the ICF capsule entirely, if the range is too long. The more energy deposited into

the plasma by the α particle then the hotter the plasma becomes, and this in turn increases
the rate of DT fusion. Obviously then, the precise value of the α particle range can have a

dramatic impact on ICF performance.

Again we shall assume that all the electrons and ions are at a common temperature T .

As we shall see, our results can diﬀer by 20% or so from those of Li and Petrasso [24], results
that have been used in the description of such laser fusion experiments14. We ﬁrst plot in
Fig. 7 the total energy loss to all species dE/dx for an alpha particle moving through a DT
plasma with a temperature T = 3 keV and electron density ne = 1025 cm−3. We shall also
exhibit in Fig. 8 the separate energy losses to the electrons and to the ions that are composed
of equal numbers of deuterons and tritons. Again our results are compared to those of Li
and Petrasso.

FIG. 7. Alpha particle projectile traversing an equal molal DT plasma. The stopping power dE/dx
(in MeV/µm) is plotted vs. energy E (in Mev). The solid line is the result from this work (BPS),
while the dashed line is the result of Li and Petrasso (LP). The energy domain lies between zero and
the α particle energy E0 = 3.54 MeV produced in the DT reaction. The plasma temperature is
1025 cm−3, with deuterium-tritium number densities

FIG. 8. The results of Fig. 7 split into separate ion (peaked curves) and electron components (softly

increasing curves).

As shown in Fig. 8, for ion projectiles, the energy loss to the electrons in the plasma
dominates over that to the ions when the projectile energy becomes suﬃciently large on
the scale of the temperature T . Here we provide an estimate of the energy at which this
cross over takes place, an estimate that is valid to logarithmic accuracy, which holds when
the logarithmic term in the energy loss formula – the “Coulomb logarithm” – is large and
dominant. We do this for a plasma whose various species are all at the same temperature
T . Denoting this logarithmic term by L, which we treat as a constant since its variation
within an integral is small, the logarithmic contribution to the stopping power is contained
in Eq. (9.5) and reads

The corresponding energy loss to the electrons in the plasma is, of course, just Ee = E0 −
We can use the rough logarithmic approximations of the previous paragraph to estimate
the energy transfer. We use the sum of the approximate ionic stopping powers (3.46) in
the numerator of Eq. (3.50) and add the approximate electronic part (3.47) to this for the
denominator in Eq. (3.50). Changing the integration variable E to an appropriately scaled
velocity then yields, in this logarithmic approximation,

For the parameters of Fig. 8, this crude limit gives 0.24 MeV to be compared with the value
of EI = 0.38 MeV that comes from a numerical evaluation of Eq. (3.50) using our complete
energy loss formulas with an initial energy of E0 = 3.54 MeV [c.f. Fig. 10]. In this case, the
0.38 =
energy loss to the ions is small in comparison to that lost to the electrons, Ee = 3.54
3.16 Mev. It is interesting to note that, since the approximate limit scales linearly with the
temperature, if the plasma temperature is increased by an order of magnitude, from 3 keV
to 30 keV, the limit of 0.24 MeV moves to 2.4 Mev. A numerical evaluation similar to that
reported in Fig. 10 for this increased temperature of 30 keV gives EI = 1.8 MeV. This is
now comparable to the energy transfer to the electrons, Ee = 3.5
1.8 = 1.7 MeV. We
should note that, as the temperature is increased with a ﬁxed initial projectile energy E0,
E0/EL in Eq. (3.52) is reduced, and so its replacement by the
the upper integration limit
limit x =

DT alphas moving in a hotter, more dense plasma, a plasma at 30 keV and an electron
number density 1027 cm−3; see Figs. 11–14. In the previous case, most of the alpha particle
energy was deposited into electrons. In the new case, much of this energy is now transfered
directly into the ions. The new, much denser case clearly has a much shorter alpha particle

F. Plasma Temperature Equilibration

We now present our results for the temperature equilibration of a plasma in which dif-
ferent components have diﬀerent temperatures. This is quite common since plasmas may

be created in ways that more eﬀectively heat one plasma species over another; for example,
when a plasma experiences a laser pulse which preferentially heats the light electrons that

have the larger scattering cross section. We therefore assume that two species a and b are
in thermal equilibrium with themselves but at two diﬀerent temperatures Ta and Tb. Then
rate of energy exchange between the subsystems a and b is

d
Eab
dt

=

−Cab(Ta −

Tb) ,

(3.57)

and in this section we present our calculation of the coeﬃcients

Cab accurate to order g2 ln Cg2.
We should remind the reader that there is an hierarchy in which the the light electrons ﬁrst
come into equilibrium among themselves, then the heaver ions equilibrate among themselves,

and lastly the electron-ions equilibrate in temperature. Consider now the typical case of a

36

plasma of light electrons and heavy ions, in which the electrons and ions have respectively
equilibrated with themselves. The electrons will have a temperature Te, and and suppose all
the ions have had time to equilibrate to a common ion temperature Ti. The rate of energy
exchange between the electrons and the total ion system is

IV. GENERAL FORMULATION

Thus far we have examined only the de-acceleration of charged particles caused by the
stopping power dE/dx. This slowing down of a particle keeps it moving in a straight line, and
all particles starting from the same place with the same velocity slow to a thermal velocity

at exactly the same ﬁnal position. But in fact, the width of a narrow beam of particles
will increase as the particles move through a plasma — there will be a sort of Brownian
motion in the directions that are transverse to the beam direction. A particle will acquire
an increasing average squared transverse velocity as it propagates through a plasma. This
is transverse diﬀusion. Moreover, the ending positions of a group of particles with identical

37

starting conditions will be spread out along the longitudinal, beam direction to a small
extent. This is straggling.

These random, statistical eﬀects may be accounted for in ﬁrst approximation by describ-

ing the charged particle transport by the Fokker-Planck equation

where f (r, p, t) is the phase space number density for a swarm of particles injected into the
plasma, each with a common mass m. The momentum derivative ∂/∂pk acts on everything to
its right, including the distribution function f . An implicit summation convention in which

repeated indices are summed over will be used for vector components, and these indices will
be denoted by the Latin letters k and l. On the other hand, sums over the plasma species

b will always be made explicit. In other words, repeated b indices are not summed, while
repeated k and l indices are summed. These conventions are followed in (4.1). For each
species index b, the scattering tensor C kl
is symmetric in k and l, as the decomposition
b
(4.18) will illustrate.

The Boltzmann equation reduces to the Fokker-Planck equation when the collisions trans-

fer only small momenta in comparison with the particle momentum. The way in which this
limit of the Boltzmann equation works out is described in detail in Appendix15 C. The
Lenard-Balescu equation is of the form of a Fokker-Planck equation. Since the right-hand
side of the Fokker-Planck equation entails an overall derivative in momentum, it conserves

the particle number density. The terms in the ﬁnal square brackets on the right-hand side
of the equation ensure that this side of the equation vanishes for a thermal distribution of
at inverse temperature β, provided the background plasma

components have the common temperature determined by the distribution function, namely
βb = β for all species b. Thus a thermal distribution of particles is maintained by the
Fokker-Planck equation.

Here we shall obtain a precise evaluation of the tensor functions C kl

15In this regard, we should note that although a “diﬀusion approximation” to the Boltzmann
equation is outlined in Lifshitz and Pitaevskii [26], that discussion is in the context of dilute heavy
particles moving in a gas of light particles. This is a kinematical restriction that is quite diﬀerent
than the dynamical case of sharply peaked forward scattering that we examine in Appendix C. To
make this distinction clear, we also review the work of Lifshitz and Pitaevskii in Appendix C, where
we show by a simple example that their result is not internally consistent unless further restrictions
are imposed.

we have already discussed. That is, we shall compute not only the leading logarithms, but
also the constant terms under the logarithms. In this way, among other things, we shall give
a precise and unambiguous deﬁnition of the Landau Collision Integral for Coulomb scatter-
ing [27]. We shall deﬁne the functions C kl
b by requiring that the Fokker-Planck equation
reproduce the rate of energy and momentum loss to the plasma species b, quantities that are
well deﬁned to the leading log plus constant order to which we work, and quantities that we
compute using the method of dimensional continuation that we have described.

As a charged particle slows down, large angle scattering events become more important.
Such hard collisions are not described by the Fokker-Planck equation, and it starts to loose
its accuracy of describing charged particle trajectories, particularly with regard to the trans-
verse motion. We shall obtain quantitative criteria for the regions where the Fokker-Planck
equation ceases to be an accurate description. We shall assess the validity of the Fokker-
Planck description by computing the rate of transverse energy loss to our order, the order
which includes the constant terms under the leading Coulomb logarithm. The diﬀerence
between this independently calculated quantity and its evaluation using the Fokker-Planck
equation tells us when the Fokker-Planck description starts to break down.

A. Energy and Momentum Transfer Rates

As we have stated, the coeﬃcients C kl

b are constrained to produce the energy and momen-
tum exchange between the charged particle and the background plasma particles of species b.
To bring this out, we ﬁrst examine the general case of the transport of some general quantity
q(p). Averaging over the momentum deﬁnes a time dependent spatial density

and ﬂux vector

The Fokker-Planck equation (4.1) then expresses (∂/∂t)

partial integration, we may write the result in the form

The sign convention has been chosen so that dQb/dt represents the rate at which the quantity
ﬂows from the projectile to the plasma medium.

To bring out the meaning of dQb/dt, we note that the Fokker-Planck equation keeps the

total particle number

constant in time. Thus

deﬁnes a time-dependent, average value of the property q. We integrate the local transport
equation (4.4) over all space. The spatial divergence of the ﬂux term on the left-hand side
of Eq. (4.4) is thus removed, and in view of the deﬁnitions (4.2) and (4.7) we have

If we now assume that the distribution function f is sharply peaked about a point in phase
spaced, at some deﬁnite value (rp,pp), then we may evaluate dQb/dt at this phase space
point and take it out of the integral to get

Therefore, as stated, our sign convention has been chosen so that dQb/dt is the rate of increase
of the quantity from the swarm of particles determined by f into the plasma species b.

Let us now apply these general considerations to the projectile energy and momentum.
As we shall see, we will get two constraints that completely determine the scattering tensor
C kl
b . In this way we obtain a transport equation that accounts for the secular, long-term
build up of the changes in the velocity of a charged particle moving in a medium, a transport
equation with no long or short distance divergences. First we consider the energy density

B. Decomposition of the Collision Tensor

The collision terms in the Boltzmann or Lenard-Balescu equation do not involve gradients
of spatial variation. Hence the only available vector with which the Fokker-Planck collision
tensor C kl
b can be constructed is the particle momentum p = mv. This tensor therefore has
the general structure16

16The appearance of the tensor ǫklm ˆvm is forbidden by parity invariance. Note that the unit
vector ˆv, the direction of the velocity, is not well-deﬁned in the limit of vanishing velocity, v
0.
On the other hand, the tensor C kl
is well deﬁned in this limit of small velocity. Hence a low speed

The structure of the Fokker-Planck equation guarantees that a swarm of particles with a

C. Sharply Peaked Distributions: Projectiles

Throughout this work we will often take the distribution function f to be sharply

peaked in phase space, for example, a distribution peaked about a speciﬁc momentum value
pp = mpvp. Now, for clarity we write the projectile mass as mp rather than m. Another
useful case is when f is peaked only about the momentum direction ˆvp and there is no
restriction on the absolute value of the momentum itself. For either of these two cases, the
swarm of particles distributed by f will be called a beam of projectiles, and momentum
integrals can be performed by the substitutions v
ˆvp respectively. Finally, as
in the preceding example (4.6)-(4.9), we might also consider the distribution function f to
be sharply peaked in space as well, about a speciﬁc point rp, in which case we can evaluate
spatial integrals by the substitution r

vp and ˆv

1. Transverse Energy

Expression (4.20) gives a direct connection between the rate of energy transfer and the
coeﬃcient
Bb and
Ab, in contrast to Eq’s. (4.22) which provide an implicit relation between
the rate of momentum transfer. In the case of a sharply peaked particle beam, however,
Bb and the rate of transverse energy
there is also a simple connection between the coeﬃcient
ﬂow. As in the second case described in the previous paragraph, we consider a distribution
f that is sharply peaked in the momentum or velocity direction ˆvp, and deﬁne the transverse
energy as

Here we have placed an F-P designation on the ﬁnal result because we will later evaluate
this transfer rate exactly within our general order of calculation. The comparison of the two
results provides a signal for the breakdown of the Fokker-Planck equation when larger angle
collisions become important, collisions that are not accurately described by the Fokker-
Planck approximation. As should be expected, we ﬁnd in Section VI that the diﬀerence
between the Fokker-Planck evaluation (4.28) of the rate of transverse energy transfer and
the exact rate to our order of accuracy has no large Coulomb logarithm. That is, the
diﬀerence is of relative order of one-over the Coulomb logarithm. We should also hasten to
mention that in general the transverse spreading of a particle beam is a small eﬀect and so,
in general, the transverse error is a small error in a small eﬀect.

2. Velocity Fluctuations

We have determined the Fokker-Planck coeﬃcient functions C kl

b by the conditions that
they correctly describe the rate of energy and momentum transfer between the background
plasma components b and an arbitrary distribution of test particles or projectiles. An alter-
native approach was emphasized some time ago by Rosenbluth, MacDonald, and Judd [15].
To make contact with this line of development, we consider a distribution function f peaked

17To make our sign conventions explicit, we note that: we have deﬁned dE/dt and dP/dt as
the time rate of energy and momentum transferred to the background plasma from the moving
projectile. Thus, as the projectile slows down, dE/dt and v
dP/dt are positive. On the other
hand, Eq. (4.28) deﬁnes that rate of transverse energy given to the particle by its interactions with
the plasma. Thus dE⊥/dt is positive as the projectile slows down. Moreover, Eq. (4.29) describes
/dt is negative as the projectile
the change in the average velocity of the projectile and so

slows.

spatial extent of the projectile distribution f is small in comparison with the scale over
which the plasma properties vary so that C kl
is adequately evaluated at the mean position
b
rp. Since our concern here is with velocity variations, we shall simplify the discussion by
assuming that the background plasma is spatially uniform so that the spatial coordinate
dependence of C kl
b can be entirely neglected. More to the point, the result requires that the
squared spread in velocity ∆v2 is small in comparison with the squared velocity v2 itself,
so that C kl
= vp. Here and in subsequent work, we
neglect the distinction between vp and

This is of the form advocated by Rosenbluth et al. [15], a from also described by Trubnikov
[16]. These authors work with a completely arbitrary background plasma, a plasma which

has no aspects of thermal equilibrium. Thus in their work, there is no relationship between
the time rates of change of the average velocity and the squared velocity ﬂuctuation. In our

case, however, where we assume that the various plasma species b are individually in thermal
equilibrium at temperature Tb = 1/βb, the vector d

ﬂow determines the coeﬃcients C kl

V. TRANSVERSE SPREADING, LONGITUDINAL STRAGGLING

We turn now to investigate in more detail the nature and eﬀects of the spreading in

velocity as a projectile moves in the plasma. Although the condition of a small velocity
spread can be imposed so that it is obeyed initially, it may fail at later times.

In principle, Eq. (4.29) may be solved to determine

v
as a function of time. With this
h
solution inserted in C kl
b , Eq. (4.32) may then, in principle, be integrated to determine the

As we have just discussed, for ions dE⊥/dt is of relative order me/mp and can be neglected,
so that the energy loss rate completely determines the slowing down of the particle.

Since the logarithm is a slowly varying function, as the projectile slows down from very

high velocities to speeds that are more nearly of the order of the thermal velocity, it acquires
velocity ﬂuctuations in the longitudinal direction that are only slightly larger than ¯vp. This
justiﬁes the integration of the slowing down equations (5.11) and (5.12) from very high

spreading is relatively very small. However, this simple picture of the essentially deterministic
motion of an individual particle breaks down when the particle speed approaches the thermal

employed as the proper description. The Fokker-Planck equation can be used to describe the
time evolution of the phase space density f (r, p, t), and our computation of the coeﬃcients
C kl
b that enter into the Fokker-Planck equation remain valid. What breaks down is the single-
particle description of a particle losing well deﬁned amounts of energy and momentum.

What we have just said means that whenever 1/βbmpv2

p corrections become important,
the notion of a well-deﬁned projectile trajectory breaks down. Hence the corrections given
in the second part of Eq. (4.20) are never relevant for the description of a single particle

which, in any relevant region, is described by

(5.13)

which also determines the complete motion of the particle. Nonetheless, we have used the
form (5.13) in all of our calculations of dE/dx = (1/vp) dE/dt.

We have noted that the transverse spreading of an electron projectile may be signiﬁcant,
even for fast particles. To emphasize this point, we quote the high speed limits for the total

and perpendicular energy loss of an electron that follow from Eq’s. (10.43) and (10.45):

For the plasma parameters that we have used above, ln(T /~ωe) is not a large (or small)

slow down along a straight line. The electron motion in a plasma requires the use of a
Fokker-Planck description of an ensemble of particles.

VI. VALIDITY RANGE OF THE TRANSPORT EQUATION

The exact — to our order — rate at which the transverse energy of a projectile increases

is the sum of the leading ν < 3 result computed from the Lenard-Balescu equation plus the
leading ν > 3 result computed from the Boltzmann equation. The diﬀerence of this with the
evaluation (4.28) given by the Fokker-Planck equation provides a signal for the breakdown
of the Fokker-Planck description. This measure is

It is worthwhile providing here the results of this assessment, detailed in Sec. XI below,
so as to conclude our general review in a uniﬁed manner. But before presenting these results,

some general remarks may help clarify what we are doing. We have used the two functions

the transport tensor C kl

P label. The point is that, within the Fokker-Planck approximation,
we denote by the F
only two of the three functions v
dPb/dt, dEb/dt, and dE⊥/dt are independent functions.
However, if the Fokker-Planck approximation is not made, then these three functions are
linearly independent functions. The diﬀerence (6.1) is thus a measure of the error in the
Fokker-Planck description.

Since the ν < 3 contribution to the Fokker-Planck coeﬃcient C kl

As far as the transverse spreading is concerned, this shows, at least at high energy, that
the Fokker-Planck description is valid only to leading logarithmic order: The validity of the

transverse spreading given by the Fokker-Planck equation is valid to the accuracy to which
the Coulomb logarithm is large in comparison to unity. It must immediately be remarked,

however, that, in the high-energy limit, the rate of energy loss

is much larger that the rate of transverse spreading, larger by the very large ion/electron
mass ratio mb/me. Thus the spreading entails very small angles, and one can tolerate a
rather large error in this small eﬀect.

In general, the error ∆b is smaller than the transverse energy spread itself by a factor
of one over the Coulomb logarithm. To see this, we may, for example, turn to Eq. (9.5).
It contains a logarithm whose factor K in its argument cancels against that in another

contribution to yield the large Coulomb logarithm [with a quantum or classical cutoﬀ as is
appropriate to the velocity vp.] Thus the leading Coulomb logarithm contribution to the
Fokker-Planck transverse energy rate (6.6) is given by

Our sign conventions, in which dEb/dt is the rate of energy loss of plasma species b, while
dE⊥ b is rate of transverse energy gain of species b, dictate the relative minus sign above.
The low speed limit of dEb/dt for ν = 3, as computed by Eq’s. (4.20) and (9.9), is indeed
just the factor (3/2) times the result (6.10) for dE⊥ b/dt. On other other hand, the result
(6.10) is quite diﬀerent than the low speed limit (6.5) of the error ∆b which behaves as v2
p
when vp →
0, not as a constant as given in Eq. (6.10). Thus, the Fokker-Planck equation
gives a very accurate description of the transverse spreading of low velocity particles.

We turn now to the details of our calculation.

VII. LONG DISTANCE EFFECTS DOMINATE WHEN ν < 3

When the spatial dimensions are less than three, long-distance, collective eﬀects are
dominant. This “soft physics” is described to leading order in the plasma density by the
Lenard [6]–Balescu [7] equation.20 Indeed, to leading order in the density, one can prove that
the rigorous BBGKY hierarchy reduces to the Lenard–Balescu equation when ν < 3. This
can be demonstrated, for example, by carefully examining the discussion given in Nicholson

[20] or in Clemmow and Dougherty [10].
It is signiﬁcant that the proof of the reduction
of the BBGKY hierarchy to the Lenard–Balescu equation breaks down at precisely ν = 3:

this happens because of the appearance of short-distance, ultra-violet divergences, which are
absent in dimensions less than three.

20Again we note that Refs. [10,19,20] contain well written expositions.

C. Asymptotic Results for Large and Small Velocity

The asymptotic forms of our results for large and small projectile velocities vp are of
interest. Here we shall work out these limits for the regular terms. The corresponding limits
for the singular terms are much easier to compute once they are combined with the singular

terms produced from the ν > 3 calculation, and so we defer this until later on.

To obtain the small velocity behavior of the dielectric function, we ﬁrst add and subtract

To obtain the large projectile velocity limit of the

b,R coeﬃcient, we ﬁrst note
that the numerator and each term in the denominator of the spectral weight ratio
ρb(vp cos θ)/ρtotal(vp cos θ) [where ρb and ρtotal are deﬁned in Eq’s. (7.10) and (7.9)] con-
tains a factor exp
. In view of the very small electron/ion mass ratio, these
exponential factors approach 0 much faster for ions than for electrons in the vp → ∞
limit.
Thus the spectral weight ratio is very small except for the case in which the index b refers
to the electron, b = e, for which case we have

To obtain this large velocity limit, we ﬁrst replace the spectral weight ratio by unity in
formula (7.26). We then write cos θ = z in Eq. (7.26) and note that since the integrand
is analytic in the upper-half z plane, we may deform the original integration along the
1 < z < +1 portion of the real axis into a semicircle of unit radius in the upper-half z

VIII. SHORT DISTANCE EFFECTS DOMINANT WHEN ν > 3:
CLASSICAL CASE

To the leading order in the plasma density with which we are concerned, the Boltzmann
equation correctly describes the Coulomb interactions in the plasma for spatial dimensions
ν larger than three. Again one can prove that, to leading order in the plasma density, the
rigorous BBGKY hierarchy reduces to the Boltzmann equation when the spatial dimension
exceeds three.27 The Boltzmann equation for the phase-space density fa(pa) of species a

Here, although at this stage the scattering process is taken to be purely classical, a quantum-

27This can be established by carefully examining, for example, the discussion of the derivation of
the Boltzmann equation from the BBGKY hierarchy given in Sec. 3.5 of Huang [18]. The derivation
breaks down at ν = 3 because of the long range of the Coulomb force.

28The roles of the factors of Planck’s constant ~ that appear in Eq. (8.2) are worth pointing
out. It suﬃces to consider the factors associated with the ﬁrst product of phase-space densities in
the square brackets in Eq. (8.2). The two factors of ~−ν that appear in the ﬁrst two integration

b, with the scattering amplitude T (W, q2) depending on
the center-of-mass energy W and the squared momentum transfer q2. It is convenient to
employ this quantum-mechanical notation even for classical scattering for several reasons.
It explicitly displays the complete kinematical character of a scattering process, including
the detailed balance symmetry.
It explicitly shows that the Boltzmann equation may be
generalized to an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions ν. It connects the collision term
explicitly with the cross section generalized to ν dimensions as shown in Eq. (8.8) below.
Finally, it shows that the collision term (8.2) vanishes when all the particles are in thermal
equilibrium with the generic densities f (p)
because of the conservation of
energy enforced by the delta function.

A. Projectile Motion in an Equilibrium Plasma

The transport of energy, momentum, and transverse energy was discussed at the start
of Sec. IV. To do this in terms of the Boltzmann equation, we ﬁrst review the standard
treatment for the sake of clarity and completeness, and to establish our notation. In general,
we deal with a momentum-dependent quantity q(p) which gives a spatial density for species
a as

volume elements are the factors of ~ that appear even in purely classical statistical mechanics. They
change the dimension of dνp′ to that of an inverse volume (in a ν-dimensional space) so that the
momentum integral of f (p′) becomes a particle number density. The remaining factor of ~−ν in
the dνpb measure just cancels the conventional factor of ~ν associated with the total-momentum-
conserving delta function. Since the dimension of δ(x) is x−1, the single factor of ~ associated with
the energy-conserving delta function produces a quantity with the dimensions of time. So far, we
have the dimension count L−2ν T . The ﬁnal factor to be examined is the scattering amplitude. To
obtain its dimensions and its overall ~ dependence, we consider the ﬁrst Born approximation result
T = ~−1 ˜V (q/~), where ˜V is the Fourier transform of the potential and q is the momentum transfer
in the scattering. Thus the scattering amplitude has the dimensions T −1 Lν, and we conclude that
the collision term Cab(pa) has the dimensions of a rate, T −1, as it must. As we shall later see
explicitly, all the factors of Planck’s constant ~ cancel in the classical limit save for those that
convert the two momentum integrals of the phase-space densities into number densities, the ~
factors that appear even in classical statistical mechanics.

The sum involves collisions with the other particle species in the plasma. Thus, we have
an unambiguous identiﬁcation of the rate of transfer to each species b in the plasma. The
scattering amplitude, delta functions, and momentum integrations in the collision term are

. Henceforth we use the > superscript to emphasize that this is the leading result
for ν > 3. Except that we work in a space of arbitrary dimensionality ν, the result (8.9) is
the familiar one: The rate of change of a quantity is its change in a collision times the rate
of these collisions — which is given by the cross section folded over the incident ﬂux values.
In this form, rather than the change of the quantity brought about by the scattering into

vpb = vp −

and out of a momentum region as described by the Boltzmann collision term, a relabeling
of variables expresses the rate of change in terms of the change in each collision. The result
(8.9) expresses the rate in an obvious form, but it does not make manifest the fact that the
rate (8.9) for a quantity that is conserved in the collision vanishes when integrated over a
thermal, Boltzmann distribution with the same temperature of the plasma.

B. Classical Coulomb Scattering

For the remainder of this Section we shall treat only the case of classical scattering. We

defer the discussion of quantum-mechanical corrections to a later Section.

1. Cross Section Integral

We now apply the energy loss formula to the case of classical Coulomb scattering which
results from the reduction of the classical BBGKY hierarchy. In ν dimensions, the element
of diﬀerential classical cross section is given by

dσC

pb = Ων−2 bν−2db ,

where Ων−2 is the area of the unit ν

where θ(b) is the scattering angle as a function of b in ν dimensions. The classical planar tra-

ν. Thus the familiar formula for the scattering angle

For ﬁnite impact parameters, no divergence appears if we simply sent ν = 3. In this case,
the integral in Eq. (8.37) gives θ(b) = 2 tan−1 ξ(b), and with ν = 3 in the deﬁnition (8.38) of
ξ(b), one ﬁnds the well-known result for Rutherford scattering,

Taking into account our results for q2 at ν = 3 and arbitrary but ﬁnite b, Eq. (8.43), and

at large b but arbitrary ν, Eq. (8.41), we arrive at an interpolation formula

ν = 3 :

q2(b) =

2. Classical Coeﬃcients

We turn now to compute the transport coeﬃcients when the classical cross section (8.48)
is placed in the general result (8.30). To do this, it is convenient to use the velocity variables
vp and vb, with p = mpb vpb and vpb = vp −
vb. The classical cross section (8.48) produces
the factor p−1p2(ν−3)/(ν−2) or

As Eq. (8.30) shows, the

IX. CLASSICAL RESULTS

The ν > 3 contributions (8.62) we have just computed and the ν < 3 contributions of

Eq. (7.24) are each separately divergent in the ν
3 spatial limit. However, it follows from
the general principle of our dimensional continuation that their sum is well deﬁned in the
limit30, combinations we denote by

It is worthwhile emphasizing again that this provides the leading and next-to-leading
contributions to the classical stopping power in the plasma coupling g. The lower-dimensional
contributions (<) have several pieces, Eqs. (7.24)–(7.26). They consist of the sum of singular

terms, Eq. (7.25), and regular pieces, Eq. (7.26). Note that it is redundant to employ a

30In this regard, it is worth noting that as the spatial dimensions change, the physical dimensions
e2 µ(ν−3). Now the wave number
of a charge e2 change. This is made explicit if we replace e2
µ carries the dimensional change in the original deﬁnition of the squared charge. The fact that
the singular pole terms cancel implies that the complete result is independent of what precise
numerical value is taken for the arbitrary wave number µ; the result is insensitive to the way in
which the squared charge is extrapolated away from three dimensions. This is the analog, within
our dimensional continuation method, to the renormalization group invariance of quantum ﬁeld
theory.

classical subscript in the ν < 3 case, as we did for the ν > 3 piece, since all contributions in
dimensions less than three are purely classical.

Since the regular piece is ﬁnite and has already been reduced to its simplest form, let us

concentrate on the sum of the singular pieces, and write

The subscript S on the left-hand side of Eq. (9.3) should not be taken to indicate that the
limit of the sum is singular, but only that the result comes from the well-deﬁned sum of
individually singular pieces. The ν
3 limit is well deﬁned, as the respective pole terms
cancel. The ﬁrst term was derived in (8.62), and is dominant for ν > 3, while the second
term is dominant for ν < 3 and is given by (7.28), which we repeat here for convenience:

X. QUANTUM CORRECTIONS

A. Quantum Scattering in the Born Approximation

No dimensionless parameter can be formed from the basic quantities epeb , mpb , and vpb
that describe the classical scattering. Hence dimensional analysis determines all of the
classical result (8.48) except for the purely numerical factors that it contains. Quantum-

mechanical scattering, on the other hand, is richer in that it involves the dimensionless
parameter

ηpb =

epeb
4π ~ vpb

p
π~

ν−3

,

(10.1)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)
where vpb = p/mpb is the velocity of the projectile relative to a particle of species b in the
plasma. We have previously made use of this parameter in the ν = 3 limit. The factor
(p/π~)(ν−3) that disappears when ν = 3 is introduced to make ηpb dimensionless when the
spatial dimensionality ν is extended away from ν = 3.32 The quantum-mechanical exten-
sion of the classical squared momentum-transfer cross section (8.48) involves a dimensionless

32Apart from three dimensions, the Coulomb potential, being the ν-dimensional Fourier transform
of 1/k2, behaves as 1/r(ν−2). Hence e2/r(ν−2) has the dimensions of energy. Since Planck’s con-
stant ~ has dimensions of momentum times distance or, equivalently energy times time, an inverse
distance has the dimensions p/~ while ~v has the dimensions of energy times distance. We conclude
that Eq. (10.1) does indeed deﬁne a dimensionless parameter for arbitrary spatial dimensionality
ν. The additional factor of π in (p/π~)(ν−3) is introduced for later convenience.

76

function of the dimensionless parameter ηpb. This parameter, which describes short-distance,
quantum-mechanical eﬀects, cannot appear to leading order in the long-distance physics
which is involved in the ν < 3 process evaluated in Sec. VII. It can, however, enter into and
correct the short-distance scattering process with which we are now concerned. Although
the quantum-mechanical description that we now turn to is strictly outside of the derivation
of the Boltzmann equation from the classical BBGKY hierarchy, it is clear from physical
grounds that quantum mechanics must be employed when ηpb is small, which formally cor-
responds to a limit in which Planck’s constant ~ becomes large. In the limit in which the
projectile velocity vp becomes small and the η parameter is large, the previous classical limit
must be employed. Otherwise, a quantum-mechanical treatment of the scattering in ν > 3
must be made.

We turn now to evaluate the scattering factor (8.15) multiplied by q2 when ηpb is small
and the quantum-mechanical Born approximation result is appropriate. This gives the ex-
treme quantum-mechanical limit that applies for very high projectile velocities. We shall
soon bridge the gap between the quantum Born and the classical results. In the Born ap-
proximation,

B. Full Quantum Correction

To ﬁll in the region of arbitrary ηab values, we consider the weighting of the squared
momentum transfer with the diﬀerence between the complete and ﬁrst Born approximation
cross sections,

(dσ

dσB) q2 .

−

Z

(10.8)

→

→

This integral of a cross section diﬀerence is well behaved in the limit ν
3. The pole at
ν = 3 produced by the integral involving the full cross section is canceled by an identical pole
in the integral involving the Born approximation. This is because these poles come from soft,
infrared physics corresponding to long distances where the potential is weak. The divergence
behavior leading to the poles is produced entirely by the ﬁrst Born approximation term of the
full cross section dσ which is then canceled by the subtraction of its Born approximation dσB.
However, we cannot simply set the spatial dimension ν = 3 in the cross section diﬀerence
that is the integrand in the integral (10.8) because in three dimensions the Born and full
Coulomb cross section elements are identical, dσ = dσB. The ν
3 limit of the integral
is not the integral of the ν
3 limit of the integrand. The integral does not converge
uniformly at small scattering angles, and the order of the limits cannot be interchanged.
What we shall do is to implicitly assume that the spatial dimensionality is slightly greater
than three so as to regulate the theory33. Then we shall make a (implicitly generalized)
partial wave expansion for the cross section diﬀerence (10.8). High partial waves with l
1
correspond to large impact parameter scattering where the eﬀect of the potential is weak
and the ﬁrst Born approximation becomes exact34. Thus the subtraction of the ﬁrst Born
approximation within a partial wave decomposition yields a partial wave sum that converges
at large l values and hence gives no pole at ν = 3 when the physical limit of three dimensions
is taken. Thus all we really need do is to express everything in terms of partial waves in
three dimensions and subtract the Born approximation in the partial wave summand. In
this way we may exploit some clever mathematics of Lindhard and Sorensen [29], but in a
manner which justiﬁes its use. It should be emphasized that the Born approximation must
be subtracted in the partial wave summand before the sum is performed — the separate
sums do not converge at large l.

≫

→

33Other infrared regularizations may be used, such as the replacement of the Coulomb potential
with a screened Debye potential, since only a potential logarithmic divergence is to be avoided.

34At large angular momentum, the eﬀective centrifugal potential is much larger than the Coulomb
potential, justifying the treatment of the Coulomb potential by the ﬁrst Born approximation.

78

Although we always have in mind that the Born term is to be subtracted, for simplicity
we shall omit this explicit subtraction in some intermediate steps. We use the standard

partial wave decomposition of the scattering amplitude,

35Appendix D explains how the cross section averaged momentum transfer (10.13) is simply related
to the classical limit.

36This formula for the Coulomb partial wave phase shift is derived in many graduate level quantum
mechanics texts. See, for example, Gottfried [30], Sec. 17, Landau and Lifshitz [31], Sec. 36, or
Schwinger [32], Sec. 9.2. The connection of the Coulomb phase function to that of the Debye
potential, and the recovery of the Coulomb result in the inﬁnite screening radius limit, has been
presented by Brown [33] using determintal methods and Jost functions.

This expression provides a small correction when the integration is dominated by regions in
which the quantum Coulomb parameter ηpb is large so that the scattering is nearly classical.
When the eﬀective ηpb values are of order unity, then a detailed evaluation of Eq. (10.27) is
called for. But there are some limits in which Eq. (10.27) simpliﬁes.

C. Simpliﬁcations and Asymptotic Limits

One simpliﬁcation appears for cold plasmas, that is, plasmas for which the thermal speed
vT =
. In this limit
the ﬁrst exponential in Eq. (10.27) sets vpb = vp in the factors that multiply it, the second
exponential gives a negligible contribution, and so Eq. (10.27) becomes,

3/βbmb can be neglected. This is described by the formal limit βb → ∞

The other simpliﬁcation appears when the thermal velocity vT or vp or both are large in

the starting point (10.24) and evaluate it in the manner of the evaluation of the classical

error of the Fokker-Planck equation as measured by diﬀerent evaluations of the increase in
transverse energy. Again we note that since the ν < 3 contribution to the Fokker-Planck

XII. RATE AT WHICH DIFFERENT SPECIES COME INTO EQUILIBRIUM

Plasmas may be created that contain diﬀerent species which are at diﬀerent temperatures.
This happens, for example, when a plasma experiences a laser pulse which preferentially heats
the light electrons that have the larger scattering cross section. Here we use the methods

that we have developed to compute the rate at which the various plasma species come into
thermal equilibrium.

A. Introduction and Summary

We shall assume that the particles of two species a and b in the plasma are individually in
thermal equilibrium, but at diﬀerent temperatures Ta and Tb. We shall compute the leading

89

and subleading orders, as we have done throughout, of the rate d
density

Ea of species a changes because of its interaction with species b. Since

Since the energy loss of one plasma species is another’s gain, the rate of energy density
transfer is skew-symmetric,

are symmetric coeﬃcients.

m
A plasma consists of light electrons of mass me = m and heavy ions of mass mi ≫
which we shall generically denote by M. Before plunging into the details of our computations,
we review the well-known justiﬁcation for assuming that the electrons and ions in the plasma
are themselves in internal thermal equilibrium at the separate temperatures Te and Ti. To
do this, we note that, as shown for example in Eq. (12.25) in the results below, the mass

dependence of the rate appears predominately in

√mamb

Cab =

−

(maTb + mbTa)3/2 · · ·

.

Let us now use this result to compute the rate at which the electrons come into equilibrium
with themselves. For this purpose, we imagine the very simple situation in which the elec-
trons are in two pieces, one with temperature Ta, the other with temperature Tb. Then the
rate at which these two pieces come into equilibrium is controlled by the factor

1
(Ta + Tb)3/2 m1/2 .

(12.1)

(12.2)

(12.3)

(12.4)

(12.5)

(12.6)

(12.7)

If a similar partition of the ions into two parts at diﬀerent temperatures were made, the
parts would come into equilibrium at a rate controlled by the factor

m/M
Thus the rate at which the ions come into equilibrium amongst themselves is a factor
slower than the corresponding rate for the electrons. Now going back to our original problem
of electrons and ions at diﬀerent temperatures Te and Ti, we see that if the temperatures
are not greatly diﬀerent, the rate at which the two species come into thermal equilibrium is
controlled by the factor

p

1
(Ta + Tb)3/2 M 1/2 .

m1/2
(Te)3/2 M

,

which is a factor of m/M smaller than the rate at which the electrons come into equilibrium
m/M smaller than the equilibrium rate for the ions alone.
amongst themselves and a factor
Thus our work which treats the electrons and ions as being in separate thermal equilibrium
but with two diﬀerent temperatures and concentrating on computing the rate at which the
ions and electrons come into thermal equilibrium is justiﬁed by the very large ion – electron
mass ratio.

p

species have equilibrated to a common ion temperature Ti. With electron and ion speciﬁc

APPENDIX A: SIMPLE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATING THE METHOD

Since the method used in this work is a novel one, we include in this Appendix a pedagog-
ical, simple mathematical example that illustrates the basic idea. This is the computation
of the behavior of the modiﬁed Hankel function Kν(z) in the small argument z limit with
the index ν also small. The argument z will play the role of the small parameter in our
work; the index ν will play the role of the dimensionality except that in this simple Bessel
function example we shall examine the region where ν is near zero, not three. This example
already appears in the preliminary account [9] of the new use of dimensional continuation,
but it worth repeating here so as to have a clear, self-contained presentation.

The Hankel function has the integral representation

Although k is simply a dummy integration variable, it is convenient to think of it as a wave
number or momentum variable. When z is small, exp
may be replaced by 1
z k/2
except when one or the other of the factors exp
is needed to make
the k integration converge in the neighborhood of one of its end points. When ν is slightly
less than zero, the integral (A1) is dominated by the small k, “infrared or long-distance”,
region. In this case, only the exp
factor is needed to provide convergence, and we

The variable change k = z/(2t) places this integral in the form of the standard representation

The result (A3) for ν < 0 can be analytically continued into the region ν > 0. In this
region it involves a higher power of z than that which appears in the other evaluation (A5),

and hence this analytic continuation of the leading result for ν < 0 into the region ν > 0
becomes subleading here. Similarly, the result (A5) for ν > 0 may be analytically continued

into the region ν < 0 where it now becomes subleading. An examination of the deﬁning
integral representation (A1) shows that these subleading analytic continuation terms are, in
fact, the dominant, ﬁrst-subleading terms.39 For ν > 0 one term is leading and the other
subleading, while for ν < 0 their roles are interchanged. Thus their sum

such an extraction of the subdominant terms would be very diﬃcult indeed, although perhaps
possible in principle.

APPENDIX B: CONVERGENT KINETIC EQUATIONS

Convergent Boltzmann transport equations have been discussed by Frieman and Book
[11], Weinstock [12], and by Gould and DeWitt [8]. These are equations of the usual Boltz-
mann equation form, but with modiﬁed collision terms on the right-hand side that account
for both the hard, short-distance collisions and the soft, infrared, long-distance scattering
that is modiﬁed by the background plasma medium. Just as in our work, these equations are
valid only to leading order in the plasma density. In this appendix, we shall describe these
convergent kinetic equations and then sketch how they are equivalent to our method which
uses dimensional continuation. But before passing to these details, we should again note
that our method gives only the correct leading order terms with no spurious higher-order
terms. This simplicity of computation is to be contrasted with the kinetic equation approach
which does yield spurious higher-order terms that must be identiﬁed and discarded to obtain
a consistent, leading-order result.

Let us ﬁrst recall that the collision integral in the Boltzmann equation is of the generic

form (8.2), which may be written as

We now give a quick proof that the ‘convergent kinetic equation’ is equivalent to our
method of dimensional continuation provided that the kinetic equation is solved in a consis-

tent fashion and spurious, higher-order terms are discarded. To do this, we take the hard
Coulomb scattering part in Eq. (B2) to be deﬁned by the dimensional continuation with

ν > 3, as indicated in the discussion of Eq. (B8). We take the soft part in Eq. (B2) to be
divided as in Eq. (B9) with the ﬁrst term with the over bar written in the Lenard-Balescu

form. We then extend this Lenard-Balescu part to ν < 3 so that its dynamically screened
and Debye screened pieces may be treated separately. We thus have

APPENDIX C: FOKKER-PLANCK AND LENARD-BALESCU
LIMITS FROM BOLTZMANN EQUATION

In general, if the squared scattering amplitude in the collision integral (B1) decreases
suﬃciently rapidly at large momenta, or if the dimension ν is suﬃciently small such that the
phase-space volume at high energies becomes small, then the collision integral (B1) may be
replaced by an equation of the Lenard-Balescu form.

The Lenard-Balescu equation is a classical equation. The mechanical momentum transfer

q and classical wave number k have the familiar relation

q = ~ k .

(C1)

It is the wave number k that is the signiﬁcant variable in the scattering amplitude, while
the momentum q appears in kinematical and phase space factors. The classical limit is the
limit ~
0 in kinematical factors in which
the momentum role is emphasized. This limit of small q in the kinematical factors in the
Boltzmann equation produces the Fokker-Planck equation, to whose derivation we now turn.

For a Galilean invariant theory, the scattering amplitude depends only upon the squared
momentum transfer q2 and the (relative) energy in the center-of-mass W . By virtue of the
conservation of energy [which is enforced by the delta function that remains in Eq. (C3)]
this energy may be expressed in terms of either initial or ﬁnal state variables,

As we have remarked above, the squared wave number k2 is the relevant variable for the
case that we are now considering rather than the momentum transfer q2 = ~2 k2. The usual
form of the Boltzmann equation involves a squared scattering amplitude that is Galilean
invariant and thus only a function of W and k2. However, we need to generalize this a
little to take into account the plasma screening corrections that are included in the Lenard-
Balescu limit of the Boltzmann equation. The background plasma speciﬁes a rest-frame
coordinate system, and so non-Galilean invariant variables may now also appear in the
scattering amplitude. Since the system remains rotationally invariant, the only remaining
variables involve the kinetic energies of the reacting particles. As we shall shortly see, the
only relevant combination is the energy diﬀerence of the initial and ﬁnal states of a particle
as measured in the plasma rest frame. Since the total energy is conserved in the collision
integral (C3), there is only one energy diﬀerence

As we have often remarked, the Lenard-Balescu equation is valid only for dimensions

less than three, ν < 3. This reduced dimensionality is necessary for the convergence of
the wave number integration at large k.
In three dimensions, the dynamically screened
Coulomb scattering amplitude does not vanish suﬃciently rapidly at large q = ~k so as to
permit the ~ expansion that we have made. If, however, the squared Debye Born amplitude
is subtracted as in Eq. (B10), then the Lenard-Balescu reduction may be made directly in
three dimensions. Indeed, as we have repeatedly emphasized, this reduction must be made to
consistently compute only the leading terms. Since the only kinematical variables available
are momentum variables, the ﬁrst correction, which is of order ~2, must appear in the form
of a squared length λ2 = ~2/p2. A dimensionless ratio can only be obtained by multiplication
with the Debye wave number. Hence the ﬁrst correction to the leading classical limit that
we have just derived is of order42 λ2 κ2
D. This is formally of order of the plasma density
n relative to the leading order result, a correction that is beyond the order to which we
compute. Having said all this, one can now continue the Lenard-Balescu like equation in

three dimensions for the subtracted squared amplitude (B10) to ν < 3. The two parts of the
equation can then be separately treated as done in the previous Appendix B.

Lifshitz and Pitaevskii [26] purport to derive the Fokker-Planck equation from the Boltz-
mann equation for a dilute system of very heavy particles moving in a gas of light particles.
Since our work might be confused as having some relationship to theirs, we brieﬂy review
it here. For the sake of completeness, we shall show that their work requires further ap-

proximations to become internally consistent. This we do by providing an explicit example.
But before starting out to do this, we should again emphasize that our reduction of the
Boltzmann equation starts from the assumption that the scattering is restricted to small
momentum transfers because of the dynamics of the scattering cross section. Lifshitz and
Pitaevskii, on the other hand, assume that the momentum transfer is small because of the
kinematics of a heavy particle moving in a light gas.

First we transcribe the description of Lifshitz and Pitaevskii into our notation. They

write the collision integral in the form

Cab(pa) =

wab(pa + q, q) fa(pa + q)

wab(pa, q) fa(pa)

.

(C18)

The “projectile” particle a is assumed to be heavy, and the “gas” particle b is assumed to
be light. Comparing this structure with our standard form (B1) and performing one of the

momentum integrals trivially using the momentum-conserving delta function gives

wab(pa) =

vb is the relative velocity with va = pa/ma, vb = pb/mb, and
Here, as before, vab = va −
mab is the reduced mass. Lifshitz and Pitaevskii expand Eq. (C18) in powers of q when this
momentum transfer appears added to the heavy particle momentum pa and retain terms up
to second order. This formal expansion gives the approximate collision term

It is easy to see that the approximate collision term (C20) vanishes when the heavy particle

As we shall see, the satisfaction of this constraint requires further approximation. In this
sense, the work of Lifshitz and Pitaevskii is misleading.

The easiest and clearest way to demonstrate this is to consider an explicit example.
We examine the case in which the scattering amplitude T is a constant and the spatial
dimensionality is taken to be two, ν = 2. These restrictions lead to trivial integrals and
it is very easy to explicitly evaluate the expressions (C21) and (C22) using Eq. (C18) with
the distribution of the light gas particles fb(pb) of Maxwell-Boltzmann form at temperature
T = 1/β. The results are

where nb is the particle number density of the light gas particles, and

equilibrium constraint (C24). A consistent result requires the further approximation that
the “projectile” mass ma is much greater than the “gas” mass mb so that one can replace
mab/mb →
1. With this requirement obeyed, and assuming that the “projectile” speed is
not too great in the sense that the kinetic energy ma v2
a/2 is not much greater than the
temperature T , the second set of terms in Eq. (C26) may be neglected, and we see that the
thermal equilibrium constraint (C24) is now obeyed.

Be all this as it may, we must emphasize again that the Lifshitz-Pitaevskii treatment
is based on a kinematical restriction which is very diﬀerent than the dynamical condition
that we impose in order to reduce the Boltzmann equation to a Fokker-Planck equation and
ultimately obtain the Lenard-Balescu limit.

APPENDIX D: THE CLASSICAL LIMIT

Expression (10.13) for the cross section averaged momentum transfer is simply related to

the classical limit. To see how this goes, we write Eq. (10.13) as

dσ q2 = 2π~2

In the classical limit, large l-values dominate. Thus, with the identiﬁcation J = (l+1/2)~, the
sum may be replaced by an integral, ~2

by their WKB evaluation,

where E = p2/2m and rm is the turning point, the radial coordinate where the square root
vanishes. The classical scattering angle θ may be found in the usual way: The conservation
of the angular momentum J = mr2dθ/dt is used to replace the time increment dt in the
energy conservation equation by dt = mr2dθ/J. This gives the usual trajectory equation for
dr/dθ which may be integrated to evaluate the classical scattering angle as

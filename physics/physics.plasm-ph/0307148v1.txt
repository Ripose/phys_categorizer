ABSTRACT

The relativistic electromagnetic projection operators discovered by Fradkin are

used to obtain a covariant decomposition of the motion of a relativistic charged

particle into parallel motion and perpendicular gyration. The Lagrangian Lie

transform method of Littlejohn is used to achieve a transformation to guiding-

center coordinates in which the rapid oscillatory motion is removed. The natu-

ral guiding-center Poisson bracket structure and Hamiltonian are derived. The

guiding-center equations of motion are presented to one order higher than the

usual drifts, and the correction to the gyromomentum is given. Correspondence

with the usual noncovariant results, as given by Northrop, is demonstrated.

iii

iv

It is possible to add one or more eikonal wave perturbations to the La-

grangian action for a single particle before performing the guiding-center trans-

formation.

It is shown that such perturbations can be written in manifestly

gauge-invariant form in guiding-center coordinates; this observation allows us

to develop a manifestly gauge-invariant oscillation-center theory to arbitrarily

high order. In this way, again using Lagrangian Lie transforms, we obtain the

ponderomotive Hamiltonian.

By summing the guiding-center Lagrangian action over the full distribution

of guiding centers and adding the Maxwell action, we obtain the total action

of a guiding-center plasma. Upon variation of this total action, we ﬁnd a self-

consistent set of covariant relativistic kinetic and ﬁeld equations; from these we

can identify the guiding-center current density and the guiding-center magneti-

zation. Upon application of Noether’s theorem, the total action yields covariant

conservation laws for the momentum-energy and the angular momentum of a

relativistic guiding-center plasma; from these we can identify the guiding-center

stress-energy tensor and the guiding-center spin angular momentum tensor.

By summing the Lagrangian action for a guiding/oscillation center over the

full distribution and adding the Maxwell action, variation yields self-consistent

relativistic kinetic and ﬁeld equations for the plasma in the wave ﬁeld, including

the dispersion relation for the wave; from these we can identify the wave magne-

tization and susceptibility, thereby demonstrating the K-χ theorem. Noether’s

theorem then yields conservation laws for the guiding-center plasma in the pres-

ence of a wave ﬁeld, including the wave contribution to the stress-energy and

spin angular momentum tensors.

Acknowledgements

This thesis is the culmination of a six-year PhD program at the University of

California at Davis. During this period, I worked full-time as a plasma physicist

in the Magnetic Fusion Energy Division of the Lawrence Livermore National

Laboratory. Much of my research was carried out in collaboration with the

Plasma Theory group at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. All of this gives

rise to a long list of people to thank.

We’ll start with the personal one. . .

First, and foremost, I would like to thank my wife, Laura, for her love,

patience and support during the course of my research. Full-time employment

plus thesis research is a stressful combination, and I couldn’t have done it without

her.

Then comes the thesis committee. . .

More than anyone else, my thesis committee chairman, William A. Newcomb,

taught me how to think. I consider myself privileged to have had the beneﬁt of

Bill’s insights on a variety of topics (from physics, to mathematics, to philosophy,

to jogging). The precision of his thinking and the clarity of his explanations will

remain a role model for me throughout my career.

Most all of the research in this thesis was carried out with Allan Kaufman

vi

vii

and his Plasma Theory group at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Allan has

been the principal pioneer of the action principle formulation of plasma physics,

which is the main underlying theme of this thesis. He has the distinction of

being not only the founder of a new school of thought within plasma physics

that emphasizes a diﬀerential geometric approach to the classical problems of

the ﬁeld, but also of being the founder of a new school of plasma physicists

among whom I am proud to be included. Allan’s Socratic style of teaching

was indispensible in helping me think my way through the maze of concepts

encountered in the course of my research. He also taught me the importance of

a broadened perspective in physics research. As a result, I became familiar with

many areas of physics and mathematics to which I would not have otherwise

been exposed, and I was able to apply much of that knowledge in this thesis.

Gary Smith has been a source of learning and guidance for me from the very

beginning of my program of study. When one ﬁrst enters a ﬁeld as complex as

plasma physics, it is indispensible to have someone who is willing to act as a

tutor, answering the myriad questions (some stupid, some not-so-stupid) that

arise during the learning process. Gary has never failed me in this regard. His

uncanny intuition about plasma waves and stability theory has shaped the way

I think about the whole ﬁeld. He always found time to discuss things with me,

and was always genuinely concerned about my welfare. Wherever our paths may

take us, I know that he will always be my friend.

Next, all the folks at Livermore. . .

I would like to thank my supervisors at the Lawrence Livermore National

Laboratory, Gus Carlson from 1978 to 1982 and L. Donald Pearlstein from 1982

to the present, for generously allowing me the time I needed to complete this

thesis.

viii

The entire Mirror Theory and Computations group at Livermore has been a

great source of help, but the following names stand out in particular:

Steven Auerbach for innumerable discussions about everything under the sun

(plus some things inside the sun) including lots of stuﬀ in this thesis. It is a

pleasure to have a friend who appreciates the love of learning and the joy of

ﬁguring things out as much as Steve does.

Bruce Cohen for his concern and guidance during several critical stages of

this thesis, and especially for his many excellent suggestions for the application

of this work.

Brendan McNamara for teaching me much about the application of Lie trans-

forms to mode-coupling analyses in weak turbulence theory in general, and in

the B´enard convection problem in particular.

Dana Richards and Jan Wikkerink for their continued violations of the second

law of thermodynamics, without which everything would have fallen into utter

disorganization and chaos.

Next, all the folks in Berkeley. . .

Robert Littlejohn for millions of wonderful discussions on guiding-center the-

ory and diﬀerential geometry. Robert’s inﬂuence permeates this thesis from be-

gining to end. In many ways, this thesis is the relativistic generalization of the

revolution in plasma physics that was initiated by him.

Jerrold Marsden for numerous enlightening discussions about reduction,

gauge groups, nonlinear stability theory, etc. His course on the theory and

applications of symplectic and Poisson reduction has molded the way I think

about those topics.

Richard Montgomery for lots of helpful discussions about symplectic geom-

etry, the method of averaging, reduction, and the energy-Casimir method.

ix

Stephen Omohundro for teaching me the importance of geometrical intuition.

Many was the blackboard discussion at which Steve would label something “ob-

vious” that became clear to me only after much calculation.

It did not take

many such discussions to convince me of the importance of diﬀerential geomet-

rical intuition. With Steve’s help, I devoured books on the subject, and my

entire outlook in mathematical physics has not been the same since. The preva-

lence of such geometrical techniques in this thesis attests to their inﬂuence on

my thinking.

Philippe Similon for guidance and helpful suggestions on just about every-

thing in this thesis, especially the Poisson brackets and conservation laws for the

guiding-center plasma. Philippe has the rare combination of abilities required

to understand and use formalism, while never losing sight of the fact that its

purpose is to solve real problems in the real world.

Jonathan Wurtele for many discussions about nonlinear dynamics and dif-

ferential geometric techniques in physics.

Huanchun Ye for many helpful discussions, especially on the problem of res-

onances. This problem was largely ignored in my thesis, but Huanchun’s thesis

should ﬁll in the gap and make the theory more complete. His observations on

the relationship between torsion and spin seem to underlie the theory leading to

the conservation law for angular momentum in the guiding-center plasma. Once

again, it is quite possible that there is much left to be discovered in this area,

and it may be in Huanchun’s thesis.

Next, the folks at the University of California at Davis Department of Applied

Science. . .

Goldberg, Myron (Mike) A. Hoﬀman, John Killeen and Frederick Wooten.

advice, discussions and vanpool conversation on everything from Bell’s theorem

to quantum ﬁeld theory.

John Killeen for teaching me much advanced mathematics, and for several

enlightening discussions on computational plasma physics.

Fred Wooten for much guidance and advice about how to survive a PhD

William Hoover for teaching me statistical mechanics and for several good

which appeared in this thesis and some of which did not. As the only other

“plasma type” in my class at D.A.S. with an interest in nonlinear dynamics,

Robert and I consulted with each other a great deal.

Donna Cliﬀord for making sure I didn’t run afoul of the bureaucracy. I’m

not even sure I’d be a registered student now were it not for her (not to mention

the innumerable late fees that only her reminders saved me from having to pay).

Introduction

There was a time when a thorough working knowledge of geometry was consid-

ered an indispensible ingredient in the education of a natural philosopher. From

Euclid’s ﬁrst systematization of the subject more than two thousand years ago to

well after the end of the Renaissance, the study of the Elements was considered

a critically important part of mathematical instruction. Indeed, when reading

Newton’s Principia or Opticks, one is struck by the prevalence of geometrical

arguments and descriptions.

Alas, the introduction of coordinate systems by Descartes and the concommi-

tant analyticization of geometry changed all this. Using coordinates, geometrical

problems could be reduced to algebraic problems. The perceived need for good

geometrical intuition gradually disappeared. By the time Whittaker’s Treatise

on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies was ﬁrst published in

1904, this attitude had taken hold to the extent that Whittaker apparently felt

no need to include illustrations in his nearly ﬁve-hundred-page-long (and other-

wise excellent) document. At present, one can obtain an undergraduate degree

1

2

Introduction

in physics or even applied mathematics with little more geometry background

than is found in a secondary school textbook.

That this trend is disastrous has been appreciated only for the past couple

of decades. This appreciation has been due, in large part, to modern develop-

ments in the general theory of relativity. The entire lesson of relativity theory

is that physical laws ought not to depend upon the coordinate system chosen to

describe them; that is, the meaning of physical laws transcends their coordinate

description. Conversely, coordinate descriptions can have a way of masking fun-

damental physical reality. Thus, a coordinate-free description of physical laws

can have the beneﬁcial eﬀect of allowing one more easily to glimpse the under-

lying fundamental physical reality. Such coordinate-free mathematical language

is available, thanks in large part to the works of Cartan and Lie. Modern diﬀer-

ential geometry, including the exterior calculus and the theory of Lie groups, is

capable of providing a coordinate-free description of physical law. Please note

that what is being argued here is that such a coordinate-free description is far

more than just an alternative mathematical notation; the contention is that it

yields an improved understanding of the physics involved. A physicist who takes

the time to learn how, say, electromagnetic theory can be described in terms

of diﬀerential forms will have, as a result, an improved understanding of the

electromagnetic ﬁeld.

There is an additional beneﬁt to the geometrical point of view. Just as

Descartes found that algebra can be used as a tool for obtaining geometrical

results, likewise geometry can be used as a tool for obtaining analytical results

that would be far more diﬃcult to obtain any other way. Several examples of

this phenomenon will be pointed out in the course of this thesis.

Since the 1960’s it has been known that classical mechanics is describable

in terms of symplectic geometry. This observation paved the way for powerful

generalizations of some of the traditional methodologies of mechanics. For ex-

Introduction

ample, whereas Hamiltonian mechanics had been originally formulated in terms

of canonically conjugate pairs of coordinates, it was found that noncanonical

coordinates could be used instead, oftentimes to great advantage. Powerful new

types of perturbation theory, based on Lie transforms, were introduced; this

made higher-order perturbative treatments less laborious and more systematic.

Nowhere was the impact of this revolution more profound and beneﬁcial than

in the ﬁeld of plasma physics. Because the motion of charged particles in com-

plicated electromagnetic geometries and in wave ﬁelds requires a perturbative

treatment, it is not surprising that Lie transform perturbation theory was shown

to be a natural tool for systematizing, simplifying and better understanding many

of the calculations of plasma physics. Furthermore, it was shown that the most

natural treatment of the guiding-center problem (i.e. the ubiquitous problem of

computing the drifts of a charged particle gyrating in a slowly-varying electro-

magnetic ﬁeld) involved the use of noncanonical coordinates and noncanonical

coordinate transformations. All of this will become more clear as we proceed.

During the late nineteen seventies, Dewar [1] introduced the idea of canonical

oscillation-center transformations. Johnston and Kaufman [2] and Johnston [3]

used canonical perturbation theory to perform oscillation-center and mode cou-

pling analyses for the Vlasov plasma. In Cary’s PhD thesis [4], Lie transforms

were shown to be a useful tool for ponderomotive theory, and the K-χ theo-

rem [5] relating the ponderomotive Hamiltonian with the linear susceptibility

was formulated.

The extension of these techniques to magnetized plasma was made possi-

ble, or at least greatly facilitated, by Littlejohn’s work on the guiding-center

problem in his PhD thesis [6]. Littlejohn made the key observation that the

transformation from single-particle to guiding-center coordinates was best done

using noncanonical methods. This noncanonical transformation was done in his

thesis by using the Darboux theorem constructively, and it was followed by a

4

Introduction

canonical Lie transformation that averaged over the rapid gyromotion. Subse-

quently, Littlejohn [7] discovered that the entire transformation could be done

by a single Lie transform with a vector generator. This is the approach followed

in this thesis.

Ponderomotive theory for a magnetized relativistic plasma was then done by

Grebogi and Littlejohn [8], who used canonical Lie transforms. They pointed

out that the oscillation-center transformation for a magnetized plasma might

best be handled by noncanonical Lie methods, but they did not do it this way.

Their result was subsequently simpliﬁed by Cary and Newberger [9].

Meanwhile, Dubin, Krommes, Oberman and Lee [10] showed how to use Lit-

tlejohn’s methods to derive self-consistent gyrokinetic equations for an electro-

static plasma, including the Poisson equation whose source term was written in

terms of the guiding-center distribution function. Kaufman and Boghosian [11]

showed that this calculation could be done by summing the guiding-center ac-

tion over the entire distribution and coupling it to the Maxwell action; variation

with respect to the coordinate ﬁelds (considered to be functions of their initial

conditions) then yields the gyrokinetic equation, and variation with respect to

the vector potential then yields the self-consistent ﬁeld equaton. Finally, Sim-

ilon [12] showed that conservation laws for the guiding-center plasma could be

obtained by application of Noether’s theorem to this system action.

The above-mentioned work by Grebogi and Littlejohn was done for a rela-

tivistic plasma, but was not manifestly covariant in that it was done in “1 + 3”

notation. A manifestly covariant treatment is made possible with the help of

certain projection operators which were introduced by Fradkin [13] who obtained

the drifts for a relativistic guiding center (but did not use Lie methods), and by

Dumais [14].

The general plan of this thesis is as follows:

Chapter 2 will cover the mathematical preliminaries necessary to understand

Introduction

5

the diﬀerential geometric arguments used in this thesis. It should be emphasized

that this constitutes no more than a sketchy introduction, and is no substitute

for a good text on the subject; nevertheless it is probably suﬃcient to enable

a persistent person with an undergraduate background in physics to read and

understand this entire text. Chapter 2 also describes the application of these

techniques to Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics; speciﬁcally, Lie transform

perturbation theory is introduced here and many simple examples of its use are

presented.

Chapter 3 will treat the guiding-center problem for a relativistic charged

particle. We shall begin by examining the geometry of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

in four-dimensional spacetime, and we shall ﬁnd that there is a covariant way

to isolate the rapidly-gyrating component of the particle’s four velocity. Lie

transform perturbation theory is then applied to the particle’s phase-space La-

grangian in order to remove this rapidly-gyrating component and thus obtain

the residual parallel and drift motion. The perturbative calculation is carried

out to one order higher than the usual drifts, the natural guiding-center Poisson

bracket structure and Hamiltonian are presented, and the correction to the gyro-

momentum is given. Finally, it is shown how to cast these results in a manifestly

gyrogauge invariant format.

In Chapter 4 we shall study the eﬀects of eikonal wave perturbations on a

guiding center, once again using Lie transform perturbation theory. The result

is a complete ponderomotive description of the relativistic guiding center in an

eikonal wave ﬁeld, and we show how to cast this in manifestly gauge-invariant

form. To achieve manifest gauge-invariance, we shall ﬁnd it necessary to abandon

the usual approach of expanding the eikonal wave perturbation in a series of

Bessel functions of k⊥ρ. Instead, we shall ﬁrst perform a Lagrangian gauge

transformation, and then we shall expand in a series of special functions that

are related to indeﬁnite integrals of Bessel functions. The required Lagrangian

6

Introduction

gauge transformation is not obvious, and it would never have been discovered

without the use of diﬀerential geometric techniques. Finally, the ponderomotive

Hamiltonian is derived using Lie transforms.

In Chapter 5 we shall sum the resulting guiding-center Lagrangian over the

entire distribution of particles present in a plasma, and couple with the Maxwell

ﬁeld to obtain the total Lagrangian for a Vlasov plasma of relativistic guid-

ing centers. By varying this it is possible to derive a self-consistent gyroki-

netic description of such a plasma, including the magnetic moment tensor, in

manifestly-covariant format. Application of Noether’s theorem then yields con-

servation laws for the guiding-center plasma, and these are also cast in manifestly

covariant form. Finally, using the results of Chapter 4, the conservation laws

are derived for a guiding-center plasma in the presence of a wave ﬁeld.

In Chapter 6 we discuss some of the unanswered questions raised by this

study. These could be topics for future research.

Appendix A is a glossary of the mathematical symbols and notation used in

this thesis.

Appendix B is a review of some of the more primitive mathematical concepts

used in this thesis, such as vector spaces, dual spaces, algebras, and modules.

Appendix C applies vector Lie transforms to the nonrelativistic guiding-

center problem in two dimensions, and derives the shift in gyrofrequency due

to spatial gradients in the magnetic and (perpendicular) electric ﬁelds. This is

useful both as a demonstration of the vector Lie transform technique, and as a

comparison to the techniques and results of Chapter 3.

Appendix D derives and discusses the properties of a pair of special functions

that were introduced in Chapter 4.

Appendix E is a short tutorial on how to derive Bessel function sum rules,

including (but not limited to) those that were useful in Chapter 4.

Mathematical Preliminaries

2.1 Discussion

This chapter divides naturally into three sections. The ﬁrst covers the basic

results of diﬀerential geometry that are necessary to understand the rest of this

thesis. This includes the calculus of tensors and the exterior algebra. To reit-

erate, the exposition here is not intended to replace a good introductory book

on the subject (see, for example, the excellent introductory texts by Schutz [15],

Edelen [16], Singer and Thorpe [17], or Burke [18]), but it does present enough

material to make the thesis self-contained, and to establish notational conven-

tions. The theory of Lie groups has been omitted from this section because it

is not absolutely essential to the understanding of what follows, but the reader

with background in this area will be at a deﬁnite advantage.

Next, these tools are used to reformulate Hamiltonian and Lagrangian me-

chanics. The generalization to noncanonical coordinates is discussed, including

those with singular Poisson structures. Noether’s theorem is formulated, and

numerous worked examples are given. Mechanical systems with constraints are

examined from this new point of view.

Mathematical Preliminaries

Finally, Lie transform perturbation theory is presented, and its use for non-

canonical coordinates is discussed. Because we shall use Lie transforms in a more

general context than that in which they are usually presented, I recommend that

this section be read even by those already familiar with the subject.

2.2 Diﬀerential Geometric Concepts

2.2.1 Manifolds, Vectors, and Covectors

In this subsection, we shall discuss the ideas that are necessary to reformulate

tensor calculus in a fashion that more directly illustrates the geometrical founda-

tions of the subject. Appendix B goes one level deeper, and gives set-theoretical

deﬁnitions for many of the primitive terms that we shall use here (such as vector

space and algebra).

A manifold is a space that is locally Euclidean and in which there is a notion

of diﬀerentiation. This can be made more precise as follows: There must be a

diﬀerentiable one-to-one map, or diﬀeomorphism, from the neighborhood of any

point of a manifold to the points of

n, for some n. Such a map is called a chart,

ℜ

and the collection of all such maps for a given manifold is called an atlas. There

is an additional requirement that two maps in the same atlas that overlap must

do so smoothly; this means, among other things, that all charts in the same

atlas must map to

n with the same n. The number n is thus characteristic of

ℜ

the entire manifold, and is called the dimension of the manifold.

A chart is realized by (local) coordinates on the manifold. Since an n-

dimensional manifold, M, must map smoothly onto

n, it must be possible

to label the points of M, at least locally, by n numbers, say z1, . . . , zn. Then

ℜ

the map is given by expressing these numbers as functions of the coordinates,

x1, . . . , xn, on

n. Speciﬁcally, we write zα(x1, . . . , xn), for α = 1, . . . , n.

ℜ

It is generally not possible to cover an entire manifold with one chart. For

where θ and φ are the usual spherical coordinates (colatitude and azimuthal

2. The chart

ℜ

then maps the region π/4 < θ

π onto the open unit disk in

2. These two

ℜ

charts are thus suﬃcient to cover all of S2, and therefore constitute an atlas.

Any atlas for S2 must contain at least two charts. In general, the number of

charts needed to cover a manifold depends on its global topological properties.

A mapping from an m-dimensional manifold onto an n-dimensional manifold

is called an injection if m < n, a projection if m > n, and a bijection if m = n.

Consider a map from

to an n-dimensional manifold, M. That is,

M. Note

ℜ

that this is an injection if n > 1, and a bijection if n = 1. This map deﬁnes a

path through the manifold, M. The points in M that are on the path are those

in the range of the map. The realization of this mapping is given by expressing

each of the coordinates on M as functions of the coordinate, x, on

. That is,

we write zα(x) for α = 1, . . . , n. As x varies along

, the coordinates zα trace

ℜ

out the path in M. Note that although we keep writing down the coordinate

realizations of these things, the notion of a map from one manifold to another

has an intrinsic geometrical meaning as an association of members of one set of

points with members of another set of points, consistent with local topological

ℜ 7→

ℜ

properties of nearness, etc.

(2.5)

Mathematical Preliminaries

Now let P be a point on the above-mentioned path through the manifold,

M. Denote its coordinates by z1

P . Since it lies along the path, there must
, such that zα
P = zα(x0) for α = 1, . . . , n.
Now consider the derivatives of the functions, zα(x), with respect to the path

the n numbers,

associated with the point, P.

It is clear that there are many diﬀerent curves passing through point P that

will yield the same set of n numbers. Indeed, any curve whose coordinates near

P are given by

zα = zα

P + V αδx +

(δx2)

O

where δx

x

x0, will do so. The identiﬁcation of these n numbers thus gives

us a way to partition the set of all curves passing through point P into (an

inﬁnity of) equivalence classes; two curves are said to be equivalent if they yield

the same set of n numbers. That is, two curves are equivalent if they both have

the form given in the above equation (with the same V α’s).

Consider the set of equivalence classes of curves thus obtained. We can

deﬁne addition and scalar multiplication among the elements of this set in the

following very natural way: The equivalence class of curves with the n numbers

V α adds to the equivalence class of curves with the n numbers U α to yield

the equivalence class of curves with the n numbers V α + U α. The scalar a

multiplies the equivalence class of curves with the n numbers V α to yield the

equivalence class of curves with the n numbers aV α. With these operations, we

have converted the space of all equivalence classes of curves through the point P

into a vector space. This vector space will be called the tangent space at point

P of the manifold. Its elements have been introduced as equivalence classes of

Mathematical Preliminaries

11

curves, but it will become clear momentarily that these may be identiﬁed with

the usual notion of vectors as arrows with a certain magnitude and direction

and with certain transformation properties. Note, however, that the base of the

arrow is not free to move around, but rather is “pinned down” at the point P.

There is a diﬀerent tangent space at each point of a manifold, and vectors in one

tangent space may not be added to vectors in another diﬀerent tangent space.

Note that the dimension of a tangent space is equal to the dimension of the

manifold (in the above case, the dimension is n).

It is evident that the above-described n numbers V α associated with an

equivalence class of curves depend on our choice of coordinates for M. If our
coordinates on M had been z′α, then the n numbers would have been

V ′α =

(x0) =

dz′α
dx

∂z′α
∂zβ

dzβ
dx

(x0) =

∂z′α
∂zβ V β,

(2.7)

where we have adopted the convention of summation over repeated indices.

Readers familiar with traditional presentations of tensor calculus will recognize

this as the transformation law for components of contravariant vectors.

Recall that even though the components of a vector may vary from one

coordinate system to another, the vector itself, as an abstract mathematical

object, is an invariant geometrical concept. That is, given two sets of basis

vectors, ˆeα and ˆe′
α, we can write the components of a vector V as V α in the ﬁrst
system and as V ′α in the second. Though these will, in general, be diﬀerent, the
abstract vector V = V αˆeα = V ′αˆe′

α retains its form under the change of basis.

So how can we introduce bases in our tangent spaces that will reﬂect this

idea? Despite the fact that the above-described n numbers are coordinate-

dependent, if we form a ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential operator by using them as

coeﬃcients

ˆV

≡

V α ∂

∂zα = V ′α ∂
∂z′α ,

(2.8)

we see that this operator retains its form under a coordinate transformation.

12

Mathematical Preliminaries

This much is clear from the above equation. By analogy with the argument in
the preceeding paragraph, we can thus identify the operator ˆV with the vector

V, and the n operators ∂/∂zα with basis vectors that span the tangent space.

Thus the idea of vectors as arrows, as equivalence classes of curves, and as ﬁrst

order linear diﬀerential operators are all valid descriptions of the same concept!

A word is in order concerning the basis vectors that we have used above.

Note that they were induced by the coordinate system that we used. The choice

of a coordinate system zα on the manifold M gives rise to a natural basis ∂/∂zα

in each tangent space at each point of the manifold (or, more precisely, at each

point of M where the chart zα is operative). A change in coordinate system thus

gives rise to a change of basis; this is in accordance with the usual transformation

properties of contravariant vectors. A basis that is thus induced by a coordinate

system is called a coordinate basis. In the “arrow” picture, the basis vectors lie

along the local coordinate axes. In the “equivalence class of curves” picture, they

are curves that are locally coincident with the coordinate axes. In the “operator”

picture, they are directional derivatives along the coordinate directions.

One might well ask if all possible bases are coordinate bases. The answer is

“no.” If we start from a coordinate basis and make a change of basis by taking

various linearly independent combinations of basis vectors in each tangent space,

where the combinations may vary from point to point in the manifold, we may

arrive at a new basis that is not the coordinate basis for any coordinate system

on M. Thus, starting from the coordinate basis, ∂/∂zα, we may deﬁne the new

basis

ˆeβ = Λ α
β

∂
∂zα ,

where (Λ α

β ) is any nonsingular matrix. This new basis is perfectly good for

resolving vectors into coordinates. For example, the vector V may be written

(2.9)

(2.10)

V = V α ∂

∂zα = (V αΛβ

α)ˆeβ

Mathematical Preliminaries

13

α) is the inverse of the matrix (Λ α

γ ). So the components

where the matrix (Λβ
of V in the new basis are V αΛβ

α. The only diﬀerent thing about this new basis
is that there may not be any system of coordinates Zα such that ˆeα = ∂/∂Zα.

In this case, such a basis is called a noncoordinate basis. This idea will become

more clear and examples will be given in Subsection 2.2.5.

Meanwhile, since we have now attached vector spaces to every point of a

manifold, we can go on to construct their dual spaces. The dual space to the

tangent space of vectors at point P is called the cotangent space at point P. Its

elements are called covectors or covariant vectors or one forms. Once again, the

cotangent space has the same dimension as the manifold.

Once we have a set of basis vectors in the tangent space, say ˆeα, there is

induced a preferred set of basis covectors in the cotangent space, call them

h

= δα

˜ωα, ˆeβi

˜ωα, such that

β . Thus we can represent a covector at point P by n
numbers, say aα, where, as usual, α can range from 1 to n. The abstract covector
is then a = aα ˜ωα. The covector a pairs with the vector V to yield

a, V

˜ωα, ˆeβi

β = aαV α.

(2.11)

Note that even though there is a naturally induced covector basis corre-

sponding to a given vector basis, there is no natural correspondence between

individual vectors and individual covectors. That is, there is no natural map

from the tangent space to the cotangent space. Later on, we shall see that if we

endow our manifold with a metric, such a map is established. The addition of

a metric thus gives the manifold much more structure than it would otherwise

have. At this point in our discussion, we are not assuming the existence of a

metric on our manifold. As we shall see, even without a metric, a manifold has

lots of interesting structure to study. The general philosophy of this discussion is

to start simply and slowly add structure; thus a discussion of metrics is deferred

to the end of this section.

Mathematical Preliminaries

To make our discussion of covectors more concrete, let us suppose that we

have a coordinate system zα on our manifold, M. This induces the coordinate

basis vectors ∂/∂zα on each tangent space of M. If we transform coordinates

to another system Zα, the components of the vector V transform according to

Eq. (2.7). Now say the covector a has components aα in the ﬁrst coordinate

system. The components of the covector must transform in such a way as to

leave the scalar

a, V

invariant. Thus

so

(2.12)

(2.13)

a′

α =

∂zβ
∂z′α aβ.

Once again, readers familiar with traditional presentations of tensor calculus will

recognize this as the transformation law for components of covariant vectors.

Now, how can we introduce bases in our cotangent spaces that will reﬂect the

above ideas? Despite the fact that the n numbers aα are coordinate-dependent,

if we form the diﬀerential that has them as coeﬃcients

aαdzα = a′

αdz′α,

˜a

≡

(2.14)

we see that this retains its form under a coordinate transformation. This much

is clear from the above equation. We can thus identify the diﬀerential form ˜a

with the covector a, and the n diﬀerentials dzα with basis covectors that span

the cotangent space.

Thus, just as contravariant vectors could be identiﬁed with ﬁrst order linear

diﬀerential operators, we see that covectors can be identiﬁed with diﬀerential

forms. These descriptions are dual to each other, so

dzα,

h

∂
∂zβ i

= δα
β .

(2.15)

Finally we note that the same distinction between coordinate and noncoor-

dinate bases that applied to our discussion of tangent space bases also applies

Mathematical Preliminaries

15

to cotangent space bases. Up until now, we have restricted our attention to

coordinate cotangent bases, but we could deﬁne new basis one forms by taking

linear combinations of the dzα where the combinations may vary from point to

point in the manifold. In this way, we may arrive at a new basis that is not the

coordinate cotangent basis for any coordinate system on M. Thus, starting from

the coordinate cotangent space basis, dzα, we may deﬁne the new cotangent

space basis

˜ωβ = Λβ

αdzα

where (Λβ

α) is any nonsingular matrix. This new basis is perfectly good for
resolving covectors into coordinates. For example, the covector a may be written

(2.16)

(2.17)

a = aαdzα = (aαΛ α

β )˜ωβ

γ ) is the inverse of the matrix (Λβ

where the matrix (Λ α
α). So the components
of a in the new basis are aαΛ α
β . The only diﬀerent thing about this new basis
is that there may not be any system of coordinates Zα such that ˜ωα = dZ α.

Once again, this idea will become more clear and examples will be given in

Subsection 2.2.5.

2.2.2 General Tensors and the Tensor Product

Now that we have a tangent space and a cotangent space associated with each

and every point of our manifold, we can create still bigger spaces at each point

by taking the Cartesian product of some number of tangent spaces and some

number of cotangent spaces. Suppose we deﬁne the space Πs

r to be the Carte-

sian product of s copies of the tangent space and r copies of the cotangent

space at point P of a manifold M. Consider a multilinear map Πs

. That

r 7→ ℜ

is, we are considering a map that takes s vectors and r covectors at point P

and returns a real number.

If the s vectors are denoted V1, . . . , Vs, and the

r covectors are denoted a1, . . . , ar, then the real number will be denoted by

16

Mathematical Preliminaries

T(a1, . . . , ar, V1, . . . , Vs). By a “multilinear” map, we mean that T is linear in

all of its arguments. Such a map is said to be a tensor of type (r, s). Note that a

vector is a tensor of type (1, 0), and a covector is a tensor of type (0, 1); this is

because a vector can take a covector and return a real number (by the pairing),

and vice versa.

There is an obvious way to deﬁne addition among tensors: Given two tensors,

T1 and T2, we can deﬁne a new tensor, T3, by the prescription

T3(a1, . . . , ar, V1, . . . , Vs)

= T1(a1, . . . , ar, V1, . . . , Vs) + T2(a1, . . . , ar, V1, . . . , Vs),

(2.18)

for all possible arguments. In this case, we write T3 = T1 + T2. This operation

of addition makes the space of all tensors of type (r, s) a vector space.

Suppose we have two vectors, U1 and U2, and a covector, b1, at some point
of a manifold. Suppose we are given anew a pair of covectors, a1 and a2, and a

vector, V1 (at the same point of the manifold). Consider the following recipe for

obtaining a real number: Pair the two covectors with U1 and U2, respectively,

and pair the vector with b1. This gives us three real numbers. Multiply them

together to get a single real number. In this way, the presence of U1, U2, and b1
provides us with a map from Π1

. It is easily seen that this map is multilinear.

2 to

ℜ

Thus, the presence of U1, U2, and b1 provides us with the following tensor of

type (2, 1):

This is denoted

T(a1, a2, V1) =

a1, U1ih
A tensor formed in this way is said to be the tensor product of U1, U2, and b1.

a2, U2ih

T = U1 ⊗

(2.20)

More generally, given r vectors, U1, . . . , Ur, and s covectors, b1, . . . , bs, we

can form a tensor of type (r, s) by taking the tensor product

T = U1 ⊗

(2.21)

If we feed this tensor the r covectors, a1, . . . , ar, and the s vectors, V1, . . . , Vs,

then we get the scalar

(2.22)

The space of all possible tensors (of any type) at some point in an n-

dimensional manifold may be thought of as an inﬁnite dimensional vector space,

although it is somewhat strange in that two of its elements can be added if and

only if they are tensors of the same type. In any event, the tensor product makes

this space an algebra.

It is straightforward to see that the vector space of all tensors of type (r, s)

is nr+s-dimensional. That is, a tensor of type (r, s) has nr+s independent com-

ponents. A moment’s thought convinces one that a basis for this space is given

by the nr+s basis tensors

ˆeα1 ⊗

. . .

ˆeαr ⊗

˜ωβ1

⊗

˜ωβs,

(2.23)

where the ˆe’s and ˜ω’s are the basis vectors and basis covectors in the tangent

and cotangent spaces, respectively, and where the α and β indices all range from

1 to n. Thus, a general tensor may be written

T = T α1...αr
β1...βs

ˆeα1 ⊗

. . .

ˆeαr ⊗

⊗

˜ωβ1

. . .

⊗

⊗

˜ωβs.

(2.24)

Finally, we consider the transformation properties of the components of these

general tensors. We know how vector and covector components transform, and

we know that a tensor of type (r, s) takes r covectors and s vectors and returns a

scalar invariant. Thus, by an argument identical to that which led to Eq. (2.13),

we ﬁnd that for a transformation from one coordinate basis to another coordinate

as well, so that for a transformation between general bases the above equation

Notice that the αth component of the vector can be recovered by applying the

operator to zα:

ˆV

≡

V α = ˆVzα.

(2.27)

(2.28)

As has been mentioned, it is possible to actually identify the vector with its

corresponding operator. Many mathematics texts actually do this, and it is per-

fectly permissible since there is an obvious one to one correspondence between

vectors and ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential operators by the above equations. In-

deed, there are numerous advantages to such identiﬁcation, but we shall continue

to use the circumﬂex to distinguish the operator in order to avoid any ambiguity.

It is important to note that the operators corresponding to two diﬀerent vec-

tor ﬁelds do not, in general, commute. Indeed, the commutator of two ﬁrst-order

linear diﬀerential operators is another ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential operator. At

ﬁrst this may seem surprising because it is not obvious that this commutator is

a ﬁrst order operator. By writing it in terms of the components of V and U,

19

however, we see that the second order terms do indeed cancel:

The vector whose operator is the commutator of the operators of two other

vectors, V and U, is said to be the Lie bracket of those two vectors, and is

denoted by [V, U]. Note that the Lie bracket operation makes the space of all

vector ﬁelds into a Lie algebra.

Using the Lie bracket, it is possible to give a simple test that will determine

whether or not any given set of basis vectors is a coordinate basis: A set of

n linearly independent vectors constitutes a coordinate basis if and only if the

Lie bracket of any two elements of the set vanishes. The “only if” part of this

theorem is obvious, since coordinate basis vectors are partial derivatives and

these always commute with each other. The converse, however, is a special case

of something called Frobenius’ theorem, and is somewhat harder to see. To

prove it algebraically, we must show that it is possible to actually construct a

coordinate system (at least locally) given the n linearly independent commuting

vectors. We shall not follow this approach here (see Schutz [15] for details on

how to prove it this way). Instead, we shall follow a more geometrical line of

reasoning that will make the theorem almost obvious. To do this, however, we

ﬁrst need to learn about the Lie derivative.

2.2.4 Lie Derivatives

a new scalar ﬁeld denoted by

The Lie derivative of a scalar ﬁeld, f (z), with respect to the vector ﬁeld, V, is
LV f, and is given by:
LV f = ˆVf = V α ∂f
∂zα .

(2.30)

20

so

This is recognized as the directional derivative of f along the vector ﬁeld, V.

Along any given ﬁeld line of V, it is possible to deﬁne a coordinate, λ, such that:

Mathematical Preliminaries

V α =

dzα
dλ

ˆV =

d
dλ

,

(2.31)

(2.32)

and so the Lie derivative of f with respect to V is simply df /dλ. That is, we

evaluate the scalar ﬁeld at the points z(λ0) and z(λ0 + δλ) along the ﬁeld line,

subtract the ﬁrst value from the second, divide the result by δλ, and let δλ go

to zero to get the Lie derivative. In Fig. 2.1, these two points of evaluation are

denoted by A and B.

A scalar ﬁeld, f, whose Lie derivative with respect to V vanishes is said to

be a Lie dragged scalar ﬁeld with respect to the vector ﬁeld V. Intuitively, this

means that the scalar ﬁeld is constant along the ﬁeld lines of V. Alternatively

stated, it means that the scalar ﬁeld satisﬁes the ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential
equation ˆVf = 0, whose characteristics are the ﬁeld lines of V. Thus, if the value

of a Lie dragged scalar ﬁeld is speciﬁed at any one point of a ﬁeld line of V, its

value everywhere else on that same ﬁeld line is determined (it’s the same value).

Using this concept, we can reword our deﬁnition of a Lie derivative: Begin by

evaluating the scalar ﬁeld f at point A. Next, drag the scalar f at point B back

to point A to get the scalar f ∗ at A (note f ∗(A) = f (B)). Now at the point A
LV f.
This may sound like a fancy way of saying the same thing, but it will aid in our

we subtract f from f ∗, divide the result by δλ, and let δλ go to zero to get

eﬀorts to generalize the Lie derivative to act on other things besides scalars.

Consider the problem of trying to deﬁne an analogous derivative that acts on

contravariant vectors. We could begin by evaluating a vector ﬁeld, say U, at the

same two points, z(λ0) and z(λ0 + δλ), along a ﬁeld line of V. Unfortunately,

however, we cannot subtract them because they live in two diﬀerent vector

Mathematical Preliminaries

21

Figure 2.1: Lie Diﬀerentiation of a Scalar Field

22

Mathematical Preliminaries

spaces: The ﬁrst lives in the space of all vectors at the point z(λ0), while the

second lives in the space of all vectors at z(λ0 + δλ). We are dealing with spaces

in which there may be no notion of parallel transport, so there is no natural way

of comparing vectors located at two diﬀerent points.

So we must be a little more clever. Refer to Fig. 2.2. Just as we have

coordinatized a given ﬁeld line of V by λ, we shall use µ to coordinatize a given
ﬁeld line of U. The operator ˆU is then d/dµ. It acts on scalars by evaluating them

at z(µ0) and z(µ0 + δµ), subtracting the ﬁrst value from the second, dividing

by δµ, and letting δµ go to zero. In Fig. 2.2, these two points of evaluation are

denoted by A and C; note that we have arranged things in this ﬁgure so that

point A is parametrized by both λ0 on the V ﬁeld line, and µ0 on the U ﬁeld

line.

Now we can imagine sliding the points A and C along the V ﬁeld lines for

an increment δλ, to arrive at the new points B and D, respectively. These new

points deﬁne a new ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential operator based at the point B.

It acts on scalars by evaluating them at the points B and D, subtracting the ﬁrst

value from the second, dividing by δµ (it is clear that points B and D coincide

as δµ

0), and letting δµ go to zero. This ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential operator

→

at B corresponds to a vector at point B, and so we see that we have found a

natural way to drag the vector ﬁeld U along the vector ﬁeld V. If a vector ﬁeld

U is unchanged by dragging it along V, then it is said to be a Lie dragged vector

ﬁeld with respect to V.

Armed with this insight, we are ready to deﬁne the Lie derivative of a vector

point A. Next, we drag the vector U at point B back to point A to get the

vector U∗ at A. Now we can subtract U from U∗, divide the result by δλ, and
LV U. It should be clear from this description that the
Lie derivative of a Lie dragged vector ﬁeld vanishes, just as was the case for

We have just demonstrated that the Lie derivative of U with respect to V is
(cid:12)

simply the Lie bracket of V and U:

LV U = [V, U] .

In a coordinate basis, this result may be written

(

LV U)α = V βU α

,β −

U βV α

,β.

Note that this way of writing the result may be taken as valid for a noncoordinate

basis as well if we reinterpret the commas as meaning “operation by the basis

vector.” That is, f,α denotes the result of applying to f the operator correspond-

ing to the basis vector ˆeα. For a coordinate basis, the operators corresponding

to basis vectors are simply partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates,

so this reduces to the usual meaning of the comma. This generalization of what

the comma means will be useful in everything that follows.

Now that we know how to take the Lie derivative of a contravariant vector

ﬁeld, we shall try to extend this process to covector ﬁelds. Recall that covectors

contract with contravariant vectors to give scalars. We deﬁne a Lie dragged cov-

ector ﬁeld to be one which when contracted with any Lie dragged contravariant

vector ﬁeld yields a Lie dragged scalar ﬁeld. To take the Lie derivative of a cov-

ector ﬁeld a with respect to V, we evaluate a at the points A and B in Fig. 2.1,

drag a(B) back to A to get a∗(A), subtract a(A) from a∗(A), divide by δλ, and

28

let δλ go to zero. The result is:

LV a)α = V βaα,β + V β
Once again, this result is valid for noncoordinate bases if we generalize the

,αaβ,

(2.42)

meaning of the commas.

Next we consider the Lie derivative of a general tensor. We ﬁrst deﬁne a Lie

dragged tensor of type (r, s) as one which yields a Lie dragged scalar ﬁeld when

fed r Lie dragged covectors and s Lie dragged vectors. To take the Lie derivative

of a tensor T of type (r, s) with respect to V, we evaluate T at the points A and

B in Fig. 2.1, drag T(B) back to A to get T∗(A), subtract T(A) from T∗(A),

divide by δλ, and let δλ go to zero. The result is:

Mathematical Preliminaries

Before leaving this subsection, it is important to emphasize that the same

geometrical notions that led us to the Lie derivative of a vector ﬁeld still apply for

arbitrary tensors: The Lie derivative is the natural way to “drag” any tensorial

object along the ﬁeld lines of a vector ﬁeld. Just as we dragged the vector U

along the ﬁeld line of the vector V for a parameter interval δλ to get the vector

(see Eq. (2.33)), so we can drag the tensor T in exactly the same way to get

U∗ = U + (

LV U)δλ

T∗ = T + (

LV T)δλ.

(2.46)

(2.47)

This geometrical insight is crucial to the understanding of Lie transforms.

2.2.5 Examples of Coordinate and Noncoordinate Bases

We are now in a position to understand the theorem presented at the end of

Section 2.2.3 from a geometrical point of view. Fig. 2.3 and Eq. (2.33) make

it clear that the Lie bracket of two vector ﬁelds is related to the inﬁnitesimal

diﬀerence in position resulting from the operation of moving along the ﬁrst

vector ﬁeld for a certain parameter interval, then along the second vector ﬁeld,

then backwards for the same parameter interval along the ﬁrst, then backwards

along the second. Clearly, if the vector ﬁelds involved are basis elements of a

coordinate basis, this operation will simply take one around a square right back

to the original position. The sides of the square are the contours of constant

values of the two coordinates involved. Conversely, if two members of a set of n

linearly independent vectors have nonvanishing Lie bracket, then it is impossible

to construct a coordinate system that has those vectors as a basis because moving

around the above-described inﬁnitesimal loop does not return one to the starting

point; the changing parameters do not “hook together” in the manner necessary

for them to be coordinates.

30

Mathematical Preliminaries

Part of the reason that this concept of coordinate and noncoordinate bases

is tricky is that there is no need for such a distinction in Cartesian coordinates.

There, the coordinate basis is identical to the usual orthonormal basis

A good example of a familiar situation for which the distinction is important is

that of polar coordinates in two dimensions. The usual polar unit vectors, ˆr and
ˆθ, are not a coordinate basis since

On the other hand, ∂/∂r and ∂/∂θ do constitute a valid coordinate basis, and

these are related to the above orthonormal basis by

(2.48)

(2.49)

(2.50)

The important point is that there are no pair of coordinates, ξ and η, such
that ˆr = ∂/∂ξ and ˆθ = ∂/∂η. Geometrically, this is because if we traverse an
inﬁnitesimal loop following ﬁrst the ˆr vector ﬁeld and then the ˆθ vector ﬁeld

(and then returning along them, respectively) we will not arrive at our starting

point (see Fig. 2.4). The factor of r on the right hand side of the second of

Eqs. (2.50) corrects for this and gives us a coordinate basis.

As mentioned previously, the above distinction also holds for covectors. To

pursue the above example, the covector basis consisting of dr and dθ is dual to

the vector basis consisting of ∂/∂r and ∂/∂θ. It follows that the covector basis

˜r = dr

and

and

Mathematical Preliminaries

31

32

˜θ = rdθ

(2.51)

is dual to the vector basis ˆr and ˆθ. Once again, there is no pair of coordinates,
ξ and η, such that ˜r = dξ and ˜θ = dη.

2.2.6 Diﬀerential Forms

An s-form is deﬁned as a tensor of type (0, s) that is antisymmetric in every pair

of its s vector arguments. In particular, a zero form is a scalar and a one form
is a covector; a two form, ˜Ω, obeys

˜Ω(U, V) =

˜Ω(V, U),

−

(2.52)

etc. It follows that the components of an s-form are antisymmetric under in-

terchange of any pair of indices.

In particular, this means that the s indices

must all be diﬀerent, or else the component will vanish. Hence the requirement

of antisymmetry means that there are no longer ns independent components.

Instead, a standard combinatorial argument shows that only

n
s 






≡

s!(n

s)!

n!

−

(2.53)

of the components are truly independent. This means, among other things, that

there are no nontrivial s-forms in an n-dimensional space if s > n, that an n-

form has only one nontrivial component, etc. The total number of independent

components of all forms in a space of dimension n is thus

n

s=0
X





n
s 


= (1 + 1)n = 2n.

(2.54)

Note that s-forms inherit some properties from the fact that they are tensors

of type (0, s). In particular, two s-forms may be added to get a third s-form.

Thus, the set of all forms at a point in an n-dimensional manifold may be thought

Mathematical Preliminaries

33

of as a 2n-dimensional vector space, although it is somewhat strange in that its

elements may be added if and only if they are both s-forms for some s. Note,

however, that this space is not an algebra under the tensor product operation

because it is not closed under that operation: The tensor product of two forms

is not necessarily a form. If we take the tensor product of an s1-form with an

s2-form, we get a tensor of type (0, s1 + s2) that is clearly antisymmetric under

interchange of any two of its ﬁrst s1 or last s2 arguments, but is not necessarily

antisymmetric under interchange of one of its ﬁrst s1 components with one of

its last s2 components.

Tensors

2.2.7 The Wedge Product, the Interior Product, Dual

It would thus be nice to deﬁne a product under which the set of all forms

becomes a closed algebra. Such a product is called the wedge product, and is

denoted by the symbol

. We motivate its deﬁnition as follows: The wedge

∧

product of a scalar (zero form) with any s-form is the s-form obtained by simple

multiplication by the scalar. The wedge product of two one forms, a1 and a2, is

the two form given by

a1

a2 = a1

∧

a2

⊗

−

a1.

(2.55)

It is clear that the two form thus obtained is antisymmetric. For three or more

one forms, we demand that the wedge product be associative, so, for example

Note that the factor of s! appears here because we did not put it into the

deﬁnition of the wedge product; we could have done it either way, and authors

diﬀer in this convention.

Now that we know how the wedge product operates on scalars and one forms,

we can extend its deﬁnition to arbitrary forms by writing them in terms of wedge

products of basis one forms, as shown above. This makes the 2n-dimensional

vector space of all forms into an algebra, called a Grassmann algebra. Note that

it is not a commutative algebra: If Ω1 and Ω2 are s1 and s2-forms, respectively,

then

Ω1 ∧
If we contract the ﬁrst index of an s-form (where s

V, then it is straightforward to see that we get an (s

Recall that we deﬁned an s-form as a completely antisymmetric tensor of type

(0, s). Note that we could have done the same thing for completely antisymmetric

tensors of type (s, 0). Next note that a completely antisymmetric tensor of type

(0, s) has exactly the same number of components as a completely antisymmetric

tensor of type (n

s, 0) in a space of dimension n

s. This is because

−


This suggests that there may be a one-to-one correspondence between s-forms



and completely antisymmetric tensors of type (n

s, 0).

For example, note that there is only one independent component of a com-

pletely antisymmetric tensor of type (n, 0). This is because the components of

such a tensor must be proportional to those of the Levi-Civita symbol, ǫβ1...βn .

The proportionality constant is a scalar (zero form). Similarly, we can put any

scalar (zero form) in front of the Levi-Civita symbol, and obtain the components

of a completely antisymmetric tensor of type (n, 0). Thus, there is a one-to-one

correspondence between scalars (zero forms) and completely antisymmetric ten-

More generally, we can use the Levi-Civita symbol to obtain a one-to-one

correspondence between s-forms and completely antisymmetric tensors of type

sors of type (n, 0).

Here we have used the easily veriﬁed relation

Referring to Eq. (2.64), we say that T is dual to Ω with respect to ǫ. This is often

abbreviated T = ∗Ω. Referring to Eq. (2.65), we say that Ω is dual to T with

respect to ǫ, or Ω = ∗T. Note that for any form, Ω, we have ∗∗Ω = (

1)s(n−s)Ω.

2.2.8 The Exterior Derivative and the Homotopy Formula

We now deﬁne a diﬀerential operator, d, that converts s-forms into (s+1)-forms.

This operator is deﬁned as follows: When applied to a scalar (zero form), f, it

yields the one form, df, such that

Thus, in a coordinate basis, zα, we have

df (V) = ˆVf.

df =

∂f
∂zα dzα.

Next, we demand that the operator be linear, so if Ω and Λ are two s-forms

then

d(Ω + Λ) = dΩ + dΛ.

(2.69)

Next, we demand that if Ω1 is an s1-form and Ω2 is an s2-form,

d(Ω1 ∧

Ω2) = dΩ1 ∧

Ω2 + (

1)s1 Ω1 ∧
−

dΩ2.

Finally, we demand that for any s-form, Ω, we have

ddΩ = 0.

The above demands deﬁne the operator d uniquely and unambiguously. We can

apply the exterior derivative to an arbitrary form by ﬁrst expanding it in terms

of wedge products of basis one forms, and then applying the above rules.

A form whose exterior derivative vanishes is said to be closed. A form that

is the exterior derivative of another form is said to be exact. Clearly, any exact

form is closed. The interesting question is whether or not any closed form is

exact. The answer to this depends on the global topology of the manifold on

which the closed form lives. Locally, it is always true.

There is a marvelous relationship between Lie derivatives, interior products,

and exterior derivatives. It is possible to prove that

LV Ω = iV dΩ + diV Ω

(2.75)

for any n-form, Ω, with n

1, and any vector ﬁeld, V. This relationship is called

≥

the homotopy formula. The proof usually given (see for example Section 4.20 of

Schutz [15]) proceeds by induction: It is ﬁrst proved for a one-form, and then it

is shown that it works for an n-form if it works for an (n

1)-form.

The generalized homotopy formula,

j

V Ω = (iV d)jΩ + (diV )jΩ

L

(2.76)

for j

1, is proved by induction as follows: First note that it reduces to the

≥

ordinary homotopy formula when j = 1. Next, assume that it is true for j = l.

V Ω = (iV d + diV )[(iV d)lΩ + (diV )lΩ]
= (iV d)l+1Ω + (diV )l+1Ω,

(2.77)

where we have used the fact that application of dd or iV iV causes any form to

vanish. Note that the generalized homotopy formula is not true for j = 0.

Finally, we can show that Lie derivatives commute with exterior derivatives.

This is done as follows:

d

LV = d(iV d + diV ) = diV d = (iV d + diV )d =

LV d,

(2.78)

where we have used the homotopy formula.

2.2.9

Integration on Manifolds

Diﬀerential s-forms can also be introduced as integrands of s-dimensional inte-

grals. See Flanders [19] for more on this approach. Adopting this point of view,

it is possible to prove the generalized Stokes’ theorem

where U is an (s + 1)-dimensional volume, and ∂U is the s-dimensional surface

dΩ =

that bounds it.

We shall not attempt to prove the generalized Stokes’ theorem here (see

Schutz [15] for a good presentation), but we shall make it plausible by show-

ing how it reduces to the familiar Stokes’ theorem and divergence theorem of

three dimensional vector calculus. In three dimensional Euclidean space, with

Cartesian coordinates, the gradient is given in our notation by

Thus we see that our formalism is the natural generalization of three dimensional

vector calculus to manifolds of arbitrary dimension.

2.2.10 Metric Spaces

The usual dot product of linear algebra is a rule for taking two vectors, say U and

V, and associating with them a real number, denoted U

V. The result depends

·

bilinearly on the two vectors involved, so we see that there is a tensor of type

(0, 2) at work here. Furthermore, the dot product is required to be commutative,

so the tensor must be symmetric. Denoting this tensor by g, we have

U

V = g(U, V).

·

This tensor is called the metric tensor. If we also demand that it have an inverse,

then we can ﬁnd a basis for which it has diagonal form with entries equal to

(if all the diagonal entries can be made equal to +1, then we say that the metric

Mathematical Preliminaries

is deﬁnite, otherwise we say that it is indeﬁnite). The trace of the metric in this

canonical diagonal form is called its signature.

A metric tensor ﬁeld is the association of such a type (0, 2) symmetric tensor

with every point of a manifold. It must have an inverse at every point. It follows

that the signature is the same at every point of the manifold.

A manifold endowed with a metric has all sorts of new structure. For the

purposes of our discussion, its most important role is to provide a one-to-one

correspondence between vectors and covectors. For, given any vector, say V, we

can form the covector, g(V,

). The components of this new covector are then

gαβV β. Denote the inverse of gαβ by gβγ, so

gαβgβγ = δγ
α.

(2.88)

Then, given any covector, say a, we can form the vector with components gαβaβ.

Note that this is a one to one correspondence.

Frequently we shall use the same symbol to denote a vector and its corre-

sponding covector in a metric space. That is, we may write

or

Vα = gαβV β,

V α = gαβVβ.

(2.89)

(2.90)

This process is called index raising or index lowering, as the case may be. It can

be used to raise or lower the indices of any tensor of any type.

We shall frequently abuse notation by using the dot product to denote the

interior product of a vector with a covector. That is, we may write

V = a(V) = aαV α.

a

·

(2.91)

When this is done, it will be obvious from context, so no confusion should arise.

We shall occasionally further abuse notation by using a “double dot” notation

Mathematical Preliminaries

41

for two contracted indices. That is, given two tensors of type (0, 2) and (2, 0),

respectively, we may write

F : G = FαβGαβ.

(2.92)

Once again, things should be clear from context.

A metric tensor ﬁeld does far more than provide an invertible map from

vectors to covectors. It also induces on the manifold something called an aﬃne

connection. This makes it possible to compare vectors in nearby tangent spaces.

Recall that Lie dragging gave us a way to do this, but there had to be a vector

ﬁeld present in the ﬁrst place along which to drag, and we could drag only in

the direction of that ﬁeld. An aﬃne connection allows us to parallel transport

vectors from one tangent space to any other one nearby; that is, it gives us a

notion of parallelism between vectors in diﬀerent tangent spaces. Furthermore,

it does not require the presence of any vector ﬁeld there to begin with. One

does not need a metric to have an aﬃne connection, but the presence of a metric

induces an aﬃne connection in a natural way.

Armed with an aﬃne connection, it is possible to go on to deﬁne such things

as curvature and torsion. While knowledge of this material is certainly helpful in

understanding the material presented in this thesis (especially the curvature and

polarization guiding-center drifts and the intimate relationship between torsion

and spin angular momentum), it is not essential. Thus we shall not go on to

discuss these topics; the interested reader is referred to Schutz [15] for a good

introduction, and to Misner, Thorne and Wheeler [20] or Chandrasekhar [21] for

a more detailed presentation.

2.3 Noncanonical Hamiltonian and

Lagrangian Mechanics

2.3.1 Canonical Versus Noncanonical Coordinates

In elementary classical mechanics courses, Hamiltonian mechanics is derived by

application of a Legendre transformation to the system Lagrangian. This pro-

cess gives rise to canonical coordinates in a very natural way. When it becomes

necessary to change coordinates on phase space, the student is taught to restrict

attention to the limited class of transformations that will maintain this separa-

tion of the coordinates into canonically conjugate pairs; these are the so-called

canonical transformations.

The Poisson bracket of two scalar phase functions, A and B, is then intro-

duced by deﬁning it in terms of partial derivatives with respect to the canonically

conjugate pairs of coordinates, qi and pi (the index i ranges over all the degrees

of freedom):

A, B

∂A
∂qi

where we have adopted the convention of summation over repeated indices. It

is then shown that this bracket is bilinear:

Mathematicians have a diﬀerent way of looking at all of this. In mathemat-

ics courses on Hamiltonian mechanics, one is more likely to deﬁne the Poisson

bracket as any rule for taking a pair of scalar phase functions and associating

with them a third scalar phase function consistent with the properties listed in

Eqs. (2.94) through (2.98) above. Now it is manifest that any Poisson bracket

given by the physicists’ deﬁnition is also a Poisson bracket according to the

mathematicians’ deﬁnition. The converse, however, is not true; that is, there

exist Poisson brackets that obey all of the above-listed properties, but are not

given by Eq. (2.93) for any set of canonical coordinates, q and p. Thus, by adopt-

ing the mathematicians’ deﬁnition, we can generalize what is meant by a Poisson

bracket in a very powerful way.

To see how this comes about, let us take the mathematicians’ viewpoint and

suppose that we have a phase space with coordinates, zα, where α ranges from

1 to N. For canonical coordinates, N is twice the number of degrees of freedom

and the zα are the q’s and p’s, but let us not restrict ourselves to this special

case in any way; in particular, N could be an odd number, and there need not

be any natural pairing amongst the coordinates.

Denote the Poisson bracket of coordinate zα with coordinate zβ by:

J αβ

zα, zβ

.

}

≡ {

(2.99)

Suppose that we changed our phase space coordinates, z

z′. Then, using

7→

the chain rule, Eq. (2.97), we see that the Poisson bracket of two of the new

coordinates is given by:

J ′αβ

z′α, z′β

≡ {

∂z′α
∂zξ {

zξ, zη

(2.100)

or

∂zξ
This makes it clear that the J αβ are the components of a second rank contravari-

∂z′β
∂zη J ξη.

J ′αβ =

(2.101)

ant tensor. This tensor will henceforth be called the Poisson tensor. Using the

chain rule once again, we see that the Poisson bracket of any two phase functions,

A and B, may be written in terms of the Poisson tensor as follows:

A, B

=

{

}

∂A

∂zα J αβ ∂B

∂zβ

(2.102)

The general form of the bracket given by Eq. (2.102) is clearly bilinear and

obeys the chain rule (or, equivalently, the Leibniz product rule). Now, the other

two deﬁning properties of the Poisson bracket may be expressed as properties

of the Poisson tensor. It is easily seen that antisymmetry of the bracket implies

and is implied by antisymmetry of the Poisson tensor:

J αβ =

J βα.

−

(2.103)

Somewhat more algebra shows that the Jacobi property of the bracket implies

and is implied by the following property of the Poisson tensor:

J αξJ βγ

,ξ + J γξJ αβ

,ξ + J βξJ γα

,ξ = 0,

(2.104)

where the commas denote partial diﬀerentiation. Thus, our philosophy shall

be that any tensor that has these two properties deﬁnes a perfectly legitimate

Poisson bracket according to Eq. (2.102).

Let us see how this works for canonical coordinates, qi and pi, where i ranges
from 1 to the number of degrees of freedom, I. Write zα = qα for α = 1, . . . , I,

and zα = pα−I for α = I + 1, . . . , N where N = 2I. Now canonical coordinates

have the bracket relations,

so the matrix of components of the Poisson tensor is:

where 0 and 1 are the I

×

Using this Poisson tensor in Eq. (2.102), we easily recover the usual expres-

sion for the canonical bracket, Eq. (2.93). Furthermore, this Poisson tensor

is obviously antisymmetric, and it obeys Eq. (2.104) since its components are

constants so their derivatives are all zero.

If we start with canonical coordinates, then a canonical transformation is

any transformation that leaves the Poisson tensor unchanged. If we denote the

Jacobian matrix of the transformation by:

then this condition may be written as the matrix equation:

where the superscript “T ” denotes “transpose,” and J is the canonical Poisson

tensor given by Eq. (2.105). In what follows, we shall generalize the term canon-

ical transformation to mean any bracket-preserving transformation, regardless

of whether or not we started from canonical coordinates.

Thus far, we have said nothing about the equations of motion. For canonical

coordinates these are well known to be:

˙zα = J αβ ∂H
∂zβ .

(2.109)

(2.110)

(2.111)

Alternatively, this may be written in terms of the Poisson tensor:

Since this last equation is in tensor form, and since it is known to hold for canon-

ical coordinates, it must be the correct generalization of the equation of motion

for noncanonical coordinates. Thus, the complete speciﬁcation of a Hamiltonian

system in this new generalized sense requires the speciﬁcation of both a Poisson

tensor and a scalar Hamiltonian.

Any dynamical system on phase space can be expressed in the form ˙zα = V α,

where V is some vector ﬁeld on the phase space. Eq. (2.111) for a Hamiltonian

dynamical system has this form. Note, however, that in order to qualify as

“Hamiltonian,” the vector ﬁeld on the right cannot be just any vector ﬁeld;

it must be given by the Poisson tensor contracted with the gradient of some

scalar function. A vector ﬁeld on phase space is called a Hamiltonian vector

ﬁeld if there exists some scalar ﬁeld for which this is true. Thus, if a manifold is

endowed with a Poisson tensor, then scalar ﬁelds generate Hamiltonian vector

ﬁelds.

2.3.2 An Example of a Noncanonical Poisson Structure

There are several ways that noncanonical Poisson structures can arise in a prob-

lem. The ﬁrst and most obvious way is to start with canonical coordinates and

make a noncanonical transformation. The canonical Poisson tensor is known to

obey Eqs. (2.103) and (2.104), and since these are tensorial equations they will

Mathematical Preliminaries

47

hold in all frames if they hold in any one frame. So the result of a noncanonical

transformation will be a new bracket that obeys all the required properties.

A particularly beautiful example of this has been given by Littlejohn [22] for

the problem of a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld. For canonical coordinates,

q and p, the Hamiltonian is well known to be:

where A(q) is the vector potential. Make the noncanonical transformation to

new coordinates,r and v, where:

The bracket relations among the new coordinates are easily calculated:

Mathematical Preliminaries

This bracket is easily seen to be antisymmetric. That it satisﬁes the Jacobi

identity is less obvious; we know that it must from the arguments given above,

but a direct proof involves some tedious algebra. The new Hamiltonian is simply:

H(r, v) =

m
2

v2,

(2.117)

and it is readily veriﬁed that this Hamiltonian, together with the bracket given in

Eq. (2.116) yield the correct equations of motion. Note that the vector potential

is absent from the new formulation; this is construed as an advantage, since the

vector potential is a gauge-dependent quantity. The above Hamiltonian system

was the starting point for Littlejohn’s work on guiding-center theory [22].

Now that we have seen how noncanonical Poisson structures can arise from

noncanonical transformations of a canonical system, it is natural to ask the op-

posite question: Given a noncanonical Hamiltonian system, is it always possible

to ﬁnd a transformation to canonical coordinates? For noncanonical Hamilto-

nian systems with a nonsingular Poisson tensor (that is, systems for which the

matrix of components of the Poisson tensor is nonsingular), there is an impor-

tant theorem, called Darboux’s theorem, that tells us that the answer is “yes.”

A proof of Darboux’s theorem is given by Littlejohn [22] and is constructive;

that is, it gives a prescription for actually ﬁnding the transformation to canoni-

cal coordinates. For Hamiltonian systems with singular Poisson structures, the

situation is more complicated, and will be discussed shortly.

2.3.3 Reduction

Reduction and Noether’s Theorem

Noncanonical transformations from canonical coordinates is only one of many

ways that interesting Poisson structures can arise naturally. The process of “re-

duction” of a Hamiltonian system with symmetry is another. Work in this area

has been pioneered by Marsden and Weinstein (see, for example, reference [23]).

Mathematical Preliminaries

49

A detailed discussion of reduction would be out of place in this work, but

the general idea is this: Suppose that we have a canonical Hamiltonian system

with a conﬁguration space symmetry (e.g. spatial translation, rotation, etc.).

Make the conﬁguration space symmetry group parameter one of the generalized

coordinates. Noether’s theorem then tells us that the corresponding momentum

is conserved. It is then possible to eliminate this degree of freedom from the sys-

tem, thus reducing the dimensionality of the phase space by two. This much is

familiar from elementary courses in classical mechanics. Reduction is an impor-

tant generalization of Noether’s theorem that allows us to similarly “mod out”

by a symmetry group that acts on all of phase space rather than just conﬁgura-

tion space. After reduction is performed, the resulting Hamiltonian system may

very well be noncanonical.

The set of all phase functions together with the Poisson bracket operation

constitutes a Lie algebra. From a computational point of view, in order to

perform reduction we must ﬁnd a representation for which this Lie algebra has

a closed Lie subalgebra. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian must depend only on

the elements of this subalgebra. The elements of the subalgebra then constitute

coordinates for a reduced description of the problem. This is best illustrated by

example.

The Free Rigid Body

One of the most elementary (but nontrivial) examples of this process is the

Hamiltonian system for a free rigid body. The usual generalized coordinates for

this problem are the Eulerian angles, θ, φ, and ψ, with respect to some ﬁxed

space frame. By introducing their canonically conjugate momenta, pθ, pφ, and

pψ, it is possible to write the equations of motion in a canonical Hamiltonian

format with a six-dimensional phase space. If we choose a body frame for which

the inertia tensor is diagonalized, then the Hamiltonian for the free rigid body

50

problem is

(2.118)

where I1, I2, and I3 are the three diagonal elements of the inertia tensor.

Consider the three components of the angular momentum resolved in the

body frame. These can be expressed in terms of our canonical phase space

coordinates as follows:

m1 = (pφ csc θ

pψ cot θ) sin ψ + pθ cos ψ,

m2 = (pφ csc θ

pψ cot θ) cos ψ

pθ sin ψ,

−

−

m3 = pψ.

(2.119)

(See Goldstein [24] for details. Only the result is needed here.)

By direct calculation with the canonical bracket, we can verify the following

relations

m2, m3}
m3, m1}

{

(2.120)

Thus, the three components of the angular momentum in the body frame con-

stitute a closed Lie subalgebra under the operation of the canonical Poisson

bracket. This means that the subset of functions on the canonical phase space

that are functions of the m’s alone (that is, those functions that depend on θ, φ,

ψ, pθ, pφ, and pψ only through their dependence on the m’s) constitutes a Lie

subalgebra of the Lie algebra of all canonical phase functions.

We thus adopt the m’s as generalized coordinates on a reduced phase space

of three dimensions. The Poisson tensor on this reduced phase space is then

so that the Poisson bracket of any two functions of m, say A and B, is given by:

(cid:18)
This bracket must satisfy all the required properties of a Poisson bracket, since

(cid:19)

it was derived by specializing the domain of a canonical bracket; nevertheless, it

is straightforward and instructive to verify this by direct calculation.

It is possible to perform reduction only if the Hamiltonian is expressible in

terms of the reduced coordinate set. For the free rigid body, we have

As expected, these are indeed Euler’s equations for the free rigid body. If the

rigid body were not free (say, if it were in a gravitational ﬁeld), then a potential

energy term would have been present in the Hamiltonian, and that term would

not have been expressible in terms of the m’s. Thus, the reduction process would

have failed. This is because the gravitational ﬁeld breaks the SO(3) symmetry

that makes the reduction possible.

As we shall see later on in this thesis, the passage from particle coordinates

to guiding-center coordinates is another example of reduction. The symmetry

52

Mathematical Preliminaries

involved is the group of rotations by the gyroangle, SO(2), and the reduction

eliminates the corresponding degree of freedom from the system. If this gyrosym-

metry is somehow broken (say, by a variation in the background ﬁeld conﬁgura-

tion whose length scale is on the order of a gyroradius), then the guiding-center

description is invalidated.

Euler’s Fluid Equations

Our next example is a Hamiltonian ﬁeld theory for Euler’s equations for the

ﬂow of an inviscid, incompressible ﬂuid. Let us adopt a Lagrangian description

for such a ﬂuid wherein each ﬂuid particle is labelled by a reference position,

x0. Then the conﬁguration of the ﬂuid at time t may be speciﬁed by giving the

particle’s current position, x as a function of x0 and t. Thus, our dynamical ﬁeld

variable is x(x0, t). The system Lagrangian consists solely of the kinetic energy

L =

d3x0

˙x2(x0, t),

ρ
2

(2.125)

where ρ is the constant uniform mass density. The canonical momentum ﬁeld is

then given by

p(x0, t) =

= ρ ˙x(x0, t),

(2.126)

δL
δ ˙x(x0, t)

where the δ’s denote functional diﬀerentiation. Performing the Legendre trans-

formation, we see that the system Hamiltonian is

H =

d3x0

p2(x0, t).

2ρ

(2.127)

The canonical bracket of two functionals of x and p, say A and B, is then

(cid:19)

Now suppose that the ﬂuid particles are identical. In that case, speciﬁcation

of x(x0, t) is far more information than is really necessary to determine the

conﬁguration of the ﬂuid. This is because x(x0, t) eﬀectively keeps track of

Z

Mathematical Preliminaries

particle labels; two conﬁgurations that diﬀer only by swapping identical particles

will actually have diﬀerent x(x0, t). For a ﬂuid of identical particles, an Eulerian

description, wherein the ﬂow velocity is given as a function of spatial position and

time, say v(ξ, t), suﬃces to determine the ﬂuid conﬁguration. The Lagrangian

description just keeps track of too much information. Thus, in passing from

the Lagrangian to the Eulerian description, we are eﬀectively reducing by the

group of identical particle interchanges. The Eulerian description is therefore

the reduced description. The reduced phase space is the (smaller, though still

inﬁnite dimensional) space of all divergenceless vector ﬁelds, v, that satisfy the

boundary conditions (v tangential to the boundary). The requirement that

divv = 0 stems from the fact that we are considering only incompressible ﬂows.

So, from a computational point of view, how do we perform this reduction?

Note that the Eulerian velocity ﬁeld may be written in terms of the Lagrangian

ﬁelds as follows:

v(ξ, t) =

p(x−1(ξ, t), t).

(2.129)

ρ

This may be interpreted as follows: If we want the Eulerian velocity at spatial

point ξ, ﬁrst take x−1(ξ, t) to get the reference position of the ﬂuid element

currently at ξ, then evaluate the momentum p of the ﬂuid element with this

reference position, then divide the result by ρ to get the desired answer. Now

the above equation may be written

where we have used the fact that the Jacobian,

, is equal to unity

because the ﬂow is incompressible. Thus we have succeeded in expressing the

reduced ﬁeld variable, v, in terms of the canonical ﬁeld variables, x and p. In

this respect, Eq. (2.130) is the exact analog of Eqs. (2.119) for the free rigid

body problem.

Thus, we can take the Poisson bracket of the Eulerian ﬁeld with itself using

to express this bracket in terms of the Eulerian (reduced) ﬁeld variables alone.

This equation is thus the analog of Eqs. (2.120) for the free rigid body problem.

So we see that the functionals of the Eulerian ﬁeld variables constitute a

closed Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of all phase functionals. We thus adopt

the Eulerian ﬁeld variables as coordinates on a reduced phase space. The Poisson

bracket of any two functionals of v, say A and B, is then calculated by the Leibniz

tricky. Consider a functional A(v). Its equation of motion is

At this point, we might be tempted to set the expression in square brackets

above equal to zero on the grounds that A is an arbitrary functional. This

would, however, be incorrect because δA/δv is not really arbitrary. Recall that

our phase space consists only of those vector ﬁelds that have zero divergence.

This causes an ambiguity in the usual deﬁnition of the functional derivative

which is such that the equation

surface, ˆn, to get

This constitutes a well-posed Neumann problem for p as a functional of v. Thus,

Eq. (2.141), coupled with the constraint of incompressibility, determines both v

and p.

It is intriguing that the equations of motion for both examples considered

thus far are named after Euler; one wonders if he knew about the beautiful

analogy between them.

In fact, the ﬁrst published reference to this analogy

seems to be a 1966 paper of Arnold [25].

The Poisson-Vlasov System

Our ﬁnal example of reduction is also a Hamiltonian ﬁeld theory, this time for the

Poisson-Vlasov equations of plasma physics. For simplicity, we consider a one-

dimensional plasma (the methods are trivially generalized to three dimensions).

Once again, we label particles by their initial conditions. This time, however,

the ﬂow is in phase space, so the initial conditions are r0 and p0, and the present

phase space position is r and p. The dynamical ﬁelds are thus r(r0, p0, t) and

Mathematical Preliminaries

57

p(r0, p0, t). We shall use z to refer to the set of coordinates, r and p, and z0 to

refer to the set of initial conditions, r0 and p0. The ﬁelds may thus be abbreviated

z(z0, t).

The Lagrangian for this system that includes the electrostatic potential en-

ergy of interaction was ﬁrst written down by Low [26]. It is

The canonical momentum ﬁeld is then

Now suppose that the particles are identical. Just as with Euler’s ﬂuid equa-

tions, it turns out that we can reduce to an Eulerian description. This time, the
Eulerian ﬁeld variable is the usual distribution function on phase space, f(Z).

This may be expressed in terms of the Lagrangian ﬁeld variables as follows:

Note the similarity in structure of the brackets for all three of the above

examples. For example, all three have a Poisson tensor that is linear in the

coordinates used. All are examples of what are called Lie-Poisson brackets, and

there is a rich mathematical literature on brackets of this sort (see, for example,

Marsden [23]).

2.3.4 Singular Poisson Structures

There are a few very important observations to be made about the above ex-

amples before we go on to talk about perturbation theory. First consider the

free rigid body problem. Note that the matrix in Eq. (2.121) is singular with

Mathematical Preliminaries

59

rank two for m

= 0, and rank zero for m = 0. Indeed, any odd dimensional

phase space must have a singular Poisson structure, because antisymmetric ma-

trices always have even rank. For these systems, Darboux’s theorem does not

apply and it is not possible to ﬁnd a transformation to canonical coordinates;

of course, this should have been obvious because canonical coordinates always

come in pairs and you can’t pair an odd number of things.

When a system has a singular Poisson structure, the Poisson tensor will have

at least one null eigenvector. Let’s say it has n of them; note that n is equal to

the dimensionality of the phase space, N, minus the rank of the Poisson tensor,

r. In this case, it has been shown by Littlejohn [31] that it is always possible

to ﬁnd a set of n = N

r scalar phase functions whose gradients are those

−

null eigenvectors. This is not at all obvious and requires an application of the

Frobenius theorem of diﬀerential geometry, where use is made of the fact that

the Poisson tensor satisﬁes the Jacobi identity.

These n scalar phase functions are very special in that their bracket with any

other scalar phase function must vanish. This is obvious from Eq. (2.102). Scalar

phase functions with this property are called Casimir functions. In particular,

their bracket with any Hamiltonian is zero, so they are always conserved quan-

tities; note that their conservation follows directly from the bracket structure,

independent of the particular Hamiltonian under consideration.

For the free rigid body problem presented above, the null eigenvector of the

Poisson tensor is any multiple of m itself. The function:

C(m) = m2

1 + m2

2 + m2
3

(2.153)

is then a Casimir function since its gradient is in the direction of m, and we

recognize it as the total angular momentum squared. Of course, any other

scalar phase function that is functionally dependent upon C could have been

used equally well. The pathology at the point m = 0 where the rank of J

6
60

Mathematical Preliminaries

changes is called a symplectic bone, and is discussed at length by Weinstein [32].

If we were to choose C to be one of our generalized coordinates, say the third

coordinate in place of m3, then it is clear that the third row and column of J

would be zero. The two by two submatrix consisting of rows and columns one

and two would be nonsingular, and Darboux’s theorem could be applied to that

subsystem. Thus, the correct generalization of Darboux’s theorem for singular

Poisson structures is to say that it is always possible to ﬁnd a transformation to

a coordinate system for which the matrix of components of the Poisson tensor

has an r by r submatrix in canonical form with the rest of the entries vanishing.

For the free rigid body problem Poisson structure given above, this has the form:

nian. For example, the Hamiltonian:

It is worth repeating that Casimir functions are conserved for any Hamilto-

H(m) = µm3,

(2.155)

where µ is a constant, together with the same bracket used above for the free

rigid body problem, yields the equations of motion for a classical spin gyrating

in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. That is, m1 and m2 undergo simple harmonic oscil-

lations, while m3 is conserved because it commutes with the Hamiltonian. Note

that C is a conserved quantity for this system as well, because the bracket is the

same. In general, the Poisson structure is considered to be a more fundamental

entity than the Hamiltonian.

The other two examples presented in the last subsection also have singu-

lar Poisson structures.

It is readily veriﬁed that the bracket for Euler’s ﬂuid

2.3.5 Phase-Space Lagrangian Techniques

In this section, we review the phase space Lagrangian formalism; for more details

on this subject see Littlejohn [33] and Littlejohn and Cary [34]. For a system

with canonical coordinates, q and p, and time-independent Hamiltonian, H(q, p),

the phase space Lagrangian is given by

Mathematical Preliminaries

We denote by zµ, where µ = 1, . . . , N, (where N = 2I) the coordinates of

phase space. The phase space Lagrangian may then be written

L(z, ˙z) = γµ ˙zµ

H(z),

where the covector whose components are γµ will be called the action one-form.

if µ = I + 1, . . . , N.

the coordinate system is canonical. For more general coordinate systems this

will not be true, as we shall see shortly. Note that phase space Lagrangians

are always linear in ˙z. Also note that knowledge of the action one-form and

the Hamiltonian is completely equivalent to knowledge of the phase space La-

grangian by Eq. (2.162).

For z = (q, p), where q and p are canonically conjugate, it is easily veriﬁed that

Eq. (2.165) is equivalent to Eqs. (2.160) and (2.161).

manner: Assuming that [ωµν ] is a nonsingular matrix, we denote its inverse by

These are recognized as Hamilton’s equations if we identify J µν as the Poisson

where the commas in Eq. (2.171) denote partial diﬀerentiation with respect to

equation of motion is then

Ωµν ˙Zν =

∂K
∂Zµ ,

which may be compared to Eq. (2.165).

Note that all of the above considerations assume a time-independent Hamil-

tonian. This restriction is not important for two reasons: First, we could always

64

Mathematical Preliminaries

work in extended phase space to treat a time-dependent system; this is the ap-

proach taken by Littlejohn and Cary [34]. Second, all of our relativistic equations

of motion will have the single-particle proper time as the independent variable,

and nothing depends explicitly on this.

The transformation

γξ 7→

γξ +

∂S
∂zξ ,

(2.173)

where S is an arbitrary scalar ﬁeld on extended phase space, is called a La-

grangian gauge transformation. Though it alters the action one-form, it is easily

seen to have no eﬀect on the Lagrangian two-form, and so it does not change

the equation of motion, Eq. (2.165).

It is clear that if L is independent of one of the extended phase space coordi-

nates, say zµ, then the associated canonical momentum, ∂L/∂ ˙zµ, is conserved by

Noether’s theorem. Note, however, that a gauge transformation, like Eq. (2.173),

using a scalar ﬁeld, S, that depends upon the ignorable coordinate, could de-

stroy the Noether symmetry, even though the associated momentum would still

be conserved. The same is true for coordinate transformations like Eq. (2.170).

Conversely, we see that it may be necessary to perform gauge or coordinate

transformations in order to uncover Noether symmetries and, hence, to discover

conserved quantities.

The strategy for our treatment of the guiding-center problem will be to start

with the phase space Lagrangian for a single relativistic charged particle in an

electromagnetic ﬁeld, and, via a sequence of gauge and coordinate transforma-

tions, ﬁnd a representation in which the gyroangle, θ, is ignorable. This is the

Noether symmetry for the gyromomentum. When this is achieved, the gyroangle

will no longer appear in the equations of motion for the other variables, and the

magnetic moment will appear only as a constant parameter like the rest mass.

Thus, in this system of “gyrocoordinates,” the rapid oscillatory motion is eﬀec-

tively decoupled from the slower guiding-center motion, and the dimensionality

Mathematical Preliminaries

of our phase space is reduced by two.

2.3.6 Constrained Systems

Eqs. (2.162) and (2.159) may be interpreted as follows: The variation of the

action one form must vanish, subject to the constraint that the Hamiltonian is

constant. By including other constraints, besides the fact that the Hamiltonian

is constant, we can discover new and interesting Poisson structures that have

those other constraints “built in.”

For example, consider a particle that is constrained to move on the surface

of a sphere of radius r. To model this system, we take the canonical action one

form,

γ = p

dr = pxdx + pydy + pzdz,

(2.174)

and vary it subject to the constraints that the Hamiltonian, H, be constant,

that the particle position be on the sphere

2 = x2 + y2 + z2 = r2,

(2.175)

and that the particle momentum be tangent to the sphere

r

p = xpx + ypy + zpz = 0.

(2.176)

The constrained variation may be done in any one of a number of ways; e.g.

by use of Lagrange multipliers. Thus we write

the constraint surface in phase space is simply described by setting pr equal to

Eqs. (2.198) and (2.199) and the Leibniz rule allow us to compute the brackets

for the system of coordinates (r, p) in terms of the brackets for the system of

coordinates (r, θ, φ, pr, pθ, pφ). If we ignore the constraint, then the latter system

is canonical, and it follows that the former system is also canonical. If, on the

other hand, we incorporate the constraint by dictating that r and pr are Casimir

functions and that pr = 0, then the brackets (2.191) follow immediately.

It is interesting to contrast these two methods for obtaining the brackets

(2.191). We shall use these methods when we cast our guiding-center equations

of motion in gyrogauge and boostgauge invariant format, towards the end of

the Chapter 3. Our guiding-center Poisson brackets will also have a quadratic

Poisson structure, similar to that of the above set of brackets. Such quadratic

Poisson structures seem to arise naturally from this type of manipulation. The

reader who is interested in pursuing this topic further is encouraged to read

about Dirac’s theory of constraints [35].

2.4 Lie Transform Perturbation Theory

2.4.1 General Discussion of Lie Transforms

Recall that we ﬁrst introduced coordinates on manifolds using the concepts of

charts and atlases. A chart is a one-to-one map from a region of

n to a region

ℜ

of an n-dimensional manifold. Each coordinate, zα, may thus be thought of

as a function on the manifold. When we change coordinates, we are eﬀectively

transforming these functions.

Consider an inﬁnitesimal transformation of coordinates given by

Zα = zα + h(

Lgz)α = zα + hgα(z),

(2.200)

where h is an inﬁnitesimal, g is a vector ﬁeld, and the Lie derivative acts on the

coordinates as though they were scalar functions. From our geometrical inter-

pretation of the Lie derivative, we see that we are eﬀectively taking the functions

that deﬁne the coordinates, and sliding them an inﬁnitesimal parameter interval,

h, along the ﬁeld lines of g. The inverse transformation is

LgZ)α = Zα
Of course, since h is an inﬁnitesimal, we are scrupulously ignoring anything of

zα = Zα

hgα(Z).

(2.201)

h(

order h2.

Now we ask how basis vector components behave under the above transfor-

mation. Assume a coordinate basis for simplicity. We have

∂

∂Zα

∂
∂zβ =

∂

∂zα −

(2.202)

Similarly, basis covector components transform as follows:

∂Zα
∂zβ dzβ = dzα + h
Now suppose that t is some tensor ﬁeld on the manifold. We can ask how

∂gα
∂zβ dzβ.

dZ α =

(2.203)

the components of t behave under the above transformation. Use a prime to

(cid:1)

Suppose that we deﬁne a new tensor ﬁeld, T, whose components in the old

system are the same as those of t in the new system. Then, by comparison with

Eq. (2.43), we may write

T = t

h(

Lgt),

−

(2.206)

where comparison with Eq. (2.43) is helpful. Furthermore, since this last equa-

tion is in coordinate-free form, it is true for coordinate bases and noncoordinate

bases alike.

Compare the signs of the second terms on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (2.206)

and (2.200). Despite the algebra that went into proving the above result, it has

a marvelously simple geometric interpretation.

If we slide the values of the

coordinates one way along a ﬁeld line of g, then we must slide the tensor ﬁeld in

the other direction. In case this is not obvious, a trivial example is aﬀorded by

a scalar ﬁeld on

, call it f (x). If we transform coordinates to X = x + h, then

F (X) = f ′(X) = f (x) = f (X

h) = f (X)

h(df /dX)(X) = (f

Suppose that our tensor ﬁeld is the tensor product of two tensor ﬁelds, say

(h2). This result indicates that the inﬁnitesimal

where, as always, we neglect

transformation commutes with the tensor product.

Next suppose that the tensor ﬁeld is obtained by starting with a tensor of

higher rank and applying to it some number of vectors and/or covectors. For

example, say t = s(a, U) where a is a covector ﬁeld and U is a vector ﬁeld;

we could have let s have more than one of each type of argument or other

unﬁlled slots without aﬀecting the following reasoning in any way. Apply the

transformation, and use Eq. (2.44) to write

(2.208)

This result indicates that the transformation commutes with the application of

the vectors and/or covectors.

Next suppose that the tensor ﬁeld is an exact form. That is, say t = dΩ.

Since Lie derivatives commute with exterior derivatives, it follows that the trans-

formation commutes with the application of the exterior derivative.

The above results indicate that any tensorial relationship, including those

with diﬀerential operators, retains its form under a transformation of the form

given in Eq. (2.200). This crucial point makes the Lie transform method possible.

Now suppose that we wish to consider ﬁnite (rather than inﬁnitesimal)

changes of coordinates. That is, suppose we wish to slide the coordinate values

a ﬁnite parameter interval, ǫ, along the ﬁeld lines of g. The easiest approach is to

72

divide the ﬁnite interval into a large number of inﬁnitesimal intervals by writing

Z = lim
N→∞

(2.209)

(2.210)

The transformation given by the above equations is called a Lie transform gen-

erated by the vector ﬁeld, g.

Because the inﬁnitesimal transformations of the form given in Eq. (2.200)

are known to preserve tensorial relationships, and because a Lie transform is

composed of nothing more than a large number of these inﬁnitesimal transfor-

mations, it follows that Lie transforms preserve tensorial relationships. That

We now have a way of making ﬁnite coordinate transformations of any tensorial

equation that is guaranteed to preserve its tensorial form.

By Taylor expanding the exponential in Eq. (2.209) and using Eq. (2.30) for

the Lie derivative, it is possible to develop the transformation to arbitrarily high

order in ǫ. In practice, we want to be able to control the transformation order

by order in ǫ. There are two ways to do this. The ﬁrst, due to Deprit [36], is to

order the generator, g, in ǫ. The second, due to Dragt and Finn [37], is to make

a succession of transformations like Eq. (2.209), as follows:

Mathematical Preliminaries

Given any equation written in tensor form, we can now make near-identity

coordinate transformations to perform perturbation analyses. That is, if the

equation has the form of a solvable equation plus a small perturbation, we can

make a Lie transform to coordinates for which the perturbation is removed

or at least simpliﬁed. The form of the generator, g, required to achieve this

simpliﬁcation depends on the speciﬁc problem, and is chosen order by order in

the perturbation series.

Once this process has been carried out to ﬁrst order, we could continue

on to second and higher order, or we could regard the ﬁrst-order problem as a

new solvable problem and renormalize the perturbation series accordingly before

proceeding to higher order. The latter strategy is called the superconvergent Lie

transform procedure; superconvergent perturbation series were ﬁrst investigated

by Kolmogorov [39]. All this will be made clear by selected examples in the next

few subsections.

2.4.2 Lie Transforming a Scalar Field

Consider the scalar equation

f (x) = ǫx2 + 2x

2c = 0,

(2.225)

where c is a constant and ǫ is our expansion parameter. Let’s pretend for a

moment that we do not know how to solve a quadratic equation. The scalar

ﬁeld, f, is ordered in ǫ as follows:

ator, g, has only one component. At order zero, use Eq. (2.221),

F0 = f0.

At order one, use Eq. (2.222),

F1 = f1 −

If we use z to denote (x, y), then this may be written

and V1 is given from Eq. (2.222),

V1 = v1 − Lgv0.

(2.237)

Using the formula for the Lie derivative of a vector, the demand that V1 = 0 is

seen to be equivalent to the following pair of equations:

Note that the characteristic equations for this system are the unperturbed equa-

of problems of this sort.

Now then, the new coordinates are given in terms of the old by

Thus, the solution for z(t) is given by Eqs. (2.241) and (2.243). If desired, the

initial conditions for Z can be expressed in terms of the initial conditions for z

using Eq. (2.240).

Frequently, in physical applications of this formalism, it happens that the new

coordinates have physical signiﬁcance. For example, in guiding-center theory, we

78

Mathematical Preliminaries

shall ﬁnd a Lie transform that takes us from the phase space coordinates of a

particle to those of a guiding center. In such a circumstance, very little is gained

by expressing the initial conditions of the transformed problem in terms of those

of the original problem. Instead, the new coordinates acquire their own physical

signiﬁcance, and we can speak of “the equations of motion of a guiding center”

and “the initial conditions of a guiding center,” and forget all about the original

single-particle coordinates.

For a less trivial example of the vector Lie transform technique, see Ap-

pendix C where the method is used to calculate the gyrofrequency shift for

two-dimensional nonrelativistic guiding-center motion in a spatially nonuniform

electromagnetic ﬁeld.

2.4.4 Canonical Lie Transforms of a Hamiltonian System

When using perturbation theory to study a Hamiltonian dynamical system, the

above technique of Lie transforming the dynamical vector ﬁeld could be used,

but there is a serious problem with this approach: There is no guarantee that the

Lie transform of a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld will be another Hamiltonian vector

ﬁeld.

Recall that a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld is given by contracting the Poisson

tensor with the gradient of a scalar function. This suggests the following solution

to the above problem: Instead of Lie transforming the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld,

Lie transform the Poisson tensor and Hamiltonian separately. This will insure

that the transformed equations of motion are still in Hamiltonian form.

Let us examine a little more closely why this should work. Hamiltonian

equations of motion are given by Eq. (2.111). If we write

Z = exp(ǫ

)z,

J′ = exp(

)J,

L
ǫ
L
−

Mathematical Preliminaries

and

79

(2.244)

(2.245)

(2.246)

(2.247)

then since our equations of motion are in tensor form, we are guaranteed that

the new equations of motion will be

H ′ = exp(

)H,

ǫ
L
−

˙Z = J′

∂H ′
∂Z

.

·

Furthermore, we are guaranteed that J′ is antisymmetric and obeys the Jacobi

identity because these requirements can also be written as tensorial equations

(see Eqs. (2.103) and (2.104), respectively). Thus, Eq. (2.245) qualiﬁes as a bona

ﬁde Hamiltonian system.

We can now prove a marvelous theorem that considerably simpliﬁes the

work involved in making canonical (bracket-preserving) Lie transformations of

a Hamiltonian system, and is probably responsible for the popularity of the Lie

transform technique: A Poisson tensor is a Lie-dragged tensor along any vec-

tor ﬁeld that is Hamiltonian with respect to it. Suppose the Poisson tensor is

denoted by J. Let V be given by

for some (any) scalar ﬁeld, W. Then the theorem states

V α = J αβ ∂W
∂zβ

LV J = 0.

This is easily proved using the formula for the Lie derivative of a second rank

contravariant tensor. We write

(2.248)

80

Mathematical Preliminaries

where we have used Eq. (2.246) for V. The ﬁrst term vanishes by the Jacobi

identity, the second term vanishes by antisymmetry, and the theorem is proved.

It immediately follows that a Lie transform along the vector ﬁeld V leaves

J unchanged. This is because a Lie transform is the exponentiation of a Lie
Lmtn = 0 in Eqs. (2.221) through (2.224) to recover T = t).
Thus, Lie transforms generated by Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds are always canoni-

derivative (set

cal. Now Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds are in one-to-one correspondence with scalar

phase functions, W, by Eq. (2.246), so we have found a way to generate canonical

transformations with scalars.

Thus, to perform a canonical Lie transform of a Hamiltonian system, we

(2.264)

Note how the Lie transform has taken us to a new set of coordinates in which

the perturbation is averaged; that is, independent of the angle variable. Since

the resulting Hamiltonian depends only on the action variable, it is integrable

by deﬁnition. Furthermore, secular terms were avoided by this absorbing of the

averaged part of the perturbation into the new Hamiltonian.

Aforementioned problems of resonant perturbations occur when the unper-

turbed motion has characteristic frequencies that vary with the action (this is

true generically, but not in our above example). When this happens, ∂W1/∂θ

can equal a quantity that is oscillatory but whose frequency passes through zero

on some set of measure zero in phase space. Thus, in some neighborhood of this

region, problems of secular behavior can develop. Various techniques exist for

dealing with this problem, but we shall not consider such problematic regions of

phase space in this thesis.

2.4.5 Noncanonical Lie Transforms of a Hamiltonian Sys-

tem

It sometimes happens that a canonical transformation is not the best way to

solve a particular problem in perturbation theory. This may be because it is

best to express the unperturbed problem in noncanonical coordinates for which

the perturbation alters not only the Hamiltonian but also the Poisson struc-

ture. This is the case for both the guiding-center and oscillation-center problems

whose solution forms the core of this thesis. In this case, we must resort to non-

canonical transformations, but we demand that they preserve the Hamiltonian

nature of the equations of motion. As has already been pointed out, this can

Mathematical Preliminaries

83

be accomplished by Lie transforming the Poisson tensor along with the Hamil-

tonian; this means that the vector generator of the Lie transform should not be

a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld.

Consider once again the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian,

This time, we introduce a perturbation not in the Hamiltonian but rather in the

Poisson structure. Suppose that the perturbed brackets are

Thus we have J = J0 + ǫJ1, where J0 is the canonical Poisson tensor. We wish

to perform a Lie transform that will restore the bracket to its canonical form.

2.4.6 Lie Transforming the Phase-Space Lagrangian

There is another way to go about making noncanonical transformations of a

Hamiltonian system that is guaranteed to keep it Hamiltonian. Recall that

specifying the action one form is equivalent to specifying the Poisson tensor

(assuming that everything is nonsingular). We can simply take the exterior

derivative of γ to get ω, and then invert ω to get J. These are all tensorial

relationships, so we could just as well Lie transform γ and H instead of J and

H.

Indeed, there are several advantages to this approach. First, it is easier to

take Lie derivatives of one forms than of second rank contravariant tensors; there

is one less term to worry about, and, more importantly, we can use the homotopy

formula to help us Lie diﬀerentiate one forms. Second, when we Lie transform

the Poisson tensor, we are guaranteed that the resulting tensor will be a valid

Poisson structure only to the order we are keeping. When we Lie transform the

action one form on the other hand, its exterior derivative is still going to be

closed even if we truncate it. Thus ω is exactly closed, so J = ω−1 will obey the

Jacobi identity exactly.

Consider a Lie transformation of the original action one form, γ, into a new

action one form, Γ. Using the homotopy formula, Eqs. (2.221) through (2.224)

Thus, these last transformation equations are capable of dealing with any

shall use in the sections to follow. The vectors gn and the scalars Sn will be

determined by certain desiderata: We want the transformation to average away

the rapidly oscillating terms of the Hamiltonian and action one-form, and we

want to avoid secular terms. For the guiding-center problem, we shall also want

the action one-form to be invariant with respect to certain transformations called

gyrogauge and boostgauge transformations. This will be explained in more detail

For now, we consider another simple example. Consider once again the har-

Relativistic Guiding-Center

Chapter 3

Theory

3.1 Discussion

Relativistic guiding-center motion occurs in many applications of plasma physics,

including controlled fusion, free-electron lasers, and astrophysics. The tandem

mirror and bumpy torus plasma conﬁnement devices, for example, utilize pop-

ulations of magnetized electrons at relativistic energies in complicated ﬁeld-line

geometries. In free-electron lasers, relativistic electron beams travel along strong

magnetic ﬁelds with superposed wiggler ﬁelds. Near a neutron star, relativistic

plasma can be conﬁned in strong electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds.

All these examples point out the need for a formalism that is able to treat gen-

eral electromagnetic ﬁeld geometries. Particle simulation codes used for studying

the properties of guiding-center plasmas in controlled fusion conﬁnement devices

sometimes require the guiding-center equations of motion to one order higher

than the usual drifts; this indicates the need for a simpliﬁed and systematic

perturbative treatment, such as that aﬀorded by the use of Lie transforms. The

87

88

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

free-electron laser problem has no obvious preferred frame of reference, and this

suggests that a manifestly covariant description would best reveal the essence of

the physical processes involved. The neutron star problem involves coupling to

a general relativistic gravitational ﬁeld, and this absolutely requires a manifestly

covariant formulation. All these desiderata will be satisﬁed by our theory.

Nonrelativistic theories of guiding-center motion in arbitrary magnetic ge-

ometry frequently make use of orthonormal triads of unit vectors at each point

of three-dimensional physical space. One member of each such triad is required

to lie in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld at that point. Such a basis aﬀords

great clarity and relative ease in the computation and exposition of the results

of guiding-center theory.

One of the ﬁrst problems to be addressed in any relativistic formulation of

guiding-center theory is thus that of ﬁnding the relativistic analogs of these basis

triads. Fortunately, this problem has been solved by Fradkin [13], who gives a

straightforward method for ﬁnding orthonormal tetrads of unit vectors at each

point of four-dimensional spacetime.

In a frame for which the perpendicular

electric ﬁeld vanishes, one pair of unit vectors in these tetrads lies perpendicular

to the magnetic ﬁeld, while the other pair spans the two-dimensional subspace

determined by the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld and the direction of time.

Fradkin shows that these two two-dimensional subspaces are covariantly de-

ﬁned, and that the rapid gyration takes place in the ﬁrst of these, while the slower

parallel motion takes place in the second. This formalism is therefore useful for

isolating the oscillatory motion so that it can be eﬀectively averaged to obtain

the guiding-center equations of motion. It is described from ﬁrst principles in

Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.

Lie transform perturbation theory is used to perform the averaging. Though

this technique has been known for some time [40], its use for the guiding-center

problem poses special diﬃculties which were ﬁrst overcome by Littlejohn [22].

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

89

The diﬃculties are due to the fact that the Poisson structure as well as the

Hamiltonian depends upon the rapidly gyrating variables, so that the transfor-

mation required to gyroaverage the system of equations is not canonical.

A Lie transform in its most general sense is a coordinate transformation

generated by a vector ﬁeld on phase space.

If this vector ﬁeld generator is a

Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld (that is, a vector ﬁeld that is the ﬂow generated by some

scalar Hamiltonian-like function) then the transformation it induces is canonical;

in this case one often simply speaks of the transformation as being generated

by the corresponding scalar function. For the guiding-center problem, however,

the vector generator of the averaging transformation cannot be a Hamiltonian

vector ﬁeld, since it must generate a noncanonical transformation.

In the nonrelativistic guiding-center problem, it was found by Littlejohn [7]

to be easiest to apply the general Lie transform to the action one form. This

is the approach that is followed here; it was described from ﬁrst principles in

Chapter 2.

In any calculation that goes beyond the lowest order drifts, it was found

by Littlejohn [41] to be necessary to worry about maintaining a certain gauge

invariance property of the action one form which for the nonrelativistic case is

known as gyrogauge invariance. If the averaging transformation does not preserve

this invariance property, then the ﬁnal guiding-center equations of motion will

depend unavoidably on the arbitrarily chosen basis vectors used to set up the

problem, as was noted by Hagan and Frieman [42]. In Section 3.6, we work out

the relativistic generalization of this invariance property, and we ﬁnd that the

relativistic case admits another similar gauge invariance property which we call

boostgauge invariance.

The Lie transforms are carried out in Sections 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9, and the

guiding-center Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are presented. The Poisson bracket

structure is then given in Section 3.10 and the equations of motion are pre-

90

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

sented and discussed in Section 3.11. In Section 3.12, a complete summary of

the transformation equations is given for reference and the correction to the

gyromomentum is derived. In Section 3.13, we show how to write our results in

“1 + 3” notation, and we compare our results to those of Northrop [43]. In Sec-

tion 3.14 we cast all our results in manifestly gyrogauge and boostgauge invariant

format.

3.2 Conventions and Notation

In this work, we adopt the following conventions: The particle space-time co-

ordinate will be denoted by rµ, where µ = 0, . . . , 3. The Minkowski metric,

gµν = diag(

1, +1, +1, +1), is used throughout our derivation of the guiding-

center equations, but the results will be written in manifestly covariant form so

that this assumption can be relaxed. The four potential is given by Aµ = (φ, A),

We have thus decomposed the tangent space at each point of space-time into

the Cartesian product of two two-dimensional “two-ﬂats.” The rapid gyromotion

takes place in the perpendicular two-ﬂat since it is spanned by the eigenvectors

corresponding to the imaginary eigenvalues, while the parallel motion takes place

in the parallel two-ﬂat since it is spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to

the real eigenvalues. These two-ﬂats will play an indispensible role in our theory.

We shall use them to isolate the gyrational components of the particle velocity

in preparation for the guiding-center Lie transform.

Clearly such a tetrad is not unique; it is deﬁned only to within an arbitrary rota-

tion in the perpendicular two-ﬂat, and an arbitrary hyperbolic rotation (boost)

in the parallel two-ﬂat. We shall have much more to say about this nonunique-

ness later; for now we are simply looking for a way to construct any such tetrad.

From the arguments presented in the last section, we know that one way to

do this is to examine the eigenvectors of the ﬁeld tensor. Here we shall take a

diﬀerent approach that is perhaps more physically motivated. Recall that we

are dealing with ﬁelds for which Ek = 0 (if this is true in any one frame, it will

be true in all frames because E

B is a Lorentz scalar). There exist a set of

·

local “preferred” reference frames for which E⊥ also vanishes; hence there is no

electric ﬁeld at all in these preferred frames. Thus, in a preferred frame, the

ﬁeld tensors may be written in “1 + 3” notation as follows:

where τ 1 and τ 2 are unit three-vectors perpendicular to b, such that

{

the above choice is not unique.

Of course, we would like to be able to construct an orthonormal basis tetrad

in an arbitrary Lorentz frame. To see how to do this, we consider a Lorentz

boost from the above-described preferred frame to a new frame. The Lorentz

transformation matrix for a boost is

At this point, there are a number of interesting observations to be made.

First note that if β is parallel to B then E′ = 0, so the transformation takes us

to another preferred frame. Next note that if β is perpendicular to B then B

is parallel to B′. Next note that it is possible to arrive at any desired E′ by a

transformation with β perpendicular to B. Speciﬁcally, if we take

then it is easy to see that the new electric ﬁeld is E′. Conversely, if we begin

with a frame in which the (perpendicular) electric ﬁeld is E′, then a Lorentz

boost with β = βE gets us to a preferred frame.

allow us to isolate the rapid gyrational motion in the perpendicular two-ﬂat

this is why they can be determined by the three components of βv. Naturally,

the above transformation equations depend upon the choice we made for the

unit tetrad. This arbitrariness will be discussed further in Section 3.6. These

transformation equations will be most useful when we want to compare our

results to those of other authors who have used “1 + 3” notation; this will be

done in Section 3.13.

3.5 Phase Space Lagrangian for a Charged Par-

ticle in an Electromagnetic Field

For a relativistic charged particle in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, one possible choice

for the Hamiltonian, H, in canonical coordinates, (q, p), is given by [44]

and the action one form for canonical coordinates is, by Eq. (2.163)

H(q, p) =

·

Note that the independent variable is the particle’s proper time; the equations

of motion are thus of the form of Eq. (2.165), but the dot in that equation now

denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to proper time.

We begin by making a noncanonical transformation to the new coordinates

(r, u), where

Thus we have eliminated the unphysical canonical momentum, p, in favor of the

particle velocity, u. The new Hamiltonian is

If we now use Eq. (3.342) to eliminate the four components of u in favor of

(k, β, w, θ), then the new Hamiltonian is

(3.370)

It is important to remember that ˆt and ˆb are functions of r and β, and ˆc and

(cid:16)

ˆa are functions of r and θ. Thus, the second term in the parenthesis on the

right hand side of Eq. (3.370) is rapidly oscillating due to its dependence on θ

(this will be made more precise shortly). We are now ready to apply the Lie

transform procedure that will eﬀectively average H ′′ and γ′′ by transforming to

gyrocoordinates in which θ is ignorable.

3.6 Gyrogauge and Boostgauge Transformations

We now discuss the afore-mentioned arbitrariness in choosing the orthonormal

unit vectors, ˆeα. A boostgauge transformation replaces our choices for ˆe0 and ˆe1

as follows:

while a gyrogauge transformation replaces our choices for ˆe2 and ˆe3 as follows:

ˆe′
0 = ˆe0 cosh Φ(r)

ˆe1 sinh Φ(r),

ˆe′
1 = ˆe1 cosh Φ(r)

ˆe0 sinh Φ(r),

ˆe′
2 = ˆe2 cos Ψ(r) + ˆe3 sin Ψ(r),

ˆe′
3 = ˆe3 cos Ψ(r)

ˆe2 sin Ψ(r).

−

−

(3.371)

(3.372)

(3.373)

(3.374)

Note that the new unit vectors are still orthonormal, that ˆe0 and ˆe1 still span

the parallel two-ﬂat, and that ˆe2 and ˆe3 still span the perpendicular two-ﬂat.

The gyrogauge and boostgauge transformations have simply given each of these

two pairs of unit vectors a rotation within its respective two-ﬂat. The amount of

rotation is measured by Φ in the parallel two-ﬂat, and by Ψ in the perpendicular

two-ﬂat. Note that these can be functions of the particle’s spacetime position,

r.

106

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

Recall that we used the unit tetrad to decompose the particle velocity into

parallel and perpendicular parts, and to coordinatize these by (k, β) and (w, θ),

respectively. It is fairly easy to see that the transformation given by Eqs. (3.371)

through (3.374) will have no eﬀect on k and w, but will shift β and θ. Hence,

we add

to our boostgauge transformation equations, and

β′ = β + Φ(r)

θ′ = θ + Ψ(r)

(3.375)

(3.376)

to our gyrogauge transformation equatons. None of the other phase space coor-

dinates are aﬀected by the transformations.

Equations (3.371) through (3.376) constitute the full gyrogauge and boost-

gauge transformation equations. A quantity that is left unchanged by these

transformation equations will be said to be gyrogauge or boostgauge invariant,

respectively. The concept of gyrogauge invariance has a nonrelativistic analog

which was ﬁrst discussed by Littlejohn [41]. In the remainder of this section, we

shall extend his methods to our relativistic problem.

To begin with, we note that the unit vectors (ˆt, ˆb, ˆc, ˆa) are all gyrogauge and

boostgauge invariant. This is demonstrated for ˆt as follows:

ˆt′ = ˆe′

0 cosh β′ + ˆe′

1 sinh β′

= (ˆe0 cosh Φ

ˆe1 sinh Φ) cosh(β + Φ) + (ˆe1 cosh Φ

ˆe0 sinh Φ) sinh(β + Φ)

−

= ˆe0[cosh Φ cosh(β + Φ)

sinh Φ sinh(β + Φ)]

−

sinh Φ cosh(β + Φ) + cosh Φ sinh(β + Φ)]

−

+ˆe1[

−

= ˆe0 cosh β + ˆe1 sinh β

= ˆt;

(3.377)

the demonstration for the other three unit vectors follows similarly. Because the

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

107

parallel and perpendicular projection operators may be written in the form of

Eqs. (3.353) and (3.354), their gyrogauge and boostgauge invariance is manifest.

The fact that the quantities above are gyrogauge and boostgauge invariant

means that they may be expressed in terms of purely physical tensor quantities;

more precisely, they may be expressed in terms of quantities that are completely

independent of our choice of the orientation of the basis tetrad, ˆeα, at each point

in spacetime. For example, Pk and P⊥ can be expressed in terms of the ﬁeld

tensor, as was done in Eqs. (3.304) and (3.305). The gyrogauge and boostgauge

invariant quantities k and w can be written in terms of the projection operators

and the particle four-velocity with the help of Eq. (3.342)

Finally, the members of the tetrad (ˆt, ˆb, ˆc, ˆa) can all be expressed in terms of the

We now ask what it means for a general one-form in our phase space to

be boostgauge and gyrogauge invariant. Using Eq. (2.170), we ﬁnd that the r

component of the one-form transforms as follows:

Γr =

(3.389)

while all of the other components (k, β, w, and θ) are unchanged. Thus it is clear

that the charged particle Hamiltonian and action one form given by Eqs. (3.369)

and (3.370) are boostgauge and gyrogauge invariant, since they have no β or θ

components.

Now we demand that our Lie transformations, when applied to gauge invari-

ant quantities, preserve their gauge invariance. This, coupled with the estab-

lished boostgauge and gyrogauge invariance of the particle action one-form, will

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

guarantee the boostgauge and gyrogauge invariance of the guiding-center action

one-form. Suppose that we have a boostgauge and gyrogauge invariant scalar

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

Using the homotopy formula, it is a straightforward exercise to show that this

result is valid not only for gauge invariant scalars, but also for any gauge invariant

n-form. In particular, this restriction on the form of g is necessary to guarantee

the gauge invariance of the Lie transformed action one-form, so we shall demand

that it hold in the sections to follow.

3.7 The Zero-Order Problem

We order the particle Hamiltonian and action one-form with the prescription

e/ǫ; equivalently, we could say that we are ordering the electromagnetic ﬁeld

e

7→

at order ǫ−1. The electromagnetic contribution to the canonical momentum thus

dominates the kinetic contribution. This ordering procedure has been discussed

at length by Kruskal [45] and by Littlejohn [41].

We shall also order the four potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the

parameter ǫ, so

Clearly, this induces an ordering of the ﬁeld itself

where

Henceforth, when we refer to the Lorentz scalars (λ1, λ2, λE and λB) or to the

unit basis tetrads or to the projection operators, it is to be understood that they

are calculated on the basis of the zero order ﬁeld tensor, F0.

The Hamiltonian, Eq. (3.369), is thus an order unity scalar. The particle

action one-form, Eq. (3.370), may be written

˙r = 0.

F0 ·

Now we know that ˙t is never zero, so F0 must have at least one null eigenvector

with nonzero time component. In particular, this must be true in a preferred

frame, for which βE = 0. Thus the parallel two-ﬂat must be the nullspace of F0.

So we demand that

λE = 0,

(3.404)

where we again emphasize that λE is computed from Eqs. (3.282), (3.287),

(3.288) and (3.292) using F0 in place of F. This is a restriction on the allowed zero

order ﬁelds. It is the relativistic analog of the usual nonrelativistic restriction

that Ek = 0 to lowest order. Recall that we used this assumption in Section 3.4

when we ﬁrst discussed the basis tetrads.

112

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

Thus, when we order the four potential in ǫ, we must keep in mind that the

ﬁeld derived from A0 should have no Ek. If we have a problem in which there is

nonzero Ek, then it must be included in An where n

1. In particular, it could

all be put into A1. The only reason for keeping An where n

is that sometimes a problem admits another expansion parameter in the ﬁeld

geometry (the stellarator expansion parameter and the long-thin parameter in

mirrors are examples), and in some asymptotic theories that other expansion

parameter may be taken to be equal to the guiding-center expansion parameter.

In such cases, one might want to expand the ﬁeld in a general power series in ǫ,

rather than just restrict oneself to the use of A0 and A1.

Thus, Eq. (3.403) constitutes only two independent conditions on the four

components of ˙r. Dotting it with ˆc and ˆa and using Eq. (3.350) gives ˆc

˙r = ˆa

˙r =

·

·

0, so ˙r must lie in the parallel two-ﬂat; that is, the particle motion is constrained

to lie along the ﬁeld lines like that of a bead sliding along a wire. The rapid

oscillatory motion is then considered to be a modiﬁcation to this motion along

the ﬁeld lines, to be transformed away except for the residual perpendicular

drifting motion.

What is perhaps most disturbing about Eq. (3.403) is that it gives only two

dynamical equations of motion when there are really eight independent phase

space coordinates. It gives us no description of the motion along the ﬁeld lines,

and no description of the rate of change of the velocity components. This is

because the matrix of components of the zero order Lagrangian two-form is a

eight by eight matrix whose rank is only two. This is thus an example of a

problem in asymptotics with no well-deﬁned limit problem; this phenomenon is

by no means rare and has been discussed in a general context by Kruskal [46].

To get a better idea of what is going on here, we should consider the full

particle equations of motion, retaining the lowest order nonzero contributions to

This makes it clear that the dominant motion at lowest order is the gyration,

in accordance with our intuition. Thus, as ǫ

0, we have the rate of change

→

of θ dominating that of all the other dynamical variables, including r. Hence,

averages over the unperturbed motion will simply be averages over θ.

Note that in order to get this zero order equation of motion, we needed γr

only to order ǫ−1, while all the other components of γ were needed to order

unity. This peculiar mixing of orders persists to higher order; so to obtain the

n-th order guiding-center equations of motion, we will need γr only to order

n

1, while all the other components of γ will be needed to order n.

3.8 The Preparatory Lie Transform

All treatments of guiding-center motion share one feature in common: In the

transformation from particle position, r, to guiding-center position, R, they all

include the term,

wˆa/ΩB. This is the gyroradius vector, and it is the most

−

intuitive term in the entire guiding-center transformation (indeed, one might

argue that it is the only intuitive term in the entire guiding-center transforma-

tion). We shall make this transformation before we do anything else, as this was

found to facilitate the remainder of the calculation in Littlejohn’s nonrelativistic

treatment [7].

From Eqs. (2.30) and (2.215), we see that, to ﬁrst order, the diﬀerence be-

tween z and Z is simply given by the components of the generator vector, g. So

since we want to have R = r

wˆa/ΩB, we see that we should choose

−

gr
p =

w
ΩB

−

ˆa,

where the subscript “p” denotes “preparatory.”

Now gr

p is clearly boostgauge and gyrogauge invariant, but from Eq. (3.394)

we see that a Lie transform generated by this vector alone would not preserve

the gauge invariance of the action one-form. Consequently, we must append the

following additional components to gp:

the transformation generated by this vector. This transformation takes place at

115

ﬁrst order only, so we may set g1 = gp and g2 = g3 = 0 in those equations. Also,

since we are interested in calculating the guiding-center equations of motion to

third order (this turns out to be one order higher than the usual perpendicular

drifts), we do not need Γ3r.

At zero order, we have the obvious

This has the single nonzero component,

Γ0 = γ0.

Γ0r =

A0.

e
c

The corresponding Lagrangian two-form, ω0, was given in Eq. (3.402).

Moving on to ﬁrst order, it is readily found that ipω0 (where, in keeping with

past convention, ip ≡

igp ) has only one nonzero component,

We take S1 = 0, so Eq. (2.273) gives the following nonzero component for Γ1:

Note that the aforementioned rapidly oscillating term, mwˆc, has been removed

Note that Γ2r has rapidly oscillating terms; these will be removed by subse-

quent Lie transforms. Also note the appearance of the gyromomentum as the θ

component of Γ2.

Moving on to third order, we recall that we do not need Γ3r. Referring to

Eq. (2.275), it is easily seen that γ3 and ipω2 both have only an r-component, so
we do not bother with these terms. Then 1

3.9 The Averaging Lie Transforms

We now perform the averaging Lie transformations that will take us to the

guiding-center action one-form. These are somewhat more diﬃcult than the

preparatory transformation, since we do not know the generators in advance.

For economy of notation, we reset our variables as follows: We shall henceforth

refer to the Hamiltonian and action one-form that resulted from the preparatory

transformation as H ′′ and γ, respectively, and these new Lie transforms will take

and the only nonzero component of this is

Γ0r =

A0.

e
c

(3.439)

The corresponding Lagrangian two-form, ω0, was given in Eq. (3.402); its only

nonzero component was ω0rr.
At order one, we take gr

1 = 0 and S1 = 0 because we have already succeeded

in averaging Γ1r by the preparatory transformation, and we don’t want to ruin

this. It follows that i1ω0 = 0, and so Γ1 = γ1. The only nonvanishing component

of Γ1 is then

Γ1r =

A1 + mkˆt.

c

(3.440)

Note that we have not yet had to specify gk

1 , gβ

1 , gw

1 , or gθ

1, since it is clear that

these have no eﬀect on Γ1. These components of g1 will be useful in the averaging

of Γ2. Also note that Ω1 = ω1 is given by Eqs. (3.427) through (3.429).

A word of caution is in order concerning the coordinate τ. It is not altered

in any way by the transformation. This means that after we complete the

transformation to guiding-center coordinates, τ will still be the single-particle

proper time; it will not be the guiding-center proper time. So gµνdrµdrν =

This is the form of the guiding-center Hamiltonian and action one form that will

be used in subsequent sections. Note that the order ǫ term in the Hamiltonian

may be neglected if only the classical drifts (usual gradient, polarization and

curvature drifts) are desired.

Here we have drawn a distinction between two cases, just as we did with the

Hamiltonian. Terms of classical order are all that are necessary to retain if only

the usual gradient, curvature and polarization drifts are desired. If one would

like the equations of motion to one order higher than that, one must also retain

the terms labelled higher order. This makes a diﬀerence only in ΩRµ and in the

deﬁnition of F ′.

Now we can get the Poisson brackets using Eq. (2.168). We do this by

inverting the eight by eight matrix consisting of the components of Ω. This is a

tedious but straightforward exercise, and the nonvanishing results are presented

below. We have performed this matrix inversion for both the classical-order and

the higher-order cases separately.

R is nonzero because R is really four coordinates; thus

R, R

is a four by four

{

}

antisymmetric matrix and, consequently, its diagonal elements vanish but the

rest of it may be nonzero.

Note that Θ and µ are decoupled from the other dynamical variables at the

classical order, but that Θ is not decoupled at higher order. The reason for

this will be clariﬁed shortly, but for now we note that this coupling is not at

all problematic. The important point is that the set of functions of R, K and

form a subset of the set of all phase functions that is a closed Lie subalgebra

B
under the operation of these Poisson brackets. Then, since our Hamiltonian is

independent of Θ, we can eliminate that degree of freedom and still have a valid

Hamiltonian system for guiding centers. This is an example of the reduction of

a Hamiltonian system, discussed in Chapter 2.

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

127

Next note that we could have expanded all of the above expressions in pure

power series in ǫ. For example, Υ appears in the denominators of several brackets,

and consists of an order one term and an order ǫ term. One might argue that,

since our expressions are valid only to a certain power of ǫ anyway, we ought to

expand this in powers of ǫ. There is, however, a compelling reason not to do this:

The above brackets are guaranteed to obey the Jacobi identity exactly because

they are elements of the inverse matrix of the matrix of components of the

Lagrange tensor which obeys dΩ = ddΓ = 0. If we were to expand the brackets in

ǫ, and retain ǫ only to a certain power, then the Jacobi identity would be satisﬁed

only to that power of ǫ. Now one might counter that in an asymptotic theory of

this nature, that is all we have a right to demand. In practice, however, guiding-

center equations of motion are often integrated numerically, and violations of

the Jacobi identity invalidate Liouville’s theorem which guarantees phase space

area preservation. This, in turn, can lead to an observed “fuzziness” of KAM

tori which might cause one to draw erroneous conclusions about the presence of

stochasticity.

To elaborate on this last point, in studies of mirror-conﬁned plasmas, for

example, one might integrate the guiding-center equations numerically and pro-

duce a “puncture plot” of the places where the trajectory of the guiding center

intersects the midplane of the device. If such a plot exhibits stochasticity, one

might well expect the radial transport of the plasma to be enhanced signiﬁcantly

as compared to a case for which the plot is a smooth KAM surface. Thus, in a

study of mirror plasma radial transport, one might vary some parameter to see

for what value this transition from regular to stochastic motion takes place. The

decision might be made by comparing the numerically-generated puncture-plots

for several diﬀerent parameter values in some range. Yet if one uses guiding-

center equations of motion that do not satisfy Liouville’s theorem exactly, one

runs the risk of misinterpreting “fuzziness” in plots that is due only to violations

128

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

of Liouville’s theorem (which is, after all, the only reason that KAM tori exist

in the ﬁrst place) as the presence of true stochasticity.

This is why we inverted the Lagrange tensor for the classical and the higher-

order cases separately, rather than do a single inversion for the higher-order case

and truncate to get the classical case. As things stand, the brackets for both

cases presented above are guaranteed to satisfy the Jacobi identity exactly.

3.11 Guiding-Center Equations of Motion

These brackets together with the Hamiltonian, Eq. (3.488), give the guiding-

center equations of motion according to Eq. (2.169). First consider the equation
for ˙R. To the classical order, this may be written

ǫ contribution consists of two parts: The ﬁrst contains the relativistic analog

of the curvature and polarization drifts (they are in F ′′), and the second is the

relativistic analog of the grad-B drift; these statements will be clariﬁed when

we cast these results in “1 + 3” notation. Of course, the above apparatus is
˙R to one order higher than this, but the expression itself is

suﬃcient to get

rather unenlightening to look at, so we shall not bother to write it down.

The terms containing

ΩB contain the mirroring force, and the contribution of

F1 contains the force due to the parallel electric ﬁeld; once again, these state-

ments will be clariﬁed when we cast these results in “1 + 3” notation.

Next note that ˙µ is exactly zero, even at the higher order; this, of course,

was our aim all along. The higher order equation of motion for Θ is

The ﬁrst term is the lowest-order gyromotion. The second term arises from

the bracket structure, and corrects for the possibility that as the guiding-center

moves in R, the perpendicular unit vectors upon which the deﬁnition of Θ is

based may rotate within the perpendicular two-ﬂat. This term arose from our

demand of boostgauge and gyrogauge invariance, and it is the reason that the

Poisson bracket of Θ with R, K, and

cannot vanish at higher order. The neces-

B

sity of this has been discussed by Littlejohn [41] and by Hagan and Frieman [42].

The third term on the right side of Eq. (3.511) arises from the ﬁrst-order piece

of the Hamiltonian and consists of two subterms in the square brackets. The

ﬁrst of these subterms is the correction to the gyrofrequency due to F1. To see
this, deﬁne the total gyrofrequency due to both F0 and F1 by ΩBT ≡
where λBT is given by Eq. (3.293). We quickly ﬁnd

(3.512)

The second subterm of the third term on the right of Eq. (3.511) is the gy-

rofrequency shift due to gradients of the perpendicular electric ﬁeld. This is not

130

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

expected to be obvious, and will be discussed further in Section 3.13, when we

cast our results in “1 + 3” notation.

The geometrical signiﬁcance of the second term in Eq. (3.511) is illustrated

in Fig. 3.2 (here we temporarily revert to using lower-case r and θ). In order

to compare the unit tetrad at one point in spacetime, r, with that at another

point, r + δr, (to see how much it rotated) we need some way of transporting

the unit vectors from one point to another. The correct way of doing this was

elucidated by Littlejohn [41]. Since we have assumed ﬂat spacetime throughout

this calculation, we can simply translate the unit vector ˆe2 from r to r + δr in

the usual manner of Euclidean geometry. Of course, when we arrive at r + δr,

the translated unit vector, called ˆe∗

2, will not be the same as the unit vector ˆe2.

Furthermore, it need not even lie in the perpendicular two-ﬂat. To remedy this,

we project it onto the perpendicular two-ﬂat and normalize the result to get a

new unit vector, called ˆe∗∗

2 . The angle between ˆe2 and ˆe∗∗

2 at the point r + δr is

deﬁned to be δθ. The calculation goes as follows:

ˆe∗
2(r + δr) = ˆe2(r)

3.13 Comparison with Three-Vector Formula-

In order to compare our results with the three-vector formulation given by

Northrop [43], we must be able to cast our results into “1 + 3” notation.

We learned how to do this for the particle coordinates back at the end of

Section 3.4 where we gave the explicit transformation equations, Eqs. (3.357)

through (3.363). These are scalar equations in phase space, and so they will

retain their form under the guiding-center Lie transform. We need only to re-

place (k, β, w, θ) by (K,

, W, Θ), and to reinterpret βv as the guiding-center

B

three-velocity (divided by c). Then we can write down the equations of motion

for βv by diﬀerentiating Eqs. (3.357) through (3.359) with respect to proper

time, using the known equations of motion for the guiding-center coordinates,

and expressing the results back in terms of βv by using Eqs. (3.360) through

(3.363).

136

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

The above-described program seems rather tedious. Fortunately, there are

two things that we can do to simplify the task. First, we need only check our

results to the order of the classical drifts. This is the order given in the text by

Northrop [43]. Second, we can check our results in one of the “preferred” frames

of reference, as were described back in Section 3.4. If they hold there, they have

to hold in all other frames as well because our results are in manifestly covariant

format. These two simpliﬁcations make the problem straightforward.

First note that in a preferred frame βE = 0, so Eqs. (3.357) through (3.363)

become

is simply eB/mc. The classical curvature, gradient and polarization drifts are

readily visible in the above equation. If we had instead done the calculation for

gyromomentum µ is a constant of the motion. Note that Northrop’s magnetic

(K/4λB)F0 : (

ize to a preferred frame where the perpendicular electric ﬁeld vanishes (though

time-independent ﬁelds, spatially uniform magnetic ﬁeld, and zero parallel ve-

locity. These assumptions are not at all necessary; they serve only to simplify

an otherwise tedious calculation, to aid the reader in seeing an eﬀect that would

140

and

otherwise be masked by lots of other less interesting terms, and to facilitate

comparison with Appendix C. Under these circumstances, we ﬁnd that

Except for the factor γv, which is clearly a relativistic eﬀect, this is identical

to the gyrofrequency shift due to perpendicular electric ﬁelds that is derived

in Appendix C. This shift was discovered by Kaufman [47] in 1960, who also

showed that it gives rise to the phenomenon of gyroviscosity.

The reader is urged to consult the text by Northrop [43] as well as a paper

by Vandervoort [48] for a further discussion and alternative presentation of the

above results.

3.14 Manifestly Boostgauge and Gyrogauge In-

variant Format

The guiding-center equations of motion presented above contain expressions,
ˆt, that are not boostgauge or gyrogauge invariant. Of course, the

such as

→

∇

equations as a whole are guaranteed to be gauge invariant by our method of

derivation; but they are not manifestly so. This is due to the fact that our

chosen coordinates, namely (R, K,

, µ, Θ), are themselves not gauge invariant,

thanks to the inclusion of

and Θ. This observation suggests that if we were

B

B

to transform to a new set of gauge invariant coordinates, we could write our

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

141

results in manifestly gauge invariant format; that is, without any mention of the

unit vectors, ˆeα. In this section, we shall derive two new versions of the Poisson

brackets: The ﬁrst will be manifestly boostgauge invariant, but it will not be

manifestly gyrogauge invariant. The second will be both manifestly boostgauge

invariant and manifestly gyrogauge invariant.

3.14.1 Manifest Boostgauge Invariance

To get manifestly boostgauge invariant results, we would like to replace K and

by the new boostgauge invariant coordinate

B

(3.558)

(3.559)

(3.560)

The inverse transformation would then be

(cid:19)

−

(cid:18)

Alas, there is a problem with this approach. Since the new coordinate U is

a four vector, it contains four degrees of freedom, whereas K and

represent

B

only two degrees of freedom. This discrepency stems from the fact that U is not

an arbitrary four vector because it is constrained to lie in the parallel two ﬂat;

that is, it obeys the constraint equation

P⊥(R)

U = 0.

·

(3.561)

This constraint restricts U to two degrees of freedom, but it also means that

the coordinates R and U are no longer independent variables. The coordinate

transformation is not a diﬀeomorphism (it is injective rather than bijective) and

so we cannot proceed in the usual manner.

142

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

We can remedy this diﬃculty by temporarily relaxing the constraint in

Eq. (3.561). We make the following coordinate transformation (where, for clar-

ity, we use primes to distinguish the new coordinates):

U ′ = Kˆt(R,

) +

C1a
λB(R)

B

ˆc(R, Θ) + C1bˆa(R, Θ)

R′ = R

µ′ = µ

Θ′ = Θ.

The reason for including λB in the second term on the right hand side of the

equation for U ′ will become clear in the next subsection. The inverse transfor-

mation is then

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

C1a = λB(R′)U ′

ˆc(R′, Θ′)

·

C1b = U ′

ˆa(R′, Θ′).

·

Here, U ′ is no longer constrained to lie in the parallel two-ﬂat, and its perpendic-

ular components are called C1a/λB and C1b. In order to have the same number

of variables before and after the transformation, we have appended C1a and C1b

to our usual set of variables before making the transformation.

We now have a diﬀeomorphism, but we still have to decide how to deal with

these two new variables in the unprimed system. Our strategy will be to demand

that they are Casimir functions. That way, the dynamics is constrained to lie

Relativistic Guiding-Center Theory

143

on hypersurfaces for which they both are constant. If we start the phase space

trajectory on the hypersurface for which they are both zero, it will remain on

that hypersurface. Of course, the equations of motion that we end up with will

also be capable of describing dynamics on other hypersurfaces for which they

are nonzero, but we ignore these other orbits as physically irrelevent.

So our phase space coordinates before this transformation are now taken to

be (R, K,

, µ, Θ, C1a, C1b). The bracket relations among these coordinates are

B

given by Eqs. (3.497) through (3.504) for the brackets not involving C1a and

C1b. Then, following the strategy discussed in the last paragraph, we simply say

that the bracket of C1a or C1b with any of the other coordinates is zero. We now

have dynamics in a ten dimensional phase space, but we are interested in what

is going on only in the eight dimensional subspace deﬁned by C1a = C1b = 0.

We have simply imbedded the guiding-center dynamics in a higher dimensional

phase space. It is clear that the Poisson bracket still obeys antisymmetry and

the Jacobi identity.

It is now straightforward to write the Poisson bracket relations among the

new set of coordinates, (R′, U ′, µ′, Θ′). Once we are ﬁnished doing this, it will

be alright to set C1a and C1b equal to zero, but not until we have taken every

derivative that needs to be taken in the process; derivatives get messed up by

coordinate transformations that are not diﬀeomorphisms.

We illustrate this calculation for the

R′, U ′

bracket as follows:

or C1b have vanished, either because they are bracketed with something (recall

that they are Casimir functions), or because they appear in a term outside of

all derivatives and so we have set them to zero.

The action associated with this Lagrangian may be varied to yield the same

constraint, Eq. (3.561). Hence we have introduced the Lagrange multipliers, λ1a

to appear as a Casimir of the resulting Poisson structure; recall the example of

this phenomenon given in Subsection 2.3.6.

The equations of motion in this coordinate system are then easily found

either by using the Poisson brackets given in Eqs. (3.569) through (3.574) with

the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (3.581), or by ﬁnding the Euler-Lagrange equations

from the phase space Lagrangian given in Eq. (3.582). The results are

These equations of motion may be compared term for term with Eqs. (3.508)
through (3.511). In the equation for ˙R, note that the parallel motion is given

simply by U. The second term contains the grad-B drift, and the third term
contains the curvature and polarization drifts. The ﬁrst term of ˙U contains the

mirroring force, and the force due to the parallel electric ﬁeld arises from the

terms that contain F1 (via their dependence on F ′′′). Of course, ˙µ still vanishes,
and the equation for ˙Θ compares term for term with Eq. (3.511) in an obvious

way.

3.14.2 Manifest Boostgauge and Gyrogauge Invariance

well. To do this, we would like to replace the coordinate Θ by the new coordinate

Note that ˆα, like Θ, has nonvanishing brackets with R and U at higher order.

Once again, however, the set of functions of R and U form a subset of the set of

all possible phase functions that is closed under the operation of these Poisson

brackets; also, Hgc is independent of ˆα. So we can still reduce to the guiding-

center description.

Next, we note that these results could have been derived by varying the action

Chapter 4

Relativistic

Oscillation-Center Theory

4.1 Discussion

In this chapter, we shall consider the perturbation of a guiding center due to the

presence of an electromagnetic wave of eikonal form. In doing so, we shall take

as our unperturbed problem the guiding-center equations of motion, as derived

in Chapter 3. Thus we are eﬀectively using the superconvergent Lie transform

procedure as described in Subsection 2.4.1.

We are interested in understanding the response of the guiding center to the

presence of the wave. Towards this end, we seek a transformation to a new

system of coordinates in which the wave perturbation is removed. Neglecting

resonant phenomena, it turns out that it is possible to do this to ﬁrst order, but

not to second order. At second order, there remains an averaged residual pertur-

bation to the Hamiltonian that gives rise to the ponderomotive force exerted by

the wave on the guiding center. Thus, after we transform away the rapid ﬂuctu-

ations in the guiding-center motion, we are left with the slower ponderomotive

155

156

eﬀects.

Relativistic Oscillation-Center Theory

An analogy with the guiding-center problem may be helpful here. In that cal-

culation, we averaged over the rapid gyromotion to ﬁnd the slower drift motion.

The thing that is drifting is then called a “guiding center.” A guiding center

is a ﬁctitious object whose position and momentum are the gyroaverage of the

particle position and momentum, respectively. Furthermore, a guiding center

may be thought of as having an intrinsic or spin angular momentum equal to

the orbital angular momentum of the underlying gyrating particle. Thus, by

ﬁnding the averaging transformation that eliminates the fast degree of freedom,

we have discovered a new “macroparticle” that lives on the slow time scale, but

whose properties derive from those of the original charged particle gyrating on

the fast time scale.

Similarly, when a perturbing wave is present and we transform away the as-

sociated rapid ﬂuctuations, the residual ponderomotive forces may be thought

of as acting on a new “macroparticle” that is averaged over a wave oscillation

time scale. We call this new object an “oscillation center.” Whereas an individ-

ual charged particle feels wave ﬂuctuations on a rapid time scale, an oscillation

center feels only the slower ponderomotive eﬀects; it also feels resonant eﬀects

(since these are also slow and do not average away), but we shall ignore these

in our treatment. Thus, a kinetic equation for a plasma of oscillation centers

would contain only ponderomotive forces and resonant eﬀects.

The averaged nth-order part of the ponderomotive Hamiltonian is called Kn,

and we shall derive this for a relativistic guiding center. As has already been

noted, K1 vanishes if we neglect resonant eﬀects. It was discovered by Cary and

Kaufman that there exists an intimate connection between the ponderomotive

Hamiltonian and the plasma’s response to a wave. Speciﬁcally, K2 is a quadratic

form in the amplitude of the perturbing wave, and the kernel of this quadratic

form is the functional derivative of the linear susceptibility with respect to the

Relativistic Oscillation-Center Theory

157

distribution function. Subsequently, it was found by Kaufman that this relation-

ship persists to higher order; that is, nonlinear corrections to the susceptibility

are related to K3, etc.

In the traditional approach to studying plasma response to a wave, one be-

gins with the ﬁeld equations and the kinetic equation, and studies perturbations

in the ﬁelds and the distribution function about an equilibrium. Though this

approach is not as systematic as ours, it has at least one advantage: The vector

potential never appears, so all results obtained by such an analysis are guaran-

teed to be manifestly gauge invariant. In contrast, Hamiltonian or Lagrangian

approaches to ponderomotive theory seem to require the use of the vector po-

tential, so past attempts along these lines have produced results whose gauge

invariance was either not established, or established only by laborious calculation

after the fact.

In this chapter, we shall ﬁnd that eikonal wave perturbations to the La-

grangian action for a relativistic charged particle in the guiding-center repre-

sentation can be written in manifestly gauge-invariant form. To do this, it is

necessary to abandon the usual approach of expanding the eikonal wave per-

turbation in a series of Bessel functions of k⊥ρ. Instead, we ﬁrst perform a

Lagrangian gauge transformation, and then we expand in a series of functions

that are related to indeﬁnite integrals of Bessel functions. This allows us to de-

velop an oscillation-center theory to arbitrarily high order in the wave amplitude

expansion parameter, and be guaranteed of manifest gauge invariance at every

step of the way. Thus, we can enjoy the beneﬁts of the systematic Lie trans-

form approach to ponderomotive theory without fear of losing manifest gauge

invariance.

4.2 Eikonal Wave Perturbation

In single-particle phase space coordinates, an eikonal wave has a four potential

of the form

Aw(r) = ˜A(r) exp

ψ(r)

+ c.c.,

(4.618)

i
ǫ

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where ˜A is the amplitude and ψ is the phase, and where c.c. denotes the expres-

sion’s complex conjugate. The derivative of ψ with respect to spacetime position

is the four wavevector, k:

∇
Both ˜A and k are slowly varying functions of r. That is, an eikonal wave is locally

→

k =

ψ(r).

(4.619)

a plane wave. To reﬂect this, we have placed 1/ǫ in front of the phase. Thus,

the derivative of Aw with respect to r is ikAw/ǫ plus terms of order unity that
involve derivatives of ˜A or of k.

Furthermore, in this work, we shall take this eikonal expansion parameter to

be equal to the guiding-center expansion parameter (hence, it is no coincidence

that we are calling it ǫ). This means that we are considering waves whose char-

acteristic wavelengths are on the order of a gyroradius, and whose characteristic

frequencies are on the order of a gyrofrequency.

We shall now consider the eﬀect of such a wave on the single particle action

one form in Eq. (3.370). Replacing A in that equation by A + λAw, we write

γ = γ′′ + λγw,

(4.620)

where γw is the perturbation in the action one form due to the wave, or

γw =

˜A(r)

·

e
c

i
ǫ

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

+ c.c.

(4.621)

Note that we have introduced a new expansion parameter, λ, to order the wave

amplitude. For the time being, we shall not compare λ and ǫ, though more will

be said about this later.

Relativistic Oscillation-Center Theory

159

As was remarked earlier, our starting point for the oscillation center Lie

transform will be the guiding-center equations of motion. Hence, it is necessary

to write γw in guiding-center coordinates (the above form for γw is in particle

coordinates). We apply the guiding-center Lie transform to the above equation

for γ to get

Γw is given by

Γ = Γgc + λΓw,

(4.622)

where Γgc is the guiding-center action one form, calculated in Chapter 3. Then,

Γw = exp(

Lg)γw,
ǫ
−

(4.623)

where g is the generator for the guiding-center transformation.

Note that we are working only to ﬁrst order in ǫ. To this order we can take

gr =

ρˆa, where ρ

−

≡

w/ΩB. All other components of g are unnecessary, and may

be ignored. We shall use the boostgauge invariant set of coordinates (R, U, µ, θ)

described in Section 3.14.

4.3 Manifest Gauge Invariance

At this point in the calculation, the usual approach is to apply the Lie transform

in Eq. (4.623) by simply substituting R + ρˆa for r in Eq. (4.621). This is

straightforward, and the result is

Γw =

where we have retained the leading nonvanishing order for each component of

the one form, and where it is understood that all quantities on the right (such as
˜A and ˆc) are now evaluated at R. Since ˆa

k is oscillatory, the second exponential

·

in the above expression gives rise to a series of Bessel functions of k⊥ρ.

Unfortunately, the above expression for Γw does not possess manifest gauge

invariance. To understand why this is, we must qualify what we mean by “man-

160

Relativistic Oscillation-Center Theory

ifest gauge invariance.” A term in the action one form is gauge invariant if it is
unchanged to within a Lagrangian gauge transformation when ˜A is replaced by
˜A + ikΛ, where Λ is any slowly varying scalar function of position. Thus, the

quantity

·

˜F

i(k ˜A

≡

(4.625)

is gauge invariant since it is unchanged by this transformation. The quantity
˜A

dR exp(iψ/ǫ) is also gauge invariant since it transforms to itself plus the term

Lagrangian gauge transformation. We shall say that a term is manifestly gauge
invariant if it has the form ˜A
dR exp(iψ/ǫ), or if it depends on ˜A only through
its dependence on ˜F .

·

Thus the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of Eq. (4.624) is manifestly gauge

invariant, but the other two terms are not. They are gauge invariant (as they

must be), since to leading order in ǫ we have

and this can be removed by a Lagrangian gauge transformation, but they are

not manifestly gauge invariant.

If we were to use Eq. (4.624) as the starting point for our ponderomotive

theory, we would obtain results for Kn that are not manifestly gauge invari-

ant. We could get around this problem if there were some way of manipulating

Eq. (4.624) into manifestly gauge-invariant form. It turns out that this can be

done by making a particular Lagrangian gauge transformation, but this trans-

formation is far from obvious and needs to be motivated. As we shall now see,

this motivation comes from the homotopy formula.

Note that the second term in square brackets is an exact one form, and may

therefore be removed by a Lagrangian gauge transformation. The ﬁrst term in

square brackets has two pieces: The ﬁrst is γw itself, which we know is manifestly

gauge invariant. The second is a series of terms all of which have the operator

igd, raised to some power, operating on γw. Thus, in all these terms, the very

ﬁrst operator to be applied to γw is the exterior derivative. Now

dγw =

˜F : dr

i
ǫ

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

dr exp

ψ(r)

+ c.c.

(4.631)

(plus higher-order terms), and this is manifestly gauge invariant. Subsequent

applications of ig and d preserve this manifest gauge invariance. Thus the term

in the ﬁrst square brackets on the right hand side of Eq. (4.630) is manifestly

gauge invariant. Thus, Eq. (4.630) gives us the Lagrangian gauge transformation

that leaves Γw in manifestly gauge invariant form.

At this point, one may wonder why we have bothered to keep all the terms

in the above series when we have said that we are interested in only the lowest

nonvanishing order in ǫ. Note that when we apply diﬀerential operators to γw, as

given by Eq. (4.621), we pull out factors of 1/ǫ. This means that even terms with

162

Relativistic Oscillation-Center Theory

very high j can make order unity contributions. Thus, it is important to keep

all the terms of the series as given above. This situation arises as a consequence

of the nonanalyticity of γw in ǫ. It will become more clear momentarily.
To proceed, we need expressions for (igd)jγw and ig(dig)jγw, for j

1. To

get such expressions, we simply evaluate them for the ﬁrst few values of j, notice

the pattern, and prove it by mathematical induction. The results are

erything is going as planned.

4.5 The Oscillation-Center Lie Transform

Our aim is to perform a Lie transform that will remove all the eﬀects of the wave

from the Poisson structure, and put them into the Hamiltonian. Thus, when we

have completed this task, our Poisson brackets will be identical to those for a

guiding center with no wave present (through order λ2). The eﬀect of the wave

will be pushed into a term of order λ2 in the Hamiltonian. We shall do this both

for Γw and for Γ′

w, in order to verify that we get the same answer either way.
We now reset our variables, so that Γw (as given by Eq. (4.648)) and Γ′
w

(as given by Eq. (4.654)) will henceforth be called γw and γ′

w, respectively. The

168

Relativistic Oscillation-Center Theory

oscillation-center transform will take us to Γw and Γ′

w, but we want these to

vanish by the above argument. Thus, in Eqs. (2.273) and (2.274) we demand that

Γ1 and Γ2 vanish. This is the step at which we are neglecting resonant eﬀects.

Furthermore, in Eq. (2.274) we have γ2 = 0 because our wave perturbation is at

ﬁrst order in λ only, and Ω1 = 0 because Γ1 = 0.

First consider the oscillation-center transform of γw. We have

Meanwhile, the Hamiltonian transforms according to Eqs. (2.221) through

Now we can choose S2 to remove the oscillatory part of the ﬁrst term. Note

that we cannot remove the averaged part of the ﬁrst term, because that would

introduce secular terms in S2. So the best that we can do is to take

This is the ponderomotive Hamiltonian.

Now suppose that we had started with γ′

w = γw + dST instead of γw. Instead

of Eqs. (4.660) and (4.661), we would have written

convention of using primes to denote quantities arising from the Lagrangian

gauge transformed action one form. Of course, we still would have taken K ′

so the ponderomotive Hamiltonian is indeed invariant under the Lagrangian

gauge transformation. Note that g1, g2, and S2 are also thus invariant, but that

γw and S1 are not. The latter two quantities transform under the Lagrangian

gauge transformation as follows:

so that the combination γw + dS1 is invariant.

(4.682)

Though we have just shown that we would get the same answer for the

ponderomotive Hamiltonian either way, it bears repeating that the advantage of

starting with γ′

1 is its manifest gauge invariance. In the next section, we shall

further discuss the relative merits of each of the two ways of calculating K2.

While the above expression, Eq. (4.669), for the ponderomotive Hamiltonian

is wonderfully compact, it is also very formal. We need to plug in Eq. (4.648)

and/or Eq. (4.654), and work it out in detail. This is done in the next section.

Before using the above results to calculate K2, we digress for one last discus-

sion about the relative merits of starting with γw and γ′

w. First note that all of

the components of g1 and ωw are indeed manifestly gauge invariant. If we had

started the calculation with γ′

w, this would not be a surprise since γ′

w is itself

Relativistic Oscillation-Center Theory

175

manifestly gauge invariant; if however we had started the calculation with γw,

the manifest gauge invariance of the result would seem fortuitous. In the latter
event, we would have had results in terms of ˜A, and only through some tedious
algebraic manipulations would we have discovered that their dependence on ˜A
arose only through a dependence on ˜F . On the other hand, note that the only

special functions that appear in the components of g1 and ωw are the Bessel

functions, Jℓ. The Qℓ and Rℓ functions have all disappeared in favor of the Jℓ.

If we had started the calculation with γw, this would not be a surprise since

γw itself depends only on the Jℓ, and not on the Qℓ and Rℓ; if however we had

started the calculation with γ′

w, the disappearance of the Qℓ and Rℓ functions

would seem fortuitous. In the latter event, we would have had results in terms of

the Qℓ and Rℓ functions, and only through some tedious algebraic manipulations

would we have discovered that the recursion relations and derivative formulas

could be used to cast them in terms of Jℓ alone. There is thus a peculiar duality

between the presence of special functions and of manifest gauge invariance.

We now insert the above formulas into our expression for K2. The averaging

is carried out as follows:

K ′

are useful. Henceforth we shall drop the prime in our notation, and refer to

the ponderomotive Hamiltonian only as K2, whether or not it is in manifestly

gauge-invariant form.

Note that K2 is a function of the phase space coordinates, R, U, µ and θ; in

particular, it depends on R through its dependence on the background ﬁelds,

F0(R) and F1(R), and through its dependence on the eikonal wave ﬁeld param-
eters, ˜F (R) and k(R). Thus we write K2(Z; Fi(R), ˜F (R), k(R)), where i = 0, 1.

The ponderomotive Hamiltonian will be used extensively in the next chap-

ter where we shall study the self-consistent dynamics of magnetized relativistic

plasma in an eikonal wave ﬁeld.

4.7 Obtaining the Ponderomotive Hamiltonian

Using Canonical Lie Transforms

Grebogi and Littlejohn [8] have obtained the ponderomotive Hamiltonian by

ﬁrst performing a single noncanonical coordinate transformation to remove the

perturbation from the action one form, and then using canonical Lie transforms

on the Hamiltonian. We shall use that procedure in this section in order to check

our above result for K2.

Let us return to the point at which the wave perturbation was ﬁrst added

to the single-particle action one form in Eq. (4.620). Recall the deﬁnition of the

single-particle velocity u in Eq. (3.366). Suppose that we change this deﬁnition

to absorb the wave perturbation; that is, we adopt the following new deﬁnition

for u:

u =

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

A(q)

+

˜A(q) exp

ψ (q)

+ c.c.

(4.721)

This has the eﬀect of returning the action one form to the functional form that it

had before the wave was introduced. Of course, the deﬁnitions of the quantities

that appear in the one form will be diﬀerent; that is, u and anything that depends

on u (e.g. k, β, w, and θ) will be deﬁned diﬀerently in terms of the single-particle

position and velocity. Nevertheless, the action one form is returned to the form

that it had when no wave was present, and now we can apply the usual guiding-

center transformation to take it to the guiding-center action one form Γw, given

implicitly in Eq. (3.582), with no remaining perturbation due to the wave.

Whereas the action one form has thus been simpliﬁed by this transforma-

tion, the Hamiltonian, Eq. (3.367), now becomes considerably more complicated.

Using the new deﬁnition of u in Eq. (3.364), we have

H ′(r, u) = H ′

0(r, u) + λH ′

1(r, u) + λ2H ′

(4.729)

To recap, we have applied a noncanonical transformation to remove the per-

turbation from the Poisson structure and deposit it in the Hamiltonian. We

can now use a canonical Lie transform to remove H1 (neglecting resonances)

and average H2 to get K2. Note that this method does not preserve manifest

gauge invariance; that was lost in the very ﬁrst step when we redeﬁned u in a

gauge-dependent way.

That this answer is equal to our previous result for K2 may be proved by ex-

and using the sum rules of Appendix E to sum the terms with no resonant

denominator. The result is Eqs. (4.717) and (4.718).

Note that this is by far the easiest way to get K2. Furthermore, it yields the

result in a considerably more compact form than the Lagrangian Lie transform

approach does. On the other hand, as has already been noted, it does not yield

the result in manifestly gauge invariant form.

180

Relativistic Oscillation-Center Theory

This result may be compared with that of Grebogi and Littlejohn [8] who

used “1 + 3” notation and whose result was gauge invariant but not manifestly

so. To make this comparison, use the technique for translating our results into

“1 + 3” notation that was introduced back in Section 3.13. It is then a straight-

forward exercise to show that our ponderomotive Hamiltonian gives rise to the

same equations of motion as that of Littlejohn and Grebogi, though the two are

not numerically equal. The reason that the two results for K2 are not numer-

ically equal can be traced back to the fact that the corresponding unperturbed

Hamiltonians are not numerically equal. This is because Littlejohn and Grebogi

started with the Hamiltonian (written in terms of three-vector coordinates and

velocities),

HLG = (γv −

1)mc2 + eφ,

(4.736)

which is not numerically equal to the Hamiltonian that we started with, though

it does yield the same equations of motion.

It is easier to compare our result with that of Achterberg [49] who used a

four-vector approach, but who did not worry about manifest gauge invariance

and who used essentially the same method outlined in this section. His result is

identical to our Eq. (4.735), outside of some minor notational diﬀerences.

The Relativistic

Guiding-Center Plasma

5.1 Discussion

The reason that a Vlasov plasma is a nonlinear medium is that the plasma

currents generate ﬁelds which in turn drive the motion of the plasma. Up until

now in this thesis, we have dealt only with single particles (or single guiding

centers or single guiding/oscillation centers) moving in ﬁelds that are known in

advance as ﬁxed functions of spacetime. In this ﬁnal chapter, we show how to

pass from this single particle description to a self-consistent description of the

dynamics of the guiding-center plasma; this includes the dynamics of the ﬁelds

as well as that of the particles. We shall do this by imbedding the single particle

action in a system action, and coupling it to the Maxwell ﬁeld.

In Section 5.2, we prove Liouville’s theorem, and show how to write the

Vlasov equation in any desired coordinate system. In Section 5.3, we sum the

guiding-center Lagrangian action over a full distribution of guiding centers and

couple to the Maxwell ﬁeld in order to obtain the Lagrangian action of the full

181

182

The Relativistic Guiding-Center Plasma

guiding-center Vlasov plasma. The variation of this with respect to the guiding-

center coordinates yields the relativistic kinetic equation for guiding centers,

while the variation with respect to the four potential yields the self-consistent

ﬁeld equation including the guiding-center magnetization and current densities.

In Section 5.4, Noether’s theorem is applied constructively to obtain covari-

ant conservation laws for the momentum-energy and the angular momentum of

a guiding-center plasma. That is, we obtain the stress-energy and angular mo-

mentum tensors of the guiding-center plasma, including the contribution to the

angular momentum due to guiding-center spin.

Finally, in Section 5.5, we employ the results of Chapter 4 to generalize

the results of Sections 5.3 and 5.4 to the case of a guiding-center plasma in an

eikonal wave ﬁeld. We begin by forming a system action, this time including the

Maxwell action of the eikonal wave ﬁeld, and the ponderomotive Hamiltonian of

the guiding/oscillation centers. Variation with respect to the coordinates again

yields the kinetic equation, which now includes a term due to the ponderomotive

eﬀects caused by the wave ﬁeld. Variation with respect to the four potential of

the background ﬁeld again yields the self-consistent ﬁeld equation, which now

includes a modiﬁcation in the magnetization density due to the presence of the

wave. There are then two new additional variations: Variation with respect to

the eikonal wave ﬁeld amplitude yields the linear dispersion relation for the wave,

and variation with respect to the eikonal wave phase yields the conservation law

for wave action. Constructive application of Noether’s theorem to this new

system action yields the laws of conservation of energy-momentum and angular

momentum for the combined system of plasma, background ﬁeld, and wave

ﬁeld. Speciﬁcally, the modiﬁcation to the stress-energy and angular momentum

tensors due to the presence of the wave ﬁeld is presented and discussed.

5.2 Liouville’s Theorem

5.2.1 Lagrangian and Eulerian Descriptions of Relativistic

Plasma

In this section, we present a version of Liouville’s theorem that is valid for

relativistic Hamiltonian systems with noncanonical coordinates. We begin by

examining the diﬀerence between the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of

relativistic kinetic theory.

Recall that a Lagrangian description keeps track of the trajectory of each

particle of the system, whereas an Eulerian description uses a distribution func-

tion to specify the phase-space density of particles (we discussed this brieﬂy in

Section 2.3.3). Thus, a Lagrangian description for a system of relativistic parti-

cles might be the speciﬁcation of z(η, τ ), where z denotes a set of n-dimensional

phase space coordinates, η is a continuous particle label, and τ (η) is an orbit

parameter along the world line of the particle with label η. Specifying z as a

function of η and τ is equivalent to specifying the phase space orbit of every

particle in the system. The corresponding Eulerian distribution is

fn(Z) =

dN (η)

dτ (η)δn

Z

z(η, τ )

.

(5.737)

Z

Z

−

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Here dN (η) is some measure describing the number of particles with labels be-

tween η and η + dη. This measure appears when we pass from the discrete to

the continuum description; that is

dN (η).

(5.738)

→

Z

Xparticles

In what follows, we shall frequently not bother to write the explicit η dependence

of τ, but it should be kept in mind that each particle has its own proper time.

Note that f (Z) has support only on a space of dimension smaller than that

of the full n-dimensional phase space. This is because there are constraints

that must be satisﬁed by the various coordinates involved. For example, single-

particle dynamics must remain on the mass shell, since u

u =

c2. Upon

·

−

184

The Relativistic Guiding-Center Plasma

making the guiding-center transformation, this requirement is easily seen to

become Hgc =

mc2/2 (the guiding-center transformation is a diﬀeomorphism,

so the mass shell is distorted but not topologically altered). So, when using the

(R, K,

, µ, Θ) coordinates, f has support on a seven dimensional submanifold in

−

B

an eight dimensional phase space. When we use the (R, U, µ, Θ) coordinates the

phase space is ten dimensional, and when we use the (R, U, µ, ˆα) coordinates the

phase space is thirteen dimensional; in all cases, however, f has support only on

a manifold of seven dimensions thanks to the constraints on these coordinates.

The Lagrangian description keeps track of the dynamics of all the particles in

the system as though they were distinguishable, and so it includes more degrees

of freedom than the Eulerian description. That is why it is possible to write the

Eulerian distribution f (Z) in terms of the Lagrangian description z(η, τ ), but

it is impossible to do the reverse. There are many diﬀerent functional forms for

z(η, τ ) that yield the same f (Z). Nevertheless, for a plasma of indistinguishable

particles (we are not going to bother about species labelling in this thesis) it

is clear that any physically relevant quantity can be expressed in terms of the

Eulerian distribution, f (Z). This is because any physically relevant quantity

should not depend on the identity of the individual particles in the system.

This is really a gauge invariance issue. The gauge group is the group of

identical particle interchanges. The Lagrangian description keeps track of extra

nonphysical gauge degrees of freedom. A physically relevant quantity can be

written in terms of the Eulerian distribution since it is gauge invariant in this

regard.

Consider for example the value of some phase function, Φ(z), summed over

all the particles in the system and integrated along world lines

NΦ =

dN (η)

Though we shall frequently work with the Lagrangian description of things, we

must be able to show that our results can be expressed in terms of the Eulerian

distribution. Fortunately, this will pose no problem.

The Lagrangian description of the dynamics of the system is then given by

˙z(η, τ ) = V

,

(5.741)

(cid:0)
where the dot denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to τ , and where V is the

dynamical vector ﬁeld expressed as a function of z(η, τ ) and as a functional of z

(since the dynamics of one particle may depend on the phase space positions of

all the other particles in the system). The corresponding Eulerian description

of the dynamics is then found as follows:

(5.742)

186

The Relativistic Guiding-Center Plasma

had to assume that the functional dependence of V on z could be replaced by a

functional dependence on fn; this is just a statement of the very reasonable con-

dition that the dynamics cannot depend on particle labels. The resulting kinetic

equation for fn(Z) is called the continuity equation, and it expresses conserva-

tion of particles. It is true for any relativistic system of particles, regardless of

the nature of the forces involved (they could even be dissipative in nature).

5.2.2 Conservation of Phase Space Volume

One thing that distinguishes Hamiltonian systems from other dynamical systems

is the property that phase space volume is conserved by a Hamiltonian ﬂow.

This means that if we take a volume element in phase space and drag each point

of its boundary surface along a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld for some parameter

increment, the volume enclosed will be unchanged. As we shall now see, this

property follows from the Jacobi identity; this fact was used in Section 3.10 as an

argument for using brackets that satisfy the Jacobi identity exactly (as opposed

to satisfying it only to some order in an expansion parameter).

Suppose that we have a set of canonical coordinates Zc, and that the Eule-

rian distribution function in these coordinates is fc(Zc). Now under a (possibly
noncanonical) coordinate transformation, Zc 7→
forms in such a way as to keep the number of particles in a ﬁxed phase space

Z, a distribution function trans-

volume element constant. That is

f (Z)dnZ = fc(Zc)dnZc,

(5.743)

where n is the number of dimensions in phase space. Thus, f transforms like a

pseudoscalar,

f (Z) = fc(Zc)D,

(5.744)

where we have deﬁned the Jacobian of the transformation

D(Z) =

∂nZc
∂nZ

.

(5.745)

The Relativistic Guiding-Center Plasma

187

Alternatively, we can deﬁne a scalar distribution function, f(Z), which trans-

forms as follows:

It follows that in any coordinate system we have

f(Z) = fc(Zc).

f (Z) = f(Z)D(Z).

(5.746)

(5.747)

Note that f (Z) = f(Z) in any canonical coordinate system, since the Jacobian

of a canonical transformation is unity. In noncanonical coordinates, however,
f (Z) and f(Z) are diﬀerent.

The Lagrangian two-form in coordinate system Z is given by

Ωµν =

∂Zα
c
∂Zµ

∂Zβ
c
∂Zν Ωc

αβ,

(5.748)

where Ωc is the canonical Lagrangian two-form. Taking the determinant of both

sides, we ﬁnd

detΩ = D2.

(5.749)

We now no longer need to make reference to the canonical coordinate system,

Zc. Eqs. (5.747) and (5.749) tell us all we need to know, and they are written

entirely in the general coordinates, Z.

Take the gradient of both sides of Eq. (5.749) to get

2DD,α = (detΩ),α

= D2J βγΩγβ,α,

(5.750)

where we used the formula for the derivative of a determinant,

(detA),α = (detA)(A−1)βγAγβ,α.

(5.751)

We are now ready to prove Liouville’s theorem. We have

D( ˙ZαD),α = D(J αβH,βD),α

Applying Liouville’s theorem, we get the Vlasov equation,

Our proof of this result has been quite general, and so in the future we can simply

write down the Vlasov equation for any Hamiltonian equations of motion.

The careful reader will have noticed that we assumed invertibility of

the Poisson tensor in the above proof, whereas our Poisson tensors in the

(R, U, µ, Θ) and (R, U, µ, ˆα) coordinate systems are deﬁnitely singular. Re-

call, however, that we showed in Section 3.14 how these constrained coordi-

nate systems could be imbedded in larger unconstrained coordinate systems.

That is, we can obtain the (R, U, µ, Θ) coordinates by a smooth coordinate

transformation from the (R, K,

, µ, Θ, C1a, C1b) coordinates, and we can ob-

B

tain the (R, U, µ, ˆα) coordinates by a smooth coordinate transformation from

the (R, K,

, µ, Θ, C1a, C1b, C2a, C2b, C3) coordinates. In both cases, the physi-

B

cal motion takes place on the subspace for which C1a = C1b = C2a = C2b = 0

The Relativistic Guiding-Center Plasma

189

and C3 = 1; if the initial conditions are on this subspace, the dynamics will

keep them there. From this point of view, there is nothing singular about the

transformation that led to these coordinate systems, and the only reason that

their Poisson tensors are singular is that we enforced the constraints by setting

C1a = C1b = C2a = C2b = 0 and C3 = 1 at the very end of the calculation that

led to them.

Armed with this insight, it is easy to compute the Jacobian D for these

coordinate systems. First we consider the guiding-center transformation that

led to the (R, K,

, µ, Θ) coordinates from canonical coordinates. The Jacobian

of this transformation is

B

where Ωgc is the Lagrangian two-form given in Eqs. (3.490) through (3.494).

(5.756)

The result is

KΩBΥ.

m3

(5.757)

The coordinates (C1a, C1b, C2a, C2b, C3), which can be thought of as describing

directions transverse to those described by the (R, K,

, µ, Θ) coordinates, are

B

unaﬀected by the above transformation.

We now transform to either the (R, U, µ, Θ) system or the (R, U, µ, ˆα) sys-

tem. This transformation will involve the coordinates (C1a, C1b, C2a, C2b, C3).

Its Jacobian is given by

D2 =

∂(R, U, µ, Θ)

∂(R, K,

, µ, Θ, C1a, C1b)

B

(5.758)

or

D2 =

, µ, Θ, C1a, C1b, C2a, C2b, C3)

B

∂(R, U, µ, ˆα)

,

(5.759)

respectively. We can use the transformation equations, Eqs. (3.562) or (3.591),

to calculate the above expressions. The important thing is that we take all of

the derivatives involved in calculating the Jacobian before enforcing the con-

straints by setting C1a = C1b = C2a = C2b = 0 and C3 = 1. The calculation is

190

straightforward, and we ﬁnd that for either the (R, U, µ, Θ) or the (R, U, µ, ˆα)

coordinates we get

D2 =

1
2Kλ2
B

.

The overall Jacobian of the above transformation is thus

D = D1D2 =

em2
2ǫcλB(R)

Υ′(R),

(5.760)

(5.761)

where Υ′ is given by Eq. (3.575). Note that this same expression may be used for

the guiding/oscillation-center problem, since it has exactly the same brackets as

the guiding-center problem with no wave present. This is because our oscillation-

center Lie transform took the wave perturbation out of the brackets and put it

into the Hamiltonian (which is how we got K2).

Thus by imbedding our singular coordinate systems in larger nonsingu-

lar ones, we are able to validate the above derivation of the Vlasov equa-

tion for our coordinates.

Because we had to introduce the coordinates

(C1a, C1b, C2a, C2b, C3), however, we should ask what the distribution func-

tion looks like, and whether or not the kinetic equation that we have started

with makes sense. Consider Eq. (5.737), written for the coordinate system

Z = (R, K,

, µ, Θ, C1a, C1b, C2a, C2b, C3). We adopt the shorthand notation

Z = (Y, C) where Y = (R, K,

, µ, Θ) and C = (C1a, C1b, C2a, C2b, C3). Then

where y(η, τ ) and c(η, τ ) give the dynamics of Y and C, respectively. Note,

however, that since the integral,

constraints C1a = C1b = C2a = C2b = 0 and C3 = 1, and since the dynam-

R

ics is known to keep such particles on the constraint surface, it must be that

c(η, τ ) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1). Thus the delta functions involving C can be pulled out of

The proportionality of f13 to delta functions in the C is simply a mathematical

restatement of our earlier observation that it has support only on a space of

dimension less than that coordinatized by Z. In fact, it has support only on

a space of seven dimensions (there is another delta function still hiding in the

integral on the right hand side of the above equation due to the fact that the

Hamiltonian is a constant of the motion). The Vlasov equation written in these

coordinates is then

∂f13
∂Y
where f13 = f13/D1 and where the terms ˙C
∂f13/∂C are not present because
˙C = 0. We can now integrate the above Vlasov equation over the C coordinates

coordinates from the start.

It turns out to be easier (for reasons that will become clear shortly) to write
the Vlasov equation in terms of f and easier to write the ﬁeld equation in terms

of f. Since we know what D is, however, there is clearly no problem involved in
writing both equations in terms of either f or f (recall that f and f are related

by Eq. (5.747) with D given by Eq. (5.761)).

5.3 Self-Consistent Kinetic and Field Equations

5.3.1 Constructing the System Action

We begin by considering the case in which there is no eikonal wave ﬁeld present.

Our action one-form and Hamiltonian for a single guiding-center are thus given

by Eqs. (3.604) and (3.581), respectively.

In Section 5.5, we generalize our

results to the case in which the plasma is bathed in an eikonal wave ﬁeld. For

now we construct the action for the coupled system of guiding-center plasma

and Maxwell ﬁeld. This has the form

S = Sgc + Sm,

(5.767)

where Sgc is the total action of the guiding centers, and where Sm is the action

of the Maxwell ﬁeld.

Now the action of the guiding centers is found by simply summing that for

a single guiding center over the full distribution. Thus we write

Sgc[Z, Ai] =

Here we have written Z for the full set of boostgauge and gyrogauge invariant

guiding-center coordinates, (R, U, µ, ˆα). We have enforced the constraints by

means of Lagrange multipliers, using λν to denote the multiplier for constraint

Cν, where the index ν runs over all the constraints present as usual. Finally, we

have indicated separately the functional dependence of the various terms on the

four potential Ai and the background ﬁeld Fi (here i denotes the ordering of the

ﬁeld as discussed in Section 3.7).

5.3.3 The Field Equations

Generally speaking, the idea is now to vary the above action with respect to the

four potential to get the dynamical equations for the ﬁelds. This must be done

carefully, however, as there are two additional constraints that such variation

must respect. Recall that in our derivation of the guiding-center action we

assumed that the background ﬁeld scale lengths were large in comparison to

The Relativistic Guiding-Center Plasma

195

the gyroradius, and we assumed that the zero-order ﬁelds have λE = 0. We

must make certain that the dynamics of the ﬁelds do not evolve them into a

conﬁguration for which either of these assumptions are violated. In order to get

dynamical equations for the ﬁelds that respect these constraints, our variation

of the action with respect to the four potential must be a constrained variation;

that is, arbitrary variations of the four potential are not allowed. Only those

variations of the four potential that preserve the vanishing of λE to lowest order

and the smallness of the ratio of gyroradius to scale length are allowed.

We thus begin our derivation of the ﬁeld equations by examining the variation

of the action due to variations of the Ai, without assuming in any way that the

variations of the Ai are arbitrary. Recall that we have indicated separately the

functional dependence of the various terms in the action on the four potential

Ai and the background ﬁeld Fi. Of course, Fi = dAi, so when we vary with

respect to the Ai we must take into account the Fi dependence. To do this, it

is convenient to distinguish between total and partial functional derivatives with

respect to Ai. We use the chain rule to write

Note that the magnetization came from the second term on the right of

Eq. (5.783). Also note that the only thing that depends explicitly on F1 is

the ﬁrst-order piece of the Hamiltonian, so that only the last term in square

brackets in the above expression for M1 survives; of course, F1 also appears in

the brackets due to the A1 dependence of Γgc. Finally note that we were able

to write the current and the magnetizations in terms of the reduced Eulerian
distribution function, f9.

Now because the δAi are not arbitrary, we cannot simply set

J1 = 0.
Instead, as discussed above, we must restrict the variation so that it respects

J0 =

the constraints that λE = 0 to lowest order and that the ratio of gyroradius

to scale length is small. To deal with the ﬁrst of these constraints, let us tem-

porarily introduce Clebsch variables for the ﬁelds. We deﬁne four scalar ﬁelds,

α(x), β(x), κ(x), σ(x), such that in terms of these ﬁelds the four potential is given

That such scalar ﬁelds exist is guaranteed by the Darboux theorem. That is,

We still cannot set the coeﬃcients of the variations equal to zero, however,

The Relativistic Guiding-Center Plasma

varying for the guiding-center approximation to remain valid. This point requires

some discussion.

Consider a general Fourier decomposition of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in and

around a plasma. We can divide the Fourier space into three regions. The ﬁrst

consists of slowly varying ﬁelds for which the guiding-center approximation is

clearly valid; we call these background ﬁelds. The second consists of rapidly

varying ﬁelds that are due to collective motion of the plasma; we call these wave

ﬁelds, and their eﬀect on a single guiding center was the subject of Chapter 4.

Note that wave ﬁelds violate the guiding-center approximation, and the only

reason that we were able to treat them perturbatively was our assumption that

their amplitudes are small. The third consists of the extremely rapid ﬂuctuations

associated with collisions and higher correlations.

Now ﬁelds belonging to the third region of Fourier space are clearly outside

of the scope of this thesis; our Vlasov kinetic description of the plasma neglects

correlations. Wave ﬁelds were studied in a single particle context in Chapter 4,

and their self-consistent evolution will be studied in Section 5.5. For now we are

interested in the dynamics of the background ﬁelds. We thus deﬁne a projection

operator,

, that, when applied to an arbitrary ﬁeld, projects out the part that is

P

slowly varying. We shall not be speciﬁc about the nature of this operator except

to say that, since it is a projection operator, we expect it to be idempotent. A

moment’s thought convinces one that this means that it must be a convolution

of the ﬁeld with a ﬁlter function whose Fourier transform is piecewise constant,

having a value of either zero or one everywhere in Fourier space. Speciﬁcally,

it has a value of one in the ﬁrst of the above-described three regions of Fourier

space, and a value of zero in the other two regions. Exactly how one draws these

boundaries is what we are leaving unspeciﬁed.

Thus, although we cannot set the coeﬃcients of δα(x), δβ(x), δκ(x), and

δσ(x) equal to zero in Eq. (5.797), we can enforce the constraint that the ﬁelds

200

are slowly varying by requiring that their variations be slowly varying; thus

δα(x) =

δα(x)

P

(5.798)

(and similarly for the other three variations). We can also decompose the coef-

ﬁcients of the variations into slowly varying and rapidly varying parts; thus

β, we get the product of the slowly varying terms and a cross term.

Now the cross term is clearly oscillatory and vanishes upon integration over x.

It is then legal to set the coeﬃcients of the slowly varying parts of the variations

equal to zero. This essentially means that we can set the projection of the

coeﬃcients of the variations in Eq. (5.797) equal to zero.

Thus, we get

5.4 Conservation Laws for the Guiding-Center

Plasma

5.4.1 The Noether Method

We now employ Noether’s theorem to deduce conservation laws for the energy-

momentum and the angular momentum of the guiding-center plasma. The tech-

nique has been described by Similon [12], and we shall compare our results to

variation of all the ﬁelds. We start with

his. We begin by considering the variation in the Lagrangian density due to the
Lm, and apply the variation.
Whenever terms involving the derivative of a variation appear, we replace them

L ≡ Lgc +

by a pure divergence minus a term for which the variation is not diﬀerentiated;

this is almost like integration by parts, but since there is no integral sign, we

must keep the pure divergence terms. When we are done, we shall ﬁnd that δ

L
is equal to a pure divergence minus terms, for each ﬁeld present, that consist of

the variation of that ﬁeld times the corresponding equation of motion. Thus, if

we then use the equations of motion, we can reduce δ

to a pure divergence.

L

The algebra is tedious but very straightforward, and we get

5.4.2 Conservation of Energy-Momentum

To derive the conservation law for energy-momentum, we consider variations in

the coordinates that eﬀectively translate in spacetime all the particles of the

plasma, the ﬁelds in the plasma, the external coils that generate the ﬁelds, etc.

Following Similon [12], we write these as follows:

where ξ is a constant vector. Thus, the particles’ position coordinates are pushed

forward without altering any of their other phase space coordinates. The ﬁelds

translate according to the prescription

5.4.3 Conservation of Angular Momentum

To derive the conservation law for angular momentum, we consider variations

in the coordinates that eﬀectively rotate about the origin of spacetime all the

particles of the plasma, the ﬁelds in the plasma, the external coils that generate

the ﬁelds, etc. Following Similon [12], we write these as follows:

where Ω is a constant antisymmetric second rank tensor. Thus, the particles’

coordinates, R, U, and ˆα, transform like vectors undergoing an inﬁnitesimal ro-

tation. The ﬁelds rotate according to the prescription

We pause to interpret our result for the guiding-center spin, Eq. (5.856). In

a preferred frame, F βγ

0 = 0 if either β = 0 or γ = 0, so we need consider only
those components of Sαβγ for which neither β nor γ is zero, as all the rest vanish.

Using Eq. (3.314) for F0 in a preferred frame, we quickly ﬁnd that

where Latin indices run from one to three, as usual. Now in three dimensions

one must take the three-dual of the angular momentum tensor to get the angular

momentum vector. We can now do this for the last two indices of Sαij. The ﬁrst

index is present because the relativistically covariant object is not the angular

momentum itself, but rather its four ﬂux. Taking the three dual, we ﬁnd

Thus, to lowest order in ǫ, when α = 0 we get c times the spin density, which

is the sum over the distribution of guiding centers of the vector with magnitude

γvµ that points in the direction of b. Thus the spin angular momentum for a

single guiding center in a preferred frame may be thought of as having magnitude

γvµ and pointing in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. For α = l

= 0, it is clear

that we get the ﬂux of this quantity, as the integrand has an additonal factor of

5.5 The Guiding-center Plasma in the Presence

of an Eikonal Wave Field

5.5.1 Constructing the System Action

We are now ready to extend the above analysis to the situation for which the

plasma is bathed in an eikonal wave ﬁeld. The full four potential is now

A(x) = A0(x) + ǫA1(x) + λAw(x),

(5.861)

where the eikonal wave four potential

(the

(ǫ) term in ˜F is usually neglected in the eikonal approximation). Note

that F0 and F1 are slowly varying background ﬁelds, while Fw is the rapidly

varying wave ﬁeld. We must now construct the system action for a plasma of

guiding/oscillation centers immersed in this ﬁeld. The presence of the wave ﬁeld

210

The Relativistic Guiding-Center Plasma

has two eﬀects on the system action: It means that the Hamiltonian must now

include the ponderomotive contribution, K2, and it means that the Maxwell

action must now include the wave ﬁeld.

We ﬁrst consider the eﬀect on the Maxwell action. We form

F : F/16π,

−

and note that it contains the product of the slowly varying terms, the product

of the rapidly varying terms, and cross terms. The cross terms are oscillatory

and vanish upon integration over x. The remaining Maxwell action is then

Sm = (Sm)0 + λ2 ˜Sm,

(5.866)

where (Sm)0 is the functional form of the Maxwell action with no wave present

(given by Eqs. (5.771) and (5.773)), and

Z
is the contribution due to the wave. Thus the eﬀective (averaged) Lagrangian

is the contribution due to the wave. Also note that the Lagrange multipliers are

altered by the introduction of K2 (recall that the Lagrange multipliers depend
on the Hamiltonian). Thus λν = (λν)0 + ˜λν, where

˜λν = ξν ·

,

(5.872)

and where the vectors ξν were given in Eq. (3.613) at the end of Chapter 3.

Now K2 can be expressed as a real function of the wave ﬁeld amplitude, ˜F ,

thanks to its manifest gauge invariance. Speciﬁcally, examination of Eq. (4.719)

shows that it is a real quadratic form in the wave ﬁeld amplitude. Thus it can

˜A(x) and ψ(x). Note that the action depends on ˜A only through its dependence
on ˜F , thanks to the manifest gauge invariance of K2; variation with respect to
˜A will yield the dispersion relation for linear plasma waves. Note also that the

action depends on ψ only through its dependence on k =

ψ, thanks to the

averaging out of oscillating terms; thus ψ is an ignorable ﬁeld coordinate, and

variation with respect to it will yield the conservation law for wave action.

Just as we found it useful to denote the dependence of a functional on Ai
and Fi separately, we shall also ﬁnd it useful to denote dependence on ˜A and ˜F

separately. Using Eq. (5.865), the analog of Eq. (5.783) is easily found to be

the equations of motion due to the presence of the ponderomotive Hamiltonian.

Thus, the only modiﬁcation to the kinetic equation due to the wave ﬁeld is the

inclusion of the ponderomotive eﬀects of the wave ﬁeld on the guiding/oscillation

centers of the plasma.

We now have two additional equations of motion due to the variations with
respect to ˜A and ψ. First we consider the variation with respect to ˜A. We use

The dispersion relation for linear plasma waves is found by setting the eigen-

values of the dispersion tensor equal to zero. In “three-plus-one” notation, the

dispersion tensor is three by three and so it has only three eigenvalues that can

be set to zero. It seems that we are ﬁnding an extra branch to the dispersion re-

lation, and one might wonder why this should be so. By multiplying Eq. (5.905)

by kβ, however, it is easy to see that k is a null eigenvector of

. Thus, the

D

The Relativistic Guiding-Center Plasma

217

extra eigenvalue is null, so setting it equal to zero does not yield any new in-

formation. The other three roots yield the more interesting information about

plasma waves.

5.5.5 Conservation of Wave Action

We next consider the equation of motion obtained by varying ψ. Using

Eq. (5.896), we immediately ﬁnd

easy to see that the term involving Λ vanishes, leaving

Finally, we used the equations of motion to simplify the result, just as we did

for the case in which there was no wave ﬁeld present.

Note that the second term on the right hand side of Eq. (5.910) and the

third term on the right of Eq. (5.911) are usually neglected in the eikonal ap-

proximation. They are similar in this respect to the third term on the right of

Eq. (5.895), and the

(ǫ) terms of Eq. (5.865) (which also must be included in

the analysis leading to Eq. (5.909)). Up until now, we have consistently neglected

these terms in our analysis. It will turn out that they are also unneccessary in

deriving the conservation law for energy-momentum, but they are necessary in

the derivation of the conservation law for angular momentum in order to obtain

the correct expression for the modiﬁcation of the guiding-center spin due to the

presence of the wave.

Lm1 that appears in the stress-energy tensor is also cor-

the wave itself. Note that it is the tensor product of the wave action with the

four wavevector. This is sensible since the wave action may be interpreted as

the number ﬂux of wave quanta times some unit of action, and the unit of action

times the four wavevector is the energy-momentum per quantum.

5.5.8 Conservation of Angular Momentum

Finally, we examine the law of conservation of angular momentum. We use the

our result will reduce to Soper’s. Thus, our result may be considered to be an

extension of his result to the case of dielectric media.

The lack of gauge invariance of our result for ˜S is disturbing and will be

discussed further in Chapter 6.

Chapter 6

Questions for Future Study

In this chapter, we discuss some questions raised by this study that could be

topics for future research. These are in no particular order.

The neglect of resonant eﬀects is probably the most glaring omission of

•

this thesis, and probably that most likely to limit its utility. There are

several schools of thought on how to deal with resonant eﬀects, but they

break down into two major categories:

First, there are attempts to simply “patch up” the nonresonant treatment:

For example, since our nonresonant treatment has successfully given us

the hermitian part of the susceptibility tensor, we could use the Kramers-

Kronig relations to get the antihermitian part. Alternatively, we could

simply dictate that all resonant denominators are to be treated according

to the Landau prescription. These methods, while successful in describing

resonant particle eﬀects on plasma waves, fall far short of a uniﬁed descrip-

tion of the eﬀects of resonant particles. Furthermore, there is something

aesthetically displeasing about tricks of this sort.

Second, there are attempts to go back and redo the single particle analyses

to include resonant eﬀects. The general idea is that we ﬁrst went astray

223

224

Questions for Future Study

when we said that we could transform away the ﬁrst order part of the

action due to the eikonal wave ﬁeld. While we can certainly do this far

away from the resonant regions of phase space, we certainly cannot do this

at (or even near) the resonance itself. So we should go back and retain

the ﬁrst order part of the action in the region of phase space near the

resonance. Like the ﬁrst technique, this approach explains certain things

nicely, but falls short of a uniﬁed description of resonant particles. For

example, the ﬁrst order action that we retain will depend on the four

potential of the wave, and this will yield a modiﬁcation to the current

density of a guiding-center plasma that is immersed in a wave ﬁeld; this

is the current drive due to a wave ﬁeld that tokamak researchers study.

On the other hand, a good description of how this residual piece of the

ﬁrst order action gives rise to Landau damping does not seem to exist.

Furthermore, there is a great deal of arbitrariness connected with how to

decide just how much of this ﬁrst order action to keep. One approach

uses “window functions” of some characteristic width, but there is a great

deal of freedom in just how these window functions should look (square

windows, gaussian windows, etc.); Dewar [51] gives a variational principle

for determining optimal window shape, but then we have to worry about

just what we mean by “optimal.” There is also a great deal of freedom

in choosing the width of such windows. If we try to transform away the

ﬁrst order action too close to the resonance, problems develop due to the

presence of the trapped particles, and the transformation ceases to be a

near-identity diﬀeomorphism. Unfortunately, it is hard to quantify what

we mean by “too close” in this regard. Perhaps the window width should

itself be treated as a dynamical variable whose dynamics are given by some

variational principle (like that of Dewar); this might be a useful tool for the

Questions for Future Study

225

•

•

study of “resonance broadening” eﬀects, where the width of the resonant

region varies in time.

Pursuing the oscillation-center Lie transforms to higher order is a natural

and obvious extension of this thesis. In this way, one could study induced

scattering and three-wave phenomena. Past attempts to study these have

either not used systematic perturbation theory (e.g. Lie transforms), or

have used Hamiltonian methods without manifest gauge invariance. This

thesis should provide the tools needed to combine the desiderata of sys-

tematic perturbation theory and manifest gauge invariance. Central to

this eﬀort has been the use of the homotopy formula, and the introduction

of the pair of special functions, Qℓ and Rℓ.

It is interesting to note that this same program could have been carried out

for the nonrelativistic problem. One must simply take the perturbation to

the action due to the wave (for which there now would be both a vector

and a scalar potential), and apply to it the guiding-center Lie transform,

using the homotopy formula in the same way that we did here.

The inclusion of dissipative eﬀects (collisions, correlations, etc.) would

be an important generalization of the work presented here. This is un-

doubtedly related to the problems associated with the inclusion of resonant

eﬀects. A uniﬁed treatment of correlations would yield the appropriate col-

lision operator in the kinetic equation, and modify the energy-momentum

conservation law to describe the ﬂow of energy into heat.

One way to approach this subject might be through the extended use of

projection operators. We employed this technique in Chapter 5 to show

that it was possible for energy-momentum and angular momentum to ﬂow

from one relevent region of Fourier space to another irrelevent one, and

226

Questions for Future Study

thereby to eﬀectively appear as a source term in the conservation laws.

We did not pursue this idea of partitioning Fourier space into one zone

for background ﬁelds, one zone for wave ﬁelds, and one zone for eﬀects of

collisions (for example, we never introduced a second projection operator

for the wave ﬁelds, or a third one for ﬁelds arising in collisions). This

approach may prove useful, but it quickly leads to great complication in the

procedure, and it is not clear how it might give rise to collision operators,

etc.

•

When we applied the Noether method to the action to obtain the guiding-

center spin angular momentum, we used the version of the action that was

both boostgauge and gyrogauge invariant. There is a good reason why we

did this. Other versions contain the quantity

that was introduced back

R

in Chapter 3.

If we had tried to apply Noether’s theorem to an action

containing

, we would at some point have been faced with the question

of how to vary

with respect to the four potential. It seems that

is

R

not independent of the four potential since it was deﬁned in terms of the

R

R

unit vectors, ˆeα, and these, in turn, depend upon the background ﬁeld.

We dodged the issue by going to the boostgauge and gyrogauge invariant

coordinates for which

does not appear in the action, but it is inter-

R

esting to contemplate the alternatives. If we were to simply ignore this

term, we would not get guiding-center spin, and that would be unaccept-

able. Though we had to go to higher order to ﬁnd this term in our ﬁrst

derivation of the guiding-center action, it has the same order as the µdθ

term which is obviously critically important. Indeed, now that we have the

beneﬁt of hindsight, we see that we could have avoided the higher order

guiding-center Lie transform altogether by examining the action at clas-

sical order and asking what we would have to add to it to make the µdθ

Questions for Future Study

227

term gyrogauge invariant. The answer would have been

µ

dR, and

−

R ·

this was really the only important term we found at higher order. Thus,

the clever application of a gauge invariance requirement can save one from

going to higher order in a perturbation calculation!

So, since we can’t ignore this term, how else could we have dealt with it?

There are a couple of possible avenues of approach. First, recall the well

known result that the stress-energy tensor is given by the derivative of the

Lagrangian density with respect to the metric tensor (this is true at least

for spinless systems). There seems to be an analogous theorem (or, at least,

a conjecture) enunciated by Hehl [52], that the spin angular momentum

tensor is the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to torsion.

Torsion is the result of an asymmetric aﬃne connection, and the aﬃne
˙R

connection that we had to introduce in Section 3.11 to explain the
term in ˙Θ is indeed asymmetric. Now it is not clear to me that

is a

R

torsion, but these remarks do make it clear that

has at least something to

do with torsion. In any event,

appears in our guiding-center action with

R

R

a µ in front of it, so it is possible that we could apply the above theorem

(conjecture?) and derive guiding-center spin directly (without recourse to

Noether’s theorem). I suspect that, if this were possible, it would be of

more interest to researchers in quantum gravity (which is the community to

whom reference [52] was aimed) than it would be to researchers in plasma

physics. It may be that guiding-center motion provides a unique classical

forum within which this topic of current research in the ﬁeld of quantum

gravity may be applied, tested, and better understood.

Another possible approach to the spin problem is yet more speculative.

It is suggested by the minimal coupling idea of gauge ﬁeld theory. Recall

that

is the gauge potential associated with the gyrogauge group.

In

R

228

Questions for Future Study

Section 3.11, we even went one step further and derived the corresponding

gauge ﬁeld,

. Using the techniques of gauge ﬁeld theory, it might be

to deﬁne a gauge covariant derivative. We could then

R

:

N

N

add something like

to the Lagrangian density, and treat A and

as independent gauge ﬁelds. Though these ideas are suggested by the

R
analogy with gauge ﬁeld theories, they would all have to be rigorously

justiﬁed. Furthermore, it is not obvious how guiding-center spin would

arise from these considerations.

•

•

Another mystery that should be mentioned is the apparant lack of gauge

invariance of the wave modiﬁcation to guiding-center spin. Our result

is clearly the extension to dielectric media of Soper’s result for the vac-

uum [50]. The lack of gauge invariance did not seem to bother him, except

for a cryptic footnote that indicates that the result is invariant with respect

to a certain subgroup of the full gauge group. One possible explanation

might be that the division of angular momentum into orbital and spin con-

tributions is not a gauge-invariant division. If this were the case, however,

one would expect that neither the orbital nor the spin angular momentum

should be gauge invariant by itself, but that their sum should be gauge in-

variant. Alas, the orbital angular momentum seems to be gauge invariant

all by itself, so the issue remains a mystery.

It would be nice to ﬁnd a Hamiltonian ﬁeld theoretical

formula-

tion of the kinetic and ﬁeld equations for the guiding-center and the

guiding/oscillation-center plasma. Manifestly covariant Hamiltonian ﬁeld

theories are, however, tricky to formulate. We cannot give preference to

the time variable, and the proper time is not uniquely deﬁned (every par-

ticle in the system has its own proper time). There may be ways of getting

around this diﬃculty by generalizing the form of Hamiltonian equations

Questions for Future Study

229

of motion for such systems.

If this could be done, it might be possible

to use the energy-casimir method to study plasma stability to nonlinear

perturbations.

We have developed conservation laws for energy-momentum and angular

•

momentum for the guiding/oscillation-center plasma. In most studies of

plasma dynamics, use is made of energy conservation, but not of momen-

tum or angular momentum conservation (of course, in a covariant rela-

tivistic treatment energy and momentum are inseparable). It is possible

that these conserved quantities could play a far greater role in the study

of, say, plasma stability theory than they have until now. For example, the

Lyapunov method for assessing stability rests heavily on the discovery of

conserved quantities. Just how to go about doing this is not immediately

clear.

Vector Spaces, Dual Spaces,

Algebras, and Modules

This appendix is included to establish the set-theoretical foundations of tensor

calculus and exterior algebra, as these ideas are used extensively in this thesis. It

is intended to provide a review for people already familiar with these topics, and

to establish notation. The reader is expected to be familiar with linear algebra

and with the topology of the real numbers. If anything herein is unfamiliar, the

reader is urged to consult one of the above-mentioned introductory references.

We begin with some set-theoretical notation: Given two sets, A and B, we

deﬁne the Cartesian product, A

B, to be the set of all ordered pairs, (a, b),

such that a

A and b

is read “for all,” and the symbol

∃
is read “there exists.” A set is said to be partitioned if there exist subsets such

∈

∈

∀

×
B. The symbol

that each and every element of the set is a member of one and only one subset.

A map that associates an element of a set, B, to each element of a set, A, is

denoted by A

B.

7→

A relation, R, among the elements of a set, A, is deﬁned to be a subset of

A

A; we write R

A

×

to be related if (a1, a2)

⊂

A. Two elements of A, say a1 and a2, are then said
×
R. In this case, we may write a1 ∼

a2. A relation is

∈
∼
A. A relation that is reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive is called

all a, b, c

∈

an equivalence relation. An equivalence relation naturally partitions a set into

subsets called equivalence classes. Any two members of the same equivalence

class are related to each other by the equivalence relation, and members of

diﬀerent equivalence classes are not related by the equivalence relation. For

example, the equivalence relation of “similarity” partitions the set of all triangles

into an inﬁnity of equivalence classes, and the equivalence relation of “equality

modulo three” partitions the set of integers into three classes. The relation “is

the same height or taller than” is not an equivalence relation on the set of all

trees, because, although it is reﬂexive and transitive, it is not symmetric, etc.

The set of all real numbers will be denoted by

. The set of all n-tuples of

real numbers will be denoted by

n, and the reader is assumed to have some

ℜ

ℜ

familiarity with its usual topology. In particular, by using, say, the Euclidean

norm, it is possible to deﬁne open sets as neighborhoods, and thus to have a

concept of nearness, continuity, convergence, etc.

Condition B.0.8.8

A set of vectors, U1, . . . , Un, is said to be linearly independent if and only if

the only real numbers, c1, . . . , cn, satisfying

c1 ·

U1 +

cn ·

· · ·

Un = 0

(B.925)

are c1 =

= cn = 0. Otherwise, the vectors are said to be linearly dependent.

· · ·

The number of elements in the largest possible set of linearly independent vectors

is called the dimension of the vector space. If a vector space has dimension n,

then any set of n linearly independent vectors constitutes a basis for that vector

space. If V1, . . . , Vn is a basis for

, then any vector, U, in

can be expressed

V

U = a1 ·

V1 +

· · ·

Vn,

(B.926)

where the real constants, a, are uniquely determined by U, and can be computed

by standard techniques of linear algebra. In this case, we say that the basis spans

the vector space. A vector subspace of a vector space,

, is a subset of

that is

V

V

itself a vector space closed under

and +. The dimension of the vector subspace

is the minimal number of basis vectors needed to span it.

Vector spaces can be ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimensional. An example of an inﬁnite

dimensional vector space is the space of all inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable (C∞) real-

valued functions on

. The addition and multiplication operations are then

ℜ

(f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x)

(B.927)

V

·

and

This very important space will be called Λ(

). A basis for this vector space

would have to contain an inﬁnite number of elements; the theory of Fourier series

(a

f )(x) = a

f (x).

·

·

ℜ

(B.928)

246

Vector Spaces, etc.

provides an example of how to go about constructing and using such bases. The

set of all polynomial functions of a real argument is a vector subspace of Λ(

).

A functional, U ∗, operating on a vector space,

, is a map

V

V 7→ ℜ

lently, we can think of functionals as objects which pair with vectors to yield real

numbers. The notation for this pairing is

. Note that we frequently

U ∗, V

h

i ∈ ℜ

denote functionals with superscripted stars. It is possible to deﬁne operations of

addition and real number multiplication on the space of functionals as follows:

It is readily veriﬁed that these operations make the space of all functionals

operating on

into a vector space which we shall denote by

V

shall call the dual space to the vector space,

∗, and which we

V
. Furthermore, it is also readily

V

veriﬁed that the dimensions of

V
linear algebra may be instructive: The dual space to the vector space of column

V

vectors may be identiﬁed with the vector space of row vectors, since a row vector

If a vector space,

is endowed with a further bilinear operation that maps

V

, then it is called an algebra. Since this operation pairs vectors with

V × V 7→ V
other vectors, it can be written in the form (U, V )

. By “bilinear,” we mean

of multiplication of real numbers. The space Λ(

) described above is also a

ℜ

commutative, associative algebra if we equip it with the multiplication

(f g)(x) = f (x)g(x).

(B.933)

In linear algebra, the set of all n by n square matrices is a vector space of

dimension n2 with the usual deﬁnitions of matrix addition and multiplication

by real numbers; it becomes an associative (but not commutative) algebra when

equipped with matrix multiplication.

An algebra,

∀

The space of vectors in

3 becomes a Lie algebra when equipped with the usual

cross product.

ℜ

A vector subspace of an algebra is called a subalgebra if it is closed under the

algebra’s multiplication rule. For example, the space of all polynomial functions

of a real argument is a subalgebra of Λ(

). A subalgebra of a Lie algebra is

ℜ

called a Lie subalgebra.

We can generalize the concept of a vector ﬁeld somewhat by relaxing the

requirement that a and b in Conditions B.0.8.5 through B.0.8.8 above are real

numbers. Suppose instead that they are members of any associative algebra, A.

Then Conditions B.0.8.5 through B.0.8.8 still make sense, though the number 1

that appears in Condition B.0.8.8 must be reinterpreted to refer to the identity

element of the algebra, A. In this case,

is said to be a module over the algebra,

V
A. For example, in linear algebra, the space of column vectors is a module over

the above-described algebra of square matrices.

a given coordinate system are denoted by the same letter in ordinary typeface

(with a superscripted index to label components).

Gyrofrequency Shift for

Two-Dimensional

Nonrelativistic

Guiding-Center Motion

As a straightforward but nontrivial example of the vector Lie transform tech-

nique, we consider two-dimensional nonrelativistic guiding-center motion in a

magnetic ﬁeld of the form

B = B(x, y)ˆz,

(C.936)

and a perpendicular electric ﬁeld of the form

E = Ex(x, y)ˆx + Ey(x, y)ˆy.

(C.937)

To lowest order, the gyrofrequency is given by Ω = eB/mc. We shall address

the problem of computing the correction to this quantity due to the spatial

dependence of B and E.

Though it is most useful and quite elegant to treat this problem with Hamil-

tonian perturbation theory, we shall instead use Lie transforms directly on the

dynamical vector ﬁeld. We do this for the purposes of illustration. In Chapter 3

of this thesis, we treat the much more general problem of relativistic guiding-

center motion in arbitrary electromagnetic ﬁeld geometry in space-time (includ-

ing perpendicular electric ﬁelds that may be order unity in the guiding-center

expansion parameter, ǫ), and there we make full use of the Hamiltonian na-

ture of the equations of motion and we spend a great deal of time studying the

We denote the phase-space coordinates by z = (x, y, w, θ), and the equations

of motion by

˙z =

Gyrofrequency Shift, etc.

253

This is the gyrofrequency shift. The ﬁrst term is the shift due to the spatial

dependence of the perpendicular electric ﬁeld, and the second term is the shift

due to the spatial dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁrst of these terms was

discovered by Kaufman [47] in 1960, who also showed that it gives rise to the

phenomenon of gyroviscosity.

It is interesting to note that, when the results of Chapter 3 are cast into

“1 + 3” notation and the nonrelativistic limit is taken, the ﬁrst of the above pair

of terms is present but the second is not. This is because the ordering scheme

used is quite diﬀerent. In this appendix, we treated the perpendicular electric

ﬁeld as an order ǫ quantity, whereas in Chapter 3 we took it to be order unity.

Thus both terms appear at the same order above (the ﬁrst term has a spatial

gradient and an electric ﬁeld, and the second term has two spatial gradients),

whereas in Chapter 3 the second term would appear at one higher order than

the ﬁrst term (and we did not calculate to high enough order there to see it). It

is also interesting to note that the term involving

in Eq. (3.511) of Chapter 3

R

is a three (or higher) dimensional eﬀect, and has no analog in two-dimensional

guiding-center motion.

All of the Bessel function summation formulas used in Chapter 4 can be derived

from the following theorems:

the usual Bessel function recursion relations

and

and

and the parity rule

where we have used Eq. (E.956) in the second line and have redeﬁned the sum-

mation variable in the third line (we have also omitted explicit indication of the

functional dependence of Jℓ on z since no ambiguity can result from doing so).

This means that fk(z) cannot depend on z, so it is a constant for each value of

k. To ﬁnd the value of this constant, set z equal to zero in Eq. (E.953). Recalling

that Jℓ(0) = δℓ0, we see that fk(z) = δk0, and the theorem is proved.

To verify Eq. (E.954), use the parity rule, Eq. (E.957). We have

(Jℓ+k+1Jℓ−k + J−ℓ−k−1J−ℓ+k)

where we have redeﬁned the summation variable in the ﬁrst line (ℓ

These theorems can be used to derive sum rules with summands that are

quadratic in the Bessel functions. To do this, note ﬁrst that setting k = 0 in

Eqs. (E.953) and (E.954) immediately yields

get rid of the power of ℓ. To derive a sum rule that includes a derivative of a Bessel

function, ﬁrst use Eq. (E.956) to express the Bessel function derivative in terms

of undiﬀerentiated Bessel functions; alternatively, if a sum rule that includes

a Bessel function derivative can be expressed as the derivative of another sum

rule with undiﬀerentiated Bessel functions, then this is usually a better way to

proceed.

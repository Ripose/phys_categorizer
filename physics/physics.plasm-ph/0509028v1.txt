Total absorption of an electromagnetic wave by an overdense plasma

We show both theoretically and experimentally that an electromagnetic wave can be totally ab-
sorbed by an overdense plasma when a subwavelength diﬀraction grating is placed in front of the
plasma surface. The absorption is due to dissipation of surface plasma waves (plasmons-polaritons)
that have been resonantly excited by the evanescent component of the diﬀracted electromagnetic
wave. The developed theoretical model allows one to determine the conditions for the total absorp-
tion.

Media with negative permittivity ε < 0 have re-
Periodically-
cently attracted enhanced attention.
inhomogeneous (perforated or corrugated) optically-
thick metal ﬁlms are anomalously transparent for light
at certain resonance frequencies for which the metal per-
mittivity is negative [1]. Media with both negative per-
mittivity ε < 0 and negative permeability µ < 0, the
so-called left-handed materials (LHM) [2, 3], possess un-
usual properties, in particular the possibility of creating
an “ideal lens” [4] with subwavelength resolution. A com-
mon property for metals with ε < 0 and for LHM is that
the boundary between such media and vacuum supports
propagation of surface waves, the so-called plasmons-
polaritons [5, 6]. In fact, the surface of a medium with
ε < 0 behaves as a surface wave resonator (SWR). The
resonators on both sides of a slab made of an ε < 0 ma-
terial are coupled by their exponentially vanishing ﬁelds.
When one of the resonators is excited by an external ﬁeld,
then, due to the coupling, the second resonator is also
excited. It means that the external ﬁeld leaks through
the slab. When the resonators’ Q-factors are large, the
amplitude of oscillations in the second resonator is the
same as in the ﬁrst one and the slab transparency reaches
100%.

A propagating incident electromagnetic wave cannot
excite the SWR. Only non-propagating, evanescent waves
for which ω/c < k⊥ (ω is the wave frequency and k⊥ is
the tangential component of the wavenumber ~k) can play
the role of a pump mode and excite the resonator. Ex-
actly such waves excite the SWR of an LHM slab and
enable restoration with subwavelength resolution of the
image of the wave source at the opposite side of the slab.
There are two ways to excite the SWR on a metal sur-
face by an incident electromagnetic wave. It is possible
to modify the metal surface so that the modiﬁed sur-
face waves can be in resonance with the electromagnetic
wave. The second way consists of a transformation (par-
tial or complete) of the propagating incident wave into
an evanescent one. The ﬁrst way is realized by form-
ing periodical inhomogeneities on the metal surface. The
second way can be realized by total internal reﬂection at
a near-boundary inhomogeneity of ε [7, 8] or by using a
diﬀraction grating [9].

The plasma permittivity ε = 1
ω < ωp (here ωp is the plasma frequency). In spite of
such similarity of metal and plasma, all experimental in-
vestigations have been carried out with metal ﬁlms only
and with electromagnetic waves in the visible or near-
infrared frequency bands.
In this Letter we report for
the ﬁrst time on an experimental observation of strong
absorption of microwaves by an overdense plasma due to
excitation of surface plasma waves.

The application of diﬀraction gratings for partial trans-
formation of incident propagating electromagnetic waves
into evanescent ones is the most convenient for plasma
experiments. Note that forming a special proﬁle of the
plasma density, as suggested in Ref. [8], is considerably
more diﬃcult. It seems that by placing two diﬀraction
gratings on the opposite sides of a plasma layer it is possi-
ble to realize electromagnetic wave transmission through
ω. The
an overdense plasma with ωp > ω or even ωp ≫
transparency of such a “sandwich” with a dissipationless
plasma inside reaches 100% [9]. However, it is practically
impossible to realize such a situation experimentally. The
point is that the coupling between the SWRs on the two
sides of the plasma layer decreases exponentially when
one increases the layer thickness. The weaker is the cou-
pling between resonators, the more easily can dissipa-
tion destroy this coupling. The resonators are in fact
isolated and excitation is not transmitted from one res-
onator to the other, i. e. the electromagnetic energy does
not pass through the plasma layer. Since it is practically
impossible to create a dense plasma in a very thin layer,
the transmission of an electromagnetic wave through an
overdense plasma is also impossible. Note that the same
destructive role of dissipation signiﬁcantly restricts the
subwavelength resolution of the “ideal lens” [10].

In practice an incident electromagnetic wave can ex-
cite only one SWR on one side of the plasma layer. How-
ever, the resonant interaction of the electromagnetic wave
with the plasma surface can manifest itself in a total ab-
sence of a reﬂected wave. The incident wave is completely
transformed into a surface wave which dissipates in the
plasma. This is the phenomenon of the total absorption

The problem of excitation of surface waves is equiv-
alent to the problem of resonator excitation [9]. Using
this analogy, let us consider the problem of wave trans-
mission through a one-dimensional resonator with semi-
transparent walls. The transparency of the two walls will
be characterized by transmission coeﬃcients T1 and T2.
Let us ﬁrst consider the resonator without a pump
wave. The energy Wr stored in the resonator can be
expressed through a complex amplitude Er of ﬁeld oscil-
lations:

where N is the resonator eigenmode norm. The resonator
energy loss is determined by the dissipation in the res-
onator and by the energy ﬂux through the walls. The
dissipative energy loss can be written in the form:

Let us make use of the analogy between a resonator
and an oscillator and consider an oscillator with eigen-

with the corresponding characteristics of the resonator.

Let us now consider the problem of the resonator ex-
citation by a wave which falls on the left resonator wall.
Let the incident wave amplitude be E0. The amplitude
of the wave that penetrates the resonator is √T1E0. The
ﬁeld of this wave appears as an external force in the os-
cillator equation:

where q is some complex coeﬃcient. One cannot put
q = 1 because not only the phase of the ﬁeld that pen-
etrates the resonator is unknown, but also the eﬃciency
of the resonator excitation by this ﬁeld is unknown. This
eﬃciency is determined by the projection of the pene-
trating ﬁeld on the ﬁeld of the resonator eigenmode.

Using the solution of Eq. (7), one can write the follow-

There are many examples that in systems analogous
to the one under consideration when dissipation is ab-
sent (γ = 0), the transmission coeﬃcient at a resonance
frequency is equal to unity when the system possesses a
mirror symmetry.
In quantum mechanics it is the res-
onant tunnelling through a symmetric two-humped po-
tential barrier [11]. Localized states in disordered media
and resonant transmission which is associated with these
states, present another example of a symmetric system
[12]. Examples that are closer to the problem under con-
sideration have been described in Refs. [13, 14, 15]. It
is reasonable to suppose that our system also possesses
the same property, namely the transmission coeﬃcient
2 reaches unity (and the reﬂection coef-
T =

ﬁcient R vanishes) at the resonance frequency when dis-
sipation is absent, γ = 0, and the system is symmetric,
i. e. T1 = T2. It follows from the condition T = 1 and
the deﬁnition (6) for α that

The reﬂection is minimal at the resonance frequency and
we will put further ω = ωr. In the problem under con-
sideration the second wall of the resonator, namely the
plasma body, is opaque, T2 = 0. In spite of the mirror
symmetry breakdown, the reﬂection coeﬃcient vanishes
under a certain condition. Indeed, by setting T2 = 0 in
Eq. (11), one can obtain:

Thus, the reﬂection coeﬃcient is equal to zero when the
dissipation coeﬃcient γ is equal to a certain critical value

γc = T1vg/(2N ). The analogous phenomenon in sym-
metric systems is known as critical coupling [14, 15].

The phenomenological parameter T1 which appears in
the developed theoretical model, can be estimated in the
following way. Let η be the transformation ratio of the
propagating wave into the evanescent one on the grat-
kvd), where d is the distance
ing. Then T
between the grating and the plasma boundary, and kv is
the spatial decrement of the evanescent wave amplitude
in vacuum. This parameter plays in our theory the same
role as the coupling coeﬃcient in [14, 15].

The results of the above simple theory are in good
agreement with the solution of a complete system of
equations which describe the diﬀraction of the incident
wave in the grating and the interaction of the diﬀracted
ﬁelds with the dissipative overdense plasma. It was as-
sumed in the calculations that the grating is subwave-
length, i. e. the grating wavenumber kg > ω/c. It has
been found that the reﬂection coeﬃcient as a function
of ω is minimal, R(ω) = Rmin, when the wavenum-
ber k⊥ = kx + kg (where kx is the projection of the
wavenumber ~k of the incident wave on the grating plane)
coinsides with the wavenumber ks of the plasma surface
wave which propagates in the x direction:

where k0 = ω/c. The ﬁelds of the surface wave decay
exponentially on both sides of the plasma boundary. This
surface wave forms the resonator considered above.

As an example, the dependence of Rmin on the normal-
ized dissipation coeﬃcient Γ = γ/ωp for certain values of
η and d is presented in Fig. 1. The critical coupling eﬀect
is clearly visible in this picture.

dissipation coeﬃcient Γ.

In our experiments the ferroinductor coupled plasma
discharge [16] was used as the plasma source. The plasma
appears as a result of a gas breakdown due to the electric
ﬁeld surrounding a ferrite core with a large µ, when an rf

3

voltage is applied to the core primary winding. We used a
1 ms pulse of rf with a frequency of 240 kHz. This source
produces a dense homogeneous plasma, the density of
which can be varied over a large range by varying the
gas pressure and/or the power of the plasma source. In
such source no magnetic ﬁeld exists in the plasma volume
and at its boundary as well. In the absence of magnetic
ﬁeld, a surface plasma wave can propagate on the plasma
boundary.

A sketch of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2.
Two movable thin plastic plates were located on each side
of the core. These plates bordered the volume ﬁlled with
the plasma and in fact created the homogeneous plasma
considered in the theory. To measure the plasma density
spatial distribution we used a movable single probe. In-
deed the plasma inhomogeneity along the chamber axis
did not exceed 5%. Also in the radial direction the
plasma density fall did not exceed 10% at a distance of
8-9 cm from the chamber axis. Due to the movable plates
the thickness of the plasma layer could be varied in the
range of 9-20 cm. The plasma density np could reach
1012 cm−3. The neutral gas pressure p was varied
4.5
10−3 Torr of Xe. The
within the range of 2
2
ionization level was varied within the range of 7–30% for
the high and low pressures respectively. The electron
temperature was found to be about 4 eV and the elec-
107 sec−1 at the
tron collision frequency should reach 3
highest pressure.

microwave receiving antenna, 6 – diﬀraction grating.

Two rectangular microwave horn antennas were placed
close to the outer surfaces of the plastic plates. In these
plates in front of the horn openings were made windows,
which were covered by thin (0.2 mm) teﬂon ﬁlms in order
to prevent microwave reﬂection from the plates. One of
these horns was connected via a ferrite circulator to a
microwave oscillator with wavelength λ = 3.2 cm. This
circulator allowed us to separate the input and reﬂected
microwave signals. The other horn was used in order to
verify the probe measurements by the microwave cut-oﬀ
method.

The experiments were carried out with a diﬀraction
grating which consisted of a periodical set of metal strips
of 11 mm width and a period of 20 mm. The distance
d between this grating and the plasma boundary could

·

be varied in the range of 3-15 mm. The electromagnetic
wave was incident normal to the grating and the plasma
surfaces, i. e. k⊥ = kg. Under such circumstances, we
obtain from Eq. (13) that the plasma surface wave should

Typical waveforms of the reﬂected wave and probe sig-
nals are shown in Fig. 3. The time intervals before the
ﬁrst vertical line and after the second one should be ex-
cluded from our consideration. The reason is that they
correspond either to the initial stage of the gas break-
down and plasma formation (the ﬁrst interval) or to the
plasma decay after the driving pulse termination (the
last interval) while we should deal only with the middle
interval which corresponds to a stationary plasma.

Several experiments were carried out in order to cover a
broad range of plasma densities, nc < np < 4nc. Within
all this range the reﬂection coeﬃcient R was close to unity
2.7 nc where it
except for a narrow range of np ≃
had a deep minimum at a certain resonance density nr,
R(nr) = Rmin. Indeed in this range the value of R was
several fold smaller than the reﬂection from the grating
0.8). The dependencies R(np) for various d
itself (Rg ≃
and p are presented in Fig. 4. The value of nr was found
to be only weakly dependent on the parameters d and p,
and independent of the distance between the plates. On
the other hand the value of Rmin did depend on d and p
more strongly. By varying p, the minimum value of Rmin
at each d depended on d nonmonotonically. The smallest
of all values of Rmin, namely Rmin ≃
0.14, corresponds
0.3 for
to a distance of d = 9 mm (for instance Rmin ≃
0.5 for d = 13 mm). It seems likely
d = 5 mm and Rmin ≃
that the critical coupling takes place when d is close to
9 mm.

mentally that total absorbtion of electromagnetic waves

may be achieved in overdense plasmas when a prop-
erly designed diﬀraction grating is placed in front of
the plasma boundary. This phenomenon is caused by
resonant excitation of surface plasma waves, plasmons-
polaritons, and their dissipation in the plasma. Such
possibility of total microwave absorption is very attrac-
tive for a number of important applications, e. g. plasma
heating and nonreﬂecting coating.

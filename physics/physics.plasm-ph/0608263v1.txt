First experimental measurements are presented for the kink instability in a linear plasma column
which is insulated from an axial boundary by ﬁnite sheath resistivity. Instability threshold below the
classical Kruskal-Shafranov threshold, axially asymmetric mode structure and rotation are observed.
These are accurately reproduced by a recent kink theory, which includes axial plasma ﬂow and one
end of the plasma column that is free to move due to a non-line-tied boundary condition.

The current driven kink instability is a magnetohydro-
dynamic (MHD) instability which aﬀects current carry-
ing plasmas in Nature and laboratory. The kink mode
structure and stability condition are strongly dependent
on the system geometry and the boundary conditions
(BCs). Kruskal[1] and Shafranov [2] (hereafter referred
to as KS) considered ﬁrst the ideal MHD stability of a
cylindrical plasma column with magnetic ﬁeld compo-
nents (0, Bθ, Bz) using cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z).
For an inﬁnitely long (equivalent to periodic axial BCs)
column, they obtained a linearly unstable helical kink
mode of structure ξ = ei(θ+2πz/L) when the plasma cur-
rent Ip exceeds the Kruskal-Shafranov limit

IKS = (2π)2a2Bz/(µ0L)

where a and L are, respectively, the radius and length
of the current channel, and ξ is the displacement of the
plasma column from the equilibrium position. The KS
theory has been quite successful in predicting the behav-
ior of toroidal plasmas for which the periodic BCs yield a
proper accounting for the ﬁnite length of the system. In
linear systems, however, substantial deviations from KS
predictions can result from diﬀerent axial BCs.

The importance of the BCs has long been recognized[3,
4] and is of particular relevance to the stability of line-
tied ﬂux ropes in space physics (c.f. Ref. [5] and survey
Ref. [6]), and astrophysical jets[7]. In recent years, there
has been a renewed interest in the stability of a line-tied
plasma column in laboratory devices (see Refs. [8, 9, 10]
and references therein). The kink stability of a plasma
column with line-tied ends has been investigated in linear
devices, where line-tying is attributed to the presence of
highly conducting end plates[11], and in open systems to
a local discontinuity for the Alfv´en velocity that forms a
virtual boundary around the system[12, 13].

In this Letter, we experimentally investigate the exter-
nal kink instability in conditions where one end of the
plasma column is line-tied to the plasma source, and the
other end is not line-tied and therefore free to slide over
the surface of the end-plate. The latter BC is a result
of plasma sheath resistance that insulates, at least par-
tially, the plasma from the end-plate. Compared to the

line-tied case, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the kink
mode structure and lower critical current for the onset of
the kink. The axial ﬂow velocity, the direction of the ax-
ial magnetic ﬁeld, and the rotation frequency of the kink
mode are all correlated. The experimental results agree
with the predictions from a recent theory of the external
kink instability for a slender plasma column[14].

The experiments are conducted in the Reconnec-
tion Scaling Experiment (RSX) which uses electrostatic
plasma guns to generate the plasma[15]. Figure 1 shows
the experimental setup with a view of the plasma gun
located at z = 0 and radially inserted into the center of
the RSX cylindrical vacuum vessel (4 m length and ra-
dius rwall = 0.2 m). A hydrogen arc plasma is ejected to
form a cylindrical plasma column in a constant, uniform,

for dominantly axial ﬂow constrained by experimentally
measured axial gradients in pressure and density. A cur-
rent is driven in the plasma by negatively biasing the gun
with respect to an external anode (0.05 m2 stainless steel
plate) which is electrically isolated from the vacuum ves-
sel. The external anode can be positioned at diﬀerent
axial locations z = 0.3

the current-carrying plasma column to be varied.

The MHD activity is monitored by two arrays of mag-
netic probes that include a total of seven coils inserted
in the vacuum vessel at rp = 0.15 m to measure the az-
imuthal magnetic ﬁeld Bθ. In the axial array, Fig. 1-(3),
four magnetic probes are positioned at θ = π/2 (top of
the vessel) and axially located at z = 0.14, 0.48, 0.62 and
0.76 m. In the azimuthal array, Fig. 1-(4), the four mag-
netic probes are located at z = 0.48 m and azimuthally
equispaced by π/2. One magnetic probe is shared by the
two arrays. Signals are digitized at 20 MHz.

In Fig. 2(a), the time evolution of the plasma current
measured at the external anode is shown for a discharge
with L = 0.92 m. The plasma current starts at t = 0

that the PNLT BC applies to the external anode.

It should be emphasized here that the measurements
in this Letter only characterize the global structure of
the external kink mode. Although some of the obser-
vations (e.g., axial structure and rotation frequency of
the mode) show some resemblance with measurements of
internal drift-Alfv´en waves in ﬁnite-β plasmas with ax-
ial current[17], additional internal measurements will be
needed to investigate the presence of these waves in our
experiment.

In summary, we have presented ﬁrst experimental re-
sults for the current driven kink instability in a plasma
column with one free end that is not line-tied to its
boundary due to a ﬁnite sheath resistance. Mode struc-
ture and instability threshold are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from predictions from the Kruskal-Shafranov theory and
are accurately reproduced by a recently developed kink

Interaction between dust grains near a
conducting wall

Abstract

The eﬀect of the conducting electrode on the interaction of dust
grains in a an ion ﬂow is discussed. It is shown that two grains levitat-
ing above the electrode at the same height may attract one another.
This results in the instability of a dust layer in a plasma sheath.

1 Introduction

A good deal of experiments in dusty plasma physics are performed with
aerosol grains suspended in the plasma sheath. A negatively charged dust
grain in the sheath levitates above a horizontal electrode due to the balance
of two forces: the gravity force directed downwards and the sheath electric
ﬁeld that pushes the grain upwards. The near-sonic or the supersonic ion ﬂow
in the sheath creates the wake ﬁeld downstream of the grain. Since the latter
is conﬁned by a certain Mach cone, it is commonly accepted that the wake
ﬁeld aﬀects the motion of grains, which are situated downstream only. The
usual assumption is that the intergrain potential is smooth in the horizontal
direction, i.e., two grains levitating at the same height repel one another via
the screened Coulomb potential. The structure of the wake ﬁeld and the
grain interaction in an ion ﬂow were studied in details [1-5]. The asymmetric
interaction of vertically aligned grains was also observed experimentally [6].

Analytical theory and computer simulations cited above assumed that
the plasma density is constant and the inﬂuence of the conducting electrode
is negligible. Although both assumptions evidently fail under conditions of a
real plasma sheath, taking into account the plasma non-uniformity seems to
be a very diﬃcult problem. In order to estimate the inﬂuence of the electrode
upon grain interaction, here I use the zeroth approximation, which however,
seems the only one treatable analytically.

In the present paper, the following simple model is accepted. Let there
be the monoenergetic ion stream entering a conducting electrode (or a grid)
located at the horizontal plane, z = 0. The stream velocity, u, exceeds the
ion thermal velocity but it is much less than the electron thermal velocity.
Electrons are Boltzmann distributed. Two problems are addressed: ﬁrst, how
does the electrode modify the interaction between two grains levitating at
the same height and, second, how this aﬀects the spectrum of dust acoustic
waves propagating along a single dust layer.

2 Intergrain interaction

The electrostatic potential produced by a point charge, Q, located at r = r0
is given by the solution of the Poisson equation

where ˆε is the operator of the static dielectric permittivity of an ambient

where u is the velocity of the ion ﬂow, ωi is the ion plasma frequency and
kD is the inverse electron Debye length. The ion ﬂow is parallel to the z axis
and directed downwards, u < 0.

In unbounded plasma, the natural boundary condition for Eq. (1) is

The spatial structure of the potential is recovered by the Fourier transform
of the Green function (7) with respect to k⊥. The ﬁrst term in parenthesis in
expression (7) gives rise to the Debye-H¨uckel potential distorted by the ion
ﬂow, while the second term represents the wake ﬁeld situated downstream of
the charge [1-3]. The opening of the Mach cone conﬁning the wake and the
ﬁeld structure inside it depend on the stream velocity.

Now we turn to the evaluation of the electric potential of a charge located
near a conducting wall. Let the wall be situated at z = 0 plane, while the
charge is placed above it, z0 > 0. Then the potential is given by the solution
of Eq.(1) supplemented with the boundary condition ϕ
|z=0 = 0. As it is
well-known from electrostatics, we can make allowance for this boundary

One may doubt whether description a bounded dispersive medium in
terms of the response function of an unbounded medium is justiﬁable. How-
ever, more accurate and lengthy calculations give the same result. The phys-
ical reason is that there are no ions reﬂected by the conducting wall within
the present model. The mathematical reason is that Eq. (1) actually masks
a set of partial diﬀerential equations with two real characteristics directed
downwards.

Of particular interest for the following is the interaction potential of two

charges placed at the same height, z0. Since

Gk⊥(z0, z0) =

This expression may be interpreted as a mirror reﬂection of the wake ﬁeld

The numerically evaluated example of the potential (15) demonstrating
the attraction is depicted in Fig. 1. It should be pointed out that the in-
equality (16) guarantees the long-scale attraction between grains. With the
opposite inequality imposed on a and µ, the potential is repulsive at large
distance but the attractive branch may appear at smaller scales, as shown in
Fig. (2).

(cid:17)

Evidently, the existence of the attractive branch of the interparticle in-
teraction may result in formation of various patterns and clusters even in
the absence of the external potential well conﬁning grains in the horizontal
direction. Also, the even distribution of grains in a dust layer may become
unstable. The latter possibility is discussed in the next section.

Now consider a two-dimensional gas consisting of dust grains hovering over
the conducting electrode.
Ignoring intergrain correlations, the linearized
equations of motion are written as

The intergrain interaction is described by the potential given by Eqs. (11).
Although the grain charge, Q, generally depends on the ambient plasma
parameters, for simplicity we ignore its variability.

Assuming that all quantities are proportional to exp(

easily get the dispersion relation for the gas oscillations:

Evidently, the layer is unstable, i.e., Im ω > 0, if Gk⊥(z0, z0) < 0. In the long-
wave limit this is possible in the subsonic ﬂow only and the corresponding
constraint coincides with Eq. (16). More detailed investigation shows that the
potential, G⊥(z0, z0), is always positive if µ < 1. However, in the subsonic
regime, µ > 1, there are regions of instability, that is, Gk⊥(z0, z0) < 0 if
0 < q⊥ < qmax(a, µ). The latter are shown as shadowed areas in Fig. 3. With

4 Conclusion

To summarize, we have shown that the presence of the conducting wall may
drastically change the electrostatic interaction of the dust grains in an ion

ﬂow. In particular, the electrostatic image of the grain wake ﬁeld may result
in attraction between grains levitating at the same height that, in its turn,
yields the Jeans-type instability of the dust layer.

It would be unduly naive to draw quantitative conclusions from the
present calculations. However, it seems reasonable that even in a real plasma
sheath, which is essentially non-uniform, the electrostatic image of the grain
wake ﬁeld may also aﬀect the motion of another grains outside the Mach
cone. Although in most experiments the screened Coulomb interaction is
observed, there are indications that the intergrain potential may be more
complicated. It was recently reported that, under certain conditions, a void,
i.e., a dust-free region, appears in a central part of a single dust layer [7]. The
emergence of a two-dimensional void in a layer consisting of some hundreds
of grains can hardly be explained in the same manner as a three-dimensional
void; the latter requires strong inﬂuence of the dust component upon the
discharge structure [8]. Although currently one cannot exclude that some
additional external forces appeared in the experiment [7], we can conjecture
that the 2D void formation is provided by complicated intergrain interaction,

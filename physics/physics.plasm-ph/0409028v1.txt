Luminescence as a mechanism for terahertz emission from femtosecond laser-induced plasmas is
studied. By using a fully microscopic theory, Coulomb scattering between electrons and ions is
shown to lead to luminescence even for a spatially homogeneous plasma. The spectral features
introduced by the rod geometry of laser-induced plasma channels in air are discussed on the basis
of a generalized mode-function analysis.

PACS numbers: 52.20.-j,52.25.Os

The past decade has seen increasing activity in the gen-
eration and detection of far-infrared or terahertz (THz)
radiation with accompanying increase in applications, in-
cluding time-domain THz spectroscopy, and THz tomog-
raphy [1]. Current THz sources have limited spatial ex-
tent (µm to mm), such as transient antenna emitters,
sources based on optical rectiﬁcation, and quantum cas-
cade lasers. A notable exception is the observation of
THz radiation emitted from plasma channels induced in
air by femtosecond (fs) infrared ﬁlaments [2, 3, 4], or light
strings, that can extend over centimeters [5, 6, 7, 8]. The
extension of these results to other media oﬀers the pos-
sibility of a new variety of extended THz sources.

THz for typical THz wavelengths.

In addition to the technological importance of light
strings for realizing THz sources, the mechanism of THz
emission raises basic physics issues. To date most theory
and experiments on coherent THz emission in air have
µm3 [9],
considered localized plasmas with volumes
much less than λ3
In
contrast, light string induced plasmas can be signiﬁcantly
longer than λTHz along the propagation direction of the
exciting laser meaning that coherent emissions from dif-
ferent locations in the plasma need not add constructively
[10]. In this Letter, we propose incoherent light emission
by a two-component plasma as a viable mechanism for
THz emission since this does not rely on the establish-
ment of relative phases between emissions from diﬀerent
locations in the plasma. We develop a microscopic the-
ory which includes the Coulomb interaction between the
charge carriers and the light-matter interaction with a
quantized light ﬁeld. First we show that even a homo-
geneous plasma can produce broad-band radiation in the
form of luminescence due to the electron-ion scattering.
Second we make a mode function analysis for the speciﬁc

rod-like geometry for light string induced plasmas in air
in order to explore the angular dependence of the THz
emission.

and ΓOD in Eq. (8). We numerically conﬁrmed that
emission due to electron-electron scattering is negligi-
ble compared to the electron-ion scattering. Additional
mechanisms such as electron-neutral scattering will in-
crease the scattering rates but are not expected to change
the qualitative picture. A microscopic description of the

the photon assisted correlations.
Inspection of the de-
nominator in Eq. (9) shows that an electron changes mo-
mentum due to Coulomb interaction with an ion. The
corresponding change in kinetic energy is accounted for
by photon emission while the total change of momentum
of the electron is absorbed by the heavy ions.

the range of typical excess energies of about 0.25 eV for
multi-photon ionization. We observe that the spectra are
sharply peaked around ω = 0. The emission at ω = 0 is
mainly determined by the plasma temperature while the
width of the emission tail increases with elevated density.
In order to understand these results, we approximate the
microscopic (k-dependent) scattering matrices by an ef-
fective constant damping rate γeﬀ. In that case, Eq. (8)
can be formally solved and inserted into Eq. (7), which
upon assuming Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions for the
electrons and taking the low density limit yields

If we take the main feature of Eq. (9) and assume that
γeﬀ increases linearly with density, we see that the high
frequency luminescence is proportional to ω2
n2
while the low frequency behaviour is determined by
ω2
1 and thus independent of density. For low fre-
pl/γeﬀ ∝
quencies, Fig. 1 also exhibits the trend of decreasing emis-
sion strength with decreasing temperature. The observed
insensitivity of the high-frequency spectrum on temper-
ature, however, cannot be explained with Eq. (10). Nev-
ertheless, this equation can be used to ﬁt an estimate for
typical scattering times. For the case of n = 1016 cm−3
and T = 3000 K we obtain a scattering time of the order
of 2.5 ps.

Another shortcoming of Eq.(10) lies in the fact that for
high frequencies it is proportional to 1/ω2 such that the
integrated power density proportional to ω2 I PL
q,σ becomes
divergent. In contrast, the microscopic, frequency depen-
dent scattering leads to an exponential decay of ω2 I PL

as shown in the inset of Fig. 1.
In order to obtain an
estimate for the conversion eﬃciency of emission into the

So far, we have completely neglected the inﬂuence of
the A2-contribution to the Hamiltonian. Instead of in-
cluding the resulting terms into the equations of mo-
tion, we pursue a diﬀerent approach. We approximate
the density operator in Eq. (3) by its factorized expec-
tation and assume that the overall density proﬁle varies
slowly enough to be taken as constant.
In that case,
H e
A2 is quadratic in the ﬁeld in analogy to HL. The com-
bined H e
A2 +HL can be diagonalized by choosing the light
modes according to the generalized Helmholtz equation

approximately three-dimensional environment.
In that
case, we ﬁnd only one modiﬁcation that the lumines-
cence spectrum is multiplied by a frequency-dependent
mode function. For a thin slab of constant density with
a thickness d well below typical emission wavelengths,
this prefactor for emission perpendicular to the plane of
the plasma is simply given by

Thus, we see how frequencies well below the plasma fre-
quency are eﬀectively blocked out. The shaded area in
Fig. 1 shows the resulting spectrum for an assumed thick-
ness d = 3 µm. For thicknesses d
c/ωpl all frequencies
below the plasma frequencies would be completely absent
in the emission.

The geometry of a laser induced light string enters
our computations in exactly the same way. The eigen-
modes have to be computed according to Eq. (11) in
the presence of the spatial density proﬁle n(r) of the
plasma column[15]. Our problem has well separated
length scales, namely, the thermal wavelength of the elec-
1 nm is much smaller than the diameter of
trons λth ≃
the plasma column R
30 µm, which is in turn much
smaller than typical THz wavelengths λTHz. As far as

solved for the eigenmodes of Eq. (11) by using a trans-
fer matrix technique, extending the approach of Ref. [16]
to oblique incidence. All solutions can be classiﬁed by
the wave vector q of an incoming plane wave and its po-
larization σ distinguishing between TM-mode (incident
electric ﬁeld in the plane of incidence) and TE-mode (in-
cident electric ﬁeld perpendicular to electron string).

is presented in Fig. 2 for the case of a step-like density
proﬁle with a carrier density of n = 1016 cm−3 over a
cylinder with radius R = 30 µm. For frequencies well
below the plasma frequency, we ﬁnd a dipole radiation
pattern qualitatively similar to that observed experimen-
tally in Ref. [3]. The main emission for those frequen-
cies is perpendicular to the plasma rod aligned along the
horizontal axis of Fig. 2. This emission pattern can be
traced back to the increasing suppression of light modes
below the plasma frequency as the emission angle de-
viates more from the normal direction. For frequencies
around and above the plasma frequency, the angle de-
pendence drastically changes since this suppression does
not exist anymore. For certain frequencies and emission
angles resonance eﬀects can be observed which depend on
the precise choice of parameters. In the given example,
we observe a preferred emission angle around 40 degrees.
The mode strength of the TE-mode does not strongly
depend on the angle of incidence since for any angle the
electric ﬁeld component lies perpendicular to the light
string.

In summary, we presented a microscopic theory for the
photoluminescence emitted from fs laser-induced plas-
mas, and have shown that even a homogeneous two-
component plasma can emit due to electron-ion scatter-
ing. The angle dependence of the THz emission for light
string induced plasmas was explored using modal anal-
ysis, a dipole pattern for emission frequencies below the
plasma frequency being found in qualitative agreement

4

with the recent experiment [3]. In contrast, a drastically
diﬀerent angle dependence for emission frequencies above
the plasma frequency is predicted. Finally, we note that
although our analysis was motivated by studies of THz
emission in air [2, 3, 4], our results apply more gener-
ally, for example, to glasses or electron-hole plasmas in
semiconductors.

The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions describing average motion of a relativistic particle
under the action of a slightly inhomogeneous intense laser ﬁeld are obtained. In weak low-frequency
background ﬁelds, such a particle on average drifts with an eﬀective, relativistically invariant mass,
which depends on the laser intensity. The essence of the proposed ponderomotive formulation is
presented in a physically intuitive and mathematically simple form, yet represents a powerful tool
for studying various nonlinear phenomena caused by interaction of currently available smooth ultra-
intense laser pulses with plasmas.

The latest advances in high-power laser technology
have resulted in the development of laser systems capable
of delivering superstrong electromagnetic pulses, which
can be focused to intensities as high as 1021 W/cm2 [1],
with even more powerful systems coming up in the near
future [2]. The currently obtainable laser ﬁelds can ac-
celerate electrons up to ultra-relativistic oscillatory ve-
locities, previously unachievable in experiments on laser-
matter interaction. This revolutionary progress is now
giving a new life to theoretical studies on particle be-
havior under the action of intense electromagnetic radia-
tion. The conventional models describing various nonlin-
ear phenomena in plasmas illuminated by high-frequency
radiation nowadays need to be revised, as new, ultra-
powerful laser systems are becoming available for lab-
oratory experiments. To explain the already observed
phenomena and predict new eﬀects taken place under
the action of intense laser drive, adequate description of
single-particle motion under relativistically strong radia-
tion must be developed ﬁrst.

Currently, particle motion is well-understood when the
only forces present are those from the wave of uniform in-
tensity [3]. However, to study the guiding center dynam-
ics in inhomogeneous laser radiation or drifts determined
by the presence of low-frequency background ﬁelds, ad-
ditional analysis is needed. Expanding the conventional
understanding to this area would result in a substan-
tial progress in studying a number of plasma physics
problems, such as, e. g., Coulomb collisions and ener-
getic particle production in strong laser ﬁelds. Moreover,
the hydrodynamics and the electrodynamics of laser-
illuminated plasmas would readily be available for gen-
eral revision.

Often, the dynamics of a particle moving in a high-
frequency ﬁeld is described in terms of the ponderomotive
approach. In nonrelativistic ponderomotive description,
the eﬀect of high-frequency electromagnetic forces on a
particle is replaced by particle interaction with an aver-
age potential, linear on the intensity of laser radiation
[4]. When ultra-intense lasers are employed, this conven-
tional description needs to be generalized to relativistic

motion. Contrary to the degenerate case of a circularly
polarized ﬁeld, in which high-frequency variations of the
relativistic mass can be neglected [5], the problem of par-
ticle motion in the case of a linear or elliptic polarization
represents a certain challenge, but still can be studied
analytically.

To describe the drift particle dynamics in such ﬁelds,
recently, multiple studies were performed. Under various
approximations, it was shown that the oscillating par-
ticle guiding center drifts in a smooth laser ﬁeld with
an eﬀective mass, which depends on the electromagnetic
ﬁeld intensity [6, 7, 8, 9]. (In strongly nonuniform laser
ﬁelds though, the particle dynamics is more complicated
[6, 10].) The Hamiltonian treatment of the relativis-
tic drift under intense laser drive has been proposed in
[11], though the problem of interaction with low-
Ref.
frequency background ﬁelds has not been studied. The
ﬁrst steps towards developing the general formalism with
such interaction were made in Ref.
[8]. However, only
smooth (compared to the amplitude of oscillations) low-
frequency background ﬁelds were taken into considera-
tion and the relativistic drift motion equations were in-
duced without proper justiﬁcation.

These shortcomings are overcome in our paper, which
major emphasis is twofold. First, we propose a general,
fully relativistic Lagrangian formulation of ponderomo-
tive description of particle motion under the action of a
quasi-monochromatic slightly inhomogeneous laser ﬁeld.
The proposed approach is physically intuitive yet more
systematic and simple in comparison with those discussed
previously. After natural generalization, it allows includ-
ing particle interaction with weak background forces, ad-
ditional to those from the laser ﬁeld. The discussion on
that aspect of the guiding center motion constitutes the
second emphasis of our work. We show the eﬀective mass
concept to be applicable to ponderomotive description of
relativistic particle motion in low-frequency background
ﬁelds, including even ones of small spatial scale compared
to the amplitude of oscillations. In the end, we discuss
the most promising applications of the proposed formu-
lation and summarize our main ideas. To start, consider

r stands for the phase of the wave,
where η = ωt
ω is the wave frequency, and k = z0ω/c represents
the wavevector. The polarization of the wave will be
assumed ﬁxed though arbitrary. The magnitude of a,
a = eE/mcω (where E is the laser electric ﬁeld), can be
understood as the ratio of the momentum imparted by
the wave ﬁeld in a single oscillation to mc, meaning that
relativistic eﬀects become important at a & 1. (For the

In a certain, unique, frame of reference,

in such a
ﬁeld the particle undergoes stationary oscillatory “ﬁgure-
eight” motion in a linearly polarized wave or circular mo-
tion in a wave with circular polarization [3]. Averaging
over the oscillations, one comes to the concept of the
guiding center motion, which we study below. First, let
us consider the variational principle that states the min-

is left to be expressed in terms of the parameters of the
laser ﬁeld.

Let us calculate L0 in a laboratory frame of reference
where the particle has a nonzero average velocity υ0. In-
structive by itself, the derivation to follow will also pro-
vide us with a number of useful relations connecting the
parameters of the particle drift and those related to the

The guiding-center Lagrangian (5) with the expression
(14) for the eﬀective mass was also obtained in Ref. [9] by
a somewhat similar yet a complicated and not a straight-
forward procedure. In the cited work, Eq. (14) was sup-
posed valid only in the frame of reference where υ0 = 0.
In fact, as shown above, it remains applicable for arbi-
trary υ0, and, more than that, the actual value of meﬀ
must be relativistically invariant. To express the eﬀec-
tive mass in the invariant form, let us notice that, in the
laboratory frame where we chose the electric potential
φ = 0 (see Eq. (6)), √A2 coincides with the norm of
the 4-vector potential √AαAα, Aα = (φ, A). The latter
is Lorentz-invariant [3], and remains such after being av-
eraged over relativistically invariant phase η. Thus, the
expression for meﬀ , invariant to relativistic transforma-
tions, can be put in the following form:

meﬀ = mr1 +

Reverting to the formula for the drift Lagrangian (5)
with the eﬀective mass given by (14), the canonical mo-
mentum of the guiding center motion P 0 equals the

tion can be put in the form

Here meﬀ may smoothly depend on the guiding center
location R0 and time t if the wave envelope is slightly
nonuniform or time-dependent. Precisely, that means
that the laser intensity “seen” by the particle changes
insigniﬁcantly on one period of particle oscillations, so
that the averaging (7) still makes sense, i .e.

Ref. [11], where a sequence of canonical transformations

tedious procedure to be unnecessary for obtaining the
expression for the drift Hamiltonian. Comparing to the
cited work, the distinguishing advantage of the formula-
tion proposed in the present paper is that, because of
its apparent mathematical simplicity, this formulation
allows easy generalization of the drift Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian formalism on the case when the oscillating
particles undergo weak acceleration by large-scale low-
frequency forces satisfying (17). Interaction with these
forces enters the expression for L0 additively and, what
is most important, can still be considered in the frame-
work of the eﬀective mass concept.

To show this, consider an oscillating relativistic parti-
cle interacting with a ﬁeld governed by the 4-vector po-
tential Aα
bg = (φbg, Abg), where the subindex “bg” stands
for a background ﬁeld, additional to the one of the laser
wave. Assume that the ﬁeld is weak:

not impact the oscillatory motion signiﬁcantly. Thus,
averaging of the kinetic term mc2/γ in the Lagrangian
leads to the same expression as in Eq. (5) with meﬀ given
by Eq.
In the zeroth-order approximation with
respect to the small parameters (18), the average part
of the Lagrangian corresponding to particle interaction
with the background ﬁeld can be expressed in terms of
the quantity Aα

0 = (φ0, A0) given by

The time-averaging procedure is invariant with respect
to changing the drift frame of reference, i. e. does not
alter the Lorentz transformation properties of the quan-
tity being averaged. Thus, Aα

and can be considered as a new, eﬀective electromag-
netic ﬁeld.
In terms of this ﬁeld’s potentials, the drift

In certain applications, it is of interest to consider par-
ticle interaction with background ﬁelds having spatial
scale lbg . r∼. If the drift velocity is small, so that the
drift displacement on a single period υ0∆ is small com-
pared to lbg, the ponderomotive description still can be
applied. However, in this case the diﬀerence between the
0 and the true potential Aα
time-averaged potential Aα
bg
taken at the location of the guiding center R0, is crucial.

For example, this situation is realized at Coulomb scat-
tering in intense laser ﬁelds when r∼ exceeds the radius of
eﬀective interaction [13]. Note that, as follows from the
above analysis, the characteristic amplitude of the eﬀec-
tive potential remains unchanged as one generalizes the
expression for φ0 to the case of relativistic particle mo-
tion. In this case, the only diﬀerence in calculating φ0 is
provided through the change in the oscillatory trajectory
r∼(t) to be averaged over.

→

In the context of the Coulomb scattering problem, the
considered Lagrangian approach represents a unique tool
for studying ponderomotive and even stochastic behavior
of particles being scattered. This problem deserves de-
tailed consideration and will be discussed in future works,
though, brieﬂy, the extension of the proposed formula-
tion can be explained as follows. Stochastic behavior
of a dynamical system with periodic coeﬃcients is often
convenient to describe in terms of mapping of the dynam-
ical trajectory onto a subspace of the system phase space
(for review, see Ref. [14]). For the Hamiltonian mapping
(R0, P 0)
(R0, P 0) connecting the particle locations
and momenta before and after the time interval equal
to the period of the laser ﬁeld, the generating function is
given by the action (2) with t1 = t and t2 = t+2π/ω [14].
Since the obtained drift Lagrangian is approximately pro-
portional to S, it can readily be used for constructing
the actual form of this mapping. As will be shown in our
future publications, when studying the statistical prop-
erties of particle stochastic dynamics (rather than sin-
gle particle motion) by means of such a mapping, the
conditions (17) can be signiﬁcantly relaxed, which sub-
stantially broadens the proposed Lagrangian approach
applicability. That also allows a signiﬁcant progress in
studying the problem of energetic particle production in
strong laser ﬁelds [15].

Since, in the case of relativistic drift, r∼ depends on
υ0, the expression for the canonical momentum P 0 =
∂L0/∂υ0 the drift motion equations become complicated.
However, in two special cases of interest, those can be

(22) were also given in Ref. [8], though no strict deriva-
tion of those was proposed. Another expression for the
relativistic ponderomotive force is given in Ref. [9].

From Eq. (21), it follows that, in low-frequency large-
scale background ﬁeld, the guiding center of a relativistic
particle moving under the action of intense laser radiation
behaves as a particle with the eﬀective mass meﬀ drifting
in the same background ﬁeld. For example (and in co-
incidence with the results obtained in Ref. [8]), in static
magnetic ﬁeld Bbg, the guiding center undergoes Larmor
motion with the cyclotron frequency ωB = eBbg/γ0meﬀc.
Conventional expression for the drift velocity in nonuni-
form magnetic ﬁeld [3] also readily applies to the average
motion if the particle true mass is replaced with the one
given by Eq. (15).

In addition to the case of large-scale background ﬁelds,
the guiding center motion equations can also be put in
a simple, physically intuitive form in the case of nonrel-
ativistic drift motion. Since the drift velocity enters the
expression for Aα

slow drift motion superimposed on relativistic oscillations
is the one, which is actually realized in many current ex-
periments on intensive laser pulses interaction with rare
plasmas. (Under rare plasmas we assume those having
a refraction index close to unity, as assumed for all the
results obtained in the present paper.) This fact makes
the above analysis especially useful from the practical
point of view, as it represent a simple tool for studying
the actual experimental data. Finally, the well-known
nonrelativistic ponderomotive potential [4] can be read-
ily derived from Eq. (23) by keeping the correction to the
eﬀective mass, linear with respect to the wave intensity
(see also Ref. [9]).

In summary, we showed that, in weak low-frequency
background ﬁelds, relativistic particle moving under the
action of intense laser radiation drifts like a quasi-particle
with an eﬀective mass, which depends on the intensity of
the laser ﬁeld. The intuitive expectation that, by the
order of magnitude, the drift motion equations must co-
incide with those without the laser ﬁeld if the appropriate
relativistic correction of particle mass is introduced, can

now be considered proven for various types of background
ﬁelds. The proposed formulation can be useful for study-
ing numerous phenomena resulting from intense laser-
plasma interaction, such as, e. g., the energetic particle
production and Coulomb scattering in strong laser ﬁelds.
Moreover, the mathematical simplicity of the proposed
approach allows easy generalization of the rare plasma
hydrodynamics and electrodynamics to the case of plas-

mas illuminated by ultra-intense laser radiation. Replac-
ing the electron mass with the eﬀective mass (15), one
can readily derive the generalized dispersion relations for
various linear waves in plasmas, as well as revise the non-
linear plasma dynamics.

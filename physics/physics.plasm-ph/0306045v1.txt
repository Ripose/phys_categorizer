Direct numerical simulations of decaying and forced mag-
netohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence without and with mean
magnetic ﬁeld are analyzed by higher-order two-point statis-
tics. The turbulence exhibits statistical anisotropy with re-
spect to the direction of the local magnetic ﬁeld even in the
case of global isotropy. A mean magnetic ﬁeld reduces the
parallel-ﬁeld dynamics while in the perpendicular direction a
gradual transition towards two-dimensional MHD turbulence
is observed with k−3/2 inertial-range scaling of the perpen-
dicular energy spectrum. An intermittency model based on
the Log-Poisson approach, ζp = p/g2 + 1 − (1/g)p/g, is able
to describe the observed structure function scalings.

Turbulence is the natural state of many plasma ﬂows
observed throughout the universe, its statistical prop-
erties being essential for the theoretical understanding
of, e.g., star-forming regions in the interstellar medium,
the convection in planetary and stellar interiors, as well
as the dynamics of stellar winds. The solar wind, in
particular, represents the only source of in-situ measure-
ments, since laboratory experiments are far from generat-
ing fully-developed turbulence at high magnetic Reynolds
numbers. A simpliﬁed nonlinear model of turbulent plas-
mas is incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
[1]. In this framework the kinetic nature of microscopic
processes responsible for, e.g., energy dissipation, is ne-
glected when studying the ﬂuid-like macroscopic plasma
motions.

The spatial similarity of incompressible MHD turbu-
lence is usually investigated by considering two-point
statistics of the Els¨asser variables z± = v ± B [2] com-
bining velocity v and magnetic ﬁeld B (given in Alfv´en-
speed units). Restricting consideration to turbulence
with small cross helicity H C = RV dV(v · B), V being
the volume of the system, allows to set z+ ≃ z− = z.
With δzℓ = [z(r + ℓ) − z(r)] · ℓ/ℓ the longitudinal
isotropic structure functions of order p are deﬁned as
Sp(ℓ) = hδzp
ℓ i, the angular brackets denoting spatial av-
eraging. The structure functions exhibit self-similar scal-
ing Sp(ℓ) ∼ ℓζp in the inertial range where the dynamical
inﬂuence of dissipation, turbulence driving and system
boundaries is weak.

The inertial range has been introduced in Kol-
incompressible hy-

mogorov’s K41 phenomenology of

drodynamic turbulence [3,4] which assumes a spectral
energy-cascade driven by the break-up of turbulent ed-
dies. This leads to the experimentally well-veriﬁed
energy-spectrum E(k) ∼ k−5/3 [5] corresponding to ζ2 =
2/3. Iroshnikov and Kraichnan (IK) [6,7] included the
eﬀect of a magnetic ﬁeld by founding the energy-cascade
on the mutual scattering of Alfv´en waves triggered by ve-
locity ﬂuctuations. The IK picture phenomenologically
yields E(k) ∼ k−3/2, i.e., ζ2 = 1/2.

The validity of the two phenomenologies in MHD tur-
bulence is still under discussion. Two-dimensional direct
numerical simulations (DNS) support the IK picture [8,9]
while three-dimensional simulations exhibit K41 scaling
behavior [10]. Analytical results [11] also suggest ζ3 = 1,
consistent with K41 energy-spectra measured in the so-
lar wind [12]. A recent phenomenology of Goldreich and
Sridhar [13] postulates a balance between K41 and IK
energy cascades and accounts for the local anisotropy
induced by B. However, DNS which claim to support
this picture [14,15] suﬀer from moderate numerical res-
olution, making the identiﬁcation of self-similar scaling
ranges diﬃcult.

In this Letter we examine three-dimensional pseu-
dospectral DNS of decaying isotropic MHD turbulence
and of driven turbulent systems with mean magnetic
ﬁeld B0 at comparably high resolutions of up to 5123
collocation points. The structure functions are found to
be anisotropic with respect to the local magnetic ﬁeld.
The eﬀect increases with magnetic-ﬁeld strength, reduc-
ing the spatial intermittency of the turbulence in the
parallel-ﬁeld direction while rendering the system quasi-
two-dimensional perpendicular to B. An intermittency
model based on the Log-Poisson approach agrees well
with the observed structure-function scalings.

The simulations are performed by numerically solving

the incompressible MHD equations

∂tω − ∇ × (v × ω + j × B) = µν(−1)ν−1∆ν ω,

(1)

∂tB − ∇ × (v × B) = ην(−1)ν−1∆νB,

(2)

ω = ∇ × v,

j = ∇ × B, ∇ · v = ∇ · B = 0,

in a periodic cube with a pseudo-spectral method using
spherical mode-truncation to reduce aliasing eﬀects [16].
All simulations comprise about 9 eddy-turnover times,

1

a turnover time being deﬁned as the period required
to reach maximal energy dissipation when starting from
smooth ﬁelds. The initial conditions in the decaying case
are characterized by global equipartition of kinetic and
magnetic energy EK = EM = 0.5 with a spectral dis-
tribution ∼ exp(−k2/k2
0), k0 = 4, and random phases.
The driven runs start from a quasi-stationary state with
EK ≃ 0.75, EM ≃ 0.8 generated by forcing the system
for 24 turnover times. The forcing is realized by freezing
all modes in a sphere of radius kf = 2, allowing energy
transfer to higher wavenumbers by nonlinear interactions
only. The magnetic helicity in all simulations is ﬁnite,
H M = RV dV(A · B) ≈ 0.7H M
max with the magnetic vec-
tor potential A and H M
max ∼ EM/k0. For the driven cases
the B0-component which renders H M gauge-dependent
has been subtracted and k0 ≃ kf . The cross helicity H C is
approximately zero in the decaying system and ≃ 0.12 for
the driven runs, mildly ﬂuctuating around the respective
value. The generalized magnetic Prandtl number µν/ην
is equal to unity with hyperdiﬀusive dissipation opera-
tors ν = 2, µ2 = η2 = 3 × 10−8. Test runs with ν = 1
show no notable diﬀerence in the reported results.

Weak-turbulence theory [17] and numerical simula-
tions [18–20] show that the IK cascade is spatially
anisotropic, the underlying three-wave interactions dis-
tributing energy predominantly perpendicular to B. The
associated spectral dependence on a mean magnetic ﬁeld
has been studied numerically as well as in the reduced-
MHD framework ( [21] and references therein) while sta-
tistical anisotropy has been found in the second-order
structure functions of MHD turbulence [22]. In order to
assess this anisotropy by higher-order statistics, paral-
lel and perpendicular structure functions are calculated
with ﬁeld increments, δzℓ, taken in the corresponding di-
rections with respect to the local magnetic ﬁeld. This
is in contrast to isotropic structure functions where the
δzℓ are measured without preferred direction. The lo-
cal magnetic ﬁeld on the increment length-scale, deﬁning
ﬁeld-parallel and ﬁeld-perpendicular directions at each
spatial co-ordinate, is found by applying a top-hat ﬁl-
ter of width ℓ, i.e., by multiplying B with the Fourier-
space ﬁlter kernel Gℓ(k) = sin(kℓ/2)/(kℓ/2). The ob-
tained structure functions, computed using |δzℓ| to avoid
cancelation eﬀects, exhibit inertial-range scaling with ex-
ponents ζp which can be determined up to order p = 8 by
a saddle-point in the logarithmic derivative. The results
have been cross-checked using the extended self-similarity
property [23] of the data.

Fig. 1 shows that the decaying system with B0 = 0
(5123 collocation points) is statistically anisotropic. The
ﬁeld-perpendicular scalings display increased intermit-
tency compared to the isotropic structure functions. As-
suming that the formation of intermittent structures pri-
marily depends on the turbulent energy available at the
corresponding spatial scales, the observation is consistent
with both the IK and the K41 cascade being strongest

perpendicular to B. The former due to the inherent
anisotropy of Alfv´en-wave scattering, the latter because
ﬁeld lines resist bending but can be shuﬄed easily by ed-
dies perpendicular to the local ﬁeld. Consequently, the
ﬁeld-parallel energy transfer is depleted leading to less
intermittent parallel scalings.

The dependence of

statistical anisotropy on the
magnetic-ﬁeld strength is examined in forced-turbulence
simulations with mean magnetic ﬁeld (B0 = 5,10) allow-
ing a reduction of numerical resolution in the mean-ﬁeld
direction to respectively 256 and 128 collocation points
(cf. Fig. 2). The quasi-stationary forced systems as-
sume constant energy ratios of mean ﬁeld to turbulent
ﬂuctuations. The parallel scalings shown in Fig. 1 dis-
play decreasing intermittency with raising B0, i.e., an
asymptotic approach towards a straight line. Referring
to Kolmogorov’s reﬁned-similarity hypotheses [24], this is
equivalent to higher parallel-ﬁeld homogeneity of small-
i.e., current and vorticity
scale dissipative structures,
micro-sheets, due to their stronger alignment along B0.
The perpendicular statistics (Fig. 1) become increasingly
two-dimensional, getting close to values found in DNS
of two-dimensional MHD turbulence (The exponents for
B0 = 10 and those obtained from 2D-DNS [9] coincide
within the error-margin.). The asymptotic state results
from micro-sheet alignment along B0 which decreases the
spatial extent of the sheets in the ﬁeld-perpendicular di-
rection to quasi-one-dimensional dissipative ribbons.

The ζ2-exponents are related to the inertial-range
scaling of the one-dimensional energy spectra Ek =
1/2 R dk1 R dk2(|vk|2 + |Bk|2) with k1, k2 spanning
planes perpendicular to the component of k associated
with the spatial increment ℓ. For the ﬁeld-parallel and
k ∼ k−(1+ζk,⊥
ﬁeld-perpendicular spectra this gives Ek,⊥
).

k -scaling changes from K41, ∼ k−5/3, to IK,
while the E⊥
∼ k−3/2, with increasing B0. This agrees with DNS of
two-dimensional MHD turbulence and suggests that, con-
trary to the three-dimensional case where K41 scaling is
observed, the restriction to a quasi-two-dimensional ge-
ometry increases the importance of the inherently two-
dimensional Alfv´en-wave cascade (IK) compared to the
eddy-breakup process (K41).

B0-axis are given for B0 = 0, 5, 10. The spectra are
time-averaged over 4 eddy turnover-times and normalized
in amplitude assuming a K41 dependence on the mean
energy-dissipation ε = − ˙E as ∼ ε2/3. Wavenumbers are
normalized with the generalized K41 dissipation-length
ℓD = (µ3/ε)1/(6ν−2). The normalization, though unnec-
essary for the driven runs, allows comparison with the de-
caying case shown in the inset in Fig. 2. For B0 = 0 the
parallel and perpendicular energy spectra diﬀer slightly
at largest scales where the few involved Fourier modes
do not isotropize perfectly. The inertial range exhibits

K41 scaling which leads to a clear deviation from the
horizontal under the applied k3/2 compensation. For ﬁ-
nite B0 the spectra display a marked anisotropy in agree-
ment with the perpendicular and parallel structure func-
tions. With growing B0 the E⊥
k asymptotically follow
IK scaling while the Ek
k indicate an increasing depletion
of small-scale turbulence. The ﬁeld-parallel damping re-
sults from the stiﬀness of magnetic ﬁeld lines in agree-
ment with the picture of ﬁeld-aligned dissipative struc-
tures. This corresponds to an increase of the associated
dissipation length [25]. The diﬀerent amplitudes of Ek
k
and E⊥
∼ 0.02 have been
found similarly in shell-model calculations of anisotropic
MHD turbulence [26] resulting from an equilibrium be-
tween ﬁeld-perpendicular and isotropic energy cascades.
Intermittency, the departure of turbulence from strict
spatial self-similarity, leads to ‘anomalous’ non-linear be-
havior of the ζp. The Log-Poisson intermittency model
[27] reproduces these experimental and numerical ﬁnd-
ings in hydrodynamic and MHD turbulence very well.
Its generic form ζp = (1 − x)p/g + C0(1 − [1 − x/C0]p/g)
[28,29] depends on the codimension C0 of the most sin-
gular dissipative structures (in three-dimensions C0 = 2
for ﬁlaments, C0 = 1 for micro-sheets), the scale depen-
dence of dissipation in these structures ε(∞)
ℓ ∼ ℓ−x and
the phenomenological non-intermittent scaling δzℓ ∼ ℓ1/g
(g = 3 for K41, g = 4 for IK). Usually, x and g are
linked by assuming equal scaling of the timescale t∞
ℓ of
ε(∞)
ℓ and the nonlinear transfer time tNL
of

the energy cascade ε ∼ δz2
ℓ /tNL
yielding x = 2/g. Here,

E∞ denotes the amount of energy dissipated in the most
singular structures. The successful hydrodynamic She-
L´evˆeque formula [27] results from C0 = 2, g = 3 while
isotropic structure-function scalings in DNS of three-
dimensional MHD turbulence are well reproduced with
C0 = 1, g = 3 [30].

To model statistical anisotropy we extend the ap-

Fig. 3 shows the predictions of Eq. (3) with the corre-
sponding numerical values of g. The isotropic MHD in-
termittency model based on K41 scaling [30] is denoted
by the solid line in Figs. 1 and 3. For increasing B0 the
limiting value of g in the parallel direction is 1, stand-
ing for spatially homogeneous dissipation. The asymp-
totic perpendicular exponents should be reproduced by
g = 4 to be consistent with the IK scaling observed in this
work and in DNS of two-dimensional MHD turbulence.
The fact that the observed perpendicular exponents for
B0 = 10 correspond to the model with g ≈ 4.4 can be

ascribed to the simplicity of the approach which never-
theless captures the basic physics of the system.

the strengths of ﬁeld-

ciency is controlled by the factor (ℓ/ℓ0)χ in tNL
, lumping
together deviations of the physical transfer-process from
the K41 picture and diﬀerences in the amount of cascad-
ing energy compared to the isotropic case. For example,
the model indicates a growing ﬁeld-perpendicular cas-
cade with increasing B0 though scalings suggest a transi-
tion from K41 to the less eﬃcient IK cascade mechanism.
This eﬃciency reduction is, however, over-compensated
by the increase of energy cascading ﬁeld-perpendicularly
compared to the isotropic situation. The model repro-
duces the numerical data very well and in agreement
with the physical interpretation suggested above. With
increasing B0 a larger fraction of energy compared to the
isotropic case (B0 = 0) is spectrally transferred perpen-
dicular to the magnetic ﬁeld while the cascade becomes
successively damped in the parallel-ﬁeld direction.

ℓ

In summary, we have analyzed DNS of decaying and
forced MHD turbulence without and with varying mean
magnetic ﬁeld using higher-order statistics. Globally
isotropic turbulence exhibits statistical anisotropy, at-
tributed to the inﬂuence of the local magnetic ﬁeld on the
nonlinear energy cascade. An increasing mean magnetic-
ﬁeld B0 damps the parallel-ﬁeld dynamics while in the
perpendicular direction a gradual transition towards two-
dimensional MHD turbulence is observed with perpendic-
ular energy-spectra showing IK scaling. A modiﬁed Log-
Poisson intermittency model reproduces the statistical
anisotropy by phenomenological tuning of the respective
energy cascades. The anisotropic approach of Goldreich
and Sridhar, therefore, seems to be a promising concept
though the proposed realizations for weak, ‘intermediate’
and ‘strong’ turbulence remain questionable.

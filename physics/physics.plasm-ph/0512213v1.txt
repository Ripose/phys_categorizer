Abstract

The classical Debye-H¨uckel screening eﬀect of the electrostatic ﬁeld generated by isolated charged

particles immersed in a plasma is reviewed. The validity of the underlying mathematical model,

and particularly of the weak-ﬁeld approximation, are analyzed. It is shown that the presence of

the plasma sheath around test particles and the resulting eﬀect of charge screening are essential

for the description of plasmas which are strongly coupled.

INTRODUCTION

In this work we intend to analyze the consistency of the traditional mathematical model

for the so-called Debye screening problem (DSP) originally formulated by Debye and H¨uckel

(DH model [1]). In particular, we intend to prove that the 3D Poisson equation involved

in the DH model does not admit physically acceptable solutions, i.e., solutions which are

provided by ordinary functions and are at least continuous in the domain of existence, i.e.,

are so-called classical (or strong) solutions. For this purpose a modiﬁed model is proposed

which takes into account the eﬀect of local plasma sheath (i.e., the local domain near test

particles where the plasma must be considered discrete). Basic consequences of the model

are discussed, which concern the asymptotic properties of the solutions determined both

for weakly and strongly-coupled plasmas. As an application the charge screening eﬀect in

strongly-coupled plasmas is investigated and an explicit expression of the eﬀective charge

for the asymptotic DH potential is determined. An ubiquitous property of plasmas, either

quasi-neutral or non-neutral and weakly or strongly-coupled, is the so-called Debye shielding

of the electrostatic potential. This is generated by a single charged particle (test particle) of

the plasma, located at position r(t) and belonging to the N-body system (with N ≫ 1) of

charged particles forming a plasma, or more generally by a ﬁnite collection of test particles

(with positions ri(t), i = 1, Nt, possibly with Nt ≪ N). The test particle and the plasma

are both assumed non-relativistic when referred to a suitable Galileian reference frame,

i.e., deﬁned in such a way that |V| /c ≪ 1,

·r(t)

/c ≪ 1, V and ·r(t) being respectively

(cid:12)
the ﬂuid velocity of the plasma and the test particle velocity ·r(t), both to be assumed
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
generally non-vanishing. It is well-known that this phenomenon occurs, in particular, if the

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

plasma is assumed suitably close to kinetic equilibrium, namely if each particle species (s)

is described by a Maxwellian kinetic distribution function (fM s), carrying a ﬁnite number

density Ns,temperature Ts and ﬂow velocity V. Here, Ts, V and Ns (the latter only in the

absence of test particles) must result constant or at least, in a suitable sense slowly dependent

with respect to position (r) and time (t). As a consequence, suﬃciently far from each test

particle, in a sense to be deﬁned, the Coulomb electrostatic potential results eﬀectively

screened and decays exponentially on a characteristic scale speciﬁed by the Debye length

(λD;see below). Of course, this phenomenology applies only provided local perturbations

of the kinetic distribution function are suitably small.

In such a case, due to spherical

2

symmetry of the test particle, the screened potential must result manifestly function only of

the distance ρ = |r − r(t)| between the point of measurement rand the position of the test

particle r(t). In addition, if both the test particle and the plasma are non-relativistic, the

potential must be also independent of the velocity of the test particle ·r(t). This is the subject

of the so-called Debye screening problem, which regards the determination of the electrostatic

potential generated by test particles in a quasi-neutral plasma. The mathematical model of

DSP in his original formulation [1] (recalled in detail below, see Sec.2) concerns point-like

test particles and is based both the neglect of the local plasma sheath around each test

particle (or the ﬁnite size of the test particles, for example in the case of large-size dusty

particles) and on the so-called weak-ﬁeld approximation. The ﬁrst assumption, concerns the

neglect of the screening eﬀect produced by the presence of discrete interactions close to the

test particles (local plasma sheath). This set is generally species-dependent and is deﬁned

as the sphere R
{

ρos

}

= {ρ : 0 ≤ ρ < ρos, ρ ≡ |r − r(t)| ∈+} , of radius ρos and centered at the

position of the test particle, r(t), in which the species sof the plasma must be treated as a

discrete system; instead, for any distance ρ ≥ ρos the species s is assumed to be described

in terms of a continuous kinetic distribution function. The second approximation, which

permits the linearization of the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential, is based

on the requirement that, for arbitrary ρ ≡ |r − r(t)| ∈+, the following asymptotic ordering

holds

Φ(ρ) ∼ O(ε) ≪ 1,

being ε an inﬁnitesimal and

Φ = |eΦ| /Te the normalized electrostatic potential and Te the

deﬁned in the absence of test particles (i.e., letting

Despite previous attempts to construct approximate or exact solutions to the DH model

b

[8, 9, 10], the related mathematical model appears incomplete and can be shown to be phys-

ically unacceptable, due to the neglect of the local plasma sheath. In fact, it is obvious that

suﬃciently close to the point-particle the weak-ﬁeld approximation (1) is violated making

the DH model invalid. In the past [3] it was pointed out that in such a case the test particle

does not produce any electric ﬁeld, but only complete charge neutralization by the plasma,

thus producing a Debye length which eﬀectively vanishes. Other objections concerned the

asserted indeterminacy of the solution for x = 0 due to its divergence in the same point

[6]. These issues were later addressed in a more general context [4], including the 2D case

where complete neutralization cannot be achieved. To recover the correct physical picture

the eﬀect of local plasma sheath must be included. Nevertheless, for suitably dense plasmas

or in the case of plasma species characterized by very high electric charges (high-Z), such

as dusty plasmas, the weak-ﬁeld approximation may be locally violated. This circumstance,

when the eﬀect of ﬁnite local plasma sheath is included, occurs if the normalized electro-

static potential

Φ(ρ) results of order unit or larger on the boundary of the plasma sheath

(produced by at least one of the s plasma species), namely for ρ = ρos. Such a condition

b

can be expressed in terms of the Coulomb coupling parameter Γks,

i.e., by the requirement

that for a test particle of species k there results at least for a species s

and xos = ρos/λD, denote respectively the dimensionless electric charge carried

(cid:16)
by a test particle of species k and the radius of the s − th species plasma sheath surrounding

(cid:17)

the test particle. We stress that, ordinarily, in plasmas the asymptotic condition xos ≪ 1 has

also to be imposed on each particle species s. For example, in a space dusty plasma typical

values for dust grain charges, plasma temperature and plasma density are Zd ∼ 104 ÷ 105,
3. In this case the Coulomb parameter for a negatively-charged

However, in principle, in a dusty plasma the plasma Debye length can also become signiﬁ-

cantly smaller than in the corresponding ”clean” plasma (i.e., before injection of the dusty

species), which may inﬂuence, i.e., increasing, the values of Γdi and xoi. Further important

aspects of DSP concern the investigation of possible charge screening eﬀects, namely the

reduction to the eﬀective charge c with respect to the asymptotic value characterizing the

weak-ﬁeld approximation (3) of the DH potential (2). These eﬀects, produced by non-linear

contributions in the Poisson equation, while usually negligible for weakly coupled plasmas,

are known to be signiﬁcant in strongly-coupled plasmas [5], such as dusty plasmas [11, 15].

Indeed the investigation of the eﬀective interactions chracterizing high-Z grains in plasmas

has attracted interest in recent years especially for numerical simulations (see, for exam-

ple, [12, 14, 16]). However, analytic estimates of the eﬀective charge characterizing the DH

potential in strongly-coupled plasmas are still not available.

Goal of this work is the analysis of DSP and the deﬁnition of a suitably modiﬁed math-

ematical model to take into account the eﬀect of local plasma sheaths in quasi-neutral

plasmas. In particular, in Sec. 2 the traditional DH model is recalled, while the new model

is presented in Sec.3. In the same section the basic mathematical results are given which

concern the asymptotic properties of the solutions obtained in the limit of vanishing sheath

radii (ρos → 0+). We intend to prove that the Poisson equation characterizing the DH

model (here denoted Debye-Poisson equation) can be considered as a limit equation ob-

tained from a suitably modiﬁed formulation of DSP. The latter is obtained by including the

eﬀect of ﬁnite local plasma sheaths (i.e., requiring xos > 0, for all species). Basis feature of

the present approach is the representation of the Poisson equation in integral form. This

permits to analyze the asymptotic properties of the solutions of the modiﬁed problem in the

limit xos → 0+. It is found, that the limit solution of the modiﬁed DSP for xos → 0+ is a

distribution which vanishes identically for all ρ > 0 and is discontinuous in ρ = 0. It is found

(see THM.1 in Sec.3) that in this limit the solution of the modiﬁed DSP results uniquely

determined as a function of the normalized charge carried by the test particle (β) and is

represented by a well-deﬁned distribution. Precisely it follows that (see THM.1 in Sec.3)

while one can prove that the limit function limxo

Φxo(x) ≡

Φ(x) reads (see THM.3 in

Hence,obviously, the limit function

Φ(x) is not an strong solution of the DP equation. This

is therefore a characteristic property of the DH model. In particular, as a basic consequence,

b

the eﬀective charge of the DH asymptotic solution c vanishes identically in such a limit and

results independent of the charge of the test particle.

As a further development, we intend to investigate strongly-coupled plasmas (Sec.4 and

5), for which there results for a test particle of species k (for example to be identiﬁed with

a dusty grain)

(strong coupling ordering) where k = 0, 1 and δ is an inﬁnitesimal. The asymptotic solutions

of the modiﬁed DSP are here determined explicitly for the external and internal asymptotic

solutions. The former, which are valid outside the Debye sphere (i.e., in the domain x > 1,

or x ≫ 1) coincides with the customary DH potential. The latter instead, which occurs

inside the Debye sphere near the boundary of the local plasma sheath, describes the non-

linear eﬀects due to the screening generated by plasma species having opposite charge with

respect to that of the test particle.

In addition, in Sec.4 also the asymptotic solution of

the modiﬁed DSP close to the boundary of the local plasma sheath (i.e., for ∆x = x − xos

inﬁnitesimal) is constructed. It is proven that the asymptotic solution can be determined

uniquely, together with its internal boundary conditions (deﬁned on the boundary of the

plasma sheath, i.e., for x = xos). Finally, by comparing the internal and external asymptotic

solutions for a test particle in a strongly-coupled plasma, an ”asymptotic” upper bound is

obtained (Sec.5) for the eﬀective charge characterizing the DH potential. As a result, it is

found that in strongly-coupled plasmas the eﬀective charge of highly-charged test particles,

which characterizes the DH asymptotic solution, results strongly reduced with respect the

6

value of the isolated test particle (charge screening eﬀect). The result appears potentially

relevant especially for strongly-coupled dusty plasmas, since the charge screening eﬀect can

dramatically reduce the DH potential, particularly for highly charged test particles.

II. THE DEBYE-H ¨UCKEL MODEL AND THE DSP PROBLEM

The traditional formulation of the DSP, based on the Debye-H¨uckel model [1] regards

the test particles as point-like and having a spherically-symmetric charge distribution while

ignoring the eﬀect of local plasma sheath. This implies, from the physical standpoint,

to neglect the discrete nature of the plasma. As a consequence the background plasma

is treated as a continuum medium formed potentially by several particle species, each

described by a Maxwellian kinetic distribution, so that its total charge density results

ρp =

,where the constraint

ZseNos = 0 must be imposed for

quasi-neutral plasma. Here the summation is performed on all particle species of the plasma,

Furthermore, the charge density of the test particles is manifestly ρn =

the summation is carried out on the collection of all test particles. In the remainder we shall

assume, without loss of generality, for all test charges qi > 0. Hence, in terms of dimen-

III. CONSISTENCY OF THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL - THE MODIFIED DSP

In this section we deﬁne the modiﬁed Debye screening problem (modiﬁed DSP), based on

the introduction of a simple model of local plasma sheath. In the sequel we shall consider for

simplicity of notation the case of a two species-plasma, formed by electrons and Hydrogen

ions, having an unique plasma sheath. However, the generalization to multispecies plasma

is straightforward. Thus, for a test particle we shall assume that the plasma sheath is

represented by a spherical domain of radius ρo, centered at the location of the test particle,

in which the plasma charge density is negligible. In addition, for simplicity, inside the plasma

sheath the charge distribution will be regarded as uniform. The same model can also apply

to ﬁnite-size test particles. In such a case, the customary DH model is obviously recovered

in the limit in which ρo → 0 (or in dimensionless variables, xo ≡ ρo/λD → 0). Denoting

Φxo(x) the solution of the corresponding Poisson equation, here we intend to determine its
asymptotic properties in the limit xo → 0+ (see THM.1). In particular, in agreement with

which is in electrostatic equilibrium and is immersed in a spatially uniform quasi-neutral and

Maxwellian plasma. As for the previous DP equation, it follows that, for solutions satisfying

The basic implication of THM.1 and 2 is that the DP equation (11), provided by the

DH model, must be regarded as physically unacceptable, since it does not admit strong

solutions. In this regard it should be noted that, as a basic principle, physically acceptable

of solutions of ordinary (or partial) diﬀerential equations characterizing the classical theory

of ﬁelds must be suitably smooth strong solutions. The modiﬁed Debye screening problem

here deﬁned, instead, exhibits smooth strong solutions and therefore appears, from this

viewpoint, consistent.

INTERNAL ASYMPTOTIC SOLUTION OF THE MODIFIED DSP

In this section we intend to construct explicitly the internal asymptotic solution of the

modiﬁed DSP problem, deﬁned by (19),(20), (21),(22), in the case of strongly-coupled plas-

mas, for which the asymptotic ordering deﬁned by the inequalities (9),(10) applies.

In

particular, we shall consider a suitable neighborhood of the boundary of the plasma sheath

(xo), characterized by an inﬁnitesimal amplitude ∆x = x − xo deﬁned so that

0 ≤ ∆x ≪

ﬁnitesimal dimensionless parameter δ and with respect to ∆x.These will be denoted as

internal asymptotic solution of the modiﬁed DSP. We intend to prove, as a consequence,

that in the neighborhood of xo deﬁned by (41) the internal asymptotic solution can be

uniquely determined, to leading order in the relevant asymptotic parameter. In fact, the

following theorem holds.

A. THEOREM 3 - Internal asymptotic solution for strongly-coupled plasma

In validity of the asymptotic ordering of strongly-coupled plasma [see inequalities (9),(10)]

and in the neighborhood of xo deﬁned by the inequalities (41), the asymptotic solution of

the modiﬁed DSP [(19),(20), (21),(22)] reads

Φxo(x) ∼=

As a consequence, it is immediate to prove that y(x, xo) for arbitrary x, xo > 0 (x ≥ xo)

Here F (x, xo) is the solution of the integral equation

(cid:27)

while S(y(x′, xo)) is deﬁned by the r.h.s. of Eq.(46). Furthermore, a direct evaluation of the

explicit integral in Eq.(54) permits to cast F (x, xo) in the form

where Fo(x, xo) and G1(x′, xo) are respectively

Fo(x, xo) =

dx′ (x − x′)

(58)

Using Eqs.(55), (57) and (58) it is immediate to prove that y(x, xo) satisﬁes also the

boundary conditions (48),(50) and (51) and in particular that the limit (49) is actually

satisﬁed. The proof follows by noting that, in the strong-coupling ordering (9),(10) and for

0 < (x − xo) ∼ O(δ0), the dominant contribution in y(x, xo) is negative and is provided by

the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq.(57). This implies that an asymptotic approximation

for y(x, xo) is provided in this case by:

y(x, xo) ∼= y(int)(x, xo) = −α(x − xo) + Fo(x, xo),

(59)

and consequently also Eq.(43). Manifestly y(int)(x, xo) satisﬁes identically all the boundary

conditions (48), (49), (50) and (51). Finally, to determine the initial condition

Φxo(xo) ≡

Φo,

it is suﬃcient to notice that in asymptotic orderings (9),(10) and (41) the following identity

which to leading order in δ implies Eq.(44). To brieﬂy comment these results, it is important

to remark, that, by assumption, the internal asymptotic solution here obtained, (59), is

valid if the parameter xo results of order O(1) or is inﬁnitesimal in δ [see the ordering (10)],
while the parameter Γ satisﬁes (9). As a consequence, in the limit xo → 0+ Eq.(60) results

consistent with Eq.(7), thus proving also the validity of Eq.(6). Finally, we notice that the

sub-domain (41) in which the internal asymptotic solution (59) is valid, allows

Φxo(x) ≪ 1.

This is also consistent with the weak-ﬁeld approximation (1).

V. CONCLUSIONS: ASYMPTOTIC UPPER BOUND FOR THE EFFECTIVE

CHARGE

As an important application, the previous analytic results can be used to obtain an

asymptotic estimate for the eﬀective dimensionless charge c(xo, Γ) carried by the DH poten-

15

tial in strongly-coupled plasmas. We intend to show that test particles which have a high

charge undergo a strong charge screening eﬀect, close to the local plasma sheath, produced

by non-linear eﬀects in the Poisson equation. As a consequence, outside the Debye sphere

(i.e., for x > 1) the DH potential generated by highly charged test particles in strongly-

coupled plasmas results strongly reduced with respect to the theoretical value observed in

the corresponding weakly-coupled systems.

The eﬀective charge of the test particle can be estimated by comparing the internal and

external asymptotic solutions in a suitable neighborhood of the boundary of the plasma

sheath (i.e., near x = xo), belonging to the sub-domain deﬁned by (41). For this purpose

we impose the matching condition

where, by assumption, xC is deﬁned so that there results

Φxo(xC) ≪ 1 and moreover

being ∆xc ≡ xc − xo and where

≫ 1, consistent with the assumption of strongly-

coupled plasma (9),(10).The matching condition can be used to obtain an upper estimate

for c(xo, Γ). In fact, in validity of the ordering Eq.(63),

(xC) can be approximated

. Then, ignoring higher order corrections in δ, the

which delivers therefore an asymptotic upper bound for the eﬀective charge c(xo, Γ).
particular, it follows that c(a)((xo, Γ) depends logarithmically on the normalized charge of

In

the isolated test particle β. Thus, in general for strongly-coupled plasmas the eﬀective

dimensionless charge appears much smaller than in weakly-coupled plasmas. The result can

be signiﬁcant for the investigation of dusty plasmas, particularly to describe the charge

screening eﬀect of highly charged dusty grains. Comparisons with numerical simulations,

based on the numerical solution of modiﬁed DSP [deﬁned by Eqs. (19),(20) and the boundary

conditions (21),(22)], indicate that the asymptotic estimate c(a)((xo, Γ) holds already for

β & 1 and xo . 0.3. For numerical calculations, the eﬀective charge c(xo, Γ) has been

16

determined numerically as the limit for x ≫ 1 (i.e., x → ∞) of the the function

(65)

where

Φxo(x) denotes the numerical solution of the modiﬁed DSP. As previously discovered

[5], it is found that for strongly-coupled plasmas (i.e., assuming Γ > 1) fc(x) approaches

b

rapidly the asymptotic value c(xo, Γ), even at a ”distance” x smaller than the Debye Length

(i.e., for x < 1). For reference in ﬁgs 1-3 the numerical estimates of fc(x), c(xo, Γ) and
c(a)((xo, Γ) have been reported for the cases β = 1, 5, 10 and xo = 0.05 ÷ 0.3. Its is found
that the upper bound c(a)((xo, Γ) provided by the majorization (64) can actually be used to

obtain an approximate estimate of the eﬀective charge c(xo, Γ).

Finally, it is worthwhile pointing out that the asymptotic estimate provided by c(a)((xo, Γ)

satisﬁes also the correct limit set by THM.1. In fact the it results

and this limit is satisﬁed even in the case in which Γ ∼ 1/δ ∼ 1/xo.

Abstract

Exact solutions of the steady resistive three dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)

equations in cylindrical coordinates for an incompressible plasma are presented. The solutions are

translationally invariant along one direction and in general they describe a process of reconnective

annihilation in a curved current layer with non vanishing magnetic ﬁeld.

In the derivation of

the solutions the ideal case with vanishing resistivity and electric ﬁeld is considered ﬁrst and then

generalized to include the eﬀects of ﬁnite electric ﬁeld and resistivity. Particular attention is devoted

to the analysis how the latter ones inﬂuence the presence of singularities in the solutions. In this

respect comparisons with the purely two-dimensional case are made and the resulting important

diﬀerences are highlighted. Finally, applications of the solutions for modeling an important class

of solar ﬂares are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic reconnection is an eﬀective mechanism for restructuring the magnetic ﬁeld and

converting magnetic energy into other forms of energy in plasmas with a high electric con-

ductivity. This process plays a key role in large scale cosmic phenomena such as solar

ﬂares and geomagnetic substorms. Since the pioneering works of Dungey1, Parker2, Sweet3

and Petschek4, where the basic physics of magnetic reconnection was clariﬁed, many ex-

act two-dimensional (2D) solutions describing some simpliﬁed versions of this process were

found5,6,7,8.

Moreover, over the last few years there was a similar progress in the theory of three-

dimensional (3D) reconnection. In particular, some simpliﬁed forms of this process at null

points of 3D magnetic ﬁelds have been found as well9,10,11.

In this paper we present a generalization of exact solutions for a 2D curvilinear geometry8,

the so-called two and a half dimensions (2 1

2D) case, where a translational invariant compo-
nent of velocity and magnetic ﬁeld along the third direction exists. These solutions describe

steady incompressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) ﬂows in a conﬁguration with

non-vanishing magnetic ﬁeld. In some respects they resemble the 2D solutions describing a

particular type of magnetic reconnection which is called reconnective annihilation7. So we

will also use this term further on to denote the process described by our solutions.

It should be noted also that when the present article was in preparation, a paper of

Watson and Craig12 appeared, where similar solutions have been presented. Since we found

these solutions independently, our considerations and interpretations diﬀer in many respects.

In sections II and III, respectively, the basic equations and the form of solutions are

described. In section IV we derive the solutions in the limit of ideal MHD and discuss their

properties, while in section V we consider how these solutions are modiﬁed in the case of

non-vanishing resistivity. The conclusions are drawn in section VI.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

The set of MHD equations for an incompressible plasma with uniform density and resis-

tivity consists of the equation of motion

(v · ∇)v = −∇p + (∇ × B) × B,

(1)

2

the Ohm’s law

and the divergence-free conditions for the velocity v and the magnetic ﬁeld B

E + v × B = η∇ × B

∇ · v = 0,

∇ · B = 0.

All equations here are written in a dimensionless form such that B and v are normalized

to Be and vAe respectively, which are characteristic values of the magnetic ﬁeld and of the

Alfv´en velocity. E represents the dimensionless electric ﬁeld while η corresponds to the

inverse magnetic Reynolds number.

The current density j is determined separately by Amp`ere’s law

j = ∇ × B.

Consider a cylindrical coordinate system (r, θ, z) where r and θ are related to the Cartesian

coordinates (x, y) in the following way

x = r sin θ,

y = r cos θ − d,

where d > 0 so that the pole is below the plane y = 0. Assume that in this coordinate

system the functions B and v depend only on r and θ. Then they can be written as follows

(Br, Bθ, Bz) =

where A, H, ψ and V are functions of r and θ which are to be found. In particular, for

H = V = 0 this is the usual representation of two-dimensional magnetic and incompressible

velocity ﬁelds in terms of a ﬂux function A and a stream function ψ, respectively.

By using this representation we obtain from Eq. (1) that the functions A, H, ψ and V

must satisfy the following two equations

Similarly, Eq. (2) gives the following two equations

[H, ψ] + [A, V ] = ηr∇2H,

Ezr + [ψ, A] = −ηr∇2A.

III. FORM OF THE SOLUTIONS

For the system (7)–(10) we seek solutions of the form

A(r, θ) = A1(r)θ + A0(r),

ψ(r, θ) = ψ1(r)θ + ψ0(r),

H(r, θ) = H1(r)θ + H0(r),

V (r, θ) = V1(r)θ + V0(r).

This form is a generalization of the ansatz used in Ref. 8 for a two-dimensional conﬁguration.

Substituting (11) into (7)–(10) provides four equations each of which is a polynomial linear in

θ. Thus for each equation the part of the polynomial not depending on θ and the coeﬃcient

of θ must be separately equal to 0. This yields the following set of ordinary diﬀerential

equations (ODEs):

Here the prime stands for the derivative with respect to r. The above system consists of

8 ODEs for 8 unknowns of one variable. Therefore the ansatz (11) is compatible with the

original system of partial diﬀerential equations. In our stationary case ∇ × E = 0, which

together with Eq. (11) yields a uniform z-component of the electric ﬁeld.

One can also notice that Eqs. (14), (15), (18) and (19) are the same as for the purely

two-dimensional (2D) case corresponding to setting H ≡ V ≡ 0. Thus, the 2D equations are

a limiting case of our 2 1

2 D case and, what is even more important, they are decoupled from
the rest equations of the system. Solutions of Eq. (14), (15), (18) and (19) have already

been presented in Ref. 12 and we can simply use these solutions for solving our more general

problem. It is worth noticing that, for known A1, A0

, ψ1 and ψ0

, the system of equations

(12), (13), (16) and (17) is linear in the functions H1, H0

IV.

IDEAL SOLUTIONS

In this section Eqs. (12)–(19) are analyzed in the limit of vanishing resistivity η = 0.

We start by considering the equipotential case, i.e. the case where the electric potential

is constant along the z axis so that Ez vanishes as well.

In this case, according to (10),

[ψ, A] = 0 and (11) the relationship

ψ = αA,

α = constant

is valid. Eqs. (14), (15), (18) and (19) then yield

A1 = C1 ln r + C2,

ψ1 = αA1,

A0 = C3r2 + C4 ln r,

ψ0 = αA0,

(20)

(21)

(22)

where C1, C2, C3 and C4 are arbitrary constants. These solutions describe a magnetic

conﬁguration with a ﬁeld-aligned ﬂow in the (r, θ) plane.

In this conﬁguration there are

C4)/C1]. Here rc ≡ exp(−C2/C1) is denoted as a critical radius.

It is not diﬃcult to see now that Eqs. (12) and (17) can be satisﬁed in the ideal limit by

V1 = c1A1,

H1 = c2A1,

(23)

where c1 and c2 are other arbitrary constants. Therefore V1 and H1 also vanish together

with A1 and ψ1 at rc. Then the evaluation of (13) at rc requires C ≡ 0. Substituting of (23)

into (13) and (17) yields

which in general do not vanish. Therefore, contrary to the 2D case, in 2 1

2D we generally

have neither nulls nor stagnation points in the limit Ez = η = 0.

The velocity and magnetic ﬁeld lines are presented in Fig. 1. They are superimposed

on the distribution of the magnetic z component. The poloidal components (r, θ) and

the nonuniform parts of the toroidal components (z) of our v and B are proportional to

each other but generally with diﬀerent coeﬃcients of proportionality. This means that in

our case the ﬂow reshuﬄes the magnetic ﬁeld lines inside each of the magnetic surfaces

A(r, θ) = constant but it preserves the surfaces themselves. It can be noticed also that the

distribution of magnetic ﬂux can be imagined as generated by three sources with alternating

polarities lying on the plane y = 0.

Consider now how the above ideal equipotential solution is modiﬁed in the presence of a

ﬁnite z component of the electric ﬁeld. In two dimensions it has been shown in Ref. 8 that

a non-vanishing Ez causes the appearance of a singularity at r = rc in the current density,

vorticity and azimuthal components of the magnetic and velocity ﬁelds. Indeed, one class

of solutions can be written as follows

A1 = C1 ln r + C2,

ψ1 = αA1,

These expressions show that, as in the 2D case, the presence of a non-vanishing Ez leads to

the appearance of singularities in the distributions of physical values.

In particular, there is a singularity in the current density distribution (Fig. 2) as well as

in the distributions of A0

, H0

and V0

. This means in turn that both the toroidal (z)

(30)

In other words, these 2 1

2D solutions inherit the singularities from the corresponding 2D
solutions although the interpretation of the inherited singularities compared to the original

ones diﬀers in several important respects.

As was shown above, the equipotential 2D magnetic conﬁguration has a null point or, if

one extends the system to three dimensions, a null line parallel to the invariant z direction.

If an electric ﬁeld E appears in the system, it may have just one z component due to the

assumed two-dimensionality of the ﬂow. The steadiness of the ﬂow requires also that this

electric ﬁeld must be uniform. The latter implies in particular the presence of the electric

ﬁeld at the place where the null point (or null line) was initially located in the equipotential

conﬁguration. According to the frozen-in law condition, however, the ﬁnite value of E is

sustained by the inductive ﬁeld −v × B only. So, kinematically, the presence of E 6= 0 at a

magnetic null point would compel the velocity v to be inﬁnite there. In our self-consistent

8

approach, incorporating both kinematics and dynamics of plasma, any velocity singularity

may coexist only with an appropriate magnetic singularity, appearing at the same point

in the result of the corresponding force balance. This is the reason why the magnetic null

point of the equipotential conﬁguration transforms into the proper magnetic singularity

when passing in the considered family of exact 2D solutions to the conﬁguration with a

non-vanishing electric ﬁeld.

The situation becomes diﬀerent for our 2 1

2D conﬁgurations, which generally have no longer
null points. Therefore we cannot appeal to the above “null-point” argument to explain

the origin of the inherited singularities. The desirable explanation in fact can be found

considering the consequences of the presence of ﬁeld lines with a ﬁnite longitudinal voltage

drop13, denoted also as singular magnetic ﬁeld lines14. Our 2 1

2D equipotential conﬁguration
has in place of the null line a straight magnetic ﬁeld line parallel to z axis. Passing to

non-equipotential conﬁgurations in our family of solutions leads to the appearance of a

constant z component of the electric ﬁeld, which inevitably creates the above mentioned

voltage drop along a straight magnetic ﬁeld line. Kinematically, such a voltage drop in

a plasma with an inﬁnite conductivity may be sustained by a suitable velocity singularity

only14. Our self-consistent consideration, incorporating plasma dynamics, shows that such

a velocity singularity gives birth to an appropriate magnetic singularity by analogy with the

2D case. Thus, our stationary 2 1

2D ideal MHD solutions provide a particular but explicit
realization of singular magnetic ﬁeld lines, whose properties were kinematically described

ﬁrst by Schindler et al.13 in a more general non-stationary case, where the voltage drop was

localized at a ﬁnite part of such lines.

The above qualitative consideration shows that the appearance of singularities at the

null line or singular magnetic ﬁeld line can be anticipated if one combines the results of an

analysis based on both the kinematics and the dynamics of a plasma. However, our explicit

solutions reveal a much less obvious feature of this process, namely, that the singularity

appears not only at the null or singular magnetic ﬁeld lines but also at the whole magnetic

separatrix surface r = rc containing such lines.

In a more simple neutral X-type point

conﬁguration a similar fact follows from the frozen-in law and incompressibility conditions

if one assumes also that the resulting plasma ﬂow crosses one of the two separatrices and

is parallel to the other15. These conditions are suﬃcient for the appearance of a singularity

along the separatrix which is not crossed by the ﬂow. The self-consistent incorporation of

9

the plasma dynamics just makes the type of such a singularity more precise. One can also

see this from the ideal MHD limit of Craig-Henton solution6 and from the same limit of

more general solutions7. It is not diﬃcult to show that the considered point of view remains

valid for our 2D and 2 1

2D solutions in curvilinear geometry as well.

Thus, the above discussion suggests that the “extension” of the singularity from the null or

singular ﬁeld line to the whole separatrix surface is somehow eﬀected by the incompressibility

condition. This suggestion, however, looks not convincing enough if one remembers that in

the three-dimensional case the velocity singularity at the fan separatrix surfaces of magnetic

nulls appears already in a purely kinematic approach16 without any involvement of the

incompressibility condition. So the complete clariﬁcation of the nature of the separatrix

singularities is still a matter of the future development of the theory. Irrespective of the

ultimate answer to this question, it is important to study how such singularities are resolved

in the framework of a self-consistent MHD approach by a ﬁnite resistivity, which is an issue

of the next section.

V. RESISTIVE SOLUTIONS

derived in Ref. 12. These solutions describe a 2D reconnective annihilation in a curved

current layer formed on one of the magnetic separatrices when the other is crossed by a

sheared ﬂow. The magnetic and velocity ﬁelds have a null point and a stagnation point,

respectively, whose positions, contrary to the case considered in Sec. IV, are in general not

coincident. Considering now the 2 1

2D problem, we ﬁrst notice that Eqs. (28) are solutions

The resulting magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is represented in Fig. 3. The plot refers to

the particular case where the line (r = rc, θ = 0) is a magnetic null line. A more general

conﬁguration without this null line may be obtained by simply adding any constant value to

the corresponding Bz distribution. This would give us an example of the resistive solution

which in the limit of the ideal MHD describes the above mentioned conﬁguration with

singular magnetic ﬁeld line.

In Fig. 4 the absolute value of the current density is plotted. Comparing this plot with

the one shown in Fig. 2, one can see the eﬀect of introducing a ﬁnite resistivity, which

indeed resolves the singularity at the critical radius.

As already noticed in Ref. 8, the conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld in the xy plane described

by our resistive solutions is of particular interest for modeling the reconnection process in a

special large class of solar ﬂares. One can see from Fig. 3 that the magnetic ﬁeld here is gen-

erated by three sources with alternating polarities on the plane y = 0. Observations17 show

that a large fraction of solar ﬂares occurs namely in conﬁgurations with three photospheric

12

magnetic sources. The 2 1

2D solutions presented in this paper provide a generalization which

makes the previous 2D model more realistic.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We presented a class of steady solutions of resistive incompressible MHD equations in

cylindrical coordinates. These solutions describe three-dimensional velocity and magnetic

ﬁelds with a translational invariance along the z axis in a half-space corresponding to the

solar corona. Both ﬁelds are represented as a superposition of poloidal and toroidal (z)

components, so that the resulting ﬁelds have no null points in the volume. The poloidal

ﬁelds, however, have one null line along which two separatrix surfaces intersect. One of

the separatrices is the same for poloidal velocity and magnetic ﬁelds and it is a segment of

cylinder with the edges at the photospheric boundary. The other separatrices are diﬀerent

and they intersect the cylindrical separatrix along the null lines of poloidal ﬁelds in such

a way that these lines lie at some distance from each other. The resulting plasma ﬂow

intersects the non-cylindrical separatrix of the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld to produce a strong

shearing motion along the cylindrical separatrix, where a strong current layer is formed.

Thus, our solution is a curvilinear analog of the planar reconnective magnetic annihilation

considered earlier in Ref. 6 and generalized in Ref. 7.

In addition to the curvature it

has two more features of interest. First, there are non-vanishing and non-uniform toroidal

components of the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld in the corresponding conﬁguration. Secondly,

the resulting distribution of magnetic ﬁelds on the photosphere represents three areas of

alternating polarities. This feature is very interesting for modeling a wide class of solar

ﬂares which have three photospheric magnetic sources of diﬀerent polarities.

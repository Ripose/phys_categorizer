Abstract

The turbulent transport of impurity or minority species, as for example Tritium, is investigated in drift-

Alfv´en edge turbulence. The full effects of perpendicular and parallel convection are kept for the impurity

species. The impurity density develops a granular structure with steep gradients and locally exceeds its

initial values due to the compressibility of the ﬂow. An approximate decomposition of the impurity ﬂux into

a diffusive part and an effective convective part (characterized by a pinch velocity) is performed and a net

inward pinch effect is recovered. The pinch velocity is explained in terms of Turbulent Equipartition [1] and

is found to vary poloidally. The results show that impurity transport modeling needs to be two-dimensional,

considering besides the radial direction also the strong poloidal variation in the transport coefﬁcients.

The transport properties of impurities are of great concern in magnetic fusion devices. In par-

ticular impurities accumulate in the center of the plasma, where they are responsible for signiﬁcant

radiation losses. It is well established that turbulence is the key drive for plasma transport in the

edge region and thus turbulence will also dominate the transport of impurities in that region. While

in neutral ﬂuids the transport of passive scalars is a very active ﬁeld of research [2], it has in the

context of plasma turbulence not yet found corresponding attention and measurements of impu-

rity transport are most often interpreted within reduced 1D transport models [3, 4]. In plasma

turbulence the velocity ﬁeld is in general compressible what makes the transport and mixing more

complex than in incompressible ﬂows [2]. This puts strong demands on the numerical modeling.

Pinching of impurities has been observed as well as fast inwards transport of trace Tritium in

JET Tritium puffs [5]. Especially in the edge region an inward convective ﬂux (pinch) of impurites

is found, which is proportional to the measured diffusion [3]. In the core where anomalous, turbu-

lent transport is less important than in the edge the observed inward pinch of impurities seems to

be in good agreement with neoclassical predictions based on trapped particle orbits. The Pﬁrsch-

Schl¨uter impurity transport in the edge [6], leads to an inward impurity pinch due to ion-impurity

collisions. However, there is no explanation for the high inward pinch velocities needed to de-

scribe impurity transport through in the turbulent edge region and it’s scaling with the effective

diffusion.

Here we investigate the transport of impurities as a passive tracer ﬁeld in electromagnetic edge

turbulence described by a standard model of drift-Alfv´en turbulence [7, 8, 9]. Flux tube geometry

is used, with local slab-like coordinates (x, y, s) [10]. The following equations for the ﬂuctuations

To determine the evolution of the impurity density nimp we assume that the contribution of the

impurities to the gross plasma density ni,0 is negligible, i. e. ni = ni,0 + nimp ≈ ni,0. In experiments

the assumption ni,0 ≫ nimp is possibly not always fulﬁlled, especially not during the initial phase of

a Tritium gas puff, where locally in the edge region the Tritium migth contribute a signiﬁcant part

of overall plasma density. The bulk plasma is quasineutral with ne = ni,0, allowing to regard either

the ion- or electron continuity equation to determine the density evolution. We can, however, not

use a corresponding relation for nimp. For cold impurities the drift velocity is given by the E × B-

and the ion polarisation drift:

dtnimp =

The dynamical equation for the impurity density thus differs from the dynamical equation for

effects of the impurity ions enter through the ion-polarisation drift and ﬁnally all convection terms

need to be preserved, while for example parallel convection is neglected in the dynamical equation

for the density ﬂuctuations. Note that the equation for the impurity species do not reﬂect the

properties of the equilibrium as given by Eqs. (3) and (4) as the impurities are not assumed to

contribute signiﬁcantly to the establishment of quasi-neutrality.

In the saturated turbulent state the equilibrium density gradient is weakly ﬂattened. Strong

deviations from the initially speciﬁed density gradient are, however, prevented by a feed-back

mechanism using two damping layers at the inner and outer radial boundary. This forces the

ﬂux-surface averaged density to stay close to its initially speciﬁed equilibrium proﬁle.

To investigate impurity diffusion in fully developed, quasi-stationary turbulence we numeri-

cally solve Eqs. (1) and let initial perturbations develop until a state of saturated, quasistationary

turbulence is reached. The impurities are then released into the turbulence and convected around

by the turbulence according to the evolving turbulent velocity ﬁeld. The initial impurity density

nimp is chosen as a radially localized Gaussian added to a constant impurity background density.

For some runs the impurity density was additionally localized along the magnetic ﬁeld lines, that

is in coordinate s, to investigate the effect of parallel convective transport. Here we choose to

investigate the behavior of massless impurities. The coupled system of bulk plasma turbulence

and impurities is evolved until signiﬁcant mixing of the impurities has been achieved and initial

transient effects have decayed. For each parameter several runs are performed to increase the

statistical signiﬁcance of the results.

From the transport of passive ﬁelds in compressible ﬂuid turbulence it is well known that the

passive quantity reveals a much ﬂatter ﬂuctuation spectrum than the turbulent energy spectrum,

moreover the passive scalar tends to accumulate in the contracting regions of the turbulent ﬂow

ﬁeld [2]. Thus, the impurity density after some time not only exhibits strong gradients, but locally

the initial value of the impurity density can be exceeded. To be able to handle these effects within

the given limited resolution the diffusive term in Eq. (5) was chosen as µimp = 5µn

A prominent feature of the impurity behavior is the weak parallel convective transport com-

4

pared to the radial turbulent transport. The reason is that the impurities are convected in the par-

allel direction by the ﬂuctuating parallel ion speed u which is small u ≈ 0.01 compared to a radial

velocity that is of order one. This is clearly observed in Fig. 1, which shows the impurity density

projected onto a geometrically poloidal cut. The projection roughly translates the variation in s to
a poloidal variation. s = 0 corresponds to the outboard midplane, s = p /2 to the upper, s = −p /2
to the lower side and ﬁnally s = ±p corresponds to the high ﬁeld side. The radial extend of the

simulation domain has been stretched to allow better visualization. The initial impurity density

is localized at the outboard midplane, corresponding to a parallel localization in the ﬂux tube ge-

ometry. No signiﬁcant parallel ﬂow of the impurity density is observed, while signiﬁcant radial

mixing occurs. Parallel compressional effects are however visible and arrange for ﬁnite passive

density gradients at the high ﬁeld side. Moreover an inward pinch effect is clearly observed at the

outboard midplane.

initial condition (Figure 2).

associated to a pinch effect:

By starting from an initial impurity distribution that is homogeneous along s, this pinching

velocity is seen to lead to a shift towards the torus axis of the impurity density compared to the

For a more quantitative description of this behavior, the ﬂux G of the impurity ion species can

in lowest order be expressed by a diffusion coefﬁcient D and a convective velocity V , which is

G y(s) = −D(s)¶ x < n >y +V (s) < n >y .

The turbulence is radially homogeneous and so there is no radial dependence of D and V . Aver-

ages are taken along the periodic y direction. We obtain these values for each value of s along the
magnetic ﬁeld lines and thus at different poloidal positions. From a scatter plot of G (r)/ < n >y
versus ¶ x < ln n >y the parameters D(s) and V (s) can be obtained. These are standard parameters
used in modeling and in evaluation of transport experiments. The ﬁtting procedure is carried out

using a standard nonlinear least-squares Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm [12] as implemented in

the GNUPLOT software. Figure 3 shows such a typical scatter plot with a ﬁtted linear relation

between the two quantities indicating that while there are signiﬁcant deviations from a linear re-

lationship, the decomposition of the transport into D and V has some merit. The comparison of

the evolution of the impurity density proﬁle with the analytical evolution of the proﬁle using the

values for D and V , obtained from an analysis as shown in Figure 3 is depicted in Figure 4.

The poloidal dependence of diffusion and effective convection is rather strong and depicted in

5

Fig. 5. The effective convective velocity V (s) changes sign and is at the high ﬁeld side directed

outwards. This pinching velocity is due to normal curvature and can be consistently explained in

the framework of Turbulent EquiPartition (TEP) [1, 13]. In the absence of parallel convection,

ﬁnite mass effects and diffusion Eq. (5) has the following approximate Lagrangian invariant

L(s) = ln nimp + w Bcos(s)x − w Bsin(s)y .

(6)

Its spatial homogenization on each drift plane < L(s) >y= const(s) by the turbulence indi-

cates that at the outboard midplane (s = 0) the impurites are effectively convected radially inward
const. − w Bx) while at the high ﬁeld side they are
leading to a radially gradient (< ln nimp >y(cid:181)
const. + w Bx). One should note that this
effectively convected radially outward (< ln nimp >y(cid:181)
effective inward or outward convection is not found as an average E × B velocity, but is miti-

gated by the effect of homogenization of L under the action of the turbulence. The strength of the

“pinch” effect is consequently proportional to the mixing properties of the turbulence and thus to

lowest order has an additional variation that scales with the measured turbulent diffusion, so that
V (s) (cid:181) − cos(s)D(s). The slight ballooning in the turbulence level thus causes the inward ﬂow

on the outboard midplane to be stronger than the effective outﬂow on the high-ﬁeld side. Aver-

aged over a ﬂux surface and assuming poloidally constant impurity density a net impurity inﬂow

results. The net pinch is directly proportional to the diffusion coefﬁcient D in agreement with

experimental observations [14]. Translated to dimensional values for typical large tokamak edge
parameters we obtain D(s) (cid:181) 1.5 − 2.0 m2/s and V (s) (cid:181) +60 − −80 m/s and an ﬂux-surface aver-

aged inward convection velocity of < V >= −0.4 m/s. Locally at the outboard midplane values
of V (s = 0)/D(s = 0) ∼ −40m−1 are found, in rough agreement with experimental values [3].

Furthermore we observe a slight shift of the peak diffusion coefﬁcient in the diamagnetic di-

rection. This effect is likely due to the spreading of the turbulence [15] in that direction leading

to enhanced turbulence levels slightly upward from the outboard midplane and consequently to an

up-down asymmetry.

The strong peaking of the impurity density, the poloidal dependence of the transport coefﬁ-

cients and the slow parallel diffusion of the impurities thus make it necessary to apply at least two

dimensional modeling. Both a poloidally varying diffusion coefﬁcient and effective convection

velocity should be used in transport codes to describe impurity density evolution. The observed

impurity pinch in the edge plasma region can be explained by turbulent equipartition without in-

voking arguments from neoclassical transport theory.

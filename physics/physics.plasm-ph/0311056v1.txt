Abstract

Analytic solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium equations for a cylindri-
cally symmetric magnetically conﬁned plasma with reversed magnetic shear, s < 0, and
sheared ﬂow are constructed by prescribing the safety factor-, poloidal velocity- and ax-
ial velocity- proﬁles consistently with experimental ones. On the basis of the solutions
obtained in most of the cases considered it turns out that an increase of |s| and of the
velocity components result in larger absolute values for the radial electric ﬁeld, Er, its
shear, |dEr/dr| ≡ |E′
r|, and the E × B velocity shear, ωE×B = |d/dr(E × B/B2)|, which
may play a role in the formation of Internal Transport Barriers (ITBs) in tokamaks. In
particular for a constant axial magnetic ﬁeld, ωE×B at the point where E′
r = 0 is propor-
tional to 1 − s. Also, |E′
r| and ωE×B increase as the velocity shear takes larger values. The
results clearly indicate that s < 0 and sheared ﬂow act synergetically in the formation of
ITBs with the impact of the ﬂow, in particular the poloidal one, being stronger than that
of s < 0.

Introduction

Understanding Internal Transport Barriers (ITBs) in plasmas is very important for
the advanced tokamak scenarios [2],[3]. The ITBs usually are associated with reversed
magnetic shear proﬁles [4],[5] and their main characteristics are steep pressure proﬁles in
the barrier region [6] and radial electric ﬁelds associated with sheared ﬂows [7], [8]. The
mechanism responsible for the formation of ITBs is far for completely understood. It is
believed that the ﬂow, the radial electric ﬁeld, its shear and the E × B velocity shear,

play a role in the barrier formation by mode decorrelation thus resulting in a reduction
of the outward particle and energy transport [3], [9], [10].

The experimental evidence up to date has not made clear whether the reversed mag-
netic shear, s < 0, or the sheared ﬂow (toroidal or poloidal) are more important for the
ITBs formation. In some experiments the safety factor proﬁle is considered as the crucial
[11]) while according to others the necessity of reversed magnetic shear
quantity (e.g.
is questionable (e.g.
[9]). On the other hand, the ﬂow-either toroidal [12] or poloidal
[13],[14] may be important in the formation of ITBs. Also, it has been argued that the
toroidal velocity may be more important than the poloidal one (see for example Ref. [13]).
It should be noted, however, that only few direct measurements of the poloidal velocity
have been performed; this velocity is usually calculated by means of neoclassical theory
[12].

The aim of the present work is to contribute to the answer of the above mentioned open
questions by studying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) cylindrical equilibria with reversed
magnetic shear and sheared ﬂow. The study can be viewed as an extension of a previous
one on tokamak equilibria with incompressible sheared ﬂows and monotonically increasing
q-proﬁles in connection with certain characteristics of the L-H transition [15]. The work is
conducted through the following steps: The proﬁles of certain free quantities, including the
safety factor and the velocity components are ﬁrst prescribed and then exact equilibrium
solutions are constructed self consistently. This is the subject of Sec. 2. In Sec. 3 on the
basis of the solutions obtained the equilibrium properties are examined and the impact
of s < 0 and the ﬂow on Er, E′
r and ωE×B is evaluated. The conclusions are summarized
in Sec. 4.

stemming from the radial component of the force-balance equation ρ(v·∇)v = j×B−∇P
with the aid of Amp´ere’s law. Here, P is the plasma pressure; Bθ and Bz are the poloidal
and axial components of the magnetic ﬁeld, respectively; M 2
θ is the square of
the Mach number deﬁned as the ratio of the poloidal velocity to the poloidal-magnetic-
ﬁeld Alfv´en velocity. Because of the symmetry any equilibrium quantity depends only on
the radial distance r and the axial velocity vz as well as the velocity shear do not appear

in (2); also, the ﬂow is incompressible. In addition to vz four out of the ﬁve quantities in
(2) can be prescribed.

On account of typical experimental ITB proﬁles we prescribed the quantities q, Bz,

vθ, vz and ̺ as follows:

where ρ = r/R0 with r0 deﬁning the plasma surface, qc = q(r = 0), rmin is the position
of minimum q, and ∆q = qc − qmin. The SRS-proﬁle (3) does exhibit a maximum at
the plasma center r = 0 in addition to the minimum one at r = rmin and has stronger
magnetic shear in the central region just inside the qmin position than that of the WRS
one. It should be clariﬁed, however, that the WRS proﬁle (4), which does not have an
extremum on the magnetic axis r = 0, has been chosen in order to simplify the calculations
though the physical situation may not be well represented in the immediate vicinity of
the magnetic axis;

Bz = Bz0

where Bz0 is the vacuum magnetic ﬁeld and the parameter δ is related to the magnetic
properties of the plasma, i.e. for δ < 0 the plasma is diamagnetic;

or Gaussian-like vz proﬁle similar to that of (6); and the density proﬁle

vz = vz0(1 − ρ3)3

̺ = ̺0(1 − ρ3)3.

The following quantities can then be calculated: the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld Bθ =
ǫρBz/q where ǫ = r0/R0 is the inverse aspect ratio with 2πR0 associated with the length
of the plasma column; the magnetic shear s = (r/q)(dq/dr); the current density via
Ampere’ s law; the electric ﬁeld via Ohm’ s law; its shear E′
r and ωE×B by (1). Also,
integration of (2) so that P (r = r0) = 0 yields the pressure. The calculations have been
performed analytically by developing a programme for symbolic computations [16] in
connection with Ref. [17]. This also allowed us to examine conveniently purely poloidal
ﬂows, purely axial ﬂows, z-pinch conﬁgurations or θ-pinch conﬁgurations as particular
cases. The analytic expressions which can be derived readily by the programme are
generally lengthy and will not be given explicitly here. Some concise and instructive
expressions will only be presented in the next section along with typical proﬁles for the
calculated quantities supporting the results obtained.

We have set the following values for some of the parameters: Bz0 = 1 Tesla, ̺0 = 8.35×
10−8kgr/m3 corresponding to n0 = 5 × 1019 particles/m3, ρmin = 0.5, ǫ = r0/R0 ≈ 1/3,
δ = −0.0975, qmin = 2, max vθ = 1×104 m/sec and max vz = 1×105 m/sec; Consequently,
it is guaranteed that M 2
z , a scaling typical in tokamaks
because Bz ≈ 10 Bθ and vz ≈ 10 vθ. It is noted here that since in tokamaks Mθ < 0.1 the
ﬂow term in (2) is perturbative around the “static” equilibrium Mθ = 0. Also, the choice
qmin = 2 was made because according to experimental evidence for qmin < 2 strong MHD
activity destroys conﬁnement possibly due to a double tearing mode [18]. A similar result
was found numerically for one-dimensional cylindrical equilibria with hollow currents in
Ref. [19]. The impact of the magnetic shear and ﬂow on the equilibrium, in particular on
the quantities Er, E′
r and ωE×B, was examined by varying the parameters qc, ∆q, h, vz0,
and vθ0 [Eqs. (3), (4), (6) and (7)].

For reversed magnetic shear proﬁles we came to the following conclusions:

(cid:3)

For s < 0, increase of |s| makes the pressure proﬁle steeper (see also Fig. 2). Equa-
tion (9) also implies that the pressure proﬁle becomes steeper when the plasma is more
diamagnetic, i.e. when B′

z related to the parameter δ in (5) takes larger values.

2. Current density

• The axial current density proﬁle becomes hollow and, irrespective of the reversal of
the magnetic shear, there is a critical distance ρcr outside the qmin position at which
Jz becomes negative (Fig. 3). In particular, for Bz = Bz0 = const. one obtains

Jz =

(10)

Consequently, for s > 2, Jz reverses. The radial distances at which Jz = 0 for the
SRS [Eq. (3)] and the WRS [Eq. (4)] q-proﬁles, respectively, are

and

Therefore, the position of ρcr is shifted towards the center as s takes lower nega-
tive values. It is noted here that equilibrium toroidal current density reversal for
monotonically increasing q-proﬁles was reported in Ref. [20] (Fig. 3 therein).

• Very large values of ∆q on the order of 102 result in the formation of jz proﬁles with
”holes” in the central region- jz ≈ 0- inside the ρmin position as demonstrated in
Fig. 4, a result consistent with experimental evidence ([21], [22]).

• The total axial current Iz = 2πr0Bθ(r0) for SRS proﬁles is smaller than that for

WRS proﬁles.

3. Er and E′
r

• Typical Er proﬁles exhibit an extremum in the region around qmin and vanish at
ρ = 0 and ρ = 1 in agreement with experimental ones [7], [23]. Proﬁles with more
than one extrema are also possible in the case of peaked vz proﬁles, localized vθ ones
and vzvθ > 0 as demonstrated in Fig. 5. Experimental proﬁles of this kind were
reported in Ref. [23] (Fig. (9) therein).

• The main contribution to Er comes from the velocity, to which is proportional, and

particularly from the poloidal one (Fig. 6).

• Er is sensitive to the relative orientation of vz, vθ and Bz; in particular, for vzvθ < 0
r (Fig. 8)

|Er| is larger than that for vzvθ > 0. (Fig. 7). Similar results hold for E′
and ωE×B .

• For extended velocity proﬁles with vz 6= 0, an increase of |s| results in an increase
of |Er| (Fig. 9), |E′
r| and ωE×B. If vz = 0, however, |s| has no impact on |Er| and
|E′
r|, as can be seen by inspection of E = v × B, and very weak impact on ωE×B.
This result indicates that the presence of vz ”activates” the impact of s on Er, E′
r
and ωE×B.

• An increase of the velocity shear nearly does not aﬀect or even decreases the maxi-

mum |Er| (Fig. 10) but increases |E′

r| (Fig. 11).

4. ωE×B

• A typical proﬁle of ωE×B has two large local maxima at the positions where the
edges of the barrier are expected to be located in addition to other two smaller local
ones (Fig. 12). In most of the cases considered the maximum in the s < 0 region
is slightly larger than that in the s > 0 region. (see Fig. 12). In particular, for
Bz = const. at the point where E′
r = 0 one obtains:

ωE×B =

Eq. (11) implies the following:

(11)

1. ωE×B depends on the relative sign of vz, vθ and Bz, a result which we conﬁrmed

by ωE×B proﬁles obtained via the symbolic computation programme.

2. The factor (1 − s) indicates that ωE×B for nearly shearless stellarator equilibria

may be lower than that for tokamak equilibria with s < 0.

3. Despite the scaling vz ≈ 10vθ, for tokamak pertinent parametric values the
contributions of vz-in connection with the term ǫρvz/q- and vθ to ωE×B are of
the same order of magnitude, a result indicating the importance of the poloidal
velocity.

• For extended velocities (large values of the parameter h or/and peaked vz- proﬁle)

a percentage increase of |s| in the barrier region results:

1. in approximately the same percentage increase of ωE×B if the velocity is purely

axial (Fig. 13).

2. nearly does not aﬀect the value of ωE×B if vθ 6= 0.

• An increase of the ﬂow shear (variation of the parameter h from 0.1 to 0.001) causes
a mean percentage increase of ωE×B as large as 0.7 of that of the ﬂow shear. (Fig.
14).

• The impact of a variation of the vθ-shear on ωE×B is stronger than of the same

variation of the vz-shear.

vz proﬁles.

• The maximum increase of ωE×B is caused by vθ in the case of non-vanishing peaked

• Inspection of vE×B = E × B/B2 and (1) implies that ωE×B for a z-pinch is equal
to that for an equilibrium with purely axial ﬂow. The same equality is valid for a
θ-pinch in comparison with an equilibrium with purely poloidal ﬂow. In addition,
it holds that

ωE×B−z-pinch ≈ 10ωE×B−θ−pinch.

(12)

4. Conclusions

The self consistent study of cylindrical equilibria with reversed magnetic shear and

sheared ﬂow presented in the previous sections led to the following conclusions:

1. For reversed magnetic shear proﬁles (s < 0):

• The larger values of |s| the steeper the pressure proﬁle.

• The axial current density proﬁle become hollow.

• Strong reversed shear proﬁles formed by appropriately large values of ∆q are

associated with ”hole” axial current density proﬁles.

These results are consistent with experimental ones.

2. Irrespective of the sign of s the axial current density can reverse in the outer plasma
region, the reversal point being shifted towards the plasma core as s takes lower
negative values.

3. An increase of either |s| or the velocity results generally in an increase of |Er|, |E′
r|

and ωE×B.

4. An increase of the velocity shear results in an increase of |E′

r| and ωE×B.

6

5. For a given value of |s|, ωE×B takes slightly larger values in the s < 0 region than

in the s > 0 region.

6. Er, E′

r and ωE×B are sensitive to the relative orientation of vθ, vz and Bz.

In

particular, they take larger values for vzvθ < 0 rather than for vzvθ > 0.

7. The presence of vz activates s < 0, in the sense that for vz = 0, Er and E′

r are

s-independent. Also, for vz = 0, s < 0 has very weak impact on ωE×B.

8. The impact of the poloidal ﬂow and its shear on Er, E′

r and ωE×B is stronger than

that of the axial ﬂow and the magnetic shear.

Presuming that Er, E′

r and ωE×B are of relevance to the ITBs formation, the above
results clearly indicate that the reversed magnetic shear and the sheared ﬂow have syner-
getic eﬀects on this formation with the ﬂow, in particular the poloidal one, and its shear
playing an important role.

Experimental observations consistent with Self Organized Criticality (SOC) have been obtained
in the electrostatic ﬂoating potential ﬂuctuations of a dc glow discharge plasma. Power spectrum
exhibits a power law which is compatible with the requirement for SOC systems. Also the estimated
value of the Hurst exponent (self similarity parameter), H being greater than 0.5, along with an
algebraic decay of the autocorrelation function, indicate the presence of temporal long-range corre-
lations, as may be expected from SOC dynamics. This type of observations in our opinion has been
reported for the ﬁrst time in a glow discharge system.

was recorded at a sampling rate ≈ 10−4 sec using a Tex-
tronix oscilloscope, and then transferred to the computer
for further analysis.

INTRODUCTION

The study of nonequilibrium phenomena of naturally
occurring [1], and laboratory plasmas [1, 2] has been an
active area of research in plasma physics. Within this
frame work, the Self Organized Criticality (SOC) con-
cept has been quite rigorously deployed to explain some
of the turbulent transport observations in magnetically
conﬁned fusion devices like Tokamaks [2, 3]. The physics
of glow discharge plasmas [4] in the last two decades, have
generated a renewed interest due to their importance in
low temperature plasma applications [5, 6]. Being a non-
linear medium, they have been a good test bed to investi-
gate various nonlinear phenomena like chaos etc [7, 8, 9].
In this paper we have attempted to apply, quite success-
fully the SOC concept for the ﬁrst time to some of the
turbulent ﬂuctuations in a glow discharge plasma.

The outline of the paper is as follows: In Section II
we describe the experimental setup and observations. In
Section III we present the analysis techniques and results
of the spectral and statistical methods that have been
carried to substantiate the SOC behavior. Finally we
summarize our results in Section IV.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS

The experiment was carried out in a coaxial cylindrical
glow dc discharge plasma system with argon as shown in
Figure 1. The hollow Stainless Steel (SS) outer cylin-
der of 45 mm diameter is the cathode and the SS rod of
1 mm diameter inside the cathode is the anode, which
is grounded. The whole system was placed in a vac-
uum chamber, and evacuated to a base pressure of 10−3
Torr by means of a rotary pump. Argon gas was in-
troduced using precision needle valve into the chamber.
Plasma discharges were obtained over a wide range of
ﬁlling pressure and discharge voltage. A Langmuir probe
made of tungsten of diameter ≈ 0.5 mm and length ≈ 2
mm was used to measure the electrostatic ﬂoating po-
tential ﬂuctuations in the plasma at about 12.5 mm from

Keeping the discharge voltage at a constant value of
800 V, a discharge was struck with a very faint glow at
∼ 9 × 10−3 Torr, and, then as the ﬁlling pressure was

≈ −5 V. So the critical pressure divides the scanned re-
gion into two regions I and II, shown by a vertical line
(−.−) in Figure 2. The plasma density, temperature, and
electron-electron collision mean free path in region II are
107 − 108cm−3, 2-4 eV, and 2.6 × 105 cm respectively.
However, in region I, it was almost impossible to obtain
the I-V characteristics because of their extremely low val-
ues. Qualitatively looking at discharge current, and glow
intensity, region II is probably a normal glow discharge
region, while region I might be the dark or subnormal
glow discharge region. The critical pressure where the
transition takes place is not a ﬁxed point, but decreases
with the discharge voltage as seen in Figure 3. It is also
seen that the ﬂoating potential, and the discharge current
also decrease with discharge voltage. Figures 4(a), (b),
and (c) are the typical electrostatic ﬂuctuations at pres-
sures 0.9 × 10−2, 1.2 × 10−2, and 1.5 × 10−2 Torr respec-
tively in region I, while (d), and (e) are the ﬂuctuations
at pressures 1.7 × 10−2 and 2.2 × 10−2 Torr respectively
in region II.

III. ANALYSIS OF SOC BEHAVIOR

The experimental evidences considered as main ingre-
dients of SOC are 1/f β (β >0) power law (where f
is the frequency of the ﬂuctuations obtained from Fast
Fourier Transform) [10, 11, 12, 13], long-range correla-
tion [14], and nongaussian probability distribution func-
tion (PDF) [15]. From the power spectral analysis we
have estimated the β from ln(Power) versus ln(f ). For
long-range time correlation we estimated the Hurst expo-
nent H, and the exponent (α) of Autocorrelation function
(ACF) decay, as described bellow.

Hurst Exponent-The Rescaled-Range

statistics
(R/S) method was proposed by Hurst and well estab-
lished by Mandelbrot, and Wallis [16]. For the time series
deﬁned above, the R/S is deﬁned as [16, 17] the ratio of
the maximal range of the integrated signal normalized to
the standard deviation:

R(n)
S(n)

=

max(0, W1, W2, ..., Wn) − min(0, W1, W2, ..., Wn)
pS2(n)

(1)
Here Wk = x1+x2+x3+...+xk−kX(n), where X, S2(n),
and n are respectively the mean, variance, and time lag
of the signal. The expected value of R/S scales like cnH
as n → ∞, where H is called the Hurst exponent. For
random data H=0.5, while H > 0.5 for the data with
long range correlations. H < 0.5 indicates the presence
of long-range anti-persistency in the data.
The ACF has been derived as follows:

[Xi, i = 1, 2, ...n], the ACF function can be written as

gradually increased by means of the needle valve, the
intensity of the glow suddenly became bright at about
1.6 × 10−2 Torr. The sudden change in the plasma dy-
namics at the critical pressure led to a change in the ﬂoat-
ing potential, and the discharge current. The variation of
the plasma ﬂoating potential, and the plasma discharge
current with pressure have been shown in Figure 2. It
shows that, the current (solid line) jumped to a larger
value by a factor of 15 at 1.6 × 10−2 Torr, and then in-
creased gradually with pressure. On the other hand, The
ﬂoating potential rapidly fell to a negative value (≈ −9
V) up to the same critical pressure (1.6 × 10−2 Torr),
and then again increased (dotted line in Fig. 2) with fur-
ther increase in pressure, until it ﬁnally settled down to

series respectively. If there is long-range time dependence
in the system, then the algebraic decay of the ACF can
be written as [19]

(this indicates long-range time correlations) [21], and it
is almost constant over the entire pressure range in re-
gion I. On the other hand, for sinusoidal like oscillation
in region II, the Hurst exponent is 1 for the lag length of
one period of oscillations, and zero with more than one
period lag [16] as shown in Figure 7. Also in the same

same ﬁgure. We suspect that there might be a slightly
bimodal distribution similar to Ref. [12]. Figure 10(b)
shows the Gaussian nature of the ﬂuctuations in region
II.

Our results of Hurst exponent, H > 0.5, ACF expo-
nent, α ∼ 0.30, nongaussian PDF, and power spectral
index β ∼ 1.60 in the pressure range 9×10−3−1.6×10−2
Torr, are consistent with the systems exhibiting SOC like
behavior.

Comparison of α, H by ACF, H by R/S, and β have
been shown in Table I, for pressures 0.9 × 10−2, 1.2 ×
10−2, 1.5 × 10−2 Torr.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have obtained SOC behavior over a ﬁnite range
of neutral pressure of 9 × 10−3 − 1.6 × 10−2 Torr for a
ﬁxed discharge voltage. Glow discharges are simple sys-
tems, but their physics can be quite complicated due to
the presence of several phenomena like avalanche break-
down, ionization waves, low frequency ion-acoustic insta-
bility, double layer, chaos etc. Most of them are highly
nonlinear processes and hence one requires diﬀerent tech-
niques both statistical and spectral to investigate and
understand their behavior. From our present analysis
we observe that the plasma dynamics in the region I is
compatible with self organized criticality, while region II
is not. This could also imply that plasma transport in
region I is quite diﬀerent from region II. Detailed investi-
gations of the spatio-temporal chaos, and the multifractal
nature of these ﬂuctuations are in progress and will be
reported else where.

lated for the ﬂuctuations in region I from the ln(ACF) vs.
ln(time lag) plot as shown in Figure 9. The ACF (Fig. 9)
shows power law up to about 6 times the decorrelation
time, and after that it follows exponential decay. Average
value of α is about 0.30. Using the relation H = (2−α)/2
[19], H calculated from ACF is ∼ 0.85, which is close to
the value of H, calculated using R/S technique. In region
II no power law decay of ACF has been observed. The
PDF of the ﬂoating potential ﬂuctuations in region I seen
in Fig. 10(a) clearly shows a nongaussian nature. Corre-
sponding best gaussian ﬁt is given by dotted curve in the

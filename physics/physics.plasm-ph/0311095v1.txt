(Dated: February 2, 2008)

In dielectric breakdown, the phenomena of streamers formation and spontaneous branching is
commonly observed. A deterministic negative streamer model is reviewed in this article. We recently
have proposed that this reduced model is able to explain the branching phenomena, due to a
Laplacian instability quite like in viscous ﬁngering. Particular attention is paid to the physical
interpretation of the model.

INTRODUCTION

Atoms of any substance are electrically neutral. If we
apply an electric ﬁeld to a volume ﬁlled with neutral par-
ticles, the electric current will not ﬂow through that vol-
ume. Since no charged particles are present, there will
not be any electric current, which is in fact the directed
motion of charged particles. Thus, the volume, ﬁlled with
atoms of any substance, is an almost ideal insulator.

The air is a good example of such an insulator. Ev-
ery cubic centimetre of air contains roughly speaking
2.7 × 1019 molecules of oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2),
vapour (H2O) and some other gases. Every atom of oxy-
gen contains 8 positively charged protons and the same
number of negatively charged electrons. Every atom of
nitrogen contains 7 protons and 7 electrons.
It might
seem there are more than enough charged particles, but
those particles are bound by powerful electric forces to
form electrically neutral atoms and molecules, and as a
result of which the air is a perfect insulator.

However, if a strong electric ﬁeld is applied to matter
of low conductivity and some electrons or ions are cre-
ated by some agent, then these few mobile charges can
generate an avalanche of more charges by impact ioniza-
tion. A low temperature plasma is being created, result-
ing in an electric discharge. Examples range from natu-
ral phenomena like the familiar lightning and St.Elmo’s
ﬁre to lamps (neon tubes, hight brightness ﬂat computer
and TV screens) and industrial plasma reactors for com-
bustion gas cleaning, ozone generation, etc.1 There have
been a huge development of technologies based on this
phenomena. Laser pumping and ion chambers used for
particle detectors are other examples one can ﬁnd.

On the other hand, the understanding of the basic
mechanisms of the electric discharge is a challenging
problem where ideas from nonequilibrium thermodynam-
ics, atomic physics, electromagnetism and pattern forma-
tion come into play. Discharges are nonequilibrium pro-
cesses occurring in initially nonionized matter exposed
to strong electric ﬁeld. Depending on the spatiotempo-
ral characteristics of the electric ﬁeld and on the ion-
ization and charge transport properties of the medium,
discharges can assume many diﬀerent modes of appear-
ance. Phenomenologically discharges can be classiﬁed in

stationary ones, such as arc, glow or dark discharges and
transient ones, such as leaders, initial stages of sparks
and streamers.2 As a warning, the distinction between
the various discharge phenomena seems to vary among
authors.

A streamer is a sharp nonlinear ionization wave prop-
agating into a nonionized gas, leaving a nonequilibrium
plasma behind. They have been reported to appear
in early stages of atmospheric discharges3 like sparks
or sprite discharges.4 It is observed that streamers can
branch spontaneously, but how this branching is pre-
cisely determined by the underlying physics is essen-
tially an open question. We have proposed in recent
work5 a branching mechanism which is qualitatively dif-
ferent from other ideas. The older concept of dielec-
tric breakdown can be traced back to Raether’s work.6
In his model he introduced the rare long ranged photo-
ionization events. Some stochastic models for dielectric
breakdown have been proposed and studied since then.7
We used a fully deterministic model with pure impact
ionization and it becomes a surprise streamers get un-
stable and develop branching. The mechanism for this
branching is related to a Laplacian interfacial instability.
In this paper we will start introducing a basic ﬂuid
model incorporating the physical ingredients to describe
a nonattaching gas such as nitrogen under normal con-
ditions. In Sec. III some numerical simulations based on
this model are shown.
In Sec. IV and the ones to fol-
low, the streamers branching is investigated by analyti-
cal means. We summarise the main results for stationary
planar fronts and in Sec. V for shock fronts. In Sec. VI
we set up the framework of the linear perturbation anal-
ysis for transversal Fourier modes, ﬁrst the equation of
motion and then the boundary conditions and the so-
lution strategy.
In Sec. VII we obtain the asymptotic
behaviour of the dispersion relation and ﬁnally, we end
with a summary and prospect of future work.

II. THE STREAMER MODEL

In this section we present a minimal streamer model,
i.e., a “ﬂuid approximation” with local ﬁeld-dependent
impact ionization reaction in a nonattaching gas like ar-
gon or nitrogen.8 It treats the dynamics of the free elec-

trons and positive ions in a homogeneous gas at rest. In
detail, this is as follows:
(i) The ionization by electrons in the gas is essentially
the primary process in all spark discharge. Initially, an
electron liberated by any outside agents, as e.g radiation,
is accelerated in a strong local ﬁeld. It collides into a neu-
tral molecule and ionises it. The result is a generation
of new free electrons and a positive ion. In general, this
process is determined by the rate of gain of energy of
the electrons and their ability to produce ionization once
they have suﬃcient energy. The energy gain depends on
the ﬁeld strength and the free path of electrons. The free
path depends on the pressure and character of the gas.
The calculation from ﬁrst principles of all this process is
not an easy task. Fortunately, one can measure it quite
simply by a procedure developed by Townsend.9 We can
then obtain the eﬀective cross-section α0 for a given ex-
ternal E0 electric ﬁeld, and use Townsend approximation
α0 α(|E|/E0) = α0 exp(−E0/|E|) to write the following
balance equations for electrons and ions

∂τ ne + ∇R · je = |µeEne| α0 α(E0/|E|)
∂τ ni + ∇R · ji = |µeEne| α0 α(E0/|E|)

(1)
(2)

where ne,i and je,i are particle densities and currents of
electrons and ions, respectively, and E is the electric ﬁeld.
The fact that the source terms at the right hand side of
the equations are equal is due to charge conservation in
an ionization event.
(ii) The electron particle current je is approximated as
the sum of a drift and diﬀusion term

where µe and De are the mobility and diﬀusion coeﬃcient
of the electrons. For anode-directed streamers the ion
current can be neglected because it is more than two
orders of magnitude smaller that electronic one, so we
will take

ji = 0.

(4)

(iii) The modiﬁcation of the externally applied electric
ﬁeld through the space charges of the particles according
to the Poisson equation

∇R · E = e(ni − ne)/ε0.

(5)

It is this coupling between space charges and electric ﬁeld
which makes the problem nonlinear.

We want to add a few remarks. In the source term,
ionization due to the photons created in recombination
or scattering evens is neglected. This can be justiﬁed if
the cross section of the photoionization process is much
smaller than that due to electrons. Note that photoion-
ization can be taken into account, but the dynamical
equations will become nonlocal. In attaching gases like
oxygen, a third kind of charged species needs to be taken
into account, namely negative ions formed by a neutral

2

molecule catching a free electron.10 The equations are
deterministic and stochastic eﬀects are not accounted for
in the model.

Finally, the model must be complemented with appro-
priate boundary and initial conditions. Boundary condi-
tions will be discussed in detail in the next section. For
initial conditions, we ignore details of the plasma nucle-
ation event (e.g. triggering by radiation from an external
source), and assume that at t = 0 a small well-localized
ionization seed is present. We also make it clearer below.
In order to identify the physical scales and the intrinsic
parameters of the model, it is convenient to reduce the
equations to dimensionless form. The natural units of the
model are given by the ionization length R0 = α−1
0 , the
characteristic impact ionization ﬁeld E0 and the electron
mobility µe, determining the velocity v0 = µeE0 and the
time scale τ0 = R0/v0. The values of those quantities for
nitrogen at normal conditions are

α−1
0 ≈ 2.3 µm, E0 ≈ 200 kV/m, µe ≈ 380 cm2/Vs.

Hence we introduce the dimensionless coordinates8 r =
R/R0 and t = τ /τ0, the dimensionless ﬁeld E = E/E0,
the dimensionless electron and ion particle densities σ =
ne/n0 and ρ = ni/n0 with n0 = ε0E0/(eR0), and the
dimensionless diﬀusion constant D = De/(R0v0).

After this rescaling, the model reads

∂t σ − ∇ · j = σ f (|E|) ,
∂t ρ = σ f (|E|) ,
ρ − σ = ∇ · E ,

σ E + D ∇σ = j .

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

In this section we will present details of numerical sim-
ulations of the streamer model discussed previously. In
conﬁned geometries streamers usually have a nontrivial
ﬁnger like shape.
In general two regions can be ob-
served. The interior of the streamer is an ionized region,
quasineutral and equipotential. The outer region is ﬁlled
with the nonionized gas. Those two regions are separated
by a very narrow region in which all the most of the ion-
ization process is taking place. In this same space there
is a nonzero charge density and consequently a very large
electric ﬁeld gradient. This is one of the reasons why ac-
curate simulations are rather demanding. These features
are strongly reminiscent of what occurs in combustion
fronts11 and viscous ﬁngering.12

Simulations based on this model as far we know
were accomplished by Dhali and Willians13 and by
Vitello et. al.14 There is also some work by Wang and
Kunhardt.15 In Fig. 1 we can see some simulations of the

FIG. 1: Evolution of spontaneous branching of anode directed streamers in a strong homogeneous background ﬁeld at times
t = 300, 365, 420 and 450. Model, initial and boundary conditions are discussed in the text. The planar cathode is located at
z = 0 and the planar anode at z = 2000 (shown is 0 ≤ z ≤ 1400). The radial coordinate extends from the origin up to r = 2000

model. A planar cathode is located at z = 0 and a planar
anode at z = 2000. The stationary potential diﬀerence
between the electrodes ∆Φ = 1000 corresponds to a uni-
form background ﬁeld E = −0.5 ez in the z direction.
For nitrogen under normal conditions, this corresponds
to an electrode separation of 5 mm and a potential diﬀer-
ence of 50 kV. The unit of time τ0 is 3 ps, and the unit of
ﬁeld E0 is 200 kV/cm. We use D = 0.1 which is appropri-
ate for nitrogen, and assume cylindrical symmetry. The
radial coordinate extends from the origin up to r = 2000
to avoid lateral boundary eﬀects on the ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tion. As initial condition, we used an electrically neutral
Gaussian ionization seed on the cathode

σ(r, z, t = 0) = ρ(r, z, t = 0) = 10−6 e−(z2+r2)/1002

.
(11)
The parameters of our numerical experiment are es-
sentially the same as in the earlier simulations of Vitello
et al.14, except that our background electric ﬁeld is twice
as high; the earlier work had 25 kV applied over a gap of
5 mm. This corresponded to a dimensionless background
ﬁeld of 0.25, and branching was not observed. Further
details on this simulation can be found in the references.5
There have been some more simulations with improved
numerics and diﬀerent boundary and initial conditions16
where this branching phenomena has been observed.

IV. THE ONE DIMENSIONAL STREAMER
EQUATIONS IN A COMOVING FRAME: THE
PLANAR FRONT

In the previous section some numerical evidence of
branching have been presented. In this section and the
ones to follow we will investigate this issue by analyt-
ical means. Here we will start with the solution for a
stationary planar front. The idea is to ﬁnd a uniformly
translating front and investigate how transversal pertur-
bation of this solution will develop.

For planar fronts, we assume that charge varies only
in the z direction, so using the equations (6)-(9) we can
write

∂tσ − ∂z(σE) − D∂2

z σ − σf (|E|) = 0 ,

∂tρ − σf (|E|) = 0 ,
∂zE − ρ + σ = 0 .

(12)

(13)

Next we will change our reference frame to a frame
moving with velocity v in the z direction (x, y, ξ = z−vt).
Then equations (12) read

∂tσ = v∂ξσ + ∂ξ(σE) + D∂2
∂tρ = v∂ξρ + σf (|E|),
∂ξE − ρ + σ = 0 .

ξ σ + σf (|E|),

A front translating uniformly with velocity v in the
ﬁxed frame is stationary in this comoving frame, ∂tσ =
∂tρ = 0. As a result, the corresponding front proﬁles are
solutions of ordinary diﬀerential equations.

We need to set the boundary conditions. The ﬁeld,
being completely screened in the ionized region, is ap-
proximately constant in space and time far ahead of the
front, so it follows

E =

0
E∞ ˆz , E∞ < 0

(cid:26)

z → −∞
z → +∞

,

(14)

where ˆz is the unit vector in z direction. These bound-
ary conditions imply, that a time independent amount of
charge is travelling within the front, and no currents ﬂow
far behind the front in the ionized regime.

Now,

there
for any nonvanishing far ﬁeld E∞,
is a continuous family of uniformly translating front
solutions,8,17 since the front propagates into an unsta-
ble state.18 In particular, for E∞ > 0 there is a solution
for any velocity v ≥ 0, and for E∞ < 0, there is a so-
lution for any v ≥ |E∞|. These solutions are associated
with an exponentially decaying electron density proﬁle:

an electron proﬁle that asymptotically for large ξ decays
like σ(ξ) ∝ e−λξ with λ ≥ 0.

It will “pull” an ionization front along with the same
speed. (For E∞ > 0, the same equation applies for all
λ ≥ f (E∞)/E∞, hence for v ≥ 0). For the interested
reader we refer him to the bibliography.18

Dynamically, the velocity is selected by the initial elec-
tron proﬁle.8,18 If initially the electron density strictly
vanishes beyond a certain point ξ0 (corresponding to
λ = ∞ above)

σ = 0 = ρ for ξ > ξ0 at t = 0,

(15)

then this will stay true for all times t > 0 in a coordinate
system moving with velocity v = |E∞|, and an ionization
front propagating precisely with the electron drift veloc-
ity |E∞| develops. In the remainder of the paper, we will
consider this particular case.

FIG. 2: Electron density σ, ion density ρ and electric ﬁeld E
for a negative ionization front moving with v = |E∞| in the
comoving frame and. The far ﬁeld is E∞ = −1 and D = 0.1.

In Fig. 2 we have solved (13) with the boundary con-
ditions discussed previously (14) and (15). We have cho-
sen the far ﬁeld E∞ = −1 and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
D = 0.1. It was done using a shooting method for solving
our two point boundary value problem. This technique
consists in choosing values for all of the dependent vari-
ables at one boundary. These values must be consistent
with any boundary conditions for that boundary, but oth-
erwise are arranged to depend on arbitrary free parame-
ters whose values we initially randomly guess. We then
integrate the ODEs by initial value methods, arriving at
the other boundary.
In general, we ﬁnd discrepancies
from the desired boundary values there. Now we adjust
the free parameters at the starting point that zeros the
discrepancies at the other boundary. The idea is to iter-
ate this procedure until obtaining the desired accuracy.
There is a nice pedestrian explanation of solving bound-
ary value problems by shooting in Numerical Recipes.19

V. SHOCK FRONTS

In this section we will simplify a bit more our model
by taking the limit D → 0. For negative fronts, the
limit D → 0 is smooth and eliminates the algebraic
relaxation.18 It also reduces the order of the equations.
We therefore make D = 0 in the streamer equations.
Then, in the comoving frame, using (13) we can write for
a stationary front

v∂ξσ + ∂ξ(σE) + σf (|E|) = 0,
v∂ξρ + σf (|E|) = 0,
∂ξE − ρ + σ = 0 .

(16)
(17)
(18)

We can solve this system analytically. If we take the
(17) and subtract it from (16), using (18) to eliminate
σ − ρ, we get

− v∂ξE + σE = 0.

(19)

This equation is just a consequence of the charge conser-
vation. We can see this by writing ∂tq + ∇ · jtot = 0, with
the total charge deﬁned as q = ρ − σ. In our model, each
ionizing collision, produces the same number of negative
and positive charge, so we end with ∇·jtot = 0. The total
current is given by jtot = ∂tE+σE and for a planar front
with constant and time independent ﬁeld E = E∞ ˆz (13)
in the non-ionized region where σ = 0, the total current
jtot = jtot(t)ˆz vanishes. In the comoving frame of Eqs.
(13) and (16)–(18), this means (19).

The front equations now reduce to two ordinary diﬀer-

ential equations for σ and E

∂ξ[(v + E)σ] = −σf (E) , f (E) = |E|α(E) ,

v∂ξ ln |E| = σ,

This gives us σ and ρ as functions of E, and the space

equation.

We have plotted in Fig. 3 the solutions (21)–(23) for a
shock front moving with v = 1. We have chosen ξ1 = 0
and then E(ξ1) = E∞

and then forming “ripples” or “corrugations” on that sur-
face. In that case, we will be interested in obtaining the
dispersion relation curve to ﬁnd which mode will grow
faster and eventually determine the streamer character-
istic shape. Here we will derive the perturbed equations
and the boundary conditions.

Let the planar shock front which propagates into the
z direction receive a slight perturbation having an arbi-
trary dependence on the transversal coordinates x and y.
Within linear perturbation theory, they can be decom-
posed into Fourier modes. Therefore we need the growth
rate s(k) of an arbitrary transversal Fourier mode to pre-
dict the evolution of an arbitrary perturbation. Because
of isotropy within the transversal (x, y)-plane, we can re-
strict the analysis to Fourier modes in the x direction, so
we study linear perturbations ∝ exp(st + ikx). The no-
tation anticipates the exponential growth of such modes.
Any perturbation will also lead to a perturbation of the
position of the ionization shock front. So we will intro-
duce the new variable ζ = ξ − ǫ exp(ikx + st) and the
ansatz

σ(x, ζ, t) = σ0(ζ) + ǫ σ1(ζ) eikx+st,
ρ(x, ζ, t) = ρ0(ζ) + ǫ ρ1(ζ) eikx+st,
φ(x, ζ, t) = φ0(ζ) + ǫ φ1(ζ) eikx+st,

(24)

namely

where σ0, ρ0 and φ0 are the electron density, ion density
and electric potential of the planar ionization shock front
obtained in the previous section. Note, however, that
these planar solutions are shifted to the position of the
perturbed front. Substitution of these expressions into
(13) (with D = 0) gives to leading order in the small
parameter ǫ

Note we have introduce an auxiliary ﬁeld ψ1 = ∂ζφ1
which coincides with the correction for the electric ﬁeld
sign reversed to order ǫ.

Having obtained the linear order perturbation equa-
tions, we are now in position to discuss boundary con-
ditions. First we consider the boundary conditions at
ζ = 0. There are two types of boundary conditions,
some arising from the boundedness of densities to the
left of the shock front at ζ ↑ 0, and some arising from
the continuity of ﬁelds across the position ζ = 0 of the
shock front. From (16) we gather that (v + E) ∂zσ
is ﬁnite for all z, also for z ↑ 0 and for z = 0, since
(v + E) ∂zσ = σ (σ − ρ − f ) is ﬁnite. The same is true
l
for σ0. In particular,
−l dz (v + E) ∂zσ0 → 0 as l → 0,
and (v + E) ∂zσ0 → 0 as z ↑ 0.
R

Therefore we impose the same conditions for σ1,

dζ (v + E) ∂ζσ1 = 0

(v + E) ∂ζσ1 = 0

(28)

(29)

In a second step we are going to make use of the con-
tinuity conditions. We match the ζ < 0 solution to
the ζ > 0 solution. As in front of the shock there are
not sources, one has to solve ∇2φ = 0 for ζ > 0 and
∇φ = −E∞ ˆz = v ˆz when ζ → ∞. The solution to ﬁrst
order in ǫ has the form

σ = 0
ρ = 0
φ = a + vζ + ǫ(v + b e−kζ) eikx+st

for ζ > 0 (30)

with the undetermined integration constants a and b.

Now ρ and ∇φ have to be continuous across the shock
front: ∇φ is continuous because the charge density ρ − σ
is ﬁnite everywhere. The continuity of ρ we get from (17)
and the fact, that σ and |E| are bounded for all z.

From the continuity of ρ turns out

ρ(x, ζ+, t) − ρ(x, ζ−, t)

= 0

lim
ζ→0 (cid:16)

(cid:17)

⇒ ρ1(0) = 0

(31)

where we have use (30) and (24) to the right and left
limits.

implies that

Using expressions (30) and (24) again, these conditions

ψ1(0) = −kb

,

φ1(0) = v + b

(33)

If we impose the continuity of the potential, we get
a = φ0(0) and φ1(0) = v + b (which is the same condition
obtained from the continuity of the electric ﬁeld).

Finally, from (28) and (29), and taking into account

that f = σ0 when ζ → 0, we have

ψ1(0) = s

σ1(0) =

we can ﬁnd a solution for the transversal perturbation
equations (26) fulﬁlling the boundary conditions derived
previously (35) and (36). In general, an analytic treat-
ment for any value of k is not possible and one has to
resort to numerical calculations.20 However, in the limits
of small and large wave number the equations simplify
and we can obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the dis-
persion relation s(k).

We will start looking at the small k-limit. If expres-
sions (26) and (27) are evaluated only up to ﬁrst order
in k, then φ1 decouples, and we get

Consider now the limit s ≪ f (v). Then Eqs. (37)
and (40) up to order s/f (v) become identical to the per-
turbed equations obtained from an inﬁnitesimal change
of E∞. If we compare two uniformly translating fronts
with inﬁnitesimally diﬀerent ﬁeld E∞ at identical posi-
tions, their linearised diﬀerence solves the same equa-
tions. In this case, ψ1 is independent of s and k. But
then (42) implies

s = vk + O(k2)

for k ≪ α(v) .

VIII. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

(44)

(45)

(46)

This result also has an immediate physical interpre-
tation: 1/k is the largest length scale involved.
It is
much larger than the thickness of the screening charge
layer. Therefore the charge layer can be contracted to a
δ-function contribution along an interface line. Such a
screening charged interface precisely has the instability
mode s = vk.

In the opposite limit, when k becomes large enough, we
can also ﬁnd a relation for the dispersion curve. We will
need to make the assumption that the ion and electron
densities remain bounded. Taking this into account, we
can write using (26) the equations for ψ1 and φ1 as

∂ζψ1 ≃ k2 (φ1 + E) ,
∂ζφ1 = ψ1

On the short length scale 1/k, the unperturbed electric
ﬁeld for ζ < 0 can be approximated making an asymp-
totic expansion of (21)–(23) by20

Inserting this expression in (44), we obtain

ζ φ1 = k2
∂2

φ1 − v − f (v)ζ

.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

The boundary condition (35) ﬁxes φ1(0) = (vk − s)/k
and ψ1(0) = ∂ζφ1 = s. The unique solution of (46) with
these initial conditions is

φ1(ζ) = v + f (v)ζ −

f (v)
2k

ekζ +

f (v) − 2s
2k

e−kζ

(47)

for ζ < 0. Now the mode e−kζ would increase rapidly
towards decreasing ζ, create diverging electric ﬁelds in
the ionized region and could not be balanced by any other
terms in the equations. Therefore it has to be absent.
The demand that its coeﬃcient (f (v) − 2s)/2k vanishes,
ﬁxes the dispersion relation

s(k) =

+ O

for k ≫ α(v) .

(cid:18)

Again there is a simple physical interpretation of this
growth rate. The electric ﬁeld can be approximated in
leading order by

E(x, ζ, t) ≃

−ˆz
v + f (v)ζ
−ˆz v
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(cid:26)

for ζ > 0

will grow with rate ∂ζE. The averaged slope of the ﬁeld
for ζ > 0 and ζ < 0 is ∂ζE = f (v)/2, and this is precisely
the growth rate (48) determined above.

We have studied the (in)stability of planar negative
ionization fronts against linear perturbations and we have
found

s(k) =

|E∞| k
|E∞| α(|E∞|)/2

(cid:26)

for k ≪ α(|E∞|)
for k ≫ α(|E∞|)

(50)

So the planar front becomes unstable with a linear
growth rate s(k) for small k to a saturation value
|E∞| α(|E∞|)/2. This gives us a mechanism for branch-
ing. In the case of a curved front, if the radius of cur-
vature increases, the planar approximation for the tip
is sensible and allows a qualitative understanding of the
branching phenomena.

In this paper a fully deterministic model for stream-
ers, without photoionization, which is suitable for nonat-
taching gases like nitrogen has been presented. We have
proposed that an anode directed front can branch sponta-
neously according to this model due to Laplacian interfa-
cial instability. We have shown some numerical evidence
of this phenomena. We have studied the stability of a pla-
nar front and how transversal perturbation would grow.
This gives us a qualitative picture of the mechanism act-
ing on a curved front, and we have got the asymptotic
behaviour of the dispersion curve.

However, some questions remain to be answered. From
the dispersion curve any short enough wave length in-
stability will grow. We do expect that a regularization
mechanism should come into play. This regularization
mechanism which selects a particular mode could be the
electric screening due to curvature. In the present it is
under investigation.20 Other possibility could be the dif-
fusion phenomena not considered in the shock front case.
Diﬀusion was neglected to prevent mathematical chal-
lenges, but soon or later one has to face challenges.

In any case, the physics of low temperature plasmas
is an area where many fundamental questions are still
open, where ideas from patter formation, electrodynam-
ics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and non-
linear mathematics can be applied, and where the exper-
imental side has been ahead of the theoretical one. When
I hear some pessimistic voices for the future of physics, I
always think there is much room at the bottom...

Abstract

It is shown that penetration of relativistically intense laser light into an overdense
plasma, accessible by self-induced transparency, occurs over a ﬁnite length only. The pen-
etration length depends crucially on the overdense plasma parameter and increases with
increasing incident intensity after exceeding the threshold for self-induced transparency.
Exact analytical solutions describing the plasma-ﬁeld distributions are presented.

In the past few years there has been much research devoted to the nonlinear interaction of
superintense laser pulses with plasmas [1]. At intensities where electrons quiver with relativistic
velocities, the interaction can be characterized as nonlinear optics in relativistic plasmas, and
new regimes, not evident at nonrelativistic intensities, may appear. As was previously shown,
superintense electromagnetic radiation can propagate through a classically overdense plasma
due to the relativistic correction to the electron mass, the so called induced transparency eﬀect,
[2]-[10]. The present work has resulted in the identiﬁcation of a new fundamental process in
relativistic laser overdense plasma interaction.

In order to understand the nonlinear regime of interaction of superintense laser light with
an overdense plasma, it is enough, without loss of generality, to consider a stationary model.
We present here a new class of exact analytical solutions describing the penetration of an
electromagnetic wave normally incident onto a cold, overdense plasma with a sharp boundary.
In particular, we show that, when the incident intensity exceeds the threshold for self-induced
transparency, the laser energy penetrates into the dense plasma without any losses, but over a
ﬁnite length only. At the same time, the electron density distribution becomes structured as a
sequence of electron layers separated by about half a wavelength wide depleted regions, so that
this strongly nonlinear plasma structure acts as a distributed Bragg reﬂector.

The ultrahigh intensity laser-plasma interaction is described by the relativistic equation
of motion and the equation of continuity for the electrons together with Maxwell’s equations.
Ions are treated as a uniform neutralizing background. We will consider circularly polarized
laser radiation with normalized amplitude of the vector potential eA/mc2 = (a/√2)Re[(y +
iz)exp(iωt)] normally incident from vacuum (x < 0) onto a semi-inﬁnite plasma (x ≥ 0).
Assuming a stationary regime, the basic equations may be written in the form

of the plasma respectively). Eq. (3) indicates that only in the region where the electron density
n(x) 6= 0 the ponderomotive force, γ ′(x), must be compensated by the force of a longitudinal
ﬁeld. This statement will be important for constructing solutions of interest in the present
analysis.

For homogeneous ion density, the system has the following Hamiltonian

HE =

1

2(1 + a2)

a′2 −

2

(2no√1 + a2 − a2)

(4)

which was analyzed in [5].

As we are interested in a semi-inﬁnite plasma, we ﬁrst consider the case when n(x) → 1

and both a(x) and a′(x) vanish as x → ∞. In this case the integral of motion equals

HE = −no ≡ H0.

(5)

Eq. (4) can then easily be integrated to yield the following single-parametric solitary solution

a(x) =

Am coshh|ε0|1/2(x − x(0))i
no cosh2 [|ε0|1/2(x − x(0))] − |ε0|

(6)

where ε0 = 1 − no is the dielectric permittivity of the plasma and the parameter x(0) deﬁnes
the position of the maximum of the function (6) which is given by Am = 2[no(no − 1)]1/2.
For no > 1.5 this solution contains a region where the electron density is negative, which is
clearly unphysical. Requiring the minimum electron density nm = 1− 4(no − 1)2 to be positive,
i.e. nm ≥ 0, we obtain a condition on the background plasma density and an argument in
favor of the depletion region: for no > 1.5 we have to take into account only that part of the
solution where the corresponding electron density is positive, n(x) ≥ 0.By using the part of the
solution (6) corresponding to a ponderomotive force that pushes electrons into the plasma and
matching it to the vacuum one, an exact expression for the intensity threshold of self-induced
transparency was found, [11]. It should be noted that the Hamiltonian (5) corresponds to a
zero energy ﬂux, but there are solutions with non-zero ﬂux as well, [2, 6]. They can arise even
in correspondence to incident amplitudes smaller than the penetration threshold. However, for
the realization of such nonlinear hysteresis-like solutions, [10, 12], preliminary modiﬁcations of
the plasma must be induced by extremely intense ﬁelds. For the description of the steady-state
of a problem involving laser radiation with turn-on shape it is natural to choose the zero ﬂux
approach.

The left side of the function (6) gives rise to an unbalanced ponderomotive force pulling
electrons out of the plasma towards the incident wave and, at ﬁrst glance, it seems that the
charge quasineutrality condition cannot be satisﬁed. However, after a length of about half a
wavelength, these electrons will be stopped by the ponderomotive force acting in the opposite
direction. Thus, in the general case, we may expect that the full plasma-ﬁeld structure will
consist of a sequence of alternating depletion and nondepletion regions. This can be understood
from Fig. 1, where the phase portraits described by Eqs (1)-(3)and by the corresponding
equation for the depletion (vacuum) region are presented. For a half-space plasma the limiting
case corresponds to a motion with inﬁnite period along the separatrix determined by Eq. (5),
i.e., an exponentially decreasing ﬁeld inside the overdense plasma. Going backwards towards
the initial vacuum-plasma boundary, before the last semi-inﬁnite electron layer there must exist

2

a depletion region. Here the amplitude of the ﬁeld corresponds to a forward going wave along
the incident direction with an intensity below the threshold value (corresponding to the motion
along the ﬁrst circular trajectory in phase space, coming from the vacuum Hamiltonian). Then,
in front of this layer we have to put another electron layer, where the solution for the ﬁeld a(x)
follows from the Hamiltonian (4) with a magnitude H > −no (corresponding to an oscillatory
motion about zero). This construction is repeated until the initial plasma boundary is reached.
At the boundary between each depletion and nondepletion region, the solution for the ﬁeld
must satisfy continuity conditions for both a and its derivative a′. It is also clear that there
exists a family of stationary solutions that diﬀer from each other by the number of electron
density layers and their shapes. When the incident amplitude is increased, the number of layers
will increase as well, as follows from the phase portraits in Fig. 1.

In order to quantify the above discussion, we present a more rigorous analytical description.
Starting from inside the plasma region, the solution for the ﬁeld is an exponentially decreasing
function of the spatial coordinate, in fact a part of the localized solution given by Eq. (6) with
HE = H0 for x0 ≤ x < ∞. The point x = x0 can be determined self-consistently from the
global solution and the boundary conditions

a(x = x0) = a0, a′(x = x0) = a′
0

(7)

The next region (x1 < x < x0) must be a depletion layer where n(x) = 0. The second
boundary position of this depletion layer, x1, must also be determined self-consistently. The
Hamiltonian here is the vacuum one and reads

HV =

(a′2 + a2) =

(a′2

(8)

where we have taken into account the boundary conditions for the ﬁeld and its ﬁrst derivative.
The solution of the ﬁeld in this depletion region reads

a(x) = A1 cos(x + ψ1).

(9)

Using (7) we have: A1 = (a′2
0/a0) − x0. The boundary
position x1can be calculated by integrating Poisson’s equation within the interval x1 < x < x0:

0)1/2 = (2H1)1/2, ψ1 = − arctan(a′

0 + a2

which, together with relation (3), leads to a transcendental equation for ξ = x0 − x1:

φ′(x0) − φ′(x1) = −no(x0 − x1).

where

g(ξ) =

ξ = g(ξ) − g(0)

(10)

(11)

(12)

Since the left-hand side of Eq. (11) is a linear function while its right-hand side is a periodic

function of ξ, this equation has a non-trivial solution only if g ′(ξ = −ξ1) > 1, i.e.

g ′(ξ = −ξ1) =

A2

no(1 + A2

1)1/2 > 1.

(13)

However, if no ≤ 1.5, this condition is never satisﬁed, because its maximum value reaches one at
no = 1.5. Consequently, for plasma densities no ≤ 1.5 we conclude that there are no stationary

3

regimes of anomalous penetration: there can only exist dynamical solutions. For no > 1.5,
Eq. (11) always has non-trivial solutions, which can be found numerically. Formally, Eq. (11)
admits several roots but we have to consider only those that correspond to a positive electron
density.

Having solved Eq.(11) we know a1 = a(x1) and a′

1 = a′(x1). The next region must again be

an electron layer. Denoting this region as x2 ≤ x ≤ x1, the Hamiltonian (4) will here be

HE = HE(a1, a′

1) ≡ H2.

(14)

with the corresponding ﬁeld solution written in terms of two-parameter elliptic functions for
the ﬁeld strength as

(15)

The two parameters, ε2 and x(2) are determined by the boundary conditions at x = x1. Here
ε2 = (n2
o + 1 + 2H2)1/2, q = [(ε2 + no)2 − 1]1/2 and ¯q = [(ε2 + no + 1)/(ε2 + no − 1)]1/2,

about a quarter period, where the electron density is positive and is given by

The second boundary position of this layer can now be deﬁned with a certain arbitrariness,
namely, it can be taken within the whole interval x∗ ≤ x2 ≤ x∗∗, where x∗ is such that n(x∗) = 0,
while x∗∗ is deﬁned by the existence of a solution of the transcendental equation (11). This
problem comes up for every layer, therefore the global solution, for a given incident amplitude,
in general may not be unique because the thickness of each plasma layer is not uniquely ﬁxed,
the realization of each speciﬁc solution depending on the prehistory of the process. This is also
conﬁrmed by our preliminary simulations based on a hydrodynamics approach where, at ﬁxed
incident amplitude, the thickness of the various electron layers in the quasi-stationary stage is
quite diﬀerent depending on the turn-on shape of the incident radiation. The appearance of
non-unique solutions is typical of phenomena involving nonlinear media (see, for instance, [12]).
For the sake of concreteness, in what follows, we choose the next boundary position x2 as
the point where the electron density vanishes, i.e. n(x2) = 0. In this case, the transcendental
equation (11) always has nontrivial solutions because, if the condition given by Eq.
(13)
is satisﬁed for the semi-inﬁnite layer, it will automatically be satisﬁed for all the precedent
electron layers, for the point where the electron density vanishes.
As follows from (16), the ﬁeld at this boundary is such that

3no(1 + a2

2)1/2 = 2(a2

2 − H2)

(17)

and, making use of the equation for the Hamiltonian (14), we can calculate the ﬁrst derivative of
the ﬁeld. Thus, for the next depletion layer located within x3 < x < x2, we know the boundary
values of a2 and a′
2 that are required to generate a solution by using the same procedure as
before for x1 < x < x0. This procedure is repeated for every layer, xi+1 < x < xi, up to the
ﬁnal layer and if Hi > no, the ﬁeld solution has to be taken as in the second expression of (15).

The last layer will be a depletion region 0 < x < xN where x = 0 is the real plasma-vacuum
boundary. At this point the electric ﬁeld due to charge separation must vanish. Integrating
Poisson’s equation over the plasma interval, the plasma neutrality condition gives

which deﬁnes the last free parameter. Thus, matching the solution for the ﬁeld to the vacuum
solution at the electron layer boundary x = xN we can relate the obtained plasma-ﬁeld distri-
bution to the incident electromagnetic wave. In this way we can construct an exact stationary
solution for the anomalous penetration regime. An example of such a solution is presented in
Fig. 2. Notice that the maximum of the electron density in a layer increases from layer to
layer, reaching an absolute maximum in the last layer nearest to the vacuum boundary while
the width of the layers become more and more narrow. This may easily be understood from
Fig. 1; higher lying trajectories have higher values of the integrals of motion. It also means
that at higher incident wave amplitudes there are more layers, so that the penetration length
will increase with increasing incident intensity. These solutions can naturally be extended to
cover the case of plasma slabs with ﬁnite thickness, if the penetration length is smaller than
the slab thickness.

The following consequence of the previous analysis should be emphasized: For a ﬁxed am-
plitude the laser ﬁeld penetrates only a ﬁnite length into the overdense plasma. Consequently,
if the incident laser pulse has a ﬁnite duration, the electromagnetic energy deposited in the
plasma will be reﬂected back into the vacuum after the laser ﬁeld has vanished. Evidently the
transient regime will be more complicated as vacuum (depletion) regions surrounded by elec-
tron layers will show a resonator-like behaviour, with the electromagnetic energy being excited
by the incident pulse. We expect this ﬁeld structure to evolve and to be slowly reﬂected back
into the vacuum region.

In conclusion, we have presented a new class of exact analytical stationary solutions describ-
ing a new feature of the interaction between a super-intense laser and an overdense plasma.
This analysis shows how, depending on the initial plasma density, the interaction might result
in the generation of a new plasma-ﬁeld structure consisting of alternating electron and ”vac-
uum” regions, with the electromagnetic energy penetrating into the overdense plasma over a
ﬁnite length determined by the incident intensity.

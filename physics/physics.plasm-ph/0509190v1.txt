Abstract.

Real-time thermal ﬁeld theory is used to reveal the structure of plasma corrections
to nuclear reactions. Previous results are recovered in a fashion that clariﬁes their
nature, and new extensions are made. Brown and Yaﬀe have introduced the methods
of eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theory into plasma physics They are used here to treat the
interesting limiting case of dilute but very highly charged particles reacting in a dilute,
one-component plasma. The highly charged particles are very strongly coupled to this
background plasma. The eﬀective ﬁeld theory proves that this mean ﬁeld solution plus
the one-loop term dominate; higher loop corrections are negligible even though the
problem involves strong coupling. Such analytic results for very strong coupling are
rarely available, and they can serve as benchmarks for testing computer models.

1. General Formulation

A nuclear reaction, which we schematically indicate by 1 + 2 → 3 + 4, takes place over a
very short distance in comparison with particle separations in a plasma. Hence, it can
be described by an eﬀective local Hamiltonian density

H(x, t) = g K(x, t) + g K†(x, t) .

The operator K describes, with interaction strength g, the destruction of the initial
particles and the creation of the ﬁnal particles; the operator K† does the reverse. Fermi’s
golden rule presents the rate as

The angular brackets h· · ·iβ denote the thermal average; Q is the reaction energy release.
The extension of imaginary time thermodynamic theory to include real time
behavior was initiated long ago by Schwinger [1] and Keldysh [2]. Using this method as
a basis, a detailed analysis [3] shows that when the particles entering into the nuclear
reaction can be treated by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics,

All the ﬁeld variables ψ in the plasma Lagrangian L and plasma charge density ρ are
functions of the spatial coordinate y, and the generalized time variable s runs along the
contour C shown in Fig. 1. The reacting particles have thermal wave lengths λ1,2 and,
with no plasma interactions, they would have number densities n(0)
1,2.

The structure of the result (3) is easy to understand. The two transformation
functions h· · · | · · ·iVC φ describe the propagation of the initial and ﬁnal particles that
undergo the nuclear reaction. The VC superscripts indicate that these particles interact
via their mutual Coulomb forces. The φ superscripts indicate that these particles also
interact with an arbitrary external potential. The operator ˆZC
produces the
Coulomb interactions between the reacting particles and the background plasma.

Here ΓC is the nuclear reaction rate for a thermal, Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of
the initial (1,2) particles at temperature T but with no plasma background. The rate ΓC
does contain the full eﬀects of the Coulomb forces between the reacting particles. The
number N (0)
is the particle number obtained for a free gas grand canonical ensemble
with chemical potential µa. The number Na is the particle number of this species a with
the same chemical potential µa but now interacting in the plasma. The subscripts 1 + 2
denote a composite particle of charge (Z1 + Z2)e.

2. Method Illustrated By Improving The Ion Sphere Model

The simplest example has a weakly interacting one-component plasma, g ≪ 1, where
g = βe2κ/4π . The eﬀective ﬁeld theory of Brown and Yaﬀe [6] shows that

The normalizing partition function Z is deﬁned by the functional integral whose action
omits the δ function term in Eq. (7). The tree approximation is given by S[iφcl(r)] with

This is the familiar Debye-Huckle form, but now placed in a systematic perturbative
expansion where error can be ascertained. Including the one-loop correction gives

We work in the limit where Zp is so large that gZp ≫ 1. The point charge Zpe/4πr
part of φcl(r) is large and dominates over a large range. This validates the Salpeter ion

The ﬁrst correction to the leading Salpeter solution can also be computed in analytic
form except for a numerical integral. Including this correction gives, with C = 0.8498 · · ·,

In our limit the term κ2 exp {−βeφ(r)} in the one-loop determinant can be treated as
being very slowly varying except when it appears in a ﬁnal volume integral. Thus,

This result is physically obvious. The ion of high Zp carves out a hole of radius r0 in
the original plasma. The original plasma is unchanged outside this hole. Corrections
smooth out the sharp boundaries and produce only higher-order terms. The original
plasma had a vanishing electrostatic potential everywhere, and the potential in the ion
sphere picture now vanishes outside the sphere of radius r0. Thus the thermodynamic
potential of the plasma is reduced by the amount that was originally contained within the
sphere of radius r0, and this is exactly what is stated to one-loop order in Eq.(12). This
argument carries on to the higher loop terms as well. A term involving n loops carries
a factor gn. The presence of the impurity modiﬁes this to be Zgn. With g suﬃciently
small, all the higher-order loops make negligible contributions. The corrected impurity
number Np is hence given by Eq’s. (12) and (10) inserted into Eq. (9).

The number relation expresses the nuclear rate (5) in terms of the tree contribution.

The ﬁrst line agrees with the calculation of Salpeter [7]; the second is a new correction.
The number correction for the number of impurity ions Np placed in the weakly
coupled background plasma with number N can be used to construct the grand canonical
partition function Z for the combined system by integrating the generic relation
N = ∂ ln Z/∂βµ . To simply bring out the main point, we now include only the leading
terms. Standard thermodynamic relations then lead to the equation of state

Although Np/N may be small, there is a large pressure modiﬁcation if Zp is large.

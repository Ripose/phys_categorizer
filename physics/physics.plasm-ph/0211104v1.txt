In order to achieve a high quality, i. e. monoergetic, intense ion beam, we propose the use of a
double layer target. The ﬁrst layer, at the target front, consists of high-Z atoms, while the second
(rear) layer is a thin coating of low-Z atoms. The high quality proton beams from the double
layer target, irradiated by an ultra-intense laser pulse, are demonstrated with three dimensional
Particle-in-Cell simulations.

The high eﬃciency of ion acceleration recently ob-
served in the interaction of petawatt laser pulses [1] with
solid targets [2] has lead to important applications such
as the use of laser produced fast ion beam injection to
conventional accelerators (see Ref. [3]), the fast ignition
[4], and
of thermonuclear targets, as discussed in Refs.
hadrontherapy in oncology [5]. Laser accelerated protons
have been used for proton imaging of small scale objects
in laser produced plasmas with high time resolution [6].
The process of ion acceleration has been studied in de-
tail with multi-dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simu-
lations [7]. In the recent experimental results presented
in Refs.
[2], electron energy in a range of hundreds of
MeV was observed, while the proton energy was about
tens of MeV with a number of fast protons from 1012
to 1013 per pulse and with the transformation of 12%
of the laser energy into fast ion energy. In Refs.
[7] it
was shown with PIC simulations that, by optimizing the
laser-target parameters, it becomes possible to accelerate
protons up to several hundreds MeV with a number of
fast ions approximately 1013 particles per pulse.

FIG. 1: Electric ﬁeld near the target is shown as the 3D vector
ﬁeld, the length of each vector corresponds to the magnitude
of electric ﬁeld. Vectors with |eEx/(meωc)| ≤ 1 are violet.
The laser pulse is presented by isosurfaces of the transverse
component Ez corresponding to dimensionless values ±10.
The time unit is the laser period 2π/ω.

FIG. 2: Plasma species. The envelopes of heavy ions (thick
red shell) and light ions (thin blue shell) are shown. Electron
density is shown as a ‘green gas’ using ray tracing technique.

The typical energy spectrum of laser accelerated par-
ticles observed both in the experiments and in the
computer simulations can be approximated by a quasi-
thermal distribution with a cut-oﬀ at a maximum en-
ergy
Emax. The eﬀective temperature T , that may be at-
tributed to the fast ion beams, is much less than the max-
imal energy. On the other hand, almost all above men-
tioned applications require high quality proton beams,
i.e., beams with suﬃciently small energy spread ∆

ultra-intense laser pulse is incident on the ﬁrst layer, and
so we say that the ﬁrst layer is at the target front, while
the second layer is at the rear side of the target. We use
the term ‘longitudinal’ for the direction of propagation
of the laser pulse, and the term ‘transverse’ for perpen-
dicular directions.

When an ultra-intense laser pulse irradiates the target,
heavy atoms are partly ionized and electrons are expelled
from the foil. A quasi-static electric ﬁeld is generated
due to charge separation. The ﬁrst layer of heavy ions
(the foil) should be suﬃciently thick so as to produce a
large enough quasi-static electric ﬁeld, and, at the same
time, it should be suﬃciently thin to be able to produce
strong electric ﬁeld at the rear side. Such an electric
ﬁeld has opposite signs on the two sides of the target,
and vanishes inside the target and at some ﬁnite distance
from it. The number of low-Z ions in the second layer (the
coating) should be suﬃciently small not to produce any
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the electric ﬁeld. The quasi-static
electric ﬁeld accelerates both high-Z ions (with average
charge eZi) and low-Z ions (with average charge eZa).
If the ratio miZa/(maZi) is suﬃciently large, light ions
are accelerated much more eﬃciently than heavy ones.
The coated thin layer can be then accelerated forward.
It detaches from the foil, and moves as a whole in the
longitudinal direction. The light ions within a small solid
angle have a quasi-monoenergetic energy spectrum. The
thinner the coating the narrower energy spectrum of light
ions is.

The important requirement is that the transverse size
of the coating must be smaller than the laser waist since
an inhomogeneity in the laser pulse causes nonuniform
accelerating electric ﬁeld and thus a degradation of beam
quality, as seen in experiments presented in Refs.
[2]
where the exposed targets had a thin proton layer on
their surface. The laser pulse inhomogeneity results in
an additional energy spread of the ion beam as seen in
the experiments. The eﬀect of the ﬁnite waist of the laser
pulse leads also to an undesirable defocusing of the fast
In order to compensate for this eﬀect and
ion beam.
to focus the ion beam, we can use properly deformed
targets, as suggested in Refs. [7, 11].

In a target, whose transverse size is much greater than
the laser focal spot, quasi-static electric ﬁeld can be af-
fected by background ‘cold’ electrons from the periphery.
To increase the quality and life-time of the quasi-static
electric ﬁeld, we should use targets with transverse size
less than the laser waist.

In order to estimate the typical energy gain of fast
ions, we assume that the main portion of the free elec-
trons produced by ionization in the irradiated region of
the foil are expelled.
In this case the generated elec-
tric ﬁeld near the positively charged layer is equal to
E0 = 2πn0eZil. Here n0 is the ion density and eZi is
an average ion electric charge in the foil, and l is the
foil thickness. The region of strong electric ﬁeld has a

vide the conditions for a high irradiation dose being deliv-
ered to the tumor saving neighboring healthy tissues [8].
In the concept of Fast Ignition with laser accelerated ions
presented in Refs. [4], the proton beam was assumed to
be quasi-monoenergetic. An analysis carried out in Ref.
[9] has shown that the Fast Ignition with a quasi-thermal
beam of fast protons requires several times larger energy
than that with a monoenergetic beam. Similarly, in the
case of the injector (see Ref. [3]), a high-quality beam is
needed in order to inject the charged particles into the
optimal accelerating phase eﬃciently. Thus we see that
the generation of high quality beams is a key problem for
many applications. However energy spectra of the laser
accelerated ions at present are rather far from required
ones.

In this Letter we show with three dimensional (3D)
PIC simulations that such a required beam of laser ac-
celerated ions can be obtained using a double layer target
(see also Refs. [5]). Multi layer targets have been used for
a long time in order to increase the eﬃciency of the laser
energy conversion into plasma and fast particle kinetic
energy (see Refs.
In contrast to the conﬁgu-
rations discussed previously, we propose to use a double
layer target to produce fast proton beams with controlled
quality.

in [10]).

In the proposed scheme the target is made of two lay-
ers. The ﬁrst layer consists of high-Z atoms (atomic mass
mi), while the second layer is a very thin coating of low-
Z atoms (atomic mass ma). Such the target can be a
metal foil coated with a thin hydrogeneous ﬁlm. An

transverse size of the order of the diameter 2R⊥ of the
focal spot. Thus the longitudinal size of the region where
the electric ﬁeld remains essentially one-dimensional is of
the order of R⊥ and the typical energy of an ion with
charge eZa accelerated by this electric ﬁeld can be es-
max = 2πn0ZaZie2lR⊥. We have assumed
timated as
that the electron energy in the laser ﬁeld is well above
the ion energy and larger than the energy required for the
electrons to leave the irradiated region. The maximum
electron energy in the electromagnetic wave is given by
e = mea2/2, where a = eE/(mecω) is the dimensionless

amplitude of the laser pulse. From this condition we can
ﬁnd the required value of the laser pulse intensity and its
power.

Consider a double layer target in the form of a prolate
ellipsoid coated at the rear side with a very thin proton
layer. We assume that ellipsoid semiaxes are R⊥ and l/2.
We can estimate the energy spectrum of protons, using
formulae for the electric ﬁeld of the electrically charged
prolate ellipsoid [13]. Let the x-axis be in the longitu-
dinal direction, originating from the target center. On
this axis the x-component of the electric ﬁeld is given by
Ex(x) = (E0/3)R2
(l/2)2 + x2). The distribution
function of the fast protons f (x, v, t) obeys the kinetic
equation ∂tf + v∂xf + (eE(x)/mp) ∂vf = 0. If particles
trajectories do not intersect or self-intersect (for our ellip-
soidal target this it true), we have f (x, v, t) = f0(x0, v0),
where f0(x0, v0) is the distribution function at the ini-
tial time t = 0. The number of particles per unit vol-
ume in phase space, dxdv, is equal to dn = f dxdv =
f vdvdt = f d
dt/mp. We assume that at t = 0 all
particles are at rest and that their spatial distribution
is given by n0(x0) which corresponds to the distribu-
tion function f0(x0, v0) = n0(x0)δ(v0), with δ(v0) the
Dirac delta function. For the applications discussed in
this paper we are interested in the particle distribu-
tion function integrated over time. Time integration
of the distribution f vdvdt gives the energy spectrum of

As we can see, in the vicinity of the target the elec-
tric ﬁeld on the axis is homogeneous and equals to
Ex(l/2) = 2πn0Ziel/3. Therefore, the form of the en-

In order to take into account the numerous nonlinear
and kinetic eﬀects as well as to extend our consideration
to a multidimensional geometry, we performed numerical
simulations of the proton acceleration during the inter-
action of a short, high power laser pulse with a two-layer
target. We used the three dimensional massively parallel
and fully vectorized code REMP (Relativistic Electro-
Magnetic Particle-mesh code) [14]. In these simulations

The plasma consists of three species: electrons, protons
with mp/me = 1836, and heavy ions (gold with Zi = +2)
1836/2.
with mi/meZi = 195.4
The ﬁrst layer (gold) is placed at x = 5.5λ. It has the
form of a disk with diameter 10λ and thickness 0.5λ. The
second layer (protons) also has the form of a disk with
diameter 5λ and thickness 0.03λ, and is placed at the
rear of the ﬁrst layer, at x = 6λ. The electron density in
the heavy ion layer corresponds to the ratio ωpe/ω = 3.0
between the plasma and the laser frequencies, for the
proton layer it corresponds to ωpe/ω = 0.53. The number
of electrons in the ﬁrst layer is approximately 2000 times
larger than that in the proton layer.

The simulation results are shown in Figs. 1 to 3, where
the coordinates are measured in wave lengths of the laser
light and the time in laser periods. In Fig. 1 we present
the electric ﬁeld inside the computation box, to show the
shape of the transmitted laser pulse and the longitudinal
electric ﬁeld accelerating the protons. The electric ﬁeld is
shown as a three-dimensional vector ﬁeld; it is localized
in the vicinity of the ﬁrst layer (the layer of heavy ions) of
the target and can be described as an electrostatic ﬁeld
from a positively charged disk. The transmitted laser
pulse is presented by the isosurfaces of constant value of
the z-component of the electric ﬁeld. In Fig. 2 we show
the densities of plasma species inside the computation
box. We see that the proton layer moves along the x-axis
and that the distance between the two layers increases.
The heavy ion layer expands due to Coulomb explosion
and tends to become rounded. Part of the electrons is
blown oﬀ by the laser pulse, while the rest forms a hot
cloud around the target. We notice that for the simula-
tion parameters the electrons do not expelled from the
region irradiated by the laser light completely. Even if
only a portion of the electrons is accelerated and heated
by the laser pulse, the induced quasi-static electric ﬁeld
appears to be strong enough to accelerate the protons up
65 M eV , as seen in Fig. 3 presenting the energy spectra
of the protons and heavy ions. The energy per nucleon
acquired by the heavy ions is approximately 380 times
smaller than the proton energy. The heavy ions have a
wide energy spectrum while the protons form a quasi-
mono-energetic bunch with ∆
< 5%. We emphasize
that the thinner the proton layer (or low-Z coating) the
better the beam quality is. The proton beam remains lo-
calized in space for a long time due to the bunching eﬀect
of the linearly decreasing electric ﬁeld in the acceleration
direction.

In conclusion, the use of the multi-layer targets with
diﬀerent shapes and compositions opens up new oppor-
tunities for controlling and optimizing the parameters of
the fast proton (ion) beam, such as the energy spectrum,
the number of particles per bunch, the beam focusing
and the size of the region where the beam deposits its

energy.

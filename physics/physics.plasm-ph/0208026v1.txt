Detailed computations of tokamak edge turbulence in three dimensional,
globally consistent ﬂux tube geometry show an inhibition of the standard

scenario in which zonal ExB ﬂows generated by the turbulence should lead to
transport barrier formation. It is found by comparison to slab geometry and
by analysis of the energetics that the zonal ﬂow energy is depleted by toroidal

coupling to the pressure through the geodesic curvature. Edge transport
barriers would then depend on the physics of the neoclassical equilibrium.

Drift Wave Turbulence and Zonal Flows. Drift wave turbulence is nonlinear, nonperiodic
motion involving disturbances on a background thermal gradient of a magnetised plasma

and eddies of ﬂuid like motion in which the advecting velocity of all charged species is the

ExB velocity [1,2]. The disturbances in the electric ﬁeld implied by the presence of these
eddies are caused by the tendency of the electron dynamics to establish a force balance

along the magnetic ﬁeld. Pressure disturbances have their parallel gradients balanced by a

parallel electric ﬁeld, whose static part is given by the parallel gradient of the electrostatic

potential. This potential in turn is the stream function for the ExB velocity in drift
planes, which are locally perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The turbulence is driven by

the background gradient, and the electron pressure and electrostatic potential are coupled

together through parallel currents. Departures from the static force balance are mediated

primarily through electromagnetic induction and resistive friction, but also the electron
inertia, which is not negligible [3]. Further details are provided by the temperatures, whose

dynamics is very robust due to nonlinear, time dependent Landau damping. In a three

dimensional, toroidal ﬂux surface geometry, the turbulence is characterised by a nonlinear
instability whose inherent vorticity is strong enough to “supersede” linear interchange

instabilities, giving tokamak edge turbulence a drift wave basic character [4].

Although this turbulence eﬀects an unsteady transport through nonlinear advection of

the thermodynamic state variables, actual modiﬁcation of the proﬁles proceeds on the much

slower transport time scale, typically at least three orders of magnitude slower than the
turbulence even in steep gradient regions. Such quasilinear modiﬁcation of the background

(a three wave interaction involving a wave and its complex conjugate driving changes in

the background) also occurs in the other variables, speciﬁcally the ExB vorticity, for which
the time scale is short enough for a self-consistent interaction with the turbulence to aﬀect

the dynamics of the turbulence itself. These are the “zonal ﬂows” [5], which are simply the

ExB ﬂows resulting from disturbances in the electrostatic potential which are constant on

a given magnetic ﬂux surface. One can think of a zonal ﬂow as a rigid poloidal rotation
of the entire ﬂux surface. These ﬂows are important because when and where they are

sheared they can cause a local suppression of the turbulence. Suppression of turbulence by

sheared ﬂows began by considering an imposed ﬂow which is part of the background [6]. It
was then pointed out that the process by which this suppression occurs conserves energy,

mainly involving a transfer of energy in three wave interactions from smaller scale eddies

and the larger scale background [7], a variant of the more general inverse energy cascade

from smaller to larger scales in two dimensional, incompressible turbulence [8]. Suppression
by imposed ExB shear was then shown in computations to proceed energetically [9]. Self

consistent interactions concern time dependent zonal ﬂows which have time and space

2

scales comparable to or only somewhat larger than those of the turbulence. Their study as
such [10], followed global scale computational studies showing them to be very important

in limiting the radial scale of the turbulence and consequently the resulting transport [11].

Their importance in fusion research lies in the fact that zonal ExB ﬂow (electric ﬁeld)
shear is thought to underly the transition and maintenance of the H-mode operation of

tokamak conﬁnement [12].

We here examine the physics of the zonal ﬂow/turbulence interaction in a model of the

turbulence which includes two important generalisations: departures from the “adiabatic”

state of perfect electron force balance, and an electromagnetic character in that response,
which allows signiﬁcant delays in the adiabatic response at larger perpendicular scales,

since the collisional response is through the parallel current, while the inductive response

is through the time dependence of the parallel magnetic potential (by Ampere’s law, the
current is given by the perpendicular Laplacian of that potential). We will ﬁnd that in

toroidal geometry, although the drive of the zonal ﬂows via Reynolds stress remains, the

geodesic curvature of the magnetic ﬁeld lines couples the zonal ﬂows to pressure sidebands

with ﬁnite parallel gradient. These sidebands serve as a localised part of the general source
for the turbulence, as the free energy transfer in the pressure disturbances is preferentially

towards smaller scales. The build up of strong, long lived ExB “mean ﬂow” shear layers

is thereby inhibited, preventing the turbulence from self consistently generating enough
ExB shear to strongly reduce its own amplitude. This prevents the scenario in which the

zonal ﬂow drive process should lead to transport barrier formation. In slab geometry, the

geodesic curvature eﬀect is absent and mean ﬂows do develop, but we ﬁnd by inserting

speciﬁcally this geodesic curvature eﬀect that the toroidal result is recovered (incidentally
demonstrating the weakness of the ballooning/interchange eﬀect in the turbulence). It is

important to note in this context that models of transport barrier formation by Reynolds

stress-induced self-generated ﬂows rely on two-dimensional slab geometry [13], and they
work well in such computations [14], but the three-dimensional toroidal result is rather

diﬀerent as documented herein.

The DALF3 Model. The simplest three dimensional model of drift wave dynamics which
takes the self consistent adiabatic response into account and allows it an electromagnetic
character is a four ﬁeld model in toroidal ﬂux tube geometry called DALF3 (the drift Alfv´en

potential

model [3] but omitting the temperature dynamics). The state variables are the electrostatic

current, controlled by those three eﬀects, to the pressure/potential static force imbalance,

e = Te/me) and the 0.51 comes from the parallel resistivity, ηk = 0.51meνe/nee2
velocity (V 2
[17]. The sound waves are controlled by ˆǫ = (cs/L⊥)2(qR/cs)2, just the parallel/perp scale
ratio. The eﬀects of magnetic curvature (the radius of curvature is R, the toroidal major
radius), entering through K ≡ ∇ · (c/B2)B×∇ are controlled by ωB = 2L⊥/R, which
can be set independently — slab geometry is ωB = 0. The coordinates are {x, y, s},
representing the down-gradient, electron drift, and parallel directions, respectively. The

computations are set up exactly as detailed in [15], with a grid of 64 × 256 × 16 nodes

in {x, y, s}, and with node spacings hx = hy = 20πρs/64 and hs = 2πqR/16. Nominal

We refer to the cases with ωB = 0 and 0.05 as the basic slab and toroidal cases,
respectively. The time traces for these cases appear in Fig. 1. The squared amplitudes
are shown for
φ (Aw). When strong zonal ﬂow
layers appear, they dominate the Ap signal because of the lack of k⊥ factors. The Aw
signal by contrast, with four additional k⊥ factors, mostly tracks the turbulence. For the
basic slab case, the turbulence saturates in the time range 200 < t < 400, after which it
is ground down by the rise of the overall ﬂow levels; Ap grows to large values, and Aw
correspondingly decreases. For the basic toroidal case, the saturation occurs at roughly

e

e

e

the same time scale, but the Ap curve saturates unsteadily at a much lower level, smaller
by about two orders of magnitude as in the slab case, reﬂecting the ﬂows which are simply

part of the turbulence. The turbulence saturates and maintains its level, close to the basic

gyro Bohm transport. All time traces reﬂect this saturated state. We therefore ﬁnd that
the spin up and suppress scenario operates moderately well in slab geometry but not at

all in toroidal geometry (for the same basic result in models including both temperatures

see [19]).

The eﬀort to explain this perhaps startling result forces systematic address of the

various toroidal eﬀects, all of which (in this model) operate through the curvature terms.
There are two basic eﬀects in the curvature operator K: the interchange dynamics itself,
and the geodesic curvature. Pure interchange dynamics operates on the ky 6= 0 part,
through Ky∂/∂y. The geodesic curvature eﬀect is in Kx∂/∂x. To test directly for the
geodesic curvature one must separate Kx out for the ky = 0 part and leave the Ky pure
interchange eﬀect alone. The reason for suspecting the geodesic curvature is that the zonal
ﬂow eﬀects lie in the ky = 0 part, for which the pure interchange eﬀect vanishes due to the
vanishing ∂/∂y.

The Geodesic Curvature Eﬀect. The basic mode of oscillation involving the geodesic
curvature is the classic MHD geodesic acoustic oscillation [20], which represents simple
coupling between the pressure and vorticity through the geodesic curvature Kx. The
pressure part of this is a sideband with parallel wavenumber kkqR = 1 which presents
itself as an interim free energy source to the turbulence. The potential part is the zonal
ﬂow; both are axisymmetric (ky = 0). Due to the strong direct cascade tendency, the
nonlinear ExB pressure advection, vE · ∇
pe, quickly delivers this free energy back to the
turbulence. Overall, this transfer process acts as a depletion channel for zonal ﬂow energy,

e

keeping the zonal ﬂow amplitude at levels comparable to the turblence. The loss channel
pe (the Kx terms in Eqs. 1,3), and then through
is from the zonal ﬂow
vE · ∇
pe back to the eddies of the turbulence. The mutual energy transfer is conservative,
so the tendency of the system to reach equipartition results in a ﬁnite population of the

φ to the sideband

e

e

zonal ﬂow mode, but not so large as to overwhelm the turbulence. We note that the fact
that the geodesic curvature couples all kk modes of a given ky requires us to keep or remove
it for all ky = 0 modes as a unit; otherwise, the resulting model would not conserve energy.
A modiﬁed toroidal case is constructed by taking Kx out of the ky = 0 part of the
basic toroidal case, and a modiﬁed slab case is made by putting Kx into the ky = 0 part
of the basic slab case, thereby isolating the geodesic curvature eﬀects on the ky = 0 part.
The results concerning the turbulence amplitudes and transport are shown in Fig. 2. Two

time traces are shown for each case: the transport (Qe) and the

φ squared amplitude (Ap).

Figure 2. Time traces of the squared amplitudes of
φ (Ap) and the transport
(Qe), for the four cases. The basic toroidal and modiﬁed slab cases reach
persistent saturation; both contain the geodesic curvature eﬀect. The basic
slab and modiﬁed toroidal cases lack this eﬀect and are both ground down by
strong, self generated ﬂow shear. This test conﬁrms the geodesic curvature
eﬀect of coupling zonal ﬂows to ﬁnite kk sidebands as the reason the spin up
and suppress scenario does not work in toroidal geometry.

e

We ﬁnd immediately that the two cases without geodesic curvature in the ky = 0 part are
similar, with the ﬂow amplitude rising to high values, grinding down the transport. The

two cases with the geodesic curvature in the ky = 0 part are also similar, with the potential
amplitude kept at levels low enough that the turbulence is not suppressed.

The morphology of

pe is shown for the four cases in Fig. 3. The basic slab
case shows dominance of the shear layer in the potential, with the vorticity disturbances

φ and

e

e

stretched into thin sheets sharply tilted into the y-direction. The basic toroidal case

also shows shear layers, but their vorticity represents a frequency not larger than that of

Figure 3. Morphology of the ﬂows and disturbances (1/2 of the y-domain is

of vorticity (∇2
φ) stretched in the y-direction. The basic toroidal case shows

φ, but they are of similar magnitude as the turbulence
visible shear layers in
and do not strongly aﬀect the form of ∇2
φ. These are the time dependent
⊥
zonal ﬂow layers visible in the unsteady
φ amplitude in Fig. 2. The modiﬁed
toroidal case appears slablike, while the modiﬁed slab case looks like the basic
toroidal case.

the basic turbulence, which is why a strong amount of suppression does not occur. The
modiﬁed toroidal case shows the strong shear layer of the basic slab case, and the modiﬁed
slab case shows the structure of the basic toroidal case. The shear levels of these weaker
ﬂows are comparable to the dynamical frequencies of the turbulence (about 0.1cs/L⊥).
The Ap curves for these two cases with weaker ﬂows show those ﬂows to be short-lived,
comparable to the correlation time of the turbulence (about 6L⊥/cs). These are the zonal
ﬂows which remain as part of the turbulence, leading in fact to moderate suppression but
allowing it to remain at a robust amplitude.

Figure 4. Snapshots of the zonal ﬂow proﬁles for the four cases. The basic
toroidal and modiﬁed slab cases show the weak, time dependent zonal ﬂows
which are part of the turbulence. The basic slab and modiﬁed toroidal cases
show the strong, self generated shear layers which suppress the turbulence.

The instantaneous proﬁles (the zonal ﬂow mode, ky = kk = 0) of

φ are shown for the

9

e

four cases in Fig. 4, in the same arrangement as for the time traces. The ﬂow shear of
these is strong or weak according to whether the geodesic curvature is absent or present
in the ky = 0 part, respectively. A rough guide of whether these sheared ﬂow layers are
able to suppress the turbulence is given by what can be called the “diamagnetic ﬂow shear
level” given by

ΩD = vD/L⊥

(9)

where vD = cTe/eBL⊥ is the diamagnetic velocity. The level of shear in the
φ proﬁles
(actually given by the vorticity proﬁle) is well below this for the two unsuppressed cases
(basic toroidal and modiﬁed slab), and well above this for the other two cases. (ALT: show
vor proﬁles, note diag shear is ρ∗ in n.u., while turb omega is about 0.1)

e

Figure 5. Transport trend versus collisionality. The drift wave regime extends
to ν = 10, at which CωB ≈ 1, and for these parameters the standard ν∗ is
136. The basic toroidal and slab cases are compared to companion runs in
which the zonal ﬂow drive is removed. The time dependent zonal ﬂows are the
diﬀerence in the toroidal case; the self generated shear layers, in the slab case.
The comparison between the basic toroidal and modiﬁed slab cases shows the
role of pure interchange forcing; the diﬀerence at ν = 3 (C = 7.65) is about 20
percent.

The transport results for various collisionality are summarised in Fig. 5 (note C =
2.55ν). The basic toroidal and slab cases show similar trends if zonal ﬂows are eliminated
entirely by removing the ﬂux surface average of vE · ∇∇2
φ. The ﬂuctuating zonal ﬂows
⊥
provide a slightly reduced transport in the basic toroidal case, but the strong shear layers
in the basic slab case strongly suppress the turbulence, even more so for larger C. The
modiﬁed slab case is much like the basic toroidal case, showing the eﬀects of geodesic

e

10

curvature to inhibit the strong shear layers, leaving the ﬂuctuating zonal ﬂows and the
pure interchange eﬀects intact. The small diﬀerence between those two cases is the pure
interchange eﬀect, incidentally showing that direct interchange drive in toroidal geometry
is but a small perturbation on an existing drift wave mode structure.

The coupling of zonal ﬂows to geodesic acoustic oscillations can be further demon-
strated through the energy theorem satisﬁed by the zonal ﬂows and the pressure sidebands.
Let h· · ·i denote the ﬂux surface average and note that it commutes with ∂/∂x but an-
nihilates ∂/∂y. Let {· · ·} further denote the average over x. The zonal ﬂow potential is
hφi, the zonal ﬂow is hvyi = h∂φ/∂xi, the zonal vorticity is hΩi = h∂vy/∂xi, and the zonal
ﬂow energy is
. Through the geodesic curvature the zonal ﬂow is coupled to the
Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter Alfv´en mode and then again to modiﬁcations in the background pressure
(assuming unit diagonal metric, and neglecting sound waves, magnetic nonlinearities, and
sidebands with

> 1):

If time averages are taken, the left sides of these equations vanish and the right sides become
balances between drive, transfer, and depletion mechanisms. The drive for the zonal ﬂow
is the zonally averaged Reynolds stress hvxvyi, correlated with the zonal vorticity. The
depletion mechanism is geodesic transfer to the Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter sideband hpe sin si, and
the depletion for that is the nonlinear transfer of free energy back to the turbulence (which
requires nonadiabatic electrons, enabled by the ﬁnite ˆβ). The ﬂow sideband hvy sin si is

(cid:11)
acoustic oscillation is that between hφi and hpe sin si as correctly noted in [20], the only
subsystem not strongly aﬀected by the Alfv´en dynamics. We recognise {h∂pe/∂xi hQxi}
as the negative of the main drive of the self sustained turbulence (cf. [21]), and hence
as the corresponding depletion of the background hpei. The proﬁle is maintained by the
pe to zero at the boundaries in x, which aﬀects both
damping of the ky = 0 part of
hpei and hpe sin si. For the nominal case the zonal Reynolds stress and geodesic transfer
were measured at 0.858 ± 0.359 and 1.02 ± 0.305, and depletion of the sideband went
through the nonlinearity, the proﬁle maintenance, and the Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter transfer to

the background at 0.470 ± 0.431 and 0.301 ± 0.100 and 0.103 ± 0.0741, respectively, with
all other sideband eﬀects much smaller (all numbers ×10−2). The nonlinear depletion
of hpe sin si functions because of the pointwise correlation of Qx with −∂pe/∂x. Indeed,
while either of these two sin s terms is small in time average, the average of their product is

not, because of this correlation. This energetic depletion therefore overwhelms any slight

was found to be close to Gaussian. The pressure nonlinearity is therefore a depletion
pe →
of the sideband and therefore ultimately of the zonal ﬂow. The energy ﬂow is
hφi → hpe sin si →
pe, through the Reynolds stress, geodesic curvature, and nonlinear ﬂux
correlation, respectively. The Stringer-Taylor eﬀect is therefore a sink for the zonal ﬂow
system, not a source as incorrectly reported in Ref. [22], whose runs were apparently not

e

e

taken to complete statistical saturation and in any case suﬀer from all the shortcomings

of the drift resistive ballooning paradigm (cf. Ref. [18]).

Main Points. The principal result of this study is that while the turbulent Reynolds
stress always tends towards a transfer of energy from small eddies to the larger scale
zonal ﬂows (similar kx but disparate ky), in toroidal geometry the geodesic curvature
couples the zonal ﬂows to ﬁnite-kk pressure sidebands, which act as a loss channel by
means of nonlinear advective transfer back to the turbulence. This prevents large scale,
large amplitude zonal ﬂows from forming and therefore rules out the spin up and suppress

scenario for transport barrier formation, at least due to local (homogeneous) action of the

ExB Reynolds stress. The ExB shear layers observed in tokamak edge transport barriers
[12] must therefore come from some other mechanism, most likely having to do with the

neoclassical equilibrium. Two recent proposals are a generalised ion orbit loss mechanism

[23,24], and the generation of a large parallel ﬂow and its equilibrium electric ﬁeld proﬁle

by coupling to the open ﬁeld line regions [25]. For the core regions the electron response
is more adiabatic and electrostatic, so that current results on core zonal ﬂows [11] are not

aﬀected.

Abstract

An eﬃcient method to describe the nonlinear evolution of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in long

scale-length plasmas is presented. The method is based on a decomposition of the hydrodynamics

variables in long- and short-wavelength components.

It makes it possible to describe the self-

consistent coupling between the plasma hydrodynamics, Stimulated Brillouin Scattering, and the

generation of harmonics of the excited ion acoustic wave (IAW). This description is benchmarked

numerically and proves to be reliable even in the case of an undamped ion acoustic wave. The

momentum transferred from the electromagnetic waves to the plasma ions is found to induce a

plasma ﬂow which modiﬁes the resonant three wave coupling between the IAW and the light waves.

A novel picture of SBS arises, in which both IAW harmonics and ﬂow modiﬁcation reduce the

coherence of SBS by inducing local defects in the density and velocity proﬁles. The spatial domains

of Stimulated Brillouin activity are separated by these defects and are consequently uncorrelated,

resulting in a broad and structured spectrum of the scattered light and in a temporally chaotic

reﬂectivity.

The description of parametric instabilities in laser-produced plasmas using simple coupled

mode equations for three wave interaction is no longer suﬃcient whenever the longitudinal

plasma waves are driven to large amplitudes. Then the nonlinearities of the longitudinal

wave can induce detuning with respect to the three wave resonance. This is one of the

reasons usually invoked to explain why these simpliﬁed models overestimate the scattering

levels of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS). In this article we concentrate on SBS, which

is the process by which the incident laser wave couples to an ion acoustic wave (IAW) to

give rise to a scattered transverse wave. The generation of the harmonics due to the IAW

ﬂuid-type nonlinearity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is already known to be able to reduce signiﬁcantly

the SBS reﬂectivity when compared with the results involving simply a linearized IAW.

However, the previous ﬂuid-type models for SBS in Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4], aimed at taking into

account the IAW nonlinearity, were incomplete because they did not properly describe the

ﬂow modiﬁcation [6, 7] caused by the incident transverse wave momentum deposition. All

the mentioned models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] also ignored multi-dimensional eﬀects. On the other

hand, kinetic eﬀects associated with particle trapping [8] give also rise to a nonlinear IAW

frequency shift and therefore modify the SBS nonlinear behavior.

In the present Letter, we reconsider the eﬀect of the IAW nonlinearities on SBS by ac-

counting properly for the ﬂow modiﬁcation caused by SBS. We ﬁrst derive approximate

equations describing simultaneously the plasma hydrodynamics (i.e. the long wavelength

density and ﬂow proﬁles), SBS, and the harmonic generation of the excited IAW resulting

from ﬂuid-type nonlinearity. Our method consists in decomposing the ﬂuid variables into

long and short wavelength components, the latter corresponding to the SBS generated IAW

and its harmonics[9]. Our new code, based on this harmonic decomposition method, makes

it possible to describe plasmas of spatial sizes of the order of realistic laser produced plasmas

(of mm-size, typically), because it does not resolve the IAW µm-scale. We then continued

a step further by checking the capacity of our approach to account for kinetic eﬀects ef-

fects by implementing in the IAW propagator a nonlinear frequency shift modeling particle

trapping.[8]

The transverse electric ﬁeld is described by E(x, t) = e−iω0t

(cid:17) + c.c.
where E+(x, t) and E−(x, t) are the forward- and backward propagating light ﬁeld compo-

(cid:16)E+eik0z + E−e−ik0z

nents, respectively, both enveloped in time and space with respect to the light frequency ω0

and the wave number k0. This wave number is taken for a ﬁxed reference plasma density

2

Neq which yields, using the critical electron density nc, k2

0(1 − Neq/nc)/c2. For the
plasma density n(x, t) and the velocity v(x, t) we use a decomposition separating the long-

0 = ω2

wavelength components N0(x, t) and v0(x, t) and the short-wavelength components np(x, t)

and vp(x, t), with |p| = 1, 2, ...,

n = N0 + (cid:16)n1eiksz + n2eiksz + .. + c.c.(cid:17) ,
v = v0 + (cid:16)v1eiksz + v2eiksz + .. + c.c.(cid:17) ,

the ﬁrst (p=0) representing the hydrodynamic evolution, and the terms with p >0, the

fundamental ion acoustic wave, p =1, excited by SBS, and its harmonics, p >1. The

reference wave number for the IAW is the wavenumber of backscattering, ks = 2k0, for
which the ponderomotive force is proportional to ∝ E+E∗

− exp(i2k0z).

We use the paraxial approximation to reduce the wave equation for the total electromag-

netic ﬁeld E to two “paraxial” equations for E+(x, t) and E−(x, t),

Lpar(E+) = −i(ω0/cNeq) [n1E− +(N0 − Neq)E+] ,

Lpar(E−) = −i(ω0/cNeq) [n∗

1E+ +(N0 − Neq)E−] ,

(1)

(2)

with the paraxial operator Lpar(E±) = [∂t + c±∂z + νt −i(c2/2ω0)∇2

⊥]E±, where c+ and c−

stand for the group velocity of the forward/backward propagating light, respectively, with
c+ = c2k0/ω0 = −c−, and νt denotes the damping of the transversal waves. The right-hand-

side (rhs) source terms in equations (1) and (2) account for (i) resonant 3-wave coupling due

to SBS, with the fundamental ion sound wave, n1, and for (ii) refraction on long-wavelength

density modiﬁcations, N0 − Neq, causing e.g. self-focusing. In comparison with the full wave

equation without decomposition into E±, this model allows a considerably coarser spatial

resolution and thus much less numerical expense.

For the long-wavelength hydrodynamic component we use the following set of equations,

assuming isothermal conditions, and written in the conservative form on the left-hand side

(lhs):

∂tN0 + ∇N0v0 = (∂tn)IAW ,
∂t (N0v0) + ∇ (N0v0v0) + c2

s∇N0 =

−N0c2

s∇U0 + (∂tnv)IAW ,

(3)

(4)

where the rhs source terms, (∂tn)IAW and (∂tnv)IAW, describe the momentum transfer into
the ﬂow due to the IAW excitation by SBS, with (∂tnv)IAW ≡ 2cs (2νs1 − v0 · ∇) |n1|2/N0,

3

and (∂tn)IAW ≡ −2cs∇ (|n1|2/N0) . The ponderomotive force is given by ∇U0 = ǫ0∇(|E+|2 +
|E−|2)/ncTe. The equations describing the IAW driven by SBS, n1, and its harmonics, nl>1
(using the convention n−l = n∗

l for the complex conjugate) can be written, in the so-called

weak coupling regime, as follows

h∂t + νsl + iωl + (v0z + vgl)∂z − i(cs/2lks)∇2
−/ncT (cid:17) + 2Ql/N 2

P

speed (with Z and Mi as the ion charge and mass), v0z the z-component of the ﬂow v0; vgl

and ωl denote the group velocity and the “local” frequency of the l-th IAW harmonic, both

accounting for the dispersion due to Debye shielding increasing with the harmonic order.
They are given by vgl = cs(1 + l2k2
D)−3/2 and by ωl(z) = ωs(lkscs) + lksv0z(z) with the
s λ2
D)−1/2. Equations (1)-(5) describe what we call the
IAW frequency ωs(k) = kcs(1 + k2λ2
harmonic decomposition model. They form a closed system describing SBS in a temporally

and spatially evolving plasma. They can be shown to conserve momentum [7] at the lowest
order in 1/(ksℓk) and in 1/(ksℓ⊥)2 (with the inhomogeneity length ℓk = |∂zv0/v0|−1 and
ℓ⊥ = |∇⊥v0/v0|−1).

In the following we emphasize the particular importance (i) of the SBS-induced ﬂow

modiﬁcation, originating from the rhs term of Eq. (3) as well as of the term (∂tnv)IAW

on the rhs of Eq. (4), and (ii) of the IAW harmonic generation described by the coupling

terms ∝

nhnm−h in the rhs of Eq. (5). In order to stress the eﬀect of each mechanism,

P

we neglect for simplicity the IAW damping, (while being aware that the IAW damping

coeﬃcient is usually of the order of a few percent of the IAW frequency).

Indeed, the

SBS-induced ﬂow modiﬁcation due to momentum transfer, ﬁrst pointed out by Rose in

Ref.[6], cannot be ignored in the regime of absolute instability corresponding to weak IAW

damping, because it is just in this regime that the stationary 1D limit of Eqs. (3) and (4)

exhibits the most pronounced ﬂow modiﬁcation. Namely, the generation of the backscattered

light gives rise to a transfer of momentum to the bulk plasma in the spatial domain of

SBS activity. This momentum transfer results in a decrease ∆v ≡ v0,out − v0,in < 0 of

the ﬂow v0 in the direction of propagation of the laser, the net ﬂow decrease being given
by ∆v ≃ −2RSBS(2ǫ0|E+|2/NeqTe)(1 − Neq/2nc). Here, RSBS denotes the SBS reﬂectivity

corresponding to the considered SBS active region.

FIG. 1: SBS reﬂectivity RSBS versus time for the case of an undamped IAW with the parameters

IL = 2.5 · 1014W/cm2 for λ0 = 1.064µm at Te = 1keV, N0/nc =0.1 (taken at center), 2k0λD =0.27,

Lini ≃ 160λ0. The solid line is obtained from the decomposition code considering all terms, the

dashed line from the decomposition code disregarding higher IAW harmonics, and the dash-dotted

line from the ”full” code.

We have performed simulations on the basis of equations (1)-(5) and expanded the IAW

up to its 3rd harmonic, resulting in a set of equations for n1, n2, and n3, with the rhs terms

Q1 = n2n∗

1 + n3n2∗, Q2 = n2

1 + 2n3n∗

1, and Q3 = 3n2n1. We did not observe any signiﬁcant

changes when harmonics above the 3rd order were retained, while restricting to less than 3

harmonics led to important diﬀerences. At this stage of our study we restricted ourselves to

one-dimensional (1D) simulations in order to benchmark our harmonic decomposition code

against a “complete” 1D code which does not make the decomposition corresponding to

Eqs. (1)-(3). This latter code solves Helmholtz’s equation for the total electric ﬁeld E(z, t)

on the ﬁrst hand, and the system of ﬂuid equations for continuity and momentum, with the

complete ponderomotive force, ∇|E(z, t)|2, as a source term, on the second hand. Here, in

1D, the operator ∇ reduces to the partial derivative ez∂z.

To ensure equivalent boundary and initial conditions we have considered a realistic case

similar to an “exploding foil”, where an initially heated plasma expands starting from an

almost box-like density proﬁle, with smooth shoulders, in the interval z1 < z < z2 along

the laser axis. The plasma proﬁle, with the initial plateau width Lini ≃ 160λ0, successively

undergoes rarefaction from each side, so that the velocity proﬁle eventually tends to a

5

monotonous curve varying from negative to positive values with v0 = 0 in the center. The

simulation box is chosen in such a way that the rarefaction of the proﬁle does not signiﬁcantly

change the boundary conditions for the light ﬁelds at the entrance (zent = 0 < z1) and the

rear side (zrear > z2). The total box size is zrear = 2000/k0 ≃ 320λ0, where λ0 = 2π/k0

denotes the laser wavelength. The boundary condition for the incident light at z = 0 is a

constant, E+(0) = const, whereas the backscattered light is seeded with a noise source at
the level h|E−(z = zrear)|2i ∼ 10−6|E+(z = 0)|2 and with a spectral bandwidth suﬃciently

larger than the IAW frequency, in order to cover all possible SBS resonances in the proﬁle.

In the density proﬁle wings left and right of the central plateau (for times t < Lini/2cs), the

plasma is strongly inhomogeneous in velocity and density so that SBS is inhibited by the

strong ﬂow gradient.

We carried out our simulations in the absolute instability regime of SBS with undamped

IAWs, both to examine the role of ﬂow due to momentum transfer, and to benchmark the

robustness of our decomposition code. Notice that in the case of completely undamped

IAWs the SBS saturation level is, according to Refs.

[10, 11], independent of the noise

level. For the chosen electron density Neq/nc = 0.1 and for the plasma length indicated

above, the standard three-wave interaction model for undamped IAWs [10, 11] predicts a

steep increase in the SBS reﬂectivities RSBS as a function of the laser intensity, varying from

RSBS << 1 for small laser intensities to RSBS ≃ 1 for normalized laser intensities above
0 = ǫ0|E0|2/ncTe ≃ 0.003, with E0 denoting E0 = E+(z = 0). Our simulations comparing
a2
the decomposition code and the “complete” code show very good agreement, even for the

extreme case shown in Fig. 1, corresponding to the plasma parameters mentioned above and

to a2
0 = 0.025 and 2k0λD = 0.27 (corresponding to an electron temperature Te = 1keV and
a laser intensity IL = 2.5 · 1014W/cm2 at λ0 = 1.064µm), for which the reﬂectivity would be

99% in the absence of any IAW nonlinearity or ﬂow modiﬁcations. For lower intensity values,

the agreement is even more striking. This excellent agreement between the two codes gives

us conﬁdence in the robustness of the harmonic decomposition description. In the simulation

presented in Figs. 1 and 2, the maximum amplitudes of the harmonics remained below the
validity condition for harmonic expansion, namely |nl/Neq| < 61/2(lksλD)2 for l = 1, 2, 3.

It can be observed, in the spatial proﬁles shown in Fig. 2 for the backscattered inten-
sity |E−|2, the fundamental IAW amplitude |n1|, the ﬂow v0, and the plasma proﬁle N0,

that the IAW behavior and ﬂow modiﬁcations are entirely connected with the existence of

shoulders of the exploding foil proﬁle.

“defects” in these spatial proﬁles and with a non-monotonous character in space (see also

Ref.[4]). Namely, SBS develops in distinct spatial domains, interrupted by phase defects,

which originate in the density proﬁle shoulders corresponding to the low density plasma on

the laser entrance side, and which then propagate into the proﬁle plateau. Thus the SBS

activity in each spatial domain appears to be uncorrelated, due to their diﬀerent origin in

the inhomogeneous velocity proﬁle v0. This feature reﬂects in the structured nature of the

backscattered light temporal spectrum, shown in Fig. 3 in which distinct peaks appear, and,

consequently, in the temporally chaotic behavior of the reﬂectivity.

7

Our decomposition description makes it possible to discriminate the relative importance of

the various eﬀects contributing to the nonstationary behavior in the SBS reﬂectivity, as seen

in Fig. 1. By suppressing parts of these eﬀects in diﬀerent runs, we have found that the most

important eﬀect is the excitation of the IAW harmonics: namely, retaining the harmonic

excitation and neglecting the SBS-induced ﬂow modiﬁcation lead to results that remain in

reasonably good agreement with the exact model, whereas, retaining the ﬂow modiﬁcation,

but ignoring the harmonics leads to unphysically high levels of IAW amplitudes. It follows

from these observations that a realistic modeling of SBS requires the proper description

of the IAW harmonics. The 1D simulations presented here would correspond to the SBS

development in a long laser hot spot. We have recently carried out 2D simulations which

conﬁrm the relevance in 2D of the scenario described above whenever the hot spot focus

is not far (less than approximately one Rayleigh length) from the transition between the

inhomogeneous and the homogeneous domain of the plasma density proﬁle (i. e. the shoulder

of the expanding plasma in our case).

Increasing the laser intensity induces stronger IAW amplitudes at which ion and/or elec-

tron kinetic eﬀects take place. We have included phenomenologically weak ion kinetic

eﬀects in our decomposition model by adding a non-linear frequency shift of the form
−iη|n1/Neq|1/2, [8] in the propagator appearing in the lhs of Eq. (5) describing the evo-

lution of the IAW fundamental component and of its harmonics. Although this is subject of

work in progress, let us mention that we have solved numerically the corresponding equation

Eqs. (1)-(5), and we ﬁnd that for a positive and suﬃciently large η coeﬃcient (≃ 0.5 . . . 0.7),

this shift can smooth out the eﬀect induced by the harmonics and the ﬂow, in a way such that

(i) the “defects” are less pronounced and (ii) the SBS reﬂectivity diminishes, but without

exhibiting a strong nonstationary behavior. In conclusion, we have shown that the SBS mod-

eling presented here, based on a harmonic decomposition of the hydrodynamics variables,

represent a promising way to describe laser plasma interaction in long scale-length plasmas.

We have benchmarked our code based on the harmonic decomposition in the extreme limit

of the absolute instability regime by neglecting the IAW damping. A novel picture of SBS

arises in which an incoherent superposition of scattered light generated in distinct spatial

domains in the velocity proﬁle leads to a nonstationary character of the SBS reﬂectivity and

to a signiﬁcant reduction in the time averaged reﬂectivity. This harmonic decomposition

description appears to be suﬃciently robust and versatile to allow further sophistication by

Quantum electrodynamical modes in pair plasmas

Abstract. We predict the existence of new nonlinear electromagnetic wave
modes in pair plasmas. The plasma may be either non-magnetized or immersed
in an external magnetic ﬁeld. The existence of these modes depends on the
interaction of an intense circularly polarized electromagnetic wave with a plasma,
where the nonlinear quantum vacuum eﬀects are taken into account. This gives
rise to new couplings between matter and radiation. We focus on pair plasmas,
since the new modes are expected to exist in highly energetic environments, such
as pulsar magnetospheres and the next generation of laser–plasma systems.

1. Introduction.

Quantum electrodynamics
(QED) oﬀers new phenomena with no classical
counterparts, such as the Casimir eﬀect. Similarly, and related to the Casimir eﬀect, is
so called photon–photon scattering (see, e.g., [1–4]). The eﬀective interaction between
photons in a quantum vacuum is mediated by virtual electron–positron pairs, and
therefore cannot occur within standard Maxwell electrodynamics. Photon–photon
collisions have attracted much interest over the years, both from an experimental
and an astrophysical point of view (see [5–20] and references therein). The eﬀect
of photon–photon scattering could be of fundamental importance in high-intensity
laser pulses, in ultra-strong cavity ﬁelds, in the surroundings of neutron stars and
magnetars, and in the early Universe. However, the presence of plasmas in many
highly energetic systems makes their theoretical analysis less tractable than the pure
quantum vacuum model. Anyhow, we here present a theory of electromagnetic wave
interaction in plasmas, taking photon–photon scattering into account. It is shown that
under certain circumstances the weak QED eﬀects will act to generate distinct new
wave modes. Speciﬁcally, we focus on pair plasmas, and argue that our new modes
could be of importance in the next generation of laser–plasmas, as well as in pulsar
magnetospheres.

2. Basic equations.

The weak nonlinear self-interaction of photons in the quantum vacuum can be
expressed in terms of the Heisenberg–Euler Lagrangian [1]

F ab/4 = cE · B, and
Fab = ǫabcdF cd/2 is the dual of Maxwell’s ﬁeld strength tensor Fab. Here κ ≡

The Lagrangian (1) is valid when

|E| ≪ ES ≡ mec2/eλc

respectively. Here e is the elementary charge, λc the Compton wavelength, ωe the
Compton frequency, and ES ≃ 1018 V/m the Schwinger ﬁeld strength. The ﬁrst
inequalility states that the individual photons should not create real electron–positron
pairs out of vacuum ﬂuctuations, while the second states that the collective energy of
many photons should not create real electron–positron pairs.

Using Eq. (1), the dispersion relation, in the absence of matter ﬁelds, for photons

in a background electromagnetic ﬁeld E, B is [5, 15]

If the amplitude of the vector potential varies slowly, we can derive a nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation by taking the media response into account. We may take the
scalar potential φ = 0. The weakly varying vector potential amplitude A = A(t, z)
then satisﬁes [24]

In the limit of no photon–photon scattering, i.e. α → 0, we recover the modes found
in Ref. [22].

Magnetized pair plasmas can be found in the surroundings of pulsars and strongly
magnetized stars, e.g. in the form of accretion disks. At a distance from the star’s
surface, the magnetic ﬁeld will be weak, being essentially dipole in character, and the
ﬁrst term in the square bracket of Eq. (19) will be the dominant QED contribution.
Close to neutron stars or magnetars, the magnetic ﬁeld strengths are in the range
106 − 1011 T [26,27], and, depending on the frequency of the circularly polarized wave,
the second term in the square bracket of Eq. (19) may dominate the behavior of the
wave mode. If cB0 & ES, we have

5. Discussion and conclusion

Most situations in which photon–photon scattering can be important are of an
extreme nature.
Examples of environments where the eﬀects may either be
dynamically signiﬁcant, or measurable, are the next generation of high power lasers
and possibly their combination with plasmas into laser–plasma systems [12, 20], high
ﬁeld superconducting cavities [14], and astrophysical environments, such as pulsar
magnetospheres [26] and the vicinity of magnetars [27]. In astrophysical environments,
eﬀects such as photon splitting or magnetic lensing have been suggested to take
place [5–7, 16]. Even in cosmology, the eﬀects of photon–photon scattering could be
detectable using precision observations of the cosmic microwave background [19, 28].
However, plasmas may in many circumstances be a prominent component of the
physical systems considered above. For example, it is currently believed that the
highest experimental ﬁeld strengths could be obtained using laser–plasma systems [29].
Therefore, the addition of plasmas to the dynamics of photon–photon scattering adds
an important piece to our understanding of the nonlinear quantum vacuum, and as
shown here, could provide a unique signature of photon–photon scattering. It remains
to be seen whether this can be realized in a laboratory or in astrophysics.

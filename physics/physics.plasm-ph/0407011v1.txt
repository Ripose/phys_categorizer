Abstract. The well-known gyrokinetic problem regards the perturbative expansion related to the dynamics of a charged
particle subject to fast gyration motion due to the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Although a variety of approaches have
been formulated in the past to this well known problem, surprisingly a purely canonical approach based on Lie transform
methods is still missing. This paper aims to ﬁll in this gap and provide at the same time new insight in Lie-transform
approaches.

INTRODUCTION: TRANSFORMATION APPROACH TO GYROKINETIC THEORY

A great interest for the description of plasmas is still vivid in the scientiﬁc community. Plasmas enter problems related
to several ﬁelds from astrophysics to fusion theory. A crucial and for some aspects still open theoretical problem is the
gyrokinetic theory, which concerns the description of the dynamics for a charged point particle immersed in a suitably
intense magnetic ﬁeld. In particular, the “gyrokinetic problem” deals with the construction of appropriate perturbation
theories for the particle equations of motion, subject to a variety of possible physical conditions. Historically, after
initial pioneering work [1, 2, 3], and a variety of different perturbative schemes, a general formulation of gyrokinetic
theory valid from a modern perspective is probably due to Littlejohn [4], based on Lie transform perturbation methods
[5, 6, 7, 8]. For the sake of clarity these gyrokinetic approaches can be conveniently classiﬁed as follows (see also
Fig.1):
A) direct non-canonical transformation methods: in which non-canonical gyrokinetic variables are constructed by
means of suitable one-step [1], or iterative, transformation schemes, such as a suitable averaging technique [9], a
one-step gyrokinetic transformation [10], a non-canonical iterative scheme [11]. These methods are typically difﬁcult
(or even impossible) to be implemented at higher orders;
B) canonical transformation method based on mixed-variable generating functions: this method, based on canonical
perturbation theory, was ﬁrst introduced by Gardner [2, 12] and later used by other authors [13]). This method
requires, preliminarily, to represent the Hamiltonian in terms of suitable ﬁeld-related canonical coordinates, i.e.,
coordinates depending on the the topology of the magnetic ﬂux lines. This feature, added to the unsystematic
character of canonical perturbation theory, makes its application to gyrokinetic theory difﬁcult, a feature that becomes
even more critical for higher-order perturbative calculations;
C) non-canonical Lie-transform methods: these are based on the adoption of the non-canonical Lie-transform pertur-
bative approach developed by Littlejohn [4]. The method is based on the use arbitrary non-canonical variables, which
can be ﬁeld-independent. This feature makes the application of the method very efﬁcient and, due to the peculiar
features for the perturbative scheme, it permits the systematic evaluation of higher-order perturbative terms. The
method has been applied since to gyrokinetic theory by several authors [14, 15, 16, 17];
D) canonical Lie-transform methods applied to non-canonical variables: see for example [18]. Up to now this

method has been adopted in gyrokinetic theory only using preliminar non-canonical variables, i.e., representing the
Hamiltonian function in terms of suitable, non-canonical variables (similar to those adopted by Littlejohn). This
method, although conceptually similar to the developed by Littlejohn, is more difﬁcult to implement.

All of these methods share some common features,in particular:

- they may require the application of multiple transformations, in order to construct the gyrokinetic variables;
- the application of perturbation methods requires typically the representation of the particle state in terms of suitable,
generally non-canonical, state variables. This task may be, by itself, difﬁcult since it may require the adoption of a
preliminary perturbative expansion.
An additional important issue is the construction of gyrokinetic canonical variables. The possibility of constructing
canonical gyrokinetic variables has relied, up to now, on essentially two methods, i.e., either by adopting a purely
canonical approach, like the one developed by Gardner [2, 12], or using the so-called “Darboux reduction algorithm”,
based on Darboux theorem [4]. The latter is obtained by a suitable combination of dynamical gauge and coordinate
transformations, permitting the representation of the fundamental gyrokinetic canonical 1-form in terms of the canon-
ical variables. The application of both methods is nontrivial, especially for higher order pertubative calculations. The
second method, in particular, results inconvenient since it may require an additional perturbative sub-expansion for the
explicit evaluation of gyrokinetic canonical variables.
For these reasons a direct approach to gyrokinetic theory, based on the use of purely canonical variables and transfor-
mations may result a viable alternative. Purpose of this work is to formulate a “purely” canonical Lie-transform theory
and to explicitly evaluate the canonical Lie-generating function providing the canonical gyrokinetic transformation.

LIE-TRASFORM PERTURBATION THEORY

We review some basic aspects of perturbation theory for classical dynamical systems. Let us consider the state x of a
dynamical system and its d-dimensional phase-space M endowed with a vector ﬁeld X. With respect to some variables
x =

we assume that X has representation [6]

xi

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

where e
is an ordering parameter. We treat all power series formally; convergence is of secondary concern to us. By
hypothesis, the leading term X0 of (1) represents a solvable system, so that the integral curves of X are approximated
by the known integral curves of X0. The strategy of perturbation theory is to seek a coordinate transformation to a new
set of variables
, such that with respect to them the new equations of motion are simpliﬁed. Since (1) is solvable
at the lowest order, the coordinate transformation is the identity at lowest order, namely

¯xi

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

The transformation is canonical if it preserves the fundamental Poisson brackets. It can be determined by means of
generating functions, Lie generating function or mixed-variables generating functions, depending on the case. In the
Lie transform method, one uses transformations T which are represented as exponentials of some vector ﬁeld, or rather
compositions of such transformations. To begin, let us consider a vector ﬁeld G, which is associated with the system
of ordinary differential equations

dxi
de = Gi(x),
so that if x and ¯x are initial and ﬁnal points along an integral curve (3), separated by an elapsed parameter e , then
¯x = T x. In the usual exponential representation for advance maps, we have

(3)

dxi
dt

= X i

¯xi = xi + O(e )

T = exp(e G).

We will call G the generator of the transformation T . In Hamiltonian perturbation theory the transformation T is
usually required to be a canonical transformation. Canonical transformations have the virtue that they preserve the
form of Hamilton’s equations of motion. Canonical transformation can be represented by mixed-variable generating
function, as in the Poincare-Von Zeipel method or by means of Lie transform. In the latter method vector ﬁelds G are
speciﬁed through the Hamilton’s equations. Following a more conventional approach, we can write the (3) in terms of
the transformed point

d ¯x
de = [¯x, w
The components of the above relation are just Hamilton’s equations in Poisson bracket notation applied to the
“Hamiltonian” (Lie generating function) w
the “time.” Equation (5) therefore generates a
canonical transformation for any e

to a ﬁnal state ¯x whose components satisfy the Poisson bracket condition

, with the parameter e

THE CANONICAL LIE TRANSFORM APPROACH TO GYROKINETIC THEORY

The customary approach based on Lie-transform methods and due to Littlejohn [4] adopts “hybrid” (i.e., non-canonical
and non-Lagrangian) variables to represent particle state, i.e., of the form z = (y,f ). There are several reasons, usually
invoked for this choice. In the ﬁrst place, the adoption of hybrid variables may be viewed, by some authors, as
convenient for mathematical simplicity. However, the subsequent calculation of canonical variables (realized by means
of Darboux theorem) may be awkward and give rise to ambiguities issues [13]. Other reasons may be related to the
the ordering scheme to adopted in a canonical formulation: in fact, in gyrokinetic theory, the vector potential A in
the canonical momentum must be regarded of order 1/O(e ) while keeping the linear momentum of zero order, i.e.,
p =mv+ q
e c A. As a consequence, in a perturbative theory p must be expanded retaining at the same time terms of order
1/O(e ) and O(e 0), a feature which may give rise to potential ambiguities. According to Littlejohn [4] this can be
avoided by the adoption of suitable hybrid variables, which should permit to decouple at any order the calculations
of the perturbations determined by means of suitable Lie-generators. However, a careful observation reveals that the
same ambiguity (ordering mixing) is present also in his method. In fact, one ﬁnds that the ﬁrst application of the
non-canonical Lie-operator method, yielding the lowest order approximation for the variational fundamental 1-form,
provides non-trivial contributions carried by the ﬁrst order Lie-generators. Probably for this reason, his approach is
usually adopted only for higher-order calculations where ordering mixing does not appear.

In this paper we intend to point out that canonical gyrokinetic variables can be constructed, without ambiguities,
directly in terms a a suitable canonical Lie-transform approach, by appropriate selection of the initial and ﬁnal
canonical states (see path 3 in the enclosed ﬁgure), i.e., respectively x = (q, p) and X′ = (Q′
f ).
The latter are, by construction, gyrokinetic, i.e., the corresponding Hamiltonian equations of motions are independent
of the gyrophase angle f . We want to show that the transformation x → X′ can be realized, in principle with arbitrary
accuracy in e , by means of a canonical Lie transformation of the form:

being w = w (X′, e ) the corresponding Lie generator. In order to achieve this result, we shall start demanding the
following relation between the fundamental differential 1-forms, i.e., the initial and the gyrokinetic Lagrangians, which
can be shown to be of the form:

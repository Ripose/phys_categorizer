Non-trapping arrest of Langmuir wave damping near the threshold amplitude

A. V. Ivanov and Iver H. Cairns
School of Physics, The University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Sydney, Australia

Evolution of a Langmuir wave is studied numerically for ﬁnite amplitudes slightly above the
threshold which separates damping and non-damping cases. Arrest of linear damping is found to
be a second-order eﬀect due to ballistic evolution of perturbations, resonant power transfer between
ﬁeld and particles, and organization of phase space into a positive slope for the average distribution
function fav around the resonant wave phase speed vph. Trapping in the wave potential does not
arrest damping or saturate the subsequent growth phase.

Recently it has been revealed that evolution of a
monochromatic electrostatic Langmuir wave of ﬁnite am-
plitude in a Maxwellian plasma is a threshold phe-
nomenon. Speciﬁcally, a monochromatic wave with ini-
tial amplitude A0 greater than a threshold A⋆
0 does not
obey the exponential “linear” damping predicted by Lan-
dau’s [1] classic theory: after an initial period of ap-
proximately linear damping, the wave amplitude stops
decreasing and starts to grow approximately exponen-
tially before undergoing irregular oscillations in ampli-
tude [2, 3] (Fig. 1). Both the amplitudes and times
at which the wave ﬁrst ceases to damp and grow (la-
belled “arrest” and “saturation”) are not arbitrary but
0) [3],
are power-law functions of the diﬀerence (A0
as expected for second-order phase transitions [4].

The power laws established in [3] are very important.
First, they identify damping of a monochromatic wave
of ﬁnite amplitude as a universality class of critical phe-
nomena. Second, they correspond to a balance between
linear and nonlinear physics: for a Maxwellian plasma the
threshold A⋆
0 is accurately predicted by equating the Lan-
dau damping rate to the nonlinear trapping frequency
ωtr = (kA0e/me)1/2, which depends on the wavenumber
k and electric ﬁeld A0 [3]. (The constant of proportional-
ity is slightly diﬀerent from unity for other thermal plas-
mas [3].) Third, this linear-nonlinear balance is strikingly
diﬀerent from the usual thresholds in plasma physics,
which involve purely linear physics; e.g. the threshold
between stable and unstable states for a bump-on-tail
plasma [5] is predicted by linear instability theory.

Trapping of electrons in a monochromatic wave’s elec-
tric potential is one nonlinear mechanism often suggested
to stop the initial exponential damping phase [6] and to
saturate the wave’s growth. Moreover, some analytic the-
ories predict that trapping causes both a threshold phe-
nomenon and ensuing irregular oscillations [7], modelled
as nonlinear BGK modes with frequencies close to ωtr.

In the frameworks of linear and quasilinear theory [8]
arrest of the linear damping (as well as saturation of
the growth) might be explained in terms of ﬂattening
of the distribution function (DF) at the wave phase ve-
locity vph = ωpe/k, thus bringing the damping (growth)

Trapping is believed to play no role in saturating a ki-
netic instability due to the relatively large bandwidth of
growing waves. However, saturation of a reactive insta-
bility by trapping is also expected to produce a relatively
ﬂat DF when spatially averaged over the trapping whorls
in velocity-position space. This is expected within an

The role of trapping in the threshold phenomenon is
controversial [2, 3, 7, 9], with some workers interpreting
the phenomenon entirely in terms of trapping [2, 7, 9] and
others ﬁnding conﬂicting evidence [3]. Consider the criti-
cal exponents τmin, βmin, τsat and βsat for the power-law

functions of (A0

First, the temporal exponents τmin = 0.901

0.011 are measurably diﬀerent from each

0.07 and
ωtr. Second, the ﬁeld exponents βsat = 1.88
βmin = 2.72
0.09 are remarkably diﬀerent from each
other and the value 2 expected for trapping [10]. These
points argue against trapping causing both, or either of,
the arrest and saturation phenomena. Third, after time
tsat critical slowing causes the electric ﬁeld envelope to
oscillate with a characteristic period which may be sev-
eral orders of magnitude longer than ttr [3, 9]. Fourth,
calculations with A0 well above A⋆
0 lead to τ and β expo-
nents closer to 0.6 and 1.3, respectively, and the oscilla-
tion spectrum has clear peaks near ωtr, suggesting that
trapping plays a role well above threshold [3].

In this Letter we simulate a one-dimensional (1-D)
Vlasov-Poisson (VP) model with initially Maxwellian dis-
tribution and demonstrate that its DF does not corre-
spond to a BGK equilibrium [7] with areas of trapped
and nontrapped motions and a separatrix (chaotic mo-
tions) between them when the wave ﬁrst ceases to damp
or grow. We demonstrate that the initial DF evolves
into a shape that stops the initial Landau damping and
supports the subsequent exponential growth. We also

discrepancies between the evolution which ends with ar-
rest of damping at t = tmin, and the subsequent evo-
lution until the growth saturates at t = tsat. At the
moment t = tmin the phase space portrait reveals no
signs of particle trapping – only ﬁlamentation due to
phase mixing (Fig. 2, the upper view). Moreover, instead
of a stationary state this distribution supports approx-
imately linear (meaning exponential) growth on the in-
terval tmin < t < tsat, as Fig. 1 shows. Crucially, the DF
at tsat does not consist of the closed orbits (or whorls in
velocity-position space) expected for trapping. Instead,
the orbits are still open, although they clearly indicate
progress towards trapping. Trapping is therefore respon-
sible for neither the arrest of damping nor the saturation
of the growth phase.

In the linear theory developed by Landau [1] growth is
due to a positive slope in the DF at the phase velocity of
the wave,

at t = tmin. Instead of the ﬂattening of f0 near the reso-
nant velocities v =
vph predicted by quasilinear theory
[8], f0(v, tmin) acquires a positive slope in a small vicinity
of vph, and therefore can support (approximately) linear
growth after the moment t = tmin as Fig. 1 shows.

Contrary to the situation near t = tmin when damping
ceases and the physics looks quite smooth and regular,
f0 becomes quite irregular at the time t = tsat when

(π, vph), but starts to oscillate irregularly near the unsta-

tinct characteristics that identify the processes responsi-
ble for their appearance and evolution. The bottom panel
of Fig. 6 shows that the turbulent processes responsible
for the (relative) ﬂattening of f0 in the resonant area
near vph start only after tsat, when spatial Fourier com-
ponents Em other than m = 1 become comparable to
E1 (not shown here) due to the power transfer between
them.

An insight into the striking diﬀerence between the crit-
ical exponents βmin and βsat comes from critical phenom-
ena theory: critical exponents depend on the properties
of correlations for a speciﬁc system (e.g., on its dimen-
sionality) and/or a universality class (e.g., Ising, perco-
[15, 16]. Since a 1-D col-
lation, surface growth etc.)
lisionless mean-ﬁeld VP model provides minimal choice,
one explanation for this diﬀerence is that the DFs in full
phase space, which includes the velocity component, are
diﬀerent at the moments tmin and tsat (see Figs 2–6 –
this is contrary to the idea that trapping explains both
the arrest and saturation phases, which should result in
the same exponents. Some plausibility for velocity-space
structures having this eﬀect follows from calculations for
a similar system (1-D VP self-gravitating): varying the
resolution in v seriously aﬀected estimates of the “trap-
ping scaling” exponent β = 2 [17].

In summary, we studied the VP model for initial Lang-
muir wave amplitudes slightly above the threshold that
separates damping and non-damping evolution. The
phase space diagnostics shows that there are no signs

of ﬂattening of the distribution function at t = tmin
– instead the combined eﬀects of ballistic evolution of
vph
perturbations and resonant power transfer at
are responsible for arrest of the linear (Landau) damp-
ing then. Since the spatially-averaged DF is not ﬂat at
tmin but instead has a positive slope in vicinity of the
resonant velocity vph, this state is not stationary and
is followed by subsequent (linear) growth which is sat-
urated at t = tsat. The saturation time tsat marks the
boundary between the regular evolution of electric ﬁeld
and stochastic one. Trapping in the wave potential does
not arrest damping or saturate the subsequent growth
phase.

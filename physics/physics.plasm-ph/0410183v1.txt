Abstract. The external and independent control of plasma ﬂow velocity shears
parallel and perpendicular to magnetic ﬁeld lines is realized using segmented
collisionless-plasma sources. Electrostatic ion-cyclotron instabilities are observed to be
suppressed by the perpendicular ﬂow velocity shears, the suppression physics of which
is found to be distinguished into two aspects. On the other hand, the parallel ﬂow
velocity shears are demonstrated to destabilize the ion-cyclotron instabilities depending
on the sign of the parallel shear in the absence of ﬁeld-aligned electron drift ﬂow.

1. Introduction

Investigations of magnetic-ﬁeld-aligned (parallel) and transverse (perpendicular)
sheared plasma ﬂows have been widely performed in connection with the excitation or
the suppression of plasma ﬂuctuations and turbulences, which are considered to generate
energetic particles and induce cross-ﬁeld transport in fusion-oriented and space plasmas.
In basic laboratory experiments, a number of works on each of the ﬂow shears have been
reported. In the parallel shear case, some experimental investigations related to parallel-
ﬂow-shear driven instabilities, such as the D’Angelo mode [1], ion-acoustic [2, 3], drift-
wave [4], and ion-cyclotron [5,6] instabilities, have been performed in various situations.
In the perpendicular shear case, on the other hand, many experimental investigations
on the relation between the perpendicular ﬂow shears and the instabilities, such as
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) [7], inhomogeneous energy density driven (IEDD) [8, 9], drift-
mode [10, 11], and ﬂute-mode [12] instabilities, have been performed.

Although an instability in the ion-cyclotron range of frequencies, which plays an
important role in heating of ions, plasma cross-ﬁeld diﬀusion, and anomalous resistivity
in space plasmas, has been investigated for the case of the IEDD instability and is
reported to be excited by the perpendicular shear, this IEDD instability is treated as
diﬀerent from the conventional ion-cyclotron instability [8]. Originally, the ion-cyclotron
instability was reported to be driven by an electron current generated along magnetic-
ﬁeld lines in a plasma column with a positively biased small electrode immersed in
the plasma, which is called as the current-driven ion cyclotron instability [13–15]. On
the other hand, Hatakeyama et al. pointed out an importance of two-dimensional
potential structure near the small electrode [16–18], which gives rise to a two-dimensional
relaxation oscillation of ions in a magnetized plasma. This relaxation oscillation is

called as “potential-driven ion-cyclotron oscillation” and is distinguished from the above
“current-driven instability”.

Since the eﬀects of the ﬂow velocity shears on these two types of ion-cyclotron
instabilities have not been investigated yet, it is signiﬁcant to clarify these eﬀects for
the understanding of dynamical ion processes in the space plasmas. Thus, we here
focus upon the characteristics of the ion-cyclotron instabilities modiﬁed by the parallel
and perpendicular ﬂow velocity shears which are actively controlled using our newly
developed plasma source.

2. Experimental Setup

Experiments are performed in the QT−Upgrade machine of Tohoku university. In
the case of perpendicular ﬂow velocity shear experiments, a plasma is produced by the
surface ionization of potassium atoms on a 10.0-cm-diameter tungsten (W) hot plate
under a magnetic ﬁeld of B = 3 kG in a single-ended Q machine as shown in Fig. 1.
The hot plate is concentrically segmented into three section, each of which is electrically
isolated and is individually biased. Thus, the radially-diﬀerent plasma potential, i.e.,
radial electric ﬁeld is generated even in the fully-ionized collisionless plasma. Hereinafter,
the hot-plate electrodes set in order from the center to the outside are called as the ﬁrst,
second, and third electrodes and voltages applied to them are deﬁned as VH1, VH2, and
VH3, respectively. VH3 is kept at 0 V throughout this paper. A small radially movable
Langmuir probe is used to measure radial proﬁles of plasma parameters. Here, the
axial position z is deﬁned as the distance from the hot plate (z = 0 cm) toward a glass
end plate located at z = 170 cm, which terminates the plasma column. The plasma
is produced almost within the second electrode and the plasma density np is about
109 cm−3 at the radial center, gradually decreasing toward the outside. Electron Te and
ion Ti temperatures are around 0.2 eV and their proﬁles are almost uniform in the radial
direction. In order to investigate eﬀects of the perpendicular shear on the instabilities
in the ion-cyclotron frequency range, a small disk electrode, the diameter of which is
2 mm, is inserted at the center of the plasma cross section around z = 150 cm (see
Fig. 1), which has been known to excite the ion-cyclotron instabilities by changing a

bias voltage VD applied to the electrode [14–18].

In the case of parallel ﬂow shear experiments, on the other hand, a plasma is
produced by a modiﬁed plasma synthesis method, where potassium ion and electron
emitters are oppositely set at cylindrical machine ends under a strong magnetic ﬁeld of
B = 1.6 kG [19]. The ion emitter is the same as the hot plate in the perpendicular ﬂow
shear experiment and the electron emitter using a 10.8-cm-diameter nickel plate coated
with barium oxide (BaO) is additionally mounted at a distance of 170 cm from the ion
emitter, which is the principal feature in the parallel shear experiment. A negatively
biased stainless (Sus) grid, the voltage of which is typically Vg = −60 V, is installed at
a distance of 10 cm from the ion emitter surface. Since the grid reﬂects the electrons
ﬂowing from the electron emitter, an electron velocity distribution function parallel to
the magnetic ﬁeld is considered to become Maxwellian, namely there is no electron drift
ﬂow. In this synthesized plasma, the electron emitter is negatively biased at typically
Vee ≃ −4.0 V, which determines the plasma potential φ, and thus, a voltage applied
to the ion emitter can control the potential diﬀerence between the plasma and the ion
emitter. This potential diﬀerence can accelerate the ions and generate the ﬁeld-aligned
ion ﬂow. Since the ion emitter is concentrically segmented into three sections, each
of which is electrically isolated and is individually biased (Vie1, Vie2, Vie3) as mentioned
above, the ﬁeld-aligned ion ﬂows with radially-diﬀerent energies, i.e., ion ﬂow velocity
shears, are expected to be generated in the radially-uniform plasma potential [19].

3. Experimental Results and Discussion

3.1. Perpendicular ﬂow velocity shear

First, we investigate the eﬀects of the perpendicular ﬂow velocity shear on the
ion-cyclotron instability, which is excited by the positively biased (VD = 90 V) small
disk electrode. Figure 2(a) shows frequency spectra of an electron current ID ﬂowing
to the small disk electrode as a function of VH1 for VH2 = 0 V at r = 0 cm. When
ID is increased by changing VD, ﬂuctuations in the regions of ion-cyclotron frequency
(ωci/2π = 116 kHz at B = 3 kG) and its multiplied frequencies are excited.
It is
conﬁrmed that the ﬂuctuation frequencies ω/2π shift with an increase in magnetic-
ﬁeld strength and correspond to the ion-cyclotron and harmonic frequencies (ω ≃ nωci,
n = 1, 2, 3, · · ·). These ion-cyclotron instabilities are excited in the absence of the
perpendicular shear for VH1 = 0 V, and are gradually suppressed with an increase or a
decrease in VH1.

Normalized ﬂuctuation amplitudes ˜ID/ ¯ID of the electron current for VD = 90 V
as a function of VH1 for VH2 = 0 V is presented in Fig. 2(b).
In the case of the
doubled-frequency mode (n=2) with ω/2π ≃ 240 kHz, the ﬂuctuation amplitude ˜ID/ ¯ID
increases with an increase in VH1 and has the maximum value for VH1 ≃ +0.2 V, where
the generated hill-shaped radial potential proﬁle forms the slight perpendicular ﬂow
velocity shear. This ﬂuctuation is found to be gradually stabilized with an increase or
a decrease in VH1 which starts from +0.2 V, and is almost suppressed for VH1 = ±1 V.
Gavrishchaka et al. reported that the theoretical growth rate increases with an increase
in the perpendicular ﬂow velocity shear and gradually decrease with a further increase in
the shear [20]. The ion-cyclotron instability treated in the theory of Gavrishchaka et al.
is concluded to be destabilized by the combination of a magnetic-ﬁeld-aligned electron
current and a localized transverse electric ﬁeld, i.e., perpendicular velocity shear, which

suggests that the current-driven type instability is enhanced by the slight velocity shear
and suppressed by the large velocity shear. Since our experimental results in the case of
n=2 mode clearly show the same tendency as the above theoretical growth rate, the ion-
cyclotron instability excited by the weak velocity shear is identiﬁed as the current-driven
type instability and is found to be suppressed by the large velocity shear.

In the case of the fundamental ion-cyclotron mode (n=1) with ω/2π ≃ 120 kHz, on
the other hand, the ion-cyclotron instability is excited and has the maximum ﬂuctuation
amplitude for VH1 = 0 V, which signiﬁes the ﬂat radial potential, i.e., the absence of the
velocity shear. This instability is gradually suppressed with an increase or a decrease
in VH1, i.e., the shear suppression is symmetrical with respect to VH1 = 0 V, which is
distinctly diﬀerent from the case of n=2 mode. Since the eﬀect of the shear on this
instability cannot be explained by the conventional theory for the current-driven type
instability, our attention is directed to another concept of ion-cyclotron instability called
as the potential-driven type instability [16–18]. This type of instability is caused by not
the current along magnetic-ﬁeld lines but the two-dimensional potential structure just
in front of the small disk electrode leading to the synchronized periodic ion gyro-motion.
When the perpendicular shear is generated, the trajectory of the ion is distorted by the
shear and the period of the ion gyro-motion is changed. Therefore, the suppression of
the potential-driven type ion-cyclotron instability by the perpendicular shear can be
understood in terms of the decorrelation of the synchronized periodic ion gyro-motion.
This implies that the potential-driven type instability has the maximum ﬂuctuation
amplitude in the absence of the perpendicular ﬂow velocity shear.

3.2. Parallel ﬂow velocity shear

Fig. 3(b) indicates the value of Vie1 corresponding to the absence of the parallel shear. It
is to be noted that the plasma density in the case of parallel shear experiment is about
108 cm−3 which is a few times smaller than that in the perpendicular shear case. As
a result, the ion-cyclotron instability is not excited at Vie1 = Vie2 even for VD = 90 V.
When Vie1 is positively biased, however, the ﬂuctuation in the ion-cyclotron frequency
range begins to grow at Vie1 ≃ 1.8 V (A: open circles) and ˜ID/ ¯ID gradually increases.
This ˜ID/ ¯ID has the maximum value at Vie1 ≃ 3.2 V, and decreases for larger Vie1. Since
this phenomenon is similar to the dependence of the drift-wave instability on the parallel
shear, the ion-cyclotron instability is also enhanced by the parallel shear in the same
mechanism as the case of the drift-wave instability as described in Ref. [4].

From the results of the frequency spectra, the frequencies of the ﬂuctuation are
found to be slightly smaller (A: open circles) and larger (B: closed circles) than the
ion-cyclotron frequency (≃ 63 kHz at B = 1.6 kG). This frequency shift is considered
to be caused by the shear eﬀects and is now analyzed by using the kinetic dispersion
relation.

4. Conclusion

Our experiments demonstrate that the ion-cyclotron instabilities are suppressed
by the perpendicular ﬂow velocity shear. In addition, it is found that the suppression
mechanisms of the instabilities are diﬀerent between the current-driven type and the
potential-driven type, which are selectively excited by the bias voltage applied to the
small disk electrode.

In the case of the parallel ﬂow velocity shear experiments, on the other hand, the
ion-cyclotron instabilities are found to be excited by the parallel shear depending on the
sign of the shear. The ﬂuctuation amplitude is observed to increase with increasing the

shear strength, but the instability is found to be gradually stabilized when the shear
strength exceeds the critical value.

Based on the results mentioned above,

it is concluded that the plasma ﬂow
velocity shears in the magnetized plasma are important for controlling the ion-cyclotron
instabilities, where the parallel and perpendicular shears play diﬀerent roles in these
instabilities, respectively.

Threshold of parametric decay instability
accompanying electron Bernstein wave heating in
spherical tokamaks

Abstract. The parametric instability of upper hybrid wave decay into back scattered
upper hybrid wave and lower hybrid wave is considered for conditions of inhomogeneous
plasma of spherical tokamaks. The possibility of absolute instability is demonstrated
It is shown that the threshold
and the corresponding threshold is determined.
power increases with pump frequency and electron temperature. Threshold power
is estimated for typical parameters of experiment in MAST tokamak. It is shown that
in this case parametrical reﬂection arises, if probing power exceeds 129 W/cm2, which
gives 40 kW for a beam of 10 cm radius.

1. Introduction

In recent years, considerable attention of the controlled fusion community has been
paid to spherical tokamaks (ST). These are small aspect ratio devices with typically
high plasma density and comparatively low magnetic ﬁeld. This ST feature has strong
eﬀect on the electromagnetic wave propagation.
In the microwave frequency region,
characteristic surfaces, like the upper hybrid resonance and the cut-oﬀ are very close to
the plasma edge. As a result, the electromagnetic (EM) waves are unable to penetrate
into the plasma interior. The only way to overcome this diﬃculty is to use the
linear conversion of the incident EM wave into the electron Bernstein wave (EBW)
occurring in the upper hybrid resonance (UHR). The latter has no density limitations
and can, in principle, carry the radio frequency power deep into the plasma. This
mechanism of wave conversion has been successfully demonstrated to produce heating
in over dense plasmas in the W7-AS stellarator [3]. The plasma heating experiment
based on this scheme is in progress now in the MAST tokamak at Culham, UK. The
wave propagation, conversion in the UHR and absorption is usually accompanied, in
100 kW power level experiments, by nonlinear eﬀects, in particular, by parametric decay
instabilities (Versator [1], FT-1 [2], W7-AS [3]). These instabilities lead to redistribution
of incident power between plasma species and can cause anomalous reﬂection, especially
when excited at the plasma edge.

Threshold of parametric decay instability. . .

The present paper is devoted to analysis of the decay instability thresholds and
growth rates for speciﬁc conditions of low magnetic ﬁeld typical for ST. The study is
focused upon the decay of UH wave into another UH wave and intermediate frequency
range wave satisfying the lower hybrid resonance condition, which was observed in the
UHR heating experiments mentioned above. The inﬂuence of plasma inhomogeneity on
its threshold is investigated for backscattering of the incident UH wave. Dependence
of the decay instability threshold on the pump frequency, necessary for the heating
experiment optimization, is studied.

The paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 we deduce equations, describing
the decay of the incident high-frequency UH wave into UH wave and low-frequency LH
ℓ′
U H + ℓLH, and consider them in WKB approximation. In section 3 we
wave: ℓU H →
calculate an absolute instability threshold, which corresponds to UH wave induced back
scattering instability. Brief discussion follows in section 4.

2. Equations for wave amplitudes

We use slab plasma model, i.e. density and magnetic ﬁeld gradients are assumed to
be along x axe. A magnetic ﬁeld direction is chosen along z axe. We consider one
dimensional problem of pump wave parametric decay. UH pump wave is supposed to be
excited by external antenna via tunnelling eﬀect (X
B scheme according to [4]), and
assumed to propagate in x direction. We consider here the high pump frequency case,
when the frequency is larger than doubled electron cyclotron frequency, corresponding
to the magnetic ﬁeld in UHR: ω0 > 2ωce. In this case the UH pump wave dispersion
curve (see ﬁgure 1) does not possess a turning point and transformation to Bernstein
wave occurs without change of group velocity sign.

→

By indices 0, 1, 2 we will mark frequency, wavenumber, complex amplitudes of the
electric ﬁelds and potentials of the pump wave, parametrically reﬂected UH wave and
LH wave correspondingly.

One can see from (10),(11), (12) that in the probing frequency range under consideration
ω0 > 2ωce, which is used at present for EBW heating in MAST, there is no change of
the group velocity sign in the UHR point. The transformation point of LH wave, which
is shifted from LH resonance position (where ε(ω2) = 0), is the turning point of LH
wave, and group velocity changes the sign there. Corresponding dispersion curves are
represented in ﬁgure 1. We consider the most interesting case of k0 > 0, k1 < 0, when the
group velocity directions give rise to positive feedback loop, which can lead to absolute
decay instability [7, 8, 9, 10].

We consider equations (6), (9) in WKB approximation, substituting

3. Absolute instability threshold

Absolute instability can arise, when decay conditions (5) allow two decay points x1,2 to
exist, and the group velocities directions provide positive feedback loop. In this case,
according to [9, 10], the absolute instability threshold is determined by the following

To calculate the decay instability threshold we act in accordance with following
procedure. We calculate the terms, involved in (14) using (15), and then substitute
them to (14), obtaining an equation for threshold power.

At ﬁrst we calculate the decay point coordinates x1,2. It should be noted that the
UHR position xU H (ω1) of the parametrically reﬂected UH wave is shifted in respect to
the UHR position of the pump wave xU H (ω0). This shift can be estimated as

4. Discussion

At ﬁrst we discuss the approximations used. Our analysis is performed in WKB
approximation, which holds true, when two following conditions are satisﬁed:

•

Decay points x1,2 are situated far enough from LH wave turning point x∗. More
accurately, taking into account that electric ﬁeld of LH wave in the vicinity of the
turning point can be expressed in terms of Airy function, it can be written as

x1,2

x∗ ≫

and the condition (21) can be shown to be satisﬁed even for Φ = 2π.

•

Length of decay region is not larger than Airy scale, which provides that all decay
region is situated far enough from the turning point. The coherence region size (19)
can be estimated as ℓ

The distance between extraordinary wave cut-oﬀ and UHR, which can be estimated
as

should be much larger than pump wavelength in the decay region. The last can be

This criterion is rather strict due to low magnetic ﬁeld, which is typical for ST. But

Our consideration, which is based on the formulae (14), seems to be sensitive to
the possibility to consider decay points as separate ampliﬁers of the incident wave. The

Comparing that with (22), one obtains that (23) can be satisﬁed for Φ = 2π in rather
narrow range of parameters. But, actually, an accurate analysis shows, that for the
dispersion curves behavior, which in the region in question can be approximated as
in ﬁgure 2, the decay points joint inﬂuence is the same as given by our consideration.

5. Conclusion

In the paper absolute instability of parametrical reﬂection of upper hybrid wave is
analyzed in WKB approximation. The reﬂection is assumed to be accompanied by
radiation of lower hybrid wave. Equations, describing the decay, obtained in kρ-
approximation. The decay threshold is determined. It is shown that threshold power
increases with pump frequency and electron temperature. Threshold power is estimated
for typical parameters of experiment in MAST tokamak. It is shown that in this case
parametrical reﬂection arises, if probing power exceeds 129 W/cm2, which gives 40 kW
in a beam of 10 cm radius.

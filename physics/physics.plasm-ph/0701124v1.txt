The strong inﬂuence of the electron dynamics provides the possibility of controlling the expansion
of laser-produced plasmas by appropriately shaping the laser pulse. A simple irradiation scheme is
proposed to tailor the explosion of large deuterium clusters, inducing the formation of shock struc-
tures, capable of driving nuclear fusion reactions. Such a scenario has been thoroughly investigated,
resorting to two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Furthermore, the intricate dy-
namics of ions and electrons during the collisionless expansion of spherical nanoplasmas has been
analyzed in detail using a self-consistent ergodic-kinetic model. This study clariﬁes the transition
from hydrodynamic-like to Coulomb-explosion regimes.

INTRODUCTION

The rapid developments in laser technology in recent years, both in the IR [1] and VUV/X frequency range [2],
disclosed new research realms in the ﬁeld of radiation-matter interactions. Among these, the interaction of ultraintense
lasers with jets of atomic or molecular clusters has become a central research topic [3]. Experiments with laser-cluster
interactions have demonstrated tabletop nuclear fusion [4, 5], opening the way to compact neutron sources; recent
studies also suggest the use of the laser-cluster scheme for laboratory investigations of nucleosynthesis reactions,
relevant in astrophysical studies [6].

A clustered gas beam can be obtained through adiabatic expansion of a dense gas jet into a vacuum [7, 8], with
the gas backing pressure and the temperature determining the mean cluster size (typically, in the range 1 nm - 1
µm). Such a medium can be regarded as a sparse distribution of tiny solid-like targets, a peculiar conﬁguration that
allows for a deep penetration of the laser radiation and a strong laser-matter coupling with many individual, overdense
targets: this guarantees an extremely eﬃcient absorption of the radiation (nearly the entire laser energy deposited
within a few millimeters propagation length [9]).

When an ultraintense laser beam hits a cluster, the leading edge of the pulse promptly ionizes the neutral atoms
(cf. Ref. [10] for a detailed analysis of the concurring ionization mechanism in diﬀerent laser/cluster conﬁgurations),
forming a dense distribution of ionized matter (usually called a nanoplasma) [3, 11]. Then, the electrons are further
heated by the main part of the pulse and the plasma starts to expand, leading to eﬃcient ion acceleration, as ﬁrst
predicted by Dawson [J. M. Dawson, “On the production of plasmas by giant laser pulses”, Phys. Fluids 7 pp. 981-
987 (1964)]. For small, low-Z clusters (e.g., nm-sized Hydrogen or Deuterium clusters) exposed to extremely intense
laser radiation, the electrons can even be completely stripped from the cluster in a few optical cycles, leading to the
Coulomb explosion (CE) of the remaining bare-ion distribution. With IR lasers, this happens when the excursion
a0/(1 + a2
length of the electrons [c/ωl arcsin
, with ωl and a0 as central frequency and normalized vector potential
0)
of the laser, respectively] is much higher than both the electron skin depth (c/ωpe, ωpe being the electron plasma
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
frequency) and the initial radius of the cluster, R0 [12]. In more general situations, when a relevant fraction of the
electrons is bound to the cluster, the expansion process is strongly dependent on the self-consistent dynamics of ions
and trapped electrons: when increasing the laser energy or when lowering the cluster size, the expansion conditions
vary smoothly from quasi-neutral, hydrodynamic-like regimes to pure CE regimes, as revealed by particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations [12, 13] of laser-cluster interactions and detailed kinetic analysis of the expansion [14]. This suggests the
possibility of exploiting the electron dynamics in order to achieve control over the expansion, which can be done by
appropriately shaping the laser pulses. For example, large-scale shock shells (multi-branched structures in the ion
phase space, previously predicted by Kaplan, Dubetsky, and Shkolnikov [15] for nonuniform CEs) can be driven and
controlled by using a proper sequence of two laser pulses having diﬀerent intensities [16]; this opens the way toward
intracluster fusion reactions within large Deuterium or Deuterium-Tritium clusters [15, 17].

The present paper is organized as follows. After brieﬂy introducing the concept of shock shells in a Coulomb

explosion (Sec. II A), the description of a double-pump irradiation scheme (Sec. II B) for inducing and controlling
shock shells capable of driving intracluster nuclear reactions (Sec. II C) is given, whereas Sec. II D investigates the
possibility of controlling expansions also with VUV/X-ray beams. Section III is devoted to the kinetic analysis of
spherical plasma expansions, performed with a novel ergodic-kinetic model (Sec. III A): selected results obtained with
this model are presented in Sec. III B.

The explosion dynamics of a spherical distribution of cold ions is described by the equation for the radial motion

of the ions,

where ri(r0, t) denotes the trajectory of an ion starting at t = 0 from radius r0 with zero radial velocity, M is the ion
mass, qi = Ze is the ion charge, and Ni(r, t) is the number of ions enveloped at time t by a sphere of radius r. When

starting from a uniform ion density (equal to ni0 for r 6 R0), the repulsive electric ﬁeld grows linearly for r < R0,
reaching its maximum at the outer boundary (Fig. 1a), and causing the outer ions to be always faster than the inner
ones. In such a particular situation, ions never overtake each other, Ni(r, t) is conserved along the ion trajectories (so
is the total energy of each ion), and Eq. (1) can be integrated analytically [15, 18]: assuming all ions to be initially

is the asymptotic cutoﬀ energy. Such solutions could be obtained equivalently from cold-ﬂuid equations (v being
now the ﬂuid velocity). However, when nonuniform density proﬁles are considered, the kinetic aspects of the process
immediately reveal themselves and the features of the expansion change dramatically, as ﬁrst predicted in Ref. [15],
and explored in self-consistent simulations in Refs. [16, 17]. In fact, if the initial density is a decreasing function of
r, the repulsive Coulomb ﬁeld reaches its maximum within the ion sphere [13, 15] (cf. Fig. 1b), causing some inner
ions to accelerate more than the outer ions in front of them: this ultimately leads to overtaking between ions and the
formation of a shock shell. In this situation, the ion trajectories are no longer independent of one another, Ni(r, t)
is not conserved along the ion trajectories (nor is the total energy of each ion), and Eq. (1) no longer admits the
analytical solutions reported above. Figure 2 shows a typical nonuniform expansion (similar to that illustrated in Ref.
[15], Fig. 1), starting from the smoothly-decreasing proﬁle of Fig. 1b: the phase-space proﬁle starts bending on the
right until it becomes multivalued, and a pronounced three-branched shock shell forms (cf. Fig. 2a). As predicted
by the theory [15], vertical-tangent points in the phase-space proﬁle correspond to a singularity in the ion density
(cf. Fig. 2b) (such singularity is sometimes called a caustic [19], using a term borrowed from astrophysics [20]), while
horizontal-tangent points correspond to a singularity in the energy distribution (cf. Fig. 2c); this appears at the very
beginning of the expansion and it is sometimes called the shock predictor [15], since it indicates the presence of a
maximum in the velocity proﬁle. As the expansion continues, the shock shell widens radially, involving an ever larger
portion of the ion cloud. The physical interest of such pronounced, large-scale shock shells resides in the appearance
of large relative velocities within a single exploding cluster, which can lead to energetic ion-ion collisions, thus opening
the way to intracluster nuclear fusion reactions [15, 16, 17] (e.g., in the case of D or D-T clusters).

B. The double-pump technique

4

An eﬃcient strategy for producing large-scale shock shells in a controlled fashion is the combination of diﬀerent
expansion regimes. In fact, if a slow, hydrodynamic-like expansion is exploited to provide a decreasing density proﬁle,
then a subsequent, abrupt CE naturally leads to the formation of a shock shell, according to the dynamics described
in Sec. II A. Such a slow-expansion/abrupt-explosion dynamics can be obtained rather simply, by irradiating a cluster
with two sequential pulses having diﬀerent intensities, namely, a weaker pulse followed (after a proper time delay)
by a much stronger one, as sketched in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst pulse must be intense enough to ionize the atoms, creating
a nanoplasma, but no so intense as to expel a signiﬁcant fraction of the electrons from the cluster core:
in these
conditions, a slow expansion takes place, in a quasineutral, hydrodynamic-like regime, and a smoothly decreasing
density proﬁle is formed. The second pulse must be extremely intense, in order to strip all the electrons from the
cluster, thus driving a CE. The eﬀectiveness of this double-pump technique has been demonstrated [16, 17] by

extremely intense pulse (peak intensity 2.5
in the x direction, being linearly polarized along the y direction. Figures 4 and 5 show the evolution of the ion density
distribution and the ion phase-space proﬁle, respectively, during the CE stage. When the second pulse hits the plasma
sphere (cf. Fig. 4a), the outer ions are expanding slowly, under the pressure of the hot electrons, while the cluster core
is still dense, with the inner ions still at rest (cf. Fig. 5). As a result, when the electrons are suddenly swept away by
the second laser, the inner ions experience a much higher repulsive force than the outer ions do, so that they rapidly
overrun them, leading to the formation of a large, pronounced shock shell, clearly visible in both ion density (Fig.
4a) and phase space (Fig. 5). In this example, the relative velocities between ions belonging to diﬀerent branches in
the shock shell would allow for collision energies as high as 200 keV, which is enough for eﬃcient DD fusion to occur.

C. Fusion reactions within single exploding clusters

The ability of generating pronounced shock shells involving high relative velocities within single exploding clusters
makes the phenomenon attractive as a possible way to induce nuclear reactions. As already pointed out in Ref.
[15], the rates for intracluster reactions can be much higher than those for intercluster reactions, because the typical
1022 cm−3) can be much higher than those within the hot plasma ﬁlament
densities within a shock shell (. ni0
1019 cm−3. However, it is crucial to consider also that a
resulting from the exploded clusters, whose density is
10 fs), much shorter than the typical disassembly
shock shell stays appreciably dense only for a very brief time (
time of the plasma ﬁlament (
[17], the intracluster-reaction rates exhibit
a sharp, time-resolved peak right after the shock-shell formation. In order to compute the actual number of shock-
driven, intracluster fusion reactions, it is necessary to sum up all possible contributions from collisions between ions
belonging to diﬀerent velocity branches. The number of reactions per unit time and volume,

D. Expansion control with intense VUV/X-ray beams

∼

The possible use of the double-pump technique also with VUV/X-ray radiation is currently being investigated. With
very short wavelengths, the expulsion of electrons from the cluster, which is necessary for a Coulomb explosion to
occur, depends essentially on the ionization dynamics and much less on the electron motion in the radiation ﬁeld [since
now the electron excursion length (
c/ωl) is very small compared to the typical cluster radius]. Thus, the full details
of the ionization processes involved in this situation (e.g., photoionization, Auger decay, collisional ionization, and
strong ﬁeld ionization) must be considered. For example, when the main ionization process is the photoelectric eﬀect
(as in D clusters), the mean energy acquired by the electrons is approximately equal to the photon energy, ǫγ = hν. A
Coulomb explosion can occur if the number of photons hitting the cluster is suﬃcient to ionize most of the atoms, and
ǫγ is higher than the electrostatic potential well generated by the ions. This suggests that a double-pump technique
can still be employed to drive a shock shell, even though the physical mechanisms it relies on are diﬀerent. In fact,
the goal of the ﬁrst, weak pulse is now to ionize a small fraction of the atoms in the cluster, in order to drive a slow
expansion, whereas the second, strong pulse must ionize all the atoms remaining in the cluster core, causing a sudden
explosion. In these conditions, a shock shell forms because some of the ions created by the second pulse overtake
the slowly expanding ions, provided that appropriate radiation intensities and delay between pulses are employed. In

FIG. 6: Ion phase-space proﬁle at times t1 = 160 fs, t2 = 250 fs, t3 = 390 fs, and t4 = 460 fs. The computational domain is
a cube with a 1.2 µm side (256x256x256 cells), and 125 particles per cell per species have been used (in the region initially
occupied by the cluster).

order to test the eﬀectiveness of this technique, PIC simulations have been used [21], which describe the evolution
of the cluster given the initial distributions for the electron and ion populations. This approach is valid whenever
the ionization time is short with respect to the expansion time scale, which is usually a good approximation for the
intense light sources available in the VUV/X-ray energy range. The formation of a pronounced shock shell, obtained
using this technique, is shown in Fig. 6, referring to an ideal situation in which it is assumed that a deuterium cluster
(initial radius R0 = 30 nm, density n0 = 1022 cm−3) undergoes ionization processes which lead to the formation of a
population of N0/3 electrons (where N0 is the number of initially neutral atoms) with 12.4 keV energy, followed by a
second population of 2N0/3 electrons with equal energy, after a 150 fs delay. We observe that at ultra high intensities
in XUV/X-ray sources the ionization dynamics is poorly understood since strong ﬁeld ionization and stabilization
against this mechanism may come into play [22]. The balance between the photoelectric, strong ﬁeld ionization and
stabilization processes must be analyzed in order to obtain the correct picture for the energy distribution of the
electrons (which actually determines the dynamics of the explosion). The analysis of double-pump scenarios, taking
into account the full dynamics of ionization, with beam conﬁgurations available at LCLS and XFEL and with diﬀerent
cluster constituents will be presented in future publications.

III. KINETIC ANALYSIS OF SPHERICAL PLASMA EXPANSIONS

The possibility of controlling the expansion by acting on the amount of energy transferred from the radiation to
the electrons stresses the need for a deep understanding of the physics of the electron-driven collisionless expansion of
spherical, nm-sized plasmas, composed of cold ions and hot electrons. This is also crucial for particular applications,
such as the biomolecular imaging with ultrashort X-ray pulses [23], where sample damage before the imaging time
must be avoided.

Since the ﬁrst experiments on laser-cluster interactions were performed [5], it has been debated [11, 24] whether
the cluster expansions were driven mainly by the pressure of the hot electrons (hydrodynamic-like regime) or by the
strong repulsive ﬁeld which forms when a large fraction of the electrons leave the ion core (CE). Actually, these two
expansion regimes are just two opposite limits resulting from the same physical process, namely the formation of a
repulsive electric ﬁeld due to energetic electrons trying to escape from the cold-ion core. When the kinetic energy of
the electrons is very small compared to the electrostatic energy stored in the ion core, the electric ﬁeld is localized at
the ion front [11, 25, 26], the whole cluster being approximately neutral, and the expansion is hydrodynamic-like; on
the contrary, when the kinetic energy of the electrons is much higher than the ion electrostatic energy, most of the
electrons are free to escape and the CE of the ion sphere takes place. However, in a general scenario, the dynamics
will be a mixture of the phenomenology of the two limits, and a kinetic description is necessary in order to capture
the detailed features of each particular regime.

A. Ergodic model

In order to analyze accurately the dynamics of the expansion in any intermediate situation, we have developed
a new kinetic model, which allows for a clear identiﬁcation of the transition from the hydrodynamic expansion to
the CE regime, thus setting the range of validity for the CE approximation [14]. Based on the assumptions that
the electrons are nonrelativistic and that the time scale for their motion is much shorter than the time scale for the
ion motion, the model describes the expansion dynamics self-consistently by following the radial motion of the ions,
whereas treating the evolution of the electron distribution as a sequence of equilibrium conﬁgurations, represented
by stationary solutions of the Vlasov equation for the electrons. In the case of ideal, spherical symmetry, the general
stationary solution is a function of the Hamiltonian H and of the absolute value of the angular momentum, ℓ, which are
constants of motion of the system. However, and by noticing that possible perturbations to the spherical symmetry
would rapidly break the ℓ-conservation, while leaving the H -conservation unaltered, the distribution function in
equilibrium can be assumed to depend on H only, i.e., the system can be assumed to be ergodic. Accordingly, the
electron density in equilibrium with the electrostatic potential Φ can be written as

where ρ is the energy distribution of the electrons and

closed set of equations describing the plasma expansion, one still needs a rule to update the equilibrium conﬁguration
when the ion motion is considered. Since the variations of Φ induced by the ion motion are slow when compared with
the time scale for the electron motion, the theory of adiabatic invariants for time varying Hamiltonians is used. Here,
the appropriate invariant is the ergodic invariant (cf., for example, Ref. [27])

where Eqs. (8a) and (8e), determining the evolution of the ion trajectories ri(r0, t) and the electron energies ǫ(ǫ0, t) (ǫ0
being the initial energy), are coupled with the nonlinear Poisson equation, which provides the self-consistent Φ(r, t)
(here, Φ is set to zero at inﬁnity, so that ǫ < 0 for trapped electrons). In Eq. (8d), the relation ρ(ǫ, t)dǫ = ρ0(ǫ0)dǫ0
has been used, ρ0(ǫ0) being the initial energy distribution of the electrons. Equation (8c) expresses the ion density
in terms of the Lagrangian coordinate r0, under the hypothesis of no ion overtaking (∂ri/∂r0
= 0) [15] (when shock
shells are present, a more complicated expression has to be used [13]). The solution of Eqs. (8) requires the knowledge
of ni0(r0) and ρ0(ǫ0). Depending on the physical problem considered, the determination of ρ0(ǫ0) can be nontrivial.
This is precisely the case when considering expansions starting from an initially neutral distribution (ne = Zni, and
Φ = 0 everywhere) with hot Maxwellian electrons, having temperature T0, because such conﬁguration is far from
equilibrium. In that case, the plasma expansion can be regarded as a sequence of two distinct processes: ﬁrst, a
rapid expansion of the electrons is observed, which leads to a VP equilibrium conﬁguration before the ions move
appreciably; second, a slow expansion of the plasma bulk is observed. While the latter stage can be certainly analyzed
using Eqs. (8), a diﬀerent procedure must be used to determine the equilibrium conﬁguration following the ﬁrst stage
[in order to obtain the correct form of ρ0(ǫ0)]. To this purpose, the actual charging transient described by the full
VP model is replaced by a virtual charging transient, in which an external potential barrier, initially conﬁning the
electrons, is gradually moved from R0 to inﬁnity, with a series of small radial displacements. Each time the barrier
is moved farther (from Rw to Rw + δRw), the new self-consistent potential (Φ + δΦ) and electron energy (ǫ + δǫ)
have to be calculated. In order to mimic an expansion into a vacuum (which the real transient is), direct energy
exchanges between the electrons and the expanding barrier (expansion work) must be avoided. This is accomplished
by expressing the energy variation δǫ as

Rw

δǫ =

δΦP (r, ǫ; Φ) dr.

Although formally identical to Eq. (8e), Eq. (9) is not equivalent to the conservation of the ergodic invariant (which
would bring on an extra term in the expression for δǫ, accounting for the expansion work). The variations δΦ and
δǫ are determined by simultaneously solving Eqs. (8b) and (9) with a suitable iterative scheme. Once coupled with
this procedure, which provides the initial conditions ρ0(ǫ0), Eqs. (8) constitute a self-consistent model describing
the collisionless expansion of spherical nanoplasmas, starting from an initially neutral distribution composed of cold
ions and hot, Maxwellian electrons. This model has proved to be suitable for a detailed analysis of the expansion
mechanism in a wide range of conditions, since the dynamics can be determined by the single dimensionless parameter
ˆT0 = ZkBT0/ǫCE = 3λ2
0 (λD being the initial Debye length for the electrons), which accounts for both the initial
electron temperature and the cluster parameters (size and density).

along its trajectory. Figure 11 shows the asymptotic ion spectrum for diﬀerent values of ˆT0. For ˆT0 < 0.5, profound
diﬀerences exist with respect to the CE case, with the distribution exhibiting a local maximum far from the cutoﬀ
energy. The spectrum is monotonic only for ˆT0 > 0.5 (a condition already close to the CE regime, with cutoﬀ energy
above 0.7ǫCE). Therefore, the transition value ˆT0 = 0.5 can be considered as the lower bound for the validity of the
CE approximation. The cutoﬀ energy ǫmax and the location of the maximum, ǫpeak, are plotted in Fig. 12 as functions

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The study presented here demonstrates the possibility of controlling the expansion of ﬁnite-size plasmas with
In fact, by irradiating a spherical target with sequential beams (double-pump
appropriately shaped laser pulses.
technique) the phase-space dynamics of the ions can be manipulated, driving large-scale shock shells. These peculiar
kinetic structures can lead to highly energetic ion-ion collisions and intracluster nuclear fusion reactions (in the case
of clusters composed of deuterium or mixtures of deuterium and tritium). The features of the shock shells can be
tailored by varying the intensity of the two laser pulses and the time delay between them, thus providing an eﬃcient
way to control the explosion of nanometer-sized plasmas. In the future, the availability of even more intense lasers
will allow the control of the expansion of micrometer-sized, solid spheres, thus opening the way toward ultraprompt,
ultralocalized sources of nuclear reactions, which can be useful for neutron production or nucleosynthesis.

Since expansion control is achieved by acting on the electron dynamics, a detailed knowledge of the self-consistent
dynamics of ions and electrons is required. The ergodic model described here provides a new, eﬃcient tool, capable of
describing the kinetics of spherical nanoplasma expansions with high accuracy. Although the ergodic model has been
employed here in the paradigmatic case of initially Maxwellian electrons, it can also be used with arbitrary initial
distributions of electron energy; this can be of interest in particular physical scenarios where accurate control over the
expansion is crucial, such as in single-shot X-ray imaging of biological samples, in order to guarantee that no relevant
sample damage takes place before the typical imaging time.

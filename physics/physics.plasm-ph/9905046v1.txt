Abstract

The excitation of wake waves by a relativistic homogeneous elec-
tron bunch passing through cold magnetized plasma at equilibrium is
studied for arbitrary values of the ratio of bunch density to plasma
density. The analysis is based on the assumption that the magnetic
ωp, where ωp and ωB are the elec-
ﬁeld is suﬃciently strong (ωB ≫
tron plasma and cyclotron frequences respectively). The periodic and
nonperiodic solutions for the momentum of plasma electrons inside
and outside the bunch are analyzed. It was shown that the presence
of strong external magnetic ﬁeld may increase the amplitude of wake
waves and the maximum transformer ratio, the latter being reached
at densities of bunch lower than that in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld.
The optimum conditions for obtaining the maximum values of the
wake ﬁeld amplitude and of the transformer ratio are found.

1 INTRODUCTION

The plasma wake-ﬁeld accelerator (PWFA), proposed by Chen, Dawson, Huﬀ,
and Katsouleas1 in 1985, and discussed in a slightly diﬀerent context by Fainberg2
as early as 1956, uses electrostatic ﬁelds in a plasma wave driven by a relativistic
electron beam. Charged particles can then be accelerated in this electrostatic
wake to ultrahigh energies. The ﬁrst experimental observation, at the Argonne
National Laboratory Advanced Accelerator Test Facility, of acceleration by the
PWFA mechanism has been reported in Ref.3 The one-dimensional theory of the
nonlinear regime of the PWFA developed by Rosenzweig4
6, Ruth et al.7, Am-
−
atuni et al.8,9 and Khachatryan10 predict certain advantages over the linear regime
(for more details see reviews11,12). It has been shown that the transformer ratio,
the ratio of the maximum decelerating ﬁeld inside the driving electron bunch
to the maximum accelerating ﬁeld found in the wake of the driver, is enhanced
by driving the plasma waves with an ultrarelativistic electron bunch of density
one-half that of the plasma electrons. This interesting method of obtaining large
transformer ratios is asserted to be more straightforward than alternatives in the
linear regime, and also to lessen the multiple scattering that the accelerating par-
ticles undergo in a PWFA, as the plasma used need not be as dense as the linear
regime requires. The simplicity of the nonlinear scheme for obtaining high trans-
former ratios, as well as the inherently high accelerating gradients, also makes
this method interesting as a candidate for high-energy cosmic-ray-acceleration
mechanism.

The high transformer ratios obtained in this nonlinear scheme depend on
driving the plasma electron density waves to extremely large amplitudes.
In
contrast to the linear waves, the maximum energy the electrons reach during
the oscillation is many times their rest mass energy. The electron oscillation
period is an increasing function of this maximum energy. As the amplitude of
the wave grows, the wave steepens dramatically, and the positive excursion in
density becomes very large in amplitude and narrow in time.

An important result of the nonlinear theory is the proof that the wave breaking

The excitation of nonlinear one-dimensional wake waves in underdense and

overdense plasma by a relativistic electron bunch was studied in Ref.9

2

In the present work an analogous problem has been treated in the presence of
strong external magnetic ﬁeld B0. A qualitatively novel eﬀect of dependence of
the amplitude of wake wave excited by an one-dimensional bunch on the angle α
of magnetic ﬁeld orientation with respect to the direction of bunch motion was
found. When α is increased from zero to ∆ = arcsin(1/γb), then wake waves
with larger amplitudes as well as larger transformer ratios are obtained. Here,
the maximum value of the transformer ratio is attained at lower densities of the
bunch in comparison with the case of B0 = 0.

2 BASIC EQUATIONS

Our treatment will start with equations of cold relativistic nonlinear ﬂuid theory.
We assume that the plasma ions form an immobile neutralizing background of
density n0 and deﬁne the plasma electron density n, velocity v = βc, and the
plasma frequency ωp = (4πn0e2/m)1/2. We now write the ﬂuid equations for
plasma electrons in the presence of an ultrarelativistic beam with homogeneous
density nb, length d, moving with the velocity ub = βbc along the z axis and
external constant magnetic ﬁeld B0 (B0x = B0 sin α, B0y = 0, B0z = B0 cos α,
where α is the angle between B0 and ub):

induced magnetic ﬁeld are determined by means of relations: Ex = βbBy, Ey =

in the absence of external magnetic ﬁeld (B0 = 0) and Eqs.(8) and (11) pass
into the well known equations derived in Refs.[9] and [15]. So, in an anisotropic
magnetized plasma, besides the longitudinal motion, the one-dimensional bunch
excites the motion of plasma electrons in the direction normal to that of bunch
travel. When α = 0 (the magnetic ﬁeld is directed along ub) the magnetic ﬁeld
has no inﬂuence on the excitation of wake waves and we arrive at the known
equations of motion that describe only the longitudinal motion of electrons.

To investigate the set of Eqs. (6)-(11) it is convenient to exclude the elec-

To express the components of electric ﬁeld Ex and Ez through the dimen-

Note that from the continuity of components of the ﬁeld and momentum of
electrons on the boundaries of the bunch there follows the continuity of function
Φ(ξ) at ξ = 0 and ξ = d.

Thus, Eqs.(15) and (18)-(22) determine the wake wave in the magnetized
plasma for large value of the external magnetic ﬁeld. For α = 0 we obtain from
Eqs. (18)-(22) that Ex = By = 0, and Eqs. (15), (18) and (20) coincide with
equations given in Refs.
[9, 15], that describe longitudinal oscillations of the
plasma electrons. When α has values diﬀerent from zero, the nature of solutions
of Eqs. (15) and (18)-(22) is drastically changed. First, as we shall see below, the
behavior of solution of Eq. (15) depends on the fact whether the angle α is greater
or less than a deﬁnite value ∆ = arcsin(1/γb). Second, owing to an anisotropy of
plasma due to the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld, besides the longitudinal
components there arise transverse components (as well as an induced magnetic
ﬁeld). Furthermore, owing to the anisotropy of plasma the components of the
wake ﬁeld (Eqs. (18)-(22)) contain the Coulomb ﬁeld of the bunch (the second
terms in Eqs. (18)-(22)) that depends along with other parameters also on the
angle α.

Below we shall analyze the Eq. (15) inside and behind the bunch; inside, on

and outside the anisotropy cone α = ∆.

TIO nB/n0

Now let us consider the equation of plasma motion (15) inside the bunch. In this
range 0

for boundary conditions ρ(d) = Φ(d) = 0 will give

In Eq. (23) one is to take the sign plus (minus) when ρ(ξ) decreases (increases)
with increasing ξ. As it follows from the Eq. (23), for solution of Eq. (15) it
is necessary that the radicand in (23) assume only the positive values. Hence
follows a restriction on the momentum of plasma electrons: ρ
0. Taking into
account this restriction one is to take the sign ”minus” during the integration of
Eq. (23). Making allowance for boundary conditions at the front boundary of
the bunch we obtain from (22) and (23)

To proceed with an analysis of the expression (25) one has to know whether

α is greater or less than ∆ and the dependence of α on the density of bunch.
First consider the case when α is inside the anisotropy cone (α < ∆).

As it follows from Eq. (37) for arbitrary densities of the bunch the momentum
of electrons increases monotonically with the distance from the front boundary
of the bunch.

(cid:17)

3.3 Outside the Cone: α > ∆

At large values of angle α (α > ∆) the value of A is always negative. As follows
from an analysis of Eq. (23), in such a case ρ is a monotonic function of ξ and is
described by Eqs. (31)-(35) for diﬀerent values of the bunch density. So, when the
conditions nb/n0 < b2, nb/n0 = b2 and nb/n0 > b2 are approached, the implicit
dependences of ρ on ξ are given by Eqs. (34), (33) and (31) respectively.

4 THE FIELDS INSIDE THE BUNCH FOR
ARBITRARY VALUES OF THE RATIO nb/n0

In this Section the Eqs. (18) and (19) describing the induced electromagnetic
ﬁelds inside the bunch were analyzed. Consider at ﬁrst the case α
= ∆. We
shall begin with an analysis of a transverse component of electric ﬁeld Ex. In the
previous Section it was shown that the momentum of electrons inside the bunch
meets the condition ρ(ξ)
0. As follows from this inequality, Eq. (7) and the
boundary condition Ex(d) = 0, inside the bunch Ex is positive and monotonically
increases with distance from the front boundary of the bunch. The function Ex
(as well as By) takes on the maximum value at the rear boundary of the bunch,
at ξ = 0. From Eq. (18) one obtains for the maximum value of Ex:

The case cos α = βb (or γb sin α = 1) is to be considered separately, as in this
case the Eq. (18), (19) make no sense. Indeed, it follows from expressions (22)
and (36) that both the denominator and the determinant of the expressions (18)
and (19) tend to zero when α
∆. The electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the bunch
in this case may be found from Eqs. (7), (8) (or Eqs. (7) and (17)) and (37).

To ﬁnd the wake ﬁeld Ex(ξ) and Ez(ξ) behind the bunch (ξ
0), one has to
integrate Eq. (15) for nb = 0 taking into account the condition of continuity of
ﬁelds and momentum ρ at the rear boundary of the bunch ξ = 0. In this case
the ﬁelds are determined by means of expressions (20)-(22), where now

It is seen from obtained expressions that

. Thus,
the maximum values of transverse and longitudinal ﬁelds behind the bunch are
respectively. Here the value of transverse ﬁeld varies with respect to
E2x and
some positive quantity (the ﬁrst term in Eq. (54)), and the value of longitudinal
ﬁeld varies with respect to some negative quantity (the ﬁrst term in Eq. (55)).

Now consider the eﬃciency of wake ﬁeld excitation for diﬀerent values of
the density and thickness of the bunch. If the momentum of plasma electrons
inside the bunch is a periodic function (the bunch density meets the condition
of subsection A1 of Section III, nb/n0 < b1), then inside the bunch the variation
range of ρ is deﬁned by the relation
0, where ρ0 is determined
ρ0 ≤
−
by expression (26). In case when an integer number of wavelengths is interposed
within the bunch (d = (n+1)λin, where n = 0, 1, 2 ...), then it follows from results
of subsection A1 of the Section III that ρ(0) = 0, and in virtue of expression (51)
ρmax = 0. In this case (as in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld [9]) the momentum
of electrons for ξ
0 is zero, and the density of plasma is coincident with the
equilibrium value n0. As follows from expressions (20), (21), and (50) and (51),
the components of electric ﬁelds for ξ
0 are constant and are determined by
≤
the second terms of expressions (20) and (21). Thus, when the condition of
d = (n + 1)λin is observed in an anisotropic plasma, a constant electric ﬁeld
may arise behind the bunch that is perpendicular to the external magnetic ﬁeld
according to expressions (54) and (55).

6 THE TRANSFORMER RATIO

In this Section we shall consider the transformer ratio R that is deﬁned as the
ratio of maximum value of longitudinal wake ﬁeld to that of decelerating ﬁeld
inside the bunch R = E(out)
z max [4-9]. Since the periodic wake ﬁeld is excited
only in case of α < ∆, below we shall consider the transformer ratio precisely for
these values of angle α.

z max/E(in)

We would brieﬂy remind the results obtained for R in the absence of magnetic
ﬁeld. As follows from the results of Refs. [4-9], the transformer ratio monoton-
2 (γb −
ically increases with density of bunch, the maximum value Rmax ≃
1)
1/(2 + 1/γb). In the linear case (nb/n0 ≪
being achieved at nb/n0 ≃
1) the func-
p
tion R assumes the value R = 2. When nb/n0 > 1/(2 + 1/γb), the transformer
ratio is monotonically decreasing and tends to unity, R
1, at very large values of
bunch density. So, in this case for excitation of wake waves the optimal is a bunch
with length d
1/(1 + βb),
λin/2 and density 1/(2 + 1/γb)
for which the amplitude of wake waves and the transformer ratio take maximum
values.

As was mentioned above, at nb/n0 > b0 the thickness of the bunch is restricted

ﬁeld at the ﬁrst boundary (when ξ = 0) and is determined by expression (42).
In the range of nb/n0 > b0 as a whole, the maximum value of longitudinal wake

As follows from expressions (77), (78) and (80), in the presence of external
strong magnetic ﬁeld in plasma, the transformer ratio increases and for α . ∆
much exceeds the value of R at B0 = 0.

In Figs. 8-10 the dependence of R on the density of bunch (nb/n0) (Figs. 8, 9)
and on the angle α (Fig. 10) is shown for γb = 60. In Fig. 8 the dotted, dashed
and solid lines correspond to the following values of the angle α respectively:
α = 0, α = 0.2∆ and α = 0.4∆.
In Fig. 9 the dotted and solid lines have
been plotted for α = 0.6∆ and α = 0.8∆ respectively. In Fig. 10 the solid line
corresponds to nb/n0 = 0.7, the dashed and dotted lines respectively to nb/n0 = 1
and to nb/n0 = 1.3.

One can assure that the dotted line in Fig. 8, for which α = 0, coincides with
an analogous result obtained in Ref. [9] in the absence of external magnetic ﬁeld.
Thus, it follows from the above analysis and from Figs. 8-10 that the presence
of strong external magnetic ﬁeld increases the amplitude of wake waves excited
by the one-dimensional bunch as well as the transformer ratio. This eﬀect is
most strongly manifested in the case when the angle of magnetic ﬁeld orientation
is close to ∆ (α . ∆). Note also that the transformer ratio is maximum at
b0, and with increasing α the position of this value is shifted to lower
nb/n0 ≃
densities of the bunch. Hence, in the presence of strong magnetic ﬁeld the larger
values of transformer ratio may be obtained at much lower densities of the bunch
than in the case of B0 = 0.

7 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion we shall give a brief summary of the results and discuss possible
restrictions on the validity of conclusions.

≥

The behavior of one-dimensional electromagnetic waves excited in plasma in
the presence of external strong magnetic ﬁeld, strongly depends on the orientation
of bunch motion with respect to the direction of magnetic ﬁeld. At large values of
angle α (α
∆ = arcsin(1/γb)) the density and momentum of plasma electrons
, as well as the excited electromagnetic ﬁelds vary in the space monotonically.
Here the electromagnetic ﬁeld increases linearly with the distance from the bunch.
Obviously, this result is valid only in the one-dimensional model and in case of an
allowance for the transverse size of the bunch (i.e., in the three-dimensional case)
the ﬁelds will tend to zero at large distances. In Ref. [16] an excitation of three-
dimensional linear wake waves was considered in the magnetized plasma. It was
shown here that at large distances from the driving bunch the ﬁelds nevertheless
tend to zero although slowly (by the power-law dependence). So, the linear
increase of one-dimensional wake ﬁelds behind the bunch is limited by the distance
that is proportional to the cross-size of the bunch.

The allowance for the transverse size of the bunch results also in the following
a2, where a is the transverse
a2 and r2

additional restrictions [17]: γ2
size of the bunch and r is the transverse coordinate.

ρ ≪

b λ2

≪

At small values of the angle α (α < ∆) a periodic wake ﬁelds is excited
behind the bunch, the amplitude of which increases when α
∆. In this case
the transformer ratio also increases, the position of its maximum being displaced
to lower densities of the bunch.

→

It follows from the aforesaid that optimal conditions for the excitation of wake
b0(α), where b0(α) is determined by expression

waves are d . λin/2 and nb/n0 ≃
(60).

Another feature due to the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld is the excitation
of transverse electric and magnetic ﬁelds, that are absent in the one-dimensional
case at B0 = 0 [4-10].

The allowance for thermal motion of plasma electrons leads to inessential
corrections to wake wave characteristics at temperatures practically achievable
under laboratory conditions [18].

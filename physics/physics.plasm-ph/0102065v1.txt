The spectrum of

ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
pressure-driven (ballooning) modes in strongly nonaxisym-
metric toroidal systems is diﬃcult to analyze numerically ow-
ing to the singular nature of ideal MHD caused by lack of
an inherent scale length. In this paper, ideal MHD is regu-
larized by using a k-space cutoﬀ, making the ray tracing for
the WKB ballooning formalism a chaotic Hamiltonian bil-
liard problem. The minimum width of the toroidal Fourier
spectrum needed for resolving toroidally localized ballooning
modes with a global eigenvalue code is estimated from the
Weyl formula. This phase-space-volume estimation method
is applied to two stellarator cases.

In design studies for new magnetic conﬁnement devices
for fusion plasma experiments (e.g.
investigations [1,2]
leading to the proposed National Compact Stellarator
Experiment, NCSX [3]), the maximum pressure that can
stably be conﬁned in any proposed magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration is routinely estimated by treating the plasma
as an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ﬂuid. One
linearizes about a sequence of equilibrium states with in-
creasing pressure, and studies the spectrum of normal
modes (frequency ω) to determine when there is a com-
ponent with Im ω > 0, signifying instability.

Even with the simpliﬁcation obtained by using the
ideal MHD model, the computational task of determining
the theoretical stability of a three-dimensional (i.e. non-
axisymmetric) device, such as NCSX or the four currently
operating helical axis stellators [4], remains a challenging
one.

The problem can be posed as a Lagrangian ﬁeld the-
ory, with the potential term being the energy functional
δW [5]. For a static equilibrium, the kinetic energy is
quadratic in ω, so that ω2 is real. Thus instability oc-
curs when ω2 < 0. There are two main approaches to
analyzing the spectrum—local and global.

In the local approach, which is used for analytical sim-
pliﬁcation, one orders the scale length of variation of the
eigenfunction across the magnetic ﬁeld lines to be short
compared with equilibrium scale lengths [6]. Both inter-
change and ballooning stability can be treated by solving
the general ballooning equations [7], a system of ordinary
diﬀerential equations deﬁned on a given magnetic ﬁeld
line.

The global

(Galerkin) approach is to expand the
plasma displacement ﬁeld in a ﬁnite basis set, inserting
this ansatz in the Lagrangian to ﬁnd a matrix eigen-
value representation of the spectral problem. This ap-
proach has been implemented for ideal MHD in three-
dimensional plasmas in two codes, TERPSICHORE [8]
and CAS3D [9].

Although the Galerkin approach is potentially exact, if
one could use a complete, inﬁnite basis set, it is in prac-
tice computationally challenging due to the large number
of basis functions required to resolve localized instabili-
ties. This leads to very large matrices which must be
diagonalized by iterative methods. There is a need for
analytical insight to determine a suitable truncated ba-
sis set and to predict the nature of the spectrum, e.g.
whether it is continuous or discrete.

Such insight may be obtained by a hybrid local-
global approach, in which one uses a Wentzel–Kramers–
Brillouin (WKB) representation of the eigenfunction. In
the short-wavelength limit, the same analytical simpliﬁ-
cations as are obtained in the local approach are found to
give a local dispersion relation that can be used to give
information on the global spectrum by using ray tracing
and semiclassical quantization.

In axisymmetric systems [10] or in cases where helical
ripple can be averaged out, giving an adiabatic invariant,
[11,12], the ray equations are integrable and hence the
spectrum is characterized by “good quantum numbers”.
However, it has been known for many years [7] that the
ray-tracing problem in strongly three-dimensional sys-
tems is singular because, in the absence of an adiabatic
invariant, the phase-space motion is not bounded—the
rays escape to inﬁnity in the wavevector sector. Dewar
and Glasser [7] argued that this gives rise to a contin-
uous unstable spectrum, with correspondingly singular
generalized eigenfunctions. (A more rigorous treatment

involves the concept of the essential spectrum and Weyl
sequences [13,14].)

Our proposed regularization of this singularity can be
understood using a simple quantum analogy. Consider
the one-dimensional time-independent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion Hψ = Eψ in the limit as the mass of the par-
ticle goes to inﬁnity. Then the kinetic energy disap-
pears and the Hamiltonian becomes H = V (x), where
V is the potential energy, assumed here to be the har-
monic oscillator potential, 1
2 x2 in suitable units. In the
usual Hilbert space the energy spectrum is continuous:
E ≥ 0 and the (generalized) eigenfunctions singular:
ψ(x) = δ(x − xE) ± δ(x + xE), where V (xE) ≡ E.

We now seek a regularization of this problem by re-
stricting ψ to the space of functions with a ﬁnite band-
width in wavenumber k:

ψ(x) =

This truncated Fourier-integral representation models

This is inﬁnite unless we require the coeﬃcients of the
δ-functions to vanish. That is, ψk = 0 at k = ±kmax.
The Euler–Lagrange equation is (d2/2dk2 + E)ψk = 0,
which has the solutions exp ±i(2E)1/2k. These waves
would propagate to inﬁnity if it were not for the reﬂecting
boundary conditions at ±kmax we have just derived.

That is, we have removed the continuum by box quan-
tization in k-space. In the following we shall do the same
for the ballooning mode problem.

As in [7] we write the magnetic ﬁeld of an arbi-
trary three-dimensional toroidal equilibrium plasma with
nested magnetic ﬂux surfaces labeled by an arbitrary pa-
rameter s as B = ∇ζ×∇ψ − q∇θ×∇ψ ≡ ∇α×∇ψ,
where α ≡ ζ − qθ. Here, θ and ζ are the poloidal and
toroidal angles, respectively, ψ(s) is the poloidal ﬂux
function, and q(s) is the inverse of the rotational trans-
form. Since B·∇s = B·∇α = 0, s and α serve to label
an individual ﬁeld line.

We take the stream function [6] to be given by ϕ =
ϕ(θ|s, α) is assumed to vary on
ϕ exp(iS − iωt) , where
the equilibrium scale. The phase variation is taken to be

rapid, so k ≡ ∇S is ordered to be large. The frequency
ω is ordered O(1), which requires that the wave vector be
perpendicular to B: k·B ≡ 0. (In this study we consider
unstable ideal MHD modes, ω2 < 0.)

It immediately follows that the eikonal is constant on
each ﬁeld line: S = S(α, s). From the deﬁnition of the
wave vector, k = kα∇α + ks∇s ≡ kα[∇α + θkq′(s)∇s]
where kα ≡ ∂S/∂α and ks ≡ ∂S/∂s. Here the anglelike
ballooning parameter θk appears naturally as the ratio
ks/q′(s)kα [10].

The ballooning equation emerges in the large |k| ex-
pansion [7,6] as an ordinary diﬀerential equation to be
solved on each ﬁeld line (α, s) with given (kα, ks) under
the boundary condition
ϕ(θ) → 0 at inﬁnity to give the
eigenvalue λ(α, s, kα, ks). This constitutes a local disper-
sion relation λ ≡ ρω2 (the mass density ρ being assumed
constant everywhere).

b

The ray equations are the characteristics of the eikonal
equation λ(α, s, ∂αS, ∂sS) = ρω2. These are Hamiltonian
equations of motion with α, s the generalized coordinates,
kα, ks the canonically conjugate momenta, and λ as the
Hamiltonian.

In axi- or helically symmetric systems all ﬁeld lines on
a given magnetic surface are equivalent—α is ignorable
and kα is a constant of the motion. In this case the equa-
tions are integrable and semiclassical quantization can be
used to predict the approximate spectrum of global bal-
looning instabilities [10]. This technique can sometimes
be applied successfully, even in nonsymmetric systems, if
there are regions of phase space with a large measure of
invariant tori [15,11]. In [11] this was veriﬁed using the
global eigenvalue code TERPSICHORE [8].

At the other extreme, if the ray orbits are chaotic (but
still bounded) then the global spectrum is not regularly
structured, but must rather be described statistically by
the density of states and the probability distribution of
level spacings using the techniques of quantum chaos the-
ory (see e.g. [16,17]).

However, because of the scale invariance of the ideal
MHD equations, λ depends only on the direction of k,
not on its magnitude: λ = λ(α, s, θk). This has the
consequence that the ray orbits are unbounded in phase
space, so, strictly speaking, ideal MHD gives rise to a
quantum chaotic scattering [16,17] problem rather than
a straight quantum chaos problem. This leads to the con-
tinuous spectrum [7] with singular generalized eigenfunc-
tions that cannot really be represented using the simple
eikonal ansatz.

On the other hand, the absence of a natural length
scale in ideal MHD is a mathematical artifact. Phys-
ically, the ion Larmor radius provides a lower cutoﬀ in
space, or an upper cutoﬀ in |k|, beyond which ideal MHD
ceases to apply. The ballooning equation is also physi-
cally regularized by inclusion of diamagnetic drift [18,15].
However, since in general it leads to a complex ray
tracing problem [19], we shall not attempt to model dia-

magnetic drift stabilization in this paper. Rather, we
regularize the ray equations simply by adding a barrier
term to the eﬀective ray “Hamiltonian” H(α, s, kα, ks),

H = λ(α, s, kα, ks) + U (kα) ,

(4)

where the barrier potential we use is U (kα) ≡ K(|kα| −
kmax)2 for |kα| > kmax and 0 for |kα| < kmax. In the limit
of the constant K → ∞, this inﬁnite box potential gives
the ideal MHD ray equations for |kα| < kmax and reﬂect-
ing boundary conditions at |kα| = kmax. Thus we have a
two-degree of freedom Hamiltonian billiard problem.

Although overly crude for modeling FLR stabilization,
the cutoﬀ at |kα| = kmax provides a reasonable model for
representing the ﬁnite spectral bandwidth in the toroidal
Fourier mode number (n) representation used in the
global eigenvalue codes TERPSICHORE [8] and CAS3D
[9].

FIG. 1. The sections θk = 0 and q = 0.893 of the topo-
logically spherical isosurfaces of the central, (0,0), ballooning
mode branch, bounded by the isosurface λ = −6 (arbitrary
units). The darker shades denote higher growth rates, the
peak corresponding to λ ≈ −8.

Using ballooning-unstable plasma equilibria calculated
for the H-1NF heliac [20,4] using the VMEC code [21],
detailed parameter scans have been undertaken for two
cases. The ﬁrst case studied [22] was obtained by increas-
ing the pressure gradient of a marginally stable equilib-
rium [23] uniformly across the plasma and thus was bal-
looning unstable at the edge of the plasma. The ray
tracing problem for this case would involve consideration
of the eﬀect of the plasma boundary.

Thus a second equilibrium, ballooning stable near the
edge of the plasma, was calculated for the purposes of
the present paper. This case has a more peaked pressure
proﬁle than the ﬁrst, but both have average β ≈ 1%,
where β is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic ﬁeld
pressure.

The q-proﬁles are not monotonic—in the peaked pres-
sure proﬁle case studied in this paper, q was 0.8895 on
the magnetic axis, rising to a maximum value of 0.8964
quite close to the magnetic axis, then falling monoton-
ically to 0.8675. Clearly the (global) magnetic shear is
very weak. Despite this fact and the non-monotonicity,
there is some formal simpliﬁcation in choosing s ≡ q, and

we have taken s = q since the region of plasma studied
is in a monotonic-decreasing part of the q-proﬁle (the
decreasing region outside the maximum-q surface).

In these scans the most unstable ballooning eigen-
value was tabulated on a three-dimensional grid in s, α, θk
space. The dependence on α was found to be rapid. The
dependence on θk was much slower, but the variation was
suﬃcient that the higher-growth-rate isosurfaces formed
a set of distinct, topologically spherical branches. It was
argued in [22] that this branch structure is produced by
Anderson localization in bad curvature regions due to
the strong breaking of both helical and axisymmetry in
H-1NF.

According to the perturbation expansion in q′ de-
scribed in [22], a quadratic form in α, θk should form a
good approximation to λ − λmin(q) in the neighborhood
of the central branch. Accordingly a least-squares ﬁt on
each surface was performed to provide a simple analytical
description of the (0, 0) [22] branch.

The radial dependence of the ﬁtting coeﬃcients was
approximated by ﬁtting to third-degree polynomials in
q. Sections of the resulting approximation to the cen-
tral branch are shown in Fig. 1. The isosurface spans a
substantial range of magnetic surfaces within the plasma
— the narrow range of variation in q is due to the low
magnetic shear in H-1NF.

In order to establish the nature of the ray dynamics de-
scribed by the regularized Hamiltonian, Eq. (4), a numer-
ical integration with cutoﬀ at kmax = 50 was performed
with initial conditions q = q2, α = 0, and kα = 5, where
[q1, q2] = [0.8852, 0.8951] is the q-range spanned by the
λ = −6 isosurface as seen in Fig. 1. (A run with kα = 10
was also performed, with similar results.) Choosing the
value K = 1 gave a good compromise between the sharp
boundary potential to be modeled, and the smooth po-
tential required for the numerical integration. The orbit
remained on the “energy shell” λ = −6 to within an ac-
curacy of one part in 106 over the “time” interval of the
integration, 7500.

FIG. 2. Two views of intersections with the Poincar´e sur-

The two Poincar´e plots in Fig. 2 show the orbit to be
strongly chaotic, ﬁlling the “energy shell” ergodically, ex-
cept that the regions kα > 0 and kα < 0 are dynamically
disjoint. The solid curve shown surrounding the outer
limits of the “energetically accessible” region is calcu-
lated by solving λ(0, q, kq/kmax) = −6.

According to the Weyl formula [16, pp.

257–261],
the number, N (λmax), of global eigenmodes with eigen-
values below the eigenvalue λmax is given, asymp-
totically in the limit N → ∞, as N (λmax) ∼
v4D(λmax)/(2π)2. Here v4D(λmax) is the volume of the
dynamically acessible 4-dimensional phase-space region
λ(α, q, kq/kα) < λmax, 0 < kα < kmax. The kα integra-
tion can be performed analytically, giving v4D(λmax) =
1
2 k2
maxv3D(λmax), where v3D(λmax) is the volume within
the isosurface λ(α, q, θk) = λmax. Thus

N (λmax) ∼

maxv3D(λmax) .

8π2 k2

We can make a rather rough estimate of the minimum
value of nmax required for CAS3D or TERPSICHORE
to ﬁnd even one eigenvalue with λ < λmax by setting
N (λmax) = 1 and calculating kmax ≈ nmax from Eq. (5).
This gives nmax(N = 1) ∼ (8π2/v3D)1/2.

The isosurface λ = −6 studied above is about the
largest of the disjoint topologically spherical isosurfaces
corresponding to the highly toroidally localized strongly
ballooning unstable regions of α, q, θk space. (For λ > −6
the isosurfaces are no longer topologically spherical.) Us-
ing the polynomial ﬁts described above, we calculate
v3D(−6) = 0.02158. This gives nmax(N = 1) ≈ 60. As-
suming that the dominant contributions to the MHD en-
ergy δW come from the rational surfaces intersecting the
λ = −6 isosurface, we thus predict that it would be neces-
sary to include, as a minimum set, basis functions corre-
sponding to one of the two “mode families” [9] contained
in the set (n, m) = (9, 8), (18, 16), (19, 17), (27, 24),
(28, 25), (35, 31), (36, 32), (37, 33), (38, 34), (44, 39),
(45, 40), (46, 41), (47, 42), (53, 47), (54, 48), (55, 49, ),
(56, 50), and (57, 51) to resolve a toroidally localized bal-
looning mode. (Here n, m are the toroidal and poloidal
Fourier mode numbers, respectively.)

The large value of nmax(N = 1) required, and the un-
usual spread in n required in the basis set, will make
these modes diﬃcult to resolve using global eigenvalue
codes (e.g. the simplifying phase factor method some-
times used in CAS3D studies [1] would not be appropri-
ate). It is hoped that the Weyl formula estimate above
will act as a guide in a future more extensive study us-
ing such a code. Physically, the large value of nmax sug-
gests that toroidally localized ballooning modes in H-1NF
should be subject to strong FLR stabilization.

We can also apply the same approach to the toroidally
localized ballooning branches found in the Large Heli-
cal Device (LHD) study [12]. From the plots in [12] we
estimate v3D ∼ 0.05, which gives nmax(N = 1) ≈ 40.

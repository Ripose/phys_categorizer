It is shown that the Poisson equation for the electric ﬁeld in a plasma, yields to a Burgers type equation which
may be solved analyticaly for a constant source term. The solution of the obtained equation shows the well-
known elastic property of the electric force.

Abstract

Let us consider a plasma undergoing a constant applied electric ﬁeld Ea, and composed of electrons

and motionless ions. This allows to write the one dimensional Poisson equation as

∂xE =

n,

where n

ne is the electronic density, and the electronic current density as

≡

with µ standing for the (constant) electronic mobility,
diffusion coefﬁcient. Then, we use the conservation equation for the electronic current density :

where S is a source term supposed constant. From this, combining relations (1), (2) and (3) in order
to cancel the density, we get successively

that is to say that we have to solve the following one dimensional Burgers equation with an elastic
forcing term

with

as initial condition if initially there are no charges separation.

We have shown ref.[1] the possibility to solve analyticaly such an equation. So, taking notation
of this reference, we can solve the equation (10), for example by the way of the “space and time
transformation” method with c(¯t) = 0. We have thus to solve the following equation

where ¯S is constant, and with the initial condition

∂¯tE + E∂¯xE = ¯D∂¯x¯xE

The variables to be determined in ref.[1] are a1, r(¯t), q(¯t). They obey respectively the relations

(12 ref.[1]), (13 ref.[1]) and (11b ref.[1]). We get so

a1 = i

which is a stationary solution. Moreover, from this relation, we can deduce that the force acting on
an electron is related to an elastic forcing term. We have actually

where the string constant κ is given by

Notice that an electron undergoing the single force (25) (low viscosity), will oscillate with a pulsation
ω such as

me standing for the electronic mass.
We have to underline the fact that the resolution presented here is valid only because the source term
is constant. For a source term equal to zero, an homogeneous Burgers equation appears and from
which the solution goes to zero for the asymptotic limit. Hence, the source term may give rise to an
elastic forcing term, and thus generated oscillations in the plasma. Moreover, we can notice that the
asymptotic limit is independant of the initial condition

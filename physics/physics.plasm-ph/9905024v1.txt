The short-time dynamics of correlated systems is strongly inﬂuenced by initial correlations giving
rise to an additional collision integral in the non-Markovian kinetic equation. Exact cancellation of
the two integrals is found if the initial state is thermal equilibrium which is an important consistency
criterion. Analytical results are given for the time evolution of the correlation energy which are
conﬁrmed by comparisons with molecular dynamics simulations (MD).

Although the Boltzmann kinetic equation is success-
fully applied to many problems in transport theory, it
has some serious shortcomings [1]. Among these, the
Boltzmann equation cannot be used on short time scales,
where memory eﬀects are important [2,3]. In such situa-
tions, a frequently used non-Markovian kinetic equation
is the so-called Levinson equation [4,5]. One remarkable
feature of this equation is that it describes the formation
of correlations in good agreement with molecular dynam-
ics simulations [6]. Nevertheless, the Levinson equation is
incomplete by two reasons: (i) It does not include corre-
lated initial states. (ii) When the evolution of the system
starts from the equilibrium state, the collision integral
does not vanish, but gives rise to spurious time evolution.
The latter point has been addressed by Lee et al. [7] who
clearly show that from initial correlations there must ap-
pear terms in the kinetic equation which ensure that the
collision integral vanishes in thermal equilibrium.

The aim of this letter is to derive the contributions
from initial correlations to the non-Markovian Levinson
equation within perturbation theory. We will restrict
ourselves to the Born approximation which allows us to
present the most straightforward derivation. The inclu-
sion of higher order correlations can be found in [3,8–10].
The eﬀect of initial correlations becomes particularly
transparent from our analytical results which may also
serve as a bench-mark for numerical simulations.

The outline of this Letter is as follows. First we give
the general scheme of inclusion of initial correlations into
the Kadanoﬀ and Baym equations in terms of the density
ﬂuctuation function. We show that initial correlations
enter the kinetic equation as self-energy corrections and
meanﬁeld-like contributions in terms of the initial two-
particle correlation function. An analytical expression
for the time dependent correlation energy of a high tem-
perature plasma is presented and then compared with
molecular dynamics simulations.

To describe density ﬂuctuations we start with the

causal density–density correlation function [11]

tion within the T-matrix approximation can be found in
[2,10] and of general initial conditions in [13]. The second
part (15) following from
gives just the correction to the
Levinson equation, which will guarantee the cancellation
of the collision integral for an equilibrium initial state.
Recently the analogous term in the collision integral has
been derived by other means [9].

To show the interplay between collisions and correla-
tions, we have calculated the initial two-particle correla-
tion function in the ensemble, where the dynamical inter-
action V (q) is replaced by some arbitrary function V0(q).
Therefore the initial state deviates from thermal equilib-
rium except when V (q) = V0(q) and ̺(t0) = ̺0.

The additional collision term,

I0, cancels exactly the
Levinson collision term in the case that we have initially
the same interaction as during the dynamical evolution
(V0 = V ) and if the system starts from the equilibrium
ρ(t)
ρ0. Therefore we have completed our task and
derived a correction of the Levinson equation which en-
sures the cancellation of the collision integral in thermal
equilibrium [15].

On very short time scales we can neglect the change in

obtain analytical results. We choose as a model interac-

In Fig. 2, upper panel, we compare the analytical re-

netic energy is shown for three diﬀerent ratios x. The
agreement between theory and simulations is quite satis-
factory, in particular, the short time behavior for x = 2.
The stronger initial increase of kinetic energy observed
in the simulations at x = 1 may be due to the ﬁnite size
of the simulation box which could more and more aﬀect
the results for increasing range of the interaction.

which containes κ0 instead of κD. Besides the kinetic en-
ergy (28) from initial correlations, the total energy Etotal
(26) now includes the initial correlation energy which can
be calculated from the long time limit of (27) leading to

The result (26) is seen in Fig. 2, lower panel. We ob-
serve that if the initial correlation is characterized by a
potential range larger than the Debye screening length,
x0 < 1, the initial state is over–correlated, and the cor-
relation energy starts at a higher absolute value than
without initial correlations relaxing towards the correct
equilibrium value. If, instead, x0 = 1 no change of cor-
relation energy is observed, as expected. Similar trends
have been observed in numerical solutions [9].

In summary, in this Letter initial correlations are inves-
tigated within kinetic theory. Explicit correction terms
appear on every level of perturbation theory correcting
the non-Markovian kinetic equation properly in a way
that the collision integral vanishes if the evolution starts
from a correlated equilibrium state. Furthermore, the

4

conservation laws of a correlated plasma are proven in-
cluding the contributions from initial correlations. It is
shown that besides the appearance of correlation energy
a correlated ﬂux appears if higher than Born correlations
are considered.

Deriving analytical formulas for high temperature plas-
mas allowed us to investigate the time dependent forma-
tion of the correlation energy and the decay of initial
correlations. The comparison with molecular dynamics
simulations is found to be satisfactorily. Including ini-
tial correlations the cases of over- and under-correlated
initial states are discussed. While starting from equilib-
rium the correlation energy does not change, for over-
and under-correlated states the equilibrium value is ap-
proached after a time of the order of the inverse plasma
frequency.

[15] It is interesting to note that the corrections to the next

the type found in impurity scattering. Therefore the ini-
tial correlations higher than ∼ V 2 are governed by an-
other type of dynamics than the build up of correlations
involved in I and I0.

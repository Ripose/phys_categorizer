The transport of collisional particles in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds is studied using the decorrelation
trajectory method. The nonlinear eﬀect of stochastic generation of magnetic island by magnetic
line trapping is considered together with particle collisions. The running diﬀusion coeﬃcient is
determined for arbitrary values of the statistical parameters of the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld and of
the collisional velocity. The eﬀect of the stochastic magnetic islands is analysed. PACS numbers:

I. INTRODUCTION

The problem of test particle diﬀusion in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds was studied by many authors [1]- [13] and im-
portant progress was obtained. However, the general solution was not yet found. Particle trajectories in a magnetized
plasma are determined by three stochastic processes: the magnetic ﬁeld, the collisional velocity along magnetic lines
and the collisional velocity perpendicular to the magnetic lines. These components of the stochastic collisional ve-
locities have very diﬀerent eﬀects. There are two important diﬃculties appearing in this triple stochastic process.
One is related to the parallel collisional velocity which enters as a multiplicative noise in the equations of motion and
the other with the Lagrangian non-linearity which is determined by the space dependence of the stochastic magnetic
ﬁeld. Each of these two problems has been recently studied but only considered separately. The complete model for
particle transport in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds could not be analyzed until now.

The latter diﬃculty can be eliminated if one restricts the study to stochastic magnetic ﬁelds with small amplitudes
and/or large perpendicular correlation lengths for which the magnetic Kubo number (deﬁned below) is small. If the
perpendicular collisional velocity is neglected, this quasilinear problem has an exact solution that was obtained by

t−1/2. It was shown
conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld with the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(t) decaying to zero as D(t)
[13] that this subdiﬀusive transport is due to collision induced trajectory trapping along the magnetic lines. The
parallel collisional velocity forces the particles to return in the already visited positions along the magnetic lines
and consequently generates long time Lagrangian correlation of the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld. If the perpendicular
collisional velocity is taken into account, the transport is diﬀusive and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient was evaluated semi-
qualitatively by several methods [1]- [11].

∼

On the other hand, the Lagrangian non-linearity determined by the space-dependence of the stochastic magnetic
ﬁeld leads, at large magnetic Kubo numbers, to magnetic line trapping and generation of stochastic magnetic islands.
B drift motion in an electrostatic
This process is mathematically identical with the trajectory trapping in the E
turbulence. The latter was recently studied by means of a new statistical approach, the decorrelation trajectory
method [15], [16].

×

The aim of this paper is to study the general problem of collisional particle diﬀusion in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds in
the guiding center approximation. More speciﬁcally, we determine the eﬀect of self-consistent generation of stochastic
magnetic islands on the eﬀective transport. The running diﬀusion coeﬃcient is determined for arbitrary parameters
of the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld and of particle collisions. The decorrelation trajectory method is used for studying
this rather complicated triple stochastic process.

The paper is organized as follows. The physical model is described in Section 2. We derive in Section 3 the
Lagrangian velocity correlation and the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient for arbitrary values of the four speciﬁc parameters
and for given Eulerian correlation of the potential. The physical signiﬁcance of this general result is then analyzed:

the subdiﬀusive transport in Section 4, the eﬀect of collisional cross-ﬁeld diﬀusion in Section 5 and the eﬀect of a time
variation of the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld in Section 6. The conclusions are summarized in Section 7.

II. THE SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS

The particle guiding center motion is studied in a magnetic ﬁeld with a stochastic component. The magnetic ﬁeld is
taken to be a sum of a large constant ﬁeld B0=B0ez and a small ﬂuctuating ﬁeld perpendicular to B0, and depending
on the perpendicular coordinates x
(x, y) and on the parallel coordinate z

≡

B = B0 (ez + b(x, z, t))

(Here the perpendicular and the parallel directions are deﬁned in relation to the direction of B0). This is the usual
slab model of the conﬁning conﬁguration in a tokamak plasma. Since the reduced magnetic ﬁeld is divergence-free,

b = 0, its two components can be determined from a scalar function φ(x, z) as

∇ ·

The system of equations for guiding center motion is:

b(x, z, t) =

φ(x, z, t)ez.

= ηk(t).

The three stochastic functions b(x, z, t), η⊥(t) and ηk(t) are statistically independent: all cross correlations are zero.
All these stochastic functions are assumed to be Gaussian, stationary and homogeneous, with zero averages. The
autocorrelation function of the stochastic potential φ(x, z, t) is modeled by:

III. SOLUTION BY THE DECORRELATION TRAJECTORY METHOD

We use the decorrelation trajectory method following the recent calculations for the inﬂuence of particle collisions
on the diﬀusion in electrostatic turbulence [16]. The diﬀerence and the supplementary diﬃculty of the magnetic
problem comes from the structure (15) of the velocity v which is the product of two stochastic processes. They are
statistically independent but in the Lagrangian frame they are correlated through the trajectories due to the space
dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. The later makes this problem strongly nonlinear. The trajectories also
depend on the collisional velocity η⊥ and thus the velocity v is a triple stochastic process in the Lagrangian frame.

We determine the collisional contributions to the perpendicular displacement:

Here v [x′(t) + ξ(t), z, t] = b [x′(t) + ξ(t), z, t] ηk(t) is a triple stochastic process.

We calculate ﬁrst the Eulerian correlation (EC) of b [x + ξ(t), z, t] which is deﬁned as an average over the magnetic

ﬁeld ﬂuctuations and over the perpendicular collisional velocity. We calculate the EC of the potential
φ [x + ζ(t), z, t] and then derive the EC of the magnetic ﬁeld components.

Thus the average eﬀect of the perpendicular collisional velocity η⊥(t) consists of the modiﬁcation of the EC of
the magnetic potential φ. The EC A(x, z, τ ) is transformed into E(x, z, τ ) [Eq.(21)] gaining a supplementary time-
dependence in addition to the one determined by the ﬁnite correlation time of the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld. As observed
in [16], E is the solution of a diﬀusive equation and the eﬀect of collisions consists in progressively smoothing out
the EC of the magnetic potential and in eliminating asymptotically the x dependence of E(x, z, τ ). Since the integral
over x of E is constant, the time dependence introduced by collisions in Eq.(21) does not destroy the correlation but
only spreads it out.

We note that the average over the collisional parallel velocity was not performed at this stage: z is in Eq. (21) an

the analytical results concerning the subdiﬀusive transport. Namely, as shown in the next section, the asymptotic

IV. SUBDIFFUSIVE TRANSPORT

We ﬁrst consider a static stochastic magnetic ﬁeld (τc → ∞

) and the zero Larmor radius limit corresponding to
negligible cross ﬁeld collisional diﬀusion, χ⊥ = 0. It is interesting to study separately this particular case because it
leads to a subdiﬀusive transport determined, as shown below, by two kinds of trapping processes. Moreover, the time
dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient obtained for these particular conditions allows the understanding of the scaling
lows of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient determined by the presence of a decorrelation mechanism.

For the limit λ⊥ → ∞

, an exact analytical solution was determined [14]. It was shown that particle perpendicular
transport is subdiﬀusive with the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient going asymptotically to zero as t−1/2. This particular
case is used here as a test for the decorrelation trajectory method. We show that the exact solution is found. Then
the non-linear problem corresponding to ﬁnite λ⊥ is studied. We show that the generation of magnetic islands by
magnetic line trapping does not change the asymptotic behavior of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient: a similar subdiﬀusive
t−1/2. The nonlinear process of island generation has a strong eﬀect but it is localized
regime is obtained with D(t)
∼
in time: it determines a transient decrease of D(t). This eﬀect is very important because it leads, as will be shown
in the next sections, to complex anomalous regimes when χ⊥ 6
disappears and the problem simpliﬁes considerably. The equations for the decorrelation trajectories (54) reduce to

Lagrangian correlation (and the maximum of D0) appears at the average returning time τr. It is determined from the
. It is remarkable
equation L0(τr; M, χk, 0,
to note that in the limiting case of absence of collisions (ν = 0), Eq.(62) yields a ﬁnite diﬀusion coeﬃcient. In this
case, χkν = V 2
T /2 (where VT is the thermal velocity) and a small time expansion can be done in Eq.(62) obtaining
the result of Jokipii and Parker [3], DJP = β2λkVT /√2. This is also well known as the Rochester and Rosenbluth
collisionless diﬀusion coeﬃcient [1], in the form DRR = DmVT , where Dm is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the magnetic
lines (see also [10], [11]). Thus, the collisions determine a very strong change of the perpendicular transport, which
is diﬀusive in the absence of collisions and becomes subdiﬀusive due to the parallel collisional motion. A physical
interpretation of this subdiﬀusive behavior is presented in [13] in terms of a parallel trapping process determined by
the collisions which force the particles to return in the already visited points along the magnetic lines. Consequently
the Lagrangian velocities remain correlated. Since the parallel velocity changes its direction due to collisions, this
long-time correlation is negative and thus determines the decay of the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient D0(t).

k

A similar subdiﬀusive transport appears in the non-linear case too, provided that χ⊥ = 0. In this case, n⊥(t) = 1

and the Hamiltonian (50) depends on time only through the factor fk(t). It can be written as:

and consequently one can make a change of variable from t to τ (t) deﬁned by

H(X, Y, t) = f⊥(X, Y ) fk(t),

The function τ (t) has a maximum and then decays to zero. The solution of the time-independent Hamiltonian
equations (65) is a periodic function of τ with XS(τ ) lying on the closed paths determined by f⊥(X, Y ) = f⊥(0, 0).
The size of the paths depends only on p :
it is inﬁnite (straight line) at p = 0 and decays to zero as p increases.
The period is proportional to (M bη0)−1. The decorrelation trajectories are thus obtained as XS(τ (t)) where XS(τ )
is the solution of (65). This show that the trajectories wind around the closed paths (for an incomplete turn or
for many turns, depending on M and on the parameters p, b and η0); at the time corresponding to the maximum

This is identical with the asymptotic behavior obtained from the quasilinear solution (62). Thus, the stochastic
generation of magnetic islands that appear at ﬁnite λ⊥ does not aﬀect either the asymptotic time-dependence of the
running diﬀusion coeﬃcient or its dependence on the parameters.

≪

There is however a signiﬁcant eﬀect of the nonlinear process of magnetic island generation but it appears to be
localized in time.
It can be found by determining the whole time evolution of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient (58) using
the computer code we have developed. The results are presented in Figures 1 and 2 compared to the solution (61),
1. One can see that at small and large times the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is equal to D0(t). For
(62) obtained for M
intermediary times a transient decrease of D(t) appears. This is determined by the magnetic line trapping around
stochastic magnetic islands, which is eﬀective at times larger than the ﬂight time over the perpendicular correlation
length λ⊥, which in the unit considered here is τf l = 1/M. As seen in Figures 1 and 2, the running diﬀusion
coeﬃcient has a maximum at τf l and the Lagrangian velocity correlation becomes negative. Then the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient decreases due to the trapping of the magnetic lines which wind around stochastic island. This process
is represented by the decorrelation trajectories corresponding to subensembles with large values of the parameter
p = φ0/b which have performed many rotations around their paths (of small size) and their contribution cancels by
mixing in the integrals in Eq.(57). Later in the evolution, another change of the sign of the Lagrangian correlation
is observed at t = τr, the average return time for the parallel motion. At this moment D(t) has a minimum while
D0(t) has a maximum. It is determined by the parallel motion and more exactly by the collisions which force the
particles to return on the magnetic lines. This is reﬂected in the decorrelation trajectories, which all evolve back on
their paths in the perpendicular plane at t > τr. In the absence of the magnetic line trapping (quasilinear conditions)
this leads to the decay of the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient because the perpendicular displacement decreases in time
and thus D0(t) decays at t > τr. The eﬀect is inverse in the presence of stochastic magnetic islands. The backward
motion produces ﬁrst the un-mixing of the contribution of the trajectories that evolve on trapped magnetic lines.
As time increases, the contributions of smaller and smaller magnetic islands are recovered in the Lagrangian velocity
correlation. The eﬀect of magnetic line trapping that produced the decay of D(t) in the interval (τf l, τr) is washed out
by the backward motion and D(t) recovers its value at t
τf l. At this moment τb, the correlation built-up time, D(t)
has a maximum. A positive bump appears in the Lagrangian velocity correlation due to the trajectories unwinding
around the magnetic islands. Finally, all decorrelation trajectories are ”in phase” and approach the origin. This
corresponds to the asymptotic regime in the evolution of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(t) which is the same as for D0(t).
Thus, the parallel collisional motion eliminates asymptotically the nonlinearity determined by the x-dependence of
the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations.

We show in the next sections that this rather nontrivial evolution of the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient leads to

anomalous diﬀusion regimes when a decorrelation mechanism is present.

V. DIFFUSIVE TRANSPORT INDUCED BY COLLISIONAL DECORRELATION

We analyze in this section the eﬀect of the cross-ﬁeld collisional diﬀusion (χ⊥ 6

= 0) starting from the general
solution (56)-(58). The stochastic collisional velocity η⊥(t) in Eq.(3) moves the particles out of the magnetic lines
and consequently it has a decorrelation eﬀect leading to diﬀusive transport. This collisional motion determines
a characteristic time, the perpendicular decorrelation time τ⊥. It is deﬁned by the condition that the collisional
diﬀusion covers the perpendicular correlation length, 2χ⊥τ⊥ = λ2
⊥, and in the units chosen here it is τ⊥ = (2χ⊥)−1.
The stochastic magnetic ﬁeld is considered here to be static (τ c =
) for a better understanding of the collisional
decorrelation.

∞

As in the previous section, a stochastic magnetic ﬁeld with small Kubo number Km that does not generate stochastic
magnetic islands is ﬁrst considered. We show analytically that the already known results are reproduced by the
decorrelation trajectory method. Then the nonlinear case is analyzed and new anomalous diﬀusion regimes are found.
They are determined by the non-linear interaction of the magnetic line trapping with the cross-ﬁeld collisional diﬀusion.
In 1979 Kadomtsev and Pogutse [2] derived semi-qualitatively an approximation for the cross-ﬁeld diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient. This approximation is essentially a weak-nonlinearity regime, in which the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are
non-chaotic. It will be shown that this diﬀusion coeﬃcient is obtained from the general equations (56)-(58) provided
that τr < τ⊥ < τf l. This condition is compatible with the relations found in [11] where a detailed study of the
diﬀusion regimes in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds for fusion plasmas is presented. In this conditions the XS-dependence
of the average velocity in Eqs.(53), (54) can be neglected and the equations for the decorrelation trajectories are
(59) corrected by a factor n2
⊥(t) that multiplies the right hand side terms. This leads to the following form of the
Lagrangian velocity correlation

where L0(t) is the subdiﬀusive Lagrangian velocity autocorrelation deﬁned in Eq. (61). Because of the factor n2
⊥(t),
the integral of LKP (t) no longer vanishes, and yields a ﬁnite diﬀusion coeﬃcient, DKP . It can be estimated analytically
by using a step approximation of the function n⊥(t)

LKP (t) = n2

⊥(t) L0(t),

It then follows that the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is approximated as:

which is the well-known Kadomtsev-Pogutse formula.

When the time of ﬂight τf l is smaller than the decorrelation time τ⊥, the space dependence of the magnetic
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations cannot be neglected. It leads to stochastic magnetic islands. In the presence of a perpendicular
collisional diﬀusivity the decorrelation trajectories obtained from Eq.(54) are not more closed curves. However,
trajectory winding can still be observed for some range of the parameters that deﬁne the subensembles. This means
that the process of generation of stochastic magnetic island and of magnetic line trapping still exists. Compared to
the decorrelation trajectories obtained with χ⊥ = 0, these trajectories saturate faster and perform a smaller number
of rotations. They still turn back at the maximum of the function τ (t) which shows that the parallel trapping
determined by the parallel collisional motion still exists. But due to the cross ﬁeld collisional diﬀusion, these two
trapping processes are only approximate or temporary. The perpendicular diﬀusion χ⊥ produces a releasing eﬀect both
for perpendicular and parallel components of particle motion. The asymptotic values of the decorrelation trajectories
are not concentrated in the origin (as for χ⊥ = 0) but spread in the (X, Y ) plane. Consequently, a ﬁnite value of the
asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient yields from Eq.(57).

The asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient is determined from Eq.(57) using the numerical code we have developed. Some
results are presented in Figure 3 where the asymptotic value of D(t) is represented as a function of χ⊥. The two
components Dint and χ⊥ are also represented. One can see that at small collisional diﬀusion χ⊥ ≪
1, the non-linear
interaction term largely dominates the collisional term while at large collisional diﬀusion χ⊥ & 1, the nonlinear term
is only a correction to χ⊥. Thus, the subdiﬀusive transport appearing at χ⊥ = 0 is transformed by a small collisional
cross ﬁeld diﬀusion into a diﬀusive transport with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient that can be several orders of magnitude
larger than χ⊥. The dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient on χ⊥ is rather nontrivial. There is at very small χ⊥ an
increase of D up to a maximum which corresponds to τ⊥ ∼= τb. Then, at larger χ⊥, the nonlinear interaction of the
parallel and perpendicular trapping with the collisional decorrelation generates a strange transport regime, in which
the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient decreases as the collisional diﬀusion χ⊥ increases. A minimum of D is obtained when
χ⊥ determines a decorrelation time of the order of the return time of the parallel motion, τ⊥ ∼= τr. At larger χ⊥ (when
τ⊥ < τr), the nonlinear contribution Dint increases again with the increase of χ⊥ but this contribution begins to be
comparable and eventually negligible compared to the collisional diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

We note that the above results obtained with the decorrelation trajectory method are not similar with the heuristic
estimation of the asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient of Rechester and Rosenbluth [1]. This is possibly due to the fact that
the trapping of the magnetic lines, which is profoundly implied in the above results, is neglected in the estimation [1]
and also in the more detailed calculations presented in [10]. This estimation is based on the process of exponential
increase of the average distance between two magnetic lines in a chaotic magnetic ﬁeld, represented by the Kolmogorov
length. The estimation of this length taking into account the trapping of the magnetic lines should be necessary in
order to compare the results.

VI. DIFFUSIVE TRANSPORT IN TIME-DEPENDENT STOCHASTIC MAGNETIC FIELDS

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

In a time-dependent stochastic magnetic ﬁeld with ﬁnite τc the conﬁguration of the stochastic ﬁeld b(x, z, t) changes,
the magnetic lines move and consequently the perpendicular velocity of the particles is decorrelated leading to diﬀusive
transport. We determine here the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in such time-dependent ﬁelds in the limit of zero Larmor radius,
stating from the general solution (56)-(57). The eﬀect of time variation of the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld on the eﬀective
1). We determine the
diﬀusion was previously studied in [17]- [21] but only for weak magnetic turbulence (Km ≪
eﬀect of stochastic island generation appearing in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds at Km > 1.

The decorrelation trajectories obtained from Eqs.(53), (54) are in this case (ﬁnite τc, χ⊥ = 0) situated on closed
paths (except that for p = 0). A typical trajectory rotates on the corresponding path, then it stops and turns back.
Its velocity decays progressively and eventually the trajectory stops somewhere on its path. This is the modiﬁcation
determined by the time variation of the magnetic ﬁeld: all decorrelation trajectories stop at a time of the order τ c.
Consequently, the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient saturates. Depending on the relation between the decorrelation time
In
τ c and the three characteristic times of this motion, τf l, τr, τb (see Fig. 2) several diﬀusion regimes are obtained.
time-dependent magnetic ﬁelds, at t < τc, the time evolution of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is approximately the same
with that obtained for τ c → ∞
, and later, at t > τc, D(t) saturates. Thus, the asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient can be
evaluated as

).

(71)

using the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient obtained in the static case. Thus it can be approximating by the value of the
running diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the subdiﬀusive case at t = τ c. Some results are presented in Figure 4 where the
asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient obtained from Eq.(58) for ﬁnite τ c is compared to the subdiﬀusive running diﬀusion
coeﬃcient represented in Figure 2. One can see that the approximation (71) is rather good for all values of τ c.

The following diﬀusion regimes can be observed in Figure 4, in the nonlinear conditions when stochastic magnetic
islands are generated (τf l < τr, or Km > 1). The quasilinear regime at small correlation times (τ c < τf l) with
M 2τ c is characterized by a fast time-variation which prevents trajectory trapping. At larger correlation
D0 ≈
times (τf l < τ c < τr) the stochastic magnetic islands can be generated before the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld changes
and the parallel motion is ballistic. In these conditions the diﬀusion regime is similar to that described in [16] for
the electrostatic turbulence: the diﬀusion coeﬃcient decreases with the increase of τ c. A minimum of the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient appears at τ c ∼= τr, followed by an anomalous increase determined by the interaction of the parallel trapping
with the magnetic line trapping which generates correlation of the Lagrangian velocities. At very large correlation

. We note that the regimes obtained for τ c < τf l
times (τ c > τb) the diﬀusion coeﬃcient decreases as D
and for τ c > τb are similar with those reported in [17], [18]. But instead of the plateau found there at intermediary
τ c, we obtain here a more complicated behavior. This is the eﬀect of stochastic magnetic island generation: it leads
to the decrease of the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient with the increase of τ c when the parallel motion is ballistic and,
on the contrary, to the increase of D with the increase of τ c when the parallel motion is diﬀusive.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied here the transport of collisional particles in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds using the decorrelation tra-
jectory method. We have derived analytical expressions for the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient and for the Lagrangian
velocity correlation in terms of a set of deterministic trajectories. They are deﬁned in subensembles of the realizations
of the stochastic ﬁeld as solution of diﬀerential (Hamiltonian) equations that depend on the given Eulerian correlation
of the stochastic potential. They are approximations of the subensemble average trajectories and represent the dy-
namics of the decorrelation of the Lagrangian velocity. Since in general the equations for the decorrelation trajectories
cannot be solved analytically, a computer code was developed for determining the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient for
arbitrary values of the four parameters of this problem and for given Eulerian correlation of the potential.

We have shown that this rather complicated triple stochastic process is characterized by two kinds of trajectory
trappings and contains two decorrelation mechanisms. The latter are produced by the collisional cross ﬁeld diﬀusion
χ⊥ and by the time variation of the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld.

One of the trapping processes concerns the parallel motion and is determined by collisions which constrain the
particles to return in the already visited places with probability one. This parallel trapping leads to a subdiﬀusive
transport in the absence of a decorrelation mechanism. This already known process is recovered by our method.
The second kind of trapping concerns the magnetic lines which at Km > 1 wind around the extrema of the vector
potential generating self-consistently magnetic islands. The eﬀects of the magnetic line trapping in the presence of
particle collisions is studied for the ﬁrst time. We show that in the absence of a decorrelation mechanism, the stochastic
magnetic islands determine a transitory decay of the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(t) appearing at t in the interval
(τf l, τr), i.e. before the parallel trapping is eﬀective. The simultaneous action of both trapping processes determine
a nonlinear built up of Lagrangian velocity correlation and eventually the parallel motion washes out the eﬀect of the
magnetic line trapping. Consequently, the asymptotic behavior of the running diﬀusion coeﬃcient is exactly the same
as in the quasilinear conditions when the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld does not generate magnetic islands.

The eﬀect of the two decorrelation mechanisms is afterwards studied. We show that the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient
and its dependence on the parameters results from a competition between the trapping and the decorrelation processes
and more precisely from the temporal ordering of the characteristic times of these processes. Each one of the two
decorrelation mechanisms leads to the already known diﬀusion laws when the stochastic magnetic islands are not
1). Their presence (at Km > 1) produces a complicated nonlinear interaction between the three
present (Km ≪
stochastic processes which determines new scaling laws of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. They appear when the decorrelation
time is longer than the ﬂight time τf l but smaller than the correlation built up time τb. The ﬁrst condition ensures the
magnetic islands generation and the second prevents the elimination of their trapping eﬀect by the parallel collisional
motion. A particularly interesting regime is obtained for collisional decorrelation and consists of an eﬀective diﬀusion
coeﬃcient that decreases when the collisional perpendicular diﬀusion increases (Fig. 3).

This rather complex dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients on the plasma parameters can be used in experiments
for controlling the transport. Even without changing the characteristics of the stochastic magnetic ﬁeld, the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient can be strongly inﬂuenced by the parameters which describe particle collisions. A minimum of the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient was obtained for decorrelation times of the order of the average return time for the parallel motion.

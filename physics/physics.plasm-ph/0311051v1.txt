ABSTRACT

Dept. of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin, 475 N Charter Street, Madison WI 53706

We consider stochastic reconnection in a magnetized, partially ionized
medium. Stochastic reconnection is a generic eﬀect, due to ﬁeld line wander-
ing, in which the speed of reconnection is determined by the ability of ejected
plasma to diﬀuse away from the current sheet along magnetic ﬁeld lines, rather
than by the details of current sheet structure. As in earlier work, in which we
dealt with a fully ionized plasma, we consider the limit of weak stochasticity, so
that the mean magnetic ﬁeld energy density is greater than either the turbulent
kinetic energy density or the energy density associated with the ﬂuctuating com-
ponent of the ﬁeld. For speciﬁcity, we consider ﬁeld line stochasticity generated
through a turbulent cascade, which leads us to consider the eﬀect of neutral drag

Introduction

One of the fundamental properties of astrophysical magnetic ﬁelds is their ability to
change topology via reconnection (see Priest & Forbes, 2000). It is impossible to understand
the origin and evolution of large scale magnetic ﬁelds without understanding the mobility
of magnetic ﬁeld lines. In a typical astrophysical plasma, resistivity is very small and ﬂux
freezing, which follows from assuming zero resistivity, should be an excellent guide to the
motion of magnetic ﬁelds. In spite of this, fast magnetic dynamo theory (see Parker, 1979;
Moﬀatt, 1978; Krause & Radler, 1980) invokes a constantly changing magnetic ﬁeld topology
and motions during which ﬁeld lines cross each other1. This assumption is supported by
observations of the solar magnetic ﬁeld (see Dere, 1996; Innes, Inhester, Axford & Wilhelm,
1997, and references contained therein) which are diﬃcult to explain unless ﬂux freezing is
routinely violated on time scales short compared to resistive time scales, at least within thin
current sheets.

The Sweet-Parker model of reconnection is the simplest and most robust (Parker, 1957;
Sweet, 1958). In this model, reconnection takes place within a thin current sheet, which
separates two large volumes containing uniform, and very diﬀerent, magnetic ﬁelds. The
resulting reconnection speed is less than the Alfv´en speed by the square root of the Lundquist
number ∼ R−1/2
L = (η/VAL)1/2, where η is the resistivity, VA is the Alfv´en speed, and L is
the length of the current sheet, assumed to be determined by the large scale geometry of

1While standard mean-ﬁeld dynamo theory has been severely criticized on theoretical and numerical
grounds (Vainshtein & Cattaneo, 1992; Gruzinov & Diamond, 1994, 1996; Cattaneo & Hughes, 1996; Hughes
et al., 1996; Brandenburg, 2001), an alternative version can be formulated which evades these criticisms
(Vishniac & Cho, 2001) and which assumes fast reconnection only on two dimensional surfaces.

– 3 –

the problem. Under typical astrophysical conditions this is very slow (e.g. for the Galaxy
as a whole RL ∼ 1020). This reconnection speed is set by a geometrical constraint. Indeed,
plasma tied to the reconnecting magnetic ﬁeld lines must be ejected from the ends of the
narrow current sheet. The disparity of scales, one of which is macroscopic/astrophysical,
while the other is microscopic, i.e. determined by ohmic diﬀusion, makes the reconnection
slow.

This evident shortcoming of the Sweet-Parker reconnection scheme has stimulated inter-
est in alternative models that allow fast reconnection. Although the literature on magnetic
reconnection is extensive (e.g. Priest & Forbes, 2000, and references therein) it does not
successfully address this question. Models that invoke an X-point reconnection geometry
(Petschek, 1964) have been shown to be unstable for suﬃciently high RL (see Biskamp,
1996), while anomalous resistivity fails to provide rapid reconnection under most astrophys-
ical conditions (see Parker, 1979). A general review of astrophysical magnetic reconnection
theory can be found in Bhattacharjee, Ma, & Wang (2003).

A notable exception to this discouraging state of aﬀairs is the recent work on fast col-
lisionless reconnection (Biskamp, Schwarz & Drake, 1997; Shay, Drake, Denton & Biskamp,
1998; Shay & Drake, 1998, see also the discussion by Bhattacharjee, Ma and Wang 2001).
This work indicates that under some circumstances a kind of standing whistler mode can
stabilize an X-point reconnection region. However, these studies have not demonstrated the
possibility of fast reconnection for generic ﬁeld geometries. They assume that there are no
bulk forces acting to produce a large scale current sheet, and that the magnetized regions
are convex, which minimizes the energy required to spread the ﬁeld lines. In addition, this
mechanism requires a collisionless environment, where the electron mean free path is less
than the current sheet thickness (Trintchouk, Yamada, Ji, Kulsrud & Carter, 2003; Ji, Ya-
mada, Hsu & Kulsrud, 1998). Unfortunately, in the laboratory the current sheet thickness
is comparable to the ion Larmor radius and it is unclear how to generalize this criterion to
the interstellar medium, where the Sweet-Parker current sheet thickness is typically much
greater than the Larmor radius. If we require that the ion skin depth, the characteristic
scale of the standing Whistler mode, be greater than the current sheet thickness, then we
have a criterion which is rarely satisﬁed in the interstellar medium. In this paper we will
concentrate on a mechanism that acts in turbulent media and when it works, produces rapid
reconnection under a broad range of ﬁeld geometries, without regard to the particle collision
rate. We will defer all discussion of the relationship between stochastic reconnection and
small scale collisionless eﬀects to a later paper.

In a previous paper (Lazarian & Vishniac, 1999, henceforth LV99) we discussed ‘stochas-
tic reconnection’, a process which is similar to Sweet-Parker reconnection, except that

– 4 –

stochastic wandering of the ﬁeld lines produces a broad outﬂow region. The properties
of the outﬂow region are insensitive to the width of the current sheet (and the value of RL),
but depend on the level of ﬁeld line stochasticity. In a suﬃciently noisy environment the
reconnection speed becomes a large fraction of the Alfv´en speed. In an extremely quiet envi-
ronment the ﬁeld lines do not enter or leave the current sheet over its entire length and we
recover the Sweet-Parker reconnection model. In LV99 we dealt with an inviscid and totally
ionized ﬂuid. 2

The notion that magnetic ﬁeld stochasticity might aﬀect current sheet structures is
not unprecedented. In earlier work Speiser (1970) showed that in collisionless plasmas the
electron collision time should be replaced with the time a typical electron is retained in the
current sheet. Also Jacobson & Moses (1984) proposed that current diﬀusivity should be
modiﬁed to include diﬀusion of electrons across the mean ﬁeld due to small scale stochasticity.
These eﬀects will usually be small compared to eﬀect of a broad outﬂow zone containing both
plasma and ejected shared magnetic ﬂux. Moreover, while both of these eﬀects will aﬀect
reconnection rates, they are not suﬃcient to produce reconnection speeds comparable to the
Alfv´en speed in most astrophysical environments.

It is important to distinguish between stochastic reconnection, as discussed in LV99,
and the more conventional notion of turbulent reconnection. The latter usually involves
substituting a turbulent diﬀusivity for the resistivity, and involves a degree of small-scale
mixing which is forbidden on energetic grounds (see §2 in Parker, 1992, and the references
contained therein). A common variation of this hypothesis is that instabilities in the current
sheet will produce a hugely broadened current sheet and a large eﬀective resistivity within it
(for a review see Biskamp, 2000). On the contrary, the former is largely a topological eﬀect,
using conventional estimates of resistivity, and the only strong mixing associated with it has
to do with the polarization of ﬁeld lines crossing the current sheet. (That is, one expects
sharp gradients, in the current sheet, in the component of the magnetic lines perpendicular
to the current sheet.) In this sense, stochastic reconnection belongs to the class of models
which try to explain fast reconnection by appealing to a current sheet geometry which is
‘natural’ in some sense, but evades the limits set by the Sweet-Parker model. (The bulk
of the discussion in Priest & Forbes (2000) is centered on laminar three dimensional ﬁeld
conﬁgurations which can lead to similarly rapid reconnection speeds.)

In a recent paper Kim & Diamond (2001) addressed the problem of stochastic recon-
nection by calculating the turbulent diﬀusion rate for magnetic ﬂux inside a current sheet.

2In this paper we shall show that this approximation is valid for partially ionized collisionless plasma up

to a certain percentage of neutrals, and for collisional gases with resistivity larger than viscosity.

– 5 –

They obtained similar turbulent diﬀusion rates for both two dimensional and reduced three
dimensional MHD. In both cases the presence of turbulence had a negligible eﬀect on the
ﬂux transport. The authors pointed out that this would prevent the anomalous transport of
magnetic ﬂux within the current sheet and concluded that both 2D and 3D stochastic recon-
nection proceed at the Sweet-Parker rate even if individual small scale reconnection events
happen quickly. If true this would be not only rule out the LV99 reconnection scheme, but
also any other fast reconnection scheme. In general astrophysical plasmas are turbulent and
if the enhancement of the local reconnection speed, e.g. due to collisionless eﬀects (see Drake
et al. 2001), is irrelevant then reconnection must always be slow.

However turbulent diﬀusion rates within the current sheet are irrelevant for the process
of stochastic reconnection or, for broadly similar reasons, fast collisionless reconnection.
The basic claim in LV99 is that realistic magnetic ﬁeld topologies allow multiple connections
between the current sheet and the exterior environment, which would persist even if the
stochastic magnetic ﬁeld lines were stationary (”frozen in time”) before reconnection. This
leads to global outﬂow constraints which are weak and do not depend on the properties of the
current sheet. In particular, the analysis in LV99 assumed that the current sheet thickness
is determined purely by ohmic dissipation and that turbulent diﬀusion of the magnetic ﬁeld
is negligible inside, and outside, the current sheet. The major uncertainty in this model is
the behavior of the reconnected ﬂux elements, which are nearly perpendicular to the current
sheet and must undergo multiple reconnections before being ejected. We note also that
models of collisionless reconnection also evade the objection posed by Kim and Diamond
topologically, that is, by stabilizing an X-point reconnection topology, and opening up the
rest of the current sheet.

”Hyper-resistivity” (Strauss, 1985; Bhattacharjee & Hameiri, 1986; Hameiri & Bhat-
tacharjee, 1987) is a more subtle attempt to derive fast reconnection from turbulence within
the context of mean-ﬁeld resistive MHD. The form of the parallel electric ﬁeld can be derived
from magnetic helicity conservation. Integrating by parts one obtains a term which looks
like an eﬀective resistivity proportional to the magnetic helicity current. There are several
assumptions implicit in this derivation, but the most important problem is that by adopt-
ing a mean-ﬁeld approximation one is already assuming some sort of small-scale smearing
eﬀect, equivalent to fast reconnection. Strauss (1988) partially circumvented this problem
by examining the eﬀect of tearing mode instabilities within current sheets. However, the
resulting reconnection speed enhancement is roughly what one would expect based simply
on the broadening of the current sheets due to internal mixing. This eﬀect does not allow
us to evade the constraints on the global plasma ﬂow that lead to slow reconnection speeds,
a point which has been demonstrated numerically (Matthaeus & Lamkin, 1985) and analyt-
ically (LV99). Nevertheless, we show in §4 that this eﬀect may be important in the densest

– 6 –

and coldest parts of the ISM.

A partially ionized plasma ﬁlls a substantial volume within our galaxy and the earlier
stages of star formation take place in a largely neutral medium. This motivates our study
of the eﬀect of neutrals on reconnection. The role of ion-neutral collisions is not trivial. On
one hand, they may truncate the turbulent cascade, reducing the small scale stochasticity
and decreasing the reconnection speed. On the other hand, the ability of neutrals to diﬀuse
perpendicular to magnetic ﬁeld lines allows for a broader particle outﬂow and enhances
reconnection rates.

Reconnection in partially ionized gases has been already studied by various authors
(Naidu, McKenzie & Axford, 1992; Zweibel & Brandenburg, 1997). In a recent study (Vish-
niac & Lazarian, 1999, henceforth VL99) we studied the diﬀusion of neutrals away from the
reconnection zone assuming anti-parallel magnetic ﬁeld lines (see also Heitsch & Zweibel,
2003a) The ambipolar reconnection rates obtained in VL99, although large compared with
the Sweet-Parker model, are insuﬃcient either for fast dynamo models or for the ejection
of magnetic ﬂux prior to star formation.
In fact, the increase in the reconnection speed
stemmed entirely from the compression of ions in the current sheet, with the consequent
enhancement of both recombination and ohmic dissipation. This eﬀect is small unless the
reconnecting magnetic ﬁeld lines are almost exactly anti-parallel (Vishniac & Lazarian, 1999;
Heitsch & Zweibel, 2003b). Any dynamically signiﬁcant shared ﬁeld component will prevent
noticeable plasma compression in the current sheet, and lead to speeds practically indis-
tinguishable from the standard Sweet-Parker result. Since generic reconnection regions will
have a shared ﬁeld component of the same order as the reversing component, the implication
is that reconnection and ambipolar diﬀusion do not change reconnection speed estimates
signiﬁcantly.

None of this work on reconnection in partially ionized plasmas includes the eﬀects of
stochasticity. We expect that in the presence of turbulence, reconnection rates will be
substantially enhanced, as they are in completely ionized plasmas. To generalize the concept
of stochastic reconnection to partially ionized plasmas we need a model for the small scale
stochasticity of a turbulent magnetic ﬁeld in a partially ionized plasma. In this paper we
will begin by considering this problem, and then apply our results to the reconnection speed.

Following LV99, we consider reconnection in the presence of a weakly stochastic mag-
netic ﬁeld. Except for the presence of noise, we imagine a reconnection event exactly like
a generic Sweet-Parker reconnection event. Two volumes with average magnetic ﬁelds that
are of comparable strength, but diﬀering directions are in contact over a surface of length
L. Due to the stochastic nature of the ﬁelds, ﬁeld lines come into contact over many small
patches (see Fig. 1). For each individual patch the Sweet-Parker reconnection model should

– 7 –

be applicable (or at least constitute a minimal reconnection speed). The enhancement of
reconnection rates follows from two eﬀects. First, since individual ﬁeld lines wander out of
the narrow current sheet relatively easily, the longitudinal patch size is much smaller than
the overall size of the system. This reduces the eﬀective value of RL and raises the local
reconnection speed. Second, whereas in the Sweet-Parker scheme magnetic ﬁeld lines recon-
nect sequentially, in the presence of ﬁeld line wandering ﬁeld lines many independent patches
are brought into direct contact and can reconnect simultaneously. As a consequence, the
rate of reconnection of the magnetic ﬂux is increased by a large factor, whose exact value
depends on the level of noise in the system.

In LV99 the truncation of the turbulent cascade was assumed to be due to resistivity.
Consequently, the smallest scale of ﬁeld line wandering decreases as resistivity decreases, and
the number of independent patches in contact within the reconnection zone increases. From
this we concluded that for an idealized inviscid ﬂuid the reconnection rate does not depend
on ﬂuid resistivity. It does depend on the level of magnetic ﬁeld stochasticity. In the speciﬁc
case where the ﬁeld line stochasticity is caused by a turbulent cascade, it depends on the
amplitude of the turbulence. However, there is no necessary connection between turbulent
motions and the reconnection speed. In particular, the rate of turbulent transport of mean
magnetic ﬂux is assumed to be negligible in this model, and even the complete absence of
turbulent diﬀusion in the current sheet would not reduce the stochastic reconnection rate
(cf. Kim & Diamond, 2001).

To quantify stochastic reconnection we have to use a particular description of turbu-
lence. Motions in a magnetized medium can be expanded into incompressible (Alfv´en) and
compressible (fast and slow) modes. There are theoretical arguments (Goldreich & Sridhar,
1995; Lithwick & Goldreich, 2001) (see Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac 2003a, for a review) sug-
gesting that the nonlinear cascade of power for these modes proceeds separately, although
not entirely independently. Simulations in Cho & Lazarian (2002) support this idea and show
that the Goldreich & Sridhar (1995, henceforth GS95) scaling is applicable to Alfvenic part
of the MHD cascade. For our purposes the scalings of slow and fast modes (Cho & Lazarian,
2002), (Cho & Lazarian, 2003) are less important since they are subjected to collisionless
damping3

Here we assume that the GS95 model describes incompressible turbulence above the

3Whether or not those damped modes are important depends on the process studied. For instance, Yan
& Lazarian (2002) show that for scattering of cosmic rays the residual small amplitude fast modes are much
more eﬃcient than the Alfv´en modes. This, however, is not true for the ﬁeld wandering that we consider in
this paper.

– 8 –

ambipolar damping scale4. To describe MHD turbulence below the scale of viscous damp-
ing we present a new model of magnetic ﬁeld structure in this regime. This model is in
rough agreement with numerical simulations by Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac (2002b, hence-
forth CLV02b).

In §2 of this paper we will consider the eﬀect of a large neutral fraction on a strongly
turbulent cascade in a magnetized plasma. In §3 we apply this to the problem of reconnection
in partially ionized plasmas. In §4 we apply this work to various phases in the ISM. Finally,
§5 contains our basic conclusions.

2. Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence in a Partially Ionized Plasma

In this section we will consider the eﬀect of neutral particles on the turbulent cascade in
the ISM. We begin by brieﬂy reviewing the nature of the strong turbulent MHD cascade and
the dynamical inﬂuence of neutral particles. In §2.2 we describe the cascade when viscous
damping, due to neutral particles, is strong, but the one ﬂuid approximation remains valid.
In §2.3 we consider the uncoupled regime, covering scales where the neutral particles exert
a uniform drag on all motions. We end, in §2.4, with a brief discussion of the implications
of this picture for observations of turbulence in the ISM.

2.1. Neutral-ion damping

The role of neutral-ion damping in MHD turbulence has been discussed previously in
the context of the ISM (in particular, see Spangler, 1991; Minter & Spangler, 1997). The
basic conclusion was that neutral ﬂuid heating is a plausible sink for the turbulent energy
revealed through measurements of interstellar scintillation. Here we are concerned instead
with how a neutral gas component will modify the turbulent power spectrum. The most
relevant observational point is that the ISM turbulent power spectrum has no strong fea-
tures at wavelengths where neutral-ion coupling would be expected to play a dominant role
(Armstrong, Rickett & Spangler, 1997). Instead, the power spectrum extends to very small
scales (< 108 cm) in an approximate power law. Qualitatively, this suggests that stochas-
tic reconnection can take place even in partially neutral plasmas. However, several basic

4We note, however, that our qualitative conclusions for reconnection rates should be valid for other models
of MHD turbulence (see LV99) as long as they are in rough agreement with observational constraints and
numerical simulations.

– 9 –

questions remain unanswered. Previous work on turbulence in the ISM has not included
a discussion of the most plausible model for MHD turbulence (although a simple hydrody-
namic model was addressed, which is remarkably close to the model we use here). Also, we
need to understand why neutral damping fails to produce a strong signature in the ISM,
or at least in the diﬀuse ionized component of the ISM, before we can construct a general
model for its role in partially ionized plasmas.

2.1.1. The Goldreich-Sridhar model

The GS95 model of strong MHD turbulence is based on the notion of a Kolmogorov-like
cascade with an anisotropy imposed by the large scale magnetic ﬁeld. The exact degree of
anisotropy follows from an average balance between hydrodynamic and magnetic forces. Ed-
dies on a given scale are characterized by a wavenumber perpendicular to the mean magnetic
ﬁeld direction, k⊥, and a parallel wavenumber, kk, such that the rate of eddy turnover time
is equal to the rate wave propagation along magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.

k⊥vk ≈ kkVA ,

(1)

where vk is the typical velocity at the scale characterized by the wavenumber (kk, k⊥). As vk
goes down with the increase of k⊥ this condition implies eddies that are elongated along the
ﬁeld direction, and become more elongated as we go to smaller scales. In order to simplify
our notation, we will refer to k⊥ below as k.

If energy is injected isotropically on some scale l, with vl ≤ VA, then the cascade will
begin in a regime of weak turbulence, in which motions can be characterized as weakly
interacting waves, with a frequency ω = kkVA ∼constant and a nonlinear decay rate (see
discussion in a review by Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac 2003)

This model presupposes that the turbulent velocities are subalfvenic, and we adopt
this assumption in the rest of this paper. This is less restrictive than it might appear,
since as long as there is some scale l′ in the turbulent cascade where vl′ ∼ VA we can take
l = l′ ≈ k−1
T , vT = vl = VA and use this model of turbulence for all smaller scales. Moreover,
if the turbulent energy is larger than the magnetic energy, we can expect rapid growth of the
magnetic ﬁeld through the turbulent dynamo, that is, the generation of a disordered ﬁeld
in rough equipartition with the turbulent kinetic energy (see, however, Schekochihin et al.
2003).

The Goldreich-Sridhar scalings can be easily understood. They reﬂect the fact that on

small scales it is diﬃcult to bend magnetic ﬁeld lines, but it is still easy to mix them up.

Ion-neutral decoupling: theoretical considerations

The preceding discussion assumes that the plasma is a single, tightly coupled, ﬂuid
with negligible viscosity. Many astrophysical ﬂuids are partially ionized, the neutrals are
imperfectly coupled to the ions. An obvious consequence is a substantially increased viscosity
since the neutrals can cross magnetic ﬁeld lines.

The coupling between ions and neutrals is determined by the rate of ion-neutral colli-

sions, which is

t−1

mn
mn + mi

(10)

where vr is the ion-neutral relative velocity, σin is the ion-neutral collisional cross section,
mi and mn are the typical ion and neutral masses, nn is the neutral number density, and
angular brackets denote averaging. From (Draine, Roberge & Dalgarno, 1983) we adopt
hvrσini ≈ 1.9 × 10−9 cm3 s−1. The rate at which neutrals exchange momentum with ions is
t−1
ni = t−1

in ρi/ρn.

If the mean free path for a neutral particle, ln, in a partially ionized gas with density
ntot = nn + ni is much less than the size of the eddies under consideration, i.e. lnk ≪ 1, the

Consider ﬁrst a mostly neutral gas (i.e. ni ≫ nn). Turbulence can cascade to small
scales if the turbulent eddy rate τ −1 ∼ kvk is larger than the viscous damping rate t−1
damping.
In a partially ionized gas the one ﬂuid approximation is valid if neutrals experience multiple
collisions with ions in an eddy turnover time, i.e. t−1
ni > τ −1. Therefore, MHD turbulence
will exhibit Goldreich-Sridhar scaling up to the damping scale if t−1
damping. On the other
hand, if t−1
damping neutrals will not follow the ions and magnetic ﬁelds. Instead they will
form a hydrodynamic cascade as soon as the neutral-ion collisional rate t−1
is of the order of

5The viscosity across magnetic ﬁeld lines, due to ion-ion collisions, is typically small as ion motions are
constrained by the magnetic ﬁeld. For a collision rate much smaller than the ion cyclotron frequency the
ratio of ion perpendicular viscosity to resistivity is a few times the ratio of the ion thermal pressure to the
magnetic pressure. In the collisional limit this is multiplied by a factor of (Ωi/νi)2 ≪ 1, and resistivity
eﬃciently dissipates magnetic ﬁeld perturbations on scales greater than the viscous damping scale. The drag
coeﬃcient for neutral-neutral collisions is ∼ 1.5 × 10−10T 1/3 cm3 s−1 with T measured in Kelvins (Spitzer,
1978), so collisions with other neutrals will dominate for ni/nn less than ∼ 0.08T 1/3.

What will happen to the magnetic ﬁelds when ionic motions are damped? Collisions
between the ions and the neutral particles will prevent magnetic tension from straightening
the ﬁeld lines eﬃciently.
Instead they will be moved, entangled and stretched by large
undamped eddies. As the eddy turnover rate increases with the decrease of the scale, the
marginally damped eddies at the damping scale will the most important. This implies a
picture very diﬀerent from the Goldreich-Sridhar cascade.

If neutrals constitute a tiny impurity in the ionized plasma, it is clear that they cannot

aﬀect the MHD cascade. We shal quantify this intuitive picture below.

we express the value of ℵ at the viscous damping scale as ℵc, then we have two obvious
alternatives. Either ℵc > 1 and two-ﬂuid eﬀects are negligible right up to the damping scale,
or ℵc < 1 and the ions and neutrals decouple in the middle of the turbulent cascade. In
order to calculate ℵc we need to calculate viscous damping in the large ℵ limit.

Equation (22) seems to imply that ℵc must always be greater than one, but a closer
examination suggests that for ρi ≪ ρn the third term on the right hand side can be small
enough to oﬀset the second term. In fact, the value of ℵc has to be determined for each
situation. When ℵc ≪ 1 equations (18) through (21) have no physical meaning, since the
plasma stops behaving as a single ﬂuid when ℵ drops below one. Nevertheless, we can still
use these expressions as useful parameterizations of the turbulent cascade. In particular, if
ℵc < 1 then the scale of decoupling, when ℵ = 1, is given by

This expression has two roots. When the collision rate is so small that the ions and neutrals
are completely decoupled we have usual dispersion relation for Alfv´en waves

When the collision rate is large the two roots are

The latter root corresponds to the case where magnetic forces are negligible and the former is
the usual ambipolar diﬀusion rate, when the magnetic ﬁeld pushes the ions through a neutral
background. Neither limit is appropriate for hydrodynamic turbulence in the neutral ﬂuid,
in which case vn, τ , and k are imposed by the turbulent cascade. From equation (13) we
see that if the ions are prevented from moving by the magnetic ﬁeld then we get a damping
rate ∼ (ρi/ρn)t−1
in , which will be negligible once the hydrodynamic cascade has proceeded to
eddies with turn over rates larger than the decoupling rate. Since the hydrodynamic eddies
will be approximately isotropic, equation (12) guarantees that vi ≪ vn for all scales below
the decoupling scale.

The limit deﬁned by equation (25) has been previously considered (see, for example
Kulsrud & Pearce, 1969). We will ﬁnish this subsection by considering damping in this
regime, and the minimum neutral fraction required for neutral damping on any scale.

It is easy to see that equation (25) corresponds to the regime lnk ≫ 1 and the waves

Here we have assumed that the rms velocities of the ions and neutrals are dominated
by the thermal distribution. Our treatment should still be applicable when the turbulence
is supersonic, but sub-Alfv´enic (see discussion of the point in Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac
2002a), as long as we replace ci and cn with the appropriate rms turbulent velocities. This is
most likely to happen on large scales, so that lnk ≪ 1. In this case the viscosity contributed
by neutrals stays the same so that equation (17) does not require any modiﬁcations. In the
opposite limit, when kln ≫ 1, for supersonic turbulence hv2

However an increase in the ion velocity will result in a proportional increase in the drag
coeﬃcient, and a consequent drop in tin. Thus the condition provided by equation (27) does
not change.

Equations (17) and (27) can be used to ﬁnd the minimal neutral fraction required to
damp the turbulent cascade at scales close to ln. Together they imply a maximum damping
rate for kln ∼ 1. We see τ −1

as the minimal condition for dissipating an MHD turbulent cascade through neutral particle
viscosity. Typically, turbulent motions in the ISM are of order cn or greater, so only a small
neutral fraction is necessary to aﬀect the turbulent cascade. If there is a source of noise on
scales ≪ ln, such that damping given in equation (27) is ineﬀective, then neutral friction
can be ignored on all smaller scales. However, we will show in the following pages that small
scale turbulence can appear in a partially neutral plasma even in the absence of any small
scale driving.

2.2. The coupled regime: viscosity-damped turbulence

In this subsection we consider strong MHD turbulence with strong neutral particle

damping, but on scales where the one-ﬂuid approximation remains valid.

In hydrodynamic turbulence viscosity sets a minimal scale for motion, with an expo-
nential suppression of motion on smaller scales. Below the viscous cutoﬀ the kinetic energy
contained in a wavenumber band is dissipated at that scale, instead of being transferred to
smaller scales. This means the end of the hydrodynamic cascade, but in MHD turbulence

– 16 –

this is not the end of magnetic structure evolution. For viscosity much larger than resistiv-
ity, ν ≫ η, there will be a broad range of scales where viscosity is important but resistivity
is not. On these scales magnetic ﬁeld structures will be created through a combination of
large scale shear and the small scale motions generated by magnetic tension. As a result, we
expect a power-law tail in the energy distribution, rather than an exponential cutoﬀ.

Here we discuss a conservative model for the damped regime. It is motivated by sim-
ulations by Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac (2002b, henceforth CLV02b) and is consistent with
those simulations (see also Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac, 2003b). A complete understanding of
this regime will be deferred until higher numerical resolution runs are available and a more
detailed theoretical treatment has been completed. Our goal here is a model which can serve
as an approximate guide. We will construct this model using the notion of local interactions
in phase space (cf. Spangler, 1999), a constant cascade of energy to small scales, and a force
balance between magnetic tension and viscous forces. We add to this two ingredients that
are directly suggested by the simulations: a constant curvature for the ﬁeld lines and an
intermittent magnetic ﬁeld distribution.

To begin with we deﬁne a ﬁlling factor φk, which is the fraction of the volume containing
strong magnetic ﬁeld perturbations with a scale k−1. We denote the velocity and perturbed
magnetic ﬁeld inside these subvolumes with a “ˆ” so that

a rate τ −1

Consequently, bk ∼ bc for k > kc.

– 17 –

Next we assume that the curvature of the magnetic ﬁeld lines changes slowly, if at all,
in the cascade. This is consistent with a picture in which the cascade is driven by repeated
shearing at the same scale. It is also consistent with the numerical work described in CLV02b,
which yielded a constant kk throughout the viscously damped nonlinear cascade.

Finally, we can balance viscous and magnetic tension forces to ﬁnd

k2νˆvk ∼ kντ −1

c ∼ max[ˆbkkc, B0kk,c]ˆbk ∼ kcˆb2
k.

(35)

This suggests a picture in which the cascade to larger wavenumbers consists of an evolution
to increasing gradients perpendicular to both the mean ﬁeld direction and the local perturbed
ﬁeld component. This implies rapidly increasing magnetic pressure gradients, but these can
compensated by plasma density ﬂuctuations.

and

The associated velocities fall rapidly, although not exponentially. In terms of one di-
mensional spectra we have a magnetic energy spectrum Eb(k) ∼ k−1, and a kinetic energy
spectrum Ev(k) ∼ k−4. These scaling laws should be compared with Ev ∼ Ek ∼ k−5/3
for the Goldreich-Sridhar predictions for the inviscid regime. The fact that the local mag-
netic perturbations increase, albeit slowly, with increasing wavenumber implies that they
will eventually exceed the strength of the background ﬁeld. Further research should clarify
whether this is a problem.

If we compare this model to the simulations shown in CLV02b and the analysis in Cho,
Lazarian & Vishniac (2003b) we see that the magnetic ﬁeld Fourier power spectrum in the
simulations is slightly steeper than expected, i.e.

while the kinetic energy spectrum shows a stronger deviation

EB(k) ∝ k−1.2 to −1.3,

Ev(k) ∝ k∼−4.5.

The fact that the deviation in the exponent is twice as large for Ev as for EB is consistent

actually ﬂat. The most likely explanation is that since the power spectrum amplitude at a
given k is the Fourier transform of the correlation function, it represents an integration of
the correlation function over all scales r less than ∼ k−1. Since the energy is distributed
logarithmically on all scales between the damping scale and the dissipation scale, this in-
troduces a factor ∼ ln(kmin/k) to EB(k). The simulations have a range ∼ 20 between the
scale of viscous damping and the scale of resistive damping, so this bends the slope of EB(k)
downward by roughly the required amount.

The functional form of φk is somewhat more diﬃcult to test. In CLV03b we constructed
ﬁltered maps of b by separating the b(k) into broad bins. Plotting the cumulative magnetic
energy versus volume for each ﬁltered map gives a measure of the volume ﬁlling fraction
as a function of scale. We show the results in ﬁgure 2 (Fig. 4 in CLV03b). Comparing
the concentration of magnetic energy as a function of scale we see that, as expected, the
concentration of magnetic power increases at smaller scales. Our results may have a slightly
shallower dependence on wavenumber than predicted by equation (38), but this depends on
the value of the cumulative fractional magnetic energy we choose for comparison.

Finally, we note that the eddies in this regime are not described by the linear solutions
to equations (12) and (13). The transfer of magnetic power from large to small scales makes
these solutions largely irrelevant.

2.3. The decoupled, damped regime

As we have seen, ion-neutral decoupling may happen either before or after the turbulent

behavior in the decoupled and damped regime, although the details of the onset of this
stage will diﬀer. We begin by discussing the case where decoupling occurs below the viscous
damping scale, that is, after the cascade has entered the stage described in the preceding
subsection. We will discuss the case of early decoupling, ℵc < 1, in the middle of this
subsection. We will conclude this subsection by describing the termination of the damped
regime and the reappearance of a strong turbulent cascade involving only charged particles.

When ℵc > 1, decoupling occurs as a two step process. First, the pressure support from
the neutral particles becomes ineﬀective and the energy cascade is reduced by a factor of
(Pi/Ptot) ∼ (ni/ntot). At somewhat smaller scales the diﬀerence between the ion and neutral
velocities becomes comparable to vk and the neutrals can be treated as a static background.

We will rely on the same physical arguments used successfully in the previous subsection
to predict this part of the spectrum. Currently numerical simulations address only larger
scales.

The ﬁrst stage of decoupling occurs when the ambipolar diﬀusion rate becomes compara-
c and the neutral particles inﬁltrate the zones of intense magnetic ﬁeld perturbations.

ble to τ −1
This happens at a wavenumber kp given by

where we use the subscript ‘p’ to denote the pressure decoupling scale. Combining this
criterion with equations (32) and (36) we see that

When fn ∼ 1 the streaming of neutrals across the perturbed ﬁeld lines will be accompanied
by signiﬁcant dissipation, so that the turbulent energy cascade is reduced in amplitude by
the factor by which the pressure support is reduced, that is ∼ ρi/ρ. The volume ﬁlling
factor must also drop by this same factor in order to maintain the condition expressed in
equation (35). In our simpliﬁed model we will model the sharp drop in bk and φk at kp as a
discontinuity, although in reality we expect a smooth transition. It is important to note that
there is no associated discontinuity in the rms electron density ﬂuctuations. The volume
averaged strength of the magnetic pressure ﬂuctuations drops by ρi/ρ as the ions go from
providing only a fraction (ρi/ρ) of the compensating plasma pressure to supplying all of it.
The only observational signal may be a change in higher order moments of the scintillation
statistics.

The neutrals and ions decouple entirely when the viscous drag coeﬃcient becomes com-

parable to the neutral drag term in the ion force equation. This sets in when

How is picture modiﬁed when we consider ℵc < 1? The decoupling condition, ℵ ∼ 1,
evaluated to obtain equation (23), is equivalent to the pressure decoupling criterion given
in equation (41) in this case. We see from equation (26) that turbulent motions in the ions
are strongly damped below this limit, so that we are immediately in the damped, pressure
decoupled and dynamically decoupled limit. Consequently, we expect an immediate drop in
φk and bk at the decoupling scale. On smaller scales we can invoke force balance and energy

of the damped turbulence on slightly larger scales and the eddy turnover time of the strong
small scale turbulence, which will start at tin. This suggests that the turbulent cascade will
be driven intermittently, with a buildup of small scale energy followed by its rapid release.
The duty cycle for this process will be approximately the ratio of tin to the eddy turn over

For partially ionized gas in the interstellar medium (see Draine & Lazarian, 1998, for a
discussion of idealized interstellar phases) the collision rate is much less than the ion cyclotron
frequency and the ion Larmor radius is greater than k−1
res. The condition for damping due to
parallel ion viscosity is

kcnli ≥ kkV ∗
k2
A,

(63)

where, as before, V ∗
A is the Alfv´en velocity for the ions alone, and kkli < 1. In the limit where
the plasma is strongly magnetized and ρi ≪ ρn we expect V ∗
A > cn, so that this criterion is
never satisﬁed. That is, damping due to parallel transport is instead given by free-streaming
along the ﬁeld lines, which has an associated damping rate which is always less than the
cascade time scale. We have already noted that the perpendicular ion viscosity is, at most,
only slightly greater than the resistivity. It follows that the turbulent cascade is truncated at
the Larmor radius, when krL ∼ 1. In dense plasmas, like stars and accretion disks, collisions
dominate, ion viscosity is negligible, and the cascade ends at the resistive scale.

2.4. Turbulence in the ISM

Interstellar medium is turbulent with turbulence spreading over a range of scales from
hundreds of parsec (see Lazarian & Pogosyan, 2000; Stanimirovic & Lazarian, 2001) to
astronomical units (see Spangler 1999) As Armstrong, Rickett & Spangler (1997) pointed
out, the fact that interstellar scintillation suggests a power law spectrum consistent with
Kolmogorov turbulence is already a strong indication that the observed scales are connected
by a power cascade. The lack of any feature clearly attributable to neutral particle damping
can be seen as a counter-argument, but the model sketched above implies that it will be
diﬃcult to detect such a feature. For example, although the average neutral fraction in the
diﬀuse ionized medium is uncertain, it probably lies somewhere between a percent and a
few times that. From equation (29) we see that the critical neutral fraction for this gas is
on the order of several percent, depending on the local Mach number, so fnℵc is at most of
order unity. For low Mach numbers one might expect this to translate into an exponential
suppression by a factor of order unity, since the eddy turnover rate will drop with the
amplitude of motions on a given scale, allowing for more eﬀective damping. However, since
the electron density ﬂuctuations will trace the magnetic pressure ﬂuctuations caused by
pseudo-Alfv´en modes within the turbulent cascade, the mean square variance of electron
density on small scales, klarge > kt, will look like an extrapolation of the same quantity from
large scales, ksmall < min[k′, kc], but reduced by a factor of

This will be a very modest reduction. The scintillation power spectrum will look like a fairly
continuous power law from large to small scales, but with a range of intermediate scales
where it goes ﬂat (from kc or k′ to kt) before dropping sharply to an extrapolation of its
large scale behavior. The dynamic range of this ﬂat region will be ∼ (ρn/ρi) max[1, ℵc].
Again, in the diﬀuse ionized medium this will correspond to a factor of order unity (or
less) in length scales, which will not produce an observational signature. The warm neutral
medium should show a more pronounced shoulder in the power spectrum, although given the
heterogeneity of the local interstellar medium, detecting the signal of neutral damping using
electron density ﬂuctuations still represents a challenge. The coldest, and densest, phases of
the ISM have a negligible impact on the scintillation measurements.

In Table 1 we show critical scales and parameters for some idealized phases of the ISM,
taken from Draine & Lazarian (1998). The most obvious point is that the diﬀerent regimes
discussed in this section cover a very modest range of scales. Ignoring the parallel scales,
which may not leave a clear observational signal, the entire range of damped scales covers
only two orders of magnitude in the cold and warm neutral phases of the ISM. For the
bulk of the ISM, the turbulent cascade consists largely of a large scale cascade involving all
the particles, and a smaller scale cascade involving only the ions. (We have not considered
the role of charged grains in this analysis.) Current simulations of strongly damped MHD
turbulence, which apply only to the range between kc and kp, already have more dynamic
range than in the ISM itself. The small wavelength limit on ISM turbulence, set by the
Larmor radius, is only weakly dependent on local conditions.

In magnetically dominated environments, e.g. in molecular clouds, compressibility can
be important. This will extend the range of scales over which the turbulence will lie in the
viscosity damped regime.

3. Reconnection Rates

We are now in a position to rederive the speed of reconnection in turbulent magnetized
plasmas, including the eﬀects of a neutral component. Below we brieﬂy consider highly
ionized plasmas, extending our previous analysis and highlighting steps in our derivation

turbulent plasmas with a small ionized fraction.

3.1. Highly ionized plasmas

For fn < fcrit, as deﬁned in equation (29), the ion-neutral coupling is dynamically
insigniﬁcant on all scales. At suﬃciently small scales a modest fraction of the energy cascade
will go into heating the neutral gas, but given the approximate nature of our discussion we
will ignore the resulting corrections to vk. This limit is equivalent to the fully ionized case,
described in LV99. Here we will brieﬂy review the major results from that paper, since
we need to generalize them in order to calculate reconnection speeds for partially neutral
plasmas.

The basic geometric constraint on reconnection speeds is

Veject,

Vrec =

∆(L)
L
where ∆(L) is the width of the ejection surface for a current sheet of length L. In the absence
of viscosity or neutral friction the ejection speed is ∼ VA. The Sweet-Parker rate comes from
taking ∆ ∼ η/Vrec. In a collisionless plasma ∆ can be ∼ rL, the ion Larmor radius, when
this is larger than the resistive layer. Both of these estimates ignore the role that current
sheet instabilities may play in increasing ∆(L). Here we are principally concerned with
another eﬀect, which is that as the ejected plasma moves out of the reconnection region,
along magnetic ﬁeld lines, the size of ∆(L) will increase as the magnetic ﬁelds lines diﬀuse
away from the current sheet.

(65)

In the presence of noise individual magnetic ﬁeld lines will stay within the current sheet
for some distance, Lmin ≪ L, whose value will depend on the current sheet thickness and the
amplitude of the noise. These individual patches of ﬂux will reconnect at some speed Vrec,local
obtained by substituting Lmin in place of L in equation (65). In the presence of noise, the
current sheet contains many independent ﬂux elements, all reconnecting simultaneously, so
that we have an upper limit on the reconnection speed given by ∼ (L/Lmin)Vrec,local. Since
the geometric constraint on the reconnection speed can be applied on any scale between L
and Lmin this implies

Vrec <

∆(L′)L
(L′)2 Veject(L′),

for all L′ ∈ [Lmin, L],

(66)

where ∆(L′) is the distance ﬁeld lines wander perpendicular to the large scale magnetic ﬁeld
direction within a distance L′ along the ﬁeld lines. For a turbulent cascade the diﬀusion
length ∆ is the solution to

d∆2
dx

= DB(∆)

(67)

where DB deﬁnes the stochastic diﬀusion of ﬁeld lines separated by a distance ∆. Assuming
that the ﬁeld line stochasticity is caused by turbulence in the medium, the functional form

– 25 –

of DB depends on the nature of the turbulence, and is likely to be a function of scale. For
randomly diﬀusing ﬁeld lines this is

DB(∆) ∼ max[

for all k∆ ≥ 1.

(68)

where kk(k) is the parallel wavenumber as a function of the perpendicular wavenumber. In
the presence of strong turbulence this expression is k−2kk(k) ∝ k−4/3. For long wavelength
perturbations, k∆ ≤ 1, there can be a contribution which is reduced from its value at
the scale k−1 by factor (k∆)2. Assuming strong turbulence and taking ∆k ∼ 1 we see
from equations (67) and (68) that we expect ∆ ∝ k−3/2
∼ L′3/2. In other words, the rms
separation of ﬁeld lines should grow as the distance along the direction of the mean ﬁeld to
the 3/2 power. In ﬁgure 3 we plot rms separations for a variety of initial separations in a
2563 cubed hyperviscosity and hyperresistivity simulation. The details of the simulation can
be found in CLV02a. We see that the separation grows as distance along the ﬁeld lines to the
3/2 power, as expected, subject only to a time oﬀset caused by the ﬁnite initial separation.
Also as expected, above the dominant eddy scales the curves roll over into the usual L1/2
law. Independent, but similar, simulations are described in Schekochihin, Maron, Cowley &
McWilliams (2002) who found similar results.

k

In LV99, and here, we are concerned with the eﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld line diﬀusion
on reconnection. However, this same eﬀect removes the suppression of thermal conduction
perpendicular to large scale ﬁeld lines in diﬀuse magnetized plasmas (Narayan & Medvedev
, 2001; Cho et al., 2003; Maron, Chandran & Blackman, 2003; Chandran & Maron, 2003).
This has had a dramatic eﬀect on our understanding of the thermal structure and history of
hot plasmas in galaxy clusters, which has not yet reached a ﬁnal resolution.

For an ionized plasma with negligible viscosity, Veject ∼ VA at all scales. Combining
equations (6), (8), (9), (66) and (68) we ﬁnd that the most restrictive limit on Vrec comes
from L′ ∼ L and gives

In a real ionized plasma the viscosity is not necessarily negligible. When the particle collision
rate is low the perpendicular viscosity will be larger than the resistivity by a factor of several
times the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic ﬁeld pressure. Under relevant astrophysical
circumstances this will be factor of order 10, raising the possibility that viscosity may reduce
magnetic ﬁeld line diﬀusion at scales slightly larger than the scale of resistive dissipation
However, since the strongest constraint comes from the largest scales, this will not aﬀect the
constraint given in equation (69).

– 26 –

The claim that this is an actual estimate of the reconnection speed, rather than an upper
limit, follows from the absence of any other important constraints on reconnection. In this
case the most obvious alternative constraint is that individual ﬂux elements must reconnect
many times after their initial reconnection. If subsequent reconnection events are slow, then
the current sheet will quickly evolve into a tangled mass of reconnected magnetic ﬁeld lines.
If the scale of the current sheet is set by the ion Larmor radius, then this will deﬁne the
scale for all secondary reconnection events, and the small scale reconnection speed will be
∼ VA. The case where resistivity deﬁnes the width of the current sheet is more complicated.
In LV99 we showed that we can consider secondary reconnection events to be similar to
the large scale reconnection, then used a self-similarity argument to show that secondary
reconnection was fast. In either case we ﬁnd that equation (69) is, as advertised, the actual
reconnection speed for ﬁeld lines in turbulent background.

3.2. Partially ionized plasmas

As we have shown in §2, a turbulent cascade in a partially ionized plasma is considerably

on the reconnection speed expressed in equation (66) no longer increases monotonically
with wavenumber, and equation (69) may not be a fair estimate of the reconnection speed.
We need to consider the full range of dynamical regimes, and search for minima in the
reconnection speed limit given by equation (66). This requires estimates for Veject and DB(∆)
over the full range of the turbulent cascade. We have already seen that for k < kc min[1, ℵ3/2
]
the most stringent limit comes from L′ ∼ L, which gives a fairly generous upper limit on the
reconnection speed.

c

We begin by noting that when viscous drag is important, the ejection speed from a

volume of thickness ∆ and length L′ is

Veject ≈

V 2
Aτc
L′ max[(kc∆)2, (fnℵc)−1].

(70)

At large scales, k < kc, the plasma acts as a single ﬂuid and we have Veject ≈ VA. At very small
scales, when the ions are completely uncoupled from the neutrals, we get Veject ≈ VA(ρ/ρi)1/2.

For k > kt a rescaled turbulent cascade emerges. As long as the current sheet thickness
is smaller than k−1, a rescaled version of our previous analysis emerges. In particular, we
expect the most important constraint on the reconnection speed to arise from the smallest
wavenumbers in this regime, k ∼ kt. Due to the intermittent nature of the turbulence we

– 27 –

have a factor ǫ multiplying the usual expression. Using equations (57) and (58) we get

which is always much less than the diﬀusion coeﬃcient associated with the viscous damping
scale. However, since it applies to much smaller scales it still has physical signiﬁcance.

The diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the damped scales is less obvious. The ﬁrst complication is
that since we are interested in the width of the ejection zone, the use of an rms value for
∆ is not obviously correct. The median value would be more appropriate. Since we are not
concerned with constants of order unity here the distinction is unimportant if the distribution
function for ﬁeld line separations is a smooth function with a single peak. Although it is not
obvious that this condition is satisﬁed in the highly intermittent viscously damped regime,
we see from ﬁgure 4 that the median and rms values of ﬁeld lines separation seem to track
one another as a function of distance along the ﬁeld lines. The median is a factor of few
lower.

The second complication is that our model of the viscously damped regime does not
predict the value of DB(k). Since the curvature wavenumber of the ﬁeld lines is constant as
a function of scale, we can estimate the diﬀusion coeﬃcient as

DB(k) ∼

(cid:18)
where lc is the distance a ﬁeld line remains within an intermittent structure and φk is, as
before, the ﬁlling factor of such structures. The value of lc is uncertain, but goes to k−1
k,c
for k = kc, and must fall much more steeply than k−1/3 to be consistent with the sharply
reduced value of DB(k), relative to the undamped case, seen in ﬁgure 3. Based on a simple
geometric picture, we will assume

This implies that

in the damped, viscously coupled regime with ℵc > 1. However, this is also the level of
diﬀusion we would expect from the shear imposed at k = kc. Consequently, the sharp drop
in φk at the scale of pressure decoupling does not aﬀect ﬁeld line diﬀusion. In this regime
the value of ∆ rises exponentially, with a constant L′ ∼ k−1
k,c . We see in ﬁgure 4 that the
simulations are consistent with comparable contributions to the diﬀusion coming from large

– 28 –

and small scales, and with an exponential rise in ∆. The sharpest constraint on Vrec will
come from the minimum ∆ in this regime.

Our claim that lckk,c ≪ 1 is based on the fact that the growth in ﬁeld line separations
is not consistent with the idea that a small fraction of ﬁeld lines diverge sharply from their
neighbors for a distance ∼ k−1
k,c . We can get some idea of the true situation by considering the
full distribution of ﬁeld line separations, given in ﬁgure 5. We see that while the separations
certainly do not show a gaussian distribution, they do show that ﬁeld lines join the growing
tail of large separations at a distance which is typically shorter than k−1
k,c .

Equations (72) and (73) imply that for k > kd the diﬀusion coeﬃcient will go to a
constant value, which persists until k = kt and φk = 1. In this regime, kd < k < kt, we can
use equation (57) and ﬁnd

However, this value is only relevant when, for some k > kd, it is greater than the contribution
from the large scale shear given by ∼ kk,c∆2 (for ℵc > 1) or ∼ k′
k∆2 (for ℵc < 1). Once
this value of DB applies we get ∆ ∝ L′1/2 and the limit on Vrec will increase with k. The

4. Reconnection in Various Phases of ISM

All common phases of the ISM are strongly collisionless, so that ambipolar damping
has a reasonable chance of changing the turbulent power spectrum and consequently the
stochastic reconnection speed. The ISM is extremely heterogeneous, but we can illustrate
the eﬀects of turbulence using the same idealized phases from Draine & Lazarian (1998).
We have evaluated the reconnection speed using equations (22) and (82) for each phase.
Our results are given in the second to last line of Table 1, and we give a detailed discussion
below. (The last line includes the eﬀects of tearing modes, which appear to dominate in the
densest parts of molecular clouds). The turbulence which creates ﬁeld line stochasticity is
assumed to be supplied at some large scale, speciﬁed below, so we are implicitly ignoring
the possibility that as reconnection proceeds it will provide a local source of turbulence6 We
have also ignored the possibility that reconnection can change the ionization balance near
the current sheet.

We see from an inspection of Table 1 that neutral drag produces a limit on the reconnec-
tion speed which is usually more restrictive than the limit given at L′ = L, that is, the limit

6The increase of stochasticity due to reconnection may be the source of the ﬁnite time instability associated

with solar ﬂares (Lazarian & Vishniac, 1999; Vishniac & Lazarian, 2000).

– 30 –

which applies to an ionized plasma. The only exception is the warm ionized medium, where
the neutral content is ∼ 1% and the turbulent cascade continues down to rL. Assuming
strong turbulence, with a Mach number of order unity, the reduction in the reconnection
speed from the ionized limit is only a factor of ∼ 10 for neutral atomic gas. This is mod-
erately sensitive to the scale of turbulent energy injection, but since we expect that L ∼ l
this will not be large eﬀect. On the other hand, strongly subsonic turbulence implies a much
smaller limit on Vrec. Quiescent regions in the ISM should have reconnection speeds much
smaller than the local Alfv´en speed.

Molecular gas occupies only a small fraction of the ISM’s volume, but plays a special
role as the site of star formation. Table 1 indicates that as we consider increasingly dense
molecular gas, we move towards the case of decoupling above the viscous damping scale.
In this limit the reconnection speed becomes more sensitive to the energy injection scale.
We have assumed a single (large) scale here, but it may be that a much smaller value is
appropriate in small dense regions. In that case the limit on the reconnection speed would
drop signiﬁcantly. However, if the density increases to the point where resistive instabilities
produce current sheets substantially broader than the width given in equation (76) then
the limit on the reconnection speed will once again increase. This accounts for the double
entry for molecular clouds. Following the approach used in other phases we get that the
reconnection speed is lower than the Alfv´en speed, even for a Mach number of 1, by more
than an order magnitude. Unlike the atomic phases, this result scales as the square root of the
turbulent velocity, so that weaker turbulence has a less dramatic eﬀect on the reconnection
speed. However, this result can be a substantial underestimate. A large scale current sheet
is unstable to tearing modes (Furth, Killeen, & Rosenbluth (1963)), and these provide a
localized source of turbulence which will broaden the current sheet. This sets a minimum
value of the current sheet width. The resulting limit on Vrec takes precedence when it gives
a larger ∆, and a larger Vrec, than estimates based purely on the turbulent cascade.

We show the eﬀect of tearing modes in the last line of Table 1. For ℵc < 1, for example,

in the dense cores of molecular clouds, we can take the parallel correlation scale as

Consequently the resistivity for DC phase of the ISM is approximately 9.3 × 109 cm2 sec−1.
Combining these results we obtain the last entry of Table 1. The large coeﬃcient implies
that the usual large scale limit, given in equation (69), will usually apply here. In the densest
and most neutral phases of the ISM we recover the fast reconnection speeds typical of an
ionized plasma.

5. Conclusions

Our results can be summarized as follows:

1. In plasmas characterized by a moderate magnetic Prandtl number (resistivity less than,
or of order, viscosity) magnetic reconnection follows the model described in LV99, so
that reconnection is fast in the presence of noise. Collisionless plasmas with small
In
neutral fractions and collisionally dominated plasmas are typically in this class.
either case the turbulent cascade proceeds to either the resistive scale or the ion Larmor
radius. For typical interstellar conditions, it is the ion Larmor radius which is larger.

2. As the neutral content in plasma increases the turbulent cascade is interrupted at
a scale greater than the neutral mean free path. However, the magnetic ﬁeld per-
turbations are not suppressed below this scale. On the contrary, we ﬁnd that the
magnetic ﬁeld power spectrum ﬂattens out, and exhibits more power on small scales
than the Goldreich-Sridhar spectrum. Velocity ﬂuctuations in this regime are driven
by magnetic ﬁeld perturbations, whose energy is much larger than the kinetic energy
perturbations on the same scale. The importance of this new regime of magnetic
stochasticity goes far beyond understanding the reconnection problem.

3. On somewhat smaller scales, once the ions and neutrals are decoupled, the turbulent
cascade can reappear. The warm atomic gas in the ISM shows only a slight interruption
in the turbulent cascade and the small scale scintillations are close to a continuation
of the large scale power. However, this break will be more conspicuous in colder and
denser phases of the ISM. In this limit the small scale turbulence will be strongly
intermittent.

4. Magnetic stochasticity on scales smaller than the ion-neutral damping cut-oﬀ of the
Goldreich-Sridhar spectrum promotes fast reconnection. The diﬀusion of magnetic
ﬁeld lines initially decreases rapidly below this scale, but the decoupling of ions and
neutrals leads to a minimum value of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient on small scales. The
most stringent limit on reconnection speeds comes from considering the largest scales
where this minimum value holds. This is in the range of the turbulent cascade where

– 33 –

ions and neutrals are decoupled, but neutral drag is still suﬃcient to stabilize magnetic
perturbations. In most phases of the ISM this gives a reconnection speed which is just
slightly smaller than the ionized plasma estimate given in LV99.

5. Our study shows that the reconnection speed in the ISM is always much faster than the
predictions given by the Sweet-Parker rate. Even in very dense and cold regions it is
only slightly below the Alfv´en speed, and tearing mode instabilities in the current sheet
tend to drive it back up to the Alfv´en speed. This process needs to be considered in
models for magnetic ﬂux removal during star formation, and for studies of the dynamics
of magnetized molecular clouds.

Finally, we note that our conclusions are moderately sensitive to the nature of ﬁeld line
diﬀusivity in the various damped regimes (kt < k < min[k′, kc]). We have argued that the
shearing due to motions at k ∼ kc dominate until we are well into the decoupled damped
regime. Our estimate for a constant ﬁeld line diﬀusivity on somewhat smaller scales has
not been tested against simulations.
If this turns out to be too high (or low) then our
reconnection speed estimate will have to be lowered (or raised).

A. Tearing Modes and Current Sheet Width

The current sheet implicit in the Sweet-Parker picture of magnetic reconnection is well
known to be unstable to tearing modes (Furth, Killeen, & Rosenbluth, 1963), which will
create a turbulent zone between the volumes of unreconnected magnetic ﬂux. In LV99 we
suggested that the broadening of the current sheet implied by this eﬀect should lead to an
enhanced reconnection rate for laminar ﬁeld lines, on the order of

This determines the width of the outﬂow zone if we can assume that the tearing modes
produce stochastic mixing of the ﬁeld lines, that is, that neighboring ﬁeld lines are well-mixed
within this volume. In two dimensions this is obviously not the case. In three dimensions
it is probably valid. We are also assuming that the existence of turbulence in the current
sheet does not lead to widespread mixing of ﬁeld lines outside the current sheet. Although
some mixing seems inevitable, the fact that the modes are driven only as long as they are
narrow enough to ﬁt within the current sheet, and grow only about as fast as plasma, and
magnetic structures, are ejected from the current sheet, suggests that any induced ﬁeld line
mixing will only spread the the outﬂow zone by an additional factor of order unity.

When the ions and neutrals are not decoupled, but viscous drag plays an important role

we can rewrite equation (A2) as

A, FM is the (approximate) mass fraction contained in
each phase, and a subscript ‘30’ indicates that distances are given in units of 30 parsecs. The second row gives the ionization
fraction for each phase. The abbreviations in the ﬁrst row denote ‘Warm Ionized Medium’, ‘Warm Neutral Medium’, ‘Cold
Neutral Medium’, ‘Molecular Cloud’, and ‘Dense Core’ (in a molecular cloud). Length scales are deﬁned in the text and are
given here in centimeters.

bulence, as a function of distance parallel to the mean magnetic ﬁeld, for a range of initial

remove pseudo-Alfv´en modes, which introduce noise into the diﬀusion calculation.

(a) we see the total result. In (b) we have removed long wavelength modes. In (c) we retain
only the long wavelength modes. In all three cases the median tracks the mean, at a slightly
smaller amplitude, and is consistent with exponential growth. The simulation used a 3843

large fraction of all ﬁeld lines despite the intermittency of the magnetic ﬁeld perturbations.

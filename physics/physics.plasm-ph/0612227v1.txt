Abstract

The extraordinary ability of space-charge waves in plasmas to accelerate charged particles at gra-

dients that are orders of magnitude greater than in current accelerators has been well documented.

We develop a phenomenological framework for Laser WakeField Acceleration (LWFA) in the 3D

nonlinear regime, in which the plasma electrons are expelled by the radiation pressure of a short

pulse laser, leading to nearly complete blowout. Our theory provides a recipe for designing a LWFA

for given laser and plasma parameters and estimates the number and the energy of the accelerated

electrons whether self-injected or externally injected. These formulas apply for self-guided as well

as externally guided pulses (e.g. by plasma channels). We demonstrate our results by presenting

a sample Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation of a 30f sec, 200T W laser interacting with a 0.75cm

long plasma with density 1.5

1018cm−

3 to produce an ultra-short (10f s) mono-energetic bunch

×

of self-injected electrons at 1.5 GeV with 0.3nC of charge. For future higher-energy accelerator

applications we propose a parameter space, that is distinct from that described by Gordienko and

Pukhov [Physics of Plasmas 12, 043109 (2005)] in that it involves lower densities and wider spot

sizes while keeping the intensity relatively constant. We ﬁnd that this helps increase the output

electron beam energy while keeping the eﬃciency high.

In plasma based acceleration a laser or particle beam creates a plasma wave wakeﬁeld

with a phase velocity close to the speed of light, c.

[1, 2]. The acceleration gradients in

these wakeﬁelds can easily exceed 10 GeV/m which is nearly three orders of magnitude

larger than that achieved in conventional RF technology. A particle injected in such a wave

with suﬃcient initial energy can interact with the longitudinal component of the electric

ﬁeld for a long enough time, that its energy gain is signiﬁcant.

An intense laser pulse or electron beam can expel the plasma electrons outward to create

a bare ion column [3, 4] which has ideal accelerating and focusing properties for electron

beams [4]. A recent important development in this ﬁeld has been the simulation and exper-

imental observations of these highly-nonlinear 3D wakeﬁeld structures and the acceleration

of electrons [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In the laser-driven cases they were shown to generate quasi-

monoenergetic beams of electrons with energies on the order of 100 MeV [7, 8, 9]. In these

experiments, the energetic electron generation mechanism involves an interplay of complex

phenomena, namely: the evolution of the laser, the self-trapping of electrons and their

inﬂuence on the wake.

In this article, we describe how to extend the results from the recent experiments towards

a more stable regime conducive to making an accelerator. We will show that by using near

term lasers in the 0.1 to 3P W range it will be possible to generate of 1

13GeV mono-

−

energetic electron beams with nC of charge in a single stage without the need for external

guiding. Using external guiding energies up to 120GeV can be achieved in a single stage for

a 3P W laser. Unlike in the recent experiments, this regime is characterized by lasers whose

intensity and spot size are matched and by relatively low plasma densities. The matched laser

proﬁle (both transverse and longitudiunal) evolves little during the acceleration distance

which greatly exceeds the Rayleigh length.

We are motivated to determine a path towards making a compact electron accelerator

based on the LWFA concept for use in high energy physics or as a light source. Eﬃciency and

beam quality are key issues one should keep in mind when making such designs. As shown

by Katsouleas et al.[11], in order to achieve suﬃcient beam loading eﬃciency (from wake to

particles) and to reduce the beam emittance growth, the spot size of the wake (hence laser)

should be less than a plasma skindepth. In addition, in order to most eﬃciently transfer

the laser energy to the wake over the entire eﬀective accelerating distance (pump depletion

length matching dephasing length), the laser normalized vector potential (laser intensity)

3

must be larger than unity. These two conditions are based on linear theory, however, taken

together they imply that LWFA needs to be operated in a 3D nonlinear regime, in which

the laser power exceeds the critical power for relativistic self-focusing[3].

It was shown by Sun et al. [3] that for intense and narrow lasers the transverse pondero-

motive force can lead to complete electron blowout (cavitation) when the laser power slightly

exceeds the critical power for relativistic self-focusing,Pc, and the laser is focused tightly.

This analysis was done for long pulses (although it assumed the ions were ﬁxed). Mora

and Antonsen [12] showed in reduced PIC simulation that cavitation could occur for power
2√a0c/ωp, where a0 = eALaser/(mc2)
above Pc. When using ultra-short pulses, cτ . w0 ≃
for a linearly polarized laser and w0 the laser spot size, the ions are indeed stationary, and

a region nearly void of electrons (ion channel) is generated behind the laser pulse. This

channel exerts an attractive Coulomb force on the blown-out electrons causing them to rush

back toward the axis thereby exciting a wakeﬁeld. In 1991 Rosenzweig et al. [4] showed that

wakes excited in this nonlinear blowout regime (they used a particle beam driver) had ideal

focusing and accelerating properties. Very soon thereafter it was shown using 2D simulations

that similar wakes could be made by lasers [13].

In 2002 Puhkov and Meyer-ter-vehn used 3D particle-in-cell simulations of LWFA at very

high laser intensities and plasma densities without external guiding and found that electrons

were self-injected in the blowout regime and that they formed a quasi mono-energetic beam

as they were accelerated [5]. In their simulations the blowout cavity formed a sphere leading

them to subsequently call this the “bubble” regime for LWFA [14]. Recently, a theoretical

analysis [15, 16] showed that for suﬃciently intense and ultra-short lasers, a0 & 4, the

resulting electron density structure will resemble a spherical cavity and it was shown that

the laser spot size needed to be matched to the maximum blowout (bubble) radius in order

to achieve the most ideal wakes. It is worth noting for 2 . a0 . 4 electron blowout still

occurs with the cavity slightly deviating from a spherical shape.

The recent experimental results are promising but they still rely on substantial evolution

of the laser and the energy spread and emittances are not suﬃcient for high-energy physics

applications. What paths are available for extending these experiments towards higher

energies with more control using the “bubble” regime? The original simulation results on the

“bubble” regime in ref. [5] were based on a simulation of a 360T W laser propagating through

a 0.01 critical density (1.74

1019cm−

3 for λ = 0.8µm) plasma. Do the key features of this

×

4

simulation remain for diﬀerent laser powers, pulse lengths, spot sizes, and plasma densities?

Answering these questions is diﬃcult because the inherent physics is highly nonlinear.

One approach was put forth by Gordienko and Puhkov (GP) [17]. They argued that

for a0 >> 1 the speed of all plasma electrons is very close to the speed of light and under

this condition all quantities will scale with a single similarity parameter, S

np
nca0 , to
some power. The coeﬃcients in front of the scalings are determined from simulations (or

≡

experiments). The resulting expressions are therefore only strictly valid so long as the

laser’s transverse and longitudinal proﬁle, aspect ratio etc.

remain the same. Another

approach presented here is to use a phenomenological description. We identify the important

physics as wake excitation (amplitude and phase velocity), pump depletion (pulse evolution),

dephasing (between particles and wake), and beam loading. We use these concepts to develop

expressions for predicting the number of electrons, the electron energy, and overall eﬃciency.

For any useful accelerator, the accelerating structure’s (wake) amplitude, wavelength, and

phase velocity need to be reasonably stable during the entire acceleration process. We show

that a stable wake can be excited in the blowout regime when the laser’s spot size is roughly

matched to the blowout radius. We also show that under these conditions expressions for

the wake amplitude and phase velocity (dephasing length), the laser pump depletion length,

and the number of accelerated electrons can then be obtained including their coeﬃcients

based on simple physics arguments and previously published ideas.

Importantly, unlike

when using a similarity theory, the coeﬃcients derived from the phenomenological theory

can be extended to propagation in plasma channels as well to when an external beam of

electrons is injected.

We will show that while there is overlap in the ideas put forth here and by GP there are

also profound diﬀerences besides those just described. Their analysis can only be valid when

a0 & 2

nc/np while ours is for a0 & 2. Their supporting simulations used a0 = 20

80

(for each direction of a circularly polarized laser which is the same as 28

113 for a linearly

p

polarized laser) and n/nc = 0.02

0.08. Their analysis appears to ignore dephasing leading

−

to diﬀerent scaling laws. We will show that in contrast to the work of GP, our expressions

−

advocate using lower a0 and lower densities. In fact, we will argue that in order to obtain

controlled acceleration one should operate with an a0 too low for the key assumption in the

theory of GP to even apply. Despite these diﬀerences we borrow the term “bubble” from

ref. [14] to describe the near spherical ion channel behind the laser pulse.

5

To verify our results, we have carried out many computer experiments using the 3D,

particle-in-cell code OSIRIS [18], that explore a wide range of plasma densities, laser powers,

and spot sizes (see later). We highlight one simulation that is very relevant to near term

experiments. Details of the simulation parameters and setup are provided in the Appendix.

In this simulation, a 30f s (FWHM) 0.8µm laser pulse containing 200 TW of power is focused

to a spot size w0 = 19.5µm at the entrance of a 1.5

1018cm−

3 density plasma to give a

×

normalized vector potential of a0 = 4. The laser is circularly polarized (with normalized

vector potential 4/√2 in each direction) and has a Gaussian transverse proﬁle. The plasma

is 0.75cm long which corresponds to more than 5 Rayleigh lengths.

We next develop a phenomenological theory for LWFA in the blowout regime. A light

pulse can be guided with a nearly constant (matched) spot size by a plasma channel that has

a parabolic refractive index/density proﬁle with a maximum/minimum on axis. The index of

p[GW ] is the critical power for relativistic self focusing [3].

Unfortunately, even when P & Pc and the spotsize is suﬃciently small, the index of

refraction needs a distance on the order of c/ωp to build up. Therefore, it is often thought

that a short pulse laser τ . 1/ωp cannot be self-guided and some form of external optical

guiding is needed [19]. However, as described in ref.

[21] for P/Pc >> 1 a degree of self-

guiding for short pulses is possible because the leading edge of the laser locally pump depletes

before it diﬀracts and the back of the pulse is still guided in the ion column region. In case

of external optical guiding P/Pc >> 1 is not necessary, instead P/Pc & 1 can be used which

also leads to clear blowout.

The stable self-guiding of an intense short pulse is illustrated in ﬁgure 1. We ﬁnd that for

self-guided propagation of the laser beam, without signiﬁcant variations of the pulse proﬁle

over the interaction distance, its spot size and intensity must be appropriately chosen. A

6

rigorous derivation for the matched spot size and the laser proﬁle is not currently available.

Still, as noted in ref.[3, 14, 15] the requirements for a matched proﬁle can be estimated by
assuming that the transverse ponderomotive force of the laser kp∇
R is the blowout radius, is roughly balanced by the force of the ion channel Er ∼
pulls back the ponderomotively expelled electrons. Equating these two expressions yields
√a0. Furthermore, the blowout radius scales with the laser spot size, kpw0 ∼

For the energy gain we may write the obvious equation

∆E = qELW Lacc = ǫLW laccmc2

(5)

where ELW is the average accelerating ﬁeld of the beam loaded wake, Lacc is the acceleration
length, ǫLW ≡
dephasing length, so we impose the condition Letch > Ld ⇒
too short dephasing will not be reached, and the electron beam may have signiﬁcant energy

eELW /(mcωp) and lacc = ωpLacc/c. The desired acceleration length is the

cτF W HM > 2R/3. If the pulse is

spread. We note that this condition is approximate, since the laser starts diﬀracting as

soon as its intensity is insuﬃcient to sustain self focusing and this happens before the pulse

is completely pump depleted. Additionally the injected particles need to slightly pass the

dephasing point (phase space rotation) so that the energy spread is minimum. On the other

hand, the length of the pulse should not be too large, because the laser ﬁeld could interact

with the trapped electrons and degrade the beam quality.

We need an expression for ǫLW which is the average accelerating ﬁeld experienced by an

electron,

. In ref.

[15] it was shown that for a0 & 4 the ion column formed a sphere

Ezi

and that the accelerating ﬁeld, for the most part, depends linearly on the distance from the

middle of the sphere (ﬁgure 2(a)). This is conﬁrmed in ﬁgures 1(a)-(c) where a bubble void

of electrons roughly forms a circle and in ﬁgures 2(a),(b) where a lineout of eEz/(mcωp)

along the axis is shown. We also found by theory and 3D PIC simulations that a spherical

shape is still roughly formed for 2 . a0 . 4 with matched laser proﬁles.

Interestingly,

although the physics is very diﬀerent, the nonlinear wakes formed in 1D also exhibit a linear

slope of the same amount.

Because the bubble is roughly a sphere and the electrons are either self or externally

injected at the rear, the electrons then travel a relative distance R before they dephase. The

peak useful accelerating ﬁeld is eEz,max/(mcωp) = √a0 and because the wakeﬁeld is roughly
linear, the average ﬁeld is half of the peak: ǫLW ≡
therefore write the approximate equation for the energy gain:

than on the input laser power. However, when the plasma density is lowered for ﬁxed power,

ensuring self-guided propagation of the leading edge of the laser is more challenging. This

can be accomplished by plasma channels or to some degree by self-guiding. As we argue

later, for self-guiding to occur P/Pc needs to increase as the plasma density decreases. We

can rewrite equation (6) in terms of the critical power for relativistic self-focusing, Pc:

On the other hand, if a plasma channel is used, P/Pc can be kept as low as 1. As shown
before, the channel depth ∆nc/np needed is 4/(kpw0)2

1/a0. So as long as a0 & 2 is used,

≃

the normalized channel depth is small (less than 0.5). It is also worth noting here that when

a channel is used, the channel parameters (width and depth) should be chosen based on the

matching condition for given laser power and plasma density (Eqs. 1 and 2) so that leading

front of the laser is guided by the density channel and the back of the laser is guided by the

(6)

(7)

matched ion channel.

The electron beam surﬁng on the wake can be either self-injected as shown in our sample

simulation (ﬁgure 1(b)) or externally injected from some other source. For self-injection,

particles in the rear of the blowout region must be able to catch up with the wake. The

physical condition for this to happen is twofold: ﬁrst, the blowout radius should be large

enough so that when the particles reach the rear of the bubble, they move predominately

in the forward direction with speed close to the speed of light. Second, at the rear portion

of the ion channel, trajectory crossing occurs leading to a narrow sheath with the highest

accelerating and focusing ﬁelds. Therefore, even though electrons initially have a γ (energy)

substantially below the wake’s Lorentz factor γφ, they can easily achieve suﬃcient energy as

they are accelerated while they slowly drift backwards (relatively to the pulse) in the sheath.

In our sample simulation, the eﬀective γ of the wake is around 20 and the normalized blowout

9

radius is around 4. The initial energy γ of those trapped electrons is substantially smaller

than 20. For even lower plasma densites, we have performed a number of simulations, where

an electron beam with γ exceeding 10000 was used as the driver instead of a laser and we

observed self-injected electrons in each case for a normalized blowout radius around 5. This

indicates that for laser wavelengths in the 0.8µm range and plasma densities of interest,

self-injection will always happen when we keep the normalized blowout radius around 4

5.

∼

This diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the claim in ref.

[14] that √a0 > γφ, or a0 > 400 for our

sample simulation, for self-trapping to occur.

In the regime presented here the self-injected electron bunches are highly localized in

space with a half-width of the ﬁrst bunch of only

10f s, i.e. 1c/ωp. Once a suﬃcient

∼

number of electrons have been trapped the trapping process terminates, as seen in ﬁgure

1(c). The ﬁrst electron bunch reaches an energy of 1.5 GeV and its energy spectrum is

presented in ﬁgure 2(c). The normalized emittances are shown in ﬁgure 3. They may be

estimated as the product of the beam spot size, which roughly scales with 1/√np, with the

spread in the momentum perpendicular to the acceleration direction, which scales with the

relativistic ponderomotive potential (

a0). These simple considerations show that as we

∼

move to lower densities in order to achieve higher energy particles the emmitances of the

self-injected electrons will increase. This suggests that for the electron beam to be useful

for high energy physics or light source, external injection may be more attractive. As an

interesting aside, simulations also reveal the trapping and acceleration of a second distinct

bunch in the second bucket (see ﬁgure 2(c)), which has a lower energy because the average

electric ﬁeld it experiences is smaller.

The number, N, of electrons that are accelerated can be estimated from energy balance.

Hence we examine the partition of ﬁeld and particle energy within the ﬁrst bucket. The

ﬁelds inside the ion column have Ez, Er, and Bφ components. In addition there is kinetic

energy in the plasma. In a 3D linear or 1D nonlinear wake the ﬁelds and kinetic energy scale

together. This is not the case for these 3D nonlinear wakes where an increasing percentage of

energy ends up in electrons which are blown out well beyond the narrow electron sheath for

higher laser intensity. Integrating the ﬁeld energy in the ion channel we ﬁnd equipartition

between the energy in the longitudinal ﬁeld

The trailing particles can recover the ﬁeld energy in the ion channel and the kinetic

energy in the narrow electron sheath by changing the shape of the ion channel. The kinetic

energy in the narrow electron sheath scales the same way as the ﬁeld energy. By equating 2

with the energy absorbed by N particles that travel across the ion channel (we assume the

average ﬁeld felt by these particle is Ez,max/2 and the kinetic energy in the electron sheath

a 200T W , 0.8µm pulse equation (10) predicts 0.6nC of charge. The charge measured from

the simulation for the ﬁrst bunch is 0.3nC. We have also veriﬁed these scaling laws by

monitoring how many electrons can be externally injected before the wake becomes severely

loaded.

As shown in ﬁgure 1(d), the acceleration process stops before the accelerating bunch de-

phases. This will not lead to any considerable modiﬁcations of the aforementioned formulas,

particularly because the pump depletion length scales as the dephasing distance and the

accelerating wakeﬁeld decreases as the trapped electrons approach the center of the sphere.

The beam energy seen in the simulation, 1.5 GeV, is close to that calculated theoretically

from Eq. (6) which is (6)

Lpd which is in agreement with our observation that pump depletion happened

before dephasing. In addition, as the laser pump depleted its rate of diﬀraction increased

such that the eﬀective acceleration length was eventually limited by diﬀraction to a distance

0.75cm which was less than the pump depletion distance 0.96cm. For a wake with a linear

slope most of the energy gain occurs near the peak ﬁeld. This combined with the density

11

spike at the back of the bucket is why the estimate from eq. (6) is still so accurate for this

non-optimized sample simulation.

In spite of the complexity of the physics associated with this interaction, the predictions

by the simple formulas presented in this article are very close to 3D PIC simulation results.

Good agreement is also achieved between these scaling laws and recent experimental results

[7, 8, 9] despite the fact that the laser powers were slightly below the “threshold” for the

blowout regime and the laser pulse was not matched transversely nor longitudinally. To be

in the regime identiﬁed by a spherical bubble, one needs a0 & 4 or equivalently P/Pc & 8 and

cτ < 2√a0c/ωp which leads to the condition that P & 30(τ /30f s)T W . These conditions

can be relaxed for channel-guided lasers for which P/Pc may be smaller. It is then written

as a0 & 2 or P/Pc & 1. We present the comparison between the scaling law for the energy

Eq. (6) and the aforementioned results in ﬁgure 4.

The scalings derived above and the underlying physics predict that it is advantageous to

use moderate intensities and very low plasma densities to increase the output energy and

keep the eﬃciency high. The simulations also show that the injection process can be clamped

and the energy spread of the electron beam is much less in the regime we are proposing,

which indicates that this regime is also amenable to accelerating externally injected beams

while maintaining good beam quality.

In table I we compare some of our results to previously published work [17, 19]. Both

linear and 1D nonlinear formulas fail to describe the 3D nonlinear regime in nearly all

respects.

It is however instructive to compare the scaling laws described above against

those obtained in ref.[17] using a similarity theory for the high intensity high plasma density

regime, because in ref. [17] the scaling (but not the coeﬃcients) of the ﬁelds in the bubble

and the laser spotsize with a0 were identiﬁed correctly. The key assumption of ref.[17]

required that a0 >> 1. For the energy gain, they obtained

TABLE I: This table compares formulas and scalings from linear theory, 1D nonlinear theory, the

similarity theory of reference 16 and the 3D phenomenological nonlinear theory in this paper. The

column labeled a0 shows the range of a0 that each theory is intended for. kpw0 from linear and

1d nonlinear theory is kept constant while in both our theory and theory of ref. [17]. kpw0 scales

with the blowout radius. The acceleration length is limited by dephasing in linear theory and our

3D nonlinear theory, while it is limited by pump depletion in 1D nonlinear theory and the work of

GP. (Note that in standard 1D nonlinear theory the phase velocity of the wake is incorrectly set

equal to the nonlinear group velocity) Only in our 3D nonlinear theory do dephasing and pump

depletion scale the same way (if the pulse length is matched to the bubble size). The dephasing

length is evidently ignored in ref.

[17] so the energy gain depends on the pulse length. Linear

dephasing and 1d nonlinear dephasing both scale diﬀerently than in the 3d nonlinear regime. The

pump depletion length from 1d nonlinear theory scales as in 3d nonlinear theory but for diﬀerent

physics reasons. In 1D all the laser energy goes into the wake while in our 3D theory this is not

the case. We discuss the pump depletion length from ref. [17] extensively in the text. Both linear

and 1d nonlinear theory incorrectly identify the plasma wavelength and wake phase velocity. The

resulting energy scalings are diﬀerent. If one sets ωpτ

√a0 in ref. [17] then the energy scales as

∼

a2
0. Therefore linear, 1D nonlinear and the similarity theory of ref. [17] all give identical scalings

for the ∆W with both intensity and density while our results give ∆ scaling as a0 to the ﬁrst

power.

We point out the stronger dependence of the energy on the power in these formulas. The

diﬀerence between the scaling laws presented here and those from similarity theory lie in

the scaling for Lacc. We have argued that Lacc is limited because the pulse pump depletes

primarily by giving kinetic energy to the electrons. An electron at the front of the laser is

pushed forward and to the side. As argued in ref.

[21] each electron gains an amount of

pump depletion enhances the etching velocity independently of laser intensity. However, for

extremely large a0 electrons can move forward with a velocity greater than the velocity of the

leading edge of the pulse; which is at most the linear group velocity because the nonlinearity

does not develop instantaneously. Equating the forward going velocity of a single electron

to the linear group velocity gives an estimate for a critical value for the laser amplitude,

same scaling for the particle energy as obtained from similarity theory. However, even for

this high intensity limit dephasing will still occur because the leading edge cannot move

faster than the linear group velocity of the highest frequency component, since at the very

front the amplitude is small [22].

Last, it is useful to extrapolate the bubble regime for moderate a0 to 10GeV and beyond.

If we keep P/Pc ﬁxed, then the laser power and inverse of the density scale with the desired

electron energy and the pulse length will scale as the electron energy to the 1/2 power. If

we scale up our sample simulation, to obtain 15GeV we need a 2P W , 100f s laser and a

plasma with density of 1.5

is beyond current capabilities. However, we have carried out a 3D PIC simulation for a short

propagation distance to verify that electrons will still be self-injected. Results are shown in

ﬁgure 5.

If both the technology for making meter scale (0.1m

FIG. 1: A sequence of 2-dimensional slices (x

z) reveals the evolution of the accelerating structure

−

(electron density, blue) and the laser pulse (orange). Each plot is a rectangular of size z = 101.7µm

(longitudinal direction, z) and x = 129.3µm (transverse direction, x). A broken white circle is

superimposed on each plot to show the shape of the blown-out region. When the front of the laser

has propagated a distance, (a) z = 0.3mm the matched laser pulse has clearly excited a wakeﬁeld.

Apart from some local modiﬁcation due to beam loading eﬀects, as seen in (b) this wakeﬁeld

remains robust even as the laser beam propagates though the plasma a distance of 7.5mm (as seen

in (c) and (d)) or 5 Rayleigh lenghts. After the laser beam has propagated 2mm (as seen in (b))

into the plasma, one can clearly see self-trapped electrons in the ﬁrst accelerating bucket. The

radial and longitudinal localization of the self-trapped bunch is evident in part (c). After 7.5mm

the acceleration process terminates as the depleted laser pulse starts diﬀracting.

18

FIG. 2: (a) A lineout of the wakeﬁeld along the z axis after 0.3mm shows that within the ﬁrst bucket

the slope of the wakeﬁeld is nearly constant and equal to eEz/(mcωp)

ξ/2 where ξ = (kp(ct

z)).

After 5.7mm of propagation (b) the wakeﬁeld has been modiﬁed by beam loading (ﬂattening of

the wake between 400

450c/ωp). This is corroborated by the pz vx z plot that is superimposed

−

on the lineout of the wakeﬁeld. Pictures (a) and (b) reveal that the acceleration mechanism is

extremely stable during the simulation. The energy spectrum after 7.5mm (c) exhibits an isolated

spike of 0.3nC at 1.5GeV with energy spread ∆γ/γ = 3.8% corresponding to the ﬁrst bucket and

a second spike of 50pC at 700M eV with energy spread ∆γ/γ = 1.5% corresponding to the second

bucket.

black points correspond to: (a) experiment [7], (b) experiment [8] which uses a channel for guiding,

(c) experiment and 3D PIC simulation [9], (d) 3D PIC simulation [6] which uses a channel for

guiding, (e) A 3D PIC simulation in [5], (f) 3D PIC simulation presented in this article. Each of

these points is very close to one of the blue lines indicating agreement with our scaling law.

FIG. 5: Picture (a) shows the laser electric ﬁeld with orange on top of the electron density with

blue after 0.4mm of propagation. The laser front is chosen sharper than the back because it has

been found through simulations that this leads to more stable propagation. The blowout region is

well formed. Picture (b) shows that particles at the rear of the ion channel have already reached

velocities higher than the laser velocity and therefore are trapped. The region in z direction plotted

in picture (b) corresponds to the z region between the broken lines in picture (a).

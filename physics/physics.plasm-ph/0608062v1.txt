Abstract

We report on the observations of persistent long-range ordered structures in the central 40Ca+ ion

component of 40Ca+–44Ca+ two-species ion Coulomb crystals in a linear Paul trap. The lifetimes of

structures consisting of a few thousand ions are several seconds, or at least an order of magnitude

longer than observed in similar size single component systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 103001 (2006)].

Molecular dynamics simulations strongly indicate that the observed structures are induced by the

radio frequency quadrupole trapping ﬁeld.

A solid state of an one-component plasma (OCP), often referred to as a Wigner crystal

or a Coulomb crystal, appears whenever the coupling parameter Γ = ECoul/Ekin, where

ECoul is the nearest neighboring Coulomb potential energy and Ekin is the averaged kinetic

energy of the particles, exceeds

200 [1, 2, 3]. In recent decades, such crystals have been

∼

investigated experimentally in a large variety of physical systems [4, 5, 6, 7]. In particular,

laser-cooled and trapped atomic ions have proven to be an excellent system for experimental

studies of Coulomb crystals under various conﬁnement conditions. Single-species, one-, two-

and three-dimensional ion Coulomb crystals have been investigated in Penning and radio

frequency (rf) traps (also named Paul traps), with structural ﬁndings in good agreement

with theoretical predictions [4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Two-species crystals have been studied

in much less detail, and experimentally mainly in linear Paul traps [13, 14]. For singly

charged ions in such traps, the lighter species will in general segregate into a cylindrically

shaped structure surrounded by the heavier ion species. In the case of 40Ca+ and 24Mg+

ions, the structures of the lighter species [13] were found for the most part to be identical to

the cylindrical structures of inﬁnitely long one-species systems conﬁned in two-dimensions

by a rotational-symmetric harmonic potential [15]. For two ion species with identical charge-

to-mass ratios, mixing of the species is predicted [16]. At present, Coulomb crystals ﬁnd

applications in such diverse ﬁelds as quantum computing [17, 18] and cold molecule ion

research [14, 19, 20].

In this Letter, we present observations of persistent long-range ordered structures in the

40Ca+ component of bicrystals consisting of 40Ca+ and 44Ca+ ions. The observed structures

deviate from those expected for a fully rotational symmetric harmonic potential [13, 15], but

are in close agreement with results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including the

quadrupole nature of the trapping ﬁelds.

The Ca+ ions are conﬁned in a linear Paul trap which is situated in a vacuum chamber at
a pressure of 10−10 Torr, and are laser cooled as depicted in Fig. 1(a). The Paul trap used

in these experiments has been described in detail elsewhere [21]. In short, the linear Paul

trap consists of four electrode rods placed in a quadrupole conﬁguration. The electrode

diameter is 8.0 mm and the minimum distance of the central trap axis is r0 = 3.5 mm.

is also applicable to the individual components of such crystals.

The 40Ca+ and 44Ca+ ions used in the experiments are produced isotope selectively by

resonant two-photon photo-ionization of atoms in an eﬀusive beam of naturally abundant

calcium [22, 23]. In Fig. 1(b), the transitions in Ca+ used for Doppler laser cooling of the

trapped ions are shown. The main cooling transition is the dipole allowed 4S1/2

transition at 397 nm. To avoid optical pumping into the metastable 3D3/2 state, repumping
is done either by using a single repump laser at 866 nm via the 4P1/2 state (44Ca+) or by
using two repump lasers at 850 nm and 854 nm via the 4P3/2 state (40Ca+). Due to the

isotope shifts of the cooling transitions [24, 25], each isotope ion requires its own laser cooling

frequencies. As indicated in Fig. 1(a), we use a 397 nm frequency doubled Ti:Sapphire laser

and a 866 nm diode laser for the cooling of 44Ca+ ions, while for the 40Ca+ ions 397 nm, 850

nm and 854 nm diode lasers are applied. For both isotopes the ﬁnal temperature is of the

order of

10 mK, which is low enough for achieving Coulomb crystallization (Γ

250 [2]).

Imaging of the ﬂuorescence from the trapped ions is achieved using an image intensiﬁed

CCD camera placed above the trap.

Images of two-species Coulomb crystals consisting of 40Ca+ and 44Ca+ ions are presented

in Fig. 2 for various settings of the static voltage Uend on the end-electrodes. Since the ions

are only ﬂuorescing when they are directly laser cooled, the two isotopes can be imaged

separately by alternatingly blocking (about 1 Hz rep. rate) the 850 nm (40Ca+ laser cooling

oﬀ) and the 866 nm laser (44Ca+ laser cooling oﬀ) using mechanical shutters. The presented

combined images are subsequently created with a red color coding for 40Ca+ and blue for

44Ca+. Due to sympathetic cooling [26, 27], the crystal retains its shape and structure

during the alternating laser cooling sequence. As expected [13], the lightest isotope 40Ca+

is located as a cylindrical core closest to the trap axis, surrounded by the heavier 44Ca+.

It is immediately clear from the images in Fig. 2 that the projection of the actual three-

dimensional structure of the 40Ca+ ions is a two-dimensional rectangular lattice aligned with

the trap axis. Since the depth of focus of the imaging system (

50 µm) is several times

∼

the inter-ion distance, we conclude the rectangular structure in the images must originate

from a three-dimensional long-range ordering [8]. In contrast to our previous observations

of long-range order in spherical one-component ion crystals [8], where the orientation of the

observed metastable (

100 ms) structures seemed to be arbitrary, the rectangular structures

presented here are very persistent (

10 s) and always oriented the same way. Accordingly,

we conclude that the presence of the surrounding 44Ca+ ions has a great impact on the

∼

∼

formation and appearance of the observed long-range structure in the 40Ca+ part of the

crystal. The image sequence in Fig. 2 illustrates additionally that despite changes in the

outer shape of the 40Ca+ core, the observed rectangular lattice of the ions is preserved,

indicating that the observed long-range ordered structure is rather stable to changes in the

boundary conditions of the crystal.

40Ca+ ions (red) and 2000 44Ca+ ions (blue) using a pseudo potential approximation ((a) and (b))

and using the full rf potential ((c) and (d)), respectively. While (a) and (c) show a projection of

all the ion positions onto the xy-plane, (b) and (d) present the data points contained in a slice of

thickness 24 µm through the crystal center projected to the xz-plane. The slices are indicated by

white dashed lines in (a) and (c). Trap potentials are Urf = 540 V and Uend = 33 V.

In order to understand the observations, a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations

6

of two-species crystals with the same number of the two calcium isotope ions as in the

crystals shown in Fig. 2 have been performed.

In Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), results from one

simulation using a pseudo-potential corresponding to the trapping parameters of Fig. 2(b)

is presented. As in the experiments, a clear radial separation of the two isotope ions is

observed. Furthermore the radial projection (Fig. 3(a)) clearly reveals that the 40Ca+ part

of the crystal is organized in concentric cylindrical structures, resembling the structure of

an inﬁnitely long 1D cylindrically symmetric conﬁned ion crystal [13, 15]. In Fig. 3(b), a

projection corresponding to the focal region of the imaging system is shown. Neither this nor

other sections, e.g., in the yz-plane, lead to projection images with rectangular structures.

However, when the full rf potential is used in the MD simulations, some regular ordering in

the central component of the crystal does appear, as is evident from the results presented in

Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) for a speciﬁc phase of the rf ﬁeld. From Fig. 3(d), it is seen that indeed

a rectangular projection image is expected when the rf-quadrupole ﬁeld, which breaks the

rotational symmetry, is included in the simulations. Even when averaging over all phases

of the rf ﬁeld, the rectangular structure persists. However, some blurring of the position of

the ions along the x-axis, as is seen in the images of Fig. 2, is found. Analysis of a much

simpler two-ion system in a linear rf trap has previously shown similar preferred orientation

eﬀects with respect to the rf quadrupole ﬁeld axes [28].

A closer analysis of the simulation results presented in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) shows that the

40Ca+ ions in the core organize themselves in a long-range ordered structure in the form of a

face-centered tetragonal (fct) lattice as illustrated in Fig. 4(a), with the sidelengths related

by a = b = c/√3. The rectangular projection presented in Fig. 3(d) is obtained when

the fct structure is viewed along the b vector as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). This rectangular

projection has a height to width ratio of hfct/wfct

1.73, which is not exactly the same

≃

as the h/w = 1.62

0.07 observed in the experiments. In fact, the observed rectangular

±

structure is more in agreement with a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure viewed along the

[211] direction (see Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)), which would lead to hfcc/wfcc

1.63. The reason for

≃

the deviation between the simulated results and the actually observed structures is probably

that the diﬀerence in the potential energies of the two structures in the rf potential is very

small, as is well-known to be the case for various long-range ordered structures in inﬁnite

systems without the presence of rf ﬁelds [3]. In recent single component experiments both

body-centered cubic (bcc) and fcc-like structures were indeed observed [8], but in contrast

to the two-species results above, no ﬁxed orientation with respect to the trap axis was

found. Another point supporting that the observed structure is a fcc structure is the ion

density. Assuming that the observed projection images of 40Ca+ ions in Fig. 2 are actually fcc

108
structures observed along the [211] direction, the ion density must be nfcc = (3.8
cm−3. In comparison, the 40Ca+ ion density calculated from the trap parameters is ntheo,40 =

108, in good agreement with the fcc assumption.

In conclusion, very persistent three-dimensional long-range ordered structures have been

observed in 40Ca+-44Ca+ two-species ion Coulomb crystals in a linear Paul trap. The ob-

served structures and their orientations are found to be in reasonable agreement with MD

results only when the rf quadrupole ﬁeld is included in the simulations. Very stable oriented

crystal structures such as these may in the future ﬁnd many applications as, for example,

atomic media for cavity QED studies and quantum memories for light [29].

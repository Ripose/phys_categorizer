Abstract

Suppose an electric current I ﬂows along a magnetic ﬂux tube that has poloidal ﬂux ψ and radius

a = a(z) where z is the axial position along the ﬂux tube. This current creates a toroidal magnetic

ﬁeld Bφ. It is shown that, in such a case, non-linear, non-conservative J

B forces accelerate plasma

×

axially from regions of small a to regions of large a and that this acceleration is proportional to
∂I 2/∂z. Thus, if a current-carrying ﬂux tube is bulged at, say, z = 0 and constricted at, say,

z =

h, then plasma will be accelerated from z =

h towards z = 0 resulting in a situation similar

to two water jets pointed at each other. The ingested plasma convects embedded, frozen-in toroidal

magnetic ﬂux from z =

h to z = 0. The counter-directed ﬂows collide and stagnate at z = 0

and in so doing (i) convert their translational kinetic energy into heat, (ii) increase the plasma

density at z

0, and (iii) increase the embedded toroidal ﬂux density at z

0. The increase in

and so causes a reduction of a(0). Thus, the ﬂux tube develops an axially uniform cross-section,

a decreased volume, an increased density, and an increased temperature. This model is proposed

as a likely hypothesis for the long-standing mystery of why solar coronal loops are observed to be

axially uniform, hot, and bright. It is furthermore argued that a small number of tail particles

bouncing between the approaching counterstreaming plasma jets should be Fermi accelerated to

extreme energies. Finally, analytic solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation predicts that a ﬂux

tube becomes axially uniform when the ingested plasma becomes hot and dense enough to have

with this relationship which is analogous to having βpol = 1 in a tokamak.

INTRODUCTION

A long standing mystery in solar physics is why solar coronal loops typically have an ax-

ially uniform cross-section [1]; i.e., a ﬁlamentary shape. This issue has been made especially

pressing by recent TRACE (Transition Region and Coronal Explorer ) spacecraft soft x-ray

images which show a multitude of highly-deﬁned axially uniform loops [2]; for example, see

Fig. 1. Axial uniformity of ﬂux tubes is also commonly observed in laboratory experiments,

for example, in recent simulations of solar prominences [3].

FIG. 1: TRACE soft X-ray photo showing axial uniformity of coronal loops (image courtesy

Lockheed Martin Space and Astrophysics Lab). As discussed in the text, the slight wrapping of

ﬂux tube #1 around ﬂux tube #2 indicates that net currents ﬂow along the ﬂux tubes.

2

This paper argues that axial uniformity is the result of a rather complex sequence of

events which occur whenever an electric current I is made to ﬂow along an initially axially

non-uniform, current-free, axisymmetric magnetic ﬂux tube (a process corresponding to

injection of magnetic helicity into the ﬂux tube). The sequence of events occurs even when

I is modest, i.e., even when the ﬂux tube is only slightly twisted.

FIG. 2: (a) Potential (i.e., current-free) coronal loop above solar surface with corresponding sub-

surface ﬁeld and source currents. The cross-section of the loop is largest at the top of the loop

where the magnetic ﬁeld is weakest; (b) straight cylindrical representation of coronal loop used in

model.

The typical arched shape of coronal loops is shown schematically in Fig. 2a; to make

the analysis tractable we will assume that the loop is straight as sketched in Fig. 2b.

3

However, in order to retain an important aspect of the arched shape, we will allow the

length of the straight loop to vary to take into account possible variability in the length

of the arched loop. The Fig. 2b geometry will be characterized by a straight cylindrical

coordinate system

r, φ, z

where z refers to the direction along the loop axis, φ is the

{

}

azimuthal direction about the axis, and r is the distance from the axis. The φ direction is

called the toroidal direction and the r, z directions are called poloidal. Flux coordinates will

also be used when appropriate. This poloidal/toroidal nomenclature is formally the same

as that used for tokamaks, but the conﬁguration should not be confused with a tokamak as

there are no closed poloidal ﬁeld lines. The current I will be assumed to be relatively small

so that the poloidal ﬁeld magnitude

Bz is always much larger than Bφ in which case the

∼

ﬂux tube is only slightly twisted. We note that this straight cylindrical approximation of

ﬂux tube geometry has been used in many previous studies of ﬂux tube equilibria, especially

force-free equilibria (for example, see Refs.[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]). However, the analysis presented

here diﬀers substantively from these previous studies because our analysis does not begin

by assuming existence of an equilibrium. Instead, our analysis characterizes the dynamics

that lead to an equilibrium and shows how the resulting equilibrium is intimately related to

these dynamics. Furthermore, our analysis takes into account the non-force-free aspects of

the equilibrium (i.e., ﬁnite pressure gradients) and shows that these ﬁnite β aspects are of

vital importance to the axial uniformity of the equilibrium.

Because of the assumed axisymmetry in Fig. 2b, the magnetic ﬁeld can be expressed as

where

φ = ˆφ/r and

is the poloidal ﬂux. Axial non-uniformity corresponds to having ∂ψ/∂z
bulging corresponds to having ψ−1∂2ψ/∂z2 > 0. The current I is similarly given as

I(r, z, t) =

Jz(r′, z, t)2πr′dr′

and is related to the toroidal ﬁeld by Ampere’s law, i.e., µ0I = 2πrBφ. The current rise time

τ is assumed to be suﬃciently slow that Alfv´en wave propagation eﬀects are unimportant

i.e., it is assumed that vAτ >> h where 2h is the length of the ﬂux tube. The current thus

Controversy exists regarding the properties of I(r, z) external to the current-carrying ﬂux

tube. Some authors [10, 11] argue that I must vanish outside the ﬂux tube while others

[12, 13, 14, 15] argue that I should be ﬁnite outside. If one insists that I vanishes outside

the ﬂux tube so that there is no net current in a ﬂux tube, the ﬂux tube acts like a coaxial

cable (i.e., a center conductor sheathed by a coaxial outer conductor carrying equal and

opposite current). This neutralized current conﬁguration has Bφ = 0 external to the ﬂux

tube and so cannot produce magnetic forces on external currents. Adjacent neutralized ﬂux

tubes thus cannot exert forces on each other and so will not mutually interact, just like

adjacent coaxial cables will not mutually interact. Furthermore, sections at diﬀerent axial

positions along the length of a neutralized ﬂux tube cannot interact via magnetic forces.

The lack of interaction between sections at diﬀerent axial positions along the length of a

neutralized ﬂux tube means that such a ﬂux tube cannot undergo a kink instability since a

kink instability involves relaxing to the state of lowest mutual interaction energy between

loop segments (similarly, a coaxial cable will not undergo a kink instability since there is no

force between axially separated segments).

In contrast, having a net current (i.e., being non-neutralized) implies existence of an

external potential magnetic ﬁeld Bφ

I/r outside of the ﬂux tube just like the magnetic

∼

ﬁeld external to an ordinary current-carrying wire. An individual ﬂux tube with net current

can kink since, if its axis bends, there will be forces between sections at diﬀerent axial

positions. Two ﬂux tubes, each carrying net current, will experience mutual interaction

forces due to the Bφ of one ﬂux tube interacting with the current of the other ﬂux tube.

Thus, two adjacent ﬂux tubes each with net current will tend to wrap around each other as

shown in Fig. 2a of Ref.[16] since the axis of each ﬂux tube will be aﬀected by the Bφ of

its neighbor. Since we are assuming here that Bφ << Bz this wrapping will be very slight.

Examination of the loop structures #1 and #2 denoted by arrows in Fig.1 show that these

two structures do indeed wrap around each other slightly (on the left, loop #1 is to the rear

of loop #2; on the right, the two loops appear to be in the plane of the photo).

Based on the observations that kinks do occur in solar structures and that coronal loops

5

do show evidence of wrapping we will assume in this paper that net current does ﬂow in a ﬂux

tube, i.e., that the current is non-neutralized. This assumption is additionally supported by

recent work by Feldman [17] and by Wheatland[18] who, after careful analysis of a variety

of observational evidence, have concluded that net currents do ﬂow.

The assumption of net current means that we are allowing ﬂux tubes to interact with

each other via magnetic forces. However, since the eﬀect of this interaction is to alter the

three dimensional locus of a ﬂux tube axis, and since we are invoking the straight axis ap-

proximation (i.e. using Fig. 2b to represent Fig. 2a), we are removing from consideration

the evolution of the three dimensional locus of the ﬂux tube axis. The straight axis approx-

imation is thus analogous to a kinematics problem where one works in the center of mass

frame of a body and so removes from consideration external body forces that change the

location of the center of mass.

The ﬂux tube ends are at z =

h and the ﬂux tube middle is at z = 0. The ﬂux tube

is assumed to be initially current-free so that initially I = 0. The ﬁeld in the ﬂux tube

is thus initially potential (i.e.,

B =0 initially) and the source currents generating this

potential ﬁeld are external to the ﬂux loop and, as sketched in Fig. 2a, are assumed to be

below the solar surface. Thus the initially potential coronal loop sketched in Fig. 2a will

have a magnetic ﬁeld that is stronger at the footpoints than at the arch top because the

arch top is further from the source currents. This means that the initial current-free ﬂux

tube will be bulged at the top because the magnetic ﬁeld is weaker there. In the straight

geometry representation given by Fig.2b, the bulging at the arch top corresponds to having

the initially potential poloidal ﬁeld stronger at z =

h than at z = 0 and the ﬂux tube

diameter larger at z = 0 than at z =

h.

The sequence of events that occurs when the current is ramped up to a steady-state will

be shown to consist of the following three stages:

1. The ﬁrst stage consists of a twisting of the magnetic ﬁeld about the z axis in Fig.

2b together with an associated transient toroidal plasma velocity Uφ. This stage is

incompressible and maintains the ﬂux tube poloidal proﬁle, i.e., ψ(r, z) is unchanged

and the ﬂux tube remains bulged. The velocity Uφ is proportional to z∂I/∂t and the
toroidal acceleration is proportional to z∂2I/∂t2.

2. The second stage involves generation of axial plasma ﬂows. These ﬂows go from z =

where the ﬂux tube diameter is small to z = 0 where the diameter is large. The ﬂows

−

a nonlinear function of I in contrast to the ﬁrst stage toroidal acceleration which is a

linear function of I.

3. The third stage involves stagnation of the converging ﬂows at z = 0 resulting in plasma

heating as the ﬂow kinetic energy is converted into heat (thermalized). There is also

an accumulation of convected toroidal ﬂux at z = 0 which leads to an enhancement of

the pinch force at z = 0. The enhanced pinch force squeezes the ﬂux tube diameter at

z = 0 so that the ﬂux tube approaches axial uniformity, i.e., ∂ψ/∂z

0. Ultimately,

LACK OF EQUILIBRIUM FOR ARBITRARILY SPECIFIED MAGNETIC

FIELDS

Arbitrarily speciﬁed magnetic ﬁelds do not, in general, have associated MHD equilibria,

i.e., in general, no pressure P (r) exists which satisﬁes

for arbitrarily speciﬁed B(r). The essential physics underlying this assertion is that

P is identically zero whereas

FIG. 3: Poloidal ﬂux surfaces of a magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration for which no ﬁnite pressure gradient

MHD equilibrium is possible.

As a speciﬁc example that equilibria do not exist for arbitrarily speciﬁed magnetic ﬁeld

conﬁgurations, consider the simple situation sketched in Fig. 3. We assert that no MHD

equilibrium is possible for this conﬁguration, i.e., this conﬁguration cannot satisfy Eq. (8).

This assertion is established by calculating radial pressure balance at axial locations z1 and

z2 where the respective ﬂux tube radii are a and b with b > a. If satisﬁed, Eq. (8) imposes

the requirement B

P = 0 which means that the pressure must be the same everywhere

on a ﬁeld line.

·∇

The poloidal component of the magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be straight, uniform, and

in the z direction at both z1 and z2. Because the ﬁeld lines are more densely packed at z1

than at z2, the magnetic ﬁeld is such that Bz(z1) > Bz(z2). In addition, since the poloidal

magnetic ﬁeld is uniform at z1 and z2, the toroidal current vanishes at both z1 and z2 [in

fact, uniformity of poloidal ﬁeld is more than is needed for the toroidal current to vanish as

the most general requirement for the toroidal current to vanish is to have

Using Jφ = 0 the radial component of Eq.(8) is therefore

which implies that I = I(ψ). Since the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld is straight and uniform at
both z1 and z2, the poloidal ﬂux function must have the form ψ = ψ0r2/a2 at z1 and
ψ = ψ0r2/b2 at z2 where ψ0 is the ﬂux on the surface for which P vanishes and a, b are the

respective radii of these ﬂux surfaces at z1 and z2. The simplest non-trivial possibility for

I = I(ψ) is to assume that I is a linear function of ψ so

z-axis. Equation (8) is therefore not satisﬁed and so equilibrium does not exist. Because

there is radial pressure balance but not axial pressure balance, we might expect ﬂows to be

driven from z1 to z2. The situation is analogous to squeezing the end of a toothpaste tube

and having toothpaste squirt out the mouth of the tube.

III. GENERAL CASE USING FLUX COORDINATES

Let us now return to the problem of a coronal loop which is initially current-free and

bulging at z = 0, but then has an externally driven current I slowly ramped up to a constant

value. We deﬁne a right-handed orthogonal coordinate system based on the poloidal ﬂux

coordinates. The unit vectors of this system are

We now argue that Jψ, Jφ, and JBpol each have distinctive physics.

The component Jψ ﬂows normal to ﬂux surfaces and provides the torque that causes

the plasma to rotate toroidally. This current can only be transient and is identiﬁed as

the polarization current [19]. Polarization current can be thought of as being an essentially

dependent quantity; that is, one ﬁrst determines the amount of toroidal acceleration using an

analysis that does not involve the equation of motion, and then one inserts this acceleration

into the equation of motion to calculate the required polarization current. The reason for

this inferior status of the toroidal component of the equation of motion is that the toroidal

symmetry of the system provides a strong constraint on the dynamics. From an MHD point

of view, the toroidal symmetry means that no toroidal pressure gradient can exist and also

no toroidal electrostatic electric ﬁeld can exist. From a particle Hamiltonian point of view,

this symmetry means that the maximum excursion particles can make from a ﬂux surface

is no more than a poloidal Larmor radius [20], a microscopic length. The localization of

particles to the vicinity of a ﬂux surface means that there cannot be any sustained net

current density in the direction normal to a ﬂux surface and so Jψ is highly constrained. All

that is allowed is a short-lived transient Jψ having zero time-average; i.e., Jψ can only be an

AC current. The slight bobbing back and forth of particles oﬀ of a ﬂux surface constitutes

the polarization current. Thus the plasma acts like a capacitor in the direction normal to the

ﬂux surfaces, but like a wire in the direction along the ﬂux surfaces. As is well known[21],
the dielectric constant of the plasma “capacitor” is given by µ0ρc2/B2 = c2/v2

A >> 1.

Polarization currents have an associated polarization electric ﬁeld normal to the ﬂux surface

resulting from the particles making their small excursions from their nominal ﬂux surface.

The current I is assumed to be generated by some sub-surface dynamo and so its time-

dependence is a prescribed quantity. This time dependence is assumed to be such that I

10

increases smoothly from zero to some ﬁnite value in a characteristic time τ >> h/vA. This

smooth increase can be represented by the characteristic time proﬁle

I(t) =

(tanh(t/τ ) + 1)

so that I = 0 for t <<

FIG. 4: First stage dynamics: Top shows ﬂux tube when I = 0. Bottom shows ﬂux tube when I

is ﬁnite, but ψ(r, z) is not yet changed from its initial potential value. The evolution from the top

to the bottom situation involves toroidal rotation by a ﬁnite amount, but no poloidal ﬂows.

A. First stage (ramp-up)

At the beginning of the ﬁrst stage I is zero and the ﬂux tube is untwisted as shown in

We will show that Upol results from a weak non-linear force and so is negligible at times

0 because there has not been enough time for a signiﬁcant Upol to develop. In contrast,

t

Uφ is proportional to ∂I/∂t and so Uφ is large at t

However Uφ goes to zero at large times when ∂I/∂t

precedes the time when Upol is ﬁnite. The ﬁrst stage characterizes the time t

Equation (27) clearly shows that Jψ is indeed the polarization current and that Jψ is essen-
tially a dependent quantity since it is proportional to ∂2I/∂t2. The polarization current is

transient and, for positive s, is ﬁrst negative and then positive (and vice versa for negative

s). Both Uφ and the polarization current Jψ vanish when I is in steady state. The chain of

dependence is such that the induction equation ﬁrst determines Uφ which then determines

Jψ via the equation of motion. For a long, thin ﬂux tube, s

state and so Uφ = 0 for t >> τ.

B. Second stage (steady I, development of ﬁnite Upol)

Since I is constant in the second stage, Uφ and Jψ are both zero. Equation (16) shows

that Jψ = 0 implies I = I(ψ) in which case surfaces of constant ψ(r, z) are also surfaces of

constant I(r, z). At the beginning of the second stage, Upol has not yet developed and so

ψ(r, z) is assumed to be unchanged from its initial potential (vacuum) state, i.e., the poloidal

proﬁle of the ﬂux surfaces is not yet deformed. Thus, Jφ =

ﬁelds.

B force when I is constant. Solid line shows

×

initial constant ψ(r, z) ﬂux surface, dashed line shows same ﬂux surface at a later time. Fluid

elements (shown hatched) are pushed axially towards z = 0 while staying on the same constant ψ

surface. The resulting ﬂuid ﬂows collide at the z = 0 plane where they thermalize their directed

kinetic energy. Toroidal ﬂux and mass accumulate at the z = 0 layer also. The accumulation of

toroidal ﬂux at z = 0 increases Bφ there and so pinches down the ﬂux tube diameter causing the

ﬂux tube to become axially uniform.

C. Third stage (convection of toroidal ﬂux, ﬂuid stagnation, heating, compression)

The force given by Eq.(29) has a ﬁnite curl and so cannot be balanced by a pressure

gradient so long as the original potential proﬁle of ψ(r, z) is maintained. Thus, the only way

for an equilibrium to develop is for the proﬁle of ψ(r, z) to change. This is clearly evident

from the discussion in Section III(B): Eq.(35) shows that axial equilibrium can only occur

if ∂a/∂z

0.

Attainment of equilibrium involves several inter-related hydrodynamic, magnetic, and

thermodynamic phenomena which are shown schematically in Fig. 5. The solid lines in Fig.

surface at a later time. Typical ﬂuid elements are shown as hatched parallelograms (cross-

sections of toroids) and the motion of these elements is seen to consist of both axial and

radial motion such that each ﬂuid element stays on its own constant ψ surface. The non-

B force is shown in Fig. 5 by the longer length at larger

B. The axial motion corresponds to plasma ﬂows which

h, travel towards z = 0, and then converge and stagnate at z = 0 like

two water jets pointed at each other. The stagnation converts the ﬂow kinetic energy into

heat and simultaneously increases the plasma density at z = 0 as plasma accumulates there.

Thus pressure increases at z = 0. Furthermore, toroidal ﬂux embedded in the plasma is

convected by the axial ﬂows and so there will also be an accumulation of toroidal ﬂux at

z = 0. This means that the density of the toroidal ﬂux will also increase at z = 0, i.e., Bφ

will increase in the vicinity of z = 0.

The increase in Bφ can be established more rigorously by considering Eq.(20) in the

vicinity of z = 0 and taking into account that (i) Uφ = 0 since I is constant, (ii) Upol

at z = 0 since the ﬂow stagnates at z = 0, and (iii)

Upol < 0 near z = 0 since the ﬂows

∇ ·

are converging at z = 0. Thus, Eq.(20) in the vicinity of z = 0 reduces to

which shows that Bφ must increase since

which can be combined with the induction equation to give

showing that Bφ increases in proportion to the increase in mass density at the stagnation

layer. Since I is constant and 2πrBφ = µ0I the current channel radius in the vicinity of the

stagnation layer must decrease as Bφ increases to keep rBφ constant. Thus, the bulge of the

current channel must diminish as sketched in Fig. 5 and, because I = I(ψ), the bulge of the

constant ψ surfaces must also diminish. The result is that the ﬂux tube tends to become

axially uniform, hot, and dense.

D. Changes in length

Making the ﬂux tube axially uniform increases Bpol because squeezing the poloidal ﬂux

surfaces together results in a larger ﬁeld. Since Bpol

Bz

is much larger than Bφ, it

∼

would seem that too much energy would have to be invested into squeezing the poloidal ﬂux

surfaces together. However, if we recall that the loop is really arched and allow the loop

length to change in such a way that

Bpol

dl remains constant where the line integral is

over the length of the loop, then the loop length 2h will become shorter as Bpol increases.

It is reasonable to assume that

Bpol

dl remains constant, because Bpol is produced by

currents external to the ﬂux tube (e.g., by the subsurface currents sketched in Fig. 2a).

These source currents may be assumed to stay constant on the time scale during which the

ﬂux tube undergoes stages 1-3. If one follows the poloidal ﬁeld along its entire length both

above and below the solar surface, then it must satisfy Ampere’s law

Thus, as the poloidal ﬁeld lines squeeze together to make the ﬂux tube axially uniform,

the ﬂux tube becomes shorter in such a way as to keep the energy stored in the poloidal ﬁeld

constant. In this manner, no work needs to be done to squeeze the poloidal ﬂux surfaces

together. One can imagine that the “ﬁeld line tension” of the poloidal ﬁeld shortens the

length of the loop as the poloidal ﬁeld is made stronger when the poloidal ﬂux surfaces are

squeezed together.

If β = α2a2
that P vanishes when ψ = ψ0 is the particular solution ψ = ψ0r2/a2

0. However, this solution

is axially uniform and so we no longer need to specify a0 as being the radius at z = 0; it is

in fact the radius at all z. Equation (49) provides the important result that having a ﬁnite

but extremely small β will cause the poloidal ﬂux surfaces to diﬀer substantially from the

force-free situation where β is exactly zero and in particular will cause the system to become
axially uniform when β = α2a2

0/2. From a mathematical point of view this is because the

right hand side of Eq.(46) is an inhomogeneous term (source term) of the partial diﬀerential

equation. The source term results in there being a particular solution which would not exist

if Eq.(46) were homogeneous, i.e., if β were exactly zero.

The axial uniformity condition β = α2a2/2 is just Eq. (44) and so we conclude that

the β produced by ﬂow stagnation is precisely the β required to force the Grad-Shafranov

19

equation to give an axially uniform solution. We further conclude that, given suﬃcient time

and assuming there are no losses, current-carrying ﬂux tubes will always tend to become

axially uniform and will always tend to have the β given by Eq.(44). This result is similar to

the well-known property [28] of tokamaks having βpol of order unity because diamagnetism

exactly balances paramagnetism so that the resulting ﬁeld is a potential (vacuum) ﬁeld. The

roles of poloidal and toroidal directions are interchanged in the coronal loop compared to a

tokamak and so in the coronal loop it is βφ which is of order unity.

To make a prediction, a nominal observed ﬂux loop radius a = 1.6

The predicted β can be compared with actual observed values of β in solar coronal loops.
106 m [2] and a nominal
10−8 m−1 are used [29]. These parameters predict a nominal
measured active region α = 2
10−4. The observed value βobserved is calculated using a nominal
βpredicted = α2a2/2 = 5
density n = 1015 m−3, and a nominal temperature 106 K [2]. In addition a nominal axial
10−2 T is assumed based on the argument that since the ﬂux

magnetic ﬁeld Bz = 1.5

value as the nominal Bz = 1.5
give βobserved = 2µ0nκT /B2

×
z = 4

This model also has implications regarding the brightening typically observed when the

×

×

axis of a coronal loop starts to writhe and the loop develops a kink instability (sigmoid).

Since kink instability occurs when αh
2π [30, 31, 32, 33, 34] and for a long thin ﬂux tube
a << h, this model predicts that β = α2a2/2 << α2h2/2 will still be small even if α is

∼

increased to the point where αh
2π and kink instability occurs. However, β will increase
as α increases. Since the brightness of a loop is proportional to n2 for a given temperature,

∼

this model predicts that the loop should brighten in proportion to the writhing of its axis

(i.e., in proportion to α as αh approaches unity).

The model thus provides a heating mechanism (stagnation of MHD-driven ﬂows) which is

consistent with observed coronal temperatures and densities; however, the prediction is for

nκT rather than for temperature or density separately; a more detailed analysis would be

required to isolate the individual dependence of temperature and density on the stagnation

process.

20

F. Energetic Tail

As the ﬂows converge, there will be a few particles which have collision mean free paths

and trajectories such that they bounce back and forth between converging ﬂuid elements.

Because these particles gain energy on each bounce between the converging ﬂows, these

particles will gain energy without bound until desynchronized or lost, i.e., they will undergo

Fermi acceleration [35]. The number of particles having the appropriate mean free path will

be small, so one will expect a small high energy tail located around z = 0. The concentration

of high energy particles around z = 0, i.e., at the top of a loop, is in fact what is observed

[17].

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that the apparently simple problem of driving an electric current along a

pre-existing potential magnetic ﬂux tube is actually quite complicated and consists of three

stages. In real situations these stages would overlap and not be as distinct as outlined here.

The ﬁrst stage involves a twisting of the magnetic ﬁeld and an associated z-dependent

toroidal rotation (i.e., twisting) of the plasma; this motion is incompressible. The second

stage involves convergent axial ﬂows driven by the nonlinear, non-conservative force asso-
ciated with the axial gradient of B2

φ/µ0. The third stage involves accumulation of both

mass and toroidal ﬂux at z = 0 and a simultaneous conversion of directed ﬂow energy into

thermal energy, i.e., stagnation. The concomitant increase in toroidal magnetic ﬁeld at the

stagnation layer ultimately leads to an equilibrium and because the ﬂow stagnation gives
β = α2a2/2 the equilibrium is axially uniform. This sequence of events should be quite

common and should explain why current-carrying ﬂux tubes are so often observed to be

ﬁlamentary.

Finally, it should be emphasized that symmetries in both φ and in z play a critical

role in the behavior described here. Symmetry in φ (i.e., toroidal symmetry) prevents the

existence of any toroidal electrostatic ﬁeld so that the only allowed toroidal electric ﬁeld is
(2πr)−1∂ψ/∂t.

the toroidal electric ﬁeld associated with changing poloidal ﬂux, i.e., Eφ =

−

Particles are therefore constrained to stay within a poloidal Larmor radius of a ﬂux surface

so that there can only be AC currents in the direction normal to a ﬂux surface in which case

21

the plasma acts like a capacitor in the direction normal to the ﬂux surfaces. Because toroidal

acceleration is driven only by the current normal to a ﬂux surface and because no toroidal

pressure gradient is allowed, the toroidal motion is constrained to be transient, ﬁnite, and

dependent on the temporal behavior of I. Thus when I is constant, poloidal current ﬂows

along poloidal ﬂux surfaces and there is no toroidal motion. Symmetry about the z = 0

plane causes this plane to be a stagnation layer where opposing plasma jets collide resulting

in accumulation of mass and of frozen-in toroidal magnetic ﬂux and also a thermalization

of the ﬂow kinetic energy.

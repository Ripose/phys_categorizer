(Dated: January 28, 2014)

We present long-time simulations of expanding ultracold neutral plasmas, including a full treat-
ment of the strongly coupled ion dynamics. Thereby, the relaxation dynamics of the expanding
laser-cooled plasma is studied, taking into account elastic as well as inelastic collisions. It is demon-
strated that, depending on the initial conditions, the ionic component of the plasma may exhibit
short-range order or even a superimposed long-range order resulting in concentric ion shells.
In
contrast to ionic plasmas conﬁned in traps, the shell structures are built up from the center of the
plasma cloud rather than from the periphery.

It is well known that, depending on the Coulomb cou-
pling parameter (CCP) Γ = e2/akBT , a plasma may
show long-range order, short-range order or no order at
all. In general, ordering eﬀects can be expected in the
1) where the in-
so-called strongly coupled regime (Γ
terparticle Coulomb interaction e2/a dominates the ther-
mal energy kBT of the plasma particles. This parameter
regime has been studied extensively in nonneutral plas-
mas of laser-cooled ions conﬁned in ion traps [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
On the other hand, much less is known about the dynam-
ics of ﬁnite, strongly coupled neutral plasmas without
conﬁnement. Due to their expansion, these plasmas are
in a non-equilibrium state at all times, and it is not clear
whether dramatic ordering eﬀects such as Coulomb crys-
tallization known from static trapped ionic plasmas can
be observed in such a system.

≪

Experimentally, cold neutral plasmas could be real-
ized only recently by photoionizing a cloud of ultracold
(T
1K) atoms [6, 7, 8]. Yet, under the present exper-
imental conditions, the regime of a strongly correlated
plasma cannot be reached [9, 10, 11]. Since the plasma
is created in a completely uncorrelated state, the subse-
quent conversion of potential into kinetic energy rapidly
heats both the electron and ion subsystem, suppressing
the development of substantial correlations [9, 10]. Ad-
ditionally, inelastic collisions with Rydberg atoms, previ-
ously formed by three-body recombination (TBR), and
the TBR itself [11, 12] heat the electron gas. Therefore,
Γi decreases to unity while Γe becomes even smaller,
preventing strong correlation eﬀects. However, further
Doppler cooling of the ions during the plasma expansion
has been suggested as a possible route to strongly coupled
ultracold plasmas [13, 14].

In the following we provide the ﬁrst theoretical de-
scription for the expansion of such a laser-cooled neutral
plasma. As we will demonstrate, strong-coupling phe-
nomena can indeed occur in such a system, leading to
the formation of surprisingly diﬀerentiated patterns in
the ionic plasma given the appropriate initial conditions.
From a nonlinear dynamics point of view one might char-
acterize these phenomena as self organization of a system

in a non-equilibrium state.

In a ﬁrst step we describe the collisionless plasma dy-
namics by a set of coupled Vlasov equations for the elec-
trons and ions [15], neglecting any correlation eﬀects.
Cooling of the ions is modelled by introducing a Fokker-
Planck term into the ion kinetic equation [16]

Here, fi is the one-particle distribution function of the
ions, mi is the ion mass and the damping rate β and
the Doppler temperature Tc are determined by the de-
tails of the laser cooling process. Assuming quasineu-
trality together with an adiabatic treatment of the elec-
trons, one can show that the resulting ionic kinetic equa-
tion permits a Gaussian selfsimilar solution fi (r, v)

As seen from Eq. (2), the action of the cooling laser is
twofold. The ion temperature is driven towards its equi-
librium value Tc, while γ is linearly damped out on a
timescale of β−1. Eq. (2) still has one integral of motion,

during the plasma expansion. If Ti ≪
description of the plasma dynamics can be obtained by
neglecting terms of order γ compared to the damping

FIG. 1: The size of a laser-cooled plasma as compared to that
of a freely expanding plasma of the same initial-state param-
eters (dotted). The solution of Eq. (2) (dashed) matches the
PIC-treatment (circles), showing that the diﬀerence to the
hybrid-MD simulation (solid) comes from the ionic correla-
tions. The inset shows a comparison of the numerical solution
with the analytical approximation Eq. (3).

Doppler cooling of the ions not only reduces their temper-
ature but also drastically retards the decrease in plasma
density, supporting development of strong correlations.

p

In a second step, we have performed a more elaborate
numerical simulation based on a hybrid method treating
the two plasma components on diﬀerent levels of sophis-
tication. Since the electrons are not strongly coupled and
their relaxation time, determined by the electron plasma
frequency, is small compared to both the plasma expan-
sion time and the inverse of the ionic plasma frequency
4πe2ρ/mi, an equilibrium ﬂuid model provides
ωp =
an adequate description of the electron dynamics [11].
We account for the initial electron evaporation by deter-
mining the fraction of trapped electrons from the results
of Ref. [6]. The ions move as classical particles under the
action of the electronic mean ﬁeld and the direct ion-ion
interaction calculated with a particle tree-procedure de-
veloped in [18]. In analogy to Eq. (1), cooling is described
by adding a Langevin force to the ion equations of mo-
tion. The electron temperature is determined by energy
conservation for the total system consisting of the plasma
and the radiation ﬁeld. This hybrid treatment allows us
to study eﬀects of strong ion correlation over long times,
since atomic timescales need not be resolved as in a full
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation [9, 19].

In Fig. 1, we compare the time dependence of the
plasma rms-radius obtained from Eq. (2) with the hybrid-
MD simulation and the analytical approximation Eq. (3).
There is good overall agreement between the two numer-
ical approaches. Moreover, they both nicely reproduce
the asymptotic √t-behavior of Eq. (3). On the other
hand, the width calculated from the MD simulation is
signiﬁcantly shifted to lower values. A comparison with
a particle-in-cell (PIC) treatment of the ions, also shown

2

in Fig. 1, clearly reveals that the slower plasma expansion
is due to the negative correlation pressure [9, 17], which
partly compensates the thermal electron pressure. Note
that here the inﬂuence of ion correlations is completely
diﬀerent from the case of free plasma expansion, where
the initial correlation heating was found to dominate the
negative correlation pressure and hence accelerates the
plasma expansion [17].

Up to this point, we have taken into account the
electron-ion interaction on the basis of a mean ﬁeld de-
scription only. However, it has been found that electron-
ion collisions leading to the formation of Rydberg atoms
through TBR may signiﬁcantly alter the expansion dy-
namics at these low electron temperatures [6, 11]. In or-
der to include these processes in our description, we use a
Monte-Carlo treatment [12, 20] to account for TBR and
inelastic electron-Rydberg atom collisions.
In addition
to these processes the inﬂuence of the cooling laser on
the Rydberg atoms should be addressed. By the very
nature of the cooling process, a signiﬁcant fraction of
the ions is found in an excited state at all times. Thus,
TBR may produce doubly-excited, and hence autoioniz-
ing, Rydberg atoms with a considerably large rate. (This
process is in close analogy to the production of autoion-
izing Rydberg states by “isolated-core excitation” [21].)
For low enough principal quantum numbers, the autoion-
ization rate of these states becomes comparable to and
even exceeds the radiative decay rate of the excited core.
For the case of strontium, the l-averaged autoionization
rate becomes important at n
50. For electron tem-
peratures of the present type of experiments, Rydberg
atoms typically recombine into states with much higher
n so that Auger ionization does not play a role initially.
However, in the course of the gas evolution the Rydberg
electron moves down the energy ladder by subsequent in-
elastic electron-atom collisions. Since the energy shift of
the core transition used for laser cooling is of the same
order of magnitude as the autoionization rate [25], the
Rydberg atoms formed by TBR are still resonant with
the cooling laser. Hence, even if the timescale of colli-
sional deexcitation is longer than the lifetime of the core-
excited state, the cooling laser will continue to drive the
core transition so that the atom will be in the core-excited
state for a signiﬁcant fraction of time. Because the en-
ergy connected with the core transition is of the order of
104 K, each free electron produced by autoionization will
rapidly leave the plasma volume. Hence, the combined
action of the cooling laser, TBR and collisional deexci-
tation is expected to remove electrons from the plasma
and destroy the plasma, until recombination stops when
the electron density has become too small. In order to
suppress this electron loss one has to choose initial con-
ditions which lead to a tolerable TBR rate [22].

to initial ionic plasma frequency ωp0. The exact values
of Tc and Ti(0) are not important for the plasma ex-
pansion dynamics, since both are negligible compared to
the electron temperature. According to Eq. (2), for ﬁxed
β the time evolution of the scaled density only depends
on the product of Γe and N 2/3
Te is neglected
i
in the second equation of Eq. (2)), the expansion being
slower if ΓeN 2/3
becomes larger. Hence, in order to slow
down the plasma expansion suﬃciently for spatial cor-
relations to develop, one may prefer to increase the ion
number since reduction of the electron temperature be-
comes ultimately incompatible with the objective of lim-
iting TBR. A further constraint on the initial conditions
103 in order to observe
arises from the fact that Γi ≈
ordering eﬀects. Typically, ion temperatures of the order
of 1 mK can be achieved through Doppler cooling, mean-
ing that the initial ion density must be at least about 108
cm−3. Finally, the cooling rate β must be of the order
of 10−1ωp0 to suﬃciently slow down the plasma expan-
sion that correlations can develop. Since β (
1/mi)
decreases faster than ωp0 (
1/√mi) with increasing ion
∝
mass, it is advantageous to consider relatively light ions,
for which suﬃciently high cooling rates can be obtained
experimentally. We therefore choose Be ions for our sim-
ulations, for which laser-cooling has been experimentally
demonstrated earlier in nonneutral plasmas [23].

∝

The most striking result of our simulations is a lattice-
type crystallization of the ions or even their arrange-
ment in concentric shells if the plasma expansion is slow
enough. The emergence of such an order depends sensi-
tively on the initial conditions. We have found a lattice-
type crystallization in the expansion of a plasma of 20000
108 cm−3 and an
Be-ions with an initial density of 1.1

electron temperature of Te = 29 K, cooled with a damp-
ing rate of β = 0.15 ωp0 to an ionic temperature of Tc = 2
mK. The value of Γi = 750 after 52µs, simply calculated
from the ion temperature and the average Wigner-Seitz
radius, suggests strong ordering of the ionic component.
However, as pointed out in [9] the CCP calculated in
this way may have no meaning as a measure of correla-
tions, since the expanding plasma does not reach a global
equilibrium. A more reliable quantity, namely the distri-
bution of inter-ionic distances, is shown in Fig. 2.
In
order to account for the nonhomogeneity of the plasma
we have scaled the inter-particle spacing by the Wigner-
Seitz radius aloc determined by the local density between
the corresponding particles. For comparison, the pair-
correlation function obtained from the HNC-equations
of a homogeneous one-component plasma [24]
is also
shown.
(However, the distribution function shown in
Fig. 2 should not be understood as a pair-correlation
function in a strict sense, since in the present case the
plasma is neither isotropic nor homogeneous.) The re-
markable agreement shows that under present conditions
the calculated CCP indeed indicates the degree of order
in the expanding plasma and that the system has reached
a state of local equilibrium far beyond the known crys-
174 [4]. In order to study the dy-
tallization limit of Γi ≈
namics of the crystallization process we have determined
Γi also from the numerically obtained average correlation
energy together with an analytical approximation for this
quantity [17]. A comparison of the CCPs calculated by
both methods is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. Initially
there are large deviations between both calculations re-
ﬂecting the nonequilibrium character of the early plasma
state. However, after some inverse plasma frequencies,
the ion system reaches a local equilibrium and the CCPs
obtained from the diﬀerent methods become identical.
At longer times both curves may diverge again due to a
freezing out of ordered structures when the density be-

If we further slow down the plasma expansion, by in-
creasing the product ΓeN 2/3
, the system exhibits for-
mation of concentric shells rather than relaxation into
lattice-type structures. This is demonstrated in Fig. 3,
where the radial ion density is shown at t = 24µs for a
plasma with Γe = 0.15 and Ni = 50000 while all other
parameters equal those used for Fig. 2. Besides this
radial ordering into concentric shells, there are strong
intra-shell correlations, also found in trapped nonneu-
tral plasmas [2].
In Fig. 4, we show one of the shells
formed in the simulation of Fig. 3. The development of a
hexagonal-lattice like ordering is evident, which is how-
ever considerably disturbed by the curvature of the shell.
A closer look on the emergence of the order shows that
in the early stages of the plasma evolution a cubic-lattice
like structure is formed. However, after some ten inverse
plasma frequencies the ions rearrange to form concentric
shells starting from the plasma center, where the den-
sity is highest, in contrast to trapped nonneutral plas-
mas where the shell formation was observed to proceed
from the periphery to the center of the cloud [5]. If the
expansion is faster, as in the ﬁrst example (Fig. 2), ion-
ion collisions are less frequent and after the initial phase
of local ordering the density is already too low for the
rearrangement into shells, such that the lattice structure
survives during the expansion.

In summary, we have followed the long-time dynamics
of laser-cooled, expanding ultracold plasmas on the ba-
sis of a hybrid-MD simulation, allowing for a full treat-
ment of the strongly coupled ion dynamics. The results
show that cooling during the plasma expansion dras-
tically modiﬁes the expansion dynamics leading to an
exotic type of plasma where the electron component is
weakly coupled while the ion component shows strong
coupling eﬀects which manifest themselves in the devel-
opment of lattice-like structures (short-range order) or
even the formation of concentric shells (long-range or-
der) depending on the expansion dynamics. Interesting

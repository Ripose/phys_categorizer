The magnetic ﬁeld measured in the Madison Dynamo Experiment shows intermittent periods of
growth when an axial magnetic ﬁeld is applied. The geometry of the intermittent ﬁeld is consistent
with the fastest growing magnetic eigenmode predicted by kinematic dynamo theory using a laminar
model of the mean ﬂow. Though the eigenmodes of the mean ﬂow are decaying, it is postulated
that turbulent ﬂuctuations of the velocity ﬁeld change the ﬂow geometry such that the eigenmode
growth rate is temporarily positive. Therefore, it is expected that a characteristic of the onset of a
turbulent dynamo is magnetic intermittency.

Determining the onset conditions for magnetic ﬁeld
growth in magnetohydrodynamics is fundamental to un-
derstanding how astrophysical dynamos such as the
Earth, the Sun, and the galaxy self-generate magnetic
ﬁelds. These onset conditions are now being studied in
laboratory experiments using ﬂows of liquid sodium [1].
The conditions required for generating a dynamo can be
determined by solving the magnetic induction equation

∂ B
∂t

= Rm∇ × V × B + ∇2B,

(1)

where B is the magnetic ﬁeld, V is the velocity ﬁeld
scaled by a characteristic speed V0, and the time is scaled
to the resistive diﬀusion time τσ = µ0σL2. The mag-
netic Reynolds number is Rm = µ0σLV0, where σ is
the conductivity of the ﬂuid and L is a characteristic
scale length [2].
In the kinematic approximation, the
velocity ﬁeld is assumed to be a prescribed ﬂow (either
the ﬂow is stationary or its time dependence is speci-
ﬁed) and Lorentz forces due to the magnetic ﬁeld are
neglected. Equation 1 is then linear in B and can be
solved as an eigenvalue problem. Several diﬀerent types
of stationary, helical ﬂows have been shown theoretically
to be kinematic dynamos [3, 4, 5, 6], which in turn has
lead to the design of current dynamo experiments. For
particular ﬂows, the kinematic model predicts a critical
value of the magnetic Reynolds number, Rmcrit, above
which the magnetic ﬁeld becomes linearly unstable, i.e.
for Rm > Rmcrit a small seed magnetic ﬁeld will grow ex-
ponentially in time. The dynamo onset conditions have
been tested in helical pipe-ﬂow experiments at Riga [7, 8]
and Karlsruhe [9, 10]. Both experiments generated mag-
netic ﬁelds at a value of Rmcrit consistent with predic-
tions from the kinematic theory.

Fluids and plasmas such as the Earth’s liquid core,
the solar convection zone, and liquid metals are turbu-
lent under the conditions required for a dynamo. The

Riga and Karlsruhe experiments use highly constrained
ﬂows to create the helical geometry necessary for mag-
netic ﬁeld generation. Astrophysical dynamos, however,
are often generated by ﬂows in simply-connected geome-
tries which do not exhibit the scale separation between
the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld and the ﬂuctuating part of
the velocity ﬁeld employed in the Riga and Karlsruhe ex-
periments. This discrepancy has prompted the creation
of several experiments to investigate the dynamo onset
conditions in simply-connected ﬂows with fully developed
turbulence [11, 12, 13].

The threshold for the dynamo instability is not ex-
pected to be the smooth transition from decaying to
growing magnetic ﬁelds described by laminar kinematic
theory [14]. Large-scale eddies can cause the instanta-
neous ﬂow to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the mean ﬂow. The
growth rate of the magnetic ﬁeld is highly sensitive to
the ﬂow geometry, and so the instantaneous ﬂow may

occasionally satisfy Rm > Rmcrit while the mean ﬂow
does not. The fastest-growing global magnetic eigen-
mode would then ﬂuctuate between growing and decay-
ing states. The threshold of magnetic ﬁeld growth there-
fore has a range characterized by intermittent bursts of
magnetic ﬁeld growth.
In this Letter the observation
of an intermittently excited magnetic ﬁeld in a simply-
connected, turbulent ﬂow of liquid sodium is reported.
The structure of the excited ﬁeld is consistent with the
largest growing magnetic eigenmode predicted from a
laminar kinematic model of the mean ﬂow.

The Madison Dynamo Experiment [Fig. 1]

is a
1 m diameter stainless steel sphere ﬁlled with liquid
sodium [15]. Results presented in this Letter are from a
turbulent two-vortex ﬂow, similar to the ﬂows described
in [6], created by two counter-rotating impellers. The
impellers are each driven by 75 kW motors and can
achieve rotation rates up to 25 Hz, corresponding to
Rmtip = µ0σLVtip = 150 based on the impeller tip speed.
The mean ﬂow is designed to generate growing mag-
netic ﬁelds according to a laminar kinematic dynamo
model [11]. According to the kinematic eigenvalue calcu-
lations, for suﬃciently large Rm the experimental ﬂow
is expected to excite a dipole magnetic ﬁeld oriented
transverse to the symmetry axis [Fig. 1]. An array of
74 temperature-compensated Hall probes on the surface
of the sphere provides measurements of the instantaneous
multipole structure of the magnetic ﬁeld induced by cur-
rents in the liquid sodium. The Hall probes are capable
of resolving changes in the magnetic ﬁeld down to 0.3 G
with a maximum range of ±170 G. A pair of magnetic
ﬁeld coils coaxial with the axis of rotation are used to
apply a nearly-uniform 50 G axial ﬁeld. This seed ﬁeld
brings the ﬁeld induced by the ﬂow above the noise level
of the Hall probes. The applied ﬁeld is suﬃciently small
that the strength of the Lorentz force is about 1% of ﬂuid
inertial forces.

ments. This snapshot of the measured ﬁeld corresponds to an
induced dipole ﬁeld transverse to the drive shaft axis.

The velocity ﬁeld of an identical-scale water model
of the experiment is measured using Laser Doppler
Velocimetry (LDV) [15]. The velocity measurements
have Gaussian probability distribution functions (PDF)
[Fig. 2(a)] as expected from a stationary turbulent ﬂow
according to the central limit theorem [16]. The mag-
netic ﬂuctuations measured near the axis of symme-
try of the sodium experiment also have Gaussian dis-

distributed ﬂuctuations, there are intermittent,
amplitude magnetic bursts observed on probes near the
equator of the experiment. The magnetic ﬁeld dur-
ing a burst has the spatial structure expected from the
least-damped magnetic eigenmode from kinematic the-
ory [Fig. 3]. The orientation of the transverse dipole is
random for each burst so that the time-averaged induced
ﬁeld is axisymmetric.

The averaged burst is used to calculate the growth rate and
burst width in Tab. I.

threshold is suﬃciently small to capture a large number
of bursts yet signiﬁcantly larger than the mean energy
(about two standard deviations above the mean energy
for each time series). The bursts are averaged together
and the growth rate is determined by an exponential
curve ﬁt [Fig. 5]. The results for various impeller rotation
rates are reported in Tab. I. It should be noted that the
strength of the ﬂuctuations in the ﬁeld is at most equal
to the on-axis applied ﬁeld strength of 50 G, hence the
Lorentz force due to the ﬂuctuations is weak compared
to inertial forces.

e

There are several possible mechanisms for the excita-
tion of the transverse dipole ﬁeld. Velocity ﬁeld ﬂuctu-
ations are large, with
V / hV i ≈ 0.5 as determined from
LDV measurements. These large ﬂuctuations cause the
peak ﬂow speed to vary, which can be interpreted as vari-
ation in Rm. Fluctuations at the largest scales can also
cause changes in the shape of the ﬂow leading to variation
of Rmcrit. The statistics of the small-scale ﬂuctuations
could change, also contributing to variation of Rmcrit.
If the kinetic helicity of the small-scale eddies becomes
suﬃciently strong, the net current generation could give
rise to the observed magnetic ﬁeld bursts [17, 18]. Re-
gardless of scale, subtle changes in the ﬂow can adjust
the instability threshold.

To estimate the likelihood the ﬂow is self-exciting, the
kinematic growth rate from the velocity ﬁeld measured

the ranges of Rm and Rmcrit.

in the water experiment is calculated [Fig. 6]. The solid
line shows the results of the calculation using the mean
ﬂow, whereas the dashed line shows the growth rate cal-
culated for an optimized ﬂow geometry similar to and
within the ﬂuctuation levels of the measured ﬂow [14].
The region between the growth rates of the mean and op-
timized ﬂows indicates the range of possible eigenmode
growth rates for an instantaneous realization of the ﬂow
and the resulting variation in Rmcrit.

The velocity ﬂuctuations also contribute to variations
in the instantaneous maximum speed of the ﬂow, thereby
creating a range of Rm. Probability distributions of
Rm constructed from the measured velocity ﬂuctuations
for three diﬀerent impeller rotation rates are plotted in
Fig. 6. It is expected that a greater overlap of the PDF of
Rm with the range of Rmcrit will result in magnetic ﬁeld
excitations with greater frequency and strength. The du-
ration of each excitation is expected to decrease since
the correlation time of the velocity ﬂuctuations scales as
τc ∼ ℓ/Vℓ where ℓ is the eddy scale length and Vℓ is
the characteristic speed of the eddy. For example, LDV
measurements from the water model give τc = 80 ± 20
ms for the ftip = 16.7 Hz ﬂow, consistent with eddies of
size ℓ = 0.25 m and speed Vℓ = 3 m/s. The proportion

of time that the magnetic ﬁeld is bursting is estimated
to be nd = fbτb, where fb is the average frequency of the
bursts and τb is the width of the conditionally-averaged
burst at half-maximum. The data in Tab. I show that
the proportion of time the ﬂow is bursting stays relatively
constant between 5–8%.

Table I reveals that the standard deviation of the en-
ergy in the intermittent transverse dipole ﬁeld is approxi-
mately equal to its mean value, a characteristic of a Pois-
son probability distribution [19]. Assuming each excita-
tion can be treated as a rare random event, the prob-
ability distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld energy can be
determined heuristically. The probability of measuring n
bursts in time t is given by P (t) = (fbt)ne−fbt/n! where
fb is the average rate of bursts. The average growth of the
magnetic ﬁeld over time t during a burst is ∆B = B0eλt,
where B0 is the average strength of the initial seed ﬁeld.
The resulting gain in the magnetic ﬁeld energy per unit
volume is ∆E = ∆B2/2µ0 = (B2
0 /2µ0) exp(2λt) and so
t = log(∆E/E0)/2λ where E0 = B2
0 /2µ0. Substituting
the time in terms of ∆E into the Poisson distribution
yields a log-Poisson distribution for the probability den-
sity of ∆E:

The probability distributions of the transverse dipole en-
ergy are shown in Fig. 7. The distributions with large
numbers of bursts tend to have signiﬁcantly more high
energy ﬂuctuations than is expected from Gaussian ﬂuc-
tuations. The overall invariance of the distributions as
the impeller rotation rate is increased demonstrates that
the increased frequency of bursts is oﬀset by their short-
ened duration.

The results presented demonstrate how turbulence in
a simply-connected geometry changes the onset condi-
tions of the dynamo. Rather than the smooth transi-
tion from damped to growing ﬁelds predicted by either
kinematic or mean ﬁeld dynamo theory, the transition is

characterized by intermittent magnetic ﬁeld bursts which
may be relevant to some dynamo models [20]. Although
sustained growth is not yet observed, the transient exci-
tation demonstrates the intermittent characteristics of a
turbulent dynamo.

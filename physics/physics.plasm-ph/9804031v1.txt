Abstract

The inﬂuence of motion of ions and electron temperature on nonlinear
one-dimensional plasma waves with velocity close to the speed of light in vac-
uum investigated. It is shown that although the wavebreaking ﬁeld weakly
depends on mass of ions, the nonlinear relativistic wavelength essentially
changes. The nonlinearity leads to the increase of the strong plasma wave-
length, while the motion of ions leads to the decrease of the wavelength. Both
hydrodynamic approach and kinetic one, based on Vlasov-Poisson equations,
are used to investigate the relativistic strong plasma waves in a warm plasma.
The existence of relativistic solitons in a thermal plasma is predicted.

I. INTRODUCTION

Strong plasma waves passing through a plasma with phase velocity slightly
smaller than the velocity of light are the subject of great interest during last
two decades. Such waves can be excited in plasma by relativistic bunches of
charged particles or laser pulses. The excited plasma waves can be used both
to accelerate charged particles and to focus charged bunches [1]. Plasma-
based accelerator concepts are currently under intensive development (see
overview in Ref. 2 and numerous references therein). Accelerating gradients
in the plasma wave can reach the value of tens GeV/m (notice that in con-
ventional linacs accelerating gradients are in order of 100 MeV/m), that is
conﬁrmed in recent experiments [2]. Also the focusing ﬁelds can be much
more than that reached in conventional focusing magnetic systems. The ac-
celeration of charged particles by relativistic strong waves also is considering
as a possible mechanism of ultra-high energy (up to 1020 eV) cosmic rays
generation in astrophysical plasma.

In a cold plasma an amplitude of one-dimensional plasma wave is lim-
ited by the wavebreaking ﬁeld. In nonrelativistic case, when the wave phase
velocity vph is much less than velocity of light (vph ≪ c), the wavebreaking
amplitude is equal to [3] E∗ = meωpevph/|e|, where ωpe = (4πn0e2/me)1/2 is
the electron plasma frequency, n0 is the density of electrons in unperturbed
plasma, me and e are the electron rest mass and their charge; the ions as-
sumed to be immobile. In relativistic case the wavebreaking ﬁeld is equal to
[4] Erel = [2(γ − 1)]1/2/β, here β = vph/c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2 is the relativistic
factor and Erel is normalized on E∗. The 1D relativistic strong waves (RSW)
can be excited in a plasma by wide relativistic bunches of charged particles
or intensive laser pulses [2] (when kpa ≫ 1, where kp = ωpe/vph, a is the
characteristic transverse sizes of bunches or pulses).

The another important characteristic of nonlinear plasma waves is the
dependence of the wavelength on the wave amplitude. Both in linear case
and in nonlinear nonrelativistic one, the plasma wavelength in cold plasma is
λp = 2πvph/ωpe. In the relativistic nonlinear regime, when plasma electrons
get a relativistic velocity in the process of oscillations, nonlinear wavelength
increases with the amplitude [5-8]. In the relativistic case (γ ≫ 1), for the
∼= Erel, the wavelength approximately is equal to [5]
wave amplitude Emp
4(2γ)1/2λp. One can see that for large γ the wavelength is essentially more
than usual linear plasma wavelength.

2

In the previous studies the plasma ions, in the process of oscillations, in-
cluding the nonlinear relativistic waves, usually were assumed to be immobile
due to their large mass. In Ref. 9 it is shown that when γ ≪ (M/16me)1/3
(here M is mass of an ion; for example, for hydrogen plasma, consisting of
protons and electrons, this condition gives γ < 5), the wavebreaking ampli-
tude approximately is equal to Erel and the motion of ions can be neglected.
However, the dispersion properties of the relativistic strong plasma waves,
which takes into consideration the motion of ions, not elucidated up to now.
This problem has considered in Sec. II on the base of cold hydrodynamics
equations for the arbitrary γ and mass of particles forming the plasma. The
necessity to take into account the ion motion conditioned by the following
reasons. Firstly, because the maximum relativistic wavelength and amplitude
grow proportional to γ1/2, the plasma ions (even heavy ions) in such strong
ﬁeld can get velocity which is suﬃcient to give contribution in the process
of charge separation in the wave. On the other hand, in a semiconductor
plasma positively-charged particles (holes) have a mass similar or less than
that of electron. The problem has also astrophysical aspect. The pole region
of the pulsars is considered to be ﬁlled with an electron-positron plasma in
which the strong plasma waves can be excited and high energy charged parti-
cles generated [10]. It is obvious that in the plasma wave passing through an
electron-positron plasma, neither electrons nor positrons may be considered
as neutralizing background.

Another important problem is the inﬂuence of plasma temperature on
RSW. Finite plasma temperature has decisive signiﬁcance for description of
RSW near ”wavebreaking”. Actually, according to 1D theory of relativistic
plasma waves in a cold plasma, at the ”breaking” point hydrodynamic plasma
electron velocity is equal to the phase velocity and the density of electrons ne
tends to inﬁnity [5-7] (in this case spatial behavior of the density is similar
to the δ-function). On the other hand, in a thermal plasma (even when the
temperature is small), the pressure tends to inﬁnity when ne → ∞. Thus, in
this case, the pressure, as well as the plasma temperature, should be taken
into consideration. In Ref. 12, the ﬁnite plasma temperature eﬀect on non-
relativistic (vph ≪ c) wavebreaking ﬁeld considered using 1D waterbag model
for the distribution function. In this model it is assumed, that the electron
distribution function during oscillations is constant in a limited interval of
velocities and is equal to zero outside of this interval. It is shown [12] that
maximum amplitude of the plasma waves decreases with the temperature.

3

In Ref. 13 the 1D relativistic waterbag model used to investigate RSW in a
warm plasma. Using relativistic equation of motion with the pressure term
for plasma electrons, in Ref. 11 is shown that in the case γ ≫ mev2
ph/3T
(where T is the temperature of electrons) the wavebreaking ﬁeld is propor-
tional to T −1/4. The authors of Ref. 14 have analyzed the inﬂuence of low
temperature (T ≪ mec2) on excitation of nonlinear wake ﬁelds by a relativis-
tic charged bunches. They considered the equation of motion obtained using
second moments of the distribution function. In the present paper (Sec. III)
this equation used for simulation of RSW in a warm plasma. In Sec. IV the
properties of the strong plasma waves investigated on the base of relativistic
Vlasov kinetic equation and the Poisson equation.

II. ION MOTION EFFECT ON THE DISPERSION
PROPERTIES OF RELATIVISTIC STRONG PLASMA WAVES

In this section we consider a cold uniform plasma consisting of positively-
charged particles (for example, protons or positrons) with mass m+ and
electric charge q+ and negatively-charged particles (electrons or negatively-
charged ions) with mass m− and the charge q−. From the relativistic equation
of motion and the continuity equation for each plasma components and the
Poisson equation one can obtain the following equation for one-dimensional
steady plasma waves:

d2Φ
dz2 + β3γ2[

(Φ2

(1)

where Φ ≡ Φ− = 1+|q−|ϕ/m−c2 ≥ 1/γ, Φ+ = 1−q+ϕ/m+c2 = 1+µ(1−Φ) ≥
1/γ, where µ = |q+/q−|m−/m+, ϕ is the electric potential, z = kp(Z − vpht),
kp = ωp/vph, ωp = (4πn0−q2
−/m−)1/2, n0− is the density of negatively-charged
particles in equilibrium. The electric potential ϕ is assumed to be equal to
zero when plasma density is equal to the equilibrium density. Velocity of
plasma particles normalized to the velocity of light and their density normal-
ized to the equilibrium value one ﬁnd from the expressions:

β+,− = [β − (Φ2

+,−),

N+,− = βγ2[Φ+,−/(Φ2

The electric ﬁeld strength normalized to the nonrelativistic wavebreaking
ﬁeld m−ωpvph/|q−|, obeys the formula

Equation (1) can be rewritten in the form

E(z) = −(1/β2)dΦ/dz.

Here, for convenience, U(Φ) chosen to be equal to zero in a point Φ = 1, where
it reaches a minimum. When µ → 0, Eq. (1) reduces to the known equation
for nonlinear waves in a plasma with immobile ions [2,7]. Formally, Eq. (5)
describes the one-dimensional motion of a particle in a ﬁeld with potential
U(Φ); the values Φ and E correspond to the coordinate and velocity of this
ﬁctitious particle respectively. Function U determines the characteristic of
the ﬁeld moving through the plasma. In Fig. 1 this function presented for
γ = 10 (β ≈ 0.995) and diﬀerent values of µ. One can see that for the
arbitrary parameters, the solutions of Eq. (5) [or Eq. (1)] are the periodic
plasma waves (including the wave with zero amplitude-unperturbed plasma).
Integrating Eq. (5) we have

dΦ
dz

= −β2E = ±[2(Umax − U)]1/2,

(6)

where Umax is maximum value of U(Φ) in the process of oscillations. From
(6) follows that the plasma wave amplitude is equal to Emp = (2Umax)1/2/β2.
Substituting maximum permissible value of U(Φ), which reaching at Φ =
1/γ, in this expression, we ﬁnd the wavebreaking ﬁeld:

EW B = 21/2γ[1 + (1 − a

a1 = 1 + µ, a2 = 1 + µ(γ − 1)/(γ + 1).

In the case µ ≪ 1, from (7) follows the expression

EW B ≈ (1 + µ/8)[2(γ − 1)]1/2/β,

5

(4)

(5)

(7)

(8)

which reduces to the well known relativistic wavebreaking ﬁeld for plasma
with immobile ions, when µ = 0 [4]. Fig. 2 shows the wavebreaking ﬁeld EW B
depending on µ (for example, for electron-positron plasma µ = me/mpos = 1,
for the hydrogen plasma µ = me/mprot ≈ 5.455 × 10−4) for diﬀerent value
of γ. Both in nonrelativistic case and in relativistic one the wavebreaking
ﬁeld weakly increases with µ. For example, according to (7), in nonrelativis-
tic case (γ ≈ 1), EW B(µ = 1) only 2(1 − 2−1/2)1/2 ≈ 1.08 times exceeds
the wavebreaking amplitude at µ = 0. Proceeding from the shape of the
”potential” U(Φ) (see Fig. 1) one can expect that the plasma wavelength
undergoes considerable change with µ. In Fig. 3 the dependence of relativis-
tic plasma wavelength Λp [note, that according to the variables accepted in
(1), the linear plasma wave at µ = 0 corresponds to the value Λp = 2π] on
amplitude presented. The curve 1 corresponds to the case of immobile ions
and coincides with that previously obtained [7]; in this case Λp grows with
the amplitude due to relativistic velocities of the oscillating plasma particles
(notice, that in nonlinear nonrelativistic regime the plasma wavelength not
depends on amplitude). The motion of positive ions, for ﬁxed amplitude,
cause the decrease of charge separation length and therefore, leads to the de-
crease of the wavelength. Fig. 3 clearly shows competition of two tendencies.
For the small µ the wavelength grows with the amplitude due to nonlinearity.
With the increase of Emp, the eﬀect of ion motion becomes more essential.
When µ is not small, the behavior of the wavelength caused mainly by ion

with the increase of Emp, in contrast to the case of heavy ions (µ ≈ 0). The
results of simulations presented in Fig. 3 conforms with the well known result
of linear theory (Emp ≪ 1; see, e.g., Ref. [15]): Λp = Λp0/(1 + µ)1/2, where
Λp0 = Λp(µ = 0). Note also that the results practically not changed for
arbitrary γ ≫ 1. Considerable decrease of the relativistic plasma wavelength
with µ demonstrated in Fig. 4.

Previous studies have shown that energy of electrons (or positrons) ac-
celerated in the ﬁeld of relativistic nonlinear wave, in a cold plasma with
immobile ions, can reach a value of 4mec2γ3 [7,16]. In the general case the
relativistic factor of a resonant electron passing from a point with the dimen-
sionless potential Φ1 to a point with Φ2 is equal to [7]

γacc ≈ γacc(0) + 2γ2(Φ2 − Φ1),

(9)

6

where γacc(0) ≈ γ is value of the relativistic factor at the initial point. When
µ = 0, Φmin = 1/γ ≤ Φ ≤ Φmax ≈ 2γ [7]. Substituting this maximum and
minimum values in (9), for maximum energy of accelerated electrons one
obtain (γacc)max ≈ 4γ3. With µ growing, the maximum energy decreases due
to the decrease of Φmax (see Fig. 1). For the case of electron-positron plasma
function U(Φ) is symmetric with reference to axis Φ = 1 and, as it is easy to
see, in this case Φmin = 1/γ, Φmax = 2 − 1/γ. Then, the maximum energy of
accelerated particles is (γacc)max ≈ 4γ2, that is in γ times less than that in
the case µ = 0.

If a bunch of charged particles with density nb(z) and electric charge qb
passes through a plasma, adding to the left side of equation (1) the value
α(z) = β2(qb/|q−|)nb(z)/n0−, we obtain the equation that describes the ex-
citation of steady plasma wake ﬁelds by the bunch. In this case the phase
velocity is equal to velocity of bunch. In this section the properties of RSW
have investigated by simulation of wake wave generation by charged bunches.
Above we have considered the case µ ≤ 1. However, one can see that
the obtained results are valid also for µ > 1 if E replace by −E [this new
E is normalized to m+ωpvph/q+, ωp = (4πn0+q2
+/m+)1/2], µ replace by 1/µ,
replace the subscript ” + ” by ” − ” and vice versa.

III. THE INFLUENCE OF ELECTRON TEMPERATURE ON
RELATIVISTIC NONLINEAR PLASMA WAVES:
HYDRODYNAMIC APPROACH

Here we are continuing to consider the dispersion properties of RSW in the
frame of hydrodynamic approach, investigating relativistic nonlinear waves
in a warm plasma. Adding the relativistic pressure term to the equation of
motion of plasma electrons one can obtain the equation [14] (see also Ref.
[11]):

e )−1/2, κ = K3(1/τ )/K2(1/τ ), where
ature of plasma electrons, γe = (1 − β2

7

Kn(x) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the n-th order. The plasma ions are
assumed to be immobile due to their large mass. The density of electrons
Ne = ne/n0 normalized to the unperturbed value n0, as usually, is obtaining
from the continuity equation:

Ne = β/(β − βe).

(11)

When τ → 0 (κ → 1) equations (10) and (11) describe RSW in a cold plasma
[5,6]. Note that the value τ = 1 corresponds to the temperature of about
6×109 K. For laboratory plasmas the temperature changes in the bounds
τ ∼ 10−6 − 10−2; for star plasmas τ ∼ 10−5 − 1.

Substituting (4) and (11) in (10.1) and then integrating over z, one obtain

κγe(1−ββe)+τ {(γ/2) ln[(βγ+βeγe)(γ+γe)/(βγ−βeγe)(γ−γe)]−γe}−Φ = C,
(12)
where Φ = 1 + |e|ϕ/mec2, C is a constant determining from condition βe = 0
(γe = 1) at ϕ = 0. According to Eq. (12), when βe → β, the dimensionless
potential Φ diverges as τ ln[1/(βγ − βeγe)(γ − γe)]. Thus, in opposite to the
case of cold plasma, the relativistic wavelength in a warm plasma tends to
inﬁnity near the ”wavebreaking”. Hence, in latter case we have a solitary
plasma wave. Notice that in a cold plasma the maximum wavelength is pro-
portional to γ1/2 [5,11]. Fig. 5 shows the dependence of the wavelength on
wave amplitude in thermal plasma obtained by simulation of Eqs. (10) and
(11). In the case of low temperature (τ ≪ 1) this dependence almost coin-
cides with that in a cold plasma (compare curves 1 in Figs. 5 and 3). The
wavelength in warm plasma grows with the temperature, while the maxi-
mum of electron density in wave decreases. This conditioned by the thermal
pressure which increases with τ and obstructs to the charge separation. Evo-
lution of the electron density in a wave of ﬁxed amplitude presented in Fig.
6 for diﬀerent temperatures. When τ ≪ 1, in a wave with Emp > 1, the
electron density has sharp maximums, and is nearly equal to 1/2 out of the
maximums.

In the frame of hydrodynamic theory the velocity of plasma electrons
can not exceed the wave phase velocity. Actually, if βe > β, then, accord-
ing to expression (11), the density of electrons becomes negative, that has
not physical sense. In reality, when βe ≈ β in a warm plasma (even when
the temperature is small), considerable part of electrons get velocities more
than the phase velocity due to their thermal energy distribution. When the

8

temperature is not small, the energy distribution eﬀect on plasma waves is
essential in all cases. Therefore, the strong waves near the ”wavebreaking”
and when τ is not small, can be described correctly in the frame of kinetic
approach.

IV. KINETIC THEORY OF THE RELATIVISTIC STRONG
PLASMA WAVES

As in the previous section, here we assume the plasma ions to be immobile.
The kinetic approach, for 1D steady ﬁelds passing through a warm plasma,
gives the following system, obtained from relativistic Vlasov equation and
Maxwell equations (see, e.g., Ref. 17):

where p = pz is the plasma electron momentum, normalized to mec, f (p, z) is
the distribution function. In an unperturbed plasma the distribution function
is equal to 1D relativistic Maxwell distribution [18]

f0 = A[1 + (1 + p2)1/2/τ ] exp[−(1 + p2)1/2/τ ],
A = τ /2K2(1/τ ).

Solving Eq. (13) by the method of characteristics (see, e.g., Ref. 19) and
requiring that the function f reduces to the equilibrium distribution (16) at
Φ = 1, one obtain the following general solution:

(13)

f = A(1 + S/τ ) exp(−S/τ ),

r = βp − (1 + p2)1/2 + Φ − 1.

(15) and (17) in Eq.

In the expression for g, the plus sign corresponds to the case p ≤ βγ and the
minus sign to p > βγ; in equilibrium (Φ = 1) we have g = p. Substituting
Eqs.
(14) one obtain equation for Φ. The plasma
electron density Ne(Φ) obtained numerically from (15) and (17) is presented
In the case of a low temperature, the integral in (15) can be

calculated by the Laplace asymptotic method [18]. The value of Ne is at
maximum when Φ ≈ 1/γ and is equal to

Nmax ≈ [Γ(1/4)/4]γ(βγ/π)1/2(2/τ )1/4 ≈ 0.6γ(βγ)1/2τ −1/4.

(18)

According to expression (18), in a cold plasma Nmax → ∞, that conforms
with the previous investigations [5,6,11]. When τ ≪ 1 and Φ > 1/γ, the
dependence Ne(Φ) approximately describing by expression (3).

Simulations of the problem have showed that the plasma wavelength in-
creases with the wave amplitude and tends to inﬁnity for a solitary wave
(soliton). Fig. 8 shows dependence of the maximum value of the amplitude
(which corresponds to the maximum of electric ﬁeld strength in the soliton
Es) on plasma temperature for diﬀerent γ. One can see that Es is almost
constant and equal to the relativistic wavebreaking ﬁeld Erel for the values
of τ up to 0.05 − 0.1 and then decreases rapidly.

As have mentioned above, the relativistic plasma waves can be excited
by charged bunches or laser pulses. In order to describe the excitation of the
wake ﬁeld by a charged bunch, it is necessary to add in the left side of Eq.
[14] the value β2α(z) [the deﬁnition of α(z) see in Sec. II]. The nonlinear
periodical wave and the solitary wave excited by uniform electron bunch are
plotted in Fig. 9. The plasma electron density behind the soliton tends
to its equilibrium value (Ne → 1) and the electric ﬁeld strength tends to
zero. However, in this case, the average plasma electron momentum < p >=

not seem strange because the solitary wave can be considered as a wave
R
with inﬁnite wavelength. Hence, bulk motion of plasma electrons behind the
solitary wave takes place, while the plasma remains neutral. Equations (13)-
(16) have also non-periodical solutions. However, such solutions have not
physical sense [18] and should be considered in the frame of non-stationary
kinetic theory. Thus, in a thermal plasma with immobile ions, two kinds of
steady waves can exist: periodical waves and solitons.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The results presented in this paper supplement the theory of nonlinear
relativistic plasma waves, taking into consideration motion of ions and ﬁnite
plasma temperature. It is shown that the nonlinearity leads to the increase
of relativistic wavelength, while ion motion leads to the wavelength decrease.
For example, in electron-positron plasma the wavelength monotonously de-
creases as the amplitude increases. The relativistic wavebreaking ﬁeld weakly
depends on the ion mass.

Contrary to the case of cold plasma, in a warm plasma the relativistic
solitary waves (solitons) can exist. The plasma wavelength grows with the
amplitude faster in the warm plasma and tends to inﬁnity for the soliton. It
has been found that maximum electron density in the plasma wave decreases
with the temperature as T −1/4 and tends to inﬁnity in a cold plasma, that
was shown by previous investigations.

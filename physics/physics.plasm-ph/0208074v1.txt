The goal of the controlled thermonuclear fusion program is to make the energy source
that powers our Sun available to human society. Deep in the Sun’s interior, favorable condi-
tions for the quasi-stationary nuclear burning of the solar plasma prevail as a result of the
immense gravitational self-forces that keep this huge accumulation of matter together. Since
gravitational self-conﬁnement is not operative at the reactor and laboratory scale, alternate
means of conﬁnement have to be employed to achieve suﬃciently high plasma densities and
temperatures in a reactor. In the perhaps most prominent stationary fusion reactor scheme,
the tokamak, strong electric ring currents are induced in an electrically neutral plasma to
achieve axisymmetric magnetic self-conﬁnement in a rotationally invariant toroidal vessel
. In a torus with suﬃciently large major axis, such a magnetic self-conﬁnement mimics
T
gravitational self-conﬁnement on account of the Biot-Savart law, according to which in a
system of parallel current ﬁlaments all ﬁlaments attract each other magnetically with the
same force law as would be the case gravitationally in a system of parallel mass ﬁlaments.
What makes the magnetic forces more attractive (in the double sense of this phrase) than
1040v2/c2 for
gravity for laboratory purposes is their very much bigger coupling constant (
two electrons moving on parallel trajectories with speed v as measured in the laboratory;
note that the even stronger (v2/c2 is replaced by 1) electrostatic repulsive forces between the
same two electrons are very eﬀectively screened in a neutral plasma and are traditionally
neglected to a good approximation). Of course, the analogy does not extend to all aspects
of plasma self-conﬁnement.
In particular, the solenoidal-vectorial character of stationary
current densities necessitates the toroidal topology of magnetic self-conﬁnement, whereas
gravity not only allows but manifestly prefers spherical conﬁnement over toroidal. Unfortu-
nately, axisymmetric toroidal magnetic self-conﬁnement is not known for its stability either.
Although major eﬀorts are devoted to the stabilization of the plasma conﬁguration, a vast
reservoir of instabilities capable of destroying the conﬁnement has dramatically slowed down
the development of a operating tokamak fusion reactor.

≈

Matters are not exactly helped by the fact that our theoretical understanding of the
physics on the various space-time scales that govern magnetic plasma conﬁnement is still
quite incomplete.
In particular, while the solenoidal character of the magnetic induction
together with the axisymmetry and stationarity of the law of momentum balance tell us that
the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function Ψ and the toroidal current density j must satisfy some
(Ψ, j, r) = 0 (in which r is the cylindrical distance from the axis
local functional relation
of symmetry) which turns Ampere’s law into some in general nonlinear elliptic partial diﬀer-
ential equation for Ψ (known in the fusion literature as the Grad–Shafranov equation), the
). Some information
actual relation
about
should be contained in the law of energy balance between current drive (through
an applied toroidal emf and other means), ohmic heating and, ultimately, radiation losses.
Unfortunately only the so-called classical and neo-classical transport coeﬃcients have been
computed in some detail [1] whereas the small scale turbulent dissipation mechanisms in a
tokamak plasma remain a largely challenging open problem. In this situation, theoreticians

ical stability analysis, based mostly on macroscopic magnetoﬂuid theory and mesoscopic
kinetic theory, is applied to sort out unstable conﬁgurations. While this approach has
met with a certain limited success, one does not learn what the approximations are ap-
proximate to. Over the years a number of plasma theorists [3] have argued that an equi-
librium thermodynamics-inspired maximum entropy principle with a few global dynamical
constraints1 should give answers close to the truth. In essence the various formulations in

Since in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics the maximum entropy principle has not
acquired a status anywhere near as fundamental as in equilibrium statistical mechanics, it is
mandatory to register some arguments in its favor for the case at hand. Thus, the relation
j
exp(Ψ) has been shown to be almost universally singled out also by a truly dissipative
Fokker–Planck approach to stationary magnetically conﬁned plasma [4, 5]. The perhaps most
compelling reason to give it serious considerations, however, is the successful application of
the maximum entropy approach to the physically distinct but mathematically quite similar
problems of stationary planar incompressible ﬂows,2 where the vorticity plays a rˆole closely
analogous to the current density in the plasma torus, and the strongly magnetized pure
electron plasma in a circular cylinder,3 where the charge density plays that rˆole.
In this
spirit, we have conducted a thorough investigation of the thermodynamic-type maximum
entropy approach to the magnetically self-conﬁned stationary plasma torus [5].

1Since any probability density maximizes the entropy relative to itself, a stationary plasma torus is
necessarily a maximum entropy conﬁguration under some constraints. What makes the maximum entropy
proposal non-empty is the insistence on only a few global natural dynamical constraints.

2The ﬁrst qualitative predictions based on statistical mechanics of the Hamiltonian system of N point
vortices were made in [6]. The quantitative evaluation began with [7]; impressive agreement with simulated
ﬂows is reported in [8]. Its mathematical rigorous foundations are by now almost complete, the latest word
being [9]; see [10] for a review. More recently a formulation based directly on continuum vorticity has gained
much ground; see [11] for a state-of-the-arts report.

3In the guiding center approximation the dynamics of this plasma system is identical to that of N point
vortices [12]. Statistical mechanics in the corotating frame predicts that at high enough eﬀective energies
the nonlinear m = 1 diocotron mode has higher entropy than any other conﬁguration with the same energy
and angular momentum [13], in accordance with remarkable real experiments [14].

A most curious ﬁnding of the study [5] is that the gravity-inspired toroidal magnetic
plasma self-conﬁnement scheme inherits from the stars their gravo-thermal negative speciﬁc
heat.4 This result is a little surprising, for it follows from what we said earlier that the
plasma torus should actually more closely mimic a cylindrical caricature of a star, and the
speciﬁc heat of a ‘cylindrical maximum entropy star’ [20] and its plasma physical clone, the
cylindrical Bennett pinch [21], is non-negative! The existence of a maximum entropy plasma
torus with negative speciﬁc heat is therefore a truly nontrivial fact. The purpose of this note
is to point out some potentially important consequences of our ﬁnding for plasma physical
applications.5 To pave the way for the discussion we ﬁrst describe the model and our results.

The model
Since the whole problem is rotationally invariant, we work with conventional cylindrical
coordinates r, θ, z. The magnetic induction ﬁeld decomposes accordingly as B = BT + BP ,
eθ. In an actual tokamak, the toroidal component BT and a part, B0,
where BT k
of the poloidal component are externally generated harmonic ﬁelds that serve the purpose of
azimuthal and radial stabilization. The total poloidal induction BP =
θ is the sum
of B0 and a component which is generated by the electric plasma current density vector, jeθ,
via the toroidal Amp´ere’s law

In a similar manner one decomposes the electric ﬁeld, E = ET + EP , where ET is driving
E = 4πρ,
the plasma current while the poloidal part is determined by Coulomb’s law
where ρ is the electric charge density. Usually the so-called quasi-neutrality approximation
is invoked, which determines the poloidal electric ﬁeld in leading order through a singular
perturbative approach to Coulomb’s law. To keep matters as simple as possible, we consider
an ‘electron-positron’ plasma, which is totally charge symmetric with regard to the particle
4Ref. [15], pp. 60-63, explains why a homogeneous piece of “everyday matter” must have positive speciﬁc
heat. See p. 62 of the same reference for why those arguments do not rule out negative speciﬁc heat in
an isolated gravitating system. Indeed, the virial and the equipartition theorems imply that in a spherical
equilibrium system the energy is distributed -2:1 between gravitational and kinetic. A decrease in total energy
E of a gravitational equilibrium gas ball will increase its thermal energy. Such a system grows hotter while
losing energy through, say radiation. Negative speciﬁc heat in self-gravitational perfect gases is evaluated
quantitatively already in [16] and is further discussed in [17]; however, none of these conﬁgurations with
negative speciﬁc heat is thermodynamically stable though some are metastable. Thermodynamically stable
self-gravitating conﬁgurations with negative speciﬁc heat can occur when the Newtonian
1/r singularity is
stabilized either as in quantum mechanics [18] or in classical hard balls systems [19].

5Recently, the existence and importance of negative speciﬁc heat was also reported for the diocotron mode
of the guiding center plasma [13] alias point vortex gas, and for certain vorticity structures in geostrophic
ﬂows [11, 22]. However, very diﬀerent from the gravo-thermal type negative speciﬁc heat that we report here
to be a characteristic also of the magnetically self-conﬁned plasma torus, the negative speciﬁc heat of these
quasi-particle systems does not couple to the thermal motion of the underlying physical particle systems,
which is evident from the fact that these quasi-particle systems also exhibit negative temperature [6].

species so that ρ vanishes exactly. In that case the poloidal electric ﬁeld vanishes identically,
too, while the toroidal one is implicitly contained in the electric plasma current I = Nqω/2π.
Here N is total number of plasma particles, q the elementary charge, and ω the mean absolute
angular frequency of a species. This settles the electromagnetic part of the model, and we
turn to the statistical mechanics part.

While most works in [3] are formulated at the macroscopic magnetoﬂuid level, they can in
essence be recovered from the statistical mechanics approach of Kiessling et al. in [3], which
begins with the Hamiltonian N particle formulation and takes the kinetic limit. At this
kinetic level, the plasma particles are described by distribution functions on single-particle
phase space. We seek those distribution functions which maximize the familiar Boltzmann
entropy functional under the constraints that the two separating integrals of motion, particle
number and energy, take prescribed values N and E, and given that the plasma carries a
prescribed electric current I. Since the current is not a separating integral, one has to resort
to a ruse and prescribe each species’ canonical angular momentum, which in the axisym-
metric kinetic limit is a separating integral, and subsequently pass from this microcanonical
angular momenta ensemble to its canonical convex dual, characterized by prescribed ω, viz.
I. The solutions of the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations for this variational prin-
ciple are also stationary solutions to the axisymmetric kinetic equations of Vlasov. Over
velocity space the resulting distribution functions are simply rigidly rotating Maxwellians
with temperature T = (kBβ)−1 > 0, tied to the energy constraint, and angular frequen-
I), microcanonically tied to the angular momentum constraints but canonically
cies
prescribed. This allows one to explicitly integrate over the velocity space to retain only
the eﬀective macroscopic entropy principle for the total number density of plasma particles,
n(x) = n(r, z), which in our charge symmetric plasma is just twice the value of the com-
mon space-dependent Boltzmann factor of each species’ distribution function. In eﬀect this

6The negative sign in front of the magnetic energy in W is due to the canonical constraint of prescribed

thermal system in the co-rotating frame, see Landau-Lifshitz (op. cit., pp. 71-73). Incidentally, those very
centrifugal contributions to W are negligible in our plasma and have been omitted. Moreover, the toroidal
ﬁeld BT does not show since we consider only axisymmetric conﬁgurations with toroidal current density.

a variant of Moser’s corollary [23] of the Trudinger–Moser inequality it can be shown that
given I, the entropy functional S(n) takes its ﬁnite maximum on the set of non-negative
axisymmetric densities n(x) = n(r, z) satisfying
= N > 0 and W (n) = E, and
the maximizer is a regular solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation.7 We remark that more
than one maximizing density function n might exist, and in addition the nonlinear Euler–
Lagrange equation may have other types of solutions. We call a solution S stable if it is a
global maximizer of the entropy (for the given constraints), S meta-stable if it is merely
a local maximizer, and unstable otherwise. Of course, only those S stable solutions which
exhibit magnetic self-conﬁnement are of interest.

standard Runge-Kutta solver ﬁnds the unique nontrivial solution at κ = κ1 = 1.62, giving
E1 = 2.72 W•, with W• = 2π2riI 2/25c2. Numerical solutions of (4), with ri = 1, ro = √2, and
H = 2, were then computed with a well-tested bifurcation code [26], based on a continuation
method [27]. Our code reproduced the analytical sheet pinch solution and its ﬁrst bifurcation
point in excellent agreement with our independently obtained semi-analytical results. We
then numerically followed the ﬁrst bifurcating branch that emerges from ψ1 to nonlinear
amplitudes, where it develops into a toroidal ring pinch with a double X magnetic structure
similar to the double X structure in the PDX-PBX Tokamak experiment in Princeton.9
Retrospectively, this vindicates our choice of boundary conditions.

conﬁguration consists of a highly concentrated ring pinch which, in rescaled coordinates
centered at the density maximum, converges to Bennett’s cylindrical pinch [21] as W (n)

ց
. On the basis of this evidence we surmise that the ring pinch has maximum entropy
−∞
for all W (n) < E1, implying its S stability in the class of rotationally invariant plasma with
eﬀective energy W (n) < E1 and current I. We remark that the ﬁrst bifurcation oﬀ of the
toroidal sheet pinch into the S stable toroidal ring pinch branch is then a symmetry-breaking
second-order phase transition.

It remains to determine the speciﬁc heat of the conﬁgurations, which we recall is neg-
atively proportional to the second derivative of S with respect to E. Thus we inspect the
curvature of the graphs of the entropy as function of energy for the various solutions, given
in Fig. 2. The graph representing the sheet pinch is concave. However, the graph for the ring

pinch is manifestly convex over the whole computed range of energies
We were also able to prove the convexity analytically to second order in perturbation theory
away from the bifurcation point. This conﬁrms what we have announced earlier: the speciﬁc
heat of the ring pinch is negative!

−

(FIG. 2)

Discussion
At last, we discuss the potential implications that our ﬁnding of gravo-thermal type negative
speciﬁc heat has for the problem of toroidal magnetic self-conﬁnement of plasma.
In a
gravitationally bound plasma, negative speciﬁc heat on one hand aids the ignition of nuclear
burning in a proto-star by heating it up when it loses energy by radiation, but it is also
responsible for some more spectacular instabilities once the nuclear burning expires, like the
onset of the red giant structure [17]. It would be intriguing enough if the negative speciﬁc
heat of a magnetically self-conﬁned plasma torus should be conﬁrmed to aid the ignition
of nuclear burning in a tokamak. For this to be so, one would have to be able to hold N
and I ﬁxed and secure the toroidal invariance (which is what one wants to achieve anyhow),
while E would have to decrease (the plasma radiation would seem to help in this respect)
slow enough so that one would essentially evolve along the ring pinch branch in Fig.2 to the
left, thereby heating up the plasma while pinching it more strongly. This would not seem
unwelcome. For now, however, energy leakage by radiation is a serious problem, while at the
same time the emf current drive leads to yet uncontrolled ohmic heating of the plasma. In
this case where E is allowed to ﬂuctuate too widely, the negative speciﬁc heat will have a very
unwanted eﬀect on the conﬁnement. This can be illustrated by considering the temperature
rather than energy E to be controlled by the competition of ohmic heating and radiation
(still assuming N and I ﬁxed, and toroidal invariance). In that case the canonical ensemble
determines the stability. But microcanonical and canonical ensembles are not equivalent
when the microcanonical one exhibits states with negative speciﬁc heat [18, 9, 28, 22], and
sure enough, none of the computed ring pinches with negative speciﬁc heat minimizes the

Actually, F is unbounded below for these β, N and I values, any minimizing sequence
concentrating on a singular ring current; cf.
[29] for a good discussion of the translation-
invariant analog. Of course, a real plasma would not get anywhere near such a singular ring
current conﬁguration, for a highly concentrated plasma ring is known to be susceptable to
magnetoﬂuid dynamical instabilities that destroy the axisymmetry.
Conclusion
To summarize, the S stable ring pinches have negative speciﬁc heat of the gravo-thermal
type and will therefore be stable if and only if N, E, and I are essentially ﬁxed and the
toroidal invariance is secured, in which case the negative speciﬁc heat may aid the ignition
of thermonuclear burning. The “if” part is good news; the bad news is the “only if” part.

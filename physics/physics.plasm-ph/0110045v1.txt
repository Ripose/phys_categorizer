Gravity compensation in dusty-plasmas by application of a temperature gradient

Micron sized particles can be suspended or even lifted up in gas by the thermophoretic eﬀect.

This has many applications in physics and technology.

Thermophoresis in context with dusty plasma was ad-
dressed by Jellum et al. [1], Havnes et al. [2] and Brattli
and Havnes [3]. The present work is diﬀerent in that
a temperature gradient is applied from outside. It can
be made much larger than intrinsic gradients which may
exist due to the electric discharge. For micron sized par-
ticles gravity can be compensated or even overcome by
thermophoresis. By a precise temperature measurement
and the calibration with the particle weight thermophore-
sis can be examined quantitatively.

In order to make the thermophoresis plausible, we re-

visit the gaskinetic understanding of heat conduction:

P
A

f

∆W =

3 kλ

f

dT

P is the thermal power ﬂowing through an area A per-
pendicular to the temperature gradient, f is the collision
frequency, k is the Boltzmann constant, λ is the mean
free path length, and ∆W the average diﬀerence in ki-
netic energy of atoms moving with the temperature gra-
dient and reverse. A lower limit for the thermophoretic
pressure follows from the inelastic momentum transfer:

F
A

f

∆M =

∆M is the average momentum diﬀerence, m the atomic
mass, and v is the average thermal velocity. Dividing
the equations we get the ratio between heat ﬂow and
thermophoretic force:

Λ is the heat conduction coeﬃcient. Using eqs. 2, 3 we
redeﬁne the thermophoretic pressure

and multiply with the cross-section of the particle Ap to
get the thermophoretic force:

The minus sign indicates a force directed towards de-
creasing temperature. With A = πr2

particle radius, the thermophoretic force becomes:

which diﬀers from eq. 6 only by 20 %. A work by Talbot
et al.
[5], most frequently referred to, presents exactly
this formula. Waldmann [4] refers to an even earlier dis-
cussion by Einstein [6] estimating the terminal velocity
of a sphere moved by the thermal gradient in a gas:

Inserting the average thermal velocity

The thermophoretic force can be derived now from the
heat conduction formula:

p is the gas pressure. The Epstein formula [7] can be
used to translate velocity into a thermophoretic force:

F =

which agrees with eq. 6 for the accommodation parame-
ter a = 0. Elastic momentum transfer or some empirical
a > 0 could at most double the thermophoretic force. Λ
for gases is taken e.g. from [8]:

Λ = 2.4 ηcv = 1.2 nvkλ

The statistical factors apply for atomic gases. η is vis-
cosity, cv speciﬁc heat, n and λ are given below. With
Λ inserted, the thermophoretic force comes into a form
which can be examined by measurement:

F =

Havnes et al.

[2] come to a diﬀerent result either as-

suming elastic collision or using a diﬀerent value for Λ:

F =

As the number density n is proportional to pressure
while the mean free path length λ is inversely propor-
tional, nλ is the same for any pressure. Therefore both
heat conduction and thermophoretic force are pressure
independent. In fact

nλ =

where σ is the atom to atom gas-kinetic cross-section
(table I) and √2 is a correction necessary to account
for thermal movement of the atoms. For a given tem-
perature gradient thermophoresis is strongest for Helium
and weakest for Xenon (table I). With eq. 9 the ther-

Measurements with discharge oﬀ and on

The experiments were done in a completely sym-
metrical RF-excited plasma chamber with a volume of
400 cm3, designed originally for zero-gravity research in
space. It was heated from below and cooled from above
by Peltier elements.

With the gas discharge switched oﬀ, the temperature
diﬀerence was raised until injected particles could be kept
ﬂoating. Temperatures above and below were measured
using platinum resistors. Equilibrium was found at 53
and 22 C, respectively. For the experimental parameters
(Table II) equations 8 or 10 predict a thermophoretic

The weight of the particle is 2.98

formula underestimates the thermophoretic force mod-
erately as expected. Whether the diﬀerence could be of
systematic nature will be discussed below.

The comparison between calculated (table I) and mea-
sured (table II) Λ for Argon shows the same circumstance
that theory underestimates. The measured Λ inserted

into eq. 6 results in a thermophoretic force of 3.44

The factor 2.26 summarizes statistical factors. It could
be replaced by an empirical factor determined by mea-
surement. Only the asymptotic case was considered so
far where the temperature gradient and collision frequen-
cies remain homogeneous in the vicinity of the ﬂoating
particle. This is true if the particle radius is much smaller
than the mean free path length λ and the temperatures of
particle and gas are in equilibrium. For other conditions,
we refer to [5].

For the discharge on ﬁgure 1 shows the usual condition
where the particle cloud settles down above the lower
electrode due to gravity. A strong electric ﬁeld in the
space charge region above the electrode keeps the neg-
atively charged particles suspended about 3 millimeters
above the surface. There is no convection obvious from
inspection of the suspended microparticles.

With the vertical temperature gradient of 1033 K/m
active, the particle cloud ﬁlls the volume between the
upper and lower sheath region (ﬁg. 2).

At twice the RF-power and the temperature gradient
raised to 1220 K/m, the void increases such that the
dust gets separated into isolated regions at the upper and
lower electrode. Crystallization takes place now on both
sides. The outside pressure required for crystallization

transfer between a ﬂowing medium and a surface and
d is a characteristic distance of the setup. N u gives a
ratio between total heat transport (conduction plus con-
vection) and conduction only. For negligible convection
it should approach unity. For natural convection N u is
a function of Grashoﬀ number Gr times Prandtl number
P r. Both are dimensionless. For gases P r is pressure
invariant and has a value of 0.48 for Argon [12]:

l is a characteristic length of the apparatus, g is the free

viscosity and ∆T is a characteristic temperature diﬀer-
ence. The Nusselt number does not lead any further un-
less the function f (0.48

ment in similar geometry or from a solution of the heat
transfer equations. We alternatively estimate the veloc-
ity of the largest possible toroidal vortex in the chamber.

M and V are the total mass and volume of the upward
moving part of the vortex, ∆T is the eﬀective tempera-

ber density of gas atoms at reference pressure p0 = 105
Pa and p the actual gas pressure. The counteracting force
is friction on the chamber walls:

F = ηvc

(13)

η is the viscosity of the gas, vc is the velocity of the vor-
tex at the wall boundary. A is the surface and z is the
the thickness of the boundary layer. The thermal lift de-
creases in proportion to the working pressure while the
friction remains unchanged as viscosity is the same for
all pressures. This is why natural convection is weak at
50 Pa.
(As the density ρ depends likewise on the gas
pressure, eq.11 indicates the same circumstance, provid-
ing f (0.48
Gr) depends with some exponent > 0 from
its argument.) Lift and friction, set equal and resolved
for the vc, give an estimate for the velocity of convection:

We take the surface of the chamber for A, 1/10 of the
chamber Volume for V , z=4mm, ∆T =20 K and ﬁnd a
velocity in the order of 1 mm/s.

The assumption of a homogeneous gradient deﬁned by
the temperature diﬀerence and the electrode distance is
not necessarily true. First, there is a boundary layer a
few times the free path lengths wide [2] where the veloc-
ity distribution is dominated by collisions with the wall.

the center by the discharge. (ﬁg. 3).

About convection and homogeneity in the
temperature gradient

At ambient pressure (105 Pa), convection would ob-
struct thermophoresis completely. Why is this not the
case at 50 Pa? The dimensionless Nusselt number N u =
α d/Λ = f (Gr
P r) describes the importance of con-
vection in the heat transfer. Λ is the heat conduction
coeﬃcient (eq. 7), α is a heat transfer coeﬃcient with

Solar cells: Both eﬃciency and long-term stability
of thin ﬁlm solar cells are enhanced by adding nanome-
ter sized silicon particles to the amorphous silicon ﬁlm
(Rocca et al.[14]). Thermophoresis can make the growth
process size-selective.

Hybrid integration: Thermophoresis could be used
for both levitation and movement in context with pick
and place technology (Wallace [15]), required where large
numbers of small units, (e.g. LEDs), must be placed on
highly integrated circuits.

This eﬀect can be safely neglected for most of the volume
of our chamber because the boundary layers are much
smaller than the electrode distance.

Second, cooling of the gas by thermal emission from
the particles [3] could be important. For emissivities ap-
proaching unity, heat transport by radiation would domi-
nate heat conduction. Between inﬁnite parallel plates the
solid angle towards the hot and cold boundary is the same
for all particle positions and the temperature of the par-
ticles becomes the same everywhere. For good thermal
coupling to the gas a minimum number density of parti-
cles is required. Radiation cooling can diminish both the
temperature gradient and the thermoporetic force. Emis-
sivities of both chamber and particle surfaces are smaller
than one and the measured force is somewhat stronger
than predicted. Nevertheless radiation cooling cannot be
ruled out completely on basis of our data.

Applications for the thermophoretic eﬀect

Apart from obvious applications, e.g. testing of space-
borne plasma instruments, study of the central void (ﬁg.
2), size selective particle production in a reactive plasma,
surface plating of particles, there are the following which
seem to be of special interest:

Adhesion in plasma crystals (Thomas and Morﬁll
[13]) is an open question. For a dust cloud trapped be-
low the upper electrode (ﬁg. 3), the ratio between gravity
and thermophoresis is in the hand of the experimenter.
Data can be collected with regard to binding energies in
a plasma crystal.

Space-charge dominated streamer discharges can emerge in free space from single electrons if
the electric ﬁeld exceeds a threshold value. We show that this threshold ﬁeld depends not only on
ionization and attachment rates and gap length as suggested by Meek’s criterion, but also on electron
diﬀusion. We present analytical and numerical results and derive explicit criteria for streamer
formation after the emergence of the ﬁrst free electron.

I. PROBLEM SETTING AND REVIEW

We investigate the conditions under which a tiny
ionization seed in a homogeneous electric ﬁeld grows
out into a streamer with self-induced space charge ef-
fects and consecutive rapid growth. Streamers in turn
play a role in creating the paths of sparks and light-
ning [1, 2], in high altitude sprite discharges above thun-
derclouds [3, 4, 5]. They are also used for various in-
dustrial applications [6], e.g. corona reactors for water
and gas treatment [7, 8, 9, 10], and sources of excimer
radiation for material processing [11, 12, 13]

In narrow geometries, streamers frequently are grow-
ing from pointed electrodes, that create strong local ﬁelds
in their neighborhood. At the electrodes, surface eﬀects
take place, and both positive and negative streamers can
emerge [14]. On the other hand, in many natural dis-
charges and,
in particular, for sprites above thunder-
clouds [5], it is appropriate to assume that the electric
ﬁeld is homogeneous and boundary eﬀects do not play a
role. Of course, dust particles or other nucleation cen-
ters can play an additional role in discharge generation,
but in the present paper we will focus on the eﬀect of a
homogeneous ﬁeld on a homogeneous gas. This assump-
tion corresponds to the case discussed previously, e.g., in
[15, 16, 17] and will be subject of the present paper.

Typically, the avalanche to streamer transition is as-
sumed to depend on the ionization rate α and gap length
d through the dimensionless combination αd. We here
ﬁrst recall this statement and then reinvestigate the prob-
lem and ﬁnd, that the transition depends also on electron
diﬀusion. This dependence is analyzed quantitatively in
full parameter space.

In detail, we consider a continuous discharge model
with attachment and local ﬁeld-dependent impact ioniza-
tion rate and space charge eﬀects. It is deﬁned through

Here ne, n+ and n− are the particle densities of elec-
trons, positive and negative ions, and E and Φ are the
electric ﬁeld and potential, respectively. De and νa are
the electron diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the electron attach-
ment rate. We assume the impact ionization rate α(E)
to be a function of the electric ﬁeld, and for our nu-
merical calculations, we use the Townsend approximation

negative ions are considered to be immobile on the time
scales investigated in this paper. The initial ionization
seed is placed in free space, and an electron avalanche
drifts towards the anode.

−

Eventually,

the charged particle density in the
avalanche will grow so large that space charge eﬀects
set in and change the externally applied ﬁeld, and a
streamer emerges from the avalanche. Essentially two
criteria have been given in the literature for this emer-
gence of a streamer from a tiny ionization seed. The ﬁrst
one is a necessary lower bound: the electric ﬁeld has to
be higher than the threshold ﬁeld Ek where the impact
ionization rate overcomes the attachment rate. Only for
E
> Ek, the ionization level can grow. Here Ek is de-

ﬁned through

µe Ek α(Ek) = νa.

The second criterion is known as Meek’s criterion. As
derived originally in [15], it states that for a cathode di-
rected (i.e., positive) streamer to emerge from an anode
directed avalanche, the system has to be long enough to
allow for a suﬃcient multiplication of the drifting elec-
tron package. Then the electric ﬁeld of the ions is high
enough for secondary emitted electrons at the anode to
drift towards the cathode. Typically, multiplication rates
by 8 [15, 18] to 9 [17] decades are assumed to be suﬃcient.
This ﬁxes the second criterion as

Meek’s criterion has been extended to the transition
of the avalanche to an anode directed (i.e., negative)
streamer [16, 17].

In the present paper we argue that for an avalanche
originating from a tiny local seed, this criterion is not
suﬃcient since it neglects the diﬀusion of the electron
package. Diﬀusion decreases the electron density while
impact ionization increases it.
In low ﬁelds, diﬀusion
stays dominant for all times which will always suppress
space charge eﬀects and consecutive streamer emergence.
The diﬀerence is particularly pronounced in non-
attaching gases like nitrogen. Here Meek’s criterion
would suggest that streamer formation could take place
as long as there is any impact ionization and the sys-
tem is suﬃciently long. However, electron diﬀusion will
suppress streamer formation in low ﬁelds.

We will elaborate this argument analytically and nu-
merically, and we will give quantitative corrections to
the above criteria. First the intrinsic scales of the prob-
lem with their explicit density dependence are identiﬁed
through dimensional analysis. Then analytical results
for the electron density are recalled and the electron in-
duced ﬁeld is calculated. This gives a lower bound for the
time and travel distance of avalanche-to-streamer transi-
tion. The ion density distribution cannot be calculated
analytically, however, we found that all spatial moments
of the distribution can be calculated. These moments
provide the basis for an estimate of the avalanche-to-
streamer transition. Fig. 4 summarizes how travel time
and distance at the transition depend on applied ﬁeld
and diﬀusion constant.

II. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

Meek’s criterion can be understood as an example of
E
dimensional analysis: the eﬀective cross-section α(
)
|
|
E
has the dimension of inverse length, hence α(
)d is a
|
|
dimensionless number that characterizes a certain behav-
ior. It is useful to extract the intrinsic scales also from
other quantities. In particular, there is another dimen-
sionless number in the problem, namely the dimension-
less diﬀusion constant

D =

Deα0
µeE0

,

(5)

that plays a distinctive role in the avalanche to streamer
transition as well. Note that this dimensionless diﬀusion
constant in general depends on temperature as De/µe
seems to be well approximated by the Einstein relation
De/µe = kT /e where k is Boltzmann’s constant and T
the temperature [16].

In general, lengths are measured in units of 1/α0, ﬁelds
in units of E0, and velocities in units of µ0E0 as in [19] —
hence diﬀusion should be measured in units of µeE0/α0
as done in (5). The parameters α0, µe, De and E0 depend

We neglect the eﬀect of photoionization as it is an in-
duced eﬀect of impact ionization. Therefore photoion-
ization rates are typically much lower than impact ion-
ization rates and do not contribute signiﬁcantly to the
build-up of a compact ionization seed that is required for
an avalanche to streamer transition.

, ν).
|

An initial ionization seed will under inﬂuence of the
background electric ﬁeld advect towards the anode, dif-
fuse and grow due to ionizing collisions with neutral
atoms. At the beginning of this process the inﬂuence
of space charges on the electric ﬁeld is negligible. We
can therefore analyze the continuity equations Eqs. (8)-
(9) in a homogeneous background ﬁeld E b, which makes
the process linear. Eventually space charges do aﬀect
the electric ﬁeld, and the streamer regime is reached.
Then charged layers emerge, shielding the interior of the
streamer from the outer electric ﬁeld. We here investi-
gate when this will happen.

III. ELECTRON DISTRIBUTION AND FIELD

A. Exact result for the electron distribution

We write the single electron that generates the

σ 

avalanche as a localized initial density

σ(r, τ = 0) = ρ(r, τ = 0) = σ0δ(r

r0)

(12)

−

and consider its evolution, in a cylindrically symmet-
ric coordinate system, under inﬂuence of a uniform ﬁeld
−Ebˆez, ˆez being the unit vector along the axial
E b =
direction.
To approximate the single electron, one has to take
σ0 = 10−4 at atmospheric pressure. Indeed the integra-
tion over the whole space of the initial electron density
distribution (12) is, obviously, equal to σ0. Using the
dimensional analysis introduced in previous section, this
corresponds to a total number of (σ0n0)/α3
0 electrons,
which is assumed to be unity (n0 being the characteris-
tic particle density, n0 = ǫ0α0E0/e). A substitution of
the numerical values for the intrinsic scales then leads to
σ0 = 10−4/(N/N0). For this initial condition, the elec-
tron evolution according to Eq. (8) can be given explicitly
as [16]

σ(r, τ ) = σ0 ef τ e−(r−r0−Ebτ )

it has the form of a Gaussian package that drifts with
Eb, widens diﬀusively with half width propor-
velocity
tional to √4Dτ , and carries a total number of electrons
ef τ . (If the initial ionization seed consists of several elec-
trons in some close neighborhood, the Gaussian shape is
approached nevertheless for large times due to the central
limit theorem.)

It should be noted that while the total number of elec-
trons in the package grows exponentially in time, the
maximum of the electron density

ﬁrst decreases until τ = 3/(2f ) and then increases. At
this moment of evolution, generation overcomes diﬀusion.

B. Exact result for the electron generated ﬁeld Eσ

While density and ﬁeld of the ions can only be calcu-
lated approximately and will be treated in the next sec-
tion, the electric ﬁeld E σ generated by the Gaussian elec-
tron package can be calculated exactly. The main point
is that the electron density distribution (13) is spher-
ically symmetric about the point r0 + E bτ . The elec-
tric ﬁeld E σ(s, τ ) induced by the electrons at the point

ION DISTRIBUTION AND FIELD

The electric ﬁeld generated by the electrons leads to
a ﬁrst estimate for the avalanche to streamer transition.
Actually, the magnitude of the monopole ﬁeld
Eσ ahead
of the electron cloud is an upper bound for the magni-
tude of the ﬁeld created by the dipole of electrons on the
one hand and the positive charges left behind by the elec-
tron cloud on the other hand (see lower panel in Fig. 1).
Therefore, substantial ﬁelds arise after a shorter travel
time τ0 and distance, so that τ0 is a lower bound for the
time τa→s of the avalanche-to-streamer transition.

The space charge generated ﬁeld is measured relative
to the externally applied ﬁeld Eb as

a full simulation of the continuity equations (8)-(9) to-
gether with the Poisson equation (10) [23, 24]. Though
the qualitative features of the transition time are well re-
produced, this ﬁgure shows that the underestimation of
the transition time is signiﬁcant, and that it is necessary
to include the ﬁeld of the ion trail left behind by the
electrons.

To get a more accurate estimate for the avalanche-to-

These moments mean that the center of mass of the

The ion cloud shows a more complex behavior; it is
evaluated close to the avalanche-to-streamer transition
where f τ = αd = O(10), therefore the terms of order
e−f τ are neglected.

First it is remarkable that the center of mass of the
ion cloud shifts with precisely the same velocity as the
electron cloud though the ion motion is neglected while
the electrons drift, and that the ion center of mass is
Eb/f behind the
at an approximately constant distance
electron center of mass. This distance

ℓα = Eb
Eb)
f (

=

α0
α(Eb)

in dimensionless units corresponds to ionization length
1/α(Eb).

The square of the radial width of the ion cloud 2D(τ
−
1/f ) is 2D/f smaller than the one of the electron cloud.
This is clear since the electron cloud also was more nar-
row when it left the ions behind. The ion cloud is more
extended in the z direction. More precisely, its length is
ℓα larger than its width. This comes from the ions be-
ing immobile, therefore a trace of ions is left behind by
the electron cloud. Moreover, it can be remarked that
the diﬀerence between the width and the length of the
ion cloud is the same as the distance between the centers
of mass of the ion and the electron cloud, namely the
ionization length ℓα.

C. An estimate for the transition

One can assume as in [17] that the ions have a distri-
bution similar to the electrons, thus a Gaussian with the
same width as the electron cloud, but centered around

are the distances to the electron and ion centers of mass.
E1 can not be computed
analytically. However, in Fig. 1 it can be seen that the
positions of the maximum of the total ﬁeld and that of
the electron ﬁeld nearly coincide. Therefore we evaluate
the ﬁeld
Eσ as deﬁned in Eq. (18).
Moreover, it is easily seen that the maximum of the ﬁeld
is situated on the axis, ahead of the electron cloud. The

The argument of the logarithm in the third term on the
right hand side being larger than 1, this criterion gives a
later time for the transition than that based on the ﬁeld
of the electrons only. This is what we expect considering
that the ions tend to reduce the ﬁeld of the electrons,
thus the eﬀect of space charge. The correction given by
the ion ﬁeld is a function of the ratio of the ionization
length ℓα and the diﬀusion length √2Dτ . At early times,
this ratio goes to inﬁnity, and the correction given by

correction becomes more signiﬁcant.

that, indeed, the correction only becomes important for
larger times.

Moreover, the approximation for the maximal ﬁeld
ahead has now become much better than the previous
approximation based on only the electron cloud. Indeed,
for e.g the case of E b = 0.5 (corresponding to the middle
thick lines), the numerically computed ﬁeld (solid line)

into account, this value would already be reached at

imation of the ion cloud leads to a transition time of
13.9. The correction becomes especially important

at lower ﬁelds. In high ﬁelds, the approximation of the
ions shows somewhat larger deviations. The ﬁgure also

times. It shows that the approximation of similar elec-
tron and ion distributions leads to a very good approxi-
mation of the transition time. From this ﬁgure it is also
clear that the transition time f τ depends strongly on
the electric ﬁeld, and grows larger towards smaller ﬁelds.
Moreover, looking at the transition time for higher dif-
fusion coeﬃcients, it is seen that diﬀusion tends to delay
the transition to the streamer regime. This can be ex-
pected, since diﬀusion will tend to broaden the electron
cloud, thereby suppressing space charge eﬀects.

For completeness, a 3-dimensional plot of the tran-
sition time approximated by Eq. (37) as a function of
both background electric ﬁeld and diﬀusion coeﬃcients
is shown in Fig. 4. From this ﬁgure, we see that Meek’s
transition criterion, that stated that f τ is approximately
constant, corresponds to the case of relatively high dif-
fusion and background ﬁeld. However, realistic values of
D are in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 at room temperature,
and a background electric ﬁeld higher than 2 also leads
to unrealistic values. So in the parameter range of real
experiments, the correction given by Eq.(3) on Meek’s
criterion can not be neglected.

density distribution

The previous approximation ρ1 of the ion distribution
leads to a relatively good approximation for the transi-

tion time in the case of a mid-gap transition. However,
the real ion distribution is more narrow in the r-direction,
and can be wider and asymmetrical in the z-direction. As
discussed in [15], it is the ﬁeld of the ion cloud that should
be high to suppress the background ﬁeld, so that, when
the electron cloud has drifted into the anode, new elec-
trons emitted by e.g. photoionization are drawn towards
the cathode, creating a positive streamer. In this section
we present another approximation for the ion distribu-
tion, which will lead to a better overall approximation of
the electric ﬁeld, and of the self ﬁeld induced by the ion
trail. The price however to pay for this is a much more
complicated analytical expression for the density and the
ﬁeld.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, the particle distributions and associated
ﬁelds of an electron avalanche in a homogeneous electric
ﬁeld were analyzed. During the exponential growth of
the total number of electrons and ions, the electrons are
described by the known Gaussian distribution, but we
found that the spatial moments of the ion distribution
can also be calculated. As a result, we ﬁnd that the cen-
ters of mass of electron and ion distribution both travel
with the electron drift velocity within the external ﬁeld.
For the ions this is remarkable, since they are assumed
to be immobile; their center of mass motion is therefore
purely due to generation of additional ions. The distance
between the centers of mass is given by the ionization
length 1/α(Eb). Furthermore, the electron cloud widens
homogeneously through diﬀusion, so its width both in
the longitudinal and in the radial direction is given by
√2Dτ . The ion cloud lags behind and has the some-
1/(αd)] in the
what smaller “delayed” radius
radial direction while its extension in the longitudinal di-
rection can be larger, in particular, for small times, as it is
1/(αd)] where ℓα is the
characterized by
dimensionless version of the ionization length 1/α(Eb).

Furthermore, we evaluate the ﬁeld of the electron cloud
exactly and the ﬁeld of the ion cloud approximately, and
derive a criterion for the avalanche to streamer transition
that takes diﬀusion into account. It corrects Meek’s crite-

In Fig. 5 we compare the densities and ﬁelds given by
the numerical solution and ρ1 and ρ2. It shows clearly
that the approximation ρ2 does not give a better approx-
imation of the ﬁeld ahead of the electron cloud. This
can be explained by the fact that, the region ahead of
the electron cloud does not contain any ions, so that the
ﬁeld induced by the ions is only a function of the total
number of ions, which is the same in both ρ1 and ρ2. On
the other hand, inside the ion cloud the approximation is
much better. Therefore, evaluating the electron and ion
densities with Eqs. (13) and (39) and their ﬁelds with
Eqs. (15) and (41), at the transition time T1 given by
Eq. (37), will give a good approximation of the status of
the process at the time that streamer regime is entered.

ﬁelds, the transition time saturates towards αd
15.
On the other hand, for low ﬁelds, when the processes are
diﬀusion dominated, the avalanche lasts much longer.

≃

The analytical models described in this paper give a
useful tool to describe the negative streamer formation.
Especially at relatively low, realistic, ﬁelds, the present
model gives an accurate description of the avalanche to
streamer transition. We stress that our criterion for the
transition is based on the space charges aﬀecting the
background electric ﬁeld in such a way that the lineariza-
tion around it no longer holds. This corresponds to the
moment that the electron cloud and its ion trail start re-
ducing sensibly the electric ﬁeld strength between them.
The criteria for spark breakdown derived by Meek [15],
and for positive streamer formation by Bazelyan [17] are
based on the space charges screening out the ﬁeld be-
tween the positively and negatively charged regions, i.e.
k =
(1). However, their calculations are based on the
linearization around the uniform background ﬁeld, which
obviously does not hold at these values of k. More-
over, the situation of complete screening might never be
reached in the full nonlinear dynamics [21, 25, 26].

O

8

In [17] the diﬀusive widening of the electron was not
accounted for in the derivation of the criterion. The dif-
fusion however has considerable eﬀects on the electron
and ion distribution, and especially at low ﬁelds it can
considerably delay the emergence of a streamer. Indeed,
in high ﬁelds, the transition to a streamer occurs after
the electron cloud has traveled a much shorter distance
than expected by Bazelyan.

The nonlinear streamer propagation is the subject
of other studies.
In that phase the space charges and
electric ﬁeld strongly interact, and the analytical study
of such streamers is far more diﬃcult than the analysis
of the avalanche phase [27].

Abstract

A previous proof of non existence of tokamak equilibria with purely
poloidal ﬂow within macroscopic theory [Throumoulopoulos, Weitzner,
Tasso, Physics of Plasmas 13, 122501 (2006)] motivated this micro-
scopic analysis near magnetic axis for toroidal and ”straight” tokamak
plasmas. Despite the new exact solutions of Vlasov’s equation found
here, the structure of macroscopic ﬂows remains elusive.

1 Introduction

Some time ago (see [1, 2]), it was possible to prove non existence of tokamak
equilibria with purely poloidal incompressible ﬂow. Recently, an extension to
compressible plasmas appeared in Ref.[3] including Hall term and pressure
anisotropy. The proof for the incompressible case given in Refs.[1, 2] was
global while the recent proof [3] is limited to the neighbouring of the magnetic
axis through a kind of Mercier expansion.

This last result motivated the idea to extend the analysis to Vlasov-
Maxwell equations examined near axis. An important ingredient is to write
the Vlasov equation in cylindrical coordinates in a tokamak geometry, which
simpliﬁes the subsequent analysis. We use for that purpose the calculation
done in an old ICTP report [4] where the Vlasov equation is written in
arbitrary orthogonal coordinates.

In Section 2 the expression of the Vlasov equation is obtained in toroidal
geometry.
In Section 3 the ODEs of the characteristics are derived while
Section 4 is devoted to ”straight tokamaks” and Section 5 to discussion and
conclusions.

2 Vlasov equation in orthogonal coordinates

As explained in Ref.[4] we consider a general system of orthogonal coordi-
nates x1, x2, x3 with the metric ds2 = g11(dx1)2 + g22(dx2)2 + g33(dx3)2 and
unit vectors ei = ∇xi
|∇xi| where i goes from 1 to 3. The velocity vector of a
”microscopic” ﬂuid element is then projected on the unit vectors ei as

v = viei,
(1)
where the components vi are independent upon space variables. The total
derivative of v is

∂v
∂t

+ v · ∇v = E + v × B,

(2)

where E and B are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds consistent with Maxwell
equations and the charge to mass ratio e
m is set to one. Projecting Eq.(2) on
the unit vectors we obtain

dvi
dt

= ei · (E + v × B) − ei · v × ∇ × v.

(3)

Finally, the Vlasov equation in orthogonal coordinates is given by

∂f
∂t

+ v · ∇f + ei · (E + v × B)

∂f
∂vi − (ei · v × ∇ × v)

∂f
∂vi = 0,

(4)

where f is a function of the xi, vi and time while v is given by Eq.(1). For
[4]. f stays here for the ion distribution while the
more details see Ref.
distribution function for the electrons is governed by an equation similar to
Eq.(4).

Let us now specialize on cylindrical coordinates x1 = r, x2 = φ, x3 = z.
Then ∇ × ei = 0 for i = 1 and 3 and ∇ × e2 = e1 × ∇φ. If we replace the
indices 1, 2, 3 by r, φ, z we have ∇ × v = vφer × ∇φ and

v × ∇ × v = −

(5)

So the last term of Eq.(4) becomes −[ (vφ)2
near axis and ∂f

∂t = 0 for steady state, Eq.(4) reads

3 ODEs for characteristics

Let us start with the simpler case I = 0, then the characteristics of Eq.(7)
are given by the solution of

dvr
(vφ)2 =
whose solution is (vr)2+(vφ)2 = C. Since f = f (C, vz) = f [((vr)2+(vφ)2), vz]
on axis we obtain for the toroidal ﬂow

dvφ
vrvφ ,

(8)

−

vφf d3v = 0,

Z

(9)

which means zero toroidal ﬂow on axis.

For I 6= 0 the characteristics are given by

−

dvr
vzI + (vφ)2 =

dvφ
vrvφ =

dvz
vrI

.

(10)

The last equality delivers C1 = vz − I ln |vφ|, the second characteristic being
the particle energy C2 = (vr)2 + (vφ)2 + (vz)2. C1 is ”antisymmetric” in vz
but symmetric in vφ, which leads to

vφf (C1, C2)d3v = 0,

vzf (C1, C2)d3v 6= 0.

(11)

It means that the φ-ﬂow is zero while the unphysical z-ﬂow is ﬁnite. This is
obviously not acceptable.

4 ”Straight” tokamaks

The straight tokamaks do have magnetohydrodynamic solutions with purely
poloidal ﬂow as known from previous work [5]. For the purpose of a micro-
scopic theory the appropriate coordinate system is the cartesian one x1 = x,
x2 = y, x3 = z so that the toroidal angular coordinate is replaced by y and
the toroidal ﬁeld I by By. Since ∇ × ei vanishes for all i, the term v × ∇ × v
in Eq.(4) disappears.

For the steady state with ﬁnite By, Eq.(7) is replaced by

− vz ∂f

∂vx + vx ∂f

∂vz = 0,

(12)

whose characteristic is given by

dvx
vz =
The solution of Eq.(13) is C = (vx)2 + (vz)2, which leads to f = f ((vx)2 +
(vz)2, vy). Purely poloidal ﬂows are possible, which is consistent with Ref.[5].

5 Discussion and Conclusions

The result of section 3 obliges us to change the assumptions leading from
Eq.(6) to Eq.(7) i.e. ∇f 6= 0 instead of zero on the magnetic axis. The
special canonical φ-momentum solution is of that kind, and leads naturally
to toroidal ﬂows but no poloidal ﬂows. However, a comprehensive discussion
of the problem cannot be done since the complete set of characteristics of
Eq.(6) is not known.

Finally, though we know from section 3 that f must be a function of C1
and C2, we could, in addition, choose f to have diﬀerent values for diﬀerent
signs of, for instance, vφ. A known example of that kind of solutions is the
case of BGK waves [6], in which the ”free particles” have diﬀerent distribu-
tions for diﬀerent signs of their velocities. See also Ref.[7] for a quasi-neutral
treatment. Though toroidal ﬂows can then be constructed , physical con-
straints like isotropy of the pressure tensor or constraints on other moments
or geometrical symmetries and, ultimately, collisions could exclude such so-
lutions. Again we are led to look for the general solution of Eq.(6) with
∇f 6= 0 on axis in order to discuss the structure of the macroscopic ﬂows.
Unfortunately, as mentioned before, the answer to this problem is quite un-
certain.

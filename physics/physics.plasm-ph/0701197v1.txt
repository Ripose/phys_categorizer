Abstract

The nature of current sheet formation in the vicinity of three-dimensional magnetic null points

is investigated. The particular focus is upon the eﬀect of the compressibility of the plasma on the

qualitative and quantitative properties of the current sheet. It is found that as the incompressible

limit is approached, the collapse of the null point is suppressed, and instead an approximately planar

current sheet aligned to the fan plane is present. Both the peak current and peak reconnection rate

are reduced. The results imply that previous analytical solutions for steady-state reconnection at

fan current sheets are dynamically accessible, while spine current sheet solutions are not.

INTRODUCTION

In astrophysical plasmas, such as for example in the solar corona, the three-dimensional

(3D) magnetic ﬁeld topology is often highly complex. In such complex 3D magnetic ﬁelds,

where traditional two-dimensional (2D) X-point magnetic reconnection models may no

longer be applicable, determining the sites at which dynamic phenomena and energy release

may occur is a crucial and non-trivial problem. Due to the typically very high Magnetic

Reynolds number, such events occur only where intense currents (singular under an ideal

MHD evolution) may form. One such site is a 3D magnetic null point (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4]). The

nature of current sheet formation at such 3D nulls is investigated here.

3D null points are predicted to be present in abundance in the solar corona [5, 6, 7].

Furthermore, there is observational evidence that reconnection at a 3D null may be im-

portant in some solar ﬂares [8], as well as in eruptive phenomena in active regions [9, 10].

In addition, the ﬁrst in situ observation of reconnection occurring at a 3D null point in

the Earth’s magnetotail has recently be made by the Cluster spacecraft [11]. Furthermore,

current growth at 3D nulls has been observed in the laboratory [12].

The magnetic ﬁeld topology and geometry in the vicinity of such a null can be described

by the two sets of ﬁeld lines which asymptotically approach, or recede from, the null. A pair

of ﬁeld lines approach (recede from) the null from opposite directions, deﬁning the ‘spine’

(or γ-line) of the null. In addition, an inﬁnite family of ﬁeld lines recede from (approach)

the null in a surface known as the fan (or Σ-) plane (see e.g. [13]).

To this point, many studies of the MHD behaviour of 3D nulls have been kinematic, see

e.g. Refs. [2, 14, 15, 16]. However, a few solutions to the full set of MHD equations do exist

for reconnection at current sheets located at 3D nulls, in incompressible plasmas. These

incompressible solutions are based upon the technique ﬁrst proposed by Craig & Henton

[17] for the 2D reconnection problem. The solutions describe steady-state current sheets

aligned to the fan [18] and spine [19] of the null. Time-dependent solutions for the fan

current sheets also exist [20].

In a previous paper [21]—hereafter referred to as paper I—we investigated the behaviour

of 3D null points which are subjected to shearing boundary motions, and found that cur-

rent sheets formed at the null.

In this paper we consider the eﬀect of moving from the

compressible towards the incompressible limit, which is found to have a profound eﬀect on

2

both the quantitative and qualitative properties of the current sheet. This is highly rele-

vant when it comes to comparing the observed current sheet formation with the analytical

models, which must by necessity invoke various simpliﬁcations. Typically, the plasma in

the solar atmosphere or Earth’s magnetosphere is relatively compressible (magnetic forces

tend to dominate plasma forces, and so are capable of compressing the plasma, or in other

words the plasma-β is typically less than 1). Thus it is of great interest to understand the

relationship between this regime and the incompressible approximation, upon which much

of the previous theory has been based. The incompressible limit is a better approximation

in, for example, the dense solar interior.

The remainder of the paper is set out as follows. In Sec. II we brieﬂy review the pre-

vious results of paper I. In Sec. III we describe simulations in which we move towards the

incompressible limit, and in Sec. IV, we discuss the relation of our results to analytical

incompressible solutions, and the implications for their dynamic accessibility. In Sec. V we

consider the case where we drive across the fan instead of across the spine of the null, and

ﬁnally in Sec. VI we present a summary.

II. BEHAVIOUR IN A COMPRESSIBLE PLASMA

In paper I, we discussed the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of a generic

3D magnetic null. We demonstrated by means of a kinematic solution that an evolution of

the null which acts to change the angle between the spine and fan (such that the ratios of

the null eigenvalues change in time) is prohibited in ideal MHD. We then went on to present

the results of numerical simulations, which demonstrated the formation of strong current

concentrations at the null in response to boundary perturbations. Simulation runs based on

the same numerical code are presented below. The code is described in detail in Ref. [22]

(see also http://www.astro.ku.dk/∼kg).

At t = 0 the magnetic ﬁeld in the domain is given by B = B0 (−2x, y, z), which deﬁnes a

3D null whose spine lies along the x-axis, and whose fan is in the x = 0 plane. J = 0, and so

taking the density (ρ) and internal energy (e) of the plasma to be uniform at t = 0 we begin

with an equilibrium (we take ρ = 1, e = βγ/(γ − 1), where β is a constant which determines

the plasma-β (which is of course spatially dependent) and γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats).

All of the domain boundaries are line-tied. The conﬁguration is then perturbed by imposing

3

a plasma ﬂow on the x-boundaries, while the y- and z-boundaries are placed suﬃciently far

away that there is insuﬃcient time for information to propagate to them and back to the

null before the simulations are halted.

The boundary driving takes the form on each boundary of two distorted vortices of

opposite sense, which combine to provide the desired eﬀect of advecting the spine in the ˆy

direction, in opposite directions on opposite boundaries (x = ±Xl) (see paper I, Eq. (17)

and Fig. 2(b)). In the majority of the runs described, the driving proﬁle is transient, with

its time dependence deﬁned by

v0, τ constant, so that the driving switches on at t = 0 and oﬀ again at t = 2τ . The result is

that a current concentration forms at the null, which is expected to be singular in the ideal

limit [4]. During the early evolution, a stagnation ﬂow, accelerated by the Lorentz force (but

opposed by the plasma pressure) acts to close up the spine and fan towards one another

locally at the null. The initial null is unstable to such a collapse of the spine and fan in any

yz-plane (containing the x-axis), with the z = 0 plane being selected by the orientation of

the boundary driving.

Due to this local collapse, a current sheet forms which typically spans the collapsed spine

and fan, with a tendency to spread along the fan surface (especially for weaker driving).

Accompanying the current growth is the development of a component of E parallel to B

(Ek), signifying a breakdown of ideal behaviour and magnetic reconnection. The integral of

this quantity along the magnetic ﬁeld line in the fan perpendicular to the shear plane can

be shown to give a physically meaningful measure of the reconnection rate—giving the rate

of ﬂux transfer across the fan (separatrix) plane [16]. An examination of the quantitative

properties of the current sheet showed that it has many of the properties of a Sweet-Parker

2D current sheet. In particular, it grows continually in both magnitude and dimensions under

continual driving, and the peak current, peak reconnection rate, and sheet dimensions scale

linearly with the modulus of the driving velocity.

In paper I we considered the case of a monatomic ideal gas, that is we took the ratio of

speciﬁc heats, γ = 5/3. It is straightforward to see that the incompressible limit may be

reached formally by letting γ → ∞. Taking the time-derivative of the polytropic equation

III. TOWARDS INCOMPRESSIBLE LIMIT

We repeat here the simulations described in paper I, with increased values of γ. This is

somewhat problematic numerically (due to the increased wave speeds), but in fact it turns

out that even for moderately large values of γ, the diﬀerences are striking.

A. Qualitative diﬀerences

The parameters chosen for the simulation runs closely follow those taken in paper I, and

are as follows. We take B0 = 1, the driving strength v0 = 0.01, τ = 1.8, Ad = 80 (boundary

driving localisation), β = 0.05, η = 5 × 10−4, and the numerical domain has dimensions

[±0.5, ±3, ±3].

As the driving begins (t = 0), a disturbance propagates along the spine (and nearby ﬁeld

lines), and focuses at the null. For γ = 5/3, the null point ‘collapses’ with the spine and

fan closing up towards one another. A strongly focused current sheet spans the spine and

fan. However, for increasing values of γ, the current concentration distributes itself along

the fan surface, becoming more weakly focused at the null for increasing γ (see Figs. 1, 2).

Furthermore, the fan surface remains increasingly planar at larger γ (see Fig. 2), and also the

spine and fan do not collapse towards each other to the same extent. This is demonstrated

in Fig. 4(f), where the minimum angle between the spine and fan (θmin) is plotted for runs

with various values of γ. We observe that even for γ = 10, although the current sheet

is approximately planar at x = 0, the minimum angle between the spine and fan is still

signiﬁcantly less than π/2. This is because the spine is still driven towards the fan by the

boundary driving (most of the stress from which is taken up in the weak ﬁeld region around

the null itself), even though the fan remains approximately in the x = 0 plane rather than

collapsing sympathetically towards the spine.

It is worth noting that the above described behaviour also depends on other parameters

in the simulation. For example the driving velocity also aﬀects how eﬀectively the null

collapses, with greater collapse and stronger focusing of the current sheet for larger v0 (see

paper I). Therefore larger values of γ are likely to be required in order to render the fan

approximately planar for larger v0, and also for larger τ (longer driving time). The plasma-

β is also a crucial parameter, since we ﬁnd that increasing β rather than γ has a very

similar eﬀect to that described above.

It is natural to expect this on physical grounds,

since increasing either parameter has the eﬀect of increasing the sound speed, and reducing

the eﬀect of magnetic forces in plasma compression. Furthermore, since the null collapse

is driven by the Lorentz force, a thinner more intense current sheet, which will form for a

lower value of η, will increase the degree of collapse.

An obvious question when examining the above results is whether the planar current

sheet in the x = 0 plane for large γ is a result of the symmetry of the conﬁguration, with

the null at the centre of the domain and the fan plane parallel to the driving boundaries.

We therefore re-ran the simulations at large γ with the null point rotated by a ﬁnite angle

in the xy-plane (so that the spine and fan were no longer parallel to the boundaries). In

this case, a planar current sheet still forms in the fan, and thus our results seem general in

this respect.

Fig. 3).

Accompanying the changing current localisation as we move towards the incompressible

limit is a change in the behaviour of the plasma ﬂow. This again signiﬁes the fact that the

fan of the null remains increasingly planar. For γ = 5/3, a stagnation ﬂow is typically set

up, which is accelerated by the Lorentz force (and opposed by the plasma pressure gradient),

and which closes up the spine and fan. However, for larger γ this ﬂow is absent, and instead

vx is approximately zero, and the ﬂow is roughly parallel with the driving boundaries (see

Finally, it should be noted that all of the above considerations are the same as for the

case of a 2D X-point. That is, repeating the above simulations but with the magnetic

ﬁeld at t = 0 deﬁned by B = B0(−x, y, 0), we see the same trend. For γ = 5/3 the X-

point collapses, forming a current sheet which locally spans the two separatrices (a ‘Y-point’

appearance), but for large γ the X-point collapse is suppressed, and the current spreads

along the (unsheared) separatrix (as in Ref. [17]).

B. Quantitative diﬀerences

It is not only the qualitative properties of the current sheet which are aﬀected by changing

the plasma compressibility. Accompanying the spreading of the current sheet along the fan

for increased γ is a decrease in the peak current and reconnection rate in the simulation.

This is illustrated in Fig. 4(a, b). The rate of change of each quantity around γ = 5/3

is much greater than that around γ = 10, implying that even for this moderate value of

γ, the behaviour is already a fairly good approximation to the incompressible limit (for

all other parameters ﬁxed). The change in geometry of the current sheet is evidenced by

the variation in the dimensions of the region of high |J|, Lx, Ly and Lz (measured at the

time of current maximum, by the full-width-at-half-maximum (f.w.h.m.) in each coordinate

direction). Ly and Lz increase with γ, showing how the sheet spreads along the fan plane as

we move towards the incompressible limit (Fig. 4(d, e)). On the other hand, Lx decreases

as γ increases, demonstrating how the null point collapse is inhibited (Fig. 4(c)). Even for

γ = 20, Lx essentially measures the current sheet ‘thickness’, determined by the value of η.

IV. RELATION TO ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS

A. Dynamic accessibility

In the steady-state solutions of Craig et al. [18, 19] the assumption of incompressibility

leads to a symmetry between B and v in the MHD equations. Progress is then made by deﬁn-

ing a 3D current-free ‘background ﬁeld’, upon which disturbance ﬁelds of low-dimensionality

are super-imposed. This necessarily results in current sheets which are also of reduced di-

mensionality. The solutions are sometimes referred to as ‘reconnective annihilation’, since

they contain current sheets of inﬁnite extent in at least one direction, and as a result the

plasma advects ﬁeld lines across either the spine or the fan, but they only diﬀuse towards

the other of these (through the current sheet). It might be expected that the inﬁnite nature

of the current sheets is due to the severe analytical restriction of low-dimensionality ‘distur-

bance ﬁelds’. However, as we have seen above, applying shearing boundary motions to the

spine footpoints of the null indeed results in a quasi-planar current sheet in the fan plane,

albeit only for large γ.

Of great importance for any steady-state solution is its dynamic accessibility under a time-

dependent evolution. Investigations into the dynamic accessibility of two-dimensional [17]

solutions have been carried out by various authors [23, 24, 25]. The results of the previous

section provide strong evidence that in a fully dynamic and fully 3D (yet incompressible)

system, the fan current sheet solutions are indeed dynamically accessible. One further

question which presents itself here is whether in fact the spine current solutions are also

dynamically accessible.

In the analytical solutions, a tubular spine current results from

shearing perturbations of the fan plane. This is investigated in Section V.

B. Breakdown of analytical solutions

It appears that in the incompressible limit, fan current solutions are dynamically acces-

sible, and (at least qualitatively) provide a good snapshot of the dynamical and fully 3D

behaviour. However, in the case of a compressible plasma this appears not to be the case.

In order to understand why this is, we must examine the force balance which exists in the

analytical solutions.

The method of the analytical solutions is based upon taking the vector product (‘curl’) of

the momentum equation, and solving this in conjunction with the induction equation. The

pressure can then be calculated a posteriori. However, it has been realised [26, 27, 28] that

this places a limit on the maximum current (or reconnection rate) which can be attained in

these ‘ﬂux-pile-up’ solutions, since the current sheet must be maintained by a large pressure

at inﬁnity. For current values above some limit, the pressure required is unphysically large.

We can similarly examine the plasma pressure which exists within the current sheet itself.

In the steady-state fan current solution of Craig et al. [18], the magnetic and velocity ﬁelds

are deﬁned by

B = λP + Y (x)ˆy + Z(x)ˆz, v = P + λY (x)ˆy + λZ(x)ˆz,

P = α (−x, κy, (1 − κ)z) .

λ, κ, α constant, 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1. The pressure is found from the momentum equation, and the

10

pressure gradient perpendicular to the fan plane is given by

Solving the induction equation for Y and Z (see Ref. [29]) reveals that in the current sheet,

∂Y /∂x ∼ η−(1+κ)/2, ∂Z/∂x ∼ η−(2−κ)/2. Thus in the current sheet we require a pressure

gradient which scales as a negative power of η, which becomes extremely large at realistic

values of η for astrophysical plasmas. Note though that the strongest pressure restriction

occurs in the degenerate 2D case (κ = 0 or κ = 1). Once the pressure gradient can no

longer accommodate the huge Lorentz force within the sheet, the null point will begin to

collapse, and the strict planar nature of the fan plane and current sheet will be lost (note

that the Lorentz force always points in the direction which further closes the angle between

spine and fan, while the pressure gradient acts in the opposite sense). A similar argument

has been made by Ma et al. [30] for the case of disturbances perpendicular to a 2D planar

X-point—they found that once the strict symmetry of the system was broken, qualitatively

very diﬀerent behaviour resulted.

Examining instead the time-dependent fan current sheet solutions [20], one reaches a

similar conclusion.

In those solutions, the time-dependent pressure gradient force in the

x-direction in the ideal localisation phase is given by

for one disturbance component. This peaks once resistivity becomes important and the

current density reaches a maximum value, and we have

The contribution of the other disturbance component is obtained by replacing κ by (1 − κ)

in each of the above, 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1. Thus the plasma pressure force in the x-direction (or

symmetry-breaking direction) increases exponentially in time, in order to counteract the

eﬀect of the increasing Lorentz force. For suﬃciently small η, the pressure force will no longer

be able to balance the Lorentz force during this localisation process, and the symmetry of

the conﬁguration will be lost.

The eﬀect of the pressure gradient within our simulations is shown in Fig. 5. Here, vectors

of ∇p are plotted in the z = 0 plane for γ = 10 at the time of the peak current. It is clear

that the pressure gradient force behaves exactly as described—its eﬀect is localised primarily

within the current sheet (near the x = 0 plane; compare with Fig. 2, and is directed in such

a sense as to oppose the collapse of the fan surface and current sheet.

The fact that the geometry of the current sheet which we observe in our compressible sim-

ulations is very diﬀerent to that of the analytical solutions is not completely unprecedented.

In fact, in laboratory experiments of the formation of current sheets at 3D nulls, Bogdanov

et al. [12] made a similar observation. They also found a current sheet forming at a ﬁnite

angle to either the spine or fan direction of the null, which had not been expected from

previous self-similar analytical solutions [31, 32]. However, it is interesting to observe that

the incompressible solutions are indeed recovered in the incompressible limit, even though

we make no assumption regarding the dimensionality of any ﬁelds in the solution.

Note ﬁnally that all of the arguments given above carry through to the 2D case. Thus

our results for the 2D null, when compared with the solution of Ref. [17], can be explained

by similar reasoning.

V. DRIVING ACROSS THE FAN

We now consider the case where the fan of the null is sheared rather than the spine. We

re-run the simulations with B = B0(x, −2y, z), and again drive in the y-direction on the

12

x-boundaries. This time we use a uni-directional driving proﬁle, which has the disadvantage

of compressing the plasma at the boundaries, causing a few extra numerical diﬃculties, but

has the advantage of shearing the fan plane in the same direction over the whole yz-plane

for each x-boundary. Speciﬁcally, we take

v = V0(t)π

1 − tanh2(Ayy/Yl)

1 − tanh2(Azz/Zl)

ˆy,

(2)

where V0 is again deﬁned by Eq. (1). We take v0 = 0.02, τ = 1.8, Ay = 12, Az = 5, domain

(cid:0)

(cid:1) (cid:0)

(cid:1)

dimensions Yl = Zl = 3, β = 0.05 and B0 = 2 (so that the travel time for the disturbance,

which propagates at the Alfv´en speed, to reach the null is the same as in the spine shearing

cases).

The evolution of the null point for an ideal monatomic gas (γ = 5/3) is very similar to the

case where the spine is driven. Once again the disturbance focuses towards the null point,

this time along its fan, and drives it to collapse. A current sheet which spans the spine and

fan results. This is expected by comparison with the behaviour of wave-like perturbations

[33, 34]. However, in the incompressible analytical solution of Craig & Fabling [19], a shear

of the fan leads to tubular current structures aligned to the spine of the null.

Examining the behaviour for larger values of γ, we ﬁnd that compressibility seems to

have a similar eﬀect to the spine driving case, but spine current sheets do not develop.

Speciﬁcally, decreasing the compressibility again means that the null does not collapse to

the same extent, though rather than spreading along the spine, the current again spreads

along the fan.

These results provide strong evidence that spine current sheets are not dynamically ac-

cessible, at least in the absence of strong (super-Alfv´enic) inﬂows to drive the localisation.

This result has previously been anticipated by Titov et al. [24]. We rather expect tubular

spine-aligned current structures to be associated with rotational motions [34], and thus with

a current which is aligned parallel to the spine, corresponding to ﬁeld lines spiralling around

the spine. By contrast, the current in the incompressible ‘spine current’ solutions is directed

parallel to the (undisturbed) fan plane (while being localised close to the spine).

VI. SUMMARY

We have presented the results of 3D resistive MHD simulations of a driven 3D null point.

We focussed on the eﬀect of moving from a compressible plasma towards an incompressible

one, by varying the ratio of speciﬁc heats, γ, in our simulations. This was found to strongly

aﬀect the resulting current sheet formation, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

We considered ﬁrst the case where the spine of the null is sheared from the boundaries.

For an ideal, monatomic plasma (γ = 5/3, compressible), the spine and fan of the null

collapse towards one another, and a strongly focused current sheet forms at the null, locally

spanning the spine and fan. However, as γ is increased, the collapse of the null, and in

particular of the fan plane, is suppressed. The current sheet spreads increasingly along the

fan surface, which remains increasingly planar throughout the simulation runs. In addition,

rather than forming a stagnation point ﬂow as the null collapses, the plasma ﬂow within

the domain stays approximately parallel to the driving boundaries for large γ. The same

eﬀect was found when β was increased rather than γ, due to the physically similar nature of

increasing either parameter, as discussed previously. Quantitatively, the peak current and

peak reconnection rate both drop signiﬁcantly as γ is increased (see also Ref. [4]).

Considering the case where the boundary shearing was applied across the fan plane of

the null rather than the spine, we found similar behaviour.

In particular, the null point

collapse is suppressed, and a more spatially diﬀuse current structure is found, localised to

14

the fan surface. Our results provide strong evidence that the steady-state analytical fan

current sheet solutions of Craig et al. [17] are in fact dynamically accessible in a fully 3D,

incompressible plasma. However, they also imply that the equivalent spine current sheet

solutions [19] are not. Examining the fan current sheet solutions, it appears that the reason

why they break down in a compressible plasma is the enormous pressure gradients which

are required to maintain the imposed symmetry. These pressure gradients scale inversely

with the resistivity, and so in astrophysical plasmas become unphysically large.

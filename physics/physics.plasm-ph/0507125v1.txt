Abstract

The feasibility of using antihydrogen for igniting inertial conﬁnement fu-
sion pellets or triggering large scale thermonuclear explosions is investigated.
The number of antiproton annihilations required to start a thermonuclear burn
wave in either DT or Li2DT is found to be about 1021/k2, where k is the
compression factor of the fuel to be ignited.

In the second part, the technologies for producing antiprotons with high
energy accelerator systems and the means for manipulating and storing mi-
crogram amounts of antihydrogen are examined. While there seems to be
no theoretical obstacles to the production of 1018 antiprotons per day (the
amount required for triggering one thermonuclear bomb), the construction
of such a plant involves several techniques which are between 3 and 4 orders
of magnitude away from present day technology.

Considering the ﬁnancial and energy investments needed to produce an-
timatter, applications will probably remain conﬁned to the military domain.
Since antihydrogen-triggered thermonuclear explosives are very compact
and have extremely reduced fall-out, we conclude that such devices will en-
hance the proliferation of nuclear weapons and further diffuse the distinction
between low-yield nuclear weapons and conventional explosives.

Matter-antimatter interaction produces more energy per unit mass than any other
means of energy production. For example, proton-antiproton annihilation releases

275 times more energy in the form of kinetic energy of charged particles than
nuclear ﬁssion or DT fusion. This energy is released by simple contact of anti-
matter with matter so that, in principle, no ignition energy is required to start the
reaction. It is therefore not surprising that the concept of using antimatter as an
energy source has been in scientiﬁc literature for decades [1, 2].

Other practical applications of antimatter are under consideration. For exam-
ple, antimatter propulsion systems [3], space based power generators [4], directed
energy weapons [4],1 and cancer therapy [5, 6]. Finally, both Edward Teller
[7, 8, 9, 10] and Andrei Sakharov [11], the key scientists in charge of the develop-
ment of the H-bomb in their respective countries, show in their published scientiﬁc
works a big interest in the annihilation properties of antimatter, the nuclear process
that after ﬁssion and fusion could lead to a third generation of nuclear bombs.

This paper is a summary of a comprehensive assessment of the feasibility
of producing large quantities of antiprotons and using them for igniting inertial-
conﬁnement fusion pellets or triggering large scale thermonuclear explosions [12].
In sections 2 to 6 we evaluate the number of antiprotons needed to start a ther-
monuclear detonation wave in either DT or a Li2DT mixture. In Sections 7 to
11 we examine the problems of producing, collecting, cooling, manipulating and
storing the required amounts of antiprotons and antihydrogen.

2 Matter-antimatter annihilation

When a particle meets it’s antiparticle they annihilate and the energy equivalent
to their total mass (2mc2) is converted into various new particles and kinetic
energy [13]. In the case of proton-antiproton annihilation, many different reaction
channels are possible, each resulting in the production of a different number of
charged and neutral particles. A good approximation is that three charged and two
neutral pions are produced on the average. Since neutral pions quickly decay into
photons, the typical pp annihilation process is as follows:

p + p → 3 π± + 2 π0 → 3 π± + 4 γ,

(1)

where E±
π = 236 MeV and Eγ = 187 MeV. An antiproton can also annihilate
with a neutron, in which case mostly pions are produced again, in numbers, on the
average, similar to pp annihilation.

1Directed energy weapons applications may include the projection of plasma jets, X-ray or

gamma-ray laser pumping, and antimatter beams.

2

Antiprotons, antineutrons and positrons can combine to form antinuclei, an-
tiatoms, antimolecules. Annihilation occurs when the two kinds of matter come
sufﬁciently close to one other. Even at some distance, a neutral atom and a neutral
antiatom will attract each other by van der Waals forces [10, 13]. As a conse-
quence, storage of antiatoms in a container made of matter is impossible in general.
However, there may exist metastable states of antiprotons in normal matter [14],
and p’s may possibly be stored in superﬂuid helium [14], a speculation encouraged
by the fact that helium is the only atom which, theoretically, cannot capture a low
energy antiproton [15].

3 Plasma heating with antiprotons

When a p annihilates in a hydrogen plasma, essentially all the annihilation energy
is radiated in the form of very energetic pions and photons. At solid hydrogen
densities, the mean free path of the 187-MeV photons is 25 m, so that they will not
loose energy in the plasma. However, the three 236-MeV charged pions will loose
energy by multiple Coulomb interactions with the electrons at a rate approximately
given by: dE/dx = 0.52 MeV/cm in solid H2 or DT and 2.06 MeV/cm in Li2DT .

If we now assume that annihilation takes place at the center of a sphere, the
energy dW deposited within a radius R = 1 cm is only 1.5 MeV out of the
total 1876 MeV annihilation energy. There are however several ways to improve
energy deposition, and thus plasma heating. Firstly, the fuel to be heated may be
compressed by a factor k, dE/dx will then be multiplied by k, and thus dW by k2/3.
But compression requires energy. Secondly, fuels such as Li2DT , which contain
more electrons, have a proportionally larger dE/dx. However, their thermonuclear
ignition temperature is also higher. Finally, annihilation may take place with a
nucleus.

When a p annihilates with a nucleon from a nucleus, because of the Fermi
motion of the annihilated nucleon, the nucleus will recoil with an energy of about
20 MeV. Furthermore, each of the 5 annihilation pions has a probability of colliding
with the rest of the nucleus. Hence, the average total energy deposition in a sphere
is

dE
dx
where ν = 3 is the number of charged pions and ǫ the local energy deposition by
the recoiling nucleus and the various pion-nucleus interaction debris.

dW = ν

R + ǫ,

(2)

In the case of p annihilation with deuterium or tritium ǫ is approximately
12 MeV on the average, about half of the energy corresponding to the Fermi

3

momentum. With heavy nuclei there have been many theoretical speculations in
the absence of measurements. The ﬁrst of these was introduced by Duerr and
Teller [9], who speculated that an antiproton would ﬁnd a very strong (900 MeV)
attractive potential when getting close to a nucleus. More recently [16], Los
Alamos scientists have calculated that annihilation in carbon would result in the
local energy deposition of about 100 MeV. Recent measurements at CERN show
that it is in fact only 33 MeV in carbon [6], and approximately 55 MeV in silicon
[17]. Low energy p’s annihilate mostly at the surface of nuclei, and thus local
energy deposition follows a A2/3 dependence on atomic weight.
In effect, the
CERN data is compatible with the expression :

ǫ ≈ 6.4A2/3

[MeV].

(3)

Hence, for p annihilation in H2, DT or Li2DT , ν is always about 3 and ǫ is
approximately equal to 0, 12 or 22 MeV respectively.

4 Thermonuclear burn of a particle-antiparticle plasma

A matter-antimatter plasma is obtained if some initially stable particle-antiparticle
mixture is suddenly ignited. The annihilation rate of two interacting species, with
number densities n and n, is

dn
dt

= −nnhσvi,

where hσvi is the annihilation reaction rate averaged over the Maxwell distribution.
Fig. 1 gives hσvi for ee and pp plasmas.

In a H − H plasma, equation (4) holds for both protons and electrons with

n = n = n0 = ρNA/2 initially. Hence, for a given temperature
n0
1 + t/τ

with

n =

.

If we assume T = 20 keV, hσvi is approximately the same for both e+e− and
pp annihilation. Thus the electron and the proton populations deplete at the same
rate, with a time constant of 5 ns for ρ = 0.07 g/cm3.

5 Annihilation in a matter-antimatter boundary layer

When matter and antimatter come into contact, annihilation primarily takes place
in a boundary layer in which particles and antiparticles are mixing. The thickness

eraged over the Maxwell velocity distribution.

of this matter-antimatter plasma is of the order of the antimatter mean-free-path in
matter, i.e., (3nσ)−1. A ﬁrst approximation, assuming that whenever an antipar-
ticle penetrates into the boundary layer it instantly annihilates, is an annihilation
rate per element area given by the total number of antiparticles impinging on that
surface. From the Maxwell velocity distribution one gets

2πmc2 .

r

(6)

The e+ annihilation rate is thus
mp/me ≈ 43 times the p annihilation rate.
However, since the H plasma Debye length is much smaller than the boundary
layer thickness, plasma charge neutrality insures that the antimatter ﬂow rate is
determined by the slowest annihilation rate. Therefore, if H’s interact with the
walls of a closed cavity, annihilation results in an overall decrease of the antimatter
density within the cavity.

p

Let us now take the case of a sphere of solid antihydrogen that is suddenly put
in contact with a collapsing spherical shell of compressed DT (see Fig. 2). To
solve Eq. (6) one has to calculate the increase in the H plasma internal energy by

where λ = 3 cm is the approximate range of the 20-MeV recoil protons from p
annihilation in DT , and N (initially equal to N0) the number of H atoms. For
hydrogen dW = 3NdT , we get a system of equations for the H plasma density
and temperature. If annihilation is much faster than the collapse of the cavity, R
remains constant and the solution of Eqs. (6) and (7) is

(cid:17)

For N0 = 1018, which corresponds to R = 0.02 cm, we ﬁnd T1 = 19 keV and
τa = 0.25 ns. Thus, in about 2τa = 0.5 ns, over 90% of the antihydrogen in the
sphere is annihilated. This time constant is compatible with the requirements of
instantaneous thermalization and inertial conﬁnement of the plasma.

6 Antiproton triggered thermonuclear detonation

wave

The most efﬁcient way to trigger a thermonuclear explosion is probably to start a
thermonuclear detonation wave in Li2DT by collapsing a hollow sphere of that
material on a tiny spherical pellet of solid antihydrogen (Fig.2).

In the spark model of thermonuclear ignition [18], an outgoing spherical det-
onation wave starts if : (a) a critical amount of energy Ec is deposited in the
center of the sphere (the "spark" region) and (b) if the temperature within this
volume is higher than a critical temperature Tc. Without compression, one has
Ec = 5 × 1025 keV and Tc = 4 keV for solid DT , and Ec = 3 × 1026 keV and
Tc = 13.6 keV for Li2DT . However, for a compressed thermonuclear fuel at
temperature Tc, the critical energy decreases with the square of the compression
factor k.

The number N of p annihilations necessary to induce a thermonuclear burn
wave can be estimated by supposing that annihilation takes place at the center of
the sphere to be ignited. Thus, from equation (2), condition (a) is satisﬁed if

Ec/k2 = N

series of concentric shells are imploded by chemical explosives or by other means.
When the innermost shell gets into contact with the levitated antihydrogen pellet,
annihilation produces sufﬁcient energy to trigger a thermonuclear burn wave in
the bulk of the Li2DT fuel. The multishell structure avoids excessive preheating
of the antihydrogen pellet during implosion.

Since the pions originate from the center, the temperature in the fuel goes as 1/r2.
Therefore, for simplicity, we require that condition (b) is satisﬁed for the average
temperature within the critical volume. Thus

(11)

where z and a are respectively equal to 2 and 2.5 for DT , and 6 and 9.5 for Li2DT .
Taking k = 30, a modest compression factor, and solving Eqs. (10) and (11) for
N and the spark radius Rs, one ﬁnds N = 3 × 1018 and Rs = 0.09 cm for DT ,
and N = 6 × 1018 and Rs = 0.07 cm for Li2DT . However, because of some
of the simplifying assumptions made, these results may be somewhat pessimistic.
Hence, we will assume that 1018 p’s are sufﬁcient to trigger the thermonuclear
explosion of compressed DT or Li2DT pellets.

For thermonuclear explosions in the kiloton range, chemical explosives may
be used to implode the Li2DT shells. For low yield explosions such as in X-ray
laser pumping or inertial-conﬁnement fusion (ICF), compression factors higher
than 30 can be achieved using magnetic compression, beams or other techniques.
However, antiproton induced fusion will remain an attractive alternative to normal
ICF only if the compression factor is kept relatively small, i.e., less than 300,
giving a number of p’s of the order of 1016.

7 Antiproton production

There are 4 main steps from p production in high energy particle collisions, to the
manufacture and storage of solid H (Fig. 3). In current systems, antiprotons are
produced when protons of high enough energy (over 6 GeV) are ﬁred into a target.
These p’s emerge with a wide variety of energies and a whole range of angles. This
very broad beam of p’s can be characterized by a very high temperature, of the
order of 100’s of MeV. The second step is to collect as wide a range of antiprotons
as possible and to start concentrating them in velocity and angle while storing
them in a ﬁrst high energy storage ring. The third step is to accumulate them
in a second ring while continuously "cooling" them until they all have the same
velocity and angle. Finally, when the p’s are cold enough, they can be decelerated
to zero velocity and combined with positrons to form neutral antihydrogen. In
this Section and the following three ones we examine the state-of-the-art in these
techniques and the possibility of using them for large scale antimatter production,
i.e., 1013 p/s (10−6 g of H or 1018 H atoms per day).

The only antiproton factory in operation today is at CERN near Geneva. It
produces 2 × 106 p/s at the output of it’s storage-cooling ring. By 1987, this

8

Figure 3: The four main steps of present day technology antiproton production.

system will be upgraded to produce 2 × 107 p/s [19]. At Fermilab, near Chicago,
an antiproton source of the same intensity is under construction [20]. Antiprotons
are also produced in the USSR [1] where there are plans for a system that will
permit storage of 108 p/s [21]. However, the most ambitious project is at Los
Alamos where the p ﬂux from the target is expected to be 100–200 times that of
CERN [22].

The economic feasibility of an antiproton factory depends crucially on the
accelerator system’s transformation coefﬁcient of electricity into antiproton rest
mass. Since the number of antiprotons produced increases logarithmically with the
collision energy, there is a broad optimum at 120 GeV, precisely the beam energy
of the Fermilab p source. However, compared with a ﬁxed target system, the use
of a particle-particle collider [23] is a much more efﬁcient means for high yield
particle production. With this method the optimum corresponds to a (16+16) GeV
collider. Such a collider could be built at Los Alamos where the construction of
a high intensity 8 to 45 GeV synchrotron and possibly a future colliding beam
facility [22, 24] are projected.

Colliding beams of heavy ions [25] may be an attractive alternative. Indeed, a
heavy ion collider of the required luminosity might be easier to build than a proton
collider, and in very high energy heavy ion collisions, one expects an enhanced
production of antiparticles such as antiprotons [26].

8 Antiproton collection

In ﬁxed target systems, both at CERN and Fermilab, a Soviet designed lithium
magnetic lens [27] is used to capture a wide spread of p’s as they are produced at
the target and to focus them on the aperture of the p collection channel (Fig. 3).
A plasma lens [19, 28] could be used instead to improve the angular acceptance.
However, it is more important to increase the momentum acceptance which is only
1 to 2% in present day systems. For that purpose, a linear debuncher between the
production point and the ﬁrst p storage ring could be used [29]. Together with
other possible improvements, the overall collection efﬁciency could be as high
as 0.05. To produce 1013 p/s, assuming an electric power efﬁciency of 25%, the
current of a 120 GeV beam would be 1 mA and the power load for the accelerator
about 450 MW.

To collect the p’s from a colliding beam source, there is an advantage in having
a small asymmetry in the two beam energies, for example 14 and 18 GeV. The
center of mass energy would still be very close to optimum but the p’s produced

10

at the threshold would go precisely in the direction of the fast beam, and with
an energy equal to the difference of the beam energies [30]. Assuming again a
collection efﬁciency of 0.05, the required luminosity for a proton-proton collider
would be 6 × 1040 for each of the 8 interaction points as in Fig. 4. The total beam
current for supplying 14 and 18 GeV protons to the collider is then 0.6 mA and
the power load 50 MW. These numbers are quite close to the state-of-the-art. For
example, the present 0.8 GeV Los Alamos accelerator normally runs with a current
of up to 0.9 mA, and there is a proposal to accelerate 0.17 mA of that beam to 8
GeV and as much as 0.07 mA up to 45 GeV [22]. But building the desired collider
will be a much more difﬁcult task [25], unless a big p production enhancement in
heavy ion collisions is found.

9 Antiproton cooling

Cooling aims at reducing the angular and energy spread of a beam circulating
in a storage ring. There are two basic techniques: electron cooling which was
pioneered in the Soviet Union [21, 31] and stochastic cooling which has been
invented at CERN [32].
In many respects electron and stochastic cooling are
complementary [33]. The efﬁciency of electron cooling is best for the cold and
stochastic cooling for the hot beams. This suggests combining pre-cooling with
stochastic and ﬁnal cooling with electrons.

Stochastic cooling systems based on present techniques are capable of cooling
as many as 108 to 1010 p/s [32]. Even with 8 systems working in parallel this
is short by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude of being able to produce 1013 p/s. The
only solution known at this time to go beyond this limit is to use multiple cooling
rings. If each of these rings is fed by a different collection channel, the theoretical
improvement in the overall cooling rate is n ln n, about 23, for 10 rings working
in parallel.

The main advantage of electron cooling is that it does not suffer any intrinsic
particle number limitation [21, 33]. But, unlike stochastic cooling, electron cooling
times are strong functions of the p beam momentum and p beam temperature.
Furthermore, electron cooling has never been tested with more than 109 particles
[33]. Nevertheless, if sufﬁcient debunching and precooling can be achieved,
electron cooling should be capable of handling a rate of 1012 p/s or higher. This
is why most cooling research in both the USA and the USSR has concentrated on
electron cooling. A conceivable system would consist of three rings as in Fig. 4.
Then, if a combination of debunching, stochastic pre-cooling and electron cooling
could cool 1012 p/s, our problem would be solved. This is by no means a simple

11

produced at the eight interaction points where the high energy (≈16 GeV/nucleon)
proton or heavy ion beams collide. The antiprotons are collected, cooled and
processed into antihydrogen by eight systems working in parallel.

task, but there doesn’t appear to be any fundamental obstacles.

10 Antiproton storage

The only antimatter storage technique proven today is that of storage rings [34, 35].
For practical applications, it is necessary to ﬁnd more permanent means for storage,
and for ease of handling, if possible in solid form. This problem has been studied
extensively in the conceptual design of antimatter spacecraft propulsion systems
[3]. Many different techniques are feasible in principle, but they still have to be
tested experimentally.

In any event, the ﬁrst thing is to decelerate the p’s down to a few eV. For
that purpose, the most promising method involves the use of a radio-frequency
quadrupole [36] as a decelerator from 5 MeV (or more) down to approximately
100 keV, and to catch the p’s in a ion trap in which they are cooled by resistive

12

damping of image currents or by electron cooling [14]. In an ion trap (also called
Penning trap) the density of stored p’s can reach 1011 pcm−3 [37]. The lifetime of
the p’s is primarily limited by annihilation after capture by the residual gas atoms.
Pressures lower than 10−15 Torr and liquid helium temperatures are required to
keep the loss rate below 10−6 s−1.

11 Antihydrogen production and storage

Much higher storage densities are possible if the antiprotons are combined with
positrons to form neutral H. Antihydrogen formation is quite difﬁcult [38].
However, since positrons are much easier to produce and cool than p’s, large scale
H production is certainly feasible at a cost that would be marginal compared with
the investment necessary for a full-scale p production plant.

Once neutral hydrogen has been formed, it has to be further slowed and cooled.
Storage rings may be used to store H, but for this purpose, cooling and subsequent
manipulation, laser techniques are probably better. One method is called resonant
radiation cooling and capture [39] which can also be used to create a trap for the
atomic antihydrogen [40].

If atomic H is transformed into molecular H 2,it can be cooled to very low
temperatures were it will assume the low energy parahydrogen state. Since this
molecule is diamagnetic, it can be directed to the storage container by hexapole-
type magnetic ﬁeld channels that have a zero ﬁeld at the center. At temperatures
below 14 K, the H 2 molecules can then condense to form solid antihydrogen
pellets which can be stored using either magnetic, electrostatic or laser levitation
techniques [3].

For long term storage of solid H pellets, passive systems using permanent or
superconducting magnets are probably the most promising. If some forces (due
for example to the acceleration of a rocket) are acting on the pellet, the magnetic
levitation system may be aided by an electrostatic ﬁeld or a laser beam to balance
them.

12 Discussion and conclusions

The physics of matter-antimatter interaction has been reviewed and the main
conclusions can be summarized as follows:

13

Figure 5: A possible design for a 1 kt antimatter bomb. One microgram of
antihydrogen in a microcryostat is levitated at the center of a 100 g Li2DT sphere.
Implosion of the Li2DT by means of chemical explosives brings the thermonuclear
fuel into contact with the antihydrogen. The energy release by annihilation is fast
enough to trigger an outgoing thermonuclear detonation wave which burns the
Li2DT . Depending on the amount of compression by the chemical explosives,
the device operates as a 1 kt neutron bomb (ERW — Enhanced Radiation Warhead)
or a 1 kt blast bomb (RRR – Reduced Residual radioactivity). In either case, the
antimatter bomb will have very reduced radioactive fall-out and electromagnetic
pulse effects.

14

• Plasma heating by the charged particles produced in p annihilation with
protons or nuclei is a rather inefﬁcient process. However, if the fuel to be
heated is slightly compressed (k = 30), the energy from the low velocity
particles (protons, recoiling nuclei) can be contained to give an energy
deposition of about 15 to 35 MeV per annihilation in DT or Li2DT .

• Annihilation in a hot matter-antimatter plasma is relatively slow: about 5 ns
for a H-H plasma. However, if a small amount of antimatter is brought in
contact with dense matter, annihilation in the boundary layer is quite fast.
A pellet of H disappears in about 0.5 ns or respectively 0.2 ns when it
comes in contact with a collapsing shell of compressed DT or Li2DT . This
very short duration energy release makes antimatter a good candidate as an
energy source for pumping X-ray or gamma-ray lasers [4].

• The number of p annihilations required to start a thermonuclear burn wave
in either DT or Li2DT is found to be about 1021/k2. Thus for k = 30
(about the maximum compression factor that can be achieved with chemical
explosives) N = 1018.

The technologies for producing p’s with high energy accelerator systems,
and the means for manipulating and storing sizable amounts of H have been
examined. With reference to the conceptual design of a 1 kt antihydrogen triggered
thermonuclear bomb shown in Fig. 5, and with the objective of designing an
antimatter factory capable of producing the 1013 p/s needed for manufacturing one
such H-bomb per day, the main results can be concluded as follows:

• Under ideal conditions such as highly efﬁcient p collection and very small p
losses throughout the plant, the production of 1013 p/s requires either a ﬁxed
target system with a 1 mA, 120 GeV proton accelerator, or a (16+16) GeV
colliding beam p source with a proton supply current of 0.6 mA. Assuming
an AC power to beam power efﬁciency of 25%, the accelerator’s electric
power requirement is 500 MW in the ﬁxed target and about 50 MW in the
collider system. The energy needed to produce one p is thus of the order
of 10−6 J, so that the production of 1016 p’s for each antimatter triggered
ICF pellet would require an energy investment of at least 104 MJ. It will
therefore be very difﬁcult to achieve energy break-even in power generating
reactors using annihilation techniques. Therefore, civilian applications of
antimatter for power production are very unlikely.

• If the expected enhancement of p production in high-energy heavy-ion col-
lisions is demonstrated by experiment, a high luminosity heavy-ion collider

15

would probably be the best source of p’s. Compared with a ﬁxed target p
source, a collider can be designed to optimize conditions for p collection
and cooling.

• The most difﬁcult problem is the cooling of the very hot p’s produced in high
energy collisions to temperatures low enough so that they can be permanently
stored in (relatively) simple systems, or combined with positrons to form
antihydrogen. The state-of-the-art is short by 2 to 4 orders of magnitudes
from being able to cool 1013 p/s. However, possible improvements in
stochastic and electron cooling will probably bridge the gap.

• As intense beams of cold low energy positrons become available, H forma-
tion becomes easier. Small pellets of solid H can be levitated in a vacuum
by a variety of magnetic, electric and laser techniques, and stored for very
long periods if the vacuum is better than 10−15 Torr.

• If p cavitation in superﬂuid helium is found experimentally, formation of H

would not be necessary for long term bulk storage of antimatter.

• The electromagnetic levitation of a 10−6 g H pellet within a 1 mm di-
ameter microcryostat at the center of a large Li2DT sphere such as in
Fig. 5 is a tremendous challenge for materials microtechnology. However,
if metastable states of p’s in Li−, Be− or possibly C − DT compounds are
discovered, much simpler designs could be considered.

Before concluding, we note that a plant of the size required to produce the
antimatter needed for one thermonuclear bomb trigger a day (10−6g of H or
1018 H atoms per day) could consist of several 10’s of accelerators and storage
rings, and could require as many as several large nuclear power plants to supply
the electricity. However, considering the advances in technology since 1945, the
relative complexity and cost of such a p factory are not out of proportion with those
of a large uranium enrichment plant. Indeed, a study by the RAND Corporation
gives a cost estimate of $500 to 1000 million for a prototype factory providing
10 to 100 micrograms, and $5 to 15 billion for a full production factory with an
output of about 10 mg per year [4].

From the point of view of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the fact that
antimatter-triggered thermonuclear weapons will have extremely reduced radioac-
tive fallout, even for ground bursts, is an important consideration. Since such
explosives may be advocated for "peaceful nuclear explosions," the current non-
proliferation regime is being threatened by the growing spread of high energy ac-
celerator technologies [41]. Moreover, from a strategic point of view, the possible

16

advent of extremely compact and essentially clean nuclear weapons would further
diffuse the distinction between low-yield nuclear weapons and conventional ex-
plosives. Finally, in the event of a comprehensive test ban treaty, antimatter would
provide a means for triggering laboratory and small scale thermonuclear explo-
sions in a yield range which cannot easily be covered by underground explosions
or classical ICF systems [41].

Abstract

Nonstationary and nonequilibrium processes are considered on the basis of an
Enskog-Landau kinetic equation using a boundary conditions method. A nonsta-
tionary solution of this equation is found in the pair collision approximation. This
solution takes into account explicitly the inﬂuence of long-range interactions. New
terms to the transport coeﬃcients are identiﬁed. An application of the boundary
conditions method to hydrodynamic description of fast processes is discussed.

Key words: Nonequilibrium process, kinetic equation, transport coeﬃcients

The development of methods to construct a theory for nonequilibrium pro-
cesses in dense gases, liquids and plasmas is an important direction in the
modern theoretical physics. Moreover, the construction of kinetic equations
for such classical and quantum systems still remains to be a major problem
in the kinetic theory. It is complicated additionally in the case of dense gases,
liquids and plasmas, where kinetics and hydrodynamics are closely connected
and should be considered simultaneously [1–5].

An approach for construction of kinetic equations from the ﬁrst principles of
statistical mechanics, namely from the Liouville equation, has been developed
in [6,7]. Another approach for obtaining kinetic equations fordense systems,
which is based on ideas of papers [6,7], has also been proposed [1] and gener-
alized in [2,3]. Here, the formulation of modiﬁed boundary conditions for the
BBGKY hierarchy is used taking into account corrections connected with lo-
cal conservation laws. On the basis of this sequential approach, a new Enskog-
Landau kinetic equation has been obtained for an one-component system of
charged hard spheres. There is a considerable interest of an application of
this kinetic equation for description of transport processes in dense systems of

charged particles as well as in ion melts and electrolyte solutions. The normal
solution and transport coeﬃcients for this equation have been found in the pa-
per [8] using the Chapman-Enskog method. The same approach has been used
for a many-component system of charged hard spheres in the paper [9] with
more detailed calculations for a two-component system as well. At the same
time, as is well known, the Chapman-Enskog method allows one to ﬁnd the
transport coeﬃcients in a stationary case only. Similar drawbacks are peculiar
to the Grad method [10,11] which is oftenly used to solve kinetic equations
next to the Chapman-Enskog method.

In this paper, the Enskog-Landau kinetic equation for a system of charged hard
spheres is investigated. To ﬁnd the normal solution in a nonstationary case, the
so-called boundary conditions method is used, which has been introduced in
[12,13]. As a result, transport coeﬃcients equations in the nonstationary case
are written. A limiting case of the stationary process is considered. A brief
comparison of the obtained transport coeﬃcients with those known previously
from the Chapman-Enskog method is given.

Let us consider the Enskog-Landau kinetic equation for a one-component sys-
tem of charged hard spheres [8]:

f1 (x1; t) = IE (x1; t) + IM F (x1; t) + IL (x1; t) ,

where f1(x1; t) is the one-particle distribution function. The right-hand side
of this equation is the so-called generalized Enskog-Landau collision integral,
where each term can be considered as a separate collision integral. Their struc-
ture are as follows:

It is necessary to note that the quasiequilibrium binary correlation function g2
takes into account the full interaction potential (hard core part plus long-range
Coulomb tail).

One of a major problem at the correct derivation and solution of kinetic equa-
tions is their consistency with local conservation laws of particle density (or
mass), momentum, total energy and substantiation of hydrodynamic equa-
tions and incomprehensible calculation of transport coeﬃcients via molecular
parameters. These conservation laws for classical systems in general have the
structure as in [17].

To ﬁnd a solution of the Enskog-Landau kinetic equation (1) using one or
another method, there is necessary to take the advantage of local conserva-
tion laws in corresponding approximations. So doing the expressions for ki-
netic coeﬃcients will be deﬁned through densities for momentum ﬂow tensor
↔
Π (r; t) and energy ﬂow vector jE(r; t) on the basis of solution f1(x1; t) and
corresponding approximations for g2(r1, r2; t). As far as we ﬁnd the solution
that corresponds to linear hydrodynamical transport processes by gradients of
↔
Π (r; t) and
thermodynamical parameters, densities of momentum ﬂow tensor
energy ﬂow vector jE(r; t) could be determined immediately with the help of
kinetic equation (1) without general formulas from [17]. To this end it is conve-
nient similarly to [2], to introduce the following hydrodynamical parameters:
density n(r1; t) (or mass density ρ(r1; t)), hydrodynamical velocity V (r1; t)
and density of kinetic energy ωk(r1; t). Multiplying initial kinetic equation (1)
by hydrodynamical parameters and integrating with respect to v1, one can
obtain the equations for these parameters in the form:

F l = g2f1f1 [8]. A short comment is needed for (7). First of all equation (7) is
a balance equation for a kinetic part of total energy. To write the conservation
law for total energy it is necessary to know also two-particle distribution func-
tion f2(x1, x2; t) next to one-particle one, because the potential part of total
energy is expressed via f2. The Enskog-Landau kinetic equation in “pair col-
lision” approximation has been obtained from the BBGKY hierarchy with a
modiﬁed boundary condition in [2], where the expression for f2 is also pointed
out. An average value for the potential energy and its ﬂow one should be cal-
culated on the basis of this expression. Then, adding it to the balance equation
(7), one can obtain the conservation law for total energy.

(x1; t) + δf (x1; t)

and search of the normal solution implies treatment of the correction δf (x1; t).

Conventional signs used in the equation (12) are obvious [2,8,9]. Also the
fact was taken into account about IM F (x1; t), collision integral (3), which is a
functional of one-particle distribution function only. Terms with the subscript
E are nonlocal, therefore in further calculations we should take their expansion
with respect to the local one-particle distribution function and cut-oﬀ this
expansion by terms with degrees higher than δf . In the case when terms
with subscripts MF and L also mean nonlocal functionals, one should apply
mentioned above procedure to them too. Let us combine some terms in (12):

Now let us designate Lt (δf ) = I (0)
an operator S (t, t′) with the following properties:

E (δf ) + IM F (δf ) + IL (δf ) and introduce

∂

S (t, t′) = Lt (δf ) S (t, t′) ,

S (t, t′)

Using these properties of operator S (t, t′), one can represent equation (12)
in an integral form. Having correction δf (x; t) in an integral form, it is easy
to cross to itemizing procedure for ﬁnding it in corresponding approximation.
For example, it can be organized in the following way:

t→−∞ δf (x; t) = 0. In order to construct the (k +1)-th approximation it is
limit lim
necessary to use the fact that δf
|k=0 = 0 and the conservation laws (or equa-
tions for reduced description parameters) in k-th approximation. To realize
this procedure a zeroth approximation for the one-particle distribution func-
tion f (0)
1 (x1; t) is needed. In the case of spherical charged particles, f (0)

can be chosen as the local-equilibrium Maxwell distribution function

Terms related to short-range interactions only contribute evidently into the
correction in this approximation. Contrary to the kinetic theory of dilute gases
particle sizes take part here [6,7,11], where particles are considered as point-
like objects. Nevertheless, the inﬂuence of both long-range and short-range
parts of interactions are also “hidden” in operator S(t, t′) (through operator
Lt). Formally, the expression (19) looks completely the same as the correction
in [18]. But a diﬀerence lies in the structure of the operator S(t, t′).

Having total expression for correction δf (x1; t) in the ﬁrst approximation (19)
one can calculate conservation laws (5), (6) and equation (7) in the same ap-
proximation. Therefore, it is necessary, ﬁrst, to obtain relations for determining

same structure as in the Chapman-Enskog method [8]. But other transport
coeﬃcients exhibit some distinctions. The structure for shear viscosity η and

Then the problem lies in calculating collision integrals I (0)

this means that we should calculate collision integrals (2) (in the zeroth ap-

culty is that correction (19) in its turn is expressed also via collision integrals
E (δf ), IL(δf ), which are in the operator S(t, t′). So the ﬁrst acceptable ap-

The results of this paper (19), (29) and (30) will coincide completely with
those from [8] when in a long-range part of the collision integral (31) one
puts g2(r1, r1 + r12)
1 and represents it in Boltzmann-like form. But the
used boundary conditions method has turned out more convenient than the
Chapman-Enskog one [2,8]. As was discussed in details in [12] at construct-
ing the normal solution for a kinetic equation using the boundary conditions
method, time derivatives ∂/∂t of hydrodynamic parameters of reduced descrip-
tion do not set to be small. Therefore, the normal solution to this equation
could be used for hydrodynamic description of fast processes.

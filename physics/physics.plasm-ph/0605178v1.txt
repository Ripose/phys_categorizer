Abstract

The regimes of quasi-mono-energetic electron beam generation were experimentally studied in

the sub-relativistic intensity laser plasma interaction. The observed electron acceleration regime

is unfolded with two-dimensional-particle-in-cell simulations of laser-wakeﬁeld generation in the

self-modulation regime.

INTRODUCTION

Laser accelerator [1] development is now entering a new mature stage in which it has

become possible to manipulate in a controllable way the parameters of accelerated charged

particle beams. For a broad range of applications, high stability in ultrarelativistic electron

production is required, which implies high directionality, controllability and reproducibil-

ity in the accelerated electron energy and collimation. Quasi-monoenergetic electron beam

generation has been observed in several laser-plasma interaction experiments, the results

of which are presented in Refs.

[2, 3]. This breakthrough resulted from many previous

investigations of laser-driven charged particle acceleration conducted by a number of scien-

tiﬁc groups (see Ref. [4]), where the high energy electron production and huge accelerating

gradients (≈ 100 GV/m) have been observed.

In a majority of the above mentioned experiments, the intensity of the laser light at the fo-

cus was relativistic, i.e. the dimensionless laser ﬁeld amplitude, a0 = eE0/meωc, was greater
than unity: a0 ≈ 0.85[(I/1018 W/cm2)(λ/1µm)2]1/2 > 1. Here, e is the electron charge, E0

is the laser pulse peak electric ﬁeld, me is the electron mass, ω is the laser frequency, and c

is the speed of light in vacuum. Moreover, the plasma density was also substantially large,

e.g. the electron density at which the quasi-monoenergetic electron production was observed
[2, 3], ranged from 6 × 1018 cm−3 to 1.3 × 1020 cm−3. High enough electron density provides

favorable conditions for self-focusing and stimulated Raman scattering development result-

ing in laser pulse self-modulation and the enhancement of the wake-ﬁeld amplitude. This

leads to the wakewave-breaking and the electron injection into the acceleration phase. On

the other hand the nonlinear process development raises additional questions on the direc-

tionality of the accelerated electron bunches, which demonstrates a need of further thorough

experimental studies of the quasi-monoenergetic electron beam generation.

Below, in this letter, we present the the results of experiments on the electron accelera-

tion during a multi-terawatt femtosecond range laser interaction with an underdense plasma

under the conditions, when the self-modulated wakeﬁeld regime occurs [5]. The accelera-

tion regime is corroborated with 2D-particle-in-cell computer simulations of the laser pulse

interaction with the underdense plasma.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND CONDITION

The experiments are performed with a terawatt 10 Hz Ti:Sapphire CPA laser system

”JLITE-X” (λ=800 nm) at the Advanced Photon Research Center of the Japan Atomic

Energy Agency (JAEA-APRC). The laser pulse with 230 mJ pulse energy on target has a

typical duration (half maximum ) equal to 70 fs. The estimated peak power of the laser beam
is 3 TW. The ratio of the prepulse to the main pulse intensity is less than 10−5. The laser
beam is focused onto the target by using a 15o, 646 mm focal length, f/13 oﬀ-axis parabolic
mirror. The spot size at the focus is 15µm at half maximum and 25µm at 1/e2. The
energy concentration is 55 % within the 1/e2 spot. The focal peak intensity is estimated
to be 9 × 1017W/cm2. It corresponds to a dimensionless amplitude of the laser ﬁeld, a0,

equal to 0.67. By evacuating the laser beam path between the pulse compressor and the
interaction chamber the pressure is made to be less than 10−1 Pa. We measured the neutral

gas density in the target, a 600 µm long supersonic He gas-jet, by using a Mach-Zehnder

interferometer. The plasma density is calculated by doubling the neutral gas density under

the assumption of full helium ionization. This assumption is based on the fact that for
our experimental conditions the barrier-suppression-ionization threshold intensity for He2+
is equal to 3.9 × 1016W/cm2 [6] and the tunneling ionization threshold is 8.8 × 1015W/cm2.
These thresholds are well below the laser intensity at focus, ≈ 1018W/cm2. As a result the
plasma density at the focus is calculated to be n0 = 5×1019 cm−3. For the above parameters

the wake wave wavelength, λp = 2πc/ωpe ≤ 10λ, is shorter than the pulse length, which is
about ≈ 30λ. The laser power, 3 TW, is above the threshold for the relativistic self-focusing,
P > Pcr = 17(ω/ωpe)2GW , [7]. Here ωpe = (4πn0e2/me)1/2 is the Langmuir frequency and

λ is the laser wavelength.

In order to detect an energetic electron spectrum, we use an electron spectrometer (ESM)

which is composed of a slit shape lead collimator (the slit width, w, is equal to 5 mm),

an electromagnet, and two-layered Imaging Plates (IP) [BAS-SR, Fuji ﬁlm product]. The

spectrometer is placed at the rear side of the target behind the interaction point. Each IP

is covered with 12 µm thick Al foil in order to avoid exposure to visible light and the low

energy electron component. We note that the IP is sensitive not only to the signal created

by the fast electrons but also to the X-rays. As a consequence of this, there is a problem

of separation of the signal produced by the electrons from the noise originating from the

3

X-rays. In order to obtain an IP image which is predominantly formed by the electron beam

and to ascertain whether the electron beam contains a quasi-monoenergetic component, we

varied the magnetic ﬁeld value from 0 to 0.13 T by changing the drive electric current in

the electromagnet. As a result, we found that X-ray signal eﬀects are not so important for

estimating the electron number.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the typical energy resolved electron beam image obtained with the ESM

and the electron energy spectrum. Here, the horizontal coordinate presents the energy

proﬁle at the IP and the vertical coordinate shows the electron spatial distribution. The
image is taken from a single shot. In this case, the plasma density is set to be 4.7 × 1019
cm−3. A well localized in space and energy spot is seen in the vicinity of the energy equal

to 19.6 MeV. The image spatial size at the IP in the vertical direction is 5.7 mm at the half

maximum. For the distance between the gas jet and the IP equal to 760 mm, we ﬁnd the

electron beam divergence to be about 7.5 mrad. We point out that for lower plasma density,
n = 3.1×1019 cm−3, the electron energy distribution taken with ten accumulated shots, does

not show a high energy component in the electron beam. In order to obtain the electron

number in the quasi-monoenergetic components, we integrate the electron distribution at

the IP over the energy. By using the sensitivity of the IP (see Ref. [8]), the total charge of

the quasi-monoenergetic electron component in the energy range from 16.3 to 25 MeV and

in the angle 5 mrad is found to be ≈0.8 pC with the energy spread approximately equal to

4.8 MeV at the half maximum.

We have also observed spatial-spectral split images. The typical spatial (along the vertical

axis) and spectral (along the horizontal axis) resolved images are shown in Fig. 2. These

images are taken in a single shot under the same conditions as in the case presented in Fig.

1. In Fig. 2(a), we see a single peak in space and a double peak in the energy distribution.

The energies of the double peak component are 13.5 MeV and 18.1 MeV, respectively. In

Fig. 2(b), a triple spatial split peak with diﬀerent quasi-monoenergetic energies is presented.

Here, the peak energies of the triple peak are 3.3 MeV, 4.5 MeV, and 7.5 MeV, respectively.

The directionality of electron beam with respect to the laser propagation direction are -13

mrad, 6 mrad, and 20 mrad.

4

We are able to control the electron beam parameters by changing the plasma density

in the target. Figure 3 a) shows the electron energy spectra (each of them is taken in a

single shot) at four diﬀerent values of the plasma density. By increasing slightly the backing
pressure of the gas jet the plasma density is set to be equal to 4.1 × 1019 cm−3 (1), 4.7 × 1019
cm−3 (2), 5.0 × 1019 cm−3 (3), and 6.6 × 1019 cm−3 (4). This results in changing the position

of the quasi-monoenergetic peak from 8.5 MeV to 19.6 MeV. At the plasma density above
4.7 × 1019 cm−3, the energy width of the electron beam becomes broadened.

IV. RESULTS OF 2D-PIC SIMULATIONS

In order to elucidate the acceleration regime responsible for the quasi-monoenergetic

electron beam formation, extensive two-dimensional PIC simulations of the laser pulse in-

teraction with the underdense plasma target have been performed with the use of the REMP

code [9]. In the simulations presented here a linearly p-polarized laser pulse with the di-
mensionless amplitude a0 = 0.67, corresponding to the peak intensity I = 9 ×1017 W/cm2

for λ = 0.8 µm laser, propagates along the x axis. The laser pulse has a Gaussian envelope
with FWHM size 27 × 31 λ2. The plasma density is n0 = 2.32 × 10−2 ncr, i.e. n0 = 5 × 1019
cm−3, which corresponds to ωpe/ω = 0.153. Ions have an absolute charge two times larger
than the electrons, and mass ratio mi = me × 4 × 1836. The simulation box has 4500×620

grid points with a 0.1 λ mesh size. The target has the form of an underdense plasma slab
of size 425×60λ2. The total number of quasiparticles is about 107. The boundary condi-

tions are absorbing in all directions for both the electromagnetic (EM) radiation and the

quasiparticles. The space and time units are the wavelength λ and the period 2π/ω of the

incident radiation.

Under the conditions of simulations as in the case of the above discussed experiment the

laser pulse length is approximately 4 times larger than the wake wavelength, 2πc/ωpe, and the

observed laser pulse evolution corresponds to the development of the self-modulation regime.

According to Ref.

[5] in this regime the modulational instability results in the laser pulse

modulations in the longitudinal direction and in the generation of the wake plasma wake in

and behind the laser pulse. In Fig. 4 we present the electron density distribution in the (x, y)

plane at t = 300, which shows a regular structure in the wake plasma wave left behind the

laser pulse. The wake wave has a ﬁnite length, which corresponds to the ﬁnite time required

5

for the modulational instability development. In frame b) we plot the Ez component of the

electric ﬁeld along the laser pulse axis, y = 0, for t = 300. This clearly demonstrates that the

initially Gaussian laser pulse becomes modulated with a modulation wavelength equal to the

wake wave wavelength and its maximal amplitude becomes substantially higher, by a factor

larger than 2, than the initial pulse amplitude.

In frame c) we present the longitudinal,

Ex, component of the electric ﬁeld along the laser pulse axis, y = 0, for t = 300, which

characterizes the evolution of the wake wave structure. We point out that the wake ﬁeld

has a regular structure behind the laser pulse over a distance substantially longer than the

laser pulse length (see Fig. 4 c)).

The dependence of the electron energy spectrum on the target density found from the

PIC simulations (see Fig. 3 b)) has a behavior similar to that in the experiment, which is

seen in Fig. 3 (a). This clearly demonstrates the typicalness of the electron acceleration

regime realized in the present work.

In Fig. 5, projections of the electron phase space, a) plane (x, px), b) plane (y, px), and

c) plane (x, py), at t = 400 are plotted. The transverse wake wave breaking of multiple wake

cycles results in the electron injection into the acceleration phase with the production of

multiple fast electron bunches seen in Fig. 5 a). At the time about t = 400 the electrons

reach their maximal energy of the order of 30 MeV. The electrons with the maximal energy

are accelerated in the 2-nd wake period, as seen in the electron phase plane, (x, px), presented

in Fig. 5 a). The electron injection occurs not in the ﬁrst cycle of the wake wave according

to the theory of the transverse wake wave breaking, which predicts that in a tenuous plasma

the wake wave breaks at a ﬁnite distance behind the wake wave front, [10]. In Figs. 5 a)

and c) we indicate by the dashed line the position of the laser pulse leading edge. It is at

x = 375 and ﬁrst electron bunch is localized at x = 365. The electron energy spectrum

has the form of a quasi-monoenergetic bunch with a maximum at 20 MeV (see Fig. 3 b),

and width ≈ 20%. The experimentally obtained form of the quasi-monoenergetic electron

beam as seen in Fig. 1 is in good agreement with these results. Phase planes b) (y, px)

and c) (x, py), show that spatially separated bunches are accelerated in subsequent wake

wave periods. In the frames a) and b) the arrows A and B indicate the spatially separated

electron beamlets, which also have diﬀerent energies. In the (x, py) phase plane c), arrows

indicate the aside beamlets. Inside the 2-nd wake period, a quasi-monoenergetic electron

bunch with its energy of about 20 MeV is generated (indicated by the arrow A).

6

In addition, broadened quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with energy approximately

equal to 10 MeV can be seen in the 2-nd and 3-rd wake periods (indicated by the arrow B).

These features are in suﬃciently good agreement with the multiple quasi-mono energetic

electron beam production observed in our experiments and shown in Fig.2 (a). In addition,

2D-PIC simulations also demonstrate the bending of electron beam bunches. The trans-

verse electron momentum versus the x-coordinate is shown in Fig. 5 c). We can see that

the electron bunches in the 3-rd wake period have ﬁnite transverse momentum beamlets

(indicated by the arrows) and have the y-component of their momentum equal to approxi-

mately 4. This corresponds to the generic property of the wakeﬁeld acceleration, when the

electron is trapped both in the longitudinal and transverse directions. According to Ref.[1]

the characteristic timescale of the electron longitudinal motion is equal to the acceleration
time, tacc = ω−1
ph. Here γph = ω/ωpe is the gamma factor associated with the wake wave
phase velocity, vph, i.e. γph = 1/q1 − (vph/c)2 (see for details review article [11] and quoted
literature). In the transverse direction, the electrons being injected with a ﬁnite transverse

pe γ2

momentum (see Refs.

[10, 12]), move along a wiggling trajectory, also called betatron os-

cillations, in which the frequency and amplitude change, with a typical timescale given by
tb = ω−1

ph is the fast electron relativistic gamma factor. We point out

[13], where γe ≈ γ2

pe γ1/2

e

that the beam transverse dynamics determines its transverse emittance (e.g. see Ref. [14]).

From the 2D-PIC simulation results, presented in Fig. 5, the electron beam divergence is

estimated to be in the range from 10 to 20 mrad, which is in suﬃciently good agreement

with the experimental data as seen in Fig. 2 (b).

V. SUMMARY

In conclusion, when a 3 TW laser beam with a pulse duration equal to 70 fs is focused

by a f/13 Oﬀ-Axis-Parabolic mirror into a He gas jet target of length 600 µm, the quasi-

monoenergetic electron electron beams are observed. By changing the target plasma density

the fast electron energy and their energy spectrum change in a controllable way. The 2D

PIC simulations demonstrate that the wake ﬁeld generation occurs in the self-modulated

laser wake ﬁeld acceleration regime when multiple fast electron bunch generation occurs and

the bunches are well localized both in energy and coordinate space. The PIC simulations

qualitatively reproduce the dependence of the experimentally observed energy spectrum on

7

the plasma density.

Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence:
Generalized Energy Spectra

Abstract A general framework that incorporates the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK)
and Goldreich-Sridhar (GS) phenomenalogies of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) tur-
bulence is developed. This aﬀords a clariﬁcation of the regimes of validity of IK and
GS phenomenalogies and hence help resolve some controversies in this problem.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ﬂows that occur naturally (like astrophysical sit-
uations) and in modern technological systems (like fusion reactors) show turbulence.
Early theoretical investigations of MHD turbulence considered the isotropic case. On
the latter premise, Iroshnikov [1] and Kraichnan [2] (IK) made arguments ´a la Kol-
mogorov [3] and proposed that statistical properties of the small-scale components of
the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds

*are controlled by the shear Alfv´en wave dynamics;
*show, in the limit of large viscous and magnetic Reynolds numbers, some
universality in the inertial range.

and gave for the total energy spectral density E(k), the behavior E(k)
2 . Mont-
gomery et al.
[4] and [5], Goldreich and Sridhar [6] - [8] (GS) pointed out that the
isotropy assumption in the IK theory is not a very sound one in the MHD case, thanks
to the magnetic ﬁeld of the large-scale eddies, and gave for the energy spectrum in

the plane transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld the behavior E(k⊥)
⊥ [8]. However,
DNS of MHD turbulence in a strong applied magnetic ﬁeld (Maron and Goldreich
[9], Muller et al. [10] and [11]) showed that the transverse energy spectrum is close

al. [14], Goldstein et al. [15]) conﬁrm the GS spectrum E(k⊥)
⊥ . A resolution
of this apparent conﬂict requires clariﬁcation of the regimes of validity of IK and
GS phenomenalogies which is the objective of this paper. A general framework that
incorporates IK and GS phenomenalogies is developed to accomplish this objective.
The IK and GS hypotheses can be shown to follow from the formal analogy between
the hydrodynamic and MHD spectral energy density expressions.

Let us write the spectral energy density E(k) as

V being given the characteristic velocity of the spectral element k. The hydrodynamic
eddy turn-over time τ given by

then becomes

(2) implies that the energy transfer in the hydrodynamic case is local in the spectral
space which reﬂects the fact that a large-scale velocity ﬁeld can be transformed away
via Galilean invariance.

If we use the relation

∼
ε being the mean energy transfer rate, (3) leads to the Kolmogorov [16] spectrum

One may write for the MHD case, in analogy with (1) (Shivamoggi [17]),

total magnetic ﬁeld -

Combining (6) with (3), we obtain

(9) implies that the energy transfer in the MHD case is non-local in the spectral space
which reﬂects the fact that a large-scale magnetic ﬁeld cannot be transformed away
via Galilean invariance [2]. We have from (9) further

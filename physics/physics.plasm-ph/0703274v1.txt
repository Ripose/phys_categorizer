In a two-dimensional version of the modiﬁed Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW)
model, which describes electrostatic resistive drift wave turbulence, the
resistive coupling between vorticity and density does not act on the
zonal components (ky = 0). It is therefore necessary to modify the HW
model to treat the zonal components properly. The modiﬁed equations
are solved numerically, and visualization and analysis of the solutions
show generation of stable zonal ﬂows, through conversion of turbulent
kinetic energy, and the consequent turbulence and transport suppres-
sion. It is demonstrated by comparison that the modiﬁcation is essential
for generation of zonal ﬂows.

1. Introduction

In quasi two-dimensional (2D) plasma and ﬂuid ﬂows the energy ﬂux from
small scale turbulent modes toward lower wavenumber modes can domi-
nate the classical Kolmogorov cascade to dissipative scales, with the result
that energy can accumulate in large scale coherent structures. Zonal ﬂows
in planetary atmospheres and in magnetically conﬁned fusion plasmas are
well-known examples of such coherent structures. Quasi two-dimensional
ﬂuid systems in which turbulent activities and coherent structures interact
can undergo a spontaneous transition to a turbulence-suppressed regime.
In plasmas such transitions dramatically enhance the conﬁnement and are
known as L–H or conﬁnement transitions. From theoretical and experimen-
tal works the importance of shear or zonal ﬂows for suppression of cross-ﬁeld
transport and conﬁnement improvement is now widely appreciated.

Several low-dimensional dynamical models, comprised of a small num-

ber of coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations, have been proposed to de-
scribe and predict the L–H transition1,2,3. Ball et al. have analyzed a
three-variable model using bifurcation and singularity theories3. The model
is based on the reduced resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations with
the electrostatic approximation, and describes the pressure-gradient-driven
turbulence–shear ﬂow energetics. This approach using low-dimensional
modeling greatly simpliﬁes the problem, and when validated against simu-
lated or real experimental data, will provide an economical tool to predict
transitions over the parameter space.

In this work we report the results of numerical simulations that both
complement the low-dimensional modeling results and raise some interest-
ing issues in their own right. We focus on a model for electrostatic resistive
drift wave turbulence, the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) model4, and solve
the equations by direct numerical simulation in 2D slab geometry. The
HW model has been widely used to investigate anomalous edge transport
due to collisional drift waves5. Moreover, self-organization of a shear ﬂow
has been shown by numerical simulation of the HW model in cylindrical
geometry6. Thus we consider the HW model is a good starting point for
studying self-consistent turbulence–shear ﬂow interactions, even though it
does not describe physics that can be important in speciﬁc situations, such
as magnetic curvature, magnetic shear, and electromagnetic eﬀect.

2. Modiﬁed Hasegawa-Wakatani Model

The physical setting of the HW model may be considered as the edge region
of a tokamak plasma of nonuniform density n0 = n0(x) and in a constant
equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld B = B0∇z. Following the drift wave ordering7,
the density n = n0 + n1 and the electrostatic potential ϕ perpendicular
to the magnetic ﬁeld are governed by the continuity equation for ions or
electrons and the ion vorticity equation,

tive derivative (V E ≡ −∇⊥ϕ × ∇z/B0, E = −∇⊥ϕ), m is the ion mass,
jz is the current density in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. The conti-
nuity equation (1) can refer to ions and electrons because ∇ · j = 0 under
the quasineutral condition, and (2) holds because the current density is

divergence-free. Since the ion inertia is negligible in the parallel direction
(z), the parallel current is determined by the Ohm’s law,

If the parallel heat conductivity is suﬃciently large, the electrons may be
treated as isothermal: pe = nTe (p is the pressure, T is the temperature,
and subscript e refers to electrons.) This gives the parallel current as

ity. We omit ⊥, and use ∇ for the 2D derivative. The dissipative terms
with constant coeﬃcients Dζ and Dn have been included as adjuncts
without derivation, for numerical stability. The background density is as-
sumed to have an unchanging exponential proﬁle: κ ≡ −(∂/∂x) ln n0.
α ≡ −Te/(ηn0ωcie2)∂2/∂z2 is the adiabaticity operator describing the par-
allel electron response. In a 2D setting the coupling term operator α be-
comes a constant coeﬃcient, or parameter, by the replacement ∂/∂z → ikz.
This resistive coupling term must be treated carefully in a 2D model be-
cause zonal components of ﬂuctuations (the ky = kz = 0 modes) do not
contribute to the parallel current8. Recalling that the tokamak edge turbu-
lence is considered here, ky = 0 should always coincide with kz = 0 because
any potential ﬂuctuation on the ﬂux surface is neutralized by parallel elec-
tron motion. Let us deﬁne zonal and non-zonal components of a variable f
as

where Ly is the periodic length in y, and remove the contribution by the
zonal components in the resistive coupling term in (6) and (7). By sub-
tracting the zonal components from the resistive coupling term α(ϕ − n) →

where f stands for ζ and n, and D stands for the corresponding dissipation
coeﬃcients.

The HW model spans two limits with respect to the adiabaticity
parameter. In the adiabatic limit α → ∞ (collisionless plasma), the
non-zonal component of electron density obeys the Boltzmann relation
˜n = n0(x) exp( ˜ϕ), and the equations are reduced to the Hasegawa-Mima
equation7. In the hydrodynamic limit α → 0 and the equations are decou-
pled. Vorticity is determined by the 2D Navier-Stokes (NS) equation, and
the density ﬂuctuation is passively advected by the ﬂow obtained from the
NS equation.

In the ideal limit (α = ∞, Dζ = Dn = 0) the modiﬁed HW system has

two dynamical invariants, the energy E and the potential enstrophy W ,

E =

(n2 + |∇ϕ|2)dx, W =

(n − ζ)2dx,

where dx = dxdy, which constrain the ﬂuid motion. According to Kraich-
nan’s theory of 2D turbulence9, the net ﬂux of enstrophy is downscale
while that of energy is upscale. This inverse energy cascade is behind the
development of large scale, stable coherent structures in a HW ﬂow.

thus only Γn can act as a source. The energy absorbed from the background
supplies the turbulent ﬂuctuations through the drift wave instability.

2.1. Linear Stability Analysis

Since the zonal modes have linearly decaying solutions, we only consider
the form ei(kxx+kyy−ωt) (ky 6= 0). Linearization of the equations (9) and

and is depicted in Fig. 1. The left panel shows the stability boundary in
Dζ − κ plane. If we enhance the drive by increasing κ, the system becomes
unstable. However, the instability is stabilized by increasing the dissipation.
The stability threshold in kx − ky plane is shown in the right panel. We
see that in a highly driven-dissipative system only low wavenumber modes
are unstable. The stability boundary in parameter space is a region where
interesting dynamics are expected to occur, such as bifurcations or sudden
changes to a suppressed (or enhanced) turbulence regime.

Figure 2 shows the dispersion relation for cases where Dζ = Dn = 0. To
provide a test of the simulation code, we plot growth rates obtained from
numerical simulations together with the analytic curves. We can see that
the growth rates obtained numerically agree very well with that calculated
analytically. We also note that, in the parameter range plotted in Fig. 2
(α = 1, κ = 1), the most unstable mode is kx ∼ 0, ky ∼ 1.

3. Simulation Results

The HW equations are solved in a double periodic slab domain with box size
(2L)2 = (2π/∆k)2 where the lowest wavenumber ∆k = 0.15. The equations
are discretized on 256 × 256 grid points by the ﬁnite diﬀerence method.
Arakawa’s method is used for evaluation of the Poisson bracket10. Time
stepping algorithm is the third order explicit linear multistep method11.

Since we are focusing in this work on how the modiﬁcation (9), (10)
inﬂuences nonlinearly saturated states, we ﬁx the parameters to κ = 1,
Dζ = 10−6, α = 1, and Pr = 1, and compare the results obtained using
the MHW model with those computed from the OHW model. For these
parameters the system is unstable for most wavenumbers. During a typical
evolution, initial small amplitude perturbations grow linearly until the non-
linear terms begin to dominate. Then the system arrives at a nonlinearly
saturated state where the energy input Γn and output due to the resistivity
Γα and the dissipations DE,W balance.

In Fig. 3, we contrast the zonally elongated structure of the saturated
electrostatic potential computed from the MHW model with the strong
isotropic vortices in that from the OHW model. Time evolution of the
kinetic energy EK = 1/2
|∇ϕ|2dx, and its partition to the zonal and the
non-zonal components are shown in Fig. 4. The saturated kinetic energy
is not aﬀected by the modiﬁcation (EK ∼ 1 for both cases). In the OHW
model, the zonal ﬂow grows in the linear phase, as well as the other modes,
up to a few percent of the kinetic energy, and saturates. On the other hand,

in the MHW model the zonal kinetic energy continues to grow after the
linear phase, and dominates the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy contained
in other modes decreases to a few percent of the total kinetic energy. In the
original 2D HW model, the resistive coupling term is retained for the zonal
modes, the eﬀect of which is to prevent development of zonal ﬂows. But
since the zonal modes do not carry parallel currents it is clearly unphysical

once the zonal ﬂow is generated in the MHW model, the transport level is
signiﬁcantly suppressed. The transport suppression is mostly because the
saturated potential energy (or amplitude of saturated density ﬂuctuation)
is reduced. The potential energy and the turbulence kinetic energy are con-
verted into the zonal kinetic energy. By contrast the energy of the OHW
model is almost equi-partitioned between the kinetic and potential energy.

where Kx, Ky are the highest wavenumbers. The spectra of the modiﬁed
model again show strong anisotropic structure whereas there is no marked
diﬀerence in the original HW model. In the modiﬁed model, potential energy
stored in the background density is converted into turbulent kinetic energy
through the drift wave instability at ky ∼ 1, kx = 0 and then is distributed
to smaller wavenumbers. The drift wave structure, which is elongated in
the x direction, is break up into rather isotropic vortices after the nonlinear
eﬀect sets in, and those isotropic vortices merge in the y direction to produce
the zonal ﬂow. We can recognize this non-negligible inverse energy cascade
in the y direction from a slight negative slope of Ex(ky) spectrum in ky . 1

wave number kx ∼ 0.45.

4. Conclusion

We have performed nonlinear simulations of the 2D HW model. As sug-
gested recently8, the electron response parallel to the background magnetic
ﬁeld must be treated carefully in the 2D model. The model should be mod-
iﬁed to exclude the zonal (ky = 0) contribution from the resistive coupling
term. By comparing the numerical results of the modiﬁed and the unmod-
iﬁed original HW models, we have revealed that a remarkable zonal ﬂow
structure in the nonlinearly saturated state is only observed in the modiﬁed
model. Thus, the modiﬁcation is crucial to the generation of the zonal ﬂow
in this model. Time evolutions of the macroscopic quantities, such as the
energies and ﬂuxes show that, after the zonal ﬂow is built up by turbulent
interaction, the generated zonal ﬂow signiﬁcantly suppresses the turbulent
ﬂuctuation level and the cross-ﬁeld density transport.

The build up of the zonal ﬂow and resulting transport suppression in-
dicate bifurcation structure of the system. If we increase a parameter (say,

sition from a high transport to a low transport regime. The state shown
in this paper can be a bifurcated state. A systematic parameter study and
comparison with the low-dimensional dynamical model are possible next
steps.

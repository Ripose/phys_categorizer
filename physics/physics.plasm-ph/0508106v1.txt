Abstract

We study stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in laser-fusion conditions with the
Eulerian Vlasov code ELVIS. Back SRS from homogeneous plasmas occurs in sub-
picosecond bursts and far exceeds linear theory. Forward SRS and re-scatter of back
SRS are also observed. The plasma wave frequency downshifts from the linear dis-
persion curve, and the electron distribution shows ﬂattening. This is consistent with
trapping and reduces the Landau damping. There is some acoustic (ω ∝ k) activity
and possibly electron acoustic scatter. Kinetic ions do not aﬀect SRS for early times
but suppress it later on. SRS from inhomogeneous plasmas exhibits a kinetic enhance-
ment for long density scale lengths. More scattering results when the pump propagates
to higher as opposed to lower density.

Introduction and Code Model

Laser-plasma interactions must be controlled for inertial fusion to succeed. This paper
examines stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), or the parametric coupling of a pump light
wave (the laser, mode 0) to a daughter light wave (mode 1) and an electron plasma wave
(EPW, mode 2). Kinetic eﬀects, such as electron trapping, in the daughter EPW are seen
to be important in back SRS (BSRS). 1-D kinetic simulations presented here show BSRS
much greater than coupled-mode theory for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasmas.
Strong nonlinearity and non-thermal electron distributions are seen to result.

ELVIS [1] is a 1-D Eulerian Vlasov code that evolves the distribution function fs (s =
species; e for electrons) on a ﬁxed phase-space grid. It uses operator splitting for the time
advance [2], [3] and cubic spline interpolation for shifting fs in position (x) and momentum
(px). Light waves are linearly polarized in y. The ions can be immobile or kinetic. The
governing equations are

[∂t + (px/ms)∂x + (Zse) (Ex + vysBz) ∂px] fs = νKs (x) (cid:16)ns ˆf0s − fs(cid:17)

2 Simulations Results

0/ω2

We simulate a pump laser with λ0 = 351 nm (vacuum) and intensity I0 = 2 × 1015 W/cm2
impinging from the left (E+ contains the pump) on a ﬁnite plasma with a ﬂat central region
75.1 µm wide of density n0 = 0.1nc (critical density nc = n0ω2
p) and temperature Te = 3
keV. Since Vlasov codes are low-noise there are no numerical ﬂuctuations for SRS to grow
from. We therefore inject a counter-propagating seed light wave via E− with λ1s = 574 nm
and I1 = 10−5I0. This light has the maximum linear BSRS growth rate and couples to an
EPW with k2λD = 0.357 and a Landau damping rate ν2 = 0.038ωp (λD = vT e/ωp, v2
T e =
Te/me). The x grid spacing is dx = 11.9 nm, our algorithm requires dt = dx/c, and we use
a px grid spacing dp = 0.0437vT eme. SRS is convective for these parameters with a spatial
gain rate α = 0.019 µm−1, giving a linear reﬂectivity Rlin = 1.72 × 10−4. The numerical R,
shown as the solid curve in Fig. 1(a), is well above this level. R comes in sub-picosecond
bursts and has a time average from 1 ps to the run end of Rav = 13.8%. νKs 6= 0 only at the
edges. Repeating the run with a nonzero central νKs shows a sharp cutoﬀ of the reﬂectivity
for νKs & 10−3ωp.

The streaked spectrum of reﬂected light E− at the left edge is shown in Fig. 1(b).
Almost all the energy is contained in BSRS. ω1s = 1.93ωp is the seed light frequency.
Initially BSRS occurs at ω1s but upshifts for t & 2 ps, corresponding to a downshift in ω2.
The weak signal near ωp labeled “Fre” is the forward Raman re-scatter of upshifted BSRS
light. The longitudinal Ex spectrum in Fig. 2(a) reveals the plasma wave at the matching k
and ω. Re-scatter is only possible due to the upshift in ω1, since ωp > ω1s/2. The features
slightly below ω0 and slightly above 2.5ωp, labeled “SEAS?”, may be related to scattering oﬀ
the acoustic longitudinal activity discussed below [4]. The transmitted light (E+) spectrum

(not presented here) shows for t &3 ps weak levels of both FSRS and the anti-Stokes line
(ω = ω0 + ωp) of the pump, even though neither of these is externally seeded.

The longitudinal electric ﬁeld spectrum Ex(k, ω), depicted in Fig. 2(a), reveals that the
BSRS plasma-wave activity is downshifted in frequency from the linear dispersion curve.
This is qualitatively consistent with the frequency downshift due to electron trapping [5],
and periods of larger downshift correspond to larger EPW amplitude. The downshifted
EPW connects with an acoustic-like feature (ω ∝ k) that extends to ω = 0. There is
another, lower phase velocity acoustic streak, strongest for ω . 0.2ωp. Weak scattering
oﬀ them may account for the “SEAS?” features in Fig. 1(b). In addition, plasma waves
corresponding to FSRS and re-scatter of BSRS occur on the EPW dispersion curve. Fig.
2(b) presents the t and x rms-averaged Ex(x, t), which shows the EPWs occur as a series
of wide pulses that move parallel to the laser (that is, to the right). The group velocity
matches the slope of the BSRS plasma waves. Near the left edge some pulses propagate
opposite the laser.

The electron distribution fe forms phase-space vortices at the EPW phase velocity vp2 =
ω2/k2 (=0.264c for the linear EPW). The space-averaged hfei, displayed in Fig. 3(a), is
ﬂattened due to trapping in this region. Landau damping (∼ ∂f /∂v) is greatly reduced by
ﬂattening, which may thereby enhance the reﬂectivity [6]. When the EPW amplitude is
large fe is quite ﬂat, and only for brief periods (. 0.1 ps) do we see a small bump (region
of ∂hfei/∂px > 0) form slightly above vp2.

The run was repeated with kinetic helium ions (mi = 4mp, Ti = 750 eV) and yielded
the dotted R in Fig. 1(a). Early in time R is the same for immobile and kinetic ions, while
later in time they diverge. For the last 2 ps the reﬂectivity is very low with kinetic ions.
We do not see evidence of Langmuir decay instability (EPW → EPW + IAW (ion acoustic
wave)) of the EPW or stimulated Brillouin scattering (photon → photon + IAW) of the
pump. Instead, very high Ex activity develops on the left edge of the box around t = 5 ps,
involving large ion density ﬂuctuations; BSRS is minimal after this. Most of the spectral
power in this activity is concentrated in the FSRS and re-scatter of BSRS features. Further
study of the role of ions is underway.

In an inhomogeneous medium, the k matching condition k0 = k1 + k2 for a three-wave
interaction can only be satisﬁed at one point. Away from this point the detuning limits the
interaction. We performed ELVIS simulations for the same parameters as the homogeneous
run with kinetic ions discussed above. However, the central region of the density proﬁle now
has a linear gradient extending for 100 µm. We vary the endpoint densities and thereby

change the density scale length Ln = n/(dn/dx). The reﬂectivities for several Ln are
shown in Fig. 3(b), for the pump propagating toward higher and lower densities. Also
plotted is the steady-state R predicted from the coupled-mode equations, solved in the
limit of strong damping for the EPW (solid curve) as well as the Rosenbluth undamped
result (dashed curve). Both coupled-mode calculations give the same R for both directions
of pump propagation, yet the simulation consistently shows higher R for ~k0||∇n. We are
formulating a theory to explain the high R and the role of pump propagation direction.

3 Conclusions

Vlasov simulations of SRS show strong enhancement of the scattering over coupled-mode
predictions for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasmas. The resulting plasma waves
do not satisfy the linear dispersion relation. The electron distribution shows large trapping
and ﬂattening. The role of sideloss and ions need to be further examined, and analytic
models that explain these ﬁndings need to be developed.

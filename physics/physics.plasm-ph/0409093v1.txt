Abstract

We use the Hopf mapping to construct a magnetic conﬁguration consisting of closed
ﬁeld lines, each of which is linked with all the other ones. We obtain in this way a
solution of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics of an ideal incompressible ﬂuid
with inﬁnite conductivity, which describes a localized topological soliton.

Introduction

Solutions of physical equations which have non-trivial topological properties have been stud-
ied for already more than ﬁve years. As examples we may give the “monopole” [1,2] and
the “instanton” [3] in gauge ﬁeld theories and the “pseudoparticle” in a two-dimensional
isotropic ferromagnet [4]. All these solutions are characterized by some topological index:
the magnetic charge of the monopole and the number of pseudoparticles in the ferromag-
net are equal to the degree of mapping of a two-dimensional sphere onto a two-dimensional
sphere, the number of instantons is equal to the Pontryagin index of the mapping of the
SU(2) group onto the three-dimensional sphere. In each case one can write this index as a
volume integral of some “topological charge density”. In this connection attention is drawn
to the integral of motion [5]

(A is the vector potential) which has been known for a long time in the magnetohydro-
dynamics of a perfectly conducting ﬂuid and which is called the helicity of the magnetic
ﬁeld. Its topological nature is already indicated by the fact that no characteristics of the
medium in which the magnetic ﬁeld is present enter into (1). It has also been shown (see
[6,7]) that if two ﬁeld line tubes are linked the integral (1) is proportional to their
Refs.
linkage coeﬃcient, i.e., the number of times which one tube is twisted around the other one.
It is thus clear that the helicity is a topological characteristic of the magnetic ﬁeld. This
topological nature of it is completely revealed if we note that (1) is the same as the Whitehead
integral for the Hopf invariant which characterizes topologically diﬀerent mappings of the
three-dimensional sphere S3 onto the two-dimensional S2 [8–10]. The topological meaning

it is equal to the linkage coeﬃcient of the curves in S3
of the Hopf invariant is simple:
which are the originals of diﬀerent points of S2. Hence follows also a more constructive
conclusion: knowing the mapping S3
S2 with a non-zero Hopf invariant, and the simplest
such mapping was constructed by Hopf himself, we can ﬁnd the vector ﬁeld A corresponding
to it and, then, the magnetic ﬁeld H = rotA with non-zero helicity. The magnetic ﬁeld lines
of this ﬁeld will be closed and each of them is linked with any other one. In the present
paper we construct one such magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration and we study its properties in
magnetohydrodynamics.

2 Stereographic projection and Hopf mapping

We establish ﬁrst of all the connection between the physical space R3 and the sphere S3.
Equation (1) implies that the ﬁeld H decreases suﬃciently fast at inﬁnity so that the helicity
I is a gauge-invariant quantity: adding to A the gradient of any function does not change I as
the additional term after integration by parts gives a surface term which does not contribute
because H decreases rapidly, and a volume term which vanishes because divH = 0. If the
other physical conditions at inﬁnity are also unique (say, we consider a homogeneous isotropic
medium) we may assume that the Euclidean three-dimensional space R3 is supplemented
by a point at inﬁnity. Such a “compacted” space becomes topologically equivalent to the
three-dimensional sphere S3. If we embed S3 in the four-dimensional Euclidean space with
coordinates (uµ; µ = 1, 2, 3, 4) so that S3 =
we can establish the connection
between R3 and S3 by the stereographic projection

uµ : u2

µ = 1

}

{

xi =

,

i = 1, 2, 3.

It is clear that the point at inﬁnity corresponds to the “south pole” of the sphere with
coordinates (0, 0, 0,

1). The inverse transformation is realized by the formulae

where x2 = x2

Let there now be in R3 a vector ﬁeld A = (A1, A2, A3). We ﬁnd the formulae which

express the connection between A and the corresponding vector ﬁeld

This condition means that both A and
Aµ also lie in the tangent spaces to the appropriate
conﬁguration spaces R3 and S3. We now use the condition for the invariance of the diﬀerential
form 1

to three. Taking as the independent variables on S3 the ﬁrst three Cartesian coordinates ui

We now describe how, using the known mapping f : S3

S2, one must construct the
vector ﬁeld A which corresponds to it and which occurs in Eq. (1) for the Hopf invariant
of this mapping. One must, as was shown by Whitehead (see Ref. [9] and also Ref. [13]),
start from the 2-form of the volume on the unit sphere S2. If that sphere is embedded in
the three-dimensional Euclidean space with coordinates ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, the 2-form of the volume
has the form

(
is the exterior product sign); the coeﬃcient is here chosen in such a way that the integral
∧
of (9) over the sphere S2 equals to unity. The mapping f induces a mapping f ∗ in the
opposite direction from the space of forms on S2 onto the space of forms on S3 so that one
can ﬁnd the 2-form f ∗ω2 on S3. One can show that any 2-form on S3 can be written in the
form of an exterior diﬀerential of some 1-form ω1 where ω1 is determined uniquely up to a
diﬀerential of an arbitrary function. We thus can ﬁnd a form ω1 such that f ∗ω2 = dω1. By
using a stereographic projection, we can associate with a vector ﬁeld on S3, determined by
the form ω1, a vector ﬁeld A in R3 which we can use to evaluate the Hopf invariant through
Eq. (1).

We now consider the Hopf mapping f : S3

S2 which has a Hopf invariant equal to

unity (see Refs. [8,13]):

3 Magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration

We thus ﬁnd, starting from the vector ﬁeld (13) and using (8) and (3) a vector potential in
the three-dimensional physical space. We note that Eqs. (3) are clearly written in dimen-
sionless form, i.e., all coordinates xi refer to some characteristic dimension R. To change
xi/R, but in order to keep the
to dimensional units we must make the substitution xi →
formulae simple we stay in this section with dimensionless length units. The dimensional
coeﬃcient of proportionality which ﬁxes the absolute value of the magnetic ﬁeld strength
has also so far been dropped. As a result of substituting (13) and (3) into (8) we get, apart
from a proportionality factor

u3 = sin(φ + φ0),

u4 = cos(φ + φ0),

(21)

where the integration constants a and b are connected through the relation a2 + b2 = 1.

Again using (2) to change to the physical space we ﬁnd that the solution of the set (18)

has the form

x1 =

a cos(φ + φ1)
1 + b cos(φ + φ0)

x2 =

and return to the initial point. Substituting (22) into (23) we get

Expressing the trigonometric functions in (22) in terms of tan[(φ+φ1)/2] and substituting

the general formulae in view of their complexity, but restrict ourselves to the case φ1 = φ0

Although it follows from the way we have constructed the circles that they are linked,
it is of interest to verify this also directly. We therefore consider two circles: C1 and C2
corresponding to values of the parameters a = b = √2, φ1 = 0 and diﬀerent values φ0 = 0
and φ0 = π/2 (one circle is rotated with respect to the other over π/2 around the x3-axis).
Their parametric equations have the form

ﬁnds that C1 intersects this line at the points A1 = (

When the parameter φ0 changes from 0 to π/2 the circle is shifted in space from C1 to C2
covering a surface with boundaries C1 and C2 which can be obtained by joining two ends of
a strip after twisting it over 360o. It is known (and one can easily verify this experimentally)
that if one cuts such a strip along its boundaries following a closed line it falls apart into two
such strips which are linked. Continuing this cutting exercise we shall obtain ever narrower
strips which are linked with one another. It thus becomes clear that all circles forming the
original strip are linked with one another.

When the parameter φ0 changes from 0 to 2π the circle describes a closed surface (a torus
obtained from a cylinder which is twisted 360o before it ends are joined) which is bounding

a “plait” of closed lines of force. The lines of force thus lie on toroidal surfaces which are
imbedded one into another, and are circles, each of which is linked with all the others.

We now consider a physical system in which the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration which we

have described can be realized.

We shall consider a perfectly conducting liquid for which I is an integral of motion.
We also restrict ourselves to the case of an incompressible ideal ﬂuid. The equations of
magnetohydrodynamics for stationary ﬂow have the form (see, e.g., Ref. [14])

For a physical interpretation of topological solitons we must bear in mind that they are
metastable states, the energy of which is higher than the energy of a state at complete
equilibrium. It is thus necessary for the stability of a soliton, at any rate, that there does
not exist such a continuous deformation at which its energy diminishes while the topological
invariant is conserved. Comparison of (38) and (34) shows that

E

∝

I

so that the soliton can diminish its energy for constant I by increasing its radius. However,
in the case considered there is yet another integral of motion—the angular momentum [we

which stabilizes the “spreading” of the soliton (cf. the remarks about “collapse” of solitons
in Refs. [16, 17]).

The radius R and the ﬁeld H0 are completely determined by the two conserved quantities

I and M:

R = (M 2/4πρI)1/4, H0 = 8(ρ/π)1/2I/M.

(39)
M −1/2.
For given I, the M-dependence of the energy has a speciﬁc decreasing spectrum, E
One must, however, bear in mind that I and M are not completely independent quantities.
As the pressure is always positive, it follows from (37) and (33) that

∝

and thus, according to (39), I and M must satisfy the thermodynamic inequality

For a given external pressure p∞ the radius and energy of the soliton satisfy thus the

inequalities

Combining these inequalities [or substituting (40) into (38)] gives

which is essentially the same as the well known inequality E < 3pV which follows from the
fact that the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is positive (see Refs. [18,19]).

5 Conclusion

→

The equations of magnetohydrodynamics thus admit of an exact solution which describes a
localized topological soliton. This kind of solution has already been met with in the physics
of the condensed state (see, e.g., Refs. [16,17]). We note here some diﬀerence between the
magnetohydrodynamic soliton and, say, a soliton in a ferromagnet [17]. In a ferromagnet the
mapping S3
S2 is realized by the order parameter—the magnetization vector m(x). Here
the sphere S2 has a direct physical meaning, namely, it is the conﬁguration space of the vector
m. At the same time the map of a point from S2 has no special physical meaning—it is the
line on which m(x) takes a constant value and the Hopf invariant characterizes the linking
of such lines. In magnetohydrodynamics there is no ordering parameter and the sphere S2
has a completely arbitrary character: its points merely “number” the magnetic lines of force
and the correspondence between the lines of force and the points on S2 is established by the
Hopf mapping S3
S2. This mapping is not realized in such an apparent manner as in
the case of a soliton in a ferromagnet, but now the maps of the points of S2 have a direct
physical meaning—they are the magnetic lines of force, and the Hopf invariant characterizes
their linking.

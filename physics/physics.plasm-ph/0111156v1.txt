Abstract

New unstable temperature gradient driven modes in an inhomogeneous

plasma are identiﬁed. These modes represent transient ω

kkv(e,i)

th

sound

≃

oscillations in magnetized plasma that are kinetically destabilized via Landau

interactions. Electron and ion sound branches are unstable for large values of

the Larmor radius parameter k⊥ρe,i

1, respectively. The instability occurs

≫
due to a speciﬁc plasma response that signiﬁcantly deviates from Boltzmann

distribution in the region k⊥ρi,e

1 . Pacs: 52.35 Kt, 52.35 Qz

≫

Small scale instabilities driven by temperature gradients are believed to be responsible for

particle and energy transport in a tokamak. The ion temperature gradient driven turbulence

1

has been identiﬁed [1] as a primary cause of ion thermal transport. The electron temperature

gradient driven modes are believed to be largely responsible for the electron transport [2].

Both types of modes, the ion temperature gradient (ITG) and electron temperature gradient

(ETG), have been extensively studied over last decades [3–9] In basic slab geometry these

modes are essentially sound waves destabilized by coupling to pressure ﬂuctuations [3–7].

In toroidal geometry the modes are driven by the unfavourable magnetic curvature rather

than by acoustic oscillations, though the mode may remain essentially slab-like in the region

of the weak/negative shear [19,20].

In this work we report on a new mechanism of the

destabilization of the temperature gradient driven modes. The mechanism is essentially

related to the wave-particle Landau interaction. However, the most important element is

a newly found regime of plasma response for large values of the Larmor radius parameter,

⊥ρ2

1, α = (e, i). In this regime plasma response in essential way deviates from usually

assumed Boltzmann distribution for k2

occurs for transient (acoustic type) modes whose eigen-frequency ω

temperature gradient driven modes occur for k2

To illustrate existence of a new unstable mode we plot a solution of the dispersion equa-

eters to be exactly the same as in Ref. 17. The plasma pressure parameter β is deﬁned as

β = 8πn0Ti/B2

0. [Note that our deﬁnition of v2

thα and β diﬀer diﬀer from those in Ref. 17

by a factor of 2.] Figures 1a and 1b show the real ωr and imaginary ωi parts of the eigen

frequency, respectively. It is already evident from Figs 1a and 1b that there are exist two

distinct eigenmodes:

in Fig. 1b the left curve is the unstable ITG branch and the right

curve is the unstable drift mode branch [17] (in terminology of Ref. 17). Our results in Figs

1a and 1b are in complete agreement with Ref. 17.

To clarify the nature of the unstable branch we solve the dispersion equation as a function

of the kyρi parameter for ﬁxed β = 2

mode growth rate and mode frequency normalized to kkvthe are shown in Figs. 2a and 2b,

respectively. Two new unstable branches exist in the regions kyρi

1 and kyρe

1. The

≥

≥

standard ITG mode has a peak growth rate around kyρi

1, and the standard ETG mode

has a growth rate peaked at kyρi

40 (corresponding to kyρe

1). A new ion mode (ion

×

≃

KTG) has a maximum growth rate around kyρi

5, and a new electron mode (electron

≃

≃

≃

KTG) saturates to a constant growth rate quickly for large kyρi > 200 ( kyρe > 5). It is

essential to note that new modes exist in the regions of large Larmor radius parameters

(respectively, kyρi for the ion KTG, and kyρe for the electron ETG). As we show below,

kinetic temperature gradient modes occur due to a peculiar behaviour of the plasma response

in the region of large kyρα. Let us consider this response in more details.

A standard notion is that for large values of the Larmor radius parameter, kyρα > 1,

the density response of the respective plasma component is Boltzmann due to decaying

asymptotics of Γ0,1(bα)

1/√ba for large bα, so that we have from (3-4) Dα

∼

1, lα

1.

≃

≪

This, in fact, implicitly assumes that the ratio of ωnα/ω is ﬁnite for large kyρα. In turn,

this requires that the mode eigen-frequency increases with kyρα (linearly or faster). The

4

latter is deﬁnitely true for drift wave type modes, where ω

ω∗α. However, temperature

∼

gradient driven modes, are basically sound waves whose frequency is of the order of the

transient (or sound) frequency, kkvthα. If the parameter kkvthα remains constant (so ω is

approximately constant), the ratio ωnα/ω will be increasing with kyρα that may compensate

for the decaying 1/√ba factor from Γ0,1(bα). Then, for large kyρα

1 we may write in the

The electron KTG mode is a destabilized electron sound wave with ω

kkvthe so we retain

≃

a full plasma dispersion function in De to account for the electron Landau interactions. In

this region ω/kkvthi

(9) with simpliﬁed response functions (12-15) and λD = 0 is shown in Fig. 2 by squares. We

note here, that in fact plasma response is not given exactly by expressions (1-2) but contains

expressions (12-15) as long as ρi/Ln < 1.

A similar expansion can be made in the region kyρi

Mode growth rate and real frequency obtained with (18-21) and (9) with λD = 0 are

shown in Fig. 2 by circles.

Recently, it has been emphasised that the ETG modes can be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by

a ﬁnite value of the Debye length parameter [19]. Electron KTG mode is strongly stabilized

in a high temperature plasma by the ﬁnite Debye length as shown in Fig. 3. Note that eﬀect

of the Debye length screening may be diﬀerent for the negative shear plasma [19].

Though the modiﬁed ion response for large ion Larmor radius is criticial for the ion KTG

mode, the mode itself is destabilized by the electron temperature gradient as demonstrated

6

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

in Fig 4.

Ion KTG mode exists for large gradients of the electron temperarure (dashed

line, ηe = 5). The mode growth rate is signiﬁcantly reduced for smaller values of ηe (solid

line, ηe = 0.5). Thus we may conclude that ion KTG mode is in fact a hybrid mode, in

which both ion and electron response are essential. Electromagnetic eﬀects are expected to

be important for this mode existing in the intermediate region between standard ITG and

ETG modes. Though for larger ηe we observe a standard ﬁnite β suppression (curve labeled

by diamonds in Fig. 5), for low ηe = 0.5 , ﬁnite plasma pressure eﬀectively leads to the

extension of the ITG instability into the shorter wavelengths (curve labeled by squares in

Fig. 5). It is interesting to note that for β = 0.1 taken for this case, the skin depth size

c/ωpe

0.1 ρi, which makes kyc/ωpe

1 in the region of the unstable ion KTG.

≃

≤

In summary, we have identiﬁed two new branches of the temperature gradient driven

modes. These modes are closely related to acoustic type modes that are destabilized by

the temperature gradient eﬀects. A modiﬁed plasma response in the region of kyρα

1 is

≫

essential for new instability. There is certain similarity of the KTG modes to the universal

instability of drift waves that is driven by density gradient and wave-particle interaction

[21]. The KTG modes considered in this work will be aﬀected by a ﬁnite value of the

magnetic shear but noting a special role of the temperature gradients and the modiﬁed

plasma responce for kyρα

1 it remains unclear whether these modes can be stabilized by

≫

the shear similarly to the universal instability [22,23]. One can expect that KTG modes can

persist in the region of weak and/or negative magnetic shear where the mode structure is

essentially that of a shearless slab [20]. Toroidal eﬀects will further modify the KTG modes

but are not expected to cause their stabilization [24]. Generally, investigation of a general

case requires nonlocal integral analysis [13,15,19] that is left for future work.

Three dimensional (3D) relativistic electromagnetic sub-cycle solitons were observed in 3D
Particle-in-Cell simulations of an intense short laser pulse propagation in an underdense plasma.
Their structure resembles that of an oscillating electric dipole with a poloidal electric ﬁeld and a
toroidal magnetic ﬁeld that oscillate in-phase with the electron density with frequency below the
Langmuir frequency. On the ion time scale the soliton undergoes a Coulomb explosion of its core,
resulting in ion acceleration, and then evolves into a slowly expanding quasi-neutral cavity.

Time evolution of a three dimensional (3D) nonlinear
wave, in general, diﬀers drastically from that of 1D or
2D waves, as exempliﬁed by the problems of the wave
collapse [1] and of the transverse stability of solitons
[2]. Relativistic electromagnetic solitons are now rou-
tinely observed in 2D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations
[3, 4, 5, 6] in the wake of an intense short laser pulse
propagating in an underdense plasma. Solitons attract a
great attention because they are of fundamental impor-
tance for nonlinear science [7] and are considered to be a
basic component of turbulence in plasmas [8]. Thus the
numerical identiﬁcation of solitons, among the diﬀerent
kinds of coherent structures that are formed by an intense
laser pulse in a plasma, stimulated a renewed interest in
developing an analytical model [9, 10] and in envisaging
ways of detecting solitons experimentally [11].

As was stressed in Ref. [12], a detailed description of
the strong electromagnetic wave interaction with plasmas
represents a formidable diﬃculty for analytical methods,
due to the high dimensionality of the problem, the lack
of symmetry and the importance of nonlinear and ki-
netic eﬀects. On the other hand, powerful methods for
investigating the laser-plasma interaction have become
available through the advent of modern supercomput-
ers. In the case of an ultra-short relativistically strong

laser pulse, simulations with 3D PIC codes provide a
unique opportunity for describing the nonlinear dynam-
ics of laser plasmas adequately, including the generation
of coherent nonlinear structures, such as the relativistic
solitons. In this Letter we present numerical identiﬁca-
tion of a 3D subcycle relativistic soliton and complex
spatial structure of its electromagnetic ﬁelds.

Brieﬂy summarizing the recent results in the analyti-
cal and numerical investigation of relativistic solitons in
plasmas we recall the development of the analytical the-
ory of intense electromagnetic solitons [9, 10, 13], see also
references in Ref. [14]. The solitons found in 1D and 2D
simulations consist of slowly or non propagating electron
density cavities inside which an electromagnetic ﬁeld is
trapped and oscillates coherently with a frequency be-
low the unperturbed plasma frequency and with a spatial
structure corresponding to half a cycle. One-dimensional
sub-cycle relativistic electromagnetic solitons in an un-
derdense plasma were observed for the ﬁrst time in a
PIC simulation in Ref.
[15], where the mechanism of
soliton formation and the structure of the circularly po-
larized soliton were investigated. The mechanism of soli-
ton formation is related to the fact that the frequency
in the rear part of an intense laser pulse propagating
in an underdense plasma decreases down to the local
Langmuir frequency because the pulse loses its energy
while the number of photons is conserved. As a re-
sult, the low-frequency part of the electromagnetic ra-
diation of the pulse, propagating with very low velocity,
is trapped inside the cavity in the electron density, and a
sub-cycle soliton is formed. An exact analytical solution
of the electron ﬂuid – Maxwell equations representing 1D
circularly-polarized relativistic electromagnetic sub-cycle
soliton was obtained in Ref. [9] in perfect agreement with
1D PIC simulations. The 2D relativistic electromagnetic
sub-cycle solitons discovered in the PIC simulations [3]
consist of two “pure” types of solitons: S-solitons with
transverse electric ﬁeld and azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld with
respect to the symmetry axis, and P -solitons with the op-

direction of the z-axis and its dimensionless amplitude
is a = eEz/(meωc) = 1, corresponding to the peak in-
tensity I = 1.38 · 1018W/cm2 for the λ = 1µm laser.
The laser pulse has a gaussian envelope with FWHM
size 8λ × 5λ × 5λ. Its focal plane is placed in front of
the plasma slab at the distance of 3λ. The length of the
plasma slab is 13λ. The plasma density is ne = 0.36ncr.
Ions and electrons have the same absolute charge, and
the mass ratio is mi/me = 1836. The simulation box has
660 × 400 × 400 grids with a mesh size of 0.05λ. The
total number of quasiparticles is 426 · 106. The boundary
conditions are periodic along the y- and z-axes and ab-
sorbing along the x-axis for both the EM radiation and
the quasiparticles. The simulations were performed on
16 processors of the NEC SX-5 vector supercomputer in
Cybermedia Center, Osaka University. The simulations
results are shown in ﬁgures 1-5, where the space unit is
the wavelength λ of the incident radiation.

In Fig. 1 we see one isolated soliton and a soliton
train behind the laser pulse. A substantial part of the
laser energy (up to 30%) is transformed into these co-
herent entities. Figures. 2 and 3 show the structure of
the isolated soliton with the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
and the electron density at two diﬀerent times with the
interval approximately half of a soliton oscillation pe-
riod. In the ﬁgures the space unit is the wavelength λ
of the incident laser pulse. The soliton consists of oscil-
lating electrostatic and electromagnetic ﬁelds conﬁned in
a prolate cavity of the electron density. The cavity size
is approximately 2λ × 2λ × 3λ. The cavity is generated
by the ponderomotive force and the resulting charge sep-
aration induces a dipole electrostatic ﬁeld. As seen in
Fig. 2, the charge density in the soliton oscillates up and
down in the z-direction: at ωt/2π = 39.3 the electron
hole is in the upper part of the ﬁgure and the elctron
hump is in the lower, and vice versa – at ωt/2π = 40.2.
The electric ﬁeld at the soliton center is perpendicular
to the direction of the laser propagation, so this mode
diﬀers from the laser-driven plasma wake. This ﬁeld is
so large that the quivering distance of electrons in the
z-direction is of the order of the cavity size. This in
turn results in continuous oscillations of the cavity. The
soliton resembles an oscillating electric dipole. The oscil-
lating toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, shown in Fig. 3, indicates
that besides the strong electrostatic ﬁeld, the soliton also
has the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The electrostatic and elec-
tromagnetic components in the soliton are of the same
order of magnitude.

Figure. 3 shows that the electric ﬁeld in the soliton
is poloidal, while the magnetic ﬁeld is toroidal. We note
that the magnetic ﬁeld is mostly counterclockwise in the
upper part of the soliton, and clockwise in the lower part.
This structure of the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be consid-
ered as that of the lowest eigenmode of a cavity resonator
with a deformable wall, and thus we call this structure a
Transverse Magnetic (TM) soliton. Figure. 4 shows the

76×2π/ω (a); and cross-sections of electron density in the y−z
plane averaged over the space 35 ≤ x ≤ 37 at ωt/2π = 62.8

posite structure: transverse magnetic ﬁeld and azimuthal
electric ﬁeld. In contrast to electron vortices, which move
across a density gradient, solitons move along the den-
sity gradient towards the lower density. When a soliton
reaches some critical density, it radiates its energy in the
form of a low-frequency short electromagnetic burst [4].
The interaction of two 2D S-solitons leads to their merg-
ing and the resulting soliton acquires the total energy of
the two merged solitons [16]. Moreover, in an electron-
ion plasma a 2D soliton evolves into a postsoliton [6] on
an ion timescale due to the ion acceleration caused by the
time-averaged electrostatic ﬁeld inside the soliton. This
eﬀect leads to the formation of slowly expanding bubbles
in the plasma density [6]. Note that here we use the term
”soliton” for brevity, even if in principle the merging and
the expansion on the ion time violate the strict deﬁnition
of these structures as solitons.

We present the results of a three dimensional simu-
lation of laser induced sub-cycle relativistic electromag-
netic soliton. We use REMP - Relativistic Electro-
Magnetic Particle-mesh code based on the Particle-in-
Cell method. This parallel and fully vectorized code
exploits a new scheme of current assignment [17] that
reduces unphysical numerical eﬀects of the PIC method
signiﬁcantly. In the simulation the laser pulse propagates
along the x-axis. The pulse is linearly polarized in the

z-component of the normalized electric ﬁeld at the center
of the soliton. The electromagnetic ﬁeld trapped in the
oscillating cavity pulsates at the same frequency ΩS that
is smaller than the surrounding unperturbed Langmuir
frequency, ΩS ≈ 0.87ωpe. The density of the cavity walls
is 2 − 3ncr. Therefore the electromagnetic energy can not
be radiated away, and, in addition, the soliton oscillation
does not resonate with plasma waves.

In the equatorial plane the structure of the three di-
mensional soliton is similar to that of a two dimensional
S-soliton, while that in the perpendicular planes is simi-
lar to a two dimensional P -soliton. Considering the soli-
ton as a wave packet, it has only half of one cycle in
space, so we use the term “sub-cycle soliton”. The dy-
namic of the 3D soliton is clearly seen in the animations
produced from the data (420 stills with period 0.05, see
authors’ website). Although as shown in Fig. 4 the ﬁeld
amplitude inside the soliton decreases because of its en-
ergy losses due to ion acceleration and to the digging of a
hole in the ion density as discussed below, the soliton life-
time is suﬃciently long to distinguish it from the other
nonlinear modes generated by the laser pulse, such as the
pulse wakeﬁeld or vortices.

On the ion time-scale the soliton evolves into a postsoli-
ton [6]. The ponderomotive force displaces the electrons
outward and the Coulomb repulsion in the electrically
non neutral ion core pushes the ions away with a pro-
cess similar to the Coulomb explosion. The evolution
of the wave-plasma interaction discussed can also be in-
terpreted as a phenomenon similar to the wave collapse
that is however saturated because the electrons are al-
most completely evacuated by the strong wave. As the
soliton amplitude decreases, the ions acquire a radial mo-
mentum, as shown in Fig. 5. In contrast to the 2D S-
polarized soliton discussed in Ref.
[6], the explosion of
the 3D TM soliton is strongly anisotropic (the postsoli-
ton cavity is elongated in the z-direction) and the energy
spectrum of the accelerated ions has a minimum at zero.
In Fig. 5 we see also the ion implosion near the center
of the post-soliton. The ion implosion may appear in the
post-soliton regime due to the electron heating by the
trapped electromagnetic ﬁeld at the density cavity walls,
which causes the plasma ablation towards the cavity cen-
ter similarly to the ion implosion and the dense plasma
ﬁlament formation at the axis of the self-focusing channel
discussed in Ref. [18].

At the last stage of the soliton evolution we see a slowly
expanding postsoliton where the walls of the plasma cav-
ity move with velocity v ≈ 3·10−3c. We notice that in the
case of immobile ions we also see the soliton formation
but the lifetime of the soliton is signiﬁcantly longer and is
determined by energy conversion into fast electrons sim-
ilar to Landau damping. The almost isolated structures
in the soliton train, which we consider as solitons even if
they are not properly separated, tend to merge and form
a foam of bubbles with relatively high-density (≈ 3ncr)

walls.

A further proof of the electromagnetic nature of the
solitary structure discussed above is provided by the
3D PIC simulation in an inhomogeneous plasma with
the density gradient in the y-direction from ne = 0 to
0.168ncr, as shown in Fig. 6. We show that the soli-
ton can propagate as a whole due to its electromagnetic
nature, in contrast to the wake-ﬁeld that remains at the
same place due to its zero group velocity. In this case
the dimensionless amplitude of the incident laser pulse
is a = 3 and its FWHM size is 5λ × 8λ × 8λ. The size
of the plasma slab is 45λ × 43λ × 32λ, and that of the
simulation box is 90λ × 48λ × 32λ. Ions are immobile.
Initially, the laser pulse propagates along the x-axis, its
symmetry axis intersects the plasma-vacuum interface at
(x, y, z) = (5, 26, 0), where the local Lagmuir frequency
is ωpe = 0.3ω. In Fig. 6 (a), we see the wakeﬁeld and
a well-pronounced solitary structure. Frames (b) and (c)
show half a period of the soliton evolution, similarly to
Fig. 2. Frame (d) shows that the solitary wave prop-
agates towards the plasma-vacuum interface against the
plasma density gradient. Similarly to the 2D case dis-
[4, 14, 16], when the soliton approaches
cussed in Refs.
the plasma vacuum interface it radiates its trapped elec-
tromagnetic wave away. This result shows clearly the
diﬀerence between the wake ﬁeld and the soliton.

In conclusion we have demonstrated the existence of
the three dimensional sub-cycle relativistic electromag-
netic solitons in a collisionless cold plasma. The soli-
tons consist of the electromagnetic and electrostatic ﬁelds
with the structure of the oscillating electric dipole with
the poloidal electric ﬁeld and the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁned in the proplate cavity of the electron density. A
substantial part of the pulse energy is transformed into
solitons, approximately 25 − 30% of the incident laser
pulse. The core of the soliton is positively charged on
average in time and the soliton undergoes a Coulomb
explosion in an ion time-scale. This process results in
heating of the plasma ions.

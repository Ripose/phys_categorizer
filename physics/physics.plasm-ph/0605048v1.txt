Abstract. We study the inﬂuence of equation-of-state (EOS) model on the
interpretation of electrical conductivity measurements in strongly coupled plasma
of tungsten by Korobenko et al. (2002 Plasma Physics Reports 28(12) 1008–1016).
Three diﬀerent semiempirical EOS models for tungsten are used. Discrepancies in
obtained thermodynamic parameters and speciﬁc resistivity values as compared
with calculation results of Korobenko et al. are analysed.

1. Introduction

Electrical explosion of wires or foils is an eﬀective way to study thermophysical
properties of matter in a wide range of densities and temperatures [1, 2]. This is
one of a few methods, which allows one to obtain both thermodynamic properties and
kinetic coeﬃcients in the same experiment. For example, electrical resistance can be
calculated from experimental time dependencies of the heating current and voltage.
To determine speciﬁc properties it should be known also the cross-section area of
the conductor as a function of time. As geometric sizes of the sample may be not
measured in the process of expansion it is reasonable to use the results of numerical
simulation. In this case calculated properties of matter are determined, in particular,
by an equation-of-state (EOS) model. In the present work we study the inﬂuence of
the EOS model to the values of electrical conductivity of strongly coupled tungsten
plasma based on data from Korobenko et al. [3].

2. Description of experiment

The experiments on electrical conductivity measurements [3] were carried out in a
plane geometry. A tungsten foil stripe with the length lz = 10 mm, width h = 1.5 mm
and thickness 2a = 20 µm was placed between two glass plates with the thickness
a1 = 5 mm. Side slits were shielded with thin mica stripes. In the experiment under
consideration the skin layer thickness δ is signiﬁcantly larger than the foil thickness.
Cartesian coordinate system is introduced as follows: x-axis is perpendicular to the
foil plate, y-axis is directed along the smaller side of the foil, and z-axis — along the

Inﬂuence of equation of state...

2

bigger side. In 1D process the foil expands along the x-axis, the magnetic induction
B is directed along the y-axis, and the heating current I as well as the electric ﬁeld
intensity E are directed along the z-axis.

The foil was heated by the impulse of current; the time dependencies of the
current through the sample I(t) and voltage drop U (t) were registered (ﬁgure 1). Then
it was calculated the resistive part of the voltage drop UR(t), electrical resistance
R(t) = UR(t)I −1(t) and Joule heat q(t). Other values required for conductivity
calculation can be obtained by means of numerical simulation. Assuming that the
current density j is distributed uniformly over the cross-section of the foil and depends
only on time, i.e. j(t) = I(t)S−1(t), where S(t) = 2a(t)h, from the Maxwell equation
j(t) = µ−1∂B/∂x (SI system of units is used, µ is the magnetic permeability) one can
calculate B(t, x) = µI(t)xS−1(t). So it is possible to determine the x–t-dependencies
of foil parameters as a numerical solution of only a set of hydrodynamic equations
with the Ampere force jB = µI 2(t)xS−2(t) and energy input jE = U (t)I(t)V −1(t),
where V (t) = S(t)lz is the foil volume.

The results of calculation by such a technique not allowing for magnetic ﬁeld

diﬀusion were presented in work [3].

3. Modeling

Assuming that spatial perturbations of the sample form are small and electron and
ion temperatures are equal each other, the set of 1D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
equations in Lagrangian description for the foil heating can be represented as follows:

dm/dt = 0,

−1∂B2/∂x,

ρdv/dt = −∂P/∂x − (2µ)
ρdε/dt = −P ∂v/∂x + ∂(κ∂T /∂x)/∂x + j2/σ,
−1∂B/∂x)/∂x,

d(µB)/dt = ∂(σ

where m is the mass, v is the particle velocity, ρ is the density, T is the temperature,
P is the pressure, ε is the speciﬁc internal energy, σ is the electrical conductivity,
Initial conditions for the set of equations (1)–(4)
κ is the thermal conductivity.
are written as follows: ρ(x, 0) = ρ0, v(x, 0) = 0, T (x, 0) = T0, B(x, 0) = 0. The
conditions on the symmetry plane x = 0 and on the surface x = a(t) of the foil, as
well as on the outer boundary of the glass plate x = a1 are as follows: v(0, t) = 0,
v(a, t) = da/dt, v(a1, t) = 0, B(0, t) = 0, B(a, t) = µI(t)/2h, ∂T /∂x|x=0 = 0,
∂T /∂x|x=a−0 = ∂T /∂x|x=a+0, T (a1, t) = T0, ∂P/∂x|x=0 = 0, P (a− 0, t) = P (a+ 0, t),
P (a1, t) = P0. Here ρ0, T0, and P0 correspond to normal conditions.

We used three diﬀerent EOS models for tungsten [4–6]. Semiempirical multi-phase
EOS [4] in a form of functions P = P (ρ, T ) and ε = ε(ρ, T ) (EOS1) takes into account
the eﬀects of high-temperature melting, evaporation, and ionization. This EOS agrees
with the collection of experimental data on static and shock compression as well as on
adiabatic and isobaric expansion of the metal, see details in [4]. Caloric EOS [5] in a
functional form P = P (ρ, ε) (EOS2) neglects phase transitions; however it describes
available shock-wave experiments within a good accuracy. The soft-sphere EOS [6]
as functions P = P (ρ, T ) and ε = ε(ρ, T ) with coeﬃcients from [7] (EOS3) considers
evaporation of metal and has been calibrated using isobaric expansion experiments

but does not take into account melting and gives understated density at normal
temperature and pressure.

As EOS1 allows for more eﬀects and agrees with wider collection of data including
the region of parameters of the considered experiment [3] this model is assumed to
be more reliable than EOS2 and EOS3. However that may be, the correct EOS
can be chosen (not necessarily amongst three used models) only in the case of direct
thermodynamic measurements in the range of interest.

To describe the properties of glass we used caloric EOS P = P (ρ, ε) [8].
The conductivity of tungsten was determined by the relation

σ = I(t)lzU

−1(t)S

−1(t)

using the experimental dependencies I(t) and U (t) [3] except for the stage of heating up
to T = 10 kK. In case of EOS1 at low temperatures we used the semiempirical formulas
[9–11] for the electrical conductivity σ = σ(ρ, T ) taking into account melting eﬀect
instead of experimental functions because of noise on the measured time dependence of
voltage at the initial stage. The thermal conductivity in case of EOS1 was calculated
according to the Wiedemann–Franz law, κ = kW F T σ, where kW F is the Wiedemann–
Franz constant. In cases of EOS2 and EOS3 during the initial stage we used time
dependence of voltage U (t) obtained in numerical modeling with EOS1. Thus in these
cases the electrical conductivity was determined according to (5) during the whole
heating process. The thermal conductivity eﬀects in cases of EOS2 and EOS3 were
neglected.

4. Results

We carried out a number of simulations of the experiment using 1D MHD model
as described in the previous section.
In ﬁgure 2 shown are time dependencies of
the speciﬁc internal energy ε(t) resulting from numerical modeling with three above-
mentioned EOS. One can see that all three curves ε(t) are very close during the initial
heating stage.

The calculated pressure at the symmetry plane and at the foil surface depending
on the speciﬁc internal energy at the same layers is shown in ﬁgure 3 in comparison
with results from simulations of Korobenko et al. [3]. It can be seen that the melting
process leads to oscillations of pressure P (ε) near the symmetry plane of the foil (see
curve at x = 0 for EOS1 in ﬁgure 3). If melting is neglected (like in calculations with
EOS2 and EOS3 models) the pressure dependencies P (ε) are smooth. The dynamics
of the process is to some extent determined by the EOS model: after the melting
EOS1 gives the fastest pressure rise during expansion, EOS2 — the slowest one. At
the later stage of the heating EOS1 and EOS2 result in close pressure values while
EOS3 shows 15% lower pressures.

The EOS model used in work [3] for the interpretation of experimental data is
based upon the soft-sphere EOS [6] and takes into account ionization eﬀects according
to the mean atom model [12]. This EOS is unpublished and this fact complicates the
qualitative analysis of distinctions. Nevertheless, ﬁgure 3 shows that the calculated
pressure [3] in the process of foil heating is always lower than in present work; the
same situation is observed for temperature. The simulation with EOS3 gives the
closest result to that of the work [3]; this coincidence can be explained by similar EOS
models used in these calculations.

One can see in ﬁgure 3 that parameters in the foil are distributed homogeneously
except for the moment of melting which is clearly distinguishable by pressure
oscillations. After melting thermodynamic states of the foil though sometimes very
close to the binodal are always in liquid or supercritical plasma state (ﬁgure 4).
However, inhomogeneity in temperature distribution appears at the late stage of the
expansion process. For example acording to modeling with EOS1 the scale of this
inhomogeneity can be distinctly seen in ﬁgure 4 where the thermodynamic tracks of
diﬀerent layers of the foil are shown. Distinctions in the methodology of simulation
and description of thermodynamic properties of tungsten lead to systematically higher
values of electrical resistivity in our interpretation (maximum excess is about 60% for
simulation with EOS1) than after Korobenko et al. [3] (ﬁgure 5).

It is worth to mention that during the heating process the measured voltage
begins to drop at time t ∼ 750 ns and soon (at t ∼ 850 ns) current begins to rise (see
ﬁgure 1). This eﬀect in work [3] is connected with the beginning of transition into
“dielectric” (plasma) state. Actually there is a drop in resistance at the later stage
of the experiment [3], however there is no noticeable change in speciﬁc resistance (see
ﬁgure 5, ε > 10 kJ/g). From ﬁgure 4 it can be seen that supercritical (plasma)
state of tungsten, ρ ≤ ρcr, is reached at temperature T ∼ 20 kK, which corresponds
to time t ∼ 0.6 µs and speciﬁc internal energy ε ∼ 5 kJ/g.
It is known that the
character of electrical conductivity changes from metal-like to plasma-like near the
critical density [13], ρcr = 4.854 g/cm3 for tungsten according to EOS1, so one can
expect that the resistivity dependence should change its behavior at values of internal
energy ε ∼ 5 kJ/g. As this is not the case in ﬁgure 5 we oﬀer an alternative explanation
of the “saturation” of electrical conductivity. Namely we assume that a breakdown
of interelectrode gap takes place along the glass surface at t ∼ 750 ns (the density
and speciﬁc internal energy of tungsten foil at this moment are ρ ∼ 2 g/cm3 and
ε ∼ 8 kJ/g).

We tried to reproduce the experimental time dependence of voltage using time
dependence of current as input data together with wide-range conductivity models for
tungsten [13, 14] and EOS1 model. The results of simulation with the conductivity
model [13] are shown in ﬁgure 1. We could well describe the voltage data up to
t ∼ 500 ns and satisfactory up to t ∼ 750 ns, but when the voltage began to drop
in the experiment it continued to rise in our calculations. It is possible to reproduce
the maximum around t ∼ 750 ns on the experimental voltage dependence only by
use of a breakdown model in the simulation. Assuming that the breakdown occurs
on the boundary between the glass plate and tungsten foil we increased the electrical
conductivity value in region 0.95 ≤ x/a(t) ≤ 1 by an order of magnitude linearly
during time interval from t = 750 to 900 ns. It can be easily seen in ﬁgure 1 that
in this case we have much better agreement with experimental time dependence of
voltage. Simulations with electrical conductivity model [14] showed much more worse
results than that with the model [13] and are not displayed in ﬁgure 1.

Thus either a breakdown occurs during the expansion of the foil or one can
formulate an electrical conductivity model, which will be able to reproduce the voltage
maximum. To solve this dilemma is an aim of a future work.

5. Conclusions

In this work we have analyzed the experiment on electrical conductivity measurements
of strongly coupled tungsten plasma under heating by the current pulse. We have used

Inﬂuence of equation of state...

1D MHD simulation and diﬀerent EOS models to study distribution of parameters in
the foil. We have also tried to reproduce experimental voltage time dependence using
two electrical conductivity models.

We can conclude that pressure, density and temperature are distributed almost
homogeneously across the foil except for the melting stage of the process. The
dynamics of the heating and expansion is determined by the EOS model giving rise
to distinctions in electrical resistivity values up to 60%.

Moreover, the last stage of the experiment is probably inﬂuenced by the shunting
breakdown of the interelectrode gap. These facts indicate that even in the case of
the foil heating regime [3], where certain eﬀorts have been taken for achievement
of homogeneous distribution of thermophysical parameters to simplify interpretation,
there are still open problems to treat experimental data. We believe that further
investigations of thermodynamic and transport properties of tungsten plasma will
be helpful for the creation of adequate wide-range EOS and electrical conductivity
models.

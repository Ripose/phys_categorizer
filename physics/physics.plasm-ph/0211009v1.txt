Abstract
For low-pressure discharges, when the electron mean free path is larger or comparable with
the discharge length, the electron dynamics is essentially nonlocal. Moreover, the electron energy
distribution function (EEDF) deviates considerably from a Maxwellian. Therefore, an accurate
kinetic description of the low-pressure discharges requires knowledge of the nonlocal conductiv-
ity operator and calculation of the nonMaxwellian EEDF. The previous treatments made use of
simplifying assumptions: a uniform density proﬁle and a Maxwellian EEDF. In the present study
a self-consistent system of equations for the kinetic description of nonlocal, nonuniform, nearly
collisionless plasmas of low-pressure discharges is derived. It consists of the nonlocal conductiv-
ity operator and the averaged kinetic equation for calculation of the nonMaxwellian EEDF. The
importance of accounting for the nonuniform plasma density proﬁle on both the current density
proﬁle and the EEDF is demonstrated.

INTRODUCTION

Low pressure radio-frequency discharges are extensively utilized for plasma processing
and lighting [1]. Simulation of discharge properties is a common tool for optimization of
the plasma density proﬁles and ion and electron ﬂuxes. Recent plasma technology tends to
decrease the gas pressures down to the millitorr range. For these low pressures it is eas-
ier to maintain uniform plasmas with well controlled parameters. Due to the large value
of the electron mean free path (λ) the electron current is determined not by the local rf
electric ﬁeld (Ohm’s law), but rather is a function of the whole proﬁle of the rf electric
ﬁeld on distances of order λ (anomalous skin eﬀect). Therefore, a rather complicated non-
local conductivity operator has to be determined for the calculation of the rf electric ﬁeld
penetration into the plasma. Moreover, the electron energy distribution function (EEDF)
is typically nonMaxwellian in these discharges [2]. Hence, for accurate calculation of the

2

discharge characteristics at low pressures, the EEDF needs to be computed self-consistently.
Self-consistency is an important and diﬃcult issue for the kinetic simulations of a plasma.
The EEDF, nonlocal conductivity and plasma density proﬁles are all nonlinear and nonlo-
cally coupled. That is why, the self-consistency aspect of the model is the main concern
of this study. The so-called ”nonlocal” approach relies on the direct semi-analytic solution
of the Boltzmann equation in the limiting regime where the electron relaxation length is
much large than the discharge gap, but the electron mean free path is small compared with
the discharge dimension [3], [4]. The nonlocal approach has been successfully applied to
the self-consistent kinetic modelling of various low-pressure discharges, where the electron
mean free path is small: the capacitively coupled plasmas [5]; [6], the inductively coupled
plasmas [7], [8], [9], [10]; the dc discharges [11], [12]; the afterglow [13], and the surface-wave
discharges [14]. The additional references can be found in reviews: [15], [16], and [17].

If gas pressure lowered even farther, the electron mean free path becomes comparable or
even larger than the discharge dimension and numerous collisionless phenomena dominate
the discharge characteristics [18]. In the present paper the nonlocal approach is general-
ized for the low-pressure discharges to account for the collisionless heating and transit-time
(electron inertia) eﬀects in the discharge description.

Present analysis considers only an inductively coupled plasma. But the approach has
been designed in the most generalized way, so that derivations can be readily performed for
other discharges. For example, in Ref.[19] the capacitive discharge; in Ref. [20] the electron-
cyclotron-resonance discharge and in Ref.[21] surface-wave discharge were considered with
self-consistent account for collisionless heating.

Most previously reported theoretical studies assume a uniform plasma, in a semi-inﬁnite
[22] or a slab geometry [23]. In this case the analytical treatment considerably simpliﬁes,
because electron trajectories are straight. In the semi-inﬁnite case, electrons traverse the
region of the rf electric ﬁeld (skin layer) and are reﬂected back into the plasma at the dis-
charge walls. An acquired velocity kick then dissipates in the plasma on distances of order
the electron mean free path. If the plasma dimension is small or comparable with λ, the
subsequent kicks are correlated. The resonance between the wave frequency and the bounce
frequency of the electron motion between walls may result in modiﬁcation of the nonlocal
conductivity [24], [25] and may yield an enhanced electron heating [26]. The anomalous skin
eﬀect has been studied experimentally in cylindrical [24] and planar discharges [27]. Addi-
tional references can be found in the reviews of classical and recent works on the anomalous
skin eﬀect in gas discharge plasmas [28], [29]. The theoretical studies in cylindrical geometry
are much more cumbersome, and has been done for uniform plasma in Refs. [30], [31], [32]
and for a parabolic potential well in Ref.[33]. Qualitative results in the cylindrical geom-
etry are similar to the results in the plane geometry, therefore, in the present study only
one-dimensional slab geometry is considered.

For the case of a bounded uniform plasma, the electrostatic potential well is ﬂat in the
plasma and inﬁnite at the wall (to simulate the existence of sheaths). In this square potential
well, electrons are reﬂected back into the plasma only at the discharge walls. In a realistic
non-uniform plasma, however, the position of the turning points will depend on the electron
total (kinetic plus potential) energy and the actual shape of the potential well, i.e., low total
energy electrons bounce back at locations within the plasma and may not reach regions of
high electric ﬁeld at all. As a result the current density proﬁles in a nonuniform plasma
may considerably diﬀer from the proﬁles in a uniform plasma. The theory of the anomalous
skin eﬀect for an arbitrary proﬁle of the electrostatic potential and a Maxwellian EVDF was

3

developed by Meierovich et al. in Refs.[34], [35], and [36] for the slab geometry. Although
rigorous analytical results of non-uniform plasmas have been reported, the detailed self-
consistent simulations related to such plasmas and comparison with experimental data are
lacking. Such simulations were completed recently and presented in our separate publications
[37] and [38] and will be additionally reported elsewhere.

·

The kinetic description of the anomalous skin eﬀect is based on a well known mechanism
of collisionless power dissipation -the Landau damping [39].
In the inﬁnite plasma, the
resonance particles moving with a velocity (v) close to the wave phase velocity, so that
ω = v
k, intensively interact with wave ﬁelds. Therefore, the collisionless electron heating
(and the real part of the surface impedance) depends on the magnitude of a Fourier harmonic
of the electric ﬁeld [E(k)] and the number of the resonant particles [f (vx = ω/k), x = k/k].
That is why, the momentum acquired in the skin layer of width δ is maximal if the projection
of velocity perpendicular to the plasma boundary (x - axis direction) is of order ω/δ. If the
interaction with the skin layer are repeated in a resonance manner the momentum changes
are mounted up. Therefore, the main contribution to the electron heating and the resistive
part of the surface impedance comes from these resonant electrons. In a bounded plasma,
the resonance condition requires the bounce period (Tb) be equal to one or several rf electric
ﬁeld periods: Tb = 2πn/ω, where n is an integer number. The maximum interaction occurs
for n = 1 (see below). For a slab of width L, Tb = 2L/vx. The maximum electron heating
occurs if both aforementioned conditions are satisﬁed simultaneously, which gives ω/δ = vx
and 2L/vx = 2π/ω or L = δπ [25]. Hence, the optimum conditions for the power transfer to
the plasma corresponds to the plasma of size comparable with the 3 times of the skin depth.
Because the bounce frequency depends on the electrostatic potential, accounting for the
plasma nonuniformity is important for a correct calculation of the eﬃcient power coupling.
As discussed before, the collisionless heating is determined by the number of resonant
particles, and, hence, is dependent on the EEDF. The EEDF, in its turn, is controlled by the
collisionless heating. The only particles, which are in resonance with a wave, are heated by
the collisionless heating. It means that in the regime of the collisionless dissipation, the form
of the electron energy distribution function is sensitive to the wave spectrum. Therefore, the
plateau in the EEDF can be formed in the regions of intensive collisionless heating, if the
wave phase velocities are conﬁned in some interval [40]. The evidences of a plateau formation
for the capacitive discharge plasma were obtained in Ref. [41]. The cold electrons, which are
trapped in the discharge center, do not reach periphery plasma regions where an intensive
rf elective ﬁeld is located, and as a result, these electrons are not heated by the rf electric
ﬁeld. The coupling between the EEDF shape and collisionless heating may result in new
nonlinear phenomena: an explosive generation of the cold electrons [42]. The experimental
evidences of the collisionless heating on the EEDF were obtained in Ref. [27], [43], [44]and
[45].

In the linear approximation the collisionless dissipation does not depend explicitly on the
collision frequency. However, as shown in Ref. [46], if the electron elastic collision frequency
is too small, heating can actually decrease due to nonlinear eﬀects akin of the nonlinear
Landau damping.

The present article presents a self-consistent system of equations describing the non-local
electron kinetics in a 1-D slab (bounded) non-uniform plasma. The system consists of a
nonlocal conductivity operator, and an averaged over fast electron motions kinetic equation
for the EEDF. Transit time (non-local) eﬀects on the current density proﬁle and collision-
less heating are of particular interest. Rigorous derivations for the nonlocal conductivity

4

operator have been performed. The analytic results of Ref.[34] for the Maxwellian EEDF
were generalized for the nonMaxwellian EEDF. The spectral method was developed to ﬁnd
the rf electric ﬁeld proﬁle. A quasilinear approach was used for calculating the collisionless
heating. The quasilinear theory developed in Ref.[47] was generalized for an arbitrary value
of the collision frequency. As a result, the simulations can be done in a wide range of the
background gas pressures ranging from the collisional case (λ << δ) to the fully collisionless
case (λ > L). Self-consistency of the nonlocal conductivity operator and the energy diﬀusion
coeﬃcient has been veriﬁed: both yield the same expression for the power deposition. The
robust time-averaging procedure was designed for the kinetic equation in a most general
way. As a result, the procedure can be readily repeated for other discharges, see for example
[19] and [20].

II. CALCULATION OF ANISOTROPIC PART OF THE ELECTRON VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION f1

−

In low-pressure discharges, where the energy relaxation length is large compared with the
plasma width, the main of the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF) is a function
of the total energy only [15], [16] and [17]. Therefore, we look for f = f0 + f1, where f0(ε)
is a function of the total energy ε, ε = w + ϕ(x), w = m(v2
z )/2 is the kinetic
energy, ϕ =
eφ is the electron electrostatic potential energy, and φ is the electrostatic
potential. f1 does not contribute to the electron density (the integral f1 over the velocity
f1d3v = 0), but f1 contributes to the electron current (the integral
space is equal to zero
f0vd3v = 0).
f0 over the velocity space weighted with the electron velocity is equal to zero
Typically the mean electron ﬂow velocity (V rf =
f0d3v) is small compared with

x/2 + ϕ(x). There have been a number of studies, which
explored the eﬀects of the exact collision integral on collisionless phenomena [51], [52]. These
treatments use expansion in series of spherical functions in velocity spaces. The exact
calculation are important only if the collision frequency is a strong function of the polloidal
scattering angle. If the diﬀerential cross section does not depend on the polloidal scattering
angle, the BGK approximation is correct exactly [52]. For partially ionized plasma electron-
neutral collisions are the most frequent scattering mechanism. At typical electron energies
in the low-pressure discharges 1-5 eV [2], the diﬀerential cross section weakly depends on
the polloidal scattering angle, and, therefore, the BGK approximation has a good accuracy.
Equation (2.5) can be solved by a number of diﬀerent methods. First, let us consider
a direct solution. Alternative derivation using Fourier series is performed in Appendix C.

time consuming [37]. The better approach is to solve the integro-diﬀerential Eq.(4.1) making
use of a spectral method. In 1D geometry the electric ﬁeld can be represented as a sum of
harmonic functions. The method is described in the Appendix D.

If the electron mean free path is large compared with gap (λ >> L), the ﬁrst two terms on
the left hand side are dominant. Therefore, f0 is approximately a function of the εx only, not
a function of both variables x, vx separately. Similarly, Stv
el(f ) is the largest term from the
remaining terms in the equation. Therefore, f0 is approximately isotropic, and is a function
of ε only, so that St(f0) = 0 [50]. This assumption was veriﬁed by comparison with particle-
in-cell simulations in Ref.[5] for a capacitive coupled plasma, in Ref.[8], [32] for a inductive
coupled plasma, and in Ref.[20] for a ECR discharge and in Ref.[53] experimentally.

To ﬁnd f0, it is necessary to average over fast electron bouncing and over all velocity
angles. First, let us average over fast electron bouncing. In order to do so, we integrate all
terms of Eq.(5.1) over the full period of electron bouncing

Thus, averaging of the terms, which are functions of the position and the kinetic energy

for the local (collisional) case [17].

in the skin layer is collisionless, but the randomization of the velocity kick acquired during
a single pass through the skin layer occurs due to collisions in the plasma bulk, and in the
opposite limit of the large mean free path (λ > L) Eq.(5.19) describes collisionless heating
(see Appendix B,C for details). If the collision frequency does not depend on the kinetic

D. Solving the Maxwell equations for the rf electric ﬁeld using Fourier Series

System that has an antenna at x = 0 and a grounded electrode at x = L in the uniform
plasma were studied in Ref.[25]. The papers [23] and [31] considered a cylindrical-like system
in the uniform plasma. Both papers used Fourier series to solve Maxwell’s equations. Here,
we shall generalize the procedure for a case of a nonuniform plasma.

Similarly to the previous analysis, it is convenient to continue the rf electric ﬁeld sym-

Coeﬃcients Gl,n(ε) can be eﬀectively computed using the fast Fourier transform [55].
The oﬀ-diagonal coeﬃcients are generally very small, that is why using this spectral method
makes computing much faster than the straight forward ﬁnite diﬀerence method used in
Ref.[37].

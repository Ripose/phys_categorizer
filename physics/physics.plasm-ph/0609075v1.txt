Kinetic theory for radiation interacting with sound waves in

ultrarelativistic pair plasmas

A kinetic theory for radiation interacting with sound waves in an ultrarelativistic

electron–positron plasma is developed. It is shown that the eﬀect of a spatial spectral

broadening of the electromagnetic pulse is to introduce a reduction of the growth

rates for the decay and modulational instabilities. Such spectral broadening could

be due to a ﬁnite pulse coherence length, or through the use of random phase ﬁlters,

and would stabilize the propagation of electromagnetic pulses.

The physics of electron–positron plasmas is important for understanding the pulsar en-

vironments [1, 2] and laboratory plasmas irradiated by intense lasers [3, 4], where quantum

ﬁeld eﬀects come into play [5]. Pair plasmas are also believed to be important in the early

universe, in supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei, and in gamma-ray bursts [6, 7].

A pair plasma can be created in these environments by collisions between strongly accel-

erated particles [8]. There is also a possibility of pair creation via high-energy curvature

radiation photons in the vicinity of strongly magnetized astrophysical objects, triggered by

charged particles streaming along the curved magnetic ﬁeld [9]. This results in large quan-

tities of positrons produced close to pulsar polar caps [10, 11]. In laboratory environments,
laser experiments with focal spot intensities exceeding 1020 W/cm2 have demonstrated the

production of MeV electrons and evidence of positrons via laser multiphoton–gamma photon

interactions [12, 13] as well as via electron collisions [14, 15].

When the intensity of the radiation is increased, the pair plasma particles attain rela-

tivistic quiver velocities, and the plasma dynamics turns out to be essentially nonlinear, see

e.g. Refs. [16, 17, 18, 19]. New decay instabilities, which are due to relativistic eﬀects, can

thus appear [20]. The nonlinear propagation of radiation in electron–positron plasmas has

therefore been suggested to be the reason behind the high eﬀective temperatures of pulsar

radio emissions [21] as well as a possible source of the large frequency shifts in such emissions

In the present paper, we will study the eﬀects of partial coherence on the nonlinear

radiation propagation in pair plasmas. It is shown that a spatial spectral broadening of the

electromagnetic pulse can lead to a reduced growth rate for the decay and modulational

instabilities. This type of pulse broadening could be due to a ﬁnite pulse coherence length

(as in ultra-short laser pulse application), or through the use of random phase ﬁlters. The

eﬀect of the broadening is to stabilize the propagation of electromagnetic pulses in pair

The interaction between electromagnetic radiation and sound waves in pair plasmas with

where A is the vector potential of the radiation, ωp = (πn0e2c2/T )1/2 is the eﬀective plasma

n0 is the unperturbed plasma density, n1 (≪ n0) is the density perturbation, c is the speed

is the sound speed in a relativistically hot pair plasma, σ = 4π2/45¯h3c3, and ¯h is the Planck

constant divided by 2π. A similar system has been previously derived for a cold plasma [24],

and recently for a warm dust-laden plasma [25].

A kinetic description of the radiation propagation may be obtained by the introduction

of the Wigner density matrix (see e.g. [26, 27, 28, 29]

ρij(r, t, k, ω) =

dτ dζ exp(ik·ζ −iωτ )hA∗

where the angular brackets denote the ensemble average [30]. The Wigner density matrix

generalizes the the classical distribution function, and satisﬁes

I ≡ h|A|2i =

dω dk ρ

Z

where ρ = Tr(ρij) is the trace of the state density matrix. We note that for a monochromatic
pump wave A = A0 exp(ik0 · r − iω0t) + c.c., we have I = 2|A0|2. As there is no polarization

mixing and the ponderomotive force term only depends on I, it will here suﬃce to use ρ as

our radiation ﬁeld description. Applying the time derivative to the deﬁnition (3), using Eq.

(1), and taking the trace of the resulting equation we obtain

with a constant phase factor and therefore does not appear in Eq. (5). The equations (2),

(4), and (5) form a closed system describing the nonlinear interaction of sound waves and

partially coherent radiation in pair plasmas with ultrarelativistic temperatures.

Next, we analyze the modulational instability [31, 32] of the coupled system of equations

(2), (4), and (5), by letting n1 = ˜n1 exp(iK · r − iΩt) and ρ = ρ0(k, ω) + ˜ρ exp(iK ·

r − iΩt), where |˜ρ1| ≪ ρ0 and K and Ω are the perturbation wave vector and frequency,

respectively. We then linearize with respect to the perturbations to obtain the nonlinear

dispersion relation

D− ≈ 0.

Next, we consider the case of partial coherence. We will here restrict our consideration

to the one-dimensional case. Assuming that the background electromagnetic wave has a

random phase ϕ(z) such that hexp[−iϕ(z + ζ/2)] exp[iϕ(z − ζ/2)]i = exp(−∆|ζ|), the quasi-

particle distribution takes the Breit–Wigner form [28, 33]

We next normalize to dimensionless variables according to ω0 → ω0/ωp, Ω → Ω/ωp,
K → Kc/ωp, ∆ → ∆c/ωp, u → u/c, vg → vg/c, and I0 → I0e2/24T 2. In the case of the

decay instability, we neglect the self-modulation of the electromagnetic wave, and we also

have D− ≈ 0. Neglecting the Ω2 term in D−, we have plotted the growth rate Γ of the

decay instability in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2 we have plotted the growth rate for the modulational

instability. In both Figs. 1 and 2 the damping eﬀect of the spatial spectral broadening can

be seen. We have chosen the normalized parameter values ω0 = 1, I0 = 0.1, vg = 0.1, and

u = 0.2 in both Figs. 1 and 2.

We also plot the case of an over-dense pair plasma, such that ω0 = 0.2 in Fig. 3. The

other parameters remain the same as above.

In Fig. 4 we display the modulational instability growth rate for an under-dense pair

plasma, such that ω0 = 2. The remaining parameters remain the same as above.

To summarize, we have consider the nonlinear propagation of spatial broadband elec-

tromagnetic waves in a relativistically hot electron-positron plasma. For this purpose, we

have introduced the Wigner transformation on a pair of equations comprising the nonlinear

Schr¨odinger equation and a radiation pressure driven sound equation. As a result, we obtain

a wave kinetic equation that is appropriate to derive a nonlinear dispersion relation. The

latter exhibits that the growth rates of the decay and modulational instabilities are reduced

when electromagnetic waves a broad spatial bandwidth. Hence, the electromagnetic waves

should be useful in understanding the nonlinear propagation of partially coherent electro-

magnetic waves in the early universe as well as in forthcoming laser-plasma interaction

experiments.

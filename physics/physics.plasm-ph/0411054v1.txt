Photon–photon scattering in vacuum due to the interaction with virtual electron-positron pairs is
a consequence of quantum electrodynamics. A way for detecting this phenomenon has been devised
based on interacting modes generated in microwave waveguides or cavities [G. Brodin, M. Marklund
and L. Stenﬂo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87 171801 (2001)]. Here we materialize these ideas, suggest a
concrete cavity geometry, make quantitative estimates and propose experimental details. It is found
that detection of photon-photon scattering can be within the reach of present day technology.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Classically, photon–photon scattering does not take
place in vacuum. However, according to quantum elec-
trodynamics (QED), such a process may occur owing to
the interaction with virtual electron–positron pairs. An
eﬀective ﬁeld theory containing only the electromagnetic
ﬁelds can be formulated in terms of the Heisenberg–Euler
Lagrangian [1, 2], which is valid for ﬁeld strengths below
the QED critical ﬁeld 1018 V m−1 and for wavelengths
shorter than the Compton wavelength 10−12 m [3, 4, 5].
Several suggestions to detect photon-photon scattering
in laboratories have been made [6, 7, 8], and the recent
increase in available laser intensities has stimulated var-
ious schemes [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
[15] we
suggested an alternative method, using the signiﬁcantly
weaker (but still strong) ﬁelds that can be conﬁned in
a microwave cavity. The main advantage of adopting a
cavity is that we can achieve a resonant interaction be-
tween the eigenmodes in a large volume, leading to an
excited signal at a new eigenfrequency.

In Ref.

In the present paper we materialize the proposal made
in Ref. [15] in several ways. Various concrete geometries
fulﬁlling all resonance and frequency matching conditions
in a cavity are devised, and the coupling between the
pump modes and the excited mode is evaluated for a rect-
angular prism and a cylindrical geometry. The amplitude
of the excited mode is then determined in terms of the
quality factor of the cavity and the ﬁeld strengths of the
pump modes. Comparing with the performance reached
in existing superconducting niobium cavities, it turns out
that the cavity key parameters, namely the quality fac-
tor and the allowed ﬁeld strength (before ﬁeld emission
and/or superconductivity break down) can reach values
which allow for several photons in the excited mode. To
be able to detect the very weak excited signal in the pres-
ence of the pump waves, we propose a ”cavity ﬁltering
geometry”. Finite element calculations are made in or-

der to demonstrate a geometry that fulﬁlls the relevant
resonance and frequency matching conditions. The esti-
mated signal in the ﬁltered region corresponds to roughly
30 microwave photons/m3. The results of Refs. [16] and
[17], where eﬀects of single microwave photons conﬁned in
cavities are measured using sensitive techniques involving
transitions of Rydberg atoms, suggest that detection of
the estimated signal is possible. Hence we suggest that
elastic photon-photon scattering can be observed with
present day technology.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF
CALCULATION

virtual electron positron pairs can be described by the

terms in (1) represent the eﬀects of vacuum polarization
and magnetization. The QED corrected Maxwell’s vac-
uum equations can then be written in their classical form
using D = ε0E + P and H = B/µ0
M where P and M
are of third order in the ﬁeld amplitudes E and B, and
µ0 = 1/c2ε0. Expressions for P and M can be found in,
for example, Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15].
There are several reasons for considering wave interac-

−

tions in cavities:

1. We can beneﬁt from coherent resonant interactions.
In contrast, the nonlinear coupling vanishes for par-
allell plane waves in an unbounded medium. How-
ever, we note that the presence of an inhomoge-
neous background magnetic ﬁeld can also be re-
sponsible for a nonzero eﬀect, see Ref. [14] .

2. The growth of the new mode will not be saturated

by convection out of the interaction region.

3. The techniques for detecting small signals in such
cavities are very well developed, see e.g. Refs [16,
17].

Calculations of the coupling strength between various
eigenmodes can be made including the nonlinear polar-
ization and magnetization, see e.g. Ref. [15]. However, a
more convenient approach, which gives the same result,
starts directly with the Lagrangian density (1).

Our general procedure for ﬁnding the cavity eigen-
mode coupling and the saturated amplitude of the ex-
cited mode, to be applied in sections III and IV, can be
summarized as follows:

1. We determine the linear eigenmodes of the cavity
using the standard Maxwell vacuum equations together
with the boundary conditions for inﬁnitely conducting
walls, and express all ﬁeld components in terms of the
vector potential amplitude.

2. Next we choose resonant eigenmodes fulﬁlling fre-
quency matching conditions. For two interacting initial
pump modes (indices 1 and 2) with distinct frequencies
ω1 and ω2, the possible frequency matching choices, cor-
ω2) and
responding to a cubic nonlinearity, are
2ω2). For deﬁniteness we concentrate on the

in all examples. Since the eigenfrequencies are deter-
mined by the geometry, we note that the condition (2)
gives a design requirement involving the dimensions of
the cavity. In this context it can be noted that there are
several reasons for using two pump waves rather than
one, that in principle could excite a mode with three
times the frequency of the pump mode. Firstly, for two
pump modes there are generally better possibilities to
vary the parameters in the set-up in order to optimize
the output of the excited mode. Secondly, for a cylin-
drical geometry and a single pump mode, the design re-
quirements following from the frequency matching results
in eigenmodes that have a too weak nonlinear coupling.
Finally, there is a general tendency to get stronger non-
linear coupling when the pump modes and the excited
mode have rather close frequencies.

3. We then perform a variation of the amplitude of the
L d3rdt = 0 in order to obtain the
eigenmodes and let δ
mode-coupling equations directly from the Lagrangian
density (1). The evolution equation for each eigenmode
is obtained by expressing the Lagrangian in terms of the
potential and varying the corresponding vector potential
amplitude. The lowest order linear terms then vanish,
since the dispersion relation of each mode is fulﬁlled. For
the terms that are quadratic in the ﬁelds we must thus
take into account that the amplitude has a weak time
dependence when making the amplitude variation. How-
ever, for the QED correction terms in the Lagrangian the
time dependence of the amplitudes can be neglected.

4. In the absence of dissipation, the equations now ob-
tained imply steady growth of mode 3, until the energy

2

of that mode is comparable to that of the pump modes.
However, when some damping mechanism is present (e.g.
due to a ﬁnite conductivity of the cavity walls) the ampli-
tude saturates at a level where the mode-coupling growth
balances the dissipation of the excited mode. This ef-
fect can be easily included by adding a phenomenologi-
cal damping term in the evolution equation, whose value
is estimated by comparing with quality factors currently
reached in superconducting niobium cavities.

respectively, which must be fulﬁlled in order for the cou-

coupling coeﬃcient for speciﬁc mode numbers and ge-
ometries consistent with the frequency matching condi-
tions. As described in the previous section, we could
then determine the saturated amplitude from a balance
between mode-coupling growth and dissipation, where
the latter eﬀect can be introduced by simply adding a
phenomenological damping term. However, it turns out
that a cylindrical geometry gives a slightly better perfor-
mance, and thus we will instead work out that case in
more detail.

IV. CYLINDRICAL GEOMETRY

We consider the case where all eigenmodes are TE-
modes with no angular dependence, with ﬁelds that can
be derived from the vector potential

where a is the cylinder radius, z0 the length of the cavity,
J1 the ﬁrst order Bessel function and β one of its zeros.
The cylinder occupies the region 0
z0 centered
around the z-axis. We have here introduced cylindrical
ϕ in the
coordinates ρ and z as well as the unit vector
azimuthal direction. The corresponding ﬁelds are

modes cannot have the same order of their respective β,
for resonant interaction to occur, and thus we introduce

When calculating (15) we have assumed the mode num-
ber matching n3 = 2n1 + n2. Equation (14) implies a
linear growth of mode 3, until the backreaction of the
pump modes becomes signiﬁcant. In reality dissipative
mechanisms (e.g. a ﬁnite conductivity of the cavity walls)
will put a limit on the excited amplitude. This can
be described in a phenomenological way by substituting
d/dt
(ω3/2πQ), where Q is the cavity quality
factor. The steady state amplitude is thus

Before evaluating (18) we need to specify the mode
numbers and the geometry. As an example we let
(n1, n2, n3) = (3, 15, 21) (fulﬁlling n3 = 2n1 + n2)and
take β2 = β3 = 3.83, corresponding to the ﬁrst zero of
J1, and β1 = 7.01 corresponding to the second zero. This
gives us z0/a = 9.53 through the frequency matching
condition (2) and determines the frequency relations to
ω3/ω2 = 1.26 and ω3/ω1 = 1.12. Substituting these val-
ues and numerically evaluating the integrals (16a)–(16e)
then gives Kcyl = 3.39. The key parameters are the qual-
ity factor and the pump ﬁeld strength. An advantage
with our choice of eigenmodes is that the pump electric
ﬁeld is zero at the cavity surface, which means that we do
not have to worry about ﬁeld emission [19]. Instead the

4

≈

×

×

pump amplitude is limited by the surface magnetic ﬁeld,
which needs to be below the critical value for which the
walls cease to be superconducting. From the experimen-
tal results presented in Ref. [20], we ﬁnd that the critical
magnetic ﬁeld for a high pure niobium material can reach
0.28 Tesla, at a temperature of the order of or below
B
109
1 K. If we specify z0 = 2.50 m, we get ω1 = 8.10
109 rad/s, implying that ﬁeld levels
rad/s and ω2 = 7.15
close to the magnetic surface ﬁeld condition correspond
to A1 = 0.017 Vs/m, and A2
0.024 Vs/m. The con-
ductivity of niobium allow for quality factors Q > 1011
for temperatures in the range of interest below 1 K. But
we note that these high levels have been hard to reach
1010 in Ref. [16]. We also
in practice, although Q

note that there has been a tendency to get lower quality
factors when applying stronger ﬁelds. However, in Ref.
[21], it has been shown that it is possible to reach surface
ﬁelds of the order of the critical level without signiﬁcant

decrease of the Q-factor. Thus adopting Q = 4

we obtain

0.5 K, thus
Keeping the cavity at a temperature T
means that the number of generated photons in our ex-
ample is well above the thermal ﬂuctuation level Nth =
1/[exp(¯hω3/kT )
7, where k is the Boltzmann con-
stant. To get an even lower thermal ﬂuctuation level, it
would be of interest to generate photons with higher fre-
quencies. However, it is not wise to just scale down the
dimensions used above to get ¯hω3/kT > 1 and Nth
1,
since NQED decreases too quickly with the cavity volume.
Instead we could consider higher mode numbers n1,2,3
and higher orders of β to get a larger excited eigenfre-
quency fulﬁlling ¯hω3/kT > 1 which gives a higher ratio
NQED/Nth.

≪

On the other hand, detecting a very weak signal in the
presence of strong pump ﬁelds might be diﬃcult even
for signals well above the thermal ﬂuctuation level, and
thus we will below investigate the possibility of a cavity
geometry that directly ﬁlters away the pump signals.

V. CAVITY FILTERING GEOMETRY

We search for a cavity geometry with the following

properties:

1. The cavity should be rotationally symmetric

2. There should be three eigenmodes with frequencies

fulﬁlling (2)

3. There should be a cylindrical interaction region
where the mode structure resembles that consid-
ered in the previous section.

4. There should be a ﬁltering region with a cross sec-
tion small enough to give an exponential decay of

the pump modes, but large enough for the excited
eigenmode to propagate.

5. There should be an entrance region for the pump

modes.

−

We thus make a geometrical design of the type out-
lined above, see Figs. 1a,b,c. The eigenmodes are then
calculated using the method of ﬁnite elements. In gen-
eral there will be eigenmodes with the desired proper-
ties, except that they will not fulﬁl Eq. (2) for the spec-
iﬁed geometry. However, by repeated calculations vary-
ing the length l of the cavity, the mismatch frequency
δω(l) = ω3(l)
2ω1(l) + ω2(l) gradually approaches zero.
The dimensions of the cavity and the corresponding mode
structure is shown in Figs 1 a,b,c. As can be seen, the
pump modes have decreased their amplitudes by a factor
of the order of 106, from the interaction region to the
end of the ﬁltering region (to the left), whereas mode 3
has essentially the same amplitude in both regions. By
increasing the ﬁltering distance, the pump signals could
of course be reduced further. Naturally a ﬁltering ge-
ometry will make the mode coupling somewhat weaker,
as compared to our pure cylinder example. By adding a
ﬁltering region of roughly the same size as the coupling
Kcyl/√2,
region, the coupling factor reduces to Kﬁl
in which case we keep the same number of excited pho-
tons if we choose the size of the total cavity region to be
roughly twice the size of the cylinder cavity presented in
the previous section.

VI. NONLINEARITIES IN THE WALLS OF
THE CAVITY

To our knowledge, a well-established and simple non-
linear model for the superconducting RF-state does not
exist. As a starting point for a discussion, we may adopt
a model with a nonlinear magnetic third order suscepti-
bility M i = χijlklBjBkBl, using the Einstein summation
convention, and deﬁning the susceptibility in terms of B
rather than H. We then consider the same geometry of
the cavity and the eigenmodes as in section IV. The mag-
netic z-components of the pump ﬁelds penetrate roughly
a skin depth inside the walls. For a nonzero value of
χ3333
χnl, the part of the nonlinear magnetization that
can act as a source for mode 3 is then M3 = χnlB2
z.
Acoordingly we get currents in the azimuthal direction
M3, which in turn may induce radial vari-
J3ϕ
b
ations in the magnetic ﬁeld B3z(ρ) = (µ0/ρ)
J3ϕρdρ.
At the same time, the jump in the nonlinear susceptibil-
ity across the vacuum/superconductor boundary causes
a jump in the magnetization, and thereby a surface cur-
rrent j3s =
ρ. A combination of the surface and
bulk currents then yields a nonlinearly induced magnetic
ﬁeld inside the vacuum region

where λ should be much larger than the skin depth such
that J3ϕ(λ) is negligible. Carrying out the integration
in Eq. (20), we see that the two terms cancel such that
B3z|ρ<a = 0, i.e. the nonlinear currents do not induce a
magnetic ﬁeld inside the cavity.
We stress that this is not a proof that nonlinearities
in the walls generally are unable to aﬀect the physics
inside the cavity. However, it suggests that a nonlinear
current in the walls with the proper eigenfrequency does
not by necessity excite the corresponding eigenmode of
the cavity.

VII. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

In the present paper we have materialized our proposal
for the detection of elastic photon-photon scattering [15].
In particular, we have calculated the output level of scat-
tered photons in terms of the allowed pump ﬁeld strength
and the cavity quality factors for a reactangular prism as
well as for a cylindrical geometry. Furthermore, we have
made ﬁnite element calculations to show that the reso-
nance and frequency matching conditions can be fulﬁlled
in a ﬁltering geometry, where only the scattered mode has
a high enough frequency to reach the cavity region with a
lower cross-section. Using performance data from current
state-of-the-art superconducting niobium cavities, where
1010 is combined with sur-
a high quality factor Q
≈
face ﬁeld strengths close to the critical value B
0.28
Tesla, we deduce that the number of scattered photons
can reach N
18 in a cylindrical cavity with length 2.5
m and 25 cm radius. In a ﬁltering geometry we estimate
that the number of photons/volume will be reduced by a
factor of order 2, as compared to the pure cylinder case.
Recent results [16, 17], where measurements involving
transitions in Rydberg atoms interacting with single mi-
crowave photons have been made, strongly suggest that
the estimated ﬁeld levels are within the range detectable
with present day technology.

We note that, in principle, nonlinearities in the walls
of the cavity may lead to excitation of the same mode
as caused by the QED nonlinearities. Our simple model
calculation in section VI suggests that the mode-coupling
due to such an eﬀect vanishes. However, a more rigorous
treatment is necessary to draw deﬁnite conclusions. QED
theory predicts a deﬁnite output level of mode 3. Ex-
periments that result in a much higher level would thus
indicate that nonlinearities in the walls play the main
role.

Finite element analysis, may provide a starting point
for a suitable design of the cavity. However, the degree
of ﬁne tuning of the resonance frequencies of the modes
is very high, since for optimal performance the mismatch
of the eigenfrequencies should not exceed δω
ω/Q.
Hence the ﬁnal adjustments of the cavity geometry must
be made experimentally.

FIG. 1: The geometry of the cavity and the mode structure for the ﬁltering geometry. Note that only half of the cavity is
shown, since the other half is redundant due to rotational symmetry of the cavity as well as the ﬁelds. The small region to
the right is the entrance region, the large middle region is where the interaction takes place, and the region to the left is the
ﬁltering region. All modes have the electric ﬁeld in the angular direction, i.e. E = E(ρ, z)
ϕ. The variations of ln |E(ρ, z)| are
shown in color code.
a) The mode structure of pump mode 1. The exponential decay in the region of small cross-section diminishes the amplitude
by a factor 10
b) The mode structure of pump mode 2. The exponential decay in the region of small cross-section diminishes the amplitude
by a factor 10
c) The mode structure of the excited mode. The amplitude is roughly the same in the region of interaction and in the ﬁltered
region.

Abstract

A new combined PIC-MCC approach is developed for accurate and fast sim-
ulation of a radio frequency discharge at low gas pressure and high density of
plasma. Test calculations of α − γ transition in a ccrf discharge in helium and
argon show a good agreement with experimental data. We demonstrate high
eﬃciency of the combined PIC-MCC algorithm, especially for the collisionless
regime of electron heating.

I. INTRODUCTION

The modern trends of plasma technologies are directed to a reduction of the gas pressure
and an increase of plasma density. The further development of eﬃcient methods is required
for simulation of collisionless regimes in a capacitevely coupled and especially in an induc-
tively coupled discharges as the collisionless heating of electrons plays a key role in dynamics
of thin skin layers. The Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Collisions (PIC-MCC) method [1] has
become a standard simulation technique for a gas discharge in plasma reactors of etching
or deposition. Unlike the ﬂuid approach, the PIC-MCC algorithm requires larger computer
resources, but it provides a detail kinetic picture of processes in a gas discharge. However,
a problem of statistical ﬂuctuations of an electric ﬁeld appears at low gas pressures, in par-
ticular for gases with a deep Ramsauer minimum in the elastic scattering cross section. For
the periodic electrical ﬁeld E = E0 sin(ωt), where ω is the discharge frequency, the rate of
electron heating in the bulk is proportional to νE2
0 /(ω2 + ν2), where ν is electron collision
frequency. At high gas pressure in the collisional regime, when ν > ω, the electric ﬁeld in
the quasineutral plasma is suﬃciently large and the eﬀect the artiﬁcial electron heating is
less dangerous. At the low gas pressure in the collisionless regime (at ν < ω), the electrons
In the quasineutral plasma the electric ﬁeld is

small and the electrons scattering on the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations essentially distorts the results.
Although the numerical smoothing of the charge density [2] helps to diminish the statistical
noise, it is necessary to develop a more radical way for reduction of the inﬂuence of statistical
ﬂuctuations.

An interesting idea was suggested in Ref. [3]. As the discharge simulation lasts more
than one thousand of discharge periods, the averaging of the charge density over several
periods reduces the statistical noise. But the direct averaging can lead to the development
of the numerical instability. To eliminate this problem, the electric ﬁeld was calculated in
Ref. [3] from the current continuity equation. However, this approach requires an explicit
distinction of electrode sheaths, that is diﬃcult for realization in the two-dimensional case.
Besides, it does not take into account inertia of electrons, which is very important at the
low gas pressure. Below we present another way of the noise reduction in a new approach
developed by Vitaly Schweigert.

II. COMBINED PIC-MCC APPROACH

In the combined PIC-MCC approach we ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld distribution from the aux-
iliary equations which are derived from the kinetic equations. The integration of the electron
and ion kinetic equations over the velocity gives us the continuity equations for electron and
ion densities. The integration of the kinetic equations multiplied by the velocity gives the
continuity equations for electron and ion ﬂuxes. The kinetic coeﬃcients are calculated with
using the electron and ion distribution functions, which are found from the electron and
ion kinetic equations. To avoid the kinetic coeﬃcients ﬂuctuations we average them over
many periods. Thus, in our model the kinetic equations, the auxiliary equations and the
Poisson equation are solved self-consistently. The kinetic approach allows us to ﬁnd the ki-
netic coeﬃcients and the electric ﬁeld distribution is found from the auxiliary equation. The
equation system includes the Boltzmann kinetic equations for velocity distribution functions

cross section. Notice that in the usual ﬂuid approach the terms Qe, Qi are supposed to be
zero, which is correct only for the constant scattering frequencies. The boundary conditions
for the auxiliary equations includes the secondary emission as in Ref. [4]. It can be easily

The reduction of statistical noise in our approach is reached with averaging the kinetic coef-
ﬁcients Q, T ′
i , Qe, Qi over many periods and with smoothing over the spatial coordinate.
For averaging a function F (x) over preceding periods we use the following algorithm

e, T ′

F (x)i = αF (x)′i + (1 − α)F (x)i−1,

where F (x)′i is the value on the i-period and α = 0.01 ÷ 0.1. The spatial smoothing is
chosen as in Ref. [2]

F (xk) =

F (xk+1) + 2F (xk) + F (xk−1)
4

,

where xk is the node of the simulation grid. The spatial smoothing is very important for
resolving the space charge in the quasineutral part of a discharge, where the charge is a
small diﬀerence of two large and almost equal values (ion and electron densities). The
computer resources for solving the transport equations (3)-(6) are much smaller than for the
kinetic equations, therefore the auxiliary equations are solved for each period, and the kinetic
coeﬃcients are calculated after several periods from the kinetic equations (1),(2). Then the
electron and ion weights are ﬁtted with the densities n′
i. We use 5000 simulation particles
for each charged species, the Cloud-in-Cell charge assignment scheme, the null-collisions
technique to ﬁnd the time of electron and ion free ﬂight, and the energy conserving scheme
with a second order of accuracy to solve the equations of motion [2,5]. The equations (3)-(6)
are solved with an implicit ﬁnite-diﬀerence method with using the Scharfetter and Gummel
scheme [6]. For small grid spacing Te ≫ e|φk+1 − φk| this ﬁnite–diﬀerence scheme has a
second order accuracy in △x and gives a correct result on rough grids for the Boltzmann
electron distribution. Like for the explicit PIC-MCC method, there exists a restriction on
time step ωp △ t < 1, where ωp is the plasma frequency, for solution of the equations (3)-(6)
with the Poisson equation (10).

e, n′

Since the cross section of the electron Coulomb scattering is proportional to the electron
density and inversely proportional to the square of the electron energy, a correct discharge
simulation of some regimes requires accounting for electron Coulomb collisions. For descrip-
tion of these collisions we apply the method [7], where the Langevin force and friction of
electrons are introduced and deﬁned from their distribution function. Note also, that the
Coulomb collisions do not change the total electron momentum of motion.

4

The test calculations show that this algorithm is numerically stable and allows one to
reach a signiﬁcant acceleration of the PIC-MCC method due to two factors. At ﬁrst, the
time step for solving the kinetic equations (1),(2) with implicit scheme does not depend on
the plasma frequency [2,8]. At second, averaging over many periods allows one to reduce
greatly (in 5-20 times) the total number of simulation particles in the PIC-MCC method
without an increase of the statistical noise.

III. HOW MANY SIMULATION PARTICLES WE NEED?

We study a capacitively coupled radio frequency (ccrf) discharge in argon and helium
with the combined PIC-MCC approach for the experimental conditions of Godyak et al [9].
We consider an one-dimensional symmetrical ccrf discharge at room temperature for the
frequency ν = 13.56 MHz and with the sinusoidal shape of the discharge current j. One
electrode is grounded and the voltage on another electrode is calculated self-consistently to
provide the desired amplitude of the discharge current.

The spatial grid has typically 81 nodes, condensing in electrode sheaths. The minimal
grid spacing is decreased with the gas pressure rise, thus the sheath contains approximately
the constant number of nodes. The cross sections of electron scattering in helium are taken
from [10], and for argon from [3,10]. The ion–electron emission on electrodes is taken into
account with coeﬃcient 0.2 in helium and 0.1 in argon.

It is known that the statistical error of Monte-Carlo methods decreases as 1/N 2. The
statistical noise leads to the systematical error in the electron cooling or heating. Therefore,
ﬁrst we have studied the impact of the number of simulation particles on an accuracy of
results in three diﬀerent methods: in the standard PIC-MCC [1], in the PIC-MCC with the
spatial smoothing (PIC-MCC SS) [2] and in our combined PIC-MCC. The simulations are
performed for two values of argon pressures P = 0.1, 0.3 Torr, the inter-electrode distance
d = 2 cm and the discharge current j = 2.65 mA/cm2. The mean electron energy in the
discharge center calculated with three methods and measured in Ref. [9] is shown in Fig. 1.
The calculations with the standard PIC-MCC method with diﬀerent N show a signiﬁcant
role of electric ﬁeld ﬂuctuations under the lower gas pressure (squares in Fig. 1(a)). It is seen
that the standard PIC-MCC considerably overestimates the value of ǫ for N = 4000÷256000.
The second method (PIC-MCC SS) gives much better results (circles in Fig. 1). The spatial
smoothing indeed decreases the statistical noise, but feasibility of this technique is restricted,
since it distorts the space charge in the electrode sheath. At gas pressure P = 0.3 Torr (see,
Fig. 1(b)) when the electron energy ǫ increases with N, the PIC-MCC SS method shows
the reasonable accuracy (within 10%) with small number of simulation particles N = 10000.
But at the lower pressure P = 0.1 Torr, the PIC-MCC SS is not able to provide convergency
in the electron energy even with N = 256000.
It is obvious that at low gas pressure in
order to obtain the reasonable solution with the standard PIC-MCC methods we need so an
enormous number of the simulation particles that these methods are not more applicable.
As seen in Fig. 1 our combined PIC-MCC method gives the electron energy which is very
close to the experimental one (see, Fig. 2) already with the small number of simulation
particles and the results only weakly depend on N. The electron density and the mean
electron energy from the experiment [9] and from the combined PIC MCC simulations with
N = 5000 are shown in Fig. 2 as a function of gas pressure. The calculated dependence of

the ǫ from P demonstrates the transition between diﬀerent modes of the electron heating
found in [9] and well agrees with the experimental data.

IV. VALIDITY OF THE COMBINED PIC-MCC APPROACH. SIMULATION
RESULTS OF A CCRF DISCHARGE IN HELIUM AND ARGON.

Depending on gas pressure, there are two diﬀerent regimes of electron heating (collision
and collisionless) in rf discharges which are well studied experimentally and numerically (see,
for example [9,1,11–14]). The collision electron heating takes place due to elastic scattering
of the electrons on the atoms, when the directed velocity transfers into the thermal one.
At high gas pressures the collisonal (or ohmic) heating controls the electron energy in the
quasineutral part of the discharge. At the low gas pressure the electrons are heated due to
interaction with moving sheaths boundaries and the ohmic heating in bulk is very small. For
these two regimes the spatial distributions of the electron density, the electrical potential,
the mean electron energy and the electron heating rate Wh = −eE
vexfed~ve are shown
in Figs. 3,4 in helium and argon, respectively. The results are obtained for two diﬀerent
gas pressures P = 0.03 Torr and P = 0.3 Torr, for d = 6.7 cm and j = 1 mA/cm2. As
expected, in helium the mean electron energy increases with pressure lowering in order to
compensate an increase of particle losses at the electrodes and in argon we observed the
opposite behavior. The reasons of reduction of the electron energy under pressure lowering
in argon are discussed in [15], where a drop of the electron temperature up to the gas
temperature is predicted in the absence of Coulomb electron collisions. Note, that in helium
larger heating rate (in the center of discharge) refers to lower ǫ. This non-local eﬀect can
not be predicted within the ﬂuid or the diﬀusion-drift approaches.

R

The electron energy probability functions (EEPF) are shown in Fig. 5 for helium and
argon. The data presented in Fig. 5 averaged over the discharge period. As in the experiment
[9] we also found in argon that the EEPF changes from a Druyvesteyn shape to a bi-
Maxwellian one with decreasing the gas pressure. At the low gas pressure the electrons are
separated into two groups. The cold electrons are not able to reach the sheath boundary
and their ohmic heating is very weak due to Ramsauer minimum in the elastic cross section
(see, Fig. 6). The fast electrons heated in the sheaths maintain the discharge operation and
provide the gas ionization.

Fig. 7 presents the computed and measured [9] electron temperature (Te = 2Ue/3) in
the discharge center (x = 3.35 cm). The decrease of the gas pressure is accompanied with a
drop of ǫ. A comparison with experimental data shows a good agreement (within 20 ÷ 30%)
within a pressure range P = 0.03 ÷ 0.3 Torr for helium and for argon. The calculation gives
higher energy at the larger gas pressure P = 1 Torr. The diﬀerence between computed
and measured data at higher gas pressure is likely due to the contribution of metastable
states in the ionization kinetics, especially in helium (see, for example [12]). In the model
of electron-neutral collisions in our simulations we do not take into account the multi-step
ionization. At low gas pressures we have better agreement because the metastable atoms
are deactivated on electrodes and the inﬂuence of multi-step ionization reduces. The study
of ionization kinetics in noble gases is out of the scope of this article. Note that in our
earlier study [16] of the ccrf discharge in helium we have considered the metastable atoms
and obtained a good agreement with experimental data for high gas pressures.

In conclusion we have presented the combined PIC-MCC approach for fast simulation of
the rf discharge over a wide range of gas pressures and current densities. The validity of the
new approach is justiﬁed by comparison with the experiment data. The advantage of our
approach is the considerable decrease of the number of simulation particles N. We are able
to reach a speed-up factor of ten for the collision regime and even more for the collisionless
regime compared with the standard PIC-MCC calculations.

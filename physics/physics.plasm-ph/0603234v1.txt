(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Drift space is a region free from externally applied ﬁelds. It is an important part of many devices
involving charged particle beams. The space charge eﬀect imposes a limit on the current that can be
transported through a drift space. A reasonable estimate of the space charge limited current density
(J c
SCL) in closed drift tubes can be obtained from electrostatic considerations despite the fact that
charge particle transport results in electromagnetic radiation. We deal here with the situation where
the drift tube is open to electromagnetic radiation, for instance due to the presence of a dielectric
window. In such cases, electromagnetic radiation leaks out of the window which results in a decrease
in the average kinetic energy of electrons. If the injected current density is much lower than J c
SCL,
power loss does not result in a change in the transmitted current. As the injected current density is
increased, power loss increases and at a critical value lower than J c
SCL, reﬂection of electrons begins
to occur. We also show that the lowering of the space charge limited current on account of power
loss can be incorporated in the standard electrostatic picture by introducing an eﬀective voltage for
the collection plate.

INTRODUCTION

The motion of charged particles in a drift space is
of considerable interest in ﬁelds such as high power mi-
crowaves and accelerators [1, 2]. Here, the mutual inter-
action among the charged particles (known as the space
charge eﬀect) plays an important role in the dynamics of
an intense beam in such cases [2]. If a beam of charged
particles is injected into a drift region, space charge forces
oppose the incoming beam. For a low intensity beam,
space charge eﬀect is negligible and the transmitted cur-
rent is equal to the injected current. As the injected
current increases to a certain critical value (commonly
referred to as the space charge limited (SCL) current),
a virtual cathode appears in the drift space from which
some of the electrons turn back to the injecting plane
[2, 3]. As the injected current is increased beyond the
SCL value, the transmitted current decreases and satu-
rates asymptotically to a much smaller value when the
injection energies are non-relativistic.

It is possible to estimate the space charge limited cur-
rent for a non-relativistic electron beam moving in an
inﬁnite parallel plate drift space. The SCL current den-
sity is given by [2, 3]

with the injection velocity v0 =

the separation between the plates. Here e and m0 are
the electron charge and rest mass respectively. On the
other hand, for a relativistic solid beam of radius rb in
an inﬁnitely long drift tube of radius R, a reasonable
approximation is [4]

When the injected current density JIN exceeds J c

proximate analytical value can be obtained from the so
called classical theory in the 1-dimensional case [2, 3].

It should be noted that the above estimates for the
space charge limited current in a drift tube are derived
from electrostatic models.
In reality, the mutually in-
teracting charged particles radiate and in the process,
lose their kinetic energy to the ﬁelds.
In closed drift
tubes, the electrostatic predictions are nevertheless good
as the radiated electromagnetic energy is reabsorbed by
the electrons. However, when a drift tube is open to elec-
tromagnetic radiation, this energy leaks out as we shall
demonstrate here. This leads to a drop in the kinetic
energy of the transported electrons. When the injected
current density, JIN << J c
SCL, the transmitted current
JT R is unaﬀected by the slowing down of electrons as
the charge density increases to compensate for the lower
velocity. However as JIN increases further, reﬂection be-
gins to occur at a value (of JIN ) smaller than J c
SCL. We
shall show here that the lowering of J c
SCL can be pre-
dicted reasonably well within the electrostatic framework
by altering the boundary conditions to account for power
loss.

It may be noted that a similar phenomenon occurs
in open diodes.
It has recently been shown [5] that
leakage of electromagnetic energy from a diode results
in lower transmitted current. Furthermore, the electro-
magnetic power loss can be incorporated into the stan-
dard Child-Langmuir[6, 7] expression through an eﬀec-
tive voltage. For a given applied potential diﬀerence and
anode-cathode separation, the modiﬁed Child-Langmuir
law can also be used to predict the maximum power that
can leak from an open-diode [5].

In this paper, we present results of particle-in-cell

(PIC) simulation for open drift tubes. In section II, we
demonstrate that an opening in the drift tube allows ra-
diation to leak out and lowers the kinetic energy of elec-
trons. We next show that the critical current density
at which reﬂection begins to occur in open drift tubes
(J o
SCL) is lower as compared to closed drift tubes. We
also show that the transmitted current decreases as the
injected current is increased beyond J o
SCL. In section III,
we propose that the power loss in open drift tubes can be
incorporated within the electrostatic framework by intro-
ducing an eﬀective voltage for the collection plate. The
predictions of this eﬀective energy theory is then com-
pared with PIC simulations. Finally, the signiﬁcance of
this study and a summary of our results are presented in
the concluding section.

II. POWER LOSS IN OPEN DRIFT TUBES

We shall ﬁrst demonstrate that an opening in the drift
tube leads to power loss in the form of electromagnetic
radiation and hence to a lowering of the kinetic energy of
electrons reaching the far end of the drift tube (hereafter
referred to as the collection plate).

The drift tube under consideration is a metallic cylin-
drical cavity with one end partially open (see ﬁg.1). The
radius of the collection plate (RCP ) is varied in the simu-
lation. The electrons are injected from the injection plate
in the axial direction with uniform velocity. The radius
R1 of the drift tube is taken to be 12.5 cm while the
length L is 2.5 cm. An electron beam of radius 3.5 cm is
used with an injection energy of 50 KeV.

The results presented here have been obtained using
the fully electromagnetic two and half dimensional PIC
code XOOPIC [8]. The cavity wall is considered as “Con-

ductor” in the simulation; the emission model is chosen to
be “VarWeightBeamEmitter” while the open window is
modelled by an “Exitport”. The number of mesh points
in the radial and the axial directions is typically 64 and
128 respectively. The time step is typically taken to be
4 × 10−13 s. Note that there is no externally applied
magnetic ﬁeld in the simulation.

For the injection energy and plate separation under
consideration, Eq. 1 predicts the space charge limited
current I c
SCL = 1283 amperes. While this is strictly
true for inﬁnite parallel plates separated by a distance
L, for the closed cylindrical drift tube geometry (RCP =
12.5cm), our PIC simulations show that ISCL ≃ 1320.
Hereafter, we shall refer to this value as I c
SCL(2) where
the superscript c refers to the closed drift tube and (2)
refers to the 2-dimensional case.

In order to demonstrate that charge particle trans-
port indeed results in electromagnetic radiation which
can leak out from an open drift tube, we have carried
out a simulation with the radius of the collection plate
RCP = 8 cm and the injected current IIN = 500 A.
The electromagnetic power emitted from the open area
is plotted in ﬁg. 2.
In order to account for this power
loss, we also plot the energy distribution of the electrons
reaching the collection plate in ﬁg. 3.

As reﬂection of electrons does not occur at this value
of injected current, the ratio eP/IT R ≃ e 6670/500 =
13.34 KeV is the average energy loss that a single electron
suﬀers.
In other words, the average kinetic energy of
electrons reaching the collection plate should be 36.66
KeV. This should reﬂect in the energy distribution of
electrons at the collection plate.
Indeed Fig. 3 shows
that the kinetic energy peaks at 36.9 KeV which agrees
well with the value expected from energy conservation.

It is thus clear that electrons lose energy in the form
of electromagnetic radiation and as a result slow down.
This leads to an increase in charge density and hence en-
hances the space charge eﬀect. For the values of injected
current, energy and power loss in the above example, the
space charge eﬀect is not large enough to cause reﬂection
of electrons. As the injected current is increased fur-

ther, power loss increases as well thereby leading to an
increase in charge density. For the open drift tube under
consideration, reﬂection occurs at I o
SCL ≃ 920 as evident
from the phase space (z, uz = γvz) plots at IIN = 910
and 925 amperes (see Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, an opening
in the drift tube lowers the space charge limited current
due to an enhancement of space charge eﬀect caused by
the slowing down of electrons.

The magnitude of power loss depends on the trans-
mitted current as also the size of the opening. Thus,
the space charge limited current should decrease as the
size of the opening increases. In Fig. 6, the critical cur-
rent is plotted against RCP . For smaller openings (large
RCP ), power loss is small and thus I o
SCL is close to (but
less than) I c
SCL(2). As the size of the opening increases,
power loss increases thereby reducing the space charge
limited current. As the opening increases further, the
drop in space charge limited current reduces the ﬁeld en-
ergy produced suﬃciently so that power loss no longer
increases as the opening is increased further. This is il-
lustrated in Fig. 7 where the power starts reducing at
smaller openings.

IIN > I o
SCL for three diﬀerent openings. As in case of
a closed drift space (1-dimensional case) [2], the trans-
mitted current drops as the injected current is increased
beyond I o
SCL. Note that the “classical theory” for the 1-
dimensional case predicts a drop in the transmitted cur-
rent beyond I c
SCL and a gradual decay to I c
SCL/8 there-
after.

III. THE EFFECTIVE VOLTAGE THEORY FOR
DRIFT TUBES

In the previous section we have seen that radiative
power loss due to an opening in the drift tube leads to
an equivalent drop in the electron energy reaching the
collection plate. Recall that in the standard electrostatic
picture [2], the emission and collection plate are at the
same potential V where eV is the kinetic energy of the
injected electrons. Eq. 1 follows on solving Poisson equa-
tion and demanding that the potential minima be posi-
tive.

For completeness, we have also studied the regime with

For open drift tubes, power loss can be incorporated

within the electrostatic picture by modifying the bound-
ary conditions appropriately. The loss of electron kinetic
energy to electromagnetic radiation is equivalent to hav-
ing the collection plate potential at a value P/IIN lower
than the emission plate potential. Thus, if the emission
and collection plates are at z = 0 and z = L respectively,

φ(0) = V
φ(L) = V − P/IIN

where P is the electromagnetic power lost through the
open window. Note that in steady state (no reﬂection)
IT R = IIN . The space charge limited current for open
drift space can thus be determined by demanding that
the potential minima be positive.

Equivalently, one may study the open drift tube prob-
lem as a diode with non-zero injection energy E [9, 10]
having plate potentials

φ(L) = V0.

Note that Eq. 8 does not directly give the space charge
limited current. Instead, for each allowed power loss P ,
one must ﬁnd the roots of Eq. 8 to determine the space
charge limited current I o
SCL. When P = 0 (closed drift
tube), J o
SCL(2). As the power loss
increases, the number and values of allowed (positive)
roots of Eq. 8 can be determined. However beyond a
certain power loss, Pmax, there is no allowed root of Eq. 8.
There is thus a maximum value of electromagnetic power
loss for a given drift tube geometry and injection energy.
Fig. 9 illustrates these phases for the open drift tube
under consideration. The solid line represents the roots of
Eq. 8 for each value of power loss P and with αg = 1.03.
The transmitted current is maximum when the drift tube
is closed and P = 0. Note that as P increases from 0 to

P1 ≃ 8.4, there is a single allowed value of ISCL. This
follows from Eq. 8 on noting that the expression within
the square root must be positive. At P1 for instance,
the allowed values of current must exceed ISCL = 168.
For P > P1, there are two admissible roots and these
correspond to the case with (i) small opening and large
current and (ii) larger opening but smaller current. Be-
yond Pmax ≃ 21.65, there is no allowed current for the
given geometry and injection energy. Fig. 9 also shows
our PIC simulation results (solid squares) for values of
RCP ranging from 4.5 cm to 12 cm. The agreement with
the theoretical prediction is reasonably good.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In the preceding sections, we have studied the eﬀect of
electromagnetic power loss on the space charge limited
current in open drift tubes. We have demonstrated using
PIC simulations that even well below the space charge

limited current, there is power loss which reﬂects in the
kinetic energy of electrons reaching the collection plate.
The slowing down of electrons however does not aﬀect
the transmitted current as long as the injected current
is small. As the injected current increases, the power
loss increases as well thereby leading to an enhancement
of space charge eﬀect. Thus the space charge limit is
reached earlier in open drift tubes.

We have also shown that an estimate of the space
charge limited current in open drift tubes can be ob-
tained from electrostatic considerations by modifying
the boundary conditions appropriately using an eﬀective
voltage so as to reﬂect the loss in energy of electrons. The
predictions of this theory are in close agreement with PIC
simulations.

A fallout of this theory is the existence of a limit for
the electromagnetic power emanating from a given open
drift tube geometry and injections energy. This can be
proﬁtably used in the design of devices used for the ex-
traction of electromagnetic power [12].

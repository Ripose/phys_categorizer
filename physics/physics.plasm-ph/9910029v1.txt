Parametric Excitation of Alfv´en Waves by Gravitational Radiation

M. Servin, G.Brodin and M. Bradley
Department of Plasma Physics, Ume˚a University, S-901 87 Ume˚a, Sweden

We consider the parametric excitation of Alfv´en waves by gravitational radiation propagating on
a Minkowski background, parallel to an external magnetic ﬁeld. As a starting point, standard
ideal MHD equations incorporating the curvature of space time has been derived. The growth
rate of the Alfv´en waves has been calculated, using the normal mode approach. It turns out that
generally the coupling coeﬃcients of the wave modes does not satisfy the Manley-Rowe relations.
As a consequence, we may have a positive growth rate even if one of the decay waves have a higher
frequency than the gravitational pump wave. Finally we discuss various astrophysical applications
of our investigation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Interaction of electromagnetic ﬁelds with gravitational
radiation has been studied by several authors [1-19]. Be-
sides a purely theoretical interest in such phenomena,
there is a number of diﬀerent applications. For example
in astrophysics [1-5], in cosmology [6] and under labora-
tory conditions [7-10], where - in the later case - the goal
is to ﬁnd suitable mechanisms to detect gravitational ra-
diation. Furthermore, there are many examples of gravi-
tational wave interaction that may take place in plasmas.
This has been studied during the eighties by a group at
the Kazan School of gravitation (see for example [1,10,11]
and references therein) and more recently by Refs. 4, 12,
13 and 14.

In Ref. 12 it was shown that parametric excitation of
high frequency plasma waves by gravitational radiation
may take place. Due to the frequency matching condi-
tions, however, the plasma must be very thin for that pro-
cess to be possible, and the amount of energy transfer is
therefore limited. In the present paper we will thus con-
sider parametric excitation of low frequency MHD waves
by gravitational waves, which - in contrast - may take
place in a comparatively dense plasma. The relevance of
this problem for the conversion of gravitational wave en-
ergy to the plasma inside supernovas has previously been
discussed by Ref. 14. However, due to the complexity of
the physical situation, a highly idealized model will be
studied, where a one dimensional monochromatic gravi-
tational wave - superimposed on a ﬂat background met-
ric - propagates through a homogeneous two component
plasma.

The organization of the paper is as follows: In section
II idealized MHD-equations incorporating the eﬀects of
the gravitational wave are derived, starting from covari-
ant two ﬂuid equations. In section III parametric exci-
tation of shear Alfv´en and magnetosonic waves are con-
sidered, the three wave coupling coeﬃcients are derived
and the growth rate is found. By adding a phenomeno-
logical resistivity to the equations, the threshold value of
the gravitational amplitude is also calculated. Finally,

in section IV, our results are summarized and theoretical
considerations like the (non-) fulﬁllment of Manley-Rowe
relations as well as possible applications are discussed.

II. RELATIVISTIC MHD-EQUATIONS

In order to obtain general relativistic ﬂuid equations
governing a plasma we begin by considering a system con-
sisting of a charged perfect ﬂuid and an electromagnetic
ﬁeld [20].
Introducing the restframe scalar quantities:
mass density (or rather energy density times 1/c2) ρ(m),
charge density ρ(q), pressure p and the 4-velocity ﬁeld
(or ﬂuid velocity) uµ ≡ dxµ/dτ and 4-current density
jµ ≡ ρ(q)uµ, where τ is the proper time and xµ coor-
dinates in the lab frame, this system is characterized by
having the energy-momentum tensor T µν = T µν
(em),
where

and where Fµν is the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor satis-
fying Maxwell’s equations

F µν

;ν = −µ0jµ

Fµν;σ + Fνσ;µ + Fσµ;ν = 0

We have adopted the convention that Greek suﬃxes
µ, ν, .. have the range 0, 1, 2, 3 and i, j, .. have the range
1, 2, 3 and metric tensor gµν has the signature (+ - - - ).
The conservation laws of the system follows from that
the 4-divergence of the energy-momentum tensor van-
ishes, i.e. T µν
;µ = 0, and with the use of Maxwell’s equa-
tions one gets

where eq.(3) is obtained by projection along the 4-
velocity uµ. This equation is identiﬁed as energy balance
in the rest-frame of matter and gives the equation of con-
tinuity (mass conservation) in the non relativistic limit.
Equation (4) gives for ν = 0 the energy balance (modulo
the content of (3), i.e., energy balance in the non rela-
tivistic limit) and for ν = 1, 2, 3 momentum balance.

Under the conditions of low internal energy the ﬂuid
description of a plasma can be simpliﬁed by putting, for
each particle species of the plasma, ρ(m) = mn where n is
the restframe particle density and m is the particle mass.
Also without these restrictions we may put ρ(q) = qn
where q is the particle charge. Suppose we have a plasma
consisting of two species of particles oppositely charged
(i.e. q1/q2 = −1), but, in general, with distinct masses.
For each species we assign a ﬂuid satisfying the equations
(3) and (4). The ﬂuids are assumed interpenetrating and
interacting through the electromagnetic ﬁeld and, in gen-
eral, the gravitational ﬁeld. We neglect the eﬀect of par-
ticle collisions. If we assume non-relativistic pressure, i.e.
such that mn ≫ p/c2, and non-relativistic ﬂuid veloci-
ties - in the sense that we may neglect quadratic terms
in 1/c in the ν 6= 0 components of eq.(4) - then we have,
for each of the two ﬂuids, equations for conservation of
particles (or mass) and momentum in the form

(nuµ);µ = 0

mnuµui

;µ = gijp,j + F i

µqnuµ

Maxwell’s equations remain the same if we let jµ be the
total current density.

Under the conditions that for both species ∂t ∼ ω ≪ ωc
and CA ≪ c, this two-ﬂuid description can be cast into
a set of single-ﬂuid equations. By ∂t ∼ ω we mean
that a characteristic frequency, ω, can be assigned to
the time variations in the dynamical quantities [21].
We use ωc ≡ |q|B/m for the cyclotron frequency, B
is the magnetic ﬁeld intensity (which can be obtained
from the Lorentz frame components of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld tensor) and CA is the Alfv´en velocity, de-
A = B2/µ0n. Under the above conditions it
ﬁned by C2
follows that the two ﬂuid velocities are approximately
equal and that the particle densities may be regarded
as exactly equal. Furthermore, we let the equation of
state be the one of isothermal compression and assume
|uµui
jqnuj|/mn (meaning
that the electric and magnetic forces approximately bal-
ance each other). In light of this, we obtain the following
set of single ﬂuid equations (MHD-equations)

0qnu0|/mn ∝ |F i

Equation (5) and (6) are obtained by adding the two
particle conservation equations and the two equations of
momentum balance, respectively, and setting the veloc-
ities equal (when added), letting j be the total current
density, p the total pressure and T ≡ T(1) + T(2). The suf-
ﬁxes (1) and (2) refers to the two distinct particle species.
By subtracting the two equations of momentum conser-
vation, where the terms uµui
;µ have been neglected, one
ﬁnds eq. (7), which we refer to as the generalized Ohm’s
law.

0u0 and F ı

Note that if the right hand side of eq. (7) is negligi-
juj this equation simply
ble as compared to F ı
reads F i
µuµ = 0 and we can then refer to the single-
ﬂuid equations as the ideal MHD-equations. In the fol-
lowing we limit ourselves to this case. Note that the
MHD-equations are not independent of Maxwell’s and
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, since we used Maxwell’s equa-
tions and T µν
;µ = 0, that follows from Einstein’s equa-
tions, in deriving them.

We now consider gravitational

radiation on a
Minkowski background treating the plasma as a testﬂuid.
Thus, the plasma back scattering eﬀect on the gravita-
tional ﬁeld is lost. The gravitational radiation is chosen
to be weak gravitational waves in the transverse traceless
(TT) gauge propagating in the x3-direction. This plane
wave solution of the linearized Einstein ﬁeld equations
can be written

ds2 = c2dt2 − (1 + h+)dx2 − (1 − h+)dy2

−2h×dxdy − dz2

where h ≡ ˜heikµxµ
+ c.c. and |˜h| ≪ 1 with the wave
vector [kµ] = (ω/c, 0, 0, k) satisfying the dispersion re-
lation kµkµ = 0.
In all the following calculations we
neglect terms that are quadratic in ˜h or higher. The
metric tensor can thus be written as gµν = ηµν + hµν
where ηµν is the metric tensor of Minkowski space and
hµν represents the small, |hµν | ≪ 1, ﬂuctuation in the
gravitational ﬁeld.

The nonzero Christoﬀel symbols are then calculated to

By expanding the covariant derivative, eq.(5 ) becomes

gµν = ηµν − hµν to ﬁrst order, such that gij = −δij − hij

where we have introduced the gravitational force-like
term Gi ≡ mnΓi
νµuνuµ, whose components are given
explicitly in the end of this section, and we denote
m = m(1) + m(2) .

Next, we perform the same expansion in Maxwell’s
equations and rewrite them in terms of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld tensor in the form F µ
ν. The idea is to express
all ﬁeld tensor terms in the same form, preferably the one
that gives the most simple expressions. We can separate
F µν
;ν = −µ0jµ into two equations. Setting µ = 0 we
obtain a Poisson-like equation which we discard - since
in the MHD-regime j0 ≈ 0. Setting µ = i we read oﬀ
”Ampere’s law“,

From eq.(2), which by symmetry in F µν is equivalent to
Fµν,σ + Fνσ,µ + Fσµ,ν = 0, we obtain a number of trivial
identities, a generalized equation for ∇·B and ”Faraday’s

For notational purposes it is convenient to introduce an
abstract basis {ˆx, ˆy, ˆz}. The one-ﬂuid equations and the
Maxwell’s equations above can then be written in a vec-
tor representation with an algebraic structure identical
to the Euclidean. We deﬁne

x ≡ xˆx + y ˆy + z ˆz ≡ x1 ˆx + x2 ˆy + x3 ˆz
v ≡ vx ˆx + vy ˆy + vz ˆz ≡ u1 ˆx + u2 ˆy + u3ˆz

(Note that these quantities diﬀer to ﬁrst order in ˜h from
what an observer in the lab system would measure.) One
then obtains the following set of equations governing the
plasma

In addition to eqs. (11)-(16) Maxwell’s equations pro-
for ∇ · B), however it is easy to
duce constraints (e.g.
verify that these constraints are propagated by the equa-
tions of time evolution, (11), (13) and (16).

III. WAVE-WAVE INTERACTIONS

In the absence of any waves we assume to have the
conﬁguration of a static homogeneous, n = n(0), magne-
tized, B = B(0), plasma in Minkowski space. Cartesian
coordinates are chosen ([xµ] = (ct, x, y, z)) for a frame
in which the velocity ﬁeld (and the current density ﬁeld)
vanishes. The gravitational waves are then inferred as
small perturbations to the Minkowski background, as in
the previous section, and the MHD-waves as the existence
of the small ﬂuctuations: n(1), v(1), j(1), E(1), B(1). Fur-
thermore, in order to simplify the algebra, we make the
assumptions that the direction of B(0) is everywhere par-
allel to the direction of propagation of the gravitational
waves, i.e. B(0) = B(0)ˆz, and that the gravitational ra-
diation is polarized such that h+ = 0.

A. Linear Calculations

It is instructive to ﬁrst investigate the linearized the-
ory in some detail. Linearizing the equations (11)-(16) in
the variables h×, n(1), v(1), j(1), E(1), B(1) we ﬁnd that the
gravitational waves do not drive plasma perturbations
linearly. This is a consequence of the direction of prop-
agation of the gravitational wave (parallel to the mag-
netic ﬁeld) that was chosen. Similarly the linear plasma
perturbations are the ordinary MHD-modes. Fourier an-
alyzing we obtain the dispersion relations for the shear
Alfv´en wave

As we intend to study nonlinear wave coupling it is con-
venient to adopt the normal mode method of approach
[22], which typically simpliﬁes the algebra in the nonlin-
ear stage of the calculations. We deﬁne a normal mode
as a linear combination, aα, of the dynamical quantities
that to linear order satisﬁes

∂taα + iωαaα = 0

(20)

The dynamical quantities are now only assumed to have
harmonic spatial dependence, i.e. ∇ = ikα. From eq.

B. Nonlinear Calculations

The aim of this section is to investigate the second
order nonlinear inﬂuence of the gravitational radiation
on the MHD modes described above. In particular we
are interested in the threshold value (for parametric ex-
citation) of the gravitational amplitude, and the growth
rates of the excited MHD waves. We will again assume
that the wave vectors lies in xz-plane, i.e. k = kxˆx + kzˆz
for the MHD-waves, but in contrast to the case of linear
wave modes this is a restriction made in order to simplify
the algebra [23].

We consider coherent three-wave interactions, the
three waves being one gravitational wave and two MHD-
waves, with the matching conditions

ωg = ωI + ωII
kg = kI + kII

(27)
(28)

where I and II are indexing the MHD-waves.
In the
nonlinear regime the normal modes does no longer satisfy
eq.(20), but rather

∂taα + iωαaα = ([∂taα]n.l.)kα

where n.l. denotes (ﬁrst order) nonlinear terms and the
suﬃx kα indicates that terms not oscillating as eik·x van-
ishes due to rapid oscillations. Explicit forms for the right
hand side is found by using the original expressions for
the normal modes - eqs. (21) or (22) - together with eqs.
(11)-(16).

We let index I denote the magnetosonic wave pertur-
bation, index II the Alfv´en wave perturbation and we
use a complex representation (i.e. letting f → f + f ∗ for
all variables, where the star denotes complex conjugate).
Making use of the linear eigenvectors (25) and (26) as ap-
proximations in the nonlinear right hand sides, we obtain
the coupled mode equations

and

∂taI + iωIaI = CI a∗
∂taII + iωIIaII = CII a∗

From eq. (31) one may get the incorrect impression that
the coupling strength diverges in the limit C2
S → 0. Thus
in order to shed some light on our formulas in the cold
limit, we ﬁrst renormalize our normal mode amplitudes

which leads to renormalized coupling coeﬃcients

(34)

Another special case of particular interest is the limit
of parallel propagation, in which the fast magnetosonic
wave becomes identical to a shear Alfv´en wave, but per-
pendicularly polarized to wave II . Again the general
coupling coeﬃcient (31) seem to diverge. However, by
using another renormalization

which gives

aI → aI /κ

CI → CI /κ
CII → κCII

and taking the limit kI x, kII x → 0, we obtain

Since dissipation of the waves have not been included
in our model, the instability threshold value of the grav-
itational amplitude found from (29) and (30) is so far
zero. However, since only weak dissipation is of interest
we can take such eﬀects into account by simply substi-
tuting ∂taα → (∂t +γα)aα in the coupled mode equations
[24], where γα is the linear damping rate of the mode α.
The most common damping mechanism of MHD waves
is that due to ﬁnite resistivity.. Calculating the linear
damping by replacing (12) with E + v × B = ηj, where
η is the resistivity, we ﬁnd γα = ηk2
α/µ0. Next we intro-
duce the (weakly time dependent) normal mode ampli-
tudes, Aα, deﬁned by aα = Aαe−iωαt, where α = I, II.
Substituting these expressions into (29) and (30) tak-
ing the damping into account, we ﬁnd the general form
for the condition of parametric growth of waves |
h×| >
hthr ≡ (γI γII /CI C∗
II )1/2[22], where
h× is the amplitude
of the gravitational wave and hthr is the threshold value
for parametric excitation. In the limit of parallel prop-
agation we ﬁnd from (35) and (36) that the threshold
value hthr reduces to

For the same polarization of the gravitational pump wave
(h+ = 0), and propagation parallel to the external mag-

cannot be excited in the resonant three wave approxima-
tion, since the coupling coeﬃcient then becomes zero: 1)
Two ion-acoustic (or slow magnetosonic) modes. 2) One
ion-acoustic and one Alfv´en wave. 3) Two Alfv´en waves
with the same linear polarization (Note that for the case
considered above, the Alfv´en waves have perpendicular
polarizations in the parallel limit).

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have considered parametric excitation of Alfv´en
waves by gravitational radiation propagating parallel to
the external magnetic ﬁeld. As a starting point, standard
ideal MHD equations (i.e. without special relativistic ef-
fects) incorporating the curvature of space time has been
derived. It should be pointed out that the system of equa-
tions (5) -(8) in principle can be used in situations where
we have strong deviation from Minkowski space time, al-
though the condition of non-relativistic ﬂuid velocities
then limits the applicability. Focusing on the case where
the metric is that of a small amplitude monochromatic
gravitational wave superimposed on ﬂat space-time, the
growth rate for nonlinearly coupled shear Alfv´en and fast
magnetosonic waves have been found, for non-parallel
as well as parallel propagation to the external magnetic
ﬁeld.

An interesting results is that in general the coupling
coeﬃcients CI and CII of eqs. (31) and (32) does not
satisfy the Manley-Rowe relations [22]. Generally such
relations follow from an underlaying Hamiltonian struc-
ture of the governing equations, and assures that each of
the decay products takes energy from the pump wave in
direct proportion to their respective frequencies. Thus
fulﬁllment of the Manley–Rowe relation means that the
parametric process can be interpreted quantum mechan-
ically - i.e. for matching conditions ω0 = ω1 + ω2 we can
think of a three wave process as the decay of a pump wave
quanta with energy ~ω0 into wave quantas with energy
~ω1 and ~ω2 respectively. An interesting consequence is
that generally a lot of three wave decay processes are for-
bidden from the start by the Manley–Rowe relations (for
example the decay of a plasmon into two photons), since
they imply that we only get a positive growth rate when
the pump wave has the highest frequency, in consistence
with the quantum picture [25]. However, in our case it is
easy to verify that the coupling coeﬃcients in (33)-(34)
may result in a positive growth rate (i.e. CI CII > 0) even
if ωg < ωI . Speciﬁcally we can choose ωI > ωg > 0 > ωII
in which case CI CII > 0 for ωI/ωg . 2.6. If violation
of the Manley–Rowe relations is a general feature when
starting from a curved space time, this opens up the pos-
sibility for parametric instabilities which one normally
would consider to be impossible, where one or both of
the decay products have higher frequency than the pump
wave. This is of particular importance since gravitational
radiation generally has a low frequency as compared to
most plasma waves.

In our calculations we have considered a monochro-
matic gravitational pump wave, which could be produced
by binary systems. As seen from (38) (or more generally
from and (31) and (32)), the growth rate roughly is of
the order γ ∼ h×ωg. Thus the plasma parameters n0,
B0 and T do not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the growth rate,

at least as long as the assumptions of the derivation is ful-
ﬁlled. In comparison, Ref. 12 considered the parametric
decay of a gravitational wave into a Langmuir wave and
a high-frequency electromagnetic wave, and presented an
example of a possible astrophysical source of radiation (a
black hole pair). Also in their case the growth rate ful-
ﬁlled γ ∼ h×ωg, and the growth rate was found to be
γ ∼ 10−2 s−1 at a distance of 1/60 au from the source,
where a process at a closer distance were ruled out by the
frequency matching conditions combined with the linear
dispersion relations. In our case the linear dispersion re-
lations and matching conditions allow a parametric pro-
cess closer to the source, and thereby opens up the pos-
sibility for a higher growth rate, although too close to
the source the background plasma may be too inhomo-
geneous and too far from steady state for our calculations
to be applicable.

Furthermore, excitation of MHD waves may take place
in a dense plasma, and therefore processes such as super-
novas are of interest, where gravitational wave absorption
may take place inside the exploding star. In a discussion
of possible mechanisms of absorbing gravitational wave
energy in supernovas Ref. 14 has written ”Since the ef-
fect of acceleration by gravitational waves is independent
of mass of the charge, both the ions and the electron re-
spond in an identical manner, which is not the case for
electromagnetic waves. This means that waves such as
Alfv´en waves which describe oscillation of charge neu-
tral plasma are ideal. The coupling, however, is weak.”
At the present stage of understanding it is too early to
deduce whether signiﬁcant gravitational wave absorption
by MHD waves may occur. Calculations taking into ac-
count the eﬀects of a broad band gravitational spectrum,
plasma inhomogeneities, etc., must ﬁrst be performed.
In particular inhomogeneity scale lengths with a scale
length signiﬁcantly shorter than the wavelength of the
gravitational mode - such as at the plasma boundary
of the supernova - may lead to excitation of MHD sur-
face waves with a signiﬁcantly enhanced growth rate as
compared to the present homogeneous plasma coupling
mechanism. This is in analogy with parametric excita-
tion scenarios for high frequency plasma surface waves
[26], where the surface waves may have a considerably
higher growth rate than the corresponding bulk waves,
provided the inhomogeneity scale length is considerably
shorter than the wave length of the pump wave. Such a
problem, however, is a project for future work.

[20] We could also have started from previous general rel-
ativistic MHD-equations - see e.g. A. M. Anile, Rela-
tivistic ﬂuids and magneto-ﬂuids (Cambridge University
Press 1989) - but the present derivation has a value as
a guide for future generalizations to the case of general
relativistic two-ﬂuid equations.

[21] Naturally the condition ∂/∂t ≪ ωc cannot hold in arbi-
trary reference frames. We assume it to be true in the
restframe of the ﬂuid, but due the condition of non-
relativistic ﬂuid velocities it also holds in all frames of
relevance.

[23] This is an additional restriction as compared to the gen-
eral case, since the choice of gravitational polarization
(i.e. letting h+ = 0) makes the x- and y-axis non equiv-
alent.

[24] We assume that terms that are both nonlinear and pro-
portional to the small dissipation parameter is negligible.
[25] Note that the even in standard plasma problems where
the Manley-Rowe relations are fulﬁlled, the quantum pic-
ture should not be taken too literally, since the process
is indeed nonlinear, and the interaction of single wave
quantas thus is negligible.

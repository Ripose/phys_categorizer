Abstract

The propagation of a streamer near an insulating surface under the inﬂuence

of a transverse magnetic ﬁeld is theoretically investigated. In the weak mag-

netic ﬁeld limit it is shown that the trajectory of the streamer has a circular

form with a radius that is much larger than the cyclotron radius of an elec-

tron. The charge distribution within the streamer head is strongly polarized

by the Lorentz force exerted perpendicualr to the streamer velocity. A critical

magnetic ﬁeld for the branching of a streamer is estimated. Our results are

in good agreement with available experimental data.

Recent experiments [1] on gas breakdown near an insulating surface in a high magnetic

ﬁeld

−→
B have shown new remarkable properties of such discharges. The channel of discharge

in a magnetic ﬁeld appears to have a circular form with radius Rs several orders of magnitude

1

larger than the electronic cyclotron radius. It decreases with increasing B and reaches Rs

∼ 1cm at B ∼ 7T . At higher magnetic ﬁeld the discharge has a branched structure. These

experiments have shown that the streamer propagation cannot be treated as the motion of

a charge particle in crossed external electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds.

Interest in the theory of streamers is usually associated with investigation of gas break-

down phenomena. On an insulating surface near a point electrode, in the region with strong

electric ﬁeld, the discharge has a ﬁlamentary structure. The tip of the ﬁlament moves with

high velocity v0 ( v0 ∼ 108cm/s ), that exceeds the drift velocity vd of electrons in the

streamer head ﬁeld

−→
E s. The increase of external electric ﬁeld

−→
E results in penetration of

some ﬁlaments ( so called ”leaders” ) deep into the surrounding gas. Although the plasma

parameters in streamers are diﬀerent from those in leaders, their propagation is associated

with the same physical processes and is deﬁned mainly by the parameters of the streamer

head. Since we are interested in the behavior of the streamer front only, we will not distin-

guish here between a streamer and a leader.

The streamer propagation mechanism was suggested by Raether, Loeb, and Meek [2]- [4],

and was further developed by other authors [5]- [7]. According to this theory the charged

head induces in its vicinity a strong electric ﬁeld. This ﬁeld leads to the increase of the

electron density ahead of the streamer front due to impact ionization . The charge is

displaced from this region via Maxwell relaxation. It is assumed that the free electron density

ahed of the streamer front is not zero due, e.g. to absorbtion of the streamer head radiation

produced, for example, by the streamer head radiation. The simple model which takes into

account only these main processes was considered by M.I. D’yakonov and V.Y. Kashrovskii

[8] [9]. They have estimated theoretically the streamer parameters and have shown that the

streamer velocity v0 and radius rs change smoothly with the external electric ﬁeld

−→
E , such

that the propagation of the streamer head can be treated as a quasistationary process.

In the present paper we generalize the streamer model [8] [9] to include an external mag-

netic ﬁeld. It is assumed that the plasma ﬁlaments propagate in a plane perpendicular to the

external magnetic ﬁeld and the streamer parameters do not change in the direction parallel

2

to the magnetic ﬁeld. It is shown that , in the weak magnetic ﬁeld limit, a quasistationary

streamer in the frame of reference rotating with a constant angular velocity ωs = v0/Rs ,

proportional to the head charge density, can be considered as a streamer in the absence of

the magnetic ﬁeld . We estimate the main parameters of a streamer head, and show that the

obtained value for the radius of curvature is in close agreement with experimental data [1].

The inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on the charge distribution within the streamer head is

discussed, and a critical magnetic ﬁeld for the onset of branching is estimated and compared

to the experimental data.

Since the energy relaxation time of electrons is much larger than the electron-ion relax-

ation time we ignore the gas heating processes. Thus the concentration of atoms changes

smoothly on the distance of the order of the streamer head size and is assumed to be con-

stant inside the head. We neglect also the ion drift velocity in comparison with electron

drift velocity vd and streamer velocity v0.

We assume for simplicity that the electron drift velocity is proportional to electric ﬁeld

k µikEk. Without external magnetic ﬁeld the mobility µik is a diagonal tensor,

(1)

(2)

µik = µ0δik. In a weak magnetic ﬁeld the mobility µik is a function of

−→
B , which can be

written as

µik =

µ0
1 + γ2 (δik + γεik) ,

where εik is the antisymmetric tensor in a plane perpendicular to

−→
B . The parameter γ =

ωBτea , where ωB = eB

mec is the cyclotron frequency and τea is the time of electron-atom

collisions, is assumed to be small, γ ≪ 1. In what follows we will be interested only in linear

corrections in γ to the solution of Eq. (1). Since the parameters α0, E0, and vd depend on

γ2 [11] they are magnetic ﬁeld independent, in our approximation.

Let us consider the streamer propagation equation (1) in the frame of reference with the

and ρs = e (N − ns) are the electron and the charge densities on the front.

Appearing in the ﬁrst order term with γ, the electric ﬁeld E0k is the ﬁeld of a streamer

propagating in the absence of external magnetic ﬁeld. It consists of two parts: the external

ﬁeld

where a = 2πρ (0), bkl - symmetrical matrix with Sp (b) = 0. The term E0k (0) +

l bklηl

corresponds to the potential ﬁeld, which satisﬁes the Laplace equation and can be absorbed

P

into Ek as a correction. The ﬁeld Dk, deﬁned by Eq.(9), is proportional to the deviation of

the charge distribution from the uniform one. It is small in the central region and becomes

large near the surface of the streamer head. Assuming that the streamer propagation is

determined mainly by the central region, one can discard the terms with

−→
D while determining

the streamer trajectory.

The second term in (9) leads to the streamer curving. At ω = −2πρ (0) γµ0 the equa-

tions (7) turn to a system of equations describing the quasistationary streamer propagation

without magnetic ﬁeld. Thus streamers moving from cathode or anode will curve in opposite

directions with frequency ωs = |ω| = |2πρ (0) γµ0|.

Introducing Maxwell relaxation time τ −1

m = 4πµ0ens, one obtains ωsτm = γρ(0)

2ens

. If the

streamer radius rs is of the same order of magnitude as the characteristic distance of the

increase of electric ﬁeld from internal region to the front, one can estimate rs as rs ≃ τmv0.

So we have

rs
Rs

=

γρ (0)
2ens

(10)

This value is very small, since γ ≪ 1 and ρ(0)
ens

∼ µEs

v0 ≪ 1. The last inequality can be

obtained from Eq.

(8) at ρ (0) ≃ ρs. Parameter γ is proportional to magnetic ﬁeld B,

so the streamer radius decreases as 1/B. This form of Rs (B) is somewhat diﬀerent from

the experimentally observed ﬁeld dependence reported in [1], i.e.Rs (B) ∼ 1/Bα, where

α ∼ 1.3 − 1.5. Such a disagreement is connected probably with the approximate description

of the ionization coeﬃcient and mobility by formulas (2), (3). It must be especially noticeable

at high magnetic ﬁeld.

To evaluate the streamer head charge we will consider the one dimensional streamer

equations (1). Such approximation holds if the width δ of the streamer front is much

smaller than the head size rs: δ ≪ rs. This is the case if the electron density in front of the

streamer is much smaller than inside [9]. Equations (1) at B = 0 have a simple analytical

solution. Assuming that the streamer moves along the x-axis and choosing the boundary

conditions as n (−∞) = n∞, E (−∞) = 0, and n (E = Es) = 0 we can easily obtain the

relation between the equilibrium electron density n∞ and the electric ﬁeld Es on the front

(11)

Here n0 = α0

4πe . This solution describes a plane wave with narrow front if µ0Es ≪ v0. In the

opposite case µ0E >> v0,one can neglect time derivatives in (1) and obtain the stationary

solution.

The equilibrium electron density n∞ and the propagation velocity v0 are deﬁned by

the conditions of the streamer formation. This stage of the discharge development should

be described by essentially nonstationary equations. Their solution depends on external

6

electric ﬁeld and parameters of initial ”seed”. On the quasistationary stage of the streamer

propagation the electron density n∞ can be estimated with the help of the relation

rs ≃

v0
4πeµ0ns

(12)

Here it is supposed that n∞ ≃ ns in agreement with ρ (0) ∼ ρs ≪ ens. Equation (8)

allows to relate the charge density ρs with Es. Note that Es and ρs/ens have logarithmic

dependence on the density ns and radius rs. Thus, the experimental error in rs gives rise to

small logarithmic correction to the relative charge ρs/ens.

Let us now compare our results with the experiment. For the streamer and plasma

parameters in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld we have used the data from the paper of

Dhali and Williams [12] for the streamer in N2 at atmosphere pressure: v0 = 2 · 108cm/s,

rs ≃ 10−2cm. Substituting these values to (11) and (12) one obtains ns ≃ 3 · 1013cm−3,

Es/E0 ≃ 0.6, ρs/ens ≃ µ0Es/v0 ≃ 0.2. Estimating γ = 0.04 at B = 1T we have from Eq.

(10) for the trajectory curvature radius Rs ≃ 0.5cm at B = 5T . The experimental value of

Rs [1] for the same conditions is slightly larger, i.e. Rex

s ≃ 1.2cm. This discrepancy can be

explained e.g. by the growth of the charge density from external region towards the streamer

front.

Let us consider the streamer in the limit of an inﬁnitely narrow front in the system of

reference where the streamer head is at rest . The electric ﬁeld E inside the head is suﬃciently

small so that the ionization process can be safely neglected. The ions are assumed not to

be aﬀected by the electromagnetic ﬁeld, i.e. N = const. The corresponding equations are

For simplicity the streamer body will be represented as a cylinder with radius rs and axis

directed along the ηx-axis. Writing the content of the square brackets in Eq.(13) by:

Thus, an electric ﬁeld E of the order of Es,in the ηx-direction at the streamer front stimu-

lates its propagation in this direction. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that a suﬃciently

strong electric ﬁeld component Eηy ∼ Es, perpendicular the streamer propagation, will lead

to the breakdown of the streamer head and the formation of a new streamer deﬂected along

the ηy-direction with respect to the original one. The new streamers will arise only from one

side in the plane transverse to

−→
B . Substituting ηx = 0, ηy = rs ≃ L0 in (21) we conclude

that the condition Eηy ∼ Es is fulﬁlled at γeγ ∼ 1, i.e. γ ≃ 0.6. This value for the atmo-

sphere discharge in N2 corresponds to B = 12T , which closely agree with the experimental

result Bex ≃ 7T [1].

In conclusion we have shown that the simple model taking into account only the main

processes provides a reasonably good description of the streamer discharge in a magnetic

ﬁeld. The streamer head propagation is very similar to the movement of a free charged

”particle”. Without magnetic ﬁeld this ”particle” moves with a constant velocity v0 = const.

In the presence of magnetic ﬁeld the trajectory has a circular form. Such a simple picture

occurs when the external electric ﬁeld E is negligible in comparison with the ﬁeld Es of the

charged streamer head. Nevertheless, the role of the external ﬁeld E is very important not

only for maintenance of the discharge, but also for the deﬁnition of the streamer parameters

on the initial stage of the development. Strong electric ﬁeld E ∼ E∫ ∼ E′ distorts the circular

trajectory making it similar to the trajectory of a charged particle in crossed electric and

magnetic ﬁelds. This phenomenon was observed in [1].

To estimate the ”particle” mass density ρm we compare the expression for the radius Rs

in the form Rs = ρmv0c

ρsB with Eq.(10). We obtain the following expression for the ratio of the

mass and the charge densities

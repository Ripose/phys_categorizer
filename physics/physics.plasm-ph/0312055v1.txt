We obtain, for the ﬁrst time, an analytic theory of the forward stimulated Brillouin scattering
instability of a spatially and temporally incoherent laser beam, that controls the transition between
statistical equilibrium and non-equilibrium (unstable) self-focusing regimes of beam propagation.
The stability boundary may be used as a comprehensive guide for inertial conﬁnement fusion designs.
Well into the stable regime, an analytic expression for the angular diﬀusion coeﬃcient is obtained,
which provides an essential correction to a geometric optic approximation for beam propagation.

PACS numbers: 42.65.Jx 52.38.Hb

Laser-plasma interaction has both fundamental inter-
est and is critical for future experiments on inertial con-
ﬁnement fusion (ICF) at the National Ignition Facility
(NIF)[1]. NIF’s plasma environment, in the indirect drive
approach to ICF, has hydrodynamic length and time
scales of roughly millimeters and 10 ns respectively, while
the laser beams that traverse the plasma, have a trans-
verse correlation length, lc, of a few microns, and coher-
ence time Tc of roughly a few ps. These microscopic ﬂuc-
tuations induce corresponding small-scale density ﬂuctu-
ations and one might naively expect that their eﬀect on
beam propagation to be diﬀusive provided self-focusing is
suppressed by small enough [2] Tc, Tc ≪ lc/cs, with cs the
speed of sound. However, we ﬁnd that there is a collec-
tive regime of the forward stimulated Brillouin scattering
[3] (FSBS) instability which couples the beam to trans-
versely propagating low frequency ion acoustic waves.
The instability has a ﬁnite intensity threshold even for
very small Tc and can cause strong non-equilibrium beam
propagation (self-focusing) as a result.

We present for the ﬁrst time, an analytic theory of
the FSBS threshold in the small Tc regime. In the sta-
ble regime, an analytic expression for the beam angular
diﬀusion coeﬃcient, D, is obtained to lowest order in
Tc, which is compared with simulation. D may be used
to account for the eﬀect of otherwise unresolved density
ﬂuctuations on beam propagation in a geometric optic
approximation. This would then be an alternative to a
wave propagation code [4], that must resolve the beam’s
correlation lengths and time, and therefore is not a prac-
tical tool for exploring the large parameter space of ICF
designs. Knowledge of this FSBS threshold may be used
as a comprehensive guide for ICF designs. The impor-
tant fundamental conclusion is, for this FSBS instability
regime, that even very small Tc may not prevent signif-
icant self-focusing. It places a previously unknown limit
in the large parameter space of ICF designs.

We assume that the beam’s spatial and temporal co-
herence are linked as in the induced spatial incoherence
[5] method, which gives a stochastic boundary condition
at z = 0 (z is the beam propagation direction ) for the

various Fourier transform components [6], ˆE, of the elec-
tric ﬁeld spatial-temporal envelope, E,

˜ν is an integral operator whose Fourier transform is νkcs,
where ν is the Landau damping coeﬃcient. E is in ther-
mal units deﬁned so that in equilibrium the standard
ρ = exp(−I0) − 1 is recovered. The physical validity of
Eqs. (3), (4) as a model of self-focusing in plasma has
been discussed before [8, 9, 10]. If ne/nc is taken con-
stant, there are 3 dimensionless parameters for ρ ≪ 1:
ν, ˜I0 ≡ (k0/km)2(ne/nc)I0/ν, and ˜Tc ≡ kmcsTc.

Since Eqn. (3) is linear in E, it may be decomposed, at
j Emj (x, z, t), where each
any z, into a ﬁnite sum, E =
term has a typical wavevector mj : Emj (x, z = 0, t) ∼

may be applied to general media with slow nonlinear re-

value for a particular k, as shown in ﬁgure 2. There is
no discernible diﬀerence in shape between |E(k, ω, z)|2

tions as in ﬁgure 4. A dimensionless diﬀusion coeﬃcient,
˜D ≡ (k0/k4

lare diﬀusion) may be extracted from the data of ﬁgure
4 by ﬁtting a smooth curve to hk2i for 5 < k2
mz/k0 < 76,
and evaluating its slope, extrapolated to z = 0. This
yields a diﬀusion coeﬃcient of 4.4E-04.

FIG. 3: A quasi-equilibrium is attained with one point E ﬂuc-
tuations remaining nearly Gaussian, as evidenced by the small
change in P5 [4], the fraction of power with intensity at least
5I0, but strongly modiﬁed I − ρ correlations. Parameters are
˜I0 ≃ 0.53, ν = 0.3 and ˜Tc ≃ 0.26. Each curve is normalized
to its value at z=0.

˜D may be compared to the solution of the stochastic
Schroedinger equation (SSE) [15] with a self-consistent
random potential [16], ρ, whose covariance, Cρρ (Cρρ is
a quadratic functional of F (k)) is evaluated as follows
[17]. Take E as given by Eqn. (3) with ρ set to 0 since
it goes to zero with ˜Tc, and use it in Eqn.
(4), with
ln(1 + ρ) → ρ, to evaluate Cρρ. This is consistent only
if ˜I0 < 1, so that the density responce is stable except at

small k/km. It follows, to leading order in ˜Tc, that the
SSE prediction for ˜D, for the top hat spectrum,

˜DSSE = ν ˜Tc ˜I 2

0 /68.8 . . . ,

(10)

has the value 3.2E-04 for the parameters of Fig. 4. Note
that ˜DSSE is proportional to hρ2i and the roughly 20%
increase of hρ2i over its perturbative evaluation (see ﬁg-
ure 3) used in the SSE accounts for about 1/2 of the
diﬀerence between ˜D and ˜DSSE.

We ﬁnd that ˜D depends essentially on the spectral
form, h| ˆE(k)|2i = F (k) , e.g., for Gaussian F (k) with the
same value of hk2i, DGaussain ≈ 3Dtop hat. A numerical
example of this dependence is found in ﬁgures 4 and 5.
˜D changes by 40% over 5 < k2
mz/k0 < 76, because F (k)
changes signiﬁcantly as seen in ﬁgure 5. In this sense,

Eqn. (10) implies that d/dz

FSBS growth length, then propagation, which eﬀectively
increases km, will reinforce this ordering. This stability
condition may be expressed as ˜D > ˜λmax, or qualitatively
as [18]

E

(cid:14)

This is a global condition, as opposed to the wavenumber
dependent threshold, kcutof f ( ˜I0). However, even if Eqn.
(11) is violated, it is not until kcutof f ≈ 1.5km, so that
the peak of the density ﬂuctuation spectrum is unstable,
that FSBS has a strong eﬀect. For these larger I0 values
a quasi-equilibrium is not attained, and it is more useful
to consider an integral measure, △(hk2i, z) ≡ hk2i(z) −
hk2i(0), of the change in beam angular divergence, rather
than the diﬀerential measure, D. △/ ˜I 2
0 is shown in Fig.
6, normalized to unity at ˜I0 = 0.61.

Note that we have not observed signiﬁcant departure
from Gaussian E ﬂuctuations for ˜I0 < 2 for the param-
eters of ﬁgure 6, which is consistent with the absence
of self-focusing. Therefore in this regime the eﬀect of
FSBS is benign, and perhaps useful for NIF design pur-
poses: correlation lengths decrease, at an accelerated
pace compared to SSE for ˜I0 ∼ 1, with z, while elec-
tric ﬁeld ﬂuctuations stay nearly Gaussian. As a result
[19], the intensity threshold for other instabilities (e.g.,
backscatter SBS) increases [20]. If ˜I0 > 4, there are large
non-Gaussian ﬂuctuations of E, which indicates strong
self-focusing.

In conclusion, well above the FSBS threshold we ob-
serve strong self-focusing eﬀects, while well below thresh-
old beam propagation is diﬀusive in angle with essential
corrections to geometric optics. In an intermediate range

4

of intensities the rate of angular diﬀusion increases with
propagation. In the weak and intermediate regimes, the
diﬀusion results in decreasing correlation lengths which
could be beneﬁcial for NIF.

Abstract

Radiation damping of the motion of charged particles in relativistic, optically thin plasmas is

described within the framework of the covariant gyrokinetic theory [1]. It involves description of

the collisionless single-particle dynamics as well as the Vlasov and Maxwell equations both written

in the covariant formulation. The damping causes corrections to the phase-space trajectory of

the particle, as well as to the form of the kinetic equation itself, due to the failure of conditions

of the Liouville theorem. Both eﬀects result independent of the gyrophase, which is retained as

an ignorable variable. In addition, the applicability range of the covariant gyrokinetic theory is

extended to describe short-wavelength perturbations with the background of zero parallel electric

ﬁeld. The presented theory is suitable for description of magnetized, relativistic, collisionless

plasmas in the context of astrophysical or laboratory problems. Non-uniquenes of the gyrokinetic

representation and consequences thereof are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Gyrokinetic description of hot magnetized plasmas[2] is an eﬀective tool that allows to

combine relative simplicity of the drift approximation with adequate account for the ﬁnite-

Larmor-radius (FLR) eﬀects, including description of short-wavelength perturbations. Cur-

rently, most applications are in the tokamak physics,[6, 9, 10, 18] where it is used for analysis

of transport, stability and turbulence. Earlier relativistic modiﬁcations of the theory[2, 5]

were designed for simulation of conﬁnement of fusion products. Meanwhile, the covariant,

four-dimensional formalism of the gyrokinetic (GK) theory, developed in our previous papers

[1, 13, 14], aims at being capable of describing fast ﬂows of matter, such as taking place in

accretion disks and relativistic jets in the realm of astrophysics. In particular, it is consistent

with the general relativity, permits the use of arbitrary four-dimensional coordinate systems

and non-canonical phase-space variables. Since four-dimensional formulation utilizes inter-

nal symmetries of electrodynamics, so that the applicability range of the gyrokinetic theory

extends even in its non-relativistic limit.

Four-dimensional representation of drift trajectories, and its relationship to symmetries of

the Faraday tensor were ﬁrst published by Fradkin.[16] On that basis, using the Lie-transform

methods, Boghosian[17] constructed the ﬁrst version of the covariant, four-dimensional gy-

rokinetic transformation. Still, that version was not covariant in the general-relativistic

sense, inherited several restrictions of the non-relativistic theories, and was too complicated

to be of practical use. Another formulation of covariant gyrokinetic theory was launched

by Beklemishev and Tessarotto[13] using a perturbative Lagrangian approach introduced

by Littlejohn.[7] The theory was just ﬁrst-order in the Larmor radius, but it was simple,

straightforward and fully covariant. An important point of that paper was concerned the

non-uniqueness of the gyrokinetic transformation, on which we are going to elaborate fur-

ther below. Additional work in this direction[1, 14] extended analysis to second order in the

Larmor radius and in the amplitude of the wave-ﬁeld, added explicit solutions for particle

trajectories, determined the covariant gyrokinetic equation, and the eﬀective source-term

for the Maxwell equations.

The covariant GK theory, published in [1] has two important limitations, which we aim

at amending in the present paper. The ﬁrst is typical to all existing gyrokinetic theories,

namely, their inability to account for cyclotron losses. The losses, while relatively small in

2

the non-relativistic limit, become signiﬁcant for relativistic particles.

In both cases they

destroy the most important integral of motion exploited by GK theories, the “magnetic mo-

ment”. The eﬀect, however, is diﬃcult to account for within the context of any Lagrangian

formulation, since it destroys the Hamiltonian nature of the system. Hence its inclusion in

the context of GK theory requires a speciﬁc treatment.

Radiation damping of the motion of a charged particle is a natural process described in

textbooks.[21] However, there is a question whether it can be directly applied for plasma

particles as is. Indeed, the eﬀect is resonant and deﬁnitely falls out of the scope of the theory

for cold dense plasmas, where the cyclotron emission is trapped and becomes a collective

process. This statement can be illustrated by the following example: a single particle moving

in a circle emits waves, while a steady circular current (or lots of particles moving in the same

circle) emits nothing. Well, the opposite limit is also realistic. In hot plasmas relativistic

eﬀects destroy the resonance, so that the radiation losses grow and lose coherence, i.e., occur

as if each particle is independent. This is the case we are going to explore: a hot rareﬁed

plasma, with a small optical depth in the cyclotron/synchrotron frequency range. The “small

optical depth” clause is included so that the radiation can escape, and the inverse processes

of scattering/absorption can be neglected.

In a hot rareﬁed plasma, the radiation damping causes corrections to the phase-space

trajectories of particles, as well as to the form of the kinetic equation itself, since the phase-

space volume is no longer conserved. We describe these eﬀects as small corrections, evalu-

ating them in the unperturbed gyrokinetic variables. Both eﬀects result independent of the

gyrophase, which thus can be retained as an ignorable variable.

The second limitation of the covariant GK theory developed in [1, 13, 14], which we

intend to overcome in this paper, is its inability to treat the short-wavelength perturbations

when the background parallel electric ﬁeld is zero. This eﬀectively limits description of typ-

ical plasmas in fusion devices, where the parallel electric ﬁeld is small, to long-wavelength

perturbations. In contrast, all alternative formulations of the gyrokinetic theory are appli-

cable only if the electric ﬁeld is small. By searching for the gyrokinetic transformation in

a broader class than before, we are able to derive an alternative formulation, which is valid

in all limits, i.e., both for small and for large (of the order of the magnetic ﬁeld) parallel

electric ﬁelds.

We also try to look at the problem of alternative formulations of the gyrokinetic theory

3

in broader context: is the gyrokinetic description unique? Are all alternative formulations

equivalent in some sense in their common applicability range? We intend to show that non-

equivalent descriptions are possible and still valid in certain orders of the perturbation theory.

This feature is not related to the Lagrangian approach but is common to all perturbative

methods.

Direct comparison of two non-equivalent gyrokinetic theories, in the common applicability

range, shows that even such basic feature as drift trajectories of the guiding center are

aﬀected by the choice of free parameters. Exploration of these degrees of freedom provides

new insight into the nature and applicability of gyrokinetic theories. For example, a closed

drift trajectory in one representation will not necessarily be closed in the other one. The

same applies for drift surfaces in magnetic traps as well. This feature is very important for

theoretical interpretation of cross-ﬁeld transport processes. Indeed, it follows that though

existence of closed drift surfaces means that particles are contained, the reverse is not true

- those closed surfaces might still exist in other representations of the drift variables.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we start by introducing necessary nota-

tions and deﬁnitions, and in Section III present the derivation of the covariant gyrokinetic

transformation, valid for all values of the electric ﬁeld, and the relevant equations of motion.

On this basis, in Section IV we discuss the uniqueness and convergence or the gyrokinetic

approximation. Next, in Section V, we describe the eﬀect of the radiation damping on the

motion of a particle in the gyrokinetic variables. In Section VI the covariant kinetic and

gyrokinetic equations are derived with due account for the radiation damping eﬀects. The

section also contains our proof of the Liouville theorem in Lagrangian variables, and explicit

expressions for the rate of contraction of the phase-space volume. Results are summarized

in Conclusion.

Throughout the paper the following notations are used: for four-dimensional vectors we

use bold letters, for tensor ﬁelds and operators use roman and calligraphic fonts. Normal

math letters are either scalars, or components of vector and tensor ﬁelds.

II. COORDINATES, THE TETRAD AND THE VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE

In order to carry out the program indicated in the introduction we ﬁrst introduce the

phase-space coordinates, and the tetrad of unit four-vectors linked to symmetry planes of

4

the Faraday tensor. In the covariant formulation the tetrad plays a role similar to magnetic

coordinates.

In these terms we formulate the variational principle for description of the

single particle dynamics. Finally, we introduce and discuss the template and the ordering,

which will be used later for construction of the gyrokinetic transformation of the phase-space

variables.

Covariance of the representation is deﬁned as follows: suppose we have arbitrary, user-

deﬁned coordinate system, of which we know the metric tensor, gµν, and the time-like

invariant interval ds is deﬁned as

where the Greek indices are assumed to go through µ, ν = 0, ..., 3. The signature of gµν

is assumed to be < 1+, 3

>, so that the zero coordinate is also time-like, and s is the

−

same as the “proper time”.The four-velocity u is then deﬁned in terms of its countervariant

components according to

As a result of (1), u is deﬁned as the unit 4-vector tangent to the trajectory. It is time-like,

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν,

uµ =

dxµ
ds

.

uµuµ = 1.

(1)

(2)

(3)

Thus, for an arbitrary coordinate system we have deﬁned the seven-dimensional phase-

space as (xµ, uν). If, then, we present an expression for a particle trajectory in this phase-

space, it will be covariant, i.e., valid in any coordinates. Section VI contains more informa-

tion about the phase space and distribution functions in it.

A. The basis tetrad

In the following we shall assume that in each point of space-time, x, there is deﬁned
a “tetrad”, i.e., an orthogonal basis of unit 4-vectors (τ, l, l′, l′′), such that the last three

4-vectors are space-like, and

ǫςλµντ ς lλl′µl′′ν = 1,

(4)

where ǫςλµν is the purely antisymmetric tensor. Orientation of the tetrad is arbitrary and

is deﬁned by 6 suﬃciently smooth scalar functions (3 pure space rotations and 3 space-

time rotations). The other 10 (out of 16 components of the tetrad vectors) fully describe

5

properties of the space-time itself. This feature is used in the so-called “tetrad formalism”

of general relativity [21]. It is important not to confuse this tetrad with the basis vectors of

the coordinate system.

A special choice of orientation links the tetrad (τ, l, l′, l′′) to the electromagnetic ﬁeld

tensor, Fµν. We shall refer to such basis choice as “ﬁeld-related”. Our subsequent use of the

tetrad makes other choices possible in the ﬁrst approximation,[13] but in higher orders just

the ﬁeld-related choice of orientation is compatible with the solution,[14] so we shall use it

from the beginning.

With the ﬁeld-related tetrad the (l′, l′′)-plane coincides with the space-like invariant plane

of the antisymmetric tensor Fµν, while (l, τ ) result belonging to its other invariant plane, so

that the Faraday tensor can be fully expressed as [14]

Fµν = H

(cid:1)
where H and E are scalar functions, having the physical meaning of the magnetic and electric

(cid:0)

ﬁelds in the reference frame where they are parallel. Thus, the ﬁeld-related basis orientation

is a generalization of the magnetic coordinates of the non-relativistic treatments. Fradkin[16]

ﬁrst used the invariant planes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor for decomposition of motion

of a charged particle.

The bivector combinations in the expression for Fµν, namely

bµν = l′

can be viewed as linear operators, which combine projection on an invariant plane with an

orthogonal turn in it. Then the Faraday tensor is

B. Variational principle and the ordering scheme

Particle dynamics in phase-space can be described on the basis of a variational

principle.[19] Of course, it is not unique, since diﬀerent functionals may have coinciding

extrema. One of the simplest-looking forms of such functional was used by Beklemishev

and Tessarotto[13] for description of particle dynamics in the seven-dimensional phase-space

in the framework of the general relativity. It allows to describe the particle trajectory in

the phase-space as a seven-dimensional extremal curve.

In the non-relativistic limit the

extra, seventh dimension is just time, and the whole representation can be easily reduced to

conventional terms.

The phase-space trajectory of a particle with the rest-mass ma and charge qa in prescribed

ﬁelds can be found from the variational principle δS = 0, as the extremal of the functional

S=

Qµdxµ =

(qAµ(xν) + uµ)dxµ,

(9)

Z

Z

where q = qa/mac2, and Aµ is the four-vector potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Ideally,

a variational principle in the phase space should yield the standard relativistic equation of

motion of the particle, plus the relationship between the velocity and displacement, (2).

As shown in [13], this is indeed the case for the functional (9), but only for variations of

uµ occurring on the hypersurface uµuµ = 1. In this sense the phase space is only seven-

dimensional. The above variational principle is independent of the parameterization of world

lines. Furthermore, the above variational principle, as any Lagrangian variational principle,

is gauge invariant, i.e., any change of the generating diﬀerential 1-form of the type

Qµdxµ

Qµdxµ + dF,

→

(10)

where F is an arbitrary smooth function of coordinates xµ and uν, does not change the

extremal curve.

In general terms one can deﬁne the gyrokinetic transformation as such transformation

of the phase-space variables, that one of the new variables, called the gyrophase, becomes

ignorable, i.e., the functional, when expressed in a suitable gauge, becomes independent of it.

Then, the canonically conjugate variable to the gyrophase, called the “magnetic moment”

or the “adiabatic invariant” depending on the context, is an integral of motion. As a

result, the motion of particles in the new gyrokinetic variables is simpliﬁed, since the system

7

is eﬀectively integrated in one degree of freedom, eliminating the highest characteristic

frequency. Once the transformation and equations of motion are found, it is possible to

simplify the kinetic description as well, i.e., ﬁnd the gyrokinetic equation (see Sect.VI).

Construction of the gyrokinetic transformation is done by way of expansion in powers

of formal small parameters ε and λ. They are introduced according to the “gyrokinetic”

ordering scheme , which in our case, following the notation of [6], is

Qµdxµ =

uµ + q(

Aµ(x) + λaµ(x/ε))

1
ε

{

dxµ,

}

so that ε accounts for the relative strength and inhomogeneity of the background ﬁeld, while

λ allows distinction between the large-scale background ﬁeld Aµ, and the wave-ﬁelds given

by aµ. In the ﬁnal expressions both parameters should be set to 1.

For an inﬁnitesimal Larmor radius, ε, λ

0, the particle trajectory is a very tight spiral,

which allows to represent the transformation as

→

s,p
X

xµ = x′µ +

εsλprµ

sp(yi),

uν = ¯uν + w (l′

ν cos φ + l′′

ν sin φ) ,

and

where

(¯uν, w) = (¯u′

ν, w′) +

εsλp (˜uν, ˜w)sp .

s,p
X

Here yi = (x′µ, φ, µ, uk) are the new gyrokinetic variables; x′µ being the coordinate of the
s (yi) describe the diﬀerence between
spiral center, the gyrocenter; the Larmor corrections rµ
the particle position and its gyrocenter, and are thus deﬁned to be purely oscillatory in

the gyrophase, φ; l′ and l′′ are the tetrad vectors deﬁning the “plane of rotation”, they

are assumed to vary on the scale of the background ﬁeld and depend on x′ only; ¯u′

ν is the
average part of velocity, w′ is its “perpendicular” component, while oscillatory corrections

to the velocity components describe the possibility that the velocity along the Larmor orbit

may behave in a complex fashion in higher orders.

The transformation (13),(14) should preserve the velocity as a unit vector. This require-

ment, expressed by Eq.(3), is satisﬁed if ¯uν is orthogonal to l′, l′′, i.e.,

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

¯uν = uoτν + uklν,

8

while parameters w, uk,uo satisfy

o = 1 + w2 + uk
u2

2,

(16)

which follows from uµuµ = 1 for all φ. Note that uo is not the 0th component of u.

There are just 6 independent corrections to be deﬁned in each order of the expansion. It

is possible to introduce the seventh free function by way of a correction to φ, but it is not

necessary. Thus, the gyrophase φ is deﬁned as an angle in the velocity-subspace, where we

introduced a cylindrical coordinate system linked to the Faraday tensor. This deﬁnition is

covariant with respect to transformations of the space-time coordinate system, which may

change the vector components, but not the vectors themselves.

As compared to our previous work,[14] the gyrokinetic transformation is being searched

for in broader class of transformations, (12)-(14), than before. Our previous formulation
left components of the velocity unperturbed, i.e., (˜uν, ˜w)sp ≡
simpler, but there was no solution in one particular limit in orders λi, i > 1. Without the

0. This made the whole work

wave-ﬁeld (λ0) solution existed for all parameters.

A more natural way of deﬁning the velocity transformation would be to keep ¯uν indepen-

dent of φ, i.e., discard Eq.(14), but allow the tetrad to ﬂex with respect to the background

ﬁeld tensor. Unfortunately, this involves too many variables, and is not realized at the

moment.

The ordering scheme should ensure that all components of the particle velocity are of the

same order despite the ordering of displacement, (12). This is achieved by ordering the dxµ

vector components in the new variables yi as

dxµ =

∂xµ
∂yi dyi = (dxµ)φ +

1
ε

∂xµ
∂φ

dφ.

Here (dxµ)φ means the diﬀerential of xµ with respect to all variables of the new set yi except
φ.

The ordering is designed to ensure that the expansion into the Taylor series in (xµ

x′µ),

i.e., in the Larmor radius, is possible for components of the background ﬁeld, Aµ, and the

orientation vectors, l′µ and l′′µ. Note, that we are going to expand the vector components

using partial derivatives, rather than vectors using covariant derivatives. Thus, we are going

to expand the scalar products of vector ﬁelds by basis vectors. For this to be possible, the

metric coeﬃcients, and, hence, the coordinate system and the curvature of the space-time

(17)

−

9

should be suﬃciently smooth, i.e., vary on scales larger than the Larmor radius. In contrast,

the wave-ﬁeld, aµ(x/ε), is allowed to vary rapidly, so that its Taylor expansion in (xµ

x′µ)

−

is impossible. Instead of the Taylor expansion the Fourier representation can be used for

aµ. Nevertheless, aµ can be still Taylor-expanded in powers of the displacement from the

“unperturbed” orbit. This displacement is proportional to the amplitude of the wave and is

required to be suitably smaller than the wavelength.

III. THE GYROKINETIC THEORY

The goal of the gyrokinetic transformation is to make φ the ignorable variable, and deter-

mine the corresponding integral of motion. We shall ﬁrst suppose that our general template

of the transformation, (12)-(17), satisﬁes the requirement, apply it to the variational prin-

ciple, and then determine the arbitrary functions of the template in such a way that the

Lagrangian is indeed independent of φ. The procedure will proceed order by order. Most of

the related algebra is already published,[1] so that we shall drop common expressions and

highlight diﬀerences in the process of derivation.

First we substitute expressions (12),(17) into (11) and drop terms of order ε2 or smaller,

assuming that uµ is of order zero, and expanding components of the vector potential into

the Taylor series. Then, following[13] we construct the gauge-modiﬁed functional

(cid:19)

where A′

µ = Aµ(x′ν). This gauge makes the expression more symmetric and converts all
references to partial derivatives of the vector potential into components of the Faraday

tensor at x′:

F µν =

As a result, δG′ becomes a long expression with terms proportional to dx′µ, (drµ

We proceed by eliminating from δG′ all terms oscillating in φ. This is done by solving for

displacements rµ

sp and the velocity corrections (˜uν, ˜w)sp in each order in ε and λ.

A. Order ε1

Initially we drop all terms in Eq.(20), which are of order ε1or higher, while retaining

contributions of order λ. Conditions for φ to be ignorable for the gauge-modiﬁed functional
δG′′ = δG′

¯y, where ¯y =

equation (22). This means that

˜uµ + λq˜aµ −

qrν

yields the only essential requirements. The physical meaning of Eq.(23) is the relationship

between the ﬁrst-order gyro-radius, r1, and the oscillating velocity, ˜u, along the Larmor

orbit. The time-like component describes changes in energy due to displacements of charge

in the electric ﬁeld.

If the above requirements (21) and (22) are satisﬁed and φ is ignorable, the hybrid

variational principle in our approximation can be expressed as δS′′ = 0 with

has only (l′, l′′)-components, and rλ(c)

We obviously do not need all components of ˜uµ and rλ

lution is not unique. Our previous choice was to set ˜u(c)

1 to satisfy these two equations. So-
µ to zero, which becomes incompatible

with equations for E = 0. Another possible choice, which is applicable for all regimes, is to
set rλ(c)

1 = 0. Note, that this choice is one among many with the same applicability, its main

advantage being just relative simplicity. Diﬀerent choices lead to non-equivalent gyrokinetic

transformations (see discussion in Section IV,) in particular, our current choice will make

the result diﬀerent from the previous formulation[1] even in the common applicability range.

The evaluation of the gyrophase averages involving the wave-ﬁeld aµ is, of course, the

diﬃcult part. The reason for this is the necessity to transform the given function of space-

time coordinates aµ(xν) into a function of new variables, while the transformation rule

D. Order ε1λ1

We proceed by considering the linear approximation in the wave-ﬁeld amplitude without

high-order curvature eﬀects. As noted above, the main problem here is the transformation

of the highly-local wave-ﬁeld aµ(x), where x is the particle position, to the guiding-center

coordinates (x′α, φ,

µ, uk). The Taylor-expansion procedure used above for transformation

of the equilibrium ﬁeld fails if the wavelength is suﬃciently short. Instead, Eq.(33) is solved

using Fourier analysis and expansion in powers of λ.

the third scalar equation (60) multiplied by duk, i.e. out of ﬁve equations for four unknown
functions dx′µ/duk only four are independent, as it should be for solvability. This allows to

determine the non-trivial solutions (at least formally) and use them as coeﬃcients of the

gyrokinetic equation.

orthogonal vectors of the basis (τ, l, l′, l′′). Taking scalar products with (l′, l′′) we get

in which case the previous formulation fails.

IV. EQUIVALENCE OF GYROKINETIC THEORIES

The gyrokinetic transformation is about ﬁnding and using the adiabatic invariant, which

corresponds to the fast Larmor rotation, and in the gyrokinetic limit becomes the ﬁrst

integral of motion. As such it splits the phase space into a sequence of hypersurfaces. The

invariant hypersurfaces should be the same for all gyrokinetic theories, unless they invoke

an additional ﬁrst integral (adiabatic invariant) of some sort. Thus, we conclude, that in

the same phase space the adiabatic invariants of diﬀerent gyrokinetic theories should be in

functional dependence. There is a catch, however. Indeed, the phase space of a canonical

theory is not gauge-invariant, since the canonical momenta depend on the gauge of the

electromagnetic ﬁeld. Thus, the adiabatic invariants with diﬀerent gauges can (and even

should) be diﬀerent. For a non-canonical Lagrangian theory the phase space is chosen in an

observable way, but this does not preclude similar ambiguity. Indeed, the gauge invariance

of the Lagrangian itself allows for diﬀerent expressions to appear.

There is another sort of ambiguity in terms related to division of the ﬁeld into the

“background” and the “wave” parts. The use of the two expansion parameters, ε and λ,

20

instead of a single one is due to convenience, rather than necessity. It is especially evident

in our covariant treatment, where all artiﬁcial restrictions on the wave-ﬁeld introduced in

conventional theories are removed. Indeed, both parameters are inversely proportional to the

background magnetic ﬁeld, and the two expansions can be eﬀectively replaced by a single one

by assuming that all nonuniformity of ﬁelds is due to eﬀective “waves”, i.e., by representing

the background ﬁeld via its Fourier expansion rather than its Taylor expansion. Obviously,

if the variation of the background ﬁeld is small on the Larmor scale, i.e., ε

1, then the

deviation from the unperturbed orbit will also be small, i.e., λ

1, and the applicability

≪

≪

of the wave-ﬁeld expansion for the variable part of the background ﬁeld is ensured. Unlike

the Taylor expansion, Fourier expansion is non-local, and as such has potentially better

convergence for ﬁnite values of the deviation. This is very important for the gyrokinetic

theory, which is used primarily for description of eﬀects due to the ﬁnite Larmor radius of

particles. Unfortunately, non-local theories are far less convenient from the mathematical

viewpoint.

The two ambiguities described above are more-or-less controlled by the user, so that they

can be counted among advantages rather than diﬃculties of the theory.

If the adiabatic

invariant is the only integral of motion, and the gyrophase is deﬁned as its canonically

conjugate angle variable, the freedom of variation becomes conﬁned to diﬀerent transforma-

tions within the subspace of the rest of the phase variables. This can be deﬁned as a class

of equivalence of diﬀerent gyrokinetic theories:

If, under the same gauge and the same division of the wave-ﬁeld, the adiabatic invariants

of two theories are in functional dependence, then the theories are “equivalent”,

i.e., the deﬁnitions of the gyrophase coincide, and all the diﬀerence is just in possible

transformations of the “drift” variables. As stressed above, theories should be equivalent if

there are no more integrals of motion that could be expressed via local parameters. (Global

integrals of motion are here irrelevant, if the derivation procedure is local as usual.)

The above argument holds for any particular power of expansion in ε. However, the deﬁni-

tion of the adiabatic invariant of order n may depend on the existence of other approximate

integrals of motion of order n, since any function of all integrals of motion is the integral

of motion and there is no formal means to distinguish between them. In particular, in the

ﬁrst order the electromagnetic ﬁeld is uniform, and in theories with slow drifts even the

electric ﬁeld is zero, so that there are at least two more integrals of motion, such as the

21

parallel velocity and the perpendicular gyrocenter position. As a result, in the ﬁrst order,

the deﬁnition of the “adiabatic invariant” is very slack, and besides the gauge, allows for

two more arbitrary functions to enter the deﬁnition. This fact is reﬂected in our paper,[13]

where it has been shown that the gyrokinetic transformation in the ﬁrst order is deﬁned

with six free parameters.

For higher-order theories this is dangerous, because by choosing one of the deﬁnitions

at an early stage, one can be left without any solution in the next order, where the other

approximate integrals of motion may disappear. Thus, the solubility condition for the second

order approximation removed all freedom from the deﬁnition of the adiabatic invariant in

our subsequent papers,[1, 14] (though left some in other respects.) Another possibility

is the survival of additional integral(s) of motion in the next order due to some ordering

or symmetry assumptions. For example, all previous (except [1, 14]) gyrokinetic theories

assume that the parallel electric ﬁeld and the background ﬁeld inhomogeneity are zero, and

the parallel wavelength of the perturbation is inﬁnite, while describing the eﬀect of the wave.

This means, that at least the parallel momentum of the particle is retained as an approximate

integral of motion in this order, and there is a possible ambiguity in the deﬁnition of the

“adiabatic invariant”. (Of course, nobody is so dumb as to insert the parallel momentum in

the deﬁnition by hand. Still, while using multi-step approximations, it is necessary to keep

the possible ambiguity in mind.) At the moment we do not know of any danger related to

this possibility, and it seems that, though the adiabatic invariant can be potentially deﬁned

in diﬀerent ways, it is impossible to say which one is “right”. Thus, the gyrokinetic theories

are potentially non-equivalent. In particular, diﬀerent choices of free parameters in Ref.[13]

lead to non-equivalent theories, when the corresponding deﬁnitions of the magnetic moment

are diﬀerent.

So, why is this “non-equivalence” important? The reason lies in the internal machinery of

the derivation. If the gyrokinetic transformations are non-equivalent, the deﬁnitions of the

gyrophase are diﬀerent, and, hence, so are the deﬁnitions of the gyrocenter/guiding center.

As a consequence, the “drift trajectories” in diﬀerent representations will diﬀer by a distance

of the order of the Larmor radius (

εn−1), depending on the gyrophase. Drift trajectories

×

are routinely used for conﬁnement analysis. If they form a drift surface, the conclusion is

that the conﬁnement is achieved. Now we see that this logic works in only one direction.

The reverse is not true: even if the drift trajectories form a surface in one representation, it

22

will not necessarily be the same one you are using!

If the gyrokinetic theories are not equivalent, they have close but essentially diﬀerent drift

trajectories.

V. CYCLOTRON DAMPING

A fundamental issue of for the kinetic description of relativistic magnetized plasmas is

the consistent treatment of cyclotron losses. In this section we describe the radiation losses

of a charged particle accelerated by an external electromagnetic ﬁeld as a single-particle

classical process. However, one should keep in mind that in cold, dense plasmas there

may be interference of cyclotron radiation from diﬀerent particles, thus modifying both the

outcoming radiation and its net eﬀect on the particle. In this limit the “cyclotron losses”

are better described by means of collision integrals and plasma waves.

Radiation damping of the motion of a particle in an electromagnetic ﬁeld is given by the

force [22]

Normally it should be a small correction to the electromagnetic force, but can also be large

for ultra-relativistic particles.

This expression can be translated to the covariant form by substitution of covariant

derivatives in place of d2ui/ds2 . Using the equations of motion, we get

D2ui
ds2 = q2FikF klul + q

Substituting it into the expression for the force, we can deduce the four-acceleration caused

Here the diﬀerentials ds can be identiﬁed with ds′, which was used in Section III for descrip-

tion of the gyrokinetic trajectory, due to identity (76). As a result, it is easy to “tweak” the

found in Section III and above, and are ready to use.

VI. KINETIC EQUATION

If equations of motion contain dissipative terms, i.e., the particle energy and momentum

are lost along the trajectory, the form of the kinetic equation itself may change.

It is

necessary to check the Liouville’s theorem, and introduce corrections if the phase volume is

not conserved.

25

First, let us deﬁne the phase space as a direct product of the space-time by the four-

velocity space. Note, that scalar products are deﬁned in each subspace, and between vectors

of diﬀerent subspaces, but not in the phase-space as a whole - you cannot add velocities to

distances. However, all trajectories or world-lines of particles, can be parameterized by the

proper time s, whose deﬁnition involves only the space-time subspace. In eﬀect, zero length

is ascribed to displacements in velocity directions.

Coordinates in the phase-space are introduced in accordance with existing scalar prod-

ucts. Namely, initially, for both subspaces we use the same systems of basis vectors, i.e., for

an 8-dimensional space we use two copies of four-dimensional basis vectors of space-time.

Consider a ﬂux-tube of trajectories. At a given point (x, u) it could be characterized

by the direction of its central line,(dx,Du)/ds, its cross-section, δV , and the ﬂux density,

f (x, u), which is identiﬁed as the distribution function of particles. However, the deﬁnitions

of the ﬂux density and the cross-section area are subject to the deﬁnition of the scalar

product, which is not fully deﬁned. Ascribing zero length to velocity displacements, as

in the standard parameterization, means that the direction of the central line is in eﬀect

(dx, Du)/ds

(u,0). Then the phase-space volume δV can be deﬁned as a product of the

→

volume element in the space-time, δVx, which is orthogonal to u, and the element of the total

velocity subspace, δVu, so that δV = δVxδVu. The volume element in the velocity space,
δVu, is also orthogonal to u, since the motion occurs on the hypersurface u2 = 1, which is

orthogonal to its radius, u.

The ﬂux of trajectories is continuous, i.e., the ﬂux lines do not end, if the particles do

not disappear. This means that f (x,u)δV = const, i.e.,

d (f (x,u)δV ) = 0,

which is a general form of the kinetic equation.

If, additionally, the Liouville’s theorem

holds, i.e.,

then the kinetic equation obtains its classic form,

Note, that the diﬀerential d takes place in the 7-dimensional phase-space, while the

volume element δV is 6-dimensional, as it describes an element of the hypersurface. Con-

sequently, f δV is the density of particles in their rest-frame in one particular moment.

dδV = 0,

df (x,u) = 0.

26

Deﬁned in this way, the phase-space volume and the distribution function coincide with

their non-relativistic analogs in the corresponding limit.

The full volume element in the space-time is δVσ = ǫαβγδδxα

Here δxβ

i is the β-component of the i-th box vector, and ǫαβγδ is the absolutely antisymmetric
tensor. Thus, the volume elements are scalars, so that if they are constant in one coordinate

system, they are constant in all others. In particular, we can choose the local co-moving

reference frame, in which uα = 0 and uα = 0 for all α

= 0 (this requires also gµ0 = 0). Then

δVx = ǫ0123u0δx1δx2δx3 = u0√

gδx1δx2δx3,

where the box sides are taken along the basis vectors. In words the invariant space subvolume

is deﬁned as follows: if there is a particle with velocity u, go into its rest frame, and put it

in a box. This is a unique way of measurement, i.e., a scalar.

The eﬀective volume element in the velocity-subspace we deﬁne as

Its deﬁnition is important for calculating moments of the distribution function, such as

the four-current density. We have deﬁned it as a scalar, i.e., an invariant under Lorentz

transformations, and it should coincide with corresponding deﬁnitions by other authors.

Indeed, in the co-moving frame it becomes

Here the box sides δxα, δuα are deﬁned along the corresponding basis vectors, i.e., are pure-

space coordinates and velocities.

The next question is how this box changes along the particle trajectory. To describe

it, ﬁrst note, that each direction in space, n, speciﬁes a rectangle cross-section of the box,

[xn, un]. Such cross-section is initially a rectangle, since the volume is deﬁned by a simple

product of the velocity and space boxes. Consider a small evolutionary change of the box,

and, hence, of the cross-section. The deformation of the rectangle is small and is due to

diﬀerent velocities (in x) and diﬀerent accelerations (in u) of particles. Since it is small we

can consider it linear, and as such it is a superposition of deformations proportional to uds

and to ads = Du.

Deformations due to perpendicular (to n) components of the velocity cause turns perpendic-

The acceleration-deformation, u′

n = un+ands, acts only in the un-direction, but can

change the area, since

Thus, the change of the area of the cross-section in each direction along the trajectory is

The change of the volume, δV, which can be represented as a product of areas of three

perpendicular cross-sections, is, obviously,

divua.

(88)

Note, that

•

due to the choice of the reference frame, the essence of the derivation is tree-

dimensional, i.e., it is valid in the nonrelativistic case as well;

28

•

•

•

•

the Lagrangian phase-space and the volume conservation law, (89), can be generalized

to multi-particle systems.

In this case the volume will be deﬁned as a product of

volumes for each particle, and the rate of change will be equal to the sum of rates for

each particle.

the resulting form can be easily transformed to the general reference frame by replacing

the three-dimensional divergence by its four-dimensional analog. Adding derivatives

in the direction of u cannot change the value, since a and u are always perpendicular

to each other. Thus,

dδV = δV ds

Divua.

·

(89)

the concept of the four-dimensional divergence is invariant with respect to changes

from ﬂat to curved space, and the eﬀect under description is just ﬁrst order. This

means, that even if we lost some generality along the way of derivation, expression

(89) should be valid in the curved space as well;

the divergence of acceleration with respect to velocity is very easy to ﬁnd, since the

metric tensor is independent of velocity. Indeed,

Divua=

∂aα
∂uα =

∂aα

(90)

•

the gravitational (a= 0) and electromagnetic (aα = qF αβuβ) forces always satisfy the
Liouville’s theorem, since F αβgβα = 0 due to antisymmetry of F αβ. Also, any force,

which is independent of velocity, satisﬁes dδV = 0 automatically.

The above list of cases, when dδV = 0, i.e., the phase-space volume is conserved, includes

all most often encountered cases of dynamical systems. Besides, it is still incomplete, but

also obviously not all-encompassing. In particular, forces due to the cyclotron damping for a

particle describing the gyrokinetic trajectory cause nonzero contraction of the phase-volume,

As expected, the phase-space volume of the system decreases due to emission of electro-

(cid:3)

magnetic waves. The rate of the decrease is constant for particles with non-relativistic

29

perpendicular velocities, w

0, but increases as w2 in the ultra-relativistic limit. The

kinetic equation for this case looks like

A. The gyrokinetic equation

At this moment we are ready to construct the gyrokinetic equation with due account for

the cyclotron losses. Starting from the kinetic equation for a dissipative system, (92), we

make a transformation to the gyrokinetic variables, (x′µ, uk,

µ, φ), in the phase-space. The

transformation rules are standard and result in

f ds = 0.

b

At this point we make an assumption that the motion is almost ideal, i.e., the cyclotron

emission can be described as a small perturbation, and its eﬀects can be calculated in zero

order in the Larmor radius expansion. As a result, we can deﬁne the perturbed trajectory

and the divergence term via equations (82) and (91). A nice common feature of these

expressions is that they are all independent of the gyrophase φ. This allows to reduce the

eﬀective number of variables in the following way.

All coeﬃcients of equation (93) are independent of φ, while the solution should be periodic

in it. If we represent the solution as a Fourier series, diﬀerent harmonics of the solution

will be completely independent. Assuming that all φ-dependent harmonics (m > 0) were

either absent initially, or disappeared due to the phase-mixing, it is possible to consider the

behavior of the φ-independent part (m = 0) alone. It satisﬁes, obviously,

∂f
∂x′µ dx′µ +

∂f

f ds = 0,

which is the gyrokinetic equation with due account for the cyclotron emission.

The “magnetic moment” is no longer an exact integral of motion, and is decreasing

with time. Note that the rate of decrease, and the emission-caused reduction of the phase

volume produce terms of the same order and are both equally important.

In contrast,

correction to the parallel acceleration seems small and unimportant as compared to its ideal

counterpart. It is certainly small, but in some cases describes important physical eﬀects.

For example, if the parallel momentum of the particle is conserved, the cyclotron damping

30

of the perpendicular component of the velocity should be accompanied by the increase of

its parallel velocity, since the relativistic mass of the particle decreases.

VII. THE MAXWELL EQUATIONS

In general, kinetic description of plasmas involves a combination of the kinetic equation

and the Maxwell equations, which describe the evolution of the collective electromagnetic

ﬁelds. The same is true for the gyrokinetic theory. However, since the gyrokinetic equation is

written in speciﬁc gyrokinetic variables, and thus yields the distribution function in terms of

these variables, a special procedure of integration in velocity space is necessary to calculate

the source terms of Maxwell equations. This procedure is presented below.

The general form of the Maxwell’s equations in presence of an arbitrary gravitational

ﬁeld is well known[21]. The second subset

which is the four-current density, expressed via the distribution function of particle species,

fα, the signed particle charge, qα and the element of the volume of the velocity-subspace,

δVu. Our current goal is to express fα (x, u) in terms of the gyrokinetic distribution function,
and uµδVu - in terms of the gyrokinetic variables.

Starting with δVu, we note that the four-velocity can be expressed via Eqs. (13)-(15) as

uµ = w

p

That is all we need in the λ = 0 limit, when the diﬀerentials in the expression (97) are

independent. In the presence of a wave, λ

= 0, the gyrokinetic variables are expressed in

terms of ¯w, ¯uk rather than w,uk. However, it is more convenient to w,uk as independent

Also, it is necessary to keep in mind that the components of the basis vectors, as well as

through the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor at the gyrocenter position, and thus should also be

Similarly, it is necessary to solve the equation (18) for rµ

2 in order to calculate the second-

order current density. The form of this equation (for λ = 0) is such that rν

2 may have

components proportional to trigonometric functions of φ and of 2φ. However, due to the

integration in φ, only the ﬁrst type of terms will produce a non-zero contribution to the

second-order current density. Thus, it is suﬃcient to solve for rν

21, which satisﬁes

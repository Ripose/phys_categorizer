Abstract

Nonlinear plasma oscillations in an arbitrary mass ratio cold plasma have

been studied using 1-D particle-in-cell simulation. In contrast to earlier work

for inﬁnitely massive ion plasmas it has been found that the oscillations phase

mix away at any amplitude and that the rate at which phase mixing occurs,

depends on the mass ratio ( ∆ = m−/m+ ) and the amplitude. A perturba-
tion theoretic calculation carried upto third order predicts that the normalized

phase mixing time ωp−tmix depends on the amplitude A and the mass ratio ∆
as ∼ [(A2/24)(∆/√1 + ∆)]−1/3. We have conﬁrmed this scaling in our simu-

lations and conclude that stable non-linear oscillations which never phase mix,

exist only for the ideal case with ∆ = 0.0 and A < 0.5. These cold plasma

results may have direct relevance to recent experiments on superintense laser

beam plasma interactions with applications to particle acceleration, fast ign-

itor concept etc.

The physics of the damping of nonlinear cold plasma oscillations is a topic of considerable

fundamental interest since it is the simplest nonlinear collective irreversible phenomenon

characterising the plasma state.

It also has wide applications to a number of problems

of current interest such as particle acceleration by wakeﬁelds and beat waves created by

intense lasers or particle beams, the fast ignitor concept in inertial fusion where relativisti-

cally intense coupled electromagnetic - plasma waves modes propagate deep into overdense

plasmas to create a ’hot spark’ and a number of other astrophysical / laboratory / device

based plasma experiments where intense plasma oscillations are generated. The conventional

thinking about the physics of this interaction is well illustrated by the exact solution for

nonlinear one - dimensional cold plasma ﬂuid equations with inﬁnitely massive ions. These

exact solutions may be obtained by transforming to Lagrangian coordinates as shown in

[1–3] or using stream functions [4]. The exact solution shows that coherent oscillations at

the plasma frequency ωp are maintained indeﬁnitely over the region of initial excitation,
provided the normalized amplitude of the initial density perturbation A(≡ δn
low 0.5. For A > 0.5, one expects and observes wave breaking and ﬁne scale mixing of

n ) is kept be-

various parts of the oscillation [1]. Mathematically, the electron number density blows up

at A = 0.5; this is because the Jacobian of transformation from Eulerian to Lagrangian

coordinates goes to zero as A → 0.5 and the transformation is no longer unique. Physically,
this is equivalent to crossing of electron trajectories which leads to multistream motions and

wave breaking as discussed in [1]. Studies of wave breaking and phase mixing damping are

based on numerical simulations.

The above description is adequate when the background positive species are inﬁnitely

massive ( m−

m+ ≡ ∆ → 0) and are uniformly distributed. If the background is inhomogeneous,
then as was shown by Dawson [1], cold plasma oscillations phase mix away in a time scale

π

2(dωp/dx)X , at arbitrarily low amplitudes. For a sinusoidal distribution of background

t ∼
species, such a phenomenon in the form of mode coupling of a long wavelength mode to

short wavelength modes was observed by Kaw et. al. [5]. They found that, the time scale in

2

which energy goes from long wavelength mode to short wavelength mode is t ∼ 2
’ǫ’ is the amplitude of the background inhomogeneity. The exact solution for the cold plasma

, where

ǫωp0

oscillations in a ﬁxed sinusoidal background was given by Infeld et. al. [6] who described

phase mixing in terms of electron density burst.

In this paper we show that the phenomenon of phase mixing will also occur in a homo-

geneous plasma at arbitrarily low amplitudes, provided the background positive species are

allowed to move (∆ 6= 0). This is because the background species respond to ponderomo-
tive forces either directly or through low frequency self-consistent ﬁelds and thereby acquire

inhomogenities in space. Such an eﬀect has been observed in electron positron plasmas

(∆ = 1) by Stewart [7]. In plasmas with ﬁnite temperature, it is well known that plasma

waves dig cavities by ponderomotive forces and get trapped in them; this is the physics of

strong turbulence of Langmuir waves as elucidated by Zakharov [8] and leads to envelope

soliton formation in one - dimension and collapse phenomenon in 2-D and 3-D. In a cold

plasma, stationary states cannot form even in 1-D because there is no thermal pressure eﬀect

to counterbalance the ponderomotive forces. The result is that the density cavities being

dug by plasma oscillations have an amplitude which increases secularly in time . Similarly,

the response of plasma oscillations to the presence of density cavities is also diﬀerent from

that of Zakharov problem. In the Zakharov problem, the thermally dispersive plasma waves

get trapped in density cavities forming localized wavepackets. Here, the inhomogeneity of

the cold plasma ( due to the self - consistently generated perturbation ) causes diﬀerent

parts of the plasma oscillation to oscillate at diﬀerent frequencies [1] [5] [6] resulting in in-

tense phase mixing of plasma oscillations. Thus we physically expect that if the background

species is allowed to move and get redistributed into inhomogeneous clumps of density, the

phase mixing damping of cold plasma oscillations should come in at any amplitude and is

not restricted to waves with A > 0.5. It may be emphasised here that for many applications

involving interaction of superintense laser beams with plasmas ( such as particle accleration

by wake ﬁelds, penetration into overdense plasmas etc. ) the cold plasma limit considered

by us is more relevant than the Zakharov description, because typically the plasma wave

3

intensities are such that | E |2 /4πnT ≫ 1.

In this paper we carry out particle simulations for elucidating the physics of phase mixing

damping of nonlinear cold plasma oscillations in an arbitrary mass ratio plasma (∆ arbi-

trary). We also present a perturbation - theoretic analysis to give a quantitative estimate of

the phase mixing time for moderate amplitude oscillations and compare it with simulation.

We start with the cold plasma equations viz. the continuity equations and the equations

of motion for the two species and the Poisson equation. We introduce new variables V, v, δnd

and δns deﬁned as V = v+ + v−, v = v+ − v−, δnd = δn+ − δn− = n+ − n− and δns =
δn+ + δn− = n+ + n− − 2 to write the cold plasma equations in the form

Note that we have used the normalizations: n± → n±/n0, x → kx, t → ωp−t, v± →

v±/ωp−k−1, E → E/(4πn0ek−1), with ω2
p−

= 4πn0e2/m− and ∆ = m−/m+.

Using n−(x, 0) = 1 + δ cos kx, n+(x, 0) = 1 and v±(x, 0) = 0, as initial conditions, the

solutions of the linearised equations are

The 2nd order solutions clearly exhibit generation of 2nd harmonic in space and time

as well as bunching of plasma particles in space. Both of these features are also evident in

the solution of Kaw et. al. [5] and Infeld et. al. [6]; but in contrast to their work, where

the background ion density was kept ﬁxed in time, here the density of the plasma particles
self - consistently changes with time as ∼ t2, as seen in the expression for δn(2)
of variation of plasma density with time, the phase mixing of an initial coherent oscillation

s . Because

happens much faster in this case. To make an estimate of the phase mixing time, consider

the charge density equation ( δnd in this case ). The equation for δnd correct upto third

order stands as

∂ttδnd + ω2

p[1 +

1
2

(δn(1)

s + δn(2)

s )]δnd ≈ 0

(16)

In the above equation, if we neglect the 2nd order term, then we essentially get the same

phase mixing time as in Ref. [5] modiﬁed by a factor which depends on ∆. Now taking only

5

the leading order secular terms from the expressions of δn(1)

s and δn(2)
s

( there are no secular

terms in δn(1)

∂ttδnd + ω2

p[1 +

(17)

Using the initial conditions δnd = A cos kx and ∂tδnd = 0 the WKB solution of the above

equation is

The above expression clearly shows that the energy which was initially in the primary

wave at mode k goes into higher and higher harmonics as time progresses. This can be

interpreted as damping of the primary wave due to mode coupling to higher and higher

modes. Microscopically, as the plasma particles oscillate at the local plasma frequency, they

gradually go out of phase and eventually the initial coherence is lost. Because of generation

of higher and higher harmonics with time, the charge density becomes more and more spiky

and as a result the electric ﬁeld gradients become more and more steep. This does not go

on indeﬁnitely. In reality, the density peaks get limited by thermal eﬀects with the Landau

damping of high k modes by resonant particles coming into picture. This process takes

energy from the high k modes and puts it on the particles, thereby raising their temperature,

which in turn limits the density peaks by exerting a pressure gradient. The time scale in

which the initial coherence is lost ( or the phase mixing time ) can be seen from equation

(18) as ωp−tmix scale as ∼ [A2∆/(24√1 + ∆)]−1/3.

It shows that only for the ideal case

∆ = 0.0 (inﬁnitely massive ions), phase mixing time is inﬁnity, i.e. the initial coherence is

maintained indeﬁnitely [2,3]. For an actual electron - ion plasma, ∆ although small, is ﬁnite

and hence plasma oscillations in it phase mix away at arbitrarily small amplitudes and in a

time scale dictated by the amplitude of the initial perturbation.

Now we present results from a 1-D particle-in-cell simulation which conﬁrms our scal-

ing of phase mixing time. For numerical simulation, we have used a 1-dimensional model

with periodic boundary conditions and have followed 5120 electrons and as many positively

6

charged particles ( the plasma taken as a whole is neutral ) in their own self - consistent

ﬁelds. The particles are initially at rest and the system is set into motion by giving a density

perturbation of the form n− = 1 + δ cos kx to the electrons. In the simulation, we follow the
time development of various modes of charge density (δnd). To compare with our theoretical

model, we rewrite equation (18) as

δnd =

){sin(2n + 1)kx + sin(2n − 1)kx}]
2

(19)

where α(t) = A2t3
24

∆√1+∆ . The amplitude of the ﬁrst fourier mode can be seen from the

above equation as

(20)

It is clear from equation (19), that upto the order of approximation considered, there

are no even number modes in the system. Fig. (1) show temporal variation of | δnd |n=1 for
∆ = 1.0 and A = 0.05. The dotted curve is the simulation result and the solid line shows

our expression (20) for the envelope of the oscillations. It is clear from the ﬁgure that our

approximate expression (20) captures the early evolution of the plasma quite well. Fig. (2)

shows the variation of τmix = ωptmix with ∆ for a ﬁxed A = 0.1 (curve(1)) and with A for a

ﬁxed ∆ = 0.01 (curve(2)). These curves clearly conﬁrm our formula for phase mixing time.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that nonlinear plasma oscillations in a cold ho-

mogeneous plasma, phase mix away at arbitrarily low amplitudes. This is because during

the course of motion the plasma particles respond to ponderomotive forces, acquiring in-

homogeneity and thereby making the plasma frequency a function of space. As a result,

electrons at diﬀerent locations oscillate with diﬀerent ( local ) plasma frequencies and the

imposed plasma wave losses coherence. The formation of density clumps can also be seen

from the Zakharov equations [8] for a warm electron - ion plasma. According to Zakharov,

the slow variation ( in the ion time scale ) of the background density in the presence of a
high frequency oscillation is governed by ∂ttδns − T ∂xxδns = ∂xx | E |2. In the limit when

7

the thermal term balances the ponderomotive force term ( i.e. δns

n0 ≈ −|E|2

T

), we get caviton

solutions in 1-D which are unstable to transverse perturbations. In the other limit, when

|E|2
T ≫ 1, it is the ∂ttδns term which dominates, and the Zakharov equation shows density
rising as ∼ t2. This is the same scaling as obtained by us using a perturbative approach. The
density inhomogenities thus created lead to phase mixing and collapse of cavitons. From

this we infer that a cold 1-D plasma exhibits a ’Langmuir collapse’ phenomenon similar to

what is seen in a warm plasma in 2 or 3 dimensions. The time scale of collapse is of the
order ∼ ( A2

role in the ﬁnal acceleration process ; similar physics is likely to be important in the fast

ignitor concept of laser fusion. We expect the processes discussed in the present paper to

play some role in such experiments. It should be noted that the simulation results presented

in this letter are non - relativistic. For many experimental situations the jitter velocity of

electrons is relativistic and we expect the mass ratio ∆ to be replaced by ∆ef f ≈ mef f /mi
where mef f /mi ≫ 1. Under these conditions, the phase mixing eﬀects considered by us
should become more important. Such investigations are in progress and will be presented

elsewhere.

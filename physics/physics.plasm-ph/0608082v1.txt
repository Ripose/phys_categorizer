Abstract

Laser interferometry is an extensively used diagnostic for plasma experiments. Existing plasma

interferometers are designed on the presumption that the scene and reference beam path lengths

have to be equal, a requirement that is costly in both the number of optical components and

the alignment complexity.

It is shown here that having equal path lengths is not necessary -

instead what is required is that the path length diﬀerence be an even multiple of the laser cavity

length. This assertion has been veriﬁed in a heterodyne laser interferometer that measures typical

line-average densities of ∼ 1021/m2 with an error of ∼ 1019/m2.

INTRODUCTION

Laser interferometry is an unambiguous diagnostic tool for measuring line-integrated

plasma density and so is extensively used. It is generally believed that the path lengths of

the scene and reference beams of the interferometer must be equal and this requirement has

been incorporated into existing interferometers[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. This leads to complicated

optics alignment procedures over long distances. The assumed reason for maintaining equal

path lengths of the scene and reference beams is to ensure coherent phases of the two beams.

The extent to which the phases of the beams are coherent is determined by the phase auto-

correlation function of the laser.

The purpose of this paper is to show that having equal path lengths is unnecessary. The

paper is organized as follows. Section II shows that the phase auto-correlation function, a

measure of the coherence, is a quasi-periodic function of the path length diﬀerence between

the two beams. The phase auto-correlation function peaks at path length diﬀerence δl =

0, ±2d, ±4d, ±6d, . . ., where d is the cavity length of the laser. Interferometer design can

be simpliﬁed by operating at a path length diﬀerence corresponding to one of these peaks.

Section III describes the setup of an interferometer being used on a spheromak formation

experiment at Caltech[7]. The interferometer uses a laser with a 25 cm cavity length and

operates at a path length diﬀerence of ∼ 8 m. Typical results from this interferometer are

presented in Section IV. Section V concludes the paper with a summary.

II. LASER PHASE AUTO-CORRELATION

A. Frequency spectrum of the laser

A gas laser contains an active medium within a resonating optical cavity bounded by

mirrors on either end. The mirrors allow only those optical modes which traverse an integer

number of half-wavelengths within the cavity. The frequencies of these optical modes are

νq = q

c
2d

q = 0, 1, 2 . . . ,

(1)

where c is the speed of light and d is the distance between the cavity mirrors. These discrete

frequencies are separated by νM = c/2d. For a typical He-Ne gas laser with a cavity length

of d ∼ 25 cm, the modes are separated by νM ∼ 600 MHz.

2

The active medium between the mirrors can be considered as a narrow-band optical

ampliﬁer. The gain curve for this ampliﬁer is centered around the frequency ν◦, such that

hν◦ is the energy released by the atomic transition that emits the photon. Only a few of

the discrete frequencies given by Eq.1 appear in the laser beam. These are the ampliﬁed

modes, the others are attenuated by the medium. For example, in a commercial red He-Ne

laser, photons are emitted because of transition of Ne atoms from a 2p55s state to 2p53p

state, which corresponds to a center frequency of ν◦ ∼ 473 THz. The gain curve is primarily

Doppler broadened[9] by an amount

∆ν ∼

ν◦
c r

2kT
M

,

(2)

where k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the gas temperature and M is the molecular mass of

the radiating atom. For a collection of Ne atoms emitting light at the He-Ne wavelength of

λ◦ = 632.8 nm at room temperature, the Doppler width is ∼ 2 GHz. Thus, an ampliﬁer with

gain width ∆ν ∼ 2 GHz allows about 4 modes separated by νM ∼ 600 MHz, as sketched in

Power will build up from noise in modes for which the gain exceeds the losses. As the

power in modes builds up, modes will saturate and equilibrate, so that the gain balances

the losses. Modes for which the losses exceed the gain are severely attenuated. For example,

if loss-line 1 in Fig.1 represents the losses in the system, a monochromatic wave will exist,

the one closest to the peak of the ampliﬁer gain function. On the other hand, if the losses

are represented by loss line 2, there will be 3 distinct modes in the wave. Power in various

modes is distributed according to the ampliﬁer gain proﬁle and losses in the system[10].

The wave electric ﬁeld in the polarization direction for an ideal laser can be represented

Fig.1.

−∞ Xq

˜Eqδ(ω − ωq)eiωtdω,

(3a)

(3b)

where ωq = 2πνq. Functions and variables in the frequency domain will be represented by

a “tilde.” Equation 3b is just a Fourier transform relation. Thus the Fourier transform of

the electric ﬁeld for an ideal laser is a series of delta functions, with the non-zero Fourier
coeﬃcients ˜Eq corresponding to the non-attenuated modes.

3

The discrete resonant frequency modes of a laser are each broadened by a small amount

δν, due to:

1. Losses due to absorption and scattering within the medium[9]. These losses relate to

the ﬁnite photon decay time via the uncertainty relation between time and frequency.

2. Imperfect reﬂection at the mirrors[9].

3. Vibration of mirrors[11]. If the mirrors vibrate by an amount δd, the corresponding

broadening of the modes is given by, δν ∼ ν◦δd/d.

In most commercial lasers, the frequency broadening thus produced is of the order of δν ∼ 1

MHz, as sketched in Fig.1. Typically, δν ≪ νM , and so the frequency-broadened modes do

not overlap each other.

The Fourier transform of the electric ﬁeld will now consist of a series of broadened func-

tions. Under the simplifying assumption that all the modes are broadened by the same

amount, the electric ﬁeld Fourier transform can be represented as

where ˜F (ω) is a low-pass broadening function of width 2πδν. Because the modes are well

separated, the spectral power is

B. Phase auto-correlation function related to power spectrum

The auto-correlation function of a laser is deﬁned as

G(τ ) =

hE∗(t)E(t + τ )i
h|E(t)|2i

.

The coherence time of a laser is deﬁned as the time τ at which the auto-correlation function

G(τ ) falls signiﬁcantly below 1 and the coherence length of a laser is the coherence time scaled

by c. It is traditionally assumed that if an interferometer is set up with path length diﬀerence

greater than the coherence length, the phases of the two waves will be uncorrelated, so no

interference pattern will be observed. However, this standard concept of coherence length is

4

(4)

(5)

(6)

misleading because the phase auto-correlation function is an almost periodic function; for the

purpose of interferometry, it is suﬃcient to maintain a path length diﬀerence corresponding

to a maximum of the auto-correlation function.

up constructively and so P(τ ) will be maximum at these values of τ . The exact shape of
P(τ ) will depend on the value of the coeﬃcients | ˜Eq|2. For a laser with large number of
modes (corresponding to many non-zero | ˜Eq|2’s), P(τ ) may have a steep decay away from

its peaks.

For a typical laser with d ∼ 25 cm and δν ∼ 1 MHz, P(τ ) will be periodic with period

1.67 ns and F (τ ) will have a spread of 1 µs.

It is convenient to scale time with c to

express P, F and G as functions of length. P(δL) is thus periodic with period 2d = 0.5

m and F (δL) decreases with a 300 m scale length. G(δL) is thus the product of a slowly

decaying envelope function F (δL) and a periodic function P(δL). The interferometer at

6

Caltech operates at δL ∼ 8 m corresponding to the 16th maximum of P(δL). We assume
F (δL) to be Gaussian ∼ e−(δL)2/2l2

, where l the width of F , is approximately 300 m. If

an interferometer is operated at a path length diﬀerence corresponding to a maximum of

P(δL), the strength of the interference signal will be proportional to F (δL). Thus for the

Caltech interferometer, operating at a path length diﬀerence of 8 m causes attenuation of

the signal amplitude by a factor F (δl = 8 m) = 0.9996. Or in other words, only 0.04% of

power is lost due to unequal path length eﬀects and phase coherence is maintained since

P(δl) has the same value at 8 m as at 0 m.

C. Measurement of laser phase auto-correlation function

To test if the laser being used in the Caltech interferometer indeed has a periodic auto-

correlation function, the laser was used in the Michelson interferometer setup shown in

Fig.2. Mirror M4’s location, L, was varied with a linear translation stage at a constant

speed and the amplitude of the interference signal was plotted as a function of time, as

shown in Fig.3. Interference is caused by ambient noise vibrating the mirrors. At t = 0

s, L was 0, and thus the path lengths were approximately equal. The amplitude of the

interference signal is directly proportional to the phase auto-correlation function. Since

L was increased at a constant rate, the horizontal time axis in Fig.3 is proportional to

the path length diﬀerence 2L. As seen from Fig.3, the phase auto-correlation function is

periodic. The diﬀerence between successive maxima corresponded to 2L ∼ 50 cm. The

amplitude decreased signiﬁcantly beyond the third maximum because the interferometer

became misaligned with large motions of the mirror. The minima of the amplitude of the

interference signal was of the order of the noise level of the detector.

III.

INTERFEROMETER SETUP

Figure 4 shows the schematic for the interferometer. RF electronics for demodulating the

signal is shown in Fig.5. Many interferometers, used on existing plasma experiments are two-

color interferometers[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14], that decouple the phase shift caused by the

plasma and by mechanical vibrations. Because mechanical vibrations are unimportant for

the fast time scales(∼ 10 µs) of the Caltech plasma experiment, a single laser interferometer

7

is adequate.

The interferometer described in Fig.4 is set up in a double pass geometry. By interfering

beams with large path length diﬀerence, it was possible to locate most of the optical compo-

nents on a small and accessible optical bench(18′′ ×18′′). Mirror M4 and the spherical mirror

SM are mounted on the vacuum chamber and direct the laser beam through the plasma and

back to the optical bench. The design uses a 4 mW linearly polarized He-Ne laser with a

cavity length of 25 cm. An optical isolator is placed in front of the laser to prevent any

reﬂected laser light from entering the laser. Half wave plate HWP1 rotates the polarization

vector of the laser beam so that it aligns with the direction of the polarizer at the input of

the isolator. Half wave plate HWP2 transforms the beam coming out of the isolator into

a vertically polarized beam. The polarization of the vertically polarized reference beam

is unaltered upon reﬂection from mirrors, beamsplitter or from transmission through the

acousto-optic modulator (AOM). Mirror M4 and the spherical mirror SM direct the beam

into the vacuum chamber through sapphire windows. Sapphire is a birefringent material,

and the windows are oriented to minimize the change in the polarization of the scene beam.

Note that the interference signal is maximized if the polarization of the interfering beams is

the same.

The AOM is oriented so that most of the power of the input reference beam is coupled

into the ﬁrst harmonic. Up to 86% of the input power can be coupled into the ﬁrst harmonic.

The iris obstructs all other beams except for the ﬁrst harmonic.

The radius of curvature of the spherical mirror is 4 m, the approximate distance the

beam travels from the optical table to the spherical mirror, so the spherical mirror focuses

the beam back to almost its original size. The spherical mirror position is adjusted to ensure

that the path length diﬀerence between the scene and reference beams is approximately an

even multiple of the laser cavity length. The path length diﬀerence is changed in steps of

∼ 15 cm. From Fig.3, it is observed that the laser phase auto-correlation function is ﬂat

around the maximas and thus precise adjustment of the path lengths is unnecessary. Once

the path length diﬀerence is maintained in the proximity of a maxima, the signal amplitude

of the interferometer was found to depend more on the alignment of the scene and reference

beams than on the precise path length diﬀerence of the two beams.

A major advantage of the design shown in Fig.4 is the ease of alignment. The two beams

are arranged to overlap each other simply by adjusting the cube beam splitter BS2, and

8

the mirror M2. Both these components are located on the optical bench and are easily

accessible. A cube beam splitter was used for combining the beams instead of a plate beam

splitter since a cube beam splitter does not introduce any lateral shift in the position of the

beam passing through.

IV. RESULTS

Figure 6 shows the demodulated quadrature signals from a typical plasma shot. Note

that when one of the signals is at its maximum or minimum, the other is passing through

zero - a consequence of being in quadrature. The random variation in the signal is due to

acoustic frequency mechanical vibrations. Plasma causes the sudden change in the signal as

indicated by the arrows.

The two signals shown in Fig.6 are plotted against each other in Fig.7. The data set

corresponding to plasma intercepting the laser beam is plotted as a solid red line while the

non-plasma times are plotted in blue dots. The extent to which the signals are in quadrature

can be estimated from the extent to which Fig.7 resembles a circle. Note that refractive

bending intensiﬁed the signal amplitude when the plasma intercepts the beam. Provided

that the beams undergo only a “small” displacement because of refractive bending, taking

the ratio of the two signals removes the eﬀects of refractive bending on the phase inferred[15].

Taking the inverse tangent of the ratio of the two quadrature signals yields the phase

change caused by the plasma. The plasma density shown in Fig.8 was estimated from the

phase change using

L

n(x)dx =

∆φp,

(18)

where ∆φp is the phase shift induced by the plasma, me is the mass of electron, ǫ◦ is the

permittivity of free space, e is the electron charge, L is the length of plasma the laser beam

traverses, and λ◦ = 632.8 nm is the He-Ne laser wavelength. From Fig.8 it is observed that

the mechanical vibrations have changed the phase by ∼ 30◦ in ∼ 50 µs, while the plasma

has induced a phase change of > 500◦ and back in ∼ 15 µs. Thus the mechanical vibrations

have negligible eﬀect on inferred plasma density, and can even be ﬁltered out during post

processing of data.

Line-densities of the order of 5 × 1021/m2 were observed in the experiment. Assuming a

9

double pass plasma length L ∼ 12 cm, as shown in Fig.9, corresponds to average densities

of ∼ 4 × 1022/m3. These results are in good agreement with the density inferred by ﬁtting

the Stark broadened Hβ(486.133 nm) spectral line proﬁle to a Lorentzian[16]. The signal

to noise performance of interferometers is speciﬁed in terms of the phase ambiguity of the

signals. The phase ambiguity is given by σ/A, where σ is the rms error in the signal and A

is the strength of the signal[17]. For typical data this was found to be ∼ 1◦, corresponding

to a line-density error of ∼ 1019/m2.

V. CONCLUSION

A He-Ne heterodyne interferometer was developed for the Caltech spheromak formation

experiment. The design is especially suited for fast plasma experiments with time scales

much smaller than the time scales of mechanical vibrations of the mirrors. The interferometer

operates well even though there is a path length diﬀerence of ∼ 8 m between the scene and

the reference beams. Operating at such a large path length diﬀerence considerably reduced

the number of optical components and diﬃculties in alignment.

The laser beams in a two-color interferometer may have diﬀerent periods for their phase

auto-correlation function. Thus operating at large path length diﬀerences in a two-color

interferometer may require some non-trivial modiﬁcations to existing setups. However, for

two-color interferometers with lasers having the same cavity length, or using a single laser[4],

the path length of the reference beam could be adjusted straightforwardly.

FIG. 9: (Color online) Image of the plasma from shot#7466, frame 16. The laser beam passes

through a plasma column approximately 6 cm in diameter. As the interferometer is designed in a

double pass geometry, the length of plasma, the laser beam traverses is L ∼ 12 cm.

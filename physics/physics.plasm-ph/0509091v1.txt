(Dated: February 2, 2008)

A Landau ﬂuid model for a collisionless electron-proton magnetized plasma, that accurately re-
produces the dispersion relation and the Landau damping rate of all the magnetohydrodynamic
waves, is presented. It is obtained by an accurate closure of the hydrodynamic hierarchy at the level
of the fourth order moments, based on linear kinetic theory. It retains non-gyrotropic corrections
to the pressure and heat ﬂux tensors up to the second order in the ratio between the considered
frequencies and the ion cyclotron frequency.

INTRODUCTION

In many spatial and astrophysical plasmas, collisions are negligible, making the usual magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) questionable. The presence of a strong ambient magnetic ﬁeld nevertheless ensures a collective behavior of
the plasma, making a hydrodynamic approach of the large-scale dynamics possible and even advantageous, compared
with purely kinetic descriptions provided by the Vlasov-Maxwell (VM) or the gyrokinetic equations. It is thus of
great interest, both for the numerical simulation of broad spectrum phenomena and for an easier interpretation of the
involved processes, to construct ﬂuid models that extend the MHD equations to collisionless situations by including
ﬁnite Larmor radius (FLR) corrections and Landau damping. In a ﬂuid formalism, FLR corrections refer to the part of
the pressure and heat ﬂux tensors associated with the deviation from gyrotropy. They play a role when the transverse
scales under consideration extend up to or beyond the ion Larmor radius (ﬂuid models are always limited to parallel
scales large compared with the ion Larmor radius). Evolving on a shorter time scale than the basic hydrodynamic
ﬁelds, FLR corrections can generally be computed perturbatively. This expansion cannot however be pushed arbitrary
far and any ﬂuid analysis addressing (transverse) scales comparable to the ion Larmor radius1 can only be heuristic.
From Vlasov equation it is easy to derive a set of exact moment equations. This ﬂuid hierarchy is however faced
with a closure problem. An interesting approach consists in closing this hierarchy by using relations, derived from
linearized kinetic theory, between given moments and lower order ones. This in particular accounts for linear Landau
damping in a ﬂuid formalism. Such an approach initiated in Ref.
[2] leads to descriptions usually referred to as
Landau ﬂuids. We here concentrate on a closure at the level of the fourth order moments, which provides an accurate
description of most of the usual hydrodynamic quantities.

An alternative method to the Landau ﬂuids is provided by the gyroﬂuids3,4 obtained by taking the moments of
gyrokinetic equations. The same closure problem is encountered for the moment hierarchy. The gyroﬂuids have
the advantage of retaining FLR corrections to all order relatively to the transverse scale within a low frequency
asymptotics but, being written in a local reference frame, the resulting equations are more complex than those
governing the Landau ﬂuids, we are here concerned with.

As an example, Landau ﬂuid models should be most useful to analyze the dynamics of the magnetosheath that
appears as a buﬀer between the earth bow shock and the magnetopause and plays an important role in decreasing
the impact of solar activity on the earth environment. Recent analyses of data provided by the Cluster spacecraft
mission have revealed that the magnetosheath displays a wide spectrum of low frequency modes (Alfv´en, slow and
fast magnetosonic, mirror)5 whose wavelengths extend down to the ion gyroradius and beyond. Since the plasma
is relatively warm and collisionless, Landau damping and FLR corrections are supposed to play an important role.
Coherent solitonic structures (magnetic holes and shocklets) are also observed, and their origin is still debated.6,7

A Landau ﬂuid model for collisionless purely magnetohydrodynamic regimes8 was ﬁrst derived from the equation for
the distribution function of the particle guiding centers, taken to lowest order. It is thus restricted to the largest MHD
scales where the pressure and heat ﬂux tensors for each species can be viewed as gyrotropic and where the transverse
velocity reduces to the electric drift. Starting directly from the VM equations, this model was then extended in order
to include a generalized Ohm’s law and to retain the leading order FLR corrections to the pressure tensor.9,10 This
model enabled one to reproduce the dynamics of dispersive Alfv´en waves propagating along the ambient ﬁeld both in
the linear and weakly-nonlinear regimes and to recover the kinetic derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger (KDNLS) equation
in a long-wave asymptotic expansion with, as the only diﬀerence, the replacement of the plasma response function
by its two or four poles Pad´e approximants.
It also accurately describes the dissipation of oblique magnetosonic
waves.11 Non-gyrotropic contributions to the heat ﬂuxes were introduced in Ref. [12] in order to obtain the dispersion
relation and the Landau damping rate of oblique and kinetic Alfv´en waves. The approach we present here provides

a more systematic description of the FLR corrections up to second order, by retaining parallel and transverse heat
ﬂux vectors whose coupling to the non-gyrotropic pressure contributions is in particular required for an accurate
description of the transverse magnetosonic waves.13 A recent paper by Ramos14 addresses a similar issue and derives
a complete set of nonlinear equations for ﬂuid moments up to the heat ﬂux vectors, leaving the closure on the fourth
order moments unspeciﬁed. We here follow a similar path choosing in Section II to linearize the equations for the
(“slaved”) non-gyrotropic contributions to the pressure and heat ﬂux tensors, while retaining nonlinear equations for
all the other moments. While Ramos performs a ﬁrst order expansion in the regime referred to as the fast dynamics
ordering, we here keep the second order accuracy necessary for a proper description of the oblique dynamics. By
ﬁtting with the kinetic theory brieﬂy reported in Section III, we also give in Section IV an explicit closure relation,
taking into account FLR corrections, and approximating the plasma response function with four and three poles Pad´e
approximants in order to recover accurate limits for Landau damping both in the isothermal and adiabatic regimes.
As the result of such a high order approximation, one of the fourth order moments is prescribed as the solution of a
dynamical equation. After a discussion of the resulting model in Section V, the validation of the model at the level
of the dispersion relation of the various MHD waves is addressed in Section VI. Section VII is the conclusion where
further extensions to a model, aimed at including a realistic description of the mirror modes, are announced.

II. FLUID DESCRIPTION OF EACH PARTICLE SPECIES

A. The moment hierarchy

Starting from the VM equations for the distribution function fr of the particles of species r with charge qr, mass mr,
and average number density nr, one easily derives a hierarchy of ﬂuid equations for the corresponding density ρr =

written as the sum of a gyrotropic pressure P = p⊥n + pkτ (with 2p⊥ = p : n and pk = p : τ ) and of a gyroviscous
stress Π = p that satisﬁes Π : n = 0 and Π : τ = 0.

We consider in this paper perturbations that are at large scale in all space directions and in time, with an amplitude
that is relatively small. This leads us to retain the terms involving the non-gyrotropic parts of the pressure and heat
ﬂux tensors at the linear level only. Such an ordering implies in particular that increasing the amplitude of the
ﬂuctuations requires longer length scales for preserving a given accuracy. In the following, we shall thus neglect the
σ contribution to the heat ﬂux tensor. One indeed easily checks from the equation satisﬁed by σ (see Appendix 2 of
Ref. [15]) that σ involves either nonlinear contributions or linear contributions of second order relatively to the scale
separation parameter, and thus turns out to be negligible in the equations for the gyroviscous stress or for the heat
ﬂuxes, at the order of the present analysis.

E. Dynamics of the heat ﬂux vectors

Equation (4) for the heat ﬂux tensor involves the divergence of the fourth order moment r, that at this step should
be simpliﬁed in order to conveniently close the hierarchy at the present order. We ﬁrst note that instead of dealing
with the fourth order moment r, it is convenient to isolate the deviation from the product of second order moments
by writing

ρrijkl = Pij Plk + PikPjl + PilPjk + Pij Πlk + PikΠjl + PilΠjk
+Πij Plk + ΠikPjl + ΠilPjk + ρ

rijkl.

rijkl a priori includes a contribution of the form Πij Πlk + ΠikΠjl + ΠilΠjk that we here neglect
The correction term ρ
since, as already mentioned, contributions from the gyroviscous stress are retained in linear terms only (except in Eqs.
(8) and (9) in order to ensure energy conservation). This algebraic transformation allows signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations
in the forthcoming equations. Second, we make the approximation of retaining only the gyrotropic part of the tensor
r that is then given by

F. Second order approximation of the non-gyrotropic pressures and heat ﬂuxes

Noting by inspection of Eqs. (31) and (32) that the magnitude of the transverse components of the heat ﬂux vectors
scales proportionally to the inverse gyrofrequency of the ions, we linearize the equations for these quantities, while
we retain the nonlinear dynamics of the longitudinal components (see Section II G). Using ∂l(

G. Simpliﬁed nonlinear equations for the longitudinal components of the heat ﬂux vectors

In deriving the dynamical equations governing the longitudinal components of the heat ﬂux vectors, we retain the
coupling to the transverse components and to the gyroviscous tensor at the linear level only, because of the presence
of a 1/Ω factor, and the assumption that the present equations are restricted to the description of the large scales.
We retain the other couplings that include quadratic contributions with respect to the ﬂuctuations (weak nonlinearity

V. COMMENTS ON THE RESULTING MODEL

The equations derived above for the ions are easily adapted to the electrons for which they greatly simplify when
1. This leads to neglect the non gyrotropic components of the corresponding
making the approximation me/mp ≪
pressure tensor. Note that the transverse components of the electron heat ﬂux vectors survive due to the contributions
of terms involving the product meΩe (see Section II.F). The system is to be supplemented by Faraday equation and
In this two-ﬂuid formulation, energy is conserved, as
Amp`ere’s law where the displacement current is neglected.
discussed by Ramos.14 It might nevertheless be advantageous to ﬁlter out the scales associated with electrostatic
waves by prescribing quasi-neutrality, replacing the electron momentum equation by a generalized Ohm’s law, and
turning to a one-ﬂuid description. Numerical simulations of a monoﬂuid model obtained from a simpliﬁed version of
the present model have shown that energy is in practice very well conserved.10

When compared with the previous model12 designed to reproduce the oblique Alfv´en wave dynamics, the present
approach proves to be more systematic and, as discussed below, allows one to accurately simulate all dispersive MHD
waves, including oblique and transverse magnetosonic waves (see Section VI). The previous model has on the other
hand the advantage of including a nonlinear description of the gyroviscous tensor. It is of interest to see how, when
linearized and restricted to the case of the Alfv´en wave scaling (also neglecting the gyroviscous tensor contribution),
the equations governing the gyrotropic heat ﬂuxes in the present model compare with those of the previous one. It
turns out that Ref.
[12] unfortunately includes a few algebraic errors originating from a sign error leading to an
incorrect factor 3 in Eq. (C.8), a missing multiplicative factor mp/mr in the r.h.s. of Eqs. (C.9) and (C.10) and a
missing minus sign in front of the ﬁrst occurrence of Ωp/Ωr in Eq. (C.12). This in particular aﬀects the equations
for the gyrotropic heat ﬂuxes where the contribution v2
∆e in the r.h.s. of Eq. (56) should be suppressed, the square
bracket in Eq. (66) replaced by [v2
1)
A and the factor 3 in the last term in the r.h.s.
−
of Eq. (67) also discarded. After correcting these errors and taking into account that pressure and heat ﬂux tensors
were computed using barycentric velocities, one easily checks that the parallel heat ﬂux equation is exactly recovered
and that the equations for the perpendicular heat ﬂux of both models identify in the isothermal limit where the time
derivatives are negligible. This limitation originates from the insuﬃcient order of the Pad´e approximant used in the
previous model.

VI. MHD WAVE DYNAMICS

When restricted to a one or quasi one-dimensional dynamics along the ambient ﬁeld, only the longitudinal compo-
nents of the parallel and transverse heat ﬂux vectors (that correspond to the gyrotropic contributions to the heat ﬂux
tensor) arise in the equations of motion. A long-wave reductive perturbative expansion performed on the resulting
Landau-ﬂuid model reproduces the kinetic derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation derived from the VM equations
for Alfv´en waves with a typical length scale large compared with the ion Larmor radius,17 up to the replacement of the
plasma response function by appropriate Pad´e approximants. As a consequence, the modulational type instabilities
(including ﬁlamentation18) of Alfv´en waves and their weakly nonlinear developments are correctly reproduced.9 Nu-
merical simulations of such regimes are presented in Ref. [10] where a study of the decay instability is also presented
and validated by comparison with hybrid simulations.19

As stressed in Ref. [13], the correct determination of the dispersion relation for transversally propagating magne-
tosonic waves requires a detailed description of non-gyrotropic contributions to the pressure and heat ﬂux tensors.
When restricted to a purely transverse dynamics, the present model reduces to the ﬂuid model used in Ref. [13] that
exactly reproduces the large-scale kinetic theory (note that a factor 3/2 is missing in front of the z-term in ǫxy given
in Eq. (2.8) of the latter reference).

The present model easily reproduces the dispersion relation for kinetic Alfv´en waves (KAW) for which the crucial
ingredient is the contribution to the transverse velocity originating from the time derivative of the leading order
gyroviscous stress [last term in Eq. (39)].12,20,21 Whereas these KAWs are also captured by a low frequency expansion
of the kinetic equations,22,23 this is not the case for oblique Alfv´en waves. The reason is that an expansion at order
ω/Ω includes contributions of order k2
L when kz/k⊥ scales like k⊥rL as for KAWs, but only includes terms of order
k⊥rL for ﬁnite angles of propagation. The same limitation holds for the gyrokinetic formalism. The present ﬂuid
formalism however allows one to obtain the correct linear dynamics for oblique Alfv´en waves, as was shown in Ref.
[21], using a Landau ﬂuid model actually contained in the present one.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

11

We have constructed a Landau ﬂuid model that reproduces all large-scale dispersive MHD waves in a warm colli-
sionless plasma. This model may be most useful not only for numerical simulations involving a broad range of scales,
but also for analytic purposes, such as the computation of secondary instabilities. An example is provided by the
ﬁlamentation instability of parallel propagating Alfv´en waves. This mechanism may be relevant in the understanding
of the evolution of Alfv´en waves in magnetospheric plasmas that often display very ﬁlamentary structures.24 The
present model allows one to account for linear Landau damping, dominant FLR corrections as well as drift velocities,
that play an important role in these plasmas whose equilibrium state often involves a large scale longitudinal current.
The importance of nonlinear kinetic eﬀects such as particle trapping that are here neglected should be estimated by
comparison with fully kinetic simulations.

In a suﬃciently anisotropic plasma, the mirror instability can develop, whose threshold is accurately reproduced by
the present ﬂuid model.8,10 A diﬃculty nevertheless originates in that, for large-scale mirror modes, the growth rate of
perturbations propagating in the most unstable direction scales like the transverse wave number of the perturbation,
which makes the smallest scales retained in a large-scale simulation to be the most unstable. The instability actually
reaches a maximal rate at a scale comparable to the ion Larmor radius and is arrested at smaller scales, under the eﬀect
of FLR corrections.25 Small transverse scales are thus to be retained. A promising approach consists in expressing, at
the level of the linear kinetic theory, non-gyrotropic contributions in a closed form suitable for being incorporated into
ﬂuid equations. Explicit reference to the plasma response function should in particular be eliminated. A model that
reproduces the arrest of the mirror instability and that is simple enough to permit accurate numerical simulations
will be presented in a forthcoming paper.26

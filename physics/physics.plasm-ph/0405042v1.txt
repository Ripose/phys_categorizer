We report on a numerical observation of the train of zeptosecond pulses produced by reﬂection
of a relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulse from the oscillating boundary of an overdense
plasma because of the Doppler eﬀect. These pulses promise to become a unique experimental and
technological tool since their length is of the order of the Bohr radius and the intensity is extremely
high ∝ 1019 W/cm2. We present the physical mechanism, analytical theory, and direct particle-in-
cell simulations. We show that the harmonic spectrum is universal: the intensity of nth harmonic
scales as 1/np for n < 4γ2, where γ is the largest γ–factor of the electron ﬂuid boundary, p = 3 and
p = 5/2 for the broadband and quasimonochromatic laser pulses respectively.

Recent impressive progress in the physics of attosecond
X-ray pulses [1] triggers a fascinating question whether
a range of even shorter pulses is achievable with the
contemporary or just coming experimental technology.
In the present work, we show that when an ultra-
1020W/cm−2
relativistically intense laser pulse, Iλ2
µm2, is incident onto a plasma-vacuum boundary, the
reﬂected radiation naturally contains subattosecond, or
zeptosecond (zepto= 10−21) pulses.

The idea of harmonic generation via reﬂection from
a laser-driven oscillating plasma boundary was ﬁrst pro-
posed a few years ago and has been studied in several the-
oretical articles [2, 3, 4]. Numerous experimental works
[5, 6, 7] and simulations [8, 9] were devoted to the laser in-
teractions with overdense plasmas and the high-harmonic
generation. Plaja et al[3] were the ﬁrst to realize that the
simple concept of an oscillating plasma mirror gives an
opportunity to produce extremely short pulses. In a re-
cent work, Naumova et al[4] have made a revolutionary
step in this direction since they have proven that a single
attosecond pulse can be isolated when a laser pulse fo-
cused down to the λ3 volume is reﬂected from a plasma
surface.

The emphasis of our work is diﬀerent. We concentrate
on the very basic physics of the high harmonic genera-
tion and discover the spectrum universality as well as its
scaling. These features have been overseen in the earlier
publications. The central result of our present work is
the universal power-law harmonics spectrum decaying as
1/np. The exponent p = 5/2 for a quasi-monocromatic
and p = 3 for a broad band incident laser pulse. This
power-law spectrum runs up to a critical harmonic num-
max, where an exponential cut-oﬀ sets in.
ber nc ∝
Here γmax is the largest relativistic factor of the plasma
boundary.
It is the slow power-law decay, that allows
for the subattosecond pulses. We compare the analytic
theory with direct particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations.

Let us consider a monochromatic laser wave with
the dimensionless vector potential eAi(t, x)/mc2 =
Re [a0 exp(
iωx/c)]. This wave is reﬂected by a
sharp plasma surface positioned at X(t′) at the time t′.

First of all, we must decide what boundary conditions
should be used. We are interested in reﬂection from the

The “ideal mirror” boundary condition implies zero
tangential components of the vector potential at the mir-
ror surface. As a consequence, when the ideal mirror
moves with γ
1 toward a laser pulse with the elec-
≫
tric ﬁeld El and duration τ , then the reﬂected pulse ac-
γ2El and the duration
quires the electric ﬁeld Ereﬂ ∝
τ /γ2. Consequently, the energy of the reﬂected
τreﬂ ∝
pulse must be γ2 times higher than that of the incident
one. However, as the plasma surface is driven by the
same laser pulse, this scaling is energetically prohibited,
and the plasma cannot serve as an “ideal mirror”. In-
deed, the ideal mirror must support a surface current
factor. A realistic
Jm ∝
plasma surface does not provide such a current and the
boundary condition must be changed.

The same boundary condition was postulated ad hoc by

properties of the reﬂected radiation.

is the retardation relation. The ﬁne structure of the
spectrum of F (t) depends on a particular surface motion
X(t), which is deﬁned by complex laser–plasma inter-
actions at the plasma surface. The previous theoretical
works on high order harmonic generation from plasma
surfaces [2, 3] tried to approximate the function X(t).

It appears, however, that a universal spectrum scal-
ing can be obtained without an exact knowledge of the
function X(t). Being interested in universal results we
discard calculating X(t) and this makes our approach
very diﬀerent from the previous ones. We only sup-
pose for a moment that the boundary motion is pe-
riodic X(t + π/ω) = X(t). Later we consider non-
monochromatic laser pulses and get rid even of this re-
striction. First, we mention that the Fourier spectrum of
F (t) can be represented in the form:

ˆFn = A0ω

i( ˆSn+1 −

ˆCn+1 + ˆCn−1 −

where ˆCn and ˆSn are the n
th harmonics of C(t) =
cos (2ωt′) and S(t) = sin (2ωt′), and t′ is the retarded
time (5). We examine only the spectrum of C(t), because
that of S(t) can be worked out analogously.

It is easy to see that the function C(t) has a period

monics. Introducing the new variable τ = 2t we obtain

To calculate the spectrum (7) we use the saddle point
technique. The saddle points τn are obtained from the
equations dΦ1(τn)/dτ = 0 and dΦ2(τn)/dτ = 0. The
ﬁrst equation reduces to dΦr(τn)/dτ = n/2

where T (τ ) = (1/2ω) arccos C(τ /2), Tn = T (τn) and

physical meaning. The reﬂected radiation frequency is
multiplied by the factor 4γ2 because of the relativistic
Doppler eﬀect, where γ is the relativistic factor of the
plasma surface.
If the plasma surface oscillates non-
1, then Eq. (8) has no real
relativistically, so that γ
solutions for n > 1, and the spectrum of C(t) exponen-
tially decays. When γ
1, there is a real solution for
any n < nc = 4γ2

the second saddle-point equation has no real solutions.

When one considers the physical mechanism of high-
harmonic generation as presented in Fig. 1, it becomes
evident that the harmonics are emitted in the form of
subattosecond pulses.
Indeed, all harmonics above a
number n < nc are generated at times between T (−)
and T (+)
n . From Eqs. (5), (8) the subattosecond pulse

estimation tells us that the reﬂected pulse can be made
very short by applying a ﬁlter selecting harmonics with
high numbers larger than n.

The mechanism presented in Fig. 1 has another very
interesting consequence. Each harmonic is generated
due to the saddle points corresponding to the proper γ–
factor. These saddle points come into (9) with diﬀerent
phase multipliers. Fig. 1b represents the case of a more
fac-
complicated plasma surface motion, when the γ
tor has several maxima, “humps”, per half-laser period.
Yet, one can see that the saddle points are grouped, i.e.
there is a couple of the saddle points on every ”hump”.

The phase shift between the contributions of the sad-
dle points T (±)
n,i belonging to the the same ith ”hump” is
not very large. For example, for the saddle points T (±)
this phase shift equals Φ(n) =
nc/n. The

frequency modulation period due to their interference is

(6πg/5√nc)n3/2. This

inteference really brings modulation to the spectrum only
6πg/(5ω). On the other side, the phase shift
if √nc ≫
between the contributions from diﬀerent ”humps” can
be much larger. This means that a non–trivial motion
of the critical surface producing more than one γ–factor
”hump” per oscillation period is the cause of the spec-
trum modulation. This conclusion supports the explana-
tion of the modulation proposed by Watts et al[7] and
agrees with the experimental observations by Teubner
et al[6] and Watts et al[7]. Finally, we notice that the
larger number of the saddle points does not change the
averaged value for d2
t Φ(tn) and, consequently, does not
aﬀect the overall spectrum scaling.

A careful analysis reveals that the intensity spectrum
1/n5/2 is valid for a monochromatic incident wave
∝
only. Indeed, if the laser pulse is short and has a spec-
tral bandwidth ∆ω, then the spectral scaling fails at
frequencies Ω > ω2/∆ω. At these frequencies, the re-
ﬂected radiation is broadband and contains no distin-
guishable harmonics. To examine the ﬁnite bandwidth
inﬂuence we represent the incident wave as Ei(t, x) =

To check our analytical results, we have done a number

which roughly corresponds to the solid hydrogen or liquid

changes into the exponential decay increases for higher

Let us take a close look at the particular case a0 = 20
(the red line in Fig. 2). In this case, the power-law spec-
trum extends above the harmonic number 2000, and zep-
tosecond pulses can be generated. As one sees from the
electron distribution function f (t, x, px), Fig. 3, the max-
imum surface γ

6. The temporal proﬁle of the reﬂected radiation
t
is shown in Fig. 4. When no spectral ﬁlter is applied,
Fig. 4a, a train of attosecond pulses is observed [3]. How-
ever, when we apply a spectral ﬁlter selecting harmonics
above n = 300, a train of much shorter pulses is recov-
ered, Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c zooms to one of these pulses. Its
full width at half maximum is about 300 zs. At the same
time its intensity normalized to the laser frequency is
huge (eEzs/mcω)2

The presented theory and simulations are 1d, i.e., in a
planar geometry. This assumes that the laser focal spot
radius r
λ. Recent 2d and 3d PIC simulations in
the λ3 regime [4] have shown that the multi-dimensional
eﬀects may help, particularly, to isolate a single (sub-
)attosecond pulse.

In conclusion, the reﬂection from ultrarelativistically
moving plasma boundaries forms two diﬀerent universal
spectra because of the relativistic Doppler eﬀect: 1/n5/2
for an incident quasimonochromatic wave and 1/n3 for
a broadband pulse. The slow power law decay of the
high harmonic spectrum causes high intensity zeptosec-
ond pulses. The observed pulse duration of 300 zs corre-
sponds to the spatial pulse extent comparable to the ﬁrst
Bohr orbit. As a result, the special relativity theory in-
trodicing the relativistic Doppler eﬀect may open a new
page of applied ultrafast laser spectroscopy.

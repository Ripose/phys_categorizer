Test particle calculations have been performed of classical electron trajectories in the combined
ﬁeld of an ion and a homogeneous, high frequency laser ﬁeld. By taking ensemble averages with
respect to initial conditions, inverse bremsstrahlung heating rates are found and are compared with
several known analytical and numerical results. The role of stochastic electron trajectories at high
laser intensities which involve multiple collisions and large angle scattering events is examined in
the calculations of the heating rates. These are important for anisotropic electron distribution
functions, such as those produced by photoionization and are statistically negligible in the case of
plasmas described by isotropic electron distribution functions. The critical role played by short
range cut-oﬀs in determining electron scattering cross sections is also addressed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The description of electron-ion (e-i) collisions in presence of a strong oscillatory electric ﬁeld has been an essential
part of every laser plasma interaction model. Collisional absorption, inverse Bremsstrahlung (IB) heating and trans-
port processes rely on a correct expression for the e-i collision frequency. Advances in laser technology, particularly
those related to the generation of ultra short laser pulses and progress in inertial conﬁnement fusion studies have chal-
lenged our understanding of collisional processes over a wide range of conditions and plasma parameters. Recently,
Fraiman et al. have published a series of papers [1] identifying a population of electrons in phase space that experience
multiple interactions with ions resulting in large angle scattering and anomalously high heating rates. However the
role of these correlated collisions in overall heating rate which depends on the electron distribution function has yet
to be quantiﬁed. In this paper we summarize the known results for energy exchange due to IB and compare these
with numerical test particle calculations. We also examine the statistical importance of stochastic electron orbits on
the average heating rates and on the kinetic modeling of laser produced plasmas.

Plasma evolution in the presence of high frequency electric ﬁelds has been investigated for about forty years starting
with pioneering works by Dawson and Oberman [2] and Silin [3]. In addition to kinetic theories, analytical descriptions
of IB heating published during this time period can be roughly divided into two groups: ”ﬁrst principle” quantum
mechanical calculations [4,5] and classical mechanics approximations, cf. e.g. [4,6,7]. All theories consider the two
body scattering problem as a starting point. Essentially they all calculate the IB heating rate involving only small
angle scatterings and weak momentum transfer. Only recently, numerical studies of electron scattering on ions in
presence of a high-frequency ﬁeld [1,8] have revealed a new physics of stochastic electron trajectories and correlated
collisions, which may result in large momentum exchange. The statistical weight of these correlated collisions on the
average heating rates remains undetermined.

The Dawson-Oberman (DO) model [2,9–11] of the electron-ion correlation function is based on the classical Born
approximation of binary collisions and on an explicit average over random ion positions. The Coulomb ﬁeld of immobile
ions is considered as a weak perturbation to the electron motion with drift velocity v0 along a straight trajectory
together with an oscillation in the laser ﬁeld with a quiver velocity vE. The DO collision operator describes e-i
scattering as an instantaneous event resulting in a small angle deﬂection of the electron trajectory. The IB heating
rate has been found in the weak ﬁeld limit [2] or for an arbitrary strength of the oscillating ﬁeld [10] with a Maxwellian
distributions of electrons [2,10] or with arbitrary distribution functions [9,11]. Derivations by Pert [9] and Shvets and
Fish [11] arrive at DO-like expressions starting from the test particle, two body scattering problem. An useful review
of high ﬁeld eﬀects on the IB heating rates has been published by Vick et al. [12].

Silin [3] has developed a kinetic model of IB heating independent from the DO work. He has calculated the high
frequency nonlinear conductivity and the eﬀective collisional frequency for a fully ionized plasma which is in close
agreement with the DO model [10] in both limits of weak and strong high frequency ﬁelds.

1

Several classical descriptions of the eﬀective collisional frequency have been derived from the dynamics of Ruther-
ford electron scattering assuming instantaneous and elastic interactions [4,6,7]. They are identiﬁed as the classical
approximation [4], the impact approximation [6], or more recently, the ballistic model [7]. From the energy conserva-
tion for such collisions one ﬁnds that the change in the average electron kinetic energy, which is related to electron
drift velocity, is proportional to the change in the electron momentum. Therefore the heating rate can be calculated
in terms of the transport cross section. Finding an expression for the IB heating rate also involves an average with
respect to the phase of the laser ﬁeld at the time of the e-i collision. A similar result for the IB heating rate can be
obtained from the solution to the electron kinetic equation with a Landau collision operator after averaging the result
with respect to the high frequency oscillations [13].

The Rutherford cross section in the classical Coulomb ﬁeld scattering problem leads to a logarithmic divergence,
accounted for by the so-called Coulomb logarithm in the collision frequency. At large distances, the cut-oﬀ length
appears naturally in kinetic theory due to plasma screening eﬀects as shown in the Balescu-Guernsey-Lenard theory
of particle collisions [14]. Similarly, a large amplitude high frequency ﬁeld introduces another cut-oﬀ in the collision
operator at large impact parameters [2,3]. However, there is no such limitation at short distances within the framework
of classical mechanics. This has to be introduced explicitly by using quantum mechanical or statistical arguments.
This is a particularly important point in the classical description because the correlated large angle collisions become
important for small impact parameters, as discovered in recent studies [1,8].

Implicit in all previous treatments of e-i collisions in presence of a high frequency ﬁeld is so-called ”low frequency”
approximation which considers particle collision as an instantaneous event. Quantum descriptions of e-i collisions in
a laser ﬁeld employing the low frequency approximation have been developed by Kroll and Watson (KW) [5] and by
Bunkin and Fedorov who applied the Born approximation with respect to the Coulomb ﬁeld [4]. Agreement between
the quantum mechanical and the classical derivations of the electron heating rate has been demonstrated by Ferrante
et al. [16]. They found that the quasi-classical, or eikonal approximation leads in a straightforward manner to the KW
formula. This agreement between quantum mechanical calculations and classical orbit integrations will be further
demonstrated in our numerical studies.

It is important to recognize that this similarity between quantum and classical mechanical approaches includes an
appropriate cut-oﬀ value for classical interactions at short distances. For example, the KW expression in the limit
of a weak oscillatory ﬁeld contains a Coulomb logarithm with the de Broglie wavelength as the short distance limit.
This approximation applies to fast electrons with energies higher then the atomic binding energy. Such a cut-oﬀ must
be introduced into the classical calculations of the IB heating rate as an additional condition. For electrons with
smaller energies (comparable with the atomic binding energy), free-bound transistions must be taken into account.
This further complicates the physics of e-i collisions [15].

Analytical IB heating rates have been averaged with respect to the Maxwellian velocity distribution function [17]
showing good agreement between classical and quantum results. However no expressions are available for the scattering
cross section of single electron in a laser ﬁeld and for the IB heating rate for an arbitrary electron distributions.

The common feature of theories cited above is that they all involve assumptions of a small scattering angle,
instantaneous collisions and they ignore events with small impact parameters. They fail to describe correlation
eﬀects, complicated electron trajectories and large angle scattering. These eﬀects have been studied numerically [1,8]
and it was found that they can dominate heating rates for electrons with small drift velocities v0
vE that are
launched in parallel with the electric ﬁeld direction. However the statistical weight of these so-called ”representative”
electrons [1], depends on the electron distribution function. Our analysis shows that the correlation processes might
become important for the averaged IB heating of electrons with a strongly anisotropic velocity distribution, such as
that produced in photoinized plasma [18]. In contrast, they are not statistically important in isotropic plasmas.

≤

In Section II we discuss various analytical expressions for the IB heating rate and describe our numerical model.
Section III is devoted to calculations of energy exchange rates between the laser ﬁeld and monoenergetic electron
beams. Heating rates for strongly anisotropic and isotropic electron distribution functions are also derived. The
conclusions are presented in Sec. IV.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE ENERGY EXCHANGE IN THE LASER FIELD

In the introduction, we identiﬁed three groups of analytical results describing e-i collisions in the presence of a
homogeneous oscillating electric ﬁeld. The ﬁrst group involves ”ﬁrst principle” quantum mechanical calculations
[4,5]. The second group includes the seminal work by Dawson and Oberman [2] and papers which develop a kinetic
description of the plasma based on approximations to the two body correlation function [10,11]. Finally, works from
the third group modify the classical mechanical Rutherford scattering problem to allow for electron oscillations in the
laser ﬁeld [4,6,7]. All these studies are restricted to small angle collisions which involve small momentum exchange.

2

The three categories are rather broad and are not necessarily clearly separable. For example, we have included in
the second category of kinetic studies the Ref. [11] which starts with a test particle formulation and after averaging
leads to heating rates similar to those of Refs. [2,10]. Our three groups include all known to us analytical results for
e-i collision rates and prove to be a convenient characterization for various formalisms that are used to calculate the
heating rate for electrons of a given initial energy. In fact, as we will see below, all theories lead to remarkably similar
heating rates particularly for energetic electrons and small angle collisions, where electron scattering is well described
by the Born approximation. Distinct from the analytical studies are numerical calculations of particle trajectories
and cross sections, in particular, the recent publications by Fraiman et al. [1].

A. Energy absorption rate – quantum and classical treatments

In this section we summarize analytical expressions for the rate of energy exchange between a single electron and

a linearly polarized laser ﬁeld E = E0 cos ωt due to e-i scattering in the nonrelativistic approximation.

Quantum mechanical calculations [4,17] describe the energy exchange rate between an electron and a laser ﬁeld by

using the KW cross sections [5] for e-i scattering. The result is given by

e, m and v0 are the electron charge, mass and the initial drift velocity, and lmin = 1/ξ is the maximum number of
emitted photons. Energy exchange in this equation is expressed in terms of the diﬀerences between the total absorption
cross section (the terms with l > 0 in the sum) and emission (the terms with l < 0) of l photons.

The Dawson-Oberman approach is based on the classical Born approximation for the description of e-i collisions
and only takes into account small angle scattering. The IB heating rate for a given electron has the following form

investigations and we consider simpliﬁed expressions that result for the special cases described below.

Classical theory results from studies by Pert [6] and Bunkin [4] are based on the instantaneous collision approxi-
mation and are averaged with respect to the laser ﬁeld period. The heating rate is given by the following expression:

Our simulations of nonrelativistic electron scattering in the ﬁeld of an ion with a charge Ze and in the presence
of a uniform laser ﬁeld are similar to the studies by Fraiman et al. [1]. However, in order to account for the physics
which is outside the classical formulation of the test particle problem, we introduce an eﬀective potential U (r) [20]

which has cut-oﬀs both at large and small distances.
It corresponds to the screened Coulomb potential at large
distances and thus it accounts for plasma polarization eﬀects. At short distances, it accounts for quantum diﬀraction

To show diﬀerences between the eﬀective potential (5) and the bare Coulomb potential 1/r, we present both functions
in Fig. 1 together with characteristic distances which can limit the model (6) applicability. The de Broglie wavelength
λB is calculated at the quiver velocity amplitude vE corresponding to a laser intensity of 1016 W/cm2 and a wavelength
of 0.25 µm.

Numerical solutions of Eq. (6) require special attention regarding the choice of a suitable time step in the com-
putation of electron orbits near the Coulomb scattering center. We have used the symplectic integration algorithm
[21], which ensures good accuracy. Even though the test particle problem described by Eq. (6) appears simple, the
construction of the statistical ensemble of results for a broad range of initial conditions for the averaging of heating
rates poses considerable challenges in terms of computer memory and time requirements.

The IB heating rate for a single electron has been calculated directly from the simulation results according to the

following equation:

where v0 and v′
0 are the electron drift velocities before and after a collision, angular brackets denote an averaging
over the ﬁeld phases and ρ is the impact parameter. The drift velocity of an electron is deﬁned as the diﬀerence
between the total electron velocity and the quiver velocity (see Fig. 2 for details). The electron heating rate due to
IB absorption (7) is compared below with known analytical and numerical results.

The dependence of the e-i scattering problem on the laser frequency ω, the electric ﬁeld amplitude and the initial
kinetic energy of an electron can be characterized in terms of two dimensionless parameters Ω = ω(eE3/Zm2)1/4 and
v0/vE [1]. The ratio of the initial drift velocity to the quiver velocity amplitude, v0/vE, characterizes every IB theory,
including quantum and classical analytical studies. The second parameter, Ω deﬁnes the argument in the Coulomb
logarithm in the classical limit, where the short distance cut-oﬀ involves the impact parameter for 90◦ scattering,
0/2Ze2ω = (v0/vE)3Ω4/2. However, for the quantum cut-oﬀ, a new parameter appears which is
bmax/bmin = mv3
bmax/bmin = mv2

2/ξ.

Correlation eﬀects which give rise to enhanced heating rates are due to the fast oscillation of electrons in the laser
ﬁeld. They bring an electron close to the ion many times as it crosses an interaction region. These eﬀects are most
pronounced at low drift velocities. For a drift velocity smaller than the quiver velocity, v0/vE = Ωv0 < 1, the electron
trajectory becomes irregular [8] and it cannot be approximated by a straight path in the calculations of the collision
cross-section.

looses its energy due to emission of photons. This can be readily seen from the classical formula (3). For v0
vE the
heating rates become positive and increases at ﬁrst with decreasing electron drift velocity. Figure 3 clearly displays
large discrepancies between the various approximations at v0
vE regime of velocities in the parallel
launch geometry contains the so-called ”representative” electrons of Ref. [1]. These are particles which undergo
multiple scattering and follow complicated trajectories in the combined electric ﬁeld of the scattering center and the
high-frequency radiation. None of the analytical approaches can properly describe such interactions. The classical
mechanical models rely on the assumptions of instantaneous collisions and small momentum exchange. Quantum
results also fail to describe large angle scattering events. Two of the heating rates shown in Fig. 3 are obtained from
numerical simulations: the black dots represent calculations for the bare Coulomb potential and follow the Fraiman
et al. [1] results. The solid curve has been obtained by using the eﬀective potential (5) with the de Broglie cut-oﬀ
calculated at the initial electron drift velocity v0. These results involve an averaging with respect to phases of the
oscillatory ﬁeld.

scattering cross section behaves as
ions at very close distances, which should be cut-oﬀ due to quantum eﬀects. Elimination of such close encounters
through the introduction of the eﬀective Coulomb potential U (5) leads to much slower growth of the heating rate
(solid line in Fig. 3).

The calculations based on the classical mechanical formulation require a short distance cut-oﬀ in order to, at least
approximately, account for quantum eﬀects. All analytical theories in Fig. 3 contain such a limitation, which results
in the saturation of the heating rates at low drift velocities. The quantum KW theory (dot-dash curve) does not lead
to a divergence. For small oscillatory ﬁelds KW theory produces a natural cut-oﬀ at λB(v0) in the logarithmic term.
However, its usefulness at low velocities in deﬁning the proper quantum cut-oﬀ or the eﬀective potential is limited as
the theory fails to account for large momentum scattering events. The eﬀects of electron capture and bound states
are also absent from these calculations. For the parallel launch geometry of Fig. 3 an uncertainty in the choice of
the quantum cut-oﬀ limits the validity of classical mechanical simulations, particularly because the results are very
sensitive to the cut-oﬀ value.

Figure 4 examines another polarization of the initial electron velocity, which is now directed transversely to the
direction of the oscillating ﬁeld. In that case the heating rate is always positive. As in the case of a parallel launch,
the heating rate increases for small electron drift velocities. However, it does not display any of the previous rapid
vE. Numerical simulations with the eﬀective potential U (5) result
changes or unique behavior in the vicinity of v0
in the reduction of the heating rate (solid line) as compared to the KW or the classical analytical model. We have
also examined the electron phase space, ﬁnding no random trajectories or ”representative” electrons undergoing large
angle collisions.

B. IB heating rate for non-Maxwellian anisotropic electron velocity distribution function

Studies of monoenergetic electron scattering conﬁrms the sensitivity of the heating rates to the relative orientation
of the initial velocity and the electric ﬁeld, as well as to details of the cut-oﬀ distance for short range interactions.
The parallel launch geometry gives rise to random electron trajectories, multiple collisions and a large momentum
exchange, all of which lead to an enhancement of the heating rate. The magnitude of this increase for typical conditions
found in laser-produced plasmas depends on the number of slow electrons and the anisotropy of the actual electron
distribution function. Plasma produced by high intensity ultrashort laser pulses, if dominated by the multiphoton
ionization [18]are characterized by anisotropic electron distribution functions. This can potentially lead to many large
angle collisions resulting in an enhancement of the IB heating rates.

The velocity distribution function of photoelectrons is dependent on atomic and laser parameters. It displays a
strong anisotropy along the direction of the linearly polarized laser beam [18,23]. The following simple analytical
expression captures the main features of electrons produced by the multiphoton ionization process [23]:

We compare results of various analytical models and numerical simulations after averaging with respect to the
electron distribution function (11). This averaging reduces to a simple integration of heating rate expressions in the
parallel geometry (8) and (9) with a one-dimensional Maxwellian velocity distribution. The main contribution to
this integral comes from slow electrons. In this region, all classical theories give diﬀerent results that are strongly
dependent on the cut-oﬀ parameters as has been shown above. For the quantum approach, the IB heating rate per
electron as derived from Eq. (8) has the following form:

Figure 5 represents the intensity dependence of the IB heating rates, that are obtained from our numerical model
and from various analytical expressions we derived by using the single electron energy exchange rates averaged over an
anisotropic distribution function (11). A relatively large discrepancy between various models follows from diﬀerences
already shown in Fig. 3. An enhancement of the heating rate and a sensitivity to the cut-oﬀ values is characteristic
for the parallel launch geometry. It is evident that the correlated collisions signiﬁcantly enhance the heating rate at
large intensities. The anisotropy of the electron distribution is responsible for such an eﬀect. This fact is illustrated
by comparison with the heating rate calculated for the three-dimensional Maxwellian (isotropic) distribution function

FM = ne(m/2πTe)3/2 exp

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

with the same temperature, Te = Tef f . In this case, the heating rate is reduced and displays a monotonic dependence

Photoinoized plasmas with a non-Maxwellian distribution of electrons is a another case where large angle collisions

can lead to enhanced IB heating rates. More work needs to be done in comparing these models with experiments.

C. IB heating rate for an isotropic electron distribution

This section addresses the statistical signiﬁcance of multiple collisions and random electron trajectories in the case
of an isotropic electron distribution. Isotropic distribution functions are common in laser-produced plasmas as they
are established after the ionization stage due to electron-electron and electron-ion collisions. By directly averaging
the IB heating rate over all directions of initial velocities, we examine the relative importance of electrons which
move parallel to the electric ﬁeld vector. These have been identiﬁed in Ref. [1] and above, as the source of the
enhancement in the IB heating rate. By taking an average with respect to a Maxwellian distribution function (13)
with a temperature Te, the quantum mechanical result (1) gives the following heating rate per electron

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have performed numerical simulations based on the test particle model which involves classical electron trajec-
tories in the combined electric ﬁeld of an ion and a homogeneous, high frequency laser ﬁeld. The representative results
have been compared with existing analytical theories to test the numerical results and to illustrate the diﬀerences of
our ﬁndings from current understanding of collisional processes in laser plasmas. We have conﬁrmed the recent results
by Fraiman et al. [1] and Wiesenfeld [8] regarding the existence of irregular electron orbits that closely approach an
ion many times during each scattering event and lead to large angle deﬂections and large changes in the electron
momentum. These ”anomalous” collisions have been ignored in preceding theories which signiﬁcantly underestimated
the electron heating rates under certain conditions. The irregular electron trajectories may increase the IB heating
rates in the regime of large-amplitude electric ﬁelds, v0 <
vE, and for electron velocities parallel to the electric ﬁeld
∼
of the laser. The magnitude of this enhancement depends on details of the potential at short distances and on the
form of electron distribution anisotropy.

When the quantum short-distance cut-oﬀ is introduced through an eﬀective potential, we have found a much smaller
eﬀect as compared to Fraiman et al. [1] who have used the bare Coulomb potential and have predicted an increase in the
heating rate which is inversely proportional to the electron drift velocity. In addition, electrons which are responsible
for this anomalous heating rate are statistically insigniﬁcant in the case of an isotropic electron distribution function.
On the contrary, for highly anisotropic electron distributions such as that produced by photoionization, the new eﬀect
of large angle scattering dominates the heating rate at high laser intensities. This prediction could easily be compared
with observations.

Abstract. The nonlinear interaction, due to quantum electrodynamical (QED)
eﬀects, between photons is investigated using a wave-kinetic description. Starting
from a coherent wave description, we use the Wigner transform technique to obtain
a set of wave-kinetic equations, the so called Wigner–Moyal equations. These equa-
tions are coupled to a background radiation ﬂuid, whose dynamics is determined
by an acoustic wave equation. In the slowly varying acoustic limit, we analyse the
resulting system of kinetic equations, and show that they describe instabilities, as
well as Landau-like damping. The instabilities may lead to break-up and focusing
of ultra-high intensity multi-beam systems, which in conjunction with the damping
may result in stationary strong ﬁeld structures. The results could be of relevance
for the next generation of laser-plasma systems.

1. Introduction

Currently, the development of laser technology and laser-plasma accelerators is
pushing the limits of the achievable ﬁeld strengths in laboratories to levels unprece-
dented in human history [1–5]. The successes in laser-plasma based acceleration may
even hold the promise of reaching the critical Schwinger limit, when the vacuum
becomes fully nonlinear [3]. Thus, it is clear that the nonlinear quantum electrody-
namical (QED) vacuum eﬀects will become important. Another possibility that has
been pointed out is the formation of plasma channels, evacuated plasma cavities
which could support immense ﬁeld strengths. It has been suggested that elastic
photon–photon scattering could be detected within these system, using the next
generation of laser-plasma facilities [6,7]. Moreover, a large number of astrophysical
systems, such as magnetars [8], gives rise to more extreme conditions than one could
ever produce in earth-based laboratories. As an example of nonlinear QED eﬀects,
the possibility of photon–photon scattering is perhaps the most prominent [9–11].
There has been much interest in this particular eﬀect, both from an experimental
and an astrophysical point of view (see, e.g., [12–29] and references therein, and [30]

for an up-to-date discussion and [31] for an overview). The formulation of this ef-
fect in terms of the Heisenberg–Euler Lagrangian has been used to investigate such
diverse topics as photon splitting and magnetic lensing [24–27], direct detection
via second harmonic generation [18], self-focusing [19], nonlinear wave mixing in
cavities [21, 22] and waveguide propagation [20]. The approach presented here will
be of importance for both the experimental and theoretical questions that may be
posed concerning photon–photon scattering.

2. The governing equations
Let us here start by giving a short review of the necessary equations. This will serve
as a guide for the steps to follow. We thus set up a coupled system of nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations (NLSE) for two electromagnetic pulses, and the correspond-
ing acoustic wave equation for the ﬂuid background. We then apply the Wigner
transformation to the NLSE, and obtain a coupled set of Vlasov-like equations,
the Wigner–Moyal equations. In previous work [32, 33], it has been found that the
eﬀect of photon–photon scattering is to introduce modulational and ﬁlamentational
instabilities in coherent photon systems. Here we will show that the Wigner–Moyal
system also leads to modulational instabilities, and that these can be constrained
by Landau-like damping. The results and applications thereof are then discussed.

The nonlinear self-interaction of photons can be expressed in terms of the Heisenberg–

Euler eﬀective Lagrangian [9–11]

x-axis. Note that ǫ =
1 depending on whether the pulses are parallel or anti-
parallel. For parallel propagating beams, α1,2 = 0, and the direct coupling between
the pulses vanishes. Still, because of the response of the radiation background, the
pulses are coupled, and Eqs. (2.5) exhibit spatial self-focusing [34]. Thus, we here
generalise the two-dimensional self-focusing results found perturbatively in Ref. [30]
and numerically in Ref. [32]. The results of the two-dimensional self-focusing due to
photon–photon scattering can also be understood in the context of the modulational
instability exhibited by the NLSE [32].

The equations (2.3) are coupled to the acoustic wave equation [33]

In order to analyse the stability of the system (3.3) and (3.5), we linearise according

sponding expression for Ej), where ˜̺j

In general, however, the background distribution is not mono-energetic, and due
to the spectral width of ̺0 we will have Landau-like damping manifested by the poles
of the integral (4.3). In the one-dimensional case, we can take the spectral width
κW into account by considering two equal incoherent backgrounds with ̺0(κ) =

Here we clearly see that the eﬀect of the non-zero spectral width is to introduce a

5. Discussion and conclusion

The existence of a modulational instability for mono-energetic beams strongly sug-
gests that the full nonlinear eﬀect due to photon–photon scattering of incoherent
waves in a radiation background should be taken into account, since any small per-
turbation can grow to form a large amplitude structure, given suﬃcient time. On the
other hand, as the example with a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution shows, we
must also expect the evolution to be damped by the resonant interaction between
incoherent modes and ﬂuid modes. Thus, it is not unlikely that the full system can
account for very interesting structure formation, where the initial growth is gov-
erned by a modulational type of instability, and that this growth is stabilised by the
Landau-like damping at a later stage of the dynamical phase of the photon system.
Thus, one can therefore conjecture about the existence of three-dimensional stable
photon structures generated by the vacuum nonlinearities. In order to investigate
this conjecture, a numerical analysis of the full system would be necessary.

Situations where the eﬀects presented in this paper may occur range from earth-
based laboratory systems, such as ultra-high intensity lasers [1, 2] and plasma ac-
celerators [3, 7], to astrophysical scenarios, such as the early Universe [30], gamma
ray bursts [45] and magnetars [8]. If the presents eﬀects do occur, they could also
show up on small angular scales within high precision cosmology measurements,
such as the ones presented by WMAP [46–48]. A common feature for all these sys-
tems is that they at some stage of their evolution lead to extreme radiation energy
densities, which is a key feature for probing photon–photon scattering. Thus, there
are good possibilities that in the near future one can put QED through new tests,
both in laboratory and astrophysical environments, where the latter is perhaps the
most fascinating, since it will connect very small scales to very large scales as a
fundamental theory test-bed.

In the present paper we have used a system of nonlinear Wigner–Moyal equa-
tions. These equations are coupled through a radiation ﬂuid background, where the
dynamics is determined by an acoustic wave equation driven by the incoherent pho-
tons. Using these equations, we have shown that incoherent electromagnetic pulses
can transfer energy between each other by means of the radiation ﬂuid background.
Consistent with previous work, we have moreover shown that the resulting system of

6

M. Marklund, P. K. Shukla, G. Brodin and L. Stenﬂo

equations is subject to a modulational instability, and that a nonzero spectral width
of the background incoherent photons gives rise to a damping, much like the well-
known Landau-damping of electrostatic waves in plasmas. The implications of the
results have been discussed, and it was conjectured that stable three-dimensional
electromagnetic structures may form as a result of photon–photon scattering.

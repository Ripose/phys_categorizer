We consider an application of variational-wavelet approach to
nonlinear collective models of beam/plasma physics: Vlasov/Bol-
tzmann-like reduction from general BBGKY hierachy. We obtain
fast convergent multiresolution representations for solutions which
allow to consider polynomial and rational type of nonlinearities.
The solutions are represented via the multiscale decomposition in
nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes (waveletons).

We consider an application of variational-wavelet approach to nonlinear collective models of beam/plasma
physics: Vlasov/Boltzmann-like reduction from general BBGKY hierachy. We obtain fast convergent multireso-
lution representations for solutions which allow to consider polynomial and rational type of nonlinearities. The
solutions are represented via the multiscale decomposition in nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes (waveletons).

We consider applications of numerical–analy-
tical technique based on variational-wavelet ap-
proach to nonlinear collective models of beam/
plasma physics, e.g. some forms of Vlasov/Bol-
tzmann-like reductions from general BBGKY hi-
erarchy. These equations are related to the mod-
eling of propagation of intense charged particle
beams in high-intensity accelerators and trans-
port systems [1]. In our approach we use fast con-
vergent multiresolution variational-wavelet repre-
sentations, which allows to consider polynomial
and rational type of nonlinearities [2], [3]. The so-
lutions are represented via the multiscale decom-
position in nonlinear high-localized eigenmodes,
which corresponds to the full multiresolution ex-
pansion in all underlying hidden time/space or
phase space scales.
In contrast with diﬀerent
approaches we don’t use perturbation technique
or linearization procedures. We consider rep-
resentation (3) below, where each term corre-
sponds to the contribution from the scale i in the
full underlying multiresolution decomposition as
nonlinear multiscale generalization of old δF ap-
proach [1]. As a result, fast scalar/parallel model-
ing demonstrates appearance of high-localized co-
herent structures (waveletons) and diﬀerent pat-
tern formation in systems with complex collec-
tive behaviour. Let M be the phase space of
ensemble of N particles (dimM = 6N ) with co-
ordinates xi = (qi, pi),
qi =
(q1
i ) ∈ R3 and
pi = (p1
i ) ∈ R3,

Gk(x1, . . . , xk; t) where Gk are correlators, really
have additional reductions as in case of Vlasov-
like systems. Then we have in (1), (2) polynomial
type of nonlinearities (more exactly, multilinear-
ities). Our goal is the demonstration of advan-
tages of the following representation

to equations (1), (2). It is possible to consider (3)
as multiscale nonlinear generalization of old δF
approach [1]. In (3) each δiFj term corresponds
to the contribution from the scale i in the full
underlying multiresolution decomposition . . . ⊂

Wj and bases in
scale spaces Wi(Vj ) are generated from base func-
tions ψ(ϕ) by action of aﬃne group of transla-
tions and dilations (the so called “wavelet micro-
scope”). Our constructions are based on varia-
tional approach which provides the best possible
fast convergence properties in the sense of com-
bined norm kF N +1 − F N k ≤ ε introduced in [3].
Our ﬁve basic points after functional space choice
are:
1. Ansatz-oriented choice of the (multidimen-
sional) bases related to some polynomial ten-
sor algebra.
Some examples related to gen-
eral BBGKY hierarchy are considered in [3].
2.
The choice of proper variational princi-
ple. A few projection or Galerkin-like princi-
ples for constructing (weak) solutions are con-
sidered in [2],
It should be noted ad-
vantages of formulations related to biorthogo-
nal (wavelet) decomposition. 3. The choice of
bases functions in scale spaces Wj from wavelet
zoo. They correspond to high-localized (non-
linear) oscillations/excitations, coherent (nonlin-
ear) resonances, etc. Besides fast convergence
properties of the corresponding variational-wave-

[3].

let expansions it should be noted minimal com-
plexity of all underlying calculations, especially
in case of choice of wavelet packets which mini-
mize Shannon entropy. 4. Operators representa-
tions providing maximum sparse representations
for arbitrary (pseudo)differential/integral opera-
tors df /dx, dnf /dxn,
T (x, y)f (y)dy), etc [3].
5. (Multi)linearization. Besides variation appro-
R
ach we consider a diﬀerent method to deal with
(polynomial) nonlinearities, which is based on the
para-product structures [3].

So, after application of points 1-5 above, we
arrive to explicit numerical-analytical realization
of representations (3), (4). Fig.1 demonstrates
the ﬁrst contribution to the full solution (3) while
Fig.2 presents (stable) pattern (waveleton) as so-
lution of system (2), (3). We evaluate accuracy of
calculations according to norm mentioned above
[3].

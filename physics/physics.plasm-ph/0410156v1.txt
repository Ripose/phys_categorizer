A general equation for the centroid motion of free, continuous, intense beams propagating oﬀ-axis
in solenoidal periodic focusing ﬁelds is derived. The centroid equation is found to be independent
of the speciﬁc beam distribution and may exhibit unstable solutions. A new Vlasov equilibrium
for oﬀ-axis beam propagation is also obtained. Properties of the equilibrium and the relevance of
centroid motion to beam conﬁnement are discussed.

A fundamental understanding of the kinetic equi-
librium and stability properties of high-current,
low-
emittance beams in periodically focusing systems is cru-
cial for the development of a wide range of advanced
particle accelerator and coherent radiation source appli-
cations. For a long time, the Kapchinskij-Vladimirskij
(KV) distribution [1] was the only Vlasov equilibrium
distribution known for the propagation of periodically
focused intense particle beams. Equilibrium and stabil-
ity analysis based on the KV beam have been critical to
the development and understanding of the physics of in-
tense beams [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. More recently, it
has been shown that the KV distribution can be general-
ized to allow for rigid beam rotation with respect to the
Larmor frame in periodic solenoidal focusing ﬁelds [11].
Studies indicate that rotation may have an important
role in particle beam stability [12].

In the derivation of these Vlasov equilibria it is always
assumed that the beam is perfectly aligned with the sym-
metry axis of the focusing ﬁeld [1, 5, 11]. Actually, this
simplifying assumption is generally used in the analy-
sis of intense beams [7] because the axis is an equilib-
rium for the beam centroid, and the equilibrium is stable
if smooth-beam approximations are employed where the
periodic ﬂuctuations of the focusing ﬁeld are averaged out
[13]. In some cases, however, we may expect the onset of
parametric resonances involving the centroid motion and
the focusing ﬁeld oscillations, which would destabilize the
centroid motion and heavily aﬀect the overall beam dy-
namics.
In such conditions the averaging procedure is
no longer valid and a detailed description of the centroid
dynamics becomes mandatory.

In this paper, we derive from a kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell
description a general equation for the centroid motion
of free, continuous, intense beams propagating oﬀ-axis
It is shown that
in solenoidal periodic focusing ﬁelds.
the centroid obeys a Mathieu type equation. The equa-
tion is independent of the speciﬁc beam distribution and

becomes unstable whenever the oscillatory frequency of
the centroid, which is related to the rms focusing ﬁeld
strength per lattice, is commensurable with the focusing
ﬁeld periodicity itself.
In the particular case of a uni-
form beam density around the beam centroid, we show
that there exists a self-consistent Vlasov equilibrium dis-
tribution for the beam dynamics. The beam envelope
that determines de outer radius of the equilibrium beam
around the centroid is shown to obey the familiar en-
velope equation [5, 7, 14, 15], being independent of the
centroid motion. An example of the Vlasov equilibrium
is discussed in detail to show the possibility of ﬁnding
beam solutions for which the extensively studied enve-
lope equation [3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16] is stable, whereas the
centroid motion is unstable, revealing the importance of
the centroid motion to overall beam conﬁnement proper-
ties.

We consider a free, continuous charged-particle beam
propagating with average axial velocity βbcˆez through a
periodic solenoidal focusing magnetic ﬁeld described by

B(r, s) = Bz(s)ˆez −

where r = xˆex + yˆey, r = (x2 + y2)1/2 is the radial
distance from the ﬁeld symmetry axis, s = z = βbct is
the axial coordinate, Bz(s + S) = Bz(s) is the magnetic
ﬁeld on the axis, the prime denotes derivative with re-
spect to s, c is the speed of light in vacuo, and S is the
periodicity length of the magnetic focusing ﬁeld. Since
we are dealing with solenoidal focusing, it is convenient
to work in the Larmor frame of reference [7], which ro-
tates with respect to the laboratory frame with angu-
lar velocity ΩL(s) = qBz(s)/2γbmc, where q, m and
γb = (1 − β2
b )−1/2 are, respectively, the charge, mass
and relativistic factor of the beam particles. The Larmor
frame is used throughout the paper, such that ˆex and ˆey
are assumed to be versors along the rotating axes.

tion fb(r, v, s) evolves according to the Vlasov-Maxwell

because ∇ψ → 0 as r → ∞ for beams in free space.
In Eq. (10), dA and ˆen are, respectively, the boundary
diﬀerential element and the unit vector normal to the
boundary of integration located at r → ∞. In fact, the
result ∇ψ = 0 is expected based on the action-reaction
law; since −∇ψ corresponds to the self-force exerted on
the beam particles by themselves, its average throughout
the beam distribution has to vanish due to the pairwise
structure of the interparticle electromagnetic interaction.
Using Eqs. (7) and (10) in Eq. (6), we ﬁnally obtain the
centroid equation of motion

Let us stress that we have not made any assumption
on the particular form of the beam distribution func-
tion so far. Thus, the centroid equation above is al-
ways valid as long as the beam evolves according to the
Vlasov-Maxwell system, Eqs. (2)-(4). In the laboratory
frame, combined to the oscillatory motion described by
(11) the centroid also rotates with angular veloc-
Eq.
ity ΩL(s) around the center r = 0. Taking into ac-
count that κz(s) is periodic, Eq. (11) is of the Math-
ieu type which is known to present unstable solutions
related to parametric resonances in the ¯r motion. If we
conveniently write the average of κz(s) over one lattice
0/S2, where σ0 is a dimen-
period as (1/S)
sionless parameter proportional to the rms focusing ﬁeld
measuring the vacuum phase advance in the small ﬁeld,
smooth-beam approximation, the instabilities in the cen-
troid motion are expected when one approaches σ0 ∼ nπ;
this condition corresponds to parametric resonances be-
tween the oscillation periodicity of ¯r in the average (rms)
focusing ﬁeld and the periodicity of the focusing ﬁeld it-
self. Depending on the exact proﬁle of κz(s) the size of
the unstable regions surrounding σ0 ∼ nπ vary signiﬁ-
cantly. If the aim is beam conﬁnement, these regions are
to be avoided.

It is worth mentioning that although Eq.

(11) is
strictly valid for free beams only, it is expected to pro-
vide a good description of the centroid motion in bounded
systems if the beam is nearly symmetric and is not ex-
cessively displaced from a pipe center located at r = 0.
The reason is because in this case ∇ψ = ±ˆen|∇ψ| at the
pipe walls, where ˆen is now the unit vector normal to
the wall, and the surface integral in Eq. (10), performed
along the boundary, still vanishes since |∇ψ| is approx-
imately constant there. Note also that the presence of
a pipe would generally not suppress the centroid insta-
bilities discussed in connection with Eq. (11); in fact, it
would even enhance it because the image charges induced
are of opposite sign, attracting the beam to the wall.

Our next task is to show that we can construct a Vlasov
equilibrium for oﬀ-axis beam transport. In particular, we
assume a beam with a uniform radial density distributed
around a center located at ro(s) = xo(s)ˆex +yo(s)ˆey, i.e.,

nb(r, s) =

Nb/πr2
0,

b (s),

(cid:26)

rδ < rb(s),
rδ > rb(s),

(12)

where rb(s) is the equilibrium beam envelope and rδ ≡
r − ro. A schematic of the beam distribution of Eq. (12)
and corresponding vectors is shown in Fig. 1. For such
beam we can easily recognize ro(s) as being the centroid
coordinate. According to what was shown previously, its
evolution must then obey

ro

′′ + κz(s)ro = 0.

Using the prescribed nb(r, s) in Eq. (3) we ﬁnd for the
normalized self-potential

in the beam interior (rδ < rb). Therefore, a single par-

nal focusing ﬁeld force −κz(s)r and the self-ﬁeld force
−∇ψ(r, s) will evolve according to

If we now subtract Eq. (13) from Eq. (15) we obtain

which describes the motion of the beam particle with
respect to the center ro. Equation (16) can be solved
with known techniques of physics of beams [5, 7]. Con-
sidering the motion along the x-axis, we write xδ =

that all the forces are central with respect to the centroid

where χ = xδ, yδ, and the brackets indicate averages over
the beam distribution. One thus sees that a Vlasov equi-
librium distribution can be formed for which the beam
envelope obeys Eq. (22) with constant emittance even
when the centroid moves oﬀ-axis, ro 6= 0, following the
dynamics dictated by Eq. (13). We refer to this equilib-
rium as a periodically focused oﬀ-axis Vlasov equilibrium.
Let us call attention to the interesting fact that the cen-
troid motion and the envelope dynamics are uncoupled in
this case. In other words, centroid dynamics does not af-
fect the known stability results for the envelope dynamics
[3, 4, 8, 10, 16] and is not aﬀected by the latter as well.
One should keep in mind that for good beam conﬁnement
both centroid and envelope have to be stable.

We now illustrate our results with an example of peri-
odically focused oﬀ-axis Vlasov equilibrium. We consider
a particular set of parameters for which the envelope
equation (22) is known to be stable, whereas the cen-
troid motion of Eq. (13) was found to be unstable. We
investigate beam transport with the aid of self-consistent
numerical simulations, where a large number Nb = 8000
of macroparticles interact via pairwise electromagnetic
interactions [9]. In the simulation we used SK/ǫT = 5.0
and S2κz(s) = σ2
0[1 + cos(2πs/S)], with σ0 = 155o, over
20 lattice periods. The macroparticles were launched at
s = 0 according to the equilibrium distribution, Eq. (21),
with ωb = 0, ro = 0 = ro
′, and rb corresponding to the
matched solution with rb(s + S) = rb(s) of the enve-
lope equation (22). The ﬁnite number of macroparticles
in the initial condition acts as a seed for any possible
instability to develop. Simulation results are presented
in Fig. 2. The evolution of the centroid displacement
ro ≡ |ro| calculated from the macroparticles positions
r as ro =< r >, where the brackets indicate average
over macroparticles, is shown in Fig. 2(a) (circles). It
reveals that the centroid motion develops the typical ex-
ponential growth of unstable dynamics that agrees with
the fact that the set of parameters considered leads to

an unstable solution of Eq. (13). The solid line corre-
sponds to the solution obtained from Eq. (13). Despite
the centroid instability, the beam equilibrium distribu-
tion is preserved as veriﬁed in Fig. 2(b) that shows that
rms emittance is well conserved as the beam evolves.
RMS emittance is calculated according to Eq.
(23),
considering averages over macroparticles. Finally, Fig.
2(c) compares the envelope obtained from the envelope
equation (22) with that obtained from the simulation,
rb = [2 < (r − ro)2 >]1/2, for the last 3 periods of the fo-
cusing channel. The perfect agreement proves once more
the preservation of the equilibrium distribution. More-
over, we see that in spite of the unstable centroid the
envelope is stable, as predicted.

To conclude, based on kinetic grounds we have derived
a general equation for the centroid motion of free, con-
tinuous, intense beams propagating oﬀ-axis in solenoidal
periodic focusing ﬁelds. It was shown that the centroid
equation is independent of the speciﬁc beam distribu-
tion and may exhibit unstable solutions. In the partic-
ular case of a uniform beam density around the beam
centroid, we have shown the existence of a periodically
focused oﬀ-axis Vlasov equilibrium distribution describ-
ing a beam that rigidly rotates with a prescribed angular
velocity around a moving centroid. The beam envelope
around the centroid was shown to obey the familiar enve-
lope equation, being independent of the centroid motion.
An example of periodically focused oﬀ-axis Vlasov equi-
librium was discussed in detail to show the possibility of
ﬁnding beam solutions for which the envelope equation
is stable, whereas the centroid motion is unstable, re-
vealing the importance of centroid motion to the overall
beam conﬁnement properties.

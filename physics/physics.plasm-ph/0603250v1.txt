Abstract

The ion sphere model introduced long ago by Salpeter is placed in a rigorous theoretical set-

ting. The leading corrections to this model for very highly charged but dilute ions in thermal

equilibrium with a weakly coupled, one-component background plasma are explicitly computed,

and the subleading corrections shown to be negligibly small. This is done using the eﬀective ﬁeld

theory methods advocated by Brown and Yaﬀe. Thus, corrections to nuclear reaction rates that

such highly charged ions may undergo can be computed precisely. Moreover, their contribution to

the equation of state can also be computed with precision. Such analytic results for very strong

coupling are rarely available, and they can serve as benchmarks for testing computer models in

this limit.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

Here we describe a plasma conﬁguration whose exact asymptotic solution can be obtained

in a strong coupling limit. The solution is given by the ion sphere result presented by Salpeter

[1] plus a simple smaller correction. This is accomplished by using the eﬀective plasma ﬁeld

theory methods advocated by Brown and Yaﬀe [2]. In this ﬁeld-theory language, the old

Salpeter result corresponds to the tree approximation and our new correction is the one-loop

term. In usual perturbative expansions, the tree approximation provides the ﬁrst, lowest-

order term for weak coupling. Here, on the contrary, the tree approximation provides the

leading term for strong coupling, with the corrections of higher order in the inverse coupling.

This is the only example of which we are aware in which the tree approximation yields the

strong coupling limit. This strongly coupled system is interesting from a theoretical point

of view and our results can be used to check numerical methods.

The plasma consists of very dilute “impurity” ions of very high charge Zpe, Zp ≫ 1, in

thermal equilibrium with a classical, one-component “background” plasma of charge ze and

number density n, at temperature T = 1/β. The background plasma is neutralized in the

usual way, and it is dilute. We use rationalized electrostatic units and measure temperature

in energy units so that the background plasma Debye wave number appears as

The internal coupling of the background plasma is described by the dimensionless coupling

parameter

The assumed weak coupling of the dilute background plasma is conveyed by

κ2 = β (ze)2 n .

g = β

κ =

(ze)2
4π

(ze)2
4πT

κ .

g ≪ 1 .

Although the internal coupling of the background plasma to itself is assumed to be very

weak and the impurity ions are assumed to be so very dilute that their internal interactions

are also very small, we shall require that the ionic charge Zp is so great that the coupling

between the impurity ions and the background plasma is very large. To make this condition

more precise, we deﬁne

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

(1.4)

¯Zp =

Zp
z

,

2

which is the magnitude of the impurity charge measured in units of the dilute background

ionic charge. Then the explicit condition that we require is that

g ¯Zp ≫ 1 .

(1.5)

Since the limit that we use may appear to be obscure, we pause to clarify it. Even though
g ¯Zp ≫ 1, we assume that g is suﬃciently small that g2 ¯Zp ≪ 1. We may, for example, take
g → 0 with gα ¯Zp = const., and α in the interval 1 < α < 2. Then g ¯Zp = const./gα−1 ≫ 1
while g2 ¯Zp = const. g2−α ≪ 1.

Standard methods express the grand canonical partition function in terms of functional

integrals. Brown and Yaﬀe [2] do this, introduce an auxiliary electrostatic potential, and

integrate out the charged particle degrees of freedom to obtain the eﬀective theory. This

technique will be described in more detail in Sec. II below. The saddle point expansion

of this form for the grand partition function yields a perturbative expansion, with the tree

approximation providing the lowest-order term. Here, on the contrary, we express the im-

purity ion number in terms of an eﬀective ﬁeld theory realized by a functional integral. The

saddle point of this form of the functional integral involves a classical ﬁeld solution driven

by a strong point charge.

Here N (0)

evaluation of the classical action displayed in the ¯Z 5/3

in the limit in which we work (gZ ≫ 1). The constant C = 0.8499 · · · . The ﬁnal −g ¯Zp/3

term in the exponent is the relatively small one-loop correction. As shown in detail in the

discussion leading to Eq. (3.63) below, the error in the result (1.6) is of the indicated order
g2 ¯Zp = g (g ¯Zp) and is thus negligible in the limit g ≪ 1 that concerns us.

The number correction (1.6) can be used to construct the grand canonical partition

function Z for the combined system by integrating the generic relation

The equation of state is then determined from the well-known relation for a grand canonical

ensemble with partition function Z,

N =

Although the fraction of impurity ions in the plasma Np/N may be quite small, there may
be a signiﬁcant pressure modiﬁcation if ¯Zp is very large.

The number result (1.6) also directly yields the plasma correction to a nuclear fusion

rate, since

where ΓC is the nuclear reaction rate for a thermal, Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the

initial (1,2) particles in the absence of the background plasma. We use the notation 1 + 2 to

denote an eﬀective particle that carries the charge (Z1 + Z2)e. This formula was obtained in

a diﬀerent guise by DeWitt, Graboske, and Cooper [3]. The relation of the form (1.10) that

we use to previous results is discussed in detail in the Appendix. The formula holds when

the Coulomb barrier classical turning point of the nuclear reaction is small in comparison

with the plasma Debye length. This is spelled out in detail in a recent work by Brown,

Dooling, and Preston [4] who also show that the result (1.10) is valid even if the background

plasma involves quantum corrections. The conditions needed for the formula (1.10) to hold

are also discussed in the work of Brown and Sawyer [5], although sometimes in a rather

implicit fashion. This work does show, however, that the result (1.10) is valid if κ rmax ≪ 1,
where κ = βe2n is the Debye wave number and rmax is the turning point radius deﬁned
by rmax = 2(e2/4π mω2)1/3 where ω = 2π T /~ is the imaginary time frequency associated

with the temperature T . It should be remarked that DeWitt, Graboske, and Cooper [3]

assumed that the nuclear reaction rate formula (1.10) held only if the background plasma

4

had a classical character, but that the work of Brown, Dooling, and Preston [4] shows that

it is valid even if the plasma involves quantum eﬀects.

Our result (1.6) for the number corrections presents the plasma correction to the fusion

rate for our special case as

II. REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST

To begin, we need to review a simple case of the general plasma eﬀective ﬁeld theory

formulation presented by Brown and Yaﬀe [2]. First we note that the grand canonical

partition function for a one-component classical plasma may be expressed as the functional

integral (which are discussed in detail, for example, in the ﬁrst chapter of the book by Brown

[6]) ,

We use rationalized Gaussian units so that, for example, the Coulomb potential appears as

φ = e/4π r. We shall be a little cavalier about the uniform, rigid neutralizing background

that we tacitly assume to be present. We shall explicitly include its eﬀects when needed.

The validity of the functional integral representation (2.1) is easy to establish. The second

part in the exponential is written out in a series so as to produce the fugacity expansion

with no coupling linear in χ′. The original measure [dχ] = [dχ′] is taken to include factors

such that this remaining purely Gaussian function integral is simply unity. For pedagogical

these manipulations as

This is precisely the familiar fugacity expansion of the classical grand canonical partition

function. The diagonal sum where a = b in the Coulomb potential must be deleted. This

omission of the inﬁnite self-energy terms is automatic if the dimensional regularization

6

scheme is employed as advocated by Brown and Yaﬀe [2]. Here we shall instead regu-

late the theory by (at ﬁrst implicitly) replacing the point source δ(r − ra) with a source

δR(r − ra) that has a small extent about ra and (at ﬁrst implicitly) removing the self energy

terms, with the limit δR → δ ﬁnally taken in the subtracted theory.

The derivative of the logarithm of a grand canonical partition function with respect to a

chemical potential (times β) gives the particle number conjugate to that chemical potential.

Thus, if we temporarily add another particle species p of charge ep = Zpe to the previous

functional integral, take the described derivative, and then take the limit in which this new

species is very dilute, we get the desired functional integral representation for the background

plasma correction to the new species free particle number relation in the presence of plasma

interactions,

(2.8)

To express this more precisely, in Eq. (2.8) N (0)

p V exp{βµp}, where the subscript
p is used to indicate that these are the properties of the sparsely populated ‘impurity’

ions of charge ep = Zpe, with V denoting the system volume. So Eq. (2.8) describes the

background plasma correction to the free-particle chemical potential – number relationship

for these p ions immersed in the weakly-coupled, one-component plasma. The original

chemical potential derivative that leads to this result entailed a volume integral. In virtue

of the translational invariance of the background plasma, the result is independent of the

particular value of the spatial coordinate in the electric potential χ(r) in the initial factor,
and this coordinate may be placed at the origin (as we have done), giving the factor eiepβ χ(0)
shown. The volume integral then combines to form the total free-particle number N (0)

that

p

appears as a prefactor. We have now subtracted terms from the second exponential, the

exponential of the action functional of the background plasma, to remove an overall number

contribution and to include the eﬀect of the rigid neutralizing background. These same

subtractions must now be made in the normalizing partition function Z that appears in

the denominator of Eq. (2.8). Thus Z is deﬁned by the functional integral of the second

exponential that appears in Eq. (2.8). The eﬀect of the uniform neutralizing rigid background

7

charge is contained in the term izeβχ that is subtracted from the exponential exp{izeβχ}.

The additional 1 is subtracted from this exponential for convenience.

To simplify the notation, we write Eq. (2.8) as simply

Np =

N (0)
p
Z

[dχ] e−S[χ] ,

(2.9)

Z
where the eﬀective action S[χ] contains all the terms in both exponents in Eq. (2.8). The

loop expansion is an expansion about the saddle point of the functional integral. At this

point, the action S[χ] is stationary, and thus the ﬁeld χ at this point obeys the classical

ﬁeld equation implied by the stationarity of the action.

The tree approximation is given by the evaluation of S[χ] at the classical solution

χ(r) → iφcl(r) ,

(2.10)

namely

S[iφcl] = −

This equation deﬁning the classical potential φcl(r) is of the familiar Debye-H¨uckel form, and

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

it could have been written down using simple physical reasoning. However, we have placed it

in the context of a systematic perturbative expansion in which the error of omitted terms can

be ascertained. In particular, we shall describe the one-loop correction that is automatically

produced by our formalism. Moreover, we shall prove that higher-order corrections may be

neglected. Our approach using controlled approximations in which the error is assessed, and

making precise evaluations of a well deﬁned perturbative expansions in terms of correctly

identiﬁed coupling parameters, diﬀers in spirit from much of the traditional work in plasma

physics. For example, although previous work has been done by Vieillefosse [7] on the

solution of the non-linear Debye-H¨uckel equation, this work was not done in the context of

a systematic, controlled approximation.

8

The one-loop correction to this ﬁrst tree approximation is obtained by writing the func-

tional integration variable as

χ(r) = iφcl(r) + χ′(r) ,

(2.13)

and expanding the total action in Eq. (2.9) to quadratic order in the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld χ′.

Since iφcl obeys the classical ﬁeld equation, there are no linear terms in χ′ and we have, to

quadratic order,

where

integral produces an inﬁnite dimensional, Fredholm determinant.

In this same one-loop

order, the normalizing partition function Z is given by the same determinant except that it

is evaluated at φcl = 0. Hence, to tree plus one-loop order,

(2.16)

III. COMPUTATION

A. Tree

To solve the classical ﬁeld equation (2.12) in the large Zp limit, we ﬁrst note that the

classical potential must vanish asymptotically so as to ensure that the resulting total charge

density vanishes at large distances form the ‘external’ point charge ep = Zpe,

|r| → ∞ :

en

1 − e−βze φcl(r)

→ 0 .

(cid:2)
Since φcl vanishes asymptotically, its deﬁning diﬀerential equation (2.12) reduces at large

(cid:3)

distances to

(3.1)

(3.2)

−∇2φcl(r) ≃ −κ2 φcl(r) ,

9

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

and thus, for |r| large,

φcl(r) ≃ (const)

e−κ|r|
|r|

.

Since this is exponentially damped, the coordinate integral of the left-hand side of Eq. (2.12)

vanishes by Gauss’ theorem, and we obtain the integral constraint

z n

(dr)

1 − e−βze φcl(r)

= Zp .

Z

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

For small r ≡ |r|, the point source driving term in the classical ﬁeld equation dominates,

giving the Coulomb potential solution

Thus we write

where

φcl(r) ≃

Zpe
4π r

.

φcl(r) =

u(ξ) ,

Zpe
4π r

ξ = κr ,

u(0) = 1 .

and the point driving charge Zpe is now conveyed in the boundary condition

The other boundary condition is the previously noted large r limit (3.3) which now appears

as

ξ → ∞ :

u(ξ) ∼ e− ξ .

The action (2.11) corresponding to the classical solution is divergent since it includes

the inﬁnite self-energy of the point charge ep = Zpe impurity. This self-energy must be

subtracted to yield the ﬁnite, physical action. Following standard practice in quantum

ﬁeld theory, the divergent classical action (2.11) and the self-energy are ﬁrst regularized

— rendered ﬁnite — by replacing the point charge with a ﬁnite source. The self-energy

is then subtracted, and ﬁnally the point source limit is taken. Regularization is achieved

by the replacement δ(r) → δR(r), where δR(r) is a smooth function of compact support.

The regularized action obtained by making this substitution in the action S[iφcl] deﬁned by

Eq. (2.11) will be denoted as Sreg. The regularized self ﬁeld φself(r) is the solution of

−∇2 φself(r) = Zpe δR(r) ,

Ion Sphere Model

In the large ¯Zp limit which concerns us, the short distance form (3.5) (multiplied by βze) is
large (compared to one) over a wide range of |r|, and the Boltzmann factor exp{−βzeφcl(r)}

is quite small in this range. We are thus led to the “ion sphere model” brought forth some

time ago by Salpeter [1]. This model makes the step-function approximation

Here the term linear in ξ, a solution of the homogeneous equation, has been determined

[Without this

constrain an additional δ(ξ − ξ0) would appear on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.24).] The

nature of this “ion-sphere” solution u0(ξ) together with the exact solution u(ξ) obtained by

the numerical integration of Eq. (3.20), as well as the ﬁrst correction described below, are

displayed in Fig. 1.

We have appended the subscript 0 to indicate that this is the solution for the ion sphere

constants clearly cancels in the ratio (1.10) that yields the background plasma correction to

Ion Sphere Model Corrected

To ﬁnd the leading correction to the ion sphere model result, we ﬁrst cast the exact

equations in a diﬀerent form. We start by writing the full solution u(ξ) as

u(ξ) = u0(ξ) +

v(ξ) ,

ξ0
¯Zpg

where u0(ξ) is the solution (3.25) to the ion sphere model (3.24). The exact diﬀerential

equation (3.20) now reads

(3.27)

(3.28)

Since u0(0) = 1 is ﬁxed (reﬂecting the presence of the large, ‘impurity’ point charge Zpe), and

since the solution must vanish at inﬁnity, the proper solution to the non-linear diﬀerential

equation (3.28) is deﬁned by the boundary conditions

v(0) = 0 ,

ξ → ∞ :

v(ξ) → 0 .

(3.29)

On substituting the decomposition (3.27) into the action (3.19), the cross term may be

integrated by parts with no end-point contributions in virtue of the boundary conditions

(3.29) on v(ξ). We take advantage of this to move the derivative of v(ξ) over to act upon

u0(ξ) so that we now have d2u0(ξ)/dξ2. Using Eq. (3.24) for this second derivative and

identifying the ion sphere part then gives

Thus far we have made no approximations. To obtain the leading correction to the ion

sphere result, we note, as we have remarked before, that the factor exp

¯Zpg
ξ u0(ξ)

is very

small for ξ < ξ0, and so it may be evaluated by expanding u0(ξ) about ξ = ξ0. Using the

This approximation is valid for all ξ because when ξ is somewhat smaller than ξ0 and our

expansion near the end point breaks down, the argument in the exponent is so large that

the exponential function essentially vanishes. Indeed, since we consider the limit in which

ξ0 is taken to be very large and the Gaussian contribution is very narrow on the scale set

by ξ0, we may approximate

It is easy to see that the ﬁrst correction v1(ξ) does not alter the integral constraint (3.21).

Placing the decomposition (3.27) in the constraint (3.21) and using the leading-order form

(3.32) together with v(ξ) replaced by v1(ξ) can be used to express the putative change in

ξ ≫ ξ0 :

v1(ξ) ∼ e−ξ .

where c1 is a constant that is yet to be determined. For large ξ, v1(ξ) is small and thus

obeys the linearized version of Eq. (3.34),

Since this damps rapidly on the scale set by ξ0 = (3 ¯Zpg)1/3 ≫ 1, the leading correction v1(ξ)

that we seek is given by the solution to

ξ > ξ0 :

d2v1(ξ)
dξ2 = 1 − e−v1(ξ) ,

which is the previous diﬀerential equation (3.34) in this region, but with the explicit factors

of ξ/ξ0 and ξ0/ξ replaced by 1. This new approximate second-order, non-linear diﬀerential

equation is akin to a one-dimensional equation of motion of a particle in a potential with

ξ playing the role of time, and v1(ξ) playing the role of position. Thus there is an “energy

constant of the motion”. Namely, if we multiply Eq. (3.43) by dv1/dξ, we obtain a total

The diﬀerent functional forms for v1(ξ) in the two regions ξ < ξ0 and ξ > ξ0 are joined

by the continuity constraint (3.38), which we write simply as

c1 ξ0 = v1(ξ0) ,

together with the slope jump (3.37) which, using Eq. (3.46), now requires that

Since we require that ξ0 ≫ 1, the second term on the right-hand side of this constraint may

be neglected, which results in a transcendental equation deﬁning v1(ξ0), whose solution is

v1(ξ0) = 0.6967 · · · .

We are now in a position to evaluate the leading contribution to the action (3.30). Since

v1(ξ) damps rapidly on the scale set by ξ0, in computing the leading term we can set ξ = ξ0

in the integral that is linear in v1(ξ). The leading correction is given by

but also ¯Zpg ≫ 1 as well, κr0 ≫ 1, and the ion sphere radius r0 is large in comparison to

where in the second equality we have used the ion sphere model that gives the leading term
for large ¯Zp.

This result is physically obvious. The impurity ion of very high ¯Zp carves out a hole of

radius r0 in the original, background plasma, a hole that is a vacuum as far as the original

ions are concerned. The original, background plasma is unchanged outside this hole. This
ion sphere picture gives the leading terms for very large impurity charge ¯Zp. The corrections

that smooth out the sharp boundaries in this picture only produce higher-order terms. The

original, background plasma had a vanishing electrostatic potential everywhere, and the

potential in the ion sphere picture now vanishes outside the sphere of radius r0. Thus the

grand potential of the background plasma is now reduced by the amount that was originally

contained within the sphere of radius r0, and this is exactly what is stated to one-loop order

in Eq.(3.61).

This argument carries on to the higher loop terms as well, but we shall now also sketch

the application of the previous formal manipulations to them as well.

E. Higher Loops

As shown in detail in the paper of Brown and Yaﬀe [2], n-loop terms in the expansion

of the background plasma partition function with no impurities present involve a factor of

κ2 κn which combines with other charge and temperature factors to give dimensionless terms

of the form

gn−1

(d3r) κ3 .

(3.62)

Z

19

With the very high ¯Zp impurity ions present, each factor of κ is accompanied by
exp{−(1/2)βe φcl(r)} whose spatial variation can be neglected except in the ﬁnal, over-

all volume integral. Thus, in the strong coupling limit of the type that we have set, we have

the order estimate

(3.63)

Again, since we assume that g is suﬃciently small so that although g ¯Zp ≫ 1, g2 ¯Zp ≪ 1,

all the higher loop terms may be neglected.

In this discussion, we have glossed over the powers of ln g that enter into the higher-order

terms as well as the quantum corrections that can occur in higher orders. They vanish in

our strong coupling limit.

APPENDIX: RATE RELATED TO PREVIOUS WORK

We write the result (1.10) in the form used by Brown, Dooling, and Preston [4] (BDP)

which is not the notation of DeWitt, Graboske, and Cooper [3] (DGC). In the grand canon-

ical methods employed by BDP, the temperature and chemical potentials are the basic, fun-

damental parameters. Thus, in this grand canonical description, the eﬀect of the background

plasma on nuclear reaction rates appears in terms of number changes with the chemical po-

tentials held ﬁxed. On the other hand, in the canonical ensemble description employed by

DGC, the temperature and particle numbers are the basic, fundamental parameters.

To connect the two approaches, for the relevant case in which “impurity” ions p are

dilutely mixed in a background plasma, we ﬁrst note the general structure in the grand

canonical method. Since the impurities are very dilute, the eﬀect of the background plasma

on their number is entirely contained in the ﬁrst term of the fugacity expansion, the linear

20

term in zp = exp{βµp}. In the free-particle limit where there is no coupling of the impurities

to the background plasma, the impurity number density – chemical potential connection

reads

p = gsp λ−3
n(0)

p eβµp ,

where gsp and λp are the impurities’ spin weight and thermal wavelength, respectively. Thus

the eﬀect of the background plasma appears as

np = n(0)

p e∆p = gsp λ−3

p eβµp e∆p ,

where we have chosen to write the plasma correction in terms of an exponential. The only

feature of the correction ∆p that we need note is that it is independent of the impurity

fugacity zp since we are working in the zp → 0 limit. In summary, the correction in the

grand canonical description appears as

with the total number NP = npV, where V is the volume of the system.

The grand canonical partition function Z for the complete system including the various

impurity ions deﬁnes the thermodynamic potential Ω(β, µ) via

and the particle number Na of species a with chemical potential µa is given by

Hence, since generically ∂N (0)/∂µ = βN (0), this can be integrated to produce

where ΩB is the thermodynamic potential of the background plasma in the absence of the

extra impurity ions and where, as we have just shown,

These authors sometimes write this in terms of a ‘chemical potential’. However, within the

grand canonical description that we always employ, a chemical potential is an independent

variable that is not changed as interactions are altered, and so in the context that we use

this nomenclature is not suitable..

Under the conditions of weak Langmuir turbulence, a self-consistent wave-particle Hamiltonian
models the eﬀective nonlinear interaction of a spectrum of M waves with N resonant out-of-
equilibrium tail electrons. In order to address its intrinsically nonlinear time-asymptotic behavior,
a Monte Carlo code was built to estimate its equilibrium statistical mechanics in both the canonical
and microcanonical ensembles. First the single wave model is considered in the cold beam/plasma
instability and in the O’Neil setting for nonlinear Landau damping. O’Neil’s threshold, that sep-
arates nonzero time-asymptotic wave amplitude states from zero ones, is associated to a second
order phase transition. These two studies provide both a testbed for the Monte Carlo canonical
and microcanonical codes, with the comparison with exact canonical results, and an opportunity
to propose quantitative results to longstanding issues in basic nonlinear plasma physics. Then the
properly speaking weak turbulence framework is considered through the case of a large spectrum of
waves. Focusing on the small coupling limit, as a benchmark for the statistical mechanics of weak
Langmuir turbulence, it is shown that Monte Carlo microcanonical results fully agree with an exact
microcanonical derivation. The wave spectrum is predicted to collapse towards small wavelengths
together with the escape of initially resonant particles towards low bulk plasma thermal speeds.
This study reveals the fundamental discrepancy between the long-time dynamics of single waves,
that can support ﬁnite amplitude steady states, and of wave spectra, that cannot.

INTRODUCTION

Wave-particle interaction is a universal phenomenon in space and laboratory plasmas. Its importance ranges from
magnetic conﬁnement fusion devices, in particular with its relation to anomalous transport or supplementary heating,
to laser plasma interaction, astrophysics and charged particle beam physics. It is responsible for high-frequency plasma
turbulence which diﬀers substantially from low-frequency ﬂuid or magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. In this article,
we shall consider one of the simplest wave-particle interaction settings, namely electrostatic wave-particle interaction
taking place in bump-on-tail or weak beam-plasma instabilities.

Under the conditions of weak Langmuir turbulence [1], electrostatic wave-particle interaction may be modeled
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6] by a reduced system coupling self-consistently a set of M longitudinal (Langmuir) waves to N quasi-
resonant tail particles. This approach is especially appropriate to the description of basic plasma kinetic phenomena
such as the bump-on-tail instability [7] or Landau damping [8]. In this reduced framework, the eﬀective dynamics
is ruled by a (M + N )-dimensional Hamiltonian system. More speciﬁcally, particles in the background plasma
(whose velocities are roughly smaller than the thermal velocity) only participate to the dynamics via a small subset
of collective modes, the Langmuir (long-wavelength) modes of longitudinal oscillation around their guiding-center
positions. These modes are described by action-angle variables (Ij, θj) with 1
M for the M waves. In the
absence of resonant particles, they oscillate with constant angular frequencies dθj/dt = ω0j, that, according to the
Bohm-Gross dispersion relation, are approximately equal to the plasma frequency ωp for long-wavelength modes.
These waves strongly interact with those plasma particles in the tails of the distribution function having velocities
v close to ω0j/kj. The coupling is controlled by the small parameter η that is the ratio of the tail density over the
bulk plasma density. The dynamics of N identical quasi-resonant particles moving on the interval of length L with
periodic boundary conditions, with unit mass and charge, and respectively position xr and momentum pr, interacting
with M waves with wavenumbers kj = j2π/L, derives then from the Hamiltonian

It is important here to insist on the principle of this derivation: the background plasma is assumed to respond linearly
to the waves which is valid provided resonant particles, whose velocities are much larger than plasma thermal velocity,
only form a small fraction, η, of the total plasma. Moreover it is interesting to note that the same kind of wave-particle
reduction has been undertaken for other physical regimes of wave-particle interaction. In particular, a Hamiltonian
self-consistent wave-particle model [9] has recently been built in order to study the nonlinear interaction of a packet
of waves with a nonequilibrium electron distribution in a magnetized background plasma.

Under the above hypotheses, the Hamiltonian model (1) contains the eﬀective dynamics of weak Langmuir tur-
bulence. Yet, if a Hamiltonian system exhibits some ergodicity, then thermodynamics states that time averages
can be replaced with equivalent space averages over the microcanonical ensemble. A Monte Carlo code was built
to estimate the equilibrium statistical mechanics of (1) in both the canonical and microcanonical ensembles. This
provides an eﬃcient tool to investigate the time-asymptotic fate of the wave-particle model and discuss the evolution
of weak Langmuir turbulence. This is of particular interest in the broad spectrum case where direct thermodynamical
derivations are diﬃcult.

In Section II, we present the canonical ensemble of the M waves/N particles self-consistent Hamiltonian model and
focus on the M = 1 case. In Sec. III, we consider the cold beam/plasma instability where the single wave approxima-
tion is particularly appropriate. Then, in Sec. IV, we apply the single wave model to the original O’Neil setting [10]
for nonlinear Landau damping and, in parallel with microcanonical Monte Carlo results, associate O’Neil’s threshold
to a second order phase transition. These two studies provide both a testbed for the Monte Carlo canonical and
microcanonical codes, with the comparison with exact canonical results, and an opportunity to propose quantitative
results to longstanding issues in basic nonlinear plasma physics. It is shown that statistical mechanics is a useful quan-
titative tool to address the nonlinear time-asymptotic saturation stage. Quantitative comparisons with experiments
are given. Then, in Sec. V, we turn to the properly speaking weak turbulence framework by considering the case of a
large spectrum of waves. We focus on the small coupling limit, as a benchmark for the statistical mechanics of weak
Langmuir turbulence. We show that Monte Carlo microcanonical results fully agree with an exact microcanonical
derivation. We conclude by discussing the predicted time-asymptotic spectrum, its relation to quasilinear theory and
to a pending debate in theoretical, experimental and numerical plasma physics on the long time fate of the electric
ﬁeld for Landau damping.

II. CANONICAL ENSEMBLE

We shall start deriving statistical mechanics in the canonical ensemble and then use the equivalence between
canonical and microcanonical ensembles. Apart from the energy, it can be easily checked that the average total
momentum per particle, σ, is also conserved with

All the diﬃculty lies in the estimation of (13) for M > 1. We shall then ﬁrst restrict our discussion to the case where
only one mode is selected before going to the large-M case in the small-coupling limit in Sec. V. The M = 1 case
occurs naturally in the cold beam-plasma interaction [4, 10, 12, 14]. We get, for k = 1 and L = 2π,

III. THE SINGLE WAVE CASE: SATURATION OF THE COLD BEAM/PLASMA INTERACTION

A. Presentation

The analysis of O’Neil and Drummond et al.

[12, 13] have shown that, in the case of a monokinetic beam, only
a single wave, the wave having the largest growth rate, has a signiﬁcant interaction with the beam, at least up to
the ﬁrst trapping oscillations. We shall consider here this single wave case and retain one mode (M = 1) with rest
frequency ω0 = ωp and wave number k = 1. A simple linear analysis [12, 15] determines then which initial beam
streaming velocity vb leads to the maximal destabilization of this mode. This gives vb =
ωp and
associated maximal linear growth rate γL = 2−4/3√3η1/3ωp. This derivation is analogous to considering the more
realistic scenario where the initial cold beam velocity is given and determining the dominant mode, namely the mode,
among a continuum of modes, that is the most strongly destabilized. The expression of vb reveals the weakly resonant
nature of the linear instability: it concerns mostly particles having velocities not equal to the initial wave velocity but
about γL/k away from it [16]. Fig. 1 shows the time evolution of the wave intensity starting from an inﬁnitesimal
value. Nonlinear eﬀects, namely trapping of particles in the wave trough, stop the initial linear exponential growth.
Trapping oscillations coincide with the existence of a strong density inhomogeneity in the phase space. This is visible
on the phase space snapshot in Fig. 2.

We shall use the M = 1 cold beam instability [4] as a simple testbed for the Monte Carlo code. Let us then
ﬁrst derive the canonical ensemble average of the wave intensity in this case and look for an analytical estimate as a
function of the problem parameters and initial data.

Dynamical symplectic [3] simulations indicate that, after some trapping periods, the average wave intensity I/N scales
approximately as 0.78η1/3 [15]. For the parameter η chosen in Fig. 1, this gives
which is
indeed in agreement with the time average of ψ. The microcanonical Monte Carlo results plotted on the same Figure
show an excellent agreement with this time average. Canonical Monte Carlo results assuming U = N ε0 is in ﬁne
agreement with the analytical result (31). This is a practical way to bypass the microcanonical or time-asymptotic
evaluation of β and relate directly canonical results to initial data. Here this result shows a ten-per-cent discrepancy
with the exact microcanonical result. Moreover, we can equivalently express Eq. (31) in terms of the ratio between
the asymptotic trapping pulsation and the linear growth rate yielding

This is in agreement with the results of an early experiment by Mizuno and Tanaka [17] designed to test the single wave
model. A monoenergetic beam is injected along a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, making the system unidimensional,
into a plasma. In this electron gun, the mechanism of the nonlinear saturation of a nearly single wave is reported
through the ﬁrst measurement of the trapping of beam electrons. The approximate experimental value, given in Ref.
[17], of the ratio ωb/γL associated to the ﬁrst trapping pulsation is 0.83. As evidenced by Fig. 1, this can here be
used as a fairly good approximation of the asymptotic value ωb∗/γL. Yet, proceeding to a direct measure from the
data plotted on the Figure 1 of Ref. [17], we obtain a somewhat larger value for this quantity, slightly above 1.2 and
closer to the estimate (32).

Finally, it is interesting to note that an explicit low-dimensional modeling of the dynamics, along the lines of Ref. [4]
stressing the phase space division between the macroparticle and chaotic sea components, has been recently proposed
by Antoniazzi et al.
in the saturated regime of a single pass free electron laser around perfect tuning [18]. This
model uses an Hamiltonian formulation that is a direct counterpart of the present Hamiltonian single-wave particle
framework.

IV. LANDAU DAMPING OF A SINGLE WAVE: PHASE TRANSITION AND O’NEIL’S THRESHOLD

γL|

In Ref.

. On the contrary, if the nonlinear time τb0 is smaller than

[10], O’Neil considered the damping of a single wave interacting eﬀectively with a subset of resonant
particles. He proposed a qualitative dynamical threshold conditioning the time asymptotic behavior of the wave: if
−1 is far smaller than the initial nonlinear trapping time τb0 of the particles in the wave
the linear damping time
trough, then the wave should not have enough time to experience nonlinear eﬀects and should be completely damped
−1, the linear one, nonlinear eﬀects (trapping)
as t
should forever control the dynamics. This can be already inferred from a linear analysis. As already apparent in the
cold beam case, the particles controlling the linear regime are those quasi-resonant particles located at about γL/k
from ωp/k [16]: if those particles are trapped in the initial wave (with half resonance width 2ωb0) right away, then the
linear regime should be bypassed. However, this result is qualitative. Actually, in spite of major recent advances in
the analytical and computational ﬁelds [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], mostly in the full Vlasov-Poisson framework,
as well as in experiments [27], no deﬁnite answer presently exists to this intrinsically nonlinear and time-asymptotic
issue, in the sense that no quantitative threshold separating nonzero time-asymptotic wave amplitude states from zero
ones is known. This is basically due to the facts that analytical reductions of the problem should e.g. make some
restrictions on the asymptotic behavior of the electric ﬁeld whereas numerical and experimental investigations should
be obviously taken with great care when addressing the t
limit. For instance, the nice experiments recently
done in a trapped pure electron plasma [27] diagnose the ﬁrst trapping oscillation frequency ωb at the onset of the
nonlinear stage (and more precisely the dimensionless ratio γL/ωb) as a function of the initial ratio γL/ωb0 rather
than the, rigorously speaking, time-asymptotic state.

γL|

→ ∞

We shall consider here the single wave-particle interaction model that describes the eﬀective (ﬁeld envelope) dynam-
ics of the Vlasov-Poisson system in the case where only one wave exists. This is obviously an idealized or academic
situation, yet it is perfectly appropriate to discuss O’Neil’s picture. We shall show here that O’Neil’s threshold can
be related to a second order phase transition for the single wave self-consistent Hamiltonian model H N,1, with order
parameter the wave intensity ψ. This was already discussed in Ref. [8]. We shall however consider here speciﬁcally
the O’Neil setting, that is we take a given ﬁnite initial wave intensity ψ0 and a monotonously decreasing, linear, tail
particle distribution function f0(v), of which we shall vary the slope and thus the linear Landau damping rate γL
(See Fig. 3). Because of locality properties in the velocity space [30], the wave has an eﬀective interaction only with
particles that are not too far away from its separatrices. One can reasonably think that particles having velocities
more than, let’s say, 4ωb0/k away from ωp/k [30] should evolve on Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori for the
pendulum-like 1,5 degrees of freedom Hamiltonian (given by Eqs. (2)-(3) with (I(t), θ(t))) associated to H N,1, mate-

The righthand side of (38) is reminiscent of the scaling law of the growth rate of the cold beam. This inequality is
both a condition on the beam width and initial wave amplitude. In order to observe a regime in which the wave and
the particles are decoupled in the sense that I is no longer extensive (ballistic regime instead of trapping regime), it is
necessary to exclude the case of a cold beam. In this latter case, even if the initial wave amplitude is inﬁnitesimal, it
will not be completely damped: this signals the singular character of the cold beam/wave interaction. Eq. (38) means
that a wave interacting resonantly with a cold beam cannot be Landau damped to zero. Additionally, the condition
(38) thus speciﬁes what is meant by an ”initially ﬁnite” wave amplitude. The wave-particle interaction model `a la
O’Neil presented here rules out the classical research case of Landau damping in the limit of a perturbative wave
of inﬁnitesimal amplitude. The present framework is deﬁnitely non trivial since, if the wave is eﬀectively damped
asymptotically to zero, nonlinear eﬀects should place the study in the frame of Isichenko’s resolution [20] predicting
a very slow, asymptotically algebraic, damping.

Let us illustrate these results for values of ∆ and η allowing a phase transition in the canonical approach just

We can check that this value is very close to the threshold estimated in Ref. [8] in which the initial tail distribution
(close to, but not, linear), and thus the linear Landau damping rate, was given whereas the initial wave amplitude
was the control parameter. This agreement may be interpreted as an indicator of the robustness of the statistical
mechanics approach. Figs. 4 and 5 show the Monte Carlo microcanonical ensemble averages of the wave intensity
as a function of the slope of the initial tail distribution function and of the parameter q. A nice agreement with the
threshold (39) is found. The transition is emphasized by the logarithmic scale in Fig. 5, as in the asymptotic ballistic
regime, ψ scales as 1/N .

Using equilibrium statistical mechanics allows then to set in a quantitative way O’Neil’s threshold. However strong
metastability eﬀects and long relaxation times towards equilibrium in the vicinity of the phase transition [8] temper
the practical interest of this result, especially in the purely collisionless Vlasovian N
limit [11] for which there is
increasing evidence [7, 28, 29] that it may not commute with the t
limit. This explains that practical experimental
and numerical attempts to determine qc typically yield values that are about one order larger than (39). It should be
also remembered that, as demonstrated by Isichenko’s calculation [20], the asymptotic behavior of a damping electric
ﬁeld is intrinsically very slow, so very diﬃcult to detect and discriminate practically from a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal
(BGK) saturation stage [34]. Equilibrium statistical mechanics should prove however essential to address the large
time nonlinear fate of wave-particle interaction in the generic case of many waves. Strong resonances overlap may
then create large scale chaos inducing an eﬃcient sweeping of the phase space ensuring good ergodic properties or,
using the Lynden-Bell terminology, violent relaxation.

V. MICROCANONICAL PREDICTIONS FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF WAVES: THE
INFINITESIMAL COUPLING LIMIT

A. Motivations and Monte Carlo simulations

We shall consider here a regime for which the validity of quasilinear theory has been questioned [31, 32, 33], when
the nonlinear timescale (resonance broadening time τRB) is much lower than the linear one (of the order of the inverse
of the linear growth rate γL), that is µ
1. Equilibrium predictions are expected to be particularly
relevant for this problem since chaotic mixing and system ergodization should prove eﬀective typically on the nonlinear
timescale.

(τRBγL)−1

Let us begin by presenting microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations done for parameters very close to those used
by Doxas and Cary in Ref.
[32]. Speciﬁcally, the wave spectrum is composed of M = 584 waves, that are initially
strongly overlapping with a Chirikov overlap parameter of about 500, with wavenumbers between 2.78 and 3.70. The
strong overlap is needed to model a continuous spectrum. The beam distribution in velocity is the same as in Ref.
[32], chosen to give a constant linear growth rate across the spectrum: f0(v) = C1 + C2 (1
[va; vb]
and f0(v) = 0 otherwise, with C1 and C2 ﬁxed by normalization and the value of the growth rate. For the Monte
Carlo code, these particular initial conditions just ﬁx the two microcanonical constants of motion, namely the total
energy and momentum. Then, as detailed in the analysis of Ref. [32], the large-µ regime is entered as the coupling
(control) parameter η becomes vanishingly small. We are thus investigating here the small coupling regime. Results
may be summarized as follows:
in the transient stage of the Monte Carlo runs, that may be compared with some
care to the real time dynamics, one observes ”noisy” wave spectra that may be related to the spontaneous spectra

discretization reported in previous studies [32]. In the thermodynamical framework, this appears only as a transient
stage towards equilibration. The major point depicted by Fig. 6 is that the energy apparently tends to concentrate
at equilibrium into a very small number of small wavelength modes while the long wavelength wave intensities are no
longer extensive.

B. Exact microcanonical derivation

Let us consider analytically the small coupling limit, namely η

0+. This is a singular limit that amounts to
neglect (at zero order in η) the wave-particle interaction potential in the self-consistent Hamiltonian (1) while retaining
the total wave-particle momentum conservation constraint. In the microcanonical ensemble, the partition function
reads, with ω0j = ωp for any wave number j,

D. Discussion and conclusion

Considering a spectrum of waves, we have focused on the small coupling limit as a benchmark for the statistical
mechanics of weak Langmuir turbulence. A trivial correspondence, assuming the equivalence of ensembles, between
Eqs. (49) and (54), using (55), shows that electrons should, as time proceeds, escape from the original resonances
towards lower speeds. Meanwhile, the wave spectrum collapses towards short-wavelengths and the wave energy
eventually concentrates into the mode of minimal phase velocity, that basically matches plasma thermal velocity.
Consistently, particles (electrons) behaving almost freely loose their resonant character and follow the decay of waves
towards small velocities.

Let us then brieﬂy comment on the relation of these results with the investigation on the limits of quasilinear
theory undertaken by Doxas and Cary [32].
It is obviously uneasy to draw conclusions on the out-of-equilibrium
behavior, such as diﬀusion, from equilibrium statistical mechanics results. Some statements are still possible: When
the nonlinear timescale is far larger than the linear one, quasilinear theory is expected not to apply as the timescale
of validity of (almost) zero-order eﬀects, such as the reaction of the resonant wave spectrum on the zero-order
distribution function, becomes negligible. Actually, we infer from the equilibrium microcanonical results that, within
some nonlinear thermalization timescale, the initial particle distribution function is substantially modiﬁed whereas
the wave spectrum collapses towards the short wavelengths. The thermalization stage is expected to exhibit a noisy
wave spectrum, as in Monte Carlo transients, as the wave spectrum collapse proceeds through higher order wave-wave
couplings, which may explain the dynamical ﬁndings of diﬀusion enhancements [32].

Now, we can consider the small coupling results from a more general perspective. Let us consider an initial very weak
beam-plasma or bump-on-tail instability destabilizing some spectrum of waves towards suprathermal levels in a wave-
particle interaction dynamics captured by the self-consistent Hamiltonian (1). Then, the previous calculation predicts
that this out-of-equilibrium dynamics cannot sustain itself as the wave energy should drop and cascade towards
short-wavelengths with phase velocities reaching the plasma bulk thermal velocity. Obviously, the self-consistent
Hamiltonian model reaches at this point its validity limit. This behavior is an eﬀect of considering a spectrum of
modes rather than single modes, as in Secs. III and IV, for which trapping ensures the long-standing stabilization of
the instability.

Recently a pending debate emerged concerning the time-asymptotic state of a large amplitude Landau damped
wave [27]. It is commonly expected that the system will eventually enter some stationary BGK equilibrium with a
time-asymptotic ﬁnite wave amplitude provided the initial amplitude is large enough. This agrees with the statistical
mechanics predictions for a single wave derived in Sec. IV under the O’Neil setting. The existence of BGK steady
states is supported by some theoretical analysis and numerical results [21, 22, 23]. However, Brodin’s numerical
simulations [19] suggested that the wave amplitude never settles to a steady value as the energy of the resonant
particles diﬀuses slowly into higher harmonics. Moreover Isichenko [20] argued that nonlinearities should not stop the
damping of the electric ﬁeld towards a vanishing time-asymptotic amplitude. Our point of view here is that, within
the weak coupling hypothesis - that besides fully justiﬁes the linear response of the background plasma -, the Landau
damping of a spectrum of waves is predicted not to reach a BGK ﬁnite amplitude steady state with the resonant tail
electrons drifting with wave energy towards plasma bulk.

2 ion in dense Argon gas near the liquid–vapor critical point has been
The drift mobility of the O
measured as a function of the density. Near Tc the zero–ﬁeld density–normalized ion mobility µ0N
shows a deep minimum at a density smaller than Nc. This phenomenon was previously intepreted
as the result of the formation of a correlated cluster of Argon atoms around the ion because of the
strong electrostriction exerted by the ion on the highly polarizable and compressible gas. We now
suggest that a possible alternative explanation is related to the onset of a parametric resonance of
a bubble surrounding the ion. At resonance a large amount of energy is dissipated by sound waves
in addition to viscous dissipation processes, resulting in the large mobility drop observed.

The transport properties of negative ions in dense rare
gases and liquids have been recently subject of renewed
interest because they can give information on how the
microscopic structure of the ﬂuid around the ion is mod-
iﬁed by the ion–atom interaction [1,2]. Moreover, the
possibility to greatly change with relative ease the gas
density N close to the critical point of the liquid–vapor
transition gives the experimenters the unique opportu-
nity to investigate the transition from the kinetic to the
hydrodynamic transport regime [3].

The drift mobility of O

−
2 in dense Ne gas [2] or in liquid
Xe [4] can be satisfactorily explained in terms of hydro-
dynamics if ions are assumed to be surrounded by a com-
plex structure. The competition between short–range re-
pulsive exchange forces between the weakly bound outer
electron of the ion and the electrons of the atoms and
the long–range polarization attraction of the ion with the
atoms leads to the formation of a microcavity around the
ion, which is in turn surrounded by a strong density en-
hancement [1,5].

A self–consistent ﬁeld model has been developed to
compute the structure shape [5]. The size of the com-
plex is taken as eﬀective hydrodynamic radius R of the
ion and its drift mobility is calculated by means of the
Stokes formula µ0 = e/6πηR, where η is the viscosity.
−
The agreement with O
2 mobility data in liquid Xe [4] is
quite good, but the data in Ne gas near Tc [2] are almost
quantitatively reproduced only for N > Nc. In particu-
lar, the model does not reproduce even qualitatively the
little dimple in the density–normalized mobility µ0N for
N
0.7Nc. In this Letter we show that this general fea-
ture of the mobility [6] can be explained by assuming that
under certain termodynamic conditions a further dissi-
pation mechanism becomes active in addition to viscous
processes, namely sound wave emission by oscillations of
the structure surrounding the ion.

Since the inﬂuence of electrostriction on the structure
formation depends on the gas polarizability, we have car-
−
2 mobility measurements in Ar gas [7] because
ried out O

its polarizability is much larger than that of Ne. We used
the pulsed photoinjection technique as for Ne [2] and He
[3]. Details of the experiment are reported in literature
[8,9]. A small bunch of electrons is injected into the gas
by irradiating a photocathode by means of a short UV
light pulse. Electrons are captured by O2 impurities (in a

[10]. They drift under the action of an external electric
ﬁeld E towards the anode inducing a detectable current.
The analysis of its time dependence allows the determi-
nation of the drift time and, hence, of the drift velocity
vD [11]. Finally, the mobility is calculated as µ = vD/E.

0.5 is obtained
good agreement with the data for N/Nc ≥
by introducing into the eﬀective radius an adjustable con-
tribution proportional to the size of the strongly cor-
related cluster. Thus, the hydrodynamic radius shows
a complicated ad hoc density dependence, whose mean-
ing is not easy to grasp. The reason might be that this
model focuses only on the structure determined by the
long–range part of the ion–atom interaction potential and
does not take into account the presence of the microcav-
ity closely surrounding the ion. Therefore, it neglects
the possibility that the cavity may oscillate. In this case
the energy of the moving complex, ion plus structure or,
brieﬂy, ionic bubble, can be dissipated by sound wave ra-
diation in addition to viscous processes.

The present problem bears many aﬃnities with that of
the dynamics of electron bubble formation in liquid He
[12], the adiabatic process where the repulsive electron–
atom interaction displaces a large number of atoms far
away from the electron which is localized within the ﬂuid
dilation, or the electron solvation dynamics in water,
where cavity contraction is induced by long–range attrac-
tive polarization interactions [13]. These problems have
been treated in terms of a hydrodynamic model of cavity
expansion [12] or collapse [13]. The dynamics of the cav-
ity boundary is determined by the ﬂow of the surround-
ing solvent. This is assumed to be spherically symmetric
with velocity in the radial direction. In absence of energy
dissipation and by assuming the incompressibility of the
solvent, the cavity boundary velocity U is described by
the Rayleigh–Plesset (RP) equation

where R is the time dependent cavity radius, ρ is the
gas mass density, pe is the external pressure, and p(R) is
the pressure on the cavity boundary, expressed in terms
of the free energy change F in the process: p(R) =
(∂F/∂R) /4πR2. The equilibrium radius is obtained
−
by minimizing F, but in absence of dissipation the sys-
tem will not equilibrate. The cavity oscillates around
the equilibrium value of the radius. Energy dissipation
causes the damping of the oscillations. Within the given
approximations, the ﬁrst passage time, i.e., the time re-
quired for the cavity radius to expand (contract) from its
initial value to its maximum (minimum) is taken as the
lower bound for the relaxation timescale of the process.
Viscosity and emission of sound waves drive the system
towards the equilibrium [12,13].

It is obvious that also the drift motion of the ion is
aﬀected if energy is dissipated also by emission of sound
waves. We therefore address the issue of the motion of the
ionic bubble in dense Ar gas, considering the oscillations
of the bubble boundary. We assume a spherical cavity

with well–deﬁned boundary of radius R(t) with equilib-
rium value R0. The main contribution to the restoring
force is due to the surface tension. Although a gas has no
surface tension, the enhanced density region around the
cavity acts as a well–deﬁned interface. Oscillations are
initiated by collisions with energetic Ar atoms. Owing to
the bubble smallness and to the asimmetry induced by
the average motion driven by the external electric ﬁeld,
these collisions are not very frequent and occur in a spa-
tially non homogeneous way. The equation of motion of
the bubble boundary is then given by the RP equation,
and, beside the impulsive nature of the driving force, is
the same equation used for the bubble dynamics in the
sonoluminescence experiments [15].

So, for small distortion of the spherical shape a solution
for the bubble radius is sought in the form R0 + anYn,
where Yn is a spherical harmonic of degree n, and an
are the distortion amplitude coeﬃcients. As bubble os-
cillations are initiated by collisions with energetic Ar
atoms, this phenomenon can be basically described by
a kicked rotator model, with the following equation of
motion for the simple normalized periodic case: a′′

ger, Γ the damping constant and τ the period between

Imposing a stochastic behaviour to the po-
tential function, we can model collision events occurring
with a gaussian distribution, e.g. in the quantum kicked
rotator and electron localization problem [14]. All prop-
erties of this equation are well known results of nonlinear
dynamical system theory, which assure, under certain as-
sumptions, the existence of a universal route to chaos. In
the limit of small forcing the dynamics of the distortion
amplitude can be cast in the form of the Mathieu–Hill

For a dissipation–free system the Mathieu–Hill equa-
tion is known to give origin to parametric instability,
when deviations from the spherical shape accumulate

used to make a stability analysis of the bubble boundary

The factor 211 can be explained assuming that only colli-

initiate bubble oscillations. These energetic collisions are

problem there is a moving interface between media of
diﬀerent polarizability, crossed by the strong electrical
ﬁeld of the ion. Therefore, an experiment could be de-
signed to detect the expected quantum radiation emitted
as a dynamic Casimir eﬀect, that some authors consider
the physical cause of sonoluminescence [23].

Close to the critical point the sound velocity c is mini-
mum (
190 m/s [20]) and sound dissipation is favoured.
The sound intensity irradiated by an oscillating bubble
in the long wavelength limit is [21] I = 2πρcω2R4
0. At the
density of the minimum µ0N the intensity irradiated per
cycle is in the tens of meV range and a relevant part of
the energy gained by the ion from the electric ﬁeld is dis-
sipated by means of this process in addition to the usual
viscous processes. At higher N the stiﬀness of the bubble
surface becomes too large and the oscillations cannot be
initiated so easily as in the resonance region. Hence, at
high N the contribution of the sound to energy dissipa-
tion is limited and µ0 is determined by the viscosity. This
is why the high
N region µ0N can be well described by
the Stokes formula. On the contrary, at much lower N
bubbles cannot form and µ0N is determined by dissipa-
tion processes other than sound emission.

−

In the region where stable bubbles exist a further dis-
sipation mechanism, though probably very small, should
be considered. Within the bubble the ion undergoes a
chaotic motion bouncing back and forth from the inner
bubble wall. Molecular Dynamics studies [22] have shown
a vibration of the ion within the cavity. The ion should
therefore behave as an emitting antenna of characteristic
2πvth/2R0, where vth = (3kBT /mi)1/2

is the ion thermal velocity and mi its mass. At the ex-
1012 rad s−1. Moreover, this

The Child-Langmuir law is investigated numerically using a fully electromagnetic particle-in-cell
code for a closed axially symmetric diode. It is found that the average current transmitted to the
anode (JTR) increases with the injected current (JIN) even after the formation of virtual cathode in
1−β
both the non-relativistic and relativistic cases. The increase is found to be a power law, JTR ∼ J
IN .
In other words, the time averaged fraction f of electrons reaching the anode varies with the input
−1
current as, f ∼ J
IN . The
possibility of asymptotic saturation is also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Child-Langmuir law is the cornerstone of electron
ﬂow in diodes.
It gives the maximum current density,
JCL(1), that can be transported from an inﬁnite planar
cold cathode (velocity of emission is zero) at zero poten-
tial to an inﬁnite planar anode parallel to the cathode
at a distance D and potential V . In the non-relativistic
case, this is given by [1,2]

Here, e is the magnitude of the charge and m0 the rest
mass of an electron.

The Child-Langmuir law is a result of the space-charge
eﬀect. As electrons are emitted from the cathode, they
gain velocity from the imposed ﬁeld. At the same time,
they experience a repulsive force due to the presence
of other electrons. However, all the injected current is
transmitted to the anode as long as the injected current,
JIN, is less than a particular value, called the critical cur-
rent JCR. When JIN exceeds JCR, the net force is such
that some of the electrons, instead of moving towards
the anode, start moving backwards as if reﬂected from a
“virtual cathode”. As a result, only a part of the current,
JTR, is transmitted. The position of the virtual cathode
depends on JIN and on the initial velocity, v0, of the emit-
ted electrons. In one dimension, JCR = JCL(1) in case
of cold emission i.e.
in case v0 = 0. Also, the virtual
cathode is formed on the cathode as soon as the injected
current exceeds JCR and remains there even when JIN
is increased. The transmitted current JTR in this case
is the Child-Langmuir current JCL(1) for any value of
the injected current above JCR. The transition in the
transported current is therefore sharp: JTR = JIN if
JIN

JCR, JTR = JCR if JIN

JCR.

The ﬂow of current below the critical value is steady
i.e. time-independent, but is oscillatory above it. The
value of the critical current JCR is thus that value above
which the system does not have a steady state. This
criterion may be used to evaluate exact analytical ex-
pression for JCR in one-dimensional planar geometry in

≤

≥

case the kinetic energy of the electrons is non-relativistic.
The analytical expression for JCR may also be derived in
the ultra-relativistic limit.

Since, as mentioned above, the system does not ap-
proach any steady state if JIN > JCR, its behaviour for
the input currents exceeding the critical current is de-
scribed by time-dependent equations. However, it is not
possible to solve the time-dependent equations analyt-
ically exactly even in one-dimensional planar geometry
[3]. Solving time-dependent equations is avoided in the
so called classical theory which, for JIN > JCR, assumes
a steady state which takes account of reﬂections from
the virtual cathode. The one-dimensional planar model
is analytically exactly solvable within the framework of
the classical theory. In particular, it leads to the Child-
Langmuir law. Comparison with numerical work shows
that the predictions of the classical theory are close to
the time-averaged values of physical quantities.

Over the past decade, several studies have been carried
out to extend the Child-Langmuir law to two and higher
dimensions [4,5]. The motivation for this is twofold. In
the ﬁrst place, this helps to benchmark particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulation codes. More importantly, the existence
of a space charge limited saturation current implies that
one need not bother about the material dependent cath-
ode characteristics (the Richardson-Dushman law in case
of thermionic emission or the Fowler-Nordheim law [7] for
ﬁeld emission) so long as the injected current is more than
what gives rise to the limiting value of the transmitted
current. This condition considerably simpliﬁes the simu-
lation of devices that use a diode.

Most studies in two-dimensions have centred around
cold emission from a ﬁnite emission area in an other-
wise inﬁnite parallel plate geometry [4–6]. Note that the
Child-Langmuir current is deﬁned in these studies as the
current at which oscillatory behaviour sets in (the crit-
ical current, JCR ). Both numerical and analytical re-
sults indicate that this critical current in two-dimensions
(JCL(2)) is higher than the Child-Langmuir current in
one-dimension (JCL(1)). Further, there exists a relation
between the two [5]:

shown that the potential φ(z) at the plane at the position
z in that case is the solution of the Poisson equation

Here W is width of the emission strip, D is the anode-
cathode separation and a0
0.31. The question of limit-
≃
ing current (the maximum current transported across the
gap) has not however been investigated by these authors.
Recent experiments using photoemission from a cath-
ode have yielded some interesting results [8]. The experi-
ments show that it is possible to transport a much higher
current than that predicted by the one-dimensional law
for a short emission pulse or limited emitter area and
(more importantly) the current may be increased even
after formation of the virtual cathode. This leads to
a distinction between the critical current (the minimum
current required for virtual cathode formation) and the
limiting current.
In the range of laser intensity stud-
ied in these experiments, no limiting current (maximum
current that can be transported for a given potential dif-
ference and gap separation) was established although the
authors suggest the existence of an asymptote.

The question of limiting current in two and higher di-
mensions thus assumes a great signiﬁcance since its non-
existence in realistic situations can be a major stumbling
block in simulations. With this in mind, in this commu-
nication we investigate numerically the Child-Langmuir
law in an axially symmetric cavity. We demonstrate that,
for axially symmetric closed geometries with a ﬁnite emit-
ting area, (i) the current increases even after formation of
the virtual cathode, and (ii) the time-averaged fraction
−β
IN with
of electrons reaching the anode varies as f
β < 1 thereby establishing that the transmitted current,
JTR = f JIN, increases as a power law beyond the critical
current.

The plan of the paper is as follows: We ﬁrst review
the one-dimensional non-relativistic case and, within the
framework of the classical theory, show analytically that
above the critical current, the fraction of charges reaching
the anode varies inversely with the injected current (f
∼
−1
J
IN ). A similar study for the relativistic case is presented
next followed by our numerical results for inﬁnite planar
diode and axially symmetric cavity diode. Finally our
results are summarized in the concluding section. As a
matter of convenience, we shall use the notations J, v
and ρ to refer to the magnitude of the current density,
velocity and charge density respectively.

0 = 1
eφ(0) is the initial energy of an electron at

In the steady state, E0(t) = E0(t0) and ∂E0/∂t = 0.
Also, using the fact that below the critical current, no

where α = 27V 3/2/4β, T = T /T0, T0 = D/(2m0/eV )1/2

time in the absence of space charge. The condition that
all the roots of (14) be real may be shown to be α > 27/4.
For α < 27/4, two of the roots are complex while one
root is real. The real root is however negative and hence
inadmissible as a transit time. Thus α = 27/4 marks the
critical current. On substituting the values of α and β,
the expression for the critical current is found to be given

cathode vanishes.

The above analysis holds good for JIN

JCR where
the injected and transmitted currents are equal. Beyond
the critical current, electrons are reﬂected and the anal-
ysis breaks down.
In order to ﬁnd out what happens
beyond the critical current, it is useful to consider yet
another steady state model which assumes that a frac-
tion f of the injected electrons is transmitted while the
f is reﬂected at some point z = zm so that
fraction 1
the transmitted current is JTR = f JIN [2,11]. Though we
have assumed so far that the total energy
0 of an elec-
tron entering the diode is zero, it is instructive to carry
the classical theory for injected currents greater than the
critical currents for the case of non-zero
0. To that end,
on invoking the discussion following Eq.(4), the Poisson

at cathode vanishes. Hence, assuming dφ(z)/dz = 0 at
z = 0 and invoking also the boundary condition (30) at
z = 0, the integration of (29) gives

Note that this value of the transmitted current is inde-
pendent of the injected current and that this expression
holds as long as the injected current exceeds the critical
current. Eq. (27) is thus the limiting current that can
ﬂow through the diode. Note also that the limiting cur-
rent (27) is identical to the critical current JCR given in
(15).

It should be emphasized that the steady state model
for JIN > JCR is phenomenological. As is revealed by
the numerical solution of the time-dependent equations
for injected currents above JCR, the behaviour of the
system is oscillatory i.e.
it does not approach a steady
state. However, the steady state values derived above are
found to be in close agreement with the time-averaged
values of the numerical results.

III. CRITICAL AND LIMITING CURRENTS:
ONE-DIMENSIONAL RELATIVISTIC CASE

Finding an explicit expression for the critical current
in case of relativistic electronic energies is generally a
formidable task. However, an analytical expression for
the critical current may be derived in the ultrarelativistic
limit in case the initial velocity of the electrons is zero
if, following the results of the non-relativistic treatment,
we identify the critical current for zero initial velocity
as the one for which the electric ﬁeld at the cathode is
zero. We will see that, as in the non-relativistic limit,
this current is the same as the limiting current predicted
by the classical theory for relativistic energies.

A. Critical Current

The expression for the critical current in the relativis-
tic case may be derived more conveniently by starting
from the Poisson equation (4). The charge density ρ in
(4) is determined by ρv = JIN and v by the relativistic
energy conservation law

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

As in the non-relativistic case, we assume that when
JIN > JCR, the steady state is characterized by a frac-
tion f of particles transmitted beyond the position zm
at which the velocity becomes zero so that the current
in the region between the cathode and the position zm
consists of two parts, the injected current density JIN
moving away from the cathode to the virtual cathode at
zm and the reﬂected part (1
f )JIN moving to the cath-

ode from the virtual cathode. The Poisson equation in
the two regions can then be written as

the same as the limiting current. Note from (42) that the

The 1-D electrostatic analysis reviewed above indi-
cates that, for cold emission, the critical and limiting
currents are identical in both non-relativistic and rela-
tivistic cases. The chief motivation of this study is to
investigate whether this holds in higher dimension. To
this end, we shall use the fully electromagnetic particle-
in-cell code, SPIFFE [14], and limit ourselves to axially
symmetric diodes. For completeness and comparison, we
shall ﬁrst present our numerical results for 1-dimension.

A. One-Dimension: Sheet Model

In practical terms, the 1-dimensional analysis applies
when the cathode and anode are parallel plates of di-
mensions much larger than the separation between them
with uniform emission from the surface of the cathode.
A description, convenient for numerical calculations, is
to discretize continuous electronic ﬂuid as sheets of uni-
form charge density parallel to the surface of the two
electrodes [3]. The sheets move in the direction perpen-

This equation takes into account the electrostatic re-
pulsion between the sheets. Here zk = zk/D is the
scaled position of the kth sheet, βk = vk/c, αrel =
4πJIND2(9e/2m0c3)(c/v0)3, v0 is the initial velocity, N
is the number of sheets launched per unit transit time in
the absence of space charge and M is the total number
of sheets present in the diode at any instant of time.

For the numerical calculations presented here, the in-
tegration time step ∆t is D/(200v0), D = 0.8 cm while
N = 2000 for non-relativistic calculations (V = 250 kV)
and N = 10000 for relativistic calculations (V = 2 MV).
These parameters were chosen to satisfy convergence re-
quirements.

As stated before, the system approaches a steady state
if the injected current is below its critical value whereas
the solution is oscillatory for currents above that value.
Since the classical theory is based on the assumption of a
steady state even above the critical current, we compare
it with the time-averaged behaviour of the physical quan-
tities if the injected current is above the critical current
[17].

Fig. 1 is a plot of the transmitted current averaged over
10ns as a function of the injected current for V = 250
kV. It is clear that JTR attains saturation at JIN =
4.3 MA/m2. In order to quantify the saturation, we have
studied the (time averaged) fraction f of electrons reach-
ing the anode as a function of the injected current. Ac-

B. Axially Symmetric Diode: PIC

For the axially symmetric diode, the numerical calcu-
lations were performed using the fully electromagnetic
particle-in-cell code SPIFFE [14]. The basic algorithm is
described below [15].

1. Create the computational mesh and assign metal or
vacuum points according to the geometry speciﬁed
in the input ﬁle.

2. Evaluate imposed ﬁelds due to potentials applied

on metal surfaces

3. Inject macroparticles with speciﬁed charge and ve-

locity using the “over-injection” method.

4. Distribute the charge and velocity to the mesh

points using a standard weighting scheme.

5. Solve Maxwell’s curl equations with the speci-
ﬁed boundary conditions (Dirichlet/Neumann) us-
ing the Finite Diﬀerence Time Domain (FDTD)
method.

6. Find forces at the position of the particles by inter-
polating the ﬁeld values at the adjacent grid points.

7. Using these forces, ﬁnd new position and momen-

tum of the particles.

8. Remove particles that reach the end of the simula-

tion region or hit a metal surface.

9. Repeat 1 to 8.

After a speciﬁed number of time steps, it checks if
Poisson’s equation is satisﬁed within a speciﬁed “error
charge”. If not, it corrects the electric ﬁeld after solving
Poisson’s equation using the error charge.

The geometry of the diode consists of a hollow cylinder
of radius 12.5 cm with the cathode and anode plates of
radius 12.5 cm placed on either end with a separation
D = 0.8 cm between them. The cylinder and anode plate
are connected and maintained at a potential, V . The
cathode plate (on the left in ﬁg. 4) is grounded and the
emitting area is restricted to a radius R=3.5 cm. In each
case, the integration time step was chosen to be 0.0002
ns. Convergence was checked against the mesh spacings
in r and z as well as the charge per macro-particle.

A similar study for a relativistic case (2 MV) leads
us to an identical conclusion - the transmitted current

Fig. 12. The power law behaviour can be seen from a
plot of ln(f ) vs ln(JIN) (Fig. 13) and for this particular

relativistic case, there is a strong pinching eﬀect due to

1-dimensional prediction (80 MA/m2).

These results do not preclude the existence of asymp-
totic saturation. Rather, a ﬁt of JTR using the form
JSAT
IN provides a marginally better ﬁt than
the power law. However, a unique set of values for
(JSAT, A, γ) is hard to determine with the existing data
as several sets exist with nearly the same error (sum of
squares). Nevertheless, it is clear from these studies that
JTR does not saturate for ﬁnite values of injected currents
beyond the critical value.

We now present the central result of this communica-
tion. For the non-relativistic studies, the potential con-
sidered was 250 kV for which JCL(1) = 4.57 MA/m2
and JCL(2) = 1.0354 JCL(1) = 4.73 MA/m2. The in-
jected current was varied in the range 0
JIN < 100.
While criticality sets in at around JCL(1), there appears
to be no saturation in this range (see Fig. 10). While

creases as a power law beyond the critical current. This

V. CONCLUSIONS

[16] For the non-relativistic equation of motion, see [3].
[17] In each case, time averaging is performed after eliminat-

ing transients.

The existence of a limiting current in an axially sym-
metric cavity diode has been investigated.
It is found
that JTR does not saturate with an increase in JIN be-
yond the critical value characterised by the onset of re-
ﬂection. This is unlike the case of one-dimensional diode
which exhibits saturation of JTR as soon as JIN exceeds
JCR. Our main result is the power law behaviour, es-
tablished through numerical computations between the
transmitted current JTR and ﬁnite values of the in-
jected current JIN in an axially symmetric diode oper-
ating above the critical current JCR. The exponent de-
pends on the voltage. We have also explored the pos-
sibility of asymptotic saturation and found that there
exist sets of parameters (JSAT, A, γ) for which the form
A/J γ
JTR = JSAT
IN provides a marginally better ﬁt than
the power law JTR

IN.

The ﬁndings here thus have an important bearing on
numerical simulations which generally assume saturation
of transmitted current even in two-dimensional diodes at
a ﬁnite value of the injected currenbt. Analytical and nu-
merical studies of a one-dimensional diode have also been
presented for the sake of comparison and completeness.

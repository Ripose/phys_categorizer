Abstract

We study the long time behavior of light particles, e.g. an electron swarm in which

Coulomb interactions are unimportant, subjected to an external ﬁeld and elastic collisions

with an inert neutral gas. The time evolution of the velocity and position distribution

function is described by a linear Boltzmann equation (LBE). The small ratio of electron to

neutral masses, ǫ, makes the energy transfer between them very ineﬃcient. We show that

under suitable scalings the LBE reduces, in the limit ǫ

0, to a formally exact equation for

→

the speed (energy) and position distribution of the electrons which contains mixed spatial

and speed derivatives. When the system is spatially homogeneous this equation reduces

to and thus justiﬁes, for ǫ small enough, the commonly used “two-term” approximation.

Introduction

The motion of an electron under the inﬂuence of an external electric ﬁeld and elastic

“collisions” with the “background” is a problem of both historic and contemporary interest.

It arises in gas discharges in the laboratory and in the atmosphere, when the degree of

ionization is so low that electron-electron and electron-ion interactions are negligible, the

so called swarm approximation [Carron 1992, Allis 1956, Franklin 1976, Margenau and

Hartman 1948]. Similar situations arise in the study of electron transport in solids in a

semi-classical regime [Lorentz 1916, Sommerfeld 1956, Ben Abdolllah and Degon 1996, Ben

Abdolllah et al 1996, Golse and Poupaud 1992]. In such situations it is often reasonable

to treat the scatterers as if they were in thermal equilibrium. For electrons moving in

a (almost) neutral gas with constant density ρ this corresponds to the atoms having a

Maxwellian velocity distribution F (V; M ) at a speciﬁed temperature T,

F (V; M ) =

where M is the mass of the scatterers, e.g. the neutral atoms in a noble gas, k is the

Boltzmann constant, and d is the space dimension.

The time evolution of the electron distribution function is then given by a linear

Boltzmann equation (LBE) of the form [Franklin 1976, Landau and Lifshits 1993],

K

where e, m are the charge and mass of an electron, E is the external ﬁeld and K gives the

rate for scattering. The transition rate K will depend on the nature of the scatterers but,

for the case of elastic collisions, to which we restrict ourselves here, K will satisfy detailed

2

balance with respect to a Maxwellian velocity distribution for the electrons F (v; m), at the

same temperature as that of the neutrals, so that K(v, v′)F (v′; m) = K(v′, v)F (v; m).

This ensures that for E = 0, F (v; m) is a stationary velocity distribution which will be

approached by f (v, t) as t

; f (v, t) is obtained from f (r, v, t) by integrating over the

→ ∞

spatial coordinate r. We assume for simplicity that the electrons are conﬁned to a large

periodic box: f is then a probability density with

f (r, v; t)drdv = 1. It is also possible

to consider other boundary conditions as well as electric and magnetic ﬁelds which are

R R

space and time dependent, but we shall not do so here. We shall also not consider here

explicitly electrons in solids for which the scatterers are various kind of excitations [Ben

Abdolllah and Degon 1996, Ben Abdolllah et al 1996, Golse and Poupaud 1992].

The central physical fact about the electron-neutral system is the great disparity in

their masses: m

M = ǫ < 10−

4. Consequently the change in the speed of an electron in a

typical collision, which is of order √ǫ, will be very small, while the change in the velocity

direction will be large, becoming independent of ǫ when ǫ

0 [Franklin 1976, Landau and

→

Lifshits 1993]. This suggests approximating the integral operator in (2) by expanding the

right side of (2) in powers of ǫ and dropping “small terms” in ǫ. There is a certain amount

of ambiguity in carrying out such an expansion, arising from the uncertainty of how to

treat the dependence of the unknown f on ǫ. A reasonable choice gives

section, see [Margenau and Hartman 1948, Ginzburg and Gurevich 1960]. The dependence

of f on ǫ is then to be determined from the solution of (3).

3

There is, however, very little control over this expansion. In fact eq.(3) is not necessar-

ily positivity preserving. Nevertheless eq.(3) yields reasonable answers for the stationary

velocity distribution of the electrons, ¯f (v). The latter can be obtained explicitly in the

so-called “two-term” approximation [Lorentz 1916, Margenau and Hartman 1948, Allis

1956, Carron 1991], in which one keeps only the ﬁrst two terms in a spherical harmonic

expansion of ¯f (v). This distribution was ﬁrst found by Druyvesteyn [Druyvesteyn 1930,

Druyvesteyn and Penning 1940], who considered the case T = 0, σ = const, and was later

generalized by Davydov [Davydov 1935] for all T and σ. For an analysis of the error made

by the two term approximation to (3) see [Rokhlenko and Lebowitz 1997, Rokhlenko -

submitted].

A somewhat diﬀerent approach to this problem was taken by Koura [Koura 1987].

Starting with a two term ǫ-expanded kinetic equation (slightly diﬀerent than what is

obtained from (3)) he observed, that after a scaling of space, time and electric ﬁeld and

neglecting the time variation of the ﬁrst harmonic, one is led to an equation in which ǫ

does not appear at all. Koura then argued that the actual physical quantities of interest in

an electron swarm should have a similar simple scaling dependence on ǫ, when ǫ is small.

This has the advantage of permitting more eﬃcient computer simulations at larger than

realistic value of ǫ. Doing simulations for several values of ǫ Koura found good agreement

with results from the scaled two term approximation for ǫ<
∼

10−

2.

In this note we shall use the same scaling as Koura but apply it directly to (2) without

any other approximation. This is in the same spirit as the scalings used for electrons in

solids [Ben Abdolllah and Degon 1996, Ben Abdolllah et al 1996, Golse and Poupaud

4

1992]. It is based on a formulation of space-time scalings now commonly used to obtain

a “reduced hydrodynamic description” from a more detailed microscopic one, see [Spohn

1995].

One-dimensional problem

To simplify matters we shall ﬁrst consider the one dimensional version of (2), corre-

To obtain the behavior of f for long times we rescale our variables by setting y = √ǫx,

τ = ǫt (diﬀusive scaling [Spohn 1995]) and E = √ǫE∗ (the ﬁeld has to be small on this

scale for the energy to remain bounded when the time is of order ǫ−

1). We now deﬁne the

even and odd parts of the velocity distribution function

In previous works [Rokhlenko and Lebowitz 1997, Rokhlenko - submitted] we estab-

lished bounds on the ﬁrst few moments of the stationary distribution function using the

approximate equation (3) with a velocity independent total cross section σ0. Here we shall

do the same for the LBE (2) when T = 0. Introducing the dimensionless variables,

and noting that for T = 0, F (V; M ) = δ(V), the stationary, spatially homogeneous, f

satisﬁes, in d = 3, the equation,

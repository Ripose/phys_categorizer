The possibility to use the ultrashort ion bunches produced by circularly polarized laser pulses to
drive a source of fusion neutrons with sub-optical cycle duration is discussed. A two-side irradiation
of a thin foil deuterated target produces two countermoving ion bunches, whose collision leads to an
ultrashort neutron burst. Using particle-in-cell simulations and analytical modeling, it is evaluated
−2, more than 103 neutrons per Joule may be produced
that, for intensities of a few 1019 W cm
within a time shorter than one femtosecond. Another scheme based on a layered deuterium-tritium
target is outlined.

With the advent of short-pulse laser systems yielding
multi-terawatt power, laser-driven nuclear physics has
emerged as a very active area of research [1] with applica-
tions such as radioactive isotope production and nuclear
transmutation of elements. In particular, the emission of
neutrons from fusion reactions has been observed in sev-
eral experiments with diﬀerent pulse parameters and tar-
get types, including solid targets [2], heavy water droplets
[3], deuterium clusters [4, 5], and underdense plasmas or
gas jets [6]. In these experiments, the number of neutrons
produced per Joule of the laser pulse energy is roughly in
−1 range for terawatt, femtosecond lasers,
the 104
and higher for large petawatt, picosecond lasers (see ta-
ble I of Ref.[5] for a partial summary). While the large
neutron ﬂuxes produced by petawatt pulses are of im-
portance for material damage studies relevant to ther-
monuclear fusion research [7], neutron bursts produced
by “table-top terawatt” (T3) lasers at high repetition
rate may provide compact, pulsed neutron sources for
radiography and other applications.

Neutron emission also provides a diagnostic for the
physics of laser-plasma interaction. The interpretation of
the above experiments suggests that, as a general issue,
the route to neutron production starts from the heat-
ing of target electrons up to high energies; in turn, the
electrons lead to space-charge ﬁelds driving ion acceler-
ation up to MeV energies (via various mechanisms such
as sheath acceleration in solid targets, or Coulomb explo-
sion in clusters and underdense plasma channels); ﬁnally,
collisions between ions lead to fusion reactions and neu-
tron emission. The duration of the latter could not be
measured so far in experiments; however, based on the
physical picture which is inferred from the experiments,
we expect the neutron pulse duration not to be shorter
than the laser pulse duration.

In the present Letter, we study a new approach to neu-
tron production by ultrashort laser pulses, which could
provide a source of fusion neutrons with sub-optical cy-
cle duration. This represents another possible route to
the ultrafast control and imaging of nuclear reactions by

∼

superintense ﬁelds [8] and may be used to study phenom-
ena such as nuclear spin-mixing oscillations whose period
was estimated to be

1 fs [9].

Our approach is based on the prediction that the irra-
diation of a solid targets with circularly polarized, intense
short pulses leads to the prompt acceleration of high-
density, short duration ion bunches [10], without gen-
eration of high-energy electrons. Such bunches may be
used as projectiles for beam fusion, since for deuterium
the energy in the center-of-mass system may approach
the Gamow value (
1 MeVmr/mp, where mr is the
reduced mass) for which the cross sections of deuterium-
deuterium (D-D) or deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions
have a maximum. With an appropriate target scheme,
fusion reactions and related neutron emission may last
just for a time of the order of the ion bunch duration,
which may be less than one optical cycle.
To ﬁnd a scheme based on the D + D

3He + n re-
action (which yields 2.45 MeV neutrons) aiming at the
shortest achievable duration, we consider a symmetri-
cal, double-sided irradiation of a thin foil target. In this
scheme, two colliding ion bunches are generated. Thus,
if the two bunches are properly timed, for a given value
of the laser intensity the energy in the center-of-mass
is maximized while the duration of neutron emission is
minimized. This experimental geometry is very simi-
lar to the one of Ref.[11], where a “laser-conﬁned” ther-
monuclear fusion approach, based on the compression of
a thin deuterium-tritium foil by double-side irradiation,
was proposed. To this aim, the use of circularly polarized
pulses is likely to be due to the need to avoid the produc-
tion of fast electrons whose pressure might be detrimental
for the foil conﬁnement and stability. In our scheme, to
produce two single bunches the laser pulse duration must
be much shorter (a few cycles) than in Ref.[11]. Our ap-
proach is based on a non-thermal beam fusion concept
with emphasis on the ultrashort duration of the neutron
emission, and without concerns of target stability.

It thus appears that a very thin target is needed. To this
aim, deuterated plastic, e.g. (CD2)n, looks more suitable

We now analyze the double-sided irradiation of a thin
foil using a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. As shown
in Ref.[10] a one-dimensional (1D) model is adequate to
keep the essential features of ion bunch generation. This
allows us to use a very ﬁne spatial and temporal reso-
lution, which is actually necessary to resolve the bunch
formation properly, since the latter is characterized by
sharp density gradients and very short formation times.
In our simulations we use 2000 grid cells per wavelength
and 2000 particles per cell at the initial time. In addition,
to compute the neutron yield from the simulation data
(as shown below) properly, the ion distribution function
has to be reconstructed over a phase space grid once ev-
ery a few timesteps.

Figure 1 shows results for a “D” foil simulation. The

after crossing each other, propagate in a low-density shelf
of ions which originate from the layer of charge depletion
at the surface and have been accelerated to lower energies
than the bunch ions (see Fig.1 and Ref.[10]). Actually,
at higher intensities the ions in the shelf have enough en-
ergy to sustain a signiﬁcant rate of fusion reactions during
the propagation of the bunch, leading to a higher yield
but also to a much longer duration (several femtosec-
onds) of the neutron emission. The order of magnitude

rate may be comparable or even higher.

To check our numerical results, and to provide an ap-
proximate scaling of the neutron yield versus the laser
intensity, we analytically evaluate the fusion rate in the
colliding-bunches scheme. From Ref.[10] we infer that
it is worth to consider for the ion bunch velocity dis-
tribution f (vi) either a “ﬂat-top” velocity distribution
fF = 1/vm for 0 < vi < vm and zero elsewhere, and a
vm). In both
monochromatic distribution fD = δ(vi −
cases the relative velocity distribution g(v) is easily ob-
tained analytically by convolution. The averaged reac-
tivity may thus be written as

FIG. 2: Numerical evaluation of the rate (solid line) and the
total number (dotted line) of neutrons produced per unit sur-
face for the “D” simulation of Fig.1 (left panel) and for the
“CD2” simulation for which ne = 250nc, aL = 8.

From the PIC simulation data we obtain g(v) at any
grid point by computing the ion velocity distribution
f (vi) on a phase space grid, from which g(v) is obtained
by convolution. We thus compute the reactivity and,
from the knowledge of the ion density, the number of
fusion reactions per unit density and time at each grid
point. Finally, we obtain the total rate of fusion events
and the overall number of neutrons produced by integrat-
ing R over space.

The results are shown in Fig.2 for both the “D” and
“CD2” target cases. The same number density of deu-
terium ions has been assumed.
In both cases, a neu-
tron burst with an ultrashort duration of about 0.7 fs
(FWHM) is generated. The relatively long-lasting tail in
the fusion rate is due to the fact that the two bunches,

In conclusion, we investigated the production of fusion
neutrons using ion bunches accelerated in solid deuter-
ated targets by circularly polarized laser pulses. Our re-
sults, in connection with the continuous progress in pro-
ducing ultrashort, superintense laser pulses at a high rep-
etition rate, may open a perspective for a neutron source
with sub-optical cycle duration and suﬃcient brightness
for applications.

yield increases, but the sub-cycle duration is lost.

A possibly simpler approach to a femtosecond neutron
source may be based on a single short pulse impinging on
a layered target with a thin surface layer of deuterium for
ion acceleration and an inner tritium layer to produce
neutrons at 14 MeV via the reaction D + T
α + n.

The measurement of the neutron burst duration is a

ment based on the interaction of the neutrons with a
secondary target, where charged particles are produced;

polarization as the main pulse . In this scheme, the interference pattern formed during the collision
between the pulses pre-accelerates electrons that are then trapped in the wakeﬁeld. Numerical
simulations of this process performed with a new Particle-in-Cell code are presented here. The results
show the nature of the injection mechanism and explain some striking features found experimentally,
such as the dependence of beam energy with the collision position and the reduction of the charge
at high energies. Simulations reproduce well the main features of the experimental observations.

The ﬁeld of laser-plasma wakeﬁeld acceleration has
known a fast development over the past few years.
In
this approach, particles are accelerated in the relativistic
plasma wave excited by an intense laser propagating in a
underdense plasma. Electric ﬁelds in the wake can reach
some hundreds of GeV/m instead of the tens of MeV/m
attainable in conventional RF accelerators, opening the
door to a new generation of compact particle accelera-
tors. Up to now, a single laser beam was responsible
for the injection and subsequent acceleration of the elec-
trons [2, 3, 4, 5]. Very recently, the external injection of
electrons in the wakeﬁeld using a second laser beam has
been demonstrated [1]. Electron beams obtained in this
manner are quasi-monoenergetic, tuneable and stable.

The idea of using a second laser to inject the elec-
trons was proposed years ago [6], and further developed
in the scheme implemented in the experiments [7].
In
this version, two counterpropagating laser pulses with
the same wavelength λ0 and polarization are used. The
ﬁrst pulse (the pump pulse), with normalized amplitude
a0 > 1, creates a wakeﬁeld. The second pulse (the injec-
tion pulse), with normalized amplitude a1 < 1, collides
with the pump pulse. During the collision, a laser beat-
wave pattern with phase velocity vbw ≈ 0 is formed [7].
The scale of the beatwave pattern is λ0/2, therefore the
ponderomotive force of the beatwave Fbw ∝ 2a0a1/λ0
is very large. This very large ponderomotive force pre-
accelerates electrons. A fraction of them is then trapped
in the wakeﬁeld (depending on the values of a0 and a1)
and subsequently accelerated to relativistic energies.

dynamics issues,
including self-focusing [10] and self-
compression [11] of the pump pulse as well as a correct de-
scription of the electric radial wake ﬁeld and beam load-
ing eﬀects. In previous studies these eﬀects were absent
or not well described due to the use of low dimensions.

In order to deal with this problem without a full three-
dimensional kinetic simulation, we have developed a new
Particle-in-Cell code with an hybrid cylindrical-geometry
scheme. Maxwell equations are written in axisymmet-
ric cylindrical coordinates (r, z), with z the direction of
propagation of the laser beams. Particles evolve in tridi-
mensional space. To calculate the sources of the Maxwell
equations (the density n(r, z) and the current j(r, z)),
tridimensional particle information, i.e. position (x, y, z)
and velocity (vx, vy, vz), is projected over the (r, z) grid.
The laser pulses are not described as ordinary electro-
magnetic ﬁelds but via their envelope, a(r, z). Each laser
beam is taken as a monochromatic plane wave of fre-
quency ω0 and wavenumber k0 = ω0/c modulated by the
envelope amplitude a(r, z). To calculate the laser elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld over a given particle, we interpolate
the amplitudes of the pump and injection beams (ai
0 and
ai
1 respectively) from the grid over the particle position
(x, y, z), and multiply this by the high-frequency compo-
nent. If both pulses are counterpropagating and linearly
polarized in ˆx, the normalized electric and magnetic laser
ﬁelds are given by

Previous numerical studies of colliding pulse injection
deal with ﬂuid descriptions of the plasma (valid for nor-
malized laser amplitudes a0 < 1) and test particle treat-
ment for the injected electrons [8], or one-dimensional
kinetic simulations [9]. We will show that a realistic
description of the process requires to include 3D beam

with φ0 and φ1 arbitrary phases, that we set to zero.
Note that the high-frequency laser ﬁeld is not calculated
over the grid but over each particle, so that the mesh size
can be larger than 1/k0, reducing drastically the compu-
tational cost. On the other hand, the timestep is limited
by 1/ω0. When the pulses do not overlap, the wakeﬁeld

created by each laser beam is similar to the one obtained
using the ponderomotive force F ∝ ∇|a(r, z)|2, i.e. the
wakeﬁeld is axially symmetric. Therefore, the assump-
tion of axial symmetry constitutes a valid approximation.
However, the inspection of electrons trajectories during
the beatwave shows that the symmetry is partially bro-
ken in the collision region. The spatial distribution of
electrons trapped in the vicinity of the laser pulse also
exhibits a degree of asymmetry [12]. We will discuss later
the importance of this lack of symmetry.

The pump pulse envelope is calculated using the enve-
lope equation given in [13]. The injection pulse is slightly
self-focused (the maximum amplitude is a1 ≈ 0.6 in-
stead of a1 = 0.4). For the sake of numerical simplic-
ity, we have neglected self-focusing of the injection pulse
and have considered that it is the analytical solution of
the envelope equation in vacuum. This is justiﬁed be-
cause simulations show that injection is weakly depen-
dent on the amplitude of the injection pulse in the range
a1 = 0.4 − 0.7.

Parameters of the simulations we have performed cor-
respond to the experiments recently performed at LOA
[1]. The pump laser energy is 700 mJ, λ0 = 2π/k0 =
0.8 µm, pulse duration 30 fs and spot size FWHM 16 µm,
corresponding to an intensity I = 3.4 × 1018 W/cm2, a
normalized amplitude a0 = 1.25 and a Rayleigh length
zR = 1.5 mm. The injection pulse energy is 250 mJ,
λ0 = 0.8 µm, pulse duration 30 fs and spot size FWHM
30 µm, corresponding to I = 4 × 1017 W/cm2, a1 = 0.4
and zR = 4 mm. The plasma density proﬁle (ﬁgure 1)
is close to the experimental one. The evolution of the
pump beam amplitude as the beam propagates along the
plasma is shown in ﬁgure 1. The beam propagates from
left to right and its focal plane is at z = −750 µm (the
center of the jet is at z = 0). The focal amplitude in vac-
uum (a0 = 1.25) is indicated by the horizontal straight
line. As we can see, the pump beam start being self-
focused in the density ramp at the beginning of the jet,

reaching a maximum of a0 ≃ 3.4 at z = −300 µm. From
this point, the beam diverges and it is again self-focused
in the second half of the jet. The density in the exit
ramp of the jet is too low to counter beam diﬀraction.
The pulse is also self-compressed, reaching a duration of
about 20 fs at the exit.

Simulations made without the injection beam indicate
the existence of a small degree of self-injection. The
spectrum of self-injected electrons is ﬂat between 20 and
300 MeV , with a total charge of ≃ 7 pC. Electrons are
trapped far from the laser, beyond the third wake period.
When an injection beam with parallel polarization is
included, a fraction of the electrons present during the
beatwave between the pulses is trapped in the wakeﬁeld,
its total charge ranging between 50 pC and 200 pC. Most
of the electrons are trapped in the bubble (we use the
term “bubble” to refer to the ﬁrst bucket of the wake-
ﬁeld structure, although in the present study laser inten-
sities are not high enough to reach the bubble regime),
and they contribute to the energy spectrum as a high
energy narrow peak (ﬁgure 2). When the polarizations
are crossed, it is also possible to trap some electrons, al-
though the high energy peak disappears and the charge
is divided by ∼ 3. These electrons are grouped in sev-
eral bunches and they are far from the laser (the closest
bunch is in the fourth wake period). The energy spec-
trum is broad, with several peaks corresponding to elec-
trons trapped in diﬀerent bunches (ﬁgure 2). A similar
trend has been observed in the experiments, i.e. spec-
tra with a high energy peak for parallel polarization and
lower charge multi-peaked or wide spectra for cross po-
larization (inset in ﬁgure 2). A good agreement between
simulation and experiment is found. However, the charge
is slightly overestimated in the simulations as well as the
relative energy spread.

The trapped charge for parallel polarization is small

compared with predictions made by previous models [8].
The reason of this low charge is that the beatwave is
strong enough to locally destroy the wakeﬁeld. Most
of the particles that were pre-accelerated by the beat-
wave are not trapped simply because during the colli-
sion, there is no accelerating nor radial ﬁeld to trap them.
Only the electrons accelerated at the end of the collision
reach the pulse back late enough to ﬁnd a newly gener-
ated wakeﬁeld structure. Figure 3 illustrates this phe-
nomenon. It shows the spatial distribution of electronic
density before the collision (3.a), shortly after the colli-
sion (3.b) and for a later time (3.c). As we can see, before
the collision a periodic wake structure exists. Once the
collision takes place, the region of the wakeﬁeld where
the beatwave occurred is strongly distorted. The short
scale (L ∼ λ0/2) ponderomotive force associated with
the beatwave is stronger than the long range (L ∼ λp)
ponderomotive force of the pump laser, and no coherent
movement of the electrons in the scale of λp takes place.
Therefore, the plasma wave is not excited in this region
and no wake is formed. As the pump beam moves away
from the collision region, the wake is reformed and the
bunch of electrons trapped in the bubble becomes clearly
visible (ﬁgure 3.c). We have made simulations in which
the longitudinal and transverse wakeﬁeld were artiﬁcially
frozen shortly before the collision, i.e. the wakeﬁeld is un-
aﬀected by the beatwave. We have found that the charge
injected in the bubble is multiplied by a factor ∼ 10. For
example, for collision at zc = −650 µm, the charge in the
bubble raises from 30 pC to 300 pC.

In the following we compare the numerical predictions
for parallel polarization with experimental results. Fig-
ure 4.a shows the energy of the monoenergetic peak as
a function of the collision position, along with the ex-
perimental results. When the spectrum presents more
than one peak, the highest energy peak is chosen. Ex-
cept for the earliest collision case (zc = −650 µm), the
ﬁnal energy decreases with zc, i.e. a shorter acceleration
distance corresponds to a lower ﬁnal energy. We can see
that there is a good agreement between the simulations
and the experimental data, even though the theoretical

curve is shifted to the left by ∼ 150 − 250 µm.

When the collision between the pump and the injection
beams takes place close to the beginning of the plateau
(zc < −650 µm), no extra energy gain can be obtained.
In this region, the pump pulse amplitude grows quickly
(ﬁgure 1). As the laser ﬁeld becomes stronger, the plasma
wavelength progressively stretches due to the relativistic
redshift of the plasma frequency, i.e. the wakeﬁeld slows
down [15]. Trapped electrons are then able to overcome
the wakeﬁeld, moving farther from the maximum of ac-
celerating ﬁeld.

The experimental charge in the monoenergetic peak
(ﬁgure 4.b) decreases with the peak energy, and it ex-
hibits a drastic drop above 100 MeV. The same trend is

the high energy peak corresponds to the electrons in the
bubble. For low energies (E ≤ 100 MeV), the contribu-
tion from electrons inside and outside the bubble over-
laps, resulting in a single peak . The separation between
the high energy peak and the low energy region is much
clearer in the experimental spectra than in the theoretical
curves.

The simulations we have presented underline the role
played by a number of eﬀects in the determination of the
electron beam properties. The increase of laser intensity
due to self-focusing accounts for the very high accelera-
tion gradients inferred from experimental data.
In ad-
dition to that, self-focusing, along with pulse shortening
due to self-compression, enhances the trapping and there-
fore, the charge of the accelerated bunches. On the other
hand, the wake destruction due to the beatwave reduce
drastically the accelerated charge. According to simula-
tions, the high energy quasi-monochromatic peaks found
experimentally correspond to a single and short electron
bunch accelerated in the bubble. Bunch length predicted
by the simulations ranges between 10 fs FWHM at 60
MeV and 7 fs FWHM at 220 MeV.

The good agreement between simulations and exper-
iments indicates that the assumption of axial symme-
try constitutes a good approximation. Nevertheless, this
approximation can be partly responsible for the overes-
timation of the charge in the simulations, because the
projection of particle density over (r, z) could reduce to
some extent the degree of wake destruction caused by
the beatwave. The second source of asymmetry is the
presence of energetic particles in regions where the laser
ﬁeld is signiﬁcant. Due to the relatively modest charge
of the bunches in the bubble as well as the shortening
of the pump pulse due to self-compression (that reduces
the laser intensity over the bunch), the relevance of this
eﬀect should be small.

found in the simulations, although the charge is overes-
timated by a factor between ∼ 1.3 − 3. Here again, the
theoretical curve is shifted to lower zc. Simulations show
that the number of trapped electrons remains almost un-
changed after the collision. Therefore, the reduction of
the charge with the energy is not due to an extra loss of
trapped electrons along the longer acceleration path.

The injected charge is ﬁrstly determined by the pump
laser amplitude (a0) that grows between z = −1000
and −300 µm due to self-focusing (ﬁgure 1). For zc >
−300 µm, the trapped charge continues to grow even
when the laser amplitude starts to decrease. This is due
to the progressive self-compression of the pump pulse,
that drives the wake more eﬃciently. Besides this, sim-
ulations show that for a given amplitude of the longi-
tudinal ﬁeld, the self-compressed and distorted pulse is
able to trap more electrons. Further study is required to
understand the larger trapping of self-compressed pulses.
A second factor can play a role in the steep drop of
the peak charge above 100 MeV. At high energies (>
100 MeV), the peak corresponding to the electrons in
the bubble is clearly distinct from the contribution of
the other electrons. At low energies, these contributions
partially overlap, originating a larger peak.

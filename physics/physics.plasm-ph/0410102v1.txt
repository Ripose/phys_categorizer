Abstract

It is shown that the anomalous resistivity, thermal conductivity, and magnetic pressure of hot

plasmas can be explained by the assumption that the collisional electron-ion cross-section becomes

constant above some critical temperature. This constant is determined by the size of ion (its elec-

tron envelope). It is shown also that this assumption follows from the consideration of interaction

of a hot plasma with thermal radiation.

It is adopted normally that the only coupling between ions and electrons in hot plasmas

is Coulomb collisions which is rather weak (see, e.g., [1]). The frequency of electron-ion

collisions in this case is given by the formula [2, 3]

νei = nvT eσei ≈ 2πe4nlog (cid:16)nλ3

D(cid:17) / (cid:16)m2

ev3

T e(cid:17) ,

(1)

where n = ne = ni is the electron and ion density, vT e is the thermal velocity of electrons,

σei is the electron-ion collisional cross-section, meand e are the mass and charge of electron

respectively, and λD is the Debye length. It is clear from equation (1) that the Coulomb
collisional cross-section is very small at high temperatures, σei ∝ T −2

, where Te is the

e

electron temperature.

Here we show that this assumption on the electron-ion collisional cross-section is not

correct due to the ﬁnite dimensions of ions in a hot plasma interacting with thermal radiation.

The following eﬀects indicate that the collisional properties of hot plasmas with Te larger

than T0

∼
= 3keV , where T0 is the inversion temperature [8], essentially diﬀer from those of

cold plasmas: 1) anomalous resistivity of a plasma in strong electric ﬁelds [4, 5]; 2) the linear

dependence of magnetic pressure on the magnetic ﬁeld strength inferred from the pressure

and magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles for compact radio sources [6]; 3) radiation-induced solitary waves

in hot accretion disks [7].

Below we consider these eﬀects in more detail.

Consider current instabilities in a plasma in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld. With respect

to the voltage-current characteristics, j = j (E), there are four regimes of electric ﬁelds (see

also [5]):

1) a classical regime (j ∝ E) for very low electric ﬁelds;

2) quasi-linear regime, j

∼
= encs = const, where csis the sound velocity;

3) the heating of a plasma, when the electron temperature, Te, increases, and the voltage-

current characteristics is j ∝ Eα;

4) the regime of the radiative cooling of a plasma, when Te ≈ const, and j ∝ E.

The last regime is normally attributed to the Bunemane instability.

In the region of j = const, the collisional electron-ion cross-section is σei

and the equation Te

∼
= eEl, where l = 1/nσei is the mean free path of electrons, gives
∼
= πne3/E. It means the absence of plasma heating, Te ≈ const. It is the region of the

ion-sound instability.

Due to the turbulent heating of a plasma, the electron-ion collisional cross-section be-

comes a constant, σ0, which is determined by the atomic size (see below). In this case, which

corresponds to a hot plasma in a suﬃciently strong electric ﬁeld, E > Ec

∼
= Tenσ0/e, the

current velocity, ue, is proportional to the electric ﬁeld, E.
∼
= vT e, we have mev2
T e

In the intermediate region of electric ﬁelds, where ue

∼
= eE/ (nσ0),

and therefore vT e ∝ E1/2. Since

j = e2E/ (mevT eσ0)

in this regime j ∝ E1/2. (Compare this result with the relation j ∝ E1/3 given by Galeev

and Sagdeev [5]).

The critical value of the electric ﬁeld, Ec, is determined by equation

which gives

ue = j/en = eE/nmevT eσ0

= Tenσ0/e.

It follows from the above considerations, that in a suﬃciently hot plasmas the electron-

ion collisional cross-section is a constant, σ0, and the frequency of electron-ion collisions is

given by a formula

νei = nvT eσei

∼
= nvT eσ0.

The cross-section σ0 is much larger than the Coulomb collisional cross-section at these

temperatures, and this determines the anomalous resistivity and thermal conductivity [3] of

a plasma.

The origin of the constant cross-section σ0 is as follows. A hot plasma with the temper-

ature Te larger than T0

∼
= 3keV is intensely interacting with the ﬁeld of thermal radiation.

At temperatures T > T0 the stimulated radiation processes dominate this interaction [8].

Thermal radiation induces radiative transitions in the system of electron and ion which

corresponds to the transition of electron from the free to the bounded state.

Thus, in a hot plasma interacting with thermal radiation, the bounded states of electrons

and ions restore, leading to the change of collisional properties of a hot plasma.

In this

case, the electron-ion collisional cross-section has an order of magnitude of the atomic cross-

section, σ0

∼
= 10−15cm2.

Consider now a current tube with the cross-section S = πl2 and the length d placed in a

magnetic ﬁeld B. The current tube is under the action of Ampere’s force:

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

where I = jS is the current, j is the current density, and c is the speed of light.

It is

assumed that the current tube is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld force lines.

Suggesting that the quasilinear regime of the voltage-current characteristics is realized,

we can put

F = BId/c,

j = encs,

where cs is the sound velocity.

The area of the lateral surface of the current tube is A = πld, and now we can calculate

the pressure produced by the magnetic ﬁeld on the current tube:

pB = F/A = eBnlcs/c.

Substituting l by the mean free path of electrons with respect to the scattering on the ions

lei = 1/nσ0, where σ0 is the above high-temperature electron-ion collisional cross-section,

we ﬁnd that

pB = eBcs/σ0c.

The equation (9) gives the linear dependence of the magnetic pressure on the magnetic

ﬁeld strength, contrary to the quadratic dependence given by magneto-hydrodynamics for

cold plasmas (e.g., [4]). For a hot plasma interacting with thermal radiation, we can assume

cs = (T0/mi)

1/2

,

(10)

where T0 is the inversion temperature, and mi is the mass of ions.

In this case the magnetic pressure is simply proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld strength,

the coeﬃcient in this relation being a constant.

Hot plasmas interacting with thermal radiation are characteristic for accretion disks

around compact astrophysical objects such as active galactic nuclei and young pulsars.

In the case of ﬂat-spectrum active galactic nuclei [8, 9, 10, 11] the density, temperature,
and pressure proﬁles have a form n ∝ r−1/2, T ∝ r−1, P = nkT ∝ r−3/2. Since for compact
radio sources B ∝ r−3/2, from equation (9) we obtain P ∝ PB. The latter relationship
conﬁrms equation (9). Here the density, temperature and pressure proﬁles are the same as

those in the convection-dominated accretion ﬂow (CDAF) models [9]. The magnetic ﬁeld

proﬁle is diﬀerent since the expression for the magnetic pressure is changed. The ratio of

magnetic to gas pressure will be ﬁxed similar to the CDAF models.

It is adopted normally (e.g., [1]) that, in a hot plasma of an accretion disk, the only

coupling between ions and electrons is Coulomb collisions which is rather weak, and, since

the radiation of electrons is much stronger than that of ions, the ion temperature, Ti, is

much higher than that of electrons, Te.

It follows from the above consideration that such an assumption is not correct. The

coupling between electrons and ions in a hot plasma interacting with thermal radiation is
strong, and therefore such a hot plasma is roughly the one-temperature plasma, i.e. Te ≈ Ti.

This conclusion is very important for the models of accretion ﬂows in compact astrophysical

objects. In particular, it puts under the question the explanation of the phenomenon of low-

luminosity active galactic nuclei by the models of accretion ﬂows based on the assumption

that Ti is much higher than Te (see, e.g., [1, 9, 10]. It is not surprising that these models

encounter diﬃculties in the explanation of observational properties of low-luminosity active

galactic nuclei.

role.

Another ﬁeld where the strong coupling between electrons and ions in a hot plasma can

essentially change the situation is the theory of envelope (Langmuir) solitary waves [12]. In

the last theory the interaction between Langmuir and ion-sound waves play an important

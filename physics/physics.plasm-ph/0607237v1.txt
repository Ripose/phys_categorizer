Abstract

The equations describing planar magnetoacoustic waves of permanent form in a cold plasma are
rewritten so as to highlight the presence of a naturally small parameter equal to the ratio of the
electron and ion masses. If the magnetic ﬁeld is not nearly perpendicular to the direction of wave
propagation, this allows us to use a multiple-scale expansion to demonstrate the existence and nature
of nonlinear wave solutions. Such solutions are found to have a rapid oscillation of constant amplitude
superimposed on the underlying large-scale variation. The approximate equations for the large-scale
variation are obtained by making an adiabatic approximation and in one limit, new explicit solitary
pulse solutions are found. In the case of a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld, conditions for the existence
of solitary pulses are derived. Our results are consistent with earlier studies which were restricted to
waves having a velocity close to that of long-wavelength linear magnetoacoustic waves.

Introduction

For a plasma composed of cold electrons and a single species of cold ions, both collisions and Lan-
dau damping can be neglected with the result that a two-ﬂuid model provides an accurate description
(Kakutani et al. 1968). Such a model is governed by the continuity and momentum equations for elec-
trons and ions, and Maxwell’s equations. In the study of non-relativistic hydromagnetic waves with a
frequency much less than the plasma frequency, these equations may be simpliﬁed somewhat by neglect-
ing the displacement current and taking the number densities of electrons and ions to be equal, except
in Poisson’s equation (Kakutani et al. 1967). Then taking all quantities to be independent of y and z
one arrives at a set of equations governing planar hydromagnetic waves. Il’ichev (1996) integrates these
to obtain the following equations for a magnetoacoustic wave of permanent form propagating in the
x-direction at a constant speed V :

VA, and the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld strength. In such units the speed of a linear long-wavelength
magnetoacoustic wave is unity. The remaining parameters are deﬁned by Ri = ωcil/VA and Re = ωcel/VA
where ωci and ωce are the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies, respectively. The values of the dependent
variables in the absence of a wave are zero for v, w, ˆBy, and Bz, and unity in the case of n.

The results we present here originate from our observation that equations (1a) may be rewritten so

Ri/Re is simply the ratio of the electron and ion masses. With ε

10−3 or smaller, any
where ε
analytical treatment should make use of the smallness of this parameter and some form of perturbation
theory is obviously called for. Furthermore, even a purely numerical method of solution should attempt
to take advantage of the smallness of ε as otherwise it means integrating over many small-scale variations
before the underlying variation on the large scale takes place.

From (4a) it can be seen that generally v and w change on a much slower scale than ˆBy and Bz. It is
therefore natural to make an adiabatic approximation (see Haken (1983)) which is equivalent to equating
the right-hand sides of (4c) and (4d) to zero. This gives

∼

Bz =

¯V w,

−

ˆBy =

¯V v.

−

These relationships can be used to eliminate ˆBy and Bz and it is shown in Appendix A that all the
dependent variables can be expressed in terms of a single variable which itself satisﬁes a Newtonian type
energy equation with a polynomial Sagdeev potential. This equation is then used to show the existence
of solitary pulses and nonlinear waves on the larger scale. However, it should be stressed that the very
nature of the adiabatic approximation as used in the above is to eliminate any variation on the smaller
scale. Furthermore, the class of solutions to (4a) is restricted, in view of relationships (5), which implies
that at some particular value of s the corresponding values of (Bz, w) and ( ˆBy, v) are not independent.
It is the purpose of this paper to construct a perturbation expansion based on the smallness of ε
which allows one to put the adiabatic approximation in context and to allow for rapid oscillations on
the small scale. These eﬀects have been studied analytically in Il’ichev (1996) and later numerically by
Bakholdin and Il’ichev (1998) and Bakholdin et al. (2002). However, those studies were only carried out
for the case V = 1+µ/2 where µ is small. In the present paper, the analytic theory based on the smallness
of ε, a naturally small parameter, clearly shows the origin of all the basic features of the solutions they
obtain and is not restricted to small µ.

The underlying form of the governing equations suggests that a multiple-scale perturbation expansion
is appropriate and this is carried out in Sec. 2 where explicit equations are obtained which describe the
evolution of v, w, ˆBy, and Bz on both the small and large scale to lowest signiﬁcant order in ε. This
π/2 singularities develop in (4a) and so
analysis is only valid when cos θ is not small. For θ close to
an alternative set of variables and equations derived from (1a) must be employed, as is shown in Sec. 3.
The ﬁnal section summarizes our results and the further applicability of our approach is discussed.

2 Multiple-scale perturbation expansion

The perturbation expansion is based on the implication from equations (4a) that two distinct spatial
scales exist – a large one and a small one. We formally proceed by introducing multiple scales, s, s1 =
εs, s2 = ε2s, . . . and treating them as independent variables so that

+ ε

and allowing all dependent variables f to be functions of s, s1, . . . and expressible in the form

f (s) = f0(s, s1, . . .) + εf1(s, s1, . . .) + . . . ,

although in the following it is not necessary to consider the scaled variables beyond s (the small scale)
and s1 (the large scale). For a more general introduction to this form of perturbation theory see, for
example, Nayfeh and Mook (1979) and Rowlands (1990).

Substituting the above form for the dependent variables into (4a) and (4b) gives to lowest order

∂v0
∂s

= 0,

∂w0
∂s

= 0,

and so v0 and w0 can only be functions of s1, and not s. At lowest order, (4c) and (4d) reduce to

and h(s1) is an as yet to be determined function of s1. Substituting the above results into (2) gives, to
this approximation,

Thus A, D, and E are functions of s1 only and the s variation of n0 is through φ only. Integrating the
reciprocal of (9) after using (10) to express n0 in terms of φ yields

To lowest order, the adiabatic approximation (5) is

Comparison with equations (7) shows that this approximation is equivalent to setting h = 0. Equations
(15) and (18) then form a complete set which can be integrated. The details are given in Appendix A.
In particular, the existence of solitary pulses is proven.

If the adiabatic approximation is not made, it is necessary to obtain an equation for the variation of
h on the s1 scale. This is achieved by considering the equations for ˆBy and Bz to next order in ε. From
(4c) and (4d) we may write, respectively,

Then inserting the above expressions and results (15) and (18) into (22) and simplifying we ﬁnd that
the right-hand side of (22) is zero and hence that h is a constant. This is in agreement with the result
obtained for V close to 1 in Il’ichev (1996).

In summary, we have seen that to lowest order, the ion drift velocity components v and w only show
large-scale variation. Fast periodic variation occurs at the next order of approximation, as given by (16)
and (19), but given the smallness of ε, these oscillations would be barely discernible. On the other hand,
even to lowest order, the magnetic ﬁeld components show rapid oscillations on top of the large-scale
variation:

Bz0 =

equations expressed in terms of ξ rather than s and deﬁne X
we need to use scaled versions of the ion drift velocities, deﬁned by ¯v = v/√ε and ¯w = w/√ε. Then

trivial zeros of the expression for Q given in (32) must lie within the range

The zero which is larger in magnitude never satisﬁes this. The remaining zero at

the condition if β > 1/9. Using (29) we can now write the suﬃcient condition for the existence of a

4 Conclusions

We have studied a set of magnetohydrodynamic equations for planar magnetoacoustic waves of permanent
form propagating in a two-component cold plasma and, by taking advantage of the smallness of the
ratio of the electron to ion masses, have obtained a reduced set of equations which describe the large-
scale variation of the magnetoacoustic wave solution of the full equations. Superimposed on the large-
scale variation, multiple-scale perturbation analysis indicates that there is a rapid oscillation which is of
constant amplitude in the case of the lowest-order magnetic ﬁeld components. These results are consistent
with the study of Il’ichev (1996) which was restricted to a narrow range of velocities. In addition, the
approach expounded in this paper puts the adiabatic approximation into its true context.

In this work we have obtained various conditions for the existence of solitary pulses. Whether these
solutions correspond to phenomena that could occur in nature depends on whether they are stable. Linear
stability analysis of the solutions shown to exist in this paper is a challenging problem. However, the
numerical solution of the full (time-dependent) system of equations obtained by Bakholdin and Il’ichev
(1998), show that for a range of initial conditions the solution relaxes to the type of solution shown to
exist here. This suggests that our solutions are stable, at least to perturbations applied in the direction
of propagation.

Although the equations studied here arise from a magnetohydrodynamics problem, the method is
applicable to a more general set of nonlinear equations where two distinct scales are a basic feature.
An advantage of the present study is that the equations obtained on the large scale can be investigated
analytically and describe real physical processes. Although we have only looked at cold plasmas, an
exactly analogous procedure can be applied to the case of warm plasmas, at the expense of some additional
algebraic complexity. The relevant governing equations are given in Bakholdin et al. (2002).

This is of the form of the energy equation of a particle with position A in a Sagdeev potential which is
minus the right-hand side of (39). In general, nonlinear waves exist and in particular solitary pulses. The

The requirement that (40) gives rise to a solitary pulse is that a + b + c > 0. Using the above renders
this condition as ( ¯V 2

V 2) > 0 which on rearranging yields

As illustrated in Fig. 1, since c < 0, if the above condition is satisﬁed, compressive solitary pulses will
always occur. However, rarefactive pulses are only possible if the smaller root of a + bA + cA2 = 0 is
above zero. This will occur if a < 0 and ¯V 2 < 2. These requirements are equivalent to the condition

cos2 θ < V 2 < 1.

This implies that if the values of V and θ are such that compressive pulses exist, then rarefactive pulses
will also occur if

It is possible to integrate (40) to obtain the spatial variation of the solitary pulses implicitly. An

Using (36) and (38) we can then obtain the corresponding expressions for w0 and v0:

In this adiabatic approximation, the lowest order components of the magnetic ﬁeld are just multiples of
these quantities, as given by (20).

We can now also use (42) and (43) to obtain the solution when ¯V 2 = 1. This corresponds to the limit
2V tan θ. As a check on our calculation, we note that

B Explicit expression for φ(s, s1)

The variation of φ with s is given implicitly by (12). An explicit expression can be obtained by writing

It can be seen that φ has a directed component, S, on which a periodic variation is superimposed. Since
A and hence the period vary on the s1 timescale, to the order in ε to which (45) applies, it is more
appropriate to re-deﬁne S by

Such a deﬁnition avoids secular terms at higher order in the ε expansion.

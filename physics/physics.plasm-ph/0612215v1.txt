Fluctuations and control in the Vlasov-Poisson
equation

Ricardo Lima∗and R. Vilela Mendes†‡§

Abstract

In this paper we study the ﬂuctuation spectrum of a linearized
Vlasov-Poisson equation in the presence of a small external electric
ﬁeld. Conditions for the control of the linear ﬂuctuations by an exter-
nal electric ﬁeld are established.

1 Introduction

In the past, the ﬂuctuation spectrum of charged ﬂuids was studied either by
the BBGKY hierarchy derived from the Liouville or Klimontovich equations,
with some sort of closure approximation, or by direct approximations to the
N-body partition function or by models of dressed test particles, etc. (see
reviews in [1] [2]).

Alternatively, by linearizing the Vlasov equation about a stable solution
and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, a method has been developed [3] that
uses the eigenvalues associated to the continuous spectrum and a canonical
partition function to compute correlation functions. Here this approach will
also be followed to study the control of the ﬂuctuations. For simplicity we
will consider the one-space dimensional case.

A Vlasov-Poisson equation with an external electrical ﬁeld control term
is considered. Following the method developed by Morrison [4] we use an
integral transform to solve the linearized equation. With a view to applica-
tions to more general kinetic equations (gyrokinetic, etc.) we also discuss in
the appendix a generalization of Morrison’s integral transform.

Control of the Vlasov-Poisson equation

∂tf + v · ▽xf + ▽xφ · ▽vf = C (t, x, v)

in a periodic domain

(t, x, v) ∈ [0, T ] × T n × Rn

by means of an interior control located in a spatial subdomain has been
discussed by Glass [5]. Conditions for controllability between two small dis-
tribution distributions f0 and f1 were established. However, to steer f0 to f1
a control C (t, x, v) that depends on the velocities is required and it is not
clear how such a control could be implemented in practice. Therefore, we
have restricted ourselves to the more realistic situation of a (small) control-
ling external electric ﬁeld. In addition we concentrate on the problem of the
damping of the small oscillations around an equilibrium distribution.

In Sect.2 the linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with control is solved
by an integral transform and in Sect.3 two controlling problems are studied,
namely the control of the total energy of the ﬂuctuations by a constant
electric ﬁeld and the dynamical damping of the ﬂuctuating modes by a time-
dependent electric ﬁeld.

Nonlinear stability of the steady states of the Vlasov-Poisson equation when
the phase-space density is a decreasing function of the particle energy or
depend on other invariants has been studied[6] [7] by the energy-Casimir
method[8]. This means that deviations from the steady-state will remain
bounded in time.

However, as expected from the non-dissipative nature of the Vlasov equa-
tion, the linear ﬂuctuation modes of the uncontrolled equation are oscillatory
and, once excited by a perturbation, they will not decay. As shown by Morri-
son [4] they may be used to obtain a statistical description of the ﬂuctuations
by the construction of a partition function. Here, one focus on the control
of the ﬂuctuations by the external electric ﬁeld. Two situations will be con-
sidered. The ﬁrst considers a constant in time electric ﬁeld and tries to
minimize the total energy associated to the ﬂuctuations. The functional to
be minimized is

F1 (Ek) = lim

In the second situation we allow the electric ﬁeld to be time-dependent and
chosen in a such a way as to introduce a damping eﬀect in the solution (15).
For the ﬁrst case (Ek independent of time), with the solution (15) one

obtains a minimum for the functional F1 at

3 Appendix. An integral transform for lin-

earized kinetic equations

Morrison [4] solves the linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation by a Hilbert trans-
form. However, for some practical applications, the linearized kinetic equa-
tions are more complex. For example the gyrokinetic Vlasov equation written
in gyrocenter phase-space coordinates is [9]

•

•

(23)

where

•
X6= U

This is the motivation to study an equation more general than the lin-
earized Vlasov-Poisson (9). Linearized Fourier kinetic equations are of the
type

∂f (v)
∂t

+ g1 (v) f (v) + g2 (v)

g3 (µ) f (µ) dµ + C (v, t) = 0

(24)

with g1 a monotone function of v. Let T be a transform such that

(T g1f ) (u) =

g3 (µ) f (µ) dµ + g1 (µ) (T f ) (u)

(25)

namely

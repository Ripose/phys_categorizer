It is found that in magnetized electrostatic plasma ﬂows the
velocity shear couples ion-acoustic waves with ion-cyclotron
waves and leads, under favorable conditions, to their eﬃ-
cient reciprocal transformations. It is shown that in a two-
dimensional setup this coupling has a remarkable feature: it is
governed by equations that are exactly similar to the ones de-
scribing coupling of sound waves with internal gravity waves
[Rogava & Mahajan: Phys. Rev. E 55, 1185 (1997)] in neu-
tral ﬂuid ﬂows. Using another noteworthy quantum mechan-
ical analogy we calculate transformation coeﬃcients and give
fully analytic, quantitative description of the coupling eﬃ-
ciency for ﬂows with low shearing rates.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well-known that in ﬂows with spatially inhomo-
geneous velocities, due to the non-self-adjointness (“non-
normality” [1]) of their linear dynamics, collective phe-
nomena are strongly inﬂuenced by the presence of the
velocity shear [2].
In non-uniformly ﬂowing plasmas,
for example, characteristic nonperiodic modes — “Lang-
muir vortices” [3], “ion-acoustic vortices” [4] and “dust-
acoustic vortices” [5] — are arising due to the presence
of the inhomogeneous velocity ﬁeld. They are analogous
to so called “Kelvin modes” [6] (originally disclosed by
Lord Kelvin [7]) in plane Couette ﬂows. Moreover, “tra-
ditional” modes, present in plasmas also in the absence
of the ﬂow, are also interacting with “ambient” ﬂows and
strongly modiﬁed by the velocity shear. The modes may
undergo transient (algebraic) growth [6], and/or linear
(adiabatic) ampliﬁcation [8] of their energy, asymptoti-
cally persistent shear instabilities may also arise [9] due
to the kinematic complexity of “parent” ﬂows.

Another important and interesting issue, related with
the propagation of waves in ﬂows, is related with the
ability of the velocity shear to couple waves [10] and
to ensure their mutual transformations. Shear-induced
wave couplings exist in hydrodynamic systems (coupling
of sound waves and internal gravity waves [11]), in MHD
(both electron-proton and electron-positron plasmas),
where velocity shear couples all three MHD wave modes

(Alfv´en waves, slow magnetosonic waves and fast magne-
tosonic waves) [12], and in dusty plasmas [5]. This phe-
nomenon is important in a wide variety of astrophysical
applications, including solar atmosphere and solar wind
[13], pulsar magnetosphere [14], galactic gaseous disks
[15], self-gravitating, diﬀerentially rotating dusty plasma
clouds [16] and astrophysical jets [17].

The mission of this paper is threefold. First, it demon-
strates that the shear-induced transformations in plas-
mas are not characteristic only to MHD systems but they
exist and are eﬃcient also for low-frequency electrostatic
waves: the ion-sound waves (ISW) and the ion-cyclotron
waves (ICW). Second, using recently developed method
of the evaluation of the transformation coeﬃcients [18],
we give full quantitative and analytic description of the
coupling eﬃciency for the case of low shearing rate ﬂows.
Third, we point out that the mathematical description of
this particular sort of wave coupling is exactly analogous
to the one in neutral ﬂuid ﬂows: coupling of sound waves
with internal gravity waves [11]! This remarkable cir-
cumstance once more highlights the universality of shear-
induced phenomena in the physics of continuous media.

II. MAIN CONSIDERATION

Let us consider the simplest possible setup: the equi-
librium magnetic ﬁeld
B0 is homogeneous and directed
along the X axis ~
B0, 0, 0); the mean velocity
(
~
(Ay, 0, 0) is also directed along the X axis and has
U0 ≡
a linear shear along the Y axis. The equilibrium densi-
ties of both electrons
Ni are homogeneous.
Ne and ions
The temperature of electrons Te is constant, while ions
are supposed to be cold Ti = 0.

B0 ≡

It is well known that ISW and ICW with phase ve-
locities considerably less than Alfv´en speed ω/kx≪VA ≡
B0/√4πM
Ni (M is the ion mass) do not perturb the
background magnetic ﬁeld, and a good approximation
for the electric ﬁeld [19] is: E =

ϕ.

Another common assumption for low-frequency elec-
trostatic waves is that the electrons “thermalize along
the ﬁeld lines” and the electron number density can be
described by the Boltzmann distribution [19]:

the existence of the non-uniform motion, β2(τ ) sooner

A. Transformation coeﬃcient

The coupled oscillator systems similar to (10) with
slowly varying coeﬃcients are well known in diﬀerent
branches of physics. Mathematical methods for their
analysis were ﬁrst developed for quantum mechanical
problems: non-elastic atomic collisions [20] and non-
adiabatic transitions in two level quantum systems [21].
Later, similar asymptotic methods were successfully ap-
plied to various other problems [22].

In [18] these eﬃcient mathematical tools were used,
for the ﬁrst time, for the study of the velocity shear in-
duced coupling and transformation of MHD waves. The
problem which we are studying now, also allows thor-
ough probing by means of this asymptotic method. We
consider (most interesting for practical applications) case
R
1, when coeﬃcient in (10) are slowly varying func-
tions of τ and, therefore, WKB approximation is valid
everywhere except nearby the turning points (Ωi(τt) = 0)
and resonant points
(Ω1(τr) = Ω2(τr)). Using (11) one
can check that the condition

≪

Ω(1)

Ω2
i .

(13)

i ≪
is satisﬁed for both wave modes at any moment of time,
or equivalently, none of the turning points are located
near the real τ -axis. From physical point of view this
means, that there are no (over)reﬂection phenomena [18]
and only the resonant coupling between diﬀerent waves
modes with the same sign of
phase velocity can occur.
From (11) we also learn that there are two pairs of

complex conjugated resonant points of the ﬁrst order1:

β(τ ±

1 ) =

i(ωc −

±

1), β(τ ±

2 ) =

±

i(ωc + 1).

(14)

Therefore all the resonant points are located on the axis
Re[β(τ )] = 0 in the complex τ -plane and consequently,
the resonant coupling can take place only in a vicinity of
the point τ∗ where β(τ∗) = 0. Generally, the time scale
R−1/2
of resonant coupling ∆τ is of the order of ∆τ
[18] and the evolution of the waves is adiabatic when

If this condition is met the temporal evolution of the

Let us assume that initially β(0)

to the linear drift in the k-space, β(τ ) decreases and
when the condition (15) fails to work, the mode dynam-

None of the turning points are located near the real τ -
axis and, therefore, only wave modes with the same sign
of the phase velocity along the x-axis can eﬀectively in-
teract. It is well known [24] that in this case components
of T± and T∓ are exponentially small with respect to
the large parameter 1/R and can be neglected. Conse-
quently, (18) decomposes and reduces to:

Generally, this equation represents conservation of the
wave action. When R
1 it transcribes into the en-
ergy conservation throughout the resonant coupling of
wave modes [18]. The components of the transition ma-
trix in (18) are complex, i.e., the coupling of diﬀerent
wave modes changes not only the absolute values of D±
i ,
2
but also their phases. The value of the quantity
T12|

represents a part of the energy transformed during the
resonant coupling of the modes. The absolute values
of the transition matrix components
are
called the transformation coeﬃcients of corresponding

symmetry property of the transition matrix:

i.e., transformation coeﬃcients are reciprocally equal to

It is well known, that if in the neighborhood of the
real τ -axis only a pair of complex conjugated ﬁrst or-
der resonant points τr and τ ∗
r exists, the transformation
coeﬃcient is [18]:

As it was mentioned earlier, coupling between ICW

and ISW can be eﬀective if
transformation coeﬃcient is exponentially small with re-
spect to the large parameter R−1 [24,25]. If this condition
is satisﬁed the resonant points τ ±
1 [see (14)] tend to the
real τ -axis and, hence, the eﬀective coupling is possible.

In the case of moderate or high shearing rates, similarly
1, one can show that the WKB approx-
to the case R
≪
imation is valid only when β(τ )
1, R. It means that
the asymptotic problem can still be formulated. How-
ever, when the shearing rate is not small, non-adiabatic
evolution of the modes consists of both transformation
and reﬂection phenomena. From mathematical point of
view it means that, in general, all the components of
the transition matrix signiﬁcantly diﬀer from zero. Con-
servation of the wave action remains valid and provides
following important relation [18]:

However, it should be also stressed that for high shear-
ing rates no analytical expressions for the components of
the transition matrix can be written explicitly.

B. Hydrodynamical analogy

The remarkable feature of our governing equations (10)
is that they are almost identical with the pair of equations
from [11] (numbered there as equations (16) and (17)):

ψ(2) + ψ + β(τ )e = 0,

(26a)

≃

(cid:2)

(26b)

e(2) +

e + β(τ )ψ = 0.

W 2 + β2(τ )
(cid:3)
These equations also describe coupling of two wave
modes. But this is totally diﬀerent physical system:
shear ﬂow of a gravitationally stratiﬁed neutral ﬂuid,
which sustains sound waves and internal gravity waves.
In [11] it was shown that these modes are coupled through
the agency of the shear and may eﬀectively transform into
each other, providing the condition W

1 is met.

The presence of this analogy implies that all the de-
tails of the transformation coeﬃcient asymptotic analy-
sis, which were given above, can also be applied to the
named hydrodynamic example of the shear induced wave
couplings. The only factual diﬀerence is that we have to
replace the dimensionless frequency of electrostatic ion-
cyclotron waves ωc by the characteristic dimensionless
frequency W of the internal gravity waves.

This analogy allows also to predict that within the elec-
trostatic problem we should have a new kind of electro-
static beat waves just as they exist in the hydrodynamical
problem! Beat waves are excited when an initial pertur-
bation propagates almost along the ﬂow axis (β0≪
1 and
when, additionally, τ∗ is suﬃciently large in comparison
with the beat period Ωb≡
Ω1 −

Ω2.

III. CONCLUSION

≪

Summarizing main properties of the resonant coupling
of ICW and ISW for small shearing rates (R
1) we can
state that: (a) Only the wave modes with the same sign
of the phase velocity can eﬀectively interact - there are
no reﬂection phenomena; (b)The duration of the eﬀective
R−1/2, i.e.,
coupling of the modes is of the order of ∆τ
resonant coupling is slow compared to the wave period
1 but fast enough compared to the adiabatic change
τΩ ∼
R−1; (c) The total energy
of the system parameters τa ∼
of the modes is conserved during the resonant coupling -
the transformed wave is generated at the expense of the
energy of the initial wave mode; (d) The mode coupling
process is symmetric - transformation coeﬃcient of one
mode into another one equals the coeﬃcient of the inverse
process. (e) The transformation coeﬃcients are given by
(22) and (24).

∼

None of these features remain valid for moderate and
high shearing rates. If R
1 is not satisﬁed, there are
≪
no ’long’ and ’shirt’ timescales in the problem and all
the processes have approximately the same characteristic
timescale. Hence, the coupling of the modes represents
some mixture of transformation and reﬂection precesses,
that are accompanied by the energy exchange between
the waves and the background ﬂow.

The discovered ICW–ISW transformations are likely
to be important in a number of applications. One possi-
ble example is the problem of the ICW observed by low
altitude satellites and ground based magnetometers [26].
Observational surveys indicate that these waves are cor-
related with the ICW observed in the equatorial magne-

4

tosphere. However, theoretical studies of the ICW prop-
agation from the magnetosphere to the ground suggest
that these waves can not penetrate through the Buchs-
baum resonance and can not reach ionospheric layers of
the atmosphere. Thus, one could expect that the mag-
netospheric ICW shouldn’t be correlated with the iono-
spheric ICW, while observational evidence shows the cor-
relation. Recently Johnson and Cheng [26] reconsidered
this problem and found that strong mode coupling oc-
curs near the He+ and O+ resonance locations. They
argued that this coupling may help the equatorial ICW
to penetrate to ionospheric altitudes.

It seems reasonable to admit that the velocity-shear-
induced ICW-ISW coupling may provide yet another
mode transformation mechanism, which in conjunction
with the one, found by Johnson and Cheng, may account
for the penetration of the ICW through the Buchsbaum
resonance. This may work in a quite similar way to the
scenario given in the [27] for the penetration of the fast
magnetosonic waves (FMW) from the chromosphere to
the corona through the solar transition region. The idea
is that a fraction of the FMW transforms into the Alfv´en
waves (AW). The latter go through the transition region
up to the solar corona, where they again become trans-
formed into the FMW. In this way ‘shear-induced oscilla-
tions of solar MHD waves’ [27], ensures substantial trans-
port of the FMW through the transition region. It seems
plausible to admit that the similar reciprocal ‘swinging’
of ICW and ISW may allow some fraction of the ICW
to penetrate through the Buchsbaum resonance and to
reach the low ionospheric altitudes.

Finally, the remarkable exact analogy of the ICW-ISW
coupling with the coupling of internal gravity waves and
sound waves in hydrodynamic ﬂows [11] points out, once
again, at the universal character of the velocity shear
induced phenomena in the physics of ﬂuids and plasmas.

Criticality in a Vlasov–Poisson system – a fermionic universality class

School of Physics, The University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Sydney, Australia

A model Vlasov–Poisson system is simulated close the point of marginal stability, thus assuming
only the wave-particle resonant interactions are responsible for saturation, and shown to obey the
power–law scaling of a second-order phase transition. The set of critical exponents analogous to
those of the Ising universality class is calculated and shown to obey the Widom and Rushbrooke
scaling and Josephson’s hyperscaling relations at the formal dimensionality d = 5 below the critical
point at nonzero order parameter. However, the two-point correlation function does not correspond
to the propagator of Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory, which is the Gaussian model for the Ising
Instead it corresponds to the propagator for the fermionic vector ﬁeld and to

the upper critical dimensionality dc = 2. This suggests criticality of collisionless Vlasov-Poisson
systems as representative of the universality class of critical phenomena of a fermionic quantum
ﬁeld description.

INTRODUCTION

The remarkable property of critical phenomena is the
universal scaling appearing in vast variety of systems;
e.g., magnets and gases follow simple power laws for
the order parameter, speciﬁc heat capacity, susceptibil-
ity, compressibility, etc. [1]. In thermodynamic systems,
phase transitions take place at a critical temperature Tcr
when the coeﬃcients that characterize the linear response
of the system to external perturbations diverge. Then
long–range order appears, causing a transition to a new
phase due to collective behavior of the entire system [2].
The condition for nonlinear saturation in the test case

of the bump–on–tail instability in plasmas [3] is

ωb ≈

3.2γL

(1)

γβ
L.

∼

[4, 5], where γL is the linear growth rate of a weakly
unstable Langmuir wave according to the Landau the-
ory [6], ωb = (eEk/m)1/2 is the frequency of oscillations
for particles trapped by the wave. These trapped par-
ticles generate a long–range order of the wavelength k,
the saturated amplitude E can be considered as the or-
der parameter, and the condition of saturation can be
rewritten as a power law, typical for the second-order
phase transitions, E

However, unlike thermodynamics this scaling contains
the nonthermal control parameter γL, which is deter-
mined by the slope of the distribution function ∂f0/∂v
at the phase speed vr = ωpe/k of the perturbation near
the electron plasma frequency ωpe. [For thermodynamic
systems like magnets for which the magnetization M be-
low the Curie point Tcr is the order parameter, the scal-
ing is M
Tcr)/Tcr at T < Tcr.]
Another diﬀerence is the critical exponent itself – rela-
tion (1) predicts the very unusual exponent β = 2; in
contrast, the hydrodynamic Hopf bifurcation [7], also de-
scribed by the same scaling between the saturated am-
plitude and the growth rate, has the mean–ﬁeld critical
exponent β = 1/2.

An analysis [8] assuming thermalization in a Vlasov–
Poisson plasma or gravitating system leads to a critical
exponent β < 1, and the exponent β = 1/2 has also been
hypothesized for the bump-on-tail instability in [9]. How-
ever, detailed center-manifold analysis, which establishes
the normal form for a weakly unstable perturbation in
one-component collisionless Vlasov-Poisson system, con-
ﬁrms β = 2 [10]. The exponent β = 2 is also conﬁrmed
numerically [11, 12].

The striking discrepancy between these exponents can
be better understood if we consider the structure of the
phase space corresponding to these cases. The exponents
β = 1/2 [7] and β < 1 [8] correspond either to saturation
of a strongly dissipative instability or to a thermalized
system. In both these cases the distribution function can
be factorized as f (q, p) = y(q)g(p), where g(p) can be as-
sumed to be Gaussian, and the system is described by its
momenta. The exponent β = 2 corresponds to saturation
due to nonlinear wave-particle interactions in a weakly
unstable collisionless system, where correlations between
coordinates and impulses are not destroyed by dissipa-
tive processes, so the description cannot be reduced to
moments of the distribution.

{

ρ, ¯v, T

More formally, a dissipative and/or thermalized sys-
tem is represented by a discrete set of momenta of the
distribution function f (x, v, t), which depend only on the
coordinate x, but not on the velocity v, M =
,
}
where ρ, ¯v, and T are the local density, the velocity, and
the temperature, respectively. The evolution is a ﬂow
gt which maps M onto itself, gt : M
M . In fact, in
a neighborhood of the threshold γL = 0 the evolution
M can be reduced to a normal form, which
gt : M
maps only the order parameter, g′
n, where n = R0
t: n
(or C0, where C is the set of complex numbers), and
therefore the evolution is a trajectory n = n(t) or in
other words the set Y = R+
R0. The phase space
of a one-dimensional collisionless system is a continuous
R and evolution can be represented as the
set H = R
H. (For periodic boundary conditions the
ﬂow wt: H

T is isomorphic to a circle.) The sets n and H (or C) have
diﬀerent dimensionality, and therefore renormalization of
collisionless system in a vicinity of threshold – i.e., trans-
formation of the set H and the mapping wt – involves one
or more additional dimension. Further it is shown below,
that scaling transformations close to the threshold are in-
terrelated with the additional velocity coordinate, which
disappears in hydrodynamic description because of inte-
gration of the distribution function f (x, v, t) over v.

From the theory of critical phenomena it is known that
dimensionality d is inseparable part of the threshold de-
scription – along with the critical exponents (e.g., [13]).
Besides β, other critical exponents: α, γ, δ, ν, and η,
describe the following scalings of the Ising universality
class: (i) the speciﬁc heat capacity scales as

C =

dT ∝ |

(ii) the susceptibility as

(iii) the response M at ǫ = 0 as

(iv) the correlation length as

and (v) the two-point correlation function as

These exponents are not independent, but are interre-

lated via scaling laws, e.g., the Widom equality

[14]. These scaling laws also include hyperscaling laws
such as Josephson’s law,

[15] which involves the dimensionality d along with the
exponents.

For thermodynamics the mean–ﬁeld exponents are of
the Landau-Weiss set, α = 0, β = 1/2, γ = 1, δ = 3,
ν = 1/2, and η = 0, and the scaling laws hold at the for-
mal dimensionality d = 4. However, the possibilities of
critical phenomena are not exhausted by the Ising uni-
versality class – the percolation critical exponents [16],
which describe another vast class of critical phenomena,
are diﬀerent from those in thermodynamics and scaling
laws hold at a diﬀerent dimensionality. In particular, for
the Bethe lattice (or Cayley tree) [17] Josephson’s law
holds at dimensionality d = 6. Despite the description
being the same, this diﬀerence separates the cases into

For a collisionless gravitating system, where the sat-
uration mechanism is the same as for the bump-on-

1.907
δ = 1.544
0.002 can be determined analogously to ther-
modynamics and calculated from the response to an ex-
ternal pump [19]. These exponents are very diﬀerent
from the thermodynamic set, but nevertheless satisfy the
Widom equality, thus suggesting the validity of scaling
laws. Josephson’s law also holds, but at a rather sur-
4.68
prising dimensionality which is the fractal one d
[19]. At the same time, the processes resulting in β
1.9
diﬀer qualitatively from those resulting in β = 2, similar
to thermodynamics where spatial ﬂuctuations of the or-
der parameter, neglected in mean ﬁeld theories, result in
β
0.33, therefore suggesting other universality classes
were not completely ruled out. These could be the wave-
wave interactions, responsible for the strong turbulence
in plasma [20]), which are next in dynamical importance
and have fewer degrees of freedom [21].

In this paper, we use numerical simulations to study
the threshold scalings in a weakly unstable collisionless
Vlasov-Poisson system. Depending on the sign of the
Poisson equation this set of equations describes either
a plasma system or a gravitating system. The satura-
tion mechanism in a collisionless gravitating system is
the same as for the bump-on-tail instability in plasmas
and threshold corresponds to the condition γL = 0 in
both cases. We show in Section II that the eigenfre-
quency contains only an imaginary part, and therefore
is the simplest model to study the threshold. Section III
describes the results of computations of the critical expo-
nents and demonstrates that the scaling laws describing
saturation are the same for plasma and gravitation. Sec-
tion IV addresses the scaling transformations of the phase
space and the scaling law, which appears as a result of
this symmetry. The exponent which describes correla-
tions are obtained in Section V, where Fisher’s equality
η) is also proved. In Section VI we show that
γ = ν(2
the criticality in the system is described by the Dirac
propagator for a fermionic ﬁeld. We obtain hyperscal-
ing laws and calculate upper critical dimensionalities in
Section VII.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

The eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors of oscillations in
a Vlasov-Poisson system are given by dispersion relation
ε[ω(k), k] = 0 ,

(9)

where ε is the permittivity (dielectric permittivity in the
plasma case). The boundary between stable and unstable
cases is determined by the condition
Im[ε(ω, k)] = 0 ,

(10)

[22]. For the bump-on-tail instability condition (10) sim-
Im(ω) = 0, and criticality is related
pliﬁes to, γL ≡
to the zero of the imaginary part of the eigenfrequency.
Therefore we can employ a model which does not contain
the real part; i.e., Re(ω) = 0. The simplest is the one-
dimensional self-gravitating Vlasov-Poisson model which
is described by the equations

therefore the system remains invariant with respect to

method [24]. The amplitudes Am(t) =
for m =
1, 2, 3, 4 are shown in Figure 1. The perturbation m = 1
grows exponentially with the growth rate predicted by
dispersion relation (25). Then, the growth saturates at
some moment t = tsat at the amplitude Asat = A1(tsat).
Figure 1 also shows the (exponential) growth of per-
turbations with m > 1 while (25) predicts exponential
damping for these modes. This growth occurs because
of nonlinear coupling between modes since the term ρ1f1
dominates over the term ρ2f0 in equation (19) initially,
f1 and therefore one has γ2 = 2ω1 for the
when f2 ≪
growth rate γ2.

Figure 2 shows that Asat is independent on A0 for
small A0, but there exists some threshold value of the
initial perturbation A0, when becomes dependent on A0.
This threshold amplitude Athr corresponds to the trap-

IV. SCALING LAWS AND SYMMETRIES OF
THE MODEL

The remarkable property of the critical exponents γ, β,
and δ is that they satisfy the Widom equality (7) [14] with
high accuracy. In thermodynamics the Widom equality
is a consequence of the scaling of the Gibbs free energy
under the transformation

G(λaǫ ǫ, λaB B) = λG(ǫ, B) ,

from which the scaling exponent is aθ = 1 for β = 2
(aθ = 4 for β = 1/2). Remarkably, the two diﬀerent pro-
cesses – the linear growth of an unstable perturbation due
to the resonant wave-particle interaction and the subse-
quent nonlinear saturation of this process due to particle
trapping are interrelated.

(48)

While there is no thermodynamic equilibrium in the
collisionless system considered here, one can deﬁne the
quantity which describes the response of the system to
external thermal perturbation, just as the speciﬁc heat
capacity describes the response of a thermodynamic sys-
tem to heat transfer, C = δQ/dT . For the case, consid-
ered here

The scaling law (51) can be proven using the homogene-
ity condition (46) (Appendix A). Remarkably, the criti-
cal exponent α does not depend on the sign of Poisson’s
equation, and result is the same for the plasma case.

Unlike thermodynamics where the relation between ex-
ponents β, γ, and α is given by Rushbrooke’s equality,
α + 2β + γ = 2, the scaling law (51) does not contain
the critical exponent γ. Nevertheless, the set of critical

from which it can be derived straightforwardly [1]. The
functions which comply the condition (42) are called gen-
eralized homogeneous functions, and the condition itself
is termed a homogeneity condition.

The nature of this scaling for the marginally-stable
Vlasov-Poisson system is clear from Figure 4, where the
distribution function f (x, v, t) is plotted at the moment
t = tsat. The remarkable property of the critical dynam-
ics is the topological equivalence of the phase portraits
for diﬀerent θ: at the moments of saturation t1 and t2
corresponding to θ1 and θ2 we can write

f (x, λav v, θ1, t1) = λf (x, v, θ2, t2) ,

(43)

or

fm(λav v, θ1, t1) = λfm(v, θ2, t2) ,

(44)

for the Fourier component. Transformation between t1,
θ1 and t2, θ2 can be written as t′
λaθ θ, so

λat t, θ′

→
fm(λat t, λav v, λaθ θ) = λfm(t, v, θ).

→

(45)

A weak external pump in the form F (x) = F1 cos(k1x+
ϕ) creates a similar topology in the phase space because
of the same mechanism of the saturation and adds an ad-
ditional variable to the distribution function. The trans-
formation can be written as F ′
1 F1. Finally for
fm = fm(t, v, θ, F1) we can write the homogeneity condi-
tion as

1 →

λaF

fm(λat t, λav v, λaθ θ, λaF

1 F1) = λfm(t, v, θ, F1).

(46)

The critical exponents β, γ, and δ can be expressed
via the scaling exponents av, aθ, and aF1 from which the
Widom equality for the Vlasov-Poisson system can be
proved directly (Appendix A). They also provide a deep
insight into symmetry properties of the system. Accord-
ing to expression (A4)

this unusual situation has an analog – for particle-particle

that the criticality due to these annihilation processes
belongs to a certain universality class which is diﬀerent
from the Ising universality class [30, 31] and therefore is
not described by the Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian (36).
Another unusual quantity is the correlation length ξ
and the wavevector kξ = ξ−1, whose use allows us to
establish the validity of Fisher’s equality for the colli-
sionless system, studied here. It is not related to the size
of the system L but to the ﬂuctuations in the system
which determine an average path of correlated motion of
particle in presence of these ﬂuctuations. As the system
approaches the threshold, ﬂuctuations become correlated

since the characteristic time of correlations ω−1
diverges as θ

modynamic systems where the correlation length is the
only relevant scale near the critical point as ǫ

∼

To demonstrate that the criticality in the Vlasov-
Poisson system belongs to a diﬀerent class, let us compare
the critical exponents corresponding to the Jeans insta-
bility in a self–gravitating hydrodynamical system [27],
using the same approach. The dispersion relation for
this system is

For collisionless systems the propagator thus corresponds

VII. HYPERSCALING LAWS

The approach assumed in the previous section allows
us to establish the hyperscaling law for the Vlasov-
Poisson system which involves the dimensionality d along
with critical exponents like Josephson’s law (8). Using
propagator (68) which is the potential energy, the speciﬁc
heat capacity C in d-dimensional space at θ
0 can be
obtained as

→

With relation (59), (71) becomes

(72)

Taking into account the scaling law (50) for the speciﬁc
heat capacity C one can obtain the hyperscaling relation
which interrelates the exponents α, ν, and the dimen-
sionality d

α = ν(2

d) .

(73)

−
The last equality reveals d = 2 as the upper critical
dimensionality for the Vlasov-Poisson system since the
heat capacity becomes divergent if d < 2, thus indicating
the importance of ﬂuctuations in the critical area. It also
shows that the dimensionality corresponding to the crit-
3 and ν = 1 is d = 5, ﬂuctuations
ical exponents α =

0 are insigniﬁcant, and therefore α =

γ = 1, ν = 1, and η = 1 are the mean-ﬁeld exponents.

≈

The use of the scalar ﬁeld propagator (67) instead of

(68) gives

α = ν(4

d) ,

−

(74)

and at α = 0 the upper critical dimensionality is dc = 4
which is the Landau mean-ﬁeld theory case for the Ising

8

universality class. However, relation (74) is not valid for
the Vlasov-Poisson system because of its diﬀerent prop-
agator. On the contrary to relations (73) and (74) which
are valid for speciﬁc propagators (67) and (68), Joseph-
son’s law (8) is universal for all cases considered. With
exponents ν = 1 and νf = 1/2 it gives dc = 2 and dc = 4
as the upper critical dimensionalities for the collisionless
and hydrodynamic cases, respectively, and d = 5 for the
exponents of the Vlasov-Poisson system calculated here.
Without going into details here, we note that this uni-
versality appears because the fundamental description is
given by the same functional integrals in both cases. In
particular for the free scalar bosonic ﬁeld (no interac-
tions) the partition function is

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied numerically and analytically a model
Vlasov–Poisson system near the point of a marginal sta-
bility. The most important ﬁnding is that the critical-
ity of the Vlasov–Poisson model studied here belongs to
a universality class described by the propagator corre-
sponding to a fermionic vector ﬁeld. This ﬁnding is in
striking contrast with the previous critical phenomena
studies concerning systems whose criticality belongs to
universality classes corresponding to the scalar bosonic
ﬁelds, like the Ising universality class.

This

from the
fundamental discrepancy emerges
qualitative diﬀerence between objects considered:
the
Landau–Ginzburg Hamiltonian (36) takes into account
spatial variations of the order parameter via the local
diﬀerential operator
, whereas the integro–diﬀerential
operator for the Vlasov–Poisson model acts on the dis-
tribution function containing the additional dimension of
velocity.

∇

We have calculated numerically the critical exponents
which describe the critical state of the model and estab-
lished analytically that these exponents and the dimen-
sionality are interrelated by the scaling and hyperscaling
laws like the Widom, Rushbrooke, and Josephson laws
at the formal dimensionality d = 5. The upper critical
dimensionality is dc = 2 and since d > dc the calculated
exponents are the mean-ﬁeld exponents, diﬀerent from
those which one might expect the Landau–Weiss set of
critical exponents corresponding to the Ising mean–ﬁeld
model where dc = 4. This is related to the higher di-
mensionality of the Vlasov–Poisson kinetic problem as-
sociated with the velocity space and to the type of the
criticality of the Vlasov-Poisson systems, which belongs
to a universality class diﬀerent from the Ising universality
class.

later exponents satisfy scaling laws at fractal dimension

Abstract:

The possibility of formation of quasibound states and ordered structures in dense

plasma is investigated. The eﬀective potentials of dense plasma are used. On the basis of

these models the condition of the ordered structures formation in the system is obtained.

It is shown that in the dense classical plasma the quasibound states form whereas the

ordered structures form in the dense semiclassical plasma.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well known1
−

4 that a classical Coulomb system form several ordered structures. As

shown in Refs. 1 and 2, the strongly coupled one-component plasma will crystallize into a

centered cubic form at the values of the coupling parameter Γ ≫ 1. Here, Γ = e2/(akBT );

e is the electrical charge; a = (3/4πn)1/3 is the average distance between particles (Wigner

- Seitz radius); n is the number density of particles; kB and T are the Boltzmann constant

and the temperature of plasma, respectively.

In previous papers3,4, we studied the structural and thermodynamic properties of the

two-component model plasma. The formation of the “near ordering” and anomalous

increasing of the particle correlation radius as a consequence of microstructure changes

in plasma have been demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulation method. The “hexatic”-

like structures which characterized of liquid crystals were found in Refs. 5,6. In Refs.

7,8 the properties of the shell structures of ﬁnite one-component plasma clouds have been

investigated. The study of ordered structures is especially important in connection with

the rapid development of dusty plasma. The ordered structures that form in a strongly

coupled plasma have been ﬁrst analyzed theoretically in Ref. 9 and have come to be

known as plasma crystals. The plasma crystals of dust particles were found also in a

partially ionized plasma in a radio-frequency discharge10,11, in the DC glow discharge12

and in the UV - induced dusty plasmas under microgravity13.

It is now recognized that the plasma crystals are new material for future technologies.

Therefore, the investigation of several ordered structures in Coulomb systems plays an

important role.

II. INTERACTION MODELS

In this work we consider a fully ionized, dense (classical and semiclassical) hydrogen

2

plasma. The number density is considered in the range n = ne = ni ∼ (1019 ÷ 2 × 1025)

cm−

3, and the temperature domain is T ∼ (5 × 104 ÷ 106) K.

According to Ref. 14, we can separate a two types of dense plasma. For example at

θ ≫ 1 we have a classical dense plasma. Here θ = kBT /EF , kB denotes the Boltzmann

constant, T , EF are a temperature and the Fermi energy, respectively. In this case, the

quantum mechanical diﬀraction and symmetry eﬀects are negligible except in short-range

collisions. When θ < 0, 1, the electrons are in the state of full Fermi degeneracy. In the

intermediate region between these cases (θ ≤ 1), the electrons are partially degenerate

and we have a dense semiclassical plasma.

Due to the well known long range character of the Coulomb interaction between par-

ticles in plasma, the correlation eﬀects play an important role for dense plasma. Conse-

quently, for the dense plasma, the simultaneous interaction of a great number of particles

should be taken into account. In Ref. 15, an integro-diﬀerential equation for the eﬀec-

tive pair potential has been derived on the basis of Bogolyubov’s chain equation. This

equation takes into account simultaneous correlations of N particles. In the case of three

particle approximations the expression for the eﬀective potential for dense plasma is15,16:

Ψ(R) =

γ
R

e−

R 1 + γf (R)/2
1 + c(γ)

.

(1)

Here f (R) = (e−

√γR − 1)(1 − e−

2R)/5 and R = r/rD, where rD is the Debye screening

length. The potential is expressed in terms of the thermal energy, Ψ(R) = Φ(R)/kBT ,

and γ = e2/(rDkBT ) is a nonideality plasma parameter. c(γ) is the correction coeﬃcient

for diﬀerrent values of γ: c(γ) = −0.008617 + 0.455861γ − 0.108389γ2 + 0.009377γ3.

For the semiclassical plasma, the eﬀective potential of Kelbg-Deutsch-Yukhnovskii17,18

is usally used:

Φαβ(r) =

[1 − exp(−r/λαβ)] +

(2)

ZαZβe2
r

δαβδeαkBT ln(2) exp

−

r2
π ln(2)λ2

,

ee !

 

where λαβ = ¯h/(2πµαβkBT )1/2 is the thermal de Broglie wavelength; µαβ is the reduced

mass of electrons and ions. Notice that the eﬀective potential (2) does not account for

screening eﬀects in plasma and behaves like the Coulomb potential for r → ∞. There-

fore, in Ref. 19, the eﬀective semiclassical potential was obtained by applying the spline

approximation to potential (2) and the numerical solution of following Equation19:

∆Ψ − 3ΓΨ = ±3ΓΨ2,

Ψ |R

0= Γ/R ; Ψ |R

= 0

→

→∞

with the boundary conditions

at the intersection point.

(3)

(4)

The eﬀective potential Ψ(R) is expressed in units of kBT and R = r/a; ∆ is the

Laplace operator. In Equation (3) the minus and plus signs correspond to the interaction

of particles with equal and opposite charges, respectively. The spline approximation was

performed at the intersection point of Eq.(2) and the numerical solution of (3) – (4). This

potential contains quantum diﬀraction and symmetry eﬀects at short distances as well as

screening eﬀects for large distances (see Fig.1).

III. ORDERED STRUCTURES IN DENSE PLASMA

Following20, let us introduce a potential function for the mathematical description of

the system state. This function takes into account the collective interaction between the

components of statistical system:

U(~r, ~v, t) =

Φ(~r, ~v, ~r ′, ~v ′t)f (~r ′, ~v ′t)d~r ′d~v ′.

(5)

Here Φ(~r, ~v, ~r ′, ~v ′t) is the potential describing the interaction of particles in the system;

Z

4

~a, ~v are a coordinate and a velocity of particles, respectively.

If many-particles eﬀects are considered (e.g. three particle eﬀects), the expression for

U(~r, ~v, t) becomes non-linear:

U(~r, t) =

Φ12(|~r − ~r ′|)f (~r ′, ~v, t)d~r ′d~v +

Φ123(|~r − ~r ′| , |~r − ~r ′′| , |~r ′ − ~r ′′|)

(6)

Z

Z Z

f (~r ′, ~v ′, t)f (~r ′′, ~v ′′, t)d~r ′d~v ′~r ′′d~v ′′.

In the case of pair central interaction between particles we can written as

Φ(~r, ~v, ~r ′, ~v ′t) = Φ(|~r − ~r ′|).

Taking into consideration Eq.(7), the expression for potential function is obtained:

U(~r, t) =

Φ(|~r − ~r ′|)f (~r ′, ~v, t)d~r ′d~v.

Considering the eﬀective potentials and the ﬁeld of collective interactions, we can

obtain the following set of equations for the potential function U and plasma particles

density function ρ20:

where θ = 1/kBT ; C is the constant.

We consider20 the occurrence problem of space-periodical solution for Eq.(9). In this

case, the expression for U(~r) can be written in the following form:

ϕ(~r) = λ

Φef f (|~r − ~r ′|)eϕ(~r ′)d~r ′,

Z

where ϕ = −U/θ; λ = −C/θ. Let us that at λ = λ0 and ϕ = ϕ0 we have a violation of

space-uniform solution. Let λ = λ0 + ε, ϕ = ϕ0 + u(~r) and the equation for u(~r) is written

as:

ϕ0 + u(~r) = (λ0 + ε)

Φef f (|~r − ~r ′|)eϕ0+u(~r ′)d~r ′,

According to the occurrence problem of periodical structures from homogeneous medium,
the solution for u(~r) is sought as u(~r) = Aei~k~r. After inserting this solution into the Eq.

In the present work, the behavior of the function σ(k) is investigated for the above men-

tioned models of dense plasma; here k is a wave number.

The model of dense classical plasma is characterized by the fact that for the low limit

of integral (15) we must take a certain non-zero value of distance R0 = r/rD. In this case,

R0 is minimal distance between particles. In Figure 2, the results of numerical analysis

of expression (15) on the basis of eﬀective potential (1) are shown. Notice that, with

increasing of γ, on the dependencies of σ(k) some non-monotonic behavior are observed.

In this case, the increase of γ is caused by the density increase (the decreasing of rD). It

is well known that for a dense plasma the number of particles in Debye sphere ND < 1. It

is obtained also that functions σ(k) form local minimums when R0 ∼ 1 (r ≈ rD). These

facts can be interpreted as the formation of quasibound states in dense classical plasma.

The term ”quasibound” states21,22 denotes that the energy ε of electron-proton pairs is

6

−e2/a < ε ≤ 0. Because the size of ”quasibound” states is greater than a, it is considered

that the electron moves over a part of elliptical orbit in the ﬁeld of the nearest proton,

thereupon the electron passes into the ﬁeld of another proton, and so on.

For the model of dense semiclassical plasma, the problem of introduction of minimal

distance is absent because the pseudopotential (full line in Fig.1) is limited for r = 0 and

it is strongly screened when r → ∞. The results of numerical analysis of Eq. (15) are

represented in Figures 3,4 and 5 for diﬀerent values of the density parameter rs = a/aB

and the coupling parameter Γ = ZαZβe2/(akBT ). Here, a is the average distance between

particles and aB is the Bohr radius. It is shown that no oscillations on dependencies of

σee(k) for electron-electron component are observed. It is probably connected with the

fact that electrons do not form complexes (structures) between themselves because of

their little masses. The functions σep and σpp have pronounced oscillations that can be

considered as formation of ordered structures.

In Refs. 2,23 it has been demonstrated that in the intermediate region (1 ≤ Γ ≤ 150) the

plasma can be considered as a ordered structures of ions. According to this model, ions

form a cubic-like space structures due to the strong interactions between particles. Since

we have a chaotic motion in the system, these structures are realized ”on the average”.

Therefore, the energy of this structure is greater then Madelung’s energy of simple centered

cubic lattice. These conﬁgurations are called as ”ordered structures”.

Consequently in dense semiclassical hydrogen plasma, the “picture” of particles dis-

tribution can be as follows. Protons are distributed with a certain order and they are

surrounded by electron clouds. The “proton-electron” system can be considered as a

quasi-particle.

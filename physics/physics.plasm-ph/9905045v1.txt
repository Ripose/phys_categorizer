The Enskog-Landau kinetic equation is considered to describe non-equilibrium processes of a
mixture of charged hard spheres. This equation has been obtained in previous papers by means
of the non-equilibrium statistical operator method by D.N.Zubarev. The normal solution of this
kinetic equation found in the ﬁrst approximation using the standard Chapman-Enskog method is
given. On the basis of the found solution the ﬂows and transport coeﬃcients have been calculated.
All transport coeﬃcients for multicomponent mixture of spherical Coulomb particles are presented
analytically for the ﬁrst time. Numerical calculations of thermal conductivity and thermal diﬀusion
coeﬃcient are performed for some speciﬁc mixtures of noble gases of high density.

Construction of kinetic equations for dense gases and
plasma is one of the most important problems in the ki-
netic theory of classical systems. A sequential kinetic
theory of dense systems does not exist yet. The Enskog-
Landau kinetic equation has been obtained recently in [1]
to describe transport processes in non-equilibrium sys-
tem of charged hard spheres. This equation has its name
due to the structure of total collision integral. This in-
tegral contains terms of revised Enskog theory, kinetic
mean ﬁeld theory and Landau-like collision integral [2].
The inﬂuence of the last term on system behaviours has
been of our main interest. This term is caused by the
long-range interactions in a system. In particular, it was
shown [2] that in the case of small densities and weak
interactions the force autocorrelation function and the
entire last term in the total collision integral converts to
the usual Landau collision integral for a rareﬁed plasma.

The new kinetic equation and its collision integral are
adequate only for systems which can be modelled by
charged hard spheres. The great credit for this result
is shared by a choice of interparticle interaction poten-
tial in additive-like form: hard spheres interaction plus
certain “smooth” long-range part (Coulomb interaction
in our case). It allowed to avoid divergency at short dis-
tances. Unfortunately, a logarithmic divergency at long
distances still remains, and to eliminate it one should in-
troduce a cut-oﬀ radius of integration (like a Debye one).
But unlike the classical Debye formula, in this case we
used a modiﬁed one, which takes into account particle
sizes σ. For the Enskog-Landau kinetic equation [1] a
normal solution has been found by means of the stan-
dard Chapman-Enskog method. A stress tensor Π and
heat ﬂow vector q have been obtained as well. Expres-
sions for transport coeﬃcients like bulk κ and shear η
viscosities and thermal conductivity λ have been derived
from structures of Π and q. Numerical calculation of
transport coeﬃcients for neutral and once-ionized argon
shows a good agreement between the theory and exper-

imental data. In [3,4] these results were generalized to
non-stationary non-equilibrium process. Whereas to ﬁnd
the normal solution the Chapman-Enskog method [5] is
used in [1,2], the much more powerful method of bound-
ary conditions [6] is used in [3,4].
In the limiting case
of a stationary non-equilibrium process, the results of [4]
completely convert to those of [1]. For hydrodynamic de-
scription of fast processes it is better to use the method
of boundary conditions [6].

Application of the theory to a multicomponent system
was performed step-by-step. The Enskog-Landau kinetic
equation for M -component (M > 2) mixture of charged
hard spheres has been proposed in [7]. Just the same,
the normal solution, ﬂows and transport coeﬃcients have
been found by means of the standard Chapman-Enskog
method for a two-component system only. New transport
coeﬃcients which appear in multicomponent systems are
mutual diﬀusion Dαβ and thermal diﬀusion Dα
T coeﬃ-
cients (here α,β are mixture indices). Numerical calcula-
tion of the obtained transport coeﬃcients showed a good
agreement between the developed theory, experimental
data, results of other theories and MD simulations.

In view of identifying of a normal solution of the kinetic
equation for a multicomponent system of charged parti-
cles results of [7] are not the ﬁrst. Namely, it is worthy
to note that the normal solution of the kinetic equation
for completely ionized plasma is found in [8] using the
standard Chapman-Enskog method in the 3rd approx-
imation. But dense systems of ﬁnite size particles are
consistently considered for the ﬁrst time in our papers
[1–4,7].

In this letter we present our solution of the Enskog-
Landau kinetic equation for a multicomponent mixture
of charged hard spheres. Similarly to [7], we use the stan-
dard Chapman-Enskog method. It is known [5] that the
correction expression for one-particle distribution func-
tion in the ﬁrst approximation can be chosen in two dif-
ferent ways. According to the ﬁrst one described in [9],

the correction for one-particle distribution function of α-
kind is proportional to dα – a diﬀusion thermodynamic
force of α-kind only. The second way is proposed in [5].
In this case the correction is proportional to a certain su-
perposition of diﬀusion thermodynamic forces of all com-
ponents of a mixture. It was shown [10] that the second
method gives much better results because, unlike the ﬁrst
method, after crossing to linear thermodynamics equa-
tions it is important that Onsager’s reciprocal relations
obey. Nevertheless, in [7] for a two-component system
we used the ﬁrst method because the complication (or
generalization) like in [5] is essential for two-component
systems in some cases only. Namely, when the density of
particle number of some mixture component (or compo-
nents) is not conserved. Such a situation can be realized
in gas mixtures where chemical reactions between com-
ponents may take place, or in multicomponent mixtures,
where transitions between states with diﬀerent internal
degree of freedoms are possible.

Let us consider the Enskog-Landau kinetic equation

while r and p denote the Cartesian coordinate and par-

equation has an additive structure

Icoll = IHS + IMF + IL

and each term in (2) is deﬁned like in [7]: the ﬁrst one
is from so-called hard sphere part of interparticle inter-
action – collision integral of the revized Enskog theory
RET; the second one is caused by taking into account
of long-range interparticle interaction in the mean ﬁeld
approximation KMFT (this term is of the ﬁrst order in
interaction); and, ﬁnally, the third one is the so-called
Landau-like collision term (it is of the second order in in-
teraction). In the limit of a system of point-like charged
particles of low density, the collision integral (2) trans-
forms to the usual Landau collision integral [11,12]. Fol-
lowing a concept of consistent description of kinetics and
hydrodynamics of non-equilibrium processes [13–16], ki-
netic equation (1) should be solved together with local
conservation laws [4] for additive invariants. These ad-
ditive invariants in collisions (or scattering) of charged
hard spheres are mass (or total density), momentum and
total energy [5,9,11,12]. It should be noted that for rar-
eﬁed systems it was suﬃcient to consider kinetic energy
only, while in dense systems potential interaction energy
is essential and cannot be neglected.

are nothing but coeﬃcients of expansion in the Sonine-
Laguerre polynomials. Their general deﬁnition for an
arbitrary potential of interaction is given in [5]. The cal-
culations for a special case of a two-component mixture
is performed in [7]. All the obtained quantities Bα(0),
Aα(0), Aα(1) and Eαβ(0) ultimately depend on the so-
called Ω-integrals.

Numerical calculation for transport coeﬃcients κ, η,
λ, Dα
T and Dαβ has been performed. For two- and
three-component mixtures of neutral and charged hard
spheres we studied the dependences of transport coef-
ﬁcients on density, temperature, and concentration ra-
tio of some mixture components [17]. There are a lot
of approaches which allow to calculate viscosity with a
suﬃcient accuracy [14–16]. However, these approaches
do not allow to calculate well thermal conductivity for
dense and moderately dense systems. Our theory is de-
void of such a circumstance. This is reached due to the

following: ﬁrstly, the Enskog-Landau kinetic equation
is obtained by means of the non-equilibrium statistical
operator method from the ﬁrst principles of statistical
mechanics without phenomenological assumptions; sec-
ondly, kinetics and hydrodynamics in the studied systems
are considered simultaneously. The last factor is very im-
portant for dense and moderately dense systems [13–16].
As a result, we obtain a good agreement between the
theory and experimental data. In Fig. 1 we present the
concentration ratio dependences of some transport coef-
ﬁcients for two- and three-component mixtures. In this
case, the total concentration is considered to be constant.
Fig. 1 b) illustrates the limiting cases for the thermal dif-
T of a system Ar+–Kr+ when xKr →
fusion coeﬃcient Dα
0
1, that is for one-component systems. In this
or xKr →
case, diﬀusion thermodynamic forces vanish and thermal
diﬀusion vanishes too. Presently the results of calcula-
tion of other transport coeﬃcients are not published too
[17].

From the present letter, one can draw the following
conclusions. The obtained Enskog-Landau kinetic equa-
tion for charged hard spheres turned out to be very useful
for several purposes. First of all, the collision integral of
this equation does not contain a divergency at small dis-
tances. Secondly, the normal solution and all transport
coeﬃcients have analytical structure. They can be easily
used to study some speciﬁc systems. Finally, the analyt-
ical structure of transport coeﬃcients allows us to ﬁnd
fast and easily systems, which can be best described by
the obtained kinetic equation, as well as density and tem-
perature ranges, where the agreement between the theory
and experimental data is the closest.

The next step in this theory is to calculate a dynamical
screening radius in a system. Partially this problem has
been already solved in our recent paper [18].

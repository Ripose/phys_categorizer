Abstract

The derivation of the ponderomotive force due to neutrinos by Hardy and

Melrose [Phys.Rev.D 54, 6491 (1996)] is based on a ﬂawed analysis of the

ponderomotive force concept. Their conclusions also contain an erroneous

physical assumption related to the neutrino emission in supernovae. A correct

analysis shows the importance of the ponderomotive force due to neutrinos in

type II supernovae explosions.

Ref. [1] presents several results related with the ponderomotive force of the neutrinos,

and its role in supernovae explosions. Several claims are in contradiction with some of the

results presented in their own ref. [1] and the results already published in the literature.

Using the methods of Quantum Plasmadynamics, a generalization of Finite Temperature

Quantum Field Theory, the mass correction of a single electron due to the presence of a

neutrino medium is derived (eq.(15) in ref. [1], or eq.(15. [1])). This mass correction is

equivalent to an eﬀective potential describing the eﬀect of a background of neutrinos on

single electron dynamics. It describes the electron mass correction due to weak interactions

with the neutrinos, and it is the electron counterpart of the eﬀective potential felt by the

neutrinos in a background of electrons [3]. From their eq.(15. [1]), it would be straight-

forward to calculate the force exerted by the neutrino medium on a single electron (which

would be just

Veﬀ). However, Hardy and Melrose ﬁrst perform a sum over all the elec-

−∇

trons in the medium, eq.(16. [1]), and only then the gradient of the energy density is taken.

By taking a sum over all the electrons, the total energy density of the medium composed of

neutrinos and electrons is calculated. Therefore the “ponderomotive force” in eq.(19. [1]) is,

in fact, the force of the neutrino+electron ﬂuid over some test ﬂuid element (interacting via

the weak interaction force), and, in this sense, it includes the ponderomotive force due to

the neutrinos (associated with gradients in the neutrino number density) and the pondero-

motive force due to the electrons (associated with gradients in the electron number density).

Therefore, equation (17. [1]) does not describe the force exerted by the neutrino medium

over the electrons, as it is claimed. This misinterpretation occurs due to the deﬁnition of

the ponderomotive force used in [1], which can be written as the gradient of the energy

density of the neutrino ﬂuid itself (in analogy with the approach of Manheimer [2] for the

electromagnetic ﬁeld), but cannot be expressed as the gradient of the energy density of the

neutrino+electron ﬂuid, as represented by Hardy and Melrose [1] in eq.(19. [1]).

This discrepancy is even more evident from eq.(15. [1]), where δm is the electron mass

correction due to a neutrino medium.

In this case the eﬀective Hamiltonian for a single

electron is written as

with p the electron momentum and me the electron rest mass, and where we have assumed

that

trino distribution functions. From eqs.(12,13,14. [1]), we easily obtain the electron eﬀective

which agrees with other derivations of the ponderomotive force due to neutrinos [4]. This

result is in clear contradiction with the force derived in ref. [1] (eq.(27. [1]), when n−

e = 0).

According to [1], and using eq.(27. [1]), the “ponderomotive force” exerted on a single

electron is ˜F/n+

e , which is clearly diﬀerent from eq.(3). Also, in the treatment of Hardy and

Melrose, no interaction is assumed between the electrons. Thus, it is physically unreasonable

that the ponderomotive force felt by a single electron due to the neutrinos is dependent on

the electron density as eq.(27. [1]) implies.

After deriving the force due to neutrinos, the authors of ref. [1] apply their results

to type II supernovae explosions.

In doing so, they discard the contribution of the term

corresponding to eq.(3), arguing that “All species of neutrinos and antineutrinos are thought

to be produced in the neutrino burst in roughly equal quantities”. However, the physical

scenario in a type II supernovae explosion does not conﬁrm this claim [5]. Prior to the

launching of the shock wave into the outer core, the neutrino signal is dominated only

by electron neutrinos. These electron neutrinos (νe) are produced by electron capture on

protons, both free and bound in heavy nuclei. The νe luminosity reaches a peak just after

the shock wave has moved outside the neutrinosphere (t

350 ms), as the free protons,

≈

produced by shock dissociation of the iron, capture electrons, and a strong νe burst is

4

emitted [5]. This deleptonization pulse is about 5 ms long and accounts for about 1% of the

total energy released in neutrinos of all ﬂavors. After this strong deleptonization, neutrinos

of all ﬂavors are thermally produced by e+e− annihilation reactions, and the bulk of the

energy is emitted in neutrinos of all ﬂavors on neutrino-diﬀusion timescales (

much smaller than the luminosity of the electron neutrinos (Lνe

Hence, it is clear that during the νe burst, the component of the ponderomotive force

associated with the gradient of the neutrino number density plays a dominant role when

compared with the component associated with the anisotropies of the neutrino distribution

function. For typical parameters occurring in a supernovae, the ratio between the pondero-

motive force

(as given by eq.(3)), and the single neutrino-electron collisional force is

During the thermal neutrino emission phase, all types of neutrino ﬂavors are produced,

and the role of the ponderomotive force is still important:

from eq.(3) we note that the

antineutrinos will push the electrons in the opposite direction to the neutrinos but, due to

the opposite eﬀective potential aﬀecting the neutrinos and antineutrinos [7], the neutrinos

will bunch in the regions of lower electron density while the antineutrinos bunch in the regions

of higher electron density. The ponderomotive force due to neutrinos and antineutrinos act

together to reinforce the density modulations and will still be a fundamental ingredient for

this instability scenario [8,9].

In conclusion, we have shown in this comment the analysis of Hardy and Melrose [1]

of the ponderomotive force due to neutrinos contains some misinterpretations, leading to a

physically unrealistic expression for the force of the neutrinos on the electrons. A proper

analysis of their formalism gives the correct expression for the ponderomotive force due

to neutrinos. Furthermore, an erroneous assumption about the neutrino and antineutrino

species emitted during the neutrino burst, led Hardy and Melrose [1] to the conclusion of

the irrelevance of the ponderomotive force during supernovae explosions. However, a correct

description of the neutrino spectra produced during the neutrino burst [5] shows that the

5

ponderomotive force due to neutrinos in type II supernovae explosions can impact in a

signiﬁcant way the plasma electrons dynamics. During the thermal neutrino emission, the

ponderomotive force of all ﬂavors still acts as the streaming instability driving mechanism,

contributing to the closure of the instability feedback loop. Our conclusion is that the

ponderomotive force due to neutrinos can play an important role in the explosion mechanism

of type II supernovae.

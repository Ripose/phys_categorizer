Abstract.

We have investigated apparently stochastic ﬂuctuations of magnetically-supported
dc discharge in cylindrical coaxial conﬁguration. In the system the electric ﬁeld had
radial direction while the magnetic ﬁeld was applied axially. The discharge vessel
length was 12 centimetres. Working gas was typically argon at pressure of several Pa,
magnetic ﬁeld 10-50 mT.

The contribution describes experimental results - frequency and phase analysis of
the instabilities, which we detected in our experimental system in both the conventional
and inverted magnetron conﬁgurations.

We bring also 2-D PIC model of the dc discharge under conditions, which can be
achieved in the experimental apparatus. The PIC model should answer questions,
which originated from the experimental study of the plasma parameters – presented
e.g. in [1].

A study of magnetically-supported dc discharge in cylindrical conﬁguration

1. Introduction

Magnetically-supported dc discharges in cylindrical symmetry (cylindrical magnetrons)
are used for deposition of high-temperature superconducting materials, see e.g.
[2],
or materials with special dielectric characteristics, see e.g.
[3]. Understanding the
behavior of the dc discharge in such conﬁguration is therefore essential condition for
the technological progress in this branch. The magnetron systems with cylindrical
symmetry are relatively simple and thus the plasma processes in them can be simulated
comparatively easily by computer models. Measurements of plasma parameters in
cylindrical magnetron can thus be compared with theoretical predictions and/or
calculations used for their veriﬁcation.

In this contribution results of the potential ﬂuctuations measurements and 2-D
PIC modelling are brought. As we presented in former papers, e.g. [1], by the study of
axial and radial dependence of the plasma parameters, the axial inhomogeneities were
observed, which couldn’t be reproduced by the 1-D PIC model. The 2-D model was
then used to try to explain the presence of the local minimum of the plasma density
in the middle of the discharge vessel. Further research has been done in this direction
and we bring new results of the calculations. In connection with the diﬀerences between
computer models and the experimental results, importance is often attached to the
plasma ﬂuctuations. To answer the question how big role play the ﬂuctuations in
our system, we measured potential ﬂuctuations with two parallel probes and evaluated
frequency spectra as well as a correlation of the signals from the both probes to check
presence of coherent modes [4] in the discharge.

2. Experimental

2.1. Experimental setup

The cylindrical magnetron in the so-called post discharge conﬁguration consists of
cylindrical cathode mounted coaxially inside the anode. The discharge volume is axially
limited by means of two disc-shaped limiters, which are connected to the cathode
potential. Our device is schematically depicted in Fig. 1, the electrodes conﬁguration
is shown in Fig. 2. The diameters of the cathode and anode are 10 mm and 60 mm,
respectively. The length of the discharge volume is 120 mm. The homogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld is created by two coils and is in parallel with the common axis of the system. To
prevent overheating the coils and cathode, the system is cooled by water.

The apparatus is constructed as high vacuum. The pumping unit consists of the
combination of the turbomolecular and rotary pumps. The ultimate presure is in the
order of 10−3 Pa. During the operation of the magnetron discharge the working gas,
in this case argon, slowly ﬂows into the system and through the valve reducing the
pumping speed of the pumps leaves the system. The typical ﬂow rate is below 1 sccm
and is adjusted by means of the MKS ﬂow controller in order to keep the pressure in
the discharge volume constant.

The system is equipped with several diagnostic ports, see Fig. 1. One of them
can be used to install a radially movable Langmuir probe. Axially movable probe can
be installed using the port at the side of the vacuum vessel. For measurements of
the plasma potential ﬂuctuations the axial movable probe holder was used to enable
measuring with a mean of two Langmuir probes placed as clear from Fig. 1.

2.2. Estimation of the power spectra

The Langmuir probes were used in ﬂoating regime, i.e. without the applied bias voltage.
The ﬂoating potential signal was sampled using the digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS
610) and samples hn were transferred to the computer over the GPIB interface

hn = h(n.∆t),

(1)

where h(t) is the probe voltage with respect to the anode, ∆t is the sampling interval
and integer n ranges from 0 to the number of samples N − 1. Then the discrete Fourier

The guess of the Fourier transform of the voltage h(t) at the discrete frequencies k.∆f

where ∆f = (N.∆t)−1. The power density is then

S(f ) =

In order to decrease the scatter of the calculated spectrum estimate several realizations
(typically 100) were averaged into the resulting power density curve.

2.3. Frequency vs. wave number spectra

In order to analyze the wave behavior of the potential ﬂuctuations of the magnetron
discharge the spectra derived from the ﬂuctuations measured simultaneously from two
Langmuir probes were evaluated according to the method [4]. At ﬁrst the wave number
can be expressed for each frequency from the phase shift between the signals at the two
probes and known distance ∆x between the probes:

k(f ) =

argH (2)(f ) − argH (1)(f )
∆x
Using the wave number and the average power density at two probes 1
the histogram S(f, k) can be built.

Figure 3. Frequency wave number histograms of the argon dc discharge in cylindrical
magnetron in conventional arrangement at pressure 2.5 Pa and 3 Pa and at magnetic
ﬁeld 20 mT.

In Figure 3 there is shown an example of the frequency wave number histograms,
evaluated from the simultaneous measurements with two probes at diﬀerent discharge
powers in the non-inverted conﬁguration. The z-axis (power density axis) is showed as
a tone of grey and darker areas at certain frequencies mean that the two signals are
correlated with given phase shift. There can be seen certain coherent modes especially
in Figures 3c through f.

The potential ﬂuctuations of the discharge in the inverted conﬁguration were also
investigated. However, although the measurements were done within wide range of
powers and pressures, no observable coherent modes were detected in argon discharge.

3. PIC model

Plasma modeling techniques can be divided into two basic families with respect to the
plasma description: codes using kinetic description and codes using ﬂuid description of
plasma. The technique of our interest – Particle-In-Cell (PIC) technique e.g.
[5, 6, 7]
– belongs among the codes that use kinetic description of plasma. In PIC technique
there are solved equations of motion for all charged particles in plasma. Computation
of mutual electrical forces is in the PIC approach transformed to the solving of Poisson

equation in the simulated region. A great advantage of this technique is that it is
self-consistent. On the other hand self-consistent approach is compensated by great
computational eﬀort (especially in 2D and 3D simulations).

The electrostatic Particle-In-Cell computational scheme consists of the following

steps:

1. Division of simulated region to cells.
2. Assignment of the charge of particles to the mesh points.
3. Computing of electric ﬁeld.
4. Particles move in calculated ﬁeld.
5. Jump to point 2.
Although results of XOOPIC simulation presented here are in relatively good
agreement with the experiment there is a problem with numerical instability of the
simulation – with a growing number of computational particles during simulation.
Hence, the computational model needs further improvement. A discharge current source
may be implemented into the code to help to solve this problem. In future work, we hope
to bring with our simulation model a more detailed study of the discharge in cylindrical
magnetron and more precise comparison with experiment.

In Figure 5 there are shown the results of the PIC modeling of the dc discharge

in argon in the cylindrical magnetron apparatus described above. The model was done
under the the following conditions: magnetic ﬁeld strength 20 mT, pressure 5 Pa, voltage
200 V, time step 5 ps, simulation time 23.8 µs. Grid size was 40 in axial direction and
100 in radial direction.

Conclusion

We measured potential ﬂuctuations and evaluated the correlation between two probes
placed parallel in the discharge. The coherent modes similar to those observed in [4] were
found under certain conditions in the non-inverted cylindrical magnetron conﬁguration.
The 2-D PIC model was used to calculate plasma parameters under the same
conditions, which can be established in the experimental apparatus. The results of the
electron density and plasma potential were presented. The model results qualitatively
agree with experimental observations [1, 8, 9, 10], further eﬀort in modeling is still
needed.

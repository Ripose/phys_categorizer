ABSTRACT

An experimental investigation of a new interaction connected with the existence of the cosmological
vectorial potential, has been carried out. On its basis, a new method of energy generation with
the use of a plasma generator, has been studied. The experimental results are presented.

1. Introduction

In Refs.

[1-8], a new interaction of the objects in nature, diﬀerent from four
known interactions (the strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational ones), has
been predicted. The new force is caused by the existence of the cosmological vectorial
potential Ag, a new fundamental vectorial constant appearing in the deﬁnition of
byuons, new discrete objects (physical dimension of byuons are as of the electrical
charge, magnetic ﬂux, Dirac’s monopole - the same in CGSE system). According
to the hypothesis suggested in Refs. [1,7,8], in minimization of the potential energy
of interaction between the byuons in the one-dimensional space formed by them,
the observable physical space as well as the world of elementary particles together
In this model, the masses of the particles are
with their properties, are arising.
proportional to the modulus of the summary potential AΣ, consisting of Ag and
the vectorial potentials of various magnetic sources as of natural origin (the Earth’s
and Sun’s potentials, etc.) so artiﬁcial ones (for example, the vectorial potentials
A of magnetic ﬁelds of solenoids, plasma generators, etc.). The magnitude |AΣ| is
always lesser then |Ag| ≈ 1.95 × 1011Gs · cm [1-8].

In distinction to the gauge theory (for example, the classic and quantum ﬁeld
[1,7,8] the values of potentials acquire a physical
theory), in the model of Refs.
meaning in tune with the known Aharonov’s-Bohm’s eﬀect [9,10] being a special
case of the space quantum properties described in Ref. [8].

The magnitude of the new force is F ∼ ∆A

, where ∆A is the diﬀerence
in changes of AΣ between the points at which the sensor and test body are placed
[1,7,8], x is the coordinate in space. According to the ground-based experiments
with high-current magnets [2-5], with a gravimeter and a magnet attached to it
[11,12], the experiments on investigating the changes in β-decay rate of radioactive

elements [13,14], and the astrophysical observations [15-17], Ag has the following
estimated coordinates in the second equatorial system: the right ascension α ≈ 270◦,
the declination δ ≈ 34◦.

The new force ejects any substance from the region of diminished |AΣ| mainly in
direction of Ag. The most eﬀective angle between the vector A of a current system
and the vector Ag is 150 ÷ 140◦ [8].

In the investigations with high-current magnets (magnetic ﬂux density up to
15T), the magnitude of the new force was equal to ∼ (0.01 ÷ 0.08)g at the 30g mass
of the test body.
It was shown in experiments with rotating magnetic discs and
an engine-generator [18-20] that the magnitude of the force F can be considerably
increased when to phase the motion of the body with the process of formation of the
physical space from the byuons (i.e. the working body is bound to change AΣ by
its potential A and move in the direction of the vector Ag. Therewith its particles
are to rotate in the proper side). In this case the energy will be extracted from the
physical space through the elementary particles of the working body. The low of
energy conservation in the system ”working body-physical space” will be obeyed. It
is known that the main part (∼ 98%) of energy in the Universe is determined by the
”dark” (virtual) matter [21]. The model of Refs. [1,7,8] describes the phenomenon
of the ”dark matter” quite satisfactorily.

2. The experimental installation and technique.

To test the above said, a special stationary plasma generator with linear discharge
(see Fig.1) has been manufactured at the Central Research Institute of Machinery.
The plasma generator (1) (power ∼ 60kW , current I ∼ 300A, voltage U ∼ 220V )
is arranged on a rotatable base and can be turned together with the whole instru-
mentation through 320 degrees around the vertical axis (2) and through 90◦ around
horizontal axis. The plasma generator is water-cooled (3). As a working medium
air (4) admixed with argon (∼ 1%) was used. A measuring tube from copper (6) of
internal diameter 0.8cm was fastened to the plasma generator by means of a holder
(5) at 8cm from the nozzle exit section. The temperature of water drawing through
the tube was ∼ 16◦C. The arrangement of the measuring tube relative to the plume
(7) of the plasma generator is shown in Fig.1. In the center of the section of the
measuring tube at the inlet and outlet of water, the junctions of Chromel-Alumel
thermocouples (8) 0.2mm in diameter were mounted. The percent change in tem-
perature of junctions of thermocouples ∆T was ﬁxed by a recorder with the accuracy
class ∼ 0.4%. The tape advance of 25cm corresponded to 1mV of thermoelectrical
voltage, i.e. to ∆T ≈ 25◦.

The plasma generator current and voltage were read with an accuracy of 1.5% of
the limiting values for the instruments used (750A and 500V , respectively). The ﬂow
rate of water through the cooled measuring tube was ﬁxed to within 3% (∼ 60g/s).
The mass velocity V of particles in the plasma generator jet was equal to 120m/s.
The ionization coeﬃcient in the jet was ∼ 0.1%. The initial experiments were

2

performed in the following manner. First, a point in time was chosen at which
the vector Ag was close to the horizontal plane. Further, the starting direction of
plasma generator jet was set up at an arbitrary angle to the presumed direction of
Ag. When the plasma generator was in the operating conditions and the readings
from the thermocouples corresponded to a stationary regime (∆T = Const), one
began to turn the plasma generator in the horizontal plane together with the whole
instruments around the vertical axis at ∼ 5◦ a second. At this instant, the recorder
ﬁxed the value of the angle and the corresponding ∆T .

3. The results of experiments.

In Figs. 2 and 3 the results of two experiments carried out in February 10,1998,
at 950, and in March 20, 1998, at 745 (Moscow time), are shown. In the ﬁrst of them
the plasma generator was turned counterclockwise from some arbitrary angle. As
is seen from Fig.2, a considerable increase in ∆T reaching 40% of the stationary
condition was observed close to an angle of 225◦. In Fig.3 we also see a substantial
rise in ∆T (∼ 20%) nearby 120◦ ÷150◦ when turning the plasma generator clockwise
beginning from another arbitrary angle. In the ﬁrst experiment, the turn angle of
the plasma generator equal to 225◦ corresponded to the angle α ∼ 340◦ of the
maximum action of the new force. In the second experiment this maximum action
corresponded to the average value α ∼ 260◦. Because the angles of maximum action
of the new force lie on the left and on the right of the vector Ag, and the force along
the direction of Ag itself is zero [8], the initial experiments have given the direction
of AΣ with the coordinates α ∼ 300◦, δ ∼ 34◦ (the vectors Ag and AΣ are almost
parallel). Therewith the angle between the vector A of the current in the plasma
generator discharge and the vector Ag for maximum action of the new force was
140◦ for the ﬁrst and 130◦ for the second experiments, respectively.

3

In the second run of experiments carried out by day since June 29, till July
02,1998, the optimum angle β the jet made to the horizontal plane, was sought
because at that period the vector Ag was nearly horizontal only by nights. At
β = 0 and when turning the plasma generator around the vertical axis through
320◦, the new force did not manifest itself at all. As the angle β was spaced at 15◦
intervals, at β = 30◦ the maximum inﬂection of the ∆T - curve during rotation of
the plasma generator around the vertical line was observed. In various experiments
these inﬂections corresponded to the following coordinates of the maximum action
of the new force: α ≈ 255◦, α ≈ 340◦, and β ≈ 30◦. That is, the coordinates of the
vector Ag practically had not changed and were equal to α ≈ 297◦ and β ≈ 30◦.

Altogether there were carried out more than 20 experiments in 1998. All of them
revealed (with an accuracy of ∼ 20◦) only two directions in space relative to the
vector Ag corresponding to maximum ∆T (see above). The summary statistic error
including also random non-controllable processes (in the discharge of the plasma
generator, in the ﬂow of water nearly the thermocouples in the measuring tube etc.)
was equal to ∼ 15% in each individual experiment on determining ∆T . The latter
is clearly seen in Fig.2. It is necessary to note that this result was obtained not
only in the experiments with rotation of the plasma generator from an arbitrary
angle but ﬁve months later as well (when the Earth turned through ∼ 150◦ about
the Sun). In the course of the experiments, the bendings of water and gas hoses

4

were insigniﬁcant and did not inﬂuence the experimental result. The action of the
Coriolis force was unimportant, too.
It is interesting to note that the results of
experiments carried out in February 1998 and 1999 at the same days and hours,
are qualitatively coincident (with an accuracy of ∼ 20% and with some common
turn of the whole ﬁeld of directions of the new force through ∼ 20◦). As in 1998,
in 1999 also two directions of this force with a diﬀerence in α - coordinate equal
to ∼ 90◦, were prominent. For the experiments of February 1999, the coordinates
of the vector Ag calculated by the same procedure are α ≈ 280◦ and β ≈ 30◦. It
should be pointed out that the manifestation of the new force on the left or the right
of Ag was accidental, i.e. we could not precisely predict when this force will be ﬁxed
by us in the process of turning the plasma generator: before or after the passage
of jet direction through the presumed direction of Ag. In roughly 30 experiments
performed by us the force manifested itself after that passage approximately twice
as frequently as before.

In Fig.4 shown are (in the projection onto the plane of celestial equator, δ = 0)
the direction of action of the new force F and that of the vector Ag, determined
from ∆T change in the plasma generator jet, for typical experiments performed in
various day times and months of the year (the direction of the new force for other
experiments are within the range of its direction shown in Fig. 4). As is seen, the
new force directions in space are obviously not accidental, two of them (indicated
above) are prominent.

4. Addendum

In the Central Research Institute of Machinery, the thermophysical properties
of constructional materials in the jet of a plasma generator with linear discharge
1MW in power, were investigated for more than ten years.
In some instances,
while estimating the heat content of the jet with the aid of a local calorimeter, a
considerable excess of energy released in the jet above the energy taken from the
power source, was observed at ﬁxed operating parameters of the plasma generator
(I = (500 ÷ 1800)A; V = (3000 ÷ 3500)m/s). The results of estimation of the total
energy at the output of the plasma generator were obtained by way of computations.
In three last experiments (two of them were carried out in Oct. 22, 1992, at
1430, 1500, and one was in Apr. 22, 1994, at 1500), integral calorimetric measurements
in the jet of the 1MW plasma generator were fulﬁlled by means of a non-stationary
calorimeter crossing the jet in a matter of 0.2 second. The duration of stationary
operation of the plasma generator was equal to 30 − 40s, the error of measurements
was ∼ ±20%. The ratio of energy output W1 to input W0 equaled ∼ 1 in the
experiments of 1992 but the measurements in 1994 have given W1/W0 ≈ 2 which
was much more than the error of the experimental technique used. The latter fact
also lent an impetus to conducting the above described experiments with plasma
generator. An analysis of spatial arrangement of the axis of plasma generator relative
to the vector Ag has shown that in the experiments of 1992, the eﬀect of increasing
energy in the jet was to be totally absent but in the experiment carried out in 1994,
by contrast, the plasma generator jet was just at the most eﬃcient angle (∼ 30◦)
to Ag. Therewith the angle between the vector A of the current of the plasma
generator and the vector Ag was equal to ∼ 150◦.

Since 1976 till 1982 in the Research Center of High-Voltage Equipment (Moscow),
a run of experiments was performed by V.P.Ignatko and others on investigation of
alternating high current electric arc in the closed volume of transformer oil in a
unique experimental set-up having no analogues in the world. The root-mean-square
current was varied through a range of 20−130kA with the amplitude values no more
than 200kA. The period of current oscillations was equal to 0.02s, the duration
of arc discharge was ∼ 1s. The electric set-up was made up of two shock-exited
electric machine oscillators of TI-100-2 type in a double transformation circuit,
and delivered up to 12kV of r.m.s. no-load voltage. The oil of volume (0.6 ÷ 1)m3
was inclosed in a vertical cylindric tank from steel ∼ 3m in height and ∼ 1m in
diameter weighing about 7t. The arc burned in oil between hemispheric copper
electrodes 7cm in diameter initially placed (0.5 ÷ 5)cm apart in the middle plane of
the cylinder between its bottom and cover. The current, voltage, power and energy
of the arc, pressure at various points of the experimental model, and deformations of
the whole construction investigated, were measured. The process was ﬁlmed. More
than 100 experiments were carried out. In some of them (∼ 8) anomal phenomena
were observed - a tendency to current suppression without apparent reasons for that.
So, in an experiment in Oct. 7, 1976, at 2200, the current at its third and ﬁfth half-

7

periods decreased from 186kA to 8.7kA and 3.3kA (i.e. tens times) until the arc
decayed 0.05 second after. In a time of 0.05s, 5.55MJ of energy were transferred
to the arc. That experiment was ﬁnished by an accident. Uncontrollable energy
release in the arc took place, and the pressure in the vertical direction was built
up to 120atm which terminated in deﬂection of the cover of the cylinder (8cm in
thickness) by 1cm and emergence of a crack of width up to 0.2cm. An analysis
of the process have shown that the energy released in the arc turned out to be
about an order higher than the expenditure of energy. The experiment performed
in June 10, 1982, at 2035, in which the arc current equaled 38.5kA, the energy
imparted accounted for 31.2MJ, the initial gap between the electrodes was equal to
∼ 2cm (these are common, far from limiting parameters for the set up in question),
led to an explosion. The seven-tonne cylinder broke away from screw anchors and
rose up having destroyed the ceiling. Examination of deformations occurred and
estimation, on their basis, of arc energy by a joint commission have shown that
there were released in the arc 10-100 times more energy than was communicated to
it. The government commission could not ﬁnd reasons for the accident in the limits
of existing physical and chemical knowledge. Analysis of spatial arrangement of the
center line of the set-up electrodes has led to a conclusion that in the latter case it
made the most eﬃcient angle with the vector Ag (for the action of the new force),
and in the experiments of 07.10.76 the angle between that line and Ag was very close
to the most eﬃcient. The above mentioned phenomenon of abnormal suppression of
current, inexplicable on the basis of the existing electrical engineering and physics,
also can be explained by the action of the new force.

Thus the material of the present paper and the whole complex of investigations
of properties and characteristics of the new force as well as of the global anisotropy
of space due to existence of the vector Ag, testify that we have detected a new source
of energy connected to the energy of the physical space. This energy can be used
with the aid of various current-carrying systems acting by potentials on elementary
particles through which the energy comes to us.

Abstract

We draw attention on the fast oscillatory deviations from the residual
non-ambipolarity in the case where electrons are driven by strong mag-
netic perturbations.

If the turbulent diﬀusion of the electrons and ions are diﬀerent one can
expect that a radial electric ﬁeld develops (such that the ambipolarity is rein-
stored) and that poloidal plasma spin-up can occur. However it has been shown
that the diﬀusion of particles in turbulent ﬁelds is ambipolar. In Ref.[1] the dif-
ference in the radial ﬂuxes generated by ﬂuctuating ﬁelds has been considered
and the rˆole of the ion polarization drift has been underlined. The radial ion
ﬂux partially cancels the radial electron ﬂux and the ambipolarity is reestab-
lished approximately, to the order 1/ε⊥, which is a very small quantity (ε⊥ is
the plasma transversal permitivity constant). The problem has been examined
in detail for instabilities having a substantial magnetic component in Ref.[2].
When the unstable modes that drive the radial transport are bounded inside
plasma (i.e. it can be assumed that there is no exchange of momentum with the
region outside plasma) the ﬂuxes are ambipolar in average over a spatial region
including several mode-resonance surfaces. Pointwise non-zero radial currents,
even reduced by the fraction 1/ε⊥, are able to build up charge ﬁlaments and
can cause the plasma to be Kelvin Helmholtz unstable.

We return to this problem to examine a situation where the non-ambipolarity
is switched on by an external source acting on the electron component. We
assume that the electrons are radially driven by a magnetic perturbation which
imposes a constant radial ﬂux starting at t = 0. The ion polarization drift
re-establishes the equality of the ﬂuxes (to order 1/ε⊥) but in this particular
case a stationary equilibrium cannot be reached. The existence of a radial
non-zero current yields a non-zero time derivative of the radial electric ﬁeld,
i.e. a non-zero time derivative of the poloidal velocity. The plasma would be
accelerated without limit in the poloidal direction, but the torque competes with

1

the magnetic pumping, a very eﬀective damping mechanism. We draw attention
to the oscillatory variation of the velocity, which occurs an a scale much faster
than the dissipative decay.

Such “events”, consisting of sudden creation of non-ambipolar ﬂuxes, fol-
lowed by a fast plasma response in view of reinstoring the ambipolarity, can
appear in a random space and time sequence and on the average can aﬀect
the plasma dynamics. To look in detail to only one event we shall adopt an
“initial value” point of view. We consider the slab geometry with x the radial
coordinate increasing from the reference point toward the centre of plasma, y
the poloidal coordinate, z is directed along the shearless magnetic ﬁeld such as
the mixed product of the three versors is positive. The radial electric current is
switched on at t = 0 , jx (t = 0) = −enve
x (we note e ≡ |e|) and for simplicity we
shall assume that ve
x is constant in time and uniform in space during this single
event. From the momentum conservation we ﬁnd (with c and vA respectively
the light speed and the Alfven speed),

We have neglected the damping and the diamagnetic ﬂow. From the initial
non-ambipolar current (−enve
x = jx (0) 6= 0) it results a time-growing poloidal
velocity whose magnitude is inverse proportional to the very large factor repre-
senting the plasma transversal permitivity ε⊥ = 1 + c2/v2
A.

Since the time-derivative of the poloidal velocity is constant, the plasma
rotates indeﬁnitely in the poloidal direction with higher and higher velocity.
Naturally this requires the consideration of saturation mechanisms and makes
desirable a time-depending investigation. We write in more detail the ion mo-
mentum equations on x and y

This equation contains higher time and space (x) derivatives. In order to
simplify the problem we assume that the externally imposed electron ﬂux is
uniform on the radial direction (for the region of interest) and this renders the
entire model invariant to translation in x coordinate. Then we shall restrict
this discussion to solutions which are independent of x. We shall neglect the
problem of the stability of the uniform solutions at perturbations in x. Then
we have

The initial order i-derivatives of the velocity are noted vi, i = 0, 1, 2. They
are taken to reﬂect the sudden onset of the electron ﬂux, i.e. the initial poloidal
velocity is zero, v0 ≡ vi
y (t = 0) = 0 and the ﬁrst derivative is obtained from the
assumption that at t = 0 the ions did not yet moved radially (vi
x = 0) which

The second derivative is taken zero, v2 = 0. The asymptotic value of the poloidal
velocity is insensitive to this parameter.

1 Discussion

The most interesting aspect of this solution is the oscillatory behaviour which
is strongly controlled by the non-dissipative part of the equation (i.e. terms not
depending on ν). The dynamic is very clear: just at t = 0 the ions acquire a
high time derivative of their poloidal velocity, imposed by jx (t = 0) = −enve
x.
The velocity vi
y starts from zero and grows very fast to values which can be
higher than those required to cancel the non-ambipolar current jx. Then they
reverse the current and since the electrons are constrained to follow the external
drive (magnetic radial perturbation), the tendency of rotation reverses and so
on. The decay due to the magnetic pumping appears on longer time scales and
this indeed reduces the plasma rotation, without completely eliminating the
oscillations. A plot, Fig. (1) of this evolution is shown, on very large time scale
(useful to see the atenuation).

The asymptotic value of the poloidal velocity is (with our choices of initial

conditions)

We can see that the nature of these oscillations is similar to that caused by a
deviation form electric neutrality, when the frequency is the plasma frequency
. The important eﬀect of the of these oscillation is in the
ωp =
energy balance. The plasma rotation takes energy from the source of the initial

magnetic perturbation and from the electron kinetic energy, since both support
the radial electron current. This energy is dissipated via the collisional ion
viscosity represented by the magnetic dumping. A more complex treatment of
this problem should include a detailed electron dynamics, under the eﬀect of
the external magnetic perturbation (which must be quantiﬁed). However, the
presence of an oscillatory behaviour is still expected and suggests to take this
into account when the eﬃciency of magnetic stochasticity-induced transport is
considered.

Abstract

A kinetic equation which combines the quasiparticle drift of Landau’s equation
with a dissipation governed by a nonlocal and noninstant scattering integral in the
spirit of Snider’s equation for gases is derived. Consequent balance equations for the
density, momentum and energy include quasiparticle contributions and the second
order quantum virial corrections and are proven to be consistent with conservation
laws.

The very basic idea of the Boltzmann equation (BE), to balance the drift
of particles with dissipation, is used both in gases, plasmas and condensed
systems like metals or nuclei. In both ﬁelds, the BE allows for a number of
improvements which make it possible to describe phenomena far beyond the
range of validity of the original BE. In these improvements the theory of gases
diﬀers from theory of condensed systems. In theory of gases, the focus was on
so called virial corrections that take into account a ﬁnite volume of molecules,
e.g. Enskog included space non-locality of binary collisions [1]. In the theory of
condensed systems, modiﬁcations of the BE are determined by the quantum
mechanical statistics. A headway in this ﬁeld is covered by the Landau concept
of quasiparticles [2]. There are three major modiﬁcations: the Pauli blocking
of scattering channels; underlying quantum mechanical dynamics of collisions;
and quasiparticle renormalization of a single-particle-like dispersion relation.
However, the scattering integral of the BE remains local in space and time.
In other words, the Landau theory does not include a quantum mechanical
analogy of virial corrections. The missing link of two major streams in trans-
port theory is clearly formulated by Lalo¨e and Mullin [3] in their comments on
Snider’s equation. Our aim is to ﬁll this gap. Brieﬂy, here we derive a transport
equation that includes quasiparticle renormalizations in the standard form of
Landau’s theory and virial corrections in the form similar to the theory of
gases. “Particle diameters” and other non-localities of the scattering integral
are given in form of derivatives of phase shift in binary collisions [4,5].

Here, quasiparticle distribution f , quasiparticle energy ε and wave-function
renormalization z are functions of time t, coordinate r, momentum k and
isospin a. The self-energy Σ>,< is moreover a function of energy ω, however
it enters the transport equation only by its value at pole ω = ε. The drift
terms in the l.h.s of (1) have the standard form of the BE except that the
single-particle-like energy ε is renormalized. This is exactly the form of drift
visualized by Landau. The scattering integral in the r.h.s. of (1) is, however,
more general than expected by Landau, in particular, it includes virial cor-
rections which emerge for complex self-energies [6]. The self-energy we discuss
is constructed from a two-particle T-matrix in the Bethe-Goldstone approx-
imation (for simplicity, we have left aside the exchange term) Σ<(1, 2) =
T R(1, ¯3; ¯5, ¯6)T A(¯7, ¯8; 2, ¯4)G>(¯4, ¯3)G<(¯5, ¯7)G<(¯6, ¯8), which is known to include
non-trivial virial corrections [7]. Here, G’s are single-particle Green’s func-
tions, numbers are cumulative variables, 1 ≡ (t, r, a), time, coordinate and
isospin. Bars denote internal variables that are integrated over. The self-
energy as a functional of Green’s functions Σ[G] is converted into the scat-
tering integral Σε[f ] via the quasiparticle approximation G>(ω, k, r, t, a) =
(1 − f (k, r, t, a))2πδ(ω − ε(k, r, t, a)) and G<(ω, k, r, t, a) = f (k, r, t, a)2πδ(ω −
ε(k, r, t, a)). Omitting gradient contributions to collisions one simpliﬁes the
scattering integral, but on cost of virial corrections. Indeed, the space and
time non-locality of the scattering integral is washed out in absence of gradi-
ents. To obtain the scattering integral with virial corrections we linearize all
functions in a vicinity of (r, t) using ri − r and t1 − t as small parameters to
second order. Then the scattering integral of equation (1) results

4(∆2 + ∆3 + ∆4). After derivatives, ∆’s are evaluated at the energy
shell Ω → ε1 + ε2 The ∆’s are eﬀective shifts and they represent mean val-
ues of various non-localities of the scattering integral. These shifts enter the
scattering integral in form known from theory of gases [1], however, the set of
shifts is larger than the one intuitively expected. The full set (3) is necessary
to guarantee gauge invariance. One can see that sending all ∆’s to zero, the
scattering integral (2) simpliﬁes to the one used in the BE for quasiparticles.
The scattering integral is interpreted as collision at time t and coordinate r
in which two particles (holes) a and b of momenta k and p scatter into ﬁnal
states of momenta k − q and p + q. This interpretation is correct for the weak-
coupling limit T R ≈ V , where the phase shift in dissipative channels vanishes,
φ = 0, and no virial corrections appear. With nontrivial ∆’s, the interpretation
has to be slightly modiﬁed due to ﬁnite collision duration and ﬁnite “particle
diameters”. For instant potential, the particles a and b enter the collision at
the same time instant (there is no time shift between arguments υ0
a and υ3
b )
a and υ2
and leave the collision together (there is no time shift between υ1
b ).
The only time shift ∆t is between the beginning and the end of collision. This
time shift is just the collision delay discussed by Danielewicz and Pratt [8].
Due to the ﬁnite duration of the collision, the pair of particles a and b can
gain an energy 2∆ω from external ﬁelds. The momentum shift 2∆k describes
an acceleration the pair of particles picks up during their correlated motion.

With respect to a general form of the transport equation we have already
fulﬁlled our task: the quasiparticle transport equation (1) with the non-local
scattering integral (2) is our ﬁnal result. This transport equation has compli-
cated self-consistent structure: (i) quasiparticle energy depends on distribu-
tions via real part of self-energy, (ii) scattering rate depends on distributions
via Pauli blocking of two-particle propagation in T-matrix, (iii) ∆’s depend
on distributions also due to Pauli blocking. The same complexity one meets
for the quasiparticle BE, except for neglected ∆’s. In fact, ∆’s do not rep-
resent much of additional work as the T-matrix has to be evaluated within
the BE anyway. To summarize, we have derived a Boltzmann-like transport

equation for quasiparticles that includes virial corrections to the scattering
integral via set of shifts in time, space, momentum and energy. We have been
able to proof conservation laws for density, momentum and energy [9,10]. The
presented theory extends the theory of quantum gases [11,12] and non-ideal
plasma [13] to degenerated system.

With respect to numerical implementations the presented theory is as simple
as possible: the scattering integral (2) includes only six-dimensional integra-
tion as the standard BE, the virial corrections in form of ∆’s are friendly
to simulation Monte Carlo methods. Numerical tractability of the presented
transport equation documents Ref. [14], where space shifts estimated from
ground state have been used.

Within the traditional frame of reduced MHD, a new rigorous perturbation expansion provides the
equation ruling the nonlinear growth and saturation of the tearing mode for any current gradient.
The small parameter is the magnetic island width w. For the ﬁrst time, the ﬁnal equation displays
at once terms of order w ln(1/w) and w which have the same magnitude for practical purposes; two
new O(w) terms involve the current gradient. The technique is applicable to the case of an external
forcing. The solution for a static forcing is computed explicitly and it exhibits three physical regimes.

Many out of equilibrium macroscopic media display bi-
furcations leading to the build up of macroscopic struc-
tures. In magnetized plasmas, magnetic islands are such
structures. They can develop in the presence of a cur-
rent inhomogeneity through the instability of the tearing
mode [1] which produces magnetic reconnection. This
mode corresponds to a global magnetic perturbation that
is resonant in a spatial region where its wave-number is
perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic is-
land occurs in this region and stretches along the wave-
number direction. The nonlinear saturation of a tear-
ing magnetic island is the simplest instance of magnetic
self-organization in a plasma. Tokamak operation avoids
the formation of such islands, since they degrade conﬁne-
ment. In the reversed-ﬁeld pinch (RFP), the occurrence
of several magnetic islands leads to magnetic chaos spoil-
ing conﬁnement, but the formation of a single magnetic
island is desirable, since it should provide good magnetic
ﬂux surfaces and a laminar dynamo. Therefore, a correct
description and understanding of the nonlinear tearing
mode is both important for thermonuclear fusion and for
advancing the theory of plasma self-organization.

The nonlinear tearing mode is classically described
by applying resistive reduced magnetohydrodynamics
(RRMHD) to the model of a static plasma slab, in the
limit of small dissipation [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The magnetic
island region is considered as a boundary layer whose
nonlinear features are dealt with, while the outer region
is adequately described by linear theory only. The in-
ner and outer solutions are then matched asymptotically.
Rutherford [2] showed that the Navier-Stokes equation
of RRMHD reduces in the nonlinear regime to a mere
Grad-Shafranov equation, and proved a linear growth of
the island width w to follow the exponential growth of
the linear regime. The island saturation was dealt with
approximately in Refs. [3], and rigorously in Ref. [4], for
a large enough current gradient in the island region, and
in Refs. [5, 6] for a vanishing gradient.

important novelties both in the method and in the ﬁnal
results. A new rigorous perturbation expansion using the
magnetic island width w as a small parameter is applied
in the inner region where no assumption is made on the
current gradient. This technique is in principle workable
at any order, and is applicable to the case of an external
forcing in a plasma with a velocity proﬁle. The explicit
solution is provided and discussed for the case of static
forcing. Both uniform and non uniform electric ﬁeld pro-
ﬁles are considered. The ﬁnal equation describing the
nonlinear island growth and saturation displays together
the known term of order w ln(1/w) [4] as well as a known
[5, 6] and two new terms of order w. Both orders have
the same importance for physical applications, and the
ﬁrst neglected term involves a factor w2, which makes it
physically smaller. Furthermore, the asymptotic match-
ing reveals a jump of magnetic ﬂux in the inner domain.
We use the 2D RRMHD equations in the (x, y) plane

nant surface

that the vorticity and the viscosity terms in Eq. 1 are
proportional to η2 and ην respectively. These two terms
can then be dropped by assuming the island width to be
larger than the visco-resistive and resistive lengths [2].

where ∆′, the usual tearing mode stability index, is the
jump of the logarithmic derivative of ψout1 at x = 0, and
Σ′ is the sum of the right and left values of this derivative.
We now proceed to the nonlinear description of the
inner region. Since the saturated mode amplitude corre-
sponds to a bifurcation ruled by the stability index ∆′,
our analysis will show that δ depends on ∆′. First, we
need to deﬁne a suitable ordering of the ﬁelds. Since we
are interested in tearing modes in the small island limit,
it is appropriate to use the so-called constant-ψ approx-
imation [1]. Denoting by ˜ψ the perturbed ﬂux function
and by ˜ψ′ its x-derivative, we assume that ˜ψ varies little
in the island region, δ ˜ψ′/ ˜ψ << 1. Since the perturbed
current is at most of order ˜ψ′/δ and ˜ψ itself is of order δ2,
one concludes that J = 1 to leading order in the island

region. Physically, this means that a tearing mode island
does not alter appreciably the equilibrium current. At ze-
roth order in δ, Eq. 5 shows that ζ0, the leading order
of ζ, satisﬁes ∂2
cos χ
upon matching with (6). Moreover, Eq. 4 shows that ϕ
is at most of order 1. We thus rewrite Eqs. 3-5, for both
models, in terms of ˜ζ

variables (ξ, χ)

where the Poisson brackets are now taken with respect
to (ξ, χ). A few remarks are now in order. First, we note
that whereas Eqs. 7-9 can be solved in powers of δ, log-
arithmic contributions of the form δn(ln δ)m eventually
appear due to the matching requirement with the outer
solution (6). Furthermore, inspection of the structure of
the equations shows that the exponent in ln δ is bounded
by the exponent in δ: m
n. We therefore make the

Finally, we note that the structure of the lowest order
linear operator occurring in Eqs. 7-9, [ζ0, A], makes it
convenient to write the equations in terms of the new pair
of independent variables (ζ0, χ). The Poisson bracket is
then changed from [A, B] into ξ[A, B], where [A, B] is
now deﬁned in terms of (ζ0, χ) and ξ is meant as a double-
[2(ζ0 +cos χ)]1/2. All the
valued function of (ζ0, χ), ξ =
equations from now on are understood in terms of these
new variables. ζ0 identiﬁes magnetic ﬂux surfaces to the
lowest signiﬁcant order in the perturbation expansion. In
particular, ζ0 = 1 corresponds to the separatrix. In the
following, we will make systematic use, for any function
∂χA dχ = 0 where Cζ0 identiﬁes a
A, of the identity
(lowest order) ﬂux surface. The term by term derivation
of the various contributions to the series 10-12, up to
O(δ2), is now outlined.

side was already derived in [2], the second one in [4], and
the b2w term in [5, 6]. If b1 = 0, this formula predicts a
saturation only for b2 < 0. In the opposite case, there is
no saturation with a small island. Furthermore, we notice
that the Σ′ parameter enters this equation, which means
that the contribution of order δ may be important even
for a small b2 if Σ′ is large enough. Furthermore b1Σ′
may be positive, and thus destabilizing.

Equation 26 was obtained by matching the ﬁrst Fourier
harmonic in χ. Matching the zeroth order harmonic
at the same orders in δ brings in interesting physics
too. At order δ, the matching to Eq. 6 is possible
but for a residual contribution of the form
Ω, where
2b1√2/3. This is no problem,
Ω
since one still has the freedom to add constant contri-
butions to the ﬂux function (6) that can be diﬀerent in
each side of the outer region. Physically, this means that
the development of a magnetic island produces a change
of total magnetic ﬂux of magnitude 2δ3Ω. At order δ2,
the zeroth Fourier harmonic of ∂ξζ2 is
In or-
der for this term to be matched, we must include a new
λδ4b1Ωξ, which is al-
contribution to (6) of the form

the additional physical constraint of total current con-
servation. In cylindrical geometry, the jump of magnetic
ﬂux corresponds to a ﬂux production in the central part
of the plasma by the nonlinear tearing mode. This ef-
fect was observed in a RFP [7], and contributes to the
toroidal ﬁeld reversal, because of the global toroidal ﬂux
conservation [8].

In the presence of a static forcing, one has to add a
solution of the inhomogeneous problem, which is conve-
niently chosen in a unique way by setting it to zero at
x = 0 [9]. Assuming that forcing is applied at the large-x
boundary, this solution has the form ψ1f (x, y) = 0 for
x < 0 and ψ1f (x, y) = Af f (x) cos ky for x > 0, where
f (x) is the solution of the linear ideal MHD equation
that satisﬁes f (0) = 0, f ′(0) = 1, and Af is a parameter
uniquely determined by the forced boundary conditions
which can be taken positive in full generality.
In the
matching region, the complete solution is the sum of the
unforced solution (6) and of the forced solution ψf , where

Moreover, a phase diﬀerence φ between the forced and
the unforced solutions can be taken into account by sub-
stituting cos χ with cos (χ + φ) in (6). Matching is then
done separately on the cos χ and sin χ components. The
outcome is a set of coupled evolution equations for the is-
land width and for the phase. One ﬁnds that ﬁxed points
occur for φ = 0 and φ = π. For φ = 0, there is only one
ﬁxed point which is stable and whose island width is given
by the steady state solution of (26) with the substitution

a saddle point, unstable in the direction of the phase.
Therefore, the island chain position always adjusts to be

Equation 26 has been cross-checked in two diﬀerent
ways. The analytical results have been obtained inde-
pendently by two variants [10, 11] of Thyagaraja’s tech-

4

nique [4]. The numerical coeﬃcients have been computed
independently in [11].

As a conclusion, we have tackled the problem of non-
linear tearing mode saturation by using a new rigorous
perturbation expansion. Equation 26 brings for the ﬁrst
time the correct expression up to terms of order w2 for
the island width evolution. A magnetic ﬂux jump cor-
responding to a solenoidal eﬀect in cylindrical geometry
has been exhibited. The problem of the static forcing of a
static plasma has been solved and displays three physical
regimes. Preliminary calculations indicate that our per-
turbation technique works also in the case of a velocity
proﬁle in the plasma, and of a forcing rotating at a possi-
bly diﬀerent speed than the resonant plasma region. Our
approach can also easily be adapted to the case of cylin-
drical geometry and this will be presented elsewhere. It is
important to appreciate that establishing solid analytic
techniques to solve the classic nonlinear tearing prob-
lem opens up new routes to deal with problems whose
modeling goes beyond conventional RRMHD. In partic-
ular, it would be interesting to revisit neoclassical and
two-ﬂuid diamagnetic eﬀects on the generalized Ruther-
ford equation. Last but not least, our approach was not
based on the speciﬁc J = J(ψ) property but rather on a
straightforward perturbation expansion, and may there-
fore be applicable to more complex physical models in
which [ψ, J]

= 0, which will be done elsewhere.

We acknowledge fruitful discussions with J. Hastie, F.
Militello and F. Porcelli which led to a joint oral contri-
bution at the last IAEA meeting [12].

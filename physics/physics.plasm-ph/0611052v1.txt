described and the link between ﬁeld reversal and the discharge structure is analyzed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The phenomena of ﬁeld reversal of the axial electric
ﬁeld in the negative glow of a dc discharge has been dis-
cussed since a long time in literature [1, 2]. In a founding
paper Druvestyn and Penning [3] hypothesized its exis-
tence. Lawler et al.
[4] assumed its existence when evalu-
ating the current balance at the surface of a cold cathode
discharge and estimated the position of the ﬁeld reversal
by linearly extrapolating the optical data of atomic tran-
sitions. The determination of the position where the ﬁeld
reversal occurs is of great importance since the fraction
of ions returning to the cathode depends on its existence
and location, and it is necessary for correctly determine
the conditions for a self-sustained discharge.

Kolobov and Tsendin [5] have shown that the ﬁrst
ﬁeld reversal is located near the end of the negative glow
(NG), near the position (although located slightly to the
cathode side) where ions density attains its greatest mag-
nitude [6]. If the discharge length has enough extension
and the pressure decrease to lower values it appears a sec-
ond ﬁeld reversal on the boundary between the Faraday
dark space and the positive column (PC) [5, 6].

Moreover, Kolobov and Tsendin explained how ions
produced to the left of the ﬁrst reversal location move
to the cathode by ambipolar diﬀusion - helping to main-
tain the glow by secondary electron emission - and ions
generated to the right of this location drift to the anode.
More recent work [7, 8] presenting a comparison of
experimental data and the predictions of a hybrid ﬂuid-
Monte Carlo model also supports the view that the point
where the ﬁeld is extrapolated to zero is practically co-
incident with the maximum of the emission (even when
j/p2 scaling is no longer valid). Those characteristics
were experimentally observed by laser optogalvanic spec-
troscopy [6]. For a detailed review see also [9].

Boeuf and Pitchford [10] with a simple ﬂuid model
gave an analytical expression of the ﬁeld reversal loca-
tion showing its dependency solely on the cathode sheath
length, the gap length, and the ionization relaxation

length. They obtained as well the fraction of ions ar-
riving at the cathode and the magnitude of the plasma
maximum density.

Technological application of gas discharges, particu-
larly to plasma display panels, needs a better knowledge
of the processes involved.

II. STRUCTURE OF A GLOW DISCHARGE

The phenomenology of DC glow discharges are well
described, for example, by Roth [11], where the existence
of the ﬁeld reversal in the negative glow (NG) is already
clearly shown. To be complete, we will recall now the
most signiﬁcant features with interest to our problem.
In the regime of a normal glow discharge the voltage and
the current density are both practically independent of
the total current ﬂowing in the discharge tube.

In a crude picture, energy is continuously transferred
from a high voltage DC power source to the electrons
originating from the cathode that accelerate absorbing
energy from the ﬁeld eE, ionizing, exciting and undergo-
ing elastic collisions with heavy particles and other elec-
trons. Electrons disappear basically by recombination
and diﬀusion to the walls. Secondary electrons from the
cathode provides an additional source of electrons and
they have a prominent role in the discharge maintenance.
The electric ﬁeld decreases in the sheath, vary slowly in
the plasma and increases again in the anode sheath, al-
though not attaining such high value as in the cathode.
All plasmas are separated from the walls (both conduct-
ing or non-conducting) by a sheath. The higher ener-
gies are attained by electrons which bombard far more
frequently the walls than ions. The slower ions remain-
ing behind build-up a positive plasma potential relative
to the wall with a magnitude of the order of the elec-
tron kinetic temperature. In consequence ions are eas-
ily drawn oﬀ through the sheath by an external circuit
as a current I while electrons are repelled by the walls
(and electrodes), only escaping the most energetic ones.
As we proceed from the cathode to the anode we recog-
nize several regions, ﬁrst observed by Michael Faraday in
the 1830’s, with interest to the present study (see also
Refs. [11, 12]):

• Aston dark space - The electric ﬁeld is very high
and primary and secondary electrons outnumber
ions. However, electrons have not still attained

enough energy to excite neutrals and they have low
density making this region to appear dark;

• cathode glow - electrons have already enough en-
ergy to excite neutrals and ions density increases;

• cathode (Crookes, Hittorf) dark space - Electrons
are either too fast or too slow to excite the gas.
The probability for fast electrons to excite are not
negligible, however, and that’s why this regions is
slightly brighter than the Aston dark space.
In
this region electrons have enough energy to ionize
the gas and the ions production rate attains high
magnitude, the dominant charge being positive. It
is in this region that the primary electrons loose
a great fraction of its energy in ionizing collisions
and the generated secondary electrons appear with
lower energy. Slow electrons are produced in this
region. A moderate electric ﬁeld dominates;

• cathode region (CR) - This is a transition region
between the cathode dark space and the negative
glow where most of the voltage drop (cathode fall)
of φc at x = dc. The axial length of the cathode
region dc adjust its value in order to maintain a
minimum value of the product dcp, the Paschen
minimum;

• negative glow (NG) - The electric ﬁeld is here very
low, but its luminosity results from the electrons
that have been accelerated in the CR and ionize
and excite neutrals in the NG (that’s why the lu-
minosity is more intense on the CR side). As elec-
trons lose their energy, recombinations processes
are more probable, mainly in poliatomic electroneg-
ative gases to which electrons attach more easily.
Electrons carry almost all the entire electric cur-
rent in this region. Ionization in the glow can con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the total ion current in the
glow due to backscattered ions from the NG enter-
ing the cathode fall [13].

• Faraday dark space (FDS) - This region is located
immediately to the right of the NG. Electrons en-
ergy is low and their density decreases due to re-
combination and radial diﬀusion. However, in gas
discharge tubes with a radius much smaller than
the discharge length, the electric ﬁeld start to grow
again and electrons gain energy giving birth to the
positive column.

III. EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATION OF
FIELD REVERSAL

The phenomenon of ﬁeld reversal was experimen-
tally observed by laser optogalvanic spectroscopy (LOG)
ﬁrstly by Gottscho et al. [6]. The LOG technique used
was reported by Walkup et al. [14] and is based on a
change of ion mobility on excitation by a dye laser. This

2

means that an excited ion state with a larger (smaller)
mobility will
induce a transient current increase (de-
crease) on excitation. The sign of the LOG signal de-
pends only on the sign of electric ﬁeld reversal. Gottscho
et al. [6] at the same time recorded the N +
g ) ions
excited from its lowest and ﬁrst excited vibrational levels
u − X 2Σ:g+ (0,0) and (0,1) bands, re-
(exciting the B2Σ+
spectively) using laser-induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) along
the plane parallel electrodes of their reactor. They noted
that at low pressure the LOG signal changes sign near
the position of the N +
2 maximum while being located
slightly to the cathode side. At higher pressure the ﬁeld
reversal occurs toward the anode side of the N +
2 density
maximum.

2 (X 2Σ+

The LOG and LIF spatial proﬁles resulting from the
u − X 2Σ:g+ (0,0) and (0,1) bands
excitation of the B2Σ+
decrease ﬁrst strongly to negative values due to the falloﬀ
in ion density, as it is registered by LIF. This is the pre-
sheath [11], a quasi-neutral region between the plasma
and the sheath characterized by small electric ﬁelds gra-
dients (usually smaller than 1 V/cm). At a given posi-
tion ions practically remain undetected by LIF, the LOG
signal diminishes rapidly and this is a signature of the
beginning of the cathode fall region.

IV. PHYSICAL MECHANISM OF THE
ELECTRIC FIELD REVERSALS IN GLOW
DISCHARGES

Electric ﬁeld reversals operate as a self-regulator mech-
anism of glow discharges. If electrons were in hydrody-
namic equilibrium with the local electric ﬁeld and were
created in the cathode sheath followed by a fast diﬀu-
sion to the walls and acceleration to the anode, then ions
loss would occur through migration to the cathode and it
will be no need for ﬁeld reversal. This situation would be
similar if the ionization main channels were ion and fast
neutral impact ionization instead of electron impact ion-
ization. However, electrons are not in equilibrium with
the local electric ﬁeld. This situation results from the
complex structure embodied in the sheath, pre-sheath
and plasma regions (see Ref. [11] for details). The electric
ﬁeld decreases largely from the cathode surface within an
adjacent region where the charged-particle density is low
[15]). In this region electrons gain energy being
(e.g.,
strongly accelerated toward the bulk plasma attaining
typically kinetic energies in the range 10 ÷ 103 eV. Thus,
they are responsible of the excitation and ionization pro-
cesses in the quasi-neutral region we call plasma. Clearly
their energy is determined by the electron-energy spec-
trum and not by the local value of the electric ﬁeld [16].
Under typical gas discharge conditions it is possible to
consider two groups of electrons: the group of slow and
fast electrons. The majority of them belongs to the slow
group of electrons; they are created in the quasi-neutral
(bulk) plasma region through ionization and their kinetic
energy does not exceed signiﬁcantly the energy of the ﬁrst

excitation level ǫ1 [17]. The low electric ﬁeld prevalent
in the quasi-neutral region with a vast majority of slow
electrons (with energies in the range 10−2 ÷ 10 eV) is
favorable to increase electrons loss while at the same time
reducing ions loss. But as the total current density

j = je + ji = −eneve + enivi

(1)

must be constant along the discharge a mechanism of
ﬁeld reversal appears in order to enhance ions loss and
reduce slow electrons loss. At the position where ﬁeld
reversal takes place the plasma potential presents a min-
imum value [6]. This situation creates a kind of two con-
tiguous reservoirs: to the left of the ﬁeld reversal, ions
generated by fast electrons ﬂow to the cathode, where
hitting the electrode surface induce secondary electrons
emission at the cathode (and thus helping maintaining
the glow); to the right of the ﬁeld reversal, ions are ac-
celerated toward the anode. As electrons diﬀuse more
rapidly to the walls than ions, the walls along the posi-
tive column and near the anode sheath charge negatively,
while along the cathode fall they charge positively (see,
for example, Ref.
[12]). This charge build-up deform the
equipotentials surfaces that, instead to remain parallel to
the electrodes, show the concave side facing the anode.

V. KOLOBOV AND TSENDIN NONLOCAL
KINETIC MODEL

Due to the complex self-consistent problem that is at
stake, Kolobov and Tsendin endeavored to develop an
analytical approach with a formidable complexity. Since
the papers of Emeleus and co-workers [18, 19] electrons
have been divided in primary, secondary (or interme-
diate) and ultimate (or trapped) and so did Kolobov
and Tsendin. The highly energetic electron created in
the cathode sheath of a DC discharge have kinetic en-
ergies well above the ﬁrst excitation potential ε∗. Ion-
ization and excitation processes are created by them and
they carry the electron current in the sheath and nearby
plasma region. The plasma region is mainly populated
by trapped electrons that do not contribute to the cur-
rent. In the NG and FDS the current is mainly carried
by (untrapped) intermediate electrons with energies be-
low ε∗. The discharge gap is divided in two regions: the
sheath and the (quasi-neutral) plasma region.

The fast electrons are described by a continuous-

energy-loss model neglecting scattering

= −N L(w) − eE(x),

(2)

where w is the electron kinetic energy, N is the neutral
particle density, L(w) is the energy-loss function, ξ is the
fast-electron path along its trajectory and x is the spatial
coordinate.

Neglecting scattering, then ξ = x and the kinetic equa-

Here, J(x, v) is a source term and it was assumed L(w) =
L0 = const.
Its integration is performed at constant
energy

ε = w + N L0x − eφ(x) = w − e ˜φ(x),

(4)

where φ(x) is the electrostatic potential obtained for
linear-electric ﬁeld proﬁle in the sheath. The fast elec-
trons start riding on an eﬀective potential, e ˜φ(x), that
attains a minimum in a point where the total force is
zero, eE( ˜d) = N L0 (see Fig.2). For example, for He,
L0 = 1.5 × 10−15 eV cm2. Solving Eq. 3 it is obtained
the fast-electron current

(cid:26)

(5)

where α = N L0/ε0, with ε0 denoting the constant energy
loss per ion-electron pair and Γe is the electron ﬂux from
the cathode. Notice that for x < ˜d the total electron
current je is equal to the fast-electron current jf and
that, in particular, we have

dje
dx

= αjf = I(x).

(6)

Here, I(x) is the ionization density. Eqs. 5 and 6 con-
stitute a generalization of the Townsend approach with
a constant ionization coeﬃcient α = const.

At x > x1(e ˜φc) there is no ionization source since the
fast electrons do not reach this region; this region limits
the boundary between the FDS and NG (see Sec. 2 for
its characterization) and the length of the NG is given
qualitatively by R = eφc/αε0.

For slow electrons with w < ε∗ the continuous-energy-
loss is no longer valid and it is essential to take into ac-
count the essential discrete character of the energy loss,
where elastic and electron-electron collisions are the only
energy-relaxation mechanisms.
If L is bigger than the
electron mean free path λ, then the electron energy distri-
bution function (EDF) is isotropic and the two-term ex-
pansion in spherical harmonics holds. Hence, taking into
account the following contributions:
i) degradation of
fast electrons injected into the plasma from the cathode
sheath; ii) slow electrons generation by fast electrons; iii)
slow electrons superelastic collisions with molecular low
vibrational levels or others, with kinetic energy slightly
exceeding ε∗, the kinetic equation for the isotropic part
of the EDF gives for the trapped electrons a Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution of the type:

imum trapped electron density at the point of ﬁeld re-
versal E(x) = 0. The electron temperature is obtained
by solving the integral energy balance for trapped elec-
trons, but in a ﬁrst approach we have eφa ∼ Te. For
example, by laser diagnostics experiments [15] the slow
electron temperature and density are Te = 0.2 eV and
nm = 1.2 × 1012 cm3in He at p = 3.5 Torr, with an
electrode gap L = 0.62 cm and j = 0.846 mA/ cm2.

The js is the the total electron current in the FDS rep-

are expected to be isothermal and to be governed by the
ambipolar diﬀusion equation:

Here, τ = Λ2/Da. Eq. 10 can be solved using the Green’s
function approach with appropriate boundary conditions.
It gives the minimum xm:

(11)

The position of xm determines the ratio of ions return-
ing to the cathode. If the FDS length (L − R) exceeds
(R − d) then xm → R and the majority of ions gen-
erated in the plasma return to the cathode; if, on the
contrary, R − d > L − R this means that fast electrons
penetrate deep in the plasma, the majority of them at-
taining the anode.
In their calculation the position of
maximum ions density coincides with the ﬁeld reversal
location. Unfortunately, Kolobov and Tsendin do not
give explicit expression for xm, introducing an error in
Eq. 11 (see remark in Ref. [20]).

To resume the previous work by Kolobov and
Tsendin [5], the study of nonlocal phenomena in electron
kinetics of collisional gas discharge plasma have shown
that in the presence of ﬁeld reversals the bulk electrons in
the cathode plasma are clearly separated in two groups of
slow electrons: trapped and free electrons. Trapped elec-
trons give no contribution to the current but represent
the majority of the electron population. The ﬁrst ﬁeld
reversal it was shown qualitatively to be located near the
end of the negative glow (NG) where the plasma density
attains the greatest magnitude. If the discharge length
is long enough, it appears a second ﬁeld reversal on the
boundary between the Faraday dark space and the pos-
itive column. Also, it was shown that ions produced to
the left of this ﬁrst reversal location move to the cathode
by ambipolar diﬀusion and ions generated to the right of
this location drift to the anode. For a review see also [9].

VI. BOEUF AND PITCHFORD FLUID MODEL

Boeuf et al [10] with a simple ﬂuid model gave an an-
alytical expression of the ﬁeld reversal location which
showed to depend solely on the cathode sheath length,
the gap length, and the ionization relaxation length.
They obtained as well a simple analytical expression giv-
ing the fraction of ions returning to the cathode and the
magnitude of the plasma maximum density.

Their model assumes a spatial proﬁle of the ioniza-
tion rate ST (x) = Ne(x)νi(x) in a plasma being formed
in a parallel plate geometry. Monte Carlo calculations
show that the ionization rate is linear in the sheath and
decreases exponentially in the NG [21] and so they as-
sumed

Here, λε is the energy relaxation length of the high elec-

while s is a function of the voltage φc, gas mixture and

is proportional to the ﬂux of secondary electrons leaving
the cathode Γe0 (here, e (electrons) and i (ions) denotes
the specie). They assume that slow electrons can be de-
scribed by a continuity equation and a momentum trans-
port equation in the drift-diﬀusion approximation (and
thus considering drift energy negligible with respect to
thermal energy):

At some position xm it can possibly occur a ﬁeld rever-
sal, located at a boundary that split the ion ﬂux at the
right side toward the anode and keeping electrons con-
ﬁned in the plasma region while at the left side directing
the ion ﬂux toward the cathode. Hence, a condition can
be stated of a total current at some yet unspeciﬁed po-
sition x0 (in this Sec. we use this notation for the ﬁeld
reversal location) being equal to the electron current:

The above equation shows that, by one side, the position
of the ﬁeld reversal x0 depends on the cathode sheath
length dc, the gap length L and on the electron energy
relaxation length λε. By other side, dc and λε depend on
the cathode sheath voltage and gas mixture. As can be
seen in Fig. 2, when λε ≪ L (low values of Λ) the position
of the ﬁeld reversal is near the plasma-sheath boundary;
when λε ≫ L (large values of Λ) the position of the
ﬁeld reversal is displaced to the mid-distance between
the gap length and the plasma-sheath boundary. This
last case occurs for an obstructed discharge, i.e, when
the gap length is less than the Paschen minimum dc at
the Paschen minimum.

(26)

This fraction depends only on Λ and, as Fig. 3 illustrate,
its values are between 0.5 and 1.

Fig. 3 shows that when the electron energy relaxation
length λε is smaller than the gap length, η → 1, the ma-
jor fraction of ions return to the cathode. This is true if
radial diﬀusion to the walls or recombination is not ac-
counted for. In the condition of an obstructed discharge
λε ≫ L, then η → 0.5. Taking into account radial dif-
fusion and recombination will lower the fraction of ions
returning to the cathode.

Integrating Eq. 22 between x = dc and a given x,
considering appropriate boundary conditions, n(dc) =

with χ = x−dc
. The plasma density attains a maximum
L−dc
at the position where occurs the ﬁeld reversal x0. This is
inconsistent with Eq. 16, however, since here it was ne-
glected the ions mobility in regard of the electrons mobil-
ity. In fact, the maximum of the plasma density is located
near the position of the ﬁeld reversal, but its maximum

6

should be located to the cathode side of the ﬁeld rever-
sal. Maric et al. [7, 8] showed a perfect agreement of the
analytical formula given in Eq. 24 with an hybrid Monte
Carlo-ﬂuid model. Kudryavtsev and Toinova [20] deter-
mined the position of the ﬁeld reversal from the position
of maximum ion density in the plasma. Their approach is
quite simple giving simple analytical formulas in a short
(without positive column) DC glow discharge making use
of the ionization rate coeﬃcients for fast electrons in the
ﬁeld.

VII. A DIELECTRIC-LIKE MODEL OF FIELD
REVERSAL

In this section we introduce a quite simple dielectric-
like model of a plasma-sheath system [22]. This approach
have been addressed by other authors [23, 24] to explain
how the electrical ﬁeld inversion occurs at the interface
between the plasma sheath and the beginning of the neg-
ative glow. The aim of this Letter is to obtain more infor-
mation about the fundamental properties related to ﬁeld
inversion phenomena in the frame of a dielectric model.
It is obtained a simple analytical dependence of the axial
location where ﬁeld reversal occurs in terms of macro-
scopic parameters. In addition, it is obtained the magni-
tude of the minimum electric ﬁeld inside the through, the
trapped well length, and the trapping time of the slow
electrons into the well. We emphasize in particular the
description of the dielectric behavior and do not contem-
plate plasma chemistry and plasma-surface interactions.
The analytical results hereby obtained could be useful
for hybrid ﬂuid-particle models (e.g., Fiala et al. [25]),
since simple criteria can be applied to accurately remove
electrons from the simulations.

On the ground of the stress-energy tensor considera-
tions it is shown the inherent instability of the ﬁeld in-
version sheath. The slow electrons distribution function
is obtained assuming the Fermi [26] mechanism respon-
sible for their acceleration from the trapping well.

Lets consider a plasma formed between two parallel-
plate electrodes due to an applied dc electric ﬁeld. We
assume a planar geometry, but extension to cylindrical
geometry is straightforward. The applied voltage is Va
and we assume the cathode fall length is l and the nega-
tive glow + eventually the positive column extends over
the length l0, such that the total length is L = l + l0. We
have

− Va = lEs + l0Ep,

(28)

where Es and Ep are, resp., the electric ﬁelds in the
sheath and NG (possibly including the positive column).
At the end of the cathode sheath it must be veriﬁed the
following boundary condition by the displacement ﬁeld D

n.(Dp − Ds) = σ.

(29)

Here, σ is the surface charge density accumulated at the
boundary surface and n is the normal to the surface. In

more explicit form,

εpEp − εsEs = σ.

(30)

Here, εs and εp are, resp., the electrical permittivity of
the sheath and the positive column. We have to solve
the following algebraic system of equations

called electric susceptibility. As the electric displacement
is the same everywhere, we have D0 = D1 = D2. Thus,
the residual (true) surface charge in between is given by

After a straightforward but lengthy algebraic operation
we obtain

case, εp = 1 −
, and εs = ε0, with ωp denoting the
plasma frequency and νen the electron-neutral collision
frequency. In fact, our assumption εs = ε0 is plainly jus-
tiﬁed, since experiments have shown the occurrence of
a signiﬁcant gas heating and a corresponding gas den-
sity reduction in the cathode fall region, mainly due to
symmetric charge exchanges processes which lead to an
eﬃcient conversion of electrical energy to heavy-particle
kinetic energy and thus to heating [15].

Two extreme cases can be considered:

i) ωp > νen,
implying εp < 0, meaning that τcoll > τplasma, i.e, non-
collisional regime prevails; ii) ωp < νen, εp > 0, and then
τcoll > τplasma, i.e, collisional regime dominates.

From the above Eqs. 32 we estimate the ﬁeld inversion

(33)

From Eq. 33 we can resume a criteria for ﬁeld rever-
sal:
it only occurs in the non-collisional regime; by the
contrary, in the collisional regime and to the extent of
validity of this simple model, no ﬁeld reversal will occur,
since the slow electrons scattering time inside the well
is higher than the the well lifetime, and collisions (in
particular, coulombian collisions) and trapping become
competitive processes. A similar condition was obtained
in [27] when studying the eﬀect of electron trapping in
ion-wave instability. Likewise, a self-consistent analytic
model [5] have shown that at at suﬃciently high pressure,
ﬁeld reversal is absent.

Due to the accumulation of slow electrons after a dis-
tance ξc = L − l0, real charges accumulated on a sur-
face separating the cathode fall region from the negative
glow. Naturally, it appears polarization charges on each
side of this surface and a double layer is created with
a surface charge −σ′
1 < 0 on the cathode side and σ′
2
on the anode side. But, σ′ = (P · n), P = ε0χeE with
ε = ε0(1 + χe), χe denoting the dimensionless quantity

Considering that σ = ε0χeE, we determine the minimum
value of the electric ﬁeld at the reversal point:

The magnitude of the minimum electric ﬁeld depends
on the length of the negative glow l0. This also means
that without NG there is no place for ﬁeld reversal, and
also the bigger the length the minor the electric ﬁeld.
The length of the negative glow can be estimated by the

We denote by new the density of trapped electrons and
by Tew their respective temperature. Altogether, nep and
Tep are, resp., the electron density and electron temper-
ature in the negative glow region.

Instability and width of the potential well

(43)

It is expected that the potential trough should have a
characteristic width of the order in between the electron
ε0kTe
nee2 ) and the mean scattering
Debye length (λDe =
length. Using Eq. 43, in a He plasma and assuming Va =
1 kV, l0 = 1 m and νen = 1.85 × 109 s−1 (with Te = 0.03

q

eV) at 1 Torr (n = 3.22 × 1016 cm−3) we estimate ∆ξ ≈
2.6×10−3 cm, while the Debye length is λDe = 2.4×10−3
cm. So, our Eq. 43 gives a good order of magnitude for
the potential width, which is expected to be in fact of
the same order of magnitude than the Debye length.

Table I present the set of parameters used to obtain
our estimations. We give in Table II the estimate of the
minimum electric ﬁeld attained inside the well. The ﬁrst
ﬁeld reversal at ξc ≈ lN G corresponds to the maximum
density new ≫ nep [10, 28]. So, the assumed values for
the ratio of electron temperatures and densities of the
trapped electrons and electrons on the NG are typical
estimates.

It can be shown that there is no ﬁnite conﬁguration
of ﬁelds and plasma that can be in equilibrium without
some external stress [29]. Consequently, this trough is
dim to be unstable and burst electrons periodically (or
in a chaotic process), releasing the trapped electrons to
the main plasma. This phenomena produces local pertur-
bation in the ionization rate and the electric ﬁeld giving
rise to ionization waves (striations). In the next section,
we will calculate the time of trapping with a simple Brow-
nian model.

From Eq. 33 we calculate the cathode fall length for
some gases. For this purpose we took He and H2 data
as reference for atomic and molecular gases, resp. The
orders of magnitude are the same, with the exception of
Ar. Due to Ramsauer eﬀect direct comparison is diﬃcult.

In Table III it is shown a comparison of the experimen-
tal cathode fall distances to the theoretical prediction, as
given by Eq. 43. Taking into account the limitations of
this model these estimates are well consistent with ex-
perimental data [30].

B. Lifetime of a slow electron in the potential well

The trapped electrons most probably diﬀuse inside
the well with a characteristic time much shorter than
the lifetime of the through. Trapping can be avoided
by Coulomb collisions [27] or by the ion-wave instabil-
ity, both probably one outcome of the stress energy un-
balance as previously mentioned. We consider a simple
Brownian motion model for the slow electrons to obtain
the scattering time τ , and the lifetime T of the well. A
Fermi-like model will allow us to obtain the slow electron
energy distribution function.

Considering the slow electron jiggling within the well,

the estimated scattering time is

In Table IV we summarize scattering and trapping

times for a few gases.

C. Power-law slow electrons distribution function

As slow electrons are trapped by the electric ﬁeld inver-
sion, some process must be at work to pull them out from
the well. We suggest that ﬂuctuations of the electric ﬁeld
in the plasma (with order of magnitude of Ec)act over
electrons giving energy to the slow ones, which collide
with those irregularities as with heavy particles. From
this mechanism it results a gain of energy as well a loss.
This model was ﬁrst advanced by E. Fermi [26] when de-
veloping a theory of the origin of cosmic radiation. We
shall focus here on the rate at which energy is acquired.
The average energy gain per collision by the trapped

electrons (in order of magnitude) is given by

∆w = U w(t),

(47)

with U ∼= E 2
N collisions the electrons energy will be

c and where w is their kinetic energy. After

w(t) = εt exp

U t
τ (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

(48)

with εt being their thermal energy, typical of slow elec-
trons. The time between scattering collisions is τ . As-
suming a Poisson distribution P (t) for electrons escaping
from the trapping, then we state

P (t) = exp(−t/τ )dt/T.

(49)

The probability distribution of the energy gained is a
function of one random variable (the energy), such as

fw(w)dw = P {w < ¯w < w + dw}.

(50)

This density fw(w) can be determined in terms of the
density P(t). Denoting by t1 = T the real root of the
equation w = w(t1 = T ), then it can be readily shown
that slow electrons obey in fact to the following power-
law distribution function

FIG. 4: Slow electrons distribution function vs. energy, for
the same conditions as presented in Table 4. Solid curve: Ar,
broken curve: N2.

Like many man made and naturally occurring phenom-
ena (e.g., earthquakes magnitude, distribution of in-
come), it is expected the trapped electron distribution
function to be a power-law (see Eq. 51), hence 1 + τ
c T =

n, with n = 2 ÷ 4 as a reasonable guess. Hence, we
estimate the trapping time to be

(52)

Fig.1 shows the slow electrons distribution function
pumped out from the well for two cases: Ar (solid curve),
and N2 (broken curve). It was chosen a power exponent
n = 2. Those distributions show that the higher conﬁn-
ing time is associated with less slow electrons present in
the well. When the width of the well increases (from solid
to broken curve) the scattering time become longer, and
as well the conﬁning time, due to a decrease of the relative
number of slow electrons per given energy. This mecha-
nism of pumping out of slow (trapped) electrons from the
well can possibly explains the generation of electrostatic
plasma instabilities.

The survival frequency of trapped electrons is νt = 1/T .
As the electrons diﬀusion coeﬃcient are typically higher
in atomic gases, it is natural to expect plasma instabil-
ities and waves with higher frequencies in atomic gases.
This result is in agreement with a kinetic analysis of in-
stabilities in microwave discharges [31]. In addition, the
length of the NG will inﬂuence the magnitude of the fre-
quencies registered by the instabilities, since wavelengths
have more or less space to build-up. Table IV summarizes
the previous results for some atomic and molecular gases.
The transport parameters used therefor where calculated
by solving the electron Boltzmann equation, under the
two-term approximation, in a steady-state Townsend dis-
charge [32].

This paper reviews, and extends when necessary, the
physics of the electric ﬁeld reversals in a glow discharge.
We listed and studied how the structure of a glow dis-
charge is related to the electrons and ions kinetics, de-
scribed related experimental results, and have shown
how the ﬁeld reversals help to maintain the discharge.
To this end diﬀerent methods to describe the diﬀerent
groups of electrons generated in a glow discharge have
been presented: the nonlocal approach of Kolobov and
Tsendin [5]; the simple analytic ﬂuid model by Boeuf
and Pitchford [10]; the theoretical analysis developed
by Kudryavtsev and Toinova [20], and the dielectric-like
model [22].

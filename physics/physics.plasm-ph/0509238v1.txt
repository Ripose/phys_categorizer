Abstract

A rigorous and most general covariant kinetic formalism is developed to study the nonlinear waves

interaction in relativistic Vlasov plasmas. The typical nonlinear plasma reaction is a nonlinear

current measured by the nonlinear plasma conductivity, and these quantities are derived here on

the basis of relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell equations. Knowing the nonlinear plasma conductivity

allows us to determine all plasma modes nonlinearly excited in plasma. The general covariant form

of nonlinear conductivity is provided ﬁrst for any value of plasma temperature and for the whole

complex frequency plane by a correct analytical continuation. The further analysis is restricted to

a correct relativistic particle distribution which is vanishing for particle speeds greater than speed

of light. In the limit of nonrelativistic plasma temperatures the covariant nonlinear conductivity

is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the standard noncovariant nonrelativistic results which are reached

only in the formal limit of an inﬁnitely large speed of light c

INTRODUCTION

Under various sources of free energy plasma becomes a high nonlinear dispersive medium.

Numerous nonlinear wave processes occur in both laboratory and space plasmas [[1]]: e.g. in

laser plasma interaction the high intensity pump waves stimulate the parametric instabilities

and the nonlinear collisionless damping of plasma waves; or the shock structures arising in

many astrophysical plasmas fed the well-known two-stream (electrostatic or Weibel) insta-

bilities [[2]].

Even for relativistic temperatures the collisionless (Vlasov) plasma condition applies to

many astrophysical scenarios where dissipation is dominated by wave-particle interactions

rather than binary collisions. In these cases a fundamental kinetic description is required, but

the existing standard nonrelativistic results could be improved by the covariant relativistic

approaches which reproduce the general and relativistically correct dispersion relations in

any frame that is not necessarily inertial.

In the ﬁrst earlier treatment [[3]] (named as Paper I in the next) the nonlinear three-waves

interaction have been investigated in the case of relativistic Vlasov plasma with isotropic

distribution function of particles. Using the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell equations the new

relativistic forms of nonlinear current and nonlinear plasma conductivity have been derived.

The nonlinear current is the typical nonlinear response of a plasma medium where a pump

and an idler wave interact exciting a third signal wave.

The nonlinear current seems to play an important role also in the saturation stage of

plasma ﬁlamentation arising in laser plasma interaction [[4]] or in the jet-plasma astro-

physical structures [[5]]: shocks in GRBs sources, pulsar outﬂows, or solar winds. The

ﬁlamentation instability is the ﬁnal stage of nonlinear waves interaction when the plasma

distribution function is anisotropic and which persists as long as the external perturbation

is suﬃciently strong. This case should be analyzed using an anisotropic bi-Maxwellian dis-

tribution function to calculate the nonlinear conductivity, and it will be discused in the next

papers of this series.

In the present paper we continue to develop a fully relativistic and covariant kinetic

theory of nonlinear plasma waves interaction providing an analytical model to estimate the

plasma nonlinear response. Starting from the Maxwell equations we show in Section II that

two waves coupling leads to a nonlinear component of plasma current which generates the

2

third wave signal. To ﬁnd the corresponding nonlinear ﬂuctuation of plasma density we use

as in Paper I the relativistic nonlinear Vlasov equation to obtain the general form of the

nonlinear current arising from the interaction of two waves with any polarization and any

direction of propagation.

Considering only longitudinal waves the general covariant expression of nonlinear plasma

conductivity is derived in Section III for any subluminal or superluminal phase velocity

and for the whole complex frequency plane. The nonlinear conductivity is then calculated

in Section IV using an appropriate relativistic distribution function which is vanishing for

particle speeds greater than speed of light. Knowing the nonlinear conductivity we could

ﬁnd the electric ﬁelds of interacting waves as solutions of nonlinear (coupled) equations

system (42)-(44) from Paper I.

For nonrelativistic plasma temperatures we derive in Section V apparently for the ﬁrst

time, the covariant expression of nonlinear conductivity in terms of well documented plasma

dispersion function [[6]]. We show that the covariant form is markedly diﬀerent from the

standard classic expression of nonlinear conductivity provided by the noncovariant nonrel-

ativistic theory and which can be obtained only in the unphysical limit of inﬁnite speed of

light c

(because the classical theory assumes all waves as being subluminal).

II. BASIC FRAMEWORK

The basic model followed in this paper is an inﬁnitely extended collisionless plasma of

high temperature electrons which requires that the electrons be treated relativistically. For
plasmas with low collisionality (νc/ωp ≃
electromagnetic coupling of the particles, not to collisions. Therefore, the relativistic Vlasov-

g << 1), the cooperative motion is due to the

Maxwell equations are used, and for plasma ﬂuctuations with suﬃciently large amplitudes,

the nonlinear forms of them are required (see notations and equations (13)-(17) from Paper

I).

Relation (27) is the general covariant form of longitudinal conductivity plasma response

to the interaction of two (longitudinal) plasma waves. We can use it to ﬁnd the expressions

of plasma waves solving the nonlinear equation system (42)-(44) from Paper I. But relation

(27) is not valid for the whole complex frequency plane because it has been obtained with

assumption of a positive imaginary part, Γ > 0, of frequency ω = ωr + ıΓ (see also in Paper

I). The index ”+” in (27) indicates this condition.

B. Analytic continuation for subluminal waves

As we noted, the relation (27) holds for positive values of the imaginary part of the

frequency Γ =

dispersion relations for negative values of the imaginary part of frequency, Γ < 0 (i.e.

ℑ

ω > 0, corresponding to

z > 0.

In order to derive the corresponding

z < 0), we have to analytically continue the integrals in (27) into the negative imaginary

ℑ
plane of the complex variable z.

For superluminal waves generally deﬁned in unmagnetized plasma by

VI. CONCLUSION

On the basis of relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell equations we have developed a covariant

kinetic formalism to determine the nonlinear plasma conductivity which allows us to ﬁnd

all the plasma waves nonlinearly excited in plasma. The general covariant form of nonlinear

conductivity is provided ﬁrst for any value of plasma temperature and for the whole complex

frequency plane by a correct analytical continuation. Then, we have restricted the analysis

to an appropriate relativistic particle distribution which is vanishing for particle speeds

greater than speed of light. And in the limit of nonrelativistic plasma temperatures we

have derived apparently for the ﬁrst time the covariant nonlinear conductivity which is

signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the standard noncovariant nonrelativistic results. Only in the

strictly unphysical formal limit of an inﬁnitely large speed of light c

the covariant

→ ∞

forms reduce to the standard expressions.

Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence is nothing like Kolmogorov’s in the self similar regime

(Dated: September 25, 2013)

An increasing number of numerical simulations and experiments describing the turbulent spectrum
of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) mixing layers came to light over the past few years. Results reported in
recent studies allow to rule out a turbulence `a la Kolmogorov as a mechanism acting on a self similar
RT turbulent mixing layer. A diﬀerent mechanism is presented, which complies with both numerical
and experimental results and relates RT ﬂow to other buoyant ﬂows.

A Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability [1, 2] occurs when-
ever a light ﬂuid, ρ1, pushes a heavy ﬂuid, ρ2, or simi-
larly, when a heavy ﬂuid on top of a lighter ﬂuid is sub-
ject to a gravitational acceleration. The understanding
of such instability in the developed turbulent regime is
of primary interest to many ﬁelds of physics and tech-
nology since it is an important cause of mixing between
two ﬂuids of diﬀerent density.
In astrophysics for in-
stance, it is responsible for the outward acceleration of
a thermonuclear ﬂame in type Ia supernovae [3], but it
also plays an important role in shaping the interstellar
medium so that new stars can be born [4]. The technol-
ogy of conﬁnement fusion also relies on a good under-
standing of RT mixing [5] and ways to reduce it [6]. The
RT ﬂow of two incompressible ﬂuids in the low Atwood
limit,
1 (Boussinesq approx-
imation), is governed by a concentration equation (1),
the Navier Stokes equation supplemented with a buoy-
ant source term (2) and the incompressibility constraint

ber, experimental investigations of E(k) [16] and Ec(k)
[10, 17, 18] have been carried out. A quick inspection
of these results shows that no consensus arises concern-
ing the shape of these spectrum. From a theoretical
point of view, the situation is not more satisfactory. In
[19] it is claimed that the Kolmogorov-Obukhov scheme,
k−5/3, holds in 3D RT mixing given that the ef-
E(k)
fect of buoyancy on turbulence, although fundamental at
the largest scale, becomes irrelevant at smaller scales. In
[20] the particular RT time scale 1/√kgA at wave number
k has been postulated to vary like the turbulent spectral
transfer time scale ǫ k−4 E−2(k) yielding an RT turbulent
k−7/4. Another troublesome point is
spectrum E(k)
that there are no convincing objective criteria to assert
whether or not an RT ﬂow has reached the gravitational
self similar regime but to plot the mixing zone width L(t)
g t2 and see if there is a straight line somewhere
versus
without any information on the expected slope. Subse-
quently, suggesting the possibility of any behavior of the
velocity spectrum in the self similar regime and compar-
ing it to experiments and simulations can be dubious if
it is not known for certain that these experiment or sim-
ulations have reached this regime. So, the ﬁrst aim of
this paper will be to describe such an objective criterion.
The ultimate goal will be to prove that the Kolmogorov
mechanism does not explain the observed numerical and
experimental results. A theory, based on a spectral equa-
tion, will be presented which shows that a balance mech-
anism between buoyancy and spectral energy transfer can
settle at low wave numbers in the self similar regime.

A

The RT developed turbulent regime, as complex as it
may look, is thought to evolve self similarly [21]. The
size of the largest signiﬁcant turbulent structure, there-
fore, grows like the size of the turbulent mixing zone
g t2 [12] where α is the
which evolves as L(t) = α
mixing-zone-width growth rate parameter whose value
0.06 experimentally and between 0.03 and
is around
0.07 numerically.
It can be assumed that at low wave
numbers in the self similar regime the velocity spectrum
E(k, t) = 0 for k < kl(t), where kl(t) is the wave number
corresponding to the maximum of the velocity spectrum
(this point will be called λ due to the shape of the ideal-

independently of the slope of the spectrum (nl). This is
a universal condition in the sense that both those who
believe in a Kolmogorov scenario nl = 5/3 and others
will agree on.
It is objective since it amounts to look
for a straight line in the log(E)-log(k) plot whose slope,
this time, is unambiguously determined (
2). Therefore,
such behavior should be checked whenever an RT ﬂow is
said to have reach a self similar regime. This regime
requires large resolution so that the mixing zone can ex-
pand and reach the self similar regime before it collides
with the simulation box border. Indeed, large resolution
simulations [8, 14, 15] show the mark (5) of the self sim-
ilar regime which starts near the end. The only experi-
mental result which shows the evolution of the velocity
spectrum [16] also complies with this rule.

−

It is now possible to select, among all the simulations
cited in the introduction, those which have reached the
self similar regime. If it is assumed that RT turbulence
follows Kolmogorov’s mechanism [19, 21], the turbulent
spectrum has the well known form E(k) = CK ǫ2/3 k−5/3.
Using Eq.(4) with nl = 5/3 > 1 and the self similar laws

, it is straightforward to conclude [19]
for kl(t) and

t1/4 and also that
that ǫ

t2/3. This conclusion is refuted by
Ψl(t) = CK ǫ(t)2/3
recent DNS/LES simulations [8, 14] showing the velocity
spectrum evolution in time. Even though it is not stated
in these references, it can clearly be noticed that the level
of the velocity spectrum at low wave number, Ψl(t), does
not grow as time evolves but remains still. This is an
important observation which constrained the mechanism
of RT turbulence.

In order to understand the mechanism, it is worth writ-

generalisation of Lin’s equation [22]) out of the averaged

plication as a model to industrial problems as for the
particular physical features that it reveals. The ﬁrst
term in the rhs (T term) is the so called spectral energy
transfer. In the case of a forced turbulence (Kolmogorov
mechanism), this term is negative in the low wave num-
ber, to balance with the production, it is approximately
zero throughout the inertial range and become positive in
the dissipative range to balance with dissipation. It ac-
counts for the non linear triad interaction responsible for
the forward cascade in forced turbulence and must verify

tion of viscosity in the spectral evolution equation and
R
it is responsible for dissipation at high wave number in
forced turbulence. The last term, on the other hand, has
never been written to the author’s knowledge. It is this
term which makes RT ﬂows and buoyant ﬂows in gen-
eral so diﬀerent. As expected intuitively, it depends on
the concentration spectrum because it is a concentration
heterogeneity that induces motion through buoyancy. In
fact, for a perfectly homogeneous mixing the buoyancy

production is zero because Ec 6

It is now possible to describe the evolution of the veloc-
ity spectrum in an RT mixing layer. Let us imagine that
a peaked initial condition is chosen at a wave number
. If initial velocity is not strong
well above
enough, the ﬂow will be damped by viscosity because
is the threshold above which spontaneous
∼
RT instability is inhibited. On the contrary, if a veloc-
ity kick is given to both ﬂuids at the interface, the path
in the spectral domain will start roughly upward (due
to velocity kick) until it reaches the NL domain where
non linearity overcomes viscosity and buoyancy. The
spectral equation ((7) without buoyant term) then de-
scribes a free decaying turbulence. Two outcomes are
then possible : either a part of the free decaying spec-
trum reaches the NLg border and is then carried away
by buoyancy or it does not and the whole spectrum falls
back into the viscosity domain. Now let us imagine that a
peaked initial condition is chosen at a wave number below
. Spontaneous RT can then occur. The clos-

A
(cid:0)
, the fastest is the linear growth. The
est to
spectrum grows until it reaches the NL domain where
mode coupling can start. At the beginning, since both
E(k) and Ec(k) are peaked around the initial wave num-
ber, so is the buoyancy production which then acts like a
narrow band forcing. A Kolmogorov spectrum can then
settle between the initial wave number and NLν (where
energy is dissipated). This is precisely what is observed
after the linear growth regime in the mixing phase. As
time goes by, both spectrums spread over a wider range of
wave numbers and when mixing is established, produc-
tion becomes broad band and spectral energy transfer
must balance with buoyancy at the lowest wave number.
That is why, the velocity spectrum lies alongside ENLg(k)
(see Fig.1), given by (8) and also (11) in the self similar
RT case.

This balance mechanism is observed for Rayleigh-
B´enard (RB) ﬂows for it explains its velocity and con-
centration spectrum layout. RT and RB ﬂows are both
governed by the same set of equation (concentration is
replaced by temperature in RB) but boundary condi-
tions in RB are independent of time and so are the veloc-
ity and concentration spectrum. At low wave numbers,

Moreover, since (8) must be valid in RB ﬂows (Eq. (11)

must also be true. Together with the previous relation
it is then found that nl = 11
5 = 1.4,
which is exactly the Bolgiano-Obukov [23] scaling found
in RB ﬂows [24, 25]. This mechanism is also corroborated
by experiment [16] where velocity spectrum level at low
wave numbers can be seen to decrease in time although
the turbulent kinetic energy increases. That means, (11),

mechanism is ruled out since it predicts a velocity spec-

In the high wave numbers, depending on the value of
the Schmidt number, two things can happen. Sc <

∼
means that buoyancy production cannot exist below ν2 k
and cannot balance with viscosity to create gν (see
Fig.1).
In this case, the velocity spectrum exponen-
tially decreases after it goes through N Lν. Otherwise,
if Sc
1 it is possible to prove that an equilibrium
between buoyancy and viscosity exists by performing a
linear analysis of (1,2,3) with c(x, t) = c0 + c1(k, t) e−ikx
and u(x, t) = u0 + u1(k, t) e−ikx. This solution can be
thought of as the low wave number contributions of u
and c with perturbation corresponding to higher wave
number turbulent ﬂuctuations. They can be plugged in
equations (1,2,3) and after some algebra it is found that

in agreement with Eq.(10). Therefore, the velocity spec-
trum coincide with Egν (k) in the high Schmidt number
limit (see Fig.1).

As a conclusion, it can be stated that self similar-
ity hypothesis together with equilibrium of spectral en-
ergy transfer with buoyancy at low wave numbers con-
strained velocity spectrum in a way incompatible with
Kolmogorov mechanism. It does not provide the exact
slope of the concentration spectrum ncl at low wave num-
bers but assuming that it lies between 1 and 2 we obtain

a result. The most important result, here, is that veloc-
ity spectrum at low wave numbers is shown to be very
sensitive to concentration spectrum. Not only at the low-
est wave number, as previously assumed [19], but on a
wider range. Nevertheless, a Kolmogorov mechanism is
not ruled out at intermediate wave numbers. It can be a
transition process from low wave numbers to high wave
numbers as discussed in the text. In this case, it does not

belief that “the cascade rate is [...] equal to dissipation”
in the self similar regime is always presupposed although
it is a strong hypothesis for buoyant ﬂows. It does not
have to hold considering the importance of the buoyant
production. It would not be in contracdiction with turbu-

Abstract. A high-density magnetized plasma has been studied for understanding of plasma
dynamics in partially ionized plasmas. While research of plasma dynamics on fully ionized
plasma has been developed in the past century as well as on weakly ionized plasma, the
understanding of partially ionized plasma is a current issue especially in considering divertor
plasmas, industrial plasmas and ionosphere plasma. In this paper, the experimental result of
ion ﬂow ﬁeld associated with a vortex formation in a partially ionized plasma is presented.
The most remarkable result is that the direction of rotation is opposite to that of the ExB drift.
The experiments have been performed in the high density plasma experiment (HYPER-
I) device at the National Institute for Fusion Science. The HYPER-I device produces a
cylindrical plasma (30 cm diameter and 200 cm axial length) by electron cyclotron resonance
(ECR) heating with a microwave (2.45 GHz, 80 kW maximum) launched at an open end of
the chamber. The plasma density and the electron temperature are about 1013cm−
3 and 5 eV,
respectively, for the operation pressure 30 mTorr (Argon), which is several ten times higher
than that of usual ECR plasma experiments.

In the experimental condition described above, a tripolar vortex has spontaneously been
formed. Ion ﬂow velocity ﬁeld, obtained with a directional Langmuir probe, shows that the
B drift. Measurement of neutral
rotational direction of each vortex is opposite to that of the E
density proﬁle reveals that there is a steep density gradient of the neutrals around the vortex,
thus inward momentum of the neutrals is generated due to the density gradient. The anti-E

rotation is caused by the eﬀective force attributable to radial momentum transfer from the
directed neutrals to the ions with charge-exchange collision. The present experiment shows
that this eﬀective force may dominate the ambipolar-electric ﬁeld and drive the anti-E

1. Introduction

Understanding of plasma dynamics is an important and attractive issue in plasma physics.
While research of plasma dynamics on fully ionized plasma has been developed in the past
century as well as on weakly ionized plasma, recognition of common feature of dynamics
observed in partially ionized plasmas becomes a current topic. Partially ionized plasma
is deﬁned as a plasma of intermediate degree of ionization between fully ionized plasma
and weakly ionized plasma. The ionization degree of partially ionized plasma is typically
of the order of ten percent, where adequate neutral particles and ions (and also electrons)
coexist and interact with each other. Interesting phenomena related to plasma dynamics in
partially ionized plasmas have been observed; for example, ﬂow reversal has been observed
in the scrape oﬀ layer of magnetically conﬁned plasmas,[1] ion upﬂow in ionospheric plasma.
Spatial dependence of the ionization degree[2] and the role of neutral particle itself are
considered to be keys of these phenomena. We have observed another phenomenon related to
plasma dynamics in a laboratory plasma with partially ionized condition. The phenomenon is
spontaneous formation of a tripolar vortex. The tripolar vortex consists of an elliptic center
vortex and two bean-shaped satellites, which have opposite signs of polarity of rotation to that
of the center vortex, and remains stationary in time during the whole discharge period.

Recently, tripolar vortices were observed in the ocean (the Bay of Biscay) and in a
rotating ordinary ﬂuid to be self-organized from a complex initial condition,[3] and from a
forced initial conditions.[4, 5] These results suggest that the tripolar vortex is a basic coherent
structure in rotating ﬂuids[6] or ﬂuids subjected to the Coriolis force. A plasma in a magnetic
ﬁeld is equivalent to those ﬂuids because the Lorentz force has the same eﬀect as the Coriolis
force, and hence it might be possible to occur a tripolar vortex in a plasma.[7]

×

In this paper, the experimental observation of a tripolar vortex in a magnetized partially
ionized plasma is presented. A remarkable characteristic is that the tripolar vortex always
appears with a deep density depression of neutral particles and is conﬁned in its valley. The
B direction,
ﬂow velocity measurements revealed that each vortex rotates in the anti-E
suggesting that there exists an eﬀective radial force acting on the ions, which overcomes the
radial electric ﬁeld. We propose that the charge-exchange collisions between the ions and
neutrals may produce the eﬀective force through the net momentum transfer. When there
is a strong inhomogeneity in the neutral density proﬁle and the charge-exchange collision
is dominant, a directed momentum of the ﬂow of neutrals is brought into the ions by the
charge-exchange collision, producing an eﬀective force through the net momentum transfer.
It is shown that the eﬀective force may dominate the ambipolar electric ﬁeld and drive the
anti-E
B vortical motion of ions. The tripolar vortex observed in the present experiments is
considered to be a neutral-induced tripolar vortex. The existence of neutral particles usually
causes a dissipative eﬀect, in which a dissipative instability[8] and a modiﬁcation of the mode
pattern take place.[10, 9] It is worth pointing out that the existence of neutral particles may
change the ion dynamics qualitatively. In Sec. 2, the experimental setup is described, and the

2. Experimental Setup

The experiments have been performed in the high-density plasma experiment (HYPER-
I) device at National Institute for Fusion Science.[11] The HYPER-I device consists of a
cylindrical chamber (30 cm in diameter, 200 cm in axial length) and ten magnetic coils, which

I device is shown in Fig. 1. Plasmas are produced and sustained by the electron cyclotron
resonance (ECR) heating. A microwave of frequency 2.45 GHz is generated by a klystron
ampliﬁer (80 kW CW maximum) and is launched from an open end of the chamber, where
the high-ﬁeld side condition (ωce > ω, ωce: electron cyclotron frequency, ω: wave frequency)
is satisﬁed. The magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is a so-called magnetic beach with the ECR
point at 90 cm from the microwave injection window. An electron cyclotron wave is excited
in the plasma and fully absorbed before reaching the ECR point.[12] The plasma dimension
is 30 cm in diameter and 200 cm in axial length. The typical electron densities are 1012 cm−

The ion ﬂow velocities have been measured with a directional Langmuir probe (DLP),
which collects a directed ion current through a small opening (1 mm diam) made on the side
wall of the ceramic insulator (3 mm diam). The detailed structure of the DLP and its validity
for measuring the ion ﬂow velocity is given in Ref. [13, 14]. The ﬂow velocity component
at a certain angle θ with respect to the reference axis, v(θ), is obtained by measuring two ion
saturation currents, Is(θ) and Is(θ + π), and by using the following relation:[13]

where θ is the angle between the normal of electrode of the DLP and the reference axis, and Cs
is the ion sound speed. α is a factor of the order of unity, and is calibrated by cross-checking
with other ﬂow-measurement method such as passive[15] or laser-induced[16] spectroscopy.
A two-dimensional velocity vector at a certain spatial point v(r) on a plane perpendicular to
the magnetic ﬁeld is determined by measuring the two components of the velocity vector. A
vector ﬁeld plot of the ﬂow velocity is constructed from a data set of velocity components
obtained by a pair of DLPs mounted on the radial ports located at angles
45◦ from the
±
vertical axis (see Fig. 2). The insertion angle is changed up to
34◦, and the insertion chords
with every 2 degrees of increment (decrement) are shown in Fig. 2. There are about 900 cross-
points in the cross section, and the local velocity vectors are determined on each cross-point.
The distance between the nearest cross-points is about 7 mm in the central region and about
11 mm near the chamber wall. From the original data set with the variable distances, we
3
produce a new data set on the lattice points with equal spacing (5 mm) by interpolation, and
then make the vector ﬁeld plot of the ﬂow velocity. The radial proﬁle of density, electron
temperature and space potential have been measured with a Langmuir probe.

the visible light emitted to the direction parallel to the axis of the cylindrical plasma. The

is determined so as to give the equal value of ni(r) at the point r = 10 cm. There is a
good agreement between the two. Since the optical measurement provides a line-integrated
quantity, this agreement suggests that the observed structure is axially homogeneous. In fact,
we have conﬁrmed by the Langmuir probe measurement that the observed structure is axially
homogeneous at least more than 90 cm. It has also been conﬁrmed that the bean-shaped bright
regions shown in Fig. 3(b) are the ion density clumps.

In accordance with the appearance of bright spots, a neutral density depression occurs in
the central region of the plasma [Fig. 4(d)]. It should be emphasized that when the double-
peaked structure is generated in the ion density proﬁle, the neutral density proﬁle becomes
a double-minimum distribution as shown in Fig. 4(d). Moreover, there is a close relation
between the positions of the steepest density gradient of the ions and the neutrals. The width
of ion clump and that of neutral depression exhibit a quite well agreement, suggesting that the
observed ion density structure is conﬁned in the neutral density depression, and there might
be a dynamical coupling between the two.

The vector ﬁeld plot of the ion ﬂow velocity and the vorticity distribution[17] for a
double-peaked structure are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5(a) indicates the ﬂow velocity ﬁeld
with the contour map of ion density in the background, and Fig. 5(b) the distribution of z-
component of vorticity, which is constructed from the velocity data by using the following
equation: ω = (rotv)z ≃
In this calculation, the path of integration is so
chosen to pass through the four velocity vectors on the minimum lattice points of the velocity
ﬁeld, and ∆S is the area surrounded by the integration path. As seen in Fig. 5(a), there are
two clockwise vortical motions in both sides, which correspond to the ion density clumps.
Between these clumps, there presents a counterclockwise motion whose center is a little bit
shifted upward. Since the velocity ﬁeld pattern is a superposition of vortical motion and
other ﬂows such as the diﬀusive ﬂux, the vorticity distribution contour is much more useful
to recognize the existence of vortices.[18] Figure 5(b) clearly shows the existence of three
vortices; one vortex locates in the center with a positive polarity (counterclockwise rotation)
and two satellites in the both sides with negative polarities (clockwise rotation). Therefore, the
observed ﬂow structure is a tripolar vortex.[19] Tripolar vortices have been already found in
ordinary ﬂuids. Unlike these vortices in ordinary ﬂuids,[4, 5] which slowly rotate as a whole,
the global vortex pattern in the plasma is stationary in the laboratory frame, which suggests
that there exists a vortex solution with zero eigenfrequency. The existence of stationary
tripolar solution in a plasma has been shown in Ref. [20].

horizontal chord (y = 0) is a double-peaked one, and the half of the proﬁle is shown in Fig. 6,
in which the corresponding neutral density proﬁle is also depicted. In evaluating the neutral

on the atomic cross section is taken into account. As seen in the ﬁgure, the peak position of

B rotations
due to this potential proﬁle are counterclockwise for the satellite vortices, and clockwise for
the core vortex, which are apparently opposite to the experimental observations. There should
be a radially inward force (or momentum transfer) to explain the observed rotation of ions.
The probable mechanism of generation of inward force is a net momentum transfer between
the ions and neutrals. As shown in Fig. 4, a steep density gradient in the neutrals coexists with

absolute value of neutral density at the tripolar vortex region from the operation pressure
measured at the chamber wall, there is uncertainty of density depression. This corresponds to
an enhancement factor of several for Dc determined by the operation pressure. In Fig. 7, we
take Deﬀ = 5Dc as one example. For comparison, the E

vortex coexists with a deep density hole of neutrals, and the rotation direction is opposite to
that of the E
B drift. When a steep density gradient of neutrals is present, a net momentum
transfer may take place through the charge-exchange interaction, producing an eﬀective force
acting on the ion ﬂuids. Our experiment shows that this eﬀective force may overcome the
B rotation. Since the existence of neutrals
radial electric ﬁeld, and generates an anti-E
×
usually brings a dissipation term into the equation of motion, it is of importance to note that
the existence of neutrals may qualitatively change the dynamical behavior of ions. The present
result will be important in considering plasma behavior in partially ionized plasmas such as
ionospheric plasmas and surface plasmas in conﬁned systems.

Abstract

We show that the time dependent version of Sato’s equation, when applied to capacitative

rf sheaths is no longer independent of the electric ﬁeld of the space charge, and discuss the use

of the equation for a speciﬁc sheath model.

Introduction

A few years ago, Sato derived an expression for the current ﬂowing in the external circuit due to the

motion of charged particles in the gap within a discharge tube [1], for a constant voltage applied to

the gap. Very recently, this work was generalised by Morrow & Sato [2] to include time-dependent

applied voltages. They used an energy balance equation to obtain their results, which in both cases

were independent of the space charge eﬀects.

While their methods and inferences drawn thereby are striking in their elegance and simplicity, one

must exercise caution while applying them, for in certain situations, these can lead to results which

are quite the reverse of the inferences drawn in their papers, as we show here.

In a high voltage radio frequency discharge tube, there is a high concentration of positive ions at

the electron-depleted dark space region adjoining the electrode, and a consequent build-up of ﬁeld

distortion, so that one expects a time and frequency dependence of the conduction process. The

build-up of ﬁeld distortion can therefore be modelled by a two-layer capacitor of the Maxwell-Wagner

type [3].

The plasma state is characterised by equal numbers of positive and negative charges, but because of

diﬀusion eﬀects and recombinations on boundary surfaces in the discharge tube, there is charge deple-

tion in the adjoining gas phase, resulting in the formation of a thin sheath. Electrons diﬀuse fastest,

since they are lightest and have high energies, and they leave behind them a surplus of positive

charge and a plasma potential which is positive relative to the walls. Since there is a larger number

of charged particles in the central plasma regions of the tube, and hence better conductivity there,

almost all of the potential drop occurs across the sheath. The clear diﬀerence in the magnitudes

of the potential at the plasma and at the sheath, leads one to describe the plasma-sheath system

in a discharge tube by a two-layered capacitor, with a dielectric coeﬃcient ǫsh for the sheath region.

It is shown in this work that such a representation of the plasma-sheath system leads to terms

in Sato’s equation, which depend upon the sheath potential and ﬁeld. We calculate the non-zero

contributions to the current in the external circuit from the space charge ﬁeld and the sheath

capacitance for a symmetric RF discharge for a simpliﬁed electrode geometry, in the case of the

Godyak-Lieberman (GL) theory [4,5] for RF sheaths, using this energy balance method.

2. The energy balance method of Sato & Morrow

The continuity equations which describe the development in time t of the space charge in a gap in

air are [6]:

∂ne
∂t
∂np
∂t
∂nn
∂t

= neαve − neηve − nenpβ1 − ∇ · (neve − De∇ne)

= neαve − nenpβ1 − nnnpβ2 − ∇ · (npvp − Dp∇np)

= neηve − nnnpβ2 − ∇ · (nnvn − Dn∇nn)

(1)

where ne, np and nn denote the electron, positive ion and negative ion densities respectively, ve, vp
and vn denote the drift velocity vectors of the electrons, positive ions & negative ions respectively,

α is the electron ionization coeﬃcient, η the attachment coeﬃcient, and β1 and β2 are the electron-

positive ion and negative ion-positive ion recombination coeﬃcients respectively. De, Dp and Dn are

the diﬀusion coeﬃcients for the electron, positive ion and negative ion respectively.

Combining these, one obtains the equation for the net space charge density ρ :

∂ρ
∂t

= e

∂(np − ne − nn)
∂t

= −e∇ · Γ

where e is the electron charge, and the total particle ﬂux Γ is given by

Γ = npvp − nnvn − neve − Dp∇np + Dn∇nn + De∇ne

One starts with these basic equations to study the electrodynamics of the charged particles in a

discharge tube. In an RF discharge tube, since most of the potential drop in the gap occurs across

the sheath, we treat the plasma-sheath system as a two-layer capacitor, with a dielectric constant

ǫsh for the sheath and the dielectric constant of free space ǫ0 for the plasma region.

The total current density J in the gap is

where the electric displacement D relates to the local ﬁeld E through the eﬀective complex dielectric

constant ǫ of the gap:

J = eΓ +

∂D
∂t

D = ǫE

This can be separated into a part Dsh describing the sheath, and a plasma part Dp:

D obeys Poisson’s equation :

D = ǫ0Ep + ǫshEsh = Dp + Dsh

∇ · D = ρ = ǫ0∇ · Ep + ∇ · (ǫshEsh)

while Ep satisﬁes Laplace’s equation:

∇ · Ep = 0

The plasma and sheath electric ﬁelds Ep and Esh are related to their respective potential distributions

through

Ep = −∇ψp

and Esh = −∇ψsh.

The energy balance equation can be used to relate the applied potential Va and the current I in the

external circuit, to the current density and the local ﬁeld in the gap through the volume integral

V dv over the discharge space:
R

Separating out the plasma and the sheath electric ﬁelds as:

VaI =

J.Edv

ZV

E = Ep + Esh

and making use of (4), one obtains:

where we have made use of the second of equations (9), performed an integration by parts,

representing a surface integration over the closed surface of the discharge space, and then used (2).

The second term in the right hand side of (12) can be rewritten using (7), and after again performing

an integration by parts, this term can be written as:

Next, we substitute (13) and (6) back into (12) to obtain:

The ﬁrst two terms within the ﬁrst volume integral on the right hand side of (14) constituted

the ﬁnal form of Sato’s equation derived in [2] for a time-dependent applied voltage. The boundary

condition chosen in [2] was, that ψsh was set to zero on both electrodes, and ψp was set to zero

on one electrode and to the applied voltage Va on the other. The authors in [2] obtained the gap

capacitance for a simple system from the second of the two terms in the ﬁrst volume integral.

5

On the other hand, by ascribing a non-trivial dielectric constant to the sheath, we have obtained

terms additional to those obtained in [2], and these extra terms depend upon the sheath ﬁeld and

potential.

3. Capacitative RF discharges

Low pressure plasma chambers are widely used in the material processing industry, such as in the

fabrication of semiconductor wafers, and in reactive ion etching. Many applications need high ion

energies which are generated by biasing the substrate with a radio frequency (RF) current source

[7,8]. Proper understanding of the electrodynamics involved in the sheath and near the plasma-

sheath boundary is thus highly desirable.

We consider a low density, low pressure plasma where a single power supply generates both the

discharge and the RF sheath. In this high frequency regime, the sheaths are primarily capacitative

in nature. The sheath is assumed to be collisionless. As is well known [4,5,9,10], the analysis of

sheath models depends on the ratio of the applied RF frequency ω to the ion plasma frequency ωpi

: when ω << ωpi,

the ions cross the sheath quickly and can instantaneously adjust to the applied

ﬁeld, and the properties of the sheath at diﬀerent times of the RF cycle are identical to those of a dc

sheath having a potential given by its instantaneous value (RF plus dc). However, when ω >> ωpi,

the inertia of the ions prevents them from adjusting to the applied ﬁeld, and they cannot respond

to its time variation. Then the ions cross the sheath in many RF periods and they respond only to

the dc ﬁeld – their dynamics is governed by the time-averaged ﬁeld in the sheath.

In the Godyak-Lieberman (GL) theory [4,5] (which we consider now), valid in the low density, high

frequency, high current regime [11], the ions are assumed to react only to the dc ﬁelds and not to the

RF ﬁelds. Also it is assumed that the transit time for the ions across the sheath is large compared to

the oscillation time. These assumptions lead the GL theory to predict monoenergetic ions impinging

on the substrate.

The ions are assumed to enter the sheath with a Bohm presheath velocity [12]

mi where
e is the ion charge, Te denotes the electron temperature in volts and mi is the ion mass. The

vB = eT

ion sheath-plasma boundary is taken to be stationary, and it is assumed that the electrons being

inertialess, respond to the instantaneous ﬁeld.

The GL theory holds in the regime in which the applied RF voltage is very large compared to Te,

so that one can assume that the electron Debye length λD everywhere within the sheath is much

smaller than the thickness of the ion sheath sm, implying that the electron density drops sharply

from ne = ni at the boundary with the plasma to ne = 0 in the sheath (at the electrode side).

6

The electron sheath penetrates into the ion sheath for a distance s(t) from the plasma-ion sheath

boundary at x = 0, and oscillates between a maximum thickness of sm and a minimum thickness

which is a few Debye lengths distant from the electrode, so that the electron sheath thickness is
eﬀectively sm − s(t).

We follow here, the analysis given in [4,5], but modiﬁed to include a ﬁnite dielectric constant ǫsh for

the sheath.

The ion ﬂux is conserved at the plasma-ion sheath boundary. This is expressed by:

where we denote the ion density ni(x) at the plasma-ion sheath boundary by n0, and vi is the ion

velocity. From energy conservation, one obtains:

where ¯ψsh(x) is the time averaged potential within the sheath. Combining (15) and (16), one obtains

for the ion density:

sheath:

In the GL theory, a spatially uniform, sinusoidal RF current density is assumed to pass through the

This current is carried by the electrons : J = −ne ds

dt , n being the electron density in the bulk
plasma at the sheath edge. As these electrons oscillate away from the electrode, they leave behind

a positive space charge space, pulling the positive ions there. At the electron sheath boundary, the

displacement current given by (18) must be equated to the conduction current, for continuity :

The instantaneous electric displacement Dsh(x, t) within the sheath is then given by:

The time-averaged electric displacement and potential are given by:

¯ne(x) being the time averaged electron density within the sheath.

The electric displacement ﬁeld within the sheath can be found by integrating (20):

This is done with the help of eqn.(19). Integrating its left hand side between the limits 0 and s, and

the right hand side between the limits 0 and ωt, one gets:

Since the GL theory is valid for the high frequency regime, one is interested in the time-averaged

quantities. These can be found from s(t). Lieberman denotes by 2φ, the phase during which x > s(t)
then for x ≈ 0, 2φ ≈ 0 , and for x ≈ sm, 2φ ≈ 2π. Because ne(x, t) = 0 during the part of the

so that −φ < ωt < φ , for x > s(t), and ωt = ±φ for x = s(t).

Then, from (23) and (24), one obtains:

If it is assumed that the plasma is a good conductor, then the electric ﬁeld in the plasma can be

taken as vanishing. Then it is the last term of (39) whose contribution is relevant to the discharge

current.

We consider again, the GL theory. For simplicity, we consider a symmetric discharge, and circular

electrodes of area A separated a distance d apart. Since the electric displacement and the potential

in the sheath are assumed to vary only in the axial direction and are assumed to be uniform in the

radial direction (implicit in the assumption that the charge density is uniform across the radius and

varies in the axial direction only), therefore, the area can be factored out of the surface integral. If
we make also the further assumption that ǫsh(x, t) ≈ ǫsh(t) , that is, that the spatial variation of

the sheath dielectric constant can be neglected, then one deduces, making use of (9) and (6) in (39),

that the contribution of the term:

gap capacitance is given by Csh , where :

where Dsh is given in (38). Notice, that as expected, this contribution is independent of the distance

d separating the electrodes and depends only upon the RF frequency, the electron temperature, the

area of the electrodes, n0, the amplitude of the current density, and the sheath dielectric constant

ǫsh.

In the case of RF discharges, the contribution to the total particle ﬂux Γ from diﬀusion of the

particles can be taken to be vanishing because the ions and electrons would be expected to react

faster to the rapidly changing applied RF voltage, than be inﬂuenced by the diﬀusion gradients in
a signiﬁcant way. Thus in these cases, only the nlvl , (l = i, e) terms in (3) would contribute to Γ.

The dc contribution to the voltage across the sheath comes from the dc ion current Ji. This

contributes to the Γ term in (14), for the current I in the external circuit :

where τ is the sheath relaxation time, it cannot be trivially factored out of the integral. One must

use the relation: ωt = φ before performing the integration over φ.

Discussion

We have shown that the time-dependent version of Sato’s equation is not independent of the space

charge electric ﬁeld. We consider the speciﬁc example of the Godyak-Lieberman model for a capaci-

tative RF discharge, and show that the sheath ﬁeld gives a non-negligible contribution to the gap ca-

pacitance of the discharge tube. Space charge eﬀects in a discharge tube can be analysed using energy

balance methods, by modelling the system as a two-layer Maxwell-Wagner capacitor. For frequencies

below RF frequencies also, the argument above shows that the electric ﬁeld and potential of the space

charge can give a non-zero contribution to the external current in the circuit, when the potential drop

across the space charge is appreciable. The diﬀusion terms could also give a non-trivial contribution

in these cases to the terms coming from space charge eﬀects :

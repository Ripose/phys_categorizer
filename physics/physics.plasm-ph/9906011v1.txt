Quasiclassical Theory and Simulations of Strongly
Coupled Plasmas

Abstract

A survey on the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of plasmas with
strong Coulomb interactions in the quasi-classical density-temperature region is
given. First the basic theoretical concepts describing nonideality are discussed.
The chemical picture is introduced. It is shown that the nonideal plasma sub-
system of the free charges has a rather large quasi-classical regime, where the
quantum eﬀects yield only corrections to the merely classical dynamics. The
plasma of free charges may be described by eﬀective potentials which incorporate
quantum eﬀects in an approximative way. The simplest eﬀective potentials are
only space-dependent, more advanced methods include momentum-dependent
interactions. On the basis of these potentials analytical results are derived and
simulation methods are developed. It is shown that eﬀective potentials are ap-
propriate for the description of thermodynamical as well as collective properties.

1 Introduction

Strongly coupled plasmas play an important role in nature, laboratory experiments,
and in technology [1, 2, 3, 4]. In these plasmas the mean potential energy is of the same
order of magnitude as the mean kinetic energy. Then we speak also about nonideal
plasmas. We will study in this work the dynamics, thermodynamic properties and
several collective eﬀects of strongly coupled non-degenerate one-component plasmas
(OCP) and symmetrical two-component plasmas (TCP). The investigation is restricted
to the subsystem of the free charges, which is deﬁned by means of the chemical picture
[2].
In this model the atoms, ions, and molecules are treated as separate species.
Therefore the constituents of the plasma are free electrons, free nuclei, ions, atoms, and
molecules. All species are treated on equal footing (principle of particle democracy).

The advantage of the chemical picture is that it is in many cases more appropriate for
the description of real plasmas [2]. In the chemical picture the free charges constitute
a well deﬁned subsystem of the plasma.

The main purpose of this work is the investigation of a quasi-classical dynamics
of free charges based on eﬀective potentials which may be used to describe thermo-
dynamical and collective properties of the free charges in this subsystem. We restrict
ourselves to the classical and near-classical region. Degeneracy is taken into account
only in an approximative way. Therefore the new results refer in particular to a region
where the plasma is still nondegenerated but nevertheless strongly coupled [6].
In
this work we will restrict ourselves to one-component plasmas and to two-component
e+) and sym-
plasmas which are anti-symmetrical with respect to the charges (e− =
metrical with respect to the densities (n+ = ni = n− = ne). In particular we consider
the model case of electron - positron plasmas m+ = me and H-plasmas with the mass-
relation m+ = 1840 me. We include the - so far unrealistic - case of mass - symmetrical
plasmas since in this case the thermodynamic functions and other analytic functions
describing the plasma are of particular simplicity. This is due to cancellation eﬀects
caused by the symmetry of the masses and anti-symmetry of the charges [7]. The
eﬀective potentials may be used to calculate correlation functions, thermodynamic
properties and structure factors of the free charges in semi-classical non-degenerate
quantum plasmas. The eﬀective potentials are ﬁrst obtained from the Slater sum
method. Then momentum-dependent potentials are introduced and discussed.

Characteristic parameters: The average distance of the electrons is the Wigner-
Seitz radius d = [3/4πne]1/3, the Bohr radius is deﬁned as aB = ¯h/me2. Other
characteristic lengths are the Landau length l = e2/kT , the De Broglie wave-length
Λi = h/[2πmikT ]1/2 of particles of species i and thermal wave length of relative motion
λij = ¯h/(2mijkT ). Furthermore we deﬁne the following dimensionless parameters:
(i) the coupling strength: Γ = l/d.
(ii) the degeneration parameter: niΛ3
(iii) the interaction parameter ξij =

i or θ = 2mkT /[¯h2 (3π2ne)2/3].
(eiej)/(kT λij).

−

Let us ﬁrst discuss the OCP: In the limit when the average distance is large in
comparison with the Bohr radius, i.e. if d
aB the electron gas behaves classical. The
≥
classical case was treated analytically by Ab´e and others [8], Monte Carlo calculations
in a wide range of Γ-values were carried out e.g. by Brush, Sahlin and Teller, DeWitt,
Ichimaru and other workers (see [9, 1, 3, 4]). Quantum corrections to the classical
case which are relevant at moderate values of rs were investigated by many authors
[1, 10, 11]. All the analytical calculations mentioned so far cover only limiting cases
as e.g. rs < 1 or Γ < 1. This is the reason why simulations are of large interest.
There exists extensive Monte Carlo (MC) calculations for the classical region [12].
Classical molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were presented by Hansen et al. [13].
The particular interest in MD calculations is connected with the fact, that they give

2

us also access to non-equilibrium properties [13].

For the TCP the available material is less exhaustive. We mention analytical calcu-
lations in the region of small Γ [5, 6, 15, 16] and Pad´e-approximations [2, 17] connecting
the analytically accessible regions. Further we mention several investigations devoted
to the simulation of two-component plasmas [18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 28]. In particular our
interest is devoted here to quasi-classical methods. Quasi-classical simulations of two-
component plasmas were pioneered by Norman and Hansen [18, 19]. These methods
attracted a great deal of interest because of their relative simplicity. A special di-
rection in developing simulation methods uses momentum-dependent potentials. The
main idea in this approach is to model quantum eﬀects by certain constraints in the
phase space constructing an appropriate Hamiltonian [22, 23, 24]. In particular the
Pauli exclusion principle is simulated by a momentum-dependent two-body interac-
tion.

2 Eﬀective Interaction Potentials

2.1 Space - Dependent Eﬀective Interactions

As pointed out the idea of quasi-classical methods is to incorporate quantum-mechanical
eﬀects (in particular the Heisenberg and the Pauli principles) by appropriate poten-
tials. Such a quasi-classical approach has of course several limits which are basically
connected with the trajectory concept. We mention for example the principal diﬃculty
to describe microspic quantum eﬀects as tunnelling, and macroscopic quantum eﬀects
as superﬂuidity and superconductance. Our aim is only the calculation of standard
macroscopic properties which have a well deﬁned classical limit. Since bound states
cannot be described classically our methods are restricted to the subsystem of free
charges. However, this is not a very serious restriction since most of the plasma prop-
erties are determined by the subsystem of the free charges.
The easiest way to arrive at eﬀective potentials describing quantum eﬀects is the use
of the so-called Slater sums which are deﬁned by the N - particle wave functions,

S(r1, . . . , rN ) = const

exp (

β En)

−
The integrals over the distributions S(r1, . . . , rN ) yield the correct quantum sta-
tistical partition function. The Slater sums for Coulombic systems were studied in
detail by several authors [1, 6]. With the knowledge of the Slater sums one gets exact
space distributions in equilibrium by the choice

U (N )(r1, . . . , rN ) =

kT ln S(r1, . . . , rN )

.

(2)

These potentials are often called quantum statistical eﬀective potentials and they
are used to calculate the partition function [1, 6, 18]. Thus one obtains the correct

−

thermodynamic functions. However, a severe disadvantage of this choice of the eﬀective
potentials eq.(2) is, that the momentum distributions are correctly described only in
the Boltzmann limit. Therefore this approach is principally restricted to the non-
degenerate region.

The Slater sum is an analogue of the classical Boltzmann factor and one deﬁnes

therefore an eﬀective potential by

Here Ψα and Eα denote the wave functions and energy levels of the pair ab.
A quantum mechanical calculation including the ﬁrst orders in the perturbation
theory was ﬁrst given by Kelbg; a similar more simple eﬀective potential was derived
by Deutsch and was used in the simulations by Hansen and McDonald [19].
The eﬀective potentials derived from perturbation theory do not include bound state
eﬀects. In order to treat the region, where bound states are of importance, a quite
diﬀerent approach is necessary [6]. The ﬁrst step is a transition to the chemical picture
i.e. bound and free states have to be separated. The second step is the derivation of
an eﬀective potential for the interaction of the free charges in the plasma. In order to
proceed we split the Slater sum into a bound part and a free part. This splitting is
not unique. We use here the so - called Brillouin - Planck - Larkin (BPL) convention.
This way of division free - bound corresponds to a smooth cut - oﬀ of the partition
function which is based on omitting of the divergent elements in the sum. This leads
to [1]

where the sum extends only over all the discrete states. It is well known, that the
BPL - convention leads to the simplest expressions for the thermodynamic functions.

In this way we arrive at an eﬀective interaction potential of the free particles u∗

For the electron - electron and for the ion - ion interaction the classical limit gives
simply the Boltzmann factors, i.e. u∗
ii = e2/r. For the electron - ion pairs one
has to perform the classical limit in eq.(5). Explicitly one ﬁnds for the classical limit

2.2 Momentum - Dependent Eﬀective Interactions

As mentioned already above, a principal disadvantage of purely space-dependent po-
tentials is the incorrect representation of the momentum - distributions of the plasma.
In order to achieve a correct representation of the Fermi distribution for the momenta,
momentum-dependent potentials have to be included [23, 25, 27]. In what follows we
will assume a quasi-classical Hamiltonian of the following structure:

H =

Here rij is the usual distance in the coordinate space and pij the distance in the

momentum space. Further we deﬁne the characteristic parameters

ij0 = r2
r2

i0 + r2
j0;

ij0 = p2
p2

i0 + p2
j0;

pi0 = ¯h/ri0

,

where ri0 is a characteristic length (i.e., the radius of the wavepacket) of the par-
ticle i. We have in the Hamiltonian two kinds of particle interaction: the so-called
Pauli-potential VP acting only between identical particles and a Coulomb interaction
modiﬁed by a certain function F (x, y). In order to derive eﬀective expressions of this
type the Hamilton operator ˆH is averaged with respect to test wave functions [25],

H(q, p; ¯h) =

dxψ∗

o(x) ˆHψo(x)

.

Z

This deﬁnition of an eﬀective Hamiltonian stems from the so-called wave-packet dy-
namics. In the last time it has found several applications to plasmas [25, 26, 29, 30].
If one chooses for the test wave functions symmetrized and anti-symmetrized combi-
nations of minimum uncertainty wave packets for the particles of species k,

The averaging over wave functions leads also to a modiﬁed Coulomb interactions,

described by the function F (eq. 8). We obtain

F (x, y) = erf(x)

.

(14)

This potential was obtained already by Klakow et al. [25], it represents the elec-
trostatic energy between two charges which are Gauss-distributed. The free potential
parameter r0 was ﬁtted in such a way, that the properties of an electron gas without
interactions as the binary correlation function and the Fermi momentum distribution
are well reproduced. We assume that the momentum uncertainty is given by that of
the free Fermi gas. In this way we get

and ri0 = ¯h/pi0, where ǫ(i)

the free parameters of the Pauli-potential [23].

kin is the mean kinetic energy of the free Fermi gas of
i0 = mikT ; rii0 =

i0 = ¯h2/2mikT = λ2

3 Quantumstatistical Theory and Simulations

3.1 Thermodynamic Properties

Quantum corrections to the classical electron gas were derived in earlier work [10, 27].
Generalizing the methods developed earlier [27] to the case of the TCP we assume
that the interaction part of the free energy density of the plasma can be split into a
classical and a quantum-mechanical part

fint = fcl + fqu

,

(16)

where fcl is the known free energy density of the classical plasma of free charges
and fqu is the diﬀerence between the full and the classical free energy density. Explicit
calculations for the classical free energy of the electron gas were given ﬁrst by Ab´e
for the low density case and extended by Cohen and Murphy [8]. For a symmetrical
classical TCP it was shown that (with the BPL convention) the ﬁrst correction beyond
the Debye term in the density expansion of the free energy vanishes. [5].
Consider now the quantum-mechanical corrections to the classical free energy density.
For the plasma of free charges this expression is convergent. In the low density limit
we get

fqu =

kT

ninjδBij(T )

.

(17)

−

X

6

Here δBij(T ) is the diﬀerence between the quantum and the classical second virial
coeﬃcients. This function can be calculated exactly by using methods of quantum
scattering theory [15]. First the two particle trace is transformed to a contour integral
over the resolvent of the Coulomb scattering problem. For a mass-symmetrical TCP
all terms except to one cancel and we get (neglecting exponentially small degeneracy
eﬀects) the rather simple result

fqu =

π3/2nineλ3

ieξ2

ie + O(n3/2)

−

(18)

If the masses are not symmetrical, inﬁnite series in the ξ - parameter appear, the so -
called quantum virial functions Q and E [1, 6]. The theory may be extended to higher
concentration by using the method of Pad´e - approximations [7].

·

We carried out extensive simulations for the electron gas [27] and also a few simu-
lations for the symmetrical TCP by using the eﬀective Hamiltonian described above.
Since our modiﬁed Coulomb interaction diﬀers from the bare Coulomb interaction only
for short distances the Ewald sum technique for handling the long range part could
be used. To study equilibrium properties, as e.g. the average energy we carried out
106 steps for ensembles of 64-512 particles. The results
several Monte Carlo runs of 2
were extrapolated to inﬁnite particle numbers. The regions of degenerate and nonde-
generate plasmas were investigated. The results of our simulations were discussed in
detail in earlier work [27, 28]. As the main result we may quote, that at all densities
the deviations from the classical calculations are very small [28]. Further we may
state that the overall agreement between the analytical formulae and the simulations
is rather good. The deviations are all within the error bars of the simulations. Only
at low temperature a systematic deviation is observed, here the semi - classical model
does not work. At conditions of weak or moderate degeneracy our model yields quite
reasonable results.

3.2 Collective Excitations

In order to study collective nonequilibrium eﬀects we simulated a system of 250 elec-
trons with periodic boundary conditions by Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations.
Usually MD simulations consist of two parts: First the desired temperature is ad-
justed using some thermostat, while in a second phase the energy is kept constant
and measurements are performed. Since most known thermostats do not work in the
case of momentum dependent interactions we replaced the equilibration phase by a
MC simulation using the Metropolis Algorithm. This Algorithm is independent from
any particular form of the interaction. To perform the MD simulations we used a 4th
order Runge-Kutta integrator with stepsize control. The runs were of length of order
1000 times the inverse plasma frequency.

First the individual motion of the electrons was studied by calculating the velocity
autocorrelation function < v(t + τ )v(t) >t [27, 30]. It was shown that for moderate

7

coupling (Γ = 1) the velocity autocorrelation falls monotonically to zero , whereas
for the case of strong coupling (Γ = 100) the velocity acf shows oscillations with a
frequency close to the plasma frequency.

To describe the collective behavior of the system we have investigated the dynamic

structure factor of the electron system,

eiωt < ρ(~k, t) ρ(

i~k~ri) is the Fourier component of the microscopic electron
where ρ(~k, t) =
density. We obtained the dynamic structure factor from the MD simulations by ap-
proximating the Heisenberg operator ~ri(t) by the position of the i-th particle in the
simulations. However, the thus obtained quantity (we denote it by R(~k, ω)) is symmet-
ric with respect to the frequency. It corresponds therefore to a classical ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem,

(19)

−

P

,

R(~k, ω) = (nπφ(k)βω)−1 Im ε−1(~k, ω)

.

(20)

where ε(~k, ω) is the dielectric function of the electron OCP. It can be seen from Eq.
(20) that R(~k, ω) cannot be regarded as a structure factor, but as a normalized loss
function. In what follows we will discuss the normalized loss function. Notice, that in
the classical case the loss function and the dynamic structure factor coincide.

We have plotted the loss function R(q, ω) (q = ka) for various q values, for the
case of moderate coupling (Γ = 1), strong coupling (Γ = 10 ) and for the case of very
strong coupling (Γ = 100 ) and for diﬀerent parameters of degeneracy θ = 1 (moderate
degenerate) and θ = 50 (classical plasma) (Figs. 1-6). For the regime of moderate
coupling we have compared the results of the simulations with the corresponding data
from the Random Phase approximation (RPA), [30]. We see from Figs. 1, 2 that
in the case of a moderate coupled plasma (Γ = 1) the shape of the loss function
calculated from the simulations is damped stronger and slightly shifted to the left in
comparison with the RPA loss function. For moderate coupling and in both cases
(weakly degenerate and classical plasma) the plasmon peak can be observed only for
the smallest q value (q=0.619). From Figs 1 and 2 it can be also seen that the change
of the degeneracy parameter θ in the range from 50 to 1 has only a small inﬂuence on
the results.

However, at higher degrees of degeneracy (θ = 0.15) the plasmon peak obtained
from the MD datas is shifted towards higher frequencies. But the peak position in this
case diﬀers quite signiﬁcantly from those predicted by the RPA which is shifted much
more due to the increase of the average velocity (the Fermi velocity) which leads to a
strong positive dispersion (Fig. 3). The simulations underestimate this shift.

In the strong coupling regime (Γ = 10) and for a moderate degenerate plasma
(θ = 1) we observed at the smallest q value a sharp plasmon peak centered near ωP
(Fig. 4). With the increasing wavevector the plasmon peak widens, a plasmon peak

8

can be observed up to q = 1.856. At still higher q values the peak vanishes. Notice
also that within the resolution limited by the simulations almost no dispersion could
be observed at this thermodynamic conditions. We interpretate this as the limiting
region from positive (at smaller Γ) to negative dispersion (at higher Γ).

In the case of very strong coupling Γ = 100 an extremely sharp plasmon peak
centered near ωP can be observed at the smallest q value (Figs. 5, 6). Here the
plasmon peak can be observed up to q = 3.094. For both the case of a classical plasma
(θ = 50) and for the case of moderate degenerate plasma (θ = 1) a negative dispersion
is seen (with increasing wavenumber the peak position is shifted more and more to the
left). This behavior contradicts to the RPA where no plasmon peak is predicted in
this regime due to the strong Landau damping . However, the RPA cannot be applied
to the strong coupling regime. On the contrary, the results of our simulations for the
case of a weakly degenerate plasma (θ = 50) are in a good agreement with the results
for the classical one component
of corresponding MD simulations of Hansen et al.
plasma [13]. From Figs. 5 and 6 one also sees that the negative dispersion is more
pronounced in the case of a classical plasma.

Further we have compared the results of our simulations with the expression of
the dynamic structure factor obtained by the application of the classical theory of
moments which is appropriate also for the case of strong coupling [31]. A more detailed
discussion can be found elsewhere [30]. Here we show the results for two diﬀerent q
vectors at Γ = 100 (Figs.7, 8 [30]). The agreement of the loss functions calculated
by the application of the theory of moments (sum rules approach) with that from the
MD calculations is rather good. The theoretical curves reproduce the varying shape of
the dynamic structure factor and describe the plasmon peak position in a satisfactory
manner. However, the agreement in the height of the peaks is less satisfactory .

Thus we can conclude that due to the quasi-classical character our quantum molec-
ular dynamic simulations describe the collective excitations of the electron gas only
approximately. Our model yields quite reasonable results at weak and moderate de-
generacy, whereas for the case of high degeneracy it seems to break down.

4 Discussion

We developed here a simple quasi-classical model of quantum plasmas based on a dy-
namics with an eﬀective momentum-dependent Hamiltonian. The quantum-mechanical
eﬀects corresponding to the Pauli and the Heisenberg principle were modeled by con-
straints in the Hamiltonian. By using the concept of minimum uncertainty wave pack-
ets, momentum-dependent eﬀective potentials were derived. The eﬀective potentials
were used to simulate one-component plasmas and mass -symmetrical two - compo-
nent plasmas by means of MC and MD methods. The result of the simulations is in
good agreement with analytical calculations of the thermodynamic properties in the
region of small degeneracy and moderate coupling.

9

MD studies provide also informations on the dynamical properties of the plasma,
in particular on collective excitations. As a basis to study these eﬀects we calculated
the structure factor of the plasma. The agreement between the simulations and the
analytical theory based on RPA, sum rules and the theory of moments is reasonable.
In most cases the shape and the location of the plasmon peak is reproduced in a rea-
sonable way, in some cases larger deviations are observed. We cannot expect however,
that the present model, which was obtained by ﬁtting the potential to equilibrium
properties will describe all non-equilibrium properties in a quantitative way. Further
improvements of the model might be unavoidable. We may hope however that at least
near to equilibrium some realistic features are still reﬂected by the model.

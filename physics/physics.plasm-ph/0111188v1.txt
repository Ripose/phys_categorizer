The reconnection rate is obtained for the simplest case of 2D symmetric reconnection in an
incompressible plasma. In the short note (Erkaev et al.1), the reconnection rate is found by matching
the outer Petschek solution and the inner diﬀusion region solution. Here the details of the numerical
simulation of the diﬀusion region are presented and the asymptotic procedure which is used for
deriving the reconnection rate is described. The reconnection rate is obtained as a decreasing
function of the diﬀusion region length. For a suﬃciently large diﬀusion region scale, the reconnection
rate becomes close to that obtained in the Sweet–Parker solution with the inverse square root
dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number Rem, determined for the global size of the current
sheet. On the other hand, for a small diﬀusion region length scale, the reconnection rate turns out
to be very similar to that obtained in the Petschek model with a logarithmic dependence on the
magnetic Reynolds number Rem. This means that the Petschek regime seems to be possible only in
the case of a strongly localized conductivity corresponding to a small scale of the diﬀusion region.

I. INTRODUCTION

Magnetic reconnection is a physical process in plasmas which changes a magnetic ﬁeld topology and releases stored
magnetic energy. It is one of the central concerns in astrophysical, solar, space, fusion and laboratory plasmas (e.g.,
Hones2; Priest3).

A key question arising in the reconnection theory is that of the reconnection rate. So far there are two diﬀerent
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of reconnection based on the Sweet–Parker (pure diﬀusion) (see Parker4;
Sweet5) and the Petschek (slow shock energy conversion) (see Petschek6) approaches. These models propose two
1/√Rem, and the Petschek
diﬀerent estimations of the reconnection rate ε: The Sweet–Parker model predicts ε
model gives ε

1/lnRem, where

is the global magnetic Reynolds number based on the half–length of a current layer L, the Alfv´en velocity VA, and
the resistivity of the plasma η. For cosmic plasmas, magnetic Reynolds numbers usually are very large, therefore the
Petschek regime seems to be much more eﬀective. However, since the Petschek reconnection model was proposed, it
is not clear what conditions are necessary to realize this regime.

It is a fact that numerical simulations (Biskamp7; Scholer8) carried out for a constant resistivity were not able to
reproduce the solution of Petschek type, instead, they were rather in favour of the Sweet–Parker solution. Laboratory
experiments also seem to observe the Sweet–Parker regime of reconnection (Ji et al.9).

On the other hand, if nonuniform resistivity is localized to a small region, the results of numerical simulations
(Scholer8; Ugai10) clearly show Petschek–type reconnection with pronounced slow shocks. For the Petschek regime,
there are two physically diﬀerent regions: A small diﬀusion region, where dissipation is important, is surrounded by a
large convective zone where the plasma can be considered as ideal and dissipationless. The problem is very complicated
and thus it does not seem realistic to obtain an analytical solution which is valid for both regions simultaneously.
To simplify this problem, we seek solutions separately, in the diﬀusion region and in the convective zone. For the
later, a solution can be obtained analytically as an asymptotic series with respect to a small reconnection rate. For
the diﬀusion region, it is impossible to ﬁnd an analytical solution, and hence it has to be obtained numerically. In
this semi–analytical approach, we have to combine the numerical solution for the diﬀusion region and the Petschek
analytical solution for the convective region. The latter can be done by diﬀerent methods, which lead to absolutely
identical results for the reconnection rate estimation. The estimation obtained by Erkaev et al.1 is based on asymptotic
matching of the diﬀusion region and convective zone solutions. In our present work, we use another way based on a
regularized convective region solution, which seems to be rather clear and very close to the original Petschek method.

In this paper we give a detailed description of the numerical solution for the diﬀusion region, and derive the estimation
for the reconnection rate.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sections II and III, we start with the steady-state MHD equations and present
the Petschek solution. The diﬀusion region scaling and boundary layer equations are introduced in Section IV. The
numerical algorithm and the results of the calculations are described in Sections V and VI. The reconnection rate
is derived in Section VII, whereas Section VIII is devoted to the summary and discussion. Mathematical details are
described in the Appendix.

In the problem under consideration, the plasma is governed by the resistive steady–state MHD system of equations

where ρ is a mass density, P is the total pressure, P = p + B2/8π, and Rem is the global magnetic Reynolds number
based on the maximal value of the resistivity ηmax.

Outside of the diﬀusion region, in the so–called convection zone, dissipation is not important any longer, and we

.
can use the ideal system of MHD equations in the limit Rem → ∞

In an incompressible plasma the following relations have to be satisﬁed at the shock front

where the subscripts n and t denote components normal and tangential to the shock front.

The Petschek solution, which is valid in the convection region, can be presented as follows (Petschek6, for details see
Vasyliunas11). We use coordinates x, y, which are directed along the current sheet and in the perpendicular direction,
respectively. The solution is completely determined by the following parameters: Quantity L which is the halﬂength
of the current sheet, v0 is the plasma inﬂow velocity, and B0 is the initial magnetic ﬁeld. The solution is presented in
the form of asymptotic series with respect to the small parameter which is known as the reconnection rate

Here E0 is the electric ﬁeld which is constant in the 2D case under consideration, and EA = 1
electric ﬁeld.

Expressions (11-16) are asymptotic solutions with respect to ε (zero and ﬁrst order terms in the inﬂow region and
only zero order term in the outﬂow region) of the ideal MHD system of equations (2-4) and the Rankine–Hugoniot
shock relations (5-9).

Petschek did not obtain a solution in the diﬀusion region, instead, he estimated the maximum reconnection rate as
1/lnRem using some simple physical suggestions. Generally speaking, this implies that the Petschek model gives any
reconnection rate from the Sweet–Parker value 1/√Rem up to 1/lnRem, and for a long time, it was unclear whether
Petschek reconnection faster than Sweet–Parker reconnection is possible. This problem can be solved by combining
the analytical Petschek solution (11-16) and the numerical model of the diﬀusion region.

IV. DIFFUSION REGION SCALING

The next step is to ﬁnd a numerical solution for the diﬀusion region. But ﬁrst we have to obtain the boundary

layer MHD equations suitable for the diﬀusion region.

To this end we renormalize the MHD equations to new scales Bd, VAd, EAd = BdVAd/c, Pd, where all quantities

are supposed to be taken at the upper boundary of the diﬀusion region,

where lη is the characteristic length of the resistivity variation. The diﬀusion region length scale ld (see Figure 1)
obtained from our numerical results (Section VII) is of order of the scale lη.

The convective electric ﬁeld

B/c is zero in the centre of the diﬀusion region x = y = 0 where v = B = 0,
and then increases to the constant value E0 at the boundary of the convection zone. This type of behaviour of the
convective electric ﬁeld is reasonable to be used for the deﬁnition of the size of the diﬀusion region which is one of
the most important parameters of the problem. Namely, the length scale of the diﬀusion region is determined as the
distance between the origin x = 0, y = 0 and the boundary where the convective electric ﬁeld reaches its asymptotic
value E0, or better to say, some level, for example, 0.9E0.

solution for the diﬀusion region.

where ˜η(˜x, ˜y) is the normalized resistivity of the plasma with the maximum value to be 1, µ is a small parameter,
µ = 1/Re′
d. The small terms which include µ at the right sides of the induction equations are necessary for numerical
stability of the calculations.

It can be seen from equation (22) that the total pressure is constant across the diﬀusion region. This is a general
feature of a boundary layer approximation. Hence, the total pressure is deﬁned inside the diﬀusion region by values
at the boundary, and for the boundary layer equations (21–26), the total pressure can be considered to be a given
function of x, e.g., ˜P (˜x).

As it was pointed out, the appropriate exact solutions of the boundary layer equations (21–26) are unknown even in
the steady–state case, therefore, we have to solve the problem numerically. Although we have to obtain a steady–state
solution, from the point of view of simulation, it is advantageous to use a relaxation method and to solve numerically
the unsteady system of the boundary layer MHD equations (21–26).

It is important to note that in the subset of equations (23–25), only two equations are independent. In principle,
we can determine the normal component from the induction equation (24) or from the equation (25) providing the
magnetic ﬂux conservation. From the mathematical point of view, they are equivalent. In our numerical solution,
we use equation (25) to determine the ˜By component in the internal grid points, and the equation (24) is used as a
boundary condition at the lower boundary.

V. NUMERICAL ALGORITHM

Starting with an initial MHD conﬁguration under ﬁxed boundary conditions, we look for the convergence of the
time–dependent solution to a steady state. To avoid additional numerical diﬀusion, we do not use a ﬂux function and
a magnetic potential. The normalized total pressure is chosen to be 1.

The distribution of the resistivity η = ηmax ˜η(x, y) is traditional (Scholer8; Ugai10)

˜η(˜x, ˜y) = de(−sx ˜x

2−sy ˜y

) + f,

(27)

with d + f = 1. Setting d = .95 and f = .05 we can model a case of localized resistivity, for d = 0 and f = 1 the
resistivity is uniform.

As the initial conﬁguration, we choose a current sheet with a linear proﬁle of the magnetic ﬁeld ˜Bx = ˜y, ˜By = 0.

The velocity components are assumed to be equal to zero at the initial moment, ˜Vx = 0, ˜Vy = 0.

×

To solve the MHD system numerically, we use a two step conservative ﬁnite diﬀerence numerical scheme with a
rectangular grid 145
100 in the ﬁrst quadrant. From a time level (n), we calculate the parameters on the next time
level (n + 1) in two steps. In the ﬁrst step (n + 1/2), diﬀusion is switched oﬀ, and we calculate the parameter at the
intermediate points (n + 1/2) using the equations in characteristic form. This is similar to the approach used in the
Godunov method. In the second step, we calculate the parameters at the next time level (n + 1) using the equations
in conservative form and taking into account the diﬀusion terms approximated in implicit form.

The details of the numerical algorithm are the following. The ˜Bx component is found from the x–component of the

The boundary conditions are as follows:

At the upper (inﬂow) boundary, the tangential magnetic ﬁeld component is assumed to be constant, ˜Bx =1 and the
tangential velocity component vanishes ˜Vx = 0.
At the left boundary we have the symmetry conditions, ∂ ˜Bx/∂ ˜x = 0, ˜By = 0, ˜Vx = 0.
At the right boundary we hold free conditions suitable for a uniform ﬂow in the outﬂow region, ∂ ˜By/∂ ˜x = 0,
∂ ˜Vy/∂ ˜x = 0.

At the lower boundary (y = 0) there is the symmetry condition for the tangential magnetic ﬁeld component, ˜Bx = 0,
and the non–ﬂow condition for the normal velocity component, ˜Vy = 0. At this boundary, the normal component of
the magnetic ﬁeld ˜By is obtained from the induction equation (24) on the line y = 0,

The size of the computational domain is chosen to be much larger than the diﬀusion region size ld, and also much
less than the global size L. At the inﬂow boundary we do not ﬁx the normal components of the magnetic ﬁeld and
velocity, and thus we do not impose a reconnection rate and an electric ﬁeld in the diﬀusion region from the very
beginning. The latter has to be found from the numerical solution self–consistently.

On the other hand, for the case of homogeneous resistivity, the system reaches the Sweet–Parker state (see Figure
3), even if the Petschek solution is used as initial conﬁguration (see also Scholer8; Ugai10; Uzdensky and Kulsrud13).
This seems to imply that Petschek–type reconnection is possible only if the resistivity of the plasma is localized to a
small region, whereas for constant resistivity, the Sweet–Parker regime is realized (Erkaev et al.1).

The size of the diﬀusion region layer ld is deﬁned as its length along the x axis where the convective electric ﬁeld at
˜vx ˜By is less in absolute value than some level of the total electric ﬁeld (say 0.9˜ε).
the lower boundary (y = 0) ˜Ec =
For the case of a localized resistivity, ld practically coincides with the scale of the inhomogeneity of the resistivity
lη when the maximum of resistivity is much larger then the background resistivity. Therefore hereafter we consider
ld ∼
For the case of uniform resistivity, the plasma is accelerated very slowly, and there is no obvious deﬁnition for the
scale length of the diﬀusion region. Diﬀusion is important everywhere for the pure Sweet–Parker regime, and for the
Petschek asymptotic solution there is left no room. Therefore, the solution does not converge to the Petschek solution,
not only at the right hand boundary but everywhere. In this case, the solution will depend on the calculation box size
because it does not have any other scale. Hence, the constant resistivity solution can not be matched to the Petschek
solution.

Nevertheless, the Sweet–Parker regime is still important also for the Petschek solution, because in the nearest
vicinity of the reconnection line, where the resistivity can be considered to be constant, the diﬀusion region structure
is similar to the Sweet–Parker case. Besides, and this is even more important, the scaling for the diﬀusion region is
exactly the Sweet–Parker one (19, 20), or, better to say, the Prandtl scaling.

VII. RECONNECTION RATE

To ﬁnd a relationship between the reconnection rate and dissipation we need ﬁrst of all an estimation of magnetic
ﬁeld at the boundary of the diﬀusion region Bd. To this end we can not use the Petschek solution (12) because the Bx
component diverges at the origin Bx → −∞
0. This singularity is a consequence of the fact
that dissipation actually has not been taken into account for the Petschek solution. Formally it follows from the jump
p
at the origin of the By component of the magnetic ﬁeld (16). Dissipation evidently leads to smooth behaviour of the
magnetic ﬁeld in the diﬀusion region, and then no singularities are possible. To illustrate this we consider a model
distribution of the By(x, 0) component with linearly smoothed boundary condition at the interval (
ld, ld) similar to
the original Petschek6 consideration

Now everything is ready to determine the reconnection rate. The electric ﬁeld must be constant in the whole inﬂow

Substituting Bd from equation (39), we determine ﬁnally the following equation for the reconnection rate ε

where the magnetic Reynolds number Red = 4πVAld/(c2ηmax) is based on the global Alfv´en velocity and the half
length of the diﬀusion region ld. The internal reconnection rate ˜ε has to be found from the simulation of the diﬀusion

It is interesting that for the derivation of the ﬁnal result (43, 44) the only value which has been actually used is
the internal reconnection rate ˜ε obtained from the numerical solution, and the asymptotic behaviour (34). The actual
distribution of the By component along the upper boundary of the diﬀusion region does not contribute at all (besides
of the asymptotic behaviour (34)) in zero–order approximation considered above. Of course, from the mathematical
point of view, it is important that the diﬀusion region solution exists and has the Petschek–like asymptotic behaviour
(11–16). Therefore, the asymptotic behaviour (34) plays the key role in the derivation of the reconnection rate and
this question needs to be clariﬁed in more detail.

Equations (43, 44) give the unique reconnection rate for known parameters of the current sheet L, B0, VA, η, ld.
ld. It is clear that for small ld, the Petschek term
Let us ﬁx now the lengths L and start to vary ld assuming lη ∼
becomes large, whereas for big ld, the Sweet–Parker term is dominant. The behavior of the implicit function ε(ld/L)
given by (43) is non monotonic. There exists a length ld corresponding to a maximum value of the reconnection rate.
This maximal reconnection rate is a function of the magnetic Reynolds number given in an implicit form

0.31. Here Rem is the Reynolds number determined for
−
the global scale and the maximal resistivity Rem = 4πVAL/(c2ηmax). This result can be interpreted as follows. In
the case of a large global Reynolds number, for ﬁxed values of the maximum resistivity and the global scale L, the
reconnection rate and the corresponding intensity of energy conversion reach their maxima when the diﬀusion region
length scale and also the conductivity length scale are much smaller than L. This maximum value of the reconnection
rate is a logarithmic function of the global Reynolds number which is similar to that estimated by Petschek. This fact
contradicts to the usual electrotechnical intuition. For example, to get maximum heating from a rheostat (resistor),
we need to switch on the whole length, to increase ld, as oppose to the progress of reconnection. It is a fact that
the energy release in the course of the reconnection process takes place not only in the form of Joule heating in the
diﬀusion region and at the shock fronts, but also in the form of plasma acceleration.

By increasing the conductivity length scale and the corresponding diﬀusion region length scale, the reconnection

rate decreases substantially, becoming more close to that of the Sweet–Parker regime.

We have to emphasize once more that the case of constant resistivity is not described by equation (44), because
there is no clear scale of the diﬀusion region, no clear Petschek–type asymptotic behaviour, and therefore it can not
be matched with the Petschek solution.

The appearance of strongly localized resistivity is often the relevant case in space plasma applications, but for

laboratory experiments, where the size of a device is relatively small, the Petschek regime can hardly be expected.

One of the main diﬃculties of the diﬀusive–like theories of reconnection such as the Sweet–Parker mechanism
(Sweet, 1958, Parker, 1963), and the tearing instability (Galeev et al., 1986) is that the eﬃciency of the process turns
out to be of the order of Re−α
m where usually 0 < α < 1. For example, for the Sweet–Parker regime, α = 1/2.
In cosmic plasmas the magnetic Reynolds number is often very large because of the large scale, high velocity and
high conductivity. Hence, the eﬃciency of pure dissipative processes is rather poor. The Petschek mechanism of fast
reconnection is much more eﬀective due to the logarithmic dependence of the reconnection rate on scale (42). In the
Petschek model, MHD waves play the dominant role and the logarithmic dependence is the contribution of the waves
to the eﬃciency of the process.

In this paper, we studied reconnection for a strongly localized resistivity with a large ratio of the maximal and
background resistivity ( 20). A crucial parameter for the reconnection rate is the diﬀusion region length which is
obtained to be approximately equal to the length scale of the resistivity. An interesting question for future study is
the dependence of the diﬀusion region length as well as the electric ﬁeld on the amplitude of the resistivity variation.

IX. APPENDIX

So, we have to clarify the problem concerning the asymptotic behaviour By(x/ld)

,
estimate the integral, and to prove that the global Petschek solution tends to the local one if we take into account
all necessary terms. Originally, Petschek (1964) considered the reconnection problem using as a small parameter the
reconnection rate ε. He obtained the solution (11-16), taking into account only zero and ﬁrst order terms in the inﬂow
region, and zero order terms in the outﬂow region. But there is the possibility to extend this solution with higher
order terms (Pudovkin and Semenov, 1985). In order to do this we have to present each component of the MHD state
vector U (inﬂow region), ˆU (outﬂow region), S (shock front ) as an asymptotic series with respect to the reconnection
rate ε

2ε′Bd when x/ld → ∞

→

U = U (0) + εU (1) + ε2U (2) + . . .
ˆU = ˆU (0) + ε ˆU (1) + ε2 ˆU (2) + . . .
S = S(0) + εS(1) + ε2S(2) + . . .

The terms of the series (46-48) can be obtained step by step using the MHD equations (2-4) and the shock boundary
conditions (5-9) according to the following scheme,

U (0) 1
⇒

ˆU (0) 2
⇒

S(0) 3
⇒

U (1) 4
⇒

ˆU (1) 5
⇒

S(1) 6
⇒

. . .

Here U (0) is the initial vector, and each next term is determined via solving the reduced MHD system with boundary
condition provided by the previous step.

For example, the original Petschek solution (11-16) corresponds to the ﬁrst three steps of this scheme. The ﬁrst
step is trivial, because no shock front is yet possible. In the next step, the outﬂow region solution of zero order allows
to impose a boundary condition problem for the inﬂow region solution in ﬁrst order, and so on.

Proceeding according to this scheme up to the step 5 , we obtain the following extended Petschek solution.

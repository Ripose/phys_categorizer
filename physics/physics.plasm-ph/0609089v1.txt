It is argued that continuum realisations of distributions of collisionless charged particles should
accommodate a dynamically evolving number of electric currents even if the continuum is composed
of only one species of particle, such as electrons. A model is proposed that self-consistently de-
scribes the interaction of such a continuum and its electromagnetic ﬁeld. It is formulated using a
Lagrangian approach and employs a “folded” ﬂow map to describe the bulk particle motion. An
asymptotic perturbation scheme is developed to analyse ultra-relativistic multi-component current
conﬁgurations. The model is fully relativistic and is formulated over Minkowski spacetime using
intrinsic tensor ﬁeld theory.

INTRODUCTION

Progress in high-energy physics relies on accelerator
designers contemplating charged particle beams of ever
higher energies and intensities. As schemes for acceler-
ating charged particles become more complex and am-
bitious in their aims, it is apparent that some existing
theoretical models are inadequate for a proper under-
standing of new challenges.
In many existing models,
matter is represented using classical point particles and
it is not clear how to unambiguously and consistently
model their electromagnetic interaction.

The nub of the problem is precisely how one should
sensibly formulate the interaction of a classical point
charge with its own electromagnetic ﬁeld. The charge
density of a point particle is singular and must therefore
be handled carefully. Assumptions must be made about
how the singular Coulombic stresses are compensated by
non-electromagnetic stresses when calculating the par-
ticle’s self-force. This issue was addressed by Dirac [1]
nearly 70 years ago and led to the covariant Lorentz-
Dirac equation for the trajectory of a point charge in an
external electromagnetic ﬁeld. However, unlike more fa-
miliar equations of particle mechanics, the Lorentz-Dirac
equation is a third-order ordinary diﬀerential equation
in proper time for the particle’s trajectory and has a
number of unusual properties including self-acceleration
and pre-acceleration. Unless special ﬁnal conditions are
adopted, it predicts that an isolated and free point charge
with non-zero initial velocity will accelerate forever and
if the particle is subjected to a sharp electromagnetic
pulse it will begin to move before the pulse reaches it.
Methods for evading such unpalatable conclusions in-
volve iterating the Lorentz-Dirac equation in powers of
its charge q0. Landau and Lifshitz [2] showed that trun-
cating the resulting series to any ﬁnite order leads to a
second-order evolution equation yielding particle trajec-
tories with more reasonable properties. Although their
argument yields a workable scheme, it is not at all clear
that it may be generalised to a collection of accelerating
high-energy charged particles in close proximity. Neglect-

ing higher-order terms in q0 may be suspect when the
particle number density is suﬃciently high.
In conclu-
sion, a number of ad-hoc choices must be made to obtain
a sensible relativistic equation of motion for a collection
of charged point particles starting from ﬁrst principles.
For a recent account of the issues concerning the deriva-
tion of the Lorentz-Dirac equation see [3].

Many of the above issues are due to the uneasy mar-
riage of ﬁeld and point particle concepts in classical elec-
trodynamics. Classical point particles are a convenient
idealisation and one might argue that quantum theory
must be invoked to yield a palatable answer. However,
the testy relationship between ﬁelds and point parti-
cles resurfaces in quantum electrodynamics where diver-
gences in “bare” quantities must be regulated prior to
renormalisation to obtain physical results.

Given the above complexities and reservations, an al-
ternative approach has recently been developed [3] to
analyse the ultra-relativistic dynamics of a collection of
accelerating charged particles. The attitude adopted
in [3] and the present article is that models of matter
based on classical relativistic ﬁeld theory are more suit-
able for high-energy beam dynamics than those employ-
ing classical point particle notions. The model in [3] em-
ploys a smooth relativistic ﬁeld description of the elec-
tromagnetic and matter content where the total energy
and momentum of the electromagnetic and matter ﬁelds
are conserved. Charged matter is modelled as a 4-vector
ﬁeld on spacetime whose trajectories describe the bulk
particle motion.

The partial diﬀerential equations governing the elec-
tromagnetic and matter ﬁelds in this article are fully
coupled and non-linear. Although exact solutions de-
scribing highly symmetric conﬁgurations can be found,
the system of equations is in general only tractable when
subjected to an approximation scheme. Such a scheme,
based on a covariant asymptotic expansion in a running
parameter ε > 0 around the light-cone, was introduced
in [3] and permits calculation of the detailed dynamics of
ultra-relativistic charged particle beams in external elec-
In principle, one can calculate the
tromagnetic ﬁelds.

ﬁeld quantities to any desired ﬁnite order in ε.

∂x, ∂y and ∂z components of the equation

The present article focuses on some of the issues en-
countered when analysing the model in [3]. Speciﬁcally,
the non-linearities in the ﬁeld equations may lead to solu-
tions whose charge density diverges despite being initially
regular. Sections II and III brieﬂy review the charged
continuum model in [3] and show that diverging solutions
exist satisfying a substantial range of initial conditions.
This behaviour is commonplace in many continuum mod-
els in physics, such as in neutral gas dynamics and ﬂuid
dynamics, and is often ameliorated by including dissipa-
tive processes. Section IV argues that dissipative pro-
cesses will not prevent the formation of multiple currents
in charged beams. Sections V and VI develop and analyse
a continuum model accommodating currents with a dy-
namical number of components and section VII extends
the ultra-relativistic analysis methods introduced in [3]
to multi-component charged currents.

II. SINGLE CURRENT CHARGED CONTINUA

The model discussed in this section and in [3] describes
a collection of accelerating charged particles, with (rest)
mass m0 and charge q0, as a dynamical continuum. The
vector ﬁeld V is the 4-velocity of the continuum on space-
time and its integral curves describe the bulk motion of
the collection of charged particles. The scalar ﬁeld
N
is the particle number density measured by a comoving
observer and ρ = q2
is called the reduced proper
charge density where ǫ0 is the permittivity of the vac-
uum and c is the speed of light in the vacuum. In what
follows, units are chosen in which c = 1.

(3) is a continuum generalisation of the covariant expres-
sion for the Lorentz force on a point charge (the charge
to mass ratio q0/m0 has been absorbed into the deﬁni-
tions of ρ and F ) where the tangent to the point charge’s
proper-time parametrised worldline has been replaced by
V . The charged matter drives the electromagnetic ﬁeld
through (2) and the electromagnetic ﬁeld acts back on
the matter through (3) conserving total energy and mo-
mentum.

Equations (1-4) are well-known in charged plasma
physics and are often said to describe a “cold charged
ﬂuid”. They have found application to accelerator
physics [5] in recent years and have proved useful for
examining the stability of high intensity particle beams.

III. DEVELOPMENT OF SINGULARITIES IN
THE CHARGE DENSITY

In [3] highly symmetric exact solutions to (1-4) describ-
ing “walls of charge” were used to motivate a hierarchy
of ﬁeld equations for modelling ultra-relativistic charged
particle beams. Exact solutions to (1-4) of the form

were sought, where µ∂z is the Newtonian velocity of the
charge distribution as measured by the laboratory ob-
server ∂t. Using (1-5) it follows that

V V is constant along the integral curves of V . There-
∇
fore, the continuum undergoes local hyperbolic motion
and it is straightforward to solve to (6-8) in a comoving
coordinate system (τ, σ) adapted to V , as shown in [3],
where V = ∂τ and z = σ on the initial hypersurface
τ = 0. For charge distributions initially at rest the Ja-
cobian of the transformation between (τ, σ) and (t, z) is
non-degenerate for all τ and σ [3]. Using (6) it follows
that, for all τ > 0, ρ is well-behaved for charge distribu-
tions at rest at τ = 0.

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that more
general initial conditions lead to divergences in the re-
duced proper charge density ρ over ﬁnite time.
In [3]
particular examples of ρ were generated using expressions
for V and
as functions of τ = ˆτ (t, z) and σ = ˆσ(t, z).
For the present purposes it is more convenient to for-
mulate an ordinary diﬀerential equation for ρ along V
and examine properties of its solutions. The integrabil-

IV. DISCUSSION OF CROSSING
TRAJECTORIES IN CHARGED PARTICLE
BEAMS

In ﬂuid and gas dynamics, crossing trajectories are con-
sidered to be a symptom of incomplete physics. All real
ﬂuids and gases are viscous to some extent and trajecto-
ries may cross if their viscosity is neglected. For example,
a compression wave in a hypothetical inviscid ﬂuid may
lead to a velocity ﬁeld with crossing characteristics, i.e.
the velocity becomes multi-valued. In reality this is not
what happens; the velocity remains single-valued and sta-
bilises to form a propagating shock. The ﬂuid on either
side of the shock is essentially inviscid but close to the

shock the second-order spatial derivatives of the velocity
are so large that dissipation can no longer be neglected.
However, it is far from clear that such arguments are
relevant for a charged particle beam, which is physically
very diﬀerent from a normal ﬂuid. Although (1-4) are
often said to describe a “cold charged ﬂuid” [5], this ter-
minology is misleading. Microscopically, a normal ﬂuid is
a complicated system of neutral particles whose interac-
tions are dominated by molecular collisions and possibly
gravity but the dominant inter-particle forces in a beam
of electrons are entirely electromagnetic in origin. At
ﬁrst sight, it seems that all of the necessary physics is
contained in (1-4).

The velocity ﬁeld V is a smoothed out representation of
the particle motion. The fact that the trajectories cross
does not mean that the particles are colliding; it merely
indicates that a smooth ﬁeld representation of the par-
ticles has degenerated. Similarly, the 3-volume number
density of a collection of particles may attain arbitrarily
large values if the particles dynamically arrange them-
selves into planar or linear conﬁgurations.

Nevertheless, the electric ﬁeld induced by V in (1-4) is
inconsistent where trajectories of V cross. Equation (9)
indicates that the electric ﬁeld in any wall-of-charge so-
lution is constant along V . However, during the crossing
the charge distribution “passes through itself” and the
electric ﬁeld has to change. The reason for this is easiest
to appreciate by the following simple analogy. Consider

6

the dynamics of a pair of positive sheet charges that are
permitted to pass through each other. The sheets are
arranged so that their normals and their electric ﬁelds lie
along the z-axis. Each sheet has the same properties; its
self-induced electric ﬁeld is E at all points to its right and
E at all points its left, where E > 0 is constant, and its
−
charge per unit area is Q = 2ǫ0E. The sheets are labelled
1 and 2 and sheet 1 lies to the left of sheet 2 initially. The
electrostatic force acting on each sheet is constant and is
due to the electric ﬁeld of the other sheet. The force per
unit area acting on sheet 1 is
QE and on sheet 2 is QE.
Thus, the sheets will repel each other but their electric
forces will not be enough to stop them meeting for suf-
ﬁciently large opposing initial velocities. Let the initial
velocities be so large that the sheets pass through each
other. At all times before they meet, the force on sheet 1
is
QE and the force on sheet 2 is QE. After they meet
their rˆoles have been exchanged; sheet 2 is acted on by
QE while sheet 1 is acted on by QE. Now consider a
−
large number of sheets undergoing collective motions in
which only some of the sheets pass through each other.
A continuum realisation of this model is a dynamical set
of component continua each with its own velocity ﬁeld.
The number of components evolves in time and depends
on the history of the total continuum.

−

−

The spacetime ﬁelds (V, ρ) satisfying (1-4) oﬀer an Eu-
lerian description of a single component continuum. Al-
though a dynamical number of components can be simu-
lated using more complicated Eulerian ﬁeld theories [6],
such approaches are restrictive because an upper bound
must be placed on the number of anticipated compo-
nents. In the following section a new Lagrangian model
of a multi-component charged continuum is proposed in
which the number of components is dynamical and free
to attain any value. The essential idea is to describe the
bulk particle motion using a ﬂow map C from a body-
time manifold into spacetime rather than inducing the
motion from a velocity ﬁeld V on spacetime. C may
be described as “folding” a single electric current on the
body-time manifold to give a multi-component current
on spacetime.

V. LAGRANGIAN DESCRIPTION OF

Ingredients in the following Lagrangian description are

B4 = R

g( ˙C, ˙C) =

where ˙C(P ) = (C∗∂λ)(P ) is a vector at p = C(P ) in

M4.
In general, C is a many-to-one map, i.e. there exists
B4 such that C(P1) = C(P2), and C is
P1 and P2 in
not required to be surjective. For any point p
∈ M4
there may exist any number N (p) of real roots of the
equation p = C(P ). The map C describes “multi-valued
velocities” because although C(P1) = C(P2), there is no
˙C(P2). Thus, in general
reason why ˙C(P1) should equal
˙C cannot be identiﬁed with a vector ﬁeld on
M4. The
B4 and ˙C(P ) is a vector at the point
domain of
C(P ); the map ˙C is referred to as a vector ﬁeld over C.
The map C is deﬁned to satisfy the Lorentz force equa-

VI. MULTI-COMPONENT CHARGE
CONFIGURATIONS

Since (1-4) are equivalent to (43-46) when applied to a
spacetime region with a single partial current, it follows
that solutions to (1-4) and (43-46) agree in such a region.
This is illustrated in ﬁgures 3 and 4 by collapsing “wall
of charge” solutions to (1-4) and (43-46). The ans¨atze
for F and V are

Regions of spacetime with diﬀerent numbers of par-
tial currents are distinguished by examining the pull-back
C∗(⋆1) of the spacetime volume 4-form ⋆1 by C. Critical
points in
B4 are deﬁned by the vanishing of the 4-form
C∗(⋆1). Their images under C are also said to be critical
and lie in the interfaces between spacetime regions with
diﬀerent N (p). Specifying a non-vanishing closed 3-form

with analogous initial conditions on C and ̺.

In both cases a critical point develops at pcrit =
(0, 1.075). The integral curves of V in the single-
component Eulerian model (1-4) exhibit crossings along
a narrow corridor inside the forward light-cone of pcrit
(see ﬁgure 3). However, the solution to (43-46) shown in
ﬁgure 4 contains a “fan” of three partial currents inside
pcrit’s forward light-cone. The two models clearly yield
dramatically diﬀerent results.

On the other hand, the two models agree outside the
forward light-cone at pcrit. An argument for this is as
follows:
Integrate (1-4) and (43-46) using a time slic-
ing adapted to a ﬁeld of synchronised inertial observers

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

moving along the z-axis in the laboratory frame with
positive constant velocity arbitrarily close to the speed
of light. As before, the solutions agree up to a constant
proper time surface containing the point pcrit. Part of
this proper time hypersurface almost coincides with the
z > 0 subset of pcrit’s forward light cone. Now integrate
the equations using a time-slicing adapted to a ﬁeld of
synchronised inertial observers moving along the z-axis
in the negative direction at almost the speed of light. The
result agrees almost up to the z < 0 subset of pcrit’s for-
ward light-cone. It follows that the solutions to (1-4) and
(43-46) agree at points outside the forward light-cone at
pcrit.

For further comparison the reduced proper charge den-
sities for (1-4) and (43-46) are shown in ﬁgures 5 and 6.

current whereas the region inside the “fan” contains three
partial currents.

by equating orders in ε lead to a self-consistent hierar-
chical method for approximating solutions to (1-4). The
virtue of the scheme is that the ε dependences conspire to
produce an inﬁnite tower of equations that are partially
coupled and are generally easier to solve than the fully
coupled system (1-4).

A similar approach based on (43-46) will now be out-

Continuum models of charged particle beams include
the interaction of matter with its own electromagnetic
ﬁeld and avoid peculiar phenomena evident in point-
particle descriptions of self-interacting charge, such as
self-acceleration and pre-acceleration. A ﬁeld-theoretic
realisation of a collection of classical electrons is the
“cold” charged continuum. It was shown that the veloc-
ity ﬁeld of the continuum may possess crossing trajecto-
ries and in this case the Eulerian theory is inconsistent.
Such behaviour is not uncommon in physics; compres-
sion waves in inviscid ﬂuids also develop crossing trajec-
tories. However, inviscid ﬂuids are an idealisation; all

11

normal ﬂuids are viscous to some extent and ameliorate
the problem by forming a shock. On the other hand, a
beam of electrons is very diﬀerent from a normal ﬂuid
and it was argued that there is no physical reason why
the trajectories modelling an electron beam cannot cross.
A Lagrangian theory permitting crossing trajectories was
presented and its “wall of charge” solutions were exam-
ined and compared with solutions to the original Eulerian
ﬁeld system. Finally, an approximation scheme was de-
veloped to analyse ultra-relativistic charge conﬁgurations
of the Lagrangian system.

The Lagrangian theory discussed here features an N -
component electric current where N is dynamically de-
termined and has a point-wise dependence on spacetime.
It is possible that conﬁgurations with N = 1 initially
may evolve into highly complicated “turbulent” conﬁgu-
rations where N is arbitrarily large. Further work in this
context may be found in [7].

The theory developed here has immediate application
to high-energy accelerator physics where ultra-relativistic
motion is ubiquitous. The general approach is also valid
in systems where electromagnetic interactions dominate
over collisional processes, such as in laser-driven plasma
wakeﬁeld accelerators where the transition between
single and multiple component electron currents (“wave
breaking”) [8] has recently received much attention.

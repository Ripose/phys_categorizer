A three-wave Budden model with two resonance layers is constructed that allows recirculation of
energy ﬂuxes along a quadrangle in ray phase space. The transmission, reﬂection, and conversion
coeﬃcients for this extended Budden problem are calculated by ray phase-space methods and the
modular-eikonal approach. Analytical and numerical results show that all coeﬃcients exhibit inter-
ference eﬀects that depend on an interference phase calculated from the coupling constants and the
area enclosed by the quadrangle.

The process of mode conversion, involving the interac-
tion between two distinct waves propagating in a mag-
netized plasma, represents an important mechanism by
which heating and current drive by radio frequency may
lead to a burning plasma. In a standard single-crossing
mode-conversion scenario (see conversion region a in
Fig. 1), an incident ray from a primary (x-propagating)
wave propagates on its dispersion surface until it crosses
transversely the dispersion surface of a secondary (k-
propagating) wave. Mode conversion occurs when some
of the energy ﬂux associated with the primary wave is
converted to energy ﬂux for the secondary wave, which
allows a secondary-wave ray to propagate away from the
conversion region. The remaining energy ﬂux associated
with the primary wave is transmitted across the conver-
sion region and allows a primary-wave ray to propagate
away from the conversion region. The conservation of en-
ergy (ﬂux) dictates that the sum of the outgoing energy
ﬂuxes is equal to the incoming energy ﬂux.

The classic Budden problem is a double-conversion
process in ray phase space [1] (see conversion regions b
and c in Fig. 1), whereby a primary incoming wave is
converted to a secondary wave at a ﬁrst conversion re-
gion (b), which then propagates to a second conversion
region (c) where it is converted to an outgoing (reﬂected)
primary wave. Using ray phase-space methods and the
modular-eikonal approach [2], we extend the standard
Budden problem by adding a second double-conversion
process (see conversion regions a and d in Fig. 1), and
a second resonance layer, associated with a third wave
possibly supported by an energetic-particle population
in an inhomogeneous magnetized plasma. The extended
three-wave Budden problem introduces the possibility of
a leaky cavity being created in ray phase space that al-
lows recirculation of energy ﬂuxes.

The modular-eikonal analysis of energy-ﬂux recircula-

tion around a leaky phase-space cavity in ray phase space
was ﬁrst performed by Brizard et al. [3, 4], who consid-
ered the linear interaction between two waves with dis-
persion curves modeled by intersecting parabolas. In this
earlier work, the modular-eikonal approach was success-
fully applied to the double-crossing mode conversion pro-
cess whereby a ray of one wave punctured the dispersion
surface of another wave twice due to ray curvature (corre-
sponding to the case of a near-tangential crossing). The
ray phase-space analysis revealed the existence of four
mode-conversion scenarios based on whether the wave en-
ergies had equal or opposite signs, and whether the wave
rays were co-propagating or counter-propagating in ray
phase space (i.e., whether the signs of dk/dt were equal
or opposite). While all four scenarios yielded transmis-
sion and conversion coeﬃcients exhibiting interference ef-
fects associated with the area enclosed by the intersecting
parabolas and the strength of the coupling constants at
the two conversion points, only two scenarios involved
recirculation of energy ﬂuxes.

The present work considers a modiﬁcation of the three-
wave Budden problem studied by Liang et al.
[2], who
considered the mode conversion in two-dimensional ray
phase space (x, k) between an x-propagating wave with
two positive-energy waves that are co-propagating along
the k-axis. The extended three-wave Budden problems,
considered here and in Ref. [2], introduce four conversion
regions (a, b, c, d) (instead of two for the classic Budden
problem) that form the vertices of a quadrangle in ray
phase space produced by the pair-wise intersections of 4
uncoupled rays associated with three waves (see Fig. 1).
The modular-eikonal analysis of Liang et al. [2] showed
that the reﬂection coeﬃcient and one of the conversion
coeﬃcients exhibited interference eﬀects that depended
on the area enclosed by the quadrangle and the strength
of the coupling constants at the four vertices. In addition,

which generalizes the standard Budden equation by con-
sidering two distinct resonance layers (at x = ± σ) in-
stead of a single resonance. A similar extension of the
standard Budden problem associated with the presence
of sheared ﬂows in magnetized plasmas leads to three
resonance layers and a phase-space cavity [5].

outgoing down-propagating ray B− carries the converted en-
ergy ﬂux C− (below conversion region a). Conservation of
energy ﬂux requires that T + C+ + C− + R = 1.

Liang et al. [2] obtained excellent agreement between di-
rect numerical integration of the coupled-wave equations
and analytical results, thus conﬁrming the validity of the
modular-eikonal approach.

The purpose of the present paper is to use the modular-
eikonal approach to study the extended three-wave Bud-
den problem in which two counter-propagating positive-
energy waves are each interacting linearly with an x-
propagating wave. This scenario allows us to investigate
the validity of the modular-eikonal approach when energy
ﬂuxes are allowed to recirculate around a quadrangle in
ray phase space.

(the latter value corresponds to the
and |η+| = |η
strongest interference eﬀects observed in Fig. 2), where
excellent agreement is found between numerical results
and the analytical conversion coeﬃcients (10) and (12).
The value of the conversion coeﬃcient CB correspond-
ing to the standard Budden problem (with η
= 0) is
also shown and it is clearly seen that the presence of the
third (counter-propagating) wave reduces the conversion
to the bulk-ion wave, i.e., C+ < CB. We note that the
modular-eikonal analysis [2, 3] is valid only when the
area (approximately 4 k0σ) enclosed by the quadrangle
in Fig. 1 is large enough compared to 2π (i.e., the sepa-
ration σ is large compared to the wavelength).

We conclude that the presence of an energetic-particle
population may interfere with RF heating and current-
drive processes in high-temperature magnetized plas-
mas. The simple one-dimensional model presented here
for an extended Budden problem involving three cou-
pled positive-energy waves demonstrates these interfer-
ence eﬀects and our numerical analysis validates the use
of the modular-eikonal approach. The co-propagating
and counter-propagating scenarios associated with a
negative-energy wave [3, 4] supported by an inverted pop-

ulation of energetic-particles allow τ
1 and yield negative conversion coeﬃcients C
−
, which
can be expected to give bulk-ion conversion coeﬃcients
C+ that could exceed unity even as the conservation law
(13) is preserved. We will investigate this potentially
new alpha-channeling process, as well as develop more
realistic models, in future work.

We note that all interference eﬀects disappear when
the order of the two counter-propagating waves in Fig. 1
is reversed (i.e., we assign negative values to the sep-

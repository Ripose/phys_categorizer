We report experimental evidence of electrostatic inhibition of fast electrons, generated in a highly
resistive material upon irradiation with an intense ultra-short (1016 W/cm2, 100 f msec) laser pulse.
The experiment involves measurement of temporal evolution of self-generated magnetic pulses using
pump-probe polarimetry. A comparison is made between the temporal behaviour of magnetic pulses
generated with Aluminum and Glass targets.
It is found that in contrast to Aluminium, self-
generated magnetic pulse decays much faster in glass. This is attributed to the absence of return
shielding currents in glass, which results in build up of electrostatic ﬁeld, which in turn inhibits the
movement of fast electrons. Fitting of experimental measurements using a one dimensional model,
yields estimate of conductivity of Aluminium and glass, and penetration depth of hot electrons in
these materials.

Interaction of intense ultrashort laser pulses with a
solid leads to generation of large magnetic ﬁelds. Mag-
netic ﬁelds up to gigagauss magnitudes have been pre-
dicted in the overdense region of solid density plasmas
[1, 2], which are created by explosive ionzation of a solid
target by an incident laser. Fields comparable to stellar
magnitudes (≥ 300 MG) have already been experimen-
tally realized in the laboratory with the use of super-
intense ultra-short laser pulses [3]. Recent studies have
also established the ultrashort duration (∼ picosec.) of
these self-generated magnetic ﬁelds under femtosecond
laser excitation [4, 5]. The temporal behaviour of the
magnetic pulse contains crucial information about the
dynamics of hot electron propagation inside a solid den-
sity material / plasma. This information about the pen-
etration and transport of hot electrons [7] inside an over-
dense plasma and factors aﬀecting it, is of utmost im-
portance to the fast ignitor approach of fusion research
[8, 9].

The pulsed high magnetic ﬁelds generated primarily
near the critical density surface, result from a combina-
tion of currents, viz. the direct hot electron current which
is due to copious generation of fast electrons at the criti-
cal layer via collisionless absorption of incident laser en-
ergy , and the return shielding current which is generated
in response to the hot electron current [6]. The propa-
gation of hot electrons inside the solid density target de-
pends on whether the target is a dielectric or a conductor.
In case of a dielectric ( material with high classical resis-
tivity ), the return shielding current is weak, resulting in
a large charge imbalance which in turn exerts a strong
retarding ﬁeld on the fast electrons, resulting in electro-
static inhibition. Electrostatic inhibition of hot electrons
in dense matter has been seen in some experiments by

measuring K α emission from layered targets. In initial
experiments by Bond et. al. [10] inhibition of fast elec-
trons due to resistive electric ﬁeld was observed in low
density gold targets. In contrast to a dielectric, in a con-
ductor ( material with extremely low classical resistivity
), the return shielding current nearly balances the hot
electron current. Here the stopping of hot electrons oc-
curs because of turbulence induced anomalous resistivity,
the chaotic magnetic turbulence eﬀects being generated
by the presence of large gradients in the plasma currents
[12, 13]. Experimental evidence of turbulence induced
anomalous resistivity is presented in a recently published
experiment by Sandhu et. al.
[4], where they irradiate
a solid aluminium target with a high intensity femtosec-
ond laser. Since the mechanism of hot electron transport
( along with return shielding current ) and their eventual
stopping is diﬀerent ( it is either electrostatically induced
[10] or turbulence induced [4] ) in a dielctric and a con-
ductor, it is expected that the temporal evolution of the
magnetic ﬁelds which these currents generate will also be
diﬀerent. Thus the complex dynamics of the hot electron
propagation inside a solid density material ( or plasma )
is reﬂected in the time evolution of the magnetic pulse.

Here we present experimental results on transport of
hot electrons and their inhibition in both high and low re-
sistivity media via measurements on temporal evolution
of megagauss magnetic pulses. Recently, there has been
a lot of experimental work on the transport of hot elec-
trons [11], but to our knowledge no experimental result
exists which gives a clear distinction between electrostat-
ically induced and turbulence induced inhibition of fast
electrons. In our experiment, this has become possible
through the use of temporal measurement of magnetic
pulses which is intimately related to the propagation of

hot electrons inside the material. We compare two en-
tirely diﬀerent media, one conducting (solid Aluminum)
and the other insulating (BK7 Glass). We use pump-
probe polarimetry to measure the ellipticity produced
in a probe laser pulse due to pump-generated magnetic
ﬁelds. This measured ellipticity is then analyzed numer-
ically to deduce the magnetic ﬁeld as a function of time
delay between pump and probe pulses. We ﬁnd that
the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld in aluminium and glass
to be drastically diﬀerent. The time required for the
magnetic ﬁeld to decay in glass is found to be an or-
der of magnitude smaller than in aluminium. This is a
clear indication of electrostatic inhibition of fast electrons
which results from absence of return shielding currents
due to very low electrical conductivity of glass. We also
present an one-dimensional model ( an improvement over
our zero-dimensional model [4] ) for magnetic ﬁeld evo-
lution which gives an interpretation of our observations.
The decay time in each case is related to the electrical
conductivity ( electrostatically induced or turbulence in-
duced ), thus providing us with estimates of conductivity
of glass and aluminium under conditions of elevated tem-
peratures and pressures.

The experimental set-up is shown in ﬁgure 1. The
p-polarized pump laser (100fs, 800nm) is focused at an
angle of 45◦, to an intensity of ∼ 2 × 1016W cm−2 on a
spot size of 20 microns. The long term contrast for the
pump is 105. The probe laser used in measurements is
frequency doubled (400nm) in a thin BBO crystal, and is
made ∼ 103 − 104 times weaker than the pump intensity
and is focused at near normal incidence. In this conﬁgu-

c

ration, the probe penetrates beyond the critical density
(nc) for the pump laser (i.e. upto 4n(806)
), and thus
samples high density region near and beyond the critical
layer, where high magnetic ﬁelds are expected to exist.
It should be noted that this high density region is not
accessible using tangential polarimetric measurements of
Faraday rotation. The input laser ﬂuctuations are moni-
tored with a photodiode (PD1). The reﬂected probe from
the interaction region is split into two arms, one arm is
used in PD2 to measure the reﬂectivity of the probe and
the second arm is used in the quarter wave plate and
polarizer combination ( kept in front of photodiode PD3
) to measure the polarization parameters of the probe.
The reﬂectivity measurement serves to establish the zero
delay and is used to normalize other polarimetric mea-
surements. All the measurements are made as a function
of time delay between pump and probe. Diﬀuse scatter
is also monitored with another PD and is observed to be
insigniﬁcant and constant in our temporal range of inter-
est. In our experiment, we have used two type of targets,
ﬁrst one an aluminium target i.e. a conductor and second
one a glass target i.e. an insulator. The BK7 glass target
was coated with about half a micron thick aluminium on
the front surface so that laser hitting the target generates
identical hot electron temperatures in both cases. To es-
tablish that this is indeed so, we have measured the hard
X-rays arising from hot electrons in the energy range from
50 to 500 keV for both the cases, under similar laser con-
ditions with a NaI(Tl) detector. The hot electron spectra
are shown in ﬁgure 2(a). The hot electron temperature
obtained from the ﬁt (shown as solid line) is observed to
be approximately same (∼ 30keV ) in both the cases (Al
layer on Glass and Al metal alone). This indicates that
we have identical hot electron source in both cases arising
from interaction of the laser pulse with the front surface
of the target. The magnetic ﬁeld induced ellipticity in
the probe pulse is measured using diﬀerent combinations
of quarter wave plate and polarizer in analyzer setup i.e.
polarizer at 0, 45, 90◦ and λ/4 plate at 45◦ and polarizer
at 90◦ [14]. The measurement of stokes parameters in
this method rules out the presence of any random de-
polarization. Experimental curve showing ellipticity vs
time delay is also shown in ﬁgure 2(b). The signiﬁcant
diﬀerence is observed in time scale when we compare the
two cases, that of glass and aluminum. We now numeri-
cally analyze the measured ellipticity in order to deduce
the magnetic ﬁeld present in the interaction region.

An electromagnetic wave travelling through a magne-
tized plasma with wave vector perpendicular to the qua-
sistatic magnetic ﬁeld can be analyzed in terms of two
characteristic modes, the ordinary mode (O-wave) with
electric ﬁeld polarization vector parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld and the extraordinary mode (X-wave) with electric
ﬁeld polarization vector perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld [21]. These two modes have diﬀerent refractive in-

where µO represents refractive index for O-mode and µX
represents refractive index for X-mode. Here ω, ωpe
and ωce are respectively the laser frequency, the elec-
tron plasma frequency, and the electron cyclotron fre-
quency i.e. eB/mc. The diﬀerence in refractive indices
results in accumulation of phase diﬀerence between O-
and X- waves as they propagate through the plasma.
This diﬀerence in phase is observed as induced ellip-
ticity.
If we represent the laser polarization in terms
of stokes vector s = (s1, s2, s3) , s1 = cos(2χ)cos(2ψ),
s2 = cos(2χ)sin(2ψ) , s3 = sin(2χ), where ψ is ori-
entation of polarization ellipse, then the ellipticity ǫ is
given by ǫ = tan(χ). The evolution of stokes vec-
tor inside the magnetized plasma is given by the diﬀer-
ence in refractive indices of the characteristic waves i.e.
ds/dz = Ω(z) × s(z), where Ω = (ω/c)(µO − µX ). The
solution of this polarization evolution equation is writ-
ten as s(z) = M.sinput, where Mij is the transition ma-
trix which obeys the equation dMi/dz = Ω × Mi, where
Mi = (M1i, M2i, M3i) [14]. We integrate this equation

numerically inside the plasma by dividing it into small
slabs, where within each slab, the plasma parameters are
assumed to be constant.

For the purpose of integration, the required plasma
density proﬁle is modelled by assuming that the plasma
expands into vacuum at ion sound speed in a self sim-
ilar fashion [17, 20], which yields an exponential den-
sity proﬁle of the form ne = nsexp(−z/cst), where ns
(ZkTe/mi) is the ion
is the solid density and cs =
sound speed. We have chosen the background electron
temperature Te = 100eV [18] and the average ionization
state Z = 5 [22]. At the vacuum end, which is cho-
sen at a distance Ls from the critical layer, we put a
cut oﬀ on the density ‘nend’ which is chosen suﬃciently
low so that it makes practically no diﬀerence to the re-
sults. The plasma slab to be integrated over is given by
Ls = cst[ln(ncritical/nend)]. It is found that the results
are not sensitive to the chosen density proﬁle; even the
use of linear density proﬁle yields results within accept-
able error bars.
In addition to the density proﬁle, we
have assumed uniform magnetic ﬁeld inside the plasma
column. Although, this assumption is not strictly cor-
rect, it makes little diﬀerence to the results, and is a
reasonable one as shown later. The solution Mij(z), and
s(z) = M.sinput can now be determined for any small
plasma slab ( where the density is assumed to be con-
stant ) for a given value of magnetic ﬁeld B in deﬁnition
of Ω. Thus recursively solving in small steps and main-
taining unitarity of M one can ﬁnd the full transition
matrix for whole plasma column, for any chosen density
proﬁle. From the transition matrix, the ﬁnal stokes vec-
tor can be computed which in turn gives the ellipticity
of the reﬂected probe.

In addition to the phase diﬀerence introduced by dif-
ferences in refractive indices, there is an extra phase dif-
ference which aries due to slightly diﬀerent turning points
for O and X-wave. The X-mode has a turning point i.e.
right cut-oﬀ in the dispersion diagram, earlier than the
O-mode, which reﬂects at usual critical density. This ex-
tra path travelled by O-mode as compared to X-mode
leads to an additional phase diﬀerence, which we have
included in our calculation of net ellipticity. Thus the
eﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld manifests itself in the form of el-
lipticity of the reﬂected probe light by both of the above
mentioned processes i.e. diﬀerence in refractive indices
and diﬀerence in turning points.

Using the above described procedure, for each time de-
lay, we iteratively calculate the magnetic ﬁeld B required
to yield the experimentally observed ellipticity. The ﬁ-

FIG. 3: Magnetic ﬁeld pulse proﬁle for (a) Glass (b) Alu-
minum with laser with intensity of 2 × 1016 Wcm−2. Solid

ical model.

cases are of the same order ( 32M G in case of BK7 glass
and 22M G in case of solid aluminium ). The most strik-
ing diﬀerence between the two cases is seen in the time
durations of the self-generated magnetic pulses (note dif-
ferent time axis of ﬁg 4(a) and (b)). In case of BK7 glass
coated with alumunium, the time duration of the mag-
netic pulse (∼ 1picosec) is an order of magnitude smaller
than the time duration (∼ 10picosec) of the magnetic
pulse for pure aluminium. This is a clear indication of
high background resistivity of glass, which curtails the
return currents and hence results in inhibition of hot elec-
trons because of electrostatic ﬁelds. This leads to much
faster resistivite decay of magnetic ﬁelds in case of glass
sample as compared to solid aluminium sample, where
the decay is mainly due to turbulence induced anoma-
lous resistivity [4].

We now model the temporal evolution of magnetic
ﬁeld using the following equation, which describes the
mechanism of quasistatic magnetic ﬁeld generation un-
der EMHD approximation.

The above equation is derived by taking the curl of the
equation of motion of background plasma electrons that
carry the return shielding currents, ~jp = (c/4π)(∇× ~B)−
~jhot, where ~jp = σ ~E, σ being the conductivity of the
background plasma. The ﬁrst term describes the mag-
netic ﬁeld decay due to resistive damping of the plasma
shielding currents and the second term describes the mag-
netic ﬁeld generation due to hot electron currents. As-

where the diﬀusion term is approximated as B/τ with
τ ≈ (4πσ/c2)(∆r)2, and the source term is approximated
as S(z, t) ≈ −(c/σ(∆r))jhot(z, t). Here ∆r is the laser
spot radius ≈ 10µ. Our main interest lies in understand-
ing the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld after the laser
is switched oﬀ. This is because the experimental results
show that, although the laser is on only for ∼ 100f msec.,
the magnetic ﬁeld peaks and remains on for picoseconds
time duration. Taking B = Blas at t = τlaser, the solu-
tion of equation (4) is given by

tion of equation (6) in this temporal regime, as given in
ref. [15]

now use the above expression for B(t, z) at z = 0 to
model the magnetic ﬁeld evolution as a function of time,
for both BK7 glass coated with aluminium and solid alu-
minium using τ ( which is related to conductivity σ ) and
f ( fraction of light absorbed ) as free parameters. z = 0
is the point where hot electrons are generated; so it is
actually the critical density point. The proportionality
contstant α is taken to be unity. Blas, the magnetic ﬁeld
at time t = τlaser is 15M G and 18M G respectively for
aluminium and glass. The best ﬁt curves ( solid lines )
are shown in ﬁg. 3(a) and ﬁg. 3(b) respectively. From
the best ﬁt, the relevant parameters ( f and τ ) for alu-
minium and glass are:

Aluminum: f = 0.5; τ = 3.5 ps
Glass: f = 0.2; τ = 0.2 ps
Before presenting a discussion of our results obtained
from one-dimensional modelling and numerical ﬁt, we
ﬁrst justify the assumption we have made in our numer-
ical analysis of ellipticity viz. the assumption of uniform
magnetic ﬁeld inside the plasma slab. Fig. 4 shows the
typical magnetic ﬁeld as a function of z and t obtained
from our one-dimensional model. This plot is for alu-
minium with f and τ as calculated above. As expected,
the magnetic ﬁeld diﬀuses in z and decreases in ampli-
tude as time increases. Although the magnetic ﬁeld B
varies with z, we shall see below that its variation is not
signiﬁcant over the range of scale lengths which are rele-
vant for our experiments. In Fig. 5, using equation (12)
we have plotted the magnetic ﬁeld as a function of posi-
tion at a time corresponding to the peak of the magnetic
ﬁeld, for both aluminium and glass. In this plot, we have
used the same value of f and τ as obtained above. This
plot clearly shows that the variation of magnetic ﬁeld
over the plasma slab is negligible. This justiﬁes that the

FIG. 4: (a) The z and t dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld

assumption of uniform magnetic ﬁeld in our analysis of
ellipticity is a reasonable one.

We now discuss our results. From the results of the
ﬁt, it is clear that the time for magnetic ﬁeld decay in
aluminium is an order of magnitude larger than in glass.
Calculation of conductivity using σ = (c2/4π(∆r)2)τ ,
gives σAl = 2.5×1014s−1 and σglass = 1.43×1013s−1. As
of now there are no measurements of conductivity at ele-
vated temperatures for glass and very few in aluminium.
We see that resistivity of aluminium as deduced from
these measurements is an order of magnitude higher than
the value of resistivity deduced from reﬂectivity measure-
ments by Milchberg et. al. [22]. This, we believe, is due
to turbulence induced anomalous resistivity which aﬀects
the return currents. This conclusion is also supported by
simulation where similar eﬀect of anamalous resistivity
and stopping of hot electrons have been seen [6]. In the
case of glass, the situation is more complex as at low
temperatures glass is almost non-conducting (σ ∼ 0).
However, at elevated temperatures, as a result of tar-
get heating by collisional eﬀects and large electric ﬁelds
exceeding breakdown threshold, conductivity becomes ﬁ-
nite. There exists observation of 8µ wide collimated ion-
ization tracks extending upto 150 − 300µ and lasting for
60 ps in glass with a 1017W cm−2 intensity laser [16]. Al-
though we cannot estimate here the amount of target
heating or ionization, we do get an estimate of resitivity,
which we assume to be uniform in space and time. Our
measurements show that neutralization of hot electron
current is clearly not as eﬀective in glass as it is in alu-
minium, due to high background resistivity. This results

in inhibition of hot electron propagation in glass through
generation large of electrostatic ﬁelds. We now make
an estimate of the penetration depth (Lf ) of hot elec-
trons using equation (8). Using the parameters z0 and σ
from the ﬁt and Thot from observations, we get, for glass,
Lf = 4.7 × 10−5cm in 1 ps and 2.1 × 10−4cm in 10ps, and
for aluminium Lf = 1.6 × 10−3cm in 10ps. These num-
bers indicate that hot electrons are penetrating an order
of magnitude more distance in a conducting background.
Similar results on electrostatic inhibition have also been
measured in plastic targets using Kα emission from lay-
ered targets. This technique has its limitations due to its
reliance on x-ray measurements which is a secondary di-
agnostic (with limitations of sensitivity, calibration, and
reabsorption) and on numerical codes for interpreting X-
ray data.

In conclusion, the penetration of fast electrons into a
target can result in very high electric ﬁeld, which is not
quenched by thermal return currents. This can lead to
severe impediment in the ﬂow of fast electron currents.
We provide evidence of inhibition of fast electrons in an
insulating media. Our results on magnetic pulse mea-
surement and modelling in terms of hot electron currents
as source, yield measurements of conductivity of conduct-
ing and dielectric media under extreme conditions. These
results are very important for laser fusion schemes, which
rely on ignition of hot spot by energy deposition by fast
electrons.

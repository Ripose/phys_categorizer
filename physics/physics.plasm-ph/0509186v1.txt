The existence and properties of phase-space structures in current-carrying pair plasmas is

studied by means of the ﬁnite amplitude expressions of the pseudo-potential method. Em-

phasis is given to double layers, solitary structures and periodic waves. The results can be

applied to electron-positron plasmas as well as to plasmas containing heavier charged parti-

cles with the same mass and opposite charges, such as fullerene ions and dust particles. They

can also help to understand numerical simulations that showed the spontaneous formation

of phase-space holes in linearly stable regimes.

INTRODUCTION

The investigation of collective phenomena in pair plasmas, consisting of two species with the

same mass is gaining interest among the plasma physics community. There are several reasons for

that: the ﬁrst one is that electron-positron pair plasmas are present in many astrophysical contexts,

such as the early universe, neutron stars and active galactic nuclei. On the other hand, recent

experiments with fullerene pair plasmas [1] have allowed the investigators to observe collective

phenomena in the laboratory, something that was earlier impeded by the short annihilation times

of electron-positron laboratory plasmas [2, 3, 4]. But another explanation for the outstanding

interest in pair plasmas is their relatively simple theoretical description, which makes them a

particularly good subject of investigations for questions in fundamental plasma theory.

This property of pair plasmas has been emphasized in earlier works that investigated the non-

linear instability and saturation of current-carrying plasmas [5, 6]. In these works, use was made of

the equality of time-scales in the dynamics of both species to accelerate the onset and evolution of

instability in a linearly stable regime. It was also found that, after a turbulent transient stage, the

system reached a stable state in which phase-space structures were present coexisting with distri-

bution functions one of which being characterized by a ﬂat trapped particle distribution. Kinetic

structures in pair plasmas were on the other hand investigated in Refs. [7] and [8], two works on

which the present article relies. However, in the ﬁrst, analytical one the investigations were limited

to small amplitude waves and a complete symmetry in the parameters describing the distribution

functions of both species whereas in the second, numerical one only solitary phase-space holes

were considered. Both works did not consider current-carrying plasmas. It is thus appropiate to

remove these restrictions in order to arrive at a more general theory of electrostatic trapping in

pair plasmas, which is the purpose of the present article.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II we provide a theoretical background about the

governing equations and the procedure to obtain ﬁnite amplitude equilibrium solutions. Sections

III, IV and V are dedicated, respectively, to the study of double layers, phase-space holes and

periodic solutions. Finally, the results and conclusions are summarized in section VI.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

We consider a drifting collisionless pair plasma with equal temperatures for both particle species.

The dynamics is governed by the 1D Vlasov-Poisson system

where n0 is the unperturbed particle density of each species, e is the magnitude of the electron

charge, m is the mass and T is the temperature (in Joules) of the two species in the unperturbed

state. The distribution functions of the homogeneous, unperturbed state are in the center-of-mass

Electrostatic structures in plasmas have been throughly investigated by means of the pseudo-

potential method, ﬁrst introduced in the kinetic regime in Ref. [9] and further developed in Refs. 10,

11, 12 (see also Refs. 13 and 14 for a review). In this method, the distribution functions for equilibria

in the wave frame depend on the constants of motion in a prescribed form, namely

standing DLs while the dashed one stands for propagating DLs with a phase speed v0 = 1. Note that for

both cases two branches exist, called symmetric and asymmetric branches. Note also that there are no

asymmetric solutions in the propagating case if α > 0.55.

III. DOUBLE LAYERS

Now we make use of the expressions presented in the previous section to obtain equilibrium

solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system. First, we look for double layer (DL) solutions. Double

layers are conﬁgurations of phase-space which are associated with a monotonic step-like potentials

[13, 15].

In order to have a DL, the densities of both species must be equal as x

, which means

and N+ = 1/n0(v+, α, Ψ). Under this assumption, the condition n−(Ψ) = n+(Ψ) reduces to

n0(v+, α, Ψ)n0(v−, β, Ψ) = 1.

(6)

This equation has to be solved simultaneously with the NDR for the unknowns u0 and Ψ in order

to obtain valid solutions.

A. Non-drifting plasma

In Ref. [7], the existence of DLs in pair plasmas was discussed. They were limited, however, to

the small amplitude limit and with the further assumption of complete symmetry between positive

and negative particles (α = β). Here we show that, even if we drop such limitations, we can still

Note that for both cases two branches exist, which are the degenerated form of the symmetric and asymmetric

ﬁnd DL solutions. Their existence curves are plotted in Fig. 1. Note that there are two diﬀerent

branches, labelled “symmetric” and “asymmetric”.

The symmetric branch represents solutions for which α = β. It exists only for α < 0 and admits

DLs of arbitrary strength. In the limit Ψ

1.08. This implies that

the DL becomes the stronger the more ﬂat both trapped particle distributions are.

The asymmetric branch, on the other side, represents solutions for which the complete symmetry

between the species is broken. This branch contains also solutions for which α

0. In the special

≥

case α = 0, the distribution function of positive particles is ﬂat in the trapped range while trapped

negative particles form a dip.

The most relevant physical diﬀerence between both branches is that, while solutions in the

symmetric branch do not present a jump in the densities, this is not true for asymmetric solutions.

B. Current-carrying plasma

The picture is changed when we look for double layers in a current-carrying plasma, a case which

was not discussed in Ref. [7]. The parameter curves representing possible solutions for vD = 2 are

shown in Fig. 2.

First of all we note that the expressions for n0(u, β, Φ) and V0(u, β, Φ) do only depend on
u2. Therefore we can make a complete correspondence between standing structures in a current-

carrying plasma (v− = v+ = vD/2) and propagating structures in a non-current-carrying plasma

v− = v+ = v0) just by interchanging vD/2 and

are the same as the dashed ones in Fig. 1. Note however that, although the location of solutions

in parameter space are exactly the same, both represent very diﬀerent kinds of solutions.

Nevertheless, if we look for propagating structures in current-carrying plasmas, the symmetry is

broken and the correspondence is no longer valid. An example of the location in parameter space

of propagating DLs is given by the dashed line in Fig. 2. Note that we still have two diﬀerent

branches but now, as v0

= 0 imposes a further asymmetry, we do not have a family of solutions

with α = β. We can still call the two branches of solutions “degenerated symmetric branch” and

“degenerated asymmetric branch”. The degenerated symmetric branch exists only for α < 0 and

requires increasing amplitudes as α

0. Here we ﬁnd also a power law of the form

IV. SOLITARY PHASE-SPACE HOLES

The existence and properties of solitary holes in non-drifting pair plasmas was already studied

in Ref. [8]. Therefore here we focus on the existence of solitary holes in current-carrying pair

plasmas. As the symmetry arguments mentioned in the past section hold for holes as well as for

DLs, standing holes in a current-carrying plasma correspond one-to-one to propagating holes in a

plasma with vD = 0.

Without loss of generality, we will consider here holes in f−, corresponding to bell-like electro-

static potentials, i.e. V ′(0) = 0, V ′(Ψ) > 0. We will also consider only the case of a ﬂat trapped

range in f+ (α = 0). There are several reasons to give special attention to these cases: a) there are

large numerical evidences that such conﬁgurations are more stable and therefore potential attrac-

tors of the dynamics. For example, in Ref. [16] the evolution of two colliding holes was simulated

which resulted in a partially ﬂat distribution function, and b) recent simulations of nonlinear insta-

V. PERIODIC STRUCTURES

Periodic structures can also appear in pair plasmas. This is important because they are excited

in experiments such as Ref. [1] is usually periodical and also because most numerical codes impose

periodic boundary conditions in space, giving preference to periodic structures.

In Ref. [7] a dispersion relation was found for harmonic waves that smoothly joined the limits

of slow acoustic modes ω/√2

Figure 4 shows the dispersion relation of these waves with diﬀerent values of the amplitude of the

electrostatic potential. There we notice that for large amplitude waves the minimum phase velocity,

corresponding to the slow acoustic mode, is considerably smaller than the one corresponding to

very small amplitudes (v0 = 0.924√2 when Ψ

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we investigated the existence of electrostatic structures in pair plasmas with a drift

between the species due e.g. to an external electric ﬁeld. This results extend and complement those

of Refs.[7] and [8] in several aspects: we do not restrict ourselves to the case of perfect symmetry

between the species (α = β), we do not base the results in the small amplitude limit (Ψ

1) and,

≪

ﬁnally we do not consider only plasmas without a drift velocity between the species (vD = 0). By

removing those limitations we have explored a wide range of possible structures. We have focused

on some remarkable results that may help to interprete future experimental and numerical data.

As relevant outcome, we emphasize the existence of asymmetric double layers, that exhibit a

jump in the densities, as well as the dependence between the velocity of the slow acoustic mode

and the potential amplitude for periodic waves. This latter result can easily be compared with

experimental data extracted from a laboratory setup like that of Ref. [1], something that we propose

here and that would yield interesting results.

We would like also to underline that the results presented here are also connected with the

studies about the nonlinear instability and saturation of pair plasmas, presented elsewhere [5].

The connection is twofold: a) in that reference it was shown that nonlinear stability is triggered

by small amplitude phase-space holes and b) the ﬁnal stable equilibrium is indeed a structured

equilibrium that should be studied with the tools presented here.

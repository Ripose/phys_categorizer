A fully nonlinear, time-asymptotic theory of resonant par-
ticle trapping in large-amplitude quasi-parallel Alfv´en waves
is presented. The eﬀect of trapped particles on the nonlin-
ear dynamics of quasi-stationary Alfv´enic discontinuities and
coherent Alfv´en waves is highly non-trivial and forces to a sig-
niﬁcant departure of the theory from the conventional DNLS
and KNLS equation models. The virial theorem is used to
determine the time-asymptotic distribution function.

The magnetic ﬂuctuations frequently observed in So-
lar Wind and Interstellar Medium plasma have been the
subject of protracted and intense observational and the-
oretical scrutiny. It is likely that these ﬂuctuations are
nonlinear Alfv´en waves, in which the ponderomotive cou-
pling of Alfv´enic magnetic ﬁeld energy to ion-acoustic
quasi-modes has modulated the phase velocity vA, and so
caused steepening and formation of discontinuities [1–3].
Such rotational and directional discontinuities have in-
deed been observed in the Solar Wind, and are proba-
bly quasi-stationary waveform remnants of nonlinearly
evolved Alfv´en waves [4].

Beginning with the work of Cohen and Kulsrud [5],
the theory of quasi-parallel, nonlinear Alfv´en waves has
received a great deal of attention [6] and has spawned
in a variety of modiﬁcations of the wave envelope evo-
lution equation, referred to as the Derivative Nonlinear
Schr¨odinger (DNLS) equation. However, almost all at-
tention has been concentrated on developing and extend-
ing the ﬂuid theory of such waves, leaving issues of par-
ticle kinetics aside. Nevertheless, some attempts to in-
corporate particle dynamics into the DNLS model have
been made, both analytically [7] and (very extensively)
via particle- and hybrid-code simulations [8]. Progress in
constructing an analytical kinetic-MHD model of non-
linear coherent Alfv´en waves occured recently by the
self-consistent inclusion of linear Landau damping [2,3]
and gyro-kinetic (e.g., ion-cyclotron) eﬀects [3]. How-
ever, even in these treatments, wave-particle resonant in-
teraction is treated perturbatively and calculated using
the linear particle propagator. This technique fails for
a large-amplitude wave propagating in a ﬁnite-β plasma
(here β is the ratio of kinetic and magnetic pressure)
because of non-perturbative eﬀects associated with par-

we extend the theory of ‘kinetic’ nonlinear Alfv´en waves
to the strongly nonlinear regime where trapped particles
are important.

action of the plasma with ion-acoustic quasi-modes is a
critical constituent of the wave dynamics. The very exis-
tence of rotational discontinuities is due to the nonlinear
coupling of Alfv´en waves to (linear) Landau dissipation
[1]. Here, linear Landau dissipation refers to damping
calculated perturbatively, assuming a Maxwellian parti-
cle distribution function (PDF), and thus with a time-
independent rate coeﬃcient. This mechanism enters the
Alfv´en wave dynamics nonlinearly (i.e., in proportional to
the magnetic energy density of the wave train) because it
enters a functional with the parallel ponderomotive force
⊥/8π). The ‘kinetic’ wave equation, called the

Obviously, particles which are near resonance with
the wave (v
vA) will be trapped by the ponderomo-
tive potential (or equivalently, by the electrostatic ﬁelds
of driven ion-acoustic perturbations). Particle bounce
motion signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the PDF near resonance,
since trapped particle phase mixing results in ﬂattening
of the PDF (for resonant velocities) and formation of
a plateau. Thus, the linear calculation of the Landau
dissipation, while correct for times short compared to
τtr, fails for
the typical bounce (trapping) time, τ
quasi-stationary waveforms for times τ & τN L ≫
τtr
(τN L is the typical nonlinear wave proﬁle evolution time).
Hence, Landau dissipation should be calculated non-
perturbatively to determine the resonant particle response
to the nonlinear wave.

≪

Of course, the nonlinear Landau damping problem is,
in general, not analytically tractable, as it requires ex-
plicit expressions for all particle trajectories as a function
of initial position and time. Such trajectories cannot be

lytic expression for the wave proﬁle shape is known and
may be assumed to persist, while the wave amplitude
varies. Calculations deﬁned in this way has been imple-
mented for the special cases of sinusoidal [9] and solitonic
[10] wave modulations. Other approaches either seek the
asymptotic (τ
) PDF for a given (undamped) wave-
form [11], or exploit the universality of the process of
de-trapping of resonant particles from a wave potential
of decreasing amplitude [12,13]. These approaches, how-
ever, do not appear to be useful for the problem consid-
ered here.

The goal of this work is to investigate how trapped
particles modify nonlinear wave evolution, assuming no
restrictions on the shape of the wave-packet modulation.
Thus, the motion of particles is treated self-consistently.
We show that, in the two important limits of short-time

τtr, the virial theorem is used
for determination of the time-asymptotic trapped parti-
cle response. Although the damping rate vanishes due to
phase mixing, the eﬀects of trapped particles are highly
non-trivial, leading to a signiﬁcant departure of the the-
ory from the familiar form of the DNLS and KNLS mod-
els. First, the power of the KNLS nonlinearity associated
with resonant particles increases to fourth order when
trapped particles are accounted for. Second, the eﬀective
coupling now is proportional to the curvature of the PDF
at resonant velocity, f ′′
0(vA), as
in linear theory. Third, the phase density of trapped par-
ticles is controlled by the plasma β. Finally, we combine
these to obtain the wave evolution equation which gov-
erns the long-time dynamics of quasi-stationary Alfv´enic
discontinuities. The equation is the principal result of
this Letter.

0 (vA), and not its slope, f ′

We should state here that particle trapping may be ab-
1
sent in higher than one dimension. Indeed, for k⊥ρi ≫
(k⊥ is the perpendicular component of the wave vector
and ρi is the ion Larmor radius), then the longitudinal
ˇCerenkov resonance ω = kkvk is satisﬁed for all parti-
cles having v = vA/ cos Θ, but with v⊥ arbitrarily large.
Thus, all particles with velocities v & vA interact with
a wave and a plateau cannot form, while a non-thermal
tail of energetic particles may result instead. However,
if the magnitude of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld is strong
1, quasi-one-dimensionality is re-
enough so that k⊥ρi ≪
covered. This last situation is, in fact, typical for waves
propagating in the Solar Wind.

For reasons of notational economy, let’s introduce the

scales, we conclude that the wave potential, as seen by
a trapped particle, is steady-state (i.e., roughly constant
on the particle bounce time) when τN L ≫

That is, particle phase mixing is very eﬃcient for weakly

the distortion of the PDF by a wave.
It was also re-
sponsible for linear damping in the KNLS equation. It is
interesting that the very possibility to write the general-
ized KNLS equation in the form (3) relies on the intrinsic
time reversibility of the Vlasov equation, linear or nonlin-
ear. Indeed, one can formally write the resonant particle

To estimate the number of trapped particles, we use

This allows us to ﬁnd the PDF such that the wave of a

In our problem there is only one resonance at v
vA,
since all modes are coherent. At large times, particle
bounces result in ﬂattening of the PDF at resonance so
that f ′
0. The height of this plateau (i.e., the
phase density of trapped particles) depends on the wave
evolution at earlier times. We take the “unperturbed”
(trial) PDF as superimposed plateau and Maxwellian, as
in Fig. 2:

0(vA)

→

≃

f0(v) = Fm(v) + [fp −

Fm(v)] ΘvA (∆v) ,

(14)

where Fm(v) is Maxwellian, the Θ-function is deﬁned as

and fp is the constant to be determined. The coeﬃcient
fp has a simple meaning of the phase density of trapped
particles after the plateau has been formed. Thus, the
state with fp > Fm(vA) corresponds to a clump on the
PDF and that with fp < Fm(vA) corresponds to a hole.
The kinetic equation for a perturbation of the PDF is:

β plasma (β & 1).

Finally, consider the there is weak wave damping not
associated with ˇCerenkov resonance (e.g., as in ion-
cyclotron or collisional damping). Then the wave am-
plitude will slowly decrease, keeping resonant particles

that is, the trapped particles will condense near the bot-
tom of the potential well, as the wave amplitude de-
creases. This results in a decrease in the eﬀective index
n, which approaches the asymptotic limit n
2. The
BGK analysis given above is, however, then no longer
applicable. It should be emphasized that trapped parti-
cles condense in the bottom of the potential, rather than
de-trap from it, as naively suggested in Ref. [12]. Thus,
no asymptotic, power-law damping exists in this case.
Obviously, our considerations above are rather generic
and valid for a wide class of nonlinear wave systems with
quadratic nonlinearity and higher, and thus call the va-
lidity of the results of Ref. [12] into general question.

→

To conclude, we have shown that the eﬀects of the
nonlinear PDF modiﬁcation by a high-amplitude Alfv´en
wave signiﬁcantly modify the dynamics of such a wave.
Even when phase mixing is eﬃcient enough to quench
linear Landau dissipation, trapped particles produce ﬁ-
nite a response which modiﬁes the wave nonlinearity.
The equation which explicitly describes the evolution
of quasi-stationary Alfv´enic discontinuities and asymp-
) dynamics of nonlinear Alfv´en waves, Eqs.
totic (τ
(3, 10), has been obtained.
this result constitutes the
extension of the well established DNLS-KNLS theory of
quasi-parallel nonlinear Alfv´en waves to the strongly non-
linear regime of particle trapping. The phase density of
trapped particles has been shown to be controlled by the
value of plasma β, as well as wave amplitude.

probably, not as general as it is claimed, and the problem
considered in this Letter is, in fact, one of the counter-
examples; see end of this Letter.

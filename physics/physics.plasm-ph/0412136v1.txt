INTRODUCTION

Burgers equation is well known to have a lot in common with the Navier-Stokes equation. In

particular it presents the same kind of advective nonlinearity, and a Reynolds number may be

deﬁned from the diffusion term [1]. In addition, this equation is much used as model for statistical

theories of turbulence from which asymptotical behaviours may be determined. But, from an

analytical point of view, this nonlinear equation is poor studied, the complete analytic solution

being closely dependent of the form of the forcing term. For example, the solution of the one

dimensional Burgers equation with a time-dependent forcing term

∂tu + u∂xu

ν ∂xxu = f (t)

u(x, 0) = ϕ(x),

may be obtained by two methods. The ﬁrst method lies on the Orlowsky-Sobczyk transforma-

tions (OS) [2], where the inhomogeneous Burgers equation (1) is transformed into a homogeneous

Burgers equation. Nevertheless, there exists an other equivalent method to solve analytically this

problem. By the way of the well-known Hopf-Cole transformation [3], an inhomogeneous Burgers

equation may be transformed into a linear equation: the heat equation with a source term, which is

nothing but a Schrödinger equation with an imaginary time, and a space and time dependent poten-

tial. Then, several methods have been developed over past decades to treat this kind of equations.

One of them, the “Time-Space Transformation method" (TST), has been used in order to solve the

Schrödinger equation with time dependent mass moving in a time dependent linear potential (M.

Feng [4]). It is thus shown, ref.[5], the equivalence between the TST method and the Orlowsky-

Sobczyk method, that is to say, the possibility to solve analytically by two equivalent ways the

Burgers equation with a forcing term in f (t). The following diagram resumes this equivalence,

where Heat-S designs the heat equation with a source term, BE the Burgers equation, and HC the

Hopf-Cole transformation.

This yields to present this paper as a continuation of the previous existing methods. The two latest

methods are adapted to treat the problem with a forcing term of the form

κ2x + f (t), where the

value κ2 represents the string constant of an elastic force. Let us note that Wospakrik and Zen [6]

−

have treated this problem but only in the limiting case where the diffusion coefﬁcient tends to zero

for the asymptotic mode, whereas the methods presented here are valid in all cases. The outline

of the paper will be thus as follows: the next section is devoted to the treatment of an elastic term,

ﬁrstly by the way of a TST method, and secondly by using a generalized OS method. Then, it

is shown that a Fokker-Planck equation, associated to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, arises in

the resolution by the TST method. Consequently, an “adapted” Hopf-Cole transformation may be

obtained for this case, wich allows physical interpretation in the asymptotic limit.

II. RESOLUTION FOR AN ELASTIC FORCING TERM

As underlined in the introduction, the TST method allows to solve a Schrödinger equation for

some kinds of potentials. So the inhomogeneous Burgers equation has ﬁrst to be transformed into

such an equation. Starting from the following one dimensional Burgers equation with a linear

forcing term

of equation permits to apply a TST method based on several change of variables. In [5], and

4ν x2

following [4], a TST method has been used in order to solve a Schrödinger equation with a linear

potential. Here, a quadratic potential appears in (3), so the method will consist this time to put

Ψ(x, t) = P (x, t)eh(x,t),

with h(x, t) = a1x2 + a2(t)x + a3(t) ; a1, a2(t) and a3(t) being constant or time-dependent

functions to be determined. The transformation (4) introduced in (3) gives

∂tP = ν ∂xxP + 2ν ∂xh ∂xP +

When Eqs. (7) are satisﬁed, Eq. (5) is simpliﬁed to

∂tP = ν ∂xxP + 2ν ∂xh ∂xP .

We now apply to Eq.(8) the following change of variables

Let us consider again Eq.(2), and let us introduce a new velocity v

v(x, t) such as

≡

u = vr(t) + αx + ψ(t) ,

(17)

where r(t), α, ψ(t) are time dependent functions or constant determined later. The transformation

(17) introduced in Eq.(2) yields to :

Notice that the relations (19a) and (19b) yield to the same expression as relation (13) for the

function r(t). Since the system (19) is veriﬁed, then Eq.(18) is simpliﬁed into

The interesting point lies in the connexion between the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (Eq.(29)) and

yields to the Fokker-Planck equation (29).

This interesting result implies two remarks. Firstly, this connection gives rise to a physical mean-

ing of the TST method. Indeed, the function P introduced in the transformation (4) is no more an

unspeciﬁed variable, but takes the sense of a transition probability for the variable x(t). Secondly,

considering the following scheme,

Notice that this expression is composed of a Hopf-Cole part and of a linear part. So, Eq.(35)

may be considered as an Hopf-Cole transformation adapted to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

and thus, from the relation (35), the asymptotic limit of the velocity will read

∼

which is a stationary solution. This result being valid whatever the initial condition on the velocity

may be. We can conclude on the fact that an elastic forcing term applied to the system gives

rise to a stationary transition probability in the asymptotic mode. Consequently, the effects of

the oscillations will decrease, up to disappear in the long time limit, and stabilize the system

with a velocity proportional to the squareroot of the string constant. Indeed, for a forcing term

f (x) =

κ2x The evanescence of the effect of the force is due to the initial condition sensitivity

−

of the Burgers equation. We can see thereby on the system, a phenomenon closely connected to

the turbulence effect: the lost of memory in the long-time limit.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have presented the complete analytical solution of the Burgers equation with an elastic

forcing term. The methods presented here have been used before but only in the case of a time-

dependent forcing term. As a perspective, we can say that the generalisation of the methods to any

order of power of x seems actually be a hardly task. Indeed, a transformation of the form y

→
r(t)x + q(t), has been introduce in order to delete terms proportional to x. So this transformation

seems without effect when higher powers of x appear. Moreover, the more the degree will be

high, the more the resolution will be difﬁcult, due to the increasing number of variables to be

introduce. The second main result of the paper lies in the existence of links between a ﬂuid

model (Burgers) and a particle model (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck). By a set of transformations, we have

connected the Burgers equation for the velocity u = dx/dt to a Fokker-Planck equation for the

transition probability of the variable x. From the Burgers equation (2), the transformation (34)

allows to get directly the Fokker-Planck equation (29) as a speciﬁc Hopf-Cole transformation. It

appears that the linear force, describing the Ornstein-uhlenbeck process, stabilize the system in the

asymptotic mode with a velocity proportional to the square root of the string constant of the force

applied initialy, and this, whatever the initial condition on the velocity may be. This result shows

a hidden property of turbulence: the unpredictability of a velocity ﬁeld governed by the Burgers

equation, i.e the Burgers turbulence.

APPENDIX: SOLUTION OF THE ORNSTEIN-UHLENBECK PROCESS

We show that we can recover solution (30) by the way of our TST method. Rewriting equation

we apply the change of variable

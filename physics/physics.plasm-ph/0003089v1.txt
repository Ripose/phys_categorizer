An analysis of axisymmetric equilibria with arbitrary incompressible ﬂow and ﬁnite resistivity
is presented.
It is shown that with large aspect ratio approximation or vanishing poloidal cur-
rent, a uniform conductivity proﬁle is consistent with equilibrium ﬂows. Also a comment made on
coexistence of both toroidal and poloidal ﬂows in an axisymmetric ﬁeld-reversed conﬁguration.

Calculating the equilibrium is one of the fundamental
problems of magnetically conﬁned plasmas. Most stud-
ies are directed toward ﬁnding an ideal (i.e. inﬁnitely
conducting) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in
an axisymmetric plasma. The earliest calculations are
those of Grad1 and Shafranov2, leading to the famous
Grad-Shafranov equation1–3. The ideal and static Grad-
Shafranov equation is an elliptic diﬀerential equation in
the magnetic ﬂux function ψ with two arbitrary surface
quantities as the pressure p(ψ) and the poloidal current
I(ψ).

Consequently, there have been attempts to include var-
ious eﬀects e.g. mass ﬂow into the equilibrium equations.
An equivalent of Grad-Shafranov equation in an axisym-
metric ideal plasma with arbitrary ﬂow has been given
by Hameiri4.
In some recent works, Steinhauer5 deals
with a generalization of Grad-Shafranov equilibria in a
multi-ﬂuid with ﬂow and Throumoulopoulos and Tasso6
consider a helically symmetric equilibria with ﬂow. The
situation with ﬂow becomes more realistic when one re-
alizes the existence of equilibrium ﬂows both in toroidal
and poloidal directions in tokamaks following momentum
deposition through heating by neutral beam injection7–9.
With equilibrium ﬂows, the resultant governing diﬀeren-
tial equation does not remain always elliptic10,11. The in-
vestigation of a general MHD equilibrium becomes much
more complicated when one tries to include the eﬀects
of other important factors, say of viscous stress tensor.
Recently Ren et al.12 have studied the deformation of
magnetic island by including the eﬀect of sheared ﬂow
and viscosity into an ideal two-dimensional MHD equi-
librium conﬁguration. However, there is an element of
inconsistency, whether an ideal equilibrium is realistic13.
Heuristically, one ignores the resistivity in the Ohm’s law
while calculating the equilibrium, but then a resistive
stability analysis based on a stationary equilibrium re-
mains questionable as long as the ﬁeld diﬀusion is not
taken into account14. Montgomery et al.13 have investi-
gated the problem on non-ideal static axisymmetric equi-
librium. There have also been attempts to calculate resis-

tive axisymmetric equilibrium with only toroidal ﬂow10.
It has been further argued that tokamak equilibrium ﬂow
is either purely toroidal7,9 or the poloidal component is
small8 and quickly damped by magnetic pumping15. So
there is a natural tendency to exclude the poloidal ﬂow
while calculating an equilibrium. But when one consid-
ers ﬁnite conductivity with purely equilibrium toroidal
ﬂow, the conductivity (hence the resistivity) becomes a
function of space. In general, the resistivity is not a ﬂux
function10,13 irrespective of equilibrium ﬂow. In this re-
port, we ask the very pertinent question, whether the sit-
uation changes in presence of poloidal ﬂow. As we show
that a uniform resistivity proﬁle is consistent in presence
of poloidal ﬂow, whereas it has been shown that a scalar
pressure equilibrium can not have uniform resistivity16.
Further we show that in a ﬁeld-reversed (FRC) axisym-
metric conﬁguration with no toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, both
toroidal and poloidal equilibrium ﬂows can coexist with
ﬁnite resistivity, which is not found to be the case with
ideal equilibrium17.

We consider the equilibrium resistive MHD equations

with plasma ﬂow. The equations are

∇ · (ρv) = 0,

∇ · B = 0, ∇ × E = 0, ∇ × B = 0,

E + v × B = j/σ,

ρ(v · ∇)v = j × B − ∇p,

where the symbols have their usual meanings. We use
a right handed cylindrical system (r, θ, z) with z as the
axis of symmetry, θ as the toroidal angle, and r along the
major radius of an axisymmetric device. We assume the
plasma ﬂow to be arbitrary (toroidal and poloidal) and
axisymmetry is assumed i.e. ∂/∂θ = 0. The plasma resis-
tivity η = σ−1 is assumed to be an unspeciﬁed function
of r and z. We have further assumed here that the equi-
librium is maintained in a steady-state through resistive
diﬀusion. The magnetic induction equation allows us to
write the magnetic ﬁeld as

where ψ is the magnetic ﬂux function which is the az-
imuthal component of the vector potential A and I is
the current function. Similarly, following the continuity
equation, Eq.(1), we can express the plasma equilibrium
velocity as

v =

1
ρr

∇ϕ × ˆeθ + ωrˆeθ,

(6)

I = 0 and large aspect ratio approximation is not re-
quired. It can be noted here that without any approxima-
tion, ω becomes a ﬂux function when one considers ideal
equilibrium4 or resistive equilibrium with only toroidal
ﬂow10.

Now, we consider the momentum equation Eq.(4) and
its ˆeθ component. With the above approximations, we
can write Eq.(4) as

where ϕ is the velocity stream function and ω = vθ/r is
the toroidal angular velocity. We also assume that the
ﬂow is incompressible i.e. ∇ · v = 0.

Because the ﬂow is now in both toroidal and poloidal
direction, the poloidal component of current, jp need not
vanish. In general the current can be expressed as

j = −

where ∆∗ is the elliptic operator deﬁned by ∆∗ψ =

r2 ∇ψ(cid:1) . Taking curl of the Ohm’s law Eq.(3), we

∇ × (v × B) = ∇ × (j/σ)

with

v × B =

ρr2 ∇ϕ + ω∇ψ.

The ˆeθ component of Eq.(8) can be now written as

We now invoke the large aspect ratio expansion and
assume that toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, to the ﬁrst approx-
imation can be written Bθ ≃ B0r0/r. Here, B0 is the
value of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld at center of the cylin-
drical cross section of the torus at distance r0 from the
axis of symmetry. To this eﬀect we have the current
function I ≈ B0r0 = const. Under these assumption, the
above equation can be written as

ˆeθ · ∇ω × ∇ψ = −

I

ρr3 ˆeθ · ∇r × ∇ϕ.

(11)

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of the above equa-
tion vanishes by virtue of the incompressibility condition
and the continuity equation. We neglect the second term
because of its 1/r3 dependence and ﬁnd that the toroidal
angular velocity vθ/r = ω(ψ) becomes a surface quantity.
This also further means that j = jθˆeθ with jp = 0. We,
however, note that the condition ω ≡ ω(ψ) is identically
satisﬁed in a ﬁeld-reversed conﬁguration (FRC) where

In the above equation Bp is the poloidal component of
the magnetic ﬁeld and (′) denotes derivative with respect
to ψ. Taking the ˆeθ component of the above equation,
we have,

ˆeθ · ∇ϕ × ∇(ωr2) = 0,

(13)

which means that ϕ ≡ ϕ(ωr2). We take the simplest
situation of ϕ ∝ ωr2 which yields another surface quan-
tity, ϕ/r2 = ζ(ψ). However, it is important to note that,
ζ(ψ) is not an arbitrary function in the sense that it is
proportional to the toroidal velocity ω(ψ) i.e. the toroidal
and poloidal ﬂows are no longer independent. Physically,
one can understand this by noting that ﬁnite resistivity
allows plasma motion across the the ﬂux surfaces. Equiv-
alently, toroidal ﬂow, in a resistive axisymmetric plasma,
is always associated with poloidal ﬂow.

Because of equilibrium ﬂow, however, plasma pressure
p is no longer a ﬂux function now. Taking the Bp com-
ponent of the momentum equation (Eq.(12)), we have

ρ

(14)

Depending upon the equation of state, now, several
options are possible. However, we note that density, in
general, is not a ﬂux function in presence of arbitrary
plasma ﬂow. this can be easily seen from the equation
of continuity Eq.(1), after applying the incompressibility
condition,

ˆeθ · ∇ϕ × ∇ρ = 0.

(15)

It can be seen from the above expression that ρ is not a
surface quantity. We note here that axisymmetric equi-
libria with incompressible equilibrium ﬂows are generally
associated with constant density magnetic surfaces18–20.
One is also free to choose density as a ﬂux function in
case of resistive axisymmetric equilibrium with only in-
compressible toroidal ﬂow10.

Taking the ˆeθ component of Ohm’s law Eq.(3) along
with Eq.(9), we have an expression for plasma conduc-
tivity,

σ(cid:18)E0r0 +

2
ρ

rζBr(cid:19) + ∆∗ψ = 0,

(16)

where E0 is the longitudinal externally applied electric
ﬁeld at major radius r = r0. We immediately see from
the above expression that conductivity, in general, is a
space dependent quantity.

In what follows, we shall consider two cases with
(i) uniform and constant density and (ii) a nonuniform
density. In the second case, we consider isentropic mag-
netic surfaces. We now assume that plasma density is
uniform and constant i.e. ρ = const. and normalize our
equations to ρ = 1. We can now write Eq.(14) as,

isentropic magnetic surfaces10. The equation of state can
now be written as, p = Sργ, where, S(ψ) is the entropy
which is a ﬂux function and γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats.
We now write Bp · ∇p/ρ as Bp · ∇[γSργ−1/(γ − 1)], so
that equivalent Bernoulli’s equation can be written as,

where Θ(ψ) is arbitrary. As we have assumed previously,
it requires a solubility condition and the equivalent to
the assumption (20). We can then continue to write the
equivalent Grad-Shafranov equation by taking the ∇ψ
component of the momentum equation and applying the
Bernoulli’s law Eq.(22),

r2 ∆∗(ζr2)Bp · ∇(ζr2) = 0.

(20)

Together with Eq.(18) and the above assumption, the ∇ψ
component of the momentum equation yields the equiv-
alent Grad-Shafranov equation,

∆∗ψ + r2(χ′ + ω ′ω2r) +

∆∗(ζr2)∇ψ · ∇(ζr2)

|∇ψ|2

= 0, (21)

with two arbitrary ﬂux functions χ(ψ) and ω(ψ). The
primes refer derivative with respect to ψ.

We now consider the second case where we consider
a nonuniform density. With incompressible ﬂow, mag-
netic surfaces with constant entropy is quite a reasonable
approximation in ideal MHD4,21. However, considering
long resistive diﬀusion time, the right hand side of Eq.(3)
can be neglected and we can continue to proceed with

In the above equation we have four arbitrary surface
quantities i.e. Θ(ψ), ω(ψ), and S(ψ) and the primes de-
note derivative with respect to ψ.

We have derived the diﬀerential equations, equivalent
to the Grad-Shafranov equation, for resistive axisymmet-
ric plasma with arbitrary equilibrium ﬂows. These equi-
librium equations Eqs.(21, 23) have to be solved subject
to conductivity constraint Eq.(16). Further, in a ﬁeld-
reversed conﬁguration (FRC) with no toroidal magnetic
ﬁeld, it can be seen from Eq.(13) that both poloidal and
toroidal ﬂow can coexist.

We now show that a uniform conductivity proﬁle is
consistent with resistive axisymmetric equilibria with ar-
bitrary ﬂow. A simple examination of Eq.(4), though
reveals that uniform conductivity may be possible with
scalar pressure equilibrium in presence of ﬂow, it how-
ever provides no easier way of proving it. We note that
the usual procedure for solving Eqs.(21) and (23) requires
specifying a priori dependence of the respective arbitrary
functions on ψ. However, in the presence of ﬁnite resis-
tivity, the resistivity constraint Eq.(16) can be used to
solve for ψ, which is uniquely determined if the right
hand side of Eq.(16) is speciﬁed16. It should be noted
here with caution whether the resultant solution for ψ
corresponds to realistic proﬁles for other physical quan-
tities such as pressure, density, velocity etc. However,
our sole aim, here, is to demonstrate the existence of a
solution consistent with uniform resistivity in presence of
ﬂows.

From Eq.(15) we know that ρ ≡ ρ(ϕ), and assume that
ρ ∝ ϕ. We now assume that conductivity is uniform in
space so that the resulting Eq.(16) can be written as,

is r0 = 1.25.

where α and β are arbitrary constants. It is worthwhile
mentioning at this point that Eq.(24) can not be used
in case of very small resistivity. In the limit of vanishing
resistivity (large β in the above equation), the solution of
Eq.(24) contains short scale spatial dependence (bound-
ary layers), not present in case of ideal equilibrium and
may lead to unphysical results.

Note that the above equation is a elliptic equation and
can be treated as boundary value problem. Following
Zheng et al.22, we assume a solution of the form

ψh(r, z) = Xn=0,1,2,...

fn(r)zn

(25)

for the homogeneous part of Eq.(24). We however re-
tain the odd terms in the summation to take care of
the asymmetric-term in Eq.(24). For simplicity we as-
sume that fn(r) = 0 for n ≥ 3, which, however, can
be extended up to any number of terms if required,
about which we shall make a comment later. Substi-
tuting Eq.(25) in the equivalent homogeneous equation
for Eq.(24) we can solve for the functions f0,1,2(r). The
homogeneous solution of Eq.(24) is then given by,

ψh(r, z) = a1r2{4r2 + 16z 2 − α2[4(ln r)2 − 4 ln r + 2

− r2] + 8αz(r2 − 2 ln r)} + a2[2r2(2 ln r
− 1) − α2 ln r(ln r + 1) + 4αz ln r + 4z 2]
+ a3r2[α(2 ln r − 1) + 4z] + a4r2,

(26)

where ais are arbitrary constants to be determined from
the boundary conditions. A particular solution of Eq.(24)
is ψp = βr2(2 ln r − 1)/4. So the complete solution of
Eq.(24) is

In principle the expansion in Eq.(26) should be re-
tained with a large number of terms which will result
a equally large number of arbitrary constants for the so-
lution in ψ. These constants can then be used to shape
any arbitrarily shaped plasma boundary.

In passing, we would like to note that resistive ﬁeld
diﬀusion (∂B/∂t 6= 0) is intrinsically involved with non-
stationary equilibria (v 6= 0). However, a series of ideal
quasi-stationary equilibrium states can be built up with
∂B/∂t = 0 in which, the eﬀect of ﬁnite resistivity is
only to slowly evolve the equilibrium in a diﬀusive time
scale23.

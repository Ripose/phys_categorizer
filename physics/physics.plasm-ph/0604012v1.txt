In suﬃciently large gaps and electric ﬁelds, discharge streamers do branch. In [Array´as et al.,
PRL 88, 174502 (2002)], we observed streamer branching numerically within a deterministic particle
density model and explained it as a Laplacian instability of a thin space charge layer. Our numerical
results were criticized in [Kulikovsky, PRL 89, 229401 (2002)]. We here present an adaptive grid
reﬁnement method for streamer simulations, and we carry out the ﬁrst conclusive investigation on
the eﬀect of the numerical grid on streamer branching in diﬀerent ﬁelds. On stepwise ﬁner grids the
branching time converges, hence streamer branching is for the ﬁrst time predicted quantitatively.

Problem setting and review. Streamers are tran-
sient weakly ionized plasma channels that rapidly grow
into a non- or weakly ionized medium under inﬂuence
of the self-enhanced electric ﬁeld at their tip. They
are widely used in technology [1, 2] and ubiquitous in
nature, where they play a role in creating the path of
sparks,
lightning [3] and of blue jets above thunder-
clouds. Streamers are also directly observed as so-called
sprites [4, 5, 6], which are very large discharge structures
in the higher parts of the atmosphere that are composed
of ten thousands of streamers. Despite their high ve-
locity, streamer evolution is now directly observable in
experiments; a further review can be found in [2].

Streamers commonly branch in experiments if gap and
applied voltage are large enough. Recently a debate has
risen about the proper physical concept for this branch-
ing.
In 1939, Raether [7] proposed a mechanism for
streamer propagation and Loeb and Meek [8] developed it
into a branching concept that nowadays is found in many
textbooks. The concept is based on a uniformly charged
streamer head; ahead of it stochastic processes create
secondary avalanches, that subsequently develop into dif-
ferent branches. However, the distribution of rare elec-
trons due to photo-ionization or background ionization
ahead of the streamer has never been shown to agree with
the conceptual pictures, and the concept has never been
demonstrated to work. Furthermore, simulations in the
past two decades [9, 10, 11, 12] have shown that the fully
developed streamer head is not homogeneously charged,
but rather neutral and surrounded by a thin space charge
layer which enhances the ﬁeld ahead of it and screens it in
the interior; this ﬁeld enhancement allows the streamer
to penetrate regions with a rather low background ﬁeld.
Recent simulations also show that a streamer can branch
within a fully deterministic model for charged particle
densities, in a non-uniform background ﬁeld [13, 14, 15]
as well as in a uniform ﬁeld [16, 17, 18], provided certain
requirements on the external parameters are met (e.g. a
suﬃciently strong background electric ﬁeld and a suﬃ-
ciently long gap).

Some of the present authors have proposed [16, 17]
a physical explanation of these numerical observations
that is directly related to the formation of the thin space
charge layer: the layer creates an almost equipotential

streamer head that can undergo a Laplacian instability
and branch in a manner similar to branching instabil-
ities of ﬂuid interfaces in viscous ﬁngering. For a fur-
ther discussion of the conceptual questions of streamer
branching, we refer to [2]. However, the numerical codes
used in [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] were not able to test the
branching conditions on ﬁne numerical grids. This lead
some researchers to question the physical nature of the
instabilities [14, 15, 19, 20] despite the analytical argu-
ments given in [16, 17] and later in [21, 22].

To resolve the debate from the numerical side, we
have developed a code with comoving adaptive grids and
we here present its results. The algorithm enables us to
run the simulations on very ﬁne grids; therefore for the
ﬁrst time the eﬀect of numerical grids on the branching
process is investigated quantitatively. We here present
its results: branching occurs both at very high ﬁelds like
in Refs. [16, 17] and also at fairly low background ﬁelds
if the discharge has suﬃcient space to develop; and the
branching time saturates on suﬃciently ﬁne numerical
grids. This enables us to give the ﬁrst quantitative
predictions on streamer branching.

Model and multiscale structure of negative
streamers. We investigate a minimal continuum model
for streamers, which contains the essential physics for
negative streamers in a non-attaching pure gas like N2 or
Ar [9, 10, 16, 17]. The model is a two-ﬂuid approximation
for the charged particles, with a local ﬁeld dependent im-
pact ionization reaction coupled to the Poisson equation
for electrostatic particle interactions. We investigate this
model in a cylindrically symmetric geometry, reducing
it to eﬀectively two dimensions. This constraint sup-
presses one degree of freedom for the instability modes,
and therefore the time of branching in this cylindrical
geometry is an upper bound for the branching time in a
genuine three dimensional system [2, 23]. In dimension-
less units, the model reads

∂τ σ = ∇ · (σE + D∇σ) + σ|E| α(|E|),
∂τ ρ = σ|E| α(|E|), α(|E|) = e−1/|E|,

−∇2φ = ρ − σ , E = −∇φ,

(3)

where σ and ρ are the electron and positive ion densities,

respectively. E and φ are respectively the electric ﬁeld
and potential, D is the electron diﬀusion coeﬃcient and τ
is the dimensionless time. The characteristic scales in this
model depend on the neutral gas density; therefore the
simulation results can be applied to high altitude sprite
discharges at low pressures as well as to high pressure
laboratory experiments. We refer to [2, 17, 24] for more
details on the dimensional analysis.

A planar cathode is placed at z = 0 and a planar an-
ode at z = Lz. The potential at the electrodes is ﬁxed,
φ(r, z = 0, τ ) = 0, φ(r, z = Lz, τ ) = φ0 > 0, generating
a background electric ﬁeld with strength |E b| = φ0/Lz
along the negative z-direction. The streamer is initiated
by an electrically neutral Gaussian ionization seed on the
axis of symmetry at the cathode (r = z = 0). There is
no background ionization far from the initial seed.

We impose homogeneous Neumann conditions for the
electron density at all boundaries. This results in a net
inﬂow of electrons from the cathode if the streamer is

volume is restricted in the radial direction by a bound-
ary Lr suﬃciently far away not to disturb the solution
near and in the streamer. Moreover, we choose the inter-
electrode distance Lz so large that the streamer does not
feel the anode proximity for the results shown.

The generic spatial structure of the streamer is already
discussed above and can be seen in the ﬁgures: it contains
a wide range of spatial scales, from the very extended
non-ionized medium on which the Poisson equation has
to be solved through the length of the conducting channel
and its width up to the inner structure of the thin space
charge layer around the streamer head.

Moreover, the region just ahead of the streamer where
the ﬁeld is substantially enhanced and the electron den-
sity is low, is highly unstable, in the sense that a small
ionized perturbation will grow much more rapidly than
in the mere background ﬁeld. This unstable region ahead
of the streamer tip is commonly referred to as leading
edge [24, 26]. It requires special care when considering
numerical methods [25, 26]. Accurate simulations of
streamers therefore pose a great computational challenge.

Numerical algorithm.

In order to deal eﬃciently
with the numerical challenges posed by this model, it
has been implemented in a numerical code using adap-
tive grid reﬁnements. We recall the essential features of
this algorithm and refer to [25] for further details. The
spatial discretizations are based on ﬁnite volumes, using
a ﬂux limiting scheme to prevent spurious oscillations in
the results near steep gradients. The time stepping is per-
formed with a two-stage explicit Runge-Kutta method.
Using an explicit time-stepping method allows us to
decouple the computational grids for the continuity equa-
tions (1)-(2) on the one hand from those for the Poisson
equation (3) on the other hand. The particle densities are
ﬁrst updated on a series of nested, stepwise reﬁned grids.
Then the Poisson equation, using the computed densities
as an input, is solved on another series of nested, step-

dicated over the plots. The upper snapshots at τ =10000 are
taken before branching and the lower ones after branching,
at time τ = 11250. The contours correspond to the same

wise reﬁned grids. The electric ﬁeld on the grids for the
continuity equations is then calculated from the poten-
tial computed on the grids for the Poisson equation using
suﬃciently accurate interpolations [27].

Adequate reﬁnement criteria for the continuity and
for the Poisson equation then lead to a grid distribu-
tion which is especially designed to cope adequately and
eﬃciently with the diﬃculties inherent to both type of
equations. More speciﬁcally, the reﬁnement criterion for
the grids for the Poisson equation is based on error esti-
mate of the solution. The reﬁnement criterion for grids
for the continuity equations uses a curvature monitor of
the solution. Moreover, it takes explicitly into account
the leading edge, where the densities are low but the elec-
tric ﬁeld is greatly enhanced [24, 26].

The reﬁnement criterion is computed at each time
step, in such a way that the series of nested, consec-
utively reﬁned grids move with the solution. Special
care has been taken for the discretizations as well as the
mapping of the solution from one grid to the other to be
charge conserving.

Results. The adaptive grid reﬁnement procedure en-
ables us to resolve the streamer with very high accuracy,
and thus to investigate the dependence of the branching

the numerical diﬀusion introduced on such a coarse grid
by the ﬂux limiter that switches to the diﬀusive ﬁrst or-
der scheme in regions with large gradients. This numer-
ical diﬀusion smears the electrons out over the streamer
head, which in turn results in lower ﬁeld enhancement
and lower ionization rates. The results on ﬁner meshes
of 4 and 2 on the other hand do agree with each other.

The branching in time is the same in all cases. Fig. 1
shows that the inﬂuence of the numerical grid on the
branching state rapidly decreases, and we thus can carry
out not only qualitative but also quantitative numerical
experiments of the streamer evolution up to branching.
These results show that branching is possible at lower
electric ﬁelds than those of [16, 17]. Branching was not
observed in earlier simulations at lower ﬁelds [9, 10]
because the discharge gap was too short.

We now consider a negative streamer in a dimen-
sionless background ﬁeld of E b = 0.5 corresponding to
100 kV/cm in N2 at atmospheric pressure in a gap of
Lz = 2048, or 4.6 mm. These external parameters are
as in [16, 17]. The initial seed is also taken as in [17],
i.e., a Gaussian with amplitude 10−4 and characteristic
radius 10, which corresponds to a maximal electron and
ion number density of 5 · 1010 cm−3 and an 1/e-radius of
23 µm for N2 under normal conditions.

However, while [16] used a uniform grid of h = 2 and
[17] one of h = 1, we now perform computations on a
ﬁnest grid as small as hf = 1/8, i.e., more than a decade
ﬁner. More precisely, the coarsest mesh width is set to

tive branching time (lower row), computed on diﬀerent ﬁnest

domain is z ≤ Lz = 2048 and r ≤ Lr = Lz/2.

process on the numerical grid. The results are obtained
on increasingly ﬁner grid sizes hf , always taking the
same coarsest mesh width hc for both the continuity
and the Poisson equations.
If the branching were of
numerical nature, we would expect that branching times
on increasingly ﬁner grids would not converge.

We ﬁrst consider negative streamers evolving in a low
background ﬁeld of E b = 0.15 corresponding to 30 kV/cm
for N2 at atmospheric pressure. We use an electrically
neutral, dense and relatively wide Gaussian ionization
seed at the cathode, with a maximum of 1/4.8, and a
characteristic radius of 10. This corresponds to a max-
imal electron and ion number density of 1014 cm−3 and
an 1/e radius of 230 µm. The gap length and width are
set to Lz = 2Lr = 215 = 32768, which corresponds to an
inter-electrode distance of approximately 7.5 cm.

The coarsest mesh width is set to hc = 64, and the
ﬁnest one to hf = 8, 4 and 2. When a ﬁnest mesh of 8
is used, the electron density in the streamer is lower, as
can be seen in the upper row in Fig. 1. This is due to

4

hc = 2, and the ﬁnest one to hf = 2, 1, . . . , 1/8. Further-
more a better numerical scheme is used: ﬂux limiting [25]
rather than 3rd order upwind [16, 17].

Before branching, at τ =275, Fig. 2 shows that there is
a quantitative diﬀerence between the results on a mesh
with hf =1 and the other three. As in the low ﬁeld case,
numerical diﬀusion spreads the space charge layer, which
makes the ﬁeld enhancement at the streamer tip and
the ﬁeld screening in the streamer body less eﬃcient.
Consequently, the ionization rate, and therefore the
electron density, are higher in the streamer body.
In
the low ﬁeld case we do not observe this because the
background ﬁeld is negligibly low, hence a less eﬃcient
screening will not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the ionization rate
in the streamer body.
It is clear that on meshes ﬁner
than 1/2, the results are the same during the stable
streamer propagation. It is only after the branching that
diﬀerent states are observed on those very ﬁne grids.
However, the time of branching converges within this
range of mesh widths hf as shown in the upper plot in
Fig. 2.

Discussion, conclusion and outlook. We empha-
size that the branching times converge on decreasing nu-
merical grids in both cases. Therefore we here present
the ﬁrst conclusive and quantitative numerical predic-
tions on streamer branching. However, in contrast to the
low ﬁeld case, the lower plots in Fig. 2 show that in the
high ﬁeld case diﬀerent branched modes are reached af-
ter approximately the same evolution time: in two cases,

the maximal electron density and ﬁeld is on the axis of
symmetry, and in two other cases, it is oﬀ axis. Ap-
parently, there are diﬀerent branched states reachable at
bifurcation and tiny diﬀerences determine which one will
be reached. Such extreme sensitivity is well-known from
deterministic chaos; it is generic for nonlinear dynamics
near bifurcation points. On the other hand, the unstable
state is reached in a deterministic manner, and therefore
the branching times converge.

But why is there once a unique branched state and
once several? The answer can be found in Fig. 3 showing
the two relevant spatial scales, namely the thickness of
the space charge layer and the radius of the channel. In
the high ﬁeld case, the ratio of layer thickness over radius
is much smaller than in the low ﬁeld case. Moreover, the
ﬁeld screening and enhancement is much stronger and
the equipotential lines follow the space charge layer much
better. Therefore the high ﬁeld streamer is much closer
to interfacial models as discussed in [2, 16, 21, 22, 24] and
can access more branching modes. This critical state in
future work will be characterized by the electric charge
content and electric ﬁeld and potential at the streamer
tip which would then allow us to relate branching to the
external electric circuit. For sketches of such ideas as
well as for a discussion of photo-ionization eﬀects and of
continuum versus particle models, we refer to [2].

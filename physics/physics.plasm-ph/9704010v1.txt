Ionized Plasma in Cylindrical Geometry

ABSTRACT

The properties of a partially ionized plasma in a long cylindrical tube subject to a
uniform axial electric ﬁeld are investigated. The plasma is maintained by an external
ionizing source balanced by bulk and surface recombinations. Collisions between neutrals,
whose density greatly exceeds the density of charged particles, and of neutrals with ions
are suﬃciently eﬀective for their velocity distribution to be close to a Maxwellian with the
same uniform temperature, independent of the external ﬁeld. The behavior of the plasma
is described by a collisional two-ﬂuid scheme with charge neutrality in the interior of the
tube. Approximate nonlinear equations for the hydrodynamical moments are obtained
from a Boltzmann equation in which electron-neutral, electron-ion and electron-electron
collisions are all important. It is found that under certain circumstances the current, and
the temperature of the electrons undergo a drastic change, with hysteresis, as the electric
ﬁeld is varied.

I. Introduction

Instabilities are ubiquitous in strongly ionized plasmas. They dominate the behavior
of such systems and their study forms the core of the subject. The origin of the instabilities
lies in the nature of the plasma interactions: on the one hand they are long range and thus
can produce strong cooperative eﬀects and on the other hand they become ’weaker’ locally
at high energies (or temperatures) as manifested by the decrease of the Coulomb cross
section with energy rise1. The situation is diﬀerent in weakly ionized cold plasmas, systems
which have attracted much attention recently2,3. In such systems collective phenomena
play a smaller role and instabilities are less common. Nevertheless there are cooperative
phenomena in these systems too, which, as we have shown earlier4,5 for homogeneous
idealized systems and will show here for more realistic laboratory situations, can lead to

1

dramatic abrupt changes in the state of the plasma, when such systems are driven by
external ﬁelds.

There is a large literature on the behavior of plasma in a cylindrical geometry (see
for example Refs.6,7,8,9). The reason for considering this system again here is that we are
interested in a regime in which the electrons are colder than in the self-sustained discharge
plasmas generally investigated. The plasma has a suﬃciently high degree of ionization to
make the electron- electron and electron-ion collisions important. The condition of low
electron temperature permits us to neglect inelastic collisions but requires that we include
volume recombination eﬀects.

The phenomenon in which we are most interested is a rapid, essentially abrupt, change
in the electron temperature and current as the external electric ﬁeld crosses a certain
critical value which depends on the neutral–ion temperature, degree of ionization, etc. The
phenomenon is related to the well known runaway eﬀect in fully ionized plasmas caused
by the decrease of the electron-ion collision cross section as the external ﬁeld increases the
electron energy10,11,12. In the partially ionized gas the presence of the neutrals prevents
such a runaway. In fact, if one neglects collisions between the electrons (e-e), as is done in
the swarm approximation13, valid when the degree of ionization is suﬃciently small, then
the stationary distribution (in the absence of inelastic collisions) will be of the Druyvesteyn
form14 for which the current and electron mean energy are smooth functions of the external
ﬁeld. The situation is similar when the size of the plasma is smaller than the energy
relaxation length of the electrons9. There are, however, other regimes, even in weakly
ionized plasmas, where the eﬀect of the e-e collisions is suﬃcient to keep the electron
distribution close to a Maxwellian10,4. Such conditions can lead to cooperative abrupt
changes in the temperature and drift velocity of electrons as the external ﬁeld is varied.
The origin of the phenomenon is made clearer if one starts with a kinetic approach rather
than with a macroscopic description.

While it is possible, even likely, that eﬀects related to those discussed here have already
been observed indirectly in the behavior of discharges it would be useful for both theoretical
and practical reasons to have experiments in which the parameters can be controlled, so as
to study the phenomena in a quantitative way. We expect that the transition will be seen
as hysteresis in the current–voltage (I-V) characteristic of the plasma when the external
electric ﬁeld is slowly varying in time4,5.

We shall consider an experimental arrangement consisting of a weakly ionized gas in
a tube of radius R subjected to a constant external axial electric ﬁeld E. The plasma
is assumed for simplicity to be produced through uniform ionization inside the tube, by
some external source, at a constant rate a. It is balanced by two kinds of recombination
processes: a bulk one and a surface process on the tube wall. The main bulk recombination
for the regime we are interested in, are10 three body processes involving two electrons
plus an ion, and dissociative recombinations in which a metastable atom-ion complex
recombines with an electron. The rates depend on the temperatures and densities of
the electrons, ions and neutrals in a rather complicated way; see Ref.15. For the sake
of simplicity we lump the two processes together and assume an eﬀective rate of bulk
recombination proportional to T −3/2, where T is the electron temperature. We ignore
the dependence of this rate on the neutral and ion temperature and on the pressure

2

(1a)

(1b)

which we keep more or less constant. The recombination at the wall is also treated
phenomenologically.
In particular we assume that the energy is absorbed by the wall
which is kept at a ﬁxed temperature, see section 4.

We have in mind here a situation in which the great majority of neutral atoms are
some kind of noble gas to which may, or may not, be added a small amount of a more easily
ionized second species, though we realize that in the latter case the analysis would be more
complicated16. This will be reﬂected mainly in the rates of ionization a and recombination
γ since we shall always consider a regime in which the density of electrons n(r, t) is much
lower than that of the neutrals, N , but big enough, due to the great disparity between the
electron mass, m, and the ion–neutral mass, M , for binary electron-electron collisions to
dominate the energy exchanges in electron-ion and electron-neutral (e-i and e-n) collisions.
This requires4 that

<< 1.

Here k is the Boltzmann constant, and σ is the total electron-neutral particle collision
cross section, which is taken to be a constant in our work. Putting in appropriate values
for the parameters on the left side of (1a) gives (see Ref.4),

for He, Ne, Ar plasmas respectively, when kT is approximately 1 eV and it decreases as
T 2 for colder electrons. The upper bound relates to the fact that we ignore any collective
self induced electrostatic or magnetic interactions.

The ions in our model are assumed to have a uniform temperature, Ti, the same as the
neutrals, while their density is n(r, t), i.e. the plasma is treated as locally quasi-neutral. We
assume axial symmetry and longitudinal homogeneity so the spatial dependence is only in
the radial variable r
R. The diﬀerent mobilities of ions and electrons are compensated
by an internally generated radial ambipolar electric ﬁeld F(r, t). We are thinking of a
quiescent, long positive column which ﬁlls the tube6.

≤

The reason for considering external rather than ﬁeld induced ionization is that in our
previous works4,5, in which we considered a spatially homogeneous case with an a priori
ﬁxed plasma density, we found that as we varied the external ﬁeld E, there was a transition
in the electron distribution between regimes of weak and strong coupling to the ions. (Ref.5
presents a rigorous proof of such a transition for a greatly simpliﬁed model system). This
mechanism of a kinetic transition, which we investigate here in a more realistic physical
situation, requires a low electron temperature and relatively weak electric ﬁeld, which
seems hard to achieve when the ionization is produced by the ﬁeld, see Sec.4.

The basic idea in Ref.4 and here is to consider situations in which the collisions
between electrons are strong enough to force their velocity distribution f (r, v, t) to stay
close to a Maxwellian Mf with temperature T and drift velocity w. The values of T and
w, which are simply related to the ﬁrst two velocity moments of f , are then determined by
self consistent “hydrodynamic” equations, i.e. we evaluate the integrals entering the time
evolution of T and w with the help of replacing f by this Maxwellian. For the spatially

3

homogeneous case this yields ordinary diﬀerential equations in time for T and w which can
be reduced to a couple of transcendental equations for stationary values T (E) and w(E)
E
yielding, in some cases, S-shaped curves as functions of E =
. In the region where w
|
decreases with E the system is unstable. The current and the electron temperature can
therefore be expected to jump upwards (downwards) when the ﬁeld increases (decreases).
This will occur at diﬀerent values of the ﬁeld intensity, see Fig.3:
in the lower (upper)
part of the loop the electrons will be supercooled (superheated) creating in this way a
hysteresis loop. The origin of this behavior lies in a changeover from e-i to e-n coupling as
the dominant factor when the electron energy is increased by the ﬁeld.

|

In the situation analyzed in this paper we obtain nonlinear partial diﬀerential
equations for n(r, t), T (r, t), w(r, t) and F (r, t). Their stationary solutions are the main
concern of this work. This is presented in section 3 following the mathematical formulation
of the problem in section 2. A discussion of physical situations where the transition
predicted by the two-ﬂuid model used in this paper might be observed is presented in
section 4. This is a much more restrictive domain than that given by (1), it requires
1015cm−3 for light noble gases when Ti is close to
essentially n/N
room temperature. At the transition the electron temperature jumps within a range of
several Ti, staying signiﬁcantly lower than the usual temperatures in self-sustaining gas
discharges. This determines the experimental set up we study here. The nature of the
various approximations made is discussed in section 4 and in the Appendix.

II. Mathematical Description

The behavior of the system is described by kinetic equations for the electron and ion
distribution functions f (r, v, t) and fi(r, v, t) normalized to the same density n(r, t). Under
the above assumptions the Boltzmann equation for electrons has the form4

The third term with the prefactor m/M , represents the diﬀusion in the speed of the
electrons due to collisions with ions and neutrals. The eﬀectiveness of the e-i collisions is
proportional to n and is strongly peaked at small speeds. The constant b is given4,11 by
b = 4πe4L/m2 (L

respectively the eﬀects of e-i and e-n collisions on the angular parts of electron velocities

as the sphericalized average of f (r, v, t).

For simplicity we have written the e-i and e-n collision terms when ions and neutrals
have approximately the same mass M . In the case of using an easily ionized impurity these
collision terms have to be modiﬁed in an obvious way. However, as long as the density of
these impurities is of order of n, and n/N << 1, we do not expect them to substantially
aﬀect our result. Finally the last term Q[f ] represents e-e collisions. We do not specify
here the exact form of this term (although we have in mind a Landau form10,11,12), since
it conserves the hydrodynamical moments corresponding to density, mean velocity and
kinetic energy which we are going to derive from (3).

We could but do not write down a similar kinetic equation for the ions. As already
mentioned we assume them to have a distribution close to a Maxwellian with a uniform
temperature Ti, equal to that of the neutrals. The assumption of charge neutrality further
implies that both electrons and ions have the same density

n(r, t) =

f (r, v,t)d3v =

and the same radial drift velocity, as we shall see in the next section. The maintenance
of this quasi-neutrality is the task of the radial ambipolar ﬁeld F (r). The eﬀect of
recombination at the wall and other wall eﬀects will be discussed in the next section.

III. Hydrodynamic Description

Many properties of the plasma can be expressed in terms of the ﬁrst few velocity
moments of f and fi. To obtain these we multiply (2) by 1, v, v2 and integrate over v. This
= w(r, t)
yields expressions for the time derivatives of the density n(r, t), drift velocity
= 3kT (r, t)/m + w2(r, t) which however involve unknown integrals over f . To
and
obtain a closed set of hydrodynamical equations we follow the procedure in Refs.4,5, which
is often used for collisional plasmas, and compute all integrals over v with the help of the
replacement

is a local Maxwellian with the same r and t dependent ﬁrst moments, n, w,
This assumption is motivated by the fact that the local Maxwellian Mf is the unique
distribution which makes the e-e collision term Q[f ] = 0 and should thus be a good
approximation (after some transient time) for situations in which Q[f ] is the dominant
term in determining the shape of the distribution function. This requires, at the minimum,
that n/N satisfy (1b) and that E, a and γ be small so that the energy exchanges in the
e-e collisions are most important in determining the shape of the energy distribution of the
electrons; the eﬀectiveness of the e-n and e-i collisions being reduced by the factor m/M
which is the physically small parameter in the problem. Eq. (5) can be rigorously justiﬁed,
as was shown in Ref.5, for suﬃciently idealized models. We believe that the evaluation of
these integrals via Mf remains valid, at least approximately, in certain realistic situations,
see section 4 and Appendix.

Using (4) we obtain four equations for the electron density n, the longitudinal and
radial components of w, wz, wr, the temperature T , and the radially directed electric
ﬁeld F. In writing down these equations we shall neglect higher order terms in the drift
velocity w(r) as compared to the electron thermal velocity u(r) =
3kT /m. (This is a
good approximation when m << M , see section 4 and Appendix).

The latter will be most important when the electron density n is large and T is low. It
gives a reasonable rate in the vicinity of 3000 K for the neutral and ion temperatures.

A similar procedure with the ion kinetic equation yields (6) for the zeroth moment
because charge neutrality implies the same n(r, t) and therefore the same wr(r, t). The ion

Here U is the ion thermal velocity (M U 2 = 3kTi) and li is the mean free path in i-n
collisions with respect to momentum relaxation. Unlike in (8) we cannot, in (10), neglect w2
r
compared with U 2. We do however neglect the ionic contribution to the total longitudinal
current and assume that the ions have the same temperature as the neutrals since they are
in a much better thermal contact with the neutral particles than the electrons. We believe
that in our range of electron temperatures we make only a small error in taking Ti = const
and neglecting the ion heating. Dependence of Ti on r can be easily incorporated by adding
one more diﬀerential equation similar to (9).

The nonlinear partial diﬀerential Eqs.(6)–(10) have to be solved for the ﬁve unknown
functions F (r), n(r), u(r), wz(r), wr(r). In the stationary state the set (6 - 10) can be
reduced by the elimination of wz(r) and F (r) with the help of (7),(8) and (10). We obtain

It is well known6,7,8 that in the hydrodynamic approximation the assumption of the
charge neutrality leads to singularities near the plasma boundaries due to the space charge
in the plasma sheath caused by the diﬀerent thermal velocities of electron and ions and e-i
recombinations near the wall. The singularity manifests itself in Eqs.(12-14) through the
determinant of the linear system for the derivatives dn

radial drift velocity, at some r = r′, reaches the value

that is close to the adiabatic sound speed7. According to (8) the inﬁnite derivatives
imply an inﬁnite electric ﬁeld F (r) and hence a breakdown of the model. Following
Refs.7,8 we interpret this to mean that charge neutrality cannot hold for r > r′ and
r′ marks the boundary of the plasma sheath. On the other hand the thickness of the
10−4cm when

As a ﬁrst step in solving the nonuniform case (12-14) let us assume that the electron
temperature is constant, u(r) = u(0).
It seems reasonable to study such a simpliﬁed
problem both as a guide for the more general case which we shall consider later and as an
approximation which often yields reliable results for the positive plasma column6.

The energy balance equation (14) cannot hold now for all r

R, but at the point
r = 0 it reduces to (19), and our task is to solve n(12,13) with the conditions (16–18). For

≤

ﬁxed E and n = n(0) Eq.(19) determines u and therefore the electron temperature in the
tube. We then integrate (12,13), ﬁnd the proﬁles n(r), wr(r), compute wz(r) with the
help of (11), and using (20) ﬁnd the total current I(E), which gives the current-voltage
characteristic of the plasma. We can neglect the diﬀerence between b and g, because in
noble gases g/b

10−4.

To solve Eq.(12,13) numerically we pick a value of u and ﬁnd a suitable n(0) which
allows to satisfy (16). Eq. (19) is used for the calculation of E for each choice of u and
n(0).
In this way we obtain the functions n(r), wz(r) and substitute them into (20).
Fig.2 shows the electron temperature and the electric current thus computed versus E2 in
relative units when l/R = 0.2. Curves T (E) are single-valued for ω

We solved numerically Eqs. (12)–(14) with boundary conditions (16–19). Technically
we choose for each u(0) a trial value of n(0), compute E with the help of Eq.(19), and
solve the diﬀerential equations (12–14) for this triple. The resulting wr(r) will generally
not satisfy the boundary condition (16) at r = R and we then iterate with a diﬀerent n(0).
This search can be easily optimized, the procedure usually converges very fast and yields
the proﬁles of n(r) and u(r) for r
R. From these we can obtain F (r), wz(r), wr(r) for
a given external ﬁeld E. In addition we also ﬁnd the total current and the mean electron
temperature over the tube cross section (20). The parts of the T (E) and I(E) curves
with negative derivatives are unstable and physically non-accessible4,5, which also shows
up in the computation being extremely unstable there when we try to ﬁnd the solutions
numerically. Thus for E = E′ in Fig.3 and any trial temperature on the tube axis inside
the gap region (0.046-0.065 V), T (r) immediately jumps to a point corresponding to T ′
after a few steps of integration. This diﬃculty does not occur when we keep T = const.

≤

A qualitative description of the results is as follows:

a) n(r) always decreases monotonically. For some range of parameters a kinetic transition
takes place, n(0) is then not a single-valued function of the external ﬁeld or the mean
electron temperature. The decrease of the volume recombination rate c enhances the
transition.

b) The I-V characteristic for the total current I(E) and the mean electron temperature
show transition like behavior for ω > 60. This is close to that obtained for the model
T = const.

c) T (r) is a smooth monotonically decreasing curve when E is large; for very small E the
electron temperature passes a maximum at some r < R. This maximum is caused by the
electron heating in the ambipolar radial ﬁeld F which is equal to zero on the tube axis.
At stronger ﬁelds E this eﬀect is disguised by the external ﬁeld producing more heat near
the axis where the electron density is higher.

d) The radial drift of electrons and ions as well as the ambipolar electric ﬁeld F (r) rise
strongly near the tube walls, the latter even goes to inﬁnity in this model but the wall
potential with respect to the tube axis is ﬁnite as one can see from Eq.(8).

10

We present a few curves for ω = 90 in Figs.3,4 which illustrate the transition,
the temperature proﬁles across the tube cross section and the radial dependence of the
transverse electric ﬁeld F (r). As E is varied we expect jumps in T (E) and I(E) at the
arrows in Fig.3.

IV. Discussion

In this work we investigated properties of the stationary state of a partially ionized
plasma in a cylindrical tube maintained by a source of ionization and subjected to an
external axial electric ﬁeld E. Our calculations were done in a collisional two-ﬂuid scheme.
The neutrals are treated as a given background with ﬁxed density N and temperature Ti
while the ions were assumed to have the same uniform temperature Ti and a density n(r)
equal to that of the electrons, i.e. charge neutrality in the interior of the tube.

The assumption that the heating of the electrons by the external and ambipolar ﬁelds
together with the injection of relatively warm electrons in the process of ionization does
not heat the neutrals and ions very much seems reasonable when one takes into account the
density and heat conductivity of the neutrals and the strong coupling between them and
the ions. To see this in a semiquantitative way we note that the temperature distribution
for the neutrals is governed by the equation

(cid:19)
where P (r) describes the heating sources and λ is the thermal conductivity which can be
taken to be constant. By keeping the walls of tube at a given temperature T0 we impose
the boundary condition T (R) = T0 which gives

(cid:18)

T (r) = T0 +

yP (y)dy.

(24)

Let us consider three cases: 1) P (r) is a constant, 2) linearly falls to zero, and 3) approaches
zero parabolically. Then letting

respectively. The condition

(25)

then guarantees an approximately uniform temperature of the neutrals. In fact we take
T0 = Ti and Eq.(25) can be rewritten in the form

if, for simplicity, we neglect the eﬀects of the neutral gas non-ideality and only take into
account the heating by the external ﬁeld, P = Ej. For a typical example of the situation
considered in this paper, which will be described later in this section, E¯j is four orders of
magnitude smaller than the right hand side of (25).

The assumption of a constant ion temperature will hold only approximately. We
expect that away from the tube axis the ion temperature will become somewhat larger
than the temperature of neutrals but not signiﬁcantly so, except maybe in close vicinity
of the wall6,7,8. Since the transition we are studying here takes place when T is only a few
times higher than that of the neutrals, we may assume a constant ion temperature Ti, at
least for the majority of ions.

E

The kinetic model on which the hydrodynamic equations (6–10) are based is the
nonlinear Boltzmann equation (2) for the electron distribution function f (r, v, t). To obtain
the ﬂuid equations we have used the approximation of replacing f by Mf in evaluating the
integrals for the time derivatives of the hydrodynamic variables. The justiﬁcation given
in section 3 is the dominant eﬀect of e-e collisions. But, as is clear from the behavior of
the e-e collision cross section, which decreases for large speeds as v−4, f (v) will not be
uniformly close to Mf (v) for all v. For large speeds, the behavior of f in the stationary
not very small, by collisions with neutrals which lead to a
state will be dominated, for
Dryuvesteyn type tail of the form14 f
. Very slow electrons, on the other hand,
are strongly inﬂuenced by the e-i interactions and their distribution is distorted near v = 0
also. However, since we are only interested in the evaluation of averages of quantities which
are not too peaked at very slow or very high speeds, the main contribution will come from
typical values of v, v
3kT /m, where the bulk of electrons are. In this region of
velocity space f will be close to Mf whenever the “relaxation time” τee associated with
e-e collisions is small compared with other relaxation times in the problem which would
try to drive the electron distribution away from a local Maxwellian. We now evaluate the
diﬀerent relaxation times for typical electrons in the spirit of plasma kinetic theory11,12.
The frequency of e-e collisions1 is bn/u3 so τee, the time of energy and momentum

The relaxation time of the newly created electrons, whose mean speed v0 is higher than u,
can be obtained from (26) by replacing u with v0 = Θ1/2u. On the other hand an electron
with speed v loses, in a collision with a slow ion having velocity ui, a fraction 2m/M of its
−1, so the e-i energy
energy. Such collisions take place with frequency, νei = bn/u3 = τee
relaxation time is

By the same reasoning, the energy relaxation time with neutrals, where the collision
frequency νen is v/l, is

τei ∼

(27)

τee.

τen ≈

M/mνen = M l/mu.

We thus always have τee/τei = m/M << 1 and the requirement that τee/τen << 1 is
just the left side inequality in (1a). This assures that e-e collisions will play a dominant role

(26)

(28)

12

in determining the energy distribution of the electrons, at least for the case of a uniform
plasma with ﬁxed electron density n, considered in Refs.3-5. In the present case we also
have to consider the electron lifetimes relative to recombination in the bulk, τB, and on
the wall τW . A simple calculation yields

We note here however that in order to get M

Mf with both T and w determined by
the hydrodynamic equations, one actually needs to assume also that τee is small compared
to the momentum relaxation times, i.e. that (τeeνei) and (τeeνen) are small. This was
assumed for the simpliﬁed model equations5 but clearly does not hold in the plasma. A
f , a local
better approximation scheme to solving (2) would therefore be to take f
Maxwellian with mean drift w = 0. The leading corrections to this Maxwellian would be
m/M , and would have to be computed from a linearization of (2) about M 0
f .
of order
The result would then be the input for the self-consistent evaluation of T . This is what
was essentially done heuristically and approximately in Ref.4. To make the scheme work
rigorously the eﬀective strength of E and hence w must also be of this order. This is indeed
m/M . In fact the results
what we ﬁnd here, for the range of E in Figs. 1–3, with w/u
obtained in Ref.4 are qualitatively similar to those obtained with the present approximation
scheme for uniform systems, which facilitates computation; see also Appendix.

Realizability of Transition

We shall consider now, within the scheme of section 3 and the even simpler relaxation
time estimates discussed above, the physical conditions necessary for observing the kinetic
transition manifested in the S-shaped curves in Figs. 1–3. Since the origin of this behavior
is a changeover from e-i to e-n collisions as the dominant mechanism for the dissipation of
the energy which electrons gain from the external ﬁeld, it is necessary that at the initiation
of the transition, i.e. at the bottom part of the S-curve, the electron temperature, Tb,
should be low enough for νei/νen to be large. The requirement that this ratio, which
can be written as (4πnL/9N )(e4/σ)/(kTb)2, be large compared to one and that we still
have n/N << 1 imposes a strong constraint on the temperature of the electrons Tb.
Assuming a Helium plasma with the neutrals and ions at room temperature, Ti = 3000K,
0/v2
R = 1cm, θ = (v2

exceed 4mA. For a Neon plasma σ is smaller by a factor of 9 and so is the requirement on
the ionization fraction.

Whether conditions like these can be achieved experimentally is at the moment an
open question. What is clear however is that if we have to rely on ionization caused by
the external ﬁeld E then Tb will be about 1 eV and the electrons will never be coupled
strongly to the ions for n/N << 1. To have a chance of seeing a transition corresponding
to a crossover from e-i to e-n coupling we would have to consider an almost fully ionized
plasma in which the remaining neutrals would prevent the runaway eﬀect caused by the
external ﬁeld E when only e-e and e-i collisions are considered, (see Ref.11).

To gain a better understanding of the dynamics involved in this non-equilibrium
kinetic transition, let us analyze, in simple physical terms, the stationary state of our
system in the presence of the electric ﬁeld E. We assume as before that in each e-i
or e-n collision the fraction of energy lost is 2m/M and the direction of motion of the
eE an electron between
colliding electron is randomized. Under the action of the force
eEτ /m, where the mean time
two successive collisions changes its velocity from v to v
of the free ﬂight, is

We see from (33) that u(E) is not a monotone function when q = bnl/v4
is larger than
i
about 12. This gives in a simpliﬁed form the origin of the kinetic transition. For this
analysis to be reasonable the energies of the electrons must not be spread out too much,
i.e. the bulk of electrons must have their speeds close to u. The e-e collisions provide
the nonlinear cooperative coupling which brings about this condition. In the cylindrical
plasma conﬁned in a tube which was studied here the critical value of q is found very close
to 10 for plasma parameters used in Figs.1–3.

An S-shaped T (E) or in other words a non-monotone behavior of the function E(u)
is caused by the decreasing term bn/u3 in (33). The recombination of electrons near
the tube walls makes the density n a decreasing function of u, due to the growth of the
charged particle mobility with temperature and therefore enhances the observation of our
transition. The opposite role is played by the volume recombination whose rate decreases

(32)

(33)

with the electron temperature (u here) and leads to a rise of density with u. We thus have
a competition between these processes in the cylindrical geometry and may anticipate that
the smaller is the bulk recombination the easier would be an experiment.

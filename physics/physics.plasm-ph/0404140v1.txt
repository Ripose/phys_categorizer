Space charge limited ﬂow of a thin electron beam conﬁned by a strong magnetic ﬁeld

An approximate analytic theory is developed and implemented numerically for calculating the space
charge limited current and electric ﬁeld of a thin cylindrical beam or current sheet between two wide
parallel electrodes. The ﬂow is conﬁned by a suﬃciently strong magnetic ﬁeld. Assuming that the
potential and current density are almost homogeneous in the direction transversal to the ﬂow we
compute the beam current and proﬁle by a variational method. We ﬁnd that the average current
density scales as the reciprocal of the beam width when the latter becomes very small. The total
cylindrical beam current thus decreases proportionly to its diameter while the total current of a
sheet becomes almost independent of the width in this regime.

1. Introduction

2.Formulation of problem.

Space charge limited electron ﬂow in two and three
dimensions presents a diﬃcult nonlinear mathematical
problem whose solution is important for many practical
applications. In the design of high power electron beams
[1-4] the one dimensional Child-Langmuir limit (CLL)
[5] has been a benchmark for almost a century but cor-
rections have to be made for the “current wings” near
the boundaries of the ﬂow. Consequently the current of
narrow beams [6-8] show great divergences from CLL.

≪

In a previous article [9] we considered a planar emitting
region whose width 2a is much larger than the cathode-
anode distance (1 in our dimensionless units). In the case
of narrow beams, 2a
1, considered here, the moderate
variations of the potential in the transversal direction will
be used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We
assume that the two parallel electrodes are large enough
for the electric ﬁeld to be homogeneous far away from
the beam. A magnetic ﬁeld directed along the y-axis
keeps the current, which is emitted either by a long nar-
row straight strip or a circular disk, perpendicular to the
electrodes without spreading out as shown in Fig. 1.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we
set up the problem and solve the Laplace equation for
the vacuum ﬁeld outside the current sheet. This solution
serves as a boundary condition to derive a closed equation
for the potential and current in the space charge region
using the continuity of the electric ﬁeld. In section 3 we
specialize to the case of narrow beams and make certain
approximations. We then solve the approximate problem
iteratively in section 4 using a direct variational method.
The results are presented in section 5. We also consider
there the asymptotics of the current density in the limit
0. In section 6 we extend our approach to cylindrical
a
current beams. Section 7 is devoted to a discussion of
results.

We will use dimensionless units: linear sizes are mea-
sured as fractions of the inter-electrode distance D, the
potential φ(x, y) is given as a fraction of the inter-
electrode voltage V , and the current density j(x) is in
the units of the Child-Langmuir current density j0 =
V 3/2√2e/9πD2√m, obtained in the limit a =

and m are the electron charge and mass.

To solve (10) numerically we write ψ in the form

cmfm(y),

(15)

where the fm are a set of twice diﬀerentiable functions
with the properties fm(0) = f ′
m(0) = fm(1) = 0, m =

their derivatives are generally divergent. On the other
hand if the error in a small neighborhood of these points
is not large their overall impact on e(y), 0 < y < 1 is not
signiﬁcant. To eliminate these regions in computing Φ we
0.99 in (18). We monitor the
set ymin ≈
validity of our algorithm by two indicators: (1) the mini-
mum value of Φ after the iterations get stabilized and (2)
by deviations of the left part of Eq. (10) multiplied by
ψ(y)/4a from the current j, at y = 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9. For
9
ﬂexibility in approximating ψ(y) and in order to keep the
matrix of the system (19) away from any degeneracy we
choose for fm(y), m = 2, 3, ..., 10 a set of partially over-
lapping functions of ﬁnite support. The function f1(y)
which corrects the CLL f0(y) for small y is taken of the
form e−βyy4/3 with β

−
To carry out our scheme practically we calculate in ad-
vance the partial electric ﬁelds em(y) on a homogeneous
grid of 1000 points and then apply the iterations. These
usually converge rapidly (after less than 10 steps) while
each iteration takes a very short time. Some series con-
verge rather slowly (as k−4/3), but even for a precision of
10−9, i.e about 105 terms in the series, the computation
of all partial ﬁelds is very fast.

After ﬁnding ψ(y) and e(y) the same, but much sim-
pler, procedure can be applied for evaluating the parame-
ters η and ξ in (12). We use for Eq.(13) the least squares
method, where the weight function in the functional is
chosen in such a way as to eliminate the derivatives of
e(y), and the computation is done around the middle of
the beam.

For computing em(y), m = 0, 1, .., n, we use (6) with the
coeﬃcients, given by (5),

The current density behaves like j

5.4/a and there-
fore the total beam current becomes proportional to a,
when a
1. The prefactor for cylindrical beams is sig-
niﬁcantly higher than the one for current sheets because
in this case the electron ﬂow is completely surrounded
by the vacuum ﬁeld, but a compact expression like (21)
for the limiting parameter λ and the boundary potential
ψ is impossible here. The proﬁles of the current density
and potential are ﬂatter than in the current sheet.

7. Discussion

As already noted the current density j scales approx-
imately as a−1 and thus will be large when the beam
is narrow with the total current of the sheet becoming
independent of the sheet thickness (provided by the un-
limited emissivity of the cathode). The current density
grows slightly near the beam boundaries, but even for
the ﬂat sheet whose thickness is 0.4, which is not small,
this rise is less than 10% (the evaluation of this quantity
is more reliable for a < 0.1). On the other hand when

4

y is small the potential across the beam width varies
much stronger. In Fig.2 we show the electric ﬁeld e(y)
for a = 0.1 and the maximum deviation ζ(y) (14) of the
equipotential surface from the horizontal for a = 0.1 and
a = 0.02.

diﬀerential equations similar to (10) and (13). The ad-
vantage of the scheme used here for narrow beams is the
transparent relationship between the exact Eq.(9) and
our main Eq.(10) which is approximate for a
= 0 but
becomes exact, see (20), when a

When a

lution of (21). This function does not diﬀer too much
from y4/3. Only when y is small does ψ(y) increase sub-
stantially. It has also an irregular behavior near y = 1
where ψ′′(y)

The equipotential surfaces deviate from horizontal
planes only when y is small (in the case of a = 0.01
this eﬀect is of lower order). Clearly our method of com-
putation, which neglects the x-derivatives higher than 2,
is not accurate near y = 0 where the electron density has
a complicated structure in the x-direction. We believe
nevertheless (see discussion in part 6) that these short
intervals do not play a crucial role because the current
is limited by the whole space charge distributed between
the electrodes.

There is a simple generalization of the parabolic shape
assumption used in (11),(12) for φ and j(x) for larger a
[11]. This uses for the approximate solution of Eq.(1) the
following ansatz

φ(x, y) = ψ(y) + e(y)w(x), j(x) = j[η

Abstract

Creation of angular momentum in a relativistic electron-positron plasma is explored. It is shown

that a chain of angular momentum carrying vortices is a robust asymptotic state sustained by the

generalized nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation characteristic to the system. The results may suggest

a possible electromagnetic origin of angular momenta when it is applied to the MeV epoch of the

early Universe.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation and related phenomena in rela-

tivistic plasmas has attracted considerable attention in the recent past. From the nonthermal

emission of the high-energy radiation coming from a variety of compact astrophysical objects

it has become possible to deduce the presence of a population of relativistic electrons in the

plasma created in the dense radiation ﬁelds of those sources [1]. The principal components

of these plasmas could be either relativistic electrons and nonrelativistic ions (protons), or

relativistic electron-positron (e-p) pairs.

Relativistic e-p dominated plasmas may be created in a variety of astrophysical situations.

The e-p plasmas are likely to be found in pulsar magnetospheres [2], in the bipolar outﬂows

(jets) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) [3], and at the center of our own Galaxy [4]. The

presence of e-p plasma is also argued in the MeV epoch of the early Universe. In the standard

cosmological model, temperatures in the MeV range (T

1MeV) prevail up to times

1010K

−

∼

t = 1sec after the Big Bang [5]. In this epoch, the main constituent of the Universe is the

relativistic e-p plasma in equilibrium with photons, neutrinos, and antineutrinos.

Contemporary progress in the development of super strong laser pulses with intensities
1021−23W/cm

has also made it possible to create relativistic plasmas in the laboratory

2

by a host of experimental techniques [6]. At the focus of an ultrastrong laser pulses, the

electrons can acquire velocities close to the speed of light opening the possibility of simulating

in the laboratory the conditions and phenomena that, generally, belong in the astrophysical

I

∼

realm [7].

Elucidation of the electromagnetic wave dynamics in a relativistic plasmas will, perhaps,

be an essential tool for understanding the radiation properties of astrophysical objects as

well as of the media exposed to the ﬁeld of superstrong laser radiation. Although the

study of wave propagation in relativistic plasmas has been in vogue for some time, it is

only in the recent years that the nonlinear dynamics of EM radiation in e-p dominated

plasmas [8] has come into focus. The enhanced interest stems from two facts: 1) e-p plasmas

seem to be essential constituents of the universe, and 2) under certain conditions, even an

ultrarelativistic electron-proton plasma can behave akin to an e-p plasma [9].

Recently, we ﬁrstly found dark soliton as well as vortex soliton solutions in e-p plasma

[10].

In Ref. [11], it is also shown analytically that dark soliton is the natural nonlinear

2

coherent structure in unmagnetized cold e-p plasmas. However, it is conceivable that soliton

solutions obtained in a one dimensional formulation will turn out to be unstable in higher

dimensions, which may lead to the creation of vortex solitons. Since dark and vortex solitons

are asymptotically nonvanishing, they have received much less attention than their localized

cousins due to the generally accepted requirement that the ﬁelds be localized in physical

system. However, in recent experiments studying laser ﬁeld dynamics in diﬀerent kinds of

optical media, it was demonstrated that dark and vortex solitons can be readily created as

superimpositions upon a localized ﬁeld background [12]. Vortex soliton solutions are also

found in imperfect Bose gas in the superﬂuids [13], and they are extensively investigated and

discussed [14]. In this paper, we systematically investigate the instability of dark solitons

and show that it can lead to the formation of vortex solitons. We speculate about interesting

application of the vortex soliton in the early universe.

In the recent paper [10], we had developed an argument for the creation of domains of

nonzero angular momentum in the MeV era of the early universe when it is supposed to be

dominated by a plasma of e-p pairs. We ﬁrst showed that in such a plasma the dynamics of a

pulse of electromagnetic radiation, with a frequency much larger than the plasma frequency,

is controlled by a generalized nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (GNSE) with a defocusing

nonlinearity. Then, borrowing a result of nonlinear optics [12] where the standard nonlinear

Schr¨odinger equation (NSE) with a cubic nonlinearity has been investigated in great depth

and detail, we conjectured that even the GNSE whose nonlinearity is similar in nature to

that of NSE will allow vortex soliton solutions with an angular momentum that is conserved

during propagation. The latter system also allows dark soliton solutions in one dimension

which are known to be unstable to two-dimensional (2d) perturbations and eventually evolve

to 2d vortex chains.

In this paper we demonstrate that the arguments given in Ref. [10] are actually borne

out by the direct solutions of the derived GNSE. We begin by analytically showing that the

1d dark solitons of the GNSE are, indeed, unstable to 2d perturbations. In the process,

we derive the instability criterion which agrees with the numerical solution of the linearized

system.

The main part of the demonstration, however, comes from a numerical simulation of our

GNSE. Starting from a broad variety of initial conditions, we ﬁnd the eventual emergence

of angular momentum carrying vortex solitons. That is, the stipulated solitonic structures

3

are readily accessible within the framework of this general equation with a nonlinearity

more complicated than that of NSE. Thus we can state with much greater conﬁdence that

electromagnetism, operative in the MeV era, could easily be the primordial source of angular

momentum associated with various structures of the observable universe.

We again stress that the present results are quite general in the nonlinear dynamics in

an electron positron plasma.

The low frequency motion of the plasma is driven by the ponderomotive pressure [
∼
(pe,p)2] of the high-frequency EM ﬁeld, and is independent of the sign of the particles’
charge. It is perfectly natural to assume that the electron and the positron ﬂuids have equal

temperatures (T0e,p = T0) in equilibrium so that their eﬀective masses (Ge,p = G) will also

be equal. The radiation pressure will impart equal low-frequency momenta to both ﬂuids

allowing the possibility of overall density changes without producing charge separation. The

charge neutrality conditions ne = np = n, φ = 0 has been assumed by neglecting the small

4

inequality of the charge due to baryon asymmetry.

It is also evident that the symmetry

between the two ﬂuids keeps their temperatures always equal (Te,p = T ) if they were equal

initially.

In deriving (1)-(2), we have also assumed that the plasma is transparent (i.e.

ωe), and that the longitudinal extent of the pulse is much shorter than its transverse

A numerical analysis of the solution of this eigenvalue problem is given in Ref. [10].

Because of the absence of ξ-derivatives in (5), any pulse-like localized structure is allowed in

the propagation direction. In the direction perpendicular to the propagation, on the other

hand, the amplitude was shown to approach a constant value. Since there does exist a small

baryon asymmetry in the early Universe that acts on a longer characteristic length [15, 16],

the extent of the constant amplitude region may be considered to be ﬁnite.

Due to the single-valuedness of the vector potential, m must be an integer and A must

vanish at the origin for non-zero values of m. The nonzero m solutions are particularly

tity; m is also known as the “topological charge.” Strictly speaking, one must redeﬁne the

R

integrals of motion for non-vanishing boundary conditions [18], but such a renormalization

is not important here because of the fact that inﬁnite-extent solution is just a formal ap-

proximation. The presence of a small fraction of ions makes the physical solution decay at

inﬁnity [15, 16].

III. DYNAMICS OF ANGULAR MOMENTA CREATION

It is already suggested in Ref. [10] that dark stripe solitons are unstable and break into

vortex ﬁlaments. When the amplitude is small (
|

A

| ≪

1), the nonlinearity reduces to the

simple Kerr-type, and the vortex dynamics of NSE with such a nonlinearity has been studied

in a variety of numerical calculations [12, 18, 19, 20]. Our full nonlinearity is somewhat

diﬀerent and it has to be independently investigated. For this section, our goal is to show

that the one-dimensional dark stripe solution is unstable against transverse perturbations

in two dimensions. Such an instability causes the breakup of the stripe leading to a chain

of vortex solitons with alternating polarity.

A. Transverse instability

The one-dimensional stationary solution for the GNSE (5) has the form g(x)e−iλt (λ > 0),

where the real function g(x) satisﬁes

λg +

dx2 + f (g2)g = 0.

Since we are examining the linear stability of the solution with the least number of nodes,

g is assumed to be an odd function with a single node at the origin.

Let us perturb the one-dimensional solution by

A = (g + u + iv)e−iλt,

where the small perturbations u and v are real functions of x and y.

Assuming sinusoidal behavior, u

With these informations, we have solved (28) numerically. First, we ﬁx an arbitrary value

on the real part of w at x = 10. Given an expectant eigenvalue, the imaginary part of w

is calculated from (33). Then, the derivative dw/dx is estimated by using (31), and we can

integrate (28) from x = 10 to x = 0 by the 4-th order Runge-Kutta formula. The data of g(x)

is drawn from the numerical solution of (11). At x = 0, the boundary condition dw/dx = 0

is checked. If this boundary condition is not satisﬁed, we guess the next eigenvalue by the

Newton method and carry out the shooting again.

The dispersion relation is shown in Fig. 1. We can see a good qualitative agreement

with the analytic evaluation with the fact that the growth rate begins from zero as k

0,

experiences a maximum value with respect to k, and the mode is ﬁnally stabilized for a

suﬃciently large k. The eigenfunctions corresponding to k = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.7 for the

parameter λ = 0.5 are illustrated in Fig. 2. From Fig. 1, the mode with k = 0.5 gives

the maximum growth rate Im(Ω)

0.137. As is seen from Fig. 2, the imaginary part of

the eigenfunction becomes wider and wider as k

0, which agrees qualitatively with the

≃

analytical estimate. Since we are performing the numerical shooting in the ﬁnite domain, it

becomes diﬃcult to estimate the correct eigenvalue in this regime.

B. Nonlinear evolution

We will now present the numerical simulation of the dynamics of angular momentum

creation from one-dimensional dark stripe solitons by solving the full nonlinear system (5)-

(6). The calculation was carried out on a 200

200 spatial mesh placed in a calculation

×

box of size L = 28. The boundary conditions ∂xA = 0 (∂yA = 0) are imposed at the edges

x =

L (y =

L). Note that these boundary conditions numerically respect the constants

±

of motion in the domain of integration. As an input we choose the one-dimensional x

dependent stationary solution with λ = 0.5. It is to be noted that the photon number and
the Hamiltonian are conserved to order 10−5 during the calculation. Since the initial value

of the integrated angular momentum is zero, it is found to always remain zero (within an
error of order 10−15).

Strictly speaking, the eigenfunction in the previous section (see Fig. 2) contains cores

of angular momenta, i.e. crossings of the real and imaginary zeros of the ﬁeld due to the

periodic form of the perturbation in the y direction. Thus, the growth of small amplitude

perturbation itself does not exactly mean the ‘creation’ of angular momenta. In order to

check the real creation of angular momenta from an exact zero everywhere, we have ﬁrst

carried out the calculation with an initial condition of the form

A(x, y, 0) = α

with α = 0.9, β = 0.0875, and ˜A1 = 0.1. This initial condition is so arranged that there is no

crossing of the real and imaginary zeros. It is done by imposing a real-valued perturbation on

a complex-valued stationary solution. The zero line of the imaginary part exactly coincides
with the y-axis, while that of the real part deviates from the y-axis by ˜A1. As the system

10

evolves, we observe the creation of crossings and the appearance of vortex solitons. As

the initial conditions are changed (always starting form no crossings), the main qualitative

result — the emergence of angular momentum carrying vortex soliton chains — is found to

be fairly robust.

with ˜A = 0.1 and n = 6. The zero lines of the real and imaginary parts at t = 2 are shown

in Fig. 3. As we noted in Sec. II, the crossing points of two zero lines correspond to the

vortex centers. We initially have twelve crossings suggesting twelve vortices. These twelve

vortices, however, do not have well-formed solitonic structures since they are too close, and

overlapping.

As the system evolves, the vortices move and we see annihilations of pairs of opposite

the vortices do not quite look like vortex solitons, even though the number of vortices has

been reduced to six. Since the distance between adjacent vortices is still small, they overlap

and are not quite independent. The central hump around x

second annihilation event. With time, the peaks tend to expand to the central region and

are suﬃciently apart to look and behave like vortex solitons. By t

72, we observe the

formation of six solitonic structures as predicted in Ref.[10] (see t = 72 in Fig. 5). Notice

that the vortices disappear only when annihilated by another with opposite polarity.

80, a propagating wave is clearly seen in the region y <

10 and y > 10 where

After t >

the ﬁeld was originally ﬂat (see Fig. 6). This propagating ﬁeld is the trace of the Cherenkov

radiation which comes from the non-integrability of the system [20]. The radiation will

11

propagate away from vortices. In the ﬁnite calculation domain, the radiation will be reﬂected

back at the boundary.

When we extend the time evolution further, we observe the third annihilation event

around t

160. However, this annihilation may be an artifact of the ﬁnite size of the

∼

domain. When we carry out the simulation in a domain larger than (L = 28) but with the

same initial conditions, the third annihilation event takes place at a later time while the times

of the ﬁrst and the second annihilation events remain unchanged. The third annihilation

event is likely to be driven by the reﬂection of the Cherenkov radiation at the boundary.

Equivalently, it may be concluded that six vortex solitons are stable in our domain and may

stay forever. It is noted that the distance among vortices at the ﬁnal stage approximately

coincides with the inverse of the wave number with the maximum growth rate km.

IV. SUMMARY

We have demonstrated the dynamics of angular momenta creation in a highly relativistic

electron-positron plasmas subject to the passage of a strong pulse of electromagnetic ﬁelds.

The system is governed by a generalized nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation with a defocusing

inverse square root type nonlinearity. It turns out that the one-dimensional dark soliton

stripe solutions of this equation, just like those of the standard nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-

tion, are unstable to transverse perturbations. By carrying out a linear analysis, we have

found that there exists an instability window of transverse wave numbers for the system.

By a numerical simulation of the fully nonlinear equation, we have shown that the trans-

verse instability will yield, after a few annihilation events, a well-separated chain of vortex

solitons with alternating, singly-charged polarity or topological charge (m =

1). These

±

singly-charged vortex solitons are topologically stable and do not disappear unless they col-

lide with their compliments and annihilate. The number of the created vortex solitons seem

to be determined by the inverse of the wave number km with the maximum linear growth

rate. For the box size L = 28, the six vortex soliton state is found to be robust.

We have suggested a simple and plausible mechanism of angular momentum generation in

the MeV epoch of the Universe. Electromagnetism, operating through the versatile substrate

of the electron-positron plasma, seems to readily generate highly interesting, long-lived ob-

jects which are capable of carrying large amounts of mass, energy and angular momentum.

12

Since an initial localization of mass, energy and angular momentum is precisely the seed

that gravity needs for eventual structure-formation, electromagnetism may have provided a

key element in the construction of the large-scale map of the observable Universe.

Interaction of an intense electromagnetic (EM) beam with hot relativistic plasma is investigated.
It is shown that the thermal pressure brings about a fundamental change in the dynamics - localized,
high amplitude, EM ﬁeld structures, not accessible to a cold ( but relativisic) plasma, can now be
formed under well- deﬁned conditions. Examples of the trapping of EM beams in self-guiding regimes
to form stable 2D solitonic structures in a pure e-p plasma are worked out.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of electromagnetic (EM) wave propaga-
tion and related phenomena in relativistic plasmas has
attracted considerable attention in the recent past. From
the nonthermal emission of the high-energy radiation
coming from a variety of compact astrophysical objects it
has become possible to deduce the presence of a popula-
tion of relativistic electrons in the plasma created in the
dense radiation ﬁelds of those sources [1]. The principal
components of these plasmas could be either relativistic
electrons and nonrelativistic ions (protons), or relativis-
tic electron-positron (e-p) pairs.

Relativistic e-p dominated plasmas may be created in
a variety of astrophysical situations. Electron-positron
pair production cascades are believed to occur in pulsar
magnetospheres [2]. The e-p plasmas are also likely to
be found in the bipolar outﬂows (jets) in Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) [3], and at the center of our own Galaxy
[4]. In AGNs, the observations of superluminal motions
are commonly attributed to the expansion of relativistic
e-p beams in a pervading subrelativistic medium. This
γ interac-
model implies copious pair production via γ
tions creating an e-p atmosphere around the source. The
actual production of e-p pairs due to photon-photon in-
teractions occurs in the coronas of AGN accretion disks,
which upscatter the soft photons emitted by the accre-
tion disks by inverse Compton scattering. The presence
of e-p plasma is also argued in the MeV epoch of the early
Universe. In the standard cosmological model, tempera-
1M eV ) prevail up
tures in the MeV range (T
∼
to times t = 1s after the Big Bang [5]. In this epoch, the
main constituent of the Universe is the relativistic e-p
plasma in equilibrium with photons, neutrinos, antineu-
trinos, and a minority population of heavier ions.

Contemporary progress in the development of super
1021−23W/cm2
strong laser pulses with intensities I
has also made it possible to create relativistic plasmas
in the laboratory by a host of experimental techniques

∼

[6]. At the focus of an ultrastrong laser pulses, the elec-
trons can acquire velocities close to the speed of light
opening the possibility of simulating in the laboratory
the conditions and phenomena that, generally, belong in
the astrophysical realm [7].

Elucidation of the electromagnetic wave dynamics in a
relativistic plasmas will, perhaps, be an essential tool for
understanding the radiation properties of astrophysical
objects as well as of the media exposed to the ﬁeld of
superstrong laser radiation. Although the study of wave
propagation in relativistic plasmas has been in vogue for
some time, it is only in the recent years that the nonlin-
ear dynamics of EM radiation in e-p dominated plasmas
[8] has come into focus. The enhanced interest stems
from two facts : 1) e-p plasmas seem to be essential con-
stituents of the universe, and 2) under certain conditions,
even an ultrarelativistic electron-proton plasma can be-
have akin to an e-p plasma [9].

Wave self-modulation and soliton-formation is, per-
haps, one of the more interesting and signiﬁcant signa-
tures of the overall plasma dynamics. The existence of
stable localized envelop solitons of EM radiation has been
suggested as a potential mechanism for the production
of micropulses in AGN and pulsars [10].
In the early
universe localized solitons are strong candidates to ex-
plain the observed inhomogeneities of the visible universe
[11,12].

In e-p plasmas, there does not exist a general satisfac-
tory theory for the generation of soliton like structures by
ultrastrong high-frequency EM ﬁelds of arbitrary spatio-
temporal shape. Relative complexity of the fully rela-
tivistic equations (hydrodynamic or kinetic) has limited
their solutions essentially to one-dimensional systems . A
summary of the salient results is : in unmagnetized e-p
plasmas, high-frequency pressure of the EM pulse pushes
e-p pairs in the direction of its propagation thus creat-
ing a density hump in the region of the ﬁeld localization.
The eﬀective refractive index of medium decreases in this
region and as a result localized soliton-formation is not

supported by the medium. (The increase in the refractive
index due to the relativistic nonlinearity related with the
particles’ high-frequency motion is not enough to cope
with the decrease caused by the above mentioned eﬀect).
In Refs.[11, 13] it has been argued that localized solitons
can be formed if the interaction between the EM ﬁeld
and acoustic phonons is taken into account- the envelope
solitons propagating with subsonic velocities may, then,
emerge. In magnetized e-p plasma, larger classes of soli-
ton solutions are possible-typical examples may be found
in Refs.[14]. However, it is conceivable that soliton solu-
tions obtained in a one dimensional formulation will turn
out to be unstable in higher dimensions.

It is, therefore, a matter of utmost priority that we
explore the possibility of ﬁnding stable multidimensional
soliton solutions in e-p plasmas. Dynamics of 3D enve-
lope solitons of arbitrary strong EM ﬁelds in e-p plasma
with a small fraction of heavy ions has been analyzed in
Ref.[12]. It was shown that, in a transparent e-p plasma,
EM pulses with L|| << L⊥ (where L|| and L⊥ respec-
tively,the characteristic longitudinal and transverse spa-
tial dimensions of the ﬁeld), may propagate as stable,
nondiﬀracting and nondispersing objects (light bullets)
with large density bunching. It was further shown in Ref.
[15] that these bullets are exceptionally robust: they can
emerge from a large variety of initial ﬁeld distributions,
and are remarkably stable. In these studies, the EM ﬁeld
is pulse-like with longitudinal localization much stronger
than the transverse; the localization is brought about by
the charge separation electric ﬁeld (usually absent in a
pure e-p plasma) created by the presence of a small pop-
ulation of ions.

In the present paper we explore another mechanism
for localization - we will show that the in the pure e-
p plasma, the thermal pressure can provide the conﬁn-
ing ”glue” just as the charge separation electric ﬁeld did
for an e-p plasma contaminated with ions. We will also
deal with a complimentary manifestation of the radia-
tion ﬁeld- the ”beam” (L⊥ << L||) rather than the pulse
(L⊥ >> L||). Assuming the plasma to be transparent to
the beam, and applying a fully relativistic hydrodynam-
ical model, we demonstrate the possibility of beam self-
trapping leading to the formation of stable 2D solitonic
structures. The high-frequency pressure force of the EM
ﬁeld ( tending to completely expel the pairs radially from
the region of localization) is overwhelmed by the thermal
pressure force which opposes the radial expansion of the
plasma creating conditions for the formation of the sta-
tionary self-guiding regime of beam propagation.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

In this paper the word ”relativistic” connotes two dis-
tinct regimes: the plasma becomes relativistic when ei-
ther the directed ﬂuid velocity approaches the speed of
light or the thermal energy per particle is of the order
of, or larger than the rest mass energy. Since both these

2

paths to relativity are encountered in the astrophysical
as well as laboratory plasmas( produced and accelerated
by intense laser pulses), we will investigate a fully rela-
tivistic hydrodynamical model.

If the velocity distribution of the particles of species
α (= e, p, i, ... where e,p, and i denote respectively elec-
trons, positrons and heavy ions (protons)) is taken to
be a local relativistic Maxwellian, the hydrodynamics of
such ﬂuids is described by [16]:

dynamics since heavy particle production has been ne-
glected. This shortcoming will impose an upper limit on
the temperature for the validity of the model.. Note that
in the context of early universe, the epoch in which the
e-p plasma is dominant, has a characteristic temperature
4m0e. Since the particle masses
Tα ∼
are just a few times larger than their rest mass at these
temperatures, the e-p plasma can still be considered as a
two component ﬂuid rather than a photon gas.

The equation of state directly follows from the self-
consistency of Eqs.(3) and (4). Taking the scalar product
of Eq.(4) with uα and comparing it with Eq.(3), we can
derive dαlnPα/dt = zαdαGα/dt. After straightforward
manipulation, the equation can be easily integrated to

For nonrelativistic temperatures, Eq.(6) yields the usual

where nr
α = nα/γα is the density in the rest frame
of ﬂuid element) and for ultrarelativistic temperatures
one obtains the equation of state for the photon gas
(nr
α = const). We would like to emphasize that the
γα factor appearing in Eq.(6) is related to the coherent
or directed motion of ﬂuid elements whose origin may
lie either in an initial macroscopic ﬂow or in the motion
imparted by intense EM radiation.

To complete the picture we must couple the plasma

agation of EM radiation in relativistic multicomponent
plasmas.

The above system can be manipulated further to reveal
interesting structural properties. To begin with, Eqs.(5)-

Eq.(14), we ﬁnd that the evolution equation for Ωα

is of the standard vortex dynamics form. Although the
system of Eqs.(14)-(16) can be traced to early publica-
tions (see for instance Ref.[18]), their consequences are
yet to be fully worked out. An immediate consequence,
for instance,
is the appropriate equivalent of Kelvin’s
theorem- the ﬂux of generalized vorticity Ωα is frozen-
in through a comoving area.

For the current eﬀort, we apply Eqs.(14)-(16) for wave
processes in an unmagnetized plasma. From Eq.(16) it
follows that if the generalized vorticity is initially zero
(Ωα = 0) everywhere in space, it remains zero for all
subsequent times. We assume that before the EM radi-
ation is ”switched on”, the generalized vorticity of the
system is zero. In this case the equation of motion may

It is remarkable that in Eq.(19) the magnetic part of the
Lorentz force is formally absent; this fact greatly sim-
pliﬁes analytical manipulations. It is equally remarkable
that our equations which describe the dynamics of a hot
relativistic plasma are structurally similar to equations
used in the theoretical treatment of diﬀerent aspects of
ultrastrong laser interaction with a cold plasma [20]. This
similarity becomes even more evident when we study the
interaction of short EM pulse with relativistic electron-
ion plasmas. If the pulse is assumed to be shorter than
inverse of
the characteristic time for ion response (i.e.
ion Langmuir frequency), the ion motion may be ignored,
and the electric ﬁeld may be found from the electron part

constitutes the simpliﬁed system to which the entire set of
Maxwell and relativistic hydrodynamic equations for an
the electron -ion plasma have been reduced. An equation
similar to Eq.(25) was derived in the cold plasma limit
in Ref.[21]. However, there are important diﬀerences : a)
Due to the temperature dependence of Ge in Eq.(21), the
factor Γe and the momentum Πe are no more related by
simple relations as they do for a ”cold” case, and b) to
incorporate the temperature variation in the system we
must add the equation of state (26).

Though Eqs.(25)-(26) form a more complicated system
than what we have for the cold plasma, we believe that
many results obtained in the cold plasma limit can ﬁnd
appropriate analogies in the hot relativistic- temperature
case. Detailed studies of the nonlinear dynamics of the

Of various techniques that could be invoked to investigate
Eqs.(28)-(34) to study the self-trapping of high-frequency
EM radiation propagating along the z- axis, we choose
the method presented in the excellent paper by Sun et al.
[22]. The method is based on the multiple scale expansion
of the equations in the small parameter ǫ. Assuming that
all variations are slow compared to the variation in ξ =

Thus, as one would expect, the low frequency motion
of the e-p plasma is driven by the ponderomotive pres-
2) of the high-frequency EM ﬁeld and this
sure (
force, being same for the electrons and positrons, does
not cause charge separation. It is also evident that due
to the symmetry between the electron and positron ﬂu-
ids, their temperatures, being initially equal, will remain
equal during the evolution of the system. The relation
between the EM ﬁeld and the temperature can be found
using the equation Γ0 = const obtained above. Using

takes place). In such a situation, one must resort to ki-

value of T∞. Some qualitative deductions readily follow.
Equation (40) shows that the presence of EM radiation
reduces the temperature T0. Since df (T0)/dT0 > 0, from
Eq.(42) we conclude that the plasma density is also re-
duced in the region of the EM ﬁeld localization which is
in accordance with adiabatic motion of the plasma. For
higher strength of the EM ﬁeld, a complete expulsion of
plasma i.e. plasma cavitation can take place (n0
0);
this has been predicted in Ref.[23]. Thus the nonlinearity
function Ψ shows a saturating character with the increase
of EM ﬁeld strength (note that present model is valid pro-

We remind the reader that it has been shown in a semi-
nal paper of Vakhitov and Kolokolov [24] that such solu-
tions exist for arbitrary saturating nonlinearity functions
Ψ, provided that the eigenvalue λ satisﬁes 0 < λ < Ψm,
where Ψm is a maximal value of the nonlinearity function.
Equation (46) admits an inﬁnity of discrete bound states
characterized by j = 0, 1, 2... zeros at ﬁnite r. We con-

at Um(= 1), i. e. at the maximally allowed strength of
the ﬁeld. As a consequence the upper bound of the prop-
agation constant λc must satisfy λc < Ψm. Numerical
simulations show that the amplitude of the ground state
solution Um = U (r = 0, λ) is a growing function of λ
(see Fig.2) and it acquires its maximum value (= 1) at
0.29. The solution represents a trapped, local-

takes place, i.e. at r = 0 the plasma density and temper-

The dependence of N on λ is presented in Fig.6. One
can see that the curve N = N (λ) has a positive slope
and according to Vakhitov and Kolokolov criterion, the
corresponding solitary solutions are stable against small
perturbations.

The detailed dynamics of arbitrary ﬁeld distribution
must be studied by direct simulations of Eq.(44). We
can learn much , however, from the recent extensive elu-
cidations of the dynamical properties of the solutions of
NSE with saturating nonlinearity. It seems that the gen-
eral features of evolution are not sensitive to the details of
the saturating nonlinearity (see for instance [15, 25] and
references therein). For all such systems the beam will

monotonically diﬀract if the beam power is below a criti-
cal value (N < Nc), and it will be trapped if N > Nc and
the Hamiltonian H < 0 is negative. In the latter case,
the beam parameters will oscillate near the equilibrium,
ground state values. This oscillations monotonically de-
crease with increase z due to the appearance of the radi-
ation spectrum. For larger z, the oscillations are damped
out, and the formation of the soliton in its ground state
takes place. If the initial proﬁle of the beam is close to the
equilibrium one, the beam quickly reaches the ground-
state equilibrium, and propagates for a long distance
without distortion of its shape. The initial beam, even
when its parameters (i.e. amplitude, eﬀective width and
phase) are quite far from equilibrium, will either focus or
defocus to the ground state, exhibiting damped oscilla-
tions around it. As a consequence the beam reaches an
equilibrium with its ﬁnal power slightly smaller than the
initial. Such an evolutionary scenario may not hold for
very intense beams with N >> Nc; the beam may then
break up into ﬁlaments due to a modulation instability.
However, each ﬁlament, will tend to evolve towards its
own equilibrium state corresponding to the power it car-
ries. Thus, the ground-state equilibrium seems to be an
attractor.

Our own studies indicate that Eq.(44), with the nonlin-
earity particular to the problem at hand, reproduces the
general expected behavior described above. However we
ﬁnd that the soliton formation requires the initial beam

power to be in the range Nc < N < Nm. For N > Nm,
the multistream motion of the plasma prevents the sys-
tem from settling in a steady state.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the nonlinear propagation of
strong EM radiation in a relativistic, unmagnetized two-
ﬂuid plasma. The treatment is fully relativistic- in the
coherent or directed motion as well as in the random or
thermal motion of the plasma particles. The assumption
that prior to the switching of the ﬁeld-plasma interaction,
the generalized vorticity is zero, greatly simpliﬁes the sys-
tem of relativistic ﬂuid equations. In particular, in the
electron-ion dominated plasma, under well deﬁned con-
ditions the system of Maxwell -ﬂuid equation ( Eqs.(25)-
(26)) turns out to be structurally similar to the one ob-
tained for a cold plasma. Consequently we would expect
that results already established in cold plasma limit can
ﬁnd appropriate analogy in the hot plasma case.

We presented a somewhat detailed study of EM beam
propagation in transparent e-p plasmas. Applying a re-
ductive perturbation technique, the system of relativistic
Maxwell- ﬂuid equations is reduced to a 2D nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation with a saturating nonlinearity. We
found that if the strength of the EM ﬁeld amplitude is
below the wave breaking limit, the beam can enter the
self-trapped regime resulting in the formation of stable,
self-guided 2D solitonic structures. The beam-trapping
owes its origin to the thermal pressure (which opposes
the ponderomotive pressure) - Naturally such trapping
regimes are not accessible in the relativistic but cold
plasma limit. In the region of beam trapping, the plasma
density as well as its temperature is reduced and under
certain conditions these parameters can be reduced con-
siderably (i.e. plasma cavitation takes place).

The fact that relativistically hot e-p plasmas are ca-
pable of sustaining high amplitude localized structures
of high amplitude electromagnetic ﬁelds should be a re-
sult of considerable importance to an understanding of
the complex radiative properties of diﬀerent astrophysi-
cal objects where such plasmas are known to exist.

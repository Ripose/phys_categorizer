The magnetized discharge with dust: negative and positive space charge modes

N F Cramer and S V Vladimirov
School of Physics, The University of Sydney, N.S.W. 2006, Australia

The structure of a discharge across a magnetic ﬁeld in a dusty plasma is analysed. The dust
macroparticles are negatively charged, but are unmagnetized because of their high mass. The
electrons are highly magnetized, and the ions have intermediate magnetization. This results in
diﬀerent transport rates of the diﬀerent species across the magnetic ﬁeld. Depending on the size
of the magnetic ﬁeld, and the relative charge on the diﬀerent species, the dust grains can be the
dominant current carrier. The space charge clouds near the electrodes will then be determined by
the relative mobility of the diﬀerent species. The discharge can operate in one of two modes, a
positive space charge (PSC) mode, characterized by a strong cathode fall, and a negative space
charge (NSC) mode, characterized by a broad anode fall. Features unique to the dust particles can
also play a role in the structure of the discharge, such as the variable equilibrium charge on the
grains, dependent on the local potential and species temperatures, the eﬀect of gravity on the grain
dynamics, and the rate of charging of the grains. The dust grains can also form an ordered structure,
the dust-plasma crystal. A ﬂuid model of the diﬀerent species is used to calculate the structure of
the resulting discharge, incorporating the above eﬀects. The transition from the PSC mode to the
NSC mode as the magnetic ﬁeld, pressure and dust properties are varied is demonstrated.

INTRODUCTION

A Particle-in-Cell/Monte-Carlo (PIC/MC) simulation
(van der Straaten et al. 1994, 1997) and semi-analytic
treatment (Cramer, 1997) of the radial structure of a
low pressure DC cylindrical magnetron discharge has re-
vealed a potential and electric ﬁeld structure highly de-
pendent on the pressure and magnetic ﬁeld. As either
the pressure was reduced or the magnetic ﬁeld was in-
creased, the steady state discharge was found to exhibit
a transition from a positive space charge mode (PSC),
characterised by a strong cathode fall as occurs in an
unmagnetised glow discharge, to a negative space charge
mode (NSC) characterised by a broad anode fall. The
reason for the transition to the NSC mode is the strongly
reduced (according to classical theory) transport of elec-
trons across the magnetic ﬁeld in a low pressure, strongly
magnetised plasma. These two modes of the magnetised
discharge have been discussed by Thornton and Penfold
(1978).

There is little conclusive experimental evidence for
the NSC mode. The cathode fall is always observed in
planar magnetron experiments, even at very low pres-
sures (Rossnagel and Kaufmann 1986, Gu and Lieber-
man 1988). Experiments by Yeom et al. (1989) with a
cylindrical magnetron with pressures and magnetic ﬁelds
similar to those considered in this paper and in the PIC
simulation study (van der Straaten et al. 1997) showed
a distinct cathode fall and no anode fall over the entire
range of discharge parameters. Langmuir probe measure-
ments in a cylindrical magnetron were also reported by
van der Straaten et al. (1997) with the same discharge
parameters as used in the simulation, but the results did
not agree with the simulation results in that no anode fall
was observed at low pressures and high magnetic ﬁelds.
However, Hayakawa and Wasa (1965) reported the exis-

tence of a stable discharge operating in what appeared to
be the NSC mode. The discharge featured a broad anode
fall for a magnetic ﬁeld strength greater than 4kG, which
is considerably higher than the ﬁeld strength predicted
by the ﬂuid model and the simulations (≈ 100kG) for
the onset of the NSC mode. In order to explain the per-
sistence of the cathode fall in the experimental results it
would be necessary for the electron transport across the
magnetic ﬁeld, at low pressures and high magnetic ﬁeld
strengths, to be considerably higher than is predicted by

lated (eg Sheridan and Goree 1989) that turbulence or
nonlinear coherent modes induced by instabilities in the
partially ionized plasma in crossed electric and magnetic
ﬁelds (Simon 1963) may increase the diﬀusion and drift
of electrons, thus increasing their eﬀective transport co-
eﬃcients.

Dust macroparticles in a discharge are negatively
charged, but are unmagnetized because of their high
mass. The electrons are highly magnetized, and the ions
have intermediate magnetization. This results in diﬀer-
ent transport rates of the diﬀerent species across the
magnetic ﬁeld. Depending on the size of the magnetic
ﬁeld, and the relative charge on the diﬀerent species, the
dust grains can be the dominant current carrier. The
space charge clouds near the electrodes will then be de-
termined by the relative mobility of the diﬀerent species.
The two modes of the discharge will then be aﬀected
by the charge on, and the current carried by the dust
grains. Features unique to the dust particles can also
play a role in the structure of the discharge, such as the
variable equilibrium charge on the grains, dependent on
the local potential and species temperatures, the eﬀect of
gravity on the grain dynamics, and the rate of charging
of the grains. The dust grains can also form an ordered
structure, the dust-plasma crystal. A ﬂuid model of the

diﬀerent species is used to calculate the structure of the
resulting discharge, incorporating the above eﬀects. The
transition from the PSC mode to the NSC mode as the
magnetic ﬁeld, pressure and dust properties are varied is
demonstrated.

where we assume a constant ﬂux of dust particles, with
initial density and velocity nd0 and vd0. The dust charge
varies in the discharge due to the varying local potential.
Writing the total current density as J = Ji + Je + Jd,

and assuming |vi| ≪ |vd|, we have

II. THE BASIC EQUATIONS

We consider a one-dimensional model of a magnetron
discharge between two parallel plate electrodes, as shown
in Figure 1.

We assume a one-dimensional steady state distribution
so that all quantities are a function only of the distance
x from the cathode surface. The magnetic ﬁeld B is
uniform and directed parallel to the cathode surface. The
ions and dust grains are assumed to be unaﬀected by the
the ion and dust Larmor radii are
magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.
assumed to be much larger than the distance d between
the anode and the cathode.

The electrons have two components of drift velocity,
vT e transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld in the x-direction,
and v⊥e perpendicular to both the electric ﬁeld E and to
B, where

where E is the x-component of E (negative in this case),
ωc is the electron-cyclotron frequency and ν is the colli-
sion frequency of electrons with background gas atoms.
The resultant drift of the electrons is at an angle θ to the
x-axis given by

tan θ = ωc/ν.

The basic equations used are those of Davies and Evans
(1980), modiﬁed to include the magnetic ﬁeld and the

where je is the fraction of the total current density due
to electrons. A boundary condition that can be applied
is that the electron current at the cathode is due solely
to secondary emission of electrons caused by ion impact
on the cathode. The secondary emission coeﬃcient γ =
je/ji at the cathode is assumed known.

The second basic equation we use is the electron charge
conservation equation, or ionization avalanche equation.
The electrons drift through the background neutral gas
at the angle θ to the x-axis and ionize the neutral gas
molecules, and electron avalanches are formed. These
avalanches are therefore also inclined at the angle θ to
the x-axis. If the coordinate along this direction is ζ, the
normalized electron current density in this direction is
jζe and the electric ﬁeld in this direction is Eζ , and the
ionization equation may be written

the gas pressure and s = 1/2 for a monatomic gas. Since

region is more pronounced.

In ﬁgure 5 a magnetic ﬁeld is present, with cos θ =
0.2, but no dust is present, and the potential drop =
392V. The negative space charge region is now due to
the magnetic ﬁeld.

In ﬁgure 6 a magnetic ﬁeld is present, with cos θ = 0.2,
and dust is present with nd0 = 103, and the potential
drop = 392V. The negative space charge region is more
prominent, due to the dust. Dust charges negative near
the NSC.

The only diﬀerence in equation (9) to the unmagnetized
case is therefore the replacement of the pressure P by the
“eﬀective pressure” P/ cos θ.

The ion mobility is assumed unaﬀected by the mag-
netic ﬁeld, so we assume, as do Davies and Evans (1980),
that

|vi| = k(|E|/P )

(10)

where k is a constant. This gives a good representation of
the experimental ion drift (Ward 1962). However we note
that this means that the ion and electron drift velocities
have diﬀerent E dependences, so r is not strictly inde-
pendent of E as we have assumed so far. A dependence
of r on E would prevent the application of the analysis
used here, so we neglect it, noting that it could cause an
error in our results at high magnetic ﬁelds.

III. RESULTS

The equations have been solved for a number of cases,
using the above prescription, to illustrate the eﬀect on
the discharge of increasing the magnetic ﬁeld and the
density of dust particles. The parameters used in the
numerical examples are those of van der Straaten et al
(1994), viz. d = 2.2cm, P = 5mTorr and 50mTorr,

magnetized gas is r0 = 3.3 × 10−3 (Ward 1962).

Figure 2 shows the electric ﬁeld, ion velocity and space
charge proﬁles for a pressure of 5mTorr. The cathode is
at x = 0 and the anode is at x = 2.2cm. No magnetic
ﬁeld and no dust is present, and the potential drop =
209V. There is the usual positive space charge region
near the cathode.

A negative space charge region forms near the anode, due
to the dust.

In ﬁgure 7 a stronger magnetic ﬁeld is present, with
cos θ = 0.5, and dust is present with nd0 = 103, and the
potential drop = 524V. The negative space charge region
is wide. Dust charges positive over most of the discharge.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

A numerical solution of the electron, ion and dust ﬂuid
transport equations for a magnetized discharge has been
developed, building on previous work for an unmagne-
tized steady-state glow discharge. Understanding the
transport of charged particles across the magnetic ﬁeld is
important for modelling the operation of magnetron de-
vices used in plasma processing for industry. The eﬀects

of charge on the dust particles on the transition from a
positive space charge mode to a negative space charge
mode as the magnetic ﬁeld is increased or the pressure is
reduced has been demonstrated.

The presence of dust can create a negative space charge
region near the anode, which enhances or mimics the ef-
fect of a magnetic ﬁeld. If however the ﬁeld is so strong
that the ions are magnetized (future work), the dust
grains may carry most of the current, which will enhance
the positive space charge region.

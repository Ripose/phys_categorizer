Glow discharge plasmas exhibits diﬀerent kinds of nonlinear oscillations at diﬀerent discharge
voltages and ﬁlling pressures. The evolution of the glow discharge from its initial formation stages
to the instance the discharge becomes stable, has been studied. We have invoked various nonlinear
techniques like correlation dimension, Largest Lyapunov exponent etc, to study in its evolutions.

INTRODUCTION

II. ANALYSIS METHODS

Plasma is a typical nonlinear dynamical system with
many degrees of freedom, and a medium that exhibits
a wide variety of nonlinear phenomena such as self os-
cillations, chaos, intermittency etc [1, 2, 3, 4]. Char-
acteristics of chaos have been studied in many driven
and self driven plasma systems [5, 6]. Presence of com-
plex structures, chaos etc in the turbulent processes has
also been studied in tokamaks [7, 8] and other heli-
cal devices [9] for better understanding of their role in
particle transports. Recently, glow discharge of neon
gas in a conventional glass tube has been analyzed for
chaos, and its various roots, using power spectrum, phase
space plot, correlation dimensions and Lyapunov expo-
nents [3, 10]. This type of nonlinear system exhibits
chaotic or regular behavior depending upon the param-
eters like discharge current, pressure etc, and transition
from one state to another takes place even due to small
change in the parameters. The parametric variation of
the plasma properties may be modelled by few degrees
of freedom [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

Motivated by the above works, we have investigated
the chaotic and regular behaviors as well as their transi-
tion from one state to another with change in certain dis-
charge parameters in argon glow discharge plasmas in a
cylindrical electrode system, because such system is used
in dusty plasma experiments [17] and not much investiga-
tion has been carried out in this geometry. To reveal the
chaotic and regular structures in the plasma dynamics,
we have deployed the well known nonlinear analysis tools
like correlation dimensions, largest Lyapunov exponents
and the surrogate method.

The paper has been arranged as follows: A brief de-
scription of the procedure for estimation of correlation di-
mension using Grassberger-Procacia algorithm [23], and
the largest Lyapunov exponent using Rosenstein et al al-
gorithm [19] which is suitable for small data length, have
been presented in Section II. Section III contains the ex-
perimental setup and the results, followed by discussion
and conclusion in Section IV.

A time series of any physical quantity measured in the
laboratory is single valued. Even simultaneous multi-
probe measurement of the physical quantity cannot cover
all the degrees of freedom of its dynamics. So a time
series may be considered as the projection of the actual
dynamics on a particular degree of freedom and hence
contains some incomplete information. The incomplete
information can be recovered in the phase space by using
delay embedding of the original time series [18]. From a
time series (x1, x2, ..., xN ), where N is the total number
of points, the m dimensional vector in the phase space
can be constructed by delay embedding [19, 20, 21, 22]

Xi = [xi, xi+1, ..., x(i+(m−1)τ )]

(1)

where, τ is the ﬁxed time lag which is usually of
the order of the autocorrelation time and m is the
embedding dimension. Then the reconstructed trajec-
tory of the actual dynamics can be written as X =
(X1; X2; X3; ...; XM ), where M = N − (m − 1)τ .

Correlation Dimension: Correlation dimension of a
time series is deﬁned as the dimensionality of the space
occupied by the points of that time series. This dimen-
sion can be calculated from the correlation integral for
the reconstructed trajectory of the time series. The corre-
lation integral can be computed as follows [12, 19, 23, 24]

C(r, m) =

Θ(r − |Xi − Xj|)

where, r is scale length, and Θ is the heaviside step func-
tion. Scaling of the function C(r, m) can be written as

Correlation dimension (D) can be deﬁned by

C(r, m) = rD

D = lim
r→0

lim
N→∞

∂C(r, m)
∂ ln r

(4)

and for practical purpose, D can be obtained from the
slope of ln C(r) vs ln r plot.

Lyapunov Exponent: Chaotic dynamical systems
are sensitive to initial conditions, and exhibit an expo-
nential divergence in the phase space. The divergence

can be quantiﬁed by an exponent which is called the
Lyapunov exponent. Consider two points on two nearby
trajectories in the phase space, and assume the distance
between them to be d(0). After time t, if the distance
between the two trajectories becomes d(t), then the av-
erage divergence (separation after time t) can be written
as [19]

d(t) = d(0)eλLt

(5)

where λL is the largest Lyapunov exponent of the sys-
tem. Since a practical time series is basically a scalar
measurement, the largest λL can be calculated from the
reconstructed trajectories in the phase space. The largest
Lyapunov exponents for our data have been calculated
using the algorithm proposed by Rosenstein et al since it
is useful for small data length, as follows [19]:

If Xj and Xˆj are the j-th pair of the nearest neigh-
bor on two nearby reconstructed trajectories in the phase
space, then the separation after time i∆t, where ∆t is the
sampling time, can written as

dj(t) = dj(0)eλL(i∆t)

(6)

where d0 is the initial separation. Above equation can be
written as

ln dj(t) = ln dj(0) + λL(i∆t)

(7)

Therefore, the largest λL can be calculated from the slope
of the average line deﬁned by

< ln dj(t) >=< ln dj(0) > +λL(i∆t)

(8)

where < ln dj (t) > is the average divergence over all val-
ues of j at time t= i∆t. It is also important to note that
for calculation of largest λL does not depend upon the
initial separations < ln dj(0) >.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS

The experiments were performed in a hollow cathode
dc glow discharge plasma. The schematic diagram is
shown in Fig 1. A hollow S.S. tube of diameter (φ) 45mm
was the cathode and a central rod of φ 2mm was the an-
ode. The whole assembly was mounted inside a vacuum
chamber and was pumped down to 0.001mbar using a
rotary pump. The chamber was ﬁlled with argon gas up
to a preset pressure, which could be controlled by a nee-
dle valve. A discharge was struck by a dc voltage which
could be varied in the range of 0-1000 V. The electrostatic
ﬂoating potential ﬂuctuations have been measured using
a Langmuir probe of φ 0.5mm and 2mm long, mounted
in a glass tube and kept at about 12.5mm from the anode
(Fig. 1) i.e. at the mid position of the anode and cathode.
The plasma density was about 107cm−3 and the electron
temperature was about 3-4 eV . The corresponding elec-

FIG. 2: Vbr vs pd (Paschen curve) for our experimental sys-
tem. The minimum occurs at (1.69 mbar-mm, 251 V)

For diﬀerent ﬁlling pressures a glow is formed at dif-
ferent discharge voltages (DV). The breakdown voltage
(Vbr) at which the glow is observed vs pressure x radius
(pd) has been shown in Fig 2, keeping radial distance
(22.5mm) between anode and cathode ﬁxed. The plot is
almost similar to the Paschen’s curve [25]. Fig 2shows
that in the low pd Vbr decreases with increase in the pd,
and attains minimum at Vbr=251 V at pd=1.69 mbar-
mm (corresponding p=0.08 mbar). Whereas, In parallel
plate discharge, Paschen curve shows the minimum of
Vbr is 300 V at pd 24 mbar-mm [25] for argon gas. The
diﬀerence may be due to the diﬀerence in geometry of
the electrode systems. It was observed that the behav-
ior of the ﬂoating potential ﬂuctuations for pressures less

3

than the Paschen minimum was diﬀerent from their be-
havior at higher pressures.
In the low pressure region
(LHS of Paschen minimum) after the glow was formed,
it went through two stages with increase in the DVs:
at the initial stage of discharge, the system exhibited
Self Organized Criticality (SOC) like behavior and after
certain DV, the ﬂuctuations changed to coherent oscilla-
tions, and with further increase in it system became tur-
bulent and detail analysis had been presented in Ref [26].
At high pressures (RHS of the Paschen minimum), the
system behaves diﬀerently with DVs, and these results
have been presented here.

[Figs 3(b)-3(i)], one observed the ﬂuctuations to evolve in
such a manner, so as to make a transition from an irregu-
lar to a regular behavior. It is also clear from 3, normal-
ized signal transited to an Inverted Saw Tooth (IST) like
relaxation oscillations. It is also observed that the ampli-
tude of the oscillations increased with DVs. A complete
transition to IST like relaxation oscillation observed at
DV=485 V. A further increase in Voltage resulted in an
increase of the time period of IST like oscillations [3(i)],
culminating in a stable state at 509 V. No instabilities
were observed above these voltages.

We report the experimental scan at increased pressure.
We observed an interesting feature. The initial signature
of a distorted IST like relaxation behavior, observed in

At pressure 0.89mbar, the discharge was initiated ap-
proximately at 288V. At this particular DV, we found
irregular behavior in the ﬂoating potential ﬂuctuations
as shown in Fig 3(a). But with an increase in the DVs

ﬂuctuations. We proceed to present the experimental
results of such a voltage scan, at two higher pressures,
viz 0.95mbar (Fig 4) and 1mbar (Fig 5).

At 0.95mbar we found complete irregular ﬂuctuations
in the ﬂoating potential signals, as shown in Figure 4(a)
for an initial DV=283 V. With increase in the DV, the
randomness in the ﬂuctuations were reduced consider-
ably (Figs 4(b)-4(i)), one observed that the random ﬂuc-
tuations slowly transited to a sinusoidal like behavior
(Figs4(c)-4(e)). However, as the voltage was increased to
290 V (4(f)), the signal became quite irregular in nature.
A subsequent increase in the voltage we found onset of
IST like relaxation oscillation. The scenario of such oscil-
lations disappears completely above 293 V, wherein the

signal becomes stable.

In Fig5, we observed IST like relaxation oscillations at
1mbar just before attaining the stable state at 313 V,
which was, however quite distorted in nature (Fig 5(i)).
The window of DVs, from which a discharge was initiated
to the voltage at which a stable state was attained, was
much wider for 0.89mbar than 0.95mbar, and 1mbar.

A preliminary test for detecting presence of chaotic be-
havior in signals, is to look for a broadband behavior in
FFT power spectrum. Hence we performed an FFT anal-
ysis for the signal depicted in Figs 3-5. In Fig 6, we have
presented FFT plots for the three pressures 0.89, 0.95
and 1mbar at the respective DVs of 288, 283 and 293 V
at which the discharge were initiated. Fig 6 clearly shows

that the spectrum is broadband at the initial stage of the
discharges. With the increase in the DVs, the broadband
nature of the power spectrum is observed to decrease and
distinct peaks appears. From this one can infer that the
plasma ﬂoating potential does exhibit chaotic behavior at
the initial phase of discharge. However since, plasma is
a nonlinear medium, its properties cannot be completely
characterized by only using linear techniques such as the
FFT power spectrum analysis.

Keeping this in mind, we have invoked nonlinear anal-
ysis tools to estimate the correlation dimension and the
largest Lyapunov exponent.

Before introducing the nonlinear analysis techniques,
one should look into the stationarity of the ﬂuctuations.
This is essential because, the nonlinear analysis tech-
niques are highly dependent on the stationarity of the
signal, especially, estimation of the correlation dimen-
sion [11, 12]. The properties of the ﬂoating potential
ﬂuctuations in a dc glow discharge plasma mainly de-
pend upon the DVs, and the ﬁlling pressures. If the set
of parameters that governs the dynamics remains con-
stant, the system output may be taken to be stationary.
The controlling parameters in our system, viz. the DVs
and ﬁlling pressures can be controlled as per our require-
ments. So we get stationary signal for a long time (prob-
ably the whole day) with a particular set of parameters
and changes only with variations in these parameters.

A typical plot of ln C(r, m) vs ln r has been shown
in Fig 7 for embedding dimensions (m), in the range 2
to 10, from which one can calculate the correlation di-
mension (Dcorr) for DV=283 V at pressure 0.95mbar.
From the same plot it is clear that the correlation sum
exhibits power law behavior within a certain range of
length scale (r). Within the range shown by vertical dot-
ted line, ln C(r, m) vs ln r plots are almost parallel at
higher m (m=7-10) and the corresponding best ﬁt has
been shown by −− line in the same ﬁgure. The slope

of this ﬁt is Dcorr of the signal at a particular m. At
suﬃciently high m, the value of Dcorr = 3.73, which re-
mains the same and this may be taken to be Dcorr of
this particular signal. The Dcorr at the pressures 0.89,
0.95 and 1mbar for diﬀerent voltages have been shown in
Figs 8(a)-8(c) respectively. Fig 8(a) shows, at the initial
stage of the discharge value of the Dcorr is 3.73, and with
increase in discharge voltage Dcorr der=creses uniformly
and reaches unity above 305 V. In Fig 8(b) and 8(c),
we observed same trend with DV. However, at pressure
0.95mbar, we get abrupt increase in Dcorr (2.97) at DV-
290 V and at 1mbar these are 3.10 and 4.80 at DVs of
300 and 305 respectively.

The complexity of the system for diﬀerent DVs at dif-
ferent pressures can be understood by looking at the val-
ues of Dcorr. Higher the Dcorr more the complexity in the

The largest λL has been calculated from the slope of
the plot < ln dj(t) > vs time (i∆t) as shown in Fig 9
for all reconstructed phase space of dimension m=2 to
10. Fig 9 shows clear scaling region for embedding di-
mension m=6 to 10 within the time scale 0 to 15 µs, and
corresponding best ﬁt has been shown by −− line. The
positive λL have been from the slope of the ﬁtted line.

The positive λL have been shown in Figs 8(b) and
(c) at pressure 0.95 mbar and 1 mbar by + sign and
their values at those particular pressures where they ap-
pears. We do not get any +ve λL at pressure 0.89mbar.
From Fig 8(b) it is clear that the largest λL at pres-
sure 0.95mbar are 0.058µs−1, 0.052µs−1 and 0.024µs−1
at 283, 284 and at 290 V, and at 1mbar 0.011µs−1,
0.022µs−1, 0.022µs−1 and 0.030µs−1 at DVs 293, 296,
300, and 305 V respectively. As we know +ve λ implies
chaotic state, so at these particular DVs the system is
chaotic. We may also say that the high value in Dcorr at
these particular DVs originates from chaotic dynamics.
The +ve λL at intermediate DV 290 V at 0.95mbar, and
at DVs 300, 305 V at 1mbar indicate sudden appearance
of chaotic state between two nonchaotic state.

In order to test the nonlinearity that governs the
plasma dynamics, we have applied surrogate test [27].
The surrogate data has been generated by Phase Shuf-
ﬂed surrogate method, in which phases are randomized
by shuﬄing the fourier phases [11, 27, 28], and hence
power spectrum (linear structure) is preserved and non-
linear structures are destroyed [28].Using phase shuﬄed
surrogate method, surrogate data (Figs 11(b)) from the
original data (Figs 11(a)) has been generated for analysis.
correlation dimensions have been estimated for both the
original and surrogate data, and a Dcorr vs m plot has
been shown in Fig 12 for both the data. The Dcorr for
the original data saturates at higher m, whereas for sur-
rogate data it increases with m which is expected, since
surrogate data is random and its Dcorr should be inﬁ-
nite [11]. The diﬀerence between the correlation dimen-
sions of both types of data indicates that the ﬂuctuations
are the results of the nonlinear dynamics [11, 28].

Finally, it should be mentioned that for diﬀerent pres-
sures, we have diﬀerent ranges of DVs through which
the system reaches the stable state from chaotic state.
For higher pressures the range of DVs through which the
system attains its stable state from initial chaotic state
shifts towards higher voltages. For example, at pressures
0.95 and 1 mbar the ranges of voltages are 283-293, and
293-213 V respectively.

IV. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

The main objectives of the present study were to show
how a glow dc discharge plasma system evolves at high
pressure before reaching stable a state from its initial
stage of discharge. For this purpose, we have investigated
ﬂoating potential ﬂuctuations as a function of Dv, and
gas pressure. The result of these analyzes demonstrate

systems [7, 8]. At the three studied pressures 0.89, 0.95
and 1 mbar, The correlation dimensions are 3.73, 3.84
and 4.5 at the initial stage of DVs. At these DVs, Dcorr
with high values may be due to the turbulent nature of
the plasma, and this nature is also prominent from raw
data which are visually random as seen in Figs 3(a), 4(a),
and 4(a). Comparative low values in the Dcorr at 0.89
than 0.95 and 1mbar at the initial stage of discharge may
be due to presence of coherent mode along with turbu-
lence in the ﬁrst case. Sudden increase in Dcorr at inter-
mediate DV 290 V at pressure 0.95 mbar and at DVs 300,
305 V at pressure 1 mbar (see Figs 8(a)-(c)), indicates
towards the sudden appearance of complex structures as
an intermediate state in the process of regularization of
plasma dynamics.

that at the initial stage of the discharge, the system ex-
hibits chaos and with an increase in DVs complexity in
the system reduces and becomes non-chaotic which have
been understood from the successive decreases in Dcorr
and absence of positive λL.
In the process of regular-
ization of the dynamics, chaotic states have also been
observed as a intermediate state, which occurs in such
nonlinear system [10].

Though the system is nonlinear, we have applied linear
tool like power spectrum which may be useful to reveal
the possible source of these types of plasma instabilities.
From power spectrum of the ﬂuctuations it is observed
that the upper bound of the frequencies with signiﬁcant
power of the instabilities are of the order of ion plasma
frequencies, and lower bound is of the order of the ion
transit time through the cathode sheath. Since the mea-
surement has been performed near the cathode sheath re-
gion, So the ion dynamics near sheath and in the sheath

7

may be the possible source of the instabilities [4, 29].

Surface coating, and production of various nano-
structures by diamond like carbon materials, nitriding
processes, dust dynamics in the dusty plasmas [30, 31, 32]
etc depend on the ion dynamics at the cathode sheath
region. So the eﬀects of chaos, regular behaviors and
complex structures present in the plasma dynamics, on
the above processes may be understood from these types
of parametric studies.

1 Introduction

Propagation and electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) damping of electron Bernstein
waves (EBWs) in spherical tokamaks (ST) is usually analyzed assuming that absolute
value of the tokamak magnetic ﬁeld |B| increases inward the plasma. In this case the
perpendicular index of refraction n⊥ grows as the wave approaches the ECR layer,
[1].
where the wave is fully absorbed regardless of the resonance harmonic number
However, in addition to traditional regimes with monotonously increasing |B|, regimes

with ”magnetic wells” also occur in STs [2]. The the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle inversion
modiﬁes signiﬁcantly the whole picture of the wave propagation and damping. Since
the magnetic wells may become quite common with further improvement of ST per-
formance (ﬁg.1), analysis of such conﬁgurations is of interest for assessment of EBW
plasma heating an CD perspectives.

Consider CMA diagram (ﬁg.2) illustrating why this case was not considered in
literature yet.
In the conventional tokamaks EBWs produced via the linear con-
version of the incident electromagnetic waves close to UHR are capable for prop-
agating to the fundamental harmonic along dotted blue arrow.
If the inequality
d[ln(ne)]/dx > 2ω2
ped[ln(|B|)]/dx is fulﬁlled (it’s the case of STs) EBWs can propa-
gate along solid red arrow to the nearest EC harmonic. In this paper we consider basic

2 Bernstein waves in electrostatic approximation

Assume all plasma parameters depending on the single dimensionless co-ordinate x
scaled in units of c/ω with ω being the wave frequency. Suppose that the magnetic
ﬁeld B is along the z - axis and both υ = ω2
pe/ω2 and q = ω/ωce grow inward the
plasma.
We begin analysis of the EBW behavior assuming validity of the electrostatic approx-
imation. Then the dispersion relation is

where ε ≡ (niεiknk) /n2 is the longitudinal dielectric function, εik - the plasma dielectric
tensor elements, n⊥ = kxc/ω and nk = kkc/ω. Since the UHR is known to be the cutoﬀ
for electrostatic EBWs, one expand the dielectric tensor components εij, i, j = (x, y, z)
e = (n⊥qβ)2 /2, where ρe is the electron Larmor radius. As it will

in the whole region between the UHR and the q = 2 resonance, so that λ ≤ 1 here.
For qualitative investigation we keep only zero- and ﬁrst-order terms. Then

other one is the cyclotron resonance q = 2. The validity condition for the electrostatic
approximation is n2 ≫ |εik|. We consider here typical for STs high - density plasmas
with υ ≫ 1, then the validity condition becomes

This condition breaks down close to the UHR and ECR. We do not consider ﬁrst
of these regions because analysis of wave behavior there is the subject of the mode

3 Full-wave equation near q = 2 resonance

To obtain a traceable full - wave hot plasma dispersion relation for EBWs with n⊥ ∼ nk
and n⊥ ≪ β−1 near the q = 2 resonance we make some simpliﬁcations. Consider ﬁrst
the dielectric tensor elements εik. It is well known that the elements can be presented
as an inﬁnite sums over cyclotron harmonic number s, −∞ ≪ s ≪ ∞ with each term
of the sum related to the ECR q = s. Since parameter λ is small, we calculate the
resonance (s = 2) terms of εik up to the ﬁrst order in λ using the zero order (cold
plasma) approximation for non - resonant terms. In this approximation, the elements
εxz, εzx, εyz, εzy vanish, εxx = εyy = ε⊥, εxy = −εyx = −ig and

Close to UHR, at large n⊥, n2
⊥ ≫ υ, the electrostatic approach is valid, the ﬁrst term
in (10) dominates and we returns to the electrostatic equation (5). In the ECR vicinity,
at small n⊥, n⊥ ≪ υ, this term can be omitted and the solution is found explicitly:

Thus, in the vicinity of the q = 2 resonance, where n⊥(x) goes down with x, there is a
spatial region υ2 > n2
The dispersion relation (10) can be also used in the ”relativistic” case nk ≤ β if the
”non-relativistic” plasma dispersion function Z is replaced by a proper relativistic
dispersion function.

⊥ > υ where Eqs.(5) and (11) are valid simultaneously.

4 Wave behavior in the 2nd ECR layer

Close to the 2nd ECR layer we consider, for simplicity, as x dependent only the resonant
factor (q − 2)/q in the argument of the Z function, putting (q − 2)/q = x/l, where l is
the dimensionless characteristic scale-length of the magnetic ﬁeld variation. Using the
asymptotic expression Z ∼ −1/ξ, where ξ = x/L and L = lβnk, at |ξ| ≫ 1, one ﬁnd
that at negative x outside the resonance layer Eq.(11) diﬀers from the electrostatic

equation (5) only by a constant factor in the right-hand side.
at |ξ| ∼ 1 the function Z is a complex function with |Z| ∼ 1 and Re(Z) ∼ Im(Z).

the resonance layer where |n⊥| grows. Suppose now that inequality (12) is satisﬁed and
consider solution to Eq.(11) inside the resonance layer. This solution in a parameter
free form

Note that the waves under consideration have their phase and group velocities direct-
ed oppositely. Therefore, the incident wave has asymptotically a negative n⊥ in the
propagation region x < 0. This wave is described by the N = −Z −1/2 dispersion curve.
At large positive x this mode vanishes exponentially. The second brunch describes the
wave reﬂected from the ECR. This mode grows exponentially in the non propagation
region |x| ≫ L.Three important conclusions can be drawn from this analysis. First,
incoming waves incident on the ECR layer from the high-ﬁeld side are not converted
in the resonance region into outgoing EBWs with large n⊥ propagating on the low
ﬁeld side of the ECR. Instead, the incident waves become non-propagating beyond the
resonance layer. Second, two eﬀects are simultaneously responsible for Im (n⊥): the

ECR damping and the wave transition into the non-propagation region. These two
contribution can not be separated. Finally, since the function |Z(ξ)−1| has no zeros
at ﬁnite |ξ|, two brunches of the dispersion curves are separated in the whole complex
x plane. As a result, reﬂection from the ECR layer can only be due to approximate
nature of the WKB theory.

5 Reﬂection from ECR layer

We analyze reﬂection of EBWs from the q = 2 cyclotron resonance with the use of
the model wave equation obtained from the dispersion relation (13) by replacement

where a is an arbitrary constant. As it has been mentioned before, U1 and U2 represent
incoming and outgoing waves, respectively. The solution to Eq.(14) describing the ECR
damping and reﬂection of the wave incident from the high-ﬁeld side vanishes at |x| ≫ L
and has the asymptotic form

U = U1 + RU2
at x < 0,|x| ≫ L. Here R is a constant and the quantity |R|2 is the energy reﬂection

agreement is demonstrated. Note in conclusion that standard ray tracing method
using the full wave dispersion relation or the approximate dispersion relation (11) can
be used for high-ﬁeld side propagation only if the wave is damped in the periphery of
the ECR, where Im(n⊥) ≪ Re(n⊥). Otherwise the wave penetrates into the region of
strong cyclotron damping where the ray tracing method is inapplicable.

6 Summary

Existence of EBWs in the region between the UHR and ECR requires inhomogeneous
plasma density.
Waves in this region are adequately described by the approximate full-wave dispersion
relation (10). Incoming waves incident on the ECR layer from the high-ﬁeld side are
not converted in the resonance region into outgoing EBWs propagating on the low
ﬁeld side of the ECR. Instead, the incident waves become non-propagating beyond the
resonance layer.
Decreasing of the wave amplitude within ECR layer is due to combine eﬀect of the
ECR damping and non-propagation.
In the WKB approximation, the waves are fully damped in the ECR layer. Reﬂection
from the ECR layer is only due to approximate nature of the WKB theory.
Standard ray tracing method can be used for high-ﬁeld side propagation only if the
wave is damped in the periphery of the ECR layer. Otherwise the wave penetrates in-
to the region of strong cyclotron damping where the ray tracing method is inapplicable.

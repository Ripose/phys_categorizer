Abstract

Magnetosonic waves propagating perpendicular to an external magnetic ﬁeld are studied
with attention to the eﬀect of multiple ion species. First, power spectra of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctu-
ations and autocorrelation functions in thermal equilibrium plasmas are numerically obtained.
In a multi-ion-species plasma, besides ω
kvA mode, numerous waves are present near many
diﬀerent ion cyclotron frequencies. The autocorrelation function of the quasi-mode consisting of
these waves is not recovered to its initial value, owing to the phase mixing of these waves. Next,
with particle simulations, evolution of a macroscopic perpendicular disturbance is investigated.
In a multi-ion-species plasma, this disturbance is damped. The energy is transferred to from
the magnetic ﬁeld to the ions.

1. Introduction

The presence of multiple ion species introduces many interesting eﬀects on magnetosonic
waves [1-7]. For instance, in a two-ion-species plasma, the magnetosonic wave is split into two
modes. Nonlinear pulses of these modes are damped, even when they propagate perpendicular
to the magnetic ﬁeld [5-7]. The damping is due to energy transfer from the pulse to heavy ions
[8,9]. Periodic waves are not damped even in this case. However, the collective behavior of these
waves in a multi-ion-species plasma would be diﬀerent from that in a single-ion-species plasma.
Recently, a study has been made on collective behavior of ion Bernstein waves in thermal-
equilibrium plasmas with multiple ion species [10]. Each perpendicular ion Bernstein wave with
ω
nΩi is undamped in a collisionless plasma [11], where Ωi is the ion cyclotron frequency and
n is the integer. In a single-ion-species plasma, the autocorrelation function of the quasi-mode
consisting of these waves shows periodic behavior with time period 2π/Ωi. On the other hand, in
a multi-ion-species plasma, the autocorrelation function is initially damped and is not recovered.
This is caused by the phase mixing of numerous waves excited at the harmonics of many diﬀerent
ion cyclotron frequencies. This damping mechanism could be important in space plasmas where
many ion species exist, with each species having many diﬀerent ionic charge states.

In this paper, we study perpendicular magnetosonic waves in thermal-equilibrium, multi-ion-
species plasmas where each particle species has its own Maxwellian velocity distribution. We
assume that all the ion species have an equal temperature, while electrons can have a diﬀerent
temperature because relaxation time between electrons and ions via collisions is very long.

In Sec. 2, we numerically calculate power spectra and autocorrelation functions of magnetic
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations due to the magnetosonic waves. In a single-ion-species plasma, the autocorre-
lation function is not damped, because the wave with ω
kvA is dominant mode. Here, vA is
the Alfv´en speed and k is the perpendicular wavenumber. On the other hand, in a multi-ion-
species plasma, besides this mode, numerous waves are present near many diﬀerent ion cyclotron
frequencies. Owing to the phase mixing of these waves, the autocorrelation function does not
return its initial value. In Sec. 3, evolution of a macroscopic disturbance and associated energy
transport are studied by particle simulations. In a multi-ion-species plasma, the macroscopic
disturbance is damped, and the energy is transferred from the magnetic ﬁeld to the ions.

2. Numerical Calculation

We consider extraordinary waves propagating perpendicular to an external magnetic ﬁeld with
frequensies smaller than lower hybrid frequency; we call these waves as magnetosonic waves. The

Figure 2 shows autocorrelation functions normalized to their initial values Ck(0).

In the
single-ion-species plasma, Ck(τ ) oscillates with the period 2π/(kvA) and is undamped. In the
three- and six-ion-species plasmas, Ck(τ )’s do not return to their initial values till the end of the
calculation. As the number of ion species increases, the amplitude of the oscillation decreases
more quickly, owing to the phase mixing of more waves.

If eﬀects of collisions are entirely neglected, Ck(τ ) returns to its initial value at the time of
the least common multiple of all the wave periods. However, this time is extremely long in space
plasmas where the number of ion species is very large (moreover, each ion species has many
diﬀerent ionic charge states) and numerous waves exist. On such a long time scale, the eﬀects of
collisions must be important, which reduces

and would keep smaller values than in a single-ion-species plasma.

3. Particle Simulations

By means of a one-dimensional (one space and three velocity components), electromagnetic
particle code with full ion and electron dynamics, we study collective behavior of magnetosonic
waves in a multi-ion-species plasma. The system size is Lx = 512∆g, where ∆g is the grid
spacing and is equal to the electron Debye length. We use periodic boundary conditions. The
external magnetic ﬁeld is in the z direction, and its strength is
/ωpe = 4.0. The total number

of electrons is Ne = 262, 144. The plasma β value is β = 0.03.

We simulate single-ion (a) and four-ion (a, b, c, and d) species plasmas. We choose the mass
ratios as ma/me = 50, mb/ma = √3, mc/ma = 2, and md/ma = √5. In order to see the eﬀect
of multiple ion species with a small number of ion species, we have taken the irrational ion mass
rations for b and d ions. The charges are the same, qa = qb = qc = qd =

Firstly, we observed that autocorrelation functions of ﬂuctuations propagatig perpendicular
to the external magnetic ﬁeld are not recovered in the four-ion-species plasma. Next, as a initial
condition, we set the magnetic ﬁeld to have a ﬁnite amplitude disturbance with a monochro-
matic cosine proﬁle, δBz(x)/B0 = 0.02 cos(k0x), where B0 is the external magnetic ﬁeld and
k0ρa = 0.01(k0vA = 0.68Ωa). We then study evolution of its disturbance and associated energy

ratio is chosen to be Ti/Te = 0.1.

respectively. In the single-ion-species plasma, the magnetic ﬁeld energy and ion kinetic energy
oscillate with period π/(k0vA). On the other hand, in the four-ion-species plasma, the magnetic
ﬁeld energy is reduced and does not return to its initial value. The ion energy is rapidly increased
and then keeps large values.

species plasmas. (For the single-ion-species plasma, the values averaged over the time period
t = 2π/(k0vA) are plotted.) The magnetic ﬁeld energy in the single-ion-species plasma keeps
almost constant even for the long period. On the other hand, in the four-ion-species plasma,
the magnetic-ﬁeld energy is eventually damped.

In
the four-ion-species plasma, the ion kinetic energy is increased. Evidently, the presence of the
multiple ion species can enhance the energy dissipation.

4. Summary

plasmas. We have numerically shown that the autocorrelation functions in a thermal-equilibrium

that the macroscopic disturbance is also damped in a multi-ion-species plasma, and that the
energy is transferred from the magnetic ﬁeld to the ions. We have not yet understood the transfer
mechanism. To do this, we will further investigate with particle simulations, for example, how
the energies depend on the initial conditions or on the ion species.

Abstract

A mathematically and physically sound three-
degree-of-freedom dynamical model that emu-
lates low- to high-conﬁnement mode (L–H) tran-
sitions is elicited from a singularity theory cri-
tique of earlier fragile models. We construct a
smooth map of the parameter space that is con-
sistent both with the requirements of singular-
ity theory and with the physics of the process.
The model is found to contain two codimension
2 organizing centers and two Hopf bifurcations,
which underlie dynamical behavior that has been
observed around L–H transitions but not mir-
rored in previous models. The smooth traver-
sal of parameter space provided by this analysis
gives qualitative guidelines for controlling access
to H-mode and oscillatory r´egimes.

I. INTRODUCTION

A uniﬁed, low-dimensional description of the
dynamics of L–H transitions [1] would be a valu-
able aid for the predictive design and control of
conﬁnement states in fusion plasmas.
In this
work we report signiﬁcant progress made toward
this goal by developing the singularity theory ap-
proach to modeling L–H transitions that was in-
troduced in [2]. The results give new insights
into the role of energy exchange and dissipa-
tion in the onset, evanescence, and extinction of
discontinuous and oscillatory action in conﬁned
plasmas.

The title of this paper refers to the philoso-
phy of singularity theory [3] as applied to dy-
namical models:
that paths through parame-
ter space should be smooth and continuous, and
that parameters should be independent and not
fewer than the codimension∗ of the system.

Since 1988 [4] many eﬀorts have been made
to derive uniﬁed low-dimensional dynamical
models that mimic L–H transitions and/or as-
sociated oscillatory behavior [5–21]. All of these
models have contributed to the current view in
which the coupled evolution of poloidal shear
ﬂow and turbulence establishes a transport bar-
rier. However, as was shown in [2], the mod-
els often founder at singularities. Consequently,
much of the discussion in the literature concern-
ing the bifurcation properties of L–H transition
models is qualitatively wrong.

We examine the bifurcation structure of a
semi-empirical dynamical model for L–H tran-
sitions [8], and ﬁnd it needs two major opera-
tions to give it mathematical consistency: (1)
a degenerate singularity is identiﬁed and un-
folded, (2) the dynamical state space is expanded
to three dimensions.

We then analyse the bifurcation structure of
the enhanced model obtained from these opera-
tions, the BD model, and ﬁnd it consistent with
many known features of L–H transitions. In par-
ticular, this is the ﬁrst model that can emulate
the onset and abatement of oscillations in H-
mode, and direct jumps to oscillatory H-mode
[22,23].

is

This paradigmatic 2-dimensional model [8]
comprises an evolution equation for the turbu-
lence coupled with an equation for the ﬂow shear
dynamics derived from the poloidal momentum
balance:

dN
dt
dF
dt

= γN − αF N − βN

2

= αF N − µF .

(1)

(2)

N is the normalized level of density ﬂuctuations,
F is the square of the averaged E×B poloidal
ﬂow shear. The ﬂuctuations grow linearly with
coeﬃcient γ and are damped quadratically with
coeﬃcient β. The exchange coeﬃcient α is re-
lated to the Reynolds stress, and the damping
rate µF is due to viscosity.†

Following the procedure outlined in [2] we
form the bifurcation function g = X(F, γ), and
identify the singular points where g = gF =
0. We ﬁnd the unique physical singularity
(F, γ)T = (0, βµ/α), which satisﬁes the addi-
tional deﬁning conditions for a transcritical bi-
furcation:

gγ = 0,

gF F 6= 0,

2
det d

g < 0,

(3)

where det d2g is the Hessian matrix of second
partial derivatives with respect to F and γ.
Evaluating (3) at T gives gγ = 0, gF F =
−2α2/β, det d2g = −α2/β2. The bifurcation di-
agram showing the transcritical point T is plot-
ted in Fig. 1a. (In this and subsequent diagrams
stable solutions are indicated by continuous lines
and unstable solutions by dashed lines.)

However, Fig. 1a does not represent the com-
plete bifurcation structure of the DLCT model
because of the following generic property of the
transcritical bifurcation: it is non-persistent to
an arbitrarily small perturbation.
Since the
poloidal shear ﬂow v′ is symmetric under the
transformation v′ → −v′
it is appropriate to
introduce the perturbation term ϕF 1/2. (Note

The perturbation term in Eq. 4 represents
a physically inevitable source of shear ﬂow that
breaks the symmetry of the internal shear ﬂow
generation and loss rates. The physics comes
from non-ambipolar ion orbit losses that produce
a driving torque for the shear ﬂow. This con-
tribution to the total shear ﬂow evolution can
be quite large [24], and in fact the early models
for L–H transitions relied exclusively on a large,
nonlinear ion orbit loss rate [4,5]. However, ion
orbit loss alone cannot explain turbulence sup-
pression. Here we treat this term as part of a
more complete picture of L–H transition dynam-
ics, and emphasize its symmetry-breaking na-
ture by assigning the simplest consistent form to
it while recognizing that ϕ may be a nonlinear
function ϕ(ζ), where ζ may include dynamical
variables and parameters.

Some bifurcation diagrams for increasing val-
ues of ϕ are plotted in Fig. 1b–d. We see im-
mediately that solution of one problem causes
another: a nonzero perturbation term does in-
deed unfold the degenerate singularity T , but it
releases another degenerate singularity T s.

Before proceeding with a treatment of the
new bifurcation T s we highlight three important
issues:
1. Since ϕ is inevitably nonzero in experiments,
no transition can occur at all in the vicinity of
T , neither ﬁrst-order or second-order, contrary
to what is stated in [8].
2. Both N and F change continuously with γ in
the same direction. The fact that T is a trans-
critical bifurcation tells us that only two param-
eters — ϕ and any one of the other parameters
— are required to deﬁne the qualitative struc-
ture of the problem. The bifurcation diagram
with N as state variable is plotted in Fig. 2,

2

which should be compared with Fig. 1c. As it
stands, the model therefore cannot emulate tur-
bulence stabilization by the shear ﬂow, contrary
to what is stated in [8].
3. To ascertain whether the model can exhibit
periodic dynamics as stated in [8] we look for
a pair of purely complex conjugate eigenvalues.
For Eqs 1 and 4 the deﬁning conditions for Hopf
bifurcations may be expressed as

g = trJ = 0,

det J > 0,

trJ 6= 0,

(5)

d
dγ

where J is the Jacobian matrix. We ﬁnd that
det J < 0 where the equalities in Eq. 5 are ful-
ﬁlled, therefore oscillatory dynamics arising from
Hopf bifurcations cannot occur.

This does not rule out the possible existence
of periodic behavior arising from rare and patho-
logical causes. According to Dulac’s criterion
[25] Eqs 1 and 4 possess no periodic solutions
arising from any cause if there exists D such that
the quantity

S =

(DW ) +

(DY )

(6)

∂
∂N

∂
∂F

never changes sign. Here W = W (N, F ) ≡
dN/dt, Y = Y (N, F ) ≡ dF/dt, and the Dulac
function D = D(N, F ) is a real positive func-
tion. Choosing D = 1 we ﬁnd that

S = α (N − F ) − 2N β + γ − µ + ϕF −1/2

/2,

(7)

which clearly can switch sign. However, there
may exist a more exotic Dulac function that for-
bids a change of the sign of S. We have not found
oscillatory solutions numerically in this system.
Returning to the new singularity T s we
ﬁnd that it is also a transcritical bifurcation:
the conditions (3) evaluated at (F, γ)T s =
(ϕ2/µ2, αϕ2/µ2) yield gγ = 0, gF F =
−βµ6/(2α2ϕ4)−µ3/ϕ2, det d2g = −µ6/(4α2ϕ4).
Does the DLCT model therefore require a second
perturbation term, this time to Eq. 1, to unfold
T s?

We remark here that often there is more than
one universal unfolding for a given bifurcation
problem, and we turn to the physics to decide
which is physically consistent. For the pertur-
bation in Eq. 4 that unfolded T we chose the
form ϕF 1/2 because it is physically inevitable
that the symmetry v′ → −v′ be broken. How-
ever, there is no matching physics for a simi-
lar term in Eq. 1. Another possibility is that
T s is spurious, created by an unwarranted col-
lapse of a larger state space. This idea leads to
a suggestion that is supported by the physics,
that another dynamical variable is intrinsic to
a low-dimensional description of L–H transition
dynamics.

III. INTRINSIC 3-DIMENSIONAL
DYNAMICS OF L–H TRANSITIONS

We introduce the the third dynamical vari-
able by assuming that γ = γ(P ), where P is
the pressure gradient, as have a number of other
authors [9,14,13,12,20]. Assuming the simplest
evolution of P and that γ(P ) = γP , we arrive at
the following augmented model, obtained purely
from dynamical and physical considerations:

ε

= q − γP N

= γP N − αF N − βN

2

= αF N − µF + ϕF

1/2

.

dP
dt
dN
dt
dF

(8)

(9)

(4)

In Eq. 8 q is the power input and ε is a di-
mensionless parameter that regulates the contri-
bution of the pressure gradient dynamics to the
overall evolution. The dynamics is essentially 3-
dimensional with ε ≈ O(1), but for ε ≪ 1 or
ε ≫ 1 the system can evolve in two timescales:
1. The original “slow” time t. For ε → 0,
εdP/dt ≈ 0 and P ≈ q/(γN ). The system col-
lapses smoothly to

dN
dt
dF
dt

= q − αF N − βN

= αF N − µF + ϕF

The organizing center is the unique transcritical
bifurcation (F, q, ϕ)T = (0, βµ2/α2, 0), the spu-
rious T s is non-existent, and there are no Hopf
bifurcations. For ε ≫ 1 we deﬁne δ ≡ 1/ε and
multiply Eq. 8 through by δ; taking the limit as
δ → 0 gives dP/dt ≈ 0, from which P = P0. We
recover the same form as Eqs 1 and 4,

dN
dt
dF
dt

= γP0N − αF N − βN

2

= αF N − µF + ϕF

1/2

,

along with the “good” bifurcation T and the
“bad” bifurcation T s — therefore we suggest
that this is a non-physical limit for ε.
In “fast” time τ ≡ ε/t and, recasting the
2.
system accordingly, it can be seen that on this
timescale the dynamics becomes 1-dimensional
in P in both limits.

The organizing center of the bifurcation
problem obtained from Eqs 8, 9, and 4 is
the unique transcritical bifurcation (F, q, ϕ)T =
(0, βµ2/α2, 0), gF F = −α2/β, det d2g =
−α4/(4β2µ2), and the spurious singularity T s is
non-existent. We now have the bones of an im-
proved dynamical model for L–H transitions, but
it still does not emulate the following character-
istics of L–H transitions: (a) Hysteresis: Since
there is no non-trivial point where gF F = 0 it
cannot model discontinuous transitions or clas-
sical hysteretic behavior. (b) Oscillations in H-
mode: These have not been found numerically.
In a 3 - dimensional dynamical system it is, of
course, very diﬃcult to prove that oscillatory so-
lutions do not exist.

Evidently we need more nonlinearity or
higher order nonlinearity to produce enough
competitive interaction. To obtain multiple
solutions, at least, the bifurcation equation g
should map to the normal form for the pitchfork
bifurcation h = ±x3 ± λx.

Several authors have taken the viscosity co-
eﬃcient as a function of the pressure gradient,
but usually it is treated as a constant. In [12]
the viscosity was considered to be the sum of

neoclassical and anomalous or turbulent contri-
butions, both with separate power-law depen-
dences on the pressure gradient. We shall adopt
this bipartite form and in Eq. 4 take

µ = µ(P ) = µneoP n + µanP m.

(11)

(1′)

(4)

Equations 8, 9 and 4 with (11) comprise the BD
model.

The values of the exponents n and m are not
precisely known empirically or from theory. In
[26] µan is given as having a P 3/2 dependence,
but is also subject to the additional inﬂuence of
a P -dependent curvature factor. In this work we
take n = −3/2 as in [12] and m = 5/2.

IV. BIFURCATION STRUCTURE OF
THE BD MODEL

The bifurcation problem obtained from the
BD model contains two codimension 2 organiz-
ing centers:

cal value of β.

T l and T u are annihilated at a second codi-
mension 2 bifurcation. The deﬁning conditions
for this point are

3. Turbulence suppression by the shear ﬂow.
4. A maximum in the shear ﬂow generated by
the turbulence, followed by a decrease as the
power input ﬂowing to the turbulence is raised.
5. Turbulence generation from non-ambipolar
losses.

Finally, we note that the existence of two
codimension 2 bifurcations is suggestive: Should
there be an expansion of the system, perhaps ex-
pressing ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld, that
creates (or annihilates) the two bifurcations at a
codimension 3 singularity? In other words, does
a more complete model contain an organizing
center of higher order? In singularity theory we
persevere in seeking higher order behavior: that
is how the relationship between a model and the
process it represents is tracked. This question is
currently under investigation.

In Fig 3a the partially perturbed bifurcation
diagram is plotted, showing the lower and up-
per transcritical bifurcations T l and T u. In Fig.
3b the fully perturbed, physical bifurcation dia-
gram is plotted, where ϕ > 0. There are also two
Hopf bifurcations on the upper H-mode branch
in Fig. 3 linked by a branch of stable limit cycles.
The dotted lines mark the maximum and mini-
mum amplitude trace of the limit-cycle branch.
This reﬂects the passage through an oscillatory
r´egime that is often observed in experiments.

Since it is a codimension 2 bifurcation prob-
lem, the qualitative structure is fully deﬁned by
q and two auxiliary parameters. One of these
is obviously ϕ, the other may be any one of the
other parameters. We choose β because we are
interested in the eﬀects of poor turbulence dis-
sipation (i.e. low β). Figure 4 illustrates how a
jump can occur directly to oscillatory states, a
phenomenon which is frequently observed.

Figure 5, to be compared with Fig. 3b, shows
that the BD model does indeed reﬂect shear ﬂow
suppression of turbulence.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

A dynamical model that emulates much of
the typical behavior around L–H transitions has
been elicited from an earlier fragile model that
had serious ﬂaws by considering the relationship
between bifurcation structure and the physics of
the process. Built in to this model are the follow-
ing major dynamical features of L–H transitions:
1. Discontinuous, hysteretic transitions, or
smooth changes with power input, depending on
the degree of turbulence dissipation β, or equiv-
alently, the viscosity.
2. Two Hopf bifurcations in H-mode. It is the
ﬁrst model that can emulate the onset and abate-
ment of oscillatory behavior, and a transition di-

Introduction

Nowadays the electron Bernstein waves (EBWs) having no density cut-oﬀs and eﬀectively
damped even at high electron cyclotron harmonics are considered as the most promising
candidate to provide the auxiliary heating and current drive in a dense plasma of a spheri-
cal tokamaks and stellarators [1, 2, 3]. The EBW could be excited via direct conversion of
X mode in a vicinity of the upper hybrid resonance (UHR) or via so-called O-X-B scheme.
The eﬃciency of last scheme, as it was demonstrated theoretically [4, 5, 6] in the frame of
1D slab model, is determined by the eﬃciency of O to X mode conversion, which can reach
100 percent value at the certain parallel refractive index being constant in slab geometry.
Due to, in a real spherical tokamak or stellarator conﬁgurations, where the poloidal inho-
mogeneity of the magnetic ﬁeld is important, both the parallel refractive index is no longer
constant and the components of the dielectric tensor are functions of two co-ordinates, an
analysis of the full-wave equations in the frame of 2D model is needed. The ﬁrst attempt
to consider 2D model of OX conversion has been done a couple of years ago [7]. The main
conclusion provided by author of [7] concerning the absence of the O mode reﬂection from
the O-mode cut-oﬀ surface seems to be quite doubtful and lacks support from last two
papers devoted to this hot topic [8, 9]. Unfortunately, the OX mode conversion in [8] has
been considered in the frame of oversimpliﬁed model ignoring as it does both the poloidal
magnetic ﬁeld and, as result, the parallel refractive index varying on the magnetic surface.
These factors have been taken into account in [9], where the the explicit expressions for
the OX and XO conversion coeﬃcients were obtained simultaneously with [8]. Since the
results obtained in [9] are restricted to the particular case of Bθ/B
1, Bθ is poloidal
magnetic ﬁeld, using straightforwardly the model set out in [9], without mentioning pa-
[8], to describe OX conversion in spherical tokamaks and stellarators seems to be
per
mistaken. Because of the intensive eﬀorts are paid to provide the auxiliary heating in
spherical tokamaks using OXB scheme, calculation of the OX conversion coeﬃcient in the
realistic 2D model is of great interest.

≪

In this communication the set of the reduced wave equations valid in a vicinity of the O-
mode cutoﬀ and accounting for the magnetic ﬁeld 2D inhomogeneity with no restriction
to an angle between the toroidal direction and the total magnetic ﬁeld are derived. A

solutions to the reduced set of equations are obtained and its properties are considered in
details.

2 Physical model

There are three eﬀects that remain beyond the scope of the present paper. We neglect, ﬁrst,
the curvature of the magnetic ﬁeld line at the magnetic surface because of its local radius
Rf is considerably greater than the beam radius ρ, second, the curvature of the magnetic
ﬂux surfaces assuming high localization of the conversion region, third, the magnetic ﬁeld
shear which is not important for OX conversion [10]. We restrict ourselves to the case of
not extremely strong plasma density inhomogeneity Ln when the wave conversed through
the evanescent region and propagating inward plasma could be associated with WKB X
mode.

Consider a domain beyond the tokamak mid-plane.

Introduce two Cartesian co-
ordinate systems (x, y, z) and (x, ζ, ξ) with distances scaled in the units c/ω and their
origin located at the O-mode cut-oﬀ surface at r0. The axis x coincides with the direction
of the density gradient, axes y and z imitate the poloidal and the toroidal directions,
respectively, and axes ζ and ξ are along the magnetic ﬁeld and perpendicular to it at the
surface of O-mode cut-oﬀ, respectively. The transformation from y, z components to ζ, ξ
components convenient to represent the Maxwellian equations is

y = cos(ϕ)ζ + sin(ϕ)ξ

z =

sin(ϕ)ζ + cos(ϕ)ξ.

Since the plasma conﬁguration is axisymmetric we may assume that the wave ﬁelds
vary as exp (inzz), where nz being constant is large. We would like to construct solutions

where Bp and Cp are an arbitrary constants. Comparing Eqs.(24) and (25) we can point out
the diﬀerence between them is that the parameter γ meaning the size of an evanescence

γ−
(p + 1) for XO conversion. That is to say the eﬃciency of OX conversion

is distinguished from the eﬃciency of XO conversion conﬁrming the conclusions of [8]
made for plasma without poloidal magnetic ﬁeld and generalized in [9] for plasma with
Bθ/B

elementary algebra an explicit expressions for electric ﬁeld components for OX and XO
conversion.

4 Conclusions

In this paper the OX and XO conversions for quasi-tokamak 2D conﬁguration have been
considered. The explicit expressions for the electric ﬁeld’s components E+, Eξ have been
obtained. At the same time the explicit expressions for the conversion coeﬃcients will
enter to the publication submitted to the journal Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion.

The toroidal momentum pinch velocity

In this letter a pinch velocity of toroidal momentum is shown to exist for the ﬁrst time. Using
the gyro-kinetic equations in the frame moving with the equilibrium toroidal velocity, it is shown
that the physics eﬀect can be elegantly formulated through the “Coriolis” drift. A ﬂuid model is
used to highlight the main coupling mechanisms between the density and temperature perturbations
on the one hand and the perturbed parallel ﬂow on the other. Gyro-kinetic calculations are used
to accurately asses the magnitude of the pinch. The pinch velocity leads to a radial gradient of
the toroidal velocity proﬁle even in the absence of a torque on the plasma.
It is shown to be
sizeable in the plasmas of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) leading
to a moderately peaked rotation proﬁle. Finally, the pinch also aﬀects the interpretation of current
experiments.

In a tokamak the total toroidal angular momentum
is a conserved quantity in the absence of an external
source. Transport phenomena determine the rotation
proﬁle which is of interest because a radial gradient in
the toroidal rotation is connected with an ExB shearing
that can stabilise micro-instabilities [1, 2, 3] and, hence,
improve conﬁnement. Furthermore, a toroidal rotation of
suﬃcient magnitude can stabilise the resistive wall mode
[4, 5, 6]. In present day experiments the rotation is often
determined by the toroidal torque on the plasma that re-
sults from the neutral beam heating. Such a torque will
be largely absent in a reactor and it is generally assumed
that the rotation, and hence its positive inﬂuence, will be
small. The novel pinch velocity described in this letter,
however, may generate a sizeable toroidal velocity gra-
dient in the conﬁnement region even in the absence of a
torque.

We will focus on the Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG)
mode, which is expected to be the dominant instability
governing the ion heat channel in a reactor plasma. The
equations are formulated using the gyro-kinetic frame-
work [7, 8, 9, 10], which has been proven success-
ful in explaining many observed transport phenomena
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Because
of the rotation, the background electric ﬁeld cannot be
ordered small [23, 24, 25, 26], and the starting point for
the derivation is a set of equations for the time evolution
of the guiding centre X and the parallel (to the magnetic
ﬁeld) velocity component (vk) in the co-moving system
(with background velocity u0) obtained from Ref. [26]

Here b = B/B is the unit vector in the direction of the
magnetic ﬁeld (B), φ is the perturbed gyro-averaged po-
tential (i.e. the part not connected with the background

rotation), µ the magnetic moment, m (e) the particle
0 = u0 + vkb. For the background
mass (charge), and u∗
velocity (u0) we assume a constant rigid body toroidal
rotation with angular frequency Ω (this is an equilibrium
solution see, for instance, Refs. [26, 27, 28])

u0 = Ω × X = R2Ω∇ϕ,

(3)

where ϕ is the toroidal angle. We brieﬂy outline the
derivation of the ﬁnal equations here. More details can
be found in [29]. The background velocity u0 will be as-
sumed smaller than the thermal velocity, and only the
terms linear in u0 will be retained. This eliminates the
centrifugal forces but retains the Coriolis force. Further-
more the low beta approximation is used for the equi-
librium magnetic ﬁeld (i.e. b · ∇b ≈ ∇⊥B/B where ⊥
indicates the component perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld). With these assumptions

The terms in this equation are from left to right, the par-
allel motion (vkb), the ExB velocity vE, the combination
of curvature and grad-B drift vd, and an additional term
proportional to Ω⊥. An interpretation of this term can
be found if one uses the standard expression for a drift

velocity (vD) due to a force (F) perpendicular to the
magnetic ﬁeld vD = F × B/eB2. Substituting the Cori-
olis force Fc = 2mv × Ω, and taking for the velocity (v)
the lowest order (parallel) velocity one obtains

The last term in Eq. (6) is therefore the Coriolis drift.

where dX/dt is given by Eq. (6). The derived equations
are similar to the non-rotating system, with the diﬀer-
ence being the additional Coriolis drift. It follows that
this Coriolis drift appears in a completely symmetric way
compared with the curvature and grad-B drift.

In this letter the approximation that assumes circular
surfaces and small inverse aspect ratio (ǫ) is used. In this
case the Coriolis drift adds to the curvature and grad-B

where ez is in the direction of the symmetry axis of the

ing the ballooning transform [30]. The equations, except
from the Coriolis drift are standard and can be found in,
for instance, Ref. [31]. In the following u′ ≡ −R∇RΩ/vth
and u ≡ RΩ/vth. Unless explicitly stated otherwise all
quantities will be made dimensionless using the major ra-
2T /mi, and the ion
dius R, the thermal velocity vth ≡
mass mi. Densities will be normalised with the electron
density. The toroidal momentum ﬂux is approximated by
the ﬂux of parallel momentum (Γφ) which is sometimes
normalised with the total ion heat ﬂow (Qi)

Before turning to the gyro-kinetic calculations, ﬁrst
the implications of the Coriolis drift will be investigated
using a simple ﬂuid model (more extended models have
been published in Refs. [32, 33]). A (low ﬁeld side) slab
like geometry will be assumed with all plasma parameters
being a function of the x-coordinate only. The magnetic
ﬁeld is B = Bey, ∇B = −B/Rex, The model can be
build by taking moments of the gyro-kinetic equation in

where FM is the Maxwell distribution. Note that trans-
lation symmetry in the z-direction is assumed, eliminat-
ing the parallel dynamics. Building moments of these
equations neglecting the heat ﬂuxes (this a clear simpli-
ﬁcation, see for instance [34, 35, 36, 37]), and taking the
space and time dependence of the perturbed quantities
as exp[ikθz − iωt], one arrives at the following equations
for the perturbed density (n) normalised to the back-
ground density (n0), the perturbed parallel velocity (w)
normalised with the thermal velocity, and the perturbed
ion temperature (T ) normalised with the background ion
temperature (T0)

Here R/LN ≡ −R∇n0/n0, R/LT ≡ −R∇T0/T0, the po-
tential φ is normalised to T0/e, and the frequency is nor-
malised with the drift frequency ωD = −kθT0/eBR. The
Coriolis drift (all terms proportional to u) introduces the
perturbed velocity in the equations for the perturbed
density, and temperature. However, since u ≪ 1 the
inﬂuence of the Coriolis drift on the “pure” ITG (with
u = 0) is relatively small. The Coriolis drift generates
a coupling between w and the density, temperature as
well as potential ﬂuctuations. Note that for u = 0 the
perturbed velocity is directly related to the gradient u′,
resulting in a purely diﬀusive ﬂux. For ﬁnite rotation
(u 6= 0) the ITG will generate a perturbed parallel veloc-
ity w, which is then transported by the perturbed ExB
velocity. If the perturbed temperature is kept the expres-
sions for the momentum ﬂux become rather lengthy and
are, therefore, reported elsewhere [29]. Retaining only
the coupling with the perturbed density and potential,
and assuming an adiabatic electron response (n = φ/τ
with τ = Te/T0 being the electron to ion temperature
ratio) one can derive

Here, the dagger denotes the complex conjugate, ωR is
the real part of the frequency, and γ the growth rate

normalised to ωD = −kT0/eBR. The second term be-
tween the square brackets of Eq. (15) represents an in-
ward pinch of the toroidal velocity (the word pinch is

more negative, i.e. the pinch always enhances the abso-
lute value of the velocity gradient in agreement with the
results from the ﬂuid theory. Fig. 1 also shows that the
pinch decreases with kθρi. It is noted here that also χφ
in becomes smaller for smaller kθρi [39].

used here because the ﬂux is proportional to u, unlike
oﬀ-diagonal contributions that are due to pressure and
temperature gradients [38, 39]) If one assume no torque,
i.e. Γφ = 0 it can be seen that the pinch can lead to a
sizeable gradient length R/Lu ≡ R∇u/u = 4 (for τ = 1).
The peaking is in roughly the same range as the expected
density peaking [40].

FIG. 1: (R/2LT )Γφ/Qi as a function of u for three values of
kθρi 0.5 (o), 0.2 (squares), and 0.8 (diamonds). The top right
graph shows the growth rate as a function of u and the down
left graph the contour lines of (R/2LT )Γφ/Qi as a function
of u and u′, both for kθρi = 0.5. In the latter graph the thick
line denotes zero momentum ﬂux, i.e. the stationary point
for zero torque

Fig. 1 shows the parallel momentum ﬂux as a func-
tion of the toroidal velocity u obtained from linear gyro-
kinetic calculations using the LINART code [41] (in
which unlike Eq. (11) the parallel dynamics is kept)
for three diﬀerent values of the poloidal wave vector
(kθρi = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8). The parameters of each of
the gyro-kinetic calculations in this letter are those of the
Waltz standard case [42]: q = 2, magnetic shear ˆs = 1,
ǫ = 0.1, R/LN = 3, R/LT = 9, τ = 1, u = u′ = 0.
In the presented scans one of these parameters is var-
ied while keeping the others ﬁxed. Since the ﬂux from
Fig. 1 is linear in the velocity, a constant pinch velocity
exists in agreement with the ﬂuid model. The inﬂuence
of the toroidal velocity on the growth rate is small. The
bottom left graph shows the contour lines of the ﬂux as
a function of u and u′. The fact that the contour lines
are straight means that the momentum ﬂux is a linear
combination of the diﬀusive part (∝ χφu′) and the pinch
velocity (Vφu)

Γφ = [χφu′ + Vφu]

(17)

The diagonal part has been calculated previously using
ﬂuid [43, 44, 45, 46, 47] as well as gyro-kinetic theory
[48, 49]. The pinch velocity is negative (inward) for posi-
tive u such that it enhances the gradient. It changes sign
with u such that for negative velocities it will make u′

FIG. 2: RVφ/χφ as a function of various parameters: R/LN
(x), 3ˆs (+), q (o), and 20ǫ (diamonds), and 6kθρi (squares)

Fig. 2 shows the normalised pinch velocity RVφ/χφ as a
function of various parameters. The magnetic shear and
the density gradient have a rather large impact. Note
that both due to ˆs, as well as due to q, R/LN and ǫ, the
pinch velocity is expected to be small in the inner core,
but sizeable in the conﬁnement region.

The novel pinch velocity described in this letter has
several important consequences. It can explain a gradi-
ent of the toroidal velocity in the conﬁnement region of
the plasma without momentum input. A spin up of the
plasma column without torque has indeed been observed
[51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]. Although a consistent descrip-
tion ordering the diﬀerent observations is still lacking, the
calculations of this letter show that the pinch velocity is
expected to play an important role. This ﬁnite gradient
without torque is especially important for a tokamak re-
actor in which the torque will be relatively small. From
the calculations shown above, and for typical parameters
in the conﬁnement region of a reactor plasma, one ob-
tains a gradient length R/Lu = u′/u in the range 2-4
representing a moderate peaking of the toroidal velocity
proﬁle similar to that of the density. Unfortunately, the
current calculation only yields the normalised toroidal
velocity gradient. In order to determine the velocity gra-
dient one would need to know the edge rotation velocity.
This situation is similar to that of the ion temperature
[50].

The existence of a pinch can resolve the discrepancy
between the calculated χφ and the experimentally ob-
tained eﬀective diﬀusivity (χeﬀ = Γφ/u′). The latter is
often found to decrease with increasing minor radius and
to be smaller than the theoretical value of χφ in the outer
region of the plasma [57, 58, 59]. The pinch indeed leeds

to a decrease of χeﬀ

The calculations in this letter show that the second term
in the brackets can be of the order -1, leading to χeﬀ < χi.

Results of experimental investigation of plasma luminous
emittance (integrated with respect to time and quartz trans-
mission band spectrum) of a pulsed plasma generator depend-
ing on its axis spatial position, are presented.
It is shown
that the spatial distribution of plasma radiant intensity is
of clearly anisotropic character, that is, there exists a cone of
the plasma generator axial directions in which the radiation of
plasma reaches its peak. A possible explanation of the results
obtained is given based on a hypothesis of global anisotropy
of space caused by the existence of a cosmological vectorial
potential Ag. It is shown that the vector Ag has the follow-
ing coordinates in the second equatorial coordinate system:

I. INTRODUCTION.

In Refs. [1–12], a new assumed interaction of objects
in nature distinct from the four known ones (the strong,
weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational interactions) is
predicted and investigated. The new force is caused
by the existence of the cosmological vectorial potential
Ag, a new fundamental vectorial constant entering into
the deﬁnition of discrete objects, byuons. According to
the hypothesis advanced in Refs. [1–4], in the process of
minimization of potential energy of interaction between
byuons in the one-dimensional space formed by them,
the observable physical space as well as the world of ele-
mentary particles together with their properties appear.
The masses of particles in the model proposed are pro-
portional to the modulus of the summary potential AΣ
which contains Ag and vectorial potentials of various
magnetic sources as of natural origin (from the Earth,
the Sun, etc.)
so of artiﬁcial origin (for example, the
vectorial potential A of magnetic ﬁelds from solenoids,
plasma generators, etc.). The value |AΣ| is always lesser
than |Ag| ≈ 1, 95 × 1011Gs · cm [1–7]. The vectors AΣ
and Ag are practically always collinear because of the

great value of the latter.
the process of formation of the physical space and charge
numbers of elementary particles is investigated. There-
fore, in contrast with calibration theories (for example,
the classical and quantum ﬁeld theories), the values of po-
tentials acquire the physical sense, which is in tune with
the known and experimentally tested Aharonoﬀ-Bohm
eﬀect [13–16] as a particular case of quantum properties
of space described in Refs. [1–4].

The on-earth experiments (with high-current magnets
[1,2,5–7], with a gravimeter and an attached magnet
[1,2,8]), investigations of changes in β-decay rate of ra-
dioactive elements under the action of the new force [9],
and astrophysical observations [10,11] have given the fol-
lowing approximate coordinates (in the second equatorial
system) for the direction of the vector Ag: right ascen-
sion α ≈ 270◦, declination β ≈ 34◦.

In the aggregate, the experiments carried out [1,2,4–12]
have shown that if the vectorial potential of some current
system is opposite in direction to the vector AΣ then the
new force repels any substance out of the region of weak-
ened |AΣ| mainly in the direction of Ag. The magnitude
of the new force F in the experiments with high-current
magnets (magnetic ﬂux B being up to 15T ) was equal to
∼ 0, 01 − 0, 08g for the test body mass ∼ 30g. When in-
vestigating the new interaction with the aid of a station-
ary linear arc plasma generator (with ∼ 60kW , current
∼ 300A, voltage 220V , mass ﬂow rate V ≈ 120ms−1) po-
sitioned on a special rotatable base, there were detected
two special directions corresponding to energy release in
the plasma jet up to 40% more than the average energy
in the plasma ﬂow during rotation of the plasma gener-
ator in the horizontal plane through nearly 360◦, with
the summary experimental error of ±12%. These direc-
tions laid left and right from the vector Ag at an angle of
∼ 45◦ − 50◦ with the latter, they corresponded with the
most eﬃcient angle between the vector A of the current
system and the vector Ag (i.e. with the maximum mag-
nitude of the new force) being equal to 135◦ ÷ 140◦ [12].
The found directions of maximum action of the new force
in the experiments with the plasma generator gave the
following Ag - coordinates: α ≈ (280 − 297)◦, δ ≈ 30◦.

The aim of the present work is further experimental
investigation of the global space anisotropy associated
with Ag.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM.

etc.). All these requirements are most closely met by the
pulsed plasma generator (magnetoplasma compressor).

The new force predicted in the Refs. [1–12] is of com-
plex nonlinear and nonlocal character and can be rep-
resented in the form of some series in ∆A, a diﬀerence
between changes in AΣ at the location points of a sensor
and test body. For the ﬁrst approximation of that series
we have

F ∼ N ∆A

∂∆A
∂x

where x is the spatial coordinate, and N is the number of
stable elementary particles (electrons, protons, neutrons)
in a space region with AΣ varying due to the vectorial
potential of some current system. It was shown in the
experiments [1,2] with rotating magnetic discs and an
engine-generator as well as in the experiments with the
plasma generator [12] that the force F can be substan-
tially increased (tens and more times) when phasing the
motion of the body with the process of physical space for-
mation from byuons (i.e. the working body must change
AΣ by its own potential A and move in the direction of
Ag. Therewith the particles of the body must rotate in
phase with the above-mentioned process of formation of
the physical space). In such a case energy will be taken
from the physical space through the elementary parti-
cles of the working body. The law of energy conservation
in the system ”working body - physical space” will be
valid. As is known [17], the basic energy of the Universe
(> 90%) is determined by the ”dark” (virtual) matter.
The model of formation of the physical space [1–4] de-
scribes the phenomenon of the ”dark matter” reasonably
well.

Based upon the physics of the new assumed force and
mechanisms of strengthening it to realize the aims of the
present paper, the experimental installation should met
the following requirements. First, it should realize a max-
imum ∆A corresponding to maximum possible values of
current. Second, to realize a maximum ∂∆A
∂x , the current
density should be as high as possible. Third, if a plasma
generator is chosen for investigation of the new force, its
discharge should be maintained in a medium with the
most great value of N (for example, not in vacuum but
in air at the atmospheric pressure or in water). Fourth, to
realize the mechanism of strengthening the new force (i.e.
phasing the motion of the working body with the process
of space formation at the rate on the order of the light
speed), the magnitude of the velocity V in the discharge
should be the maximum possible. Fifth, the experimen-
tal installation on the base of a plasma generator chosen
for investigating the global space anisotropy by way of
scanning the celestial sphere should introduce into the ex-
periment minimum systematic errors connected with the
rotation of the plasma generator in space (for example,
with an inﬂuence of curvature of hoses delivering water,
air, and argon to a stationary plasma generator, on heat
release in its jet as in Ref. [12], or with action of the Cori-
olis force on the ﬂow of water in a measuring tube [12],

III. EXPERIMENTAL INSTALLATION AND
TECHNIQUE.

The experimental

installation was comprised of a
pulsed plasma generator and a system of measuring the
plasma radiation. The plasma generator was fed from an
energy-storage capacitor 100mF in total capacity with
operating voltage up to 5kV . The total energy accu-
mulated in the capacitor was equal to ∼ 1, 25kJ. The
battery was charged from a standard high-voltage power
source GOR-100 and commutated to the load (pulsed
plasma generator) with the aid of a trigatron type air
spark gape activated by a short (∼ 1ns) high-voltage
(∼ 30kV ) pulse coming to the air-gap from a trigger cir-
cuit.

The design of the pulsed plasma generator (1) is shown
in Fig.1. The case (2) of the generator (its outer electrode
being anode) was made of thin-walled copper tube 11
mm in external diameter and 100mm in length. The ax-
ial electrode (3) (cathode) 4mm in diameter made from
copper bar was placed into an acrylic plastic tube (4)
with inner diameter of 4mm and outside diameter equal
to that of the outer electrode. In the Fig.1 shown is also
a statistic average pattern (5) of discharge currents of
the plasma generator. The angle φ was equal to ∼ 30◦.
The whole construction as a unit was an analogue of the
coaxial plasma accelerator. The plasma generator was
locked on a textolite plate (6) positioned on a special
adjustment table (8) rotatable around its vertical axis
(7). The table (8) was provided with a limb (9) allow-
ing to control the angle of rotation of the whole system
relative to some starting position. The plate (6) itself
could rotate around the horizontal axis (10) through an
arbitrary angle β. The system as an assembly made it
possible to rotate the plasma generator during the ex-
periment around the vertical axis (7) through any angle,
and around the horizontal axis through any angle in the
range −90◦ < β < 60◦. It was assumed that at β < 0
the discharge of the plasma generator turns to the sur-
face of the Earth. The horizontal position of the plasma
generator corresponded to the angle β = 0. The tra-
jectory of motion of the face of plasma generator during
its rotation in the horizontal plane represented a circle.
All experiments were carried out in air at atmospheric
pressure.

The volt-ampere characteristics measured with the aid
of Rogovsky belt and an induction-free voltage divider as-
sembled from resistors of TVO-type, made it possible to
judge the amount of energy put into the discharge chan-
nel. Some typical volt-ampere characteristics are shown
in Fig.2. One can see from the Figure that the discharge
was of quasi-periodic character but with great damping.
The quasi-period of the discharge current in conditions

of the experiment was equal to ∼ 70ms. The amplitude
of the current in the ﬁrst maximum reached 21kA. The
maximum voltage between the electrodes equaled 3.5kV
at 5kV charging voltage on the energy-storage capacitor.
The dynamics of plasma outﬂow (11 in Fig.1) as well as
the characteristic dimensions of plasma jet were investi-
gated with the aid of a super-high-speed photorecorder
of SFR-type operating in single-frame ﬁlming mode. A
fragment of the record is given in Fig.3. The earlier stud-
ies of the plasma generator in use have shown that about
(30 − 40)% of its power were released in the optical fre-
quency range [18]. The absolute value of radiation energy
in quartz transmission band (λ > 220nm) was measured
by a thermal detector of LETI-type (12 in Fig.1) rigidly
ﬁxed on the plate (6 in Fig.1) so that the relative posi-
tions of the plasma generator and thermal detector could
not change as the plasma generator rotated. In so doing,
the axis of the thermodetector was directed to the prior
known range of maximum discharge glow lying on the
axis of the plasma generator ∼ 2cm from its face.

The thermodetector was calibrated with the use of
a standard radiation source of IFP-1200 type giving
Est = 35.64J/sr of radiant energy per unit of solid angle.
In the process of calibrating and measuring, the signal
from the thermodetector came to the input of a mirror-
galvanometer oscillograph K117. The radiant energy of
plasma was calculated from the formula

E = 4πAl

n,

2

where A is the calibration coeﬃcient, l is the distance
from the radiation source (in meters), n is the maximum
magnitude of signal on the strip of oscillograph (in mil-
limeters). At the characteristic dimensions of plasma cu-
mulation zone of the order of 1cm and the distance from
the thermodetector to the plasma source l = 20cm, the
radiation source could be taken as a point one. Because
the radiative energy of plasma is proportional to T 4, an
insigniﬁcant change in temperature T could be sensed by
the thermodetector. Despite a signiﬁcant increase in dis-
charge current and voltage of the plasma generator con-
sidered in comparison with those in the experiment of
Ref. [12], the thermal eﬀect of the new force action was
expected at a level of 10% owing to short duration of the
discharge. The main parameter measured in the experi-
ment was the deﬂection of the beam of the mirror- gal-
vanometer oscillograph K117. This deﬂection, propor-
tional to the radiative intersity of plasma, was recorded
on the photographic strip and gave information on the
amount of energy released in the discharge of the plasma
generator and, while scanning the celestial sphere, on the
direction of maximum action of the new force upon the
particles of the plasma discharge.

To investigate the direction of the global anisotropy
of physical space caused by the vector Ag, as well as
the new interaction connected with this vector, the fol-
lowing technique was used. In the ﬁrst of experiments
(15.12.1999-3.05.2000), the plasma generator was rotated
only around the vertical axis (7 in Fig.1).

The start time of the experiment was determined by
the position of the vector Ag near the horizontal plane.
On the basis of previous experiments [1,2,4–12], the vec-
tor Ag was assumed to have the following approximate
coordinates: 270◦ < α < 300◦, 20◦ < δ < 40◦. The
statistic average pattern of discharge currents shown in
Fig.1 was assumed to correspond to direction of the max-
imum current along the axis of the plasma generator.
Therefore one could expect that the direction of axis of
the plasma generator allowed to judge the eﬃcient an-
gle of action of the new force, i.e.
the eﬃcient angle
between the main discharge current and the vector Ag.
Recall that the new force acts when the vector of the dis-
charge current has a component directed oppositely to
Ag, and the vector of velocity V of the particles points
in Ag direction. In the experiments of 15.12.1999 and
20.01.2000, the luminous emittance of plasma jet was
measured by the thermodetector LETI in 30 degree in-
tervals through one complete revolution of the adjust-
ment table. In all other experiments the measurements
of the luminous emittance were made in 10 degree inter-
vals. In the second sequence of experiments, to improve
the direction of the new force in space, the celestial sphere
was scanned in the vicinity of the extremum directions
found in the previous experiments during rotation of the
plasma generator in the horizontal plane.

IV. RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS AND
DISCUSSION.

From 15.12.1999 till 3.05.2000, 32 experiments with ro-
tation of the plasma generator around the vertical axis
through 360◦ were carried out. The duration of one ex-
periment (25 or 30 shots) was no more than 30-25 min.
As an illustration, in Fig.4 shown are the values of de-
ﬂection L of the beam of the mirror-galvanometer oscillo-
graph (in millimeters) in dependence on the angle of ro-
tation θ in the experiments of 15.12.1999 and 20.01.2000.
In the experiment of 15.12.1999 conducted from 1640
till 1715, a burst in luminous emittance of plasma gen-
erator discharge was observed at 1655. Therewith the
angle θ measured from an arbitrary direction H shown in
Fig.5 was equal to 165◦, and the value of emittance was
25.7% above its average over the duration of the exper-
iment with a root-mean-square error of ±3.7%. In the
experiment of 20.01.2000 performed from 1535 till 1610,
the burst of plasma luminous emittance was detected at
θ = 135◦ (measured from that same direction H in Fig.5)
with 24% excess over the average value of emittance at a
root-mean-square error of ±3.3%.

For qualitative understanding of the result obtained
and the processing procedure, in Fig.5 are shown by ar-
rows some projections of the plasma generator axis on
the ecliptic plane corresponding to maximum luminous
emittances of plasma discharge with indication of con-
crete positions of the Earth in the process of its orbiting

3

around the Sun, the data of the experiments, and the
points in time at which the said maximum (with val-
ues greater than the experimental error) were observed.
The dotted line denotes secondary extremum directions
for the emittance.
In all experiments the plasma gen-
erator rotated counter-clockwise if the plane of rotation
seen from above. The direction of the axis of the plasma
generator at θ = 0 is indicated by letter H for each ex-
periment.

At the center of Fig.5 (at the site of the Sun) a cir-
cle diagram summarizing the results all experiments, is
given. They were processed in the following manner. The
circle was divided in ten-degree sectors so that the radius-
vector passing from the center of the circle along the ini-
tial boundary of the ﬁrst sector was aimed at the point
of vernal equinox (21.03) from which the angular coordi-
nate α is counted anticlockwise in the second equatorial
system.

In Fig.5 the heights of crosshatched triangles with a
20◦-angle at the center of the circle are proportional
to the sums (in percentage) of extremum deﬂections of
the oscillograph beam from its average coordinate which
stand out above the standard error of measurements and
fall within one or the other of the triangles, for all bursts
in luminous emittance observed in all 32 experiments.
As is seen from Fig.5, the maximum emittances were ob-
served (more often and with maximum amplitudes) in
the 25th, 26th and 33th, 34th sectors.

Notice that when the vectorial potential of the plasma
generator is directed exactly opposite to Ag, the change
in AΣ should be maximum and, hence, the magnitude
of the new force should be zero since ∂∆A
∂x = 0. It fol-
lows herefrom that the direction of the vector Ag must
be related with the sectors 29,30 (Fig.5). This direction
has the coordinates: α = 290◦ ± 10◦, and an eﬃcient
angle between the axial current of the plasma generator
and the vector Ag being equal to 140◦ ± 10◦. The result
obtained fully coincides (with an error above indicated)
with that of Ref. [12] in which a stationary plasma gener-
ator positioned on a special rotatable base and a copper
measuring tube with water passed through as a sensing
element located in the plasma jet, were used. The results
of the present paper do not contradict those of earlier
measurements of vector Ag [1,2,4–9] and are much more
precise. It should be noted that a considerable number
of bursts fall into the sectors 11 and 12, corresponding
to the direction precisely opposite to that of Ag. This
may be attributed to the action of side currents in the
discharge of the plasma generator (see Fig.1) directed at
an angle φ ≈ 30◦ to its axis. That is, in this case the side
currents make an angle of ∼ 150◦ with Ag which is near
to the most eﬃcient angle of ∼ 140◦ found from the di-
rection of the main axial current of the plasma generator.
Therewith the vector of mass velocity V of the discharge
particles is in opposition to Ag. Hence, the mechanism
of strengthening the new force is here ineﬀective as com-
pared with the situations in which the axis of the plasma
generator fall into the sectors 25,26 and 33,34 where the

vectors V and Ag are directed to the same side.

From 10.05.2000 till 31.05.2000 and from 11.10.2000
till 3.11.2000, a run of experiments was carried out with
scanning the celestial sphere in the vicinity of sectors
from 25th till 34th for determining most eﬃcient angles
of special position of the plasma generator axis relative
to the vector Ag, i.e. the angles of maximum action of
the new force.

As an illustration, in Table 1 the results of the last
experiment performed 3.11.2000 are presented.
In all,
77 shots were made with the average duration of scan-
ning the celestial sphere about 90min. The angle γ in
Table 1 corresponds to rotation of the plasma generator
around the vertical axis, and the angle β does to its ro-
tation around the horizontal axis. In each square of the
Table, the magnitude of deﬂection of the beam of the
mirror-galvanometer oscillograph proportional to the lu-
minous emittance of the plasma discharge, is shown. In
its turn, this emittance is proportional to the value of the
new force acting on electrons and other particles of the
discharge.

As the duration of the experiment was more than 1.5
hours (the rotation of the Earth through approximately
23◦), the average deﬂections (Lav) of the oscillograph
beam were calculated for one passage of the plasma gen-
erator through the angle γ at the angle β ﬁxed. The
value Lav and root-mean-square deﬂections σ (in per-
centage) are shown in Table 1 for each passage of the
plasma generator. The start time of the experiment was
chosen from an expected time of fall of Ag into the range
of horizontal plane.
In the experiment considered, the
angles γ = 220◦ and β = −20◦ correspond to a coinci-
dence of the north-direction at the place of the installa-
tion (Moscow Lomonosov University) with the direction
of the Ag - projection on the horizontal plane.

A summary result of vernal and autumnal experiments
with scanning the celestial sphere is shown in Fig.6. In
this Figure given are the relative spatial coordinates and
directions (arrows) of only those positions of the axis
of the plasma generator at which the deﬂection of the
oscillograph beam in the process of discharge was above
the root-mean-square one. In Table 1 they are asterisked
for the experiment of 3.11.2000. The results of the vernal
ran of experiments are related to 11.25 of Moscow time of
31.05.2000 and noted by circles in Fig.6. The autumnal
results (also asterisked) are related to 20.00 of Moscow
time of 11.10.2000.

When scanning the celestial sphere, the plasma gen-
erator was positioned during the experiment (at various
angles β) on circles of diﬀerent radii but with a deﬂec-
tion from the level of some horizontal plane no more than
±12, 5% in the range of angles −20◦ < β < 40◦. There-
fore, for clearness, all positions of the plasma generator
are given in projection onto the horizontal plane as for
vernal so for autumnal runs of experiments with indica-
tion of angles of the slope of the generator axis to this
plane (angle β). This is understandable since the sections
of cone by the plane are well known.

The ranges of an γ-angles 170◦ − 190◦ and 250◦ − 270◦
in Fig.6 correspond in space to the sectors 34,33 and
26,25 in Fig.5, respectively. The horizontal planes for
these data and the indicated related times of experiments
(31.05.2000, 11.25 and 11.10.2000, 20.00) intersect at an
angle of ∼ 35◦.

As is seen from Fig.6, with the exception of one and
only point (γ = 25◦, β = −40◦), all other positions of
the axis of the plasma generator in the vernal run of
experiments form a section of a cone of directions. The
dispersion of points in the autumnal run of experiments is
more great but all experimental points except two (γ =
220◦, β = +10◦; γ = 225◦, β = +10◦) ﬁt into the cone
shown in Fig.6 with a dispersion of coordinates of axial
directions equal to ±10◦.

With that same error, the axial direction of the cone
makes it possible to ﬁnd the direction of the vector Ag
(since along this direction ∂∆A
∂x = 0) from the vectorial
potential of the axial current of the plasma generator and,
hence, the new force should be zeroth, too, i.e. bursts
should be absent along Ag. This direction is also shown
It has the coordinates α ≈ 293◦ ± 10◦ and
in Fig.6.
δ ≈ 36◦ ± 10◦ in the second equatorial system. The di-
rection indicated qualitatively coincides with the results
of earlier experiments [1,2,4–9] and speciﬁcally with the
recent experiments carried out on the basis of stationary
plasma generator [12] as well as with astrophysical ob-
servation of anisotropy of distribution of solar ﬂares and
galactic pulsars [1,2,10,11].

V. ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS.

The errors in determining the direction of Ag can be
classiﬁed as systematic (σsyst) and random, or statistic
(σst) ones. In the experiment in consideration, the sys-
tematic errors can be due to the following causes:
ini-
tial bursts at the beginning of experiment with rotation
of the plasma generator associated with deﬁcient prior
”warming up” the system (i.e. without a previous ”rang-
ing ﬁre” before the readings of the oscillograph ﬂatten
out); a build up of the cathode of the plasma generator
in the course of the experiment giving rise to a change in
geometry of discharge currents (see Fig.1); burn-out of
an isolator also changing the pattern of currents in the
discharge; a glass turbidity of the thermodetector LETI;
a withdrawal of its axis from the direction of the maxi-
mum luminous emittance of the discharge; reﬂection of
light from objects surrounding the experimental installa-
tion; a limited resource of the capacitor.

The statistic error σst is caused by the following rea-
sons: the random character of geometric pattern of cur-
rents (see Fig.1), the inaccuracy of setting the angles γ
and β; exactness of instrumentation (power unit GOR-
100, voltmeter etc.);
inaccuracies of thermal detector
and of constructions in Figs.5, 6, non-controllable over-
heat of contacts; accidental changes in exterior conditions

(convective ﬂows in the room, lighting ﬂuctuations, elec-
tromagnetic background).

Consider the systematic errors.

In the early experi-
ments, the systematic error caused by a prior warm-up
of the plasma generator was included into the ﬁnal re-
sult. As was further clariﬁed, there were necessary on
the average 7-10 shots before start of the measurements
(rotation of the plasma generator in space) to reach op-
erating conditions with a minimum error. If this error
taken into account, the heights of crosshatched triangles
in sectors 17-20 (Fig.5) can be reduced by 25% making
the result more pronounced (in Fig.5 these errors are not
accounted). The inﬂuence of build up of the cathode in
the course of the experiments at the rate of about 1mm
per 30-40 shots on the deﬂection of the oscillograph beam
is not yet clear. This factor led as to deterioration of
sensitivity of measurements (decrease in average deﬂec-
tion Lav of the beam) so to an increase of sensitivity. In
the vernal and autumnal runs of experiments, the said
error was reduced to a minimum by way of returning
the plasma generator to its initial condition (scraping
bright the cathode and anode before each experiment).
In the course of experiment, the plasma generator was
not touched. The change of Lav due to build-up of the
cathode did not exceed 2.5% (σk).

In the long-term run of experiments performed from
15.12.1999 till 3.05.2000, the burn-out of the isolator led
to a decrease of the total sensitivity of the experimental
technique, i.e. to some stable drift at a level of 1 ÷ 2%
per experiment (∼ 37 shots). This drift was taken into
account and did not tell on the results of each separate
experiment so as on the ﬁnal results, too, because the
heights of cross-hatched triangles in Fig.5 are given in
percentage.

Before the new run of experiments with scanning the
celestial sphere, the plasma generator was replaced by a
new one with the same parameters. The grows of tur-
bidity of the glass of the thermal detector was resulting
in a drift of the beam deﬂection of the oscillograph and,
hence, in a deterioration of total sensitivity of the mea-
suring system, but cleaning the glass 1-2 hours before
each experiment weakened this eﬀect down to a level of
2% which practically did not inﬂuence on the relative
value of the amplitude of bursts analyzed. Withdrawal
of the axis of the thermal detector from the direction of a
maximum luminous emittance of the discharge could led
only to a drift (or leaps) of Lav no more than 1% (σm).
The experiments with the plasma generator were car-
ried out in a windowless underground room of the Phys-
ical Department of the Moscow State University. The
convective ﬂows were practically absent, the surround
objects were always at the same places, there were no
electromagnetic noise from exterior sources.
In total
∼ 1800 shots were made in the course of experiments.
The resource of the new capacitor was about 10000 shots,
therefore its instability could not tell on the experimen-
tal results. The summary systematic error (σsyst) due to
incontrollable processes during the experiment is repre-

since those processes were independent from each other.
The statistic error caused by the random character of
geometrical pattern of discharge currents (see Fig.1) en-
tered into the summary error of experiment and was not
determined separately. For the experiments carried out
from 15.12.1999 till 3.05.2000 (with rotating the plasma
generator in the horizontal plane), the summary error
comprising the systematic and random ones is shown in
Table 2.

The accuracy of setting angles γ and β in the course
of experiments was no lesser than 0, 5◦ (σo < 0, 5%).
The precision of the power GOR-100 and the voltmeter
equaled 0, 5% (σp), that of the mirror-galvanometer oscil-
lograph ∼ 2% (σo). The error of calibration of the ther-
mal detector was no more than 2% (σc) (according to
preliminary measurements). The accuracy of construc-
tion was ∼ 1◦. An incontrollable overheat of contacts
was impossible in the experiments considered. Random
changes in luminous emittance of surround objects were
absent. According to the data presented, the total statis-
tic error (σst) was no more than ∼ 2, 8%. The total
computation error in the experiments was ∼ 3, 9%. As
is seen, it laid near to the root-mean-square errors in-
dicated in Tables 1,2 which enhanced the validity of the
results obtained. As can be seen from the tables, in many
experiments the amplitude of deﬂection of the beam ex-
ceeded the root-mean-square error more than two times,
this also strengthens the plausibility of results.

VI. CONCLUSION.

Thus it is shown in the present work that the spatial
distribution of the intensity of plasma radiation of pulsed
plasma generator is clearly anisotropic. A cone of direc-
tions is observed in which plasma radiation reaches its
maximum. The results of the experiments can be satis-
factorily explained basing on a hypothesis about the ex-
istence of cosmological vectorial potential, a new funda-
mental vectorial constant determining a new anisotropic
interaction of objects in nature.

Why helicity injection causes coronal ﬂux tubes to develop
an axially invariant cross-section

1MC 128-95, Caltech, Pasadena CA 91125, USA

P. M. Bellan1

ABSTRACT

It is shown that electric current ﬂowing along an axially non-uniform magnetic ﬂux tube produces an
associated non-linear, non-conservative axial MHD force which pumps plasma from regions where the ﬂux
tube diameter is small to regions where it is large. In particular, this force will ingest plasma into the ends
of a fat, initially potential ﬂux tube and then pump the ingested plasma towards the middle bulge, thereby
causing mass accumulation at the bulge. The ingested plasma convects frozen-in toroidal magnetic ﬂux
which accumulates at the middle as well. Flux accumulation at the bulge has the remarkable consequence
of causing the bulge to diminish so that the ﬂux tube becomes axially uniform as observed in coronal loops.
Stagnation of the convergent plasma ﬂow at the middle heats the plasma. A small number of tail particles
bouncing synchronously between approaching ﬂuid elements can be Fermi-accelerated to very high energies.
Since driving a current along a ﬂux tube is tantamount to helicity injection into the ﬂux tube, this mass
ingestion, heating, and straightening should be ubiquitous to helicity injection processes.

Introduction

Remarkably detailed images of coronal loops provided by the TRACE spacecraft [Aschwanden et al
(2000)] indicate that these loops have cross-sectional area varying by only 10-20% over their entire length;
this surprising behavior cannot be explained by potential or force-free ﬁeld models [Klimchuk (2000]. We
present here a model explaining this behavior. Since the loops are typically twisted by a fraction of a turn
over their length, they contain magnetic helicity and so our model should be intrinsic to helicity injection
processes.

A coronal loop will be represented here by an axisymmetric ﬂux tube with straight axis (cf. top, Fig. 1)
and cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z) will be used. The loop is characterized by an initially potential poloidal
ﬂux function

We show that establishing a steady-state current I involves three sequential stages having distinct
physics. The ﬁrst stage, “ramp-up”, has physics akin to a linear Alfv´en wave, but it is assumed that
the ramp-up rate is suﬃciently slow that the eﬀective Alfv´en wavelength is inﬁnite. This means that
retarded time eﬀects due to wave propagation issues are negligible and the current ramps up everywhere
simultaneously as in an ordinary electrical circuit. The second stage, “axial ﬂow”, has ∂I/∂t = 0, but is
not in MHD equilibrium because unbalanced, non-conservative J × B forces exist which drive plasma ﬂows.
The third stage, “stagnation”, involves convection of magnetic ﬂux by the ﬂows, plasma heating as a result
of ﬂow stagnation, and straightening of the ψ proﬁle until MHD equilibrium is established.

First stage (Ramp-up)

We represent the current ramp-up by the time-dependence

where the ramp-up time is assumed to be much longer than the time it takes for an Alfv´en wave to propagate
the length h of the ﬂux tube, i.e., τ >> h/vA. Alfv´en wave propagation eﬀects are therefore unimportant
in which case the system behaves like an electric circuit. From Ampere’s law the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld is

We note that Bφ has minimal z dependence and that Ohm’s law implies Ez ≃ 0. Thus, integration of Eq.(7)
with respect to z gives

where on the basis of symmetry the location z = 0 is set to be at the axial midpoint of the ﬂux tube. Since
there is no axial force in this stage, Uz remains zero and so the radial component of the ideal Ohm’s law
gives

showing that Uφ is ﬁnite only when I is changing. The change in Uφ (toroidal acceleration) implies the
existence of a radial current determined from the toroidal component of the equation of motion

This current is just the polarization current [Chen(1984), p.40]

The transient toroidal velocity given by Eq.(9) results in an azimuthal displacement of the plasma,

showing that the plasma motion in this stage follows the twisting of the magnetic ﬁeld (the ﬁeld line can
be thought of as being frozen to the plasma so that when the ﬁeld line twists, so does the plasma). Thus

Fig. 1. Top: Initially potential ﬂux tube. Bottom: Flux tube with axial current has same poloidal proﬁle, but is
twisted. Cylindrical geometry (r, φ, z) is used; z = 0 is the ﬂux tube axial midpoint and the ﬂux tube ends are
at z = ±h.

Jr is ﬁnite only when I is changing and Jr is ﬁrst negative and then positive, corresponding to toroidal
acceleration followed by toroidal deceleration. The r direction here is really a proxy for the ∇ψ direction,
since the polarization current is in the ∇ψ direction (because the ﬂux tube is long and slender, the r direction
is nearly the same as the ∇ψ direction).

Once I has been established, both Uφ and the polarization current Jr remain zero. The poloidal ﬂux
function ψ at this stage has not changed from its original value — all that has happened is that a toroidal
ﬁeld has been added so that the total magnetic ﬁeld is now

B =

(∇ψ × ∇φ + µ0I∇φ) .

The original potential ﬂux tube has become twisted as shown in the bottom sketch of Fig. 1. Since ψ is
unchanged from its potential value, the bottom sketch in Fig.1 has the same poloidal proﬁle (envelope) as
the top sketch. This means that

Second stage (ﬂow acceleration)

The magnetic force is

J × B= (Jpol + Jtor) × (Bpol + Btor)

= Jpol×Bpol + Jpol × Btor + Jtor × Bpol.

The term Jpol×Bpol provides acceleration in the toroidal direction and involves the component of Jpol which
is perpendicular to Bpol. However, in the previous section we showed that the component of Jpol which is
perpendicular to Bpol is the polarization current and that this current scales as ∂2I/∂t2. Thus, when I is in
steady state there is no polarization current and no toroidal acceleration, and so Uφ remains zero. It was
also shown that Jtor = Jφ ˆφ is zero so long as the poloidal ﬂux surfaces are unperturbed from their initial
potential shape. We assume in this second stage that (i) the current is constant in which case Jpol×Bpol = 0
and Uφ = 0 and (ii) the poloidal ﬂux surfaces are unperturbed from their initial potential shape in which
case Jtor = 0. Thus, during this second stage the magnetic force reduces to

J × B = Jpol × Btor =

(∇ψ × ∇φ) × µ0I

∇φ = − µ0

.

(16)

The above force is non-conservative (i.e., ∇ × (J × B) is non-zero) and so cannot be balanced by a pressure
gradient since a pressure gradient is conservative (i.e., ∇ × ∇P = 0). Thus, it is not possible for equilibrium
to be attained in this stage. The only way for an equilibrium to be achieved is for the poloidal proﬁle of the
magnetic ﬁeld to change, which is what happens in the third stage, to be discussed later.

The fact that Jpol×Bpol = 0 means that (∇I × ∇φ) × (∇ψ × ∇φ) = 0 which in turn implies that ∇I is
parallel to ∇ψ and so I must be a function of ψ, i.e., I = I(ψ). Thus, the poloidal current ﬂows along the
poloidal ﬂux surfaces. This is consistent with the well-known Hamiltonian dynamics concept that, because of
conservation of canonical angular momentum, particles in a toroidally symmetric geometry cannot make an
excursion exceeding a poloidal Larmor radius from a poloidal ﬂux surface [e.g., see p.207-208 of Bellan(2000)].
In other words, Hamiltonian mechanics forbids the existence of steady current in the direction normal to a
poloidal ﬂux surface.

As sketched in Fig. 1, the poloidal ﬂux function is bulged near z = 0, corresponding to a weaker magnetic
ﬁeld near z = 0 than at the ends z = ±h. This would be the situation if the source currents for the poloidal
ﬁeld were located external to the ﬂux tube and so the middle of the ﬂux tube would be further from the
source currents than the ends. Since I = I(ψ), the current channel would also be bulged.

Equation (16) implies that the z component of the equation of motion is

φ is strong to regions where B2
This means that there is a force accelerating plasma from regions where B2
φ
is weak. Since I = I(ψ) and since ψ is bulged in the middle, Bφ must be stronger near z = ±h where
the current channel diameter is small than at z = 0 where the current channel diameter is large. There
consequently must be an acceleration of plasma from both ends (i.e., z = ±h) towards the middle (i.e., z = 0)
as shown in Fig. 2. The convergent axial pumping is similar to the “sweeping magnetic twist mechanism”
discussed by Uchida and Shibata (1988), but it should not be considered a wave because it involves actual
convection of material and not propagation of energy through a material. We note in passing that there
could be a few exceptional particles collisionally bouncing back and forth between the approaching ﬂuid
elements. These exceptional particles would be accelerated to very high energy by the Fermi acceleration
process, and so one would expect to see a tail of energetic particles develop in the vicinity of z = 0. The
Fermi process would thus predict that the most energetic particles would be located around the top of an
arched coronal loop and such is indeed what is observed (Feldman, 2002).

Third stage (stagnation, heating, and straightening)

The ﬂows from both ends converge at the middle and must come to a halt at z = 0. Convergence of
ﬂows means that ∇ · U is negative. This has important implications for the magnetic ﬁeld as can be seen
by considering the induction equation toroidal component,

We have shown that (i) Uφ = 0, (ii) Upol → 0 at the stagnation layer, and (iii) ∇ · Upol is negative. Thus,
in the vicinity of the stagnation layer

showing that Bφ must increase at the stagnation layer (increase of magnetic ﬁeld at regions of local ﬂow
convergence has been discussed in a more general context by Polygiannakis and Moussas (1999)).

The continuity equation in the vicinity of the stagnation layer gives ∇ · Upol = −ρ−1∂ρ/∂t and so in the

Thus, in the vicinity of the stagnation layer Bφ increases in proportion to the accumulation of mass. Since I is
constant during this stage, if Bφ increases, the radius of the current channel must decrease so as to maintain
µ0I = 2πrBφ constant. However, since I = I(ψ), if the radius of the current channel decreases, then the
radius of ψ must also decrease, thereby reducing the bulging. Ultimately, the bulge becomes vanishingly
small as more and more mass accumulates at the stagnation point and eventually a plasma-loaded, axially
uniform ﬂux tube results.

Since stagnation involves conversion of ﬂow velocity into thermal energy, the plasma will be heated at
the stagnation layer. The resulting plasma temperature can be estimated from the details of the stagnation
process. The axial magnetic force in Eq.(17) involves the gradient of the toroidal ﬁeld energy density and
so the kinetic energy gained by the plasma will be of the order of the change in toroidal ﬁeld energy density

Thus, when a current is made to ﬂow along an initially bulging current-free current channel, the
current channel will twist up (helicity injection), plasma will be ingested from both ends, accelerated toward
the middle where it accumulates and heats up at a stagnation layer. The equilibrium will become straight
(ﬁlamentary) and have β = α2a2/2 where α = µ0I/ψ and a is the radius of the current channel. To an
outside observer the current channel will look ﬁeld-aligned since the current is axially uniform and appears
to be embedded in an axially uniform axial magnetic ﬁeld. However, oblivious to the outside observer, within
the current channel there is a Bennett pinch-like radial force balance between plasma pressure pushing out
and JzBφ magnetic force pushing in.

Although the predicted β is typically very small, its eﬀect is crucial. To see this, consider that
in equilibrium J × B = ∇P so that B·∇P = (2π)−1 (∇ψ × ∇φ + µ0I∇φ) ·∇P = 0 and so P must be a
function of ψ, i.e., P = P (ψ). Deﬁning ψ0 as the ﬂux on the ﬂux surface where P vanishes, we can write
P (r, z) = (1 − ψ(r, z)/ψ0)P0 where P0 is the on-axis pressure (i.e., where ψ = 0). We can also write
µ0I(r, z) = αψ(r, z) and so J × B = ∇P can be written in Grad-Shafranov form as

If α2 = 4π2µ0a2P0/ψ2

speciﬁed boundary condition that P vanishes when ψ = ψ0 is the particular solution ψ(r, z) = ψ0r2/a2. This

axial ﬁeld at z = 0, it is seen that this condition for axial uniformity corresponds to α2 = 4π2µ0a2P0/B2
or α2a2/2 = β where β = 2µ0P0/B2
0. This equilibrium has Jφ = 0, so all conﬁnement is provided by the
Bennett pinch force ∼ JzBφ. The current is purely in the z direction, but the magnetic ﬁeld is helical.

The situation of small but ﬁnite β is substantially diﬀerent from the case of zero β because the system
is constrained to be axially uniform if and only if β = α2a2/2. The arguments presented in the discussion
of Eqs.(21-23) show that the MHD dynamical pumping tends to produce precisely the situation where
β = α2a2/2, and so it is predicted that MHD dynamical pumping will always cause conﬁgurations to tend
towards being axially uniform (i.e., ﬁlamentary), hot, and dense, and with β = α2a2/2.

The deﬁnition of α in Eq.(22) is closely related to that used for force-free ﬁelds. However, there is an
important diﬀerence because while Eq.(22) corresponds to having µoJz = αBz, Eq.(22) makes no statement
about any relationship between Jφ and Bφ. The ﬁnite β equilibrium discussed in the previous two paragraphs
is not force-free and involves the radial force balance JzBφ = −∂P/∂r with Jφ = 0;
this diﬀers from the
force-free radial equation JφBz − JzBφ = 0 with µoJφ = αBφ, µoJz = αBz. It is worth noting that the
determination of α made from vector magnetographs (e.g., Pevtsov et al., 1997) eﬀectively use the deﬁnition

7

α = µoJz/Bz which is equivalent to Eq.(22); these measurements do not provide information on either Jφ
or Bφ and so do not provide any information on the value of µoJφ/Bφ. Thus there is only one deﬁnition
for α, but its application is diﬀerent for force-free situations compared to ﬁnite-β situations: for force-free
situations α gives the ratio of current to ﬂux for both toroidal and poloidal directions whereas for the ﬁnite
β situation, α refers only to the the ratio of poloidal current to poloidal ﬁeld.

The prediction that β = α2a2/2 can be compared with the actual observed values of β in TRACE
ﬂux loops. To calculate the predicted β, we use the nominal measured ﬂux loop radius a = 1.6 × 106 m from
Aschwanden et al.(2000) and the nominal measured active region α = 2 × 10−8 m−1 from Fig. 4 of Pevtsov
et al. (1997). These parameters give a nominal βpredicted = α2a2/2 = 5 × 10−4. The observed value βobserved
is calculated using a nominal measured density n = 1015 m−3 and a nominal measured temperature 106
K [Aschwanden et al. (2000)]. In addition a nominal axial magnetic ﬁeld Bz = 1.5 × 10−2 T is assumed
based on the argument that because the ﬂux tube is axially uniform, its axial ﬁeld must also be axially
uniform and so will have the same value as the nominal Bz = 1.5 × 10−2 at the surface of an active region.
z = 4 × 10−4 which is very close to βpredicted. If the model were
These parameters give βobserved = 2µ0nκT /B2
wrong, one would expect no relationship between the predicted and observed β’s, i.e., one would expect a
discrepancy of many orders of magnitude between the predicted and the observed β’s.

This model also has implications regarding the brightening typically observed when the axis of a
coronal loop starts to writhe and the loop develops a kink instability (sigmoid). Since kink instability
occurs when αh ∼ 1 and for a long thin ﬂux tube a << h, this model predicts that β = α2a2/2 << α2h2/2
will still be small even if α is increased to the point where αh ∼ 1 and kink instability occurs. However, β
will increase as α increases and so this model predicts that the loop should brighten in proportion to the
writhing of its axis (i.e., in proportion to α as αh approaches unity).

Finally, we note that Feldman (2002) has recently used purely observational evidence to argue that electric
currents with geometry similar to what is discussed here are the means by which the Sun and similar stars
produce their coronal activity.

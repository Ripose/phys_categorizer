Abstract

In this paper we study the eﬀects of photoionization processes on the propagation of both

negative and positive streamer discharges. We show that negative fronts accelerate in the presence

of photoionization events. The appearance and propagation of positive streamers travelling with

constant velocity is explained as the result of the combined eﬀects of photoionization and electron

diﬀusion. The photoionization range plays an important role for the selection of the velocity of the

streamer as we show in this work.

INTRODUCTION

Since Raether [1] used cloud chamber photographs to study the creation and propaga-

tion of streamer discharges there has been considerable eﬀort to understand the underlying

processes driving them. A streamer discharge is considered to be a plasma channel which

propagates in a gas. The discharge propagates by ionizing the medium in front of its charged

head due to a strong ﬁeld induced by the head itself. This kind of discharges produces sharp

ionization waves that propagate into a non-ionized gas, leaving a non-equilibrium plasma

behind.

Raether himself realized that Townsend’s mechanism which takes into account the cre-

ation of extra charge by impact ionization [2] was not enough to explain the velocity of

propagation of a streamer discharge. He pointed to photoionization as the process which

enhances the propagation of the streamer. Due to the recombination of positive ions and

electrons, the head of the discharge is a strong source of high energetic photons. Photons,

emitted by the atoms that previous collisions have excited, initiate secondary avalanches in

the vicinity of the head which move driven by the local electric ﬁeld increasing the velocity

of propagation of the front.

In this paper we study the role played by photoionization in the propagation of both

negative and positive streamers. We take a model widely used in numerical simulations

and ﬁnd an eﬀective simpliﬁed model. We discuss how this simpliﬁed model retains all the

physics of streamer discharges including photoionization. The photoionization is modelled

as a nonlocal source term. We take the case of air and consider optical emissions from N2
and N+

2 molecules. Then we consider the sole role of photoionization in negative planar

shock fronts. Finally we analyse the case of positive planar fronts and propose a mechanism

for their formation and propagation. We end with an analysis of results and conclusions.

II. MODEL FOR A STREAMER DISCHARGE

Here we consider a ﬂuid description of a low-ionized plasma based on kinetic theory.

The balance equation for the particle density of electrons Ne is the lowest moment of the

Boltzmann equation,

is the average (ﬂuid) velocity of electrons and Se is the source term, i.e. the net creation rate

of electrons per unit volume as a result of collisions. It is convenient to deﬁne the electron

current density Je(R, τ ) as

Je(R, τ ) = Ne(R, τ ) Ue(R, τ ),

so that the balance equation can also be written as

The same procedure can be done, in principle, for positive (Np) and negative (Nn) ion

densities to give

Jp = Sp,

where Jp,n are the current densities of positive and negative ions, respectively, and Sp,n

are source terms. Conservation of charge has to be imposed in all processes, so that the

condition

Sp = Se + Sn,

holds for the source terms. Some physical approximations can now be done in order to

simplify the balance equations (3)–(5). The ﬁrst one is to assume that the electron current

Je is approximated as the sum of a drift (electric force) and a diﬀusion term

where E is the total electric ﬁeld (the sum of the external electric ﬁeld applied to initiate the

propagation of a ionization wave and the electric ﬁeld created by the local point charges) and

µe and De are the mobility and diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the electrons. Note that, as the initial

charge density is low and there is no applied magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic eﬀects in equation

(7) are neglected. Concerning the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, in the case of equilibrium, the kinetic

theory of gases links diﬀusion to mobility through Einstein’s relation De/µe = kT /e. With

respect to positive and negative ions, on time-scales of interest for the case of streamer

3

discharges, the ion currents can be neglected because they are more than two orders of

magnitude smaller than the electron ones [15], so we will take

Consider now the processes that give rise to the source terms Se,p,n:

Jp = Jn = 0.

1. The ﬁrst of these processes is the creation of free electrons by impact ionization: an

electron is accelerated in a strong local ﬁeld, collides with a neutral molecule and

ionizes it. The result is the generation of new free electrons and a positive ion. The

ionization rate is given by

e = Si
Si

p = νiNe,

where the ion production rate νi depends on the local electric ﬁeld, the density of the

neutral particles of the gas and their eﬀective ionization cross sections.

2. The second possible process is attachment: when an electron collides with a neutral

gas atom or molecule, it may become attached, forming a negative ion. This process

depends on the energy of the electron and the nature of the gas [9]. The attachment

rate can be written as

Sa

n =

Sa

e = νaNe,

−

where νa is the attachment rate coeﬃcient. Note that the creation of negative ions

due to these processes reduces the number of free electrons, so Sa

e is negative.

3. There are also two possible kinds of recombination processes: a free electron with a

positive ion and a negative ion with a positive ion. The recombination rate is

for electron-positive ion recombination, and

for positive ion-negative ion recombination, νep and νnp being the recombination coef-

ﬁcients respectively.

4. Finally, we can include photoionization: photons created by recombination or scatter-

ing processes can interact with a neutral atom or molecule, producing a free electron

and a positive ion. Models for the creation rate of electron-positive ion pairs due to

photoionization are non-local. This rate will be here denoted by

e = Sph
Sph

p = Sph.

(13)

Taking into account the expressions (7) and (8) for the current densities, and the equations

(9)–(13) for the source terms, we obtain a deterministic model for the evolution of the

streamer discharge,

In order for the model to be complete, it is necessary to give expressions for the source

coeﬃcients ν, the electron mobility µe, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient De and the photoionization

source term Sph. Finally, we have to impose equations for the evolution of the electric ﬁeld
E. This evolution of the electric ﬁeld is given by Poisson’s equation,

where e is the absolute value of the electron charge, ε0 is the permittivity of the gas, and we

are assuming that the absolute value of the charge of positive and negative ions is e. Note

that the coupling between the space charges and the electric ﬁeld in the model makes the

problem nonlinear. The model given by (14), (15), and (16), together with (17) has been

studied numerically in the literature [10]. There are other works where the electrical current

due to ions (8) is taken into account although not photoionization [13].

III. A SIMPLIFIED MODEL

In this section we will simplify the model given by equations (14)–(16). In order to be

speciﬁc and ﬁx ideas we shall consider the case of air. In [10], some data are presented for

5

the ionization coeﬃcients and the photoionization source term. Using these data we shall

see that one can neglect the quadratic terms involving the coeﬃcients νep and νnp since they

are about two orders of magnitude smaller than νi. The same can be said about the terms

involving the coeﬃcient νa. First we write equations (14)–(16) as

·

In these equations, and using the data in [10] (Figure 1 and Table 2), the term νi is of
the order of 1010 s−1 for large electric ﬁelds, νa is about 108 s−1, and νep and νnp are about
10−13 m3
s−1. Moreover, Np is of the same order of Ne. Then, in equation (20), in the
stationary regime when the particle densities reach the saturation values, one has Nn ∼
1021m−3. So that, it follows from equation (19) that, in the stationary regime, the
νa/νnp ∼
108Np is two orders of magnitude smaller than the term νiNe ∼
term νnpNnNp ∼
Hence the terms νaNe and νnpNnNp can safely be neglected. The model then reads

1010Ne.

In order to neglect the term νepNeNp by comparison with the term νiNe, it is necessary than
νi/νep ∼
Np (and then Ne) satisﬁes Np ≪
Poisson equation (17) to write equation (21), without the term νepNeNp, as

1023m−3. To see that it is the case, we use the

Let us remark that the orders of magnitude deduced for Ne and Np coincide with those

found in full numerical simulations by Liu and Pasko [10].

IV. THE PHOTOIONIZATION TERM

In this section we will write down an explicit form of the photoionization source term.

In our study on the eﬀects of photoionization on the evolution of streamers in air we con-
sider that only optical emissions from N2 and N+

2 molecules can ionize O2 molecules. The

photoionization rate, due to the fact that the number of photons emitted is physically pro-

portional to the number of ions produced by impact ionization, is written as the following

nonlocal source term [10, 11],

In this expression, pq is the quenching pressure of the single states of N2, p is the gas pressure,

ξ is the average photoionization eﬃciency in the interval of radiation frequencies relevant

to the problem, ν∗ is the eﬀective excitation coeﬃcient for N2 state transitions from which

the ionization radiation comes out (we take ν∗/νi to be a constant), and χmin and χmax are,

respectively, the minimum and maximum absorption cross sections of O2 in the relevant

radiation frequency interval. The kernel Kph(

In the numerical computations, we will approximate the function k(s) by functions with

the same behaviour at inﬁnity and zero as the ones shown in equations (44) and (45). The

simulations show that the result is insensitive to the details of these approximations and

they only depend on the behaviour at zero and inﬁnity. In fact, we will use a kernel such

that it is equal to (45) for s < 1 and it is equal to (44) for s > 1. The constant in equation

(45) will be chosen in such way that k(s) is continuous at s = 1.

Following [10] and [18], we will take for the simulations ξ(ν∗/νi) = 0.1, pq = 30 Torr,
χ1 = 0.035 Torr−1cm−1 pO2, χ2 = 2 Torr−1cm−1 pO2. We will assume the partial pressure

of the oxygen in air is given by pO2 = γp, where p is the total pressure and γ a pure

number between zero and one. For the inverse ionization length α0, we will take the value
for nitrogen, that depends on pressure [8] as α0 = 5.8 Torr−1cm−1 p. For the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient [13], we take De = 0.1 m2/s.

In our ﬁrst numerical experiment, we choose as initial data a Gaussian distribution of

charge. We take E0 = 1 and the pressure p = 750 Torr. In Fig.1 we can see the evolution of

the initial negative charge distribution when the photoionization term is neglected. It can

be seen that electrons move in the direction of increasing z where the anode is situated. A

negative front is developed at the right of the initial distribution [17]. The electrons at the

left side of the initial distribution move also following the electric ﬁeld, until they reach the

main body of the plasma where the electric ﬁeld is screened. Then they stop there (around

z = 2 in Fig.1). When the photoionization term is included, the proﬁles change. In Fig.2

the same numerical experiment is carried out, with the inverse of photoionization range

γ = 0.21, which corresponds to the normal conditions of air in the atmosphere.

We can track the motion of the negative front by looking at the time evolution of the

point z∗(t) at which the electron density has a given value. In Fig.3, we compare the graphs

photoionization is an acceleration of the negative front which reaches a higher though still

which decay exponentially fast at inﬁnity.

to the propagation of the negative front (the left part of the initial distribution). This will

be called from now on “the positive front”. We can observe in Fig.2 an eﬀect consisting in

the accumulation of electrons in a small region of space in the positive front. This fact is

easy to understand by considering the production of electrons away from the positive front

which are drifted towards the positive front following the electric ﬁeld. In the positive front,

electrons and positive ions are balanced and hence the net electric ﬁeld cancels. Therefore

electrons cannot proceed any further beyond the positive front and they accumulate there.

This is an eﬀect purely associated to photoionization which cannot be explained by invoking

any diﬀerent eﬀect. Unless there is some mechanism allowing the electrons to spread out

once they accumulate at the positive front, their density will grow indeﬁnitely and eventually

will blow up. We will see in next section that this mechanism is diﬀusion and the net eﬀect

of photoionization and diﬀusion is the appearance of travelling waves moving towards the

cathode, i.e. positive ionization fronts.

where S is the photoionization source term and is written as in equation (55).

The main diﬀerence in our approach to this problem with respect to the problem without

diﬀusion is that now an integration along characteristics does not lead to simpliﬁcations due

to the presence of the second derivatives associated with diﬀusion. Instead we will use the

method of ﬁnite diﬀerences.

In Fig.4, we represent the proﬁles for ne with D = 0.57, p = 750 Torr and γ = 0.25. We

have used an initial charge distribution which has a maximum at z = 10. When it evolves, it

can be observed a negative planar front developing. The propagation of the negative front is

almost identical with or without diﬀusion when photoionization is present. However there is

now a positive front moving towards the cathode. The positive front moves with a constant

velocity which is smaller than the velocity of the negative front. In Fig.5 we have plotted the

position z∗ of a point of the negative front and of the positive front which has the particular

value of the electron density ne = 0.02. The parameters are the same as in Fig.4, but for

three diﬀerent values of γ. For the parameter values chosen above, we have computed the

ratio between the velocities of positive and negative fronts: cpos/cneg = 0.34 for γ = 0.9,

cpos/cneg = 0.68 for γ = 0.25 and cpos/cneg = 0.86 for γ = 0.1. The ratio grows when the

photoionization range 1/γ increases and the velocities for negative and positive fronts tend

to increase and get closer to each other.

The propagation of positive fronts as travelling waves results from the combined action

of photoionization and diﬀusion. This is in contrast with the propagation mechanism for

negative fronts, which are also travelling waves but they result from a combination of impact

ionization and convection by the electric ﬁeld. In the latter case, diﬀusion and photoion-

ization only aﬀect the negative fronts by changing their velocity and their shape. All this

conclusions are rather insensitive to the detailed form of the kernel k(s) (see formula (41))

provided it decays exponentially fast at inﬁnity, and hence our conclusions hold with a high

15

degree of generality.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have studied the eﬀect of photoionization in streamer discharges. We

have deduced a minimal model including photoionization and studied with this model the

propagation of both positive and negative fronts in the planar case. We have found the ap-

pearance of travelling waves which accelerate when the photoionization range increases. For

negative fronts we have studied the eﬀect of photoionization both when electronic diﬀusion

is neglected and included. For positive fronts, electronic diﬀusion has to be taken into ac-

count and we have shown how photoionization plays the crucial role pointed by Raether on

increasing the velocity of propagation. The control parameter is the photoionization range,

i.e. the typical distance at which photons are able to ionize the media. Physically in air,

this parameter depends on the amount of oxygen and nitrogen present. It is interesting to

point out that for real discharges in the atmosphere, this parameter varies with the altitude.

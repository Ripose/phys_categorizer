Nonlinear relaxation ﬁeld in charged systems under high electric ﬁelds

LPC-ISMRA, Bld Marechal Juin, 14050 Caen and GANIL, Bld Becquerel, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France

K. Morawetz

The inﬂuence of an external electric ﬁeld on the current in charged systems is investi-
gated. The results from the classical hierarchy of density matrices are compared with the
results from the quantum kinetic theory. The kinetic theory yields a systematic treatment
of the nonlinear current beyond linear response. To this end the dynamically screened
and ﬁeld-dependent Lenard-Balescu equation is integrated analytically and the nonlinear
relaxation ﬁeld is calculated. The classical linear response result known as Debye - On-
sager relaxation eﬀect is only obtained if asymmetric screening is assumed. Considering
the kinetic equation of one specie the other species have to be screened dynamically while
the screening with the same specie itself has to be performed statically. Diﬀerent other
approximations are discussed and compared.

I. INTRODUCTION

High ﬁeld transport has become a topic of cur-
rent interest in various ﬁelds of physics. In semi-
conductors the nonlinear transport eﬀects are ac-
cessible due to femto - second laser pulses and
shrink devices [1].
In plasma physics these ﬁeld
eﬀects can be studied within such short pulse pe-
riods [2]. One observable of interest is the cur-
rent or the electrical conductivity which gives ac-
cess to properties of dense nonideal plasmas [3]. In
high energy physics the transport in strong electric
ﬁelds is of interest due to pair creation [4]. In order
to describe these ﬁeld eﬀects one can start conve-
niently from kinetic theory. Within this approach
the crucial question is to derive appropriate kinetic
equations which include ﬁeld eﬀects beyond linear
response.

At low strength of the external electric ﬁeld one
expects the linear response regime to be valid.
Then the contribution of ﬁeld eﬀects to the con-
ductivity can be condensed into the Debye- On-
sager relaxation eﬀect [5–11] which was ﬁrst de-
rived within the theory of electrolytes [12–16]. De-
bye has given a limiting law of electrical conduc-
tivity [12] which stated that the external electric
ﬁeld E on a single charge Z = 1 is diminished in
an electrolyte solution by the amount

δE = E (1 −

κe2
6T

)

(1)

where e is the elementary charge, E the electric
ﬁeld strength, T is the temperature of the plasma
and κ is the inverse screening radius of the screen-
ing cloud. This law is interpreted as a deceleration
force which is caused by the deformed screening
cloud surrounding the charge. Later it has been

shown by Onsager [13] that this result has to be
corrected to

δE = E (1 −

κe2

3(2 + √2)T

)

(2)

if the dynamics of ions (Z = 1) is considered.
While the linear response theory seems to repro-
duce this Onsager result [8,9,11], the kinetic theory
seems to support more the Debye result [10,17,11].
The correct treatment is a matter of ongoing de-
bate. In this paper we will give the result beyond
linear response for the statically and dynamically
screened approximation. Here diﬀerent approxi-
mations of kinetic theory will be discussed and the
one which leads to the closest form to the hydro-
dynamical approximation (Onsager result) is pre-
sented.

The kinetic approach describes the time evolu-
tion of the one particle distribution function within
an external ﬁeld E as

∂
∂t

f − eZ E

∂
∂k

f = I[f, E]

(3)

where the ﬁeld dependent collision integral I[f, E]
has to be provided by diﬀerent approximations. In-
tegrating this kinetic equation over the momentum
k one obtains the balance of the current. For sim-
plicity we assume that the distribution function
can be parameterized by a displaced local equilib-
rium one with a ﬁeld and time dependent momen-
tum f (k, t) = f0(k − p(E, t)) which is related to
the current J as

J(E) = nZe

(5)

where the relaxation ﬁeld δE(E) as well as the free
conductivity R(E) follows from the ﬁeld dependent
collision integral. The total conductivity E = σJ
is then given by

σ(E) =

R(E)

1 + δE(E)

E

.

(6)

The free conductivity R is the subject of intense
investigations in the literature [3]. It is known that
the Coulomb divergence for small wave vectors is
omitted if screening is included and the divergence
at large wave vectors is omitted by the De Broglie
wavelength i.e. by the quantum eﬀects. We will
not consider the discussion of the free conductivity
R here but concentrate on the relaxation ﬁeld δE.
The free conductivity can be obtained by the same
considerations as will be outlined here. We want
to point out that the relaxation ﬁeld will turn out
to be free of long wave divergences in the classical
limit in contrast to the free conductivity R.

First we recall the hydrodynamical approach
starting from the
classical Bogoliubov-Born-
Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy which
results into an analytical formula for the classi-
cal relaxation eﬀect already reported [18]. This
result is then compared with the quantum ki-
netic approach. We give a short rederivation of
the ﬁeld dependent kinetic equations in dynami-
cal screened approximation from the Green’s func-
tion technique in Sec. III. Two approximations,
the static screening as well as dynamical screening
are presented.
In the fourth section we will de-
rive the ﬁeld dependent current analytically. We
present both the statically as well as dynamically
screened treatment as analytical results. The clas-
sical expressions for the statically screened result
[17] is compared with the classical result from hy-
drodynamical approximation. The dynamical re-
sult is then derived analytically too and it will be
shown that only for asymmetric screening the hy-
drodynamical result can be approached. In Sec. V
we shortly discuss the physical limitation of ﬁeld
strengths for the local equilibrium assumption and
the gradient approximation. Sec. VI summarizes
and the appendix gives the calculation of some in-
volved integrals appearing during the integration
of the Lenard-Balescu equation.

The starting point for the classical considera-
tions is the BBGKY hierarchy [19,20] which reads

Let us already remark here that the friction with
a background described by the mobilities b couple
the two sides of the equation (17). If we had not
considered this friction, Si = 0, we would have
obtained that the left and the right hand side of
(17) vanish separately. This will lead essentially
to a diﬀerent result even for inﬁnite small friction.
There is no continuous transition between these
two extreme cases pointing to a symmetry breaking
in the two treatments. Let us ﬁrst discuss the case
with background friction.

A. With background friction

This we can solve together with (18). First we
calculate the eﬀective ﬁeld strength at the position
of the electron in linear response

Further on, we suppose that the particles interact
with some background (e.g. neutrals or electrolyte
solvent) by the collision integrals Sa with the fol-
lowing properties

where ba is the mobility of particle of type a. This
friction with a background serves here to couple
the two - particle equations and will be considered
inﬁnitesimal small in the end. However, as we will
demonstrate this yields to a symmetry breaking in
the system which leads basically to diﬀerent results
than neglecting this friction.

Fourier transform of the resulting two equations
(9) into momentum space and assuming a homo-
geneous density n(r) = n we arrive at the coupled

(22)

For single charged ions Z = 1 the inﬂuence of the
mobilities drop out and we recover the Onsager
result (2).

Since this result is independent of the mobilities
one could conclude that this is a universal limiting
law. However we will express two doubts here. As
one sees for charges Z > 1 the Onsager result is
approached only in the limit where the ion mobil-
ities are much smaller than the electron mobilities
bi/be → 0. This means of course that the electrons
have diﬀerent friction with a thought background
than the ions. In other words there is an explicit
symmetry breaking mechanism included by assum-
ing such collision integrals with the background.
Therefore we will obtain another solution if we con-
sider no friction.

The second remark concerns the limit of one-
component system which one can obtain by setting
Z = −1. The Onsager result or hydrodynamical
result with friction (21) leads to twice the Debye
result (1) in this case but with opposite sign. Op-
positely we will see in the following that the per-
fectly symmetric treatment of the species without
friction with a background will lead to a vanishing
one component limit as it should. This again un-
derlies the symmetry breaking if one assumes an
inﬁnitesimal small friction with a background.

For completeness, we want to recall the expres-
sion of the nonlinear Onsager result [18,17] which
is obtained from the limit bi/be → 0 of the system

B. Without background

can be easily veriﬁed using the symmetry hab(k) =
hba(−k). Together with (18) we can solve for Φe
and the relaxation ﬁeld is obtained instead of (24)

We see that the linear response result for Z = 1
is twice the Debye result (1). For equal charged
system Z = −1 which would coincide with a one
component plasma no relaxation eﬀect appears as
one would expect.
In other words in a perfectly
symmetric mathematical two - component plasma
there is another relaxation eﬀect than in a system
which distinguishs the components by a diﬀerent
treatment of friction. The Onsager result (24) does
not vanish for the limit of one-component plasma
Z = −1. This is due to the diﬀerent treatment of
ions and electrons there which assumes explicitly
a two component plasma. Therefore the limit Z =
−1 does not work there.
This result is quite astonishing. One would ex-
pect that the limiting procedure which transforms
the system (18) into (26) would also lead to a

smooth transitions of the end results. However
this is not the case. While the separate limit of
be,i → ∞ of (18) leads to (26) there is no possi-
bility to transform the result (21) into the linear
response result of (28). This underlines that due to
even inﬁnitesimal small friction assumed in obtain-
ing (21) there occurs a symmetry breaking in the
sense that the electrons and ions are not anymore
symmetrically treated.

This lesson we have to keep in mind when
we now advance and investigate the systematic
treatment by quantum kinetic theory. There we
will ﬁnd also complete diﬀerent results when we
use asymmetric screening compared to symmetric
screening. Of course, we will not assume any phe-
nomenological friction since the kinetic theory pro-
vides for a systematic description of all occurring
processes. Here we want only to point out that
the above symmetry breaking is the main reason
for the confusion in literature. Following the lin-
ear response formalism an asymmetric treatment
of two - particle correlation functions is used in
that the electrons are statically screened [11]. This
seemingly innocent usage leads there to an occa-
sional agreement for Z = 1 with the Onsager result
(2).

Another advantage of the kinetic theory we want
to point out here. The classical local equilibrium
or hydrodynamical approximation does not lead to
a mass dependence of the relaxation eﬀect. This
will be provided by the kinetic theory.

III. QUANTUM KINETIC THEORY

We will

formulate the kinetic theory within
gauge invariant functions not missing ﬁeld eﬀects.
The most promising theoretical tool is the Green
function technique [1,21–23]. The resulting equa-
tions show some typical deviations from the ordi-
nary Boltzmann equation: (i) A collision broad-
ening which consists in a smearing out of the ele-
mentary energy conservation of scattering. This is
necessary to ensure global energy conservation [24].
(ii) The intra-collisional ﬁeld eﬀect, which gives ad-
ditional retardation eﬀects in the momentum of the
distribution functions. This comes mainly from the
gauge invariance.

One of the most important question is the range
of applicability of these kinetic equations. Up to
which ﬁeld strengths are such modiﬁcations impor-
tant and appropriate described within one-particle
equations? In [25] this question has been investi-
gated for semiconductor transport. It was found
that for high external ﬁelds the intra-collisional
ﬁeld eﬀect becomes negligible. This range is given

by a characteristic time scale of ﬁeld eﬀects τ 2
F =
m¯h/(eE · q) which has to be compared with the
inverse collision frequency. This criterion is a pure
quantum one.
It remains the question whether
there are also criteria in the classical limit. For a
plasma system we will discuss in the summary that
there is indeed a critical value of the ﬁeld strength
which can be given by classical considerations.

A. Deﬁnitions

In order to describe correlations in highly
nonequilibrium situations, we deﬁne various cor-
relation functions by diﬀerent products of creation
and annihilation operators

G>(1, 2) = < Ψ(1)Ψ+(2) >
G<(1, 2) = < Ψ+(2)Ψ(1) > .

(30)

Here <> is the average value with the unknown
statistical nonequilibrium operator ρ and 1 denotes
the cumulative variables (r1, s1, t1...) of space,
spin, time etc. The equation of motion for the
correlation functions are given in the form of the
Kadanoﬀ-Baym equation [26,27,23]

− i(cid:0)G−1
0 G< − G<G−1
−i(cid:0)ΣRG< − G<ΣA(cid:1)

0 (cid:1) = i(cid:0)GRΣ< − Σ<GA(cid:1)

(31)

where the retarded and advanced functions are in-
troduced as AR(1, 2) = −iΘ(t1− t2)[A>± A<] and
AA(1, 2) = iΘ(t2−t1)[A>±A<]. Here operator no-
tation is employed where products are understood
as integrations over intermediate variables (time
and space) and the upper/lower sign stands for
Fermions/Bosons respectively. The Hartree- Fock
drift term reads

where G(r2, t1, r2, t1) = n(r2, t1) is the density.

(33)

B. Gauge invariance

In order to get an unambiguous way of con-
structing approximations we have to formulate our

5

theory in gauge invariant way. This can be done
following a procedure known from ﬁeld theory [28].
This method has been applied to high ﬁeld prob-
lems in [29]. With the help of the Fourier transform
of an arbitrary function G(x,X) over the relative
coordinates x = (r2 − r1, t2 − t1) = (r, τ ) with the
center of mass coordinates X = ((r2 + r1)/2, (t2 +
t1)/2) = (R, t) one can introduce a gauge-invariant
Fourier-transform of the diﬀerence coordinates x

where the χ function was chosen in such a way that
the scalar potential is zero Aµ = (0,−cEt). There-
fore, we have the following rule in formulating the
kinetic theory gauge-invariantly

1. Fourier transformation of the 4-dimensional
diﬀerence-variable x to canonical momentum
p.

2. Shifting the momentum to kinematic mo-

mentum according to p = k − eEt.

3. The gauge invariant functions ¯G are given by

G(p, t) = G(k − eEt, t) = ¯G(k, t)
= ¯G(p + eEt, t).

(35)

We shall make use of these rules in the following
sections. In [30] this procedure has been general-
ized for two - particle Greens functions and leads to
the ﬁeld - dependent Bethe - Salpeter - equation.

ing to the assumed slowly varying space depen-
dence we have used gradient expansion for space
variables and dropped all R-dependence for sim-
plicity. This criterion is discussed in the last sec-
tion (96). With the help of the gauge invariant for-
mulation of Green’s function (III B), we can write
the kinetic equation (36) ﬁnally in the following

(37)

This kinetic equation is exact in time convolutions.
This is necessary because gradient expansions in
time are connected with linearization in electric
ﬁelds and consequently fail [32]. The gradient ap-
proximation in space has been applied assuming
slow varying processes in space. This corresponds
to the limit of a weakly coupled plasma, which we
employed already in Section II. Please remind that
due to Coulomb gauge we do not have space inho-
mogeneity by the electric ﬁeld.

It is instructive to verify that

(40) satisﬁes the frequency sum rule R dωA0(ω) =

2π. This interaction-free but ﬁeld-dependent re-
tarded Green’s function GR
o can be obtained from
the interaction-free and ﬁeld-free Green’s func-
tion by a simple Airy transformation [36]. This
is an expression of the fact that the solutions of
the Schr¨odinger equation with constant electric
ﬁeld are Airy-functions. The retarded functions
can therefore be diagonalized within those eigen-
solutions [37,29].
It can be shown that (40) re-
mains valid even within a quasiparticle picture [36],
where we have to replace simply the free dispersion
k2/2m by the quasiparticle energy ǫk.

E. The Problem of the ansatz

In order to close the kinetic equation (36), it
is necessary to know the relation between G> and
G<. This problem is known as an ansatz and must
be constructed consistently with the required ap-
proximation of self-energy. Assuming the conven-
tional KB ansatz [26] we have a relation between
the two time Green functions and the distribution
function

G<(k, ω, r, t) = A(k, ω, r, t) f (k, r, t)
G>(k, ω, r, t) = A(k, ω, r, t) (1 ∓ f (k, r, t)).
This is quite good as long as the quasi-particle pic-
ture holds and no memory eﬀects play any role. As
we shall see, the formulation of kinetic equations
with high ﬁelds is basically connected with a care-
ful formulation of retardation times. Therefore,
the simple ansatz, called KB ansatz fails.

(41)

Another obscure discrepancy is the fact that
with the old ansatz, one has some minor diﬀerences
in the resulting collision integrals compared with
the results from the density operator technique.
With the old ansatz, one gets just one half of all
retardation times in the various time arguments
[31,33]. This annoying discrepancy remained ob-
scure until the work of Lipavsky, et al. [38] where
an expression is given for the G< function in terms
of expansion after various times. We can write in
Wigner coordinates

This generalized- Kadanoﬀ- Baym (GKB) - ansatz
is an exact relation as long as the selfenergy
is taken in Hartree- Fock approximation. To-
gether with the requirement of gauge invariance of
Sec. III B and using the quasiparticle spectral func-
tion (40) with quasiparticle energies ǫk instead of
k2/2m, the GKB ansatz ﬁnally reads

Neglecting the retardation in f one recovers the or-

The generalized ansatz takes into account history
by an additional memory. This ansatz is superior
to the Kadanoﬀ-Baym ansatz in the case of high
external ﬁelds in several respects [39]: (i) it has
the correct spectral properties, (ii) it is gauge in-
variant, (iii) it preserves causality, (iv) the quan-
tum kinetic equations derived with Eq.(52) co-
incide with those obtained with the density ma-
trix technique [40,41,31], and (v) it reproduces the
Debye-Onsager relaxation eﬀect [10] .

Other choices of ansatz can be appropriate for
other physical situations. For a more detailed dis-
cussion see [42].

F. Kinetic equation in dynamically screened

approximation

For Coulomb interaction it is unavoidable to
consider screening if one does not want to obtain
long range or short wave vector divergences. To
obtain an explicit form for the kinetic equation we
have to determine the selfenergy Σ>,<. The dy-
namically screened approximation is given by ex-
pressing the self energy by a sum of all ring dia-
grams. The resulting kinetic equation is the quan-
tum Lenard - Balescu equation, which has been
derived for high ﬁelds in [36]. We give this approx-
imation in exact time convolutions. The selfenergy
is given in terms of the dynamical potential V

The out-scattering term I out is given by f ↔ 1−f .
Here we used the ansatz (43) and have employed

8

the approximation t ± 1
2 τ ≈ t in the density ﬂuc-
tuation (47) which corresponds to a gradient ap-
proximation in times for the density ﬂuctuations.
Since the center of mass time dependence is car-
ried only by the distribution functions in (47), this
approximation is exact in the quasistationary case
which we investigate in the next section. All inter-
nal time integrations remain exact. Of course, for
time dependent phenomenae we have to question
this approximation.

Eq. (50) represents the ﬁeld dependent Lenard-
Balescu kinetic equation [36] which was here
slightly rewritten and which form will turn out
to be very convenient for the later analytical in-
tegration. Other standard approximations like the
T-matrix [30] approximation resulting into a ﬁeld
dependent Bethe-Salpeter equation can be given.

1. Kinetic equation in statically screened

approximation

Using the static approximation for the dielec-
tric function E(q, 0, t) in (50), the kinetic equation
for statically screened Coulomb potentials in high
electric ﬁelds appears [10,31,36]

with js(x) = (x cos x− sin x)/x2. The two integrals
over the distribution functions I2 can be done with
the result

1/2 in diﬀerent retardations [31]. This would lead
to no relaxation eﬀect at all [10]. Furthermore it is
assumed, that no charge or mass transfer will occur
during the collision. Otherwise one would obtain
an additional term in the cos - function propor-
tional to τ 3.

Two modiﬁcations of the usual Boltzmann colli-
sion integral can be deduced from (52): (i)A broad-
ening of the δ-distribution function of the energy
conservation and an additional retardation in the
center-of-mass times of the distribution functions.
This is known as collisional broadening and is a
result of the ﬁnite collision duration [43]. This ef-
fect can be observed even if no external ﬁeld is
applied. It is interesting to remark that this colli-
sional broadening ensures the conservation of the
total energy [24].
If this eﬀect is neglected one
obtains the Boltzmann equation for the ﬁeld free
case. (ii) The electric ﬁeld modiﬁes the broadened
δ- distribution function considerably by a term
proportional to τ 2. This broadening vanishes for
identical charge to mass ratios of colliding parti-
cles. At the same time the momentum of the dis-
tribution function becomes retarded by the elec-
tric ﬁeld. This eﬀect is sometimes called intra-
collisional-ﬁeld eﬀect.

IV. FIELD EFFECTS ON CURRENT

We are now interested in corrections to the parti-
cle ﬂux, and therefore obtain from (52) the balance
equation for the momentum

(55)

Here we search for the relaxation ﬁeld (5)
which will be represented as renormalization of
the external ﬁeld E similar to the Debye-Onsager-
Relaxation ﬁeld in the theory of electrolyte trans-
port [14–16]. This eﬀect is a result of the deforma-
tion of the two-particle correlation function by an
applied electric ﬁeld.

To proceed we assume some important restric-
tions on the distribution functions. First, we as-
sume a nondegenerate situation, such that the
Pauli blocking eﬀects can be neglected. Second, to
calculate the current for a quasistationary plasma
we choose Maxwellian distributions analog to (10)

With this form (63) we have given an extremely
useful representation because the ﬁeld eﬀects, con-
tained in x, are separated from the quantum ef-
fects, which are contained in ζ. The integral in
(63) can be performed analytically in the classical
limit ζ → 0. For the more general quantum case
with arbitrary ζ the linear and cubic ﬁeld eﬀect
can be given analytically and are discussed in [17].
We will not discuss them here.

Performing the classical limit ζ → 0 one obtains

from (63) that [18,17]

and x from (65). We see that for a plasma consist-
ing of particles with equal charge to mass ratios,
no relaxation ﬁeld appears. The link to the known
Debye- Onsager relaxation eﬀect can be found if we
assume that we have a plasma consisting of elec-
trons (me , ee = e) and ions with charge ei = eZ
and temperatures Te = Ti = T . Then (68) reduces

This formula together with the general form (68) is
the main result of this chapter. It gives the classi-
cal relaxation eﬀect for statically screened approx-
imation up to any ﬁeld strength and represents a
result beyond linear response. We see that in the
case of single charged heavy ions the Debye result
(1) is underestimated by a factor of two.

B. Dynamically screened result

The calculation of the current with the collision
integral for dynamically screened potentials (50)
can be performed analytically as well. For the
quasistationary condition we can calculate the fre-
quency integral in (50) analytically using the iden-
tity [44] for the classical limit o(¯h)

gives rise to a ﬁeld dependence starting quadrati-
cally and will be not considered in this work.

C. Thermally averaged dynamically screened

result

We will now give an approximative treatment
of the dynamical screening used in [8]. This ap-
proximation consists into the replacement of the
dynamical screening in the collision integral (50)
which is E(ω, q)−2 by (1 + κ2Vaa(q)/4π)−1. This
represents a thermal averaging [44] of E−2 which
can be proven easily with the help of appendix A.

Therefore the relaxation eﬀect (69) in linear re-
sponse for single charged ions takes the form of (1)
and twice the static screened result (69) and half
of the dynamical screened result (81).

As we see from ﬁgure 1 the diﬀerent approxima-
tions lead to very diﬀerent results. The statically
screened result (69) underestimates the Debye re-
sult by factor 2 which is corrected by the ther-
mal averaged treatment of the screening.
If we
calculate instead the complete dynamical screened
result (77) or (80) we obtain twice the Debye re-
sult (1) and the thermal averaged screened result.
However there is a complete diﬀerent charge de-
pendence. We have to observe that the perfectly
symmetric treatment of screening does not repro-
duce the hydrodynamical result which is the On-
sager result (2) for linear response.

FIG. 1. The nonlinear Debye-Onsager relaxation ef-
fect vs. scaled electric ﬁeld for an electron and single
charged ion system. The hydrodynamical approxima-
tion (24) leads to the Onsager result (2) for small ﬁeld
√2. The statically screened result (68)
strength 2 −
or (69) leads to half the Debye result (1). The ther-
mally averaged approximation of the dynamical screen-
ing (82) leads to the Debye result while the full dy-
namically screened approximation (81) leads to twice
the Debye result. Also the hydrodynamical result (28)
without background leads to twice the Debye result.

D. Asymmetric dynamical screened result

We want now to proceed and ask under which
assumptions the Onsager result (2) might be re-
produced. Following the results we saw from the
hierarchy we have consequently to treat the elec-
trons (specie a) and ions (all other species) asym-
metrically. This we will perform in the same spirit
as Onsager in that the ions have to be treated dy-
namical (as before) but the electrons are screened
statically.

This means we consider as the potential not the
bare Coulomb one but a statically screened Debye
potential for specie a. The ions (all other species)
will then form the dynamical screening. In com-
parison with the chapter before we can perform
all steps analogously except two modiﬁcations, eq.
(85) and (88). First we observe that instead of (71)
we have now

in the for-factor of (72) and (79). This leads in the
limit of big mass diﬀerences to a for-factor in (77)
and (80) respectively

modiﬁcation I :

(85)

we have seen how many diﬀerent considerations
are possible. Please note that the special case
Z = 1 could lead occasionally to a seemingly agree-
ment between diﬀerent treatments. We think that
the charge dependence incriminates diﬀerent treat-
ments.

The second modiﬁcation is that in (72) one has to

which agrees with (21) if we consider that the mo-
bilities are very diﬀerent bi/be → 0 in (22).
The same result we obtain from the thermally
averaged result (66) since there appears no such
function as (83) and therefore the modiﬁcation I
of (85) does not apply but solely the modiﬁcation
II of (88). We therefore obtain (69) but

F dyn
asy (x) = 2F dyn(x) −

√2F dyn(√2x)

with F dyn of (82). The linear response leads then
exactly to the same result as from the dynamical
screening (89), i.e.
the Onsager result with the
same charge dependence.

The fact that we reproduce the classical Onsager
result with the same charge dependence can be
considered as very satisfactory. The more since

FIG. 2. The diﬀerent asymmetric screened approxi-
mations for the relaxation eﬀect versus ﬁeld strength.
The hydrodynamical result (24) is compared with the
thermally averaged asymmetric screened result of (90)
as well as the asymmetric screened one of (88).

In ﬁgure 2 we see that the asymmetrical screened
result (80) with (88) approaches the hydrodynami-
cal or Onsager result (2) rather well for small ﬁelds
while it is too low at high ﬁelds. On the other hand
the thermally averaged symmetrical screened re-
sult (90) agrees with the hydrodynamical approx-
imation (24) in the low and high ﬁeld limit. Why
the hydrodynamical result cannot be reproduced
completely within the kinetic theory remains still
a puzzle. Probably the remaining diﬀerence is due
to the neglect of the ﬁeld eﬀect on the screening
itself [39].

V. RANGE OF APPLICABILITY

During the derivation of the quantum kinetic
equations there has been assumed the gradient ap-
proximations which restricted the spatial gradients
of the system. Here we want to discuss up to which
ﬁeld strength this assumption is justiﬁed.

The electric ﬁeld is limited to values x << 1 for
x from (65). This can be deduced from the expres-
sion for the dynamical screened result (81). The
expression has a remove-able singularity at x = 1.
Therefore we see a smooth curve. Nevertheless this
is the ﬁeld strength where something is happening.

For equal masses and temperatures of plasma com-
ponents this condition translates into

VI. SUMMARY

E <

κT
e

.

(91)

We interpret the occurrence of such singular point
that no thermal distributions are pertained in the
system. Then we have to take into account non-
thermal ﬁeld dependent distributions which have
been employed to study nonlinear conductivity
[45–47].

The condition (91) allows for diﬀerent physical
interpretations. Within the picture of the screen-
ing cloud we can rewrite (91) into

eE < m

v2
th
rD

.

(92)

This means that a particle moving on the radius of
the screening cloud rD = 1/κ with thermal velocity
v2
th = T /m should not be pulled away by the acting
ﬁeld force. We can discuss this limit also via the
energy density which can be reached in a system
by the applied ﬁeld. We can reformulate once more
the condition (91) to ﬁnd equivalently

E2
4π

< nT.

(93)

This means that we have essentially non-thermal
eﬀects to be expected if the energy density of the
ﬁeld becomes comparable with the thermal energy
density.

The validity criterion (91) can now be used to
check the weak space inhomogeneity which has
been assumed during our calculation. Quasi- equi-
librium in charged systems with external ﬁelds can
only be assumed if the ﬁeld current is accompanied
by an equivalent diﬀusion current

The nonlinear relaxation ﬁeld of a charged sys-
tem under the inﬂuence of high electric ﬁelds is in-
vestigated. The local equilibrium or hydrodynam-
ical approach starting from the classical BBGKY
hierarchy is compared with the results from the
quantum kinetic equations.

We come to the same conclusion considering
the hydrodynamical approximation or the kinetic
theory that a perfectly symmetric two compo-
nent plasma will lead to a diﬀerent relaxation ef-
fect than the case where we consider the mov-
ing charge asymmetrically from the screening sur-
rounding. In the hydrodynamic approach this has
been achieved by friction with a background, in the
kinetic approach we have realized it due to asym-
metric screening. Within this asymmetric treat-
ment the limit to a one component plasma which
would be to set the ion charge to Z = −1 leads to
a non-vanishing ﬁnite quantity. Oppositely in the
perfectly symmetrical treatment this limit vanishes
in that the relaxation ﬁeld vanishes as it should.
The perfectly symmetrical treatment of species in
the system leads to twice the Debye result diﬀerent
from the Onsager result in linear response.

Diﬀerent approximations of the kinetic ap-
proaches are compared and discussed. We found
that the symmetrical treatment of species as well
as the asymmetrical treatment leads to the same
corresponding results as the hydrodynamical ap-
proach for linear response. But for higher ﬁeld
strengths there appear minor diﬀerences which are
probably due to the neglect of the ﬁeld dependent
screening itself. The thermally averaged approx-
imation of screening has the advantage to agree
for low and high ﬁelds with the hydrodynamical of
local equilibrium approach.

the poles at the Matsubara frequencies. Because
we calculate only with the classical dielectric func-

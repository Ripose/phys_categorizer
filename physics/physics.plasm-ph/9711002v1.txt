NONLINEAR MAGNETOSONIC WAVES IN
A MULTI-ION-SPECIES PLASMA

Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory
P.O.Box 451, Princeton NJ 08543

S. Boldyrev

Abstract

Magnetosonic waves are intensively studied due to their impor-
tance in space plasmas and also in fusion plasmas where they are used
in particle acceleration and heating experiments. In the present paper
we investigate the magnetosonic waves propagating in a multi-ion-
species plasma perpendicular to an external magnetic ﬁeld. Due to
the presence of several ion species, this mode splits into two branches:
high- and low-frequency modes. This opens a new channel of nonlinear
interactions (between these two modes), and qualitatively changes the
picture of turbulence in the long-wave region. Using the exact kinetic
approach, we derive a general system describing the propagation of
nonlinearly coupled high- and low-frequency waves. This system in-
cludes the KdV, Boussinesq, and Zakharov equations as limiting cases.
Solitary solutions of the system of coupled equations are obtained.

I. DISPERSION RELATIONS FOR HIGH-FREQUENCY
AND LOW-FREQUENCY WAVES

We consider two-dimensional turbulence of magnetosonic (also referred
to as magnetohydrodynamic or compressional Alfven) waves, propagating
perpendicular to an external magnetic ﬁeld in a collisionless cold plasma with
two ion species. As was shown in [1], in such a plasma the magnetosonic
mode is split into two branches:
low-frequency and high-frequency waves.
The dispersion relation for them can be found from:

(we denote ion species as a
and α marks the particle type: α =

frequency wave and the other to a low frequency wave [1]. The dispersion
law of the high frequency wave is:

II. NONLINEAR CURRENT AND NONLINEAR RESPONSE TENSOR

The nonlinear response Skk1k2 is deﬁned as:

Skk1k2 = e∗i (k)Sijlej(k1)el(k2) ,

(12)

(13)

and the tensor Sijl can be found from the nonlinear current:

In our limit of cold plasma and small k this current can be obtained from
the collisionless kinetic equation, in which we neglect small terms kVT α/ω
(where VT α is the thermal velocity of particles of type α). A simple iteration
procedure [4] then leads to the following expression for the nonlinear response
tensor:

S1ij = Σα −

α −

sj (k2)

Particles of all types contribute to this tensor. As an example, let us calculate
the nonlinear response for the high-frequency ﬁeld E1 and low-frequency ﬁeld
E2. Consider the expression:

k2s

ε(α)
sj (k)

ej(k2)

in our system where k2y = 0. We will always assume that the ﬁeld with
subscript 2 corresponds to the low-frequency wave. Since for ω2 = k2VA we
have ˜g << ˜ε
⊥

, we obtain that ej(k2) = (0,

1), and:

(16)

Further, for high-frequency waves (ω = ω0) we have ˜ε

Note that in a general case we should use an expression symmetrized with
respect to the last two indices for the nonlinear response:

˜Skk1k2 = Skk1k2 + Skk2k1 .

Calculation of Skk2k1 can be done in an analogous way:

We will suppose that βk1 << 1 and term (19) is negligible in comparison
with (18). We will return to the meaning of this inequality in Section III.

III. KINETIC DERIVATON OF THE NONLINEAR COUPLED EQUATIONS

We use the kinetic approach for the derivation of nonlinear coupled equa-
tions for the high- and low-frequency waves. We use Maxwell’s equations for
the ﬁelds and the collisionless Boltzmann equation for the particle distribu-
tion function.

We represent the high-frequency ﬁeld in the form

E = E+ + E− ,

where the ﬁeld E+ is concentrated at the frequency ω = ω0, and the ﬁeld E−
ω0. Maxwell’s equations give:
at the frequency ω =

where jN is the nonlinear current obtained from (13). This current is of
the second order in ﬁeld amplitudes, therefore if the ﬁeld Ej in equation
(21) is concentrated at ω0, the only term contributing to the current is:
E0E+, where E0 is the low-frequency ﬁeld. In nonlinear current (21), one

E0E0 and E+E−.

Let us substitute Ej = ej(k)Eω,k, where ej(k) is the the polarization
vector of the ﬁeld in (21), and multiply this expression by e∗i (k). Then we
have for the high-frequency ﬁeld:

We will consider the limit βk1 << 1 (i.e. k1VA << V 2

the last term in (26). One can also show that the third order term can be
safely neglected for our problem.

Consider now the derivation of the equation for the low-frequency ﬁeld.

ﬁeld polarization, we get:

This is the main equation for the low-frequency ﬁeld. The contribution to
the low-frequency current is given by two terms proportional to E0E0 and
to E+E−. Consider the contribution of the ﬁrst one. In this case, all three
polarization vectors in formula (12) are related to the low-frequency ﬁeld.
Using result (16) and the following expression for the polarization vector
e(k1) = (sin φ1,

We need to introduce some ordering to understand what terms can be ne-
glected in (35-36). First of all, the most interesting case is when the disper-
sion and the nonlinear terms in (35) are of the same order. This gives:

where V0 is the characteristic velocity of the nonlinear wave. We also neglect
the cubic term in (35). One can show that this can be justiﬁed only when

Then in the left hand side of (36) we neglect the dispersion term µ−k4

. This is justiﬁed, since this term is always small compared to the
last nonlinear term in (36) due to (37). Thus we assume (37) and (38). If
one then introduces, for convenience, the magnetic ﬁeld perturbation B1 as
E0 = B1

1. The ﬁrst nonlinear term in (36) dominates the second one, i.e. B1 <<

2. Both nonlinear terms in (36) are of the same order, i.e. B1 ∼

Consider the ﬁrst ordering. From (37), (38) we get:

E+.

Then, the linear terms in (36) must be of the same order as the nonlinear
terms. Comparing k2E0 and the nonlinear term, we have:

which is in agreement with (39). Consider the left half of inequality (39):

Using (40), it is easy to check that this condition coincides with the previous
assumption βk << 1 (see (49)). Thus, in limit (39), we neglect the cubic
term in equation (35) and the second nonlinear term in equation (36).

Consider now the second ordering, B1 ∼

E+. In this case we keep both
nonlinear terms in equation (36). Comparing these nonlinear terms with the
linear ones, we ﬁnd that they are of the same order if the velocity of the
nonlinear wave V0 is close to VA:

δV
VA ∼
The condition βk << 1 together with (37) then gives:

which is more restrictive than (41). We therefore demand (42), and the
second ordering is then also self-consistent. In this case, we neglect the cubic
term in (35) and keep both nonlinear terms in (36).

Consider the soliton solutions for system (35-36). Let us rewrite the
system in the (x, t)-representation. For this purpose we introduce the “po-
tential” Φ: E0 = ∂Φ/∂t. The system then takes the form:

relative magnitudes of the nonlinear terms in (44). In the ﬁrst case we neglect
the second nonlinear term in (44) and get the following system:

In the second case we keep both nonlinear terms in (44). In this case, the
nonlinear wave has velocity V0 which is close to the velocity VA, and we can
replace: ∂2
∂2
∂x2 in the right hand side of equation (44). Then, if we are
interested in the wave moving in some particular direction (say, to the right)
we can further simplify (44) by writing:

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have presented the general kinetic method for derivation
of nonlinear equations for magnetosonic waves, propagating perpendicular
to an external magnetic ﬁeld in a multi-ion plasma. Equations (45)-(46)
constitute the so-called Zakharov system [3], ﬁrst derived for Langmuir and
Ti) plasma. Without the high-
ion-acoustic waves in non-isotermal (Te ≫
k4/VA, Eq. (44) is the Boussinesq
frequency ﬁeld and with dispersion term µ
equation for acoustic waves, and it can be reduced to the KdV equation
exactly in the same way as we went from (44) to (48).

Equations (45)-(46) can be used to describe weak turbulence of interact-
ing high- and low-frequency waves. For this purpose, the equations should
be rewritten in the Hamiltonian form, expanded in small amplitudes of in-
teracting ﬁelds, and averaged over statistical realizations. Such a procedure
is described in [5]. In [2] the same turbulence was considered using another
method. The system can also be used to describe transition to strong turbu-
lence.

The system analogous to (47)-(48) was considered by Makhankov [6], and
also by Nishikawa et al [7] in connection with near-sonic solitons of coupled
Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves.

We would like to stress that the developed method, though it is not as
transparent as the hydrodynamical approach, is exact and rather straightfor-
ward, and can be easily generalized to other plasma systems. Moreover, it, in
principle, allows the consideration of such kinetic eﬀects as Landau damping
on a rigorous basis, which is impossible with the hydrodynamical approach.

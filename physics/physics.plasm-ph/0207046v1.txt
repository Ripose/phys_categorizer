Abstract

The main purpose of this work is the investigation of the inﬂuence of electron-
positron-ion on the electrostatic wakeﬁelds that are deriven by intense, short
electromagnetic wave packets in a three component unmagnetized plasma. The
equations that describes the deriven electrostatic wakeﬁeld are given in the form
of system of nonlinear diﬀerential equations. The solution of that system was
carried out numerically and the results are displayed graphically.

Introduction

Recently, the nonlinear propagation of electromagnetic waves in electron-positron
plasma has attracted the interest of researchers[1] [2] and[3]. Due to the fact
that the electron-positron plasma are found in Van Allen Belts, near polar cap
of pulsar, in the active galactic nuclei, as well as in the early universe.

When plasma becomes so hot that it becomes relativistic the temperature
T of the plasma exceeds the rest mass energy of electrons mc2 = 0.5 MeV.
In this relativistic regime the processes of electron-positron pair creation and
annihilation become important; 2γ ⇀↽ e+ + e−. In relativistic temperature the
electrons (and positrons) energy Ee far exceeds the rest mass energy so that
electrons and positrons behave kinematically similar to photons and come into
equilibrium with nearly equal population.

In 1990 T. Tajima and T. Taniuti [4] are interested in the process of electron-
positron plasma creation and annihilation occurs in relativistic; unmagnetized
plasma at high temperature of the plasma exceeds the rest mass energy of
the electrons. They are emphasize the dominant population of electrons and
positrons and neglect ions eﬀect.

In [6], it was shown that , the positrons can be used to probe the parti-
cle transport in Tokamak plasma. This new diagnostic technique could also
be useful in studying transport in other magnetic conﬁnement devices such
as reversed-ﬁeld pinches and magnetic mirrors. Electron-positron pair pro-
duction can also be possible during intense short laser pulse propagation in
plasma. When picosecond electromagnetic pulse having intensity beyond 1021
W/cm2 interact with plasma, the plasma electrons can acquire oscillatory ve-
locity (Vos = eEo/mc) higher than the speed of light c. Here Eo(Wo) is the
amplitude (frequency) of the EM radiation, c & m are respectively the magni-
tude of the electron charge and the rest mass of the electron.

Several authors have suggested that when the oscillatory electron energy
Eos = mc2(1 + V
c2 )1/2 exceeds 3mc2 then these electrons can create an electron-
positron pairs in the presence of background positive ions. And also it has been
shown that powerful short laser pulsar can generate a large amplitude electro-
static wave (Wakeﬁeld) in a plasma in which the electron plasma frequency ωpe is
much smaller than ωo. Since the amplitude of the excited wakeﬁeld can be very
high ( eφ/moc2
1, where φ is the electrostatic potential ), the plasma
electrons also acquire the longitudinal energy EL = moc2(1 + P 2
≫
3moc2, where Pk is the relativistic momentum in the wakeﬁeld. Thus, there
is the possibility of creating electron-positron pairs in those regions in which
wakeﬁelds and short EM pulses are localized. Since the lifetime τp > ω−1
of
p
the positron in such a plasma is suﬃciently long.

We shall have a plasma that is an admixture of electrons, positrons and
positive ions. A three-component electrons-positron-ion plasma can indeed be
created in laboratory plasma. V. I. Berezhiani, and et. al. [3] have investigated
the inﬂuence of electron-positron pairs on the electrostatic wakeﬁeld that are
driven by intense, short EM wave packets in a three component unmagnetized

1

plasma. They found that in contrast to pure electron-ion plasma, the pres-
ence of positrons signiﬁcantly reduce both the amplitude and the wavelength of
wakeﬁelds. In view of their investigation, it is suggestive that the production
of electron-positron pairs by wakeﬁelds in Laboratory and cosmic plasma ought
to be reconsidered because the presence of pairs may aﬀect the wakeﬁeld that
is responsible for accelerating electrons to very high energy.

The important of three component admixture plasma had led to much re-
lated theoretical investigations. Of these, Rizzato [7], investigated the possibility
of high-frequency EM localization in cold unmagnetized plasmas made up of
electrons, positrons and ions. It was shown that such a possibility depends on
the concentration of particles, on the velocity of the solitons and on the angle
between the direction of modulation and the direction of the fast spatial de-
pendence. In particular in the case of pure electron-positron plasmas Rizzato
was shown that no localized solution is possible which is in contrast with results
derived by Moﬁz et. al. (1985) from a similar model. Also it was shown that
low frequency magnetic ﬁelds may appear in the case of oblique modulation
and that both the amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld and the amplitude of the
solitary wave are very sensitive functions of the angle between the direction of
modulation and fast spatial dependence.

Berezhiani, et. al.

[1] analyzed the nonlinear interaction of an arbitrarily
large amplitude circularly polarized EM wave with an unmagnetized electron-
positron plasma. taking into account relativistic particle-mass variation as well
as large-scale density perturbation created by radiation pressure. It was found
that the interaction is governed by an equation for the electromagnetic wave
envelope, which is coupled with a pairs of equations describing fully nonlinear
longitudinal plasma motion. This results should be useful for the understanding
of nonlinear photon motion in cosmic plasmas, such as those found in the early
universe and active galactic nuclei.

Moﬁz [5] studied the nonlinear propagation of Langmiur wave in a hot ul-
trarelativistic electron-positron plasma. It was shown that, in a dense ultrarel-
ativistic electron-positron plasma electrostatic modes with wavelength greater
than the plasma Debye length produce Langmiur Solitons that are spiky in na-
ture. One essential feature of these solitons is that they can not form an energy
ﬂow toward smaller size, since they can not merge with each other. To merge,
the soliton would have to give energy to sound waves, which do not exist in
electron-positron plasma. In the one dimensional case the only process accruing
in a soliton gas is nonlinear interaction with electron and positron, i. e. nonlin-
ear Landau damping, which stops the solitons without changing its amplitude.
The stopping length is of order of the soliton width, which is very small for a
dense plasma. Thus the soliton will be stopped in a short time, of the order of
their creation. these spiky short duration Langmiur solitons might berelated to
the pulsar radiation and with its microstructures.

In [8], V.I.Berezhiani, M.Y. El-Ashry and U.A. Moﬁz are investigated the
propagation of intense electromagnetic radiation in an admixture of unmagne-
tized electron-positron-ion plasma analytically. It was shown that electromag-
netic radiation of arbitrary amplitude in presence of heavy ions, in contrast to

2

the case of pure electron-positron plasma, may be localized with the generation
of humped ambipolar potential in the plasma, i.e. the driving ﬁeld intensity
creates intense soliton in the plasma with the generation of double hump am-
bipolar potentials. With the increase of the value of ǫ (=nop/noe), they found
that the tendency of converging a single hump soliton to a double hump one.
In their investigation they neglected the ion dynamics. Consideration of ion
dynamics, of course, may eﬀect the localization phenomenon. This eﬀect will
be studied here.

Now, the vector potential A for circularly polarized EM wave can be ex-

pressed as:

and

where:

A = A⊥ + Az

A⊥ = a(z, t) ei(kz

and a and ´a are real functions.

To describe the admixture of plasma made up of electrons, positrons and
ions, we use Maxwell equations, in which the ﬁelds are expressed in terms of the
potentials, as described above. Accordingly, using Poissons equation, we may
obtain the following equations for the potentials:

is characterized by noe = nop + noi, where noα, is the equilibrium density of the
particle α.

Analyzing the equation of motion and the wave equations into longitudinal

integrated to give:

Equation( 16) and equation( 17) are coupled together and forming a system
of nonlinear second order deferential equations. It is rather diﬃcult to obtain
an analytical solution of them. However, in the following, we present numerical
solutions of equation( 16) and equation( 17). Taking some typical parameters:

and by using Taylor method, we have obtained the wakeﬁeld proﬁles at diﬀerent
values of ǫ1 and ǫ2. The results are displayed in the following ﬁgures:

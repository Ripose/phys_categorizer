I. Introduction

In a recent paper [1] it is proved that, if the ideal MHD stationary ﬂows of a
cylindrical plasma with arbitrary cross sectional shape are purely poloidal, they
must be incompressible. This property simpliﬁes considerably the equilibrium
problem, i.e.
it turns out that the equlibrium is governed by an elliptic partial
diﬀerential equation for the poloidal magnetic ﬂux function ψ which is amenable
to several classes of analytic solutions. For an arbitrary ﬂow, i.e. when the ve-
locity has non vanishing axial and poloidal components, the equilibrium becomes
much more complicated. With the adoption of a speciﬁc equation of state, e.
g.
isentropic magnetic surfaces [2], the symmetric equilibrium states in a two
dimensional geometry are governed by a partial diﬀerential equation for ψ, which
contains ﬁve surface quantities (i.e. quantities solely dependent on ψ), in con-
juction with a nonlinear algebraic Bernoulli equation. The derivation of analytic
solutions of this set of equations is diﬃcult.

In the present note we study the equlibrium of a cylindrical plasma with
incompressible ﬂows and show that the incompressibility condition makes it pos-
sible to construct analytic equilibria, which constitute a generalization of the ones
[1]. This is the subject of Sec. II. The special class of incom-
obtained in Ref.
pressible equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces is examined in Sec.
III.
Section IV summarizes our conclusions.

II. Equilibrium equations and analytic solutions

The ideal MHD equilibrium states of plasma ﬂows are governed by the fol-

lowing set of equations, written in standard notations and convenient units:

∇ · (ρv) = 0

ρ(v · ∇)v = j × B − ∇P

∇ × E = 0

∇ × B = j

∇ · B = 0

E + v × B = 0.

The system under consideration is a cylindrical plasma with ﬂow and arbitrary
cross sectional shape. For this conﬁguration convenient coordinates are ξ, η and
z with unit basis vectors eξ, eη, ez, where ez is parallel to the axis of symmetry
and ξ, η are generalized coordinates pertaining to the poloidal cross section. The
equilibrium quantities do not depend on z. The divergence free ﬁelds, i.e. the
magnetic ﬁeld B, the current density density j and the mass ﬂow ρv, can be

1

expressed in terms of the stream functions ψ(ξ, η), F (ξ, η), Bz(ξ, η) and vz(ξ, η)
as

B = Bzez + ez × ∇ψ
j = ∇2ψez − ez × ∇Bz

ρv = ρvzez + ez × ∇F.

Constant ψ surfaces are the magnetic surfaces. Eqs. (1)-(6) can be reduced by
means of certain integrals of the system, wich are shown to be surface quantities.
To identify two of these quantities, the time independent electric ﬁeld is expressed
by E = −∇Φ and the Ohm’s law (6) is projected along ez and B, respectively,
yielding

ez · (ez × ∇F ) × (ez × ∇ψ) = 0

Eqs. (10) and (11) imply that F = F (ψ) and Φ = Φ(ψ). Two additional surface
quantities are found from the component of Eq. (6) perpendicular to a magnetic
surface:

and from the component of the momentum conservation equation (2) along ez:

B · ∇Φ = 0.

With the aid of Eqs. (10)-(13), the components of Eq. (2) along B and perpen-
dicular to a magnetic surface, respectively, are put in the form

It is pointed out here that Eqs. (16) and (17) are valid for any equation of state
for the plasma.

In order to reduce further the equilibrium equations, we employ the incom-

pressibiliy condition

Then Eq. (1) implies that the density is a surface quantity,

∇ · v = 0.

ρ = ρ(ψ),

and, consequently, Eqs. (14) and (15) yield

Bz = Bz(ψ),

vz = vz(ψ).

expression for the pressure, i.e.

(19) and (20), Eq.

(16) can be integrated yielding an

We note here that, unlike in static equilibria, in the presence of ﬂow magnetic
surfaces do not coincide with isobaric surfaces because Eq. (2) implies that B·∇P
in general diﬀers from zero. In this respect, the term Ps(ψ) is the static part of
the pressure which does not vanish when F ′ is set to zero; Eqs. (14), (15) and
(17) have a singularity when

The absence of any hyperbolic regime in Eq. (23) can be understood by noting
that, as is well known from the gas dynamics, the ﬂow must be compressible to
allow the equilibrium diﬀerential equation to depart from ellipticity. Eq. (23)
does not contain the axial velocity vz and is identical to the equation governing
cylindrical equilibria with purely poloidal ﬂow [1]. With the use of the ansatz

This is similar in form to the equation governing static equilibria; the only explicit
reminiscence of ﬂow is the presence of Mc. Eq. (24) can be linearized for several

III. Equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces

For fusion plasmas the thermal conduction along B is fast compared to the
heat transport perpendicular to a magnetic surface and therefore equilibria with
isothermal magnetic surfaces are of particular interest. The plasma is also as-
sumed to obey the ideal gas law P = RρT . For this kind of equilibria, Eq. (21)
implies that |∇ψ| is a surface quantity and consequently from Eq. (17) it turns
out that ∇2ψ is a surface quantity as well. Thus, the incompressible, T = T (ψ)
equilibria satisfy the set of equations

and

|∇ψ|2 = (g(ψ))2

∇2ψ = f (ψ).

(25)

(26)

Eqs. (25) and (26) imply that, on a magnetic surface the modulus of the vector
∇ψ, which is perpendicular to this (arbitrary) magnetic surface, and ∇2ψ, related
to the variation of |∇ψ|, are constants. Therefore, one could speculate that
magnetic surfaces are restricted to be circular. This conjecture can be proved as
follows.

The coordinates ξ, η and z are speciﬁed to be the Cartesian coordinates x, y,
z. With the introduction of the quantities p = ∂ψ/∂x, q = ∂ψ/∂y, r = ∂2ψ/∂x2
and t = ∂2ψ/∂y2 , Eqs. (25) and (26) are written in the form

The set of Eqs. (27) and (28) can be integrated by applying a procedure sug-
gested by Palumbo [3]. Accordingly, considering the functions p and q which are
functions of x and y as functions of x and ψ(x, y) one has

(It is noted here that a surface function ζ = ζ(x, y) ≡ ζ(ψ) can be employed

Eq. (33) describes a circle on the (x, y) plane with radius |g| centred at (−h/a, 0).

It was proved that the ideal MHD equilibrium states of a cylindrical plasma
with incompressible ﬂows and arbitrary cross section shape satisfy an elliptic
partial diﬀerential equation [Eq. (23)], which is identical to the equation gov-
erning cylindrical equilibria with purely poloidal ﬂow; the axial ﬂow velocity is

a free surface quantity. This equation permits the construction of several classes
of analytic solutions. In particular, the exact equlibrium solutions for a circular
cylindrical plasma and purely poloidal ﬂow [1] are also valid for the present case.
In addition, it was proved that the magnetic surfaces of isothermal incompressible
equilibria must have circular cross section.

It is intersting to investigate symmetric incompressible equlibria in geometries
representing more realistically the magnetic conﬁnement systems, e.g. axisym-
metric and straigth helically symmetric conﬁgurations.
In this respect it may
be noted here that, as proved in Ref. [4], the special class of axially symmetric,
incompressible, βp = 1, MHD equilibria with purely poloidal velocity does not
exist; the only possible stationary equilibria of this kind are of cylindrical shape.

ABSTRACT

This thesis presents the results of ﬁbre Z–pinch experiments carried out on the Z–150

device at the Czech Technical University in Prague. The generator that was used to drive

the experiments consisted of one capacitor of 3 µF capacitance. In the case of 20 kV

charging voltage, the current was peaking at 80 kA with a 850 ns quarter period. The Z–

pinch was formed from carbon ﬁbres of 15 µm diameter and 1 cm length. The discharge

was observed by number of diagnostics which included a voltage probe, Rogowski coil,

two ﬁltered PIN diodes, a hard X–ray detector, gated XUV spectrograph, time-integrated

X–ray pinhole camera, gated VUV pinhole camera, and schlieren system. This compre-

hensive set of diagnostics enabled us to describe the gross dynamics of the Z–pinch.

It was found out that after the breakdown a low density coronal plasma was formed

while the ﬁbre diameter remained almost unchanged. This low density corona (ion den-
sity of about 1016 cm−3) was carrying almost all the current of the order of 10 kA. When

the current had built up, i.e. after about 150 ns, the implosion of the corona onto the cen-
tral ﬁbre occurred. The implosion velocity approached the value of 2 × 105 m s−1. When

the imploded corona had reached the ﬁbre, the dip in dI/dt, voltage peak up to 10 kV,

and XUV pulse of a 10 ÷ 30 ns width were observed. XUV radiation was emitted from
several bright spots which corresponded to the interaction of m = 0 instability necks with

the dense core. The electron temperature and density were approximately 80 eV and
1019 cm−3, respectively. Although the presence of a ﬁbre did not signiﬁcantly suppress

MHD instabilities, they were not disruptive.

After the ﬁbre ablation, i.e. after 500 ns, material evaporated from electrodes started

to play a dominant role. The observed plasma column seemed to be MHD unstable and
when m = 0 instabilities had developed, XUV, soft X–ray and hard X–ray pulses were

emitted from several hot spots, particularly near the anode. At that time the voltage peak

of up to 30 kV was detected.

rameters were estimated.

In each phase of the discharge, the energetics of the Z–pinch and basic plasma pa-

INTRODUCTION

The major concern of this thesis is a Z–pinch which belongs to one of the most fascinat-

ing objects in plasma physics due to its natural occurrence and variety of applications.

A pinch is deﬁned as plasma conﬁguration in which an electric current generates mag-

netic ﬁeld that tends to conﬁne the plasma (cf. Spielman and de Groot, 2001). The preﬁx

“Z” was added in the 1950s to denote the conﬁnement driven by an axial (z) current.

Scope of Thesis: Fibre Z–pinch Experiments in Vacuum

First, it should be stressed that this thesis does not focus on Z–pinches in general but is

limited to the so–called ﬁbre Z–pinch. Z–pinches could be initiated by electrical power

sources from various discharge loads (gas, wire, low–density foam, cylindrical array of

wires, cylindrical foil, etc.), however, we are studying mainly the pinch formed from

a ﬁbre with few micrometers in diameter. In our work we distinguish between a ﬁbre and

a wire. The expression “ﬁbre” here means a wire with a very low conductivity, such as

cryogenic deuterium, deuterated polyethylene, carbon, etc. The reason for making such
distinction is that the dynamics of a ﬁbre Z–pinch substantially diﬀers from the behaviour

of a metal wire, such as aluminium, copper, gold.

Furthermore, Z–pinch discharge can occur in vacuum, gas, water, etc. So far our

research has been restricted to discharges in vacuum.

As far as the experimental study is concerned, the ﬁbre Z–pinch was carried out on

a slow current generator Z–150 at the Czech Technical University in Prague. Neverthe-
less, we also performed experiments1 on more powerful S–300 generator at Kurchatov

Institute, Moscow.

Introduction

Aim of Thesis

We aim at presenting the most important results of our Z–pinch research at the Depart-

ment of Physics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, CTU in Prague. The primary ob-

jective of our research is the description of our ﬁbre Z–pinch dynamics because to our
knowledge no systematic eﬀort has been made to study a Z–pinch initiated from a carbon

ﬁbre in vacuum using a low voltage capacitive discharge. We believe that our ﬁndings

help us to get deeper insight into processes taking place in Z–pinches.

Layout of Thesis

The thesis is organised as follows:

Chapter 1 presents a brief survey of the past and present Z–pinch research. The

emphasis is put on applications of a Z–pinch in controlled thermonuclear fusion and as

a powerful source of X–ray radiation. The last part of this chapter is devoted to ﬁbre

Z–pinches which were treated in more detail.

Chapter 2 provides basic theoretical background for equilibrium and dynamic Z–

pinches and thus creates the ground to which following chapters inevitably refer.

Chapter 3 describes in detail the current generator and diagnostics used in our exper-

iment at the Czech Technical University.

Chapter 4 brings forward the most important results we have obtained. The results

are shown chronologically, i.e. according to the phase in which they were recorded. Ex-

perimental data interpretation is given after each phase of our Z–pinch.

Chapter 5 contains the overall discussion within the framework of other experiments

too.

prospects are presented.

Finally, the main results are summarised, and conclusions together with research

BRIEF SURVEY OF Z–PINCH RESEARCH AND APPLICATION

1.1 Historical Perspective of Z–Pinches

The following section was based on Sethian (1997); Liberman et al. (1999); Ryutov et al.

(2000); Haines et al. (2000); Spielman and de Groot (2001); Sweeney (2002).

Early beginnings of Z–pinches

The ﬁrst experimental study of “Z–pinch” could be assigned to the Dutch chemist and

physicist Martinus van Marum. In the late of the 17th century, he designed and used

a large electrostatic generator (see Fig. 1.1) that was built by an English instrument–

maker John Cuthbertson in Amsterdam.

Fig. 1.1: Van Marum’s electrostatic generator in Teylers Museum (Teylers Museum, 2005).

The machine consisted of two parallel rotating glass discs (1.62 m in diameter) and

four–man power. Its 100 capacitors (“Leyden Jars”) were 4 mm thick Bohemian glass

bottles of about 35 cm diameter and 60 cm hight. The capacitance of a single jar was

3

1.1. Historical Perspective of Z–Pinches

around 5 nF and hence the total capacitance was 0.5 µF. The permissible voltage might
have been over 60 kV, in which case the bank’s energy was at least 1 kJ1. At the time

when van Marum carried out experiments with exploding wires, the expected discharge

time was about 0.5 µs and a peak current of 60 kA.

The term “pinch” and also the ﬁrst systematic research of Z–pinches, however, began
in the 20th century. In 1905, Pollock and Barraclough observed the distortion of a lighting
conductor caused by the (cid:126)j× (cid:126)B force. In 1934, W. H. Bennett derived the well–known equi-

librium of magnetically self–focusing streams of charged particles with a temperature TB

(see subsection 2.1.1 and Bennett, 1934). About three years later, L. Tonks resumed the

Bennett theory and introduced the term “pinch” to describe the self–constricted plasma.

Z–pinches for fusion

The growing interest in Z–pinches started in the 1950s in conjunction with controlled

thermonuclear fusion research. The D–T Z–pinch, in which an electric current both heats

and conﬁnes a plasma, was suggested to be a possible fusion system (see Haines, 1996).
This idea was supported by a high number of neutrons (108 per one pulse) observed in

the ﬁrst experiments with deuterium gas (20 kV capacitor bank and 1.5 µs implosion

time). Later, Anderson with his colleagues showed that neutrons were not produced by

a Maxwellian plasma. He proposed that the deuterons were accelerated by axial electric
ﬁelds created by the growth of m = 0 instabilities (Anderson et al., 1958). This was con-

sistent with Kurchatov’s explanation (Kurchatov, 1957), Kruskal’s and Schwarzschild’s

theoretical work (Kruskal and Schwarzchild, 1954), and earlier experiments carried by

Carruthers and Davenport, 1957.

Despite this fact, further experiments were carried out on the Columbus-II machine
at Los Alamos and the SuperFast Pinch (300 kA, 20 kA/ns) at Space Technology Labo-

ratories. The idea was to use a fast driver to reach fusion conditions before instabilities

could grow. Unfortunately, this approach did not achieve the results either and a plasma

still exhibited MHD instabilities.

The problem of MHD stability was investigated to a large extent also in the 1950s.
The basic stability criteria were established (Kadomtsev, 1963)2. These derived criteria

showed that it is impossible to eliminate instabilities in cylindrical conﬁgurations. For

1 With this machine, van Marum was able to create 60 cm long sparks in the air. In this experiment, the

voltage was over 330 kV and the energy was 30 kJ (Spielman and de Groot, 2001).
2 Especially the energy principle helped in quantifying plasma instabilities.

4

1.1. Historical Perspective of Z–Pinches

instance, toroidal systems of magnetic conﬁnement that were also free from electrode

phenomena seemed to be more stable. All these facts together with the conclusion that

neutrons were not of thermal origin led to the abandonment of linear Z–pinch as a fu-

sion power source. As a result, more complex schemes of magnetically conﬁned plasma

devices (such as the Tokamak) were suggested and researched in an attempt to reduce

MHD instabilities.

Z–pinches as sources of radiation

In the 1960s, Z–pinches were used as eﬃcient UV, XUV and soft X–ray sources. The
ﬁrst Z–pinch X–ray sources were exploding wires of 10 ÷ 100 µm diameters (Chace

and Moore, 1968). The typical parameter of discharges was the charging voltage of

tens of kilovolts. The capacitor banks were discharged into a load via spark gaps with

microsecond discharge time. The Z–pinch plasma reached usually the temperature of
10 ÷ 100 eV. The peak electron density was up to 1021 cm−3. Because the absorption

mean free path was less than the diameter of a plasma column, the plasma radiation was

close to the one of the blackbody.

Greater interest in Z–pinches was renewed in association with the development of

nanosecond pulsed–power technologies in the 1970s. These drivers were able to deliver

MV voltages, MA currents and TW electrical powers to a load. The new pulsed–power

generators were used to drive single wires. The limitation of a single wire was its high
initial impedance of ≈ 1 Ω that limited the conversion of the stored electrical energy to
radiation. It was found that the implosion of a plasma onto its axis is a more eﬀective way

to generate radiation than resistive and compressional heating of an equilibrium plasma

column (Linhart, 1961; Turchi and Baker, 1973; Stallings et al., 1976). For that reason,

a single wire was replaced by e.g. a cylindrical array of wires, a thin cylindrical foil,
an annular gas puﬀ, a low–density foam cylinder, etc. In these conﬁgurations, the stored

electrical energy is converted into the kinetic energy of magnetically conﬁned, imploding

plasma. At the stagnation, the kinetic energy is thermalised and the signiﬁcant part of

energy is radiated in sub-keV and keV radiation. This way, Z–pinches have become

powerful radiation sources with X–ray powers at levels previously attainable only on the

largest laser facility. Some current applications of Z–pinches as radiation sources will be

given in subsection 1.2.1.

As regards the physics of a cylindrical load, it substantially diﬀers from that of a sin-

5

1.1. Historical Perspective of Z–Pinches

gle wire or ﬁbre. In the case of a single wire with a diameter of the order of ten microm-

eters, the time needed for establishing radial equilibrium is usually much shorter than

the duration of a current pulse. That is why the pinch is assumed to be in the Bennett

equilibrium. Ohmic and compressional heating are the most important. Such pinch is

classiﬁed as equilibrium.

In the case of a cylindrical load with the initial diameter of a few centimetres, the

implosion time is comparable with the driving current pulse. When the implosion stops,

the plasma starts to expand and never reaches the Bennett–type equilibrium. The kinetic

energy of implosion is the most dominant process of energy deposition into a plasma.

Such pinches are called dynamic.

Rebirth of Z–pinch fusion research

The progress in pulsed-power technology led to new attempts in using Z–pinches in fu-
sion research. The “classical” eﬀort pursued at Imperial College, Naval Research Labo-

ratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory was to develop a stable linear Z–pinch.

One of the ﬁrst experiments was carried out with compressional Z–pinch at Imperial

College, London in the late 1970s. The Z–pinch was created in a quartz tube of 1 cm

diameter containing a deuterium ﬁlling. The discharge started on the insulating wall

and the electric current (100 kA peak, 100 ns rise time) created the imploding plasma

shell which was preceded by a shock–wave. Though a high number of neutrons was
observed (1012 neutrons per shot), a low ion temperature indicated that neutrons were not

produced by a Maxwellian plasma. Similar results were obtained at a 3 MA current on

the Angara 5-1 device in Troitsk, Soviet Union (Batyunin, 1990).

Another attempt was not only to use a fast driver to reach fusion conditions before
instabilities could grow but also to employ the eﬀect of radiative collapse (cf. subsec-

tion 2.1.2 on page 28). In order to achieve magnetic fusion, Z–pinches should operate

at the Pease–Braginski current (1.4 MA for hydrogen). Haines and Hammel derived the

current waveform that is necessary to follow so as to keep the plasma column at a con-

stant diameter. The temperature of 10 keV requires a current channels of ≈ 100 µm

diameter (Hammel et al., 1983). In order to have 100 µm current channel, it seemed

convenient to start with a small initial diameter of a plasma column. Therefore, the pinch

was initiated by a focused laser or electron beam that ionised a channel on the axis —

this is how a gas–embedded pinch is formed.

6

1.1. Historical Perspective of Z–Pinches

One of experiments with gas–embedded pinches was pursued at Los Alamos (High

Density Z–Pinch experiments). These gas–embedded experiments demonstrated the pos-
sibility of producing m = 0 stable Z–pinches (Hammel et al., 1983). However, these

pinches could not reach multi–hundred eV temperatures because they rapidly accreted

particles from the surrounding gas.

In order to overcome this problem, the research

group in Naval Research Laboratory formed the pinch inside small quartz capillary of

100 µm inner diameter. A capillary reduced the accretion and the occurrence of MHD in-

stabilities but its wall also caused rapid cooling of a plasma. It was a bad news for fusion

purposes but on the other hand it seemed promisingly for a recombination mechanism

for X–ray lasers (Rocca et al., 1988).

Diﬀerent suggestion how to overcome the accretion was to initiate Z–pinch from very

small diameter ﬁbres of cryogenic solid deuterium in vacuum (Scudder, 1985). As it is

the subject of our thesis, the research of ﬁbre Z–pinches will be described in its own

Nowadays, a simple linear Z–pinch is not considered to be a feasible source for fusion

energy (Sethian, 1997). Current applications of Z–pinches for fusion will be described in

section 1.3.

1.2. Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

1.2 Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

There are numerous applications of Z–pinches at present but among the most important

ones belong the pinches used (i) in controlled thermonuclear fusion research and (ii) as
eﬃcient sources of radiation. Since the use of a Z–pinch in fusion research is closely

connected with its application as a radiation source, we begin with the description of the

latter one ﬁrst.

1.2.1 Source of radiation

Currently, the most important application of (dynamic) Z–pinches is their use as X–ray

sources. Attractive properties of Z–pinches are mainly the simplicity of design, high
power density, high X–ray energy output, and very high eﬃciency of transformation of

stored electrical energy to radiation.

Source of blackbody radiation

Sandia’s Z machine is now the most powerful X–ray source that is capable to generate

nearly 2 MJ of thermal X–rays with a peak power of 280 TW in one pulse (Matzen, 1997;

Deeney et al., 1998; Matzen et al., 1999). More than 15% of the stored electrical energy

of 11.5 MJ is converted into X–rays. Such a high peak power and radiated energy were

achieved as a result of the implosion of very high–wire–number arrays (Sanford et al.,

1996; Deeney et al., 1997; Spielman et al., 1998) and nested wire–arrays (Deeney et al.,

1998). As the implosion of high–Z material happened in the closed cavity, the radiation

became close to the one of the blackbody.

The primary interest of the research is to use Z–pinch sources for inertial conﬁnement

fusion (see paragraph 1.2.2). However, there are other reasons for studying these X–ray

sources which are also unique for other high–energy-density physics experiments:

– the study of radiation hydrodynamics (Olson et al., 1997), radiation transport,

opacity measurements (Bailey et al., 2002a),

– the study of material properties under extreme conditions (Olson et al., 1997),

shock physics, measurement of the equation of state under multi-mega-bar pres-

sure,

1.2. Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

At this point it might be useful to give the list of the largest pulsed power facilities

used in Z–pinch mode (see Tab. 1.1). The list of devices may not be complete since there

are more pulsed power generators that can be used in Z–pinch mode. However, they are

mainly used as bremsstrahlung diodes or as accelerators of charged particles.

For next generation of Z–pinch facilities it is important to know scaling laws. There-

fore, recent experiments on Sandia’s Z machine (and be it said that not only there) were

focused on the scaling of X–ray emission with a current (Stygar et al., 2004). They
found that the total radiated X–ray energy varied as I1.73±0.18 and the peak power varied
as I1.24±0.18. Nevertheless, recent experiments close to I2 law are more perspective for

future generators.

Source of kiloelectronvolt radiation

Besides being excellent Planckian–like X–ray sources, Z–pinches are also sources of
non–LTE, K–shell or L–shell radiation. Ne, Kr or Ar gas puﬀs and Al, Ni or Ti wire–

arrays have proven to be powerful sources of kiloelectronvolt emission (see a nice review

written by Pereira and Davis, 1988). As an outstanding example we could mention San-

dia’s experiments with an argon double-shell Z–pinch. Sze et al. (2001) reported K–shell

X–ray output of 274 kJ in a 15 TW peak power and 12 ns FWHM pulse.

Long–implosion–time Z–pinches

As was mentioned above, the interest in Z–pinches was renewed with the development
of pulsed power generators that are low impedance ((cid:46) 1Ω) water–line systems producing

mega–ampere currents with 100–ns rise time. These fast high–current generators are very

large and require high voltages. In order to reduce the complexity and cost of generators,

lower voltage, long–implosion–time (0.1 µs ÷ 2 µs) plasma radiation sources (PRS) have

been studied. A comprehensive review was given by Deeney et al. (2001).

Experiments on Shiva and Pegasus drivers3,4 showed that Z–pinches with very long
implosion times (≈ 1 µs) were eﬃcient, high–yield X–ray sources but that the peak power

was not so high as in the case of 100–ns–class implosions.

The signiﬁcant increase in the radiated power was achieved when plasma ﬂow swit-

ches and ﬂux compression were used to reduce the implosion times from microseconds

to the hundreds of nanoseconds. Currently, experiments with plasma radiating sources

are being pursued on the devices listed below in Tab. 1.3.

Tab. 1.3: Basic parameters of several Z–pinches with “pulse compression”.

A longer (≈ 200 ns) implosion time is researched not only as a low–cost plasma
radiating source but also as a possible approach5 to the next generation of drivers with

the current above 20 MA. It was one of the reasons why a long–pulse mode is also

investigated on Double Eagle, Saturn and Z drivers (Deeney et al., 1999; Spielman et al.,

1998). Although it is clear that long–implosion–time Z–pinches still need to be improved,

the energy output and radiated power are comparable to those achieved with less than

100–ns implosion–times.

During the 1980s, some researchers held belief that powerful Z–pinches (such as Double

Eagle, BlackJack 5, Gamble II, and Saturn) could be used for X–ray laser pumping.

3 Their characteristics are displayed in Tab. 1.2.
4 The largest devices, such as Atlas, Shiva, etc. were not primarily built for radiation experiments but

for conducting hydrodynamic experiments supporting weapons–physics experiments.

5 The rise time of a current is given by dI/dt ≈ U/L0. Therefore, if we want to achieve higher currents

with an unchanged voltage U and inductance L0, it is necessary to prolong rise time.

X–ray laser

11

1.2. Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

There were two main reasons supporting this idea. Firstly, the Z–pinch geometry with

plasma lengths in centimetres and diameters in millimetres is naturally favourable for X–
ray lasers (Elton, 1990). Secondly, Z–pinches can eﬀectively deliver high energy density
(up to 10 MJ/cm−3) into a plasma.

As far as a pinch plasma is concerned, the population inversion was demonstrated by

resonant photopumping (Porter et al., 1992), recombination pumping (Steden and Kunze,

1990; Kunze, 1994; Shin et al., 1996; Ellwi et al., 2000, 2001; Metzner et al., 1996;

Koshelev et al., 1994; Wagner et al., 1996; Eberl et al., 1998), and pumping by charge–

exchange recombination (Koshelev et al., 1994; Koshelev and Kunze, 1997). However,

the noticeable gain length product gl and, by extension, the signiﬁcant X–ray laser output

were achieved only by collisional excitation in a capillary discharge (Rocca et al., 1994).

EUV lithography

Last but not least application that will be mentioned is EUV lithography (Bailey et al.,

1982; McGeoch, 1998). Several companies (such as XTREME technologies, CYMER
Inc., Philips, Intel, Cutting Edge Optronics) make an eﬀort to develop the most suitable

EUV source at 13.5 nm. Gas discharge–produced plasma and laser–produced plasma

belong among two prospective candidates. Both major technologies compete for high

volume manufacturing and have their pros and cons (Stamm, 2004).

1.2.2 Controlled thermonuclear fusion

For more than 50 years, scientists have been trying to harness the fusion energy for peace-

ful purposes. The fusion reaction, the fundamental energy–producing process in stars,

occurs when two nuclei of lighter elements are fused together to form a heavier element.

Among possible reactions, the highest rate has the fusion of deuterium and tritium to

helium

D + T

−→ 4

2He (3.5 MeV) + n (14.1 MeV)

The free energy of 17.6 MeV is given to the α–particle and the remaining neutron. This

fast escaping neutron can produce tritium from lithium (the material that is intended to

form the blanket surrounding a plasma)

n + 6

3Li −→ 4

2He (2.1 MeV) + T (2.7 MeV)

As deuterium can be easily extracted from water and lithium can be found in the

earth’s crust, this kind of energy could be cheap and accessible worldwide.

Unfortunately, fusion reactions take place only when the fusing nuclei are brought

close together. In order to overcome the Coulomb barrier of charged particles, the nu-
clei need to have the suﬃcient kinetic energy — the case which can happen e.g. during

collisions of ions in a high temperature plasma. However, to create a plasma with very

high temperature is not the only condition that we need in order to achieve fusion. It is
also necessary to sustain the plasma at certain density n for suﬃciently long time τ so as

a large number of fusion reactions could occur. The British physicist J. D. Lawson de-

rived a simple criterion under which a plasma will generate Q–times more energy than is

required to create and sustain it: the product of the particle density n and the conﬁnement

time τ should be higher than a certain value, in the case of a D–T mixture

nτ > Q · 1014 cm−3 s

(1.1)

Currently, the most promising concepts seem to be magnetic conﬁnement fusion (MCF)
with a long conﬁnement time (τ (cid:38) 0.1 s) and inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) with a high
density plasma (n (cid:38) 1026 cm−3). The development of both concepts has passed the stage

of Proof–of–Principle. The basic science is understood and the physics of the concept

near fusion–relevant regimes is being explored (i.e. Performance Extension).

13

1.2. Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

As far as Z–pinches are concerned, there are two substantially diﬀerent ways of their

application in the fusion research. The historically ﬁrst way is the direct heating and
conﬁning of a D–T plasma via Z–pinch eﬀect. The second approach is the use of a Z–

pinch as a driver for ICF. We shall describe the latter ﬁrst.

Z–pinch as driver for ICF

Z–pinch, more precisely Sandia’s Z machine, is the world’s most powerful laboratory

X–ray source. Such a large volume, near–Planckian X–ray source provides a well–cha-

racterised indirect driver for experiments relevant to the Inertial Conﬁnement Fusion
programme6. The high X–ray production eﬃciency ranked Z–pinch among three major
drivers for Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)7. Besides Z–pinches, lasers (KrF or DPSSL) and

heavy ion drivers (induction linacs) are considered.

In one of the most perspective concepts, the Z–pinch radiation is produced during the

collision of an imploding liner (high–Z wire–array) with an inner shell (a low density

foam “convertor”). The inward travelling shock–wave generates radiation that is trapped

by the outer imploding high–Z shell. Therefore, the shell acts as a hohlraum wall and

becomes a high temperature blackbody radiator. Later, the generated blackbody radiation

drives a spherically symmetric DT capsule in very similar way as in ICF indirectly driven

by lasers. Since the shell is moving, we call it “dynamic hohlraum” or “ﬂying radiation

case” (Smirnov, 1991).

Fig. 1.2: Dynamic hohlraum.

Fig. 1.3: Dynamic hohlraum created from two
nested wire–arrays.

6 It is possible to study ablator physics and radiation symmetrization experiments (Matzen, 1999).
7 Inertial fusion science and applications have come to be referred to as “inertial fusion energy” or IFE,
whereas “inertial conﬁnement fusion” or ICF denotes high energy density phenomena produced by either
multiple high–energy laser beams or energetic pulsed power systems (Plasmas International, 2005).

14

1.2. Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

Recently, dynamic hohlraum ICF experiments on Z accelerator have been created

from two annular tungsten wire–arrays (a 240–wire 40–mm diameter outer array and

a 120–wire 20–mm diameter inner array, see Fig. 1.3, Bailey et al., 2002b; Slutz et al.,

2003a; Bailey et al., 2004; Ruiz et al., 2004). This way, a deuterium–ﬁlled capsule ab-

sorbed ≈ 24 kJ of X–rays from a ≈ 220 eV dynamic hohlraum. The thermonuclear
neutron yield from the D–D reaction was up to 8 × 1010 which is the highest D–D neutron

yield ever reached with X–ray drivers. Argon spectra conﬁrmed a hot fuel with electron
temperature and density of 1 keV and (1 ÷ 4) × 1023 cm−3, respectively. The temperature
of ions inferred from the neutron energy distribution was 4.8 ± 1.5 keV. All these val-

ues show that the dynamic hohlraum can produce high temperature radiation and deliver

a large amount of energy into the ICF capsule. However, in order to achieve higher con-

vergence ratio, it is necessary to improve radiation symmetry control. Therefore, other

complementary indirect drive concepts for high–yield IFE are being explored.

The seriously investigated concept of a double–pinch hohlraum is shown in Fig. 1.4.

This concept used two dynamic hohlraums to drive a static–walled hohlraum. Experi-

ments on Z machine demonstrated a 70 eV hohlraum temperature, 3% drive symmetry

and 14 ÷ 20 convergence ratio (Cuneo et al., 2002).

Fig. 1.4: Static hohlraum with two Z–pinch radiation sources at the ends.

The results of the past ten years were so attractive that the Z–pinch IFE Road Map and

the concept of power plant were developed (Rochau et al., 2003). The design of high–

yield dynamic hohlraum includes a single 12 MJ, 54 MA Z–pinch driver that produces

a 350 eV radiation temperature, 2.4 MJ absorbed capsule energy and 550 MJ thermonu-

clear yield (Lash et al., 2000). Yet, before the high–yield 60 MA driver “ZX” can be

constructed, the 26 MA refurbished Z machine “ZR” must ﬁrst provide scaling informa-

tion on a capsule (Weinbrecht et al., 2003).

15

1.2. Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

The present eﬀort is thus concentrated on demonstrating single–shot, high–yield fu-
sion capsules. However, the rep–rated (≈ 0.1 Hz) Z–pinch is needed for IFE (Slutz et al.,

2003c). As a possible rep–rated pulsed power technology, linear transformer drivers

(LTD) could be applied. The necessary separation between the fusion target and the

power plant should be provided by a recyclable transmission line (Slutz et al., 2003b). It

is planned that 1 MA driver Z–PoP (Proof–of–Principle, 1 MV voltage, 100 ns rise time,

0.1 Hz repetition) will be constructed in near future.

In spite of a rapid progress in Z–pinch driven ICF, many questions have remained to

be answered. We mention at least some of them here:

– How to achieve spherically symmetric irradiation of the capsule when a Z–pinch is

cylindrical by nature?

– How to control the shape and intensity of the X–ray pulse?

– How to prevent the early preheating of the capsule?

– How to mitigate gross hydrodynamic instabilities, e.g. Rayleigh–Taylor instability?

It is apparent that more experiments on these issues are still needed. Unfortunately,

the number of shots on powerful devices is limited. Smaller–scale experiments are there-

fore used to elucidate Z–pinch physics.

Several smaller–scale experiments focus on the eﬀect of a single wire because it

helps to understand the initiation stage of wire–array Z–pinches (e.g. initial energy de-

position, expansion rates, seeding of instabilities that later inﬂuence Rayleigh–Taylor

instability, etc.). These experiments are pursued e.g. at Sandia National Laboratories,

Albuquerque (Sarkisov et al., 2004), Imperial College, London (Lebedev et al., 2000,

2001), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (Johnston et al., 2003), Cornell University,

Ithaca (Kalantar and Hammer, 1993; Pikuz et al., 1999b,a; Sinars et al., 2000b,a; Ham-

mer and Sinars, 2001; Duselis et al., 2004), University of Nevada, Reno (NTF, 2005).

The study of the initial stage of a discharge allowed to improve MHD capability in-

cluding a “cold–start”. Recently, 3D resistive MHD simulation of wire–array Z–pinches

have been developed (Eulerian code “Gorgon”, Chittenden et al., 2004, and Arbitrary–

Lagrangian–Eulerian code ALEGRA–HEDP, Garasi et al., 2004).

16

1.2. Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

Direct heating and conﬁning of a fusion plasma via Z–pinch eﬀect

The other mentioned approach of the Z–pinch use in the fusion research is the direct
heating and conﬁning of a fusion plasma via pinch eﬀect. The accomplishment of this

goal has been somewhat problematic from the beginning of Z–pinch research (see sub-

section 1.1). There were serious doubts about issues of crucial importance, such as how

to suppress magnetohydrodynamic instabilities and the interaction of the plasma with a

wall? Since the early attempts, a large number of ideas have been proposed to overcome
these diﬃculties:

– A quasiequilibrium Z–pinch with direct heating of a DT mixture (e.g. cryogenic

DT ﬁbre, see subsection 1.3).

– Staged pinch. In this case, the azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld (generated by the current

ﬂowing in a DT ﬁbre) is compressed by an imploding liner. When the imploding

liner approaches the ﬁbre, the inductance of the ﬁbre decreases, the current in the

ﬁbre rapidly increases, and the ﬁbre is heated and compressed (Rahman et al.,

1995).

– Z–pinch stabilised by a strong axial ﬂow. What happens here is that a plasma is
accelerated between two coaxial electrodes and after that the Z–pinch eﬀect occurs.

This concept is very similar to a plasma focus.

– Adiabatic compression and heating of a DT plasma during cylindrically or spheri-

cally symmetric implosion of a liner (Degnan, 1995).

– Magnetised Target Fusion. This concept is based on adiabatic compression of

a magnetised plasma. In comparison with the previous concept, the heat losses
from the fusion plasma to walls are suppressed by weak magnetic ﬁeld with β (cid:38) 1.

As examples of the MTF concept we can mention (i) the compression of ﬁeld
reverse conﬁguration (Ryutov and Siemon, 2001) and (ii) the MAGO8 project of

Los Alamos National Laboratory and All–Russian Scientiﬁc Research Institute of

Experimental Physics (Lindemuth et al., 1995).

– High yield systems. They are characterised by the propagating of a nuclear burn

wave that is ignited in some part of a cylindrical column, e.g. in the neck of an
m = 0 instability (Linhart, 1994; Chittenden et al., 2005).

17

1.2. Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

All these concepts have not been explored to such an extent as ICF and MFC were.

Thus one may ask what the motive for such alternative approaches is.

One of the main reasons is that the region between conventional magnetic fusion
(ne (cid:46) 1014 cm−3) and inertial fusion (ne (cid:38) 1026 cm−3) oﬀers vast possibilities for smaller
and cheaper fusion experiments (Siemon et al., 1999). We often speak about Magneto–

Inertial Fusion that represents the all–inclusive set of inertially conﬁned approaches to

fusion that involve magnetic ﬁeld in an essential way. Magnetic ﬁeld is then used to

suppress the heat ﬂow from the inertially conﬁned plasma and therefore requirements on

fusion drivers could be reduced.

18

1.2. Present State and Applications of Z–Pinches

1.2.3 Other applications

Except the above mentioned applications of a Z–pinch, there are yet other possibilities of

using this device. The following list brieﬂy summarises few of them:

– Lab–astrophysics (Ryutov and Remington, 2002). The generation of highly super-

sonic plasma jets with MACH number of 50 can serve as an example (Lebedev

– Controlled generation of high magnetic ﬁelds (≈ 1000 T) by magnetic ﬁeld com-

pression in an imploding cylindrical shell (Felber et al., 1985).

– Generation of charged and neutral particles for industrial, scientiﬁc and medical

– Optical guidance of terrawatt laser pulses in a capillary discharge (Hosokai et al.,

et al., 2002).

– Spectroscopy of highly charged ions (Pereira and Davis, 1988).

1.3. Fibre Z–pinch

1.3 Fibre Z–pinch

1.3.1 Cryogenic deuterium ﬁbres

The high density Z–pinches formed from dielectric ﬁbres were investigated in the 1980s

and 1990s in connection with the research of controlled thermonuclear fusion and radia-

tive collapse (see subsection 2.1.2). The notion was to heat and ionise the ﬁbre from

frozen deuterium and to conﬁne the high density and high temperature plasma column

within a small diameter.

The ﬁrst experiments were performed at Naval Research Laboratory (Sethian et al.,

1987) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (Scudder, 1985; Hammel and Scudder, 1987).

Z–pinch plasma in these experiments seemed to be stable for many radial Alfv´en tran-
sit times (cf. Eq. 2.27 on page 31), whereas the neutron yield approached 1010. This

promising result led to the modiﬁcation of the Z–pinch theory when the arbitrary cur-

rent distribution (Coppins, 1989), resistivity (Cochran and Robson, 1990b; Culverwell

and Coppins, 1990), viscosity (Cochran and Robson, 1990a), the Hall term and electron

pressure gradient in Ohm’s law (Coppins et al., 1984), pressure anisotropy (Coppins and
Scheﬀel, 1992), etc. were included in ﬂuid models. Further, ﬁnite ion Larmor radius ef-
fects were calculated via Vlasov–ﬂuid model (Scheﬀel et al., 1997). Nevertheless, none

of these improvements could explain the experimentally observed stability (see a nice

review of the Z–pinch stability written by Coppins, 1997). With the use of a “cold–

start” MHD simulation, Lindemuth et al. (1989) calculated that the enhanced stability

was due to the presence of the solid core of a ﬁbre which lasted for a very long time. The

subsequent calculation showed that rather than enhancing the stability, the core partially

masked the evidence of instabilities (Lindemuth, 1990; Sheehey et al., 1992). Similarly

discouraging results were obtained from further and better diagnosed experiments on new

generators at NRL (Sethian et al., 1990b) and Los Alamos (Scudder et al., 1990) as well

as on KALIF at Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe (Kies et al., 1991) and on MAGPIE

at Imperial College in London (Lebedev et al., 1998).

1.3.2 Carbon and deuterated polyethylene ﬁbres

The ﬁbres from carbon and deuterated polymer were also employed in the Z–pinch exper-

iments because their discharge behaviour was roughly the same as the frozen deuterium

ones (Lebedev et al., 1998; Riley et al., 1996); at the same time they were easily avail-

able and could be handled much easier. The main diﬀerence is an atomic number (Z = 1
for hydrogen or deuterium, and Z = 6 for carbon). Furthermore, carbon or deuterated

polymer ﬁbres radiate more than pure deuterium ﬁbres. The carbon and polymer ﬁbres

also require more energy for producing fully stripped ions.

Stephanakis et al. (1972) pursued the ﬁrst experiments with deuterated polymer ﬁbre

on the Gamble II facility in the 1970s. The number of detected neutrons exceeded the
value of 1010. From that time on, several tens of experiments with carbon and deuterated

polymer ﬁbres were performed but the neutron yield has never been higher. The list of
most important experiments is displayed in Tab. 1.4, 1.5 and 1.69. The results of these

experiments – those that are relevant to our work – are given in the discussion part in

chapter 5.

1.3.3 Contemporary state of art

To our knowledge, the last experiments with deuterium ﬁbres were performed in the late

1990s and the idea of nuclear fusion and radiative collapse in ﬁbre Z–pinches was aban-

doned. During that period of time, the theory and MHD modelling were improved to

such a degree that it was possible to explain gross dynamics of the discharge as well as

a few “ﬁne” phenomena (e.g. Chittenden et al., 1997) of ﬁbre Z–pinches. However, sev-

eral key–points (such as the mechanism of neutron production, the generation of electron

and ion beams, etc.) remained still unresolved.

1.3.4 Fibre Z–pinch drivers

All the above cited experiments utilised high–voltage pulsed–power systems instead of

a simple capacitor bank. According to Mitchell et al. (1996), there were two principal

reasons:

column.

– High voltage transients caused by changes of plasma inductance and resistance

could damage low impedance and low voltage capacitors.

– The current rise must be fast enough to prevent the early expansion of a plasma

9 The list does not include experiments with glass and polyamide ﬁbres because only fragmentary results
were published. The only exception is Figura’s experiment on the IMP generator at Imperial College in
London (Figura et al., 1991).

1.3.5 Our experiment

Our research is based on the results from a carbon ﬁbre Z–pinch driven by a slow

(microsecond–long) capacitive discharge. The purpose of this small scale experiment
is a detailed description of ﬁbre Z–pinch dynamics10. On one hand, the use of a capacitor

as a current generator has the aforementioned disadvantages, but on the other hand, it

could provide new experimental results which can be compared with those obtained at

more powerful devices. We hope that this comparison will enable us better understanding

of general characteristics of ﬁbre Z–pinches. Also, we would like to take the advantage

of a small–scale experiment which could be easily modiﬁed and, in some cases, better

diagnosed, while it remains interesting from the physical point of view.

10 Our experiment also serves for preparing diagnostics which is used on more powerful current genera-
tors (e.g. S–300 generator at Kurchatov Institute in Moscow and plasma focus PF–1000 at IPPLM institute
in Warsaw.).

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

This chapter provides theoretical background upon which the thesis is based. Because the
dominant physical processes of equilibrium and dynamic pinches are substantially diﬀer-

ent, it might raise a question of what kind of pinch we are actually describing here. The

title clearly suggests that our work is devoted mainly to a ﬁbre Z–pinch. One can there-

fore expect an equilibrium pinch. However, as it will be shown later, many phenomena

of dynamic pinches were also observed in our experiments. That’s why this theoretical

background comprises both equilibrium pinches and dynamic pinches.

2.1 Equilibrium Z–pinches

2.1.1 Bennett equilibrium (Liberman et al., 1999)

Steady–state equilibrium of a Z–pinch can be derived from Maxwell’s equations and

the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations in which we set the velocity and all time

derivatives to zero. We obtain so–called magnetostatic equations for perfectly conducting

plasma

By excluding the current density (cid:126)j from equations 2.1 and 2.2, we get

The Z–pinch is a cylindrically symmetric plasma column and therefore all quantities are
function only of the radial coordinate r, i.e. ∂/∂z = 0 and ∂/∂θ = 0. Thus, the basic radial

pressure balance relation for a Z–pinch is

Next, we assume the current ﬂowing along the z axis. Since we do not consider external

magnetic ﬁeld Bz, Amper’s law 2.2 gives only one non–zero component of magnetic ﬁeld,

namely azimuthal one Bθ. Then equation 2.7 reduces to

The ﬁrst term in equation 2.8 represents the gradient of the magnetic and kinetic pressure.

The second term is the tension force generated by the curvature of the azimuthal magnetic

ﬁeld. This “curvature force” acts towards ﬁeld’s line centre of curvature. Since we have

only one equation 2.9 for two independent functions p(r) and Bθ(r), one of them can be

taken arbitrary. From experimentalist’s point of view, it is convenient to choose arbitrarily

the magnetic ﬁeld Bθ(r) and hence the current I(r). If we introduce Amper’s law

into equation 2.9, we ﬁnd that

Substituting Ni and TB in 2.12, we easily ﬁnd the well–known Bennett condition in the

It follows that the lower line density Ni is, the higher plasma temperature TB can be
achieved. However, if the line density Ni is too low, microinstabilities driven by the

current can be triggered (see paragraph 2.1.3).

2.1.2 Pease–Braginskii current and radiative collapse

The balance between the kinetic and magnetic pressure is not the only condition that

is necessary for a steady–state equilibrium. The Z–pinch in radial equilibrium should

satisfy also the energy balance. If we neglect axial heat losses absorbed by the electrodes,

is known as the Pease–Braginskii current. Its value for a deuterium plasma2 is IPB ≈
1.4 MA.

The pinch radius does not change only if the current is equal to the Pease–Braginskii

one. At currents above this value, radiation losses exceed Joule heating, which results,

according to the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, in the negative value of the external work

pdV. Hence, the pinch radius decreases. In other words, the pinch undergoes a sponta-

neous contraction and the radiative collapse occurs. The collapse will continue until the

opacity and degeneracy of electron gas begin to play their role.

In this connection it is important to note that the value of the Pease–Braginskii current

could be substantially changed by anomalous resistivity, leakage currents, axial magnetic

ﬁeld, resonant line and recombination radiation, opacity, axial and radial heat losses, par-

ticle losses, etc. From the experimental point of view, we could mention the inﬂuence of

the decreasing pinch radius and increasing plasma inductance which can lead to the drop

of the electric current delivered from an external generator. However, what we would like

to point out is that whatever the critical current is, the energy balance determines whether

the pinch expands or collapses.

2 Coulomb logarithm equals ln Λ ≈ 10.

2.1.3

Ideal MHD stability of equilibrium Z–pinch

The stability of Z–pinches is a primary object of interest because the plasma has to be
stable for a suﬃciently long conﬁnement time in order to burn thermonuclear reactions.

During the early stage of fusion research it was shown that linear Z–pinches are highly

MHD unstable. During the last decades, linear and non–linear analysis of magnetohy-

drodynamic and kinetic instabilities was undertaken and stability criteria were deduced.

With reference to this thesis, we will restrict ourselves to basic deﬁnitions and results of

linear theory.

Linear perturbation theory

As far as the linear perturbation theory is concerned, the starting point is a set of linearised

MHD equations. We assume the plasma to be in the steady–state equilibrium. After that

we perturb slightly this equilibrium. We take the advantage of linear theory and use the

Fourier analysis to express the Lagrangian displacement

(cid:126)ξ((cid:126)r, t) = (cid:126)ξ0((cid:126)r)ei(mθ+kz)+Γt

(2.21)

where Re(Γ) is the growth rate, m and k are azimuthal and axial wave numbers.

The nomenclature of instabilities could be derived from the previous equation 2.21:

MHD instabilities are often classiﬁed according to the azimuthal wave number m. The
sausage (axisymmetric) instability corresponds to m = 0, whereas the kink (helical) in-
stability to m = 1.

Since all perturbed quantities are expressed in terms of displacement vector (cid:126)ξ((cid:126)r, t),
the set of diﬀerential MHD equations can be converted to algebraical ones (with respect
to time). Consequently, the solution of algebraical equations could provide eigenvalues Γ
and thus the answer about stability. If Re(Γ) is negative, we speak about the exponentially

stable system. Unfortunately, in the case of the Bennett equilibrium and the ideal MHD
model, the growth rate of an m = 0 instability is positive of the order of

Physical mechanisms of the sausage an kink instabilities

A simple physical interpretation of the sausage and kink instability is illustrated in Fig. 2.1

and 2.2. If we imagine a plasma column in MHD equilibrium and with the axisymmetric

perturbation (cf. Fig. 2.1, Hor´ak and Krupka, 1981) then the toroidal loops of magnetic

ﬁeld will be shrunk in the neck. The magnetic ﬁeld in the neck increases and cannot be
balanced by the kinetic pressure. The rise of the Lorentz force (cid:126)j × (cid:126)B causes the growth

of a perturbation. The characteristic velocity of the perturbation growth is that of a fast

magnetosonic wave vA.

31

2.1. Equilibrium Z–pinches

The bending of a plasma column (cf. Fig. 2.2) demonstrates the same eﬀect. The ﬁeld

strength is intensiﬁed along the inner face of the bend and reduced along the outer face.

Thereby the instability will be ampliﬁed.

Stability criteria

The necessary and suﬃcient condition for the m = 0 and m ≥ 1 stability of Z–pinch
was given by Kadomtsev (1963). He showed that the Z–pinch is stable against m = 0

instabilities if the pressure proﬁle fulﬁls the following inequality for all r

(2.28)

where γ = cp/cV is the ratio of speciﬁc heats and β(r) = 2µp(r)/B2
θ(r) is the ratio of the
kinetic and magnetic pressure. Since the pressure of a ﬁbre pinch3 falls to zero at the
vacuum–plasma boundary, the pinch is always m = 0 unstable.

As far as m ≥ 1 modes are concerned, the current density proﬁle has to satisfy the

condition (Liberman et al., 1999)

The analysis of this expression shows that every Z–pinch with the ﬁnite (non–singular)
current density at the axis is m = 1 unstable.

Applicability of ideal MHD and non-ideal regimes of Z–pinches

The ideal MHD stability theory predicts the growth of instabilities on the Alfv´en time

scale. However, ideal MHD neglects resistivity, viscosity, thermal conduction, the ﬁnite

ion Larmor radius, and other phenomena which may modify the instability growth time.

In order to be valid, ideal MHD requires that the plasma fulﬁls the following conditions:

– First, the plasma must have a low resistivity which is usually quantiﬁed by the
Lundquist number S = µσvAR (the ratio between the Lorentz force and resis-
tive magnetic diﬀusion force). Culverwell and Coppins (1990) found the critical
Lundquist number S ∗ below which the enhanced stability is predicted. This crit-

ical Lundquist number depends on kR (k is the axial wave number and R is the

32

2.1. Equilibrium Z–pinches

pinch radius) and, typically, one can take this number of 10 ÷ 100 (cf. Coppins and

Culverwell, 1997).

– Second, the plasma must be highly collisional. In other words, the ion–ion collision

time should be lower than the characteristic MHD time, i.e. Γτi < 1.

– Third, the ion Larmor radius must be small in comparison to the pinch radius,
i.e. ρi/R (cid:28) 1. Otherwise it is necessary to describe a collisional plasma by the Hall
ﬂuid model where the Hall term and the electron pressure gradient are included

in Ohm’s law. When a plasma is collisionless, the Vlasov ﬂuid model is more

appropriate. In the regime where the ion Larmor radius is large ρi/R > 0.1 and
ions are magnetised ωciτi > 1, there is some theoretical and experimental evidence

of reduction of instability growth rates.

Assuming the pinch in the Bennett equilibrium, these three dimensionless parameters
(S , Γτi, ρi/R) are functions of only two parameters, namely the ion line density Ni and
If we plot I4R

against Ni, we obtain the diagram of the stability regimes (Haines and Coppins, 1991). In

this diagram, the ideal MHD region occupies a fairly small space of the experimentally

relevant regions.

Microinstabilities and turbulences

Microinstabilities4 are excited in a plasma when the drift velocity of electrons vDe =
jz/ene exceeds the critical velocity which is typically of the order of the ion sound speed
cs =
k(Ti + ¯zTe)/Mi. As a result, turbulences of electrostatic and electromagnetic ﬁeld
cause drifting electrons to be scattered. Since electrons are now scattered both from

√

individual ions and from turbulent electromagnetic ﬁeld, the anomalous contribution to

resistivity has to be considered. This anomalous resistivity can occur not only in the neck
of an m = 0 instability, but also in a low density plasma boundary. In this region, the

drift velocity vDe can grow to a higher value because the electron density approaches zero
ne → 0 and the current density jz is ﬁnite.

4 Lower hybrid and ion acoustic instabilities are usually most relevant in high–density Z–pinches (Ryu-

tov et al., 2000).

2.2. Dynamic Z–pinches

2.2 Dynamic Z–pinches

Most of the Z–pinches, including our ﬁbre Z–pinch, are in radial equilibrium for a very

short period, if at all. Therefore, the fully consistent approach requires to consider Z–

pinch dynamics. The ﬂuid dynamics can be described by the Euler equation of motion

included, whereas the momentum5 of accreting material −ρ˙r2, viscous force η∆(cid:126)v and

other terms are neglected. To express the radial component of the previous equation, we

2.2.2 Stability of dynamic pinches

It follows that the implosion velocity is increasing with the decreasing pinch radius R(t).

Because the dependence is logarithmic and in addition to that in the square root, the

implosion velocity vimp is of the order of the Alfv´en velocity

The dynamic and equilibrium pinches diﬀer in the extent to which instabilities matter in
each case. The important diﬀerence arises from the fact that implosion/explosion takes

a ﬁnite time, whereas a steady–state plasma is supposed to last for ever. For instance,
instabilities with growth rates Γ (cid:28) vA/R are much more important in equilibrium pinches
than in dynamic ones (Ryutov et al., 2000). Regarding the Rayleigh–Taylor instability,

it plays a crucial role in all dynamic pinches, whereas in equilibrium pinches it does not

develop.

35

2.2. Dynamic Z–pinches

Rayleigh–Taylor instability

The RT instability is universal and occurs in all accelerating/decelerating systems where

a high density ﬂuid is “supported” by a lower density one. The growth rate of perturba-

tions for a liquid supported by gravity is (Liberman et al., 1999)

Γ = (cid:112)

gk

(2.44)

where k = 2π/λ is the wave number of instability and g is the (gravitational) acceleration.

In dynamic pinches, the gravity is represented by the magnetic ﬁeld during the implosion

and by the kinetic pressure during the explosion. It follows from equation 2.44 that the
growth rate Γ is unlimited with increasing wave numbers k. However, for high wave num-
bers the dissipative eﬀects (such as ﬁnite viscosity, thermal conductivity and resistivity)

have to be considered. As a result, the maximum growth rate is ﬁnite.

Finally, we would like to mention the stabilising eﬀect of the snowplough implosion.

Although the mass accretion during the implosion could be destabilising, the reduction
of the acceleration and the eﬀect of the foregoing shock wave ﬁnally lead to the eﬀective

mitigation of RT instabilities.

APPARATUS AND DIAGNOSTICS

This chapter deals with the experimental set–up of a Z–150 Z–pinch1 (see Fig. 3.1), which

is located at the Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

This small device was employed for our ﬁbre Z–pinch experiments, the results of which

are presented in this thesis. During the past four years, we carried out more than 500 shots
in a few series under diﬀerent experimental conditions. The following sections describe

the current generator, experimental chamber, Z–pinch load, and diagnostics. First of all,

however, we introduce the block diagram and electrical scheme of the Z–150.

3.2 Current Generator

The generator used to drive recent experiments2 consisted of one capacitor with the ca-
pacitance of C0 = 3 µF. The basic parameters of the generator were estimated from the
damped oscillation of a “short” circuit, i.e. with short–circuited electrodes (cf. Fig. 3.4

and 3.5).

Fig. 3.4: “Short” circuit.

Since it was a simple R0 − L0 − C0 circuit in which the capacitor C0 was discharged

to a L0 − R0 load, we could expect the time dependence of dI/dt to be

When a 15 µm carbon ﬁbre was used as a load (see Fig. 3.6), the plasma resistance
RP and inductance LP deeply aﬀected the current waveform, especially dI/dt. In the case
of a 20 kV charging voltage, the current was peaking at ≈ 80 kA with a rise time of

650 ÷ 800 ns. More details about our calibration of an electric current will be given in

The experimental chamber of a 6.5 cm height and 8 cm diameter was made of stainless

steel (see Fig. 3.7 and 3.8). Its diameter was small in order to keep an inductance low.

Altogether eight diagnostic ports were available. The size of four diagnostic ports was

matched with the vacuum ﬁtting NW40 and the size of the other four ports ﬁtted with

NW16.

Fig. 3.8: End-on view of the experimental chamber (without the upper cover).

The electrode system and ﬁxing of carbon ﬁbres varied during our experiment. As

we wanted to distinguish general features of the experiment from speciﬁc ones, we per-
formed a few experimental series with electrodes from diﬀerent materials (copper, steel,
brass, and bronze) and of diﬀerent shapes (ﬂat, conical, “bisectional”). The example of

brass conical electrodes can be seen in Fig. 3.9.

Carbon ﬁbres were mounted between the live anode and the cathode that were isolated

from each other by an alkaline polyamide spacer. The dI/dt probe was placed near the

cathode, in the upper cover of the experimental chamber (see Fig. 3.10).

The chamber was evacuated to a pressure of 10−2 Pa. The vacuum was reached with

the aid of three Leybold Turbovac50 turbo pumps which were backed by one rotary

pump.

3.4 Z–pinch Load

Our Z–pinch was initiated from carbon ﬁbres of various lengths and diameters. The

carbon ﬁbres of 15 µm diameter and 7 ÷ 9 mm length were most frequently used but
also ﬁbres with 6 and 80 µm diameter have been tried3. Some of important properties of

carbon are presented in Tab. 3.3 and 3.4.

It is well known that Z–pinch dynamics is substantially determined by initial phys-

ical properties of a Z–pinch load. The characteristic initial physical property of carbon

ﬁbres is their high resistivity. The measured resistance of a 15 µm carbon ﬁbre was ap-
proximately 7 kΩ cm−1. As far as the inductance of a 1 cm long ﬁbre is concerned, the

3 We preferred 15 µm ﬁbres for three reasons: (i) they could be entirely ablated, (ii) the peak electron

temperature exceeded 60 eV, and (iii) the discharge reproducibility was the best among tested ﬁbres.

3.5 Diagnostics

This subsection brings forward the description of various diagnostic tools that were em-

ployed to observe plasma dynamics. The diagnostic set–up that we have used most re-

cently is displayed in Fig. 3.11.

The ﬁgure shows that the radiation emitted from the plasma was recorded with two

ﬁltered PIN diodes, a hard X–ray detector (PMT and scintillator BCF-12), a gated XUV

spectrograph, a time–integrated X–ray pinhole camera, and a gated VUV pinhole cam-

era. The laser probing enabled the visualization of the electron density gradient by the

schlieren method. The electrical characteristics of the Z–pinch discharge were monitored

by a voltage probe and Rogowski coil.

3.5.1 Voltage probe

The P6015 Tektronix high–voltage probe (attenuation 1000×, loading 100 MΩ and 3 pF)

was used to monitor the voltage between the electrodes. This probe was developed for

measurement of pulses up to 40 kV. The 75 MHz bandwidth and 4 ns rise–time enabled

to capture fast changes. The most important characteristics are displayed in Tab. 3.5.

3.5.2 Rogowski coil

The Rogowski coil – in other words a toroidal coil with multiple turns, was used to

measure a pulsed current in the discharge, or to be more precise the circuit dI/dt. The

current I ﬂowing through the upper (grounded) electrode also ﬂew through the Rogowski

coil. The alternating current dI/dt and hence alternating magnetic ﬂux then induced the

voltage LCdiC/dt inside the current probe.

As the coil was connected via 50 Ω coaxial cable to the resistor RL = 50 Ω, we can

where RC and LC are the resistance and inductance of the Rogowski coil, respectively.
In our case, the inductance of the Rogowski coil LC was about 400 nH. Hence, the term
LCdiC/dt was negligible compared with RLiC for frequencies smaller than RL/(2πLC) ≈
20 MHz. Under this frequency condition and for RC (cid:28) RL, the output voltage at the
oscilloscope was proportional to the derivative of the current

During the last experiments, the Rogowski coil was replaced by the solenoid with the
inductance of LS = 30 nH. It means that we measured dI/dt again, but for frequencies up
to RL/(2πLS) ≈ 250 MHz.

Calibration

The Rogowski coil was calibrated by discharging a capacitor into a short circuit (cf.

Fig. 3.4 and subsection 3.2). In this simple case, the absolute value of a current could be

calculated and thus the current probe could be calibrated against this known value. The

current in a short circuit was evaluated as follows:

a short circuit was simply obtained4.

3.5.3 Filtered PIN diodes

The temporal evolution of XUV and X–ray radiation was detected by two ﬁltered PIN–Si
diodes. These PIN diodes were produced by RNDr. Ivo Benc, CSc. in “V ´UVET” institu-

tion. They were operating as current generators in the reverse bias mode. The equivalent

circuit is displayed in Fig. 3.13.

Fig. 3.13: Reverse bias connection of PIN diodes.

These two PIN diodes were diﬀerentially ﬁltered by a 15 µm thick Be ﬁlter and 0.8 µm
thick Al foil. The spectral responsivity Ri of ﬁltered PIN diodes was calculated as fol-
lows:

In order to create electron–hole pairs, photons have to be transmitted by a ﬁlter and

a dead layer. At the same time, photons have to be absorbed in the sensitive (intrinsic)

layer of a PIN diode. The energy needed for the creation of one electron–hole pair in
silicon is w ≈ 3.62 eV at room temperature. The quantum eﬃciency5 η can be thus

estimated

η = hν
w

e−(µFdF+µDdD)(1 − e−µSdS)

where µF, µD and µS represent absorption coeﬃcients of a ﬁlter, dead layer and sensitive
layer, respectively. Quantities dF, dD and dS are thicknesses of relevant layers.

Once the quantum eﬃciency is known, the spectral responsivity Ri can be derived

from the ratio of the photocurrent iPIN and incident power Φ as

Substituting η from Eq. 3.10 into Eq. 3.11 we obtain

e−(µFdF+µDdD)(1 − e−µSdS)

(3.12)

To calculate responsivities of our PIN diodes, we considered the thickness of a Si sensi-
tive layer to be dS = 10 µm and the thickness of a dead layer to be dD = 0.1 µm. The
spectral dependencies of transmission for ﬁlters, a sensitive layer and dead layer were

calculated with Henke’s data (Henke et al., 1993) provided by a Berkeley lab’s web-

site (CXRO, 2004). The transmissions of two Al foils and a 15 µm thick Be ﬁlter are

displayed in Fig. 3.14. The spectral responsivities of PIN diodes with these ﬁlters are

shown in Fig. 3.15.

The sensitive area of our PIN diodes was 1 mm2 and hence we expected the time–
response of approximately t10%−90% ≈ 1 ns. As far as the location is concerned, PIN
diodes were placed approximately 20 ÷ 25 cm away from the plasma. Most often we

employed uncollimated PIN diodes. However, collimators were used once or twice to

avoid the radiation from electrodes. Finally we make a note that PIN diodes are sensitive

to high energy particles, particularly the inﬂuence of electrons should be considered.

3.5.4 Hard X–ray detector

The combination of a scintillator and photomultiplier was used to detect the time evo-

lution of hard X–ray emission. To put it simply, the principle of the detection can be

described as follows: an X–ray photon falls upon a scintillation material and produces

higher number of visible photons which can be detected with a photomultiplier. In our

case, the scintillating ﬁbre Bicron BCF–12 (1 mm diameter and 4 cm length) was fol-

lowed by the HAMAMATSU H1949–51 photomultiplier tube.

The Bicron ﬁbre consists of a polystyrene–based core and a PMMA cladding (see
table 3.6). Scintillation eﬃciency for the blue emitting BCF–12 is approximately 2.4%.

PMT’s parameters are summarised in Tab. 3.7. The HV power supply (HVPS–4) for

the PMT tube was developed in the Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion

(IPPLM) in Warsaw. The applied voltage determined the transit time of electrons. In the

case of often used 1.8 ÷ 2.0 kV, the delay of the photomultiplier tube was 35 ÷ 30 ns.

In order to shield background radiation, the scintillation ﬁbre was surrounded by

a plastic cone of 6 cm diameter. As far as the energy of detected photons is concerned, it

was predetermined by a ﬁlter placed in front of the scintillator. The transmission of used

ﬁlters (100 µm or 750 µm thick Al ﬁlter) is displayed in Fig. 3.16. This ﬁgure clearly

shows that a 100 µm and 750 µm Al ﬁlter transmits photons with energy higher than

5 keV and 10 keV, respectively.

3.5.5 XUV spectrograph

In this subsection, let us present the spectrograph we used in our experiment. Since XUV

spectroscopy was one of the most important contribution of the author to the experiment,

the part below covers the subject in more detail. In addition to that, principles of spec-

troscopy and methods applied in the thesis can be found in appendix A.

XUV and X–ray spectral range

Due to the fact that the temperature of Z–pinches varies from several eVs up to tens

of keV, a predominant fraction of the electromagnetic radiation is emitted in the XUV

and X–ray spectral region. The boundaries of XUV and X–ray ranges are not rigid,

but as such traditionally accepted in the ﬁelds of X–ray spectroscopy, plasma physics,

astrophysics, X–ray laser etc. For the purpose of this paper, we use the wavelength

ranges displayed in table 3.8.

Tab. 3.8: Deﬁnition of wavelength ranges used in our work (Pikuz, 2001).

Basic principles of XUV spectrographs

Our XUV spectrograph was used to give information about the spectral characteristics

of radiation emitted from a ﬁbre Z–pinch. Since we were interested in K– and L–shell

emission of carbon ions in particular, we were limited mainly to the XUV spectral region

from 2 to 50 nm, i.e. approximately from 20 to 600 eV. The construction of a spectrograph

in this spectral region is determined by three important factors.

Firstly, a high resonance absorption in all materials must be considered. It means that

spectrographs have to be evacuated and transmission through whatever materials should

be restricted. In other words, reﬂecting elements are preferred.

Secondly, in order to obtain high dispersion and, by extension, high spectral resolu-

tion, it is necessary to have the characteristic period of a dispersing element of the order

of the wavelength, i.e. several nanometres. Unfortunately, crystal spectrographs can be

hardly used above 5 nm because the period of natural crystal lattice is of the order of Å,

52

3.5. Diagnostics

i.e. 0.1 nm. The usage of grating spectrographs with the normal incidence is also limited
since it is diﬃcult to produce gratings with more than 10000 grooves per 1 mm. Never-
theless, it is possible to employ grazing incidence (the angle of incidence is close to 90◦)
to have the eﬀective groove spacing higher than 10000 grooves per 1 mm. Moreover, the

small grazing angle ensures higher reﬂectivity of a grating.

Thirdly, we must take into account that we cannot use lenses to focus spectral lines

onto the detector. The common way of focusing is the usage of a concave grating with

constant groove spacing. The disadvantage of such technique are image defects, astig-

matism in particular. Some defects can be reduced in the case of a toroidal grating with

varying groove spacing (Harada and Kita, 1980; Kita et al., 1983). In our project we

employed “classical” and cheaper way of the detection: a concave spherical reﬂection

grating in the Rowland circle grazing incidence LPS–VUV1 spectrograph.

Rowland mounting

In 1881 H. A. Rowland, professor of physics at the Johns Hopkins University, ruled the

concave grating, a device of spectacular value in modern spectroscopy. A concave re-

ﬂection grating can be considered as a concave mirror that disperses; it can be thought

to reﬂect and focus light by virtue of its concavity, and to disperse light by virtue of its

groove pattern (Palmer, 2001).

Fig. 3.17: Rowland circle spectrograph.

As regards the Rowland mounting, both the entrance slit and the focused spectrum
lie on this circle (cf. Fig. 3.17). Light of three wavelengths λ(cid:48), λ(cid:48)(cid:48), λ(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) is shown focused
at diﬀerent points on the Rowland circle. The diameter of the circle RR equals to the

53

3.5. Diagnostics

tangential radius of curvature of the grating RG which passes through the grating centre.

LPS–VUV1-3S–M spectrograph

The LPS–VUV1 grazing incidence spectrograph was constructed by the Institute of Spec-

troscopy (Laboratory of Plasma Spectroscopy, Russian Academy of Science) in cooper-

ation with Schulz Scientiﬁc Instruments and European Pulsed Power Research Associ-

ation (Schulz, 2002). It is a very adaptable proximity–focused, 1–m grazing incidence
spectrograph using an oﬀ Rowland circle registration scheme (see Fig. 3.19).

Fig. 3.18: LPS-VUV1-3S-M spectrograph.

Fig. 3.19: Registration by a plane detector.

In this registration scheme, the exact focusing takes place only for one wavelength

λ0, which corresponds to the intersection point of the detector plane with the Rowland
circle. But if the numerical aperture of the spectrograph is small6, then it is possible to
record the spectrum with suﬃcient spectral resolution in a wide spectral range λ0 ± ∆λ.
The alignment to a diﬀerent λ0 is enabled by changing the distance between the detector
plane and the grating. The two main advantages of this scheme are its easy setup and

low–cost.

6 For instance, if the plasma source is localised.

3.5. Diagnostics

The useful spectral ranges of the spectrograph 2 ÷ 14 nm, 7 ÷ 25 nm, and 25 ÷ 60 nm
were achieved with the gratings of 1200, 600, and 300 gr./mm, respectively. The 2÷14 nm

spectral range was signiﬁcant because of the presence of carbon K–shell spectral lines

and thus it was preferably used. The basic parameters of the spectrograph and gratings

are summarised in Tab. 3.9 and 3.10.

Estimation of wavelengths

We can estimate wavelengths of spectral lines from the grating equation and from the

geometry of the spectrograph.

The Rowland circle spectrograph follows the grating diﬀraction equation (Michette,

d(cos φ0 − cos φ) = mλ

(cid:114)

1 + y2
s2

(3.13)

where d is the groove spacing, φ0 is the grazing angle of incidence, φ is the grazing angle
of diﬀraction, m is the order of diﬀraction, λ is the wavelength, y is the location of an
imaged point on the entrance slit7, and s is the distance between the entrance slit and the

grating centre. In the case of y (cid:28) s we obtain the well–known equation for the plane

grating

d(cos φ0 − cos φ) = mλ

(3.14)

Fig. 3.20 shows the detection geometry of the spectrograph.

Fig. 3.20: LPS–VUV1 spectrograph geometry of detection.

The position of the spectral line λ can be derived by using the following symbols:

D − the distance between the grating centre and the detector plane

l − the distance between the grating centre and the spectral line

RR − the radius of the Rowland circle

x0 − the distance between the zeroth order and the perpendicular

from the grating centre upon the detector

7 The value of y = 0 belongs to the centre of the entrance slit.

56

3.5. Diagnostics

xλ − the distance between the spectral line λ and the perpendicular

from the grating centre upon the detector

α − the angle between the grating “plane” and the spectrograph axis

φ0 − the grazing angle of incidence
φ − the grazing angle of diﬀraction

From Fig. 3.20, the x distance between the spectral line λ and the zeroth order can be

x = x0 + xλ = D[tan(α − φ0) + tan(φ − α)]

(3.15)

By expressing the angle φ from equation (3.15) and substituting it in the grating equation

determined

(3.14), we obtain

The construction parameters such as the angles α = 10◦, φ0 = 4◦ and the groove spacing
d are ﬁxed and known with suﬃcient accuracy (Kl´ır, 2002). Thus, if the distances x

and D are known, we can easily estimate the spectral wavelength λ, or better to say

mλ. However, the zeroth order is usually out of focus and therefore it is not possible to

accurately determine the x distance (see Fig. 3.21). Also, the exact value of the distance

D can be hardly measured. For that reason we determine wavelengths with respect to two
reference lines8 for which the wavelengths are known. It is clear then, that it is essential

to surely identify several spectral lines in each spectrum.

The really certain identiﬁcation was only practicable after gaining experience with

several XUV sources, e.g. a carbon ﬁbre Z–pinch, a plasma focus (Kubeˇs et al., 2003),

a Z–pinch initiated from an aluminium wire–array (Kl´ır et al., 2004a, 2005), etc. In the

7÷24 nm region, the reliable identiﬁcation of lines was made easier when a 0.8 µm thick

aluminium ﬁlter was used. This technique was based on a sharp aluminium L–absorption
edge9 at approximately 17.1 nm, i.e. at 72.55 eV (cf. Fig. 3.14). One example of a spec-

trum when an Al ﬁlter was applied, is shown in Fig. 3.22. The most intensive spectral

line in the spectrum was near the L–absorption edge at 17.1 nm and it was identiﬁed as

8 When two wavelengths are known, we can choose x and D for which the dispersion curve Eq. 3.16

best ﬁts the experimental data.

Identiﬁcation of transitions

Once wavelengths of observed spectral lines are determined, it is possible to assign them

to transitions. For that purpose we use the following spectral databases available online:

– Kelly’s Atomic and Ionic UV/VUV Linelist (Kelly, 1987) provided by Harvard–

Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,

– Atomic Spectra Database (NIST, 2005) provided by the National Institute of Stan-

dards and Technology (NIST),

– Atomic line database for Astrophysics compiled by Verner et al. (1996) and van

Hoﬀ (2005).

58

3.5. Diagnostics

In our case, Kelly’s compilation of experimental databases is preferred but when tran-

sition probabilities are needed, the NIST database is used.

Intensity of spectral lines

Not only the wavelength but also the intensity of a spectral line is of great interest since it

enables the estimation of plasma parameters.There are six points we would like to make

in this connection.

First thing to be noted is that our spectrograph is not absolutely calibrated and we

have to get along with relative intensities.

Second, the sensitivity of our spectrograph is wavelength dependent. In two separate

paragraphs, which bring the following pages, we touch upon the spectral dependence of
grating and detector eﬃciency in particular. Figures 3.23, 3.24, 3.27, and 3.28 will show
that it is not accurate to compare spectral lines with substantially diﬀerent wavelengths.

Nevertheless, if the desired accuracy is not extremely high, we can compare spectral lines
in the region where the grating and detector eﬃciency do not change substantially.

Third, the linearity of a detector is limited, especially in the case of a UV ﬁlm

(cf. Fig. 3.26). Consequently the comparison of spectral lines with similar intensities

is highly appropriate.

The fourth fact we would like to mention is the saturation of spectral lines. In several

cases it is possible to check whether a spectral line is near saturation (either by plasma

opacity or by the saturation of a detector). Imagine, for instance, that we can ﬁnd two

spectral lines whose intensity ratio is not essentially inﬂuenced by plasma parameters and

it is almost invariable. If the measured ratio is higher in favour of the weaker line, the

stronger spectral line is most likely saturated.

The ﬁfth note is related to the width of a spectral lines. As was already said above,

the exact focusing of a spectral line takes place only for one wavelength λ0. Other lines

are defocused to various extents. Therefore, intensities cannot be estimated from the

peak value but they have to be calculated by integrating the spectral line proﬁle. In some

cases, especially when a spectral line is not intensive, the integration is doubtful since the

spectral line could not be separated from background and adjacent lines.

Finally, we make a remark about digitizing a UV ﬁlm. Our UV ﬁlms are digitised

with a scanner Epson Perfectionist 2400 Photo (4800 dpi, 16 bit grey scale) which was

calibrated by the wedge of known optical density.

Grating eﬃciency

For a reﬂection grating, relative eﬃciency is deﬁned as the energy ﬂow of monochro-
matic light diﬀracted into the order (of our interest) relative to the energy ﬂow of specu-

lar reﬂection from a polished mirror blank coated with the same material (Palmer, 2001).
The determination of grating eﬃciency in the XUV region is obviously a tricky prob-

lem because a spectrograph needs to be calibrated by a suitable XUV source such as

a synchrotron. Since such source has not been available and since the producer of our
spectrograph has not provided information about grating eﬃciency we were left with

approximate theoretical calculation. Below we present how we went about that.

For a grating with a very low blaze angle < 5◦, the eﬃciency behaviour is almost
perfectly scalar; that is, polarization eﬀects can be neglected. The diﬀraction eﬃciency
is the highest for the so–called blaze wavelength λB that is diﬀracted by the grating in
the same direction as it would be reﬂected by the groove facets. Above ﬁfty–percent
eﬃciency is obtained from roughly 0.67λB to 1.8λB (Palmer, 2001).

More detail dependence was calculated by the MATLAB programme provided by

V´aclav Nemeˇcek (Nemeˇcek, 2002). The calculation was based on the thin grating ap-

proximation (Hutley, 1982). When we used the groove spacing, grazing angle of inci-
dence, and blaze angle of our gratings, we obtained eﬃciency curves that are displayed in

Fig. 3.23. Except the grating curvature, the MATLAB programme did not include X–ray

interaction with matter. Therefore, the reﬂectivity of gold coating is discussed further.

The inﬂuence of gold coating on absolute eﬃciency in the 1 ÷ 15 nm region can be

seen in Fig. 3.24. In this ﬁgure, the reﬂectivity of a gold layer was calculated for two

grazing angles of incidence. It should be noted that the angle of incidence on the groove
facets φ0 = 4◦ is decreased by the blaze angle10. Therefore, the angle of 2◦ is relevant for
gratings no. 2, 3, whereas the angle of 3◦ is relevant for grating no. 1.

Last but not least, we would like to emphasise that experimental calibration could not

be fully replaced by theoretical calculations. The theoretical calculation was essential
only to exclude possible (unwanted) edges in grating eﬃciency. Thus the graphs in ﬁg-
ures 3.23 and 3.24 are displayed only for the illustration of how grating eﬃciencies could

vary with wavelength.

Detectors

The LPS–VUV1 spectrograph was designed for an easy operation in diﬀerent plasma

systems with options for both time–integrated detection using a ﬁlm and time–resolved

recording using active detectors, namely a microchannel plate (MCP, see Fig. 3.25) to-

gether with charge coupled device (CCD). The advantage of an ultraviolet ﬁlm is its
higher spectral resolution, whereas MCP detectors oﬀer the nanosecond exposure time

and linear response (provided detectors are not saturated). However, we should not forget

that the gain of a microchannel plate is very sensitive to applied voltage. Moreover, the

gain could vary even between two places in the same MCP section.

Fig. 3.25: Gold coated MCP detector with 4 stripes (Schulz, 2002).

As regards our experiment, gating pulses were produced by discharging 20 cm long

cables via a laser spark gap. The high–voltage power supply was provided by the Institute

of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion, Warsaw.

3.5. Diagnostics

For the time–integrated detection we applied the UF–4 ﬁlm. The problem is that this

ﬁlm is not used on a mass scale and so there is not enough information available about

its sensitivity.

Its absolute calibration was made by Shevelko (1996). Unfortunately,

the spectral variation of the sensitivity can be only guessed from the dependence of other

ﬁlms used in this spectral region. On the basis of Fig. 3.27 we can assume that the spectral

sensitivity of the UF–4 ﬁlm does not contain any signiﬁcant edges in the 2 ÷ 4 nm region

where K–shell lines of carbon ions occur.

As for as a microchannel plate is concerned, Fig. 3.28 shows typical photon detection

eﬃciency (BURLE technologies, INC., 2005).
In our calculations we considered the
eﬃciency in the 2÷7 nm region unvarying. Regarding the vignetting of our CCD camera,

its inﬂuence was not signiﬁcant.

The resolving power R of a spectrograph can be expressed as the dimensionless quantity

where δλ = λ1 − λ2 is the diﬀerence in wavelength between two adjacent monochromatic
spectral lines λ ≈ λ1 ≈ λ2 that can be separated and distinguished.
The maximum attainable resolving power for a grating is

(3.17)

(3.18)

where W is the width of the grating in the dispersion plane. Because of short wavelengths
in the XUV and X–ray region, the theoretical Rmax is extremely high. The resolving
power is then limited by other factors than a grating itself. For instance in our grating

spectrograph, among main limitations belong the dimension and location of the entrance

slit and detector elements. The geometric width of the image of the entrance slit (at the

plane of a detector) was approximately 30 µm. In the case of the UF–4 ﬁlm, this is the

limiting factor since its grain is less than 7 µm. In the case of MCP and CCD detectors,

we must take into account the convolution of the width of an entrance slit (30 µm), MCP

channel to channel distance (16 µm), ﬁbre optic channel to channel distance (8.5 µm),

and CCD pixel size (25 µm in the plane of MCP). Apart from that, the blurring of a point

source takes place also between the MCP and ﬁbre optics and between ﬁbre optics and

the CCD detector. Altogether, we measured the width of actual instrument function of

100 µm. This width then determines the experimental resolving power.

The experimentally determined resolving powers for several wavelengths and grat-

ings are shown in table 3.14. These resolving powers correspond to the focus area of

a spectrum. In the defocused part of a spectrum, the resolving power is even smaller and

is decreasing with the increasing distance of a focused line from the Rowland circle.

Spatial resolution

The common way of obtaining the spatial resolution is to give an additional slit perpen-

dicularly to the entrance slit of a grating spectrograph. Then the spectrum is dispersed

in one direction, whereas the second direction could provide the spatial information of

an emitting source. Unfortunately, this technique cannot be easily used in the case of

a spherical grating. We are thus restricted to three other possibilities:

First, the spectrum from one locality could be obtained by collimating the radiation

falling onto the entrance slit of a spectrograph. In that case, the recorded spectrum con-

tains information from one locality only, to be more precise along the line of sight.

Second, we can take use of the fact that there is only one spectral line that is exactly

focused. Other recorded spectral lines do not lie on the Rowland circle and are inherently

defocused according to the spatial extensiveness of an emitting source (see Fig. 3.19 on

page 54). One exemplary spectrum is displayed in Fig. 3.29. In that shot, the slit of the
spectrograph was oriented perpendicularly to the ﬁbre axis. The second diﬀraction order

of carbon K–shell lines was in the focused area, whereas the ﬁrst order of the Ly–α and

He–α lines was visibly defocused. In accordance with this defocusing, it was possible

to distinguish two regions radiating in carbon K–shell lines. One was located near the

anode and the other was near the cathode. This result agrees also with the gated VUV

pinhole image. The disadvantage of such procedure is that the spatial proﬁle is combined

with the spectrum and hence it cannot be applied to every case and to every spectral line.

Third, the spatial information of soft X–ray emission can be also acquired by a pin-

hole camera. When using a proper choice of ﬁlters, a pinhole camera provides both

spatial and spectral information of a radiating source. On the one hand, spectral informa-

tion of a pinhole camera is not so in–depth as a spectrograph could give, but on the other

hand, 2D spatial resolution is achieved.

In the following subsections, we describe two pinhole cameras, time–integrated X–

ray camera and time–resolved VUV camera, that were employed in our experiments.

3.5.6 X–ray pinhole camera

The time–integrated pinhole camera was used to obtain X–ray images of an emitting

plasma. Fig. 3.30 shows the cross-section of the pinhole camera construction and its

position relative to the emitting plasma.

In order to gain more information about the emitting plasma we used two pinholes
— in other words a two channel pinhole camera. These two channels were diﬀerentially
ﬁltered with a 15 µm thick Be ﬁlter and a 1.5 µm thick Al foil. The same ﬁlters were

chosen to ﬁlter our PIN diodes (see Fig. 3.14 on page 49). The X–ray images were

recorded on the Kodak Industrex CX ﬁlm.

3.5.7 Gated VUV pinhole camera

The time–resolved information about radiation from the plasma and electrodes was ob-

tained with the gated pinhole camera. Its set–up can be seen in Fig. 3.31. The temporal

resolution of the gated pinhole camera was carried out with a 4 frame MCP detector
LPS–MCP/4F–D52. The exposure time was 2 ns. The parameters of this microchannel
plate were the same as for the microchannel plate LPS–MCP/4S–D56 (see Table 3.12 on

page 63). 4 quadrants instead of 4 stripes is the only diference. To record MCP images,

the Nikon D1 digital camera was used. The spatial resolution (given by the pinhole di-

ameter, magniﬁcation, and resolution of a CCD detector) approached 200 µm. The gated

pinhole camera was mostly used without any ﬁlter for the detection of VUV radiation

(λ < 200 nm, see Fig. 3.28 on page 64). Sometimes we used an aluminium ﬁlter for the

detection of XUV emission.

3.5.8 Laser probing

The passive diagnostics described above gave some information about an electric current,

voltage and radiation in a discharge. To image the density of a plasma, we used active
probing by a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (530 nm wavelength, 3 ns pulse width11,

1 mJ energy). In most cases, the optical probing in the schlieren set–up was applied.

This technique is sensitive to the refractive index and hence to the electron density gra-

dient. The refractive index N(r, θ, z) is dependent on the electron density ne(r, θ, z) by the

equation

N(r, θ, z) =

where ω is the angular frequency of the laser beam, e is the electric charge and me is the

Variations in the electron density deﬂect the light passing through a plasma. After the

passage through a plasma, the light deviates by an angle ϑ given by

(cid:82)

The layout of the schlieren system used most recently is displayed in Fig. 3.32. The

diameters of lenses and stops determined the plasma density that was imaged. In our
experiment we used two convex lenses (diameter D = 8 cm and focal length f = 0.75 m)
and stops (diameter a = 1.0 ÷ 3.0 mm) in their focus. It means that we imaged the regions

To record the development of a plasma, the laser beam was split into two beams and one

of them was delayed by 10 ns with respect to the other. The plasma was imaged on the

charge coupled device (digital camera Nikon D100, active sensor area 23.4 × 15.6 mm,

6.0 million pixels 3000×2000) with a magniﬁcation of 0.6÷0.7. The visible light emitted

from the plasma was reduced by polarising and grey ﬁlters. The spatial resolution of the

schlieren system was less than 30 µm.

3.6 Control and Synchronising Units

In this section we would like to describe the controlling and synchronising a discharge

and diagnostics (cf. Fig. 3.33).

Fig. 3.33: Block diagram of synchronising a discharge and diagnostics.

The charging of the capacitor was controlled by the digital electronic device C–30 con-

structed by Kozl´ık (2002). When the capacitor was charged, the master pulse triggered

both the laser pumping and the thyratron. After that, 30 kV thyratron pulse triggered the

main spark gap and hence the Z–pinch discharge.

All the diagnostic tools were activated by the discharge breakdown. The signal from the

Rogowski coil triggered both oscilloscopes and the Q–switched Nd:YAG laser. After the

laser action, the laser beam triggered the spark gap that discharged high voltage cables.

The high voltage pulses from these cables then triggered both microchannel plates and

also the Pockels cell. The Pockels cell shortened the laser pulse width to 3 ns. The delay
of 10 ns between the gating of adjacent MCP quadrants/stripes was carried out by 2 m

long coaxial cables. There was also 10 ns time delay between two schlieren images. In

order to take these two schlieren photographs simultaneously with two pinhole images

and two gated XUV spectra, the laser beam pass length (from the laser output mirror

to the Z–pinch plasma) was adjusted. The time delay between the current breakdown

and recording of images was controlled by the length of a coaxial cable between the

Rogowski coil and the laser. The jitter approached the value of 5 ns.

3.7 Digital Storage Oscilloscopes

Two digital phosphor oscilloscopes Tektronix TDS3054 and TDS654C were used to store

data from the Rogowski coil, voltage monitor, PIN diodes, photomultiplier tube, and gat-

ing of microchannel plates. Both oscilloscopes have 4 channels, 500 MHz bandwidth and
5 GS/s maximum sample rate. More information can be found on the website (Tektronix,

Inc., 2005).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

During the past four years, more than 500 shots have been observed with various di-

agnostic tools. As a result, we obtained a large number of experimental data and their

interpretations. To present these results from each diagnostic tool separately would over-

burden this thesis. Instead of that, we decided to put results from various diagnostics

together so as to delineate gross dynamics of our ﬁbre Z–pinch. We shall illustrate this

dynamics on carefully chosen individual shots that most evidently show general charac-

teristics of the pinch.

To make reading easier, the chapter is divided according to diﬀerent stages that were

distinguished in the discharge, namely the breakdown, latent stage, plasma – on – ﬁbre,

ﬁbre ablation, discharge in electrode vapour and Z–pinch disintegration (see the upper

part of the graph displayed in Fig. 4.1). The time separation between neighbouring phases

was chosen somewhat arbitrary since the transition from one stage of the discharge to

another was not sharp and varied from shot to shot. All times described in this chapter
refer to the start of the current when t = 0.

Typical waveforms recorded in our Z–pinch are shown in Fig. 4.1. In this particular

shot, the Z–pinch discharge was initiated from a 15 µm diameter carbon ﬁbre with the

charging voltage of 20 kV. The interesting and characteristic features that we observed

were short pulses detected with ﬁltered PIN diodes. The short XUV and X–ray pulses

were emitted regardless of what charging voltage, material of electrodes and the diameter

of a carbon ﬁbre we tried. Therefore, in the following sections we would like to elucidate

the origin of these pulses and to describe what happens in each stage of the discharge. The

results of each stage will be also supported by a short interpretation and straightforward

discussion, whereas the overall discussion of our Z–pinch is reserved for the next chapter.

4.1. Breakdown

discharge no. 050128-1. A carbon ﬁbre of 15 µm diameter and 8 mm length, conical electrodes

4.1 Breakdown

It is well known that the breakdown phase is very much inﬂuenced and determined by

initial physical properties of a Z-pinch load. In the case of a carbon ﬁbre, the charac-

teristic initial property of the material is its high resistivity. The measured resistance of
a 10 mm long, 15 µm diameter ﬁbre was about 7 kΩ at room temperature. It is so high

resistance that a carbon ﬁbre behaves almost as an insulator and it takes some time for

the breakdown to occur. The delay between the applied voltage pulse and the start of the

current, i.e. ﬁbre breakdown, is given by the duration of avalanche ionization in strong
electric ﬁeld that is present in gases/vapours desorbed from the ﬁbre surface. The volt-

age does not collapse until a lower resistance and low density plasma is formed around

a ﬁbre. The delay between voltage and current derivative can be seen in Fig. 4.2. In the

case of a 20 kV charging voltage, we obtained the delay of 50 ± 10 ns.

75

4.1. Breakdown

Fig. 4.2: Breakdown phase in discharge no. 050128-1. A 15 µm diameter, 8 mm long carbon
ﬁbre, conical electrodes made of bronze, charging voltage of 20 kV.

However, the resistance is not the only fact that inﬂuences electrical breakdown. Sark-
isov et al. (2002) reported the signiﬁcant eﬀect of the radial electric ﬁeld and its polarity.

Because of a small ﬁbre diameter and its microroughness, the radial electric ﬁeld could
exceed the axial electric ﬁeld by a few orders of magnitude. In our case1, the polarity of

radial electric ﬁeld was positive, i.e. Er > 0. Since the electric ﬁeld increased the poten-

tial barrier for electronic emission from the ﬁbre surface, the breakdown started from the

cathode when the electric ﬁeld was the lowest. As a result, the deposited energy towards

the cathode was lower because the direct heating was prevented by a current shunted

from a ﬁbre.

It is also interesting to note that breakdowns of 15 µm diameter carbon ﬁbres were

quite reproducible, whereas we had serious problems with 5 µm tungsten wires (initial
resistance of about 25 Ω) as well as with ﬁbres from deuterated polyethylene (insulator).

The reason for that lies neither in resistivity nor in the polarity of electric ﬁeld, but most

probably in the surface properties of a carbon ﬁbre. In this connection we should perhaps

add that we saw something like a “luminescing” column around a carbon ﬁbre before the
trigger pulse was applied to a spark–gap2. We attributed this phenomenon to a gas/vapour

desorbed from the ﬁbre surface. But whatever the explanation is, this phenomenon could
eﬀectively facilitate the breakdown process and also prevent higher energy deposition

1 The part of a ﬁbre near the anode is positive and chamber walls are negative. We expect the radial

electric ﬁeld near a ﬁbre Er ≈ 108 V m−1.

2 At that moment, there was a 40 µA current ﬂowing through a ﬁbre (see the electric scheme in Fig. 3.3).

76

4.2. Latent Stage

into a ﬁbre core. We measured that the Joule heat produced before the voltage collapse

was about 20 mJ. It is much lower than the energy required for atomization of a 15 µm

carbon ﬁbre which is about 200 mJ. Moreover, the energy of 20 mJ was deposited rather

to ambient vapour than to a ﬁbre. Hence, the diameter of a carbon ﬁbre remained almost

unchanged after the breakdown.

4.2 Latent Stage

The “latent” stage of the discharge represents the time after the breakdown and before

the appearance of XUV pulses, i.e. from 0 ns to about 150 ns for 15 µm diameter ﬁbres.

Fig. 4.3: Latent phase in discharge no. 050128-1. A 15 µm diameter, 8 mm long carbon ﬁbre,
conical electrodes made of bronze, charging voltage of 20 kV.

This stage has not been explored in much detail. The main reason was the lack of
serious interest in this stage. It was supported by the fact that this phase was diﬃcult to

detect. During the ﬁrst 100 nanoseconds the plasma emitted a small amount of radiation

and the electron density was too low to be detected by the schlieren system. Besides that,

all the diagnostic tools were triggered mostly by the discharge breakdown and then we

were not able to obtain gated images before 150 ns. Our knowledge of the latent stage

came from the non–systematic investigation only. However few experimental data we

obtained, we do have certain notion about the plasma development after the breakdown.

77

4.2. Latent Stage

According to theoretical predictions3 and experimental observations (Lorenz et al.,

1998) we can assume that a low density plasma expanded to a radius of several millime-
tres. The expansion velocity was limited by the sound speed that is typically 104 m s−1.

The expansion was most likely slowed down by an increasing current. At which time this

happened depended on the current rise and the properties of a plasma column.

Further information could be inferred from Fig. 4.3, especially from the voltage and

dI/dt waveforms. It is evident that the plasma development was not so dramatic as in

the “plasma – on – ﬁbre” stage (cf. Fig. 4.1). Nevertheless, it is still possible that similar

processes might occur in both stages, only less powerful in the latent stage due to smaller

current. When we subtracted the inductive contribution, the voltage across the plasma
was less than 1 kV. For 10 kA current we obtained < 0.1 Ω resistance.

Unfortunately, ﬁrst images were recorded late in the latent stage. Fig. 4.4 shows that

at 100 ns most of the VUV radiation came from the vicinity of electrodes, especially the

anode. This observation agrees with the XUV spectrum displayed in Fig. 4.5 where the

spectral lines of oxygen, copper and zinc ions were identiﬁed. The electron temperature

estimated from Li– and Be–like ions O VI was 15 ÷ 25 eV. The temperature measurement

was done by the FLY code (see appendix B). On the one hand, the temperature was below

25 eV since the O VI spectral line at 11.6 nm (2s–4p and 2p–5d transitions) was too

weak in comparison with the spectral line at 17.3 nm (2p–3d transition). But on the other

hand, because the O VI spectral line at 17.3 nm was at least ﬁve times stronger than the

transition 2s2p–2s3d of Be–like oxygen O V, the temperature was higher than 15 eV. The

merging of spectral lines and continuum–like radiation caused that it was problematic to

separate spectral lines. In addition, we do not know what the plasma density was. That

was the reason why more accurate estimation of the temperature was not achieved.

3 The line density of a plasma (see the line density of 8 × 1017 m−1 on page 83) is of the order of the
critical density Nc = 1.3×1018A(1+ ¯z)/¯z3 (Haines et al., 1996), where A stands for the atomic mass number
and z for the ionic charge. Therefore, microinstabilities could be triggered (see page 33). Consequently, the
plasma pressure exceeds the magnetic pressure and the plasma expands. But even if the Bennett relation
holds, the current would have to follow the Haines–Hammel curve (Hammel et al., 1983) to prevent the
expansion. As our current rise time of about 1011 A s−1 is slow, a plasma column has to expand early after
the breakdown.

This phase was characterised by short XUV pulses of 10 ÷ 30 ns FWHMs6. When

the collimated PIN diode was used, the pulse width was sometimes smaller than 3 ns.

The ﬁrst XUV pulses appeared at about 150 ns. The intensity of these XUV pulses

was increasing with the growing time. Because the signal of the Be-ﬁltered PIN-diode

was very small, the energy of detected photons was mainly in the 20 ÷ 70 eV region

4 This term was derived by analogy from the expression “plasma – on – wire” which was used by Wessel
et al. (1992) to name the imploding aluminium-plasma jet onto a coaxial wire. However, the implosion
onto a metal wire diﬀers from the implosion onto a ﬁbre with a very low conductivity, and so we decided
to use the term “plasma – on – ﬁbre” instead of “plasma – on – wire”.

5 In this case, we subtracted the induction contribution of the voltage. It means U (cid:48)
P

= UP − LP ˙I =
(RP + ˙LP)I. To be more precise, we had to subtract also the induction contribution of the electrodes and
cable connected with the voltage probe.

6 Despite the fact that the shot – to – shot variation resulted in a diﬀerent number of pulses, their intensi-

ties, and widths, it was possible to identify characteristic features of our ﬁbre Z–pinch.

80

4.3. Plasma–on–Fibre

(cf. spectral responsivity of Al-ﬁltered PIN diode in Fig. 3.15 on page 50). For instance,

the energy of 20 ÷ 70 eV photons emitted during the last XUV pulse in Fig. 4.6 was about

100 mJ, whereas the energy of > 1 keV photons approached 1 mJ.

The notable feature of the radiation was the strong correlation with the voltage and

the circuit dI/dt. The gradual fall of dI/dt as well as the growth of the voltage up to 10 kV

can be clearly seen before each pulse in Fig. 4.6. These phenomena were typical for our

ﬁbre Z–pinch regardless of the diameter of ﬁbre or the shape and material of electrodes

that were used. Hence it was our primary interest to ﬁnd out how it happened that short

XUV pulses occurred.

4.3.1

Implosion

The only diagnostic tool which provided images of what happened before XUV pulses

was the gated VUV pinhole camera. For example, the behaviour before the ﬁrst XUV

pulse is displayed in Fig. 4.7. In this shot, during the gradual fall of dI/dt, VUV images
show the relatively stable7 implosion of the coronal plasma onto a ﬁbre. The implosion
velocity approached the value of 2 × 105 m s−1. The compression ratio was about 10.

Because the compression caused the increase of the plasma inductance and resistance,

we observed the drop of dI/dt.

20 ns XUV pulse. A 15 µm diameter and 7 mm long carbon ﬁbre, electrodes made of steel,

7 The implosion seemed to be stable. The development of instabilities was observed ﬁrst at the end
of the implosion, during the stagnation. This stability could be ascribed to snowplough stabilization (see
page 36). However, the skin–depth of several millimetres was comparable with the radius of the imploding
plasma. Thus a diﬀuse Z–pinch was formed and “typical” snowplough did not occur.

81

4.3. Plasma–on–Fibre

Zipper eﬀect

In most cases the implosion was non–symmetric8. As a result, the radiation was “zip-
pering” along the ﬁbre with the velocity of up to 1 × 105 m s−1. This phenomenon could

be seen in the images in Fig. 4.8. The zipper was spreading mainly from the cathode,

however, zippering from the anode was also observed.

Fig. 4.8: Zippering from the cathode with the velocity of 105 m s−1, shot no. 030321-1. A 15 µm
diameter and 8 mm long carbon ﬁbre, bisectional electrodes made of steel, charging voltage of
20 kV, schlieren sensitivity ne ≈ 5 × 1018 cm−3.

At this point we would like to point out that it was necessary to detect a low density

corona in order to recognise the implosion. Therefore, we have never seen the implo-

sion in schlieren images. As regards the pinhole camera, when an Al–foil was used to
ﬁlter radiation (Fig. 4.9), we observed only the zipper eﬀect without any evidence of the

implosion. Also, we would like to draw the attention to the fact that in this shot the radia-

tion from a ﬁbre exceeded the emission from regions near electrodes. That was observed

although an Al–ﬁlter did not permit K–shell spectral lines of carbon ions.

8 It could be the consequence of the polarity eﬀect during the breakdown. As it was mentioned above,
the direction of the radial electric ﬁeld inﬂuences the energy deposition (Sarkisov et al., 2002). According
to this model, the implosion should stagnate ﬁrst close to the cathode.

Plasma density

(cid:113)

µI2

The plasma density during the implosion could be derived from the implosion velocity
which approached 2 × 105 m s−1. This value should be of the order of the Alfv´en velocity,
0/πNiMi (see Eq. 2.43 on page 35). For the electric current I = 40 kA and
i.e. vimp ≈
for the mass of carbon ion Mi (cid:17) 2 × 10−26 kg, we obtain the line density of ions in the
coronal plasma Ni = 8 × 1017 m−1. According to Tab. 3.3, we take the density of carbon
atoms in a ﬁbre na ≈ 1.1 × 1029 m−3. Then the line density of a 15 µm diameter ﬁbre is
Na ≈ 2 × 1019 m−1. From these values we may conclude that roughly9 a few per cents of
the total mass of a ﬁbre were ablated at that time.

However, the line density of Ni = 8 × 1017 m−1 determines not only the mass of
a ﬁbre ablated but also the average plasma density. First, if we assume that the diameter

of a plasma column at the beginning of the implosion is of the order of one centimetre
(cf. Fig. 4.7), we obtain the ion density of about ni = Ni/πr2 ≈ 1016 cm−3. Second, at the
end of plasma implosion we observed the plasma diameter of the order of millimetre and
hence the ion density was about 1018 cm−3. This value corresponds to the plasma density

estimated from schlieren diagnostics (see page 87).

9 This is a rough estimation because on the one hand, atoms from electrodes were present in the coronal
plasma and therefore the number of ablated carbon ions could be lower, but on the other hand, however,
we could expect that not all the ablated carbon ions were participating in the implosion. By the way, we do
not know whether 100% of the current followed the implosion to the axis.

83

4.3. Plasma–on–Fibre

Plasma temperature

Before we present results of temperature measurement, it should be emphasised that the

plasma column was inhomogeneous in temperature. It means that the determination of

temperature depends on the choice of spectral lines which are used for calculation. In

our case, the electron temperature could be estimated from (i) Li– and Be–like oxygen

ions, (ii) Li–like carbon ions and (iii) K–shell spectral lines of carbon ions. The ﬁrst two
choices gave information mainly about colder regions10 where Li–like ions occur in an

abundance. That is why we decided to use mainly the lines of H– and He–like carbon

ions.

In most cases, K–shell lines of carbon ions were not observed at the beginning of the

implosion, i.e. before 150 ns. According to Fig. 4.10, it was a result of a low ion density

and temperature. The electron temperature was likely below 40 eV.

Fig. 4.10: Temperature dependence of intensities of selected lines calculated by the FLY code for
ni = 2 × 1017 cm−3 (dotted lines) and ni = 2 × 1018 cm−3.

The He–α line was observed ﬁrst during the implosion, but especially shortly before

the stagnation. The evolution of Ly–α and He–α lines before the stagnation is demon-

strated in Fig. 4.11. If the plasma is optically thin, the Ly–α to He–α ratio is almost

density independent and can serve as a convenient method for temperature measurement.

It can be clearly seen in Fig. 4.11 that the Ly–α to He–α ratio was increasing during

the implosion and thus the temperature was growing. This agrees with the increasing

phase of the discharge.

4.3.2 Stagnation

At the end of the implosion, a coronal plasma reached a ﬁbre and stagnated at the axis

for a brief period of time. This time corresponded to the peak of the short intensive

pulse of XUV radiation. This pulse originated predominantly from the corona around

a ﬁbre. Sometimes, however, we observed that the signal of Al–ﬁltered PIN diode did

not correspond to intensities of K–shell lines of carbon ions. This discrepancy could be

explained by the fact that Al–foil absorbs carbon K–shell lines. Hence, the intensity of
XUV pulse is determined by L–shell lines of carbon and/or by the amount of impurities.

the XUV pulse, shot no. 030219-4. A 15 µm diameter and 8 mm long carbon ﬁbre, bisectional
electrodes made of brass, 12 µF capacitors, charging voltage of 20 kV, schlieren sensitivity ne ≈
5 × 1018 cm−3.

The simultaneous diagnostics in Fig. 4.13 demonstrates that the radiation was emitted

from that part of a ﬁbre where MHD instabilities were developed. These perturbations

86

4.3. Plasma–on–Fibre

were usually axisymmetric indicating an m = 0 instability. Schlieren images corre-

sponded to pinhole images and thus the schlieren system and pinhole camera gave similar

value of perturbation wavelengths λ. In the case of 15 µm carbon ﬁbres, the wavelength λ

and pinch radius (or to be more precise, the diameter of instabilities) R varied from 0.3 to
1 mm and 0.5 to 1.5 mm, respectively. The kR product, where k = 2π/λ is the axial wave
number, was 2 ÷ 10 and seemed to increase with the time. However, accurate evaluation

was impossible since only a few lobes developed along the ﬁbre. Moreover, the changing

wavelength λ showed the presence of a mixture of instabilities (see the schlieren image

in Fig. 4.8).

Plasma parameters

The graph in Fig. 4.13 shows the experimental and simulated spectrum. The simulated

spectrum was calculated by the collisional–radiative code FLY. As far as the input pa-

rameters for the steady–state simulation are concerned, the electron temperature Te and
density ne were 80 eV and 1019 cm−3, respectively. Optical depth eﬀects were taken into
account. The estimation of the electron density ne was ambiguous owing to its depen-

dence on the choice of the optical path length.

Therefore, plasma density was obtained from schlieren images assuming a parabolic

density proﬁle. The highest sensitivity of our schlieren system determined the minimum
electron density of 5 × 1018 cm−3 (see page 70). When we used a larger stop in the
schlieren system we observed plasmas with electron densities above 1019 cm−3. On the

basis of our measurements, we assumed that the average electron density during the
stagnation was of the order of ne ≈ 1019 cm−3. For the average ion charge of 5, we get the
ion density of ni ≈ 2 × 1018 cm−3 which is two times higher than the density estimated
from the implosion velocity (see page 83). It is a reasonable agreement especially if we

consider that both methods give only a rough estimation and that the density during the

stagnation could be increased by the particles ablated from a ﬁbre.

Bennett equilibrium

Assuming the steady–state equilibrium of a Z–pinch during the stagnation, it is possible

to compare our experimental results with the Bennett equilibrium.

During the stagnation the current I ﬂowing through the pinch was about 40 kA, the

temperature T was about 70 eV. The ionization state was primarily H–like and He–like

carbon thus the ion charge z was about 5.5. Then the Bennett equation 2.15 on page 28

87

4.3. Plasma–on–Fibre

gives the ion line density Ni = 1018 m−1. This value is of the order of the density deter-
mined from the implosion velocity (see page 83).

4.3.3 Expansion

The stagnation lasted from a several nanoseconds to a few tens of nanoseconds. After

the stagnation we observed the expansion of a plasma column. The rapid expansion was

inferred from the schlieren images. For instance in Fig. 4.14, the density of a plasma

column was below the sensitivity of the schlieren system already 20 ns after the peak of

XUV radiation. To determine the expansion velocity was somewhat problematic because

of the drop of plasma density and emitted power. However, it was clear that the expansion

velocity was high enough to cause the rapid increase of dI/dt. The expansion was ac-

companied by the gradual cooling. In Fig. 4.14, the Ly–α to He–α ratio fell down during

10 ns. According to Fig. 4.12, the temperature dropped from 60 eV to less than 45 eV.

long carbon ﬁbre, conical electrodes made of bronze, 3 µF capacitor, 20 kV charging voltage,

88

4.3. Plasma–on–Fibre

During or after the expansion, we sometimes observed cold and dense plasma regions.

For example, Fig. 4.15(a) shows the expanded dense core of a ﬁbre 10 ns after the series

of short XUV pulses.

(a) Expanded dense core at 275 ns, it occurred 10 ns
after the peak of 10 ns pulse in discharge no. 030409-4.

Fig. 4.15: A 15 µm diameter and 8 mm long carbon ﬁbre, bisectional electrodes made of steel,
3 µF capacitor, 25 kV charging voltage, schlieren sensitivity ne ≈ 5 × 1018 cm−3.

Once or twice we also observed the helix after the expansion. Fig. 4.15(b) was

recorded 50 ns after the XUV pulse. At this time the plasma was expanded to a ra-

dius of several millimetres, whereas the diameter of helix was about 50 µm. This begs

the question of what kept this cold structure in existence.

4.3.4 Multiple pulses

Fig. 4.6 shows a high number of pulses that were detected by a PIN diode. The intensity

of pulses was increasing with the growing time most likely because of the rising current.

It was necessary to decide whether pulses originated from various places along a ﬁbre or
from the whole length of a ﬁbre at diﬀerent moments.

We believe that both phenomena might occur. During the rise of the current it was

possible that the multiple implosion of the corona onto a ﬁbre took place. However,

when there were more than two pulses, they did not originate from the whole length

of a ﬁbre. Especially in the case of conical electrodes, the non–symmetric implosion

occurred separately at the anode, at the cathode, and at the centre (cf. Fig. 4.14). As

a result, we observed higher number of pulses than in the case of ﬂat electrodes.

4.3.5 Experimental data interpretation

Gradual fall of current derivative and rise of voltage

First observation which needs to be interpreted is the gradual fall of circuit dI/dt and the

rise of voltage before each XUV pulse (see Fig. 4.6).

The starting point of our explanation is Fig. 3.6 on page 40. According to it we can

express

where C0, L0, R0 are parameters of a short circuit and LP, RP stand for the inductance

and resistance of a pinch plasma, respectively. On the one hand, the inductance of

the pinching plasma (LP < 10 nH) was lower than the inductance of the rest of circuit
(L0 ≈ 100 nH) and, in addition to that, the inductance depends on the pinch radius only
logarithmically. Therefore, it did not aﬀect the current derivative to an excessive degree.
On the other hand, because of a low resistance of the current generator (R0 = 25 m Ω),
the current waveform was very sensitive to the plasma resistance RP(t) and to the change
of inductance ˙LP(t). That is why the observed fall of dI/dt can be attributed to the rise of
the impedance (RP + ˙LP) during the implosion and stagnation. The increase of (RP + ˙LP)
also caused the voltage growth since

In order to obtain quantitative results, we simulated the R–L–C circuit with a time–
dependent RP + ˙LP term (see appendix D). An example of our simulation is shown in
Fig. 4.16 where the experimentally observed waveforms are presented together with

MATLAB simulation. Fig. 4.16 shows that the observed waveforms in the period be-
tween 250 ns and 300 ns could be explained by the rise of the RP + ˙LP term up to 0.25 Ω
and by its subsequent drop to -0.05 Ω. An inevitable question is what part of this value

could be attributed to the resistance RP and what part belongs to the change of the induc-
tance ˙LP?

Resistance versus time–varying inductance

To solve this question we present the following calculation assuming the current ﬂowing
through a cylindrically symmetric Z–pinch11.

We can express RP and LP as

where l, R, σ stand for the length, radius, and conductivity of a plasma column, respec-

tively. The quantity b represents the radius of the experimental chamber.

This led us to conclusion that during the implosion the energy was coupled from the

generator through a time–varying inductance. The electrical energy was mainly con-

verted (i) into the radial motion of ions, (ii) into the (adiabatic) compression of a plasma
column and (iii) into the increase of magnetic energy12. Shock heating of ions might also

occur, however, we have not observed any shock–wave during the implosion of a coronal

plasma onto a ﬁbre.

Late in the implosion, as the radius R and velocity vimp were decreasing, the inﬂuence

of plasma resistance was growing and the resistive heating started to play an important
role. Speaking quantitatively, for values in Eq. 4.8 and for l = 3 mm (a part of a ﬁbre

participating in the implosion when conical electrodes were used), we obtain a time-

˙LP = 0.03 Ω

Such value is also lower than 0.25 Ω. In order to reach 0.25 Ω, we can naturally reduce

4.3. Plasma–on–Fibre

Plasma instabilities

The substantial contribution to plasma column resistance during the stagnation could be

ascribed to instabilities. The strong argument for that are voltage spikes which corre-

sponded to XUV pulses. At the same time, these XUV pulses did not originate from the

whole length of a ﬁbre but from several bright spots. These bright spots corresponded to
the interaction of the necks of an m = 0 instability with the dense core (cf. Fig. 4.17).

Fig. 4.17: Observed m = 0 instability in shot no. 040421-1. Oﬀ–axis bright spots originated from
the later stage of a discharge. A 15 µm diameter and 8 mm long carbon ﬁbre, conical electrodes

(4.14)

we obtain the plasma resistance

RP (cid:17) 0.1 Ω

If we consider both the wide plasma column and several necks of m = 0 instability, the
total plasma resistance during the stagnation could achieve 0.25 Ω.

However, these values represent only rough estimations since the radius of a plasma

channel was limited by the spatial resolution of the order of 100 µm. Moreover, we do

not know where exactly the current was ﬂowing and what was the role of anomalous

resistivity within instabilities.

We must not also forget that instabilities contribute not only to plasma resistance but
also to the ˙LP term. An m = 0 instability develops with the Alfv´en velocity of 105 m s−1
and thus according to values in Eq. 4.13

The power 1

As regards an m = 1 instability, its contribution to the ˙LP term depends on the rate of
how fast it develops. We often observed helical structures in pinhole images, whereas in

schlieren images they were less apparent. Similar results were observed by Lorenz et al.

(1998). The complex helical structures develop usually during an expansion phase after

stagnation (cf. Fig. 4.15(b) and Spielman et al., 1994; Spielman and de Groot, 2001).
Recently, the inﬂuence of an m = 1 instability upon Z–pinch dynamics has been quanti-
tatively discussed by Chittenden et al. (2004). He found that the plasma is going m = 1

unstable when the Lorentz force starts to compress the stagnated plasma. Then the onset
of an m = 1 instability provides an eﬃcient mechanism for dissipation of the magnetic

energy surrounding the stagnated pinch. Not only does the formation of a helix allow the

magnetic ﬁeld to do work in driving an expansion but it also enhances the ohmic heating
by elongating the current path length13.

On the basis of preceding paragraphs we can conclude that it is not easy to unam-
biguously determine what contributed to the RP + ˙LP term. Nevertheless, we can say that
a time–varying inductance was important during the implosion, whereas at the stagnation

the inﬂuence of plasma instabilities and resistive heating seemed to be the dominant one.

Energetics during plasma - on - ﬁbre stage

The previous paragraphs clariﬁed rises of voltage. During these spikes, the energy from

the current generator was fed into a plasma. The excess of energy was almost immedi-

ately (within 5 ns) radiated and this is why we observed XUV pulses. Since we measured

the current and voltage, it was possible to estimate the energetics of our Z–pinch. We

could calculate the ohmic heating and the kinetic energy delivered to ions in the period

13 The energy conservation in wire–array Z–pinches has become a debated issue because radiated ener-
gies could be more than 3÷4 times greater than the ion kinetic energy from the implosion. Already 20 years
ago, however, Riordan et al. (1981) pointed out that the observed radiation yield was signiﬁcantly higher
than the kinetic energy input. Besides anomalous resistivity in the trailing mass (Peterson et al., 1998), the
obvious extra energy source available is the magnetic energy that is much greater than the kinetic energy
of implosion. The magnetic energy could be dissipated by instabilities through the ˙LP term. Rudakov and
Sudan (1997); Rudakov et al. (2000) and Velikovich et al. (2000) proposed the model of current reconnec-
tions around an m = 0 instability and subsequent collapse of toroidal magnetic ﬂux tubes. Haines et al.
(2004) considered ﬁne-scale instabilities and viscous heating of ions to play the major role. Nevertheless,
a lot of plasma physicists see m = 1 behaviour in the current ﬂow to be the most likely explanation of
a “paradox” heating in question (cf. Kubeˇs et al., 2002; Chittenden et al., 2004).

The overall energy deposited to the plasma during one XUV pulse was thus about 5 J.
This energy was used for ablating of a central ﬁbre, ionization14 and heating of a plasma.
Another part of the input energy was spent by advection, thermal diﬀusion of a plasma,

plasma expansion, etc. The radiated energy (100 mJ in the XUV region, see page 81)

represented only a small fraction of the overall deposited energy.

Expansion velocity

Another value that can be evaluated from Fig. 4.16 is the expansion velocity. Because
the RP + ˙LP term fell to -0.05 Ω, the change of inductance was higher than 0.05 Ω. From
Eq. 4.6 and for l = 3 mm, R = 500 µm (cf. Fig. 4.14), we obtain the expansion velocity
vexp above 4 × 104 m s−1.

14 The energy of 4.5 J is needed for the whole ﬁbre ionised to the He–like stage, whereas 30 J are

necessary for the ionization to bare nuclei.

4.4. Fibre Ablation

4.4 Fibre Ablation

Approximately 500 ns after the breakdown, gaps in the ﬁbre indicated that several parts

of a ﬁbre had been already ablated, especially the part near the anode. In Fig. 4.18, one
can see the m = 0 behaviour which most likely increased the ablation rate. In the case

of conical electrodes, the central part of a ﬁbre persisted up to 700 ns and then formed

a dense and cold plasma “island”. The entire length of a ﬁbre was seen totally ablated

750 ns after the current breakdown. After that, the radiation was still detected with the

Al– and Be–ﬁltered PIN diodes.

In this phase, emitted pulses with various FWHMs were accompanied with rises of
voltage15 up to 30 kV (similarly to the plasma – on – ﬁbre phase). However, in compari-

son with the ﬁrst 500 ns of the discharge, these pulses were more energetic. The energy

of > 1 keV photons exceeded 10 mJ in one pulse and the abundance of > 6 keV pho-
tons was detected behind a 100 µm thick Al ﬁlter16. This fact brought us naturally to the

question of what led to the emission of X–ray pulses. It was evident that the important

role was played by the material of electrodes. The following subsections shall add to the

15 We expect that the electrode vapour spread over a signiﬁcant part of the chamber. This could reduce
the current ﬂowing through the Rogowski coil and consequently stop the sensitive detection of fast changes
of a plasma impedance. As a result, the coincidence between an X–ray pulse and a dip in dI/dt disappeared
after 400 ns.

16 We detected radiation ﬁltered also with a 750 µm thick Al foil. Thus the energy of several photons

was higher than 10 keV (see Fig. 3.16).

97

4.5. Discharge in Electrode Vapour

explanation of that.

4.5.1 Evaporation of material from electrodes

The emission from the electrodes as well as the expansion of the electrode vapour were

apparent early in the discharge (see Fig. 4.4 and 4.21). With the growing time the in-

ﬂuence of material from electrodes was increasing. The observed velocity of evaporated
materials from electrodes approached 104 m s−1, therefore the discharge occurred more

or less in the vapour of electrodes later than 400 ns after the current breakdown. This

expectation was proven experimentally when we observed that spectral lines of copper

and tin ions started to dominate in XUV spectra after 500 ns (cf. Fig. 4.22). By the way,

the peak of tin ions at 13.5 nm has become important for EUV lithography.

4.5.2 Magnetic pinching of evaporated material

Fig. 4.22 displays the oﬀ-axis implosion of electrode material near the anode. The im-
plosion velocity was about 3 × 104 m s−1. At about 560 ns, i.e. at the time when we

could expect the end of the implosion, an X–ray pulse was generated. Schlieren images

indicated that more mass participated in the implosion. The electron line density above
1020 m−1 was two orders of magnitude higher than in the plasma – on – ﬁbre phase.

ter and 9 mm long carbon ﬁbre, conical electrodes made of bronze, 20 kV charging voltage.

4.5.3 Development of plasma instabilities

The ﬁnal stage of the implosion was detected in shot no. 040414-2 (see Fig. 4.23). In this

particular shot, images were obtained just before and during the X–ray pulse of a 2 ns rise
time. The schlieren and pinhole images caught the development of the m = 0 instability

with three “blobs”. Furthermore, the most intensive radiation (as could be seen in the
time–integrated pinhole images) came from one oﬀ–axis elongated bright spot which
corresponded to the constriction of one m = 0 neck. These bright spots occurred mainly

near the anode and their number was shot – to – shot dependent.

At this point we shall turn to the plasma – on – ﬁbre stage. In Fig. 4.23, the entire

length of a carbon ﬁbre is displayed in the time–integrated Al–ﬁltered pinhole image.

The radiation from a ﬁbre was absorbed by the Be-ﬁlter. Such result agrees with the

observation of XUV pulses (and no X–ray pulses) during the plasma – on – ﬁbre phase.

Next, the spatially non–uniform exposure along the ﬁbre gave another evidence that the
radiation came from that part of a ﬁbre where an m = 0 instability developed (cf. page 93).

Temperature of bright spots

The plasma parameters within bright spots has not been explored in detail. The density

of the bright spot displayed in Fig. 4.23 can be only guessed. As far as the temperature is

concerned, the X–ray pinhole camera and photomultiplier signal evidently demonstrated

that more energetic photons were emitted whenever bright spots were observed. Never-

theless, these photons could be produced by “non–Maxwellian” electrons accelerated in
high electric ﬁeld17, whereas the plasma temperature could be low. The only thing which

can be used is the temperature estimated from an XUV spectrum.

Fig. 4.24 presents the time–integrated spectrum in the 2 – 15 nm region. In this spec-

trum, the ﬁrst order of carbon K–shell lines did not lie on the Rowland circle and therefore

the Ly–α and He–α lines of carbon ions were defocused. This large defocusing indicates

that these K–shell lines originated from an extensive source. To be more speciﬁc, al-

17 The plasma voltage was up to 30 kV. The peak voltage could exceed the charging voltage of 20 kV
because the large inductance of the driver L0 kept current ﬂowing through a plasma when the plasma
resistance rapidly increased.

100

4.5. Discharge in Electrode Vapour

though the spectral lines in question were emitted from the entire length of a ﬁbre, it is

particularly true for the region near the anode. Contrary to these spectral lines, the line at

about 4.7 nm was relatively narrow and therefore it must have originated from a smaller
region. This spectral line was identiﬁed as the transition 3d 2D – 4f 2F of a Na–like

copper ion Cu IXX at 4.74 nm. It means that the Na–like stage of copper occurred in
a plasma and thus18 the temperature was well above 100 eV. The peak temperature could

be of course even higher.

and 9 mm length, conical electrodes made of brass, 20 kV charging voltage.

4.5.4 Experimental data interpretation

Now, we shall discuss occurrence of X–ray pulses accompanied with rises of voltage. It

could be done similarly to the interpretation of the plasma – on – ﬁbre stage.

The peak current at this phase was about 80 kA, therefore the increase of voltage
above 20 kV leads to the RP + ˙LP term of about 0.3 Ω. We believe that such value
was achieved within plasma instabilities that were also presumably sources of energetic

photons. These X–ray photons were generated for several reasons. Firstly, instabilities
could develop substantially because the ﬁbre had been already ablated19. Secondly, the

current at this phase was higher than in the plasma – on – ﬁbre stage. Thirdly, the plasma

contained ions with higher atomic number Z than carbon has. As a result, not only

continuum emission but also line radiation occurred in the X–ray region.

18 According to Eq. A.29 on page 147 the temperature was estimated from Cu XVIII ionization energy

of about 650 eV (Attwood, 1999).

19 This was also the reason for oﬀ-axis implosion.

101

4.6. Z–pinch Disintegration

4.6 Z–pinch Disintegration

The disintegration of the Z–pinch occurred at about 1 µs. At that time, discharge cham-

ber walls were most likely reached by ejecta of a plasma. Also, X–ray and UV ﬂux

emitted from a Z–pinch could envelop the surface of the insulator with a plasma. Due to

that, the signiﬁcant part of the current was ﬂowing outside the “Z–pinch region” and the

decreasing amount of radiation was detected (see Fig. 4.25).

4.7 Energetics of Z–pinch

The previous sections have described individual phases of our Z–pinch, from the break-

down to its disintegration. In this section we shall deal with the overall energetics of

our ﬁbre Z–pinch. After that we will discuss the inﬂuence of the electrodes and ﬁnally
we will conclude this chapter by saying a few words about diﬀerences between ﬁbres of

various diameters.

The measurement of plasma voltage and current enabled us to estimate the energy
deposited into our Z–pinch. The deposited energy was spent on the ablation/evaporation
of a ﬁbre/electrodes, ionization and heating of a plasma, thermal diﬀusion, advection,

etc. Only a small part of the deposited energy was radiated from the plasma. The overall

energetics of our ﬁbre Z–pinch is summarised in Tab. 4.1.

The total emitted energy was estimated from the PIN diode used with a 200 µm

pinhole, which was this time used instead of a ﬁlter (see the blue line in Fig. 3.15). The

results from shot no. 050512-1 are presented in Fig. 4.25.

102

4.7. Energetics of Z–pinch

It shows that most of the energy was radiated in less energetic photons during the

long–lasting emission. This emission was increasing with the rising current and was not

so sensitive to the fast changes in Z–pinch dynamics as XUV pulses were. Surprisingly,

this long–lasting emission overlapped XUV and X–ray pulses which one could expect to

be more apparent.

As regards places of the long–lasting emission origin20, they are displayed in the

Fig. 4.26. Clearly, low energy photons were emitted mainly from regions near electrodes,

whereas XUV photons originated from a ﬁbre.

4.8. Inﬂuence of Electrodes

Inﬂuence of Electrodes

Describing our ﬁbre Z–pinch, it is impossible to leave out the inﬂuence of electrodes

on the plasma dynamics. For instance, Fig. 4.27 shows PIN diode signals for various

electrodes. One can see how the number, intensities, and widths of XUV pulses changed

with the choice of electrodes. In this section we present the inﬂuence of material and

shape of electrodes.

Fig. 4.27: Al ﬁltered PIN diode signals for diﬀerent materials and shapes of electrodes.

As far as the choice of the electrode material is concerned, it inﬂuenced mainly emis-
sion spectra. The diﬀerence between two XUV spectra in the case of brass and stainless

steel electrodes is shown in Fig. 4.28. In the 10–24 nm spectral region the spectral lines

of Li-and Be-like oxygen ions were dominant. The intensities of O VI lines corresponded

to the Boltzmann distribution of excited states. The appropriate “integral” electron tem-

perature was 15 eV (cf. Fig. 4.28 and Eq. A.30 on page 148). The lines of H- and He-like

carbon ions were also present. Some of the lines corresponded to higher–Z ions. In the

case of brass electrodes, the characteristic feature was continuum-like radiation between

12 and 18 nm. After replacing brass electrodes by stainless steel ones, the continuum in

question disappeared. Hence, the material of electrodes determined (i) the spectral region

where the emission occurred and consequently (ii) intensities and widths of XUV pulses.

We did not, however, observed any signiﬁcant change of gross Z–pinch dynamics with

the choice of electrode material. It was rather the shape of electrodes what seemed to
aﬀect deeply the discharge.

The shape of electrodes determined not only intensities, widths and number of XUV
pulses but it also inﬂuenced the zipper eﬀect, ﬁbre ablation, X–ray emission, etc. We

found out, for example, that a ﬁbre was not fully ablated and there were no X–ray pulses

observed in the case of “bisectional” electrodes. The reason for that could be the non–

symmetry of the electrodes that caused the early deﬂection of a coronal plasma from

a ﬁbre to chamber walls (cf. Fig. 4.29).

In the case of conical electrodes, a ﬁbre was ablated and X–ray pulses were observed.

Nevertheless, as it has been mentioned above, the non–symmetric implosion occurred

separately at the anode, at the cathode, and at the centre, and thus a higher number of

pulses was observed.

4.9 Various Fibre Diameters

Most of our results presented above came from experiments that were carried out with
carbon ﬁbres of a 15 µm diameter. Similar results21 were observed also with 6 µm and 80
µm diameter ﬁbres. As regards diﬀerences between ﬁbres, the discharge with a 6 µm di-

ameter ﬁbre was quite irreproducible, K–shell emission of carbon ions was less intensive

and the inﬂuence of electrode material seemed to be more apparent than with a 15 µm

diameter ﬁbre. In the case of a 80 µm diameter ﬁbre, XUV pulses lasted longer and the
ﬁbre was probably not fully ablated. However, the comparison between diﬀerent ﬁbre di-

ameters was dependent on the shape of electrodes. In addition, shot – to – shot variation

prevented us from detail quantitative comparison. The discussion of this shot – to – shot

variation goes beyond the scope of our experiment because we were mainly focused on

the basic description of Z–pinch dynamics and it was not our ambition at that time to

study and, by extension, to increase the discharge reproducibility.

21 As examples, we could mention the occurrence of XUV pulses, dips in dI/dt, and plasma – on – ﬁbre.

Chapter 5

DISCUSSION

In this chapter we compare our results with other Z–pinch experiments. First, we shall

summarise the most important results of other ﬁbre experiments. Then, we will point out
results which are similar or diﬀerent to ours. The particularity of our ﬁbre Z–pinch is the

implosion of a coronal plasma onto a ﬁbre and thus it will be treated of in more detail.

Finally, we will deal with the most energetic phase of our discharge which occurred in

electrode vapour.

5.1 Fibre Z–pinch Experiments

Fibre Z–pinch experiments were carried out on modern high–voltage pulsed–power gen-

erators at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Naval Research Laboratory, Imperial College

in London, Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, and Kurchatov Institute in Moscow (see

section 1.3 and appendix C). Even though each experimental group observed somewhat
diﬀerent behaviour of a ﬁbre Z–pinch, the gross dynamics of a ﬁbre pinch was described.

We shall sum up the most important ﬁndings of these research groups in the following

text.

We start with the global expansion of a coronal plasma surrounding the solid core.

The expansion was observed although the Pease–Braginskii current was reached and the

current rise was fast enough to cause the radiative collapse. This rapid expansion could

happen for several reasons and we touch upon them brieﬂy. One of the reasons might

be anomalous resistivity in a low density coronal plasma which, if it occurs, causes the

plasma kinetic pressure to exceed the magnetic pressure (Chittenden, 1995). As a re-

sult, the Bennett equilibrium does not hold and the pinch expands. Another reason for
the expansion may lie in MHD instabilities. During the development of an m = 0 in-

stability, the bulges of the instability expand and the constricted regions cause enhanced

107

5. Discussion

non-uniform heating of the core (Sheehey et al., 1992; Riley et al., 1996). An m = 0 in-

stability was apparent very early in the discharge in shadowgrams and schlieren images.

These instabilities exhibited highly dynamic behaviour (Chittenden et al., 1997), but they

were not disruptive (most likely because of the dense core which lasted for a relative

long time). During the interaction of the coronal plasma with the remaining dense core,

bright spots occurred. After the dynamic bright–spot phase, the disruption accompanied

with the neutron production and X–ray emission was observed as soon as the ﬁbre was

completely ablated.

All these results, but mainly the rapid expansion and the early development of plasma
instabilities, eﬀectively decrease the plasma density and eliminate the possibility of using

a ﬁbre Z–pinch as a fusion reactor.

5.2 Implosion of Coronal Plasma onto Central Fibre

Our work with a carbon ﬁbre Z–pinch brought some results that were to a certain ex-

tent similar to those of above mentioned experiments despite the fact that peak currents
and rise times were substantially diﬀerent. Similarly to these experiments, we made the

following observations:

– A low density coronal plasma carried almost all the current, a cold dense core

persisted for a long time. The interaction of a coronal plasma with this dense core

then substantially inﬂuenced the plasma dynamics.

– The XUV emission came mainly from bright spots which were produced by insta-

bilities that developed in a low density corona. However, these instabilities were

not disruptive as long as the dense core survived unionised.

– After the ﬁbre ablation, the intense X–ray radiation was produced.

Nevertheless, our Z–pinch diﬀered in several issues of a great importance too. Fibre

Z–pinches driven by fast pulsed power generators are usually considered to be in pres-

sure balance because the current rises rapidly and the plasma pressure could be balanced

against the magnetic forces in every moment. Contrary to that, our ﬁbre Z–pinch driven

by microsecond capacitive discharge expanded ﬁrst to the diameter of about one cen-

timetre. When the current built up, the implosion of a coronal plasma onto a central ﬁbre

occurred. This means that our ﬁbre Z–pinch behaved as a dynamic pinch for a lapse of

108

5. Discussion

time. Even though the current was about 40 kA, the implosion velocity approached the
value of 2 × 105 m s−1 which implies the kinetic energy of carbon ions of about 2.5 keV.

It is true that noticeable implosion could be observed also on pulsed power generators,
however, the current prepulse1 must be applied. Such experiment was carried out on
a pulsed power generator IMP (Imax = 200 kA, t10%−90% = 60 ns, Imperial College,
London, Lorenz et al., 1998). In this experiment, the prepulse delivered 10 kA current

with a 50 ns quarter period into a 7 µm diameter carbon ﬁbre. The breakdown of the ﬁbre

occurred when the voltage reached about 20 kV. The prepulse generated a low density
coronal plasma of Ni = 3 × 1017 m−1 (cf. with our value of 8 × 1017 m−1, page 83)
which expanded to a radius of the order of a millimetre. After the switch of the main

discharge current, they observed, similarly as we did, implosion of a low density plasma
onto a ﬁbre2, the zipper from the cathode towards the anode, the soft X–ray pulse, and

subsequent rapid expansion.

Another similar feature between Lorenz’s and our experiment was the observation
of m = 0 and m = 1 instabilities during the stagnation of the corona at the ﬁbre. For
Alfv´en velocity of 2 × 105 ms−1, the pinch diameter of about 1 mm, and the conductivity
of 105 S m−1, the ideal MHD model predicts the characteristic time of instability growth
τ = R/vA = 2.5 ns. Despite a low Lundquist number S = µσvAR ≈ 10, enhanced stability
was not conﬁrmed and the presence of a ﬁbre did not seem to signiﬁcantly suppress MHD

instabilities. However, these were not excessively disruptive.

The development of instabilities caused the generation of XUV pulses from several

bright spots. Because of a low current and, by extension, a relative high resistivity, the
main heating mechanism was most likely Joule heating. Nevertheless, the ˙LP term cannot
be ruled out. In that case, plasma instabilities could provide an eﬀective mechanism for

dissipating the magnetic energy adjacent to the pinch.

The coronal plasma in our experiment and in the experiment of Lorenz et al. (1998)

was formed from a ﬁbre. Another possibility would be to create a plasma from a wire–
array or gas–puﬀ which subsequently implodes onto a central ﬁbre. We shall look at these
two approaches in the following sections. As regards the diﬀerence between the coronal
plasma created from a ﬁbre and the plasma formed from a wire–array or gas–puﬀ, the

1 Recently, a current prepulse applied before the main pulse has been suggested to evaporate a wire and
to allow it to expand. The reason for that is to create a homogenous plasma for subsequent implosion (Choi
and Zakharov, 2005).

2 In Lorenz’s experiment, the faster current rise–time implied lower skin depth and thus the snowplough

implosion occurred.

109

5. Discussion

higher mass was imploded onto a ﬁbre in experiments with wire–arrays or gas–puﬀs.

Clearly, the energetics of these Z–pinches is dominated by the implosion energy.

In

our ﬁbre experiment, the implosion energy was relatively low. Much more important

phenomena was probably the transfer of the current in the vicinity of a ﬁbre when the

corona imploded.

5.3 Wire–Array and Gas–Puﬀ Implosion onto Central Fibre

The implosion of a wire-array Z–pinch onto a deuterated ﬁbre was studied on the S–

300 device (4 MA, 700 kV and 100 ns; RRC Kurchatov Institute, Moscow). These

experiments were performed at a peak current of about 2 MA with a rise time of about

100 ns (Kl´ır et al., 2004a, 2005). An aluminium wire–array of 1 cm in diameter was used

as a load. Each wire–array consisted of 30 ÷ 60 aluminium wires of 15 µm in diameter

and 1 cm in length. The deuterated polyethylene (CD2)n ﬁbres with diameters between
80 and 120 µm were placed on the axis of the array. The purpose of these experiments on

the S–300 generator was to study the generation of XUV and X–ray radiation together

with the neutron production. It was found out that the implosion of a wire–array had the

positive inﬂuence on the neutron yield. The neutron yield was one order in magnitude

higher in the case of an imploding wire–array onto a ﬁbre than without a wire–array

(cf. Kl´ır et al., 2004a, 2005 and appendix C).

Two shots with 240 aluminium wires imploding onto a (CD2)n ﬁbre were also carried
out on Z–machine in 1998. However, more neutrons of (2.8 ± 0.2) × 1012 were generated
on Saturn during the implosion of a hollow deuterium gas–puﬀ3 onto a 250 µm deuterated

polyethylene ﬁbre located on the pinch axis (Spielman et al., 1991). Recently, the highest
neutron yield from the D-D reaction of 6 × 1013 has been achieved with double–shell
deuterium gas–puﬀ, i.e. without any ﬁbre (Velikovich et al., 2005).

On the basis of our results and observations of other research groups, we believe
that the implosion onto a ﬁbre oﬀers the possibility of current transfer near the ﬁbre.

However, when one considers higher neutron yield, solid ﬁbres are probably less suitable
than deuterium gas–puﬀs.

3 This conﬁguration was very similar to the deuterium plasma–sheath imploding onto a (CD2)n ﬁbre on

the PF–1000 plasma focus (Kubeˇs et al., 2004).

110

5.4 Plasma – on – Wire

5. Discussion

The peculiarity of a solid ﬁbre is its initial non–conductivity that causes the transfer of
the current from a ﬁbre and thus makes the energy coupling into a ﬁbre diﬃcult. Diﬀerent

situation occurs when a conducting wire is used instead of a ﬁbre. The implosion of an

aluminium jet onto a coaxial aluminium wire was ﬁrst studied by Wessel et al. (1992).

They found the resultant plasma to be more uniform and hotter than a wire–only and

jet–only pinch. The pinch also demonstrated that an imploding plasma could couple the

energy from a current generator to a micron–sized wire.

Our experiments on the PF–1000 plasma focus in Warsaw showed similar behaviour.

In some shots with deuterium ﬁlling, we placed an Al wire at the axis and top of the anode

having no galvanic connection to the anode. Fig. 5.1 shows the spatially resolved spec-

trum recorded with the time–integrated X–ray spectrograph, which detected resonance,

intercombination and satellite lines of He–like aluminium ions. Clearly, the whole length

of an Al wire did not manifest typical large–scale instabilities which are characteristic

for wire Z–pinches. If we realise that the length of a wire was 8 cm, it was quite an im-

pressive result for a pinch plasma, which may lead to reconsideration of a wire Z–pinch

as an X–ray laser medium.

5. Discussion

Having dealt with the plasma – on – ﬁbre phase of our discharge, we shall now turn to

the phase in which electrode vapour determined plasma dynamics.

5.5 Discharge in Electrode Vapour and Bright Spots

The inﬂuence of electrode vapour on Z–pinch dynamics was visibly increasing with the

growing time. The dominant role of the material evaporated from the electrodes was

apparent after the ﬁbre ablation. After that we observed bright spots and hard X–ray

emission together with sharp voltage spikes and dips in dI/dt. As far as the gradual rise of

plasma voltage is concerned, it could be explained by the implosion of a plasma column.

However, the implosion could not cause the observed sharp increase of voltage which

was related to the development of plasma instabilities near the maximum compression.

Much alike results were also obtained in plasma foci, vacuum sparks and higher–Z
gas–puﬀs driven by low impedance generators. This phase of the discharge produces

the most energetic electrons, ions, and photons, therefore a large number of mechanisms

were suggested to explain the production of fast particles (see, for instance, Anderson

et al., 1958; Haines, 1983; Trubnikov, 1986; Vikhrev, 1986; Deutsch and Kies, 1988;

Herold et al., 1988, a recent review given by Haines, 2001 and Ryutov et al., 2000). Ba-

sically, we can distinguish three mechanisms that exist in various modiﬁcations (Ryutov

et al., 2000):

instability.

– The ﬁrst explanation from the 1950s suggests that charged particles are acceler-
ated by a high inductive voltage in the neck during the development of an m = 0

– In another mechanism, the production of fast particles is ascribed to an adiabatic

compression of plasma in the neck of an instability.

– The third explanation is based on microinstabilities that could be triggered in a low
density plasma with high current density, for instance within m = 0 instabilities.

Microinstabilities then result both in strong anomalous heating and in the formation

of a non–Maxwellian tail of the ion velocity distribution.

If the charged particles are not of thermal origin, they have to be accelerated by the
voltage across the plasma UP = (RP + ˙LP)I + LP ˙I. In high current ﬁbre Z–pinches, there
was no evidence of pinching or expansion of a dense plasma at the time of disruption

112

5. Discussion

(see Robledo et al., 1997; Mitchell et al., 1998). The rise of plasma voltage could be

therefore explained by microinstabilities triggered in a low density plasma. At this point

we would like to draw the attention to the long duration of energetic particle emission.
Such long pulses (several tens of ns) can be hardly explained by ˙LP and ˙I because the
inductance and current would have to be changing for a very long time. The rise of

plasma resistance RP seems to be much more feasible.

In our experiment, we also observed the rapid rise–time of X–rays and relatively long

(several tens of nanoseconds) duration of X–ray pulse (cf. Fig. 4.23 on page 100). How-

ever, we do not have any experimental evidence of electron and ion beams and thus we

do not discuss the mechanisms of charged particle acceleration in greater detail. Instead

of that, we shall conclude this chapter by a report on bright spots that were observed in

our experiment.

Bright spots

Bright spots are localised plasma regions intensively radiating in visible, XUV and X–

ray spectral ranges. They were thoroughly studied ﬁrst in a vacuum spark (Cohen et al.,

1968). Since then they have been often observed in all types of Z–pinches. The tem-

perature, density and life–time of bright spots varied over several orders of magnitude
and diﬀerent kinds of bright spots have been reported. Even though the origin of bright

spots is still being discussed, it is clear that the nonlinear phase of the sausage instability,

radiative collapse and anomalous resistivity play a very important role (Vikhrev et al.,

1982; Erber et al., 2000).

In our experiment, we have to distinguish two types of bright spots. The ﬁrst group

of bright spots was produced during the plasma – on – ﬁbre phase. These bright spots

emitted less energetic photons than bright spots created in electrode vapour. To avoid
confusion, we call the latter ones “hot” spots. These hot spots arose from m = 0 insta-

bilities. Because the discharge occurred in electrode vapour, higher–Z ions (copper, tin,
etc.) increased radiation losses through line emission. After the ﬁbre ablation, m = 0 in-

stabilities could develop signiﬁcantly according to the radiative collapse model (see 2.1.2

on page 28). As far as the position of hot spots occurrence is concerned, they appeared

predominantly near the anode similarly to vacuum sparks (Koshelev and Pereira, 1991).

113

SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS

The following pages ﬁrst summarise the results obtained in our experiment. After that,

conclusions from these results are presented. Finally, prospects for the future are pro-

posed.

Summary

The primary aim of this thesis has been the study of the evolution and gross dynamics

of a ﬁbre Z–pinch. Our experiments were driven by a slow capacitive discharge of about

1 kJ energy. The current generator delivered 80 kA with 850 ns quarter period into a load.

Most of the experiments were performed in vacuum with carbon ﬁbres of 15 µm diameter

and about 1 cm length. The plasma was observed with a large number of diagnostic tools.

Particularly, simultaneous diagnostics (XUV spectra, VUV pinhole images and schlieren

images) were very helpful.

The characteristic feature of our experiments were XUV and X–ray pulses accompa-

nied with rises of voltage and with dips in dI/dt. In order to ﬁnd the origin of these pulses,

an in–depth experimental study was performed. During this study, we distinguished sev-

eral phases of our Z–pinch, namely the breakdown, latent phase, plasma – on – ﬁbre, ﬁbre
ablation, implosion of material evaporated from electrodes, development of m = 0 insta-

bilities and bright spots. We found out that XUV pulses were ﬁrst emitted during the

development of instabilities in the plasma – on – ﬁbre stage. After the ablation of a ﬁbre,

both XUV and X–ray pulses were generated from hot spots which developed in higher–Z

material evaporated from electrodes. The energetics of the Z–pinch and basic plasma

parameters were estimated in each phase. We also made an attempt to discuss relevant

heating mechanisms.

Summary, Conclusions and Prospects

Conclusions

In conclusion it should be stressed that the dynamics of a ﬁbre Z–pinch substantially
diﬀers from Z–pinches initiated from a metal wire. Even though ICF purposes caused

a carbon ﬁbre Z–pinch to be of a modest interest now, we believe that unique properties

of carbon could provide valuable data not only for Z–pinch physics but also for material

science in which carbon is often used. Our experiment with a carbon ﬁbre proved that it is

possible to study a lot of Z–pinch phenomena on a small device provided that a plasma is

thoroughly diagnosed. As an example we could mention the study of Z–pinch implosion
with the velocity above 105 m s−1 on the current level of 50 kA. Another interesting
phenomenon is the implosion onto a ﬁbre or wire. First, it oﬀers a new possibility of how

to transfer the current with a sharp rise–time in the vicinity of a ﬁbre or how to modify the

shape of an X–ray pulse. Next, the ﬁbre in the centre of an imploding plasma introduces

homogeneity to Z–pinch discharges. Last but not least, a ﬁbre can be used as a target for

an imploding plasma and can serve as a diagnostic tool.

Our results also showed that dynamics of a ﬁbre Z–pinch signiﬁcantly varies depend-

ing on a current generator used. In the case of a slow current rise–time, the implosion of

a coronal plasma onto a ﬁbre might occur late in the time. This way, more energy stored

in a capacitor bank could be transferred into a plasma.

Furthermore, the current waveform of a low impedance and low voltage capacitor
is quite sensitive to Z–pinch behaviour, especially to the change of the RP + ˙LP term.
Although this fact is considered to be a disadvantage, it can serve well some diagnostic

purposes. Since the voltage and current can be quite easily measured on a low voltage

generator, we can calculate a plasma resistance and energetics of a Z–pinch. Moreover,

if we assume cylindrical symmetry and Spitzer resistivity, the resistance and spectro-

scopically measured temperature determine the diameter of a plasma column in which

the current is ﬂowing. Then this diameter can be compared with the one estimated from

schlieren or pinhole images. Thus, we are coming to one of the main problem of Z–

pinches: what does the distribution of a current ﬂowing through a plasma look like? Of

course, it is necessary to measure the current distribution locally. However, the above

mentioned technique gives at least a rough estimation of a diameter.

115

Summary, Conclusions and Prospects

Future prospects

Present investigation describes only the gross dynamics of our ﬁbre Z–pinch. All of ob-

served phenomena could be studied in greater extent. Further experimental work depends

on the subject of interest, i.e. which of the observed phenomena we want to study in de-

tail. According to this interest, the diagnostics should be improved. One may attempt

to increase the current, to increase the length of a ﬁbre, to use more ﬁbres in one shot,

to detect a low density corona in the latent phase, to detect charged particles, to perform

X–ray spectroscopic measurement of hot spots, etc. But what should be improved in any

case, is the modelling without which it is almost impossible to get deeper insight into

Z–pinch phenomena.

It is well known that a ﬁbre Z–pinch does not belong to the main stream of Z–pinch
research because it is not such eﬃcient radiation source as high-Z wires. That is why

experiments with carbon ﬁbres are limited to basic research, i.e. to the study of general

phenomena such as plasma implosion, instabilities, bright spots, resistance, current distri-

bution, etc. However, the future work is not restricted to a carbon ﬁbre. The contribution

of our experiments lies also in the development of a comprehensive set of diagnostics,

which could be used for various Z–pinch loads and conﬁgurations.

Appendix A

APPLIED SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS

In order to introduce fundamental terms1 and to describe spectroscopic methods, we

present the basic theory of emission spectroscopy. As there are numerous spectroscopic

methods (see, for example, Griem, 1964, 1974, 1997; De Michelis and Mattioli, 1981;

Hauer et al., 1991; Thorne et al., 1999) we will deal only with those that were applied in

our experiment. Besides the aforementioned papers, our approach was also inspired by

several lectures of prof. H. J. Kunze and by the PhD thesis of one of his students (Aschke,

1999).

A.1

Introduction

The characteristic property of a plasma is the radiation in a large spectral range. Emission

spectroscopy is therefore a diagnostic technique that has been applied to an evaluation

of appropriate plasma parameters since the very beginning of plasma physics (Griem,

1964; De Michelis and Mattioli, 1981). By emission spectroscopy it is possible to mea-

sure plasma composition, electron temperature and density, ion temperature and density,

electric and magnetic ﬁeld, plasma motion or turbulence, plasma dynamics, ionization

dynamics, etc. (Kunze, 1989). However, to obtain some information about a plasma,

a lot of things have to be taken into account to exclude misinterpretation. That is also

the reason why we would like to brieﬂy delineate the process of how the plasma emis-

sion is formed. We shall start with radiative and collisional processes which inﬂuence

the population of energy levels and hence the local emissivity of a plasma. After that we

will deal with radiative transfer. And ﬁnally we will describe how the plasma parameters

were estimated.

1 Partial LTE, optical depth, rate equations, etc.

A.2. Radiative Processes

A.2 Radiative Processes

Radiative processes in a plasma can be divided into three main groups according to the

type of transition. We can distinguish transitions (i) between free and free electrons, (ii)

between free and bound electrons, and (iii) between bound and bound electrons.

– Free–free transitions are associated with a gain or loss of an electron energy in the
ﬁeld of an ion2. The loss of the electron energy into the radiation is connected with

the deceleration of electrons and that is why we speak about Bremsstrahlung. The

absorption of a photon by an electron is called the inverse Bremsstrahlung. Free
states are not quantised, therefore radiation/absorption is characterised by a broad

continuum.

– Free–bound transitions correspond to the radiative recombination and photoion-

ization processes. Recombination continuum extends from each bound state of an

electron and is characterised by edges. Similarly, the absorption edges occur in the

spectral dependence of the photoionization cross–section.

– Bound–bound transitions occur when an electron bounded by an ion makes a tran-

sition to another bound state. When the ﬁnal state has lower energy than the initial

one, the photon of well–deﬁned energy is emitted. The inverse mechanism is the

photoexcitation. The radiation is characterised by emission or absorption spectral

lines.

The rate of spontaneous emission from an upper energy level “u” to a lower level
“l” is deﬁned by means of the Einstein probability coeﬃcient Aul as follows:

where nu is the number density of electrons in the upper level. The overall rate of

spontaneous radiative transitions from the upper level “u” is given by the sum of

the rates from the upper level “u” to all lower levels

A.3. Collisional Processes in Plasma

It is quantum electrodynamics that treats of the transition probability Aul and of-

fers selection rules. As far as our experiments with carbon ﬁbres are concerned,
we identiﬁed only (allowed) electric dipole transitions with (cid:104)l|e(cid:126)r|u(cid:105) (cid:44) 0. The in-
tercombination (spin–forbidden (cid:52)S (cid:44) 0) lines are not usually observed for low–Z

elements, such as carbon, where the spin–orbit interaction is small.

Fig. A.1:
(Radiative processes are illustrated as wavy lines.)

Several possible radiative and collisional processes.

A.3 Collisional Processes in Plasma

Similarly to radiative processes, we can distinguish between collisional excitation – de-

excitation, ionization – recombination, etc. But on the contrary to radiative processes,

collisional transitions between two states do not follow any selection rules. The crucial

collisional process in a plasma is an interaction of a bound electron with free electrons.

The collision of a bound electron with ions is much less signiﬁcant due to the substantial
diﬀerence in mass.

138

A.3. Collisional Processes in Plasma

When a free electron collides with an electron bounded in an ion A, excitation or

ionization of a bound electron can occur:

Az + e− ↔ Az∗ + e−

(excitation, de-excitation)

Az + e− ↔ Az+1 + e− + e−

(ionization, three-body recombination)

In three-body recombination, i.e. the inverse of collisional ionization, an excited bound
state of the ion Az is formed and the excess energy is given to a free (non-captured)

electron. The cross–section of this reaction is increasing with the square of the electron

density ne and is larger for transitions into highly excited levels. On the contrary to

that, the radiative capture (radiative recombination) of an electron occurs mainly into the

ground state:

Az+1 + e− ↔ Az + hν

(radiative capture, photoionization)

In the case of a high–temperature and low density plasma (ne < 1016 cm−3), the domi-
nant recombination process is dielectronic recombination: a free electron is resonantly

captured into an excited level, with simultaneous excitation of one of the electrons of the
recombining ion Az+1. A doubly–excited ion Az∗∗ is formed:

Az+1 + e− ↔ Az∗∗

(dielectronic recombin., autoionization)

As the doubly–excited state is above the ﬁrst ionization limit of the recombined ion,

it is highly unstable. The two electron excited state can either undergo the inversion

process (autoionization) or radiatively decay by the emission of photons. Dielectronic

recombination is responsible for the occurrence of satellite spectral lines on the long–

wavelength side of resonance lines. Satellites on the long–wavelength side can be also

emitted after the innershell excitation:

Az + e− → Az∗∗ + e−

(innershell excitation)

Lastly, we shall mention the charge–exchange recombination that happens during colli-

sion between two ions or between an ion and atom. When the charge of the ion A is

greater than that of the ion B, the electron bounded in the ion A could be captured by the

other ion B into a highly excited level:

AzA + BzB → AzA−1 + BzB+1

(charge–exchange recombination)

The quantitative description of collisional processes begins with a microscopic cross–

section σ(v). The number of transitions “a” (of an ion A induced by electrons) per unit

139

time and per unit volume is given by equation

Ra = −

(A.3)

dnA

where (cid:104)σ(v) · v(cid:105) = (cid:82)
σ(v) fe(v)vdv represents the so–called rate coeﬃcient. The rate
coeﬃcient is calculated by the averaging of σ(v) · v over the electron velocity distribution
fe(v). For the excitation/deexcitation rate coeﬃcient we usually use symbol X. Symbol
S represents the ionization rate coeﬃcient and symbol α stands for the recombination
coeﬃcient. The quantity Ca is called the probability of collision “a” of one ion A with
electrons.

A.4 Charge State Distribution and Population of Energy Levels

The rate of radiative and collisional processes in a plasma determines the charge state

distribution and population of each energy level.

A.4.1 Charge state distribution

A given degree of ionization is given by ionization and recombination of two neighbour-
ing ionization degrees as well as by diﬀusion and convection of ions. In principle, the

charge state distribution can be solved from the equation of continuity

+ ∇ · Γz = ne(nz−1S z−1 − nzS z) + ne(nz+1αz+1 − nzαz)

(A.4)

where Γz stands for the ﬂux density of ions with the charge z.

Some simpliﬁcation can be made if transport of ions is neglected, i.e.

= ne(nz−1S z−1 − nzS z) + ne(nz+1αz+1 − nzαz)

(A.5)

∂nz
∂t

∂nz

In Z–pinch plasmas, one has to usually solve a time–independent system of equations

0 = ne(nz−1S z−1 − nzS z) + ne(nz+1αz+1 − nzαz)

(A.6)

which leads to the so–called ionization equilibrium. This set of rate equations could be
solved if plasma parameters and the recombination and ionization rate coeﬃcients α, S

are known.

A.4. Charge State Distribution and Population of Energy Levels

A.4.2 Level populations

Once the calculation of the charge state distribution was described, we are going to dis-

cuss the level populations in the particular ionization stage of interest.

In order to simplify notation, the rate of all collisions ﬁlling the upper level “u” will

(A.7)

Compared with atomic time constants τu = 1/(Au→ + Cu→), ne and Te change usu-
ally slowly. It means that the population density nu could be assumed to be in quasi–
equilibrium, i.e. dnu/dt = 0. From the rate equation A.7 we therefore obtain the popula-
tion of upper level in collisional–radiative equilibrium

nu =

(A.8)

An analytic solution taking into account all processes is too complicated and so it is

necessary to use numerical simulation (for our purposes we used the time–dependent

atomic physics code FLY described in appendix B). However, simpliﬁcation of equa-

tion A.8 is still possible in two limiting cases. The ﬁrst case is a low density plasma with
ne < 1014 cm−3 where the population follows the corona equilibrium. In what follows, we
will restrict to the second limiting case, to a high density plasma in local thermodynamic

equilibrium (LTE).

The sum goes over all bounded states i. The number of terms that are included in the

partition function depends not only on the plasma temperature but also on the density.

Since the collision processes are dominant we can further assume that the velocities

of ions and electrons are described by a Maxwell distribution with a temperature identical

with that of the Boltzman distribution.

3 Every process must be balanced by its exact inverse.

142

A.6. Prerequisites for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium

To sum up, local thermodynamic equilibrium represents the equilibrium between par-

ticles. Then the plasma can be described by the Maxwell, Boltzmann and Saha distribu-

tion with the same temperature Te. Temperature Te may vary from one place to another,
hence the name “local”. The complete thermodynamic equilibrium is further described
by the Planck blackbody function for radiation energy with the same temperature T = Te
as previous distributions. This may not to be valid for plasma in LTE where the radiation

density could be below the blackbody level.

A.6 Prerequisites for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium

The ﬁrst necessary condition of LTE is a Maxwell distribution of electron velocities.

Another condition is given by the validity of reducing equation A.8 to equation A.9. It
means that inequality Au→ (cid:28) Cu→ has to be satisﬁed. Usually a factor of ten is considered
as suﬃciently high, i.e. 10 Au→ ≤ Cu→. Unfortunately, it is impossible to derive any easy
criterion for complete LTE (i.e. for populations of all levels of all ionic states). The
review of De Michelis and Mattioli (1981) provides the necessary, though not suﬃcient,

criterion

ne ≥ 1.8 × 1014 (cid:112)

kTe∆E3
ul

[eV; cm−3]

(A.14)

This criterion is diﬃcult to satisfy especially for the largest energy level diﬀerence ∆Eul
in the level scheme. Nevertheless, for any value of density ne, the collisions still dominate

between high–lying levels. Level, above which excited states are in equilibrium with the

ground state of the next ionization stage, is called thermal limit. Then we talk about

a plasma in partial LTE. We use the following criterion (Griem, 1964)

ne ≥ 7 × 1017 (z + 1)6

TH

(cid:114)

EH

that determines the minimal electron density ne which is needed for partial LTE of levels
above the principal quantum number nTH. Here z is the eﬀective nuclear charge and
EH (cid:17) 13, 6 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen.

As regards our experiment, it follows from equation A.15 that the LTE approximation

cannot be applied for K–shell lines of carbon ions. However, if the electron density is
higher than a few times of 1019 cm−3, PLTE may be valid for levels n ≥ 2 of Li–like

oxygen ions (see Fig. 4.28 on page 105).

143

A.7. Radiative Transfer

A.7 Radiative Transfer

Until now we have been interested in the inﬂuence of collisional and radiative processes

on the population of energy levels. It was important since the population of energy level

nu and the transition probability of spontaneous emission Aul determine the local emission

in a plasma. The local emission is described by the emissivity, the power emitted per unit

solid angle per Hz by unit volume

(cid:15)ν = d3Φ
dVdΩdν

(cid:15)(u → l) = hν

Aulnu

Lν =

d3Φ
dA cos θdΩdν

The emissivity is given by all radiative transitions u→l

The importance of emissivity lies in the fact that it contains information about local

properties of the plasma. However, it is impossible to measure the emissivity directly

by passive emission spectroscopy. We usually measure the spectral radiance Lν at the

surface of a plasma: the power emitted per unit solid angle per Hz by unit projected area

The relation between these two quantities is trivial only in the case of an optically thin

plasma where the absorption and re-emission of photons are neglected. Otherwise we

have to solve the equation of radiative transport, which may be written for the line of

sight along the x–axis as

dLν((cid:126)r, Ω) =

(cid:21)
(cid:20)
(cid:15)ν((cid:126)r, Ω) − κ(ν,(cid:126)r)Lν((cid:126)r, Ω)
dx

(A.19)

Here κ(ν,(cid:126)r) represents the eﬀective absorption coeﬃcient that could be negative if stim-

ulated emission occurs. Now we shall deﬁne a quantity called the source function S ν((cid:126)r).
It can be expressed as the ratio of the emissivity to the absorption coeﬃcient

S ν((cid:126)r, Ω) = (cid:15)ν((cid:126)r, Ω)
κ(ν,(cid:126)r)

(A.20)

144

A.7. Radiative Transfer

And by using the optical depth τ(ν,(cid:126)r)

we can rewrite equation A.19 as follows:

dτ(ν,(cid:126)r) = κ(ν,(cid:126)r)dx

dLν((cid:126)r, Ω)
dτ(ν,(cid:126)r)

= S ν((cid:126)r, Ω) − Lν((cid:126)r, Ω)

Unfortunately, this equation cannot be solved in general because the emissivity and ab-
sorption coeﬃcient may have diﬀerent spectral dependence. Moreover, the absorption of

photons inﬂuences the population of energy levels and thus it is necessary to solve the

equation A.22 together with the system of equations A.7.

The solution of equation A.22 can be found only in limiting cases. If we suppose

the homogenous plasma with the characteristic length along the line of sight lΩ and the

spatially isotropic source function S ν we arrive at the relation

Lν = S ν(1 − e−τ(ν))

(A.23)

dτ(ν,(cid:126)r) = κ(ν)lΩ.

where τ(ν) = (cid:82)
One of the limiting cases occurs when the plasma is optically thin (τ (cid:28) 1), i.e. without
absorption, we can use the Taylor series e−τ(ν) ≈ 1 − τ(ν). Then we obtain

(cid:90)

Lν ≈

(cid:15)ν((cid:126)r, Ω)dx = (cid:15)νlΩ

Another limiting case is when τ (cid:29) 1. Then we can derive

Lν = S ν = (cid:15)ν
κ(ν)

ehν/kT − 1

The last equality in equation A.25 is valid only in the case of the plasma in LTE. The

limiting case τ (cid:29) 1 is not reached in the entire spectral range. Since the absorption
increases with λ2, the plasma becomes optically thick towards long wavelength (Kunze,

1989). As far as shorter wavelengths are concerned, the emission lines become optically

thick more readily than continuum.

A.8. Intensity of Spectral Lines

From the spectroscopic point of view, it is necessary to recognise whether a spectral

line is optically thick. For Doppler–broadened lines and the plasma in LTE, the optical
thickness at the line centre ν0 = c/λ0 is given by

τ(ν0) = rB

λ0 flunllΩ

(cid:114)

πMic2

(A.26)

where rB = e2/4πε0mec2 is the classical (Bohr) electron radius. When substituting known
constants in the previous equation, we get the relation

Here the ion mass Mi is in atomic units mu, temperature kT is in eV, the population of
lower level nl is in m3, the wavelength λ0 is in nm, and the length of plasma lΩ is in m.

Whether the emission lines are optically thick or thin, can be checked experimentally

by comparing relative intensities of close multiplet lines. The radiance ratio of two op-

tically thin multiplet lines is determined by the statistical weights of lower levels gl and
the oscillator strengths flu

As regards our experiment, we found that the C VI Ly–α line and O VI 2p–3d line

Intensity of Spectral Lines

In the scientiﬁc literature there is often used the term intensity of a spectral line I. The

fact of the matter is that the correct term is the spectral radiance Lν (mostly spatially
and/or temporally integrated). However, as the term “intensity” became common, we use

it in this thesis in spite of the fact that the spectral radiance would be more appropriate.

146

A.9. Spectroscopic Measurements of Plasma Parameters

A.9 Spectroscopic Measurements of Plasma Parameters

The emission spectroscopy of plasma belongs to one of the fundamental passive diag-

nostic technique. The emissivity of plasma contains much information about plasma

properties and dynamics. The key issue is the choice of a suitable method which enables

the estimation of plasma parameters, especially the electron temperature and density. Our

choice of a method was predetermined by the properties of our grating spectrograph (see

subsection 3.5.5 on page 52). The spectrograph enabled us to measure relative inten-

sities of spectral lines only. The measurement of line proﬁle was not possible due to

limited spectral resolution. That is why the manifold choices of spectroscopic techniques

(cf. Griem, 1964, 1997; De Michelis and Mattioli, 1981) are reduced to only several

fundamental methods.

Spectroscopic measurement of temperature and density

First, it is important to mention that spectroscopic measurement of temperature is actu-

ally the measurement of a parameter determining certain equilibrium distribution (Thorne

et al., 1999). We can thus distinguish between the electron temperature Te and the ion
temperature Ti. Moreover, we can distinguish between the electron temperature occur-

ring in the Maxwell velocity distribution, in the Boltzmann distribution A.11 (so-called

population or excitation temperature), in the Saha–Boltzmann equation A.12 (ionization

temperature), etc. Unless any equilibrium distribution exists, the temperature cannot be

deﬁned and the plasma has to be described by distribution functions themselves. Most

of the spectroscopic temperature measurements primarily yield electron temperature Te.

The same was true in our case. The kind of the electron temperature (excitation, ioniza-

tion, etc.) follows from the method used and it is not speciﬁed in our work.

In this thesis we applied the following spectroscopic methods of the temperature and

density measurement:

– Very easy and undemanding method of a rough temperature measurement is the

identiﬁcation of ionic states in a plasma. It holds that an ionic state with ionization

potential Eion is reached in a plasma when the electron temperature obeys

Te > CiEion

(A.29)

with Ci varying approximately between 0.1 and 0.3 (Hauer et al., 1991).

147

A.9. Spectroscopic Measurements of Plasma Parameters

More accurate value of temperature can be obtained from calculation of ionization

equilibrium (the temperature dependence of population of various ionic states).

The free parameter in this calculation is the electron or ion density. To calculate

ionization equilibrium we used atomic physics code FLY.

– Another common method is based on relative line intensities of the same ion. Pro-

vided that the plasma is in LTE or at least in partial LTE, the population of energy

levels follows the Bolzmann distribution A.11. Then the ratio of two optically thin

spectral lines is given by

Lν
Lν(cid:48)

= Aulguλ(cid:48)
Au(cid:48)l(cid:48)gu(cid:48)λ

· e−(Eu−Eu(cid:48) )/kTe

(A.30)

It can be clearly seen from Eq. A.30 that, except several constants, the ratio is
dependent only on the electron temperature. The suﬃcient sensitivity is achieved
for Eu − Eu(cid:48) > kTe. This method can be extended to a higher number of lines than
two. We can make a graph with ln(Lνλ/guAul) on the x–axis and with the energy of
upper level Eu on the y–axis. The slope of the line then equals −kTe. This method
was used in cases when the code FLY could not be applied, e.g. for Be–like ions.

– In the regions where (partial) LTE approximation is no more valid, the ratio of two

spectral lines is not only temperature–, but also density–dependent. Under such cir-

cumstances a detailed accounting must be made of the ionization, recombination,

excitation, deexcitation and radiative transfer. As far as this work is concerned, we

used the code FLY not only to calculate the ratio of line intensities in non–LTE

approximation (usually in collisional–radiative equilibrium) but also to reconstruct

the whole synthetic spectrum for a particular temperature and density. Non–LTE

requires more complicated treatment than LTE approximation, but on the other

hand, it could provide the estimation of density which was very needed since the
other methods of density measurement4 cannot be applied.

4 For instance, Stark broadening, depression of ionization potential, Inglis–Teller limit, the ratio of

resonance and intercombination lines of He–like ions.

Appendix B

CODE FLY

B.1 Basic Parameters

FLY (Lee, 1995, 1996) is a commercially available suite of computer codes which was
developed for analysing experiments where K–shell spectra1 are observed. The FLY suite

is capable of simulating K–shell emitters with the atomic number Z from 2 to 26, i.e. from

helium to iron. The suite allows the user to calculate the population of the states in an

LTE or non–LTE approximation by assuming steady–state or a time dependent evolution.

The kinetics model FLY provides details of the level populations of hydrogen–, helium–

and lithium–like ions. Less ionised species are represented as a ground state only. FLY is

a “zero–dimension” suite of codes, thus the plasma is speciﬁed with the local conditions.
The optical depth eﬀects are approximated for a homogenous plasma “column” only. The

most important characteristics of the suite can be summarised in the following items:

– 0-dimension post-processing of MHD.

– Atomic number Z from 2 to 26, i.e. from helium to iron.

– K–shell spectroscopy: detailed information on H-, He- a Li- like ion stages. K-

shell satellite lines and also continuum radiation are included.

– Steady-state (either LTE, or non-LTE) as well as time–dependent solution of rate

equations.

only.

– Line proﬁle synthesis: Doppler proﬁle. Stark broadening for speciﬁc transition

– Eﬀect of optical depth within the escape factor approximation.

– Possibility of external radiation ﬁeld.

– Easy to use. Comparison of the synthetic spectrum with the experimental one.

1 K–shell spectroscopy is engaged in the radiative transitions to the most inner shell (K–shell) of ions.

149

B.2. Description

The suite of code consisted of three parts – FLY, FLYPAPER and FLYSPEC codes.

B.2 Description

B.3 FLY

The ﬁrst code in the suite, FLY, calculates the level populations of hydrogen–, helium–

and lithium–like ions. The population of energy levels can be solved either in non–LTE

or LTE case. The rate equations for populations include the most relevant ionising, re-

combining, exciting and deexciting processes. The necessary input is the atomic number

of interest together with the history of magnetohydrodynamic parameters. The other

possible input is the grid of temperature and density for which the populations will be

calculated. When the time history of plasma parameters is known, the code calculates

a time–dependent evolution of the populations. When a grid of temperatures and den-

sities is the input, the code computes a steady state approximation of population levels.

The output ﬁle of the FLY code serves as an input into the other two codes of the suite

— FLYPAPER and FLYSPEC.

B.4 FLYPAPER

FLYPAPER code can be used to evaluate:

– populations of levels,

– the ratio of line intensities,

– optical depth

as a function of the time or plasma parameters (density and temperature).

B.5 FLYSPEC

FLYSPEC code allows the reconstruction of the synthetic spectrum for a particular time

or for particular temperature and density. The line proﬁles can be calculated for certain
the Lyman and Balmer series for hydrogen–like ions, 1s2 1S0 – 1s np 1P
transitions for helium–like ions, and transitions to the ground levels 2s, 2p in the case of

transitions:

lithium–like ions. The recombination emission is calculated for mentioned series only.

In addition, the user can perform integrations of spectra over time.

150

B.6. Code Limitation

B.6 Code Limitation

Firstly, it should be stressed that the FLY suite is a 0–dimension code. Therefore, the cor-

rect treatment of radiative transfer (which is a non–local problem especially where a den-

sity gradient occurs) is not possible. Moreover, only Doppler broadening is incorporated
in the FLY code and therefore the optical depth eﬀects are overestimated.

Secondly, if we need to obtain synthetic spectra of L– or M– shell emitters we also

need to use another code than FLY. This is true also for detail description of a Li–like

ionization state because a lower excited state (Be–like) is described only by a single
ground state2. Since the FLYSPEC code includes recombination for certain transition

only, the continuum spectrum is underestimated.

Thirdly, the appropriate use of any post–processors assumes that preceding MHD

modelling of plasma evolution is not inﬂuenced by the fact that the detail radiative pro-

cesses are not included. This condition may not be fulﬁlled in a strongly radiating plasma

consisting of high–Z elements.

Fourthly, another serious problem represents non–Maxwellian distribution of elec-

trons since it often occurs along the z–axis in a Z–pinch plasma and cannot be described

by means of electron temperature.

Lastly, it should be mentioned that the FLYSPEC programme provides insuﬃcient

instrumental broadening. In order to compare the synthetic spectra with the experimental

ones, we have to therefore process the synthetic spectra with a spreadsheet programme.

B.7 Platform

The kernel of the suite FLY was written in FORTRAN77 language. Running the code

does not require any atomic and spectroscopic data since they are internally included.
Programme runs on any UNIX/Linux workstation as well as on desktop PC under MS-

DOS.

2 This restriction was overcome in FLYCHK, the extension of FLY (Chung et al., 2003).

Appendix C

DEUTERATED FIBRE EXPERIMENT ON S–300 FACILITY

We have studied ﬁbre Z–pinch not only on a small device Z–150 but also on a large

pulsed power facility S–300 in Moscow. This appendix presents the results that were

accepted for publishing in Physica Scripta in 2006.

C.1

Introduction

The dense Z–pinches initiated from cryogenic deuterium ﬁbres were investigated in the

80’s and 90’s in connection with the research of controlled thermonuclear fusion and

radiative collapse (Scudder, 1985; Sethian et al., 1987; Decker and Kies, 1989; Lebedev

et al., 1998). The plan was to heat and ionise the ﬁbre from frozen deuterium and to

conﬁne the high density and high temperature plasma column within a small diameter.

The ﬁbres from deuterated polymer were also employed (Stephanakis et al., 1972; Young

et al., 1977; Kies et al., 1991; Mitchell et al., 1998) because their discharge behaviour was

roughly the same (cf. Lebedev et al., 1998) and at the same time they were easily available

and could be handled much easier than the frozen deuterium ones. Unfortunately, the

development of MHD instabilities and global expansion of a pinch column were observed

from the very beginning of the discharge and so the idea of the ﬁbre Z–pinch as a fusion

reactor was abandoned.

The purpose of our ﬁbre experiments on the S–300 generator was (i) to compare

to study the generation of XUV and X–ray radiation together with the neutron production

which gives insight into the acceleration of ions and hence into the processes taking place

C.2 Apparatus and Diagnostics

C.2.1 Current generator and Z–pinch load

So far most experiments with dielectric ﬁbres have been pursued on high impedance
(about 1 Ω) pulsed power generators since they are better optimised to drive currents

into a high impedance load, which a dielectric ﬁbre surely is (cf. Mitchell et al., 1996).

Despite this, however, we carried out ﬁbre Z–pinch experiments on a low impedance S–
300 generator (3.5 MA, 100 ns, 0.15 Ω, Chernenko et al., 1996) at the Kurchatov Institute

in Moscow. The experiments were performed at a current level of 2 MA with a rise time

of about 150 ns. The Z–pinch was formed in a vacuum chamber from a deuterated

polyethylene ﬁbre of 100 µm diameter and 1 cm length.

C.2.2 Diagnostics

In order to study dynamics of Z–pinch plasma, an extensive set of diagnostic tools was

used. The diagnostic set–up is displayed in Fig. C.1.

Fig. C.1: Diagnostic set–up on the S–300 generator, Moscow.

First, to provide time and space resolved information about visible emission, an op-

tical streak camera was used. The streak camera was performed in the radial mode,

i.e. with a slit parallel to the Z–pinch axis.

Second, X–ray radiation was detected with two X–ray pinhole cameras, XUV grazing

incidence spectrograph, and 11-channel soft X–ray polychromator. One X–ray pinhole

camera, which was gated, recorded 4 frames with 2 ns exposure and 10 ns inter-frame

separation. All four frames were ﬁltered with 24 µm thick beryllium. The other pin-

153

C.3. Experimental Results

hole camera, time–integrated and diﬀerentially ﬁltered (without a ﬁlter, and with 5 µm
and 24 µm mylar), was used to observe the plasma in various spectral ranges with the

spatial resolution of 100 µm. Even better spectral information was obtained by a time–

integrated XUV grazing incidence spectrograph which recorded carbon K–shell lines.

Time resolved studies of soft X–ray emission was conducted using an 11-channel poly-

chromator. The various combinations of glancing incidence mirrors, transmission ﬁlters,

and semiconductor detectors enabled the detection of photons in channels of 50, 80, 120,

180, 270, 365, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 2200 eV.

And ﬁnally, as far as neutrons are concerned, a time–of–ﬂight analysis of neutrons

was made possible by two axially positioned SSDI–8 scintillators at the distance of 2.70

m and 7.45 m (downstream). The neutron yield was measured by an indium activation

counter. Since the activation counter has not been calibrated in situ and since we have

some experimental evidence that the yield was underestimated by one order of magni-

tude, it is possible that the neutron yields should be multiplied by 10 throughout this

article and references (Kl´ır et al., 2004a, 2005).

C.3 Experimental Results

C.3.1 Current waveform and X–ray emission

The results of a number of diagnostic tools from the discharge no. 030606-1 are shown

in Fig. C.2–C.5.

In Fig. C.2 we present the current waveform, optical streak photograph, and some
X–ray characteristics. Time t = 0 corresponds to the start of the current at the ﬁbre.

The streak photograph shows that the optical emission began early in the discharge. The

optical emission was continuing for several hundreds of nanoseconds and its intensity

was modulated by several peaks. Similarly, the soft X–ray power (measured by the

11-channel polychromator) was peaking more than once. The peak power of sub-keV

radiation reached 30 GW near the maximum current. The total emitted energy exceeded

5 kJ.

Also, it could be observed that the pinch consisted of several distinct layers. We could

distinguish a low density coronal plasma and higher density interior layers. The coronal
plasma was expanding with the radial velocity of about 2 × 106 cm/s (see Fig. C.2).

Interior layers were displayed by the X–ray pinhole cameras (see Fig. C.3).

The time–integrated soft X–ray images (Fig. C.3.a and C.3.b) show a radiating sub-

millimetre core. Several bright spots were observed near the cathode and anode. Some of

them were smaller than 100 µm in diameter, i.e. smaller than the spatial resolution of the

pinhole camera. At the peak of the soft X–ray pulse (Fig. C.3.d and C.3.e), the “harder”

radiation came from several bright spots near the anode. [Take note of the fact that the
detection eﬃciency varied between sections of MCP detector. For that reason the de-

creasing emission recorded by the pinhole camera (Fig. C.3.c-C.3.e) did not correspond

to the increasing power of soft X–rays (Fig. C.2).] Another noticeable feature in Fig. C.3

is the radiation from the anode which indicates runaway electrons in outer regions. On

the basis of other experiments (Lebedev et al., 1998), we assume that the strong radiating

plasma near the cathode (Fig. C.3.c) was the expanding electrode material.

155

C.3. Experimental Results

Fig. C.4 presents the temporally and spatially integrated spectrum in the 200÷600 eV

spectral range where K–shell lines of carbon ions occurred. The plasma parameters de-
termination is somewhat problematic since the opacity eﬀects with space– and time–

dependence have to be taken into account. To simulate the spectrum with one temper-

ature and one density was therefore impossible. Nevertheless, most features of the ob-

tained spectrum were simulated with the “integrated” electron temperature Te of 120 eV
(cf. the synthetic spectrum in Fig. C.4). The estimation of the electron density ne was
ambiguous owing to its dependence on the choice of the optical path length lΩ. The only

feature that was not included in the synthetic spectrum was the strong continuum of He–

like ions. This continuum could originated from the part of plasma volume with higher
density (ne > 1021 cm−3) and lower temperature (Te < 120 eV). As regards the emitted
energy of the carbon Ly–α line, the 365 eV channel of the polychromator measured the

total energy of about 30 J.

C.3.2 Neutron measurements

The results of neutron measurements are demonstrated on shot no. 030606-1 that was

described above. In this shot, an indium activation counter detected the modest neutron
yield of 2 × 107. The yield was calculated assuming the isotropic emission over a sphere.

Furthermore, we determined the production time and mean energy of neutrons from

two time–of–ﬂight scintillators situated at distances of 2.70 and 7.45 m away from the

156

C.4. Discussion

pinch. The output from these two scintillators is shown in Fig. C.5. To make the graph

in Fig. C.5 clear, X–ray pulses from both scintillators were placed over each other. The
time–of–ﬂight of X–rays and the delay of photomultiplier were included. Time t = 0

corresponds to the start of the current and hence the time axis is the same as in Fig. C.2.

In Fig. C.5, three hard X–ray pulses emitted in shot no. 030606-1 can be seen. The

time–of–ﬂight analysis proved that each of X–ray pulses was accompanied with the neu-

tron production. The X–ray pulse no. 1, 2, and 3 corresponded to the neutron pulses

no. 1,2, and 3, respectively. Most of the neutrons were emitted at the third hard X–ray

pulse. As Fig. C.2 shows, the third X–ray pulse corresponded both to the peak of soft

X–rays and to the noticeable change in the current waveform. The mean neutron energy

(measured in the axial, downstream direction) of all three pulses was 2.45 ± 0.05 MeV

which corresponds to the D–D reaction.

C.4 Discussion

The experimental results presented in this paper are similar to other ﬁbre Z–pinch ex-

periments. There was no indication of globally collapsing pinch although the Pease–

Braginskii current (600 kA for polyethylene ﬁbres) was exceeded. This rapid expansion

is usually explained by the anomalous resistivity in a low density corona (Chittenden,
1995) and/or turbulent heating arising from MHD instability growth (Riley et al., 1996).
As for MHD instabilities in our experiment, the evidence of an m = 0 mode was given

157

C.4. Discussion

by the X–ray pinhole camera which recorded bright spots.

The key issue of our experiment was the modest neutron yield of about 107 per one
shot. Contrary to that, the neutron yields between 109 and 1010 were typical in other ﬁbre

Z–pinches even with a lower current (cf. Stephanakis et al., 1972; Sethian et al., 1987;

Kies et al., 1991; Mitchell et al., 1998; Lebedev et al., 1998). One of the possible expla-

nations for that could be a diameter of a ﬁbre used. Stephanakis et al. (1972) reported

that neutron yield was decreasing with the increasing diameter of a ﬁbre. For instance,

100 µm diameter ﬁbres produced ten times fewer neutrons than ﬁbres of 20 µm diameter.

Another fact that could play an important role is the current generator. At this point we

could mention the disappointing results and the modest neutron yield reported by Decker

and Kies (1989) on a “low” impedance SPEED 2 generator.

Another signiﬁcant result we obtained was the mean energy of neutrons, which was

near the value of 2.45 MeV. In addition to that, the time of neutron production corre-

sponded to the soft X–ray emission (cf. Fig. C.2 and Fig. C.5) and hence the detected

neutrons could be of thermonuclear origin. This result would be consistent with the Z–

pinch experiments initiated from thicker (> 40 µm) ﬁbres on the Gamble II (Young et al.,

1977) and Kalif (Kies et al., 1991) generators. Such conclusion seems to be more opti-

mistic than the beam–target mechanism reported on the Poseidon (Sethian et al., 1987)

and MAGPIE (Mitchell et al., 1998) generators. However, the shift from 2.45 MeV

could be too small to be identiﬁed. Therefore, it is still feasible that the neutron yield was

caused by beam–target interactions at a relatively slow motion of dense plasma regions.

The beam–target mechanism is also supported by the “integrated” electron temperature

of 120 eV that is too low even for the modest neutron yield produced by thermonuclear

way. This discrepancy was also observed by the HDZP group in Los Alamos National

Laboratory. The explanation they proposed was the model of instability heating in which

the ion temperature Ti was substantially higher than the temperature of electrons Te (Ri-
ley et al., 1996). Ion temperature Ti higher than the electron temperature Te was also
observed during the stagnation in wire–array Z–pinches and was ascribed to ion viscous

heating within ﬁne–scale interchange instabilities (Haines et al., 2004). Another expla-

nation how to reconcile the observed neutron yield with a low electron temperature is
that only a small part of the plasma volume was heated to a suﬃciently high temperature.

Then the bulk of the plasma could remain cold. But even if the fusion mechanism were

thermonuclear, it would still hold that the neutron yield was modest in our experiment

158

C.5. Conclusion

and that the yield higher than 1010 has not been reported by other research groups.

Finally, we compare our ﬁbre Z–pinch with the implosion of a wire–array onto a deut-

erated ﬁbre. Both experiments were carried out on the same current generator S–300 with

similar deuterated ﬁbres and currents (Kl´ır et al., 2004a, 2005). We found out that the

neutron yield was one order of magnitude higher in the case of the implosion of a wire–
array. Another diﬀerence we observed was a slight shift of the neutron mean energy from

2.45 MeV towards higher energies (Kl´ır et al., 2005).

C.5 Conclusion

The dense Z–pinch formed from a deuterated polyethylene ﬁbre was studied on the “low”

impedance S–300 pulsed power generator at the Kurchatov Institute. The majority of

observed phenomena were in agreement with other ﬁbre Z–pinch experiments carried out

on “higher” impedance generators. The important result was obtained by the time–of–

ﬂight analysis which determined the mean neutron energy of about 2.45 MeV. However,
the modest neutron yield of 2 × 107 per shot was one order of magnitude lower than in

our experiments with the implosion of a wire–array onto a ﬁbre.

Appendix D

MATLAB SIMULATION OF R–L–C CIRCUIT

WITH TIME–DEPENDENT RESISTANCE

The equivalent circuit of our Z–pinch is shown in Fig. 3.6. We can substitute this circuit
by the R–L–C circuit where C stands for C0, L stands for L0 + LP(t), and R(t) stands for
R0 + RP(t) + ˙LP(t). Because the plasma inductance LP is much lower than L0 and depends
on the pinch radius logarithmically, we consider the inductance L to be constant. It is

therefore possible to solve the R–L–C circuit with a time–dependent resistance only.

Nonlinear evolution of a trans-Alfv´enic shock wave (TASW), at which the ﬂow velocity passes
over the Alfv´en velocity, is computed in a magnetohydrodynamic approximation. The analytical
theory suggests that an inﬁnitesimal perturbation of a TASW results in its disintegration, i.e., ﬁnite
variation of the ﬂow, or transformation into some other unsteady conﬁguration.
In the present
paper, this result is conﬁrmed by numerical simulations. It is shown that the disintegration time is
close to its minimum value equal to the shock thickness divided by a relative velocity of the emerging
secondary structures. The secondary TASW that appears after the disintegration is again unstable
with respect to disintegration. When the perturbation has a cyclic nature, the TASW undergoes
oscillatory disintegration, during which it repeatedly transforms into another TASW. This process
manifests itself as a train of shock and rarefaction waves, which consecutively emerge at one edge
of the train and merge at the other edge.

I. INTRODUCTION

It has long been believed that trans-Alfv´enic shock
waves (TASWs), at which the ﬂow velocity passes over
the Alfv´en velocity, cannot exist in the real world. Since
a stationary trans-Alfv´enic shock transition was obtained
in a numerical simulation [1], this conventional view point
was replaced by an opposite view point. The overall
claim was that there is no principal diﬀerence between
TASWs and fast and slow shocks, at which the ﬂow is
super- and sub-Alfv´enic, respectively. At the same time,
the contradiction inherent in a stationary TASW, which
follows from an analytical theory, was not lifted. To rec-
oncile this contradiction, it was suggested that a TASW
exists in an unsteady state in which it is repeatedly de-
stroyed and recovered [2]. In the present paper, we show
by way of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation that
the evolution of a TASW may have the form of oscil-
latory disintegration, i.e., reversible transformation into
another TASW.

The disintegration of an arbitrary hydrodynamic dis-
continuity was considered for the ﬁrst time by Kotchine
[3]. After that, Bethe [4] studied the disintegration of
shock waves. In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the shock
may disintegrate only in a medium with anomalous ther-
modynamic properties. The magnetic ﬁeld enlarges the
number of possible discontinuous structures thus giving
additional degrees of freedom for the disintegration. The
disintegration conﬁgurations of arbitrary MHD disconti-
nuities were obtained in Refs. [5]. Furthermore, it has
been shown that trans-Alfv´enic shock transitions can be
realized also through a set of several discontinuities [6],
in contrast with fast and slow transitions. However, this
fact on its own does not assure that the shock disinte-
grates.

The important feature that predetermines the disinte-
gration of TASWs is their nonevolutionarity. The prob-
lem of evolutionarity was initially formulated for the
fronts of combustion [7] and hydrodynamic discontinu-
ities [8]. Evolutionarity is a property of a discontinuous
ﬂow to evolve in such a way that the ﬂow variation re-
mains small under the action of a small perturbation.
This is not the case for a nonevolutionary discontinuity.
At such a discontinuity, the system of boundary condi-
tions, which follow from the conservation laws, does not
have the unique solution for the amplitudes of outgoing
waves generated by given incident waves. From a math-
ematical view point this means that the number of un-
known parameters (the amplitudes of the outgoing waves
and the discontinuity displacement) is incompatible with
the number of independent equations. Since a physical
problem must have the unique solution, the assumption
that the perturbation of a nonevolutionary discontinu-
ity is inﬁnitesimal leads to a contradiction. In fact, the
inﬁnitesimal perturbation results in disintegration, i.e.,
ﬁnite variation of the initial ﬂow, or transformation into
some other unsteady conﬁguration.

The evolutionarity requirement gives additional re-
strictions on the ﬂow parameters at a shock, compared
to the condition of the entropy increase. The restrictions
appear because the direction of wave propagation (to-
ward the discontinuity surface or away from it), and thus
the number of the outgoing waves, depends on the ﬂow
velocity. If the velocity is large enough then the given
wave may be carried down by the ﬂow. Therefore, at an
evolutionary discontinuity, the ﬂow velocity must be such
that it provides the compatibility of the boundary equa-
tions. This form of evolutionarity condition was applied
to MHD shock waves in Refs. [9,10]. As a result, the fast
and slow shocks are evolutionary, while the TASWs are

1

nonevolutionary.

This classical picture was challenged when Wu [1] ob-
tained a stationary TASW in a numerical simulation.
The existence of a stationary numerical solution does not
mean of course that the shock is stable with respect to
disintegration or transition into another unsteady ﬂow.
Wu [11] demonstrated that a TASW, which is subfast
upstream and subslow downstream, disintegrates under
the action of a small Alfv´en perturbation with a large
enough characteristic time. Nevertheless, this numerical
result was interpreted as being in a contradiction with
the principle of evolutionarity and stimulated the eﬀorts
to modify or even disprove this principle.

It was suggested that the free parameters that describe
a nonunique structure of a TASW [12] or the amplitudes
of strongly damping dissipative waves [13] should be in-
cluded in the number of unknown parameters when solv-
ing the problem of evolutionarity. This would make the
TASW evolutionary.
In both cases, however, the per-
turbation is conﬁned within the shock transition layer.
Consequently, it does not enter into the boundary con-
ditions, which relate the quantities far enough from the
transition layer, and thus it does not contribute to the
evolutionarity [14].

Wu [12] also argued that the TASW whose nonevolu-
tionarity is based on separation of Alfv´en perturbations
from the remaining perturbations [10] becomes evolution-
ary in the case of a nonplanar shock structure because
in this case the separation formally does not take place.
However, as shown by Markovskii [14], the coupling of
the small-amplitude Alfv´en modes with a low enough fre-
quency to the remaining modes is weak (unless the shock
is of the type close to one of the degenerate types, Alfv´en
discontinuity or switch shocks). Therefore the coupling
becomes essential only when the small perturbation gen-
erates large variation of the ﬂow, which is the same result
as predicted by the principle of evolutionarity.

There is one more ﬁnding that favors the nonexis-
tence of stationary TASWs. As discussed by Kantrowitz
and Petschek [15], the TASWs are isolated solutions of
Rankine-Hugoniot problem, which do not have neighbor-
ing solutions corresponding to small deviations of bound-
ary conditions. Wu and Kennel [16] introduced a new
class of trans-Alfv´enic shock-like structures with non-
coplanar boundary states. The thickness of such a struc-
ture increases in the course of time, and it eventually
It was thus

shown that neighboring to a TASW are time-dependent
conﬁgurations, which are not solutions of the Rankine-
Hugoniot problem.
In addition, Falle and Komissarov
[17] recently considered stationary TASWs of all possi-
ble types and showed that the shocks disintegrate if the
boundary values deviate from their initial values.

Strictly speaking, a TASW, in contrast with fast and
slow shocks, becomes a time-dependent shock-like struc-
ture once it is perturbed by a small-amplitude Alfv´en
wave because the Alfv´en wave violates the coplanarity
condition. This fact, already on its own, means that the

TASW becomes unsteady under the action of the small
perturbation. However, the scenario for its evolution de-
pends on the initial conﬁguration and on the nature of
the perturbation. After the disintegration, the magnetic
ﬁeld reversal given at the initial nonevolutionary shock
may be taken either by a secondary TASW or by an
Alfv´en discontinuity. Both structures are nonevolution-
ary [2,14]. Therefore single disintegration does not lift
the contradiction inherent in a TASW. The main ques-
tion that we solve in this paper is what happens to the
post-disintegration nonevolutionary conﬁguration. We
show that the secondary TASW is again unstable with re-
spect to disintegration and that the evolution of a TASW
may have the form of oscillatory disintegration. In Sec.
II, we describe the simulation method. In Sec. III, we
discuss the results of the calculations. Our conclusions
are presented in Sec. IV.

We solve Eq.

(1) using a uniform grid and an ex-
plicit conservative Lax-Wendroﬀ ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme
with physical dissipation [18]. The time step is limited
by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition and by
the dissipation timescale. The boundary values are ob-
tained by hyperbolic interpolation. The numerical inter-
50 < x < +300 is covered by 2600 grid points. The
val
interval is chosen in such a way that no large-amplitude
wave reaches the boundaries during the computation
time. Small-amplitude waves pass through the bound-
aries without any detectable reﬂection which could aﬀect
the ﬂow inside the simulation region. We have tested our
code for a smaller mesh and a corresponding time step
determined by the CFL condition as well as for the same
mesh and a time step smaller than that determined by
the CFL condition. The test showed that there is no con-
siderable dependence of our results on the mesh size and
time step.

Equation (2) does not exactly describe the shock struc-
ture. Therefore the ﬂow undergoes time variations until
it adjusts to a stationary shock transition. The result-
ing boundary values diﬀer slightly from those given by
(4) but the diﬀerence is less than 1%. The con-
Eq.
servation laws for these new values are fulﬁlled with the
precision less than 0.1%. The stationary conﬁguration is
then perturbed by a small-amplitude Alfv´en wave with
0.025
l =
(Fig. 1). Note that δBz is about 50 times smaller than
. Although in the case of an upstream incident
|
wave the perturbation of Bz and vz (not shown) is carried
to the downstream region, the boundary conditions for
the Alfv´en waves are incompatible. Therefore the given
Alfv´en perturbation pumps Bz and vz into the shock or
out of the shock, depending on the sign of Bz inside the
transition layer. Since Bz inside the transition layer is
nonzero, the shock behaves in diﬀerent ways under the
action of the perturbations with positive and negative
δBz. If the shock and the perturbation carry Bz of the
same sign, the shock disintegrates into a II
III shock
of a smaller amplitude, a large-amplitude slow shock,
and some other structures of a much smaller amplitude
(Fig. 2a,b).

−

→

If the shock and the perturbation carry Bz of oppo-
site signs, the situation is somewhat peculiar. The main
secondary structures are a TASW and a slow rarefaction
(Fig. 3a,b). However, these structures do not become
separated. The reason is that the secondary TASW is of
a so-called II
IV = III type [19]. This means that the
downstream velocity at the shock is exactly equal to the
slow magnetosonic velocity. Therefore there is no disinte-
gration in the usual sense but the conﬁguration becomes
unsteady because the right boundary of the slow rarefac-
tion moves away from the TASW, while the left boundary
remains attached to the shock. Note that the rarefaction
wave is attached to the TASW not at the density peak
but somewhere to the right of the peak. This is related
to the fact that the density proﬁle of a II
IV shock
has a maximum (see, e.g., Ref. [11]), in contrast with the
monotonic proﬁle of a II

III shock.

→

From the moment when the Alfv´en wave with δBz > 0
arrives to the shock, the disintegration starts almost im-
mediately, in contrast with the result of Wu [11]. The rea-
son is that the disintegration time depends on the shock
type and on its initial state. This can be understood as
follows. The important characteristic of a TASW, intro-
duced by Kennel et al. [19], is the integral of Bz over the
transition layer,

depends on the boundary values, and it tends to inﬁnity
when the shock approaches an Alfv´en discontinuity or a
switch shock, which is intermediate between evolutionary
and nonevolutionary shocks. This result was obtained
for almost parallel small-amplitude shocks, but one may
expect that it remains qualitatively valid in the general
case.

When an Alfv´en wave is incident on a TASW,

changes Iz. If we start from a planar I
IV
shock (Iz = 0), as in the case studied by Wu [11], the
quantity
ﬁrst has to reach the value Iz0. Only after
that it falls into the forbidden region, and the disinte-
gration starts. In the case of a II
III shock, there is
a diﬀerent situation. Since Iz takes only distinct val-
ues Iz0 and
Iz0, the disintegration starts immediately,
and the disintegration time is close to its minimum value
L/V, approximately equal to 30 in our case, where V is
a relative velocity of the secondary discontinuities.

Let us now follow the further evolution of the post-
disintegration conﬁguration under the action of a small
perturbation. Our main conclusion is that the secondary
TASW is again unstable with respect to disintegration.
At the same time, the way of evolution depends on a
form of the perturbation. We ﬁrst discuss the case where
the perturbation of the secondary TASW is such that
Iz continues to increase or decrease, in particular where
the perturbation is equal to its initial positive (Fig. 2b,c)
or negative (Fig. 3b,c) value. If the perturbation of Bz
is positive then the shock spreads in space, with all the
jumps, except for ∆By and ∆vy, decreasing in time. It
thus approaches a large-amplitude Alfv´en wave. If the
perturbation is negative, the shock ﬁrst passes through
the state in which Iz = 0. This is not in a contradiction

We now turn to a cyclic perturbation. We impose the
(3) in such a way that
perturbation described by Eq.
Bz changes sign at x =
40 and the Alfv´en wave now
carries the perturbation of the same amplitude but oppo-
site sign. After the ﬁrst disintegration starts (at t = 20
for δBz > 0 and at t = 670 for δBz < 0), the opposite
sign perturbation arrives to the TASW each 150 units
of time. The resulting conﬁguration is such that the in-
is repeatedly replaced by its decrease, and
crease of
the shock undergoes oscillatory disintegration. The dis-
integration conﬁgurations after several cycles are shown
in Figs. 4 and 5. As can be seen from the ﬁgures, the
conﬁguration emits a sequence of contact discontinuities.
The contact discontinuities move with the ﬂow velocity,
which is approximately equal to that given by Eq. (4c).
The corresponding time interval between the discontinu-

ities is equal to 150.

Downstream of the TASW, there is a wave train, which
consists of slow shock and rarefaction waves. These struc-
tures are not standing in the ﬂow. They consecutively
emerge at the left edge of the train and merge at the
right edge. The merging is seen in Fig. 4b at x
150.
We note that, in the case of a negative initial perturba-
tion, the transition through the state with Iz = 0 is not
necessary for the oscillatory disintegration to occur. If
the perturbation changes sign for the ﬁrst time before
Iz becomes negative, the disintegration conﬁguration is
similar to that shown in Fig. 5, except for the sign of Iz
inside the shock.

Finally, the shock comes to a steady state only in a
degenerate case where the perturbation of the secondary
TASW exactly compensates the nonzero value of Bz and
vz outside of the transition layer. We emphasize that
in all but the degenerate cases the small Alfv´en pertur-
bation makes the TASW unsteady, in contrast with fast
and slow shocks. However, there remains a question. For-
mally, the initial TASW becomes a time-dependent struc-
ture, much like the secondary TASW, since the Alfv´en
perturbation arrives to the initial shock. The question
is why the initial TASW disintegrates when Iz increases
monotonically, while the secondary TASW does not. To
answer this question, we ﬁrst mention that the secondary
TASW is more close to a ﬁnite-amplitude Alfv´en wave
than the initial shock. Alfv´en waves, as well as switch
shocks, are singular structures. As shown by Kennel et
al. [19], the quantity dIz0/dq tends to inﬁnity as the shock
approaches these singular structures. Here q = By↑/By↓
characterizes the jumps of the boundary values at the
shock with a given Iz, and Iz0(q) is an allowed curve in
which a II

III shock has a stationary structure.

Assume now that the initial shock is in the state
Iz = Iz0(q0). A small Alfv´en perturbation changes Iz.
For the shock to remain in the curve Iz0(q), a change
In the general case, the variation of
of q is required.
Iz is comparable with the variation of q, and thus with
the jumps of the boundary values at the TASW. In this
case, the evolution has the form of disintegration. By
contrast, if the shock is close to the singular structure,
the given variation of Iz requires a small variation of q,
and the jumps of the boundary values are adjusted to
Iz0(q) in a diﬀusion-like manner. It should be mentioned
that the curves Iz0(q) were obtained by Kennel et al.
[19] for small-amplitude shocks propagating almost par-
allel to the magnetic ﬁeld. Nevertheless, we speculate
that, in our simulation, the initial TASW has a small
enough dIz0/dq to disintegrate, while for the secondary
TASW the quantity dIz0/dq is large enough to dim the
disintegration. Such an explanation does not imply that
a TASW cannot disintegrate more than one time in prin-
ciple. Furthermore, in our simulation run with a positive
constant δBz, there is an evidence for a possible second
disintegration at t = 380. However, the second disinte-
gration is too faint to contend that it indeed takes place.

We have performed a numerical simulation of a trans-
Alfv´enic shock wave. The shock that we have considered
is of a II
III type, i.e., it is subfast upstream and super-
slow downstream. We have shown that the shock disin-
tegrates under the action of a small Alfv´en perturbation.
The resulting conﬁguration includes a secondary TASW,
a large-amplitude slow shock or rarefaction wave, and
other small-amplitude structures. We have also demon-
strated that the secondary TASW is again unstable with
respect to disintegration. When the perturbation has a
cyclic nature, the shock undergoes an oscillatory disin-
tegration. This result is in a qualitative agreement with
our previous ﬁnding [2]. This process shows up as a train
of slow shock and rarefaction waves, which consecutively
emerge at one edge of the train and merge at the other
edge. At the same time, the disintegration conﬁguration
of a small-amplitude almost parallel TASW discussed by
Markovskii [2] includes alternating TASWs and Alfv´en
discontinuities rather than alternating TASWs. This dis-
crepancy is explained by the fact that, in the approxima-
tion used in Ref. [2], the diﬀerence between the secondary
TASW and the Alfv´en discontinuity manifests itself in
higher orders.

In contrast with the results of Wu [11], the disintegra-
tion starts almost immediately after the Alfv´en perturba-
tion arrives to the initial shock. The characteristic time
of this process is equal to that required for the secondary
structures to become separated. The reason for this can
be seen as follows. TASWs have a nonunique structure.
IV shock transition studied by Wu [11], as well
A II
III transition, allows a continuous family of in-
as a I
tegral curves, while the II
III shock has two distinct

integral curves. For given boundary values, each integral
curve is ﬁxed by the deﬁnite parameter. The incident
Alfv´en wave changes the parameter and thus the shock

structure. In the case of a I

time passes until the parameter falls into a forbidden re-
gion, and only after that the shock disintegrates. In the
case of a II
III shock, its structure immediately be-
comes inconsistent with the boundary values under the
action of the Alfv´en wave, which initiates the disintegra-
tion.

Thus, our simulations conﬁrm that a TASW becomes
unsteady when it is perturbed by a small-amplitude inci-
dent wave. Furthermore, an almost vanishing perturba-
tion results in considerable dynamics at relatively small
timescales. The scenario for the shock evolution depends
on its initial state and on the nature of the perturba-
tion. In particular, the evolution may have the form of
oscillatory disintegration in which the shock repeatedly
transforms into another TASW.

We have performed quantum molecular dynamics simulations for dense helium to study the
nonmetal-to-metal transition at high pressures. We present new results for the equation of state
and the Hugoniot curve in the warm dense matter region. The optical conductivity is calculated via
the Kubo-Greenwood formula from which the dc conductivity is derived. The nonmetal-to-metal
transition is identiﬁed at about 1 g/cm3. We compare with experimental results as well as with
other theoretical approaches, especially with predictions of chemical models.

Hydrogen and helium are by far the most abundant
elements in nature. The investigation of their phase dia-
gram, especially at extreme conditions of pressure and
temperature,
interest but
is not only of fundamental
also an indispensable prerequisite for astrophysics. For
instance, thermophysical properties of hydrogen-helium
mixtures determine the structure and evolution of stars,
White Dwarfs, and Giant Planets [1, 2, 3]. The detec-
tion of Jupiter-like planets orbiting neighboring stars [4]
has initiated a renewed interest in planetary physics. All
planetary models require an input of accurate equation
of state data in order to solve the hydrostatic equations
for a rotating compact object. While the limiting cases of
low and high densities are well understood within chem-
ical and plasma models, the intermediate region is much
more complex. There, a nonmetal-to-metal transition
occurs in both hydrogen and helium at pressures of sev-
eral megabar and temperatures of few eV which implies a
strong state-dependence of the interparticle interactions
and, thus, also of the thermodynamic variables. In this
paper, we study this warm dense matter region where the
uncertainties in the equation of state data, both experi-
mentally and theoretically, are greatest.

A lot of eﬀort has been done to understand the behav-
ior of warm dense hydrogen [5, 6]. Although the simplest
element in the periodic table, the transition of a non-
conducting molecular liquid to an atomic or plasma-like
conducting ﬂuid at high pressure is still not fully un-
derstood [7, 8, 9]. Helium seems to be a much simpler
system for the study of the high-pressure behavior since
no dissociation equilibrium between molecules and atoms
interferes with the ionization equilibrium, and the ﬁrst
(24.6 eV) and second ionization energy (54.4 eV) are well
separated. Surprisingly, only few experimental and the-
oretical studies exist for warm dense helium [10, 11, 12].

In this paper, we perform the ﬁrst comprehensive ab
initio study of the high-pressure behavior of helium. We
determine the equation of state (EOS) in the warm dense
matter region by means of quantum molecular dynamics
(QMD) simulations. The Hugoniot curve is derived and
compared with experimental points [13], other ab initio
calculations [14], as well as with results of eﬃcient chemi-
cal models [10, 11, 12]. Finally, we calculate the dynamic
conductivity via the Kubo-Greenwood formula and de-
rive the static conductivity and compare with shock wave
experimental data [20]. We locate the nonmetal-to-metal
transition in the high-pressure phase diagram and discuss
the related plasma phase transition (PPT).

QMD simulations are a powerful tool to calculate
the structural, thermodynamic, and optical properties
of warm dense matter in a combined ﬁrst-principles ap-
proach. Details of this method have been described else-
where [17, 21, 22, 23].

We have performed ab initio molecular dynamics simu-
lations employing a ﬁnite temperature Fermi occupation
of the electronic states using Mermins ﬁnite temperature
density functional theory (FT-DFT) [24]. The implemen-
tation of the QMD method comes from VASP (Vienna
Ab Initio Simulation Package), a plane wave density func-
tional code developed at the University of Vienna [25].
All electrons are treated quantum mechanically on the
level of DFT. The electronic wave function is relaxed at
each QMD step, which assumes decoupled electronic and
ionic time scales. We have chosen a simulation box with
32 to 64 atoms and periodic boundary conditions. The
electron wave functions are modeled using the projec-
tor augmented wave (PAW) potentials [26] supplied with
VASP [25]. These PAW potentials enable more accurate
results for conductivity calculations compared with other
pseudopotentials. The exchange correlation functionals

are calculated within generalized gradient approximation
(GGA). Our most accurate calculations were done using
the GGA parameterization of PBE [27]. The convergence
of the thermodynamic quantities in QMD simulations is
of signiﬁcant importance [28]. We have chosen a plane
wave cutoﬀ Ecut at 700 eV where the pressure is con-
verged to within 2%.

Performing QMD simulations to calculate the EOS of
He only the Γ point was used for the representation of
the Brillouin zone. Calculations for Al have shown that
it is not recommended to calculate higher-order k-point
sets [17]. Furthermore, the mean value point (1/4, 1/4,
1/4) was used for conductivity calculations.

Our simulations were performed for a canonical ensem-
ble where the temperature, the volume of the simulation
box, and the particle number in the box are conserved
quantities during a QMD run. To keep the tempera-
ture on a predeﬁned level, the ion temperature is reg-
ulated by a Nos´e-Hoover thermostat and the electronic
temperature is ﬁxed by Fermi weighting the occupation
of bands [25]. After about hundred time steps the sys-
tem is equilibrated and the subsequent 400 to 1000 time
steps are taken to calculate pressures, energies and other
quantities as averages over this simulation period.

First we present results for the thermal and caloric
EOS of warm dense helium in Figs. 1 and 2. The
isotherms of the pressure and the internal energy be-
have very systematically with temperature and density
and show no indications of an instability such as the
PPT at lower temperatures, contrary to results derived
within the chemical picture [10, 11, 12]. For instance, the
EOS of Winisdoerﬀer and Chabrier (WC) [12] is based
on a free energy minimization schema for a mixture of
helium atoms, single and double charged ions, and free
electrons. Correlations are taken into account based on
eﬀective two-particle potentials. It agrees well with our
QMD results for the pressure up to about 1 g/cm3 and
for ultra-high densities above about 50 g/cm3. How-
ever, this chemical model shows a systematic trend to
lower pressures in the intermediate, strongly coupled re-
gion where the QMD results already approach an almost
temperature-independent behavior as characteristic of a
degenerate electron gas. These results underline the sig-
niﬁcance of ab initio calculations for warm dense matter
states and will have a strong impact on calculations of
planetary interiors [29]. Furthermore, we can identify the
region where eﬃcient chemical models are applicable in
favor of time-consuming ab initio calculations.

Based on this EOS data, we have determined the Hugo-

niot curve via the condition

(E − E0) =

(P + P0)(V0 − V ),

which relates all ﬁnal states of a shock wave experi-
ment (E, P, V ) with the initial state (E0, P0, V0).
In
our calculations we have used the values E0 = 20 J/g,

T0 = 4 K, P0 = 1 bar≪ P , and V0 = 32.4 cm3/mol
(̺0 = 0.1235 g/cm3) for the ﬁrst shock and E1 = 57 kJ/g,
T1 = 15.000 K, P1 = 190 kbar, and V1 = 9.76 cm3/mol
(̺1 = 0.41 g/cm3) for the secound shock. We com-
pare our results with double-shock experiments of Nel-
lis et al. [13], with recent DFT-MD calculations of Mil-
itzer [14], and with two chemical models [12, 30] in Fig. 3.
A very good agreement is found with the double-shock
experiments as well as with the other theoretical Hugo-
niot curves up to about 1 g/cm3 which results from the
accordance of the EOS data up to this density as men-
tioned above. A central problem in this context is the
value and location of the maximum compression ratio
ηmax. The chemical model FVT+
id [30] is based on ﬂuid
variational theory and considers an ideal ionization equi-
librium in addition. This model predicts a value of 5.5
at 375 GPa and 50.000 K if the second shock of the ex-
periment is taken as initial state. Militzer [14] found a
maximum compression of 5.24 at 360 GPa and 150.000 K
for the principal Hugoniot starting at (E0, P0, V0) by
using an EOS composed of zero-Kelvin DFT-MD re-
sults accounting for excited states for lower tempera-
tures as shown in Fig. 3 and Path Integral Monte Carlo
(PIMC) data in the high-temperature limit. Note that
only a ﬁnite-temperature DFT calculation yields the self-
consistent thermal ground state of the system, which is

not equivalent to applying a thermal occupation of the
empty electronic states (“excited states”) obtained in a
zero-Kelvin electronic structure calculation as performed
in [14]; for details, see [31].

The QMD simulations were performed up to 1.5 g/cm3,
350 GPa, and 60.000 K where the maximum compression
ratio has not been reached yet. For still higher temper-
atures the number of bands increases drastically beyond
the scope of our computer capacity. Besides PIMC simu-
lations [14], orbital-free DFT methods may be applicable
in that high-temperature region [32]. Interestingly, the
maximum compression ratio for helium (ηmax ≥ 5) is
greater than that for hydrogen (ηmax = 4.25); see e.g. [6]
for a more detailed discussion.

FIG. 4: QMD results for the static conductivity are com-
pared with shock-wave experiments of Ternovoi et al. [20] be-
tween (15 − 25) × 103 K and isotherms of the COMPTRA04
model [34]; temperatures are indicated.

The dc conductivity follows from Eq. (2) in the limit
ω → 0. We compare with isentropic compression ex-
periments of Ternovoi et al. [20] performed in the range
(15 − 25) × 103 K and predictions of the partially ion-
ized plasma model COMPTRA04 [33, 34] in Fig. 4. The
experimental points show a very strong increase between
0.7 and 1.4 g/cm3 indicating that a nonmetal-to-metal
transition occurs. Using the Mott criterion for the mini-
mum metallic conductivity of 20000/Ωm also for ﬁnite
temperatures, this transition can be located at about
1.3 g/cm3. The QMD results reproduce the strong in-
crease found experimentally very well except for the low-
est density of 0.72 g/cm3 where the experimental value
is substantially lower than the QMD result.

The COMPTRA04 model [33, 34] calculates the ioniza-
tion degree and, simultaneously, the electrical conductiv-
ity accounting for all scattering processes of free electrons
in a partially ionized plasma. This approach is able to
describe the general trends of the electrical conductivity
with the density and temperature as found experimen-
tally, see [35]. The isotherms displayed in Fig. 4 cover
almost the range of the experimental points and agree
also with the QMD data so that the nonmetal-to-metal
transiton is described qualitatively very well.

The strong inﬂuence of the temperature on the dc con-
ductivity in this transition region can be seen by compar-
ing the QMD results for two temperatures at the same
density point; see Fig. 4. In order to exclude systematic
errors from the experimental temperature determination,
we have performed EOS calculations for the experimen-
tal points and compare typical values in Table I. A very
good agreement is obtained so that the discrepancy in the
conductivity data for the lowest density stems probably
from the band gap problem of DFT. In order to solve this
problem, DFT calculations beyond the GGA have to be
performed by using, e.g., exact exchange formalsims [36]
or quasi-particle calculations [37]. This is an important
issue of future work devoted to the nonmetal-to-metal

transition.

The origin of this nonmetal-to-metal transition can be
elucidated by inspecting the variation of the density of
states (DOS) along the path of the shock-wave experi-
ments, see Fig. 5. For the lowest density of 0.72 g/cm3,
a gap still exists in the DOS so that thermally activated
electron transport occurs as in semiconductors. With in-
creasing density, the gap region is slightly reduced. The
main eﬀect is, however, that electronic states ﬁll up the
region of the Fermi energy with increasing temperature so
that a higher, metal-like conductivity follows, see also [8].

In summary, we have determined the thermophysical
properties of dense helium within an ab initio approach.
The results show clearly the strong inﬂuence of quan-
tum eﬀects and correlations in the warm dense matter re-
gion. The nonmetal-to-metal transition occurs at about
1 g/cm3, in good agreement with shock wave experimen-
tal data. These new results will have a strong inﬂuence
on models for planetary interiors.

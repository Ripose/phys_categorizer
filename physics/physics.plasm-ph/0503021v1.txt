Abstract

The quantum hydrodynamic model for charged particle systems is ex-
tended to the cases of non zero magnetic ﬁelds. In this way, quantum
corrections to magnetohydrodynamics are obtained starting from the
quantum hydrodynamical model with magnetic ﬁelds. The quantum
magnetohydrodynamics model is analyzed in the inﬁnite conductivity
limit. The conditions for equilibrium in ideal quantum magnetohydro-
dynamics are established. Translationally invariant exact equilibrium
solutions are obtained in the case of the ideal quantum magnetohy-
drodynamic model.

1 Introduction

There has been an accrued interest on quantum plasmas, motivated by appli-
cations in ultra small electronic devices [1], dense astrophysical plasmas [2]-[4]
and laser plasmas [5]. Recent developments involves quantum corrections to
Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal equilibria [6], quantum beam instabilities [7]-[10],

quantum ion-acoustic waves [11], quantum corrections to the Zakharov equa-
tions [12, 13], modiﬁcations on Debye screening for quantum plasmas with
magnetic ﬁelds [14], quantum drift waves [15], quantum surface waves [16],
quantum plasma echoes [17], the expansion of a quantum electron gas into
vacuum [18] and the quantum Landau damping [19].
In addition, quan-
tum methods have been used for the treatment of classical plasma problems
[20, 21].

One possible approach to charged particle systems where quantum eﬀects
are relevant is furnished by quantum hydrodynamics models. In fact, hydro-
dynamic formulations have appeared in the early days of quantum mechanics
[22]. More recently, the quantum hydrodynamics model for semiconductors
has been introduced to handle questions like negative diﬀerential resistance
as well as resonant tunneling phenomena in micro-electronic devices [23]-
[25]. The derivation and application of the quantum hydrodynamics model
for charged particle systems is the subject of a series of recent works [26]-
[42].
In classical plasmas physics, ﬂuid models are ubiquitous, with their
applications ranging from astrophysics to controlled nuclear fusion [43, 44].
In particular, magnetohydrodynamics provides one of the most useful ﬂuid
models, focusing on the global properties of the plasma. The purpose of this
work is to obtain a quantum counterpart of magnetohydrodynamics, start-
ing from the quantum hydrodynamics model for charged particle systems.
This provides another place to study the way quantum physics can modify
classical plasma physics. However, it should be noted that the quantum hy-
drodynamic model for charged particle systems was build for non magnetized
systems only. To obtain a quantum modiﬁed magnetohydrodynamics, this
work also oﬀer the appropriated extension of the quantum hydrodynamics
model to the cases of non zero magnetic ﬁeld.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the equations of quantum
hydrodynamics are obtained, now allowing for the presence of magnetic ﬁelds.
The approach for this is based on a Wigner equation with non zero vector
potentials. Deﬁning macroscopic quantities like charge density and current
through moments of the Wigner function, we arrive at the desired quantum
ﬂuid model. In Section 3, we repeat the well known steps for the derivation
of magnetohydrodynamics, now including the quantum corrections present
in the quantum hydrodynamic model. This produces a quantum magneto-
hydrodynamics set of equations. In Section 4, a simpliﬁed set of quantum
magnetohydrodynamics is derived, yielding a quantum version of the general-
ized Ohm’s law. In addition, the inﬁnity conductivity case is shown to imply

2

an ideal quantum magnetohydrodynamic model. In this ideal case, there is
the presence of quantum corrections modifying the transport of momentum
and the equation for the electric ﬁeld. Section 5 studies the inﬂuence of the
quantum terms on the equilibrium solutions. Exact solutions are found for
translational invariance. Section 6 is devoted to the conclusions.

2 Quantum Hydrodynamics in the Presence

of Magnetic Fields

For completeness, we begin with the derivation of the Wigner-Maxwell sys-
tem providing a kinetic description for quantum plasmas in the presence of
electromagnetic ﬁelds. For notational simplicity, we ﬁrst consider a quantum
hydrodynamics model for non zero magnetic ﬁelds in the case of a single
species plasma. Extension to multi-species plasmas is then straightforward.
Our starting point is a statistical mixture with N states described by the
wave functions ψα = ψα(r, t), each with probability pα, with α = 1 . . . N. Of
N
α=1 pα = 1. The wave functions obey the Schr¨odinger

Here we consider charge carriers of mass m and charge q, subjected to pos-
sibly self-consistent scalar and vector potentials φ = φ(r, t) and A = A(r, t)
respectively. For convenience in some calculations, we assume the Coulomb
gauge,

A = 0.

From the statistical mixture, we construct the Wigner function f =

All macroscopic quantities like charge and current densities can be found
taking appropriated moments of the Wigner function. This is analogous
to classical kinetic theory, where charge and current densities are obtained
from moments of the one-particle distribution function. Alternatively, we
could have started from the complete many body wave function, deﬁned
a many body Wigner function and then obtained a quantum Bogoliubov-
Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. With some closure hypothesis, in this
way we arrive at a integro-diﬀerential equation for the one-particle Wigner
function, which has to be supplemented by Maxwell equations. This is the
Wigner-Maxwell system, which plays, in quantum physics, the same role the
Vlasov-Maxwell system plays in classical physics. When the vector potential
is zero, it reproduces the well known Wigner-Poisson system [45, 46].
In
addition, in the formal classical limit when ¯h
0, the Wigner equation (3)
goes to the Vlasov equation,

where v = (p

notice that a initially positive deﬁnite Wigner function can evolve in such a
way it becomes negative in some regions of phase space. Hence, it can not
be considered as a true probability function. Nevertheless, all macroscopic
quantities like charge, mass and current densities can be obtained from the
Wigner function through appropriated moments.

Equation (3) coupled to Maxwell equations provides a self-consistent ki-
netic description for a quantum plasma. As long as we know, it has been ﬁrst
obtained, with a diﬀerent notation, in the work [47]. It has been rediscovered
in [48], in the case of homogeneous magnetic ﬁelds. Wigner functions appro-
priated to non zero magnetic ﬁelds have also been discussed, for instance,
in [49]-[51], without the derivation of an evolution equation for the Wigner
function alone. More recently, a diﬀerent transport equation for Wigner func-
tions appropriated to non zeros magnetic ﬁeld and spin has been obtained in

4

[52]. The starting point of this latter development, however, is the Pauli and
not the Schr¨odinger equation as here and [47]. Finally, relativistic models
for self-consistent charged particle systems with spin can be found in [53].

Most of the works dealing with quantum charged particle systems prefer
to work with the wave functions and not directly with the Wigner function,
as in [54]. The impressive form of (3) seems to support this approach. In-
deed, probably (3) can be directly useful only in the linear or homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld cases. This justiﬁes the introduction of alternative descrip-
tions. At the coast of the loss of some information about kinetic phenemena
like Landau damping, we can simplify our model adopting a formal hydro-
dynamic formulation. Deﬁne the ﬂuid density

Equations (8)-(9) does not show in an obvious way any quantum eﬀects,
since ¯h is not explicitly present there. To found the hidden quantum eﬀects,
we follow mainly the style of references [26], [27] and [55], but now allowing
for magnetic ﬁelds. In the deﬁnition (2) of the Wigner function, consider the
decomposition

ψα = √nα eiSα/¯h ,

(10)

for real nα = nα(r, t) and Sα = Sα(r, t). Evaluating, the integral for the pres-
sure dyad, we get a decomposition in terms of “classical” PC and “quantum”

In the deﬁnitions of classical pressure dyad PC, we considered the kinetic

and the kinetic ﬂuid velocity associated to the statistical mixture,

In a similar way, the second term at the right hand side of equation (12) is
constructed in terms of uo
α, the osmotic ﬂuid velocity associated to the wave
function ψα,

and uo, the osmotic ﬂuid velocity associated to the statistical mixture,

We also observe that in terms of the ﬂuid density nα of the state α the density
n of the statistical mixture is given by

Notice that PC a faithful classical pressure dyad, since it comes from dis-
persion of the velocities, vanishing for a pure state.
Indeed, the classical
pressure dyad is the sum of a kinetic part, arising from the dispersion of
the kinetic velocities, and a osmotic part, arising from the dispersion of the
osmotic velocities. However, PC is not strictly classical, since it contains ¯h
through the osmotic velocities. In a sense, however, it is “classical”, since it
comes from statistical dispersion of the velocities.

In most cases, it suﬃces to take some equation of state for PC. For sim-
plicity, from now on we assume a diagonal, isotropic form Pij = δijP , where
P = P (n) is a suitable equation of state. Certainly, strong magnetic ﬁelds
have to be treated more carefully, since they are associated to anisotropic
pressure dyads. However, since we are mainly interested on the role of the
quantum eﬀects, we disregard such possibility here.

Now inserting the preceding results for the pressure dyad into the mo-

mentum transport equation (9), we obtain the suggestive equation

The equation of continuity (8) and the force equation (19) constitute our
quantum hydrodynamic model for magnetized systems. All the quantum
eﬀects are contained in the last term of the equation (19), the so called Bohm
potential.
In comparison with standard ﬂuid models for charged particle
systems, the Bohm potential is the only quantum contribution, and the rest
of the paper is devoted to study its consequences for magnetohydrodynamics.

3 Quantum Magnetohydrodynamics Model

The equations from the last Section were written for a single species charged
particle system. Now we generalize to a two species system. Consider elec-
trons with ﬂuid density ne, ﬂuid velocity ue, charge
e, mass me and pressure
Pe. In an analogous fashion, consider ions with ﬂuid density ni, ﬂuid velocity
ui, charge e, mass mi and pressure Pi. Proceeding as before, now starting
from the Wigner equations for electrons and ions, we get the following bipolar
quantum ﬂuid model,

In the equations (22-23), we have added some often used phenomenological
terms to take into account for the momentum transport by collisions. The
coeﬃcients νei and νie are called collision frequencies for momentum transfer
between electrons and ions [43, 44]. For quasineutral plasmas, global mo-
νei
mentum conservation in collisions imply meνei = miνie, so that νie ≪
when the ions are much more massive than electrons [43, 44].

Equations (20-28) constitute our complete quantum hydrodynamic model,
allowing for magnetic ﬁelds. When B
0, it goes to the well known quantum
hydrodynamic model for bipolar charged particle systems.

Several possibilities of study are open starting from (20-28). Here we are
interested in obtaining equations analogous to the classical magnetohydrody-
namic equations. In some places, for the sake of clarity and to point exactly
for the new contributions of quantum nature, we repeat some well known

steps in the derivation of classical magnetohydrodynamics. To proceed in
this direction, deﬁne the global mass density

and the global ﬂuid velocity

U =

where σ = ρme2/(memiνei) is the longitudinal electrical conductivity. Equa-

continuity equation (31), the force equation (35), the quantum version of the
generalized Ohm’s law (36), an equation of state for P , plus Maxwell equa-
tions, provides a full system of quantum magnetohydrodynamic equations.
However, it is probably still complicated and in the next section we propose
some approximations in the same spirit of those of classical magnetohydro-
dynamics.

4 Simpliﬁed and Ideal Quantum Magnetohy-

drodynamic Equations

Usually [43, 44], the left-hand side of the equation (36) is neglected in the
cases of slowly varying processes and small pressures. Also, for slowly varying
and high conductivity problems , the displacement current can be neglected
in Amp`ere’s law. Finally, we assume an equation of state appropriated for
adiabatic processes. This provides a complete system of simpliﬁed quantum
magnetohydrodynamic equations, which we collect here for convenience,

In equation (39), Vs is the adiabatic speed of sound of the ﬂuid. Gauss law
can be regarded as the initial condition for Faraday’s law. Also notice that
the Hall term J

Inserting (39) into (38), we are left with a system of 13 equations for 13
unknowns, namely, ρm and the components of U, J, B and E. This is our
quantum magnetohydrodynamics model. In comparison to classical magne-

tohydrodynamics, the diﬀerence of the present model rests on the presence
of two quantum corrections, the last terms at equations (38) and (42).

In the ideal magnetohydrodynamics approximation, we assume an inﬁnite
conductivity and neglect the Hall force at (42). This provides the following
ideal quantum magnetohydrodynamics model,

supplemented by the continuity equation (37) and the equation of state (39).
Taking into account (39), equations (44-45) plus the continuity equation
provides a system of 7 equations for 7 unknowns, namely, ρm and the compo-
nents of U and B. This is our ideal quantum magnetohydrodynamics model.
In comparison to classical ideal magnetohydrodynamics, the diﬀerence of the
present model rests on the presence of a quantum correction, the last term
at equation (44). Interestingly, taking the curl of (43) makes disappear one
of the quantum correction terms present in the non ideal quantum magne-
tohydrodynamics. This leads to a dynamo equation (45) identical to that
of classical magnetohydrodynamics. Consequently, for inﬁnite conductivity
the magnetic ﬁeld lines are still frozen to the ﬂuid, even allowing for the
quantum corrections proposed here. In fact, even for ﬁnite conductivity, the
diﬀusion of magnetic ﬁeld lines is described by the same diﬀusion equation
as that of classical magnetohydrodynamics. This comes from the fact that
the quantum correction disappear after taking the curl of both sides of (42),
neglecting the Hall term and assuming a constant σ as usual. However, a
further quantum correction on the electric ﬁeld still survives through (43).

In order to obtain a deeper understanding of the importance of quantum
eﬀects, we propose the following rescaling for our ideal quantum magnetohy-
drodynamic equations,

¯ρm = ρm/ρ0 ,
¯r = Ωir/VA ,

¯U = U/VA ,
¯t = Ωit ,

¯B = B/B0 ,

(46)

11

where ρ0 and B0 are the equilibrium mass density and magnetic ﬁeld.
In
addition, VA = (B2
0/(µ0ρ0))1/2 is the Alfv´en velocity and Ωi = eB0/mi is the
ion cyclotron velocity. We justify the chosen rescaling in the following way.
In magnetohydrodynamics, the Alf´en velocity provides a natural velocity
scale. Also, since we deal with low frequency problems, Ω−1
is a reasonable
candidate for a natural time scale. These velocity and time scales induces
the length scale VA/Ωi, as shown in (46).

Applying the rescaling (46) to the ideal quantum magnetohydrodynamic

equations, we obtain the following non dimensional model,

Numerically, using M.K.S. units, we have H = 3.42
is the ambient particle density. While for ordinary plasmas H is negligible,
1034 m−3, H
for dense astrophysical plasmas [2]-[4], with n0 about 1029
can be of order unity or more. Hence, in dense astrophysical plasmas like the
atmosphere of neutron stars or the interior of massive white dwarfs, quantum
corrections to magnetohydrodynamics can be of experimental importance.
Similar comments apply to our non ideal quantum magnetohydrodynamics
model. However, even for moderate H quantum eﬀects can be negligible if
the density is slowly varying in comparison with some typical length scale,
due to the presence of a third order derivative at the Bohm potential. This
is in the same spirit of the Thomas-Fermi approximation.

5 Quantum Ideal Magnetostatic Equilibrium

There is a myriad of developments based on classical magnetohydrodynam-
ics (linear and nonlinear waves, dynamo theory and so on) and we shall not
attempt to reproduce all the quantum counterparts of these subjects in the
framework of our model. We will be restricted to just one subject, namely
the construction of exact equilibria for ideal quantum magnetohydrodynam-
ics, with no attempt to study the important question of the stability of the
equilibria.

Assuming that U = 0 and that all quantities are time-independent, the

ideal quantum magnetohydrodynamic equations (43-45) becomes

According to (51), the equilibrium solutions of ideal quantum magnetohydro-
dynamics are not electric ﬁeld free any longer. In addition, equation (52) has
an quantum correction that invalidate the classical magnetic surface equation
for B

B = 0, namely P + B2/(2µ0) = cte.

Equation (52) together with an equation of state is the key for the search
of equilibrium solutions. We will try to follow, as long as possible, the strat-
egy of reference [56] for classical magnetostatic equilibria. Inspired by well
known classical solutions [56], assume a translationally invariant solution of
the form

P = P (r, ϕ) ,
B =
A(r, ϕ)

ρm = ρm(r, ϕ) ,
ˆz + Bz(r, ϕ)ˆz ,

using cylindrical coordinates and where A = A(r, ϕ) and Bz = Bz(r, ϕ) as
well as the pressure and the mass density are functions of (r, ϕ) only.

nature, with important implications in what follows. The reason why ¯h does
not appear in (61) is that it factor at the right hand side of (59).

From (60) and some subjacent equation of state, P = P (ρm), we deduce

for some function G = G(A). Plugging this into (61), the result is

Recapitulating, we have three four functions of A to be stipulated, namely
F , G, K and P . However, A satisfy two diﬀerent equations, (63) and (64).
Once A is found, all other quantities (pressure, mass density, electromagnetic
ﬁeld) comes as consequences.

A reasonable choice is to take G as a linear function of A, since then (63)

becomes linear in the derivatives. Hence, let

G = k1A + k2 ,

k1

= 0 ,

(66)

for numerical constants k1 and k2. We take k1
= 0 since k1 = 0 would imply
F = 0, making disappear the quantum correction at (64). With the choice
(66), the couple (63-64) becomes

The last equation deﬁne K up to an unimportant numerical constant.

Equation (67) is the key equation for our translationally invariant mag-
netostatic equilibria. For a given F (A) and solving (67) for A, all other
quantities follows for a known equation of state. Indeed, knowing A we can
construct the radial and azimuthal components of the magnetic ﬁeld through
(54) and the mass density from (62). From the mass density and the equa-
tion of state, we obtain the pressure P . Proceeding, equation (69) yields
K(A) and then the z component of the magnetic ﬁeld through (65). Finally,
the electric ﬁeld follows from (51) and the current density from the curl of
the magnetic ﬁeld. The free ingredients to be chosen to construct explicitly
the exact solution are the function F (A) and the equation of state, and the
numerical constants k1 and k2. Other possibilities can be explored if we do
not restrict to linear G(A) functions as in (66), but then A will not satisfy
an linear in the derivatives equation.

where B0 is an arbitrary constant magnetic ﬁeld, k is an arbitrary constant

with A given by the cat eye solution (72). If desired, the electric ﬁeld and the
current density can then be calculated via (51) and Amp`ere’s law respectively.
In ﬁgure 1, we show the contour plot of the function A given by (72), while
in ﬁgure 2 we show the corresponding mass density. The parameters chosen
were B0 = 1, k = 1, ε = 0.9, k1 = 1 and k2 = 0. These graphics shows
coherent, periodic patterns resembling quantum periodic solutions arising in
other quantum plasma systems [26]. Similar graphics can be easily obtained
for the electromagnetic ﬁeld and other macroscopic quantities derivable from
the cat eye solution (72).

6 Conclusion

In this work, we have obtained a quantum version of magnetohydrodynam-
ics starting from a quantum hydrodynamics model with nonzero magnetic
ﬁelds. In view of its simplicity, this magnetic quantum hydrodynamics model
seems to be an attractive alternative to the Wigner magnetic equation of Sec-
tion 2. The inﬁnite conductivity approximation leads to an ideal quantum
magnetohydrodynamics. For very dense plasmas and not to strong magnetic
ﬁelds, the quantum corrections to magnetohydrodynamics can be relevant,
as apparent from the parameter H derived in Section 4. Under a number of
suitable assumptions, we have derived some exact translationally invariant
quantum ideal magnetostatic solutions. More general quantum ideal mag-
netostatic equilibria can be conjectured, in particular for axially symmetric
situations. In addition, we have left a full investigation of linear waves to
future works.

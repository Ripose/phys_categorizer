Abstract

Exact nonlinear equations for magnetosonic shocklets in a uniform hot magnetoplasma are de-

rived by using the nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic equations. Analytic as well as numerical solu-

tions of the nonlinear equations are presented. Shock-like structures of the ion ﬂuid velocity and

magnetic ﬁeld (or the plasma density) perturbations are obtained. The results may have relevance

to the understanding of fast magnetosonic shocklets that have been recently observed by onboard

instruments of the Cluster spacecraft at the Earth’s bow shock.

In the past, there has been a great deal of theoretical interest (e.g. Refs.

[1, 2, 3]) in

studying the properties of nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic waves in plasmas. It has been

found that both slow and fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves can propagate in the form of

either solitary or shock waves in plasmas. Very recently Stasiewicz et al.

[4, 5] reported

detailed properties of slow magnetosonic (SM) solitons [4] and FMS shocklets [5], which

have been observed by a ﬂeet of four Cluster spacecraft at the quasi-parallel bow shock.

Observations reveal that SM solitons [6] are associated with large amplitude compressional

(rarefactional) magnetic ﬁeld (plasma density) variations. On the other hand, FMS shocklets

are accompanied with compression of the plasma density and magnetic ﬁeld perturbations.

In this Brief Communication, we present a nonlinear model for FMS shocklets, which

may account for the observed FMS shocklets at the Earth’s bow shock. Speciﬁcally, we

show that FMS shocklets are associated with the nonlinear steepening [7] of arbitrary large

amplitude FMS waves in a high-beta magnetoplasma.

The dynamics of the nonlinear FMS waves in a magnetized plasma is governed by the

inertialess electron momentum equation

We are interested in studying the nonlinear properties of one-dimensional FMS waves

In the zero-β limit, Eqs. (11) and (12) agree completely with Eqs. (2a) and (2b) of Stenﬂo et

al. [8] who demonstrated rapid steepening of the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld perturbations

leading to the formation of FMS shocklets in a cold magnetoplasma.

In the following, we study the properties of FMS shocklets in a warm magnetoplasma.

where h(u) is given by Eq. (18) and f is a function of one variable, determined from the

initial condition at t = 0; the velocity u can be evaluated for diﬀerent x and t by solving

Eq. (22) for u. Equation (22) describes a nonlinear FMS wave propagating in the positive x

direction, where the time-dependent solution has a typical structure of the wave-steepening,

similarly to the solution of the inviscid Burgers equation [2]. This solution may also be

obtained by directly assuming that h can be written as a function of u. Note that there are

no steady state solutions within this system, since the dispersion is absent; but by including
the electron inertial eﬀect in Eq. (10) this could be achieved on length scales <
∼

where ωpe is the electron plasma frequency. The dispersive eﬀects break the ρ = h relation,

λe = c/ωpe,

and produce an asymmetry between the density and magnetic ﬁeld perturbations.

We have analyzed the system (11)–(12) numerically. As an initial condition, we took the

magnetic ﬁeld h = 1 + 0.5 sech(x/20), describing a localized magnetic ﬁeld (and density)

compression of the plasma. As we are interested in the evolution and creation of a “shocklet”

moving in one direction, we choose the initial condition for the velocity u from Eq. (18),

describing a wave moving in the positive x–direction only. The evolution of the system for a

low-beta (β = 0) and for a high-beta (β = 10) plasma is displayed in Figs. 1 and 2, respec-

tively. In agreement with the analytical prediction, the initial wave is propagating in the

positive x–direction only. Figure 1 shows that both the magnetic and velocity perturbations

steepen and a shock front starts to develop. For the high-beta plasma case, as displayed in

Fig. 2, the velocity associated with the shocklet is larger, and the self-steepening develops

faster than for the low-beta plasma case. When the shock fronts become steep enough, ef-

fects such as the electron inertia and electron Landau damping (which heats the plasma) will

become important. Dispersive eﬀects also occur if the waves propagate with some angle to

the magnetic ﬁeld direction. The combined eﬀects of dispersion and wave-particle induced

dissipation could explain the apparent phase asymmetry between the magnetic ﬁeld and

density perturbations, as observed in large-amplitude FMS shocklets [5]. This asymmetry

is likely to appear after the shocklets have developed due to the self-steepening of the FMS

waves, as investigated here.

To summarize, we have considered the nonlinear propagation of FMS waves in a hot

magnetoplasma. It has been shown that the nonlinear MHD equations in a ﬁnite-β plasma

can be reduced to a pair of equations in which the ion ﬂuid velocity and the compressional

magnetic ﬁeld are nonlinearly coupled. The system has been diagonalized and special, single

wave solutions have been obtained. The solutions represent the spatio-temporal evolution of

an arbitrary amplitude FMS waves. The equations for the full system are solved numerically

to show the formation of FMS shocklets, in full agreement with the analytic results. The

ﬁnite plasma beta has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the shocklet proﬁle in that the shocks develop

on a much shorter timescale than for the the plasma with a low beta. In conclusion, the

present results qualitatively account for the salient features of the observed FMS shocklets

at the Earth’s bow shock [5].

Space charge limited 2-d electron ﬂow between two ﬂat electrodes in a strong
magnetic ﬁeld

An approximate analytic solution is constructed for the 2-d space charge limited emission by a
cathode surrounded by non emitting conducting ledges of width Λ. An essentially exact solution
(via conformal mapping) of the electrostatic problem in vacuum is matched to the solution of a
linearized problem in the space charge region whose boundaries are sharp due to the presence of a
strong magnetic ﬁeld. The current density growth in a narrow interval near the edges of the cathode
depends strongly on Λ. We obtain an empirical formula for the total current as a function of Λ
which extends to more general cathode geometries.

The study of space charge limited (SCL) current, ini-
tiated in the beginning of the last century [1,2], contin-
ues to be of great current interest [3-9]. These works
are important for the design of high power diodes, tech-
niques of charged particles beams, physics of non-neutral
plasmas including plasma sheath, and other numerous
applications. The modelling of SCL ionic ﬂow in cylin-
drical and spherical geometry [3] is also necessary for the
inertial-electrostatic conﬁnement of fusion plasmas. Un-
fortunately only the planar 1-d case permits an analytic
solution [1,2] and as pointed out in a recent review [5]
even “the seeming simple problem of 2-d planar emission
remains unresolved”. This motivated the present work
which provides a semi-analytical solution for a prototype
2-d model similar to that studied in [6]. We obtain for
the ﬁrst time, we believe, a reasonable analytic approx-
imation for the currents at the edge of the cathode - an
important (though usually undesirable) feature of SCL
diodes [6,7]. An extension of our methods should facili-
tate dealing with this problem to any desirable accuracy
thus providing an alternative to PIC simulations.

Model. We consider the current between two conduct-
ing ﬂat electrodes where the anode, whose potential is V ,
is an inﬁnite plane separated by a distance D from the
grounded cathode which is an inﬁnitely long strip paral-
lel to the anode. Our assumptions are: 1) The cathode
upper surface, of width 2A, has inﬁnite emissivity while
the lower face and the ledges of widths Λ do not emit (see
Fig.1). 2) A very strong strong magnetic ﬁeld perpendic-
ular to the electrodes inhibits the transversal components
of electron velocities [6,8], but almost does not aﬀect the
total current [6,8,9]. 3) The emitted electrons leave the
cathode with zero velocity [1,2,6].

If the cathode is in the (X, Z) plane and the mag-
netic ﬁeld in the Y -direction the velocities v of electrons
are parallel to the Y -axis with mv2(X, Y ) = 2eU (X, Y ),

where U (X, Y ) represents the potential ﬁeld while m, e
are the electron mass and charge. The current density
J(X), which clearly is Y -independent, determines to-

functions φ(x, y) and j(x) which are non-negative and
symmetric about the y-axis. To do this we ﬁrst solve
eq.(2) approximately in the current region Q on a rather
intuitive level. The problem is nonlinear here and it is
not well posed if one disregards the ﬁeld at

sequently our solution will have a set of free parameters

used as the BC and we obtain a Dirichlet problem for
the Laplace eq.(2) in the outer region of the half-plane

and use also a stronger assumption that the diﬀerence
1 is small almost everywhere (i.e. it does
φ(x, y)/φ1(y)
not exceed
1.5 even near the edges of region). This
diﬀerence however is not small at the cathode edges,
x =

outside. The large gradients in the ﬁeld lead to the ac-
celeration of electrons and thus to a strong rise of the
current density j(x) near the boundary of the SCL ﬂow.

an exact equality because of the approximations made.

We minimize the least square divergence from zero of
the expression (19) on the interval 0.15 < y < 0.85 with-
out approaching the endpoints where our treatment is
not entirely adequate. A standard procedure yields a set
of linear algebraic equations for ql. We did not go further
than lmax = 10. After the ql are computed one can ﬁnd
the current density (6) and the parameter α (13).

The accuracy of this method can be evaluated to some
degree by determining the relative average discrepancy
∆ of electric ﬁelds at the boundary of the space charge
region Q on the chosen interval of y. The results of our
computations are shown in the Table 1, where for diﬀer-
ent values of the ledge λ one can see also α(λ), parameters
a), and the relative height
ql, µmax (near y = 0 and x =

a. When
we extend the interval of matching the electric ﬁelds up
to (0.01, 0.99) the quantities in the table stay approxi-
mately the same, only ∆ increases. This conﬁrms the
general validity of our method and simultaneously

shows that the computation of electric ﬁelds near the
corners of the rectangle Q is not very good. In particular,
in the worst case (the most severe cathode regime, see
also [6,7,12]) when λ = 0, the electric ﬁeld is singular at
the cathode edges. The computation becomes unstable,
we cannot therefore the data of Table 1 to be accurate
there when the linearization fails too.

When l runs from 1 to 10 the values of ql decrease
approximately by a factor 20-50. Therefore α is evaluated
very well by (13) where the kl increase from
4 to 32.
The accuracy of j(x) and µ(x) might be improved if one
truncates (9) at a larger lmax though we would not expect
dramatic changes. The cases λ =
(when the mapping
is exact) and λ = 1 are very close which means that
the parameter α(a, λ) as well as ql are approximately
independent of a when a > 1. Keeping the exponential
terms in µ(x, y) in the matching conditions (20) does not
complicate the calculation and it will give

only insigniﬁcant corrections. The current density j(x)
at x = 0 increases in this case by about 2q1e−3.9a. If a
is smaller, but 2λ + 2a > 1, the scheme of computation
is the same though the ql become functions of a and one
cannot decrease a too much because the ﬁrst term in (9)
needs corrections.

An important part of our analysis is the form (11) of
fl(x) which implies that the current density (10) in a
narrow region of width
1 (D in the original units) at
the cathode edges has a sharp peak which decays faster

c2, c3 − c3 and c4 correspond to 2a = 8, 4, 2, 1 respectively.

We can compare our curve c3 for a = 1 with PIC sim-
ulations presented in [7]. There for zero cathode recess
(dx = 0), A = 50 mm, and unfortunately unspeciﬁed
width of the shroud a reasonable ﬁt would be jmax = 3.9
in our Table for λ = 0.1 versus 3.2 in [7]. We get the
half-width of the current density peak
1.2 mm while
in [7] it was 1 mm. Our magnetic ﬁeld is stronger and
we think also that PIC simulations with ﬁner grids are
closer to our computation, but diverge from experimental
results because the real cathodes with their ﬁnite thick-
ness and roundness do not have the very strong electric
ﬁeld intensities present however in the models.

Generalization. We expect that this pattern of narrow
wings of the current density holds also for ﬁnite ﬂat cath-
odes with perimeter P where the boundary region will
have an area

on the curvature and return back to the original units.

In the general case of a cathode with area S
total current can be written as the sum I = SJ1 + P D ˜J.
The ”edge” current ˜J, which is assumed here to be inde-
pendent of geometry, can be viewed as distributed over
the edges of the cathode of width equal to the distance
between the electrodes. The ratio ˜J/J1 can be evaluated
in terms of the parameter α deﬁned in (13). Comparing
¯J = I/S = J1(1 + ˜JP D/J1S) with eq.(12) for our geom-
etry, where ¯J = J2, S = 2AL and P = 2L (the length L
of the cathode segment is arbitrary), we have ˜J = J1α/2

Conclusions. 1) The current wings, Fig.3, resemble
simulated ones [6,7,12]. They are high when the width of
ledges λ is small and the vacuum electric ﬁeld near the
cathode edges is strong. Their form becomes practicaly
constant when the ledges are wider than the distance D
between electrodes. 2) The shape of the current wings,
which is determined by eigenvalues kl of (8), is roughly
exponential and the 1-d current is restored up to a few
percents at the distance D from the edges. 3) The param-
eter α, which deﬁnes the net current density, depends on
the width of ledges. An approximate empirical formula

agrees with the data in Table 1 within
3.3%. (For a
diﬀerent model with the constant current density α was
estimated in [8] as close to 0.31.) 4) Our techniques of
matching the electric ﬁelds at the boundary of the space
charge region and using rather modest variations of the
potential in the x direction is eﬀective for approximate
modelling the 2-d and 3-d ﬂows of charged particles.

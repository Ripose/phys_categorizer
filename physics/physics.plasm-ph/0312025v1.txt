1 Problem

All electrostatic ﬁelds E (i.e., ones with no time dependence) can be derived from a scalar
potential V (E = −∇V ) and hence obey ∇ × E = 0. The latter condition is sometimes
considered to be a requirement for electrostatic ﬁelds. Show, however, that there can ex-
ist time-dependent electric ﬁelds for which ∇ × E = 0, which have been given the name
“electrostatic waves”.

In particular, show that a plane wave with electric ﬁeld E parallel to the wave vector k
(a longitudinal wave) can exist in a medium with no time-dependent magnetic ﬁeld if the
electric displacement D is zero. This cannot occur in an ordinary dielectric medium, but
can happen in a plasma. (Time-independent electric and magnetic ﬁelds could, of course,
be superimposed on the wave ﬁeld.) Compare the potentials for the “electrostatic wave” in
the Coulomb and Lorentz gauges. Discuss energy density and ﬂow for such a wave.

Deduce the frequency ω of the longitudinal wave in a hot, collisionless plasma that
propagates transversely to a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld B0 in terms of the (electron)
cyclotron frequency,

(in Gaussian units), the (electron) plasma frequency,

ωB =

and the electron temperature T , where e > 0 and m are the charge and mass of the electron,
c is the speed of light, and N is the electron number density.

For a simpliﬁed analysis, you may assume that the positive ions are at rest, that all
2KT /m, where K is Boltzmann’s con-
electrons have the same transverse velocity v⊥ =
stant, T is the temperature, and that the densities of the ions and unperturbed electrons are
uniform. Then the discussion may proceed from an (approximate) analysis of the motion of
an individual electron to the resulting polarization density and dielectric constant, etc.

q

Such waves are called electron Bernstein waves, following their prediction via an analysis
based on the Boltzmann transport equation [1]. Bernstein waves were ﬁrst produced in
laboratory plasmas in 1964 [2], following possible detection in the ionosphere in 1963. They
are now being applied in plasma diagnostics where it is desired to propagate waves below
the plasma frequency [3].

2 Solution

2.1 General Remarks

We ﬁrst verify that Maxwell’s equations imply that when an electric ﬁeld E has no time
dependence, then ∇ × E = 0.

If ∂E/∂t = 0, then the magnetic ﬁeld B obeys ∂2B/∂t2 = 0, as follows on taking the
time derivative of Faraday’s law, c∇ × E = −∂B/∂t in Gaussian units. In principle, this
is consistent with a magnetic ﬁeld that varies linearly with time, B(r, t) = B0(r) + B1(r)t.
However, this leads to arbitrarily large magnetic ﬁelds at early and late times, and is excluded
on physical grounds. Hence, ∂E/∂t = 0 implies that ∂B/∂t = 0 also, and ∇ × E = 0
according to Faraday’s law.

We next consider some general properties of a longitudinal plane electric wave, taken to

have the form

E = Ex ˆxei(kx−ωt).

This obeys ∇ × E = 0, and so can be derived from an electric potential, namely

The electric wave (3) has no associated magnetic wave, since Faraday’s law tells us that

E = −∇V

where

V = i

Ex

ei(kx−ωt).

0 = ∇ × E = −

and any magnetic ﬁeld in the problem must be static.

It is well known that electromagnetic waves in vacuum are transverse. A longitudinal
electric wave can only exist in a medium that can support a nonzero polarization density P
(volume density of electric dipole moments). The polarization density implies an eﬀective
charge density ρ given by

which is consistent with the ﬁrst Maxwell equation,

only if

ρ = −∇ · P

∇ · E = 4πρ,

P = −

E
4π

,

D = E + 4πP = 0.

in which case the electric displacement D of the longitudinal wave vanishes,

Hence, the (relative) dielectric constant ǫ also vanishes

Strictly speaking, eq. (8) could read P = −E/4π + P′, for any ﬁeld P′ that obeys
∇ · P′ = 0. However, since any magnetic ﬁeld in the problem is static, the fourth Maxwell
equation tells us that

has no time dependence. Recalling that the polarization current is related by

J =

∂P
∂t

,

we again ﬁnd relation (8) with the possible addition of a static ﬁeld P′ that is associated
with a truly electrostatic ﬁeld E′. In sum, a longitudinal electric wave described by eqs. (3),
(8) and (9) can coexist with background electrostatic and magnetostatic ﬁelds of the usual
type.

Maxwell’s equations alone provide no relation between the wave number k and the wave
frequency ω of the longitudinal wave, and hence the wave phase velocity ω/k is arbitrary.
This suggests that purely longitudinal electric waves are best considered as limiting cases of
more general waves, for which additional physical relations provide additional information
as to the character of the waves.

2.2 Gauge Invariance

Since the electric wave (3) has no associated magnetic ﬁeld, we can deﬁne its vector potential
A to be zero, which is certainly consistent with the Coulomb gauge condition ∇ · A = 0.
Suppose, however, we prefer to work in the Lorentz gauge, for which

∇ · A = −

.

Then, the vector potential will be nonzero, and the electric ﬁeld is related by

Clearly the potentials have the forms

A = Axˆxei(kx−ωt),

which are consistent with B = ∇ × A = 0. From the Lorentz gauge condition (12) we have

We could also derive the wave (3) from the potentials

Thus, an “electrostatic wave” is not necessarily associated with an “electrostatic” scalar

potential.

2.3 Energy Considerations

A common expression for the electric ﬁeld energy density is E · D/8π. However, this vanishes
for longitudinal electric waves, according to eq. (9). Further, since the longitudinal electric
wave can exist with zero magnetic ﬁeld, there is no Poynting vector S = (c/4π)E × H or
momentum density pﬁeld = D × B/4πc, according to the usual prescriptions.

Let us recall the origins of the standard lore. Namely, the rate of work done by the ﬁeld

E on current density J is

J · E =

· E = −

· E = −

∂P
∂t

4π

∂E

using eqs. (8) and (11). This work is done at the expense of the electric ﬁeld energy density
uﬁeld, which we therefore identify as

uﬁeld =

E2
8π

=

E2
x

cos2(kx − ωt),

for the longitudinal wave (3). We readily interpret this energy density as moving in the +x
direction at the phase velocity vp = ω/k, even though the derivation of eq. (19) did not lead
to a Poynting vector.

We should also note that energy is stored in the medium in the form of kinetic energy of

the electrons (and, in general, ions as well) that contribute to the polarization,

P = Ne(x − x0) = −

E
4π

.

Thus, the velocity of an electron is given by

v = v0 −

= v0 −

sin(kx − ωt).

˙E

ωExˆx

In squaring this to get the kinetic energy, we neglect the term in v0 · ˆx, assuming its average
to be zero as holds for a medium that is at rest on average (and also holds for a plasma in
a tokamak when x is taken as the radial coordinate in a small volume). Then, we ﬁnd the
mechanical energy density to be

where ωP is the (electron) plasma frequency (2). We again can interpret the additional term
as an energy density that ﬂows in the +x direction at the phase velocity.

If the wave frequency is less than the plasma frequency, as is the case for examples of
Bernstein waves discussed in the sec. 2.5, the longitudinal electric ﬁeld energy density is
larger than that of the mechanical energy density of the wave.

2.4 Longitudinal Waves in a Cold, Unmagnetized Plasma

As a preliminary exercise we consider the case of a longitudinal wave,

E = Exˆx cos(kx − ωt),

in a cold, unmagnetized plasma. An electron at x0 in the absence of the wave has coordinate
x = x0 + δx when in the wave, where only the x component of the equation of motion is
nontrivial:

mδ¨x = −eEx cos(kx − ωt) ≈ −eEx cos(kx0 − ωt).

The approximation in eq. (26) is that the oscillations are small. Then we ﬁnd,

For a longitudinal wave, the electric displacement must vanish according to eq. (9), so

That is, the frequency of longitudinal electric waves can only be the plasma frequency in a
cold, unmagnetized plasma.

2.5 Longitudinal Waves in a Hot, Magnetized Plasma

Turning now to the problem of plane waves in a magnetized plasma, we consider waves
whose propagation vector k is transverse to the external magnetic ﬁeld B0, and seek a
solution where electric ﬁeld vector E is parallel to k.

We adopt a rectangular coordinate system in which the external magnetic ﬁeld B0 is

along the +z axis and the plane electric wave propagates along the +x axis:

The unperturbed (E = 0) motion of an electron is on a helix of radius

E = Exˆx cos(kx − ωt).

noting that the circular motion of a negatively charged electron is counterclockwise in the x-y
plane for an external magnetic ﬁeld along the +z axis. For an electron in the collisionless
plasma, we consider the Lorentz force only from the wave electric ﬁeld and the external
magnetic ﬁeld, −e(E + v/c × B0). The equations of motion are then

m[−ω2rB cos(ωBt + φ0) + δ¨x] = −eEx cos(kx − ωt) −

δ¨y − ωBδ ˙x = 0,

δ ˙y = ωBδx.

To proceed, we must expand the factor cos(kx − ωt), which we do as follows:

cos(kx − ωt) = cos(kx0 − ωt + krB cos(ωBt + φ0) + kδx)

≈ cos(kx0 − ωt + krB cos(ωBt + φ0))
≈ cos(kx0 − ωt) cos(krB cos(ωBt + φ0)) − krB cos(ωBt + φ0) sin(kx0 − ωt)

In the above we have supposed that δx ≪ rB in going from the ﬁrst line to the second, that
rB ≪ x0 in going from the second line to the third, that krB ≪ 1 and hcos(ωBt + φ0) sin(kx0 − ωt)i
= 0 in going from the third line to the fourth, and that hcos2(ωBt + φ0)i = 1/2 in going from
the fourth line to the ﬁfth. Perhaps the most doubtful assumption is that krB ≪ 1.

This result corresponds to keeping only the ﬁrst term of Bernstein’s series expansion, eq. (50)
of [1].

In the limit of a cold plasma, where v⊥ = 0, the frequency of the longitudinal wave is
B + ω2
ω2
P , which is the so-called upper hybrid resonance frequency. (This result is well-

known to follow from the assumption of a cold plasma.)
q

In our model, the eﬀect of nonzero temperature is to lower the frequency of the longitu-
dinal wave, bringing it closer to the cyclotron frequency, ωB. The eﬀect is greater for shorter
wavelengths (larger wave number k). Our approximation implies that for wavelengths small
compared to r⊥, the characteristic radius of the electron cyclotron motion at temperature T ,
the frequency of the wave approaches zero. However, our approximation becomes doubtful
for kr⊥ ≫ 1. Bernstein ﬁnds that the wave frequency is restricted to a band around ωB,
which result is only hinted at by our analysis.

If we evaluate the dispersion relation (47) at the cyclotron frequency, ω = ωB, then we

ﬁnd the following representative values for parameters of a Bernstein wave:

k =

While our analysis does not constrain the phase velocity, vp = ω/k, of the longitudinal

wave, we do ﬁnd a relation between vp and the group velocity, vg = dω/dk:

(51)

The longitudinal electric waves are negative group velocity waves! We have written elsewhere
on a paradox associated with this latter phenomenon [4], where we found that a negative
group velocity can have any magnitude without contradicting the insight of Einstein that
signals must propagate at velocities less than or equal to c. Hence, the lack of a constraint
on vp is not a fundamental ﬂaw in the analysis.

The author thanks Brent Jones for bringing this problem to his attention. For a related

discussion of magnetostatic waves, see [5].

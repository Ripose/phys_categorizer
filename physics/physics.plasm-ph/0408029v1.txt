Abstract

Test particle transport determined by the Lorentz force in turbulent mag-
netized plasmas is studied. The time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient, valid
for the whole range of parameters, is obtained by developing the decorrela-
tion trajectory method. The eﬀects of Larmor gyration in the presence of
trapping are analyzed and several transport regimes are evidenced.

Keywords: plasma turbulence, statistical approaches, test particle transport

1 Introduction

Impurity control in magnetically conﬁned plasmas is a very important issue for the
development of fusion reactors. Impurity behaviour is a complex problem related to
conﬁnement and transport of the bulk ions and electrons in plasma and to plasma-
wall interaction. A very strong experimental eﬀort (see e.g.
[1]-[9]) lead to the
conclusion that this process is far from being understood on the basis of the ex-
isting theoretical models. In particular, the experimental results for the diﬀusion
coeﬃcients are much larger than the neoclassical prediction, especially in the edge
plasma, showing the presence of anomalous transport.

We analyze here the particular topic of impurity transport in turbulent plasmas
using test particle approach. Particle motion in a stochastic potential was exten-
sively studied in the guiding center approximation [10]-[15]. It is well known since
many years [16] that, for slowly varying or large amplitude turbulence, the E × B
drift determines a process of dynamical trapping of the trajectories. It consists of
trajectory winding around the extrema of the stochastic potential and strongly in-
ﬂuences the transport. Important progresses in the study of this nonlinear process
were recently obtained. New statistical methods were developed [17], [18] that per-
mitted to determine the asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient and also the correlation of
the Lagrangian velocity and the time dependent (running) diﬀusion coeﬃcient. It
was shown that the trapping process determines the decrease of the diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient and the change of its scaling in the parameters of the stochastic ﬁeld. These
methods were extended to more complex models, which consider, besides the E × B

1

drift, particle collisions [19], an average velocity [20] or the parallel motion [21], and
also to the study of the collisional particle diﬀusion in stochastic magnetic ﬁelds
[22]. The conclusion of these studies is that the trapping combined with a decor-
relation mechanism determines anomalous transport regimes. In these regimes the
dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D on the parameters describing the decor-
relation is inverted due to trapping in the sense that a decrease of D appearing
in the quasilinear regime is transformed into an ”anomalous” increase of D in the
nonlinear regime [23].

All these studies are based on the guiding center approximation for particle
motion that considers the Larmor radius negligible. This approximation is not
adequate for the impurity ions which can have Larmor radii comparable or larger
than the correlation length of the turbulence and cyclotron periods comparable with
the turnover time of the E×B motion. In these conditions the trajectories have to be
determined from the Lorentz force. The aim of this paper is to determine the eﬀects
of ﬁnite Larmor radius on particle transport in a turbulent magnetized plasmas.
In particular, we analyze the inﬂuence on the trapping process and compare the
characteristics of the transport induced by the Lorentz force (Lorentz transport)
with those obtained in the guiding center approximation (drift transport). The time
dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient is obtained as a function of the turbulence and ion’s
parameters by extending the decorrelation trajectory method developed for the drift
transport [17], [24]. The transport regimes for a large range of parameters are
determined.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the basic equations, the
statistical approach and the derivation of the general expression for the time de-
pendent diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The results are presented in Sections 3-6. First, in
Section 3, a static potential is considered. We show that the trapping exists even at
large values of the Larmor radius and that it determines a subdiﬀusive transport, as
in the drift approximation, but with a time dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
strongly inﬂuenced by the gyration motion. Then we examine the dependence of the
asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient on the three dimensionless parameters (see Section 2
for their deﬁnitions) that characterize this process and show that several transport
regimes appear. The dependence on the ﬁrst parameter (the Kubo number) that
describes the eﬀect of the time dependence of the stochastic potential is analyzed
in Section 4 where two regimes are evidenced. The dependence of D on the initial
kinetic energy of the ions (the second parameter) is presented in Section 5 and in
Section 6 the eﬀect of the normalized cyclotron frequency that essentially describes
the speciﬁc charge of the ions is examined. The conclusions are summarized in
Section 7.

2 Basic equations and statistical approach

We consider a constant conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld directed along z axis, B = Bez (slab
geometry) and an electrostatic turbulence represented by an electrostatic potential
φ,(x, t), where x ≡ (x1, x2) are the Cartesian coordinates in the plane perpendicular
to B. The motion of an ion with charge q and mass m is determined by the Lorentz

force:

d2x(t)
dt2 = q {−∇φ,(x, t) + u × B}
where x(t) is the ion trajectory, u(t) = dx(t)/dt is its velocity and ∇ is the gradient
in the (x1, x2) plane. The initial conditions are

This equation is transformed into a system of ﬁrst order equations for the position
and the velocity of the ion

The electrostatic potential φ(x, t) is a stochastic ﬁeld and thus Eqs. (6-7) are
Langevin equations. The solution consists, in principle, in determining the statis-
tical properties of the ensembles of trajectories, each one obtained by integrating
Eqs. (6-7) for a realization of the stochastic potential. We will determine here the
mean square displacement and the time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the guid-
ing center trajectories ξ(t). These statistical quantities can also be determined for
particle trajectories x(t) and for the Larmor radius ρ(t) but they are not physically
relevant.

The potential is considered to be a stationary and homogeneous Gaussian stochas-
tic ﬁeld, with zero average. Such a stochastic ﬁeld is completely determined by the
two-point Eulerian correlation function, E(x, t), deﬁned by

E(x, t) ≡ hφ(x,, t,) φ(x, + x, t, + t)i .

The average h...i is the statistical average over the realizations of φ(x, t). The sta-
tistical properties of the drift velocity components

tions of the drift velocity components, Eij(x, t) ≡

the potential-velocity correlations, Eφi(x, t) ≡

The Eulerian correlation of the drift velocity (10) evidences three parameters: the
E11(0, 0), the correlation time τ c, which is the decay time of the
amplitude V =
Eulerian correlation, and the correlation length λc, which is the characteristic decay
distance. These parameters combine in a dimensionless Kubo number

p

which is the ratio of τ c to the average time of ﬂight of the particles (τ f l = λc/V )
over the correlation length. Using these parameters of the stochastic ﬁeld, Eqs.(6-7)

where the normalization parameters are τ f l for time, λc for distances, V for the drift

The same notations are kept for the normalized quantities.

We note that the equation for the guiding center trajectory (12) is similar with
that obtained in the guiding center approximation, with the diﬀerence that the
argument of the potential is the particle trajectory x(t) ≡ ξ(t)+ρ(t) instead of ξ(t).
The equation for the Larmor radius (13) describes a cyclotron motion that has the
radius and the frequency dependent of the stochastic potential. In the 2-dimensional
case studied here, both equations are of Hamiltonian type (the two components of
ξ(t) are conjugated variables as well as the two components of the Larmor radius

variable introduces a time dependence in H(ξ, ρ) which perturbs the regular motion
that is obtained in the absence of interaction. The perturbation can be very strong
leading to a chaotic motion of the guiding centers.

Particle motion is thus determined by three dimensionless parameters: K, ρ and
Ω. The ﬁrst one, the Kubo number K, does not appear in the equations, but only in
the statistical description of the stochastic potential. It describes the eﬀect of time
variation of the stochastic potential. The second parameter ρ is the initial Larmor
radius normalized with the correlation length and appears in the initial condition
(2), which is written as

ρ1(0) = ρ cos(α),

ρ2(0) = ρ sin(α),

ξ(0) = −ρ(0)

(17)

where ρ = |ρ(0)|
λc = |u0| /V Ω and α determines the orientation of the initial velocity
(the angle between u0 and the x1 axis is π/2 − α). ρ is related to the initial kinetic
energy of the particles. The third parameter Ω deﬁned in Eq.(14) is the cyclotron
frequency normalized with τ f l and describes the relative importance of the cyclotron
and drift motion (second and respectively ﬁrst term in 13)) in the evolution of the
Larmor radius.

Starting from the statistical description of the stochastic potential, we will de-

termine the correlation of the Lagrangian drift velocity, deﬁned by:

provided that the process is stationary [25].

The guiding center approximation obtained by taking ρ = 0 in Eq.(12) was re-
cently studied by developing a semi-analytical approach, the decorrelation trajectory
method, [17], [24]. Using this approach an important progress was obtained in the
understanding of the intrinsic trapping process speciﬁc to the E × B drift. We
present here a generalization of the decorrelation trajectory method that applies to
the Lorentz transport described by Eqs. (12-13).

The Langevin equations (12-13) for given values of the parameters Ω, ρ and
K is studied in subensembles (S) of realizations of the stochastic ﬁeld, which are
determined by given values of the potential and of the drift velocity in the starting
point of the trajectories:

φ(0, 0) = φ0, vdr(0, 0) = v0.

(21)

All the trajectories contained in a subensemble have the same initial energy. The
stochastic (Eulerian) potential and drift velocity in a subensemble (S) deﬁned by
condition (21) are Gaussian ﬁelds but non-stationary and non-homogeneous, with

the subensemble and are determined by the Eulerian correlation of the potential

where h...iS is the statistical average aver the realizations that belong to (S). They
are equal to the corresponding imposed condition (21) in x = 0 and t = 0 and decay
to zero at large distance and/or time. The existence of an average Eulerian drift ve-
locity in the subensemble determines an average motion, i.e. an average Lagrangian
drift velocity VL(t; S) ≡
S . The correlation of the Lagrangian drift
velocity for the whole ensemble of realizations (18) can be written as

where P1(φ0, v0; 0, 0) is the probability that a realization belongs to the subensemble
(S). The average Lagrangian drift velocity VL(t; S) is determined using an approx-
imation that essentially consists in neglecting the ﬂuctuations of the trajectories in
(S). This approximation is validated in [18] where the ﬂuctuations of the trajectories
in (S) are taken into account in a more complicated and precise method. It is shown
that they lead to a weak modiﬁcation of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(t), although
they strongly change VL(t; S). Introducing the average guiding center trajectory in
(S), Ξ(t; S) ≡ hξ(t)iS , and the average Larmor radius in (S), Π(t; S) ≡ hρ(t)iS , the
equations of motion can be averaged over the realizations in (S) in this approxima-
tion and yield

Since the orientation of the initial velocity u0 is arbitrary, we will consider in each
realization in (S) initial conditions with uniform distribution of α over the interval
[0, 2π).

This approximation ensures the conservation of the subensemble average energy

of the particles.

Considering for simplicity an isotropic stochastic potential with the Eulerian cor-
relation depending |x| , a diagonal correlation tensor is obtained for the Lagrangian
drift velocity, Lij(t) = δijL(t), and the following expressions for the time dependent
(running) diﬀusive coeﬃcient:

(30)
and Ξ1(t; S) is the component of the solution of Eqs.(25-26) along the initial average
drift velocity v0 and v = |v0| .

We have thus determined the correlation of the Lagrangian drift velocity (for
ions with mass m, charge q and given initial kinetic energy) corresponding to given
Eulerian correlation E(x, t) of the stochastic potential. Explicit results for L(t) and
D(t) are obtained by eﬀectively calculating the average trajectories in (S), solutions
of Eqs.
(25-27), and the weighted average (30). This procedure appears to be
very similar with a direct numerical study of the simulated trajectories. There are
however essential diﬀerences. The average trajectories are obtained for a rather
smooth and simple potential and the number of trajectories is much smaller than
in the numerical study due to the weighting factor determined analytically. This
reduced very much the calculation time, such that it can be performed on PC. A
compuder code is developed for explicit calculation of D(t) for given values of the
parameters K, ρ, Ω and prescribed Eulerian correlation of the potential.

The results presented in next sections are for E(x, t) = 1/(1 + x2/2) exp(−t/K).
As shown in [24] the shape of the Eulerian correlation of the potential determines the
strength of the trapping represented by the exponent of the time decay of the diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient in the static case. However the general behavior of the decorrelation
trajectories and of L(t) and D(t) are the same for all correlations.

3 Transport by Lorentz force

We consider here a static potential (K, τ c → ∞) and compare the results with those
obtained in the guiding center approximation (drift transport) [17], [24]. The aim
is to identify the eﬀects of the Larmor radius.

In the frame of the decorrelation trajectory method, the diﬀerence between the
Lorentz and the drift transport consists in the equations for the decorrelation tra-
jectories. The trajectories obtained from Eqs. (25-26) are much complicated than in
the guiding center approximation. The important simpliﬁcation introduced in the
latter case that actually reduces the number of parameters at one and eliminates
the time dependence of the stochastic potential (see [17], [24]) cannot be applied in
the present case. The trajectories eﬀectively depend on the six parameters α, u, φ0,
Ω, ρ and K. In the static case there are closed periodic trajectories of the guiding
center ξ(t), even at large Larmor radii which shows that trapping exists. The initial
drift velocity does not inﬂuence only the period but also the size and the shape of
the paths. The orientation of the initial velocity of the particle, α, strongly inﬂu-
ences the trajectories obtained with the initial condition (27) because the average
produced by the gyration is diﬀerent for diﬀerent values of α.

Figure 1: The contour plot of the function f (φ0, t) for the drift (a) and Lorentz (b)
transport.

The function F (t) in Eq. (30) is obtained by summing the contribution, f (φ0, t),
of all the decorrelation trajectories that start from a point where the potential is
φ0. This function f (φ0, t) gives details of the diﬀusion process showing the trapping.
The contour plot of this function is represented in Fig. 1.a. for the drift transport
and in Fig. 1.b. for the Lorentz transport. One can see that in the ﬁrst case the
are eliminated progressively due to trapping
contributions of the large values of
and f (φ0, t) shrinks continuously as time increase such that thinner and thinner
intervals of φ0 centered around zero contribute to D(t). The Lorentz transport is
characterized by a completely diﬀerent pattern for this function (Fig. 1.b). At
small time it has a Gaussian shape that increase up to a maximum. This increase
is not smooth but performed in steps. At later times, f becomes unsymmetrical
and has a minimum at φ0 = 0. It decays continuously in time maintaining a large
range of φ0. Thus, the trapping process is completely diﬀerent for the Lorentz

transport. At each value of φ0 in a large interval, the cyclotron motion determines
large, open trajectories as well as small, closed ones, depending on the values of α
and v. The contributions of small trajectories are progressively eliminated by mixing
determining the decay of the function f (φ0, t).

The time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient is presented in Fig. 2 for the Lorentz
transport (continuous line) and for the drift transport (dashed line). The time
dependence of the Lorentz diﬀusion coeﬃcient is rather complex and a strong inﬂu-
ence of the Larmor radius can be observed. At small time the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
increases nonuniformly, in steps. Averaging these steps a linear time dependence
can be observed, similar with that obtained in the drift transport. This behavior
extends to times much longer than the ﬂight time. The maximum of D(t) is at
about 7τ f l. At later times a decay of D(t) appears with a time dependence that is
approximately the same as in the drift case, but with D(t) larger with a factor of
about 2. Thus the transport in the static case is subdiﬀusive.

(blue line) and for the drift transport (dashed line) for Ω = 10, ρ = 1, K = ∞.

A clear story of the physical process can be deduced from the time evolution
of D(t) and L(t). Starting from t = 0, at very small time (t ≪ T ) D(t) is equal
with the drift diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Then, the cyclotron motion with a large Larmor
radius ( ρ = 1 in Figs. 2, 3) averages the stochastic ﬁeld along the trajectory.
Consequently the guiding center has a very small displacement and D(t) is much
reduced compared to the drift case. After a period the trajectories come back near
the initial position (all in phase because T is a constant), a coherent motion of
the guiding centers appears during the passage of the particles and a step in D(t)
is produced. Thus the evolution of the guiding centers is determined mainly by
short coherent kicks appearing with period T. Their displacement is thus slower.
Consequently, the trapping appears at later time and the linear increase of D(t)
extends to longer times leading to values of D(t) that are higher than for the drift
diﬀusion. When the displacements of the guiding centers increase the coherence of
the periodic kicks is progressively lost and the peaks of L(t) becomes smaller and
thicker.

The diﬀusion coeﬃcient obtained for the Lorentz transport is a function of the
dimensionless parameters K, ρ and Ω. They contain the physical parameters of the
stochastic ﬁeld (amplitude, correlation length, correlation time) and of the impurity
ions (mass, charge, kinetic energy). The dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient on
these parameters is analyzed in the next Sections.

4 K dependence

We consider here time dependent stochastic potentials and determine the depen-
dence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient on the parameter K deﬁned in Eq. (11).

In the case of drift transport, a change of variable can be done in the equation for
the decorrelation trajectories in order to introduce the time factor of the Eulerian
correlation of the potential in the time variable. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the time
dependent potential is so determined from D(t) obtained for the static potential with

10

the same space dependence in the Eulerian correlation [24]. The equations for the
decorrelation trajectories (25-26) obtained for the Lorentz transport do not have
this property: due to the cyclotron motion (second term in Eq. (26)), the time
factor in the average potential Φ cannot be introduced in the time variable. Thus
the K dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient must be determined by performing the
calculations of D(t) for each value of K.

Figure 4: The evolution of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the Lorentz transport in a
time dependent stochastic potentia (red line) compared to the results obtained in a
static potential for Lorentz transport (blue line) and for the drift transport
(dashed line).

However, we have shown in [18], using general considerations based on the shape
of the correlation of the Lagrangian velocity, that at large K the asymptotic diﬀusion
coeﬃcient can be approximated by the diﬀusion coeﬃcient determined for the static
potential at t = τ c, (or in dimensionless units at t = K). These considerations are not
dependent on the speciﬁc type of motion or on the statistical method used to obtain

11

the Lagrangian correlation. We examine here the accuracy of this approximation
for the Lorentz transport.

Typical examples for the evolution of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in time dependent
stochastic ﬁelds are presented in Fig. 4 (continuous line) compared to D(t) obtained
in the static potential for Lorentz (dotted line) and drift (dashed line) transport.
One can see that the diﬀusion coeﬃcient saturates showing that the transport is
diﬀusive in time dependent stochastic potentials. A large K case is considered
in Fig. 4. a which shows that the above approximation is rather accurate. For
smaller K values that are not situated on the tail of the Lagrangian correlation, the
demonstration presented in [18] does not apply. However, as seen in Fig. 4. b for
K = 2 the above approximation is valid and so was in many other cases we have
considered. Thus the asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient in a time dependent stochastic
potential with Kubo number K is

D(∞|K, ρ, Ω) ∼= D(K|∞, ρ, Ω)

(31)

where D(t|K, ρ, Ω) is the time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient obtained for the param-
eters K, ρ, Ω, D(∞|K, ρ, Ω) is its asymptotic value and D(t|∞, ρ, Ω) is the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient obtained in the static potential.

5 ρ dependence

The parameter ρ = |ρ(0)| /λc essentially describes the eﬀect of the initial kinetic
energy of the ions on their Lorentz diﬀusion. It does not appear in the drift transport,
which is determined only by the Kubo number K.

The dependence of the asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient on the Kubo number for
several values of ρ is presented in Fig. 5. One can see that the Larmor radius
produces observable eﬀects even for rather small values (at ρ = 0.1). As expected,
the eﬀect strongly increase with the increase of ρ. This modiﬁcation of the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient due to Larmor radius is complex and it may consist of a strong decrease
as well as of a strong increase, depending on the conditions. Thus, the general idea
that the eﬀective diﬀusion is reduced due to the cyclotron motion which averages
the stochastic potential, is not always true.

Figure 5: The asymptotic diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the Lorentz transport as a
function of K for several values of ρ that label the curves and for Ω = 10. The
result obtained in the guiding center approximation is also represented (dashed
line).

At small Kubo numbers the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is much smaller than in the drift
approximation. It increases in steps that appear, for all values of ρ, at values of K
which are multiples of the cyclotron period T = 2π/Ω. Apart from these steps that
are attenuated at larger K, there is a global increase with K as D(∞|K, ρ, Ω) ∼
DBK = (λ2
c/τ c)K 2 in this regime. This is similar with the quasilinear regime of
the drift transport and corresponds to initial ballistic motion of the guiding centers.
This regime extends to K > 1, up values that increase with the increase of ρ. The
diﬀusion coeﬃcient at this value of K has a value much larger than for the drift
transport.

At larger values of K, the trapping becomes eﬀective and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
has approximately the same K dependence as in the drift transport. The eﬀect of
the Larmor radius consists in an ampliﬁcation factor in the diﬀusion coeﬃcient that
is independent of K in this regime. It increases with the increase of ρ.

6 Ω dependence

The parameter Ω = Ωτ f l describes the eﬀect of the speciﬁc charge of the ions q/m
on their Lorentz diﬀusion. It determines the moments of the steps appearing in the
K dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Apart this, there is no strong inﬂuence
of this parameter when Ω ≫ 1 (see Fig. 6). For small Ω the trajectories become
chaotic and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient has an irregular dependence on the parameters.
Note that the chaotic variations seen in this Figure at large K for Ω = 1 are not

calculation errors (they are not changed by increasing the number of calculated
trajectories, thus the accuracy).

7 Conclusions

We have studied the impurity ion transport produced by the Lorentz force in a tur-
bulent magnetized plasma. Expressions for the time dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient
and for the correlation of the Lagrangian drift velocities are obtained in terms of
a class of smooth, deterministic trajectories by developing a generalization of the
decorrelation trajectory method. This statistical approach is compatible with the
invariance of particle energy.

We have shown that the Larmor radius has a strong eﬀect on impurity ion trans-
port in turbulent plasmas. The generally accepted idea that the eﬀective diﬀusion is
reduced due to the cyclotron motion which averages the stochastic potential, is not
always true. The cyclotron motion can also determine the build up of correlation of
the Lagrangian drift velocity by bringing the particles back in the correlated zone of
the stochastic potential. The correlation L(t) shows a series of periodic peaks, which
lead to incresed diﬀusion coeﬃcients in slowly varying potentials. Consequently, at
given Larmor radius, the transport can be reduced or increased, depending essen-
tially on the value of the Kubo number.

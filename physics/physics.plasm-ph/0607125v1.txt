Abstract

It is shown that an overcritical density plasma slab can be totally transparent to a p-polarized

obliquely incident electromagnetic wave. High transparency is achieved due to the interference

of the evanescent waves in the subcritical region. The transmission coeﬃcient has the resonant

character due to the excitation of a plasma surface mode (plasmon-polariton). It is crucial that two

evanescent waves have certain phase shift to provide non-zero energy ﬂux through non-transparent

region. The required phase shift is obtained at the exact resonance and corresponds to the absolute

transparency. In a warm plasma case, the excitation of the propagating longitudinal (electrostatic)

modes becomes possible. We demonstrate that these longitudinal excitations facilitate the total

transparency of an opaque plasma slab creating additional resonances in the transmission property

of the system.

INTRODUCTION

There exists a large number of theoretical and experimental studies dedicated to

the problem of light interaction with dense media having negative dielectric permittiv-

ity [1, 2, 6, 8, 13]. The increasing interest in the properties of such media has been driven by

their potential applications in diﬀerent branches of science and technology. Understanding

ation with overcritical density plasmas (ǫ = 1

of the fundamental processes that take place during the interaction of electromagnetic radi-
p/ω2 < 0 for ω < ωp) is of great importance
ω2
−
to a number of areas. In particular, one of the challenges of the inertial conﬁnement fusion

(ICF) experiments is the eﬀective heating of the fuel pellet by the laser light (in the direct

drive) or X-rays (in the indirect drive ignition experiments). The two well known absorp-

tion mechanisms in plasma are of collisional [3, 16] and resonant [4, 9, 10] nature. In the

collisional absorption process, the energy of light is converted into thermal electron motion

through electron-ion collisions. In the resonant absorption mechanism, the linear conversion

in nonuniform plasma leads to a resonant excitation of electrostatic plasma wave, which

subsequently decays giving rise to energetic electrons.

In this work we investigate another resonant mechanism that dramatically enhances the

penetration of the electromagnetic ﬁeld into overdense plasma. This mechanism involves

surface plasma wave or plasmon-polariton [12, 19] which may be excited at the plasma-

plasma interface. Unlike bulk plasma waves, which are electrostatic in nature, the surface

waves are of mixed longitudinal-transverse type and can couple to radiating electromagnetic

ﬁelds. As was shown in Ref. [1], at certain conditions the energy of the incident electromag-

netic radiation can be completely absorbed by the plasma through the resonant excitation of

surface plasma waves which subsequently dissipate through standard irreversible processes

like linear wave transformation or collisions.

In this paper we show that the resonant excitation of surface modes may create the con-

dition for absolute transparency of an overdense plasma slab. The transparency mechanism

studied in our work is directly related to the problem of the anomalous transparency of

light in materials with negative permittivities. Media with negative electric permittivity

and magnetic permeability [20] (the so-called left-handed materials or LHM) possess some

unusual optical properties, in particular, the possibility of creating an ”ideal lens” oﬀering

sub-wavelength resolution [8, 17, 18]. As was pointed out by Pendry [17], the superlens

2

is essentially based on the possibility of evanescent waves ampliﬁcation, facilitated by the

excitation of surface plasmons. The ampliﬁcation of the evanescent waves and their inter-

ference are the basic mechanisms behind the anomalous transparency demonstrated in our

work. This indicates the feasibility of superlensing in materials without any restrictions on

the magnetic permeability µ, which has also been noted by Pendry.

In Ref. [21], the authors suggested that the incident electromagnetic wave may excite a

pair of coupled surface plasma waves on both sides of the slab. The energy of the surface

wave running on the opposite side of the slab can be dissipated by reemission of the elec-

tromagnetic waves, which causes the layer to appear totally transparent. However a special

symmetric structure consisting of media with diﬀerent dielectric permittivities has to be

formed in order for a pair of coupled surface waves to exist.

In this paper we reexamine the conditions for total transparency of a layer of overcritical

density plasma. Anomalously high transmission of light is explained through the interference

of the evanescent ﬁelds formed by the incident/emitted electromagnetic radiation and the

ﬁeld of the surface plasma wave. We show that the total transparency of light can be

achieved even when a single surface plasma mode is excited. Therefore, there is no need

to form a symmetric structure in which an overcritical density plasma slab is sandwiched

between two additional layers with specially chosen dielectric permittivities. In other words

anomalous light transmission can be achieved by passing the light through a single plasma-

plasma interface. In most laboratory experiments when high-power laser light interacts with

a solid density target, a prepulse precedes the main laser pulse, creating the plasma density

proﬁles discussed in this paper.

II. SURFACE WAVE ASSISTED TOTAL LIGHT TRANSMISSION IN COLD

PLASMAS

As it was noted above, high transparency of dense plasma occurs as a result of the

resonant excitation of a surface mode. Since the surface of the medium with ǫ < 0 behaves

like surface wave resonator [2], the problem of surface wave excitation is equivalent to that

of resonator excitation. Under resonant conditions (external ﬁeld frequency and its wave

vector’s tangential component have to match those determined from the dispersion relation

for the plasma surface wave) the coupling between the surface eigenmode and the external

3

ﬁeld becomes extremely eﬃcient. The minimum in the reﬂection coeﬃcient (the maximum

in the transmission coeﬃcient in the absence of dissipation) occurs for these resonant values

of the external wave frequency and wave number.

Here we review a dispersion relation for surface waves that exist on a cold plasma-plasma

interface for arbitrary values of dielectric permittivities of the adjacent regions. It is found

by solving the linearized set of cold ﬂuid-Maxwell equations,

It should be noted that here we only keep those solutions that decay away from the interface

(a condition for existence of a well-deﬁned surface mode). Using the boundary conditions

at x = 0 requiring the continuity of Bz and dBz/dx/ǫ, one readily obtains the dispersion

and ǫ2 must have opposite signs, so that one plasma region must have undercritical electron

One important diﬀerence between the surface plasmons running on a plasma-vacuum in-

terface (obtained from (3) by setting ∆ = 0)) and those on a plasma-plasma interface lies in

a fact that the phase velocity in the latter case can exceed that of light, whereas the phase

velocity of the former is always subluminal. Because of this fact, the surface plasmons on a

plasma-plasma interface can couple to radiating electromagnetic ﬁelds, which are evanescent

in plasma but may become propagating if a vacuum region is present beyond plasma lay-

ers. The opposite is also true: if an external p-polarized electromagnetic pulse is obliquely

incident on the structure comprising two plasma layers, it may under a resonant condition

excite a surface plasma mode. On the contrary, a p-polarized electromagnetic pulse obliquely

incident on a vacuum-plasma interface cannot excite a plasma surface wave since the phase

velocity of this collective mode can never exceed the speed of light (the perturbation of the

plasma surface by the external ﬁeld propagates in this case with phase velocity greater than

that of light) and the ﬁeld of the external radiation is not evanescent (as we mentioned ear-

lier, the ﬁelds of the surface wave are decaying away from the interface, or only evanescent

external ﬁelds can excite the plasma surface mode). This means that if a layer of dielectric

is added, so that a system comprising dielectric medium, vacuum and overcritical density

plasma is formed in such a way that the external ﬁeld in vacuum is evanescent (through

total internal reﬂection of light in dielectric material) and the perturbation of the plasma

surface by the evanescent ﬁeld propagates with the phase velocity that is lower than the

speed of light, then the external electromagnetic ﬁeld may excite the surface plasma mode

on a vacuum-plasma interface [2, 6].

Optical properties of a double-plasma system are determined by matching the ﬁelds of

the incident/reﬂected electromagnetic waves with those of the surface wave. Let us consider

a system which is characterized by spatial density (dielectric constant) distribution shown in

Fig. (1). A p -polarized plane electromagnetic wave is obliquely incident on this structure. In

both plasma regions, the electromagnetic ﬁeld B = (0, 0, Bz) is the solution to the following

frequency and incidence angle, one should expect anomalously high transmission of light.

p

Figure (2) shows the transmission coeﬃcient as a function of the incidence angle. As one

can see, there is a sharp increase in the transmission properties of the system when the angle

of incidence matches one of many resonant values of θ = 0.671955 radians at which point

the transmission coeﬃcient reaches the value T = 0.99999. The resonant values exactly

correspond to those given by an expression (3) for the dispersion relation of the surface

plasma wave. Thus, the anomalous transmission occurs even for the system consisting of an

undercritical density plasma layer adjacent to an overcritical density plasma slab, so that

there is no need to form a sandwich-like structure as argued in Refs. ([2, 6, 7]) in which a

second surface plasma wave has to be excited on the opposite side of the overcritical density

layer to achieve the same eﬀect. In other words, the anomalous light transmission can be

achieved through the excitation of a single surface plasma wave. It is interesting to note

that for a sandwich-like system, there are generally two peaks in the transmission coeﬃcient

at two diﬀerent but close angles of incidence[21]. When the second layer of undercritical

plasma is removed, or the thickness of the overcritical density plasma slab becomes too large,

the two solutions degenerate into one, which corresponds to the surface plasmon running on

a single plasma-plasma interface. Analogous eﬀect is seen in quantum mechanics where the

6

energy level of a particle in two-humped potential is split into two energy states that are

close to each other[15]. As the potential is transformed into a single well, the two energy

levels degenerate into a single energy state.

As one can see from Figures (3) and (4) the light transmission is a non-monotonous

function of the widths of both plasma layers with a single maximum reached at certain

correlated values. These values are determined by the interference condition between the

two non-propagating (evanescent) ﬁelds. The evanescent ﬁelds are expressed through the

hyperbolic functions (anomalous transmission occurs when both k1 and k2 take on pure

imaginary values). It can be easily seen that the total ﬁeld in both plasma regions constitutes
a sum of two exponential functions, one decaying with distance e−x and the other growing
ex (x points in the direction from left to right). It is a known fact that a single evanescent

(decaying) wave carries no power.
Poynting vector for this wave is Sx ∼
constant). However, when the total ﬁeld is a superposition of decaying and growing modes,

It can be easily shown that the x component of the

plasma interface. As one can see, the ﬁeld amplitude grows dramatically in the ﬁrst plasma

layer (the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld at the interface is more than fourteen times

of that in the incident wave) to oﬀset its exponential decay in the second to the level of

the incident light. The x-component of the Poynting vector inside plasma regions is equal

to that of the incident radiation-the energy of the ﬁeld is perfectly transferred through the

overcritical density plasma slab. For comparison, Fig. (7) shows the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude

for the case when there is no surface mode excited at the interface. Only exponentially

be transmitted through an opaque high-density slab even without surface waves present at

the boundary, if the slab is thin enough. The eﬀect of the evanescent wave interference is

at play in this case too. The diﬀerence lies in the actual values of the expansion coeﬃcients

A1 and A2 in both cases. When there is no surface wave present, the coeﬃcients are such

III. SURFACE WAVES ON A WARM PLASMA-PLASMA INTERFACE

The results obtained in the previous sections are applicable to the cold plasma case,

limiting its applications to mostly solid-state plasmas. In plasma states created through the

interaction of the high power electromagnetic radiation with solid structures, the electron

temperature can reach values in excess of 1 keV. Therefore, it is important to understand how

the ﬁnite temperature modiﬁes the dispersion relation of the surface wave and subsequently

the anomalous light transmission through the dense plasma.

Kaw and McBride[12] have used hydrodynamic description to investigate the ﬁnite tem-

perature dispersion relation for electromagnetic surface waves propagating on a plasma-

vacuum interface. We generalize their treatment for the case of surface waves on a warm

plasma-plasma interface. The dispersion relation is found from solving the linearized set of

warm ﬂuid-Maxwell equations,

the unknown electron density, hydrodynamic velocity and electromagnetic ﬁelds. Just like

in the cold case, it can be readily solved assuming that density and ﬁeld perturbations are

in the form Ψ(x) exp[i(kyy

along the interface. This gives the following expressions for the electromagnetic ﬁelds and

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

superposition of a transverse and longitudinal perturbations that are completely decoupled

from each other. At this point we would like to bring reader’s attention to the fact that

just as in the cold plasma case, solution (7) describes decaying branches for the transverse

ﬁelds as well as for a longitudinal ﬁeld in the overcritical plasma region (described by the

decay factor γ2 in our notations). However, the density perturbation as well as the asso-

ciated longitudinal electric ﬁeld in the undercritical plasma region are described not by an

evanescent/decaying branch, but rather by a propagating oscillatory function (γ1 takes on

purely imaginary value in this region). The presence of non-decaying oscillations in the

longitudinal ﬁeld signiﬁes the existence of a bulk plasma wave in the undercritical plasma

region. The existence of the bulk plasmon stems from the linear wave conversion process

that occurs at the plasma boundary[14]. In the conversion process, the surface plasma wave

gives rise to a bulk longitudinal plasma mode that propagates away from the interface into

the undercritical density plasma.

The dispersion relation for surface plasma waves on a warm plasma-plasma interface is

found from the boundary conditions on the electromagnetic ﬁelds (tangential components

of both ﬁelds e.q. Ey and Bz should be continuous across the interface). The two additional

boundary conditions are obtained from the integration of the continuity equation and the

9

equation of motion over x coordinate in the limits x =

δ and setting subsequently δ = 0.

±

Assuming that the density perturbation does not have any singularities at the interface (no

surface charge present), the two additional boundary conditions have the following form,

˜n

(8)

These are the continuity conditions for the electron density (normalized to its corresponding

equilibrium value) and ﬂux perturbations across the interface. In order to solve for all six

unknowns in the system, the above four boundary conditions have to be also supplemented

by the requirement that the divergence of the transverse part of the total electric ﬁeld given

by Eqs. (7) be equal to zero. Solving the system of six algebraic equations, one obtains

and ky is normalized to the classical skin depth δ = c/ωp2. Eq. (9) is the general dispersion

relation for surface plasma waves running on a warm homogeneous plasma-plasma interface.

It is interesting to note that matching electromagnetic ﬁelds across the interface couples

their longitudinal and transverse components, so that the resulting surface plasma mode

is of mixed longitudinal-transverse type. Taking the limit ∆

0 reduces this dispersion

relation to that derived by Kaw [12] for the case of plasma-vacuum interface. The cold

plasma dispersion relation is recovered from the limit β

0. Numerical solution of Eq. (9)

shows that for β1,2 > 0.02, which corresponds to electron temperatures 204 eV or lower,

the cold plasma dispersion relation (3) yields solutions that are close to those given by the

→

→

general expression (9), neglecting small imaginary parts in the eigenroots for a case of a

warm plasma. The presence of imaginary values in the dispersion relation is directly linked

to already mentioned conversion process. Because of the surface wave transformation into a

bulk plasmon, its energy leaks out of the surface mode into a bulk plasma mode, which can

be viewed as an eﬀective dissipation of the surface plasmon, making the dispersion relation

complex. It should be noted that the complex conjugate of the roots (with simultaneous
ω and ky → −

ky) are also solutions to the dispersion

reversal of the real parts of ω

→ −

10

relation (9), which is physically related to the opposite process in which the bulk plasmon

converts into the surface wave.

As plasma temperature gets higher, the eigenroots obtained from Eq. (9) can signiﬁcantly

deviate from those given in the cold plasma limit as can be seen from Fig. (8). This fact

should be taken into consideration when investigating a possible surface wave induced plasma

heating channel in ICF experiments where the initial temperatures (due to slab interaction

with laser prepulse) can exceed 1 keV for ultra-intense laser pulses.

IV. TEMPERATURE EFFECTS AND THE ANOMALOUS LIGHT TRANSMIS-

SION

Let us consider a structure similar to that of the cold plasma case and characterized by

the spatial density (dielectric constant) distribution shown in Fig. (1), but with non-zero

electron temperature. A p -polarized plane electromagnetic wave is obliquely incident on this

structure. In both plasma regions, the electromagnetic ﬁelds B = (0, 0, Bz), E = (Ex, Ey, 0)

where T and R designate the ﬁeld components for the transmitted and reﬂected waves. By
matching the solutions at all boundaries (requiring continuity of Ey, Bz, n0 ˜Vx and ˜n/n0

coeﬃcients. It should be noted that in Ref. [7] the authors used similar approach to inves-

tigate the anomalous transmission of light through a structure consisting of an overdense

warm plasma slab spaced between two underdense plasma layers. However, the choice of

boundary conditions on the ﬁelds used by the authors, speciﬁcally the continuity of the spa-

transmission/reﬂection coeﬃcients are extremely bulky functions of electron temperature,

electromagnetic wave incidence angle, its frequency, both plasma layers electron densities

and thicknesses.

As mentioned in the previous section, the dispersion relation for the surface plasma waves

at non-zero temperatures can signiﬁcantly deviate from that obtained in the cold plasma

limit. Since the anomalous transmission of light is due to the excitation of the surface plas-

mons, the resulting transmission coeﬃcient exhibits thermal eﬀects that are not seen in cold

12

plasmas. Figure (9) shows the dependence of the transmission coeﬃcient on the thermal

electron velocity vT h =

T /me. As one can see, it shows high frequency oscillations in the

electron temperature space. The presence of these regular oscillations in the transmission

p

of the system is related to the linear wave conversion processes that occur at the plasma

boundaries. The surface wave excites a bulk longitudinal plasma mode propagating in the

underdense plasma layer away from the plasma-plasma boundary. When it reaches the

vacuum-plasma interface, the longitudinal plasma wave converts into a transverse propagat-

ing electromagnetic wave, which interferes with the reﬂected light. Thus, in the general case

the interference between the incident/reﬂected ﬁelds, surface plasma wave induced ﬁelds and

the ﬁelds created through the linear conversion processes determine the transmission.

The temperature oscillations can be understood using the following simpliﬁed model. The
surface plasma wave excites a bulk plasmon propagating at angle θ′ to the surface normal.

This angle can be found from matching the y components of both modes’ wave numbers to

give:

sin θ′ =

sin θ

β
√ǫ

The plasma wave propagates the distance L = d/ cos θ′ with phase velocity vph = cβ/√ǫ.

Therefore, the phase diﬀerence ∆φ = ω∆t between the reﬂected light and that emitted

through the conversion process is,

When the phase diﬀerence is equal to a multiple of 2π, both components interfere construc-

tively giving rise to large reﬂection and thus low transmission. Therefore, one arrives at

a following temperature condition at which minimal light transmission occurs through the

With a simple estimate given by Eq. (14), we are able to recover some of the minima in the

transmission coeﬃcient obtained from the complete solution of Eqs. (9). Other minima in

the transmission coeﬃcient, which are not described by Eq. (14) are due to other conversion

13

processes like the incident wave transformation into a longitudinal plasma mode at the

vacuum-plasma interface that travels to the plasma-plasma interface, gets reﬂected (exciting

a surface mode in a process) and travels back to the plasma-vacuum interface converting

to the transverse electromagnetic wave. All these conversion processes contribute to the

transmission properties of the double-plasma system, making it highly oscillatory function

of not only the electron temperature but also the underdense plasma layer thickness d as

can be seem from Fig. (10). The multiple peaks present in the transmission coeﬃcient in

this case can also be explained through the constructive interference between the reﬂected

electromagnetic ﬁeld and the ﬁeld created as a result of the linear wave conversion process.

Since the phase diﬀerence ∆φ also depends on the underdense layer thickness, one can arrive

at a similar condition for the plasma thickness d at which minimal light transmission occurs

through the system,

A simple estimate given by Eq. (15) can also recover the minima in the transmission coeﬃ-

cient as a function of the undercritical density plasma layer thickness for a case of non-zero

electron temperature. As the plasma temperature increases, the resonant condition for the

excitation of the surface wave changes according to the dispersion relation given by Eq. (9),

shifting the peak in the transmission coeﬃcient to smaller angles. A distinct diﬀerence be-

tween the zero temperature and a warm plasma case lies in a fact that there is only a single

peak in the transmission coeﬃcient (as a function of the undercritical density plasma layer

thickness) in the cold plasma case, whereas the number of transmission peaks in a warm

plasma is quite large. Unlike the cold plasma case where the energy of the external radiation

is transferred through the constructive interference of evanescent ﬁelds, in a warm plasma

case the superposition of the propagating longitudinal plasma wave ﬁelds (in a undercriti-

cal density plasma slab) and the evanescent transverse electromagnetic ﬁelds determine the

amount of the transmitted light as can be seen from ﬁgure (11), where the x components of

time-averaged total (which includes the contribution of plasma electrons) Poynting vector

and the real part of the electric ﬁeld are shown. As expected, the electromagnetic ﬁeld has a

form of the superposition of the evanescent and propagating/oscillatory branches and under

resonant condition the energy is totally transferred through the system. In addition, the

14

results of our calculations show that in a warm underdense plasma layer the energy is mainly

carried by the longitudinal electron plasma oscillations, facilitating the total transparency

of the considered dual-layer system for quite large thicknesses of an undercritical density

plasma slab.

V. CONCLUSIONS

It is shown here that overcritical density plasma can be made transparent to external

radiation. The total transparency can be achieved even with a single surface mode excited

on a plasma-plasma boundary. The anomalous transmission is explained through the in-

terference eﬀect between the evanescent ﬁelds of the incident electromagnetic radiation and

those associated with the surface plasmons. Superposition of two (decaying and growing)

evanescent modes can carry the power of the incident radiation over to the other side of a

high-density plasma slab, making it totally transparent to light in a case when irreversible

dissipation is absent. We have also shown that the excitation of the longitudinal plasma

waves creates a multiplicity of additional resonances corresponding to the absolute trans-

parency. We suggest that the mechanism investigated in this paper may be responsible for

the anomalous transparency of metals observed recently in a number of experiments [8, 17].

The role of dissipation eﬀects is twofold, depending on possible applications of the surface

wave phenomenon. In ICF experiments where high absorption of the incident radiation is

sought, the presence of irreversible dissipation is necessary for eﬀective heating of a fuel

pellet through damping of the surface plasma waves.

If dissipation is absent, the energy

of the incident light will be totally re-emitted by these waves back into vacuum. If on the

other hand a high transmission of light is needed, the dissipation plays a detrimental role,

limiting the transmitting ability of the system. Therefore, a close control over a number of

physical parameters (electron density, temperature, thickness) of the double-layer system is

needed for successful technological implementation of the surface wave eﬀect.

The ﬁnal point we would like to mention is related to the fact that since the Maxwell

equations are invariant under reversal of time and space coordinates, the order at which

the incident electromagnetic wave encounters both plasma layers (an undercritical density

layer followed by that with overcritical density or vice versa) does not eﬀect its transmission

ability.

Abstract

Classical motion of positronium embedded in a magnetic ﬁeld is studied, and computation shows

the emergence of chaotic orbits. Recent work investigating quantum behavior of this system pre-

dicts extremely long lifetimes [5] [6]. Chaos assisted tunneling however may lead to signiﬁcant

shortening of the lifetime of this system.

Two interacting charged particles placed in a magnetic ﬁeld exhibit chaotic motion. This

has been studied for the hydrogen and Rydberg atom [1] and the scattering of electrons on

positive nuclei [2].This has an impact on the electrical conductivity of fully ionized plasmas

[3] [4].

Here we study the classical motion of positronium in a magnetic ﬁeld. In the absence of

a magnetic ﬁeld the positronium has a very short lifetime. It was found by Ackermann et.

al.[5] that in a strong magnetic ﬁeld the positronium can have an extremely long lifetime

”up to the order of one year”[5].

We ﬁnd that the classical motion is chaotic, which usually leads to chaos assisted tunneling

[7] which should signiﬁcantly reduce the lifetime of this system.

The calculation includes the case of crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds, provided that

the ratio of the ﬁeld strengths E/B does not exceed the speed of light. In this case the

electric ﬁeld can be eliminated by a Lorentz transformation.

The motion of two particles with charges +e and -e of equal mass m moving, in a

uniform magnetic ﬁeld B are described by the equations

m¨r1 = e ˙r1 × B −

e2
4πǫ0

r1 − r2
| r1 − r2 |3

m¨r2 = −e ˙r2 × B +

e2
4πǫ0

r1 − r2
| r1 − r2 |3

Adding (1) and (2) gives

m(¨r1 + ¨r2) = e( ˙r1 − ˙r2) × B

Introducing the new coordinates

and integrating Eq. (3) results in

r1 + r2 = R

r1 − r2 = r

m ˙R − er × B = α

where α is a constant vector. Subtracting Eq.(2) from (1) gives

m¨r = e ˙R × B −

e2r
2πǫ0r3

and using Eq.(6)

m¨r =

(er × B + α) × B −

Introducing the cyclotron frequency ωc = eB/m, and choosing B pointing in the z

direction B = Be3, Eqs. (8) and (6) become

¨r/ω2

c = (r × e3) × e3 + α × e3/(eB) −

m
2πǫ0B2

r

r3

˙R/ωc − r × e3 = α/eB

With the dimensionless variables ωct → t and r(2πǫ0B2/m)1/3 → r, one arrives to the

dimensionless equations of motion

¨r = (r × e3) × e3 + α′

× e3 − r/r3

˙R − r × e3 = α′

where α′

= α/eB is the dimensionless constant vector. Since r × e3 has no component

in the z direction, it is convenient to chose a coordinate system where the initial value of
˙Rz(0) = 0, so the constant α′
= ae1 + be2.Without loss
of generality one may chose either a=0 or b=0. So Eq.(11) becomes

is a vector in the x − y plane, α′

¨r + r⊥ = −r/r3 + be1

where ⊥ means perpendicular to the z axis.

First we study the two dimensional case

¨x + x = −x/r3 + b

¨y + y = −y/r3

with the Hamiltonian

H = p2/2 + r2/2 − 1/r − bx

(15)

Since energy is conserved phase space is three dimensional. The potential energy V =

r2/2 − 1/r − bx is singular at r → 0, and develops a minimum when b ≥ 1.89. 1 shows

equipotential lines for b=3. Surface of section plots in the x, px plane have been computed for

diﬀerent values of the two parameters: b and the energy E.2.ashows four plots, E = 0, b = 1

and b = 3; E = −.5, b = 1 and 3. The plots appear regular without any chaotic orbits.

We have carried out many more computations for diﬀerent values of E and b with similar

results. It appears therefore that an additional constant of motion exists, but the analytic

expression has not been found. We have also carried out computations to ﬁnd the largest

Lyapunov exponent which turned out to be zero as expected for non-chaotic orbits.

Turning to the three dimensional case we study the α = 0 limit.

in this case it is

convenient to introduce polar coordinates where the system is described by the Hamiltonian

2

H = P

ρ /2 + P 2

z /2 + P 2

ϕ/(2ρ2) + ρ2/2 − 1/pρ2 + z2

(16)

where ρ2 = x2 + y2 , and ϕ is an ignorable coordinate so Pϕ = const. This gives the

equations of motion

˙Pρ = − ∂H

∂ρ = −ρ + P 2

ϕ/ρ3 −

ρ

˙Pz = − ∂H

∂z = −

z
(ρ2+z2)3/2

(17)

A surface of section plot (ρ, Pρ) in the z=0 plane is shown in 3 for E=-.5, Pϕ = .25. The

existence of chaotic orbits is obvious, so the three dimensional equations of motion are not
integrable. To show that chaotic orbits exist for α 6= 0, the largest Lyapunov exponent has

been computed for the three dimensional case for b=3, as shown in 4, using the algorithm

as described in Ref.[8] It converges to a value larger then zero as expected.

In conclusion the motion of positronium immersed in a magnetic ﬁeld is chaotic in the

classical limit, therefore the long lifetime predicted in the quantum limit is unlikely.

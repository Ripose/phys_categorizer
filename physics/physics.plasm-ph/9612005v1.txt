Abstract

The noisy kinetic derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (KNLS) is inves-

tigated as a model of stationary collisionless Alfv´enic shocklet turbulence and

compressible MHD turbulence in a magnetized system, in general. Dissipa-

tion arises from Landau damping, enters via nonlinearity, and is distributed

over all scales. The theory predicts that two diﬀerent regimes or phases of

turbulence are possible, depending on the ratio of steepening to damping co-

m1/m2|
eﬃcient (m1/m2). For weak damping (
|

> 1), a stationary state of

KNLS turbulence does not exist in the hydrodynamic limit. Rather, spikey,

small scale structure is predicted. For

< 1, a regime of smooth,

m1/m2|
|

hydrodynamic turbulence is predicted.

The theory of astrophysical (e.g. solar wind) turbulence has been a topic of interest for

some time. However, there is still no common view of this subject. In general, two diﬀerent

schools of thought have developed. One of them is based on a Kolmogoroﬀ-type theory of

inertial range cascading. It was successfully utilized [1] to explain the power law spectra of

MHD turbulence observed in the solar wind. This theory accounts for the interaction (scat-

tering) of a large number of Alfv´enic Fourier modes propagating at diﬀerent angles to the

ambient magnetic ﬁeld and thus describes small amplitude background of weak turbulence.

An alternative approach is based on the study of nonlinear wave evolution equations with

external noisy drive (e.g. the noisy DNLS equation), and is applicable to relatively large

wave amplitudes. Such theories approach turbulence as an ensemble of nonlinear structures,

e.g. shocks, discontinuities, and high-amplitude waves, which are typical constituents of

the interplanetary plasma [2]. This course of investigation was pursued by previous authors

who undertook computational studies of the noisy DNLS equation [3]. Stationarity was

achieved by inserting ad-hoc viscous damping (later linked to ﬁnite plasma conductivity [4])

into the otherwise conservative DNLS equation. However, when β

1 and Te/Ti ≃

≃

1 (as

in solar wind plasma), Alfv´en waves couple to strongly damped ion acoustic modes. As a

consequence, the kinetically modiﬁed DNLS [5,6], referred to as the KNLS, which exhibits

intrinsically dissipative nonlinear coupling, emerges as a superior basic model. Numerical

solution of the KNLS reveals a new class of dissipative structures, which appear through

the balance of nonlinear steepening with collisionless nonlinear damping [7]. The resulting

quasi-stationary structures typically have narrow spectra, consisting of only a few low-k

harmonics, and exhibit spontaneous rotational/directional discontinuities at the shock, with

negligible phase variation elsewhere.

Here, we present the ﬁrst analytical study of the noisy KNLS equation as a generic

model of collisionless, high-amplitude Alfv´enic shocklet turbulence. Indeed, this is, to our

knowledge, the ﬁrst structure-based theory of compressible MHD turbulence in a collisionless

system. Stationarity is maintained via the balance of noise and dissipative nonlinearity. A

one-loop renormalization group calculation (equivalent [8] to a direct interaction approxima-

2

tion (DIA) [9] closure) is utilized. Of course, the applicability of the renormalization group

method is not known a priori. Such an issue is beyond the scope of this paper, however.

Although the KNLS describes both quasi-parallel and oblique waves [5], we consider here

the simpler case of quasi-parallel propagation. The general case will be addressed on future

publication. The noisy KNLS is, thus, a generic model of strong, compressible Alfv´enic tur-

bulence and may be relevant to the solar wind, interstellar medium, shock acceleration as

well as to compressible MHD theory, as a whole. Note that this perspective is analogous to

that of the noisy Burgers equation model of compressible ﬂuid turbulence [10]. Several fea-

tures which are not common in standard MHD turbulence theories appear in this model. It

is shown that the dissipative integral coupling renormalizes the wave train velocity, in addi-

tion to inducing nonlinear damping and dispersion. Moreover, consideration of the resulting

solvability condition for a stationary state in the hydrodynamic limit (ω, k

0) suggests

→

that KNLS turbulence can exist in one of two diﬀerent states or phases, corresponding to

small-scale spikey shocklets (i.e. no hydrodynamic regime) or a smoother, hydrodynamic

state, respectively.

equation is not Galilean invariant, hence the v0 term is explicit. The packet velocity v0 is

renormalized due the broken symmetry between +k and

damping. This precludes the conventional practice of transforming to the frame co-moving

is the parallel heat conduction coeﬃcient which

ear steepening of a wave via coupling to the self-generated density perturbation (associated

with an acoustic mode). The term m2 corresponds to kinetic damping of a wave by res-

onant particles, which rapidly sinks energy from all harmonics, unlike viscous dissipation.

We emphasize that the KNLS is intrinsically a nonlinearly dissipative equation, i.e. there

is no linear damping retained here. In this regard, we comment that there appear to be

two meaningful paradigm problems to be explored. One is to retain both linear growth and

damping in the KNLS. In this case the results will necessarily be quite model dependent.

The other, which we pursue here, is to study the purely nonlinear problem with noisy drive.

This case allows us to isolate and focus on the intrinsically nonlinear dynamics of the KNLS

equation.

equation for the renormalized coeﬃcients v and µ. The ﬁxed point of this recursion relation

gives the self-consistent values of these coeﬃcients. Note, the vertex λ is also renormalized,

since the KNLS (and DNLS) is not Galilean invariant. Replacing the bare v0, µ0 with their

The real parts, vr and µr, represent the amplitude dependent speed of a wave packet (note,

there is a momentum transfer from waves to resonant particles in this model) and nonlinear

dispersion (i.e. an amplitude dependent frequency shift in Fourier space), respectively. The

imaginary parts, vi and µi, correspond to damping processes. In particular, vi describes the

exponential damping (´a la phase mixing of a wave packet) and µi describes turbulent, viscous

dissipation. It is easily seen that for m2 →
frame with v0 = 0. Thus, no additional phase-mixing terms appear, since the terms k′k

and k′′k vanish upon integration over

resulting in the novel phase-mixing and phase velocity renormalization terms (analogous to

nonlinear frequency shifts) encountered here.

We seek solutions in the hydrodynamic limit ω

white noise, i.e. f k

= f . This assumption is not too artiﬁcial, since MHD waves are usu-

ally pumped at large scales (small-k) and the large-k tail is heavily damped by collisionless

dissipation, which is an increasing function of k. Ordered by powers of k, the nonlinear

term in the integrals contains k3, k4, . . . contributions. However, the hydrodynamic behavior

is completely determined by the small-k, ω limit. Thus, by omitting higher-k terms, Eq.

(6) naturally splits into two equation for v and µ, respectively. The ω′, ω′′-integrations can

be easily performed in complex plane. It is convenient to introduce dimensionless variables

x′ = k′ ˜µ/˜v, x′′ = k′′ ˜µ/˜v. The k′, k′′-integrals in Eq. (6), diverge as k′, k′′

For completeness, the perturbation parameter λ must be renormalized, because the

KNLS is not Galilean invariant. Corrections to λ follow from the third order expansion

Abstract

The dynamic sructure factor as the basic quantity describing the

collective excitations in a ﬂuid is considered. We consider the cases

of neutral and Coulombic ﬂuids. The classical method of moments is

applied to construct the dynamic structure factor satisfying all known

sum rules. An interpolational formula is found which expresses the

dynamic characteristics of a classical or quantum ﬂuid system in terms

of its static correlation parameters. The analytical results based on

1

the theory of moments are compared with Molecular dynamics data

for various model systems.

1 Introduction

In the past there has been considerable interest in the time dependence of

correlation functions or equivalently of the frequency dependence of structure

factors. These functions has been studied in neutral and Coulomb ﬂuids both

theoretically and by molecular-dynamic simulations [1]. Under a neutral

ﬂuid we understand here a ﬂuid of particles interacting via a short-ranged

potential. That means the termin neutral ﬂuids includes such nonneutral

systems as dusty plasmas [2] and charged colloidal suspensions [3] where the

interaction between the charged particles of one subsystem is screened by the

motion of particles from another subsystem.

Several approaches are devoted to the study of dynamic properties of

strongly interacting ﬂuid systems.

In a rather incomplete list we mention

the approaches in Refs. [4, 5] based on the memory function formalism, the

approaches based on the theory of moments [6, 7], and the approach based on

the quasilocalized charge approximation [8]. It is interesting to note that all

2

these approaches succeeded by exploiting the method of collective variables

[9] in various modiﬁcations.

This paper gives a short overview of the application of the method of mo-

ments to the determination of dynamic properties of coupled ﬂuid systems.

As the main quantity describing the dynamics of a systems we consider the

dynamic structure factor. The dynamic structure factor may be measured in

scattering experiments. The peaks in the dynamic structure factor determine

the collective excitations of the system. There may propagate diﬀerent col-

lective excitations depending on the type of the system (neutral or Coulomb).

Generally speaking in neutral ﬂuids we deal with sound modes whereas the

plasma mode is a ﬁnite frequency mode. The diﬀerent behavior of the modes

is connected with the diﬀerent behavior of the interaction potential Fourier

transform at small wavenumbers k. In a neutral ﬂuid the Fourier transform

is ﬁnite, in the Coulomb case it diverges for k

0.

2 Dynamic properties of neutral ﬂuids

We consider a system of N particles of one species with masses m and in-

teracting via a pair potential V (r). The Fourier transform of the interaction

In order to construct the dynamic structure factor as a central function for

the determination of the dynamic properties of the system it is useful to

and having a positive imaginary part there Im qn(k, ω + iη) > 0, η > 0, it

where ω2

1(k) = M2(k)/M0(k) and ω2

approximation n = 1 leading to the correct frequency moments M0 and M2.

Using the Nevanlinna formula Eq. (10) we obtain (q1 = q1,r + iq1,i),

We have no phenomenological basis for the choice of that function q1(z) which

would provide the exact expression for S(k, z). We mention that the physical

meaning of the function h1(z) =

iq1(z) is that of a memory function since

−

from Eq. (13) it follows that the inverse Fourier transform of the function

C(k, z) = (1/iπ)

(14)

A simple approximation is to put the function q1(z) equal to its static value

q1(z) = q1(0) = iν(k, ) and Eq. (14) simpliﬁes to the equation of a damped

oscillator with frequency ω1 and damping constant ν.

classical neutral ﬂuid, ω2

c (k) = ω2

1(k) = M2(k)
M0(k)

= k2kBT

mS(k) . The corresponding

generalization to the quantum case (T = 0) reads ω0(k) = ¯hk2

2mS(k) [10].

Consider now the long-wavelength behavior k

0. In this case the static

structure factor S(k

0) = nkBT κT is determined by the compressibility

→

κT =

(1/V ) (∂V /∂P )T . Then the dispersion relation reads

which diﬀers from the familiar dispersion equation for the sound wave by

the factor γ. For a model of independent oscillators: cp = cv and γ = 1.

Therefore the above approximation for the static structure factor based on

the Nevanlinna equation with n = 1 represents the model of independent

damped quasiparticles.

To go beyond this approximation one has to choose the 3-moment ap-

proximation n = 2 in the Nevanlinna hierarchy reproducing the moments

M0, M2 and M4. Within this approximation and choosing q2(k, ω) = h(k)

we obtain the following expression for the dynamic structure factor:

3 Dynamic properties of Coulomb ﬂuids

Consider a one component plasma (OCP) consisting of N particles with

charges Ze and masses m interacting via the Coulomb potential Vc(r) =

Z 2e2/r and embedded in a neutralizing homogeneous background. The clas-

sical OCP may be characterized by the coupling parameter Γ = e2

akB T , a =

(3V /4πN)1/3 being the Wigner-Seitz radius. The quantum plasma has an ad-

ditional parameter - the degeneration parameter θ = √2mkBT /¯h2(3π2n)2/3.

In what follows for the case of simplicity we concentrate on a classical plasma.

For Γ

1 we deal with an ideal (or Vlasov) plasma, for Γ

1 the plasma is

≪

≫

called a strongly coupled one. The Vlasov approximation takes into account

only the mean ﬁeld part of the interaction and the dispersion relation for the

longitudinal plasmons is predicted as ω2

c (k) = ω2

with the plasma

(cid:19)

frequency ω2

p = 4πZ 2e2n

m

and the squared inverse Debye-length k2

D = 4πZ 2e2n

kBT

.

The Vlasov theory predicts a strong positive dispersion of the plasmons, i.e.,

dω/dk > 0. However, in a coupled plasma the potential energy plays an im-

portant role and the Vlasov approximation is not longer valid. To construct

the dynamic structure factor for a coupled plasma consider the frequency

moments of the dynamic structure factor S(k, ω). The frequency moments

formally coincides with that of a neutral plasma (Eqs. (6)-(8)). The only dif-

9

ference is that the interaction potential of the neutral ﬂuid has to be replaced

by that of the Coulomb system. The application of the Nevanlinna formula

leads then to a corresponding hierarchy of approximations for the dynamic

structure factor.

If one is interested in the structure factor of a quantum

system again Eqs. (10) hold, if one replaces S(k, ω) on the left hand side of

the Eqs. (10) by the loss function R(k, ω = [(1

exp(

β¯hω))/β¯hω] S(k, ω).

−

However, in the quantum case additional contributions to the zeroth and

fourth frequency moment occur [6, 7].

Consider the 3-moment approximation Eq. (17). If one is interested in

the investigation of the high-frequency collective excitation spectrum only

it is suﬃcient to neglect the function h(k) since the damping (described by

the function h) is small in strongly coupled plasmas.

If one puts h(k) =

0 Eq.

(17) provides the expression of the dynamic structure factor for a

strongly coupled plasma obtained within the QLC approach [8], if the thermal

contributions may be neglected with respect to the correlation contributions.

Within the simple approximation h(k) = 0 the dynamic structure factor has

δ peaks at the frequencies ωc which in the classical case are determined by

sion relation ω2

c (k) = ω2

p [1 + k2a2(

0.08 + Γ−1)] and one predicts a negative

−

dispersion for Γ > 13.

To study the dynamic structure factor one has to go beyond the simple

approximation h = 0. To satisfy the low frequency behavior one may choose

the approximation Eq. (18). To check the quality of the predictions from

our approximation molecular dynamic simulations have been performed for

comparison [7]. The semiclassical simulations were performed to model a

quantum gas of 250 electrons moving in a cubic box with periodic bound-

ary conditions.The thermal equilibrium was established by a Monte Carlo

procedure. A detailed description of the semiclassical model used in the

simulations may be found elsewhere [7]. In Figs. 1 and 2 we have plotted

the loss function R(q, ω) (q = ka) for various values of wavenumbers q for

11

the cases of strong (Γ = 10 ) and very strong coupling (Γ = 100 ) [7]. In

both cases we obtain a sharp plasmon peak at small q values, with increas-

ing wavenumber the plasmon peak widens. Almost no dispersion has been

observed at Γ = 10. This is in good agreement with the above estimation

for the critical value Γ = 13 separating regimes with positive dispersion from

that with negative dispersion. For the case of very strong coupling Γ = 100

we have found a strong negative dispersion. In Figs. 3 and 4 we present the

results of the MD data and compare them with our analytical approxima-

tion Eqs. (17) and (18). To calculate the parameters ω1(k) and ω2(k) we

have used the static structure factor obtained from the HNC equations. The

value S(k, 0) determining the parameter h(k) might be taken from the MD

simulations. However, the dynamic structure factor at the zero frequency

can be obtained with the necessary accurazy only from long time simula-

tions. Alternatively we have choosen the value S(k, 0) to ﬁt the model to the

MD data. It should be mentioned that the value S(k, 0) mainly determines

the width of the plasmon peak, the peak position is quite insensitive to the

choice of the value S(k, 0). From the ﬁgures it can be seen that there is a

reasonable agreement between the MD data and the present approxiamtion

based on the sum rules. The peak position is reproduced with high accuracy,

12

the agreement in the width of the peaks is less satisfactory. One concludes

that the static approximation q2(k, ω) = ih(k) undersetimates the damping

of the quasiparticles.

4 Conclusions

In this paper we have shown that the application of the classical theory of

moments gives a satisfactory description of many properties of neutral and

Coulomb ﬂuids. The Nevanlinna formula generates approximate expressions

for the dynamic structure factor in terms of their static correlations. The

quality of the Nevanlinna expression mainly depends on the quality of the

model used to calculate the static properties of the ﬂuid. The presented

results may be improved by a speciﬁcation of the interpolation function

q2(k, ω).

In conclusion, the present approach has been also used to calculate the

dynamic structure factor of two-dimensional electron gas [11], of binary ionic

mixtures [12] and of two-component plasmas [13]. It had been extended to

magnetized plasmas [14] and can be generalized to calculate partial dynamic

structure factors. Here, the matrix form of the Nevanlinna formula becomes

13

helpful.

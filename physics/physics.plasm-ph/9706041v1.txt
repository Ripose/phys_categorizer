General dispersion equation for oscillations and waves
in non-collisional Maxwellian plasmas

V. N. Soshnikov ∗
Plasma Physics Dept., All-Russian Institute of Scientiﬁc and Technical Information
of the Russian Academy of Sciences (VINITI, Usievitcha 20, 125219 Moscow, Russia)

We propose a new and eﬀective method to ﬁnd plasma oscillatory and wave modes. It implies
searching a pair of poles of two-dimensional (in coordinate x and time t) Laplace transform of self-
consistent plasma electric ﬁeld E(x, t) → Ep1p2 , where p1 ≡ −iω, p2 ≡ ik are Laplace transform
parameters, that is determining a pair of zeros of the following equation

Ep1p2

= 0.

This kind of conditional equation for searching double poles of Ep1p2 (which correspond to terms
in double Laurent expansion of Ep1p2 ) we call “general dispersion

equation”, so far as it is used to ﬁnd the pair values (ω(n), k(n)), n = 1, 2, . . .. It diﬀers basically
from the classic dispersion equation ǫl (ω, k) = 0 (and is not its generalization), where ǫl is longi-
tudinal dielectric susceptibility, its analytical formula being derived according to Landau analytical
continuation. In distinction to ǫl, which is completely plasma characteristic, the function Ep1p2 is
deﬁned by initial and boundary conditions and allows one to ﬁnd all the variety of asymptotical
plasma modes for each concrete plasma problem. In this paper we demonstrate some possibilities
of applying this method to the simplest cases of collisionless ion-electron plasma and to electron
plasma with collisions described by a collision-relaxation term −νf (1).

PACS numbers: 52.25 Dg; 52.35 Fp.
Key words: plasma oscillations; plasma waves; Landau damping; dispersion equation.

Up to date the textbook approach to determining dispersion dependence of oscillation frequency on wave number
ω(k) implies solving some dispersion equation, the latter being found using Landau rule of bypassing poles in his
theory of collisionless damping (“Landau damping”, see1). This theory is based on analytical continuation of complex
function deﬁned as Cauchy integral

where the integration is performed primarily along the real z-axis. This integral is well deﬁned for Im (ω) > 0 and
Im (ω) < 0. Landau considers as physically deﬁned just the function F +(ω) in the upper half-plane of ω due to
adiabatic in time switching on. Then he tries to determine analytical continuation of this function to the region
Im (ω) < 0 through the point Im (ω) = 0 on the real axis, with deformation of the integration contour to the lower
half-plane.

One could say that analytical continuation through integration contour A (i.e. the real axis R) does not exist by
its very deﬁnition as a regular function, since F +

The mathematical part of Landau theory (see f.e.7) contrary to the said in3,4 does not give rise to any objections.

However there are still the following logical objections:

1. Landau solution in the form of a damping wave must satisfy primary Vlasov equations, but it does not.

2. In the original Landau contour integral F (ω) there is the physically discriminated real axis of integration over
velocity component vx. One solves some initial problem in the time interval 0
, and coordinate
dependence is introduced through the common factor exp(ikx) for all times t. Here initial conditions really are
in no connection with unknown conditions at t < 0. Writing solution in the form of inverse Laplace transform
iω physically leads one to search in the ﬁrst place some ﬁnite (damping or
(“original”) with parameter p =
oscillatory non-damping) solutions with ω = ω0 −
iδ, ω0 > 0 and δ > 0. These solutions correspond to the lower
half-plane of complex frequency ω.
The function F −(ω) is analytical in the lower half-plane, and there is no logical necessity to use analytical
continued from the upper half-plane function F +(ω), or consider some analytical continuation into upper half-
plane, where oscillatory solutions are exponentially divergent. As it is also well-known, the integrand of inverse
Laplace transform L(F ) in this case has no poles and, correspondingly, no solutions in the form of damping
wave (that means the absence of solutions of equivalent dispersion equation).

Therefore there is discrepancy between mathematical correctness of Landau theory and unjustifyness and unnecessity
of its real application.

As it has been pointed out in2 the solution of “Landau problem” is really non-damping standing oscillations (but
not a travelling damping wave) as it has been proved in3,4, and the desired damping solution can be attained through

the transition to a non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution function (“cut-oﬀ” velocity distribution). Probably,
it is equivalent to solving dispersion equation which can be solved with respect to δ owing to using just non-Maxwellian
background distribution function. But evidently, such solution is not completely deﬁned due to the arbitrariness of
Maxwell distribution “cut-oﬀ”. And besides that, under special condition of “cut-oﬀ” v < c where c is the light
velocity, one should in any case solve the relativistic kinetic equation.

A quite diﬀerent, but general way to consider plasma oscillations in frames of linearized Vlasov equations was

p2 = ik of Laplace transformation. Depending on initial and boundary conditions one obtains diﬀerent analytical
expressions for the function Ep1p2 . The equation for double poles (in p1 and p2) of this function deﬁnes diﬀerent
asymptotic oscillatory modes as the pairs (ω(n),k(n)), n = 1, 2, . . . . So, it is natural to consider the equation for poles
of Ep1p2 as “general dispersion equation”. The general asymptotic solution is obtained as a sum of exponential modes
with coeﬃcients deﬁned by residues, but substitution of this solution f (1) (x, t, ~v) and E(x, t) into Vlasov equations
does not lead, in general, to any dispersion equation connecting ω and k. That is, the dispersion equation, in common
sense, does not exist. Indeed, it ought to suppose that, vice versa, for a given concrete problem its asymptotical
solution in the form of coupled oscillatory modes must identically satisfy Eqns.(3)-(5), and this can be tested by
direct substitution of solution in Eqns.(3)-(5).

This approach appears to be more general, allowing one to ﬁnd additional oscillatory modes also in the case of

non-Maxwellian distribution functions, when the usual dispersion equation could take place and have solutions.

These statements which were developed in4 appear to form a new and unexpected, though very simple, approach to
the problem of plasma oscillations. In this paper we demonstrate the very possibility of applying the two-dimensional
Laplace transformation for ﬁnding ion-electron oscillations and waves in collisionless Maxwellian plasma and electron

assumed to be given in the plane x = 0 (the plane geometry). The one-sided Laplace transformation allows one

Besides that in all the cases the damping solutions are not of the speciﬁc Landau damping type.
As it has been noted in4, the presence of growing solutions is connected with the inconsistency of the initial and
boundary conditions on the ﬁeld E(0, t) and functions f (1) (0, t, ~v) and f (1) (x, 0, ~v) , which are not independent.
The initial and boundary conditions must be given in such a way, that the residues sums in the coeﬃcients of
exponentially growing modes be cancelled. Such consistency condition leads to linear equations connecting pre-
exponential coeﬃcients of diﬀerent modes and makes the existence of plasma oscillations not independent on electric
ﬁeld impossible.

Laplace images of the form (15) or (23) are general solutions of given concrete problems after applying inverse
Laplace transformation. It stays now but an open question, whether one can with integration over p2, say, to pass to
1-dimensional Landau initial problem and to his 1-dimensional Laplace image. This is in accord with above statement
that any plasma oscillatory problem is not strongly only initial or only boundary, but instead mixed problem with
coupled oscillatory modes.

It should be noted that a single-valued solution of Vlasov ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equations for the self-
consistent plasma electric ﬁeld Econ(x, t) is completely deﬁned by initial condition Econ(x, 0) and by a single-point
boundary condition Econ(0, t) only. It appears to contradict to a possibility of an arbitrary setting electric ﬁeld in
several points using some electrode system. This contradiction is removed by taking into account two diﬀerent parts of
the total electric ﬁeld E(x, t) = Econ(x, t) + Eext(x, t) in eqns.(3-4), where Eext(x, t) is inconsistent external ﬁeld (its
inconsistency means that it is deﬁned by external source, not by plasma). In practice one usually transits from ﬁeld to
∂φext/∂x, and Econ must satisfy Poisson equation (5) and is deﬁned as self-consistent
potential according to Eext =
ﬁeld with boundary condition Econ(0, t).

In both cases one obtains the exponential growing solutions. But substitution of any exponential growing expression
of the form exp(iωt + ikx) with complex values ω, k in eqns.(3)–(5) leads to a dispersion equation which has no
solutions4. It means that at the same extent as taking into account the boundary condition E(0, t) one must also
for the sake of consistency with E(0, t) take into account initial and boundary values of functions f (1e) (x, t, ~v),
f (1i) (x, t, ~v), in such a way that growing terms be cancelled (as it has been already noted in4).

The possibility of such cancellation is provided with the same poles of growing solutions for Ep1p2 and Laplace

images of initial and boundary values of f (1e) and f (1i).

We have considered Vlasov diﬀerential equations for collisionless plasma and successfully solved them asymptotically

by the Laplace transform method of operational calculus.

We have proposed absolutely new, very simple and eﬀective way of ﬁnding plasma oscillation modes: they are deﬁned
by the pairs (ω(n), k(n)), n = 1, 2, . . ., which are determined as pairs of roots (“double-zeros”) of the “generalized
dispersion equation”

where Ep1p2 is two-dimensional (in x and t) Laplace image of self-consistent plasma electric ﬁeld E(x, t). Some
additional plasma density oscillation modes appear to be determined from

but really this has no place. According to the required mutual consistency of initial and boundary values of
f (1e) (x, t, ~v), f (1i) (x, t, ~v) with boundary ﬁeld E(0, t) (the solutions ﬁniteness condition) these additional oscilla-
tory modes must be connected with the electric ﬁeld, thus the coeﬃcients in the total sum of the modes have to be
proportional to E0.

The eqn.(29) is in principle diﬀerent from equation commonly used in literature (see, for instance, the classic

text-book exposition in7,8)

εl (ω, k) = 0 ,

where (according to the considered in this paper cases) εl is longitudinal dielectric susceptibility deﬁned by only the
intrinsic parameters of a homogeneous inﬁnite plasma. Contrary to this approach the function Ep1p2 accounts for
initial and boundary conditions concretely. The ﬁnding Ep1p2 , contrary to εl, does not require using Landau theory
with its doubtful foundations (using analytical continuation, expansions in asymptotically divergent series (see4,6),
problems with the principle of causality and so on). At the same time the equation (29) allows one, contrary to
(31), to ﬁnd all the oscillation modes in a given concrete problem. It reveals immediately the tight interconnection
of oscillatory modes with the concrete conditions, that is with methods of excitation, excitation frequency, functional
forms of initial and boundary conditions, whereas eqn.(31) connects plasma oscillations and waves only with proper
intrinsic parameters of plasma.

Moreover, the required connection of initial and boundary conditions means that it is impossible completely to
discriminate between a pure boundary or pure initial problems. So, to ﬁnd the ﬁnite solution of a “boundary” problem
it is certainly required to supply also non-zero initial values of distribution functions f (1) under consideration.

It should be emphasized once again that in general case using the theory of plasma oscillations, based on suscep-
tibility ǫ and plasma modes equation ǫ = 0, either is erroneous (because it is based on the dispersion equation which
does not exist) or has rather limited range of applicability.

In this paper we have considered only the simplest examples of application of suggested method. Besides of diverse
generalizations one of the main problems here stays the account for Coulomb collisions, which requires cumbersome
mathematical computations with revision of results described in literature (see, for instance,6) and based mainly on
expansions in asymptotically divergent series in small parameter δ/ω0.

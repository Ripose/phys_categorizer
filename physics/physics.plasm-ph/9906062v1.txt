1 Abstract

Interaction of external monochromatic, linearly polorized plane EM-wave
with nonlinear one-dimensional wake wave, generated by relativistic electron
bunch moving in cold plasma, is considered.

At deﬁnite conditions on parameters of plasma and bunch, nonlinear wake
wave can have a pronounced spikes, where plasma electron density has its
maximum value and plasma electron velocities are nearing wave breaking
limit, i.e. velocity of the rigid driving bunch [1]-[5]. Presented calculations
show, that external EM-wave, propagating through plasma, normal to the
bunch velocity, at such a conditions can be ampliﬁed inside the spikes, due
to interaction with the plasma electrons. EM-wave, Thomson scattered on
spikes, is also ampliﬁed. Ampliﬁcation factors are obtained for the both
cases at diﬀerent conditions on EM-wave-plasma-electron bunch system pa-
rameters. An additional ampliﬁcation takes place, when the frequency of
EM-wave is nearing to the spike plasma frequency.

Results are obtained in the perturbative approach, when dimensionless
external EM-wave amplitude is used as a small parameter. The exact one-
dimensional solution of the problem of nonlinear wake wave generation in
cold plasma by relativistic electron bunch, obtained previously in [4], [5], is
taken as a zero order approximation.

2 Introduction

The problem of interaction of external electromagnetic wave (EM-wave) with
electrons or electron bunches, moving in plasma, and with plasma wake

1

waves, generated by these electron beams, have been a subject of numer-
ous investigations [6]-[10].
It was assumed that driving electrons or elec-
tron bunches are nonrelativistic, generated plasma wake waves are linear and
physical problems studied in [6]-[10] have been devoted to electron ionization
losses and electron acceleration.

Plasma - relativistic electron bunch RF - generators have been proposed
in [11] and experimentally investigated in number of works (see reviews [12]
- [14]). Nonlinear Thomson scattering of intense laser pulses from plasmas
was considered in [15].

In the present work considered plasma wake waves are essentialy nonlin-
ear, generated by relativistic rigid electron bunches and external EM-wave
is weak enough in order to provide the possibility to use the perturbative
approach. The goal of present investigation is to ﬁnd out the possibility and
conditions, when external EM-wave can be ampliﬁed inside the plasma as
well as Thomson scattered EM-wave. Main diﬀerence from previous inves-
tigations consists in consideration the generated plasma waves, which are
near the wave breaking limit. It is shown that if some conditions near to
wake wave breaking limit are satisﬁed, the essential ampliﬁcations in both
considered cases can take place.

The breaking of waves is one of the most impressive phenomena, where
eﬀect of nonlinearities stands out of clearly. Plasma wave breaking was pre-
dicted in the works of Akhieser and Polovin [1] and Dawson [2] (see also
[3]). The connection of the parameters of plasma wake wave breaking limit
with the parameters of plasma and driving relativistic electron bunch in one-
dimensional approach have been obtained in [4], [5].

Recently, the variety of nonlinear plasma wave-breaking was considered in
the frame of laser wake ﬁeld acceleration (LWFA) concept (see e.g. [16]-[18]).
Wake wave breaking has followed the so called ”blow out” regime, [19] intro-
duced in the frame of plasma wake ﬁeld acceleration (PWFA) concept (see
also review [18]). As it will be seen from the presented results, wake waves
near wavebreaking limit can also be used for EM-wave ampliﬁcation with pos-
sible application to desigh the powerful klystron type EM-wave ampliﬁers or
generators for future linear colliders with high acceleration gradient.

3 Formulation of the Problem and Basic Equa-

tions

Consider ﬂat electron bunch, moving in cold plasma, along z-direction with
the velocity v0 in lab system. Longitudinal length of the bunch is d, trans-
verse dimensions of the bunch are taken inﬁnite, i.e. the problem can be
treated, in the absence of external electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld, as one dimen-
sional. Bunch is placed at the moment of time t = 0 in interval 0

ions are considered as immobile, plasma electron density at equilibrium is

cold plasma. The back inﬂuence of plasma wake wave on the bunch [21] as
well as bunch interaction with external EM - wave are disregarded, due to
assumption than driving bunch is relativistic enough.

It is assumed also, that considered plasma column has a thickness

along the direction of EM - wave propagation (0x - axis), which is smaller
than corresponding skin length of plasma

5 Conclusion

The obtained analytical estimates demonstrate, that at certain conditions
on cold plasma - relativistic electron bunch - external EM - wave system
parameters (see (30), (33), (59)), essentialy large ampliﬁcation of electric
ﬁeld inside the plasma spikes, as well as intensity of Thomson scattered on
spikes EM - wave, are existed (see expression for ampliﬁcation factors (38),
(43), (46), (57), (58), (59)). Presented results could be used in research
and development of powerful klystron type ampliﬁers and generators of high
frequency EM - waves for future linear colliders.

The presented in the work estimates have at some extent qualitative char-
acter and must be complemented by more quantative investigations, presum-
ably by computer simulations. The reason for computer calculations is evi-
dent from the fact, that even in perturbative approach, addopted in present
work, the problem is reduced, due to nonlinearity of zero order approxi-
mation, to the set of quasilinear equations (11), with variable coeﬁcients,
nonlinearly depending on argument ˜z. The exact analytical solution of the
set of equations (11) is practicaly impossible to obtain.

However, more elaborate perturbative approach, for example based on
multiple scales method, could provide the possibility to go further in direc-
tions outlined in the present work.

In order to ﬁnd out the optimal geometry for experimental detection of the
predicted EM - wave ampliﬁcation, it is necessary to consider also diﬀerent
directions of propagation and diﬀerent polarizations of external EM - wave.

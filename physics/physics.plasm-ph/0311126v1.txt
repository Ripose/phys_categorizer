Abstract

The theory of electron holes is extended into the quantum regime. The Wigner–Poisson system is solved

perturbatively based in lowest order on a weak, standing electron hole. Quantum corrections are shown to

lower the potential amplitude and to increase the number of deeply trapped electrons. They, hence, tend

to bring this extreme non–equilibrium state closer to thermodynamic equilibrium, an eﬀect which can be

attributed to the tunneling of particles in this mixed state system.

Quantum plasmas[1] have recently attracted considerable attention. Non–ideal, dense plasmas

generated e.g. in the ultraintense laser–solid interaction certainly belong to this category. However,

also ideal, dilute plasmas –the addressee of this letter– can exhibit a quantum behavior. One reason

is that the miniaturization of today’s micro- and nano-electronic components has reached a level

such that the system length becomes comparable with the de Broglie wavelength, in which case

tunneling eﬀects are no longer negligible [2]. Also, states in combined traps attained by particles

and their anti–particles used to form anti–hydrogen may be modelled by a plasma having quantum

features [3]. Other examples can easily be found, and some of them will be mentioned further

below. Hence, classical transport models will unlikely be suﬃcient to describe the plasma behavior

in such devices adequately. Generally the main focus in this respect is the collective charge carrier

transport which has been shown [4] to be increased by the presence of coherent structures such

as hollow phase space vortices [5]. The latter are also called holes in plasma physics [4, 5, 6, 7]

because of their associated density depression exhibiting a remarkable robustness and stability [8].

Before studying the quantum corrections to such holes let us review some further dilute many

particle systems and related disciplines that reveal quantum aspects. Charged–particle beams

in particle accelerators are typically dilute systems, so quantum eﬀects are usually disregarded.

However, a spectrum of phenomena, which recently became more and more important, reveals

the existence of several quantum aspects of beam physics connecting the physics of particle ac-

celerator with the frontiers of several disciplines, such as (for instance) plasma physics, radiation

beam physics, astrophysics, mesoscopic and condensate physics [9, 10]. Most of these phenomena

introduce a sort of quantum correction to the leading classical behavior of the system. For exam-

ple, quantum excitation [11] plays a role for the long–term stability of longitudinal electron beam

dynamics in the high–energy circular accelerating machines while the Sokolev–Ternov eﬀect [12]

of spin polarization of electron and proton beams is a manifestation, at the macroscopic level, of

the single quantum nature of the beam particles. Numerical phase space investigations based on

tracking with the quantum map have shown that quantum corrections can substantially aﬀect the

particle beam trajectories in the vicinity of the separatrix [13].

Recently quantumlike methodologies [14] have been applied to a number of classical physical

situations, in which ¯h is replaced by another characteristic parameter of the problem considered.

For instance, they have been applied to accelerator physics [15], to plasma physics [16], to surface

gravity wave physics [17] and to nonlinear optics [18] in an attempt to describe linear and nonlinear

problems of the dynamics of beams and large amplitude wavepackets.

In principle, all these problems can be formulated, in the conﬁguration space, in terms of

2

a system of Zacharov equations, i.e. nonlinear Schr¨odinger–like equation coupled with one (or

more) equation(s) taking into account the reaction of the environment. The corresponding phase

space description is the one provided by the Wigner–Moyal quasidistribution [19] whose evolution

equation, the von Neumann equation, plays the role of a kinetic–like equation associated with the

system.

Analytically, the framework under which Wigner–Moyal quasidistributions have been mostly

considered so far is that of particles interacting with a given external e.g. parabolic potential

to analyze coherent and squeezed states. Furthermore, a quantum-like phase space analysis of a

paraxial–charged–particle beam transport, travelling through a quadrupole-like device with small

sextupole and octupole aberrations, has been carried out showing a satisfactory agreement with

the results of the standard tracking simulations [20] and, consequently, the suitability of using the

quantum phase–space formalism in particle accelerators. This has been done within the framework

of the thermal wave model [15]. Quantum-like corrections involved in the von Neumann equation

have been discussed for paraxial beams of both particles and radiation and compared with the

standard classical description [21].

Particles in quantum plasmas moving in their own, self–consistent potential, on the other hand,

have not been given much attention so far. An exception are self–consistent but linearized solutions

of the Wigner–Poisson system, dealing with quantum corrections to Landau damping of Langmuir

waves [22] or to the two–stream instability by means of the Nyquist method [23], and the self–

consistent linearized solution of the Wigner–Moyal kinetic–like equation for Langmuir wavepackets

coupled with the ion–acoustic wave equation [24]. In particular, the Wigner–Moyal kinetic–like

description is suitable for describing the Benjamin–Feir instability (modulational instability) as

well as predicting the stabilizing eﬀect of a sort of Landau damping. It is well known that the

latter cannot be shown in conﬁguration space, where the the system is usually described by the

Zakharov equations. By using the pure state formalism, a Landau–type damping has been shown

for the longitudinal dynamics of both charged–particle coasting beams and e.m. wavetrains in

high–energy circular accelerators and nonlinear media, respectively [25]. A similar approach has

been extended (mixed state formalism) to ensembles of partially–incoherent waves in diﬀerent

physical situations [24, 26, 27].

The aim of this paper is to describe an electron–ion unmagnetized plasma, in which, on the

basis of the experimental evidences as well as on theoretical and numerical investigations mentioned

above, the quantum nature of the particles is not disregarded. However, it is taken into account

only as a weak (perturbative) eﬀect in comparison to the leading classical behavior of the system.

3

Together with the weak quantum eﬀect, we take into account the usual classical electrostatic

collective plasma eﬀects coming from the standard meanﬁeld approximation of the coulombian

interaction, in such a way that our system is described by a set of coupled equation comprising the

von Neumann equation for the Wigner–Moyal quasidistribution and Poisson’s equation. Hereafter,

we will refer to this system of equations as WP–system (Wigner–Poisson system). Our goal is to ﬁnd

a self consistent solution of the WP–system to the lowest order of the quantum correction. Before

formulating our problem in detail, it is worth mentioning some further considerations starting from

the classical case.

Classically, electron and ion holes are nonlinear, stationary solutions of the Vlasov–Poisson

system (VP–system) being omnipresent structures in many driven, collisionless plasmas. They are

found in one or other variant in the laboratory [7, 28, 29], in particle accelerators [30, 31], in the

laser–plasma interaction [32] and in the extraterrestrial space [33]. Analytical solutions, applicable

to kinetic hole structures found in particle accelerators, have been presented in [34].

Generally speaking, the fundamental role of holes arises from the fact that they can nonlinearly

destabilize a plasma even in linearly stable situations, namely if they posses a negative energy

character [35, 36]. There is hence accrued interest to extend the studies of holes into the quantum

domain, which means that the WP–system has to be employed instead.

In recent numerical studies [37] a multistream model for a current–driven quantum plasma

has been applied. Signatures of coherent hole structures appear in the simulation of a statistical

mixture of many pure states, with each wave function obeying the Schr¨odinger–Poisson system.

That this system is equivalent to the mixed state WP–system has been shown in [38]. To the best

of our knowledge, an analytic self–consistent nonlinear solution of the WP–system is still missing

in the literature.

In this letter we present a ﬁrst rigorous nonlinear self–consistent solution of the WP–system

assuming weak nonlinearity and proximity to the classical VP–system. First we shall refer to the

classical e–hole and then study quantum corrections, for which a self–consistent solution is derived.

We are ﬁrst investigating a standing, classical e–hole which is the simplest inhomogeneous

stationary solution of the VP–system for a plasma with immobile ions:

density are normalized by the electron Debye length λD = (kTe/4πn0e2)1/2, the electron thermal
velocity vth = (kTe/me)1/2 and the homogeneous electron density, n0, where me is the mass of the

electrons and Te is their temperature.

In thermal equilibrium, the plasma adopts a homogeneous state with a Maxwellian distribution

reduces to fM as φ

0. The electron density in the weak amplitude regime can be written as a

half power expansion of φ [5, 39],

It has to fulﬁll two necessary conditions: (a) V (φ) < 0 in 0 < φ < ψ and (b) V (ψ) = 0, where

On the other hand, equation (4) allows us to integrate Poisson’s equation (1b), and we obtain the

bell–shaped electrostatic potential:

φ(x) = ψsech4

x

.

(cid:16)

Note that other electrostatic structures such as propagating electron holes, ion holes or periodic

nonlinear waves (cnoidal waves) can also be found by appropriate extensions of this method [5, 6,

39].

To study quantum corrections, we start with Wigner’s quasidistribution which satisﬁes the time

independent von Neumann or quantum Liouville equation[19]:

Assuming that ε is small, i.e. the quantum eﬀects appear only as corrections to the classical

solution, we can perform a power expansion of the potential operator φ

x

which we insert

iε
2 ∂v

±

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

into (6). All even terms cancel out and we get up to the third order

v∂xf + φ′(x)∂vf

φ′′′(x)∂3

v f = 0,

ε2
3!4

−

which is the equation we have to couple with (1b).

As we keep terms up to O(ε2), we will look for corrections of the same order in the potential

and in the distribution function, f = f0 + ε2f1, φ = φ0 + ε2φ1, with f0 and φ0 representing now
(2) and (5) respectively. Inserting this ansatz into (7) and (1b) neglecting again terms of O(ε4) we

ﬁnd

By deﬁning g(x, v) := f1 + φ1∂Ef0, we can reduce equations (8a) and (8b) to the somewhat

simpler system

v∂x + φ′0(x)∂v

φ′1(x)∂vf0 +

Now it is convenient to switch into a new set of variables deﬁned by ξ = x, E = v2

φ0(x),

2 −

σ = sg(v) and rewrite h(x, v) = H(ξ, E, σ), g(x, v) = G(ξ, E, σ). With these variables, (9a)

becomes ∂ξG(ξ, E, σ) = H(ξ, E, σ)/v(ξ, E, σ), whose general solution is

G(ξ, E, σ) = G(0, E, σ) +

ξ

H(ξ′, E, σ)
v(ξ′, E, σ)

,

where v(ξ, E, σ) = σ

2 [E + φ0(ξ)]. Therefore, in order to ﬁnd G we only have to integrate

H(ξ, E, σ)/v(ξ, E, σ) along the classical particle trajectories given by E = const.. In this expression

p

we have chosen the lower integration limit as ξ = 0 because this is the only point which is reached

by all trajectories (see below). Note that a trapped particle will move along a closed, bounded

trajectory around the origin in phase space.

by diﬀerentiation

For positive energies, we can follow the trajectories up to any ξ in (10) and, assuming that the

correction vanishes at ξ

, we arrive at

dξ′ φ′′′0 (ξ′)Ω(ξ′, E).

(12)

Note that this expression does no longer depend on σ. For negative energies G(0, E, σ) is not

determined by such a procedure but, due to the symmetry of the problem we can assume that it

will also be σ–independent. On the other side, we can always extend the integration of (10) to

for negative energies also as long as we change the integration constant. Therefore we have,

−∞
for any E,

G(ξ, E, σ) = G(ξ, E) :=

dξ′ φ′′′0 (ξ′)Ω(ξ′, E)
(cid:21)

,

(13)

with G0(E) = 0 for E > 0.

Note that ∂Ef0 is discontinuous at E = 0. Therefore, G(ξ, E) does not have a deﬁnite value at

the separatrix. Our approach will be to solve (9) for positive and negative energies separately and

then put both solutions together imposing the continuity of f1 at the separatrix.

In order to integrate (13), we consider these two diﬀerent cases:

1. For E > 0 we have G0(E) = 0 and Ω(ξ, E) = [3

2(E + φ0(ξ))] e−

E. The integral (13) can

2. If E < 0 we must

The continuity of f1 is now imposed to determine G0(E). As f1 = g

φ1∂Ef0, the discontinuity

of g(x, v) = G(ξ, E), namely ∆G := G(ξ, 0+)

G(ξ, 0−) should be equal to φ1∆(∂Ef0). Since it

holds ∆(∂Ef0) = (β

Then we can ﬁnd φ1(ξ) as φ1(ξ) = ∆G/∆(∂E f0) = √2π∆G/(β

Moreover, as we impose φ1(

) = 0, we know that G0(0) = 0. Hence, we obtain φ1(ξ). Figure

1a shows φ1(ξ) for ψ = 0.1 and Fig. 1b represents the corrected potential. For reference, also the

unperturbed potential is drawn. We see that the potential experiences a reduction as a result of

quantum correction.

function f = f0 + ε2f1 is represented at ﬁxed x in Fig. 3.

We clearly recognize a partial ﬁlling of the phase space within the separatrix being maximum at

the hole center. An interpretation may be given in terms of refraction or tunneling: in the classical

solution nearby its separatrix, the region of untrapped electrons is populated stronger than that of

trapped electrons. In the quantum domain when tunneling becomes eﬀective this gives rise to a net

inﬂux of particles resulting in a less dilute distribution of trapped electrons. This interpretation

of the collective particle behavior,found analytically,matches well with the numerical ﬁndings of

Ref. 13, according to which the quantum corrections aﬀect the particle trajectories in the vicinity

of the separatrix (see also Ref. 20).

We, therefore, conclude that the overall eﬀect of a quantum correction to a classical e–hole is

the tendency of the system to reduce the coherent excitation by both a diminution of the amplitude

and a partial ﬁlling of the trapped particle region by refraction (tunneling), bringing the system

closer to the thermal state.

Open questions are how these semiclassical corrections are modiﬁed in case of ﬁnite amplitudes

The evolution of piecewise constant distributions of a conserved quantity related to the frozen-in
canonical vorticity in eﬀectively two-dimensional incompressible ideal EMHD ﬂows is analytically
investigated by the Hamiltonian method. The study includes the case of axisymmetric ﬂows with
zero azimuthal velocity component and also the case of ﬂows with the helical symmetry of vortex
lines. For suﬃciently large size of such a patch of the conserved quantity, a local approximation
in the dynamics of the patch boundary is suggested, based on the possibility to represent the total
energy as the sum of area and boundary terms. Only the boundary energy produces deformation of
the shape with time. Stationary moving conﬁgurations are described.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we consider a special class of vortical
ﬂows in plasma that correspond to the model of ideal
electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD). In general, we
deal with ideal EMHD-ﬂows that are eﬀectively two-
dimensional (2D), namely with the usual planar ﬂows,
with the axisymmetric ﬂows having the only azimuthal
component of the magnetic ﬁeld, and with the ﬂows pos-
sessing the helical symmetry of frozen-in lines of the gen-
eralized vorticity. Such ﬂows are completely determined
by a single function of two spatial coordinates and the
time. Our purpose here is to introduce a simpliﬁed an-
alytical description adopted for the case when the func-
tion is piecewise constant (such distributions are usually
called “patches”), with a typical spatial scale between
well separated the electron inertial length and the ion in-
ertial length. These are the simplest examples of EMHD-
ﬂows with dissipationless current sheets, since near the
sharp boundary of the “patches” the density of the elec-
tric current is high. It is a well known fact that the role
of current sheets in plasma dynamics is very important,
that is why it is interesting to investigate these ﬂows.

As known, the EMHD model approximately describes
the motion of the low-inertial electron component of
plasma on suﬃciently short scales (below the ion iner-
tial length), while the much heavier ion component may
be considered as motionless (see, e.g., [1]). Conditions
for electrical quasi-neutrality of the plasma are assumed,
which imply that the macroscopic velocity v(r, t) of the
electron ﬂow should be suﬃciently small and also all
potential waves and oscillations of the plasma density
should not be excited. Only vortical degrees of freedom
of the system are relevant in such circumstances. With
these conditions, everywhere in the space the concentra-

tion n(r, t) of electrons is approximately equal to the pre-
scribed concentration N (r) of ions, thus the density of
n(r, t)v(r, t) is almost di-
ﬂow of the electrons j(r, t)
vergence free, divj
0. The role of ions is thus reduced
simply to compensation of the electric charge of electrons
by providing the static neutralizing background. Such
ﬂows of the electron ﬂuid create the divergence-free ﬁeld
of electric current density
e is the electron
charge. Hence, the quasi-stationary magnetic ﬁeld

Important for our consideration is that in some cases
dissipative eﬀects due to ﬁnite resistivity and/or viscos-
ity may be neglected without dramatic loss of accuracy.
So we study below the conservative EMHD model. A re-
markable feature of the conservative hydrodynamic-type
systems is that all of them possess an inﬁnite number of
integrals of motion related to a basic physical property of
ﬂuids, the relabeling symmetry (see, e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5] and
references therein for a recent discussion). This sym-
metry manifests itself as the freezing-in property of a
divergence-free vector ﬁeld (the canonical vorticity ﬁeld)

pressible ideal EMHD ﬂows having a special symmetry
which allows one to describe the vorticity distribution in

cases the evolution of the corresponding ω(u, v, t) is noth-
ing else but only the transport of its level contours by 2D
incompressible ﬂows. The general structure of the equa-
tions of motion for the function ω(u, v, t) is

the motion of the patches in (u, v)-plane for all three
kinds of the geometric symmetry. Wee will extensively
use the fact that in EMHD the kernels Gσ(u1, v1; u2, v2)
of the operators are exponentially small if the distances
between (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) are much longer than an in-
ternal length parameter of the problem, the inertial elec-
tron skin depth d = (mc2/4πe2n)1/2. For comparatively
large patches, this property makes possible to single out
the local boundary term in the Hamiltonian, which is re-
sponsible for the evolution of the patch shape, while the
main area term in the approximate local Hamiltonian
only results in a uniform motion of the patch without
changing the shape.

II. CANONICAL FORMALISM FOR EMHD

For convenience and self-consistency, now we repro-
duce brieﬂy derivation of the EMHD equations, following
the canonical formalism adopted for ﬂuids as described
in Refs. 3, 5. As the start point, let us consider the mi-
croscopic Lagrangian of a system of electrically charged
point particles that can be written up to the second order
on v/c, as it is given in the famous book by Landau and
Lifshitz [6],

where ra(t) are the positions of the point charges ea,
va(t)
˙ra(t) are their velocities, nab(t) are the unit vec-
tors in the direction between ea and eb. The ﬁrst double
sum in Eq.(13) corresponds to the electrostatic interac-
tion, while the second double sum describes the magnetic
interaction via quasi-stationary magnetic ﬁeld. It is very
important that for a system with macroscopically large
number of particles the magnetic energy can be of the
same order (or even larger) as the kinetic energy given
by the ﬁrst ordinary sum in Eq.(13), while the terms
of the fourth order on the velocities are often negligi-
ble. Generally speaking, a large part of plasma physics is
governed by this Lagrangian, at least in the cases when
the velocities of particles are non-relativistic and the free
electro-magnetic ﬁeld is not excited signiﬁcantly. Obvi-
ously, diﬀerent physical problems need diﬀerent proce-
dures of macroscopic consideration of this system. The
most accurate (and the most complicated) would be a
kinetic description. However, for our purposes it is suf-
ﬁcient to apply more simple and naive procedure of the
hydrodynamical averaging, that gives less accurate de-
scription of the system in terms of the concentration of
electrons n(r, t) and the density of their ﬂow j(r, t), that
satisfy the continuity equation

∂n
∂t

+ divj = 0.

(14)

Neglecting all dissipative processes that take place due to
collisions of the particles (though on this step we strongly
reduce applicability of the following conservative model),
and considering the ions as macroscopically motionless,
we derive from Eq.(13) the following Lagrangian func-
tional of the electron ﬂuid on the given static ion back-
ground with the macroscopic concentration N (r):

Hereafter we consider the case n = const and use di-
mensionless variables, with all length scales normalized

where λ =

the electron inertial length to the ion inertial length. It
should be noted that the EMHD model in this simplest
form, without taking into account the ion motion, is ap-
plicable only on scales below the ion inertial length. A
more accurate model diﬀers by another Green’s function
in the double integral (23): instead of the expression (24)
with eﬀectively ﬁnite radius of interaction, one has to use
the modiﬁed Green’s function, with inﬁnite radius of in-
teraction (see, e.g., [7] for more detail)

However, in this work we deal with the function (24),
since our goal is to construct a local approximate model.
Thus, a typical size ˜L of vortex structures must be in
the limits λ
1, in order the contribution to the
Hamiltonian from the second term in Eq.(25) to be small
in comparison with the contribution from the ﬁrst one.

we suppose the ﬂows isentropic.

Since we are interested below in relatively slow vortical
motion of the electron ﬂuid, when all possible potential
waves and oscillations are not excited signiﬁcantly, so the
quasi-neutrality condition n
N is well satisﬁed, it is
possible to neglect the second line in the expression (15),
as well as variation of ε(n). Thus, for the EMHD, which
describes this special dynamical limit of the system (15),
we have the Lagrangian

(1/2π)

Now we study stationary moving (along z-axis) con-

tions are presented in Fig.1 and Fig.2. Besides z-periodic
conﬁgurations (that correspond to axisymmetric current
channels with a sharp crimped surface), there exist ﬁnite
conﬁgurations (cross-sections of magnetic rings). For ﬁ-
nite conﬁgurations the curves must be closed, thus in this
case the integral (32) between the two corresponding ze-

a relation between a and b. Strictly speaking, only the
magnetic rings can satisfy the condition ˜L

IV. DISCUSSION

Thus, a local approximation for a class of eﬀectively
2D ﬂows in the ideal EMHD, based on the Hamiltonian
formulation of the problem, has been suggested for the
nonlinear contour dynamics. Stationary moving conﬁg-
urations with current sheets have been analytically (in
integral form) found within this approximation. They
describe propagation of magnetic rings, traveling waves
on a crimped surface of current channels, and rotating
helical magnetic structures. However, a payment for the
relative simplicity of our local models has been the gen-
eral impossibility to consider in such a manner short-scale
λ) contour perturbations, though their dynamics may
(
∼
have inﬂuence on the problem of stability of the station-
ary moving conﬁgurations. Also, the question about evo-
lution of 3D perturbations of the magnetic rings, current
channels, and/or helical structures cannot be answered
in such very simpliﬁed description of the ﬂows by mov-
ing curves in a plane. But we believe our approach useful
since it develops an insight in theoretical understanding
of such complicated nonlocal theory as the EMHD.

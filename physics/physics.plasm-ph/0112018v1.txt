Abstract

We show that moderate deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution
can increase deuterium reaction rates enough to contribute to the heating of Jupiter.
These deviations are compatible with the violation of extensivity expected from
temperature and density conditions inside Jupiter.

1 Introduction

Jupiter emits more radiation then it recives from the sun: the origin of this
excess heat is still uncertain and debated. Possible explanations are: release
of gravitational potential energy due to the planet contraction and/or Helium
sedimentation [1], decaying of radioactive isotopes in the core [2], or deuterium
burning [3]. Each of these hypotheses has diﬃculties [4]; in particular, standard
calculations of deuterium burning reaction rates predict negligible contribution
to the planet thermal balance, in spite of the substantial enhancement due to
electron and ion screening eﬀects [3,5].

In a strongly coupled plasma, anomalous diﬀusion and time correlation ef-
fects originate non-Maxwellian two-body relative energy distribution that can
be parameterized with and, in same cased, assume the same functional form
that appears in the contest of Tsallis non-extensive thermodynamics [6,7]. As
demonstrated for the solar core, small changes of the tail of the energy dis-
tribution can strongly modify the fusion rates without aﬀecting mechanical
properties (hydrostatic equilibrium and the sound speed) that depend on the
mean value of the distribution [8].

Since the internal conditions of Jupiter indicate the existence of a strongly
coupled plasma, we investigate the eﬀects of the consequent small deviations
from the standard Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) statistics on deuterium burning

the past, a role in Jupiter thermal balance.

Jupiter interior is a mixture of liquid metallic hydrogen and helium, with
density and temperature within the ranges: ρJ = 2

eV; during planet formation the central temperature should have been of the

3 Non-Maxwellian deuterium burning

Non extensive Thermodynamics, introduced by Tsallis [10] has been applied to
many diﬀerent ﬁelds. In particular, it has been observed [6,7] that small devia-
tions from Maxwellian distribution can be described by weakly non-extensive
Tsallis distributions, and that such deviations can have dramatic consequences
for nuclear reaction rates in the solar core [8].

We can calculate the eﬀects of non-extensivity on nuclear reaction rates by sub-
E/kT ), with the Tsallis
stituting the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, exp (

4 Discussion and conclusions

In Fig. 1 deuterium reaction rates are plotted for two diﬀerent values of the q
parameter. We can observe that moderate deviations (q
0.1 from the
Maxwellian distribution increase deuterium burning rates above the threshold

These considerations demonstrate that deuterium burning is a possible expla-
nation for the Jupiter excess heat. Precise determinations of the conditions
inside Jupiter and additional microscopic calculations are necessary for a bet-
ter determination of the range of values of q relevant to Jupiter interior.

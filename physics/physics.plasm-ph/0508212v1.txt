Small three-dimensional strongly coupled charged particles in a spherical conﬁnement potential
arrange themselves in a nested shell structure. By means of experiments, computer simulations and
theoretical analysis, it is shown that their structural properties depend on the type of interparticle
forces. Using an isotropic Yukawa interaction, quantitative agreement for shell radii and occupation
is obtained.

The recently discovered Coulomb balls [1] are an inter-
esting new object for studying strongly coupled systems.
Coulomb balls consist of hundreds of micrometer sized
plastic spheres embedded in a gas plasma. The plastic
spheres attain a high electric charge Q of the order of
several thousand elementary charges and arrange them-
selves into a highly ordered set of nested spherical shells
with hexagonal order inside the shells. Coulomb balls
are a special form of 3D-plasma crystals [2, 3, 4]. The
formation of ordered clusters with nested shells was also
observed in laser-cooled trapped ion systems, e.g. [5, 6],
and is expected to occur in expanding neutral plasmas
[7, 8].

The same kind of ordering was found in molecular dy-
namics (MD) simulations, e.g. [9, 10, 11] and references
therein. In particular, the transition to the macroscopic
limit [12, 13], the symmetry properties of the individual
shells including a Voronoi analysis [10] and metastable in-
trashell conﬁgurations [11, 14] have been analyzed. Very
large systems of trapped ions show a transition to the
crystal structure of bulk material, which was measured
by laser scattering [15].

Although the shell structure of ion crystals is quite
well understood in terms of simulation results, these sys-
tems do not yet allow for systematic experimental studies
of the structure inside the shells and the detailed occu-
pation numbers of individual shells. The advantage of
studying Coulomb balls is the immediate access to the
full three-dimensional structure of the nested shell sys-
tem by means of video microscopy. The tracing of each
individual particle is ensured by the high optical trans-
parency of the system, which results from particle diam-
eters of typically 5 µm at interparticle spacings of 500
µm. Compared to atomic particles, the very high mass
of the microparticles used here slows down all dynamic
phenomena to time scales ranging from 10 ms to sec-
onds. Therefore, studies of Coulomb balls complement
investigations of ion crystals, where dynamical studies
are diﬃcult.

is the mean interparticle distance, attains large values
(Γ
100). Contrary to ion crystals, where the parti-
cles interact via the pure Coulomb force, the micropar-
ticles in a Coulomb ball are expected to interact by a
Yukawa type potential, Vdd = Q e−rλD /r, which was ver-
iﬁed experimentally in complex plasmas [16]. Therefore,
Coulomb balls are characterized by two parameters, the
coupling parameter Γ and the Debye shielding length of
the plasma λD. It is the intention of this paper to study
the inﬂuence of shielding on the structure of Coulomb
balls, in particular, to pin down the diﬀerences from sys-
tems with pure Coulomb interaction. This will be done
by comparing computer simulations with experimental
results. At the same time, a study of spherical crys-
tals with Yukawa interaction opens up an interesting new
ﬁeld which in a natural way bridges the gap between the
above mentioned theoretical investigations of ﬁnite size
Coulomb systems and the theory of macroscopic Yukawa
plasmas, e.g. [17, 18].

Experiment. The experiment is described in detail in
Refs. [1, 14, 19], so here we only summarize the main re-
sults from a systematic investigation of 43 Coulomb balls
consisting of 100 to 500 particles. All Coulomb balls were
trapped under identical experimental conditions. All of
them had a spherical shape and their diameter was in
the range of 4-5 mm. A typical experimental result for
a cluster and its shell structure is shown in the left part
of Fig. 1. In all 43 Coulomb balls a similar shell struc-
ture was observed and the shell radii Rs and the shell
occupation numbers Ns were measured. Further, from
the pair correlation function the typical mean interpar-
ticle distance was derived, which for all N was close to
0.6 mm. The mean intershell distance d was found
a
to be d = (0.86
0.82
in good agreement with local icosahedral ordering [9].
An important experimental result is that the intershell
distance is constant over the whole Coulomb ball and
implies a constant average density of particles and ions,
which is equivalent to a parabolic electric potential well
used for the simulations below. A more detailed experi-
mental veriﬁcation of the parabolic conﬁnement well will
be described elsewhere [19]. A diﬀerent case with ’self-
conﬁnement’ of a dust cloud in a strongly anharmonic
potential was recently discussed in [20].

We assume that the Coulomb balls consist of particles
with same mass and charge and that a stationary state
is reached close to thermodynamic equilibrium. Further-
more, the observed isotropic particle conﬁguration sug-
gests to use an isotropic interaction potential. Screen-
ing eﬀects are included in static approximation using
Debye(Yukawa)-type pair potentials Vdd given above. In
the simulations we use dimensionless parameters, with
lengths given in units of the ground state distance of
two particles, r0c, deﬁned in Eq. (2), hence in this paper
κ = r0c/λD. In experimental papers, κ = a/λD is often
used.
In accordance with the experiment on Coulomb
balls [19] and previous experiments and simulations on
ion crystals [17], we use a screening-independent conﬁne-
ment potential Uc(r) = mω2
r2/2. As a result, in our
model the conﬁguration of the Coulomb balls is deter-
mined by three parameters: particle number N , screen-
ing parameter κ and temperature T . Since experimen-
tal plasma densities and temperatures are not precisely
known, we have performed a series of calculations for dif-
ferent values of κ and T . Furthermore, a wide range of
particle numbers, up to N = 503, has been analyzed.

Results. Consider ﬁrst the theoretical ground state
conﬁgurations (T = 0) in the case of Coulomb interac-
tion, κ = 0, which were obtained by classical MD simula-
tions using an optimized simulated annealing technique
[11]. Using about 1000 independent runs for each value of
N ensured that the ground state is reached. In addition,
we have performed MC simulations in the canonic ensem-
ble with a standard Metropolis algorithm, which allows
for a rigorous account of ﬁnite temperature eﬀects. Both
simulations yield identical conﬁgurations at low temper-
ature. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of MD simulation and
experiment for the case of N = 190 particles. In both

For a more detailed quantitative comparison between
experiment and simulation we analyze the dependence of
the shell radii Rs on the cluster size N (Fig. 2). The
interparticle distance a serves as a common length scale
as it is accessible in experiment and simulation. There
N 1/3 of the experimental Rs for
is an overall increase
all shells and all 43 analyzed clusters. Exceptions occur
around values of N where new shells emerge. The same
behaviour is obtained from the MD simulations. Without
any free parameter a very good agreement of experimen-
tal radii and Coulomb MD results (full lines) is observed,
in particular concerning the absolute values, the slope
and the equidistance of the shells. Further, this results
holds even in case of a Yukawa potential if κ is small
(dashed lines in Fig. 2). These ﬁndings already imply
two things: First, the approach to use an screening in-
dependent parabolic conﬁnement potential to model the
experiments is justiﬁed. This is a marked diﬀerence from
a situation with self-conﬁnement, which does not yield
equidistant shells [20]. Second, the general scaling of the
N 1/3 is the
shell radii of weakly shielded Coulomb balls
same as for pure Coulomb systems, such as ion crystals.
However, a marked diﬀerence between experiment and
simulations of pure Coulomb systems is observed for the
shell population numbers N1 . . . N4. Table I shows the
shell population numbers for various screening param-
eter κ of a Coulomb ball with N = 190 as obtained
from MD simulations and experiment. Clearly, the MD
results yield systematically more particles in the outer
part of the cluster for κ = 0 than observed in exper-
iment. Further, Tab. I shows that, with increasing κ,
particles move from the outer shell inward. Interestingly,
for κ = 0.58 . . . 0.63, the simulations yield exactly the
same shell conﬁguration as the experiment. Hence, the
diﬀerent population numbers may be attributed to the
inﬂuence of screening and hence weakening of the inter-
action potential.

∝

To investigate this in more detail, this comparison was

extended to all 43 Coulomb balls. Due to their dif-
ferent size and even diﬀerent number of shells the sys-
tematic diﬀerences in shell population of Coulomb and
Yukawa systems can be studied comparing the experi-
mental results and systematic MD-simulations. The re-
sult is shown in Fig. 3. For all systems Coulomb, Yukawa
as well as the experimental data the shell population of
all shells shows an almost linear behavior as a function of
N 2/3. However, the experimentally obtained shell pop-
ulation of the outermost shell N4 is always smaller than
those of a Coulomb system (solid line) and the inner
shells show a systematically higher population. From the
Yukawa MD-simulations (dashed lines) this tendency is
conﬁrmed. It is clearly found that particles move to in-
ner shells with increasing κ. Hence, the ﬁnding discussed
for the Coulomb balls with N = 190 in Tab. I holds
generally. This tendency reﬂects the fact that, from an
energetic point of view, the higher population of inner
shell becomes less costly due the shielding than the oc-
cupation of the outermost shell, where the conﬁnement
by the trap dominates the potential energy.

In more detail, we ﬁnd that the outermost shell ex-
hibits the largest absolute change with κ and, there-
it is best suited for a detailed comparison with
fore,
the experimental data, see Fig. 3. From a best ﬁt to
the experimental data, we ﬁnd a screening parameter

the third shells,
other shells conﬁrms this result, e.g.
yield κEXP = 0.58
0.43. Determining the mean inter-
particle distance a from the ﬁrst peak of the pair distri-
bution function κEXP translates into an average Debye
length λD/a = 1.54
0.7. Furthermore, as one can see
in the right hand part of Fig. 1, an increase of κ leads
to compression of the entire cluster, which is due to the
reduction of the potential Vdd. The fact that more and
more particles move from the outer shells inward has the

consequence that closed shell conﬁgurations are already
reached for a smaller number N ∗ of total particles com-
pared to N ∗
c in the Coulomb case. While for κ = 0, the
ﬁrst closed shell is found at 12 particles, for κ & 4.7 the
ground state of a cluster with 12 (and 11 as well) par-
ticles contains one particle in the center and N ∗ = 10.

After analyzing the shell populations we now consider
the shell width. The larger roughness of the shells in the
experiments, cf. Fig. 1, is attributed to small anisotropies
of the experimental conﬁnement and ﬁnite depth resolu-
tion of the imaging equipment as well as temperature
eﬀects. While the measurements are at room tempera-
ture, the simulations refer to T = 0. Therefore we have
analyzed the inﬂuence of temperature on the shell radii
and populations with the help of MC simulations. From
the results we conclude that the eﬀect of temperature on
the shell conﬁgurations Ns is negligible for κ = 0.6. At
constant ﬁnite T we ﬁnd that an increase of κ leads to
a reduction of shell roughness. Contrary to that, a tem-
perature increase at elsewhere ﬁxed parameters in fact
leads to a roughening of the shells proportional to √T
for the outer shell and an even stronger eﬀect for the in-
ner shells. This tendency will become evident from the
analytical results below.

Analytical results. The main inﬂuence of screening on
Coulomb balls is readily understood with the help of an-
alytical results, which can be found for N = 2. First, the
ground state distance r0(κ) follows from minimizing the
potential energy U in Eq. (1):

Eq. (2) yields the two-particle distance, roc, in an un-
screened system as a function of r0 and is easily inverted
numerically [21]. The ratio r0/r0c is always smaller than
unity and monotonically decreasing with κ, thereby con-
ﬁrming the above observation of screening-induced com-
pression of the Coulomb balls. Second, we analyze the
cluster stability by expanding the potential U in terms of

which allows us to estimate the width of the Coulomb
ball shells. Finally, we compute the variance of the par-
ticle distance ﬂuctuations, σr, for particles in a parabolic
potential with frequency Ω at temperature T and ob-
r = 4kBT /(mΩ2). This allows for two interesting
tain σ2
conclusions, which explain the above MC results: At con-
stant screening, the shell width grows with temperature
as √T while screening reduces the shell width. One might
be tempted to conclude that increased screening makes
particle transitions between neighboring shells less likely
and thus stabilizes the cluster against melting. However,
the opposite is true, because screening also reduces the
distance between shells which is of the order of r0. The
relative importance of both tendencies can be discussed
in terms of the relative distance ﬂuctuations, a critical
value of which determines the onset of radial melting
(Lindemann criterion).

ur is related to an eﬀective coupling parameter, Γ∗
2 which
depends on the interaction strength of two trapped par-
ticles – via the Coulomb-type coupling parameter, Γ2
≡
Q2/(kBT r0), and on the screening strength – via the
function f2(κ). f2 monotonically decreases with κ (ur in-
creases), thus screening always destabilizes the Coulomb
balls.

Finally, these analytical results are closely related to
those for macroscopic homogeneous Yukawa systems, e.g.
[17, 18]. This limit is recovered by replacing, in (3), r0
by the mean interparticle distance a at a given density n,

the case of screening, the result is modiﬁed by a factor

2 is

in full analogy to the macroscopic result [18].

In summary, we have presented a combined experimen-
tal, numerical and theoretical analysis of small spheri-
cal charged particle clusters. The excellent experimen-
tal accessibility of these systems has been demonstrated.
The structure of these clusters deviates from models
with pure Coulomb interaction and requires the inclu-
sion of static screening. For the particle number range
N = 100 . . . 500, comparison with the MD and MC sim-
ulations has allowed us to determine the screening pa-
1.5. These
rameter averaged over the clusters as λD/a
Coulomb balls are representative for ﬁnite Yukawa sys-
tems, combining shell properties observed in spherical
Coulomb clusters with screening eﬀects found in Yukawa
plasmas. Since the shell occupation numbers have now
been critically analyzed, our results conﬁrm earlier con-
clusions about the shell structure of ion clusters, where
such an analysis was not accessible yet. The results are
relevant for other strongly correlated charged particle
systems, such as crystal formation of droplets in expand-
ing laser produced plasmas, where shielding becomes im-
portant.

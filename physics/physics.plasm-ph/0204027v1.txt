We demonstrate a 13-fold increase in hard x-ray bremsstrahlung (10 - 200 keV) emitted by a
−2. This enhancement is
copper plasma created by 100 fs, 806 nm pulses at 1014 − 1015 Wcm
achieved by roughening the surface with copper nanoparticles of 15 nm size. A simple model that
invokes local ﬁeld modiﬁcations by surface plasmon excitation and ‘lightning rod’ eﬀects explains
the observed enhancement quantitatively and provides pointers to the design of structured surfaces
for maximizing the emission.

The interaction of intense, ultrashort laser pulses with
solid plasmas is of immense interest not only from a ba-
sic physics point of view but also due to their promise as
micron-sized sources of ultrashort x-rays [1], in areas like
lithography and time resolved diﬀraction [1, 2]. Meth-
ods to enhance the x-ray yield are of great importance,
and the inﬂuence of various laser and target conditions
is widely being investigated. Pre-formed plasmas [3, 4]
yield signiﬁcant enhancements at the cost of an increase
in the x-ray pulse duration. Recent literature reports im-
pressive enhancements in soft [5] and moderately hard
x-ray regions [6] using structured surfaces, viz. grat-
ings [5, 7], “velvet” coatings [8], porous and nanocylinder
[4, 9] targets. However, little attention has been paid to
examine ways of improving the very hard (> 10 keV) x-
ray yield. The hard x-ray bremsstrahlung in this regime,
is emitted by hot electrons created in the plasma mainly
via the resonance absorption (RA) mechanism which is
induced by p-polarized light, incident obliquely to the
target normal [10]. Enhanced bremsstrahlung, therefore,
implies enhanced hot electron production, an issue that
is of immense interest to the fusion research community
[11].

In this letter, we demonstrate a method to enhance
hard x-ray bremsstrahlung by coating nanoparticles(NP)
on optically smooth metal targets. We report a 13-fold
enhancement in the 10-200 keV range using copper NP
coated targets. Further, we show that the NP coated tar-
gets give hotter electrons in comparison to the smooth
targets. These results are well explained by a simple
model that invokes local electric ﬁeld enhancement via
surface plasmon excitation and ‘lightning rod’ eﬀects. In
addition, this model provides clear guidelines to the de-
sign of surface microstructures that would maximize the
hot electron and x-ray yields. The giant enhancement in
nonlinearity that such fractal structures provide [12] and
the ease of patterning such targets can prove extremely
utile in the design of eﬃcient ultrashort x-ray sources.

laser

Our Ti:Sapphire

system generates 100 fs
(FWHM) pulses with 5 mJ energy per pulse. The pulses
have a contrast of 105 with the pedestal. A detailed
description of the experimental set-up can be found else-
where [13]. P-polarized laser pulses are focused with 25
and 30 cm focal length lenses on targets housed in a vac-
uum chamber at 10−3 Torr. A laser pulse of 1.0 mJ
yields peak intensity 1.3 × 1015 Wcm−2 at a typical fo-
cal spot size of 40 µm. The target is constantly rotated
and translated in order to avoid multiple laser hits at the
same spot. X-ray emission from the plasma is observed
at 45◦ to the plume direction using a NaI (Tl) detec-
tor and a multi-channel analyzer. The detector is gated
by the laser pulse and the signal is collected only in a
time window of 30 µs, to ensure background-free signal
acquisition.

We use two types of copper NP coated targets, one
with spherical (inset of Fig. 1) and the other with ellip-

l
soidal particles(referred to as SNP and ENP hereafter).
Their emission is compared with highly polished cop-
per (average local roughness ∼ 5 nm) targets. Copper
nanoparticles are deposited by high pressure dc sput-
tering [14] on such polished copper discs (held at 0◦C
for spherical particles and at −50◦C for ellipsoids). The
resulting nanocrystalline Cu ﬁlms are optically ﬂat and
1 µm in thickness. The coherently diﬀracting crystal-
lographic domain size (dXRD) is obtained from x-ray
diﬀraction line broadening, using the Scherrer technique.
For a ﬁlm deposited in 180 mTorr Ar environment at a
sputtering power of 200W, we obtain dXRD = 15nm. The
aspect ratio is obtained from a comparison of dXRD cal-
culated from (111) and (200) diﬀraction lines. For basic
optical characterization, the linear absorption spectra are
measured (Fig. 1). The ENP (aspect ratio of about 1.5)
have comparatively less absorption in the linear regime,
in contrast to their behavior at higher intensities, as dis-
cussed later. At 800 nm, which is quite far from the
inter-band transition regime, a Drude model ﬁt yields
the eﬀective permittivity (ǫ′ + iǫ′′) of the SNP-void com-
posite to be −0.7 + i6.5 and that of the ENP-void one to
be −3.8 + i10.5. Using the generalized Bruggeman eﬀec-
tive medium approximation [15], the permittivities of the
SNP and ENP are obtained as −27 + i33 and −27 + i44.4
respectively, as opposed to their bulk value −27 + i2.5.
Extensive studies have been carried out on the variation
of the dielectric constant with particle size [16, 17]. The
real part of the dielectric constant is shown to be unaf-
fected in most of the systems, unless the particle size is
extremely small. The imaginary part increases due to
the limited electron mean-free path in the NP [18]. The
imaginary parts obtained by us above are, however, much
larger than the theoretically predicted values [18] and it
is very likely that this mismatch is due to the factors ex-
cluded in the above modeling viz. particle size distribu-
tion, dipole interactions between particles etc.. However,
this discrepancy does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the interpre-
tations of our results, as will be evident later.

To elucidate the role of nanoparticles in hot electron
generation in two distinct regimes of RA, we present
hard x-ray bremsstrahlung data at two angles of inci-
dence 10◦ and 45◦. Collisional absorption, with some
contribution from RA, is expected to be the main con-
tributor in the former case, while RA is expected to play
a major role in the latter. Fig. 2 presents a comparison of
bremsstrahlung emission for 10◦ incidence, measured at a
solid angle of 720 µSr, from the polished and SNP-coated
copper targets irradiated at 2.0×1015 Wcm−2. The total
energy emitted per laser pulse in the above range from
the polished target is 2.2×10−12 J, whereas it is 1×10−11
J from the nanoparticle coated target, assuming isotropic
emission. Two temperature components, 6 keV and 14
keV are clearly evident in the spectrum from the NP-
coated target, while the higher component is insigniﬁcant
in the emission from the polished target.

FIG. 2: Bremsstrahlung emission from smooth and SNP
coated targets at 10◦. The inset shows the variation of in-
tegrated emission with input laser intensity.

The hot electron temperature given by RA is ex-
pected to follow the scaling law [10] Thot = 6 ×
10−5(Iλ2(W cm−2µm2)) 0.33, where I is the intensity and
λ is the laser wavelength. These parameter values, at
2 × 1015 Wcm−2 yield a Thot of 5.8 keV, close to the ob-
served hot electron temperature for polished targets. The
NP coated targets, however, yield a signiﬁcant higher
temperature component, which arises from the excess
absorption caused by mechanisms involving surface plas-
mons and local ﬁeld enhancements [19] as we show below.
Modiﬁcation of electric ﬁeld both inside and outside
of surface protrusions has been well studied in connec-
tion with second harmonic generation [20] and surface en-
hanced raman scattering [21] in the low intensity regime.
Recently, this argument has been extended to study pho-
toinduced luminescence from metals [22].
In a cluster
plasma, the electric ﬁeld resonance is known to be a ma-
jor source of hot electrons [23]. However, this idea has
not been utilized so far to understand the excess absorp-
tion of intense laser light on modulated surfaces.

For simplicity, the NP target is modeled as a collec-
tion of hemispheroids of permittivity ǫ, embedded on a
ﬂat substrate kept in vacuum, as shown in the inset of
Fig.3. Consider a p-polarized wavefront of amplitude E,
incident at an angle θ to the major axis of the spheroid.
The model becomes much simpler with the assumption
that the ﬁeld along the major axis alone contributes to
the enhancement. Thus, the resultant electric ﬁeld at
any point outside the hemispheroid could be written as

is absent for metals, as there can-

as LR = 1 − ξQ′(ξ)/Q(ξ), ξ = [1 − (b/a)2]−1/2
and Q(ξ) = (ξ/2)ln[(ξ + 1)/(ξ − 1)] − 1. For an elon-
gated spheroid, the enhancement is prominent only to-
wards the tip (low α values). The eﬀective intensity at
the tip (α = 0◦) can be written as

The local ﬁeld correction factors have a resonant be-
haviour with a/b, the aspect ratio of the spheroid, as
shown in ﬁg.3. The dielectric constant ǫ is assumed to
be a function of the particle diameter, viz.
ǫnano =
ǫ′
bulk + iǫ′′
bulk(1 + l/b), where l is the mean free path of the
electrons [16]. As is evident, silver NPs with aspect ratios

close to the resonance values will yield greater enhance-
ments than similar ones of gold and copper. The res-
onance becomes sharper as b is reduced, although, Lout
⊥
does not depend critically on ǫ and b for small a/b values.
Substituting the value of Lout
⊥ for the spherical particle,
we obtain Ir/Iin ∼ 1.4, at θ = 10◦. Thus, the NP-coated
target is equivalent to a polished target with a rescaled
intensity.

Fig.2 (inset) provides a comparison of the original data
of yields of SNP and polished targets with the data
obtained by rescaling the points for the NP target by
Ir = 1.4I, and they are in reasonably good agreement.
It is noted that the ratio of yields from the nanoparticle
coated target to that from smooth targets decreases from
a value of 4.7 at an intensity of 2 × 1015 W cm−2 to 1.3
at 4.5 × 1015 Wcm−2, suggesting probable damage of the
nanoparticle structure as the intensity is increased.

Fig. 4 presents a comparison of bremsstrahlung emis-
sion, measured at a solid angle of 22 mSr, from the pol-
ished, spherical and ellipsoidal NP-coated copper targets
irradiated at 6.0 × 1014 Wcm−2. As pointed out earlier,
RA is expected to produce heavy ﬂuxes of hot electrons
at this angle. The total energy emitted per pulse from a
polished target is 4.2 × 10−14 J, while it is 5.7 × 10−13 J
using the ENP target, assuming isotropic emission. This
amounts to a 13-fold enhancement in hot electron pro-
duction at an intensity which is less than half of that
used for 10◦ incidence. The spherical nanoparticles yield
1.4 × 10−13 J, giving ∼ 3-fold enhancement as at the low-
est intensity at 10◦. Two temperature components, 3 keV
and 11 keV, are observed in the spectrum from both NP-
coated targets, whereas the higher component is hardly
present in the emission from polished target. That the el-
lipsoidal nanoparticles give more than 4 times yield than
the spherical particles is easily understood from Fig. 3,
to be due to the enhancement of both ‘lightning rod’ ef-
fect and plasmon resonance. An intensity rescaling as
above, gives Ir/Iin ∼ 9, almost in agreement with the
x-ray yield enhancement as predicted by RA (∼ I 4/3).
The fact that the higher component Thot obtained using
NP-coated target corresponds to that obtained using a
polished target at 9 × 1015 W cm−2 (close to the rescaled
intensity for the ellipsoidal particle), as reported in our
earlier work [24], further supports this intensity rescaling.
From another perspective, enhancement in absorption
is expected to be due to the enhanced absorption depth
caused by radiation conﬁnement (‘volume’ heating) in
the nano-structures. The absorption coeﬃcient for a col-
lection of small spheres with average density f compared
with a solid is given by α = (18πf /λ)ǫ(ω)′′/[(ǫ′(ω) +
2)2 + ǫ′′(ω)2] [25]. Even at the non-resonant wavelength
under use, the absorption length (α−1) in an NP tar-
get can be as much as 0.6 µm, compared to about 10
nm in a polished target. Moreover, the ﬁeld enhance-
ments are responsible for increased nonlinearities. Opti-
cal nonlinearity of the nth order is enhanced by a factor

((ǫ′ − 1)4/ǫ′′2)n−1 [12, 26]. Thus, multiphoton ionization
in NP target will be tremendously enhanced as compared
to the polished targets, which, in turn results in denser
plasma formation and excess energy absorption. A 3-
photon process is required for the optical ionization of
an NP, as the single ionization energy is 4.5 eV, and is
calculated to be enhanced by 9 × 104, given the factors
assumed immediately above. Due to the enhanced local
ﬁelds and ﬁnite size of the surface protrusions, the os-
cillation energy of electrons reach a high value even at
moderate intensities [27]. A recent study [26] measured
energies as high as 30 eV electrons from a grating mod-
ulated surface at low intensities of 109 W cm−2 at 800
nm, as opposed to a few eV energies from smooth targets.
This is understood to be the result of the ponderomotive
energy [10] given to the electrons by the light ﬁeld quan-
tiﬁed by the relation U = e2Iλ2/16mc2π2. Thus, even a
weak pedestal or the very early rising edge of an intense
laser pulse can generate plenty of energetic electrons in
the NP target and create a signiﬁcant amount of a pre-
plasma, enabling an eﬃcient energy coupling (RA). The
critical layer would also be naturally ‘rippled’ due to the
surface topography, favoring signiﬁcant RA irrespective
of the angle of incidence, as evidenced by the data at 10◦
and our recent observation [24].

In a summary, we report a 13-fold enhancement of
bremsstrahlung emission in the 10-200 keV range from
a copper nanoparticle coated target in comparison to an
optically polished copper target. A simple model of the
surface shows that enhancements in local electromag-
netic ﬁelds result in excess absorption and hotter elec-

4

trons, which in turn enhances the x-ray emission. Such
enhanced emission is very attractive for practically vi-
able hard x-ray sources. Further, this model yields guid-
ance for designing better sources of ultrashort hard x-ray
pulses and further studies are in progress towards this
goal. The intensity levels we have used in this study are
very modest and are easily available from modern fem-
tosecond lasers operating at multi-kHz repetition rates
[28], making applications of nanoparticle coated targets
very promising.

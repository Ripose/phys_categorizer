Abstract

Electromagnetic wave propagation through cold collision free plasma is studied using
the nonlinear perturbation method. It is found that the equations can be reduced to
the modiﬁed Kortweg-de Vries equation.

Introduction

An exciting and extremely active area of research investigation during the past years has
been the study of solitons and the related issue of the construction of solutions to a wide
class of nonlinear equations. The concept of solitons has now become umbiquitous in
modern nonlinear science and indeed can be found in various branches of physics.
In
nonlinear wave propagation through continuous media, steepening of waves arises due
to nonlinearities which is balanced by dissipative or dispersive eﬀects. Exciting and im-
portant discoveries were made in the nonlinear dynamics of dissipative and conservative
systems. There are diﬀerent methods to study nonlinear systems. The reductive pertur-
bation method for the propagation of a slow modulation of a quasimonochromatic wave
was ﬁrst established by Taniuti and Washimi for the whistler wave in a cold plasma. This
method was generalised to a wide class of nonlinear wave systems by Taniuty and Yajima.
Kakutani and Ono [1], Kawahara and Taniuti [2] and Taniuti and Wei [3] have investigated
the propagation of hydromagnetic waves through a cold collision free plasma using this
reductive perturbation method.

In the study of the asymptotic behaviour of nonlinear dispersive waves, Gardner and

Morikava [4] were the ﬁrst to introduce the scale transformation

ξ = εα(x − vt),

τ = εβt.

This scale transformation is called the Gardner-Morikawa [4] transformation. They com-
bined this transformation with a perturbation expansion of the dependent variables so
as to describe the nonliear asymptotic behaviour and in the process they arrived at the

Kortweg de-Vries [KdV] equation [5] which is a single tractable equation describing the
asymptotic behaviour of a wave. This method has established a systematic way for the
reduction of a fairly general nonlinear systems to a single tractable nonlinear equation de-
scribing the far ﬁeld behaviour. The reductive perturbation method was ﬁrst established
for the long wave approximation and then for the wave modulation problems.

In the present work we study the propagation of electromagnetic waves through a cold
collision free plasma by using a nonlinear reductive perturbation method.
It is found
that to the lowest order of perturbation the system of equations can be reduced to the
modiﬁed Kortweg-de Vries equation (mKdV) [6]. In the case of steady state propagation
this equation can be integrated to give a solution in terms of hyperbolic functions which
exhibit solitary wave nature.

2 Formulation of the problem

When electromagnetic waves pass through a medium , the system gets perturbed. Since
electrons are much lighter than ions, electrons respond much more rapidly to the ﬁelds
and ion motion can be neglected.
In the equation of momentum for cold plasma, no
pressure term is present. Basic equations relevant to the present problem are the equations
of motion of electron and the Maxwell’s equations. Here we are interested only in the
electronic motion. To obtain a single equation which incorporates weak nonlinear and
weak dispersive eﬀects, we employ the expansions of the dependent variables similar to
that introduced by Nakata [7].

The equation of motion of an electron in an electromagnetic ﬁeld is

For convenience we take the displacement vector ﬁeld ~S, which describes the direction and
distance that the plasma has moved from the equilibrium. That is,

Taking the leading order terms we get,

and writing

we obtain:

kE = ωB.

Substituting Eq.(3) in Eq.(2) we can write:

where W =
. Physically each electron is acted upon by an electric ﬁeld that is parallel
to the magnetic ﬁeld so that there is no perpendicular component of motion that could
be aﬀected by the Lorentz force, that is ~v × ~B = 0 [8]. Then Eq.(1) can be written as

which can be put as:

~B = µ0 ~H,

∇ × ~E = −

∇ × ~H = ~J + ε0

Taking the time derivative of Eq.(7) we get,

∇ × ∇ × ~E = 1/c2 ∂2 ~E

Equations (5) and (9) are systems of complicated nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations
for ~E and ~S describing electromagnetic wave propagation through plasma. Let us seek
a solution of these equations in the form of a Fourier expansion in harmonics of the
fundamental E = ei(kx−ωt) as,

Let us now consider one dimensional plane wave propagating along the x direction in
the Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z). All the physical quantities are assumed to be
functions of one space coordinate x and time t. We now introduce the streching variables

Before proceeding to the nonlinear problem, it may be instructive to examine the
dispersive relation in the linearized limit. Assuming a sinusoidal wave exp i(kx − ωt),
where k, ω are respectively the wave number and the frequency of the wave. Expanding
the above coupled equations,

j → 0 for j = 0 for all “n” except for
(j, | n |) = (1, 1), where the limit is assumed to be a ﬁnite constant. For n = 1, ∆(1) = 0
for j = 1. Under this condition the system has a nontrivial solution. But for n = 2, 3, 4, . . .,
∆n 6= 0, we have the trivial solution. That is for j = 1 and n > 1, we get En

1 = Sn

1 = 0.

For n = 0, ∆(0) = 0, we can choose E0

1 = S0

1 = 0. This completes the solution at order

(1, n).

For the next order, we can proceed in the same manner. The system will have a solution

only if the determinant of the augmented matrix is zero .

This equation is the modiﬁed Kortweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation. In the case of steady

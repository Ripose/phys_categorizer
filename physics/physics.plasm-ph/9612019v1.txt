The saturation of ion cyclotron Alfv´en turbulence excited by beam particles is investigated
using resonance broadening theory. The stochastic scattering which decorrelates particles, includes
both random acceleration by electric ﬁelds and a turbulent magnetic mirroring eﬀect. Turbulent
mirroring is shown to yield non-Gaussian corrections to the orbits even if the random electric and
magnetic ﬁelds are Gaussian. The predicted steady-state turbulence level exhibits a peaked anglular
distribution, with a maximum near Θ ≃ 60◦.

It is well known that the interaction of the solar wind plasma with planetary magnetospheres and cometary plasmas
results in a high level of wave activity [1–3]. Gyrating solar wind ions are a possible agent for exciting high-frequency
instabilities. It has been suggested [4,5] that these magnetic ﬂuctuations result from ion cyclotron instability, which
occurs when the solar wind plasma interacts with a beam of cometary ions. A signiﬁcant eﬀort has been made to
understand the turbulence generated by comet-solar wind interactions using quasilinear theory [4-6] as well as by
simulation studies [7–12]. Ions are implanted in the solar wind plasma by melting and photoionization, thus forming
In the far-
an unstable ‘bump-on-tail’ like (i.e. shifted Maxwellian) distribution in the solar wind frame [13,14].
upstream vicinity of a comet, ions form a ring distribution. When the phase velocity of a circularly polarized wave
coincides with the parallel velocity of particles, i.e. there is an ion cyclotron resonance ω − kkvk = Ωi between the
particles and the wave, they resonantly pump the wave. Using quasilinear theory, saturation is predicted to occur via
plateau formation in the distribution function. This mechanism is rather slow, with a saturation rate of the inverse
plateau formation time (i.e. a velocity diﬀusion time). Saturation via resonance broadening is much faster, with a
time scale comparable to the instability growth rate (i.e. since the resonance width is proportional to the ﬂuctuation
amplitude). Thus, even if macroscopic modiﬁcation of the distribution function (´a la plateau formation) occurs, it
should be calculated in the presence of a ﬁnite width, ﬂuctuation-broadened resonance. Moreover, the quasilinear
theory predicts high level of turbulence at Θ ≃ 0◦, only (Θ is the angle between the wave propagation direction and
the ambient magnetic ﬁeld), whereas observational data (for example, from the comet P/Grigg-Skjellerup [15,16])
indicates an the average value of Θ between 50◦ − 60◦ at large distances from the comet (R > 400, 000 km. for P/GS)
and 75◦ − 90◦ closer to the comet. The saturation level prediction given here, which is based on resonance broadening
theory, yields a peaked Θ-proﬁle with the maximum value at Θm ≃ 65◦ for P/GS parameters. Note that near-normal
angles of propagation can also result from excitation of left hand polarized waves by normal Doppler resonance [17]
m ≃ 60◦ and observations from the Ulysses spacecraft give
in the case when vk cos Θ < vA. For Jupiter we predict Θth
Θexp

m ≃ 55◦ − 60◦ [24].
We develop a nonlinear kinetic model, so it is natural to anzatz that the high-frequency turbulent background is
composed of a large number of kinetic shear Alfv´en waves which are excited in plasma by the ion cyclotron instability.
The ion-cyclotron resonance becomes ω −kkvk −Ωi ∼ kk(vA −vbeam)−Ωi. We keep (k⊥ρi)2 terms, however, since they
can be signiﬁcant at large angles kk/k⊥ ≪ 1. An energetic particle immersed in a such turbulent background is subject

to stochastic scattering which includes both random acceleration by electric ﬁelds (
B⊥). Random electric ﬁelds result in the diﬀusion of guiding centers in the
analogue of magnetic mirroring (v⊥ ×

shifts caused by this scattering decorrelate the particles from resonance. To calculate this stochastic decorrelation, we
employ a modiﬁed stochastic orbit theory [18,19] which was developed for both low-frequency (ω ≪ Ωi) instabilities
[20,21] and high-frequency (ω ≃ Ωi) instabilities [22]. As is shown below, the theory yields results which are in very
good agreement with the experimental data, in regards amplitude and k⊥/kk dependence.

Starting from the Vlasov equation, we separate the distribution function into the averaged (over fast time and
space scales) part hf (x, v, t)i, the test wave response fk(x, v, t), and background responce. We introduce electric and

follows from the fact that kinetic shear Alfv`en waves are incompressible. Formally applying the procedure developed
in [22], we now arrive at the lowest order solution of the Vlasov equation

To explore the ﬁnite amplitude regime, note that the resonance function R is expressed via the perturbation of the
orbit function of a test particle, Eq. (2). Expanding hexp(ik · δx)i in a Taylor series, with the conditions Ωiτ ≫ 1 and

are non-zero. The error function is an increasing function of its argument. Thus, corrections appear on the tail of the
Gaussian distribution, i.e. at suﬃciently large times such that τ ∼ τkinetic. This eﬀect implies temporal intermittancy
for strongly mirrored particles. On intermediate time-scales Ω−1

even when δB/B ∼ 1. To capture the simple physical eﬀect of resonance broadening we can drop the non-Gaussian

The sums in these equations run over the full range of the background turbulence spectrum −∞ < k′ < ∞. Here
‘unprimed’ wave vectors refer to the test wave. Eqs. (8,9) describe the general case of resonance broadening due to the
eﬀects of scattering of a test particle by random ﬁelds. They can be simpliﬁed by assuming a narrow-band spectrum
[22]. As it will be shown later from estimating the spectrum at saturation, the narrow spectrum approximation is
2 can be replaced by (δB/B)2. As we consider the ion cyclotron resonance
valid for this case. Then
with ions we may set n = 1. n 6= 1 terms give only a small correction.

The broadening ∆ω(v) should be averaged over the velocity distribution function [22]. Saturation occurs when
the resonance broadening becomes comparable to the linear growth rate γ0, i.e. when the total nonlinear growth
rate vanishes, γN L = γ0 − ∆ω = 0. This saturation mechanism does not rely upon quasilinear plateau for-
mation and thus is applicable to instances where the unstable distribution is maintained externally, such as
in the case of comet-solar wind interaction. For the ion cyclotron instability, we deﬁne the average broaden-

γ0 − ∆ω⊥ = 0), we obtain

Fig. 1 shows the anisotropy of magnetic ﬂuctuation level in propagation angle Θ (tan Θ = k⊥/kk). One can see that
at small angles (Θ ≃ 0◦) with respect to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld, very small background turbulence levels saturate
the ion cyclotron instability. The same is true of the near-perpendicular case, Θ ∼ 90◦. There the turbulence is
strongly self-suppressed. This is not the case for Θ ≃ 60◦. Here, the amplitude of the background Alfv´en waves must
be large for resonance broadening to self-consistently suppress the ion cyclotron instability. The main energy content
of the observable MHD activity, therefore, is associated with Alfv´en waves propagating at large angles relative to the
averaged magnetic ﬁeld. The peak is strongly localized at angles near Θm ≃ 60◦. The value Θm of the maximum
turbulent ﬂuctuation is remarkably insensitive to plasma parameters such as bulk plasma and ion beam temperatures,
density and drift velocity of the beam, etc. For all reasonable parameters, Θm remains approximately 60 degrees.
The magnitude of the maximum ﬂuctuation level, on the contrary, depends sensitively on the beam and plasma
parameters. Fig. 2 is a plot of experimental data of MHD activity near Jupiter, obtained by the spacecraft Ulysses
[24]. Here the level of ﬂuctuations (in arbitrary units), measured for diﬀerent angles, is shown. It is apparent that
the dominant waves are those propagating at angles in the interval 50◦ < Θ < 70◦. There is remarkable agreement
of the angular distribution obtained from experiments [15,16,24] with our very simple theory. Quasilinear theory
predicts a diﬀerent result [5,17], which is (approximately) (mini/mpnp)2/3(vD/vA)1/3. The Θ-dependence predicted
by quasilinear theory is not in agreement with experimental data, although it gives a reasonable prediction of the
magnitude, i.e. δB/B ∼ 1.

We emphasize the fact that the peaked angular distribution is the result of both perpendicular and parallel diﬀusion.
The perpendicular diﬀusion (the diﬀusion of guiding centers) is a result of the magnetic ﬁeld line ﬂutter and is
responsible for the resonance broadening at larger angles, Θ ∼ 90◦. The parallel diﬀusion (the randomized step-size
of a particle helical trajectory) is due to the random mirroring force. It is responsible for the instability suppression
at small angles of wave propagation, i.e.
It is important to note that the parallel diﬀusion in
∼ τ 3 type decorrelation process in real space. However, for intermediate time-scales
velocity space results in a
Ω−1
i ≪ τ ≪ τkinetic, it can be modelled by a standard diﬀusion process. The magnetic mirroring gives rise to

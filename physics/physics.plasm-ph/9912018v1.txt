Abstract

Using the dielectric theory for a weakly coupled plasma we investigate the stopping power of

the ion in a temperature anisotropic magnetized electron plasma. The analysis is based on the

assumption that the energy variation of the ion is much less than its kinetic energy. The obtained

general expression for stopping power is analyzed for weak and strong magnetic ﬁelds (i.e., for the

electron cyclotron frequency less than and greater than the plasma frequency), and for low and

high ion velocities. It is found that the friction coeﬃcient contains, in addition to the usual velocity

independent friction coeﬃcient, an anomulous term which diverges logarithmically as the projectile

velocity approaches zero. The physical origin of this anomulous term is the coupling between the

cyclotron motion of the electrons and the long-wave length, low-frequency ﬂuctuations produced

by the projectile ion.

INTRODUCTION

Energy loss of the ions in a plasma has been a topic of great interest due to its considerable

importance for the study of basic interactions of the charged particles in real media. Recent

applications are electron cooling of heavy ion beams [1, 2, 3] and energy transfer for inertial

conﬁnement fusion (ICF) (see [4] for an overview). Electron cooling is realized by mixing

the ion beam periodically with a cold electron beam of the same average velocity. The

interaction length is normally about a few meters and the electron beam is guided by a

magnetic ﬁeld parallel to its direction of motion. The cooling of the ion beam may then

be viewed as an energy loss in the common rest frame of both beams. Similar questions

arise in heavy-ion-induced ICF. There a frozen hydrogen pellet is heated and compressed by

stopping of ion beams in the surrounding converter. In this case the electrons of the solid

state converter are acting like a plasma and absorb the incoming energy.

In the electron cooling process the velocity distribution of the electron beam is highly

anisotropic because of the acceleration from the cathode to the cooling section. It can be

described by a Maxwell distribution with two diﬀerent temperatures, a longitudinal T
k

and

a transversal T

[1, 2, 3]. Furthermore, an external, longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is needed

⊥

to guide the electrons from the cathode to and through the electron cooler and to stabilize

the anisotropic velocity distribution by suppressing the transverse-longitudinal relaxation.

In the present paper we are interested in the inﬂuences of the magnetic ﬁeld and the

temperature anisotropy on the ion beam stopping power.

Since the early 1960’s several theoretical calculations of the stopping power in a mag-

netized plasma have been presented [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Stopping of a fast

test particle moving with velocity V much higher than the electron thermal velocity vth

was studied in Refs.

[5, 6, 8]. Energy loss of a charged particle moving with arbitrary

velocity was studied in Ref. [7]. The expression obtained there for the Coulomb logarithm,

Λ = ln(λD/ρ

) (where λD is the Debye length and ρ

is the impact parameter for scat-

⊥

⊥

tering for an angle ϑ = π/2), corresponds to the classical description of collisions. In the

quantum-mechanical case, the Coulomb logarithm is Λ = ln(λD/λB), where λB is the de

Broglie wavelength of plasma electrons [15].

In Ref.

[10], the expressions were derived describing the stopping power of a charged

particle in Maxwellian plasma placed in a classically strong (but not quantizing) magnetic

2

ac ≪

λD, where ac is the electron Larmor radius), under the conditions when

ﬁeld (λB ≪
scattering must be described quantum mechanically. Calculations were carried out for slow
test particles whose velocities satisfy the conditions (m/mi)1/3vth < V

vth, where mi is

≪

the mass of the plasma ions and m is the electron mass.

In the recent paper [11] the stopping power in the magnetized plasma has been inves-

tigated for high-velocity light particles taking into account the Larmor rotation of a test

projectile in a magnetic ﬁeld. It has been shown that the stopping power can exhibit an

oscillatory dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld and that it is much greater than in the case

without magnetic ﬁeld.

More attention has been paid on the stopping power in a strongly magnetized plasma

for ions which move along the magnetic ﬁeld [11, 12, 13]. Both uncorrelated [11, 13] and

correlated [12] situations have been discussed.

These investigations have concentrated on the stopping power in temperature isotropic

plasma. Extensions to nonlinear eﬀects of ion stopping and temperature anisotropy have

been done recently by particle-in-cell (PIC) computer simulation [14], where the case T

k ≪
has been investigated which is interesting for electron cooling process. Here, in the

T

framework of dielectric theory, we will focus on the stopping power at arbitrary temperature

⊥

anisotropy T

.

The paper is organized as follows. We start in Sec. II, with solving the linearized Vlasov-

Poisson equations by means of Fourier transformation. This provides the general form of the

linearized potential generated in a temperature anisotropic magnetized Maxwellian plasma

by a projectile ion from which the stopping power is deduced.

In the next Sec. III, is dedicated to apply our results to nonmagnetized plasma. Calcula-

tions are carried out for small projectile velocities at arbitrary temperature anisotropy and

arbitrary direction of ion motion with respect to the anisotropy axis.

Then we turn to the eﬀect of a weak magnetic ﬁeld on the stopping power in Sec. IV,

while we concentrate on the inﬂuence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld in Sec. V. In contrast with

the papers [11, 13] we consider an ion motion in arbitrary direction.

As the last issue we investigate in Sec. VI the stopping power for small projectile veloc-

ities at arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld and temperature anisotropy. The friction coeﬃcient there

contains an anomalous term which increases logarithmically when the projectile velocity

approaches to zero.

The achieved results are ﬁnally summarized and discussed in Sec. VII.

electrons we deﬁne an average temperature T = 1

. Within the dielectric theory the

electron plasma is described as a continuous, polarizable ﬂuid (medium), which is represented

by the phase-space density of the electrons f (r, v, t). Here, only a mean-ﬁeld interaction

between the electrons is considered and hard collisions are neglected and the evolution of

the distribution function f (r, v, t) is determined by the Vlasov-Poisson equation is valid for

weakly coupled plasmas where the number of electrons in the Debye sphere ND = 4πn0λ
D ≫
1 is very large. Here n0 is the electron density, λD = (kBT /4πn0e2)1/2 is an averaged Debye

length.

In the following, we consider a nonrelativistic projectile ion with charge Ze and with a

velocity V that moves in a magnetized temperature anisotropic plasma at an angle ϑ with

respect to the magnetic ﬁeld B0. The axis deﬁned by B0 also coincides with the degree

of freedom with temperature T
k

. We assume that the energy variation of the ion is much

smaller than its kinetic energy. The strength of the coupling betweeen an ion moving with

velocity V and the electron plasma is given by the coupling parameter

The stopping power S of an ion is deﬁned as the energy loss of the ion in a unit length due

to interactions with the plasma electrons. From Eq. (5) it is straightforward to calculate

eﬀective minimum impact parameter) in order to avoid the logarithmic divergence at large

k. This divergence corresponds to the incapability of the linearized Vlasov theory to treat

close encounters between the projectile ion and the plasma electrons properly. For rmin

we thus use the eﬀective minimum impact parameter of classical binary Coulomb collisions

A two temperature description of an electron plasma is valid only when the ion beam-

plasma interaction time is less than the relaxation time between the two temperatures, T
k

and

T

. For an estimate we will brieﬂy consider the ﬁeld-free case, because the external magnetic

ﬁeld suppresses the relaxation between the transversal and longitudinal temperatures during

the time of ﬂight of the ion beam through plasma.

The problem of a temperature relaxation in a temperature anisotropic plasma with and

without of an external magnetic ﬁeld was considered by Ichimaru [17]. Within the dominant-

term approximation the relaxation time ∆τrel for the plasma without magnetic ﬁeld is given

When a projectile ion moves slowly through a plasma, the electrons have much time to

experience the ion attractive potential. They are accelerated towards the ion, but when

they reach its trajectory the ion has already moved forward a little bit. Hence, we expect

an increased density of electrons at some place in the trail of the ion. This negative charge

density pulls back the positive ion and gives rise to the stopping. This drag force is of

particular interest for the electron cooling process. In the limit of small velocities S

This looks like the friction law of a viscous ﬂuid, and accordingly R is called the friction

coeﬃcient. However, in the case of an ideal plasma it should be noted that this law does

not depend on the plasma viscosity and is not a consequence of electron-electron collisions

which are neglected in the Vlasov equation.

coeﬃcient decreases. For ϑ

electrons thermal ﬂuctuation. Therefore, the impact parameter for electron-ion collisions

increases which rises the friction coeﬃcient.

For arbitrary projectile velocities we evaluated Eq. (16) numerically.

In the temperature isotropic plasma (τ = 1) Eq. (32) coincides with the results by May and

Cramer [7] after integration over ϕ. Note that the additional term S1 does not depend on

the cutoﬀ parameter kmax.

In the next subsections we evaluate Eq. (32) for small and large projectile velocities.

we have P1(1) = P2(1) = 1.

In Fig. 4 the normalized friction coeﬃcient P (ϑ, τ ) for the additional stopping power S1

is plotted as a function of τ for ϑ = 0 (solid line), ϑ = π/6 (dotted line), ϑ = π/3 (dashed

line), ϑ = π/2 (dot-dashed line). The general behaviour of P (ϑ, τ ) is similar to the friction

coeﬃcient of the plasma without magnetic ﬁeld (see Fig. 1). Here, the correction P (ϑ, τ )

can be also negative at small τ and ϑ, which then corresponds to a slight decrease of the

stopping power, Eq. (31).

This result is in accord with the results of Honda et al. [6] and May and Cramer [7], who,
4) in their work as well. Although the function S1 in Eq. (40)
however, kept the terms O(V −
is proportional to the plasma density, the full correction term η2S1 does not depend on the

plasma density.

In Figs. (5) and (6) we show the velocity dependence of the function S1 for τ = 10−
and τ = 102 respectively. The diﬀerent curves are ϑ = 0 (solid line), ϑ = π/6 (dotted line),

ϑ = π/3 (dashed line), ϑ = π/2 (dot-dashed line). For small and medium projectile velocities

the weak magnetic ﬁeld decreases the total stopping power for small τ and increases it in the

high τ limit. For high projectile velocities the magnetic ﬁeld always reduces the stopping

power independent of the temperature anisotropy, see Eq. (40).

V. STOPPING IN PLASMAS WITH STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD

We now turn to the case when a projectile ion moves in a temperature anisotropic plasma

with a strong magnetic ﬁeld, which is on one hand, suﬃciently weak to allow a classical

description (¯hωc < kBT
that the cyclotron frequency of the plasma electrons exceeds the plasma frequency ωc ≫

in the low and high velocity limits (Eqs. (47) and (50)) an enhancement for ions moving

transversal to the magnetic ﬁeld compared to the case of the longitudinal motion (ϑ = 0).

This eﬀect is in agreement with PIC simulation results [14]. In contrast to the ﬁeld-free

case, at strong magnetic ﬁeld and for ϑ = 0, V

(44) and (50)) we have

p/2V 2 independent of kmax. The cutoﬀ kmax necessary at low ion velocities is,
however, less well deﬁned here than for the ﬁeld-free case, where the cutoﬀ (9) was deduced

from the binary collision picture. Now, the electrons are forced to move parallel to B0. Since

we assumed the motion of the ion in this direction as well the ion and an electron just pass

each other along a straight line. For symmetry reasons the total momentum transfer and

the stopping power is zero. Purely binary interactions contribute nothing and the stopping

of the ion is only due to the collective response of the plasma, that is, due to modes with

15

. This suggests taking kmax of the order of 1/λD

, but further

VI. STOPPING AT ARBITRARY MAGNETIC FIELD AND IN LOW-VELOCITY

LIMIT. ANOMALOUS FRICTION COEFFICIENT

We now proceed with a projectile ion at low velocities and at arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld.

This regime is of particular importance for the electron cooling process [1, 2, 3].

In the

presence of a magnetic ﬁeld the friction coeﬃcient here contains a term which diverges like

ln(vth
k

/V ) in addition to the usual (see e.g. Sec. III) constant one.

For this consideration it is convenient to use the Bessel function representation of the

dielectric function which has been given e.g. by Ichimaru [17], see Appendix A Eq. (A7),

and to write the real and imaginary parts of Eq. (A7) separately

For the friction coeﬃcient we have to consider S, given by Eq. (8) in the low-velocity

limit and thus the functions G and F given by Eqs. (52) and (53), when ω = kV. Now we

have to write the Taylor expansion of Eqs. (52) and (53) for small ω = kV. However, the

ﬁrst term of Eq. (53) exhibits a singular behaviour in the limit of ω = kV

0 where the k

The physical origin of such an anomalous friction coeﬃcient may be traced to the spiral

motion of the electrons along the magnetic ﬁeld lines. These electrons naturally tend to

couple strongly with long-wavelength ﬂuctuations (i.e., small k

) along the magnetic ﬁeld.

In addition, when such ﬂuctuations are characterized by slow variation in time (i.e., small

ω = kV), the contact time or the rate of energy exchange between the electrons and the

ﬂuctuations will be further enhanced. In a plasma such low-frequency ﬂuctuations are pro-

vided by the slow projectile ion. The above coupling can therefore be an eﬃcient mechanism

of energy exchange between the electrons and the projectile ion. In the limit of V

0, the

→

frequency ω = kV

0 tends to zero as well. The contact time thus becomes inﬁnite and

the friction coeﬃcient diverges.

→

The anomalous friction coeﬃcient (see Eq. (56)) vanishes, however, when the ion moves

along the magnetic ﬁeld (ϑ = 0). Then the friction coeﬃcient is solely given by the second

term of Eq. (53). The contribution of this term to the stopping power leads to the usual

friction law in plasma and reads for arbitrary angles ϑ

In Figs. (10) and (11) we compare the anomalous term San with the low velocity stopping

without magnetic ﬁeld S0 see Eq. (19), where San/S0 is plotted as a function of ωc/ωp for

ϑ = π/6 (solid line), ϑ = π/3 (dotted line), ϑ = π/2 (dashed line),

and for two values of the anisotropy parameter τ : τ = 0.1 (Fig. (10)), τ = 10 (Fig. (11)).

We conclude that the anomalous term San gives espessially for strong magnetic ﬁelds (ωc >

ωp) and for strongly temperature anisotropic plasma (T

) an important contribution

to the stopping. It should be noted that the observed enhancement of stopping due to San

VII. SUMMARY

The purpose of this work was to analyze the stopping power of an ion in temperature

anisotropic magnetized classical plasma. A general expression obtained for stopping power

was analyzed in four particular cases: in a plasma without magnetic ﬁeld; in a plasma with

weak and very strong magnetic ﬁelds; and in a plasma with arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld and for

low-velocity projectile.

From the results obtained in Secs. III-V, we found that the stopping power essentially

depends on the plasma temperature anisotropy. In ﬁeld-free case and for small ion velocities

the eﬀect of the anisotropy results in an enhancement of the stopping power when the ion

moves in the direction with low temperature.

For small projectile velocities a weak magnetic ﬁeld slightly decreases the ﬁeld-free stop-

ping power for small τ , in the opposite case (large τ ) the ﬁeld-free stopping power slightly

increases.

In the high-velocity limit correction to the ﬁeld-free stopping power for weak

magnetic ﬁelds is always negative and the stopping power is reduced by the magnetic ﬁeld.

In the case of strong magnetic ﬁelds we demonstrated an enhancement of the stopping

power with increasing of ϑ for low and high-velocity regions compared to the case of an ion

which moves along B0.

19

In low-velocity limit but for arbitrary magnetic ﬁeld, we ﬁnd an enhanced stopping power

compared to the ﬁeld-free value mainly due to the strong coupling between the spiral motion

of the electrons and the long-wavelength, low-frequency ﬂuctuations excited by the projectile

ion. This anomalous stopping power increases with the angle ϑ (the angle between ion

velocity V and magnetic ﬁeld B0) and depends strongly on the temperature anisotropy

τ = T

/T
k

⊥

, as seen in Figs. (10) and (11). Although the nature of the anomalous stopping

power is conditioned by the external magnetic ﬁeld the temperature anisotropy of the plasma

can intensify this eﬀect when T

(see Fig. (11)).

T
k

⊥ ≫

This emphasizes the importance of the special role of ﬂuctuations with small k

and small

k

ω (small projectile velocity V ) and as another signiﬁcant contribution to the energy exchange

processes arising from the collective modes of plasma. Potentially, the electron plasma waves

and the ion acoustic waves in a magnetized plasma might provide a signiﬁcant energy-

exchange mechanism between projectile ion and plasma particles. This fact then makes

it necessary to consider the inﬂuence of plasma collective modes to anomalous stopping

process. This problem will be treated in a subsequent work.

Finally, it is pleasure to thank Prof. Christian Toepﬀer for helpful discussions. One of

the authors (H.B.N.) is grateful to Prof. Christian Toepﬀer for hospitality at the Institut

f¨ur Theoretische Physik II, Universit¨at Erlangen-N¨urnberg, where this work was concluded

and would like to thank the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst for ﬁnancial support.

We are indebted to Claudia Schlechte for her help in preparing the manuscript.

case where the velocity distribution of the unperturbated distribution function was given

by Eq. (4). We next introduce the Fourier transformations of f1(r, v, t) with respect to

variables r and t, f1(k, ω, v). Because of the cylindrical symmetry (around the magnetic

ﬁeld direction b = B0/B0 = ˆz) of the problem, we choose

The nature of collisionless reconnection in a three-species plasma composed of a heavy species,
protons, and electrons is examined. Besides the usual two length scales present in two-species
reconnection, there are two additional larger length scales in the system: one associated with a
“heavy whistler” which produces a large scale quadrupolar out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld, and one
associated with the “heavy Alfv´en” wave which can slow the outﬂow speed and thus the reconnection
rate. The consequences for reconnection in the magnetotail with an O+ population present are
discussed.

Introduction: Recent studies of collisionless recon-
nection have shown that the disparate masses of the ions
and electrons lead to a two-scale dissipation region near
the x-line. The decoupling of the ions from the mag-
netic ﬁeld at larger scales than the electrons can lead to
whistler or kinetic Alfv´en physics in the dissipation re-
gion, whose quadratic dispersive characteristics can sub-
stantially increase the reconnection rate[1, 3, 4, 9, 12, 16].
A Sweet-Parker-like[20] analysis of this dissipation region
yields insight into the reconnection rate: Vin
(δ/D)cAt,
where Vin is the inﬂow speed, δ and D are the width and
length of the dissipation region, and cAt is the Alfv´en
speed just upstream from the dissipation region.

Many plasma systems have heavier species, in addition
to protons and electrons, which may play an important
dynamical role: negatively charged dust grains in astro-
physical molecular clouds and the interstellar medium,
and O+ in the Earth’s magnetosphere[18]. These heavier
species will add a hierarchy of new scales to the dissipa-
tion region and will tend to slow down cAt, which pre-
sumably would decrease the reconnection rate. Previous
simulations of three-species reconnection have focussed
on O+ in the magnetosphere, where the number density
of O+ can sometimes exceed that of the protons[8, 11].
Global simulations with ﬂuid O+ found that O+ re-
duced the cross polar cap potential, but these simula-
tions did not spatially resolve the reconnection boundary
layers[21, 22], while other global MHD simulations have
examined the acceleration of passive O+ test particles[2].
Three species full particle simulations found self consis-
tent acceleration of the oxygen by the reconnection elec-
tric ﬁelds but no reconnection rate reduction because the
O+ was not able to couple to the reconnection due to the
small system size[6].

In this paper we present the ﬁrst comprehensive study
of basic three-ﬂuid reconnection showing through theory
and simulation both the eﬀect of the heavy species on the

reconnection rate and the hierarchy of scales present in
the microscale boundary layers. We ﬁnd that the usual
two scales associated with collisionless two-ﬂuid recon-
nection (di = c/ωpi, de = c/ωpe) are instead replaced by
four scales. The inner two scales are associated with a
light whistler and a light Alfv´en wave, which are very
similar to their two-ﬂuid counterparts. At larger scales,
however, a heavy whistler and heavy Alfv´en wave occur.
The heavy whistler can occur on scales much larger than
a di and thus gives rise to a much wider quadrupolar
out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld signature. Associated with
this magnetic ﬁeld are parallel ion Hall currents, the ana-
logue to the light whistler electron currents. The higher
O+ mass substantially slows the reconnection rate be-
cause the outﬂow speed from the x-line is reduced from
the usual proton Alfv´en speed, cAi, to the much slower
heavy Alfv´en speed, cAt. Interestingly, δ/D appeared to
increase in the case with O+, but more careful scaling
studies will be needed to determine if this eﬀect is generic.
Analytical Analysis: We begin with the general
three ﬂuid equations[5] and ﬁrst ignore electron inertia
so that E =
Pe/(nee). We assume quasi-
neutrality, ne = ni + zhnh, where ni is the light ion den-
sity, nh is the heavy species density, and zh is the charge
number of the heavy species. We ignore the displace-
B. We normalize length

Although reconnection is a highly nonlinear process,
much information about its nature can be gleaned from
a linear analysis, for it is bent ﬁeld line waves which
ultimately accelerate the plasma away from the x-line.

The two scale structure of the dissipation region in
a collisionless two-ﬂuid plasma[15] (de and di) has now
been replaced with four scales: the three scales in Fig. 1
plus a very small electron scale δe where the electron
frozen-in constraint is broken. We did not include δe in
this calculation to simplify the analysis and because δe
does not appear to substantially modify the reconnection
rate in well developed Hall mediated reconnection[7, 14].

The reconnection generates very diﬀerent signatures
for the diﬀerent ˆmh. Figs. 2b-d show the out-of-plane By
generated from the reconnection and the proton ﬂow vec-
tors. The x-line is located close to (x, z) = (10,
25.6)
in all three cases. Only a small fraction of the total sim-
ulation is shown. The ˆmh = 1 case shows the usual
quadrupolar structure generated by frozen-in electron
ﬂow[10]. For x > 45, the clean quadrupolar signature
begins to change to a more complicated structure with
both positive and negative By. This occurs because Vix
is maximum at about x = 45, and for greater x the slow-
down of Vix causes a compression of Bz, and the resulting
Jy generates a By signature of the opposite sign. In the
physical system where di
system size, the location of
this slow-down would be very far downstream from the
x-line.

≪

The ˆmh = 16 case (Fig. 2c) shows signatures of both
the light and heavy whistler. For x < 40 a narrow band of
positive By associated with the light whistler is present.
A cut of By, Vix, and Vhx at x = 20 is shown in Fig. 3.
This By spike has a main length scale of about a di,
which is roughly consistent with the light whistler cut-
oﬀ scale of ds = 0.8 for this simulation. Like the usual
two-species whistler, the in plane current generating this
By is due to counterstreaming parallel electron beams
upstream and downstream of the By perturbation. There
is a long tail of By upstream of the spike (z >
23.5) in
Fig. 3a, though, which is not present in the two-species
case. The proton outﬂow shows a peak on the symmetry
axis like the two-ﬂuid case, and its velocity is much larger
than the O+ velocity.

The quadrupolar By becomes dominated by the heavy
whistler for x > 40 in the ˆmh = 16 case. The By signa-
ture broadens out substantially because dh = 5 for this

The reconnection rates of the three simulations ver-
sus time are shown in Fig. 2a. These reconnection rates
were calculated by determining the diﬀerence in magnetic
ﬂux between the x-line and o-line, and then taking the
time derivative. The ˆmh = 1 case clearly shows a sub-
stantially larger reconnection rate. The two cases with
heavy ions show very similar reconnection rates, but the
largest ˆmh shows a large decrease in its reconnection rate
around t = 600, while the ˆmh = 16 case keeps a steady

faster than the ions and exceeding the relevant Alfv´en
speed. The electrons cannot maintain this high velocity
and are forced to decelerate to a speed comparable to the
protons when they reach the light Alfv´en region. Inside
of this Alfv´en region, the protons reach their maximum
velocity. At this point the dynamics diverges from the
two-ﬂuid simulations. The protons, in an analogy to the
electrons in the light whistler region, cannot ﬂow this
speed indeﬁnitely, and are forced to slow down inside the
heavy whistler region. Finally, their speed becomes com-
parable to the O+ outﬂow in the heavy Alfv´en region.
Inside the heavy whistler region at x = 29, however, Vix
drops nearly to zero, below Vhx. This behavior also oc-
curs in the ˆmh = 104 case at about x = 18, as seen in
Fig. 2d. The O+ outﬂows behave like the proton outﬂows
in the two-ﬂuid case, gradually accelerating and ﬁnally
reaching their maximum velocity in the outermost Alfv´en
region. As with the protons in the two-ﬂuid case, the O+
ions ﬂow somewhat faster than the lighter species in the
outermost Alfv´en region[17].

(δ/D)cAt. The initial current sheet width is quite nar-
row for these runs so that cAt remains basically con-
stant during the periods of steady reconnection. For the
cases, we would expect the outﬂow speeds
ˆmh =
1, 16
(mini16 + mhnh)/(ni1mi) = 2.6
to diﬀer by a factor of
between the two cases, where ni1 = 1.64, ni16 = 1.0,
and nh = 0.64. The maximum outﬂow in the two-species
case is about 1.0, while for the case with O+ is .35, giv-
ing a ratio of 2.9, quite close to what is expected.
If
δ/D stayed the same between the two simulations, the
O+ case would be expected to reconnect nearly 3 times
slower than the two-species case.
In Fig. 2a, however,
the two cases asymptote to approximately steady-state
rates that diﬀer by around 1.5, leaving a factor of about
2 unaccounted for. A rough estimation of the scaling
of δ/D between the simulations may be possible by ex-
amining the angle, θ, that the By signature makes with

This gives tan θi = 0.08 and tan θO+ = .15, which sheds

A more careful determination of δ/D as well as a scal-
ing study with very large system sizes will be necessary to
determine if this change in δ/D is robust. Needless to say,
the O+ signiﬁcantly modiﬁed the reconnection process,
substantially slowing the outﬂow speed and the reconnec-
tion rate. These results imply that a substorm occurring
with a high enough O+ density (mhnh
mini) will have
slower outﬂows and a reduced reconnection rate normal-
ized to the upstream proton Alfv´en speed. With all else
being equal, this implies that the expansion phase of sub-
storms will take longer to occur or will reconnect less lobe
ﬁeld in the same amount of time. However, substantial
O+ populations tend to occur during times of increased
geomagnetic activity. The magnetotail equilibrium, and
thus the lobe magnetic ﬁelds and density, may be modi-
ﬁed substantially during these periods, which may oﬀset

simulation, and the current which generates it is carried
by both the ions and electrons. Fig. 4a shows compar-
ison slices for the ˆmh = 1 and 16 cases at x = 55.0.
The main positive By spike is substantially wider in
the ˆmh = 16 case, although it is not 5 times wider as
might be expected from a comparison of dh to di. The
x-velocities reveal another key signature, as shown in
Fig. 4b for ˆmh = 16. The parallel ion ﬂows from the
heavy whistler associated with By lead to a negative Vix
17. Also, the ion ﬂow no longer is maxi-
at about z =
mum at the symmetry line, but instead peaks oﬀ axis at
around z =
20.5. On the symmetry line, Vhx is some-
what larger than Vix. Vix is about 4 times slower in the
ˆmh = 16 case than in the ˆmh = 1 case. The oﬀ axis
peak of Vix and the substantial negative Vix (about 1/3
of maximum ion outﬂow) do not occur unless the heavy
whistler is active.

−

−

In the case with ˆmh = 104, the heavy ions are immov-
able and the heavy whistler is dominant at the global
scales in the simulation as seen in Fig. 2d. The main
peak of By is quite wide, and there is a nonzero By out
to global scales. The parallel ion ﬂows which ﬂow with
the Hall electron currents are much stronger in this case.
The multiscale structure of the dissipation region is
demonstrated for the O+ case in a cut of the outﬂows
away from the x-line, as shown in Fig. 4c, which is a cut
along x through the center of the current sheet. Close
to the x-line the behavior of the ﬂows is very similar to
that seen in two-species reconnection[16, 17]. In the light
whistler region, the electrons accelerate to speeds much

or even overpower the reduction in the reconnection rate.

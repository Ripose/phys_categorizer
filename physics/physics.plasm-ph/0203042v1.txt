Anomalous Capacitive Sheath with Deep Radio Frequency
Electric Field Penetration

(February 2, 2008)

Abstract

A novel nonlinear eﬀect of anomalously deep penetration of an external radio
frequency electric ﬁeld into a plasma is described. A self-consistent kinetic
treatment reveals a transition region between the sheath and the plasma.
Because of the electron velocity modulation in the sheath, bunches in the
energetic electron density are formed in the transition region adjusted to the
sheath. The width of the region is of order VT /ω, where VT is the electron
thermal velocity, and ω is frequency of the electric ﬁeld. The presence of
the electric ﬁeld in the transition region results in a cooling of the energetic
electrons and an additional heating of the cold electrons in comparison with
the case when the transition region is neglected.

The penetration of the electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the plasma boundary was studied
by Landau in the linear approximation [1]. He showed that an external electric ﬁeld with
amplitude E0 is screened by the plasma electrons in the sheath region in a distance of order
the Debye length, and reaches a value E0/ε in the plasma, where ε is plasma dielectric
constant. In many practical applications, the value of the external electric ﬁeld is large: the
potential drop in the sheath region Vsh is typically of order hundreds of Volts and is much
larger than electron temperature Te, which is of order of a few Volts; and the ﬁeld penetration
has to be treated nonlinearly. The asymptotic solution of sheath structure has been studied
by Lieberman in the limit Vsh >> Te [2]. In this treatment, the plasma sheath boundary
is considered to be inﬁnitely thin and the position of the boundary is determined by the
condition that the external electric ﬁeld is screened in the sheath regions when electrons
are absent. Electron interactions with the sheath electric ﬁeld are traditionally treated as
collisions with a moving potential barrier (wall).
It is well known that multiple electron
collisions with an oscillating wall result in electron heating, provided there is suﬃcient
phase-space randomization in the plasma bulk. It is common to describe the sheath heating
by considering the electrons as test particles, and neglecting the plasma electric ﬁelds [3].
Kaganovich and Tsendin proved in Ref. [4] that accounting for the electric ﬁeld in the plasma
reduces the electron sheath heating, and the electron sheath heating vanishes completely in
the limit of uniform plasma density. Therefore, an accurate description of the rf ﬁelds in the
bulk of the plasma is necessary for calculating the sheath heating. The electron velocity is
oscillatory in the sheath, and as a result of this velocity modulation electron density bunches
appear in the region adjusted to the sheath. The electron density perturbations decay due

1

to phase mixing over a length of order VT /ω, where VT is the electron thermal velocity,
and ω is the frequency of the electric ﬁeld. The electron density perturbations polarize the
plasma and produce an electric ﬁeld in the plasma bulk. This electric ﬁeld, in turn, changes
the velocity modulation and correspondingly inﬂuences the electron density perturbations.
Therefore, electron sheath heating has to be studied in a self-consistent nonlocal manner
assuming a ﬁnite temperature plasma.

Notwithstanding the fact, that particle-in-cell simulations results are widely available for
the past decade [5-7] a basic understanding of the electron sheath heating is incomplete,
because no one has studied the electric ﬁeld in the plasma bulk using a nonlocal approach,
similar to the anomalous skin eﬀect for inductive electric ﬁeld [8]. In this regard, analytical
models are of great importance because they shed light on the most complicated features
of collisionless electron interactions with the sheath. In this Letter, an analytical model is
developed to explore the eﬀects associated with the self-consistent non-local nature of the
phenomenon.

One of the approaches to study electron sheath heating is based on a ﬂuid description of
the electron dynamics. For the collisionless case, closure assumptions for the viscosity and
heat ﬂuxes are necessary. In most cases, the closure assumptions are made empirically or
phenomenologically [6, 7]. The closure assumptions have to be justiﬁed by direct comparison
with the results of kinetic calculations as is done, for example, in Ref. [9]. Otherwise,
inaccurate closure assumptions may lead to misleading results as discussed below.

To model the sheath-plasma interaction analytically, the following simplifying assump-
tions have been adopted. The discharge frequency is assumed to be small compared with
the electron plasma frequency. Therefore, most of the external electric ﬁeld is screened in
the sheath region by an ion space charge. The ion response time is typically larger than the
inverse discharge frequency, and the ion density proﬁle is quasi-stationary. There is an ion
ﬂow from plasma bulk towards electrodes. In the sheath region, ions are being accelerated
towards the electrode by the large sheath electric ﬁeld, and, the ion density in the sheath
region is small compared with the bulk ion density. In the present treatment, the ion density
proﬁle is assumed ﬁxed and is modeled in a two-step approximation: the ion density nb is
uniform in the plasma bulk, and the ion density in the sheath nsh < nb is also uniform
(see Fig.1). At the sheath-plasma boundary, there is a stationary potential barrier for the
electrons (eΦsh), so that only the energetic electrons reach the sheath region. The potential
barrier is determined by the quasineutrality condition, i.e., when the energetic electrons
enter the sheath region, their mean density is equal to the ion density [ne(Φsh) = nsh].

The electron density proﬁle is time-dependent in response to the time-varying sheath
electric ﬁeld. The large sheath electric ﬁeld does not penetrate into the plasma bulk. There-
fore, the quasineutrality condition holds in the plasma bulk, i.e., the electron density is equal
to ion density, ne = nb. In the sheath region, the electrons are reﬂected by the large sheath
electric ﬁeld. Therefore, ne = nsh for x > xsh(t), and ne = 0 for x < xsh(t), where xsh(t) is
the position of the plasma-sheath boundary [2]. From Maxwell’s equations it follows that
J = 0, where the total current J is the sum of the displacement current and the electron
J = 0 yields the conservation of the

current. In the one-dimensional case, the condition

where Poisson’s equation has been used to determined the spatial dependence of the sheath
electric ﬁeld. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq.(2) describes the electric ﬁeld at
the electrode, the second term relates to ion space charge screening of the sheath electric
ﬁeld. The position of the plasma-sheath boundary xsh(t) is determined by the zero of the
sheath electric ﬁeld, Esh[xsh(t), t] = 0. From Eq.(2) it follows that

xsh(t) =

[1 + cos(ωt + φ)],

Vsh0
ω

(3)

where Vsh0 = j0/(ensh) is the amplitude of the plasma-sheath boundary velocity. The ion
ﬂux on the electrode is small compared with the electron thermal ﬂux. Because electrons
attach to the electrode, the electrode surface charges negatively, so that in a steady-state
discharge, the electric ﬁeld at the electrode is always negative, preventing an electron ﬂux on
the electrode. However, for a very short time (ωtn + φ
π(1 + 2n)) the sheath electric ﬁeld
vanishes, allowing electrons to ﬂow to the electrode for compensation of the ion ﬂux. Note
that there is a large diﬀerence between the sheath structure in the discharge and the sheath
for obliquely incident waves interacting with a plasma slab without any bounding walls.
Because electrodes are absent, electrons can move outside the plasma, and the electric ﬁeld
in the vacuum region, Esh(x, t) = (4πj0/ω) cos(ωt+φ), may have a diﬀerent sign. Therefore,
electrons may penetrate into the region of large electric ﬁeld during time when Esh(x, t) < 0
[10,11]. However,
in the discharge, because the sheath electric ﬁeld given by Eq.(2) is
always reﬂecting electrons, the electrons never enter the region of the large sheath electric
ﬁeld, which is opposite to the case of obliquely incident waves.

≈

The calculations based on the two-step ion density proﬁle model is known to yield dis-
charge characteristics in good agreement with experimental data and full-scale simulations
[12].

Throughout this paper, linear theory is used because the plasma-sheath boundary ve-
locity and the mean electron ﬂow velocity are small compared with the electron thermal
velocity [4,5]. The important spatial scale is the length scale for phase mixing, lmix = VT /ω.
The sheath width satisﬁes 2Vsh0/ω << lmix because Vsh << VT . Therefore, the sheath width
is neglected, and electron interactions with the sheath electric ﬁeld are treated as a bound-
ary condition. The collision frequency (ν) is assumed to be much less than the discharge
frequency (ν << ω), and correspondingly the mean free path is much larger than the length
scale for phase mixing. Therefore, the electron dynamics is assumed to be collisionless. The
discharge gap is considered to be suﬃciently large compared with the electron mean free
path, so that the inﬂuence of the opposite sheath is neglected. The eﬀects of ﬁnite gap width
are discussed in Ref. [13].

The electron interaction with the large electric ﬁeld in the sheath is modelled as collisions
with a moving oscillating rigid barrier with velocity Vsh(t) = dxsh(t)/dt. An electron with

Vsh is the electron velocity relative to the oscillating rigid barrier. From
where
Eq.(5) it follows that, if the function g(u′) is stationary, then (Psh = 0) there is no collisionless
power deposition due to electron interaction with the sheath [7, 14]. For example, in the limit
of a uniform ion density proﬁle nsh = nb, g(u′) is stationary (in an oscillating reference frame
of the plasma-sheath boundary), and the electron heating vanishes [4]. Indeed, in the plasma
bulk the displacement current is small compared with the electron current, and from Eq.(1) it
follows that the electron mean ﬂow velocity in the plasma bulk, Vb(t) =
nb,
is equal to the plasma-sheath velocity Vsh(t), from Eq.(3). Therefore, the electron motion
in the plasma is strongly correlated with the plasma-sheath boundary motion. From the
electron momentum equation it follows that there is an electric ﬁeld, Eb = m/e dVb(t)/dt,
in the plasma bulk. In a frame of reference moving with the electron mean ﬂow velocity,
the sheath barrier is stationary, and there is no force acting on the electrons, because the
mdVb(t)/dt = 0). Therefore, electron
electric ﬁeld is compensated by the inertial force (eEb −
interaction with the sheath electric ﬁeld is totally compensated by the inﬂuence of the bulk
electric ﬁeld, and the collisionless heating vanishes [4].

As the electron velocity is modulated in time during reﬂections from the plasma-sheath
boundary, so is the energetic electron density (by continuity of electron ﬂux). This phe-
nomenon is identical to the mechanism for klystron operation [16]. The perturbations in
the energetic electron density yield an electric ﬁeld in the transition region adjusted to the
sheath.

The electron velocity distribution function is taken to be a sum of a stationary isotropic
part f0(u) and a nonstationary anisotropic part f1(x, u, t). f1 is to be of the form f1(x, u, t) =
f1(x, u) exp(

Fig.2. For x > 6VT / ω, the electric ﬁeld proﬁle is no longer a simple exponential function,
similar to the case of the anomalous skin eﬀect [17]. The three components of current
corresponding to the ﬁrst, second, and third terms in Eq. (15) are shown at the bottom
in Fig.2. The ﬁrst term describes the current (jtr) driven by the electric ﬁeld E1(x) under
the assumption of specular reﬂection at the boundary. The second term relates the current
(jsh) of the energetic electrons owing only to a velocity change due to reﬂections from
the large sheath electric ﬁeld. The third term describes the current (jb) driven by the
uniform electric ﬁeld Eb under the assumption of specular reﬂection at the boundary. Due
to the boundary condition of specular reﬂection in Eq. (7), both of the currents jb and
jtr are equal to zero at x = 0. Also, both of the currents jtr and jsh vanish at x >
15VT / ω due to phase mixing, and the only current left here is jb. In contrast to large x,
at small x << VT / ω the total current is entirely due to energetic electrons interacting
with the sheath jsh. Indeed, the energetic electrons enter the sheath region with velocity
distribution fsh(u′). The electron current is given by the sum of the contribution from the
electrons approaching the oscillating barrier and from the electrons already reﬂected from
−∞ u′fsh(u′)du′. Because fsh(u′) = fsh(2Vsh −

calculation the contribution to the density by electrons with velocity u < Vsh0 is omitted.
R
Their contributions are second-order eﬀects in Vsh0/VT , which are neglected in the present
study [15]. Therefore, in the sheath region, when electrons are present, and in the nearest
vicinity of the sheath all current is conducted by the energetic electrons. As can be seen

The diﬀerence in phase of the currents of the energetic and low energy electrons was
observed in Ref. [6], but it was misinterpreted as the generation of electron acoustic waves.
Electron acoustic waves can be excited if the denominator of the right-hand side of Eq. (18)
has a pole at frequency ω, which corresponds to the root of the plasma dielectric function,
ε = 1 + 4πiσ(k)/ω. For a Maxwellian electron distribution function, the pole does not exist
4πe2nb/m is the electron plasma frequency. But the electron
for ω << ωp, where ωp =
acoustic waves can exist if the plasma contains two groups of electrons having very diﬀerent
temperatures [18]. The wave phase velocity is ω/k =
Th/m , where nc and nh are
the electron density of cold and hot electrons, respectively, and Th is the temperature of the
hot electrons. The electron acoustic waves are strongly damped by the hot electrons, unless
nc << nh and Tc << Th , where Tc is the electron temperature of the cold electrons [18]. In
the opposite limit, nc > 4nh, the electron acoustic waves do not exist [18]. In capacitively-
coupled discharges, the electron population does stratify into two populations of cold and
hot electrons, as has been observed in experiments and simulation studies [19,20]. Cold
electrons trapped in the discharge center by the plasma potential do not interact with the
large electric ﬁelds in the sheath region and have low temperature. Moreover, because of
the nonlinear evolution of plasma proﬁles, the cold electron density is much larger than the
hot electron density [20]. Therefore, weakly-damped electron acoustic waves do not exist
in the plasma of capacitively-coupled discharges. Reference [6] used the ﬂuid equation and
neglected the eﬀect of collisionless dissipation, thus arriving at the wrong conclusion about
the existence of weakly-damped electron acoustic waves.

Figure 4 shows the dimensionless power density as a function of nb/nsh. Taking into
account the electric ﬁeld in the plasma (both Eb and E1) reduces the total power deposited
in the sheath region. Interestingly, taking into account only the uniform electric ﬁeld Eb
gives a result close to the case when both Eb and E1 are accounted for. The electric ﬁeld E1
redistributes the power deposition from the energetic electrons to the low energy electrons,
but does not change the total power deposition (compare Fig.3 and Fig.4). Therefore, the
total power deposition due to sheath heating can be calculated approximately from Eq. (31),
taking into account only the electric ﬁeld Eb. This gives

The result of the self-consistent calculation of the power dissipation in Eq.(34) diﬀers from
the non-self-consistent estimate in Eq.(22) by the last term in Eq.(34), which contributes
corrections of order nsh/nb to the main term.

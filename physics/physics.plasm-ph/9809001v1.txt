Abstract.
The solar core, because of its density and temperature, is not a weakly-
interacting or a high-temperature plasma. Collective eﬀects have time scales comparable to
the average time between collisions, and the microﬁeld distribution inﬂuences the particle
dynamics. In this conditions ion and electron diﬀusion is a non-Markovian process, mem-
ory eﬀects are present and the equilibrium statistical distribution function diﬀers from the
Maxwellian one. We show that, even if the deviations from the standard velocity distribu-
tion that are compatible with our present knowledge of the solar interior are small, they are
suﬃcient to sensibly modify the sub-barrier nuclear reaction rates. The consequent changes
of the neutrino ﬂuxes are comparable to the ﬂux deﬁcits that constitute the solar neutrino
problem.

The solar neutrino problem is one of the most interesting long standing puz-
zle of the modern physics. The discrepancy between the combined results from
the solar neutrino experiments (Homestake, GALLEX, SAGE, Kamiokande and Su-
perKamiokande) and the predictions of the standard solar models (SSM) combined to
the minimal standard electroweak model has suggested the hypothesis that neutrinos
could have small masses and the lepton ﬂavor is not conserved [1, 2]. Because the
neutrino oscillation theory has far-reaching consequences for both particle physics and
cosmology, it is of great importance to ask whether the solar neutrino problem can
be solved, or at least alleviated, in the framework of the conventional physics [3].

The aim of this contribution is to show that the physical characteristics of the
solar core (the plasma parameter Γ = (Ze)2/(akT ), where a is the interparticle av-
erage distance, the collisional frequency νc and the electric microﬁeld intensity and
distribution) indicate the presence of long-range many-body interactions and memory
eﬀects. Therefore, the appropriate equilibrium distribution function of the ions and
electrons deviates respect to the usual Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution, which
is recovered in the weakly-interacting limit. These small deviations are ampliﬁed by
the barrier penetration mechanism yielding non-negligible modiﬁcations of the solar
neutrino ﬂuxes [4].

Nuclear reaction rates in the solar interior (SI), which has a plasma parameter
Γ ≈ 0.1, can be enhanced or suppressed depending on the behavior of the high-
energy tail of the equilibrium distribution function of such weakly non-ideal plasma.
Similar eﬀects are expected in other environments characterized by plasma parameters
0.1 <∼Γ <∼1, e.g., recombination and nuclear rates in brown dwarfs, Jupiter core and
stellar atmospheres.

In the SI the conditions required by the Debye-H¨uckel are only approximately
veriﬁed. The plasma frequency νpl is of the same order of the collisional frequency νc:
νpl ≈ νc ≈ 3−6×1017 sec−1 and the screening radius is of the order of the interparticle

distance. In addition to many-body collisional eﬀects, electric microﬁelds are present.
The distribution and the ﬂuctuations of these microﬁelds must be carefully considered,
since it modiﬁes the usual Boltzmann kinetics.

In the SI all these eﬀects that can modify the Boltzmann kinetics are not very
strong, contrary to the case of strong interacting Coulomb plasmas (Γ > 1) [5].
Therefore, corrections to the usual MB distribution are small and aﬀect mainly the
more energetic particles. Physical quantities that depend on integrals over the entire
distribution are almost unaﬀected. However, nuclear reactions are strongly aﬀected,
when they receive the main contribution from the high-energy tail of the distribution,
because of the Coulomb barrier.

In general, small deviations from the MB equilibrium distribution can always be

asymptotically described by [6]

where ˆδ is the Clayton parameter [7]. In particular, it has been shown [6, 4] that, if
one expresses the small corrections to the usual kinetics by a suitable power expan-
sion of the diﬀusion and drift coeﬃcients in the Fokker-Plank equation, the leading
modiﬁcation of the distribution is indeed given by Eq. (1).

In a more general context, when deviations are not necessary small, it is necessary
to generalize the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics and to include the possibility of non-
extensive thermostatistics. Tsallis has recently developed a statistical framework that
naturally includes long-range interactions and non-Markovian memory eﬀects [8]. The
particle velocity distribution predicted by this theory is

where Θ is the Heaviside step-function, and the parameter q can be connected by
expansion to ˆδ: q = 1 − 2ˆδ. In the limit q → 1 the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is
recovered.

A speciﬁc physical model for the microscopic processes in SI that produces the

above equilibrium distribution is outlined in the following.

Each particle is aﬀected by the total electric ﬁeld distribution due to the other
charges in the plasma. The random electric microﬁelds are often expressed in term of
the dimensionless parameter F as hE 2i = (F e/a2)2, where 4πa3/3 = 1/n; the distri-
bution of F in plasmas depends on the value of Γ [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. These microﬁelds
have in general long time correlations, and can generate anomalous diﬀusion.

The total microﬁeld can be decomposed in three main components. (i) A slow-
varying (relative to the collision time) component due to the collective plasma os-
cillations, which the particle sees as an almost constant external mean ﬁeld E over
several collisions. (ii) A fast random component due to particles within a few Debye
radii, whose eﬀect can be described by an elastic diﬀusive cross section σ1 ∼ v−1.
When only this cross section is present, the distribution remains Maxwellian even
in presence of the slow mean ﬁeld E. (iii) A short-range two-body strong Coulomb
eﬀective interaction, that can be described by the ion sphere model [5]. The strict

enforcement of this model as implemented by Ichimaru [5] yields the elastic cross sec-
tion σ0 = 2πα2a2, where a is the interparticle distance, α an adimensional parameter
whose order of magnitude can be inferred from the parameter F that characterizes
the microﬁelds, F ≈ α−2. Since F 2 ∼ 3/Γ ≈ 40, for Γ = 0.07, one can estimate
0.4 < α < 1. In the present model, it is this component of the electric ﬁeld that turns
out to be mainly responsible of the correction factor exp [−ˆδ(E/kT )2].

In this framework, the stationary solution of the kinetic equation valid for small

deviations from the MB distribution can be shown to be:

While we presented only a speciﬁc model, it is already suﬃcient to introduce the kind
of mechanisms that modify the MB distribution. It is especially important to study
the time and spatial correlation of the microﬁelds, and how the physical phenomena of
interest, e.g., subbarrier nuclear reactions, generate the appropriate scale separation
of the random ﬁeld contributions.

The presence of even a tiny deviation from MB in the solar core produces large
changes of the subbarrier nuclear reaction rates and, consequently, of the predicted
neutrino ﬂuxes. Following the general homology relationships for the variations of
physical inputs, see for instance Ref. [2], we can estimate the eﬀect of the non-Maxwel-
lian distribution on the ﬂuxes [4]:

Rj =

= e

−ˆδj βj ,

Φj
Φ(0)
j

for the ﬂuxes j = 7Be, 8B, 13N and 15O, while we use the solar luminosity constraint to
determine the pp ﬂux, Rpp = 1+0.087×(1−RBe)+0.010×(1−RN )+0.009×(1−RO),
and keep ﬁxed the ratio ξ ≡ Φpep/Φpp = 2.36 × 10−3. The power index βj, that
compares in Eq. (7), depends from the nuclear reaction considered and its value has
been taken from Ref. [2]. In principle, there could be a diﬀerent parameter ˆδj for each
reaction and it should be possible to calculated them from the speciﬁc interactions
in the solar plasma core. For the purpose of estimating the possible eﬀects of this
mechanism on the solar neutrino ﬂuxes, we used two simple models where δj were
used as free parameters.

In the ﬁrst model, we have used the same ˆδ for all the reactions; the best ﬁt
to the experimental data give ˆδ = 0.005 with a corresponding χ2 = 35.
In the
second model, we have ﬁtted two diﬀerent ˆδ’s, one (ˆδ(17)) for the the p + 7Be reaction
and the other (ˆδ(34)) for the 3He + 4He reaction. The best result gives χ2 = 20
with ˆδ(17) = −0.018 and ˆδ(34) = 0.030. The negative value of ˆδ(17) means that the
corresponding distribution has an enhanced tail and that the p + 7Be reaction rate
increases.

In spite of the fact that the values of χ2 are much smaller than the ones in the
SSM (χ2
SSM > 74), they are still large: this mechanism cannot solve the solar neutrino
problem. The best values of ˆδ are of the order of the ones found using Eq. (6) with
α ≈ 0.4 and Γ ≈ 0.07, and they have been found not incompatible with the constraints
from helioseismic observations [14]. Even if ˆδ is small, it has non-trivial consequences
on the neutrino ﬂuxes: the boron (beryllium) ﬂux can change of as much as 50%
(30%).

In conclusion we have shown that it is plausible that the equilibrium velocity
distributions in SI are not Maxwellian and they could follow from Tsallis statistics.
The parameter ˆδ that characterizes the generalized distribution is related to the mi-
croscopic collective processes in the plasma. In particular, it is of great interest to
consider the inﬂuence of the random electric microﬁelds on the diﬀusion processes,
and the possibility of characterizing their eﬀects by average quantities (mean ﬁelds
and cross sections) over diﬀerent scales.
In the future, one needs detailed studies
of the time (memory eﬀects) and spatial correlations of these microﬁelds. Although
these eﬀects cannot by themselves solve the solar neutrino problem, they can produce
large changes of the predicted ﬂuxes and should be taken into account when looking
for other solutions to the solar neutrino problem.

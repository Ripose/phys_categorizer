Abstract

Nonlinear set of equations for inertial or slow shear Alfv´en wave (SSAW)
in ideal electron-positron-ion (e-p-i) plasmas are presented. The analytical
solution for arbitrary amplitude SSAW in such multi-component plasmas
is obtained using Sagdeev potential approach. The numerical solutions for
several diﬀerent cases have also been presented for illustrative purpose.
It is found that the electron density dips of SSAW are formed in the su-
per Alfv´enic region. The amplitude and the width of the nonlinear shear
Alfv´en wave reduces with the increase in the concentration of positrons in
electron-ion (e-i) plasmas. The width of the soliton also depends upon the
direction of propagation of the perturbation in both e-i and e-p-i plasmas.

I. INTRODUCTION

The solitary kinetic Alfv´en wave (KAW) was studied in electron-ion (e-i)
plasmas by Hasegawa and Mima [1] long ago. These waves can propagate in
moderate-β plasmas for me
) < 1. The phase velocity of the KAW
mi
is less than the thermal speed of the electrons and hot electrons are assumed
to be inertialess and follow the Boltzmann distribution. Later on the nonlinear
coupling of KAW and ion acoustic wave (IAW) in e-i plasma was studied by Yu
and Shukla [2]

In low-β (< me

) plasma, the electron inertia cannot be ignored and the
wave propagation is slowed down. The phase velocity of Inertial or slow shear
Alfv´en wave (SSAW) is larger than the thermal speed of the electrons. The
nonlinear (SSAW) was studied in e-i plasma with β < me
about two decades
mi
ago [3] using Sagdeev potential approach. The conditions for the existence of
localized solitary solutions were discussed. The linear dispersion relation of
SSAW in e-i plasmas is ω2 = v2

<< Ωi
due to ion polarization drift under low frequency assumption i.e.,
(where Ωi = eB0

mic is the ion-gyrofrequency).

During the last decade, there has been a great deal of interest in electron-
positron-ion (e-p-i) plasmas and a number of authors [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
have studied diﬀerent linear and nonlinear wave propagation phenomenon in
such sytems. The e-p-i plasmas are supposed to exist in active galactic nuclei
(AGN), pulsar magnetospheres and early universe etc.[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The
positrons are introduced in e-i plasmas for the purpose of diagnostics and to
model the pulsar magnetosphere in laboratory experiments [11, 12, 13] In this
paper, we show that the presence of positrons in e-i plasmas can change the
nonlinear dynamics of low frequency slow shear Alfv´en wave signiﬁcantly. Or
we may say the other way round, that presence of ions in e-p plasmas can change
both the spatial and temporal scales. Therefore it seems important to study the
linear as well as nonlinear phenomenon in e-p-i plasmas to explain some aspects
of laboratory or astrophysical e-p-i plasmas.

Recently kinetic Alfv´en wave (KAW) has been studied in electron-positron-
ion (e-p-i) plasmas by Saleem and Mahmood [10]. In this case, the electrons and

positrons have been assumed to be inertialess and they follow the Boltzmann
distribution. The ions are considered to be inertial and cold. The phase velocity
of the wave is less than the thermal speed of both the electrons and positrons.
The polarization drifts of electrons and positrons can be ignored in e-p-i plasmas
and the ion polarization drift is necessary to maintain quasineutrality conditions.
The paper has been presented in this manner. In Sec. II nonlinear equations
for Inertial or SSAW in e-p-i have been deﬁned. The localized stationary solution
in the form of energy integral equation has been obtained in Sec. III. Some of
the possible numerical solution are presented in Sec. IV. In Sec. V discussion
on the obtained results is presented.

II. SET OF EQUATIONS

Let us consider a cold electron-positron-ion (e-p-i) plasma in the presence of
external magnetic ﬁeld B0 = B0 ˆz along z-axis. The governing equations for the

The continuity equations for electrons and positrons can be written as,

whereas the equations of motion for electrons and positrons along ˆz-axis are,

where j = e, p and qj =

which is the same linear dispersion relation of Inertial or slow shear Alfv´en wave
(SSAW) in e-i plasmas which has already been studied in Ref.
[2]. It can be
seen from Eq.(8) that the wave dispersion due to electron inertial length in the
presence of positrons is modiﬁed because of the factor p. So the positron density
can have signiﬁcant eﬀect on the wave dynamics in nonlinear regime as well.

IV. NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS

The numerical solutions of Eq.(25) are obtained for solitary structures in
the absence as well as in the presence of positrons in e-i plasmas. The Sagdeev
potential in the presence of positron (as a third species) in two component e-i
plasmas becomes complicated and the third integral term does not have simple
analytical solution. However, the numerical solutions exist and the plots of
the Sagdeev potential ’V ’ vs normalized electron densities ’ne’ corresponding
to p = 0.2 (dashed curve) i.e., for e-p-i plasmas as well as corresponding to
p = 0 (solid curve) i.e., e-i plasmas for M = 1.2, Kx = 0.1 have been shown
in Fig.1. The corresponding electron density dips have been shown in Fig.2
for the same parameters as given in Fig.1.
It can be seen from the ﬁgures
that the amplitude and the width of solitary structures reduces with increase in
percentage of positrons in e-i plasmas. The normalized density proﬁles of three
species electron-positron-ion plasmas are shown in Fig. 3.

The eﬀects on the direction of propagation on the solitons for both the cases
e-i and e-p-i plasmas are shown in ﬁgures 4 and 5, respectively. The plots for
diﬀerent directions of propagation i.e., for Kx = 0.1 (solid curve) and Kx = 0.3
(dotted curve) for two component e-i ( p = 0) plasmas and for Kx = 0.1 (dotted
curve) and Kx = 0.3 (solid curve) in three component e-p-i (p = 0.2) plasmas
for the same value of M = 1.2 have been shown in ﬁgures 3 and 4. It can be seen
from the ﬁgures that propagation direction eﬀects on the width of the solitary
structures. The width of the solitary structure increases with the increase in
the obliqueness of the wave.

The dependence of Mach number on soliton corresponding to M = 1.6 (solid
curve) and M = 1.2 (dotted curve) for same p = 0.2, Kx = 0.1 has been shown
in Fig.6. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the Mach number has signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the amplitude as well as on the width of the solitary structure. The
wave amplitude increases and the width decreases with the increase in Mach
number.

V. DISCUSSION ON RESULTS

We have studied the solitary pulse formation of inertial or slow shear Alfv´en
waves in electron-positron-ion plasmas. The conditions on the Mach number for
the formation of such nonlinear structures in e-i plasmas were presented long
ago [2]. It was predicted that super Alfv´enic density depletion regions can be
formed in e-i plasmas corresponding to an arbitrary amplitude perturbation.
However the density proﬁles were not plotted and the dependence of the non-
linear structures on the propagation direction was not investigated. We have
noticed that the pulse width increases with the increase in obliqueness (with re-
spect to the external magnetic ﬁeld) of the propagation direction in e-i plasmas
as shown in Fig.4.

It is pointed out that the conditions for the formation of solitary pulses in
e-p-i plasmas due to large amplitude SSAW perturbation are similar to the e-i
case. That is the density depletion regions can be formed in the super Alfv´enic
region i.e, for 1 < M . But the amplitude of the soliton decreases with the
increase in the number density of positrons. This result is very common in e-p-i
plasmas. For example the amplitudes of the solitary ion acoustic [5] and solitary
kinetic Alfv´en waves[10] also decrease with the increase in the concentration of
positrons in e-i plasmas.

In principle, the Alfv´en waves can have a wide range of temporal and spatial
scales in e-p-i plasmas because the frequency of the linear wave can vary from
ω = vAikz (with ω < Ωi) to ω = vApekz (with ω < Ωe,p), where vAep = ( B2
1
8⊼n0m )
2
(where me = mp = m) is the Alfv´en wave speed, and correspondingly the spec-
trum of wavelengths can be broader. These variations in the temporal and
spatial scales depend upon the concentration ratios of diﬀerent species. There-
fore it seems interesting to analyze the linear and nonlinear wave propagation
in such plasmas.

Here, we have studied only the Inertial or slow shear Alfv´en waves in e-p-i
plasmas which propagate on ionic time scale. It may be mentioned that the
limiting case of e-p plasmas can not be obtained from our equations because we
have ignored the polarization drifts of electrons and positrons. Our ﬁndings can
be useful to explain some aspects of laboratory and astrophysical space e-p-i
plasmas situations.

Abstract

Two-dimensional ﬂuid simulations of interchange turbulence for geometry and parameters relevant for

the scrape-off layer of conﬁned plasmas are presented. We observe bursty ejection of particles and heat

from the bulk plasma in the form of blobs. These structures propagate far into the scrape-off layer where

they are lost due to transport along open magnetic ﬁeld lines. From single-point recordings it is shown

that the blobs have asymmetric conditional wave forms and lead to positively skewed and ﬂat probability

distribution functions. The radial propagation velocity may reach one tenth of the sound speed. These

results are in excellent agreement with recent experimental measurements.

Recently, several experimental investigations have revealed a strongly intermittent nature of

particle and heat transport in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of magnetized plasmas [1, 2, 3]. There

are strong indications that this is caused by localized structures in the form of plasma “blobs”

propagating radially far into the SOL. It has been suggested that this is due to the dipolar vorticity

ﬁeld caused by vertical guiding center motions in plasmas in non-uniform magnetic ﬁelds [4],

reﬂecting the compressibility of the diamagnetic current. An outstanding challenge is to give a

self-consistent description of the emergence and evolution of such structures, which also capture

their statistical properties. Here an attempt towards this goal is presented, yielding favorable

agreement with experimental measurements. This is achieved by focusing on the collective two-

dimensional dynamics perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld while using a simpliﬁed description of

particle and heat losses to limiters or end plates along open ﬁeld lines.

Some of the most prominent features of experimental single-point measurements are the pres-

ence of asymmetric conditional wave forms as well as strongly skewed and ﬂat probability distri-

bution functions (PDF’s) of the density and temperature signals [1, 2, 3]. Simple interpretations as

well as advanced imaging techniques give a picture of ﬁeld-aligned blobs or ﬁlaments propagating

out of the bulk plasma with radial velocities up to one tenth of the sound speed. These highly

non-linear thermal structures have amplitudes which signiﬁcantly exceed the back-ground levels.

The associated intermittent transport may have severe consequences for magnetic conﬁnement ex-

periments by producing large heat bursts on plasma facing components. A change of sign in the

asymmetry of the ﬂuctuation time series PDF close to the last closed ﬂux surface (LCFS) indicates

that the structures are generated by a “ﬂapping” of the edge pressure gradient, ejecting blobs of

excess particles and heat out of the bulk plasma [1]. The blob structures thus seems to be generated

close to the LCFS and subsequently propagate far into the SOL, where they are subject to strong

damping due to parallel losses. This separation of driving and damping regions in conﬁguration

space has been discarded in several previous studies of SOL turbulence [5, 6].

In this Letter we present a novel model for interchange turbulence in slab geometry and nu-

merical solutions in qualitative agreement with experimental measurements. The model geometry

comprises distinct production and loss regions, corresponding to the edge and SOL of magnetized

plasmas. The separation of these two regions deﬁnes an effective LCFS, though we do not include

magnetic shear in our model. In the edge region, strong pressure gradients maintain a state of

turbulent convection. It is demonstrated that a self-regulation mechanism involving differential

rotation leads to a repetitive expulsion of hot plasma into the SOL, resulting in asymmetric con-

2

ditional wave forms, strongly non-Gaussian probability distributions and signiﬁcant cross-ﬁeld

transport by localized objects.

Assuming cold ions and neglecting electron inertia effects, a three-ﬁeld model may be derived
for quasi-neutral electrostatic perturbations of the full particle density n, electric potential f and

electron temperature T . Using the Bohm normalization and slab coordinates with

z along the

magnetic ﬁeld we obtain [7],

Note that Fp is essentially a measure of the domain integrated convective thermal energy trans-

port, while Fv shows that structures tilted such as to transport positive poloidal momentum up the

gradient of a sheared ﬂow will sustain the ﬂow against collisional dissipation [8, 9, 10].

In the following we present results from numerical simulations of the interchange model using

parameters relevant for SOL plasmas. The dimensions of the simulation domain is Lx = 2Ly = 400

and the LCFS is located at xLCFS = 100. The parameters used for the simulation presented here are
e = 0.25, z = 10−3, and the collisional diffusion n = 5 × 10−3 is taken to be the same for all

ﬁelds. The parallel loss rate of temperature is assumed to be ﬁve times stronger than that on the
W = s T /5 = 10−3/2p q, since primarily hot electrons are lost through
density and vorticity, s n = s
the end sheaths [11]. The damping rates s n and s
correspond to losses along one connection
length 2p R0q with the acoustic speed cs, where q = 3 is the safety factor at the edge. Finally, the
radial line-integral of the sources Sn and ST equals 0.2, and the shape of the sources and parallel
loss coefﬁcients shown in Fig. 1 are given by d = 16 and x = 2. For the numerical solution we

have employed an Arakawa scheme for the advective non-linearities and a third order stifﬂy stable

scheme for the time integration [7]. The spatial resolution is 512 and 256 grid points in the radial
and poloidal directions, respectively, and the total time span of the simulation is 4 × 106.

In Fig. 2 we show the typical evolution of the particle conﬁnement P and heat conﬁnement H

in the edge and SOL regions, deﬁned by

and similarly for the heat conﬁnement H. From the ﬁgure we observe that plasma and heat gradu-

ally builds up in the edge at the same time as it is decaying in the SOL region. This is repetitively

interrupted by rapid changes in which plasma and heat is lost from the edge to the SOL. More than

20% of the edge plasma may be lost during individual bursts. Also note from the ﬁgure that the

normalized heat conﬁnement is much less than the particle conﬁnement due to the larger loss rate

in the SOL region of the former. Further insight is revealed by Fig. 3 which shows the evolution

of the kinetic energy contained by the mean and ﬂuctuating motions, confer Eq. (1), as well as the

collective energy transfer terms deﬁned in Eq. (2). From the ﬁgure we observe that the convective

energy and thermal transport appears as bursts during which particles and heat are lost from the

edge into the SOL region. As discussed in Refs. 8, 9, 10, this global dynamics is caused by a

self-regulation mechanism in which kinetic energy is transfered from the ﬂuctuating to the mean

components of the ﬂows, and subsequently damped by collisional dissipation. As the thermal con-

ﬁnement is allowed to vary, this results in characteristic sawtooth oscillations [8]. Note, however,

the clear demonstration in Figs. 2 and 3 that thermal energy is ejected in a bursty manner from the

edge and into the SOL region, where it is eventually lost by transport along open ﬁeld lines.

The time-averaged proﬁles of the plasma density and the mean poloidal ﬂows are shown in

Fig. 4. Parallel losses in the SOL region result in average proﬁles peaked inside the LCFS, and

weakly decaying throughout the SOL. Also shown in Fig. 4 are typical instantaneous proﬁles

during a quiet period (tquiet) and during a burst (tburst). We observe signiﬁcant deviations from the

average proﬁles, with a more peaked density proﬁle in the edge region during quiet phases. During

bursts there is a substantial increase of the density proﬁle in the SOL region due to the convective

plasma transport. The temperature proﬁles have a similar structure but with lower amplitudes due

to the larger loss rate. The self-sustained poloidal ﬂow proﬁles are strongly sheared in the edge

region, and have larger amplitudes during the the strong ﬂuctuation period. This ﬁgure clearly

indicates that ﬂuctuations are driven in the strong pressure gradients in the edge region.

The statistics of single-point recordings at different radial positions Pi indicated in Fig. 1 com-

pletely agree with experimental measurements. In Fig. 5 we present the probability distribution

functions of the density signals taken from a long-run simulation containing more than a hundred

burst events. The ﬂat and strongly skewed distributions indicate the high probability of large pos-

itive ﬂuctuations corresponding to blobs of excess plasma. The skewness and ﬂatness factors take

values up to 3 and 15, respectively, except for the outermost radial position (P7) where very few

structures arrive. At the other points the PDF’s have similar structure with a pronounced expo-

nential tail towards large values, a characteristic feature of turbulent convection in the presence of

sheared ﬂows [8, 9].

The conditionally averaged temporal wave forms calculated from the same signals, using the

trigger condition n > 4nrms at each individual point, are presented in Fig. 6. An asymmetric wave

form with a sharp rise and a relatively slow decay, as observed in experimental measurements, is

5

clearly seen [1, 2, 3]. The maximum density excursions signiﬁcantly exceed the background level,

and decay rapidly as the structures propagate through the SOL. The number of realizations for the

conditional averaging decreases gradually from 125 at the innermost probe to 2 at the outermost

one. Using a negative amplitude for the conditional averaging results in very few realizations,

again showing the presence of blob-like structures. From two-dimensional animations and simple

statistical correlation measurements we further ﬁnd that the radial propagation velocity of these

structures is typically about one tenth of the sound speed but with a large statistical variance. This

is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements [1, 2, 3].

In Fig. 7 we show the spatial structure of the density, temperature, vorticity and electrostatic

potential during a quiet period and during a burst. These correspond to the same times as the

instantaneous proﬁles shown in Fig. 4. In the quiet period there are only weak spatial ﬂuctua-

tions with the plasma and heat well conﬁned within the LCFS. During bursts we observe strong

structures in all ﬁelds, which have propagated far into the SOL. Notice again the much weaker

perturbation in the temperature ﬁeld as compared to the density due to the difference in the par-

allel loss rates. Moreover, while blob-like structures are observed for the density and temperature

ﬁelds, the vorticity displays a roughly dipolar structure as expected from theory and experimen-

tally measured [1, 4].

In this Letter we have proposed a new model for interchange turbulence and demonstrated that

its numerical solutions are in good agreement with that reported from experimental investigations

of SOL turbulence and transient transport events [1, 2, 3]. An important feature of our model

is the spatial separation between forcing and damping regions which has not been accounted for

in previous studies [5, 6]. While our model does not in detail describe the transition region be-

tween closed and open magnetic ﬁeld lines, its solution clearly demonstrates a sound mechanism

for the origin and nature of intermittent transport in the SOL of magnetized plasmas. Our work

veriﬁes the present experimental working hypothesis in terms of ﬁeld-aligned blob-like structures

propagating far into the scrape-off layer, which was recently questioned by Sarazin et al. [5]. The

blob-like transport results in strongly skewed and ﬂat PDF’s and asymmetric conditional wave

forms. This is caused by a “ﬂapping” of the edge pressure proﬁle, ejecting blobs of excess par-

ticles and heat out of the bulk plasma. The excellent qualitative agreement between simulation

data and experimental observations gives strong conﬁdence that the two-dimensional structure in

potential, vorticity, density and temperature of the blobs reveals the actual spatial shape of these

blobs as occurring in experiments.

Abstract

A new kinetic theory Boltzmann-like collision term including correlations is pro-

posed. In equilibrium it yields the one-particle distribution function in the form of a

generalised-Lorentzian resembling but not being identical with the so-called κ dis-

tribution frequently found in collisionless turbulent systems like space plasmas. We

show that this distribution function satisﬁes a generalised H-theorem, yields an ex-

pression for the entropy that is concave. Thus, the distribution is a ‘true’ thermody-

namic equilibrium distribution, presumably valid for turbulent systems. In equilib-

rium it is possible to construct the fundamental thermodynamic quantities. This is

done for an ideal gas only. The new kinetic equation can form the basis for obtaining

a set of hydrodynamic conservation laws and construction of a generalised transport

theory for strongly correlated states of a system.

I. INTRODUCTION

Statistical mechanics is based on kinetic theory. Classical statistical mechanics derives from

Boltzmann’s equation which is the evolution equation for the one-particle phase-space distribution

function f (p, q, t). The Boltzmann equation itself results from the BBGKY hierarchical correla-

tion expansion of the Liouville equation where the particular collision term is assumed to contain

short range interactions only and all orders of correlations are neglected. In kinetic equilibrium the

Boltzmann collision term has as solution the celebrated Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function

fB as the basic distribution function of classical equilibrium statistical mechanics and thermo-

dynamics. These equilibria are characterised by the action of Boltzmann’s H-theorem (e.g., [1])

proving that the time evolution of the thermodynamic system tends towards maximum Boltzman-

nian entropy SB[fB]. Both H-theorem and entropy are functionals of the Boltzmann distribution,

SB[fB] being the fundamental thermodynamic function. In the past, generalisations of this entropy

to quantum statistics of Fermions and Bosons have been very successful. In addition other quan-

tum generalisations have been proposed to fractional statistics of anions by Haldane [2–4] and

others. These generalisations were mostly based on probability counting statistics.

The function fB has been widely used without justiﬁcation to even describe collisionless equi-

libria or as the initial state of the evolution of collisionless systems. Final states of such systems

are often described in terms of a perturbation analysis as solutions of a velocity space diffusion

process governed by the Fokker-Planck equation for which sometimes it can be demonstrated that

a H-theorem similar to Boltzmann’s exists as well. Such a situation as in quasilinear theory can be

taken as justiﬁcation for the validity of the perturbation approach. However, in collisionless sys-

tems containing strong correlations and consequently exhibiting interactions on all scales typical

for strongly turbulent systems and phase transitions the Fokker-Planck perturbation approach may

become invalidated. Such systems sometimes cannot be subordinated to Boltzmannian statistical

mechanics. Moreover, measurements of velocity space and energy distribution functions in realis-

tic natural systems frequently exhibit properties that are distinctly different from diffusive Fokker-

Planck solutions [5–7]. The observed (classical) distribution functions frequently asymptotically

2

exhibit extended high energy tails of a certain nearly constant slope −κ, with κ an arbitrary pos-

itive real number that is limited from below. Such distributions have been tentatively named κ

distributions and have been used in the past for interpretational purposes [9] as well as for formal

derivations [10,11], investigation of the dispersive properties of κ-plasmas [12,13] and calculation

of their thermal ﬂuctuation levels [14,15].

All these facts lead to the question if not in collisionless systems equilibrium states may (pos-

sibly temporarily) evolve that are distinctly different from Boltzmann equilibria. In fact, given a

system containing some sufﬁciently large amount of free energy and being nearly collisionless,

i.e. having a certain very small collision frequency νc, the evolution of the system will during its

initial state be entirely independent of the presence of collisions between its particle constituents.

Instead it will undergo an instability, i.e., the free energy will drive some of the fundamental eigen

modes of the system unstable. As a consequence, the amplitudes of these modes will grow from

their thermal level until they assume ﬁnite values, and the system will evolve into some previ-

ously non-existent structure. Since collisions are very rare for times t < τl ∼ 1/γl ≪ τc ∼ 1/νc

comparable to the linear time τl ∼ 1/γl, with γl the linear growth rate, the system behaves ini-

tially linearly. The eigen-mode amplitudes grow exponentially until becoming large enough that

the linear approximation breaks down. The system then enters into its non-linear state.

Let us assume that this state is quickly reached such that collisions are still unimportant. The

further evolution of the system will then be determined by various non-linear effects like wave-

wave interactions, wave-particle and non-linear wave-particle interactions, generation of anoma-

lous collisions when the particles are scattered at the waves etc. In short, the system becomes

turbulent. The large-amplitude eigen-modes excite sideband waves, local inhomogeneity is intro-

duced, and the system evolves into a state of coexistence of many different mutually interconnected

scales affecting each other. The total power in the system will, in this state, start to behave ﬂuctuat-

ing, possibly still growing and reorganising the system continuously. Assume the non-linear time

still being much shorter than the collision time, τnl ≪ τc. For collisions still being negligible, this

state may last for a certain possibly long turbulent time t ∼ τT < τc. Such an evolution is sketched

in Figure 1.

3

The intermediate nonlinearly turbulent state represents a thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium

state different from the purely stochastic thermodynamic equilibria described by the correlation-

free Boltzmann statistical mechanics. Since the state is a quasi-equilibrium state, it should possess

an equilibrium distribution function f (p, κ) 6= fB(p) that is different from fB, and in addition

its entropy should be approximately constant such that it assumes an intermediate approximate

maximum for the time interval τnl < t ∼ τT < τc. Clearly, when the ﬁnal state of the system is

approached at time t ∼ τc, the system becomes collisional, and binary collisions will destroy the

intermediate turbulent quasi-equilibrium. After t > τc, stochasticity dominates over the turbulent

correlations, and the power contained in the turbulent ﬂuctuations is readily converted into heat.

The system then settles at its ultimate thermal equilibrium that is described by ordinary Boltzmann

statistical mechanics.

The free parameter κ introduced above heuristically describes the deviation of the turbulent

quasi-equilibrium distribution function from the Boltzmann distribution. It contains the informa-

tion about the actual turbulent processes and correlations in the system. In the absence of cor-

relations and scale-invariance it will behave in a way that the quasi-equilibrium distribution ap-

proaches the Boltzmann distribution. The motiviation for introducing κ follows the experimental

literature and is thus purely traditional. However, as will be shown below, it turns out to be nev-

ertheless practical. In a real turbulent system the entropy will still tend to increase slowly due to

weak internal turbulent dissipation processes, but in an approximate theory we may assume that

this increase is slow enough for the state to be considered stationary. These assumptions allow to

ask for the possible form of the quasi-equilibrium distribution function f (p, κ) and for the statis-

tical mechanics of the equilibrium state described by it.

The existence of a non-Boltzmannian statistical mechanics has been suspected since the obser-

vation of L´evy ﬂights (for an account of the current literature on this subject cf., e.g., [16]). L´evy

ﬂights have been suspected to affect plasma transport and diffusion. The random walks caused by

L´evy ﬂights have been shown to possess an approximate distribution function resembling the κ

distribution [17] though no ultimate theory of L´evy ﬂights is available yet. Beginning with Renyi

[18,19] intuitive but formal extensions of Boltzmann’s theory of the statistical entropy S have been

4

suggested in order to ﬁnd different concepts for the entropy as the basic thermodynamic function of

a modiﬁed statistical mechanics. A whole family of such formal generalisations could be imagined

not all of them being of physical relevance. More recently [20] a particular heuristic simpliﬁcation

of Renyi’s entropy has been proposed which seems to deserve some physical applicability but still

lacks a basic physical or probabilistic foundation. Among the applications proposed are diffusion

[21], hydrodynamic turbulence [22] and others. It has, moreover, been shown that the thermo-

dynamic formalism could be extended to this kind of entropy [22], and the ﬂuctuation-dissipation

theorem [23] could be formulated as well. A disadvantage of this theory is that it apparently allows

for a violation of the second law when entropic growth seems to be inhibited. Such a behaviour

is generally considered to be rather unphysical. Its advantage over Renyi’s original proposal is its

formal simplicity.

In this communication we construct the one-particle kinetic equivalent of the Boltzmann equa-

tion which forms the physical basis for a generalised-Lorentzian statistical mechanics. We demon-

strate that in thermodynamic equilibrium its solution is the real and positive deﬁnite generalised-

Lorentzian phase space distribution function

where ǫp = (p − p0)2/2m is the (non-relativistic) particle energy, µ the chemical potential that

is related to the fugacity z = exp βµ, and Aκ is a certain normalisation constant (extension to

the relativistic or to non-ideal cases including external force ﬁelds is then straightforward). The

Lagrangean multiplier β(T ) is a function of the temperature T of the system, which is the physical

observable, κ is a positive real valued but otherwise arbitrary number that can assume any positive

value κ ∈ R. For κ → ∞, the above distribution smoothly approaches the Boltzmann function fB.

II. THE LORENTZIAN COLLISION TERM

The ﬁnal step in the BBGKY kinetic theory of solution of the exact Liouville equation for a

many particle system is the one-particle kinetic equation for the one particle distribution function

f1(p1)

5

Lf1 = C(f1, f2)

(2)

where L ≡ ∂t + (p1/m) × ∇1 + ˙p1 · ∂p1 is the one-particle Liouville (Boltzmann) operator acting

in the one-particle phase space. The collision operator C on the right-hand side of Equation (2)

depends on the one and two-particle distribution functions f1, f2, respectively, as well as on the

particle number N. It is a very complicated functional that in principle traces back through the

entire hierarchy to the original N-particle Liouville equation. In order to arrive at any physically

useful solutions it must be approximated in some way. The most widely used approximations are

Boltzmann’s hypothesis of statistical independence of the interactions in any kind of collisions

and the collisionless assumption of Vlasov. The latter leads to the neglect of the collision term,

attributing all interactions to the action of the ﬁelds on the one-particle distribution function on the

left-hand side of Eq. (2). This assumption is very strong because even in the absence of any binary

one-particle collisions, the action of the ﬁelds and very weak higher-order collisions on the level

of the two-particle equation in the BBGKY hierarchy may result in a non-vanishing one-particle

collision term C. This term may contain residual correlations and may thus not necessarily be of

the correlation-free statistically independent Boltzmann form proposing that CB is a functional of

the product of two one-particle distribution functions only:

CB = CB[f1(1)f1(2)].

(3)

The form f1(i) stands for f1(pi, xi), where the index i designates the number of the particle in-

volved whose position in momentum and conﬁguration space are pi, xi. Its explicit form is

CB =

{f1(1′)f1(2′) − f1(1)f1(2)} ≡

{F [1′2′] − F [12]}.

(4)

dσ

The prime indicates the particles after the collision, with σ the collisional cross-section, and Ω the

solid angle of the collision. The cross-section depends on the elementary physics of the collision

process and has to be determined separately for the individual process in question. In central force

ﬁelds, it becomes the Boltzmann-Rutherford cross section. For purely ﬁeld-mediated interactions

it is a complicate function. However, in order to determine the distribution function fB in thermal

6

equilibrium, explicit knowledge of the differential cross-section is not needed. All that is required

is that dσ(Ω)/dΩ > 0 is positiv deﬁnite. This holds for any real physical process.

The molecular chaos assumption underlying Boltzmann’s theory refers to the absence of

all interactions between the particles other than binary with two-particle correlation function

F [12] ≈ f1(p1)f1(p2). It thus reduces to F [12] to the product of the two one-particle distribu-

tion functions f1(1), f1(2). In such an approach the binary interactions dominate on all scales and

for all times, an assumption that has turned out very fruitful in classical statistical mechanics.

However, as mentioned above, under certain conditions like scale-invariance this assumption may

become violated. Self-consistent ﬁeld ﬂuctuations may lead to long-range correlations in the sys-

tem and clustering of particles in groups that behave similarly on many different scales. Under

such conditions molecular chaos will be replaced by chaos on larger scales that are dominated

by correlations among the particles. Clearly, such interactions depend crucially on the particular

kind of correlation induced, and the general behaviour of the system becomes very difﬁcult to

investigate.

There are two primary effects caused by such correlations. The ﬁrst is a change in the differen-

tial cross-section. More important for our purposes here is the change induced in the two-particle

correlation function F [12] in the collision integral (4). Without explicit knowledge about the par-

ticular turbulent process it seems that little more could be said. However, in a ﬁrst approach to

a statistical theory one may follow Boltzmann’s approach and assume that even in the turbulent

regime the one-particle distribution function still satisﬁed the lowest-order kinetic equation of the

BBGKY hierarchy, i.e., Boltzmann’s equation (2), but now with different (turbulent) collision term

CT =

dΩ

Z

dΩ

{G[1′2′] − G[12]}

(5)

that takes into account the correlations via the turbulent so far unspeciﬁed correlation functional

G[12]. In this expression the positive deﬁnite turbulent differential cross-section σT contains the

supposed interactions between the clustered groups of particles at different scales formally in

the same way as in Boltzmann’s case. The explicit form of the cross-section is not of primary

importance for our purposes in the following. Its calculation for particular cases will be delayed

7

to elsewhere. Its nature to be a collisional cross section guaranties its positive deﬁniteness. This is

all we need here in developing an equilibrium theory.

The turbulent conglomerates behave like superparticles. If this is the case, one can model the

two-particle correlation function as the uncorrelated product of functionals g[f1] of the one-particle

distribution function tentatively describing the approximately uncorrelated interaction of the su-

perparticles formed by the long range correlation of the particles in the system. The underlying

assumption in this approach is that the long-range correlations become very weak on a sufﬁciently

large scale such that the molecular chaos assumption holds again if the scale is chosen sufﬁciently

large. In other words, the assumed scale-invariance must be broken at sufﬁciently large scales.

This is certainly a valid assumption for most physical systems. Then we can write

G[12] ≃ g[f1(1′)]g[f1(2′)] − g[f1(1)]g[f1(2)].

(6)

In accord with the previous discussion, higher order correlations are neglected in this represen-

tation. The so far unspeciﬁed mechanism of how the cluster conglomerates and congregates are

formed and which part of the phase space is occupied by each of them is thereby buried in the

particular functional form of g[f1].

III. CORRELATION FUNCTIONAL AND EQUILIBRIUM DISTRIBUTION

Our primary task is to ﬁnd an analytic expression for the functional g[f1]. Clearly, any rigorous

theory should derive g[f1] from the Liouville equation or at least from the kinetic equation for

the two-particle correlation function f2, i.e. from the second-lowest order equation in the BBGKY

hierarchy. Here we follow a more heuristic elementary approach.

Let us assume homogeneous force-free equilibrium conditions such that df1/dt = 0. The

Boltzmann equation then requires that the collision term (5) vanishes identically. A sufﬁcient con-

dition for this to happen is that the correlation functional

G[12] = 0.

(7)

8

This requirement does not depend on the explicit form of the differential cross section as long as

the latter is positive deﬁnite, as we have assumed. It is thus a very general assumption holding for

any equilibrium theory. Taking the logarithm of G[12] yields

ln g[f1(1′)] + ln g[f1(2′)] = ln g[f1(1)] + ln g[f1(2)].

(8)

This expression corresponds to Boltzmann’s equilibrium condition with the only difference that

it is now demanded to be satisﬁed by the functionals g[f1] instead of the distribution function f1

itself. However, because the underlying interaction between the particles remains to be determin-

istic, g must be a function of the constants of motion only, viz. particle number and energy. Thus

the general solution to the above equation is

ln g[f1(p; κ)] = −β[(p − p0)2/2m − µ],

(9)

where β, µ are two arbitrary real constants, and p0 is the initial average momentum of the particles

of mass m that they may have possessed in common. The constant µ somehow takes care of the

conservation of the particle number. In addition we introduced the free parameter κ on that g[f1]

may also depend, κ playing the role of a control parameter that characterises the particular nature

of the correlations caused by the speciﬁc long range processes in the medium. The functional g

hereby turns out to be an exponential function of the particle energy. In order to ﬁnd its functional

dependence on f1, it should be inverted for f1. This is not possible without any further assumptions.

One of these assumptions can be based on our additional knowledge that in the limit of molecular

chaos the Boltzmannian statistical mechanics must be recovered. We, hence, liberately demand

that in the limit κ → ∞ the functional g[f1] should become the identity functional

κ→∞ g[f1(p; κ)] = I[f1(p; 1)] = fB(p).
lim

(10)

This requirement can be taken as a guideline in the search for the functional form of g[f1].

Let us assume that the one-particle distribution function has been normalized to one. This

assumption is easy to satisfy for any given distribution function since the physical interpretation

of the distributions is to be a probability distribution function. The simplest possible function g[f1]

that satisﬁes the above condition is

9

g[f ] = exp {κ[1 − f −1/κ]},

κ ≤ ∞,

(11)

where we dropped the index 1 for simplicity, since from now on we will understand f = f1 as

the one-particle distribution function. It is easy to check that (11) actually becomes the identity

functional for the free parameter κ → ∞. There may be other functional forms as well which

satisfy (10). However, in view of the free parameter κ, Eq. (11) is the simplest choice one can

make.

In order to ﬁnd the equilibrium distribution function f (p, κ), we invert Equation (11) and

combine the result with Equation (9). This procedure yields

f (p, κ) = Aκ

1 +

[(p − p0)2/2m − µ]

β
κ

(

−κ

,

)

(12)

where Aκ takes care of the proper normalisation of the distribution function. Taking the limit κ →

∞ one again easily checks that limκ→∞ f → fB, and this distribution becomes the Boltzmann

function in the large-κ limit. Hence, f (p, κ) from (12) solves the equilibrium one-particle kinetic

equation (2) with the new collision term (5) including turbulent correlations.

The new distribution function is a κ-generalised Lorentzian function similar to those particle

distributions that have been measured in space plasmas [5,6]. It may also apply to L´evy ﬂight

statistics. It contains three free parameters, κ, β and µ. The limit κ → ∞ suggests that β = 1/kBT

can be identiﬁed with the kinetic temperature of the system under consideration, while the so far

unspeciﬁed free parameter µ is the chemical potential. For κ ≪ ∞ this chemical potential itself

becomes a function of κ. Moreover, for ﬁnite κ, unlike the Boltzmann case, it does not drop out of

the distribution function but is retained suggesting that ﬁnite-κ systems do not behave like normal

statistical systems but possess an internal chemical potential that affects the addition or extraction

of particles.

Before proceeding to the next sections where we prove that the above distribution function

f (p, κ) describes a real thermodynamic equilibrium, we note that the free parameter κ necessarily

satisﬁes a number of restrictions imposed on it by the requirement that the equilibrium distribution

function f (p, κ) must conserve the particle number and average energy of the particles in the

system. A naive inspection of (12) may suggests that κ > 1. Below we will show that actually

10

κ > 5/2 for an ideal gas, which is a much stronger restriction on κ. We also note once more that

κ implicitly contains all information about the real turbulent dynamics of the system. Calculation

of κ from elementary processes thus is a very difﬁcult task. Some effort has been given to it in

a simple plasma interaction model [24] where it had been shown that κ was a function of the

nonlinear dispersion relation of the plasma. However, a perturbation approach as used there may

be justiﬁed only in very particular cases.

IV. THE MEANING OF THE CORRELATION FUNCTIONAL

In this section we investigate the nature of the somewhat mysterious correlation functional g[f ].

Without the construction of either the full microscopic turbulent interaction theory or solution of

the next higher order kinetic equation in the BBGKY hierarchy it is hardly possible to precisely

determine why g[f ] has just the structure as given in Eq. (11). We can, however, show that g[f ]

necessarily contains many correlations. We write

ln g[f ] = κ(1 − f −1/κ) = −κ

1 − f 1/κ
f 1/κ

.

Since f is a probability distribution and 0 < f < 1, the second form of this expression suggests

the use of a simple summation formula in order to obtain

From here the correlation functional can be written as an inﬁnite product

This expression shows very clearly that g[f ] for ﬁnite κ is a product of inﬁnitely many exponentials

of all powers of the distribution function. It therefore contains all kinds of correlations on all scales.

On the other hand, returning to ln g[f ], we may realise that Eq. (14) can be expressed as an inﬁnite

chain fraction. Because f < 1, one can expand the chain fraction and rewrite it as

.

This approximate form shows that in the very lowest approximation the collision integral assumes

a form similar to Boltzmann’s taken to the power 1/κ. Hence, even to the lowest approximation

the correlation scale is modiﬁed in a κ-system. Of course the discussion presented here is only

qualitative, and the last expression is not valid in the limit κ → ∞ in which case one has to return

to the full expressions given above. But it shows that even an expansion of the exponentials does

not remove the difﬁculties introduced by the multi-scale correlations in the system. Hence, a per-

turbation analysis cannot reproduce neither the new distribution function nor any κ-distribution. A

more fundamental microscopic theory must either take advantage of renormalisation group analy-

sis methods or use ﬁnite particle number numerical simulations in order to elucidate the underlying

physical interactions. These are obviously highly nonlinear and contain many interacting scales.

V. H-THEOREM AND ENTROPY

Having derived the equilibrium distribution function, we proceed to demonstrate that the new

correlation statistical mechanics also obeys a H-theorem. In analogy to Boltzmann we deﬁne the

H-function as

H(t) ≡

dV f ln g[f ] =

dV κ(f − f 1−1/κ),

(20)

with dV the phase-space volume element. Differentiating with respect to time t, we arrive at

In equilibrium df /dt = 0, and hence dH/dt = 0, H = const assumes a constant value. It can also

be shown that under time-dependent condition not deviating too far from equilibrium this value is

monotonically approached, and dH(t)/dt ≤ 0.

where H ′ is obtained from H by exchanging primed and unprimed variables. The functional





derivatives in (22) are simply equal to the powers f −(1+1/κ) of the corresponding distribution

functions. It is then simple matter to show that the integrand in (22) can never be positive, and that

H is a monotonically decreasing function of time, if only κ ≤ ∞, which proves the H-theorem

for these values of κ. It is, however, important to note that the functional derivative term in (22)

increases the negative derivative of the H function and thus accelerates the tendency towards ther-

mal equilibrium. This behaviour is not unexpected, because the long range correlations should

enhance the dissipation of free energy. In other words, the correlations contribute an additional

amount to the entropy. The system always tends towards equilibrium and never departs from it by

itself unless it is disturbed from the outside and free energy is added to it.

The H-theorem permits for an easy deﬁnition of the entropy ST of the system. But before

reading it from Eq. (20) we present some physical argument.

There are several ways of constructing the entropy of the system. For brevity we refer to

Eq. (9). Note that this equation is linear in the particle energy ǫ(p) (for simplicity, we drop the

translational momentum p0 at this place). Performing the ensemble average on both sides, we

obtain

hln g[f ]i = −β (hǫ(p)i − µ) = ln g[f (hǫi)]

(23)

13

This result suggests that in analogy to the deﬁnition of Boltzmann’s entropy (e.g., [27]) the new

turbulent κ-entropy is deﬁned as the ensemble average over the logarithm of the functional g[f ]:

ST [f (p; κ)] = −kB

d3pf (p; κ) ln g[f (p; κ)].

(24)

Z

Z

It thus turns out that the functional g[f ] plays the role of the probability distribution of states in

the phase space that has been deformed to some extent by the action of the long-range correla-

tions. This entropy is still an additive quantity, but it is g[f ] and not f itself that determines the

distribution of states. Inserting for g[f ], one immediately obtains the following representation of

the entropy (actually, this is the entropy density of the system)

ST [f (p; κ)] = −kBκ

d3pf (p; κ)(1 − f (p; κ)−1/κ).

(25)

Up to the dimensional factor kB, this is just the negative of the H-function, and we conclude

immediately that dST /dt ≥ 0. The entropy can only increase.

In order to be in concordance with the second law, the entropy must in addition be a concave

function. It is indeed simple matter to show that this is the case for the above deﬁnition of the

entropy. Assume two independent distribution functions f1, f2 (indices do not refer to one- and

two-particle distributions, here, but merely designate two different one-particle distributions). It

then follows from Eq. (24) that

Remember that 0 < f < 1. The extra term on the right-hand side of this expression is always

The above deﬁnition of the entropy resembles Tsallis’ [20] proposal of a non-extensive entropy.

In fact, one can show that the two are indeed related. Assume Nk particles to be distributed on τk

quantum states in the phase space volume element, ∆pk∆qk. The number of particles in state k

is Nk = f (κ)τk. Resolving the integral in (25) into a sum using this re-interpretation of f (κ), the

entropy becomes

which is a slightly rewritten version of Tsallis’ deﬁnition of ST for κ < ∞. In this representation

Tsallis’ distinction between his cases q < 1 and q > 1 disappears and leaves the only physically

reasonable case κ < ∞. Moreover, because the entropy is the logarithm of the statistical weight,

Ωκ, we can identify

as the fundamental ‘thermodynamic weight’ function. As in conventional statistical mechanics,

Ωκ can be written in terms of a product of the statistical weights of the k states

One easily conﬁrms that for κ → ∞ this becomes the correct Boltzmann statistical weight when

identifying ln N Nk

k

as the large-Nk limit of ln Nk!. Hence, Eq. (29) contains a large Nk approxi-

mation. At the current stage it is not easily possible to resolve this approximation and to recover

the correct form of the κ-statistical weight. The form of Ωκk given in (29) shows that the state

counting process underlying the κ-generalised statistical mechanics is highly complicated by the

dominance of the correlations. Obviously, the correlations contract the phase space to a reduced

volume that may consist in a strange attractor, for instance. The degree and process of contraction

is hidden in the exact value of κ, as well as in the above statistical weight function.

Because Ωκk contains the information about the ways of how the particles can be distributed

in the k states (with degeneracy τk), it also tells that for κ 6= ∞ the distribution procedure is no

simple stochastic process. Interestingly, Eq. (27) corresponds to the deﬁnition of fractal dimen-

sions through the natural measure of strange attractors νi = limt→∞(θi/t), where θi is the fraction

of time a certain volume element i on the basin of the attractor is visited by the orbits. Given a

resolution η, one may write for the multi-fractal dimension

Dκ = lim

[I(κ, η)/ ln(1/η)] ,

(30)

where we deﬁned the information (neg-entropy) I(κ, η) = −

νi ln g[νi], and N(η) is the

number of intervals of lengths η to cover the attractor (cf., e.g., [25,26]). Note that κ is not a

P

natural number here. Since νi is a probability measure, one recognises that Nk/τk corresponds to

the natural measure of the attractor, which in the continuous case is taken over by f (κ). This points

on a close connection between the underlying nonlinear dynamics and the Lorentzian statistical

mechanics developed in the present communication. For κ → ∞ one recovers the information

dimension

while due to the boundedness of κ ≥ κm from below, the limit κ → 0 does not exist. This implies

that the box-counting dimension is never realised. The multi-fractal dimensions are limited from

above by Dκ ≤ Dκm.

VI. IDEAL GAS

With the above instrumentation at hand one can investigate the behaviour of the ideal κ-gas.

Normalising the distribution function Eq. (1) to the particle number density N/V , we ﬁnd Aκ =

The latter function is interpreted as the grand partition function. It depends on the particle number

N, volume V , the chemical potential µ and temperature functional β(T ), κ and on Planck’s con-

stant h. In order to ﬁnd the entropy of the ideal gas one carries out the integration in Eq. (25). The

is the κ-modiﬁed quantum density. It requires some nontrivial algebra to demonstrate that this

expression actually becomes the classical Boltzmann entropy in the limit κ → ∞, and that nQκ

tends to approach nQ. The above expression also suggests that in an ideal κ-gas the Boltzmann

constant is modiﬁed and depends on the correlation properties of the gas through κ. This makes

κ a sensible function of the macroscopic properties of the gas. In particular, κ(T ) will depend on

the temperature T because it is suspected that for T → ∞ the medium should become totally

disordered. In this case limT →∞ κ → ∞, and classical Boltzmann statistics will apply again.

In order to complete the formalism we identify the thermodynamic potential of the ideal gas

of two-fold interest. It shows that the chemical potential of an ideal κ-gas is negative because the

quantum density is always considerably higher than the average density. Implicitly we had made

this assumption already in calculating the entropy when we assumed that the phase-space integrals

would converge when integrating over the interval 0 ≤ p < ∞. Positive chemical potentials may

not be excluded, however, in non-ideal gases. In such cases the theory becomes naturally more

involved. The most important observation is that the control parameter κ is bound from below by

κ > 5/2.

(38)

This limitation requires that the ﬂattest physically possible distribution functions can only have

slopes larger than 2.5 in energy space. It is interesting to note that observed distribution functions

17

seem to satisfy this condition. Extension to non-ideal gases are straightforward. One simply re-

places ǫp = H with the full one-particle Hamiltonian H of the system including all interaction

potentials. However, due to the complicate form of H, approximation methods are needed in this

case in order to calculate the thermodynamic functions and velocity moments. Generalisation to

the relativistic case requires the substitution ǫp = mγr(p)c2, where γr is the relativistic factor. In

this way the present theory has all the potentialities of a kinetic theory. A further generalisation to

the quantum case [28] will be published elsewhere.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a generalisation of the Boltzmann equation to some special class of colli-

sion term that is not based on binary collisions. Rather it takes into account long-range correla-

tions between the particles. The equilibrium state of such systems is described by a generalised κ

Lorentzian distribution function with κ not necessarily being a rational function and being limited

from below. It is also described by a particular form of the (turbulent) entropy ST . We believe that

in collisionless systems close to criticality when long-range correlations dominate such thermo-

dynamic equilibria will be realised. In future work is has to be shown, however, if and how the

proposed collision term can be derived from the BBGKY hierarchy. So far justiﬁcation [5–7] is

given mainly by the surprisingly frequent experimental observation of κ-like distributions in colli-

sionless space plasmas. Their high-energy tail slope generally agrees with the theoretical bound on

κ found here. Observed deviations at lower energies may be the result of different effects, not the

least is the appearance of the chemical potential µ in the theoretically correct distribution which is

not taken care of in the experimental ﬁts.

The present analysis leaves open a large number of questions that are related to the formal

application of the Lorentzian statistical mechanics to non-equilibrium processes, to its microscopic

justiﬁcation, as well as to the identiﬁcation of the underlying process of state countings. At the

present state of the theory it seems not easily possible to conclude about the counting procedure.

Clearly, the correlations acting on all scales do not permit for a simple random distribution of

18

states as in Gibbs-Boltzmann statistical mechanics. It may be suspected that therefore the phase-

space will not homogeneously be visited by the system under such conditions. Only the strange

attractor is visited frequently during the evolution of the system while large holes may exist in

phase-space which are never even touched. In quasi-equilibirum the system will repeat to circulate

on the strange attractor but even its coverage will not be homogeneous during the available time

t < τc. It thus does not so much surprise that the statistical weight Ωkκ turns out to be an extremely

complicated expression.

As has been pointed out earlier in this paper any microscopic justiﬁcation of the new statisti-

cal mechanics must identify the non-linear process. A more formal possiblity is to return to the

second-lowest kinetic equation in the BBGKY hierarchy, the equation for the two-particle distri-

bution function f2[12], and to solve it under appropriate assumptions as for instance the neglect of

collisions and correlations in this state. Such a solution should probably yield a non-trivial colli-

sion integral that in the most general case will include correlations. It should be of considerable

interest to determine, under which conditions this collision term can be brought into the form

heuristically proposed in the present communication. Another possibility is to use few-particle

numerical simulations and to determine the structure of the distribution function when performing

very many experiments with slightly different initial conditions.

One of the fundamental questions concerns the meaning of the turbulent entropy ST . Actually,

the letter version of the present paper has been rejected from publication in Physical Review Letters

with the argument that it would make no sense to deﬁne a new entropy. It is clear, of course, that

there is only one entropy in the Universe, viz. disorder. However, the mathematical description

of disorder can nevertheless require different expressions to describe entropy growth in different

phases of the evolution of the system. In particular, under conditions when long-range correlations,

scale invariance, or strong nonlinearity dominate over collisionality entropy may obey different

laws than in Boltzmann statistical mechanics.

Aside from these basic questions the structure of the new kinetic theory and the quasi-

equilibrium distribution function lead to the important questions of the corresponding non-

equilibrium and transport theories. The boundedness of the control parameter κ from below im-

19

plies that only a limited number of ﬂuid moments can in practice be determined from the distri-

bution. What does this limitation imply? Does it hint on a self-closure of the turbulent system or

does it force us to invent a new kind of moment calculation? Intuitively it seems to be clear that

the particle number in the energetic tail of the Lorentzian distribution must be limited in order to

avoid a ultra-violet catastrophe. But what does it mean in reality? Obviously the number of parti-

cles in the tail is subject to self-limitation. Too many energetic particles may drive the system into

a stronger turbulence causing stronger scattering of the particles which may lead to bulk heating

and otherwise limitation of the energetic particle ﬂux. It is important to identify the actual process

that governs this limiting cycle. Only when this problem has been solved, a reliable transport the-

ory can be developed. One of its ingredients is the turbulent cross section. We have shown that it

is not important to be known for the determination of the equilibrium properties of the Lorentzian

gas. Knowing the distribution function the average cross section can be calculated subsequently.

This will be done in future work.

We ﬁnally point on the many possiblities of applications of the new theory to collisionless

thermodynamics, equilibria and stability processes, turbulence, radiation, and its extension to the

quantum regime. Some of these questions will be investigated elsewhere.

FIG. 1. Evolution of the power and entropy in a nearly collisionless system initially containing a sub-

stantial amount of free energy. The system evolves through four different stages, the linearly unstable state,

the nonlinearly unstable state, non-linear quasi-equilibrium into the ﬁnal collisional thermal equilibrium.

Pure stochasticity is reached only on this ﬁnal stage when Boltzmann statistical mechanics holds. The

non-linear quasi-equilibrium has slowly increasing entropy only and contains turbulent interactions on all

scales. During this state the system may be described by non-stochastic processes and unconventional statis-

tics taking into account long range interactions and correlations.

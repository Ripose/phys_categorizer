Energy calculation of magnetohydrodynamic waves and their

stability for viscous shearing ﬂows.

ABSTRACT

A self-consistent, thermodynamic approach is employed to derive the wave energy of a mag-

netohydrodynamic system within the harmonic approximation and to obtain the familiar

dispersion relation from the resulting equation of motion. The evolution of the system due

to an external perturbation is studied by a linear response formalism, that also gives the

energy absorbed by the magnetohydrodynamic system from the external ﬁeld. The calcu-

lated wave energy reveals the presence of positive and negative energy waves, that coalesce

together to give rise to Kelvin - Helmholtz instability of the system. The threshold value

of this instability changes only slightly in the presence of a small amount of viscosity, thus

precluding the dissipative instability of the negative energy waves. The prediction of such a

dissipative instability by earlier authors turns out to be the result of an erroneous choice of

the viscous drag force, that violates the fundamental law of Galilean invariance.

1. Introduction

Propagation of waves in a medium is the manifestation of the system’s response to a small

deviation from its local thermodynamic equilibrium. The dispersion relation D(k, n) = 0

describes the frequency (n) vs. wavenumber (k) relationship of such waves, and the form of

the dispersion function D(k, n) is decided by the restoring forces and the degrees of freedom

that the system possesses.

The degrees of freedom of a magnetohydrodynamic system consist of its density, pressure,

velocity and its magnetic induction. The conventional method of determining the stability

1

of the system and also the nature of its wavemodes, is to work with the (MHD) equations

connecting the above variables, thus obtaining the dispersion relation by requiring a non-

trivial solution of the problem (eg. Alfven 1950; Cowling 1957; Chandrasekhar 1961). This

method, though adequate to study the system’s stability, does not directly allow us to

calculate the energy of the system.

In this paper, we study the response of a magnetohydrodynamic system to an exter-

nal perturbation from the point of view of its energetics. The system consists of a two-

dimensional slab-like inhomogeneity in the plasma and the ﬂow parameters of an otherwise

uniform magnetic medium, so that the equilibrium pressure, density, magnetic ﬁeld and

velocity are given by

p0(z), ρ0(z), B0(z), u0(z) = 


p0o, ρ0o, B0o, u0o,

|z| ≤ d,


with the magnetic ﬁeld vectors and the steady ﬂows being aligned to the axis of the slab, ie.,

to the X-direction.The equilibrium condition demands that the plasma inside and outside

the slab are in the total (gas + magnetic) pressure balance, namely, p0o + B2

0o/8π = p0e +

B2

0e/8π. We here note, that Nakariakov and Roberts (1995; see also, Satya Narayanan 1991;

Nakariakov, Roberts and Mann 1996) analysed the normal modes of the above equilibrium

through the solutions of the slab’s dispersion relation. These authors also included plasma

compressibility in their analysis. Considering the algebraic complexity of the calculations of

the slab’s energetics, we here conﬁne ourselves to an incompressible slab.

In what follows, we begin with the basic deﬁnition of the energy density of a magneto-

hydrodynamic system, deriving ultimately an expression for the space-averged total energy

(Hamiltonian) of the perturbed MHD slab in terms of its generalized co-ordinates, namely,

its interfacial displacements η(x, z = ±d, t), and their time derivatives ˙η(x, z = ±d, t); see

Section 2. In Section 3, we derive the equation of motion of the perturbed slab from the given

Hamiltonian, which we solve directly to obtain the energy of excitation of the wavemodes.

The above calculation of the wave energy reveals the presence of negative energy waves

(NEW), the existence of which was predicted earlier by various authors in both the ordinary

hydrodynamic (eg. Benjamin 1963; Cairns 1979; Craik and Adam 1979; Ezerskii, Ostrovskii

and Stepanyants 1981; Ostrovskii and Stepanyants 1982; Craik 1985; Ostrovski, Rybak and

Tsimring 1986) and the magnetohydrodynamic (eg. Acheson 1976; Ryutova 1988; Ruderman

and Goossens 1995; Ruderman et al. 1996; Joarder, Nakariakov and Roberts 1997) systems.

The present paper improves upon these earlier calculations by extending the results of Cairns

(1979) to the much complicated magnetohydrodynamic situations, thus providing a simple

expression for the wave energy in terms of the linear dispersion function D(k, n) of the MHD

slab. In his derivation of the wave energy, Cairns followed a procedure that is somewhat

similar to the ones developed earlier by Stix (1962) and Witham (1974), and used the

expansion p1,2 ≈ D1,2

A(t) exp (ik0x − ωt) (see, Cairns 1979) for the pressures

across the interface of the ﬂuid. Such an expansion, though consistent with the dispersion

ω0 + i ∂

∂t , k0

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

relation, appears to us to be intuitively presented by Cairns. Our method, on the other

hand, gives rigourous calculations of all the physical parameters and, in addition, allows one

to calculate directly the energy of the system (Section 2), from which both the dispersion

relation and the wave energy follows, via. the equation of motion (see Section 3).

Along with many other properties, the negative energy waves are also supposed to ex-

ihibit dissipative instability, so that the waves become overstable in the presence of any

arbitrarily small amount of viscous dissipation in the medium that is in the rest frame of

these negative energy waves; cf. Kikina (1967); Weissman (1970); Cairns (1979); Ezerskii

et al. (1981); Ostrovskii and Stepanyants (1982); Craik (1985); Ostrovskii et al. (1986);

Ruderman and Goossens (1995); Ruderman et al. (1996). In this paper, we show that this

viscous overstability of the NEW is simply the result of an erroneous choice of the dissipative

damping, that violates the law of Galilean invarience. In Section 4, we show that both the

positive and the negative energy waves, in fact, exhibit dissipative damping under the ac-

tion of a viscous drag force, that is consistent with an appropriate Galilean transformation.

Concluding remarks are given in Section 5, indicating the relevance of this study to several

astrophysical MHD systems.

2. Total energy of the perturbed slab

2.1.The Perturbations: Consider then, that due to the action of some external stress, the

interfaces z = ±d of the magnetic slab (see the previous section) are displaced by an amount

η(x, z = ±d, t) = ˜η(k, z = ±d, t) exp(ikx), where ˜η(k, z = ±d, t) are the amplitudes of

the Fourier components of the displacements η(x, ±d, t) with respect to x, and k is the

3

wavenumber. The associated z-displacements of the media internal (|z| ≤ d) and extrenal

(|z| > d) to the slab are given by






˜η(k, z = −d, t) exp (ikx) exp {k(z + d)},

z < −d,

η(x, z, t) =

[α cosh (kz) + β sinh (kz)] exp (ikx),

|z| ≤ d,

(2)

˜η(k, z = d, t) exp (ikx) exp {−k(z − d)}, z > d,

thus showing that for an incompressible plasma slab, as is the case considered here, the

perturbation amplitudes ˜η(k, z, t) are evanescent in both the internal (|z| ≤ d, denoted by

‘o’) and the external (|z| > d, denoted by ‘e’) media away from the interfaces z = ±d of the

slab. Such perturbations pertain to the surface modes of the slab with the ‘cosh’ solution

in equation (2) presenting a kink (even) surface mode, and the ‘sinh’ solution presenting

a sausage (odd) surface mode; cf. Roberts (1981a, b), see also Edwin and Roberts (1982,

1983).

The coeﬃcients α and β in equation (2) can be evaluated from the condition of continuity

of the z-dispacements across the interfaces z = ± d of the slab. Retaining the above

terminology to reperesent the perturbations that are of even or of odd symmetry with respect

to the axis (z = 0) of the magnetic slab, we thus obtain

α = ˜ηkink(k, t)/ cosh (kd), ˜ηkink(k, t) = 1

2 {˜η(k, z = −d, t) + ˜η(k, z = d, t)} ,

β = ˜ηsausage(k, t)/ sinh (kd), ˜ηsausage(k, t) = 1

2 {˜η(k, z = −d, t) − ˜η(k, z = d, t)} .

(3)

So far, we considerd only the z-displacements of the magnetic plasma. The perturbations

in other magnetohydrodynamic variables can be obtained by applying equations (2) and (3)

to the linearized MHD equations (eg. Chandrasekhar 1961). In medium ‘o’ internal to the

slab, these ﬂuctiations are written as

2.2. The Energy Densities: To calculate the total energy (or, the Hamiltonian) of the mag-

netic slab, we ﬁrst note that, the energy density of an incompressible magnetohydrodynamic

system is given by (see the Appendix)

ε = p +

u2,

(6)

where, p = p0 + δp, B = |B| = |B0 + δB|, and u = |u| = |u0 + δu| are the total pressure,

the total magnetic ﬁeld strength and the total velocity of the medium, respectively. For the

speciﬁc situation considered here (see Section 1), we can now use equation (6) to write the

magnetohydrodynamic equations of motion in the following particular form:

that must be integrated, with the help of equations (4) and (5), to obtain the expressions

for the energy densities separately for each of the media internal (‘o’) and external (‘e’) to

the slab. Consider ﬁrst the internal (‘o’, |z| ≤ d) medium. Equation (4) then allows us to

evaluate the various terms on the left hand side of equation (7) upto the second order of

smallness in ˜η(k, t). Writing η (x, t) = ˜η (k, t) exp (ikx), we thus get,

(9)

Here, the quantities ε0o and Ko are constants of integration, that are independent of x



and z. The function δε0o(x, z, t) in equation (9) represents some initial ﬂuctuations in the

equilibrium energy density ε0o = p0o + B2

0o/8π + (ρ0o/2) u2

0o of the medium ‘o’, that are the

manifestations of some externally applied initial stress on the system. Such a stress does not

appear explicitly in equation (7), but is incorporated phenomenologically in equation (9) to

facilitate the study of the system’s response η(x, z, t) to such external perturbations δε0 in

Section 3.2 of this paper.

6

In what follows, we further consider the ﬂuctuations δε0(x, z, t) to have only a piece-

wise dependence on the z-locations; ie., for any particular value of x, the magnitudes of

δε0(x, z, t) may change abruptly across the interfaces z = ±d of the slab, but are constant

in each of the three media, namely, the medium ‘o’ inside (|z| ≤ d) the slab, and the

medium ‘e’ on either (z < d and z > d) side of the slab. For the medium ‘o’, we can write

δε0o(x, z, t) = δε0o(x, z = 0, t) in such a case.

Unlike ε0o and δε0o(x, 0, t), the quantity Ko in equation (9) contains terms, that are of

second order smallness in the amplitudes of the interfacial displacements ˜η(x, ±d, t). Such

second order terms do not follow from the linearized equation (8), but are ought to be

introduced, as we have to determine all the harmonic terms in the system. A general

expression for Ko can therefore be written as

Ko = a ˜η2

kink(k, t) + b ˜η2

sausage(k, t) + c ˜ηkink(k, t)˜ηsausage(k, t),

(10)

where, the coeﬃcients a, b and c must be determined separately from some physical con-

siderations. In order to determine these coeﬃcients, it is convenient to ﬁrst drop the term

ρ0ou0o (δuxo) from equation (9). Such terms do not contribute to the total Hamiltonian
H(˜η(k, ±d, t), ˙˜η(k, ±d, t)) of the system, as the integrals like ρ0u0

(δux) dz dx represent

the velocity of the centre of mass of the respective layers, and hence are identically zero

R R

owing to wave propagation. Unfortunately, this property of the integrals has to be imposed

and cannot be demonstrated here, as the linearization limit that we follow, introduces some

unphysical ˜η2(k, ±d, t) -type terms in the Hamiltonian of the system.

In order to identify the constants a, b, c in equation (10), we use now the condition of

equipartition. After dropping the term involving δuxo in equation (9), we next consider an

averaging of the energy density over a time-scale that is much longer than any periodicity

present in the system. Such an averaging retains only the second order terms on the right

hand side of equation (9), while all the terms linear in ˜η(k, ±d, t) drop out. By denoting

time averages by overbars, and by using the Parseval formula for Fourier transforms, we thus

obtain

where, the ‘+’ and the ‘-’ sign applies to the cases of the kink (with f (k) = tanh (kd)) and

the sausage (with f (k) = coth (kd)) perturbations, respectively.

To check the correctness of equations (16) and (18), we consider, for the time being,

that there is no external stress applied on the system, ie., ˜σ(−k, t) = 0. The motion of the

plasma slab then consists of its various eigenmodes, as revealed by its dispersion relations

D(k, n) = 0, connecting the frequency (n) and the wavenumber (k) of any temporal Fourier

component η(k, n) exp (int) of the displacements ˜η(k, t) of the slab. For the kink and the

sausage disturbances, these dispersion relations are obtained by substituting ∂/∂t = in in

equation (18). For arbitrary η(k, t), we thus obtain

in the two media ‘o’ and ‘e’, respectively.

We here note, that equation (19) is essentially the same as the dispersion relations ob-

tained by Nakariakov and Roberts (1995), for the normal modes of an incompressible mag-

netic slab embedded in an incompresible MHD medium, where there is a relative tangential

velocity between the slab and its environment. This equation admits solutions

(20 b)

Each of the kink (f (k) = tanh (kd)) and the sausage (f (k) = coth (kd)) solutions then

allows two distinct eigenmodes of the slab, that are represented by the ‘+’ and the ‘-’

signs in equation (20). These modes are purely oscillatory (giving surface waves) when the

discriminant of equation (20) is real, but one of them (the ‘+’ mode) becomes a growing

mode (giving Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability) when this discriminant is imaginary. The

instability thus sets in for relative velocities

|u0e − u0o| ≥ ckf / (αof αef )1/2 ,

(21)

ie., for values at which the ‘+’ and the ‘-’ surface modes of either the kink or the sausage-

type coalesce together in the real n vs. k plane to produce an unsatble region of complex

frequency; see Cairns (1979) for some examples of such coalescence instabilities drawn from

hydrodynamics. Such a coalescence instability occurs only when the modes involved have

energies of opposite sign; see the discussions in the next section. We also note, that equation

(21) reduces to the instability criterion given by Singh and Talwar (1994) and Nakariakov

and Roberts (1995) in a situation, where the plasma slab moves in a static environment, ie.,

when u0e = 0.

11

Equation (21) further shows, that the kink and the sausage modes merge together to give

only two (‘+’ and ‘-’) surface modes in the case of an inﬁnitely wide (kd → ∞, f (k) → 1)

slab, so that the quantity ckf coincides with the phase speed ck = (ρ0oc2

Ao + ρ0ec2

Ae)1/2/ (ρ0o + ρ0e)1/2

of the hydromagnetic surface waves (Roberts 1981a,b) in a single surface of discontinuity sep-

arating two uniform magnetic plasma media. The instability criterion reduces to the classi-

cal threshold for the K-H instability of a magnetic tangential discontinuity (Chandrasekhar

1961) in this limit of an inﬁnitely thick plasma slab.

3.2. Evolution of the System under External Stress: With this brief discussion on the nature

of the normal modes of the slab, we now turn to the calculations for the work done by an

external stress ˜σ(−k, t) in exciting each of these modes, which, in turn, is stored as the

energy of that particular wavemode of the system. To ﬁnd this wave energy, we consider

that the external stresses begin to act on the system at a time t = 0, so that

˜σ(kink/sausage) (−k, t) = ˜σ(kink/sausage)(−k)Θ(t)F (t),

(22)

with F (t) being an arbitrary function of time t, and Θ(t) being a Heaviside unit step function.

The causal response of the system to this external stress is given in terms of a response

function G(k, t). Thus

˜η(kink/sausage)(k, t) = 

(24)

with the superscript ‘L’ denoting a Laplace transform. The one-sided Fourier transform

η (k, ω) of ˜η (k, t > 0) can now be found from equation (24), by analytically continuing s to

iω, so that

η(kink/sausage)(k, ω) = ˜ηL

(kink/sausage)(k, iω) = GL

(kink/sausage)(k, iω)F L(iω).

(25)

12

With the help of equations (19) and (25), equation (18) yields

D(kink/sausage)(k, ω)GL

(kink/sausage)(k, iω)F L(iω) = k˜σ(kink/sausage)(−k)F L(iω),

(26)

whence we obtain

continuation. Thus

GL

(kink/sausage)(k, iω) = k˜σ(kink/sausage)(−k)/D(kink/sausage)(k, ω).

(27)

Equation (27) helps us to ﬁnd GL(k, s) for any complex value of s, by means of analytic

GL

(kink/sausage)(k, s) = k˜σ(kink/sausage)(−k)/D(kink/sausage)(k, −is),

(28)

which, combined with equation (24), ultimately gives the expression for the Laplace trans-

form ˜ηL

(kink/sausage)(k, s) of the displacements ˜η(kink/sausage)(k, t) for any complex value of s.

This expression is given as

(kink/sausage)(k, s) = k˜σ(kink/sausage)(−k)F L(s)/D(kink/sausage)(k, −is),
˜ηL

(29)

from which we can ﬁnd the time evolution of the displacements ˜η(kink/sausage)(k, t) by means

of Bromwich’s integral formula. Thus,

˜η(kink/sausage)(k, t) =

F L(s) exp (st) ds/D(kink/sausage)(k, −is), (30)

where, the real constant Υ is so chosen that the singularities of the integrand lie to the left

of the line s = Υ, the singularities themselves being of the nature of simple poles, that are

the solutions of the dispersion relations D(kink/sausage)(k, n) = 0. In the present case, these

singularities are s± = in±, with n± being simply the frequencies given in equation (20)

above.

To evaluate the integral given in equation (30), we need now to consider some particular

form of the function F (t) for the time dependent part of the external stress ˜σ(kink/sausage)(−k, t);

see, equation (22). A common model to choose is an exponential one, so that

13

F (t) = A exp (−λt),

(31)

with A being a constant, and the exponent λ being positive deﬁnite. For this particular

functional form of the external stress ˜σ(−k, t), equation (30) yields

on the MHD slab creates long lived excitations pertaining to the normal surface modes of the

slab, that have frequencies n+ and n− as given by the dispersion relations (20). Equation

(33) further shows that the two surface modes, denoted here by a ‘+’ and a ‘-’ sign, are

out of phase with the external stress ˜σ(−k, t) by π/2 and 3π/2, respectively. The modes

14

are of same amplitude, ie., |˜η+

(kink/sausage)(k, t)| = |˜η−

(kink/sausage)(k, t)|, but their diﬀerent phase

relations with respect to ˜σ(−k, t) lead to a diﬀerence in their respective energy absorption

rates, as will be presented in the next section.

3.3. Energy Absorbed by the Modes: Equation (33) shows that the rate of absorption

We here note that, inspite of the complexities presented by the magnetic ﬁeld, the ex-

pression of wave energy presented in equation (36) is essentially the same as the one given

in Cairns (1979) in the case of a purely hydrodynamic system. Unlike Cairns (1979), whose

method was intuitive (see Section 1 for details), we here derive our results directly from the

equation of motion (18) of the system. The particular models of external stress that we

assume for the purpose of demonstrations, do not have any bearing on our ﬁnal result in

equation (36), thus implying that this expression for the wave energy is truely a generalized

expression for any hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic system.

15

3.4. Waves of Negative Energy (NEW): Consider, for simplicity’s sake, a frame of reference

co-moving with the external medium, so that u0e = 0. Consider further, that the velocity of

the slab u0o is increased gradually from zero through positive values in this frame of reference.
Equation (20) in Section 3.1 then shows that, as long as u0o < ckf / (αof )1/2, both the ‘+’

and the ‘-’ modes present oscillatory surface waves with n+ < 0 and n− > 0, thus implying

that the ‘+’ wave propagates in the positive X-direction, whereas, the ‘-’ wave propagates
in the negative X-direction. As the value of u0o is increased through ckf / (αof )1/2, so that
ckf / (αof )1/2 < u0o < ckf / (αof αef )1/2, oscillatory surface modes still pertain, but now with

n± < 0, thus implying that both the ‘+’ and the ‘-’ waves now propagate in the positive
X-direction. Thus, with the increase of the slab speed past its critical value ckf / (αof )1/2,

the ‘-’ surface wave reverses the direction of its phase propagation to be simply carried by

the ﬂow. In other words, the ‘-’ surface wave changes its character from a forward wave to

a backward wave (eg. Ostrovskii et al. 1986). To examine the energetics of these surface

waves, we note from equation (36) that,

∆h(kink/sausage)(n±) = ±n± (n+ − n−)

(37)

1
k

|˜η±

(even/odd)(k, t)|2

so that,

and

∆h(kink/sausage)(n±) > 0, when u0o < ckf / (αof )1/2 ,

(38 a)

∆h(kink/sausage)(n+) > 0 and ∆h(kink/sausage)(n−) < 0,

when ckf / (αof αef )1/2 > u0o > ckf / (αof )1/2 .

(38 b)

The backward ‘-’ surface wave is then also a negative energy wave in this particular reference

frame - a result, that is in agreement with Cairns (1979), Ostrovskii et al. (1986) and Ryutova
(1988). As the velocity u0o of the slab passes through its threshold value ckf / (αof αef )1/2

for K-H instability, an unsatble region is produced by a coalescence of the positive and the

negative energy modes. We may note that, although the sign of energy of the modes depends

on the choice of the co-ordinate frame, the existence criterion of the unstable branch (see

16

equation (21)) is independent of such a choice. Also invariant is the total energy absorbed by

the system from the external perturbation. For a δ-function type perturbation, this energy

is given by (see equation 35)

∆h(kink/sausage) = ∆h(kink/sausage)(n+) + ∆h(kink/sausage)(n−) = k|˜σ(kink/sausage)(−k)|2,

(39)

which is less than the excitation energy ∆h(kink/sausage)(n+) of the ‘+’ mode alone in the above

example. This extra energy is released during the process of excitaion of a negative energy

wave, thus exciting simultaneously a positive energy wave through the mode interactions in

the presence of the external stress ˜σ(−k, t).

4. Eﬀects of viscosity on the wavemodes

To examine the eﬀects of viscous dissipation on the surface modes of the slab, we ﬁrst observe

that a canonical form of the stress-free equation of motion of the slab can be obtained by

substituting ∂/∂t for in in equation (20). This equation is

kf − αof αef (u0e − u0o)2 ,

(40 b)

in a frame ‘s’(say), in which the two ﬂuids ‘o’ and ‘e’ are seen to move with velocities
In this frame of reference ‘s’, a wave proﬁle ηs(x, z′, t) at any
u0o and u0e, respectively.

Consider now a frame of refernce ‘r’, that moves with a relative velocity ¯U with respect

to the ‘s’ frame, so that the transformation r→s is given by

(kink/sausage)(k, t) = ˜ηr

The slab waves in this ‘r’ frame thus possess a reﬂection symmetry, since δn is an invariant
that depends only on the relative velocity |u0e − u0o|, and not on the drift velocity ¯U.

While examining the eﬀect of viscosity on the surface modes of the slab, we must begin

our investigations by calculating the viscous dissipation as is seen in the reference frame

‘r’. This approach is in agreement with Rayleigh (1883), who argued that in a moving
stream ﬂowing with a velocity ¯U , the nett pressure ﬂuctuation due to viscous drag must be

δp = χd

φ − ¯U x
(cid:17)

(cid:16)

, as measured in the frame of reﬂection symmetry of the perturbations,

with χd being a viscous drag coeﬀecient and φ(x, z, t) being the velocity potential. In the

present case of the magnetic modes of the slab, this requires that the rate of mechanical

energy dissipation of the slab due to viscous damping (eg. Landau and Lifshitz 1959a) is

given by

with νe being the kinematic viscosity in medium ‘e’, whereas, medium ‘o’ is taken to be

inviscid. It is possible to use the classical gas dynamical formula for viscous dissipation (as

given in equation (43)), while retaining the velocity discontinuities at the slab interfaces,

only in such a situation, where either the internal or the external medium alone has viscous

dissipation and the other medium is inviscid, ie., the details arising due to boundary layer

may be ignored and the tangential discontinuity of the velocities at the interfaces still remains

a valid condition. We however note that, ideally one should consider an anisotropic viscous

stress tensor in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld (cf. Braginskii 1965), as in the situation

18

considered here. Whatever the case may be, the speciﬁc choice of the viscous stress tensor

is not expected to change the overall stability properties of the modes about which we are

mainly concerned in this paper.

We now substitute the expressions

The energy thus dissipated in frame ‘r’ gives rise to an increament δS0e in the entropy

of the system, that must be invariant in all frames. Noting that, δn in equation (45) is an

invariant (see, equation (40b)), we obtain the rate of increase of entropy (or, the heating
rate) in terms of the quantities deﬁned in the frame ‘s’. Thus, substituting δn = n + k ¯U, we

1967; Weissman 1970; Cairns 1979; Ezerskii et al. 1981; Ostrovskii and Stepanyants 1982;

Ostrovskii et al. 1986; Ruderman and Goossens 1995), in which the viscous drag force was

proportional to the frequency n of the waves in the observer’s frame ‘s’, thus depending on
the velocity ¯U of the material. In view of this important diﬀerence, it is here pertinent, that

we discuss the signiﬁcance of equation (49) in some detail.

20

The ﬂow of the two ﬂuids creates a momentum ﬂux ρ0ou0o + ρ0eu0e per unit volume in
the observer’s (‘s’) frame, that is equivalent to imposing a velocity ¯U = (αof u0o + αef u0e) on

all matter in the wave proﬁle. Moving to any other frame, where velocities of the ﬂuids are
u′
0o = u0o + u and u′
0e = ¯U + u. This nett velocity of
the wave proﬁle appears purely due to Galilean transformation, and should not contribute

0e = u0e + u, we have ¯U ′ = αof u′

to any process of exchange of energy or momentum within the system, and thus cannot

contribute to dissipation. Contrary to the earlier results, the expression for the viscous drag
must, therefore, have no explicit dependence on the drift velocity ¯U , as is evident by the
appearance of the invariant factor δn = n + k ¯U in the damping force in equation (49).

Returning to the modes of oscillations of the magnetic slab, equation (49) yields solutions

thus showing that, for ﬂow velocities below the threshold for the K-H instability, the principal

eﬀect of viscous dissipation is to introduce a damping for both the positive and the negative

energy modes of the magnetic slab - a result, that is in contradiction to the earlier results

(see the references above), which predict a dissipative instability for the negative energy

waves. The main consequence of our considering the correct Galilean transformation, while

examining the viscous eﬀects on the slab waves, is then the establishment of the fact that, the

stability property of the modes remains non-singular in the presence of a small dissipation,

that changes only slightly the threshold for the K-H instability of the slab, with the modiﬁed

5. Concluding remarks

Occurrence of magnetic structures is abundant in various astrophysical situations, such as in

the solar photospheric ﬂux tubes, or in the solar coronal plasma loops. Such magnetic struc-

tures are often associated with ﬁeld-aligned plasma ﬂows, with the velocities of these ﬂows

being diﬀerent inside the structures than those outside, thus producing shearing motions in

the plasma medium. Detailed understandings of the complex interactions of such shearing

ﬂows with the oscillatory motions of the structures are necessary to study accurately the

energy transport processes in astrophysics, such as the mechanisms of non-thermal energy

transport from the solar sub-surface layers to the upper solar atmosphere. Certain investiga-

tions have been carried out (eg. Ryutova 1988; Nakariakov and Roberts 1995; Nakariakov et

al. 1996; Ruderman and Goossens 1995; Ruderman et al. 1996; Joarder et al. 1997) in this

direction, that highlited the role of negative energy waves in such processes. As a further

contribution to such investigations, we here examined in detail certain speciﬁc aspects of

the interactions of magnetohydrodynamic waves with shearing ﬂows, and particularly of the

negative energy waves, by using a self-consistent thermodynamic approach. This approach

helped us to generalize the expression for the hydrodynamic wave energy given in Cairns

(1979) to magnetohydrodynamics (see, equation (36) in Section 3.3), thus enabling us to

calculate the energy of the hydromagnetic waves (of course in the harmonic approximation),

when the linear dispersion relations of such waves are known along with the observationally

obtained informations regarding the wave amplitudes. Once the wave energy is thus cal-

culated, equation (35) then guides us to obtain a rough estimate of the generating stresses

˜σ(−k, t) of the waves. Such estimates of the stresses may be of great importance in sev-

eral astrophysical situations, particularly in solar MHD cases, where such estimates may

provide us with some clues regrading the physical processes that may be taking place in

the sub-surface layers of the Sun, or in the regions of complex magnetic topology in the

solar atmosphere, about which we have very little direct observational evidence. Finally, by

incorporating viscosity, we obtain the dispersion relations (equation 49 in Section 4) which,

while precluding the possibility of dissipative instability,- sets the correct conditions for the

stability of the system (equation (51)) and also yields the time scales for the decay of the

disturbances in the surface modes of MHD systems. It is to be hoped, that the present study

22

would provide us with some guidance in gaining further physical insights into the complex

nature of the interactions between the magnetic ﬁeld and the ﬂuid ﬂows in various astro-

physical systems,- both for estimates in terms of energetics as also in the study of evolutions

of MHD eigenmodes.

Appendix. Energy density of an incompressible MHD plasma.

The energy density of an incompressible magnetohydrodynamic system is deﬁned as

ε (r, t) = εi (r, t) +

B2 (r, t)
8π

ρ0
2

+

u2 (r, t) ,

(A.1)

where, εi is the thermodynamic internal energy of the plasma, and the quantities ρ0, u and

B are as deﬁned in equation (2) of the main text.

In the present case, we consider the ﬂuid to be incompressible, and the hydrodynamic

processes to be adiabatic. In that case, we write (cf. Landau and Lifshitz, 1959b)

εi (r, t) = µ (r, t) /υ,

(A.2)

where, µ (r, t) is the local chemical potential of the system, and υ is its speciﬁc volume. Thus,

for any ﬂuctuation in the thermodynamic state of the system, we have

δεi (r, t) = δµ (r, t) /υ,

(A.3)

where, υ is a constant in an incompressible ﬂuid. Further,

δµ = −s dT + υ dp,

(A.4)

where, s is the speciﬁc entropy of the system.

If we now assume the electrical and the thermal conductivities of the ﬂuid to be inﬁnite,

and its viscosity coeﬃcient to be zero, then the system cannot support any thermal gradients,

and, therefore, δT is zero at all points. Combining equations (A.2-A.4), we then ﬁnd that

the ﬂuctuations in the thermodynamic energy density to be (see, Sommerfeld 1950 for an

alternative interpretation)

δεi = δp,

(A.5)

26

so that, neglecting the integration constant, we ultimately obtain equation (6, Section 2.2)

of the main text, ie.,

ε (r, t) = p (r, t) +

B2 (r, t)
8π

ρ0
2

+

u2 (r, t)

(A.6)

for an incompressible ﬂuid.

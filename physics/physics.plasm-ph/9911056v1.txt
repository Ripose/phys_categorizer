Abstract

Physical processes ranging from the Lamb shift to the energy loss dE/dx of
a charged particle traversing a plasma entail two diﬀerent mechanisms that
are important at two diﬀerent energy or length scales. Here we examine the
energy loss example because its analysis is simple. On one hand, it involves
soft collisions that are screened by collective eﬀects at large distances while,
on the other hand, there are hard, short-distance collisions where the exact
details of the single-particle interactions must be taken into account. We
introduce a novel technique of dimensional continuation in which the soft
processes are computed for dimensions ν < 3, the hard processes for ν > 3,
and we explain why their sum yields the correct result for the physical limit
at ν = 3 dimensions.

The usual method for obtaining the energy loss for a charged particle moving through
matter is to divide the calculation into two parts: The long-distance, soft collisions and the
short-distance, hard collisions. Collective eﬀects are important in the long-distance part,
and it is evaluated from the j · E power loss of a particle moving in a dielectric medium. The
hard collisions are described by Coulomb scattering. The rub is to join the disparate pieces
together. For the case of classical scattering, this is often done by computing the energy loss
in Coulomb scattering out to some impact parameter, and then adding the j · E energy loss
for all larger impact parameters. Although such methods do yield the correct large logarithm
without much diﬃculty, the logarithm of the ratio of the two scales which is large, the purely
numerical constants (which one expects to be of order one) that accompany the logarithm
are harder to compute. Here we describe an easily applied method that yields a unique
result – the result including the constants in addition to the large logarithm. The new idea
is to compute the energy loss from Coulomb scattering over all angles, but for dimensions
ν > 3 where there are no infrared divergences. A separate calculation of the energy loss
using the j · E heating is done for ν < 3, where the volume integration may be extended
down to the particle’s position without encountering an ultraviolet divergence. Both of these
results have a simple pole at ν = 3, but they both may be analytically continued beyond
their initial range of validity. In their original domain of dimension ν, both calculations are
performed to the leading order in the plasma density. As will be seen, although the Coulomb
scattering result is the leading order contribution for ν > 3, it is of subleading order when
ν < 3. Conversely, the j · E heating is subleading for ν > 3 but leading for ν < 3. Hence, the
sum of the two (analytically continued) processes gives the leading and (ﬁrst) subleading
terms in the plasma density for all dimensions ν, and thus, in the limit of this sum at ν = 3,
the pole terms must cancel with the remainder yielding the correct physical limit to leading
order in the plasma density.

It should be emphasized that we are making use of a new and novel application of
continuation to dimensions ν 6= 3 to compute results that are well-deﬁned and ﬁnite at the
physical ν = 3 dimension. We are not using dimensional continuation to render inﬁnities
ﬁnite so as to perform renormalizations as one does in quantum ﬁeld theory. Moreover, our
purpose is to introduce and describe this new application of dimensional continuation; the
energy loss problem is used only as a convenient vehicle for illustrating the new idea.

Since the reasoning here may appear to be subtle,

it is worth illustrating it with
a trivial mathematical example, the behavior of the modiﬁed Hankel function Kν(z) in
the small argument z limit with the index ν also small. For ν > 0, the leading term
is Kν(z)=(z/2)−ν(1−νγ)/2ν, while for ν < 0 it is Kν(z) = −(z/2)ν(1 + νγ)/2ν, where
γ = 0.5772 · · · is Euler’s constant. For ν > 0 one term is leading and the other subleading,
while for ν < 0 their roles are interchanged. Thus their sum

contains both the leading and subleading terms for both ν > 0 and ν < 0. The limit ν → 0
of this sum yields the correct small z result K0(z) = − ln(z/2) −γ . It is must be emphasized
that the correct constant terms [ln 2 − γ] are obtained by this method in addition to the
logarithm − ln z which is large for small z.

Since we are only interested in describing the new method, we simplify the discussion by
treating only the electrons in a classical plasma (electron recoil gives the dominant energy

2

loss since they are light), and by taking the moving projectile velocity vp to be much larger
than the electron velocities in the plasma so that the latter may be neglected relative to
vp. We shall assume, however, that the projectile velocity is small in comparison with the
velocity of light so that this particle produces a simple Coulomb ﬁeld (as modiﬁed by the
plasma) and that nonrelativistic mechanics applies.

We ﬁrst compute the j · E heating with ν < 3. Since the current j is that of a particle of
charge ep and velocity vp at the point r = vpt, this energy loss mechanism gives dE/dt =
−epvp · E(vpt, t) , with E(r, t) the electric ﬁeld produced by the moving particle. Solving
the ﬁeld equation by Fourier transform, it is easy to ﬁnd that

where ﬁnal −1 in the square brackets produces a term in the integrand that is odd in k and
thus makes no contribution to the complete integral. It is included so as to to make the
convergence of the integral at large wave number manifest so long as ν < 3. The function
ǫ(ω, k) is the frequency and wave-number dependent dielectric function of the plasma. The
nature of this function is illustrated by the ﬁrst approximation [1] (which is the classical
limit of the ring sum of quantum statistical mechanics)

where the ǫ → 0+ in the denominator corresponds to a retarded response. With ω = k · vp
and, by our simplifying assumption, vp ≫ v, we see that the ω term in the denominator
dominates so that ǫ(ω, k) may be replaced by ǫ(ω, 0). This limit of Eq.(3) is obtained by
expanding the denominator to ﬁrst order in k · v and integrating ∂/∂v by parts to secure

It should be noted that this result has a greater range of validity than its derivation would
indicate; namely, under our assumptions that the wave number be small and the frequency
be large, the dielectric function generally assumes this asymptotic form. Using it in Eq.(2),
performing the integration over the component of k parallel to vp by a contour integration
closed by a large semi-circle in the upper-half plane, and writing dx = vpdt gives

The pole in this expression, which becomes negative when ν > 3, corresponds to the ultra-
violet divergence which appear when ν → 3.

We turn now to the ν > 3 case where the energy loss is computed by single-particle
scattering. By the conservation of energy, the energy loss in the scattering of the projectile
p on electrons whose initial velocity may be neglected is ∆E = −(mp/2)[v′
velocity vp → v′
2−
p] = (me/2)v′
2. Since the initial electron has no momentum, this can be written in the
v2
invariant form ∆E = q2/(2me), where q is the electron momentum transfer in the scattering
process. With the initial electron at rest, the diﬀerential rate of scattering is vpnedσ, where
ne is the electron density in the plasma and dσ is the cross section element. Since dx = vpdt,
the energy loss for ν > 3 is given by

We ﬁrst evaluate this scattering contribution when the interaction is weak, when η =

The pole in this expression, which become negative when ν < 3, corresponds to an infrared
divergence in the ν → 3 limit.

When this result is added to that in Eq. (9) the divergent pole terms cancel, and the

As indicated before, this is the correct result to leading order in the plasma density. Instead
of using the plasma density for the proof, it is equivalent to use the linearly related plasma
frequency ωe. We have computed the leading and subleading terms in this quantity. The
result (9) for dE</dx involves ω2
while the result (14) for dE>/dx involves just
ω2
e . Hence, for ν < 3, (9) is leading and (14) is subleading, while for ν > 3, their roles are
reversed. Thus, in either region the sum of the two contributions contains both the leading
and (ﬁrst) subleading terms, and so the limit of the sum at the physical dimension ν = 3
yields the correct result to leading order in the plasma density.

The result (15), including the proper constants inside the logarithm, may be essentially
obtained by applying the j · E heating formula (2) directly in three dimensions with the use
of the single-ring graph quantum form of the dielectric function in the limit in which the
electrons in the plasma are taken to have negligible velocity. Using this function [2],

ǫ(ω, k) = 1 −

ω2
e
(ω + iǫ)2 − (¯hk2/2me)2 ,

(16)

in Eq. (2), a straight forward calculation gives the result (15) as the leading term for small
ωe, except that the correct reduced mass m in Eq. (15) is replaced by the electron mass
me since the current j describes the motion of a very heavy projectile particle. This sort of
calculation was done some time ago by Lindhard [3], but it is restricted to a cold plasma
whose electron velocities are much less than that of the projectile. On the other hand, our
method is easily extended [4] to treat the case of a hot plasma where this restriction is not
imposed, and again a complete calculation can be performed which includes the constants
in addition to the logarithm.

Our method can be used to extend the result (15) to arbitrary values of η = eep/(¯hvp),
always retaining the correct additional constants. To do this, we use some clever mathemat-
ics of Lindhard and Sorensen [5], but in a manner which justiﬁes that these constants have
been kept. Namely, we compute

(17)

This diﬀerence is well behaved in the limit ν → 3 since the pole at ν = 3 produced by the
cross section integral comes from soft, infrared physics which is completely contained in the

5

Born approximation dσB. Although we always have in mind this diﬀerence, for simplicity
of exposition we shall omit the subtraction of the Born term in an intermediate step: The
partial wave decomposition of the scattering amplitude and standard manipulations yield

This result, including the proper constant 2e−γ that appears within the logarithm, was
obtained long ago by Kramers [7]. It may also be obtained directly [8] with our dimensional
continuation methods by using the classical Coulomb scattering cross section for dimension
ν > 3 in the scattering energy loss expression (10).

Essentially the method introduced in this letter has been used before [9] to calculate
the Lamb shift, with the role of the plasma density replaced by the nuclear charge. That
exposition, however, was presented in a somewhat mystical manner, and it unfortunately
did not bring out the essence of the method. The method introduced in this letter has also
recently been applied to compute the electrical conductivity of a classical plasma [10].

Kinetic ﬂuctuation in the inhomogeneous plasma

Abstract

Using the Langevin approach and the multiscale technique, a kinetic
theory of the time and space nonlocal ﬂuctuations in the collisional plasma
is constructed. In local equilibrium a generalized version of the Callen-
Welton theorem is derived.
It is shown that not only the dissipation
but also the time and space derivatives of the dispersion determine the
amplitude and the width of the spectrum lines of the electrostatic ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations, as well as the form factor. There appear signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences with respect to the non-uniform plasma. In the kinetic regime the
form factor is more sensible to space gradient than the spectral function
of the electrostatic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. As a result of the inhomogeneity,
these proprieties became asymmetric with respect to the inversion of the
frequency sign. The diﬀerences in amplitude of peaks could become a new
tool to diagnose slow time and space variations in the plasma.

Keywords: Kinetic Theory; Plasma Fluctuations; Non-local Processes

Fluctuations ﬁnd an application in diagnostic procedures. Indeed,
plasma parameters such as temperature, mean velocity, density and
their respective proﬁles can be determined by incoherent (Thom-
son) scattering diagnostics [1], i.e. by the proper interpretation of
data obtained from the scattering of a given electromagnetic ﬁeld
interacting with the system. The key point of interpretating them
is the knowledge of the intensity of the dielectric function ﬂuctu-
ations or equally of the electron form factor (δneδne)ω,k. Here ω
and k are respectively the frequency and wavevector of the autocor-
relations. Due to the Poisson equation the electron form factor in
the spatially homogeneous system is directly linked to the electro-
static ﬁeld ﬂuctuations, which have been the object of active study
since the early 1960s [1].
In the thermodynamic equilibrium, the
electrostatic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations satisfy the famous Callen-Welton
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem [2]:

(δEδE)ωk = Θ

linking their intensity to the imaginary part of the dielectric function ε(ω, k),
and the temperature Θ in energy units. The spectral function (1) has peaks,
corresponding to proper plasma frequencies. The matter becomes more tricky in
the non-equilibrium case, when the state of the plasma is given by Maxwellian
distributions characterized by diﬀerent constant temperatures and velocities
per species (Θa, Va; a = e, i). We have indeed shown [3], that, in the collisional
regime equations (1) should be revisited. We stressed the fact that a kinetic
approach should be taken. Introducing ﬂuctuations by the Langevin method,
we have elaborated a ”revisited” Callen-Welton formula containing, beside the
terms appearing in Eq.
(1), new terms explicitly displaying dissipative non
equilibrium contributions.

(δEδE)ωk =

Xa,b=e,i

(ω − k · Va) |ε(ω, k)|2 [Imχa+νab(Θa−Θb)Φ1+νab(k · Va−k · Vb)Φ2],

8πΘa

(2)
where χa (a = e, i) is the complex dielectric susceptibility of the a-th component
It is important that these new terms contain the interparticle collision frequency
νab, the diﬀerences in temperatures (Θa − Θb) and velocities (Va − Vb), and
the functions Φ1 and Φ2 of real parts of the dielectric susceptibilities.
It is
however not evident that the plasma parameters - temperature, velocities and
densities can be kept constant .
Inhomogeneities in space and time of these
quantities will certainly also contribute to the ﬂuctuations. Obviously, to treat
the problem, a kinetic approach is required , especially when the wavelength
of the ﬂuctuations is larger than the Debye wavelength. To derive nonlocal
expressions for the spectral function of the electrostatic ﬁeld ﬂuctuation and
for the electron form factor we use the Langevin approach to describe kinetic
ﬂuctuations [4, 5]. The starting point of our procedure is the same as in [3]. A
kinetic equation for the ﬂuctuation δfa of the one-particle distribution function
(DF) with respect to the reference state fa is considered. In the general case the
reference state is a none-equilibrium DF which varies in space and time both
−1)
on the kinetic scale ( mean free path lei and interparticle collision time νei
and on the larger hydrodynamic scales. These scales are much larger than
the characteristic ﬂuctuation time ω−1.
In the non-equilibrium case we can
therefore introduce a small parameter µ = νei/ω, which allows us to describe
ﬂuctuations on the basis of a multiple space and time scale analysis. Obviously,
the ﬂuctuations vary on both the ”fast” (r, t) and the ”slow” (µr, µt) time and
space scales: δfa(x,t) = δfa(x, t, µt, µr) and fa(x,t) = fa(p, µt, µr). Here x
stands for the phase-space coordinates (r, p). The Langevin kinetic equation
for δfa has the form [4, 3]

Laxt is determined by

δfa(x,t)δfb(x′,t′)
For the stationary and spatially uniform systems, when DF fa and the op-
Γa do not depend on time and space, Gab(x,t, x′,t′) can depend only on
erator
its time and space variables through the diﬀerence t − t′ and r − r′.
In the

general case, when the one-particle DF fa(p,µr,µt) and the operator
Γa slowly
(in comparison with the correlation scales) vary in time and space, and when
non-local eﬀects are considered, the time and space dependence of Gab(x,t, x′,t′)
is more subtle.

For the homogeneous case this non-trivial result was obtained for the ﬁrst

expanding the Green function in Eq. (9) in terms of the small parameter µ,
there appear additional terms at ﬁrst order. It is important to note that the
imaginary part of the dielectric susceptibility is now replaced by the real part,
which is greater than imaginary part by the factor µ−1. Therefore, the second
and third terms in Eq. (16) in the kinetic regime have an eﬀect comparable to
that of the ﬁrst term. At second order in the expansion in µ the corrections
appear only in the imaginary part of the susceptibility, and they can reasonably
be neglected. It is therefore suﬃcient to retain the ﬁrst order corrections to solve
the problem.

is the eﬀective damping decrement. For the case where the system parameters
are homogeneous in space but vary in time, the correction is still symmetric
with respect to the change of sign of ω, but the intensities and broadening are
diﬀerent, and the intensity integrated over the frequencies remains the same as in
the stationary case. However, when the plasma parameters are space dependent
this symmetry is lost. The spectral asymmetry is related to the appearance of
space anisotropy in inhomogeneous systems. The real part of the susceptibility
Reε is an even function of ω. This property implies that the contribution of the
third term to the expression of the damping decrement (19) is an odd function
of ω. Moreover this term gives rise to an anisotropy in k space.

of calculation, let us note that the damping decrements for the electrostatic
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations [Eq. (19)] and for the electron density ﬂuctuations [Eq. (23)]
are not the same. The origin of this diﬀerence is that the Green function for
electrostatic ﬁeld ﬂuctuation and density particle ﬂuctuations are not the same.

inhomogeneity; i.e., the same gradient of the density, we plot the form fac-
tor (δneδne)ω,k together with the (δEδE)ω,k as functions of frequency (Fig.
1). This ﬁgure shows that the asymmetry of the spectral lines is present both
for (δneδne)ω,k and (δEδE)ω,k. However, this eﬀect is more pronounced in
(δneδne)ω,k than in (δEδE)ω,k.

Conclusion 1 We have shown that the amplitude and the width of the spectral
lines of the electrostatic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations and form factor are aﬀected by new
non-local dispersive terms. They are not related to Joule dissipation and appear
because of an additional phase shift between the vectors of induction and electric
ﬁeld. This phase shift results from the ﬁnite time needed to set the polarization
in the plasma with dispersion. Such a phase shift in the plasma with space dis-
persion appears due to the medium inhomogeneity. These results are important

7

for the understanding and the classiﬁcation of the various phenomena that may
be observed in applications; in particular, the asymmetry of lines can be used as
a diagnostic tool to measure local gradients in the plasma.

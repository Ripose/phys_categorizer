TRAPPING, COMPRESSION AND ACCELERATION OF AN ELECTRON BUNCH

IN THE NONLINEAR LASER WAKEFIELD

Yerevan Physics Institute, Alikhanian Brothers Street 2,

Yerevan 375036, Armenia

A scheme of laser wakeﬁeld acceleration, when a relatively rare and long bunch of non-relativistic

or weakly-relativistic electrons is initially in front of the laser pulse, is suggested and considered. The

motion of test electrons is studied both in the one-dimensional case (1D wakeﬁeld) and in the three-

dimensional laser wakeﬁeld excited in a plasma channel. It is shown that the bunch is trapped, eﬀectively

compressed both in longitudinal and transverse directions and accelerated to ultra-relativistic energies

in the region of ﬁrst accelerating maximum of the wakeﬁeld. The accelerated bunch has sizes much less

than the plasma wavelength and relatively small energy spread.

I. INTRODUCTION

The rapid progress in the technology of high-intensity lasers, based on the chirped-pulse ampliﬁcation

(CPA) [1], opens new opportunities for the use of lasers in many branches of science and industry.
Relatively inexpensive tabletop terawatt lasers (so-called T3-lasers) become a qualitatively new tool

in physical researches and now are available at many laboratories over the world. Last years CPA

technique permitted the production of subpicosecond laser pulses of multiterawatt power with peak
intensities exceeding 1020W/cm2 [2]. With intensities as such we practically have to do with a new

interaction range of laser radiation with matter, where the role of the nonlinear eﬀects is often essential.

In this intense laser ﬁeld the matter is usually transformed to plasma and free electrons oscillate with

relativistic quivering energy. Presently, the interactions of high-power laser radiation with plasma are

actively investigated in connection with diﬀerent applications: the excitation of strong plasma wake waves

for focusing and acceleration of charged bunches [3]; generation of radiation at harmonics of carrier laser

frequency [4]; X-ray sources [5]; laser inertial fusion [6] etc.

The laser wakeﬁeld, generated in plasma by the short (with the length ≈ λp/2, where λp is the plasma

wavelength) intense laser pulse provides the acceleration gradient up to tens GeV/m (laser wakeﬁeld

acceleration, LWFA [7,8]), that is three orders of magnitude higher than that achieved in conventional

accelerators. The main aim of experimental and theoretical works, that are presently in progress, is the

construction of compact and relatively inexpensive accelerators of charged particles for applications in

1

physics research, medicine and hi-tech industry. However, some challenges remain on this way, one of

the main of those is the problem of electron bunch injection.

The wake wavelength in the LWFA is λp ≈ 2cτL [3] (here τL is the laser pulse duration) and makes
up tens or hundreds micrometers for typical plasma densities np ∼ 1016 − 1019 cm−3. To obtain high

quality relativistic electron bunch accelerated by the wake wave, it is necessary to inject short (with the

length L ≪ λp), enough dense relativistic electron bunch in the accelerating phase of the wake wave

with femtosecond synchronization, that is diﬃcult technical problem (see e.g. Ref.

[9]). The injection

schemes proposed for the standard LWFA (the LIPA [9], the colliding laser pulses [10] and the LILAC

[11] schemes) are aimed at the generation of such a short relativistic bunch.

The diﬀraction broadening leads to rapid decrease of the intense laser pulse amplitude with the

characteristic length ZR = πr2

0/λL (here ZR is the Rayleigh length, r0 is the focal spot size of the

pulse, and λL is the laser wavelength) that is typically in order of a millimeter. To prevent diﬀraction

the plasma channel, with minimum density at the axis, proposed to guide the laser pulse in the LWFA

[12]. The amplitude of the accelerating component of the wake wave, generated in the plasma channel,

decreases as the distance from the laser pulse increases [13,14]. Besides, the change of the plasma

wavelength λp in the transverse direction [λp ∼ n

(r), where np is the density of electrons in the

−1/2
p

plasma channel], leads to undesirable wave front curving; this eﬀect becomes stronger as the distance

from the pulse increases. The eﬀect of the wave front curving in the channel, in the case of a strong laser

pulse (a0 = eEm/mecωL ≥ 1, where e and me are the absolute charge and mass of the electron, Em is

the maximum amplitude of laser ﬁeld, c is the speed of light in vacuum, and ωL is the laser frequency) is

ampliﬁed due to the nonlinear change of the wake wavelength in transverse direction [15,16]. Thus, for

regular acceleration of a charged bunch in the wake wave, the most preferable is the region of the ﬁrst

maximum of accelerating ﬁeld behind the laser pulse.

To avoid the aforesaid diﬃculties in LWFA, we suggest and study in this work a scheme of trapping,

compression and acceleration of a non-relativistic or weakly-relativistic electron bunch in the laser wake-

ﬁeld, when the bunch is initially in front of the laser pulse. The initial bunch density can be much less

than that required for the accelerating bunch and the bunch sizes - in order or more than the plasma

wavelength, i.e. much more than require other methods of injection [9-11]. Our investigations take into

account both the pulse ponderomotive force and the wakeﬁeld. It is shown that the bunch is trapped,

eﬀectively compressed both in longitudinal and transverse directions and accelerated to ultra-relativistic

energies in the region of ﬁrst accelerating maximum of the wakeﬁeld. The accelerated bunch has sizes

much less than the plasma wavelength and enough good quality.

II. THE CASE OF WIDE LASER PULSE

At ﬁrst we neglect the transverse variation of the laser pulse amplitude and consider the case of

2

one-dimensional laser wakeﬁeld excited by a wide bunch in uniform plasma. This allows to study the

longitudinal dynamics of the bunch electrons in more details.

A. Basic equations and correlations

One-dimensional steady wakeﬁeld excited by the linearly-polarized laser pulses are described by the

following equation (see, e.g. Ref. [3])

where Φ = 1 + eϕ/mec2 is the dimensionless potential of the plasma wakeﬁeld, a = eE0(ξ)/mecωL, E0
is the electric ﬁeld amplitude of the laser pulse, ξ = kp(z − vgt), kp = ωp/vg, ωp = (4πnpe2/me)1/2 is the

plasma frequency, vg is the group velocity of the laser pulse which is equal to the phase velocity of the
g )−1/2 is the relativistic factor, which, in the case γg >> 1, is nearly
wake wave, βg = vg/c, γg = (1 − β2
equal to ωL/ωp. The electric ﬁeld of exited wakeﬁeld, normalized to the non-relativistic wave-breaking
ﬁeld EW B = mevgωp/e, can be obtained from equation Ez = −(1/βg)2dΦ/dξ. The equation of motion

of the test electron in the wakeﬁeld and in the ﬁeld of laser pulse is (see e.g. Ref. [17]):

Here the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the relativistic ponderomotive force averaged over the fast

laser oscillations, and the second one corresponds to the plasma wakeﬁeld excited by the laser pulse,
β = v/c, p = βγ and γ = (1 + p2 + a2/2)1/2 = [(1 + a2/2)/(1 − β2)]1/2 are the normalized longitudinal

velocity and momentum and the relativistic factor of the test electron (transverse velocity is zero in this

Section), τ = ωpt. Multiplying Eq. (2) by β, after some simple transformations, one can obtain the

following integral of motion (see also Refs. [14,18])

γ − βgp − Φ = const.

Let us consider an electron that is initially ahead of the laser pulse at some point ξ0 where Φ = 1 and

a = 0. If the electron has initial momentum p0 < βgγg, it will be overtaken by the laser pulse and can

be trapped at some point ξr inside the pulse or in the wake and accelerated. At the trapping point (or,

in other words, at the point of reﬂection) the velocity of the electron become equal to vg. Then from

expression (3) we have:

S ≡ (1 + a

In Eq. (4) ar and Φr are the amplitude of the laser pulse and the wakeﬁeld potential at the reﬂection

point ξr. From Eq. (4) it follows

The minus sign in (5) corresponds to the initial momentum p0 of an electron which has momentum βgγg

at the point ξr and the plus sign corresponds to the momentum of free electron which initially was at

the point ξr. Expression (5) describes both trapped and passing particles. In the wake, electrons can be

trapped only in the region where Ez ≤ 0. Equation of motion (2) can be rewritten in the form

In Fig. 1 a laser pulse with a0 = 2 and nonlinear wakeﬁeld excited by it are presented (here and below

in numerical calculations σz = 2, ξc = 3 and γg = 10). The amplitude of the wake wave is essentially
less than one-dimensional relativistic wave-breaking ﬁeld Erel = [2(1 − γg)]1/2/βg ≈ 4.26 [3,19]. Figure 2

shows the dependence of initial electron momentum p0 on the trapping point near the ﬁrst accelerating

maximum in the wake wave. The minimum value of the initial momentum pmin corresponds to the

trapping point where the potential is at the minimum and Ez = 0. Curves 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 reach

their minimums at diﬀerent points, that is the consequence of the nonlinear increase of wake wavelength

with the amplitude (this dependence can be found in Ref. [20]). The curves were obtained numerically

and coincide with the expression (5) for the trapped particles. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the

value of pmin and wake wave amplitude Ez,max on a0. One can see that a laser pulse with a0 ∼ 1 (that
corresponds to the peak intensity of the pulse Imax ∼ 1018W/cm2 for λL = 1µm, and Imax ∼ 1016W/cm2

when λL = 10µm) provides trapping of initially non-relativistic or weakly-relativistic electrons in the

wake wave. For example, pmin ≈ 0.4 for the wakeﬁeld presented in Fig. 1. Electrons with p0 < pmin

can not be trapped in the wake wave and may be detected behind the wave. This circumstance can

help to determine the wake wave amplitude in experiments. Our numerical calculations have witnessed

that electrons with p0 < βgγg can not be trapped in the region occupied by the laser pulse because of

the decelerating wakeﬁeld; only electrons with p0 ≈ βgγg are trapped in the head of the pulse (where

Ez ≈ 0) due to the ponderomotive force. This conﬁrms with the results of Ref. [18].

Figure 4 shows the behavior of electrons of mono-energetic non-relativistic (p0 = 0.5, γ0 = (1 +
0)1/2 ≈ 1.12) bunch in the wakeﬁeld presented in Fig. 1. Initial dimensionless bunch length is L0 = 5,
p2

4

that roughly corresponds to the linear plasma wavelength λp. When τ = 50, the trapped bunch length

is L ≈ 0.027 and L ≈ 0.04 when τ = 100, that is two orders of magnitude less than the initial bunch

length. The absolute energy spread ∆γ in the accelerating bunch increases insigniﬁcantly with time, but

the relative energy spread ε = ∆γ/γ falls due to growing γ; for example ε ≈ 0.26 at τ = 50, and ε ≈ 0.14

when τ = 100. The acceleration gradient in the considering case is approximately equal to 2M eV /λp.
For example, when λp = 100µm (np ≈ 1017cm−3), the acceleration gradient is 20GeV /m.

Figure 5 shows the motion of electrons with diﬀerent initial momentums and the same initial positions

(0.6 ≤ p0 ≤ 1.2, 1.17 ≤ γ ≤ 1.56, ξ0 = 0) in the wakeﬁeld presented in Fig. 1. The trapped bunch length

is nearly 27 times less than the plasma wavelength λp. The relative energy spread at τ = 100 is about

0.1, that is much less than that of initial electrons.

The dephasing length, for electrons with pmin ≤ p0 ≤ 1.2, varies in the range 630 ≤ Ld ≤ 700 (the

grater values correspond to the smaller initial momentums) that is comparable with the linear dephasing
length λpγ2

g [3], which, in our notations, corresponds to Ld = 2πγ2

g = 200π. The maximum relativistic

factor of accelerated particles is in the range 350 ≤ γmax ≤ 410 (here again the greater values correspond
to smaller p0) that essentially exceeds the linear value 2γ2
than the maximum nonlinear value 4γ3

g = 200 [3], but is an order of magnitude less

g = 4000 [20,21].

C. Energy spread in the accelerating bunch

Energy spread in the trapped bunch depends on energy spread and length of the initial bunch. The

tail electrons of initial bunch are trapped earlier and therefore, have greater energy during acceleration

(see Fig. 4). Slower particles also are trapped earlier (see Fig. 5). Let us suppose that initially the

bunch is at the head of laser pulse, so that ξ = 0 corresponds to the bunch tail, and τtr(p0) is the

time necessary to trap an electron which is initially at ξ = 0; the initial electron momentum is in the

range p1 ≤ p0 ≤ p2. Then, for energy spread in the trapped bunch we can write ∆γ ∼ ∆τtrEz,max =

[τtr(p2) − τtr(p1) + L0/(1 − v2/vg)]Ez,max, where ∆τtr is the time interval which is necessary to trap the

initial bunch. For the relative energy spread one has: ε ∼ ∆τtr/(τ − ∆τtr). These estimates agree well

with the numerical results. One can see that the presence of fast electrons (with v0 ∼ vg ≈ c) in the

initial bunch leads to an undesirable increase in the energy spread.

The trapped bunch density can be found from expression nb(τ ) ≈ nb0L0/L(τ ), where nb0 is the initial

bunch density.

D. Wakeﬁeld generated by the accelerating bunch

The trapped bunch also generates wakeﬁeld which can destroy the laser wakeﬁeld and decrease the

accelerating ﬁeld. Because the accelerating bunch is short (L(τ ) ≪ λp) we can consider it as a plane

bunch and ﬁnd the normalized amplitude of the wakeﬁeld excited by the bunch from expression Eb,max =

5

kp(vb/c)(Nb/np) [22], where vb and Nb are velocity and the surface density of the bunch correspondingly.

This expression is valid both in linear and non-linear regimes. In our case Nb = δnb0L0/kp, where δ ≤ 1

is the ratio of number of trapped electrons to the total number of particles in the initial bunch, and we

have:

Eb,max = δ(vb/c)(nb0L0/np).

(7)

The normalized amplitude of moderately nonlinear laser wake wave, considering in this paper, is about

unit. So, we can neglect the wakeﬁeld generated by the bunch if Eb,max ≪ 1, or when

nb0 ≪ np(c/vb)(1/δL0).

For np ∼ 1016 − 1018cm−3 (that is typical for the LWFA experiments [3]), vb ≈ c, δ ≈ 1 and the initial
bunch length in order of λp (L0 ∼ 5 − 10) this condition reads nb0 < 1014 − 1016cm−3. The density of

accelerating bunch may be in order of plasma density.

Thus, the one-dimensional analysis has showed the possibility of trapping, essential compression and

high-gradient acceleration of a low energy electron bunch in moderately nonlinear laser wakeﬁeld.

III. TRAPPING, COMPRESSION AND ACCELERATION IN THE LASER

WAKEFIELD EXCITED IN PLASMA CHANNEL

In this section we consider our scheme of LWFA for the case of laser wakeﬁeld excited in a plasma

channel and study the peculiarities of radial motion of test electrons during trapping and acceleration.

A. Nonlinear laser wakeﬁeld excited in plasma channel

As was mentioned in Introduction, the plasma channel is necessary to guide a laser pulse. This

allows to essentially increase the laser-plasma interaction distance [12], that, in its turn, provides ultra-

relativistic acceleration in the wakeﬁeld [3]. Nonlinear axially-symmetrical laser wakeﬁelds excited in a

plasma channel are described by the following system of equations [15]:

σr = rch and np(rch) − np(0) = 1/πrer2
radius and all values are dimensional [12]. Then, in expression (10), ∆ = (2/σrβg)2.

Equations (8.1)-(8.6) were solved numerically for the following parameters of the problem: a0 = 2,

σz = 2, σr = 5 and γg = 10. In this case ∆ ≈ 0.16, the value of b was chosen to be 0.01. In Fig. 7 we

present the radial proﬁle of unperturbed plasma density and the radial behavior of laser pulse intensity,
namely exp(−2r2/σ2

r ). Fig. 8 shows the longitudinal electric ﬁeld and the focusing ﬁeld fr = βHθ − Er

of the wakeﬁeld excited. One can see that the wake wavelength decreases as r increases. This is caused

by the radial increase of unperturbed plasma density in the channel [3,13] and by the nonlinear increase

of wavelength with the wake wave amplitude which is at maximum on the axis [15,16,24]. Fig. 7 shows

also the nonlinear steepening of the accelerating ﬁeld like that takes place in one-dimensional wakeﬁeld

(see Fig. 1). Due to the dependence of the wavelength on r, the ﬁeld in the radial direction grows more

7

chaotic as the distance from the laser pulse increases. In fact, the oscillations of the plasma for diﬀerent

r are started behind the pulse with nearly equal phases but diﬀerent wavelengths. As |ξ| increases, the

change of phase in the transverse direction becomes more and more marked. This leads to a curving of

the phase front and to oscillations in the transverse direction [15,16,24]. Such behavior of the wakeﬁeld

excited in a plasma channel leads to the transverse multistream motion of plasma electrons in the wake

and to the transverse wave-breaking [25]. The radial dependence of longitudinal electric ﬁeld and the

focusing force is shown in Fig. 8 for point ξ = −10.9 at which the on-axis accelerating ﬁeld reaches

its maximum. We see that the wakeﬁeld changes its sign and is steepened. For the ultra-relativistic

acceleration of electrons one needs to use a region in the wakeﬁeld where the conditions Ez < 0 and

fr < 0 are satisﬁed simultaneously. The radial steepening leads to the radial restriction or the region

suitable for acceleration. Near the ﬁrst accelerating maximum of the wakeﬁeld shown in Fig. 7, the

suitable region is r < 2.8. As the distance from the laser pulse increases, the suitable region becomes

narrower, so that at some distance the wakeﬁeld is highly irregular. Thus, the most preferable for electron

acceleration is the region of the ﬁrst accelerating maximum in the wake.

Here all values are dimensionless, β = v/c = p/γ is the normalized velocity, γ = (1 + p2 + a2/2)1/2 =
[(1 + a2/2)/(1 − β2)]1/2 is the relativistic factor. For the momentum components, from Eq. (11) one

has:

It follows from Eq. (12.2) that the azimuthal momentum is conserved, pθ = const, βθ(τ ) = pθ(0)/γ(τ ).

The azimuthal momentum has not essential inﬂuence on the axial and radial dynamics, and we suppose

pθ(0) = 0 in this paper. For the energy of electrons Eq. (11) gives the following equation:

From Eqs. (12.4), (13) and (9) we obtain the integral of motion

γ − βgpz − Φ(ξ, r) = const,

(14)

which formally coincides with the one-dimensional integral of motion (3) [14,26,27]. Electrons can be

trapped in the region where wakeﬁeld is both accelerating and focusing. For the scattered particles, from
Eq. (14) one has p2
z − 1, here S = [1 + p2(0)]1/2 − βgpz(0). If an electron is initially
non-relativistic (|p(0)| ≪ 1, S ≈ 1), then pr ≈ (2pz)1/2 and tan θ = pr/pz ≈ [2/(γ − 1)]1/2, where θ is

r = (S + βgpz)2 − p2

the angle between z-axis and ﬁnal momentum of the scattered electron [28].

The normalized components of velocity obey the formulae βz = βg(1 + dξ/dτ ) and βr = βgdr/dτ . For
particles trapped in the wakeﬁeld, we suppose that during acceleration βz ≈ 1, β2

r ≪ 1 and r < 1 (the

numerical results presented below show that this is the case). Then, from Eq. (15.1) one has

d2ξ/dτ 2 ≈ Ez/γ3.

(16)

It follows from this equation that dγ/dτ ≈ −Ez and γ ≈ −

Ezdτ . Thus, the longitudinal dynamics of

accelerating particles is approximately the same as in the one-dimensional case. The radial motion of

electrons, according to Eq. (15.2), obeys the equation

C. Results of test-particle simulations and discussion

Motion of test electrons in the 2D wakeﬁeld presented in Fig. 7 was investigated by numerical solution

of Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) for diﬀerent initial positions and momentums. Figure 9 shows the behavior

of electrons with zero initial transverse momentums and with diﬀerent initial radial positions. One can

9

see that particles are trapped near the ﬁrst accelerating maximum in the wake. During the trapping,

electrons concentrate near the axis due to the focusing force βzHθ − Er. Sins the longitudinal size of

the trapped bunch is much less than the plasma wavelength and its transverse size is essentially less

than that of the laser pulse, the electrons experience approximately the same accelerating ﬁeld; the

longitudinal dynamics is well described by the one-dimensional theory. The focusing force acting on

the bunch electrons depends on r linearly (see Fig. 8). The small bunch sizes (as compared with the

wakeﬁeld characteristic sizes) and the fact that electrons are trapped near the accelerating maximum

provide high accelerating gradient and relatively small energy spread. For example, the relative energy

spread of electrons presented in Fig. 9 is 5% at τ = 300. The numerical results show that dynamics of

the accelerating bunch is well described by approximate equations (16)-(18). The betatron oscillations

of the accelerating electrons are clearly seen in Fig. 9(b). The wavelength of this oscillations decreases

with the increase of particle’s energy that conform to the formula for betatron frequency. Radial velocity

of accelerating electrons is much less than the longitudinal one, |βr(τ )| < 0.1. One can see also that

even electrons which are initially at the periphery [r(τ = 0) ≡ r0 ∼ σr] can be trapped in the wakeﬁeld

and accelerated. The characteristic dependence of the minimum trapping threshold pz,min on the initial

radial position of an electron is presented in Fig. 10. Figure 11 shows the minimum and maximum initial

radial momentums of trapped electrons in dependence on initial radial position. The ﬁgure witnesses

that electrons which initially move at relatively high angle to the axis (up to tens degrees) also can

be trapped and accelerated. This again is caused by the focusing force and the fact that electrons are

initially non-relativistic (γ0 ∼ 1).

In Fig. 12 we show behavior of electrons of a bunch with the following initial parameters: 0 ≤ ξ0 ≤ 5,

r0 ≤ 4, 0.6 ≤ pz0 ≤ 0.8, −0.02 ≤ pr0 ≤ 0.02. The passing particles (not showed) are well separated from

accelerating one both spatially and energetically. The length of accelerating bunch in this case also is

much less than the plasma wavelength [L(τ = 100) ≈ 0.27, L(τ = 300) ≈ 0.19]. The radius of the bunch

R decreases relatively slowly during acceleration and is essentially less than the characteristic transverse

size of the wakeﬁeld σr, R(τ ) ∼ 1; the bunch radius can be reduced by the choice of smaller laser spot

size. The absolute energy spread does not change practically, ∆γ ≈ 24, but the relative energy spread

falls and is equal to about 10% at τ = 300. The estimations of absolute and relative energy spreads

presented in Sec. II are valid also in 3D case.

Total number of electrons trapped and their density can be estimated from expressions

Ntot ∼ δπnb0σ2

r L0/k3

nb ∼ δnb0(σr/R)

(L0/L).

The on-axis amplitude of the linear wake wave excited by the bunch is reduced by the factor T (R) =

1 − RK1(R) < 1 [29] (where K1 is the modiﬁed Bessel function) as compared to the one-dimensional case

(see Sec. II). Therefore, in our case, for the amplitude of wakeﬁeld generated by the bunch, we have:

Eb,max ≈ T Lnb/np. This wakeﬁeld can be neglected when Eb,max ≪ Ez,max, or taking into account (20)
- if δT L0(σr/R)2(nb0/np) ≪ 1; when R ≪ 1, T ≈ R2/2, and this condition reads δL0σ2

r nb0/2np ≪ 1.

Total number of bunch electrons, according to (19), is restricted by the following condition: Ntot ≪
πnpk−3

p (R2/T ) ≈ 1.4 × 107(R2/T )λp[µm].
For the normalized emittance εn = σ2

0/β (here σ0 is the matched transverse size of the bunch, β is
the betatron length) of the accelerating bunch, in our notations, one can write εn ∼ R2Ωλp/4π2. In the
case λp = 100µm (np ≈ 1017cm−3), for the bunch presented in Fig. 12, εn ∼ 8nm/γ1/2; for example,

εn ∼ 0.5nm when γ = 300, that is comparable with the emittance expected in the TeV-range laser

wakeﬁeld accelerator [30,31] (see also Refs. [14,31-34] for the dynamics of accelerating bunch).

IV. SUMMARY

The results of the present work show the possibility of trapping, essential compression both in lon-

gitudinal and transverse directions and ultra-relativistic acceleration of an initially non-relativistic or

weakly-relativistic electron bunch in moderately nonlinear (a0 ∼ 1, Ez,max ∼ 1) laser wakeﬁeld. The

initial bunch can be generated, for example, by a photocathode. So far as electron bunch is initially

non-relativistic (γ0 ∼ 1), trapping and compression take place during time interval comparable with the

plasma wave period, that is much less than the time scale of longitudinal dynamics of relativistic particles

in the wake [33]. Due to the fact that trapped bunch sizes are essentially less than characteristic spatial

scales of the wake wave, the energy spread in the accelerated bunch can be relatively low, namely few

percent. In our scheme the problems connected with the wake wavefront curvature also are removed.

The electron bunch trapped and accelerated can be accelerated further in the multi-stage LWFA [31].

Thus, the scheme of LWFA proposed, has the following advantages: (a) instead of injection of an

enough dense relativistic electron bunch with small sizes (in order of a micrometer), our scheme utilizes

a non-relativistic, rare and long electron bunch, that is much easier to get technically, (b) femtosecond

electron bunch synchronization in the laser wakeﬁeld is not required, (c) eﬀective electron bunch com-

pression, and (d) spatial and energetic separation of the initial electron bunch, that can decrease the

trapped bunch emittance.

ington, DC) for helpful discussions.

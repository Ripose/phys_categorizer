I. INTRODUCTION

Relativistic plasma embedded in a strong magnetic ﬁeld exhibits itself in a variety of interest-

ing astrophysical events from pulsar winds to blackhole magnetospheres [1, 2, 3]. Waves and

instabilities for a single ﬂuid with isotropic pressure have been investigated in the relativistic

magnetohydrodynamic framework [4, 5]. The equation of state of plasma have also been subject

of study when the strong magnetic ﬁeld suppresses the equilibration of pressures parallel and

perpendicular to itself [6]. Plane magnetosonic waves have been studied for a single relativistic

ﬂuid with anisotropic pressures [7, 8]. However, systems in which radiation can provide the

mechanism for viscosity and heat conduction, the bulk shear can be eﬀective. Fluid (imperfect

ﬂuids) systems with isotropic pressure and dissipative eﬀects have been put to investigations

by Wienberg [2, 9].

The present paper intends to consider the eﬀect of bulk viscosity on the plane wave propagation

in relativistic magnetized plasma. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present the

basic equations used in the present paper emphasizing the new energy-momentum tensor. In

Sec. III the general dispersion relations are obtained and their derivation method is described

brieﬂy. In Sec. IV, to the ﬁrst order of dissipation, the dispersion relation is discussed under

various limits.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

We consider a plasma embedded in a magnetic ﬁeld. Plasma ﬂuid velocity and temperature

both are allowed to be relativistic. Hereafter, we will use units where velocity of light c = 1.

Let U α be the plasma 4-velocity and F αβ be the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor. The plasma

rest-frame electric and magnetic ﬁelds are deﬁned [7] as

Eα≡F αβUβ,

Bα≡ 1
2

ǫαβγδUβFγδ,

respectively. The electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor can then be written in the following form:

F αβ = (EαU β − EβU α) +

ǫαβγδ(BγUδ − BδUγ),

(3)

where ǫαβγδ is a completely antisymmetric tensor and ǫ0123 = 1.

For a hydrodynamical system whose pressure, density and velocity vary appreciably over dis-

tances of the order of mean free path, thermal equibrium is not strictly maintained and the

ﬂuid kinetic energy is dissipated as heat. The presence of weak space-time gradients in an

imperfect ﬂuid has the eﬀect of modifying the energy-momentum tensor [9]. For a ﬂuid system

interacting with radiation and wherein bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipative component,

the stress energy-momentum tensor is

T αβ = W1U αU β − W2ηαβ − W3nαnβ − ζU γ

,γ(U αU β − ηαβ),

where

Here Bα = Bnα and the coeﬃcient of bulk viscosity ζ is positive deﬁnite. The plasma 4-velocity
is normalized as U αUα = 1. The magnetic ﬁeld unit vector nα obeys nαnα = −1. The energy

density ε is in general a function of mass density ρ and the magnetic ﬁeld strenght B, and can

be put in the following functional form [7]:

The pressures are

These equations are in their most general form and are representative of relativistic anisotropic

state.

Invoking the usual frozen-in condition Eα = 0 for the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ﬂuid,

the electromagnetic dual tensor becomes

Gαβ = B(nαU β − nβU α),

and the Maxwell equations yields

The equations of motion of the ﬂuid are contained in the particle and energy-momentum con-

servation laws [2]:

where J α(= ρU α) is the 4-current density.

III. DISPERSION RELATION

The perturbed state is characterized by ρ → ρ+δρ, B → B+δB, U α → U α+δU α, nα → nα+δnα,
and plane wave solutions for the perturbations require that δρ, δB, δU α, δnα ∝ exp (ikαxα). It
should be noted that the condition U αUα = 1 and nαnα = −1 yields the following constraints,

U αδUα = nαδnα = 0.

It is assumed that the coeﬃcient of bulk viscosity ζ does not vary appreciably with variations

in above system parameters (ρ, B, U α).
Substituting in Eqs.(12)-(14) ∂/∂xα → ikα, one obtains the following form:

The frequency and parallel component of the wave vector of the plane waves are deﬁned in the

rest frame of the ﬂuid as:

respectively, and

The coeﬃcients Wi in the expression for the energy-momentum tensor will be function of number

density ρ and magnetic ﬁeld strength B. Hence,

The four-vector deﬁned as lα ≡ ǫαβµνkβUµnν [7] will be orthogonal to the independent vectors

kα, U α and nα i.e., lαUα = lαnα = lαkα = 0. Multiplication of Eqs.(15)-(17) by lα , one obtains

This yields the corresponding dispersion relation for the Alfven wave:

Unmagnetized Plasma :

In the absence of magnetic ﬁeld, the energy density ε = ε(ρ) and isotropy prevails i.e., W3 = 0;

and to the ﬁrst order of dissipative term [9], we obtain

In this case we observe that the magnetosonic modes can grow or decay accordingly as L⊥ > 0

4π

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

or L⊥ < 0. In the latter case the system tends to return to its equilibrium state while in the

former instability grows. A state characterized by L⊥ = 0 represents propagation of harmonics

in the direction transverse to the magnetic ﬁeld unlike the unmagnetized-isotropic state wherein

the harmonics can propagate only upto its few characteristic lengths.

Shrauner [10] proposed a generalized polytrope model for the MHD set of equations for con-

sidering the collisional, collisionless and the transitional regimes of plasma state. According to

Shrauner, the anisotropic pressures can be written as

pk = CkρνB−α,

p⊥ = C⊥ρδBβ,

(33)

where Ck and C⊥ are positive constants. The polytropic indices ν, α, δ and β are positive

constants and these polytropic relations can be reduced in certain special cases to well known

equations of state for the pressure. From equations (8), (9), (10) and (33) we get the generalized

energy density

ε = a1ρ + a2pk + a3p⊥,

(34)

(35)

(36)

where a1, a2 and a3 are positive constants. The condition for decay of the transverse modes i.e.,

L⊥ < 0 translate into

a2αpk > a3βp⊥ +

B2
4π

.

For a1 = 1, a2 = 1/2 and a3 = 1 we recover the energy density for a plasma state characterized

by nonrelativistic temperatures; ε = ρ + 1

2pk + p⊥. Further, if ν = 3, α = 2, δ = 1 and β = 1,
then the system represents the well known CGL [11] state with pk = Ckρ3/B2 and p⊥ = C⊥ρB.

It is evident that the condition for decay transverse modes in the CGL plasma reads as

pk > p⊥ +

B2
4π

.

This is the usual criterion for ﬁrehose instability in MHD.

We would like to point out that a simple gas of structureless point particles will have negligible

bulk viscosity in the extreme-relativistic or nonrelativistic limits. However, this need not be

the case for a ﬂuid composed of a mixture of highly relativistic and nonrelativistic particles.

It is well known that the exchange of energy between translational and rotational degrees of

freedom gives ordinary diatomic gases an appreciable bulk viscosity. Although the present

analysis assumes that coeﬃcient of bulk viscosity ζ does not vary appreciably, it does depend

on the dynamical variables of the system in the general form ζ = 4bT 4τ [ 1
3

∂ε )ρ]2. Here T is
plasma temperature, b is of the order of Stefan-Boltzmann constant and τ is the free mean time

− ( ∂p

of radiation quanta [9]. In view of this, the present work is an indicative analysis of plasma as

an imperfect ﬂuid and can be explored further.

Abstract

The internal energy of high-density hydrogen plasmas in the temperature

range T = 10, 000 . . . 50, 000K is calculated by two diﬀerent analytical ap-

proximation schemes (method of eﬀective ion-ion interaction potential - EIIP

and Pad´e approach within the chemical picture - PACH) and compared with

path integral Monte Carlo results. Reasonable agreement between the results

obtained from the three independent calculations is found, the reasons for still

existing diﬀerences is investigated. Interesting high density phenomena such

as the formation of clusters and the onset of crystallization are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The thermodynamics of strongly correlated Fermi systems at high pressure are of grow-

ing importance in many ﬁelds, including shock and laser plasmas, astrophysics, solids and

nuclear matter, see Refs. [1–5] for an overview. In particular, the thermodynamic properties

of hot dense plasmas are essential for the description of plasmas generated by strong lasers

[5]. Further, among the phenomena of current interest are the high-pressure compressibility

of deuterium [6], metallization of hydrogen [7], plasma phase transition etc., which occur in

situations where both interaction and quantum eﬀects are relevant. Among the early theo-

retical papers on dense hydrogen we refer to Wigner/Huntington [8], Abrikosov [9], Ashcroft

[10] and Brovman et al. [11] and, concerning the plasma phase transition, see Norman and

Starostin [12], Kremp et al. [13], Saumon and Chabrier [14] and Schlanges et al. [15], as well

as to some earlier investigations of one of us [16–19]. Among the early simulation approaches

we refer to several Monte Carlo (MC) calculations, e.g. [20–22].

There has been signiﬁcant progress in recent years in studying these systems analyt-

ically and numerically, see e.g. [1,2,4,23–27] for an overview. However, there remains an

urgent need to test analytical models by an independent numerical approach. Besides the

molecular dynamics approach, e.g. [23,25], the path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method

is particularly well suited to describe thermodynamic properties in the region of high den-

sity. This is because it starts from the fundamental plasma particles - electrons and ions,

(physical picture) and treats all interactions, including bound state formation, rigorously

and selfconsistently. We notice remarkable recent progress in applying these techniques to

Fermi systems, for an overview see e.g. Refs. [1,2,28,29].

Several methods have been developed to perform quantum MC. First we mention the

restricted PIMC method [30–33]; here special assumptions on the density operator ˆρ are

introduced in order to reduce the sum over permutations to even (positive) contributions

only. It can be shown, however, that this method does not reproduce the correct ideal Fermi

gas limit [34]. An alternative are direct fermionic PIMC simulations which have occasionally

2

been attempted by various groups. Recently, three of us have proposed a new path integral

representation for the N-particle density operator [35–38] which allows for direct fermionic

path integral Monte Carlo simulations of dense plasmas in a wide range of densities and

temperatures. Using this concept, the pressure and energy of a degenerate strongly coupled

hydrogen plasma have been computed [36–39] as well as the pair distribution functions in

the region of partial ionization and dissociation [37,38]. This scheme is rather eﬃcient when

the number of time slices (beads) in the path integral is less or equal 50 and was found to

work well for temperatures kBT > 0.1Ry.

One diﬃculty of PIMC simulations is that reliable error estimates are often not available,

in particular for strongly coupled degenerate systems. Here, we will make a comparison

with two independent analytical methods. The ﬁrst is the method of an eﬀective ion-ion

interaction potential (EIIP) which has previously been developed for application to simple

solid and liquid metals [11,23] and which is here, for the ﬁrst time adopted to dense hydrogen.

The second is the method of Pad´e approximations in combination with Saha equations, i.e.

the chemical picture (PACH) [3]. The Pad´e formulas are constructed on the basis of the

known analytical limits of low density [3,40] and high density [3], and they are exact up to

quadratic terms in the density, interpolating between the virial expansions and the high-

density asymptotics [18,41,42].

We will show here that both methods, EIIP and PACH provide results for the internal

energy which agree well with each other at high densities where the electrons are strongly

degenerate and no bound states exist, approximately for n > 1024cm−3. In this region, there

is also good agreement with recent density functional results [43]. The agreement with the

PIMC results is very good below 1022cm−3. For intermediate densities, where the degree

of ionization changes strongly, we observe deviations. Also, at high densities, the PIMC

results, tend to lower energies than the analytical approaches. Finally, they reveal several

interesting eﬀects, such as the formation of clusters and the onset of ion crystallization.

II. PHYSICAL PARAMETERS AND BASIC EFFECTS

Let us study a hydrogen plasma consisting of Ne electrons and Np protons (Ne = Np).

The total proton (atom) density is n = Np/V . The average distance between the elec-

trons is the Wigner-Seitz radius d = [3/4πn]1/3, and other characteristic lengths are the

Bohr radius aB = ~/me2, the Landau length l = e2/kT and the De Broglie wave length

Λe = h/[2πmekT ]1/2 of the electrons. The degeneracy parameter is nΛ3

e. We deﬁne the

dimensionless temperature τ = kT /Ry which, in the considered below temperature interval,

varies between 0.06 < τ < 0.4. Furthermore, we introduce the Wigner-Seitz parameter

rs = d/aB and the dimensionless classical coupling strength Γ = e2/(kT d).

Hydrogen is anti-symmetric with respect to the charges (e− =

e+) and symmetric with

−

respect to the densities (n+ = n− = n) and, due to the big mass diﬀerence, mp = 1836 me,

ions and electrons behave quite diﬀerently. At the considered temperatures, the ions may be

treated classically as long as n . 1027 cm−3. Further, for these temperatures and densities,

the proton coupling parameter is in the range 0 < Γ < 150, i.e. we expect strong coupling

eﬀects. We study in this work the internal energies of the ﬂuid hydrogen system and start

with providing some simple estimates for guidance. In the following we will give all energies

in Rydberg units.

units)

First, at very low densities the electrons and the protons behave like an ideal Boltzmann

gas. Therefore, the energy per proton (of free electrons and protons) is given by (in Rydberg

In other words the low-density limit is, in our temperature interval, a positive number in the

1.2. With increasing density we expect a region where atoms and, possibly

also a few molecules, are formed [16,38]. In the region of atoms a lower bound for the energy

where the last term represents the binding energy 1Ry of H-atoms. If molecules are formed,

the corresponding estimate per proton is still lower

Generally, the existence of a lower bound for the energy per proton was proven by Dyson

and Lenard [44] and Lieb and Thirring [45]

where the best estimate known to us (which certainly is much too large), is C

23 [45]. We

see that, with increasing density, the energy per proton tends to negative values and may

reach a ﬁnite minimum. Further density increase will cause the energy to increase again as

a result of quantum degeneracy eﬀcts.

In order to understand this increase let us look ﬁrst at the limit of very high density

(still in the region where the protons are classical). Then the ﬁrst estimate of the energy is

which is positive. The last term, representing the Fermi energy of the electrons, is strongly

increasing with density (with power n2/3). In the next approximation according to Wigner’s

estimate we have to take into account the Hartree contribution to the electron energy and

a corresponding estimate for the proton energy. The proton energy is estimated under the

assumption that protons form a lattice. This way we ﬁnd the estimate

The two corrections that were added to Eq. (5) are both negative and scale like n1/3. In

other words, these interaction terms might play a major role with decreasing density. At a

critical density the energy per proton may become negative. This densitiy can be estimated

from Eq. (6) by solving the quadratic equation

This result coincides, for τ

0, with Wigner’s criterion for the existence of molecules:

→

for d < aB, molecules cannot exist since there is no room for forming bound state wave

functions. According to Eq. (8), for ﬁnite temperature, molecules exist only for still larger d

as thermal ﬂuctuations increase the wave function overlap. More generally, with increasing

temperature, the energy becomes positive at lower density compared to the case T = 0.

Summarizing the qualitative results obtained in this section we may state that we expect,

in the given temperature range, the following general behavior of the internal energy per

proton: at zero density the energy starts with the ideal gas expression which depends only

on the temperature. With increasing density the energy per proton becomes negative due to

correlation eﬀects (bound states, electron correlations, proton correlations). A minimum is

formed and at a density where the proton density is close to the inverse Bohr radius cubed

the energy per proton turns to positive values and is more and more determined by the

ideal electron energy increasing with n2/3, corrected by correlation contributions of order

n1/3 which are determined by the Hartree term and by proton-proton coupling eﬀects. In

the following we will show that this qualitative picture is supported by the results of our

calculations.

III. METHOD OF AN EFFECTIVE ION-ION INTERACTION POTENTIAL

It is well known that in plasmas and plasma-like systems, in a broad parameter range,

the interaction between the electron and ion subsystems is weak, whereas the interacrtions

within the electron and ion subsystems can be strong. The corresponding small parameter

is the ratio uei/EF of the characteristic value of electron–ion interaction uei to the elec-

tron Fermi energy EF . Therefore, the mentioned approximation is valid for systems with

6

degenerate electrons, if EF ≫
tures respectively (below we will consider the case Te = Ti). Typical systems for which this

Te ≥

approximation is fulﬁlled are simple solid and liquid metals and non-transitional metals in

general, and this approximation serves as the basis for the computation of thermodynamic

and electron kinetic properties, e.g. [23,46].

For simple metals the Fermi energy is not very large compared to the characteristic

electron–ion Coulomb interaction, taken at the average interparticle distance. However, due

to the orthogonality of the wave functions for the conduction electrons and electrons bound

in the ion shells, there is a partial compensation of the electron–ion Coulomb attraction at

small distances which eﬀectively weakens the electron–ion interaction. This fact is described

in the theory of simple metals in the framework of the so called pseudopotential theory. The

calculation of the pseudopotential is, in general, a complicated problem in particular due to

its non-local structure [46,47]. For practical applications it can be represented approximately

as a local interaction with one or two ﬁtting parameters for each metal. On basis of the

pseudopotential theory all thermodynamic properties and electronic kinetic coeﬃcients can

be calculated with suﬃciently high accuracy for a wide range of temperatures and pressures.

Naturally, these calculations require reliable knowledge of the properties of the two quasi–

independent subsystems: the degenerate electron liquid on the positive charge background

and the classical ion subsystem with some eﬀective strong inter-ion interaction.

It is apparent that there is also a wide range of parameters for highly ionized strongly

compressed hydrogen plasmas, where the electron–ion interaction is weak. For these param-

eters the complicated problem of calculating the properties of a strongly coupled quantum

electron–proton system can be essentially simpliﬁed. In so doing, the results obtained for

high compression (when no bound electron states – hydrogen atoms and molecules – are

existing), do not require any ﬁtting, in contrast to the case of simple metals, because the

inter–ion potential for hydrogen is pure Coulomb. Therefore, the data obtained with this

analytical approximation, can be considered as an reliable basis for comparison with the re-

sults of alternative approaches, including analytical and simulation methods for degenerate

7

quantum systems of Fermi particles. The results of this pseudopotential approach are espe-

cially important for conditions of extreme compression where the plasma is characterized by

strong interaction within the electron and, especially, the ion subsystem. For these diﬃcult

situations experimental data are still missing whereas new acurate numerical methods for

Fermi system are only emerging.

Let us consider the Hamiltonian of an electron–proton plasma, for which the terms with

inﬁnite zero-components of the potentials are canceled, due to quasineutrality (for generality

we retain the charge number Z of the ions):

component of the electron–proton interaction potential. For the electron degrees of freedom

in the Hamiltonian H the representation of second quantization is used where a†

p and ap are,

respectively, the operators of creation and annihilation of an electron with momentum p .

For the classical ions the coordinate representation is more convenient, thus in Eq. (9) Ri

denotes the coordinate of the i-th ion. To calculate the plasma energy, as in the theory of

simple metals [11,23], two main approximations have to be used. The ﬁrst is the adiabatic

approximation for the ion motion, which is slow compared to the electron one. The second

is the smallness of the ratio of the characteristic electron–proton Coulomb interaction to the

Fermi energy EF . The respective parameter is Γei =

the electron energy in the external ﬁeld of the immobile ions (protons) leads to the energy

of the plasma given as function of the ion coordinates Rj.

In general, the perturbation

theory in terms of the parameter Γei gives rise not only to pair but, naturally, also to higher

order ion–ion interactions, which are rather complicated. To second order of perturbation

theory in the parameter Γei the energy per one electron of a plasma with a ﬁxed proton

Here ǫe is the energy (per ion) of the correlated electron liquid on the homogeneous positive

are related to one another by the usual equality:

εe(q) = 1 +

It is clear that, in contrast to liquid metals, where the presence of the pseudopotential

leads to a more complicated structure of the eﬀective potential, in a dense hydrogen plasma,

the eﬀective potential is determined only by electron screening. As it was shown in [11] for

liquid metals, the additional pair interaction, arising from third and fourth order terms in

the expansion of the electron energy in terms of the pseudopotential can play an important

role in the eﬀective interaction. For the eﬀective potential of a hydrogen plasma a recent

detailed analysis of these terms [48] showed that these terms are essential only for rather

rariﬁed plasma conditions (rs > 1.5), and they are practically negligible for higher densities,

rs < 1.5, which we are considering in this paper.

In fact, for rs > 1.6, the structure of

the eﬀective ion-ion potential in hydrogen changes drastically and can be considered as

precursor of the appearence of molecular states.

In this paper, we will use the simplest

9

version of the method of an eﬀective ion-ion potential (EIIP) which includes the electron-

proton interaction up to second order, so we are restricted to suﬃciently high densities,

corresponding to rs < 1.5.

Further progress can be made by using for Πe the random phase approximation (RPA),

together with the long-wavelength and short-wavelength limits,

ΠRPA(q) = ΠRPA(0)

where ~qF = √2mǫF is the Fermi momentum of the electrons. The analysis of this expression

shows that the main contribution to the energy (10) comes from the small wave numbers.

Therefore, with suﬃcient accuracy, it is possible to neglect the q-dependence of Πe in Eq. (10)

and, in particular, in the eﬀective potential (12), replacing ΠRPA(q)

ΠRPA(0). This means,

→

we also neglect the well-known small oscillations of the eﬀective potential for large distances,

which are the result of a logarithmic singularity of the derivative

|q=2qF . For the
densities under consideration (which are much higher than usual metallic densities), these

(cid:0)

oscillations are not essential for the thermodynamic functions. At the same time, it is crucial

to calculate the polarization function Πe(0) fully selfconsistently:

(15)

where ǫe is determined by (10) and, consequently, takes into account the electron-electron

exchange and correlations. For the case of degenerate electrons we can use one of the

analytical approximations for ǫe such as, for example, that of Nozieres and Pines or Wigner,

see e.g. [49] for an overview. Below we use Wigner’s formula for the correlation energy,

although for small rs the approximation of Nozieres and Pines is better (in fact, for the

region rs < 1, where the deviations between these approximations for the correlation energy

become essential, we can neglect correlations at all in comparison to kinetic and exchange

terms). Because ΠRPA

(0) = κ2

T F /(4πe2) it is clear that Eq. (15) means renormalization of

Because for the considered approximation the eﬀective proton-proton potential is described

same accuracy). From expression (21) follows that the energy of a classical one-component

PACH-approximation we will calculate the internal energy for the 3 isotherms T = 10, 000K,

30, 000K, and 50, 000K for those regions of the density where bound states (atoms and

molecules) play a minor role. In other words we restrict our study to the density region

where the plasma is strongly (but not necessarily fully) ionized. This method works only

with analytical formulae which are, however, rather complicated; nevertheless the calculation

of one energy data point takes no more than a few seconds on a PC.

The Pad´e approximations were constructed in earlier work from the known analytical

results for limiting cases of low density [3,40] and high density [3]. The structure of the Pad´e

approximations was devised in such a way that they are analytically exact up to quadratic

terms in the density (up to the second virial coeﬃcient) and interpolate between the virial

expansions and the high-density asymptotic expressions [18,41,42]. The formation of bound

states was taken into account by using a chemical picture.

We follow in large here this cited work, only the contribution of the OCP-ion-ion inter-

action which is, in most cases, the largest one, was substantially improved following [54].

With respect to the chemical picture we restricted ourselves to the region of strong ioniza-

tion where the number of atoms is still relatively low and where no molecules are present.

We will discuss here only the general structure of the Pad´e formulae. The internal energy

density of the plasma is given by

Here Eid is the internal energy of an ideal plasma consisting of Fermi electrons, classical

protons and classical atoms and Eint is the interaction energy which is represented by

E = Eid + Eint

Eint = Np (ǫe + ǫi + ǫa)

(30)

(31)

The splitting of the interaction contribution to the internal energy corresponds largely

to the previous section. We have:

The electron-electron interaction: This term corresponds to the OCP energy of the

•

electron subsystem. Instead of the simple expressions used in earlier work [18,41,39] we

14

used here a more reﬁned formula for the energy [52]. This formula is an interpolation

between the Hartree limit with the Gellman-Brueckner correction (used already in the

previous section), the Wigner limit and the Debye law including quantum corrections

formulas are valid also for other thermodynamic functions by adjusting the constants

[52]. The formula we have used here for the OCP contains all terms taken into account

in the previous section but, in addition, also temperature dependent corrections.

The ion contribution to the internal energy ǫi. This term was calculated in the previous

•

section. Here we will use a procedure which is based on the approximation (27, 28).

This enables us to use results of the MC-calculations of Hansen, DeWitt and others

[22,53]. According to Eqs. (27, 28) the ion contribution is split into two terms

ǫi = ǫOCP
i

+ ǫP OL

(34)

where the ﬁrst represents the OCP-contribution of the protons and the second the

polarization of the proton OCP by the electron gas. For the region of high densities, i.e.

We note that the polarization term describes the correction due to screening of the

proton-proton interaction by the electron ﬂuid. In order to obtain these expressions,

semiclassical MC calculations were performed based on eﬀective ion interactions which

model the electrons as a responding background [21,22]. We do not need to go into

the details of this method since the procedure corresponds to Eq. (29) derived in the

last section.

Here, the temperature functions B1 and C1 describe rather complex quantum correc-

tions which are, however, explicitly known and are easily programmed [3]. The Pad´e

approximations which connect the high and the low density limits are constructed

by standard methods [18,41,42] and will not be given here in explicit form. For the

OCP-energy of the ions we use the very accurate formulas proposed by Kahlbaum [54].

The atomic contribution: In the region of densities and temperatures which is studied

•

in this work this contribution gives only a small correction. We calculate the number

of atoms on the basis of a nonideal Saha equation. The formation of molecules is

not taken into account. We restrict the calculations to a region where the number

density of atoms is so small, that the degree of ionization is larger than 75%. The

contributions to the chemical potential which appear in the Saha equation are calcu-

lated, in part, from scaling relations and, in part by numerical diﬀerentiation of the

free energy given earlier [18,41]. For the partition function in the Saha equation we

use the Brillouin-Planck-Larkin expression [3,42]. The nonideal Saha equation which

determines the degree of ionization (the density of the atoms) is solved by 5-100 it-

erations starting from the ideal Saha equation. Due to the high degree of ionization,

the atomic interaction contributions can be approximated in the simplest way by the

16

second virial contribution and by treating the atoms as small hard spheres.

The results of our Pad´e calculations for a broad density interval for three isotherms are

included in Figs. 1–3.

V. SUMMARY OF THE PATH INTEGRAL MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS

The analytical approximations discussed in the previous sections work very well at high

densities and if bound states are of minor importance. These conditions are not fulﬁlled for

densities below than the Mott point corresponding to rs > 1. Here, recently developed path

integral Monte Carlo simulations can be used. Starting from the basic plasma particles,

electrons and ions, they “automatically” account for bound state formation and ionization

and dissociation. Furthermore, in contrast to a chemical picture, no restrictions on the type

of chemical species are made and the appearance of complex aggregates such as molecular

ions or clusters of several atoms are fully included. On the other hand, the simulations are

becoming increasingly diﬃcult at high density where the electron degenercy is large. For

this reason it is of high interest to compare results of the PIMC approach with alternative

theories as they are expected to complement each other. This will be done in the next

section.

But ﬁrst, we brieﬂy outline the idea of our direct PIMC scheme. All thermodynamic

properties of a two-component plasma are deﬁned by the partition function Z which, for the

case of Ne electrons and Np protons, is given by

Z(Ne, Np, V, β) =

of the density matrix

, whereas exchange eﬀects are accounted for by the permutation

operator ˆP , which acts on the electron coordinates and spin projections, and the sum over

the permutations with parity κP . In the fermionic case (minus sign), the sum contains Ne!/2

positive and negative terms leading to the notorious sign problem. Due to the large mass

diﬀerence of electrons and ions, the exchange of the latter is not included.

To compute thermodynamic functions, the logarithm of the partition function has to be

diﬀerentiated with respect to thermodynamic variables. In particular, the internal energy

E follows from Q by

The potential Φab appearing in Eq. (42) is an eﬀective quantum pair interaction between

The structure of Eq. (42) is obvious: we have separated the classical ideal gas part

(ﬁrst term). The ideal quantum part in excess of the classical one and the correlation

contributions are contained in the integral term, where the second line results from the

19

ionic correlations (ﬁrst term) and the e-e and e-i interaction at the ﬁrst vertex (second and

third terms respectively). Thus, Eq. (42) contains the important limit of an ideal quantum

plasma in a natural way. The third and fourth lines are due to the further electronic

vertices and the explicit temperature dependence [in Eq. (42)] and volume dependence (in

the corresponding equation of state result) of the exchange matrix, respectively. The main

advantage of Eq. (42) is that the explicit sum over permutations has been converted into

the spin determinant which can be computed very eﬃciently using standard linear algebra

methods. Furthermore, each of the sums in curly brackets in Eq. (42) is bounded as the

number of vertices increases, n

. The error of the total expression is of the order of

→ ∞

1/n. Thus, expression (42) and the analogous result for the equation of state are well suited

for numerical evaluation using standard Monte Carlo techniques, e.g. [20,28].

In our Monte Carlo scheme we used three types of steps, where either electron or proton

coordinates, ri or qi or inidividual electronic beads ξ(k)

i were moved until convergence of the

calculated values was reached. Our procedure has been extensively tested. In particular,

we found from comparison with the known analytical expressions for pressure and energy

of an ideal Fermi gas that the Fermi statistics is very well reproduced [37]. Further, we

performed extensive tests for few–electron systems in a harmonic trap where, again, the

analytically known limiting behavior (e.g. energies) is well reproduced [60,61]. For the

present simulations of dense hydrogen, we varied both the particle number and the number

of time slices (beads). As a result of these tests, we found that to obtain convergent results

for the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen in the density-temperature region of interest

here, particle numbers Ne = Np = 50 and beads numbers in the range of n = 6 . . . 20 are an

acceptable compromise between accuracy and computational eﬀort [36–38].

VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS. COMPARISON OF THE ANALYTICAL AND

SIMULATION DATA

Let us now come to the numerical results. We have computed the internal energy of dense

hydrogen using the two analytical (EIIP and PACH) approaches and the PIMC simulations.

The data are shown in Figs. 1–3 for three temperatures, 10, 000K, 30, 000K and 50, 000K,

respectively.

Consider ﬁrst the general behavior which is clearly seen for the lowest temperature, cf.

Fig. 1.b. The overall trend is an increase of the energy with density which is particularly

rapid at high densities due to electron degeneracy eﬀects; this is clearly seen from the ideal

plasma curve (dash-dotted line). The nonideal plasma results show a prominent deviation

from this trend which is in full agreement with the discussion given in Section II: the

formation of an energy minimum (where the energy may become negative) at intermediate

densities. Our calculations for a nonideal hydrogen plasma asymptotically approach the

ideal curve both, at low density (ideal classical plasma) and at high density (ideal mixture

of classical protons and quantum electrons). At intermediate densities, between 1019cm−3

and 1025cm−3, the nonideal plasma energy is signiﬁcantly lower than the ideal energy which

is due to strong correlations and formation of bound states. In particular, we see clearly

that indeed, for the considered temperatures, the total energy reaches negative values.

Let us now compare the results from the diﬀerent methods. First, we see that the energy

minimum is reproduced by all methods, but there are quantitative diﬀerences regarding its

depth and width. The general observation made for all temperatures, cf. also Figs. 2 and

3, is that the simulations yield a deeper minimum and shift of the energy increase towards

higher densities. Before further analyzing these diﬀerences, we concentrate on the results

of the analytical approaches. For all temperatures (including higher ones), the PACH and

EIIP approaches coincide in the limit of high densities. This is an important test since both

contain the ideal Fermi gas result as a limiting case for high degeneracy. The interesting

result is that this agreement holds up to densities as low as n = 1024cm−3. For still lower

21

densities, the EIIP method yields lower energies which are closer to the PIMC results. At

these densities, atom and molecule formation is becoming important, and both analytical

methods (in their present form) are becoming unreliable. (For this reason, the Pad´e curve

in Fig. 1.a is discontinued below 1023cm−3, and in Fig. 2 the uncertain region is indicated

by the dotted curve.)

It interesting compare to another theoretical approach based on density functional (DFT)

calculations. Recently, Xu and Hansen [43] published data for T = 10, 000K and rs ≤
1.5 which are also included in Fig. 1. These calculations which also neglect bound state

formation practically coincide with the PACH results. The good agreement of the three

completely independent approaches - EIIP, PACH and DFT - is a strong indication that

they are able to yield reliable results for a fully ionized macroscopic hydrogen plasma at

high densities, rs ≤

1.5.

Let us now turn to the comparison with the PIMC simulations. As noted above, the

overall agreement of all methods is satisfactory in view of the strength of correlation and

quantum eﬀects. Nevertheless, we observe deviations of our PIMC results from all other

data, in particular around the energy minimum. Our data for T = 10, 000K are also lower

than restricted PIMC results of Militzer et al. [33], cf. Fig. 1.b, whereas we found excellent

quantitative agreement between the two independent quantum Monte Carlo methods above

T = 50, 000K, see the point for T = 62, 500K in Fig. 3.a, (see also Ref. [39]). The reason for

the low energies observed in our PIMC simulations at T = 10, 000K are ﬁnite size eﬀects:

the homogeneous plasma state is unstable in the density region of the energy minimum.

An analysis of the electron-proton conﬁgurations reveals that the plasma gains energy by

forming small droplets [64] which is a direct indication for a ﬁrst order phase transition as

discussed in the Introduction. These eﬀects begin to appear in the weakly ionized plasma

and are not contained in the present variants of the PACH and EIIP methods although they

have been analyzed before [65]. It is interesting to note that Xu and Hansen [43] observed

strong ﬂuctuations in their density functional calculations below rs = 1.5 which strongly

resembled precursors of a phase transition. To clearify this interesting issue more in detail

22

requires extensive simulations which are presently under way.

For completeness, we mention further eﬀects which tend to lower the total energy and

which are neglected in the analytical approaches: increased electron polarization and non-

additive terms in the eﬃcient proton-proton interaction which were analyzed by Kagan and

co-workers [11].

The next interesting feature of the PIMC simulations is the shift of the energy growth to

higher density values compared to the analytical models. This tendency becomes stronger

with increasing temperature, as can be seen in Figs. 1–3. There is no reason to doubt that the

analytical methods (in accord with the density functional results) yield the correct energy

asymptotics of a macroscopic electron-proton plasma at very high densities. (Account of

proton degeneracy eﬀects which are not included would only further increase the energies.)

As noted above, our direct PIMC simulations become increasingly diﬃcult with growing

electron degeneracy, so we expect the results to become less accurate for densities exceeding

1025cm−3.

However, the most important eﬀect results again from the ﬁnite-size character of our

simulations. To better understand the high-density results, we analyze in Fig. 4 the electron-

electron (e-e), proton-proton (p-p) and electron-proton (e-p) pair distribution functions.

These functions exhibit features typical for strongly correlated systems. The most prominent

eﬀect is seen in the p-p function which exhibits a periodic structure at T = 50, 000K which

is even more pronounced at T = 10, 000K. This proton ordering is typical for a strongly

correlated ion ﬂuid which is near the crystallization temperature [66]. Our simulations for

still higher densities show the formation of an ionic lattice immersed into a delocalized sea

of electrons, i.e. an ionic Wigner crystal as it is known to exist in high density objects

such as White or Brown dwarf stars. Thus, qualitatively, the simulations show the correct

behavior at high densities. But due to the small size of the simulations (only 50 electrons and

protons are presently feasible), the results are much closer to those for small ionic clusters

which are known to exhibit quite peculiar behavior, including strong size dependence of

the energy, negative speciﬁc heat etc. Therefore, in order to obtain more accurate data

23

for the internal energy of a macroscopic two-component plasma at ultrahigh compression,

a signiﬁcant increase of the simulation size is desirable which should become feasible in the

near future.

VII. DISCUSSION

This work is devoted to the investigation of the thermodynamic properties of hot dense

plasmas in the temperature region between 10, 0000 and 50, 000K. We presented a new

theoretical approach to high-density plasmas which is based on the theory of an eﬀective

ion-ion potential (EIIP). This method is shown to be quite eﬃcient for fully ionized strongly

correlated plasmas above the Mott density.

Furthermore, a detailed comparison of several theoretical approaches on one hand and

simulations on the other, has been performed over a wide density range. The ﬁrst include

the analytical models EEIP and the PACH on one hand and recent density functional data

of Xu and Hansen [43] on the other hand. The second group of data includes several new

data points based on direct path integral Monte Carlo simulations (PIMC) of a correlated

proton-electron system with degenerate electrons. In addition, we compared with restricted

PIMC data of Militzer et al. [33].

From this comparison we conclude that the three theoretical approaches are in very good

agreement with each other for a fully ionized hydrogen plasma in the high density region

where rs < 1. On the other hand, the two simulations agree with each other for temperatures

above 50, 000K although no RPIMC data for high densities are yet available to us. This

agreement over a broad range of parameters is certainly remarkable since the plasma is far

outside the perturbative regime: it is strongly correlated and the electrons are degenerate.

Moreover, all considered methods are essentially independent.

Finally, the comparison of our PIMC simulation results with the analytical data reveals

an overall good agreement, although deviations are observed above n = 1022cm−3. The

simulation energy reaches a far deeper minimum and the energy increase due to electron

24

degeneracy appears at higher densities. The discrepancy at lower densities (below n =

1023cm−3) was attributed to not adequate treatment of bound state eﬀects in the analytical

methods, whereas the deviations at higher density are most likely due to ﬁnite size eﬀects

encountered by the simulations. These lead to droplet formation at low temperature and

for densities between n = 1023cm−3 and n = 1024cm−3 which are an indication for the

plasma phase transition [64]. At high density, the simulations reveal ordering of protons

into a strongly correlated ﬂuid and onset of the formation of a proton Wigner crystal. These

interesting physical eﬀects in high pressure hydrogen are of relevance for many astrophysical

systems, but also for many laboratory experiments, including ultracold degenerate trapped

ions and laser plasmas.

[65] Using a modiﬁed PACH approach, Beule et al. [19] predicted a ﬁrst order phase tran-

sition in hydrogen for T = 10, 000K with a pressure and density p

110GPa and

≃

0.8gcm−3. Similar results were obtained by Schlanges et al. [15].

[66] In fact, the ﬁrst minimum of the proton-proton function (around r = 0.45aB) for T =

10, 000K is far lower than the standard value of 0.35 typical for a liquid.

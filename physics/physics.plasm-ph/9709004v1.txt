The Analytical Solution of Radiation Transfer Equation for a Layer of
Magnetized Plasma With Random Irregularities

N.A.Zabotin and A.G.Bronin

Rostov State University, Rostov-on-Don,344090, Russia

Abstract

The problem of radio wave reﬂection from an optically thick plane monotonous

layer of magnetized plasma is considered at present work. The plasma electron
density irregularities are described by spatial spectrum of an arbitrary form.
The small-angle scattering approximation in the invariant ray coordinates is
suggested for analytical investigation of the radiation transfer equation. The
approximated solution describing spatial-and-angular distribution of radia-
tion reﬂected from a plasma layer is obtained. The obtained solution can be
applied, for example, to the ionospheric radio wave propagation.

Introduction

Basic goal of the present work consists in derivation of the transfer equation solution
describing spatial-and-angular distribution P (~ρ, ω) of radio radiation reﬂected from
a plane stratiﬁed layer of magnetized plasma with random irregularities.

The radiation transfer equation (RTE) in a randomly irregular magnetized
plasma was obtained in the work [1] under rather general initial assumptions. In
particular, the medium average properties were assumed smoothly varying both in
space and in time. In the work [2] the radiation energy balance (REB) equation
describing radiation transfer in a plane stratiﬁed layer of stationary plasma with
random irregularities has been deduced. The invariant ray coordinates, allowing
one to take into account by a natural way refraction of waves and to represent the
equation in the most simple form, were used there. In the work [3] it was shown that
the equation REB is a particular case of the radiation transfer equation obtained
in [1] and can be deduced from the latter by means of transition to the invariant
ray coordinates.Equation REB, thus, allows one to investigate inﬂuence of multiple
scattering in a plane stratiﬁed plasma layer on the characteristics of radiation. In
particular, it enables one to determine the spatial-and-angular distribution of ra-
diation leaving the layer if the source directivity diagram and irregularity spatial
spectrum are known. A few eﬀects which require of wave amplitudes coherent sum-
mation for their description (for example, phenomenon of enhanced backscattering)
are excluded from consideration. However, the multiple scattering eﬀects are much
stronger, as a rule. This is particularly true for the ionospheric radio propagation.
The numerical methods of the transfer equation solving developed in the theory
of neutron transfer and in the atmospheric optics appear useless for the equation
REB analysis. They are adapted, basically, to the solution of one-dimensional prob-
lems with isotropic scattering and plane incident wave. In a case of magnetized
plasma the presence of regular refraction, aspect-sensitive character of scattering
on anisometric irregularities and high dimension of the equation REB (it contains

1

two angular and two spatial coordinates as independent variables) complicate con-
struction of the eﬀective numerical algorithm for its solving. In this situation it
is expedient to solve the equation REB in two stages. The ﬁrst stage consists of
obtaining of the approximated analytical solution allowing one to carry out the
qualitative analysis of its properties and to reveal of its peculiarities. At the second
stage the numerical estimation methods can be applied to the obtained analytical
solution, or methods of the numerical solving of the initial equation taking into
account the information obtained at the ﬁrst stage can be designed. Therefore the
problem of obtaining of the equation REB approximated analytical solutions is of
interest.

We begin the present paper from a detailed exposition of the invariant ray
coordinates concept. Then possibility to use of the small-angle scattering in the
invariant coordinates approximation is discussed. Two modiﬁcations of the REB
equation solution are obtained. The analysis of the obtained solutions concludes
the paper.

Invariant ray coordinates and the radiation en-
ergy balance equation

It is convenient to display graphically the electromagnetic wave propagation in
a plane-stratiﬁed plasma layer with the aid of the Poeverlein construction [4,5].
We shall brieﬂy describe it. Let the Cartesian system of coordinates has axis z
perpendicular and the plane x0y parallel to the plasma layer. We shall name such
coordinate system “vertical”. It is assumed that the vector of the external magnetic
ﬁeld ~H is situated in the plane z0y . Module of radius-vector of any point inside
of the unit sphere with centrum in the coordinate origin corresponds to the value
of refractive index ni(v, α), where i = 1 relates to the extraordinary wave, i =
relates to the ordinary one, v = ω2
is the plasma frequency, ω2 is the
e /ω2 , ω2
e
frequency of a wave, α is the angle between radius-vector and magnetic ﬁeld ~H .
The refractive index surface corresponding to a ﬁxed value of v and to all possible
directions of the radius-vector represents a rotation body about an axis parallel to
vector ~H (see ﬁg. 1).

Convenience of the described construction (in fact, this is an example of coordi-
nate system in space of wave vectors ~k) is become evident when drawing the wave
trajectory:
it is represented by a straight line, parallel to the axis z . This is a
consequence of the generalized Snell law, which also requires of equality of the fall
angle and exit angle onto/from a layer (θ ), and constantness of the wave vector
azimuth angle ( ϕ). Note, that the crossing point of a wave trajectory with the
refractive index surface under given value of v determines current direction of the
wave vector in a layer (it is anti-parallel to a radius-vector) and current direction
of the group speed vector (it coincides with the normal to the refractive index sur-
face). The projection of a wave trajectory onto the plane x0y is a point which
radius-vector has module sin θ and its angle with relation to axis x equals to ϕ .
Thus, the coordinates deﬁne completely the whole ray trajectory shape in a plane
layer and outside of it and are, in this sense, invariant on this trajectory.

Radiation of an arbitrary point source of electromagnetic waves within the solid
angle θ ÷ θ + dθ; ϕ ÷ ϕ + dϕ corresponds to the energy ﬂux in the ~k-space inside
of a cylindrical ray tube parallel to axis z with cross section sin θd(sin θ)dϕ =
sin θ cos θdθdϕ .
In case of regular (without random irregularities) plasma layer
this energy ﬂux is conserved and completely determined by the source directivity
diagram:

2

P (z; θ, ϕ, ~ρ) = P0(θ, ϕ, ~ρ) ,

(1)

where P is energy ﬂux density in the direction determined by angles θ, ϕ through
the point ~ρ on some base plane situated outside of the layer parallel to it (in the
ionosphere case it is convenient to choose the Earth’ surface as the base plane), z is
distance from the base plane (height in the ionosphere case). We shall assume in the
present paper that function z(v) is monotonous in the region of wave propagation
and reﬂection. If random irregularities are absent and source of radiation is point,
variable ~ρ in (1) is superﬂuous, as the matter of fact, since unequivocal relation
between it and angles of arrival of a ray θ, ϕ exists. When scattering is present
the radiation energy redistributes over angular variables θ, ϕ and in space what is
described by variable ~ρ . The value of P satisﬁes in this case to the equation of
radiation energy balance [2,3]:

is scattering diﬀerential cross section describing intensity of the scattered wave
with wave vector coordinates α, β in magnetic coordinate system (corresponding
invariant coordinates are θ′ and ϕ′) which arises at interaction of the wave with
wave vector coordinates α0, β0 (invariant coordinates θ and ϕ ) with irregularities.
Vector function ~Φ(z; θ′, ϕ′; θ, ϕ) represents the displacement of the point of arrival
onto the base plane of a ray which has angular coordinates θ′ and ϕ′ after scattering
at level z with relation to the point of arrival of an incident ray with angular
coordinates θ, ϕ . It is essential that in a plane-stratiﬁed medium the function ~Φ
is determined only by smoothed layer structure v(z) and does not depend on the
scattering point horizontal coordinate and also on coordinate ~ρ of the incident
and scattered rays. Note also that ratio ~Φ(z; θ, ϕ; θ′, ϕ′) = −~Φ(z; θ′, ϕ′; θ, ϕ) takes
place.

It is possible to check up that equation (2) satisﬁes to the energy conservation
law: when integrating over all possible for level z values of θ, ϕ and all ~ρ its right
side turns into zero. It is natural since in absence of true absorption the energy
inside the plasma layer does not collected.

Analyzing expression for the scattering diﬀerential cross section in a magnetized
plasma (see, for example, [6]), it is easy to be convinced that the following symmetry
ratio takes place:

σ [θ, ϕ; θ′, ϕ′] n2 cos ϑ′

g = σ [θ′, ϕ′; θ, ϕ] n′2 cos ϑg

where ϑg is angle between the wave vector and group speed vector, n is refractive
index. Using (3) the equation (2) can be presented as follows:

Q (z; θ, ϕ; θ′, ϕ′) ≡ Q(z; θ, ϕ; θ′, ϕ′) sin θ cos θ is symmetric with relation to rear-
rangement of shaded and not shaded variables. The equation REB in the form (4)
has the most compact and perfect appearance. It is clear from physical reasons that
(4) has to have the unique solution for given initial distribution P0(θ, ϕ, ~ρ). The ob-
tained equation can be directly used for numerical calculation of the signal strength
spatial distribution in presence of scattering. However, as it was noted at intro-
duction already, this approach leads to essential diﬃculties. Subsequent sections
describe the method of construction of the energy balance equation approximated
analytical solution.

variant ray coordinates

Let us consider the auxiliary equation of the following kind, which diﬀers from (4)

where designation ω = {θ, ϕ} , dω = dθdϕ has been used for the sake of compact-

mation over variable ~ρ. The solution has the following form:

P (z, ~q, ω) = P0(~q, ω)S(z, 0; ~q, ω),

(6)

where P0(~q, ω) is the Fourier image of the radiation energy ﬂux density passing the
layer in absence of scattering and the value of S is deﬁned by the expression

Thus, auxiliary equation (5) allows to present the solution of the equation (4) in
the form (9). This is an exact representation while some approximated expressions

We shall assume now that the most probable distinction of angles ω′ and ω is
small. The heuristic basis for this assumption is given by analysis of the Poeverlein
construction (ﬁg. 1). It is easy to be convinced examining the Poeverlein construc-
tion that scattering near the reﬂection level even for large angles in the wave vectors
space entails small changes of the invariant angles θ, ϕ. This is especially true for
irregularities strongly stretched along the magnetic ﬁeld (in this case the edges of
scattered waves wave vectors form circles shown in ﬁg. 1 as patterns A and B).
One should note also that the changes of invariant angles θ, ϕ are certainly small
if scattering with small change of a wave vector direction takes place. This situa-
tion is typical for irregularity spectra, in which irregularities with scales more than
sounding wave length dominate. Thus, the small-angle scattering approximation
in the invariant coordinates has wider applicability area than common small-angle
scattering approximation.

Scattering with small changes of θ, ϕ entails small value of

Note that making similar expansion of function P at the initial equation (4) would
be incorrect since function P may not to have property of continuity. For example,
in case of a point source, P0 is a combination of δ -functions. As it will be shown
later, the function X is expressed from P0 by means of repeated integration and,
hence, diﬀerentiability condition fulﬁlls much easier for it.

Generally, expression (12) gives the exact solution of the equation (11). However,
since we are already within the framework of the invariant coordinate small-angle
scattering approximation which assumes small value of Aω(z, ω) , it is possible to
simplify the problem a little. Assuming Aω ∼= 0 and omitting index 0 at invari-
ant coordinates ω , we are coming to the following approximate representation for
function X :

The REB equation solving method stated in the previous section is based on rep-

resentation of quantity P (z, ~ρ, ω)
P (z, ~ρ, ω) and
the regular one X(z0, ~ρ, ω) . Regularity of the X(z0, ~ρ, ω) has allowed one to use
the expansion into the Taylor series over variables ~ρ and ω at the equation (10)
right side and to transform the integral-diﬀerential equation (10) into the ﬁrst order
partial derivative diﬀerential equation (11).

as a sum of the singular part

However, the stated approach is not the only possible. The REB equation can
be transformed right away using Fourier-representation of the function P (z, ~ρ, ω) :

P(z, ~ρ, ω) =

derivation of (13) and subsequent expressions. Let us note, however, that in (21),
in contrast with (9), any additional terms do not appear. It allows one to assume
that in used approximation the ratio

is fulﬁlled. Additional arguments to the beneﬁt of this assumption will be presented
in the following section.

5 Analysis of the solution of the REB equation

We shall show, ﬁrst of all, that the obtained solution satisﬁes to the energy conser-
vation law. For this purpose it is necessary to carry out integration of the left and
right sides of (15) over ω and ~ρ multiplied them previously by sin θ cos θ. The area
of integration over angles is deﬁned by the condition that both wave ω and wave
ω′ achieve the same level z (since at level z their mutual scattering occurs). To
satisfy this condition one should add factors Θ [hr(ω) − z] and Θ [hr(ω′) − z] to the
is the maximum
integrand expression, where Θ(x) is Heviside step function, hr(ω)
height which can be reached by a ray with parameters θ, ϕ . Now integration can
be expanded over all possible values of angles, i.e., over interval 0 ÷ π/2 for θ and
over interval 0 ÷ 2π for ϕ . Then, (15) becomes

expressing the energy conservation law: the radiation energy full ﬂux through the

remains constant regardless of scattering, as it should be in case of real
(dissipative) absorption absence. It is not diﬃcult to check that parity (23) is valid
for the exact solution in the form (9) and also for the solution in the form (21).

With relation to the solution in the form (9) the carried out discussion discovers
one curious peculiarity. It appears that the radiation energy complete ﬂux through
the base plane is determined by the ﬁrst term
. The second one (X) gives
zero contribution to the energy complete ﬂux.

been established in section 4 with the aid of comparison of two variants of the
REB equation solution. Now we see that its presence is determined by structure of
quantity X(z0, ~ρ, ω).

Results of the present section give the weighty ground to believe that the radi-
ation spatial-and-angular distribution is determined basically by the ﬁrst term in
the solution (9). The second term represents the amendment to the solution which
can be neglected in the invariant coordinate small-angle scattering approximation.
This statement validity can be checked under detailed research of properties of the
obtained REB equation approximated solutions by numerical methods.

6 Conclusion

In the present work the heuristic basis for use of the invariant coordinate small-angle
scattering approximation is considered under solving of the RTE for a magnetized
plasma layer. Within the framework of this approximation two versions of the ana-
lytical solution have been obtained. They describe spatial-and-angular distribution
of radiation reﬂected from a monotonous plasma layer with small-scale irregularities.
The ﬁnal physical conclusions about inﬂuence of the multiple scattering eﬀects in
a layer of plasma on the spatial-and-angular characteristics of radiation are possible
on the basis of detailed numerical research of the obtained solutions. Such research
is a subject of other our works.

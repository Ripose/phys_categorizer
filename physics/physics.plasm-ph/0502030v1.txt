Dynamical Alignment in Three Species Tokamak Edge Turbulence

Bruce D. Scott∗
Max-Planck-Institut f¨ur Plasmaphysik, Euratom Association, D-85748 Garching, Germany
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Three dimensional computations of self consistent three species gyroﬂuid turbulence are carried
out for tokamak edge conditions. Proﬁles as well as disturbances in dependent variables are followed,
running the dynamical system to transport equilibrium. The third species density shows a signif-
icant correlation with that of the electrons, regardless of initial conditions and drive mechanisms.
For decaying systems the densities evolve toward each other. Companion tests with a simple two
dimensional drift wave model show this persists even if the third species is a passively advected test
ﬁeld. Similarity in the transport character of electrons and the trace species does not imply that
the electrons themselves have a test particle transport character.

I.

INTRODUCTION — TRACE SPECIES TRANSPORT

It is an interesting question whether the electrons and ions in a magnetically conﬁned plasma are transported
in the same way test particles in a randomly turbulent velocity ﬁeld would be [1, 2, 3, 4]. One might consider to
investigate this by placing test particles or a trace species into an otherwise self consistent turbulence computation or
experimentally by measuring trace species transport and comparing to the transport of the electrons [5]. Not only the
transport coeﬃcients are interesting, but also the basic character, namely, whether or not the transport is a random
walk process [6, 7, 8, 9]. It might be tempting to conclude that if the transport of the trace species were the same as
that of the electrons, then the electrons themselves should be transported essentially randomly.

It is useful to provide a falsiﬁcation constraint on this logic. Gradient driven transport in a magnetised plasma
is usually very diﬀerent from test particle transport in a ﬂuid, due to the strong coupling between the electrostatic
potential, which serves as the stream function for the ExB ﬂuid velocity, and the electron density [10, 11, 12]. The
coupling is eﬀected by the action of parallel currents and produces a strong correlation between the potential and
density. Ultimately, if the electrons are adiabatic (Boltzmann relation vis-a-vis the potential) then there is no net
transport of electrons even though there is turbulence, which could also be driven by the ion temperature [13, 14, 15].
Since ExB transport is ambipolar, it follows that there is also no net transport of ions (neglecting the small charge
density implied by a ﬁnite ExB vorticity). Even in robustly electromagnetic tokamak edge turbulence, where the free
energy comes from the extent to which the electrons are nonadiabatic, the adiabatic response is always of qualitative
importance, and there is a strong correlation between the potential and the electron density [16, 17].

What we will show herein is that in most reasonable circumstances the test particle species, even when it is a tracer
ﬁeld with vanishing inﬂuence upon the electrostatic potential, follows the same dynamics as the electron density. The
process has a very similar appearance and results ultimately from the same mechanism as “dynamical alignment”
between a passively advected density and the vorticity in neutral ﬂuid turbulence [18]. It is a manifestation of (1)
the advective nonlinearity being the most eﬀective process in the equation for each quantity, and (2) each of these
quantities having a strong direct cascade in its squared amplitude (playing the role of an entropy contribution) despite
the fact that the ﬂow energy has an inverse cascade [19]. The basic nonlinear dynamics is suﬃciently general that these
cascade tendencies persist in the presence of strong, dissipative forcing [20]. The result is that any initialised imprint
on the spatial morphology of either variable is quickly transferred to small, dissipative scales, and the subsequent
evolution, being the same for both quantities, produces similar morphology especially at scales within the inertial
range of the turbulence.

The computations are done in three dimensional ﬂux tube geometry, with a fully self consistent three species
gyroﬂuid model [21] with two ion species plus electrons, generalised to allow nonadiabatic, electromagnetic electron
dynamics [22], but restricted to two moments per species in the “GEM3” model with clean energetics and clear
correspondence to ﬂuid edge turbulence models [23]. Not only the evolution of the small scale eddies are followed, but
also that of the zonal proﬁles (ﬂux surface averages, cf. Ref. [3]). This dynamics is followed to transport equilibrium

for cases driven by a source, and for at least one transport decay time for cases with no sources. The trace ion
species is initialised either the same as for the electrons (random bath disturbances plus a proﬁle), or simply with
a narrowly localised proﬁle. In some cases both ion species are given equal background densities. In each case, the
initial diﬀerences are eliminated by the evolution of the turbulence, and at late times the morphology of all species
densities are closely similar, with a high degree of cross correlation between any two of them.

The main result is that even though the electrons are not transported passively, the density of a trace species is
transported the same way as the electrons are. A companion test is given by a simple two dimensional drift wave
model, following only the potential and electron density and their dissipative coupling [11], plus an additional equation
for a third ﬁeld which is the density of a strict test particle species. Here, the regime of the electrons response is varied
from deeply hydrodynamic to adiabatic [18, 19]. In either case, the test particle density closely follows the electron
density, in all regimes, regardless of whether the electron and test particle densities are similarly or diﬀerently driven.
This should serve as a caution against prematurely concluding that the density in a magnetised plasma are passively
advected in the case the electrons and a trace impurity species should be observed to display the same transport
properties.

Following sections document the GEM3 model as used, the results in decaying and driven cases, respectively, and

the results from the dissipatively coupled, two dimensional model. A discussion and summary is given at the end.

II. THE THREE SPECIES GEM3 MODEL

For this study we use the GEM3 model, which allows a ﬁnite background temperature for all species but does
not follow the dynamics of the temperatures or parallel heat ﬂuxes [23]. It allows drift wave and ideal and resistive
ballooning dynamics according to the parameters

controlling the perpendicular drift dynamics and the magnetic curvature eﬀects. Both interchange and geodesic
curvature are retained [24]. Normalisation is in terms of a proﬁle scale L⊥ and the sound speed cs, giving a natural
drift frequency of cs/L⊥. The parallel dynamics is normalised in terms of qR, where the parallel connection length
is 2πqR, giving the qR/L⊥ scale ratios in the parameters. The range of scales under consideration is everything
between the drift scale ρs and the proﬁle scale L⊥. The collisional drift wave regime is roughly C > 1, becoming
electromagnetic if ˆβ > 1.
Ideal and resistive ballooning enter if ˆβωB > 1 or CωB > 1, respectively. The ﬁrst
two conditions are usually satisﬁed but the latter two are not. Hence, the principal physical process is drift Alfv´en
turbulence [16, 17]. Geodesic curvature is always important as its role is to regulate the attendant zonal ExB ﬂows
[24].

The proﬁles as well as the ﬂuctuations in the dependent variables are followed, so that transport as well as turbulence
can be computed, even though the equations are still homogeneous in the normalised parameters. Each species
is characterised by a background charge density, temperature/charge ratio, and mass/charge ratio, given by the
normalised parameters

az = nzZ/ne

τz = Tz/ZTe

µz = Mz/ZMD

(3)

in terms of a reference electron temperature Te and deuterium mass MD. The scale ratio for the parallel dynamics
comes in as ǫz = µz(qR/L⊥)2. For electrons, ae = τe = −1 and µe = −(me/MD). For a single component deuterium
plasma we would have ai = µi = 1 and τi the nominal ion/electron temperature ratio Ti/Te. With two ion species
(the second labelled ’t’) we specify the three parameters independently for each species but then restrict to a neutral
plasma by taking ai = 1 − at. For simplicity we will assume a deuterium/tritium plasma with equal temperatures for
all species.

All of this is in local ﬂux tube geometry deﬁned separately with respect to each drift plane (xyk, deﬁned globally,
orthogonal at s = sk), each on its own globally ﬁeld aligned coordinate system, so that the linear parallel derivative
(∂/∂s) incurs shifts in the y-direction to reﬂect the magnetic shear. The simplest version of the geometry is used,
in which the metric of the coordinate system referenced to each drift plane is unit diagonal on that plane, and the
magnetic ﬁeld strength is B = 1, giving the above Laplacian and curvature operators. This is the “shifted metric”
treatment; for further detail see Ref. [28]. Elsewhere, the subscript on yk is omitted (the form of the Poisson bracket
is unaﬀected).

The equations are solved on a domain Lx × Ly × Ls, with Ls = 2π due to the global consistency constraint. The
boundary conditions on the dependent variables in the drift plane are Dirichlet (vanishing value) at x = Lx/2 and
Neumann (vanishing derivative) at x = −Lx/2, and periodic on −Ly/2 < y < Ly/2, with the x-direction implemented
in terms of the quarter-wave FFT so that the correct value of Γ0 is obtained for each wavenumber. The boundary
conditions on s are deﬁned by global consistency [29], on the interval −π < s < π, implemented using the shifted
metric treatment [28].

The numerical scheme is one which has been used previously in three dimensional drift wave computation [30].
Poisson bracket structures in xy are evaluated with a discretisation which preserves their properties [31]. The linear
∂/∂s and K terms are evaluated using centred diﬀerences. The timestep is a third order scheme using both the
dependent variables and their time derivatives to build the new dependent variables at the next time step [32]. In
contrast to most other methods, this scheme is stable to waves. Nevertheless, the direct thermal free energy cascade
[18, 19] creates the need for numerical dissipation at small scale [17]. This is eﬀected by a diﬀusion −νk∂2/∂s2 and a
hyperdiﬀusion ν⊥∇4
⊥ added to each ExB derivative (applying the dissipation to the moment variables but not directly
to the ﬁelds). The spatial grid node count is 64 × 256 × 16 in xys, on a domain given by Ly = 4Lx = 80πρs = 4L⊥, or
simply 4 in normalised units, and Ls = 2π. The minimum value of kyρs is therefore 0.025. The timestep is τ = 0.05,
and runs are taken to approximately t = 2000. The artiﬁcial dissipation coeﬃcients are νk = 0.003 and ν⊥ = 0.002.

III. GEM3 RESULTS FOR DECAYING CASES

The ﬁrst set of results under consideration is the decaying scenario: the domain is loaded with a density proﬁle and
density ﬂuctuations, and the system is allowed to relax. Proﬁle maintenance is restricted to a sink term on the right
hand side of each density equation,

The trace ions start solely with their proﬁle. The initial electrostatic potential is then given by Eq. (10).

The initial evolution is the excitation of “Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter” proﬁle modes, especially the global Alfv´en oscillation.
This is caused by the fact that the initial equilibrium is only one-dimensional while the actual one is two-dimensional,
including Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter currents and ﬂows. It involves the “sideband modes” given by

. When these sideband modes reach dissipative equilibrium, the Pﬁrsch-Schl¨uter
resistive dissipation, C
current is established. Over about the same time interval, 0 < t < 200, the basic nonlinear drift wave mode structure
is set up [16, 17, 23]. Parallel sound wave dynamics, the geodesic acoustic sideband dynamics, and the zonal ﬂows
all reach statistical equilibrium by about t = 1500 [24]. For typical edge parameters the proﬁle decay (i.e., transport)
time scale is comparable to this, so we are dealing with a slowly transient case. However, it does provide a useful
control against the eﬀects of proﬁle maintenance (driving of the densities using a source) upon the turbulence.

deuterium as the main ion species and tritium as the trace species, with τt = 1 and µt = 1.5 and MD/me = 3670,
and either at = 0 (strict test particles) or at = 0.1 (minority species).

ne may be quantiﬁed by their cross correlation and phase shift distributions. These are
more usually employed to evaluate the relation between

shift distribution peaked near zero. A “hydrodynamic” relationship, the one expected of passive scalar advection in
a neutral ﬂuid, is characterised by a very weak or zero cross correlation and a wide phase shift distribution centred
upon π/2, the value which gives energetically maximum gradient drive. The ﬁelds in question are sampled on the

The expected form for a passive scalar quantity completely uncoupled to the potential would be hydrodynamic,
with random phase shifts in a case with no gradient. By contrast, although in the dynamical equations there is no
direct coupling between
nt, they are very closely correlated and their phase shift distribution is narrow and
peaked at zero for every nonzero ky in the spectrum. Taking the two combinations from this ﬁgure together, we ﬁnd
that the electron and trace ion density ﬂuctuations track each other very closely, despite the fact that the electrons
themselves are not in a passive advection relationship to the ExB eddies. This is the phenomenon we refer to as
“dynamical alignment” and the center of the phase shift distribution (essentially zero) and the value of the overall
cross correlation (larger than 0.9) give it a quantitative basis.

cross correlation values for at = 0.1 given by 0.763 for
ne, respectively. Cases with
ne and
ˆβ = 5 with at = 0 and 0.1 were also run, looking for changes closer to the MHD regime in which the mode structure
should be more hydrodynamic. The basic mode structure shows the changes resulting from the stronger role of the

vortices at kyρs = 0.05 to 0.1 (convective cell modes on the scale of L⊥), which in the ky-spectra sit higher above the
broadband drift wave turbulence and show much larger phase shifts. Nevertheless, the same closeness of

found. The cross correlation and phase shift information as in the nominal case are shown in Fig. 7 for the case with
ˆβ = 5 and at = 0.1. The fact that this case is in the MHD regime is shown by the hydrodynamic relationship between
ne and
φ; the overall cross correlation value is −0.0259. The persistence of the dynamical alignment is shown by the
relationship between

adiabatic and hydrodynamic limits, in the Section after that.

IV. GEM3 RESULTS FOR DRIVEN CASES

We now turn to cases in which the proﬁles are maintained by sources so that the runs may be carried for arbitrary

time. The setup is exactly as for the decaying cases, with the addition of the drive term

for each density variable. Typically we use Si = Se so as not to drive vorticity on the inner boundary. The basic
proﬁle source term has the shape of a Gaussian with 1/e-width 0.3Lx centred upon x = −Lx/2 and a time constant
chosen to anticipate the transport time scale. Narrower main source proﬁles (width 0.1Lx) with correspondingly
larger coeﬃcients (i.e., at constant total source) were found to excessively excite artiﬁcial MHD modes. The trace ion
source was centred upon x = 0 to set up a gradient region for x > 0 and to look for a pinch (ﬁnite gradient with no
interior source) in the x < 0 region, so nt0 was used as a template. The source terms were chosen as

for electrons, main ions, and trace ions, respectively. The parameters se and st are free; nominally they are both set
to 10−3.

The standard case is the same as the one from the previous Section, with at = 0, so that the trace ions are proper
test particles. The same time traces are shown in Fig. 8, which can be compared to Fig. 1. The amplitudes and
transport, in the left hand frame, show that the dynamics is well saturated after t = 1000, so that late time averaged
diagnostics are taken over the interval 1000 < t < 2000. The time traces of the ExB and magnetic energies, labelled
Ee and EB, respectively, are shown in the right hand frame, indicating that the global Alfv´en oscillation damps away
well before the saturated stage. The short time scale visible in the Ap signal is indicative of the geodesic acoustic
oscillation. The long time scale oscillation from the decaying case is absent in this ﬁgure, showing that it is a response
to the overall proﬁle decay in the other case.

The evolution of the proﬁles of the electron and trace densities in this driven case is shown in Figs. 9 and 10,
measured the same way as in Figs. 2 and 3, for the decaying case. In these units, the maximal initial value is unity,
and the ﬁrst frame at t = 10 shows that the turbulence is already deconstructing the initial proﬁle of
nt. Up until
t = 100 the evolution is the same as in the decaying case. The trace species distribution spreads until the value at the
left boundary (x = −32 in units of ρs) is as large as that at the source (x = 0). Transport equilibration, the temporal

convergence of these proﬁles, sets in after t = 1000. At late times, the proﬁles of
source regions. The ﬂatness of
nt for x < 0 is indicative of the absence of an impurity pinch. For this we note however
that temperature disturbance and gradient dynamics is not followed, so there remains the possibility of an impurity
pinch driven by the ion temperature gradient. Nevertheless, the background temperatures of the three species are
equal, so this does show that the existence of warm ions does not by itself lead to an impurity pinch nor does the
trace and main ion temperature lead to a “neoclassical” pinch, the underlying dynamics of which would indeed be
contained in this model (geodesic curvature acting on the gradients through diamagnetic ﬂuxes, and the interaction
of this with parallel ﬂows in the axisymmetric part of the dynamics).

tokamak edge values of L⊥/cs is already very short). The second pair show that the presence of the source just to the
left of the measured region does not aﬀect the dynamical alignment result (overall cross correlation: 0.920), as can be
judged by comparing with Fig. 6. But if this is measured over the whole radial domain, then the eﬀect of not only
the source but also the region interior to it is found to be large. So the conclusion of dynamical alignment between
these two disturbance ﬁelds does depend on the relative strength of the nonlinear dynamics.

Having now determined that the three dimensional model recovers the same basic result in source free gradient
regions, whether or not it is driven or allowed to decay, we now turn to the simplest two dimensional dissipative drift
wave model for further comparison.

V. RESULTS IN A SIMPLE 2D DRIFT WAVE MODEL

The dissipative coupling parameter D serves as a model for the adiabatic response. The hydrodynamic and adiabatic
limits are D → 0 and D → ∞, respectively. For D = 0 the electrons and test particles have the same equation.
For D > 1 they are obviously very diﬀerent. A simple interchange curvature model with K = ωB∂/∂y and a long-
wave damping coeﬃcient νd are included to study saturated interchange turbulence. Note that this model uses the
traditional “gyro-Bohm” local normalisation, with the factor of δ folded into the amplitudes.

For the purposes of this test series, the zonal ﬂow question is avoided by setting temporal changes to the ky = 0
component of
Ω to zero. The Colella [33]/Van Leer[34] MUSCL scheme is applied to d/dt as in previous versions
of the 3D electromagnetic gyroﬂuid model[22] (the linear drive terms are combined into this, e.g., by deﬁning N =
ne + ne). The terms involving D are done via the implicit scheme of previous 2D drift wave models [35]. In this, D
is applied only to the ky 6= 0 components. The background proﬁles are chosen diﬀerently, with ∂ne/∂x = −1 and
f are driven diﬀerently regardless of the value of the gradient parameter ωz.

were taken to t = 1000 with the interval 400 < t < 1000 as the saturated stage.

The variations for the drift wave cases with ωB = νd = 0 were

D = {0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1., 3.} with nominal K and ωz, K = {0.025, 0.05, 0.1} at D = 0.01 and nominal
ωz, and ωz = {0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.} at nominal D and K. The cases with D = 0.001 and 0.003 did not saturate, as thin
radial ﬂow jets formed and simply grew, so another scan with D = {0.001, 0.003, 0.01} was done at K = 0.025 and
nominal ωz. In all cases in which saturation was found, the cross correlation between
ne was larger than 0.85.
This is due to the nature of the turbulence in this model: at low D the spectrum migrates to large enough scale that
D can compete with k2
⊥ω, with ω close to the diamagnetic value of ky, thereby guaranteeing strong adiabatic coupling
for the long-wave side of the energy containing range. At high D, with all energetic transfer phenomena becoming
weak at large scale, the turbulence again migrated there, and with the weak nonlinearities the cases for D > 1 are
strongly adiabatic with most of the energy again at long wavelength; the D = 3.0 case was taken to t = 4000 with
the saturation stage taken as the 2000 < t < 4000 interval. All of this has been the subject of previous study [11, 20].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

A set of three dimensional computations of turbulence in an electromagnetic drift wave regime commensurate with
tokamak edge turbulence of a fully self consistent, two-component plasma has been given. The principal focus has
been on the second ion species as a proper test species, namely, with no back reaction on the polarisation, as controlled
by a background charge density parameter nominally set to zero. Variation of this parameter was found to produce
negligible changes. Both decaying and source driven cases were considered. This diﬀerence also produced no diﬀerence
in turbulence regime, though with the sources present the turbulence and transport were able to fully saturate, leaving
more activity at very small scale at late times. A set of two dimensional computations within a dissipative drift wave
model with a test species continuity equation was also given as a control case. The numerical schemes and boundary
conditions in the 2D and 3D models were diﬀerent. Nevertheless, the same conclusion with regard to the correlation
of the test ion species was always the same: the test ion and electron densities were found to be correlated to much
better than 80 percent in all cases, and better than 90 percent in most, as measured outside the source region in the
3D driven cases.

It is important to note that the relationship between the electron density itself and the electrostatic potential (the
stream function for the ExB eddies) was itself quite diﬀerent among some of these cases. The adiabatic response of the
potential back to the electrons is parameter dependent, with the electrons usually not in a test particle relationship
vis-a-vis the eddies. Nevertheless, so long as there is a signiﬁcant nonadiabatic electron density response, the test
particle transport was found to conform to whatever the electron transport result was.

Indeed, these result suggest that the character of the adiabatic response is not the electrons following the potential,
but the other way around: the potential pushes all species similarly through ExB advection, but the form of its
disturbances and hence the ExB eddies follows that of the electron pressure disturbances due to the adiabatic response.
The similarity of transport of all species regardless of fractional composition now becomes an expected result, since
the ExB advection is the most robust eﬀect in any of the continuity equations. The adiabatic response is therefore
mostly a matter of the parallel current mediating the dynamics of polarisation.

There is an important experimental implication in this: Experiments are underway to measure the transport of
trace tritium ions in tokamaks [5]. Transport of the trace ions is to be compared to that of the electrons. It is very
important to note that if the two transports are found to have the same character, it does not follow that the electrons
themselves transport like test particles, namely, that they should follow a random walk process. The existence of
adiabatic coupling makes the electron transport diﬀerent from this. The results in this work show that the potential
ﬁnding that trace ion transport would be similar to the electron transport does not by itself give an indication of the
character of the electron transport itself.

It remains to establish what these dynamical relationships become in a regime where the passing electrons are
completely adiabatic, and particle transport is solely due to trapped electrons, and thermal transport is mostly due to
the ions, through the standard ITG scenario which receives most current attention [15]. Moreover, the question of an
impurity driven particle pinch remains open, since the actual temperature ﬂuctuation and gradient dynamics is not
included in the GEM3 model. Future manifestations of this work will address these questions with a more detailed
model [25] designed to treat them in either edge or core plasma regimes.

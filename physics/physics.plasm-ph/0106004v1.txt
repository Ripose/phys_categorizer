states. The main result of the experiment is that the formation of localized states essentially

depends on the relative balance of ﬂuid dilation energy, repulsive electron–atom interaction energy,

and thermal energy. As a consequence, the onset of localization depends on the medium disorder

through gas temperature and density. It appears that the transition from delocalized to localized

states shifts to larger densities as the temperature is increased. This behavior can be understood

in terms of a simple model of electron self–trapping in a spherically symmetric square well.

INTRODUCTION

The transport properties of excess electrons in dense noble gases and liquids give useful

information on the electron states in a disordered medium and on the relationship between

the electron–atom interaction and the properties of the ﬂuid. The electron behavior depends

on the strength of its coupling with the gas atoms and on the response function of the gas

itself. Therefore, diﬀerent transport mechanisms and regimes can be obtained according to

the nature of the electron–atom interaction (repulsive or attractive), to the thermodynamic

conditions of the gas, either close to or removed from its critical point, and to the amount

of disorder inherent to the ﬂuid [1].

Typically, at low density and high temperature, electrons are quasifree. Their wavefunc-

tion is pretty delocalized and the resulting mobility is large. They scatter elastically oﬀ the

atoms of noble gases in a series of binary collisions and the scattering process is basically

determined by the interaction potential through the electron–atom scattering cross section.

The mobility can be predicted accurately by the classical kinetic theory [2].

At higher densities, and, possibly, at lower temperatures, electrons may either remain

quasifree with large mobility (as in the case of Argon), or they can give origin to a new type

of state that is spatially localized inside a dilation of the ﬂuid. In this case the mobility is

very low because the complex electron plus ﬂuid dilation moves as an unique, massive entity.

This, for instance, happens in He and Ne. The main diﬀerence between the two cases is that

in the former the electron–atom interaction is attractive (Ar) and in the latter is repulsive

(He and Ne) [3, 4].

The simplest model to describe the behavior of electrons in a dense, disordered medium

is the hard–sphere gas and a practical realization of this system is represented by He. In

He the electron–atom interaction is pretty well described by a hard–core potential and the

scattering cross section is fairly large and energy independent. It is well known that the

charge transport proceeds via bubble formation in liquid He at low temperature [5, 6, 7, 8].

In gaseous He at low temperature the mobility shows a drop of several orders of magnitude

when the density is increased from low to medium values. This drop has been intepreted

in terms of a continuous transition from a transport regime where the excess electrons are

quasifree to a region where they are localized. There is still controversy about the nature

of the localized states, whether they are localized in bubbles as in the case of the liquid or

2

whether they are localized in the Anderson sense [9]. In this case the electron wavefunction

decays exponentially with the distance owing to multiple scattering eﬀects induced by the

disorder of the medium [10].

Owing to these considerations, it is interesting to investigate the localization transition

at higher temperatures. Therefore, we have measured the mobility of excess electrons in

dense He gas at temperatures 26 < T < 77 K. By assuming that electrons are localized in

dilations of the gas, a simple quantum mechanical model provides a good semiquantitative

description of the observed behavior of the mobility.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The mobility measurements have been carried out by using a swarm technique in a Pulsed

Townsend Photoinjection apparatus we have been exploiting for a long time for electron and

ion mobility measurements [11, 12, 13]. A schematics of the apparatus is shown in Figure 1.

Brieﬂy, a high-pressure cell (CN), that can withstand pressures up to 10 MPa, is mounted on

the cold head of a cryocooler inside a triple-shield thermostat. The cell is operated between

25 and 330 K. Temperature is stabilized within 0.01 K.

A parallel-plate capacitor, consisting of an emitter (E) and a collector (C), is contained in

the high-pressure cell and is energized by the high-voltage generator -V. A digital voltmeter

(DV) reads the voltage. The distance between the two plates delimits the drift space. An

electron swarm is produced by irradiating the gold-coated quartz window placed in the

emitter with the VUV light pulse of a Xe ﬂashlamp (FL). The amount of produced charge

ranges between 4 and 400 fC, depending on the gas pressure and on the applied electrical

ﬁeld strength. Under its action, the charges drift towards the anode inducing a current in the

external circuit. The current is integrated by the analog circuit RC in order to improve the

signal-to-noise ratio. Two diﬀerent operational ampliﬁers (SA and FA) are used depending

on the duration of the signal. This is recorded by a high-speed digital transient analyzer

(DS) and is fetched by a personal computer for the analysis of the waveform.

Ultra-high purity He gas with an impurity content, essentially Oxygen, of some p.p.m is

used. The impurity content is reduced to a few p.p.b. by circulating the gas in a recirculation

loop driven by a home-made bellow circulator (BC) that forces the gas to be puriﬁed through

an Oxisorb cartridge (OX) and a LN2-cooled active-charcoal trap (CT).

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In Figure 2 we show the observed zero–ﬁeld mobility µ0 in He at T

26 K. The present

≈

data are compared with literature data for T = 4.2 K [5, 6, 7] and for T = 20.3 K [8].

At T = 26 K µ0 exhibits the same qualitative behavior observed earlier at much lower

temperatures. As the gas density increases, µ0 decreases by nearly 5 orders of magnitude.

The continuous transition from the low–density high–mobility region is interpreted as the

progressive depletion of extended or delocalized states and the consequent formation of

localized states [9, 14]. These are assumed to consist of an electron trapped into a cavity

in the ﬂuid. This cavity is referred to as an electronic bubble. A similar physical process

has been observed also in liquid [15] and gaseous Neon [12]. In gaseous Neon, the µ0 data

resemble closely those shown in Figure 2 and the interpretation of the Neon data, as due

to electron localization in cavities, has been conﬁrmed by quantum–mechanical Molecular

Dynamics calculations [16].

The dynamics of the localization process, though not investigated experimentally, is quite

clear [17, 18, 19]. However, even if the localization process were of the Anderson type [9],

i.e., electrons with energy below the mobility edge trapped as a consequence of the self–

interference of their wavefunction because of the medium disorder, nonetheless electrons wind

up by forming electron bubbles because of the repulsive electron–medium interaction and

medium compliance. The existence of such bubbles has been also conﬁrmed experimentally

by infrared absorption spectra in liquid He [20, 21].

Once all of the electron states are localized, the resulting µ0 is not zero because the

gas is compliant enough to allow the large complex structure made of an electron plus the

associated bubble to diﬀuse slowly [1] and drift under the action of an external electric ﬁeld..

The main diﬀerence between the present data and those at lower temperatures is that

the transition to low mobility states is shifted to larger values of the density. At T = 4.2 K

It is evident that the formation of localized states is not related to the presence of a nearby

5.2 K). It rather seems related to the

Therefore, it appears reasonable that the localization transition shifts at larger densities for

higher temperatures in order to achieve increasingly larger free energies.

The localization transition can be noticed also by observing the electric ﬁeld dependence

of the mobility.

In Figure 3 we plot the density–normalized mobility µN as a function

of the reduced ﬁeld E/N at T = 34.5 K for several densities. The behavior at diﬀerent

temperatures is similar to this one.

At small N and low E/N, electrons are in near thermal equilibrium with the gas atoms
and µN is constant. As E/N increases, µN decreases, eventually reaching the (E/N)−1/2

dependence expected on the basis of the classical kinetic theory because the scattering rate

increases with the electron kinetic energy [2].

At high N, µN is very low and practically independent of E/N, at least for the highest

electric ﬁelds of the present experiment (up to

7 kV /cm). At such densities, almost all

≈

of the electrons are localized in bubbles. Even the highest electric ﬁeld reached in the

experiment is not large enough to heat up such massive objects. The electronic bubbles

therefore remain in equilibrium with the gas atoms.

At intermediate values of N, the behavior of µN is quite complicated. At small E/N, µN

is constant, while at larger E/N, µN reaches a maximum and ﬁnally, at even larger E/N, it
meets the classical (E/N)−1/2 behavior. The same superlinear behavior of the drift velocity

of electrons in dense He gas was observed also at very low temperatures [7].

This behavior can be interpreted in terms of the formation, at large N, of electron states

which are self–trapped in partially ﬁlled bubbles. These are very massive and have low

mobility. By increasing the electric ﬁeld strength bubbles may be either destroyed or their

formation may be inhibited, so that electrons are again free and very mobile. The same

behavior of µN as a function of E/N has been observed also in Neon gas and the same

interpretation of the data has proven successful [12]. In Figure 4, the zero–ﬁeld value µ0 of

the mobility µ is shown as a function of the density N for the investigated temperatures. In

this Figure the shift of the localization transition to larger N for increasing T is clearly shown.

5

For T > 45 K the transition has not been tracked down completely because the pressure

required to reach such large N values exceeds the capacity of our apparatus (P

10.0 MP a.)

≤

Nonetheless, it is evident that the localization phenomenon occurs also at high temperatures

provided that the density is large enough.

IV. DISCUSSION

A description of the observed behavior of µ0N as a function of N is very diﬃcult. In fact,

it must deal with the mobility of the two charge carriers, the extended and the localized

electron, and also it must treat correctly the probability of occupation of the two states as

a function of the density.

Moreover, although the mobility of the localized electron, i.e., of the bubble, is rather

well described by the simple Stokes hydrodynamic formula, µ0 = e/6πηR, where η is the gas

viscosity and R is the bubble radius [14, 23], the description of the mobility of the extended

electron states is still rather controversial, also because the localization transition is not as

sharp as desired, as, for instance, in the case of Ne [12].

Several theoretical models for the description of the quasifree electron mobility in dense

noble gases have been devised on the basis of the Boltzmann formalism of kinetic theory

[3, 9, 10]. Their common feature is the realization that multiple scattering eﬀects concur

to dress the electron–atom scattering cross section.

It has also been suggested [24] that,

when the ratio between the electron thermal wavelength λT and its mean free path ℓc is
λT /ℓc ≈
the interference of two scattering processes: the scattering oﬀ several diﬀerent scattering

1, the scattering rate diverges [9] and electrons get localized as a consequence of

centers and the time–reversed scattering sequence [25]. This model naturally introduces a

mobility edge, an energy below which the electron wavefunction does not propagate.

Although this mobility–edge model describes well the electron mobility in dense He gas,

it has two main drawbacks. The ﬁrst one is that it works correctly only for He, because

its scattering cross section is large and nearly energy independent. For Ne, for instance, it

does not correctly describe the experimental data because of the strong dependence of the

momentum transfer scattering cross section [26].

Moreover, it is well known that, in liquid He, electrons trapped in stable cavities within

the ﬂuid have been observed by IR spectroscopy [1, 20, 21] and this observation has been

6

conﬁrmed also by quantum–mechanical Molecular Dynamics calculations [22], while the lo-

calized states, described in the mobility–edge model as those with energy below the mobility

edge, are only not propagating but do not reside in cavities. Even a static disorder produces

localized electrons in this model.

It is of course possible that after localization electrons

could deform the ﬂuid to produce bubble states, but the observed drop of mobility is not

due to bubble formation [9].

In view of these considerations, we adopt a simple model [27] that describes the formation

of the self–trapped electron states as a process of localization in a quantum well. The

mobility of the quasifree electrons is treated in terms of a diﬀerent, heuristic model developed

in our laboratory that encompasses the several multiple scattering eﬀects present in the

scattering process of an excess electron in a dense gas. We use such a model because it has

given excellent agreement with the experimental data in Ne [11, 12] as well as in Ar [28].

In addition to the usual thermal energy, electrons in the propagating state have a ground

state energy V0(N) which depends on the density of the environment. V0(N) consists of two

contributions [29]

V0(N) = EK(N) + UP (N)

(1)

UP is a negative potential energy term arising from the screened polarization interaction

of electrons with the gas atoms. EK(N) is a positive kinetic energy contribution due to

excluded volume, quantum eﬀects.

Owing to the small He polarizability, UP can be neglected thus yielding V0 ≈

as shown in Figure 5. In Eq. 2, rs = (3/4πN)1/3 is the Wigner–Seitz radius, ˜a is the electron-

atom scattering length, and k0 is the ground state momentum of the electron. Owing to

the fact that the electron–atom interaction is essentially repulsive, V0(N) is positive and

increase monotonically with N. This means that the lower is the gas density the lower is the

ground state energy of a quasifree electron.

Since thermally activated ﬂuctuations of the density are present, also V0 ﬂuctuates and

electrons can get temporarily localized in a virtual or resonant state above one such density

ﬂuctuation where the local density is lower than the average one [1, 31].

7

If the electron–atom interaction is strongly enough repulsive (as in the case of He) and if

the ﬂuctuation is suﬃciently deep, there can be formation of a self–trapped electron state,

whose stability can be determined by minimizing its free energy with respect to the quasifree

state.

We therefore assume that localized electron resides in a quantum square well of spherical

Since the gas has no surface tension and since the temperature is pretty high for He atoms

to have signiﬁcant thermal energy, we must allow for some He atoms penetrating into the

cavity and dynamically interchanging with outside atoms. We thus assume the bubble to

be partially ﬁlled with density Ni < N and ﬁlling fraction F = Ni/N. The electron is thus

In Figure 12 we show the results of the model for T = 26 K. The quasifree mobility in the

low–density side is well described by the heuristic model and also the density where the

localization transition occurs is reproduced with satisfactory accuracy. Similar results are

obtained for the higher temperatures.

This Figure clearly shows that the present model quite accurately predicts the shift of the

localization transition to higher densities when the temperature is increased, although it

does not ﬁt the data with great accuracy.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The electron mobility in dense He gas shows two distinct regimes at low and high N.

At low N the states of the excess electrons are extended, while at high N electrons are

localized in bubbles. Both states are present at all N, but bubble states become stable, at

ﬁxed T, only if N exceeds a certain value N ⋆. The measured mobility is a weighted sum of

the contribution of the two kind of electrons, quasifree and localized.

A simple model of electron localization in a quantum square well explains the observed

fact that the localization transition shifts to higher N as T increases. It also semiquantita-

tively describes the observed mobility. The agreement of the model with the data, however,

is far from satisfactory. More sophisticated models, namely those based on the so–called

self–consistent–ﬁeld approximation [14, 36], where the density proﬁle of the bubble is self–

consistently calculated along with the electron wavefunction, can be used with results not

very diﬀerent from the present ones.

Among possible reasons to explain the discrepancy of the present model with the exper-

imental data, there could be the fact that the bubble model is a simple two–state model

and neglects the possibility that bubbles have a distribution of radii and ﬁlling fractions.

Moreover, even the description of mobility of the quasifree electrons is not yet completely

satisfactory.

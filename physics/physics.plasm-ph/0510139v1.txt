Is a Plasma Diamagnetic?

W. Engelhardt1

Max-Planck-Institut f¨ur Plasmaphysik, IPP-Euratom Association2, Garching, Germany

Abstract
Classical plasmas in thermodynamic equilibrium should be neither para- nor diamagnetic due to the
action of the Lorentz force. Magnetic conﬁnement, however, is based on the observed diamagnetism
of laboratory plasmas. The apparent paradox is investigated on the basis of the resistive magneto-
hydrodynamic equations. It is found that, at least in simple plasma conﬁgurations, these equations
do not permit a solution, i. e. the paradox cannot be resolved. It seems that the Lorentz force is
a test-particle approximation which is not suitable to describe the interaction of moving particles in
agreement with the conservation of energy.

R´esum´e
Les plasmas classiques en ´equilibre thermodynamique ne devraient ˆetre ni para- ni diamagn´etiques
`a cause de l’action de la force de Lorentz. Pourtant le conﬁnement magn´etique des plasmas en labo-
ratoire est fond´e sur leur diamagn´etisme observ´e. Le paradoxe est explor´e sur la base des ´equations
de la th´eorie magn´eto-hydrodynamique r´esistive. On trouve que ces ´equations ne permettent pas une
solution unique, en tout cas pour des conﬁgurations simples; c’est `a dire qu’il n’est pas possible de
r´esoudre le paradoxe. Il semble que la force de Lorentz repr´esente seulement une approximation pour
des particules singuli`eres. Si l’on veut observer la conservation d’´energie, il faut admettre que cette
force n’est pas appropri´ee pour d´ecrire exactement l’interaction des particules en mouvement.

I Introduction
Feynman claims in his lectures [1] that both dia- and paramagnetism are exclusively quantum me-
chanical eﬀects. His argument is of a very general nature: Since the classical Lorentz force is per-
pendicular to the velocity of a charged particle, the energy m v2
2 of the particle does not depend
on the magnetic ﬁeld. Two boxes with the same number of particles and the same temperature must
consequently contain the same energy even if one of the boxes is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld. If the
particles would alter the magnetic ﬁeld, for example diamagnetically, the magnetic ﬁeld energy would

Gesellschaft.

change and the total energy could not be the same. For this reason neither para- nor diamagnetism
can arise as long as it is only the Lorentz force which acts upon the particles.

On the other hand, hot fusion plasmas are governed by the Lorentz force alone, since quantum-
mechanical eﬀects are negligible. Because of the rotational direction of the gyrating particles these
plasmas behave clearly diamagnetically which is the reason why they can be conﬁned by magnetic
ﬁelds. In tokamaks, for example, one observes magnetic ﬁeld changes, when the conﬁned plasma is
heated by external sources. The change of the toroidal magnetic ﬂux is regularly monitored with a so
called ‘diamagnetic loop’ [2]. It allows to determine the energy content of the plasma [3] and yields
information that can be utilized to control the position of the plasma in the vacuum vessel [4].

It has been pointed out that an ideally conﬁned plasma is not in any contact with material walls
and, therefore, not in complete thermodynamic equilibrium. This seems to explain why diamagnetism
may occur classically in special circumstances. A. Schl¨uter [5] quoting N. Bohr shows how the
diamagnetism disappears in a plasma which is placed in a homogeneous ﬁeld and surrounded by
reﬂecting walls (Fig. 1).

B

Figure 1 Gyration of particles in a box with reﬂecting walls (homogeneous ﬁeld)

Each gyrating particle constitutes a magnetic moment which by superposition would result in a
magnetic ﬁeld opposing the external ﬁeld (diamagnetism). There is, however, an additional opposite
magnetic moment created by the particles which are reﬂected at the walls such that the net eﬀect is
zero. This example conﬁrms Feynman’s conjecture, but it is not a generally valid demonstration.

A counter-example may be produced by considering an inhomogeneous ﬁeld: A straight wire

carries a current and is surrounded by a toroidal vessel containing a plasma (Fig. 2).

grad B

In this case – in addition to the magnetic moment of the gyrating particles – we have also a current
density in the plasma volume parallel to the external current which is due to the particle drift in the
inhomogeneous ﬁeld. This current will alter the externally applied ﬁeld so that the ﬁeld energy is
changed by the presence of the particles. As a consequence the energetic state depends on whether the
vessel is being placed in the inhomogeneous ﬁeld or not, in contrast to Feynman’s general conclusion.
In this paper we analyze the apparent paradox by applying the ideal and resistive magneto-
hydrodynamic (mhd) equations to simple plasma conﬁgurations, but we ﬁnd ourselves unable to
remove the contradiction. It turns out that there is an intrinsic inconsistency between Lorentz force,
Maxwell’s equations, and energy conservation. This leads us to the conclusion that the Lorentz
force is a test-particle approximation which ignores the back-reaction on the ﬁeld-producing magnet.
In most instances this is justiﬁed to a high degree of accuracy, as the test-particle interacts with
typically 1023 ﬁeld-producing particles. When it comes to a plasma, however, the ﬁeld produced by
the gyrating particles cannot be neglected any longer and the Lorentz force turns out to be insuﬃcient
to describe the interaction of the particles in motion.

II The Resistive and Ideal Magneto-Hydrodynamic Model of a Plasma
The mhd-equations are derived from the Boltzmann-equation applied to an ionized gas which is
subject to the action of the Lorentz force. Derivations are found in many text-books. Quoting from
[6] we have from the momentum balance of electrons and ions in a fully ionized hydrogen plasma:

and the equation for the internal energy:

p div ~v = S + η~j2

with p = n (Ti + Te) and f = 3 for a plasma with three degrees of freedom. S is a power density
which is added to the plasma, e.g., by electromagnetic radiation. Equation (6) does not contain the
magnetic ﬁeld which is a consequence of the Lorentz force acting presumably on the particles. Apart
from the Joule heating term the equation is the same as the one for an ideal gas in the absence of a
magnetic ﬁeld.

If the electron temperature is suﬃciently high, the terms in (2) and (6) containing the resistivity
η, which accounts for the momentum exchange between electrons and ions, may be dropped. The
resulting system of equations is the model of ideal mhd being valid on a time-scale short compared
to the electron-ion collision time.

III A Linear Theta-Pinch Heated by Radiation
We apply the ideal mhd-equations with η = 0 to a linear Theta-Pinch in equilibrium, the external
ﬁeld of which is produced by a superconducting coil (Fig. 3).

We assume that at time t = 0 the plasma is heated by switching on a radiation source so that the
pressure is increased. Because of (7) the magnetic ﬁeld must change and the plasma radius a deﬁned
by p (a) = 0 may be displaced. As long as the radiation source is suﬃciently weak, the kinetic energy
of the plasma motion is negligible compared to the thermal energy and (7) still holds during the
expansion of the plasma. The total magnetic ﬂux inside the coil remains unchanged because of (4)
as the electric ﬁeld vanishes at the surface of the superconductor:

We insert (2) into (4):

where v denotes the radial component of the plasma velocity, and integrate from 0 to a. Together
with (8) we obtain an equation for the change of the external ﬁeld due to the expansion velocity of

The task is now to solve (11) with the velocity as given by (12) inside a moving boundary as described
by (10) and (14). The boundary conditions are:

[∂p/∂r]r=0 = 0 ,

p (a) = 0 ,

v (0) = 0.

As initial condition we may choose an arbitrary pressure proﬁle p (r, 0). If p (a) = 0 is to hold at all
times, we must require that the heating source S vanishes at the plasma boundary. For the sake of
simplicity we choose

S (r, t) = α p (r, t)

By solving the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations (22) we obtain a relationship between u, β,

(19) in order to express u and β as functions of x and τ by further integration.

It turns out, however, that the solution of (22) does not satisfy the boundary conditions (20) in
general. In order to demonstrate this we choose for simplicity the special case δ = 0 corresponding to
f = 2. It will become obvious that the diﬃculty remains in the more physical case f = 3 . As an initial

Integration with respect to time yields:

Elimination of the slope of β at the boundary from (30) and (28) yields a diﬀerential equation for g:

from which g (τ ) may be determined.

(20):

If we insert, however, (31) into (19) and integrate from the axis to the boundary we ﬁnd with

Obviously, this integral equation is only satisﬁed at τ = 0. At later times β evolves according to (18)
from the initial proﬁle to β (x,

1, so that (32) cannot hold at all times.

In view of this result we come to the conclusion that the set of equations (1 - 6) has no solution
in general which would satisfy the boundary conditions. As the problem of heating a Theta-Pinch
plasma in equilibrium is physically well posed, it must have a solution in reality. Evidently nature
“uses equations” which are diﬀerent from those formulated in (1 - 6).

IV A Slowly Diﬀusing Theta-Pinch Equilibrium
Inclusion of ﬁnite resistivity removes the conservation of ﬂux inside the plasma, but it does not remedy
the situation. Starting from an equilibrium (7) with a function p (r) the plasma should slowly diﬀuse
and ultimately ﬁll the entire volume inside the coil. Spitzer [6] gives an expression for the diﬀusion
velocity:

−
which is easily derived from (1) and (2) under the assumption of the magnetic ﬁeld staying constant
in time. He rightly remarks that this condition is only satisﬁed in the test-particle approximation
µ0 p
0, but, nevertheless, he claims one paragraph below that (33) is of general validity re-
stricted only by the exclusion of inertial terms.

Let us assume that there is no heating source S, but ﬁeld energy is dissipated into internal energy
by the diﬀusion process. Equation (8) remains unchanged as long as the plasma diﬀusion occurs
inside a superconducting coil. We derive the total power balance by taking the scalar product of (2)
with ~j and by eliminating the triple product with (1):

as the surface integrals arising from the divergence terms vanish. For simplicity we have omitted the
term with the kinetic energy mi n v2
2 as the diﬀusion velocity is very small compared to the thermal
speed. Furthermore, in accordance with (3) we have neglected the electrostatic ﬁeld energy arising
through the electric ﬁeld component Er = (∂pi/∂r)/e n, which provides the conﬁnement of the ions.
This contribution is negligibly small in laboratory plasmas compared to thermal and magnetic ﬁeld
energy. The heating term η ~j2 does not appear in (37) explicitly. The increase in internal energy
must come from a decrease of the ﬁeld energy as the system is energetically closed by the condition
~E = 0 at the superconducting surface.

The solutions for the pressure and the internal magnetic ﬁeld must satisfy the force balance (7). We

of a ﬁnite pressure which is not included in (33):

Now the characteristic systems (44) and (45) may be integrated. The four resulting families of
characteristics must lie entirely in the surface p (x, t). This is, however, not possible, unless at least
uS (x, t) = 0 which is excluded at ﬁnite resistivity.

The so called ‘slowly diﬀusing equilibrium’, which is intuitively expected in the case of ﬁnite
resistivity, is not obtainable from the resistive mhd-equations when the pressure dependent term
omitted by Spitzer in (33) is included. Only in the test-particle case µ0 p
0 an approximate
diﬀusion velocity may be obtained from (33) at constant magnetic ﬁeld. In general, the momentum
balance (1, 2) and the power balance (6) are inconsistent in conjunction with Maxwell’s equations (3,
4). Again, we must conclude that nature uses a diﬀerent set of equations or, more properly speaking,
at least one of the laws of nature as codiﬁed in (1 - 6) must be incomplete. It should be noted that
the discrepancy encountered cannot be resolved by inclusion of heat conduction. Its dependence on
temperature is diﬀerent from that of the resistivity so that a cancellation of terms is generally not
possible.

V Discussion and Conclusion
The mathematical model of resistive mhd (1 - 6) is, of course, not an exact description of reality. It
leaves out not only a number of well known eﬀects such as heat conduction, viscosity, thermoelectricity,
gravity, but it neglects also the ﬁnite mass of electrons, the diﬀerence of electron and ion density, the
eﬀects of quantum mechanics etc. The idealizations involved are common practice in the mathematical
modelling of physical reality, but this should lead only to minor deviations of the predictions from the
observations on basic features. In hydrodynamics similar approximations are made, but the results
as derivable from the model equations are in reasonable agreement with observations.

In magneto-hydrodynamics the situation is diﬀerent according to our analysis: The mathematical
model does not permit a prediction in principle, as the equations are internally inconsistent and do not
yield unique solutions. This is not acceptable even for an idealized model and one must ﬁnd out the
reason. The derivation of the hierarchy of equations follows the same principles as in hydrodynamics
so that an inconsistency is not to be expected at ﬁrst sight. If it arises nevertheless, it must have to
do with an inconsistency in the basic interaction law between individual particles as it is described
by Lorentz force and Maxwell’s equations.

The validity of Maxwells equations has been suﬃciently conﬁrmed and cannot be put into doubt
in the present context. This is also true for the energy principle. The correctness of the Lorentz force,
when applied to individual particles, seems also to be suﬃciently veriﬁed. It is, however, practically
impossible in these experiments to measure the back-reaction of the orbiting particles on the ﬁeld
producing magnet. We can, therefore, not exclude that a term in the elementary force law, which
either cancels or is negligible in test-particle experiments, has escaped the attention. At least one
observation raises doubts:

The angular momentum vector of a negatively charged particle gyrating in a homogeneous ﬁeld
is parallel to the ﬁeld vector. If many particles in a circular conductor rotate in the same direction,
they form a current which produces a magnetic moment such that the total ﬁeld at the center of the

loop is decreased. In this case the conductor is unstable as it has a tendency to turn around an axis
which lies in its plane when a perturbation occurs. This indicates that the particles in the conductor
are in a higher energetic state than they would be, if the current of negative particles would ﬂow
opposite to their natural direction of gyration. It is, of course, well known that a current loop in a
magnetic ﬁeld has in addition to its self-energy an extra potential energy which is the negative scalar
product of its magnetic moment with the ﬁeld.

The Lorentz force, however, does not predict a diﬀerence in the energetic state of an individual
particle regardless whether it rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise in a magnetic ﬁeld. Suppose a
charged particle is attached at the periphery of a rotatable disk, similar to ‘Feynman’s paradox’ [1].
As the Lorentz force points towards or away from the axis of the disk, no extra work is necessary
to reverse the direction of rotation so that the particle’s energy – in contrast to the particles in a
current loop – is independent of the sense of rotation. In the Appendix we show explicitly how the
Lorentz force is at variance with the conservation of energy when a single particle interacts with a
superconducting magnet.

The comparison of a gyrating particle with a current loop seems to point to an inconsistency
which is probably at the root of the discrepancy which we have found when the Lorentz force is
applied to a plasma. Because of the large amount of particles involved, we need to know the correct
force law describing their interaction, not only a test-particle approximation in an external ﬁeld. The
back-reaction on the ﬁeld producing magnet, which, at suﬃciently high pressure, is the plasma itself,
cannot be neglected any longer.
If the Lorentz force would be complemented by a suitable term
making the energetic state of a particle dependent on whether it is in a magnetic ﬁeld or not, the
equation of the internal energy (6) would be altered and, hopefully, the discrepancy could be removed.

The ﬁrst term is the motor force acting on the particle via the mechanical ﬁxture, the second term
is the Lorentz force. The power balance is obtained by taking the scalar product of (A.1) with the

The superconductor cannot sustain an electric ﬁeld and must consequently compensate the applied

L is proportional to the radius b. The factor of proportionality depends on the cross-section of the

The work done by the motor is apparently independent of the direction of rotation. To achieve,
however, the same kinetic energy of the particle, more energy is necessary when there is no supercon-
ductor present. The additional term arising from the Lorentz force is independent of the magnetic
ﬁeld and vanishes proportional to b−3 because of (A.15).

The interaction energy Wps (A.12) which depends on the direction of rotation and on the magnetic
~B of a
ﬁeld is not accounted for in (A.18). It corresponds quantitatively to the potential energy
magnetic moment in a magnetic ﬁeld: The average current of the particle on its orbit multiplied with
the enclosed area is q a vϕ/2 =
and the magnetic ﬁeld at the position of the particle as obtainable
from ~B = rot ~A is µ0 I/2 b. One would expect that the motor must supply or gain this extra work,
but the Lorentz force does not allow for it.

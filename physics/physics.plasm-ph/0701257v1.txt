Abstract

We present a Mathematica notebook allowing for the symbolic calculation of the 3×3

dielectric tensor of a electron-beam plasma system in the ﬂuid approximation. Cal-

culation is detailed for a cold relativistic electron beam entering a cold magnetized

plasma, and for arbitrarily oriented wave vectors. We show how one can elaborate

on this example to account for temperatures, arbitrarily oriented magnetic ﬁeld or

a diﬀerent kind of plasma.

1 Introduction

The calculation of the dielectric tensor of a beam plasma system is a recurrent

problem in plasma physics. Many eﬀorts have been dedicated recently to such

issue because of the Fast Ignition Scenario for inertial thermonuclear fusion

[1,2]. According to this view, the Deuterium Tritium target is ﬁrst compressed

by means of some driver. Then, the compressed fuel is ignited by a relativistic

electron beam generated by a petawatt laser shot. Such scenario implies there-

fore the interaction of a relativistic electron beam with a plasma. This kind of

interaction, and its magnetized counterpart, is also relevant to astrophysics,

in particular when investigating the relativistic jets of microquasars [3], active

galactic nuclei [4], gamma ray burst production scenarios [5] or pulsar winds

[6]. Theoretical works on these subjects are usually focused on the instabilities

of the system. Although many of them demands a kinetic treatment to be fully

described, the ﬂuid equations can set some very relevant guidelines, especially

when the system is not too hot. Furthermore, it has been known for long

that in the relativistic regime, instabilities with arbitrarily orientated wave

vectors may be essential [7,8,9,10,11]. One can therefore ﬁgure out how some

reﬁned kinetic theory may lead to almost unsolvable calculations whereas the

ﬂuid formalism is still tractable. For example, a detailed description of the

collisional ﬁlamentation instability (k ⊥ beam) including the movement of

the background ions plasma, and accounting for temperatures, was ﬁrst per-

formed through the ﬂuid equations [12]. The very same equations were used

to explore the growth rate of unstable modes with arbitrarily oriented wave

vectors (with respect to the beam) when a relativistic electron beam enters

a plasma [7,9,10,11]. The results were found crucial as it was demonstrated

3

that the fastest growing modes were indeed found for obliquely propagating

waves, and the kinetic counterpart of these models has only been considered

very recently [13,14,15]. As far as the magnetized case is concerned, the kinetic

formalism has been thoroughly investigated for wave vectors parallel and nor-

mal to the beam [16,17,18]. But the unstable oblique modes, which once again

turn to be the most unstable in many cases, could only be explored through

the ﬂuid formalism [8].

It has been demonstrated that the ﬂuid equations yield the same ﬁrst order

temperature corrections than the kinetic theory for oblique modes, and the

roles of both beam and plasma parallel and perpendicular temperatures are

retrieved [19]. The ﬂuid approximation is thus deﬁnitely a tool of paramount

importance to deal with beam plasma instabilities. Additionally, it generally

yields a polynomial dispersion equation for which numerical resolution is im-

mediate. Nevertheless, even the ﬂuid tensor can be analytically involved when

considering arbitrarily oriented wave vectors, a guiding magnetic ﬁeld, tem-

peratures, and so on [20]. Indeed, on can think about any model based on

whether the system is relativistic or not, collisional or not, magnetized or not,

hot or cold. . . Most of these models have not been implemented yet, and each

one should leave a quite complicated dielectric tensor.

This is why a Mathematica notebook has been developed which allows for the

symbolic calculation of the ﬂuid tensor, once the parameters of the system

have been set. The basic system we study here is a cold relativistic electron

beam entering a cold magnetized plasma with return current. As the reader

shall check, the notebook is very easy to adapt the diﬀerent scenarios (ion

beam, temperatures, pair plasma...). The paper is structured as follow: we

start introducing the theory leading to the ﬂuid dielectric tensor in section 2.

4

The Mathematica notebook is then explained step by step in section 3, and

we show how it can be modiﬁed to include temperatures or collisions before

the comments and conclusion section.

2 Theory

We consider a beam of density nb, velocity Vb and relativistic factor γb =

1/(1 − V 2

b /c2) entering a plasma of density np. Ions from the plasma are con-

sidered as a ﬁxed neutralizing background, and an electron plasma return

current ﬂows at velocity Vp such as npVp = nbVb. The system is thus charge

and current neutralized. We do not make any assumptions on the ratio nb/np

so that the return current can turn relativistic for beam densities approaching,

or even equalling, the plasma one. We set the z axis along the beam velocity

and align the static magnetic ﬁeld along this very axis. The wave vector inves-

tigated lies in the (x, z) plan without loss of generality [8], and we deﬁne the

angle θ between k and Vb k B0 k z through kz = k cos θ and kx = k sin θ. The

dielectric tensor of the system is obtained starting with the ﬂuid equations for

each species j = p for plasma electrons and j = b for the beam ones,

where pj = γjmvj, m the electron mass and q < 0 its charge. The equations

are then linearized according to a standard procedure [8], assuming small

variations of the variables according to exp(ik · r − iωt). With the subscripts

0 and 1 denoting the equilibrium and perturbed quantities respectively, the

where i2 = −1. Through Maxwell-Faraday equations, the ﬁeld B1 is then

replaced by (c/ω)k × E1 so that the perturbed velocities vj1 can be explained

in terms of E1 resolving the tensorial equations (4). Once the velocities are

obtained, the perturbed densities can be expressed in terms of the electric ﬁeld

using Eqs. (3). Finally, the linear expression of the current is found in terms

of E1 through,

J = q

and the system is closed combining Maxwell Faraday and Maxwell Amp`ere

Inserting the current expression from Eq. (5) into Eq. (6) yields an equation

of the kind T (E1) = 0, and the dispersion equation reads detT = 0.

The Mathematica notebook we describe in the next section performs a sym-

bolic computation of the tensor T and the dispersion equation detT = 0, in

6

terms of the usual [21] reduced variables of the problem

where ω2

p = 4πnpq2/m is the electron plasma frequency and ωb = |q|B0/mc

the electron cyclotron frequency.

3 Mathematica implementation

For the most part, Mathematica is used to solve the tensorial equations (4) for

vj1 and extract the tensors T from Eqs. (5,6). We start declaring the variables

corresponding to the wave vector, the electric ﬁeld, the beam and plasma drift

velocities and the magnetic ﬁeld,

In[1]:= k = {kx, 0, kz}; E1 = {E1x, E1y, E1z}; V0b = {0, 0, Vb};

V0p = {0, 0, Vp}; B0={0, 0, m c ωb/q}; B1 = c Cross[k, E1]/ω;

vb1 = {vb1x, vb1y, vb1z}; vp1 = {vp1x, vp1y, vp1z};

Note that Maxwell Faraday’s equation is already implemented in the deﬁnition

of B1. The wave vector has no component along the y axis and the beam and

plasma drift velocities only have one along the z axis. The guiding magnetic

ﬁeld is set along z and deﬁned in terms of the cyclotron frequency ωb. This

will be useful later when introducing the dimensionless parameters (7).

We then have Mathematica solve Eqs. (4) for the beam and the plasma. The

left hand side of the equation is not as simple as in the non-relativistic case

because the γ factors of the beam and the plasma modify the linearization

procedure. We write this part of the equations in a tensorial form in Mathe-

7

matica deﬁning the tensors Mp and Mb such as “left hand side”=Mj−1.vj1

with,

In[2]:= Mb={{

γb(ω−kzV b) ,0,0},{0,

γb(ω−kzV b) ,0},{0,0,

γb3(ω−kzV b) }};

i

In[3]:= Mp={{

γp(ω−kzV p),0,0},{0,

γp(ω−kzV p),0},{0,0,

γp3(ω−kzV p)}};

where i2 = −1. The reader will notice that relativistic eﬀects are more pro-

nounced in the beam direction due to the γ3 factors in the zz component. We

now have Mathematica solve the tensorial Eqs. (4). For better clarity, we ﬁrst

deﬁne them

In[4]:=EqVb=vb1-Dot[Mb, q
m

E1 + Cross[V0b+vb1,B0]

]-Dot[Mb, q

Cross[V0b,B1]

(cid:16)

c

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

before we solve them,

In[6]:=Vb1=FullSimplify[vb1/. Solve[EqVb==0,vb1][[1]]];

In[7]:=Vp1=FullSimplify[vp1/. Solve[EqVp==0,vp1][[1]]];

Note that the Vb’s, with capital “V”, store the solutions of the equations

whereas the vb’s are the variables. This is why the Vb’s do not need to be

deﬁned at the beginning (see In[1] ) of the notebook; they are implicitly deﬁned

here.

Now that we have the values of the perturbed velocities, we can derive the

perturbed densities from Eqs. (3),

In[8]:=Nb1=FullSimplify[ωpb2 m
4πq2

Dot[k,Vb1]
ω−Dot[k,V0b]];

In[9]:=Np1=FullSimplify[ωpp2 m
4πq2

Dot[k,Vp1]
ω−Dot[k,V0p]];

8

Here again, we prepare the introduction of the reduced variables (7) by ex-

pressing the equilibrium beam and plasma electronic densities in terms of the

beam and plasma electronic frequencies.

We can now have Mathematica calculate the current according to Eq. (5),

In[10]:=

J=FullSimplify[q
(cid:16)

ωpp2 m

4πq2 Vp1 + ωpb2 m

4πq2 Vb1+Np1V0p + Nb1V0b
(cid:17)

];

We now have the symbolic expression of the current J. In order to ﬁnd the

tensor T yielding the dispersion equation, we need to explain ﬁrst the current

tensor. This is performed through,

In[11]:=M=

Coeﬃcient[J[[1]], E1x] Coeﬃcient[J[[1]], E1y] Coeﬃcient[J[[1]], E1z]

Coeﬃcient[J[[2]], E1x] Coeﬃcient[J[[2]], E1y] Coeﬃcient[J[[2]], E1z]

Coeﬃcient[J[[3]], E1x] Coeﬃcient[J[[3]], E1y] Coeﬃcient[J[[3]], E1z]

which just extract the tensor elements from the expression of J. We now turn

to Eq. (6) where we explain the tensor elements of the quantity c2k × (k ×

E1) + ω2E1,

In[12]:=M0=c2 Cross[k,Cross[k,E1]]+ω2E1 ;

;







We can ﬁnally express the tensor T deﬁned by T (E)=0 as

In[14]:=T=M1+4 i π ω M;

At this stage of the notebook, we could take the determinant of the tensor

to obtain the dispersion equation. Let us ﬁrst introduce the dimensionless

variables (7) through,

In[15]:=T=T /. {Vp → −α Vb, kz → ωpp Zz/Vb, kx → ωpp Zx/Vb,

ωpb2 → α ωpp2, ω → x ωpp, ωb → Ωb ωpp};

Mathematica leaves here some ωpp’s which should simplify between each oth-

and,

In[16]:=T=T /. {Vb → β c}

ers. It is enough to perform

In[17]:=T=T /. {ωpp → 1};

and a simple

In[18]:=MatrixForm[FullSimplify[T]]

displays the result. The dispersion equation of the system is eventually ob-

10

tained through

In[19]:=DisperEq=Det[T]

The notebook evaluation takes 1 minute on a Laptop running a 1.5 GHz

Pentium Centrino under Windows XP Pro. This delay can be shortened down

to 10 seconds by suppressing all the FullSimplify routines while leaving a

Simplify[T] in entry 18, but the ﬁnal result is much less concise and readable.

4 Comments and Conclusion

In this paper, we have described a Mathematica notebook performing the

symbolic evaluation of the dielectric tensor of a beam plasma system. Start-

ing from the linearized ﬂuid equations, the notebook expresses the dielectric

tensor, and eventually the dispersion equation, is terms of some usual dimen-

sionless parameters. This notebook has been so far applied to the treatment

of the temperature dependant non magnetized and magnetized problems (see

Refs [19,20]). Indeed, the procedure is very easy to adapt to diﬀerent settings.

When including beam or plasma temperatures, one adds a pressure term

−∇Pj/nj on the right hand side of the force equations (2). Setting then

∇Pi = 3kBTi∇ni [12,22] if dealing only with electron motion, one only needs

to add to the notebook entries 4 and 5 the terms (i2=-1)

-3i Tj k Dot[k,vj1]

ω−Dot[k,V0j],

where j=p for the plasma, and b for the beam. When considering anisotropic

temperatures [19], one just needs to deﬁne a temperature tensor Tj for each

species j, and replace the scalar product Tj k by the tensorial one Dot[Tj,k]

11

in both entries. Of course, a correct treatment of electromagnetic instabilities

generally requires a kinetic formalism instead of a ﬂuid one. However, kinetic

calculations cannot be systematically entrusted to Mathematica, as is the case

here. The reason why is that the relativistic factors γ encountered in the

kinetic quadratures are coupling the integrations along the three components

of the momentum. According to the distribution functions considered, the

quadratures may be calculable through some ad hoc change of variables, if

they can be calculated at all. At any rate, the process cannot be systematized

enough for Mathematica to handle it.

As far as the magnetic ﬁeld is concerned, its direction can be changed from

entry 1 without any modiﬁcation of the next entries. When dealing with the

motion of ions, or even with one of these pair plasmas involved in the pulsar

problems [23], one just need to modify the conservation and force equations

according to the properties of the species investigated. It is even possible to

add more equations to account for more species because the resolution involves

only the force and the conservation equations of one single specie at a time

before the perturbed quantities merge together in entry 10 to compute the

current J.

The notebook can thus be easily adapted to diﬀerent settings and allows for a

quick symbolic calculation of the dielectric tensor and the dispersion equation,

even for an elaborated ﬂuid model.

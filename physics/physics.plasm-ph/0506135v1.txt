Radio frequency waves do not penetrate into a plasma and are damped within it. The electric
ﬁeld of the wave and plasma current are concentrated near the plasma boundary in a skin layer.
Electrons can transport the plasma current away from the skin layer due to their thermal motion.
As a result, the width of the skin layer increases when electron temperature eﬀects are taken into
account. This phenomenon is called anomalous skin eﬀect. The anomalous penetration of the rf
electric ﬁeld occurs not only for transversely propagating to the plasma boundary wave (inductively
coupled plasmas) but also for the wave propagating along the plasma boundary (capacitively coupled
plasmas). Such anomalous penetration of the rf ﬁeld modiﬁes the structure of the capacitive sheath.
Recent advances in the nonlinear, nonlocal theory of the capacitive sheath are reported.
It is
shown that separating the electric ﬁeld proﬁle into exponential and non-exponential parts yields an
eﬃcient qualitative and quantitative description of the anomalous skin eﬀect in both inductively
and capacitively coupled plasma.

INTRODUCTION

A radio frequency electromagnetic wave does not penetrate into a plasma if the wave frequency ω is smaller than
4πe2ne/m, where e and m are the electron charge and mass, respectively, and
the electron plasma frequency ωp =
ne is the electron density. Electrons distribute their charge and current so as to shield out the electromagnetic wave.
The shielding depends on the direction of the wave with regard to the plasma boundary. If the wave electric ﬁeld is
perpendicular to the plasma boundary, the rf ﬁeld penetrates into the plasma only within a depth of the order of the
2Te/m is the electron thermal velocity, determined by the electron temperature
Debye length vT /ωp, where vT =
Te, in eV. If the wave electric ﬁeld is along the plasma boundary, the rf ﬁeld penetrates into the plasma only within a
depth of the order of the skin depth c/ωp, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Here, we consider a “collisionless”
plasma, i.e. where the collision frequency is small compared to the wave frequency ν
ω and the electrons undergo
rare collisions during the rf cycle; thus, collisions have little eﬀect on wave screening by plasma.

Another important scale is the nonlocality or phase-mixing scale vT /ω, which determines the scale length of the
electron current proﬁle in the plasma. To demonstrate the concept of phase-mixing scale vT /ω let us consider a simple
model, where an electron acquires a prescribed velocity kick near the plasma boundary, in the direction perpendicular
to the boundary

The electron velocity at a distance x from the boundary will be determined by the moment when velocity kick was
x/vx. The electron current in the plasma is given by an
acquired at the plasma boundary, i.e., by the time t

the current is normalized on j0 = en0∆V , where n0 is plasma density. Solid lines show the exact result of numerical integration

Equation (4) describes the process of phase mixing - electrons with velocities diﬀerent by δvx ∼

vT have diﬀerent
phase lag of the order ωx/vT at a distance x from the plasma boundary. Therefore, at x
vT /ω the phase diﬀerence
becomes considerable: contributions to the total current from electrons with diﬀerent velocities vx cancel out each
other, and the plasma current vanishes. Interestingly, the spatial proﬁle of the current is not a simple exponential
function, but an exponential function of (x/λω)2/3. As it will be shown below this is typical for the spatial proﬁles of
the electric ﬁeld and electron current in warm plasmas due to nonlocal eﬀects.

∼

So far, we solved only test-particle problem and did not take into account the plasma polarization. The current in

Eq. (3) is nonuniform; thus, there must be an electron density perturbation according to the continuity equation

The electron density perturbations polarize the plasma and generate an electric ﬁeld, which in turn, aﬀects the electron
motion and the electron current proﬁle. Thus, Eq.(3) has to be modiﬁed to include the self-consistent electric ﬁeld.
This requires solving the Vlasov equation together with the Poisson equation. In his famous 1946 paper, Landau
obtained an analytic solution for the penetration of the longitudinal rf electric ﬁeld into a plasma [2]. Note that he
also described “Landau damping” in the same paper. We brieﬂy review his solution for a small amplitude electric
ﬁeld in the linear approximation and discuss the more realistic case of a large amplitude electric ﬁeld.

The structure of this review is as follows: In section II, the penetration of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld into the
plasma is described. This case corresponds to a capacitively coupled plasma. In section III, the penetration of the
transverse electric ﬁeld into the plasma is studied, which corresponds to an inductively coupled plasma. In subsection
III.E, it is shown that anisotropy of the electron velocity distribution function can have a profound eﬀect on the
anomalous skin eﬀect.

II. PENETRATION OF THE RF ELECTRIC FIELD DIRECTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE
PLASMA BOUNDARY (CAPACITIVELY-COUPLED PLASMA)

A. Small-amplitude electric ﬁeld

In the previous section, we considered a test particle current driven by artiﬁcially applied velocity modulations at the
plasma boundary. Here, self-consistent penetration of a small amplitude rf electric ﬁeld directed perpendicular to the
plasma boundary is considered. Such a model provides some insight into the sheath structure of capacitively-coupled
plasmas.

First, let’s consider a stationary negatively biased electrode. It is well-known that the externally applied electric

given by Eq.(11) and the approximate Eappr(x) given by Eq. (14), and asymptotic analytical result Estd(x) given by
Eq. (15) are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2 shows that the steepest descend method given by Eq. (15) closely approximates
Eq. (14) already for x > vT /ω. However, the both asymptotic solutions in Eq. (14) and Eq.(15) approximate the full
solution in Eq. (11) only for very large x > 40VT /ω. This is due to the made substitution ε(ω, k) by ε(ω, 0), which
results in a considerable error for k

This calculation can also be explained as follows: An electron has the oscillating velocity ∆us = eEbi/mω in a uniform

The origin of the electric ﬁeld in the transition region Et(x) is due to the plasma polarization. The velocity
perturbations ∆us(vx, t) produce bunches in the electron density, which, in turn, generate the electric ﬁeld Et(x).
The decay of the electric ﬁeld Et(x) is due to phase mixing similarly to the test-particle case in Eq. (4). Thus,
generation of the transitional electric ﬁeld Et(x) can be considered as a plasma self-consistency eﬀect.

The electric ﬁeld Et(x) generates a signiﬁcant portion of the total velocity kick and thus noticeably inﬂuences the
electron heating in the rf electric ﬁeld. Figure 3 shows the amplitude of the electron velocity kick ∆u(vx) due to the

In the intermediate range of velocities vx ∼

B. Large amplitude electric ﬁeld

In many practical applications, the value of the external electric ﬁeld is large: the potential drop in the sheath
region Vsh is typically of the order of hundreds of Volts and is much larger than the electron temperature Te, which
is of the order of a few Volts; consequently the electric ﬁeld penetration has to be treated nonlinearly.

6

In the limit Vsh ≫

Te, a wall is charged negatively all time with an alternating charge in a manner to conduct an
ac current, driven by an external electric circuit. A negative charge pushes electrons away from the electrode up to a
Te, the sheath width is much
distance where the negative electric ﬁeld is screened by a positive ion density. As Vsh ≫
larger than the Debye length and the plasma sheath boundary can be considered as inﬁnitely thin. The position of
the boundary is determined by the condition that the external electric ﬁeld is screened in the sheath regions when
and where electrons are absent [5, 7].

Electron interactions with the sheath electric ﬁeld are traditionally treated as collisions with a moving potential
barrier (wall). It is well known that multiple electron collisions with an oscillating wall result in electron heating,
provided there is suﬃcient phase-space randomization in the plasma bulk.
It is common to describe the sheath
heating by considering electrons as test particles, and neglecting the plasma electric ﬁeld [6]. As was pointed out in
Refs. [5, 8, 9] accounting for the electric ﬁeld in the plasma reduces the electron sheath heating, and the electron
sheath heating vanishes completely in the limit of uniform plasma density. Therefore, an accurate description of the
rf ﬁelds in the bulk of the plasma is necessary for calculating the sheath heating. The electron velocity is oscillatory in
the sheath, and as a result of these velocity modulations, the electron density bunches appear in the region adjacent
to the sheath, similar to the previously described case of small-amplitude wave, see Fig. 4. These electron density
perturbations decay due to phase mixing over a length of order vT /ω, where vT is the electron thermal velocity, and
ω is the frequency of the electric ﬁeld. The electron density perturbations polarize the plasma and produce an electric
ﬁeld in the plasma bulk. This electric ﬁeld, in turn, changes the velocity modulations and correspondingly inﬂuences
the electron density perturbations. Therefore, electron sheath heating has to be studied in a self-consistent nonlocal
manner assuming a ﬁnite-temperature plasma.

FIG. 4: Schematic of density bunches formation in the region adjacent to the sheath. The plasma-sheath boundary is shown
by bold solid line. Electrons with the same velocity vx and distance apart ∼ vx/ω collide with the sheath. The ﬁrst electron
looses its energy and decelerates, whereas the second acquire energy and accelerates. As a result, the distance between two
electrons decreases, which produces electron density perturbations.

Notwithstanding the fact that particle-in-cell simulations results have been widely available for the past decade
[10, 11], a basic understanding of the electron heating by the sheath electric ﬁeld is being incomplete, because no one
has studied the electric ﬁeld in the plasma bulk using a kinetic approach, similar to the anomalous skin eﬀect for the
inductive electric ﬁeld [3]. In this regard, analytical models are of great importance because they shed light on the
most complicated features of collisionless electron interactions with the sheath. In Ref.[12], an analytical model was
developed to explore the eﬀects associated with the self-consistent non-local nature of this phenomenon.

One of the approaches to study electron sheath heating is based on a ﬂuid description of the electron dynamics.
For the collisionless case, closure assumptions for the viscosity and heat ﬂuxes are necessary.
In most cases, the
closure assumptions are made empirically or phenomenologically [11], [13]. The closure assumptions have to be
justiﬁed by direct comparison with the results of kinetic calculations as is done, for example, in Refs.
[14, 15].
Otherwise, inaccurate closure assumptions may lead to misleading results as discussed below. To model the sheath-
plasma interaction analytically, the following simplifying assumptions have been adopted in Ref. [12]. The discharge
frequency is assumed to be small compared with the electron plasma frequency. Therefore, most of the external
electric ﬁeld is screened in the sheath region by an ion space charge. The ion response time is typically larger than

the inverse discharge frequency, and the ion density proﬁle is quasi-stationary. There is an ion ﬂow from the plasma
bulk towards the electrodes. In the sheath region, ions are being accelerated towards the electrode by the large sheath
electric ﬁeld, and the ion density in the sheath region is small compared with the bulk ion density. In the present
analytical treatment, the ion density proﬁle is assumed ﬁxed and is modelled in a two-step approximation: the ion
density nb is uniform in the plasma bulk, and the ion density in the sheath nsh < nb is also uniform (see Fig. 5). At
the sheath-plasma boundary, there is a stationary potential barrier for the electrons (eΦsh), so that only the energetic
electrons reach the sheath region. The potential barrier is determined by the quasineutrality condition, i.e., when the
energetic electrons enter the sheath region, their instantaneous density is equal to the ion density [ne(Φsh) = nsh].

The electron density proﬁle is time-dependent in response to the time-varying sheath electric ﬁeld. The large sheath
electric ﬁeld does not penetrate into the plasma bulk. Therefore, the quasineutrality condition holds in the plasma
bulk, i.e., the electron density is equal to ion density, ne = nb. In the sheath region, the electrons are reﬂected by the
large sheath electric ﬁeld. Therefore, ne = nsh for x > xsh(t), and ne = 0 for x < xsh(t), where xsh(t) is the position
J = 0, where the total current J is
of the plasma-sheath boundary [5]. From Maxwell’s equations it follows that
J = 0

the ion space charge screening of the sheath electric ﬁeld. The position of the plasma-sheath boundary xsh(t) is
determined by the zero of the sheath electric ﬁeld, Esh[xsh(t), t] = 0. From Eq. (23) it follows that

an electron ﬂux on the electrode. However, for a very short time (ωtn + φ
π(1 + 2n)) the sheath electric ﬁeld
vanishes, allowing electrons to ﬂow to the electrode for compensation of the ion ﬂux. Note that there is a large
diﬀerence between the sheath structure in the discharge and the sheath for obliquely incident waves interacting with
a plasma slab without any bounding walls. Because electrodes are absent, electrons can move outside the plasma,
and the electric ﬁeld in the vacuum region, Esh(x, t) = (4πj0/ω) cos(ωt + φ), may have an alternating sign. Therefore,
electrons may penetrate into the region of large electric ﬁeld during the time when Esh(x, t) > 0 [16, 17]. In the
discharge, however, because the sheath electric ﬁeld given by Eq. (23) always reﬂects electrons, the electrons never
enter the region of the large sheath electric ﬁeld, which is opposite to the case of obliquely incident waves.

The calculations based on the two-step ion density proﬁle model are known to yield discharge characteristics in

good agreement with experimental data and full-scale simulations [18].

For analytical calculation of the rf electric ﬁeld inside the plasma, a linear approximation is used for the plasma
conductivity. The validity of the linear approximation is based on the fact that the plasma-sheath boundary velocity
vT , [7, 10]. The
and the mean electron ﬂow velocity are small compared with the electron thermal velocity, Vsh ≪
λω because
important spatial scale is the length scale for phase mixing, λω. The sheath width satisﬁes 2Vsh0/ω
vT . Therefore, the sheath width is neglected, and electron interactions with the sheath electric ﬁeld are treated
Vsh ≪
as a boundary condition. The collision frequency (ν) is assumed to be small compared with the discharge frequency
(ν
ω), and correspondingly the mean free path is much larger than the length scale for phase mixing. Therefore,
the electron dynamics is assumed to be collisionless. The discharge gap is considered to be suﬃciently large compared
with the electron mean free path, so that the inﬂuence of the opposite sheath is neglected. The eﬀects of a ﬁnite gap
width have been discussed in Refs. [19, 20].

The electron interaction with the large electric ﬁeld in the sheath is modelled as a collision with a moving oscillating
rigid barrier with velocity Vsh(t) = dxsh(t)/dt. After a collision with the plasma-sheath boundary - modelled as a
rigid barrier moving with velocity Vsh(t) - an electron with initial velocity
u acquires a velocity u + 2Vsh. Therefore,
the power deposition density transfer from the oscillating plasma-sheath boundary is given by [5]

Vsh is the electron velocity relative to the oscillating rigid barrier. From Eq.(26) it follows that,
if the function g(u′) is stationary, then (Psh = 0) and there is no collisionless power deposition due to electron
interaction with the sheath [5, 13, 21]. For example, in the limit of a uniform ion density proﬁle nsh = nb, g(u′) is
stationary (in an oscillating reference frame of the plasma-sheath boundary), and the electron heating vanishes [5],
Indeed, in the plasma bulk, the displacement current is small compared with the electron current, and from
[7].
Eq. (22) it follows that the electron mean ﬂow velocity in the plasma bulk, Vb(t) =
j0 sin(ωt + φ)/enb, is equal to
the plasma-sheath velocity Vsh(t), from Eq. (24). Therefore, the electron motion in the plasma is strongly correlated
with the plasma-sheath boundary motion. From the electron momentum equation it follows that there is an electric
ﬁeld, Eb = m/e dVb(t)/dt, in the plasma bulk. In a frame of reference moving with the electron mean ﬂow velocity,
the sheath barrier is stationary, and there is no force acting on the electrons, because the electric ﬁeld is compensated
mdVb(t)/dt = 0). Therefore, electron interaction with the sheath electric ﬁeld is totally
by the inertial force (eEb −
compensated by the inﬂuence of the bulk electric ﬁeld, and the collisionless heating vanishes [8]. The example of a
uniform density proﬁle shows the importance of a self-consistent treatment of the collisionless heating in the plasma.
If the function g(u′, t) is nonstationary, there is net power deposition. In Ref. [12], a kinetic calculation is performed
to yield the correct electron velocity distribution function g(u′, t) and, correspondingly, the net power deposition.

The solution for the electric ﬁeld Et(x) was obtained analytically in Ref.[12]. Similar to the previous section, the
solution is an expression for the inverse Fourier transform. It cannot be represented in an analytical form and has to
be simulated numerically. This simulation has been performed for nsh/nb = 1/3, ω/ωp = 1/100, and a Maxwellian
electron distribution function. The electric ﬁeld proﬁle is close to Et(x)
0.72Te/λω,
and λc = (0.19 + 0.77i)λω for x < 6VT /ω. For x > 6VT /ω, the electric ﬁeld proﬁle is no longer a simple exponential
function, which is similar to the case considered in the previous section. The diﬀerence in phase of the currents of
the energetic and low-energy electrons was observed in Ref.[11], but it was misinterpreted as the generation of the
electron acoustic waves. Electron acoustic waves can be excited if there is a complex value of k, with small damping
Re(k ), which is the root of the plasma dielectric function ε(ω, k) = 0 for a given ω. For a Maxwellian
Im(k )
electron distribution function, such root does not exist when ω
ωp. However, the electron acoustic waves can exist
if the plasma contains two groups of electrons which have very diﬀerent temperatures [24]. The wave phase velocity
is ω/k =
Th/m , where nc and nh are the electron densities of cold and hot electrons, respectively, and
Th is the temperature of the hot electrons. The electron acoustic waves are strongly damped by the hot electrons,
p
Th , where Tc is the electron temperature of the cold electrons [24]. In the opposite limit,
unless nc ≪
nc > 4nh, the electron acoustic waves do not exist [24]. In capacitively-coupled discharges, the electron population
does stratify into two populations of cold and hot electrons, as has been observed in experiments [27] and simulation
studies [25, 26]. Cold electrons trapped by the plasma potential in the discharge center do not interact with the large
electric ﬁelds in the sheath region and have low temperature. Moreover, because of the nonlinear evolution of plasma
proﬁles, the cold electron density is much larger than the hot electron density [25]. Therefore, weakly-damped electron
acoustic waves do not exist in the plasma of capacitively-coupled discharges. Reference [11] used the ﬂuid equation
and neglected the eﬀect of collisionless dissipation, thus arriving at the incorrect conclusion about the existence of
weakly-damped electron acoustic waves.

Interestingly, taking into account only the uniform electric ﬁeld Eb gives a result close to the case when both Eb and
E1 are accounted for. The electric ﬁeld E1 redistributes the power deposition from the energetic electrons to the low
energy electrons, but does not change the total power deposition (compare lines (a) and (b) in Fig.6 and Fig. 7).

The result of the self-consistent calculation of the power dissipation in Eq. (31) diﬀers from the non-self-consistent
estimate by the last term in Eq. (31), which contributes corrections of order nsh/nb to the main term.

A future development should provide a self-consistent analysis of a more realistic, nonuniform, and self-consistent

ion density proﬁle ni(x). Such study has been currently performed for inductively coupled discharges only.

III. PENETRATION OF THE RF ELECTRIC FIELD INTO AN INDUCTIVELY-COUPLED PLASMA

Low pressure inductively-coupled rf discharges are often operated in the non-propagating regime, when the driving
rf ﬁeld penetrates into plasma only within a skin layer of width δ near the antenna, i.e., exhibits a skin eﬀect. Not
only the rf ﬁeld, but, in this case, also the resulting induced electric current is concentrated near the surface of the
plasma. Depending on the local, or non-local nature of the relation between the electric current j induced in plasma
and the rf electric ﬁeld E, the skin eﬀect is called normal, if the dependence of the current on the electric ﬁeld is
local, or anomalous, if the dependence of the current on the electric ﬁeld is nonlocal [29].

To diﬀerentiate between the two regimes of the skin eﬀect, it is convenient to introduce the nonlocality parameter
vT /(ω2 + ν2)1/2 is the eﬀective electron mean free path and

[31] Λ = (λ/δ0)2, where λ

≡

is the depth of the normal skin eﬀect. The parameter Λ

is a fundamental measure of plasma current non-locality. In the local limit Λ
small compared with the skin depth λ
as a function of the electric ﬁeld at the same point j(x) = σ(x)E(x) (Ohm’s law). In the opposite limit λ
mean free path exceeds the skin depth λ
is no longer local, because the conductivity σ(x, x′) has a spatial dispersion.

The case of anomalous skin eﬀect (Λ

1) for low-pressure inductively-coupled plasmas is more complicated com-
paring to the case of normal skin eﬀect, and requires a more elaborate mathematical and numerical treatment to
uncover its intrinsic complexity. In the limit Λ
1, the electron mean free path is large compared with the skin
depth, and the electron current is determined not by the local rf electric ﬁeld (Ohm’s law), but rather is a function of
the whole proﬁle of the rf electric ﬁeld over distances of order λ. Therefore, a rather complicated nonlocal conductivity
operator has to be determined for the calculation of the rf electric ﬁeld penetration into the plasma.

The most apparent diﬀerence between the anomalous skin eﬀect and the normal skin eﬀect is that the amplitude
of the rf ﬁled is non-monotonic in the limit of anomalous skin eﬀect and monotonic (exponential) for the normal skin
eﬀect. Moreover, in the case of the extremely anomalous skin eﬀect, in the limit Λ
1, the spatially averaged rf
electric ﬁeld tends to zero [9]

Substituting the Fourier component of the electric ﬁeld from Eq.(43) into Eq.(54) gives

From Eq. (56) it is evident that as the nonlocality parameter tends to inﬁnity, the averaged electric ﬁeld tends to
zero. This property of the electric ﬁeld proﬁle is consistent with nonlocality of the electron current. The electric ﬁeld
proﬁle and the current proﬁle are coupled to each other by Eq. (36). Therefore, the main part of the current and the
electric ﬁeld should decay on distances of order δa, see Fig. 9. However, if the electric ﬁeld proﬁle has a non-zero
average, the fast electrons will pick up a velocity kick from the skin layer and will transport the current over distances
of order vT /ω
δa, where the electric ﬁeld vanishes. This would contradict Maxwell’s equations. Therefore, the
zero average of the electric ﬁeld is necessary and an important property of the electric ﬁeld proﬁle in the limit of the

This result contradicts to claim of Refs.[33, 35], that the magnetic ﬁeld and current penetration lengths are much
longer than the electric ﬁeld penetration length. This claim is the result of an inaccurate deﬁnition of the penetration
length.

In an attempt to reduce the phenomenon of the anomalous skin eﬀect to the normal skin eﬀect, many authors
have substituted the correct proﬁle of the electric ﬁeld in Eq. (47) by an exponential proﬁle E0 exp(
x/δe) with some
ﬁtting procedure for δe [36, 37, 38]. By doing so, the property of the electric ﬁeld in the limit of anomalous skin eﬀect
in Eq.(53) is violated. This leads to overestimation of the electron heating [9]. Under the conditions of the anomalous

from the real axis k < 0, Imk = 0, into the complex k -plane, see Appendix C for details. The ﬁrst integral can be
readily calculated using the theory of residues. In the upper half-plane of the complex k, there exists only one pole of
the analytically continued function of the plasma permittivity continued from k < 0. The value of the pole is equal

is the magnetic ﬁeld near the antenna. The total power P deposited per unit area into the plasma is determined by

Substituting the electric ﬁeld from Eq.(78) and the magnetic ﬁeld Eq. (79) into Eq. (80) relates the power to the real

The imaginary part of the surface impedance describes the plasma inductance.

The surface impedance can also be used to estimate the penetration length in the surface impedance approximation

Because the imaginary part of impedance is large compared with its real part, only the imaginary part can be included
on the right hand side in Eq. (86). Figure 12 shows the real and imaginary parts of the surface impedance versus the
discharge frequency calculated exactly, i.e., making use of Eq.(83), and approximately from Eqs. (84) and (86). Also
shown at the top of this ﬁgure, is the ratio of the actual skin depth δ = 1/kp from Eq. (75) to the normal skin depth
calculated in the cold plasma approximation δ0 given by Eq.(32). From Fig. 12 it is evident that within 50% accuracy,
the impedance calculation can be based on the exponential proﬁle in Eq. (76) for discharge frequencies higher than 1
MHz [37]. However, for lower frequencies, the assumption of purely exponential proﬁle leads to overestimation of the
electron heating and plasma resistivity up to a factor of 3 for f
1 MHz, see Fig. 12. This is because the important
property of the electric ﬁeld proﬁle under the conditions of strong anomalous skin eﬀect in Eq. (53) is being violated.
Note that at these low frequencies taking into account a small but ﬁnite collision frequency or nonlinear eﬀects may
be important.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We showed that electrons can transport the plasma current away from the skin layer due to their thermal motion
over distances of order vT /ω. As a result, the width of the skin layer increases when electron temperature eﬀects
are taken into account. The anomalous penetration of the rf electric ﬁeld occurs not only for the wave transversely
propagating to the plasma boundary (inductively coupled plasmas), but also for the wave propagating along the plasma
boundary (capacitively coupled plasmas).
It was shown that separating the electric ﬁeld proﬁle into exponential
and nonexponential parts yields an eﬃcient qualitative and quantitative description of the anomalous skin eﬀect.
Accounting for the non-exponential part of the proﬁle is important for the calculation of the electron heating and the
plasma resistivity. For example, the assumption of purely exponential proﬁle leads to overestimation of up to a factor
of 3 in the electron heating for f

1 MHz, see Fig. 12.

Here, we considered only plasmas with a Maxwellian electron energy distribution function. However, in low pressure
rf discharges, the EEDF is non-Maxwellian for plasma densities typically lower than 1010cm−3 [32]. The nonlocal
conductivity, and plasma density proﬁles and EEDF are all nonlinear and nonlocally coupled [39]. Hence, for accurate
calculation of the discharge characteristics at low pressures, the EEDF needs to be computed self-consistently [41, 42,
43, 44]. The eﬀects of a nonMaxwellian EEDF, nonlinear phenomena, the eﬀects of plasma non-uniformity and ﬁnite
size,as well as inﬂuence of the external magnetic ﬁeld on the anomalous skin eﬀect will be reported in the second part
of the review [45].

Ref. [2] Landau solved the linearized Vlasov-Poisson system making use of the Laplace transform for a semi-inﬁnite
plasma x > 0. However, it is more convenient to apply a Fourier transform to an inﬁnite plasma by artiﬁcially
continuing the EVDF and the electric ﬁeld in the semi-plane x < 0 [9]. Electrons moving with vx < 0 reﬂect from the
boundary x = 0 and change their velocity to
vx. This gives the boundary condition for the Vlasov equation in the

APPENDIX C: ANALYTICAL DERIVATION OF THE TRANSVERSE RF ELECTRIC FIELD PROFILE
NEAR THE PLASMA BOUNDARY (E ⊥ k)

The analytical solution involves solving the Vlasov equation for the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF)

F

This equation has to be solved together with the Maxwell’s equation yielding

where I is the surface current. The plasma density is not perturbed in the transverse wave; therefore there is no need
to solve the Poisson equation. In the linear approximation, the EVDF can be split into two parts

where f0(v) describes EVDF of an isotropic, uniform plasma with uniform ion density ne = ni = n0 and f (t, x, v) is
the EVDF due a wave perturbation. Substituting Eq. (C3) into Eqs. (C1) yields the linearized Vlasov equation
